1
00:00:58,127 --> 00:00:59,082
Hi.

2
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:02,965
Okay, here she is, folks.
Kitty Dean.

3
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:17,202
What is this thing called love?

4
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:21,522
This funny thing called love.

5
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:25,917
Just who can solve its mystery?

6
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:30,004
Why should it make a fool of me?

7
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:34,962
I saw you there one wonderful day.

8
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:39,282
You took my heart
and threw it away.

9
00:01:39,607 --> 00:01:43,156
That's why I ask the Lord
in heaven above.

10
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:47,476
What is this thing called love?

11
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:10,282
You gave me days of sunshine.

12
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:14,484
You gave me nights of cheer.

13
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:20,318
You made my life
an enchanted dream

14
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:24,396
till somebody else came near.

15
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:43,006
Somebody else came near you.

16
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:50,239
I felt the winter's chill.

17
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:57,277
And now

18
00:02:59,207 --> 00:03:02,244
I sit and wonder night and day

19
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,760
why I love you still.

20
00:03:24,727 --> 00:03:28,117
What is this thing called love?

21
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:32,723
It's a funny thing called love.

22
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:37,317
Just who can solve its mystery?

23
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:40,886
Why should it make a fool of me?

24
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:42,241
That a girl, Kitty!

25
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:46,163
I saw you there one wonderful day.

26
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:50,717
You took my heart
and threw it away.

27
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:55,120
That's why I ask the Lord
in heaven above.

28
00:03:56,327 --> 00:03:59,558
What is this thing called love?

29
00:04:43,287 --> 00:04:47,485
It’s 38 degrees in New York
this morning. The time is 10:49.

30
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:21,800
Should I call and get our table
for lunch?

31
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,840
Goodie-good.

32
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:29,398
And Big Mama?
Bring lots of gossip.

33
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:33,438
Everything about him
is designed to rivet.

34
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:35,916
The appearance, the demeanor,

35
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:37,918
and of course, the voice.

36
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:40,076
The voice?

37
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:44,405
To the lucky person
who has never heard it,

38
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,355
I can only say,

39
00:05:48,007 --> 00:05:50,965
imagine what a Brussel sprout
would sound like

40
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:54,039
if a Brussel sprout could talk.

41
00:05:54,207 --> 00:05:55,435
He's so magical...

42
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:57,566
you soon forget

43
00:05:57,727 --> 00:06:00,639
the most unforgettable sound
in the world.

44
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:02,925
Here's a word I loathe:

45
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:05,601
eccentric.
Eccentric is a word

46
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:09,646
boring people use to describe
someone I think of as interesting.

47
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:12,719
A great many people think of me
as eccentric simply because

48
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:16,402
when I have my shoes polished,
the entire shoe polished,

49
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:18,478
top, sides and soles.

50
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:20,640
Some people think it is eccentric

51
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:23,879
that every morning
I have my maid iron my money.

52
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:28,277
When I told Truman I had my maid
iron my money, know what he said?

53
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:31,041
Here's what he didn't say:
''How eccentric.''

54
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:34,643
Here's what he did say:
''How wonderful!''

55
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:39,124
You can forgive a person a lot
who really enjoys you.

56
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:42,680
He's loads of fun,
wherever you go.

57
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:45,720
He's the rarest thing in the world,
a good talker

58
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:47,684
who is also a good listener.

59
00:06:47,847 --> 00:06:50,759
How could Leland ever
have been bored with you?

60
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:53,885
Even someone who doesn't speak
English can look at you.

61
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:57,517
He listened to me like I was an
announcement in a train station,

62
00:06:57,687 --> 00:07:00,281
just enough to hear
if there's an emergency.

63
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:05,685
Oh, well. He's with Pamela
and I need to move on.

64
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:07,121
Maybe you can,

65
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:10,882
but tout New York is dividing
into the Slim or Pamela camps.

66
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:12,958
Babe and I are the head Slimites.

67
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:15,080
Tru Heart.

68
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,120
Have you heard about Tracy?

69
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:20,278
Yeah. Having her eyes done,
I know.

70
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:24,759
Well, a little more than that.
She's gone off to have an abortion.

71
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,839
Who's the father?
I presume not Dick.

72
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,642
Chas Fitzgerald.

73
00:07:30,807 --> 00:07:32,638
Perfect. Does Dick know?

74
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:35,037
I think she should just
tell Dick it's his.

75
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:36,606
She can't. Dick's infertile.

76
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:37,563
What?

77
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:40,481
Everybody knows that.

78
00:07:40,647 --> 00:07:42,239
Well I'm sure they do now.

79
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:43,840
Did you see the paper?

80
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:48,717
Yes. There's a story that's stuck
in my teeth like a piece of candy.

81
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:50,081
What is it?

82
00:07:51,327 --> 00:07:54,558
Well, these well-to-do farm people
out in Kansas

83
00:07:54,727 --> 00:07:56,763
were murdered
in the middle of the night

84
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,395
in the most gruesome way
imaginable.

85
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:01,319
Do they have any idea who did it?

86
00:08:01,487 --> 00:08:02,715
No idea.

87
00:08:02,887 --> 00:08:05,481
But that won't affect the piece
I want to write for you.

88
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:08,639
I want to explore how a crime
like this affects a town

89
00:08:08,807 --> 00:08:11,162
where everyone trusts each other.

90
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:14,239
It may be preferable that we don't
know the identity of the killers.

91
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:18,798
Exactly. Because what I imagine
everyone is now afraid of is:

92
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:21,845
''Who among us
did this horrible thing?''

93
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:26,717
It used to be you'd think:
''There's old Mr. Busybody.''

94
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:28,400
Now you think:

95
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:30,125
''Did you do it?''

96
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:33,199
I can't bear the thought
of you going to Kansas.

97
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:35,323
Whom will I talk to?

98
00:08:35,487 --> 00:08:38,479
Oh, that reminds me.
Did you hear about Tracy?

99
00:08:38,647 --> 00:08:40,000
The eyes?

100
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:41,202
More.

101
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:42,800
Abortion.

102
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:46,243
I just saw her at Sotheby's.
She bought an adorable Degas.

103
00:08:46,407 --> 00:08:48,045
I wanted it for the guest bath,

104
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:52,086
but Bill wants to put the little
Giacometti in the hall there.

105
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:55,922
Tell him nobody wants to find
a little man in the bathroom.

106
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:59,045
I know it from bitter
personal experience.

107
00:08:59,207 --> 00:09:00,526
T-Bone...

108
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:03,121
How did you find out about Tracy?

109
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:06,996
Slim. But I'm absolutely
sworn to secrecy.

110
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:11,365
I'm only telling you
because you're my dearest friend.

111
00:09:11,847 --> 00:09:12,484
Nelle...

112
00:09:12,647 --> 00:09:17,084
As my oldest and dearest friend, do
you think the Kansas thing is good?

113
00:09:17,247 --> 00:09:18,521
Are you joking?

114
00:09:18,687 --> 00:09:22,316
That small town stuff,
that suspicion, that gossip?

115
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:25,445
That is your world as much as this,
maybe even more.

116
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:27,920
How were they killed?

117
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:29,361
Shotgun.

118
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:33,043
But there's a caretaker
not 100 yards from the house.

119
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:36,483
How could he not hear 4 gunshots
in the dead of night?

120
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:38,319
Maybe he did it.

121
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:39,602
Did you consider that?

122
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:40,756
Maybe.

123
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:45,557
Though the victims were bound and
gagged which suggests at least two.

124
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,195
One with the gun
to make them cooperate,

125
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:52,326
and one to tie them up
and make them sorry they cooperated.

126
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:55,277
The father and boy
were shot in the basement,

127
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:57,642
the mother and girl in their beds.

128
00:09:57,927 --> 00:09:59,645
How do you know all this?

129
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,525
I called the D.A.

130
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:03,644
May I tell him who's calling,
please?

131
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:06,037
Yes, dear.
This is Truman Capote.

132
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,404
I'm sorry. The D.A doesn't take
calls from strange women.

133
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:13,600
And what did you say?

134
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:16,357
Who says I'm strange?

135
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:22,559
They can judge for themselves soon
enough. I'm going there in a week.

136
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:25,926
Which of your pillbox hats
do you think they'll like best?

137
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:32,085
Why didn't Jack come tonight?
If he's your fella, he's welcome.

138
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:33,996
Truman and I...

139
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:37,122
had a taste for
one another's company

140
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:38,481
above all others,

141
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:42,965
but we weren't a together wherever
you go couple. He's very social.

142
00:10:43,687 --> 00:10:44,961
I'm not.

143
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:49,204
Especially with... that crowd.

144
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,319
Jack didn't

145
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:53,599
approve of us.

146
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:56,964
He has the social graces
of a syringe.

147
00:10:57,127 --> 00:11:01,200
Jack is just so iron, you know,
he's so, ''That's that.''

148
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:03,805
Before he knew Truman

149
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:07,926
he was married to a darling actress
named Joan McCracken.

150
00:11:08,087 --> 00:11:12,399
They were dancers together in
''Oklahoma'' and he was mad for her.

151
00:11:13,287 --> 00:11:16,245
And then the war came,
and he went away and came back.

152
00:11:16,407 --> 00:11:19,285
And she told him that
she'd had an affair.

153
00:11:19,447 --> 00:11:22,166
Well, he was so humiliated

154
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:25,637
that not only did he end
their marriage that night,

155
00:11:25,807 --> 00:11:29,925
but he stopped sleeping with women
altogether and he switched to men.

156
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:31,435
Can you imagine?

157
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:35,964
Curing your distaste for infidelity
by turning to men?

158
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,280
What if one of the people
you interview is the killer?

159
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:43,165
And what if he thinks you know?

160
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,000
He's already committed 4 murders,
you think he'll spare you?

161
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:49,682
Honey, is this your funny way of
saying you're worried about me?

162
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:52,315
-Doesn't it seem dangerous?
-Come with me, then.

163
00:11:52,487 --> 00:11:55,001
I can't. I'm trying
to write my book.

164
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:57,522
Well, then it's O sole mio,
off I go!

165
00:11:58,687 --> 00:12:00,405
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

166
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:02,683
Honey, I'm indestructible.

167
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:05,762
Much to everyone's regret.

168
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:07,281
Not mine.

169
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:11,162
Come with me.
Your book's all done.

170
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:12,601
Well, I am intrigued,

171
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:16,316
but I want to get started on my new
book before ''Mockingbird'' comes out.

172
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:21,359
How near did you say the caretaker
lived to the main house?

173
00:12:22,887 --> 00:12:24,400
Nelle grew up with him in Alabama.

174
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:28,879
She based the other little boy in
''To Kill a Mockingbird'' on Truman.

175
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:31,959
Aptly enough,
she named the child Dill.

176
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,880
People always mention
his effervescence,

177
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:37,561
but one must remember

178
00:12:37,727 --> 00:12:40,161
that at the center
of any bright flame

179
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:43,876
there's always that
little touch of blue.

180
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:49,443
Truman's parents deserted him
at an early age,

181
00:12:49,607 --> 00:12:52,405
leaving him with elderly relations
in my town.

182
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:56,680
And Truman always disguised his
shame over their absence

183
00:12:56,847 --> 00:13:00,886
with grand tales of adventure
and glory.

184
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,285
''My daddy can't be here,
he's an aviator.''

185
00:13:05,887 --> 00:13:09,436
''My mother's a photographic subject,
but they're coming for me.''

186
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:12,280
He would always say,
''They're coming for me.''

187
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:15,761
Every year at Christmas,

188
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:19,602
our elementary school did a pageant
through the center of town.

189
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:24,477
And one year, Truman wrote his
parents that he was the star

190
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:27,925
though he was only a snowflake,
like me.

191
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,962
But no matter, it worked.

192
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:35,437
They wired him to say they'd take
the train from New Orleans

193
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:39,202
and get there just in time to see
the pageant. They even said

194
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:42,882
they'd stand right by the cannon
in the square to cheer him on.

195
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,166
Well, we marched through town

196
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:49,201
and as we got closer
to that cannon

197
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:53,121
I could see him straining
to see his parents.

198
00:13:53,887 --> 00:13:57,766
When we got to that cannon,
he stopped,

199
00:13:58,407 --> 00:14:02,400
forgetting we were supposed to be
marching in time to the music.

200
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:05,035
He stopped and he stared.

201
00:14:09,527 --> 00:14:11,199
They had not come.

202
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:18,566
I thought for a minute
he might break.

203
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:24,763
And then he threw his arms
up in the air

204
00:14:24,927 --> 00:14:28,636
and twirled himself
all the way over.

205
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,965
A cartwheel.

206
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,846
And then again. And again...

207
00:14:40,807 --> 00:14:42,957
all the way down the street

208
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,803
till his tears were gone.

209
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:49,204
Truman adored Nelle.

210
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:53,326
She and Jack were just about
his only non-society friends.

211
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:57,039
I will say it stung him
when she won the Pulitzer.

212
00:14:57,287 --> 00:15:01,997
He might not have minded her winning
one, but only if he'd already won 2.

213
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:04,841
I've always been interested
in crime.

214
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:08,005
Daddy was a lawyer,
and Sister too.

215
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,317
I studied the law as well,

216
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:15,397
but I either lost my nerve or came
to my senses before taking the bar.

217
00:15:15,807 --> 00:15:18,685
But when Truman asked me
to go to Kansas,

218
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:21,916
it was deep calling to deep.

219
00:15:58,127 --> 00:15:59,879
Detective Dewey!

220
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:02,607
-Do you have any leads yet?
-Nothing I can discuss.

221
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:04,405
-Detective Dewey.
-Jimmy.

222
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:06,558
Yeah. Will you confirm that
there is more than one killer?

223
00:16:06,727 --> 00:16:07,557
No.

224
00:16:07,727 --> 00:16:11,037
Of course there was more than one,
unless the killer was a hypnotist.

225
00:16:11,207 --> 00:16:12,720
Beg your pardon, ma'am?

226
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:16,796
It's illogical to suppose
there's only one killer.

227
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:20,880
The Clutters were tied up.
He'd have to put his gun down.

228
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:24,562
Once he put the gun down,
they would have run for the hills.

229
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:26,638
I don't believe
I know who you are.

230
00:16:26,807 --> 00:16:27,762
Or what.

231
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:31,440
I'm from out of town.

232
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:34,724
-What's your paper?
-Ladies Home Journal.

233
00:16:34,887 --> 00:16:38,118
I'm not a reporter,
I'm a writer.

234
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:41,365
May I see your press card?

235
00:16:41,527 --> 00:16:44,439
Good heavens, I don't carry
any such thing.

236
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:48,083
But I do have a passport
back at my hotel room.

237
00:16:48,327 --> 00:16:51,046
Would you like to come back
and look at my little picture?

238
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:55,597
I'll need not only the facts
of the case

239
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:59,362
but how this terrible crime has
eaten at the foundation of trust

240
00:16:59,527 --> 00:17:01,085
that makes up your community.

241
00:17:01,247 --> 00:17:02,316
I see. No.

242
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:03,920
And I... What?

243
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:06,555
No reporter has special access.

244
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:11,039
Sir, I'm not writing a news story.
I'm from the New Yorker magazine.

245
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:14,199
I'm writing a psychological study
of a village

246
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,279
and how that place is affected
by a vicious crime.

247
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:20,086
I will not be careless
in my depiction.

248
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,159
I shall labor over every word,
every sound.

249
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:25,443
The final result must be just

250
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:28,326
so as dazzling and unique
as a Fabergé egg.

251
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:30,079
Right. And I got a crime to solve.

252
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:32,886
But I don't care whether
the crime is solved or not.

253
00:17:33,047 --> 00:17:34,560
I sure as hell care.

254
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:38,356
The Clutters went to our church.
They were friends of my family's.

255
00:17:38,527 --> 00:17:40,040
No access.

256
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,360
You are very, very foxy.

257
00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:47,360
I can see I'm gonna have
to work extra hard

258
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:50,405
to get around that
foxy manner of yours.

259
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:52,046
Isn't he foxy?

260
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:54,163
But don't you worry, I...

261
00:17:57,207 --> 00:18:00,165
It was lovely how you didn't care
whether the murder was solved.

262
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:01,726
-Lovely.
-Quiet.

263
00:18:01,887 --> 00:18:03,605
Would you folks care
for a cocktail?

264
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:05,200
Yes, a gin and tonic, please.

265
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:06,766
I’ll have J and B on the rocks,

266
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:10,158
with a tiny curl of lemon
and a splash and a half of water.

267
00:18:10,647 --> 00:18:13,115
A what, on the rocks?

268
00:18:13,287 --> 00:18:14,720
J and B.

269
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,402
It's a type of Scotch, dear.

270
00:18:18,727 --> 00:18:20,957
You want me to see
if we've got any?

271
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:23,283
That would be a wonderful beginning.

272
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:24,516
Yes, ma'am.

273
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:30,643
I think we need to come in
a little under the radar here.

274
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:32,399
I know where you are headed,
but you

275
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:36,276
of all people know how impossible
it is for me to modify myself.

276
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:38,881
I'm not saying get married
and have kids,

277
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:41,481
but maybe come in
on little cat's paws.

278
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:45,845
It's no use.
This cat has long, noisy nails.

279
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:46,837
Anyway...

280
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:50,477
I’ll call Dewey's office tomorrow
and request a proper interview.

281
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:52,683
-It might better suit his vanity.
-Thank you.

282
00:18:52,847 --> 00:18:55,077
-Meanwhile, let's start talking...
-Thank you. Thank you.

283
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:56,362
Thank you.

284
00:18:56,527 --> 00:18:58,722
In the meantime,
let’s start talking to people.

285
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,684
We don't need his blessing
for that.

286
00:19:00,847 --> 00:19:03,281
I think we should just speak
to people on the street.

287
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:07,565
Yes, in our nicest way, the way that
would most put people at ease...

288
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:08,876
Madam!

289
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:13,760
May we ask you about the gruesome
murders out at the Clutter home?

290
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:23,126
Maybe you should drop the word
''gruesome.''

291
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:28,116
Sir!

292
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:29,641
Sir!

293
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:33,519
Excuse me, sir.

294
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:38,397
We'd like to talk to you about the
tragic events of November 15th.

295
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:40,086
Sorry, ladies.

296
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:45,805
Do you think everyone keeps
calling me ''lady'' to be mean,

297
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:48,242
or can they honestly not tell?

298
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:53,278
I know I'm not Charles Atlas, but
even Ethel Merman doesn't have this.

299
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:55,438
No. Hers is thicker.

300
00:20:02,807 --> 00:20:04,286
Mr. Capote.

301
00:20:06,927 --> 00:20:09,077
Is this all?
No messages?

302
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:11,036
No, sir.

303
00:20:12,007 --> 00:20:16,364
I simply don't understand why
Alvin Dewey won't return my calls.

304
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:18,916
I've telephoned three times.

305
00:20:28,007 --> 00:20:29,235
Nelle.

306
00:20:29,407 --> 00:20:31,637
Care package from Babe.

307
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:33,718
It's beluga!

308
00:20:36,847 --> 00:20:39,407
Let's get some Ritz crackers
and eat it right now.

309
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:42,639
Let's. And you know what I think
you should do tomorrow?

310
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:44,684
Go see the Clutter place.

311
00:20:44,847 --> 00:20:48,999
Honey, if Alvin Dewey won't return
my calls, I’ll never see the house.

312
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:51,761
You know everybody on the planet.
Call somebody.

313
00:20:52,847 --> 00:20:56,999
And please tell the Duke and Duchess
I am sick to miss the dance.

314
00:20:57,927 --> 00:20:59,360
I will.

315
00:20:59,607 --> 00:21:03,236
Bennett hears wonderful things
about your book.

316
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,843
Well, I almost don't care
what the critics say

317
00:21:06,007 --> 00:21:08,282
as long as I can be allowed
to write another.

318
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:12,998
Your dream of being the Jane Austen
of Alabama will come true.

319
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:16,285
Anyway, Bennett knows the head
of Kansas University,

320
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:18,881
who knows the Clutters' lawyer.

321
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:46,839
The killers came in this way.

322
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:33,640
Any messages?

323
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:37,958
Princess Margaret

324
00:23:38,527 --> 00:23:40,518
and Noël Coward.

325
00:23:43,087 --> 00:23:45,317
No Dewey. Again.

326
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,844
They're in both ways over there.

327
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:51,965
Right, but this particular form
goes under last name.

328
00:23:52,127 --> 00:23:54,595
-That whole stack?
-That's the one, yeah.

329
00:23:55,247 --> 00:24:03,404
Is this a good time?

330
00:24:03,887 --> 00:24:06,037
Yeah. Come on in.

331
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:10,962
Ma'am...

332
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:14,284
What can I do for you folks?

333
00:24:14,447 --> 00:24:15,436
Well...

334
00:24:16,407 --> 00:24:20,400
you can begin by serving me
a large slice of humble pie.

335
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:24,243
I've come to apologize for acting
too big for my britches.

336
00:24:24,527 --> 00:24:27,405
As you see,
I even got new britches.

337
00:24:28,127 --> 00:24:30,561
Yeah, well, no harm done.
Real nice of you.

338
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:34,122
I wanted to explain myself.

339
00:24:34,287 --> 00:24:36,926
I'm trying to create
a new kind of reportage.

340
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:39,601
Have you read my book
''The Muses are Heard?''

341
00:24:42,007 --> 00:24:44,282
Well, it was very well received.

342
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:49,157
It's about an American opera company
in Moscow doing ''Porgy and Bess.''

343
00:24:49,327 --> 00:24:53,684
Now, if I relied only on what
the press managers told me,

344
00:24:53,847 --> 00:24:57,157
it would have been no different
than a newspaper article.

345
00:24:57,327 --> 00:25:02,003
But I gave it the emotional
and psychological detail of a novel.

346
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:05,599
I see, so you're doing something
different than a regular reporter.

347
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:06,836
Yes.

348
00:25:07,647 --> 00:25:09,956
And I can't really know how people
feel without your help.

349
00:25:10,127 --> 00:25:12,800
Oh, well, I can tell you
how they feel. Terrible.

350
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:14,923
They'll feel better
when this is solved.

351
00:25:15,087 --> 00:25:16,520
Yes, I agree, of course.
And that's...

352
00:25:16,687 --> 00:25:20,521
Look, I wish you well
with your project. But no access.

353
00:25:22,447 --> 00:25:26,122
I'm sorry, but Nelle and I will have
to stay for Christmas.

354
00:25:27,247 --> 00:25:28,441
Why?

355
00:25:28,607 --> 00:25:31,246
Because no one will talk to me.

356
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:35,719
I've got to stay until they forget
about me and can open up.

357
00:25:35,887 --> 00:25:38,117
No one forgets about you.

358
00:25:38,527 --> 00:25:40,358
What will you do for Christmas?

359
00:25:40,527 --> 00:25:42,995
Of course,
everything will be closed,

360
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:47,080
so I thought before I'd got to
the market and get a nice cheese,

361
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:48,566
some ham and olives.

362
00:25:48,727 --> 00:25:51,525
Slim sent a wonderful Burgundy.

363
00:25:51,687 --> 00:25:54,440
Nelle and I can make a picnic
at the hotel.

364
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:02,646
Excuse me?

365
00:26:03,287 --> 00:26:05,755
Could this be all the cheese?

366
00:26:05,927 --> 00:26:07,406
Well, how much do you need?

367
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:11,003
Mine is a matter of quality,
dear, not quantity.

368
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:15,558
Oh, you mean other types of cheese.
Goodness, no. Not here.

369
00:26:18,247 --> 00:26:20,044
Are you staying for Christmas?

370
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:21,959
Yes, we are.

371
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:24,925
Well, what will you and Mrs. Capote
do for your Christmas supper?

372
00:26:25,087 --> 00:26:29,797
If this is the only cheese I find,
Mrs. Capote and I might try cyanide.

373
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:33,967
Would you like to come to our house
for Christmas supper?

374
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:36,243
Really? Like for a party?

375
00:26:36,407 --> 00:26:39,285
Well, it's just not right you don't
have Christmas supper in a home.

376
00:26:39,447 --> 00:26:41,483
That is so kind of you.

377
00:26:41,647 --> 00:26:44,525
Nelle will be thrilled.
May I ask your name?

378
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:55,802
Hi.

379
00:26:56,967 --> 00:26:58,036
Hi.

380
00:27:00,407 --> 00:27:01,396
What?

381
00:27:01,807 --> 00:27:05,322
We are spending Christmas
with the Deweys.

382
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,440
This just isn't right.

383
00:27:12,607 --> 00:27:16,236
What isn't right is for two people
to spend Christmas alone.

384
00:27:16,407 --> 00:27:18,523
If there's two of them,
they won't be alone.

385
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:20,720
Hi. We're here.

386
00:27:20,887 --> 00:27:23,401
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

387
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:26,278
I know you said
not to bring anything,

388
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:30,122
but my daddy would kill me if I
showed up for company empty-handed.

389
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:31,686
We brought you a fruitcake.

390
00:27:31,847 --> 00:27:33,883
And she doesn't mean me.

391
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,559
My wife, Delores.

392
00:27:37,727 --> 00:27:39,558
-Truman.
-Foxy.

393
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:41,479
-Thank you.
-My wife, Delores.

394
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,121
Hello, Paul.

395
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:57,320
You gonna watch the game?

396
00:27:57,807 --> 00:27:59,798
I got 25 dollars on it.

397
00:28:04,647 --> 00:28:06,205
Truman, you like football?

398
00:28:07,327 --> 00:28:08,840
Not much.

399
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:12,518
Though I must admit it always sends
shivers up my spine

400
00:28:12,687 --> 00:28:15,997
when the men get inside
that little huddle and whisper.

401
00:28:27,127 --> 00:28:28,196
We have treats.

402
00:28:29,047 --> 00:28:31,481
I have kind of a party question.

403
00:28:31,927 --> 00:28:34,361
I hope it's not too awful or mean.

404
00:28:34,527 --> 00:28:36,358
That sounds fun. Let's play.

405
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:39,325
Paul Dewey. Don't you wanna come
in here and sit with the grownups?

406
00:28:39,487 --> 00:28:40,442
Since it's Christmas,

407
00:28:40,607 --> 00:28:43,360
I thought we could all
take turns telling

408
00:28:43,527 --> 00:28:46,917
what is the worst present
you ever got.

409
00:28:48,207 --> 00:28:52,837
Mine was a shawl from an elderly
neighbor lady. I'm no shawl lover.

410
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:54,963
-Me neither.
-They're never warm enough.

411
00:28:55,127 --> 00:28:57,800
Are my ears working properly?

412
00:28:57,967 --> 00:29:00,959
Am I the only one here
who loves shawls?

413
00:29:03,487 --> 00:29:05,045
Don't look at me.

414
00:29:05,207 --> 00:29:07,641
My goodness, I love shawls.

415
00:29:07,807 --> 00:29:09,525
I have several.

416
00:29:09,687 --> 00:29:12,565
I think the prettiest one
is the one Jennifer Jones gave me.

417
00:29:13,327 --> 00:29:16,046
Jennifer Jones?
The movie star?

418
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:20,200
Yes. We were in Rome making
a picture called ''Beat the Devil''

419
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:23,006
and I was struggling
to write a scene for Bogie

420
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:26,284
when I began to feel
the most inhuman pain.

421
00:29:26,447 --> 00:29:28,278
Bogie?
You mean Humphrey Bogart?

422
00:29:28,927 --> 00:29:32,363
I mean Mr. Lauren Bacall, yes.

423
00:29:32,527 --> 00:29:35,166
I was trying to write a scene for
him and Peter in which they both...

424
00:29:35,327 --> 00:29:37,158
Wait a minute.
Who's Peter?

425
00:29:37,327 --> 00:29:38,726
Peter Lorre.

426
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:43,716
But I had a terrible impacted tooth,
and so John...

427
00:29:43,887 --> 00:29:45,115
-Wayne?
-Garfield?

428
00:29:45,287 --> 00:29:46,322
Kennedy?

429
00:29:46,487 --> 00:29:47,886
Huston.

430
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:50,277
John Huston, the director?

431
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:58,120
John told me he didn't care
if we had to shut the movie down,

432
00:29:58,287 --> 00:30:00,517
I was going to the hospital.

433
00:30:01,327 --> 00:30:02,601
So I thought,

434
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:07,397
''Well, if I have to be in a Roman
hospital for who knows how long,

435
00:30:07,567 --> 00:30:11,401
I may as well have something with me
to make me feel good.''

436
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:15,845
So I wore the beautiful Balmain
shawl that Jennifer gave me

437
00:30:16,007 --> 00:30:18,043
and, if I do say so myself,

438
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:21,677
I felt and looked dreamy.

439
00:30:28,207 --> 00:30:29,845
Did you meet Humphrey Bogart?

440
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:31,156
Meet?

441
00:30:31,327 --> 00:30:34,364
My dear, every night
we had drinks and dinner

442
00:30:34,527 --> 00:30:36,006
and once, poker.

443
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:40,443
You played poker with
Humphrey Bogart?

444
00:30:40,607 --> 00:30:42,165
I had a disadvantage in that

445
00:30:42,327 --> 00:30:45,125
I didn't know the game in the way
that Bogie or Frank did.

446
00:30:45,287 --> 00:30:46,003
Frank?

447
00:30:46,407 --> 00:30:47,635
Sinatra.

448
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:50,480
Experience had taught them things

449
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:53,844
a relative novice such as myself
may not know, like, well...

450
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:56,885
Did you know that three of a kind
beats a pair?

451
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:03,717
So, I did not defeat
Mr. Humphrey Bogart at cards,

452
00:31:03,887 --> 00:31:08,597
but you may be interested to know I
soundly beat him at something else.

453
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,238
Arm wrestling.

454
00:31:19,247 --> 00:31:20,680
Hold on now.

455
00:31:21,407 --> 00:31:23,967
You expect us to believe

456
00:31:24,127 --> 00:31:27,005
that you beat Humphrey Bogart
at arm wrestling?

457
00:31:31,727 --> 00:31:33,365
Twice.

458
00:31:40,847 --> 00:31:41,962
You're good.

459
00:31:42,127 --> 00:31:44,357
Good match, sir.
Thank you.

460
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:48,007
Hey, I just beat the guy
who could beat Humphrey Bogart.

461
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:50,317
Cool. You wanna come over
and see what I got?

462
00:31:50,487 --> 00:31:52,796
You didn't beat Humphrey Bogart,
did you?

463
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:59,239
You don't think I'd defeat your
child on a Christmas afternoon

464
00:31:59,407 --> 00:32:01,967
with everyone here thinking
what they do about me?

465
00:32:02,807 --> 00:32:05,685
That would be a gift
of switches and ash.

466
00:32:08,287 --> 00:32:11,199
But you didn't beat
Humphrey Bogart, did you?

467
00:32:12,007 --> 00:32:14,726
AII right. Roll up your sleeve.

468
00:32:14,887 --> 00:32:16,400
No, no.

469
00:32:17,047 --> 00:32:18,446
Scared?

470
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:34,765
Well, I’ll be.

471
00:32:35,647 --> 00:32:38,923
Listen, Foxy. Whey you're tiny
you have to be tough.

472
00:32:39,447 --> 00:32:42,439
This world isn't kind
to little things.

473
00:33:14,407 --> 00:33:16,045
So glad you could make it.

474
00:33:16,207 --> 00:33:18,926
-Hope you'll come back. Thank you.
-Thank you. Merry Christmas.

475
00:33:19,087 --> 00:33:21,396
-Merry Christmas. Good night.
-Come on.

476
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:22,682
Bye-bye.

477
00:33:22,847 --> 00:33:25,486
Foxy, check under the tree.

478
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:26,524
Hello?

479
00:33:28,487 --> 00:33:30,876
No, they just left.

480
00:33:31,047 --> 00:33:34,756
Well, I know it, but the time flew.
Guess what...

481
00:33:34,927 --> 00:33:37,043
He knows Ava Gardner.

482
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:39,683
And Humphrey Bogart.

483
00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:43,237
And Betty Bacall.
That's Lauren Bacall.

484
00:33:45,247 --> 00:33:49,320
And she got right into the kitchen
and helped. They are so sweet.

485
00:33:56,447 --> 00:33:57,960
Anything good?

486
00:33:58,127 --> 00:34:00,516
Merry Christmas
from the Queen Mother.

487
00:34:00,687 --> 00:34:02,359
She loves me.

488
00:34:03,687 --> 00:34:04,915
Babe.

489
00:34:05,447 --> 00:34:06,641
Slim.

490
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:10,841
Who's this?

491
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:14,124
''Mrs. John Stimmell called to invite
you and your friend to dinner.''

492
00:34:14,287 --> 00:34:15,561
Who's that?

493
00:34:15,727 --> 00:34:17,843
It says she's a friend
of the Deweys.

494
00:34:18,287 --> 00:34:19,436
How nice.

495
00:34:19,607 --> 00:34:20,881
Look, here's another.

496
00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:24,676
''Please call Mrs. Dorn about dinner.
Friend of the Deweys.''

497
00:34:25,727 --> 00:34:27,524
Well, that sounds lovely.

498
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,195
Nelle.

499
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:33,955
These are all invitations!

500
00:34:38,487 --> 00:34:39,715
Then Ava said,

501
00:34:39,887 --> 00:34:44,199
''I'm not afraid of the police.
It's Frank who scares me!''

502
00:34:45,087 --> 00:34:48,716
And Marilyn said,
''Better sorry than safe.''

503
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:52,199
Marilyn Monroe.

504
00:34:52,647 --> 00:34:55,559
Bonnie Clutter
is such a dear and I...

505
00:34:58,127 --> 00:35:00,038
Was such a dear.

506
00:35:00,207 --> 00:35:01,686
Oh, goodness.

507
00:35:02,047 --> 00:35:05,164
It's hard to put a friend
in the past tense.

508
00:35:05,967 --> 00:35:10,677
It seems so sad, especially since
Bonnie wasn't well at the time.

509
00:35:11,807 --> 00:35:13,479
What was the matter?

510
00:35:15,087 --> 00:35:17,043
Oh, well, I shouldn't say.

511
00:35:17,207 --> 00:35:21,325
I just don't think she liked
to be with folks so much.

512
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:25,562
But if you ever did see her,
if you ever did,

513
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:28,924
she was always good old Bonnie.

514
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:32,006
She was going through
the change of life.

515
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:33,520
That's all?

516
00:35:33,687 --> 00:35:36,155
You try it. It's enough.

517
00:35:39,527 --> 00:35:43,486
Well, there were four of us
went to the house to clean up...

518
00:35:44,927 --> 00:35:46,042
clean up...

519
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:52,035
all the damage and the mess.

520
00:35:54,047 --> 00:35:57,039
We used to go out to Herb's
to hunt pheasant.

521
00:35:58,887 --> 00:36:02,800
It was strange driving out there
knowing what was waiting for us.

522
00:36:03,927 --> 00:36:05,918
The couch where the boy had been...

523
00:36:06,087 --> 00:36:09,796
I was just, I mean
the bodies were gone, but...

524
00:36:11,727 --> 00:36:14,082
Good Lord, just seeing that couch.

525
00:36:15,087 --> 00:36:18,318
Or the mattress box
where Herb had been.

526
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:21,723
There was so much blood...

527
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:25,481
There was so much blood....

528
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:29,926
Sometimes, in big, wide pools.
Sometimes in little splatters.

529
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:31,998
I was going up the stairs

530
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:34,920
and then I saw a big spot
on the banister...

531
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:37,560
and I almost...

532
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:39,640
I swear...

533
00:36:40,847 --> 00:36:44,157
That was worse than the big stuff
on the floor. Because I thought,

534
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,477
''It made it all the way up here?''

535
00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:51,647
I can only say I was a Marine

536
00:36:52,047 --> 00:36:54,515
and nothing ever got to me
the way this did.

537
00:36:57,127 --> 00:37:00,517
Herb was one of the most respected
ranchers in this state.

538
00:37:00,687 --> 00:37:03,724
If there was a list that told you
how to succeed with honor,

539
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:06,037
well, he just did
everything on it.

540
00:37:06,447 --> 00:37:09,883
You see, he worked hard,
he took care of his family

541
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:14,121
and when he went to church, he just
didn't get his time card punched.

542
00:37:14,287 --> 00:37:16,517
No, he went in and he listened.

543
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:21,883
And I've always believed that
whenever you do something right

544
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:24,277
it gives you a little bit of weight

545
00:37:24,447 --> 00:37:29,157
so that you come to feel rooted to
this earth, you know? Solid. Secure.

546
00:37:31,327 --> 00:37:33,682
Now what scares me is that...

547
00:37:34,447 --> 00:37:37,644
well, sometimes, out of nowhere,

548
00:37:37,887 --> 00:37:40,037
a bad wind blows up.

549
00:37:40,847 --> 00:37:45,557
Now it could be cancer,
could be drink,

550
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:50,041
could be some woman
that don't belong to you.

551
00:37:51,087 --> 00:37:54,557
And despite the weight
that's holding you to the ground,

552
00:37:55,047 --> 00:37:59,757
when that wind comes,
it picks you up light as a leaf

553
00:38:01,727 --> 00:38:04,161
and it takes you where it wants.

554
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,887
We're in control until we're not.

555
00:38:10,927 --> 00:38:12,599
Then we're helpless.

556
00:38:17,127 --> 00:38:21,245
''If you ever saw her,
she was always good old Bonnie.''

557
00:38:21,407 --> 00:38:25,116
No, no. She said, ''If you ever did
see her, if you ever did, she...''

558
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:26,117
That's right.

559
00:38:26,287 --> 00:38:28,357
''...she was always good old Bonnie.''

560
00:38:28,527 --> 00:38:29,482
Good ear.

561
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:33,562
Drink?

562
00:38:35,527 --> 00:38:38,246
Well, obviously the mother
wasn't right.

563
00:38:38,727 --> 00:38:41,924
I don't know.
It just sounds like menopause.

564
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:46,080
I hope not. That's a little grubby
for my novel.

565
00:38:46,247 --> 00:38:47,646
Your novel?

566
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:49,965
What are you talking about?

567
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:53,798
I think this story
is bigger than an article.

568
00:38:54,127 --> 00:38:55,446
I think it's a book.

569
00:38:55,607 --> 00:38:58,440
I can see that.
But non-fiction, right?

570
00:38:58,607 --> 00:39:00,757
Yes, of course
it will all be true, but...

571
00:39:00,927 --> 00:39:03,441
But what?
Either it is or it isn't.

572
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:04,676
You're not understanding.

573
00:39:04,847 --> 00:39:08,635
I wanna bring fictional techniques
to a non-fiction story.

574
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:11,924
What fictional techniques?
The ones where you make stuff up?

575
00:39:12,087 --> 00:39:16,319
If I were gonna make stuff up do you
think I'd take all these notes?

576
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,921
Well, you obviously plan
to turn Bonnie Clutter

577
00:39:19,087 --> 00:39:22,318
into some faux poetic recluse
when what it sounds like is

578
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:24,796
that she was just thrown off
by her menopause.

579
00:39:24,967 --> 00:39:26,480
What is your stupid fucking point?

580
00:39:26,647 --> 00:39:29,286
That you shouldn’t be doing
what you're doing.

581
00:39:29,807 --> 00:39:31,160
The truth is enough.

582
00:39:31,807 --> 00:39:35,083
I must say I don't appreciate
this lecture from you of all people.

583
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:38,523
''Mockingbird'' was based on true
things and you sure improved that.

584
00:39:38,687 --> 00:39:40,598
Right. It's a novel.

585
00:39:41,247 --> 00:39:44,557
Reportage means re-creating,
not creating.

586
00:39:44,727 --> 00:39:47,560
This is a new kind of reportage.

587
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:49,766
I’ll say.

588
00:40:10,607 --> 00:40:13,075
Okay. ''But if you ever did see her,
if you ever...''

589
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:14,123
I remember.

590
00:40:14,447 --> 00:40:15,482
Fine.

591
00:40:17,807 --> 00:40:18,922
It's your book.

592
00:40:19,087 --> 00:40:20,202
Yes.

593
00:40:20,487 --> 00:40:22,125
My seventh.

594
00:40:28,847 --> 00:40:29,962
Okay.

595
00:40:30,487 --> 00:40:31,636
How's your book coming?

596
00:40:32,047 --> 00:40:34,880
It'll take me a long time
to shape, but...

597
00:40:35,047 --> 00:40:37,686
thanks to Nelle,
who's been a gift from heaven,

598
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:39,480
and you all,

599
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:41,603
we'll probably only need
a week more here.

600
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:43,803
Well, I'm gonna miss
your Kansas steaks.

601
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:45,764
We'll be sorry to see you go.

602
00:40:45,927 --> 00:40:50,125
Is there any news? You know
I can't give you special access.

603
00:40:50,287 --> 00:40:51,356
We got them.

604
00:40:51,647 --> 00:40:52,443
What?

605
00:40:52,607 --> 00:40:53,437
What?

606
00:40:53,607 --> 00:40:55,643
We caught them. Just like you said,
there were two of them.

607
00:40:55,807 --> 00:40:58,685
The killers?
We caught the killers?

608
00:40:58,847 --> 00:41:00,917
Who are they? Are they down
in the jail right now?

609
00:41:01,087 --> 00:41:03,203
They're in Las Vegas.
I got to get right out there.

610
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:05,039
Can I come?
Oh, please, Foxy!

611
00:41:05,207 --> 00:41:06,037
Not this time, partner.

612
00:41:06,207 --> 00:41:09,324
Well, there isn't gonna be another.
How many times will you arrest them?

613
00:41:09,487 --> 00:41:10,556
I'm sorry.

614
00:41:11,527 --> 00:41:13,085
Honestly, Marie...

615
00:41:13,487 --> 00:41:16,365
How can you stay married
to such a mule?

616
00:41:17,407 --> 00:41:19,967
Maybe now you’ll get
a whole night's sleep.

617
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:32,355
Congratulations, foxy.

618
00:41:34,607 --> 00:41:36,996
This kind of changes your book.

619
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:38,805
You're telling me.

620
00:41:39,607 --> 00:41:42,201
Of course, if I thought it was hard
getting the townspeople to open up,

621
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:45,404
how in heaven's name will I ever get
the killers to talk?

622
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:47,000
Look, look. They're here.

623
00:42:12,007 --> 00:42:14,885
Pardon me. Pardon me.
Excuse me.

624
00:42:22,287 --> 00:42:24,437
I can't see the other one.

625
00:42:25,767 --> 00:42:27,166
There he is.

626
00:42:43,007 --> 00:42:45,885
No way.
The press inside the prison.

627
00:42:46,047 --> 00:42:48,117
I have many connections
in government.

628
00:42:48,287 --> 00:42:51,324
Perhaps I could have someone call,
explain what I'm doing.

629
00:42:51,487 --> 00:42:54,445
You'd pretty much have to know
the President of the United States

630
00:42:54,607 --> 00:42:56,837
before I'd let you visit
these boys.

631
00:43:01,527 --> 00:43:03,757
Suck my cock, you cocksucker!

632
00:43:03,927 --> 00:43:05,076
I never snack.

633
00:43:05,247 --> 00:43:06,919
You want to kiss my asshole,
bitch?

634
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:09,157
I'd prefer it to your face.

635
00:43:10,407 --> 00:43:12,841
You want to write a book about me?

636
00:43:13,487 --> 00:43:17,162
If my jackass teachers
could hear you say that!

637
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:18,920
Did you ever write a book?

638
00:43:19,087 --> 00:43:20,156
Certainly.

639
00:43:20,327 --> 00:43:24,115
My first novel, ''Other Voices,
Other Rooms'' was heralded by critics

640
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,881
as the most exciting
literary debut since...

641
00:43:27,047 --> 00:43:28,480
Yeah, okay.

642
00:43:29,047 --> 00:43:30,400
You a queer?

643
00:43:30,767 --> 00:43:31,677
Yes.

644
00:43:31,847 --> 00:43:33,326
Because I'd let you suck me.

645
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:36,479
I'm not a queer, but letting you
suck my dick doesn't make me queer.

646
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,126
It makes you a queer.

647
00:43:38,287 --> 00:43:40,243
A mouth's a mouth.

648
00:43:42,007 --> 00:43:44,077
Well, thanks, I guess...

649
00:43:44,327 --> 00:43:46,045
but no.

650
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,959
So then what's in it for me?

651
00:43:48,287 --> 00:43:49,561
Money.

652
00:43:50,247 --> 00:43:53,478
I'd give you a share
of my royalties.

653
00:44:01,207 --> 00:44:03,960
I got two kids
by my first marriage.

654
00:44:05,087 --> 00:44:07,920
Maybe I can give the money
to Lacy, my ex.

655
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:09,885
Would you help. me
write her a letter?

656
00:44:11,487 --> 00:44:13,205
I'd be glad to.

657
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:16,520
Okay, I’ll do it.

658
00:44:16,727 --> 00:44:18,365
The Clutter deal was my idea.

659
00:44:18,527 --> 00:44:21,439
I shared a cell with a piece
of rat shit called Floyd Wells

660
00:44:21,607 --> 00:44:25,395
who told me the old man Clutter
had a safe with 10,000 dollars.

661
00:44:26,727 --> 00:44:30,515
Dick says you first heard about
the Clutter safe from his cell mate,

662
00:44:30,687 --> 00:44:32,200
Floyd Wells.

663
00:44:34,447 --> 00:44:36,039
Is that right?

664
00:44:36,287 --> 00:44:38,039
Well, he told you, didn't he?

665
00:44:38,847 --> 00:44:40,678
Yes, but can I trust him?

666
00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:43,646
He's in jail.

667
00:44:44,727 --> 00:44:46,445
I wouldn't trust him.

668
00:44:48,287 --> 00:44:52,917
You don't want the only perception
people have of you coming from Dick.

669
00:44:53,167 --> 00:44:55,203
I can help. get your side out.

670
00:44:55,367 --> 00:44:57,164
Don't bullshit me.

671
00:44:58,127 --> 00:45:01,756
You don't care about my side.
You're not trying to help. me.

672
00:45:02,287 --> 00:45:03,959
Well, this would be helpful.

673
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:07,637
You'd be entitled to a share
of the royalties.

674
00:45:07,807 --> 00:45:10,924
And what would I do
with royalties in here?

675
00:45:11,087 --> 00:45:12,839
You might get out,
and you could use...

676
00:45:13,007 --> 00:45:14,156
We're not getting out!

677
00:45:16,887 --> 00:45:19,845
I said no bullshit
and you gave me more bullshit.

678
00:45:23,247 --> 00:45:24,600
Go away.

679
00:45:25,967 --> 00:45:27,764
He'll loosen up.

680
00:45:27,927 --> 00:45:29,076
How's Dick?

681
00:45:29,247 --> 00:45:30,202
Dick?

682
00:45:30,487 --> 00:45:33,001
He just goes on and on and on.

683
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:37,160
Perry probably shot the Clutters
just to get Dick to be quiet.

684
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:40,604
I have to have both sides.

685
00:45:41,407 --> 00:45:44,558
How do you get your New York lady
friends to tell you everything?

686
00:45:44,727 --> 00:45:46,126
My swans?

687
00:45:46,767 --> 00:45:48,917
I figure out what they need.

688
00:45:49,087 --> 00:45:52,602
Gossip. Comfort.
And I give it to them.

689
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:57,604
So find out what Perry needs. In the
meantime, get all you can from Dick.

690
00:45:57,767 --> 00:46:00,235
Surely he’ll shed
some light on Perry.

691
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:02,997
The man and the boy
we took in the basement.

692
00:46:03,167 --> 00:46:04,725
Now, here's something.

693
00:46:05,247 --> 00:46:09,877
When I wanted to enjoy myself on the
girl, you know, knock her box out,

694
00:46:10,127 --> 00:46:12,357
Perry says for me
not to touch her.

695
00:46:12,647 --> 00:46:17,357
But when he's tying up that boy,
he put a pillow under his head.

696
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:21,000
And told the old man
to lay on a mattress box

697
00:46:21,167 --> 00:46:23,397
because he said the floor was cold.

698
00:46:23,807 --> 00:46:26,002
Too cold to get shot on?

699
00:46:26,447 --> 00:46:28,039
Why do you think he did that?

700
00:46:29,247 --> 00:46:33,957
And I said, ''You losing your nerve?
We can't leave no witnesses.''

701
00:46:36,487 --> 00:46:39,797
And he said no but I thought,
''Are you a faggot?''

702
00:46:40,447 --> 00:46:44,679
Putting that pillow for the boy,
telling me not to crack the girl...

703
00:46:47,007 --> 00:46:49,077
But other times he's okay.

704
00:46:50,687 --> 00:46:54,123
Didn't seem like a faggot when he
splattered their hair on the wall.

705
00:46:57,727 --> 00:46:59,558
No, we didn't want to kill them.

706
00:46:59,727 --> 00:47:02,605
We wanted to get in and out
without a trace.

707
00:47:03,047 --> 00:47:05,515
Perry wanted us to get stockings
for our faces.

708
00:47:05,967 --> 00:47:09,243
But that shit-ass store where we got
the gloves only had light ones.

709
00:47:09,407 --> 00:47:12,922
You could see my eyes through them.
Pick me out of a lineup.

710
00:47:13,087 --> 00:47:17,603
So Perry says to go to the hospital
and buy black ones off the nuns.

711
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:19,997
And I thought that was
a damn crazy idea,

712
00:47:20,167 --> 00:47:22,078
but I didn't feel like
fighting with him,

713
00:47:22,247 --> 00:47:25,080
so I went and huddle behind
the door, and I came out and said,

714
00:47:25,247 --> 00:47:27,556
''Catholic bitches
wouldn’t sell me none.''

715
00:47:28,367 --> 00:47:30,323
And what did Perry say?

716
00:47:30,687 --> 00:47:32,120
He said,

717
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:33,916
''Any''.

718
00:47:34,527 --> 00:47:36,757
''Catholic bitches
wouldn’t sell you any.''

719
00:47:36,927 --> 00:47:37,962
Really?

720
00:47:38,927 --> 00:47:40,326
He corrected your grammar?

721
00:47:40,487 --> 00:47:41,920
Listen, sugar.

722
00:47:43,407 --> 00:47:44,999
Perry Smith....

723
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:48,320
fancies himself an artiste.

724
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:57,876
Hey, baby. You wanna suck my dick
through the bars?

725
00:47:58,527 --> 00:48:01,246
Yours couldn't reach
through the bars.

726
00:48:03,727 --> 00:48:07,481
The only way to deal with vulgarity
is to rise above it.

727
00:48:09,247 --> 00:48:13,399
I had a similar experience
with my friend, Tennessee Williams.

728
00:48:13,887 --> 00:48:16,037
The artist and intellectual?

729
00:48:18,407 --> 00:48:19,920
Never mind.

730
00:48:20,287 --> 00:48:23,006
Nobody here likes
this kind of thing.

731
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:25,676
I do.

732
00:48:28,607 --> 00:48:30,120
I'd like to hear it.

733
00:48:34,247 --> 00:48:36,920
Well, Tennessee and I were
in this bar once...

734
00:48:37,087 --> 00:48:40,124
when this very drunk woman
came up to me and said,

735
00:48:40,287 --> 00:48:43,962
''May I have your autograph?''
I said, ''Why, yes, dear.''

736
00:48:44,407 --> 00:48:47,160
She said she didn't have
a piece of paper.

737
00:48:47,327 --> 00:48:50,205
So she pulled up her skirt,
pointed to her belly button

738
00:48:50,367 --> 00:48:52,278
and asked me to autograph that.

739
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:55,961
So then she hands me
an eyebrow pencil

740
00:48:56,607 --> 00:49:00,202
and I write my name all the way
around her navel like a sundial.

741
00:49:00,367 --> 00:49:05,077
All of the sudden appears her angry
and very drunk husband who says,

742
00:49:05,967 --> 00:49:10,677
''Since you're in the mood to sign
things, why don't you sign this?''

743
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:15,318
And with that, he unzipped his fly
and hauled out his manhood.

744
00:49:15,487 --> 00:49:16,761
Well, what'd you do?

745
00:49:17,247 --> 00:49:19,807
Well, the room was
graveyard silent.

746
00:49:20,447 --> 00:49:24,122
I looked him up and down and said,
calm as I could,

747
00:49:25,047 --> 00:49:28,403
''Well, I don't know
if I could autograph it,

748
00:49:29,447 --> 00:49:31,438
but perhaps I could initial it.''

749
00:49:34,607 --> 00:49:38,361
What kind of stuff does
Tennessee Williams write?

750
00:49:38,847 --> 00:49:42,044
I know his name, I just can't think
what are his books.

751
00:49:42,207 --> 00:49:45,324
He's a dramatist. He wrote
''A Streetcar Named Desire.''

752
00:49:45,487 --> 00:49:47,523
-That Brando was in?
-The very same.

753
00:49:47,687 --> 00:49:50,565
Marlon Brando is the fucking king!

754
00:49:51,087 --> 00:49:53,282
Now, he's one of my two
favorite actors.

755
00:49:53,447 --> 00:49:54,436
Who's the other?

756
00:49:54,607 --> 00:49:56,040
Humphrey Bogart.

757
00:50:12,287 --> 00:50:13,879
I beat Humphrey Bogart.

758
00:50:14,047 --> 00:50:15,878
And Alvin Dewey, too.

759
00:50:17,687 --> 00:50:21,316
This is the most black-hearted thing
you've ever done, Nelle Harper Lee,

760
00:50:21,487 --> 00:50:23,284
and I will never forgive you.

761
00:50:23,447 --> 00:50:28,123
Hush your silliness. You're all
set now. Perry's ready to talk.

762
00:50:28,887 --> 00:50:30,559
I need my life. back.

763
00:50:30,807 --> 00:50:34,117
There are a few fires
I need to rekindle.

764
00:50:34,287 --> 00:50:35,640
Well, goodbye.

765
00:50:36,127 --> 00:50:37,242
I hate you.

766
00:50:37,407 --> 00:50:39,967
Thank you. You, too.

767
00:51:01,407 --> 00:51:03,284
How's the vanquisher of Bogart?

768
00:51:03,447 --> 00:51:04,436
Okay.

769
00:51:05,727 --> 00:51:07,160
Tell me more about him.

770
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:12,240
Well, I think we should talk
about some other things first.

771
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:13,482
Like what?

772
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:18,438
Nothing. I just don't have
a lot more about Bogie.

773
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:26,678
I do have a very amusing story
about Marlon Brando.

774
00:51:27,527 --> 00:51:31,281
I once spent an entire evening
with him, just the two of us,

775
00:51:31,447 --> 00:51:35,838
and he told me all about his life.
before he became a star.

776
00:51:36,127 --> 00:51:37,480
Are you guys friends?

777
00:51:37,647 --> 00:51:41,435
Well, I wouldn’t say that. He's told
people he wants to kill me.

778
00:51:41,607 --> 00:51:42,517
What for?

779
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:47,043
He didn't like the way
I portrayed him in my article.

780
00:51:47,207 --> 00:51:50,597
He claims he told me certain things
off the record.

781
00:51:50,767 --> 00:51:52,758
Well, you couldn’t just
check your notes?

782
00:51:53,687 --> 00:51:55,484
I never take notes.

783
00:51:55,647 --> 00:52:00,357
I employ a memory technique
that gives me almost 100% retention.

784
00:52:00,527 --> 00:52:02,643
Well, ''almost''
is the key fucking word.

785
00:52:02,807 --> 00:52:04,923
I may miss a word,
but never a meaning.

786
00:52:05,087 --> 00:52:07,442
If you miss the right word,
you will.

787
00:52:08,767 --> 00:52:10,280
You've got a hell
of a fucking nerve.

788
00:52:10,447 --> 00:52:12,915
What are you trying to bother
a great actor like Brando for?

789
00:52:13,087 --> 00:52:13,963
You misunderst...

790
00:52:14,127 --> 00:52:16,322
See, this is why
I don't wanna talk to you.

791
00:52:16,487 --> 00:52:18,955
If you want to make me look like
some asshoIe, you will.

792
00:52:19,127 --> 00:52:21,357
Perry, I never judge my characters.

793
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:28,844
Well, here's something for you
to remember all 100% of.

794
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:32,445
I am not a character.

795
00:52:32,647 --> 00:52:34,956
I'm a human fucking being.

796
00:52:35,127 --> 00:52:36,037
Guard!

797
00:52:36,207 --> 00:52:40,917
Perry Edward Smith! I am writing
this book with or without you.

798
00:52:41,127 --> 00:52:44,961
You can get involved, so I can make
you a 3 dimensional human being,

799
00:52:45,127 --> 00:52:47,083
or you can continue
this foolishness

800
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:50,364
and I will head straight back
to New York and write what I want.

801
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:00,920
Is this my party?

802
00:53:01,087 --> 00:53:02,520
Truman!

803
00:53:02,687 --> 00:53:06,396
T-bone! Welcome home, my darling.
We missed you so much.

804
00:53:15,727 --> 00:53:18,525
I don't believe I ever said this.

805
00:53:18,687 --> 00:53:20,996
Tell us about the killers.

806
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:26,842
Well, their names are Dick Hickock
and Perry Smith.

807
00:53:27,007 --> 00:53:28,838
Have you met them?

808
00:53:29,007 --> 00:53:31,362
Met them? My dear,
I've been in their cells.

809
00:53:31,527 --> 00:53:32,721
I have goose flesh.

810
00:53:32,887 --> 00:53:36,357
When you're talking to them,
they seem like perfectly nice boys.

811
00:53:36,527 --> 00:53:40,725
To be frank, I'm much more concerned
for my safety around Norman Mailer.

812
00:53:44,127 --> 00:53:47,881
Dick speaks about what happened
without any sense that it was wrong.

813
00:53:48,047 --> 00:53:49,924
It was just something
that happened.

814
00:53:50,087 --> 00:53:51,156
What about Terry?

815
00:53:51,567 --> 00:53:52,716
No, it's Perry.

816
00:53:53,007 --> 00:53:54,360
As in Antoinette.

817
00:53:55,087 --> 00:53:56,486
He's an enigma.

818
00:53:57,047 --> 00:54:00,596
Before he killed the Clutter boy,
he put a pillow under his head.

819
00:54:00,967 --> 00:54:03,242
And he wouldn’t let Dick
rape the girl.

820
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,362
He's not all kind.

821
00:54:04,607 --> 00:54:05,722
Jack's right.

822
00:54:05,887 --> 00:54:09,880
After these demonstrations of
gentility, he did shoot them dead.

823
00:54:10,127 --> 00:54:12,004
And cut the old man's throat.

824
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:13,486
There's something...

825
00:54:13,887 --> 00:54:16,606
I can't quite put my finger on it.

826
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:19,565
It seems insane to say
that he's tender,

827
00:54:20,407 --> 00:54:25,083
but he does have the tender and the
terrible side by side inside him.

828
00:54:27,967 --> 00:54:29,480
He's very...

829
00:54:39,647 --> 00:54:40,796
He's very?

830
00:54:47,327 --> 00:54:49,921
Never mind that.
Let's go around the table

831
00:54:50,087 --> 00:54:53,523
and you can all tell me
whom you're having affairs with.

832
00:54:54,607 --> 00:54:55,323
Oh, goody.

833
00:54:56,247 --> 00:54:57,316
Bennett?

834
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:04,125
In his letters,
Tru Heart always says:

835
00:55:04,887 --> 00:55:06,684
''What's the new thing
that everyone loves?''

836
00:55:06,847 --> 00:55:08,803
And, as any of us
with children know,

837
00:55:08,967 --> 00:55:13,006
the big new thing is not
on Broadway or even on CBS.

838
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:14,998
Sorry, darling.

839
00:55:15,447 --> 00:55:16,880
It's this.

840
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:21,359
You see your child with it at home,
''I simply have to slit my wrists.''

841
00:55:22,047 --> 00:55:23,480
And five minutes later...

842
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,682
you're doing it.

843
00:55:24,847 --> 00:55:28,442
Doors closed, of course,
but you just can't resist it.

844
00:55:28,607 --> 00:55:29,642
I did.

845
00:55:29,807 --> 00:55:32,037
Well, assholes aren't much
for dancing.

846
00:55:33,767 --> 00:55:34,882
Oh, dear.

847
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:38,962
How's your writing come, Jack?

848
00:55:41,007 --> 00:55:42,360
Well, let’s hear it.

849
00:55:42,527 --> 00:55:45,564
Well, when Babe told me
anyone could learn it,

850
00:55:45,727 --> 00:55:49,925
I bet her $100 she couldn’t teach me
and now I owe her $100.

851
00:55:51,887 --> 00:55:56,278
Slim and I will show you how,
and then you can jump right in.

852
00:55:56,447 --> 00:55:57,323
You, especially.

853
00:55:57,807 --> 00:55:58,842
Needle's on...

854
00:56:01,207 --> 00:56:02,765
Oh, my word.

855
00:56:07,327 --> 00:56:08,680
Come on, my protégé.

856
00:56:08,847 --> 00:56:09,802
All right, teacher.

857
00:56:13,247 --> 00:56:15,397
When she taught me, I said,
''What are the other steps?''

858
00:56:15,567 --> 00:56:17,239
She said,
''There are no other steps.''

859
00:56:18,527 --> 00:56:19,482
Who's next?

860
00:56:19,647 --> 00:56:21,080
Who else? Truman?

861
00:56:22,167 --> 00:56:22,963
Moi?

862
00:56:25,487 --> 00:56:26,840
No, how do I...

863
00:56:29,727 --> 00:56:31,763
That's what I said.
It's not a dance.

864
00:56:31,927 --> 00:56:33,155
You put the foot out.

865
00:56:33,327 --> 00:56:34,646
You put the foot out.

866
00:56:34,807 --> 00:56:35,762
Truman? Truman?

867
00:56:40,687 --> 00:56:41,915
You just put your foot out.

868
00:56:44,447 --> 00:56:46,119
What are you doing there?

869
00:56:46,927 --> 00:56:49,077
You're doing something
with your arms.

870
00:56:49,247 --> 00:56:50,680
Then we go down.

871
00:56:50,847 --> 00:56:52,803
Oh, my word.
What is that, Flamenco?

872
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:58,037
I'm so sorry about Jack. I almost
fainted when he insulted Bill.

873
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:02,043
Bill can take it, believe me.

874
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,880
Jack has a moral certainty
that's so oppressive.

875
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:06,765
Moral in what way?

876
00:57:07,567 --> 00:57:11,355
Just that anything fun
is a crime against my art,

877
00:57:11,687 --> 00:57:14,247
certainly not moral
in a personal way.

878
00:57:14,407 --> 00:57:17,285
We have an understanding
that if we need something sexual

879
00:57:17,447 --> 00:57:20,007
and the other isn't there
to provide it, that...

880
00:57:20,167 --> 00:57:21,805
I understand.

881
00:57:22,527 --> 00:57:25,200
I hardly ever wander,
but he does.

882
00:57:25,367 --> 00:57:29,326
We don't discuss it. I can allow it
more if I know less about it.

883
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:33,039
But doesn't even the idea
upset you?

884
00:57:33,647 --> 00:57:35,877
I mean, how can you bear
to think of...

885
00:57:36,407 --> 00:57:39,285
...or keep yourself
from picturing...?

886
00:57:41,967 --> 00:57:43,525
Honey, what is it?

887
00:57:46,167 --> 00:57:47,998
Bill is having an affair.

888
00:57:48,727 --> 00:57:50,240
Babaling, no...

889
00:57:50,407 --> 00:57:53,399
Please, you absolutely must not
breathe a word of this to anyone.

890
00:57:53,567 --> 00:57:55,523
It will die inside me.

891
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,206
How did you find out?

892
00:58:00,487 --> 00:58:03,001
Our bed sheets were stained.

893
00:58:03,447 --> 00:58:05,278
Okay, well, now I could vomit.

894
00:58:05,447 --> 00:58:07,961
And of course,
he couldn’t give it to the maid.

895
00:58:08,127 --> 00:58:08,798
Well, no.

896
00:58:08,967 --> 00:58:13,040
So he got on his hands and knees in
front of the tub and scrubbed them.

897
00:58:14,247 --> 00:58:15,965
But it didn't quite come out.

898
00:58:16,247 --> 00:58:19,842
And when I got back I noticed
this odd outline on the sheets.

899
00:58:20,007 --> 00:58:24,478
And I said, like a fool, I mean,
not even suspecting, I said...

900
00:58:26,567 --> 00:58:27,966
I said...

901
00:58:29,447 --> 00:58:31,358
''What on earth is that?''

902
00:58:31,727 --> 00:58:34,400
I thought Mary Lee
had bleached them.

903
00:58:35,087 --> 00:58:37,521
But then I looked at Bill
and there was that...

904
00:58:39,567 --> 00:58:43,526
that look on his face.
And I thought,

905
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:48,162
''Thanks heavens
he is such a bad liar

906
00:58:48,327 --> 00:58:51,319
or I would have been
most unjust to Mary Lee.''

907
00:58:52,007 --> 00:58:55,556
It doesn't seem possible that a man
who owns a television network

908
00:58:55,727 --> 00:58:57,479
can be such a bad liar.

909
00:58:57,647 --> 00:59:00,002
It seems so essential
to his success.

910
00:59:03,367 --> 00:59:05,039
What am I gonna do?

911
00:59:06,687 --> 00:59:09,599
You are going to call me
whenever you need me,

912
00:59:09,767 --> 00:59:13,362
even if it's 3 A.M. and Brooklyn
and Manhattan are at war.

913
00:59:13,527 --> 00:59:17,486
I’ll come over the Brooklyn Bridge
bullets flying

914
00:59:17,647 --> 00:59:20,764
to let you know you have
a lifelong friend in me.

915
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,565
T-bone, you are so dear.

916
00:59:25,167 --> 00:59:28,603
I can't picture Bill Paley
washing sheets!

917
00:59:28,767 --> 00:59:31,076
He must have been frantic.

918
00:59:31,927 --> 00:59:34,487
-Poor Babe.
-I know, I know. Bless her.

919
00:59:35,367 --> 00:59:36,561
Check.

920
00:59:37,927 --> 00:59:40,236
Will you come while I find
a newsstand?

921
00:59:40,407 --> 00:59:44,958
I'm trying make Perry like me
by sending them dirty magazines.

922
00:59:45,687 --> 00:59:46,915
Sure.

923
00:59:49,447 --> 00:59:53,565
I wish I'd find a man like you.
Sex and the money, I wouldn’t care,

924
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,683
if I'd always have fun like this.

925
00:59:55,847 --> 00:59:57,917
Thank you, Big Mama.
I love you.

926
00:59:58,087 --> 00:59:59,759
I love you, too.

927
00:59:59,927 --> 01:00:01,076
Do you?

928
01:00:01,247 --> 01:00:03,522
Well, how can you even ask?

929
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:05,484
You never confide in me.

930
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:07,399
No, I don't, darling.
You're right.

931
01:00:07,567 --> 01:00:08,556
Why don't you?

932
01:00:08,727 --> 01:00:11,321
It's very simple.
I can't trust you.

933
01:00:11,607 --> 01:00:13,757
What? I'm speechless.

934
01:00:14,407 --> 01:00:16,159
Paralyzed and speechless.

935
01:00:16,327 --> 01:00:17,282
Good afternoon.

936
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:21,281
I need two copies of Playboy,
Party Doll, Stag Night,

937
01:00:21,607 --> 01:00:25,919
Baby Doll, Hotsy Totsy, French Flip,
Pink Lace, Busty and Juggle.

938
01:00:26,567 --> 01:00:27,682
Jiggle.

939
01:00:27,847 --> 01:00:29,599
Why on earth can you not trust me?

940
01:00:29,767 --> 01:00:34,079
Well, you know why.
Because someday you’ll use it.

941
01:00:34,247 --> 01:00:36,078
That will never be true.

942
01:00:36,247 --> 01:00:39,683
I may not be a monk,
but I certainly have a moral code.

943
01:00:39,847 --> 01:00:41,280
Good heavens!

944
01:00:41,607 --> 01:00:43,996
Look at this!
This is revolting.

945
01:00:44,167 --> 01:00:47,284
Women look much better in clothes,
much, much, better.

946
01:00:47,447 --> 01:00:50,086
Goodness gracious,
look at this messy thing.

947
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:51,726
I'm glad to see you've recovered.

948
01:01:01,367 --> 01:01:02,959
How are things coming?

949
01:01:03,647 --> 01:01:06,719
I found a superb structure,
going back and forth

950
01:01:06,887 --> 01:01:10,084
between the Clutters
and Dick and Perry drawing near.

951
01:01:10,247 --> 01:01:14,399
But if I don't find emotional depth
it's just another police drama.

952
01:01:14,567 --> 01:01:15,841
Who needs it?

953
01:01:16,967 --> 01:01:19,356
Well, face it, without Perry,
you're dead.

954
01:01:19,887 --> 01:01:21,605
I'd cut your losses.

955
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,923
Nelle!

956
01:01:23,967 --> 01:01:25,241
Here's your mail.

957
01:01:26,847 --> 01:01:29,077
Something from The New Yorker.

958
01:01:31,047 --> 01:01:34,562
Something that looks like
invitations, and something...

959
01:01:35,527 --> 01:01:38,883
Do you know anyone
in the Kansas State Penitentiary?

960
01:01:40,687 --> 01:01:44,396
He must be writing to thank me
for that revolting pornography.

961
01:01:55,927 --> 01:01:57,679
Well, you won't believe this.

962
01:01:57,847 --> 01:01:58,802
What?

963
01:01:59,127 --> 01:02:02,164
Dear Mr. Capote,

964
01:02:02,567 --> 01:02:05,957
it was extremely solicitous of you
to send me those periodicals.

965
01:02:06,207 --> 01:02:08,118
He reads the dictionary.

966
01:02:08,287 --> 01:02:12,246
But I regret to inform you that
the reading material was repellent.

967
01:02:12,967 --> 01:02:14,798
My future will soon be determined.

968
01:02:14,967 --> 01:02:19,085
But there are only two outcomes:
life. in prison or death.

969
01:02:19,687 --> 01:02:23,316
So, whether I have a short time
remaining or a long time to come,

970
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:28,003
I owe it to my mind to fill it with
things of beauty and intelligence.

971
01:02:28,447 --> 01:02:30,199
And how about that handwriting?

972
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:34,159
Well, if you want beauty
and intelligence,

973
01:02:34,567 --> 01:02:36,080
you're his man.

974
01:02:46,047 --> 01:02:49,039
I waited so we could
open it together.

975
01:02:53,207 --> 01:02:56,643
Dear Mr. Capote.:
thank you for the reading material.

976
01:02:56,807 --> 01:03:00,322
It was much more intellectual than
the pussy pictures you sent before.

977
01:03:00,727 --> 01:03:01,682
However...

978
01:03:01,847 --> 01:03:03,121
However?

979
01:03:03,487 --> 01:03:05,159
Though the stories are told well,

980
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:07,438
I, ultimately, did not like them

981
01:03:07,607 --> 01:03:10,519
because I thought the writing
lacked kindness.

982
01:03:10,687 --> 01:03:12,325
I have never!

983
01:03:12,687 --> 01:03:15,326
Maybe you should go back
to sending him porn.

984
01:03:15,887 --> 01:03:20,597
Imagine being told your work lacked
kindness by a 4-time killer!

985
01:03:21,167 --> 01:03:25,126
My writing is dispassionate
and unsentimental,

986
01:03:25,287 --> 01:03:27,437
but I wouldn’t say it's unkind.

987
01:03:27,607 --> 01:03:30,758
I've never thought about it
in those terms exactly.

988
01:03:31,087 --> 01:03:32,759
What a thing to say.

989
01:03:32,927 --> 01:03:34,201
Yes.

990
01:03:44,967 --> 01:03:48,755
I came all this way back,
three days on the train,

991
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:51,681
because there's something
I want you to know.

992
01:03:52,967 --> 01:03:55,845
I have given my whole life.
to one effort,

993
01:03:56,007 --> 01:03:58,441
the creation of a great
work of art.

994
01:03:59,447 --> 01:04:01,483
Please, don't laugh at me.

995
01:04:02,647 --> 01:04:04,160
My whole life.,

996
01:04:05,207 --> 01:04:08,165
all I've wanted was
to create a work of art.

997
01:04:09,447 --> 01:04:11,836
I sang, nobody listened.

998
01:04:12,767 --> 01:04:15,679
I painted, nobody looked.

999
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:20,243
Now, Dick and me,
we murder four people.

1000
01:04:20,967 --> 01:04:22,798
And what's gonna come out of it?

1001
01:04:24,127 --> 01:04:25,685
A work of art.

1002
01:04:28,647 --> 01:04:30,239
I'm laughing at me.

1003
01:04:31,927 --> 01:04:35,602
You want me to open up, but I don't
think you can understand me.

1004
01:04:35,767 --> 01:04:36,961
Why not?

1005
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:38,719
It was your books.

1006
01:04:39,407 --> 01:04:43,082
I thought you looked down on
the people you were writing about,

1007
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:44,999
like you were sneering at them.

1008
01:04:45,447 --> 01:04:48,519
I would never sneer
at my characters.

1009
01:04:48,727 --> 01:04:50,877
If I'm gonna put my heart
in front of you,

1010
01:04:51,047 --> 01:04:54,483
I need to know I'm doing it
with someone who will listen to it

1011
01:04:54,767 --> 01:04:59,079
and not make a joke out of it
like you did with Holly Golightly.

1012
01:05:01,167 --> 01:05:03,283
You can't write my story

1013
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:06,884
because your idea of suffering
is so far from mine.

1014
01:05:07,047 --> 01:05:08,366
It's not.

1015
01:05:08,687 --> 01:05:10,166
I promise.

1016
01:05:13,327 --> 01:05:14,316
Goodbye.

1017
01:05:50,807 --> 01:05:52,206
Okay.

1018
01:05:55,047 --> 01:05:58,483
The reason this is hard for me
to say is that

1019
01:06:00,327 --> 01:06:02,636
I've never said it out loud before.

1020
01:06:04,167 --> 01:06:07,284
We told everyone
she was sick, but...

1021
01:06:13,327 --> 01:06:15,477
my mother committed suicide.

1022
01:06:17,767 --> 01:06:20,884
-Is this a trick?
-No!

1023
01:06:21,047 --> 01:06:22,400
-Are you bullshitting me?
-No!

1024
01:06:23,287 --> 01:06:25,164
Have you been talking to Dick?

1025
01:06:25,327 --> 01:06:26,282
No.

1026
01:06:31,047 --> 01:06:32,400
What happened?

1027
01:06:36,807 --> 01:06:38,160
Why'd she do it?

1028
01:06:41,367 --> 01:06:43,722
All my mother ever wanted

1029
01:06:44,127 --> 01:06:47,199
was to be a Park Avenue lady,

1030
01:06:49,807 --> 01:06:53,436
which isn't easy when you're
in Alabama with no money.

1031
01:06:54,007 --> 01:06:57,158
So she married my father
to get out.

1032
01:06:57,327 --> 01:07:00,797
But, before they could go,
I came.

1033
01:07:01,447 --> 01:07:03,358
So she deserted me,

1034
01:07:03,927 --> 01:07:06,316
leaving me with my aunts.

1035
01:07:06,487 --> 01:07:10,480
And when my father failed
to deliver her to Park Avenue,

1036
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:13,357
she deserted him, too.

1037
01:07:14,367 --> 01:07:16,562
Because she was beautiful.

1038
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:26,284
So beautiful...

1039
01:07:28,327 --> 01:07:31,876
She married again,
this time to Joe Capote.

1040
01:07:32,047 --> 01:07:34,003
He had a job in New York

1041
01:07:34,327 --> 01:07:37,797
and worked all hours
until her dream came true.

1042
01:07:38,127 --> 01:07:42,723
We moved to 1060 Park Avenue.
Mother was thrilled.

1043
01:07:44,087 --> 01:07:48,319
It seemed to extinguish
some sort of anxiety in her.

1044
01:07:50,927 --> 01:07:54,078
But the way Joe got us there
couldn’t keep us there.

1045
01:07:54,847 --> 01:07:57,156
He'd embezzled the money,

1046
01:07:57,687 --> 01:08:00,201
100 thousand dollars.

1047
01:08:01,927 --> 01:08:03,724
He was fired and tainted.

1048
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:06,401
He told mother we'd have to move.

1049
01:08:06,567 --> 01:08:09,240
But not to a smaller place
on Park Avenue,

1050
01:08:09,407 --> 01:08:12,126
but to a cold-water flat
in the Bronx.

1051
01:08:15,807 --> 01:08:17,718
She couldn’t take it.

1052
01:08:22,607 --> 01:08:27,317
She frantically tried to save money
in any way so they could stay,

1053
01:08:27,527 --> 01:08:31,042
eating less,
not buying lipstick...

1054
01:08:34,247 --> 01:08:38,957
She'd stopped drinking when they
moved, but now she stopped stopping.

1055
01:08:39,567 --> 01:08:43,196
And when that failed to restore
a sense of calm,

1056
01:08:44,727 --> 01:08:47,685
she swallowed a bottle
of sleeping pills.

1057
01:09:00,967 --> 01:09:03,037
I'm sorry about before.

1058
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,923
I thought you were trying
to trick me.

1059
01:09:09,007 --> 01:09:10,486
Trick you?

1060
01:09:11,007 --> 01:09:13,123
My mother killed herself, too.

1061
01:09:15,607 --> 01:09:16,676
How?

1062
01:09:16,847 --> 01:09:19,725
The slow way.
Drank herself to death.

1063
01:09:21,487 --> 01:09:22,636
Drinking.

1064
01:09:23,207 --> 01:09:25,846
Suicide for the faint of heart.

1065
01:09:26,767 --> 01:09:29,759
My brother couldn’t wait.
He killed himself, too.

1066
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:31,281
My God.

1067
01:09:32,367 --> 01:09:33,686
So you're all alone?

1068
01:09:33,847 --> 01:09:34,802
No.

1069
01:09:36,327 --> 01:09:37,919
I have a sister.

1070
01:09:39,047 --> 01:09:41,277
You want to know
what I think of her?

1071
01:09:41,967 --> 01:09:44,720
I think she's one evil bastard.

1072
01:09:46,247 --> 01:09:49,000
You want to see the ball-busting
letter she sent me?

1073
01:10:02,567 --> 01:10:03,920
Pay attention.

1074
01:10:05,847 --> 01:10:07,997
This could be good for our book.

1075
01:10:19,727 --> 01:10:21,001
I don't feel like talking.

1076
01:10:21,167 --> 01:10:24,079
I thought we were off
to a good start.

1077
01:10:24,407 --> 01:10:27,080
After you left,
that asshoIe next door said,

1078
01:10:27,247 --> 01:10:30,523
''Hey Smith, how come your brother
and mother never visit?'' He'd heard.

1079
01:10:30,687 --> 01:10:31,836
Fuck him, who cares?

1080
01:10:32,007 --> 01:10:34,726
When I'm talking to you, I forget
other people are going to read it.

1081
01:10:34,887 --> 01:10:37,003
And then I think about how
you stabbed Brando in the back.

1082
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:40,477
What I'm gonna write about you will
help. people think more of you.

1083
01:10:40,687 --> 01:10:43,076
You're not thinking clearly.
How can you?

1084
01:10:43,247 --> 01:10:46,080
You're under the most
unimaginable pressure.

1085
01:10:46,247 --> 01:10:48,363
Doesn't wittle Perry wike it here?

1086
01:10:48,527 --> 01:10:50,040
Shut the fuck up, Andrews!

1087
01:10:50,207 --> 01:10:51,435
Hush now.

1088
01:10:52,447 --> 01:10:53,960
Be above him.

1089
01:10:56,967 --> 01:10:58,161
Come.

1090
01:11:09,007 --> 01:11:11,680
This can be our little tree house.

1091
01:11:13,447 --> 01:11:15,961
How come y'all so quiet?

1092
01:11:17,567 --> 01:11:18,886
Now...

1093
01:11:20,927 --> 01:11:23,236
I want you to relax.

1094
01:11:23,687 --> 01:11:26,406
I can't. Not here.
Not with him.

1095
01:11:26,567 --> 01:11:29,923
I may be wrong, but there was
something in your letter

1096
01:11:30,247 --> 01:11:33,603
that made me think
you have the soul of an artist.

1097
01:11:34,647 --> 01:11:37,286
Artists have the power,
through our imagination,

1098
01:11:38,487 --> 01:11:43,197
to escape a degenerate world
and create a better one.

1099
01:11:44,367 --> 01:11:45,402
How?

1100
01:11:45,887 --> 01:11:47,684
Close your eyes.

1101
01:11:48,167 --> 01:11:49,361
Why?

1102
01:11:51,367 --> 01:11:52,846
Trust me.

1103
01:11:55,207 --> 01:11:56,162
Now...

1104
01:11:56,327 --> 01:11:59,683
I want you to picture
the most serene

1105
01:11:59,967 --> 01:12:02,879
and relaxing place you know.

1106
01:12:03,287 --> 01:12:04,640
Mexico.

1107
01:12:04,807 --> 01:12:08,959
I know it well.
Water like liquid turquoise.

1108
01:12:10,807 --> 01:12:14,720
Feel that hot sun
beating down on you,

1109
01:12:16,087 --> 01:12:19,045
warming all the tension
out of you.

1110
01:12:20,327 --> 01:12:23,842
Feel the heat soaking into you.

1111
01:12:25,767 --> 01:12:26,836
And then...

1112
01:12:28,087 --> 01:12:31,682
gentle as a feather
falling past your cheek...

1113
01:12:33,207 --> 01:12:35,198
there's a breeze.

1114
01:12:38,327 --> 01:12:39,726
Close them.

1115
01:12:41,287 --> 01:12:42,436
Good.

1116
01:12:43,607 --> 01:12:45,757
Feel the breeze...

1117
01:12:48,807 --> 01:12:51,765
that sensual breath from heaven.

1118
01:12:53,927 --> 01:12:55,963
Just let go,

1119
01:12:56,887 --> 01:12:59,355
relax every muscle.

1120
01:13:11,647 --> 01:13:12,921
I'm ready.

1121
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:20,280
When I was a boy,
we were always moving around.

1122
01:13:20,447 --> 01:13:23,803
His parents were rodeo performers.

1123
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,800
It was a hard life
in a lot of ways, but...

1124
01:13:27,207 --> 01:13:29,767
it sure looked good
once we lost it.

1125
01:13:30,847 --> 01:13:33,236
Mom and Dad had to quit.

1126
01:13:34,007 --> 01:13:37,238
That kind of riding
wears your bones out.

1127
01:13:37,887 --> 01:13:40,799
But that's what they were:
riders.

1128
01:13:42,407 --> 01:13:44,398
So when that went away,

1129
01:13:45,407 --> 01:13:46,965
everything went with it.

1130
01:13:48,047 --> 01:13:50,003
Jesus, Flo.

1131
01:13:50,167 --> 01:13:51,725
Fuck off!
It's just beer.

1132
01:13:52,927 --> 01:13:53,996
Fucking asshoIe!

1133
01:13:55,727 --> 01:13:59,003
So Mom left him, and she took me
and my brother and sister with her.

1134
01:14:05,367 --> 01:14:07,756
I dreamed Dad would rescue me.

1135
01:14:08,167 --> 01:14:09,839
How funny.

1136
01:14:11,807 --> 01:14:13,081
Me, too.

1137
01:14:16,287 --> 01:14:20,405
Every day I waited for him,
but he never came.

1138
01:14:20,567 --> 01:14:23,001
And then one day
I was walking to school...

1139
01:14:30,407 --> 01:14:32,477
Please be real, please be real.

1140
01:14:32,807 --> 01:14:34,604
Please be real.

1141
01:14:37,687 --> 01:14:38,802
Dad.

1142
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,558
Are you here to take me with you?

1143
01:14:43,727 --> 01:14:46,605
I wish I could, but I can't.

1144
01:14:48,687 --> 01:14:50,757
I don't know how
to take care of you.

1145
01:14:54,047 --> 01:14:56,845
I came to tell you to be
the best boy you can be.

1146
01:14:58,087 --> 01:14:59,918
And he made me get down.

1147
01:15:00,967 --> 01:15:04,642
He hated his old lady.
Never forgave her.

1148
01:15:04,807 --> 01:15:07,116
She took his daddy away.

1149
01:15:07,567 --> 01:15:09,159
A boy needs his daddy.

1150
01:15:09,767 --> 01:15:11,723
And did he hate the father, too?

1151
01:15:12,167 --> 01:15:16,877
He always said he hated his old man,
but he used to do this thing...

1152
01:15:17,167 --> 01:15:21,683
this excruciatingly poignant thing.

1153
01:15:22,447 --> 01:15:26,963
Dick says that sometimes
when I'd be sleeping...

1154
01:15:28,727 --> 01:15:29,842
Dad.

1155
01:15:32,847 --> 01:15:34,075
Dad.

1156
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:36,766
Where you been?

1157
01:15:38,527 --> 01:15:40,483
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

1158
01:15:42,327 --> 01:15:44,887
Years later, after the Army,

1159
01:15:45,047 --> 01:15:48,642
I got a letterfrom Dad
saying he had an idea to make money.

1160
01:15:48,807 --> 01:15:50,559
Wanted me to come help him.

1161
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:55,681
I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't
pretty jazzed up when I got it.

1162
01:15:56,647 --> 01:15:58,558
He finally had a place for me.

1163
01:15:59,367 --> 01:16:02,882
I was gonna sing
and play my guitar in the bar.

1164
01:16:03,527 --> 01:16:07,679
I painted all the pictures.
I even painted the sign.

1165
01:16:07,847 --> 01:16:09,485
Nobody's coming here!

1166
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:13,200
Nobody!

1167
01:16:14,047 --> 01:16:15,526
Know why?

1168
01:16:16,007 --> 01:16:20,080
It's because of you,
you useless piece of shit!

1169
01:16:20,247 --> 01:16:22,203
Your fucking sign is no good!

1170
01:16:22,367 --> 01:16:25,404
I said, ''Buy a neon sign''

1171
01:16:25,567 --> 01:16:28,001
and you said,
''I’ll paint us a good one.''

1172
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:29,441
Fucking sissy.

1173
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:38,202
Come on.

1174
01:16:38,847 --> 01:16:40,963
He killed me, this guy.

1175
01:16:41,367 --> 01:16:46,077
Over and over my whole life.,
the things he said and did to me.

1176
01:16:48,287 --> 01:16:50,960
It was always like
having a knife in me.

1177
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:55,758
So I decided to kill him
right there, in cold blood.

1178
01:16:58,087 --> 01:16:59,839
You sissy.

1179
01:17:00,087 --> 01:17:01,315
But I couldn't do it.

1180
01:17:02,567 --> 01:17:06,640
And all this stuff about Dad...
and everything...

1181
01:17:08,647 --> 01:17:11,286
It's gonna make me look like
a fucking crybaby.

1182
01:17:11,447 --> 01:17:12,118
No.

1183
01:17:12,287 --> 01:17:15,438
It will help. people see you
as a complete person,

1184
01:17:15,687 --> 01:17:17,962
not just as someone
who has caused suffering,

1185
01:17:18,127 --> 01:17:20,163
but as someone who has suffered.

1186
01:17:21,927 --> 01:17:24,043
Can I see what
you've written so far?

1187
01:17:24,207 --> 01:17:27,722
Not till it's perfect.
But I promise, it's sympathetic.

1188
01:17:28,487 --> 01:17:31,081
No one's ever treated me
like you have.

1189
01:17:32,167 --> 01:17:34,397
Is it just to get me
to tell you stuff?

1190
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,882
No.

1191
01:17:36,487 --> 01:17:38,637
It's because I respect you.

1192
01:17:40,567 --> 01:17:43,127
All right. Time's up.

1193
01:17:53,807 --> 01:17:56,241
Thanks for that
beautiful thing you said.

1194
01:17:56,407 --> 01:17:58,045
What beautiful thing?

1195
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:00,720
About respect.

1196
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:34,082
So, I'm sympathetic, am I?

1197
01:18:34,887 --> 01:18:37,355
You been looking out for me,
have you?

1198
01:18:38,087 --> 01:18:42,797
What's the title of your book?
The ''sympathetic'' one about me?

1199
01:18:45,127 --> 01:18:49,837
I know the title. The fucking guard
told me, and it's not sympathetic.

1200
01:18:51,687 --> 01:18:54,645
It's called ''In Cold Blood,''
isn't it?

1201
01:18:55,287 --> 01:18:59,405
It is, isn't it?
It's called ''In Cold Fucking Blood''!

1202
01:18:59,567 --> 01:19:01,364
You sold me out, you shit.

1203
01:19:01,527 --> 01:19:04,485
After I opened myself up
and gave you everything.

1204
01:19:04,887 --> 01:19:07,037
Well, you're not gonna
get away with it.

1205
01:19:08,407 --> 01:19:10,125
One sound out of you...

1206
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:14,079
and you’ll join the Clutters
in hell.

1207
01:19:15,127 --> 01:19:16,082
Okay?

1208
01:19:22,567 --> 01:19:24,239
Open your mouth.

1209
01:19:25,847 --> 01:19:28,042
Open your mouth!

1210
01:19:28,887 --> 01:19:31,924
Open your fucking lying mouth!

1211
01:19:33,247 --> 01:19:35,761
You're gonna pay
for that title now.

1212
01:19:36,727 --> 01:19:40,163
You fucked me,
so now I'm gonna fuck you.

1213
01:20:16,207 --> 01:20:18,323
I'm not gonna rape you...

1214
01:20:19,007 --> 01:20:22,397
because you can trust me.

1215
01:20:23,967 --> 01:20:25,366
But look.

1216
01:20:26,567 --> 01:20:27,886
Look.

1217
01:20:30,807 --> 01:20:35,403
That's how your fucking title
made me feel.

1218
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:58,240
Don't let him in.

1219
01:20:59,207 --> 01:21:00,959
I need to talk to you, please.

1220
01:21:01,127 --> 01:21:02,321
From there.

1221
01:21:05,487 --> 01:21:07,443
Can we have some privacy?

1222
01:21:13,807 --> 01:21:18,483
''In Cold Blood'' is the title,
but it's not exactly what you think.

1223
01:21:19,927 --> 01:21:22,157
You boys did a monstrous thing.

1224
01:21:22,327 --> 01:21:25,797
And the public and their prosecutors
are calling for your blood..

1225
01:21:25,967 --> 01:21:28,561
If they get what they want,
they will kill you,

1226
01:21:28,727 --> 01:21:33,403
not in a senseless moment of passion
but with scrupulous premeditation.

1227
01:21:33,567 --> 01:21:36,843
That is the legal definition of
''in cold blood..''

1228
01:21:37,007 --> 01:21:40,204
This title is a condemnation
of their plans.

1229
01:21:40,367 --> 01:21:42,403
But not only their plans.

1230
01:21:42,567 --> 01:21:45,445
No. No, not only.

1231
01:21:46,407 --> 01:21:50,320
Look, you did a terrible thing.
You're not innocent.

1232
01:21:51,367 --> 01:21:55,838
That doesn't mean you're not a human
being. I want people to see that.

1233
01:21:56,007 --> 01:21:59,317
I'm not talking to you until
I've read what you've written.

1234
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:14,638
It's tough to read
the family stuff.

1235
01:22:16,327 --> 01:22:18,204
But you told it to me.

1236
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:19,846
Not my family.

1237
01:22:20,967 --> 01:22:22,400
The Clutters.

1238
01:22:27,367 --> 01:22:30,518
There better be more than this in
this house, or you’ll sure be sorry.

1239
01:22:32,327 --> 01:22:33,521
Get him to the basement.

1240
01:22:33,927 --> 01:22:35,519
I’ll get the old man.

1241
01:22:36,447 --> 01:22:40,918
You don't think about it if someone
has a boyfriend, or is in 4-H.

1242
01:22:41,087 --> 01:22:44,716
Why don't you put some clothes on?
It's gonna be cold down there.

1243
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:46,676
Yes, sir.

1244
01:22:46,927 --> 01:22:49,122
We didn't know anything about them.

1245
01:22:52,807 --> 01:22:54,877
Except that they had a safe.

1246
01:22:55,567 --> 01:22:58,081
But I don't have a safe.

1247
01:22:58,447 --> 01:23:02,599
How old are you, baby?
Well, now don't be scared.

1248
01:23:03,367 --> 01:23:05,562
Let me help. you down
with these covers.

1249
01:23:06,087 --> 01:23:07,236
Out here, now.

1250
01:23:07,607 --> 01:23:08,722
Now!

1251
01:23:10,487 --> 01:23:12,318
You touch her and I’ll kill you.

1252
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:13,886
You can ride her when I'm done.

1253
01:23:14,047 --> 01:23:16,959
Let's just go. There's no safe.
You fucking blew that.

1254
01:23:17,127 --> 01:23:20,722
We're not leaving, baby.
They've seen us plain.

1255
01:23:20,887 --> 01:23:24,163
Get down to the basement so we can
take care of it. I’ll be right down.

1256
01:23:24,327 --> 01:23:25,806
I'm not leaving you here.

1257
01:23:26,727 --> 01:23:28,638
Fuck you then!

1258
01:23:29,767 --> 01:23:31,041
Let's go.

1259
01:24:16,327 --> 01:24:18,318
I know this is crazy,

1260
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:22,245
but when I looked in his eyes,
I was thinking:

1261
01:24:22,687 --> 01:24:25,042
''Too bad we couldn’t be friends.''

1262
01:24:26,367 --> 01:24:29,200
He had 4-H stuff in his room.

1263
01:24:29,567 --> 01:24:32,639
And I could have told him
about my folks and the rodeo.

1264
01:24:37,887 --> 01:24:39,684
Why don't you kiss him?

1265
01:24:39,847 --> 01:24:40,677
Fuck off!

1266
01:24:40,847 --> 01:24:44,157
You never like anything with girls.
Never want a whore when I got one.

1267
01:24:44,327 --> 01:24:45,282
Shut up!

1268
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:48,166
You won't even watch me when I'm on
one. You like boys better? Go ahead.

1269
01:24:48,327 --> 01:24:50,682
-Then I can break his sister's box.
-Shut up, Dick!

1270
01:24:50,847 --> 01:24:52,883
Go ahead, sugar, kiss him.

1271
01:24:54,087 --> 01:24:56,237
Or would you rather kiss
his daddy?

1272
01:25:06,967 --> 01:25:09,276
Shit, Perry!
His hand came free!

1273
01:25:31,287 --> 01:25:34,040
Here, now you kill the women.

1274
01:25:58,127 --> 01:26:00,083
I wish I could have saved them...

1275
01:26:01,927 --> 01:26:03,360
but at least...

1276
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:07,602
I knew what he wanted to do
with that girl.

1277
01:26:13,207 --> 01:26:15,243
Least I spared her that.

1278
01:26:27,727 --> 01:26:31,800
About the best example I can give
you of his split nature is this.

1279
01:26:31,967 --> 01:26:34,800
He told me what he thought
of Herb Clutter.

1280
01:26:34,967 --> 01:26:39,483
He said, ''Right before I cut his
throat, I thought how nice he was.''

1281
01:26:39,647 --> 01:26:42,081
''He was a nice,
soft-spoken gentleman.

1282
01:26:42,247 --> 01:26:45,045
I thought that right before
I cut his throat.''

1283
01:26:45,487 --> 01:26:48,718
''I thought he was a very nice
gentleman. Soft-spoken.''

1284
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:53,041
I thought so right up to the moment
I cut his throat.''

1285
01:26:53,207 --> 01:26:55,198
What an extraordinary
thing to say.

1286
01:26:55,367 --> 01:26:56,766
Extraordinary.

1287
01:27:12,567 --> 01:27:13,920
So how's the book?

1288
01:27:14,087 --> 01:27:18,046
Well, it's coming. I have to leave
in a couple of days for their trial.

1289
01:27:18,207 --> 01:27:21,199
That's all pro forma, right?
They're not contesting anything.

1290
01:27:21,367 --> 01:27:23,835
No, they hope for life.,
not death.

1291
01:27:24,007 --> 01:27:26,077
Death would be better
for the book.

1292
01:27:26,247 --> 01:27:30,206
It would satisfy the reader more.
It would make the title work, too.

1293
01:27:31,847 --> 01:27:35,635
Honey, I've worked harder on this
than anything in my whole life..

1294
01:27:35,807 --> 01:27:39,925
I don't want it ruined just because
a jury makes a dumb decision.

1295
01:27:40,887 --> 01:27:43,401
Gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

1296
01:27:43,567 --> 01:27:44,841
We have, your Honor.

1297
01:27:45,447 --> 01:27:47,881
Will the clerk please bring
the verdict up?

1298
01:27:54,247 --> 01:27:57,762
We, the jury, find the defendant,
Perry Edward Smith,

1299
01:27:58,327 --> 01:28:01,399
guilty of the crime of murder
in the first degree.

1300
01:28:02,127 --> 01:28:03,355
And the punishment

1301
01:28:07,327 --> 01:28:08,442
is death.

1302
01:28:12,807 --> 01:28:14,206
Will you appeal?

1303
01:28:14,567 --> 01:28:15,636
Dick wants to.

1304
01:28:16,407 --> 01:28:17,806
But we’ll hang.

1305
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:19,316
We should.

1306
01:28:20,807 --> 01:28:23,037
You think hanging is fair?

1307
01:28:23,287 --> 01:28:26,120
It's funny. Last night I was laying
awake and thinking:

1308
01:28:26,607 --> 01:28:29,201
''What is punishment?''

1309
01:28:31,127 --> 01:28:35,040
Being in jail isn't punishment, if
you didn't like it on the outside.

1310
01:28:35,847 --> 01:28:39,396
And neither is death,
if it was painful to live.

1311
01:28:42,087 --> 01:28:44,317
I’ll tell you what punishment
is for me.

1312
01:28:44,807 --> 01:28:45,842
What?

1313
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:49,923
It's hoping there's someone
for you.

1314
01:28:51,567 --> 01:28:54,081
And after years of no one...

1315
01:28:54,247 --> 01:28:57,444
you find him
and you can't have him.

1316
01:29:11,727 --> 01:29:14,321
We really connected, didn't we?

1317
01:29:14,527 --> 01:29:16,006
Of course, we did.

1318
01:29:16,167 --> 01:29:18,886
You weren't being nice to me
just for the book, were you?

1319
01:29:19,047 --> 01:29:22,039
No! I think about you
all the time.

1320
01:29:22,207 --> 01:29:23,356
Dick, too?

1321
01:29:23,927 --> 01:29:25,599
Only for the book.

1322
01:29:27,047 --> 01:29:29,800
You're the only person
I ever feel real around.

1323
01:29:30,127 --> 01:29:31,196
Me, too.

1324
01:29:31,367 --> 01:29:35,519
I don't have to act like
a little wind-up toy with you.

1325
01:29:44,727 --> 01:29:45,921
Perry...

1326
01:29:47,927 --> 01:29:50,282
I don't want you to die.

1327
01:30:33,007 --> 01:30:35,680
Look, Ron and Nancy Reagan
we're not.

1328
01:30:38,127 --> 01:30:42,643
We're apart for long times.
We know we have to have sex.

1329
01:30:44,727 --> 01:30:46,160
But we're men.

1330
01:30:46,767 --> 01:30:50,885
We can have sex just to release
the desire to have sex.

1331
01:30:51,447 --> 01:30:54,007
What's not allowed
is falling in love.

1332
01:31:02,887 --> 01:31:05,117
You see, that would be betrayal.

1333
01:31:08,287 --> 01:31:11,518
A terrible breach
of a very mature

1334
01:31:12,647 --> 01:31:15,286
and very sensible arrangement.

1335
01:31:15,647 --> 01:31:19,686
After the verdicts,
Truman buried himself in the book.

1336
01:31:20,207 --> 01:31:22,767
By mid '63 it was done.

1337
01:31:22,927 --> 01:31:27,205
Perfect as a diamond,
as tough, as multi-faceted,

1338
01:31:27,607 --> 01:31:29,165
only this time...

1339
01:31:29,327 --> 01:31:31,204
it had kindness.

1340
01:31:32,287 --> 01:31:35,723
But we couldn’t publish it
until it had an ending,

1341
01:31:35,887 --> 01:31:39,084
until something had been settled
about the boys.

1342
01:31:39,247 --> 01:31:42,000
There were 4 appeals,
all the way to the Supreme Court.

1343
01:31:42,167 --> 01:31:44,601
It took 5 full years
for a final judgment.

1344
01:31:44,767 --> 01:31:48,237
That was hard on the killers, which
doesn't make a difference to me.

1345
01:31:48,527 --> 01:31:49,516
But...

1346
01:32:01,287 --> 01:32:04,563
Do you have any word yet about
when the book is coming out?

1347
01:32:04,727 --> 01:32:05,955
I don't know.

1348
01:32:09,087 --> 01:32:12,477
You simply cannot conceive
of the agony.

1349
01:32:15,727 --> 01:32:19,959
I've worked on this book ceaselessly
for four years,

1350
01:32:20,887 --> 01:32:25,597
pouring the whole of myself into it,
head and heart.

1351
01:32:25,967 --> 01:32:28,561
And then to be waiting like this,

1352
01:32:28,727 --> 01:32:32,083
unable to publish what I've done
until they're hanged...

1353
01:32:32,727 --> 01:32:34,399
I can hardly wait.

1354
01:32:35,407 --> 01:32:39,685
Do you feel that your book
is worth a human life.?

1355
01:32:39,847 --> 01:32:41,724
Well, it's certainly worth Dick's.

1356
01:32:42,127 --> 01:32:43,719
What about the other man?

1357
01:32:44,247 --> 01:32:47,239
His name is Perry.

1358
01:32:48,087 --> 01:32:50,965
I mean, it's just
an intolerable position.

1359
01:32:52,167 --> 01:32:55,921
Because to get an ending
for the book means an end for...

1360
01:33:04,607 --> 01:33:07,963
On death row, you may only write
two letters a week.

1361
01:33:09,287 --> 01:33:12,165
Every week, for five years,

1362
01:33:14,327 --> 01:33:16,477
Perry wrote both letters
to Truman.

1363
01:33:16,647 --> 01:33:19,366
Friend Truman,
cold in Kansas today...

1364
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:23,517
though not as frigid as I imagine
it is in Switzerland.

1365
01:33:23,967 --> 01:33:25,525
How big are those Alps?

1366
01:33:25,687 --> 01:33:29,362
Friend Truman, do you know the song
''Gold Mine in the Sky''?

1367
01:33:30,127 --> 01:33:31,685
It was Dad's favorite.

1368
01:33:33,007 --> 01:33:36,204
Maybe you could use your influence
on the authorities in this shithole

1369
01:33:36,407 --> 01:33:38,921
and get me a tape recorder
so I could sing it for you.

1370
01:33:39,087 --> 01:33:40,964
Not much to say today.

1371
01:33:41,487 --> 01:33:43,045
Awful blue.

1372
01:33:44,127 --> 01:33:45,606
God, I miss you.

1373
01:33:45,927 --> 01:33:47,246
Please write soon.

1374
01:33:47,407 --> 01:33:50,444
You can't imagine what it does to me
when they bring the mail

1375
01:33:50,607 --> 01:33:52,245
and there's something from you.

1376
01:33:52,407 --> 01:33:53,681
Friend Truman:

1377
01:33:54,727 --> 01:33:56,319
It's all over.

1378
01:33:57,327 --> 01:33:59,602
Our last appeal has been denied.

1379
01:33:59,767 --> 01:34:02,884
Dick and I are allowed to have
a witness at the hanging.

1380
01:34:03,087 --> 01:34:04,679
We both pick you.

1381
01:34:06,367 --> 01:34:08,403
You have to come with me.

1382
01:34:08,567 --> 01:34:09,556
I can't.

1383
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:14,084
I'm getting desperate about my new
book. It's not coming together.

1384
01:34:22,167 --> 01:34:24,522
Anyway, I thought this
was what you wanted.

1385
01:34:24,687 --> 01:34:26,678
I know I said that,

1386
01:34:27,207 --> 01:34:29,198
but to see him killed?

1387
01:34:31,527 --> 01:34:33,438
It's too much.

1388
01:34:34,247 --> 01:34:36,522
-I don't suppose Jack would.
-No.

1389
01:34:38,287 --> 01:34:39,925
He wouldn’t anyway, but...

1390
01:34:40,647 --> 01:34:44,481
for some reason,
he gets funny about Perry.

1391
01:34:46,007 --> 01:34:48,237
It's like he's jealous.

1392
01:34:53,207 --> 01:34:54,356
Truman...

1393
01:34:57,767 --> 01:34:59,246
are you and Perry?

1394
01:34:59,407 --> 01:35:01,125
Please, Nelle.

1395
01:35:03,047 --> 01:35:04,958
I'm begging you.

1396
01:35:07,687 --> 01:35:09,120
But I couldn’t.

1397
01:35:10,247 --> 01:35:11,680
And I wouldn’t.

1398
01:35:14,727 --> 01:35:17,958
I'm sorry, he can't take the call.

1399
01:35:20,847 --> 01:35:22,200
It was the boys again.

1400
01:35:22,607 --> 01:35:24,325
They want me to help.,

1401
01:35:25,287 --> 01:35:26,720
but I can't help. them.

1402
01:35:27,727 --> 01:35:30,719
Maybe they want you for comfort.

1403
01:35:35,487 --> 01:35:37,045
Rain is good.

1404
01:35:39,167 --> 01:35:41,681
I hope he apologizes.

1405
01:35:44,287 --> 01:35:46,926
That would really make him
sympathetic.

1406
01:35:57,287 --> 01:36:00,165
Hey, Truman. Where you been?

1407
01:36:03,047 --> 01:36:05,003
I thought you were gonna spend
the whole day with us.

1408
01:36:05,167 --> 01:36:09,877
I couldn’t get here earlier,
I was making calls on your behalf.

1409
01:36:14,127 --> 01:36:15,765
It's just so late now.

1410
01:36:15,927 --> 01:36:17,918
Hickock, let’s get ready.

1411
01:36:18,087 --> 01:36:19,202
We have some time.

1412
01:36:20,647 --> 01:36:22,763
I have something
I want to tell you.

1413
01:36:23,887 --> 01:36:28,597
They’ll ask if you have anything
to say, and you must apologize.

1414
01:36:30,447 --> 01:36:32,324
That won't bring them back.

1415
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:36,677
No. It restores
your humanity to you.

1416
01:36:52,567 --> 01:36:53,966
It's time.

1417
01:36:55,567 --> 01:36:58,604
Anyone saying goodbye
needs to say it here.

1418
01:37:05,807 --> 01:37:07,160
Bye, Truman.

1419
01:37:08,247 --> 01:37:09,521
Thanks for it.

1420
01:37:32,207 --> 01:37:34,004
Did he say anything to you?

1421
01:37:36,327 --> 01:37:39,478
He said he loved me

1422
01:37:39,927 --> 01:37:42,077
and he always had.

1423
01:38:25,087 --> 01:38:29,399
Richard Eugene Hickock.
Do you have anything to say?

1424
01:38:33,087 --> 01:38:35,396
Just that I hold no hard feelings.

1425
01:38:36,927 --> 01:38:38,440
You people are...

1426
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:42,762
sending me to a better world
than this one ever was.

1427
01:39:05,807 --> 01:39:09,641
''The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

1428
01:39:10,967 --> 01:39:14,118
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

1429
01:39:14,287 --> 01:39:16,357
He restoreth my soul.

1430
01:39:16,927 --> 01:39:20,966
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for His name's sake.

1431
01:39:22,087 --> 01:39:24,726
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadows of death,

1432
01:39:26,207 --> 01:39:29,995
I will fear no evil,
for Thou art with me.''

1433
01:39:55,207 --> 01:39:56,356
Not dead yet.

1434
01:40:23,647 --> 01:40:25,000
I still hear breathing.

1435
01:40:56,527 --> 01:40:57,676
Okay, he's ready.

1436
01:41:44,007 --> 01:41:48,046
Perry Edward Smith.
Do you have anything to say?

1437
01:41:51,087 --> 01:41:52,520
Friend Truman...

1438
01:41:53,847 --> 01:41:57,396
Now I don't know what you did,
but the tape recorder arrived.

1439
01:42:00,007 --> 01:42:04,717
There's a gold mine
in the sky far away.

1440
01:42:07,647 --> 01:42:12,357
We will find it, you and I,
some sweet day.

1441
01:42:15,327 --> 01:42:20,037
There'll be a clover just for you
down the line,

1442
01:42:22,927 --> 01:42:26,442
where the skies are always blue,

1443
01:42:27,327 --> 01:42:28,601
pal of mine.

1444
01:42:32,047 --> 01:42:33,400
Far away,

1445
01:42:36,287 --> 01:42:38,517
far away.

1446
01:42:40,767 --> 01:42:45,238
We will find that long lost
gold mine some sweet day.

1447
01:42:47,967 --> 01:42:51,642
And we'll say hello to friends
who said goodbye.

1448
01:42:57,087 --> 01:42:59,681
When we find that long lost
gold mine

1449
01:43:00,727 --> 01:43:01,876
in the

1450
01:43:04,127 --> 01:43:05,116
sky.

1451
01:43:05,687 --> 01:43:08,724
''The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.''

1452
01:43:21,767 --> 01:43:23,723
Was he able to speak?

1453
01:43:23,887 --> 01:43:25,320
Yes, he spoke.

1454
01:43:26,047 --> 01:43:27,366
What did he say?

1455
01:43:28,367 --> 01:43:30,198
Smith did not speak.

1456
01:43:30,367 --> 01:43:32,642
He apologized.

1457
01:43:33,087 --> 01:43:35,043
Just chewed his gum.

1458
01:43:36,447 --> 01:43:40,520
You saw those two men hanged.
It must be...

1459
01:43:43,007 --> 01:43:44,838
Isn't it painful for you?

1460
01:43:49,647 --> 01:43:53,481
Babaling, life. is painful.

1461
01:43:53,927 --> 01:43:58,045
It's the one experience
that unites the rich and poor.

1462
01:43:59,007 --> 01:44:02,204
I suppose I'm able to endure it

1463
01:44:02,367 --> 01:44:07,077
because I can alchemize
what wounds me into art.

1464
01:44:08,047 --> 01:44:09,082
Yes, but...

1465
01:44:13,167 --> 01:44:14,998
at what cost?

1466
01:44:17,047 --> 01:44:21,677
It made him the most famous author
in America and very, very rich.

1467
01:44:21,847 --> 01:44:24,486
He moved to Manhattan where,
oddly,

1468
01:44:24,647 --> 01:44:28,686
he had a very good view
of the place he had left.

1469
01:44:39,847 --> 01:44:42,680
Who ever knows what
our hearts will want?

1470
01:44:43,967 --> 01:44:45,161
Who can

1471
01:44:47,447 --> 01:44:49,642
defend themselves from it?

1472
01:44:56,367 --> 01:44:58,927
Seeing what's happened
to him since,

1473
01:44:59,207 --> 01:45:03,485
well, despite the bravado that
only appears to be confidence,

1474
01:45:05,087 --> 01:45:09,797
I have come to feel
with great heart-sickness

1475
01:45:13,647 --> 01:45:17,401
that there were three deaths
on the gallows that night.

1476
01:45:18,087 --> 01:45:20,396
He never wrote anything big again.

1477
01:45:20,727 --> 01:45:24,720
Just collections,
fragments pulled together.

1478
01:45:25,847 --> 01:45:30,557
God knows he didn't have to write,
not after all that money he made.

1479
01:45:32,607 --> 01:45:34,120
It's funny.

1480
01:45:34,367 --> 01:45:36,198
It made him, and...

1481
01:45:36,487 --> 01:45:37,966
it ruined him.

1482
01:45:38,407 --> 01:45:39,965
You know, in his will,

1483
01:45:41,967 --> 01:45:44,322
Perry left everything to Truman.

1484
01:45:51,887 --> 01:45:56,199
America is not a country where
the small gesture goes noticed.

1485
01:45:57,287 --> 01:45:59,881
We're not a country like France,

1486
01:46:01,047 --> 01:46:05,199
where charm, something light
or effervescent

1487
01:46:05,367 --> 01:46:07,005
can survive.

1488
01:46:07,967 --> 01:46:09,958
We want everything you have

1489
01:46:10,127 --> 01:46:13,403
and we want it as fast
as you can turn it out.

1490
01:47:02,207 --> 01:47:05,085
I read an interview with
Frank Sinatra

1491
01:47:05,367 --> 01:47:07,961
in which he said about
Judy Garland:

1492
01:47:08,127 --> 01:47:12,120
''Every time she sings,
she dies a little.''

1493
01:47:14,607 --> 01:47:16,882
That's how much she gave.

1494
01:47:20,167 --> 01:47:22,362
It's true for writers, too...

1495
01:47:23,567 --> 01:47:26,286
who hope to create
something lasting.

1496
01:47:27,767 --> 01:47:30,235
They die a little getting it right.

1497
01:47:32,087 --> 01:47:34,601
And then the book comes out

1498
01:47:36,527 --> 01:47:38,358
and there's a dinner.

1499
01:47:39,527 --> 01:47:41,757
Maybe they give you a prize.

1500
01:47:43,327 --> 01:47:47,081
And then comes the inevitable
and very American question:

1501
01:47:47,447 --> 01:47:49,005
What's next?

1502
01:47:53,127 --> 01:47:55,357
But the next thing can be

1503
01:47:58,927 --> 01:48:00,679
so hard...

1504
01:48:04,087 --> 01:48:06,726
because now you now
what it demands.

1505
01:48:08,967 --> 01:48:10,400
Hi, Nelle.

1506
01:48:10,567 --> 01:48:14,446
I just began my novel and I had
such a good morning writing

1507
01:48:14,767 --> 01:48:16,758
that I want to celebrate.

1508
01:48:16,927 --> 01:48:18,758
Want to come to lunch?

1509
01:48:21,727 --> 01:48:24,958
No, honey, I don't care where.

1510
01:48:27,687 --> 01:48:30,838
Just someplace pretty
where we can have fun

1511
01:48:31,487 --> 01:48:33,398
and be ourselves.
