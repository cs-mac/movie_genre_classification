1
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,661
History prefers legends to men.

2
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,947
It prefers nobility to brutality.

3
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,709
Soaring speeches to quiet deeds.

4
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:11,221
History remembers the battle
and forgets the blood.

5
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,787
Whatever history remembers of me,
if it remembers anything at all...

6
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,303
it shall only be
a fraction of the truth.

7
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,304
For whatever else I am,
a husband, a lawyer...

8
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,785
a president...

9
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,747
I shall always think of myself
as a man who struggled against darkness.

10
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,348
I leave in your trusted hands,
my dear friend Henry...

11
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,906
this record that begins
when I was just a bay.

12
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,705
Get on down there. Hurry it up!

13
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,591
Please, sir, no.
There's been some kind of mistake.

14
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,145
I ain't no slave.

15
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,781
Let them go! Aaron!

16
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,867
Go back inside!

17
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,427
Let them go!

18
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,466
Will!

19
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,031
- Quiet!
- He's my friend!

20
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,266
Look away, Abraham.

21
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,387
It's not our place.

22
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,021
Look away.

23
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,501
Abraham!

24
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,746
Thomas, help them!

25
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,704
Leave him alone!

26
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,347
Are you all right?

27
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,667
Did you strike my friend here?

28
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,861
He was beating my son!

29
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,425
Did you strike him, Lincoln?

30
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,429
They're not slaves, and you know it.

31
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,621
I suggest you get back to your work

32
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,549
before you find yourself
led away in chains.

33
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,664
Until every man is free,
we are all slaves.

34
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,785
Very well, then.

35
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,307
Since you're all
so concerned with freedom...

36
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,391
you may consider yourself free
from the burden of my employ.

37
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,543
And the debt you've been working off...

38
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,869
I'd like it paid in full with interest.

39
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,589
Now, please.

40
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,947
If you get one more penny
from me, Mr. Barts...

41
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,347
it will come with a fist
wrapped around it.

42
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,667
All right, Mr. Lincoln.

43
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,910
There are other ways to collect a debt.

44
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,270
No!

45
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,144
What's happening to her, Father?

46
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,944
Please help her!
Please, I beg of you.

47
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,711
You've got to do something, Father.

48
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,267
Easy, child.

49
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,620
Look away, Abraham.

50
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,464
I've never seen anything like this.

51
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,021
Strange.

52
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,749
You promise me.

53
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,024
Let's step outside.

54
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,388
I'm sorry, I don't know what ails her.

55
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,307
Abraham.

56
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,105
Come and lie next to me.

57
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,464
I've been writing, Mama.

58
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,268
"Days are swift as an Indian arrow...

59
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,782
"flying like a shooting star.

60
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,462
"The present day is here...

61
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,944
"and then slides away in haste...

62
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,349
"that we can never say is ours...

63
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,146
"but only say...

64
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,229
"is passed. "

65
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,266
Mother?

66
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,431
Mother?

67
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,143
Mama once told me that
I hadn't cried when I was born.

68
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,146
That I'd simply opened my eyes...

69
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,867
looked at her smiling face...
and smiled back.

70
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,304
My light was gone.

71
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,141
- I don't know how he did it-
- Abraham...

72
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,661
you promise me...

73
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,943
You promise me you won't go
and do anything foolish.

74
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,380
Nine years later,
my father joined her in death.

75
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,941
No longer bound by my promise...

76
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,861
I tried to fortify the nerve
to pursue my vengeance.

77
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,061
Haven't you had enough?

78
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,150
A boy only gets this drunk when
he wants to kiss a girl...

79
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,671
or kill a man.

80
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,470
Adam, let me explain.

81
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,991
Last one, Barts.

82
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,105
I'm not coming up here to clean up
your messes anymore.

83
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,667
Yes, sir. I promise.

84
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,549
Every so often, I think about what
it would be like to be in the South.

85
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,382
So, where's Henry?

86
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,945
Yes, sir.
We've been looking all over, sir.

87
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,346
Searching high and low.

88
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,825
Low is more likely.

89
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,422
Just find him, Barts.

90
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,147
Oh, and send a fresh crop south.

91
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,547
We have a lot of mouths to feed.

92
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,901
Yes, sir.

93
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,422
"Yes, sir, no, sir.
High, sir, low, sir. "

94
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,067
For my mother.

95
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,431
That was unlucky.

96
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,622
Might have put me out of my misery.

97
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,190
Where the hell are you running to?

98
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,469
Don't much like chasing chickens.

99
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,750
Little boy, all grown up.

100
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,101
Come to avenge his dear momma.

101
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,427
There are two kinds of men, Mr. Lincoln.

102
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,668
Those that have the guts
to pull the trigger...

103
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,989
and those who do not.

104
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,268
Powder, patch, ball.

105
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,541
Don't mess it up.

106
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,148
You weren't asleep that night.

107
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,227
Were you?

108
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,745
You dropped the ball, Mr. Lincoln.

109
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,749
Your mama's blood was sickening sweet.

110
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,744
I hope yours tastes better!

111
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,702
Might I suggest that we begin by...

112
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,467
closing the door?

113
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,226
Yeah, I'm sorry.

114
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,230
I didn't see anything!

115
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,225
Should we dive right in?

116
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,786
Or are you finding Gabrielle's
egress too distracting?

117
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,464
I'm sorry, sir, but who are you?

118
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,822
Who I am is Henry Sturges.

119
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,263
And where you are is my home.

120
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,230
And what happened...

121
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,025
I saved your life...

122
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,030
during your rather pathetic attempt
at taking another's.

123
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,551
What were you doing there, and...

124
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,470
how did you know
I would try to kill Barts?

125
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,947
How?

126
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,462
I watched this boy carry out
his first long-awaited mission.

127
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,744
Drunk, might I add.

128
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,981
And I think, "You have wasted
your time watching this one, Henry.

129
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,787
"He's not a promising recruit.

130
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,828
"He is just a selfish boy
with his heart set on vengeance. "

131
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,101
And I realized,
"This boy is a goddamned idiot!"

132
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,464
"I doubt he even knew
his target was a vampire. "

133
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,706
A vampire?

134
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,790
Yes. Immortal, blood-sucking demons.

135
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,789
Fortunately for you, Mr. Lincoln...

136
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,823
hunting them is something of a hobby.

137
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,302
But vampires are just myths.

138
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,387
Myths don't beat you senseless

139
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,106
after you've put
a bullet in their brain.

140
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,187
Thank you.

141
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,507
No, Mr. Lincoln,
vampires are real.

142
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,829
They exist in every city
and every state...

143
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,746
in the Union.

144
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,061
If what you say is true,
you could help me kill him.

145
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,545
I could pay you to kill him!

146
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,629
My services are not for sale.

147
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,424
And the word you are looking for
is "destroy. "

148
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,340
It is quite a feat to kill that
which is already dead.

149
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,666
But you don't understand.

150
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,908
My mother was murdered.

151
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,708
And if I teach you how
to murder her murderer...

152
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,224
so what?

153
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,344
How will that honor her memory?

154
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,862
How will that benefit the next boy
whose mother is taken?

155
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,108
If vengeance is all you seek...

156
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,791
seek it elsewhere.

157
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,904
Teach me to fight as you do.
Please, I'll do anything you say.

158
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,785
You promise to cast aside
all notions of vengeance...

159
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,903
and commit to the life of a hunter?

160
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,950
You will have no friends...

161
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,346
no family.

162
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,467
I told him what he wanted to hear

163
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,028
but all I cared about was
killing the monster that took my mother.

164
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,111
I'm in.

165
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,425
Scottish Highland pistol.

166
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,702
And if one barrel isn't enough...

167
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,540
seven should do you.

168
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,780
The blunderbuss.

169
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,749
And if you lose your ball...

170
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,551
you can always stuff your pocket watch
down the end of it.

171
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,180
So, Abe...

172
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,867
which one takes your fancy?

173
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,745
Actually, I haven't had
the best of luck with shooting irons.

174
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,427
But...

175
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,263
I was a rail splitter.

176
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,266
I would like you to chop this tree down
with a single swing.

177
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,781
That tree?

178
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,142
It's got to be more than a foot across.
That's impossible.

179
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,625
But it isn't a tree.

180
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,310
It's what you hate most in the world.

181
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,870
So, tell me, Mr. Lincoln...

182
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,466
what do you hate?

183
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,670
I hate Jack Barts.

184
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,025
Then strike him down.

185
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,068
Well, clearly you don't
hate him that much.

186
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,346
Tell me what you hate.

187
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,189
I hate that my mother was taken away.

188
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,467
Inadequate.

189
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,264
I hate that we were afraid.

190
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,347
And?

191
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,940
That my mother and father,
everyone that we knew...

192
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,181
lived in fear.

193
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,587
Pathetic.

194
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,509
I hate that I was too small.

195
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,429
- Too weak.
- Yes.

196
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,144
- And that you failed...
- Yes!

197
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,466
- ... to protect her.
- Yes!

198
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,390
And that you let her die.

199
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,545
Power, Lincoln...

200
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,264
real power...

201
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,623
comes not from hate,
but from truth.

202
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,510
Before you protect others
from darkness...

203
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,510
you must first be able
to protect yourself.

204
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,670
Your enemies have the power
to render themselves invisible.

205
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,151
You must have the ability
to fight blind.

206
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,184
To see, without seeing.

207
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,750
Again.

208
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,865
In the weeks that followed...

209
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,429
Henry endeavored to impart a lifetime
of vampire-hunting secrets.

210
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,508
Their ability to adapt to sunlight.

211
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,305
Their power to render
themselves in visible.

212
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,947
But most of all,
he taught me how to destroy them.

213
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,222
When Judas betrayed Jesus...

214
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,071
his reward was 30 pieces of silver.

215
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,821
At that moment, those pieces
became a symbol of betraying God.

216
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,306
Of evil.

217
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,104
And silver became a curse...

218
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,911
upon the cursed.

219
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,704
You will never see a vampire
with silver on his person.

220
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,029
Nor see them reflected in mirrors.

221
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,951
The one thing God placed
beyond the reach of a vampire.

222
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,871
The one thing he can never possess.

223
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,947
Barts

224
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,664
And the only thing that
renders him powerless.

225
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,669
Henry, Jack Barts!

226
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,506
I give you the targets.
That was our deal.

227
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,543
This is not only
about Jack Barts.

228
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,869
Vadoma, a ruthless enforcer.

229
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,061
And her brother.

230
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,024
I've seen him before.

231
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,904
I saw him with Jack Barts.

232
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,307
They call him Adam.

233
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,941
He, from whom all others are made.

234
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,263
Vampires have been in
the New World for centuries.

235
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,941
Slaughtering native tribes
and early settlers.

236
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,861
But when the Europeans
arrived with their slaves...

237
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,628
the dead saw a sinister opportunity.

238
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,346
They built an empire in the South.

239
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,464
But, in recent years,
they pressed north...

240
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,469
leaving death in their wake.

241
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,149
It falls to us, Abraham...

242
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,028
the hunters,
to keep the balance.

243
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,503
To ensure that this remains
a nation of men...

244
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,506
and not monsters.

245
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,548
What we do,
we do not for one man...

246
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,141
but for the good of all mankind.

247
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,105
Henry sent me off into
the world with a reminder.

248
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,541
No attachments
No distractions.

249
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,788
No friends or family.

250
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,948
Besides, who could I trust?

251
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,145
Anyone in this well-mannered city
might very well be one of them.

252
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,751
Son of a bitch!

253
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,271
Lever see you here again,
I will have your balls as a coin purse!

254
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,908
Good afternoon, sir.
Joshua Speed at your service.

255
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,467
Abraham... Lincoln.

256
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,707
I need a bit of help.

257
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,981
All right.

258
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,786
Well, a friend in need
is a friend of Speed.

259
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,141
What can I get for you?

260
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,866
I don't suppose you know
of any rooms for rent, Mr. Speed?

261
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,064
What sort of room are
you looking for, Mr. Lincoln?

262
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,147
Well, a cheap one...

263
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,591
as I have spent all of my money
on law books

264
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,781
and have none to spare at the moment.

265
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,063
Now, as you say you have none,
am I to take your meaning as "cheap"...

266
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,181
or "free of charge"?

267
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,381
Well, on credit.

268
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,583
I don't think you'll find
such a room in Springfield.

269
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,306
People here are strangely
accustomed to being compensated.

270
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,547
Good day.

271
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,541
There is one room, Mr. Lincoln.

272
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,267
I was recently forced to pa rt ways
with a thieving prick of an associate...

273
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,701
and am, therefore,
in need of a replacement.

274
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,101
There's a room upstairs.

275
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,508
It isn't much, but I suppose
it could be had on credit...

276
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,748
if the tenant were willing
to work herein return.

277
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,341
Dear Henry...

278
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,464
life in Springfield is
less than desirous.

279
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,627
Fear not.

280
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,102
My pittance of a salary doesn't allow me
to deviate from your rules...

281
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,189
No friends, no family.

282
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,019
And certainly, no woman would find me,
and my existence, enticing.

283
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,305
Excuse me.

284
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,861
Excuse me,
I'll be needing these.

285
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,300
Just one second, ma'am.

286
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,581
Well, you needn't call me ma'am
as if I'm some haggard spinster..

287
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,067
I'm sorry, ma'am.

288
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,350
Madam... I mean, miss.

289
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,064
I'm Abraham... Lincoln.

290
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,231
Mary Todd.

291
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,627
Darling.

292
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,384
There you are.

293
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,466
You mustn't flit from
store to store so quickly.

294
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,311
Well, perhaps if you didn't stop to jaw
with every gentleman in Springfield...

295
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,751
I could say the same for you.

296
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,822
Stephen Douglas.
How do you do?

297
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,784
Abraham... Lincoln.

298
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,346
Are you a voting man, Mr. Lincoln?

299
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,661
L...

300
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,988
How do you feel about
keeping slavery out of Illinois?

301
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,306
I'm running for the legislature.

302
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,229
I'm sure he'd love to hear
your campaign speech...

303
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,069
but Mr. Lincoln was just about
to attend to my list.

304
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,705
We were talking, dear.

305
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,629
Slavery, it's a complicated issue.

306
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,425
I couldn't disagree with you more,
Mr. Douglas.

307
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,302
Mr. Douglas, Miss Todd.

308
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,106
You have met my new associate, Abraham.

309
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,506
A letter came for you.

310
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,786
Dear Abe.

311
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,631
Your prescription awaits you
at the local pharmacy.

312
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,141
Ask for Aaron Stibel, Junior.

313
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,944
Mr. Lincoln?

314
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,140
I'm so sorry.

315
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,467
Good day of work, Abraham.

316
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,741
Thank you.

317
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,943
But don't forget...

318
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,828
always have a contingency plan.

319
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,147
Aaron Stibel Junior?

320
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,267
Yes?

321
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,505
That's it. Oh, that's tight.

322
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,950
Don't worry.
It will only hurt for a second or two.

323
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,591
Did you eat today?

324
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,469
I had killed a monster.

325
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,389
And I would kill again.

326
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,461
But no amount of death?
could make me forget.

327
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,102
Merciful Christ, Lincoln,
what happened to your face?

328
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,426
Don't worry, I'll still be able to work.

329
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,507
Work?

330
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,901
To hell with work.

331
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,144
We got invited to a ball.

332
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,021
It could be your chance to save
Mary Todd from a life of boredom.

333
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,790
This suit makes me look ridiculous.

334
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,947
Nonsense.

335
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,821
But that hat makes you look ridiculous.
Come on.

336
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,547
Come on, come on.
Look, there she is.

337
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,071
Mr. Douglas, Joshua Speed.

338
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,989
Pleasure to see you.
Mary, you look lovely.

339
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,147
He's still missing.

340
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,227
Who's that?

341
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,341
Aaron Stibel.

342
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,427
Junior or Senior?

343
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,191
Junior.

344
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,669
- Who is that man?
- I don't know.

345
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,463
Mr. Douglas, you know Senator Nolan,
of course.

346
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,628
Yes, Stephen. Good to see you.

347
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,707
Have you heard this news?

348
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,948
Yes, we're looking into it.

349
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,949
Rest assured,
this kind of lawlessness...

350
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,540
won't stand
in the noble state of Illinois.

351
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,581
It's called a dance.

352
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,391
If we were meant to sit alone,
they would've called it something else.

353
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,704
Yes, I suppose they would have.

354
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,661
Come, Mr. Lincoln.

355
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,182
You'll ruin the upholstery
if you sit there any longer.

356
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,702
I'm sure you're a very nice man,
Mr. Lincoln...

357
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,788
but you're a...

358
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,506
A shopkeeper, in a borrowed suit.

359
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,749
No, it's not a matter of means.
Really, no.

360
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,784
I came to Springfield
looking for someone different.

361
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,871
Someone whose life
was a bit more adventurous, and well...

362
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,660
My apologies, I'm never this-

363
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,747
Honest?

364
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,827
Rude.

365
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,590
Miss Todd, may I speak candidly?

366
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,988
I, too, came here to better myself.

367
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,068
That's why I've taken an interest
in the law...

368
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:50,742
and why, if I may be so bold,
I have taken an interest in you.

369
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,831
And as for the adventure
that you seek...

370
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,784
I suspect that few men
could ever hope to provide that for you.

371
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,790
Least of all your fiancé
Stephen Douglas.

372
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,667
Mr. Lincoln, you are full of surprises.

373
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,505
Miss Todd, you have no idea.

374
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,381
Dear Abraham.

375
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,021
I've made a deposit at the local bank.

376
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,701
Be careful, it can quickly disappear.

377
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,431
Henry, there are more
than I ever thought possible.

378
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,664
Pharmacists, innkeepers, pastors.

379
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,103
It's more than a man can bear.

380
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,149
Well, I see I'm
such interesting company.

381
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,227
I'm sorry.

382
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,062
I've been working nights.

383
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,386
Really? Is that true?

384
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,108
Do you really want
to know the truth, Mary?

385
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,429
Each and every night...

386
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,104
I go out...

387
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,821
hunting vampires.

388
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,547
Well, how do you hunt these vampires?

389
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,904
With an axe.

390
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:10,061
A special silver axe, of course.

391
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,341
Of course.

392
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,501
And how many would
you reckon you've killed?

393
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,504
Five. No... six.

394
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,828
I have killed six vampires.

395
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,950
My goodness!

396
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,587
Abe!

397
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,020
Here I thought you were an honest man.
Really!

398
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,504
Well, I had a wonderful day, Abe.

399
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,309
As did I, Mary.

400
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,630
Miss Todd, you are a woman
of ravishing resourcefulness.

401
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,983
Mr. Lincoln, you have no idea.

402
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:23,031
You will have no friends, no family.

403
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:28,947
I... should be going. It's late.

404
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,186
Haw could I bring her into this world?

405
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,065
A world of demons, of danger.

406
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,671
Good night, then, Lincoln.

407
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,701
Good night, Mary.

408
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,021
Happy hunting.

409
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,151
If I truly cared for her...

410
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,941
the kindest thing I could do...

411
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,502
was walk a way.

412
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,741
This hunter
is another of Henry's disciples?

413
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,110
They say he's a madman.

414
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,743
I can't wait to meet him.

415
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,748
A stock boy, reading a law book.

416
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,864
What?
You studying to be a lawyer?

417
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,264
As a matter of fact, I am.

418
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,346
All right, what about a little test?

419
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,191
What's the law for free slaves
in the North?

420
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,667
According to the
Fugitive Slave Act of 1793...

421
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,466
enforcing Article four, section two,
of the United States Constitution...

422
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,504
"All runaway slaves must
be returned to their owners. "

423
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,067
However,
personal liberty laws state that...

424
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,670
"Anyone who is born free...

425
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,464
"cannot be taken under this act. "

426
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,264
I heard a good woman once say...

427
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,349
"Until all men are free...

428
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,985
"we're all slaves. "

429
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,101
Will?

430
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,628
Will Johnson!

431
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,906
How did you...?

432
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,465
I was back home...

433
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,946
and heard you moved here.

434
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,824
Studying to be a lawyer.

435
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,630
That's good.
I'm in need of a good lawyer.

436
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,385
What, are you in some kind of trouble?

437
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,901
I was freeing slaves down South
on the railroad...

438
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,064
hoping to find my brother down there.

439
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,989
Some bounty hunters got after me.

440
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,069
Said I was a runaway.

441
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,069
I need a writ, Abe...

442
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,546
saying I was born free.

443
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,587
You know, Will...

444
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,031
Come on.

445
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,506
Hey.

446
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,670
Speed, this is Will Johnson.

447
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,590
Will Johnson,
my oldest friend in the world.

448
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,071
The store isn't
going to run itself, Abe.

449
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:19,024
I'll have him back
as soon as possible, Mr. Speed.

450
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,301
I promise.

451
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,866
You're getting tall, Abe.

452
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,982
Look like you still
don't eat much, either.

453
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,829
You still afraid of the dark, too?

454
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,669
Not so much anymore.

455
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,624
That's him, Abe.

456
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,911
That's the guy that's been chasing me.

457
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,310
Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen...

458
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,991
I'm sure we can work this out.

459
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,422
Now I suggest you walk away, son.

460
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,505
No, sir, I suggest you do.

461
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,590
I've sent word to Senator Nolan.

462
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,430
He'll have you out soon.

463
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,827
You're far too kind, Miss Todd.

464
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,901
And he's far too ugly
to have a woman like you.

465
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,667
I think common-looking people
are the best in the world.

466
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,349
That's why the Lord
makes so many of them.

467
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,586
I just thank God he was there.

468
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,186
But I won't always be there.

469
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,667
Mary...

470
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,988
what if something was going on,
something terrible...

471
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:30,946
and you knew that there was no way
on earth that one man could stop it?

472
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,504
What would you do?

473
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,147
Well...

474
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,142
I wouldn't back away from what's right
just because it's hard.

475
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,467
My father used to say,
"Plant your feet and stand firm.

476
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,706
"The only question is
where to put your feet. "

477
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,468
We may fail in this fight.

478
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,425
We may only shatter
the tranquil veil of oppression...

479
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,951
but we must not be deterred!

480
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,948
For ours is a just and noble cause.

481
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,541
The cause of freedom.

482
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,550
The very cause upon which
our founding fathers built...

483
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,708
this great nation!

484
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,990
A voice like that is too strong
to be stuck keeping shop.

485
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,182
I'm actually studying to be a lawyer.

486
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,791
Well, Mr. Lincoln, maybe it's time
you thought about politics.

487
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,189
I can connect you with the right people.

488
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,064
Thank you, Senator Nolan.

489
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,311
- A pleasure young man.
- The same.

490
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,309
You're on your way, Mr. Lincoln.

491
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,830
I sent you to Springfield
to hunt vampires...

492
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,180
not to chase votes.

493
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,270
Lesson one,
always have a contingency plan.

494
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,666
If vampire hunting doesn't pan out...

495
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,191
I need a career to fall back on.

496
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,587
I'm being serious.

497
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,429
So am I, Henry.

498
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,668
I have done everything
you've asked of me.

499
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,749
Every letter, every name...

500
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,467
but never the letter I wait for,
and never the name I want most.

501
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,151
When do I get to kill Jack Barts?

502
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,747
Barts knows about Mary.

503
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,345
It's time.

504
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,427
Abraham...

505
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,867
Be careful.

506
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,951
Abraham-fucking-Linc"

507
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,021
Missed again!

508
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,507
I hope you're better with an axe
than you were with a gun.

509
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,346
Come on, Lincoln!

510
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,026
Catch me before I get to Mary.

511
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,308
Catch me if you can, boy!

512
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,464
There's thousands of us here.

513
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:48,066
He won't stop until
this whole country is ours.

514
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,942
And they be coming for you now.

515
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:56,465
Ask your friend, Henry.

516
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,429
You shut your mouth, you stupid whore.

517
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,146
Give me what I need,
or I'll knock your teeth out.

518
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,031
You lying son of a bitch.

519
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,781
God damn it!

520
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,141
No, Abe, stop!

521
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,621
You weren't ready to know.

522
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,390
What, that you are a vampire?

523
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,390
You are not the only one...

524
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,948
who has lost everything to vampires.

525
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,748
Just because the carriage stops...

526
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,710
doesn't mean we have to.

527
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,185
Get in the carriage.

528
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,506
Take this.

529
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,742
Run. Just run.

530
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,350
Henry!

531
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,585
Her soul was pure.

532
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,866
But yours, Henry...

533
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,584
It's one of God's little tricks.

534
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:48,708
Vampires cannot kill their own kind.

535
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,791
Only the living can kill the dead.

536
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,785
Welcome to the family.

537
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:13,828
You can't save the world,
and the ones you love, Lincoln.

538
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,102
You need to make a choice.

539
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,545
I'm sorry...

540
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,310
but goodbye.

541
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,747
Abe!

542
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,067
Mary!

543
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,545
What on earth are you doing?

544
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,510
Come on in.

545
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,110
- What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

546
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,187
Abe?

547
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,541
It's nothing.

548
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,863
Abe, I know when you're lying.

549
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,181
What are you hiding from me?

550
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,461
All right.

551
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:21,506
I didn't want to tell you this way.
This is not the way that I planned it.

552
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,065
But if you really must know...

553
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,189
Mary Todd...

554
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:41,109
will you make me the happiest of men?

555
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,825
And do you, Abraham...

556
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:12,625
promise to love her,
comfort her...

557
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:15,790
be honorable and honest
with her in all things...

558
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,664
in sickness and health...

559
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,828
till death do you part?

560
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:22,787
I do.

561
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,228
Then by the power vested
in me by almighty God...

562
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,830
in the great state of Illinois...

563
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,146
I now pronounce you...

564
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,065
man and wife.

565
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,511
You may kiss the bride.

566
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,147
Your mother would be so proud.

567
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,227
Thank you, Will.

568
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,546
I'm happy you could be here.

569
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,230
You're the only family I have.

570
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,706
Except for this one.

571
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,711
Congratulations.

572
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,786
May I introduce Mr. Henry Sturges.

573
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,584
My wife, Mary.

574
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,181
And my dear friend, Will Johnson.

575
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,667
Heavens, Mr. Sturges,
you're as chilly as the winter wind.

576
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:02,981
Henry, please.

577
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,909
I'm afraid that's a hazard
of carrying one's own bottle.

578
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,591
Well, you know what they say,
"Cold hands, warm heart. "

579
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,907
Yes, but I highly doubt that.

580
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,624
Mr. Sturges is a business associate.

581
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,504
Yes, I thought we
could talk a little business.

582
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:14,587
Of course.

583
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:15,941
If you'll excuse me.

584
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,061
What the hell are you doing here?

585
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,786
Be cautious, Abraham.

586
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:29,549
One forgets how easily we can lose
the most precious things.

587
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,589
They don't even know who I am.

588
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,984
Go upriver.

589
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:18,347
Invite this Mr. Lincoln
to join us at the plantation.

590
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:22,146
We're going to throw a ball
in his honor.

591
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,589
What makes you think he'll accept?

592
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:29,351
I think we can find a way to tempt him.

593
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,308
It's a good book. It's good.

594
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,101
Get him!

595
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,227
Abe.

596
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,341
We've got a problem.

597
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,227
They took Will.

598
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,145
What are you going to do?

599
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:08,185
I'm going to accept his invitation.

600
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:13,664
Speed deserved to know the truth
of what we were about to face.

601
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,343
I told him everything.

602
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:19,270
Not knowing if he would believe me
or think me mad.

603
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,431
Not knowing if he would have the courage
to face the monsters...

604
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,549
that

605
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:27,630
You and me, Abraham,
together we can accomplish anything.

606
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,820
There are no slaves.
Where are they?

607
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,022
I was just wondering that.

608
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,628
Something isn't right about this, Abe.

609
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,707
Yeah.

610
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,751
I don't know how to dance.

611
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:38,422
Don't worry, I'll teach you.

612
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:40,989
Wait here.

613
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,551
Ladies and gentlemen...

614
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,426
dinner is served.

615
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,509
Bravo, Mr. Lincoln.

616
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,741
Bravo.
You're even better than I'd heard.

617
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,987
A shame to sacrifice
so many of my best men...

618
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,830
but I needed to know
if you're up to the task.

619
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:50,430
What do you want with me?

620
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:53,305
To see you liberated.

621
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,310
To see you rise up
and destroy your oppressor.

622
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,787
That's interesting advice,
coming from a slave owner.

623
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,231
Men have enslaved each other...

624
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:03,389
since they invented gods
to forgive them for doing it.

625
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,829
I've seen Jews build Egypt's glory.

626
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,829
Seen Christians...

627
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:17,266
thrown to lions with my own eyes.

628
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:22,662
And I've seen Africans
sell their own kind to Europeans

629
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:27,548
May I share one of the revelations
of my 5,000 years?

630
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:31,150
We're all slaves to something.

631
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,430
I, to eternity.

632
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:36,590
You, to your convictions.
Others, to the color of their skin.

633
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,509
All I ever wanted...

634
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:42,227
was to see my kind
granted their rightful place.

635
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:47,226
But there are those of us,
those like your friend Henry...

636
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,827
who enjoy living in the dark.

637
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,985
And as you're doubtless aware...

638
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,104
I cannot personally destroy him,
nor he I.

639
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,350
You, Mr. Lincoln...

640
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:03,989
you could eliminate those
last pockets of resistance...

641
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,785
beginning with Henry Sturges himself.

642
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,429
All I ask...

643
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,546
is for you to break your chains.

644
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,266
Kill your master.

645
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,100
Be free.

646
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,382
And if I refuse?

647
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,109
Then you go on your merry way.

648
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:28,107
After I make you one of us, and...

649
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,502
spoon-feed you your friend.

650
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:36,264
Now, a simple "yes" or "no"
will suffice.

651
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,985
Kill Henry...

652
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:40,341
save your friend.

653
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:44,066
Feel free to take your time to decide.
Five...

654
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,267
four...

655
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,386
three...

656
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:49,947
two...

657
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:52,860
one.

658
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,466
Come on!

659
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:22,627
This way.

660
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,903
Miss Tubman, Miss Tubman.
We've been waiting for you.

661
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,187
Come quickly.

662
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,304
People getting killed every day.

663
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:17,146
Slaves disappearing.

664
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,542
Some people talk
about monsters and demons.

665
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,824
Good morning.
Good morning.

666
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:29,307
How can I assist you
on this beautiful day?

667
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,740
We're looking for three men.

668
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:33,147
You know, I did see someone
run down that way.

669
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,270
You're welcome to come in if you like.

670
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,030
Our service is about to begin.

671
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:43,420
Right, let's keep going.

672
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:54,909
I take it y'all came from up North?

673
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,387
Yes, ma'am.

674
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:59,060
Well, I suggest you get back there
as fast as you can.

675
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,345
There's a war coming.

676
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,187
A war for the soul of the country.

677
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,068
Going to be all colors of blood spilled.

678
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,151
Our nation was built
on the backs of slaves

679
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,310
Their labor, their blood.

680
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:18,151
More blood than
you could possibly imagine.

681
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:20,911
I have seen this
horror of the South firsthand.

682
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:24,821
I say the need for peace
outweighs the needs of the Blacks.

683
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:28,422
I say that if the people
of this great nation want slavery...

684
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,031
then let them have it.

685
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,791
The demon of slavery
is tearing our country apart.

686
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:36,911
We must stand up.
We must stand strong and fight.

687
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:40,661
Fight for the very soul of our nation.

688
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:44,262
Until every man is free,
we are all slaves!

689
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:50,231
You cannot take on slavery, Abraham.

690
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:52,024
You cannot take on the whole South!

691
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,541
- Why, because of Adam?
- No.

692
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,946
Are you afraid of him?

693
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:59,781
Because it is the only thing that has
kept them sated for all these years...

694
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,982
and you take that away,
then no one is safe.

695
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,228
So you get to choose
who lives and who dies.

696
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:06,267
A great man once said...

697
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,030
"What we do,
we do not for ourselves...

698
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:10,427
"not for one man,
but for the good of all mankind!

699
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,463
Not all mankind, Abraham.

700
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:13,866
Abe?

701
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,990
May I have my husband back?

702
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,822
He's all yours, Mrs. Lincoln.

703
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:26,669
Henry only saw the struggle his way.

704
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:30,666
But I began at last to see it another.

705
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:35,141
To see and to feel
the even greater issues at stake.

706
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:38,751
So, he and i would go our separate ways.

707
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:40,989
As the Bible says...

708
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:44,423
the time had come for me
to put aside childish things

709
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:46,909
I would fight not with an ax...

710
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:50,024
but with wards and ideals.

711
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:51,781
For a time...

712
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,141
they proved a stronger weapon.

713
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:06,789
Lincoln! Lincoln! Lincoln!

714
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:16,702
I appear before you to take,
in your presence...

715
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,949
the oath prescribed by
the Constitution of the United States...

716
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,903
to be taken by the president...

717
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:26,423
before he enters on
the execution of this office.

718
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:30,226
The question of slavery is better settled
with a pen than with a sword.

719
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,307
Fire!

720
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,626
Through twists of fate...

721
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:51,822
I found my self at 50 years of age...

722
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:56,343
the father of a nation that
was tearing itself apart...

723
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:58,668
while trying to be
the father to a bay...

724
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:01,943
not much older than I was
when I last my mother.

725
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,823
3,000 more dead.

726
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,784
When's the last time
you had something to eat?

727
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,186
I'm not hungry, thank you.

728
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:25,463
You have got to eat, Abe.
You're only human.

729
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,671
Come along, Willie.

730
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:38,741
Willie.

731
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,140
Willie.

732
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:00,821
If you do this,
there is no turning back, Abe.

733
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:03,385
I know.

734
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:08,024
I'm trying to protect the freedom
of a nation.

735
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:12,941
If this war is truly a stand
against evil...

736
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:15,427
then let it stand for something.

737
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,668
If it is a war for the freedom of man...

738
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,750
why not give all men
a reason to fight it?

739
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,908
"All persons held as slaves...

740
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,830
"within any state
or designated part of a state...

741
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:30,102
"the people whereof
shall be in rebellion

742
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:32,587
"against the United States
shall be then... "

743
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:36,068
"... and henceforward shall be free. "

744
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:46,265
Good morning.

745
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,226
Precious little one...

746
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:00,221
what's your name?

747
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:01,341
Willie.

748
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,423
And your father? What's his?

749
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,304
Abraham.

750
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:26,381
What a beautiful silver sword.

751
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:37,350
How is our little soldier faring?

752
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:51,349
I've never seen anything like it.

753
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:53,510
I'm sorry.

754
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,061
I don't know what ails your boy.

755
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:23,267
Abe.

756
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:26,830
Mary's calling for you.

757
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:51,700
I'm so sorry, Abraham.

758
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:57,386
Why didn't they take me?

759
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,668
Because they know...

760
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,308
it is a fate much worse than death.

761
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,301
Mary...

762
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:09,909
is inconsolable.

763
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,268
She says she doesn't want
to go on without him.

764
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:15,870
There is a way, Abraham.

765
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:19,467
You know that I can restore the dead.

766
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,906
Do it.

767
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:28,347
Do it.

768
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:29,747
Mary...

769
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:31,107
Do it!

770
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:35,190
Your journal...

771
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:38,628
the one you always
kept in your coat pocket...

772
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:42,584
I know I shouldn't have, Abe, but
I needed to know what you were hiding.

773
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,145
If what you say is true...

774
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:45,944
I beg you...

775
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:49,310
give us our little boy back.

776
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:53,986
Mary, he wouldn't be our little boy.

777
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:56,827
He would be something else,
something terrible.

778
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:58,590
Trust me, you don't want that.

779
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:00,669
You're asking me to trust you?

780
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,229
After you lied to me
for all these years.

781
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:05,786
I did it to protect you,
to protect our family.

782
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:06,981
And how did that work out?

783
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,948
You did this, Abe!

784
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:12,142
You did this!
You brought this on him!

785
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:13,910
You brought this on our boy!

786
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,140
Let me go to them.

787
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,109
Make a truce with Adam.

788
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:26,826
We must stop this war.
Willie's death is just the beginning.

789
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:28,669
Don't you dare say his name.

790
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:30,589
I warned you.

791
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,145
You didn't heed me.

792
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:35,504
How many more boys will have to die
before you listen to me?

793
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:47,342
These boys are dying in vain.

794
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:49,189
We should pull the troops back.

795
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:53,583
Abraham,
this war has cost us countless lives...

796
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,464
not to mention millions of dollars.

797
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:58,106
I thought we were going
to make this country great...

798
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,870
not tear it apart.

799
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:03,545
This is the only way
we can save the country now, Speed.

800
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,068
Send in troops.

801
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:17,630
Union troops are flooding
onto the field.

802
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,343
We are now outnumbered...

803
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:23,430
and ill-equipped compared to the North.

804
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:26,704
We will support you...

805
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,228
but you will need to support us.

806
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:31,866
No, thank you.

807
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:35,068
Rest assured, Mr. Davis...

808
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:38,590
you'll have as many of my kind
as you need.

809
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:01,146
Fire!

810
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:05,786
Fire!

811
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,749
Ready!

812
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:20,187
Aim!

813
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:24,941
Here they come!

814
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:27,907
Fire!

815
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,865
Why did they drop their rifles?

816
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:45,467
Fire!

817
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:25,782
It's the first day of Gettysburg.

818
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:28,784
It's been a disaster.

819
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,310
I don't think the army
can survive another.

820
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:36,022
If the rebels break through,
they'll be here... in days.

821
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:42,429
The generals think
we should evacuate Washington.

822
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,469
Run the war from New York or...

823
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:47,831
Boston, if need be.

824
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:49,784
You have to win this war.

825
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:54,109
If you don't, then all of it...

826
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:57,630
Then our son's death
will have been for nothing.

827
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,504
How can I win a war...

828
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:01,748
when I can't even protect my own family?

829
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:05,224
Our men have no way of defending
themselves against this enemy.

830
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:09,869
When our bullets are useless,
our bayonets are powerless as this fork!

831
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:11,107
This...

832
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:18,747
Will!

833
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:19,907
Speed!

834
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:23,547
This. This is what we need.

835
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:26,021
A fork.

836
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:27,541
Silver.

837
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,625
Okay, okay.

838
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:31,791
How much do we need?

839
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:33,860
All of it.

840
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:56,703
And why tell me this, Mr. Speed?

841
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:58,265
Why betray your friend?

842
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:01,862
He is my friend,
but I love this country even more.

843
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:06,310
And he, more than anyone, is responsible
for tearing this nation apart.

844
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:08,669
You've done the right thing.

845
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:13,471
I know.

846
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:17,944
32, 33, 34, 35...

847
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:21,228
That is a lot of silver, Abe.

848
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:27,308
Now, how are we going to
get all this there?

849
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:48,664
I'm sorry, Mary.

850
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:55,948
I'm sorry I've kept you in the dark
all these years.

851
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:03,227
I need you, Mary.

852
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:15,549
I've waited a long time
to hear you say those words.

853
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,904
I want you to leave Washington, Mary.

854
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:35,263
Miss Tubman,
please have some tea.

855
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:38,860
I very much appreciate you coming
to speak with me today.

856
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:40,346
Oh, yes.

857
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:43,547
Things have not been easy,
what with my...

858
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:46,141
The death of my son and the war.

859
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:49,063
I need to get out of Washington.

860
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:50,864
And I need a lot of help.

861
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:51,466
This war ends tonight.

862
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:57,064
And with it...

863
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:00,903
our millennia of darkness.

864
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:03,229
We have to do this on our own.

865
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,070
No one can know what's on that train.

866
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:07,786
If we don't get those weapons
to those boys at Gettysburg...

867
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:08,981
the war is over.

868
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,831
It's time we had a nation of our own.

869
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:20,906
Come...

870
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:23,668
we have a train to catch.

871
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:26,781
It's 80 miles from here to Gettysburg.

872
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:30,462
Eighty miles will decide whether
this nation belongs to the living...

873
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:32,586
or the dead.

874
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:03,103
Is everything all right, Speed?

875
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:07,102
I just can't believe
you're still writing in that book.

876
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:09,344
It's all in here, Speed.

877
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:10,780
The good with the bad.

878
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:33,227
What's this?

879
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:35,510
They're fleeing the nest.

880
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:38,307
Leaving Washington free for us.

881
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,506
Look at me.

882
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:57,588
I said look at me.

883
01:16:58,060 --> 01:16:59,141
Leave her.

884
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:01,350
Don't want to miss this train.

885
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,107
Let's go.

886
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:31,865
Henry, what the hell are you doing here?

887
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,142
I just wanted to see
how far your foolishness would take you.

888
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:35,386
I don't have time to argue!

889
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,502
I didn't come here to argue with you.

890
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:41,181
I came here to tell you that
your dear friend Speed back there...

891
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:42,506
is a traitor.

892
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:46,587
He betrayed you, Abe.
Speed is leading you-

893
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,429
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

894
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:55,344
That's all according to plan.

895
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:43,590
You must get off this train.

896
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,543
No, you must get off this train.

897
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:47,628
This is not your war, Henry.

898
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:28,741
They're here, Abe.

899
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:29,907
A whole heap of them.

900
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,711
We can't let them stop this train.

901
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:33,140
You go through there
and you're dead.

902
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:35,510
Get out now,
it's your last chance.

903
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:40,827
Did you load that thing?

904
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,183
We've got to keep them
away from the locomotive.

905
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:41,188
Why don't you let him go, Lincoln?

906
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:43,348
Emancipate yourselves.

907
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:44,951
I will never follow you.

908
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:47,302
You don't have to follow me, Abe.

909
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,229
I have the train.

910
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:50,785
I have the silver.

911
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:53,108
Soon I'll have the whole country.

912
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:57,100
I'm going to destroy
the myth of Abraham Lincoln...

913
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:59,826
so that history will forever know you
not as a man...

914
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:02,184
but as a monster!

915
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:04,709
Lincoln set us up.

916
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:06,866
We've been tricked, Adam.

917
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:10,184
There is no silver on this train.

918
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:30,227
Abe!

919
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:40,226
Abe!

920
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:43,311
Abe!

921
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:58,145
Hello, Speed.

922
01:24:58,740 --> 01:24:59,946
Where is the silver?

923
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:01,027
Silver?

924
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:03,587
Should be here.

925
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:05,270
Why did you lie to me?

926
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:08,630
To get you all in one place...

927
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:09,981
to finish you.

928
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:11,341
Speed?

929
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:14,630
No!

930
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:14,783
Mr. President!

931
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:18,421
There is nowhere left to run, Lincoln.

932
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:21,420
Where is it?

933
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:23,031
Where is the silver?

934
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:28,621
Right here!

935
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:09,141
Thank you, Henry.

936
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:15,021
I suppose some vampires can be trusted.

937
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:17,942
As can some men, Abraham.

938
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:21,469
If the train was a decoy...

939
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:23,781
where is the silver?

940
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:26,709
This isn't the only railroad.

941
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:31,666
A wise man once taught me...

942
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:34,943
always have a contingency plan.

943
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:40,381
Get me more!

944
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:42,628
Bayonets.
Bayonets for Springfield muskets.

945
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:44,265
Springfield muskets!

946
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:48,500
Five-pounders and grenades are in
the second wagon in the back.

947
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:49,860
Go now, go now.

948
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:45,427
Fire!

949
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:58,462
Four score and seven years ago...

950
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:01,590
our fathers brought forth
an this continent...

951
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:05,341
a new nation conceived in liberty...

952
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:07,747
and dedicated to the proposition...

953
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:11,786
that all men are created equal.

954
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:15,430
Now we are engaged
in a great civil war...

955
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:18,863
testing whether that nation
or any nation...

956
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:21,381
so conceived and so dedicated...

957
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,707
can long endure.

958
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:31,545
It is for us, the living, rather...

959
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:33,469
to be dedicated here...

960
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:37,107
to the unfinished work
which they who fought here...

961
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:39,780
have thus far so nobly advanced.

962
01:30:40,540 --> 01:30:43,350
It is rather for us
to be here dedicated...

963
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:46,589
to the great task remaining before us...

964
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:50,705
that from these honored dead we take
increased devotion to that cause...

965
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:54,541
for which they gave
the last full measure of devotion...

966
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:57,906
that we here highly resolve
that these dead...

967
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:00,865
shall not have died in vain...

968
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:03,791
and that this nation, under God...

969
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:06,551
shall have a new birth of freedom...

970
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:07,821
and that government...

971
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:12,867
of the people, by the people,
for the people...

972
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:16,549
shall not perish from the earth.

973
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:32,629
Our enemies have made their exodus.

974
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:34,700
Some back to Europe...

975
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:37,869
some to South America and the Orient.

976
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:42,503
They've seen that America shall
forever be a nation of living men...

977
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:46,350
a nation of free men.

978
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:50,227
We make rather a good team,
you and I.

979
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:54,064
One can't help but think of all the good
we could do if we had more time.

980
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:56,267
Limitless time.

981
01:31:56,380 --> 01:31:57,347
Lincoln!

982
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:01,943
Yes, well, time waits for no man.

983
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:03,984
We're going to be late for the theatre.

984
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:09,983
Hold onto this for me, Henry.

985
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:18,665
Mary, darling...

986
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:21,148
have you seen my hat?

987
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:23,502
It's on your desk in the office.

988
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:27,470
Have you seen my hat?

989
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:30,231
Abraham, let me make you immortal.

990
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:32,024
Let us fight through the ages,
side by side.

991
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:34,347
Vampires are not
the only things that live forever.

992
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:55,344
History prefers legends to men.

993
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:59,104
It prefers nobility to brutality.

994
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:02,231
Soaring speeches to quiet deeds.

995
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:05,306
History remembers the battle...

996
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:07,184
and forgets the blood.

997
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:11,502
However history remembers me,
if it does at all...

998
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:16,791
it shall only rem ember
a fraction of the truth.

999
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:41,981
One more.

1000
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:49,346
A guy only gets that drunk when
he wants to kiss a girl or kill a man.

1001
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:52,511
So, which is it?
