[Clears Throat]
How, uh-- How did you ladies
end up out here anyway?

310
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:55,178
Well, Officer,
it's quite a story.

311
00:25:55,287 --> 00:26:00,088
See, my sisters and I
are members of
the Sacred Girls Virgin Choir...

312
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:02,091
out in Sand Dab,
Arizona.

313
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:05,185
We were supposed to
perform a cantata today
out in Mojave.

314
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,026
Since we were
so far from home,

315
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:11,728
the local parish director
kindly suggested that
we stay as his guests.

316
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:17,138
Well, after we were all snuggled
into our one little bed
for the night,

317
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,177
we heard loud music and
laughter coming from outside.

318
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:23,304
We peeked our heads out
only to discover
the entire congregation...

319
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:29,320
dancing and-and laughing
and smoking something that
may not have been tobacco.

320
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,651
They tried to fondle
our num-nums...

321
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:35,055
and even convinced Bambi Lynn
to shoot Communion wafers
out of her--

322
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,722
Anyway, we got out
and ran to our car,
but they chased us.

323
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:41,355
Well, thank the Lord
Cheyenne can drive...

324
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,798
and Bambi Lynn can gyrate
because we lost 'em!

325
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:48,965
By then, well,
it was 3:00 a.m.
and-and dark.

326
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,974
And we were scared.

327
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:54,307
And someone's not very good
with directions.

328
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:57,279
And, well,
we ended up out here.

329
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:02,752
And now,
if you can believe it,
our car's dead.

330
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:11,385
I see.
We tried to jump her,

331
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:15,227
but we just couldn't
get her off.

332
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:19,394
That's why we're
all dirty and desperate.

333
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:24,203
You must think
the worst of us.
No. [Laughs] Don't be silly.

334
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,277
I already
called the tow company,

335
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:29,609
and they're
on their way, Deputy...

336
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,682
Fucks.

337
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:37,554
Fuchs. It's, uh--
[Clears Throat] Fuchs, ma'am.

338
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,419
Oh.
[Giggles]
Oops.

339
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,860
You know,
let me take a look at her.

340
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,192
Sometimes you just got
to know how to finger
these old beauties.

341
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:50,529
- That won't be necessary.
- Why not?

342
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,694
What happened to your hand?

343
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,970
- Cut it on my crucifix.
- You know what?

344
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:05,607
The towing company already
made us post a $200 deposit
for coming out here.

345
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,708
Said they'd arrive by noon.

346
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,879
Maybe I can save you
that money. Hmm?

347
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:25,327
Oh. Yeah, they
don't make 'em
like this anymore.

348
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:28,804
Nowadays, it's all
computers and sensors.

349
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:31,171
Got to work at NASA
just to change the oil.

350

[Chuckles]

351
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,655
[Clears Throat]
All right, uh,
turn the key, please.

352
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:01,595
See? Nothing.

353
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:04,641
That's odd. It, uh,
must be the starter.

354
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,333
You know what?
[Sighs]

355
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,802
Sometimes these old cars
have tool kits
along with the jacks.

356
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,634
You can't!

357
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,807
You can't!

358
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,073
Why not?
Be-Because--

359
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,342
Because the trunk lock
is rusted out.

360
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,044
Hasn't opened in years.

361
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:56,860
- You okay, miss?
- She'll be fine.

362
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,929
She's still upset
about last night.

363
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,998
Those choirboys
tried to defile her.

364
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:06,861
Listen, you've been
so helpful and kind.

365
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,405
The least I can do is come
back here and cook for you.

366
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:12,237
Say, dinner Friday?

367
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:14,868
It's a--
[Clears Throat]

368
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:22,285
It's a tempting offer, but,
uh, I'll, uh, tell you what.

369
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:25,720
I'll-I'll swing back around
later, make sure, uh,
you ladies got away safely.

370
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,724

I bet you he's
calling us in right now.

375
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:54,975
We should have told him.
He looked like a nice guy.

376
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,418

He doesn't suspect a thing.

383
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:35,282
 That every month for four
to six days I can't spend 

384

 It's only a deception

 She'd never reveal

 It's only her illusion

 I come to your conclusion

 The devil don't care
'cause he's already
been there

 Don't love her

any better than just being

I've got a better one
for you, princess.

Hmm. Either
a bumper car three-way

a regrettable miscalculation.

939
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:47,532
But tac-comm has learned
of another opportunity
to retrieve the nano-swarm.

940
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:53,507
I'm sending you
to Honey Junction
Women's Prison...

941
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:56,270
to infiltrate and make contact
with a former colleague
of Mortimer Gage.

942
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:58,346
She goes by an alias,
Camero.

943
01:21:58,446 --> 01:22:00,471
I'm on it.

944
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:04,382
Good. Now, bury all evidence
and get yourself home.

Oh, my God.

01:22:30,478 --> 01:22:32,639
You're a wicked-cool
covert operative...

949
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:35,614
masquerading
as a sex-toy tycoon?

950
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:38,376
Mm-hmm.

951
01:22:40,322 --> 01:22:43,314
My mission
was to reclaim that--

952
01:22:43,425 --> 01:22:45,359
a weaponized vial
of synthetic nano-swarm...

953
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:48,190
that Gage hijacked
from a C.I.A. convoy.

954
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:51,390
It's filled with trillions
of self-replicating
robo-viruses...

955
01:22:51,499 --> 01:22:54,935
that latch on to
any living organism
and suck the carbon out...

956
01:22:55,036 --> 01:22:59,564
till you, me,
even the cockroaches are
nothing more than gray goo.

957
01:22:59,674 --> 01:23:03,075
It could wipe out
an entire continent
if properly deployed.

958
01:23:03,178 --> 01:23:05,703
I had to extricate it
before Gage tried, again,

959
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:09,215
to sell it to another
combatant country
or crazed libertarian.

960
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:14,186
So the plan,
the diamonds, us...

961
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:16,917
was all just a crock?

962
01:23:17,025 --> 01:23:21,052
No. Not us, Trix.

963
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:24,962
What I am doesn't change
how I feel about you.

964

Everything
between us is real.

01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:32,068
You've changed me.

966
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:35,968
Made me see a life
I've been missing.

967

just walk away
from Flesh Force Foxy...

and a hi-dee-ho.

01:23:50,592 --> 01:23:53,152
I needed leverage
and a huge bankroll.

972
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:55,821
The vial
and the diamonds
give us both.

973
01:23:57,632 --> 01:24:03,571
Now you, Lily and me
can slip off to a small
Micronesian island together...

forever.
