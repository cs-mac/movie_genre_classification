1
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:09,107
When shall I pick you up, sir?

2
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:14,648
Give me time for a couple of cocktails.
Say, half an hour.           - Yes, sir.

3
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:17,999
Mrs Farnsworth asks me to remind you
you have a dinner engagement tonight.

4
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,816
Well, a half-hour will just give
me time to change and make it.

5
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:24,713
By the way .. did Mrs Farnsworth
mention with whom we are dining?

6
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:28,093
With the Lindens, sir.
- Oh, the Lindens.

7
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:31,406
You'd better make it an hour, Williams.

8
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:34,645
I find I'll need more
cocktails than I thought.

9
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:50,620
I beg your pardon .. but
aren't you Joyce Heath?

10
00:01:51,982 --> 00:01:53,372
No.
- But I ..

11
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,024
You've made a mistake.

12
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,080
Perhaps I have .. pardon me.

13
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:11,855
Gentlemen.

14
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:14,353
How are you Mr Farnsworth?
- Evening, Roger.

15
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:18,907
Anthony, a Sidecar, with just a
splash more brandy than necessary.

16
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:22,690
I suppose you know what brandy
does to your liver, Roger.

17
00:02:22,962 --> 00:02:25,348
Yes. That's why I stopped
port and turned to brandy.

18
00:02:25,564 --> 00:02:28,221
Your liver is far less
conspicuous than your nose.

19
00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:31,715
Do you chaps remember
an actress Joyce Heath?

20
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,379
I'll never forget her
as Camille .. Sappho.

21
00:02:35,586 --> 00:02:37,678
I saw her only once,
but I'll never forget her.

22
00:02:38,344 --> 00:02:40,872
What a vitally tempestuous
creature she was.

23
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:44,795
It's amazing how powerfully a personality
can project itself across the footlights.

24
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,439
That night I was in
the rear of the theater.

25
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:49,827
Yet couldn't have been closer
if I'd held her in my arms.

26
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:51,705
Not closer perhaps,
but more interesting.

27
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,418
Quiet .. let the gentleman confess.

28
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:55,965
Joyce Heath never knew it.

29
00:02:56,162 --> 00:02:59,442
But she prompted me to make a decision
that changed the course of my whole life.

30
00:03:00,985 --> 00:03:04,385
The career my family planned for
me in Wall Street I discarded.

31
00:03:04,938 --> 00:03:06,995
I suddenly got the urge to create.

32
00:03:07,427 --> 00:03:10,319
I gave up writing as I couldn't write,
and music because I couldn't play.

33
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,746
But I could draw ..

34
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:14,007
Three years in Paris taught me ..

35
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,684
Not defeat .. but compromise.

36
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:19,821
I still had enough of the urge
left to try architecture.

37
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,032
I saw her tonight, just as I came in.

38
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:26,983
Dowdy, down and out .. and
ashamed of being Joyce Heath.

39
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:28,946
She was tops.

40
00:03:30,204 --> 00:03:32,438
What's the matter, Mr Hanley?
Isn't the Highball right?

41
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:36,607
Oh .. the Highball. Yes, perfect .. why?

42
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,623
Well, you looked as if
something tasted or smelt bad.

43
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:42,797
I would rather you wouldn't mention
that. I was reading my own column.

44
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:45,321
Ted.
- Yeah?

45
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:47,149
We want to ask you something.

46
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,574
Yes, it's a toupee.

47
00:03:51,628 --> 00:03:54,316
What about Joyce Heath? She was a star.

48
00:03:55,179 --> 00:03:57,842
She was too brilliant.
Too startling for a star.

49
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:00,612
She was a comet, which
appeared suddenly ..

50
00:04:00,837 --> 00:04:03,602
Fell spectacularly, and
disappeared completely.

51
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,030
That gentlemen, is a metaphor. One of
the great actresses .. and Joyce Heath.

52
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:10,963
That's why I can't read his
column. He writes that way, too.

53
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:13,443
Yes, but what happened to her, Ted?

54
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:16,959
Fantastic as it may sound .. a jinx.
One she put on other people.

55
00:04:17,311 --> 00:04:18,213
A jinx?

56
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:21,530
It started when her leading man
was killed on an opening night.

57
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,107
From then on .. everyone associated with
her was haunted by failures, divorces ..

58
00:04:27,586 --> 00:04:28,732
Suicides and scandals.

59
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,765
That's right. She practically
lived on the front page.

60
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:35,715
At first, she laughed at the
superstition .. then she believed it.

61
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,274
Last time I saw her, she was
on a cheap Vaudeville tour.

62
00:04:39,771 --> 00:04:42,827
Then she vanished.
Like the magician's lady.

63
00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:46,169
Sounds almost unbelievable, doesn't it.

64
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,883
But it happened.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,365
Well, I've got to break into a trot if I
want to change and pick up Gail in time.

66
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:57,398
We have a dinner date.
- The Lindens?

67
00:04:57,849 --> 00:04:58,788
The Lindens.

68
00:04:58,995 --> 00:05:02,200
I think they get most of their guests
from the tomb of Ramses The Second.

69
00:05:02,722 --> 00:05:05,042
There's quite a few valuable
Civil-War relics among them, too.

70
00:05:05,712 --> 00:05:06,904
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

71
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:08,129
A clever boy, that.

72
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:10,012
One of the best architects
in the country.

73
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:13,712
With his reputation and Gail Armitage
connections, he'll come out alright.

74
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:17,270
By the way, when are they to be married?
- It hasn't been arranged, yet.

75
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:18,610
How do you know?

76
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:22,810
Mrs Farnsworth hasn't heard.
- Maybe they're keeping it a secret?

77
00:05:23,317 --> 00:05:25,317
What, from my wife? Impossible.

78
00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:38,455
Good evening, Cato.
- Good evening.

79
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:43,813
I'm late, Cato. You'd better draw me a
bath, lay out my dinner jacket and ..

80
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:45,439
Never mind the bath.

81
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:49,157
Did you ever try putting celluloid fish
in the tub to entice him into it, Cato?

82
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,138
Gail, what are you doing here?

83
00:05:51,345 --> 00:05:54,424
I finished early, so I came over to save
you the trouble of driving out to get me.

84
00:05:54,707 --> 00:05:55,974
Good for you.

85
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,417
Uh, Cato .. stew up a cocktail.

86
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:01,549
I don't want a cocktail, thank you.

87
00:06:01,868 --> 00:06:04,901
Well, some hors d'oeuvres, Cato.
- They always spoil my dinner.

88
00:06:05,888 --> 00:06:09,345
Cato, you fix the young lady a ham
sandwich whether she wants it or not.

89
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,373
Gail, what do you think?
- That I love you.

90
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,382
Well, I'm pretty fond of
myself this evening.

91
00:06:18,514 --> 00:06:20,429
The bank is going to
make the building loan.

92
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:23,236
Don, how marvelous!
- Miraculous is the word.

93
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:25,743
All I have to do is put a
hundred thousand in escrow.

94
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:27,781
But they could let you
have the land now.

95
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:30,353
Don't worry about the petty cash.
It will come out alright.

96
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,930
Think of starting on those estates,
after dreaming about them for years.

97
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,911
I know exactly how
they're going to look.

98
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,301
Unless I fall down, they'll be the most
beautiful estates in the whole country.

99
00:06:40,072 --> 00:06:43,888
And I can't fall down. I've worked too
hard, I've waited too long to flop.

100
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:46,729
It seems as though it's all going
to come through, doesn't it.

101
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:51,343
I guess we have everything, young lady.
- And best of all, we have us.

102
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,231
Ham sandwich please.

103
00:06:57,052 --> 00:06:59,221
No mustard.
- No mustard?

104
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:01,944
No mustard.
- Cato, go look for some mustard.

105
00:07:02,257 --> 00:07:05,590
If you find any and bring it here, you'll
go out of here looking like a hot-dog.

106
00:07:09,391 --> 00:07:11,928
Happy?
- Ecstatically.          - Why?

107
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:17,509
Because dear, I have a very good sense.
- You ineffable cad, you.

108
00:07:18,142 --> 00:07:20,210
You adorable darling, you.

109
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:24,893
You must hurry and get dressed
or we'll be late for the Lindens.

110
00:07:25,081 --> 00:07:27,823
Can't we get out of it somehow?
- No, we cannot.

111
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:30,515
You'll meet a lot of people there
who can afford to buy your houses.

112
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:33,929
People who go to the Lindens don't
need houses, they need tombs.

113
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,246
[ meow ]

114
00:07:47,443 --> 00:07:50,213
[ woof, woof ]

115
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:56,518
Gail and I couldn't stand it any longer.

116
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,774
Being the extra man at a Linden party
is like being a spare corpse at a wake.

117
00:08:01,245 --> 00:08:03,130
I could kiss you for
getting us out of there.

118
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,186
I could too, if you didn't look so much
like a horse that threw me once.

119
00:08:06,844 --> 00:08:08,980
Be exact. There have been so many.

120
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,440
Delightful women you take
up with. What shall we do?

121
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,104
You know what I'd like to do?
- Steal a water melon?

122
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:17,289
Paint moustaches on a library lion.

123
00:08:17,522 --> 00:08:20,104
One of you are bound to say
something rude if this goes on.

124
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:23,052
I'd like to go to the shooting
galleries and Honky-Tonks and things.

125
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:24,357
An idea.

126
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:27,513
I'll send my driver home,
and we'll all go in your car.

127
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,821
No you won't. I've got a tough day
tomorrow. I want to get up early.

128
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:34,835
I don't want to spend tonight escorting
you in, and carrying you out of a club.

129
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:37,530
Say, listen. I've never been
carried to any place in my life.

130
00:08:38,123 --> 00:08:41,108
Thrown, yes .. but carried, never.

131
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:10,011
Come on, let's not go home. Let's go
in there and try some bird's nest soup.

132
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,453
How about a little high
class sharp-shooting?

133
00:09:12,857 --> 00:09:15,002
A harbor for flotsam and
jetsam. A bit of O'Henry's.

134
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,392
You win.

135
00:09:28,015 --> 00:09:31,238
A smart looking place.
- Who's idea was this?

136
00:09:32,346 --> 00:09:33,719
You can sit here.

137
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:36,083
I guess we'd better stand at the bar.

138
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:39,143
You'd better sit where
he tells you to, dear.

139
00:10:01,237 --> 00:10:03,994
Oh Don, this is such a depressing place.
- You don't want to stay?

140
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,237
No, let's get out of here. Come on.

141
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:10,914
Some other time.

142
00:10:16,956 --> 00:10:19,635
Well, you can chalk one up against
me. I certainly can pick them.

143
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:22,085
Now where?

144
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,583
Oh, it's after 12 o'clock.
Don's got to get to bed.

145
00:10:25,853 --> 00:10:28,001
He's been working like a Trojan lately.

146
00:10:28,353 --> 00:10:31,290
Why don't you go on with Teddy.
Let him take you home.

147
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,676
It would save me an hour,
getting out and back.

148
00:10:35,075 --> 00:10:36,124
Do you mind, Teddy?

149
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:39,486
No, not if he don't talk about Don.
- Alright. Why don't you do it then?

150
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,627
I think I will. I've an early meeting in
the morning. I'll call you after that.

151
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:45,469
Don't forget.
- No.

152
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,427
Listen, you're coming to the club to
see me play Polo next week aren't you?

153
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:52,312
Well, you mean to see the horse
play and you get tired? I might.

154
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:55,355
Goodnight.
- Goodnight, darling.

155
00:10:55,716 --> 00:10:57,242
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

156
00:11:34,748 --> 00:11:36,514
Do you mind if I sit down?

157
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,326
Not if you buy a drink.
- Two of whatever the lady is drinking.

158
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:41,959
Straight gin.

159
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,815
I've seen you before.
- Which doesn't make us old friends.

160
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:55,148
Well you see, one time, I ..

161
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:58,517
It really doesn't interest me,
if you don't mind.

162
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:03,306
Thanks.

163
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:05,745
Not at all.

164
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:10,481
Rather ironical, isn't it?

165
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:13,829
Are you going to drink that?

166
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,298
Haven't you had enough?

167
00:12:18,858 --> 00:12:19,928
Quite enough.

168
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:29,371
Goodnight Joyce Heath.

169
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:35,813
What did you say?
- Joyce Heath.

170
00:12:37,128 --> 00:12:38,414
I ..

171
00:12:39,644 --> 00:12:41,400
Joyce Heath, the actress ..

172
00:12:41,735 --> 00:12:45,287
Sitting in a dive like this
swilling down cheap gin.

173
00:12:46,586 --> 00:12:48,112
You must be drunk, too.

174
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,328
No, there isn't much similarity
except in appearance.

175
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:54,005
Lots of people look alike.

176
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,273
Joyce Heath was full of life.

177
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:59,909
I'll never forget the time I saw
her. She was playing Juliet.

178
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:06,150
Do you remember the scene where you
were told you had to marry Count Paris?

179
00:13:06,423 --> 00:13:10,045
And you took the sleeping draught to
pretend death until Romeo's return?

180
00:13:11,348 --> 00:13:14,019
As your mother kissed you
goodnight .. and left you.

181
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:20,749
You began: "farewell, God knows
when we shall meet again".

182
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:26,265
Farewell .. God knows
when we shall meet again.

183
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,785
A faint, cold fear thrills my veins.

184
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:36,630
And almost freezes out the heat of life.

185
00:13:40,282 --> 00:13:42,282
I shall call them back to comfort me.

186
00:13:44,598 --> 00:13:45,644
Nurse.

187
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:49,071
What should she do here?

188
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:53,645
My needs must act my dismal scene alone.

189
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:57,738
Come vial.

190
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:02,301
What if this mixture do not work?

191
00:14:03,764 --> 00:14:06,769
Shall I, by force, be
married to the Count?

192
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:09,155
No.

193
00:14:11,193 --> 00:14:13,108
No .. this shall ..

194
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,644
This shall ..

195
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:22,076
Passed out?

196
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:27,043
I'll call the wagon. They'll throw
her in the tank until the morning.

197
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,639
Waiter.

198
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:31,569
I'll take her home.

199
00:14:32,217 --> 00:14:35,689
Okay buddy. Pay me twenty cents
for them two drinks and she's yours.

200
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,941
Keep the change, boss?
- Yes.

201
00:14:43,157 --> 00:14:44,199
Okay.

202
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:36,469
[ door knocks ]

203
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:39,075
Yes?

204
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:48,183
You look poorly.

205
00:15:49,451 --> 00:15:53,069
Then it won't surprise you to be
told that I <i>feel</i> poorly.        - No.

206
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:56,488
Figuring the moist condition
you arrived in last night.

207
00:15:57,099 --> 00:16:00,299
And just where did I arrive? I'm not
asking you to betray a confidence.

208
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,300
This is Mr Bellows' place.
He's an architect.

209
00:16:04,995 --> 00:16:07,729
One of them fellows that draws pictures.
- Thank you.

210
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:12,316
I suppose you are Mrs Bellows?
Or are you just one of his sketches?

211
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:17,190
Nope .. I'm his housekeeper for when
he comes down here weekends.

212
00:16:18,234 --> 00:16:22,364
How cozy. And Mr Bellows, where is he?
- He's having breakfast.

213
00:16:22,912 --> 00:16:26,518
And if you want to see him, you better
look perky. He's got to get to town.

214
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,412
I'm looking forward
to seeing Mr Bellows.

215
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,760
Watch out.
- Leave me alone!

216
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:36,652
No, I wasn't going to push you ..
- Do you mind leaving me alone!

217
00:16:36,793 --> 00:16:38,944
Nope .. in fact, I'd like it.

218
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,237
Well, she's up.

219
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,215
Oh .. I bet the Mahoney boys are
having a parade for her this morning.

220
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,634
There wasn't no-one in her room.

221
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,257
I don't know the Mahoney boys anyhow.

222
00:17:03,746 --> 00:17:06,534
You never heard of the Mahoney Boys?
You are very fortunate.

223
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:11,886
They're little men with beards who play
tunes on your teeth with one hand ..

224
00:17:12,082 --> 00:17:14,354
And keep time with mallets
inside your head with the other.

225
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:17,304
At the same time they run around your
stomach planting jumping beans.

226
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,539
You wouldn't be pulling my
leg would you Mr Bellows?

227
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,553
Please .. Mrs Williams.

228
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:42,800
Feeling better?
- I'd like a drink.

229
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,132
Before breakfast?

230
00:17:46,045 --> 00:17:47,195
Get me a drink!

231
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:00,941
Why don't you lay off that stuff?

232
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:02,965
Because I'd rather be drunk than sober.

233
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:06,274
I gathered that last night.
- Last night?

234
00:18:07,258 --> 00:18:09,217
Oh, you must be quite
proud of your conquest.

235
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:11,645
You are very wrong. You see I ..

236
00:18:11,814 --> 00:18:14,162
Don't bother with alibis.
It really doesn't matter.

237
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,593
You are a perfect alibi.

238
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:21,342
Take a look at yourself. Take
a good look. Drunken. Ill-kept.

239
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,438
The only feeling you can arouse
in a man is pity.              - Pity?

240
00:18:25,793 --> 00:18:28,406
Pity? You dare feel sorry for me!

241
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:31,258
You with your fat little
soul and your smug face.

242
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:34,256
Picking your way so cautiously
through a pastel existence.

243
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:37,050
Why, I've lived more in a day
than you'll ever dare live.

244
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:41,838
Pity for me? That's very funny, when
I've never had any for men like you.

245
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,908
You know, just now you are
as I imagined you would be.

246
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,969
Playing a second act
speech in a third-act coat.

247
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,732
When you boast to your friends
about seeing me here ..

248
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,528
I shouldn't mention that
I've become a has-been.

249
00:18:59,408 --> 00:19:02,388
It would detract frightfully from
the glamour of your adventure.

250
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,165
Now look here Miss Heath, the
reason I brought you here ..

251
00:19:05,315 --> 00:19:08,745
I know. Because you were sorry
for me .. you've already said that.

252
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:13,790
No .. because I was grateful to you for
something very important in my life.

253
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:18,616
I suppose you always loved the theater.
- It was more than that.

254
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:23,229
The beauty and fineness of one of your
performances moved me so strongly ..

255
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:25,529
That the whole pattern
of my life was altered.

256
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:30,734
I've had plenty to be grateful for, but
first I owe you my deepest gratitude.

257
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:32,744
Well?

258
00:19:35,278 --> 00:19:37,683
Then I am humiliated to the
point where I must thank you.

259
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:50,333
Breakfast .. breakfast ..

260
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:54,469
Oh .. smoking before breakfast.

261
00:19:55,573 --> 00:19:58,939
You'll spoil your appetite.
- Being here already has.

262
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,539
Restful here, isn't it.

263
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:17,528
The whole countryside
seems to have found peace.

264
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,245
A person could find peace, too.
- No.

265
00:20:22,353 --> 00:20:25,623
You only find that in yourself, and when
you do, you might as well be dead.

266
00:20:26,027 --> 00:20:27,041
Dead?

267
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,953
"Rest In Peace" is for tombstones.

268
00:20:30,806 --> 00:20:32,094
And for the living?

269
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,275
Desire .. to want something ..

270
00:20:35,643 --> 00:20:38,116
You'll tame that desire and
live up to every moment of it.

271
00:20:38,984 --> 00:20:41,242
And then go on leaving yesterday behind.

272
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:44,022
On and on .. higher and higher.

273
00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:51,030
Frustrated actress reads
lines for small audience.

274
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:55,075
You could go on .. talent
like yours doesn't die.

275
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:58,592
You were a star once, you can be again.

276
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:01,012
Uhuh .. an evil star, a jinx.

277
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:03,644
You better run for your life.

278
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:08,466
You can't possibly believe that
silly theatrical superstition.

279
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,349
Well, two men who loved me
are dead, some financially ruined.

280
00:21:13,035 --> 00:21:14,060
Shows have folded.

281
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:16,979
How can I possibly ignore it when
producers won't give me parts?

282
00:21:17,474 --> 00:21:19,351
Your breakfast is getting cold.

283
00:21:19,683 --> 00:21:22,882
And you'd better be getting back to
town if you want to change your duds.

284
00:21:23,088 --> 00:21:24,994
You know, there is
something in what you say.

285
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:26,989
I don't want breakfast.
I'll go with you.

286
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:28,516
Why don't you stay out the week?

287
00:21:28,685 --> 00:21:31,617
Noöne will be using the house, and I can
come down Saturday, and take you in.

288
00:21:31,754 --> 00:21:33,317
The rest and quiet will do you good.

289
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:36,509
Helping me is like shaking hands with
the devil. The worst luck in the world.

290
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:38,331
That's ridiculous.

291
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,618
You really want to go back to town?
- I don't care.

292
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,867
You wouldn't feel obligated
if you stayed, would you?

293
00:21:46,093 --> 00:21:47,998
Why should I? What
difference does it make?

294
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,059
Of course. It doesn't make any
difference. Then you'll stay?

295
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:53,246
Yes, yes! But stop asking me questions.

296
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:57,142
Go on and boast to your friends about
fishing Joyce Heath out of the gutter.

297
00:21:57,895 --> 00:22:00,138
I won't mention it, I can assure you.

298
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,912
Better watch her pretty closely. She's
on the verge of going off the deep end.

299
00:22:20,198 --> 00:22:22,505
Come and have your breakfast
before it gets cold.

300
00:22:22,743 --> 00:22:24,189
May I please have a drink?

301
00:22:24,931 --> 00:22:26,969
Fresh milk? Country sausage?

302
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:29,469
Come and get it. There
is lots to tuck away.

303
00:22:29,676 --> 00:22:31,986
I asked for a drink. Where's the bottle?

304
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,549
Yes dear .. after you've eaten.

305
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,881
I don't want your greasy food.
I want a drink! Where is it?

306
00:22:38,145 --> 00:22:40,828
Now, it will only make you
more sick and fidgety.

307
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:45,001
You're worn to a frazzle.
What you need is rest and food.

308
00:22:45,252 --> 00:22:46,887
Where is it?
- Uh ..

309
00:22:47,513 --> 00:22:49,094
I don't know.
- You're a liar!

310
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:57,368
Now, now, now, now.
- Give me the key!

311
00:22:58,227 --> 00:22:59,551
I haven't got it.

312
00:23:03,772 --> 00:23:05,687
My dear!
- Leave me alone!

313
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:09,734
You've cut yourself.

314
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,768
I reckon it isn't the first time you've
been hurt getting things you shouldn't.

315
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,778
Oh stop nagging me .. get out!

316
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,821
Get <i>out</i> will you!

317
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:44,638
Ah, "phantom of delight"
as Wordsworth says.

318
00:23:46,188 --> 00:23:49,255
A little thing I thought up myself.
- And not bad, either.

319
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:55,535
And what's the little woman been doing?
- Shopping. You?

320
00:23:56,117 --> 00:24:00,249
Getting a check for a theater job.
Next week I go in escrow.

321
00:24:00,703 --> 00:24:04,361
Grand, isn't it? And those estates,
they'll be your masterpiece, I know it.

322
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:06,502
I've talked to more people
that are interested.

323
00:24:06,906 --> 00:24:08,064
Well, they'd better be.

324
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,932
When my creditors get
through subdividing my shirt ..

325
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,440
There won't be enough of it left
to show on a blue serge suit.

326
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,498
Stop worrying. By the way, I'll take you
take to the polo match. Teddy's playing.

327
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:19,678
Teddy?

328
00:24:20,412 --> 00:24:24,657
I wonder why he doesn't use a croquet
mallet. He's on the ground mostly.

329
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:27,687
We must hurry up, we've
missed the first chukka as it is.

330
00:24:27,903 --> 00:24:29,599
I'll take 4-1 on Teddy's collar-bone.

331
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:32,147
Nope. But I'll take 2-1 on a rib.

332
00:24:33,861 --> 00:24:36,544
Oh, I can't go ..
- Why not?

333
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,805
I just remembered I've promised to go
down to the country this afternoon.

334
00:24:40,322 --> 00:24:41,018
Why?

335
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:44,605
Well, it's rather an
interesting case .. I uh ..

336
00:24:45,045 --> 00:24:48,423
Remember the night that you and I and
Teddy sneaked out of the Linden party?

337
00:24:48,761 --> 00:24:52,160
Well .. oh I forgot.
I promised not to tell.

338
00:24:52,937 --> 00:24:54,213
It sounds intriguing.

339
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,369
Well it was a peculiar incident.

340
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,755
I don't see any reason
why I shouldn't tell you.

341
00:25:00,647 --> 00:25:03,811
Nope, better not. A promise is a
promise. Will you be home by Sunday?

342
00:25:04,055 --> 00:25:04,938
Tonight.

343
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:07,171
If you ask me out to breakfast
Sunday morning, I'll ..

344
00:25:07,271 --> 00:25:10,508
Take you on the golf course, give you
a stroke a hole, and beat the pants ..

345
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:12,204
We call them "slacks".

346
00:25:12,654 --> 00:25:13,616
You may kiss me.

347
00:25:16,108 --> 00:25:17,479
Goodbye. See you Sunday.

348
00:25:28,321 --> 00:25:30,002
Good evening, widow Williams.

349
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,795
Staying to dinner Mister Don? Pot roast.

350
00:25:34,007 --> 00:25:37,087
Pot roast? With all those potatoes
and carrots and onions around it?

351
00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:40,430
Oh, it's a shame to disturb
them. They look so cozy.

352
00:25:41,761 --> 00:25:44,042
And turnips.
- Turnips?

353
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:48,191
And what's the matter with turnips?
Turnips are good for you.

354
00:25:48,511 --> 00:25:50,143
They grow hair on your chest.

355
00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:53,013
Do you eat them?
- Sure.

356
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:55,337
Mr Don, don't be pesky.

357
00:25:58,149 --> 00:25:59,270
How did you guess?

358
00:26:00,062 --> 00:26:01,872
Well, she isn't exactly chatty.

359
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,437
You'll get more conversation
out of a snowman.

360
00:26:05,734 --> 00:26:08,448
Where is she now?
- Gone up the hill towards the barn.

361
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,502
I'd better go and try and find
her. It looks like rain to me.

362
00:26:11,969 --> 00:26:15,321
Now that corn of mine has been
prophesying rain for 30 years.

363
00:26:16,168 --> 00:26:19,746
Excepting once .. and that was
my own fault for trimming it.

364
00:26:20,817 --> 00:26:22,103
I'd better hurry then.

365
00:26:22,699 --> 00:26:24,650
When are you going to
fetch her home, Mister Don?

366
00:26:25,155 --> 00:26:26,843
Whenever she wants to go. Why?

367
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:31,765
Oh, nothing .. I was just talking.
I'll be glad when she's gone, though.

368
00:26:32,727 --> 00:26:33,518
Why?

369
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:37,164
You know, it's different
for a man like you.

370
00:26:37,575 --> 00:26:41,584
But a woman knows an awful lot about
another woman .. and she's dangerous.

371
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:45,144
A bad woman's got something
a good woman ain't.

372
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:49,000
And a good woman is jealous of
that something, and afraid of it.

373
00:26:50,033 --> 00:26:52,929
I don't know what it is,
but she's got it.

374
00:26:53,557 --> 00:26:57,018
Sounds to me as if you've been reading
bad translations of French novels.

375
00:26:58,003 --> 00:27:01,441
In the first place, I don't find her
particularly attractive off the stage.

376
00:27:01,947 --> 00:27:04,615
And in the second place,
it's no concern of yours.

377
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:10,403
I guess he's right. I'm an old fool
getting to be a regular busybody.

378
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:12,442
Miss Heath!

379
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:17,555
Miss Heath!

380
00:27:31,163 --> 00:27:32,236
Miss Heath.

381
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:38,191
Hey .. wake up.

382
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,847
Oh, it's you.

383
00:27:46,905 --> 00:27:51,097
On Saturday .. I fell asleep in a bar.
It all comes back to me now.

384
00:27:51,351 --> 00:27:54,857
Yes, it's also going to rain. It would
be very good sense to come in out of it.

385
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,431
That's merely hearsay.

386
00:27:59,331 --> 00:28:01,388
Would you hand me my shoes
and stockings please?

387
00:28:03,885 --> 00:28:04,815
Thanks.

388
00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:07,012
You know, you are looking much better.

389
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:12,480
I've enjoyed this afternoon. Going
barefoot and sleeping in the sun.

390
00:28:13,378 --> 00:28:17,838
Playing a sort of a Naiad in the jungle.
- What do you mean? What's a "Naiad"?

391
00:28:18,316 --> 00:28:22,768
It's some sort of a wood-nymph.
I'm not very much up on my sprites.

392
00:28:23,772 --> 00:28:27,206
Well, I must say a "Naiad" becomes
you better than a "Maenad".

393
00:28:28,277 --> 00:28:29,255
Fancy!

394
00:28:30,035 --> 00:28:31,331
Well, what's a "Maenad"?

395
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,596
They were mythical women,
famous for their beauty and charm.

396
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:36,568
Who attended the Dionysian rebels.

397
00:28:37,186 --> 00:28:39,537
They were always so carried
away by the wild madness that ..

398
00:28:39,706 --> 00:28:42,887
They ended up by dancing hysterically
over the edge of a cliff to destruction.

399
00:28:44,811 --> 00:28:47,474
Sorry, but I'm too tired
to be hysterical, and my ..

400
00:28:47,872 --> 00:28:49,779
My feet are much too sore
from going barefoot ..

401
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,852
to stand the jar of
dancing over the cliff.

402
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:56,510
By the way .. I got the sermon.

403
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:02,637
There's one little piggy that's going to
market in a shocking state of nudity.

404
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,440
I hope you don't mind me
borrowing some of your clothes.

405
00:29:07,768 --> 00:29:08,970
Not at all.

406
00:29:17,993 --> 00:29:18,917
Sorry.

407
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,874
Looks as if we're going
to have a cloudburst.

408
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,662
Well, what do you find so amusing?

409
00:29:38,269 --> 00:29:40,016
What do you find so disturbing?

410
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,894
Come on, before we get drenched.

411
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:53,011
Naiad or Maenad, nothing. Mermaids ..
- Ha .. come on.

412
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:07,720
Land's sake, you're soaking wet.
- Well, it's all your fault.

413
00:30:08,011 --> 00:30:10,366
If you'd used the corn-plaster,
this wouldn't have happened.

414
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:14,075
You'd better be going back to town
Mr Don, before you have to go in an ark.

415
00:30:14,573 --> 00:30:16,413
Well, you can't drive back in this rain.

416
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,345
And why can't he, may I ask?

417
00:30:19,997 --> 00:30:22,776
Well, driving on that road will be a
good deal like touring in a full bathtub.

418
00:30:22,907 --> 00:30:24,316
I never thought of that.

419
00:30:24,771 --> 00:30:26,569
You'd better turn down
my bed, Mrs Williams.

420
00:30:26,856 --> 00:30:28,447
I'll get up early and drive in.

421
00:31:01,222 --> 00:31:02,612
Listen to that rain.

422
00:31:03,877 --> 00:31:06,373
You know, I saw you on the
opening night of your Juliet.

423
00:31:07,276 --> 00:31:10,033
Did you?
- It was one of your best performances.

424
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:11,389
Yes.

425
00:31:12,173 --> 00:31:14,492
Which play would you prefer
to do more than any other?

426
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,243
One I've never done.

427
00:31:18,182 --> 00:31:19,824
A thing called "But To Die".

428
00:31:21,244 --> 00:31:23,073
I'd give anything in
the world to play it.

429
00:31:23,768 --> 00:31:25,543
I wouldn't have to
act it, I could live it.

430
00:31:25,702 --> 00:31:27,674
Why hasn't somebody produced it for you?

431
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,453
With the "jinx woman" of
the theater? Don't be silly.

432
00:31:32,688 --> 00:31:34,963
I noticed a very interesting
play on your bookshelves.

433
00:31:35,316 --> 00:31:36,344
Which one?

434
00:31:36,763 --> 00:31:40,144
It's called .. "Forever Ends At Dawn".

435
00:31:41,064 --> 00:31:43,881
"Forever Ends At Dawn"?
I don't think I've ever read it.

436
00:31:45,045 --> 00:31:48,088
It's a beautiful last act.
- You wouldn't read it to me, would you?

437
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:51,872
Are you sure you would like to hear it?
- It would be a treat to listen to you.

438
00:31:52,689 --> 00:31:54,435
Well, just the last act then ..

439
00:31:56,191 --> 00:31:58,616
The scene of the play
is the French Riviera.

440
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,799
The story is about a man and a woman.

441
00:32:02,535 --> 00:32:05,408
She's not a very nice person,
but a fascinating one.

442
00:32:06,731 --> 00:32:10,310
The man has a wife or a
fiancée, I've forgotten which ..

443
00:32:10,746 --> 00:32:12,286
With whom he is very much in love.

444
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:16,773
He's intrigued by this woman but
quite nobly resists her charms.

445
00:32:19,114 --> 00:32:22,159
Here it is .. "Forever Ends At Dawn".

446
00:32:23,148 --> 00:32:25,764
You may find the dialog a bit
awkward in spots but I'll ..

447
00:32:26,283 --> 00:32:29,182
I'll try and make it convincing.
- I've never heard you when you weren't.

448
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:30,608
Thank you.

449
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:34,553
This scene takes place in the
woman's room late at night.

450
00:32:35,658 --> 00:32:39,545
The man has to go home in the morning
so he .. comes to say goodbye to her.

451
00:32:43,143 --> 00:32:44,269
I'll read from here.

452
00:32:45,734 --> 00:32:46,596
Richard:

453
00:32:47,347 --> 00:32:51,135
"I had to come and say goodbye and
tell you it's been swell knowing you."

454
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:53,220
Joan:

455
00:32:54,688 --> 00:32:58,004
"Well .. I thought our goodbye
would be different from this."

456
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:00,545
Richard:

457
00:33:01,444 --> 00:33:04,067
"Yes, but you see .. there's always .."

458
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:09,197
"Joan, I know .. that girl
in the back of your heart."

459
00:33:10,734 --> 00:33:11,568
Joan:

460
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:14,467
"Her forever lasts until
death do you part."

461
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,757
"My forever only until dawn."

462
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:22,438
"Tomorrow is where
regrets lie, Richard."

463
00:33:23,486 --> 00:33:25,326
"But there will be no tomorrow for us."

464
00:33:26,468 --> 00:33:29,751
"Only tonight .. which
we steal from no-one."

465
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:34,884
"And forget as a dream which
has no part of our normal lives."

466
00:33:35,868 --> 00:33:38,293
"Over which we had no control."

467
00:33:39,173 --> 00:33:41,566
"And for which we
need feel no obligation."

468
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:45,243
Is that the end of the play?

469
00:33:46,415 --> 00:33:47,279
Almost.

470
00:33:49,455 --> 00:33:50,642
Let's have some music.

471
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,014
You know, you read that beautifully.

472
00:34:14,328 --> 00:34:15,319
Now you know.

473
00:34:17,468 --> 00:34:18,670
I know it won't do.

474
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,799
Where are you going?
- Out for a walk.

475
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,413
In this rain?
- I like walking in the rain.

476
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,623
So do I. I think I'll go too.
- There is only one slicker.

477
00:35:02,205 --> 00:35:03,615
Why don't you go back?

478
00:35:47,825 --> 00:35:50,770
Kidneys and bacon and cornbread
this morning, Mister Don.

479
00:35:51,746 --> 00:35:52,843
That's fine.

480
00:35:54,613 --> 00:35:58,739
Miss Heath not down yet?
- No. I called her 15 minutes ago.

481
00:36:01,981 --> 00:36:03,565
Mrs Williams, would you mind ..?

482
00:36:06,923 --> 00:36:07,922
Good morning.

483
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:11,439
Do you like the negligee I
borrowed from Mrs Williams?

484
00:36:14,178 --> 00:36:15,082
It's fine.

485
00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:24,164
Rather cruel, aren't you?

486
00:36:25,229 --> 00:36:26,326
Why do you say that?

487
00:36:26,544 --> 00:36:29,379
Well, you might at least have smiled
at me as I came down the stairs.

488
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,404
Even if it were a lie.

489
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:34,977
I don't think this is any time to lie.

490
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,735
Or speak the truth or
say anything, in fact.

491
00:36:40,605 --> 00:36:42,302
Could I pour you some coffee?

492
00:36:43,892 --> 00:36:44,759
Joyce.

493
00:36:45,775 --> 00:36:50,350
I hate loose ends .. they tangle
your life, they trip you up.

494
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:53,221
Yes, Don.

495
00:36:55,453 --> 00:36:56,622
Well, last night ..

496
00:36:57,555 --> 00:37:00,126
I'm sorry I kissed you
and said the things I did.

497
00:37:02,077 --> 00:37:03,874
How very gallant of you to say so.

498
00:37:04,603 --> 00:37:05,895
No, you don't understand.

499
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:10,417
You see, I'm engaged to someone.
- And you blame me?

500
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,061
No. It was unfair to you too.

501
00:37:14,257 --> 00:37:16,937
You are so very .. fascinating.

502
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:21,377
I think it was that .. storm and our
nearness that made me lose my senses.

503
00:37:22,985 --> 00:37:25,632
Well, I've got them back this morning,
and I'm asking you to forgive me.

504
00:37:26,521 --> 00:37:29,513
And .. for what I'm saying
now .. if I hurt you.

505
00:37:30,103 --> 00:37:31,035
Hurt me!

506
00:37:34,407 --> 00:37:35,382
You delight me.

507
00:37:35,777 --> 00:37:38,570
You have the most amazing lack
of humor of anyone I've ever known.

508
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:43,295
I shouldn't laugh at you
should I, but I can't help it.

509
00:37:43,611 --> 00:37:46,472
You were so awkward that I almost
laughed in your face at first.

510
00:37:46,572 --> 00:37:48,715
And then it made me quite
sick to think that anyone ..

511
00:37:48,815 --> 00:37:51,166
Could be stupid enough to be
taken in by a lot of old tricks.

512
00:37:52,085 --> 00:37:53,737
I thought you might at least be amusing.

513
00:37:53,895 --> 00:37:56,767
But you turned out to be dull
and stupid and so afraid.

514
00:37:56,955 --> 00:37:58,105
Well, you needn't be.

515
00:37:58,315 --> 00:38:02,011
I won't hurt your Sunday-School
romance or your oh-so-nice career.

516
00:38:02,372 --> 00:38:05,938
Hurt me? Get out of here
before you give me hysterics!

517
00:38:41,413 --> 00:38:43,711
Sorry friend, but I think you stop here.

518
00:38:44,361 --> 00:38:47,317
It does seem advisable doesn't it.
How soon before it's repaired?

519
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:49,099
Oh the lumber will be here at noon.

520
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:51,352
And I think you ought to get
across early this evening.

521
00:38:51,801 --> 00:38:53,561
Too bad you didn't get off last night.

522
00:38:54,515 --> 00:38:55,214
Yeah.

523
00:38:55,883 --> 00:38:58,639
Can one of your men get across and
telephone for me from the other side?

524
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:01,364
Why, sure.
- Have him call Miss Armitage.

525
00:39:02,077 --> 00:39:04,731
At Austin 9532.

526
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:08,560
Say that Mr Bellows has been delayed
and can't see her until this evening.

527
00:39:09,522 --> 00:39:12,559
And I'd be very much obliged if you let
me know the minute I can get across.

528
00:39:12,699 --> 00:39:15,665
I'm up at the old Quinn Farm.
- Okay. The first thing.

529
00:39:41,301 --> 00:39:45,065
[ crying sounds ]

530
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:50,500
[ crying sounds ]

531
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:58,370
Joyce.

532
00:39:59,114 --> 00:39:59,858
Don!

533
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:03,704
You did come back.
I was praying you would.

534
00:40:04,726 --> 00:40:06,103
I had to. You see ..

535
00:40:07,137 --> 00:40:09,754
It doesn't matter why.
You did, you had to.

536
00:40:10,558 --> 00:40:12,802
You didn't believe what I
said this morning, did you?

537
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:14,643
Did you?

538
00:40:15,193 --> 00:40:18,949
I guess I had it coming to me.
- Oh no, no darling. It was a lie.

539
00:40:19,653 --> 00:40:20,988
Well, let's forget about it.

540
00:40:21,138 --> 00:40:23,366
Well, you can forget that. But I
want you to remember this.

541
00:40:23,858 --> 00:40:26,907
I know you belong to somebody else,
and I don't want you, really I don't.

542
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,361
But last night was mine and ..

543
00:40:30,351 --> 00:40:33,866
And I made it ugly this morning. And I
don't want you to think of it that way.

544
00:40:34,278 --> 00:40:35,038
I won't.

545
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,487
You will, unless I tell you the truth.

546
00:40:38,351 --> 00:40:40,732
You've seen me drunk and disgusting.

547
00:40:41,236 --> 00:40:44,254
You took me in out of pity.
Well, that hurt my pride.

548
00:40:45,222 --> 00:40:48,353
And because I'm a good deal of
a shrew, I wanted to hurt yours.

549
00:40:49,505 --> 00:40:51,627
I was going to tease you
with all the tricks I knew ..

550
00:40:51,727 --> 00:40:53,222
Until you tried to kiss me, and ..

551
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,537
Then I was to laugh in your face.

552
00:40:56,401 --> 00:40:59,585
I was an actress playing a part.
Well, I played it too well.

553
00:41:01,036 --> 00:41:03,992
But when you took me in your
arms, I didn't want to laugh.

554
00:41:05,055 --> 00:41:06,249
I wanted to cry.

555
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:09,290
I'm sorry.
- I'm not. I'm glad.

556
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:11,657
Last night was beautiful.

557
00:41:12,814 --> 00:41:14,181
It will always be beautiful.

558
00:41:15,535 --> 00:41:16,783
And now that it's over.

559
00:41:20,655 --> 00:41:21,808
It's not over, Joyce.

560
00:41:22,658 --> 00:41:25,204
Oh yes, Don. It's got to be over.

561
00:41:26,731 --> 00:41:29,564
Your career is on the verge
of permanent success.

562
00:41:30,137 --> 00:41:32,467
You'll have someone who
can help you. I can't.

563
00:41:33,339 --> 00:41:35,713
I'm the kind of woman
who destroys, not builds.

564
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,733
I'm Joyce Heath, Don.

565
00:41:38,546 --> 00:41:39,693
A Maenad who ..

566
00:41:40,557 --> 00:41:43,433
Doesn't want to dance over the
cliff with a man as fine as you.

567
00:41:45,444 --> 00:41:48,223
Now come on, let's finish up
the rest of the day very fine.

568
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,505
I'll get dressed. You go down.

569
00:41:58,624 --> 00:41:59,535
I got it.

570
00:42:05,688 --> 00:42:07,206
No, no. That's not fair.

571
00:42:07,704 --> 00:42:10,483
You must be playing by pinochle rules.
- It's just you're slow, that's all.

572
00:42:10,756 --> 00:42:12,154
Well, no wonder.

573
00:42:12,727 --> 00:42:17,033
These cards are so thick and old I could
be playing with Encyclopedia Britannica.

574
00:42:19,515 --> 00:42:20,961
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

575
00:42:21,703 --> 00:42:23,318
The recipe said it was toffee.

576
00:42:24,738 --> 00:42:26,174
But that's not what we've got.

577
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:31,047
I'll never get my jaws apart.
I can't bite, I said so.

578
00:42:31,742 --> 00:42:33,911
Pardon me a minute, while
I get out a piece of toffee.

579
00:42:34,193 --> 00:42:36,747
I've lost a couple of molars and
a bicuspid that are sticking to it.

580
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:39,521
Did you get it?
- Yes, but I think I lost a nail.

581
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,714
Perhaps we should put some sand in that
mess to give it something to hold on to.

582
00:42:45,742 --> 00:42:47,791
I wonder if Mrs Williams
would like some?

583
00:42:48,051 --> 00:42:50,399
It would certainly take the rattle
out her uppers and lowers.

584
00:43:03,186 --> 00:43:04,458
I wish I'd never seen you.

585
00:43:05,411 --> 00:43:07,441
Never kissed you, never
held you in my arms.

586
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:12,609
Because every time I do,
I hate myself, I hate you.

587
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:17,026
I can kill every emotion except the
desire to hold you just once more.

588
00:43:18,816 --> 00:43:20,375
[ door knocks ]

589
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,161
You can get across the road now, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

590
00:43:29,334 --> 00:43:32,958
I got the phone call through alright.
- Much obliged. Goodnight.

591
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,132
Goodnight.

592
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,423
You can go now?
- Yes.

593
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:44,451
Then you must.

594
00:43:45,747 --> 00:43:47,550
Because if you stay,
it will be too late.

595
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:49,832
I love you.

596
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:55,012
You may never love me but .. you'll
find you always come back to me.

597
00:43:55,941 --> 00:43:58,928
And each time you return it will
cost you more and more until ..

598
00:43:59,616 --> 00:44:03,545
When you've spent your career,
your ambitions, your dreams.

599
00:44:04,529 --> 00:44:08,332
Oh, I'm bad for people. I don't mean
to be, but I can't help myself.

600
00:44:10,237 --> 00:44:11,964
So I'm being generous to you, Don.

601
00:44:12,396 --> 00:44:15,223
Kind, kinder than I've ever
been to anybody before.

602
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:20,167
But I can't be much longer .. so go.

603
00:44:21,072 --> 00:44:22,211
Leave me.

604
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,382
You can leave me, can't you?

605
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:27,919
I don't know.

606
00:44:31,497 --> 00:44:32,868
I've got to find out.

607
00:44:42,802 --> 00:44:45,198
Mister Don gone, Miss?
- Yes.

608
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,459
He's coming back?

609
00:44:49,845 --> 00:44:51,149
Yes, I think he will.

610
00:44:59,687 --> 00:45:01,114
[ door knocks ]

611
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:02,410
Yes.

612
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:08,940
Mr Bellows.
- Uhuh.

613
00:45:09,396 --> 00:45:11,077
Miss Armitage is on the telephone.

614
00:45:14,804 --> 00:45:17,084
Put her on .. no!

615
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:22,008
Tell her I'm still out of town.
I'll call her when I get back.

616
00:45:24,183 --> 00:45:25,506
Very well, sir.

617
00:45:32,184 --> 00:45:36,913
And Mr Haynes of United Quarries has
called to ask if you have a decision.

618
00:45:38,785 --> 00:45:40,823
Tell him I haven't been
able to make up my mind.

619
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:44,180
He said he'd have to have an answer
one way or another. Yes or No.

620
00:45:49,743 --> 00:45:53,361
He's right .. it's got to be Yes or No.

621
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:56,751
Thank you Miss Seals.

622
00:46:07,905 --> 00:46:09,277
[ door knocks ]

623
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,809
Come in.

624
00:46:11,533 --> 00:46:13,712
Mr Bellows, Miss Gail.
- Oh.

625
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:15,547
Well, show him in, Betty.

626
00:46:15,914 --> 00:46:18,801
And we'll have coffee.
- Van Houtte for Mr Bellows?

627
00:46:19,129 --> 00:46:20,265
That's right.

628
00:46:27,727 --> 00:46:30,921
Well, hello Mr B. About time
you were getting back.

629
00:46:37,984 --> 00:46:40,253
Don .. something has happened?

630
00:46:41,288 --> 00:46:43,220
Yes Gail .. something has happened.

631
00:46:43,812 --> 00:46:46,766
Well, even if it is all for the
worst, it can't be so bad.

632
00:46:47,192 --> 00:46:51,295
Because you've the most best assistant
in the world to help you laugh it off.

633
00:46:51,913 --> 00:46:54,786
Or .. work it out.
Whichever we're going to do.

634
00:46:56,467 --> 00:46:58,805
Gail, it would make me prouder
to have you as my wife ..

635
00:46:58,974 --> 00:47:00,945
Than to have any other
woman in the world.

636
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:06,323
If I could respect you a little less, it
would all be very simple, but I can't.

637
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,708
So I must ask you a question.

638
00:47:09,178 --> 00:47:11,516
I'm afraid I know the answer already.

639
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:13,332
What is it, Don?

640
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:18,379
If we were married, there is one
humiliation you would never know.

641
00:47:18,538 --> 00:47:20,670
That's having me deceive
you with someone else.

642
00:47:21,219 --> 00:47:23,533
I know that.
- But if there were someone else ..

643
00:47:24,144 --> 00:47:27,702
Someone I didn't love, that I'll
never even see again, but who ..

644
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:32,369
But who had a strange,
exotic fascination for me.

645
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:34,398
An appeal I couldn't kill.

646
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:38,065
Would that make any difference to you?

647
00:47:39,133 --> 00:47:40,621
Yes Don, it would.

648
00:47:40,882 --> 00:47:42,944
Whether you ever went to
her or not, wouldn't matter.

649
00:47:43,137 --> 00:47:45,625
But the fact that you'd want to would.

650
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:49,322
It mightn't make me love
any less .. perhaps more.

651
00:47:50,317 --> 00:47:53,285
But the agony of wondering every time
you kissed me whether you think of her.

652
00:47:53,632 --> 00:47:55,621
The hate and dread I'd have
for that other woman.

653
00:47:55,942 --> 00:47:59,428
And the terrific loneliness of that
little part of you which I wouldn't own.

654
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:01,459
Would be unendurable.

655
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:17,411
I can't tell you Don, how much I admire
you for .. for being so honest.

656
00:48:18,023 --> 00:48:20,541
And thank you for coming to say goodbye.

657
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:23,017
You're a ..

658
00:48:26,298 --> 00:48:27,299
Goodbye.

659
00:48:38,032 --> 00:48:40,741
Mr Bellows gone, Miss Gail?
Is he coming back?

660
00:48:42,281 --> 00:48:43,032
Yes.

661
00:48:44,647 --> 00:48:46,272
Yes, I think he will.

662
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:53,182
Mr Sheffield, I've come to see you for
some advice on producing a play.

663
00:48:53,482 --> 00:48:55,221
That's something I know nothing about.

664
00:48:55,745 --> 00:49:00,656
An angel is a celestial being after
death, Don. But before .. he's a sucker.

665
00:49:01,613 --> 00:49:04,120
Thanks for the warning.
What I want is an opinion.

666
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:07,406
Have you ever heard of a
play called "But To Die"?

667
00:49:07,888 --> 00:49:11,396
A magnificent script, which with the
proper lead would make a great play.

668
00:49:11,951 --> 00:49:13,789
However, miscast ..

669
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:17,395
It would close so fast the third act
curtain would snag in the stage door.

670
00:49:18,203 --> 00:49:19,620
Who do you see in the lead?

671
00:49:20,485 --> 00:49:24,352
There are only two women who could have
played it: Jean Eagles and Joyce Heath.

672
00:49:24,531 --> 00:49:26,735
Eagles is dead .. Heath has disappeared.

673
00:49:27,169 --> 00:49:28,221
So, forget it.

674
00:49:28,472 --> 00:49:31,507
If I made both the script and Miss Heath
available to you, would you produce it?

675
00:49:32,316 --> 00:49:34,596
Mr Bellows, I have great
respect for the script.

676
00:49:34,945 --> 00:49:37,256
And almost a reverence
for Miss Heath's talent.

677
00:49:37,565 --> 00:49:40,345
But I wouldn't hazard
$80,000 to defy a jinx.

678
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:44,187
Surely an intelligent man like you won't
take any stock in a legend like that?

679
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,723
When you asked $80,000
for a share of it I do.

680
00:49:48,423 --> 00:49:50,175
Suppose I pay the $80,000?

681
00:49:51,743 --> 00:49:54,319
Then I would produce
and direct it myself.

682
00:49:54,939 --> 00:49:56,836
Will you have your lawyer
draw up the contract?

683
00:49:57,762 --> 00:49:58,823
Very well.

684
00:49:59,658 --> 00:50:02,678
By the way .. do you
bite your fingernails?

685
00:50:03,962 --> 00:50:05,709
No.
- You will.

686
00:50:15,299 --> 00:50:18,191
[ dog barking ]

687
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,682
You did come.
- You knew I would.

688
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:57,889
Yes, I knew.

689
00:51:06,815 --> 00:51:09,313
Let's go inside, I've only got a
minute. I've got to go right back.

690
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:10,824
Tonight?
- Yeah.

691
00:51:20,275 --> 00:51:21,740
Darling.
- Joyce.

692
00:51:23,974 --> 00:51:25,176
I want to talk to you.

693
00:51:33,363 --> 00:51:34,330
Now listen ..

694
00:51:34,819 --> 00:51:38,206
You and I are both artists. I deal
in permanence, things that last.

695
00:51:38,591 --> 00:51:42,087
You in emotions, moments, things
that flame and burn and leave ashes.

696
00:51:42,793 --> 00:51:44,568
So we're not the same. I know that.

697
00:51:45,723 --> 00:51:48,164
But is there any consistency in
the way you feel towards me?

698
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:50,887
Couldn't we ask questions afterwards?

699
00:51:51,253 --> 00:51:53,928
No .. I can't build without plans.

700
00:51:54,707 --> 00:51:57,586
Answer me, Joyce. Is there any
consistency in your feelings towards me?

701
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,661
Tonight I love you so much that nothing
else matters. A love you couldn't kill.

702
00:52:04,749 --> 00:52:05,982
But that's tonight.

703
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,747
Tomorrow should be the
same. I want it to be.

704
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:13,954
But I've betrayed so often by
tomorrows, I don't dare promise that.

705
00:52:15,352 --> 00:52:17,347
It's the only honest answer
I can give you darling.

706
00:52:18,179 --> 00:52:21,599
That's a gentleman's answer, Joyce.
- I guess I'm not lady enough to lie.

707
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,949
No, I don't think you would.

708
00:52:26,614 --> 00:52:27,935
I broke my engagement.

709
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:30,790
Why?
- Because of us.

710
00:52:32,229 --> 00:52:34,846
Well, what about her?
- Now, let's leave her out of it.

711
00:52:35,925 --> 00:52:39,255
I know that she's stronger than us,
as if she weren't, I wouldn't be here.

712
00:52:40,345 --> 00:52:41,633
And I'm glad I'm weaker.

713
00:52:42,598 --> 00:52:45,265
You are too, aren't you? Say you are.
- No, I'm not.

714
00:52:46,269 --> 00:52:49,274
I'm here.
- That's all I care about.

715
00:52:49,678 --> 00:52:51,715
There are other things
that are important to me.

716
00:52:52,631 --> 00:52:54,235
First of all, your career.

717
00:52:54,941 --> 00:52:56,939
Why should you concern
yourself about that?

718
00:52:57,211 --> 00:52:59,594
Because you don't belong in
the audience, but on the stage.

719
00:53:00,216 --> 00:53:03,030
Your emotion, your restlessness,
have beauty and poetry there.

720
00:53:03,631 --> 00:53:06,201
Off the stage they'd be brutal.
They would ruin us both.

721
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:11,132
I hope that in the theater you'll find
enough release to be content with me.

722
00:53:11,816 --> 00:53:14,145
Why should I find
contentment? I don't want it.

723
00:53:14,464 --> 00:53:17,574
Well I do. I want you,
and I want peace, too.

724
00:53:18,137 --> 00:53:21,003
They wouldn't let me inside the theater.
They'd be afraid it would fall down.

725
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:25,245
You start rehearsing "But To Die" for
George Sheffield on Monday morning.

726
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,095
What?

727
00:53:28,243 --> 00:53:29,238
Me?

728
00:53:30,459 --> 00:53:31,736
But To Die?

729
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,412
Oh you're mad.
Sheffield wouldn't risk it.

730
00:53:34,975 --> 00:53:36,750
You get the script from him tomorrow.

731
00:53:37,613 --> 00:53:40,710
Don .. did you put your money in it?
- Yes.

732
00:53:41,067 --> 00:53:44,663
Oh you fool .. you crazy fool!
Something will happen.

733
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,085
I've told you a million
times I'm a jinx.

734
00:53:47,555 --> 00:53:49,801
You are no such thing.
You're a great actress.

735
00:53:50,324 --> 00:53:53,966
I'm so sure, I'm risking the money that's
to realize the one ambition I ever had.

736
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:56,515
You're going to be better than you were.

737
00:53:56,615 --> 00:53:59,564
If I'm going to marry Joyce Heath,
it's got to be the <i>real</i> Joyce Heath.

738
00:54:07,605 --> 00:54:09,417
Marry?
- Yes.

739
00:54:09,737 --> 00:54:12,449
I can't compromise, and I
won't sneak and apologize.

740
00:54:13,285 --> 00:54:16,055
I'm playing you a game,
but I'm playing it for keeps.

741
00:54:18,891 --> 00:54:19,943
What's the matter?

742
00:54:23,023 --> 00:54:24,506
Nothing, only ..

743
00:54:25,987 --> 00:54:28,170
Well, it's all happened
so quickly you know.

744
00:54:28,504 --> 00:54:33,114
Being told about doing the play, and
your wanting to marry me. You see ..

745
00:54:34,692 --> 00:54:36,649
Well, it would ruin your career, Don.

746
00:54:37,048 --> 00:54:39,278
Your society and
theater .. they don't mix.

747
00:54:39,508 --> 00:54:40,827
There is still marriage.

748
00:54:41,983 --> 00:54:45,351
Yes, I know but .. let's not
talk about it just now.

749
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:47,539
Speak, Don.

750
00:54:48,168 --> 00:54:50,818
Going on the stage for the first
time in two years to play for you ..

751
00:54:51,107 --> 00:54:52,650
Your career and mine.

752
00:54:53,154 --> 00:54:55,889
Our lives, our success depending
on one performance.

753
00:54:56,895 --> 00:54:59,158
When the lights go out
and that curtain goes up ..

754
00:54:59,402 --> 00:55:01,242
Oh Don, that is being alive.

755
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:04,135
I love you, I love you for
bringing me back to life.

756
00:55:04,876 --> 00:55:06,980
Are you going back to town tonight?
- Right away.

757
00:55:07,308 --> 00:55:08,895
Well, I'm going with you.
- Why?

758
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,036
To leave two years behind.

759
00:55:13,799 --> 00:55:15,029
Faster!

760
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,737
Faster.

761
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:37,267
So that's all it's been to you, Charles.
Just a ship-board romance.

762
00:55:37,521 --> 00:55:38,966
Oh, no it wasn't.
- Oh yes.

763
00:55:39,689 --> 00:55:44,171
Just a man telling a woman that the
moon is not half as lovely as she is.

764
00:55:44,969 --> 00:55:47,235
Swearing devotion eternal as the tides.

765
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:50,643
Sweeping the girl off her
feet .. all to be forgotten.

766
00:55:52,418 --> 00:55:54,140
Well, that isn't what it meant to me.

767
00:55:54,661 --> 00:55:56,737
No Charles. It has meant far more.

768
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:00,652
Your every word, your every
kiss, your every caress.

769
00:56:01,571 --> 00:56:02,563
I've treasured.

770
00:56:03,637 --> 00:56:06,819
Because I've always pretended they
belong to the man I really love.

771
00:56:10,705 --> 00:56:12,385
Now that's something for you to forget.

772
00:56:13,304 --> 00:56:14,280
If you can.

773
00:56:15,586 --> 00:56:16,484
That's fine.

774
00:56:16,987 --> 00:56:18,241
How about it, Miss Heath?

775
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:20,058
Too tired to go through
that scene again?

776
00:56:20,272 --> 00:56:21,333
No, I'd love to.

777
00:56:22,407 --> 00:56:26,094
I'm sorry .. I've got to
beg off .. I'm all in.

778
00:56:26,909 --> 00:56:28,639
You've got too much vitality for me.

779
00:56:29,012 --> 00:56:31,227
And for me too .. we'll call it off.

780
00:56:31,536 --> 00:56:34,457
No rehearsal tomorrow. And we'll run
through it again at 10 o'clock Monday.

781
00:56:34,729 --> 00:56:36,823
I don't like to work on the
day of the night we open.

782
00:56:37,001 --> 00:56:39,355
But there's some things
I must change .. that's all.

783
00:56:40,013 --> 00:56:41,025
Alright boys ..

784
00:56:44,622 --> 00:56:47,354
Give me a cigarette.
- Sure .. what do you think?

785
00:56:47,513 --> 00:56:49,669
I've spent a fortune and
misspent a life in the theater.

786
00:56:50,029 --> 00:56:52,292
But this is the only time on
the eve of a dress rehearsal ..

787
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,179
I've had nerve enough
to say I had a hit.

788
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:55,487
You're pretty positive.

789
00:56:55,587 --> 00:56:57,880
So positive that I'll buy your
piece of it for a $100,000.

790
00:56:58,094 --> 00:57:02,570
Oh no. Here's one angel who isn't afraid
to tread. I'm just as certain as you are.

791
00:57:03,782 --> 00:57:04,955
Isn't she magnificent?

792
00:57:05,209 --> 00:57:07,702
Even in rehearsal, the greatest
performance I've ever seen.

793
00:57:08,184 --> 00:57:12,107
With the stimulus of an audience, Monday
will make her immortal in the theater.

794
00:57:12,691 --> 00:57:13,793
What about that jinx?

795
00:57:13,893 --> 00:57:16,644
The devil himself couldn't
jinx a talent like that.

796
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:17,668
Like it?

797
00:57:17,846 --> 00:57:20,587
Oh, it's alright, I guess.
Needs a lot of work, though.

798
00:57:20,926 --> 00:57:24,174
You know darling, if I could get away to
the country and go over this on Sunday.

799
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:26,840
I think I'd get a better perspective.
Would you run me down tonight?

800
00:57:26,981 --> 00:57:29,852
Certainly, not a bad idea.
We'd better get under way.

801
00:57:29,952 --> 00:57:31,907
I must stop by the apartment
to get my clothes.

802
00:57:32,007 --> 00:57:33,172
Alright .. goodnight.

803
00:57:33,384 --> 00:57:36,111
Goodnight, and keep her out of
the poison ivy and the fresh air.

804
00:57:36,426 --> 00:57:38,253
I don't want her to open in a whisper.

805
00:57:43,954 --> 00:57:45,030
Darling.

806
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:49,906
We can't go on like this.

807
00:57:50,389 --> 00:57:52,451
I could .. forever.

808
00:57:52,608 --> 00:57:54,583
Don't be evasive Joyce.
You know what I mean.

809
00:57:56,042 --> 00:57:57,178
Getting married?

810
00:57:58,244 --> 00:57:59,026
Well ..

811
00:57:59,896 --> 00:58:01,503
Of course, sometime darling.

812
00:58:01,946 --> 00:58:04,931
But right now .. there
is the show to think of.

813
00:58:05,401 --> 00:58:07,520
You always find some reason
to change the subject.

814
00:58:08,054 --> 00:58:09,962
Tell me the truth. Why
are you putting me off?

815
00:58:10,517 --> 00:58:12,120
Don't be so intense, Don.

816
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:16,206
You know I love you and that there
is no-one else .. isn't that enough?

817
00:58:16,356 --> 00:58:19,076
No, it's not enough. What's the matter,
are you afraid to marry me?

818
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:22,072
Afraid? Why should I be?

819
00:58:22,312 --> 00:58:25,286
I don't know, unless you think marriage
will make me harder to get rid of.

820
00:58:25,452 --> 00:58:27,031
Oh don't say that Don. Don't.

821
00:58:27,623 --> 00:58:30,921
That night when you asked me, I told
you I couldn't promise you tomorrows.

822
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:35,145
I can now. I love you enough
to give them all to you.

823
00:58:35,806 --> 00:58:37,136
At least as many as you want.

824
00:58:37,248 --> 00:58:39,569
Then we'll be married right after
the opening on Monday night.

825
00:58:41,304 --> 00:58:42,138
So soon?

826
00:58:42,461 --> 00:58:44,707
If you meant what you said just
now, it wouldn't seem soon.

827
00:58:44,895 --> 00:58:47,592
Well, it's not that Don, only ..
- Only what?

828
00:58:47,939 --> 00:58:51,135
Well .. well marriage seems to make
such an issue out of everything.

829
00:58:51,743 --> 00:58:53,287
Why can't we wait a while?
- No.

830
00:58:53,465 --> 00:58:56,034
I'm not going to trail around after
you like a stage-door Johnny.

831
00:58:56,179 --> 00:58:58,818
And make a sap out of myself
waiting for you to get out of a mood.

832
00:58:59,231 --> 00:59:01,766
I want you .. but I'm through begging.

833
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,029
It's either Monday night or never.

834
00:59:06,996 --> 00:59:09,968
Well of course, darling .. alright.

835
00:59:10,391 --> 00:59:12,798
I'll marry you Monday,
right after the show.

836
00:59:13,415 --> 00:59:15,396
We'll go down to the
park for one glorious day ..

837
00:59:15,574 --> 00:59:18,513
And I hope it rains and washes
the bridge and the roads away.

838
00:59:18,813 --> 00:59:22,530
So we'll be marooned forever. Put your
arms around me, and tell me you love me.

839
00:59:23,046 --> 00:59:25,864
Look here Joyce, you're almost
hysterical. What's the matter?

840
00:59:26,015 --> 00:59:29,497
Oh nothing. Excitement, nerves.
Worrying about the show.

841
00:59:29,724 --> 00:59:33,066
Listen, I've changed my mind.
I'm very tired from rehearsing.

842
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:35,892
I'd rather go to the country alone.
Would you lend me your car?

843
00:59:36,391 --> 00:59:39,508
Well, sure if you want, but I'd hate
to have you driving alone at night.

844
00:59:39,705 --> 00:59:43,930
Oh, don't be silly. Now be a good boy,
and go now or you'll see me cry.

845
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:49,124
Hey, what's the matter?
- Nothing I tell you, but stage fright.

846
00:59:49,274 --> 00:59:51,293
Go home now, there is
always a taxi out front.

847
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:55,565
I see that the old Southern hospitality
and the artistic temperament don't mix.

848
00:59:55,838 --> 00:59:59,488
Goodnight, drive carefully and
leave the jitters down there.

849
01:00:18,409 --> 01:00:21,828
I got your bag all packed for you, honey.
- Well, put it down and get out of here!

850
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,122
Yes, ma'am.

851
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:30,154
Joyce.

852
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:33,591
I hoped you'd come
like this so many times.

853
01:01:35,056 --> 01:01:38,250
And you have, haven't you?
- Yes .. on business.

854
01:01:39,272 --> 01:01:40,135
Come in.

855
01:01:46,933 --> 01:01:48,802
I rather hate to have
you see my quarters.

856
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:52,013
Spare yourself any embarrassment.
I didn't come here out of curiosity.

857
01:01:52,498 --> 01:01:54,117
You'll find this one more comfortable.

858
01:01:54,217 --> 01:01:56,614
I shan't be here long enough
to find this one uncomfortable.

859
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:02,029
Cigarette?
- No thank you.

860
01:02:18,773 --> 01:02:21,244
You still hate me, don't you?
- No Gordon, I don't.

861
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,590
There is an element of respect and
hate. All I feel for you is contempt.

862
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:28,793
You are very fortunate.

863
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:32,810
Contempt is much easier to carry in your
heart than a love you can't destroy.

864
01:02:36,054 --> 01:02:37,617
You do love me, don't you Gordon?

865
01:02:39,306 --> 01:02:42,180
When a man ruins his life for something,
it's liable to be pretty real.

866
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:47,605
I'm a bookkeeper now, Joyce.
In a company that I used to own.

867
01:02:49,325 --> 01:02:50,939
The worst of it is, I can't hate you.

868
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:53,485
I don't suppose you can understand that.

869
01:02:53,983 --> 01:02:56,085
I never could before. I do now.

870
01:02:57,563 --> 01:03:00,329
You see, I lost somebody
that way too, Gordon.

871
01:03:01,259 --> 01:03:02,386
Heaven help you.

872
01:03:02,793 --> 01:03:05,362
Heaven help me .. if you won't.

873
01:03:07,691 --> 01:03:10,299
You want me to divorce you?
- Oh yes, Gordon.

874
01:03:11,322 --> 01:03:14,047
I've told you time and
time again, that I won't.

875
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:18,016
You are my wife .. something
will never be to any other man.

876
01:03:19,303 --> 01:03:22,773
Being your husband is the only thing
I've got left and I <i>won't</i> lose it!

877
01:03:25,099 --> 01:03:26,974
You'll be my wife until the day I die.

878
01:03:27,841 --> 01:03:29,221
Then I'll divorce you.

879
01:03:30,289 --> 01:03:31,632
You can't, Joyce.

880
01:03:32,477 --> 01:03:34,429
You haven't any grounds.
You never will have.

881
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:47,014
Gordon .. I know I've ruined your
happiness, but don't ruin mine.

882
01:03:47,437 --> 01:03:49,470
If it's revenge you want,
I'll give it to you.

883
01:03:49,658 --> 01:03:52,584
I'll beg, I'll crawl, I'll do
anything. Anything!

884
01:03:52,922 --> 01:03:55,489
Gordon .. Gordon, look at me.

885
01:03:55,946 --> 01:03:57,767
If you want to humiliate me,
you know how.

886
01:03:57,936 --> 01:04:00,716
But set me free, give me my
one chance of happiness.

887
01:04:01,283 --> 01:04:04,342
Please Gordon .. please, please!

888
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:09,261
Oh you cheap, petty bookkeeper, you.

889
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:14,475
Every time I think of those sticky hands
of yours touching me, it makes me sick.

890
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:17,867
"Sick" do you hear? You're
everything that's repulsive to me.

891
01:04:18,299 --> 01:04:22,175
Your wife? I've never been a wife
to you, you poor, simpering fool.

892
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,755
If you had any pride, if you were a
man, instead of a drooling milksop.

893
01:04:26,085 --> 01:04:28,949
You'd throw me out and be ashamed
to admit that you ever married me!

894
01:04:33,556 --> 01:04:35,938
I guess I'm better protected
against you than I used to be.

895
01:04:40,686 --> 01:04:42,837
Neither that, nor what
you said seemed to hurt.

896
01:04:43,723 --> 01:04:44,644
Gordon.

897
01:04:46,193 --> 01:04:48,456
Gordon .. you <i>can't</i> still love me.

898
01:04:49,189 --> 01:04:50,625
When you know how I feel.

899
01:04:51,743 --> 01:04:52,860
Yes, I do.

900
01:04:53,367 --> 01:04:54,851
And .. you ..

901
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:57,536
And I won't divorce you .. no.

902
01:05:15,936 --> 01:05:17,119
Gordon.

903
01:05:18,407 --> 01:05:20,919
Gordon, I guess we're
ordained never to be happy.

904
01:05:21,529 --> 01:05:24,512
So perhaps it would be better to
make the best of what we have.

905
01:05:25,228 --> 01:05:27,423
To try and find contentment together.

906
01:05:28,444 --> 01:05:31,179
That's all I'd ask, Joyce .. ever.

907
01:05:32,317 --> 01:05:34,441
I'm going down to the
country over the weekend.

908
01:05:35,468 --> 01:05:37,070
Come along if you like.

909
01:05:38,337 --> 01:05:39,628
May I, Joyce?

910
01:05:40,321 --> 01:05:41,421
May I?

911
01:05:52,685 --> 01:05:53,821
Gordon.

912
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:56,771
Would nothing in the world
induce you to divorce me?

913
01:05:57,869 --> 01:05:58,770
Nothing.

914
01:05:59,131 --> 01:06:01,446
Not even to save your life?
- No.

915
01:06:02,347 --> 01:06:04,530
Then we're going to settle
this thing once and for all.

916
01:06:04,917 --> 01:06:06,889
If I can't have him, I'd rather be dead.

917
01:06:07,347 --> 01:06:10,141
It's going to be your life or mine.
- Good!

918
01:06:11,093 --> 01:06:14,145
We're coming to a tree in the
middle of the road. We're taking it.

919
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:17,995
If you're killed, I'll be free. If I'm
killed, it really doesn't matter.

920
01:06:18,288 --> 01:06:21,094
If we both die .. good riddance.
- Good!

921
01:06:21,493 --> 01:06:24,404
You've taken everything else but
my life. I don't want that without you.

922
01:06:24,627 --> 01:06:26,332
Go ahead .. crash it!

923
01:06:37,609 --> 01:06:40,860
Well, I heard a crash,
and I came a running.

924
01:06:41,388 --> 01:06:44,642
And then I saw Miss Heath with
this fellow. And that's all I know.

925
01:06:44,991 --> 01:06:47,737
Oh, I wonder how badly
the little thing is hurt.

926
01:06:47,913 --> 01:06:49,610
But how do you know it was Joyce Heath?

927
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:52,268
Well, she's been staying
at Mr Bellows' farm.

928
01:06:52,655 --> 01:06:54,827
I ought to know. I'm his housekeeper.

929
01:06:55,226 --> 01:06:57,440
Mr Bellows? You mean
Donald Bellows the architect?

930
01:06:57,596 --> 01:07:01,669
That's who I mean. And if you want to
know more you'd better ask him yourself.

931
01:07:01,927 --> 01:07:03,610
He should be here by now. I phoned.

932
01:07:03,817 --> 01:07:06,454
Yeah thanks. It might
be a good idea to ask.

933
01:07:12,731 --> 01:07:15,687
Listen, I need First Aid.
I'm a reporter, I got a lead.

934
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:19,200
I don't want to use the pay-phone
because of the other reporters, so ..

935
01:07:19,408 --> 01:07:22,108
Can I use yours?
- I suppose so.

936
01:07:29,586 --> 01:07:32,760
Another Florence Nightingale.
Hello, give me Rewrite.

937
01:07:33,887 --> 01:07:34,601
Eddie?

938
01:07:34,701 --> 01:07:37,442
Listen, get this and don't squeeze it
because it will squirt in your eyes.

939
01:07:38,355 --> 01:07:39,403
Yeah, juicy.

940
01:07:39,861 --> 01:07:43,407
Joyce Heath who's opening a new show on
Monday was hurt in an auto accident.

941
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:45,970
With her was unidentified man.

942
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:49,003
The housekeeper for Don Bellows,
socialite and architect.

943
01:07:49,392 --> 01:07:51,680
Just admitted Joyce had
been living at his farm.

944
01:07:52,459 --> 01:07:55,608
Bellows recently broke his engagement to
Gail Armitage of the "Utter Armitages".

945
01:07:56,043 --> 01:07:58,026
Yeah, check that last
and I'll call you back.

946
01:07:58,273 --> 01:08:01,219
And get your bucket and spade ready,
as I think we'll dish up some dirt.

947
01:08:01,763 --> 01:08:02,827
Okay.

948
01:08:06,501 --> 01:08:09,820
Well .. it's better than collecting
garbage. It's not so heavy.

949
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:19,228
Pardon me, I'm Donald Bellows.
What about Miss Heath? It isn't serious?

950
01:08:19,472 --> 01:08:22,956
Well .. oh there's a Doctor now. Doctor.

951
01:08:23,822 --> 01:08:25,771
Doctor, this is Mr Bellows,
about Miss Heath.

952
01:08:26,017 --> 01:08:27,778
How is she?
- Badly shaken up.

953
01:08:28,013 --> 01:08:30,604
Suffering from shock and
a very slight concussion.

954
01:08:31,193 --> 01:08:33,048
She may be on her feet
in a couple of weeks.

955
01:08:33,494 --> 01:08:35,543
The man however, is very seriously hurt.

956
01:08:36,017 --> 01:08:38,165
It may be more than a year
before he'll be able to walk.

957
01:08:38,896 --> 01:08:40,971
What man?
- Gordon Heath.

958
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,245
Gordon Heath?
- Yes.

959
01:08:44,433 --> 01:08:47,543
He's been identified as her husband.
- Her husband?

960
01:08:48,050 --> 01:08:50,700
Mrs Heath is conscious if you would
care to see her a few minutes.

961
01:08:51,111 --> 01:08:52,965
No, I don't want to see her.

962
01:08:54,406 --> 01:08:57,208
Please see that they both
get every possible care.

963
01:08:57,702 --> 01:08:59,415
Anything. I'll be responsible.

964
01:09:01,421 --> 01:09:05,495
I think you just handed him one, Doc.
But it will sure look swell in print.

965
01:09:25,909 --> 01:09:28,489
Yes? .. Oh yes, Don.

966
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,714
We've got to open without
her .. what else can I do?

967
01:09:33,543 --> 01:09:37,453
The understudy, and she'll put the show
right back on track for Keynes warehouse.

968
01:09:38,486 --> 01:09:41,900
Yes, she's jinxed you out of $80,000,
me out of the best show I ever had.

969
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:46,163
And herself out of a performance that
would make her a great American actress.

970
01:09:46,971 --> 01:09:48,334
Sorry, old boy.

971
01:09:50,599 --> 01:09:51,922
[ door knocks ]

972
01:09:53,181 --> 01:09:54,249
Yes.

973
01:09:54,955 --> 01:09:56,622
Mr Elmont is here.

974
01:09:59,756 --> 01:10:02,198
You got here in a hurry.
- It's important.

975
01:10:02,726 --> 01:10:04,495
Yes?
- Bellows ..

976
01:10:05,472 --> 01:10:07,186
We're unable to make the loan.

977
01:10:09,211 --> 01:10:10,342
Not make it?

978
01:10:10,741 --> 01:10:14,995
Why, it's almost a million dollars. You
can't sell me out .. I'm ready to start.

979
01:10:15,366 --> 01:10:18,957
It's rumored that you put $80,000
in a show that's doomed to fail.

980
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,691
Is that correct?
- Fail?

981
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:23,952
Yes .. it will fail but ..

982
01:10:24,543 --> 01:10:26,515
I can borrow that someplace else.

983
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,534
That's only a technicality.

984
01:10:29,038 --> 01:10:31,526
We're forced to take advantage
of that technicality.

985
01:10:31,998 --> 01:10:35,966
The board of directors, most of whom
are socially prominent .. insist on it.

986
01:10:37,705 --> 01:10:39,888
Would you mind being
specific instead of subtle?

987
01:10:40,264 --> 01:10:44,678
They feel the people who would've bought
the estates are prejudiced against you.

988
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:47,587
In other words, they don't
think that you can sell them.

989
01:10:48,103 --> 01:10:50,298
Because they are going to stop you.
- Stop me?

990
01:10:50,885 --> 01:10:53,948
Those snobs! Well, they won't.
They or anybody else.

991
01:10:54,688 --> 01:10:58,317
I put ten years in. I put in everything
I ever earned into those estates.

992
01:10:59,007 --> 01:11:00,556
I'm not going to lose them.

993
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:02,992
I'll get the money somewhere.

994
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:05,962
Well .. I hope you do.

995
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,485
But I don't think you can.

996
01:11:12,485 --> 01:11:15,452
Well Miss Seals, let's have the
rest of the unfinished business.

997
01:11:15,921 --> 01:11:20,628
The Roma Cement Company called.
- Ignore it. We're not building anything.

998
01:11:21,481 --> 01:11:24,057
Mr Durrell called, and a Mr Wilson.

999
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:28,095
And Miss Heath from the hospital.
She said it was urgent.

1000
01:11:30,665 --> 01:11:34,259
Yes, I guess that does come
under "unfinished business".

1001
01:11:35,419 --> 01:11:37,546
Are you sure you called
his office, his home?

1002
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:41,162
Yes dear, don't worry.
Everything will be alright.

1003
01:11:41,475 --> 01:11:45,170
It's not I tell you. He couldn't let
me lie here even if he hated me.

1004
01:11:48,788 --> 01:11:49,890
Don!

1005
01:11:50,888 --> 01:11:53,282
Why have you waited to so
long to come and see me?

1006
01:11:59,731 --> 01:12:02,602
You blame me for what
happened. I knew you would.

1007
01:12:03,259 --> 01:12:06,961
That's why you didn't come.
- Yes, I blame you.

1008
01:12:07,984 --> 01:12:11,170
Don't say that Don,
don't .. it's a jinx.

1009
01:12:11,523 --> 01:12:12,521
I warned you.

1010
01:12:12,994 --> 01:12:14,489
I can't help it. I can't!

1011
01:12:16,112 --> 01:12:18,457
You mean you can't help
being rotten and selfish.

1012
01:12:19,237 --> 01:12:23,706
You'd do anything to gain your own desire
and go on, leaving someone else to pay.

1013
01:12:24,391 --> 01:12:26,487
That's the jinx you put on people.

1014
01:12:28,611 --> 01:12:30,501
I was willing to sacrifice
my life for you.

1015
01:12:31,428 --> 01:12:33,059
Is that selfishness?

1016
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:36,897
Yes, as you were afraid to risk losing
me by telling me you had a husband.

1017
01:12:37,156 --> 01:12:39,405
So, instead you lied and ruined me.

1018
01:12:40,113 --> 01:12:42,419
And your husband .. what
it's cost him to love you.

1019
01:12:42,919 --> 01:12:45,994
Why, you never paid for any happiness
in your whole life. You owe for it!

1020
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:48,177
It cost everybody else but you.

1021
01:12:50,148 --> 01:12:51,815
I can't afford any more.

1022
01:12:52,871 --> 01:12:54,128
There's one thing I know.

1023
01:12:54,228 --> 01:12:57,032
If you're ever going to be anything <i>but
</i>a jinx, you'd better start paying off.

1024
01:12:57,132 --> 01:12:59,130
Because you're in debt
for the rest of your life.

1025
01:13:32,739 --> 01:13:33,953
Mrs Heath.

1026
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:41,406
I was just in to see your husband.
He's been inquiring about you.

1027
01:13:42,781 --> 01:13:44,133
Oh, my husband.

1028
01:13:46,659 --> 01:13:47,928
Oh yes, my husband.

1029
01:13:50,475 --> 01:13:53,938
I must get up today.
- But you can't. It's much too soon.

1030
01:13:55,673 --> 01:13:58,552
I must get up .. I've got
some debts to pay.

1031
01:14:01,146 --> 01:14:05,457
Of course you know, to reopen a play
that's failed, and make a success of it.

1032
01:14:05,665 --> 01:14:08,124
Is next to impossible.
- The play wasn't a failure.

1033
01:14:08,612 --> 01:14:10,313
The only failure was mine to appear.

1034
01:14:10,923 --> 01:14:14,377
I can make that play a success.
- You are quite confident?

1035
01:14:15,725 --> 01:14:17,231
More than confident, I'm positive.

1036
01:14:18,307 --> 01:14:19,362
Why?

1037
01:14:19,751 --> 01:14:21,475
Four very distinct reasons.

1038
01:14:22,004 --> 01:14:24,865
Any one of them so important to
me that it makes failure impossible.

1039
01:14:26,077 --> 01:14:28,483
First, I'm the only actress
suited to that part.

1040
01:14:29,704 --> 01:14:31,723
Second, Don must get his money back.

1041
01:14:33,154 --> 01:14:36,112
Third, I have a husband who's
injured for life because of me.

1042
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:38,957
I must support him.

1043
01:14:39,539 --> 01:14:41,244
And last but most important.

1044
01:14:41,995 --> 01:14:45,624
I found out how to break
my jinx .. by paying my debts.

1045
01:14:48,392 --> 01:14:50,763
Are you strong enough to
start rehearsing Monday?

1046
01:14:52,441 --> 01:14:53,426
Yes.

1047
01:14:55,849 --> 01:14:57,248
I've got to be.

1048
01:14:57,953 --> 01:15:00,785
Monday morning at ten, then.
- Monday morning at ten.

1049
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:02,957
Thanks so much.

1050
01:15:25,569 --> 01:15:26,834
Pardon the coincidence.

1051
01:15:27,285 --> 01:15:28,650
It's not a coincidence, Joyce.

1052
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,950
I've been looking for you.
Thëy told me you'd come here.

1053
01:15:31,476 --> 01:15:32,823
I want to talk to you.

1054
01:15:33,105 --> 01:15:35,279
You were very frank the
last time we talked together.

1055
01:15:36,068 --> 01:15:38,187
Everything I said was the truth.

1056
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:45,488
Well, let me be just as
frank and just as honest.

1057
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:48,860
You are no longer important to me.

1058
01:15:50,182 --> 01:15:52,506
Your importance ended
when the show closed.

1059
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:55,901
You mean, I was just ä means to an end?

1060
01:15:56,728 --> 01:15:58,234
Why not call it that?

1061
01:16:00,792 --> 01:16:03,067
How cheap ..
- No, I ..

1062
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:08,432
I'm rather expensive.
Remember what it cost you?

1063
01:16:27,873 --> 01:16:29,035
Darling ..

1064
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:32,846
Oh darling ..

1065
01:16:33,928 --> 01:16:35,332
Oh darling ..

1066
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:27,736
