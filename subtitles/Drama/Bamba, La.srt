1
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:49,526
Richie, time to get up.

2
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,960
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
SUMMER 1957

3
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:20,140
The harder you work, the more money
you make. What's holding you up?

4
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:26,229
LA BAMBA

5
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:16,297
"Don't you touch me", I says.
I'm tired of being hit by men already.

6
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:21,219
So then I punched him. When he hit
the floor, I thought he was dead.

7
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:27,475
So I says: "If you don't like it,
you can lam it." So he lammed it.

8
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,663
Richie ... Bob?

9
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:52,000
Bob! My son ....

10
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,426
So, Mr. Big Shot,
you finally showed up.

11
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,888
I'm lucky I even found this place.

12
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,850
Rosie, this is my brother Bob.

13
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,522
Why did you wait a year to join us?

14
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:19,694
SOUTH SIDE SCHOOL

15
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:25,784
Bob, watch it.
My guitar, man.

16
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:30,663
Sorry. I didn't know that piece of junk
was so important to you.

17
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:35,377
- Are you kidding? I sleep with it.
- With no hole?

18
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,882
Jersey Joe.

19
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,387
Joe Louis.

20
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,184
You okay?
Can you move it?

21
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:55,397
You all right?
Can you move it?

22
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:03,071
You've grown, asshole.
You're a big sucker for 16.

23
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,908
What's the matter?
You miss me? You should have.

24
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:14,332
- So, what was it like inside?
- Hey, man, the joint is the joint.

25
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:19,963
- Why didn't you come straight home?
- We have no home since Steve died.

26
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:25,260
- Don't be such a dreamer.
- My dreams are pure rock 'n roll.

27
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:44,237
Connie, Irma. Go wash your hands
for dinner. Come on.

28
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:08,553
You little pigs.
I'm gonna tell your mothers on you.

29
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:12,265
You tell them, Rosie.

30
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:22,567
- Mom, what are you doing here?
- We came to work.

31
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:28,490
- I'll take you out of this dump.
- Not before we make some money.

32
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:40,418
- I mean honest money.
- I've been working.

33
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:45,256
Why can't you believe me for once?

34
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,177
Mom, what's going on?

35
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:56,434
We're getting
out of this shit hole tomorrow.

36
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,651
Okay ... Okay.

37
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,250
Don't ...

38
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,671
Oh, please ...

39
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:34,389
Tell me you love me.

40
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:12,594
Why didn't you tell me
this was your first time?

41
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,805
You didn't ask.

42
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:26,316
- You coming, Richie?
- I think I'll wait up a while.

43
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:46,628
You're really something,
you know that?

44
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,151
Say, Richie ... What's up, man?

45
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:22,080
I should ask you.

46
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:28,420
Hey, wait a minute, man.
Did I horn in on something ..?

47
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,006
Just forget it.

48
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:34,592
I thought you'd changed.

49
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:39,055
- I'll miss you. Take care, okay?
- Come on, mom!

50
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:45,895
Come stay with us sometime.
Bob got us a house in Pacoima close to L.A.

51
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:51,359
- Rosa, you'll be late for work.
- My dad wouldn't like it.

52
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:55,530
- I love you.
- Okay. Bye, Connie.

53
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,033
Goodbye.

54
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:03,038
Richie ..?

55
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,294
Bye, Rosie.

56
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,987
Rosa!

57
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:47,248
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
THREE MONTHS LATER

58
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,598
Honey, don't let the baby
fall off the chair.

59
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,646
Richie ..?

60
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,945
Your breakfast is on the table.
I'm off to work. Don't ditch school.

61
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:24,661
Rosie? The baby's with the girls.
See you tonight.

62
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:47,308
Morning, Rosie.
Morning, girls.

63
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,982
Mario ... Mario ...

64
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,908
Bob come in last night?

65
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:08,163
He doesn't spend
much time at home, does he?

66
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:11,082
You do.

67
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:15,337
Yeah, well ... I'm me.

68
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,843
Quiet. Class is in session.

69
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:42,572
- Now, take our your history books.
- Who is the blonde?

70
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:48,119
- I don't know. I think I'm in love.
- Forget it.

71
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:51,456
She's way above your class,
Hi Tone.

72
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,418
You just concentrate
on that audition tonight.

73
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,018
- Hi.
- Hi.

74
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,398
- They call me Hi Tone. You?
- Donna.

75
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,651
- Mind if I walk with you?
- Sure.

76
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:24,322
I mean, no, I don't mind.

77
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:29,994
Donna. That's a nice name.
On second thought, call me Richie.

78
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,624
This is my class.

79
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,962
Where's yours?

80
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,590
In the gym. I got P.E.

81
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:49,055
- You're late ...
- Yeah.

82
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:55,520
Well ... bye ... Donna.

83
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,815
Bye, Hi Tone.

84
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:09,034
Party time.

85
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:18,793
Say, Ed ... you wanna buy a kilo?

86
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:27,260
- You did it, <i>carnalito.</i>
- By the sweat of my balls.

87
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,432
You did it!

88
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,760
Hey, all right ... Come here.

89
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:13,807
Richie, I want you to meet Rudy.
He's the leader of The Silhouettes.

90
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:21,022
Yeah, well, look, Valenzuela ...
Chino says you're a real hot shot.

91
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:24,693
- So ... Whoa. What's that?
- My amp.

92
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:28,530
Looks like something
someone threw away.

93
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:33,702
Well, it's mine now ...
So don't worry about it.

94
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:44,647
No lie. The asshole was smoking weed,
he was smoking milk weed, man!

95
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:56,785
Go on, Rosie, take a hit, man.
Put a little juice in our love life.

96
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:03,833
Baby, I need some action tonight.

97
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:20,308
Come on, baby.
Rosie, come here. I was only joking.

98
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,568
- Rosie, open the door. I'm sorry.
- Just go away.

99
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:34,739
Know what?
Let's get going.

100
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:39,077
- Go where?
- Home. Other people sleep.

101
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:45,291
- Wait. You don't have to split.
- Rosie, we're leaving. Good night.

102
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:50,755
Stick around. Rosie will be out
in a second. Hey, Rosie, come out!

103
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:55,385
Hassle it out with your old lady.

104
00:18:55,468 --> 00:19:00,056
I know what's happening.
Calm down.

105
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,852
- Let's go.
- Good night, Bob.

106
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:14,154
Come on, Rosie.
Open the door.

107
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:22,954
- I said, open the door, goddamn it!
- Stop it. I'm trying to sleep.

108
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:28,501
- Open the goddamn door!
- Just leave me alone. Go away.

109
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:35,300
- Go get drunk, for all I care.
- Okay, baby. You asked for it.

110
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:53,109
Our first gig's next Friday night.
I'll see if you're ready by then.

111
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:09,334
- Rosie, are you okay?
- Yeah, Richie. What do you want?

112
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:14,673
- Come here.
- Nothing.

113
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:18,134
Sorry, my mistake.

114
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:23,598
No, Bob. It's no use.
No more.

115
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:28,728
Don't you ever get enough?
Is this all you want me for?

116
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,732
Mom?

117
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:45,203
- Mom?
- What is it?

118
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:48,623
I made it.
I'm in The Silhouettes.

119
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:53,753
Really, my son?
Oh, Richie, that's wonderful.

120
00:20:55,296 --> 00:21:01,469
Wonderful ...
Who's The Silhouettes?

121
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:07,100
This is not like I expected.
You're not like I expected.

122
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:10,520
I don't have a life here.

123
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,691
You're always gone.
You think I like being here alone?

124
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:18,570
Look, Rosie.
You're not my wife, all right?

125
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:22,073
Stop being such a drag.

126
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:25,827
What the shit's eating you, anyway?

127
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,751
I'm pregnant.

128
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,972
- Aren't you going to say anything?
- What's there to say?

129
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:49,059
It's not my first ... or my last.

130
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,284
You son of a bitch!

131
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:10,955
Oh, my God.
What's going on?

132
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:18,838
Bitch ... You bitch!
Is it my fault you got pregnant?

133
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:26,304
Richie, don't!
It's none of your business.

134
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,312
I am not your whore!

135
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:40,985
- Do you always carry a guitar?
- It's my future.

136
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:45,740
- You're pretty sure of yourself.
- Yeah. Aren't you?

137
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:50,912
- No, I'm the new kid on the block.
- Poor little rich girl.

138
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:54,916
- I'm not rich.
- Right.

139
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:03,383
That's my dad.

140
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:06,594
I want a place like this for mom.

141
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,599
Hi, daddy.

142
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:18,189
I gotta go.

143
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:20,692
Listen, Donna ...

144
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:27,157
I'm playing at a garage party.
Would you like to come? It's my big debut.

145
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,953
It'll be a real gas, kitten.
Please, come.

146
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:40,378
- Okay. I'll have to meet you there.
- No problem.

147
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:44,591
I wrote down the address for you
in case ...

148
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,598
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

149
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:09,240
- Hi, daddy.
- Hi. Who's the big kid?

150
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:14,662
- Just a friend.
- What is he, Italian?

151
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:22,379
Come on, baby. Let's go.
Hurry up.

152
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:44,234
- Mom, look at Richie.
- I see him.

153
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:46,755
- When is Richie gonna sing?
- Pretty soon. Stop asking me.

154
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:55,930
Thank you for attending our dance.
Hope you had an evening to remember.

155
00:25:56,014 --> 00:26:02,645
So, until next time, I, Rudy Castro,
and the guys in the band ...

156
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:07,233
We are The Silhouettes,
bidding you a good night.

157
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:21,289
Good night, Richie.

158
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,711
What do they mean,
not letting you sing?

159
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:31,716
- Who do they want? Elvis?
- I'll make them come around.

160
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,137
They don't know
who they're dealing with.

161
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:41,267
My granddaddy
was a full-bloodied Yaqui Indian.

162
00:26:57,992 --> 00:27:02,122
What's the matter?
Bad dreams?

163
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:08,753
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you up.

164
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:12,215
I just need a place to crash, man.

165
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:17,721
No, man. Here, come on.
Get some rest.

166
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:31,776
Keep your ass to the wall.
I'm so messed up I may take you for Rosie.

167
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,032
I'm sorry ...

168
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:45,790
Where did you get
this picture of Steve?

169
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:49,627
Mom gave it to me after the funeral.

170
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:53,131
Man, I wish I could have been there.

171
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:04,392
However, he was your dad, anyway.
Not mine.

172
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:09,522
Don't forget to turn out the light, okay?
Good night.

173
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:15,737
- Hey, Richie?
- Yeah.

174
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,990
- You been laid yet?
- Oh, man ...

175
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:23,119
I'm serious. I know what your problem is,
man. Sperm pressure.

176
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:27,832
It's scientific. You got hard-ons
all the time, nightmares ...

177
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:30,794
Shut up and go to sleep, okay?

178
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:39,010
A kid your age
needs an authority figure around.

179
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:42,597
Believe me, I know.

180
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:51,731
- I tried to go. Honestly.
- You don't have to apologize.

181
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:57,153
Who's apologizing?
My dad wouldn't let me out. Honest.

182
00:28:57,237 --> 00:29:00,949
Honest.
I really wanted to be there.

183
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:06,621
Cowboy Palace.

184
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,210
I can't do it. Richie's a minor.

185
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:15,046
- He'll be singing, not drinking.
- Yeah.

186
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:18,508
Rock 'n roll to a bunch of cowboys.
Come on.

187
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:23,805
My husband drank himself to death in here.
You owe this boy something.

188
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:29,686
- I should have brought my drummer.
- I'll keep the beat for you.

189
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:34,232
They got drums.
What are you gonna play?

190
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:38,278
Boney Maronie?
To these shit-stompers?

191
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:47,829
- Howard, they're here.
- Okay, cut the jukebox.

192
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:55,628
Testing. One, two, three ...
Good to see you folks. You having fun?

193
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:03,553
A local boy is making his debut
right here. Let's hear it for ...

194
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:06,890
Rickie Ricardo Valenzuela!

195
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:18,443
Howdy.

196
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:27,077
Here's one out of Lubbock, Texas.

197
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,829
Follow me.

198
00:31:56,624 --> 00:32:02,297
We're rocking and rolling.
Didn't I tell you? We don't need no band.

199
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,675
We play the bars with the drummer.

200
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:09,471
Me, for instance.
I'm talking about making money!

201
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:14,893
I'm talking about making my music.
That's all I care about, man.

202
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:23,360
What you need is exposure.
A big place where you can sell tickets.

203
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:26,279
- Think big.
- You wanna be my manager?

204
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:31,618
I can do it. I can get The American
Legion Hall. Steve was a veteran.

205
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:36,122
You don't think I can do it?
You can be my flunky.

206
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:42,045
- No, thanks. Anybody but Bob.
- What does that mean?

207
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:45,382
You just take care of Rosie,
okay, stud?

208
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:49,636
- Try staying home for a change.
- Listen, punk ...

209
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:55,517
Stop it. Richie, don't be so "hi tone."
You're your brother's keeper.

210
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,437
You never heard of that?

211
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:04,442
- Morning, Connie, Richie.
- Morning.

212
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,365
You missed a great show last night.
Richie was wonderful.

213
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:15,286
- Really? I'm not surprised.
- I'm flying this coop.

214
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:19,541
- Catch you all later.
- I'm late for work.

215
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:24,754
What did I do with my purse?
"Flying the coop" ... That's it!

216
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:29,634
"Richard Valenzuela
and His Flying Guitar."

217
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:45,025
- This is it. What do you think?
- This is beautiful, man.

218
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:47,318
We'll raise the roof off this joint.

219
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:51,322
You're dreaming.
They wouldn't even let us in.

220
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:57,662
- I told you. My mom set it all up.
- Does your Mom run this band?

221
00:33:57,746 --> 00:34:02,500
- We need all the breaks we can get.
- No dice.

222
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:07,672
I decide what's best for the band
and this ain't it. So let's beat it.

223
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:11,134
What's his problem, man?

224
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:16,931
Are you guys coming or what?

225
00:34:21,394 --> 00:34:24,773
I guess it's "what".

226
00:34:32,614 --> 00:34:37,077
- What's going on?
- Show business, my son.

227
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:42,207
Show business? These look like shit.
A monkey can draw better than this.

228
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,958
Oh, yeah?

229
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:51,800
Should have kept my mouth shut.

230
00:34:51,883 --> 00:34:57,514
Every wall, every liquor store,
every telephone pole in town.

231
00:34:57,597 --> 00:35:00,809
Hit them all. Now, tear buns!

232
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:12,487
<i>Richard Valenzuela
and His Flying Guitar ...</i>

233
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:26,251
Hang up some of that crepe paper
across there, okay?

234
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:30,130
Those chairs don't go there, Felipe.

235
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:37,679
You look really handsome, Richie.
The girls will go crazy over you.

236
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:42,183
There's only one girl I care about.
Nobody you'd know.

237
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:48,773
- Is everything in order?
- Perfect. Thanks, Rosie.

238
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:53,903
- We're gonna pack the place.
- I hope so. This is our rent money.

239
00:35:56,698 --> 00:36:00,994
One of these days I'll buy you
the house of your dreams. I promise.

240
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:04,581
Tell me about it.
Where is Bob?

241
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:48,792
- 30 cents. Here's your change.
- 10 cases.

242
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:53,171
Counting the door that's 150 bucks.
Lelo, we gotta do this again, man.

243
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:14,943
Did you find Bob?
Did you look?

244
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:30,208
- Pretty good, huh?
- He's great.

245
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:34,546
- What'll you have?
- A Coke.

246
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:43,221
Here's a little number for
the criminal element here tonight.

247
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:47,183
And you know who you are.

248
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:17,922
Look at my Richie.
He's shining like a star.

249
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:23,178
Look at Bob.

250
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:34,189
You're drunk, Bob.
Give me that bottle.

251
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:54,042
Yeah, Richie!

252
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:05,845
That's my brother!

253
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:08,056
Asshole!

254
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:25,740
Stop!

255
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:30,495
Stop it!

256
00:39:57,063 --> 00:40:01,860
Why, Bob?
How could you do this to Richie?

257
00:40:01,943 --> 00:40:08,700
- To Richie? I did this to me!
- Always thinking of others first.

258
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:13,496
- Shut your goddamn mouth.
- Don't take it out on Rosie.

259
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:20,211
You don't understand, man.
You don't understand a goddamn thing!

260
00:40:22,964 --> 00:40:27,260
You think the whole fucking world
revolves around you?

261
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,437
VALENZUELA 738

262
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:50,075
- Is this where you live?
- No.

263
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:53,912
I live down the street.

264
00:40:53,995 --> 00:40:58,875
- Hop in. I'll take you home.
- Why don't we go for a drive?

265
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:01,002
Okay. You drive.

266
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:09,761
Well, what do you think?

267
00:41:09,844 --> 00:41:13,640
Not bad for a birthday present.

268
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:20,271
- And you say you're not rich?
- My dad sells cars.

269
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:24,275
Can I help it
if he knows his business?

270
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:28,780
He just didn't want me
walking home any more.

271
00:41:28,863 --> 00:41:30,865
Because of me?

272
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:38,540
How come you've been
avoiding me?

273
00:41:38,623 --> 00:41:42,210
Was it that blowout at the dance?

274
00:41:42,293 --> 00:41:45,714
Then what's the problem?

275
00:41:47,298 --> 00:41:51,553
- My dad.
- So I can't ask you out on a date?

276
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:59,269
Why don't you ask me?

277
00:41:59,352 --> 00:42:04,024
I got my own wheels now.
Who cares what my father thinks?

278
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:20,290
COLUMBIA PICTURES

279
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:40,435
Get your ass in gear.
We still got a lot of places to stop at.

280
00:42:40,518 --> 00:42:43,813
Hey, look at this.

281
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:48,151
It's Woody Woodpecker.
And Buzz Buzzard.

282
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:53,448
This is the real stuff. They make
cartoons out of these things.

283
00:42:53,531 --> 00:42:57,869
- It's kiddie stuff.
- Finders, keepers.

284
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:27,107
- Hello. Is Richard Valenzuela here?
- He lives here. Why?

285
00:43:46,584 --> 00:43:50,171
Happy Birthday.

286
00:43:50,255 --> 00:43:54,300
- That's good.
- This man wants to talk to you.

287
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:57,178
Hi, Richie.
Can I call you Richie?

288
00:43:57,262 --> 00:44:01,433
Bob Keene,
president of Del-Fi Records.

289
00:44:01,516 --> 00:44:07,105
- I don't speak Spanish.
- But we can speak business.

290
00:44:07,188 --> 00:44:14,279
Let me just say, I really dig your
music and would like to record it.

291
00:44:14,362 --> 00:44:17,198
What do you say?

292
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:23,830
Welcome to Del-Fi Records.
I work out of the basement.

293
00:44:23,913 --> 00:44:29,294
- This is your recording studio?
- The Ampex and mikes are excellent.

294
00:44:29,377 --> 00:44:35,133
What more do you need?
Relax, Richie. This is just for starters.

295
00:44:35,216 --> 00:44:40,180
We'll start off easy.
Play some riffs. Move on to vocals.

296
00:44:40,263 --> 00:44:46,644
- When you're ready, we'll record.
- Today? What about my band?

297
00:44:48,396 --> 00:44:51,983
Frankly, I can't use any of them.
Is that a problem?

298
00:44:52,067 --> 00:44:55,987
Yeah. They're my buddies.

299
00:44:56,071 --> 00:45:00,575
Thank you. Excuse me.

300
00:45:00,658 --> 00:45:05,997
Richie. Wait a minute, man.
Look, I understand about friendship.

301
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:11,461
I'm being honest here. Not everybody
gets a shot at the brass ring.

302
00:45:11,544 --> 00:45:17,092
Ask yourself what's more important.
Your friends ... or your music?

303
00:45:35,443 --> 00:45:39,114
My family.

304
00:46:31,624 --> 00:46:35,003
- Bob, is that you?
- Come here, man.

305
00:46:39,007 --> 00:46:44,846
- Hey! Did you trace this?
- This is free hand. Look at this.

306
00:46:46,348 --> 00:46:49,768
Art contest, man.
$500 in prizes.

307
00:46:49,851 --> 00:46:54,064
- Think I should enter it?
- Yeah, man. Go for broke.

308
00:47:17,003 --> 00:47:19,005
Rosie!

309
00:47:59,963 --> 00:48:03,299
Fantastic.

310
00:48:23,945 --> 00:48:27,991
I wasn't there when it happened.
But in the dream I am.

311
00:48:30,118 --> 00:48:35,498
My best friend got killed.
Crushed by one of those falling planes.

312
00:48:36,958 --> 00:48:42,464
- Where were you that day?
- My grandfather's funeral.

313
00:48:42,547 --> 00:48:45,967
I guess his death saved my life.

314
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:50,472
Thank you.

315
00:48:52,807 --> 00:48:57,979
My mom says it means I was saved
for something really special.

316
00:48:58,063 --> 00:49:01,608
- Know what it is?
- Rock 'n roll?

317
00:49:03,985 --> 00:49:08,406
Yeah. I'm gonna be a star.

318
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:12,118
Stars don't fall out of the sky,
do they?

319
00:49:17,582 --> 00:49:22,629
- Dump garbage the rest of my life?
- How will you support the baby?

320
00:49:22,712 --> 00:49:26,758
Drawing Woody Woodpecker?
Get that junk out of here.

321
00:49:26,841 --> 00:49:32,347
- You don't respect any shit I do.
- What about your respect for me?

322
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:48,905
I almost have to rape her
just to have sex.

323
00:49:51,032 --> 00:49:54,244
To her it's dirty.

324
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:03,044
Look, it's cool if you move in, -

325
00:50:03,128 --> 00:50:08,633
- but when the baby comes
shouldn't you be with Rosie?

326
00:50:08,717 --> 00:50:14,597
My old man wasn't around when I
was born. Why should I be?

327
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:18,184
- Richie!
- Figure it out, man.

328
00:50:18,268 --> 00:50:21,896
There you are.
Bob Keene called.

329
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:27,610
You're recording at Gold Star Studios
on Wednesday. In Hollywood.

330
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:33,408
Did you hear me? That means he'll
put you under contract with Del-Fi.

331
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:43,084
Oh, Richie, I'm so happy!

332
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:46,254
It's only the beginning, my son.

333
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:51,593
Bob has great news, too.
Tell her, man.

334
00:50:53,553 --> 00:50:59,184
That art contest? I won.
500 dollars in prizes.

335
00:50:59,267 --> 00:51:02,520
Great.
With the baby coming ...

336
00:51:02,604 --> 00:51:05,732
In art lessons!

337
00:51:07,317 --> 00:51:11,404
See, they gave me a drafting table.

338
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,578
All our dreams are gonna come true.
I just know it.

339
00:51:20,663 --> 00:51:23,833
GOLD STAR
RECORDING STUDIO

340
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:37,305
Cut, Richie.
Let's start again.

341
00:51:44,145 --> 00:51:47,816
Cut. Don't rewrite the song.
Do it like the first time.

342
00:52:00,286 --> 00:52:04,833
Cut!
Richie, that was our fault.

343
00:52:18,888 --> 00:52:24,561
Cut. More right on, but I like
that "little darling" line better.

344
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:41,077
I don't see what's wrong.
That's the way I sing.

345
00:52:41,161 --> 00:52:46,291
Each take has to be identical
so that we can edit later.

346
00:52:46,374 --> 00:52:52,464
This isn't Mexico. I lived there.
I know the tradition of the song.

347
00:52:52,547 --> 00:52:57,260
I've never even been to Mexico.
My music is my music.

348
00:53:00,305 --> 00:53:03,350
Look, how many more takes?

349
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:05,894
As many as it takes, okay?

350
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:23,661
Cut! That was good.
Same energy. Just try it again.

351
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:44,474
- Shall I get a new roll of tape?
- No.

352
00:53:44,557 --> 00:53:48,436
I think we got him.
I can cut something here.

353
00:53:49,604 --> 00:53:54,275
Nice work, Richie. 60 takes, man.
How's the throat?

354
00:53:54,359 --> 00:54:00,031
- I think we got it.
- I didn't hear a difference in one.

355
00:54:00,115 --> 00:54:06,329
- I'm ready to go home.
- I want to discuss one thing, okay?

356
00:54:11,126 --> 00:54:14,713
- What is it?
- Your professional name.

357
00:54:14,796 --> 00:54:21,386
From now on, it's R-I-T-C-H-I-E.
I got a new last name for you, too.

358
00:54:21,469 --> 00:54:25,140
Valens with an S. Ritchie Valens.

359
00:54:25,223 --> 00:54:28,351
- How does that grab you?
- I don't like it.

360
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:33,523
That's for shit, man.
Valenzuela was our dad's name.

361
00:54:33,606 --> 00:54:38,862
It's no big deal. People in this business
change names like wives.

362
00:54:38,945 --> 00:54:43,033
Even me. Mine is Kuhn.

363
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:47,495
Look, trust me on this one.

364
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:50,206
Let's go.

365
00:54:54,502 --> 00:54:56,588
Thanks.

366
00:54:56,671 --> 00:55:01,468
It could have been worse.
You could have been Ricky Zuela.

367
00:55:08,933 --> 00:55:12,437
- Hello?
- Hello? Is Donna in?

368
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:16,107
No. I'm her father.
Can I help you?

369
00:55:16,191 --> 00:55:18,568
Daddy? Is it Ritchie?

370
00:55:20,695 --> 00:55:25,909
Yeah. Could you tell her
that Ritchie called again, please?

371
00:55:25,992 --> 00:55:29,037
Yeah, okay.

372
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:42,592
He plays that goddamn jungle music.
Need I say more?

373
00:55:42,676 --> 00:55:46,388
Honey, you said it wasn't serious.

374
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:50,934
I hate dad when he acts like that.

375
00:55:51,017 --> 00:55:54,521
<i>Good morning, all you survivors.
Call now. I'd love to talk to you.</i>

376
00:55:54,604 --> 00:56:00,318
<i>We got evicted.
We're sleeping in the car.</i>

377
00:56:00,402 --> 00:56:06,825
Your wife is pregnant and sleeping
in the car? What kind of car?

378
00:56:06,908 --> 00:56:08,993
<i>A Rolls Royce.</i>

379
00:56:10,578 --> 00:56:14,290
Your mom listens to KFWB, right?

380
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:20,588
Ritchie Valens' mom listens, too.
She must be proud of her boy today.

381
00:56:20,672 --> 00:56:25,010
His song is headed up the charts
with a bullet.

382
00:56:25,093 --> 00:56:29,014
Ritchie Valens' "Come On Let's Go".

383
00:56:31,474 --> 00:56:35,020
- Bob, how are you?
- Pretty good.

384
00:56:35,103 --> 00:56:41,026
- Valens ... French, right?
- How did you know?

385
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:47,657
- Come on, man. He's a barrio kid.
- Not for long.

386
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:51,578
- Pretty good.
- I know.

387
00:56:58,543 --> 00:57:04,132
Okay, everybody, keep it down.
That's my Ritchie on the radio.

388
00:57:05,842 --> 00:57:10,305
- Hey, Connie, how about a beer?
- No, I'm working. I'll get you one.

389
00:57:23,902 --> 00:57:27,489
<i>No, I'm sorry.
Donna's studying.</i>

390
00:57:29,949 --> 00:57:33,578
Pizza fans, here's a special contest
to kick off summer.

391
00:57:33,661 --> 00:57:36,623
We have a mystery guest.

392
00:57:36,706 --> 00:57:39,959
- Say hello, Mr. Guest.
- Hello.

393
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:47,092
Now, what does our guest have
in common with our vice president?

394
00:57:47,175 --> 00:57:51,888
Identify our guest
and win 12 fresh hot pizzas.

395
00:57:51,971 --> 00:57:56,267
Our guest will deliver the pizzas -

396
00:57:56,351 --> 00:58:01,356
- and have a pizza party
at your place, free, from KFWB.

397
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:18,665
- <i>No, Donna's not here.</i>
- Thank you.

398
00:58:18,748 --> 00:58:22,919
- <i>She's out on a date.</i>
- Yeah ... right.

399
00:58:33,513 --> 00:58:37,809
- Yes, may I help you?
- May I see Donna?

400
00:58:37,892 --> 00:58:41,896
Please. I know she's here.

401
00:58:43,648 --> 00:58:45,942
Just one moment.

402
00:58:48,737 --> 00:58:51,197
Donna ...

403
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:58,830
It's Ritchie. You better not lead him on.
You know how your father is.

404
00:59:04,753 --> 00:59:08,048
Hi, Ritchie.

405
00:59:09,215 --> 00:59:12,969
Can we take a walk?

406
00:59:16,765 --> 00:59:19,726
No, I can't.

407
00:59:21,144 --> 00:59:25,732
Let's not beat around the bush.
Are you seeing other guys?

408
00:59:25,982 --> 00:59:29,569
Yeah, I've been out a few times.
What's wrong with that?

409
00:59:29,652 --> 00:59:35,617
- You're my girl.
- When am I supposed to see you?

410
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:39,913
I can't just tag along.
All those other girls ...

411
00:59:39,996 --> 00:59:43,708
I don't care about those girls.

412
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:47,837
What am I supposed to do?

413
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:50,965
You don't have time for me now.

414
00:59:51,049 --> 00:59:53,718
You want to break it off?

415
00:59:59,516 --> 01:00:03,561
I don't know what I want anymore.

416
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:09,150
- I'll see you around some time.
- Ritchie ...

417
01:01:14,507 --> 01:01:20,347
<i>I've never been the same
'Cause I love my girl</i>

418
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:25,477
<i>Donna oh where can you be</i>

419
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:29,230
<i>Where can you be</i>

420
01:01:29,314 --> 01:01:34,736
<i>Oh Donna
Oh Donna ...</i>

421
01:01:42,327 --> 01:01:46,373
Hello? Sorry.

422
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,670
That's it. That's your song.

423
01:01:51,753 --> 01:01:55,965
- <i>Thought you'd like to hear it.</i>
- It's beautiful.

424
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:59,219
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Yeah.

425
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:08,019
I think I know what your problem is.
It's time we did something about it.

426
01:02:08,103 --> 01:02:11,231
- Let's go.
- Where to?

427
01:02:11,314 --> 01:02:16,194
Let's just go. I should have
done this a long time ago. Hop on.

428
01:02:17,737 --> 01:02:22,909
- Done what?
- Gotten you some tail, man.

429
01:02:28,707 --> 01:02:31,876
TIJUANA

430
01:02:37,298 --> 01:02:42,470
Come on, Ritchie with a T,
I'll show you the best part of TJ.

431
01:02:45,056 --> 01:02:48,101
- Ritchie, check it out.
- Don't worry.

432
01:02:48,184 --> 01:02:53,314
It smells like fish,
but it tastes like chicken.

433
01:02:54,607 --> 01:03:02,115
Your manager should be getting you
some tail. You're his meal ticket.

434
01:03:02,198 --> 01:03:07,495
- Hey, come on. Change the record.
- Look, man. "Ritchie Valens."

435
01:03:09,581 --> 01:03:13,626
No one will suspect you're Mexican.

436
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:16,421
It's an insult to Steve's memory.

437
01:03:16,504 --> 01:03:21,468
Steve was so gung-ho American,
he'd be proud of anything I do. Lay off.

438
01:03:21,551 --> 01:03:26,222
- It's my name.
- Yeah, it's your name, man.

439
01:03:45,533 --> 01:03:49,120
- What did she say?
- She liked your big ...

440
01:03:50,413 --> 01:03:53,958
- What do you think?
- Looks like a high school prom.

441
01:03:54,042 --> 01:03:57,295
Only this prom puts out.

442
01:04:26,741 --> 01:04:28,993
Oh, baby.

443
01:04:29,077 --> 01:04:32,997
Look at those bongos!
Get in there.

444
01:04:33,081 --> 01:04:37,335
I can see fine.

445
01:04:37,419 --> 01:04:41,965
Pick one you like. They'll like you.
It's guaranteed.

446
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:52,392
I don't know.
It's hard to choose.

447
01:04:52,475 --> 01:04:56,813
Take two, man.
It's on me.

448
01:05:04,779 --> 01:05:08,533
- "La Bamba."
- Ritchie, come here, man.

449
01:05:08,616 --> 01:05:12,620
- I brought you here to get laid.
- Later.

450
01:05:35,435 --> 01:05:40,065
- And what do they call you?
- Rosalina.

451
01:06:09,511 --> 01:06:12,514
I'm coming.

452
01:06:19,396 --> 01:06:21,439
Rosie!

453
01:06:21,731 --> 01:06:24,776
Connie, I need your help.

454
01:06:24,859 --> 01:06:29,906
It's the baby?
Where's Bob, for God's sake?

455
01:06:33,284 --> 01:06:36,746
I'm gonna get Ritchie, okay?

456
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:39,708
It's gonna be okay.

457
01:07:42,437 --> 01:07:45,440
<i>Yo no speako Espanol.</i>

458
01:08:00,121 --> 01:08:04,167
What's the idea of leaving me alone
with this old man?

459
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:09,881
I had some business to take care of.
You were sleeping it off, stud.

460
01:08:09,964 --> 01:08:14,719
- Was I that drunk?
- Screwed, blewed and tattooed.

461
01:08:14,803 --> 01:08:18,223
Well, at least tattooed, anyway.

462
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:22,977
He wants us to eat breakfast.

463
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,909
I never had snake before.

464
01:08:39,285 --> 01:08:42,330
It's not bad.

465
01:08:49,504 --> 01:08:51,881
What's he saying?

466
01:08:51,965 --> 01:08:58,346
He says, "life is a snake. A snake
crawling out of its own dead skin."

467
01:08:59,222 --> 01:09:02,350
"Like a dream."

468
01:09:04,019 --> 01:09:08,732
He's a <i>curandero.</i>
A healer and a wise man.

469
01:09:08,815 --> 01:09:14,696
He's sort of my spiritual father.
I've been coming to him for years.

470
01:09:19,617 --> 01:09:23,371
He's giving you that.

471
01:09:24,873 --> 01:09:28,084
"To live is to sleep."

472
01:09:30,879 --> 01:09:35,300
"To die is to awaken."

473
01:09:36,885 --> 01:09:40,472
I told him about your nightmares.

474
01:09:40,555 --> 01:09:44,851
That talisman will help,
if you believe in it.

475
01:09:51,775 --> 01:09:56,071
What is all this?

476
01:09:56,154 --> 01:09:58,865
Mexico.

477
01:10:07,624 --> 01:10:12,170
Mexico? You went to Tijuana
without telling anybody?

478
01:10:12,253 --> 01:10:15,674
A fine pair of idiots.

479
01:10:15,757 --> 01:10:20,720
I could expect this from Bob,
but not you, Ritchie.

480
01:10:20,804 --> 01:10:24,182
So what did you do?
Drink the night away?

481
01:10:24,265 --> 01:10:27,018
It was my fault.
I took him there.

482
01:10:27,102 --> 01:10:30,939
- How's Rosie?
- In the hospital, where else?

483
01:10:31,981 --> 01:10:37,696
She was all alone. I drove her myself.
She was in labor all day.

484
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:42,075
Do you hear me?
Do you care about anything?

485
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:45,537
Go ahead.
Go play with your bike!

486
01:10:50,542 --> 01:10:54,379
- Did Rosie have a boy or a girl?
- She had a girl.

487
01:10:54,462 --> 01:10:57,841
We named her Brenda.

488
01:10:57,924 --> 01:11:02,137
- What's this?
- Bob.

489
01:11:06,182 --> 01:11:11,896
<i>Well darling
Now that you're gone</i>

490
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:17,861
<i>I don't know
What I'll do</i>

491
01:11:17,944 --> 01:11:21,698
<i>Oh it's gone</i>

492
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:28,163
<i>And all my love for you</i>

493
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:38,923
<i>I had a girl
Donna was her name</i>

494
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:44,637
<i>Since she left me
I've never been the same</i>

495
01:11:44,721 --> 01:11:48,475
<i>'Cause I love my girl</i>

496
01:11:48,558 --> 01:11:54,898
<i>Donna oh where can you be</i>

497
01:11:54,981 --> 01:11:58,151
<i>Where can you be</i>

498
01:11:58,234 --> 01:12:04,157
<i>Oh Donna
Oh Donna ...</i>

499
01:12:23,301 --> 01:12:26,596
<i>That's beautiful, Ritchie.
That's the one.</i>

500
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:30,892
In September
we do the Pacific Ocean Park -

501
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:34,938
- and Santa Monica Civic Auditorium.

502
01:12:35,021 --> 01:12:39,901
Followed by ... Are you listening?

503
01:12:39,984 --> 01:12:45,407
A week's booking in San Francisco.
Now, we fly up for that one.

504
01:12:47,033 --> 01:12:51,705
- Fly? No, I'd rather drive.
- Please. It's a long drive.

505
01:12:51,788 --> 01:12:56,668
I don't care. I never fly.
I have my reasons.

506
01:12:56,751 --> 01:13:00,213
All right.
I'll see what I can do.

507
01:13:00,296 --> 01:13:05,677
We still need another single to go
along with Donna. How about "Susie"?

508
01:13:07,595 --> 01:13:11,850
- How about "La Bamba?"
- It's not rock and roll.

509
01:13:11,933 --> 01:13:17,313
It's a folk song. I don't want
to offend anybody. And it's in Spanish.

510
01:13:17,397 --> 01:13:21,317
- That's how I want to sing it.
- You gotta be crazy.

511
01:13:21,401 --> 01:13:24,029
It'll work.
Just let me try.

512
01:13:24,112 --> 01:13:28,950
Even assuming the other side was
a throwaway, what about the lyrics?

513
01:13:29,034 --> 01:13:32,078
You can't speak the language.

514
01:13:32,162 --> 01:13:37,083
If Nat King Cole can sing in Spanish,
so can I. Come on, Bob-o.

515
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:40,754
What do you say, huh?

516
01:13:40,837 --> 01:13:43,298
Bob-o?

517
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:50,305
Okay, now, smile. Great!

518
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:53,993
- It drives like a dream.
- Beats taking the train.

519
01:14:54,077 --> 01:14:58,748
- How much did it cost?
- You don't want to know.

520
01:14:58,832 --> 01:15:04,629
But if all goes well
in Philadelphia, it's yours.

521
01:15:04,713 --> 01:15:10,969
- We're going to Philadelphia?
- "American Bandstand".

522
01:15:11,052 --> 01:15:15,056
- Really?
- Ritchie, we fly up for that.

523
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:18,184
Okay?

524
01:15:23,189 --> 01:15:25,734
Let's go!

525
01:15:31,489 --> 01:15:37,245
- I thought you didn't like to fly.
- I don't. But I love driving fast.

526
01:15:37,328 --> 01:15:44,085
Let me in, damn it! I want to see
my daughter. I'm her father!

527
01:15:44,169 --> 01:15:50,717
- You're a goddamn drunk.
- Stop it. Have you gone crazy?

528
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:56,306
- I've finally had it.
- I want to see my daughter.

529
01:15:56,389 --> 01:16:01,311
- Not in your condition.
- I was crazy about you. No more.

530
01:16:01,394 --> 01:16:06,232
- I want my wife.
- He wants a love slave.

531
01:16:06,316 --> 01:16:11,696
Sober up and see her tomorrow.
Now, go downstairs and pass out.

532
01:16:12,739 --> 01:16:16,618
I've got enough to worry about
with Ritchie!

533
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:21,998
You always worry more about Ritchie.

534
01:16:22,082 --> 01:16:25,835
What about me?

535
01:16:25,919 --> 01:16:31,216
I know you don't give a goddamn
about me. You had me turned in!

536
01:16:31,299 --> 01:16:36,346
You had me locked up. You think
I could ever forgive you for that?

537
01:16:38,973 --> 01:16:43,228
Little bitch! You can't keep me
from seeing my kid.

538
01:16:43,311 --> 01:16:46,648
This is my house.
I'll kick you out!

539
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:54,989
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

540
01:16:56,408 --> 01:17:01,996
- You see anything?
- Yeah, it's a long way down, boy.

541
01:17:06,918 --> 01:17:09,462
You okay?

542
01:17:12,632 --> 01:17:19,973
Yeah. You know, I always believed
I would die in a plane crash.

543
01:17:20,056 --> 01:17:25,311
That's a hell of a thing to say
while we're still in the air.

544
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:31,067
Well, it's do or die, man.
"American Bandstand", Philadelphia.

545
01:17:31,151 --> 01:17:34,029
Drink this. Vodka.

546
01:17:34,112 --> 01:17:36,990
Straight.

547
01:17:37,073 --> 01:17:42,454
<i>Away we go. You're all comfortably
seated, I presume? Excellent.</i>

548
01:17:42,537 --> 01:17:48,752
<i>Let's have a nice greeting for a man
making his debut on our show:</i>

549
01:17:48,835 --> 01:17:52,714
<i>Here's Ritchie Valens.</i>

550
01:18:34,589 --> 01:18:38,385
- What do you want?
- Come on, I got money here.

551
01:18:38,468 --> 01:18:41,680
- I don't want your money.
- What the hell?

552
01:18:41,763 --> 01:18:44,516
I was watching that.
Put it back on.

553
01:18:44,599 --> 01:18:49,270
- You've had enough, buddy.
- That dude's my brother.

554
01:18:49,354 --> 01:18:53,233
Yeah, and I'm your Irish uncle, too.
Leave it off.

555
01:19:24,556 --> 01:19:30,854
- So what did you think of Ritchie?
- I can't believe he sang "Donna".

556
01:19:30,937 --> 01:19:36,609
- You are so lucky.
- Who are you taking to the dance?

557
01:19:45,744 --> 01:19:49,414
- Hi, kitten.
- Hi.

558
01:19:49,497 --> 01:19:53,668
- So where's your car?
- It was a loaner. My dad sold it.

559
01:19:53,752 --> 01:19:59,007
- Hop in.
- See you later.

560
01:20:04,929 --> 01:20:10,435
Hi, Ritchie. Can I have your photograph,
I mean, autograph?

561
01:20:10,518 --> 01:20:14,773
Can we have your autograph?

562
01:20:14,856 --> 01:20:18,234
I'll get you Donna's, too.
Sign it.

563
01:20:20,862 --> 01:20:24,741
- Just like old times, huh?
- I really missed you.

564
01:20:24,824 --> 01:20:27,869
I've missed you, too.

565
01:20:33,291 --> 01:20:38,004
- So how's school?
- Not the same without you.

566
01:20:38,088 --> 01:20:44,135
- When are you coming back?
- I'm booked all winter and fall.

567
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:47,764
I'll be in The Big Apple.

568
01:20:47,847 --> 01:20:51,559
I'm really happy for you, Ritchie.

569
01:20:51,643 --> 01:20:56,272
All your success and everything.
You really deserve it.

570
01:20:56,356 --> 01:21:00,944
I'm flying.
I'm really flying.

571
01:21:10,495 --> 01:21:13,206
This way ...

572
01:21:16,084 --> 01:21:19,045
Oh, Ritchie.

573
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:36,312
- It's yours, mom.
- It's mine, Ritchie?

574
01:21:44,529 --> 01:21:48,074
Come on ...

575
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:53,288
- Wow, is this where we're gonna live?
- It's like a castle.

576
01:21:53,371 --> 01:21:55,165
This is home.

577
01:21:58,084 --> 01:22:03,631
Okay, that's the garage.
And over there is the guest house.

578
01:22:06,801 --> 01:22:10,638
Look at it. Isn't it nice?

579
01:22:10,722 --> 01:22:15,101
Right here is where we'll put
the swimming pool.

580
01:22:15,185 --> 01:22:20,440
- The girls can't swim. No pool.
- Oh, okay.

581
01:22:24,319 --> 01:22:27,864
- Make it an automatic dishwasher.
- No problem.

582
01:22:27,947 --> 01:22:33,161
But after we fly back east.
10 day tour. 13 cities.

583
01:22:33,244 --> 01:22:39,709
Including a spot on national television.
So, congratulations.

584
01:22:39,793 --> 01:22:42,462
Here are the keys
to your new home.

585
01:22:42,545 --> 01:22:48,051
Oh, Ritchie. This is better
than "Queen For a Day".

586
01:22:48,134 --> 01:22:52,180
Oh, Ritchie.
You're the best.

587
01:22:53,515 --> 01:22:57,936
ROCK 'N ROLL SHOW
BROOKLYN

588
01:22:59,396 --> 01:23:04,192
STAGE AND SCREEN SHOW
ALAN FREED IN PERSON

589
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:32,387
- What's the matter? Nervous?
- Hey, I'm just a kid from Pacoima.

590
01:24:21,728 --> 01:24:26,316
- You're gonna knock them dead.
- <i>Eddie Cochrane, a wonderful man.</i>

591
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:32,405
And now for you rock cats, another
wonderful man: Mr. Jackie Wilson!

592
01:24:34,616 --> 01:24:38,244
Yeah.
Eddie, you were great, man.

593
01:24:39,913 --> 01:24:44,167
It's that live New York audience, man.
Rock 'n roll is an addiction.

594
01:25:05,522 --> 01:25:09,901
- Here you are, Ritchie.
- Where else? The kid's got taste.

595
01:25:09,984 --> 01:25:15,990
- I need you. A singer got sick.
- This circus gave him malnutrition.

596
01:25:16,074 --> 01:25:20,578
You're going on right after Jackie Wilson.
You can do it.

597
01:25:20,662 --> 01:25:25,166
- Good luck.
- They're all waiting for you.

598
01:26:43,328 --> 01:26:48,333
If they love you, they want to kill you.
If they don't, same difference.

599
01:26:53,254 --> 01:27:00,428
And here he is, America's newest
rock 'n roll sensation ...

600
01:27:00,512 --> 01:27:05,266
The California kid ...
Ritchie Valens.

601
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:21,116
Here's a bit of a rattlesnake.

602
01:29:37,585 --> 01:29:41,840
This is the last time
I wanna go away for Christmas.

603
01:29:41,923 --> 01:29:45,010
No, I mean it, Bob-o.

604
01:29:45,093 --> 01:29:47,846
Surprise!

605
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:56,855
Merry Christmas, Hi Tone.
I missed you.

606
01:30:01,443 --> 01:30:04,529
Okay, go ahead
and open something.

607
01:30:04,612 --> 01:30:07,032
Just the little kids!

608
01:30:18,043 --> 01:30:22,547
- Look at this food. Are you hungry?
- I could eat a horse.

609
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:27,093
- Help yourself.
- I don't know where to start.

610
01:30:28,803 --> 01:30:32,432
- Good to see you.
- Seven & Seven?

611
01:30:32,515 --> 01:30:37,312
- What about you?
- On the wagon. The garbage wagon.

612
01:30:38,772 --> 01:30:44,486
$5 a week and all you can eat.
With all this food, I'm staying.

613
01:30:47,405 --> 01:30:54,579
Hey, where's mom's new dress?
The one I asked you to buy her?

614
01:30:54,662 --> 01:30:59,542
You're the asshole with the money.
Why don't you buy it yourself?

615
01:31:05,006 --> 01:31:10,220
He's been on the wagon for a month now.
He's meaner when he's drunk.

616
01:31:10,303 --> 01:31:13,264
Come on, help yourself.

617
01:31:13,348 --> 01:31:18,269
Everybody into the living room.
I got a present for Ritchie.

618
01:31:33,368 --> 01:31:39,582
I feel like I just got mauled
by King Kong. Okay, let's party.

619
01:31:39,666 --> 01:31:43,044
My Ritchie is home!

620
01:31:59,936 --> 01:32:04,315
- Are you okay, Bob?
- Sure, I'm okay.

621
01:32:04,399 --> 01:32:07,986
Mom's asking for you.

622
01:32:08,069 --> 01:32:13,199
Is she afraid I'm drunk? I had one sip
and it tastes like piss. Want it?

623
01:32:13,283 --> 01:32:16,661
Yeah. Thanks.

624
01:32:33,887 --> 01:32:37,432
What's your problem, man?

625
01:32:39,267 --> 01:32:46,358
Old Steve always said you were
gonna be somebody. I bought it, too.

626
01:32:46,441 --> 01:32:51,196
If that's the way he wanted it,
that's the way it was gonna be.

627
01:32:51,279 --> 01:32:58,370
Even after he told me he wasn't my dad.
Then I understood.

628
01:32:58,453 --> 01:33:05,085
I realized why he always treated you
a little better. "Okay, that's it."

629
01:33:05,168 --> 01:33:12,092
"I'll hang around for leftovers."
That's how much I loved Steve.

630
01:33:12,175 --> 01:33:16,221
- Like a goddamn dog!
- Let's not talk about that now.

631
01:33:16,304 --> 01:33:22,310
- I want to! And you'll listen.
- This is a crock of shit, man.

632
01:33:22,394 --> 01:33:26,815
He set you up to conquer the world.
He didn't leave me shit.

633
01:33:26,898 --> 01:33:32,112
Nobody told you to throw your life away.
You're drunk half the time.

634
01:33:32,195 --> 01:33:37,701
- You did it to yourself.
- You act like you own the country.

635
01:33:37,784 --> 01:33:42,414
You'll always be that little asshole
who followed me around.

636
01:33:42,497 --> 01:33:48,878
Yeah, I followed you around.
I thought you were somebody. Then.

637
01:33:48,962 --> 01:33:52,007
Don't you walk out on me!

638
01:33:56,302 --> 01:33:59,264
Don't ever talk to me like this!

639
01:34:02,809 --> 01:34:08,106
You want it? I'm not Rosie, asshole.
You asked for it, man.

640
01:34:08,189 --> 01:34:11,484
I'm gonna kill you!

641
01:34:35,050 --> 01:34:38,511
He couldn't have meant it.
He's just hurt.

642
01:34:38,595 --> 01:34:42,932
Your success can't be easy for him.

643
01:34:43,016 --> 01:34:46,644
I love you.
I will always love you.

644
01:34:48,021 --> 01:34:52,233
- You sound so serious.
- I am.

645
01:34:55,820 --> 01:35:01,493
I'm still gonna marry you one of
these days. Will you wait for me?

646
01:35:01,576 --> 01:35:06,247
- For how long? Forever?
- No.

647
01:35:07,832 --> 01:35:13,672
Just till I'm 25 and have a glass cabinet
for all my gold records.

648
01:35:19,511 --> 01:35:22,681
I love you.

649
01:35:24,891 --> 01:35:30,689
I'll never let anyone get in the way
of my feelings for you ever again.

650
01:35:33,775 --> 01:35:37,195
- Come here.
- What?

651
01:35:42,617 --> 01:35:45,370
Come here.

652
01:35:54,212 --> 01:35:56,548
BUDDY HOLLY RITCHIE VALES
THE BIG BOPPER

653
01:35:56,631 --> 01:36:00,218
WINTER PARTY DANCE TOUR

654
01:36:13,231 --> 01:36:19,279
The whole heating system broke down.
The whole bus is shot.

655
01:36:19,362 --> 01:36:22,991
- To hell with it. Come home.
- You mean quit?

656
01:36:23,074 --> 01:36:26,745
<i>You're sick. I'm really sorry.</i>

657
01:36:26,828 --> 01:36:32,834
No. I'll stick it out. Just see what
you can do about the bus, okay?

658
01:36:32,917 --> 01:36:37,797
- Take care. I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay. Bye.

659
01:36:40,342 --> 01:36:45,221
Hello, baby.
How are you feeling, man?

660
01:36:45,305 --> 01:36:50,769
Listen. Holly's got a plane
to fly us on to Fargo tonight.

661
01:36:50,852 --> 01:36:55,940
Just the headliners. So get with it,
or you'll be left out in the cold.

662
01:36:56,024 --> 01:37:01,029
Are you catching my show drift?
The word is out, all right?

663
01:37:37,732 --> 01:37:41,152
- Hello?
- Bob?

664
01:37:41,236 --> 01:37:46,116
- <i>It's me, Ritchie.</i>
- What's wrong?

665
01:37:46,199 --> 01:37:50,829
- What do you mean?
- <i>You sound funny.</i>

666
01:37:50,912 --> 01:37:57,669
- I got a cold. Is Mom there?
- No, they all went to church.

667
01:37:57,752 --> 01:38:03,425
Just me and my daughter here.
I was gonna go, but you know how it is.

668
01:38:05,593 --> 01:38:10,140
Yeah. Sure wish I was there.

669
01:38:10,223 --> 01:38:13,560
<i>But you can't have your cake
and eat it, too.</i>

670
01:38:15,562 --> 01:38:21,526
Listen, Bob ... Why don't you
fly out to Chicago and meet me?

671
01:38:21,609 --> 01:38:25,613
We can finish the tour together.
I really need some family around.

672
01:38:28,491 --> 01:38:35,373
Are you sure you want me around?
After all the shit I said?

673
01:38:35,457 --> 01:38:40,545
Those were your real feelings.
We're still brothers, aren't we?

674
01:38:47,093 --> 01:38:49,637
Bob, are you still there?

675
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:57,312
Yeah, bastard, I'm still here.
And I'm still your brother.

676
01:39:00,398 --> 01:39:04,319
All right, man.
I'll see you in Chicago.

677
01:39:06,738 --> 01:39:09,616
Later, alligator.

678
01:39:19,501 --> 01:39:22,504
CLEAR LAKE
IOWA

679
01:39:26,716 --> 01:39:31,262
- Look what just rolled in.
- Hello, baby.

680
01:39:31,346 --> 01:39:35,934
It's cold! All right, Ritchie.
Here's the situation.

681
01:39:36,017 --> 01:39:40,814
I heard you didn't like to fly.
I didn't think you wanted to come.

682
01:39:40,897 --> 01:39:44,609
It's between Tommy and you now.
I'm gonna toss this coin.

683
01:39:44,693 --> 01:39:49,531
Whoever wins
is gonna ride on this plane.

684
01:39:49,614 --> 01:39:54,703
Whoever loses is gonna freeze
his ass off on the bus, all right?

685
01:39:54,786 --> 01:39:57,372
- Call her, Ritchie.
- Heads!

686
01:39:58,957 --> 01:40:02,419
- Heads it is.
- Let's fly, boy.

687
01:40:02,502 --> 01:40:07,298
- Allsup, have a good bus ride.
- Sorry, Tommy.

688
01:40:07,382 --> 01:40:12,387
- First coin toss I ever won.
- Hey, come on. Let's go!

689
01:40:13,805 --> 01:40:18,643
Whoa. Jesus.
It's like the Three Stooges.

690
01:40:20,729 --> 01:40:22,939
Is it cold?

691
01:40:26,359 --> 01:40:29,195
Yeah ...

692
01:40:31,364 --> 01:40:35,869
Hey, Ritchie.
Relax, man. Everything's cool.

693
01:40:35,952 --> 01:40:40,915
Besides, the sky belongs
to the stars, right?

694
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:23,291
<i>We interrupt
to bring you this bulletin.</i>

695
01:41:23,375 --> 01:41:27,712
<i>Four persons, three of them
famous rock 'n roll singers, -</i>

696
01:41:27,796 --> 01:41:32,884
<i>- died early today in a plane crash
five miles north of Clear Lake.</i>

697
01:41:32,967 --> 01:41:38,807
<i>Buddy Holly, 22, of Lubbock, Texas,
Ritchie Valens, 17, of California -</i>

698
01:41:38,890 --> 01:41:43,520
<i>- and J.P. Richardson, 29, of Louisiana,
known as The Big Bopper.</i>

699
01:41:43,603 --> 01:41:49,901
Bob, did you hear? Did you hear
what they said about Ritchie?

700
01:41:49,984 --> 01:41:54,572
- Are you sure he said Ritchie?
- Oh, my God.

701
01:41:54,656 --> 01:41:58,034
What about Connie ..?

702
01:41:58,118 --> 01:41:59,828
Bob!

703
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:10,714
- What is it? What's the matter?
- You better sit down, Donna.

704
01:42:13,550 --> 01:42:21,182
<i>Holly chartered the plane because
the tour bus had no heating system.</i>

705
01:42:27,522 --> 01:42:34,195
<i>The youngest victim was Ritchie Valens,
17, of Pacoima, California.</i>

706
01:42:34,279 --> 01:42:40,618
<i>He already had the hits "Donna",
"La Bamba" and "Come on, let's go."</i>

707
01:42:40,702 --> 01:42:45,457
<i>Valens was still in high school
when he was signed to Del-Fi.</i>

708
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:51,463
<i>And just a brief eight months later,
Ritchie Valens is gone.</i>

709
01:42:51,546 --> 01:42:55,633
No! Not Ritchie.

710
01:42:57,093 --> 01:42:59,971
Not my Ritchie.

711
01:43:00,055 --> 01:43:03,475
Bob, not my Ritchie!

712
01:43:03,558 --> 01:43:09,314
Not Ritchie ... not Ritchie, Bob.

713
01:43:09,397 --> 01:43:12,609
Oh, God.

714
01:43:54,234 --> 01:43:59,656
<i>And here in the San Fernando Valley
and perhaps throughout the nation -</i>

715
01:43:59,739 --> 01:44:03,910
<i>- the name of Ritchie Valens ...</i>

716
01:44:21,594 --> 01:44:25,557
Ritchie!
