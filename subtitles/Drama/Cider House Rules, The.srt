3
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,354
Hello, everyone.

4
00:00:20,094 --> 00:00:22,653
I'm Best Global's Jang Taesu,

5
00:00:22,654 --> 00:00:25,944
who recently won Businessman of the Year.

6
00:00:32,044 --> 00:00:35,903
There are many senior entrepreneurs

7
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:37,733
and colleagues who deserve the award,

8
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:39,513
so I feel a very big responsibility

9
00:00:39,514 --> 00:00:42,163
to win this accolade.

10
00:00:42,164 --> 00:00:43,343
And it's

11
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:46,833
a great honor to have the position

12
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:49,654
to represent all entrepreneurs.

13
00:00:51,304 --> 00:00:55,003
Sitting here brings back

14
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:57,774
old memories.

15
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:05,434
I had a friend.

16
00:01:06,464 --> 00:01:10,473
He trusted me when I had nothing,

17
00:01:10,474 --> 00:01:14,414
and helped me get to where I am today.

18
00:01:15,614 --> 00:01:17,843
He was the president of Taehu Industry,

19
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,744
where Best Global began.

20
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,414
Kim Sangjun.

21
00:01:28,654 --> 00:01:32,054
That was my friend's name.

22
00:01:32,974 --> 00:01:36,713
He was naively trusting

23
00:01:36,714 --> 00:01:38,813
and honest

24
00:01:38,814 --> 00:01:42,044
even to a fault.

25
00:01:43,824 --> 00:01:46,573
I considered his company

26
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:50,774
as my own,

27
00:01:51,304 --> 00:01:54,234
and worked hard.

28
00:02:01,994 --> 00:02:03,594
Mr. Jang Hyeondo.

29
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:06,434
How dare you come here!

30
00:02:08,054 --> 00:02:09,654
Jang Hyeondo?

31
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,613
You're that guy?

32
00:02:12,614 --> 00:02:14,053
How dare you show your face here?

33
00:02:14,054 --> 00:02:15,564
Get out.

34
00:02:29,174 --> 00:02:30,914
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:32,584 --> 00:02:35,344
That's all I can say.

36
00:02:49,664 --> 00:02:51,604
But

37
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:56,913
I

38
00:02:56,914 --> 00:03:00,194
Stole...

39
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:14,784
All his money.

40
00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:00,144
Hello?

41
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,714
He did?

42
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:08,644
Yes.

43
00:04:09,414 --> 00:04:14,933
I tricked my trusting friend's family,

44
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:17,894
and bought their shares for pennies.

45
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:22,953
And I even kicked his family out

46
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:26,064
from their house.

47
00:04:29,964 --> 00:04:32,663
And I used

48
00:04:32,664 --> 00:04:35,834
the stolen money

49
00:04:38,764 --> 00:04:43,064
and built my own company.

50
00:04:56,334 --> 00:04:58,873
Best Global's Jang Taesu made a confession

51
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:00,963
during the chairman's acceptance speech,

52
00:05:00,964 --> 00:05:03,673
at the Korean Businessmen's Association.

53
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:06,603
President Jang Taesu stated he embezzled

54
00:05:06,604 --> 00:05:09,093
Taehu Industry's money
on the day his friend

55
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:11,854
and president Kim Sangjun passed away...

56
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:15,354
Can you make a statement!

57
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:47,623
At the Korean Businessmen's Association's

58
00:05:47,624 --> 00:05:49,573
chairman's acceptance speech, Best Global's (KBC NEWS, Breaking
News, Best Global's Jang Taesu confesses to embezzlement)

59
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:52,373
Jang Taesu made a surprise announcement.

60
00:05:52,374 --> 00:05:53,863
President Jang Taesu...

61
00:05:53,864 --> 00:05:56,903
During his speech, he confessed to

62
00:05:56,904 --> 00:05:59,403
embezzlement on the day his friend and

63
00:05:59,404 --> 00:06:02,883
former president Kim Sangjun passed away.

64
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:06,793
The president of Best Global, Jang Taesu,

65
00:06:06,794 --> 00:06:09,153
formerly known as Taehu Industry,

66
00:06:09,154 --> 00:06:11,733
won Businessman of the
Year Award last January.

67
00:06:11,734 --> 00:06:13,243
Controversy over the selection

68
00:06:13,244 --> 00:06:16,633
process seems inevitable.

69
00:06:16,634 --> 00:06:19,613
Reporting from the KBA inauguration,

70
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:22,344
this is Kim Taehyeon of KBS.

71
00:07:32,904 --> 00:07:35,464
(Best Global's Jang Taesu
Confesses to Embezzlement)

72
00:07:47,064 --> 00:07:49,274
What are you staring at?

73
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:51,533
Oh, my!

74
00:07:51,534 --> 00:07:53,383
Look who it is!

75
00:07:53,384 --> 00:07:56,823
The president of Jiwan's
company and his son!

76
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:58,103
Right?

77
00:07:58,104 --> 00:08:00,163
Yes, you're right.

78
00:08:00,164 --> 00:08:03,183
Oh, my, what happened?

79
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:06,254
This is why you need to date with caution.

80
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:10,903
Wait, they broke up.

81
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:12,894
Oh, still, Jiwan...

82
00:08:15,264 --> 00:08:16,664
It's over.

83
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,624
But aren't you relieved?

84
00:08:23,054 --> 00:08:25,053
Maybe Eunsu had a hunch.

85
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:27,513
Maybe that's why they broke up.

86
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:28,904
Minja...

87
00:08:32,164 --> 00:08:35,814
Right, I'm needed at the big room.

88
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:44,004
(Jang Taesu)

89
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,434
Have you been well?

90
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:10,814
(The late Kim Sangjun's Grave)

91
00:09:12,404 --> 00:09:15,654
I'm sorry I haven't visited much.

92
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,714
Perhaps

93
00:10:04,894 --> 00:10:09,504
Sangjun died because of me.

94
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:17,103
That day

95
00:10:17,104 --> 00:10:20,424
I was supposed to meet Sangjun,

96
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:24,453
and I was late.

97
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:28,094
Sugyeong, why are you doing this?

98
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:31,053
Stay there. I'll be there by five!

99
00:10:31,054 --> 00:10:32,194
Okay?

100
00:10:36,974 --> 00:10:39,664
Everyone had gone home,

101
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:44,203
and when I got back to the office,

102
00:10:44,204 --> 00:10:49,603
I saw a pill bottle on the hallway.

103
00:10:49,604 --> 00:10:52,034
This is Sangjun's medicine.

104
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:55,014
Why is this...

105
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,163
Sangjun.

106
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:08,743
Sangjun!

107
00:11:08,744 --> 00:11:10,724
Hey, Sangjun!

108
00:12:02,684 --> 00:12:05,473
After that day,

109
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,903
I knew I would regret it

110
00:12:08,904 --> 00:12:10,794
for the rest of my life.

111
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:16,253
Why didn't you stop then?

112
00:12:16,254 --> 00:12:22,034
My mother and I would've forgiven you.

113
00:12:22,924 --> 00:12:26,013
Jiwan and my mother

114
00:12:26,014 --> 00:12:29,013
would've considered you

115
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:32,284
as a father and a son,

116
00:12:33,394 --> 00:12:36,094
and we could've been a family.

117
00:12:56,614 --> 00:12:58,164
Dad!

118
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:37,003
It was all because of my greed.

119
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:42,494
I tried to convince myself I did it for

120
00:13:43,224 --> 00:13:47,634
Sugyeong and Hyeondo, but it was my greed.

121
00:13:52,104 --> 00:13:54,394
I'm sorry, Seonhui.

122
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:01,844
If it were Sangjun,

123
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:07,804
he would've forgiven you already.

124
00:14:13,294 --> 00:14:16,773
You should

125
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:22,704
free yourself from that guilt.

126
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:32,164
I'm sorry.

127
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,364
Once again, I'm sorry, Seonhui.

128
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:27,393
How have you been?

129
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,983
Lots of things have been bothering me,

130
00:15:29,984 --> 00:15:31,443
but I've been alright.

131
00:15:31,444 --> 00:15:33,044
Why? Are you worried?

132
00:15:34,014 --> 00:15:35,454
Yes.

133
00:15:36,714 --> 00:15:38,274
I am worried.

134
00:15:39,494 --> 00:15:42,784
You have to be firm to run a company.

135
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,383
You said you wanted to be like me.

136
00:15:46,384 --> 00:15:48,403
A businessman like me.

137
00:15:48,404 --> 00:15:50,864
Although I'm sure you've changed your mind.

138
00:15:52,924 --> 00:15:55,133
You're soft, just like Sangjun,

139
00:15:55,134 --> 00:15:58,594
but you can be firm, so you'll do well.

140
00:15:59,444 --> 00:16:00,893
Sangjun gave me that company,

141
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:04,424
so giving it to you is
the right thing to do.

142
00:16:06,554 --> 00:16:08,284
You developed the company.

143
00:16:09,724 --> 00:16:12,013
I believe the only person who can

144
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,183
run it well, is you.

145
00:16:14,184 --> 00:16:16,043
If I stay at the company,

146
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:17,843
it will suffer.

147
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,614
So I must resign.

148
00:16:23,904 --> 00:16:27,764
Discuss with your elders
at home and decide.

149
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,483
He's giving you what?

150
00:16:34,484 --> 00:16:35,953
Stocks.

151
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,803
And he's resigning from his position.

152
00:16:38,804 --> 00:16:41,443
So the stocks,

153
00:16:41,444 --> 00:16:43,954
how much are they worth?

154
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:48,023
We didn't do this for the money, Haengsuk.

155
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:51,914
But if we can get it, why not?

156
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:56,153
Seonhui,

157
00:16:56,154 --> 00:16:57,463
let's accept it, okay?

158
00:16:57,464 --> 00:16:58,434
Just accept it.

159
00:16:58,435 --> 00:16:59,783
We can buy a house.

160
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:02,183
The landlord will ask for extra deposit,

161
00:17:02,184 --> 00:17:04,783
and I'm tired of moving.

162
00:17:04,784 --> 00:17:08,404
Jiwan and Eunsu need money to get married.

163
00:17:09,214 --> 00:17:10,934
I don't need anything.

164
00:17:11,684 --> 00:17:13,783
I can take care of myself.

165
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:15,863
I can't believe you!

166
00:17:15,864 --> 00:17:17,483
We need money for so many things!

167
00:17:17,484 --> 00:17:20,203
You don't know how important money is!

168
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:22,643
We can't just accept it, Haengsuk.

169
00:17:22,644 --> 00:17:24,474
Why not?

170
00:17:25,774 --> 00:17:27,373
Mom.

171
00:17:27,374 --> 00:17:30,744
Your opinion is more important than hers.

172
00:17:31,404 --> 00:17:35,563
Seonhui,

173
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:38,534
you and Jiwan decide.

174
00:17:39,654 --> 00:17:43,854
Why? When you're the elder of the family?

175
00:18:09,094 --> 00:18:11,904
I wasn't expecting your call.

176
00:18:13,024 --> 00:18:14,163
Jiwan told me

177
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:16,784
what you plan on doing.

178
00:18:18,004 --> 00:18:20,693
I kept putting it off,

179
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:23,194
but I couldn't put it off any longer.

180
00:18:24,134 --> 00:18:25,173
Right.

181
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:28,954
I was wondering why I
haven't heard from you.

182
00:18:31,064 --> 00:18:33,413
If you're hesitating,

183
00:18:33,414 --> 00:18:35,143
there's no need for it.

184
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:38,993
I'm not saying I'm handing
it over to Jiwan now...

185
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:41,754
I'm sorry for cutting you off.

186
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:47,123
No matter how much I think about it,

187
00:18:47,124 --> 00:18:51,153
my family can't accept that money from you.

188
00:18:51,154 --> 00:18:52,383
But Seonhui...

189
00:18:52,384 --> 00:18:55,734
Sangjun gave you that company.

190
00:18:56,764 --> 00:19:02,824
He did it because he believed in you.

191
00:19:04,514 --> 00:19:09,443
Do you believe in Jiwan

192
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:11,524
as much as Sangjun believed in you?

193
00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:15,853
He has the qualities of a good businessman.

194
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,293
You're saying he has the potential,

195
00:19:18,294 --> 00:19:21,223
but you don't believe in him as much.

196
00:19:21,224 --> 00:19:23,833
But I want to give him a chance.

197
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:28,003
I know you feel you owe my family

198
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:29,594
a lot.

199
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:32,433
But I don't want to take away

200
00:19:32,434 --> 00:19:38,194
Jiwan's chance of making it on his own.

201
00:19:43,494 --> 00:19:48,863
The moment Sangjun decided to give you

202
00:19:48,864 --> 00:19:51,484
the company, it became yours.

203
00:19:52,354 --> 00:19:53,783
I'm sure it was the best decision

204
00:19:53,784 --> 00:19:57,144
he could've made for us and the company.

205
00:19:58,384 --> 00:20:01,433
So now,

206
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,814
the decision is yours.

207
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:11,323
You're the one who love and cherish

208
00:20:11,324 --> 00:20:13,124
Best Global the most.

209
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:44,474
Were you disappointed?

210
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:47,244
No.

211
00:20:49,334 --> 00:20:50,894
Okay, Hanseok.

212
00:20:52,504 --> 00:20:54,624
There is

213
00:20:55,924 --> 00:20:58,194
one last thing you can help me with.

214
00:21:08,284 --> 00:21:13,243
Since establishing this company in '93,

215
00:21:13,244 --> 00:21:17,033
I was confident I worked
harder than anyone.

216
00:21:17,034 --> 00:21:20,563
But now that I look back,

217
00:21:20,564 --> 00:21:23,863
I wasn't the only one
who built this company.

218
00:21:23,864 --> 00:21:26,153
I believe it was built by

219
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:30,783
everyone sitting here, and the love our

220
00:21:30,784 --> 00:21:33,194
customers have shown Best Global.

221
00:21:34,114 --> 00:21:38,763
So I am going to resign from my position,

222
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:43,844
and donate my shares to society.

223
00:21:45,784 --> 00:21:52,373
I believe that is the only compensation

224
00:21:52,374 --> 00:21:56,514
I can offer the people I hurt.

225
00:21:59,064 --> 00:22:02,073
I appreciate all your hard work.

226
00:22:02,074 --> 00:22:03,794
Thank you.

227
00:23:12,594 --> 00:23:15,184
(Best Global's Jang Taesu
Donates His Fortune)

228
00:23:19,994 --> 00:23:23,384
He could've bought me a few houses first.

229
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:30,783
Seonhui, what did you say?

230
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,704
Wait,

231
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:33,183
what are you doing with that money?

232
00:23:33,184 --> 00:23:34,543
Oh, my!

233
00:23:34,544 --> 00:23:36,433
Has poverty driven you mad?

234
00:23:36,434 --> 00:23:38,773
Seonhui, why don't you

235
00:23:38,774 --> 00:23:40,223
give it to me?

236
00:23:40,224 --> 00:23:42,813
I can spend that money

237
00:23:42,814 --> 00:23:45,563
in a really good way.

238
00:23:45,564 --> 00:23:47,243
- So...
- Minja, you're funny.

239
00:23:47,244 --> 00:23:48,433
Wait!

240
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:49,384
I mean...

241
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:51,073
Seonhui!

242
00:23:51,074 --> 00:23:52,294
You know me, don't you?

243
00:23:54,604 --> 00:23:56,603
The watermelon is really sweet.

244
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:58,243
That's so much money.

245
00:23:58,244 --> 00:24:00,413
How could they give it all up?

246
00:24:00,414 --> 00:24:03,663
How can people have no desire for money?

247
00:24:03,664 --> 00:24:05,243
Do they like living like this? Like this?

248
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:07,123
Oh, be quiet.

249
00:24:07,124 --> 00:24:09,773
They say they want to make it on their own,

250
00:24:09,774 --> 00:24:11,063
so what can I do?

251
00:24:11,064 --> 00:24:13,423
I've seen people who suddenly become rich,

252
00:24:13,424 --> 00:24:17,633
and bad things happen to them.

253
00:24:17,634 --> 00:24:19,543
I'm scared of money now.

254
00:24:19,544 --> 00:24:21,223
Bad things, yeah right!

255
00:24:21,224 --> 00:24:23,113
You never had that kind of money before.

256
00:24:23,114 --> 00:24:25,563
- What?
- If they gave me a bit of it,

257
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,174
I could have a decent...

258
00:24:29,364 --> 00:24:31,013
Decent what?

259
00:24:31,014 --> 00:24:32,923
You need money?

260
00:24:32,924 --> 00:24:34,173
Of course I do!

261
00:24:34,174 --> 00:24:36,073
I have lots of things I want to buy!

262
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,253
I don't have any clothes to wear!

263
00:24:38,254 --> 00:24:41,603
Oh, when will you ever grow up?

264
00:24:41,604 --> 00:24:44,984
I'm sick of stealing Eunsu's clothes.

265
00:24:46,994 --> 00:24:48,594
I'm never going to grow up!

266
00:24:56,164 --> 00:24:58,564
Do you have any plans?

267
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:01,164
I'm just going to take time off.

268
00:25:02,914 --> 00:25:04,593
Okay.

269
00:25:04,594 --> 00:25:06,014
You should do that.

270
00:25:07,484 --> 00:25:08,994
What about you?

271
00:25:09,714 --> 00:25:11,523
You told me to learn to
become a businessman.

272
00:25:11,524 --> 00:25:12,994
I should do that now.

273
00:25:15,094 --> 00:25:18,613
You established Best Global.

274
00:25:18,614 --> 00:25:21,483
The records and journals in your study,

275
00:25:21,484 --> 00:25:23,463
if I take from that,

276
00:25:23,464 --> 00:25:25,403
I'd become the most valuable employee.

277
00:25:25,404 --> 00:25:27,123
I'll start training for real.

278
00:25:27,124 --> 00:25:29,173
I'm going to start from the bottom,

279
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:31,704
and become the head executive director.

280
00:25:50,914 --> 00:25:54,354
(Ms. Jeong Sugyeong)

281
00:25:58,994 --> 00:26:00,733
Oh, boy.

282
00:26:00,734 --> 00:26:02,413
My son finally grew up,

283
00:26:02,414 --> 00:26:04,624
but I have no one to brag to.

284
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:22,974
You come here too often these days.

285
00:26:23,954 --> 00:26:27,384
I came before I get too busy to visit.

286
00:26:28,324 --> 00:26:30,163
Do you like it here?

287
00:26:30,164 --> 00:26:32,224
Of course I do.

288
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:35,493
Are you here to spy on me?

289
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:38,084
Are you going to let Father be?

290
00:26:38,634 --> 00:26:40,883
We're divorced, so we're strangers.

291
00:26:40,884 --> 00:26:42,453
You don't want to get back together?

292
00:26:42,454 --> 00:26:43,783
No.

293
00:26:43,784 --> 00:26:47,283
I love being legally single and free!

294
00:26:47,284 --> 00:26:48,513
What are you going to do?

295
00:26:48,514 --> 00:26:49,923
What do you mean?

296
00:26:49,924 --> 00:26:53,273
We'll live this way, seeing other people.

297
00:26:53,274 --> 00:26:54,924
Have you met someone?

298
00:26:56,474 --> 00:26:58,743
I am going to.

299
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:01,083
Do you want me to live alone forever?

300
00:27:01,084 --> 00:27:04,774
I mean, I think Father's waiting for you.

301
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:08,694
But it's up to you two.

302
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,393
Who is it?

303
00:27:34,394 --> 00:27:35,483
Oh, Ms. Lee!

304
00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:36,863
Welcome.

305
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:37,984
Oh.

306
00:27:38,814 --> 00:27:39,714
Have you been well?

307
00:27:39,715 --> 00:27:41,683
Yes. What brings you here?

308
00:27:41,684 --> 00:27:43,004
Have a seat over there.

309
00:27:47,694 --> 00:27:49,283
Here.

310
00:27:49,284 --> 00:27:50,743
What's all this?

311
00:27:50,744 --> 00:27:53,683
I heard your husband likes this herb.

312
00:27:53,684 --> 00:27:55,573
I had some at home, so I brought it over.

313
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:57,693
Oh, you brought so much.

314
00:27:57,694 --> 00:28:00,734
Thank you very much.

315
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:05,164
Did you have something to tell me?

316
00:28:08,724 --> 00:28:14,583
Minja, let's not beat around the bush,

317
00:28:14,584 --> 00:28:17,614
and be honest with each other.

318
00:28:18,144 --> 00:28:19,473
What about?

319
00:28:19,474 --> 00:28:24,824
Is there something to be honest about?

320
00:28:26,474 --> 00:28:27,804
Hi, Mom.

321
00:28:28,724 --> 00:28:31,104
I'm on my way home from school.

322
00:28:31,864 --> 00:28:33,744
You want to see me now?

323
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:35,933
Okay.

324
00:28:35,934 --> 00:28:37,374
Hi, Grandma.

325
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:41,624
But I can't get off work until later.

326
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,363
I'll be there right after work, then.

327
00:28:45,364 --> 00:28:46,514
Bye.

328
00:28:49,484 --> 00:28:51,044
You said you wanted to see a movie.

329
00:28:51,894 --> 00:28:53,743
Why all of a sudden?

330
00:28:53,744 --> 00:28:56,373
You're not feeling well?

331
00:28:56,374 --> 00:28:57,874
But why...

332
00:28:59,354 --> 00:29:01,004
Okay, Grandma.

333
00:29:02,854 --> 00:29:05,494
Okay. I'll call you later.

334
00:29:06,514 --> 00:29:08,893
That's too bad.

335
00:29:08,894 --> 00:29:10,674
I'll see you at home.

336
00:29:12,094 --> 00:29:13,964
But why so suddenly...

337
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:21,033
My grandmother is sick, so she can't come.

338
00:29:21,034 --> 00:29:24,604
My mom has to see someone.

339
00:29:27,804 --> 00:29:30,794
What should I do with the movie tickets?

340
00:29:35,604 --> 00:29:37,064
What time is the movie?

341
00:29:38,584 --> 00:29:40,754
There's an hour left.

342
00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:45,033
Then cancel them.

343
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,594
One hour is plenty of time.

344
00:29:50,394 --> 00:29:51,894
Jiwan!

345
00:30:03,124 --> 00:30:04,273
See?

346
00:30:04,274 --> 00:30:06,543
We have to get involved.

347
00:30:06,544 --> 00:30:08,193
They are young, so if we give them

348
00:30:08,194 --> 00:30:10,704
a nudge, I'm sure they'll get it.

349
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,883
Hey!

350
00:30:14,884 --> 00:30:18,443
You...

351
00:30:18,444 --> 00:30:21,644
Why aren't you on a date?

352
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:28,154
Why did you come here?

353
00:30:29,084 --> 00:30:30,733
You said you were sick,

354
00:30:30,734 --> 00:30:32,454
so I came here to get some porridge.

355
00:30:32,954 --> 00:30:34,193
Grandma,

356
00:30:34,194 --> 00:30:36,273
don't you have to see a doctor?

357
00:30:36,274 --> 00:30:38,254
Let's go. I'll take you.

358
00:30:38,794 --> 00:30:40,053
Oh, silly boy!

359
00:30:40,054 --> 00:30:43,823
Taking me to a doctor isn't what I want!

360
00:30:43,824 --> 00:30:45,234
Where's Yeongju?

361
00:30:47,034 --> 00:30:48,834
So?

362
00:30:49,984 --> 00:30:52,463
What do you mean, so?

363
00:30:52,464 --> 00:30:54,973
We had shaved ice and said goodbye.

364
00:30:54,974 --> 00:30:57,253
I have so much work to do,

365
00:30:57,254 --> 00:30:59,693
so stop playing jokes on me.

366
00:30:59,694 --> 00:31:01,093
Jokes?

367
00:31:01,094 --> 00:31:02,673
You think I'm doing this

368
00:31:02,674 --> 00:31:04,183
because I have nothing better to do?

369
00:31:04,184 --> 00:31:06,183
I can't understand you at all.

370
00:31:06,184 --> 00:31:09,513
We provided you with the perfect chance,

371
00:31:09,514 --> 00:31:12,994
so you should see a movie, have dinner...

372
00:31:13,904 --> 00:31:15,743
What does he take my daughter for?

373
00:31:15,744 --> 00:31:16,833
What's his problem?

374
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,403
You're such a pretty girl!

375
00:31:18,404 --> 00:31:21,223
What more does he want?

376
00:31:21,224 --> 00:31:23,403
He doesn't want anything.

377
00:31:23,404 --> 00:31:26,873
So please stay out of my business.

378
00:31:26,874 --> 00:31:29,063
At this rate, you'll die single!

379
00:31:29,064 --> 00:31:31,353
I'm really scared for you!

380
00:31:31,354 --> 00:31:33,523
I would love to find out

381
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,393
what you're thinking.

382
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,754
It's not like that so stop!

383
00:31:40,864 --> 00:31:44,063
Why are they so dense?

384
00:31:44,064 --> 00:31:44,964
They should at least go on a few dates,

385
00:31:44,965 --> 00:31:48,243
when I am helping them out.

386
00:31:48,244 --> 00:31:49,383
You should give up.

387
00:31:49,384 --> 00:31:51,553
Maybe they aren't meant to be together.

388
00:31:51,554 --> 00:31:53,953
Oh, I think I've tried just about,

389
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:56,513
no, I've tried everything I could

390
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:58,493
possibly try, given the circumstances.

391
00:31:58,494 --> 00:32:02,953
I thought Jiwan was the dense one,

392
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,793
but I think it's Yeongju is the problem.

393
00:32:05,794 --> 00:32:07,083
What?

394
00:32:07,084 --> 00:32:09,194
What's wrong with Yeongju?

395
00:32:09,724 --> 00:32:12,303
She knows how Jiwan is,

396
00:32:12,304 --> 00:32:15,693
so she should take charge, and...

397
00:32:15,694 --> 00:32:17,493
Oh, my!

398
00:32:17,494 --> 00:32:19,683
That's nonsense, Ms. Lee!

399
00:32:19,684 --> 00:32:22,163
Yeongju is a teacher!

400
00:32:22,164 --> 00:32:25,073
She's a lady, so she can't do that.

401
00:32:25,074 --> 00:32:27,434
What if a rumor starts?

402
00:32:27,984 --> 00:32:29,583
Well,

403
00:32:29,584 --> 00:32:31,193
to be honest,

404
00:32:31,194 --> 00:32:33,183
Jiwan is the problem.

405
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,133
He's a man, but he's not bold.

406
00:32:35,134 --> 00:32:36,753
He lacks passion and drive.

407
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,923
He's so lukewarm and bland.

408
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:40,303
What?

409
00:32:40,304 --> 00:32:41,573
Lukewarm and bland?

410
00:32:41,574 --> 00:32:44,824
That's because he's cautious.

411
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:47,033
If he's anymore cautious,

412
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:49,073
he'll be single forever.

413
00:32:49,074 --> 00:32:50,223
Wait,

414
00:32:50,224 --> 00:32:53,594
are you cursing my grandson?

415
00:32:54,604 --> 00:32:57,213
You started it.

416
00:32:57,214 --> 00:32:58,764
Oh, boy.

417
00:33:01,394 --> 00:33:03,733
Why is this coffee so bland?

418
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,414
You said it!

419
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:11,423
Yes.

420
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,653
I'm grateful for your offer,

421
00:33:12,654 --> 00:33:17,293
but I don't want an honorary position.

422
00:33:17,294 --> 00:33:23,093
Yes, tell them I said thanks, but no.

423
00:33:23,094 --> 00:33:25,614
Yes. Thank you anyway. Goodbye.

424
00:33:46,164 --> 00:33:49,484
Ma'am, get me a glass of water!

425
00:33:51,824 --> 00:33:54,693
- With ice, hurry up.
- Ms. Jeong...

426
00:33:54,694 --> 00:33:57,074
You're always so slow!

427
00:34:00,364 --> 00:34:01,793
Wait,

428
00:34:01,794 --> 00:34:04,283
what are you doing in my house?

429
00:34:04,284 --> 00:34:06,713
I was in Seoul, so I dropped by.

430
00:34:06,714 --> 00:34:10,383
But you have no business here.

431
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:15,423
So this house is all you have now?

432
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,703
Yes.

433
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,204
I've no business with a poor man.

434
00:34:19,804 --> 00:34:21,143
Good.

435
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:23,003
You have no business with me,

436
00:34:23,004 --> 00:34:24,983
and you divorced me.

437
00:34:24,984 --> 00:34:28,514
No money, and legally a stranger.

438
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:31,773
You can't hold on to me anymore.

439
00:34:31,774 --> 00:34:34,584
I have no intention of holding on to you.

440
00:34:35,504 --> 00:34:37,913
But I still came to see you,

441
00:34:37,914 --> 00:34:39,944
I guess you're still attractive.

442
00:34:42,454 --> 00:34:43,593
Ma'am!

443
00:34:43,594 --> 00:34:46,224
I asked for ice water ages ago!

444
00:34:56,704 --> 00:34:57,873
I'm going to get some rest,

445
00:34:57,874 --> 00:34:59,444
so don't make any noise.

446
00:35:05,524 --> 00:35:07,164
What's this?

447
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:11,903
Jeong Sugyeong!

448
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:12,794
We're divorced,

449
00:35:12,795 --> 00:35:15,923
so why is the credit card under my name!

450
00:35:15,924 --> 00:35:17,163
Be quiet!

451
00:35:17,164 --> 00:35:19,053
Don't be petty. It's not a lot.

452
00:35:19,054 --> 00:35:20,954
I told you I'm taking a nap.

453
00:35:22,814 --> 00:35:24,894
What is she trying to do?

454
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,623
How much is this?

455
00:35:27,624 --> 00:35:30,264
Hundred, thousand,...

456
00:35:31,174 --> 00:35:34,684
You went on a shopping spree?

457
00:35:37,334 --> 00:35:39,483
Hi, it's me.

458
00:35:39,484 --> 00:35:40,294
Yes.

459
00:35:40,295 --> 00:35:45,293
The advisor position you talked about?

460
00:35:45,294 --> 00:35:46,973
I thought about it,

461
00:35:46,974 --> 00:35:49,993
and I do kind of want to take it.

462
00:35:49,994 --> 00:35:52,634
How much is the annual salary?

463
00:35:54,284 --> 00:35:56,023
Yes, that sounds good.

464
00:35:56,024 --> 00:35:58,023
That's a pretty good offer.

465
00:35:58,024 --> 00:35:59,584
When should I start?

466
00:38:14,134 --> 00:38:15,944
(1 year later)

467
00:38:18,264 --> 00:38:19,974
Sign there.

468
00:38:24,894 --> 00:38:26,044
Thank you.

469
00:38:29,284 --> 00:38:30,824
Thank you very much.

470
00:38:39,574 --> 00:38:40,894
(Yeongju)

471
00:38:41,384 --> 00:38:43,144
Hi, Yeongju.

472
00:38:43,664 --> 00:38:46,143
Of course I got the contract.

473
00:38:46,144 --> 00:38:48,873
Tell Mr. Kang not to worry.

474
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:51,254
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

475
00:39:04,504 --> 00:39:06,964
(To Kang Yeongju)

476
00:39:10,004 --> 00:39:11,804
It's been a year already.

477
00:39:34,194 --> 00:39:36,764
Jiwan must have gotten his, too.

478
00:40:04,574 --> 00:40:06,154
Yeongju,

479
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:12,064
you'll read this a year from now,

480
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:21,554
and I want to say I'm waiting for Jiwan.

481
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:24,114
I'm going to

482
00:40:25,534 --> 00:40:27,574
tell Jiwan how I feel about him.

483
00:40:29,714 --> 00:40:30,964
Yeongju.

484
00:40:34,314 --> 00:40:35,874
You're writing?

485
00:40:36,324 --> 00:40:38,424
You came to get coffee?

486
00:41:02,284 --> 00:41:05,594
My days of being his friend's sister,

487
00:41:06,314 --> 00:41:08,174
perhaps...

488
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:13,064
Perhaps this will be the last time.

489
00:41:14,134 --> 00:41:16,954
If he turns me down after I tell him,

490
00:41:17,634 --> 00:41:19,883
your heart...

491
00:41:19,884 --> 00:41:22,793
The year you will spend waiting

492
00:41:22,794 --> 00:41:25,634
might make Jiwan feel uncomfortable,

493
00:41:29,184 --> 00:41:31,984
so you might try to avoid him.

494
00:42:32,674 --> 00:42:33,834
Yeongju.

495
00:42:34,784 --> 00:42:36,443
You got off work?

496
00:42:36,444 --> 00:42:38,303
Yes.

497
00:42:38,304 --> 00:42:40,854
Good. Go home and get some rest.

498
00:42:41,944 --> 00:42:43,754
But Yeongju,

499
00:42:44,724 --> 00:42:47,684
be brave and tell him.

500
00:42:48,684 --> 00:42:50,633
How desperate...

501
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:52,123
Jiwan!

502
00:42:52,124 --> 00:42:54,124
You feel.

503
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:41,264
Enjoy your food.

504
00:43:42,894 --> 00:43:44,463
- All of it is good.
- You like it?

505
00:43:44,464 --> 00:43:46,053
It's so delicious.

506
00:43:46,054 --> 00:43:49,183
Being the owner suits you better!

507
00:43:49,184 --> 00:43:52,583
You look better now than in your uniform.

508
00:43:52,584 --> 00:43:53,663
You look so much better.

509
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:55,043
Thank you.

510
00:43:55,044 --> 00:43:56,624
Enjoy your food.

511
00:43:58,924 --> 00:44:01,083
Oh, you're here! Eunsu, you're here, too?

512
00:44:01,084 --> 00:44:03,094
Hello. Congratulations.

513
00:44:04,794 --> 00:44:06,473
I heard the headquarters has high hopes

514
00:44:06,474 --> 00:44:08,143
for this branch, and I can see why.

515
00:44:08,144 --> 00:44:10,963
What high hopes?

516
00:44:10,964 --> 00:44:13,763
But isn't this smaller than my branch?

517
00:44:13,764 --> 00:44:15,083
What? You should go in there.

518
00:44:15,084 --> 00:44:16,934
It's much bigger.

519
00:44:17,934 --> 00:44:19,793
All you need to do now is make money.

520
00:44:19,794 --> 00:44:20,774
Right.

521
00:44:20,775 --> 00:44:23,223
But where is your mother?

522
00:44:23,224 --> 00:44:24,403
- She'll be here soon.
- Okay.

523
00:44:24,404 --> 00:44:26,463
You should get something good.

524
00:44:26,464 --> 00:44:27,264
Honey.

525
00:44:27,265 --> 00:44:28,893
No, no need to escort us.

526
00:44:28,894 --> 00:44:31,734
Go inside and have a seat.

527
00:44:34,944 --> 00:44:37,164
Oh, Ms. Lee!

528
00:44:37,614 --> 00:44:39,973
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

529
00:44:39,974 --> 00:44:43,963
Jiwan didn't send you a plant?

530
00:44:43,964 --> 00:44:47,833
He must be very busy with the wedding.

531
00:44:47,834 --> 00:44:49,243
Where's Yeongju?

532
00:44:49,244 --> 00:44:50,543
She'll be here soon.

533
00:44:50,544 --> 00:44:52,233
She went to deliver rice cake upstairs

534
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:54,034
and the parking lot, but
she hasn't returned.

535
00:44:54,864 --> 00:44:57,143
You're getting more and more beautiful.

536
00:44:57,144 --> 00:44:58,633
Thank you.

537
00:44:58,634 --> 00:45:00,243
You should get something to eat.

538
00:45:00,244 --> 00:45:01,983
Yes, please let us have some.

539
00:45:01,984 --> 00:45:03,633
Sure.

540
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:05,883
Honey, can you take care of them?

541
00:45:05,884 --> 00:45:07,684
Okay.

542
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:12,873
No, it's okay.

543
00:45:12,874 --> 00:45:14,963
If there's work, I should
go, even on a weekend.

544
00:45:14,964 --> 00:45:17,603
It'll take me a little over an hour.

545
00:45:17,604 --> 00:45:19,853
Honey!

546
00:45:19,854 --> 00:45:20,854
Yes?

547
00:45:20,855 --> 00:45:22,793
What about my meal?

548
00:45:22,794 --> 00:45:25,923
I made side dishes. They're in the fridge.

549
00:45:25,924 --> 00:45:28,333
You can just take them out and eat.

550
00:45:28,334 --> 00:45:30,813
I can't eat alone.

551
00:45:30,814 --> 00:45:33,093
You won't even let me hire a housekeeper.

552
00:45:33,094 --> 00:45:35,103
Just today. It's only for today.

553
00:45:35,104 --> 00:45:37,453
I'm busy. I'll see you later.

554
00:45:37,454 --> 00:45:38,623
I told you to apologize,

555
00:45:38,624 --> 00:45:40,993
not donate your entire fortune!

556
00:45:40,994 --> 00:45:43,133
You even sold the house!

557
00:45:43,134 --> 00:45:44,553
I'll be back.

558
00:45:44,554 --> 00:45:46,593
Wait, honey!

559
00:45:46,594 --> 00:45:48,343
Keep next weekend open.

560
00:45:48,344 --> 00:45:49,904
We have to be somewhere.

561
00:45:51,414 --> 00:45:52,404
Okay.

562
00:45:52,405 --> 00:45:53,624
I'll see you later.

563
00:45:55,974 --> 00:45:57,324
Have a nice day.

564
00:46:03,704 --> 00:46:06,463
Oh, what's taking her so long?

565
00:46:06,464 --> 00:46:07,973
Seonhui!

566
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,583
Yes, mother. I'm coming.

567
00:46:09,584 --> 00:46:10,893
What took you so long?

568
00:46:10,894 --> 00:46:12,013
Where's Eunsu?

569
00:46:12,014 --> 00:46:13,933
She's already there.

570
00:46:13,934 --> 00:46:15,423
- She is?
- Yes.

571
00:46:15,424 --> 00:46:17,813
- Let's go.
- You look beautiful.

572
00:46:17,814 --> 00:46:19,874
- I do?
- Of course.

573
00:46:35,004 --> 00:46:37,283
Is someone getting married today?

574
00:46:37,284 --> 00:46:38,673
Yes.

575
00:46:38,674 --> 00:46:40,023
Hyeondo, you come up, too.

576
00:46:40,024 --> 00:46:40,954
You have to say hi.

577
00:46:40,955 --> 00:46:42,283
Me?

578
00:46:42,284 --> 00:46:44,143
But it's hard to get a parking spot here!

579
00:46:44,144 --> 00:46:47,153
Go park and come up. It's the 3rd floor.

580
00:46:47,154 --> 00:46:48,264
Hurry up.

581
00:46:56,884 --> 00:46:59,554
Oh, you're here. Thank you.

582
00:47:01,604 --> 00:47:03,893
Are you not going to see them ever again?

583
00:47:03,894 --> 00:47:05,914
You have to see them, sooner or later.

584
00:47:06,484 --> 00:47:07,993
- Let's go.
- Honey.

585
00:47:07,994 --> 00:47:09,354
Taesu!

586
00:47:17,644 --> 00:47:18,634
Oh...

587
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:20,644
Welcome.

588
00:47:21,644 --> 00:47:22,973
You made it all the way here, so stay.

589
00:47:22,974 --> 00:47:25,194
You can't just leave.

590
00:47:26,414 --> 00:47:28,593
How much longer do you think I have?

591
00:47:28,594 --> 00:47:31,683
Don't cry at my grave after I'm gone,

592
00:47:31,684 --> 00:47:34,253
and show me your face from time to time.

593
00:47:34,254 --> 00:47:36,144
That's how you can be a good son.

594
00:47:39,044 --> 00:47:40,463
We don't have a lot of guests,

595
00:47:40,464 --> 00:47:42,363
so go in and have a seat.

596
00:47:42,364 --> 00:47:43,604
Let's go.

597
00:47:48,934 --> 00:47:50,143
I'm glad you came.

598
00:47:50,144 --> 00:47:53,814
Had I left him be, he'd never come see you.

599
00:47:54,314 --> 00:47:58,094
You don't even know whose wedding this is?

600
00:48:32,204 --> 00:48:33,474
Eunsu...

601
00:48:58,904 --> 00:49:00,514
I'm Han Eunsu.

602
00:49:05,454 --> 00:49:08,803
You're my brother's friend,

603
00:49:08,804 --> 00:49:10,864
Jang Hyeondo, right?

604
00:49:13,204 --> 00:49:15,884
Kim Jiwan, you're dating now?

605
00:49:16,794 --> 00:49:17,794
I'm Jang Hyeondo.

606
00:49:18,214 --> 00:49:20,204
Hello, I'm Han Eunsu.

607
00:49:21,304 --> 00:49:24,353
For a picky guy, you sure have

608
00:49:24,354 --> 00:49:26,064
average taste in women.

609
00:49:29,464 --> 00:49:31,644
I'm sorry for being average.

610
00:49:37,734 --> 00:49:39,254
Right.

611
00:49:40,134 --> 00:49:41,584
Kim Jiwan's friend.

612
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,173
Hello.

613
00:50:09,174 --> 00:50:13,214
Excuse me, can I see the bride's face?

614
00:50:15,194 --> 00:50:18,993
I never thought I could be so happy!

615
00:50:18,994 --> 00:50:22,123
Where's my most handsome husband?

616
00:50:22,124 --> 00:50:23,373
I want to see him!

617
00:50:23,374 --> 00:50:25,334
Darling!

618
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:50,384
Darling!

619
00:50:51,934 --> 00:50:53,494
Oh, darling.

620
00:50:55,454 --> 00:50:59,683
You become more beautiful every day.

621
00:50:59,684 --> 00:51:03,404
You look just like Won Bin.

622
00:51:04,044 --> 00:51:07,084
If I'm Won Bin, you must be Lee Nayoung!

623
00:51:07,744 --> 00:51:09,893
I don't know!

624
00:51:09,894 --> 00:51:11,414
You must know!

625
00:51:11,844 --> 00:51:13,224
Won Bin?

626
00:51:14,234 --> 00:51:15,653
Nayoung, we'll see you later.

627
00:51:15,654 --> 00:51:16,584
Good luck.

628
00:51:16,585 --> 00:51:18,333
Everyone agrees!

629
00:51:18,334 --> 00:51:19,863
- You're Won Bin?
- Aunt!

630
00:51:19,864 --> 00:51:22,263
- You're Lee Nayoung.
- Aunt!

631
00:51:22,264 --> 00:51:23,503
- Eunha!
- You're here?

632
00:51:23,504 --> 00:51:24,834
Haengsuk, congratulations.

633
00:51:25,454 --> 00:51:26,963
Eunha, you look so pretty.

634
00:51:26,964 --> 00:51:28,063
Twirl for me.

635
00:51:28,064 --> 00:51:30,783
You're the prettiest.

636
00:51:30,784 --> 00:51:33,073
You're the prettiest in the world today.

637
00:51:33,074 --> 00:51:34,963
- Oh!
- She's not.

638
00:51:34,964 --> 00:51:36,504
She's old.

639
00:51:37,124 --> 00:51:39,063
If you're jealous, just say so.

640
00:51:39,064 --> 00:51:40,343
Who, me?

641
00:51:40,344 --> 00:51:42,373
I can get married today if I wanted to.

642
00:51:42,374 --> 00:51:43,583
Then go ahead.

643
00:51:43,584 --> 00:51:45,214
She's getting married today.

644
00:51:58,784 --> 00:52:01,663
Next is the bride's family photo.

645
00:52:01,664 --> 00:52:02,944
Please gather around.

646
00:52:08,854 --> 00:52:10,223
Oh, wait.

647
00:52:10,224 --> 00:52:13,843
Mr. Photographer, just a second.

648
00:52:13,844 --> 00:52:15,444
Taesu!

649
00:52:19,084 --> 00:52:22,083
She wants us in the photo.

650
00:52:22,084 --> 00:52:23,823
Let's go.

651
00:52:23,824 --> 00:52:24,933
But honey,

652
00:52:24,934 --> 00:52:26,313
let's go.

653
00:52:26,314 --> 00:52:28,134
It's embarrassing.

654
00:52:32,164 --> 00:52:33,533
Please come.

655
00:52:33,534 --> 00:52:35,084
Everyone's waiting.

656
00:52:36,524 --> 00:52:39,003
We'll just leave.

657
00:52:39,004 --> 00:52:43,334
Can't you stand in Sangjun's place?

658
00:52:45,404 --> 00:52:50,494
My mother needs a son today.

659
00:52:52,094 --> 00:52:54,413
To her and my children,

660
00:52:54,414 --> 00:52:57,304
you are Sangjun's replacement.

661
00:52:57,844 --> 00:52:59,773
That's what Sangjun

662
00:52:59,774 --> 00:53:02,994
wanted to ask you to do for us.

663
00:53:07,514 --> 00:53:09,133
- Come.
- Hey,

664
00:53:09,134 --> 00:53:10,293
Taesu,

665
00:53:10,294 --> 00:53:11,793
what can we do?

666
00:53:11,794 --> 00:53:13,473
We don't have relatives,

667
00:53:13,474 --> 00:53:16,354
so you have to fill in for them.

668
00:53:17,234 --> 00:53:19,324
Mother, I...

669
00:53:21,184 --> 00:53:23,903
Yes, I'm your mother.

670
00:53:23,904 --> 00:53:27,043
I fed you and Sangjun for years and years.

671
00:53:27,044 --> 00:53:28,874
I'm your mom.

672
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:33,243
What are you waiting for?

673
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:35,284
Come and stand with us.

674
00:53:35,844 --> 00:53:37,743
Yeongju, bring your mom and dad.

675
00:53:37,744 --> 00:53:39,084
Okay.

676
00:53:44,594 --> 00:53:45,874
Eunha.

677
00:53:51,264 --> 00:53:52,744
Let's go.

678
00:53:54,324 --> 00:53:55,534
Let's go.

679
00:53:56,874 --> 00:53:58,404
Please stand together.

680
00:54:59,134 --> 00:55:00,553
Everyone, smile.

681
00:55:00,554 --> 00:55:01,734
Smile.

00:55:02,814 --> 00:55:04,684
One, two, three!

00:55:31,874 --> 00:55:33,854
(Thank you for watching Bluebird's House.)

(KBS 2TV Weekend Drama, Bluebird's House)

685
00:56:55,054 --> 00:56:58,273
You're a sidekick, you bastard.

686
00:56:58,274 --> 00:57:00,054
- Seriously?
- I'm sorry.

687
00:57:01,614 --> 00:57:02,863
You'll drop them all.

688

Thank you.

689
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:09,334
Squeeze your brains!

690
00:57:09,335 --> 00:57:11,104
Jang Hyeondo!

691
00:57:11,854 --> 00:57:13,083
Squeeze your brains if you have to,

692
00:57:13,084 --> 00:57:14,143
and bring me some ideas!

693
00:57:14,144 --> 00:57:15,524
Don't laugh!

694
00:57:17,944 --> 00:57:21,853
Go to Daejeon and deliv, deliver...

695
00:57:21,854 --> 00:57:22,924
I'm sorry.

696
00:57:23,324 --> 00:57:25,523
- It's okay.
- It's not...

697
00:57:25,524 --> 00:57:27,594
Let's go see a doctor. I'll go again.

698

That's... Uh...

I'm so sorry!

700
00:57:39,614 --> 00:57:41,914
I can't believe we...

701
00:57:42,934 --> 00:57:44,074
That really hurt!

702
00:57:57,624 --> 00:57:58,754
It's not sweet.

703
00:58:04,434 --> 00:58:05,674
Why?

704
00:58:06,854 --> 00:58:08,203
So awkward. I'm sorry.

705
00:58:08,204 --> 00:58:09,834
You have nothing to say, right?

706
00:58:10,544 --> 00:58:12,533
What's wrong with you?

707
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:13,634
I'm sorry.

708
00:58:15,954 --> 00:58:18,234
With that money, I can...

709
00:58:18,884 --> 00:58:20,564
I can't last 10 minutes...

710
00:58:21,534 --> 00:58:24,124
You told me to train for... I'm sorry.
