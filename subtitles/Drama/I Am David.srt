1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,340
Are you listening to me?

2
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:46,770
You must escape from here tonight.
It's your only chance to stay alive.

3
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,300
If you follow my instructions
and make it out of the camp...

4
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,880
...travel when it's dark
to flee Bulgaria so you won't be seen.

5
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,450
They'll be everywhere waiting
to arrest you...

6
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,480
...and unless you're very careful,
you'll be caught.

7
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,890
If you make it across the border,
you must get this envelope to Denmark.

8
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,550
First, head south to Salonika and hide
on a ship that's going to Italy.

9
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,980
When you arrive there,
travel north as far as you can.

10
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,300
Your journey will be long
and it may be impossible...

11
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,400
... but you must get this evelope
to the authorities in Denmark.

12
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,150
You must not open it.

13
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,320
If anyone sees it's contents
before you get there...

14
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,920
...you'll end up back here.

15
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,510
Do you understand?

16
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,360
I know you've lived
in this camp your entire life...

17
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,110
...but there is a world outside it.

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,450
However, it's a very dangerous world.

19
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,020
Trust no one.

20
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,080
When the time comes,
get from the barracks to the west fence.

21
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,900
When you see the signal,

22
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,010
you will have 30 seconds
to get over the fence...

23
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,250
...before the current is turned back on.

24
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,310
Shoot me.

25
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,920
Hidden behind the log at the edge
of the field...

26
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,570
...you will find a bunndle filled with
items you will need for your journey.

27
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,500
If you follow my instructions
and make it out of the camp...

28
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,270
...travel when it's dark
to flee Bulgaria so you won't be seen.

29
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,660
You must do everything I just told you
if you want to escape.

30
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,770
They're moving me
to another camp tomorrow...

31
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,240
...and I can no longer watch over you.

32
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,960
Follow your compass south to Salonika.

33
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,520
Travel there by any means possible.

34
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,210
Who did it?

35
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,890
Get out! Get out now!

36
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,350
You want to escape this paradise?
Are you that ungrateful?

37
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,350
The border between Bulgaria
and Greece is heavily gurarded...

38
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,670
...and much of the fence is strung
with alarm wires. Do not touch it.

39
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:53,340
Stop him! Stop him! Stop, little boy!

40
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,320
Come back here! Come back!

41
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,140
Stop! Where do you think you're going?
You cannot escape!

42
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,670
Stop! We will get you!

43
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,290
Stop!

44
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,950
Stop!

45
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,510
We will get you!

46
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,290
Follow your compass south to Salonika...

47
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,590
...and hide on a ship
that's going to Italy.

48
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,700
-Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
-Okay. Good work.

49
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,400
Hey! Why isn't this hatch closed?

50
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,740
Johannes...

51
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,980
...am I dead?

52
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,490
No.

53
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,150
I don't think I can make it.
They're going to find me.

54
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,930
Not if you're careful.
You must remain unseen.

55
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,790
And if you are seen,

56
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,280
you must blend in with the people
around you.

57
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:22,430
How?

58
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,180
You know many languages from
the different men you knew in the camp.

59
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,780
Just listen closely and you'll be able
to speak to people...

60
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,510
...and understand them.

61
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,690
I'm afraid.

62
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,340
There are places where
the world is good.

63
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,260
I've seen them.

64
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,490
A long time ago, but I have seen them.

65
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,080
You will, too.

66
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,870
Why didn't you come with me?

67
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,040
This is your journey.

68
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,840
-I have my own.
-But what am I looking for?

69
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,330
What am I gonna find in Denmark?

70
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,990
Freedom.

71
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,310
But I don't even know who I am.

72
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,930
What are you doing in my spot?

73
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,220
You dind't touch my magazines, did you?

74
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,430
I've got to report all stowaways
to the captain. You're in big trouble.

75
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,690
No, please don't tell him.
I need to get to Italy.

76
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,120
I'll give you this
if you don't turn me in!

77
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,920
Pearl handle.

78
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,510
Pretty nice. It looks Soviet.

79
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,290
Throw in the compass
and you've got a deal.

80
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,140
I can't. Just the knife.

81
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,360
You know, I could take this
and trun you in anyway.

82
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,180
But I'm an honest guy...

83
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:06,330
...and l'd probably get in trouble
for not turning you in sooner.

84
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,770
Okay, you've got yourself a deal.

85
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,300
Roberto, quit looking
at your magazines and get up here!

86
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,210
Keep your pants on, I'll be right up.

87
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,540
Look, I can't take a chance
on anybody seeing you...

88
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,740
...getting off the ship
when we get into port.

89
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,560
So when we're close to shore,
I'll lower you overboard...

90
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,800
...then you can swim to land.

91
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,900
Don't worry. The current will help you
drift to the coast.

92
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,880
You all set?

93
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,380
Have fun.

94
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:47,070
Once you arrive in Italy,
travel north until you reach Denmark.

95
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,350
Why do they hate us so much, Johannes?

96
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,060
Because it's easy to hate people

97
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,270
who don't believe
the same things you do.

98
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,740
Did my parents not believe what
the guards believe?

99
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,430
Is that why I'm in here?

100
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,700
I didn't know anything
about your parents, but...

101
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,330
...I would assume so.

102
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,130
I don't remember them.

103
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,320
Do you know what they were like?

104
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,230
What they believed ?
Where we were from?

105
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,780
David...

106
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,700
...I don't know anything about you.

107
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,450
I wish I were dead.

108
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,300
Don't ever say that.
Don't even think it.

109
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,740
Why not? There's nothing good here.

110
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,970
What's the point in even staying alive?

111
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,450
If you're alive, you can change things.
If you're dead, you can't.

112
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,680
Do whatever you can to stay alive,
no matter what. Go.

113
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,240
I know you've lived
in this camp your entire life...

114
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,790
...but there is a world outside it.

115
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,840
However, it's a very dangerous world.

116
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,690
Trust no one.

117
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,420
Beautiful loaves, huh?

118
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,410
Sorry to scare you.

119
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,710
You want to get some bread?

120
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,970
-Yes, please.
-Do you have any money?

121
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,670
No.

122
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,100
I'm afraid my bread is not free.

123
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,760
Where do you live?

124
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,050
I'm in the circus.

125
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,260
In the circus?

126
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:28,040
Well, it's not going to be here
for another 2 weeks.

127
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,500
I think you are a little early.

128
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,530
Where can I get some money
for some bread, sir?

129
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,240
Just take a look at this kitchen.

130
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,460
It's spotless.

131
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,910
And over there,
that's a traditional wood-burning oven.

132
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,980
You know what Abruzzi
down the street bakes his bread with?

133
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,460
Gas.

134
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:53,320
And still people buy from him
instead of me! It's unbelievable!

135
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,680
You know,
before I can give you some bread...

136
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,440
...you have to do something for me.

137
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,080
-You have to smile.
-Why?

138
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:10,660
Why? Because you're about to have
the best bread in Italy.

139
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,290
That's why.

140
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,460
Oh, Saint Elizabeth...

141
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,460
...the boy wants to know why
he should smile.

142
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,960
I don't think he know how to.

143
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,560
Who's that?

144
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,630
That's Saint Elizabeth.

145
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,030
She's the patron saint of bakers.

146
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,490
She takes care of everyone
who needs help.

147
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,920
But especially bakers.

148
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,390
Here, see for yourself.

149
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,490
You keep that...

150
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:51,040
...and maybe she'll help you
out sometime, too.

151
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,740
I'll tell you what.

152
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:57,280
Just stay here and I'll pick you
out a nice, fresh loaf.

153
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,760
There is something about his face...

154
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,900
...his eyes.

155
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,230
They are not the eyes of a normal boy.

156
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,600
Come and see for yourselves.

157
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,620
My friends want to talk to you.

158
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,330
They just want to know who you are.
Nothing to worry about.

159
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,870
We need to ask you a few questions.

160
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,070
I'm trying to help you.
You've got to believe me!

161
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,450
Let me go!

162
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,120
Travel north as far as you can.

163
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,130
Good luck to you.

164
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,510
Line up, right now! Line up!

165
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:22,530
Line up over here right now! Right now!

166
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,360
Who did it?

167
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,310
Which one of you is responsible?

168
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,980
It was him. I know it.

169
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,380
Shoot him!

170
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,270
Saint Elizabeth...

171
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,050
...my name is David...

172
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,690
...and, well, the baker told me that
you help people.

173
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,490
I want to get to Denmark...

174
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,370
...and I need help getting out
of these woods.

175
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,580
I have to get to Denmark...

176
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,430
...and I can't if I'm lost in here.

177
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,900
You must remain unseen.

178
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,170
And if you are seen,

179
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:43,170
you must blend in with the people
around you.

180
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,330
Oh, Saint Elizabeth,

181
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,360
the boy wants to know why
he should smile.

182
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,810
I don't think he knows how to.

183
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:09,790
Saint Elizabeth, remember how I said
I wouldn't ask you for anything else?

184
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,240
Go away! Please go away!

185
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,070
I didn't mean to make you mad.

186
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,980
I promise,
I was just trying to blend in.

187
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,470
Gina! Be quiet!

188
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,110
What are you doing in my vineyard?
Were you eating my grapes?

189
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:42,180
Well, it's a good thing you are here
because I need help. Come along.

190
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:44,870
Come on.

191
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,580
Thank God Gina caught you.
I'm desperate.

192
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,160
I need you to run this wine over
to the Bertelli's party.

193
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,240
Please be careful.

194
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,300
Now, it's 3 farms up the road
and here's 2 lira for your trouble.

195
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,810
What? I'm not giving you more.

196
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:07,150
-Do you know which way is north?
-What do I look like, a compass?

197
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,160
I have no idea.
Ask the Bertellis. Now go.

198
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:12,550
Go, go. Go!

199
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,970
Gina, you bad dog! Come!

200
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,880
Finally!

201
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:15,370
Where have you been?
You should have been here an hour ago.

202
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,290
Good news, everyone! The wine is here.

203
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,220
3 cheers for the delivery boy!

204
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,540
I don't need any strange-looking
urchins at my party.

205
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,270
Now scat!

206
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,510
What's the matter with you?

207
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,010
You have to go to the toilet
or something?

208
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,940
-l'd like to buy some food, please.
-Well, congratulations.

209
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,770
-You came to the right place.
-l'd like one of those...

210
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,830
...that, and one of those.

211
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,500
You got money?

212
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,410
Why don't I just sell you
the whole store for that?

213
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,160
Yeah, and I'll throw in my wife
and kids, too.

214
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,010
Get lost.

215
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,570
David!

216
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:16,870
Mother...

217
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,160
If you'd ever listen to me,
this kind of thing wouldn't happen.

218
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:24,490
Look, just calm down.
We can't be that far from a gas station.

219
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,410
I'm not going to go hiking off
when we don't know where we're going.

220
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,740
I don't even have the right shose on.

221
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,070
Excuse me, young man?

222
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,350
We need some help.

223
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,920
Do you know if there's a gas station
around here?

224
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,360
The kid's not gonna speak English.
Use your Italian.

225
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,320
Right.

226
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,790
My wine shop needs steak.

227
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:59,300
My wine shop needs steak.

228
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,430
No?

229
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,280
My wine shop needs steak?

230
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,580
I saw a place back there where
they do that.

231
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,820
Oh, you speak English. Great.

232
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:15,790
Would you go get us some gas?
I'll give you a tip if you do.

233
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,200
Yes, sir.

234
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,200
Sir...

235
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,650
...l'd like to buy some things.

236
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,200
Hey!

237
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,420
What are you doing on my property?
Think you're gonna steal something?

238
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,730
Come on and fight me!

239
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,410
What's this? Something else you stole?

240
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,840
-Give me that, that's mine.
-Oh, yeah? I think it's mine now.

241
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,530
Go ahead and run, little piggy!

242
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,010
And don't ever come back!

243
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,940
Johannes...

244
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,900
...I want to escape.

245
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,910
You said that if we weren't dead,
we could change things.

246
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,950
But how do we know
they're going to let us live?

247
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,010
We don't.

248
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,480
Then we should leave while we still can.

249
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,560
-They'd kill us if we tried.
-They're going to kill us anyway.

250
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,030
We should do whatever
we can to stay alive.

251
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,460
That's what you said.

252
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,830
You're scared.

253
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,560
Yes.

254
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,260
I am.

255
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,980
I don't want to be scared anymore,
Johannes.

256
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,520
Neither do I.

257
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,980
Garlo! Help!

258
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,920
Help!

259
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,540
Help!

260
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,350
Help!

261
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,840
Don't breathe!

262
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,530
I love you, David.

263
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,470
Are you awake?

264
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:37,580
I was watching you.

265
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,200
I wanted to make sure
you were all right.

266
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,240
How long have I been asleep?

267
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,040
Since yesterday.

268
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:47,080
You must have been tired.

269
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,800
When the doctor came,
you didn't even waske up.

270
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,140
Mother put you under the covers.

271
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,860
Where's my bundle?

272
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,260
What bundle?

273
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,450
Nothing. I was just confused.

274
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,140
You got burned...

275
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,420
...but not very bad.

276
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,140
I got burned, too. See?

277
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,780
Mine weren't bad, either,
but Cecha and Angelo are in trouble.

278
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,340
Papa made them go the bed
without supper...

279
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,410
...because they weren't supposed
to be playing with fire.

280
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,740
What's your name?

281
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,710
-David.
-I'm Maria.

282
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,710
Thank you for saving me, David.

283
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,820
Papa said I could have died.

284
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,860
You could have, too.

285
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,210
You're very brave.

286
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,790
Did I just smile at you?

287
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,660
Yes. How come?

288
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,750
I don't know.

289
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,270
Is it because you think I look funny?

290
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,550
No.

291
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,880
Then myabe you love me.

292
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,510
You're awake.

293
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,360
Maria, did you wake him up?

294
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,060
I told you not to.

295
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:06,470
His name is David, Mama,
and he woke up on his own.

296
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,100
Didn't you?

297
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:12,810
Go downstairs and get ready for lunch.
David will be down in a minute.

298
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,470
Yes, Mama.

299
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,310
You saved my Maria.

300
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:24,970
For this...

301
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,380
...I owe you my life.

302
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,860
Are you feeling okay?

303
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,980
We have to get hold of your parents now
that you're awake.

304
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,670
They must be very worried.

305
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,460
We've been asking around,
but no one knows where you're from.

306
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,760
They won't be worried about me.

307
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:48,040
I don't live around here.
I'm on my way somewhere.

308
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,390
By yourself?

309
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,820
Where are you going?

310
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,790
Lunch is ready, senora.

311
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,220
Thank you, Julia.

312
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,360
Well...

313
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,780
...if you're away from home...

314
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,240
...then I want you to stay
with us for a few days.

315
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,090
The doctor said you should rest
and let your burns heal.

316
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:13,540
I have brought you
some of Carlo's old clothes.

317
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,650
Now, get dressed and come downstaris.

318
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,170
We've made a special lunch
in your honor.

319
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,740
Everyone's dying to meet you.

320
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,210
I just wanted to tell you I was sorry.

321
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,710
I didn't mean to beat you up yesterday.

322
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,600
Look, I thought you were one
of the boys who stole Maria's bike.

323
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:09,450
You probably would have done
the same thing, right?

324
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,130
-No.
-Carlo, come down to lunch!

325
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,090
-I called you 5 minutes ago!
-Coming.

326
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,350
Please don't tell my parents
what happened yesterday, okay?

327
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,100
I didn't mean it, I swear.

328
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,550
All right?

329
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,030
Thanks.

330
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,170
Come on.

331
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:55,050
David, my name is Giovanni Rescigno
and I'm Maria's father.

332
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,800
It's n honor to hv you here in our home.

333
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:04,140
David, come over here.
Maria wants you to sit next to her.

334
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:07,790
Maria, I know it's your turn
to say grace...

335
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,110
...but it you don't mind,
l'd like to say it today.

336
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,390
Dear God, we thank you...

337
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,820
...for this wonderful food
of which we're about to partake...

338
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,020
...and for all the bounty
which you provide for us.

339
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:26,890
We especially want to thank you
for sending us David...

340
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:29,330
...whose bravery and selflessness...

341
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:33,230
...has kept our dearest Maria safe
and well.

342
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:38,370
Please bless David
and our little family...

343
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:43,380
...and guide us so that we may continue
to perform your good works.

344
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,610
Thank you so very much.

345
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:47,640
Amen.

346
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:52,680
Well, David, I don't know about you,
but I'm starving.

347
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,480
Let's eat.

348
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,440
It's okay, David?

349
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:00,660
Is it nice to have a family?

350
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:03,920
I like it...

351
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:07,250
...but I don't know anyone
who doesn't have one.

352
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,220
Don't you have a family?

353
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:12,460
I don't know, but l'd like one.

354
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,600
We can be your family.

355
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:18,310
You can be an honorary memeber.

356
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:30,280
Do you like your brother Carlo?

357
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,240
Yes, but he makes fun of me a lot.

358
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,640
He calls me "crybaby",
but I don't cry as much as I used to.

359
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:40,070
Don't you like him?

360
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,510
There's a lot of people I don't like.

361
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,020
Why not?

362
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:48,580
Becuase the world is filled
with terrible people, Maria...

363
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,790
...and they all do terrible,
evil things.

364
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,370
I've seen them.

365
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:57,930
You don't think that
we are terrible people, do you?

366
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:01,330
-No, not at all.
-Not even Carlo?

367
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:07,820
Let's go inside.
I want to show you something.

368
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:10,900
My papa has lots of poetry books.

369
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:13,200
He reads to me from them.

370
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,550
Shakespeare is my favorite.

371
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:44,300
Do you like Shakespeare's sonnets?

372
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,570
I've never heard them.

373
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,260
You don't know anything good...

374
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,410
...do you?

375
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:54,990
What's that?

376
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,790
That's the Earth.

377
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,430
I've never seen a map like this before.

378
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,460
Do you know how to read it?

379
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,530
Uh-huh.

380
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:09,840
That's Italy...

381
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:11,400
...and there is Russia...

382
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,430
...and there's America.

383
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:15,530
Where's Denmark?

384
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:19,340
That's up here.

385
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,600
Switzerland and Germany
are between them and us.

386
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:28,260
-Have you ever been to Denmark?
-No. Have you?

387
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,630
I'm on my way there now.

388
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,860
You are?
Why are you going to Denmark, David?

389
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,510
You know you're not supposed to be
in here without Papa's permission.

390
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,360
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to read David some poetry.

391
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:42,530
All right.

392
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,230
Why don't you go and cut some flowers
for the dinner table?

393
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,620
-Can David help me?
-No, let David stay here.

394
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,210
Papa and I want to talk to him.

395
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:04,370
How's your hand feeling?

396
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:06,060
Fine.

397
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:10,250
David, Gianni and I just want
to make sure everything's okay with you.

398
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:13,800
This morning you said
you're on your way somewhere.

399
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,370
Where are you going?

400
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,230
I'm going to...

401
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,660
...to meet up with the circus.

402
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,880
The circus?

403
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:27,860
Yes, I'm in the circus.

404
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,370
And what do you do in the circus?

405
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:34,000
-Lots of thing.
-And that's where your parents are?

406
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,920
Yes.

407
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:38,800
Why are your parents letting
you travel by yourself?

408
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:43,310
-It's okay. They don't mind.
-David, are you lying to us?

409
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,850
No.

410
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:49,060
Are you lying to us?

411
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:52,200
In this house, lies are not permitted.

412
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:55,180
-No, I swear!
-Okay.

413
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,880
It's okay, David. It's okay.

414
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:59,800
We just wanted to make sure everything
was all right.

415
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,720
You don't have to worry.
My goodness, we wouldn't hurt you.

416
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:08,050
We're sorry to ask you
so many questions.

417
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:14,120
Why don't you go
and get ready for dinner?

418
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,990
You stole it.

419
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:06,180
When no one was around,
I went into the man's office.

420
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,660
do you know what they'll do to
you if they find it?

421
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:09,860
It was in his desk.

422
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,340
Promise me you'll never take something
that's not yours again.

423
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,410
You must promise me that.

424
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:25,330
Who did it?
Which one of you is responsible?

425
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,500
It was him. I know it.

426
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,300
Shoot him. They must be taught a lesson.

427
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:47,660
No, it was him.

428
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:41,590
Take care of her, Saint Elizabeth.

429
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:45,900
I don't deserve to have
you look after me anymore.

430
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,080
I don't deserve anything good.

431
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,130
Please tell Maria that I'm sorry.

432
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,000
And if you talk to Johannes...

433
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:04,080
...tell him I'm sorry, too.

434
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,190
-Workers of the world...
-Unite!

435
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:23,480
-Workers of the world...
-Unite!

436
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,740
That was a big mistake, boy.

437
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,740
It wasn't me! I didn't throw it!

438
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:58,830
Let me out!

439
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:29,720
Where do you think you're going?
Come on!

440
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,710
You better stay right there, boy!

441
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,100
Come back!

442
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:42,160
Come back here!

443
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,850
Where do you think you're going?
Come here!

444
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,630
I'll find you, boy!

445
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:12,920
Hey, my firiend!
I see you made it to shore. Well done.

446
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:15,050
Roberto? Why aren't you on the ship?

447
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:18,510
I quit. It was too boring.

448
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:22,220
Besides, they caught me
stealing a crate of tomatoes.

449
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,820
You need a ride?

450
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:25,480
Hop in.

451
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,420
Where are you going to?

452
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:36,270
-Denmark.
-Denmark?

453
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:40,090
That's a long way.
I'm only going to Milan.

454
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:43,730
-That's okay.
-I was in Denmark a few summers ago.

455
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:47,610
It's pretty nice.
Lots of good-looking girls.

456
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,270
Good-bye, my friend, and good luck.

457
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,610
Say hello to Denmark for me.

458
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:36,720
Hello.

459
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:39,000
I thought there was somebody there.

460
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:43,180
I always know when someone's looking
at me behind my back.

461
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:46,320
some sort of psychic energy,
don't you think?

462
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:49,750
Come over and take a look at this,
will you?

463
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,250
I've been trying all morning...

464
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:55,760
...to capture the essence
of this beautiful place.

465
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:59,030
Usually when I come up here,
it inspires me...

466
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,640
...but today, nothing seems
to be working for me.

467
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,080
What do you think?

468
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,120
It's very pretty.

469
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,310
Is it?
It all seems a bit lifeless to me.

470
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:17,590
You've got a very interesting face.

471
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,890
Would you mind if I painted it?

472
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:22,320
What color do you want to paint
my face?

473
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:24,760
I like that.

474
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,730
I think you'll make quite
a challenging subject.

475
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:30,450
That is, if you don't mind
sitting for a bit.

476
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:35,310
I'm Sophie, by the way.
What's your name?

477
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:36,180
David.

478
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,180
David? That's too perfect.

479
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:44,070
Michelangelo had his David,
so you've got to let me have mine.

480
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:55,000
You're very good at sitting still,
David.

481
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:59,800
Most aduIts I paint can't sit still
for a minute without fidgeting.

482
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,640
I always tell them the more they move...

483
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:05,390
...the worse they look in the picture.

484
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:10,360
But that doesn't mean
you can't move your mouth.

485
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:14,170
Talking won't ruin the painting.
I'm not that bad.

486
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,760
I don't really have anything to say.

487
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:19,060
Well, then you don't have
to say anything.

488
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:21,500
There are an awful lot of people
in this world...

489
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:22,870
...who have nothing to say,

490
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,780
but seem to spend
all their time talking.

491
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:29,650
You're right to conserve your words.

492
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:32,400
It means you'll be a man
with great power.

493
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:34,610
I don't want to be a man of great power.

494
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:37,880
Then you don't have to be.

495
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:44,310
Just be happy that you're the kind
of person who could be if he wanted to.

496
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,860
I'm having such trouble...

497
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:51,190
...with your eyes.

498
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:55,090
I've never had to use
so much black paint before.

499
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:59,350
Such serious eyes.

500
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:05,110
Such a serious face.

501
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:18,170
Well, just one or two more finishing
touches and then we're done.

502
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,280
I wish my house was a bit closer.
l'd love to invite you to lunch...

503
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:26,320
...to repay you for your kindness.

504
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:27,470
Where do you live?

505
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,960
Just over the border, in Switzerland.

506
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:35,990
David...

507
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:40,120
...are you quite sure your parents
won't mind you coming this far?

508
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:42,450
It's okay. They don't mind.

509
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:45,240
They don't live around here anyway.

510
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:47,570
I see.

511
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,950
What's that?

512
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:54,550
That's just my sketchbook.

513
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:56,850
All my drawings are in there.

514
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:02,070
-Can I look at them, please?
-You can if you want to.

515
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:04,620
But I warn you, they're not very good.

516
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:07,730
I went to a few art classes
when I was younger...

517
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:10,730
...but I never really kept up with it.

518
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,160
I only studied painting again
a year ago.

519
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,220
Just for my own amusement.

520
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:27,480
Who's that?

521
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:32,790
That's just a boy
I knew a long time ago.

522
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:36,920
I told you they were not very good.

523
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,790
-I have to get out.
-What?

524
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:47,380
Is something the matter?

525
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:50,870
You can do whatever you want.
I thought you want to see Switzerland.

526
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,890
I do.

527
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,830
Well, now...

528
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,660
...they're going to ask us
for identification. Do you have any?

529
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:09,460
-No.
-Well, it doesn't really matter.

530
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,820
This is an easy border.
It shouldn't be a problem.

531
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,900
Okay?

532
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:16,310
Okay.

533
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:29,340
-Good day, ma'am.
-Good morning.

534
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:32,020
-Your papers, please.
-Yes, of course.

535
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:42,030
-And for the boy also.
-This is my grandson, officer...

536
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:45,470
...and we left the house in such
a hurry this morning...

537
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:48,980
...he forgot
to bring his identification.

538
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:53,080
I don't know.

539
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:56,690
Our orders are to check
everyone's papers, even children.

540
01:03:58,490 --> 01:04:01,880
Couldn't you relax the rules for a bit?

541
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,150
All he wants to do is to come
into your country...

542
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:08,950
...overthrow the government
and then rush right out again.

543
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:16,400
All right, Mrs. Anderson.
Have a nice day.

544
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,230
And young man...

545
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:23,510
...see if you can get us pay raises
while you're taking over our country.

546
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:35,290
There, you see? No problem.

547
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:37,520
Now we can go and have some lunch.

548
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:48,490
I'm afraid there's
no escaping my artwork.

549
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,830
But it's less expensive
than buying real paintings.

550
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:54,000
They look like real paintings to me.

551
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:55,600
But wait a minute.

552
01:04:55,740 --> 01:05:00,010
We have to add my latest work
to the gallery wall.

553
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,160
Hold it a minute, would you?

554
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:07,900
Thank you.

555
01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:20,500
Is that what I look like?

556
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:24,430
To me, yes. It's my impression of you.

557
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:28,400
That's why
it's called impressionistic painting.

558
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:31,030
So...

559
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,670
...what do you see when you look at it?

560
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:39,120
Me?

561
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:43,560
Well, yes.
That's not quite what I meant.

562
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,520
you have to look
at paintings differently...

563
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:49,550
...from the way
you look at other things.

564
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:51,510
More closely...

565
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:55,060
...to see what it says to you.

566
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,760
Well...

567
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:09,240
...when I look at the boy
in that painting...

568
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:14,070
...I see a very intelligent,
very serious person...

569
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:16,120
...and a good person.

570
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:18,040
But...

571
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:23,340
...ther's something about the eyes...

572
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:28,630
...and the face that seems lost and sad.

573
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:31,790
But that's as far as I can see...

574
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:37,230
...because he doesn't want to
let the world see any further.

575
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:41,750
-Do you really see all that?
-Yes. Yes, I do.

576
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,160
Oops, there's our tea.

577
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:58,390
I hope there's enough food for you.
I'm a very light eater...

578
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:01,520
...but I know boys
can pack away quite a lot.

579
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:04,050
I'm fine. It's very nice. Thank you.

580
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:05,240
Good.

581
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:09,740
Hello, Annette.
I thought you might smell our food.

582
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:12,600
Or have you come to say hello
to our guest?

583
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,870
Do you like cats?

584
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,970
I don't know. I guess so.

585
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:19,790
Well, if you knew Annette, you would.

586
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:24,890
She's very sweet and also very funny,
aren't you, pussycat?

587
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:26,480
What's that?

588
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,950
What?

589
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,530
This?

590
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,780
It's a locket.

591
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:38,430
I've had it for ages.
It belonged to my mother.

592
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,690
And look, I'll show you.

593
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:44,570
My father had it inscribed on the back.

594
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:50,000
He gave it to her on their wedding day.

595
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:58,000
Is that the same boy that you drew?

596
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:01,220
Yes.

597
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:05,370
That's my son, Peter.

598
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:09,070
Or he was my son.

599
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:15,090
He died not long after that picture
was taken.

600
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:19,350
-What happened?
-Pneumonia.

601
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:22,650
He'd always been a frail child...

602
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:26,710
...but he was a very sweet,
very loving boy.

603
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:28,660
Did he live here with you?

604
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:32,790
No, we all lived in Zurich then. But...

605
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:35,440
...some other things happened...

606
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:37,950
...after Peter died and...

607
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:40,760
...and I decided to move up here.

608
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:45,470
And besides,
who wouldn't want to live up here?

609
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:49,260
It's such a beautiful place,
don't you think?

610
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,530
We think so, don't we, pussycat?

611
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:57,180
Would you like to hold her?

612
01:08:57,370 --> 01:09:00,160
-She won't bite.
-Okay.

613
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,060
She's so soft.

614
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,250
And she's vibrating.

615
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:14,100
She's purring, David.

616
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:17,050
Have you never stroked a cat before?

617
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:18,680
No.

618
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:35,130
Where do you live, David?

619
01:09:52,930 --> 01:09:54,270
Nowhere.

620
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:59,190
I'm in the circus.

621
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:01,360
In the circus?

622
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:05,140
Oh, my goodness.
That must be very interesting.

623
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,960
Yes, it is. It's very interesting.

624
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,690
If you need a place to stay the night...

625
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:13,660
-...you're very welcome to stay here.
-No.

626
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:17,460
I can't. I have to go.
I can't stay anywhere anymore.

627
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:21,040
David, if there's something
troubling you...

628
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:24,340
...l'd very much like to help you
if I can.

629
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:29,690
Please...

630
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:32,950
-...don't turn me in.
-Turn you in to whom?

631
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,490
To them.

632
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:36,820
To him, to anyone.

633
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:41,150
I wouldn't dream of turning you
in to anybody for any reason.

634
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:45,370
You're quite safe here, David.
You're safe.

635
01:10:45,790 --> 01:10:48,270
From the guards?

636
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,250
From everybody.

637
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:55,640
I want to tell you everything,
Sophie, but I can't.

638
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:57,110
I just can't.

639
01:10:57,790 --> 01:11:00,510
You don't have to tell me anything.

640
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:03,360
I just want you to know that
you're safe here...

641
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:06,330
...and that everything
will be all right.

642
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:26,480
Sleep well, David.

643
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:29,080
Everything's all right.

644
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:14,230
Good morning, David.
I hope I didn't wake you.

645
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:17,710
I have to go to the village.

646
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:21,300
I promised to take some food
to a friend of mine who's sick.

647
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:24,980
You can come along if you want to.

648
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:34,010
Why do people do such terrible things?

649
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:36,790
Like what?

650
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:41,390
Like beat people and kill them,
and make them prisoners.

651
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:45,080
Most people don't do that.

652
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:55,350
My friend Johannes always used
to tell me...

653
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,660
..."trust no one."

654
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:01,780
Life wouldn't be worth living
if you did that, David.

655
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:07,740
You can be cautious,
but you have to let people in.

656
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:11,740
How do you know if they're bad or not?

657
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:16,790
David, most people are good.

658
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:20,920
They have families and friends...

659
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:25,430
...and they just want to live their
lives as happily as they can.

660
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:29,720
There will always be bad people
in this world...

661
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:33,400
...and you'll usually know
them when you meet them...

662
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:35,540
...but sometimes you won't.

663
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,990
But you can't let that stop you from...

664
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:44,290
...living your life fully and freely...

665
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:46,900
...and making friends...

666
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,590
...and seeing the goodness in people.

667
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:55,120
Because if you don't do that,
you'll never find any happiness.

668
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:06,100
Now this is my friend's house.

669
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:08,610
But you don't need to come in, David.

670
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:13,110
Why don't you go exploring?
Look around some of the shops.

671
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:17,950
I'll meet you in the bookshop
in a little while, okay?

672
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,540
They're nice people, David.

673
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:27,450
You don't have to worry about anything.

674
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:28,890
Okay?

675
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:35,380
Hello.

676
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:39,320
And hello to you.

677
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:45,700
You must do everything I just told you
if you want to escape.

678
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:47,770
They're moving
me to another camp tomorrow...

679
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:50,620
...and I can no longer watch over you.

680
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:55,120
This is the only way
you'll ever be safe.

681
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:57,310
Do you understand?

682
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:00,660
I know you've lived in this camp
your entire life...

683
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:03,420
...but there is a world outside it.

684
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:08,020
However, it's a very dangerous world.
Trust no one.

685
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:11,490
And...

686
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:14,070
...I'm sorry about your friend Johannes.

687
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:56,660
I've seen this bood before.

688
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,540
What is it?

689
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:03,390
That's a wonderful book, David.

690
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:07,610
It was written by a woman
who lost her husband and her son...

691
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:10,240
...in Bulgaria after the war.

692
01:20:10,370 --> 01:20:12,280
The husband came from England.

693
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:13,910
When he went to Bulgaria

694
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:15,700
to rouse people against
the communists...

695
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,840
...he took her and the boy with him.

696
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:22,840
But they were all arrested,
and the man and the boy were killed.

697
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:25,180
But one of the guards
had known the woman...

698
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:28,510
...since they were children
and he'd always been in love with her.

699
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:33,690
So he arranged for forged papers
and helped her to escape.

700
01:20:33,950 --> 01:20:39,930
-Is the woman still alive?
-Yes. She lives in Denmark.

701
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,810
I am David.

702
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,580
I know, David.

703
01:23:39,710 --> 01:23:41,620
I know.
