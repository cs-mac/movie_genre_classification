1
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,630
I'm 'most frightened to death.

2
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,676
Sure, after you've done it eight or nine
times, you won't even give it a thought.

3
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,184
- Gee, Dot, you look swell.
- Am I all right?

4
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,269
Lovely.

5
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,733
Well, there goes
the maiden's prayer.

6
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,735
I wonder how I'll act.

7
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:14,364
It's like diving overboard-you never know how
the water's going to be till you hit it.

8
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,534
- I’m so nervous.
- Say...

9
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,080
if I could look like you
in a wedding gown, I’d be a bigamist.

10
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,123
Come on.

11
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:19,680
I say, isn't that girl
in the bride's outfit a new model?

12
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,808
Why, yes. She's a salesgirl downstairs.
We're trying her out.

13
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,810
She's got my okay.

14
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:30,774
These guys usually make wisecracks.
Don't let it bother you.

15
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,403
I know all the answers-
men have been insulting me for years.

16
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,949
Say, beautiful.

17
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,201
Doing anything tonight?

18
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,663
I’m taking my two
pet fish out for a drive.

19
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,291
There'll be room for another
if you'd care to go.

20
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,760
Don't talk back to them.
You'll get fired.

21
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,389
When they deliver baloney at my door,
I always give them a receipt.

22
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,496
Honestly, if I ever met a fella...

23
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:30,250
that didn't try to date me up right off
the bat, I think I'd fall on his neck.

24
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,420
He'd probably be too weak to hold you up.

25
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,965
Oh, men are all alike.
Rich or poor-

26
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,844
when it comes to women,
they've only got one idea in their head.

27
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,805
Take those fellas out there today-
When they didn't try to date you up...

28
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,683
you could tell what they were thinking
by the way they looked at ya.

29
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,977
And it isn't only those
swell society guys either.

30
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:53,398
Ridin' the subways during the rush hour,
fellas brushin' up against you-you know what.

31
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,817
Or sit in the theater.
Right away some stranger...

32
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,111
takes a seat next to you
and that knee business starts.

33
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,114
- You said it.
- Don't I know it?

34
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,909
- Well, I'm off. Good night.
- Good night.

35
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,912
After all, I guess
nature made men that way.

36
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,206
It's their great weakness.

37
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,209
And how we women
encourage that weakness.

38
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,921
- Well, I don't.
- Oh, no. I know you don't, Dot.

39
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,048
- Oh, Miss Haley.
- Yes, Mr. Thompson.

40
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,592
- Good night, Dot. Good night.
- So long.

41
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,764
I just wanted to tell you
how awfully well you did this afternoon.

42
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,684
- Oh, thank you so much, Mr. Thompson.
- You were marvelous.

43
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,728
It's been such a hot day-
I thought you might like to take a drive.

44
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,231
Oh, I'd just love to,
Mr. Thompson, but, you see...

45
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,401
- my husband's a prizefighter.
- Oh.

46
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:41,405
Yes. And he heard about a fella here in the
store who tried to make a date with me...

47
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,365
and he's waiting downstairs
now to beat him up.

48
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,659
- Well-Oh.
- Yes.

49
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:49,788
Well, you know, when I asked you to take
the ride, I had nothing wrong in mind.

50
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:53,875
Oh, no, Mr. Thompson.
You see, I never think of things like that.

51
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,211
Well, good night.

52
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,550
Gee, Dot, that husband prizefighter
gag's a pip.

53
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,802
I'm gonna use that one too.

54
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:07,639
- Don't men ever think of anything else?
- Well, hardly ever.

55
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:12,454
What are you looking at the river for,
baby? You ain't expecting anybody, are ya?

56
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:16,083
Yeah, my grandfather's
swimming in from Europe tonight.

57
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,336
I got ya. Well...

58
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,089
when the old guy gets here,
give him my best regards.

59
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,216
You think you can spare any?

60
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:27,177
Hey, Dot.

61
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,679
Hey, Dot. Come on. I've
got something to show ya.

62
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,514
What?

63
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,057
There's a fella over
here who won't flirt.

64
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,225
There ain't no such animal.

65
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,644
- On the level.
- His wife must be watching him.

66
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,522
No, he's all alone.
A girl can't get a tumble.

67
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,566
A girl can't get a tumble?
Wanna bet a quarter?

68
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,568
- That you can make him speak to you?
- Yeah!

69
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,987
- All right. A quarter.
- The bet's on. Where is he?

70
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,948
Come on.

71
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:07,092
You want a little sweet
Come, come, say pretty please.

72
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:11,388
Come on, baby and beg for it.

73
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:16,226
You want a little kiss
So pucker up like this.

74
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,728
Coax me nice and gentle, baby.

75
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:22,357
- Maybe I'll fall dd
- Hey. Do you have to do that?

76
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,316
I'm singin'.

77
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,944
I had an aunt once who used
to make noises like that.

78
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,904
She called it "neuraliga."

79
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,283
Neuralgia must run in your family.

80
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,368
Yeah? Well, listen, kid.

81
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,705
If you want to prove that something
runs in your family, this is the spot.

82
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,915
You got a clear deck.

83
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,795
- I don't know whether I won or not.
- I'll ask him.

84
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,257
Hey, mister. I bet her a quarter
she couldn't get you to talk to her.

85
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,551
- Which one of us wins?
- Oh.

86
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,803
So you're a couple of
them smart Janes, huh?

87
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:55,849
No, we're not. But almost
every fella we meet makes a pass at us.

88
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:59,227
When my girlfriend here said you
wouldn't flirt, I just couldn't believe it.

89
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,730
I suppose you think
when you pass by...

90
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,857
guys just naturally drop dead.

91
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:04,649
No, I don't.

92
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,610
If you don't want them
to flirt with you...

93
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,570
what do you dress like that for?

94
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,656
You wear those clothes for what?
To show off the curves of your body.

95
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,159
Look at the waist.
What's that so low for?

96
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,703
Yeah. So some guy can get an eyeful.

97
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:20,457
And your dress is deliberately made
for the wind to blow up over your knees.

98
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,420
Listen, sister. If you don't want guys
to salute ya, take down your flag.

99
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,923
You're like all other Janes.

100
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,800
If a guy makes a pass at ya,
you wanna call out the police.

101
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,261
And if he don't,
you wanna call the army.

102
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:37,307
- You don't seem to like me.
- I think you're a pain in the neck.

103
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:41,228
Well, my name is Dorothy Haley.
You ain't kiddin' me a bit.

104
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,147
You're like all the other fellas.
You just have a new line. That's all.

105
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,108
- You'll be making a pass at us yet.
- We'd make a great team-

106
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,319
with my- and your conceit.

107
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:52,364
- Oh, hello, Edna.
- Hello there, Jane. How are you?

108
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,491
- Hey. My sister's over here.
Come over, will ya?

109
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,492
- Okay.

110
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:00,330
- Come on, baby
- Hey. Hey.

111
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,832
- You want to dd
- Please. Please, will ya?

112
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,918
My nerves.

113
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:15,887
Hey. Ain't there any other tune
you can almost sing?

114
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,932
You ain't told me your name.

115
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,978
- Joe.
- I used to know a fella named Joe.

116
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,272
He drove a Ford.
Did you ever meet him?

117
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,026
Well, I might've, at that.

118
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,822
No. No.

119
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,700
The guy I knew drove a Chevrolet,
and his name was Fred.

120
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,202
No. Lt couldn't have
been the same guy.

121
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,080
- Oh, you're quite a kidder.
- Yeah, you're pretty fresh yourself.

122
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,124
Just fresh enough.

123
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,044
Say, what makes you such a grouch?

124
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,922
Janes like you.
You work all day in some store...

125
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,842
and then you rush home to sleep
at night in some stuffy tenement.

126
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,636
And you'll be content to do it
for the rest of your life...

127
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,931
because you're just a good-time girl.

128
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,726
This is where you wanna be,
with a lot of saps like that...

129
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,395
yellin' their heads off and thinkin'
they're enjoying themselves.

130
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,314
You ain't got brains
enough to realize...

131
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,608
that now is the time
you oughta be saving your money...

132
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,693
and trying to make something
better of yourself.

133
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,487
- Well, you're here, ain't ya?
- I’m here to get fresh air.

134
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,073
But you notice I ain't spendin'
any dough on you, don't ya?

135
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,117
Not even an ice cream soda.

136
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,578
Say, listen, you big stiff.
If you think I'm worried...

137
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,205
about you buying me an ice cream soda,
you're crazy.

138
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,291
I wouldn't be found dead with ya.

139
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,465
Thanks for bringing me home.
I had a swell time.

140
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,592
Okay.

141
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,011
Well, do you want to see me again?

142
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,013
Oh, I should say not.

143
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,057
But accidents will happen.

144
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,729
Well, I gotta go.

145
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,443
I gotta go upstairs now.

146
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,075
You see, my mother's dead,
and my brother's boss of the house.

147
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,745
He gets sore when I stay out late.
You know, he's careful for me.

148
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,081
But as Edna says,
you can't watch a girl hard enough...

149
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,208
to keep her good
if she don't want to be.

150
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,877
Get 10 cents' worth of potato salad too.

151
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:14,255
Don't bring Limburger.
I don't want the flat all smelled up again.

152
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,299
Oh, I know what to get.

153
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,139
Gee, I wish she wouldn't holler
down the stairs that way.

154
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,141
It don't give the house no class.

155
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,061
My mother always used to
holler down the stairs.

156
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,729
She did?

157
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,148
Yeah.

158
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:36,444
So's my old man. He sold his coat
for a drink and caught pneumonia.

159
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,488
He was a terrible lush.

160
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,536
Gee. My old lady was nice though.

161
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,622
- Hello, Dot.
- Hello, Paula.

162
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,753
Geez. Everything
lives in this house.

163
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,631
Nobody'll speak to her
anymore but me.

164
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,175
Lt makes my brother sore when I do.

165
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,177
But as Edna says,
nobody knows whether a

166
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,513
person's good or bad but
the person themselves.

167
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,057
And they won't tell.

168
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,018
This Edna Jane does most of
your thinking, don't she?

169
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:13,440
Edna's swell. She's got a kid almost seven.
She's a widow.

170
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,237
Jerome 7...

171
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,823
4-7-5-3.

172
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,284
Her mother's been awful sick.

173
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,036
Hello? Esther?

174
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,373
You better come over.

175
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,879
Yes.

176
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,132
Now, Esther...

177
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,760
you gotta control yourself.

178
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,515
9:15.

179
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,895
I had just looked at the clock.

180
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,443
You better stop in at Mr. Levant's.

181
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:06,868
Esther, you gotta get
a hold of yourself.

182
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,078
There's things to be done.

183
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,081
Good-bye.

184
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,013
Your mother, Mrs. Gardner?

185
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,975
- Yes.
- Oh, I’m so sorry for you.

186
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,020
Thanks, Miss Haley.

187
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,027
Still stays hot out, don't it?

188
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,205
Do you want me to
go up with you, ma'am?

189
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,166
Thank you very kindly.

190
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,169
I’m all right.

191
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,924
I'm just a little tired, I guess.

192
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,511
Good night.

193
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,972
- Good night.
- Good night.

194
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:24,070
You know, a tenement house
like this is awful funny.

195
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,366
Here her mother's dead
on the fifth floor.

196
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,493
And only this morning...

197
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,954
on the second floor...

198
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,248
Mrs. Mills had a new baby.

199
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,959
Yeah? Well, she didn't do
that kid no favor.

200
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,420
- What do you mean?
- I mean bringing it into the world...

201
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,755
where she ain't got money enough
to take care of it.

202
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,341
Oh, Joe, that's
a terrible thing to say.

203
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,385
What's the kid
got to look forward to?

204
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,637
Starvin' himself to death
in some tenement.

205
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,016
Born on the second floor and...

206
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,184
probably die on the fifth.

207
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,480
His whole life spent in climbin'
three flights of stairs.

208
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,567
- Oh, Joe, you're terrible hard.
- Yeah?

209
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,320
Well, here's one guy's
gonna beat this game, see?

210
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,072
No poverty, no pinchin',
no scrimpin' for me.

211
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,867
I got $580 saved up, see?

212
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,453
In a couple of months,
I'm gonna have my own radio shop.

213
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:17,248
Yeah. Gee, there are a lot of things
in life besides just money.

214
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,251
Yeah. Sure there's a lot of things
in life beside money.

215
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,545
But you gotta have money
to find them.

216
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,892
Well...

217
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,894
I gotta go now.

218
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,896
My brother will
lay me out in lavender.

219
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,482
I went to Coney Island once
and didn't get in till midnight.

220
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,276
Was he sore.
He hit me in the eye.

221
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,320
- He did?
- Yeah.

222
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,448
- Say, do you want me to go up with you?
- Oh, no.

223
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,742
- That'd only make it worse.
- Yeah?

224
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:56,204
Well, no guy's gonna hit any Jane
I go out with, brother or no brother.

225
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,581
Oh, he just wants to see
that I keep straight.

226
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,918
- But as Edna says-
- Ah, who cares what Edna says?

227
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,671
Well...

228
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,756
I gotta go now.

229
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,467
I told you not to
bring any Limburger cheese in here.

230
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,552
I won't have the flat
all stunk up!

231
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,930
Well, It don't smell after It's eaten.

232
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,563
There's a tenement for ya.

233
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,775
A woman dies, a baby's born...

234
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,319
and a guy's wife
won't let him eat Limburger.

235
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,198
Gee, you're a funny fella, Joe.

236
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:36,202
Ln fact, you're the first guy I ever went
out with that didn't try to get fresh.

237
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,497
Well, I gotta go now.

238
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,961
Say, Joe, you know,
I like you an awful lot.

239
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,175
Okay.

240
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,303
You'll probably be just nutty enough
to call me up at the shop.

241
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,264
The number's Schuyler 4...

242
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,349
6-5-8-3.

243
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:02,228
Four, 65, 83.
That's the way I always remember numbers.

244
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,855
Well, good night.

245
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,024
So long.

246
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,239
Hey. Wait a minute.

247
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,164
My name ain't Joe.

248
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,500
It's Eddie Collins.

249
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,215
Just a moment.
Oh, Eddie.

250
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,677
Oh, Eddie, uh, will you have this gentleman's
set finished by tomorrow morning?

251
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,472
Yes, sir. I'll work on it tonight.
You've got a great set.

252
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,641
- Mmm. Your wife will enjoy that.
- Oh, I haven't any wife.

253
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,684
Oh.

254
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,520
That's why I'm able to
pay $300 for a radio.

255
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,106
Well, there's something to that.
Of course, if

256
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,567
you keep your radio
turned on all the time...

257
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,903
you have the effect
of a wife anyway.

258
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,988
- Yes.
- Oh, that's good.

259
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,491
Ah, you hear?
That fella's got the right idea.

260
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,577
Eddie, now, you take
a lesson from him.

261
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,704
Don't get married.

262
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,873
Not a Chinaman's chance.

263
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,542
He's been getting a lot of telephone
calls lately, Mr. Lathrop.

264
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,460
Ah.

265
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,004
Well, I'd hate to see you
making any mistake, Eddie.

266
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,007
Why, you can have your own
little place in six months.

267
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,967
But not if you let a
woman get a hold on ya.

268
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:15,635
Oh.

269
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,346
I never even think about it.

270
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:23,643
That's the danger. Do you suppose any man
would ever marry if he thought of it?

271
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,104
Why, I can't even talk to a girl.

272
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,565
You know, it's funny
about me that way.

273
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,567
I’d like to be nice to women.

274
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,821
You know, say nice things to them,
like fellas can.

275
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:38,157
I can't though.
I think of nice things to say.

276
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,618
But when it comes to
putting 'em into words-

277
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,703
I only say something
sarcastic and mean.

278
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,831
- Hello?
- But me get married?

279
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:48,459
- That's a laugh.
- Well, I hope so.

280
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,712
Yeah. Hey, Sheik.

281
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,010
Hello?

282
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,062
Hello, stupid.

283
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,148
How are ya?

284
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,191
Sure, it's me.

285
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,820
Yeah. The same place.

286
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,322
In front of Loft's candy store.

287
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:23,286
Listen, unconscious.
Be on time.

288
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:28,040
I ain't waitin' for any dizzy Janes
on a street corner, see?

289
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,334
Yeah.

290
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,421
7:30.

291
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,552
Okay.

292
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,848
Uh-uh.

293
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,975
Oh-

294
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,092
Waiting for me, baby?

295
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,553
I'm waiting for my husband.
He's the cop on this beat.

296
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,554
Excuse me.

297
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,195
Yeah.

298
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:44,492
- I was just going.
- Well, ain't that swell.

299
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,954
Say, you got a lot of nerve letting me
stand out there in the pouring rain.

300
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,415
Gee, I didn't know it was so late.
I got to foolin' around with this thing.

301
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,253
Ain't it a pip?
It'll bring in anything from KGO to L20.

302
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,213
- No kidding.
- Yeah. Sweet job, huh?

303
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,548
Come here, and I'll show you
what I had to do with it.

304
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,051
What do I care what you had to
do with it? I’m not Marconi...

305
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,095
or Edison or whoever
invented the thing.

306
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,014
- I'm standing out there-
- All right. My mistake.

307
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,976
Radio's my job.

308
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,144
I'm gonna have my own store soon.

309
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,189
- I thought you were interested in my work.
- I am interested, Eddie.

310
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,567
But, gee, I got a right to be sore,
standing out in the rain like that.

311
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,153
Well, after all,
you can't saw sawdust.

312
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:24,073
What kind of a crack is that?
"You can't saw sawdust."

313
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,200
I mean it's done.

314
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,578
All I can do is say that I’m sorry.

315
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:35,251
- Do you forgive me?
- Well, I got a right to be sore.

316
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,253
All right. You're sore.
What are you kicking about?

317
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,255
- Well, I got a right.
- All right.

318
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,549
- Well?
- Well?

319
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,552
Aw, come on.
Say you forgive me.

320
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,263
Aw, come on. Come on.

321
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,390
Come on. Say it.

322
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,393
Come on. Come on.

323
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,771
Okay.
How'd you ever find the place?

324
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,441
I remember you said it was
on the third floor in the front.

325
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,568
Come on. Take your coat off
and stay a while.

326
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,570
Oh, no, Eddie.
Let's go to a movie, huh?

327
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,822
Ah, look. It's raining
cats and dogs out.

328
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,742
- Well, I can't stay here.
- What's the matter with this?

329
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:11,871
My brother would rip me apart if he knew
I was alone with a fella in his room.

330
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:15,124
Suppose your landlady found me. Gee,
she'd think I was a tramp or something.

331
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,376
Ah, they don't expect
nothing raw here.

332
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,212
This ain't no $12-a-day hotel.

333
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,214
Ah, let's wait downstairs then.

334
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:26,135
Lt might rain for an hour yet. Let's stay
here where they have ashtrays and things.

335
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:30,431
I gotta go. Besides, it ain't right,
my being alone here in the room with you.

336
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,225
- Did I ever get fresh with ya?
- No.

337
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,103
But I ain't that kind of a girl.
I don't go to fellas' rooms.

338
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,064
Listen. I got other things
to think about, see?

339
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:41,692
I’m gonna have my own store soon. I was
talking to the boss about it only today.

340
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,778
Oh, gee, Eddie.
That'll be swell.

341
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,030
None of that mushy stuff for me.

342
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,743
- Give us a kiss, will ya?
- Oh. None of that mushy stuff, huh?

343
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,745
Ah, well, a little
of it's all right.

344
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,789
Come on. Take off your
coat and stay a while.

345
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,040
Oh, no. I can't. Oh, no.

346
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,501
- Eddie, now-
- Come on. Take it off. Come on.

347
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,586
- Take that hat off.
- Stay-Oh, no.

348
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,713
- Eddie, I’m not gonna take my hat off.
- Come on.

349
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,673
- Oh, now you're-
- Take it off.

350
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,593
No.

351
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,495
Oh, gee. I didn't know
it was as late as that.

352
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,664
- Ah, it's early yet.
- Well, I gotta go.

353
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,126
Stopped raining.

354
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:44,630
Hey, look it. There's a fella
trying to kiss a girl.

355
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,258
Where?

356
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,927
- Here.
- Oh, Eddie.

357
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,305
Oh, Eddie, please don't.
I gotta go.

358
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,307
Aw, gee.

359
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:59,562
You can't be with me two minutes
but you gotta pull that "I gotta go" gag.

360
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,856
Aw, no. But you don't understand.
I must go.

361
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,858
You'd think I was
poison or something.

362
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,611
Oh, no, but it's getting late,
and I can't stay any longer.

363
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,196
I know. You gotta go.

364
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,409
Aw, Eddie. Don't get mad.

365
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:17,997
I’m not mad. But you're always
talking about "I gotta go."

366
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,249
Well, I do have to go.

367
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,684
It's only about 4:00.

368
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:42,354
Yeah, but I've never been out
later than 12:00 in my life.

369
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:46,358
Oh, my brother will kill me.

370
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,237
Aw, gee, kid.
Please don't do that.

371
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,073
If I could only find Edna.

372
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:57,453
Aw, can't you do anything
without Edna's help?

373
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,538
My brother's stuck on her.

374
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,790
If she was there,
he wouldn't be sore at me.

375
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,792
At least he wouldn't holler.

376
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,170
He's got a terrible temper.

377
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:09,256
Well, you want to go over
and try Edna's house again?

378
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,760
No. If she was there,
she'd open the door.

379
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,970
She must be sleeping at her aunt's.

380
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:20,100
- Come on.
- What are you gonna do?

381
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,436
I’m goin' up and tell your brother
you were with me.

382
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,980
No. You can't go up.
There'd only be a fight.

383
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,982
Aw, there wouldn't be any fight.

384
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:30,611
He'd make one crack, I’d hang that in his
jaw, and the fight would be all over.

385
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,657
Oh, gee, Eddie.

386
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,201
I like you a terrible lot.

387
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:43,082
- Okay.
- Oh, don't just say...

388
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:46,710
- "Okay."
- Aw, gee, kid.

389
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,171
I ain't much, and...

390
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,215
well, you-you know...

391
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,342
words don't seem to-

392
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:58,222
- Aw, what are you bawling for?
- Oh, Eddie.

393
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,517
Aw, gee, kid.

394
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,602
I'm sorry.

395
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,729
It's all my fault.

396
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:28,669
Me staying out till 4:00 in the morning.
What'll I do?

397
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,049
I tell ya. You can say we were
gonna get married.

398
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,178
- Oh, he'd find out we weren't.
- How?

399
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,306
When we didn't.

400
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,559
Well, we would.

401
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,814
- We would?
- Would ya?

402
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,193
You mean you're-
you're asking me to marry you?

403
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,237
Yeah.

404
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,198
Oh. Oh, sure I will, Eddie.

405
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,159
Okay.

406
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:05,080
I'll love to marry you, Eddie. You'll never
be sorry or anything, honest you won't.

407
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,876
But I never thought you meant
we'd really get married.

408
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,169
Neither did I.

409
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,591
Oh, well, Eddie, if you
want to back out, I won't-

410
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,467
Oh.

411
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,302
So you want to make an
argument out of it, huh?

412
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:18,969
No.

413
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,722
Listen. I never back out ever, see?

414
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,808
And let me tell you something. You ain't
puttin' nothin' over on me neither.

415
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,935
- I don't-
- Not a thing. If I didn't think...

416
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,230
you were the swellest Jane in the world,
I never would have given you a tumble.

417
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,274
For me, nothing but the best, see?

418
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,402
So if you've got any idea
in your nut that I'm the kind of guy...

419
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,613
runs around asking any Jane
to marry him, you're crazy.

420
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:42,201
Oh, gee, Eddie, you're a scream.

421
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:46,163
Why, you can-you can even make a fight
out of a proposal of marriage.

422
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,165
But you ain't kiddin' me.

423
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,167
You try to make out
you're hard-boiled...

424
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,169
but you're not really.

425
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:55,172
Why, you've got a heart as big as anything.

426
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:58,175
- And you're square too.
- Hooey.

427
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,761
The kind of a fella
a girl can depend on.

428
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,265
I was in love with you
almost the first time we met.

429
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:10,979
Oh, you're fine and decent
and tenderhearted.

430
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:16,985
Oh, Eddie. You're just the sweetest guy
in all the world.

431
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,281
- Okay.
- And we can be happy.

432
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,283
Lots of people
are married and happy.

433
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,619
I'm sick and tired of it.

434
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,414
while you stay out till
4:00 In the morning-

435
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:31,500
I said enough Is enough! Get out, you pig!

436
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,045
That'll never happen to us.

437
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,006
- I should say not.
- Well?

438
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,220
- Do you want me to go up with you?
- No.

439
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,222
I'm not afraid now.

440
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:50,060
I’m not afraid of anything now.

441
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,646
You know...

442
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,732
it's sort of like
not being alone anymore.

443
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,569
Yeah. Lt is like that, ain't it?

444
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,571
When'll we be married?

445
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,323
In the morning.
And I’ll take the day off.

446
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,326
Say...

447
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,412
I’m kind of happy about it.

448
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,498
Well, what do you know about that?

449
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,625
Oh, Eddie.

450
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,309
Good night, kid.

451
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,022
Good night, darling.

452
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,947
- Eddie.
- What?

453
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,074
Husband.

454
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,286
Okay.

455
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,877
Hey, cab.

456
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,517
Hello, Edna.

457
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,477
What are you doing here?

458
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,814
Jim come over to my house about
an hour ago to see if you were there.

459
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,399
He was worried about you,
so I came back here with him.

460
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,693
I, um-I couldn't remember
the name of that hospital...

461
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,821
you said you were going to
to visit that girl.

462
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:27,616
She must be worse, huh?
Your staying there until almost 4:00.

463
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,911
You mean well, Edna,
but that's a lot of hooey.

464
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,455
- Where were ya?
- Where do you think, Edna?

465
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,874
- I'm gonna get married.
- No.

466
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,587
So, it's as bad as that, huh?

467
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,631
What do you mean
it's as bad as that?

468
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,341
I thought girls brought
their fellas around

469
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,093
and showed them off first
to their families.

470
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,470
They do in families where
they ain't treated like prisoners.

471
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:51,890
Yeah? Well, not that you'd have
brains enough to know it...

472
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,643
but I’ve been a pretty good
brother to you, see?

473
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,188
I've been a father and a mother to ya.
I’m supporting this house.

474
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,899
And you've got some nerve
comin' in at 4:00 in the morning...

475
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,943
tellin' me that
you're gonna get married.

476
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,028
Why do you object?
You don't even know the fella.

477
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,197
No, but I'm going to.

478
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:11,076
Bring him around. Let him meet your family,
like any decent fella would want to do.

479
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,079
And after a while,
if I think he's all right...

480
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,081
you can marry him.

481
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:20,210
- After a while?
- Oh, that gets a rise out of you, does it?

482
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,922
I thought it would.
One of them rush marriages.

483
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,425
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

484
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:29,803
- You don't know that I did anything wrong.
- I can put two and two together.

485
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:33,432
- Oh, Jim, you're rotten.
- You can prove that you're not.

486
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:36,810
You tell me that you'll wait, or I'll know
that you gotta marry this guy.

487
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:40,105
And if that's the case,
I don't want you in the house.

488
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,399
- Now, what do you think about that?
- Where'll I go?

489
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:45,235
Go back where you come from,
you little tramp.

490
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,071
And get out now.
You won't take any clothes with you either.

491
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,908
I paid for every rag
you got on your back.

492
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,201
Go on. Get out.

493
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,245
You deserve everything
you're gettin'.

494
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,624
Sure does.

495
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,877
A girl brought up under the influence
of a fine brother like you got.

496
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,380
You'll probably end up in the streets. That's
what you got in your mind, ain't it, Jim?

497
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,424
And I won't be sorry for her either.

498
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:11,386
No, I don't expect you to be sorry for
her, Jim. But let her have her clothes.

499
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,848
- I paid for 'em.
- Yeah, but don't be cheap.

500
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,434
Let her find out there
ain't another man who'll

501
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,645
treat her as white as
her own brother did.

502
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,898
Go on.
Let her have her clothes.

503
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,609
All right. Get 'em, and get out.

504
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,433
Hey, Dot.

505
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,186
Hey.

506
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,438
- Where you goin'?
- With the kid, you big bully.

507
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,440
You called her a tramp, didn't ya?

508
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:09,528
Just because she stayed out until 4:00 in
the morning and you suspect where she was.

509
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:12,656
Well, I stayed out until 4:00 in the
morning, and you knew where I was.

510
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,117
So I got a pretty good idea
what you think of me.

511
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,119
I'll see you in the cemetery.
Go on, Dot.

512
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,168
Wake up, Dotty. Wake up.

513
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,170
Hello, Floyd.

514
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:31,258
Ma just hollered
across the air shaft...

515
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:35,345
and said that she was
makin' breakfast for a new bride.

516
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,389
Are you a new bride?

517
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,933
Yes, darling.
I'm going to be today.

518
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:43,687
- What's an old one?
- Oh, you monkey, you.

519
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,648
Come on. Run along and play now.

520
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,193
Aw, I wanna see Dotty
get out of bed.

521
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,279
You get out of here.

522
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:55,699
I wanna see Dotty get out of bed.

523
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,701
And at his age.

524
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,745
- What time is it?
- Almost 1 1 :00.

525
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,955
I phoned the store and
said we were both sick.

526
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,081
Has Eddie come yet?

527
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,083
- Nope.
- He hasn't?

528
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,003
- Not yet.
- I wonder why he doesn't come.

529
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,132
Maybe it's 'cause he
doesn't know I'm here.

530
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,633
That'd be a good reason.

531
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,635
He certainly wouldn't
come to see me.

532
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,637
Oh, he doesn't
really dislike you, Edna.

533
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,308
No, not dislike.
He hates me.

534
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:25,520
And it isn't just an average, everyday,
amateur kind of hatred either.

535
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,648
I'll bet that guy spends hours
practicing hating me.

536
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,359
Aw, that's just his way.
You know, he's kind of funny.

537
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,653
That would be great.
He'll hand you a lot of laughs.

538
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:37,532
Oh, gee, Edna, it was swell the way
you came through for me last night.

539
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:41,078
- I’m awful grateful to ya.
- And I’m grateful to Jim.

540
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,288
- He saved my life.
- How?

541
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,124
Just suppose he didn't turn out
to be a heel last night.

542
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,753
I’d have been married to him in three
months, and after being nicely cemented...

543
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,464
with a wedding ring,
the church service and everything...

544
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:55,342
I’d have found out
what he really is.

545
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,762
Yes, sir.
He saved my life-

546
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,765
'cause they send you to the chair
these days for killing your husband.

547
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,902
In the name of goodness,
what are you doing?

548
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,238
- I'm trying something, but it won't work.
- What won't?

549
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,741
I put some black ink
in the white milk...

550
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,035
and the white milk turned black.

551
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,039
But when I put the white milk in the
black ink, the black won't turn white.

552
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,084
Put that ink away
and clean up that mess.

553
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:32,879
- Ali right.
- Oh, Edna, what time Is It now?

554
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,840
It's a little after 1 1 :00.

555
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,467
- Where'd you put my stockings?
- Why, I put 'em, uh-

556
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,637
Is this Mrs. Cook's boardinghouse?

557
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,390
Well, is Mr. Collins there?

558
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,184
Collins. Eddie Collins.

559
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,397
He what?

560
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,399
He moved away?

561
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,318
Well-Well, he lived
there last night.

562
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,949
He moved away
this morning? Well-

563
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,243
Well, did he say
where he was moving to?

564
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,999
What's the matter?

565
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,294
- He's walked out on me.
- Don't be a goof.

566
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,379
He has.

567
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,882
Oh.

568
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,925
I wish I was dead.

569
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,219
We all get that wish someday.

570
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,305
Call up his store.
Do you know the number?

571
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:29,978
Schuyler 4-6583.

572
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,981
And hurry it up, deary.
There's a fire.

573
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,025
Here.

574
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,068
Hello?

575
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,739
Hello, Lathrop Radio Shop?

576
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:43,867
Well, can I speak
to Mr. Collins, please?

577
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,869
Eddie Collins.

578
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:49,122
Never mind the wisecracks.
He's there, I wanna speak to him.

579
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,875
This is the girl he's engaged
to be married to.

580
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:55,003
Fresh guy trying to flirt with me.

581
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,505
He what?

582
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,674
He was fired?

583
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,760
What for?

584
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,765
He said he was fired
for robbin' the cash register.

585
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,767
Well, you're all right then.

586
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,645
If he's lost his job, it's a cinch
he'll be here to marry ya.

587
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,564
I can't tell whether the
fella was kiddin' or not.

588
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,817
There he is now. See?
All of your troubles for nothing.

589
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,070
Oh, gee, and I’m not
dressed or anything.

590
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,197
Oh, give me those stockings.

591
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,957
I don't wanna subscribe
to any magazines.

592
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,793
I don't care if you're working your way
through the penitentiary.

593
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,799
- Was that him, Edna?
- No. A book agent.

594
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,884
Oh.

595
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,304
What am I gonna do?

596
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,306
Now, stop worrying.

597
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,977
If Eddie is only half the guy
I think he is, he won't let you down.

598
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:55,772
That's the trouble with us women.
If we'd only realize that-

599
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,859
Something's burning.

600
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,862
Oh, what are you doing now?

601
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,783
- I’m cookin' it for ya.
- A whole pound of butter.

602
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,786
I told you a piece of butter,
not a pound of butter.

603
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,122
A pound's a piece.

604
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,131
I'll go, Edna.

605
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:27,846
Oh, darling,
you're driving me crazy.

606
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:31,141
Get out into the hall. You've done
all the damage in here that you can.

607
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,226
See if you can ruin the wallpaper.

608
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:37,022
- Shall I do it with a knife?
- Get out of here!

609
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:44,237
- Wasn't him, huh?
- No. A man selling-

610
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,073
For goodness' sake,
take that long face off.

611
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,534
This is your wedding day,
not your funeral.

612
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,329
He'll be here.
There's a mistake somewhere. That's all.

613
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,832
Yeah, last night-
that was the mistake.

614
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,086
Don't be silly.
He'll be here.

615
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,213
Oh, but I love him so much.

616
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:05,467
Well, you can still love him and have a cup
of coffee in your stomach too.

617
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:09,596
I don't want any coffee.
I never want to eat anything again.

618
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,307
- Fine. Then have a glass of milk.
- I don't want any milk.

619
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,893
Oh, come on. Have a glass of milk.
It'll do you good.

620
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,854
You know, the first thing
that you have to learn is-

621
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,238
I’m getting hysterical.

622
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,542
Open the door, Floyd.

623
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:43,338
And if it's a man selling coffins,
tell him we'll take two.

624
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,518
Who's dead?

625
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,603
Oh, Eddie!

626
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,064
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

627
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:04,275
Say, listen.
You're going to be a married man.

628
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,987
The first thing you have to learn is to
get accustomed to your wife's tears.

629
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,490
I was over to your house,
and they said you wasn't there.

630
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,492
So I took a chance and come here.

631
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,495
I called up your house,
and your landlady said that you'd moved.

632
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,497
I got a bigger room
across the street.

633
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:21,501
My landlady was sore. That's why
she wouldn't tell you where I went.

634
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,462
And they said at the store that
you'd been bounced for stealing.

635
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,798
They were kiddin' ya.

636
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,509
Oh, Eddie, I'm so happy.

637
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,637
- Okay.
- Now maybe you can eat some breakfast.

638
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,931
We'll eat downtown.
We gotta get goin'.

639
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,517
Go get your things.

640
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,103
Her master's voice.

641
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,355
- Do you know how to get there?
- I'll find out.

642
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,482
- I'll tell ya. You take
the subway to City Hall.

643
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,150
- Yeah?

644
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:49,946
When you get out of the train, you walk
straight ahead and turn to the right.

645
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,657
There are two exits there.
You take the one to the left. Understand?

646
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,951
- Yeah.
- Then when you get up on the street...

647
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,662
- you walk straight ahead-
- I'm gonna take a cab.

648
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,374
I'll tell you which cab to take.

649
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,960
Hey. Whose wedding
is this, yours or mine?

650
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,962
Oh, Edna's just trying
to help us, Eddie.

651
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,673
You wasn't on the other side
when they had the war, were ya?

652
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,632
No. What's the answer?

653
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:12,135
I was wondering how they
ever got along without you.

654
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:15,305
I phoned my orders over.

655
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,432
Won't you come down
and see us get married?

656
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:20,435
No.
I hate those things-

657
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,855
deaths and funerals and things like that.

658
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,899
Oh, gee, Edna.

659
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,735
I can never thank you enough
for all you've done for me.

660
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,070
Oh, that's all right, kid.

661
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,740
I only hope you're
gonna be awful happy.

662
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,826
If she ain't, you'll hear from me,
you big stiff.

663
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,205
Okay.

664
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,207
- Good luck.
- So long.

665
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,834
Good-bye.

666
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,171
Oh, darling!

667
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,179
Night, now.

668
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,063
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

669
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,817
- What's this?
- Oh. Just a couple of hunks of candy.

670
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,819
Oh, gee, Eddie.

671
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,614
- You know why?
- Sure. Because you love me, don't ya?

672
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,574
Ah-

673
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,826
- Oh, say it.
- What?

674
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,454
Say "I love you, darling."

675
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,916
Right out in all the light?

676
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,961
- Oh, Eddie.
- This is our anniversary.

677
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,963
Ten weeks ago today we got hitched.

678
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,507
Aw, gee, it was sweet of you
to bring me the candy.

679
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,176
And I got news for ya.
I found a store.

680
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,262
The boss is gonna lend me
a hundred bucks...

681
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,223
and with the 650 I got saved up,
I can swing the deal.

682
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,767
He'll let me have
all the radios I want on time.

683
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,520
- What do you know about that, huh?
- That'll be swell.

684
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:50,233
Of course, we may have to
pinch nickels for a while but...

685
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:53,152
in the end, it'll all be Jake.

686
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,989
- Gee whiz, I’m a happy guy.
- Are you, Eddie?

687
00:42:56,073 --> 00:43:00,368
Yeah. I been thinkin' about having
my own store for over two years now.

688
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:05,123
And while I ain't much
on tossin' this baloney...

689
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:08,001
and all that mush stuff...

690
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,296
a guy could have
a worse wife than you.

691
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,424
- Ya little squirt.
- Oh, Eddie.

692
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,554
- I love you so, darling.
- Okay.

693
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:24,183
Hey. Put your hat and coat on, and I'll
take you over and show you the place.

694
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,227
- Oh, I can't now.
- Why not?

695
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,980
I’m waitin' for Edna.
She phoned she'll be up in a little while.

696
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,189
Ah, what does she want?

697
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,900
Well, I wanted to ask her
advice about something.

698
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,986
- About what?
- About-

699
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,574
Well, about the store,
see what she thinks of it.

700
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:42,452
Oh, gee. It'll be tough
if she don't like it.

701
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:46,289
Oh, Eddie, that's not a nice thing to say.

702
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:49,584
Here she is. Now, please don't
be mean to her. Come in.

703
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,671
- Hello, Dot.
- Hi, Edna.

704
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,715
How's the grouch?

705
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,759
I thought they sent you
down to Washington...

706
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,303
so you could tell the president
how to run the country.

707
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,680
Ooh. They sent
the president up to see me.

708
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,352
Oh, don't mind him, Edna.

709
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,854
- He's happy as the devil today.
- Yeah, he looks it.

710
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:12,231
- He's gonna open his own store soon.
- Hmm!

711
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,317
I heard Wanamaker's
were going out of business.

712
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,403
They probably figured the competition
would be too much for 'em.

713
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,283
I’m going down to the corner
and get a paper.

714
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,746
Come on. Sit down.

715
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,873
I've got so much to tell you.

716
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:32,168
- Still in love with him?
- Oh, I’m just crazy about him.

717
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:37,382
Edna, I'm going to have a baby.

718
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,592
Oh, Dot.

719
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,594
- I’m afraid.
- Oh, don't be silly.

720
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:45,848
- My mother had eight of' em.
- Yeah. My mother died having me.

721
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:48,476
Yes, but things are different now.

722
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,396
You know, the hospitals are better,
and the doctors and things.

723
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,398
No girl minds it anymore.

724
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,400
- What does Eddie say?
- He doesn't know.

725
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,402
Well, why don't you tell him?

726
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,862
Well, his heart's so set
on having that store.

727
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,906
It'll take every nickel he's got.

728
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,492
Oh, I don't know what to do.

729
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,619
Edna, I'm so worried. You
know, if the store's

730
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,663
gonna make Eddie happy,
I want him to have it.

731
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:09,580
Sure.

732
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,125
When I think of what
happened to my mother-

733
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,503
Unless I had everything
of the best-

734
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,630
you know, the best doctors
and everything-

735
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,550
- I’d be frightened.
- You poor kid.

736
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,677
Now listen.

737
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,804
This fella you're
married to is all right.

738
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,557
He's 100%. I know what's
the matter with him.

739
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,726
He's one of those sensitive eggs.

740
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:33,521
Of course, he may not like me, but what the
heck. Napoleon had a couple of enemies too.

741
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,274
Now you tell Eddie tonight.

742
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,317
And if I know anything about men...

743
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,070
he'll be stopping strangers on the street
tomorrow, bragging about it.

744
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,781
- Do you really think so?
- Oh, sure. All men are alike.

745
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,825
They puff themselves up.

746
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,035
You'd think they'd done something.

747
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,122
- Oh, I hope he'll really be like that.
- He will be.

748
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:54,792
I don't know though. He's always
yelling about living in a tenement...

749
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:58,337
and what a sin it is to have children
if you can't afford to give 'em everything.

750
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,966
I don't think I read anything in the papers
about him being born in the White House.

751
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,886
He was awful poor.
That's why he thinks like that about it.

752
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,722
Here he is.
Don't say anything.

753
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,101
- You still here?
- No.

754
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,188
Did you get your paper, Eddie?

755
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,315
I got down there,
and I didn't have any change.

756
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:20,610
You can get one next week. They'll have
a dozen new murders for you by then.

757
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:23,196
Here, let me fix that tie.

758
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,990
- It looks like a unbent pretzel.
- The tie is-

759
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,284
You only wear it.
Other people have to look at it.

760
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:31,037
I don't know how you ever
picked this Jane out for a friend.

761
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,998
- She's the dizziest dame I ever seen.
- Hold up your chin.

762
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,506
Look what I got, Eddie.

763
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:45,218
Look what I got! Look what I got!

764
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:48,846
- Where'd you get all this stuff?
- Eddie give us 60 cents to buy it.

765
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,265
Aw, he's crazy.

766
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,810
It was-Sixty-

767
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,312
Oh, what did you wanna
come up here for anyway?

768
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,356
Go on outside and play. Go on.

769
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,233
Go on.

770
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,984
Go on now.
Get out of here.

771
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,529
Thanks a lot, Eddie!

772
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:07,532
Gimme a slice of that cone down there.

773
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,325
Poor kids.

774
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,578
I found 'em downstairs in that dark hallway
tryin' to play games.

775
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,330
They ain't got a chance in life.

776
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,999
Eddie, did you give him
the 60 cents?

777
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,001
Listen, I got better things
to do with my money...

778
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:21,045
than throw it away on a lot of kids.

779
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:26,175
Say, you're a swell egg.

780
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,181
What are you gonna sell
in your radio store?

781
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:35,560
Never mind. The way you run
people's business for them...

782
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:38,437
if you start buttin' in, I'll probably
end up ownin' a butcher shop.

783
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,815
Well, I’m going.

784
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:45,444
- Remember now. Tell him.
- Tell him what?

785
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,738
Oh, nothing, Eddie.

786
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,740
She's got a secret for ya.

787
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:53,119
Oh, she's got a secret for me,
but you know it.

788
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,621
Geez, you're runnin' my house
for me, too, I see.

789
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,040
- Sure. Bye, darlin'.
- See you tomorrow.

790
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,543
- Bye, grouch.
- So long, dizzy.

791
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,380
What's the big secret?

792
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:07,508
I don't know whether
you'll like it or not.

793
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,510
Hey, listen, kid.

794
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:12,096
I'm so happy about the store,
I'd like anything.

795
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,017
Oh.

796
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,191
Well? What is it?

797
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,403
Eddie, I'm going back to work.

798
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,405
- Back to work?
- Yeah.

799
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:32,283
Hey, listen. No wife of mine
is goin' to work.

800
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,242
What'd be the harm?

801
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,870
I'll do all the work that's
to be done in this family.

802
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:41,125
- What do you wanna go to work for?
- Well-

803
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,086
Well, it gets kind of lonesome
stayin' here all day all alone.

804
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,088
Can't you go to picture shows
and things?

805
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,840
You just said
we'd have to pinch nickels.

806
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:50,343
Yeah, but I didn't mean
we'd have to pinch 'em that hard.

807
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,851
You don't like livin' in just one room.
ls that it?

808
00:48:58,852 --> 00:48:59,977
Oh, it's all right.

809
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:04,523
But I wish we had a flat of our own or
something-you know, our own furniture.

810
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,818
Can't you see, Eddie? If I went to work,
you could have your store just the same.

811
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,737
And with the money I make,
we could-

812
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:12,156
Do you think I'd take money
you worked for?

813
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,951
- Oh, it'd be all right.
- Not with me, it wouldn't.

814
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:18,412
My idea of a husband is a guy that looks
after his wife and takes care of her...

815
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,790
and sees that
she don't want for nothin'.

816
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:24,251
If I can't do that,
I won't be a husband.

817
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,588
Me take your money-
you work all day-

818
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:30,800
or let you use it for something
that I ought to be payin' for.

819
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:34,804
Listen. They got a name
for guys like that.

820
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,514
Oh, Eddie, I didn't mean
to make you sore.

821
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:39,350
I ain't sore.

822
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:42,436
But I ain't as happy as I was.
You can lay that on a line.

823
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:47,400
It was our 10 weeks anniversary.

824
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,694
And I had the store
all picked out and everything.

825
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:53,531
And, say, when I come in here tonight,
I was walkin' on air.

826
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:58,202
This kinda crumbs it all up.

827
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:00,830
Gee, I didn't know
you wasn't satisfied.

828
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:04,542
Oh, Eddie, I am satisfied.
It's all right.

829
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:07,169
Let's not talk about it.

830
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:09,422
I'll bet that Edna Jane
put that idea in your nut.

831
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,339
No, she didn't.

832
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:13,300
Let's not say any more about it.

833
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:16,637
You're crazy to have the store,
and it'll make you happy.

834
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,724
Well, that's all I care about-
making you happy.

835
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:24,145
Listen. I'm the husband,
and it's my job to make you happy.

836
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,355
If a husband ain't for that,
he ain't for nothin'.

837
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:32,194
Gee, I told the real estate guy
I’d meet him tonight.

838
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,906
I can't make up my mind
about that sign.

839
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:39,326
Eddie Collins " or Edward Collins"?

840
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:43,706
Course, Eddie Collins" is all right
for a saloon or somethin' like that.

841
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:47,710
Nope, it ain't got class enough
for a radio store.

842
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,712
I'll be back in 15 or 20 minutes.

843
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,926
And I still think that Edna Jane
put that idea in your nut.

844
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,618
I was afraid you wasn't comin'.

845
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,745
What's the idea of phonin' me
to meet you here?

846
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,914
- Dot and me are movin' here.
- You're movin' here?

847
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,957
Sure. I got new furniture
and everything.

848
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,959
That's why I asked you to come.

849
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,754
I thought maybe you'd help me
put 'em in the right places.

850
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:35,508
You'd be buttin' in anyway, so I figured out
you might as well do it in the beginning.

851
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,802
You're moving here?

852
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:40,387
Yeah. Dot told me that secret.

853
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,890
What's that got to do with your moving
and spending your money?

854
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,809
She wanted to go to work.

855
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:48,479
- You mean that's the secret she told you?
- Yeah.

856
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:51,190
So I put two and two together
and figured out why.

857
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:54,360
She wanted a home
with nice furnishings and things.

858
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:57,822
- Say, how much did all this cost you?
- I shot the bankroll.

859
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,698
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

860
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,119
- All you'd saved?
- Sure. This is a swell joint.

861
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,079
The furniture man is takin' charge.

862
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,456
I bought everything new-
from soup to nuts.

863
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,291
When it's finished,
it'll look just like a

864
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:11,460
home that somebody's lived
in for a long time.

865
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,921
Some surprise for the kid, huh?

866
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,673
Yeah, but what about your store?

867
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:18,926
Well, I figured, why let her
starve to death...

868
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,928
while I'm tryin'
to build up a business?

869
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,930
I might've made a flop
of the store anyhow.

870
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:25,224
Not that I would've.
I'd have made a success of it.

871
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,226
Don't get that idea in your nut.

872
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,186
And you spent all your savings?

873
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:32,189
Sure. She's worth it.
She's a great kid.

874
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,692
You'll have me crying
in a minute, Eddie.

875
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:35,985
What for?

876
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:38,863
You wouldn't know.

877
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:42,158
Come on. You never saw anything
sweller than that parlor set I bought.

878
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,201
Come on.
Wait till you get a load of the bedroom.

879
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,121
It's got sheets and pillowcases
and beds and everything in it.

880
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,290
And the kitchen-
We got a lot of pots and pans.

881
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:51,584
It's gonna be like a party.

882
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:55,045
See, I'm gonna tell Dot that Pat and Sue
have got a new flat...

883
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,464
and are havin' a housewarming
and we're invited.

884
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:00,009
I asked a lot of the gang,
and they're in on it too.

885
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:03,304
It's gonna be like, you know,
one of those surprise parties.

886
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,264
And the big payoff
comes when I say...

887
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:08,267
"Well, kid, how do you like
your new home?"

888
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:11,187
What do you think of the idea?

889
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:15,316
- I don't know.
- You didn't think it up. That's why.

890
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:21,155
Hey, wait a minute. Don't put that
great big chair over there by the divan.

891
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,281
That's where the chair belongs.

892
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,033
No, it isn't. It belongs
over on this side.

893
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:25,993
Haven't you got
any sense of balance?

894
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:28,621
- You would get your mouth in it
some way or another.

895
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,295
Hey, hey. Wait until they get here.

896
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,797
Aw, have a heart.
I haven't had any supper.

897
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,841
And don't drink up all the punch.

898
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,093
Here they are.

899
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:46,555
Listen, Pat. Remember, this is supposed
to be your home. You're the host.

900
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,600
- Right. I'll take off my coat and collar.
- That ain't funny.

901
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,852
- It always gets a laugh.
- You open the door. Go on.

902
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,480
I didn't even know that Pat
had moved from 92nd Street.

903
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:56,649
Sure. They got a swell place here.

904
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,777
- Hello, Dot. How are you?
- Hello, Sue.

905
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:02,071
- Hello, Eddie.
- I didn't know that you'd moved.

906
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,198
Oh, I've been here a week.
Come in.

907
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,371
Hi, everybody.

908
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:13,499
- Hello, Chad. How are you?
- Hello, Dot.

909
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:16,293
- Hello, Pat. How are you?
- Let me take your coat.

910
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,212
- Have a schnapps.
- Oh, no, thanks.

911
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,881
Oh, gee, Sue, this is swell.

912
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:23,425
Pat must have murdered
a millionaire or something.

913
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,636
Hey, you ain't seen nothin' yet.

914
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,763
Come on out here
and I'll show you the kitchen.

915
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,515
You'd think this was his house.

916
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,600
Come on. Let's eat.

917
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,560
A closet, and it's got
glass in it too.

918
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,562
And a sink and a washtub.

919
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,606
And look at these things
over here-canisters.

920
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,150
That's where you keep your salt
and pepper and spices and things.

921
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,902
In the one marked "Salt,"
you keep the salt.

922
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,779
Ln the one marked "Pepper,"
you keep the pepper.

923
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,115
Gee, Eddie, ain't it swell?

924
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,450
Look at that darling table.

925
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,619
The guy said it was
the breakfast nook.

926
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:54,748
Oh, Eddie, you think
we'll ever have a place like this?

927
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:59,336
- Would you like to live here, kid?
- Oh, gee, would I?

928
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,880
- Of course, we couldn't afford-
- Why not?

929
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:05,509
Well, we couldn't afford
the money now.

930
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,678
Well, why now?

931
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:12,099
- Well, you wanna get your store first.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's right.

932
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,102
Say, wait till you get a load
of the bedroom. Come on!

933
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:20,691
Say, if Eddie can get Dot a home like this,
why can't you get me one?

934
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:23,360
I thought that'd crop up.

935
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:28,532
- Look at this.
- Oh, this is swell.

936
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:31,076
Listen, kid.
There's a bed.

937
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,290
You can't buy a better bed
than that-65 bucks.

938
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,959
- But how did you-
- Oh, Pat told me.

939
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:42,087
Come on. Feel it.
Just feel it.

940
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:46,300
Ain't this a bed?
Not like that old egg crate we sleep in.

941
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,302
I’ve never seen you so enthusiastic.

942
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,429
The house has sure
made a hit with you.

943
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:52,723
Come on. Now I’m gonna
show you somethin'.

944
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:07,821
Just grand.

945
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,074
There's the bridges over there.

946
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:12,159
And there's all New York
to pick from.

947
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,662
Ain't the lights great?

948
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,791
And the East River.

949
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,503
And stars.

950
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:26,006
Aren't they beautiful?

951
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,050
Not phony ones either.

952
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:35,099
Gee, a roof like this would be
a swell place for... kids to play.

953
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:37,017
Wouldn't it, Eddie?

954
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,812
You know, they could get
plenty of fresh air...

955
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,731
and their mothers wouldn't have
to worry about streetcars...

956
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,900
and taxis and trucks and things.

957
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,154
You know, rich kids couldn't
have a better place than this.

958
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,698
You like it, don't you, kid?

959
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,826
Oh, I think it's just grand.

960
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:56,245
I’m awful glad for Pat and Sue.

961
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:59,123
Okay. We better get back
to the bunch now.

962
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,796
You said it.

963
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,840
Sue, it's the grandest flat
I ever saw.

964
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,926
- I'm awfully glad you like it, Dot.
- Oh, it's sweet for anything.

965
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,886
Dot, sit down.

966
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:17,391
Here goes.

967
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:20,018
Well, kid, it's yours.

968
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:26,024
- Mine? What do you mean, mine?
- Sure. Yours.

969
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:28,735
This is where you're gonna live.
I bought it for you.

970
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,117
- You bought it for me?
- Sure.

971
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:38,078
You know that secret
about goin' back to work?

972
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:41,331
Well, I doped it out that
you wasn't satisfied where you're livin'.

973
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,417
So this is the answer.

974
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,005
- Well, what about your store?
- This Is It.

975
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,175
You spent all your money for this?

976
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,302
I shot the works.

977
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:56,889
- You mean, all of your money?
- We don't owe a nickel on Lt.

978
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,933
Well, what do ya say?

979
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,980
I don't know.

980
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:07,107
Don't seem to make
such a hit with ya now.

981
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,067
Naturally, Eddie.
She's surprised.

982
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,321
You can't get a thing like this
through your head in a minute.

983
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:15,949
- Did you know he was doing it, Edna?
- Yeah, I helped him fix It up.

984
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,577
Why'd you let him
spend all the money?

985
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,830
Well, folks, it looks like a bust.

986
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,832
Oh, no, it isn't, Eddie.

987
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:27,252
I think it's just great.
I’m tickled to death.

988
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:30,005
You're the swellest
husband any girl ever had.

989
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:30,964
Okay.

990
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,425
Dot's only disappointed
for you, Eddie.

991
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,552
She was so anxious for you
to have the store...

992
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,888
she didn't want you to spend
the money for anything else.

993
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,015
- That's right.
- Sure.

994
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:43,644
That's why, dear.
You know I think it's just swell.

995
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:45,145
Why'd ya do it?

996
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:49,441
Well, I figure, a long time dead.
Live while ya can.

997
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:53,445
That's what I say. When I think of
the way my folks used to live.

998
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:56,031
They didn't have enough money
to support themselves...

999
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:58,825
so they go and have nine kids.

1000
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:02,246
My old lady used to scrub floors
in an office building.

1001
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:04,498
4:00 every morning
she went to work-

1002
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:06,500
sick or well, summer or winter.

1003
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:11,213
I can see her goin' out
when It was 20 below zero...

1004
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:14,383
with a cough that'd tear
the heart out of ya.

1005
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:16,468
And for what?

1006
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:20,472
To bring up a couple of kids
and die-

1007
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:23,308
die before they was ever
any comfort to her.

1008
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,227
Not for Dot.

1009
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,980
Every nickel I make,
she and I are gonna spend on ourselves.

1010
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,857
- My sister died bringing up-
- Oh, stop it! Can't you stop it!

1011
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:34,236
You'd think there was nothin' else
in the world to talk about.

1012
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:37,739
All right. There, there, dear. Shh.

1013
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,410
What's wrong?

1014
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,620
Dot's going to have a baby.

1015
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:46,957
There's nothing to worry about, Eddie.

1016
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:49,501
No, she's just a little hysterical.
That's all.

1017
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,503
We shouldn't have talked
about those things.

1018
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:54,172
- That's right. I guess we shouldn't.
- Sue told me, but I forgot.

1019
00:59:56,551 --> 01:00:00,304
Gee, everybody in New York
seems to know about it...

1020
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:02,556
but the only guy that's interested.

1021
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,699
Oh, gee, Eddie,
I wish you'd let me do that.

1022
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:23,035
Don't be crazy, will ya?

1023
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:25,203
You're goin' to the hospital
in a few weeks.

1024
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,914
You know the doc told you
not to do any hard work.

1025
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:31,043
I don't think he knows what he's
talkin' about. I don't like him.

1026
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:34,546
- You want me to get you a different one?
- No.

1027
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:38,592
If you can't get the best,
he's as good as any of the others, I guess.

1028
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:41,720
He's all right.
I worry. That's all.

1029
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,723
- About what?
- About everything.

1030
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:47,434
You having to do this before you go
to work in the morning...

1031
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:50,145
and pinchin' every nickel
the way you have.

1032
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:52,147
I don't want a baby
any more than you do.

1033
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:55,942
All right, all right.
Now you told me that a thousand times.

1034
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,028
Let's not talk about it.

1035
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:04,701
ls there any other doctor
you got in mind?

1036
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:07,537
There was somethin' in the paper
about a society woman.

1037
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:10,999
The doctor's name was Burgess.
His picture was there.

1038
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,002
Gee, he was awful kind-lookin'.

1039
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:16,880
Not that we could get him.
He's only for millionaires.

1040
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:21,009
As long as you can't get him,
you might as well pick out the best.

1041
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,220
Whoo-ooh! Dot!

1042
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:25,806
Now don't bring her in here.
I don't want her razzin' me.

1043
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:30,018
- Good morning.
- Hello, Edna.

1044
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:32,771
- Hello, Eddie.
- So long.

1045
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,981
Floyd made such a racket,
I didn't wait for breakfast.

1046
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,150
- Got a cup of coffee?
- Sure.

1047
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:41,988
Hmm.

1048
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:45,242
You got a new washerwoman, I see.

1049
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:48,245
I figured you'd make that crack.

1050
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:51,498
You haven't got enough bluing
in this water.

1051
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:54,126
I knew somethin' would be wrong
with it when you seen it.

1052
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:59,214
- Here.
- Thanks. Got a cigarette?

1053
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:02,551
No, I cut 'em out.
They was puttin' my throat on the bum.

1054
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:04,553
Come on, Edna.
Drink this in the other room.

1055
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:07,389
Yeah, go on. Beat it, will ya?
You give me the willies.

1056
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:09,391
That's good.

1057
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:16,273
- How do you feel?
- Oh, all right.

1058
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:19,317
- How do you feel when you feel bad?
- I worry.

1059
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:23,947
Yeah, and you worry other people too.
You worry him.

1060
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:27,033
Your child'll probably grow up
to be a radio broadcaster.

1061
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,994
Gee, It's 10 minutes to 8:00.
I gotta blow.

1062
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,580
Don't touch those things.
I'll finish 'em when I come home.

1063
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:33,582
- Good-bye, darling.
- So long.

1064
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:37,377
- So long, meddlesome.
- Good-bye, grouch.

1065
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,005
Break a leg.

1066
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:43,216
- Swell guy.
- That's what makes me so miserable.

1067
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:46,845
- What?
- He's so square about everything.

1068
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,847
Says smoking hurts his throat.

1069
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,224
He cut it out so he could
save the money.

1070
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:55,312
It doesn't seem fair that he should
give up all his fun just because of me.

1071
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:58,815
Yeah, it's tough on husbands.

1072
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,194
Nobody knows what a husband
suffers when his wife has a baby...

1073
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:04,654
and a big juicy raspberry.

1074
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:09,743
It must be great for a woman
when everything is right-

1075
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:13,538
you know, when she can afford
a doctor like that man Burgess...

1076
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,749
and when she knows
her husband wants the baby.

1077
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:18,043
You want it, don't you, Dot?

1078
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:20,420
I’m crazy about it.
That is, I would be...

1079
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:23,548
if it weren't for Eddie
and if I wasn't afraid.

1080
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,718
- How do you know he doesn't want it?
- The things he says.

1081
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:30,388
I can feel it, too, in the way he acts.
He doesn't like children.

1082
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:34,559
Coochie-coo. Coochie-coo.
Coochie, Coochie, Coochie-coo.

1083
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:38,063
- Say, how old is it?
- Only seven months.

1084
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,565
Of course, all parents
are proud of their children.

1085
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:44,069
But honestly, even if this
was somebody else's kid...

1086
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:47,447
I'd have to admit it's
the cleverest youngster I ever saw.

1087
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:50,075
- Don't you think so, Mama?
- I honestly do.

1088
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:53,161
Hey, look it! The little son of a gun's
got a hold of my finger.

1089
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,622
That's what I mean. isn't that clever?

1090
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:59,709
- She's a darling. Look at her.
- Coochie-coo. Coochie-coo.

1091
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:03,338
Coochie, Coochie-coo. Coochie-coo.

1092
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:05,340
Coochie-coo.

1093
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,300
Hey, Eddie. Eddie.
Eddie.

1094
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:10,262
- Has Mr. Randall's set been fixed for him?
- Yes, sir.

1095
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:14,474
- Gee, that's a great kid you got.
- We think so.

1096
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,482
- Say, Mr. Lathrop?
- Yes?

1097
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:25,485
Do you think that a woman
havin' a baby...

1098
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:28,989
you know, that she hasn't
always wanted...

1099
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:32,117
could-could learn to love it...

1100
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:35,161
you know, as if she'd
always wanted it?

1101
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:37,747
Oh. Your wife, eh?

1102
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:39,708
She's afraid.

1103
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:43,628
Say, there ain't any danger
in these things, is there?

1104
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,423
Well, lots of women
manage to have babies...

1105
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:49,759
without calling out the militia.

1106
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:52,846
There's no danger when they
have the proper attention.

1107
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:55,432
She should be made to
have confidence in her doctor.

1108
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:57,684
That's just it.
My wife ain't got any.

1109
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,644
That's not right.

1110
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,439
- She speaks of a Dr. Burgess.
- Burgess?

1111
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:05,525
You'd have to be a millionaire to have him.

1112
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:06,693
Goin' to lunch, Eddie?

1113
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,404
Nah, I cut lunches out.
I was gettin' too fat.

1114
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,659
- This Dr. Burgess is good, huh?
- And expensive.

1115
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:18,288
When a king is born,
they send for him.

1116
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:21,166
I wonder how you could get in
to see a guy like that.

1117
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,710
- Mr. Lathrop, will you take
a look at this set, please?

1118
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:24,753
- Oh, yes. Certainly.

1119
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,301
Hey, Joe.

1120
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:34,137
- ls your brother still matchmaker
over at the Empire Club?

1121
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:35,597
- Yeah.

1122
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,350
Do you suppose he could get me on
in one of them preliminary fights?

1123
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,352
Say, some of those boys
are pretty good.

1124
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:42,938
- What do you wanna take a beatin' for?
- Ten bucks a round.

1125
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:45,941
Four rounds-40 bucks.
I can use that dough swell.

1126
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:48,485
I can fix it for ya, but
I think you're nutty.

1127
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:49,569
Okay.

1128
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:59,621
7:00. Say, ain't that job of yours
got any hours?

1129
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:02,332
A guy wanted his radio fixed,
so I did it on the side.

1130
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:04,334
I should think you'd try
gettin' home...

1131
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:06,461
with your wife goin' to the hospital
and everything.

1132
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:07,087
How is she?

1133
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:09,005
She's worrying herself sick.
That's how she is.

1134
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,924
But, gee, she oughtn't to do that.

1135
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:13,259
I don't think she knows that.
You ought to tell her.

1136
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:17,347
- You had any supper?
- I ain't hungry.

1137
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:20,141
Gettin' your beauty sleep, kid?

1138
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:24,521
Gee, Eddie, I don't think it would hurt you
to hang around once in a while.

1139
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:26,314
Okay.

1140
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,817
That "okay" does me
a lot of good, don't it?

1141
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:32,946
Gee, kid, you know
I'm for you, don't ya?

1142
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,698
Well, it don't look like it.

1143
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:37,200
You haven't spent an evening
in the house for two weeks now.

1144
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:42,539
I don't mean to be a grouch,
Eddie, but... I'm frightened.

1145
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:46,334
ls it the doctor?
Is that what makes you afraid?

1146
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:50,672
Oh, he's all right, I guess.
It's my fault.

1147
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:54,175
You know, you have confidence
in some people, and others you haven't.

1148
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:56,344
There's no reason.
You just have. That's all.

1149
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,471
Sure, I know how it is, kid.

1150
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:02,517
Eddie, you're gonna stick around and go to
the hospital with me tonight, ain't ya?

1151
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,644
You betcha.

1152
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,313
No. Wait a minute.

1153
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:10,400
- I tell ya, I gotta go out-
- Never mind. You don't have to bother.

1154
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:13,945
- Oh, no. Just for a half an hour, kid.
- Can't even stay with me tonight.

1155
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:17,240
I'll be right back.
Honest I will.

1156
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:20,368
Mmm. Your honey is
searching among the "bees."

1157
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:24,998
Hello?

1158
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:28,710
Yeah, this is his secretary. Mm-hmm.

1159
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:32,213
Who wants to talk to him? Joe?

1160
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,758
- There's a Joe wants to talk to you.
- Hello, Joe.

1161
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:39,637
Tonight? Sure I'll be there.
Hey, that's great.

1162
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:43,767
Lt comes just at the right time.
Thanks. So long.

1163
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:46,603
I'll be a little longer now,
but I'll be back at 9:00.

1164
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:48,188
I got another fella to see now.

1165
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:50,982
- You pick a swell night to make a date.
- You sure do.

1166
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:52,942
This ain't a date.
Honest it ain't.

1167
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:56,321
- I'll be back as quick as I can.
- Give my love to Jenny, will ya?

1168
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:59,157
- What Jenny?
- Whatever Jenny happens to be there.

1169
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,950
Okay!

1170
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:06,247
And-And tonight I'm takin' her
to the hospital.

1171
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:08,750
But I'm sure the doctor
you have is competent.

1172
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:13,254
Lt ain't that. You see, she's just
a kid herself, and she's frightened.

1173
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:15,548
Her mother died that way.

1174
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:18,176
She read about you
Ln the paper, Dr. Burgess.

1175
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:21,763
Well, of course, we never thought
we could get ya.

1176
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:23,807
She was sayin' that
It would be swell...

1177
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:26,768
If she could get a guy like you
to be with her.

1178
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,895
Did you tell her
you were coming to see me?

1179
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:32,816
No, sir. She and me ain't been
gettin' along very well lately.

1180
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:36,444
I've been workin' nights.
I didn't tell her about it.

1181
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:39,447
She thinks I’ve been
chiselin' on her, I guess.

1182
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:42,283
I can't tell things like that.

1183
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:44,869
I’m kind of a mug that way.

1184
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:46,996
Of course, I couldn't pay you
what you're worth.

1185
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:50,917
But I tell ya. I make 45 bucks a week,
and pick up 15 workin' nights.

1186
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,877
And I'm gettin' 40 bucks
in a fight tonight.

1187
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:55,380
And I got 381 saved up, see?

1188
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:57,841
- Are you a prizefighter?
- No, sir.

1189
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:00,009
But a friend of mine's
gettin' me on...

1190
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:02,428
in the preliminaries
over at the Empire Club.

1191
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:06,391
I get 10 bucks a round, and I don't mind
takin' a beating for 40 bucks.

1192
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:09,811
Listen, Dr. Burgess-

1193
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:12,480
I always been kinda proud, see?

1194
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:16,734
You know, pay my own way,
take nothin' from nobody.

1195
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,864
But I ain't that way now, Doc.

1196
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:22,866
I'm beggin' you.

1197
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:27,036
If she knew she was gonna
have you with her...

1198
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:30,039
everything would be all right.

1199
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:31,541
But as it is...

1200
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:34,335
she's so sick from worry-

1201
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:36,921
I’m afraid maybe she'll die.

1202
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:41,050
Will you do it, Doc?

1203
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,636
I'll give you the $381
I got saved up...

1204
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:45,722
and I'll pay you back
dollar for dollar.

1205
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:49,100
Please do it, will ya, Doc?

1206
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:54,606
So help me, God, I'll-
I'll lay down my life for ya.

1207
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:02,405
I'll take the case.

1208
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,662
Thanks.

1209
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:17,545
I guess I'm kinda nervous
about this child thing.

1210
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:18,838
Mm-hmm.

1211
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,841
Kinda goofy, huh?

1212
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:29,515
Gee, Doc, I'm sorry I haven't got a cigar
or somethin' to offer ya.

1213
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:34,979
I cut out smokin'.
Lt was hurtin' my throat.

1214
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:39,567
This is a swell dump you got here.

1215
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:42,028
Oh, I didn't mean-

1216
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:49,202
Okay.

1217
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:58,127
Flight!

1218
01:11:05,469 --> 01:11:08,012
- He said 9:00.
- Don't worry.

1219
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:10,890
You'd think the least he could do
would be to be with me tonight.

1220
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:13,476
Now, now, now.
Don't get yourself all worked up.

1221
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:26,239
One, two-

1222
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:36,040
Get out. Get out.

1223
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:40,044
Hey, Mike, knock that fella out, will ya?
This ain't a slaughterhouse.

1224
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:43,715
I wanted to give him a break, but I'll
put him away right at the next gong.

1225
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:48,636
Aw, why don't ya quit?

1226
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:52,307
I know what I'm doin'.

1227
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:54,809
I wouldn't take a beatin' like that
for a hundred bucks.

1228
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,769
Yeah?

1229
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:59,897
Well, that's the difference
between you and me.

1230
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:21,836
One, two, three, four...

1231
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,047
five, six...

1232
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:28,676
seven, eight, nine-

1233
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:37,101
Uh! Don't knock me out,
will ya, buddy?

1234
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:39,145
I need the cash.

1235
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:42,398
- My wife's gonna have a kid.
- Well, why didn't you tell me?

1236
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,693
I guess I can't make it though.

1237
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:48,654
Hold on to me.
Take a deep breath.

1238
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:51,783
Break it up.

1239
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:55,244
Thanks. Good-bye.

1240
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:57,246
I've arranged for the hospital.

1241
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,248
The cab will be here at 1 1 :00.

1242
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,334
I never thought
Eddie would do this to me.

1243
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,003
But, darling,
he's only an hour late.

1244
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:06,297
Some hours are lifetimes.

1245
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:09,217
He's walked out on me.

1246
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:19,102
- When's the kid expected?
- Any-Anytime now.

1247
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:21,729
- I got two of them.
- Yeah?

1248
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:28,319
How long before they get to know ya?

1249
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:31,614
Mine knew me inside of two months.

1250
01:13:31,698 --> 01:13:33,866
But of course, mine
was kinda extra bright.

1251
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:34,867
Yeah.

1252
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:56,389
Oh, gee, kid, I'm sorry to be late.

1253
01:13:56,515 --> 01:14:00,143
- It's too bad about you.
- I couldn't help it.

1254
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:03,146
Couldn't spend a couple of minutes
with me, tonight of all nights?

1255
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:05,148
You know how nervous I am.

1256
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:07,233
But you could go to some speakeasy
with a bunch of fellas...

1257
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,902
and get your face all battered up
in a drunken brawl.

1258
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:14,615
Is that what ya think?

1259
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,409
That's what it looks like to me.

1260
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:18,411
Okay.

1261
01:14:20,497 --> 01:14:22,498
Do you want me to go with ya?

1262
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,419
You don't have to bother about me
anymore at all, Eddie.

1263
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:38,431
I got Burgess for ya!

1264
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:59,410
- How about it, Doctor?
- Congratulations. Twins.

1265
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:02,038
- Twins?
- Twins.

1266
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:04,248
- Boys or girls?
- Both.

1267
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:06,209
- Twins!
- Yes, sir.

1268
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:11,464
The baby business is picking up.

1269
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:14,091
Sometimes I was here,
and I was the only one.

1270
01:15:19,139 --> 01:15:23,100
- This your first?
- Yes, and my last.

1271
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,896
I wouldn't go through this again
for all the money in the world.

1272
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:35,696
How many kids have you got?

1273
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:37,698
Six or seven.
Maybe eight.

1274
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:39,784
I don't know.

1275
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:41,953
You don't know?

1276
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:43,955
I know I got six.

1277
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:46,290
What's happening upstairs,
I can't tell ya.

1278
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:50,461
Here I am.

1279
01:15:50,587 --> 01:15:53,005
You're the father of a fine baby girl,
Mr. Vernon.

1280
01:15:55,592 --> 01:15:57,593
- Oh, well.
- Oh!

1281
01:15:57,636 --> 01:16:00,096
- Put him over here on the-
- Lt was too much for him.

1282
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:01,931
- He'll be all right.
- What's the matter with him?

1283
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:04,809
- I’ve got some smelling salts.
- That's fine. Give him some.

1284
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:07,436
- He'll be all right.
- He's as white as a sheet.

1285
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:09,438
He'll be all right in a minute.

1286
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:11,482
People kid about fathers,
but they don't realize...

1287
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:14,151
what a guy has to go through
when his wife has a baby.

1288
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:18,030
If he had as many as I got,
he'd stay unconscious.

1289
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:22,368
He's coming to now.
He's fine.

1290
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:26,289
- What happened?
- You just had a baby.

1291
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,419
I wouldn't go through this again
for all the money in the world.

1292
01:16:31,503 --> 01:16:32,670
Hold on, or he'll faint again.

1293
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:34,714
It's all right, Mr. Vernon.
You come with me.

1294
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:38,676
- Hold him up.
- Gee, I'm gettin' nervous myself now.

1295
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:43,180
Don't be nervous.

1296
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:46,434
Say, Mr. Linsky,
I wanna ask you a question.

1297
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:52,315
My wife wasn't any too anxious
to-to have this kid.

1298
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:55,359
Say, in two weeks,
she will be crazy about it.

1299
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:59,280
- ls that straight?
- They always are. Be careful.

1300
01:16:59,364 --> 01:17:01,907
Don't let her think that you are
more concerned for the baby...

1301
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,868
than what you are for her.

1302
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:06,120
Women get jealous
under those conditions.

1303
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:09,498
You know, be interested,
but not anxious.

1304
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,584
After all, you've known
your wife for years...

1305
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:14,253
and the baby is practically
a stranger.

1306
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:16,297
Yeah, that's right.

1307
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:18,591
Excuse me.
I gotta phone my partner.

1308
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,803
Mr. Collins?

1309
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:24,805
- Yeah?
- A boy.

1310
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,977
Okay.

1311
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:41,322
Your wife will see you
in just a few minutes now.

1312
01:17:41,406 --> 01:17:43,324
Thanks.

1313
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:49,538
Hey, what do you know about that?

1314
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:51,916
My kid's 22 hours old already.

1315
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,710
They get old very quickly
when they're young.

1316
01:17:59,132 --> 01:18:01,842
- Hello, Doctor. How are they?
- Fine.

1317
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:04,637
Say, Doc, I’ve got 350 bucks here.

1318
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:07,640
- And I'll give ya-
- Yeah, well, I have your bill here.

1319
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:10,017
Now, I have another patient.
I must hurry.

1320
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,977
- Good luck to you, my lad.
- Thanks.

1321
01:18:14,898 --> 01:18:17,274
Gee, he'll never let me
speak to him about money.

1322
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:23,572
It says paid in full.

1323
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:25,366
And here's a check.

1324
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:29,662
"Pay to the order of Mr. Edward Collins's
son-$50."

1325
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:32,540
What does that mean?

1326
01:18:32,582 --> 01:18:35,292
He's giving your boy $50
to start a bank account.

1327
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,421
And he wouldn't let me
give him anything.

1328
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:43,592
Gee. That's a guy for ya, ain't it?

1329
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:46,721
Oh, they're just grand, Mrs. Linsky.

1330
01:18:46,763 --> 01:18:50,558
Every time I have a baby,
my husband gives me a new bracelet.

1331
01:18:50,642 --> 01:18:53,686
If I don't stop,
I wouldn't have any more room.

1332
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:01,193
- What do you think of it?
- Oh.

1333
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:05,614
Oh, no, this isn't yours.
This baby's six days old.

1334
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:16,584
She acts like she hates the child.

1335
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:18,544
I guess maybe she didn't want it.

1336
01:19:18,628 --> 01:19:21,505
Do parents hate children
they don't want?

1337
01:19:21,548 --> 01:19:23,716
I heard of people like that.

1338
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:27,887
How do you like this one?

1339
01:19:27,971 --> 01:19:29,847
- Oh, it's darling.
- Oh, no.

1340
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:31,849
This is young Mussolini.

1341
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:14,183
Gee, it's funny when
you think of it, ain't it?

1342
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:18,979
Everybody in the world was once
just a little bundle like that.

1343
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:28,239
- Isn't this one cute?
- Oh, it's lovely.

1344
01:20:28,281 --> 01:20:31,867
Just look at those little hands.

1345
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:34,995
Did you ever see
such an adorable nose?

1346
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,456
Gee, it's swell.

1347
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:39,959
Don't you want to hold your baby?

1348
01:20:43,129 --> 01:20:45,589
Is this mine?

1349
01:20:48,885 --> 01:20:51,971
- Honest? Oh.
- This Is It.

1350
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:04,316
I wouldn't cry over It,
Mrs. Collins.

1351
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:06,610
It's not the first time
that a baby was born.

1352
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:11,115
No? Well, it's the first time
this baby was ever born.

1353
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:25,129
You can come in now.

1354
01:21:35,515 --> 01:21:37,433
Hello, kid.

1355
01:21:37,517 --> 01:21:41,145
- How do you feel?
- All right.

1356
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:44,982
Thanks for sending me the flowers.

1357
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:46,942
Okay.

1358
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:58,412
- ls that it?
- Yes, that's it, and it's no "it."

1359
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:04,418
Well, I didn't mean it that way.

1360
01:22:06,296 --> 01:22:08,631
Let's not talk about it.

1361
01:22:08,673 --> 01:22:11,508
- That suits me too, kid.
- I thought it would.

1362
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:14,637
We'll take him back
to the nursery now.

1363
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:33,322
I asked Dr. Burgess how we happened
to get a fine doctor like him.

1364
01:22:33,406 --> 01:22:35,407
He just laughed and said
that you'd tell me.

1365
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:40,454
Oh, my boss knew him.
He did it for him.

1366
01:22:40,538 --> 01:22:42,790
He give me a check for
the baby's bank too.

1367
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:43,582
He did?

1368
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,918
- Wasn't that swell of him?
- Yeah.

1369
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:48,087
Those big guys do a lot
of work for charity.

1370
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:51,757
So you think of your baby
as charity, do you?

1371
01:22:53,176 --> 01:22:55,678
No. I-

1372
01:22:57,097 --> 01:23:01,266
Well-Gee, everything I say
seems to be wrong.

1373
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:04,728
Oh, Eddie.
I’d give anything if-

1374
01:23:06,272 --> 01:23:10,317
well, if things were different.

1375
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:15,406
Aw, everything's gonna be
all right, kid.

1376
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:17,908
We ain't gonna stop living
just because we got a baby.

1377
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:20,619
You and me is gonna have a good time,
the same as always.

1378
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:24,164
Why, In six months
we'll have forgotten we got a kid.

1379
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:30,796
Please go now.
I'm tired.

1380
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,966
Sure.

1381
01:23:37,804 --> 01:23:40,764
- When'll you be home?
- In about two weeks.

1382
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,767
Well, hurry it up.

1383
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,562
I'll feel like steppin' out a bit.

1384
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:51,150
- So long, kid.
- So long.

1385
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:55,571
I'll be back every day.

1386
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:21,847
Oh, Mrs. Linsky,
she's getting bigger every day.

1387
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,682
What are you going to call her?

1388
01:24:23,767 --> 01:24:26,393
I’m calling her Shelly,
after my mother-in-law.

1389
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:29,021
Her name was Esther,
but it's close enough.

1390
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:32,608
Well, how are all the mothers today?

1391
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:35,611
- Hello, Edna.
- Hello.

1392
01:24:35,653 --> 01:24:37,613
- ls the cab downstairs?
- Yes. Are you ready?

1393
01:24:37,697 --> 01:24:38,947
Mm-hmm.

1394
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:41,992
- Are you leaving now?
- Yes.

1395
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:45,037
But I heard you tell your husband
that you were going tomorrow.

1396
01:24:45,121 --> 01:24:47,539
- I want to surprise him.
- Oh.

1397
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:49,541
Say, listen, kid.

1398
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:52,044
- Have you thought this thing over?
- Yep.

1399
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:57,049
I couldn't live with a man
that didn't like his own child.

1400
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:59,259
All he thinks about is stepping out.

1401
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:02,513
I couldn't go back to Eddie
for anything.

1402
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:04,598
I’d get to hate him.

1403
01:25:05,016 --> 01:25:07,142
Well, it's your funeral, kid.

1404
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:14,274
Well, what are you
going to do with that?

1405
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:18,403
Well, I thought maybe the kid
would like to fool around with it.

1406
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:20,864
What? A two-weeks-old baby?

1407
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:23,200
Well, it's only a little balloon.

1408
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:26,370
The doctor's in the ward.
You'll have to wait a few minutes.

1409
01:25:26,412 --> 01:25:29,748
- Dr. Gibson?
- Yes?

1410
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,667
Just a minute, please.

1411
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:34,169
- Hurry, Nurse Parson.
- Hurry, Doctor.

1412
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:36,088
- Where?
- The nursery.

1413
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:49,059
My baby.

1414
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:50,936
Something's happened to my baby!

1415
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:54,064
Something's happening to my baby.

1416
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:56,024
No, Mrs. Collins.
It's all right.

1417
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:59,319
- I want my baby! I want my baby!
- He's all right.

1418
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:01,822
- I want my baby!
- Please listen.

1419
01:26:01,865 --> 01:26:05,075
I want my baby!
I want my baby!

1420
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,910
I want my baby!

1421
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:10,706
- I want my baby!
- What's the matter, kid?

1422
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:12,708
- Something's happened to my baby.
- Where?

1423
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:15,210
In there!

1424
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:18,005
It's not your baby.
There's no danger.

1425
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:20,507
Your husband will get it.
Now, everything is all right.

1426
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:23,385
- It's all right.
- He's all right, kid. Look. Here he is.

1427
01:26:23,469 --> 01:26:25,679
- He's all right.
- It was Mrs. Burns's baby.

1428
01:26:25,763 --> 01:26:29,016
Nothing serious.
Just a little coughing spell.

1429
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:33,020
Oh, gee, kid.
I didn't know you liked it.

1430
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,733
And I thought all along
that you didn't like him.

1431
01:26:37,775 --> 01:26:39,484
That's a bright idea
to get in your nut.

1432
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:41,320
The things you said
that night in the flat-

1433
01:26:41,404 --> 01:26:42,863
you know, about your mother
and everything.

1434
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:45,240
Well, I thought like that then.

1435
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:48,035
But gee, it's different
when you got your own kid.

1436
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:51,622
Hey, look it. The little son of a gun's
got a hold of my finger.

1437
01:26:53,124 --> 01:26:55,959
Dr. Burgess said he had
a finely shaped head.

1438
01:26:56,002 --> 01:26:56,960
He did?

1439
01:26:57,003 --> 01:26:58,921
Hey, look out there, buddy.

1440
01:26:59,005 --> 01:27:01,465
You might have the future president
of the United States in this cab.

1441
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:02,966
That's what they all say.

1442
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:05,260
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, Eddie. Now don't, Eddie.

1443
01:27:09,849 --> 01:27:13,185
Hey. Let me hold him, will ya?

1444
01:27:13,269 --> 01:27:15,854
- You really want to, Eddie?
- Sure.

1445
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:17,981
Be careful.
Put your arm under his head.

1446
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:20,859
- Okay.
- There you go, baby.

1447
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:29,117
Say, Dr. Burgess was right
about the kid's head.

1448
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:32,829
That's the best-shaped
kid's head I ever saw.

1449
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:35,374
He has a lovely head, hasn't he?

1450
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:37,876
Oh, Eddie, give me the baby.
He's dribbling all over you.

1451
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:39,962
Dribbling? That ain't the half of it.

1452
01:27:40,004 --> 01:27:43,090
I'm wet clean through.
But it's okay.
