1
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,370
Folks, we've been here
for a long time now,

2
00:02:07,412 --> 00:02:11,788
listening to people talk
for months.

3
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:14,612
Complicated medical testimony.

4
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:20,914
A lot of emotion in this case.

5
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,984
There is not a person
in this room who isn't sorry

6
00:02:24,086 --> 00:02:26,607
about what happened
to Mr. Matthews.

7
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:31,317
It's a tragedy.

8
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,391
And when something
like this happens,

9
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:36,214
you desperately want
to blame someone, don't you?

10
00:02:36,248 --> 00:02:38,387
Someone else.

11
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,490
We understand that.
It's natural.

12
00:02:44,217 --> 00:02:47,960
But what have we got here?
What's the bottom line?

13
00:02:47,994 --> 00:02:50,383
It's Mr. Matthews' word

14
00:02:50,426 --> 00:02:54,802
against the East Shore Hospital,
isn't it?

15
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:58,072
That's exactly what it is.

16
00:02:59,643 --> 00:03:02,578
Now, obviously,
any decent human being

17
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,370
would want to believe
Mr. Matthews...

18
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:08,699
believe that he told the
admitting nurse, Mrs. Valdez

19
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:10,773
that he was diabetic.

20
00:03:10,812 --> 00:03:15,123
It would seem... poetic
that someone else was to blame.

21
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:17,173
It would feel right.

22
00:03:17,214 --> 00:03:20,957
But it wouldn't be fair.

23
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,267
Let's-let's think for a second.

24
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,342
Who's being blamed here?

25
00:03:24,383 --> 00:03:28,125
It's not some, some big bad
hospital corporation.

26
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,508
We're talking
about human beings.

27
00:03:31,552 --> 00:03:32,981
Four doctors, five nurses,

28
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:36,407
the hospital chief of staff
present at the time.

29
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:39,198
All of them there
for no other purpose

30
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:43,456
than to try and save
Jonathan Matthews' life.

31
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,108
Now, this is painful,
and I don't like doing this,

32
00:03:46,145 --> 00:03:48,218
but if we're all going to do
our jobs,

33
00:03:48,257 --> 00:03:49,981
I've got to bring this up again.

34
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:52,474
Mr. Matthews is an alcoholic.

35
00:03:52,514 --> 00:03:55,897
In July of 1979,
he tried to commit suicide.

36
00:03:55,938 --> 00:03:58,044
And, you know, even I was
surprised to learn

37
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:02,590
from the plaintiff's
own doctors, ironically,

38
00:04:02,628 --> 00:04:04,668
that this tragedy
could have been caused

39
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,049
by the abuse of alcohol.

40
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:10,973
So here's my point:

41
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:13,402
We all understand why

42
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:17,602
Mr. Matthews is blaming
the hospital...

43
00:04:17,638 --> 00:04:21,795
but nobody could have prevented
Mr. Mathews' suffering

44
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,252
except Mr. Matthews.

45
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:30,877
Listen to me.

46
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:32,229
Listen to me.

47
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:36,193
The table you delivered is
not the table I ordered.

48
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:38,404
I'm-I'm having a party
on Friday,

49
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,197
and the table sitting
in my dining room

50
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:43,201
looks like a goddamned turtle.

51
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:58,089
We find for the defendant
on all counts.

52
00:05:02,732 --> 00:05:04,871
Henry, that was great.

53
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:07,785
Bruce.

54
00:05:15,406 --> 00:05:17,773
See you back at the office.

55
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:25,355
Mr. Matthews, everyone.

56
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,951
Bottoms up.

57
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:31,215
Mr. Cameron?

58
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,458
Hi, thanks.

59
00:05:32,496 --> 00:05:33,544
Mm-hmm.

60
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,235
Like father, like son.

61
00:05:36,273 --> 00:05:38,280
Yeah, the old bastard
would have loved this one, huh?

62
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,728
Only if he'd pulled it off.

63
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:46,162
Mr. Turner.

64
00:05:46,194 --> 00:05:47,536
If Maxwell calls,

65
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,675
tell him we won East Shore,
and he owes me 50.

66
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:50,958
Mm-hmm.

67
00:05:50,995 --> 00:05:52,173
Don't give me this now.

68
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,421
Cancel my lunch tomorrow.

69
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:54,703
I'm going to work through,

70
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:56,397
and move the dinner
to next week.

71
00:05:56,435 --> 00:05:58,476
Go ahead and pull the file
on Briggs v. Gordon.

72
00:05:58,516 --> 00:06:00,174
Oh, what about
the Rosenberg brunch...

73
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:01,139
May I finish, please?

74
00:06:01,172 --> 00:06:03,059
I need that Martinson deposition
on my desk

75
00:06:03,092 --> 00:06:04,172
by 9:00 tomorrow morning.

76
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:05,140
Mm-hmm.

77
00:06:05,172 --> 00:06:06,634
Hmm, and call my wife

78
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:09,524
and tell her I can't make dinner
at 7:30.

79
00:06:09,557 --> 00:06:10,735
Mm-hmm.

80
00:06:10,773 --> 00:06:13,010
Tell her to call the Who'sits
and make it 8:30 instead.

81
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:14,420
Yes, sir.

82
00:06:14,518 --> 00:06:17,682
Because you're responsible.

83
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:18,646
And if you can't learn

84
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,086
to respect
other people's things,

85
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:21,809
then we're going to have
a big problem.

86
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:25,014
Now, you're not to leave
this room tonight.

87
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:26,673
You understand?

88
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:33,680
The sooner we get there,
the sooner we can leave.

89
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,833
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

90
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:37,360
Rosella, we're going now.

91
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:38,677
Good night, missus.

92
00:06:46,746 --> 00:06:47,924
Keys?

93
00:06:49,178 --> 00:06:50,640
Got 'em.

94
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:52,603
I can't.

95
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:54,741
Next week, all of our relatives
are coming in.

96
00:06:56,284 --> 00:06:57,593
George, you should get a boat.

97
00:06:57,628 --> 00:06:59,799
Oh, oh, and just send
them away, huh? I like that.

98
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,592
Last year when
Sarah's relatives came in,

99
00:07:01,628 --> 00:07:02,676
we chartered this boat...

100
00:07:02,716 --> 00:07:03,796
Oh, God, the boat, the boat.

101
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:05,146
You take them out.
You feed them.

102
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,642
They stare at the
Statue of Liberty.

103
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:08,092
Everybody's happy
and nobody talks.

104
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,052
They don't even realize

105
00:07:09,085 --> 00:07:10,427
they're not having
a conversation.

106
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:13,781
The only reason I came
was because it said "two. "

107
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:14,967
In the paper, two fireplaces.

108
00:07:15,006 --> 00:07:16,250
Right. So finally, I get there,

109
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:17,748
and she says,
"Oh, no, that's wrong,

110
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,034
but it's got two fire escapes. "

111
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,099
Juliette?

112
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,062
Julia.

113
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:25,273
Julia.

114
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,246
George, you and Julia
really must come

115
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:30,110
to our Christmas party.

116
00:07:30,144 --> 00:07:31,737
Come on now,
Sarah's got a recipe

117
00:07:31,776 --> 00:07:32,704
for trifle you'd kill for.

118
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:34,744
You must come.
We've chartered a boat.

119
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:37,085
Oh, come on!

120
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:47,968
Good evening, Mrs. Turner.

121
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:48,930
Hi, Eddie.

122
00:07:48,962 --> 00:07:50,489
Good evening, Mr. Turner.

123
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:07,138
Goddamn it.

124
00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:09,956
You should apologize to Rachel.

125
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,062
I don't want you dealing
with Tracy anymore.

126
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:14,687
If she doesn't replace this
table tomorrow, that's it.

127
00:08:14,726 --> 00:08:16,799
Henry...

128
00:08:16,838 --> 00:08:18,464
go tell Rachel you're sorry.

129
00:08:18,503 --> 00:08:19,747
You never apologized.

130
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:22,466
Did you tell the caterer
we're 60 now?

131
00:08:29,544 --> 00:08:31,649
Okay.

132
00:08:44,906 --> 00:08:46,816
Hi.

133
00:08:56,588 --> 00:08:59,720
I was angry.

134
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:02,506
I admit I was angry.

135
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,468
But...

136
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,436
with a reason.

137
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:09,641
My piano is
very important to me.

138
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:13,453
It's like your doll.

139
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:14,631
Frank's your baby.

140
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,874
How would you react
if I spilled grape juice

141
00:09:16,911 --> 00:09:17,893
all over your baby?

142
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,734
His name isn't Frank.

143
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:27,373
Rachel, the point is,
if you can't be responsible,

144
00:09:27,408 --> 00:09:29,416
don't take food
out of the kitchen.

145
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:36,236
Finished a real big case today,
honey.

146
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:38,827
And Daddy won.

147
00:09:40,242 --> 00:09:42,151
Okay?

148
00:09:42,194 --> 00:09:43,568
All better?

149
00:09:45,363 --> 00:09:49,706
Qui tacet consentire videtur.

150
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:55,212
He who is silent is understood
to consent.

151
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:11,955
I told Rosella to get
some cigarettes.

152
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,998
Goddamn it.

153
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:18,229
Frances said Carol's daughter
wasn't accepted at Huntington.

154
00:10:18,263 --> 00:10:20,118
They're all dying Rachel got in.

155
00:10:21,975 --> 00:10:24,015
Carol's daughter's
a virtual idiot.

156
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:38,485
I'm gonna go get some.

157
00:10:38,522 --> 00:10:40,562
I'll be right back.

158
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:41,912
Don't forget your keys.

159
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:07,738
Pack of Merits.

160
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:10,999
Pack of Merits.

161
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,347
Cigarettes.

162
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:17,690
Look, any time tonight
would be okay.

163
00:11:20,031 --> 00:11:21,689
What a fucking day.

164
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:22,873
Come on.
Give me your wallet.

165
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:23,839
Give me a break, will you?

166
00:11:23,872 --> 00:11:25,049
I just want
a pack of cigarettes.

167
00:11:30,113 --> 00:11:32,961
All right, wait a second,
wait a second.

168
00:11:35,457 --> 00:11:37,759
All right, wait a minute.

169
00:11:37,794 --> 00:11:39,682
Will-will you just wait
a minute?

170
00:11:54,404 --> 00:11:56,193
I know.
I got to go.

171
00:11:57,892 --> 00:12:01,308
Okay. Good night.

172
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:05,315
You should glue the keys
to your hand, Henry.

173
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,857
What, what is it?

174
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,575
Excuse us. Excuse us.

175
00:12:29,608 --> 00:12:30,721
Hello?

176
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:32,933
This is Mrs. Turner.
Henry Turner.

177
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:38,441
Mrs. Turner?

178
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:40,384
Mrs. Turner?

179
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,336
Nurse.

180
00:13:01,517 --> 00:13:02,445
So he's driving,

181
00:13:02,477 --> 00:13:04,070
he just went off
the side of the road.

182
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,110
Doctors say forget it...
no chance.

183
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:09,354
Three months later,
he beat me in tennis.

184
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,797
I swear to God.

185
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:11,758
You never know.

186
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,384
I mean, you never know.

187
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,198
Sarah.

188
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:18,792
Sarah, darling.

189
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,719
We're here.

190
00:13:20,751 --> 00:13:22,574
We're here.

191
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:33,447
What did the neurologist say
is going to happen to Dad?

192
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:36,523
He said he didn't know.

193
00:13:52,692 --> 00:13:54,579
Rachel says "Hi. "

194
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:56,173
So does everyone.

195
00:13:56,213 --> 00:13:59,726
The phone hasn't stopped
ringing all week.

196
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,726
Rosella keeps rewashing
your shirts

197
00:14:03,765 --> 00:14:04,976
so she has something to do.

198
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:08,975
She's... she's being great,
just wonderful.

199
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,381
My mother says "Hi. "

200
00:14:11,415 --> 00:14:13,204
She wanted to fly in.

201
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:16,022
You know, always trying to help.

202
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:19,220
She asked what she could
possibly do.

203
00:14:19,256 --> 00:14:22,770
I said, "Don't come. "

204
00:14:24,953 --> 00:14:26,862
Rachel got her school uniform.

205
00:14:26,905 --> 00:14:29,239
It's-it's
the most adorable thing.

206
00:14:29,273 --> 00:14:31,477
She put it on and she said,

207
00:14:31,513 --> 00:14:35,605
"Mom, I don't feel smart. "

208
00:14:45,276 --> 00:14:47,163
Henry...

209
00:14:47,196 --> 00:14:50,230
I know you can hear me.

210
00:14:53,884 --> 00:14:55,510
Okay, you can open one present.

211
00:14:55,548 --> 00:14:57,239
We'll do the rest
in the morning.

212
00:14:57,277 --> 00:14:58,521
Okay, I'll tell him.

213
00:14:58,557 --> 00:14:59,637
You go to sleep now.

214
00:14:59,677 --> 00:15:02,198
I'll be home soon
to tuck you in.

215
00:15:02,238 --> 00:15:03,645
Okay.

216
00:15:03,678 --> 00:15:04,922
I love you.

217
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,168
Goodnight, sweetheart.

218
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:14,236
Well, I'm going home now.

219
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:18,229
Goodnight, sweetheart.

220
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:26,647
I'll see you tomorrow.

221
00:15:29,217 --> 00:15:30,145
Goodnight, Claudia.

222
00:15:30,177 --> 00:15:31,584
Goodnight, Sarah.

223
00:15:31,618 --> 00:15:33,691
Merry Christmas.

224
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,344
Oh, my goodness.

225
00:15:53,381 --> 00:15:55,203
Look who's awake.

226
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:57,692
Hello, honey.

227
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:59,359
Let me go and call your doctor.

228
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:06,981
Hi.

229
00:16:14,343 --> 00:16:16,580
Hi.

230
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:24,512
Hi, darling.

231
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:27,718
Hi, darling.

232
00:16:35,914 --> 00:16:37,605
Mrs. Turner,

233
00:16:37,642 --> 00:16:40,807
your-your husband's
incredibly lucky.

234
00:16:40,843 --> 00:16:45,284
The bullet wound to the head
caused minimal damage.

235
00:16:45,324 --> 00:16:48,488
See, it... it hit
the right frontal lobe.

236
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:50,281
That's the only part
of the brain

237
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:51,843
that has redundant systems.

238
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:54,535
I mean, if you're going
to get shot in the head,

239
00:16:54,573 --> 00:16:56,460
that's... that's
the way to do it.

240
00:16:58,605 --> 00:17:01,769
But... I, uh, I...

241
00:17:01,806 --> 00:17:03,213
can't lie to you,

242
00:17:03,246 --> 00:17:05,766
I wish I had all good news.

243
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:11,852
The other bullet... hit
the subclavian artery.

244
00:17:11,887 --> 00:17:13,927
There was excessive
internal bleeding

245
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,618
and cardiac arrest.

246
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:19,078
Your husband suffered anoxia.

247
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,022
It's a lack of oxygen
to the brain.

248
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:25,578
And the anoxia caused
some damage.

249
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:31,150
What I'm getting at...

250
00:17:31,185 --> 00:17:33,903
is that it's going
to be a long,

251
00:17:33,938 --> 00:17:35,793
tough rehabilitation.

252
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:38,379
How long?

253
00:17:38,418 --> 00:17:41,354
We'll know a lot more
in three months.

254
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:43,217
The brain is very mysterious.

255
00:17:43,252 --> 00:17:45,707
Even though your husband
seems to have

256
00:17:45,747 --> 00:17:48,595
the capacity to recover,
there's no telling

257
00:17:48,628 --> 00:17:52,425
how well or how long
it might take.

258
00:17:52,468 --> 00:17:53,843
In some ways,

259
00:17:53,876 --> 00:17:57,226
he's starting
from scratch here.

260
00:17:59,189 --> 00:18:01,873
Mrs. Turner...

261
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,757
Henry can't speak.

262
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,197
He can't move.

263
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:08,751
His motor skills aren't
functioning properly.

264
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,791
His memory might be
deeply affected.

265
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:15,247
Certainly, one day,
everything might come back,

266
00:18:15,288 --> 00:18:17,972
but there are no guarantees.

267
00:18:18,968 --> 00:18:22,766
He might not be able
to regain his speech

268
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:25,176
or physical coordination.

269
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:27,991
Ever.

270
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,088
So, how's Dad?

271
00:18:37,211 --> 00:18:40,245
He's doing great, sweetheart.

272
00:18:41,531 --> 00:18:43,735
The rehabilitation clinic's
going to be

273
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:45,495
much better than the hospital.

274
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:48,434
He wants to get better
before you see him.

275
00:18:54,973 --> 00:18:57,526
Can we get a puppy?

276
00:18:59,294 --> 00:19:02,011
Maybe we will, honey.

277
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:22,618
Charlie called yesterday.

278
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:25,177
He says this is
a really great place.

279
00:19:25,217 --> 00:19:27,738
Everybody knows
about this place.

280
00:19:27,777 --> 00:19:31,258
But he can't wait to throw you
a welcome back party.

281
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:32,956
And for the 500th time,

282
00:19:32,994 --> 00:19:35,646
he wants me to tell you
not to worry,

283
00:19:35,683 --> 00:19:37,658
everything's under control.

284
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:42,435
Just take your time,
but get back immediately.

285
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,395
It's so pretty here, isn't it?

286
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,940
Hello.

287
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,225
- Mrs. Turner?
- Yes.

288
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:53,985
I'm Dr. Marx, Chief of Staff.

289
00:19:54,021 --> 00:19:54,949
Hi.

290
00:19:54,981 --> 00:19:56,127
Hi, Henry.

291
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:58,140
How's everything going so far?

292
00:19:58,181 --> 00:20:00,069
'Cause I'm the boss around here.

293
00:20:00,102 --> 00:20:02,851
If you have any problems,
you complain to me.

294
00:20:02,886 --> 00:20:04,861
What a beautiful little girl.

295
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:06,309
Yeah, that's Rachel.

296
00:20:06,343 --> 00:20:07,587
How old is she?

297
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,150
She's going to be 12.

298
00:20:09,192 --> 00:20:11,331
This your little girl, Henry?

299
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:15,394
Is this your daughter?

300
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,557
Do you remember your daughter?

301
00:20:23,242 --> 00:20:25,697
Do you remember your wife?

302
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,124
Henry?

303
00:20:33,162 --> 00:20:35,497
Do you know who this is, Henry?

304
00:20:55,405 --> 00:20:56,966
What do you think?

305
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,526
Oh...

306
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:01,093
Look at you.

307
00:21:02,447 --> 00:21:04,334
Brings out your beautiful eyes.

308
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:05,796
Come here, look.

309
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:09,703
See?

310
00:21:09,743 --> 00:21:10,856
Now, the secret is

311
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,383
is to send the thank you note
right away

312
00:21:13,423 --> 00:21:15,595
before a month goes by,
and Aunt Maggie thinks

313
00:21:15,632 --> 00:21:17,356
you've forgotten
all about her, okay?

314
00:21:24,145 --> 00:21:27,790
Are we going to be poor now?

315
00:21:27,825 --> 00:21:29,320
What?

316
00:21:31,826 --> 00:21:34,347
Jennifer Lerner said
that her mother said

317
00:21:34,387 --> 00:21:38,032
that with Dad in the hospital,
and the way we spend money,

318
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:42,029
that we're going to be out
on the street in six months.

319
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:45,068
Is that true?

320
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:49,265
You can tell Jennifer Lerner
that her mother

321
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,188
doesn't know what the hell
she's talking about.

322
00:21:51,221 --> 00:21:53,709
And that if she has anything
to say to me... anything at all...

323
00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:56,881
her mother better pick up
the phone and call me herself.

324
00:21:56,918 --> 00:21:58,893
Who the hell does she think
she is?

325
00:22:02,806 --> 00:22:04,781
Sorry.

326
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,718
It's okay.

327
00:22:16,088 --> 00:22:19,602
Now, can you pick the circle?

328
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,937
Yeah, very good.

329
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,694
Yes, one for one.

330
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,810
All right.

331
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,568
Now, can you find
the triangle?

332
00:22:37,052 --> 00:22:38,296
Close.

333
00:22:38,331 --> 00:22:39,892
Now, I'll give you a hint:

334
00:22:39,932 --> 00:22:41,012
that's not it.

335
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:42,459
It's green.

336
00:22:42,492 --> 00:22:45,209
The triangle is green.

337
00:22:49,053 --> 00:22:51,257
Yes, very good!

338
00:22:51,294 --> 00:22:53,465
All right, Henry,
we're on our way.

339
00:22:55,134 --> 00:22:56,344
Come in.

340
00:22:56,382 --> 00:22:58,292
Good afternoon, Mr. Turner.

341
00:22:58,334 --> 00:22:59,414
Hey, Bradley.

342
00:22:59,454 --> 00:23:00,698
How's it going, Red?

343
00:23:00,735 --> 00:23:02,295
We're just finishing up here.

344
00:23:02,335 --> 00:23:03,709
How you doing, Hank?

345
00:23:03,743 --> 00:23:07,059
Henry's doing just fine,
right, Henry?

346
00:23:08,031 --> 00:23:09,275
I'll see you guys later.

347
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,392
All right.

348
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:11,512
Bye.

349
00:23:11,552 --> 00:23:12,796
Look, if you don't want

350
00:23:12,832 --> 00:23:14,523
to talk at first, it's cool.

351
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,470
I was a shy kid.
Kept to myself.

352
00:23:16,513 --> 00:23:17,975
Name's Bradley.

353
00:23:18,017 --> 00:23:19,839
I'll be your physical therapist

354
00:23:19,873 --> 00:23:21,815
for the remainder
of the evening.

355
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,832
Your own personal gym teacher.

356
00:23:23,874 --> 00:23:26,940
See that wheelchair?

357
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:30,874
That's going to be your
best friend for a while.

358
00:23:30,915 --> 00:23:33,785
Ready?

359
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,435
All right!

360
00:23:37,476 --> 00:23:39,581
My man.

361
00:23:41,476 --> 00:23:43,517
Mr. Casella!

362
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:47,201
Watch out.
You're looking sharp, sharp.

363
00:23:47,237 --> 00:23:48,993
Bradley.

364
00:23:50,437 --> 00:23:51,899
That's Mr. Casella.

365
00:23:51,942 --> 00:23:53,469
He's from Kentucky.

366
00:23:54,758 --> 00:23:55,686
Hi, Bradley.

367
00:23:55,718 --> 00:23:56,646
Julie.

368
00:23:56,678 --> 00:24:00,094
Check out the new uniform. Yow!

369
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:02,622
Hmm! I got to get me
some of that.

370
00:24:05,415 --> 00:24:07,390
Don't get any wrong ideas, man.

371
00:24:07,432 --> 00:24:09,155
This isn't cause I like it.

372
00:24:09,192 --> 00:24:11,297
It's to get you back
in the swing.

373
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:13,856
You're going to be playing
basketball before you know it,

374
00:24:13,896 --> 00:24:15,969
jogging ten miles a day.

375
00:24:17,097 --> 00:24:20,895
I hear you haven't been talking
very much, is that true?

376
00:24:20,938 --> 00:24:25,313
Tell me Hank, is that true,
or just a nasty-ass rumor?

377
00:24:26,314 --> 00:24:27,459
Hmm.

378
00:24:27,498 --> 00:24:29,059
Must be true.

379
00:24:29,098 --> 00:24:30,026
Yo, Gloria.

380
00:24:30,058 --> 00:24:30,986
Bradley.

381
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:33,223
That's Gloria.

382
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:35,715
Already had me some of that.

383
00:24:40,108 --> 00:24:42,955
I'll leave you alone so
you can talk about it.

384
00:24:52,237 --> 00:24:53,350
I love this place!

385
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,300
This is fabulous.

386
00:24:55,342 --> 00:24:56,422
I love it.

387
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,916
I'm so glad.
I'm so glad.

388
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:00,420
I haven't done this in ages.

389
00:25:00,463 --> 00:25:02,089
Well, you're a genius,
you know that.

390
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:04,975
New York real estate needs you,
my dear.

391
00:25:05,008 --> 00:25:06,601
This country needs you.

392
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:09,323
I know that you know this,

393
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,565
but if you or Rachel
ever need anything...

394
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,193
Please, no.

395
00:25:13,233 --> 00:25:14,411
No, seriously.

396
00:25:14,449 --> 00:25:16,489
Pity scares me.

397
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:20,556
Actually, this whole thing's
making me a stronger person.

398
00:25:20,593 --> 00:25:22,284
Really.

399
00:25:22,386 --> 00:25:26,609
And Henry's getting better
every day, so...

400
00:25:26,643 --> 00:25:29,327
Sarah, this is me
you're talking to.

401
00:25:36,724 --> 00:25:39,058
He can't walk.

402
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:41,459
He can't speak.

403
00:25:41,493 --> 00:25:45,552
He doesn't...
remember us.

404
00:25:47,477 --> 00:25:52,212
Nobody knows what's going
to happen.

405
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:54,134
I talked to our accountant
last week.

406
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,785
And?

407
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:59,670
Well, it's not good.

408
00:25:59,703 --> 00:26:02,932
We have nothing put away,
really.

409
00:26:02,968 --> 00:26:04,691
A few stocks.

410
00:26:04,728 --> 00:26:06,670
All we have is the apartment,

411
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:10,160
which isn't worth what it was
five years ago.

412
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:13,682
Without Henry's income,
things...

413
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:16,438
maybe not tomorrow, but things
are going to have to change.

414
00:26:16,473 --> 00:26:20,085
Honey, can I give you
a little advice?

415
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:24,824
Don't, do not tell anyone else
what you just told me.

416
00:26:24,858 --> 00:26:26,134
Mm-hmm.

417
00:26:26,171 --> 00:26:27,633
If I were you,

418
00:26:27,675 --> 00:26:30,577
I would... go out
with a few friends,

419
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:33,008
and spend a whole lot of money.

420
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,500
Would you like
to walk through again?

421
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,328
Oh, no, I don't have to, thanks.

422
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:39,574
I'll take it.

423
00:26:39,613 --> 00:26:40,561
See what I mean?

424
00:26:40,605 --> 00:26:42,677
Just like that.

425
00:26:44,157 --> 00:26:45,652
Come on... ball.

426
00:26:45,693 --> 00:26:50,647
Now, you can hear the word
in your head, can't you?

427
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:53,653
Good, good, now,
try to say it.

428
00:26:53,694 --> 00:26:54,840
Come on.

429
00:26:54,878 --> 00:26:57,748
You can do it.

430
00:26:57,791 --> 00:26:59,766
Ball.

431
00:26:59,807 --> 00:27:02,874
I know this is frustrating
for you,

432
00:27:02,911 --> 00:27:05,879
but you can do it. Ball.

433
00:27:08,992 --> 00:27:10,105
Come in.

434
00:27:10,144 --> 00:27:11,606
Boom ba doomp boomp

435
00:27:11,681 --> 00:27:13,470
Ow! Boomp, boomp, boomp

436
00:27:13,505 --> 00:27:15,774
Boomp, boomp,
boomp, boomp, ow!

437
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:17,697
Danananananaong!

438
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:19,104
Ah!

439
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,250
Hello, Bradley.

440
00:27:20,322 --> 00:27:22,843
Thank you, thank you,
good night.

441
00:27:22,882 --> 00:27:24,704
You've been
a wonderful crowd.

442
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:26,168
Yo, what's up?

443
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,666
Oh, just working
with the strong, silent type.

444
00:27:28,707 --> 00:27:30,431
Still no word
from the man, huh?

445
00:27:30,467 --> 00:27:33,402
No, but we're making progress.

446
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,118
Breakfast.

447
00:27:56,326 --> 00:27:57,636
Thank you.

448
00:27:57,671 --> 00:28:00,006
Mm-hmm.

449
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:00,988
Here you go.

450
00:28:01,031 --> 00:28:02,209
Thank you.
It looks fine.

451
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:03,393
All right, listen.

452
00:28:03,496 --> 00:28:04,838
Since you're still not making

453
00:28:04,872 --> 00:28:07,239
any noise,
I'm choosing the menu.

454
00:28:07,304 --> 00:28:10,021
When you start to talk,
you can pick.

455
00:28:10,057 --> 00:28:11,072
Eggs Bradley.

456
00:28:11,145 --> 00:28:12,836
Made 'em myself.

457
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,152
Hope you like 'em.

458
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,366
What's wrong,
don't like my eggs?

459
00:28:35,404 --> 00:28:37,193
Ah! Agh! Ah!

460
00:28:37,228 --> 00:28:39,465
What? Okay, okay, I
heard you, I heard you.

461
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:41,323
Don't be pretending
you can't talk.

462
00:28:41,357 --> 00:28:44,226
Listen, if you don't speak,
I don't know what you want.

463
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,764
All you got to do is tell me.

464
00:28:45,805 --> 00:28:46,733
Anything you want.

465
00:28:46,765 --> 00:28:48,522
All you go to do
is make the call.

466
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,248
This is like room service here,
man.

467
00:28:50,286 --> 00:28:51,399
You ever been to a hotel?

468
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,364
So, what do you want?

469
00:28:52,463 --> 00:28:53,870
Cheeseburger? Huh?
No, no, no.

470
00:28:53,903 --> 00:28:55,877
You like caviar
and shit like that, right?

471
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,090
Cool, man, just-just tell me
you want caviar.

472
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:00,744
Come on, say "caviar. "

473
00:29:00,784 --> 00:29:01,831
"Ca-vi-ar. "

474
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:06,767
What? Come on, man, say it.

475
00:29:06,865 --> 00:29:08,327
R- Ritz.

476
00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:09,547
Ritz?

477
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:12,526
You want some crackers?

478
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:15,047
You can have anything you want,
and you want some crackers.

479
00:29:16,402 --> 00:29:19,566
Get this man some Ritz crackers!

480
00:29:19,602 --> 00:29:20,779
Ritz.

481
00:29:23,123 --> 00:29:25,098
The work they do at Lawrence

482
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:27,474
is just... inspiring.

483
00:29:27,507 --> 00:29:28,936
Henry's doing wonderfully.

484
00:29:28,979 --> 00:29:30,703
You wouldn't believe your eyes.

485
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,457
I knew he'd set records
for recovery.

486
00:29:33,492 --> 00:29:35,565
Well,
you'd be very proud of him.

487
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:36,847
He's working hard.

488
00:29:36,884 --> 00:29:37,997
Working hard... Henry?

489
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:39,979
I can't imagine.

490
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,061
Every day I'm there,
it just amazes me.

491
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:43,246
He's lucky to have you.

492
00:29:43,285 --> 00:29:44,398
I second that.

493
00:29:44,437 --> 00:29:45,550
Thank you.

494
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:46,899
I wanted to ask.

495
00:29:46,934 --> 00:29:49,390
Now, don't take this
the wrong way, darling.

496
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:54,384
I wanted to make sure...
that things are under control.

497
00:29:54,422 --> 00:29:55,666
That you're okay.

498
00:29:55,735 --> 00:30:00,437
Well... considering,
I'm perfect.

499
00:30:00,472 --> 00:30:03,156
I really do think
everything's going to be okay.

500
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:05,648
It may take some time
to get back to normal,

501
00:30:05,688 --> 00:30:07,728
but... it's going to happen.

502
00:30:07,768 --> 00:30:09,045
I mean, financially.

503
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,422
Oh.

504
00:30:10,457 --> 00:30:12,399
Gee, I hate to leave you
with the bill,

505
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:13,903
but you'd be paying anyway,
right?

506
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,025
Got to get to court.

507
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:16,342
It was good to see you, Sarah.

508
00:30:16,378 --> 00:30:18,549
Oh, thank you.

509
00:30:18,586 --> 00:30:20,015
I know this is awkward.

510
00:30:20,058 --> 00:30:22,961
There are some things
we just don't talk about,

511
00:30:23,003 --> 00:30:25,753
but you and Henry are family,
you know that.

512
00:30:25,787 --> 00:30:27,730
Are you all right?

513
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:30,805
Because, if you need help,
anything, I'm prepared to...

514
00:30:30,844 --> 00:30:33,113
We're in wonderful shape.

515
00:30:33,148 --> 00:30:35,036
No problems.

516
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:36,148
Really, thank you.

517
00:30:36,189 --> 00:30:37,563
You're so sweet to offer.

518
00:30:37,597 --> 00:30:40,412
I knew
I could count on Henry.

519
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,860
All right, my man.

520
00:30:43,902 --> 00:30:45,877
You know what this is?

521
00:30:45,918 --> 00:30:48,123
It's called a walker.

522
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,501
Walker.

523
00:30:49,535 --> 00:30:51,576
Yeah, but that's
a load of bullshit,

524
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:53,655
'cause you're doing
all the walking.

525
00:30:53,695 --> 00:30:56,565
Now, let's see if we
can get you standing up, huh?

526
00:30:56,608 --> 00:30:58,299
Scoot up for me a little bit.

527
00:30:58,336 --> 00:30:59,318
Good, okay.

528
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,117
Sit tall, sit tall.

529
00:31:01,153 --> 00:31:03,008
Now lean towards me.

530
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:06,172
I want you to push up, push up
with your arms and your legs.

531
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,217
Push up, push up,
push up, very good.

532
00:31:08,258 --> 00:31:11,007
I got you, I got you,
don't worry about it.

533
00:31:11,042 --> 00:31:13,115
Good, very good.

534
00:31:13,154 --> 00:31:14,332
How's that feel?

535
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,607
I don't know.

536
00:31:16,643 --> 00:31:18,072
Yeah, all that upper-body work's

537
00:31:18,115 --> 00:31:19,260
getting ready to pay off.

538
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,683
Put your right hand over there
on the walker.

539
00:31:22,724 --> 00:31:26,336
Good, good, okay.

540
00:31:26,372 --> 00:31:27,780
I got you.

541
00:31:27,812 --> 00:31:29,339
You're doing real good, Hank.

542
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,788
Doing real good.

543
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:33,888
Okay, now, the first
thing I want you to do

544
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:36,413
is slide that
walker forward, okay?

545
00:31:36,518 --> 00:31:38,340
Slide your left leg,
and bend it.

546
00:31:38,406 --> 00:31:40,610
Slide your
left leg, and bend it.

547
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,579
Good, now stand tall,
stand tall, straight.

548
00:31:44,615 --> 00:31:47,136
Step.

549
00:31:47,175 --> 00:31:48,964
Good job, Hank, good job.

550
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:50,658
Now slide.

551
00:31:50,695 --> 00:31:54,209
Bend and slide your left leg.

552
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:59,235
Stand tall, and... step.

553
00:31:59,273 --> 00:32:01,062
Good job.

554
00:32:01,097 --> 00:32:03,040
Push the walker forward.

555
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:05,285
Bend and slide.

556
00:32:05,322 --> 00:32:06,947
Stand tall.

557
00:32:06,986 --> 00:32:09,604
Step, you're doing it man,
you're doing it, baby.

558
00:32:09,642 --> 00:32:11,071
Go ahead, push it forward.

559
00:32:11,114 --> 00:32:15,370
Left, left, bend, slide,
stand up straight.

560
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:16,548
Step. There you go, man,

561
00:32:16,587 --> 00:32:18,213
you're stepping
like a natural man.

562
00:32:18,251 --> 00:32:19,975
Go ahead, put that
left leg forward.

563
00:32:20,011 --> 00:32:22,662
Put it forward.

564
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,358
Step! Where's my video camera?

565
00:32:24,396 --> 00:32:27,178
We ought to be videotaping
this beautiful moment.

566
00:32:27,213 --> 00:32:29,417
Okay, bend that left leg.

567
00:32:29,452 --> 00:32:31,013
Slide it forward.

568
00:32:31,053 --> 00:32:32,035
Step! There you go, Hank!

569
00:32:32,141 --> 00:32:33,799
You're doing it, man,
you're doing it.

570
00:32:33,838 --> 00:32:35,114
Go ahead, bend that left leg.

571
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,328
Slide it forward.

572
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:48,050
So, my brother gets home, right?

573
00:33:48,087 --> 00:33:49,582
Goes into his bedroom.

574
00:33:49,624 --> 00:33:51,958
There's his wife
doing another man.

575
00:33:51,992 --> 00:33:53,814
The bitch was cheating.

576
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:57,110
She was...
she cheating?

577
00:33:57,145 --> 00:33:59,284
Doing the serious
with another man.

578
00:33:59,353 --> 00:34:01,109
Sleeping with another guy.

579
00:34:01,145 --> 00:34:02,323
Oh, no.

580
00:34:02,362 --> 00:34:03,638
Oh, yeah.

581
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:07,155
And she just looks up,
and all she says is "Oops. "

582
00:34:09,018 --> 00:34:11,669
So, so, then what?

583
00:34:11,707 --> 00:34:12,722
Loretta!

584
00:34:12,794 --> 00:34:15,129
- Hi.
- Looking hot.

585
00:34:15,163 --> 00:34:17,880
Mmm. She's hot.

586
00:34:17,915 --> 00:34:19,377
She's hot.

587
00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:20,980
Yeah, I-I know,

588
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,224
you-you've got to get you
some of that.

589
00:34:24,957 --> 00:34:27,128
Where you going
looking so pretty?

590
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,375
To get my dad.

591
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:29,940
He doesn't remember me.

592
00:34:29,981 --> 00:34:31,891
Let's go, sweetie.

593
00:34:35,294 --> 00:34:36,985
Thanks, Eddie.

594
00:34:37,022 --> 00:34:38,299
- Okay.
- Bye.

595
00:34:40,094 --> 00:34:42,910
Go up the West Side Highway,
please.

596
00:34:54,465 --> 00:34:56,505
What's up, man?

597
00:34:56,545 --> 00:34:59,066
Hey, man, what you doing?

598
00:34:59,105 --> 00:35:01,494
Painting.

599
00:35:01,538 --> 00:35:03,447
Crackers.

600
00:35:06,082 --> 00:35:08,701
Looks great.

601
00:35:08,738 --> 00:35:10,233
But you're not packed.

602
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,992
Why aren't you packed?

603
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:16,737
Um... I'm not going.

604
00:35:25,508 --> 00:35:27,712
Remember what Dr. Marx told you?

605
00:35:27,749 --> 00:35:30,116
Remember when we talked
about this

606
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,644
a couple days ago?

607
00:35:31,685 --> 00:35:35,614
Yeah. I-I-I changed
my mind.

608
00:35:35,654 --> 00:35:36,996
I'm going to stay.

609
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,419
Your wife and daughter
are coming to pick you up.

610
00:35:39,462 --> 00:35:40,542
You're going home.

611
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:44,642
But... I live here.

612
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:46,916
No, man, this is a pit stop.

613
00:35:46,952 --> 00:35:50,335
I hear you got
a beautiful place.

614
00:35:50,376 --> 00:35:53,410
You're not going to be there.

615
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:55,337
No.

616
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:57,800
No, I got to hang here.

617
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:00,354
But you got your family.

618
00:36:00,393 --> 00:36:03,492
But...

619
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,734
I- I...

620
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:06,981
I don't know them.

621
00:36:07,018 --> 00:36:08,513
I- I don't.

622
00:36:08,555 --> 00:36:09,602
They love you.

623
00:36:09,643 --> 00:36:11,017
They're going to take care
of you.

624
00:36:11,051 --> 00:36:12,131
Well, I don't want them

625
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:13,732
to take care of me,
Bradley, I don't!

626
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:15,015
- Listen...
- No, stop it!

627
00:36:15,051 --> 00:36:16,131
Hank, listen...

628
00:36:16,172 --> 00:36:17,099
Leave me alone, Bradley.

629
00:36:17,132 --> 00:36:19,271
Hank, you're gonna be fine.

630
00:36:19,308 --> 00:36:22,091
You got to go back sometime.

631
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:28,621
I just...

632
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:31,075
I just can't remember.

633
00:36:31,118 --> 00:36:34,085
I don't know those people.

634
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:50,408
I'll be right outside.

635
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:54,951
- Hi, Sarah.
- Hi.

636
00:36:54,993 --> 00:36:56,848
How you doing, honey?

637
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,091
Fine.

638
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,017
Hi, Henry.

639
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,577
Hi, Dad.

640
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:06,381
Hi.

641
00:37:12,276 --> 00:37:14,348
We think it's time
you come home.

642
00:37:14,388 --> 00:37:17,170
Yeah, uh, he told me.

643
00:37:17,204 --> 00:37:19,757
Bradley... told me.

644
00:37:19,796 --> 00:37:21,935
Is that okay?

645
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,500
Do you want to come home?

646
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:27,502
What about Bradley?

647
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:31,219
Bradley
can take care of himself.

648
00:37:31,254 --> 00:37:33,425
And you've got us.

649
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:35,055
And we're going to help you

650
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:37,580
in every way we can,
aren't we, honey?

651
00:37:37,623 --> 00:37:40,493
You've got a life back at home.

652
00:37:40,535 --> 00:37:42,739
A life with friends and family,

653
00:37:42,775 --> 00:37:45,197
and everything
you could ever want.

654
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:48,622
All you have to do
is say you want to come home.

655
00:37:48,665 --> 00:37:50,421
That's all.

656
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:52,244
It's easy.

657
00:37:55,929 --> 00:37:57,456
I don't want to.

658
00:38:05,562 --> 00:38:06,969
We already discussed this.

659
00:38:07,003 --> 00:38:09,622
I think it may be premature
for Henry to go home.

660
00:38:09,723 --> 00:38:12,090
I think he should want to first.

661
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,011
I just want what's best.

662
00:38:25,565 --> 00:38:27,475
Hi.

663
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:30,006
I'm Bradley.

664
00:38:37,886 --> 00:38:40,058
He's not mad at you.

665
00:38:40,095 --> 00:38:44,439
Hey, why don't you go
and talk to him?

666
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,699
Big loop...

667
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,806
little loop...

668
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:33,570
cross over...

669
00:39:33,607 --> 00:39:35,582
pull through.

670
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:41,221
How did you learn to do that?

671
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:43,295
You taught me.

672
00:39:45,544 --> 00:39:48,676
It was gray carpet.

673
00:39:48,713 --> 00:39:51,528
I remember gray carpet.

674
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:55,711
Where was that?

675
00:39:55,754 --> 00:39:57,925
That was home.

676
00:40:04,043 --> 00:40:05,985
I remember gray carpet.

677
00:40:06,027 --> 00:40:08,678
I want to go home.

678
00:40:11,756 --> 00:40:13,065
You okay, honey?

679
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,409
Come on, Rachel.

680
00:40:19,693 --> 00:40:21,351
Henry?

681
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:23,178
Come on.

682
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:29,160
A Walkman,
for a walking man.

683
00:40:29,198 --> 00:40:30,126
Wow.

684
00:40:30,158 --> 00:40:31,086
When you get home,

685
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,329
I want you
to listen to this

686
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:33,828
and think of
your friend Bradley.

687
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,813
Am I going to see you?

688
00:40:35,855 --> 00:40:36,782
Yeah.

689
00:40:36,815 --> 00:40:38,124
Promise?

690
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:40,047
Hell, yeah, I promise.

691
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,062
Okay, bye.

692
00:40:48,561 --> 00:40:50,088
Thanks.

693
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:53,544
Hey, it's what I do.

694
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:54,763
High five.

695
00:40:59,282 --> 00:41:00,230
Bye.

696
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:01,289
Bye.

697
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:34,711
Hi, Eddie.

698
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:35,671
Hi, Rach.

699
00:41:35,703 --> 00:41:36,631
Hi, Eddie.

700
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:37,591
Hi.

701
00:41:37,624 --> 00:41:38,551
Hi, Eddie.

702
00:41:38,584 --> 00:41:39,958
Good to see you, Mr. Turner.

703
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,602
Wow.

704
00:41:55,642 --> 00:41:59,766
This is home.

705
00:42:09,275 --> 00:42:12,145
Wow.

706
00:42:12,188 --> 00:42:14,076
I remember the smell.

707
00:42:14,109 --> 00:42:16,345
I don't smell anything.

708
00:42:16,381 --> 00:42:19,698
Nice table.

709
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:24,116
Henry?

710
00:42:24,158 --> 00:42:26,362
Yeah?

711
00:42:26,398 --> 00:42:28,438
Are you coming to bed?

712
00:42:32,287 --> 00:42:35,135
I'm gonna sleep there?

713
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:38,015
Yeah.

714
00:42:38,048 --> 00:42:40,437
This is your side.

715
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,073
Okay.

716
00:43:38,568 --> 00:43:41,830
I remember your hair.

717
00:43:46,569 --> 00:43:49,471
Everything's going to be okay.

718
00:43:49,514 --> 00:43:52,645
Everything.

719
00:43:55,722 --> 00:43:57,665
You look good, Mr. Henry.

720
00:43:57,707 --> 00:43:59,081
Real good.

721
00:43:59,115 --> 00:44:00,708
Your face and everything.

722
00:44:00,779 --> 00:44:01,990
Thanks.

723
00:44:02,027 --> 00:44:04,962
Oh, eggs.
No, I don't like eggs.

724
00:44:05,003 --> 00:44:06,083
What?

725
00:44:06,124 --> 00:44:07,717
- Eggs are your favorite.
- Yeah.

726
00:44:07,756 --> 00:44:10,244
Okay, give me a lot of eggs.

727
00:44:10,316 --> 00:44:11,909
This is wonderful.

728
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,291
All of us together again.

729
00:44:13,324 --> 00:44:15,845
We never used to eat breakfast
together.

730
00:44:15,885 --> 00:44:17,446
Well, I always wished we had.

731
00:44:17,485 --> 00:44:19,078
Oh, I'm sorry.

732
00:44:19,117 --> 00:44:22,730
That's okay,
I do that all the time.

733
00:44:22,766 --> 00:44:23,977
You do?

734
00:44:24,014 --> 00:44:25,159
Yeah.

735
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:27,206
See?

736
00:44:47,282 --> 00:44:48,743
Henry?

737
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:50,695
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

738
00:44:50,738 --> 00:44:52,876
Now, if you need anything,
just ask Rosella.

739
00:44:52,914 --> 00:44:55,369
Okay, the woman with the eggs.

740
00:44:55,474 --> 00:44:56,718
That's right.

741
00:44:56,754 --> 00:44:57,737
Ready.

742
00:44:57,779 --> 00:44:59,884
Okay, be back soon.

743
00:44:59,923 --> 00:45:01,264
Bye.

744
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:02,226
Bye.

745
00:45:02,259 --> 00:45:03,187
Bye.

746
00:45:03,219 --> 00:45:04,299
Did you get your books?

747
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:06,412
Yeah.

748
00:45:06,452 --> 00:45:08,427
I'm taking Rachel to school.

749
00:45:08,468 --> 00:45:09,515
Keep an eye on him?

750
00:45:09,556 --> 00:45:11,379
Is Mr. Henry okay?

751
00:45:11,412 --> 00:45:15,188
Yes. He's fine.

752
00:45:15,221 --> 00:45:18,091
Come on, honey.

753
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:19,660
You okay?

754
00:45:19,702 --> 00:45:21,262
Yeah.

755
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:47,409
You need anything, Mr. Henry?

756
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,752
No. Thank you.

757
00:45:49,786 --> 00:45:54,969
Rosella... what do I do,
uh, when I'm home?

758
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,719
You are working
all the time.

759
00:45:57,786 --> 00:45:59,642
I- I work a-a lot?

760
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:03,221
You work so hard,
I can't believe it.

761
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:07,221
What, what, what do I do
when I'm not working.

762
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,425
You're always working.

763
00:46:12,413 --> 00:46:15,195
Welcome home, Mr. Henry.

764
00:47:21,702 --> 00:47:23,907
Thank you.

765
00:47:23,942 --> 00:47:25,535
Just a minute, please.

766
00:47:34,312 --> 00:47:35,457
Hello, Mr. Turner.

767
00:47:35,496 --> 00:47:36,871
Hi.

768
00:47:41,257 --> 00:47:42,599
Hello, Mr. Turner.

769
00:47:42,633 --> 00:47:44,160
Hi.

770
00:47:48,554 --> 00:47:50,725
There you are.

771
00:47:50,763 --> 00:47:51,843
Thank you.

772
00:47:51,882 --> 00:47:52,897
Bye-bye now.

773
00:47:52,939 --> 00:47:53,887
Thanks.

774
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,220
Hi, Eddie.

775
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,918
Morning, Mr. Turner.

776
00:48:02,956 --> 00:48:04,516
I'm going to take
a walk now.

777
00:48:04,556 --> 00:48:06,597
Have a good time, sir.

778
00:48:15,085 --> 00:48:17,093
What are you?
A goddamn retard?!

779
00:48:17,134 --> 00:48:18,923
Get the hell out of the street!

780
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:26,926
Where's Henry?

781
00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:29,163
In your room, I think.

782
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:31,534
Henry, where are you?

783
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,011
Okay.

784
00:48:36,048 --> 00:48:37,477
Thanks.

785
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,895
Hi.

786
00:48:38,961 --> 00:48:39,855
Hi.

787
00:48:39,953 --> 00:48:40,935
Hungry?

788
00:48:40,977 --> 00:48:42,024
Yeah.

789
00:48:42,065 --> 00:48:43,407
That's what I like to hear.

790
00:48:43,441 --> 00:48:44,816
Mustard and kraut?

791
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:46,475
Kraut?

792
00:48:55,219 --> 00:48:56,626
Where is he?

793
00:49:15,478 --> 00:49:17,998
Hello. It's Henry.

794
00:49:33,176 --> 00:49:35,632
Check it out, check it out.

795
00:50:13,854 --> 00:50:14,999
Oh, my.

796
00:50:15,038 --> 00:50:17,559
He was wearing a blue shirt
and khaki pants.

797
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:21,014
Listen, you're the fifth person
to ask me these questions.

798
00:50:21,054 --> 00:50:22,713
I just want to find my husband.

799
00:50:52,835 --> 00:50:54,559
I'll wait here.

800
00:50:54,595 --> 00:50:56,003
I won't be long, sweetheart.

801
00:50:56,035 --> 00:50:58,424
I've just got to go look.

802
00:51:01,156 --> 00:51:02,880
Henry!

803
00:51:02,916 --> 00:51:04,323
Where were you?

804
00:51:04,357 --> 00:51:05,437
I bought a dog.

805
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:06,720
Mom, look!

806
00:51:06,757 --> 00:51:10,052
A puppy, look!

807
00:51:11,557 --> 00:51:12,637
Wow.

808
00:51:12,678 --> 00:51:14,434
You really missed me, huh?

809
00:51:14,469 --> 00:51:15,647
Can we call him Buddy?

810
00:51:15,686 --> 00:51:18,621
Jennifer has a dog named Buddy,
but he's really ugly.

811
00:51:18,662 --> 00:51:19,590
Buddy.

812
00:51:19,622 --> 00:51:20,637
Yeah, is that okay?

813
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:22,086
How you doing?
Sit, boy.

814
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:23,842
Yeah, Buddy's fine.

815
00:51:23,943 --> 00:51:25,918
Hi, Buddy.

816
00:51:25,959 --> 00:51:29,440
Just let me know
before you go out next time.

817
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,407
Okay?

818
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,367
Okay.

819
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,480
Sit, boy.

820
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,081
Excuse me.

821
00:51:34,121 --> 00:51:35,877
Shh. Oh, sweetie.

822
00:51:35,913 --> 00:51:37,440
Buddy...

823
00:51:37,481 --> 00:51:39,008
Why is she so mad?

824
00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:41,733
If you're going to be late,
you have to call her.

825
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:43,679
Oh.

826
00:51:43,722 --> 00:51:45,348
Okay.

827
00:51:45,419 --> 00:51:48,486
Some of them
you can borrow and take home,

828
00:51:48,523 --> 00:51:51,939
but some of them
you have to read here.

829
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,867
And you can't talk loud.

830
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,072
Right.

831
00:52:14,863 --> 00:52:17,002
Dad, stop it.

832
00:52:42,067 --> 00:52:43,561
Dad!

833
00:52:43,602 --> 00:52:45,708
I'm serious.

834
00:52:45,747 --> 00:52:46,925
I know.

835
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:49,036
V- Very.

836
00:53:14,647 --> 00:53:16,207
Dad.

837
00:53:16,247 --> 00:53:18,189
Read your book.

838
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:24,175
I can't.

839
00:53:26,008 --> 00:53:28,692
I'm sorry.

840
00:53:28,729 --> 00:53:29,973
A...

841
00:53:30,009 --> 00:53:31,089
Ah.

842
00:53:31,129 --> 00:53:32,209
Ah...

843
00:53:32,249 --> 00:53:36,046
Ah... roo...

844
00:53:36,089 --> 00:53:37,650
Ahroo,

845
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:39,097
ahrooee.

846
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:40,210
The "E" is silent.

847
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,290
- See, it's just "are. "
- Are. "

848
00:53:42,331 --> 00:53:44,786
Now Miss Petesky
always made us repeat it

849
00:53:44,827 --> 00:53:48,789
over and over,
but I won't make you do that.

850
00:53:48,827 --> 00:53:51,216
This next one's easy.

851
00:53:51,259 --> 00:53:52,405
Wiii...

852
00:53:52,444 --> 00:53:53,655
U...

853
00:53:53,692 --> 00:53:56,954
U... yoo...

854
00:53:56,989 --> 00:53:59,193
Yo...

855
00:53:59,229 --> 00:54:00,953
yo...

856
00:54:00,989 --> 00:54:02,069
Ooh.

857
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:04,957
Yo, youu.

858
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:06,551
Yo... ooh...

859
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:09,590
- Yo. "You. You. "
- You. "

860
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:10,558
"Are you. "

861
00:54:10,591 --> 00:54:11,998
"You, you. "

862
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:14,551
See, the letters make up words,
and the words make up sentences.

863
00:54:14,655 --> 00:54:15,800
"Are you. "

864
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,873
This is a little one.

865
00:54:18,911 --> 00:54:24,957
Mmm... mmm...

866
00:54:24,993 --> 00:54:27,033
Mmm, wha, wha.

867
00:54:27,073 --> 00:54:28,502
Mmm, why?

868
00:54:28,544 --> 00:54:30,552
Mmmiii... my?

869
00:54:30,593 --> 00:54:31,673
"My. My"?

870
00:54:31,713 --> 00:54:33,121
"My"!

871
00:54:33,153 --> 00:54:34,233
"Are you my. "

872
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:35,354
"Are you my. "

873
00:54:35,394 --> 00:54:36,801
Okay, one more.

874
00:54:36,834 --> 00:54:38,721
This is the toughy.

875
00:54:38,754 --> 00:54:40,794
Mmm, mmm,

876
00:54:40,834 --> 00:54:43,617
moooat, moat...

877
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:46,334
"Th", remember, thhhhh.

878
00:54:46,372 --> 00:54:49,055
Moooo, moooth,

879
00:54:49,092 --> 00:54:51,776
moooth, moooth.

880
00:54:51,812 --> 00:54:54,201
Mooth.

881
00:54:54,244 --> 00:54:57,693
Er. Er...

882
00:54:57,797 --> 00:54:59,936
Mooth er.

883
00:54:59,973 --> 00:55:03,137
Ma, ma, ma, moth.

884
00:55:03,173 --> 00:55:05,214
Moth er.

885
00:55:05,254 --> 00:55:06,334
Mo, moth er.

886
00:55:06,374 --> 00:55:07,935
"Mother"!

887
00:55:07,974 --> 00:55:08,902
"Mother"?

888
00:55:08,934 --> 00:55:09,862
- "Mother. "
- Ha!

889
00:55:09,894 --> 00:55:10,822
You did it!

890
00:55:10,854 --> 00:55:13,375
"Are you my mother?"

891
00:55:13,414 --> 00:55:14,625
I... I can read!

892
00:55:14,663 --> 00:55:16,092
Sarah, Rosella.

893
00:55:16,136 --> 00:55:17,859
- I can read.
- He can read!

894
00:55:17,896 --> 00:55:18,976
- I can read!
- He can read!

895
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:21,537
Ayy, ayy, jax.

896
00:55:21,576 --> 00:55:23,300
A- Ajax!
This is Ajax.

897
00:55:23,336 --> 00:55:24,547
Yes, it is!

898
00:55:27,177 --> 00:55:28,737
I can read!
I can read!

899
00:55:28,777 --> 00:55:30,021
What happened?

900
00:55:30,057 --> 00:55:31,267
- She taught me how to read!
- I taught Dad to read!

901
00:55:31,305 --> 00:55:32,582
This is Ajax!

902
00:55:32,617 --> 00:55:33,545
That's great!

903
00:55:33,577 --> 00:55:34,471
I can read!

904
00:55:35,594 --> 00:55:36,871
That's right!

905
00:55:44,139 --> 00:55:46,114
The door was unlocked.

906
00:55:46,156 --> 00:55:48,523
I knocked, but...

907
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,311
I can read.

908
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:52,520
Hi, Henry.

909
00:55:59,437 --> 00:56:02,285
Christ, I can't tell you
what a shock it was.

910
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:04,522
I mean, one minute
you're at the restaurant,

911
00:56:04,557 --> 00:56:06,630
the next, you know...

912
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,286
And the newspapers.

913
00:56:09,326 --> 00:56:11,880
Jesus, they never stopped
calling the office.

914
00:56:11,919 --> 00:56:14,375
Charlie was out of his mind.

915
00:56:14,415 --> 00:56:19,598
Linda... everybody.

916
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,626
Henry...

917
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,434
If they'd found
that son of a bitch,

918
00:56:27,473 --> 00:56:29,000
I'd have brought
the death penalty

919
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:32,653
back to New York
single-handedly.

920
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:36,235
Anyway.

921
00:56:38,514 --> 00:56:41,264
So, uh, here we are, huh?

922
00:56:41,299 --> 00:56:44,146
And, uh...

923
00:56:44,179 --> 00:56:48,784
we got the big party coming up.

924
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:51,723
I'm looking forward to then.

925
00:56:51,764 --> 00:56:55,060
And... I know Charlie is, too.

926
00:56:57,621 --> 00:57:00,938
W- Were we
really good friends...

927
00:57:00,982 --> 00:57:01,996
Bruce?

928
00:57:02,038 --> 00:57:04,460
Yeah.

929
00:57:04,502 --> 00:57:05,549
Oh, of course.

930
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:07,500
You know, we're... partners.

931
00:57:07,542 --> 00:57:08,972
You know.

932
00:57:12,343 --> 00:57:15,027
Mm.

933
00:57:15,063 --> 00:57:18,064
Aren't you going to open it?

934
00:57:18,104 --> 00:57:19,697
Oh, yeah.

935
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:30,393
It...

936
00:57:30,425 --> 00:57:32,313
it's a...

937
00:57:32,346 --> 00:57:34,386
You know, it's a frame, it's...

938
00:57:34,426 --> 00:57:35,888
it's just a little frame, but...

939
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:39,062
Okay. Thanks.

940
00:57:42,043 --> 00:57:44,148
"What am I going to do
with him?" Henry's Dad said.

941
00:57:44,188 --> 00:57:45,268
"I've grounded him,

942
00:57:45,308 --> 00:57:47,196
but I don't know
what to do with that boy. "

943
00:57:47,228 --> 00:57:48,472
I said, "Are you kidding?

944
00:57:48,508 --> 00:57:49,588
"Grounded him?

945
00:57:49,628 --> 00:57:51,483
I want that boy in the firm. "

946
00:57:53,789 --> 00:57:55,196
And as it turned out,

947
00:57:55,229 --> 00:57:57,782
it was the best decision
I ever made.

948
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:01,048
For years,

949
00:58:01,085 --> 00:58:03,835
the halls of our firm
have resounded with the call

950
00:58:03,902 --> 00:58:06,041
of Henry Turner throwing
on his jacket,

951
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:07,672
striding through the office,

952
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:11,060
crying, "Come on, guys, let's
go out and break some balls. "

953
00:58:12,511 --> 00:58:14,518
I offer a toast to the years
to come

954
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,316
when once more we will hear
that familiar cry.

955
00:58:16,351 --> 00:58:17,279
To Henry!

956
00:58:17,312 --> 00:58:18,326
To Henry!

957
00:58:18,368 --> 00:58:20,757
- Henry!
- To Henry!

958
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:35,906
S- Sarah... Sarah s-said
I should say something.

959
00:58:38,851 --> 00:58:42,496
Uh... I don't remember
a- any of you.

960
00:58:42,531 --> 00:58:46,842
I don't really remember

961
00:58:46,884 --> 00:58:49,699
very much of-of anything, and...

962
00:58:49,733 --> 00:58:55,963
um, it's all mixed up, um...

963
00:58:56,006 --> 00:58:57,893
Like I remember...

964
00:58:57,926 --> 00:59:00,097
um...

965
00:59:00,134 --> 00:59:04,095
that Rachel likes strawberries
on her pancakes,

966
00:59:04,135 --> 00:59:06,818
but I don't...

967
00:59:06,855 --> 00:59:09,822
remember any
of her birthday parties,

968
00:59:09,863 --> 00:59:13,212
although I saw pictures,
and I was there.

969
00:59:13,255 --> 00:59:15,143
Um...

970
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:20,261
I... I rem... remember
a woman in a blue dress

971
00:59:20,297 --> 00:59:22,184
standing on grass,

972
00:59:22,217 --> 00:59:25,381
and, um...

973
00:59:25,418 --> 00:59:29,160
I- I think that's my mother, but
I don't know if it's my mother.

974
00:59:29,194 --> 00:59:34,279
Um...

975
00:59:34,315 --> 00:59:36,682
So-so if you'll...
if you just be patient,

976
00:59:36,715 --> 00:59:39,749
I'll... I'm trying.

977
00:59:53,261 --> 00:59:56,939
And here's another one of me
as a baby.

978
01:00:01,838 --> 01:00:03,245
Wh-Who's this?

979
01:00:03,278 --> 01:00:05,482
You.

980
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:07,723
Your father used to make you
mow the lawn

981
01:00:07,759 --> 01:00:09,963
and take out the garbage
and walk the dog

982
01:00:09,999 --> 01:00:11,243
and wash the car,

983
01:00:11,279 --> 01:00:13,997
and then you learn
to appreciate the work ethic.

984
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:16,687
What's that?

985
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,109
I don't know.

986
01:00:49,172 --> 01:00:50,514
Bike.

987
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:54,228
Hi.

988
01:00:54,261 --> 01:00:55,188
Hi, Henry.

989
01:00:55,221 --> 01:00:56,301
Hi.

990
01:00:56,341 --> 01:00:57,902
- Good to see you.
- Hello.

991
01:00:57,942 --> 01:00:59,022
Hey, good to see you.

992
01:00:59,061 --> 01:01:00,622
Oh, thank you. Hi.

993
01:01:00,662 --> 01:01:01,742
- Hi, Darcy.
- Hi.

994
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:02,863
- Hello.
- Hi.

995
01:01:02,902 --> 01:01:04,309
Hi.

996
01:01:04,343 --> 01:01:05,587
It's great to see you back.

997
01:01:05,623 --> 01:01:06,703
Oh, thank you.

998
01:01:06,743 --> 01:01:07,953
You look great, Henry.

999
01:01:07,991 --> 01:01:08,919
Hi.

1000
01:01:08,951 --> 01:01:10,708
- Hello.
- Hi.

1001
01:01:10,743 --> 01:01:12,467
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back, Mr. Turner.

1002
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:13,518
Oh, thank you.

1003
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,349
Henry.

1004
01:01:15,384 --> 01:01:17,107
Hello.

1005
01:01:17,145 --> 01:01:18,389
I'm Rudy.

1006
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:19,504
Ruuuu-dy.

1007
01:01:19,545 --> 01:01:23,822
I just want to say hello
and welcome back.

1008
01:01:23,866 --> 01:01:25,688
What's wrong with him?

1009
01:01:25,722 --> 01:01:26,966
- He's an asshole.
- Oh.

1010
01:01:27,002 --> 01:01:27,930
Henry.

1011
01:01:27,962 --> 01:01:29,042
Hi.

1012
01:01:29,082 --> 01:01:30,489
It's Linda.

1013
01:01:30,522 --> 01:01:31,766
Hi, Linda.

1014
01:01:31,803 --> 01:01:34,192
It's good to see you
back at the office.

1015
01:01:34,234 --> 01:01:36,885
It's good to see you, too.

1016
01:01:36,923 --> 01:01:39,257
Linda.

1017
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:41,364
Linda...

1018
01:01:41,404 --> 01:01:43,793
This is your office.

1019
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:49,686
And this is...

1020
01:01:49,725 --> 01:01:50,805
Jessica.

1021
01:01:50,845 --> 01:01:52,733
Jessica.
She was your secretary.

1022
01:01:52,765 --> 01:01:55,581
And she was working for Steven
while you were away.

1023
01:01:56,766 --> 01:01:57,879
Nice flower.

1024
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:00,859
Thank you.

1025
01:02:02,207 --> 01:02:03,636
Wow.

1026
01:02:12,256 --> 01:02:14,329
I'm at the end of the hall
if you need anything.

1027
01:02:14,368 --> 01:02:18,013
Okay, well, I'll be in here
if you need anything.

1028
01:02:18,113 --> 01:02:19,607
Let's grab lunch this week.

1029
01:02:19,649 --> 01:02:20,893
Okay.

1030
01:02:20,929 --> 01:02:22,838
He's back.

1031
01:02:22,882 --> 01:02:24,343
Grab lunch?

1032
01:02:24,386 --> 01:02:26,273
Grab lunch...

1033
01:02:26,306 --> 01:02:28,379
Grab lunch.

1034
01:02:35,907 --> 01:02:40,697
Matthews v.
East Shore Hospital.

1035
01:02:45,188 --> 01:02:46,432
Mmm.

1036
01:02:46,469 --> 01:02:48,705
Say when.

1037
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:59,076
When you've had enough,
Mr. Turner, you say "when. "

1038
01:03:01,031 --> 01:03:02,918
Oh, when.

1039
01:03:13,225 --> 01:03:16,356
You want anything
from the kitchen?

1040
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:19,143
Um, thanks, I'm okay.

1041
01:03:21,514 --> 01:03:24,416
A little milk and cookies?

1042
01:03:24,457 --> 01:03:25,952
Mallomars?

1043
01:03:25,994 --> 01:03:29,224
Uh, no, I just,
I have to finish reading this.

1044
01:03:29,258 --> 01:03:31,811
You don't remember mallomars,
do you?

1045
01:03:31,915 --> 01:03:34,337
No.

1046
01:03:34,379 --> 01:03:36,038
Marshmallows in chocolate?

1047
01:03:37,068 --> 01:03:39,654
I once watched you eat
a whole package

1048
01:03:39,692 --> 01:03:41,634
in three and a half minutes.

1049
01:03:41,677 --> 01:03:44,524
Okay, I'll have some mallomars.

1050
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:49,829
Buddy... sit.

1051
01:03:55,886 --> 01:03:57,162
So we push for October.

1052
01:03:57,198 --> 01:03:58,540
We can go to trial then.

1053
01:03:58,574 --> 01:04:00,614
What about Lawson?

1054
01:04:00,686 --> 01:04:01,930
He's on the Barnes case.

1055
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:03,145
How long can that take?

1056
01:04:03,183 --> 01:04:04,296
Lawson? Try a decade.

1057
01:04:04,335 --> 01:04:05,263
What did he say?

1058
01:04:05,295 --> 01:04:06,375
Nothing that helped us.

1059
01:04:06,447 --> 01:04:08,586
I'm telling you,
we've got to make a choice.

1060
01:04:08,624 --> 01:04:09,572
What, do we postpone?

1061
01:04:09,616 --> 01:04:11,111
We can't push this off forever.

1062
01:04:11,152 --> 01:04:12,941
Listen, either we get it
or we don't.

1063
01:04:12,976 --> 01:04:14,765
There's a phone call
to be made here.

1064
01:04:14,801 --> 01:04:18,184
If we lose Rodgers, half a dozen
other clients will follow.

1065
01:04:18,225 --> 01:04:20,647
We can't lose his case
because of Barnes.

1066
01:04:20,689 --> 01:04:22,991
So we go with September
with another witness.

1067
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,814
Exactly. We'll pull
a Henry Turner.

1068
01:04:29,459 --> 01:04:30,735
Hey, it's really decent of you

1069
01:04:30,771 --> 01:04:32,876
to let Henry come back
like this.

1070
01:04:32,915 --> 01:04:34,093
Well, after all...

1071
01:04:34,131 --> 01:04:36,073
we're human, aren't we?

1072
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:38,635
Is-is there more on-on

1073
01:04:38,676 --> 01:04:41,775
Matthews v. East Shore
Hospital?

1074
01:04:41,812 --> 01:04:44,878
That would be in the file room.

1075
01:04:44,917 --> 01:04:46,640
I'll get the file.

1076
01:04:46,741 --> 01:04:48,050
Okay, I'll wait here.

1077
01:04:48,085 --> 01:04:50,125
Uh...

1078
01:04:50,165 --> 01:04:52,020
you can wait in your office.

1079
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:53,548
I'll bring it to you.

1080
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:56,656
Okay, I'll wait in my office.

1081
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:00,052
He's going to Paul Weiss?

1082
01:05:00,087 --> 01:05:02,226
They offered him 650
and a partnership.

1083
01:05:02,263 --> 01:05:03,278
What would you do?

1084
01:05:03,319 --> 01:05:05,142
Well, I'd have
to see the office.

1085
01:05:05,175 --> 01:05:06,288
Oh, yeah.

1086
01:05:06,327 --> 01:05:08,084
Welcome back, Mr. Turner.

1087
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,047
Oh, hi.

1088
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:11,731
Listen, I've got this question.

1089
01:05:11,769 --> 01:05:12,696
What is it?

1090
01:05:12,729 --> 01:05:14,671
Um... uh... in this case.

1091
01:05:14,712 --> 01:05:15,890
Which one?

1092
01:05:15,929 --> 01:05:16,943
M- Matthews.

1093
01:05:16,985 --> 01:05:20,629
East Shore Hospital,
your famous last case.

1094
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:23,700
Yeah, yeah, we said that
the hospital wasn't responsible

1095
01:05:23,738 --> 01:05:26,805
because Mr. Matthews didn't
tell them he was a diabetic.

1096
01:05:26,842 --> 01:05:28,336
Yeah, that was the argument.

1097
01:05:28,379 --> 01:05:30,037
The hospital wasn't responsible

1098
01:05:30,074 --> 01:05:32,017
because they didn't know
the guy was on insulin.

1099
01:05:32,059 --> 01:05:37,843
Yeah, but, look, um... in this
file, um, this... other patient,

1100
01:05:37,884 --> 01:05:39,957
uh, Miss McNair,

1101
01:05:39,996 --> 01:05:42,200
uh, said that
she heard Mr. Matthews, uh

1102
01:05:42,237 --> 01:05:44,277
tell the nurse he was diabetic,

1103
01:05:44,317 --> 01:05:46,259
but-but she didn't
write it down.

1104
01:05:46,301 --> 01:05:50,098
Um, so... um, we, we're saying
they're not responsible but,

1105
01:05:50,141 --> 01:05:53,622
but we didn't tell them
about this lady's statement.

1106
01:05:53,662 --> 01:05:54,645
So what?

1107
01:05:54,686 --> 01:05:56,508
Come on, Henry.
Put it away.

1108
01:05:56,543 --> 01:05:58,103
Put it back in the file.

1109
01:05:58,143 --> 01:06:01,209
But, so...

1110
01:06:03,456 --> 01:06:05,823
What we did was wrong.

1111
01:06:05,855 --> 01:06:09,500
What we did is paying
for our lunch.

1112
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,424
So everything's okay?

1113
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:14,368
So everything's okay?

1114
01:06:14,402 --> 01:06:15,646
Still love me?

1115
01:06:15,681 --> 01:06:17,623
Yeah. When are you coming home?

1116
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:19,870
Uh, I'll be home by dinner.

1117
01:06:19,906 --> 01:06:22,078
Don't spoil your appetite.

1118
01:06:22,114 --> 01:06:25,344
Okay, you, too. Bye-bye.

1119
01:06:25,379 --> 01:06:28,828
"Mix until... creamy.

1120
01:06:28,868 --> 01:06:34,466
"Drop... spoonfuls on...

1121
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:38,145
greas-ed... cookie sheet. "

1122
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,286
Let's make one big cookie.

1123
01:06:40,325 --> 01:06:41,951
You can't.
It doesn't cook.

1124
01:06:41,989 --> 01:06:42,971
I tried it once.

1125
01:06:43,014 --> 01:06:44,672
Oh.

1126
01:06:52,134 --> 01:06:55,997
Were you scared...
at the hospital?

1127
01:06:56,039 --> 01:06:58,527
Um...
at first, yeah.

1128
01:06:58,568 --> 01:07:01,884
But then it got okay, right?

1129
01:07:01,992 --> 01:07:04,480
Yeah, then it got okay.

1130
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,822
'Cause I start school soon.

1131
01:07:06,857 --> 01:07:09,061
Sleep-away.

1132
01:07:09,096 --> 01:07:11,486
What-what do you mean?

1133
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:14,311
I'm going away.

1134
01:07:14,346 --> 01:07:15,273
Wh...?

1135
01:07:15,306 --> 01:07:19,398
Well, no... no one... told me.

1136
01:07:21,194 --> 01:07:23,616
Are you scared?

1137
01:07:25,483 --> 01:07:27,785
Do you still want me to go?

1138
01:07:27,819 --> 01:07:28,768
Me? No, I...

1139
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:31,659
No, I-I, no.

1140
01:07:31,692 --> 01:07:32,902
Really, 'cause I could,

1141
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:34,664
I could go to school
around here.

1142
01:07:34,701 --> 01:07:38,662
Well, I don't want you
to go anywhere, but...

1143
01:07:40,077 --> 01:07:43,012
I'm not sure it's up to me.

1144
01:07:43,053 --> 01:07:44,711
Is it up to me?

1145
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:52,104
Well, look,
I'll-I'll talk to Mom, okay?

1146
01:07:52,143 --> 01:07:54,347
Okay.

1147
01:07:54,383 --> 01:07:56,358
Okay.

1148
01:07:56,399 --> 01:07:59,661
Maybe she could... stay home,

1149
01:07:59,696 --> 01:08:02,063
and-and go to school
somewhere around here.

1150
01:08:02,096 --> 01:08:03,623
It's what we agreed on.

1151
01:08:03,665 --> 01:08:06,087
That school only takes
30 kids a year,

1152
01:08:06,129 --> 01:08:07,787
and Rachel's one of them.

1153
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:14,952
There's got to be a few things

1154
01:08:14,993 --> 01:08:17,415
that we decided
that I can count on.

1155
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:21,288
It's a great opportunity
for her.

1156
01:08:21,331 --> 01:08:23,153
And for us.

1157
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:26,411
I think it's important.

1158
01:08:29,908 --> 01:08:32,079
I...

1159
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:34,253
I saw a house today.

1160
01:08:34,292 --> 01:08:36,397
A place I think'd be
much better for us.

1161
01:08:36,437 --> 01:08:38,292
It's so big here,
don't you think?

1162
01:08:40,181 --> 01:08:42,964
I found someone who wants
to buy this apartment.

1163
01:08:42,997 --> 01:08:44,972
And I want to show you
this house.

1164
01:08:49,495 --> 01:08:51,502
You think we should move?

1165
01:08:52,983 --> 01:08:54,358
I do.

1166
01:08:57,816 --> 01:09:01,711
And you think Rachel
should go a-away to school?

1167
01:09:03,064 --> 01:09:04,493
Yeah.

1168
01:09:09,977 --> 01:09:12,246
Okay.

1169
01:09:37,597 --> 01:09:39,004
Oh...

1170
01:09:39,037 --> 01:09:40,925
Hi, Rachel.

1171
01:09:40,957 --> 01:09:42,332
Hi, Jennifer.

1172
01:09:42,365 --> 01:09:44,188
Sweetheart.

1173
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:46,110
This is
a wonderful school.

1174
01:09:46,143 --> 01:09:49,012
And see, you already
have a friend here.

1175
01:09:49,055 --> 01:09:50,516
I hate Jennifer.

1176
01:09:50,559 --> 01:09:53,854
You're going to meet all sorts
of very nice girls.

1177
01:09:53,887 --> 01:09:55,032
I don't think so.

1178
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:57,144
Of course, you are.

1179
01:09:57,184 --> 01:09:58,428
Honey.

1180
01:09:58,496 --> 01:10:02,206
One of the things I do remember

1181
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,721
is-is my first day at school.

1182
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,503
There were all these...
weird-looking kids,

1183
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,425
and I didn't know any of them,

1184
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:14,622
and they didn't know me,
I was-I was scared.

1185
01:10:14,658 --> 01:10:17,113
But after two days,

1186
01:10:17,154 --> 01:10:21,727
we were all laughing
about-about how scared we were.

1187
01:10:21,763 --> 01:10:25,954
Everybody feels like you do,
honey, everybody.

1188
01:10:29,124 --> 01:10:31,459
Take care of Buddy.

1189
01:10:31,492 --> 01:10:32,801
I will.

1190
01:10:32,837 --> 01:10:36,034
Try and teach him
how to sit, okay?

1191
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:36,963
Okay.

1192
01:10:39,077 --> 01:10:41,761
Well...

1193
01:10:41,798 --> 01:10:44,219
you don't want
to miss orientation.

1194
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:52,862
Henry. That's great.

1195
01:10:52,904 --> 01:10:54,791
I didn't know you
remembered your school.

1196
01:10:56,584 --> 01:10:58,657
I don't.

1197
01:11:38,382 --> 01:11:40,008
Hey.

1198
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:42,250
How you doing?

1199
01:11:42,286 --> 01:11:44,839
Hmm. I miss her.

1200
01:11:44,878 --> 01:11:47,180
Mmm...

1201
01:11:48,911 --> 01:11:51,878
Me, too.

1202
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,971
We'll see her on Parent's Day.

1203
01:12:02,065 --> 01:12:04,880
Look, there's Cassiopeia.

1204
01:12:04,914 --> 01:12:09,704
And...

1205
01:12:09,746 --> 01:12:12,648
there's the Big Dripper.

1206
01:12:12,691 --> 01:12:15,473
And the Little Dripper.

1207
01:12:17,715 --> 01:12:19,144
Hmm.

1208
01:12:19,187 --> 01:12:21,162
So strange,
the things I remember.

1209
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:33,610
Is this okay?

1210
01:12:33,653 --> 01:12:35,825
Yeah.

1211
01:12:39,094 --> 01:12:43,120
You know,
since you've come home,

1212
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:45,046
we haven't made love.

1213
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:51,862
I mean, if you're nervous
or something,

1214
01:12:51,896 --> 01:12:53,805
we could talk about it.

1215
01:12:53,848 --> 01:12:57,623
Well, yeah,
I'm a little... nervous.

1216
01:12:57,656 --> 01:13:01,748
Um, okay, well, re...

1217
01:13:03,225 --> 01:13:05,364
Really nervous.

1218
01:13:06,394 --> 01:13:08,761
Very nervous.

1219
01:13:08,793 --> 01:13:10,320
Why?

1220
01:13:10,362 --> 01:13:12,915
Well, um...

1221
01:13:12,954 --> 01:13:15,769
I don't know, I...

1222
01:13:16,891 --> 01:13:19,761
Look, I saw...

1223
01:13:19,804 --> 01:13:21,527
I saw this movie, and...

1224
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:26,136
Well, I don't know if-if I can
do it like that guy did it.

1225
01:13:29,052 --> 01:13:30,841
Here.

1226
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:40,343
Touch me.

1227
01:14:29,989 --> 01:14:31,418
Sarah?

1228
01:14:31,461 --> 01:14:33,184
Mm-hmm?

1229
01:14:33,222 --> 01:14:35,644
Tell me how we met.

1230
01:14:41,255 --> 01:14:43,524
Uh...

1231
01:14:43,559 --> 01:14:48,578
it was at Chris Liner's
birthday party.

1232
01:14:48,615 --> 01:14:52,806
You were a hot, young lawyer,

1233
01:14:52,904 --> 01:14:58,949
and I was answering phones
at Harper's Bazaar.

1234
01:14:58,985 --> 01:15:02,498
I was standing in the doorway
smoking a cigarette...

1235
01:15:02,538 --> 01:15:04,425
back when I used to smoke...

1236
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:10,242
and you just came up to me.

1237
01:15:10,282 --> 01:15:14,341
"I'm Henry," you said,
"and you're beautiful. "

1238
01:15:15,883 --> 01:15:19,298
I did?

1239
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:23,399
That made me completely
self-conscious.

1240
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:29,133
You had such confidence,
you just drew me in.

1241
01:15:29,165 --> 01:15:31,435
We talked for hours.

1242
01:15:31,469 --> 01:15:33,412
Ignored everyone.

1243
01:15:33,454 --> 01:15:36,967
And then the girl
you were with got mad

1244
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:38,663
and wanted to go.

1245
01:15:38,702 --> 01:15:40,229
And as you left,

1246
01:15:40,271 --> 01:15:43,370
you handed me your card
and said,

1247
01:15:43,407 --> 01:15:46,222
"Have you ever eaten blowfish?

1248
01:15:46,255 --> 01:15:50,663
'Cause I know this great
blowfish place. "

1249
01:15:55,985 --> 01:15:59,214
It made me laugh...

1250
01:16:01,458 --> 01:16:03,662
and I went home
and told my roommate

1251
01:16:03,697 --> 01:16:06,218
I'd met the man
I was going to marry.

1252
01:16:43,255 --> 01:16:45,524
I like it.

1253
01:17:00,218 --> 01:17:01,778
Hey, watch where you're walking.

1254
01:17:03,514 --> 01:17:06,897
...in the living room,
next to the couch.

1255
01:17:06,938 --> 01:17:09,360
We'll get to keep the dining
room table, right?

1256
01:17:09,403 --> 01:17:10,580
Right, right.

1257
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:11,895
Okay.

1258
01:17:11,931 --> 01:17:13,557
What?

1259
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:15,122
Does this bother you?

1260
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:16,309
No.

1261
01:17:16,348 --> 01:17:18,453
Then why are you looking
at me like that?

1262
01:17:18,492 --> 01:17:21,558
Because you never
used to hold my hand.

1263
01:17:21,628 --> 01:17:23,483
Oh.

1264
01:17:23,517 --> 01:17:25,339
You didn't like showing
affection in public.

1265
01:17:25,373 --> 01:17:26,453
It bothered you.

1266
01:17:26,493 --> 01:17:27,421
Why?

1267
01:17:27,453 --> 01:17:28,697
I don't know why.

1268
01:17:28,733 --> 01:17:30,195
You don't know why?

1269
01:17:30,269 --> 01:17:31,731
No.

1270
01:17:31,773 --> 01:17:33,083
Me, either.

1271
01:17:35,262 --> 01:17:36,374
What are you doing?

1272
01:17:36,414 --> 01:17:37,341
Come up here.

1273
01:17:37,374 --> 01:17:38,552
Henry, what?

1274
01:17:38,590 --> 01:17:40,019
Come here.

1275
01:17:40,062 --> 01:17:43,412
I don't mind so much anymore.

1276
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:46,455
Sarah?

1277
01:17:46,496 --> 01:17:49,660
Phyllis, hi.

1278
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,215
Hi.

1279
01:17:52,321 --> 01:17:54,263
I thought that was you.

1280
01:17:54,304 --> 01:17:55,865
Hello, Henry.

1281
01:17:55,905 --> 01:17:57,334
Hi.

1282
01:17:57,377 --> 01:17:58,938
This is Phyllis and Daniel.

1283
01:17:58,977 --> 01:18:00,636
They were at Charlie's party.

1284
01:18:00,673 --> 01:18:02,200
Hello, Phyllis and Daniel.

1285
01:18:02,241 --> 01:18:03,583
Henry.

1286
01:18:03,618 --> 01:18:06,815
Well, um, no, I,
I was going to call you,

1287
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:09,884
because, I'm having
a- a housewarming on the 20th.

1288
01:18:09,922 --> 01:18:11,417
I'd love it if you'd come.

1289
01:18:11,459 --> 01:18:12,670
Okay.

1290
01:18:12,707 --> 01:18:14,944
Okay, thanks.

1291
01:18:14,979 --> 01:18:17,467
All right, then, uh, we'll talk.

1292
01:18:17,508 --> 01:18:19,548
It's good to see you.

1293
01:18:19,588 --> 01:18:21,443
I'll call you.

1294
01:18:21,477 --> 01:18:22,938
Big kiss.

1295
01:18:22,981 --> 01:18:24,956
Okay.

1296
01:18:43,112 --> 01:18:48,295
Jessica, I'd like to see the
file on Stephenson v. Murray.

1297
01:18:49,896 --> 01:18:51,806
I'm sorry, Mr. Turner, I can't.

1298
01:18:51,849 --> 01:18:54,664
How come?

1299
01:18:57,289 --> 01:19:01,796
I'm not allowed to give you
any more of your old case files.

1300
01:19:13,739 --> 01:19:16,292
No one can believe
what you've done.

1301
01:19:16,332 --> 01:19:19,015
I just moved in
everything that I love.

1302
01:19:19,052 --> 01:19:20,394
It's amazing.

1303
01:19:20,428 --> 01:19:22,665
I said, "I don't even want to
see swatches for six months. "

1304
01:19:22,701 --> 01:19:23,781
You're kidding me.

1305
01:19:23,821 --> 01:19:25,676
I mean, it looks like
you've lived here forever.

1306
01:19:25,709 --> 01:19:27,303
Just all my old
favorite things.

1307
01:19:27,341 --> 01:19:28,356
A hundred?

1308
01:19:28,397 --> 01:19:30,339
I think this is the nicest
house you've ever had.

1309
01:19:30,382 --> 01:19:32,902
I agree.
I feel like I'm home.

1310
01:19:34,926 --> 01:19:35,854
Hi.

1311
01:19:35,919 --> 01:19:37,196
Hello, darling.
How's Henry?

1312
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:38,344
Oh, he's fine, he's here.

1313
01:19:38,383 --> 01:19:39,332
Marvelous.

1314
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:45,032
Seven brothers
and sisters, huh?

1315
01:19:45,071 --> 01:19:45,999
That's right.

1316
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:47,242
Is it really hot in Memphis?

1317
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,208
Very hot.

1318
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:49,834
Hey, how you doing?

1319
01:19:49,872 --> 01:19:52,327
Well, these little ones
are really good.

1320
01:19:52,369 --> 01:19:54,824
But that lady over there
in the gold dress

1321
01:19:54,865 --> 01:19:56,459
thinks they're a disaster.

1322
01:19:56,497 --> 01:19:58,832
And that other woman
n- near the window?

1323
01:19:58,865 --> 01:20:00,272
Mm-hmm?

1324
01:20:00,306 --> 01:20:01,713
Just had her face done.

1325
01:20:01,746 --> 01:20:03,568
Not her neck, just her eyes.

1326
01:20:03,602 --> 01:20:07,345
And that other man
used to be her husband,

1327
01:20:07,379 --> 01:20:10,696
but who is she kidding,
the damage is done.

1328
01:20:13,235 --> 01:20:14,163
Such a shame.

1329
01:20:14,196 --> 01:20:15,144
I mean, he was so good.

1330
01:20:15,187 --> 01:20:16,267
He really was.

1331
01:20:16,308 --> 01:20:18,315
Henry represented my cousin
three years ago.

1332
01:20:18,356 --> 01:20:19,883
He was the best, the best.

1333
01:20:19,925 --> 01:20:21,551
Everybody was terrified of him.

1334
01:20:21,589 --> 01:20:23,596
Of course,
I've known Sarah forever.

1335
01:20:23,637 --> 01:20:25,263
I heard he's back at work.

1336
01:20:25,301 --> 01:20:26,828
Yeah, but doing what?

1337
01:20:26,869 --> 01:20:30,131
Getting paid for doing nothing
doesn't sound so bad, does it?

1338
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:32,337
It's not Henry I feel sorry for,
it's Sarah.

1339
01:20:32,374 --> 01:20:34,032
It's like
she's got two kids now.

1340
01:20:34,071 --> 01:20:35,412
Worse! What does
she possibly have

1341
01:20:35,447 --> 01:20:36,429
to look forward to?

1342
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:37,518
It is such a shame.

1343
01:20:37,559 --> 01:20:39,021
Christ, one minute
you're an attorney,

1344
01:20:39,063 --> 01:20:40,143
the next, you're an imbecile.

1345
01:20:40,183 --> 01:20:42,256
That's not a very long trip.

1346
01:20:47,896 --> 01:20:53,593
Phyllis, I am afraid we, uh,
we can't stay for dinner.

1347
01:20:53,625 --> 01:20:55,120
I just wanted
to say goodnight.

1348
01:20:55,161 --> 01:20:56,503
Thank you.

1349
01:21:00,506 --> 01:21:01,968
Shit!

1350
01:21:20,221 --> 01:21:23,800
You can't let them
hurt you, those people.

1351
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:27,285
They don't know you anymore.

1352
01:21:27,326 --> 01:21:29,781
Darling...

1353
01:21:29,822 --> 01:21:33,238
I'm not going to work today.

1354
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:47,001
Sit.

1355
01:22:01,315 --> 01:22:02,559
Henry.

1356
01:22:02,595 --> 01:22:05,214
I invited someone over.

1357
01:22:11,876 --> 01:22:14,495
Bradley.

1358
01:22:20,165 --> 01:22:22,238
Oh, dinner.

1359
01:22:22,278 --> 01:22:24,253
Thanks.

1360
01:22:35,848 --> 01:22:38,117
So... what's up?

1361
01:22:42,505 --> 01:22:47,775
I thought I could go back
to my life, but...

1362
01:22:47,817 --> 01:22:51,396
I don't like
who I was, Bradley.

1363
01:22:51,434 --> 01:22:54,434
I- I don't fit in.

1364
01:22:59,627 --> 01:23:01,700
I got bad knees.

1365
01:23:01,739 --> 01:23:03,779
What?

1366
01:23:03,819 --> 01:23:05,412
My knees, they're bad.

1367
01:23:05,452 --> 01:23:07,307
Ask me why.

1368
01:23:07,339 --> 01:23:09,511
Why?

1369
01:23:09,548 --> 01:23:11,075
Football.

1370
01:23:11,117 --> 01:23:13,484
Wrecked them both
playing college football.

1371
01:23:13,517 --> 01:23:17,379
Man, it was my life.

1372
01:23:17,421 --> 01:23:19,309
Football, what else was there?

1373
01:23:19,373 --> 01:23:21,381
Not jack shit.

1374
01:23:21,422 --> 01:23:23,811
Homecoming, right?

1375
01:23:23,854 --> 01:23:26,724
That son of a bitch
threw a perfect spiral,

1376
01:23:26,767 --> 01:23:29,931
and I caught it... boom.

1377
01:23:29,967 --> 01:23:31,724
Right out of the sky.

1378
01:23:31,792 --> 01:23:33,734
I had the moment.

1379
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:38,348
When that safety hit me,
and I felt my knees pop,

1380
01:23:38,384 --> 01:23:40,751
I knew that was it.

1381
01:23:40,785 --> 01:23:42,443
Game over. Forget it.

1382
01:23:42,481 --> 01:23:44,903
I was dead.

1383
01:23:44,945 --> 01:23:46,832
My life was over, Hank.

1384
01:23:49,714 --> 01:23:53,576
Now ask me if I mind
having bad knees?

1385
01:23:53,619 --> 01:23:55,441
Do you mind...?

1386
01:23:55,475 --> 01:23:57,515
No. No way.

1387
01:23:57,555 --> 01:23:59,977
It was a test.

1388
01:24:00,019 --> 01:24:03,598
I had to find a life.

1389
01:24:05,364 --> 01:24:07,568
The therapist that
helped me walk again?

1390
01:24:07,604 --> 01:24:08,848
He was so cool.

1391
01:24:08,885 --> 01:24:12,530
I thought, "That's
what I want to do. "

1392
01:24:12,565 --> 01:24:16,046
When I told some of my buddies,
they laughed right in my face.

1393
01:24:16,085 --> 01:24:17,198
Called me a nurse.

1394
01:24:17,237 --> 01:24:19,245
Bought me white dresses
and shit.

1395
01:24:19,286 --> 01:24:23,061
But check it out.

1396
01:24:23,094 --> 01:24:25,549
You're walking.

1397
01:24:25,591 --> 01:24:27,249
You're talking.

1398
01:24:27,286 --> 01:24:30,735
You're sitting here drinking
some pretty expensive damn beer.

1399
01:24:30,775 --> 01:24:32,663
I had something
to do with that.

1400
01:24:32,695 --> 01:24:35,827
If it weren't for my knees,
I'd never have met you.

1401
01:24:35,864 --> 01:24:40,240
So no, I don't mind
having bad knees, no.

1402
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:43,445
Let me tell you something, Hank.

1403
01:24:43,481 --> 01:24:47,508
Don't listen to nobody
trying to tell you who you are.

1404
01:24:47,578 --> 01:24:53,143
It might take a while,
but you'll figure yourself out.

1405
01:24:57,339 --> 01:24:59,347
Thanks.

1406
01:25:12,861 --> 01:25:16,058
It'd be a great story
if we'd won the game.

1407
01:25:21,470 --> 01:25:24,886
Yeah, hi, this is
Rachel Turner's father.

1408
01:25:24,927 --> 01:25:27,709
I want to talk
to Rachel, please.

1409
01:25:27,743 --> 01:25:32,151
Well, I'm not sure
it's an emergency,

1410
01:25:32,192 --> 01:25:35,672
but I just got this letter
from her, and she's...

1411
01:25:35,712 --> 01:25:37,272
m- miserable.

1412
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:43,232
Yeah, but she just sounds
so sad.

1413
01:25:43,265 --> 01:25:45,753
I just thought I could,
I don't know,

1414
01:25:45,794 --> 01:25:49,023
cheer her up
a little or something.

1415
01:25:49,058 --> 01:25:53,182
Yeah, I see. Uh-huh.

1416
01:25:53,219 --> 01:25:55,106
Okay, yeah.

1417
01:25:55,139 --> 01:25:57,528
I'll-I'll call back,
um, after 6:00.

1418
01:25:57,603 --> 01:25:59,938
Thank you.

1419
01:25:59,971 --> 01:26:02,874
This is for you, Mr. Henry.

1420
01:26:02,916 --> 01:26:04,345
Oh.

1421
01:26:04,388 --> 01:26:06,494
Thanks.

1422
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:12,448
I'm going to miss you,
Mr. Henry.

1423
01:26:12,485 --> 01:26:15,235
I like you
much better now.

1424
01:26:31,688 --> 01:26:35,300
"Enjoy your new home.

1425
01:26:35,336 --> 01:26:39,777
Your friend and partner, Bruce. "

1426
01:27:21,774 --> 01:27:29,478
"Sarah, I need you... now.

1427
01:27:29,519 --> 01:27:32,203
"Feel you...

1428
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,476
"against me.

1429
01:27:36,401 --> 01:27:37,994
"Call me tonight.

1430
01:27:43,121 --> 01:27:45,423
Bruce. "

1431
01:27:45,458 --> 01:27:48,273
Henry, you back here?

1432
01:27:50,386 --> 01:27:51,728
We closed.

1433
01:27:51,827 --> 01:27:53,037
It's ours.

1434
01:27:53,075 --> 01:27:55,180
The house
is officially ours.

1435
01:27:59,188 --> 01:28:01,871
Oh, God.

1436
01:28:01,908 --> 01:28:03,631
Oh, my God.

1437
01:28:03,668 --> 01:28:05,773
Henry.

1438
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:08,813
It happened before?

1439
01:28:12,629 --> 01:28:14,931
Oh, God, please...

1440
01:28:19,702 --> 01:28:21,742
Before I was shot?

1441
01:28:21,783 --> 01:28:23,670
You slept with Bruce before?

1442
01:28:23,703 --> 01:28:26,965
It didn't last.

1443
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,750
He kept writing to me,
but it didn't last.

1444
01:28:29,784 --> 01:28:32,687
Everything was different.

1445
01:28:32,728 --> 01:28:34,638
You were different.

1446
01:28:34,681 --> 01:28:36,241
I don't remember
what I was like, Sarah!

1447
01:28:36,281 --> 01:28:38,615
Listen to me.

1448
01:28:38,649 --> 01:28:40,143
Don't walk away.

1449
01:28:40,185 --> 01:28:42,193
We were miserable.

1450
01:28:42,233 --> 01:28:44,951
You don't remember,
but I do.

1451
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:47,026
I was lonely.

1452
01:28:51,899 --> 01:28:54,387
We were in love once,
years ago,

1453
01:28:54,427 --> 01:28:56,794
and then we weren't,
not for a long time.

1454
01:28:56,827 --> 01:29:00,472
But we're better now.

1455
01:29:00,508 --> 01:29:02,451
Please don't walk away.

1456
01:29:02,492 --> 01:29:05,788
Not now.

1457
01:29:15,902 --> 01:29:18,171
Well, I would like to.

1458
01:29:18,206 --> 01:29:19,930
Could you do that?

1459
01:29:19,967 --> 01:29:21,691
You could?

1460
01:29:21,727 --> 01:29:23,800
I think that would be
perfect.

1461
01:29:25,407 --> 01:29:27,263
Wait a minute,
I'll call you back.

1462
01:29:40,930 --> 01:29:42,174
Please.

1463
01:29:42,209 --> 01:29:43,616
Please.

1464
01:29:43,650 --> 01:29:45,308
Talk to me.

1465
01:29:53,572 --> 01:29:55,481
Taxi!

1466
01:30:07,813 --> 01:30:09,243
Afternoon.

1467
01:30:52,395 --> 01:30:53,639
I followed you.

1468
01:30:53,675 --> 01:30:55,082
Bruce doesn't know I'm here.

1469
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:58,913
Look, I...
I don't have anything to say.

1470
01:30:58,956 --> 01:31:01,324
I think we should talk.

1471
01:31:01,356 --> 01:31:03,429
Well, I don't.

1472
01:31:03,468 --> 01:31:05,291
Bruce was right,
you are different.

1473
01:31:06,797 --> 01:31:08,739
You shouldn't take it all out
on him.

1474
01:31:08,781 --> 01:31:10,505
He's been a good friend to you.

1475
01:31:10,541 --> 01:31:13,095
After the accident,
Bruce took over your cases.

1476
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:14,378
He took care of things.

1477
01:31:14,414 --> 01:31:15,975
He sure did.

1478
01:31:16,079 --> 01:31:18,086
Bruce is so humiliated.

1479
01:31:18,126 --> 01:31:19,556
He's humiliated?

1480
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:23,341
Look, Linda, I know Bruce
is a friend of yours and I...

1481
01:31:23,375 --> 01:31:26,059
I know that you mean well,
but this...

1482
01:31:26,096 --> 01:31:28,431
this is not a good time for me.

1483
01:31:28,464 --> 01:31:30,952
Henry this isn't any fun
for me either.

1484
01:31:30,993 --> 01:31:32,619
What are you talking about?

1485
01:31:33,617 --> 01:31:35,886
I'm talking about us.

1486
01:31:35,921 --> 01:31:39,500
You're not the only one
who lost in this.

1487
01:31:39,538 --> 01:31:41,611
I lost, too.

1488
01:31:42,578 --> 01:31:46,058
I lost the one man I ever loved.

1489
01:31:46,099 --> 01:31:47,986
And it was you, Henry.

1490
01:31:51,316 --> 01:31:55,823
It's hard to see you every day
in the office...

1491
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:58,414
and you don't know me.

1492
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:03,661
This was our hotel.

1493
01:32:03,701 --> 01:32:07,279
Every Tuesday and Thursday
at the Ritz.

1494
01:32:07,318 --> 01:32:10,351
But...

1495
01:32:12,439 --> 01:32:15,406
Ritz.

1496
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:18,000
You were going to leave Sarah
for me.

1497
01:32:18,039 --> 01:32:20,079
And now it's gone.

1498
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:22,837
No...
It's all gone.

1499
01:32:26,136 --> 01:32:28,340
Henry?

1500
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:30,132
No...

1501
01:34:18,887 --> 01:34:20,611
Mrs. Matthews?

1502
01:34:20,647 --> 01:34:22,371
May I help...?

1503
01:34:22,407 --> 01:34:24,513
What are you doing here?

1504
01:34:25,512 --> 01:34:28,163
You remember me.

1505
01:34:28,201 --> 01:34:32,292
We remember you,
Mr. Turner.

1506
01:34:32,329 --> 01:34:34,369
I came to apologize.

1507
01:34:34,409 --> 01:34:36,133
Are you kidding me?

1508
01:34:36,169 --> 01:34:38,079
No, I'm serious.

1509
01:34:38,121 --> 01:34:39,299
Um...

1510
01:34:44,650 --> 01:34:46,822
Just give that to your lawyer.

1511
01:34:46,858 --> 01:34:49,444
What's this?

1512
01:34:50,443 --> 01:34:53,193
Your husband did tell the nurse

1513
01:34:53,227 --> 01:34:55,529
that-that he was diabetic.

1514
01:34:55,564 --> 01:34:57,604
It-it's all in there.

1515
01:34:59,469 --> 01:35:01,356
I'm sorry.

1516
01:35:01,389 --> 01:35:03,113
Why?

1517
01:35:03,149 --> 01:35:04,710
I changed.

1518
01:35:04,749 --> 01:35:07,400
I guess.

1519
01:35:07,437 --> 01:35:09,412
Bye.

1520
01:35:26,736 --> 01:35:27,751
Hi, Ann.

1521
01:35:27,792 --> 01:35:29,199
Mr. Turner,
he's in a meeting.

1522
01:35:29,233 --> 01:35:31,502
It's okay.

1523
01:35:31,537 --> 01:35:32,715
Got to go.

1524
01:35:32,753 --> 01:35:34,346
Jesus Christ.

1525
01:35:34,385 --> 01:35:36,393
Excuse me.

1526
01:35:36,433 --> 01:35:39,630
Charlie, I just came
to say good-bye.

1527
01:35:39,666 --> 01:35:40,713
Fine, Henry.

1528
01:35:40,754 --> 01:35:41,998
We'll see you tomorrow.

1529
01:35:42,034 --> 01:35:45,034
Uh... no, Charlie.

1530
01:35:45,074 --> 01:35:48,239
I can't be a lawyer anymore.

1531
01:35:48,275 --> 01:35:49,355
Thank you.

1532
01:35:49,395 --> 01:35:51,087
You've been really good to me.

1533
01:35:58,037 --> 01:35:59,117
Just wait.

1534
01:35:59,157 --> 01:36:01,361
We'll talk about this.

1535
01:36:01,397 --> 01:36:02,477
I can't wait.

1536
01:36:02,517 --> 01:36:03,761
Good-bye.

1537
01:36:03,797 --> 01:36:06,002
Well, good luck.

1538
01:36:06,037 --> 01:36:07,281
Mr. Cameron.

1539
01:36:07,318 --> 01:36:09,685
I have the Matthews' lawyer
on line three.

1540
01:36:09,718 --> 01:36:12,588
Good luck to you too,
Charlie.

1541
01:36:17,559 --> 01:36:19,795
Good-bye, Jessica.

1542
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,513
Mr. Turner, what happened?

1543
01:36:22,552 --> 01:36:24,243
Well...

1544
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:27,924
I had enough, so I said "when. "

1545
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:31,957
Good for you.

1546
01:36:33,241 --> 01:36:34,518
Bye.

1547
01:36:42,170 --> 01:36:44,407
Good-bye, Linda.

1548
01:36:56,765 --> 01:37:00,278
I know this great
blowfish place.

1549
01:37:06,781 --> 01:37:08,189
Henry...

1550
01:37:08,222 --> 01:37:10,906
I'm sorry.

1551
01:37:10,974 --> 01:37:13,309
No, I'm sorry.

1552
01:37:13,343 --> 01:37:15,383
You were right.

1553
01:37:15,423 --> 01:37:17,365
Things were different.

1554
01:37:17,407 --> 01:37:21,019
Oh, Henry.

1555
01:37:29,568 --> 01:37:33,311
There's something
I need to tell you.

1556
01:37:33,346 --> 01:37:35,735
What is it?

1557
01:37:37,346 --> 01:37:40,194
I don't like my clothes.

1558
01:37:40,227 --> 01:37:42,366
Maybe they used
to be my favorites,

1559
01:37:42,403 --> 01:37:45,218
but I don't feel
comfortable in them anymore.

1560
01:37:46,211 --> 01:37:48,699
We'll get you new clothes.

1561
01:37:49,668 --> 01:37:51,643
I'm not done.

1562
01:37:51,684 --> 01:37:53,757
Eggs.

1563
01:37:55,044 --> 01:37:56,768
I don't like eggs.

1564
01:37:56,805 --> 01:37:59,358
Or steak.

1565
01:38:00,485 --> 01:38:03,169
And, Sarah...

1566
01:38:03,206 --> 01:38:05,410
I hate being a lawyer.

1567
01:38:05,446 --> 01:38:08,097
I quit
and I told Charlie good-bye.

1568
01:38:09,446 --> 01:38:12,446
Whatever you want is fine.

1569
01:38:12,487 --> 01:38:15,651
I want us to be a family.

1570
01:38:15,687 --> 01:38:18,688
For as long as we can, Sarah.

1571
01:38:18,728 --> 01:38:21,762
For as long as we can.

1572
01:38:23,848 --> 01:38:25,888
I love you.

1573
01:38:25,928 --> 01:38:27,685
Oh, I love you, too.

1574
01:38:32,489 --> 01:38:36,101
I did like those mallomars,
though.

1575
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:45,320
And you're all learning
what that means

1576
01:38:45,356 --> 01:38:48,258
when you ask yourself,
"Why do I push myself?

1577
01:38:48,299 --> 01:38:51,595
"Why do I strive to be
a harder worker?

1578
01:38:51,628 --> 01:38:53,417
A better listener?"

1579
01:38:53,453 --> 01:38:55,144
Well, look around you.

1580
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:58,312
There are the answers
to those questions.

1581
01:38:58,349 --> 01:39:00,586
Competition.

1582
01:39:00,622 --> 01:39:03,305
Everyone, close your eyes.

1583
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:07,692
Repeat to yourself silently:

1584
01:39:07,726 --> 01:39:13,062
"I will work harder. "

1585
01:39:14,031 --> 01:39:15,919
"I will listen better. "

1586
01:39:15,951 --> 01:39:17,162
Buddy?

1587
01:39:25,713 --> 01:39:27,720
You taught Buddy to sit.

1588
01:39:29,074 --> 01:39:31,245
Mr. Turner.

1589
01:39:31,282 --> 01:39:33,354
We're in the middle
of a session.

1590
01:39:33,394 --> 01:39:34,638
I know.

1591
01:39:34,674 --> 01:39:37,674
I'm... I'm sorry to interrupt.

1592
01:39:37,715 --> 01:39:39,624
I...

1593
01:39:40,595 --> 01:39:44,076
I missed her first 11 years,
and...

1594
01:39:44,115 --> 01:39:47,345
and-and I don't want to miss
anymore.

1595
01:39:47,379 --> 01:39:51,155
It's good to see you doing
so well, Mr. Turner.

1596
01:39:51,188 --> 01:39:52,170
Thank you.

1597
01:39:52,213 --> 01:39:53,969
Excuse us.

1598
01:39:57,493 --> 01:39:58,737
Come on, honey.

1599
01:39:58,773 --> 01:40:00,050
Let's go home.

1600
01:40:04,726 --> 01:40:06,450
Hi, honey.
