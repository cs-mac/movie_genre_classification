1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:05,924
<i> We lay, my love and I </i>

2
00:00:06,022 --> 00:00:10,659
<i>Beneath the weeping willow </i>

3
00:00:10,758 --> 00:00:14,785
<i>But now alone I lie </i>

4
00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:19,197
<i>And weep beside the tree </i>

5
00:00:19,303 --> 00:00:23,646
<i>Singing "O Willow Waly"</i>

6
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:28,062
<i>By the tree
that weeps with me </i>

7
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:32,062
<i>Singing "O Willow Waly"</i>

8
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:37,122
<i> Till my lover returns to me </i>

9
00:00:37,224 --> 00:00:41,480
<i> We lay, my love and I </i>

10
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:46,149
<i>Beneath the weeping willow </i>

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,528
<i>But now alone I lie </i>

12
00:00:51,754 --> 00:00:56,065
<i> O willow, I die </i>

13
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,953
<i> O willow, I die </i>

14
00:02:43,317 --> 00:02:46,579
<i>All I want to do is save the children... </i>

15
00:02:46,677 --> 00:02:48,564
<i>not destroy them. </i>

16
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,132
<i>More than anything,
I love children. </i>

17
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:00,502
<i>More than anything. </i>

18
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:07,829
<i>They need affection... </i>

19
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:09,750
<i>love... </i>

20
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:12,531
<i>someone who will
belong to them... </i>

21
00:03:12,632 --> 00:03:15,120
<i>and to whom they will belong. </i>

22
00:03:15,224 --> 00:03:18,934
<i> Miss Giddens,
may I ask you a somewhat personal question?</i>

23
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,105
<i>Do you have an imagination?</i>

24
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:23,031
Oh!

25
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:25,551
Oh, yes,
I can answer that.

26
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:27,926
<i>- Yes.
- Good. </i>

27
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:31,092
Truth is very seldom understood
by any but imaginative persons...

28
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:33,266
and I want to be quite truthful.

29
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,152
I'm a bachelor...

30
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,552
but not, I might add,
a lonely one.

31
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,952
I spend a great deal
of time abroad.

32
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,084
And as for my London life,
well, it amuses me...

33
00:03:44,187 --> 00:03:49,370
but it's not the sort of amusement
that one could suitably share with children.

34
00:03:49,468 --> 00:03:51,224
In brief, Miss Giddens...

35
00:03:51,323 --> 00:03:53,713
I am a very selfish fellow...

36
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,650
and the last man alive to be saddled
so suddenly and so awkwardly...

37
00:03:57,756 --> 00:03:59,993
with two orphaned infants.

38
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:02,875
It's most unfortunate...

39
00:04:02,973 --> 00:04:06,203
for I have no room for them,
neither mentally nor emotionally.

40
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:08,309
<i>Does that seem quite heartless?</i>

41
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:11,348
Honest, but not heartless.

42
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:15,387
Then the children
do not live with you?

43
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:17,723
No. They are at
my country estate in Bly.

44
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:20,124
A rather large,
rather lonely place.

45
00:04:20,222 --> 00:04:23,736
Still, I'm sure you'll agree,
the country seems the proper thing for children.

46
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,156
I see from your letter that you are,
yourself, the daughter of a country parson...

47
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,849
and, um-
oh, yes, here it is-

48
00:04:29,952 --> 00:04:31,839
"More than anything,
I love children. "

49
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,441
<i>- Yes.
- How remarkable. </i>

50
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:38,366
For several years now...

51
00:04:38,464 --> 00:04:40,286
little Miles and Flora-

52
00:04:40,384 --> 00:04:42,424
Charming names,
don't you think-

53
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:44,351
have had only me.

54
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:47,483
Well, poor brats,
they need more than a distant uncle.

55
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:49,112
Well, of course they need
more than a governess.

56
00:04:49,217 --> 00:04:51,039
They need affection and love...

57
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:54,934
and someone to whom they can belong
and who will belong to them.

58
00:04:56,098 --> 00:04:57,920
You, Miss Giddens.

59
00:04:58,018 --> 00:05:01,596
<i>I feel that you are that person. </i>

60
00:05:01,698 --> 00:05:04,000
Sir, you-

61
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:07,198
you do realize that this
would be my first position.

62
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:09,122
<i>What does that signify... </i>

63
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,962
<i>if I trust you,
if you trust me?</i>

64
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,842
<i>You see, Miss Giddens,
the person whom I engage... </i>

65
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,770
must solemnly promise
to accept full and complete responsibility.

66
00:05:20,868 --> 00:05:22,691
<i>She must never trouble me. </i>

67
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:24,611
<i>Never. Never. </i>

68
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:26,531
<i>Neither complain
nor appeal nor write. </i>

69
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:30,110
Simply take
the whole thing over and...

70
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:32,101
leave me alone.

71
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:35,045
What do you say, Miss Giddens?

72
00:05:38,022 --> 00:05:40,030
<i>The children, uh-</i>

73
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:44,768
<i>- Have they had a governess before?
- Unfortunately. </i>

74
00:05:44,871 --> 00:05:47,588
Not that there was anything wrong
with Miss Jessel.

75
00:05:47,687 --> 00:05:50,469
She was an excellent governess
and a most respectable woman.

76
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:53,349
The children quite liked her,
especially little Flora.

77
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:57,310
Oh, which reminds me, be careful
not to broach that subject to Flora.

78
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,678
She was so fond
of Miss Jessel, and...

79
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:03,558
it did come
as an appalling shock.

80
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:06,439
I'm not certain that I understand you, sir.

81
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:08,359
She died.

82
00:06:08,457 --> 00:06:11,239
Yes, just when I thought
I'd got the whole situation settled...

83
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,476
and everything
running smoothly...

84
00:06:13,577 --> 00:06:16,545
the confounded woman died.

85
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,105
It was all very odd.

86
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,511
I was in Calcutta
when it happened...

87
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,393
and have only now been able
to seek a replacement.

88
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:27,273
Meantime, my nephew had
to be sent off to school...

89
00:06:27,371 --> 00:06:30,633
and the little girl, Flora, is being
chaperoned by my housekeeper...

90
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:33,033
<i>Mrs. Grose. </i>

91
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:37,322
<i>Help me, Miss Giddens,
for truly I am helpless. </i>

92
00:06:39,884 --> 00:06:41,989
Give me your hand.

93
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:43,980
Give me your promise.

94
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:47,691
Well, sir...

95
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:49,764
if you are really sure-

96
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:52,652
Quite sure,
and very grateful.

97
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,684
Only remember,
you're in supreme authority.

98
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,784
Whatever happens,
you must handle it alone.

99
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:02,341
Yes, I'll try.

100
00:07:02,446 --> 00:07:04,868
I promise you that.

101
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:08,237
I'll do everything I can
to keep the children happy.

102
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,152
<i>Oh, stop. Please stop!</i>

103
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:02,449
<i>- Whoa there. 
- If you don't mind, I think
I'd like to walk from here.</i>

104
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,588
<i>As you wish, miss. Whoa. </i>

105
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:13,492
Thank you.

106
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:03,184
<i>Flora!</i>

107
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:08,210
<i>Flora!</i>

108
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,098
<i>Flora!</i>

109
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:29,942
<i>Didn't you hear?
Someone is calling your name. </i>

110
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:32,827
No, I don't think so.
I didn't hear anyone.

111
00:09:32,925 --> 00:09:34,813
Isn't your name Flora?

112
00:09:35,965 --> 00:09:37,788
I'm Miss Giddens.

113
00:09:37,886 --> 00:09:39,958
Yes, I know.
You're my new governess.

114
00:09:40,062 --> 00:09:42,844
I've been watching the road,
waiting for you.

115
00:09:42,942 --> 00:09:46,041
- Are you afraid of reptiles?
- That rather depends. Why?

116
00:09:46,142 --> 00:09:49,404
Because I've got one in my pocket,
and he's very eager to meet you.

117
00:09:49,503 --> 00:09:51,870
Well, in that case,
by all means.

118
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:54,941
His name is Rupert.

119
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:57,341
- Oh, a tortoise.
- We love each other.

120
00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:01,302
- Yes, I can see that you're very close.
- Very.

121
00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:03,447
There, now you've
met Miss Giddens.

122
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:05,462
But Rupert isn't the only one.

123
00:10:05,568 --> 00:10:07,478
I mean, ever since
my uncle wrote...

124
00:10:07,584 --> 00:10:09,886
we've all been waiting
and waiting for you to come.

125
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,806
Oh, we have been excited.

126
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:13,726
So have I.
I've been very excited indeed.

127
00:10:13,824 --> 00:10:16,607
Not as excited as we have.
And not as excited as Mrs. Grose.

128
00:10:16,705 --> 00:10:19,487
She's cleaned and cleaned
and had all the windows washed.

129
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,407
Just imagine-
134 windows!

130
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:24,353
- All that for me?
- Yes. And I helped!

131
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:29,787
- Oh, we will have fun together, won't we?
- Yes, we will, dear.

132
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:34,304
Oh, Mrs. Grose, she's here!
And she isn't afraid of reptiles.

133
00:10:34,403 --> 00:10:37,785
And that's more than can be said of me,
isn't it?

134
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:40,193
I walked from the gate.

135
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:43,074
I- I wanted to see it all.

136
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:45,954
I'm glad to see you, Miss Giddens.

137
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:48,027
Really, I'm glad.

138
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:49,955
Oh, do please come in.

139
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:51,940
Thank you.
You're very kind.

140
00:10:57,893 --> 00:11:01,155
- Oh!
- Now, I expect you'd like a cup of tea.

141
00:11:01,254 --> 00:11:03,392
- Thank you.
- But not you, Miss Flora.

142
00:11:03,494 --> 00:11:07,007
Now, you know you're not allowed
in the house with that toad or turtle...

143
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,215
<i>or whatever it is. </i>

144
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:12,100
- Go on. Run along. Off you go.
- Oh, all right.

145
00:11:12,198 --> 00:11:14,654
I had no idea.

146
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,931
I never imagined-

147
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:18,854
Oh, I'm so sorry.

148
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:21,952
That's all right, miss.
It's always happening.

149
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,266
I never imagined
it would be so beautiful.

150
00:11:27,368 --> 00:11:29,190
Well, we do our best.

151
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:32,965
Though half the rooms are empty now-
locked and empty.

152
00:11:33,064 --> 00:11:36,480
<i>All the same, it's too big,
a job to keep clean. </i>

153
00:11:36,585 --> 00:11:39,847
<i>But what I always say is,
it's a heaven for children. </i>

154
00:11:39,945 --> 00:11:41,767
Oh, yes, a heaven!

155
00:11:41,865 --> 00:11:44,167
And what an enchanting child
she is.

156
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:46,088
There's not another like her.

157
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:48,969
Though, mind you, she has her ways.
You have your work cut out.

158
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:50,889
I don't doubt.

159
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:53,769
<i>But she seems-
Well, she certainly looks angelic.</i>

160
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:55,689
Well, she is too.

161
00:11:55,787 --> 00:11:58,569
But she does like to wander,
to go off by herself.

162
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:01,450
- We're always hunting her.
- Oh, yes. I heard you.

163
00:12:01,548 --> 00:12:05,290
Just now, as I was coming through the garden,
I heard you call her name.

164
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:07,210
Oh, not me, miss.

165
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:09,316
Perhaps it was Anna or Cook.

166
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,243
Well, someone.

167
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,642
<i>Sit down, miss,
and have your tea. </i>

168
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,042
Mmm, it'll be dark in here soon.

169
00:12:16,141 --> 00:12:18,508
I'll get Anna
to bring some lamps.

170
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:23,212
Miss Giddens?

171
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,474
Miss Giddens! Has she gone?

172
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:28,461
<i>Yes, for the moment. </i>

173
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,709
You don't mind Rupert sharing a bit
of your cake, now, do you?

174
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:40,393
Watch out.
He'll grow too fat to fit your pocket.

175
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:42,470
- I have a pony too.
- Oh.

176
00:12:42,576 --> 00:12:45,510
He isn't really mine.
He belongs to Miles.

177
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:48,551
Miles is my brother, you know.
He's away at school.

178
00:12:48,655 --> 00:12:50,478
You must miss him very much.

179
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:53,129
Well, he'll be coming home soon.

180
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:56,494
Not, I should think,
until the holidays.

181
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:59,942
Time you went upstairs and got ready
for your bath, Miss Flora.

182
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:02,570
Promise, now, you won't go away.

183
00:13:02,673 --> 00:13:05,673
I expect to be here
for a very long time.

184
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:14,834
And to think what qualms I had.

185
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,818
I was so afraid.

186
00:13:18,322 --> 00:13:20,712
<i>- Afraid, miss?
- I couldn't make up my mind. </i>

187
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:23,186
Should I accept this post,
or shouldn't I?

188
00:13:23,283 --> 00:13:26,066
Well, miss, I'm sure
I'm very glad you did.

189
00:13:26,163 --> 00:13:28,171
<i>After all,
I didn't have much choice. </i>

190
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,479
Their uncle is most persuasive.

191
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,882
<i>And don't I know it. </i>

192
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,249
Many's the time
he's worked his magic on me.

193
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:38,130
Even when he was a boy
he could twist you around his finger...

194
00:13:38,228 --> 00:13:40,432
and the children
are the same way.

195
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:44,019
He doesn't come down here
very often?

196
00:13:44,117 --> 00:13:46,256
Well, he likes the town life.

197
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:48,332
He always was
a very popular gentleman.

198
00:13:48,437 --> 00:13:51,220
And what's the good
of being popular down here...

199
00:13:51,318 --> 00:13:54,165
<i>with only the children
and the pigeons and me?</i>

200
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,972
- Mrs. Grose?
- Yes, miss?

201
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,438
- What was she like?
- Who, miss?

202
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:02,608
The other governess.
The one who died.

203
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:05,973
Who, Miss Jessel?
Oh, she was a young woman.

204
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:08,853
Some thought her pretty,
and, well, I suppose she was.

205
00:14:08,951 --> 00:14:10,959
But not as pretty as you, miss.

206
00:14:11,064 --> 00:14:12,952
Not by half.

207
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,299
He seems to prefer them
young and pretty.

208
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,954
He did. He had
the devil's own eye-

209
00:14:20,057 --> 00:14:22,840
I mean, that's his way,
the master's.

210
00:14:22,937 --> 00:14:26,483
- But of whom did you speak first?
- Why, the master, of course.

211
00:14:26,585 --> 00:14:29,007
There's nobody else, miss.
Nobody at all.

212
00:14:35,194 --> 00:14:37,977
Be careful, dear, or you'll splash
Miss Giddens!

213
00:14:38,074 --> 00:14:41,817
And is the other one just as remarkable?
Is he too as enchanting?

214
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,737
Well, if you like this one...

215
00:14:43,835 --> 00:14:45,657
you should be quite carried away
by Master Miles.

216
00:14:45,755 --> 00:14:47,578
Miles is coming!

217
00:14:47,675 --> 00:14:50,458
I seem to be carried away quite easily.
That's what happened to me in London.

218
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,378
Miles is coming!
Miles is coming!

219
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:55,258
Stuff and nonsense.
You know very well Miles is at school.

220
00:14:55,356 --> 00:14:57,625
Now, hold still.

221
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,093
I've got a little bed in your room.
It's got curtains.

222
00:15:03,197 --> 00:15:05,369
- How nice.
- Yes.

223
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:07,477
Mrs. Grose wanted
to give you a big room...

224
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:10,364
but I said,
"She'll only be there when she's asleep. "

225
00:15:10,462 --> 00:15:14,204
- Big rooms get bigger at night. Do you know that?
- Do they?

226
00:15:14,302 --> 00:15:16,124
Mrs. Grose doesn't know.

227
00:15:16,222 --> 00:15:18,327
She shuts her eyes in the dark.

228
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,732
I think that's silly.

229
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,548
- I always look in the dark.
- Do you?

230
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,469
And what do you see?

231
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:27,389
There are
a lot of empty rooms.

232
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:31,678
I said, to Mrs. Grose, "I wish there was
some way of sleeping in several rooms at once. "

233
00:15:31,775 --> 00:15:34,558
Mrs. Grose was quite
startled by the thought.

234
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:38,966
- I don't wonder!
- "Stuff and nonsense," she said.
"Stuff and nonsense. "

235
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:50,271
Now I lay me down to sleep.

236
00:15:50,369 --> 00:15:52,192
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep-

237
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:54,591
Why can't Rupert sleep with me?

238
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,992
Because you might roll over
and crush him.

239
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,912
Crush a tortoise?

240
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,832
Now finish your prayers, dear.

241
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,753
If I should wake before I-

242
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,633
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

243
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,553
Amen.

244
00:16:07,651 --> 00:16:10,433
Miss Giddens, where would the Lord
take my soul to?

245
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:12,354
- To heaven.
- Are you certain?

246
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:15,234
Yes, of course,
because you're a very, very good girl.

247
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:17,154
But I might not be.

248
00:16:17,252 --> 00:16:20,700
And if I weren't, wouldn't the Lord just
leave me here to walk around?

249
00:16:20,804 --> 00:16:24,066
Isn't that what happens
to some people?

250
00:16:26,757 --> 00:16:28,644
Whatever was that?

251
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:35,135
I'm sure something's been hurt.

252
00:16:35,238 --> 00:16:37,060
An animal.

253
00:16:37,158 --> 00:16:39,678
We must pretend we didn't hear it.
That's what Mrs. Grose says.

254
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:44,675
- Pretend?
- Then we won't imagine things.

255
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:50,596
Sometimes one can't help...
imagining things.

256
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,525
<i>By the tree that weeps with me </i>

257
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:29,327
<i>Singing "O Willow Waly"</i>

258
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:32,208
<i>-  Till my lover-
- You should be outdoors on a day like this. </i>

259
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:34,128
<i>I was just practicing, Mrs. Grose. </i>

260
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:37,008
- Have you seen Miss Giddens, my lamb?
- I'm out here, Mrs. Grose.

261
00:18:37,106 --> 00:18:38,994
Oh!

262
00:18:40,562 --> 00:18:42,384
There's some letters
for you, miss.

263
00:18:42,482 --> 00:18:45,264
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, please, can I help you read them?

264
00:18:45,362 --> 00:18:47,185
- Yes, if you like.
- Which first?

265
00:18:47,282 --> 00:18:49,105
Now, how can I tell?

266
00:18:49,203 --> 00:18:51,090
- Then I shall choose.
- All right.

267
00:18:54,388 --> 00:18:56,210
Here.

268
00:18:56,308 --> 00:18:58,196
This one's from my sister.

269
00:19:01,428 --> 00:19:03,250
Oh, look, dear.

270
00:19:03,348 --> 00:19:06,130
Here's a picture of me
and my family together.

271
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,011
<i>- Am I in it?
- How could you be? It's of my family.</i>

272
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:10,931
Oh.

273
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:12,851
- Now this one.
- It's from London.

274
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:16,397
- Is it from my uncle?
- Yes, I think it is.

275
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:18,411
You do look pleased.

276
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,735
Is he coming to see us?

277
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:26,003
No, dear. He's sent me a letter
from Miles's school.

278
00:19:42,488 --> 00:19:45,238
- Flora?
- Yes, Miss Giddens, dear?

279
00:19:45,336 --> 00:19:48,118
<i>Didn't you say last night
that Miles was coming home?</i>

280
00:19:48,216 --> 00:19:50,039
Oh, look.

281
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:51,959
It's a lovely spider...

282
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,944
and it's eating a butterfly.

283
00:20:01,818 --> 00:20:04,207
Mrs. Grose?

284
00:20:04,314 --> 00:20:07,097
Here's a letter their uncle
has forwarded without opening.

285
00:20:07,195 --> 00:20:09,017
It's from Miles's school.

286
00:20:09,115 --> 00:20:11,832
He just wrote on the envelope,
"Am off to Italy for the summer.

287
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:15,193
This is from Miles's headmaster.
Deal with it without bothering me. "

288
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:18,358
- That's just his way, miss.
- But how am I to deal with it?

289
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,532
Miles has been dismissed
from school.

290
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,157
<i>- Dismissed?
- Sent home. </i>

291
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,846
Expelled.

292
00:20:25,949 --> 00:20:28,731
But what has he done?
What do the gentlemen say?

293
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:31,764
They go into no detail.
They simply say-

294
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:33,692
Here. Read it.

295
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,677
Read it for yourself.

296
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:40,476
It's no good, miss.
I never learned.

297
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,094
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize.

298
00:20:44,574 --> 00:20:47,356
They say that it is impossible
to keep him.

299
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,277
Why?

300
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,197
That he is...

301
00:20:51,295 --> 00:20:53,117
an injury to the others.

302
00:20:53,215 --> 00:20:55,997
Master Miles?
Him, an injury?

303
00:20:56,095 --> 00:20:57,918
Oh, stuff and nonsense.

304
00:20:58,015 --> 00:21:00,798
You might as well think ill
of Miss Flora, bless her.

305
00:21:00,896 --> 00:21:04,158
- You've never known him to be bad?
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.

306
00:21:04,256 --> 00:21:06,558
You mean
you like a boy with spirit.

307
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:09,023
Well, so do I,
but not to the degree to...

308
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,943
contaminate.

309
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,928
<i>To what?</i>

310
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:16,191
To corrupt.

311
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:18,111
Master Miles?

312
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:21,690
Oh, miss, are you afraid he'll corrupt you?

313
00:21:29,603 --> 00:21:33,148
<i>Miles is coming! Miles is coming!
Miles is coming!</i>

314
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:36,153
<i>Bly! Bly station!</i>

315
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,650
Miles! Miles!

316
00:21:41,315 --> 00:21:44,033
<i>Miles. </i>

317
00:21:44,131 --> 00:21:46,783
<i>- You're Miss Giddens, aren't you?
- Yes.</i>

318
00:21:46,884 --> 00:21:48,445
How do you do?

319
00:21:50,116 --> 00:21:51,939
Oh, thank you, Miles.

320
00:21:52,037 --> 00:21:55,266
<i> She's our new governess, Miles,
and she's awfully nice. </i>

321
00:21:55,365 --> 00:21:57,252
I hope Miles will agree.

322
00:21:58,566 --> 00:22:01,086
Come on.

323
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,189
Nothing's changed.

324
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:12,069
Oh, I've been longing
for these holidays.

325
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:14,469
Holidays?

326
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:17,698
Longing to see Bly
and Mrs. Grose and Flora.

327
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:21,411
And you. Flora wrote
and told me you were coming.

328
00:22:23,816 --> 00:22:26,598
Did you have
a good term at school?

329
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:28,933
Look, Miles!
There's the lake!

330
00:22:29,032 --> 00:22:31,367
<i>Oh, it is nice to be back. </i>

331
00:22:31,465 --> 00:22:33,407
<i>I hope you won't be lonely... </i>

332
00:22:33,513 --> 00:22:36,360
with just Flora
and Mrs. Grose and me.

333
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,338
Were you happy at school?

334
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:47,241
May I tell you something?

335
00:22:47,338 --> 00:22:49,411
Yes, Miles, of course.

336
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:53,476
I think you're far too pretty
to be a governess.

337
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:57,124
And I think you're far too young to be
such a deceitful flatterer.

338
00:23:09,356 --> 00:23:11,658
Dearest Mrs. Grose!

339
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:15,979
- It is nice to be home.
- Stop! Stop! You'll have me out of breath!

340
00:23:16,077 --> 00:23:18,379
It's all just the same.

341
00:23:18,477 --> 00:23:22,219
Somehow- I don't know-
I was afraid it might be different.

342
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,619
Oh, nothing ever changes here,
Master Miles.

343
00:23:24,718 --> 00:23:27,500
You look a bit thin, though.
We'll have to fatten you up.

344
00:23:27,598 --> 00:23:29,737
Oh, Miles,
you haven't seen the pony!

345
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:31,661
- May we?
- Yes, of course!

346
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,646
Come on!

347
00:23:37,711 --> 00:23:39,534
Well, miss?

348
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:43,047
It's just as you said.
Charm seems to run in the family.

349
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:45,224
And that cruel letter?

350
00:23:45,328 --> 00:23:47,303
It must be a misunderstanding,
a mistake.

351
00:23:47,408 --> 00:23:49,230
Yes, a mistake.

352
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:51,630
So, uh, what will you say
to Master Miles?

353
00:23:51,728 --> 00:23:53,550
I shall have it out with him
later on.

354
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:55,471
That can't be avoided.
But not now.

355
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:58,830
I'm not going to spoil his homecoming
because of some silly schoolteacher.

356
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:00,685
Oh, yes, miss.

357
00:24:00,785 --> 00:24:04,102
Oh, I- I'm so thankful
we're not to have trouble.

358
00:24:06,994 --> 00:24:10,310
Dear Mrs. Grose,
what a comfort you are.

359
00:24:26,739 --> 00:24:29,903
<i>Why don't you come in, Miss Giddens. </i>

360
00:24:31,989 --> 00:24:33,963
How did you know
I was there?

361
00:24:34,068 --> 00:24:37,102
This is a very old house.
Things creak.

362
00:24:37,204 --> 00:24:40,750
<i>And anyway, I saw the light
from your candle under the door. </i>

363
00:24:41,877 --> 00:24:43,700
You should be asleep.

364
00:24:43,797 --> 00:24:45,620
<i>- I'm much too excited. 
- Excited?</i>

365
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,922
By being home. By seeing Flora.

366
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,998
And meeting you.

367
00:24:52,342 --> 00:24:54,165
Besides, I like to lie awake.

368
00:24:54,263 --> 00:24:56,085
That's a very bad habit, Miles.

369
00:24:56,183 --> 00:24:58,419
- Is it?
- Yes.

370
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:01,781
What do you think about
while you're lying awake?

371
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:04,181
Oh, a world
of different things.

372
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,102
And tonight...

373
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,502
were you, perhaps,
thinking about school?

374
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,447
Oh, no. All that
seems very far away.

375
00:25:12,665 --> 00:25:14,487
Miles...

376
00:25:14,585 --> 00:25:18,197
you do know that you will not be
allowed to go back.

377
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:22,424
You realize that it is
a very serious matter...

378
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:25,369
for a boy to be expelled
from school.

379
00:25:27,322 --> 00:25:30,104
I can't think
what your uncle will say.

380
00:25:30,202 --> 00:25:32,025
Can't you?
I can.

381
00:25:32,123 --> 00:25:34,741
He'll say, "Don't bother me.
I'm too busy. "

382
00:25:34,843 --> 00:25:37,145
- Miles, that's not true.
- Isn't it?

383
00:25:37,242 --> 00:25:40,025
You've met him, haven't you?
You know what he's like.

384
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:42,425
He doesn't care
about me or Flora.

385
00:25:42,523 --> 00:25:45,306
He doesn't care
what happens to us.

386
00:25:45,404 --> 00:25:48,186
Miles, dear,
you mustn't believe that.

387
00:25:48,284 --> 00:25:50,521
Your uncle has-

388
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,094
Well, he has... a great many responsibilities
and not enough time-

389
00:25:55,196 --> 00:25:57,204
To waste any on us?

390
00:25:57,308 --> 00:25:59,698
I understand.

391
00:25:59,805 --> 00:26:01,627
It's a bit sad though...

392
00:26:01,725 --> 00:26:04,508
when people
don't have time for you.

393
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:06,493
Oh, I have, Miles.

394
00:26:09,886 --> 00:26:12,122
I have time.

395
00:26:12,222 --> 00:26:14,044
And I care.

396
00:26:14,142 --> 00:26:18,201
And, Miles, if there's something
wrong about school...

397
00:26:18,303 --> 00:26:21,151
<i>if there's something
you want to tell me-</i>

398
00:26:22,303 --> 00:26:25,370
<i>Miles, dear Miles... </i>

399
00:26:25,471 --> 00:26:28,668
can't you see that
I want to help you?

400
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,396
Trust me.

401
00:26:40,993 --> 00:26:43,165
The candle's gone out.

402
00:26:43,265 --> 00:26:48,568
<i>Don't be frightened. It was only the wind,
my dear. The wind blew it out. </i>

403
00:26:50,114 --> 00:26:54,270
<i> We lay, my love and I </i>

404
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:58,397
<i>Beneath a weeping willow </i>

405
00:26:58,498 --> 00:27:02,809
<i>But now alone I lie </i>

406
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:07,072
<i>And weep beside the tree </i>

407
00:27:07,172 --> 00:27:10,139
<i>Singing "O Willow Waly"</i>

408
00:27:10,244 --> 00:27:11,771
<i>By the tree </i>

409
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:14,331
<i> That weeps with me </i>

410
00:27:15,748 --> 00:27:19,491
<i>Singing "O Willow Waly"</i>

411
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:21,444
<i> Till my lover returns-</i>

412
00:27:57,449 --> 00:28:00,995
<i> We lay, my love and I </i>

413
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:05,472
<i>Beneath a weeping willow </i>

414
00:28:05,577 --> 00:28:09,506
<i>But now alone I lie </i>

415
00:28:10,826 --> 00:28:14,917
<i> O willow, I die </i>

416
00:28:15,018 --> 00:28:18,434
<i> O willow, I die </i>

417
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,768
Miles.

418
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:30,063
How long have you been here?

419
00:29:30,161 --> 00:29:32,944
I don't know-
20 minutes, half an hour.

420
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:36,009
- Oh, then you must have seen him.
- Who?

421
00:29:36,114 --> 00:29:39,278
The man who was
standing here on the tower.

422
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:43,120
I've been quite alone,
except for my greedy friends.

423
00:29:43,218 --> 00:29:44,974
Well, that can't be true.

424
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,857
Not two minutes ago
I saw a man standing exactly here.

425
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:49,778
Perhaps it was me.

426
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,763
No, no, it was a man.

427
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:54,761
He was looking at me.

428
00:29:54,868 --> 00:29:56,723
I expect you imagined it.

429
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,642
Or else- Oh, dear.

430
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,042
I hope you won't have to
wear spectacles.

431
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,963
You're much too pretty for that.

432
00:30:03,061 --> 00:30:04,883
Oh, yes, I expect I'm tired.

433
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:06,803
I haven't been sleeping well.

434
00:30:06,901 --> 00:30:08,723
I know.

435
00:30:08,821 --> 00:30:10,644
Flora told me.

436
00:30:10,741 --> 00:30:13,524
She says you make
little groans and moans all night.

437
00:30:13,622 --> 00:30:16,404
Of course, one can
never believe Flora.

438
00:30:16,502 --> 00:30:19,764
She invents things,
imagines them.

439
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:22,961
You mean, like poor,
silly Miss Giddens?

440
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:40,598
Miss, would these,
by any chance, be yours?

441
00:30:40,696 --> 00:30:44,373
Scissors. The gardener brought them up.
He said he found them in the garden.

442
00:30:44,472 --> 00:30:48,215
I must have dropped them this morning
when I-whilst I was cutting roses.

443
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,135
And just left them there.

444
00:30:50,233 --> 00:30:52,535
I'm afraid today
isn't altogether my day.

445
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:54,935
I seem to be
at sixes and sevens.

446
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:57,816
<i>Well, miss, you’ve never been away
from home before. </i>

447
00:30:57,914 --> 00:30:59,736
A strange place,
new responsibilities.

448
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:02,616
- Takes a bit of getting used to-
- Mrs. Grose.

449
00:31:02,714 --> 00:31:05,496
Is there anyone living here
that I don't know about?

450
00:31:05,594 --> 00:31:08,856
- Living here?
- In the house, I mean.

451
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:12,698
I've met the two maids, the cook
and her husband, the gardener...

452
00:31:12,795 --> 00:31:16,058
and I was just wondering
if there was someone I hadn't met.

453
00:31:16,155 --> 00:31:19,417
Bless you, miss, I wish there were.
We could use another pair of hands.

454
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:20,763
<i>Oh, hurry! Do come!</i>

455
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:22,011
<i>Oh, hurry! Do come!</i>

456
00:31:22,108 --> 00:31:24,890
You must see!
Miles is giving an "expedition!"

457
00:31:24,988 --> 00:31:27,836
Oh, come! You must see!
He's awfully brave!

458
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:46,750
Miles!

459
00:31:54,015 --> 00:31:56,765
<i>Flora, watch me!</i>

460
00:31:56,864 --> 00:31:59,450
Miles!

461
00:32:06,721 --> 00:32:08,576
Miles?

462
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:12,631
I didn't know you were watching.

463
00:32:12,738 --> 00:32:14,942
That was very clever, Miles.

464
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:34,401
Do look, Miss Giddens.
I can draw too.

465
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:37,347
Miles isn't the only one
who can draw.

466
00:32:38,532 --> 00:32:40,354
Oh, yes.
Now I see.

467
00:32:40,452 --> 00:32:42,786
It's lovely.
A vase of flowers.

468
00:32:42,884 --> 00:32:45,667
Goodness, no.
It's a thunderstorm.

469
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:48,547
- See the clouds and the lightning?
- Oh, yes, dear.

470
00:32:48,645 --> 00:32:50,947
Yes, well, I'm sure
it's very original.

471
00:32:51,044 --> 00:32:53,892
- Perhaps you'll grow up to be a famous artist.
- Did you hear that, Miles?

472
00:32:53,989 --> 00:32:57,306
Yes, dear. But Miss Giddens
is merely being polite.

473
00:32:57,413 --> 00:33:01,691
<i>Tell me, Miss Giddens, what do you think
I might grow up to be?</i>

474
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:03,522
Anything you want.

475
00:33:03,622 --> 00:33:05,924
There's nothing
I want to be...

476
00:33:06,022 --> 00:33:09,503
except what I am-
a boy living at Bly.

477
00:33:09,607 --> 00:33:13,404
Oh, if only everything
could go on just as it is now.

478
00:33:14,855 --> 00:33:16,677
I love this house.

479
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:18,597
<i>Don't you, Miss Giddens?</i>

480
00:33:18,695 --> 00:33:20,518
It's very beautiful.

481
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:22,438
And so large.

482
00:33:22,536 --> 00:33:25,951
I expect it's the biggest house
in England.

483
00:33:26,057 --> 00:33:27,879
The whole world, actually.

484
00:33:27,977 --> 00:33:29,864
Oh, hardly
the whole world, Flora.

485
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,336
<i>Your house, where you used to live-
was that a big house too?</i>

486
00:33:34,441 --> 00:33:36,198
No, it was very small,
I'm afraid.

487
00:33:36,297 --> 00:33:39,462
<i>- How small?
- Very, very small.</i>

488
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:42,245
Too small for you
to have secrets?

489
00:33:42,346 --> 00:33:44,484
<i>Well, secrets were
a bit difficult. </i>

490
00:33:44,586 --> 00:33:47,237
<i>-  But possible?
- Not for long. </i>

491
00:33:47,338 --> 00:33:52,041
Secrets require a privacy
that our little home did not provide.

492
00:33:52,138 --> 00:33:54,594
- Did you play games in your house?
- No.

493
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:58,147
We had to be quiet, usually,
because my father was preparing his sermon.

494
00:33:58,251 --> 00:34:01,863
But if he went out, we'd play
hide-and-seek all over the house.

495
00:34:01,964 --> 00:34:03,786
Oh, lovely!

496
00:34:03,884 --> 00:34:05,706
- Let's do that!
- All right.

497
00:34:05,804 --> 00:34:07,626
You hide, and I'll seek.

498
00:34:07,724 --> 00:34:09,994
We can go all over the house,
can't we?

499
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:12,875
- Everywhere, I mean.
- Yes, I should think so.

500
00:34:15,373 --> 00:34:18,156
Oh. Where are the children going?
It's their bedtime.

501
00:34:18,254 --> 00:34:20,076
Yes, I know.

502
00:34:20,174 --> 00:34:23,436
But I thought, just one little game
and then right to bed they'll go.

503
00:34:23,534 --> 00:34:25,836
Oh, they've won you over, miss,
already, I can see.

504
00:34:25,934 --> 00:34:27,757
They have indeed.

505
00:34:27,855 --> 00:34:30,473
<i>-  We're ready!
- I'm coming!</i>

506
00:34:47,568 --> 00:34:49,455
Anna?

507
00:34:54,865 --> 00:34:57,232
<i>Miss Giddens!</i>

508
00:36:11,832 --> 00:36:14,615
- You'd never have found me
if I hadn't pounced on you!

509
00:36:14,713 --> 00:36:17,102
- Did I frighten you?
- Yes, a bit.

510
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,630
- Now you're my prisoner.
- Oh, Miles!

511
00:36:19,737 --> 00:36:21,744
- Let me go.
- Why?

512
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,224
- You're hurting me.
- Am I?

513
00:36:23,322 --> 00:36:26,999
- Yes, Miles. Please let me go.
- But why?

514
00:36:27,098 --> 00:36:30,230
- I told you. You're hurting me. Miles, I mean it.
- Do you?

515
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,113
<i>Oh, you've found it! I've missed it so. </i>

516
00:36:33,211 --> 00:36:35,033
Mrs. Grose must have
hidden it here.

517
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:37,913
- Now it's your turn to hide.
- Hurry! Run!

518
00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:39,833
All right.

519
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,754
Now where?

520
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:45,649
- Oh, where shall I hide?
- Wherever you like. We'll count a hundred.

521
00:36:46,652 --> 00:36:49,783
One, two, three...

522
00:36:49,884 --> 00:36:54,456
four, five, six, seven, eight...

523
00:36:54,556 --> 00:36:58,550
<i>nine, 10, 11-</i>

524
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,495
<i>Miss Giddens!</i>

525
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:35,543
<i>Where are you?</i>

526
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:14,910
<i>Miss? Miss Giddens?</i>

527
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,883
Whatever are you
doing there, miss?

528
00:38:18,981 --> 00:38:20,803
Heavens, child,
you're white as milk.

529
00:38:20,901 --> 00:38:23,684
I saw him!
Don't tell me I didn't, because I did.

530
00:38:23,782 --> 00:38:25,604
- I saw him staring.
- Who, miss?

531
00:38:25,702 --> 00:38:28,004
- The same man- the man on the tower.
- The tower?

532
00:38:28,101 --> 00:38:30,884
But now, just now, he was staring past me
into the house...

533
00:38:30,982 --> 00:38:32,804
as if he were hunting someone.

534
00:38:32,902 --> 00:38:35,204
- What's he like, miss?
- He had dark, curling hair.

535
00:38:35,303 --> 00:38:37,605
- And the hardest, the coldest eyes.
- Is he-

536
00:38:37,702 --> 00:38:40,964
- Would you say he was very handsome?
- Oh yes. Handsome and obscene.

537
00:38:41,063 --> 00:38:43,038
But I've seen him before.
Yes, he-

538
00:38:43,143 --> 00:38:46,820
I know where I've seen him.
A picture. There's a picture of him.

539
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,702
A miniature in a cracked glass
in the attic.

540
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,622
- I'll show you.
- It can't be.

541
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,859
- It can't be? You know him.
- Quint.

542
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,099
- Peter Quint, the master's valet.
- But you said-

543
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,397
Yes, miss. You see, he's dead.
Quint is dead.

544
00:38:59,497 --> 00:39:01,319
Dead?

545
00:40:31,122 --> 00:40:34,024
Your pencil does have
the most terrible squeak, Flora.

546
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,912
It does, doesn't it?
But I can't help it, you know.

547
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,858
Can't you? I thought you were
doing it on purpose.

548
00:40:41,267 --> 00:40:43,569
She is.

549
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:46,449
<i>- Stop it! Stop begging!
- I'm not begging!</i>

550
00:40:46,547 --> 00:40:49,002
Yes, you are!
You're begging for attention!

551
00:40:49,108 --> 00:40:51,890
There you are, begging again.

552
00:40:51,988 --> 00:40:54,290
First for attention,
now for affection.

553
00:40:54,388 --> 00:40:56,690
- Stop it, Flora!
- Now, Miles. Hush, Miles.

554
00:40:56,788 --> 00:41:00,236
Oh, darling.
Oh, poor darling Flora.

555
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,795
There, now.
Look, I've made you cry.

556
00:41:02,901 --> 00:41:05,683
Oh, what a hateful,
what a grumpy old governess you have.

557
00:41:05,781 --> 00:41:07,537
You're not grumpy at all.

558
00:41:07,637 --> 00:41:10,420
Of course you're not.
Though I wouldn't wonder if you were.

559
00:41:10,517 --> 00:41:12,340
Nor would I,
with everything so horrible.

560
00:41:12,438 --> 00:41:14,740
Horrible?

561
00:41:14,837 --> 00:41:16,594
Why, yes.
You know, the rain.

562
00:41:16,694 --> 00:41:19,215
Not being able
to go out in the garden.

563
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:22,101
My squeaky pencil and me-
I wasn't even trying to be good.

564
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:24,021
<i>Oh, but you are good.</i>

565
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:26,388
You both are.

566
00:41:26,487 --> 00:41:28,309
I know what.

567
00:41:28,407 --> 00:41:31,407
Let's put away our books
and let's pretend it's Flora's birthday.

568
00:41:31,512 --> 00:41:33,814
- Oh, yes!
- All right, Flora, it's your birthday.

569
00:41:33,912 --> 00:41:36,214
- What would you like to do?
- Have a party.

570
00:41:36,312 --> 00:41:38,898
- A costume party.
- That's a splendid idea!

571
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,782
- Miles and I'll go get all dressed up.
- May we?

572
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,336
- Yes, of course you may.
- Come along then, Flora.

573
00:41:44,441 --> 00:41:46,263
<i>Oh, good!</i>

574
00:41:49,242 --> 00:41:51,096
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- Where are you going?

575
00:41:51,193 --> 00:41:53,976
<i>- To dress up! You said we might!
- Well, I'll come with you. </i>

576
00:41:54,074 --> 00:41:57,456
No! Then there'd be no surprise!
You wait downstairs! We won't be long!

577
00:41:57,562 --> 00:41:59,450
<i>Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!</i>

578
00:42:05,978 --> 00:42:07,801
I've let them go.

579
00:42:07,899 --> 00:42:09,873
- Go where, miss?
- Oh!

580
00:42:09,979 --> 00:42:12,183
Oh, I've let the children go.

581
00:42:12,284 --> 00:42:15,001
Upstairs,
to the attic, perhaps.

582
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,922
Alone.

583
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:20,850
- Is that all? They'll come to no harm.
- I can't.

584
00:42:20,956 --> 00:42:23,739
I can't leave them alone,
not after the other night.

585
00:42:23,837 --> 00:42:26,619
As for the other night, miss,
put it out of your mind.

586
00:42:26,717 --> 00:42:29,979
- Pretend it was part of a dream,
which perhaps it was.
- A dream?

587
00:42:30,078 --> 00:42:32,860
Don't you think
I want to believe that?

588
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:35,260
That it was just the darkness,
a nightmare?

589
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:39,253
But it's no longer dark.
It's daylight. And I know I saw him.

590
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:42,457
A man, or something
that once was a man...

591
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,854
peering in through the window,
looking for someone.

592
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,733
And if it isn't true,
if I didn't see him...

593
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:51,613
how could I have described him
so accurately?

594
00:42:51,711 --> 00:42:54,810
<i>Well, you had
seen his picture. </i>

595
00:42:54,912 --> 00:42:58,654
Really, miss, you're upsetting yourself
over nothing.

596
00:42:58,752 --> 00:43:00,574
You said he was the valet?

597
00:43:00,672 --> 00:43:02,494
Yes, but when the master left...

598
00:43:02,592 --> 00:43:04,415
Quint was alone with us,
in charge.

599
00:43:04,512 --> 00:43:07,295
Tell me, how did he die?

600
00:43:07,393 --> 00:43:09,215
Quint?

601
00:43:09,313 --> 00:43:12,030
Out there, miss,
on those very steps.

602
00:43:12,129 --> 00:43:13,951
It was winter.

603
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:16,832
The coldest,
blackest winter's night.

604
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:18,752
The steps were icy.

605
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:21,632
Quint, he came home late,
after we were all abed.

606
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,552
Late, and full of drink.

607
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:26,432
There was a wound on his head,
as if he'd slipped...

608
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,531
as if he'd fallen
out there in the dark.

609
00:43:29,635 --> 00:43:31,457
I can't forget his eyes.

610
00:43:31,555 --> 00:43:34,555
They were open,
filled with surprise...

611
00:43:34,659 --> 00:43:38,489
with pain, like the eyes of a fox
I once saw-

612
00:43:38,596 --> 00:43:41,379
a fox the dogs had hunted down.

613
00:43:41,477 --> 00:43:43,746
But it was an accident?

614
00:43:43,845 --> 00:43:45,667
He was a peculiar man.

615
00:43:45,765 --> 00:43:49,027
There were things in his life
that could account for violence done him...

616
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:50,947
vicious things-

617
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,242
Well, it doesn't do
to speak ill of the dead.

618
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:56,164
The children
never mention him?

619
00:43:56,262 --> 00:43:59,262
Oh, no, miss, and neither must you-
not to them.

620
00:43:59,366 --> 00:44:02,149
You see, miss, it was Master Miles
that found him.

621
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:04,069
Oh, that poor little boy.

622
00:44:04,167 --> 00:44:05,989
If you could have
heard his screams...

623
00:44:06,087 --> 00:44:08,804
seen the way he clung to him
and begged him to speak-

624
00:44:08,903 --> 00:44:10,878
That poor little boy
worshipped Quint.

625
00:44:10,983 --> 00:44:14,726
<i>Worshipped him?
That man? Miles?</i>

626
00:44:14,824 --> 00:44:17,377
You didn't know Quint, miss.

627
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,163
Such power he had over people.

628
00:44:20,264 --> 00:44:22,086
You can't blame the child.

629
00:44:22,184 --> 00:44:24,006
A lonely boy with no father.

630
00:44:24,104 --> 00:44:25,927
Quint took advantage,
that's all.

631
00:44:26,024 --> 00:44:29,025
It made me sick to see
Miles trotting after him like a little dog.

632
00:44:29,129 --> 00:44:30,952
They were always together.

633
00:44:31,049 --> 00:44:31,960
<i> Quiet, everyone. </i>

634
00:44:31,993 --> 00:44:32,870
<i> Quiet, everyone. </i>

635
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,523
The entertainment
is about to commence.

636
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:38,015
Oh, look, miss.

637
00:44:38,122 --> 00:44:40,424
I borrowed your pin cushion.

638
00:44:40,522 --> 00:44:42,562
I hope you don't mind.

639
00:44:44,202 --> 00:44:46,984
Miss Giddens, dear,
would you sit there?

640
00:44:47,082 --> 00:44:50,246
And, Mrs. Grose,
would you sit there too?

641
00:44:53,675 --> 00:44:56,523
And now Miles will recite to you.

642
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,024
A poem.

643
00:45:02,124 --> 00:45:06,086
What shall I sing to my lord
from my window?

644
00:45:06,188 --> 00:45:09,484
What shall I sing,
for my lord will not stay?

645
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:13,356
<i>What shall I sing,
for my lord will not listen?</i>

646
00:45:13,453 --> 00:45:17,065
Where shall I go,
for my lord is away?

647
00:45:18,574 --> 00:45:21,803
Whom shall I love
when the moon is arisen?

648
00:45:21,902 --> 00:45:24,236
<i>Gone is my lord... </i>

649
00:45:24,334 --> 00:45:26,953
<i>and the grave is his prison. </i>

650
00:45:27,054 --> 00:45:30,949
What shall I say
when my lord comes a-calling?

651
00:45:31,055 --> 00:45:34,983
What shall I say
when he knocks on my door?

652
00:45:35,087 --> 00:45:39,528
What shall I say
when his feet enter softly...

653
00:45:39,631 --> 00:45:43,526
<i>leaving the marks
of his grave on my floor?</i>

654
00:45:43,632 --> 00:45:45,541
<i>Enter, my lord. </i>

655
00:45:45,648 --> 00:45:48,169
Come from your prison.

656
00:45:48,272 --> 00:45:51,055
Come from your grave...

657
00:45:51,152 --> 00:45:53,935
for the moon is arisen.

658
00:45:54,033 --> 00:45:56,335
Welcome, my lord.

659
00:46:05,394 --> 00:46:07,216
Look at that.

660
00:46:07,314 --> 00:46:09,616
- What, miss?
- I was afraid for them.

661
00:46:09,715 --> 00:46:12,497
But what if he knows?
What if Miles knows?

662
00:46:12,595 --> 00:46:15,377
Knows what,
Miss Giddens, dear?

663
00:46:15,475 --> 00:46:17,297
You think I'm imagining it...

664
00:46:17,395 --> 00:46:20,178
and yet just now you yourself saw
and heard Miles-

665
00:46:20,276 --> 00:46:22,578
Playing a game.

666
00:46:22,675 --> 00:46:25,458
You told me
Quint and Miles were always together.

667
00:46:25,556 --> 00:46:27,378
But Master Miles
wasn't to blame for that.

668
00:46:27,476 --> 00:46:30,258
- Yes, but couldn't you have stopped it?
- I wasn't in charge, miss.

669
00:46:30,356 --> 00:46:33,073
It wasn't for me to question
the master's arrangements.

670
00:46:33,173 --> 00:46:34,995
The master
put Quint in charge here.

671
00:46:35,093 --> 00:46:38,410
Besides, no one
could go against Quint.

672
00:46:39,413 --> 00:46:41,301
You were afraid of him?

673
00:46:44,757 --> 00:46:46,580
But what of Miss Jessel?

674
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,500
Couldn't she
have done something?

675
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:50,900
Or was she afraid of him too?

676
00:46:50,999 --> 00:46:52,821
Not at first.
At least-

677
00:46:52,919 --> 00:46:57,229
In the beginning, when she first came here,
she was always happy and smiling.

678
00:46:57,336 --> 00:46:59,158
Very fond of music she was...

679
00:46:59,256 --> 00:47:01,012
and dancing.

680
00:47:01,112 --> 00:47:04,789
She and Miss Flora used to dance together,
dance by the hour.

681
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:06,710
But she changed.

682
00:47:06,808 --> 00:47:08,630
Oh, yes, she changed.

683
00:47:08,728 --> 00:47:10,551
'T was hard to believe...

684
00:47:10,648 --> 00:47:13,431
her being an educated young lady
and Quint being...

685
00:47:13,529 --> 00:47:15,831
well, what he was.

686
00:47:15,929 --> 00:47:17,752
<i>Stop it, Miles! Stop it!</i>

687
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:19,672
You see? I knew
they'd be overexcited.

688
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,592
It's long past their bedtime.

689
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:24,472
Yes, but what did you mean
about Quint and Miss Jessel?

690
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:26,905
Look, miss, they're dead, gone.

691
00:47:27,002 --> 00:47:30,351
There's no point in telling tales
of what's over and done with.

692
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,115
Over and done with?

693
00:47:40,028 --> 00:47:41,915
Yes, but is it?

694
00:48:11,518 --> 00:48:13,820
<i>Let go, Flora. You'll fall in. </i>

695
00:48:13,919 --> 00:48:15,926
<i>But I want to row the boat. </i>

696
00:48:16,031 --> 00:48:17,973
Silly.
You know you can't.

697
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,535
Miss Giddens, tell Miles
to let me row.

698
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:22,941
I will,
when you're a little older.

699
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,178
But it's too heavy
for you now.

700
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,444
I don't care.
I've got a boat of my own anyway.

701
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:36,764
Heavenly, warm sun.

702
00:48:36,865 --> 00:48:38,687
It's almost hot.

703
00:48:38,785 --> 00:48:41,568
<i>I like it when it's hot. </i>

704
00:48:41,665 --> 00:48:44,927
- Do you know what Miles told me once?
- No, dear. What?

705
00:48:45,025 --> 00:48:48,342
He said that once, when he was on the lake,
he could see a hand waving on the bottom.

706
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:51,964
<i>But Mrs. Grose said,
"Stuff and nonsense! Stuff and nonsense!"</i>

707
00:48:57,571 --> 00:48:59,905
Miss Giddens,
can tortoises swim?

708
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,825
No, dear.

709
00:49:01,923 --> 00:49:03,811
I thought
perhaps they couldn't.

710
00:49:15,429 --> 00:49:18,277
Flora, where did you
learn that song?

711
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:21,597
I don't think I remember.

712
00:49:25,734 --> 00:49:28,669
It's the song
from the music box, isn't it?

713
00:49:29,734 --> 00:49:31,261
Isn't it?

714
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,157
<i>Flora!</i>

715
00:49:57,257 --> 00:49:59,079
<i>Who is it?</i>

716
00:49:59,177 --> 00:50:01,544
Over there.

717
00:50:33,548 --> 00:50:37,127
Oh, goodness, miss, you gave me
quite a turn sitting there in the dark.

718
00:50:37,229 --> 00:50:41,124
- And where are the children?
- Upstairs with Anna.

719
00:50:41,229 --> 00:50:45,256
I wanted to be by myself
for a while, to think.

720
00:50:45,357 --> 00:50:49,002
Well, miss, I'm sure a little light
will make your thoughts more cheerful.

721
00:50:49,102 --> 00:50:53,674
Mrs. Grose?
There are two of them.

722
00:50:53,774 --> 00:50:55,683
I beg your pardon?

723
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:59,915
Two of those abominations.

724
00:51:01,135 --> 00:51:05,030
Today, down by the lake...

725
00:51:05,136 --> 00:51:07,819
there in the broad sunlight...

726
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,895
I saw the other one.

727
00:51:09,999 --> 00:51:13,644
- The other one?
- A woman dressed in black.

728
00:51:15,152 --> 00:51:17,934
- Miss Jessel.
- Oh, but Miss Jessel's dead.

729
00:51:18,032 --> 00:51:20,651
She died, why, almost a year ago.

730
00:51:20,753 --> 00:51:23,917
Huh. Almost a year ago.

731
00:51:24,017 --> 00:51:26,668
Almost a year.

732
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:28,679
Flora saw her too.

733
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:30,696
- Did she tell you so?
- No, of course not.

734
00:51:30,802 --> 00:51:33,169
She lied to me.
Well, it amounted to a lie.

735
00:51:33,266 --> 00:51:37,161
Oh, now, miss, I've never known
either of the children to tell lies.

736
00:51:37,267 --> 00:51:39,241
- Why would they?
- Why?

737
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:42,064
Because they are both playing...

738
00:51:42,163 --> 00:51:45,808
or being made to play
some monstrous game.

739
00:51:45,907 --> 00:51:48,329
I can't pretend to understand
what its purpose is.

740
00:51:48,436 --> 00:51:50,672
I only know that it is happening.

741
00:51:50,772 --> 00:51:55,595
Something secretive
and whispery...

742
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,610
and indecent.

743
00:51:57,716 --> 00:52:01,907
I tell you, believe me,
the children are in dreadful peril.

744
00:52:02,005 --> 00:52:04,460
Well, what are we to do?

745
00:52:04,565 --> 00:52:06,388
Then you do believe me?

746
00:52:06,486 --> 00:52:09,104
You don't think I'm imagining it?

747
00:52:09,206 --> 00:52:13,811
- I believe you, miss.
- Oh, thank God. Thank God.

748
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:16,594
I've been so frightened.
I've felt so alone.

749
00:52:16,695 --> 00:52:19,215
But together,
with you to help me-

750
00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:21,686
Oh, yes, miss, I'll help you.
Only tell me how.

751
00:52:21,783 --> 00:52:23,954
Yes.

752
00:52:24,055 --> 00:52:28,812
We must try to learn
what it is these horrors want.

753
00:52:31,032 --> 00:52:35,255
Think, Mrs. Grose.
The answer must lie in the past.

754
00:52:37,752 --> 00:52:41,976
Were Quint
and Miss Jessel in love?

755
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:48,018
They were in love, weren't they?

756
00:52:48,122 --> 00:52:51,089
Love? Oh, I suppose
that's what she called it.

757
00:52:51,194 --> 00:52:53,234
But it was more
like a sickness...

758
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:58,488
a fever that leaves the body
burned out and dry.

759
00:52:58,586 --> 00:53:01,074
There was no cruelty
she wouldn't suffer.

760
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,561
If he struck her- Oh, yes,
and I've seen him knock her to the floor-

761
00:53:04,667 --> 00:53:08,922
she'd look at him as though
she wanted the weight of his hand.

762
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,737
No pride, no shame.

763
00:53:11,835 --> 00:53:14,137
<i>Crawl to him on her hands and knees,
she would. </i>

764
00:53:14,236 --> 00:53:18,514
<i>And him laughing at her. 
Such a savage laugh he had. </i>

765
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:22,549
Oh, it hurts me to remember.

766
00:53:22,652 --> 00:53:26,450
Bad she was, but no woman
could have suffered more.

767
00:53:26,557 --> 00:53:30,998
<i>A person ought to
keep quiet about it. </i>

768
00:53:31,101 --> 00:53:33,338
You must tell me.

769
00:53:33,438 --> 00:53:37,748
Oh, miss, there's things
I've seen I- I'm ashamed to say.

770
00:53:37,854 --> 00:53:39,829
Go on.

771
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:44,027
Rooms...

772
00:53:44,126 --> 00:53:46,647
used by daylight...

773
00:53:46,751 --> 00:53:49,085
as though
they were dark woods.

774
00:53:52,032 --> 00:53:54,715
They didn't care
that you saw them?

775
00:53:56,544 --> 00:53:59,000
And the children?

776
00:53:59,104 --> 00:54:04,026
I can't say, miss.
I- I don't know what the children saw.

777
00:54:04,128 --> 00:54:06,584
But they used to follow
Quint and Miss Jessel...

778
00:54:06,689 --> 00:54:09,210
trailing along behind
hand in hand, whispering.

779
00:54:09,313 --> 00:54:11,769
There was too much whispering
in this house, miss.

780
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:14,208
<i>Oh, yes, I can imagine. </i>

781
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:17,785
Yes, I can imagine
what sort of things...

782
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:19,745
they whispered about.

783
00:54:19,842 --> 00:54:24,217
Quint, Miles.
I can hear them together.

784
00:54:24,323 --> 00:54:27,422
But there was nothing wrong
in Master Miles wanting to be with Quint.

785
00:54:27,523 --> 00:54:29,944
Quint taught him to ride
and took him walking.

786
00:54:30,051 --> 00:54:33,117
- The poor lad needed someone to-
- To corrupt him?

787
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,456
But Master Miles
is a good boy, miss.

788
00:54:35,555 --> 00:54:37,922
- There's nothing wicked in him.
- Unless he's deceiving us.

789
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,442
Unless they're both deceiving us.

790
00:54:40,549 --> 00:54:43,364
- The innocents.
- Innocents they are, miss.

791
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,762
It's not fair.
You have no right to accuse them of-

792
00:54:45,861 --> 00:54:48,228
Oh, forgive me, Mrs. Grose.
I'm not accusing.

793
00:54:48,325 --> 00:54:53,214
I'm just trying to put it together,
to understand.

794
00:54:53,317 --> 00:54:56,100
Tell me, were the children happy?

795
00:54:56,198 --> 00:54:58,238
Oh, they seemed to be.
The same as now.

796
00:54:58,342 --> 00:55:02,020
But sometimes I used to wonder if
they really cared for them, those two...

797
00:55:02,118 --> 00:55:05,152
or if they weren't
just using them.

798
00:55:06,215 --> 00:55:08,703
Using them?

799
00:55:08,807 --> 00:55:11,524
Yes, of course they were...

800
00:55:11,624 --> 00:55:13,566
and still are.

801
00:55:14,952 --> 00:55:17,286
And in the end, what happened to her,
Miss Jessel?

802
00:55:17,384 --> 00:55:20,068
Oh, that was pitiful.

803
00:55:20,168 --> 00:55:24,260
When Quint was found,
she went into blackest mourning.

804
00:55:24,361 --> 00:55:26,881
Her, that should have
hated the man.

805
00:55:26,985 --> 00:55:30,247
She grieved till there was something
crazy in her eyes.

806
00:55:30,345 --> 00:55:32,614
<i>Never slept. 
Never ate. </i>

807
00:55:32,713 --> 00:55:36,161
<i>I used to hear her wandering about
all over the house, sobbing. </i>

808
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:40,101
<i>Couldn't go on. </i>

809
00:55:40,202 --> 00:55:42,722
<i>Finally she died. </i>

810
00:55:42,826 --> 00:55:46,601
Here? At Bly?
But of what did she die?

811
00:55:46,699 --> 00:55:50,344
Well, I suppose
you might say a broken heart.

812
00:55:50,443 --> 00:55:52,679
Excuse me, miss.
They're in bed now.

813
00:55:52,779 --> 00:55:55,649
All scrubbed and nice and waiting
for you to hear their prayers.

814
00:55:55,755 --> 00:55:57,578
Thank you, Anna.
I shall be up in a moment.

815
00:55:57,675 --> 00:56:00,742
One thing more before I go.

816
00:56:00,844 --> 00:56:03,016
- Yes, miss?
- Our local vicar, what sort of man is he?

817
00:56:03,117 --> 00:56:06,794
The Reverend Fennel?
Oh, he's a very fine sort of gentleman, miss.

818
00:56:06,893 --> 00:56:08,715
Oh, but, miss,
I wouldn't do that.

819
00:56:08,813 --> 00:56:12,162
I- I mean, if you were thinking of discussing
with the vicar what we have been discussing...

820
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:14,212
oh, I wouldn't, miss.

821
00:56:14,317 --> 00:56:18,890
- Why not?
- Well, it might cause talk, a scandal.

822
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:21,260
Haven't we worse to fear
than a scandal?

823
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:27,022
But what good would it do, miss, telling
the vicar our secrets? He can't help us.

824
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,639
He's perhaps
the only one who can.

825
00:56:37,903 --> 00:56:41,930
<i> What good would it do, miss,
telling the vicar our secrets?</i>

826
00:56:42,032 --> 00:56:44,105
<i>He can't help us. </i>

827
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:47,950
<i> Only remember,
you are in supreme authority. </i>

828
00:56:48,048 --> 00:56:50,667
Shh. Flora,
it's a secret.

829
00:56:50,769 --> 00:56:53,388
You must remember
it's a secret.

830
00:57:01,489 --> 00:57:03,312
Watch her.

831
00:57:04,786 --> 00:57:06,608
Watch her.

832
00:57:06,706 --> 00:57:10,503
Flora, it's a secret. It's a secret.

833
00:57:35,061 --> 00:57:38,509
It's a secret.
A secret.

834
00:58:06,104 --> 00:58:08,439
I've made up my mind.

835
00:58:08,537 --> 00:58:12,181
Right after church, I shall take the next train
to London and see their uncle.

836
00:58:12,281 --> 00:58:15,184
- He must have returned.
- But why, miss? Why now?

837
00:58:15,289 --> 00:58:19,512
Because I-
We can go on no longer without help.

838
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:22,261
I know you're almost sick with worry,
but accept for odd times...

839
00:58:22,362 --> 00:58:24,369
you can't say the children
haven't been good.

840
00:58:24,474 --> 00:58:27,769
But they haven't been good,
merely easy to live with.

841
00:58:27,866 --> 00:58:31,958
Because they are not living with us.
We have no part in their real life.

842
00:58:32,059 --> 00:58:35,026
Dear Mrs. Grose, I know it's hard for you
to think wrong of those children...

843
00:58:35,131 --> 00:58:39,255
but there are things
that I haven't told you...

844
00:58:39,356 --> 00:58:42,356
that I can't bring myself
to tell even you.

845
00:58:42,459 --> 00:58:44,794
Look at them.

846
00:58:44,892 --> 00:58:46,997
<i>What do you think they're saying?</i>

847
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,588
Well, I don't know, miss.
Just children's talk.

848
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,515
They're talking about them.

849
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:54,362
<i>Talking horrors. </i>

850
00:58:55,581 --> 00:58:57,971
So far these monsters
have kept their distance.

851
00:58:58,077 --> 00:58:59,899
Only been seen in high places...

852
00:58:59,997 --> 00:59:02,201
through windows, across the lake.

853
00:59:02,302 --> 00:59:06,012
But they intend coming closer.
And if they do-

854
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:09,405
- What will you say to the master?
- Well, what can I say?

855
00:59:09,502 --> 00:59:11,542
That his house is being poisoned?

856
00:59:11,647 --> 00:59:14,844
That the children are
a pair of calculating liars?

857
00:59:14,942 --> 00:59:17,310
That they have friends
who would frighten them out of their lives...

858
00:59:17,407 --> 00:59:19,775
if they weren't deeply
and forever bound to them?

859
00:59:19,871 --> 00:59:22,293
Oh, yes, I know,
he'll think I'm insane...

860
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,142
or that it's some stupid trick
to get him to notice me.

861
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,509
Oh, I wish there was
something I could do to help.

862
00:59:28,608 --> 00:59:32,732
There is.
Have you told me everything?

863
00:59:32,832 --> 00:59:36,510
If I am to convince their uncle,
I must have the truth.

864
00:59:36,609 --> 00:59:38,846
All the truth.

865
00:59:38,945 --> 00:59:40,800
How did Miss Jessel die?

866
00:59:40,898 --> 00:59:43,102
Please, miss, we'll be late.

867
00:59:45,122 --> 00:59:47,543
How did she die?

868
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:51,839
In wickedness.

869
00:59:51,938 --> 00:59:56,314
She put an end to herself.
She was found in the lake, drowned.

870
00:59:57,892 --> 01:00:00,575
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.
I- I should never have told you.

871
01:00:00,675 --> 01:00:03,490
I'm glad you did.

872
01:00:03,588 --> 01:00:06,904
Oh, go in, Mrs. Grose.
I'll follow you in a moment.

873
01:00:40,455 --> 01:00:42,277
Flora.

874
01:00:50,472 --> 01:00:54,302
I do wish you wouldn't go, miss. It seems
wrong somehow, your hurrying off like this.

875
01:00:54,409 --> 01:00:57,725
I'm left with no choice.
Thank you, Mrs. Grose.

876
01:00:57,833 --> 01:00:59,655
There's nothing else
to be done...

877
01:00:59,753 --> 01:01:03,398
except to go to their uncle, tell him
everything and force him to understand.

878
01:01:03,497 --> 01:01:05,799
- Did you order the carriage for me?
- I did, miss.

879
01:01:05,898 --> 01:01:08,713
I'll go and see if it's come around.
I'll get someone to take your luggage down.

880
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:11,177
Thank you.
I shall be in the schoolroom.

881
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:25,392
<i>Miss Giddens?</i>

882
01:02:26,482 --> 01:02:28,456
Miss Giddens?

883
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:42,379
Are you ready, miss?

884
01:02:42,483 --> 01:02:44,458
I'm not going.

885
01:02:44,563 --> 01:02:46,505
Everything has changed.

886
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,350
Are you ill?

887
01:02:50,452 --> 01:02:53,103
- Where are the children?
- Anna's giving them their milk.

888
01:02:53,204 --> 01:02:55,114
The carriage is ready, miss.

889
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:57,970
From now on, we must never let them
out of our sight.

890
01:02:58,069 --> 01:03:00,305
We can't take
the slightest chance.

891
01:03:00,405 --> 01:03:02,260
Of what?

892
01:03:02,357 --> 01:03:04,430
She was here.

893
01:03:04,533 --> 01:03:06,476
She was waiting for me.

894
01:03:06,581 --> 01:03:08,403
Who?

895
01:03:08,501 --> 01:03:11,917
- She spoke.
- She spoke?

896
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:14,641
It came to that.

897
01:03:14,742 --> 01:03:17,742
Oh, I could feel pity for her...

898
01:03:17,846 --> 01:03:21,589
if she herself
were not so pitiless.

899
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,415
And hungry.
Hungry for him.

900
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,454
For his arms...

901
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,731
and his lips.

902
01:03:31,832 --> 01:03:34,069
But she can only reach him...

903
01:03:34,168 --> 01:03:37,681
they can only reach each other
by entering the souls of the children...

904
01:03:37,785 --> 01:03:39,640
and possessing them.

905
01:03:42,681 --> 01:03:45,496
The children are possessed.

906
01:03:46,553 --> 01:03:49,782
They live and know...

907
01:03:49,882 --> 01:03:52,752
and share this hell.

908
01:03:52,858 --> 01:03:54,746
Then surely
you must tell the master.

909
01:03:54,842 --> 01:03:56,664
I can't leave them now.

910
01:03:56,762 --> 01:04:00,243
I shall write to him and insist upon
his coming down here.

911
01:04:00,346 --> 01:04:03,129
But even if he chooses
to ignore me...

912
01:04:03,227 --> 01:04:06,772
with or without his help,
I think I know how we can save them.

913
01:04:06,875 --> 01:04:10,902
- Yes, miss?
- They must be made to admit what is happening.

914
01:04:11,004 --> 01:04:13,525
One word, one word of the truth
from these children...

915
01:04:13,628 --> 01:04:16,182
and we can cast out
those devils forever.

916
01:04:16,284 --> 01:04:18,706
I pray to God
you're right, miss.

917
01:05:05,057 --> 01:05:07,097
<i>Shh. </i>

918
01:05:09,602 --> 01:05:12,668
<i>Softly. The children are listening. </i>

919
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,287
<i>He had a wound on his head as if he’d slipped. </i>

920
01:06:17,384 --> 01:06:19,839
<i>I can't forget his eyes-
they were open. </i>

921
01:06:19,944 --> 01:06:23,589
<i>What shall I say when his feet enter softly... </i>

922
01:06:23,689 --> 01:06:27,235
<i>leaving the marks of his grave
on my floor?</i>

923
01:06:47,947 --> 01:06:50,947
<i>Kiss me. Kiss me. </i>

924
01:06:51,051 --> 01:06:53,834
<i>Kiss me. Kiss me. 
Kiss me. </i>

925
01:07:30,607 --> 01:07:34,022
<i>Look at the children. </i>

926
01:07:34,128 --> 01:07:35,950
<i>Look at the children. </i>

927
01:07:47,057 --> 01:07:49,479
<i>You're hurting me. </i>

928
01:08:14,804 --> 01:08:17,455
<i>The children are watching. </i>

929
01:08:17,555 --> 01:08:20,076
<i>The children are watching. </i>

930
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:23,376
<i>The children are watching. </i>

931
01:08:23,476 --> 01:08:27,503
<i> Haven't they taught you?
Knock before you enter. </i>

932
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:29,427
<i>Knock before you enter. </i>

933
01:08:29,524 --> 01:08:31,914
<i>Knock before you enter. </i>

934
01:08:52,759 --> 01:08:57,135
<i>Love me! Love me! Love me!</i>

935
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:00,306
<i>Love me! Love me!</i>

936
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,168
<i>Quint is dead. </i>

937
01:09:24,314 --> 01:09:26,136
Flora!

938
01:09:31,099 --> 01:09:33,074
Flora!

939
01:09:33,179 --> 01:09:35,962
Somebody's walking in the garden.

940
01:09:41,852 --> 01:09:45,267
<i>Miles!</i>

941
01:10:25,248 --> 01:10:27,223
Oh!

942
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:34,175
Miles, what were you doing?

943
01:10:34,273 --> 01:10:36,096
- When?
- You were looking up at the tower.

944
01:10:36,193 --> 01:10:38,016
- You saw something.
- Of course I did.

945
01:10:38,114 --> 01:10:39,969
- What did you see?
- Only you, Miss Giddens.

946
01:10:40,065 --> 01:10:42,848
- I was waiting for you.
- Waiting?

947
01:10:42,946 --> 01:10:47,070
Oh, I knew you'd look out.
But don't you want to know why?

948
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:50,017
I'll tell you the real, true reason.

949
01:10:50,114 --> 01:10:51,937
But I wonder if you'll understand.

950
01:10:52,035 --> 01:10:53,857
I'll try.

951
01:10:53,955 --> 01:10:58,014
Well, put me back to bed then,
if you're not too cross.

952
01:10:58,115 --> 01:11:00,090
- Are you cross?
- Yes, I am.

953
01:11:00,196 --> 01:11:04,091
I thought you would be.
Come on. I'll tell you when I'm in bed.

954
01:11:06,436 --> 01:11:08,258
- Well, now-
- Yes?

955
01:11:08,356 --> 01:11:12,219
- I wanted you to think me bad for a change.
- For a change?

956
01:11:12,325 --> 01:11:16,002
Well, I thought I might be
becoming a bore.

957
01:11:16,101 --> 01:11:18,949
Miles, tell me the truth.

958
01:11:19,046 --> 01:11:23,902
But I am. I mean, good children
do get a bit boring, don't they?

959
01:11:24,006 --> 01:11:28,578
So I thought, why not go out tonight
and wander about in my bare feet?

960
01:11:28,678 --> 01:11:31,908
It was a shocking thing
to do, wasn't it?

961
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:36,128
Yes, very shocking.

962
01:11:36,231 --> 01:11:39,581
Well, that was our plan.
Flora and I arranged it together.

963
01:11:39,687 --> 01:11:43,266
But we giggled so.
I was sure you must have heard us.

964
01:11:43,367 --> 01:11:46,215
Yes, I-I did hear something.

965
01:11:46,312 --> 01:11:48,134
I told her to go
over to the window...

966
01:11:48,232 --> 01:11:50,982
then you'd be bound
to look out and see me.

967
01:11:51,081 --> 01:11:53,764
Flora's been bad as well.

968
01:11:53,865 --> 01:11:57,608
Miles, what are you hiding
under your pillow?

969
01:11:57,705 --> 01:12:01,022
<i>I'm not hiding it. 
I'm keeping it warm. </i>

970
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:04,512
I found it this morning,
one of my pigeons.

971
01:12:04,618 --> 01:12:07,618
I couldn't, could I,
leave it out there alone?

972
01:12:07,722 --> 01:12:09,544
But, Miles...

973
01:12:09,642 --> 01:12:13,636
its neck.

974
01:12:13,738 --> 01:12:17,481
- It looks as though-
- Someone had broken it.

975
01:12:20,459 --> 01:12:22,881
Yes, poor thing.
I'll bury it tomorrow.

976
01:12:25,548 --> 01:12:28,167
Kiss me good night,
Miss Giddens.

977
01:12:55,278 --> 01:12:58,126
Are you writing
to your sister, Miss Giddens?

978
01:12:58,223 --> 01:13:00,525
No, Miles, to your uncle.

979
01:13:00,623 --> 01:13:03,972
I knew you would finally.

980
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:06,087
Did you?

981
01:13:06,192 --> 01:13:09,487
I suppose you're telling him
what a wicked boy I've been.

982
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:13,776
It concerns you, in part, yes.

983
01:13:13,872 --> 01:13:17,320
Well, do be sure
and give him my love.

984
01:13:19,953 --> 01:13:24,776
Miles, isn't that the tune
that Flora's always singing?

985
01:13:24,881 --> 01:13:26,856
<i>Do you like it?</i>

986
01:13:33,394 --> 01:13:35,304
Where is Flora?

987
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,615
Isn't she here?

988
01:13:37,714 --> 01:13:39,951
Shall I play you something else?

989
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:43,763
Flora!

990
01:13:45,684 --> 01:13:47,626
Flora!

991
01:13:47,732 --> 01:13:49,968
<i>Flora!</i>

992
01:13:50,068 --> 01:13:52,785
Mrs. Grose! Mrs. Grose!
Flora, she's gone!

993
01:13:52,884 --> 01:13:56,681
Miles planned it beautifully. Oh, yes,
it was very clever. Quick, we must find her.

994
01:13:56,789 --> 01:13:58,644
- Where?
- By the lake where we picnic.

995
01:13:58,741 --> 01:14:00,683
Where we saw Miss Jessel!

996
01:14:02,389 --> 01:14:05,772
<i>- You see? She's taken the boat.
- All alone, that child?</i>

997
01:14:05,877 --> 01:14:08,812
She's not alone.
And at such time, she's not a child.

998
01:14:08,918 --> 01:14:10,740
She's an old, old woman.

999
01:15:15,964 --> 01:15:18,932
<i>- Flora?
- Oh, there you are.</i>

1000
01:15:19,036 --> 01:15:21,720
<i>I thought someone
was watching me. </i>

1001
01:15:21,821 --> 01:15:24,374
And who did you think it was?

1002
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:26,812
Why, Miss Giddens,
you came out without your hat.

1003
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:29,976
So did you.

1004
01:15:30,078 --> 01:15:33,112
- How did you get here, dear?
- In the boat.

1005
01:15:33,214 --> 01:15:35,069
<i>Miss? Miss Giddens?</i>

1006
01:15:35,166 --> 01:15:38,101
And when did you learn
to row, Flora?

1007
01:15:39,263 --> 01:15:42,678
Miles taught me.

1008
01:15:42,783 --> 01:15:44,670
Why did you come here?

1009
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:48,183
I always come here when I want to dance,
when I want to be alone.

1010
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:52,378
And who gave you that music box?

1011
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:55,546
<i>- I don't think I remember.
- Miss Giddens?</i>

1012
01:15:55,648 --> 01:15:58,136
Oh, yes, I do.
It was Mrs. Grose.

1013
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,891
<i>- No, it was not.
- Wasn't it, Miss Giddens, dear?</i>

1014
01:16:02,113 --> 01:16:05,594
And where, my pet,
is Miss Jessel?

1015
01:16:05,697 --> 01:16:08,218
Where is she, Flora?

1016
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:11,552
<i>Miss Giddens?</i>

1017
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,537
Where is she?
You know you can see her!

1018
01:16:13,634 --> 01:16:17,050
- Miss?
- Look, Flora, look! There!

1019
01:16:17,154 --> 01:16:19,610
- You know you can see her.
- I can't! I can't!

1020
01:16:19,715 --> 01:16:22,530
Admit it! She's there!
You know you can see her!

1021
01:16:22,627 --> 01:16:24,896
- I can't! I can't!
- But look! She's there!

1022
01:16:24,995 --> 01:16:26,850
- Stop it! I'm frightened!
- Stop it, miss.

1023
01:16:28,867 --> 01:16:32,512
But you can see her. You must!

1024
01:16:32,612 --> 01:16:36,605
<i>Hush, hush, dear. She isn't there. 
How could she be?</i>

1025
01:16:36,708 --> 01:16:38,880
She's dead and buried.
Hush, little lamb.

1026
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:43,421
I can't see anything! I've never seen anything!
You're cruel! You're wicked!

1027
01:16:43,525 --> 01:16:46,045
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you!

1028
01:16:46,149 --> 01:16:47,872
<i>- Flora!
- Take me away from her. </i>

1029
01:16:47,973 --> 01:16:51,421
She's cruel! Take me away!
Please take me away!

1030
01:16:51,526 --> 01:16:55,072
Don't look at her! Don't look at her!
She frightens me so!

1031
01:16:55,174 --> 01:16:57,793
- Hush, dear. Come on.

1032
01:16:57,894 --> 01:17:01,856
Mrs. Grose!

1033
01:17:05,479 --> 01:17:07,454
Come along.

1034
01:17:56,620 --> 01:18:00,614
I like it when the fire
does that. Don't you?

1035
01:18:47,057 --> 01:18:51,400
<i>Shh. Hush, my love. Anna will stay with you. </i>

1036
01:19:07,251 --> 01:19:09,902
I've never known the equal.
Never. It's beyond nature.

1037
01:19:10,004 --> 01:19:11,891
Now do you believe me?
Now that you've seen?

1038
01:19:11,987 --> 01:19:13,897
Now that I've heard.
In all my years-

1039
01:19:14,003 --> 01:19:17,582
and I've known a vile tongue or two in my time-
never have I heard such obscenities.

1040
01:19:17,684 --> 01:19:20,532
That pleases you?

1041
01:19:20,628 --> 01:19:23,694
No, of course not, but it justifies me.
It's proof.

1042
01:19:23,797 --> 01:19:27,856
Perhaps it is, but to hear such filth
from a child's mouth...

1043
01:19:27,957 --> 01:19:30,543
I don't know where
she could have learned such language.

1044
01:19:30,645 --> 01:19:33,809
- I know.
- I never heard her speak like it before. Never.

1045
01:19:33,909 --> 01:19:36,560
<i>- Till you came. 
- You saw who taught her.</i>

1046
01:19:36,662 --> 01:19:40,940
- You saw that woman.
- I know what I saw.

1047
01:19:41,046 --> 01:19:43,894
Has she mentioned it?
Mentioned Miss Jessel?

1048
01:19:43,991 --> 01:19:47,122
- Only to say there was no one there.
- You pretended to believe her.

1049
01:19:47,223 --> 01:19:50,223
I didn't have to pretend.

1050
01:19:51,543 --> 01:19:54,031
Well, how can you say that?

1051
01:19:54,135 --> 01:19:58,194
As though you-you too
were a complete innocent?

1052
01:19:58,296 --> 01:20:01,078
<i>Well, you lived here. 
You knew those two. </i>

1053
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:04,111
You knew them when they were alive,
and what influence they were on the children.

1054
01:20:04,217 --> 01:20:08,308
And it frightened you.
When I came here, you were still frightened.

1055
01:20:08,409 --> 01:20:10,613
Oh, you were.
I sensed it. And why?

1056
01:20:10,713 --> 01:20:13,747
Because you felt
they weren't really dead.

1057
01:20:13,849 --> 01:20:16,632
And now, despite all that,
you turn on me.

1058
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:18,552
You blame me.

1059
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:21,138
And all I want to do is save the children,
not destroy them.

1060
01:20:21,242 --> 01:20:24,025
- Don't you know that?
- All I know is Miss Flora
was a sweet, innocent child...

1061
01:20:24,123 --> 01:20:26,195
a happy child, until
you made her face that-

1062
01:20:26,299 --> 01:20:30,838
- That woman! Say it!
- That bad memory!

1063
01:20:32,987 --> 01:20:35,376
It may have been the saving of her.

1064
01:20:35,484 --> 01:20:39,193
But you must take her to her uncle.

1065
01:20:39,292 --> 01:20:41,300
You must both go away tomorrow.

1066
01:20:41,404 --> 01:20:45,234
Away from me, away from them,
the servants- everyone must go.

1067
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:48,024
Leave you here all alone?

1068
01:20:48,125 --> 01:20:52,151
Except for Miles.

1069
01:20:52,253 --> 01:20:55,003
We were together this afternoon...

1070
01:20:55,102 --> 01:20:57,785
sitting in front of the fire.

1071
01:20:57,886 --> 01:21:00,025
He didn't say anything...

1072
01:21:00,126 --> 01:21:02,395
but he wanted to.

1073
01:21:02,494 --> 01:21:04,861
It was like a pendulum...

1074
01:21:04,959 --> 01:21:08,025
and I could feel it
swinging my way.

1075
01:21:08,127 --> 01:21:11,356
Slowly, slowly.

1076
01:21:11,455 --> 01:21:16,245
Oh, yes, he wanted to reveal himself
and ask for my help.

1077
01:21:16,351 --> 01:21:21,021
And we must give him that chance.
Don't you understand that?

1078
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,324
After today, miss,
I doubt I shall ever understand you.

1079
01:21:23,424 --> 01:21:25,791
It was a cruel thing.
And if you're planning another cruelty-

1080
01:21:25,888 --> 01:21:29,205
But to wake a child out of a bad dream,
is that a cruelty?

1081
01:21:29,313 --> 01:21:32,347
If you were my age...

1082
01:21:32,449 --> 01:21:35,035
and had cared for
as many children as I have...

1083
01:21:35,137 --> 01:21:38,999
you'd know that waking a child can sometimes
be worse than any bad dream.

1084
01:21:39,106 --> 01:21:40,764
<i>- No.
- It's the shock. </i>

1085
01:21:40,866 --> 01:21:44,215
And then being suddenly deprived.

1086
01:21:44,323 --> 01:21:46,494
No, you're wrong.
You're talking nonsense.

1087
01:21:46,595 --> 01:21:48,799
As you say, miss.

1088
01:21:48,899 --> 01:21:51,320
You and Flora
will leave tomorrow.

1089
01:21:51,427 --> 01:21:54,689
It is my decision.
I shall send the servants away.

1090
01:21:54,788 --> 01:21:59,043
He put me in charge-
in sole charge, Mrs. Grose.

1091
01:21:59,139 --> 01:22:03,068
Tomorrow
I must be alone here with Miles.

1092
01:22:04,868 --> 01:22:07,585
Miss, may I ask what I am
to tell their uncle?

1093
01:22:09,477 --> 01:22:11,517
The truth.

1094
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:14,555
The truth?

1095
01:22:15,941 --> 01:22:19,008
Yes, miss.
Thank you.

1096
01:22:35,719 --> 01:22:38,501
Mrs. Grose,
have you got my letter?

1097
01:22:38,599 --> 01:22:41,567
- What letter, miss?
- To their uncle. I left it on the desk.

1098
01:22:41,672 --> 01:22:43,614
Oh, I haven't touched it, miss.

1099
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,662
Well, I wonder who-

1100
01:22:45,769 --> 01:22:48,584
Oh, of course- Miles.

1101
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:51,266
- You're accusing him of stealing?
- Well, what matter.

1102
01:22:51,369 --> 01:22:55,559
It's just one thing more for us
to talk about when we're alone.

1103
01:22:55,657 --> 01:22:59,367
- Where is Master Miles?
- He went out early this morning.

1104
01:22:59,466 --> 01:23:01,605
But I shall wait for him.

1105
01:23:01,706 --> 01:23:04,739
He'll come to me.

1106
01:23:04,842 --> 01:23:09,479
Well, I-I suppose
Miss Flora and I had best be on our way.

1107
01:23:10,731 --> 01:23:12,771
<i>Give her my love... </i>

1108
01:23:12,875 --> 01:23:14,697
when she's better.

1109
01:23:14,795 --> 01:23:19,945
And, Mrs. Grose, please,
wait till you see Miles again...

1110
01:23:20,043 --> 01:23:21,866
before you judge me.

1111
01:23:21,963 --> 01:23:23,786
<i>I can’t judge you, miss. </i>

1112
01:23:23,884 --> 01:23:26,567
A body can only judge themselves.

1113
01:23:28,556 --> 01:23:31,852
May God be with you, miss.

1114
01:25:47,482 --> 01:25:49,784
So, here you are.

1115
01:25:49,882 --> 01:25:53,014
I say, are we
having tea in here?

1116
01:25:53,114 --> 01:25:56,497
- Yes, Miles.
- How very grand and grown-up.

1117
01:25:56,603 --> 01:26:00,913
Yes, and we can
talk together now, like adults.

1118
01:26:01,019 --> 01:26:04,598
Jolly nice, I call it.

1119
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:08,180
I feel quite
the master of the house.

1120
01:26:08,284 --> 01:26:10,291
Where are the servants?

1121
01:26:10,396 --> 01:26:12,218
They've gone home.

1122
01:26:12,316 --> 01:26:16,757
Oh, did you send them,
or did they take fright and run away?

1123
01:26:16,861 --> 01:26:18,683
What do you mean?

1124
01:26:18,781 --> 01:26:23,222
Well, you're afraid,
and perhaps you made them so.

1125
01:26:23,325 --> 01:26:26,708
And of what-
assuming you are right-

1126
01:26:26,813 --> 01:26:28,821
of what am I afraid, Miles?

1127
01:26:28,926 --> 01:26:32,854
I'm not a mind reader, my dear.
I've told you that before.

1128
01:26:32,959 --> 01:26:34,999
But I do sense things.

1129
01:26:36,702 --> 01:26:39,605
<i>Don't worry. 
There's a man in the house. </i>

1130
01:26:39,711 --> 01:26:41,533
Is there?

1131
01:26:41,631 --> 01:26:44,250
Yes, me.
I'll protect you.

1132
01:26:49,888 --> 01:26:52,474
I say, it is fun.

1133
01:26:52,576 --> 01:26:55,259
<i>We've got the whole house
to ourselves. </i>

1134
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:59,801
More or less.
There are still the others.

1135
01:27:01,121 --> 01:27:03,488
Poor Flora.
Is she awfully ill?

1136
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:05,407
I mean, is it serious?

1137
01:27:05,505 --> 01:27:07,447
<i>Has she gone to hospital?</i>

1138
01:27:07,554 --> 01:27:09,975
No, just to London.

1139
01:27:10,082 --> 01:27:13,431
I think Bly
didn't agree with her anymore.

1140
01:27:13,539 --> 01:27:16,190
- This house upset her.
- Suddenly?

1141
01:27:16,290 --> 01:27:18,113
Oh, no, I had seen it
coming on.

1142
01:27:18,211 --> 01:27:21,244
<i>Did you?
Then why didn't I?</i>

1143
01:27:21,347 --> 01:27:26,236
I love Flora, and I know what she feels
before she feels it herself.

1144
01:27:26,339 --> 01:27:30,333
She loved this house.

1145
01:27:30,436 --> 01:27:32,443
She was as happy here-

1146
01:27:32,548 --> 01:27:34,687
<i>As happy as I am. </i>

1147
01:27:34,788 --> 01:27:36,611
Are you?

1148
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:39,524
- What?
- So very happy.

1149
01:27:42,437 --> 01:27:44,347
Are you, Miles?

1150
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:49,150
If you'll excuse me.

1151
01:27:51,494 --> 01:27:53,349
Miles, you haven't-

1152
01:28:05,351 --> 01:28:09,410
Poor Flora. She must have been upset
to have forgotten Rupert.

1153
01:28:14,056 --> 01:28:17,123
Why did you want to
be alone with me?

1154
01:28:17,224 --> 01:28:19,264
I think you know very well.

1155
01:28:19,369 --> 01:28:21,191
What do I know?

1156
01:28:21,289 --> 01:28:25,446
<i>Or rather, what is it
that you want to know?</i>

1157
01:28:25,546 --> 01:28:29,801
Well, for one thing, why that night
when you were supposed to be in bed...

1158
01:28:29,897 --> 01:28:32,548
- why were you in the garden?
- I told you.

1159
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:36,131
The real reason, Miles.

1160
01:28:36,234 --> 01:28:39,682
It's beyond me why you go on asking
a fellow questions...

1161
01:28:39,787 --> 01:28:43,082
when every time he answers you
you tell him it isn't true.

1162
01:28:43,179 --> 01:28:45,481
Because you are not
telling the truth.

1163
01:28:45,579 --> 01:28:48,165
Don't shout.
Don't be so angry.

1164
01:28:48,268 --> 01:28:50,504
It does something to your face.

1165
01:28:50,604 --> 01:28:53,452
It makes you look ugly and cruel.

1166
01:28:53,548 --> 01:28:57,290
Miles. Miles, listen to me.

1167
01:28:57,388 --> 01:28:59,625
I'm not a cruel person.

1168
01:28:59,724 --> 01:29:02,343
I'm sometimes very foolish
and I make mistakes...

1169
01:29:02,445 --> 01:29:05,260
but I'm not cruel.

1170
01:29:05,357 --> 01:29:08,838
My father taught me
to love people and help them.

1171
01:29:08,942 --> 01:29:11,331
Help them even if
they refuse my help.

1172
01:29:11,437 --> 01:29:13,260
Even if it hurt them sometimes.

1173
01:29:13,358 --> 01:29:16,293
And that's the only reason
I'm here is to help you.

1174
01:29:16,398 --> 01:29:18,951
Whatever you've done,
I'm not against you.

1175
01:29:19,055 --> 01:29:22,154
- I don't think it's your fault.
- But I haven't done anything.

1176
01:29:22,254 --> 01:29:25,604
Then why were you
sent home from school?

1177
01:29:26,992 --> 01:29:31,215
It must be because I'm different.

1178
01:29:31,312 --> 01:29:35,819
<i>But you aren't. 
You're like any other boy. </i>

1179
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,506
Ah, now who isn't
telling the truth?

1180
01:29:38,609 --> 01:29:42,864
If you really thought that,
we wouldn't be having these conversations.

1181
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:46,256
No, my dear, you don't think
I'm like any other boy.

1182
01:29:46,353 --> 01:29:48,175
That's why you're afraid.

1183
01:29:49,362 --> 01:29:51,850
If I am, it's for you.

1184
01:29:51,954 --> 01:29:54,321
And I am afraid
for you, Miles.

1185
01:29:54,418 --> 01:29:56,785
- If you don't tell me now-
- There's nothing.

1186
01:29:56,882 --> 01:29:59,501
Isn't there?
Why did you take my letter?

1187
01:29:59,602 --> 01:30:02,919
You did take it, didn't you?

1188
01:30:03,026 --> 01:30:04,936
Yes, I took it.

1189
01:30:05,042 --> 01:30:07,312
Why?

1190
01:30:07,411 --> 01:30:09,965
To see what you said about us.

1191
01:30:10,067 --> 01:30:12,271
Us?

1192
01:30:12,371 --> 01:30:14,924
Well, about me.

1193
01:30:15,028 --> 01:30:17,614
And what did you discover?

1194
01:30:17,716 --> 01:30:20,586
You thanked my uncle
for trusting you.

1195
01:30:20,693 --> 01:30:22,700
You apologized for troubling him...

1196
01:30:22,805 --> 01:30:24,845
for asking him to come down.

1197
01:30:24,949 --> 01:30:26,989
Go on, Miles.
What else did I say?

1198
01:30:27,093 --> 01:30:31,698
That's all I read. I heard footsteps.
I threw it on the fire.

1199
01:30:31,797 --> 01:30:34,285
And did you take other things?

1200
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:36,529
Is that what you did at school?

1201
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:38,452
No, I'm not a thief.

1202
01:30:38,550 --> 01:30:40,917
Then what did you do, Miles?

1203
01:30:41,015 --> 01:30:45,488
I- Well, I- I said things.

1204
01:30:49,175 --> 01:30:50,997
Yes, Miles?

1205
01:30:53,655 --> 01:30:56,590
Sometimes I hurt things.

1206
01:30:57,848 --> 01:31:00,499
<i>And sometimes at night... </i>

1207
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,967
<i>when everything was dark-</i>

1208
01:31:04,409 --> 01:31:06,297
<i>- What?
- They screamed. </i>

1209
01:31:06,393 --> 01:31:09,011
The masters heard about it.

1210
01:31:10,361 --> 01:31:14,999
They said I frightened
the other boys.

1211
01:31:17,818 --> 01:31:19,640
And when...

1212
01:31:19,738 --> 01:31:23,797
did you first see
and hear of such things?

1213
01:31:23,899 --> 01:31:27,827
<i>Why, I- I made them up. </i>

1214
01:31:31,804 --> 01:31:33,876
Who taught them to you?

1215
01:31:33,979 --> 01:31:36,565
I told you,
they just came into my head.

1216
01:31:36,668 --> 01:31:38,806
What were they?

1217
01:31:38,908 --> 01:31:41,494
Shall I tell you
who taught them to you?

1218
01:31:41,597 --> 01:31:43,419
I won't ever again.
I promise.

1219
01:31:43,517 --> 01:31:45,906
Shall I tell you who taught you
the things you've done, the things you've said?

1220
01:31:46,012 --> 01:31:49,875
- Shall I tell you his name?
- You don't fool me.

1221
01:31:49,981 --> 01:31:51,737
<i>I know why you keep on and on. </i>

1222
01:31:51,837 --> 01:31:54,293
It's because you're afraid.
You're afraid you might be mad.

1223
01:31:54,397 --> 01:31:57,910
<i>So you keep on and on, trying to make me
admit something that isn't true. </i>

1224
01:31:58,014 --> 01:32:00,251
<i>Trying to frighten me
the way you frightened Flora. </i>

1225
01:32:00,351 --> 01:32:02,740
<i>- Miles.
- But I'm not Flora. I'm no baby. </i>

1226
01:32:02,846 --> 01:32:04,951
<i>You think you can
run to my uncle with a lot of lies. </i>

1227
01:32:05,054 --> 01:32:08,120
<i>But he won't believe you,
not when I tell him what you are-</i>

1228
01:32:08,223 --> 01:32:11,420
a damned hussy,
a damned dirty-minded hag!

1229
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:15,000
<i>You never fooled us. We always knew. </i>

1230
01:32:42,626 --> 01:32:45,594
- Miles?
- Forgive me.

1231
01:32:45,698 --> 01:32:49,015
Hush, darling, hush.

1232
01:32:49,122 --> 01:32:51,327
- There.
- I didn't mean it.

1233
01:32:51,427 --> 01:32:54,843
Oh, it wasn't you.

1234
01:32:54,947 --> 01:32:58,209
That voice, those words...

1235
01:32:58,308 --> 01:33:00,130
they weren't yours.

1236
01:33:00,228 --> 01:33:02,498
Forgive me.

1237
01:33:02,596 --> 01:33:04,353
Oh, Miles.

1238
01:33:04,452 --> 01:33:07,868
Dear Miles, say it now.

1239
01:33:07,972 --> 01:33:09,882
Now, while I'm holding you.

1240
01:33:09,988 --> 01:33:12,542
Say his name...

1241
01:33:12,645 --> 01:33:14,685
and it will all be over.

1242
01:33:14,789 --> 01:33:17,123
Who?

1243
01:33:18,181 --> 01:33:20,221
The man who taught you.

1244
01:33:20,326 --> 01:33:22,148
The man you've been meeting...

1245
01:33:22,246 --> 01:33:24,069
that you've never
stopped meeting.

1246
01:33:24,166 --> 01:33:26,622
You're wrong!
You're insane!

1247
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:31,037
- You're insane! You're insane!
- His name, Miles!

1248
01:33:31,143 --> 01:33:34,209
His name, Miles.
Tell me his name!

1249
01:33:34,311 --> 01:33:36,515
- You must tell me his name!
- He's dead!

1250
01:33:39,272 --> 01:33:41,661
Look! Miles, look!

1251
01:33:41,768 --> 01:33:43,591
<i>- Look!
- No!</i>

1252
01:33:43,689 --> 01:33:46,853
- He's here! For the last time, he's here!
- No, no, he's dead!

1253
01:33:46,953 --> 01:33:50,215
He's here,
and you must say his name!

1254
01:33:50,312 --> 01:33:54,404
Quint! Peter Quint!
Where? Where?

1255
01:33:54,505 --> 01:33:57,669
Where? Where, you devil?

1256
01:33:57,770 --> 01:33:59,592
Where?

1257
01:34:20,075 --> 01:34:23,272
He's gone, Miles.

1258
01:34:23,372 --> 01:34:25,194
You're safe.

1259
01:34:27,212 --> 01:34:29,122
You're free.

1260
01:34:31,469 --> 01:34:34,120
I have you.

1261
01:34:34,222 --> 01:34:36,589
He's lost you forever.

1262
01:34:40,334 --> 01:34:42,473
Miles?

1263
01:34:49,615 --> 01:34:51,437
Miles!

1264
01:34:51,535 --> 01:34:53,608
<i>Miles!</i>

1265
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,182
Oh!

1266
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,335
Oh, no.
