1
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:00,090
You passing, look and observe
how wretched you are.

2
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,492
That this land
imprisons us all the same.

3
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,996
Mortal, whoever you are,
stop and read.

4
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,432
Consider this: I am what you will be
and what you are, I have been.

5
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:24,013
Day and night you sing,
saying: Oh, Mama! Oh, papa!

6
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:28,077
While running through
hills and valleys.

7
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:32,284
Waychawcituy
of the Highlands...

8
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:36,055
...you who sings to nightfall.

9
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:43,262
Perhaps your mother has left
so you can be like me...

10
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:47,500
...for you to be singing.

11
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:54,605
When "Holy Time" comes around,
I will stop and I will go.

12
00:01:54,681 --> 00:02:01,280
Over the hills and valleys I will run
like you, I will sing like you.

13
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:09,085
Waychawcituy, Waychawcituy...

14
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:16,000
...when my beloved father cries
you will tell him not to...

15
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:22,804
...saying you will be back,
saying you will return.

16
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:27,040
Waychawcituy, Waychawcituy...

17
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:30,344
...when my beloved father cries
you will tell him not to...

18
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:36,685
...saying you will be back,
saying you will return.

19
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,680
Chale.

20
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,060
Tomorrow it's your turn.

21
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,122
One day each.

22
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,328
Then you can find
dead rats, too.

23
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:55,204
- Rats don't bring good luck.
- Yes they do.

24
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,072
I think I've
got lice again.

25
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,136
They do bring good luck.

26
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:05,014
I haven't
gotten lice yet.

27
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:08,247
That's because you wear
your hair loose.

28
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,748
Pick them, Made, please.

29
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,258
Okay, come here.

30
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,493
They itch terribly.

31
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,245
What happened to you?
You're all red.

32
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,841
From combing my hair,
but none burst.

33
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,022
- Listen.
- What?

34
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:50,551
You didn't tell me last year,
why she left them.

35
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,530
What?

36
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,156
You see?

37
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:59,296
When you spoke to me
of her other Holy Time.

38
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,839
The other Holy Time.

39
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,966
I don't know
what I told you.

40
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,476
Remember when you would
tell me about her?

41
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,709
I don't understand.

42
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:14,014
If she left, why did she
leave her earrings?

43
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,680
If she
liked them so much.

44
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,821
I don't know, or care.

45
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,918
If the old man hears me mention her,
he'll sew my mouth up.

46
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,360
Not even in
Holy Time, I think.

47
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,263
- Do I have them?
- Yes.

48
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,315
It burst,
it's not dry.

49
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,322
You'll wake your sister.

50
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,891
Come closer.

51
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:49,375
If you don't want to become the Virgin,
I'll ask Chale again.

52
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,677
I want to be the Virgin.

53
00:10:54,987 --> 00:11:01,324
You will be the prettiest
Virgin ever seen in our town.

54
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,197
I'm sleepy,
let me sleep.

55
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:10,897
Okay.

56
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,632
It's not Holy Time yet.

57
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:19,707
It will be very soon.

58
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,145
Not yet.

59
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,806
It would be a sin.

60
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,016
We've waited a long time.

61
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:33,081
I don't think a few hours
will bother Him.

62
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,800
Daddy...

63
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,858
He can see us.

64
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,200
It would be a sin.

65
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,275
- Not if you don't wake her.
- He can see us.

66
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,133
Chew on this,
you'll feel better.

67
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,610
Either I open the window
or I fall asleep...

68
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,622
...due to a lack of air.

69
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,964
I have a brother they
call the German, sir.

70
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,027
But he's not blonde.

71
00:13:56,101 --> 00:14:02,006
It's because, when he was
a kid of six or so...

72
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,974
...he fell in
an irrigation ditch.

73
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:07,012
And he almost died.

74
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,047
We pulled him out
half dead.

75
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,574
I think it was a miracle.

76
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:18,016
When he came to,
he couldn't speak.

77
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,059
His brain got wet.

78
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:24,653
It took many years to dry.

79
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,726
One day,
when we all thought...

80
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:33,329
...he wouldn't speak again...

81
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,339
...he started to talk...

82
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:39,468
...but with a German accent...

83
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,105
...the way the Germans talk...

84
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,808
...through the nose.

85
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,350
You know what I mean?

86
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:49,513
Now they call him the German,
and I'm the Mute.

87
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:53,046
I talk so much with
the people I transport that...

88
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:57,084
...when I get home,
I'm tired of talking.

89
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,824
I don't talk.

90
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,129
Doesn't your wife
say anything?

91
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:08,202
We're getting to the town
of Manayaycuna, sir.

92
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,504
There I'll have
to turn back.

93
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,476
I can go no further.

94
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,671
What do I do there?

95
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,011
You were going to take me
to Richcane.

96
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,674
That's what I paid for.

97
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,483
Only God knows, sir.

98
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,285
It is not my fault the river
flooded again.

99
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,816
That's bad luck.

100
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,954
Come back
to Lima with me.

101
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,727
I can't go back to Lima.

102
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,270
I'd take you, but it's the town's
festivities and they won't let me.

103
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:22,041
There's no road,
you must walk.

104
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,639
Well, that way I'll walk a bit.

105
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,450
Call this number.

106
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:34,891
Here is my name.
Tell them about the river.

107
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,691
I'm sorry but,
I can't read, sir.

108
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,426
You can't?
How do you drive?

109
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,865
Well, you know...

110
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,571
- Have someone read it to you.
- All right, sir.

111
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,734
I'll be back on Sunday.

112
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,643
In case they
don't pick you up.

113
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:58,046
I hope to be far away.

114
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,881
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

115
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,796
Hello.

116
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,433
Is anyone here?

117
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,535
Hello?

118
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:29,237
Made, close the door,
someone could see us.

119
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,707
Close it, quick!

120
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,454
Where were you?

121
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,049
You're late.

122
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,992
They're going to
give the prize.

123
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,893
I don't care.

124
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,229
Don't worry, calm down,
we are leaving.

125
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,534
- You're stepping on my dress!
- No, no.

126
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,877
I know it's for you.

127
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,247
No.

128
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:24,559
And now we introduce you...

129
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,532
...to the little Virgins of
these festivities.

130
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,830
Let us welcome the
most beautiful women.

131
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:36,273
Here is the most beautiful
of Manayaycuna.

132
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,405
Applause, please!

133
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,884
This is the moment we have all been
waiting for in Manayaycuna.

134
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:51,787
And here we have our
young little Virgins.

135
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,897
And the most
beautiful lmmaculate Virgin...

136
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:04,800
...the prettiest saint
this year is...

137
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:16,145
Madeinusa Machuca!

138
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,582
A round of applause, please.

139
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,055
Madeinusa Machuca...

140
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,284
...daughter of our
illustrious mayor.

141
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,520
Madeinusa!

142
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:34,294
A round of applause for
the patron of these festivities!

143
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,739
You'll get it next year.

144
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,736
- Where is that man?
- That's him.

145
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,076
Are you the mayor?

146
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:28,085
Cayo Machuca, mayor of this
town, at your service.

147
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,644
No one understands me.

148
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,087
I'm locked up
and don't know why.

149
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:35,649
My people don't like strangers
at their festivities.

150
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,025
- Try to understand.
- You don't get it.

151
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,860
I'm locked up, but didn't do anything.
It must be a mistake.

152
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,628
You're better off
staying here.

153
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:47,069
What? I can't stay here.
That's impossible.

154
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,573
Until after the festivities.

155
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:54,010
Sir, he came in
the Mute's delivery truck.

156
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,979
Yes, and I'm stuck here.

157
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,983
- You're from Lima.
- So?

158
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:02,179
Yes, and I work for
the Siemense Mine.

159
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,280
I'm Salvador Ariendi,
just call and ask.

160
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,621
There's no phone here.

161
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,526
They will come to
pick me up.

162
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,028
Don't upset me!

163
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:16,056
Sir, the roads are closed,
flooded.

164
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,193
No towns within
a three day walk.

165
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,601
Can he walk?

166
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:23,937
- Leave him locked up!
- Show some respect! Shut up!

167
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,477
Mister Mayor,
all his things are there.

168
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,706
No one's taken anything.

169
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,876
- Did anyone take anything?
- No, it's all there.

170
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:37,012
The things that
came from Lima are there.

171
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,784
- Is everything there?
- Yes.

172
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,883
Please go,
it's almost time.

173
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,928
Get to work.

174
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:49,762
- Do you know how to use that?
- Yes, it's mine.

175
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,268
Follow me.

176
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,798
Few times have
strangers come here.

177
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,862
It's a pleasure
to have you.

178
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,669
But my people
don't like it.

179
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,271
It's a bad time to come.

180
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,542
During festivities
is a bad time.

181
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:40,915
If they don't come today,
I can go with the Mute on Sunday.

182
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,887
This is very strange.

183
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,048
Hasn't anyone
ever come here?

184
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:51,087
It's strange for
anyone to die before the festivities.

185
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,098
That hadn't happened
in a long time.

186
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,396
Could you do
a little job for me?

187
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,311
- My sincere condolences.
- Thank you.

188
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,713
A little favor.

189
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,420
Take her alone, and then
with the whole family.

190
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,728
Don't make her look ugly.

191
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,357
Don't worry.

192
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:33,097
Can you move in?
You too, yes.

193
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,455
This is my home.
You'll stay here.

194
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,513
No one will
bother you here.

195
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,115
You understand?

196
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,820
I appreciate it.

197
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:01,127
As I said, there are no roads and no one
can walk alone.

198
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,633
I can take
care of myself.

199
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,636
You're not my guest...

200
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,571
...but I'll keep you here
for your own good.

201
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,327
I'm taking this
garbage out.

202
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,385
- Wait here.
- Okay.

203
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,704
Damn!

204
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,177
What a fuckin' shit town!

205
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,415
Be still.

206
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,818
Madeinusa this,
Madeinusa that.

207
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,914
I don't know why the old man
treats you like that.

208
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,761
Did you comb well?

209
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,731
The lice could come
out your veil.

210
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,893
I am not itching.

211
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:20,444
- Did you see his eyes?
- Why should I?

212
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:27,648
They are lighter,
like in the magazines.

213
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:31,655
And yours the color of your
shit, so don't get excited.

214
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,748
Cut the crap.

215
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:37,226
They'll dress you at
the mountain church at 1:00.

216
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:38,956
I know.

217
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,666
Wash well there.

218
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,104
I know.

219
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:52,405
I have to go to
town with the pot.

220
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:56,243
Use more poison, maybe
you'll be luckier.

221
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:03,443
Why? Why did you
burn my things?

222
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,380
I didn't do anything.

223
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,715
It's all burnt.

224
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:11,551
What things do you mean?

225
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,090
Where is the pot?

226
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,490
Don't lie to me.

227
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,755
I'm sure it was you.

228
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,389
Don't pester me.
I didn't do it.

229
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:24,829
I did it.

230
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:40,537
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to.

231
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,039
I swear to God.

232
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,041
I don't know
who brought me here.

233
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,407
You're Cayo's daughter,
aren't you?

234
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,180
What is that?

235
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,049
Do you have the key?

236
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,160
It's a recorder.
I use it for work.

237
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,503
It's a recorder.
I use it for work.

238
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:18,133
This way I
remember everything.

239
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,201
This way
I remember everything.

240
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,313
How old are you?

241
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,850
Madeinusa, right?

242
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,151
- Are you from Lima?
- Yes, that's right.

243
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,788
- I have to go.
- Wait.

244
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:45,335
Look.

245
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,768
Take it.

246
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:56,403
- How did you behave with him?
- Very well, Aunt.

247
00:32:56,474 --> 00:33:01,571
You will be wonderful as a Virgin and
not as any other young lady.

248
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,104
- What does your father say?
- Nothing.

249
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:08,949
- And your sister?
- She loves me a lot.

250
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,681
It's Holy Time.

251
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,017
Time is holy.

252
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,250
Now it is Holy Time.

253
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,917
Holy Time, Holy Time...

254
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,926
Now it is Holy Time...

255
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:23,604
Holy Time,
it's Holy Time!

256
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:31,704
Holy Time,
it's Holy Time...

257
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,590
Ladies and gentlemen...

258
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:33,364
I am honored to introduce our
illustrious mayor...

259
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:37,931
...and ask him to open the
festivities of this Holy Time...

260
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,841
And up with the pots!

261
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:44,333
You look very pretty.

262
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:23,296
This is a strange town.

263
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,336
You come from Lima?

264
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,746
That's right.
Didn't I tell you?

265
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:40,389
Had I known this,
I would have stayed there.

266
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,660
Though I don't know
which is better.

267
00:42:54,772 --> 00:43:00,733
Madeinusa, little town Virgin,
work a miracle for me.

268
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:03,541
Did your brain dry up, too?

269
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,495
If you want to go,
I can guide you.

270
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:21,030
Really?

271
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,331
And those earrings?

272
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:35,037
They were my mommy's.

273
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:38,878
She lives in Lima,
like you.

274
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:48,788
Why do you
look at me like that?

275
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:52,920
You don't know
where I'm from...

276
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:56,956
Why do you look
at me like that?

277
00:43:57,034 --> 00:44:00,561
You don't
know where I'm from...

278
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:07,339
I'm a country girl,
Manayaycuna at heart...

279
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:10,778
I'm a country girl...

280
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:14,284
Manayaycuna at heart.

281
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:18,048
When I sing to you...

282
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:21,649
...look at me, at yourself,
see how you are...

283
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:28,255
...lost in the horizon,
lost in your stare.

284
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:31,460
Lost in the horizon...

285
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:34,698
Iost in your stare.

286
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:41,041
Please tell me why you look
at me like that.

287
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:45,775
With this song...

288
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,649
I will
steal your heart away.

289
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,884
With this song...

290
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:57,188
I will take your
heart away.

291
00:44:57,261 --> 00:45:00,788
I will
steal your heart away.

292
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:04,163
I will take your
heart away.

293
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:11,163
I will steal your heart away,
I will take your heart away.

294
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:20,044
Wake up, it's time.

295
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:21,709
Change.

296
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:14,928
Cheers, cheers!

297
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:19,769
What a
beautiful woman!

298
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:23,108
- Give her more to drink!
- Drink, drink!

299
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,695
How disgusting!

300
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,303
Thanks for the food.

301
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,348
You brought it,
didn't you?

302
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,246
He can't see us.

303
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,920
It's Holy Time.

304
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:46,649
He can't see us.

305
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:48,816
Who?

306
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:52,328
God, He's dead.

307
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,121
He can't see us.

308
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:58,292
He's dead...
He's dead until Sunday.

309
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:02,638
I'm sorry,
I don't understand you.

310
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,782
There are no sins
in Holy Time.

311
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:16,284
Didn't you know?

312
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:19,720
They think God is dead
and there are no sins?

313
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:20,984
Really.

314
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:54,119
What are you doing?

315
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,258
You don't have
to do that.

316
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,500
My name is on your shirt.

317
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,206
Your name?

318
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,469
I saw it.

319
00:51:57,514 --> 00:51:59,573
Do you know
what it means?

320
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:03,378
"Made in U.S.A."

321
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,387
That's not a name.

322
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,252
It's mine.

323
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:09,258
I like it.

324
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:10,918
It's not a name.

325
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:14,896
You should be Rosa or
Maria, not Madeinusa.

326
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:23,502
It's my name.

327
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:55,196
Will you take me
to Lima?

328
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:59,106
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have.

329
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,741
Shit!

330
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:05,974
Forgive me, really.

331
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:08,916
I'm going to
Lima with you.

332
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:11,385
Who said
I want to go?

333
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:12,853
You must take me.

334
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:16,290
You can't leave like this,
and much less with me.

335
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:19,553
Besides, the Mute won't
be here until Sunday.

336
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:22,757
Not Sunday.
Now or tomorrow.

337
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,959
Madeinusa.

338
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,230
Madeinusa, look at me.

339
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,208
I can't take you to Lima.

340
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:35,540
It can't be on Sunday.

341
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:38,775
Now or tomorrow.
Not Sunday.

342
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:40,372
Listen.

343
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,008
I said I'm sorry.

344
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:43,450
What do you want now?

345
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,354
For me to take you
for screwing you?

346
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:53,253
- Lima would destroy you.
- I don't care.

347
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:56,788
You don't care about your dad,
your sister?

348
00:53:56,866 --> 00:54:00,097
Sunday we can't,
it would be a sin.

349
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,297
- Really.
- You'd better go.

350
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,402
Go.

351
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,407
Get out.

352
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:28,863
What have
you done, child?

353
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:32,333
What have you
done, child?

354
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:35,565
What will your father say?

355
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:39,006
He's been waiting
for so long.

356
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:15,777
You've been waiting so long
and she's already been used.

357
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:32,388
- Where were you?
- In town.

358
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:33,895
- With who?
- No one.

359
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:36,864
- How obedient.
- Shut your mouth!

360
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:38,127
You only yell at me!

361
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,965
She plays dumb and
you defend her!

362
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:43,130
Yell at her for stealing
those earrings!

363
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:45,538
I said shut up!

364
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:47,872
You're just
like your mother!

365
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:57,618
Daddy, please,
don't break them.

366
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:00,722
A little Virgin that cries.

367
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,315
Leave me alone!

368
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:04,417
Shut up, both!

369
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:07,986
You should be happy,
it's Holy Time!

370
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:11,328
Go to bed.

371
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:16,299
Daddy, please,
don't break them.

372
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,807
Lie down, child.

373
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,754
Do you mind?

374
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:28,028
How could you mind?

375
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:51,750
Why do you comb
your hair so much?

376
00:59:51,821 --> 00:59:53,311
Don't look at me.

377
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:01,226
I'm glad he took
that woman's earrings.

378
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:05,358
- It's your fault.
- There is no fault.

379
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,366
Shut up.
You're bad.

380
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,871
Don't play dumb.

381
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:12,533
As the midwife said...

382
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:16,705
God doesn't see,
but the old man does.

383
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:20,906
I'm not playing dumb.

384
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:22,815
And it's Holy Time.

385
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:42,467
He wants me to sew
your knickers to your dress.

386
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:44,438
- Liar!
- He forced me to.

387
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:45,496
Liar!

388
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:52,613
I'll just sew your dress.

389
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:54,980
That's easy.

390
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:57,781
I'll say I sewed it.

391
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:59,219
Besides,
what do you care?

392
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:01,779
It's worse if he thinks
you didn't do it.

393
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:04,850
- Why are you nagging me?
- I'm not.

394
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:08,328
Sew then, I don't care.

395
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:27,073
I won't sew it tight so
it won't bother you.

396
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:32,087
If I don't tighten it,
I won't ruin the dress.

397
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:34,282
I don't care
about the dress.

398
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:38,325
I'll go to Lima and buy
lots of them.

399
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:43,790
To Lima?

400
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,663
Yes.

401
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:52,597
Don't say that again
or the old man will kick you to death.

402
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:00,215
You believe
everything you hear.

403
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:01,773
I believe nothing!

404
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:04,513
I'll go to Lima,
like my mommy.

405
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:06,316
Shut up.
Don't speak of her.

406
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:07,981
I won't shut up!

407
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,664
I'll go to Lima,
and you won't.

408
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:22,763
Do not take, sir.
Do not steal.

409
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:24,925
Shut up, lady.
Don't cry.

410
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:31,062
Do not take.
I beg of you.

411
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,108
Shut up, Margarita.

412
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:35,974
Besides, you won't
see it next year.

413
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:42,608
Let's go.

414
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:47,679
We haven't come in years so,
don't cry or we will take more things.

415
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:31,458
Young Salvador,
are you all right?

416
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:35,626
I was told you
had died...

417
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,969
...but I said you hadn't.

418
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:45,580
How did you get out?

419
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:49,580
I'm fine.
Let go.

420
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:24,080
Please have a seat.

421
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:33,374
Bring them in!

422
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:46,792
- What now?
- These are our women.

423
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:49,854
They choose who to go to bed with
the night of Holy Time.

424
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:51,160
Not the gringo!

425
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:48,281
Madeinusa isn't here.

426
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:50,018
I'm not
looking for her.

427
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:51,821
- Who, then?
- You.

428
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:00,697
- What is that?
- Rat poison.

429
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:03,431
Want some?
Brings good luck.

430
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:05,770
No, thanks.

431
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:09,266
You shouldn't be here.

432
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:11,609
Are you afraid
to be alone?

433
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:20,686
Not even God knows where
she is now.

434
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:22,849
But not for long.

435
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:25,826
Tomorrow at 6:00 A.M. He wakes up
to take care of her.

436
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:30,355
To pray and work little
miracles.

437
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:35,900
I never ask for anything.

438
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:37,529
What for?

439
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:51,617
Once I saw pretty red
shoes in a magazine.

440
01:09:52,988 --> 01:09:57,288
In a magazine from Lima.

441
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:01,995
Pretty clothes,
make-up and all that.

442
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,291
There was a number to
call and buy.

443
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:13,174
I walked two, three days
to the next town to call.

444
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:16,439
But they said they don't
deliver here.

445
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:19,881
"Lmpossible," they said.

446
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:23,844
Now I ask for nothing.

447
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:25,147
What for?

448
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,554
I'll send you
those red shoes.

449
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:30,319
Liar.

450
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,257
You'll believe me then.

451
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:37,397
That's so I won't tell you
did filthy things with my sister.

452
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:39,229
I realize that.

453
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:58,247
My father was
weak letting you stay.

454
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,983
The town doesn't want a gringo
in Holy Time.

455
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:04,989
You'd better go.

456
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:14,429
If a hailstorm surprises us...

457
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:18,030
...if a rainstorm
surprises us...

458
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:23,340
...your mantilla you
should bring.

459
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:26,575
Tell not your mother...

460
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:29,379
...tell not your father
that we are going...

461
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:36,118
...to far-off lands
for no one to see us.

462
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:39,456
Let's go.

463
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:42,622
If a
rainstorm surprises us...

464
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:45,633
...if a hailstorm
surprises us...

465
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:51,537
...your mantilla you
should bring.

466
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:54,940
Tell not your mother...

467
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:58,036
...tell not your father
that we are going...

468
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:04,109
...to far-off lands
for no one to notice.

469
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:07,485
Let's go.

470
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:10,753
If a
hailstorm surprises us...

471
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:13,761
...if a rainstorm
surprises us...

472
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:19,631
...your mantilla
you should bring.

473
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:23,138
Let's go,
brave young lady.

474
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:26,265
Let's go, brave one.

475
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:29,140
Should your mother
find me...

476
01:12:29,211 --> 01:12:32,009
...maiden, I will say he
already is my son-in-law.

477
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:09,807
Madeinusa?

478
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:16,320
Madeinusa,
I know you're in there.

479
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:26,000
What's going on? You don't want to
see me anymore?

480
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:33,537
Do you still want to
go to Lima?

481
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:41,042
I'll take you,
if you want.

482
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,419
He'll see you now.

483
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:56,054
I'm coming.

484
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:57,257
Thank you.

485
01:13:57,332 --> 01:14:01,666
I heard what you said,
but didn't tell Daddy.

486
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:04,331
Really, I didn't
tell him anything.

487
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:21,922
Have a seat,
young man.

488
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:43,638
- Is that good?
- It's good.

489
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:53,154
- Are you leaving tomorrow?
- Yes, tomorrow.

490
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:09,803
Come with me.

491
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:18,774
I'll show
you something.

492
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:41,931
I keep the little
Virgins' gifts here.

493
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:46,774
All the town gifts
are here.

494
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:54,280
It's best they think
she takes them up there.

495
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:58,146
If not, people would
be mad at me.

496
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:05,159
I help her,
and she helps me.

497
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:20,338
Pick out a gift from me,
from the town, for you.

498
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:25,179
Anything, anything.

499
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:27,044
That's not necessary.

500
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,448
Then don't snub me.

501
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:39,056
If you don't,
I'll get mad at you.

502
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:46,100
Pick out anything
in this room.

503
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:48,398
But just one thing.

504
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:50,199
I said no.

505
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:59,241
Then I'll pick it
out for you.

506
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:15,855
Here.

507
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:18,161
- Take it.
- No!

508
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:29,035
You see?
You broke the gift.

509
01:17:29,111 --> 01:17:32,171
It's quite clear...

510
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:36,183
...that you will leave
here empty-handed.

511
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:39,414
You will take nothing.

512
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,854
Nothing.

513
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:32,337
Who's there?

514
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:37,739
Chale, is that you?

515
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:41,648
I know it's you.

516
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:45,710
Open the door,
don't be bad.

517
01:18:45,787 --> 01:18:46,879
Open it!

518
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:49,617
I can't,
I don't have the key.

519
01:18:49,691 --> 01:18:52,182
Find it, please.

520
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:55,957
- He took it with him.
- Chale, please!

521
01:18:56,998 --> 01:19:00,331
Made, you'd
better stay there.

522
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:02,734
This is almost over,
really.

523
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:05,170
Chale, no!
Open!

524
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:08,403
Please don't go.
Open it!

525
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:10,809
Don't go!
Open it!

526
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:40,484
The Mute's truck gets
here early.

527
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:44,525
I'll take you,
what the hell!

528
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:50,000
Let's go.

529
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:25,105
My earrings!

530
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:27,334
I have to go
get the earrings.

531
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:29,343
I must go back.

532
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:31,436
I can't leave without
my earrings.

533
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:35,313
- What do they matter?
- Stay here.

534
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:37,283
You can't come.
Wait here.

535
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:39,877
What's with
the damn earrings?

536
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,513
Wait for me.

537
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:44,524
- Shit, Madeinusa!
- Wait for me!

538
01:22:46,161 --> 01:22:47,719
Shit!

539
01:26:04,259 --> 01:26:08,218
Waychawcituy
of the Highlands...

540
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:12,198
...you who sings so sadly.

541
01:26:12,267 --> 01:26:16,636
Perhaps your mother
has left...

542
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:20,401
...so you can be like me.

543
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:24,571
So you can be
like me.

544
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:33,312
When "Holy Time"
comes around...

545
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:37,154
I will go over hills
and valleys...

546
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:40,956
I will get away,
like you.

547
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:44,123
I will go away, like you.

548
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:48,135
I will go away,
like you.

549
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:11,414
Dad.

550
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:15,656
Daddy, your chicken broth.

551
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:51,357
Holy Time, Holy Time...

552
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:54,731
Holy Time...
Holy Time is over.

553
01:27:54,802 --> 01:27:57,635
Dad.

554
01:27:57,705 --> 01:28:00,333
Daddy, here.

555
01:28:02,043 --> 01:28:03,305
Drink this.

556
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:13,914
When I think of
my loved one...

557
01:28:13,988 --> 01:28:18,118
I say: Who
is she loving now?

558
01:28:18,192 --> 01:28:23,357
She must spend the
nights with someone.

559
01:28:23,431 --> 01:28:28,027
When I think of
my loved one...

560
01:28:44,252 --> 01:28:48,484
I say: Who is
she loving now?

561
01:28:48,556 --> 01:28:53,892
She must spend the
nights with someone.

562
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:58,864
She must spend
the days with someone.

563
01:29:04,439 --> 01:29:07,101
Who is she loving now?

564
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:09,302
Who is she
loving now?

565
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,218
He broke my earrings.

566
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:58,553
He broke them.

567
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:02,362
You're crazy...
You're crazy.

568
01:30:20,715 --> 01:30:23,684
They were my earrings.

569
01:30:47,542 --> 01:30:49,669
Chale.

570
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:53,770
Dad?

571
01:30:59,921 --> 01:31:01,684
Dad.

572
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:07,594
Dad.

573
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:09,527
Daddy.

574
01:31:11,766 --> 01:31:13,757
You killed my dad.

575
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:19,836
You've killed my dad!

576
01:31:19,907 --> 01:31:22,398
The gringo killed my dad!

577
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:26,413
Come, everyone!
The gringo killed my dad!

578
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:28,142
Come!

579
01:31:28,216 --> 01:31:30,878
The gringo killed
my dad!

580
01:31:30,952 --> 01:31:34,217
The gringo
killed my dad!

581
01:31:34,288 --> 01:31:38,782
Come! The gringo
killed my dad!

582
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:42,660
Come!
The gringo killed my dad!

583
01:31:53,975 --> 01:31:56,876
The gringo
killed my dad!

584
01:34:12,747 --> 01:34:15,238
What's your name?

585
01:34:21,022 --> 01:34:22,990
Madeinusa.

586
01:34:26,127 --> 01:34:27,492
Where are you going?

587
01:34:33,467 --> 01:34:35,128
To Lima.

588
01:34:35,202 --> 01:34:39,832
I have a brother they
call the German, miss.

589
01:34:39,907 --> 01:34:41,670
But he's not blonde.

590
01:34:41,742 --> 01:34:46,645
It's because, when he
was a kid of six or so...

591
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:49,877
...he fell in
an irrigation ditch.

592
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:51,850
And he almost died.

593
01:34:51,919 --> 01:34:54,217
We pulled him
out half dead.

594
01:34:54,288 --> 01:34:56,620
I think it
was a miracle...
