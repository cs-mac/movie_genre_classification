1
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,015
Silence. Be upstanding in court.

2
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,724
All persons who have
anything to do before my lords,

3
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:24,930
the queen's justices of oyer and terminer
and general jail delivery

4
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:28,401
for the jurisdiction
of the Central Criminal Court

5
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,155
draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.

6
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:06,537
What a beautiful day. I've been hoping
for a bit of sun for our homecoming.

7
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:12,790
It's worth having the fog just to appreciate
the sunshine. Is there a draught?

8
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:17,884
- Shall I roll up the window?
- Roll up your mouth. You talk too much.

9
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:21,549
If I'd known how much you talked
I'd never have come out of my coma.

10
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:23,973
- This thing weighs a ton.
- Now, now.

11
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:29,774
We've been flat on our back
for two months, we'd better be careful.

12
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:45,077
Lovely, lovely. It must be perfectly lovely
to live and work in the Inns of Court.

13
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,746
How lucky you lawyers are.

14
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:52,455
I almost married a lawyer.
I was in attendance for his appendectomy

15
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,295
and we became engaged
as soon as he could sit up.

16
00:02:55,427 --> 00:02:58,463
And then peritonitis set in
and he went like that.

17
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,681
He certainly was a lucky lawyer.

18
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,437
Teeny-weeny steps, now. Remember
we had a teeny-weeny heart attack.

19
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:19,697
Oh, shut up!

20
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:21,866
Williams, my cane.

21
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:30,166
Here he comes!

22
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:45,434
Good afternoon. Thank you very much.
Everybody back to work.

23
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,724
Sir Wilfrid, if you don't mind, I'd like
to read you a poem to welcome you back.

24
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:54,020
Very touching. You can recite it
after office hours in your own time.

25
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:56,608
Now back to work.
What's the matter with you?

26
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:59,905
Nothing. I'm just happy
that you're your old self again.

27
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:04,245
Any more sentimentality around here,
I shall go back to the hospital!

28
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:07,954
They won't take him back.
He wasn't really discharged, you know,

29
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:11,452
he was expelled for conduct
unbecoming a cardiac patient.

30
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:16,213
Put these in water, blabbermouth!
Come on in, Carter.

31
00:04:21,597 --> 00:04:26,093
Look at this room.
It's ugly, old and musty.

32
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:30,141
But I never knew
I could miss anything so much.

33
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:33,558
- Missed you too, you musty old buzzard.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

34
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:38,235
I'm not a religious man, but when they
carted you off, I went out and lit a candle.

35
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:42,147
- Why, thank you, Carter.
- Actually, sir, I was lighting it for myself.

36
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:46,116
If anything happened to you,
what would happen to me, after 37 years?

37
00:04:46,246 --> 00:04:49,331
37 years! Has it been all that long?

38
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:54,453
Yes, sir. This is 1952, that was in October
1915. The Shepherd's Bush murder.

39
00:04:54,588 --> 00:04:59,499
The chemist accused of putting
cyanide in his uncle's toothpaste.

40
00:04:59,635 --> 00:05:04,629
My first murder trial.
I was more frightened than the defendant.

41
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:09,593
First time I rose to make an objection,
my wig fell off. Where's my wig?

42
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:11,768
Right here.

43
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:16,849
- I've guarded it with me life.
- I hope it still fits.

44
00:05:16,986 --> 00:05:19,856
I lost 30lbs in that wretched hospital.

45
00:05:19,989 --> 00:05:23,689
Still, I suppose my head isn't any smaller.

46
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:30,824
What's all this?

47
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:35,537
- We've put it in mothballs.
- Mothballs? Am I not to practise again?

48
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:39,122
Of course. The solicitors
have been breaking down our doors.

49
00:05:39,258 --> 00:05:43,007
- I've got some interesting briefs for you.
- That's better.

50
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:47,763
Divorce case, a tax appeal,
and an important marine insurance claim.

51
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:51,225
- Nice smooth matters with excellent fees.
- No, Carter.

52
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:55,683
I'm sorry, but you're not to undertake
any criminal cases. Your doctors have...

53
00:05:55,816 --> 00:06:00,359
Doctors! They've deprived me of alcohol,
tobacco, female companionship.

54
00:06:00,488 --> 00:06:03,109
If only they'd let me do
something worthwhile!

55
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,272
Sorry, sir.

56
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:08,073
Might as well get a bigger box,
more mothballs, put me away too.

57
00:06:08,204 --> 00:06:11,988
- 2.30, Sir Wilfrid. Time for our little nap!
- Oh, get out!

58
00:06:12,124 --> 00:06:16,418
Beddy-bye. We'd better go upstairs now,
get undressed and lie down.

59
00:06:16,546 --> 00:06:20,294
- We? What a nauseating prospect.
- Upstairs, please.

60
00:06:20,424 --> 00:06:22,962
Are you aware that, while on my sickbed,

61
00:06:23,094 --> 00:06:28,515
I seriously considered strangling you
with one of your own rubber tubes.

62
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:34,596
I would then have admitted the crime,
retained myself for the defence.

63
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:40,899
My lord, members of the jury, I hereby
enter a plea of justifiable homicide.

64
00:06:41,028 --> 00:06:46,070
For four months this alleged
angel of mercy has pored, probed,

65
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,328
punctured, pillaged and plundered
my helpless body

66
00:06:50,455 --> 00:06:54,583
while tormenting my mind
with a steady drip of baby talk.

67
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:57,378
Come along now, like a good boy. Oh, no.

68
00:06:57,503 --> 00:07:00,291
Take your hands off me,
or I'll strike you with my cane.

69
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:03,839
- You wouldn't, it might break your cigars.
- What cigars?

70
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:07,384
- The ones you're smuggling in your cane.
- Cane?

71
00:07:14,395 --> 00:07:17,599
You could be jailed for this.
You had no search warrant.

72
00:07:17,732 --> 00:07:21,018
In hospital he'd hide cigars and brandy
all over the place.

73
00:07:21,152 --> 00:07:23,939
We called him Wilfrid the fox.

74
00:07:24,072 --> 00:07:28,283
- I'm confiscating these.
- Can't I have just one?

75
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:30,782
No. Upstairs.

76
00:07:31,913 --> 00:07:34,784
A few puffs after meals? Please.

77
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:40,206
I'll do it. Some dark night when her back
is turned, I'll snatch her thermometer

78
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:44,253
and plunge it between
her shoulder blades. So help me, I will.

79
00:07:44,384 --> 00:07:50,837
Oh, no, sir. You mustn't walk up. We've
installed something for you here. It's a lift.

80
00:07:50,974 --> 00:07:54,841
A lift? I'm sick of this plot
to make me a helpless invalid.

81
00:07:54,978 --> 00:07:59,058
I think it's a splendid idea.
Let's try it, shall we?

82
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,983
Out of there. I'll try it.
It's my lift because it was my heart attack.

83
00:08:04,112 --> 00:08:07,944
Here you are. Simply press this button
for up and this one for down.

84
00:08:08,074 --> 00:08:11,159
Carter, I warn you,
if this contraption should collapse,

85
00:08:11,286 --> 00:08:15,580
if the barrister
should fall off the bannister...

86
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:25,675
Remarkable.
Smoothest flight I've had in years.

87
00:08:25,801 --> 00:08:30,712
- Upsy-daisy!
- Once more to get the feel of the controls.

88
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:47,406
Good afternoon.
Is it possible to see Sir Wilfrid?

89
00:08:47,531 --> 00:08:50,318
I didn't make an appointment,
but this is urgent.

90
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,196
If it's about a brief, I'm sorry, but we're
full. Sir Wilfrid has all that he can handle.

91
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,489
I'm sure he'll want this brief.

92
00:08:57,624 --> 00:09:00,198
Serious criminal matter.

93
00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:05,671
Absolutely not, Mr Mayhew.
Sir Wilfrid is still convalescent.

94
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:08,883
He can't accept anything
of an overstimulating nature.

95
00:09:09,011 --> 00:09:12,214
Put me on a diet of bland civil suits.
Hello, Mayhew.

96
00:09:12,347 --> 00:09:14,921
Hello. Distressing news about your health.

97
00:09:15,058 --> 00:09:18,724
It's tragic. You'd better get
a man with younger arteries.

98
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:22,721
If you could just give us a few minutes.
This is Mr Leonard Vole.

99
00:09:22,858 --> 00:09:28,314
- He's in rather a ghastly mess, I'm afraid.
- How do you do, Mr Vole?

100
00:09:28,447 --> 00:09:31,531
Well, according to Mr Mayhew,
I'm not doing at all well.

101
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:34,363
Sir Wilfrid! Sir Wilfrid!

102
00:09:34,495 --> 00:09:37,698
- You're dawdling again!
- Oh, shut up!

103
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:41,995
Sorry, Mayhew. Try me again when
you've something not too stimulating.

104
00:09:42,127 --> 00:09:45,212
Like a postman bitten by a stray dog.

105
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:56,427
I wish you could help us, Wilfrid, but
I quite understand. Take care of yourself.

106
00:09:57,518 --> 00:10:00,721
Mayhew! Mayhew!

107
00:10:00,855 --> 00:10:03,606
Oh, no. Sir Wilfrid, please.

108
00:10:03,732 --> 00:10:07,267
Don't worry, we won't take the brief,
but an old friend needs help.

109
00:10:07,403 --> 00:10:10,238
Surely I can give him a word of advice.

110
00:10:10,364 --> 00:10:14,314
Come on, I'll give you five minutes.
No, no, I don't want you, just Mayhew.

111
00:10:14,452 --> 00:10:17,156
Our nap! Sir Wilfrid! Our nap!

112
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:19,993
You go ahead. Start it without me.

113
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,959
This is your fault.
You should not have permitted it.

114
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:27,835
It is not my fault. I distinctly told
Sir Wilfrid no criminal cases.

115
00:10:27,965 --> 00:10:30,421
Well, if it's anyone's fault,
I expect it's mine.

116
00:10:30,551 --> 00:10:33,754
Seems silly to me,
but Mr Mayhew thinks it's very urgent.

117
00:10:33,888 --> 00:10:37,838
- He thinks I may be arrested any minute.
- Arrested for what?

118
00:10:37,975 --> 00:10:40,098
Well, for murder.

119
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:41,770
Oh!

120
00:10:41,896 --> 00:10:45,644
It's the case of Emily French.
You've probably seen reports in the press.

121
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:49,607
Middle-aged widow, well-off,
living with a housekeeper at Hampstead.

122
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:51,860
Mr Vole had been with her earlier.

123
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:54,907
When the housekeeper returned,
she found her dead,

124
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:57,323
struck on the back of the head
and killed.

125
00:10:57,453 --> 00:11:00,620
Vole seems caught
in a web of circumstantial evidence.

126
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:04,616
Perhaps if I gave you the details you'd
suggest the strongest line of defence.

127
00:11:04,752 --> 00:11:08,335
- I'd probably think better with a cigar.
- Of course.

128
00:11:08,464 --> 00:11:12,544
No previous convictions. He's of good
character with an excellent war record.

129
00:11:12,677 --> 00:11:16,971
- You'd like him a lot.
- They've confiscated the matches. A light.

130
00:11:17,098 --> 00:11:21,309
The defence may turn on establishing
an alibi for the night of the murder.

131
00:11:21,436 --> 00:11:26,181
- I haven't got any. Let me get you some.
- Lord, no! You don't know Miss Plimsoll.

132
00:11:26,315 --> 00:11:28,985
This will take all our cunning.

133
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:35,739
Young man!

134
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:37,741
Come here, please.

135
00:11:37,869 --> 00:11:42,163
Your solicitor and I feel you may be able
to enlighten me on an important point.

136
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,413
- Yes. Thank you.
- Sir Wilfrid!

137
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:47,627
You're not in bed yet? Upstairs!

138
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:53,379
- Give me a match.
- Sorry, I never carry them.

139
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,464
- What? You said I'd like him.
- But I do have a lighter.

140
00:11:56,596 --> 00:12:00,012
You're quite right, Mayhew,
I do like him. Thank you.

141
00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:04,637
Can you imagine Miss Plimsoll's face
if she saw me now?

142
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:09,100
Then let's make absolutely sure
that she doesn't.

143
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:13,278
Splendid. All the instincts
of a skilled criminal.

144
00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:16,275
- Thank you, sir.
- Here.

145
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:23,236
Whether or not you murdered
a middle-aged widow,

146
00:12:23,373 --> 00:12:27,157
you certainly saved the life
of an elderly barrister.

147
00:12:27,294 --> 00:12:29,535
I haven't murdered anybody. It's absurd.

148
00:12:29,671 --> 00:12:33,799
Christine, that's my wife, she thought
I may be implicated and needed a lawyer.

149
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:37,175
That's why I went to see Mr Mayhew.
Now he thinks he needs a lawyer

150
00:12:37,304 --> 00:12:39,877
and now I have two lawyers.
It's rather silly.

151
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:42,256
I am a solicitor. Sir Wilfrid is a barrister.

152
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:45,512
Only a barrister can actually
plead a case in court.

153
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:49,725
- Oh, I see.
- She shall not even find the ashes.

154
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:55,653
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

155
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,778
I saw in the paper that Mrs French had
been found dead with her head bashed in.

156
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,821
It also said the police were anxious to
interview me since I visited that evening.

157
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:08,871
- Naturally, I went to the police station.
- Did they caution you?

158
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:12,620
I don't quite know.
They asked if I'd like to make a statement

159
00:13:12,756 --> 00:13:17,169
and said they'd write it down and it might
be used against me. Is that a caution?

160
00:13:17,302 --> 00:13:19,461
Well, it can't be helped now.

161
00:13:19,596 --> 00:13:24,009
- They seemed quite satisfied.
- They seemed satisfied, Mr Vole.

162
00:13:24,142 --> 00:13:27,974
He thinks that he made a statement
and that's the end of it. Isn't it obvious

163
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:32,980
that you will be regarded as the principal
suspect? I'm afraid you'll be arrested.

164
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,435
I've done nothing!
Why should I be arrested?

165
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:39,818
This is England! You don't get arrested
or convicted for crimes you haven't done.

166
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,571
We try not to make a habit of it.

167
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:46,282
But it does happen, though, doesn't it?

168
00:13:46,415 --> 00:13:51,041
Of course. There was that case of
that fellow, whatshisname, Adolph Beck.

169
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,455
In jail for years and they
suddenly found it was another chap.

170
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:58,208
- He'd been innocent!
- Unfortunate, but restitution was made.

171
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:02,637
He received a pardon, a bounty from the
crown, and was restored to normal life.

172
00:14:02,765 --> 00:14:06,549
That's all right for him. What if
it had been murder? What if he'd hanged?

173
00:14:06,685 --> 00:14:09,888
How would they have restored him
to his normal life then?

174
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:14,399
Mr Vole, you must not take
such a morbid point of view.

175
00:14:14,526 --> 00:14:18,571
It's just when you say these things
are closing in on me, it's like a nightmare.

176
00:14:18,697 --> 00:14:23,406
Relax. You're in the hands of the finest,
most experienced barrister in London.

177
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:27,118
Let's get this straight. I may have done
something highly unethical.

178
00:14:27,248 --> 00:14:30,866
I've taken your cigar
but I'm not taking your case. I can't.

179
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:36,126
I'm forbidden. My doctors would never
allow it. I'm truly sorry, young man.

180
00:14:36,257 --> 00:14:39,174
But if you'd like the case
handled by these chambers,

181
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:43,133
- I'd recommend Mr Brogan-Moore.
- Yes. A very able man.

182
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:48,850
- I second Sir Wilfrid's recommendation.
- All right, sir, if you say so.

183
00:14:52,064 --> 00:14:54,104
Hold this.

184
00:14:57,403 --> 00:14:58,601
Carter?

185
00:14:58,738 --> 00:15:02,652
I would like to see Brogan-Moore here
as soon as he comes in from court.

186
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:05,701
Sir Wilfrid, I have never
known such insubordination.

187
00:15:05,828 --> 00:15:08,153
Not even as a nurse during the war.

188
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:12,073
What war was that?
The Crimean War, no doubt.

189
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:16,537
You'll like Brogan-Moore,
he's had excellent training. Under me.

190
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:20,622
This morning I had no lawyers at all
and now suddenly I have three.

191
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,511
We should explain
that I have very little money.

192
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:25,963
I shan't be able to pay
all the costs and fees.

193
00:15:26,098 --> 00:15:28,387
We'll get a fourth lawyer to sue you.

194
00:15:28,517 --> 00:15:31,637
He won't get very much.
I haven't had a job in four months.

195
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:34,807
- What sort of work do you do?
- Well, uh...

196
00:15:34,941 --> 00:15:40,397
My last job was as a mechanic.
The foreman kept riding me all the time.

197
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,863
- I took it as long as I could, then I quit.
- And before that?

198
00:15:43,991 --> 00:15:48,285
I worked in a department store, in toys,
demonstrating children's building sets.

199
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:53,324
Of course, it lasted only during Christmas.
Before that I tested electric blankets.

200
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:58,205
- Electric blankets?
- I suppose you think I'm a bit of a drifter.

201
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:00,913
It's true, in a way,
but I'm really not like that.

202
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:05,593
My army service unsettled me. That and
living abroad. I was stationed in Germany.

203
00:16:05,722 --> 00:16:08,426
It was fine there, though.
That's where I met my wife.

204
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:13,184
She was an actress, and a good one.
She's a wonderful wife to me, too.

205
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:16,017
But I haven't been much of a provider,
I'm afraid.

206
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:20,727
Somehow, I just don't seem able to settle
down now I've come back to this country.

207
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:24,942
- If I could just put my eggbeater across.
- Eggbeater?

208
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:30,740
Yes, sir. I, uh, I'm a bit of an inventor.
Nothing big, just little household things.

209
00:16:30,872 --> 00:16:34,039
Pocket pencil sharpeners,
key chain flashlights.

210
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,456
But my best is really this eggbeater.

211
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:40,037
It not only beats,
it also separates the yolk from the white.

212
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:42,581
Is that really desirable?

213
00:16:42,717 --> 00:16:45,255
If you were a housewife,
you'd see it right away.

214
00:16:45,386 --> 00:16:48,637
The trouble is, I need money
for manufacturing and promotion.

215
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:52,810
I was really hoping that's what Mrs
French might do for me after I met her.

216
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:58,310
- Exactly how did you meet Mrs French?
- That's rather funny in itself.

217
00:16:58,441 --> 00:17:02,225
It was 3 September. I remember
because it's my wife's birthday.

218
00:17:02,362 --> 00:17:05,197
I was window-shopping in Oxford Street,

219
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:10,281
daydreaming about what I'd buy for her,
if I had any money.

220
00:17:57,292 --> 00:17:59,368
- You really like this one?
- Very much.

221
00:17:59,503 --> 00:18:02,041
- You don't think it's too mad?
- Mad?

222
00:18:02,172 --> 00:18:06,633
Not at all. Daring, perhaps. I wouldn't
recommend it to every woman. But you?

223
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,631
- Why shouldn't you attract attention?
- You think so?

224
00:18:09,763 --> 00:18:13,179
Absolutely. But if I could
suggest one little thing.

225
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:17,638
Perhaps we could tip it and bring it back
a bit like that. Show more of your face.

226
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:18,934
<i>(squealing brakes)</i>

227
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,899
- My bus. Goodbye.
- Good...

228
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:25,523
You buy that hat. I insist.

229
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:31,192
Actually, it was a ridiculous sort of hat -
a silly thing with ribbons and flowers.

230
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:35,787
I'm constantly surprised that women's
hats do not provoke more murders.

231
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,243
Go on, please.

232
00:18:37,374 --> 00:18:39,948
I was only trying to be nice
to make her feel good.

233
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,374
I never dreamed I'd see her again.
Or the hat.

234
00:18:42,504 --> 00:18:44,746
- But you did?
- Yes, a few weeks later.

235
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:50,552
Again, by accident. I was peddling my
eggbeaters and business was a little slow.

236
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:55,726
<i>(gunfire and action-sequence music)</i>

237
00:19:14,036 --> 00:19:17,072
Would you mind, madam? Your hat.

238
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:19,578
- Oh, it's you!
- Hello!

239
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:23,077
It's your fault, you know.
You chose it yourself.

240
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:25,454
- May I?
- Sure, if you like.

241
00:19:29,343 --> 00:19:34,005
Thank you. It's such a bother
taking it off and putting it back on again.

242
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:39,181
That chap is Jesse James. They've led
him into an ambush. It's not at all cricket.

243
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,802
- Don't worry, he shoots his way out.
- He does?

244
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:44,726
- I've seen it. I got to the movies a lot.
- You do?

245
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:50,197
I get restless so I go out. Then I find
I've no place to go so I go to the movies.

246
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:54,534
Sometimes I see the same one
two or three times. Ooh.

247
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,282
- Toffee?
- Oh, yes, please.

248
00:19:57,413 --> 00:20:00,414
At this time you had no idea
that Mrs French was well-off?

249
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,708
No. Absolutely not.
We were sitting in the cheap seats.

250
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:07,668
All I knew was she seemed to be
very lonely, had no friends whatsoever.

251
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:10,586
She and her husband
lived abroad in British Nigeria.

252
00:20:10,718 --> 00:20:15,297
He was in the colonial service.
He died in '45, of a heart attack.

253
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:18,717
Please, Mayhew, not when I'm smoking.
Go on, young man.

254
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:22,054
Well, they finally
polished off Jesse James,

255
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:25,639
and after we left the movie
she invited me to her house for tea.

256
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:27,814
<i>(Mrs French laughs)</i>

257
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,520
I think it's the most fascinating thing
I've ever seen. Janet, come and look.

258
00:20:33,658 --> 00:20:35,697
I've seen eggbeaters before, ma'am.

259
00:20:35,827 --> 00:20:38,911
But this beats so quickly
and it separates too!

260
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,075
It must be cen-trifugal
or centrifugal, which is it?

261
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,829
It's specific gravity,
but it whips cream too.

262
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:48,081
Did you hear that, Janet?
It whips cream too.

263
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,705
We must have one. Is it expensive?

264
00:20:50,842 --> 00:20:54,293
Compliments of the inventor,
manufacturer and sole distributor.

265
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:58,426
Thank you. We'll use it constantly,
won't we, Janet?

266
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:03,184
Come, we'd better get out of here.
Janet doesn't like visitors in her kitchen.

267
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:11,652
Ha!

268
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:16,906
It's a bit chilly in here, isn't it?
Shall we have a fire?

269
00:21:17,035 --> 00:21:19,074
Why not?

270
00:21:19,204 --> 00:21:21,873
This is a charming room.

271
00:21:21,998 --> 00:21:26,292
Hubert and I collected all these things
when we lived in Africa.

272
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:28,661
Hubert was my husband.

273
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:32,508
Well, now, there's a loveable chap.

274
00:21:32,634 --> 00:21:35,125
That's the mask of the witch doctor.

275
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,752
He wore it when he pulled
our servants' teeth.

276
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:41,638
So Hubert used to call him a witch dentist.

277
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:45,936
- Hubert was so witty.
- Yes, I can see that.

278
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:48,270
Oh, here's tea.

279
00:21:50,694 --> 00:21:55,439
- Let's use our good silver and china.
- Oh, no, don't bother, Mrs French.

280
00:21:55,574 --> 00:21:58,574
- This is perfectly all right.
- Lemon or milk, please?

281
00:21:58,702 --> 00:22:01,157
- I don't really care.
- Would you prefer sherry?

282
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:03,327
- That'd be fine.
- We've no' got any.

283
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:07,786
Oh, but we have. There's that bottle,
the one we bought last Christmas.

284
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,914
If you care for an eggnog there's a wasted
egg in the kitchen ready and separated.

285
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:17,925
Do sit down. Don't mind Janet, Mr Vole.
It's just that she's terribly Scotch.

286
00:22:18,054 --> 00:22:21,589
Oh, is she? I thought
she came with the collection.

287
00:22:22,684 --> 00:22:26,634
You know, maybe
I'll take a glass of sherry myself.

288
00:22:26,772 --> 00:22:29,559
I feel like Christmas, somehow.

289
00:22:30,776 --> 00:22:35,438
After that I saw her once or twice a week.
She always kept a bottle of sherry for me.

290
00:22:35,572 --> 00:22:38,608
We'd talk, play canasta,
listen to gramophone records,

291
00:22:38,742 --> 00:22:40,948
Gilbert and Sullivan mostly.

292
00:22:41,078 --> 00:22:45,407
It's so weird to think of her now,
lying in that living room, murdered.

293
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:50,084
I assure you she's been moved by now.
To leave her would be unfeeling, unlawful,

294
00:22:50,212 --> 00:22:52,251
and unsanitary.

295
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:57,546
Tell Sir Wilfrid about
the evening of the murder.

296
00:22:58,303 --> 00:23:00,925
I went around to see her
about eight o'clock.

297
00:23:01,056 --> 00:23:04,010
<i>She fixed a sandwich,
we talked, listened to The Mikado.</i>

298
00:23:04,142 --> 00:23:08,223
I left about nine. I walked home.
I got there about half past.

299
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:12,483
I can prove that. I can swear to it, in or out
of court, in the witness box, anywhere!

300
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:15,279
How much money did you get
from Mrs French?

301
00:23:15,404 --> 00:23:17,480
- Nothing.
- The truth. How much?

302
00:23:17,614 --> 00:23:21,363
- Why should she give me any money?
- Because she was in love with you.

303
00:23:21,493 --> 00:23:23,533
That's ridiculous. She liked me.

304
00:23:23,662 --> 00:23:26,699
She pampered me like an aunt.
But that's all, I swear.

305
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:29,584
- Why didn't you tell her you had a wife?
- I did!

306
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,043
But you never took your wife along
when you went there. Why not?

307
00:23:33,172 --> 00:23:34,999
- Because...
- Because what?

308
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:38,715
Because she was under the impression
we didn't get along too well.

309
00:23:38,844 --> 00:23:41,252
- Is that true?
- No! We love each other.

310
00:23:41,388 --> 00:23:45,338
- Then how did she get that impression?
- She just seemed to want to believe it.

311
00:23:45,476 --> 00:23:48,892
- You never corrected her. Why?
- I was afraid she'd lose interest.

312
00:23:49,021 --> 00:23:52,390
Because she was rich,
and you were after her money.

313
00:23:52,524 --> 00:23:54,601
Well, yes, in a way.

314
00:23:55,236 --> 00:24:00,063
I was hoping for a loan for my new
invention. Just a few hundred pounds.

315
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:03,484
An honest business proposition, that's all.
Is that so wicked?

316
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:05,777
You knew it was
the housekeeper's day off?

317
00:24:05,913 --> 00:24:08,618
- Well, yes.
- You went there because she'd be alone?

318
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:11,287
No, because I thought
she might be lonely.

319
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:15,203
All right, lonely. You and the rich
lonely widow all alone in that house

320
00:24:15,339 --> 00:24:18,210
<i>with a gramophone blaring The Mikado.</i>

321
00:24:18,342 --> 00:24:21,011
Perhaps you turned up
the volume to drown her cries.

322
00:24:21,137 --> 00:24:25,763
- When I left her she was alive!
- When Janet came back she was dead.

323
00:24:25,891 --> 00:24:29,841
The house had been ransacked! It said
in the papers. It must've been a burglar.

324
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:33,312
I didn't do it. No matter
how bad things look, I didn't do it!

325
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:37,770
You must believe me.
You do believe me, don't you?

326
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:40,902
I do now, but I wasn't sure.

327
00:24:41,032 --> 00:24:44,531
That's why I subjected your eyes
and my arteries to that ordeal.

328
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,949
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

329
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:50,994
As for things looking bad, they
don't look bad, Mr Vole, they look terrible.

330
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:55,454
- Apparently you've no alibi at all.
- But I have. I left Mrs French's at nine.

331
00:24:55,588 --> 00:24:58,921
- By bus or underground?
- No, I walked. It was a fine night.

332
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:02,086
- Did anyone see you?
- Christine saw me when I got home.

333
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,380
It was 9.26. I know because I went right to
work on a clock I've been tinkering with.

334
00:25:07,517 --> 00:25:10,268
- My wife will tell you.
- Your wife loves you, yes?

335
00:25:10,394 --> 00:25:12,720
Very much.
We're devoted to each other.

336
00:25:12,855 --> 00:25:18,098
You realise, Mr Vole, the testimony of a
devoted wife does not carry much weight.

337
00:25:18,236 --> 00:25:20,987
People might think
Christine would lie on my account?

338
00:25:21,114 --> 00:25:25,063
It has been known, Mr Vole.
Blood is thicker than evidence.

339
00:25:26,285 --> 00:25:31,078
- Ah, Brogan-Moore. Come in, come in.
- So good to have you out of hospital.

340
00:25:31,207 --> 00:25:36,083
I didn't get a full pardon, I'm out on
parole. You know Mr Mayhew, I believe.

341
00:25:36,212 --> 00:25:38,999
- This is his client, Mr Leonard Vole.
- How do you do?

342
00:25:39,132 --> 00:25:41,504
- How do you do?
- The Emily French murder.

343
00:25:41,634 --> 00:25:44,006
<i>- Oh, how do you do?
- Badly, thank you.</i>

344
00:25:44,137 --> 00:25:48,181
A mass of circumstantial evidence.
No alibi whatsoever. It's a hot potato.

345
00:25:48,308 --> 00:25:50,633
- Tossing it into your lap.
- Much obliged.

346
00:25:50,768 --> 00:25:53,888
Your line of defence,
however, will be lack of motive.

347
00:25:54,022 --> 00:25:57,142
You will agree that we can rule out
a crime of passion, hm?

348
00:25:57,275 --> 00:26:00,062
That leaves us with a murder for profit.

349
00:26:00,195 --> 00:26:04,323
If Mr Vole had been sponging off Mrs
French, why cut off the source of supply?

350
00:26:04,449 --> 00:26:09,075
Or, if he'd been hoping for a golden egg,
why kill the goose before it was laid?

351
00:26:09,204 --> 00:26:12,240
No motive. No motive whatsoever.

352
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:18,786
- You find some flaw in this reasoning?
- No, no, it's very sound as far as it goes.

353
00:26:18,922 --> 00:26:23,299
Well, it's all yours. You'll find Mr Vole
very responsive and quite candid.

354
00:26:23,426 --> 00:26:26,795
So candid, he's already told me
we'll have to sue him for our fees.

355
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:30,762
Oh, we'll simply put a lean
on Mr Vole's £80,000.

356
00:26:30,892 --> 00:26:35,305
- What? 80,000?
- The? 80,000 Mrs French left you.

357
00:26:35,438 --> 00:26:36,601
Left me?

358
00:26:36,731 --> 00:26:41,892
They opened Mrs French's
bank vault today and found her will.

359
00:26:42,737 --> 00:26:47,067
- Congratulations.
- ? 80,000!

360
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,783
And I was worried about a couple
of hundred for that silly eggbeater.

361
00:26:50,912 --> 00:26:52,952
I must call Christine.

362
00:26:57,043 --> 00:26:58,538
Oh.

363
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,671
This doesn't make things
look any better for me, does it?

364
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:05,250
- No. I wouldn't think so.
- So now they'll say I did have a motive.

365
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:10,925
They will indeed.? 80,000 makes for
a very handsome motive.

366
00:27:11,058 --> 00:27:13,727
I thought you were crazy
but now they will arrest me!

367
00:27:13,852 --> 00:27:15,892
It's not unlikely.

368
00:27:16,897 --> 00:27:19,388
<i>(car pulls up)</i>

369
00:27:23,236 --> 00:27:26,652
As a matter of fact, it's quite likely.
They're on their way up now.

370
00:27:26,782 --> 00:27:31,325
I knew nothing about that will. I'd no idea
she'd any intention of leaving me money.

371
00:27:31,453 --> 00:27:35,866
- If I didn't know, how can it be a motive?
- We'll certainly bring that out in court.

372
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:40,542
- It's our old friend Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector as of last month.

373
00:27:40,671 --> 00:27:44,336
Chief Inspector? They must think
a lot of you at Scotland Yard.

374
00:27:44,466 --> 00:27:47,136
You're getting the de luxe treatment.

375
00:27:47,261 --> 00:27:52,635
- Oh, in here, Chief Inspector.
- Sorry to disturb you in your chambers.

376
00:27:52,766 --> 00:27:56,515
That's perfectly all right.
I never object to the actions of the police

377
00:27:56,645 --> 00:28:00,477
- except once in a great while in court.
- Yes, sir, I still have the scars.

378
00:28:00,607 --> 00:28:03,063
You know Mr Mayhew, Mr Brogan-Moore.

379
00:28:03,193 --> 00:28:07,772
This is Leonard Vole. You'd better search
him, he may be armed with an eggbeater.

380
00:28:07,906 --> 00:28:10,576
- Is your name Leonard Vole?
- Yes, it is.

381
00:28:10,701 --> 00:28:16,407
I have a warrant for your arrest
on the charge of murdering Emily French.

382
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:21,535
I must warn you that anything you say
may be taken down and used in evidence.

383
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,624
Well, I'm ready. Must I be handcuffed?

384
00:28:24,757 --> 00:28:27,248
That won't be necessary, sir.

385
00:28:27,384 --> 00:28:30,919
I've never been arrested before,
not even for walking a dog off a lead

386
00:28:31,055 --> 00:28:34,887
- or having a beer after hours.
- There's no disgrace in being arrested.

387
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:40,391
Kings, prime ministers, archbishops,
even barristers have stood in the dock.

388
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,858
- Somebody better call my wife.
- I will, don't worry.

389
00:28:48,989 --> 00:28:51,196
I'll go too, see you're properly charged.

390
00:28:51,325 --> 00:28:54,243
- You will see to it that he is well-treated?
- We will.

391
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:58,154
Would you like a cigar? Pardon me.

392
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:04,208
- That's very kind of you, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'd better not. It would constitute a bribe.

393
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,879
We ought to be going, Mr Vole.

394
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:16,177
One thing I've learned for sure, never
look in a window with women's hats.

395
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:18,348
Good day, sir.

396
00:29:20,313 --> 00:29:22,601
Makes a very nice impression,
doesn't he?

397
00:29:22,732 --> 00:29:27,026
- Yes, rather. Give him the monocle test?
- Passed with flying colours.

398
00:29:27,153 --> 00:29:30,688
I hope he does as well in the dock.
This is sticky, you know.

399
00:29:30,823 --> 00:29:34,655
Of course. The prosecution will
blast in with their heaviest artillery.

400
00:29:34,785 --> 00:29:39,329
All you'll have is one little popgun,
an alibi furnished by his wife.

401
00:29:39,457 --> 00:29:41,533
Isn't that an intriguing challenge?

402
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:45,665
I think I'd like it more if it was less
of a challenge and less intriguing.

403
00:29:46,547 --> 00:29:51,708
Miss Plimsoll has issued an ultimatum.
In bed in one minute or she'll resign.

404
00:29:51,844 --> 00:29:55,213
Splendid. Give her a month's pay
and kick her down the stairs.

405
00:29:55,348 --> 00:29:58,468
Either you take care of yourself
or I, too, shall resign.

406
00:29:58,601 --> 00:30:01,175
This is blackmail.
But you're quite right.

407
00:30:01,312 --> 00:30:05,440
For my first day this has already
been rather hectic. I should be in bed.

408
00:30:09,487 --> 00:30:13,401
I'd better get in touch with Mrs Vole
and have her come over. Will you sit in?

409
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:19,737
Thank you, no. I'm in no condition to cope
with emotional wives drenched in tears.

410
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:25,991
Miss Plimsoll, how alluring you look,
waiting like a hangman on the scaffold.

411
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:28,371
Take me, I'm yours.

412
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,131
Oh!

413
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:35,838
About Mrs Vole. Handle her gently,
especially when you tell her of the arrest.

414
00:30:35,972 --> 00:30:40,717
Bear in mind she's a foreigner, so prepare
for hysterics, even a fainting spell.

415
00:30:40,852 --> 00:30:45,015
Better have smelling salts ready,
box of tissues and a nip of brandy.

416
00:30:45,148 --> 00:30:48,683
<i>(woman) I do not think
that will be necessary.</i>

417
00:30:51,738 --> 00:30:54,311
I never faint in case I don't fall gracefully,

418
00:30:54,449 --> 00:30:58,281
and I never use smelling salts
because they puff up the eyes.

419
00:30:58,411 --> 00:31:00,902
I'm Christine Vole.

420
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,660
How do you do?
This is Mr Brogan-Moore.

421
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:05,831
How do you do?

422
00:31:05,961 --> 00:31:08,997
- I am Wilfrid Robarts.
- How do you do?

423
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,048
My dear Mrs Vole, I'm afraid
we have bad news for you.

424
00:31:12,175 --> 00:31:17,170
- Don't be afraid, I'm quite disciplined.
- There's nothing to be alarmed about yet.

425
00:31:17,305 --> 00:31:20,888
Leonard has been arrested
and charged with murder. Is that it?

426
00:31:21,017 --> 00:31:24,469
- Yes.
- I knew he would be, I told him so.

427
00:31:24,604 --> 00:31:27,226
I'm glad you're showing such fortitude.

428
00:31:27,357 --> 00:31:30,441
Call it what you like.
What is the next step?

429
00:31:31,027 --> 00:31:33,649
Your husband will have
to stand trial, I'm afraid.

430
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:38,987
Will you explain the procedure?
Mr Brogan-Moore will lead the defence.

431
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,494
Oh?

432
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,456
- You will not defend Leonard?
- Regrettably not.

433
00:31:43,582 --> 00:31:46,155
My health, or, rather,
the lack of it, forbids me.

434
00:31:46,293 --> 00:31:51,749
It is regrettable. Mr Mayhew described
you as champion of the hopeless cause.

435
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:58,876
Is it, perhaps,
that this cause is too hopeless?

436
00:32:05,938 --> 00:32:10,932
I'll have a serious talk with Dr Harrison. It
was a mistake to let you come back here.

437
00:32:11,068 --> 00:32:13,689
I should have taken you
to a rest-home or a resort.

438
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,276
Some place quiet, far off, like Bermuda.

439
00:32:16,406 --> 00:32:19,360
Shut up. You just want
to see me in those nasty shorts.

440
00:32:19,493 --> 00:32:22,778
Come now, Sir Wilfrid,
you must not think of it.

441
00:32:22,913 --> 00:32:26,911
You must get ready for sleep,
think beautiful thoughts.

442
00:32:27,793 --> 00:32:33,249
Now, let's get undressed. Put these on,
tops and bottoms, while I make your bed.

443
00:32:33,382 --> 00:32:36,418
After your rest
we'll have a nice cup of cocoa.

444
00:32:36,552 --> 00:32:39,636
Then perhaps
we'll have a walk around the square.

445
00:32:39,763 --> 00:32:42,433
You know, I feel sorry
for that nice Mr Vole.

446
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:47,101
And not just because he was arrested,
but that wife of his. She must be German.

447
00:32:47,229 --> 00:32:51,891
That's what happens when we let our
boys cross the Channel. They go crazy.

448
00:32:52,026 --> 00:32:56,604
The government should do something
about foreign wives. Like an embargo.

449
00:32:56,739 --> 00:33:00,653
How else can we take care of our own
surplus. Don't you agree, Sir Wilfrid?

450
00:33:00,784 --> 00:33:03,192
All right. Hop in!

451
00:33:04,288 --> 00:33:06,696
Sir Wilfrid?

452
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:11,245
Sir Wilfrid!

453
00:33:11,378 --> 00:33:13,170
Come back!

454
00:33:13,547 --> 00:33:18,293
Yes, of course I knew that Leonard had
been seeing Mrs French quite frequently.

455
00:33:18,427 --> 00:33:19,590
Go on.

456
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,469
I knew when he came home with a pair
of green socks she'd knitted for him.

457
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:26,802
That's quite natural.
I'm sure a jury will find it endearing.

458
00:33:26,936 --> 00:33:30,933
Leonard can be very endearing.
He hates that particular shade of green

459
00:33:31,065 --> 00:33:33,223
and the socks were two sizes too large,

460
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:36,064
but he wore them just the same
to give her pleasure.

461
00:33:36,195 --> 00:33:38,235
Leonard has a way with women.

462
00:33:38,364 --> 00:33:44,153
I only hope he has an all-woman jury.
They will carry him from court in triumph.

463
00:33:44,286 --> 00:33:49,328
A simple acquittal will do. Now, you know
Mrs French left your husband money?

464
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:51,534
Yes. A lot of money.

465
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:56,545
Of course, your husband had
no previous knowledge of this bequest?

466
00:33:56,674 --> 00:33:58,916
Is that what he told you?

467
00:33:59,051 --> 00:34:01,542
Surely you're not suggesting different?

468
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,724
Oh, no, no. I do not suggest anything.

469
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:11,722
Clearly, she had come to look upon your
husband as a son or favourite nephew.

470
00:34:12,356 --> 00:34:16,188
You think Mrs French looked
upon Leonard as a son? Or a nephew?

471
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:19,984
I do. An entirely natural
and understandable relationship.

472
00:34:20,114 --> 00:34:23,483
What hypocrites you are in this country.

473
00:34:25,286 --> 00:34:27,658
Pardon me, Brogan-Moore.

474
00:34:27,789 --> 00:34:32,415
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- Go right ahead, Sir Wilfrid.

475
00:34:32,543 --> 00:34:36,588
You realise your husband's entire
defence rests on his word and yours?

476
00:34:36,714 --> 00:34:40,130
- I realise that.
- And that the jury will be quite sceptical

477
00:34:40,259 --> 00:34:44,388
of the word of a man accused of murder
when supported only by that of his wife?

478
00:34:44,514 --> 00:34:47,349
- I realise that too.
- Let us, then, at least make sure

479
00:34:47,475 --> 00:34:51,307
- the two are not in conflict.
- By all means, let's.

480
00:34:51,437 --> 00:34:54,107
I assume you want to help your husband?

481
00:34:54,232 --> 00:34:59,902
Of course I want to help Leonard. I want
to help Mr Brogan-Moore and to help you.

482
00:35:00,029 --> 00:35:04,157
There. Isn't that
more comfortable for you?

483
00:35:04,784 --> 00:35:08,070
Now, Mrs Vole. This is very important.

484
00:35:08,204 --> 00:35:12,119
On the night of the murder your husband
came home before 9.30. Correct?

485
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,666
Precisely. Isn't that
what he wants me to say?

486
00:35:15,795 --> 00:35:17,752
Isn't it the truth?

487
00:35:17,881 --> 00:35:19,754
Of course.

488
00:35:19,883 --> 00:35:22,800
But when I told the police,
I do not think they believed me.

489
00:35:22,927 --> 00:35:26,131
Maybe I didn't say it well.
Maybe because of my accent.

490
00:35:26,264 --> 00:35:28,553
My dear Mrs Vole, in our courts

491
00:35:28,683 --> 00:35:31,969
we accept the evidence
of witnesses who speak only Bulgarian

492
00:35:32,103 --> 00:35:34,725
and who must have an interpreter.

493
00:35:34,856 --> 00:35:38,142
We accept the evidence
of deaf-mutes who cannot speak at all,

494
00:35:38,276 --> 00:35:40,648
as long as they tell the truth.

495
00:35:40,779 --> 00:35:44,148
You're aware that when you're
in the witness box you will be sworn

496
00:35:44,282 --> 00:35:47,367
- and you will testify under oath?
- Yes.

497
00:35:47,494 --> 00:35:51,361
Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely
and did not go out again.

498
00:35:51,498 --> 00:35:56,658
The truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth. Is that better?

499
00:35:58,171 --> 00:36:03,332
- Mrs Vole, do you love your husband?
- Leonard thinks I do.

500
00:36:03,468 --> 00:36:07,217
- Well, do you?
- Am I already under oath?

501
00:36:07,347 --> 00:36:10,681
Whatever your gambit may be,
do you know that, under British law,

502
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:14,854
you cannot be called to give testimony
damaging to your husband?

503
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,186
How very convenient.

504
00:36:17,315 --> 00:36:19,474
We are dealing with a capital crime.

505
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:23,393
The prosecution
will try to hang your husband.

506
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:27,159
He is not my husband.

507
00:36:33,498 --> 00:36:35,989
Leonard and I went through
a form of marriage,

508
00:36:36,126 --> 00:36:40,040
but I had a husband living somewhere
in East Germany, in the Russian zone.

509
00:36:40,172 --> 00:36:44,122
- Did you tell Leonard?
- I did not. It would have been stupid.

510
00:36:44,259 --> 00:36:48,387
He would not have married me and
I'd have been left to starve in the rubble.

511
00:36:48,513 --> 00:36:51,135
But he did marry you
and brought you safely here.

512
00:36:51,266 --> 00:36:53,555
Don't you think you should be grateful?

513
00:36:53,685 --> 00:36:55,808
One can get very tired of gratitude.

514
00:36:55,938 --> 00:36:58,642
Your husband loves you
very much, does he not?

515
00:36:58,774 --> 00:37:02,059
Leonard?
He worships the ground I walk on.

516
00:37:02,194 --> 00:37:04,400
And you?

517
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,902
You want to know too much.

518
00:37:07,032 --> 00:37:09,488
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, gentlemen.</i>

519
00:37:10,577 --> 00:37:15,998
Thank you for coming in, Mrs Vole.
Your visit has been most reassuring.

520
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:20,833
Do not worry, Sir Wilfrid. I will give him
an alibi and I shall be very convincing.

521
00:37:20,963 --> 00:37:25,957
There will be tears in my eyes when I say
"Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely."

522
00:37:26,093 --> 00:37:29,960
You're a very remarkable woman,
Mrs Vole.

523
00:37:31,056 --> 00:37:33,512
And you're satisfied, I hope?

524
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:40,475
- I'm damned if I'm satisfied!
- Care for a whiff of those smelling salts?

525
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:43,145
That woman's up to something. But what?

526
00:37:43,277 --> 00:37:47,322
The prosecution will break her down
in no time when she's in the witness box.

527
00:37:47,448 --> 00:37:50,947
This case is going to be rather
like the charge of the Light Brigade

528
00:37:51,076 --> 00:37:54,860
or one of those Japanese suicide pilots.
Quite one-sided.

529
00:37:54,997 --> 00:37:57,405
With the odds all on the other side.

530
00:37:57,541 --> 00:38:00,079
I haven't got much to go on, have I?

531
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,784
The fact is, I've got nothing.

532
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,087
Let me ask you something.

533
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:09,716
Do you believe Leonard Vole is innocent?

534
00:38:12,681 --> 00:38:14,721
Do you?

535
00:38:16,102 --> 00:38:18,509
Do you?

536
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:20,685
I'm not sure.

537
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:24,397
Oh, I'm sorry, Wilfrid.
Of course, I'll do my best.

538
00:38:24,527 --> 00:38:27,314
It's all right, Brogan-Moore.

539
00:38:27,446 --> 00:38:30,116
I'll take it from here.

540
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:36,450
I have called Dr Harrison and given him
a report on your shocking behaviour.

541
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:39,036
- Give me a match, Miss Plimsoll.
- Sir Wilfrid!

542
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:42,203
Did you hear me? A match!

543
00:39:13,993 --> 00:39:19,996
Mr Mayhew. Sir Wilfrid. I'm told you are
going to represent me. I'm very grateful.

544
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:25,498
I struck a bargain with my doctors. They
exile me to Bermuda as soon as we finish.

545
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,251
- Thank you.
- There's hope that we'll both survive.

546
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:30,624
- Get into these. We need a photograph.
- Why?

547
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,800
This is what you were wearing that night.

548
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:36,843
We'll circulate a photo on the chance
that someone saw you on your way home.

549
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:39,430
Over here against the wall, please.

550
00:39:41,938 --> 00:39:44,809
Hold it.
One more in profile, please.

551
00:39:44,941 --> 00:39:48,476
Do we really need this? My wife knows
what time I came home that night.

552
00:39:48,611 --> 00:39:51,316
A disinterested witness
may be of more value.

553
00:39:51,447 --> 00:39:54,318
Yes, of course,
Christine is an interested witness.

554
00:39:54,451 --> 00:39:56,739
I'll pick up the negatives later. Thank you.

555
00:39:56,870 --> 00:40:00,998
I don't understand it.
Why hasn't she come to see me?

556
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:05,701
Won't they let her see me?
I mean, it's been two weeks now.

557
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:08,458
Mayhew, give me the reports.

558
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:11,756
Have you been talking to her?
Is there something the matter?

559
00:40:11,885 --> 00:40:17,010
I want to read a portion of the evidence
of Janet McKenzie, the housekeeper.

560
00:40:21,061 --> 00:40:24,643
"Mr Vole helped Mrs French
with her business affairs,

561
00:40:24,773 --> 00:40:26,896
particularly her income tax returns."

562
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:29,942
Oh, yes, I did. Some of those forms
are very complicated.

563
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,355
There's also a hint you may
have helped her draft her new will.

564
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:36,491
Well, that's not true!
If Janet said that she's lying.

565
00:40:36,618 --> 00:40:39,323
She was always against me,
I don't know why!

566
00:40:39,454 --> 00:40:45,658
It's obvious. You threw an eggbeater into
the wheels of her Victorian household.

567
00:40:45,794 --> 00:40:49,542
Now, this cut in your wrist.
You say you cut yourself with a knife?

568
00:40:49,673 --> 00:40:53,373
Well, that's true, I did.
I was cutting bread and the knife slipped.

569
00:40:53,510 --> 00:41:00,224
But that was two days after. Christine
was there. She'll tell them in her evidence.

570
00:41:01,476 --> 00:41:05,640
Are you keeping something from me?
Is she ill? Was she shocked?

571
00:41:05,772 --> 00:41:09,817
All things considered, she took it well.
Though that may be only on the surface.

572
00:41:09,943 --> 00:41:13,442
Wives are often profoundly
disturbed at such a time.

573
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:16,573
Yes, it must be hard.
We've never been separated before.

574
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,029
- Not since our first meeting.
- How did you meet your wife, Mr Vole?

575
00:41:21,163 --> 00:41:23,202
In Germany in 1945.

576
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:30,003
It's rather funny. The very first time
I saw her, the ceiling fell right in on me.

577
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:33,879
<i>I was stationed outside Hamburg,
with an RAF maintenance unit.</i>

578
00:41:34,009 --> 00:41:39,549
<i>I'd just installed a shower in the officers'
billet, so they gave me a weekend pass.</i>

579
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:41,721
<i>(music and cheers)</i>

580
00:41:42,976 --> 00:41:43,972
<i>(woman) Come on!</i>

581
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:45,645
[ Join the party ]

582
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:48,855
[ Have a hearty glass of rum ]

583
00:41:48,982 --> 00:41:52,601
[ Don't ever think about tomorrow ]

584
00:41:52,736 --> 00:41:55,821
[ For tomorrow may never come ]

585
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:00,276
[ When I find me a happy place ]

586
00:42:00,411 --> 00:42:03,447
[ That's where I wanna stay ]

587
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:10,461
[ Time is nothing
as long as I'm living it up this way ]

588
00:42:10,587 --> 00:42:15,415
[ I may never go home any more ]

589
00:42:15,551 --> 00:42:18,967
[ Dim the lights
and start locking the door ]

590
00:42:19,096 --> 00:42:22,382
[ Give your arms to me
Give your charms to me ]

591
00:42:22,516 --> 00:42:26,099
[ After all that's what sailors are for ]

592
00:42:26,228 --> 00:42:31,223
[ I've got kisses and kisses galore ]

593
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:34,644
[ That have never been tasted before ]

594
00:42:34,778 --> 00:42:38,029
[ If you treat me right
This could be the night ]

595
00:42:38,157 --> 00:42:39,699
[ I may never go home ]

596
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,445
[ I may never go home ]

597
00:42:41,702 --> 00:42:43,362
[ I may never go home ]

598
00:42:43,621 --> 00:42:45,115
[ I may never go home ]

599
00:42:45,247 --> 00:42:48,747
[ I may never go home any more ]

600
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:57,380
[ I may never go home any more ]

601
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:00,676
<i>Hey, Fräulein, show us some legs.</i>

602
00:43:00,805 --> 00:43:04,933
They rob you blind
and then throw you a ruddy sailor!

603
00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:08,594
- Come on, let's see 'em.
- We want legs!

604
00:43:09,355 --> 00:43:12,558
Come help the cabaret out of her trousers!

605
00:43:12,692 --> 00:43:16,025
<i>All right, Fräulein,
if you won't show 'em, I will.</i>

606
00:43:16,153 --> 00:43:18,193
<i>(cheering)</i>

607
00:43:26,622 --> 00:43:28,662
<i>(whistle)</i>

608
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:47,218
All right, outside, everybody.
Come on, let's go.

609
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:02,069
Come on.

610
00:44:03,951 --> 00:44:06,822
Bring him round to the other truck.

611
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:13,953
We'll be back, baby! We'll be back!

612
00:44:51,374 --> 00:44:53,414
Gesundheit.

613
00:45:00,258 --> 00:45:03,010
- What are you looking for?
- My accordion.

614
00:45:03,136 --> 00:45:05,212
Oh, let me help you.

615
00:45:05,347 --> 00:45:07,386
<i>(discordant noise)</i>

616
00:45:08,475 --> 00:45:12,473
- I think I found it.
- Step on it again, it's still breathing.

617
00:45:12,604 --> 00:45:14,063
<i>(discordant noise)</i>

618
00:45:14,189 --> 00:45:16,596
I'm terribly sorry.

619
00:45:16,733 --> 00:45:19,022
You better go. We've had trouble enough.

620
00:45:19,152 --> 00:45:23,197
Well, it's your own fault. That costume
in the picture gave the boys ideas

621
00:45:23,323 --> 00:45:27,700
- then those trousers let them down hard.
- That costume went in the first raid.

622
00:45:27,828 --> 00:45:31,362
Then raid by raid, my other dresses,
and now you've bombed my trousers.

623
00:45:31,498 --> 00:45:33,537
Cigarette? Gum?

624
00:45:42,509 --> 00:45:44,798
You're burning my nose.

625
00:45:44,928 --> 00:45:47,419
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

626
00:45:47,556 --> 00:45:50,094
How about a cup of coffee?
I've got a tin of coffee.

627
00:45:50,225 --> 00:45:51,767
How much?

628
00:45:51,893 --> 00:45:54,052
I don't know.
What's the rate of exchange?

629
00:45:54,187 --> 00:45:58,137
- Depends whether it's fresh or powdered.
- It's instant coffee.

630
00:45:58,275 --> 00:46:00,314
Got any hot water at your place?

631
00:46:00,444 --> 00:46:03,860
- Sometimes.
- Let's take a chance. Where do you live?

632
00:46:03,989 --> 00:46:05,613
Nearby.

633
00:46:06,491 --> 00:46:08,318
Come.

634
00:46:14,708 --> 00:46:16,831
Sorry, it's the maid's night off.

635
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,579
<i>This is pretty horrible.
In a gemütlich sort of way.</i>

636
00:46:20,714 --> 00:46:24,297
Oh, it's fine now.
I used to have a roommate. A dancer.

637
00:46:24,426 --> 00:46:27,795
She had luck, she married a Canadian.
She now lives in Toronto.

638
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:30,681
She has a Ford automobile.

639
00:46:30,808 --> 00:46:33,892
Make yourself comfortable,
the stove is slow these days.

640
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:37,269
That's all right, I've got a weekend pass.

641
00:46:37,398 --> 00:46:41,016
No, not that chair. It holds up the
beam and that holds up the ceiling.

642
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,523
You'd better sit down on the cot.

643
00:46:43,654 --> 00:46:45,362
The cot?

644
00:46:45,489 --> 00:46:49,024
<i>Getting more gemütlich all the time.
Are you married?</i>

645
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:51,069
- Why?
- Well, the, um...

646
00:46:51,203 --> 00:46:53,824
Oh, that. No, no, I'm not married.

647
00:46:53,956 --> 00:46:57,870
I just wear it when I'm working.
Gives a little protection with all the men.

648
00:46:58,002 --> 00:47:02,747
- Didn't work too well tonight, did it?
- No, tonight was bad.

649
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:05,123
But it's getting better.

650
00:47:08,846 --> 00:47:12,013
<i>- Where's the coffee?
- Ah, coffee, ja voll.</i>

651
00:47:12,141 --> 00:47:18,345
Finest Brazilian blend. The same brand
that Field Marshal Montgomery drinks.

652
00:47:35,081 --> 00:47:37,572
Is that a fair rate of exchange?

653
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:39,748
Very fair.

654
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:44,963
Would you be interested
in having the whole tin?

655
00:47:45,091 --> 00:47:47,130
I would.

656
00:47:56,143 --> 00:48:00,093
- How are you fixed for sugar?
- I could use some.

657
00:48:00,231 --> 00:48:01,974
Milk?

658
00:48:02,108 --> 00:48:03,935
Sure.

659
00:48:05,695 --> 00:48:07,937
Milk. Sugar.

660
00:48:09,115 --> 00:48:11,522
It's a pleasure to do business with you.

661
00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:13,486
Yeah.

662
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:22,580
I also carry biscuits, powdered eggs,

663
00:48:22,712 --> 00:48:27,255
- bacon, marmalade.
- I don't know if I can afford it.

664
00:48:27,383 --> 00:48:31,511
Don't worry, we'll work out something,
like an instalment plan.

665
00:48:31,637 --> 00:48:35,137
[ I may never go home any more ]

666
00:48:41,272 --> 00:48:44,273
I'm terribly sorry.
Now you have no ceiling.

667
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,315
- Maybe I can fix it, I'm good at it.
- Why fix it? It's not raining.

668
00:48:48,446 --> 00:48:49,774
Ooh.

669
00:48:49,906 --> 00:48:52,990
- Are you all right?
- I think so. My head aches a little.

670
00:48:53,117 --> 00:48:55,406
Maybe I can fix it.

671
00:48:55,536 --> 00:48:57,576
I'm good at it.

672
00:49:03,711 --> 00:49:06,629
I had a weekend pass,
a month's pay in my pocket.

673
00:49:06,756 --> 00:49:10,588
- And she already had a wedding ring.
- Yes, that's right.

674
00:49:10,718 --> 00:49:14,004
We got married. When I got out
of the service I brought her here.

675
00:49:14,139 --> 00:49:18,006
It was wonderful.
I rented a little flat, Edgware Road.

676
00:49:18,143 --> 00:49:21,642
First time she saw it, she was so happy
she broke down and cried.

677
00:49:21,771 --> 00:49:26,480
Naturally. She had a solid roof
over her head and a British passport.

678
00:49:26,609 --> 00:49:32,196
You don't know her, how she feels about
me. You will when she gives evidence.

679
00:49:32,323 --> 00:49:37,235
Mr Vole, I must tell you
I am not putting her in the witness box.

680
00:49:38,204 --> 00:49:40,197
You're not? Why not?

681
00:49:40,332 --> 00:49:44,080
She's a foreigner, unfamiliar
with the subtleties of our language.

682
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:46,618
The prosecution could easily trip her up.

683
00:49:46,755 --> 00:49:49,874
I hear it may be Mr Myers for the crown.
We can't take chances.

684
00:49:50,008 --> 00:49:54,219
Quite. We'd better be going. Miss Plimsoll
is waiting in the car with her pills

685
00:49:54,346 --> 00:49:57,845
- and a Thermos of lukewarm cocoa.
- Officer.

686
00:49:57,974 --> 00:50:02,636
- But Christine must give evidence.
- Mr Vole, you must learn to trust me.

687
00:50:02,771 --> 00:50:07,599
For no other reason than I'm a mean,
ill-tempered old man who hates to lose.

688
00:50:07,734 --> 00:50:10,403
Let us wish each other luck.

689
00:50:15,742 --> 00:50:21,531
Look, I can't face this without Christine.
I tell you, I need her. Without her I'm sunk.

690
00:50:22,874 --> 00:50:26,374
Touching, isn't it?
The way he counts on his wife.

691
00:50:26,503 --> 00:50:31,461
Yes. Like a drowning man
clutching at a razor blade.

692
00:50:46,815 --> 00:50:52,189
Leonard Stephen Vole, you are
charged on indictment for that you,

693
00:50:52,321 --> 00:50:56,449
on the 14th day of October,
in the county of London,

694
00:50:56,575 --> 00:50:59,492
murdered Emily Jane French.

695
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:02,324
How say you, Leonard Stephen Vole?

696
00:51:02,456 --> 00:51:05,540
Are you guilty or not guilty?

697
00:51:07,711 --> 00:51:09,170
Not guilty.

698
00:51:09,296 --> 00:51:11,004
<i>(murmuring)</i>

699
00:51:11,131 --> 00:51:13,254
Members of the jury,

700
00:51:13,383 --> 00:51:18,176
the prisoner stands indicted for that he,
on the 14th day of October,

701
00:51:18,305 --> 00:51:21,176
murdered Emily Jane French.

702
00:51:21,308 --> 00:51:25,057
To this indictment
he has pleaded not guilty.

703
00:51:25,187 --> 00:51:28,971
And it is your charge to say,
having heard the evidence,

704
00:51:29,108 --> 00:51:32,109
whether he be guilty or not.

705
00:51:36,365 --> 00:51:39,734
Members of the jury,
by the oath which you have just taken,

706
00:51:39,868 --> 00:51:43,403
you have sworn
to try this case on the evidence.

707
00:51:43,539 --> 00:51:46,160
You must shut out
from your minds everything

708
00:51:46,292 --> 00:51:49,874
except what will take place in this court.

709
00:51:50,004 --> 00:51:53,538
You may proceed
for the prosecution, Mr Myers.

710
00:51:53,674 --> 00:51:57,209
May it please you, my lord.
Members of the jury,

711
00:51:57,344 --> 00:52:02,090
I appear in this case with my learned
friend, Mr Barton, for the prosecution.

712
00:52:02,224 --> 00:52:06,139
And my learned friends
Sir Wilfrid Robarts and Mr Brogan-Moore

713
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:08,310
appear for the defence.

714
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:14,643
I trust we are not to be deprived

715
00:52:14,779 --> 00:52:17,696
of the learned and stimulating
presence of Sir Wilfrid?

716
00:52:17,823 --> 00:52:22,153
My lord, may I assure my learned friend
that Sir Wilfrid is in the Old Bailey.

717
00:52:22,286 --> 00:52:25,489
He's slightly incapacitated,
but will be in his seat presently.

718
00:52:25,623 --> 00:52:30,783
My lord, may I express my regret that
Sir Wilfrid is even slightly incapacitated.

719
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:36,341
You may, Mr Myers. You may also
proceed with the case for the prosecution.

720
00:52:36,467 --> 00:52:38,709
Thank you, my lord.

721
00:52:38,844 --> 00:52:42,794
The facts in this case are simple
and, to a point, not in dispute.

722
00:52:42,932 --> 00:52:47,060
You will hear how the prisoner made
the acquaintance of Mrs Emily French,

723
00:52:47,186 --> 00:52:48,764
a woman of 56.

724
00:52:48,896 --> 00:52:53,309
How he was treated by her
with kindness and even affection.

725
00:52:53,442 --> 00:52:56,016
On the night of October 14 last,

726
00:52:56,154 --> 00:53:00,151
between 9.30 and 10,
Mrs French was murdered.

727
00:53:01,242 --> 00:53:03,780
Medical testimony
will be introduced to prove

728
00:53:03,911 --> 00:53:07,245
that death was caused by a blow
from a blunt and heavy instrument,

729
00:53:07,373 --> 00:53:09,995
and it is the case for the prosecution

730
00:53:10,126 --> 00:53:13,329
that the blow was dealt
by the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

731
00:53:13,463 --> 00:53:15,502
That's not true! I didn't do it!

732
00:53:15,631 --> 00:53:16,580
<i>(murmuring)</i>

733
00:53:18,176 --> 00:53:20,927
Among the witnesses,
you will hear police evidence,

734
00:53:21,054 --> 00:53:24,886
also the evidence of Mrs French's
housekeeper, Janet McKenzie,

735
00:53:25,016 --> 00:53:27,803
and from the medical
and laboratory experts,

736
00:53:27,936 --> 00:53:33,606
and the evidence of the murdered
woman's solicitor, who drew her final will.

737
00:53:33,733 --> 00:53:37,517
I now call Chief Inspector Hearne,
Criminal Investigation Department,

738
00:53:37,654 --> 00:53:40,489
<i>- New Scotland Yard.
- (man) Chief Inspector Hearne.</i>

739
00:53:40,615 --> 00:53:43,699
- Chief Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector Hearne.

740
00:54:01,636 --> 00:54:06,298
This is ridiculous. Just nervous heartburn.
I always get it the first day of a trial.

741
00:54:06,433 --> 00:54:09,102
240 above 130.
You shouldn't be here at all.

742
00:54:09,227 --> 00:54:12,347
- I should be in court, the trial's begun.
- Syringe, please.

743
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,888
Be a good, brave boy, Sir Wilfrid.

744
00:54:15,025 --> 00:54:18,857
It may interest you to know
that I am descended from a warrior family

745
00:54:18,987 --> 00:54:24,361
which traces its brave past
back to Richard the Lion-Hearted.

746
00:54:26,745 --> 00:54:28,951
You're to have a calcium injection daily,

747
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:32,948
- tranquillising pill every hour.
- I'll set my wristwatch alarm.

748
00:54:33,084 --> 00:54:37,082
Any pain or shortness of breath,
pop one of these nitroglycerin tablets

749
00:54:37,214 --> 00:54:39,965
under your tongue.
Oh, and I'll leave you some...

750
00:54:40,091 --> 00:54:44,338
That's enough, Doctor.
The judge will be asking for a saliva test.

751
00:54:44,471 --> 00:54:49,049
Carter, I'd better take
that Thermos of cocoa with me.

752
00:54:49,184 --> 00:54:52,019
- Helps me wash down the pills.
- Let me see it, please.

753
00:54:52,145 --> 00:54:57,519
My learned patient is not above
substituting brandy for cocoa.

754
00:54:57,651 --> 00:55:00,189
It is cocoa. So sorry.

755
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,357
If you were a woman, Miss Plimsoll,
I would strike you.

756
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:06,159
Take care of this, Carter.

757
00:55:07,828 --> 00:55:11,493
Now, Sir Wilfrid, in the courtroom,
you must avoid overexcitement.

758
00:55:11,623 --> 00:55:13,034
Yes, Doctor, yes, yes.

759
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:15,871
Watch your temper.
Keep your blood pressure down.

760
00:55:16,003 --> 00:55:20,546
Thank you, Doctor, I shall be quite safe,
what with the pills and the cocoa.

761
00:55:20,674 --> 00:55:22,713
Come along, Carter.

762
00:55:23,885 --> 00:55:26,886
From the body temperature
and other factors,

763
00:55:27,014 --> 00:55:30,762
we placed the time of death
at between 9.30 and 10pm,

764
00:55:30,893 --> 00:55:36,397
approximately 30 minutes before Janet
McKenzie returned home and called us.

765
00:55:37,024 --> 00:55:42,647
Death was instantaneous, caused by one
blow from a heavy and blunt instrument.

766
00:55:42,779 --> 00:55:44,938
Were there any signs of a struggle?

767
00:55:45,073 --> 00:55:47,399
None. Just the one blow.

768
00:55:47,534 --> 00:55:51,484
Would that indicate that the murderer
had taken Mrs French by surprise?

769
00:55:51,622 --> 00:55:54,907
My lord, I must object.

770
00:55:55,751 --> 00:55:59,416
My learned friend refers
to the assailant as "the murderer".

771
00:55:59,546 --> 00:56:03,129
We have not yet determined whether
the assailant was a man or a woman.

772
00:56:03,258 --> 00:56:06,212
It could quite conceivably
have been "the murderess".

773
00:56:06,345 --> 00:56:12,300
Mr Myers, Sir Wilfrid has joined us just in
time to catch you on a point of grammar.

774
00:56:12,434 --> 00:56:14,593
Please rephrase your question.

775
00:56:14,728 --> 00:56:20,767
Yes, my lord. Inspector,
is it your opinion that the assailant,

776
00:56:20,901 --> 00:56:25,065
whether he, she or it,
had taken Mrs French by surprise?

777
00:56:25,197 --> 00:56:27,404
My lord, I am taken by surprise

778
00:56:27,533 --> 00:56:32,409
that my learned friend should try to solicit
from the witness an opinion, not a fact.

779
00:56:32,538 --> 00:56:35,455
Quite so. You'll have
to do better than that, Mr Myers.

780
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,908
My lord, I withdraw the question entirely.

781
00:56:38,043 --> 00:56:40,713
- Is that better?
- That's much better.

782
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:42,877
<i>(murmuring)</i>

783
00:56:46,552 --> 00:56:48,426
Silence! Silence!

784
00:56:48,554 --> 00:56:50,594
<i>(gavel)</i>

785
00:56:51,724 --> 00:56:54,641
Very well, Inspector,
let us proceed with the facts.

786
00:56:54,769 --> 00:56:59,181
After establishing the cause and the time
of death, what did you then do?

787
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:03,147
A search was made, photographs were
taken and the premises fingerprinted.

788
00:57:03,277 --> 00:57:07,441
- What fingerprints did you discover?
- I found the fingerprints of Mrs French,

789
00:57:07,573 --> 00:57:12,034
those of Janet McKenzie, and some which
later proved to be those of Leonard Vole.

790
00:57:12,161 --> 00:57:14,367
- No others?
- No others.

791
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:19,289
Did you say the room had the appearance
that a robbery had been committed?

792
00:57:19,418 --> 00:57:24,793
Yes. Things were strewn about and the
window had been broken near the catch.

793
00:57:24,924 --> 00:57:28,922
There was glass on the floor,
and fragments were found outside.

794
00:57:29,053 --> 00:57:34,510
The glass outside was not consistent with
the window being forced from the outside.

795
00:57:34,642 --> 00:57:41,356
You're saying that someone made it look
as if it had been forced from the outside?

796
00:57:41,482 --> 00:57:45,860
My lord, I must object. My learned friend
is putting words in the witness' mouth.

797
00:57:45,987 --> 00:57:48,904
After all, if he insists
on answering his own questions,

798
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:52,447
the presence of the witness
would seem superfluous.

799
00:57:52,577 --> 00:57:55,032
Quite. Don't you think so, Mr Myers?

800
00:57:55,163 --> 00:57:57,202
Yes, my lord.

801
00:57:58,333 --> 00:57:59,743
Inspector,

802
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:03,494
did you ascertain if any of the murdered
woman's property was missing?

803
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:06,714
According to the housekeeper,
nothing was missing.

804
00:58:06,841 --> 00:58:12,464
In your experience, Inspector,
when burglars or burglaresses

805
00:58:12,597 --> 00:58:16,511
break into a house,
do they leave without taking anything?

806
00:58:16,643 --> 00:58:17,757
No, sir.

807
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:20,811
- Do you produce a jacket, Inspector?
- Yes, sir.

808
00:58:20,939 --> 00:58:23,180
Is that the jacket?

809
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:30,234
- Yes, sir.
- That is exhibit P1, my lord.

810
00:58:30,365 --> 00:58:32,404
Where did you find this, Inspector?

811
00:58:32,534 --> 00:58:35,107
That is the jacket
found in the prisoner's flat,

812
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:37,736
which I handed to our lab
to test for bloodstains.

813
00:58:37,872 --> 00:58:40,328
- And did you find any bloodstains?
- Yes.

814
00:58:40,458 --> 00:58:43,032
Though an attempt
had been made to wash them out.

815
00:58:43,169 --> 00:58:45,043
What tests were made?

816
00:58:45,171 --> 00:58:49,383
First to determine
if the stains were human blood,

817
00:58:49,509 --> 00:58:51,917
then to classify it by group or type.

818
00:58:52,053 --> 00:58:54,723
And was the blood
of a particular group or type?

819
00:58:54,848 --> 00:58:57,765
Yes, sir. It is type O.

820
00:58:57,892 --> 00:59:01,178
And did you subsequently
test the blood of the dead woman?

821
00:59:01,313 --> 00:59:03,638
- Yes, sir.
- What type was that?

822
00:59:05,066 --> 00:59:07,474
<i>- The same. Type O.
- (murmuring)</i>

823
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:11,395
Thank you, Inspector.
No further questions.

824
00:59:11,531 --> 00:59:16,573
Inspector, you say the only fingerprints
you found were those of Mrs French,

825
00:59:16,703 --> 00:59:19,111
Janet McKenzie and Leonard Vole.

826
00:59:19,247 --> 00:59:24,205
In your experience, when a burglar breaks
in, does he usually leave fingerprints

827
00:59:24,336 --> 00:59:26,708
- or does he wear gloves?
- He wears gloves.

828
00:59:26,838 --> 00:59:29,163
So the absence
of fingerprints in a robbery

829
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:31,505
- would hardly surprise you?
- No, sir.

830
00:59:31,635 --> 00:59:35,632
Can't we surmise the burglar might have
entered a presumably empty house,

831
00:59:35,764 --> 00:59:38,469
suddenly encountered
Mrs French and struck her,

832
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,934
then, realising she was dead,
fled without taking anything?

833
00:59:42,062 --> 00:59:44,635
I submit, my lord,
that it is entirely impossible

834
00:59:44,773 --> 00:59:49,352
to guess what went on in the mind
of some entirely imaginary burglar.

835
00:59:49,486 --> 00:59:51,728
With or without gloves.

836
00:59:51,863 --> 00:59:55,778
Let us not surmise, Sir Wilfrid,
but confine ourselves to facts.

837
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:02,367
Inspector, when you questioned
the prisoner as to the stains on his jacket,

838
01:00:02,499 --> 01:00:06,544
did he not show you
a recently-healed scar on his wrist,

839
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:11,415
- saying he had cut himself slicing bread?
- Yes, sir, that is what he said.

840
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:14,302
And were you not told
the same thing by his wife?

841
01:00:14,428 --> 01:00:18,295
- Yes, sir. But afterwards...
- Just a simple yes or no, please.

842
01:00:18,432 --> 01:00:20,804
Did the prisoner's wife show you a knife

843
01:00:20,934 --> 01:00:24,979
and tell you that her husband
had cut his wrist while slicing bread?

844
01:00:25,105 --> 01:00:29,732
- Yes, sir.
- I will ask you to examine this knife.

845
01:00:33,947 --> 01:00:37,613
Just test the edge of it
with your finger. Carefully!

846
01:00:37,743 --> 01:00:41,741
You agree that the point
and the cutting edge are razor-sharp?

847
01:00:41,872 --> 01:00:44,328
- Yes, sir.
- Now, if such a knife were to slip,

848
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:47,494
might it not inflict a cut
that would bleed profusely?

849
01:00:47,628 --> 01:00:48,826
Yes, sir, it might.

850
01:00:48,963 --> 01:00:54,087
Inspector, you stated that the bloodstains
on the prisoner's jacket were analysed,

851
01:00:54,218 --> 01:00:59,176
as was the blood of Mrs French, and
they were both found to be of group O.

852
01:00:59,306 --> 01:01:01,762
- That is correct.
- However,

853
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:05,344
if the prisoner's blood
were also of this same group,

854
01:01:05,479 --> 01:01:08,184
then the stains on his jacket
may well have resulted

855
01:01:08,315 --> 01:01:11,020
from the household accident
he described to you.

856
01:01:11,152 --> 01:01:13,559
Yes, sir.

857
01:01:13,696 --> 01:01:17,480
Did you examine
the prisoner's blood, Inspector?

858
01:01:17,616 --> 01:01:19,159
No, sir.

859
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:23,740
I have here a certificate

860
01:01:23,873 --> 01:01:28,167
stating that Leonard Stephen Vole
is a blood donor

861
01:01:28,294 --> 01:01:30,583
at the North London Hospital.

862
01:01:30,713 --> 01:01:34,129
And that his blood is group O.

865
01:01:44,226 --> 01:01:48,935
Inspector, granted that the cut
on the wrist was caused by that knife,

866
01:01:49,065 --> 01:01:52,149
is there anything to show
whether it was an accident

867
01:01:52,276 --> 01:01:56,356
or done deliberately after the murder
to account for the bloodstains?

868
01:01:56,489 --> 01:01:59,276
- Oh, really, my lord!
- I withdraw the question.

869
01:01:59,408 --> 01:02:00,819
You may stand down.

01:02:45,163 --> 01:02:48,662
- Your name is Janet McKenzie?
- Aye, that's my name.

877
01:02:48,791 --> 01:02:53,786
- When did you first come to London?
- That was many years ago. 28 years ago.

878
01:02:53,922 --> 01:02:58,418
- Where do you live?
- Now that Mrs French, poor soul, is dead,

879
01:02:58,551 --> 01:03:02,300
I've moved in with my niece
at 19 Glenister Road.

880
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:05,680
You were companion-housekeeper
to the late Mrs Emily French?

881
01:03:05,809 --> 01:03:08,975
I was her housekeeper!
I've no opinion of companions,

882
01:03:09,103 --> 01:03:12,389
poor feckless bodies, afraid
of a bit of honest domestic work.

883
01:03:12,524 --> 01:03:17,731
I meant you were on friendly terms, not
altogether those of mistress and servant.

884
01:03:17,862 --> 01:03:20,982
Aye. Ten years I was with her
and looked after her.

885
01:03:21,116 --> 01:03:23,785
She knew me and she trusted me.

886
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:26,781
Many's the time
I prevented her doing a foolish thing.

887
01:03:26,913 --> 01:03:31,789
Please tell us, in your own words, about
the events of the evening of October 14.

888
01:03:32,502 --> 01:03:36,547
It was a Friday and my night out. I was
going to see my niece at Glenister Road,

889
01:03:36,673 --> 01:03:41,134
which is about five minutes' walk.
I left the house at half past seven.

890
01:03:41,261 --> 01:03:45,508
I promised to take her
a dress pattern that she admired.

891
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:49,258
- Och, is this thing necessary?
- An excellent question.

892
01:03:49,394 --> 01:03:53,807
However, it has been installed at
considerable expense to the taxpayers,

893
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:57,605
so let us take advantage of it.
Please continue.

894
01:03:57,736 --> 01:04:01,520
Well, when I got to my niece's,
I found I'd left the pattern behind.

895
01:04:01,656 --> 01:04:05,072
So after supper I slipped
back to get it as it was no distance.

896
01:04:05,202 --> 01:04:08,487
I got back to the house at 25 past 9.

897
01:04:08,622 --> 01:04:10,947
I let myself in
and went upstairs to my room.

898
01:04:11,083 --> 01:04:16,290
As I passed the sitting room, I heard the
prisoner in there, talking to Mrs French.

899
01:04:16,421 --> 01:04:20,549
<i>- No, it wasn't me! It wasn't my voice!
- (court murmurs)</i>

900
01:04:20,675 --> 01:04:22,715
Talking and laughing they were.

901
01:04:22,844 --> 01:04:26,379
But it was no business of mine,
so I went upstairs to fetch my pattern.

902
01:04:26,515 --> 01:04:29,931
Now, let us be very exact as to the time.

903
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:33,974
You say that you
re-entered the house at 25 past 9?

904
01:04:34,106 --> 01:04:38,518
Aye. The pattern was on a shelf in my
room next to my clock so I saw the time.

905
01:04:38,652 --> 01:04:43,113
- And it was 25 past 9.
- Go on, please.

906
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:49,243
I went back to my niece. Och,
she was delighted with the pattern. Si...

907
01:04:51,123 --> 01:04:57,457
Simply delighted. I stayed until 20 to 11,
then I said good night and I come home.

908
01:04:57,588 --> 01:05:01,372
I went into the sitting room to see
if the mistress wanted anything

909
01:05:01,508 --> 01:05:03,548
before she went to bed.

910
01:05:03,677 --> 01:05:08,220
And there she was, dead.
And everything tossed hither and thither.

911
01:05:08,348 --> 01:05:11,266
Did you really think
that a burglary had been committed?

912
01:05:11,393 --> 01:05:13,433
My lord, I must protest!

913
01:05:13,562 --> 01:05:17,726
I will not allow that question
to be answered, Mr Myers.

914
01:05:17,858 --> 01:05:21,772
Miss McKenzie, were you aware
that Leonard Vole was a married man?

915
01:05:21,904 --> 01:05:24,774
No, indeed.
And neither was the mistress.

916
01:05:24,907 --> 01:05:26,946
- Janet!
- My lord, I must object.

917
01:05:27,076 --> 01:05:32,034
What Mrs French knew or did not know is
pure conjecture on Janet McKenzie's part.

918
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:35,913
Let me put it this way.
You formed the opinion

919
01:05:36,043 --> 01:05:39,542
that Mrs French thought
Leonard Vole was a single man?

920
01:05:39,672 --> 01:05:43,171
- Have you any facts to support this?
- The books that she ordered.

921
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:48,176
A life of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts,
and the one about Disraeli and his wife.

922
01:05:48,305 --> 01:05:52,350
Both of them about women that married
men years younger than themselves. Oh!

923
01:05:52,476 --> 01:05:56,141
- I knew what she was thinking.
- I'm afraid we cannot admit that.

924
01:05:56,272 --> 01:05:58,893
<i>- Why?
- (laughter)</i>

925
01:05:59,024 --> 01:06:04,232
<i>Members of the jury, it is possible
for a woman to read The Life of Disraeli</i>

926
01:06:04,363 --> 01:06:08,491
without contemplating marriage
with a man younger than herself.

927
01:06:08,617 --> 01:06:10,776
<i>(laughter)</i>

928
01:06:10,911 --> 01:06:16,250
Were you aware of the arrangements Mrs
French made to dispose of her money?

929
01:06:16,375 --> 01:06:19,875
She had her old will revoked
and a new one drawn up.

930
01:06:20,004 --> 01:06:22,411
I heard her calling Mr Stokes,
her solicitor.

931
01:06:22,548 --> 01:06:25,502
He was there at the time.
The prisoner, I mean.

932
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:29,461
You heard Mrs French
and the prisoner discussing her new will?

933
01:06:29,597 --> 01:06:32,432
Yes. He was to have all her money,
she told him,

934
01:06:32,558 --> 01:06:36,971
as she had no near relations nor anybody
that meant to her what he did.

935
01:06:37,104 --> 01:06:40,520
- When did this take place?
- On October 8.

936
01:06:40,650 --> 01:06:43,935
One week to the day
before she was murdered.

937
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:47,320
Thank you.
That concludes my examination.

938
01:06:48,241 --> 01:06:50,910
Not just yet, Miss McKenzie.

939
01:06:51,994 --> 01:06:55,161
Would you...? Thank you.

940
01:06:55,289 --> 01:06:59,667
Miss McKenzie, you have
given evidence about two wills.

941
01:06:59,794 --> 01:07:01,833
In the old will, that which was revoked,

942
01:07:01,963 --> 01:07:05,795
were you not to receive
the bulk of Mrs French's estate?

943
01:07:05,925 --> 01:07:07,123
That's so.

944
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:11,554
Whereas in the new will, except for
a bequest to you of a small annuity,

945
01:07:11,681 --> 01:07:15,346
the principal beneficiary
is the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

946
01:07:15,476 --> 01:07:19,260
It'll be a wicked injustice
if he ever touches a penny of that money.

947
01:07:19,397 --> 01:07:23,726
It is entirely understandable
that you are antagonistic to the prisoner.

948
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:26,433
I'm not antagonistic to him.

949
01:07:26,571 --> 01:07:30,569
He's a shiftless, scheming rascal.
But I'm not antagonistic to him.

950
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:31,482
<i>(laughter)</i>

951
01:07:31,618 --> 01:07:33,657
I suggest you formed this opinion

952
01:07:33,786 --> 01:07:37,570
because his friendship with Mrs French
cost you the bulk of her estate.

953
01:07:37,707 --> 01:07:41,871
- I've never liked him.
- Your candour is refreshing.

954
01:07:42,003 --> 01:07:44,708
Now. On the night of October 14

955
01:07:44,839 --> 01:07:48,125
you say you heard the prisoner
and Mrs French talking together.

956
01:07:48,259 --> 01:07:51,711
- What did you hear them say?
- I didn't hear what they actually said.

957
01:07:51,846 --> 01:07:54,384
You mean you only heard the voices?

958
01:07:54,516 --> 01:07:57,351
- The murmur of voices?
- They were laughing.

959
01:07:57,477 --> 01:08:00,597
What makes you say
the man's voice was Leonard Vole's?

960
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:05,108
- I know his voice well enough.
- The door was closed, was it not?

961
01:08:05,235 --> 01:08:08,686
- Aye, that's so.
- You were in a hurry to get the pattern

962
01:08:08,822 --> 01:08:11,739
so you probably walked
quickly past the closed door,

963
01:08:11,866 --> 01:08:14,571
yet you are sure
you heard Leonard Vole's voice?

964
01:08:14,703 --> 01:08:17,490
I was there long enough
to hear what I heard.

965
01:08:17,622 --> 01:08:23,826
Come, I'm sure you don't wish to suggest
to the jury that you were eavesdropping.

966
01:08:23,962 --> 01:08:26,500
It was him in there.
Who else could it have been?

967
01:08:26,631 --> 01:08:30,925
What you mean is that you wanted it to
be him. That's the way your mind worked.

968
01:08:31,052 --> 01:08:35,133
Now, tell me, did Mrs French sometimes
watch television in the evening?

969
01:08:35,265 --> 01:08:38,266
Yes. She was fond
of a talk or a good play.

970
01:08:38,393 --> 01:08:41,643
Wasn't it possible when you
returned home and passed the door,

971
01:08:41,771 --> 01:08:43,930
what you really heard was the television

972
01:08:44,065 --> 01:08:46,639
and a man and woman's
voices and laughter?

973
01:08:46,777 --> 01:08:51,237
<i>There was a play called Lover's Leap
on the television that night.</i>

974
01:08:52,407 --> 01:08:56,820
- It was not the television.
- Oh, why not?

975
01:08:56,953 --> 01:09:01,995
Because the television was away
being repaired that week, that's why.

976
01:09:02,125 --> 01:09:03,833
<i>(laughter)</i>

977
01:09:09,591 --> 01:09:11,631
<i>(gavel)</i>

978
01:09:12,636 --> 01:09:14,510
Silence! Silence!

979
01:09:16,223 --> 01:09:19,343
Odd. It's not time yet.

980
01:09:19,476 --> 01:09:22,512
If my learned friend has no further
questions, I'd like...

981
01:09:22,646 --> 01:09:25,730
I have not quite finished.

982
01:09:25,857 --> 01:09:30,484
You are registered, are you not,
under the National Health Insurance Act?

983
01:09:30,612 --> 01:09:34,361
Aye, that's so.
Four and sixpence I pay out every week.

984
01:09:34,491 --> 01:09:37,528
That's a terrible lot of money
for a working woman to pay.

985
01:09:37,661 --> 01:09:40,579
I am sure that many agree with you.

986
01:09:40,706 --> 01:09:47,124
Miss McKenzie, did you recently apply
to the National Health Insurance for...

987
01:09:47,254 --> 01:09:50,872
<i>- (quietly)... a hearing aid?
- For... for what?</i>

988
01:09:51,008 --> 01:09:54,009
I protest against the way
in which this question was put!

989
01:09:54,136 --> 01:09:57,220
I will repeat the question, my lord.

990
01:09:57,348 --> 01:10:03,302
I asked you in a normal tone of voice,
audible to everyone in open court,

991
01:10:03,437 --> 01:10:08,313
did you apply to the National Health
Insurance for a hearing aid?

992
01:10:08,442 --> 01:10:09,473
Yes, I did.

993
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:12,017
- Did you get it?
- Not yet.

994
01:10:12,154 --> 01:10:17,445
However, you state that you walked past
a door, which is four inches of solid oak,

995
01:10:17,576 --> 01:10:20,779
you heard voices,
and you are willing to swear

996
01:10:20,913 --> 01:10:23,997
that you could distinguish the voice of...

997
01:10:24,124 --> 01:10:26,331
<i>(quietly)... the prisoner, Leonard Vole.</i>

998
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:28,500
Who? Who?

999
01:10:28,629 --> 01:10:29,578
<i>(murmuring)</i>

1000
01:10:29,713 --> 01:10:31,753
No further questions.

1001
01:10:34,135 --> 01:10:36,507
Och, maybe you could help me,
Your Lordship.

1002
01:10:36,637 --> 01:10:40,717
Six months ago I applied for
my hearing aid, and I'm still waiting for it.

1003
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:45,808
My dear Miss McKenzie, considering
the rubbish that is being talked nowadays,

1004
01:10:45,938 --> 01:10:48,892
you are missing very little.
You may stand down now.

1005
01:10:49,024 --> 01:10:51,432
<i>(laughter)</i>

1006
01:10:51,569 --> 01:10:54,819
<i>(Myers) Call Police Constable Jeffries.</i>

1007
01:10:54,947 --> 01:10:59,241
- Police Constable Jeffries.
- Police Constable Jeffries.

1008
01:11:09,795 --> 01:11:12,631
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I shall give

1009
01:11:12,757 --> 01:11:17,834
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

1010
01:11:31,108 --> 01:11:33,979
Mr Myers, does that conclude your case?

1011
01:11:34,112 --> 01:11:39,106
No, my lord. I now call the final witness
for the prosecution, Christine Helm.

1012
01:11:39,617 --> 01:11:43,033
- Christine Helm!
- Christine Helm.

1013
01:11:54,674 --> 01:11:56,713
Christine.

1014
01:12:07,562 --> 01:12:10,267
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I shall give

1015
01:12:10,398 --> 01:12:14,016
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

1016
01:12:14,152 --> 01:12:16,773
My lord, I have the most serious objection

1017
01:12:16,905 --> 01:12:20,985
to this witness being summoned,
as she is the wife of the prisoner.

1018
01:12:21,117 --> 01:12:23,193
I call my learned friend's attention

1019
01:12:23,328 --> 01:12:27,871
to the fact that I summoned
not Mrs Vole, but Mrs Helm.

1020
01:12:27,999 --> 01:12:32,079
- Your name, in fact, is Christine Helm?
- Yes. Christine Helm.

1021
01:12:32,212 --> 01:12:35,830
And you have been living
as the wife of the prisoner, Leonard Vole?

1022
01:12:35,965 --> 01:12:38,635
- Yes.
- Are you actually his wife?

1023
01:12:39,177 --> 01:12:40,719
No.

1024
01:12:40,845 --> 01:12:45,342
I went through a marriage ceremony
with him, but I already had a husband.

1025
01:12:45,475 --> 01:12:48,096
- He's still alive.
- Christine, that's not true!

1026
01:12:48,228 --> 01:12:51,679
There is proof of a marriage
between the witness and the prisoner,

1027
01:12:51,815 --> 01:12:54,769
but is there any proof
of a so-called previous marriage?

1028
01:12:54,901 --> 01:13:00,524
My lord, the so-called previous marriage
is, in fact, well-documented.

1029
01:13:00,657 --> 01:13:06,660
Mrs Helm, is this a certificate of marriage
between yourself and Otto Ludwig Helm,

1030
01:13:06,788 --> 01:13:11,497
the ceremony having taken place
in Breslau on 18 April 1942?

1031
01:13:11,626 --> 01:13:14,461
Yes, that is the paper of my marriage.

1032
01:13:14,588 --> 01:13:20,507
I don't see any reason why this witness
should not be qualified to give evidence.

1033
01:13:24,723 --> 01:13:29,266
You're willing to give evidence against the
man you've been calling your husband?

1034
01:13:29,394 --> 01:13:30,853
Yes.

1035
01:13:31,521 --> 01:13:35,270
You stated to the police that on the night
that Mrs French was murdered,

1036
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:40,643
Leonard Vole left the house at 7.30
and returned at 25 minutes past 9.

1037
01:13:40,781 --> 01:13:43,402
Did he, in fact, return at 25 past 9?

1038
01:13:45,077 --> 01:13:48,243
No. He returned at ten minutes past ten.

1039
01:13:48,372 --> 01:13:53,034
Christine, what are you saying?
It's not true. You know it's not true!

1040
01:13:53,168 --> 01:13:54,627
<i>(murmuring)</i>

1041
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:58,753
Silence!

1042
01:13:58,882 --> 01:14:00,922
I must have silence.

1043
01:14:02,344 --> 01:14:05,345
As your counsel will tell you,
Vole, you will very shortly

1044
01:14:05,472 --> 01:14:08,426
have an opportunity of
speaking in your own defence.

1045
01:14:08,559 --> 01:14:12,687
Leonard Vole returned, you say,
at ten minutes past ten.

1046
01:14:12,813 --> 01:14:16,348
- And what happened next?
- He was breathing hard, very excited.

1047
01:14:16,483 --> 01:14:19,188
He threw off his coat
and examined the sleeves.

1048
01:14:19,319 --> 01:14:21,526
Then he told me to wash the cuffs.

1049
01:14:21,655 --> 01:14:23,813
- They had blood on them.
- Go on.

1050
01:14:23,949 --> 01:14:26,950
- I said "What have you done?"
- What did the prisoner say?

1051
01:14:27,077 --> 01:14:29,319
He said "I've killed her."

1052
01:14:29,455 --> 01:14:33,951
Christine! Why are you lying?
Why are you saying these things?

1053
01:14:34,084 --> 01:14:38,248
- What an awful woman.
- She's evil. I've known it all along.

1054
01:14:41,508 --> 01:14:44,960
If the defence so desires,
I will adjourn for a short time

1055
01:14:45,095 --> 01:14:48,262
so that the prisoner
may gain control of himself.

1056
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:52,139
My lord is most gracious,
but pray let the witness continue.

1057
01:14:52,269 --> 01:14:56,516
We are all of us caught up
in the suspense of this horror fiction.

1058
01:14:56,649 --> 01:15:00,516
To have to hear it in instalments
might prove unendurable.

1059
01:15:00,653 --> 01:15:03,570
- Proceed, Mr Myers.
- Mrs Helm,

1060
01:15:03,697 --> 01:15:08,490
when the prisoner said "I have killed her",
did you know to whom he referred?

1061
01:15:08,619 --> 01:15:11,454
It was that woman
he had been seeing so often.

1062
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:16,326
When questioned by the police, you told
them that the prisoner returned at 9.25.

1063
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:18,832
Yes. Because Leonard
asked me to say that.

1064
01:15:18,963 --> 01:15:21,039
But you've changed your story now. Why?

1065
01:15:21,173 --> 01:15:23,380
I cannot go on lying to save him.

1066
01:15:23,509 --> 01:15:26,843
I said to the police what he wanted
because I'm grateful to him.

1067
01:15:26,971 --> 01:15:29,722
He married me
and brought me to this country.

1068
01:15:29,849 --> 01:15:32,885
What he has asked me to do I have
because I was grateful.

1069
01:15:33,019 --> 01:15:36,055
It was not because
he was your husband and you loved him?

1070
01:15:36,188 --> 01:15:38,228
I never loved him.

1071
01:15:38,733 --> 01:15:41,899
It was gratitude, then,
that prompted you to give him an alibi

1072
01:15:42,028 --> 01:15:45,527
- in your statement to the police?
- That is it. Exactly.

1073
01:15:45,656 --> 01:15:49,191
- But now you think it was wrong to do so.
- Because it is murder.

1074
01:15:49,327 --> 01:15:51,450
That woman, she was a harmless old fool,

1075
01:15:51,579 --> 01:15:54,117
and he makes of me
an accomplice to the murder.

1076
01:15:54,248 --> 01:15:58,246
I cannot come into court and swear that
he was with me at the time it was done.

1077
01:15:58,377 --> 01:16:01,047
I cannot do it! I cannot do it!

1078
01:16:01,172 --> 01:16:03,414
Then this is the truth?

1079
01:16:03,549 --> 01:16:07,084
That Leonard Vole returned
that night at ten minutes past ten,

1080
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:09,296
he had blood on the sleeves of his coat,

1081
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:13,558
and that he said to you
"I have killed her"?

1082
01:16:15,228 --> 01:16:16,971
That is the truth.

1083
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:20,271
That is the truth, before God?

1084
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,522
That is the truth.

1085
01:16:23,027 --> 01:16:25,067
Thank you.

1086
01:16:30,284 --> 01:16:33,819
Mrs Vole, or Mrs Helm,
which do you prefer to be called?

1087
01:16:33,955 --> 01:16:35,994
- It does not matter.
- Does it not?

1088
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:40,168
In this country we are inclined to take
a rather more serious view of marriage.

1089
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:45,502
However, it would appear that when
you first met the prisoner in Hamburg

1090
01:16:45,633 --> 01:16:50,129
- you lied to him about your marital status.
- I wanted to get out of Germany, so...

1091
01:16:50,263 --> 01:16:53,347
You lied, did you not?
Just yes or no, please.

1092
01:16:53,474 --> 01:16:55,514
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1093
01:16:55,643 --> 01:16:58,728
And in arranging the marriage,
you lied to the authorities?

1094
01:16:58,855 --> 01:17:01,772
I, um, did not tell the truth
to the authorities.

1095
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:04,141
- You lied to them?
- Yes.

1096
01:17:04,277 --> 01:17:08,654
And in the ceremony, when you swore
to love, honour and cherish your husband,

1097
01:17:08,782 --> 01:17:11,273
- that too was a lie?
- Yes.

1098
01:17:11,409 --> 01:17:14,659
And when the police questioned you
about this wretched man

1099
01:17:14,788 --> 01:17:17,195
who believed himself married and loved,

1100
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:19,823
- you told them...
- I told them what he wanted me to.

1101
01:17:19,959 --> 01:17:23,791
You told them that he was at home
with you at 25 minutes past 9,

1102
01:17:23,922 --> 01:17:28,216
- and now you say that that was a lie?
- Yes, a lie!

1103
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:32,720
And when you said that he had
accidentally cut his wrist, again, you lied?

1104
01:17:32,847 --> 01:17:37,723
- Yes!
- And today you told a new story entirely.

1105
01:17:37,852 --> 01:17:41,387
The question is, Frau Helm,
were you lying then, are you lying now?

1106
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:45,271
Or are you not, in fact,
a chronic and habitual liar?!

1107
01:17:45,402 --> 01:17:47,893
<i>(murmuring)</i>

1108
01:17:48,029 --> 01:17:48,811
<i>(coughs)</i>

1109
01:17:48,947 --> 01:17:53,276
Carter, Carter!
The other pill. Under the tongue.

1110
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:57,739
My lord, is my learned friend to be
allowed to bully and insult the witness?

1111
01:17:57,873 --> 01:18:02,084
Mr Myers, this is a capital charge
and, within the bounds of reason,

1112
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:06,338
I should like the defence
to have every latitude.

1113
01:18:09,509 --> 01:18:12,083
My lord, may I also
remind my learned friend

1114
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:16,135
that his witness, by her own admission,
has already violated so many oaths

1115
01:18:16,266 --> 01:18:20,180
that I am surprised the Testament
did not leap from her hand

1116
01:18:20,312 --> 01:18:22,981
when she was sworn here today.

1117
01:18:23,106 --> 01:18:27,400
I doubt if anything is to be gained
by questioning you any further.

1118
01:18:27,527 --> 01:18:29,650
That will be all, Frau Helm.

1119
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:31,819
<i>(muttering)</i>

1120
01:18:34,618 --> 01:18:39,079
Mrs Helm, I presume you know the
meaning of the English word "perjury"?

1121
01:18:39,206 --> 01:18:42,824
<i>- In German, the word is Meineid.
- Yes. Meineid.</i>

1122
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,036
It means to swear falsely under oath.

1123
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:46,962
And are you aware, Mrs Helm,

1124
01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:52,047
that the penalty in this country for perjury
is a heavy term of imprisonment?

1125
01:18:52,177 --> 01:18:54,633
Yes, I'm aware.

1126
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:59,509
Mindful of this fact, I ask you once more,
is the evidence that you have given

1127
01:18:59,643 --> 01:19:03,261
the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1128
01:19:03,397 --> 01:19:05,354
So help me, God.

1129
01:19:06,525 --> 01:19:10,938
Then that, my lord,
is the case for the prosecution.

1130
01:19:28,714 --> 01:19:32,546
- Want a tissue?
- Yes, thanks.

1131
01:19:32,676 --> 01:19:37,385
It's the first murder trial
I've ever been to. It's terrible.

1132
01:19:37,514 --> 01:19:38,463
Silence.

1133
01:19:40,726 --> 01:19:44,427
Sir Wilfrid.
Are you ready for the defence?

1134
01:19:46,607 --> 01:19:50,391
My lord, members of the jury,

1135
01:19:50,528 --> 01:19:55,688
the prosecution has very ably presented
against the prisoner, Leonard Vole,

1136
01:19:55,825 --> 01:20:00,202
a case with the most overwhelming
circumstantial evidence.

1137
01:20:00,329 --> 01:20:03,864
Among the witnesses you have heard
Chief Inspector Hearne,

1138
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:09,076
who has given his testimony in a fair
and impartial manner, as he always does.

1139
01:20:09,213 --> 01:20:14,124
He has put before you a clever theory
of how this crime was committed.

1140
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:18,210
Whether it is theory
or actual fact, however,

1141
01:20:18,347 --> 01:20:20,885
you will decide for yourselves.

1142
01:20:21,934 --> 01:20:25,054
And then you have heard
the evidence of Janet McKenzie,

1143
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:29,351
a worthy and devoted housekeeper who
has suffered two most grievous losses.

1144
01:20:29,483 --> 01:20:31,809
One, the death of her beloved mistress

1145
01:20:31,944 --> 01:20:37,615
and, second, in being deprived
of an inheritance of? 80,000,

1146
01:20:37,742 --> 01:20:40,529
which she'd fully expected to receive.

1147
01:20:40,661 --> 01:20:44,493
I will not comment
further on her evidence,

1148
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:49,539
but will express only
my deepest sympathy for her

1149
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:52,541
in both these... mishaps.

1150
01:20:53,508 --> 01:20:59,213
And most damaging of all, the prosecution
has produced a surprise witness,

1151
01:20:59,347 --> 01:21:04,009
one Christine Helm, whom the prisoner
brought from the rubble of her homeland

1152
01:21:04,143 --> 01:21:08,852
to the safety of this country, giving her
his love and the protection of his name.

1153
01:21:08,981 --> 01:21:12,730
I objected to her testimony
because a wife cannot give evidence

1154
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:15,351
<i>harmful to her husband.</i>

1155
01:21:15,488 --> 01:21:22,155
But it has been proven that her marriage
to Mr Vole was fraudulent and bigamous.

1156
01:21:22,287 --> 01:21:28,455
Therefore, her evidence must be admitted
and you must consider it.

1157
01:21:28,585 --> 01:21:31,455
For what it is worth.

1158
01:21:33,089 --> 01:21:37,502
Such is the prosecution's case.
Now it is the turn of the defence.

1159
01:21:37,635 --> 01:21:41,715
We could present, on behalf of
the prisoner, witnesses to his character,

1160
01:21:41,848 --> 01:21:45,798
his war record, the lack of criminal
or evil association in his past.

1161
01:21:45,935 --> 01:21:51,641
However, only one witness
can shed new light

1162
01:21:51,775 --> 01:21:54,645
on this tragic riddle.

1163
01:21:55,737 --> 01:21:57,776
The prisoner himself.

1164
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,399
Members of the jury,

1165
01:22:01,534 --> 01:22:05,117
I call Leonard Stephen Vole.

1166
01:22:24,391 --> 01:22:27,724
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I give will be the truth,

1167
01:22:27,852 --> 01:22:31,019
- the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
- No.

1168
01:22:32,232 --> 01:22:36,395
- Is your name Leonard Stephen Vole?
- It is.

1169
01:22:36,528 --> 01:22:39,612
- Where do live?
- 620 Edgware Road.

1170
01:22:39,739 --> 01:22:45,030
Leonard Stephen Vole, did you or did
you not on the night of October 14 last,

1171
01:22:45,162 --> 01:22:47,403
murder Emily Jane French?

1172
01:22:47,998 --> 01:22:51,912
- I did not.
- Thank you, that will be all.

1173
01:22:52,044 --> 01:22:53,953
<i>(muttering)</i>

1174
01:22:54,087 --> 01:22:58,548
Have you, in fact, concluded your
examination of the prisoner, Sir Wilfrid?

1175
01:22:58,675 --> 01:23:03,966
The prisoner has endured three days
of profound mental agony and shock.

1176
01:23:04,097 --> 01:23:06,588
The defence feels
his faculties should be spared

1177
01:23:06,725 --> 01:23:10,308
for the cross-examination
by my learned friend for the prosecution.

1178
01:23:10,437 --> 01:23:13,308
This is not a plea for any indulgence.

1179
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:16,476
I am confident that
no matter how searching this may be,

1180
01:23:16,610 --> 01:23:19,480
the prisoner will withstand it.

1181
01:23:20,989 --> 01:23:24,654
At the time you made the acquaintance
of Mrs French, were you employed?

1182
01:23:24,785 --> 01:23:26,824
- No, sir.
- How much money did you have?

1183
01:23:26,954 --> 01:23:29,030
- A few pounds.
- Did she give you any?

1184
01:23:29,164 --> 01:23:29,946
No.

1185
01:23:30,082 --> 01:23:32,288
- Did you expect to receive any?
- No, sir.

1186
01:23:32,417 --> 01:23:37,329
Did you know that in her new will,
you were the beneficiary of? 80,000?

1187
01:23:37,464 --> 01:23:38,662
No, I didn't.

1188
01:23:38,799 --> 01:23:43,675
Now, Mr Vole, when you went to visit
Mrs French for the last time,

1189
01:23:43,804 --> 01:23:47,090
did you wear a trench coat
and a brown hat?

1190
01:23:48,058 --> 01:23:51,723
- Yes, I did.
- Was it this coat and hat?

1191
01:23:53,397 --> 01:23:54,393
Yes, sir.

1192
01:23:54,523 --> 01:23:59,730
My lord, the defence, in its efforts
to establish an alibi for the prisoner,

1193
01:23:59,862 --> 01:24:03,112
circulated this photograph,
hoping to bring forth a witness

1194
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:06,443
who had seen him leaving
Mrs French's house or entering his own

1195
01:24:06,577 --> 01:24:09,150
at the times that he has stated.

1196
01:24:09,288 --> 01:24:12,739
Apparently, this splendid effort
was without results.

1197
01:24:12,875 --> 01:24:15,247
However, the defence
will be pleased to learn

1198
01:24:15,377 --> 01:24:18,581
that, at the last moment,
a witness has come forward,

1199
01:24:18,714 --> 01:24:23,376
and that the prisoner had been
seen wearing this coat and this hat.

1200
01:24:23,511 --> 01:24:28,932
Lamentably, he had not been seen on the
night of the murder but one week before.

1201
01:24:29,058 --> 01:24:33,352
On the afternoon of October 8, were you
not in a travel agency in Regent Street?

1202
01:24:33,479 --> 01:24:37,524
And did you not make inquiries about
prices and schedules of foreign cruises?

1203
01:24:37,650 --> 01:24:40,935
Supposing I did? It's not a crime, is it?

1204
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:45,198
Not at all. Many people go on a cruise
when they can afford to pay for it.

1205
01:24:45,324 --> 01:24:50,366
- But you couldn't pay for it, could you?
- Well, I was hard up. I told you that.

1206
01:24:50,496 --> 01:24:55,739
And yet you came to this particular
travel agency with a clinging brunette?

1207
01:24:55,876 --> 01:24:58,284
A clinging brunette, Mr Myers?

1208
01:24:59,088 --> 01:25:01,164
My lord, the lady was so described to me.

1209
01:25:01,299 --> 01:25:05,759
She was very affectionate with the
prisoner, constantly clinging to his arm.

1210
01:25:05,886 --> 01:25:07,844
Oh.

1211
01:25:08,598 --> 01:25:13,176
You then admit that you made inquiries
about expensive and luxurious cruises?

1212
01:25:13,311 --> 01:25:15,469
How did you expect
to pay for such a thing?

1213
01:25:15,605 --> 01:25:18,855
- I don't know. It was...
- If you don't know, perhaps I can help.

1214
01:25:18,983 --> 01:25:23,360
On the morning of the very same day,
you heard Mrs French change her will,

1215
01:25:23,488 --> 01:25:25,860
- leaving you the bulk of her money.
- I didn't!

1216
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:29,074
And in the afternoon,
you started plans to dispose of it.

1217
01:25:29,202 --> 01:25:31,408
No! It was nothing of the kind.

1218
01:25:31,537 --> 01:25:34,704
I was in a pub and I met a girl.
I don't even remember her name.

1219
01:25:34,832 --> 01:25:36,955
We had a drink and walked out together.

1220
01:25:37,085 --> 01:25:43,123
We passed the window and saw the fancy
posters, all blue seas and palm trees.

1221
01:25:43,257 --> 01:25:48,548
The Grecian isles or somewhere. We went
in for fun and I started asking for folders.

1222
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:52,547
Well, the man gave me a funny look
because I did look a bit shabby.

1223
01:25:52,684 --> 01:25:56,099
Anyway, it irritated me,
so I kept asking for the swankiest tours,

1224
01:25:56,229 --> 01:25:59,728
all de luxe and cabin on the boat deck,
but it was just an act!

1225
01:25:59,857 --> 01:26:04,021
An act? You knew that in a week
you were going to inherit? 80,000!

1226
01:26:04,153 --> 01:26:08,697
No! It wasn't that way at all.
It was make-believe and childish but...

1227
01:26:08,825 --> 01:26:13,238
it was fun and I enjoyed it. I never thought
of killing anyone or inheriting any money.

1228
01:26:13,371 --> 01:26:17,321
It's just a coincidence that Mrs French
should be killed only one week later?

1229
01:26:17,458 --> 01:26:19,914
I told you! I didn't kill her!

1230
01:26:20,545 --> 01:26:24,625
Do you know any reason why Christine
Helm should give the evidence she has

1231
01:26:24,757 --> 01:26:28,589
- if it were not true?
- No. I don't know why my wife...

1232
01:26:29,304 --> 01:26:34,547
I don't know why I still call her my wife.
She must be lying or out of her mind.

1233
01:26:34,684 --> 01:26:37,306
She seemed remarkably
sane and self-possessed.

1234
01:26:37,437 --> 01:26:41,933
- But insanity is all you can suggest?
- I don't understand it.

1235
01:26:42,067 --> 01:26:44,605
Oh, God! What's happened?
What's changed her?

1236
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:48,816
Very effective, I'm sure.
But in this court we deal with fact.

1237
01:26:48,948 --> 01:26:51,866
And the fact, Mr Vole,
is that we've only your word for it.

1238
01:26:51,993 --> 01:26:54,911
That you left Mrs French's house
at the time you say,

1239
01:26:55,038 --> 01:26:59,830
that you came home at 5 and 20 minutes
past 9, and that you did not go out again!

1240
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:03,126
Somebody must have seen me
in the street or going in the house!

1241
01:27:03,255 --> 01:27:07,632
One would think so. But the only person
who did see you come home that night

1242
01:27:07,759 --> 01:27:11,045
says it was ten past ten
and that you had blood on your hands.

1243
01:27:11,179 --> 01:27:14,180
- I cut my wrist!
- You cut your wrist deliberately!

1244
01:27:14,307 --> 01:27:16,347
No, I didn't! I didn't do anything.

1245
01:27:16,476 --> 01:27:19,394
But you make it sound as though I did.
I can hear it myself.

1246
01:27:19,521 --> 01:27:21,727
You came home at ten past ten!

1247
01:27:21,857 --> 01:27:26,234
No, I didn't! You've got to believe me.
You've got to believe me!

1248
01:27:26,361 --> 01:27:28,568
You killed Emily French!

1249
01:27:28,697 --> 01:27:31,022
No, I didn't! I didn't do it!

1250
01:27:31,158 --> 01:27:35,025
I didn't kill her! I never killed anybody!

1251
01:27:35,162 --> 01:27:39,740
God, it's like a nightmare.
Some ghastly, horrible dream.

1252
01:27:45,422 --> 01:27:47,878
Good evening, Sir Wilfrid.
How did it go today?

1253
01:27:48,008 --> 01:27:50,250
Oh, Sir Wilfrid.

1254
01:27:50,385 --> 01:27:55,724
I'm from Hawks and Hill, sir, and I've
brought your Bermuda shorts for a fitting.

1255
01:27:56,767 --> 01:27:57,763
What?

1256
01:27:57,893 --> 01:28:02,436
- You'd better slip these on, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'm in the middle of a murder trial.

1257
01:28:02,564 --> 01:28:06,609
It'll all be over by the afternoon,
and the boat train doesn't go until 9.40.

1258
01:28:06,735 --> 01:28:10,151
You work it out. You know my shape,
you've stabbed it often enough.

1259
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:14,823
Upstairs. You need a lukewarm bath
and your calcium injection.

1260
01:28:14,952 --> 01:28:17,906
And there's a lot more packing to be done.

1261
01:28:18,872 --> 01:28:23,700
It's ridiculous having boat reservations.
The jury may be out for days.

1262
01:28:23,836 --> 01:28:28,165
Not on this case, I'm afraid.
It seems too open-and-shut.

1263
01:28:30,217 --> 01:28:33,835
I watched when Frau Helm
was on the stand. They didn't like her.

1264
01:28:33,971 --> 01:28:38,218
No, but they believed her. They liked
Leonard Vole but they didn't believe him.

1265
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:41,600
And that travel agency business
doesn't help either. Cigar?

1266
01:28:41,729 --> 01:28:42,559
No.

1267
01:28:42,688 --> 01:28:45,475
- Wilfrid, do you think she lied?
- Well, don't you?

1268
01:28:45,608 --> 01:28:46,936
I'm not sure.

1269
01:28:47,067 --> 01:28:50,816
<i>I am. She lied. Whether she calls it
Meineid or perjury, she lied.</i>

1270
01:28:50,946 --> 01:28:55,988
The only question is why. What's
her game? What is she up to? What?

1271
01:28:56,577 --> 01:29:01,737
I hope that in your final speech you
won't become too emotionally involved.

1272
01:29:01,874 --> 01:29:04,791
- You must think of your condition.
- He's right.

1273
01:29:04,919 --> 01:29:08,453
I want to see you save yourself.
This isn't going to be your last case.

1274
01:29:08,589 --> 01:29:12,338
Yes, it is. But until it's over,
I'm still a barrister.

1275
01:29:12,468 --> 01:29:16,300
My client's life is at stake.
That's all that matters - his life.

1276
01:29:16,430 --> 01:29:19,301
He's entitled to the best that I can do.

1277
01:29:19,433 --> 01:29:23,478
If I can't stand up to make my final appeal
for him, I'll make it sitting down.

1278
01:29:23,604 --> 01:29:27,933
If I become short of breath I'll take a pill,
or two pills, or all of them and the box too.

1279
01:29:28,067 --> 01:29:30,558
<i>(telephone rings)</i>

1280
01:29:35,825 --> 01:29:38,909
<i>- Yes?
- (woman) This Sir Wilfrid Robarts' place?</i>

1281
01:29:39,036 --> 01:29:42,452
<i>- Well, yes, it is.
- Let me talk to the old geezer.</i>

1282
01:29:42,581 --> 01:29:46,959
<i>- Who is this speaking, please?
- Never you mind. Let me talk to 'im.</i>

1283
01:29:47,086 --> 01:29:50,621
I'm afraid that's impossible.
What is the nature of your business?

1284
01:29:50,756 --> 01:29:54,042
It's business all right.
I've got something to sell 'im, I 'ave.

1285
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:55,421
<i>Well, really, madam!</i>

1286
01:29:55,553 --> 01:29:58,554
And what I want to sell 'im,
believe me, 'e'll want to buy.

1287
01:29:58,681 --> 01:30:02,382
- It's got to do with that Leonard Vole.
- Leonard Vole?

1288
01:30:02,518 --> 01:30:04,760
<i>It's about that German wife.</i>

1289
01:30:04,896 --> 01:30:08,430
<i>I've got the goods on her and it's for sale.</i>

1290
01:30:10,234 --> 01:30:14,149
This is Wilfrid Robarts speaking.
Now, what is this all about?

1291
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:16,605
<i>Well, hello, ducky.</i>

1292
01:30:16,741 --> 01:30:19,658
What is this you said
about Mrs Leonard Vole?

1293
01:30:19,786 --> 01:30:23,653
<i>I'm not just saying.
I've got it in black and white.</i>

1294
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:26,744
- You've got what?
- Listen to this carefully, ducks.

1295
01:30:26,876 --> 01:30:30,375
I'm at the buffet at Euston Station
at the far end of the bar.

1296
01:30:30,505 --> 01:30:33,921
I'll be here for 30 minutes
because that's when me train leaves.

1297
01:30:34,050 --> 01:30:37,336
If you want the lowdown on
that German bag, get yourself here.

1298
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:40,008
What lowdown?
What do you know about her?

1299
01:30:40,139 --> 01:30:42,298
Uh-uh. Not on the phone.

1300
01:30:42,433 --> 01:30:46,680
You'd better get on over here,
and bring plenty of money.

1301
01:30:47,313 --> 01:30:50,647
Now, just a moment! Hello? Hello?

1302
01:30:52,527 --> 01:30:58,316
That's... bilge. Some drunken crank.
You get those in every murder trial.

1303
01:30:58,449 --> 01:31:02,993
Giving me an ultimatum, Euston Station in
30 minutes. Got the lowdown on Mrs Vole.

1304
01:31:03,121 --> 01:31:04,948
Balderdash.

1305
01:31:05,081 --> 01:31:10,538
I'm too old and too sick
to go on a wild-goose chase.

1306
01:31:10,670 --> 01:31:13,541
- Come on, Mayhew.
- Where to, Sir Wilfrid?

1307
01:31:13,673 --> 01:31:16,757
Euston Station, where do you think?

1308
01:31:18,386 --> 01:31:20,379
Now, sir?

1309
01:31:20,513 --> 01:31:22,340
Shortly.

1310
01:31:23,266 --> 01:31:24,808
Cigar!

1311
01:31:25,727 --> 01:31:27,766
Sir Wilfrid, where are you going?

1312
01:31:27,896 --> 01:31:32,605
Your bath, your massage,
your dinner, your injection!

1313
01:31:32,734 --> 01:31:34,774
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.

- You wouldn't be Sir Wilfrid, would you?
- I would.

1316
01:32:03,932 --> 01:32:08,677
Didn't recognise you without your wig.
Lovely you all look in them wigs.

Two o' yer? I'm not talking to two o' yer.

1318

This is Mr Mayhew,
Leonard Vole's solicitor.

1319
01:32:13,942 --> 01:32:16,978
- Well, that's all right, then.
- And your name, please?

1320
01:32:17,112 --> 01:32:22,568
No need for mine. If I did give you a name
it mightn't be the right one, might it?

1321
01:32:22,701 --> 01:32:26,948
'Ave a drink, boys.
Two whiskies for me gen'lmen friends.

1322
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,654
Now what is this information
you allegedly have?

1323
01:32:29,791 --> 01:32:34,252
You realise that you're duty-bound
to give any evidence that you might have?

1324
01:32:34,379 --> 01:32:39,006
- Come off it. Did you bring any money?
- What is it you have, madam?

1325
01:32:39,134 --> 01:32:43,630
Letters. Letters that German wife
of 'is wrote. That's what I've got.

1326
01:32:43,764 --> 01:32:48,592
- Letters written to the prisoner?
- To the prisoner? Don't make me laugh.

1327
01:32:48,727 --> 01:32:52,641
Poor bleeder, he's been took in
by 'er all right. And these letters prove it.

1328
01:32:52,773 --> 01:32:57,933
If we could see these letters, we could
advise you as to how pertinent they are.

1329
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:00,822
Well, I don't expect you...

1330
01:33:04,034 --> 01:33:08,079
Well, as I say, I don't expect you
to buy without seeing, but fair's fair.

1331
01:33:08,205 --> 01:33:12,748
If these letters get the boy off,
it's? 100 for me, right?

1332
01:33:12,876 --> 01:33:17,752
If these letters contain information useful
to the defence, I'm prepared to offer? 10.

1333
01:33:17,881 --> 01:33:21,297
What? Ten bleeding pounds
for letters like these?

1334
01:33:21,427 --> 01:33:24,262
Take that piece of glass
out o' yer eye. Good night.

1335
01:33:24,388 --> 01:33:26,511
If these help prove my client's innocence,

1336
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:30,175
? 20 should, I think, not be an
unreasonable sum for your expenses.

1337
01:33:30,311 --> 01:33:33,347
50 and it's a bargain.
That's if you're satisfied with 'em.

1338
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:35,853
- ? 40.
- All right, blast yer.

1339
01:33:35,983 --> 01:33:38,854
'Ere, take 'em. Nice little lot there.

1340
01:33:38,986 --> 01:33:41,026
How do we know
these are from Mrs Vole?

1341
01:33:41,155 --> 01:33:45,484
Oh, she wrote 'em all right.
It's all fair an' square.

1342
01:33:48,078 --> 01:33:50,949
I 'ope they fix 'er good and proper.

1343
01:33:52,833 --> 01:33:56,701
I've had messages from Mrs Vole.
It looks like her handwriting.

1344
01:33:56,837 --> 01:33:59,293
Good heavens, look at this.

1345
01:34:01,884 --> 01:34:03,924
Juicy, ain't they?

1346
01:34:04,053 --> 01:34:08,003
- There's one that's even better.
- How did you get hold of these?

1347
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:11,225
What's the difference
so long as she gets what's coming?

1348
01:34:11,352 --> 01:34:14,519
- What have you got against her?
- Ha!

1349
01:34:14,647 --> 01:34:18,063
I'll give you something
to dream about, mister.

1350
01:34:19,151 --> 01:34:21,607
Want to kiss me, ducky?

1351
01:34:25,283 --> 01:34:26,065
Ha!

1352
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:30,150
- I didn't suppose you would.
- Christine Vole did that to you?

1353
01:34:30,288 --> 01:34:35,246
Not 'er, the chap I was going with. He was
a bit younger than me but I loved 'im.

1354
01:34:35,376 --> 01:34:40,371
Then she come along, started seeing 'im
on the sly. Then one day he cleared out.

1355
01:34:40,506 --> 01:34:45,927
I found 'em together. I said what I thought
of 'er and he cut me face up proper.

1356
01:34:46,053 --> 01:34:50,431
- Did you go to the police about it?
- Who, me? Not likely.

1357
01:34:50,558 --> 01:34:56,312
It wasn't 'is fault. It was all 'ers, gettin' 'im
away from me, turnin' 'im against me.

1358
01:34:56,439 --> 01:35:01,350
But I waited me time to pay 'er back.
And it's come now.

1359
01:35:01,486 --> 01:35:06,776
I'm deeply sorry, deeply sorry.
We'll make it another? 5 for the letters.

1360
01:35:06,908 --> 01:35:11,237
'Olding out on me, were yer?
I knew I was being soft with yer.

1361

Unbelievable.

1363

We'd better have the full name of the man
to whom these were addressed, Miss...

1364

Where is she?

1366
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:39,849
On that train, I should think. Doesn't want
her other cheek slashed. Can't blame her.

1367
01:35:42,235 --> 01:35:44,311
- Care for another, sir?
- Hm?

1368
01:35:44,446 --> 01:35:46,485
Good idea.

Be upstanding in court.

1372
01:36:00,295 --> 01:36:03,000
All persons who have anything
to do before my lords,

1373
01:36:03,131 --> 01:36:05,254
the queen's justices of oyer and terminer

1374
01:36:05,383 --> 01:36:09,381
and general jail delivery for the
jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court,

01:36:09,512 --> 01:36:13,842
draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.

1376
01:36:27,697 --> 01:36:30,983
Since the defence has called
but one witness, the prisoner,

1377
01:36:31,117 --> 01:36:33,525
it has the right to be heard last.

1378
01:36:33,662 --> 01:36:39,949
Mr Myers, if you are ready, let us have
the final address for the prosecution.

1379
01:36:40,085 --> 01:36:44,462
My lord, members of the jury,
I will be brief in my final speech

1380
01:36:44,589 --> 01:36:49,298
because I think we've proved so obvious
a case of murder against Leonard Vole,

1381
01:36:49,428 --> 01:36:52,843
that a verdict of guilty
must be the only possible conclusion.

1382
01:36:53,473 --> 01:36:57,174
<i>- I will briefly summarise these facts...
- (footsteps)</i>

1383
01:37:02,941 --> 01:37:05,230
You'd better begin again, Mr Myers.

1384
01:37:05,819 --> 01:37:10,113
That is, if Sir Wilfrid
is at all interested in our proceedings.

1385
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:14,701
I am, indeed, my lord. The speech
for the crown, however, is premature.

1386
01:37:14,828 --> 01:37:19,823
I ask that the case for the defence be
reopened. And that a witness be recalled.

1387
01:37:19,958 --> 01:37:23,826
I most strenuously object to the case
being reopened at this final stage.

1388
01:37:23,962 --> 01:37:27,212
Evidence of a startling nature
has come into my possession.

1389
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:30,757
The course my learned friend
proposes is quite unprecedented.

1390
01:37:30,886 --> 01:37:34,670
I have anticipated this objection
and can meet it with ample precedent.

1391
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:40,596
There is the king vs Stillman, reported
in the criminal appeal reports of 1926

1392
01:37:40,729 --> 01:37:43,137
at page 463.

1393
01:37:43,273 --> 01:37:47,520
Also, the king vs Porter in volume one
of the king's bench division reports,

1394
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:51,069
1942 at page 153.

1395
01:37:51,198 --> 01:37:54,069
And lastly there is the case
of the king vs Sullivan

1396
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:58,281
in which this issue was raised, which
I'm sure Your Lordship will remember,

1397
01:37:58,414 --> 01:38:00,987
since you appeared for the prosecution.

1398
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:05,834
I did? Oh, yes, before Mr Justice Swindon.

1399
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:08,205
What is this new evidence, Sir Wilfrid?

1400
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:10,416
Letters, my lord.

1401
01:38:10,551 --> 01:38:13,635
Letters written by Christine Helm.

1402
01:38:15,973 --> 01:38:19,556
My lord, the prosecution
continues its objection.

1403
01:38:19,685 --> 01:38:23,220
If my memory serves me well,
Your Lordship's similar objection

1404
01:38:23,355 --> 01:38:27,104
in the king against Sullivan
was sustained.

1405
01:38:28,986 --> 01:38:32,569
Your memory, for once,
serves you ill, Mr Myers.

1406
01:38:32,698 --> 01:38:37,241
My objection then was overruled
by Mr Justice Swindon.

1407
01:38:37,369 --> 01:38:40,536
As yours is now, by me.

1408
01:38:40,664 --> 01:38:42,704
<i>(muttering)</i>

1409
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:49,127

- Christine Helm.

wouldn't mind betting you a box of cigars.

1413
01:39:16,242 --> 01:39:20,240
Mrs Helm, you appreciate
you are still under oath?

1414
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:21,569
Yes.

1415
01:39:21,706 --> 01:39:27,411
- Do you know a man named Max?
- I don't know what you mean.

1416
01:39:27,545 --> 01:39:31,543
It's a simple question. Do you
or do you not know a man called Max?

1417
01:39:31,674 --> 01:39:33,963
Max? Certainly not.

1418
01:39:34,093 --> 01:39:37,925
It's a fairly common name and yet
you've never known a man named Max?

1419
01:39:38,056 --> 01:39:40,547
In Germany, perhaps, but a long time ago.

1420
01:39:40,683 --> 01:39:47,564
I shall not ask you to go back that far.
Just a few weeks, to... October 20 last.

1421
01:39:49,192 --> 01:39:52,146
- What have you got there?
- A letter.

1422
01:39:52,278 --> 01:39:54,603
I suggest that on October 20

1423
01:39:54,739 --> 01:39:58,073
- you wrote a letter...
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1424
01:39:58,201 --> 01:40:01,700
...addressed to a man named Max.
- I did nothing of the sort.

1425
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:05,910
The letter was but one of a series
written to the same man.

1426
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:08,874
Lies! All lies!

1427
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:13,131
You seem to have been, well, let us say,
on intimate terms with this man.

1428
01:40:13,258 --> 01:40:16,009
How dare you say a thing like that?
It isn't true!

1429
01:40:16,135 --> 01:40:21,640
I'm not concerned with the general trend
of this correspondence, only one letter.

1430
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:26,642
"My beloved Max,
an extraordinary thing has happened."

1431
01:40:26,771 --> 01:40:29,725
"I believe all our difficulties
may be ended."

1432
01:40:29,858 --> 01:40:32,431
I will not stand here
and listen to a pack of lies!

1433
01:40:32,569 --> 01:40:36,401
That letter's a forgery.
It isn't even my letter paper!

1434
01:40:36,531 --> 01:40:38,820
- It isn't?
- No!

1435
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:42,366
I write my letters on small blue paper
with my initials on it.

1436
01:40:46,458 --> 01:40:48,000
Like this?

01:41:33,755 --> 01:41:39,959
Sir Wilfrid, will you now read the letter
in question so that the jury may hear it?

1451
01:41:45,017 --> 01:41:50,307
"My beloved Max,
an extraordinary thing has happened."

1452
01:41:50,439 --> 01:41:54,104
"All our difficulties may soon be solved."

1453
01:41:54,234 --> 01:41:59,311
"Leonard is suspected of murdering
the old lady I told you about."

1454
01:41:59,448 --> 01:42:05,284
"His only hope of an alibi
depends on me and me alone."

1455
01:42:06,330 --> 01:42:12,582
"Suppose I testify that he was not at home
with me at the time of the murder,

1456
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:16,579
that he came home
with blood on his sleeves,

1457
01:42:16,715 --> 01:42:20,629
and that he even admitted to me
that he'd killed her?"

1458
01:42:20,761 --> 01:42:24,212
"Strange that he always said
he would never let me leave him."

1459
01:42:24,348 --> 01:42:27,966
"But now, if this succeeds,
he will be leaving me

1460
01:42:28,102 --> 01:42:31,969
because they will take him away forever

1461
01:42:32,106 --> 01:42:36,851
and I shall be free and yours,
my beloved."

1462
01:42:36,986 --> 01:42:41,813
"I count the hours until
we are together. Christine."

1463
01:42:44,868 --> 01:42:48,818
Mrs Helm?
Will you go back to the witness box?

1464
01:42:59,008 --> 01:43:04,250
I now ask you again, Christine Helm,
did you write this letter?

1465
01:43:04,388 --> 01:43:07,638
Christine, tell him you didn't write it.
I know you didn't.

1466
01:43:07,766 --> 01:43:11,895
Please answer my question.
Did you write this letter?

1467
01:43:12,021 --> 01:43:13,812
Before answering, Mrs Helm,

1468
01:43:13,939 --> 01:43:19,314
I wish to warn you that the law regarding
perjury in this country is very severe.

1469
01:43:19,445 --> 01:43:23,028
If you have already
committed perjury in this courtroom,

1470
01:43:23,157 --> 01:43:26,775
I strongly advise you
not to add to your crime.

1471
01:43:26,911 --> 01:43:30,659
But, if this letter
has not been written by you,

1472
01:43:30,790 --> 01:43:34,490
then now is the time to state this fact.

1473
01:43:37,004 --> 01:43:39,163
I wrote the letter.

1474
01:43:39,298 --> 01:43:41,540
<i>(muttering)</i>

1475
01:43:41,676 --> 01:43:45,590
And that, my lord,
is the case for the defence.

1476
01:43:53,437 --> 01:43:56,853
I keep asking which is harder,
your head or your arteries?

1477
01:43:56,983 --> 01:43:59,141
Stop pressing your luck, you're overdue.

1478
01:43:59,277 --> 01:44:03,405
We're all packed and ready.
I hope the jury won't take all afternoon.

1479
01:44:03,531 --> 01:44:04,729
I concede.

1480
01:44:04,866 --> 01:44:08,069
- Congratulations, here are your cigars.
- Not yet.

1481
01:44:08,202 --> 01:44:11,702
Come on, it's all over,
wrapped up neat and tidy.

1482
01:44:11,831 --> 01:44:15,247
- What's wrong?
- It's a little too neat, too tidy,

1483
01:44:15,376 --> 01:44:19,504
and altogether too symmetrical,
that's what's wrong with it.

1484
01:44:19,630 --> 01:44:22,881
- The jury is back.
- You're not worried about the verdict?

1485
01:44:23,009 --> 01:44:27,172
It's not their judgment
that worries me, it's mine.

1486
01:44:27,388 --> 01:44:29,215
Come along.

1487
01:44:30,183 --> 01:44:32,222
Where's my wig?

1488
01:45:01,172 --> 01:45:03,628
The prisoner will stand up.

1489
01:45:06,177 --> 01:45:11,135
Members of the jury,
are you all agreed upon your verdict?

1490
01:45:12,684 --> 01:45:13,929
We are.

1491
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:18,307
Do you find the prisoner at the bar,
Leonard Stephen Vole,

1492
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:22,983
guilty or not guilty
of the murder of Emily Jane French?

1493
01:45:26,906 --> 01:45:28,317
Not guilty, m'lord.

1494
01:45:28,450 --> 01:45:30,822
<i>(shouting / gasping)</i>

1495
01:45:48,345 --> 01:45:49,673
Silence!

1496
01:45:49,930 --> 01:45:51,673
Silence!

1497
01:45:54,601 --> 01:45:58,385
Leonard Stephen Vole,
you have been found not guilty

1498
01:45:58,522 --> 01:46:03,100
of the murder
of Emily Jane French on October 14.

1499
01:46:03,235 --> 01:46:07,731
You are hereby discharged
and are free to leave the court.

1500
01:46:18,625 --> 01:46:21,959
Persons with anything more to do
before the queen's justices

1501
01:46:22,087 --> 01:46:24,329
of oyer and terminer and jail delivery

1502
01:46:24,464 --> 01:46:29,422
for the jurisdiction of the Central
Criminal Court may depart the area.

1503
01:46:38,145 --> 01:46:41,845
Thank you. Yes, we'll talk later.
Thank you, Mr Mayhew.

1504
01:46:41,982 --> 01:46:44,473
Thank you, Mr Brogan-Moore. Carter.

1505
01:46:44,610 --> 01:46:48,026
Thank you, Sir Wilfrid, for everything.
You were wonderful.

1506
01:46:48,155 --> 01:46:51,987
- I'd say we were lucky all around.
- Yeah.

1507
01:46:52,117 --> 01:46:55,949
I have your belongings. Sign the receipt,
Mr Vole, and we can release you.

1508
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:59,199
"Mr Vole." They didn't call me Mr
when they charged me.

1509
01:46:59,333 --> 01:47:04,493
- I'll go with you, I have your hat and coat.
- Let's go before they change their mind!

1510
01:47:13,973 --> 01:47:17,223
Chipper, isn't he? An hour ago,
he had one foot on the gallows

1511
01:47:17,351 --> 01:47:19,474
and the other on a banana peel.

1512
01:47:19,603 --> 01:47:22,806
You ought to be very proud, Wilfrid.
Aren't you?

1513
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:25,941
Not yet. We've disposed of the gallows,

1514
01:47:26,068 --> 01:47:30,148
but there's still that banana peel
somewhere, under somebody's foot.

1515
01:47:30,281 --> 01:47:31,905
<i>(commotion)</i>

1516
01:47:43,752 --> 01:47:48,414
<i>- (woman) Every word you said was a lie!
- (man) You ought to be locked up! Liar!</i>

1517
01:47:48,549 --> 01:47:51,883
You'd better wait here
until we get rid of that crowd, madam.

1518
01:47:52,011 --> 01:47:54,050
Thank you.

1519
01:47:57,808 --> 01:48:01,094
Ready, sir? Miss Plimsoll will be waiting.

1520
01:48:01,228 --> 01:48:06,768
Let me finish the last of the cocoa
while I'm still beyond her jurisdiction.

1521
01:48:06,901 --> 01:48:11,278
Would you excuse me,
Brogan-Moore, Carter? Thank you.

1522
01:48:38,224 --> 01:48:42,304
I never thought you British could get
so emotional. Especially in public.

1523
01:48:42,436 --> 01:48:44,974
- I apologise for my compatriots.
- It's all right.

1524
01:48:45,106 --> 01:48:49,020
I don't mind being called names or
pushed around or even kicked in the shin.

1525
01:48:49,152 --> 01:48:51,477
But I have a ladder
in my last pair of nylons.

1526
01:48:51,612 --> 01:48:55,906
In case you are not familiar with
our prison regulations, no silk stockings.

1527
01:48:56,034 --> 01:48:58,240
Prison? Will I go to prison?

1528
01:48:58,369 --> 01:49:01,987
You heard the judge.
You will certainly be charged with perjury,

1529
01:49:02,123 --> 01:49:06,452
- tried for it, and to prison you shall go.
- Well, it won't be for life, will it?

1530
01:49:06,586 --> 01:49:10,204
If I were appearing
for the prosecution, it would be.

1531
01:49:10,340 --> 01:49:14,337
You loathe me, don't you?
Like the people outside.

1532
01:49:14,469 --> 01:49:17,589
What a wicked woman I am,
and how brilliantly you exposed me

1533
01:49:17,722 --> 01:49:22,431
and saved Leonard's life.
The great Sir Wilfrid Robarts did it again.

1534
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:28,314
Well, let me tell you something.
You didn't do it alone. You had help.

1535
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:31,108
What are you driving at?

1536
01:49:31,236 --> 01:49:34,190
I'm not driving at anything.
Leonard is free and we did it.

1537
01:49:34,322 --> 01:49:35,733
- We?
- Remember?

1538
01:49:35,865 --> 01:49:39,530
When you said that no jury would
believe an alibi given by a loving wife,

1539
01:49:39,661 --> 01:49:43,741
no matter how much she swore
he was innocent? That gave me the idea.

1540
01:49:43,873 --> 01:49:45,451
What idea?

1541
01:49:45,583 --> 01:49:50,080
The idea that I should be a witness, not
for my husband, but for the prosecution.

1542
01:49:50,213 --> 01:49:54,163
That I should swear Leonard was guilty
and that you should expose me as a liar

1543
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:58,547
because only then would they believe
Leonard was innocent.

1544
01:49:58,680 --> 01:50:02,380
So now you know
the whole story, Sir Wilfrid.

1545
01:50:07,689 --> 01:50:11,900
I'll give yer something
to dream about, mister.

1546
01:50:12,027 --> 01:50:14,696
Want to kiss me, ducky?

1547
01:50:18,450 --> 01:50:22,530
I suspected something, but not that.

1548
01:50:22,662 --> 01:50:25,663
- Never that!
- Thank you for the compliment.

1549
01:50:25,790 --> 01:50:29,539
It's been a long time since I acted
and I never played such a vital role.

1550
01:50:29,669 --> 01:50:32,540
All those blue letters!

1551
01:50:32,672 --> 01:50:36,291
It took me hours to write them,
to invent Max. There never was a Max.

1552
01:50:36,426 --> 01:50:38,882
There's never been anyone but Leonard.

1553
01:50:39,012 --> 01:50:41,254
My dear, could you not have trusted me,

1554
01:50:41,389 --> 01:50:45,339
worked with me truthfully
and honourably? We would have won.

1555
01:50:45,477 --> 01:50:48,394
I could not run that risk.
You thought he was innocent.

1556
01:50:48,522 --> 01:50:51,688
And you knew he was innocent.
I understand.

1557
01:50:51,817 --> 01:50:55,102
No, Sir Wilfrid,
you do not understand at all.

1558
01:50:55,237 --> 01:50:57,692
I knew he was guilty.

1559
01:51:01,118 --> 01:51:04,072
That can't be true! No!

1560
01:51:05,289 --> 01:51:07,696
Listen to me, once and for all.

1561
01:51:07,833 --> 01:51:10,538
He came home after ten,
he had blood on his sleeves,

1562
01:51:10,669 --> 01:51:14,120
he said he had killed the woman,
only I could save him. He pleaded.

1563
01:51:14,256 --> 01:51:17,376
And you saved him? A murderer?

1564
01:51:17,509 --> 01:51:19,632
Again, you don't understand.

1565
01:51:19,761 --> 01:51:21,801
I love him.

1566
01:51:27,603 --> 01:51:29,975
I told you she was an actress.
And a good one.

1567
01:51:30,105 --> 01:51:31,730
Leonard!

1568
01:51:31,857 --> 01:51:35,024
I knew she'd do something,
but I just didn't know what or how.

1569
01:51:35,152 --> 01:51:37,191
Leonard, Leonard.

1570
01:51:39,239 --> 01:51:44,744
- Fooled you completely, didn't she?
- It was you, Vole, who fooled me.

1571
01:51:44,870 --> 01:51:50,540
Oh, easy. Easy. We both got
out of this alive, let's stay this way.

1572
01:51:50,668 --> 01:51:54,167
- Where are your pills?
- You've made a mockery of English law.

1573
01:51:54,296 --> 01:51:57,546
Who did? You got me off
and I can't be tried again for this.

1574
01:51:57,675 --> 01:52:02,253
- That's English law too, isn't it?
- You can't touch him now. Nobody can.

1575
01:52:02,388 --> 01:52:05,092
The scales of justice
may tip one way or another,

1576
01:52:05,224 --> 01:52:08,344
but ultimately they balance out.
You'll pay for this.

1577
01:52:08,477 --> 01:52:12,641
Ultimately's a long way off. I'd rather
pay for it as soon as possible and in cash.

1578
01:52:12,773 --> 01:52:17,316
Suppose we double your fee? There'll be
lots of money once the will goes through.

1579
01:52:17,444 --> 01:52:20,398
I'm not cheap, I want everybody
to get something out of it.

1580
01:52:20,531 --> 01:52:24,114
There's Janet McKenzie.
We'll get her that new hearing aid.

1581
01:52:24,243 --> 01:52:29,238
And we'll get you a new one of these.
18-carat gold if they make them.

1582
01:52:29,373 --> 01:52:33,074
And when they try you for perjury
there'll be? 5,000 for the defence.

1583
01:52:33,210 --> 01:52:37,956
I don't care, just so we'll be together.
You don't know what I've been through.

1584
01:52:38,090 --> 01:52:43,048
Standing in the witness box, having
to face you, saying I never loved you.

1585
01:52:43,179 --> 01:52:44,377
What is it, Leonard?

1586
01:52:44,513 --> 01:52:48,381
The luggage is in the car and we've
only 20 minutes to catch the boat train.

1587
01:52:48,517 --> 01:52:51,091
This is a nice young lady
I met during the trial.

1588
01:52:51,228 --> 01:52:52,557
Len!

1589
01:52:52,688 --> 01:52:54,348
Oh, Len!

1590
01:52:54,482 --> 01:52:56,106
Len...

1591
01:52:57,735 --> 01:53:01,436
Oh, Len, they've been trying to keep
me away. It's had me nearly crazy.

1592
01:53:01,572 --> 01:53:04,063
Leonard, who's this girl?

1593
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:06,905
I'm not this girl, I'm his girl.

1594
01:53:07,036 --> 01:53:08,863
Tell her, Len.

1595
01:53:08,996 --> 01:53:12,496
Leonard, is this the girl
who was with you in the travel bureau?

1596
01:53:12,625 --> 01:53:15,792
The girl you said you hardly knew,
didn't even know her name?

1597
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:20,582
That's right. That's who I am and I know
all about you. You're not his wife.

1598
01:53:20,716 --> 01:53:25,010
Never have been. You're years older than
he is. We've been together for months

1599
01:53:25,138 --> 01:53:31,057
and we're going away on a cruise,
just like they said in court. Tell her, Len.

1600
01:53:31,185 --> 01:53:36,180
- Yes, Len, tell me yourself.
- All right, Diana, come along.

1601
01:53:36,315 --> 01:53:39,020
You can't, not after what I've done.
I won't let you.

1602
01:53:39,152 --> 01:53:42,106
I saved your life
getting you out of Germany,

1603
01:53:42,238 --> 01:53:45,441
you got me out of this mess,
so we're even. It's over now.

1604
01:53:45,575 --> 01:53:50,118
Don't, Leonard! Don't leave me!
Don't, Leonard! Don't!

1605
01:53:50,246 --> 01:53:53,117
Pull yourself together.
They'll have you up for perjury.

1606
01:53:53,249 --> 01:53:57,828
Don't make it worse
or they'll try you as an accessory.

1607
01:53:57,962 --> 01:54:00,251
And you know what that means.

1608
01:54:00,381 --> 01:54:05,043
I don't care. Let them. Let them try me
for perjury, or an accessory, or...

1609
01:54:06,054 --> 01:54:08,723
- Ready?
- Or better yet...

1610
01:54:08,848 --> 01:54:10,841
let them try me for...!

1611
01:54:10,975 --> 01:54:12,802
Argh!

1612
01:54:16,105 --> 01:54:17,932
<i>(Diana screams)</i>

1613
01:54:19,651 --> 01:54:21,478
<i>(sobs)</i>

1614
01:54:34,374 --> 01:54:38,917
- Call a doctor.
- It's no use. No doctor can help now.

1615
01:54:39,963 --> 01:54:42,370
- What happened?
- She killed him.

1616
01:54:42,507 --> 01:54:44,500
Killed him?

1617
01:54:44,634 --> 01:54:46,876
She executed him.

1618
01:54:48,513 --> 01:54:51,087
Carter, what have you done
with the luggage?

1619
01:54:51,224 --> 01:54:56,930
I sent it on ahead to the station,
and I've got a cab waiting outside.

1620
01:55:03,486 --> 01:55:07,436
- A remarkable woman.
- You can just barely catch the boat train.

1621
01:55:07,574 --> 01:55:11,358
Better bring the luggage back,
and you can dismiss the cab.

1622
01:55:11,495 --> 01:55:14,579
We are not going yet, are we?

1623
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,871
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.

1624
01:55:20,003 --> 01:55:22,672
Get Brogan-Moore to my chambers,
and Mayhew too.

1625
01:55:22,798 --> 01:55:27,091
We're appearing for the defence
in the trial of Christine Vole.

1626
01:55:27,219 --> 01:55:29,046
Sir Wilfrid?

1627
01:55:29,179 --> 01:55:31,848
You've forgotten your brandy.

1628
01:55:54,682 --> 01:55:56,591
