[Get to the lodging first!]

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,140
[And you can swap money
with the other team!]

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,430
[Team Jong Shin had a comeback!]

[Ho Dong is all alone with just W7,000.]

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,620
Bring the popcorn. That's ours!

[His stomach hurts
due to stress from Hyo Ri.]

close to the others?]

[How will he survive alone
with just W7,000?]

16

[5:30pm: almost dinnertime.]

18
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,250
What else could I do?

19
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,700
You should go find work or something.

20
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,510
Everyone, come on out.
Let's eat dinner.

21
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,970
- It's cold.
- Because we're in the mountains.

22
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,570
You didn't eat the popcorn
we left there.

23
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,050
- Where?
- Right there. A few pieces.

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,340
You have amazing self-control.

25
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,670
Do you want to get beaten?

26
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,090
Come and beat me if you can!

27
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,030
- Eunhyuk!
- Yes, Ho Dong?

28
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,800
- Let's go.
- Huh?

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,370
Let's go check out the village.

30
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,280
I think you're the only thing
that's worth checking out in this village.

31
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,080
Don't be stubborn.
Come join us.

32
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,530
- Come on...
- I should keep my words like a man.

You need to stick to me or
to the other members...

37
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,480
In my opinion, the Hyo Ri
and Ho Dong duo is pretty cool.

38
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,410
I think the two of them make a great
duo for an entertainment show.

39
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,480
Don't you have too much
time on your hands?

40
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,290
No, I don't. I need to go
practice for my comeback show.

41
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,070
If I don't do well on my first live show,
it's all your fault.

42
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,240
- How come?
- I came on this show because of you.

43
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,480
Did I cast you?

44
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,050
I don't even know your phone number!

45
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,570
I came on the show because
I wanted to cheer you up.

46
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,650
I wanted to cheer you up! I mean it.

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,180
Everyone in the entertainment
business is trying to help him out.

[Explosion!]

- You said you'd go alone.
- He's on our team.

51
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,710
Come back safely.

52
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,040
Okay then. I'll be back.
You take care of them.

53
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,450
Okay? You should take care of them.

54
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,350
Look at your ugly feet.
Those toes are...

55
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,770
- Just go!
- Okay, I will go...

56
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,150
My stomach...

57
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,260
We will wait for you here.

58
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,390
My team, let's go look around!

59

- I get only the two of you?
- Yes.

61
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:56,340
Are you sure the two of you
can capture my amazing gag?

62
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,350
Gosh!

63
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,330
You must be kidding!

64
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,280
I have so much to show on camera!
Amazing stories with the villagers...

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,960
But just two cameras to shoot all that?

66
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,710
That's too many!

67
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,740
[Whatever...]

68
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,310
[Anyway, how can I get dinner?]

69
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,640
Where should I go
to look around the village?

70
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,510
To look around?

71
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,300
- Go take the middle street.
- The middle street?

72
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,480
- Our house is that way too.
- Is it really?

73
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,010
Why don't we go together?

74
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,350
[Can you give me some of that?]

75
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,780
Kid, watch the road.
It's dangerous.

76
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,030
[Spotted the ice cream in his hand.]

77
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,690
[Cautious...]

78
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,250
- How old are you?
- Five years old.

79
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,990
Five years old?
What's your name? Huh?

80
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,880
- Ki...
- Ki?

81
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,780
Ki Yong Kwang?
You are a handsome boy!

82
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,450
Yong Kwang!
Can I have some of that?

83
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,910
What is that?

84
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,700
It's nothing...

85
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,280
Can you share it with me?

86
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,250
Yong Kwang! Please let me have some!

87
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,170
Please share with me, Yong Kwang!

88
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,420
That's food! Are you going
to eat all of that?

89
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,050
You'll get fat!

90
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,530
What grade are you in?
Introduce yourself to the camera.

91
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,920
I'm Kang Soo Won in the fourth grade.

92
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,720
- Is your last name Kang?
- Yes.

93
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,690
My last name is Kang too.
Let's shake hands.

94
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,000
[Still eating...]

95
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,030
You know what? You and I look alike.

96
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,840
- Like father...
- Like son...

97
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,980
At school...

98
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,300
What did your teacher say about sharing?

99
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,480
Did he say to share with your friends?

100
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,500
Or did he say you should be greedy?

101
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,710
- He said share.
- Did he say that?

102
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,770
- Really?
- Yes.

103
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,180
So this is...

104
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,840
Wow.

105
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,370
Are you going to share it?

106
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,870
Yes. So I'm taking it to my relative.

107
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,860
- You're taking it to your relative?
- Yes.

108
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,050
I guess it won't work then.

109
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,080
One more time. Like father...

110
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,160
Like son...

111
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,110
Okay. Go take it to your relatives.

112
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,410
[I'm hungry...]

113
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,120
[Where can I get food?]

114
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,820
What should we do about dinner?

115
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,380
- You guys haven't tried Hyo Ri's food.
- I really want to try her food!

116
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,560
- I heard it's good!
- It'd make you want to date me.

117
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,380
- Because of food?
- Yes.

118
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,490
Can I just eat your food?

119
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,600
We have potatoes... Potato pancakes?

120
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,540
- Potato pancakes?
- That sounds good for a rainy day.

121
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,760
That sounds good.

122
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,050
Let's make a simple meal with
potato pancakes and fried veggies.

123
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,330
My mouth is already watering!

124
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,280
- Let's go buy some rice.
- I will go.

125
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,380
- The market is right there.
- Yeah?

126
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,830
Let's go get rice.

127
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,120
To the market?

128
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,720
Should I go catch some snails
in the rice field?

129
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,710
Why don't you go with Si Yoon...

130
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,260
and get some side dishes like Kimchi
from the neighbors?

131
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,670
Okay.

132
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,330
[Just the two of us?]

133
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,510
[Awkward...]

134
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,710
[They look uncomfortable
for some reason...]

135
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,020
This is what Ho Dong
would do as a show host.

136
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,360
When was the last time
you had a girlfriend?

137
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,600
Why don't you answer?

138
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,170
I...

139
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,480
- In the last year? Or before that?
- Way before that.

140
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,810
I see.

141
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,820
What about you?
Do you still love her?

142
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,410
- What?
- That older woman?

143
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,060
That older woman?

144
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,550
No, it didn't end well.

145
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,070
- Was she really older than you?
- Yes.

146
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,150
Wow.

147
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,940
I guess we really don't
know about each other.

148
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,250
This is nice. Should we sit here and talk?

149
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,530
- Should we?
- Yeah.

150
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,010
So... do you still love her?

151
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,660
No... I just wish her happiness.

152
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,830
- Really?
- Yes.

153
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,420
- Is she the celebrity that I know?
- No, not at all.

154
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,240
- She's not the one?
- No, no.

155
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,940
You really had someone.

156
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,680
- You were caught off guard.
- No, I wasn’t.

157
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,630
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

158
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,430
She... was a good singer.

159
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,690
- And a good actress.
- No, I said she's not a celebrity.

160
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,010
She could be good at acting
without being a celebrity.

161
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,100
- She could also be good at singing.
- She's not a celebrity.

162
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,660
Please put a caption over here
she's not a celebrity.

163
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,520
How tall is she?
Over or below 160 centimeters?

164
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,720
I don't know but when I held her...

165
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,260
I held her like this...

166
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,000
[Reminiscing about her...]

167
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,250
I held her like this even
the day before we broke up.

168
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,140
And you guys still broke up?

169
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,030
Which is your type?
Hyo Ri or UEE?

170
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,650
UEE.

171
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,430
What about you?

172
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,760
Of course, it's Hyo Ri for me.

173
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:16,540
But Hyo Ri is totally different
from the time she was in Fin.K.L.

174
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,560
How so?

175
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,500
She was really pretty back then.

176
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,280
- And she's not now?
- Well...

177
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,030
She's cool now.

178
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,520
She's so cool. I just can't help
thinking that when I see her.

179
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,890
What about UEE?

180
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,570
UEE?

181
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,240
Well... with UEE...

182
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,680
We had conversations no more
than three times on the show.

183
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,080
When UEE sees me...

184
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,500
- You treat her like an older sister...
- She just greets me like this...

185
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,010
- You are too proper to her.
- I know.

186
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,250
I hope you can get closer to her today.

187
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,540
Should we go play a game
to bring you two closer?

188
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,710
Hey!

189
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,160
You should be a man,
act like a man of authority.

190
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,430
'Hey, come over here!'

191
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,540
'Cut the onions.'

192
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,280
- Can I do that?
- Be mean but desirable.

193
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,080
She'd think, 'Why is he doing this to me?'

194
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,160
But she'd be interested in you.

195
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,640
[30 minutes later]

196
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,290
- Like a mirage?
- Oh, hi!

197
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,690
Hello!

198
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,210
Do you want to trade Kimchi
for Si Yoon's autograph?

199
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,700
Do you know me? I got too tan.

200
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,150
It's Kim Hyun Joong!

201
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,400
- Did you eat dinner?
- Not yet.

202
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,180
Then dinner must be getting ready.

203
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,390
I'll take a photo of
you and Si Yoon together...

204
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,950
if you go ask your mom to
give us some side dishes?

205
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,900
- Our house is right up there.
- I see.

206
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,340
- It's right there.
- Really?

207
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,760
What a nice house!

208
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,330
Mom! Do you have some side dishes?

209
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,410
Hello! Hello!

210
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,460
May we come in for a moment?

211
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,800
Just whatever you have...
we need just a little.

212
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,280
- That's good.
- Do you want fish to grill?

213
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,460
No, thank you.

214
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,140
That's more than enough.

215
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,500
That's enough.

216
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,720
Wow, wow!

217
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,240
That's enough.
That's enough for us.

218
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,970
- You should save it for your family.
- That's enough.

219
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,380
Wow, thank you so much!

220
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,940
And the cabbage Kimchi too...

221
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,380
Wow...

222
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,780
This is the famous southern Jolla Kimchi.

223
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,530
Let me taste southern Jolla Kimchi.

224
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,740
This is delicious!

225
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,020
Thank you so much!

226
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,530
Kimchi and egg.

227
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,450
- Thank you for the food.
- We will enjoy the food!

228
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,580
Thank you for the food, Ma'am.
We will go back now.

229
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,090
Bye!

230
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,150
- Thank you!
- You are awesome!

231
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,450
Do you know where we came from?

232
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,700
Barefoot Friends!

233
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,920
Wow! Thank you!

234
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,540
Oh, the wrong slippers!

235
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,900
I'm sorry. Those looked better than mine.

236
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,830
- Bye-bye!
- Good bye!

237
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,660
Now that I look at myself...

238
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,700
I look funny wearing
socks with the slippers.

239
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,840
You're fine.

240
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,860
Forget about fashion on this show...

241
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,190
- Don't you agree?
- Yes, I do.

242
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,180
We bought two bags of
potatoes, which is a lot!

243
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,810
Let's do it quickly.

244
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,130
Go wash these, Jong Shin.

245
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,940
[He got used to listening to her.]

246
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,380
These don't need washing, right?

247
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,040
Wash after you peel them.

248
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,790
I'm doing her errands
for the first time in the long time.

249
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,670
- I swore not to do that again.
- Didn't you miss that?

250
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,440
I wonder where Ho Dong is.

251
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,040
I hope he's not having a feast somewhere.

252
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,640
He must be eating at someone's place.

253
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,990
He's super popular with the older ladies.

254
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,700
It's so much fun playing in the water!

255
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,070
It's so much fun!

256
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,410
[Did he eat dinner anyway?]

257
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,890
Feels so nice!

258
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,360
So cold...

259
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,530
[He's cold and hungry...]

260
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:32,190
I won't look pathetic to the guys.

261
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,490
If I ever failed to eat...

262
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,530
one's image is very important.

263
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,460
The vibe he gives is important.
So I would pretend to have eaten.

264
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,040
Like I could eat no more.

265
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,650
Pretend you ate too.

266
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,700
Pretend you ate with me.

267
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,940
You are my team.

268
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,040
Don't let me down.

269
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,050
They'll give me food
when I look indifferent.

270
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,450
Then I will eat just to be polite.

271
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,800
[Will Ho Dong's plan really work?]

272
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,090
- Sesame seeds? Green onion?
- There are sesame seeds in front of Bum Soo.

273
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,650
- The onion with leaves...
- I'm slicing them now.

274
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,900
- You mean these?
- Slice them.

275
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,510
- Slice them all.
- Sprinkle some pepper.

276
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,510
Smells so good.

277
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,220
- Smells good.
- It looks delicious.

278
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,140
- It's Ho Dong.
- Where?

279
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,300
- You are here!
- He's biting a toothpick.

280
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,970
I ate a lot.

281
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,360
- Where?
- Next to Surak Waterfall.

282
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,320
- Your tummy looks flat.
- No, it's full.

283
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,340
Did you really eat?

284
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,830
- I had mixed veggie rice.
- Really?

285
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,150
It was exactly W7,000.
And...

286
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:45,180
- Because I'm a celebrity...
- Okay, we won't give you any food then.

287
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,420
- I won't eat.
- Really?

288
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,430
Yes.

289
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,470
They gave me tofu on the house.

290
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,790
This much...

291
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,390
- After the filming was done...
- Aren't you going to eat?

292
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,230
- I said I already ate.
- Really?

293
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,660
Where did you eat mixed veggie rice
for just W7,000?

294
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,980
Oh, well...

295
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,460
There are lots of restaurants
by Surak Waterfall.

296
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,620
- Really?
- Yes, it was very good.

297
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,080
- That's great. We worried about you.
- Yeah?

298
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,070
It looks ugly, but should taste good.

299
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,740
- It looks ruined.
- Yes, it does.

300
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,930
[Aren't they offering to taste a little?]

301
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,100
[Don't touch!]

302
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,800
[You, heartless...]

303
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,370
You said you were full.

304
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,420
Why are you taking that?

305
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,300
Okay, my stomach is about to burst.

306
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,270
[Ho Dong's plan failed!]

307
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,810
You sound really hungry.

308
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,600
My stomach hurts now.

309
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,170
My stomach is so full it hurts now.

310
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,610
We're going to make ramen.

311
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,840
- You said you were full!
- You are full!

312
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,710
- We are going to make ramen.
- What?

313
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,920
Should I try that? Can I turn it over?

314
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,230
Good.

315
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,390
Just like that... oh, no!

316
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,740
You aren't going to eat that anyway.

317
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,660
- It looks...
- It doesn't look good... look here.

318
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,280
We're going to eat that.

319
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,250
Hold on. Hold on!

320
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,540
Not good...

321
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,540
What are you doing?
I am good at this.

322
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,710
- Don't let him eat.
- Don't give it to him.

323
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,550
I didn't know a toothpick could
be such a strong weapon.

324
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,640
Cook it a little longer.

325
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,640
- Let me try with this.
- Okay.

326
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,220
Wow, Mount Jiri is really nice...

327
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,180
[Not interested...]

328
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,680
I ate the mixed veggie rice
with my feet in the water.

329
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,500
And the free tofu.

330
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,940
- Did you really eat?
- Set the table just for eight.

331
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,570
Did you really eat, Ho Dong?

332
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,900
We have only eight spoons.

333
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,870
Ho Dong, we got this Kimchi from
the village and it's amazing.

334
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,300
This Kimchi is delicious.

335
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:53,460
Now I realize I'm in the Jolla Province.

336
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,380
- This table is perfect!
- It's nice!

337
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,770
- This table is...
- Are you having a food coma?

338
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,080
He's having a food coma
because he ate too much.

339
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,770
- The table needs cleaning...
- Like fathers after eating...

340
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,100
So busy...

341
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,070
- Here's the rice!
- Wow!

342
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,300
The rice is perfect.

343
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,770
Ho Dong, do you want to eat dessert?

344
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,140
- What do you have?
- Do you want fruit?

345
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,950
Do you want onion juice?

346
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,390
- It's good for health.
- Give him onion juice.

347
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,420
- It's good for blood circulation.
- That's right.

348
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,700
- Good for skin too.
- Yes, it is.

349
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,660
What a nice season it is. No mosquitoes...

350
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,900
It's a good season
to eat mixed veggie rice.

351
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,840
And free tofu...

352
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,500
There's lots of rice left,
since Ho Dong isn't eating.

353
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,590
- Should we make burnt rice?
- Yes.

354
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,260
- Make burnt rice?
- Let's serve it to the staff.

355
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,170
I will have two bowls of rice.

356
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,520
Thank you for the food!

357
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,810
Thank you for the food!

358
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,620
- Don't you want to eat?
- I already ate.

359
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,110
I will go eat then.

360
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,850
[You should ask one more time!]

361
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,640
It looks so delicious!

362
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,940
I'm going to eat a  lot!

363
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,180
Steamy rice!

364
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,970
Everything's good.

365
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,580
You don't even have chopsticks.

366
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,370
Have some potato.

367
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,130
Pass me that.

368
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,590
Aren't you going to eat, Ho Dong?

369
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,320
Please have some.

370
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,150
He said he's full.

371
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,040
- He worked hard too...
- I'll go for a walk.

372
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,850
Oh, my stomach...

373
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,450
I'm having a food coma.

374
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,660
Just say you want to eat too.

375
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,240
You shouldn't be so prideful.

376
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,170
How can I eat when I am so full!

377
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,990
Or you could make me work!

378
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,730
You could ask nicely!

379
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,950
Go bring the ramen from the kitchen then.

380
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,430
- What?
- Go bring the ramen.

381
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,630
Do I have to make it?

382
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,400
We already made it, so just go bring it.

383
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,680
You trust me with that?
I could eat it all by myself.

384
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,810
- We know.
- I'm touched. Okay.

385
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,900
Since you guys trust me, I will go get it.

386
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,080
- Of course, we do.
- Yes, you do.

387
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,750
I guess he really ate.

388
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,760
He must really have eaten.

389
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,010
Did he say he spent W7,000 on the food?

390
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,870
- Hyo Ri!
- Yeah?

391
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,350
- It's right here.
- Come on over.

392
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,900
That looks unsafe...

393
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,000
Thank you.

394
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,670
Gosh!

395
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,520
- I almost fell in the ramen.
- Ho Dong turned around.

396
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,480
Ho Dong, leave the food alone.

397
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,640
Ho Dong, this is your last chance.

398
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,670
Just tell us honestly if you didn't eat.

399
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,010
Just tell us honestly.

400
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,480
- This is your last chance.
- Did you eat or not?

401
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,390
It's right here, Ho Dong.

402
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,910
Oh, my God. I could almost cry.

403
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,070
- You didn't eat?
- I can't eat any more.

404
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,160
Hyo Ri, you can't do that to me.

405
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,620
I was about to give you the money...

406
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,850
You said you spent the money on food.

407
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,830
The W7000 is right here.

408
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,390
- Is this some kind of magic?
- So you didn't eat at all?

409
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,110
This is a sad story...

410
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,280
Hyo Ri took away his last chance...

411
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,390
Ho Dong...

412
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,400
It hurts!

413
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,060
I'm sorry, Ho Dong.
I'm really sorry!

414
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,830
My stomach hurts again.

415
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,150
Come on up!

416
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,790
- Come on!
- I'm fine...

417
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,440
Come on up!

418
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,000
Please don't do that.

419
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,210
If I sit here, they can only see my back.

420
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,560
We're being considerate.
They can only see your back.

421
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,090
- You may be embarrassed.
- To save you from embarrassment.

422
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,380
- Do you want me to eat like this?
- This is all yours.

423
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,090
- I must look funny from behind.
- It's okay.

424
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,160
Let's eat.

425
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,770
Look how he's scooping the ramen.

426
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,360
He must have been hungry.

427
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,180
Ho Dong, come over here.

428
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,940
I was feeling dizzy.

429
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,250
- Ho Dong, come on over.
- Let's scoot.

430
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,450
Have some kimchi with the ramen.

431
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,030
It's really good.

432
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,090
[Mount Jiri's highlight]

433
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,790
[Become one with the waterfalls!]

434
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,520
[Come on! Let's cool off!]

435
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,970
[Why did they jump in the water?]

436
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,500
[The first night on the retreat.]

437
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,890
I've watched all of you and realized...

438
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,330
You are too polite and too proper
with each other.

439
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,020
That's true.

440
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,940
Be nice when you should be.

441
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,350
But you should be honest
to each other too.

442
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,540
[Huh?]

443
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,080
'Don't come on the show
if you're sick, Jong Shin.'

444
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,480
You could say that
on a trip like this.

445
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,790
You could even reveal your secrets.

446
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:52,450
Why don't we take a moment
to get to know each other?

447
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,770
We can get close that way.

448
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,390
I prepared something for that.

449
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,070
'Straight Ball, Up and Down!'

450
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,520
'Straight Ball, Up and Down?'

451
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,090
Your straight ball can lift
your friends up or bring them down.

452
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,830
- Just one shot?
- Lift them up or bring them down.

453
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,140
Before dinner, all of you wrote...

454
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:13,030
what words lift you up
or bring you down.

455
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,290
Now you should figure out
what the others wrote.

456
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,840
I answered the questions very honestly.

457
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,240
- You answered them honestly?
- I did too.

458
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,800
- Me too.
- Should we start?

459
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,530
Let's start with Ho Dong.

460
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,720
What words would lift Ho Dong's spirits?

461
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,070
- Don't show that.
- Let's start with something positive.

462
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,110
Eunhyuk!

463
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,450
'You are sentimental.'

464
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,270
No? No?

465
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,480
Incorrect!

466
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,360
I think I heard that before.

467
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,790
- Ho Dong likes this kind of thing...
- He's sentimental?

468
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,820
Eunhyuk!

469
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,310
'You are romantic.'

470
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,370
Nope...

471
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,200
That's not it. UEE!

472
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,900
UEE was faster.

473
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,310
'You are a kind man.'

474
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,250
Bum Soo!

475
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,340
'You are successful!'

476
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,420
Incorrect.

477
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,520
Hyun Joong!

478
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,690
'He's better than Yoo Jae Seok.'

479
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,910
That's not it.

480
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,180
You shouldn't say just
anything to be correct.

481
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,600
He's loving it.

482
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,940
- He's so happy.
- He's loving it.

483
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,390
He loves it.

484
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,660
He's thinking he should've written that.

485
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,550
That was the wrong answer.

486
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,040
That's not it?

487
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,950
Is there anything better than that?

488
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,370
I don't think he's heard this often.

489
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,230
Has anyone ever said it to you?

490
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,790
- He probably has...
- In a private meeting...

491
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,180
- I heard that from a female.
- From a woman?

492
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,800
'Your head is smaller than I thought.

493
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,960
Incorrect.

494
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,020
Jong Shin! 'You aren't as
ignorant as I thought.'

495
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,910
Incorrect.

496
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,890
'You aren't as fat as I thought.'

497
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,680
What did you think then?

498
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,960
[I thought you'd be fat...]

499
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,850
Eunhyuk!

500
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,790
'You are sexy!'

501
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,570
Really?

502
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,760
- 'You are sexy!'
- You got it!

503
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,670
I mean it. I thought that sometimes.

504
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,440
When women tell me...

505
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,030
I look sexy in person even
though I don't look it on TV

506
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,480
it makes me feel good.

507
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,650
Ho Dong told me that before.

508
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,070
Now...

509
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,750
Good times are over.

510
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,130
Let's just talk about positive things...

511
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,250
What would make Ho Dong feel down?

512
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,530
Don't be too nice. We don't
live in a nice world.

513
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,950
Eunhyuk!

514
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,960
You got the chance! You sexy brother!

515
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,500
'Go back to wrestling.'

516
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,210
Isn't that it?

517
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,820
'You better go back to wrestling.'

518
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,920
Incorrect!

519
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,990
- These days this would be...
- Don't give out.

520
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,420
I think he'd be hurt to hear that.

521
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,940
- These days?
- Hurt?

522
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,170
- What would that be?
- Jong Shin!

523
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,210
'I feel sorry for him.'

524
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,240
Incorrect.

525
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,180
I got it.

526
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,660
'He's bad.'

527
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,400
He's been hearing that a lot.

528
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,100
'Are you all right?'

529
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,520
That was a powerful ball.

530
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,820
Wait! Time out!

531
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,240
That doesn't just make me feel down.
It damages me.

532
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,510
That's mean.

533
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,890
Should we just bury you in the ground?

534
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,130
- I just feel...
- Just bury him?

535
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,610
Se Yoon!

536
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,660
'Be strong.'

537
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,940
I actually heard that a lot.
It doesn't make me feel down, but...

538
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,140
I should be the one
to cheer people up.

539
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,480
But...

540
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,060
others say that to me to cheer me up so...

541
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,900
I feel sorry more than
down, to be honest.

542
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,250
I didn't feel down, but felt bad.

543
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,890
I was really feeling sorry.

544
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,590
'These days you are...'

545
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,450
- 'These days you are...'
- UEE!

546
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,140
'You are not funny these days.'

547
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,900
Incorrect!

548
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,580
Don't do that!

549
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,170
Se Yoon!

550
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,380
'These days...  you're not it.'

551
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:30,890
'These days...'

552
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,340
'What's wrong with you?'

553
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,820
I'm totally fine.

554
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,260
He's funny.

555
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,670
Okay, you are funny!

556
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,650
Hyun Joong!

557
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,340
'You are no good these days.'

558
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,950
Hyun Joong...

559
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,800
That even makes me feel down.

560
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,420
Ho Dong! Ho Dong!

561
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,060
Se Yoon!

562
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,760
If I say this, it'll really bring him down.

563
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,210
'These days you are...'

564
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,580
'These days you are... in danger.'

565
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,700
Correct!

566
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,680
- I feel sad.
- But it's not true.

567
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,580
I know. I am just fine.

568
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,980
What kind of danger?

569
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,630
When I see that news headline...

570
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,950
There are such headlines...

571
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,210
'Kang Ho Dong is in crisis...
real crisis...'

572
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,340
You are tearing up.

573
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,950
Because they keep saying
I'm having a crisis...

574
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,540
It makes me really feel down.

575
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,040
In your opinion, what are
you really having now?

576
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,870
For me, it's not a crisis... but...

577
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,920
it all depends how you look at it.

578
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:59,610
I had to stop and think about it.

579
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,030
I had to reflect on myself.

580
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,490
It's not the outcome,
but the process that's important.

581
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,410
I realized it.

582
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,340
And I realized I'm really
happy to be working on TV.

583
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,420
I learned that working as an
entertainer is my true happiness.

584
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,910
- This is a new chance for you.
- Not a crisis.

585
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,330
It's a perfect new start.

586
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,250
I see.

587
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,090
Hearing I'm in crisis makes me feel down.

588
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:35,060
The headline tomorrow will be
'Kang Ho Dong in denial about his crisis.'

589
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,950
That's not it.

590
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,710
'Kang Ho Dong still in a day dream.'

591
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,410
'Kang Ho Dong doesn't even
know he's in crisis.'

592
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,480
Now, Si Yoon!

593
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,840
What words would make him feel good?

594
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,670
'You are a good actor.'

595
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,640
That's nice, but incorrect.

596
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,110
Eunhyuk!

597
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,890
'You saved the show, Kim Tak Gu.'

598
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,040
Wow... that's...

599
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,320
Incorrect!

600
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,810
I think Si Yoon was nervous
about being on a variety show.

601
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,910
Eunhyuk!

602
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,260
'You are funny.'

603
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,460
Close...

604
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,120
Jong Shin! 'You have good sense.'

605
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,490
Correct!

606
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,790
How did that feel?

607
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,910
That really touched my heart.

608
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,890
- Has anyone said that to you?
- Not yet.

609
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:27,550
I said it because I thought
I would never say that again.

610
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,140
- But really...
- This was my first and last time saying it.

611
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,900
Ho Dong is the god of variety shows.

612
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,640
What do you think of him?

613
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,750
In my opinion, Si Yoon is...

614
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,800
the most proactive and hard working
celebrity I have seen on a variety show.

615
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,890
How are his prospects?

616
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,580
He will get better.

617
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,370
I hope he will get better.

618
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,680
I wish he could get better...

619
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:56,570
He needs to get better.

620
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,400
Okay, next!

621
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,090
What makes him feel down?

622
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,180
Jong Shin!

623
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,040
Am I getting it too fast?

624
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,370
'He's done nothing after Kim Tak Gu.'

625
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,850
Incorrect.

626
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,970
It's similar.

627
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,490
Se Yoon!

628
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,890
'You are already in crisis.'

629
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,940
Don't say that to anyone!

630
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,800
- UEE!
- Time out!

631
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,930
Is crisis a popular word these days?

632
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,540
- Crisis...
- Crisis Kang.

633
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,420
I think celebrities don't
like hearing this.

634
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,350
And their families don't like it either.

635
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,830
Se Yoon!

636
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,750
'What are you doing these days?'

637
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:42,910
Correct!

638
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,270
I was doing something.

639
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,970
You were doing something.

640
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,010
After Kim Tak Gu, I did two
more dramas and a movie...

641
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,740
and even a variety show now.

642
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,990
But people still call you Kim Tak Gu.

643
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,460
People still remember him as Kim Tak Gu.
The show was a big hit.

644
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:06,080
- I feel bad to my family...
- Even though you might be okay.

645
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:10,190
Sometimes people worry about you
for no reason.

646
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,820
- I heard that even while I was on it.
- As if it was a fleeting popularity...

647
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:19,490
My family and I worked hard to get there,
but people say it wouldn't last...

648
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,690
Like 'It won't last long.'

649
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:21,940
This is...

650
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,260
That is something we should
embrace as part of our work.

651
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,670
You will hear that a lot.

652
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,560
But I'm happier now.

653
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,920
All the praise I received
because of Kim Tak Gu...

654
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:39,650
made me happy, but also
I felt I was in debt.

655
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,840
I was like that before.

656
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,710
I was not self-congratulatory.

657
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,080
Even when I won a grand award,
I didn't know how to enjoy it.

658
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,180
I felt I was still lacking.

659
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,590
But then I realized...

660
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,940
There's something that only I can do.
Something that other singers can't do.

661
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,480
From the moment I started praising myself,
I became more confident and better.

662
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:04,390
You succeeded because you did a good job.

663
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,320
Judging from what I've seen so far,
Si Yoon is very pure.

664
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,430
He's pure. He's innocent.

665
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,470
Next is Eunhyuk.

666
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,650
What words would make Eunhyuk feel good?

667
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,710
He must hear lots of praises!

668
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,480
'Super Junior is nothing without Eunhyuk!'

669
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,620
You're right.

670
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,030
'You are better than Gyu Hyun.'

671
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,280
That makes me feel bad.

672
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,680
Just don't compare.

673
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,490
You are a gummy handsome man.

674
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,920
He's a gummy man!

675
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,170
He's handsome.

676
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,810
That's my complex,
so I don't bring it up myself.

677
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,990
You shouldn't feel that way.
Just smile big.

678
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,290
Se Yoon!

679
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,790
'I thought you were like a sardine...'

680
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,430
'but actually you are not!'

681
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,130
What's that?

682
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,990
Se Yoon!

683
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,890
'It can't be!'

684
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,440
What are you talking about?

685
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,630
'It can't be that you are a sardine!'

686
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,210
Not a sardine!

687
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,820
I will give you a hint.
It starts with 'you'.

688
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,560
Hyun Joong! 'You are my love.'

689
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,260
It feels weird hearing that from a man.

690
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,970
'You are mine.'

691
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:27,990
Correct!

692
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,020
Eunhyuk, what's that about?

693
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,070
- I like being straightforward.
- 'You are mine!'

694
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,610
You like proactive girls!

695
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,250
I like when they are
straightforward in a cute way.

696
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,200
UEE should show us what it's like.

697
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,690
You are mine from now on.

698
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,020
You are mine from now on.

699
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,270
I want to make you mine!

700
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,880
UEE was great.

701
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,380
That makes me feel good.

702
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,020
Your face is red.

703
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,020
I feel warm.

704
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,630
Such words make you feel flattered.

705
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,210
What makes him feel down?

706
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,710
- Be straightforward!
- Se Yoon!

707
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,900
'Gyu Hyun is better than you.'

708
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,480
UEE!

709
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,060
'You only dance when performing.'

710
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,010
Can't hear his voice!

711
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,430
That actually make me feel good.

712
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,880
I love dancing.

713
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,740
Hyun Joong! 'You are stingy.'

714
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,200
I got it!

715
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,230
'You are narrow-minded.'

716
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,890
Jong Shin! 'You look poor.'

717
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,480
Jong Shin!

718
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,140
'You are stale.'

719
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,860
Correct!

720
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,650
- Did you really hear that?
- You don't get that!

721
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,200
That's what musicians
hate hearing the most.

722
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,730
That's the worst.

723
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,620
- 'He lost it.'
- 'He's stale.'

724
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,930
UEE has a song with that title.

725
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:48,870
That would be the worst for
musicians to hear these days.

726
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,590
When did you hear that?

727
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,180
- I heard that expression about my looks.
- Really?

728
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:58,990
Since the other members on Super
Junior are all handsome...

729
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,320
People compare me to them a lot...

730
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,170
- 'Not fresh' is the worst.
- Like 'crisis'.

731
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,660
He hasn't overcome that yet.

732
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,440
Next is Jong Shin.

733
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,470
What makes him feel good
when he hears it?

734
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,580
UEE!

735
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,570
'You have a good wife!'

736
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,130
Nope!

737
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:25,030
'You don't look like a dad
with three daughters.'

738
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,320
Nice!

739
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,050
'You look young.'
Since I'm a man too...

740
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,090
- Have you ever heard that?
- I hear that a lot.

741
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,860
Incorrect! Si Yoon!

742
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,960
You are a true artist.

743
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,030
That's nonsense.

744
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,470
A true artist.

745
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,650
Eunhyuk!

746
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,350
'You last long.'

747
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,170
- What's that look?
- 'You last long?'

748
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:51,150
It's close. It's not just lasting.

749
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,700
'Last long and strong?'

750
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,310
- Long and strong?
- I've never heard that expression.

751
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,440
Last long and strong!

752
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,910
It's a hint.

753
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,450
What's opposite to thick and short?

754
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,450
Se Yoon!

755
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,440
'You will last thin and long.'

756
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,480
Correct!

757
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,310
That's what it was!

758
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,300
- Were you giving me a hint?
- But you didn't get it!

759
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,270
Does that make you feel good?

760
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,640
I like hearing that.

761
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,970
Because it can break easily
if it's too thick and straight.

762
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,380
I like the philosophy of being
soft and flexible.

763
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,080
I try to live that way.

764
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,030
What words make Jong Shin feel down?

765
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,910
It was too easy.

766
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,960
Don't have more to say? Say more!

767
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,020
Se Yoon!

768
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,100
You...

769
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,520
'Your music is...'

770
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,510
'outdated!'

771
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,530
Incorrect!

772
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,690
UEE! 'You are annoying!'

773
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,720
I like the sound of it.

774
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,510
Hyun Joong!

775
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,250
'You may not live long.'

776
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,230
How can you say that
with such a happy face?

777
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,150
I will live for a long time!

778
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,050
I think the answer you put down

779
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,250
is all wrong.

780
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,270
- Have you ever heard that?
- Yes.

781
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:23,480
- Really?
- Yes.

782
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:26,460
Three words after 'you.'

783
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,930
'You are not special.'

784
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:32,470
It's not nice to hear that from a woman.

785
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:34,890
Answer!

786
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,600
'You are too overactive.'

787
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:42,340
- There's a pattern here.
- Is that what I look like?

788
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,340
It's the perception of you.

789
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:48,800
In a large group, you tend to be this...

790
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,660
'Where were you?'

791
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,680
That's really close!

792
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:55,110
Eunhyuk!
'You were here?'

793
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,360
'You were here?'

794
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,110
Correct!

795
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,600
That's not true!

796
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,400
You have an obvious presence.

797
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,620
I know you're here just
by hearing your voice.

798
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:09,850
In a much larger group than this...

799
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,460
I tend to be silent.

800
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,260
- That's not true.
- My friends...

801
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,380
can't even pinpoint my weaknesses
because I'm invisible.

802
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,840
There's something to learn from Jong Shin.

803
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,800
He may not be like a shower
on a summer day.

804
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,730
But he's like soft rain
that comes down all day...

805
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,510
Soft rain that comes down all day...

806
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,520
A sudden sneeze like that
would stop a conversation about me...

807
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,770
and it'd become about something else.

808
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,380
Next is Se Yoon.

809
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,360
Nothing can really make him
feel down or feel good.

810
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,720
But he's tender inside.

811
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,580
'You are... sophisticated.'

812
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,790
Incorrect!

813
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,020
'You are humane. You have a warm heart!'

814
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,570
That's similar!

815
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:59,200
Make a face to deserve such comments!

816
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,860
UEE!

817
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,790
'You are cute.'

818
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,500
- It's getting close.
- Close?

819
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,940
'You are friendly.'

820
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,920
Incorrect! Look at his face!

821
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,150
Got it! 'You are loveable.'

822
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:16,110
Correct!

823
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,340
That's not right, Se Yoon.

824
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,280
I feel good when I hear it!

825
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,150
'You are adorable from head to toe'.

826
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,390
That was unexpected!

827
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:33,490
I can respond to other praise.

828
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,730
- But I can't with this one.
- Who said that to you?

829
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,700
- Well...
- Friends?

830
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,760
My ex-girlfriends... and my wife...

831
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,810
And even... younger guys...

832
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,880
His lips looked like this
when he said that.

833
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,500
'My wife and younger guys...'

834
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,590
One, two... three...

835
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,400
[Adorable lips...]

836
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,650
He has a feminine side.

837
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,770
He's really adorable.

838
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:07,080
Then what words would make him feel down?

839
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,250
Jong Shin!

840
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,840
'You are distasteful.'

841
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,340
Incorrect!

842
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,980
'Watch your mouth.'

843
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,510
Se Yoon isn't that strong a character.

844
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,430
He doesn't make harsh comments.

845
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,770
'Are you a pervert?'

846
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,660
'Are you a pervert?'

847
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,770
Yes, I am.

848
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,260
Incorrect!

849
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,650
'You are arrogant.'

850
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,110
I'm used to that.

851
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,160
He is a true professional.

852
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,760
Professional?
'You weren't funny this time.'

853
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,220
That was close.

854
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:41,960
- It's close?
- Close but far away.

855
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,350
It's really close.

856
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,700
'That wasn't good this time.'

857
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:46,830
Nope!

858
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,580
Actually, for variety show
amateurs like Si Yoon...

859
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:52,360
this would be a compliment.

860
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,860
But to pros like Ho Dong or Se Yoon

861
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,170
this would be an insult.

862
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,420
Se Yoon, this time you were...

863
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,250
'This time you were funny.'

864
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,980
Hyun Joong!

865
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,780
Correct!

866
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,320
'You were funny this time.'

867
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:17,100
When I hang out with my friends...

868
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:21,080
I would make a joke without
thinking too much.

869
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,600
And someone would say,
'You were funny this time.'

870
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,560
Like you weren't funny before?

871
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,870
That makes me think,
'Were you judging my jokes?'

872
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,230
I may be just chatting...

873
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,600
but people criticize my jokes
wherever I am.

874
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,360
He's sensitive.

875
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,580
He's really delicate.

876
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,630
You are pretty charming, Se Yoon.

877
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,120
And?

878
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,200
Adorable.

879
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,370
I don't know.

880
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,460
He sticks his tongue out.

881
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:51,980
I don't know.

882
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,360
Our female star, UEE!

883
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,820
What makes her feel good?

884
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,790
- Answer!
- Si Yoon!

885
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,810
'You are really a woman.'

886
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,210
Incorrect.

887
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:05,250
Jong Shin! 'UEE has the best body.'

888
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,590
- Why do you look at me?
- Is it not true?

889
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,970
Oh, well...

890
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,160
'Your legs are pretty.'

891
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,830
- Incorrect!
- Jong Shin!

892
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,780
'You are sexy.'

893
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:19,800
Incorrect.

894
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,460
- You are really pretty.
- Incorrect.

895
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,560
You look really pretty saying that.

896
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,800
You are pathetic.

897
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,360
I don't get to see handsome men these days.

898
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,710
I don't get to see them.

899
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,910
Don't think. Just say it.

900
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,380
'UEE, you are the most popular!'

901
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,450
It's very close.

902
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:53,570
'You are the best!'

903
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,090
Correct!

904
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:01,390
Do you really like that better
than you are pretty or sexy?

905
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:04,550
You should say it like,
'You are really the best!'

906
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,810
That's not it. They meant
you're the best athlete.

907
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,880
As an athlete...

908
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:15,090
Best athlete!

909
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:18,180
Just go do comedy with Gal Gal.

910
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,490
In everyone's eyes...

911
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,060
- It's obvious.
- So?

912
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,220
UEE, you are the best!

913
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,820
As an athlete!

914
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,620
As an athlete...

915
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,640
And there are words that
make even UEE feel down.

916
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:42,150
I've heard this so many times.

917
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,690
Got it!
'You are arrogant.'

918
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,150
He said it to UEE, but I feel the pain!

919
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:49,980
Hyun Joong!

920
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,540
'You don't look pretty in person.'

921
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,640
Incorrect!

922
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,690
Answer!
'You have broad shoulders.'

923
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,440
'UEE got the best shoulders!'

924
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:00,690
Incorrect!

925
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,220
Well...

926
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:07,140
Male idol stars may have said that to you.

927
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,360
'You must have lots of men!'

928
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:10,780
Incorrect.

929
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:12,140
Answer!

930
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,540
'You are not sexy.'

931
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,450
That really hurts my feeling.

932
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:24,580
Got it. 'You are a fox!'

933
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,950
He's shaking...

934
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:31,600
Jong Shin!

935
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,490
What is it now?

936
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,110
'Are you showing off?'

937
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,420
That must be close.

938
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:40,190
- Close but not exactly.
- Very close, Jong Shin.

939
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,370
Answer!

940
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:45,070
UEE is going to give you a hint.

941
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:47,600
Hey, hey.

942
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:50,520
Hey, hey, just go away.

943
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,630
Get lost!

944
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,600
Got it!

945
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:00,520
- I will show you!
- Stop that.

946
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:01,930
'Don't overdo it!'

947
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:03,870
Correct!

948
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:07,000
But UEE doesn't do that.

949
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,840
That really hurts me when
I'm just doing my best.

950
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,680
I got the answer because...

951
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:16,100
I see pretty girls hearing that a lot
no matter what they do.

952
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:19,440
That's true. They are jealous.

953
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,530
Yes, it's jealousy.

954
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,110
People can't stand it.

955
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:26,430
I'm just trying to do my best.

956
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,230
But when people say that,
I feel discouraged.

957
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:33,240
When I hear that,
I don't feel discouraged.

958
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,460
[It's raining. Time to go to sleep!]

959
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,770
[Ho Dong, who has no money for lodging]

960
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:47,150
[sleeps here.]

961
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,680
This is a crisis. This is not right.

962
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,680
No, no.

963
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,620
- Sleep here, Ho Dong.
- Where?

964
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,010
How about on the floor here?

965
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,360
- You want me to sleep inside?
- Come on in.

966
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,440
Ho Dong, why don't you come
in over here at least?

967
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:04,830
[Should I?]

968
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,150
<i>Come on in, it's raining!</i>

969
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:07,830
[Hyo Ri suddenly appears.]

970
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,080
[Ho Dong lies down at the sight of Hyo Ri.]

971
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:13,900
[I'm scared of Hyo Ri.]

972
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,930
Ho Dong!

973
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:21,460
- Should I sleep next to you?
- No.

974
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,230
You scared me.
My stomach hurts again!

975
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:28,440
- No, no!
