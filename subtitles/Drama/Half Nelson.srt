1
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,290
One, two, three,
four, five, six

2
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:08,033
Seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven, twelve

3
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:18,102
Okay.

4
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,324
- auditions for Miss Jackson
step rehearsals.

5
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:49,098
Step rehearsals will meet
in room 326 after school today.

6
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:07,354
Aww.

7
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,355
What is history?

8
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:10,629
Opposites.

9
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,098
You can read the board.

10
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,101
I'm so happy to hear that.

11
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,101
No, what is it?

12
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,102
What does it mean?
Stace?

13
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,105
Change?

14
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,367
Thank you, Stacey.

15
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,369
I'm glad to hear
someone's paying attention.

16
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:28,113
History is the study
Of change over time.

17
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,375
and what's change?

18
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,117
It's this.
It's opposites.

19
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,382
It's two things that push against
each other in opposite directions.

20
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,384
So the civil rights movement,
okay, it's essentially,

21
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,126
It's two opposing mentalities.

22
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:44,163
In the south,
the majority believes

23
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:45,391
All men are not created equal,
and there's a minority

24
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,394
Who believes that they are,
so that minority struggles

25
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:52,137
and it fights and it pushes
till eventually

26
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,400
It becomes the majority.

27
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,403
Am I boring you?
Huh?

28
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:02,147
Let's give you some examples,
okay, of opposing forces,

29
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,410
Like I'm going to go
night and day.

30
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,150
What else?

31
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,151
Big and little.

32
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,154
Good.
Anything else?

33
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,154
Left and right.

34
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,157
You and I.

35
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,160
You and I.

36
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,160
Teacher, student.
Anything else?

37
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,424
Yeah.

38
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,426
Just wondering if you could count me and
Gina's baldheaded sister as opposites.

39
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,168
Oh, insult.

40
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,434
Gina come on, tell me you're not
going to take that?

41
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:32,177
You got a bald sister?
Is your sister bald?

42
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,212
Give me something.

43
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,440
May 17, 1954.

44
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,183
Oh.

45
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,450
and I expect some thought
from you.

46
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,192
I don't want
just dates and facts.

47
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,194
I want to know why.
I want to know consequences.

48
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:52,197
I want to know what it means.
All right.

49
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,199
Now, back to the bald sister.

50
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,201
What's going on with that?

51
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,464
Right.

52
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,205
Left.
Back.

53
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,211
I'm shooting.

54
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,213
You got your girl open
over here.

55
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,475
She's sending out smoke signals
over here.

56
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,217
She's got the fire.

57
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,484
She's going I got it over here
and you're like-

58
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,260
Come on, get open.
Oh, yeah.

59
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,489
Drey?

60
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,231
You going to put that down
and come play or what?

61
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:30,497
I ain't done yet, Coach.

62
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,498
All right, top of the key,
three passes, here we go.

63
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:58,263
Thursday, 11:16 a. m.

64
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,526
Hello, this is Taylor calling
from Consolidated Credit.

65
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,266
This is an urgent message
For Mr. Daniel Dunn

66
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,529
Regarding your
outstanding balance.

67
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:09,274
Thursday, 5:25 p. m.

68
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:14,279
Hey, Dan, it's Rachel.
I'm in town for a while.

69
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:19,546
You know, my Mom, anyway,
I know it's been forever,

70
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,288
But i'd really like to see you.

71
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,290
I don't know.

72
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,553
I'll be at my parents
so give me a call, okay?

73
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,555
Bye.

74
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:34,561
Thursday, 5:25 p. m.

75
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,562
Hey, Dan, it's Rachel.

76
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,371
I like Oprah.

77
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,635
I love Oprah.

78
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,638
But the thing is I was just fucking
things up just to fuck them up.

79
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,380
Right, right.
No.

80
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:56,378
Right.

81
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,642
Yeah.

82
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,387
Right, because everything
that is worth-

83
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,387
Right, just forget it.
so you're a teacher?

84
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:12,660
I'm a teacher.

85
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,400
and what am I supposed To teach
them, you know what I mean?

86
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,403
Right.

87
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,403
That's the point,
you know what I mean?

88
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,404
Yeah.

89
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,406
Yeah.

90
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,670
If you can change one person-

91
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,672
Then you can change them all.

92
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,411
I want to dance.

93
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,415
I want to dance.

94
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:39,721
Let's dance.

95
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,481
What's going on, bro?

96
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,710
What's the word?

97
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,452
What's that?

98
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,454
What, this right here?
Mm-hmm.

99
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,717
Some new street shit.

100
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:21,729
Go ahead, man, check it out.

101
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:25,470
You got to feel that shit.

102
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:26,729
Yeah, it's not bad.

103
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,738
That's the street shit.

104
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,479
So what you need, teach,
another eighth?

105
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,742
I only got 30.

106
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,744
Word.

107
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,486
It's been a long week.

108
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:47,754
You want that other thing?

109
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:52,497
On may 17, 1954,
The supreme court ruled

110
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,760
On the case of Brown
versus Board of Education,

111
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,503
Making it illegal for states
to segregate public schools.

112
00:08:58,605 --> 00:08:59,765
This was a major step forward
in the struggle

113
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,768
For racial justice
and helped begin

114
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,510
A flurry of bold
and heroic actions

115
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:15,544
Known as
the Civil Rights Movement.

116
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,534
Get on her.
Sally, get on her.

117
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:39,568
It's all right, Sally.
Come on.

118
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,833
Come on.

119
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:17,606
Ballgame, ladies.
Ballgame.

120
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:41,869
Okay.
Good job.

121
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,872
I like our chances
Against Saint Joseph.

122
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,611
The thing is if we could just
Figure out a way to put the ball

123
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,875
In the hoop it would be fine.

124
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,618
Stace, good job tonight.

125
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:54,880
Thank you.

126
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:56,882
You did a greatjob.
Is there anyone else in there?

127
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,624
No, that's it.

128
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:00,624
Thanks for tonight.

129
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:06,495
All right.
Bye, Mr. Dunn.

130
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,903
What are you doing here?

131
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:23,648
I heard this was the place.

132
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:27,652
We need a little work,
But we're having fun so, yeah.

133
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,659
How are you?

134
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,923
Same old, same old.

135
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,664
I'm happy to see you.

136
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:44,931
It's good to see you too.
You look good.

137
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,673
Come on, I got fat.

138
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:58,673
Oh, I know, but it looks great.
You look healthy.

139
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,945
Do you want to go get some-

140
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,948
I can't.
I got to-

141
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:04,950
To get some coffee?

142
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:06,952
Yeah.

143
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,957
I can't tonight.

144
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,959
Do you want to do it
Another night?

145
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:23,970
Okay.

146
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:34,743
Hey, how's your Mom?

147
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:45,754
Did you get my messages?

148
00:12:53,806 --> 00:13:03,010
Hello?
I'm coming in.

149
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:13,782
Anyone?

150
00:14:55,928 --> 00:15:05,894
Somebody in there?

151
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,886
Oh, sorry.

152
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:29,156
That's okay.

153
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:35,901
It's okay.
I'm fine.

154
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:41,167
I'm sorry.

155
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:46,172
Are you okay?

156
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:56,945
Can you help me up?

157
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,199
Are you okay?

158
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,940
Yeah.

159
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:20,945
Okay, good.

160
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:29,216
It's gonna be fine.

161
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:38,953
Some water?

162
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:48,997
I'm sorry, but I'm fine.

163
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:12,258
Just don't go, okay,
Just for a minute?

164
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:16,262
Just for a minute?

165
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:49,092
See you tomorrow?

166
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:43,208
Hey, kiddo.

167
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,470
How's darrel's leg healing?

168
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,472
I don't know.

169
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,475
You didn't go to the hospital?

170
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,480
No.

171
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,221
Did your father pick you up
from practice last night, Drey?

172
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,224
No.

173
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,487
Fucking shit.
How did you get home?

174
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,231
Coach.

175
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:10,234
I'm tired of this.
Something has got to change.

176
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,496
I don't know what.

177
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:16,502
You don't got to worry about me.

178
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,503
Oh, look at you, Miss 12.

179
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,505
Thirteen, I'm 13 now.

180
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:24,248
Oh, so you grown, huh?

181
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,250
Going to take care of yourself,
Is that it?

182
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,513
Pretty much.

183
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:30,310
Well, that's a relief.

184
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:39,263
I guess I ain't got to cook up
these burgers then, huh?

185
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,526
Hey, Mom, you know this dude
Cesar Chavez on Spanish Six?

186
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,528
Cesar who?

187
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:48,272
Cesar Chavez.
He once fasted for 35 days.

188
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:51,275
That means he didn't eat
For 35 days,

189
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,538
Mm-hmm.

190
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,278
Think you could do that?

191
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,554
Hi, honey, it's Mom.

192
00:22:53,439 --> 00:23:01,346
Hello?
Hi, um, is Rachel there?

193
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,369
Well, I feel good today.

194
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,634
Anyone else feel good?
Hmm?

195
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:34,640
I need a volunteer, and I need
somebody who feels strong.

196
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,382
So what we've got here
Is two opposing forces,

197
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,385
Terrence and myself, and we're
pushing against each other.

198
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:43,648
and as long as one is stronger-
and it looks like it's t-

199
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:48,392
The change is slow
and consistent.

200
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:51,190
But once the other side
becomes stronger,

201
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,662
There's a turning point.

202
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,664
Thank you, T.
Make sense?

203
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,666
Okay.

204
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,409
Now, turning points
can happen like that.

205
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:14,442
They can be physical, or they
can happen on a greater scale,

206
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:16,681
Like a war or something.

207
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:20,686
So why don't you do me
a favor and write

208
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,427
Three examples
Of historical turning points

209
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:31,698
That we've talked about
in class, okay?

210
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,699
What's up?

211
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:45,473
Have you even opened the
Civil Rights binder I gave you?

212
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:54,448
The Civil Rights binder
I have opened,

213
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,461
and it's got some great stuff
in it.

214
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:00,464
I think it's great.
Yeah.

215
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:01,726
I'm just providing
a little general content-

216
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:06,732
I need you on the civil rights
Section by next week.

217
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:08,471
Nice seeing you.

218
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:18,506
Is that gum in your mouth?

219
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,757
He was a Gemini.
He was so cocky.

220
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:35,499
Every day I saw him he used to
go like, oh, you happy you got me.

221
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:36,761
You happy you got me,
and I be like,

222
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,764
Please you the one that's got
me, so y'all like Geminis?

223
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,506
Oh, what's his name?

224
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,769
Mr. Easton and Mrs. Wright
In the movie theater.

225
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:46,771
I'm pretty sure they're married. No.

226
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:48,773
I don't, they can't.

227
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:50,513
You don't know what you're
talking about, so don't talk.

228
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:51,514
No, but they look
weird together.

229
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:52,515
Y'all think Mr. Dunn is married?

230
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,520
Would you want to marry him?

231
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:57,520
Come in the room,
swirling his finger around,

232
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:58,521
Telling us to move the desk.

233
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,524
Why can't he move the desk?

234
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,526
I'm getting tired of that
every morning.

235
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:03,788
Don't forget about his glasses.

236
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:05,790
and he-
- bifocals.

237
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,795
- he start Throwing them
around, throwing the chalk

238
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,569
Like he all cool and fly
and everything, but-

239
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:12,216
Ridley?

240
00:26:12,251 --> 00:26:12,795
Quiet.

241
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,541
Would you marry your father?
Oh.

242
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,543
"a man who was curious to know
If a knife could penetrate

243
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:20,805
"his bulletproof vest
Was killed yesterday

244
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:22,545
"by a stab wound to the chest.

245
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,809
"witnesses say the man,
Jeff Turner, 32,

246
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:31,556
"urged his brother,
Scott Turner, 35, to stab him

247
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:35,821
"as hard as he could, believing
The vest would stop the knife.

248
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:44,831
It didn't. "

249
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,832
So how's
Your opposite somethings?

250
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,574
Pretty good.

251
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,837
Where'd you come up
with that stuff?

252
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:54,839
It's just a little something
I picked up in college.

253
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:56,841
A little thick
for the eighth grade, no?

254
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:58,843
Yeah, yeah, well, you'd think,
but I don't know.

255
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,848
I think they're getting it.

256
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:08,592
You know,
Drey is so textbook.

257
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:10,855
How's your book?

258
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,858
Don't ask.

259
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,600
There's always the summer.

260
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:17,600
Do you want to go?

261
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:22,867
You want to have dinner
with me again?

262
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:26,872
Okay.
Mm-hmm?

263
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,613
Did you guys hear
that they found

264
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:30,875
A crack vial in the locker room?

265
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,878
Jesus.

266
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:35,880
Hmm.

267
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:40,624
Whose it is?
Oh, I don't know.

268
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,887
Hey, you know what?
That's a good idea.

269
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:44,889
We can put it in the lost and
found to see if anybody claims it.

270
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:55,663
Better yet, why don't we put up
flyers with a picture?

271
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:06,649
What's new?

272
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:08,913
I don't know.

273
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:15,660
I can't hear you.
Come over here.

274
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,695
That's a nice cap.

275
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:18,923
Thanks.
It's Mike's.

276
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:24,668
Yeah, I know.
Talk to him lately?

277
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,931
He writes sometimes.

278
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,673
How's he doing in there?

279
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,675
All right, I guess.

280
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,677
Well, if he needs something,
Let me know, all right?

281
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:34,939
I mean, I know people in there.

282
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,683
Okay.

283
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,685
Okay?

284
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:42,685
Yeah.

285
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:51,685
All right then.

286
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:56,700
What, you thirsty, huh?
You want something to drink?

287
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:57,962
My bike.

288
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:06,973
Ain't nobody going
to fuck with that bike.

289
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:11,715
Yo Harvey, this is Drey.
Hey, Tina?

290
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:12,977
You remember Mike's
little sister, Drey, right?

291
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:14,752
Oh, hey, sweetie.

292
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,983
Come and sit down.
Let me get thatjuice for you.

293
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,985
Help yourself.
Come on and sit.

294
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:31,759
I'll be right back.

295
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:10,035
Yo, pick a hand.

296
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:16,780
Ha, you lose.

297
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:18,782
Come on.
What's up with thatjuice?

298
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,045
I'm not thirsty.

299
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,787
Well, don't be a stranger, kid.

300
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,049
You could stop through
and say hello.

301
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:35,823
Yeah.

302
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,067
You saw Frank today?

303
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:53,841
Just ran into him.

304
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:16,101
On September 13, 1971,
1200 Attica state prison inmates

305
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:18,102
Seized control of the prison
and took hostages

306
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:23,108
To negotiate changes
to their inhumane conditions.

307
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,110
Governor Nelson Rockefeller
ordered a military assault

308
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:30,854
On the prison which killed
29 inmates and 10 hostages,

309
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:33,117
Every one caused
from police gunshots.

310
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:36,860
An official commission later
Stated, with the exception

311
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,123
Of indian massacres
In the late 19th century,

312
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,866
The police assault was
the bloodiest one-day encounter

313
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:45,869
Between Americans
Since the civil war.

314
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:41,925
Unbelievable.
What are you doing?

315
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:49,923
Go sit in the desk.
Ten points off.

316
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,936
Second chances are rare, man.

317
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:56,940
You ought to take
better advantage of them.

318
00:32:57,008 --> 00:33:01,206
Don't let go.
Grab the t-shirt if you need to.

319
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,948
You know, a little elbow here
and there never killed anybody,

320
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:05,209
You know what I mean?

321
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:10,215
As long as the ref
isn't looking.

322
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,990
Not in my house.

323
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,252
It's a nice surprise.
Where's Mom?

324
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,254
Working.

325
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,257
Darrel's uncle came to visit
so I came along with him.

326
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,259
How's Darrel's leg?

327
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,262
It's all right.

328
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,267
It's nice to see you.

329
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:06,271
Those for me?

330
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:08,010
Frank's for sending me
some of them nasty peppermints

331
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,011
He always eating.

332
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,274
What is that?

333
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:17,021
I threw them shits out.

334
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,055
So how's the team?

335
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:20,284
We suck.

336
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:24,027
and Ma,
still working too hard?

337
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:25,289
Yeah.

338
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:29,032
But she all right
for money though.

339
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,035
Frank still looking out?

340
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,299
Good.

341
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:41,306
He owes us.

342
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,308
So how come
you never told on him?

343
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:49,052
For what?

344
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,314
Would've made shit
more complicated.

345
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:57,322
and shit was already fucked up
as it is, you know?

346
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,324
That's all in the past, though.

347
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:04,329
I'm going to get out of here.
You'll see.

348
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:08,071
I mean, you got Russell Simmons
On the case.

349
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:14,339
Russell Simmons?

350
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:20,083
Look, we'll be all right.

351
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,353
I have to write
an essay about growing up.

352
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,356
I'm going to fail the course.

353
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,359
Well, that's your problem,
Charles.

354
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,099
My problem is making sure
that you keep an eye on things

355
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:38,362
While I'm gone.

356
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,365
Actually that's also
your problem.

357
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,105
You've got a lot
Of problems, Charles.

358
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:49,374
Don't let them get
in the way of your work.

359
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:53,116
There's a time when
the operation of the machine

360
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:56,153
Becomes so odious,
makes you so sick at heart

361
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,381
That you can't take part.

362
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,124
You can't even passively
take part, and you've got

363
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,387
To put your bodies upon
the gears and upon the wheels,

364
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,390
Upon the levers,
upon all the apparatus

365
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:10,133
and you've got to make it stop,
and you've got to indicate

366
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,395
to the people who run it,
to the people who own it

367
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,397
that unless you're free,
the machine will be prevented

368
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:17,140
from working at all.

369
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,803
What is this machine
that he's talking about?

370
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:22,735
It's keeping us down.
What is it?

371
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:26,149
Like robots and stuff, right?

372
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,412
It could be robots.

373
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,155
It could be robots,
but let's say it's a metaphor.

374
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:33,417
He's saying this machine
is keeping me down.

375
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,420
Now, what is that?
What keeps us from being free?

376
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:39,162
Ms. Drey?

377
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,425
Prisons.

378
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:46,169
Absolutely, absolutely.
Prisons, okay?

379
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,169
Prisons are definitely
a part of it.

380
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,174
White.

381
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,177
The man.

382
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,213
The school, exactly.

383
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,440
The whole education system
is part of the machine.

384
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,443
What else?

385
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,445
Aren't you the machine then?

386
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,448
Oh, no, you didn't.
What'd you say?

387
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:05,449
Aren't you the machine?

388
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,451
You're saying I'm the machine?

389
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,454
Yeah, you're white.
You're part of the school.

390
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,456
Oh, yeah,
I guess you got a point.

391
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,458
All right,
so I'm part of the machine,

392
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,200
But if I'm part of it
so are you.

393
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,202
You are, too.
we all are.

394
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:22,466
Everything is made
with opposing force.

395
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,208
We may be opposed
to the machine,

396
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:27,471
But we're still very much
a part of it, right?

397
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:31,214
I work for the government,
the school, but I'm also

398
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:32,476
very much opposed
to a lot of its policies.

399
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,219
Yes.

400
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:44,227
Sometimes, exactly.

401
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,234
Where you headed?

402
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:52,234
You look like you're in a rush. Hungry?

403
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:56,239
I'm starving.

404
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,242
Come on.
Burger's on me.

405
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,504
So how's school?

406
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,246
It's hard.

407
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:05,247
I got a game tomorrow.

408
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:09,514
Word.

409
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,515
Want to come?

410
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:14,256
Working.

411
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,520
Pops?

412
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:18,260
Fuck it.
I'll come through.

413
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:24,529
Somebody got to represent.

414
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:30,273
Tina packed some sweets
For Mike last night.

415
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:34,539
Your brother was a good friend,
still is.

416
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:37,541
That dude was funny.

417
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,283
I mean, he ever showed you
the chicken walk?

418
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,545
The what?

419
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:48,291
I mean, I can't do it,
But it's like-

420
00:38:53,364 --> 00:39:01,294
- shit was bananas.

421
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:05,570
You know, we used
to work together, right?

422
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:14,580
You ever think about working?

423
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,580
Shit.
I used to work here.

424
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,583
For real?

425
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:25,328
$150 a week.
Hey, Keesha?

426
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:26,328
What's up, hon?

427
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,661
We need two milkshakes, baby.

428
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,357
I know I don't sound sincere,
but I mean it.

429
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,356
Thank you.

430
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:57,359
I think I-

431
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,623
Why can't I say that sincerely?

432
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,626
Oh, you can.
I went back to school.

433
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:04,628
Mm-hmm.

434
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:06,425
Environmental Policy.

435
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,368
No, I know, but I think
you're really going to be great.

436
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,373
I believed you
the first time.

437
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:14,377
I'm just nervous that's all.

438
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:15,639
How are you?

439
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:19,382
I don't know.

440
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,648
You still rocking out?

441
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:31,384
When the occasion calls.

442
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:41,428
Yeah.

443
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,411
Who's the lucky guy?

444
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:54,679
I met him in the program.

445
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:58,683
I don't know, Dan.

446
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,424
Some people change.
Some people actually change.

447
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,427
I know.

448
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:06,691
No way.
I'm still an asshole.

449
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:13,698
You're not an asshole.
You're just a big baby.

450
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:20,705
I'm a big asshole baby.

451
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,463
Let's go, rebels.

452
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:44,467
Pass it in.

453
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,469
All right, there you go.

454
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:47,731
Blue ball.

455
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:49,733
What is that?
You're killing us.

456
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:51,473
You need to watch yourself.
Another bad call, hear?

457
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,736
Blue ball.

458
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,478
Walk it off, baby, Walk it
off. Come on, shake it off.

459
00:41:55,546 --> 00:42:00,483
Hustle back.

460
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:10,517
That was a bad call, man.

461
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,497
You okay?

462
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:22,768
Yeah.

463
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:26,771
You want a ride home tonight
after the game?

464
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:37,544
All right.

465
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,788
Foul, foul, call the foul.

466
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:45,527
Coach, go back to your bench.

467
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:47,529
Go back to your bench.

468
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:48,530
Call the foul.
Call it.

469
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,532
Call the foul.

470
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:51,533
This is fucking bullshit
and you know it.

471
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:53,535
You're gone, coach.

472
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:55,799
I won't tolerate that language
on my court.

473
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:57,539
Oh, it's the language
you don't tolerate,

474
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:58,540
Fucking language, excuse me.

475
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:05,549
I didn't know it was
the language.

476
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:15,582
All right.
Good luck, girls.

477
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:19,824
I think your hand is changing
colors get more ice on it.

478
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:23,566
You should've seen the wall.

479
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:24,828
I'm telling you, Dunn, you
should've knocked that nigga out.

480
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:28,833
You can't go around
knocking people out, you know,

481
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,575
Or throwing balls at them
just because you're upset.

482
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:33,575
It would've felt good,
though, right,

483
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:35,839
Felt good to just get it out.

484
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:37,841
There's other ways
of getting it out.

485
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:43,848
Right.
Like you do?

486
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:49,592
Look, just because you know
that one thing about me,

487
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:59,626
One thing doesn't make a man.

488
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:03,606
What?

489
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:07,872
One thing doesn't make a man?

490
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:09,873
You know I was just talking
about your hand right?

491
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,615
Yeah.

492
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:19,612
Yeah, I knew that.

493
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:24,627
Hey, who was that guy
that was cheering for you?

494
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:25,889
Do you know him?

495
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:30,895
Not really.
Do you?

496
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:36,639
No.

497
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:37,639
So we can just keep the whole
punching the wall thing

498
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:38,902
A secret, right?

499
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:49,676
You don't have to tell anybody,
right?

500
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:16,738
What's up, Santa Claus?
Where you going?

501
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:57,710
I had a good day.

502
00:45:57,788 --> 00:45:59,722
Even after the dolphin report,
right?

503
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,985
Even after it says
there are no weapons.

504
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:05,728
There are no WMD programs.
There is nothing.

505
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:06,728
They do that,
The Pippa study,

506
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:07,991
That University
Of Maryland thing,

507
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,994
and turns out 72 percent
Of his supporters

508
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:14,999
Still believe there's WMDs.

509
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:19,742
Seventy-five percent
still believe they're supporting

510
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:24,008
Al Qaeda and so what
the fuck do we do you know?

511
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:26,009
What do you do?

512
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:29,752
What does one, I'm one man,
what I do, you know?

513
00:46:29,854 --> 00:46:32,015
I used to be so fucked up.

514
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,757
I used to be so fucked up
I was just out there, you know,

515
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:37,760
But I fucking cleaned up.

516
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:46,031
I cleaned up-

517
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:47,769
For the most part.

518
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:49,772
I do it now to get by,
but I can handle it.

519
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,775
You know what I mean?

520
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:54,777
I tried the rehab thing.
I tried it.

521
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,780
It didn't work.
It didn't work.

522
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:02,046
You know,
it works for some people.

523
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:12,819
My ex-girlfriend
is getting married.

524
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:17,060
So it works for some people,
right?

525
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,802
It didn't work for me.

526
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:27,072
The kids keep me focused,
and I-

527
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:19,556
Number three: Change moves
in spirals, not circles.

528
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:26,868
For example, the sun goes up
and then it comes down,

529
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:31,874
But every time that happens
what do you get?

530
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:41,146
You get a new day.
You get a new one.

531
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:47,151
When you breathe, you inhale
and then you exhale,

532
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:51,894
But every single time
that you do that

533
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:56,899
You're a little bit different
than the one before.

534
00:48:56,967 --> 00:49:01,904
We're always changing,
and it's important to know

535
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:04,167
That there are some changes
you can't control

536
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:07,910
But that there are others
you can.

537
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:17,920
Any students who did not turn
in their Hall of Science

538
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:20,923
Field trip permission slips must
do so by the end Of the week.

539
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:22,185
Hall of Science Permission
slips are due in the main office

540
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:30,923
By friday afternoon.
Thank you.

541
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,936
Hi.

542
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:36,199
How come you're not eating
with the teachers?

543
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:39,942
Just...

544
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:43,946
I felt like being alone.

545
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:45,208
I know what you mean.

546
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:48,951
You do?

547
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:56,949
Mm-hmm.

548
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:58,995
All right, Mr. Dunn,
I'll see you later.

549
00:49:59,063 --> 00:50:02,226
Enjoy your lunch.

550
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:05,968
Thank you.

551
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:08,231
Oh, yeah, do you think
I could get a ride home later?

552
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:17,242
Okay?

553
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:21,984
Okay.

554
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:35,258
All right.

555
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:40,002
Thanks for the ride.

556
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,264
Okay.
Have a good weekend.

557
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:53,039
Bye.

558
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:10,293
Yo.

559
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:12,295
I lost my key.

560
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:16,038
What do we do?

561
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,074
I don't know.

562
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:20,303
She's an E.M.T.

563
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:26,048
I could page her,
but I don't know.

564
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:28,311
All right, get in.

565
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:44,056
What's up, y'all?
You want some candy?

566
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:45,066
That's all you got?

567
00:51:45,169 --> 00:51:48,332
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
So where your bike at?

568
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:50,333
They stole it.

569
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:52,335
They who?

570
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:57,079
I don't know.
I'm going to find out though.

571
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:59,342
So what, man.
Y'all just chilling?

572
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:05,349
She lost my key-her key.

573
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:08,090
So what, Drey, what?

574
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,093
No, man, we're cool.

575
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:12,093
Are you cool, Drey?

576
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:17,099
Mm-hmm.

577
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,101
All right.

578
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:25,368
What, you don't know him, huh?

579
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:29,373
Who, Frank?

580
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,375
Frank?

581
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:35,117
I thought you said
you didn't know him.

582
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:36,379
Just a guy from
the neighborhood.

583
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:42,124
You know what he does?

584
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:45,389
Look, I know that I'm
the last person

585
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:51,395
That should be saying this.

586
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:59,404
You don't have
to worry about me.

587
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:09,414
Okay, let me-
Just give me a sec.

588
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:20,152
Wait.

589
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:30,196
Okay.

590
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:33,174
Have a seat.

591
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:37,441
You can watch tv if you want.

592
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:44,448
Make yourself at home.

593
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:49,191
You got them old things?

594
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:51,193
Records?

595
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:52,455
Yeah.

596
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:57,199
Yeah, little Miss mp3,
I got records.

597
00:53:57,267 --> 00:54:07,233
You should check them out.
You might learn something.

598
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:16,252
Who's this?

599
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,480
My parents and my brother.

600
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:20,222
Do they still live together?

601
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:24,488
Yeah.

602
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:28,230
Why you got so many books
about black people?

603
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:30,493
I got books
about all kinds of people.

604
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:37,501
Can I borrow one?

605
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:41,243
Yeah.

606
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:46,248
Who's she?

607
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:47,510
Just an old friend.

608
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:51,253
What happened to her?

609
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:54,256
Oh, well, you should
mind your business.

610
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:58,522
You put it up there.

611
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:01,263
I've seen her before.

612
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:06,530
She was at the game
that night, right?

613
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:13,537
Yeah.

614
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:19,543
You need help in here?

615
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,284
Do you like to cook?

616
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:28,552
Yeah, sometimes, mostly just
for special occasions.

617
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,554
You got a lady
coming over tonight or what?

618
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:34,296
Yeah.

619
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:35,558
You must like her a lot.

620
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:37,560
Yeah, she's all right.

621
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:40,302
She like you?

622
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,565
I don't know.
I'm hard to like sometimes.

623
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:44,305
That's true.

624
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:49,311
Oh.

625
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:50,573
Oh, yeah, you just got to,
you mash those up.

626
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:52,313
You mash them up
with your hands.

627
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:54,577
Get in there and squeeze them.

628
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:58,320
See, what you need is some
jokes. Women love jokes.

629
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:01,585
Okay.
You got any?

630
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:03,586
What do you call cheese
that's not yours?

631
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:09,329
Nacho cheese.

632
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,595
Absolutely not.

633
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:21,606
That's a funny joke.
Thank you.

634
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:24,345
Yeah.

635
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:25,346
Can I ask you something?

636
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:34,619
Mm-hmm.

637
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:43,628
What's it like
when you smoke that stuff?

638
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:46,368
Sorry.

639
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:56,436
No, don't be.
It's all right.

640
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:15,659
Mash them up.

641
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:23,395
Hope you have
a nice date, Mr. Dunn.

642
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:30,402
Hey, thanks for the joke.

643
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,675
So my buddy gets in the car
and the cab driver's like,

644
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:34,677
I'm so sorry I'm late, sir.

645
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:38,420
I had to kill somebody
On the way here, you know.

646
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:39,455
and he's like, what?

647
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:42,686
He's like, oh, yeah
I kill him, I kill him.

648
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:46,428
and he's like, what do you,
You, you killed him?

649
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:49,692
I'm killing people,
you know, anybody

650
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,694
Who really kind of mouth off
to me, I fucking kill them, man.

651
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:55,699
Turns out he thinks "kill" is
the word for "punch," right?

652
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:01,443
My friend thinks
that he's killing them.

653
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,706
He's terrified and he thinks that
the word for "cement" is "semen. "

654
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:05,481
So he's like well, basically

655
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:07,710
stepping on semen.

656
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:10,713
There's semen everywhere.
There's semen buildings.

657
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:14,718
It's lot of people, you know, so
everything is made of semen, you know.

658
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:22,727
I didn't say every day.
You're her father.

659
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:24,727
Today she got locked out
the house.

660
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:19,843
Are you a communist?

661
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:24,848
What?

662
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:29,591
"Ohe in Africa"?

663
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:31,593
So?

664
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:39,864
"The Communist Manifesto?"

665
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:45,607
If I had a copy of "Mein Kampf"
Would that make me a Nazi?

666
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:50,874
You know, this is really good,
very tasty.

667
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:58,883
You should try it warm.

668
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:00,678
Well, you don't have
a copy of of "Mein Kampf"

669
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:04,886
But if you did, then yes,
I'd ask you if you were a Nazi.

670
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:06,889
Maybe I'm hiding it.

671
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:10,632
Why would you hide it?

672
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:20,701
'Cause it's just not cool
To be a Nazi anymore, baby.

673
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:28,911
So what are you doing today?

674
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:33,655
Oh, I got to-

675
01:01:33,757 --> 01:01:34,917
It's great you're writing.

676
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:41,664
Yeah, we'll see.

677
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:42,925
I should let you get to it then.

678
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:44,927
Yeah, thanks though.
I had a good time.

679
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:55,701
Yeah, me too.

680
01:01:58,782 --> 01:02:01,945
On November 1, 1977,
Harvey Milk was elected

681
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:04,686
To the San Francisco
City Council.

682
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:05,948
He was the first
Openly gay person

683
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:08,951
To ever be elected
To public office.

684
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:11,693
A year later he was
assassinated by another member

685
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:13,956
Of the City Council
Called Dan White.

686
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:16,698
- reports that Harvey Milk
have been shot and killed.

687
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:18,700
Dan White claimed he shot Milk
because he ate

688
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:20,963
too much junk food that day.

689
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:24,968
This would later be known
As the twinkie defense.

690
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:27,709
Is that for real?

691
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:58,061
Drey, Drey, come here.
Where are you going?

692
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:00,062
Home.

693
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,804
I'll give you a ride home.

694
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:04,066
That's cool.
I got a ride.

695
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:05,808
I don't really think you should
be riding with him, do you think?

696
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:09,811
Drey, is everything cool?

697
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:10,811
Everything's okay.
I'm going to take her home.

698
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,812
Is that right?

699
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,815
Yeah.

700
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:15,817
Is that right, D, huh,
you getting a ride with teach?

701
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:16,852
No, man.

702
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:20,083
Drey, Drey, Drey, come here.
Everything's fine.

703
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,824
Have a nice night.

704
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:24,826
I'm going to take her home,
Okay?

705
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:26,088
Hey, look, man, you know what,
let me introduce myself, huh?

706
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:29,091
I'm Frank.

707
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:31,833
Come here now, okay?

708
01:04:31,935 --> 01:04:33,095
Come here.
Come here.

709
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:38,839
Come on.

710
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:39,840
Did I hurt you?

711
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:44,107
We'll see you later, Teach.
Come on.

712
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:04,127
Dunn, right?
Lloyd Dixon.

713
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:07,129
My daughter Paula went
To Jefferson, Paula Dixon.

714
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:10,132
You taught history, right?

715
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,135
Paula Dixon?

716
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:16,878
She's in her first semester
At Georgetown, history major.

717
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:23,875
Paula Dixon.

718
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:29,152
You have a good night.

719
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:39,925
Dave?

720
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:50,936
Dave?

721
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:08,920
In asia the idea that things
are made of opposites,

722
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:10,192
Ying and Yang,
dates back 3,000 years.

723
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,197
That was them saying change
is the only constant,

724
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:16,938
But thatjust died in the west.

725
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:19,941
Itjust couldn't be both,
couldn't be black and white.

726
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:23,206
It would be right and wrong.
It had to be one or the other.

727
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:25,947
Who am I to say
that aristotle is wrong, right,

728
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:28,210
but that doesn't make any sense.

729
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,212
These things need each other.

730
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:36,219
The idea that all
God's creations are "perfect"-

731
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:44,228
So just to suggest that a tree,
it's crooked and it's straight,

732
01:06:45,034 --> 01:06:47,229
It's strong
and it's weak, is to suggest

733
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:50,972
That god created
something imperfect.

734
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,235
They do however
acknowledge it in people.

735
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:57,979
We are sinners, but we can
strive to be good,

736
01:06:58,047 --> 01:07:05,977
Just not in nature itself,
I guess.

737
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:09,252
Oh, i've got to go.

738
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:19,263
You guys write down
what's on the board.

739
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:22,003
"Broward County Florida
Middle schools mistakenly

740
01:07:22,105 --> 01:07:25,268
"failed over 6500 students
In June due to what

741
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:28,270
"later called a computer error.

742
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:34,277
"a school official called the
total count of students affected

743
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:45,050
An insignificant sum. "

744
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:53,035
What goes, Danny boy?
How's history?

745
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:55,070
I can't do it anymore.

746
01:07:55,138 --> 01:07:58,039
Oh, I know the feeling.

747
01:07:58,107 --> 01:07:59,301
Hang in there.
Things will get better.

748
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:10,041
And if not,
There's always summer.

749
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:20,085
Don't you have class right now?

750
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:23,064
Look, look, look,
that's him over there.

751
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:25,066
That ain't even
your bike, though.

752
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:26,066
That's my bike.

753
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:28,364
There he go right there.

754
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:31,072
He a little round one too.

755
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,072
This my bike, nigger.

756
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:35,337
What the fuck you doing
on my bike?

757
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:38,078
You ain't know it was mines?

758
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:39,079
What you mean
you ain't know it was mines?

759
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:41,082
You always see me on this bike.

760
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,082
Sorry.

761
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:46,087
I just didn't know
it was your bike.

762
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:49,352
You hella sorry, nigger.
I should fuck you up.

763
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:56,359
Get off my bike.

764
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:00,362
I thought you
Was going fuck him up?

765
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:02,364
Didn't have to.

766
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:06,107
Oh, shit, okay,
you didn't have to.

767
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:48,208
Hey.

768
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:53,416
Hey.

769
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:56,418
It's back.

770
01:09:57,226 --> 01:10:02,425
Yeah.

771
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:04,426
Did you know my brother?

772
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:10,194
I knew of him, but I didn't,
you know.

773
01:10:10,273 --> 01:10:18,180
He wasn't in any of my classes
or anything.

774
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:24,447
You think I could end up
like him?

775
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:35,220
Do you?

776
01:10:58,321 --> 01:11:01,484
He's got a 7-Up in his
Mother fucking-.

777
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:09,220
Hey, what's up, teach?
how's the Dianetics going?

778
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:11,493
It's Dialectics.
Can I talk to you?

779
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:13,495
What's up?

780
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:17,238
Okay, look, I hate to be this
guy right now, right?

781
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:21,242
Mm-hmm.

782
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:23,505
Excuse me?

783
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:25,507
You heard me, okay,
so just do me this solid.

784
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:27,247
All right, man, please?

785
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:28,510
Do you a solid?

786
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:31,513
You know what I'm saying.
You understand me.

787
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:34,254
She's too precious kind of shit?

788
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:35,255
I'm not kidding.

789
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:36,256
Oh, I know.

790
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:39,260
So you understand?

791
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:41,523
Look, man, Drey is my family.
She's my friend, man.

792
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:44,526
All these cats,
these are my friends.

793
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:46,528
and would you like
to be my friend, man?

794
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:48,268
What the fuck is this,
fucking romper room?

795
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:51,272
What the fuck is a romper room?

796
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:52,534
Are you fucking
listening to me?

797
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:54,536
Why are you
so fucking angry, man?

798
01:11:57,346 --> 01:11:58,540
Tell me
what you're talking about.

799
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,545
Are you capable of that?

800
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:07,550
So now we back to the point of
what is white is right, right?

801
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:09,551
So-

802
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:11,291
Fuck, this has nothing to do
with that and you know it.

803
01:12:11,394 --> 01:12:12,554
- no, no, it's good for Drey
to have somebody

804
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:17,321
Like you looking out for her
Mr. Model A1 fucking citizen.

805
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:27,366
I don't know, I don't know.

806
01:12:33,416 --> 01:12:36,579
Fuck.

807
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:40,583
Because I'm supposed
to do something, right?

808
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:51,356
But what am I supposed to do?

809
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:59,603
Look, man, you want a drink?

810
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,377
What?

811
01:13:02,445 --> 01:13:03,605
Motherfucker,
do you want a drink?

812
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:09,613
I mean, are you thirsty?
How that sound?

813
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:12,614
Okay.

814
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:19,622
You want some candy?

815
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:22,624
Man, don't touch that cat.

816
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:25,366
Hey, y'all this
is teach Dan, man.

817
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:26,628
These are my boys.

818
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:28,630
That's Mike's little sister
Drey, that's her teach.

819
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:31,633
What's happening?

820
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:34,375
You ain't bringing
that shit in my house, man.

821
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:40,382
Put that cat down.
Get your ass out here.

822
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:32,696
Dunn, what's going on?

823
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:43,468
I am not now nor have
I ever been a communist.

824
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:53,454
What's happening?

825
01:14:53,522 --> 01:15:03,488
Just in the neighborhood,
thought maybe i'd surprise you.

826
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:11,462
Yeah, it's a surprise.
That's true.

827
01:15:11,574 --> 01:15:13,735
You okay?

828
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:15,475
Yeah, I'm good.

829
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:16,738
How about you?
How are you?

830
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:23,746
I'm good, a little tired,
but I'm good.

831
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:27,488
Oh, is it late?

832
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:32,755
Well, you know, what time is it?
2:30, yeah.

833
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:34,494
Oh.

834
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:35,495
Yeah.

835
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:36,758
Well, you know,
we got class tomorrow.

836
01:15:37,566 --> 01:15:44,495
Oh, I forgot about class.
I'm sorry about last time.

837
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:49,772
Okay.
It's okay.

838
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:57,781
Dunn, not right now, okay?
No.

839
01:15:58,587 --> 01:16:00,782
Dunn-
Okay, you're drunk.

840
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:11,556
What are you doing?
Stop it.

841
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:43,564
Well, that was weird.

842
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:48,569
What the fuck was that?

843
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:54,576
I don't know.

844
01:16:54,643 --> 01:16:57,578
Listen, feel free
To whatever, you know?

845
01:16:57,646 --> 01:16:58,840
Whatever.
No hard feelings.

846
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:08,852
I completely understand, okay?

847
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:13,594
Maybe i'll see you tomorrow?

848
01:17:13,696 --> 01:17:14,856
Or not, I don't know.

849
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:24,868
I'm so fucked up right now.

850
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:31,874
I hope you know
I really liked you.

851
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:37,618
I had fun.

852
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:40,883
Not tonight I didn't have fun,
but other nights I had-

853
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:51,656
We had fun, right?

854
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:56,899
Look, I'm bleeding a bit so I'm
using your couch arm thing.

855
01:17:57,706 --> 01:18:07,672
I'm gonna wash it, okay?

856
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:18,683
Sorry.

857
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:35,997
What.

858
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:38,739
How's things.

859
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:45,007
Well, how's it look?

860
01:19:45,814 --> 01:19:48,749
What do you want?

861
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:54,756
Nothing.

862
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:57,758
Look, you know,
you don't really see other kids

863
01:19:57,826 --> 01:20:03,025
Coming up to my car, Drey,
to talk to me.

864
01:20:03,832 --> 01:20:08,030
It's, you know,
I'm your teacher.

865
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:12,034
I'm not your friend.

866
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:15,036
Why don't you go play
with other kids your own age?

867
01:20:15,844 --> 01:20:19,780
I'm just trying to be alone.

868
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:26,777
Then be alone then, asshole.

869
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:33,090
Bitch.

870
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:21,104
Hey, I think Henderson
was looking for you.

871
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:25,869
Must be about
the new curriculum, huh?

872
01:21:25,948 --> 01:21:32,854
Yeah, no, I'm sure that's it,
but, hey, Dan,

873
01:21:32,955 --> 01:21:34,855
If there's anything else
going on, you know,

874
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:42,125
If you need any help,
you know, anything,

875
01:21:42,931 --> 01:21:52,897
You know
we're here for you, pal.

876
01:21:56,945 --> 01:22:06,946
Close the door.

877
01:22:10,959 --> 01:22:20,960
Is there something going on
that I should know about?

878
01:22:24,973 --> 01:22:28,932
On September 11, 1973,
The CIA helped overthrow

879
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:32,913
and murder democratically
- Elected Chilean president Salvador Allende.

880
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:34,175
The military coup led
To mass disappearances,

881
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:37,178
assassinations and tortures
Of thousands

882
01:22:37,986 --> 01:22:39,920
Of Chilean civilians
under the leadership

883
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:42,923
Of U.S. backed dictator
Augusto Pinochet.

884
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:45,186
Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger

885
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:49,191
Said of Allende's 1970
Election, "these issues are much

886
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:59,930
Too important for the Chilean
voters to decide for themselves. "

887
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:00,940
Danny?

888
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:04,205
What happened to your lip?

889
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:05,207
That's plenty, thanks.

890
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:08,948
That's good.

891
01:23:11,019 --> 01:23:12,213
You're writing a novel?

892
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:14,215
It's a kids book
that I haven't started yet.

893
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:16,957
I love children's books.
What's it about?

894
01:23:17,025 --> 01:23:18,219
Dialectics.

895
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:22,224
Dialectics.
What is that?

896
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:29,231
It's a theory that attempts
to explain how change works.

897
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:33,974
How does change work, Dan?

898
01:23:34,042 --> 01:23:35,976
Let's save it for dessert, Dad.

899
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:38,239
Yeah, it was really great.

900
01:23:39,047 --> 01:23:40,241
There were like
400,000 people there.

901
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:43,017
Oh, that's fantastic.

902
01:23:43,085 --> 01:23:44,245
What did they report it
in the press, 200,000?

903
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:46,987
Danny Glover was there.

904
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:47,987
Danny Glover,
oh, I like him.

905
01:23:48,056 --> 01:23:49,990
Mm-hmm.

906
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:51,991
What was that-

907
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:54,255
Hey, what was his name?

908
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:56,257
Charles.

909
01:23:57,065 --> 01:23:58,032
Charles, get your fat ass
off my bike,

910
01:23:58,133 --> 01:23:59,998
That's what she said,
before I fuck your fat ass up.

911
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:02,002
You said that?

912
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:04,265
You know she did,
then my man started stressing.

913
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,268
He start apologizing.
"I'm sorry.

914
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:08,269
I didn't know it was yours.
I'm sorry. "

915
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:12,012
Tell her.

916
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,012
Didn't have to.

917
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:15,276
Ah, didn't have to.

918
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:18,279
That's my girl right there,
poking people on the street.

919
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:26,026
Oh, Danny, you won't believe
what I found this week.

920
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:29,029
You guys really live it up
around here.

921
01:24:29,097 --> 01:24:33,295
You hear that, the rock star
approved, Cindy Lou Who.

922
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:35,296
Come on, Jeff,
didn't you tell her

923
01:24:36,104 --> 01:24:39,301
Around here we always party
like it's 1999.

924
01:24:40,108 --> 01:24:42,303
Oh, my god, can you be
any more embarrassing.

925
01:24:44,112 --> 01:24:47,047
No.
Check out this scar?

926
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:49,049
Remember?

927
01:24:49,151 --> 01:24:51,312
Remember this one?

928
01:24:52,120 --> 01:25:02,086
Jesus.

929
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,355
Why you got these scary things?

930
01:25:35,163 --> 01:25:39,099
Got them off the internet,
Some dude in Texas.

931
01:25:39,201 --> 01:25:41,362
I wouldn't want these things
in my house.

932
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:46,106
Well, they in my house
and my house is your house.

933
01:25:46,174 --> 01:25:56,140
So deal with it.

934
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:03,123
You ever sell to Coach?

935
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:04,385
Why?

936
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:08,390
Just wondering.

937
01:26:09,197 --> 01:26:10,129
Look, don't you think
you and Teach's relationship

938
01:26:10,198 --> 01:26:11,130
Is a little-

939
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:15,135
Inappropriate?

940
01:26:16,204 --> 01:26:19,139
He your teacher, Drey.

941
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:21,400
He's my friend.

942
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:27,409
Look, he's a basehead, all right,
and baseheads don't have friends.

943
01:26:28,216 --> 01:26:33,153
I mean, this motherfucker
was outside my house yesterday

944
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:36,156
Telling me that we shouldn't
be associated with each other.

945
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:14,194
I'm gonna take
a freight train,

946
01:27:14,296 --> 01:27:16,457
Down at the station, Lord

947
01:27:17,265 --> 01:27:22,464
I don't care
where it goes

948
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:29,210
Gonna climb me a mountain,
the highest mountain, Lord

949
01:27:29,277 --> 01:27:31,472
Gonna jump off,
nobody gonna know

950
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:36,216
Hey, teach me something, Dan.

951
01:27:36,284 --> 01:27:42,484
Teach me some ebonics.

952
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:48,490
Is that what they got
you teaching in that zoo?

953
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:50,229
Hey, tell me something.

954
01:27:50,298 --> 01:28:00,264
How do you say asshole
In ebonics?

955
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:10,240
Hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry
I'm an asshole.

956
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:15,255
I love you.
you know that, right?

957
01:28:15,357 --> 01:28:19,521
Yeah, I know.

958
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:24,264
All right.
Good, good.

959
01:28:24,332 --> 01:28:34,298
241, apartment three.

960
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:45,342
Hello?
What's up?

961
01:28:46,354 --> 01:28:51,291
I bet you are so good
with those kids, Daniel Dunn.

962
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:54,294
Thanks, Mom.

963
01:28:54,362 --> 01:28:59,299
Sometimes I think we're the
only thing keeping them sane.

964
01:28:59,367 --> 01:29:00,299
It's a good thing,
you know, to teach.

965
01:29:00,368 --> 01:29:03,303
Your father and I thought
we were going

966
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:04,303
To change the world
when we were young, you know.

967
01:29:04,372 --> 01:29:05,566
What did we know?

968
01:29:06,374 --> 01:29:07,568
Well, you stopped a war so-

969
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:09,570
You think so?

970
01:29:10,378 --> 01:29:11,310
Yeah.

971
01:29:11,379 --> 01:29:14,576
That's nice, honey.

972
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:19,319
Than anything we did, you know?

973
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:23,585
One man alone means nothing.

974
01:29:24,392 --> 01:29:28,328
I guess not.
Do you hear from Rachel anymore?

975
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:29,590
Not really.

976
01:29:30,398 --> 01:29:32,332
I saw her at the pharmacy
the other day,

977
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:36,336
Maybe it's her Mom.

978
01:29:36,404 --> 01:29:38,338
You know, she looked great.

979
01:29:38,406 --> 01:29:43,343
You should give her a call, but,
you know, clean up a little first.

980
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:45,606
You're killing me
with the tie, okay.

981
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:51,351
Stop, I'm fine.

982
01:29:51,453 --> 01:29:53,614
You happy?

983
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:56,617
I'm so happy.

984
01:29:57,425 --> 01:30:00,360
That's so great, sweetie.
you're happy, I'm happy.

985
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:08,358
Watch the basketballs,
Okay, honey?

986
01:30:08,436 --> 01:30:18,402
Hey, Mom.

987
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:35,657
How was it?
Easy, right?

988
01:30:36,464 --> 01:30:39,399
I saw you shaking all across
the street and shit.

989
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:40,661
It sure beats the hell
out of flipping burgers.

990
01:30:41,469 --> 01:30:51,435
Thank you.

991
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:10,431
Your Mom said there's
more wine out here.

992
01:31:10,532 --> 01:31:13,695
I found it.

993
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:16,697
Do you like my brother?

994
01:31:17,505 --> 01:31:19,700
Yeah.

995
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:23,705
Why?

996
01:31:24,512 --> 01:31:31,441
He's nice.
He's funny.

997
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,715
Sometimes.

998
01:31:35,523 --> 01:31:37,457
Like what?

999
01:31:37,525 --> 01:31:44,454
Like knock, knock.

1000
01:31:44,532 --> 01:31:45,726
Who's there?

1001
01:31:46,534 --> 01:31:49,731
The interrupting cow.

1002
01:31:50,538 --> 01:31:57,740
The interrupting-
Moo.

1003
01:31:58,546 --> 01:32:08,512
Yeah?

1004
01:32:51,599 --> 01:32:56,536
Where you going?
Come inside, sweetie.

1005
01:32:56,604 --> 01:33:04,534
Ain't nobody going to bite you.

1006
01:34:43,711 --> 01:34:51,914
Everything cool?

1007
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:59,922
I guess we should
get you home then.

1008
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:55,715
I don't think
It's a good idea

1009
01:35:55,783 --> 01:35:59,719
You falling asleep in front
of the tv every night.

1010
01:35:59,787 --> 01:36:01,982
What's up, Drey?
You in a funk today?

1011
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:07,727
Want to tell me why?

1012
01:36:07,795 --> 01:36:10,730
Just thinking about Mike,
I guess.

1013
01:36:10,798 --> 01:36:12,993
I miss your brother, too.

1014
01:36:13,801 --> 01:36:19,740
We'll go see him as soon
As I get some time off.

1015
01:36:19,841 --> 01:36:22,002
I can't believe they hit me
with another double tomorrow.

1016
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:30,740
Can you believe that?
I can't get a goddamn break.

1017
01:36:30,818 --> 01:36:34,754
So what else is happening?

1018
01:36:34,822 --> 01:36:35,754
I heard something about
a civil rights thing

1019
01:36:35,857 --> 01:36:40,021
With Oprah or something.

1020
01:36:40,828 --> 01:36:50,794
Drey?

1021
01:36:54,842 --> 01:36:56,776
Hi, honey, just calling
to let you know

1022
01:36:56,844 --> 01:36:59,779
How much fun
it was for us last night,

1023
01:36:59,847 --> 01:37:02,042
and we should do it more often.

1024
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:11,918
I love you, sweetie.
call us soon, okay?

1025
01:37:33,881 --> 01:37:35,075
Hello, everyone.
I'm Mr. Light.

1026
01:37:37,885 --> 01:37:39,079
I really don't know.

1027
01:37:39,887 --> 01:37:42,822
When's he coming back?

1028
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:44,084
They're not really telling me
Too much in the office.

1029
01:37:44,892 --> 01:37:54,858
Why don't you guys tell me
What you've been learning?

1030
01:38:05,913 --> 01:38:06,845
I don't know.

1031
01:38:06,914 --> 01:38:08,848
What's good with you?

1032
01:38:08,916 --> 01:38:10,110
Chilling.
Need a ride?

1033
01:38:10,918 --> 01:38:12,112
No, I got my bike.

1034
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:13,852
Well, throw it in the back.

1035
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:15,855
I got to get home.

1036
01:38:15,923 --> 01:38:17,117
Well, I'll take you.

1037
01:38:18,926 --> 01:38:22,862
Drey?

1038
01:38:22,930 --> 01:38:32,896
Look, I'll see you around, huh?

1039
01:39:15,983 --> 01:39:17,917
What happened to your friends?

1040
01:39:17,985 --> 01:39:26,916
They're gone.

1041
01:39:26,994 --> 01:39:29,189
You missed a hell of a party.

1042
01:39:29,997 --> 01:39:39,998
Looks like it.

1043
01:39:55,022 --> 01:40:05,023
Thank you.

1044
01:40:08,035 --> 01:40:18,001
Ouch.

1045
01:40:19,046 --> 01:40:24,382
You ready to go?

1046
01:40:49,076 --> 01:40:59,042
You missed a spot.

1047
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:15,295
Knock knock.

1048
01:41:16,103 --> 01:41:17,297
Who's there?

1049
01:41:18,105 --> 01:41:20,039
The interrupting cow.

1050
01:41:20,141 --> 01:41:27,047
The interrupting cow who?

1051
01:41:27,114 --> 01:41:32,313
Moo.

1052
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:34,314
That was horrible.

1053
01:41:35,122 --> 01:41:45,088
Yeah.
