00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,145
What more do you want?

176
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:19,398
I don't know.

177
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,484
Substance?

178
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:23,902
Substance.

179
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:26,531
You know nothing

180
00:07:26,532 --> 00:07:27,865
about substance.

181
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,283
I am a flavorful flawless

182
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:30,659

183
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,557
And you're some... some

184
00:07:32,558 --> 00:07:34,413
day-old coffee with a

185
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:34,413
dinky packet of Splenda

186
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,748
trying to confuse the world

187
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:37,041
that you're actually sweet.

188
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:59,438
- I'd like to return this watch
- for that gorgeous necklace.

189
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,898
What happened?

190
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,067
[heavy breathing]

191
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,130
Never mind.

192
00:08:04,131 --> 00:08:05,152
It's okay.

193
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:07,154
- But, I'm sorry.
- I can't.

194
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,843
We don't do returns

195
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:10,490
or exchanges.

196
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,951
B-but, Ella, it-it's me.

197
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,557
I... I've practically paid

198
00:08:14,558 --> 00:08:16,121
for all of your French

199
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,121
manicures this year

200
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,248
with that tennis bracelet

201
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:18,332
I bought my mom.

202
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:19,792
I would love to help you out,

203
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:21,210
but it's just our policy.

204
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:26,465
Maybe... maybe I can...

205
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,050
No-no. I don't want you

206
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:29,593
to get in trouble.

207
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,282
Um, I'll get

208
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:32,930
the necklace anyway.

209
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,681
- My mom and dad
- will forgive me.

210
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,475
They want me to have it,

211
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:38,227
especially after Derek.

212
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,688
Oh, goodness.

213
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,648
- You three girls
- are gonna look

214
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,648
So cute together

215
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,193
in your matching necklaces.

216
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,279
Thanks so much.

217
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,488
Hmm.

218
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,449
- I'm sorry,
- but your card was declined.

219
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,658
I'm sure

220
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:53,825
I just hit the wrong button.

221
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,911
[beep]

222
00:08:55,953 --> 00:09:00,540
Um, do you have another card?

223
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,793
[sighs] Stupid watch.

224
00:09:02,794 --> 00:09:05,003
I must be over my limit, again.

225
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,609
Um, you know,

226
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,173
I'll just call my parents.

227
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,175
Thanks, bye.

228
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,854
Uh-oh. Derek?

229
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:23,981
Derek?

230
00:09:23,982 --> 00:09:25,065
Derek who?

231
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,985
Oh, you mean the guy

232
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:29,611
who didn't know

233
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:30,863
we were exclusively dating

234
00:09:30,864 --> 00:09:32,072
for three months?

235
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,324
The one who I bought

236
00:09:33,325 --> 00:09:34,533
a Christmas gift for,

237
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:37,953
- maxed out my parents'
- credit card,

238
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:39,309
And now I can't buy Christmas

239
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,622
gifts for anyone else?

240
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:41,874
Yeah, that one.

241
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,083
Ugh.

242
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,923
I got yours, though.

243
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,968
Oh, thanks, Luce.

244
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:01,601
I love it.

245
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,249
It'll go perfectly with

246
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,855
those shoes with the silver...

247
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,002
Not those ones.

248
00:10:06,003 --> 00:10:07,107
Your blue ones.

249
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:10,194
How do you do that?

250
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:16,116
'Cause I have style, right?

251
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,514
Absolutely.

252
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:18,869
Of course.

253
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,099
But I have substance too,

254
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,288
right?

255
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,145
What do you mean

256
00:10:24,146 --> 00:10:25,250
by substance?

257
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,981
Like, I'm...

258
00:10:26,982 --> 00:10:28,670
I'm smart, and fun,

259
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:29,734
and a good

260
00:10:29,735 --> 00:10:30,755
conversational companion.

261
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:34,406
Luce, you just need to date

262
00:10:34,407 --> 00:10:36,303
someone who sees the real you.

263
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:38,347
But I have substance, right?

264
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:40,349
I think you're great.

265
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:41,788
You are sweet,

266
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:43,185
and generous, and...

267
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:44,541
You don't. You think

268
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:45,854
I'm unsubstantial.

269
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,108
You and Derek

270
00:10:49,109 --> 00:10:50,192
are just different.

271
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:51,673
He's in to Nietzsche

272
00:10:51,674 --> 00:10:53,111
and Kierkegaard

273
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,446
Keerka-what?

274
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,781
Philosophy.

275
00:10:55,782 --> 00:10:57,074
We're both minors.

276
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,534
Oh.

277
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,498
Becky, he doesn't even

278
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:06,833
like Christmas.

279
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,419
You love Christmas.

280
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,545
I know.

281
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:11,005
I-I thought

282
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:12,423
we were so alike.

283
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,425
- You don't want someone
- just like you.

284
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,864
You need someone

285
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:17,261
who challenges you.

286
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,450
Like right now,

287
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:19,597
I'm challenging you

288
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,265
to go get pizza with me.

289
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,682
Hmm?

290
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,560
I can't.

291
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:26,520
- I've been trying to get a hold
- of my parents all day

292
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:28,230
- To figure out
- what's going on with the card,

293
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,481
And they're not answering.

294
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,566
I've gotta go home.

295
00:11:30,608 --> 00:11:32,651
Hmm. Come here.

296
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,777
Thank you.

297
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,404
Always.

298
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,662
That's a good girl. Hmm.

299
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,665
Huh, you good?

300
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,125
You were good.

301
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,168
Hi! Look who I have.

302
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,357
-Yes.

303
00:11:51,358 --> 00:11:52,504
-She was good.

304
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,506
- -Oh, it's pay day.
- -Oh, no.

305
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:55,549
-This is for you.

306
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,550
-No, no, no, no.

307
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:57,718
Just, you know,

308
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:58,843
give it to the people

309
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:58,843
down at the canned food drive.

310
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,804
I insist.

311
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:01,888
All right, well, moowah,

312
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:02,931
you were a good girl.

313
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,016
I will you see later,

314
00:12:04,017 --> 00:12:05,058
all right?

315
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,285

Kevin, where's mom and dad?

00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,818
- They said they called you
- this morning.

324
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,258
I know. I was shopping,

325
00:12:58,259 --> 00:12:59,655
and I couldn't answer.

326
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:01,573
- Can you stop playing
- for a minute?

327
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,034
Where'd they go?

328
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,036
- The charity thing
- for the kids and stuff.

329
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,329
Remember?

330

Oh, the one in Botswana?

331
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:10,770
Oh, that's why their phones

00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:11,875
aren't working.

333
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,877
- But I didn't know
- it was at Christmas.

334
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,587
- How could they leave us
- for Christmas?

335
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,839

stuck here without them?

340
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,536

00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,657
- Closing?
- What do you mean?

516
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:00,763
Like "closing

517
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:01,826
for the holidays" closing?

518
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,245
No, I mean,

519
00:20:03,246 --> 00:20:04,621
th... they just put up a sign.

520
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,581
Th... that's a contractor's sign.

521
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,207
- They're gonna
- tear this place down.

522
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,251
You have got to be kidding.

523
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,297
- No, it's...
- It's ridiculous.

524
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,341
- This is the only place
- the dogs have to run,

525
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,968
And it's fenced in

526
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,553
and they can get their exercise.

527
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:21,826
I'm gonna have to call

528
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:23,056
city hall in the morning.

529
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,831
So, haven't seen you

530
00:20:27,832 --> 00:20:29,312
around here before.

531
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,897
I'm a dog walker, kind of.

532
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,440
I mean for the moment.

533
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:33,691
Not-not really.

534
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,048
Watch out for this one,

535
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:37,070
everybody.

536
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,822
Don't get too close.

537
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,573
- Excuse me?
- What did I do to you?

538
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:42,075
- Well, clearly,
- you're not a dog walker.

539
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:43,243
So I'm pretty sure

540
00:20:43,244 --> 00:20:44,368
this is some sort of scam.

541
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,662
Right.

542
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,038
- Right.
- So you admit it.

543
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,372
That's what you do.

544
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,541
You get handsome,

545
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:50,667
unassuming men.

546
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,085
- You trap 'em up
- in your dog leash,

547
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:53,503
- And then you go through
- their pockets

548
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:54,796
And you steal their wallets.

549
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,548
You done?

550
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,717
And what's worse

551
00:20:58,718 --> 00:20:59,843
is that you have brought

552
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,740
this poor, innocent beast

553
00:21:01,741 --> 00:21:03,596
into your criminal empire.

554
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:07,558
That is just... that is wrong.

555
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,602
- I do not have enough
- caffeine to deal with this.

556
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:11,146
- Come on, Hank,
- I need a latte.

557
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:12,480
Hank!

558
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:13,753
Run, run, my friend.

559
00:21:13,754 --> 00:21:14,983
Be free!

560
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,026
Freedom!

561
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:20,030
Hank, Hank, Hank!

562
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,406
You like her?

563
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,431
I think she just needs

564
00:21:25,432 --> 00:21:26,786
a little more dog in her life.

565
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:29,247
All right, let's see

566
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:31,666
who we call about that sign.

567
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,626
Start with the city.

568
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:36,671
- [Luce]
- Hank!

569
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,636
Mr. Paxton.

570
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,514
Mr. Paxton.

571
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,496
Oh, I see we have

572
00:21:49,497 --> 00:21:50,685
a new dog walker.

573
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,563
I'm Luce Lockhart.

574
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,690
- Steve and Shirley's daughter
- from down the street.

575
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:59,027
- You used to think
- my little brother, Kevin

576
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:00,486
- Was homeless
- from the way he dresses.

577
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,446
Oh, yes, Kevin.

578
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,698
Well, I see

579
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:04,908
you're into that too.

580
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,785
Kids these days.

581
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:11,998
Honey.

582
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,217
Oh.

583
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:27,138
- Just do a selection
- of different hot and cold.

584
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,681
Small bites.

585
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,621
Darling.

586
00:22:30,622 --> 00:22:32,518
I have to go back to work.

587
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:37,398
Hank, go eat your dinner.

588
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,566
Oh, and you know what, Deb?

589
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,318
- We should get about
- ten trays of ramahi.

590
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,112
That'd be great.

591
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,822
Ah, what happened to you?

592
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,241
Hank happened.

593
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:47,597
Oh. You kids have fun?

594
00:22:47,598 --> 00:22:48,910
He loves getting walked.

595
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:49,953
Yeah.

596
00:22:49,954 --> 00:22:50,954
More like he walked me.

597
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,122
I'm off.

598
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:53,289
Oh wait, no, um,

599
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,415
how did the closing go?

600
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:55,708
- We start construction
- next week.

601
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,751
Superb.

602
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,128
No, you're superb.

603
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,212
Oh.

604
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:01,631
[kissing]

605
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,574
Byron's building

606
00:23:07,575 --> 00:23:08,763
a new day spa.

607
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,848
Gonna be nice and fancy.

608
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,268
- They're gonna have these, um,
- hot rocks they put on your back

609
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,145
- While people
- play the pan flute.

610
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:16,646
- Really? Hopefully
- somewhere near here.

611
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,522
- I am so tired of driving
- all the way downtown

612
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,628
And making appointments

613
00:23:19,629 --> 00:23:20,691
at ten different places.

614
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,735
- No, it's gonna be
- at that small, run-down park

615
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:24,028
Right by the market.

616
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,384
Oh, really?

617
00:23:25,385 --> 00:23:26,697
I took Hank there today.

618
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:27,803
Oh, so you know

619
00:23:27,804 --> 00:23:28,866
it's a great spot. Right?

620
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,618
Oh, yeah, I guess.

621
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,765
So, what's gonna happen

622
00:23:31,766 --> 00:23:32,870
to the dog park?

623
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,184
Oh, that silly park

624
00:23:34,185 --> 00:23:35,456
makes no money at all.

625
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:37,541
If dogs only paid rent, huh?

626
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,751
- Yeah, but they're
- gonna rebuild it

627
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,211
Somewhere else, right?

628
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:41,400
Oh, no.

629
00:23:41,401 --> 00:23:42,546
We definitely won't.

630
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:43,777
Byron's only interested

631
00:23:43,778 --> 00:23:44,966
in investment opportunities.

632
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:46,843
- He says the public agenda's
- for the politicians

633
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,178
And the protesters.

634
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,222
Oh, excuse me, Hanky.

635
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,605
Yeah, hi, um, I'd like to

636
00:23:58,606 --> 00:24:00,273
speak with Mr. Byron Paxton.

637
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,277
Okay, well, what time

638
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:05,611
will he be back in tomorrow?

639
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,531
Uh, this is Dean Stanton.

640
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,845
It's regarding

641
00:24:09,846 --> 00:24:11,117
the new spa development.

642
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:15,496
Okay, yes, then I'd

643
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:16,580
like to leave a message.

644
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:37,560
[sigh] Worst Christmas ever.

645
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,853
Come on.

646
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,276
- Well, it looks like things
- are moving pretty fast.

647
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:46,736
I called the city.

648
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:47,925
I even called the

649
00:24:47,926 --> 00:24:49,072
Humane Society.

650
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:49,072
They're bummed.

651
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,219
But they say

652
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,324
why care about this park

653
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:52,616
- when they have
- plenty of others.

654
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,202
We need to start strategizing

655
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:55,516
how to take

656
00:24:55,517 --> 00:24:56,787
these developers down.

657
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:57,997
Maybe we can come up

658
00:24:57,998 --> 00:24:59,165
with a peaceful solution.

659
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:01,042
- It-it is the holidays,
- remember?

660
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:03,044
- This ain't Woodstock,
- hippie chick.

661
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:04,962
- No, but it is
- the season of hope.

662
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,360
The season of I'm gonna

663
00:25:06,361 --> 00:25:07,715
wring somebody's throat.

664
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:08,883
Bea, do you need to walk

665
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:10,009
a few laps?

666
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:12,011
- Maybe grab
- a ginseng sake shake?

667
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:14,138
Don't ginseng sake shake me.

668
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,140
- Hey guys, look,
- I got an idea.

669
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,642
- What if we start
- a city-wide petition, you know,

670
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,603
And-and that way we can show

671
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,521
- Paxton Properties
- what's-his-face,

672
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,441
- Like, how disappointed
- everyone would be

673
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:25,900
If they bulldozed the park.

674
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:27,318
It'll never work.

675
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,528
Oh, I know

676
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:29,695
I smelled optimism.

677
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:31,030
And why won't it work?

678
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,531
Because the public agenda

679
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:33,762
is only for protestors

680
00:25:33,763 --> 00:25:34,951
and politicians.

681
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,494
Um, who invited the nay-sayin'

682
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:37,995
stocking stuffer?

683
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,518
It's not me.

684
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:40,998
It's a quote from my boss,

685
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,998
Byron Paxton,

686
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,417
as in Paxton Properties

687
00:25:42,418 --> 00:25:43,793
what's-his-face.

688
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:44,856
Stockin' stuffer

689
00:25:44,857 --> 00:25:45,878
is a spy. Break!

690
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:50,800
- -Wait.
- -I'm not a spy.

691
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,051
I'm just a neighbor

692
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:53,261
of the Paxton's

693
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:55,888
and their holiday dog walker.

694
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,682
You work for Byron Paxton?

695
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,561
You're our Christmas miracle.

696
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,813
No, what?

697
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,273
- You're gonna help
- convince your boss

698
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:06,649
Not to bulldoze the park.

699
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,359
- Why would I do
- anything for you?

700
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:09,757
Well, don't you care about your

701
00:26:09,758 --> 00:26:11,112
canine friend, Hank's, future?

702
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:12,738
- Aside from
- the stench of his saliva,

703
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,198
I barely know him at all.

704
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,304
And I'm not a dog person,

705
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:16,367
remember?

706
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:17,702
Yeah, but he...

707
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:18,995
He loves you.

708
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,288
Look at him. Look.

709
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:21,539
You love her, don't you?

710
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,873
Yes, you do.

711
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:23,916
Look, I know you like

712
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:24,917
hanging out at this park,

713
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,752
but it's just a park.

714
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,212
Go find another park.

715
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,922
- Yeah, but none of them
- are like this one.

716
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:31,549
- Well, you know,
- when you teach these dogs

717
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,904
To give massages and mani/pedis,

718
00:26:32,905 --> 00:26:34,218
then we'll talk.

719
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,678
Take a walk with me.

720
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,138
No, why?

721
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,931
- Because I wanna teach you
- how to handle his leash.

722
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:40,766
- That way, he's not
- dog walking you.

723
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:41,830
Does that mean

724
00:26:41,831 --> 00:26:42,852
I have to dog walk her?

725
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,937
Who? Sweet Pea?

726
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:46,981
She likes you, right?

727
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:49,025
[dog growls]

728
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,236
- Yeah, so you gotta
- hold the leash like this.

729
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:54,280
- Give him enough slack so that
- way he can lower his head

730
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:55,614
And check his messages.

731
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:57,033
Check his messages?

732
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,117
Yeah, it's doggie code.

733
00:26:58,118 --> 00:26:59,160
When they mark their spot,

734
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:00,391
they're leaving messages

735
00:27:00,392 --> 00:27:01,579
for their friends...

736
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,039
- Kind of like when
- you and your friends

737
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,999
- Text each other
- all the latest gossip.

738
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,209
And have you always

739
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,377
wanted to be a dog walker?

740
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:09,295
- You mean why'd I get
- in the barkin' biz?

741
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:10,588
I don't know.

742
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,215
- We just... we had
- a lot of pets growing up.

743
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,217
- I mean, my folks right now
- still have like two dogs,

744
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:15,947
Three cats, and an indoor

745
00:27:15,948 --> 00:27:17,636
rabbit named Daffodil.

746
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,138
Wow, E-I-E-I-O.

747
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,890
I know, right?

748
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:23,017
- So I just started walking dogs
- when I was a kid,

749
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,435
- And I just fell in love
- with dogs.

750
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,354
- And, they just
- make life better.

751
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:27,938
- But right now,
- I'm just walking Sweet Pea

752
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,440
For an old friend of mine.

753
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:30,900
Old friend, like girlfriend,

754
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:32,318
or old friend like...?

755
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,445
Old friend in like she's 70.

756
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:37,386
Listen, I-I'm sorry about

757
00:27:37,387 --> 00:27:38,408
your doggy day camp,

758
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:39,805
but I really

759
00:27:39,806 --> 00:27:41,160
can't help you, honestly.

760
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:42,286
Yes, you can.

761
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,329
Trust me,

762
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,330
you don't want my help.

763
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:45,664
I'm bad luck.

764
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:47,708
I respectfully disagree.

765
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,918
No, really.

766
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,545
- I mean, I had a dream
- that this Christmas

767
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:52,089
Wouldn't be a total bust,

768
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,590
and look, here I am,

769
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:53,590
total bust.

770
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,989
You think your Christmas

771
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,304
is a total bust? Yours?

772
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:01,972
Hmm-hmm.

773
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,122
What about my friend,

774
00:28:05,123 --> 00:28:06,436
Lenore, over here, huh?

775
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,145
- She's been comin' to
- this dog park every day

776
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,564
For almost a year now.

777
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:10,898
She keeps fostering dogs

778
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,691
- ever since she got her divorce
- from her husband.

779
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,318
He was a real jerk.

780
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,549
Well, there's two sides

781
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,737
to every story.

782
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:18,364
- He left her for a woman
- at his work.

783
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:19,490
Ouch.

784
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:20,824
- Who was also ten years
- older than her.

785
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,535
- There should be jail time
- for that.

786
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:23,933
Yep. Secretly,

787
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:25,288
I think Lenore thinks

788
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,248
- that Mr. Right's gonna walk
- through that gate over there

789
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,583
And sweep her off her feet.

790
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:29,708
- She should try
- online dating.

791
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,210
- Yeah, right.
- Have you ever tried that?

792
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:32,628
Me? No, I lack substance

793
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:34,004
and only date pretty jerks.

794
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,840
Well, I think Lenore

795
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:37,634
just has bad luck in men,

796
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:38,947
because even online,

797
00:28:38,948 --> 00:28:40,219
it's not like it says,

798
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:41,700
"Hey, I like brunettes,

799
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:43,139
and I dig bowling,

800
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,599
"but I'm gonna cheat on you

801
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,684
- "and I have a really serious
- drinking problem,"

802
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,645
In their "about me" section.

803
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:50,250
And what does a guy in

804
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:51,814
a park with a dog have

805
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:51,814
that a dating website doesn't?

806
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,107
- [Dean]
- Well, people who have dogs

807
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:54,755
Usually have some

808
00:28:54,756 --> 00:28:56,360
substance, right?

809
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,571
- Gonna be really tough
- for Lenore to find Mr. Right

810
00:28:58,613 --> 00:29:00,864
Without this dog park here.

811
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,493
Oh, that's what this is.

812
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,662
- You're trying to guilt-trip
- the developer's dog walker.

813
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:06,996
Hmm, what?

814
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,205
Is it working?

815
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,248
Nope.

816
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:12,731
Okay, then-then, what about

817
00:29:12,732 --> 00:29:14,170
my friend, Bea, over there?

818
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,213
- Okay,
- Bea used to weigh 280 pounds.

819
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,340
[Luce] Wow.

820
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:18,716
- But then she started
- coming to the park

821
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,842
With her pup, Moonpie,

822
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,719
- and she'd circle
- like 100 times,

823
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,304
Twice a day, noon and night,

824
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:24,847
and she lost the weight.

825
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,307
Yeah, but I mean,

826
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:28,058
- the park isn't much of
- a necessity for her anymore.

827
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,310
I mean, she looks great.

828
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:30,374
No, no, no.

829
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:31,395
The woman can still eat.

830
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:32,689
- She could explode
- at any moment.

831
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,794
Yeah, but she can find

832
00:29:33,795 --> 00:29:34,857
somewhere else to walk.

833
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,066
No. No other place

834
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:37,234
allows dogs.

835
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,153
Moonpie's her motivation.

836
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,030
- Still workin'
- on the guilt trip?

837
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,573
- -Tryin'.
- -Mm-hmm.

838
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,408
- Look, I get what
- you're trying to do here,

839
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,951
And it's sweet,

840
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,245
but I can make sentimental

841
00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:48,496
arguments too, you know.

842
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:49,747
You know, like, uh...

843
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,750
Like this spa,

844
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:54,377
this temple of mani/pedis

845
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:55,649
is gonna bring jobs

846
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,879
to this town...

847
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,922
Much needed jobs.

848
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,466
- It's gonna bring people
- together,

849
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:02,801
To be happy, healthy.

850
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,220
It's gonna pretty up this town

851
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:05,846
and bring pride

852
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:07,431
to this fenced in sandbox.

853
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,371
We can do this together.

854
00:30:09,372 --> 00:30:11,268
We can get massages.

855
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,187
Yes, we can!

856
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,194
All right, you did it.

857
00:30:19,195 --> 00:30:20,737
You convinced me.

858
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:21,778
Good.

859
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:28,369
Oh. What about you, buddy?

860
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:29,746
What're you gonna do when

861
00:30:29,747 --> 00:30:31,080
this park closes down, huh?

862
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,374
Stay home, I suppose.

863
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:34,751
Yeah.

864
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:36,043
Do you know

865
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:37,294
that this park has been here

866
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,296
- before the Austin Arbor
- was built up?

867
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:40,777
The mayor at the time knew

868
00:30:40,778 --> 00:30:42,216
how valuable this park was,

869
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:43,926
- and he wouldn't let them
- build on it.

870
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,512
I mean, how many...

871
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:48,347
- How many years have you been
- coming to this...

872
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:49,495
To this park, Cliff,

873
00:30:49,496 --> 00:30:50,600
sitting on this very

874
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:50,600
bench, huh?

875
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:51,746
I don't know,

876
00:30:51,747 --> 00:30:52,851
about 40 years.

877
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,853
Yeah.

878
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,522
Forty years ago, Cliff

879
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:58,148
had just gotten back

880
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:58,148
from Vietnam,

881
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,088
and he met his wife right

882
00:31:00,089 --> 00:31:01,985
here in this very spot.

883
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,070
She was out here

884
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:04,113
walking her dog, uh...

885
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,364
-Samantha.

886
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:06,574
-Yes, Samantha, that's right.

887
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:08,075
- Cliff went right up to her
- and he said...

888
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:10,327
Good morning, beautiful.

889
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,497
And she said something like,

890
00:31:12,498 --> 00:31:14,624
"Oh, my gosh, excuse me?

891
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:15,708
"I-I just woke up

892
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:16,751
and I-I have the flu,

893
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:18,252
- "and I don't have
- any makeup on

894
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:19,712
"and I can't believe

895
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:21,130
you're hitting on me."

896
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:22,799
And he said...

897
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,467
- I was talkin'
- to your dog.

898
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,010
[laughing]

899
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,511
It's a classic.

900
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:27,511
It's so good.

901
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:28,887
And then they went back there

902
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:30,180
- and they carved
- their love initials

903
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,890
Right there on that post.

904
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:33,309
That was her, not me.

905
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:36,228
Okay. I get it.

906
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,522
- This park has sentimental value
- to Cliff and his wife.

907
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:40,128
But, I mean, you guys

908
00:31:40,129 --> 00:31:41,692
can find new places to go.

909
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,653
- I mean, you could get
- a couple's massage at the spa.

910
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:50,951
Oh, Cliff, I'm sorry.

911
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:52,911
- I-I'm sure Penny
- was a wonderful woman.

912
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:56,123
Will you excuse us?

913
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,027
That was mean.

914
00:32:04,028 --> 00:32:05,299
You tricked me.

915
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:06,550
You made everything seem so...

916
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:07,844
- -What? Insignificant?
- -No.

917
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:09,386
- -Stupid?
- -No.

918
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,930
I wanted you to come here

919
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:12,431
and see the truth. Okay?

920
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:13,662
I wanted you to see

921
00:32:13,663 --> 00:32:14,851
how this park...

922
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:16,414
How it actually

923
00:32:16,415 --> 00:32:17,936
affects real people.

924
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,564
You want the truth?

925
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,629
The truth is, money is the only

926
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,652
force driving Byron Paxton.

927
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:26,195
- I mean, do I like that?
- No.

928
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:27,905
- But unless you,
- or one of these dogs,

929
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,281
- Have a cool mil
- in the bank,

930
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:30,741
You're barking up

931
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:32,159
the wrong tree.

932
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:33,536
Come on, Hank.

933
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:46,800
Hey, hey, hey,

934
00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:47,884
look what I have.

935
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:48,968
Oh, there's my little

936
00:32:48,969 --> 00:32:50,010
Sweet Pea.

937
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:51,345
[laughs]

938
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:53,222
- Has she been
- a good girl today?

939
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,640
Always.

940
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:56,705
Oh, Dean, be a sweetheart,

941
00:32:56,706 --> 00:32:58,728
will you, and help me, uh,

942
00:32:58,769 --> 00:32:59,916
with some of those cans

943
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:01,063
in the pantry.

944
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,231
Yeah.

945
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:03,816
- I can't reach as high
- with my bad hip.

946
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:04,942
Of course, no problem.

947
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,402
- Are these for
- the canned food drive?

948
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:07,737
Yep.

949
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,739
- Oh, but take some home
- with you if you'd like.

950
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,114
Oh, no. I'm good.

951
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,867
- But I can take them down there
- for you if you want.

952
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:14,911
Oh, thank you.

953
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:16,245
What're we gonna do without you

954
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:17,538
after you graduate?

955
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,665
Hey, I'll always

956
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:19,749
be here to help,

957
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,709
- even if I can't save
- poor Sweet Pea's park

958
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:22,898
From being torn down

959
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:24,044
next week.

960
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,005
It's still nice that you made

961
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:27,924
all those calls to the city.

962
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:30,008
- I'm sure everyone at the park
- appreciates it.

963
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,844
I know Sweet Pea sure does.

964
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:33,136
It's just frustrating

965
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,242
because there's this new

966
00:33:34,243 --> 00:33:35,305
dog walker down there,

967
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,224
- and apparently,
- she works for the guy

968
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:38,809
That's bulldozing the park.

969
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,644
- We tried to talk to her
- to get her to help us,

970
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:41,729
But she refused.

971
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:42,939
I don't know,

972
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,106
I just... feel like

973
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,816
- she could have made
- a difference, you know?

974
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:47,944
Well if she's walking dogs,

975
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:49,737
she must have

976
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:51,488
some appreciation

977
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:51,488
for the park.

978
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,969
Maybe you just haven't

979
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,408
given her a good

980
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,408
enough reason yet.

981
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,410
I gave her three great ones,

982
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:57,933
but apparently, she wants

983
00:33:57,934 --> 00:33:59,413
a spa instead, so...

984
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:01,520
Is this new dog walker

985
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:03,584
pretty?

986
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:04,669
Yeah, but what's that

987
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,711
got to do with anything?

988
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:06,921
I mean, hot or not, her looks

989
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:08,088
are still over-shadowed

990
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,757
by her self-indulgence.

991
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:10,821
So she's pretty,

992
00:34:10,822 --> 00:34:11,842
but she's heartless.

993
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:13,886
Yes. Well, no.

994
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:15,701
I mean, I don't know

995
00:34:15,702 --> 00:34:17,473
if she's heartless.

996
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:18,662
You say she keeps

997
00:34:18,663 --> 00:34:19,809
coming back to the park,

998
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:20,872
so maybe she's looking

999
00:34:20,873 --> 00:34:21,894
for something there,

1000
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:24,146
but doesn't know it yet.

1001
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,772
Or maybe her boss

1002
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:27,357
sent her down there as a spy

1003
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,818
to protect his investment.

1004
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,193
- There could be cameras
- everywhere.

1005
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,528
Be careful what you say.

1006
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,530
Shh.

1007
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,491
- Or maybe,
- she just needs someone

1008
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:36,638
To help her find

1009
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,743
what she's looking for.

1010
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:39,120
I mean, it is the holidays,

1011
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:40,454
remember?

1012
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,102
Never hurts

1013
00:34:42,103 --> 00:34:43,707
to help someone in need.

1014
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:45,063
See all these canned goods?

1015
00:34:45,064 --> 00:34:46,376
Helping those in need.

1016
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,358
Good deed done.

Boom.

1018
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:51,757
Thank you, dear.

1019
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:53,175
See ya tomorrow.

1020
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,134
- [Dean]
- Bye-bye now.

1021
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,266
Here. Shake.

1022
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:05,562
Yeah, I like you too, buddy.

1023
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,817
Okay, come on. Good boy.

1024
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:12,028
Come on.

1025
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,162
Something smells like dog.

1026
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,499
Hmm.

1027
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,417
- Smells like
- flaky brother to me.

1028
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,672
No. I totally forgot.

1029
00:35:31,714 --> 00:35:32,798
I covered for you.

1030
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,550
Thanks.

1031
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:35,676
No problem.

1032
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:37,427
I needed the cash anyway.

1033
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,783
Hey, do you wanna put lights up

1034
00:35:38,784 --> 00:35:40,097
on the house tonight?

1035
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,058
- I can't.
- I got a gig tonight.

1036
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:43,684
You wanna come?

1037
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:46,062
- No. I-I mean, I think I'm just
- gonna sit and enjoy the tree.

1038
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,438
Fine. See ya, dork.

1039
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,523

You're early.

Yeah, I hope that's okay.

1049

I needed a little Hank

in my life today.

Don't we all.

- -Oh, is that...

1053
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:11,229
- Is that the new plans
- for the day spa? Can I see?

1054
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,439
Well, um...

1055
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,608
- I'm not so sure
- that's such a great idea...

1056
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,005
Problem is,

1057
00:37:16,006 --> 00:37:17,360
we're trying to

1058
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,360
figure out a way

1059
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,549
to keep our reception area

1060
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,696
from becoming a boiling pot

1061
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,094
with the morning sun

1062
00:37:21,095 --> 00:37:22,449
coming through this glass.

1063
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:23,847
So why don't you put in

1064
00:37:23,848 --> 00:37:25,202
a glass atrium...

1065
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,787
Yeah, with two separate doors,

1066
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:28,371
- one for entry
- and then into reception.

1067
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,082
That way, you trap the heat

1068
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,750
and you reflect the sun.

1069
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,168
I mean, you've got like

1070
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:34,544
ten meters of extra space here.

1071
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:35,692
You could put in

1072
00:37:35,693 --> 00:37:36,797
some bamboo trees.

1073
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:38,278
They're beautiful

1074
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:39,716
and they love the sun.

1075
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,698
That's a great idea.

1076
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:43,637
Don't you think so, honey?

1077
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,410
Actually,

1078
00:37:45,411 --> 00:37:47,141
we may be able to see

1079
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:49,143

- could work, yeah.

Sure. I'll go get Hank.

- Okay.
- I didn't think she...

1084
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,817
Oh, also, that wasted space

1085
00:37:56,818 --> 00:37:58,944
in the southern corner,

1086
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:00,195
you should use a salt water

1087

aquarium there.

1088
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,740
It will relax your guests.

- I mean, the last time
- I was here,

1102
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,323
- There were so many people
- here with their dogs.

1103
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,034
Most people are out of town,

00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:49,327
- or doing holiday stuff
- with their families, I guess.

1105
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,620
You done with your shopping?

1106
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:51,663
Yeah, I did all of it

1107
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:52,664
last week after finals.

1108
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:54,332
- Actually maxed out
- my parents' credit card.

1109
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:55,709
Ouch.

1110
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:57,127
- What's your family doing
- for Christmas?

1111
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:58,837
Well, my parents are in Africa

1112
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:00,505
at this charity thing,

1113
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,674
- so it's just my brother and I
- until they get back.

1114
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:03,717
Probably be picking up

1115
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:04,718
the cranberry

1116
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,720

- for the two of us.

Aw, well, it's nice

1118
00:39:08,098 --> 00:39:09,431
your brother's around.

1119
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,641
- Yeah, I mean, I don't get
- to see him very much though.

1120
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,560
- He's been rehearsing
- for this huge gig he has

1121
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:15,104
On Christmas Eve.

1126
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:24,613
[laughs] Hardly.

1127
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,676
I am not desperate

1128
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:26,698
for love or anything,

1129
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,221

but if fostering these pups

1132
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:32,809
leads me to finally

1133
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:33,956
finding a decent guy,

1134
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,332
then I suppose

1135
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:36,666
it'll be a double win.

1136
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,376
- Yeah, I just got out

So I feel ya.

- if you'd like.

1141
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:47,594

- on anything,

00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,919
Ugh. Whatever.

1182
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,129
- You act like
- you don't like it,

1183
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:06,006
- But you keep coming back
- for more.

1184
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,030
I come back for Hank,

1185
00:41:09,031 --> 00:41:10,427
not because of you.

1186
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,553
It's the only place

1187
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:12,637
I can take this yak.

1188
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,390
Oh, you see that, Hank?

1189
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:15,620
She does have a soft

1190
00:41:15,621 --> 00:41:16,808
spot in her heart

1191
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:16,808
for you after all,

1192
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,790
underneath all that

1193
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:20,729
cashmere and all her

1194
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:20,729
bling, and her...

1195
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,147
Doesn't change my excitement

1196
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:23,857
- for this park being
- bulldozed by a big rig.

1197
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,442
Ha, who's laughing now?

1198
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,485
Morning, Cliff.

1199
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:28,820
Oh, Cliff, I'm so sorry.

1200
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:30,113
I...

1201
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,512
I know.

1202
00:41:32,513 --> 00:41:33,783
You heard her, boy.

1203
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,118
- But I'm sure
- she's got a heart

1204
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,724
Under all that perfume

1205
00:41:36,725 --> 00:41:38,288
somewhere.

1206
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,916
- So what do you get
- out of this?

1207
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:42,251
Making fun of you?

1208
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:44,086
- Makes me feel better
- about my own short-comings.

1209
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,795
- No, I mean, what do you get
- out of this park?

1210
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,797
- I mean, all your friends here
- have a reason

1211
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,258
- That they want this park
- to keep going on.

1212
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:50,759
What's yours?

1213
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,885
None ya.

1214
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:53,012
-None ya?

1215
00:41:53,013 --> 00:41:54,096
-None ya business.

1216
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:56,431
Good boy.

1217
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,061
[dog barking]

1218
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:10,904
Are you following me?

1219
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:12,322
Please.

1220
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:13,698
Don't flatter yourself.

1221
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:16,326
You are following me.

1222
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:18,370
What? No, I'm not.

1223
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:19,829
- I was just gonna go get
- some ice cream.

1224
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,040
- Good ice cream's over there.
- I'm getting coffee.

1225
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:23,541
- Yeah, that's what I want...
- Coffee.

1226
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,127
- -That's not what you said.
- -I meant coffee.

1227
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:27,879
[chuckle]

1228
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:34,886
Oh, we can't take

1229
00:42:34,887 --> 00:42:36,054
dogs in anyway.

1230
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:37,118
Oh, here. Hold Sweet Pea.

1231
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,140
I'll go get 'em.

1232
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,808
- No, you don't even know
- what I like.

1233
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:41,122
And she looks like

1234
00:42:41,123 --> 00:42:42,394
she's gonna kill me.

1235
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,528
Hank, if she moves,

1236
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,447
eat her.

1237
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:54,948
[door opens]

1238
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,659
- [Dean]
- I know. Yeah.

1239
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,701
Luce?

1240
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:02,164
Hey.

1241
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:03,415
What are you doing here?

1242
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:05,417
- [Luce]
- Oh, hi.

1243
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:06,752
Wow, that shirt

1244
00:43:06,753 --> 00:43:08,044
looks great on you.

1245
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:11,631
Thank you.

1246
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:13,258
I just ran into Derek.

1247
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:16,469
Super.

1248
00:43:21,183 --> 00:43:23,101
Where'd you get those dogs?

1249
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:25,103
- Oh, uh,
- they're a friend of mine's.

1250
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:27,063
- I'm just waiting
- until he gets back.

1251
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,169
-He?

1252
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,232
-They're so cute.

1253
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:31,151
Yeah, I guess.

1254
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:33,903
[growling]

1255
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,280
I just heard that they're

1256
00:43:35,281 --> 00:43:36,614
opening up a new day spa

1257
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,116
over at that old park,

1258
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:39,368
and I know how much

1259
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:40,577
you've been wanting one.

1260
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,475
Actually, it's a dog park

1261
00:43:42,476 --> 00:43:44,331
and it's been there forever.

1262
00:43:44,373 --> 00:43:46,333
Oh, I didn't know that.

1263
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:48,585
Oh, I got us two coffees.

1264
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,919
I tried to get you a coffee

1265
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,547
- that was 90 percent sugar
- and 10 percent coffee,

1266
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:53,173
- But all they had were
- these peppermint mochas,

1267
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,632
- Which is like 99 and one,
- but who cares.

1268
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:55,884
This is to my hard-working

1269
00:43:55,885 --> 00:43:57,093
dog walking fella.

1270
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:59,012
- I drank a lot of this
- before I even came out here.

1271
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:00,389
Hello. Cheers.

1272
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,349
Hi.

1273
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:03,517
Dog walker?

1274
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:05,643
You got a job?

1275
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:06,811
A job, uh, no.

1276
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,105
This is Dean,

1277
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:09,356
uh, he's my colleague.

1278
00:44:09,398 --> 00:44:10,462
We're working

1279
00:44:10,463 --> 00:44:11,525
to save the park.

1280
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:12,589
Nice to meet you.

1281
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:13,610
What?

1282
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,195
Uh, yeah, this is Becky,

1283
00:44:15,196 --> 00:44:16,738
my roommate and friend,

1284
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:17,822
and Derek.

1285
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:18,865
We used to date, kind of.

1286
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:19,866
Oh. Oh.

1287
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:22,785
Oh. Oh-oh.

1288
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,391
Yes, Luce and I are working

1289
00:44:24,392 --> 00:44:25,955
hard to save the park.

1290
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,353
I mean, we are trying to show

1291
00:44:27,354 --> 00:44:28,708
the historical significance

1292
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,586
and the social necessity

1293
00:44:30,587 --> 00:44:32,421
of the park.

1294
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:34,256
You know, at first, we thought

1295
00:44:34,257 --> 00:44:36,049
Luce here had no substance.

1296
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:37,842
I mean, none.

1297
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,073
Under all those...

1298
00:44:39,074 --> 00:44:40,262
Those designer clothes

1299
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:41,638
and those... those handbags

1300
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:42,972
she's always carrying,

1301
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:44,954
but then all of a sudden,

1302
00:44:44,955 --> 00:44:46,893
out of nowhere, boom!

1303
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:48,478
She surprises us and starts

1304
00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:50,021
spearheading the campaign

1305
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:51,648
to help save the park.

1306
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,066
I mean, working tirelessly,

1307
00:44:53,067 --> 00:44:54,443
day and night.

1308
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:57,571
We... we are so lucky

1309
00:44:57,572 --> 00:45:00,657
to have her onboard with us.

1310
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,200
She is our holiday miracle.

1311
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:03,701
She really is.

1312
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:06,288
- She reall... in fact, do you know
- what she just said yesterday?

1313
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,874
She said, and I quote,

1314
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:11,418
"I promise you, Dean,

1315
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,629
"that I am going to call

1316
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,797
Byron Paxton himself,

1317
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,778
and convince him to stop

1318
00:45:17,779 --> 00:45:19,717
building the day spa."

1319
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:21,928
Did you not?

1320
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,308
Yep. [chuckle]

1321
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,184
- Holiday miracle
- right here.

1322
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:31,688
Wow. That's great.

1323
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,481
Yeah, Luce.

1324
00:45:33,482 --> 00:45:35,233
That is so exciting.

1325
00:45:35,275 --> 00:45:37,152
Good for you.

1326
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:45,911
Well, I guess

1327
00:45:45,912 --> 00:45:47,996
we have a park to save.

1328
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,872
- Yeah,
- we'll see you two later.

1329
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,207
Okay.

1330
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:52,250
See ya.

1331
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:56,379
All right.

1332
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:58,340
- You should have said,
- "See you latte." Oh!

1333
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,070
Shut up and walk.

1334
00:46:00,071 --> 00:46:01,759
Thanks for that... and this.

1335
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,470
It's perfect.

1336
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,015
- So have you
- made up your mind?

1337
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:08,725
Well, now I have to.

1338
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,060
I mean, you talked it all up

1339
00:46:10,061 --> 00:46:11,353
and went all crazy.

1340
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:12,729
- But this is gonna take
- a lot more

1341
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,606
- Than just a sit-down
- with my boss.

1342
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:16,525
- I mean, Byron Paxton
- barely even knows I exist.

1343
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:17,964
But his wife is sweet

1344
00:46:17,965 --> 00:46:19,361
and she likes me,

1345
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:20,820
and she loves Hank.

1509
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:30,606
I think you're right.

1510
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:39,824
[Dean]

1511
00:52:39,825 --> 00:52:40,992
He's a really good dog.

1512
00:52:41,034 --> 00:52:43,244
Oh, and there she is!

1513
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,787
Our Christmas hostess

1514
00:52:44,788 --> 00:52:46,288
with the mostest... Luce!

1515
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,832
I'm telling all my friends.

1516
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:49,333
They will just love it.

1517
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,752
- Thanks.
- I had a lot of help.

1518
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:52,670
- Oh, no, no.
- She is being modest.

1519
00:52:52,712 --> 00:52:53,713
We wouldn't be able to do

1520
00:52:53,714 --> 00:52:54,714
any of this without her.

1521
00:52:54,756 --> 00:52:56,049
- All right, let's go.
- Should we go?

1522
00:52:56,091 --> 00:52:57,299
- -Yeah.
- -Can I have my dog back?

1523
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,136
- All right, say,
- "Bye, Sweet Pea."

1524
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,471
Bye, Sweet Pea.

1525
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:03,598
Bye-bye.

1526
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:05,016
Come on.

1527
00:53:05,017 --> 00:53:06,392
Come on.

1528
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:08,144
- [Luce]
- Come on.

1529
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:16,861
- Wow, this place
- really looks beautiful.

1530
00:53:16,903 --> 00:53:18,217
Ah, it's gonna be great,

1531
00:53:18,218 --> 00:53:19,530
thanks to you.

1532
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:24,410
- So what made you
- change your mind?

1533
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:25,828
What do you mean?

1534
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:27,580
- Well, up until yesterday,
- you were pretty hell bent

1535
00:53:27,622 --> 00:53:29,415
- About getting
- a spa built here.

1536
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:31,251
But now it's like

1537
00:53:31,252 --> 00:53:33,044
you've become one of us

1538
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:33,044
dog-obsessed weirdos.

1539
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,319
I guess seeing

1540
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,758
Derek and Becky,

1541
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,302
it just made me wanna

1542
00:53:40,303 --> 00:53:41,803
prove something, you know,

1543
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:42,950
show people that I don't

1544
00:53:42,951 --> 00:53:44,055
lack substance.

1545
00:53:44,097 --> 00:53:45,223
Ah, substance.

1546
00:53:45,224 --> 00:53:46,348
Right. Right, yeah.

1547
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,517
You have no idea what

1548
00:53:47,518 --> 00:53:48,643
I'm talking about, do you?

1549
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:50,394
- I just don't get
- why you're so obsessed

1550
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:51,521
With this whole

1551
00:53:51,522 --> 00:53:52,605
substance thing.

1552
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:54,315
- I just don't want people
- to think of me

1553
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,817
As some silly girl

1554
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:57,547
who only thinks about

1555
00:53:57,548 --> 00:53:59,236
fashion and shopping.

1556
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:01,635
I mean, as great as

1557
00:54:01,636 --> 00:54:02,782
those may be.

1558
00:54:02,824 --> 00:54:04,241
Who thinks that?

1559
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:05,618
Honestly, I think I did.

1560
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,662
I mean, deep down,

1561
00:54:07,663 --> 00:54:09,664
I always saw myself that way.

1562
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:11,373
- But, I don't wanna
- feel that way anymore.

1563
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:12,917
I want to do something

1564
00:54:12,918 --> 00:54:14,418
that matters, you know?

1565
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,420
And this seems to matter.

1566
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:18,026
I mean, to park regulars,

1567
00:54:18,027 --> 00:54:19,590
to dogs, and you.

1568
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:27,264
- -Nope.
- -Yes.

1569
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:28,683
-No.

1570
00:54:28,684 --> 00:54:30,059
-Spill it.

1571
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:31,519
Nope. Not happening.

1572
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,146
Hmm-hmm.

1573
00:54:33,188 --> 00:54:34,606
I told you this was

1574
00:54:34,607 --> 00:54:36,024
none of your business.

1575
00:54:36,065 --> 00:54:37,671
But you are so impressed

1576
00:54:37,672 --> 00:54:39,276
with how open I was,

1577
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:40,653
- that now you're compelled
- to tell me.

1578
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,867
- So why does the park
- mean so much to you?

1579
00:54:47,243 --> 00:54:48,745
Okay.

1580
00:54:48,746 --> 00:54:50,246
I wanna be a vet, okay?

1581
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,413
- That-that's my...
- That's my dream.

1582
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:53,374
That is what I want.

1583
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,416
And I-I work hard,

1584
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:55,417
and I study hard,

1585
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:57,170
- and there is nothing
- I wouldn't do

1586
00:54:57,212 --> 00:54:58,880
To see my dream come true.

1587
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:02,967
But, thing is, I'm dyslexic.

1588
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:04,510
It's not that big of a deal.

1589
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:06,888
- It just makes it really,
- really hard to read sometimes.

1590
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:08,327
And-and when I do,

1591
00:55:08,328 --> 00:55:09,724
when I get frustrated,

1592
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:11,309
I come here,

1593
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:12,852
and I work with the dogs,

1594
00:55:12,894 --> 00:55:15,459
and suddenly... suddenly

1595
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:18,024
it all makes sense.

1596
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:21,944
I mean, I'm at the top

1597
00:55:21,945 --> 00:55:23,612
of my class because of

1598
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:23,612
this place.

1599
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:26,011
And, well, I just feel like

1600
00:55:26,012 --> 00:55:28,367
I owe it to the park to...

1601
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:30,036
- To try to protect it,
- you know?

1602
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:34,373
Okay. Thank you.

1603
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,273
Hey, and ultimately,

1604
00:55:38,274 --> 00:55:39,587
if we can't save it

1605
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:41,005
and it ends up

1606
00:55:41,006 --> 00:55:42,381
getting torn down,

1607
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:43,466
at least we went out

1608
00:55:43,467 --> 00:55:44,508
with a bang, right?

1609
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:45,760
Or a bark.

1610
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:47,053
[dog barking]

1611
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:50,139
Bark.

1612
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:53,893
Come on, that was good.

1613
00:55:53,935 --> 00:55:55,895
- -Mm-mm.
- -It was.

1614
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:57,563
- -Nope.
- -Oh.

1615
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:08,574
What? No lights?

1616
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:10,618
- [Luce] Yeah, I've been bugging
- my brother to help me.

1617
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,328
- He's too busy
- being a 17-year-old.

1618
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:21,420
Okay, I'll admit,

1619
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:22,943
that grilled cheese

1620
00:56:22,944 --> 00:56:24,423
was really good.

1621
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:25,821
Hey, don't thank me.

1622
00:56:25,822 --> 00:56:27,176
It's my mom's recipe.

1623
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:28,219
Are you going home

1624
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,220
for the holidays?

1625
00:56:29,262 --> 00:56:31,680
No, it's too expensive.

1626
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:32,911
You mean,

1627
00:56:32,912 --> 00:56:34,100
your parents won't pay?

1628
00:56:34,142 --> 00:56:35,727
I-I'm sorry.

1629
00:56:35,728 --> 00:56:37,312
I shouldn't have asked that.

1630
00:56:37,353 --> 00:56:38,688
No, no, it's okay.

1631
00:56:38,689 --> 00:56:40,022
I mean, they would pay.

1632
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:41,837
It's just... my dad,

1633
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:43,609
he got laid off this past year,

1634
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:45,320
- and my mom,
- she's a dental assistant,

1635
00:56:45,361 --> 00:56:46,696
So she doesn't make

1636
00:56:46,697 --> 00:56:48,030
that much money.

1637
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:49,386
Things are just kind of

1638
00:56:49,387 --> 00:56:50,699
tough for them right now.

1639
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,285
That's too bad.

1640
00:56:52,327 --> 00:56:53,390
Yeah, I know.

1641
00:56:53,391 --> 00:56:54,453
My mom's really bummed.

1642
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:57,498
She wants me to come home.

1643
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,208
- I mean,
- I'm sure your parents

1644
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:01,294
- Would rather spend the money
- and see you over the holidays.

1645
00:57:01,336 --> 00:57:02,462
I mean, maybe

1646
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,587
you should have let them.

1647
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:06,507
You think?

1648
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,259
Yeah, I mean,

1649
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,969
my parents took off.

1650
00:57:10,011 --> 00:57:12,054
- I know they're doing really
- great things for the world,

1651
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:16,725
But when I have a family,

1652
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,164
I want them to be with me

1653
00:57:18,165 --> 00:57:19,561
every year at Christmas.

1654
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,397
- I mean, that's what
- the holidays are about, right?

1655
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,317
It's not Christmas presents

1656
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:27,195
and shopping specials,

1657
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:29,364
and spas, and...

1658
00:57:29,405 --> 00:57:31,532
Okay.

1659
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:33,534
- What's your favorite
- Christmas movie?

1660
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,597
Hands down, Home Alone.

1661
00:57:34,598 --> 00:57:35,619
One and Two.

1662
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:40,333
Home Alone movie marathon?

1663
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:42,251
- -Oh, yeah.
- -Hmm?

1664
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:43,294
[laughter]

1665
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:51,552
- -Hey, oh.
- -What is this?

1666
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,616
Hey, easy there, unless

1667
00:57:53,617 --> 00:57:55,639
you wanna be a Sweet Pea sundae.

1668
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:58,809
Grr.

1669
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:01,312
Wow.

1670
00:58:01,354 --> 00:58:03,898
They're just sketches.

1671
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:05,462
Yeah, but they're...

1672
00:58:05,463 --> 00:58:06,984

hate me so much anyway?

01:11:49,891 --> 01:11:52,142
for this giant heap of dirt

2004
01:11:52,184 --> 01:11:54,644
that happens to belong to me.

2005
01:11:54,686 --> 01:11:56,771
So I thank you kindly to leave.

2006
01:11:58,857 --> 01:12:00,358
Merry Christmas.

2007
01:12:02,069 --> 01:12:03,403
- Get 'em out of here
- and lock it up.

2008
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:05,947
- Bring it, boys!
- Mama's got enough for everybody.

2009
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:08,992
Okay, easy there, soldier.

2010
01:12:09,034 --> 01:12:10,994
- Mr. Paxton.
- Hi, I'm Dean Stanton.

2011
01:12:11,036 --> 01:12:12,454
I, uh, I work with the dogs

2012
01:12:12,455 --> 01:12:13,872
here at the park.

2013
01:12:13,914 --> 01:12:15,082
I'm just about to graduate

2014
01:12:15,083 --> 01:12:16,250
vet school

2015
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:18,168
and I've been coming here

2016
01:12:18,169 --> 01:12:20,045
forever.

2017
01:12:20,087 --> 01:12:22,110
Look, I know you have

2018
01:12:22,111 --> 01:12:24,132
a considerable

2019
01:12:20,087 --> 01:12:24,132
investment in this park.

2020
01:12:24,174 --> 01:12:25,884
- I'm sorry about
- your problems, son,

2021
01:12:25,926 --> 01:12:27,302
But I'm not city council.

2022
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:28,490
You see, the bottom line is

2023
01:12:28,491 --> 01:12:29,637
this park belongs to me,

2024
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,390
and I've been allowing you

2025
01:12:31,391 --> 01:12:33,100
to use it free of charge.

2026
01:12:33,141 --> 01:12:35,331
So take my advice, leave,

2027
01:12:35,332 --> 01:12:37,520
before I get nasty.

2028
01:12:39,273 --> 01:12:40,607
Now.

2029
01:12:53,078 --> 01:12:56,831
Wow, you look beautiful.

2030
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:59,626
I mean, hello, person

2031
01:12:59,627 --> 01:13:02,378
who I've never met before,

2032
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,590
who is also really pretty.

2033
01:13:05,632 --> 01:13:07,259
Thank you.

2034
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:08,885
They are friendly.

2035
01:13:16,684 --> 01:13:18,103
Hi.

2036
01:13:18,145 --> 01:13:19,354
Wow, this looks so great.

2037
01:13:19,355 --> 01:13:20,563
I mean, with all the lights.

2038
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:22,482
Uh, yeah, yo-your brother,

2039
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:24,151
- he came down and helped us
- set 'em all up.

2040
01:13:24,192 --> 01:13:25,360
- -Really?
- -Yeah.

2041
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:26,820
- Why-why don't you go
- talk to him?

2042
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:28,196
I gotta go talk to Mr. Paxton.

2043
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:29,239
-Okay.

2044
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:30,240
-I'll be right back.

2045
01:13:34,328 --> 01:13:36,621
Luce! Luce, Luce, Luce.

2046
01:13:36,663 --> 01:13:38,623
What are you doing here?

2047
01:13:38,665 --> 01:13:40,334
- -Okay, who...
- -Was that?

2048
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:42,002
Oh, that was Dean.

2049
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:43,753
- -He's...
- -He's adorable.

2050
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:44,879
Hot.

2051
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:46,277
And super smart,

2052
01:13:46,278 --> 01:13:47,632
and kind, and giving.

2053
01:13:47,674 --> 01:13:50,364
-Oh, he sounds perfect.

2054
01:13:50,365 --> 01:13:53,054
-Oh, he's not.

2055
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:54,202
But, I mean, he's got

2056
01:13:54,203 --> 01:13:55,307
a really great heart,

2057
01:13:55,349 --> 01:13:56,830
and substance, so maybe

2058
01:13:56,831 --> 01:13:58,310
he's perfect for me.

2059
01:13:58,352 --> 01:13:59,561
-Oh.

2060
01:13:59,562 --> 01:14:00,770
-Oh, my gosh.

2061
01:14:00,812 --> 01:14:02,439
-Look at the Christmas tree.

2062
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:04,065
-Oh, it's so pretty.

2063
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:05,275
Can we go take a look?

2064
01:14:11,156 --> 01:14:14,826
Hello, I don't know you.

2065
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:16,223
Dork, everyone already knows

2066
01:14:16,224 --> 01:14:17,578
you're my brother.

2067
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,622
- And what are you doing here?
- I thought you had a huge gig.

2068
01:14:19,664 --> 01:14:22,167
My sister needed me.

2069
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,441
Oh, thanks for coming

2070
01:14:25,442 --> 01:14:27,088
and setting up all the lights.

2071
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:28,298
-It looks beautiful.

2072
01:14:28,299 --> 01:14:29,465
-No problem.

2073
01:14:31,718 --> 01:14:32,719
-Uh-oh.

2074
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:33,720
-What?

2075
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:44,314
What are you doing here?

2076
01:14:44,356 --> 01:14:45,773
We came to support your cause.

2077
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:49,069
This is... this is beautiful.

2078
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:51,154
You can't be here.

2079
01:14:55,075 --> 01:14:56,493
You're mad.

2080
01:14:56,494 --> 01:14:57,911
I understand.

2081
01:14:57,952 --> 01:14:59,787
But I want you to know

2082
01:14:59,788 --> 01:15:01,622
that I... I like Derek.

2083
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:03,583
But I'm not gonna date him.

2084
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:05,585
Because I just

2085
01:15:05,586 --> 01:15:07,545
wouldn't do that to you.

2086
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:09,797
Okay?

2087
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:11,633
No, no. I mean, you were

2088
01:15:11,634 --> 01:15:13,427
right about everything.

2089
01:15:13,468 --> 01:15:14,990
I found someone who sees me,

2090
01:15:14,991 --> 01:15:16,512
someone who challenges me,

2091
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:18,306
makes me like myself.

2092
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:21,747
Wow.

2093
01:15:21,748 --> 01:15:23,519
That-that's great.

2094
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:24,687
And I want that for you too.

2095
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:26,502
And, I mean, if Derek

2096
01:15:26,503 --> 01:15:28,275
does that for you,

2097
01:15:28,316 --> 01:15:29,693
makes you happy

2098
01:15:29,694 --> 01:15:31,069
with all his Derekness,

2099
01:15:31,111 --> 01:15:33,363
then you should go for it.

2100
01:15:37,325 --> 01:15:38,868
Thank you.

2101
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:40,703
- That-that's
- the best present ever.

2102
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:41,871
Thank you so much.

2103
01:15:41,913 --> 01:15:43,039
Okay, now you need

2104
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,165
to get out of here

2105
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:46,418
- because my boss is raging,
- and I don't want you to see it.

2106
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:47,586
Okay.

2107
01:15:47,587 --> 01:15:48,711
I totally understand.

2108
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:50,630
[mouths] Thank you.

2109
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:54,863
-Where are my trucks?

2110
01:15:54,864 --> 01:15:56,719
-Sir, you have a dog.

2111
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:58,472
You have to understand.

2112
01:15:58,513 --> 01:16:00,474
- Yeah, I have a goldfish,
- too, kid,

2113
01:16:00,515 --> 01:16:01,620
But that doesn't mean

2114
01:16:01,621 --> 01:16:02,725
I bought him a pond.

2115
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:04,603
Luce.

2116
01:16:04,604 --> 01:16:06,438
This is amazing.

2117
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,356
- I'm so impressed
- you set all this up.

2118
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:11,776
Oh, no.

2119
01:16:14,529 --> 01:16:15,655
You did this?

2120
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:18,950
Um...

2121
01:16:18,992 --> 01:16:20,827
- I have to say,
- I'm a bit shocked.

2122
01:16:20,868 --> 01:16:22,745
- -Luce?
- -I'm so sorry, Missy.

2123
01:16:22,787 --> 01:16:25,165
I just thought...

2124
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:26,583
After all I've done

2125
01:16:26,584 --> 01:16:27,959
for you, Lucinda.

2126
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:29,961
- There's no inda.
- It's just Luce.

2127
01:16:30,003 --> 01:16:32,068
What? Wait a minute.

2128
01:16:32,069 --> 01:16:34,132
Who are you?

2129
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:36,780
-She walks Hank.

2130
01:16:36,781 --> 01:16:37,802
-Huh?

2131
01:16:37,844 --> 01:16:39,366
Oh, you.

2132
01:16:39,367 --> 01:16:40,888
You traitor.

2133
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:43,266
-You dog walking traitor.

2134
01:16:43,267 --> 01:16:45,601
-Dog walker?

2135
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:47,521
- I thought you were on
- the committee to save the park.

2136
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:50,148
Uh, both?

2137
01:16:52,526 --> 01:16:54,777
Fa-la-la-la-la-la...

2138
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:57,697
[horn blowing in distance]

2139
01:16:57,738 --> 01:16:58,781
Finally.

2140
01:16:58,782 --> 01:16:59,824
This place comes down now.

2141
01:17:12,587 --> 01:17:13,609
Are... are you sure

2142
01:17:13,610 --> 01:17:14,630
that that's okay?

2143
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:15,819
Sure. He'll be fine.

2144
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:16,966
He loves it.

2145
01:17:17,008 --> 01:17:18,698
Might as well let him have

2146
01:17:18,699 --> 01:17:20,387
one last run around the park.

2147
01:17:20,428 --> 01:17:22,096
-Oh. Look at him go.

2148
01:17:22,097 --> 01:17:23,764
-Yeah.

2149
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:26,059
See, it's small.

2150
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:27,643
- There's not a lot of grass
- and it's fenced in.

2151
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:28,936
And it might not be as great

2152
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,897
- as some of the more
- modern parks in the city,

2153
01:17:30,938 --> 01:17:32,044
But, for a dog,

2154
01:17:32,045 --> 01:17:33,149
this place is perfect.

2155
01:17:33,191 --> 01:17:34,650
I can see that.

2156
01:17:36,694 --> 01:17:37,820
I just really thought

2157
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:39,280
- we could convince
- Mr. Paxton, you know?

2158
01:17:39,322 --> 01:17:40,636
I mean, if he saw how people

2159
01:17:40,637 --> 01:17:41,949
cared about this place...

2160
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:44,077
Byron barks loudly,

2161
01:17:44,078 --> 01:17:46,162
but he isn't mean.

2162
01:17:46,204 --> 01:17:47,831
[Byron] Everyone get out,

2163
01:17:47,832 --> 01:17:49,457
or I'm gonna throw you out.

2164
01:17:49,499 --> 01:17:50,834
It's just, he only

2165
01:17:50,835 --> 01:17:52,168
understands business.

2166
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:54,379
I mean, that's all he knows.

2167
01:17:54,421 --> 01:17:56,798
So when you come in talking

2168
01:17:56,799 --> 01:17:59,175
about passion and... and people,

2169
01:17:59,217 --> 01:18:02,136
he just doesn't understand.

2170
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:03,638
It's just such a shame.

2171
01:18:03,639 --> 01:18:05,098
I mean, there's so much

2172
01:18:05,139 --> 01:18:06,849
- that can be done
- with this space.

2173
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:08,268
Like what?

2174
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:09,727
- Well, what time
- do you normally walk Hank

2175
01:18:09,769 --> 01:18:10,978
When I'm not around?

2176
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,272
Oh, goodness.

2177
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:13,856
- That stinker gets me up
- at the crack of dawn.

2178
01:18:13,898 --> 01:18:15,191
And believe me,

2179
01:18:15,192 --> 01:18:16,484
I am not a morning person.

2180
01:18:16,526 --> 01:18:17,860
- You know,
- this would be a perfect spot

2181
01:18:17,902 --> 01:18:19,529
For a high-end coffee stand.

2182
01:18:19,571 --> 01:18:21,322
- Instead of being dragged
- around in the morning,

2183
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:23,450
- You could let your puppy play
- and get your caffeine fix.

2184
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:25,306
Mmm.

2185
01:18:25,307 --> 01:18:27,120
Peppermint mochas, right?

2186
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:28,496
And, you know, over there,

2187
01:18:28,538 --> 01:18:30,144
it would be a perfect spot

2188
01:18:30,145 --> 01:18:31,749
for the high-end café.

2189
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:33,209
- You wouldn't only get
- the morning crowd,

2190
01:18:33,251 --> 01:18:35,128
- But you could also get
- the people coming home

2191
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:37,192
After work walking their dogs

2192
01:18:37,193 --> 01:18:39,215
who are too tired to cook.

2193
01:18:39,257 --> 01:18:40,425
Constant revenue.

2194
01:18:40,467 --> 01:18:41,781
Do you know why this park

2195
01:18:41,782 --> 01:18:43,094
looks so old?

2196
01:18:43,136 --> 01:18:44,367
-Why?

2197
01:18:44,368 --> 01:18:45,597
-It's because it is old.

2198
01:18:45,639 --> 01:18:47,265
And I bet with some paperwork,

2199
01:18:47,307 --> 01:18:48,704
and a few choice testimonials

2200
01:18:48,705 --> 01:18:50,101
from some honored war veterans

2201
01:18:50,143 --> 01:18:51,207
who have been coming here

2202
01:18:51,208 --> 01:18:52,270
for 40 years,

2203
01:18:52,312 --> 01:18:53,605
- it probably
- wouldn't take a lot

2204
01:18:53,647 --> 01:18:55,231
- To make this
- a historic landmark.

2205
01:18:55,273 --> 01:18:56,670
Which would mean

2206
01:18:56,671 --> 01:18:58,067
no property taxes.

2207
01:18:58,109 --> 01:19:00,028
Hmm.

2208
01:19:00,029 --> 01:19:01,946
A large dog owning market,

2209
01:19:01,988 --> 01:19:03,615
with the revenue of

2210
01:19:03,616 --> 01:19:05,241
high-demand coffee,

2211
01:19:05,283 --> 01:19:06,472
and low expenses

2212
01:19:06,473 --> 01:19:07,661
of the city-protected park...

2213
01:19:07,702 --> 01:19:09,245
- And a trendy spa
- may not last,

2214
01:19:09,287 --> 01:19:11,122
- But people are always
- gonna love their dogs.

2215
01:19:11,164 --> 01:19:12,915
- And then you wouldn't
- have to sink all that money

2216
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:15,418
Into the construction.

2217
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:16,877
- I bet you'd actually make
- more of a profit

2218
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:18,004
Over a ten-year period

2219
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:19,797
- if you made this
- an official dog park.

2220
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:21,424
7.5 years, I'd say.

2221
01:19:23,009 --> 01:19:24,552
- All right.
- Let's do that.

2222
01:19:24,594 --> 01:19:26,762
Wait, what?

2223
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:28,348
- [Byron] Okay.
- What we need to do

2224
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:29,766
Is we need to put a chain

2225
01:19:29,767 --> 01:19:31,142
on the entrance over there,

2226
01:19:31,184 --> 01:19:33,394
- and we also need to put a chain
- on the entrance over there,

2227
01:19:33,436 --> 01:19:34,979
- Which some people
- like to call an exit.

2228
01:19:35,021 --> 01:19:36,439
We just need approval,

2229
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:37,857
and we're all set.

2230
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:39,463
Approval denied.

2231
01:19:39,464 --> 01:19:41,027
You can stop working.

2232
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:42,111
We are going to turn this

2233
01:19:42,112 --> 01:19:43,154
into an official dog park.

2234
01:19:43,196 --> 01:19:44,489
What?

2235
01:19:44,531 --> 01:19:45,781
- Bob, would you please
- tell the boys

2236
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:47,492
- That we're awfully sorry
- we brought them out here

2237
01:19:47,534 --> 01:19:48,743
On Christmas Eve?

2238
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,119
And that they should grab

2239
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,454
a drink, a cookie,

2240
01:19:51,496 --> 01:19:52,998
enjoy the lights, and, well,

2241
01:19:52,999 --> 01:19:54,499
they'll still get paid.

2242
01:19:54,541 --> 01:19:56,334
You got it, boss.

2243
01:19:56,376 --> 01:19:57,835
- Wait.
- You're the boss?

2244
01:19:57,877 --> 01:19:59,587
I know.

2245
01:19:59,629 --> 01:20:01,068
You must think I'm some

2246
01:20:01,069 --> 01:20:02,507
kind of model trophy wife,

2247
01:20:02,549 --> 01:20:04,800
or British royalty.

2248
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:06,990
But no, I'm just the CEO of

2249
01:20:06,991 --> 01:20:09,138
a multinational construction

2250
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:11,432
and development corporation.

2251
01:20:11,474 --> 01:20:13,100
Wow.

2252
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:17,689
No, you wowed me.

2253
01:20:17,731 --> 01:20:18,857
This is a great plan.

2254
01:20:18,858 --> 01:20:19,982
Well done.

2255
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:21,359
Very well done.

2256
01:20:21,401 --> 01:20:23,737
- Honey, can we please
- think about this for a moment?

2257
01:20:23,778 --> 01:20:24,883
I mean, we put so much time

2258
01:20:24,884 --> 01:20:25,988
and energy into this,

2259
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:28,157
- are you sure that you wanna
- throw it all away

2260
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:29,909
On a bunch of dogs?

2261
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:31,118
-Shh, just a second, okay?

2262
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:32,286
-Yes, dear.

2263
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:35,394
Now, if we invest in this,

2264
01:20:35,395 --> 01:20:38,459
it'll need some renovation.

2265
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:40,253
You know dogs,

2266
01:20:40,254 --> 01:20:42,004
you know this park.

2267
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:43,277
If we pair you up with

2268
01:20:43,278 --> 01:20:44,507
a talented and savvy designer,

2269
01:20:44,549 --> 01:20:47,051
- do you think that the two of you
- could spearhead this project?

2270
01:20:47,093 --> 01:20:48,532
-Absolutely.

2271
01:20:48,533 --> 01:20:49,970
-Great.

2272
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:52,119
Well, what my Missy wants,

2273
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:54,225
my Missy gets.

2274
01:20:54,267 --> 01:20:57,458
She's the brains of the outfit,

2275
01:20:57,459 --> 01:21:00,648
and I trust her instincts.

2276
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:02,483
- Like that time
- at the investment group?

2277
01:21:02,525 --> 01:21:04,026
- Oh, the time that
- they tried to bypass?

2278
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:05,152
Right, and they thought,

2279
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:07,154
- "With those tax codes,
- there's no way."

2280
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:08,239
That's right.

2281
01:21:08,281 --> 01:21:10,262
Oh, all those brains

2282
01:21:10,263 --> 01:21:12,243
and beauty too.

2283
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:14,308
-I'm a lucky guy.

2284
01:21:14,309 --> 01:21:16,330
-We make a great team.

2285
01:21:22,128 --> 01:21:23,421
-Merry Christmas, sweetie.

2286
01:21:23,422 --> 01:21:24,714
-Merry Christmas.

2287
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:35,475
Wow, you did it.

2288
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:36,726
I did, I guess.

2289
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,728
- No, I mean, you did it.
- You saved the park.

2290
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:40,793
I mean, I always knew

2291
01:21:40,794 --> 01:21:42,816
you could, but you did it.

2292
01:21:42,857 --> 01:21:44,317
I did it.

2293
01:21:44,358 --> 01:21:45,652
- -It's a Christmas mirac...
- -Nope.

2294
01:21:45,693 --> 01:21:47,153
- No?
- See, that one felt right.

2295
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:48,258
-No.

2296
01:21:48,259 --> 01:21:49,322
-That...

2297
01:21:49,363 --> 01:21:51,053
Oh, oh, oh.

2298
01:21:51,054 --> 01:21:52,742
I almost forgot.

2299
01:21:52,784 --> 01:21:53,785
I put what I owe you

2300
01:21:53,786 --> 01:21:54,786
on this card.

2301
01:21:54,828 --> 01:21:55,891
Go get that necklace,

2302
01:21:55,892 --> 01:21:56,954
sweetheart.

2303
01:21:56,996 --> 01:21:58,539
Thank you so much.

2304
01:22:01,292 --> 01:22:02,731
-Here.

2305
01:22:02,732 --> 01:22:04,170
-Oh, necklace.

2306
01:22:04,211 --> 01:22:05,880
We can go get it.

2307
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:07,965
- -You think the store's open?
- -Oh, we don't have to go there.

2308
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:09,467
- -Oh, you can do it online?
- -Hmm-hmm.

2309
01:22:09,509 --> 01:22:10,760
- Oh. Wow,
- you're really good at that.

2310
01:22:10,802 --> 01:22:12,219
- What're you trying to do,
- start a fire?

2311
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:14,180
Shh.

2312
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:15,973
- I can't type that fast
- with my phone.

2313
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:18,184
- -Plus, my autocorrect hates me.
- -Got it.

2314
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:19,894
-I also have really fat thumbs.

2315
01:22:19,895 --> 01:22:21,562
-Done.

2316
01:22:21,604 --> 01:22:23,272
You can pick it up tomorrow.

2317
01:22:23,314 --> 01:22:24,816
Do you think the jewelry store

2318
01:22:24,817 --> 01:22:26,317
will be open tomorrow?

2319
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:29,320
No, but the airport is.

2320
01:22:29,362 --> 01:22:30,988
Airport?

2321
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:34,074
I bought you a ticket home.

2322
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:36,076
What?

2323
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:38,538
Go see your family.

2324
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:40,039
- I'll be here
- when you get back.

2325
01:22:43,668 --> 01:22:44,919
I don't know what to say.

2326
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,297
Yes, you do.

2327
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:53,260
This is a Christmas miracle.

2328
01:23:04,939 --> 01:23:07,650
♪ It was the perfect time

2329
01:23:07,651 --> 01:23:10,361

01:23:10,403 --> 01:23:13,302
