1
00:01:23,154 --> 00:01:27,033
...And she did it
in her lover's apartment.

2
00:01:27,658 --> 00:01:30,036
Slitting wrists sounds scary...

3
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:34,791
You think she bled a lot?

4
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:37,794
It must be hard with her Dad gone

5
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:40,713
and her Mum doing that.

6
00:01:40,797 --> 00:01:43,549
Sachiko doesn't have a Dad?
- No.

7
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:45,385
Did you know Natsuko?

8
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,222
No.

9
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:13,413
HARMFUL INSECT

10
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:41,816
I'm finished.

11
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:48,406
Are you a bit late today?

12
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:50,241
Run along.

13
00:03:04,547 --> 00:03:05,840
See you later.

14
00:03:05,923 --> 00:03:08,051
Bye honey.

15
00:03:11,637 --> 00:03:14,265
Good morning.

16
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:15,892
You're late.

17
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:57,493
Dear Ms. Sachiko Kita, how are you?

18
00:04:57,528 --> 00:05:00,534
Things have finally
settled down here.

19
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:03,786
I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't scared.

20
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:07,003
But I can't let myself run away now.

21
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:54,717
When's your period?

22
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:57,595
When's your period?

23
00:05:58,304 --> 00:06:00,598
Hey, come on...

24
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,893
When's your period?

25
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,015
Rise.

26
00:09:33,644 --> 00:09:34,854
Bow.

27
00:09:37,815 --> 00:09:39,233
Be seated.

28
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:22,276
The male of the 'Beta' fish
blows froth to make a nest,

29
00:10:22,311 --> 00:10:26,986
and after luring a female inside,
he bends his body

30
00:10:27,021 --> 00:10:31,661
and forces the eggs out of her
by squeezing her body.

31
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:06,028
A group against nuclear power plants
interviewed me today,

32
00:11:06,063 --> 00:11:11,034
asking why I quit being a teacher
to work in such a place.

33
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:16,004
I can't give them the answer
they expect,

34
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:20,960
so it was funny to think why I was
chosen for the interview.

35
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,391
What is this?

36
00:14:34,195 --> 00:14:35,530
Here.

37
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:02,557
I wonder how Sachiko's doing?

38
00:15:02,765 --> 00:15:05,768
Sachiko Kita? Who cares?

39
00:15:05,893 --> 00:15:09,856
Hey, what we were saying,
I'd choose Hanasaka.

40
00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:11,524
He's taller now.

41
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:13,985
In grade school he was so cute.

42
00:15:14,027 --> 00:15:17,196
Was he popular?
- Don't know.

43
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:43,639
Mr. Kyuzo!

44
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:55,026
Mr. Kyuzo...

45
00:18:28,137 --> 00:18:31,064
I saw a strange dream.

46
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:34,435
There were no stars or moon
in the night sky,

47
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,647
and there was garbage all around me.

48
00:20:02,482 --> 00:20:03,691
Here.

49
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:07,362
Thanks.

50
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:44,959
I'm home.

51
00:21:44,994 --> 00:21:46,210
Hi honey.

52
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:56,471
Sachiko.

53
00:21:57,555 --> 00:22:00,641
A girl named Miss Yamaoka
came by today.

54
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:07,690
So, you haven't been going to school.

55
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:15,490
I'm not angry at you
or anything like that.

56
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:21,746
You can go back to school when you
feel you're up to it again.

57
00:27:38,813 --> 00:27:40,940
Who does she think she is?

58
00:27:41,065 --> 00:27:43,901
She doesn't care about you, Natsuko.

59
00:27:45,486 --> 00:27:48,781
Let's stop doing this. It's no use.

60
00:27:49,323 --> 00:27:53,369
That rumor about Sachiko
and her sixth grade teacher?

61
00:27:53,578 --> 00:27:56,622
The teacher quit his job
and disappeared.

62
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:58,791
Isn't that weird?

63
00:28:34,744 --> 00:28:37,622
No wait, let me explain...

64
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,250
Huh?

65
00:28:42,251 --> 00:28:44,295
No, that's not true.

66
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:49,092
When you were angry before,
it wasn't my fault...

67
00:28:51,552 --> 00:28:54,013
I'm saying it's a misunderstanding.

68
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:56,474
You're acting strange lately...

69
00:29:00,186 --> 00:29:02,021
Don't push it.

70
00:29:02,438 --> 00:29:05,942
I mean,
why did you clear out my room?

71
00:29:07,402 --> 00:29:09,320
I've had it with you.

72
00:29:28,631 --> 00:29:32,343
Are you... alright?

73
00:29:57,118 --> 00:30:02,290
Hello? Yeah I'm fine, it's nothing.

74
00:30:02,874 --> 00:30:04,876
I'll tell you later.

75
00:30:05,251 --> 00:30:09,839
Oh, can I come over?

76
00:30:12,425 --> 00:30:14,093
Okay, see you.

77
00:30:30,526 --> 00:30:33,154
Wow. A piece of cake.

78
00:30:33,613 --> 00:30:36,491
Can't believe he had so much.

79
00:30:43,873 --> 00:30:45,041
No thanks.

80
00:30:45,124 --> 00:30:46,167
Yeah?

81
00:32:30,646 --> 00:32:32,273
Mr. Kyuzo!

82
00:32:34,942 --> 00:32:36,152
Arsehole!

83
00:32:36,903 --> 00:32:39,280
Go to hell, you piece of garbage.

84
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,328
Where is this?

85
00:33:27,829 --> 00:33:29,706
Takao's place?

86
00:33:37,088 --> 00:33:39,257
You again?

87
00:33:39,757 --> 00:33:42,593
That's the Yamakawa's
and they're not in.

88
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,388
Your friend's place is
on the forth floor.

89
00:33:47,348 --> 00:33:52,770
Isn't he silly? He's mistaken
his friend's room again?

90
00:33:52,805 --> 00:33:56,274
Friend? Doggy's friend?

91
00:34:53,581 --> 00:34:55,249
What happened?

92
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,382
Wait, I'll go get Mr. Kyuzo.

93
00:35:06,511 --> 00:35:07,804
Mr. Kyuzo!

94
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,112
A fight?

95
00:35:29,951 --> 00:35:31,369
Does it hurt?

96
00:35:32,578 --> 00:35:33,996
The hospital?

97
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:39,293
Go to the hospital.

98
00:35:40,336 --> 00:35:42,672
I can't go to the hospital.

99
00:35:43,715 --> 00:35:45,133
But you have to.

100
00:35:45,299 --> 00:35:46,884
I can't.

101
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,807
Why not?

102
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,364
How much do you have on you?

103
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,366
What?

104
00:36:32,513 --> 00:36:34,849
I'll get money.

105
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:38,144
How?

106
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,526
I'll borrow some from Mom.
It's okay.

107
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:36,828
Do you want something?

108
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,917
I can help you, you know.
Money, right?

109
00:37:44,419 --> 00:37:46,504
You want money, right?

110
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:50,425
How much?

111
00:37:51,843 --> 00:37:54,053
Let's discuss it inside.

112
00:38:59,035 --> 00:39:00,703
I'm home.

113
00:39:03,206 --> 00:39:04,832
Hi there.

114
00:39:06,334 --> 00:39:08,336
Oh, hi honey.

115
00:39:08,795 --> 00:39:12,799
This is Mr. Tokugawa.
He's my friend.

116
00:39:19,972 --> 00:39:21,474
Your kid?

117
00:39:21,724 --> 00:39:22,975
Yeah.

118
00:39:30,024 --> 00:39:31,818
Hello.

119
00:40:10,982 --> 00:40:13,192
Do me a favor?

120
00:40:18,114 --> 00:40:20,074
I want to try it, too.

121
00:40:21,242 --> 00:40:22,910
Try what?

122
00:40:23,786 --> 00:40:26,539
Test my nerves. Fake an accident.

123
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:29,667
What are you saying?

124
00:40:31,002 --> 00:40:33,087
If you say no I'll do it myself.

125
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:42,305
When a car comes like this,
you go like this.

126
00:40:42,347 --> 00:40:45,308
- Timing is the key,
so watch closely.
- Right.

127
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:47,935
Don't go if I signal you.

128
00:40:48,019 --> 00:40:50,605
It's dangerous because it's too fast.

129
00:41:00,156 --> 00:41:02,116
Forget it, let's go.
- Why not?

130
00:41:02,158 --> 00:41:03,993
Money's not worth it!

131
00:41:04,118 --> 00:41:05,870
It's not for the money.

132
00:41:06,037 --> 00:41:08,081
We won't do it, let's go.

133
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,541
No.

134
00:42:47,013 --> 00:42:48,097
Want one?

135
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:49,223
No.

136
00:43:14,665 --> 00:43:15,875
What?

137
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,251
Nothing.

138
00:43:39,065 --> 00:43:40,358
Hey.

139
00:43:40,692 --> 00:43:41,776
Yeah?

140
00:43:41,859 --> 00:43:44,278
Let's run away somewhere.

141
00:43:44,362 --> 00:43:45,279
Far away?

142
00:43:45,363 --> 00:43:46,531
Yeah.

143
00:43:47,281 --> 00:43:49,367
Okay. When?

144
00:43:50,993 --> 00:43:52,370
Tomorrow.

145
00:43:53,413 --> 00:43:55,415
Okay. Let's go.

146
00:43:56,499 --> 00:44:00,712
Then tomorrow, ten o'clock,
at the floating pier.

147
00:44:07,885 --> 00:44:10,096
Tomorrow at ten, okay?

148
00:44:41,627 --> 00:44:46,132
Mr. Ogata, if I went away
to a place you don't know,

149
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:51,102
would you be lonely?
Or would you not care?

150
00:44:51,137 --> 00:44:56,142
Thinking such things confuses me.
But right now, I feel fine.

151
00:46:07,422 --> 00:46:12,051
I think you mean the so called
'Battle Fish', Sachiko.

152
00:46:22,979 --> 00:46:28,380
The males apparently battle against
each other savagely.

153
00:46:28,415 --> 00:46:33,781
Those tiny fish bite each other
for an entire day and night.

154
00:47:36,594 --> 00:47:38,054
Hi, you're home.

155
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,931
You're late.

156
00:47:40,098 --> 00:47:44,185
Mr. Tokugawa brought some
expensive beef from home

157
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:47,939
and we were waiting
to have dinner with you.

158
00:47:48,147 --> 00:47:49,982
But we've already started.

159
00:47:50,191 --> 00:47:52,568
Want some?
- Yeah.

160
00:48:49,584 --> 00:48:55,089
If you write your dreams in
your diary everyday, you die.

161
00:48:55,124 --> 00:48:59,177
If this is true, it's a bit scary.

162
00:49:59,862 --> 00:50:04,367
I've decided to start going
to school again.

163
00:50:32,979 --> 00:50:37,316
The seasons change differently
from where you are.

164
00:50:37,351 --> 00:50:41,654
Well then,
take good care of yourself.

165
00:50:41,689 --> 00:50:45,616
You're always on my mind, Sachiko.

166
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:49,454
School Festival Program: CHORUS.

167
00:50:52,457 --> 00:50:54,799
Okay, first the conductor.

168
00:50:54,834 --> 00:50:58,087
Any volunteers? Recommendations?

169
00:51:00,173 --> 00:51:02,258
I'll name somebody if not.

170
00:51:03,468 --> 00:51:06,054
Okay, Hanasaka.

171
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:08,306
Huh? Me?

172
00:51:11,517 --> 00:51:13,936
Next, the piano accompaniment.

173
00:51:14,103 --> 00:51:17,523
Oh, Miss Kagemaru is absent so...

174
00:51:18,566 --> 00:51:22,695
Anyone else want to try?
Recommendations?

175
00:51:22,987 --> 00:51:24,364
Anybody?

176
00:51:24,447 --> 00:51:27,033
Yes! Miss Kita can do it.

177
00:51:28,743 --> 00:51:32,121
She plays piano really well.
I've heard her before.

178
00:51:32,538 --> 00:51:34,415
Miss Kita, how about it?

179
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:43,508
If there's no one else,
it'll be you or Miss Kagemaru.

180
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:47,220
We'll discuss this again
when she returns.

181
00:51:47,762 --> 00:51:49,639
Okay, next...

182
00:52:33,641 --> 00:52:40,648
<i>Thin fog covers the harbor where</i>

183
00:52:40,815 --> 00:52:47,739
<i>The ships come in,
white with morning frost</i>

184
00:52:48,072 --> 00:52:54,871
<i>Only the call
of waterfall is heard</i>

185
00:52:55,204 --> 00:53:02,045
<i>The house on the shore
is still silent</i>

186
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:07,300
When a=3, then y=3x.
- Right.

187
00:53:07,508 --> 00:53:08,850
So, the answer...

188
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:11,929
No, y=15 so this x...
- Go away!

189
00:53:13,473 --> 00:53:14,682
Cool.

190
00:53:14,932 --> 00:53:18,061
Hey, give it back.

191
00:53:18,478 --> 00:53:20,063
Kunpe!

192
00:53:22,315 --> 00:53:29,322
<i>Crows call out high
in the trees</i>

193
00:53:29,489 --> 00:53:36,371
<i>People are in the fields
treading wheat</i>

194
00:53:36,788 --> 00:53:43,753
<i>How peaceful is this
warm winter day</i>

195
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:51,427
<i>Flowers blooming out of season
can be seen</i>

196
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:58,226
You like Natsuko Yamaoka, right?

197
00:53:58,267 --> 00:54:00,228
No, I don't.
- You do!

198
00:54:00,263 --> 00:54:01,771
Good luck!

199
00:54:01,854 --> 00:54:03,780
Wait, I don't.

200
00:54:03,815 --> 00:54:04,899
Your face is red...

201
00:54:05,608 --> 00:54:12,073
<i>Storm blows,
the clouds fall</i>

202
00:54:12,865 --> 00:54:19,789
<i>Winter rain falls,
the day fades</i>

203
00:54:20,081 --> 00:54:26,754
<i>If not for the faint light
leaking through</i>

204
00:54:27,463 --> 00:54:34,679
<i>The village would go unnoticed</i>

205
00:54:35,179 --> 00:54:46,649
<i>The village would go unnoticed</i>

206
00:55:09,881 --> 00:55:10,965
We did great.

207
00:55:11,299 --> 00:55:13,134
Yeah. Good job.

208
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:17,680
It was fun.

209
00:55:44,999 --> 00:55:46,667
I'm exhausted.

210
00:55:47,752 --> 00:55:49,921
Where's Soko?
- Don't know.

211
00:55:50,505 --> 00:55:51,714
Oh.

212
00:55:53,424 --> 00:55:54,592
Here.

213
00:55:54,676 --> 00:55:56,302
Thanks.

214
00:55:57,970 --> 00:55:59,263
Nice place.

215
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:00,473
Yeah.

216
00:56:03,518 --> 00:56:04,644
Yamaoka?

217
00:56:10,692 --> 00:56:12,026
What?

218
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:14,028
Can we talk?

219
00:56:20,118 --> 00:56:21,244
What?

220
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:23,162
Come on.

221
00:56:41,014 --> 00:56:42,265
Been smoking?

222
00:56:56,154 --> 00:57:00,825
What... why? Since when?

223
00:57:13,588 --> 00:57:15,256
Yeah...

224
00:57:16,049 --> 00:57:17,258
Yeah.

225
00:57:17,675 --> 00:57:18,926
Right.

226
00:57:19,594 --> 00:57:22,722
He asked me if you liked anybody now,

227
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:25,975
so I told him probably not.

228
00:57:27,727 --> 00:57:29,604
You two should go out.

229
00:57:29,812 --> 00:57:31,606
I'm all for it.

230
00:57:34,525 --> 00:57:36,069
Yeah...

231
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:39,030
He's a nice guy.

232
00:57:41,115 --> 00:57:43,910
Nothing to worry about. You're cute.

233
00:57:46,579 --> 00:57:48,039
Yeah...

234
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:50,500
Yep.

235
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:52,335
Bye.

236
00:57:58,049 --> 00:58:00,343
You want some apples?

237
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,887
No. Not now.

238
01:00:27,365 --> 01:00:28,741
I'm home.

239
01:00:30,368 --> 01:00:31,744
Hi, Sachi.

240
01:00:34,914 --> 01:00:37,875
I borrowed that key under the planter.

241
01:00:38,418 --> 01:00:41,713
I think Mom will be back home soon.

242
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:40,063
Mrs. Kita.

243
01:01:41,105 --> 01:01:42,648
Sachi's in trouble!

244
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:14,764
Mrs. Kita,

245
01:02:15,848 --> 01:02:17,934
a man was attacking...

246
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,736
It's okay, Sachi.

247
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:33,074
It's okay...

248
01:02:37,829 --> 01:02:39,163
Mrs. Kita!

249
01:02:39,831 --> 01:02:41,791
Poor Sachi.

250
01:02:42,834 --> 01:02:44,627
This isn't...

251
01:02:46,921 --> 01:02:48,464
Why?

252
01:02:49,549 --> 01:02:51,175
Why?

253
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:54,345
She's finally
coming to school again.

254
01:02:56,806 --> 01:03:00,643
Her father's gone
and her mother tries to die.

255
01:03:03,396 --> 01:03:05,815
Sachi's in pain, too.

256
01:03:06,566 --> 01:03:08,985
We're only in seventh grade.

257
01:03:09,777 --> 01:03:12,905
Why does Sachi
have to suffer so much?

258
01:03:13,114 --> 01:03:16,492
I feel so sorry for her...

259
01:04:13,758 --> 01:04:19,764
Is it true that happiness deserts
anyone who tries to commit suicide?

260
01:04:19,799 --> 01:04:25,520
Does this mean that
Mom can never be happy again?

261
01:04:25,645 --> 01:04:29,322
You're still thirteen,

262
01:04:29,357 --> 01:04:33,569
so you probably should be
dating boy's your age.

263
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:36,948
I heard that a man
ran out of her house.

264
01:04:37,198 --> 01:04:38,866
Her Mom's boyfriend.

265
01:04:38,991 --> 01:04:40,702
The same one as before?

266
01:04:40,785 --> 01:04:42,537
I heard it's not.

267
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:44,997
Hey, I heard that he is.

268
01:04:48,292 --> 01:04:49,752
Didn't we agree yesterday

269
01:04:49,961 --> 01:04:51,587
to leave her alone?

270
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:55,550
Who cares? She's not here listening.

271
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:39,010
Oh, Sachi.

272
01:05:39,344 --> 01:05:42,680
We have a meeting after school,
so will you wait?

273
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:44,849
Let's go home together.

274
01:05:45,892 --> 01:05:47,560
I'll be alright.

275
01:05:49,896 --> 01:05:51,981
Go home with Kunpe, then.

276
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:55,568
Hanasaka's cleaning the clubroom.

277
01:05:56,611 --> 01:05:58,404
Want me to go get him?

278
01:05:58,863 --> 01:06:00,740
Or do you want to?

279
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:02,325
Yeah.

280
01:06:02,867 --> 01:06:03,951
Okay.

281
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:06,412
Bye, then.

282
01:06:06,746 --> 01:06:07,747
Bye.

283
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:15,171
Those rumors about her...

284
01:06:15,588 --> 01:06:17,513
I wonder how much is true?

285
01:06:17,548 --> 01:06:20,218
- I want to know too.
- Don't you?

286
01:06:21,219 --> 01:06:23,971
Natsuko, you know, don't you?

287
01:06:24,006 --> 01:06:25,515
No, I really don't.

288
01:06:25,765 --> 01:06:28,184
I think she'd tell me about it.

289
01:06:28,393 --> 01:06:32,772
Then, why'd you suggest
throwing a party for Sachiko?

290
01:06:33,314 --> 01:06:36,359
Did you think she'd
stop coming again?

291
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:56,212
Mr. Kyuzo! Where have you been?

292
01:07:01,634 --> 01:07:03,177
Don't!

293
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:08,099
Don't, you'll get sick.

294
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:37,587
Okay, by adding hydrogen peroxide
to the manganese dioxide,

295
01:07:37,754 --> 01:07:40,340
a gas is generated.

296
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:44,761
Now, to find out what this gas

297
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:48,097
that we've just collected is,

298
01:07:48,181 --> 01:07:51,351
we're going to test it's nature.

299
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:54,937
Stand back.

300
01:08:03,154 --> 01:08:05,073
Now,

301
01:08:06,532 --> 01:08:11,913
by gradually lowering this...

302
01:09:08,928 --> 01:09:10,972
What do you want?

303
01:09:13,474 --> 01:09:17,103
Have you been avoiding me?

304
01:09:22,275 --> 01:09:25,737
I don't know what's going on,
but tell me

305
01:09:25,945 --> 01:09:28,239
anything that's on your mind.

306
01:09:29,657 --> 01:09:31,784
You're my girlfriend, right?

307
01:09:33,327 --> 01:09:35,872
But, there isn't anything.

308
01:09:42,754 --> 01:09:45,757
A guy from your grade school told me

309
01:09:46,591 --> 01:09:49,510
about your sixth grade teacher,
Ogata...

310
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:19,707
Wow! It's really growing.

311
01:12:06,981 --> 01:12:12,660
When I saw the charred,
splattered toad I felt sick.

312
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:19,619
I wonder if you'll laugh and say you
can't understand me anymore?

313
01:13:02,537 --> 01:13:07,291
If all evil is the essence
of human existence,

314
01:13:07,326 --> 01:13:12,046
and if goodness
is state barely not evil...

315
01:13:28,646 --> 01:13:33,943
The thing that appears to be
furthest from the truth...

316
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:59,560
You're not much of a talker,
are you?

317
01:19:05,483 --> 01:19:07,652
Well, suit yourself.

318
01:19:16,911 --> 01:19:20,665
Behind your seat there's a
brown paper bag.

319
01:19:21,416 --> 01:19:23,251
There's some apples, take one.

320
01:19:23,918 --> 01:19:25,753
You're hungry, aren't you?

321
01:19:29,549 --> 01:19:31,134
No, thanks.

322
01:19:31,884 --> 01:19:33,886
Don't be shy.

323
01:19:35,471 --> 01:19:36,973
You're still young.

324
01:19:41,561 --> 01:19:42,687
Here.

325
01:19:43,896 --> 01:19:45,857
It's not poisoned.

326
01:19:46,524 --> 01:19:47,650
Eat it.

327
01:19:49,902 --> 01:19:51,487
It's good.

328
01:19:56,951 --> 01:19:59,954
But you know, being young is great.

329
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:11,215
I feel so old...

330
01:20:16,429 --> 01:20:17,347
A dog?

331
01:20:17,555 --> 01:20:18,806
A cat.

332
01:20:19,307 --> 01:20:21,642
It made it across so it was safe.

333
01:20:22,352 --> 01:20:25,188
When they stop from the shock,
splat.

334
01:20:27,732 --> 01:20:31,527
Have you ever had a dog or a cat?
As a pet?

335
01:20:32,945 --> 01:20:33,988
No.

336
01:20:40,286 --> 01:20:45,166
Do you know what it feels like
to be almost hit by a car?

337
01:22:21,262 --> 01:22:22,305
That?

338
01:22:22,972 --> 01:22:26,100
Yes, that's the
Akifaya Nuclear Power Plant.

339
01:22:37,779 --> 01:22:39,822
<i>Hello, Narushima Electric.</i>

340
01:22:42,075 --> 01:22:46,120
<i>Could I speak to
Mr. Satoshi Ogata?</i>

341
01:23:58,484 --> 01:23:59,986
Why?

342
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,244
I didn't say that.

343
01:24:23,092 --> 01:24:24,594
I don't get it...

344
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,231
You're not from around here,
are you?

345
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:22,694
Ran away?

346
01:25:42,463 --> 01:25:44,173
Excuse me!

347
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:52,473
Thanks.

348
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:06,738
I'm not saying running away is bad.

349
01:26:06,779 --> 01:26:08,906
I can really understand.

350
01:26:10,033 --> 01:26:12,118
I mean, I've done it as well.

351
01:26:12,952 --> 01:26:17,832
But if you're gonna get along alone,
you'll need cash, right?

352
01:26:18,207 --> 01:26:20,293
You're really cute.

353
01:26:21,169 --> 01:26:22,420
Hello?!

354
01:26:23,546 --> 01:26:29,052
So, if you want,
I can get you an easy job.

355
01:26:36,434 --> 01:26:38,311
How old are you?

356
01:26:42,106 --> 01:26:43,483
Seventeen?

357
01:26:54,994 --> 01:27:00,375
Why couldn't you forgive yourself,
Mr. Ogata?

358
01:28:06,733 --> 01:28:08,317
What?

359
01:28:11,154 --> 01:28:12,822
Nothing.
