1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:03,031
Previously on Outsiders...

2
00:00:03,032 --> 00:00:04,598
Evening, Foster.

3
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:06,800
What's the matter? You scared?
You scared to die?

4
00:00:07,315 --> 00:00:10,637
Will you be my queen, G'winveer?

5
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:12,440
I accept.

6
00:00:12,475 --> 00:00:13,974
You took everything from me.

7
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:16,377
So finish what you started
the day I was born.

8
00:00:18,512 --> 00:00:20,514
Foster!

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,749
It's not worth it. It's not worth it.

10
00:00:23,244 --> 00:00:25,018
What's it like up there?

11
00:00:25,054 --> 00:00:26,420
Well, it's beautiful.

12
00:00:26,456 --> 00:00:28,122
There's more stars than you can count.

13
00:00:28,157 --> 00:00:31,228
I'm not sleeping down here
like some homeless person.

14
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:33,828
Hasil Farrell?

15
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:34,795
Pleasure, miss.

16
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,797
I say we buy us four,
five jugs of kerosene,

17
00:00:36,832 --> 00:00:38,499
go up there and burn their asses!

18
00:00:38,534 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah! Yeah!

19
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:42,636
- Caught one of 'em.
- On the lives of my kids,

20
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:44,004
I swear you'll never see me again!

21
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,772
Guaranteed, I won't see you again.

22
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:49,009
A Farrell killed Breece.

23
00:00:49,044 --> 00:00:50,644
I'm gonna find the guy who did it.

24
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:52,179
We're ready.

25
00:00:52,215 --> 00:00:54,982
You're good to me, and
I love you for that.

26
00:00:55,017 --> 00:00:57,551
Your tea's gonna get cold.

27
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:01,355
Is this what you were looking for?

28
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,558
This is witches' glove.
You killing him, G'win?

29
00:01:07,062 --> 00:01:09,863
Oh, God. What the hell
are you doing here?

30
00:01:09,898 --> 00:01:11,698
I am the one returned.

31
00:01:11,734 --> 00:01:14,301
The prophecy of lady Ray told it so.

32
00:01:14,337 --> 00:01:16,637
You're up to something, right?
You're up to something?

33
00:01:16,672 --> 00:01:18,472
- I can't figure it out.
- I ain't up to nothing.

34
00:01:18,508 --> 00:01:21,308
All right, now, you, your
time's come to an end.

35
00:01:21,344 --> 00:01:22,876
I warn you, be careful.

36
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:26,347
Because if we're caught,
it could mean banishment,

37
00:01:26,382 --> 00:01:29,416
or even worse.

38
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:40,058
Help me.

39
00:01:40,093 --> 00:01:43,261
Help me.

40
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:06,751
You sure are poorly.

41
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:09,588
Oh, no. No.

42
00:02:09,623 --> 00:02:12,123
I'm worse than poorly.

43
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:14,859
I can't hardly raise my bones.

44
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:18,597
It's best you stay settled in bed, then.

45
00:02:18,632 --> 00:02:21,165
No, I can't. Can't, can't, can't.

46
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:25,169
No. No, I gotta get Asa dead.

47
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:28,707
I got dark premonitions
about that devil.

48
00:02:35,348 --> 00:02:39,550
I know, sir. I appreciate
that it's late notice.

49
00:02:39,586 --> 00:02:42,420
Honestly, it's however
many men you can spare.

50
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:46,891
Yeah, that's great.

51
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:50,862
No, sir. That's... that's...
that's great.

52
00:02:50,897 --> 00:02:52,631
I'll have someone call you,

53
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,166
but we're planning on heading
up the mountain on Thursday.

54
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:57,068
All right. Thank you, sir.

55
00:02:57,104 --> 00:02:58,870
Okay, that's two men
from Christianville.

56
00:02:58,905 --> 00:03:00,304
How are you doing?

57
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,906
Well, we got one from Marston's Mills,

58
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:04,142
- one guy from miner.
- So where's that put us now?

59
00:03:04,177 --> 00:03:07,178
Well, with the 2 you just
got, that makes... 11.

60
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:11,049
That's just nowhere near enough.

61
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:12,651
We're gonna need at least 20.

62
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:15,920
I mean, we just got no idea
what we're walking into.

63
00:03:18,224 --> 00:03:20,091
You okay?

64
00:03:20,127 --> 00:03:22,226
Yeah, yeah.

65
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,229
No, I was...

66
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:29,969
I was just thinking about sheriff Weineke
and... your brother-in-law.

67
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,436
A lot of people aren't coming
back down that mountain alive.

68
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:36,507
Yeah, well, I mean...

69
00:03:36,543 --> 00:03:38,276
You're scared,

70
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:39,944
and... I don't blame you.

71
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,213
But someone's gotta do somethin'.

72
00:03:42,248 --> 00:03:44,515
When we take on this job,

73
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:46,450
we take on a responsibility.

74
00:03:48,288 --> 00:03:51,838
At a time like this, if we don't do
something, people gonna die.

75
00:03:54,441 --> 00:04:34,460
Outsiders 1x12 - All Hell

76
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:44,909
Are you certain this is how
you wanna deal with him?

77
00:04:44,945 --> 00:04:48,579
Don't go soft on me, lady.
It's gotta be done.

78
00:04:48,615 --> 00:04:50,248
I'm concerned about
what people will think

79
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:52,650
when they see you hunting
a man down like a dog.

80
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:54,652
I'm trying to people your
relationship with your people.

81
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:56,354
Sounds more like you're
trying to protect him.

82
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:59,090
Well, then you're not hearing me right.

83
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:02,593
I don't give a feather if
cousin Asa lives or dies.

84
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:05,429
That's cold talk, woman.

85
00:05:05,465 --> 00:05:08,166
But it warms me up fine.

86
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:13,304
I'm gonna talk to the
boys, get his ass found.

87
00:05:16,143 --> 00:05:18,509
- Morning, Krake.
- Morning.

88
00:05:23,884 --> 00:05:25,150
Good morning, G'win.

89
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:27,886
Morning.

90
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:30,688
I have apologies to give to you.

91
00:05:32,092 --> 00:05:33,391
For what?

92
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:36,828
For the man that I
was, the man I become.

93
00:05:39,432 --> 00:05:42,366
I should be the one apologizing to you.

94
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:46,137
I done terrible things...

95
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:48,306
I'm not talking about recent.

96
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:52,143
I'm talking about years past.

97
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:56,747
All that time wasted in weakness and...

98
00:05:56,783 --> 00:06:00,919
running after his
respect, long hours fr...

99
00:06:00,954 --> 00:06:02,887
fretting about losing your love.

100
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,657
It's all gone now.

101
00:06:06,693 --> 00:06:09,760
When I think about it, it's like
I'm contemplating a stranger.

102
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,734
So you've changed?

103
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:19,737
Listen, I just come here to tell you,

104
00:06:19,772 --> 00:06:23,074
no matter what happens,
you can always trust me.

105
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:26,644
Your secrets are safe with me.

106
00:06:29,415 --> 00:06:32,083
Is there anything you want to tell me?

107
00:08:03,343 --> 00:08:05,543
McGintuk,

108
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:06,811
Shay,

109
00:08:06,846 --> 00:08:08,512
Farrell,

110
00:08:08,548 --> 00:08:12,683
welcome here to celebrate
this last dawn of summer,

111
00:08:12,718 --> 00:08:15,219
and to honor our home,

112
00:08:15,255 --> 00:08:20,024
as our ancestors have done
for so many years before us.

113
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,859
Summer is done.

114
00:08:21,894 --> 00:08:24,695
The harvest comes, followed soon after

115
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,132
by the cold, quiet, death of winter.

116
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:31,702
Through it all, we are
sustained by our mother,

117
00:08:31,737 --> 00:08:33,404
our mountain.

118
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,775
So let us give her all praise and glory.

119
00:08:41,581 --> 00:08:45,716
For life, for sustenance, for balance,

120
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:47,485
we honor the mountain.

121
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,154
A-myrr waigh myrr.

122
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,390
A-myrr waigh myrr.

123
00:08:52,425 --> 00:08:55,659
For blessings, for riches,

124
00:08:55,695 --> 00:08:58,262
for your great, quiet majesty.

125
00:08:58,298 --> 00:09:01,165
A-myrr waigh myrr.

126
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:03,301
A-myrr waigh myrr.

127
00:09:05,038 --> 00:09:07,405
For now...

128
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,840
for then...

129
00:09:09,876 --> 00:09:11,942
for always.

130
00:09:18,118 --> 00:09:20,584
Our land gives us great strength,

131
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,754
but that strength alone
cannot sustain us.

132
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:26,391
It is our strength as a community

133
00:09:26,426 --> 00:09:28,459
that allows us to survive.

134
00:09:28,495 --> 00:09:31,462
Please turn now to the family
members nearest to you

135
00:09:31,498 --> 00:09:33,898
and offer them words or gestures

136
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:35,966
of fellowship and love.

137
00:09:43,143 --> 00:09:46,110
Asa wants a meeting.

138
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:47,412
All right.

139
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:50,481
A meeting at fuzzy Shay's old place.

140
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:53,284
Let the others know.

141
00:09:56,156 --> 00:09:58,089
You better get out of here.

142
00:09:58,124 --> 00:09:59,557
He's gonna grab you when this is over,

143
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:00,791
and he's gonna kill you.

144
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:08,166
Let us prepare now for
the chill of winter.

145
00:10:08,201 --> 00:10:09,967
A-waigh clan,

146
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:12,136
a good harvest to us all.

147
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:13,637
Ged-gedyah!

148
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:15,339
Ged-gedyah!

149
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:20,312
Take him.

150
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:30,354
- Shit.
- You see where he went?

151
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,324
Split off. We'll find him. Go.

152
00:10:47,362 --> 00:10:48,595
You're idiots.

153
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,866
He was right under your noses.

154
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,434
It's a miracle any of you can piss

155
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,637
seeing as you gotta
find your dick first.

156
00:10:55,673 --> 00:10:58,006
Do you wanna wait until he
slits my throat in the night?

157
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:00,830
I want him gone.

158
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:04,279
Split up. Search everywhere.

159
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:06,882
Every holler... check
the damn shit pile.

160
00:11:11,388 --> 00:11:13,321
Now you.

161
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:16,058
And you, too, you... you come with me.

162
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:23,065
Hey, sheriff.

163
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,800
Can I help you?

164
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:26,735
Yeah, I'm just coming to see you.

165
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,504
That guy who killed Breece, you got him?

166
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:31,973
Nope, not yet.

167
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:34,542
Right, but you told us
he'd be in custody by now.

168
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:36,544
Did I? Yeah, well, I was wrong.

169
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,180
Taking a little longer than we thought.

170
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:40,248
So you don't got him?

171
00:11:41,585 --> 00:11:42,918
No.

172
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,020
That's all we needed to know.

173
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:48,090
You think you done
enough damage already?

174
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,893
You stay out of our way.
You let us handle it.

175
00:11:59,436 --> 00:12:01,103
You okay?

176
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,605
I have no bars.

177
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,907
Well, we got us a bar up in the barn.

178
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:07,809
You want something to drink?

179
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,047
Never mind.

180
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:13,882
I am thirsty, though.

181
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:17,753
All right, well, I'll head on up there.

182
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:19,454
- I'll get you somethin'.
- Okay, I'll go with you.

183
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,923
Hey, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey.

184
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,860
Let me go. I'll take care of you.
You my guest, right?

185
00:12:24,895 --> 00:12:26,928
I wanna look around.

186
00:12:26,964 --> 00:12:29,564
And I'm tired of waiting for
that Krake guy to come back.

187
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:31,800
What? You're saying you're bored?

188
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,802
Is that it?

189
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,738
No. I'm not bored.

190
00:12:36,774 --> 00:12:38,640
I just wanna take a walk.

191
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,608
- Well, you can't.
- Why not?

192
00:12:40,644 --> 00:12:42,978
'Cause I told you there's
things going on up here.

193
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,612
Look, you ain't from here.

194
00:12:44,648 --> 00:12:47,149
Right? I gotta get a lot
of folks used to the idea

195
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,050
of a stranger being around.

196
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:52,754
And I'll do it, but I need you
to give me a little bit of time.

197
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,158
- Come on.
- Okay.

198
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:58,226
But I didn't come up here
to live under a tree.

199
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:04,956
Hasil. Are you listening to me?

200
00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:07,769
I need you to get underneath
that blanket and be quiet.

201
00:13:07,805 --> 00:13:09,570
- Why?
- Just...

202
00:13:09,606 --> 00:13:12,607
Hasil.

203
00:13:12,642 --> 00:13:16,111
All this time, Krake, you've
been telling us to trust Asa.

204
00:13:16,146 --> 00:13:18,646
He said Big Foster would never get guns.

205
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:21,917
Now he's got more fire than
he knows what to do with.

206
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:23,518
Oh. He'll figure out
what to do with them,

207
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,120
believe you me.

208
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:26,788
How are we supposed to
fight big Foster now?

209
00:13:26,824 --> 00:13:29,858
Can we just wait for Asa, please?

210
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:33,195
Asa's our leader. I'm sure
he'll have an answer.

211
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,863
Asa's your leader?

212
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:39,701
Is that true?

213
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,205
Well, it seems my
premonitions were correct.

214
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,273
I thought I was your leader.

215
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:48,067
What was it you said, Shurn?

216
00:13:48,267 --> 00:13:50,111
"How are we supposed
to fight Big Foster?"

217
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:52,113
You heard me.

218
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:54,049
Asa's your leader.

219
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,151
So here you all are.

220
00:13:56,186 --> 00:13:58,854
Your minds poisoned by Asa.

221
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:03,458
All in defiance of your Bren'in.

222
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:05,160
Take 'em to the barn.

223
00:14:05,195 --> 00:14:06,862
Keep a guard on 'em.

224
00:14:06,897 --> 00:14:10,265
Any of them try to escape,
you shoot them dead.

225
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,902
Especially this one.

226
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:19,307
Go. Come on.

227
00:14:33,056 --> 00:14:34,923
I need your help.

228
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:41,897
He's got men all over the mountain.

229
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:45,233
There's a man two stones' throw
from here hidden up in a tree.

230
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:47,235
I'm not sure there's
much I can do for you.

231
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:49,204
But you will help me?

232
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:51,606
You saved my life.

233
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,241
The fact that you done that

234
00:14:53,277 --> 00:14:55,176
when most people here wouldn't
even look me in the eye?

235
00:14:55,212 --> 00:14:58,113
That won't soon be forgotten, cousin.

236
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,282
All right.

237
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,183
So what do we do?

238
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:04,352
The way that I figure it, you
got two options right now.

239
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:06,454
You gotta get off this mountain or die.

240
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,390
He's sick. Could be dying.

241
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:10,725
He's got it set in his head that
he ain't going to his grave

242
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,261
until you go to yours.

243
00:15:13,297 --> 00:15:15,730
I thought I could beat him.

244
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:19,100
You know, like I was so
much smarter than him.

245
00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:22,103
Like it was gonna be so easy.

246
00:15:22,628 --> 00:15:25,159
I had destiny on my side, right?

247
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:28,476
My destiny's exactly what you say it is.

248
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,246
Either I go or I die.

249
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:34,849
Then let's find you some safe
passage off this mountain.

250
00:15:37,454 --> 00:15:40,088
How do I know you're not gonna
run straight to your father

251
00:15:40,123 --> 00:15:41,622
and hand me over to him?

252
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:43,425
Maybe you didn't hear
what I said before.

253
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,060
Are you giving me up?

254
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:46,794
That'd go a long way to
mending your relationship.

255
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,296
That man is dead to me.

256
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,435
There ain't no mending that.

257
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,106
Foster.

258
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:03,211
You're a good man.

259
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,920
Bren'in! Got you somethin'.

260
00:16:12,956 --> 00:16:15,590
Well, come. You got me Asa?

261
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,159
Not Asa.

262
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,997
Well, well, well.

263
00:16:22,032 --> 00:16:24,832
Look who we found at last.

264
00:16:24,868 --> 00:16:27,602
- Yeah, come here...
- Get off of me!

265
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:34,142
He had that bitch hid away.

266
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:36,611
- Shut up.
- Hey, hey, oh.

267
00:16:36,646 --> 00:16:38,213
Doesn't seem like to me,

268
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,015
this is the place for you
to be talking large.

269
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,683
No! Leave him alone!

270
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:44,852
Yeah, so you tell your
friend about the last time

271
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:47,355
you and I made acquaintance?
You remember that?

272
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:49,857
When I was all chained up in a box.

273
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:52,293
And you come to burn me alive.
You remember that?

274
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:54,496
- You're hurting him! Hey!
- Wait, wait, wait...

275
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:57,332
It's okay. It's all right.

276
00:16:57,367 --> 00:17:00,001
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

277
00:17:00,037 --> 00:17:02,404
Just simmer down, okay?

278
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:05,407
You're a guest in my home, okay?

279
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,708
Don't you go pushing me.

280
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:11,212
That ain't polite.

281
00:17:11,248 --> 00:17:15,483
Oh... oh, get him up.

282
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,860
You are something else, boy.

283
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:29,497
And by that, I mean, you are
the king of the dumb shits.

284
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:31,599
First, you got caught stealing from us,

285
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,069
now you got caught
bringing in an outsider.

286
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:36,204
She's a good person. She
don't mean nobody...

287
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:38,906
she don't mean no... she
don't mean nobody no harm.

288
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:41,742
Last outsider come up here said
the same thing, didn't he?

289
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:45,080
Right. We all know what happened to him.

290
00:17:45,115 --> 00:17:48,083
- Wait, what? Wait, what?
- Hey, hey, hey.

291
00:17:48,118 --> 00:17:49,717
- Wait, what?
- Get 'em out of here.

292
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:51,186
- Hasil. Hasil.
- Lock 'em up with the others.

293
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:54,889
Hasil! Hasil!

294
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:57,292
Hell...

295
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:00,562
this keeps up...

296
00:18:00,597 --> 00:18:06,067
...won't likely be anybody
left walking around here free.

297
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:12,107
Yeah, last time we talked
to that damn sheriff,

298
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:13,941
he said he was gonna
have the man in custody.

299
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:15,977
And, of course, he has not done it.

300
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,612
Yeah, that's right. I
just talked to him.

301
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:19,814
We can't sit on this no longer.

302
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,949
It's an insult to Breece's memory.

303
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:24,319
Doing nothing and letting them
get away with killing him?

304
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,287
We got us a big group together now.

305
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:27,989
Ain't gonna be just the three of us.

306
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,890
Tomorrow, at 5 in the afternoon,

307
00:18:29,926 --> 00:18:31,593
we're gonna be meeting
and head up that trail

308
00:18:31,628 --> 00:18:33,228
by eno white's place.

309
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:34,762
Could you please close the door?

310
00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:40,801
Okay, go ahead.

311
00:18:40,837 --> 00:18:43,571
Okay, we got weapons, but
we need ammo, kerosene.

312
00:18:43,607 --> 00:18:45,206
We need money.

313
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:48,643
Gentlemen, what you're suggesting here

314
00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:50,245
is highly illegal.

315
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,747
If I was involved in any way,

316
00:18:52,782 --> 00:18:55,683
even if people knew I was a
party to this conversation,

317
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,953
it could be extremely
damaging for my career.

318
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:02,123
So I am going to forget
that you came here.

319
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:05,260
And I'm going to leave my office.

320
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:09,197
And I'm going to ask
that you please not look

321
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:11,132
in the top left-hand drawer of my desk

322
00:19:11,168 --> 00:19:14,202
where there's an envelope
containing $1,000 in petty cash.

323
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,704
You have a great day.

324
00:19:20,843 --> 00:19:23,211
I mean, we're supposed to
take the money, right?

325
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:24,979
Idiot.

326
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:38,125
On your feet, all of you.

327
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:39,994
Your Bren'in is here.

328
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,066
Here they are.

329
00:19:47,404 --> 00:19:49,504
You believe me now?

330
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:54,709
I gotta say...

331
00:19:54,744 --> 00:19:56,244
I'm hurt.

332
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,214
'Cause some of ya, I
knowed since we was kids.

333
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:03,017
I laughed with some of you,
I cried with some of you.

334
00:20:05,388 --> 00:20:09,524
Your queen talks to
me about many things,

335
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:12,594
including forgiveness.

336
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:16,197
So I'm gonna heed her word

337
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:19,200
and I'm going to forgive you all.

338
00:20:19,236 --> 00:20:23,605
But in order to earn my mercy,

339
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,906
y'all gotta do

340
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:28,909
one simple thing.

341
00:20:30,547 --> 00:20:31,946
Tell me where he is.

342
00:20:35,324 --> 00:20:36,706
Nobody?

343
00:20:37,387 --> 00:20:39,920
Well, I know somebody here knows.

344
00:20:39,956 --> 00:20:41,422
Our world ain't that big.

345
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,591
So I'm gonna ask you one more time...

346
00:20:43,627 --> 00:20:45,627
where is Asa?

347
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,596
We were expecting him at the meeting.

348
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:50,164
He never showed himself.

349
00:20:52,068 --> 00:20:56,471
Well, that don't answer my question.

350
00:20:56,506 --> 00:21:00,207
But I ain't gonna get angry
and I ain't gonna yell.

351
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:03,077
I'm gonna give you a whole
day to think on it,

352
00:21:03,112 --> 00:21:06,547
and then I'm gonna come back
and I'm gonna ask you again.

353
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,883
And I still don't get an answer...

354
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:12,253
then I'm gonna have to kill one of you.

355
00:21:15,158 --> 00:21:19,059
And, Krake, it's gonna be you.

356
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,723
Dinner's up. You gonna come eat?

357
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,592
No, I'm good.

358
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:39,929
Well, apart from being pretty salty,

359
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:41,663
I think it might actually be quite good.

360
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:43,933
I mean, the kids thought
it sucked, but...

361
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,005
Since when do you drink beer?

362
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,173
It's one of Breece's.

363
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,575
Didn't wanna throw it away.
That didn't seem right.

364
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,946
Yeah, sure.

365
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:01,750
I don't know, Wade.

366
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:17,066
Feel like I wasted a lot
of years at that church.

367
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:20,803
All that praying and
thinking about the almighty.

368
00:22:20,838 --> 00:22:24,373
And then... when I need him,

369
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,575
he's nowhere to be found.

370
00:22:28,813 --> 00:22:31,247
I mean, I stopped doing the
church thing after dad,

371
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:33,282
so I'm about the worst
person in the world

372
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:34,984
- to talk to about that.
- Damn it!

373
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:36,552
Okay.

374
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:41,958
It's okay.

375
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,827
It's okay, it's okay.

376
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:47,663
It's not okay.

377
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,901
It's gonna take time, you know.
It's gonna take a lot of time.

378
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,839
I know.

379
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:58,274
I know that.

380
00:23:07,551 --> 00:23:09,952
We're getting close to
the guy who did it.

381
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,621
- Really?
- Yeah. It might not help,

382
00:23:12,656 --> 00:23:14,690
but it's gonna be something
in the face of not being able

383
00:23:14,725 --> 00:23:16,459
to do a goddamn thing.

384
00:23:19,921 --> 00:23:20,963
I'm sorry.

385
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,966
- I'm okay.
- It's okay. I know.

386
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,468
- I'm fine.
- It's okay.

387
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:28,004
- I mean, I'm not fine.
- I know.

388
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,241
Okay, come on. Let's go eat.

389
00:23:35,546 --> 00:23:38,147
I'm gonna stay out here
and wait for somebody

390
00:23:38,182 --> 00:23:40,316
to run over that bottle and get a flat.

391
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:45,488
I can't be the only one
suffering like this.

392
00:23:47,191 --> 00:23:49,125
All right, well, I'm gonna
go in and get a plate

393
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,559
and come join you and watch.

394
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,548
Foster?

395
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,216
Foster, you there?

396
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:17,586
Well, hey there.

397
00:24:17,621 --> 00:24:20,923
I hope you're going to
suppress the urge to run back

398
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,259
to your husband and tell him where I am.

399
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,228
I'll try.

400
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,600
I know you're killing him.

401
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:37,339
At first, I didn't believe it.

402
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:41,077
But then, it all made sense.

403
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:45,081
You marrying him, giving
yourself up to him.

404
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:48,184
It wasn't for power.

405
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:50,919
It was for the good of the clan.

406
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:56,092
I mean, you love this place.

407
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,593
These people.

408
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:07,336
I thought I could change him.

409
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:10,939
Soften him.

410
00:25:10,975 --> 00:25:13,775
And now, this choice that I made, well,

411
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:16,745
half the time I feel
like I'm the one dying.

412
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,914
I forced you to make that choice.

413
00:25:18,949 --> 00:25:20,616
How?

414
00:25:20,651 --> 00:25:22,718
By coming back.

415
00:25:22,753 --> 00:25:25,854
I mean, everything was fine and
peaceful before I showed up.

416
00:25:27,691 --> 00:25:29,558
Well, what's done is done, Asa.

417
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,727
And I have to worry about now.

418
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:35,598
About our survival, about the prisoners.

419
00:25:36,934 --> 00:25:39,835
Say what now? What you
mean, "prisoners"?

420
00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:42,571
Your group.

421
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,473
The people plotting against Foster.

422
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,308
He captured them. He's
holding them in the barn.

423
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:50,012
He threatened to kill Krake
unless you're found.

424
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:54,183
Oh, my God.

425
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,120
Goodbye, Asa.

426
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:09,831
Haylie Grimes, yeah.

427
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:13,302
- Haylie, Donoushee.
- Hello, Don.

428
00:26:13,337 --> 00:26:15,538
To what do I owe the
pleasure, Mr. Boss man?

429
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:18,006
Well, congratulations, lady.

430
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:20,276
What wonderful thing have I done today?

431
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:22,545
You got your cop friend
off his bony ass.

432
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,680
The sheriff over in
Sherwood's a pal of mine.

433
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:26,549
He got a call today from your
sheriff there in Blackburg

434
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,217
looking for men to go up the mountain

435
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:30,986
and get those hillbilly assholes down.

436
00:26:31,021 --> 00:26:34,190
Oh, right. I was just about to
call and tell you the good news.

437
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:35,991
Going up day after tomorrow.

438
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:37,793
It's a win/win for us either way.

439
00:26:37,828 --> 00:26:39,795
- How do you mean?
- Well, either the cops

440
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,030
get the freaks off the
mountain and we win,

441
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:44,233
or the freaks shoot and
kill one of the cops

442
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:47,503
and it turns into a situation
for the Feds, and we win.

443
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,972
Sweet?

444
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:53,008
That's damn sweet, Don.

445
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,495
Your father's holding prisoners.

446
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:15,497
I have to help them.

447
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:20,068
First things first, cousin.
We gotta talk other plans.

448
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:40,422
Oh, get me something, woman.

449
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:45,628
Can't you see I'm in pain here?

450
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,563
Don't rush me, Foster.

451
00:27:47,598 --> 00:27:49,097
I gotta do this right.

452
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:50,766
I could make you sicker than you are.

453
00:27:50,801 --> 00:27:53,602
I can't be sicker than I am.

454
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:57,306
What... what is wrong with me?

455
00:27:57,341 --> 00:28:02,811
I'm just... I'm just surrounded
by vipers and thieves and liars.

456
00:28:02,846 --> 00:28:05,414
When all I'm trying to do is guide them

457
00:28:05,449 --> 00:28:09,217
from darkness into the light.

458
00:28:09,253 --> 00:28:12,388
Okay. Okay, here. Sit up.

459
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:14,790
You're gonna drink this.
You're gonna drink it quickly.

460
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:17,326
It's gonna taste awful, but
it's gonna get the job done.

461
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:21,129
- Believe you me.
- Oh... Just give it to me.

462
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,900
Fa!

463
00:28:24,935 --> 00:28:27,469
Are you... are you out of your mind?

464
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,104
- I got him.
- Storming here like that.

465
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:30,472
I got him! The lostie.

466
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:31,973
He's in my tent right now. Come on.

467
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:33,776
- All... all right.
- He's tied up. Let's go.

468
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:35,277
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

469
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,845
Just get my boys, all right?

470
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,747
You get them a gun.

471
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:42,968
Okay.

472
00:28:42,969 --> 00:28:44,252
Let's go.

473
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:06,141
Come on, Fa. Go on. He's
in there, go on. Inside.

474
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:14,983
- He ain't here.
- He's gone.

475
00:29:15,018 --> 00:29:17,953
What the hell is going on, boy?

476
00:29:17,988 --> 00:29:19,621
I don't know, Fa. He was in there.

477
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:20,989
I had him tied up.

478
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,058
I don't see no ropes.

479
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:25,227
Yeah, well, maybe he took them with him.

480
00:29:27,531 --> 00:29:30,065
I want that demon. I want him...

481
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,167
Hey, all right, hey.

482
00:29:32,202 --> 00:29:34,336
Go get G'win. Get G'win, go on!

483
00:30:41,157 --> 00:30:43,780
Thank you, cousin.

484
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:46,515
I thought you might do
something like that.

485
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,518
We need to get you out of here
and get you somewhere safe.

486
00:30:49,553 --> 00:30:51,954
There ain't nowhere
safe on this mountain

487
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,223
until that lunatic's out of here.

488
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:55,591
Where's Krake?

489
00:30:55,626 --> 00:30:58,761
They took him to the box.

490
00:30:58,796 --> 00:31:00,596
Foster's gonna kill him.

491
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,799
Shit.

492
00:31:03,834 --> 00:31:05,434
Take this, and you take them

493
00:31:05,469 --> 00:31:07,536
a half a mile beyond Chalk Falls,

494
00:31:07,571 --> 00:31:09,272
and there's a little mine.

495
00:31:09,307 --> 00:31:11,274
I want you to hide there and
wait for my all clear, okay?

496
00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:14,443
Go, go. You four, you stay with me.

497
00:31:14,478 --> 00:31:17,380
Enoch's got himself a bum leg.
Why don't you let me take them?

498
00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:20,983
No, Hasil, I need you and
these four men, okay?

499
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:23,152
Look, I gotta go get Krake.

500
00:31:23,187 --> 00:31:24,753
I'll explain it to you on the way.

501
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:26,822
Come on, let's go.

502
00:31:30,194 --> 00:31:32,494
Hey. Hey, you go on with them.

503
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,963
It's all right.

504
00:31:39,804 --> 00:31:42,405
Hey, Sally-Ann. Hey. Hey!

505
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,606
Hey.

506
00:31:44,642 --> 00:31:46,575
Where you going? You're
going the wrong way.

507
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,610
- I'm going home.
- You can't... What are you...?

508
00:31:48,646 --> 00:31:50,646
You can't walk down the
mountain by yourself

509
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:51,948
in the middle of the night.

510
00:31:51,983 --> 00:31:53,449
You're gonna fall and break your neck.

511
00:31:53,484 --> 00:31:57,119
- I'll take my chances.
- Listen, hey. Hey!

512
00:31:57,155 --> 00:31:59,355
- You lied to me!
- Hasil! Hasil.

513
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,656
Just...

514
00:32:00,691 --> 00:32:02,124
you told me it was beautiful up here.

515
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,193
You said that it was
all skies and stars.

516
00:32:04,228 --> 00:32:06,795
It was. It was that way.

517
00:32:06,831 --> 00:32:09,865
But it's just going crazy
on account of big.

518
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,901
I'm begging you, please, go with them.

519
00:32:16,174 --> 00:32:17,806
Goodbye, Hasil.

520
00:32:17,842 --> 00:32:19,808
No, you can't.

521
00:32:19,844 --> 00:32:22,011
If you don't know where you're going,

522
00:32:22,046 --> 00:32:23,745
you're going to get yourself killed.

523
00:32:28,052 --> 00:32:30,052
Come with me then.

524
00:32:30,088 --> 00:32:32,554
Come with me.

525
00:32:36,961 --> 00:32:39,462
My family needs me.

526
00:33:08,726 --> 00:33:10,692
Damn it, Krake.

527
00:33:10,728 --> 00:33:13,195
I'll get it. I just gotta
find the right rock.

528
00:33:13,231 --> 00:33:16,232
Trust me, cousin, you've been
at it since the dark of night.

529
00:33:16,267 --> 00:33:18,634
That thing won't never yield.

530
00:33:18,669 --> 00:33:20,869
You sound pretty sure about that.

531
00:33:20,905 --> 00:33:23,105
I built this box.

532
00:33:23,141 --> 00:33:24,573
I'm a good man at the still,

533
00:33:24,608 --> 00:33:26,808
but my ironwork's where I really shine,

534
00:33:26,844 --> 00:33:29,245
as you're finding out.

535
00:33:31,349 --> 00:33:33,649
I wanna hold the first brief at 9 A.M.

536
00:33:33,684 --> 00:33:35,384
A few of the guys can't
get here till then,

537
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,885
so that's when it's gonna be.

538
00:33:36,921 --> 00:33:38,554
Knock, knock.

539
00:33:38,589 --> 00:33:40,289
Yeah, what can I do for you?

540
00:33:40,324 --> 00:33:42,591
Could I speak to you in private?

541
00:33:42,626 --> 00:33:45,394
No. Sit down.

542
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,597
Anything you wanna say to me,
you say in front of him.

543
00:33:51,469 --> 00:33:53,169
I'm sorry to interrupt you boys.

544
00:33:53,204 --> 00:33:55,471
I know you have big plans for tomorrow.

545
00:33:58,276 --> 00:33:59,675
How'd you know about that?

546
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,010
I know all sorts of things.

547
00:34:02,046 --> 00:34:04,680
But I'm here today, sheriff,
as a concerned citizen.

548
00:34:04,715 --> 00:34:06,848
It came to my attention
that a group of local men

549
00:34:06,884 --> 00:34:08,517
are planning to start some trouble

550
00:34:08,553 --> 00:34:10,319
up on the mountain today.

551
00:34:10,354 --> 00:34:12,654
Now I know for a fact
they're gathering at 5:00,

552
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,624
and they're gonna go up a trail
behind eno somebody's place.

553
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,159
Do you know where that might be?

554
00:34:17,195 --> 00:34:18,794
So how do you know this?

555
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:21,029
Told you, sheriff, I know
all sorts of things.

556
00:34:24,068 --> 00:34:27,269
You know, I mean, I know
all sorts of things, too.

557
00:34:27,305 --> 00:34:28,870
I'm sure you do.

558
00:34:28,906 --> 00:34:31,340
I know who each of these men are.

559
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:33,375
And... I know they
were all in a meeting

560
00:34:33,411 --> 00:34:35,144
in your office yesterday.

561
00:34:37,148 --> 00:34:38,947
Are you having me followed?

562
00:34:38,983 --> 00:34:42,351
No, I'm having them watched.

563
00:34:42,386 --> 00:34:45,121
But everywhere they go,

564
00:34:45,156 --> 00:34:47,389
you keep popping up.

565
00:34:49,994 --> 00:34:51,927
You're under arrest.

566
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,032
Are you kidding me?

567
00:34:58,902 --> 00:35:00,503
Nope.

568
00:35:00,538 --> 00:35:02,304
I'm under arrest?

569
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,740
Yeah.

570
00:35:04,775 --> 00:35:08,010
Okay, well, tell me, Barney
Fife, what's the charge?

571
00:35:08,045 --> 00:35:11,413
That's good. I like that joke.

572
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:13,482
I haven't decided on which charge yet.

573
00:35:13,518 --> 00:35:14,850
I got a few to choose from, though...

574
00:35:14,885 --> 00:35:16,519
I got accessory, I got conspiracy,

575
00:35:16,554 --> 00:35:18,420
I got inciting a riot, but
I think I'm gonna go with

576
00:35:18,456 --> 00:35:20,489
unlawful possession of a narcotic.

577
00:35:20,525 --> 00:35:23,159
What in the hell are you talking about?

578
00:35:23,194 --> 00:35:25,528
You dropped me off a little
gift basket a little while ago?

579
00:35:25,563 --> 00:35:27,029
Had some oxycontin in it.

580
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:31,833
I mean, if you got a
prescription for that,

581
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:33,435
then you got nothing to worry about.

582
00:35:33,471 --> 00:35:35,437
But I'm guessing you don't.
So stand up, turn around,

583
00:35:35,473 --> 00:35:37,072
put your hands behind your back.

584
00:35:44,215 --> 00:35:46,748
Dope fiend hick son of a bitch.

585
00:35:46,784 --> 00:35:48,684
That's right.

586
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,686
I'm a regular triple threat.

587
00:35:50,721 --> 00:35:52,521
You can take her away to the cells.

588
00:35:52,557 --> 00:35:57,926
I'm gonna get started on
this goddamn paperwork.

589
00:36:01,499 --> 00:36:03,865
Shit.

590
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,308
Your time of judgment has come, Krake.

591
00:36:12,343 --> 00:36:15,077
- You said it'd be a full day.
- Get up!

592
00:36:15,112 --> 00:36:17,580
Well, your fellow jackals...

593
00:36:17,615 --> 00:36:19,615
they escaped and run off last night.

594
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,983
And my urge to punish is
too strong to contain.

595
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:23,919
Get him out of there.

596
00:36:26,957 --> 00:36:29,991
- I ain't gonna beg you none!
- Wouldn't help anyhow.

597
00:36:30,027 --> 00:36:33,128
Yeah, on your knees, scoundrel.

598
00:36:33,163 --> 00:36:36,064
Not gonna spend my last moments
on this beautiful earth

599
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,900
trying to reach the heart
of a man who don't got one.

600
00:36:40,204 --> 00:36:41,803
Foster, please, you
ain't thinking right.

601
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,405
Don't you talk against me.

602
00:36:43,441 --> 00:36:46,642
I am thinking clear as day.

603
00:36:57,788 --> 00:37:00,689
Get off me.

604
00:37:11,068 --> 00:37:14,836
I'm fine. Fine.

605
00:37:14,872 --> 00:37:17,939
Bren'in, you want us to shoot him?

606
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:19,508
No.

607
00:37:19,543 --> 00:37:21,176
No, damn it.

608
00:37:21,211 --> 00:37:26,482
I can do it.

609
00:37:32,923 --> 00:37:35,023
Foster?

610
00:37:37,328 --> 00:37:39,060
Foster?

611
00:37:47,271 --> 00:37:49,838
No.

612
00:37:49,873 --> 00:37:53,041
No, get him...

613
00:37:53,076 --> 00:37:54,576
get him back in the box.

614
00:37:54,612 --> 00:37:56,745
But, Bren'in...

615
00:37:56,781 --> 00:38:00,048
Do as I say.

616
00:38:43,851 --> 00:38:45,617
How are you doing it?

617
00:38:45,652 --> 00:38:48,620
How'd you get out of there

618
00:38:48,655 --> 00:38:50,890
leaving the ground undisturbed?

619
00:38:50,925 --> 00:38:53,092
Tell me.

620
00:38:55,329 --> 00:38:58,097
You hateful,

621
00:38:58,132 --> 00:38:59,932
dried-up...

622
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:02,968
whore bitch.

623
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,741
I put you in there.

624
00:39:09,777 --> 00:39:12,077
I put you in there.

625
00:39:12,113 --> 00:39:13,779
I know...

626
00:39:13,814 --> 00:39:15,981
I put you...

627
00:39:16,017 --> 00:39:17,582
I put you...

628
00:39:17,618 --> 00:39:19,184
- Foster.
- I put you...

629
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,353
Foster, Foster, what are you doing?

630
00:39:21,389 --> 00:39:23,822
What are you doing?

631
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,028
G'win. Oh, G'win.

632
00:39:29,063 --> 00:39:30,796
What is it?

633
00:39:30,831 --> 00:39:32,731
What is it?

634
00:39:34,802 --> 00:39:39,371
Oh, I'm lost. I'm lost,
I'm lost to this world.

635
00:39:39,407 --> 00:39:42,774
She's after me... after me,

636
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,609
to join her in hell for what I done.

637
00:39:50,918 --> 00:39:52,318
What have you done?

638
00:39:52,353 --> 00:39:54,853
If I speak the words...

639
00:39:57,058 --> 00:40:00,025
My shame will consume me.

640
00:40:01,895 --> 00:40:05,130
Look at me. Look at me.

641
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:07,333
I'm here. I'm right here.
I'm right here.

642
00:40:07,368 --> 00:40:11,470
- G'win, G'win...
- I'm right here.

643
00:40:11,505 --> 00:40:14,573
You can tell me.

644
00:40:14,608 --> 00:40:16,942
I won't judge you.

645
00:40:21,682 --> 00:40:23,082
I love you.

646
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:28,620
You love me?

647
00:40:33,861 --> 00:40:37,096
I killed her.

648
00:40:37,131 --> 00:40:39,264
My mother.

649
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,935
I killed her... dead.

650
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:48,173
I'm sorry.

651
00:40:57,451 --> 00:40:59,584
I forgive you.

652
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,754
Now there's a heartwarming sight.

653
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:07,159
What are you doing here?

654
00:41:09,296 --> 00:41:11,596
You want me dead, old man?

655
00:41:11,632 --> 00:41:15,600
Well, there's a lot of other
people involved in that now.

656
00:41:17,238 --> 00:41:20,572
So why don't we just
make it simple, Foster?

657
00:41:20,607 --> 00:41:22,474
You and me.

658
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,910
Right here, right now.

659
00:41:27,614 --> 00:41:30,649
Get ready to die.

660
00:41:34,422 --> 00:41:36,155
Hey there, folks.

661
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,457
What in the heck are y'all doing here?

662
00:41:40,928 --> 00:41:43,995
Caught y'all bird watching?

663
00:41:44,031 --> 00:41:45,630
We-we're just bird watching, too.

664
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:48,167
You know what we're doing here, sheriff.

665
00:41:48,202 --> 00:41:50,469
- You ain't stopping us.
- I think I am, pat.

666
00:41:50,504 --> 00:41:52,637
All of y'all turn around and
go back home right now.

667
00:41:52,673 --> 00:41:54,940
Hey! Hey!

668
00:41:54,975 --> 00:41:58,510
All right! Any one of you fire
at me again, I will open up!

669
00:41:58,546 --> 00:42:01,146
Drop your weapons now!

670
00:42:01,182 --> 00:42:03,148
I will unload on you!

671
00:42:03,184 --> 00:42:06,151
Goddamn it, you bunch of morons!
You're all under arrest!

672
00:42:06,187 --> 00:42:07,786
Everybody put your weapons down now!

673
00:42:07,821 --> 00:42:09,721
Weapons down on the ground!

674
00:42:13,994 --> 00:42:15,527
What? You're gonna shoot me?

675
00:42:15,563 --> 00:42:18,763
You're gonna shoot an unarmed man?

676
00:42:18,799 --> 00:42:20,599
You fear me that much, Foster? Really?

677
00:42:20,634 --> 00:42:22,667
This ain't right. He's... he's not well.

678
00:42:25,306 --> 00:42:27,639
I could be...

679
00:42:27,674 --> 00:42:29,808
...half-hour dead,

680
00:42:29,843 --> 00:42:32,010
and I'd still kill you.

681
00:42:32,045 --> 00:42:34,813
Guess we'll find out in half an hour.

682
00:43:15,623 --> 00:43:18,524
Go ahead. Finish me.

683
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:21,726
As you wish.

684
00:43:38,145 --> 00:43:40,779
No. Let him be.

685
00:43:40,814 --> 00:43:42,714
He's dead.

686
00:43:42,749 --> 00:43:46,117
No, he don't belong here.

687
00:43:46,153 --> 00:43:48,086
Help me, G'win.

688
00:43:48,121 --> 00:43:50,455
Okay.

689
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:26,491
It's done.

690
00:44:28,795 --> 00:44:31,129
Everything will be better now.
