1
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,953
Why? Why can't I...?

2
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,516
That's not the answer.

3
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,275
I just can't flap my wings fast enough.

4
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,676
Maybe seagulls can't fly
faster than 62 miles per hour.

5
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,272
But wouldn't it be great if we could?

6
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,434
I wonder how high I could really fly,

7
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,478
what the world would look like
from way up there.

8
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,233
My wings are heavy.

9
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,675
I don't feel steady.

10
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,833
I didn't fall all the way.

11
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,991
I can do it.

12
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,839
I've got to make it higher
than anyone's ever flown before.

13
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,797
I can.

14
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,273
I can see everywhere.

15
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,990
How am I gonna tell them?
How am I gonna say it?

16
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,870
Mother, Father...

17
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,075
...I hope you'll understand.

18
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,068
This time you have to.

19
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,789
I've found things
that will change our lives.

20
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,673
There's such a world out there.

21
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,477
None of us
have ever seen it or felt it.

22
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,029
I've just flown up today
higher than we ever fly,

23
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,998
far above the highest clouds.

24
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,110
But you can see.

25
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,874
I mean, you can see everywhere.

26
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,790
For the first time in my life
I see where we live.

27
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,989
Son, we looked everywhere
for you the last few days.

28
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,440
The elders in the flock
are talking about you.

29
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,034
They know you fly off on your own,

30
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,713
where we never fly.

31
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,633
They don't understand it.
They will not allow it.

32
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,509
Not allow me to learn? Why?

33
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,638
Oh, I can understand
your dreams, Jonathan.

34
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,837
We all dream of better things
when we're young.

35
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,309
I'm afraid...

36
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,038
...for you.

37
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,316
I'm afraid of what you're doing.

38
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,631
Maybe this isn't the best life,
but it's all we know.

39
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,631
Winter's coming.

40
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,360
The flock must stay together to survive.

41
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,114
We were meant
to live the way we live, accept it.

42
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,713
Take your place.

43
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,791
Will you try, Son?

44
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,633
If you don't,
we will have all lived for nothing.

45
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,234
We weren't meant to live this way.

46
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,709
I know you're wrong.

47
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,270
But... I'll try.

48
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,634
Maybe the secret is fixed wings.

49
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,439
Flap up to 50
and hold the wings still.

50
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,318
I'll bet that's it.

51
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,835
Fifty and still.

52
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,198
It won't hurt anybody
if I try that. Will it?

53
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,238
It won't hurt anybody,
take away anybody's freedom

54
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,836
if I just slip out and give it a try.

55
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,718
Nothing to worry about.

56
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,110
Just a very simple thing here.

57
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,831
I'm going to make a simple dive,
to 50 miles per hour

58
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,515
and hold the wings steady
and go straight on down.

59
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,511
Here we go.

60
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,193
This is it.

61
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,237
Thirty, 40, 50...

62
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,630
No. No! Pull out!

63
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,552
I... I can't do it.

64
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,915
I'll be killed.

65
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,439
What is this? I'm afraid.

66
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,196
I'm on the right way of doing this,
and I'm afraid.

67
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,998
So, what are you going to do?

68
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,073
You going to glide around here for
the rest of your life without trying?

69
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,756
If you're scared, go back to the flock
where everyone else is scared too.

70
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,433
Sixty... 70.

71
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,797
Faster than any seagull has ever...

72
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,678
Pull!

73
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,310
There's got to be more
to life than fighting

74
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,632
for some fish head somewhere.

75
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,519
There's no way around it.

76
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,309
If I was meant to learn
so much about flying,

77
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,313
I'd have charts for brains.

78
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,110
If I were meant to fly fast,
I'd have a falcon's short wings,

79
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,432
live on mice instead of fish.

80
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,398
I've got to live with what I am.

81
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,633
I promise this day
that I will be a seagull...

82
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,078
...like every other seagull.

83
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,076
Does my life end here?

84
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,640
I can't believe that.

85
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,190
I wasn't born to drown in this ocean.

86
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,633
I can die here,

87
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,510
or I can force myself to fly.

88
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,478
It's in me.

89
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,999
It's in me!

90
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,319
I've got to try.

91
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,156
I've got to get back home.

92
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,232
At last I can stop thinking,
for once in my life.

93
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,630
Just stop thinking

94
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,872
and fly towards the lights in the dark.

95
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,830
Dark?

96
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,039
Seagulls never fly in the dark.

97
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,519
Get down.

98
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,795
If you were meant to fly in the dark,
you'd have the eyes of an owl.

99
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,235
You'd have charts for brains.

100
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,868
You'd have a falcon's short wings.

101
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,075
A falcon's short wings.

102
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,150
I dive on the wingtips only.

103
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,875
Why didn't I think?

104
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,794
Short wings. Short wings.

105
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,312
Faster than any seagull anywhere. Ever!

106
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,393
I'll teach the others.
I'll show the flock how!

107
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,992
I did it!

108
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,508
It works.

109
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,275
Short wings all controlled. It works!

110
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,434
I must have hit 1 70 in the dive,
and that was just a short dive.

111
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,991
What will I hit if I dive
from 1 0,000 feet?

112
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,114
A quick roll in, fold the wings,
just the tips out in the air,

113
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,033
take her straight down
just like last night,

114
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,670
and we'll see
just how fast a seagull can fly.

115
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,748
One-eighty! One-ninety!

116
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,953
Oh, God! The flock!

117
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,633
Look out!

118
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,799
The elders. The whole flock.

119
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,598
They believe me now.

120
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,599
They finally understand.

121
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,070
Jonathan Livingston Seagull...

122
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,032
...you have been called here

123
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,510
to be judged in the sight of your flock.

124
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,319
Jonathan Gull,
for your reckless flying,

125
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,234
for refusing to join the flock
to which you were born,

126
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,189
for turning your back
upon the traditions of your flock,

127
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,793
assembled here.

128
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,916
I haven't turned my back.

129
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,277
I want to share what I've found
with all of you.

130
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,513
Jonathan Livingston Seagull,
you do not live as we live.

131
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,709
You do not fly as we fly.

132
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,634
You do not believe as we believe.

133
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,837
You will learn that life is the unknown

134
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,911
and the unknowable.

135
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,517
We are put into this world
to survive any way we can,

136
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,910
as long as we can.

137
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,233
I don't believe that.

138
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,712
Jonathan Seagull,
the brotherhood is broken.

139
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,713
Never again will you
see any of your flock.

140
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,829
Never again will you have
the protection of your flock.

141
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,632
You are henceforth and forever outcast!

142
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,713
Outcast.

143
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,270
- Jonathan.
- Why, Jonathan? Why?

144
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,036
No. This is not your sky.

145
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,273
This is my sky! My sky!

146
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,548
Stay out! My sky!

147
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,078
I will fly where a seagull
has never flown before.

148
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,672
I will see every land, every ocean.

149
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,393
I will know all there is
to know of this life.

150
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,954
Who are you?

151
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,230
Hello, Jonathan.

152
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,516
We're from your new flock.

153
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,033
We're your brothers.

154
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,668
We've come to show you a higher place.

155
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,710
I don't have any flock.

156
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,519
I'm old, I'm tired.

157
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,035
I can't fly any higher.

158
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,909
But you can, Jonathan.

159
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,991
For you have learned.

160
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,151
One school is finished,
and it is time for another to begin.

161
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,871
Oh...

162
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,871
...I see.

163
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,273
Am I an outcast here too?

164
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,512
Jonathan, we've come to take you home.

165
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,432
It's time to begin.

166
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,639
I don't know quite where I am.

167
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,236
Have I slept a long time?

168
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,913
Only for a short while.

169
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,514
I'm Maureen, your instructor here.

170
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,432
We're going to learn together.

171
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,919
Maureen.

172
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:17,712
Your name came into my mind
even before you said it.

173
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,632
Welcome home.

174
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,509
Home? I've never been here before.

175
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,877
Maybe not.
Feels like home though, doesn't it?

176
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,119
Everything feels different.

177
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,918
Where is everybody?

178
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,310
Why aren't there more of us here?

179
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,516
The only answer I can see, Jonathan,

180
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,036
is that you were pretty well
a one-in-a-million bird.

181
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,509
Most of us came along ever so slowly.

182
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,719
We went from one world into another
that was almost exactly like it,

183
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,348
forgetting right away
where we'd come from,

184
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,397
not caring where we were headed,

185
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,471
living for the moment.

186
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:57,914
Do you have any idea how many lives
we must have gone through

187
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,709
before we even got the first idea
that there is more to life

188
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:06,431
than eating or fighting
or power in the flock?

189
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,318
Many lives, Jon.

190
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:14,112
And then other lives to learn that
there is such a thing as perfection.

191
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,114
And others again, to finally get
the idea that our purpose for living

192
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,714
is to find that perfection

193
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,359
and show it forth.

194
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,037
But you, Jonathan,
learned so much at one time

195
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,636
that you didn't have to go
through 1 00 lives to reach this one.

196
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:35,635
My life back there,
I don't remember very well.

197
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,315
Everything's blurred, I...

198
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,835
All those years.

199
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,639
Cast out? Alone?

200
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:49,112
Yes. But it was a fine life.

201
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,919
Didn't you say you know me
from somewhere?

202
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,038
I believe there were
many somewheres.

203
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,638
I know what it is to speak,
to feel and never to be heard.

204
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:05,430
Can I really learn
to fly without limits?

205
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,910
Maybe you'll find something
that will mean even more to you

206
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,036
than flying without limits.

207
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,113
To learn what perfection really is.

208
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,999
Let's try some real flying now.

209
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,478
You're adjusting very well
to your new body, and to the air here.

210
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,313
It's almost time for you
to meet the elders here.

211
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,517
I don't want to see
an elder as long as I...

212
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,511
Well...

213
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,830
Are you afraid to say ''live''?

214
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,231
Have you ever felt more alive? Happier?

215
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,109
No, that's...
that's just the point. I...

216
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,273
I don't want any elder
telling me what I can't do.

217
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,478
This is your new flock, Jonathan.

218
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,830
What was that?

219
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,274
Maureen?

220
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,071
Look up there.

221
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,913
Oh, I was afraid he'd gone away.

222
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,197
Jonathan, that's Chiang.

223
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,078
Not bad, for a feeble old elder.

224
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:56,600
Maureen, I never saw
anyone fly like that.

225
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,711
Good evening, Maureen.

226
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,199
Jonathan.

227
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,713
Good evening, Chiang.

228
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,233
Hello, sir.

229
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,152
It's an honour to meet you.

230
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,914
The honour is mine, Jonathan Seagull.

231
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,513
Maureen.

232
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,113
He learns well?

233
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,635
A little impatient is all.

234
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,358
He knows everything I know.

235
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,714
And more now.

236
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,714
Maureen, how can you say that?
I have so much to learn.

237
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,996
You know so much more than I.

238
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,310
Jonathan, you know it now.

239
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,836
You still need to practise
smoothness and patience,

240
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,753
but you know the flying very well.

241
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,832
I still have questions.

242
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,150
Ask whatever you want.

243
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,039
I... Well...

244
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,557
Chiang, this world
isn't heaven at all, is it?

245
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,756
Where we are now.

246
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,638
It isn't heaven at all.

247
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,513
Who said it was?

248
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,511
Heaven isn't a place.

249
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,434
Heaven's perfection.
Wouldn't you think?

250
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:23,912
And we don't go there,
as much as we express it.

251
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,911
Does that sound true to you?

252
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,638
Yes.

253
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,995
I suppose.

254
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,638
You're a very fast flyer.

255
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,872
Well, I... I enjoy travelling quickly,

256
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,511
but I don't like limits.

257
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:45,515
I want to fly faster than I can now
and higher and learn more.

258
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,116
I can fly 276 miles per hour now.

259
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:54,308
Level. That's pretty fast,
but it's not fast enough.

260
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:59,270
Don't ask me why,
but it just isn't fast enough.

261
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,510
What is fast enough, Jonathan?

262
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:06,309
You who are impatient to be perfect.

263
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,074
What is perfect speed?

264
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,111
Well...

265
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,511
...perfect speed.

266
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,035
A thousand miles per hour?

267
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,838
That's a limit.

268
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,230
A million miles an hour?

269
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,231
That's a limit.

270
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,516
Speed of light?

271
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,238
That's a limit too.

272
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,960
They're all limits.

273
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:35,035
Perfect speed, my son,
isn't moving fast at all.

274
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,397
Perfect speed is being there.

275
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,671
So...

276
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,829
Maureen, did you see that?

277
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,036
He says we can all learn that,

278
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,031
whenever we want to learn it.

279
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,792
The next life maybe.

280
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,030
It is not so difficult, Jonathan,

281
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,633
once we understand.

282
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,631
I want to understand, now.

283
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,711
What does it feel like?

284
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,474
How far can you go?

285
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,518
To any place, to any time

286
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,989
that you wish to go.

287
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,711
I've gone everywhere
and every-when I can think of.

288
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,316
After a while, one begins to think

289
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,029
that space and time are not quite real.

290
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,317
Can you teach me to fly like that?

291
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,835
Of course. If you want to learn.

292
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,117
Yes, I want. When can we start?
I'll do anything.

293
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,919
Maureen, did you see...?
I've got to learn.

294
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,832
How do you do it?
I mean, how...?

295
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,117
First, you let your teacher
get a word in edgewise.

296
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,714
I'm sorry, Chiang.

297
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,519
It's just that all my life...

298
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:47,513
I can't explain it.
...I've had this...

299
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,035
This need to know.

300
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:55,513
To fly as fast as thought,
to anywhere that is now,

301
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,514
or ever has been or ever will be,

302
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:05,118
you begin by knowing
that you've already arrived.

303
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,669
I beg your pardon?

304
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,477
I am already there,
on that highest peak.

305
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,272
I am not limited by any body.

306
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,914
I am not limited by space.

307
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,594
I am not limited by time.

308
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:32,468
I am a perfect expression
of freedom, here and now.

309
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,314
All right, here I go.

310
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,996
I am going right... now!

311
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,877
Now!

312
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,991
Now?

313
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,872
Jonathan?

314
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,513
Can I bring you anything?

315
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,113
No.

316
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,918
Nothing.

317
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,718
I have to do this.

318
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,873
I don't care how long
I have to stand here, I will do it.

319
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,836
Would you like to take a break?

320
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,831
Good evening, sir, I...

321
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,514
I'm concentrating as hard as I can.

322
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,114
I just can't get it.

323
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:46,034
Jon, you don't need faith.

324
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,475
You don't need faith to fly.

325
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:52,995
You need to understand flying,
don't you?

326
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:58,629
To learn certain facts
about things you cannot see.

327
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,472
This is just the same.

328
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:04,519
I am a perfect expression
of freedom and flight.

329
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,830
Why am I thinking that way?

330
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,911
This isn't some ritual.

331
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,638
Real is real.

332
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,872
I really am a perfect idea.

333
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:18,910
It works. It really works.

334
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,514
Well, of course it works, Jonathan.

335
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,433
It always works
when you know what you're doing.

336
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,309
Now, about your control...

337
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:31,717
Well, it's different anyway.

338
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:34,235
We're trapped in here.

339
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,913
There's no way out of here.

340
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,753
Jonathan, there's a way out.

341
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,033
Oh... yes.

342
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,510
But why did I come here at all?

343
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,511
Like attracts like.

344
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:52,708
Wherever your thought is,
that is where your body is going to be,

345
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,233
sooner or later.

346
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,516
You're just learning to do it sooner.

347
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:00,514
Did you want to be walled away,
to think this over?

348
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,113
Here you are.

349
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,111
Try it again.

350
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:07,511
And hold your thought
on something you've always loved.

351
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,276
I know things I love, but I'm not sure.

352
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,677
Do it. I'm with you.

353
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,238
I have always liked stars.

354
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,913
It is a fine view.

355
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,310
And a good place to be alone.

356
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,517
But so much of love is giving,
don't you think?

357
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:32,117
Sharing the very best you know
with someone who's trying to learn.

358
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:36,239
Try it again,
and this time, think giving.

359
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,516
No special names or place.

360
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:42,275
Just think love
and see where you turn up.

361
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,033
Ready?

362
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,031
Any time.

363
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,838
What's this?

364
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,513
What's happening?

365
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:53,911
My old flock. I don't love them.

366
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,036
Don't you, Jonathan?

367
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:00,512
Well, I always did want to give them
what I'd learned about flying,

368
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:03,114
if that's what you mean by love,

369
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,713
but I never found the way.

370
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,519
When the time is right
for you to give to them,

371
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,035
nothing can keep it from happening.

372
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,873
When it's wrong,
nothing can make it be.

373
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,873
I can't see how that can ever happen.

374
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,712
Don't worry about it.

375
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,314
Try it, once more now.

376
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:25,918
Think love and being in the place
that's right for you to be now.

377
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,708
Hello, Maureen.

378
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,871
Hello, Jonathan.

379
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,992
The time's come for me to leave you.

380
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,716
There are others I must help.

381
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,711
And there is more for me to learn.

382
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:47,236
You can't leave now. l've only begun.

383
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,915
Jonathan Seagull,
someday you will know

384
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,719
how long ago your flight began

385
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:57,793
and how great a journey
you have travelled.

386
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:01,111
Now you are ready
to begin the most difficult

387
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,511
and the most powerful journey of all.

388
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:10,630
You are ready to fly up and know
the meaning of kindness and love.

389
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,639
Jonathan, you were born
to be a teacher,

390
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:20,113
to give the truth to anyone
struggling to break out of his limits.

391
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:23,909
It is important to give
what you have found, as a gift,

392
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,640
to whomever will accept it.

393
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:31,396
Chiang, I know I'll see you again.

394
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,869
Of course you will, and, Jonathan,

395
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,788
keep working on love.

396
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:23,114
What's the matter?

397
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:26,317
How much more I would've known,
if someone like Chiang

398
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,119
had come along the day
I was an outcast.

399
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:32,113
What a different life I would have had.

400
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:35,909
What a different life
the flock back there would've had.

401
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,834
Maureen, I have to go back.

402
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,718
We're always parting.

403
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:44,314
We're always saying goodbye.

404
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,710
I know you don't want me to go.

405
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:50,236
I know my old flock
doesn't care what flying is.

406
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,231
They don't care about learning.

407
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,109
They don't care about looking
beyond what they see with their eyes,

408
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:01,673
but, Maureen, there's got to be
somebody in that time who cares.

409
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:05,797
Jonathan, go with my love.

410
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,879
Maureen, goodbye for now.

411
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:25,070
I love who you are, Jonathan.

412
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,834
Fletcher Lynd Seagull,

413
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,356
you were born to us,
but you are not part of us.

414
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,316
You cry against the flock

415
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,436
and against the law.

416
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,751
You ask questions,
answered 1 ,000 years ago.

417
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,114
You do not wish
the protection of the flock.

418
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,872
And you shall not have it.

419
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:39,077
You are henceforth and forever...

420
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,592
...outcast!

421
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,911
I don't want your protection.

422
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,310
You're gonna wish you never...

423
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,630
All your ''henceforth and forever.''

424
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,155
It's not gonna be me
who needs protection.

425
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,197
It's not gonna be me!

426
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,591
I don't care what they say.

427
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:59,240
There's one hell of a lot more to flying

428
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,710
than just flapping around from A to B.

429
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,996
A mosquito can do that.

430
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:10,114
One little barrel roll around the elder
to show him what's possible,

431
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:12,271
and I'm outcast.

432
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,277
Can't they see?

433
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,919
Can't they...
they think of the glory it'll be

434
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:24,231
when we really find out how to fly?

435
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,311
Damn the flock.

436
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,710
I'll be outlaw all right.

437
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,713
Outlaw like they never saw before.

438
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,836
I'll make them so sorry.

439
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,871
Don't hurt them, Fletcher Seagull.

440
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,115
Who are you?

441
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,829
In casting you out, the other gulls
have only hurt themselves,

442
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,835
and one day they will know this,
and one day they will see what you see.

443
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,912
Forgive them and help them understand.

444
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,911
I don't understand.

445
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,311
Fletcher Lynd Seagull,
do you want to learn to fly?

446
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:11,712
Do you want to fly so much that you
will forgive the flock? And learn?

447
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,348
And go back to them one day
and help them know?

448
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,636
I do!

449
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,395
Then, Fletcher, let's begin
with level flight.

450
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,316
We're all outcasts.

451
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:26,913
We're all friends.

452
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,469
We're learning to fly
just for the fun of it.

453
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,598
Take your time.

454
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,835
Your whole body
from wingtip to wingtip

455
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,719
is nothing more
than your thought itself,

456
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,711
in a form you can see.

457
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,711
Break the chains of your thought,

458
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,474
and you break the chains
of your body too.

459
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,277
That's fine, Fletcher. Judy Lee.

460
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:03,673
Fly it nice and loose
until you get used to formation flying.

461
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,911
We'll just go on practicing,

462
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,992
and you can slide in closer
whenever you feel like it.

463
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:16,316
Fletcher, it's time to go.

464
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,118
Time to go where, Jonathan?

465
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,713
Back to the flock.

466
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,233
We have a gift to give.

467
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:22,833
But we're not ready.

468
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,912
We're not welcome.
Jonathan, we're outcast.

469
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:29,277
We can't force ourselves
where we're not welcome, can we?

470
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,112
And it's the law of the flock!

471
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,033
We're free to go where we wish
and to be what we are.

472
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,236
Why should we bother with the flock?

473
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:39,437
Seagulls are the laziest,
dirtiest, most vicious...

474
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:43,115
Suspicious, clumsiest.
A seagull hardly knows how to walk.

475
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:47,239
But don't you see, Fletcher?
A seagull wasn't made to walk.

476
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,437
He was made to fly,
and when he learns to fly,

477
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:55,116
he's the purest, loveliest,
most graceful creature alive.

478
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,909
True for you, true for me,
true for all the flock.

479
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:04,677
We can soar free across the sky,
but how often we don't want to.

480
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,511
That's the gift we can give,

481
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:13,673
to help those who want to learn
find what they love to do.

482
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:36,392
It is the law of the flock
that an outcast never returns.

483
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:41,111
Anyone who follows them,
anyone who listens to them,

484
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:46,035
anyone who turns his back on the flock
will be outcast too!

485
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,320
I only wish to share what I've learned.

486
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:52,195
The very simple fact
that it is right for a gull to fly

487
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:55,033
because freedom
is the very nature of his being.

488
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:58,351
Whatever stands against that freedom
must be set aside.

489
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:01,432
We don't need ritual
and superstitions to live.

490
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,512
The law of the flock decides!

491
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:07,638
Do you speak of law?
Is it the law which decrees

492
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:11,076
we must fight among ourselves
just to feed on garbage?

493
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:12,719
It can't be!

494
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:15,917
The only true law
is that which sets us free.

495
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,433
There can be no other.

496
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:21,111
How can you expect us
to fly as you fly?

497
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:24,477
You are special and gifted and divine,

498
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,631
above other birds.

499
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,917
Look at Fletcher,
Charles-Roland, Judy Lee.

500
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,913
Are they also special
and gifted and divine?

501
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:34,274
No more than you are.

502
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,032
No more than I am.

503
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:39,112
The only difference, the very only one,

504
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:42,511
is that they have begun to understand
what they really are

505
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,477
and have begun to practise it.

506
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,029
What if we could fly like that?

507
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,270
They're outcasts. Ignore them.

508
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,000
Don't listen to him. Ignore him!

509
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,229
Ignore them.

510
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,516
Ignore them all. They're outcasts.

511
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:59,434
Anyone who looks upon an outcast
breaks the law of the flock!

512
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,352
Ignore them.

513
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,078
Ignore him!

514
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:22,272
Each of us finds and follows
what we most love to do,

515
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:24,032
no matter what others think.

516
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:28,113
And this brings us automatically
to discover more of who we really are.

517
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:31,317
There's a law there,
a principle like aerodynamics,

518
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,232
that simply does not fail.

519
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,515
You can count on it.

520
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,910
- Help me.
- Hello, Kirk Maynard.

521
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:41,596
I want to fly more than anything
in the world. Please.

522
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,478
We can start learning right now.

523
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,916
You don't understand.

524
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,832
My wing.

525
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,638
I can't move my wing.

526
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:52,109
You have the freedom to be yourself,

527
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:55,829
your true self, here and now,
and nothing can stand in your way.

528
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,195
Are you saying I can fly?

529
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:01,113
Kirk Maynard can't fly.
He was born crippled.

530
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:05,273
- He's never been off the ground.
- You're free, Kirk Maynard.

531
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,792
Fly.

532
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,875
Fly.

533
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,998
I can fly.

534
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,398
I can fly!

535
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,434
Listen, I can fly.

536
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,875
I can fly!

537
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,314
This Fletcher says he'll
come right down here

538
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,630
in front of us at 200 miles an hour.

539
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:05,518
Just to prove it.

540
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:09,309
If he can learn it, I can learn it.

541
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:13,519
- I'll believe it when he shows us how.
- I'm sorry, I just don't believe it.

542
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:17,878
A normal seagull like you and me is
not meant to fly at 200 miles an hour.

543
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,919
Somewhere up there Fletcher's flying.

544
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,389
I've known him since he was your age.

545
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,709
I'm afraid, Mother.
I want to go with you.

546
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,872
Stay here. I want you safe.

547
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,515
Here we go. They won't believe it
till they see it with their eyes,

548
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:40,194
till we prove it especially for them.

549
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,476
Listen, we should be able to hear him.

550
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,591
Quiet, I think I hear him.

551
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,272
I'm ready.

552
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,631
- Here he comes!
- Do you believe now?

553
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:13,679
- I can't.
- Mother. Mother! Where are you?

554
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:21,632
Look at that baby bird! He's in
Fletcher's way! He'll get killed!

555
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,797
I had to.

556
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,797
I would have hit him.

557
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,636
- But why?
- The trick, Fletcher,

558
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:58,839
is that we're trying to overcome
our limitations in order, patiently.

559
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,709
We don't go flying through rock
until a little later in the programme.

560
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:03,869
Jonathan!

561
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,235
Also known as the Son of the Great Gull?

562
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,436
What are you doing here? The...

563
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,272
The cliff.

564
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:14,995
There was a...
a baby gull gliding down.

565
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,272
Haven't I...?

566
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:20,230
Didn't I... die?

567
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:23,233
Oh, Fletcher, come on, think.

568
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:27,279
If you're talking to me now,
then obviously you didn't die, did you?

569
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:33,271
You merely changed your level
of thinking... rather abruptly.

570
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:37,709
It's your choice now. You can stay here
and learn on this level,

571
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:41,156
which is quite a bit higher
than the one you left, by the way,

572
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:43,914
or you can go back
and keep working in the flock.

573
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:47,629
The elders were hoping
for some kind of disaster,

574
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:51,429
but they're startled
that you would oblige them so well.

575
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,830
I want to go back to the flock.

576
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,629
Of course! There's a new group...

577
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,836
I haven't even begun.

578
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,230
You're sure you wouldn't rather stay?

579
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,719
Let's get going.

580
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,638
All right, Fletcher.
Remember what we were saying

581
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:11,270
about our body being nothing
more than thought itself?

582
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,228
Fletcher.

583
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,239
Fletcher?

584
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,592
It's true.

585
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:40,950
Jon, I'm beginning to see.

586
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,519
- He's alive!
- He touched him with a feather.

587
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:48,638
- Brought him to life!
- He is the Son of the Great Gull.

588
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:52,156
It's a trick! Don't listen to him!

589
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,718
He's a devil!

590
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,711
He's the devil!

591
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:00,440
He is the devil. He is the devil!

592
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,315
I tell you he is the devil!

593
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:12,157
He can destroy us all!

594
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:16,353
He can destroy the flock!

595
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,397
Kill him!

596
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,672
Kill him!

597
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:39,191
Kill him!

598
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:54,838
Kill him!

599
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,032
Kill him!

600
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,836
Would you feel better if we left?

601
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,710
They wanted to kill us!

602
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,279
How did we get away?

603
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,908
Like everything else,
Fletcher, practice.

604
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:26,513
I don't understand.

605
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:29,877
The flock was gonna kill us.
Our own flock!

606
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:35,437
Why? Remember what you said
about loving the flock enough

607
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,910
to return to them and help them live?
They wanted us dead.

608
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:41,310
They're a mob. They're killers.

609
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:43,072
How can you love them?

610
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:46,232
You don't love hatred and evil,
of course.

611
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:49,472
You have to practise and see the good
in every one of them

612
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:53,110
and help them see it in themselves.
That's what we mean by love.

613
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:56,829
It's fun...
when you get the idea of it.

614
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,560
I remember a fierce young bird,
for instance.

615
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,597
Fletcher Lynd Seagull, his name.

616
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:05,150
Just been made outcast,
ready to fight the flock to the death,

617
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:09,279
getting a start on building his own
bitter hell out on the far cliffs.

618
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:12,876
And here he is today,
building his own heaven instead

619
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,679
and leading the whole flock
in that direction.

620
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,832
Me? Leading?

621
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,036
You're the instructor here.

622
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,997
You can't leave us.

623
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:26,550
Don't you think there might be
other flocks, other Fletchers

624
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:29,473
that need an instructor now
more than this one?

625
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:32,632
But me, Jon?
I'm just a plain seagull, and you're...

626
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,472
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I know.

627
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:36,915
The only Son of the Great Gull,
I suppose.

628
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:39,514
Fletcher, you don't need me anymore.

629
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:42,911
All the younger ones in the flock
and some of the others too

630
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:44,718
are ready to follow you now.

631
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:49,510
All you need is to keep finding
the real, unlimited Fletcher Seagull.

632
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:51,238
He's your instructor.

633
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:54,836
And don't let them spread
silly rumours about me

634
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,037
or try to make me some
sort of a god, will you, Fletcher?

635
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,839
I'm a seagull. I like to fly, maybe.

636
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,797
Jonathan.

637
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:07,351
We both have learned what we were meant
to learn in our time together, Fletcher.

638
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:13,469
That the way to find perfection
and love is within us.

639
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,311
Look with your understanding.

640
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,710
Find out what you already know.

641
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,518
Use it, Fletcher.

642
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:23,638
Teach it, show it forth.

643
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:26,268
And you'll know the way to fly.
