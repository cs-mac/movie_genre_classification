1
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:07,964
Here.

2
00:00:07,988 --> 00:00:11,847
Let's hug Eun Sung

3
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:16,768
and hug Mom too! I'll hug you both!

4
00:00:19,015 --> 00:00:19,606
Eun Sung,

5
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:20,918
you're not hungry?

6
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:22,261
I'm hungry.

7
00:00:22,262 --> 00:00:24,851
- Shall we go eat? - Yes! Let's!

8
00:00:32,972 --> 00:00:36,091
There wasn't anything up?

9
00:00:36,092 --> 00:00:38,041
What would happen?

10
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:40,562
Never mind. I don't mean anything by it.

11
00:00:47,762 --> 00:00:51,542
Did you think I would be emotionally moved
if you wrote this statement of account?

12
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:55,772
Don't do that ever again.

13
00:00:57,522 --> 00:01:00,012
Aren't you ashamed to face Eun Sung?

14
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:06,981
Everything's been taken care of now.
Father just went overboard.

15
00:01:06,982 --> 00:01:08,511
Did it really get all resolved?

16
00:01:08,512 --> 00:01:11,992
What's not to be fixed?
There's nothing I did wrong.

17
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:17,761
Kang Hye Soo, from now on, don't
decide anything by yourself.

18
00:01:17,762 --> 00:01:20,391
I'm undoubtedly your husband
and Eun Sung's dad.

19
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:25,492
Our divorce hasn't been processed. Even if the deliberation period has passed, you know if we don't go to
court, it becomes invalid, right? (<i>Korean court of law gives the couple appointed time to mull things over</i>)

20
00:01:28,242 --> 00:01:34,792
Eun Sung, instead of calling
me Ahjussi, call me Dad.

21
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,851
Look here.

22
00:01:38,852 --> 00:01:42,851
What do you mean "look here"? I
told you to call me Ji Hoon.

23
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:49,911
Well. Rather than... Uh, Honey or Darling
since it's too corny, just call me Oppa.

24
00:01:49,912 --> 00:01:54,441
From now on, please don't do anything
foolish. Just do only what I tell you to.

25
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:58,811
First. Let's combine our stuff.
Let's find a house first.

26
00:01:58,812 --> 00:01:59,562
Look here.

27
00:01:59,563 --> 00:02:05,282
Eun Sung, could you call me Dad?

28
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:10,402
Dad.

29
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,101
Eun Sung, say it again.

30
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,608
Dad.

31
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:19,432
Aigoo. Aigoo my daughter.

32
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:25,771
Who did you say I was?

33
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:27,852
Dad.

34
00:02:29,392 --> 00:02:35,891
There can't be a single word from the
board meeting leaked to the press.

35
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:39,881
Let's first silence the board members.

36
00:02:39,882 --> 00:02:45,681
Organ selling or whatever. Not a
single word of that can be leaked out.

37
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:47,221
Understood, chairman.

38
00:02:47,222 --> 00:02:52,141
Contact Attorney Oh and ask him
to come up with some solutions.

39
00:02:52,142 --> 00:02:53,992
Yes, Chairman.

40
00:03:03,592 --> 00:03:05,181
Managing Director Han Ji
Hoon resigned I heard?

41
00:03:05,182 --> 00:03:09,951
It seemed he made some big mess. They say
he resigned before anyone took note.

42
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:15,112
- What kind of news is this immediately after promotion? - It
seems the elder son will now take charge of the spotlight.

43
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:29,731
Oh yeah Reporter Hong. You didn't forget
the appointment we made last time did you?

44
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:32,382
We need to have a meal together.

45
00:03:33,682 --> 00:03:35,651
<i>The Promise</i>

46
00:03:35,652 --> 00:03:40,401
Here here here. You've all worked hard. Let's head
to <i>Hongdae</i> (<i>neighborhood in Seoul</i>) for drinks.

47
00:03:40,402 --> 00:03:42,041
You've all done good work.

48
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:43,631
Hello.

49
00:03:43,632 --> 00:03:45,762
Will you see me for a bit?

50
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:53,301
Thank you for all this time.

51
00:03:53,302 --> 00:03:57,242
I'm going to be working until the end of the
month. Then I'm won't be coming here anymore.

52
00:03:58,382 --> 00:03:59,521
What did he say?

53
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:01,711
He said he's quitting.

54
00:04:01,712 --> 00:04:06,141
Thanks to you, I believe our Promise
Restaurant was able to grow this much.

55
00:04:06,142 --> 00:04:10,171
If there was any hard feelings you had towards
me, please be understanding and let them go.

56
00:04:10,172 --> 00:04:13,481
I also know I did a lot
of unsightly things, too.

57
00:04:13,482 --> 00:04:16,031
Uh... what are you saying..
All of a sudden...

58
00:04:16,032 --> 00:04:19,451
Oh. You're here? Regional
Headquarter Manager?

59
00:04:19,452 --> 00:04:23,431
Well I'll be closing up and leaving. If there are any
complaints that you'd like to address, please let me know.

60
00:04:23,432 --> 00:04:25,782
I'll do my best to address them.

61
00:04:38,332 --> 00:04:42,748
Hey. What happened? Tell all.

62
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:47,651
What's there to tell. Since I did wrong,
quitting is certainly the right thing to do.

63
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:52,121
What do you mean "sin"? Your mother
didn't even get surgery from Hye Soo.

64
00:04:52,122 --> 00:04:54,701
Isn't it too much quitting over that?

65
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:58,641
You should've kept hanging
on and pressing hard.

66
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:01,191
It's ok. I'm actually
feeling quite relieved.

67
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:07,101
Relieved, you punk? W-w-what are we going to
do now? What're you going to be living off of?

68
00:05:07,102 --> 00:05:10,021
I found a new place of
employment, so don't worry.

69
00:05:10,022 --> 00:05:11,531
Already?

70
00:05:11,532 --> 00:05:16,531
Hey Ho Joon. I'm going to marry Hye Soo.

71
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:18,242
-What - I mean

72
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:23,292
The marriage has already been done. I'm going
to move in with her and live together.

73
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:27,831
Look. Has your father
given you his permission?

74
00:05:27,832 --> 00:05:32,131
Am I some kind of minor? I've already passed the
age to gain parental approval for marriage.

75
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:35,738
I'm deciding my own marriage. What's
that have to do with my father?

76
00:05:35,762 --> 00:05:39,461
You... did you by chance, get kicked out?

77
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:41,851
You you punk. Why are
you speaking like that?

78
00:05:41,852 --> 00:05:45,562
Hey. You! you... what am I going to do now?

79
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:48,592
I'm about to get the can...

80
00:05:53,532 --> 00:05:55,792
Kang Hye Soo, are you ok?

81
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:04,561
Yeah. I'm ok. Don't worry.

82
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:06,921
If it's difficult. Let me know.

83
00:06:06,922 --> 00:06:08,722
Yeah.

84
00:06:42,472 --> 00:06:44,181
- Hello - Hello

85
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:46,202
Could you have a seat there for one moment?

86
00:06:48,222 --> 00:06:53,262
I think we have to... temporarily
suspend the radiation treatments.

87
00:06:54,002 --> 00:06:58,461
Not to mention your stamina, your
immunity has decreased tremendously.

88
00:06:58,462 --> 00:07:03,162
Since there are too many side effects. I
think there'd be more to loose than gain.

89
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:07,622
If your body's not strong enough, it's
not possible to undergo treatment.

90
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:11,972
What happens if we stop treatment?

91
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:18,791
You said there's no other way
besides radiation therapy.

92
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:21,582
Next year, our child
will be entering school.

93
00:07:26,232 --> 00:07:29,282
Will I be able to live until then?

94
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:37,722
Maybe it's because you're young. It's true that the
progression is most faster than I had thought.

95
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:43,672
But still don't loose hope,
and have a strong heart.

96
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:03,721
Has Miss Kang Hye Soo not arrived yet?

97
00:08:03,722 --> 00:08:07,791
Miss Kang Hye Soo's treatments
have been suspended.

98
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:11,881
Yes? What are you talking about?

99
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:13,741
I'll start again...

100
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:15,231
- Hello - Hello, yes.

101
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:18,802
- Mr. Lee Sang Soo?
- Yes - Let's go inside.

102
00:08:21,912 --> 00:08:24,721
Ah excuse me, doc.

103
00:08:24,722 --> 00:08:29,532
What does it mean that my wife's
treatments have been stopped?

104
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:33,432
Has it become much worse?

105
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:40,352
Yes, it's because the patient's condition has worsened
considerably. The speed of progression is just so fast.

106
00:08:42,132 --> 00:08:47,671
Is there no other way? We should still
treat it. You said it was getting worse.

107
00:08:47,672 --> 00:08:49,711
Does it make sense that we sit
here twiddling our thumbs?

108
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:55,291
As of now there's no other way really.
There' s nothing i can guarantee.

109
00:08:55,292 --> 00:09:00,111
Look here. How is that so. Anyone
can say that. Are you a doctor?!

110
00:09:00,112 --> 00:09:04,401
You have to get her well no matter what. I'm a
slipshod husband, but you're also a slipshod doc too.

111
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:07,251
You have to tell her that she'll live no
matter what. That way she'll get better.

112
00:09:07,252 --> 00:09:09,682
Please calm down.

113
00:09:16,642 --> 00:09:18,892
I'm begging you doctor,

114
00:09:20,002 --> 00:09:21,982
save her.

115
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:26,282
We have to save our Hye Soo.

116
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:51,182
I told you not to come to the hospital by
yourself. Why did you break your promise, huh?

117
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:58,162
You worked hard. Aren't you hungry?

118
00:09:59,742 --> 00:10:04,481
Yeah I'm really hungry. Buy
me something delicious.

119
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:08,312
What would you like to eat? Tell me.
I'll buy you everything.

120
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:18,901
I want to eat chicken, pasta too, and..

121
00:10:18,902 --> 00:10:21,752
<i>Seolleongtang</i> (beef stock stew) as well.

122
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:27,112
I also want to eat Korean table d'hote. The ones
with <i>banchan</i> (side dishes) that are this big!

123
00:10:38,002 --> 00:10:40,421
You're not going to eat?

124
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:41,651
I will eat.

125
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:43,952
If you're not going to eat,
I'm going to eat it all.

126
00:10:52,022 --> 00:10:54,032
Let's change hospitals.

127
00:10:55,592 --> 00:10:57,031
Excuse me?

128
00:10:57,032 --> 00:11:01,581
That lady just had a bad temper.
She seems like she has no skill.

129
00:11:01,582 --> 00:11:05,352
I'm looking for another place, so
let's change for the time being.

130
00:11:08,912 --> 00:11:14,421
I just want to go to the
place I usually went.

131
00:11:14,422 --> 00:11:16,291
The doctor is skilled.

132
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:20,302
What do you mean skill?
She's totally a quack.

133
00:11:21,692 --> 00:11:24,522
She says that I'm progressively
getting better. Don't worry.

134
00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:31,422
I'm serious. Can't you tell
by the way I'm eating?

135
00:11:41,522 --> 00:11:44,091
Here. Drink some water.

136
00:11:44,092 --> 00:11:45,882
Okay.

137
00:11:53,322 --> 00:11:55,862
Do you have somewhere you
want to go after we eat?

138
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:00,171
You're not going to work?

139
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:03,521
What do you mean work? I'm a golden
spoon (meaning he's wealthy).

140
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:07,772
I don't have to work.

141
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:20,292
Let's go see some houses later.

142
00:12:21,922 --> 00:12:24,851
- House?-Did you not understand
what Jung Hoon was saying?

143
00:12:24,852 --> 00:12:29,841
Other people will curse at you. Does it make sense
for a married woman to live at a friend's house?

144
00:12:29,842 --> 00:12:32,121
I have my eye on a house we can live in.

145
00:12:32,122 --> 00:12:36,092
Don't worry. I will go in
when they allow me to.

146
00:12:37,712 --> 00:12:39,732
When should we have the wedding ceremony?

147
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:44,402
Do we have to do that first?

148
00:12:46,322 --> 00:12:48,971
The order is all messed up.

149
00:12:48,972 --> 00:12:51,372
So what if it's messed up?

150
00:12:52,462 --> 00:12:56,021
Kang Hye Soo, will you marry me?

151
00:13:03,822 --> 00:13:05,471
Is this a plee for help?

152
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:07,871
Yes. A plee for help.

153
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:10,571
Why? You don't like it?

154
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:13,351
Of course I don't like it.

155
00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:15,551
Is this the first time doing a proposal?

156
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:17,231
I've received one before.

157
00:13:17,232 --> 00:13:20,491
What kind of proposal is this?

158
00:13:20,492 --> 00:13:23,362
I would still be indecisive
even if you did a proper one.

159
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:29,161
There are proposals where
they hang balloons

160
00:13:29,162 --> 00:13:31,791
pop confetti, fire laser
beams, and scream "I LOVE YOU

161
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:36,572
Hye Soo!" and they sing you songs.
Isn't that what a proposal is?

162
00:13:39,012 --> 00:13:41,372
What do you mean? It's so childish.

163
00:13:43,182 --> 00:13:47,301
I'm not saying I would
receive something like that.

164
00:13:47,302 --> 00:13:51,621
I'm just full of energy that's why.

165
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:55,252
I'm not saying I'll get hit by lightning
just to get something big out of it.

166
00:13:57,432 --> 00:13:59,992
So, you don't like it?

167
00:14:01,902 --> 00:14:04,341
I'll have to think about it.

168
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:06,862
Getting married isn't a joke.

169
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:15,071
You're very old fashioned. Do you
have to receive something so obvious?

170
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:18,432
Forget it! Act like the proposal
and everything else didn't happen.

171
00:14:20,572 --> 00:14:22,522
I don't like it either.

172
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:29,122
This is delicious. Right?

173
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:33,522
Eat more.

174
00:14:37,852 --> 00:14:39,561
Eat this too.

175
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:41,992
I'm eating.

176
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:46,272
This place is delicious right?

177
00:14:53,582 --> 00:14:55,872
You said you eat well.

178
00:15:07,142 --> 00:15:08,692
Here.

179
00:15:12,372 --> 00:15:14,252
Hurry up and eat.

180
00:15:20,122 --> 00:15:23,781
Madam. A guest is here for you.

181
00:15:23,782 --> 00:15:26,192
Hello Madam.

182
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:41,091
I heard the surgery was a success.
Congratulations.

183
00:15:41,092 --> 00:15:45,682
Get out.

184
00:15:49,242 --> 00:15:53,682
This is matter regarding Ji Hoon's life.
Make a promise with me.

185
00:15:55,532 --> 00:16:00,651
That kid looks like he will be investigated
by the police if he isn't careful.

186
00:16:00,652 --> 00:16:03,191
What are you saying?

187
00:16:03,192 --> 00:16:05,411
Who exposed it?

188
00:16:05,412 --> 00:16:07,891
That kid exposed it himself.

189
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:09,721
So innocent.

190
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:14,722
Since this originated from you,
act like you know nothing.

191
00:16:15,762 --> 00:16:19,051
If someone asks you,

192
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:22,931
say that Ji Hoon and that girl have
already been dating for a long time.

193
00:16:22,932 --> 00:16:27,341
When you meet Ji Hoon, tell him
to proceed with the divorce.

194
00:16:27,342 --> 00:16:31,221
Divorcing right now will
only raise suspicion.

195
00:16:31,222 --> 00:16:35,611
They said to divorce once
the rumors died down.

196
00:16:35,612 --> 00:16:39,651
According to the lawyer, that
is the only way right now.

197
00:16:39,652 --> 00:16:42,931
Why are you making me say those things?
Say it yourself.

198
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:45,181
That kid is not in his
right mind right now.

199
00:16:45,182 --> 00:16:47,991
He is so caught up with that child's
mother, he can't see anything.

200
00:16:47,992 --> 00:16:51,691
He turned his back on his
father, and left the company.

201
00:16:51,692 --> 00:16:55,262
What did you just say?

202
00:16:56,202 --> 00:16:59,121
Did you not hear anything from him?

203
00:16:59,122 --> 00:17:02,931
That wench is a total player.

204
00:17:02,932 --> 00:17:05,552
The innocent kid is caught.

205
00:17:07,162 --> 00:17:11,921
There is no reason for parents to be meddling in
the dating life of a child who's all grown up.

206
00:17:11,922 --> 00:17:15,191
He must like her because she is likable.

207
00:17:15,192 --> 00:17:19,301
-What?-Get out. I don't know anymore.

208
00:17:19,302 --> 00:17:24,171
I have no debt to that household,
so don't request anything from me.

209
00:17:24,172 --> 00:17:26,661
How dare you just barge in and
shamelessly ask me for a favor.

210
00:17:26,662 --> 00:17:29,671
Why else do you think I came to you?

211
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:32,391
This is Ji Hoon's matter! He is your son!

212
00:17:32,392 --> 00:17:37,621
How can you say, you don't know when
your son's life is about to be over!?

213
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:40,281
Do you have the right to
say something like that?

214
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:42,011
Are you a father?

215
00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:45,951
Did you think that I wouldn't know

216
00:17:45,952 --> 00:17:47,711
that you are doing all of
this because of your greed?

217
00:17:47,712 --> 00:17:51,892
Stop acting like you're
thinking about your child.

218
00:17:58,122 --> 00:18:02,562
Did you know that the girl was dying?

219
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:05,551
What?

220
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:12,182
You didn't undergo the surgery
already knowing this fact did you?

221
00:18:14,032 --> 00:18:16,242
What do you mean?

222
00:18:17,592 --> 00:18:19,461
Eun Sung!

223
00:18:19,462 --> 00:18:21,301
Dad!

224
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:23,082
It's my dad!

225
00:18:24,632 --> 00:18:26,431
You came.

226
00:18:26,432 --> 00:18:29,241
- Thank you. Come to
Daddy.-Teacher, it's not that.

227
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:33,881
That's not it, Teacher.

228
00:18:33,882 --> 00:18:35,251
Did you miss your Dad?

229
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:37,752
I missed you.

230
00:18:38,822 --> 00:18:42,212
Where are we going?

231
00:18:43,492 --> 00:18:49,181
Let's go Eun Sung.

232
00:18:49,182 --> 00:18:51,502
We have to go to your house.

233
00:18:55,672 --> 00:18:58,782
We're here.

234
00:19:00,712 --> 00:19:05,661
Shall we go in? Come in.

235
00:19:05,662 --> 00:19:07,681
Hurry in Mom.

236
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:09,921
Tada!

237
00:19:09,922 --> 00:19:12,961
Wow, is this our house?

238
00:19:12,962 --> 00:19:16,501
Do you like it? You have your own room.

239
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:19,072
-Where? Where?-Shall I show you?

240
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:22,111
It's over here.

241
00:19:22,112 --> 00:19:24,921
Mom! This is my room!

242
00:19:24,922 --> 00:19:28,082
-Look at this.-Wow!

243
00:19:29,892 --> 00:19:32,571
When did you prepare all of this?

244
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:35,211
I was dying trying to quickly
decorate everything.

245
00:19:35,212 --> 00:19:38,121
For the rest of the stuff, we can
clean it up as we live here.

246
00:19:38,122 --> 00:19:40,921
This was the only house that looked good
enough that was close to Joo Yeon's house.

247
00:19:40,922 --> 00:19:42,811
Live here even if you don't like it.

248
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:46,232
When Eun Sung grows, let's
move to a better place.

249
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,572
Why are you so quick to act?

250
00:19:54,102 --> 00:19:56,611
Because I want to quickly live together.

251
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,062
Is it normal for a couple
to live separately?

252
00:20:00,142 --> 00:20:02,222
Don't you want to see the master bedroom?

253
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:06,582
Why are you like this?

254
00:20:09,322 --> 00:20:13,591
- What do you think about the bedsheets?
You don't like it?

255
00:20:13,592 --> 00:20:14,831
Forget it.

256
00:20:14,832 --> 00:20:18,612
Why? Have a seat or lay down.

257
00:20:20,482 --> 00:20:23,671
Are you upset because I
picked what I wanted?

258
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:26,551
You're right. I am getting upset.

259
00:20:26,552 --> 00:20:30,162
If you're upset, lets lie down.

260
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:40,151
Wait. One second. It tickles.

261
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:42,641
Eun Sung came!

262
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:45,982
Eun Sung, do something about this Ahjusshi.

263
00:20:51,572 --> 00:20:53,621
Why? Do you not like the furniture?

264
00:20:53,622 --> 00:20:57,121
Should I return them all?
Change it to what you like.

265
00:20:57,122 --> 00:21:00,891
My taste will probably be better.
You're old fashioned.

266
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:05,391
I like it. Ahjusshi. Dad.

267
00:21:05,392 --> 00:21:10,582
My daughter is the only
one who knows my heart.

268
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,571
The cats are going to live with us right?

269
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:16,962
-Of course!-Oh yeah!

270
00:21:21,502 --> 00:21:23,951
<i>Manager!</i> Come talk to me.

271
00:21:23,952 --> 00:21:26,222
Yes, sir!

272
00:21:28,602 --> 00:21:32,401
What's going on? Tell me
everything there is to know.

273
00:21:32,402 --> 00:21:33,581
What?

274
00:21:33,582 --> 00:21:38,942
Why is the Executive Director quitting? Why
did he resign right after being promoted?

275
00:21:40,812 --> 00:21:43,741
That rumor about trading
organs was true, wasn't it?

276
00:21:43,742 --> 00:21:46,681
I said it wasn't! It was a
totally groundless rumor!

277
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:49,112
<i>Then why would he resign?</i>

278
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:51,541
Is it because of the sexual
harassment issue with Kang Hye Soo?

279
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:54,221
Ah, geesh! I said it wasn't that!

280
00:21:54,222 --> 00:21:59,682
Why would he sexually harass Hye Soo?
When they can't live without each other?

281
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:03,091
What? He can't live without her?

282
00:22:03,092 --> 00:22:05,761
That's what I said!

283
00:22:05,762 --> 00:22:07,861
He's quitting because he truly likes her.

284
00:22:07,862 --> 00:22:11,821
If he likes her, then why doesn't he just like
her? What does it have to do with quitting?

285
00:22:11,822 --> 00:22:14,721
That's... a... little...

286
00:22:14,722 --> 00:22:16,762
Did he get kicked out by his family?

287
00:22:19,612 --> 00:22:21,971
Seung Joo!

288
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:24,011
Oh! What about Eun Sung?

289
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:26,201
You should've just left. What's up?

290
00:22:26,202 --> 00:22:29,521
No, I was just passing
by and thought of her.

291
00:22:29,522 --> 00:22:32,262
They're fish shaped bean pastries.
Give them to Eun Sung.

292
00:22:33,172 --> 00:22:35,101
Thanks.

293
00:22:35,102 --> 00:22:39,691
Executive Director quit because
he was caught, didn't he?

294
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,751
-Quit?-You didn't know?

295
00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:45,231
He said he's quitting the restaurant.

296
00:22:45,232 --> 00:22:47,982
They said he turned in his
resignation at headquarters.

297
00:22:51,012 --> 00:22:53,182
Are you okay?

298
00:22:54,512 --> 00:22:57,691
I'm fine.

299
00:22:57,692 --> 00:23:00,491
Ah, what would happen?

300
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:05,081
You didn't even go through with the surgery. I
think he just resigned because they found out.

301
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:07,262
My big mouth.

302
00:23:09,132 --> 00:23:14,021
But that guy seems like a decent person.

303
00:23:14,022 --> 00:23:18,111
He must really like you.
I hope things work out.

304
00:23:18,112 --> 00:23:21,721
I came to congratulate you and
wish the two of you well.

305
00:23:21,722 --> 00:23:25,832
Receive all the love you
weren't able to from Hyung.

306
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:29,761
Thanks.

307
00:23:29,762 --> 00:23:33,262
No need for thanks. I'll be going then.

308
00:23:34,272 --> 00:23:36,042
Take care going!

309
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:44,961
How are the rumors?

310
00:23:44,962 --> 00:23:47,321
Do you think they're dying down?

311
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:51,451
For now, it's being stated to the
board of directors that you objected

312
00:23:51,452 --> 00:23:54,741
to their relationship and
that he said it out of anger.

313
00:23:54,742 --> 00:23:57,031
Well done.

314
00:23:57,032 --> 00:24:00,931
The media's quiet? There's
no one trying to contact us?

315
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:03,081
-Actually,...-What?

316
00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:04,301
Is something going on?

317
00:24:04,302 --> 00:24:10,131
There's someone called this Reporter Hong Jin Seok, whose been in contact with the public
relations office saying that he's trying to understand the progression of our company.

318
00:24:10,132 --> 00:24:12,701
What? Who is that?

319
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:18,192
But, it's a reporter who has been friends
for quite a while with Han Jung Hoon.

320
00:24:20,172 --> 00:24:22,472
That punk.

321
00:24:23,332 --> 00:24:27,731
Contact that reporter immediately. I'll
meet him directly and take care of it.

322
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,652
Yes, sir.

323
00:24:37,372 --> 00:24:40,352
-Father, you're home?-<i>Come here!</i>

324
00:24:41,572 --> 00:24:43,821
What? What is it, Father?

325
00:24:43,822 --> 00:24:45,041
I said to come here!

326
00:24:45,042 --> 00:24:49,072
Father, I left something upstairs.

327
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:54,191
You've decided you want to die, didn't you?

328
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,471
What did I say to you?

329
00:24:56,472 --> 00:24:59,771
Did I tell you that if this leaked out,
that I wouldn't leave you alone or not?

330
00:24:59,772 --> 00:25:01,791
What did I do, Father?

331
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,521
<i>Are you asking as if you don't know?</i>

332
00:25:03,522 --> 00:25:07,192
- You're going to fight me until the end?
Is that it?-Honey!

333
00:25:09,032 --> 00:25:10,981
You stay out of this.

334
00:25:10,982 --> 00:25:14,622
What do you have to say after
raising someone like this?

335
00:25:15,872 --> 00:25:19,221
Pack up tomorrow and move to the US office.

336
00:25:19,222 --> 00:25:22,131
I left orders before coming home.

337
00:25:22,132 --> 00:25:24,521
- The American office? - Yeah!

338
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:29,561
If I leave you alone like this, there's
no mistake you'd ruin the company!

339
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:33,061
Go and live quietly, holding your breath.

340
00:25:33,062 --> 00:25:36,281
<i>If you cause trouble there as well,</i>

341
00:25:36,282 --> 00:25:39,251
that day will be the end of our
parent-child relationship.

342
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:43,311
Just know you won't receive
a cent of the inheritance.

343
00:25:43,312 --> 00:25:47,091
It's so unfair, Father!

344
00:25:47,092 --> 00:25:49,931
-Unfair?-Yes, it's unfair!

345
00:25:49,932 --> 00:25:52,232
What do you find so unfair?

346
00:25:53,522 --> 00:25:55,042
<i>Punk.</i>

347
00:25:57,242 --> 00:26:02,871
Mom. Mom, it's really unfair. Seriously.

348
00:26:02,872 --> 00:26:06,291
I really don't want to live, Mom!

349
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:11,462
<i>It's so unfair I'm going to go crazy, Mom!</i>

350
00:26:16,212 --> 00:26:19,212
Please leave. I want to be alone.

351
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,201
Didn't you hear me say that
I want to be left alone?

352
00:26:23,202 --> 00:26:26,461
Yes. Stay alone.

353
00:26:26,462 --> 00:26:29,302
I'll let you stay alone forever.

354
00:26:30,162 --> 00:26:34,381
If Jung Hoon goes, I am
going to follow him.

355
00:26:34,382 --> 00:26:37,381
Stay here alone and live well.

356
00:26:37,382 --> 00:26:39,802
Live for a long, long time.

357
00:26:48,522 --> 00:26:52,981
This woman. Are you saying this
knowing what's going on at work?

358
00:26:52,982 --> 00:26:56,971
That work has nothing to do with me.

359
00:26:56,972 --> 00:27:02,491
Always your work. I've put up hearing
about that work my whole life.

360
00:27:02,492 --> 00:27:05,071
Do you think it's because I'm stupid?

361
00:27:05,072 --> 00:27:09,701
But still, I thought there
might be something at the end.

362
00:27:09,702 --> 00:27:12,301
Since you're getting old,

363
00:27:12,302 --> 00:27:14,811
when you got old, I thought you'd change.

364
00:27:14,812 --> 00:27:18,801
I lived hoping for that one thing.

365
00:27:18,802 --> 00:27:23,262
But, that was all my misunderstanding.

366
00:27:24,682 --> 00:27:27,152
I regret so much having married you.

367
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:32,851
Do you know whose fault it is that
Jung Hoon turned out that way?

368
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:39,452
It's because he's never once seen
you and me cherishing each other.

369
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:42,741
So what if he's incompetent?
Can't you still comfort him?

370
00:27:42,742 --> 00:27:44,451
Isn't that what family is?

371
00:27:44,452 --> 00:27:46,971
Why else do you think I would do all this?

372
00:27:46,972 --> 00:27:52,251
Never mind. It's the same story I've always
heard. I don't want to hear it any longer.

373
00:27:52,252 --> 00:27:55,711
Everyone else is envious
that I'm a chairman's wife.

374
00:27:55,712 --> 00:27:59,042
But who would know that my
life is most like dung?

375
00:28:03,052 --> 00:28:05,281
Live well.

376
00:28:05,282 --> 00:28:07,192
I'm leaving.

377
00:28:08,922 --> 00:28:11,132
After you die,

378
00:28:12,032 --> 00:28:14,192
I'll return then.

379
00:28:29,172 --> 00:28:35,332
Pp

380
00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:27,782
You should get one!

381
00:29:28,522 --> 00:29:31,171
-Mother-in-law!-Oh, welcome.

382
00:29:31,172 --> 00:29:33,371
A customer just left.

383
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:35,101
Why are you here again?

384
00:29:35,102 --> 00:29:37,441
Did you eat lunch?

385
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,731
Huh? Lunch? No.

386
00:29:39,732 --> 00:29:41,851
I'll buy you something delicious.

387
00:29:41,852 --> 00:29:47,512
Ay! Okay, okay. Let's just eat.
Ow, ow, my legs! Ow, ow!

388
00:29:52,612 --> 00:29:54,292
Try some.

389
00:29:56,522 --> 00:30:00,231
Try some of the vegetables.

390
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:04,422
It's been a really long time since
we've eaten together, isn't it?

391
00:30:07,332 --> 00:30:12,922
Now that I'm full, I feel like I can live.
I was aching so much today.

392
00:30:14,722 --> 00:30:16,341
It's difficult, isn't it?

393
00:30:16,342 --> 00:30:18,521
It's okay.

394
00:30:18,522 --> 00:30:21,592
Everyone has to survive somehow.

395
00:30:22,802 --> 00:30:27,071
But, your face keeps looking
more and more gaunt.

396
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:30,182
Why do you keep losing weight?

397
00:30:32,902 --> 00:30:35,691
Actually,

398
00:30:35,692 --> 00:30:39,182
-I have something to tell you.-What is it?

399
00:30:43,672 --> 00:30:45,632
You see,

400
00:30:46,622 --> 00:30:48,661
I...

401
00:30:48,662 --> 00:30:51,091
am a little sick.

402
00:30:51,092 --> 00:30:55,761
Yeah, that's what I said!
I was right, wasn't I?

403
00:30:55,762 --> 00:30:59,792
So what did they say was wrong?
Is it a genetic disease?

404
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,612
No.

405
00:31:06,102 --> 00:31:07,742
If it happens

406
00:31:09,262 --> 00:31:13,222
that I leave suddenly,

407
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:17,472
I wanted to tell you ahead of time.

408
00:31:19,052 --> 00:31:21,212
What are you saying?

409
00:31:40,552 --> 00:31:43,432
They say that I can't live very long.

410
00:31:45,742 --> 00:31:48,222
<i>If I end up leaving,</i>

411
00:31:49,822 --> 00:31:52,822
please take care of my Eun Sung.

412
00:31:55,422 --> 00:31:59,181
But asking you that favor

413
00:31:59,182 --> 00:32:01,202
brings me the most peace.

414
00:32:14,202 --> 00:32:17,801
Aren't I so shameless?

415
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,702
Right, Mother-in-law?

416
00:32:36,942 --> 00:32:42,542
I heard all about it. How did this happen?

417
00:32:50,822 --> 00:32:52,531
Who did you hear it from?

418
00:32:52,532 --> 00:32:56,712
Your father. He came to see me.

419
00:32:59,632 --> 00:33:02,711
As even more time passes
by, I'm in complete awe.

420
00:33:02,712 --> 00:33:07,562
I can't believe you, nor that child.

421
00:33:09,282 --> 00:33:15,662
Because I didn't want to believe it to be true. I didn't even
contact you and was completely out of it the entire day.

422
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:21,782
Is it all true? Is she really that sick?

423
00:33:27,332 --> 00:33:33,512
I'm sorry, mom. You haven't even
recovered yet, [and] this is difficult.

424
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:40,572
So... you're going to stay with her?

425
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:44,812
Yeah.

426
00:33:50,732 --> 00:33:57,621
Mom, I need some
encouragement from you now.

427
00:33:57,622 --> 00:34:01,361
I even want to be comforted by a kitten.
That's how I feel.

428
00:34:01,362 --> 00:34:08,132
So don't say obvious things that
I can't be helped or something.

429
00:34:12,142 --> 00:34:14,262
Do you like her that much?

430
00:34:16,812 --> 00:34:21,992
Couldn't you tell? You knew it all already.

431
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:25,602
How much time does she have left?

432
00:34:33,292 --> 00:34:39,342
Why would you say that? You lived too!
You were dying, but you're survived.

433
00:34:40,332 --> 00:34:46,031
She's going to live too! I'm going
to live with her for a long time.

434
00:34:46,032 --> 00:34:50,352
I'm going to live with her
and die a day earlier.

435
00:34:59,202 --> 00:35:01,782
I'm sorry, Ji Hoon.

436
00:35:02,652 --> 00:35:06,812
I understand how you're feeling,
but I can't lose to you.

437
00:35:08,242 --> 00:35:11,651
When a son says that he'd hold on to the
bristle-grass and jump into a fiery pit.

438
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:13,932
What kind of mother would like that?

439
00:35:14,752 --> 00:35:19,551
Do you know what a difficult
and scary family that will be?

440
00:35:19,552 --> 00:35:22,202
Have you really thought about it?

441
00:35:24,052 --> 00:35:29,701
I feel sorry for that child [Hye Soo].
I know she's a good person, too.

442
00:35:29,702 --> 00:35:33,602
But Ji Hoon...

443
00:35:40,122 --> 00:35:47,282
Don't worry, Mom. It's not a fire pit.
I'm doing it because I want to.

444
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:29,031
Oh, Hye Soo.

445
00:36:29,032 --> 00:36:32,212
Should have dinner together tonight?

446
00:36:33,252 --> 00:36:36,502
I've been indebted to my friend,

447
00:36:37,482 --> 00:36:39,292
so I wanted to treat her.

448
00:36:40,702 --> 00:36:43,921
Let's cook and eat together
at my friend's house.

449
00:36:43,922 --> 00:36:46,232
You're inviting me right now?

450
00:36:53,802 --> 00:36:56,632
It's true. I am inviting you.

451
00:36:57,772 --> 00:37:02,251
What do you want to eat? You
like kimchi stew and japchae.

452
00:37:02,252 --> 00:37:07,312
And you don't like broccoli. I know
something about your food preference.

453
00:37:09,222 --> 00:37:11,781
I studied a lot.

454
00:37:11,782 --> 00:37:14,552
OK. I'll be there a little later.

455
00:37:16,882 --> 00:37:19,731
Who are you talking to to be so beaming?

456
00:37:19,732 --> 00:37:22,912
Uncle, I was coming to see you actually.

457
00:37:23,812 --> 00:37:28,032
There's rumor your dad's
still without some sense.

458
00:37:29,912 --> 00:37:36,322
I don't know what it is but your
family is so rich but hollow too.

459
00:37:37,032 --> 00:37:43,588
Geez, even if I only get to eat vegetables and
drink water, living without stress is the best.

460
00:37:43,612 --> 00:37:45,271
Goodbye.

461
00:37:45,272 --> 00:37:47,232
Rest up.

462
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:51,832
Madame and Executive just left the country.

463
00:37:56,562 --> 00:37:59,791
Chairman Seo.

464
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:03,971
Weather's nice too, should we go play golf?

465
00:38:03,972 --> 00:38:09,691
Yes, if it works for Na Yoon too, the time.
Oh, I'll call you back.

466
00:38:09,692 --> 00:38:14,921
Oh, Na Yoon. I was going to call
you anyway. It's good you came.

467
00:38:14,922 --> 00:38:17,041
I had something to say to you.

468
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:20,342
Sit down. I have something
to say to you, too.

469
00:38:27,682 --> 00:38:32,191
About Ji Hoon. Soon, he's going to
come back to the way things were.

470
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:37,991
I sent him away and told him to stay with
bated breath until the noises calm down.

471
00:38:37,992 --> 00:38:42,271
And that woman [Hye Soo], you don't
ever need to worry about her.

472
00:38:42,272 --> 00:38:46,301
Now all that's left is stuff that
will settle on its own soon.

473
00:38:46,302 --> 00:38:52,651
Chairman. From now on, don't
associate me with Ji Hoon.

474
00:38:52,652 --> 00:38:58,541
Whether it's Ji Hoon or that woman, I'm
not going to be concerned about them.

475
00:38:58,542 --> 00:39:04,232
I don't want to ruin my life any
longer by hanging on so pointlessly.

476
00:39:05,022 --> 00:39:08,902
I'm not that innocent or romantic.

477
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:16,862
I think I should end here so that I can
still have some redeemable memories.

485
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:04,921
Mom. - Hmm? Can I eat this?

486
00:40:04,922 --> 00:40:07,552
Of course! You can eat any of it.

487
00:40:10,262 --> 00:40:13,451
Are we having some party today?

488
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,061
Yea, a party.

489
00:40:15,062 --> 00:40:16,281
What party?

490
00:40:16,282 --> 00:40:22,521
With Ahjussi and Auntie, the four of us, let's have a party.
Mom's going to display my cooking skills first time in a while.

491
00:40:22,522 --> 00:40:28,201
I'm thankful to ahjusshi; I'm thankful to aunt
[Joo Yeon]. I'm thankful to my Eun Sung too.

492
00:40:28,202 --> 00:40:31,251
Mom wants to treat you guys.

493
00:40:31,252 --> 00:40:33,451
Thankful to me for what?

494
00:40:33,452 --> 00:40:37,241
Thankful because Eun Sung is Eun Sung.

495
00:40:37,242 --> 00:40:38,932
Nah.

496
00:40:46,282 --> 00:40:48,442
Mom, are you okay?

497
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,342
Yea, I'm alright.

498
00:41:02,802 --> 00:41:06,841
Mom! Mom!

499
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:10,211
Eun Sung, don't come closer! Don't come!

500
00:41:10,212 --> 00:41:14,071
Stay there. Stay right there!

501
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:18,801
Eun Sung, leave. Leave for a little bit.

502
00:41:18,802 --> 00:41:24,501
Eun Sung, I'm sorry. Mom's sorry. Sorry.

503
00:41:24,502 --> 00:41:28,841
- Smells good. - Eun Sung, sorry.

504
00:41:28,842 --> 00:41:33,411
Oh, oh, Eun Sung. It's okay, it's okay.
<i>I'm sorry. Sorry.</i>

505
00:41:33,412 --> 00:41:34,822
Hye Soo.

506
00:41:37,482 --> 00:41:40,662
I'm okay. Take Eun Sung out.

507
00:41:42,362 --> 00:41:44,321
Take Eun Sung out of here.

508
00:41:44,322 --> 00:41:51,551
Oh, ok…oh, Eun Sung, aigoo. Do you want to go out
with aunt for a little bit? Aigoo, it's okay.

509
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:56,772
It's okay. It's okay. What a
good girl you are, Eun Sung.

510
00:42:06,242 --> 00:42:08,231
Mom is acting weird.

511
00:42:08,232 --> 00:42:16,041
It's okay. Mom was a
little dizzy, that's why.

512
00:42:16,042 --> 00:42:18,352
Why is she dizzy?

513
00:42:20,722 --> 00:42:24,871
Motion sickness. Eun Sung knows
what motion sickness means, right?

514
00:42:24,872 --> 00:42:30,172
I think your mom rode in the car for
a long time earlier today. Right?

515
00:43:10,072 --> 00:43:14,931
Eun Sung, can you stay by
yourself for just a moment?

516
00:43:14,932 --> 00:43:17,771
I'm going to go help Mom
and come right back.

517
00:43:17,772 --> 00:43:20,451
No, I want to go with you.

518
00:43:20,452 --> 00:43:26,131
It will really, really be just a moment.

519
00:43:26,132 --> 00:43:30,371
Eun Sung, do you want to
play nail polish with me?

520
00:43:30,372 --> 00:43:33,851
What color are you going
to choose for me today?

521
00:43:33,852 --> 00:43:37,091
Hello.

522
00:43:37,092 --> 00:43:39,581
Eun Sung, what's wrong? Hmm?

523
00:43:39,582 --> 00:43:43,481
Would you go inside for me?

524
00:43:43,482 --> 00:43:47,341
I think Hye Soo needs some help.

525
00:43:47,342 --> 00:43:52,252
- Daddy.-Yeah, Eun Sung.
Don't cry, don't cry.

526
00:43:57,092 --> 00:44:01,832
Eun Sung, should we go see the kitties?

00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:35,612
Hye Soo.

528

00:47:32,252 --> 00:47:33,511
Hello.

555
00:47:33,512 --> 00:47:35,491
Our Eun Sung came, too!

556
00:47:35,492 --> 00:47:39,751
Eun Sung, do you want to
go up and see the kitties?

557
00:47:39,752 --> 00:47:43,102
Okay. Come right back.

558
00:47:45,332 --> 00:47:49,031
It's been a long time after Hye Soo quit.

559
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:53,561
You're still beautiful as always.
Did you eat?

560
00:47:53,562 --> 00:47:55,681
Not yet.

561
00:47:55,682 --> 00:48:00,661
Not having eaten until this
hour, how hungry must you be?

562
00:48:00,662 --> 00:48:04,501
Then, please give me something good to eat.

563
00:48:04,502 --> 00:48:06,521
Eun Sung is probably hungry, too.

564
00:48:06,522 --> 00:48:10,441
Eun Sung! Come down quickly
after seeing the kittens!

565
00:48:10,442 --> 00:48:16,601
Ahjusshi said he's going to
buy us some delicious steak!

566
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,112
Steak?

567
00:48:20,332 --> 00:48:23,081
Oh, sounds good! Steak!

568
00:48:23,082 --> 00:48:27,021
I like it medium well done. So
that no blood is showing, okay?

569
00:48:27,022 --> 00:48:31,872
Okay! You're just like me.
I don't like blood either.

570
00:48:32,622 --> 00:48:37,352
Jet Black, Chubbie, and Cutie.

<i>We'll be back after eating dinner.

572

I guess Eun Sung will be
back after eating dinner.

573
00:49:07,682 --> 00:49:09,682
I saw.

574
00:49:12,762 --> 00:49:14,871
It feels like it's going
to get hot already.

575
00:49:14,872 --> 00:49:17,112
You're too much. Seriously.

576
00:49:18,102 --> 00:49:20,802
Should I try some of this?

577
00:49:22,572 --> 00:49:24,041
How is it?

578
00:49:24,042 --> 00:49:27,092
Hey, mmmm.

579
00:49:28,222 --> 00:49:29,811
You're not a chef for nothing.

580
00:49:29,812 --> 00:49:33,132
-Really?-Yeah. Really.

581
00:49:34,112 --> 00:49:35,931
Thanks.

582
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:38,132
No need for thanks.

583
00:49:38,952 --> 00:49:41,142
I have something to say.

584
00:49:42,982 --> 00:49:45,372
I said that I have something to say.

585
00:49:50,492 --> 00:49:53,382
When I'm gone,

586
00:49:55,802 --> 00:49:59,182
will you promise me that you'll
return to your rightful spot?

587
00:50:01,382 --> 00:50:04,972
I'll work hard at being
your wife until then.

588
00:50:16,292 --> 00:50:18,961
Kang Hye Soo,

589
00:50:18,962 --> 00:50:22,871
Ah, and also about Eun Sung,

590
00:50:22,872 --> 00:50:27,501
will you see her often and
be her daddy long legs?

591
00:50:27,502 --> 00:50:30,392
Actually, that's what I'm most sorry about.

592
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:34,952
I would like you to be her daddy long legs.

593
00:50:42,022 --> 00:50:44,282
Are you joking with me right now?

594
00:50:47,172 --> 00:50:52,822
Who says you can leave? What are you leaving?
Why do you keep looking that direction?

595
00:50:58,642 --> 00:51:00,992
Cancel everything you just said.

596
00:51:03,692 --> 00:51:05,642
Cancel it!

597
00:51:14,802 --> 00:51:18,492
I understand. I'll cancel it.

598
00:51:21,542 --> 00:51:24,272
Cancel, cancel it.

599
00:51:28,802 --> 00:51:31,522
I'm sorry but I'll go and rest.

600
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:34,642
I'm getting dizzy.

601
00:51:52,002 --> 00:51:54,372
<i>I'll get some sleep.</i>

602
00:51:55,602 --> 00:51:57,952
Finish eating before you go.

603
00:52:05,952 --> 00:52:08,931
Okay, I will.

604
00:52:08,932 --> 00:52:11,632
Continue to act so foolishly then.

605
00:52:12,652 --> 00:52:15,972
Whether you leave or not,
do whatever you want.

606
00:52:48,132 --> 00:52:50,642
I'm just eating it because
it will go to waste.

607
00:53:13,672 --> 00:53:15,682
It tastes good.

608
00:54:34,222 --> 00:54:38,321
<i>Mother-in-law</i>

609
00:54:38,322 --> 00:54:41,221
Yes

610
00:54:41,222 --> 00:54:45,401
Listen carefully to what I have to say.

611
00:54:45,402 --> 00:54:49,792
You're not thinking that
you're dying, are you?

612
00:54:54,642 --> 00:54:57,002
Unbelievable.

613
00:54:59,762 --> 00:55:04,021
What you said earlier, I'm going
to pretend I didn't hear it.

614
00:55:04,022 --> 00:55:09,002
<i>After sending away my son like that,</i>

615
00:55:09,792 --> 00:55:12,582
I can't send my daughter-in-law
like that, too.

616
00:55:13,712 --> 00:55:17,402
Make a firm resolution to live, okay?

617
00:55:18,832 --> 00:55:20,761
<i>You have to live.</i>

618
00:55:20,762 --> 00:55:26,181
Think of Eun Sung, and live
