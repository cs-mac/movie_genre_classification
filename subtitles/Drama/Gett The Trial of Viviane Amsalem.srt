THE TRIAL OF VIVIANE AMSALEM

3
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:49,751
I'm sad to say, Your Honor,
that the husband, Elisha Amsalem,

4
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,130
has refused to come to court
and to cooperate.

5
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,132
We don't even know his position

6
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,428
on my client's request
for a divorce.

7
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,306
She filed three years ago
and hasn't lived at home since.

8
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:05,184
For three years her husband
has kept silent

9
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,104
except once, when he visited her
after her brother's death.

10
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,148
What did he say then?

11
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,233
He asked her to come home.

12
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,862
- What was her response?
- She asked him for a divorce.

13
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,907
Mr. Amsalem,
don't you have an advocate?

14
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,286
No, Your Honor.

15
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,580
Would you like to grant her
a divorce?

16
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,664
No, Your Honor.

17
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:31,251
This woman has not lived at home
for three years.

18
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,586
Yes, Your Honor.

19
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:36,423
- Are you willing to take her back?
- Yes, Your Honor.

20
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,384
Do you suspect her of adultery?

21
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,973
- I can't hear you, sir.
- No, Honorable Rabbi.

22
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,601
- Your Honor...
- Silence, please.

23
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,604
Are you sure about this?

24
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,483
Yes, Your Honor.

25
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,153
Why don't you want to grant
this woman a divorce?

26
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,492
Viviane, come home, I beg you.
There's nothing out there...

27
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,661
We speak Hebrew in this court.

28
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,704
We must understand!

29
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,123
Come, let's forgive and forget.

30
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,752
The kids want you back, too.
Come home, Viviane.

31
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,545
We'll start all over.

32
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,715
She seems faithful.
She doesn't want him anymore.

33
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,717
Translate, don't interpret.

34
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,971
The children want her back.

35
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,640
Have all the kids left home?

36
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,810
All but the youngest,
who lives with his father.

37
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,436
And his mother abandoned him.

38
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,606
She sees him every day
and cooks him meals,

39
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,235
which her sister-in-law brings
when the father's not home.

40
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,195
And who takes care of this woman?

41
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:45,784
My client lives with her brother
and his wife as well as her sister--

42
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,828
They can all attest to her decency.

43
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,832
How has your client supported herself
since she left home?

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,961
My client has had a profession,
for over 20 years now.

45
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,587
She's a hairdresser.

46
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,133
Has her husband supported her
since she left home?

47
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,387
No, my client has supported herself,
and her children, by herself.

48
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,515
- So she's demanding alimony?
- No.

49
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,809
- So what does she want?
- A divorce.

50
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,186
Your Honors, she wants a divorce.

51
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,274
Mr. Amsalem, why are you refusing?

52
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,692
Your Honor,
as you can see--

53
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,779
Quiet, please!
The question wasn't addressed to you.

54
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,741
Mr. Amsalem, answer the question.

55
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,874
Never, Viviane.

56
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,418
Never, Viviane.

57
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,590
Did the husband beat his wife
or treat her violently?

58
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,259
It depends on
what you mean by violence.

59
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,888
If you mean physical violence,
he didn't harm her.

60
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,350
He didn't harm her.
Did he provide for all her needs?

61
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,393
- That's debatable.
- Don't be smart.

62
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,730
Did he provide her with money, food?

63
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,232
My client lives separately.

64
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,861
Does the husband fool around?
Commit adultery?

65
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,613
No, Your Honor.

66
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:09,117
Does the husband have a deformation
that repels the woman?

67
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,452
No, Your Honor.

68
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,705
Did the husband threaten
his wife in any way?

69
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,250
Is the woman's life in danger somehow?

70
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,420
As I said, he hasn't spoken
with her for three years now.

71
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,422
For better or worse.

72
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,258
They haven't spoken for three years?

73
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:29,429
She won't speak to me,
I want to speak with her.

74
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:36,728
- So what are the grounds for divorce?
- She doesn't love him anymore.

75
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,481
- No grounds for divorce.
- They don't live together.

76
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,609
Rabbi De Medina ruled:
that 18 months apart

77
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,236
are grounds for divorce.

78
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,029
- There are grounds.
- No grounds.

79
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,949
That's an opinion, not a ruling.

80
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,325
Rule for "Reconciliation."

81
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,785
Sir,

82
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:55,455
are you willing to take
this woman back

83
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,041
and give her another chance

84
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,294
to be a faithful wife and mother?

85
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,547
Yes, Your Honor.

86
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,551
I'm not going back.

87
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,928
I'm not going back.

88
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,972
We'll see about that.

89
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,808
He said, "We'll see about that."

90
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,397
Viviane Amsalem,

91
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,400
for three years
you've lived away from home,

92
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,235
and he wants you back.

93
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,696
I suggest you go home.

94
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:32,617
Please, try your very best
to save your marriage and family,

95
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:36,204
and with God's help,
we won't see you here again.

96
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,331
This hearing is adjourned.

97
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,504
Haim, see the couple out, please.

98
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:49,468
Advocate Carmel Ben Tovim,
next time wear a skullcap.

99
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,891
What's the next case?

100
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,520
SIX MONTHS LATER

101
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,742
Come here, please.

102
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,285
Come in.

103
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,246
Come in.

104
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,042
Bring the husband in, too.

105
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,962
- He's late.
- We've no time to waste.

106
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,090
Let the next couple in
and you two wait outside.

107
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,719
We fear that my client's husband
won't come.

108
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,638
Then why did you come?

109
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,933
Two days ago,
the husband said he'd come.

110
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,477
But later that day,
he decided not to.

111
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,689
The next day, he said he'd come
and then cancelled again.

112
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:45,815
Impossible to predict.

113
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,278
Why did you come
if the husband said he wouldn't?

114
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,406
My client thought
he was just threatening.

115
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:58,328
We'll wait a few minutes,
perhaps he'll come.

116
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,955
Wait outside, please.

117
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:02,707
Thank you.

118
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,003
Did your client
return to her husband?

119
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,923
- Yes. For three months.
- And?

120
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,133
She had to leave home.

121
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,428
Had to? The Head of the Court
recommended six months.

122
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,139
He wouldn't speak,
so she decided to leave.

123
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,267
What do you mean, "decided"?

124
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,394
It doesn't matter,
Your Honor, she left.

125
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,438
That's why the husband
decided not to come.

126
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,149
Do you support
the husband's actions?

127
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,197
We'll wait a few minutes.

128
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,201
Your Honor, it's a trick.

129
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,329
There'll be no hearing without him.
That's enough for today.

130
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,540
Haim, bring in the next couple.

131
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,670
TWO MONTHS LATER

132
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,972
He won't come.

133
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,517
Let's wait.

134
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,106
We've been waiting
for an hour and a half.

135
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,942
What can we do?

136
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,907
Carmel, your shirt...

137
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,327
Tuck it in.

138
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,829
Okay?

139
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,715
Adva and Shmulik Sade,
please come in.

140
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,426
- Haim. If I may...
- No, not yet.

141
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,219
Put on a skullcap, please.

142
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,808
Your Honor,
we're waiting for the husband and...

143
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:00,867
Let's go.

144
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,996
Let's wait a little longer.

145
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,093
What time is it?

146
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,262
Almost 10:00.

147
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,185
Normally, when a person is
summoned to court, he appears.

148
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,020
THREE MONTHS LATER

149
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,773
In respect of my client's rights,
impose sanctions on the husband!

150
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,027
Since the law favors a husband's will
over a wife's wishes,

151
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,570
at least he could show up!

152
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:41,491
What are you angry about?
We summoned him.

153
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,284
What else can we do?

154
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,413
Everything in your power.

155
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,623
Who is here on his behalf?

156
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,377
Speak up!

157
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,129
Hello, Viviane.

158
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,214
I'm the husband's messenger.

159
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,300
Why didn't he bother
to come himself?

160
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,761
I don't know, Your Honor.

161
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,304
What do you have to say?

162
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,642
Your Honor,
the husband asked me

163
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,562
to tell you that
he will not appear in court

164
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,231
until his wife comes home.

165
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,899
I'm not going back.

166
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,277
I'll have you removed.

167
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,946
In my court you speak
when spoken to.

168
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,906
I'm not going back again.

169
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,241
Look, good woman,

170
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,785
return for the period
I recommend.

171
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,663
Your Honor,
what is this disgrace?

172
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:29,789
Calm down, you.

173
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,169
You know we can't force
the husband at this stage.

174
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,255
You're bending my client's will.

175
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,884
Does it bother you
that she returns of her own free will?

176
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,511
Her own free will?
Your Honor!

177
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,598
Madam, help me and I'll help you.

178
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,475
Return to your home,

179
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,060
and if you cannot reach an accord,

180
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,730
I give you my word,
before these witnesses,

181
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:57,025
I will force him to appear in court,
like it or not.

182
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:01,154
The husband wants reconciliation,
and so do we. She must go home.

183
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,448
This hearing is adjourned.

184
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,746
Carmel Ben Tovim, you listen...

185
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,456
FIVE MONTHS LATER

186
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,583
You keep shouting.

187
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,460
Don't raise your voice...

188
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,630
It's a religious court.
Don't show contempt!

189
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,591
- I'm not.
- You're shouting and...

190
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,344
You're in contempt
and you're shouting.

191
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:28,473
You won't even give me
15 minutes.

192
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:32,393
Gentlemen, we can't communicate
with screams and shouts.

193
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,771
Pardon me, Your Honor.

194
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,233
My client fulfilled
her husband's conditions

195
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,901
and he doesn't do his part!

196
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,070
But they live together now?

197
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,198
- Yes, as requested.
- Then what's wrong?

198
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,909
Everything is wrong,
that's why we're here.

199
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,078
Why are you fanning the flames again?

200
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:54,040
The husband's behavior is infuriating.
How long must my client wait?

201
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,167
Look, I stand by my word,

202
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,629
although I repeat:
I cannot force him to appear.

203
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,006
Why not, Your Honor?

204
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,718
His refusal to answer your summons
constitutes valid grounds.

205
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,138
- What are you waiting for?
- You're out of order, Carmel.

206
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,099
I will do so
because this poor woman

207
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,269
fulfilled her obligations
to me and to her husband.

208
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,772
If the husband doesn't appear
at the next hearing,

209
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,940
in three months...

210
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,568
Three months, Your Honor!
Three months?

211
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:22,986
Carmel, shut up!

212
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,321
You're annoying me!

213
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,992
If the husband doesn't appear
at the next hearing,

214
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,369
three months from today,

215
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,330
I will take exception
with the law

216
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,750
and suspend
his driver's license for a year.

217
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,295
Really?

218
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,463
He doesn't have one.

219
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,173
He doesn't have one.

220
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,343
No license?

221
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:48,928
I see.

222
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,140
- Was it revoked?
- No, he never had one.

223
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,852
His credit cards will be blocked.

224
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,022
He doesn't use credit cards.

225
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,775
His bank account will be blocked.

226
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,820
A joint account?

227
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,906
Even if they're separated?

228
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,867
My client deposits her salary
into their account.

229
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,536
They're still paying off
their mortgage.

230
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,872
How many years are left?

231
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,498
11 years.

232
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,376
You want us
to threaten him with jail?!

233
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,753
Precisely, Your Honor.

234
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:26,132
He wants reconciliation,
it's she who refuses, not him.

235
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,054
Bring him here,
and we'll try to appeal to him.

236
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,766
He won't appear,
the last four hearings are proof!

237
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,100
What's going to change?

238
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,060
Your Honor...

239
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,394
Just a minute.

240
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,104
Let me hear her now.

241
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,194
Your Honors,

242
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,405
I upheld my side of the bargain.

243
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,408
Make him appear.

244
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,953
You, as promised.

245
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,376
Haim, bring the lady some water.

246
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,461
I don't want water.

247
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,676
You promised, Your Honor.

248
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,779
Let's not mince words.

249
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,824
I'll do all I can to make him appear.

250
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:58,933
THREE MONTHS LATER - A YEAR
AND A HALF SINCE THE TRIAL BEGAN

251
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,311
Welcome, sir.

252
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,690
Thank you, Your Honor.

253
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,942
We've waited for you a long time.

254
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:12,363
Your refusal to appear
shows contempt for this court

255
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,116
and wastes our precious time.

256
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,077
Fulfill this court's orders

257
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,246
or we will harden our hearts.

258
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,664
Understood?

259
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,207
Yes, Your Honor.

260
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,084
Have you any regrets?

261
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,836
Yes, Your Honor.

262
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,088
What have you come to tell us?

263
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,924
Your wife fulfilled your every wish,

264
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,969
yet your marriage
is not working.

265
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,388
Have you made up your mind?

266
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,475
Will you grant this woman
a divorce?

267
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,535
No, Your Honor.

268
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,955
- You won't grant her a divorce?
- No.

269
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,583
Then why are you here?
To say no?

270
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,501
Yes.

271
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,461
Do you realize

272
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,798
that if you continue to refuse

273
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,051
I can force you
to grant her a divorce?

274
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,178
On what grounds, Your Honor?

275
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,430
On what grounds?

276
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,224
Yes, on what grounds?

277
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,518
After driving your wife crazy,

278
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,937
you want to drive us crazy too?

279
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,522
Your Honor,

280
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,192
we can't live together.
We aren't compatible.

281
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,568
Be quiet!

282
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:36,739
No court in the world can oblige
this woman to live with that man.

283
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,243
Do you hear?
She doesn't want to live with you.

284
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,829
It's my punishment.

285
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:43,913
It's in His hands.

286
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,084
If you see her as your punishment,

287
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,837
grant her a divorce
and free yourself, too.

288
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,005
No, Your Honor.

289
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,929
I don't want to live with him.

290
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,390
I don't want to.

291
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,354
Listen, in 15 days you will
bring witnesses before me.

292
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,357
If they don't provide me with cause,

293
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:15,153
you will be sent home
to work it out!

294
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,364
I need grounds!

295
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,831
- I can't talk right now.
- Goodbye, Your Honors.

296
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:42,138
TWO WEEKS LATER

297
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,600
Hello, Carmel.

298
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,768
Hello.

299
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,189
It's been a long time.

300
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,154
- Is Elisha here?
- Yes, he's in the restroom.

301
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,123
If we keep this gracious,
it'll be all right.

302
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,343
How's your mother?

303
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,303
She's fine, thanks.

304
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,431
Your father was...

305
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,603
What a prodigy.

306
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,064
He always knew...

307
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,358
Knew what?

308
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,570
He knew a lot--
A lot of things.

309
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,447
Yes.

310
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,325
He knew many things.

311
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,411
Amsalem?

312
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,247
The husband.

313
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,582
Leave it to me, don't talk.

314
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,008
Didn't we say
that you'd bring witnesses?

315
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,094
Your Honor.

316
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,598
We couldn't gather them,
people work, they're busy.

317
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,977
I'm here on behalf
of my brother,

318
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,229
and may my sister-in-law
pardon me,

319
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,731
I have no intention to slander.

320
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,985
Your qualities are well-known,
Rabbi Shimon. Speak.

321
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,571
This is my brother,
ten years my junior.

322
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,574
Back in Morocco, he was
a respected and admired man.

323
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:29,120
Your Honor,
we are a family of scholars,

324
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,579
people of the Book.

325
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,499
And in my humble opinion,

326
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,627
perhaps the couple's incompatibility

327
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:40,256
stems from the inability
of my sister-in-law, Viviane,

328
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,967
to run a kosher home
and observe Jewish law,

329
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,011
as my brother would like.

330
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,931
If she'd only follow the laws,
as my brother wishes,

331
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,017
he would give her the world.

332
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,768
And yet you demand

333
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:56,063
that this man grants her a divorce?

334
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,732
What for?
What for?

335
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,403
Your brother didn't appear in court
when summoned

336
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,156
and he forced us to be
heavy-handed with him.

337
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:10,328
What do you ask this man to do?
To renounce his Torah?

338
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:14,415
She doesn't allow him
to wear a skullcap outside.

339
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,459
And that hurts my brother.

340
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,919
He wishes to return to his roots.

341
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:22,840
Which should he choose:
his religion and faith or his wife?

342
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,926
He refuses to give up either,

343
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,722
which is commendable.
It's a serious problem.

344
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,682
That's my opinion.

345
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,978
Do you think that herein lies
both the problem and the solution?

346
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,065
The beginning of a solution,
Your Honor.

347
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,778
I won't bad-mouth this woman,

348
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,781
but my brother too,
suffered from his wife's wrath.

349
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,991
And kept silent.

350
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:49,992
Your Honor,
if I may...

351
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,454
What does observance
have to do with incompatibility?

352
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,997
Carmel, your late father...

353
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,751
My father has nothing to do with this,
please leave him out of it.

354
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,256
How can we not mention and praise

355
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:07,176
Rabbi Sasson Ben Tovim,
venerable as he was,

356
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,803
when his son stands before us?

357
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,221
Not before you, Shimon.

358
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,141
Your father was a guiding light
to many good men.

359
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,811
Many good men.

360
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,690
I'm not standing before you.

361
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,610
We're standing before
these honorable Rabbis

362
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,987
to find a solution for this couple.

363
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,030
True.

364
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,116
My client is a secular woman.

365
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,617
And when they married?

366
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:36,163
When they got engaged she was 15,
and came from a religious family, too.

367
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,624
But she knew she was marrying
into a renowned rabbinic family.

368
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,128
Her family is just
as respectable as his.

369
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,629
Thank God.

370
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,549
I'm certain that for another man

371
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:49,427
my client would even wear a wig.

372
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,971
If she left religion,
it's because of him.

373
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:52,847
Because of him!

374
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:56,642
He and his deeds
ruined religion for her.

375
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,602
Carmel, be brief.

376
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,230
We have no need for theories,
just facts.

377
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,398
It's a fact.

378
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,734
What did he do, God forbid,
to make her hate her faith?

379
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,363
Why doesn't the husband
have a driver's license?

380
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:13,033
- Driving can desecrate the Sabbath.
- Not on a weekday.

381
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,369
My brother is afraid
that if he had one

382
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,414
his wife would make him
desecrate the Sabbath.

383
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:22,543
Many God-fearing Jews
have driver's licenses.

384
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,923
My brother never had great eyesight,

385
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,468
which is another reason
to avoid driving.

386
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,804
We are men of Torah, why "excuses"?

387
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,724
- Excuses...
- Why excuses?

388
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,393
Excuses are a dime a dozen,
Shimon, my friend.

389
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,896
What does this court prefer,
observance or domestic harmony?

390
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,445
Without witnesses,
we won't continue.

391
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:53,115
Why? Even with 10 witnesses,
no grounds will be found.

392
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:57,161
This hearing is now adjourned.
A notice will be mailed to you, go.

393
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,790
You're wasting the court's time.

394
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,730
Excuse me.

395
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,106
After you.

396
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,620
We don't want witnesses either.

397
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,497
TWO MONTHS LATER

398
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,541
They're both stubborn.

399
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,627
I can't force him
to grant her a divorce.

400
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,421
And I can't force her to return,

401
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:50,422
I'm sorry to say.

402
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,508
Therefore,
I summoned witnesses.

403
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,970
This isn't a murder trial,

404
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,264
this woman wants a divorce.

405
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,933
Who's to say what happens
behind closed doors,

406
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,435
you're trying to read
their thoughts.

407
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:08,190
Don't doubt our abilities,
granted by both Heaven and Earth.

408
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:11,944
This woman's truth is hers alone.

409
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,989
My client made up her mind
30 years ago.

410
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,408
So why didn't she ask
for a divorce 30 years ago?

411
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,828
She was very young
and she lacked the means,

412
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,663
both physical and emotional.

413
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,541
The court should not
dishonor this woman.

414
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,085
Let Rabbi Solomon decide what to do.

415
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,213
We've waited for his ruling
for years now

416
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,424
but he's taking his time.

417
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:38,095
- Is His Honor afraid to rule?
- One more insult and we're done.

418
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,307
Rabbi Solomon has
the ability to rule

419
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,434
on the most complex cases.

420
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,271
I have a question.
Are you married?

421
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,940
Do you have a family?

422
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:53,861
No, Your Honor.

423
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,738
The truth comes out.

424
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:58,198
Why not?
Do you have a defect?

425
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,203
I'm not on trial, Your Honor.

426
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,873
Everyone is on trial.

427
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,710
Every man's life is on trial.

428
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:14,340
Yours is worth the same
as that of your client, the defendant,

429
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:18,344
and every witness who appears here.

430
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:19,720
True.

431
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,097
We are all witnesses,

432
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:23,974
all of us, Your Honor.

433
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:29,355
Without witnesses, we won't continue.
Haim, please bring the witness in.

434
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:33,817
So?

435
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,277
Let's go.

436
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,907
Your name?

437
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,660
Emil Amzaleg,
son of Shmuel and Rachel,

438
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:46,288
Viviane Amsalem's eldest brother.

439
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,916
Do you know the Amsalem couple well?

440
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,293
Of course, Your Honor.
She's my sister.

441
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,420
I know her well.

442
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,590
She's a good wife
and a wonderful mother.

443
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,384
The truth is, Your Honor,

444
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,511
as far as I know,
she's done

445
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,681
everything she could
to stay with this man...

446
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:08,018
Elisha, whom we love and respect.

447
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,020
He's a wise man...

448
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,814
A good man.

449
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,024
But the truth is, Your Honor...

450
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,735
they just don't get along.

451
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,613
We tried to talk to them,

452
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,074
to settle matters between them,

453
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,659
but...

454
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,203
it never worked.

455
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,207
All in all,
we like him a lot.

456
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,291
When they married,

457
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,210
we were glad.

458
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,592
What's that look?
Isn't it true?

459
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,304
Don't interrupt the witness.

460
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,268
Believe me, Your Honor,

461
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,520
we always said,
"What do you want?

462
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:55,858
Elisha is a good man. Where will
you find another husband like him?

463
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,445
He gives you his salary,
he helps around the house,

464
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,071
he doesn't throw away money,

465
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,366
he doesn't fool around,
he doesn't gamble,

466
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,910
not on cards nor on the lottery,

467
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,329
he doesn't beat you,

468
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,331
Sister, it's in your hands."

469
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,085
He always agreed
with her decisions.

470
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:19,423
He comes to our home,
and honors us on holidays,

471
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,885
and treats us to his beautiful voice.

472
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:27,598
When he sings in synagogue
even the birds stop to listen!

473
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,769
That's it, everyone will tell you,
he's the perfect man.

474
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,771
What are you trying to say?

475
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,105
I think, Your Honor,

476
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,859
that my sister,
as much as I love her,

477
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:42,362
is hard-headed, stubborn.

478
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:46,366
We've tried to talk to her,
to no end.

479
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,453
I told him time and time again,

480
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:53,373
"Elisha, you have a problem.

481
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,542
A woman needs a strong hand.

482
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,587
A woman needs boundaries."

483
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,464
But he...

484
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,382
It's not his way.

485
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,512
I, personally, have always wished
she'd go back to him.

486
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,555
Didn't I tell you?

487
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,977
Your sister's husband, Elisha,
an honest man, right?

488
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,438
My client also says
he's a good man,

489
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,858
but he isn't a good husband for her.

490
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,194
Carmel, watch your mouth!

491
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,030
He's a good man
and a good husband.

492
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,450
How should I know
if they're compatible?

493
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,035
What does it matter?

494
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:33,288
Is my wife right for me?
No.

495
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:37,251
I make her right for me,
and that's that. No nonsense.

496
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,546
- Your Honor, may I?
- Go ahead.

497
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:41,547
Emil Amzaleg,

498
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,675
is your sister a good wife?

499
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,302
A good wife, a woman of valor.

500
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,846
And is he a good man?

501
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,182
You heard what I said.

502
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,102
Head and shoulders
above the crowd.

503
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:59,022
In your opinion, having seen
them together for over 20 years,

504
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,943
do you think they've had
a good life together?

505
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,956
We're waiting.

506
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,082
Speak.

507
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,213
No, Your Honor.

508
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,757
And in your opinion,

509
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:29,136
has your sister suffered in
her marriage to this man?

510
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,266
Answer.

511
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,351
She's suffered a lot.

512
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,187
Good, describe their married life

513
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,523
in a word or two.

514
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,532
We're waiting.

515
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,493
I'm thinking, Your Honor.

516
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,580
That's a tough question.

517
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,165
Answer, Emil.

518
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,711
Bitter as heck.

519
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,087
That's all.

520
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,506
Does the defense
have any questions?

521
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,050
Yes, Your Honor.

522
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,761
Just a few questions, if I may.

523
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,095
Go ahead.

524
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,891
Honorable Emil,
family man that you are,

525
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,561
is my brother good to your sister?

526
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,105
Of course, Rabbi Shimon.

527
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,733
And has he given her

528
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,818
everything he could?

529
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,445
Above and beyond.

530
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:32,699
And did they build
an exemplary Jewish home?

531
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,368
Yes, Rabbi Shimon.

532
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,746
And did they raise children
to the glory of Israel?

533
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,207
And how!

534
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,794
If you answered positively
to these questions,

535
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,879
why should we separate them?

536
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:51,301
I never said we should separate them,
God forbid...

537
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,511
Thank you, sir.

538
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,600
You may go, Emil Amzaleg.

539
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,851
Ignorants!

540
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,064
Haim, see the witness out.

541
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:08,568
Thank you.
Just perfect.

542
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,903
Thank you, Emil.

543
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,701
The witness, Ms. Evelyn, please.

544
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,418
Madam.

545
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,756
I just wanted to say hello.
What's the big deal?

546
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,925
She hasn't yet been permitted to speak.

547
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,011
State your full name.

548
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,512
Sure.

549
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,975
Evelyn Ben Chouchan, daughter of
Massouda and Jacob Ben Chouchan.

550
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,727
For the defense?

551
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:42,978
The defense?

552
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,314
I'm the sister-in-law of Emil,
who's just spoken.

553
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,775
- On our behalf.
- Let's begin.

554
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,360
Your relation to the plaintiff?

555
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,572
I live with my sister Rachel
and her husband.

556
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:54,740
For how long?

557
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,492
Eight years, Your Honors.

558
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,037
The plaintiff lives with you?

559
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,039
Yes, in the yard.

560
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,834
- Are you in close contact?
- What do you mean? Of course!

561
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,920
As soon as she gets home,
I'm at her place.

562
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:12,883
I also take the food she cooks
to her son and to...

563
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,259
her husband.

564
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,595
Every day? To her husband?

565
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,348
Yes, sure. It's not far.
A ten-minute walk.

566
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,143
Not on the Sabbath.

567
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:26,688
Has the plaintiff lived honorably

568
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,649
since you've lived together?

569
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,984
Can I?

570
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,445
Of course!
I know every step she takes.

571
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,281
When she goes to work,
comes home, where she's been...

572
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,366
I also clean her beauty parlor,

573
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,620
almost every day,
for extra income.

574
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,164
We're very close.

575
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,665
Do you know

576
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:49,419
if the plaintiff
has seen other men?

577
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,505
She hasn't.

578
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:55,467
Every day, it's:
home, work, home, work.

579
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,385
You're always home
to see that?

580
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,930
- Where else would I be?
- And you?

581
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,557
Do you go on dates?

582
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,185
Singles' events?

583
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,563
Maybe once or twice.

584
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,941
And the plaintiff never came with you?

585
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:14,694
No, that's for singles,
Viviane's married.

586
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:18,740
Do you know of any suitors
she's had during this time?

587
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:28,750
- No.
- Why did you hesitate?

588
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,168
Your Honor makes me nervous.

589
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,463
Your Honor, my client
has never cheated on her husband.

590
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,758
Cheated? God forbid.
Did I say cheated?

591
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,803
Of course not!
But now that she's available...

592
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,429
No, not available,

593
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:46,309
but since she doesn't live with him
people think she's available,

594
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,729
so they look at her, how not?
And probably they want her...

595
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,690
It's irrelevant.

596
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,984
Of course, it's irrelevant!

597
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:58,155
She hasn't even bought a new dress,
let alone cheated...

598
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,657
We're chaste.

599
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,659
That's how it is.

600
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,120
Your Honors, we never claimed that.

601
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,330
My client doesn't have a lover.

602
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,500
Never! I don't have one,
how could she?

603
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,587
Men have always admired my client.

604
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:17,048
We can summon every man
who ever looked at a married woman.

605
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,216
Ridiculous.

606
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,845
- Your Honor, may I?
- Go ahead, Carmel.

607
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,054
Thank you.

608
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,599
Ms. Ben Chouchan.

609
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:26,850
Yes, Carmel?

610
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,729
How would you describe Viviane?

611
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,649
She's... an amazing woman.

612
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,401
I'm crazy about her.

613
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,236
And Elisha?

614
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,073
Special.

615
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,743
A special man.

616
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:50,040
What would you wish for her?

617
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,001
A good life,
and to end this story.

618
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,753
You can't force it.

619
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,714
How long must one wait, Carmel?
How long?

620
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,007
Right.

621
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:05,263
And while waiting in limbo,
do you think she's happy?

622
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,432
A chained-up dog
has a better life.

623
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,976
She doesn't enjoy a minute.

624
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,895
Thank you, Evelyn.

625
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,022
There you have it, torture.

626
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,982
That's all, Your Honor.

627
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,945
Your Honors, just a few questions.

628
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:20,779
May I?

629
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,573
Go ahead. Come forward.

630
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,033
Thank you.

631
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:30,372
Have you ever lived on your own?

632
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:31,998
No, sir.

633
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:35,085
With my mother,
and when she died, with my sister.

634
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,046
- Never alone.
- So never with a man?

635
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,965
What does it matter, Your Honor?

636
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,133
Pardon me. I'll rephrase.

637
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:45,428
You haven't built a Jewish home,
right?

638
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,848
No, as I said.

639
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,393
I've been single all my life.

640
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,438
- Do you envy Viviane?
- Huh?

641
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,066
Me, envy Viviane?

642
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:01,444
What is this crap?
Is he crazy?

643
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,364
What's my colleague getting at?

644
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:08,702
If she envies her, she might wish
for other women to share her fate.

645
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:11,496
In her position, barren!

646
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,290
What's he talking about?

647
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,084
Don't let him get away with this!

648
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,961
Thank you. You can go now.

649
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,171
What do you want to know?

650
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,048
Make him retract his words!

651
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,467
Thank you.
Your testimony is over.

652
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,512
He ought to retract his statement.

653
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,848
I asked a question.

654
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,559
I didn't ask you anything, Carmel.

655
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,561
Sit down!

656
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,939
I'm Rachel Amzaleg
and I'm married, thank God.

657
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:42,360
So no one can humiliate me
with questions of that kind.

658
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,362
What's there to say?

659
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,157
This woman doesn't want
to live with him.

660
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,243
And I wouldn't live with him
for one day.

661
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,703
There, you see?

662
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,831
The witness is out of order.

663
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,333
No one asked for your opinion.

664
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,377
Why is he talking
to my sister like that?

665
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,630
Don't you dare shout
in my courtroom.

666
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,300
How long have you known
the couple?

667
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,177
For ages, sir.

668
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,345
Your Honor!

669
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,637
Your Honor.

670
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:14,309
I met my husband, Emil,
before Elisha proposed to her.

671
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:19,022
- But they got married first...
- We're talking about the couple.

672
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,691
They aren't compatible.

673
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,028
Oil and water, they don't mix.
That's all.

674
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,156
Why force them to stay together?

675
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,076
- Any questions, Rabbi Shimon?
- Yes, Your Honor.

676
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:37,415
Isn't it hard to share your house
with both your sister and sister-in-law?

677
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:42,754
Not at all!
They can stay with me forever.

678
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,589
You think marriage is a picnic?

679
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,217
They give me both
physical and emotional support.

680
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,553
Your Honor, between us,

681
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,515
it's not that I'm not dying
to marry off my sister Evelyn.

682
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,725
I've been trying for years.

683
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,143
Before we came here,

684
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,312
I told her,
put on makeup,

685
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,940
do your hair,
dress up nice.

686
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,817
At 50, all you can get
is a divorced man.

687
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,193
And they're all here!

688
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,404
Can I continue interrogating?

689
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,863
Go ahead, Rabbi Shimon.

690
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:10,907
"Interrogation"!

691
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,703
Do you speak to the plaintiff?

692
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,290
She lives with me!

693
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,419
And in your conversations,
have you ever tried

694
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,712
to convince her to go back home?

695
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,049
Your Honor,
I've told her time and again

696
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:32,095
that it's best to make up
and move back.

697
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,597
A divorced women in Israel eats shit!

698
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,767
Watch your mouth.

699
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:38,893
Excuse me,

700
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,646
Your Honor, but you tell me

701
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,982
who wants to marry
a divorced woman?

702
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:48,403
I'm telling you,
the Russian immigration did us in!

703
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,613
Did us in!

704
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:54,451
If you're divorced,
all your girlfriends stay away.

705
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,661
They're afraid
you'll steal their husbands.

706
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,289
But I understand her, Your Honor.

707
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:04,002
That man is intolerable!
No woman would stay with him.

708
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,088
Your Honors,
I think the lady has gone too far.

709
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,132
She wasn't asked about Elisha.

710
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,010
30 years of marriage is too much.

711
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,636
If you ask me,

712
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,847
this poor woman paid her debt

713
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,265
long ago.

714
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,101
So enough!
Set her free.

715
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,020
That's enough, get out.

716
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,564
I'm not leaving until I finish.

717
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,107
Get out.

718
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:30,361
I don't want to hear
any more from you, all right?

719
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,281
Emil! What is...

720
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,782
Her purse.

721
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,997
Madam, your purse!

722
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,676
Mrs. Amsalem.

723
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,390
TWO MONTHS LATER

724
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,477
Your name?

725
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,899
Simon Abecassis.

726
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:09,859
Profession?

727
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:10,944
Merchant.

728
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:14,239
- What do you deal in?
- Spices.

729
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,074
Sir,

730
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,451
you are the Amsalem's neighbor.

731
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,161
True.

732
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:21,579
For a long time?

733
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:22,914
True.

734
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,918
What can you tell us about them?

735
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:30,046
What's to tell?
They're like any couple.

736
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,174
I go to synagogue with Elisha.

737
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,510
Viviane and Dona are friends.

738
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,763
We've been next-door neighbors
for 20 years.

739
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:43,017
His kids come over, we go there.
Like brothers.

740
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,728
I couldn't ask for better neighbors.

741
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,065
What kind of husband is he?

742
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,192
An exemplary husband.

743
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,196
- How does he treat his wife?
- Exemplarily.

744
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:10,211
I haven't a bad word to say about him.

745
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,964
He's a man and husband

746
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,591
of example.

747
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,389
Simon, dear,
since you are neighbors,

748
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:25,018
can you tell us
if you've ever heard them fight?

749
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,394
Fight?

750
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,773
Like me and my wife Dona do.

751
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,070
Thank you, that's all.

752
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,072
The witness is dismissed.

753
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,866
If you please.

754
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,993
Come in, madam.

755
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,162
The witness may go.

756
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,706
Stand at the podium.

757
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,334
The witness may go.

758
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,960
- I'm staying.
- No, go.

759
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,629
I do nothing without him.

760
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,463
Your Honor?

761
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,134
Please step back a little,

762
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,553
toward the wall.

763
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,765
Please move, Abcassis. Back.

764
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,018
- Abecassis.
- Excuse me, Abecassis.

765
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,354
Further back, to the pillar.

766
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,732
Behind the pillar, please.

767
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,901
A little more...

768
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,569
Perfect, thank you.

769
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,404
Name and profession?

770
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,782
Dona Abecassis, homemaker.

771
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:23,451
And I work in our spice shop.

772
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,161
Go ahead, Rabbi Shimon.

773
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,000
You were summoned

774
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:35,088
because you may be
the couple's closest friends.

775
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,005
True.

776
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:40,426
We're next-door neighbors
and our doors are always open.

777
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:44,681
When she needs a cup of oil or sugar,
I give her a kilo.

778
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,432
Friends.

779
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,560
Mr. Abecassis, please keep quiet.

780
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:52,021
Mr. Abecassis, please.

781
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,314
Thank you.

782
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,902
Your husband said
that you've never heard

783
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,238
the Amsalems fight or argue.

784
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:01,489
True.

785
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,282
Mr. Abecassis!

786
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,034
Did you ever hear fights?

787
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,954
Nothing special.

788
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,583
Do you think Elisha
is a good husband to Viviane?

789
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,961
- Sure he is.
- Mr. Abecassis!

790
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:18,256
He's a good, respectable man.

791
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,717
Every woman should be so lucky!

792
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,803
My Simon, God bless him,

793
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,889
won't even put
his dirty glass in the sink.

794
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,854
She'll never find another like him.

795
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:36,149
He lets her go out with the children,

796
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,151
or with friends.

797
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:39,986
Whoever heard of that?

798
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:44,323
Would my Simon let me go out alone?

799
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,786
Mrs. Abecassis,
as you know the couple,

800
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:53,875
can you give this court grounds
to force Elisha to divorce her?

801
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,627
God forbid.

802
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,297
Divorce her? For what?

803
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,507
That would be a shame.

804
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:02,508
Thank you, Dona.

805
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,135
No more questions.

806
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,724
20 years together?

807
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,936
Yes, we met at a model housing expo.

808
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,773
Who do you think
is a better husband,

809
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,233
your husband
or Viviane's husband?

810
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,487
That's immaterial, Your Honor.

811
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,156
What a stupid question!

812
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,701
I'm trying to determine
the witness's point of departure.

813
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,036
What departure?

814
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:30,912
Go ahead.

815
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,539
Are you happy with your marriage?

816
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,625
Sure, I'm happy.

817
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,794
In your opinion,

818
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:41,130
what makes your marriage
a happy marriage?

819
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,175
Look, sir, we each have our roles.

820
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:48,054
Simon supports us,
I work in the shop,

821
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:51,974
do the housework, raise the kids,
clean, cook, like normal.

822
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:56,437
And as God is my witness,
he never raised a hand to me.

823
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,731
Never raised a hand to her.

824
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:02,109
Did you ever refuse Simon a request?

825
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,738
What do you mean?
I do what I have to do.

826
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,826
Mrs. Abecassis,

827
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,411
do you have
your own bank account?

828
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:19,585
No.

829
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,922
Did you ever want
your own bank account?

830
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,467
What does she need
a bank account for?

831
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,094
She has everything she needs.

832
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:29,971
Good.

833
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:31,639
Mrs. Abecassis,

834
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,267
how many children did you want?

835
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,103
Four, like normal.

836
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,188
And you have three daughters.

837
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:43,025
They're perfect,
may God protect them.

838
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,779
Can you tell us
why you had six miscarriages

839
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,031
after you had your three daughters?

840
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,409
Your Honor, what is he driving at?

841
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,035
Shimon, be quiet, please.

842
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,246
Answer, Mrs. Abecassis.

843
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,666
We wanted more kids.

844
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,418
You did or your husband did?

845
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,463
What do you mean?
I was pregnant.

846
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,883
You have three healthy daughters,

847
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,844
and you keep getting pregnant

848
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:13,431
despite the miscarriages
that put your life at risk.

849
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,148
Are you afraid of your husband,

850
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,734
Mrs. Abecassis?

851
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,321
She isn't afraid.

852
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:30,990
You're afraid?

853
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,117
Tell him.

854
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,078
Tell him!

855
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:41,751
She's not afraid.

856
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,336
I'm not afraid.

857
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,464
- I give him the respect he deserves.
- Respect?

858
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,550
You wanted sons.

859
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,844
Your husband wanted a son.

860
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,805
Dona, let's go.

861
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:01,187
Mrs. Abecassis,
there's an Earthly court

862
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:02,730
and a Heavenly court.

863
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,273
He's intimidating her.

864
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:08,027
I'm not intimidating her,
I'm stating a fact.

865
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,738
It's her husband who intimidates her.

866
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:20,081
Madam, are you afraid
to speak your mind?

867
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,003
I'm not afraid.

868
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,630
Then tell us why

869
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:31,550
Elisha lets Viviane go out,
and go on vacation alone?

870
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,720
Look, sir,

871
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,723
Elisha doesn't like those things.

872
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:41,435
And he doesn't want to say no,
so he lets her.

873
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:42,478
Liberal.

874
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,021
Liberal?

875
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,607
He doesn't have to like it.

876
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,318
I want you to come home.

877
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,405
I'm begging you, come home.

878
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:53,823
No, Simon.

879
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,453
Let me speak.

880
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:03,582
It's hard for a woman to be alone,

881
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:07,503
when everyone else has a partner.

882
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,755
Elisha,

883
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,007
forgive me.

884
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,550
I'm sorry.

885
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,928
I told you:
what was she supposed to say?

886
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,555
You went away,

887
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,475
you were at work,
you have errands to do.

888
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,769
She didn't want to lie.

889
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,147
So she didn't go out a lot.

890
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:31,652
But for the kids' sake,
so they'd feel like everyone else,

891
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,990
she took them out.
Should she have stayed home?

892
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,492
Normal...

893
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,328
So what are you saying?

894
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:45,166
Who is the perfect husband, Dona?

895
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,252
Simon or Elisha?

896
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,046
I'm leaving.

897
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,464
Wait, Simon.

898
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:55,676
He wants her to shame her husband
in public?

899
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,053
Carmel, I'm warning you!

900
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,055
Your Honor, I apologize.

901
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,850
I don't need an answer.

902
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:03,976
Excuse me.

903
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,856
Mrs. Abecassis, think carefully.

904
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,691
It's 8:00, your husband is asleep,

905
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:14,820
and you, after working all day,
you are awake.

906
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:15,780
Cooking.

907
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,698
Cooking, into the night.

908
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,618
Did you ever hear
the Amsalems fight?

909
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:21,786
Once in a while.

910
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,288
What do you do
when you hear them?

911
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:27,374
I wait a little and then I go in.

912
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,293
You wait and then go in.

913
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:30,878
That's what I said.

914
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:32,713
That's what you do.

915
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,381
You want to drive me crazy?
Yes!

916
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,509
That's what you're used to doing?

917
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,928
Leave me alone! Yes!

918
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,430
It's a habit, Your Honor.

919
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:42,807
Fine.

920
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,183
Why do you wait?

921
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,979
I wait to see if it'll blow over.

922
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,148
I wait to see if I have to go in.

923
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:54,610
- Why would you have to go in?
- I don't have to, but it's better.

924
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,363
Anyway,
one of the kids comes to get me.

925
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,534
Dona, I'm warning you,
why do you have to go in?

926
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,579
They shout,

927
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:08,082
it's frightening.

928
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,001
How often do you have to go in?

929
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:14,505
As I said, once in a while,
when it's necessary.

930
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:18,008
What's "once in a while"?
Once a year? Once a month?

931
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:20,261
Once every week or two.

932
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:22,263
What does he want from me,
Your Honor?

933
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:26,183
Once every week or two
you go in and see Viviane crying,

934
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:27,476
screaming,

935
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:30,563
and Elisha doesn't
raise his voice, right?

936
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:34,650
He doesn't raise his voice.
He's gracious.

937
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,528
Why do you think she cries?

938
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:41,240
I don't know.
Everyone has their needs.

939
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,034
What do you see when you go in?

940
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,960
Viviane's crying.

941
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,382
Then she throws something.

942
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,383
And he?

943
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,845
He closes the windows.
That's normal.

944
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:07,516
It's normal that she screams
and he runs to close the windows?

945
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:10,436
Do you want everyone
to hear them screaming?

946
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,105
What does he do
that makes her cry?

947
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,121
Mrs. Abecassis,

948
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,498
does she cry for no reason?

949
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,843
I told her...

950
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,764
A smart woman...

951
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:52,269
should know when to keep
her mouth shut.

952
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,480
What do they want?

953
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,232
Respect, that's all.

954
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:00,986
He's a liberal man,

955
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:05,783
and then she can do
whatever she wants.

956
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:10,496
Viviane, I told you.

957
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,249
Nothing but respect.

958
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:18,837
Respect, that's all.

959
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:23,050
Then you can do
whatever you want.

960
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,781
Mrs. Abecassis,

961
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:49,952
Viviane...

962
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,454
She speaks to you?

963
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,373
Yes,

964
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:56,792
mostly about the home.

965
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,546
Do you know if the couple
has friends?

966
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:02,715
Friends?

967
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:03,966
Yes, friends.

968
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,094
Answer the question, madam.

969
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,139
I don't really know.

970
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,143
No, Your Honor.

971
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,438
We have no friends.

972
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:21,191
We don't go anywhere with anyone
and no one ever comes over.

973
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,443
That's a lie.

974
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,945
Ask him if we have friends.

975
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,364
- Mr. Amsalem, do you have friends?
- Yes, Your Honor.

976
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,576
Ask him who, please.
Just one name.

977
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:33,871
The only people who tolerate him

978
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,622
are Victor and Yvette

979
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,584
who refused to testify
out of respect for him.

980
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:40,669
All lies.

981
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,464
I want to hear only the couple.

982
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,966
Everyone else, out.

983
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:47,676
Thank you, Mrs. Abecassis.

984
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,429
Rabbi Shimon, please go out.

985
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,516
Thank you, Carmel.

986
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:58,228
Close the door, please.

987
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:00,731
Your Honor...

988
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,192
I make concessions.

989
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,319
I even let her go out on the Sabbath.

990
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:09,114
The kids watch TV, turn on the lights,
don't come to synagogue.

991
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:12,284
He makes many concessions
on the Sabbath.

992
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:14,411
Is that true, Mrs. Amsalem?

993
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,330
Yes.
What does it matter?

994
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,123
All the witnesses say so.

995
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,626
That's how she was raised,
Your Honor.

996
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:22,628
You ingrate.

997
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:24,296
You have no shame?

998
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,631
He has no shame.

999
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,550
I always prepare
a big Sabbath dinner,

1000
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,511
I make the kids stay home.

1001
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,721
I start preparing on Wednesday.

1002
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,432
And I'm making meatballs,
fish, salads.

1003
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,143
Do you cook?
Tell the truth, do you cook?

1004
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:39,561
Thankless.

1005
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:40,521
Ingrate.

1006
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:42,314
Here we go again.

1007
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,401
That's right, here we go again.

1008
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,446
He sneaks his words
in below his breath

1009
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,865
so no one can hear,
but I hear.

1010
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,283
He said nothing.

1011
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:55,119
Your Honor,
you can't talk to her.

1012
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,621
She attacks me
as I open my mouth.

1013
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:58,872
Don't start in.

1014
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:03,627
Don't you start in.
If you want to talk to me, come home.

1015
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:06,755
No, I'm never coming home again.
It's over.

1016
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,257
I did,

1017
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,551
as I was asked, so what?

1018
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:14,012
I slept with him in the same bed
and nothing happened.

1019
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:17,599
The whole time I was home
he didn't say a word to me.

1020
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:21,145
He was happy for his victory,
and still he kept sulking.

1021
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,354
That's a lie.

1022
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,273
I spoke to her a thousand times.

1023
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,899
- You spoke to me?
- Yes, I spoke to you.

1024
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:29,570
I was sick and he didn't even
bring me a cup of tea!

1025
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:32,531
- He slept in the living room!
- A tea for Elijah the Prophet!

1026
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,868
I don't want to talk to him,
that's my right.

1027
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,995
- Your Honor...
- Yes, let him write this down.

1028
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:42,207
Never a kind word to say...
But I'm not here to argue with him.

1029
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,418
I have enough of that at home.
Enough!

1030
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:47,087
No, Viviane.
What's over?

1031
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,172
What?

1032
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:49,798
Never, Viviane!

1033
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:52,801
Your Honor...

1034
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:56,430
if she doesn't apologize
for everything she's done

1035
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,182
I'll never give her a divorce.

1036
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,766
Your Honor, I'm warning him,

1037
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:03,312
I'm warning him
and you're all my witnesses,

1038
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:07,483
if he doesn't meet me halfway
I'll do what I please.

1039
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,151
I'm not scared.

1040
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,446
I've been kept
like a dog in a yard,

1041
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,656
but not for long.

1042
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:17,284
I'll rent an apartment
and start to live...

1043
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:18,577
Show respect.

1044
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,455
He'll come begging for a divorce.

1045
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,332
And he'll never find me.

1046
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,586
He'll regret this day, you'll see.

1047
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:31,798
I already regret all the years
I've lived with her,

1048
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:33,258
it's a failure.

1049
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,386
She shames herself, the children.

1050
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,889
What does she have to gain
from all this?

1051
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,933
It's you who will lose.

1052
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:44,144
We'll see who loses.

1053
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,355
We'll see.

1054
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,482
You want to keep me by force?

1055
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,108
Try.

1056
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:56,657
TWO WEEKS LATER

1057
00:58:57,158 --> 00:59:01,245
You're here to testify
on behalf of your friend Elisha?

1058
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:02,204
Yes, Your Honor.

1059
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:05,374
What is your relationship
to both parties?

1060
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:09,920
The defendant has been a good friend
for many years.

1061
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,632
He brings great joy
to the congregation.

1062
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:16,051
And the plaintiff is...

1063
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:17,636
well-known.

1064
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:18,470
Well-known?

1065
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:23,809
I mean known for her beauty
and elegance.

1066
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,978
A professional hairdresser.

1067
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:27,604
Rabbi Shimon, if you please.

1068
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,439
Thank you, Your Honor.

1069
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:34,736
Mr. Jacob Ben Harouch,
you've known Elisha for many years.

1070
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:39,366
Do you know of any incident
that would attest

1071
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,451
to a flaw in his character?

1072
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,580
As I said, he's a saint.

1073
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,708
Never imposed himself
on anyone?

1074
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,918
No. Always gracious.

1075
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,044
Always.

1076
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,047
- Well-liked?
- Very.

1077
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:56,258
There's gossip in the synagogue, no?

1078
00:59:56,676 --> 01:00:01,388
Thou shall not gossip,
or however the saying goes...

1079
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,724
So you happen to hear:

1080
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:07,102
"This one went here,
that one went there..."

1081
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,856
I know what everyone else knows,
no more, no less.

1082
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:14,818
Everyone sees the sun, right?

1083
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,069
It's like that.

1084
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:18,280
And among all the rumors...

1085
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,240
unwillingly, of course,

1086
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:24,411
did you ever hear anything

1087
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:28,373
about my brother Elisha Amsalem
or his home?

1088
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,625
Nothing, never.

1089
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:33,086
And even if something happened,
we never heard about it.

1090
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:36,173
So if you don't hear,
it never happened.

1091
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,176
- Everyone sees the moonlight.
- True.

1092
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,599
If you had a daughter,

1093
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:48,685
would you let your daughter
marry him?

1094
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,062
Without hesitation.

1095
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:57,819
Sunlight, moonlight,
interesting.

1096
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:03,450
Jacob Ben Harouch, could it be
that the sunlight has blinded you?

1097
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:04,618
What do you want, Carmel?

1098
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:08,080
Didn't you hear
that Elisha Amsalem lives alone

1099
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:12,668
and that his "well-known" wife
moved out four years ago?

1100
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:17,130
- For two and a half years, we didn't.
- How can that be?

1101
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,216
- Elisha didn't tell us.
- And then he did?

1102
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,300
- No.
- Then what?

1103
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:23,136
- People talked.
- What did they say?

1104
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:26,098
They said she left him because
they aren't compatible.

1105
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:27,974
That's what they said.

1106
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:29,184
What else?

1107
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,311
They said he let her go

1108
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,730
and now he's waiting

1109
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:35,774
for her to calm down.

1110
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:38,276
He never said no to her. Never.

1111
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:40,987
Domestic harmony
is all that matters to him.

1112
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,490
You've been praying together
for a long time?

1113
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:44,616
Yes.

1114
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:47,661
Did you ever have to mediate
between Elisha and anyone?

1115
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:50,539
Mediate?

1116
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,667
What do you mean, mediate?

1117
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,336
What it sounds like. Mediate.

1118
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,964
Mediate? Yes.

1119
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:00,966
Go on.

1120
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,677
Look...

1121
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:06,805
Elisha, how should I put it?

1122
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,182
He's pedantic.

1123
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,644
He likes things done his way.

1124
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:18,024
When you say "pedantic,"
you mean "stubborn."

1125
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:20,110
Your Honor, he's interpreting!

1126
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,946
Did you hear me say stubborn?

1127
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,531
I said "pedantic."

1128
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:27,117
Okay. Give us an example.

1129
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,704
If a congregant doesn't
follow his advice,

1130
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:32,539
or sings differently,

1131
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,791
Elisha...

1132
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,295
doesn't spare the rod.

1133
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,715
I suppose not all the congregants
sing like him

1134
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:45,093
so you've had to mediate
between Elisha and...

1135
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,220
two, three congregants.

1136
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:49,765
It's a synagogue,
that's how it goes.

1137
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:52,559
Everyone has someone
he doesn't speak with.

1138
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:53,935
So does he.

1139
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:57,189
They don't speak.
What's the big deal?

1140
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:58,440
So what?

1141
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,944
Can you give us a name?

1142
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:05,071
A name?

1143
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:10,994
A name, please.

1144
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:15,040
Give us a name.

1145
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:18,502
Abraham Zagouri.

1146
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,295
Zagouri.

1147
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:24,549
They had a disagreement
and since then they aren't speaking?

1148
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:25,634
Yes.

1149
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,302
For how long?

1150
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,346
It's not my business.

1151
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:32,182
Isn't it your job
as the Synagogue manager

1152
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,267
to conciliate the congregants?

1153
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:35,685
Of course it is.

1154
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:37,604
Try to remember.

1155
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,065
- How long haven't they spoken?
- A while.

1156
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,066
How long?

1157
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:41,942
A long time.

1158
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:43,527
- How long?
- Many years.

1159
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:45,946
- How many years?
- 15 years. Okay?

1160
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:46,905
Excellent.

1161
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:50,116
For 15 years,
they haven't spoken

1162
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:52,577
because of a prayer
sung out of tune.

1163
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:55,163
Why nitpick?

1164
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:59,125
Elisha talked, the other did too,
and no one has forgiven.

1165
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:00,585
Is that a crime? No.

1166
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:02,170
It's not a crime.

1167
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,173
Did you try to mend the rift?

1168
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,592
- How many times?
- Plenty of times.

1169
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:09,135
How many?

1170
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,931
I don't know, on holidays...

1171
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,517
Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah.

1172
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:19,145
Abraham Zagouri apologized
to Elisha Amsalem.

1173
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:20,313
Yes.

1174
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:21,898
How many times?

1175
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,111
Several times.

1176
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:27,279
How many?

1177
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:32,117
Until he gave up.

1178
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,453
And he didn't forgive him. Did he?

1179
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:43,712
He didn't.

1180
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,047
So what if my brother doesn't
speak to a congregant?

1181
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,551
That's not the point, Shimon.

1182
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,263
The point is his endless patience.
He's made us wait five years!

1183
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,640
And he could make us
wait even longer.

1184
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:57,726
15 years, Your Honors.

1185
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:58,810
15 years!

1186
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:00,312
No more questions.

1187
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,355
- So what?
- So nothing.

1188
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:03,815
The witness is dismissed.

1189
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,111
The witness may leave.

1190
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,830
ONE WEEK LATER

1191
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,499
Thanks for coming.
Your testimony means a lot

1192
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:25,337
- because you know all the congregants.
- For 20 years.

1193
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:28,715
I heard what Mr. Ben Harouch said.
Nonsense.

1194
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:33,261
Zagouri doesn't speak
to half the synagogue. Really.

1195
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:34,721
Good to know.

1196
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:39,059
Elisha is one of the best congregants
in our synagogue.

1197
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:42,354
He's humble. Special.
A true friend.

1198
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:45,440
That's all, Your Honor.

1199
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:48,860
Your Honor, if I may.

1200
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:50,904
So...

1201
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:54,950
- Zagouri is the problem, not Elisha.
- Not Elisha!

1202
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:58,954
Zagouri is ignorant,
he comes to synagogue twice a year,

1203
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,330
and wants to teach us

1204
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:02,666
how to sing a verse!

1205
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:06,336
A guest doesn't tell his hostess
how to cook her stew.

1206
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:08,254
The problem isn't him, it's her.

1207
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:10,382
Her?

1208
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:13,885
No.

1209
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,554
What?

1210
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:18,807
Yes.

1211
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:22,102
I think...

1212
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,271
If I may...

1213
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,482
this woman is deceitful.

1214
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:29,651
Excuse me?

1215
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:31,528
Sit down, Mrs. Amsalem.

1216
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:34,406
Why do you say she's deceitful?

1217
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:38,994
Your Honor,
I work in the mall.

1218
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,370
So what?

1219
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:41,663
Just a minute!

1220
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:46,626
Across from my store,
there's the Kapulsky Café.

1221
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:47,544
Yes.

1222
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:50,171
And I saw this woman

1223
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:52,298
with a strange man

1224
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,175
at the Kapulsky Café.

1225
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,177
He's lying, Your Honor!

1226
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:57,804
Silence, Mr. Amsalem.

1227
01:06:58,472 --> 01:06:59,973
Maybe it was a relative?

1228
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:03,059
No, it's a big, respectable family.

1229
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:04,811
I know them all.

1230
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:06,604
He wasn't a relative.

1231
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:10,275
Maybe someone
from the extended family?

1232
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,280
He didn't look like a relative.

1233
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:19,784
- Did you see them holding hands?
- No.

1234
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:22,579
- Did they touch each other?
- No, Your Honor.

1235
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,914
It's all lies.

1236
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:28,877
Elisha, people talk.
I'm just trying to help you.

1237
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,336
Help me?

1238
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:32,881
Elisha, hold on.

1239
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,717
Shmuel, are you absolutely sure

1240
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:38,595
that the woman you saw
was Viviane Amsalem?

1241
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:50,023
I could never mistake her.

1242
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:51,858
Viviane Amsalem,

1243
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:55,278
is this man, Shmuel Azoulay,
speaking the truth?

1244
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:57,447
Yes, Your Honor.

1245
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:02,368
- Did you commit adultery?
- No.

1246
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,330
Your Honor,
my client isn't an adulteress.

1247
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:08,917
Idiot!

1248
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,170
Watch yourself, Mrs. Amsalem,
I heard that.

1249
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,256
Know your place, woman.

1250
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:19,010
I know my place, Your Honor.

1251
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:23,181
In the Kapulsky Café is where
I met with my advocate,

1252
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,349
Carmel Ben Tovim.

1253
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:27,685
- In the Café?
- Yes.

1254
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:29,145
Didn't you hear that?

1255
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,983
Carmel Ben Tovim, do you confirm?

1256
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,239
Yes, Your Honor.

1257
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:43,868
Why were you sitting in a café
with this woman?

1258
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:49,290
Your Honor,
my office is on Mt. Carmel,

1259
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:53,211
and since I have a number
of clients in the suburbs

1260
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,588
on Thursdays I meet them

1261
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:57,757
at the Kapulsky Café,

1262
01:08:58,175 --> 01:08:59,467
so as...

1263
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:03,346
to make it easier for them.

1264
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:05,515
We have short meetings.

1265
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:07,517
Dubious.

1266
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:10,103
Is something wrong?

1267
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,314
A public place, total visibility.

1268
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:16,151
The café owners will confirm.

1269
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:17,777
Shmuel Azoulay,

1270
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:20,822
do you recognize
Mr. Carmel Ben Tovim

1271
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,908
as the man you saw sitting
with Mrs. Viviane Amsalem

1272
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:25,785
at the café in the mall?

1273
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:35,712
I'm not sure, Your Honor.

1274
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,631
The man was wearing a skullcap.

1275
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:42,343
The day I had an appointment
with Mrs. Amsalem,

1276
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:45,013
I came from a funeral and forgot
to take the skullcap off my head.

1277
01:09:46,056 --> 01:09:47,265
I forgot about it.

1278
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,100
You forgot.

1279
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:52,353
Is there a problem?

1280
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:59,360
The son of Sasson Ben Tovim,
the light unto the nations,

1281
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,696
forgot to remove his skullcap?

1282
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:03,990
Out of excitement...

1283
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:05,283
I beg your pardon?

1284
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:07,327
You're pardoned.

1285
01:10:07,494 --> 01:10:09,204
I don't need it, Shimon.

1286
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:14,083
A man who wrote half a ruling,
thinks of himself as a great Rabbi!

1287
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:17,045
This isn't the place
to insult Rabbi Shimon.

1288
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:21,007
Rabbi Shimon's rulings were
dismissed by Rabbi Abouhatsira.

1289
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,552
Shimon Amsalem
is a student, not a rabbi.

1290
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:29,224
I never claimed to be one.

1291
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:32,268
I never asked
to be called "Rabbi."

1292
01:10:33,103 --> 01:10:35,021
I know my place

1293
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,774
and trust in God
and Him alone.

1294
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:40,777
And thank Him every day
for what He's given me.

1295
01:10:47,534 --> 01:10:49,535
What are you doing, Mrs. Amsalem?

1296
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:04,759
What are you doing, Mrs. Amsalem?

1297
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:06,928
Pull your hair back!

1298
01:13:00,584 --> 01:13:05,671
ONE MONTH LATER - THREE YEARS
SINCE THE TRIAL BEGAN

1299
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:08,216
Elisha,

1300
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:12,970
did you let friends
come over or not?

1301
01:13:13,138 --> 01:13:16,182
Very few came over.
Not often, I admit it.

1302
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:18,184
I didn't want it.

1303
01:13:19,853 --> 01:13:21,437
Why not?

1304
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:23,147
Your Honor...

1305
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:27,068
I'm a man whose privacy
and modesty are important to him.

1306
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:30,321
Just like my parents,
may they rest in peace.

1307
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:31,322
But she...

1308
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:34,367
She tells her friends
and siblings everything.

1309
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:37,370
And they came over.
That's normal.

1310
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:41,791
- Why did they come over?
- To reconcile between us.

1311
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:43,418
It was intolerable.

1312
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:47,171
They came over so often
I started to detest them.

1313
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:50,174
Every time they came over
I had to defend myself.

1314
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:52,218
They were all on her side.

1315
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:53,928
How could we be friends?

1316
01:13:55,889 --> 01:13:58,808
They never took my side.

1317
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:03,521
I'm not like her,
I can't express my feelings.

1318
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,106
Your Honor...

1319
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,859
I was orphaned
of a father all my life.

1320
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:12,488
- And the children?
- Always on her side.

1321
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:15,658
They saw their mother fall apart

1322
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:19,036
and their father standing there,
motionless, speechless.

1323
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,789
What were they to think?

1324
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:24,417
Children always take
the mother's side, it's normal.

1325
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:30,006
I didn't abandon my mother either.

1326
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:32,592
I was with her to the day she died.

1327
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:36,929
No one took care of her.
None of my brothers helped me.

1328
01:14:37,097 --> 01:14:37,763
Thank God,

1329
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:40,475
they each had
their own wives and children.

1330
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:41,642
And I...

1331
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:43,352
was with my mother.

1332
01:14:50,694 --> 01:14:52,570
You couldn't talk to each other?

1333
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:54,572
You can't talk to her.

1334
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,532
All she does is scream.

1335
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:03,289
I feel sorry for you, my brother.

1336
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:07,168
I'm sorry we didn't see you.

1337
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:14,550
Elisha,

1338
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:17,929
does this woman respect you?

1339
01:15:19,806 --> 01:15:21,057
No, my brother.

1340
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:25,311
Then why do you want her back?

1341
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:28,314
She's my destiny and I'm hers.

1342
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:30,358
We will never part.

1343
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:33,110
And that's that?

1344
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:43,663
I love her.
I've always loved her.

1345
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:58,344
That's all.

1346
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:10,273
Orphaned of a father.

1347
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:13,985
It's sad.

1348
01:16:15,028 --> 01:16:17,738
But now you're a husband and a father.

1349
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:18,990
True.

1350
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:24,412
You said she never compromises.

1351
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:28,541
Your mother lived with you
for over 20 years!

1352
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:31,127
I was always grateful for that.

1353
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:32,878
How did you show it?

1354
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:41,387
And how, Elisha,

1355
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,890
how can you mend the relationship?

1356
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:51,856
This woman...

1357
01:16:53,233 --> 01:16:54,233
doesn't want you.

1358
01:16:55,485 --> 01:16:56,902
She doesn't love you anymore.

1359
01:16:57,821 --> 01:17:00,114
Isn't that reason enough
to let her go?

1360
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:02,450
Can you really live with someone
who doesn't love you?

1361
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:04,952
Not to say, is sick of you?

1362
01:17:12,919 --> 01:17:15,379
One more question,
Elisha Amsalem.

1363
01:17:15,839 --> 01:17:18,799
Have you tried
to meet your wife halfway?

1364
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:20,926
To give her what she asks for?

1365
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:22,345
Like what?

1366
01:17:22,512 --> 01:17:25,640
When did you last
take her to a café?

1367
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:29,185
A café?
It's not kosher.

1368
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:32,021
You could pack sandwiches

1369
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:35,358
and take her to the beach.
You live by the sea, no?

1370
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:36,609
Right.

1371
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:38,653
So?

1372
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:42,990
I never thought of that, I admit.

1373
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:48,454
Movies are kosher.
And I hear you love cinema.

1374
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:52,333
I love cinema,

1375
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,752
I know all the stars

1376
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,712
from Charles Bronson to...

1377
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:01,467
Gregory Peck.

1378
01:18:02,594 --> 01:18:05,012
But now there's a problem
with indecency.

1379
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,180
Indecency, Your Honor.

1380
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:09,225
They show things I don't want to see.

1381
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:13,312
It didn't use to be that way.

1382
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:17,274
A flower... When did you last
come home with flowers and say:

1383
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:19,860
"Viviane, these are for you"?

1384
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:23,364
When did you last tell her:
"Viviane, I love you"?

1385
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,660
Begging the court's pardon,
I must ask a question,

1386
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:31,372
perhaps I'll finally find grounds
for divorce.

1387
01:18:32,749 --> 01:18:35,334
When did you last have relations?

1388
01:18:37,921 --> 01:18:39,004
When?

1389
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:52,518
She doesn't want to.

1390
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:56,897
I see.

1391
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:01,652
No more questions.

1392
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:06,031
Thank you, Elisha Amsalem.

1393
01:19:06,533 --> 01:19:10,995
Mrs. Viviane Amsalem,
please take the stand.

1394
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:24,759
Your Honor, may I?

1395
01:19:32,809 --> 01:19:34,143
Viviane Amsalem.

1396
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,938
Yes, Shimon?

1397
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:39,440
Do you love my brother?

1398
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:46,989
Have you tried to understand him
and his needs?

1399
01:19:49,075 --> 01:19:49,992
Yes.

1400
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:53,412
Did you ever give
the relationship a chance?

1401
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:57,666
I tried every possible way.

1402
01:19:57,834 --> 01:20:01,712
Why, then, did you insist
on putting my brother in situations

1403
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,715
where you knew he couldn't deliver?

1404
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:07,468
Why did you embarrass him
time after time

1405
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:10,387
in front of friends and family?

1406
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:14,141
He's ignored me and my needs
all my life.

1407
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,560
He acts as if I was thin air.

1408
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:19,188
Have you turned
your children against him?

1409
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:22,691
And told them what transpired
between you?

1410
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:24,610
He didn't spare them either.

1411
01:20:24,778 --> 01:20:27,738
He'd bring them into the room
to talk behind closed doors.

1412
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:30,407
You shamed him
in front of the neighbors.

1413
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:35,704
You screamed and swore at him.
You beat him in front of strangers.

1414
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:37,581
Why?

1415
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,042
That's not how it was.

1416
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,044
You didn't beat him?

1417
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:46,340
You didn't break dishes,
throw things at him?

1418
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:48,384
I had outbursts.

1419
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:50,261
Yes.

1420
01:20:53,306 --> 01:20:55,766
It's easy to blame
the one who yells.

1421
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:58,561
The one who whispers venom
is innocent.

1422
01:20:58,728 --> 01:21:01,146
He went to hell and back
with you

1423
01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:04,108
and now you want to shame him?

1424
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:06,652
To rub his failure in his face?

1425
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:11,365
You always wanted
your marriage to fail

1426
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:14,743
and your husband was loyal
and despite your actions

1427
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:17,580
he protected you and your children.

1428
01:21:17,747 --> 01:21:20,082
Why must you harm him
again and again?

1429
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:23,836
What did Elisha Amsalem ever do
but make you happy?

1430
01:21:25,005 --> 01:21:28,257
If I were happy,
would I want to go?

1431
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:32,720
Don't you think
I'd rather grow old peacefully?

1432
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:36,390
With my children?
Surrounded by my family?

1433
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:38,225
Did you know, Viviane,

1434
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:41,353
that my brother could be rid of you
because you refuse to abide

1435
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:43,731
by the be fruitful and multiply
commandment?

1436
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:47,026
Let him do it!
I gave him four children.

1437
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:49,653
And he was a good father
to your children.

1438
01:21:50,196 --> 01:21:52,656
Yes.
And supported you.

1439
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:54,617
Yes.

1440
01:21:54,784 --> 01:21:56,785
Yes, he supported you!

1441
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:01,498
- And never raised a hand to you!
- No.

1442
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,585
Viviane Amsalem,

1443
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:08,339
you are a wayward woman.

1444
01:22:08,673 --> 01:22:10,382
- Your Honor...
- Calm down, Shimon.

1445
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:13,719
You exploited him all your life.
He provided you with a home,

1446
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:17,389
family, children, security, honor

1447
01:22:17,557 --> 01:22:19,183
and a good name!

1448
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:21,644
And now you want
to throw all that away?

1449
01:22:24,981 --> 01:22:25,856
Your Honor,

1450
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:28,817
I don't want to live with this man.

1451
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:30,527
It's my right.

1452
01:22:31,529 --> 01:22:34,531
It's your right,
but it's not your choice.

1453
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:35,491
- Yes.
- No.

1454
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:38,118
- Yes.
- No, it's not up to you.

1455
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:41,914
If we were dealing with a man
who beats his wife,

1456
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:44,875
who refused her pleasure,
clothes or food,

1457
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:47,086
then we'd have
something to discuss,

1458
01:22:47,253 --> 01:22:49,505
but before you stands a woman

1459
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:51,382
whose wishes are irrational.

1460
01:22:51,549 --> 01:22:55,386
A woman who beats her husband,
embarrasses him, refuses his needs,

1461
01:22:55,553 --> 01:22:57,137
and he still wants her back!

1462
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:01,892
And you want to force this man
to grant her a divorce?

1463
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:05,187
If that's how it is,
my duty in this court is over.

1464
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:08,691
What else can I say?
You're right, I'm crazy.

1465
01:23:12,028 --> 01:23:13,654
No more questions.

1466
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:30,671
It's a shame that Shimon chose
to ramble on

1467
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,506
instead of listening.

1468
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:34,967
Watch your tongue,
Carmel Ben Tovim!

1469
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:37,928
Ignoring my client's answers,
time and again.

1470
01:23:38,596 --> 01:23:41,265
I know how to talk, too, Shimon.

1471
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:48,480
How long have you thought
about leaving this man?

1472
01:23:50,775 --> 01:23:53,152
Seriously, about 10 years.

1473
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:56,113
- For 10 years he's ignored your wishes.
- Yes.

1474
01:23:58,408 --> 01:23:59,783
And not seriously?

1475
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,871
From the day we married,

1476
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:05,122
my whole life.

1477
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:08,500
Why did you marry?

1478
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:14,048
Why?

1479
01:24:16,634 --> 01:24:17,676
Because.

1480
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:21,096
That's life.
We got married.

1481
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:27,728
Viviane, why did you stay with him?

1482
01:24:28,104 --> 01:24:30,272
I didn't want to break up the family.

1483
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:36,779
Have you been a good wife?

1484
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:40,657
Make her answer!

1485
01:24:40,825 --> 01:24:42,076
Sit!

1486
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:43,619
Answer, madam.

1487
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:52,086
I don't think
I've been a good wife to him.

1488
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:55,255
I wanted things
he couldn't give me.

1489
01:24:59,135 --> 01:25:00,135
Did you love him?

1490
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:02,679
Yes.

1491
01:25:03,056 --> 01:25:04,807
I wanted us to be happy.

1492
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:10,479
Viviane Amsalem,

1493
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:12,898
how long has your husband

1494
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:15,150
not come to you?

1495
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:21,949
A long time.

1496
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,575
How long?

1497
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:30,374
A long time.

1498
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:31,917
How long?

1499
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:35,921
How long is a long time?

1500
01:25:41,052 --> 01:25:42,469
You wanted and he refused?

1501
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:48,475
Viviane, I'm asking,

1502
01:25:49,018 --> 01:25:51,019
did you want it and he refused?

1503
01:25:54,858 --> 01:25:57,109
A long time, Carmel.

1504
01:25:57,277 --> 01:25:58,986
We haven't had relations
in many years.

1505
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:05,200
No more questions, Your Honor.

1506
01:26:06,369 --> 01:26:08,245
Your Honors, if I may.

1507
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:10,455
No relations for a long time?

1508
01:26:10,623 --> 01:26:13,750
- He says you don't want to.
- He can say whatever he wants.

1509
01:26:13,918 --> 01:26:15,711
Interesting.

1510
01:26:16,296 --> 01:26:19,131
- And when he wanted it, did you agree?
- No.

1511
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:20,549
There you have it!

1512
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:23,427
She didn't want to.
You admit it?

1513
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:26,054
Still, you have four children.

1514
01:26:26,389 --> 01:26:28,390
Explain! We want to understand.

1515
01:26:29,642 --> 01:26:30,893
Speak up, Mrs. Amsalem.

1516
01:26:33,271 --> 01:26:35,314
- Answer, madam.
- What should I say?

1517
01:26:35,481 --> 01:26:38,358
How we had four children?
Nothing to tell.

1518
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:39,943
Your Honor, we have grounds.

1519
01:26:40,111 --> 01:26:40,944
She's lying.

1520
01:26:41,112 --> 01:26:43,197
It's her word against his.

1521
01:26:45,074 --> 01:26:46,575
Want the truth, Shimon?

1522
01:26:46,951 --> 01:26:48,952
I'll tell you, if you insist.

1523
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,078
Yes, my sister.

1524
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:54,374
Don't call me your sister
and then curse me.

1525
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:55,792
Enough hypocrisy!

1526
01:26:58,421 --> 01:27:01,215
Do you think I liked
living with your mother?

1527
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:03,550
No. I suffered.

1528
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:05,385
She made me suffer.

1529
01:27:05,553 --> 01:27:10,098
And I suffered when
he kept me away from my family,

1530
01:27:10,266 --> 01:27:12,643
and from my friends.
That he never said to me:

1531
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:15,938
"My wife, how are you?

1532
01:27:16,105 --> 01:27:20,442
Are you sad today? Are you happy?
How was your day?"

1533
01:27:22,403 --> 01:27:25,113
That he never touched me,

1534
01:27:25,865 --> 01:27:28,992
never held me,
neither at night nor in the day.

1535
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,495
Not in front of others, not at all.

1536
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:34,873
I respected him, Shimon,

1537
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:36,416
and you know it.

1538
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:39,795
But he was never satisfied. Never.

1539
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:43,340
Neither what I cooked
nor what I did.

1540
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:46,343
He'd come into the kitchen
and criticize.

1541
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:47,803
Always unhappy.

1542
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:50,639
He wouldn't eat what I cooked.

1543
01:27:51,849 --> 01:27:53,267
As if to punish me,

1544
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:54,977
to insult me.

1545
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:59,106
He always found a reason
to offend me, to ruin things.

1546
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:04,152
Your brother hates me, Shimon.

1547
01:28:05,363 --> 01:28:06,780
He hates me.

1548
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,284
He hates me, Your Honor.

1549
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:13,495
All he wants is
to see me unhappy.

1550
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:18,041
Until he sees me torn to pieces,
down on my knees,

1551
01:28:18,209 --> 01:28:19,710
he won't be satisfied.

1552
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:23,505
And even that won't be enough.

1553
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:52,951
What are you looking
at me for?

1554
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:03,628
You're in love with this woman.

1555
01:29:05,089 --> 01:29:08,050
You cannot hide your feelings.

1556
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:11,595
You're as clear as water.

1557
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:13,638
Your Honor,

1558
01:29:13,806 --> 01:29:17,059
I ask that you disqualify
Carmel Ben Tovim

1559
01:29:17,643 --> 01:29:19,895
since under the circumstances
he cannot serve as her advocate.

1560
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:21,313
I love this woman?!

1561
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:23,774
I don't love her,
she's just--

1562
01:29:23,941 --> 01:29:26,818
You don't love this woman?

1563
01:29:26,986 --> 01:29:27,778
No.

1564
01:29:27,945 --> 01:29:30,489
I don't love her
in the way you're implying.

1565
01:29:30,656 --> 01:29:32,491
Then how do you love her?

1566
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:34,409
How?
What are you saying?

1567
01:29:34,577 --> 01:29:36,912
Who said I love her?
Vivianne Amsalem is--

1568
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,747
Carmel Ben Tovim.

1569
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:41,541
Is it true that you love this woman?

1570
01:29:48,132 --> 01:29:49,466
This is turning into...

1571
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:52,969
You're all out of your minds.

1572
01:29:53,137 --> 01:29:57,599
Your Honor, I urge you,
put an end to this farce.

1573
01:29:57,975 --> 01:30:00,477
- I call you to order!
- Excuse me?

1574
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:03,522
You're abetting a denial of justice.

1575
01:30:03,689 --> 01:30:05,690
- Shut up.
- You aren't judging honestly.

1576
01:30:05,858 --> 01:30:09,820
- Shut up!
- You could have set her free long ago.

1577
01:30:09,987 --> 01:30:12,489
So she could bask in her delights?

1578
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:15,075
Carmel, is it true?

1579
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:18,453
Your Honor, I'm warning you,

1580
01:30:18,621 --> 01:30:21,039
you're dishonoring me.

1581
01:30:21,207 --> 01:30:23,667
You're risking the offense of slander.

1582
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:24,543
Shut up!

1583
01:30:25,002 --> 01:30:27,504
I'll sue this court!

1584
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:28,630
Shut up, I said.

1585
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:29,840
Rabbi Solomon,

1586
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:33,510
your judgment is biased.
You're a dishonest judge.

1587
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,178
Disqualify yourself...

1588
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:40,517
Your Honor, disqualify yourself!

1589
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:41,768
Shut up!

1590
01:30:55,658 --> 01:30:57,325
I've had enough.

1591
01:31:02,665 --> 01:31:04,458
Find yourselves another judge.

1592
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:38,825
THREE MONTHS LATER

1593
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:48,752
Rabbi Shimon,
is your brother going to appear?

1594
01:31:50,588 --> 01:31:52,756
I don't know, Your Honor.

1595
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:54,508
He said he'd come.

1596
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:58,094
My brother, unfortunately...

1597
01:31:58,262 --> 01:31:59,763
isn't talking to me.

1598
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:02,682
He isn't speaking with you?

1599
01:32:03,267 --> 01:32:06,394
How can you represent him
if he isn't talking to you?

1600
01:32:07,396 --> 01:32:11,149
He didn't ask me to quit
representing him, explicitly.

1601
01:32:12,318 --> 01:32:14,110
I'll say this once,

1602
01:32:14,278 --> 01:32:16,905
bring your brother,
or he'll go to jail.

1603
01:32:19,325 --> 01:32:20,867
Thank you, Your Honor.

1604
01:32:29,043 --> 01:32:32,420
TWO MONTHS LATER

1605
01:32:35,132 --> 01:32:38,718
Amsalems, please rise.

1606
01:32:53,192 --> 01:32:57,654
Elisha Amsalem,
did you enjoy jail?

1607
01:32:57,822 --> 01:33:00,323
- No, Your Honor.
- Of course not.

1608
01:33:00,491 --> 01:33:05,620
But since you missed three hearings,
you left me no choice.

1609
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:07,998
But here you are.

1610
01:33:08,165 --> 01:33:09,791
All's well that ends well,

1611
01:33:10,334 --> 01:33:11,668
and I'm glad.

1612
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:15,005
Where is your advocate,
Rabbi Shimon Amsalem?

1613
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:19,217
- I'll speak for myself.
- So be it.

1614
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:23,430
What we need to do today
is just a formality.

1615
01:33:23,889 --> 01:33:27,309
After much consideration
and in light of events,

1616
01:33:27,977 --> 01:33:31,521
it was decided by a majority
of three judges under my authority

1617
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:36,067
that you, Elisha Amsalem,
must grant this woman

1618
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:37,736
a divorce.

1619
01:33:44,201 --> 01:33:45,285
Thank you.

1620
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:46,661
Thank you, Your Honor.

1621
01:33:49,206 --> 01:33:51,207
I'll begin by asking:

1622
01:33:51,667 --> 01:33:53,168
Elisha Amsalem,

1623
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:56,880
are you, Viviane Amsalem's husband,

1624
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:58,923
after these many hearings,

1625
01:33:59,091 --> 01:34:03,094
and having been obligated
to do so by this court,

1626
01:34:03,262 --> 01:34:05,513
willing to grant this woman a divorce

1627
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:06,890
and repudiate her?

1628
01:34:09,935 --> 01:34:10,935
No, Your Honor.

1629
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:12,937
No? Elisha?

1630
01:34:13,981 --> 01:34:14,981
No.

1631
01:34:15,149 --> 01:34:16,483
People,

1632
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:18,610
I thought you made a decision!

1633
01:34:19,236 --> 01:34:21,905
So did I.
I ask to interrogate the defendant.

1634
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:23,156
Speak up!

1635
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:28,870
Elisha Amsalem,
is it true that we met,

1636
01:34:29,038 --> 01:34:33,208
you, your brother Shimon and me,
in prison?

1637
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:34,084
Yes.

1638
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:37,045
And what was said at that meeting?

1639
01:34:39,298 --> 01:34:44,052
Is it true that you stated
before me and your brother

1640
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:46,596
that if the court obliges you
to divorce, you will?

1641
01:34:46,764 --> 01:34:47,639
Yes.

1642
01:34:47,807 --> 01:34:50,266
- So what happened?
- I changed my mind.

1643
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:53,937
- He changed his mind, what do you say?
- What do you want me to say?

1644
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:56,314
My hands are tied.

1645
01:34:56,482 --> 01:35:00,694
I demand that the court sentence
the husband to six months in jail.

1646
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:02,779
Maimonides said:

1647
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:04,656
"Force him until he says: I wish it.

1648
01:35:04,824 --> 01:35:07,117
Lash him to his last breath."

1649
01:35:07,284 --> 01:35:08,368
People,

1650
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:10,745
this court has had enough of you.

1651
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:15,250
Come back with a solution
or don't come back at all, now get out.

1652
01:35:15,418 --> 01:35:17,168
No. Why?

1653
01:35:17,336 --> 01:35:18,253
Listen to me.

1654
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:21,464
This hearing is adjourned.

1655
01:35:21,841 --> 01:35:23,508
Notice will be sent by mail.

1656
01:35:23,926 --> 01:35:25,969
Why are you making me
run around in circles?

1657
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:28,847
Why, Your Honor?
Why?

1658
01:35:29,014 --> 01:35:31,474
Why have I come in and out
for years now

1659
01:35:31,642 --> 01:35:32,892
and nothing's changed?

1660
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:33,935
Why?

1661
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:37,480
You can't force him to divorce
nor to appear,

1662
01:35:37,648 --> 01:35:40,316
and you can't this or that,
and what about me?

1663
01:35:40,484 --> 01:35:42,819
When will you see me?

1664
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:46,197
When I'm too exhausted
to stand before you?

1665
01:35:46,657 --> 01:35:47,449
When?

1666
01:35:48,117 --> 01:35:51,327
If it were up to you,
it could go on for 10 years.

1667
01:35:51,495 --> 01:35:55,373
I could drop dead in front of you
and all you'd see was him!

1668
01:35:55,958 --> 01:35:58,543
But nobody is above the law.

1669
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:03,673
There's a God and there's justice
and He'll judge you as you judge me.

1670
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:05,925
Mercilessly.

1671
01:36:06,469 --> 01:36:08,636
You don't care about me!

1672
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:13,016
In America,
if a man doesn't show up twice in a row,

1673
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:14,100
it's over!

1674
01:36:14,268 --> 01:36:17,687
They divorce him,
whether he's there or not!

1675
01:36:17,855 --> 01:36:21,524
If he doesn't honor the law,
the law doesn't honor him!

1676
01:36:21,692 --> 01:36:24,569
And who do you honor?

1677
01:36:25,237 --> 01:36:28,239
For God's sake, have you no fear?

1678
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:31,159
So send me to hell.

1679
01:36:31,327 --> 01:36:33,369
Go to hell, too!

1680
01:36:33,662 --> 01:36:35,246
Enough!

1681
01:36:36,123 --> 01:36:37,290
Goddamn it!

1682
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:39,542
Enough!
This lady has finished.

1683
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:42,378
No, I haven't!

1684
01:36:42,546 --> 01:36:45,715
One day someone will take
the power from your hands.

1685
01:36:46,133 --> 01:36:49,385
What will you have left?
Conversions?

1686
01:36:49,678 --> 01:36:51,846
No one will want that either.

1687
01:36:52,014 --> 01:36:52,931
It's over.

1688
01:36:53,432 --> 01:36:56,559
Skullcaps on your heads?
Rabbinical court!

1689
01:36:56,977 --> 01:36:59,020
Shitty court!

1690
01:36:59,188 --> 01:36:59,979
Are you cursing?

1691
01:37:00,147 --> 01:37:02,732
Shitty job.
Shitty people!

1692
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:04,776
I suspend this woman from court

1693
01:37:04,944 --> 01:37:06,402
for 24 months.

1694
01:37:06,904 --> 01:37:09,906
- I'm the idiot!
- Disgrace and infamy.

1695
01:37:11,826 --> 01:37:14,911
A woman like her
should go back to her husband,

1696
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:17,080
if he's still willing!

1697
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:29,217
TWO MONTHS LATER

1698
01:37:42,898 --> 01:37:44,482
Speak up, Ben Tovim.

1699
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:48,403
Welcome back, Your Honor.

1700
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:52,657
We were worried about you.

1701
01:37:53,367 --> 01:37:54,617
For your well-being.

1702
01:37:55,452 --> 01:37:59,038
My client also sends her regards.

1703
01:37:59,206 --> 01:38:00,707
She's here?

1704
01:38:01,876 --> 01:38:04,711
She's outside... waiting.

1705
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:07,213
How can I help you?

1706
01:38:07,798 --> 01:38:09,299
See her.

1707
01:38:10,801 --> 01:38:12,010
Hear her.

1708
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:20,143
I can't.

1709
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:24,188
My colleague ruled,
and I must respect his ruling.

1710
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:29,986
- Your Honor...
- Final judgment, Carmel.

1711
01:38:30,404 --> 01:38:33,615
If you don't like it,
file an appeal.

1712
01:38:40,623 --> 01:38:44,667
FOUR MONTHS LATER

1713
01:38:54,970 --> 01:38:56,387
Appellants only.

1714
01:39:00,184 --> 01:39:00,934
Come in.

1715
01:39:01,101 --> 01:39:02,185
The advocates.

1716
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:08,358
Thank you for seeing me,
Your Honor.

1717
01:39:08,651 --> 01:39:14,697
I know that my client is still suspended
but there are new developments.

1718
01:39:14,865 --> 01:39:16,366
Speak up, Carmel.

1719
01:39:16,533 --> 01:39:19,410
The husband wants to grant a divorce.

1720
01:39:20,412 --> 01:39:22,956
Be merciful and see them.

1721
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:27,126
How do you know
this isn't another trick?

1722
01:39:27,294 --> 01:39:29,253
He approached us.

1723
01:39:29,421 --> 01:39:30,755
I understand.

1724
01:39:51,694 --> 01:39:54,195
The boys came over last night.

1725
01:39:54,363 --> 01:39:56,531
Evyatar started his new job.

1726
01:40:00,077 --> 01:40:00,994
Really?

1727
01:40:05,624 --> 01:40:09,419
He told me a week ago
that he doesn't want to do it.

1728
01:40:12,756 --> 01:40:13,881
Did it go well?

1729
01:40:14,049 --> 01:40:16,551
Yes. He's happy, thank God.

1730
01:40:22,391 --> 01:40:24,142
And how are you, Viviane?

1731
01:40:25,352 --> 01:40:26,561
I'm fine.

1732
01:40:31,483 --> 01:40:33,359
How much do you smoke a day?

1733
01:40:33,652 --> 01:40:34,652
Not much.

1734
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:35,903
How much?

1735
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:42,994
I don't count.

1736
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:48,666
Viviane...

1737
01:41:35,172 --> 01:41:41,552
THE NEXT DAY
FIVE YEARS SINCE THE TRIAL BEGAN

1738
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:01,364
Witnesses, go ahead.

1739
01:42:32,604 --> 01:42:34,188
Please, come in.

1740
01:42:38,443 --> 01:42:40,945
Give me the divorce papers,
please.

1741
01:42:42,739 --> 01:42:43,698
Thank you.

1742
01:42:48,745 --> 01:42:52,456
Mrs. Amsalem,
come stand here.

1743
01:42:57,963 --> 01:43:01,424
Hold your elbows against your sides.

1744
01:43:02,551 --> 01:43:04,844
Put your hands together.

1745
01:43:05,345 --> 01:43:08,347
No, not like that.
Parallel to the floor.

1746
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:14,395
Your husband will place
the divorce papers in your hands.

1747
01:43:15,564 --> 01:43:17,190
And when it is...

1748
01:43:17,357 --> 01:43:19,317
Not like that, cup your hands.

1749
01:43:19,484 --> 01:43:21,694
Do as I say, cup your hands.

1750
01:43:22,404 --> 01:43:26,115
And when the divorce papers
are in your hands

1751
01:43:26,283 --> 01:43:29,493
you'll close both hands
around the divorce papers,

1752
01:43:29,661 --> 01:43:33,247
place them under your arm,
walk to the door

1753
01:43:33,415 --> 01:43:34,248
and back,

1754
01:43:34,416 --> 01:43:36,918
and thus you buy your divorce.

1755
01:43:37,836 --> 01:43:43,132
You, Elisha Amsalem,
take the divorce papers.

1756
01:43:43,967 --> 01:43:47,637
Hold the divorce papers
over her hands.

1757
01:43:47,804 --> 01:43:51,390
I'll recite and you'll repeat after me
and when finished,

1758
01:43:51,558 --> 01:43:56,062
you'll place the divorce papers
in her hands and let them go.

1759
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:57,855
- Is that clear?
- Yes.

1760
01:43:58,023 --> 01:43:59,148
Repeat after me.

1761
01:43:59,316 --> 01:44:01,234
"This is your divorce."

1762
01:44:01,401 --> 01:44:03,319
This is your divorce.

1763
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:06,197
"Which you receive from me."

1764
01:44:06,365 --> 01:44:08,699
Which you receive from me.

1765
01:44:08,867 --> 01:44:12,662
"And you are hereby divorced
from me hereafter."

1766
01:44:14,081 --> 01:44:17,375
And you are hereby divorced
from me hereafter.

1767
01:44:18,627 --> 01:44:21,545
"And you are hereby permitted
to any man."

1768
01:44:27,636 --> 01:44:32,056
"And you are hereby permitted
to any man."

1769
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:40,815
Repeat after me.

1770
01:44:42,025 --> 01:44:43,442
Repeat after him.

1771
01:44:43,819 --> 01:44:47,196
"And you are hereby permitted
to any man."

1772
01:44:48,532 --> 01:44:50,116
Elisha, say it.

1773
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:52,326
Please don't interrupt.

1774
01:44:52,786 --> 01:44:53,703
Tell her:

1775
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:56,956
"And you are hereby permitted
to any man."

1776
01:45:09,553 --> 01:45:10,344
I...

1777
01:45:10,512 --> 01:45:15,266
- I can't do it.
- What can't you do?!

1778
01:45:15,434 --> 01:45:20,479
Take this couple out of here.
I never want to see them again.

1779
01:45:20,647 --> 01:45:21,981
Take them out now.

1780
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:23,816
- Take them out now!
- Madam, let's go.

1781
01:45:25,819 --> 01:45:27,320
Send them out now!

1782
01:45:27,487 --> 01:45:29,030
Madam, let's go.

1783
01:45:30,449 --> 01:45:32,158
Viviane, come here.

1784
01:45:34,286 --> 01:45:35,995
Please talk to him.

1785
01:45:36,163 --> 01:45:38,039
Madam, please leave.

1786
01:45:38,206 --> 01:45:39,540
Please go.

1787
01:45:39,708 --> 01:45:41,584
Please talk to him.

1788
01:45:41,752 --> 01:45:44,879
We've done all we can.
Please go.

1789
01:45:45,047 --> 01:45:46,797
Witnesses, lead her out.

1790
01:45:47,758 --> 01:45:48,466
Elisha...

1791
01:45:49,468 --> 01:45:50,259
Take them out.

1792
01:45:50,969 --> 01:45:52,053
Madam, let's go.

1793
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:53,804
Let's go.

1794
01:45:54,222 --> 01:45:55,765
- Your Honor...
- It's over.

1795
01:45:56,183 --> 01:46:00,019
Witnesses, get this couple
out of my courtroom.

1796
01:46:01,605 --> 01:46:04,815
- May I talk to you?
- There's nothing to talk about.

1797
01:46:04,983 --> 01:46:07,485
Please, take them out.

1798
01:46:08,737 --> 01:46:10,321
Let's go.

1799
01:46:10,489 --> 01:46:12,073
Please let me talk to you.

1800
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:15,409
I don't want to hear you.
Enough!

1801
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:22,500
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're in contempt of court.

1802
01:46:22,667 --> 01:46:24,126
- Out!
- Let's go, madam!

1803
01:46:26,338 --> 01:46:27,797
I'm not moving.

1804
01:46:30,175 --> 01:46:31,592
Let's go, please.

1805
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:34,178
Let's talk outside.

1806
01:46:35,305 --> 01:46:38,057
- Take this woman out!
- I want my divorce.

1807
01:46:38,225 --> 01:46:39,433
Take the desk with her.

1808
01:46:43,146 --> 01:46:44,730
I'm not leaving!

1809
01:46:46,274 --> 01:46:47,483
Elisha.

1810
01:46:55,325 --> 01:46:57,451
Move away.

1811
01:46:57,619 --> 01:47:00,579
I want to talk to my husband.

1812
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:03,624
Elisha.

1813
01:47:04,501 --> 01:47:05,418
Move back.

1814
01:47:10,674 --> 01:47:13,008
Please!

1815
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:16,762
Give me my freedom.

1816
01:47:18,682 --> 01:47:21,684
Give me my freedom, please.

1817
01:47:22,769 --> 01:47:24,520
Leave me alone!

1818
01:47:24,688 --> 01:47:27,815
It's useless, Viviane, let's go.

1819
01:47:29,276 --> 01:47:32,319
Give me my freedom!

1820
01:47:33,864 --> 01:47:35,865
Give me my divorce.

1821
01:47:36,199 --> 01:47:38,200
Give me, give me!

1822
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:40,202
Viviane, it's useless.

1823
01:47:43,623 --> 01:47:45,749
Give me my freedom!

1824
01:47:45,917 --> 01:47:47,751
Give me my divorce.

1825
01:47:48,336 --> 01:47:51,714
Don't force her,
she'll go alone.

1826
01:47:52,716 --> 01:47:54,592
It's no use, Viviane.

1827
01:47:54,759 --> 01:47:56,927
He won't give it to you.

1828
01:47:59,097 --> 01:48:00,473
Give me...

1829
01:48:15,363 --> 01:48:18,073
Shimon, tell Viviane
I want to talk to her.

1830
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:19,033
What?

1831
01:48:19,201 --> 01:48:22,203
I have to talk to her. Please.

1832
01:48:23,830 --> 01:48:25,331
Please, Shimon.

1833
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:32,630
Viviane, Elisha wants to talk to you
in private.

1834
01:48:32,797 --> 01:48:34,048
Not now.

1835
01:48:34,216 --> 01:48:36,008
Just a few minutes.

1836
01:48:36,593 --> 01:48:38,552
Please. Do you agree?

1837
01:48:48,146 --> 01:48:49,396
You'll give it to me?

1838
01:48:54,694 --> 01:48:58,155
Don't mess with me.

1839
01:48:58,865 --> 01:49:00,241
I'll give it to you.

1840
01:49:02,786 --> 01:49:05,746
And you, Viviane,
what will you give me?

1841
01:49:12,128 --> 01:49:13,128
What do you want?

1842
01:49:29,521 --> 01:49:30,646
Elisha,

1843
01:49:32,899 --> 01:49:34,650
that's what matters to you?

1844
01:49:35,944 --> 01:49:37,444
That's what you want?

1845
01:49:41,658 --> 01:49:43,367
Why ask such a thing of me?

1846
01:49:43,535 --> 01:49:44,952
I don't want to lose you.

1847
01:49:45,620 --> 01:49:47,079
It's already over.

1848
01:49:47,497 --> 01:49:48,998
I love you.

1849
01:50:06,516 --> 01:50:07,808
All right, Elisha.

1850
01:50:10,895 --> 01:50:12,521
As you wish.

1851
01:50:14,482 --> 01:50:16,859
There'll be no one after you.

1852
01:50:17,444 --> 01:50:20,362
- You'll give me my freedom?
- I will.

1853
01:50:33,835 --> 01:50:35,502
Do forgive me, Viviane.

1854
01:50:50,101 --> 01:50:51,101
Are you sure?

1855
01:50:57,651 --> 01:50:58,817
Yes.

1856
01:51:19,172 --> 01:51:20,130
All right.

1857
01:51:22,175 --> 01:51:24,051
Witnesses, come in.
