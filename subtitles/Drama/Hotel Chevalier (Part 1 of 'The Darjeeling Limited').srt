1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My Secret Hotel

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,400
Goo Hae Young...

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,040
Did you really mean it?

4
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,750
What do I do?

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,590
What do I do now?

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,300
Excuse me.

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:35,950
Yes, sir.

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,310
Another bottle please.

9
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,490
Jung Eun.

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,860
Stop crying.

11
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,270
Tears keep coming.

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,600
Hae Young is married now.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,710
You should give up now.

14
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,750
I can't find another man like Goo Hae Young.

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,980
Did you look carefully?

16
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,370
Holding onto someone who's 
not interested in you.

17
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,100
That's...

18
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,300
...obsession.

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,290
I know.

20
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,730
Why is Hae Young holding onto her like that?

21
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,500
Why don't you talk to him, Shi Chan?

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,870
Tell him he's obsessed.

23
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,630
Do you have more tissues?

24
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,990
Shi Chan.

25
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,260
Come to the bar near the office.

26
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,180
Sir.

27
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,300
Sir.

28
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,050
Sir.

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,580
Sir.

30
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:15,980
Let him be.

31
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,250
He's my friend.

32
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,540
Did she go to the restroom?

33
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,510
Jung Eun?

34
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,260
Jung Eun!

35
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,790
Jung Eun.

36
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,980
Jung Eun!

37
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,290
Ugh, really...

38
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,720
By chance...

39
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,670
Las Vegas?

40
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,490
Goo Hae Young.

41
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,230
I'll let you stay over.

42
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,440
Any time you'd like.

43
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,660
Bye.

44
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,030
I knew this would happen.

45
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,520
What?

46
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,600
Where did you sleep last night? 
Who did you sleep with?

47
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,860
Wearing the same clothes...

48
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,040
Look at you...

49
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,650
You were with Joo Jung Eun, huh?

50
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,040
I saw you two disappear in her car.

51
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,450
Hey, you forced her to marry you and...

52
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,630
you made her move in with you.

53
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,680
How can you cheat on her now?

54
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,070
Were you always such a jerk?

55
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,630
Samantha.

56
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,760
I brought some cookies for you.

57
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,690
Samantha, are you leaving?

58
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,320
What about the hotel?

59
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,770
Without him...

60
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,630
it's all meaningless.

61
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,020
I need to go.

62
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,330
I have to see him.

63
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,690
By chance...

64
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,660
Las Vegas?

65
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,670
Did you really...

66
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,330
come looking for him?

67
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:39,970
Excuse me?

68
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,880
Hae Young is in the shower right now.

69
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,470
Do you want to wait inside?

70
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,290
Joo Jung Eun.

71
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,040
Did you see my dress shirt I left out?

72
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
I need to go to Hae Young.

73
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,150
Do you want to come in or not?

74
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,980
Joo Jung Eun, I'm late.

75
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,750
Later...

76
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,200
Just...

77
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,460
don't say anything to him.

78
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,360
Samantha...

79
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,760
Are you really going to leave like this?

80
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,780
I warned you before.

81
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,340
Falling in love at first sight is very risky.

82
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,370
You even quit your job...

83
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,840
He's not worth it.

84
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,280
He's going to regret it for the 
rest of his life for leaving you.

85
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,540
That memory...

86
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,330
I didn't want to remember it again.

87
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,910
I really don't want to think about it.

88
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,260
It's all in the past.

89
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,180
It's all over.

90
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,400
Whoever Goo Hae Young is with...

91
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,530
it has nothing to do with me now.

92
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:03,990
But...

93
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,800
why am I crying so much?

94
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,490
You like Joo Jung Eun, right?

95
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,490
This isn't about whether 
I like Joo Jung Eun or not.

96
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,690
Nothing happened.

97
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,720
I said nothing happened.

98
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,010
How can I believe that?

99
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,620
Fine.

100
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,830
I went over to her place 
last night in her car.

101
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,650
I got sober by the time we got to her house.

102
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,210
Really, nothing happened.

103
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,600
I told you before.

104
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,390
I can't see her as a woman.

105
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,490
Then why did you sleep over there?

106
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,000
Why didn't you go home?

107
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:57,740
Huh?

108
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,460
What if she's not there?

109
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,500
What?

110
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,300
What if she left and wasn't there?

111
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,270
Are you here to see Manager Nam?

112
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,150
Ah...

113
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,960
No, I just...

114
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,690
I was walking by.

115
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,320
You must really miss her.

116
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,280
It's too early for her to be here.

117
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,990
No, I was really just passing by.

118
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,420
Alright.

119
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,050
I'll take your word for it.

120
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,170
Thank you.

121
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,320
Wait...

122
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,060
Assistant Manager Yang.

123
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,580
Please look after Manager Nam.

124
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,640
For awhile...

125
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,280
a lot will happen in the hotel.

126
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,310
Team Leader.

127
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,490
You know Cha Dong Min?

128
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,540
He was charged with manslaughter 
over the death of his classmate.

129
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,070
The classmate who died was no other than 
the nephew of General Manager Lee Moo Yang.

130
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,600
What?

131
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,870
The more shocking things is...

132
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,250
Cha Dong Min who killed his own nephew...

133
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,140
Lee Moo Yang forgave him and 
looked after him in jail.

134
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,780
He didn't want to ignore...

135
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,910
someone so young.

136
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:26,880
Follow me.

137
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,180
I didn't want to hurt Manager Nam.

138
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,320
It was a warning...

139
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,670
to you, Managing Director Jo.

140
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,990
A warning?

141
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,120
Leave this hotel.

142
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,560
If I don't accept your warning,

143
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,590
will I die like others?

144
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,760
What's your reason for going 
this far for General Manager?

145
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,910
This has nothing to do 
with the General Manager.

146
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,160
Do you expect me to believe that?

147
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,800
Go tell the General Manager.

148
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,110
He made a mistake hurting Nam Sang Hyo.

149
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,480
I already requested an open investigation...

150
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,350
with the police.

151
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,810
What's up this early in the morning?

152
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,380
I have a favor to ask you.

153
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,080
Go ahead.

154
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,570
No matter what you hear about me...

155
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,370
...just ignore it.

156
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,670
Tell me you'll do that.

157
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,320
Can you promise me?

158
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,590
I promise.

159
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,700
That's enough then.

160
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,100
I'm fine with that.

161
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,340
Cha Dong Min.

162
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,740
You're under arrest for the 
attempted murder of Nam Sang Hyo.

163
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,570
You have the right to remain 
silent, but I don't recommend it.

164
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,190
Anything you say can be used 
against you in the court.

165
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,820
But it's better to confess everything.

166
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,650
You can hire an attorney, but...

167
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,280
you'll end up in jail anyway.

168
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,610
Oh, my...

169
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,090
What's going on?

170
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,510
How could this happen?

171
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,880
Let's go.

172
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,730
You've come a long way.

173
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:53,890
Oh, my.

174
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,000
What's going on?

175
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,090
Team Leader Cha is...

176
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,260
the serial killer.

177
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,290
What?

178
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,600
Team Leader Cha...

179
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,300
tried to kill Manager Nam.

180
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,470
Manager Nam

181
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,310
Yes, Manager Nam.

182
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,550
Where's Assistant Manager Yang?

183
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,950
She's not here at the moment.

184
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,540
Gi Chul.

185
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,960
I don't think I can go in today.

186
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,530
Oh, oh... why? What's going on?

187
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,010
Did you get hurt by any chance?

188
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,050
Did Team Leader Cha...

189
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,570
It's me.

190
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,190
Yes.

191
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:53,570
Yes.

192
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
I'll take care of everything.

193
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,560
Don't worry.

194
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:58,900
Okay.

195
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,180
Don't ramble on.

196
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,080
No, you can't.

197
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,020
Step aside!

198
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,730
Are you trying to destroy the Secret Hotel?

199
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,350
I'm okay. You can go.

200
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,700
What do you mean open an investigation?

201
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,060
If everything is publicized...

202
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,070
the hotel will be critically impacted.

203
00:17:59,070 --> 00:17:59,680
Why?

204
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,420
Are you afraid?

205
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,310
Behind this beautiful hotel...

206
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,970
dark secrets will be revealed.

207
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,080
Is this about Manager Nam?

208
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,280
I'll be responsible for that...

209
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,510
Did you order Team Leader Cha...

210
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,570
to hurt Manager Nam? 
Are you making your confession?

211
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,010
That's not it. What I'm saying is...

212
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,660
People are dying in this hotel.

213
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,580
We can no longer try to hide it.

214
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,950
One by one...

215
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,920
I'll unveil the truth.

216
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,420
Once I start digging like that,

217
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,330
I'm sure the truth behind 
my father's death...

218
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,310
...will be revealed.

219
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,870
In the end, it comes down to Jo Min Tae...

220
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,600
It's about him.

221
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,660
Because of someone who died thirty years ago,

222
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,250
how dare you place the hotel in danger?

223
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,180
It's already...

224
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,640
way past the statute of limitation.

225
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,090
Even if you find the perpetrator,

226
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,870
you know you can't punish him.

227
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,790
Is that really the case?

228
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,490
Your dark secrets will 
come to light soon enough.

229
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,980
From your face...

230
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,630
the mask that display a gentle 
and respected general manager...

231
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,770
...will fall away at last.

232
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,760
It's a bit late, but...

233
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,490
That's a good enough punishment.

234
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,700
Do you think I'll just 
stand back and watch...

235
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,410
someone like you destroy this hotel?

236
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,140
Stop immediately.

237
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,020
I have no intention of doing that.

238
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,780
Your father was human trash.

239
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,140
Killing your father...

240
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,560
What are you doing?

241
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,800
If you don't stop right now,

242
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,470
you'll be the one who'll regret it the most.

243
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,840
Please leave the country with 
Managing Director Jo immediately.

244
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,740
Before it's too late.

245
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,650
Nam Sang Hyo

246
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,690
Hey.

247
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,060
You should go home early today.

248
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,400
You stayed out last night.

249
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,720
You should go home early and...

250
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,390
prepare the dinner table.

251
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,070
Beg forgiveness from Sang Hyo.

252
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,650
If she asks you what happened last night,

253
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,440
tell her you were with me.

254
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,740
I'm your...

255
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,580
...alibi expert.

256
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,450
Did you forget?

257
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,130
Last time when the detective came by...

258
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,720
"He has an alibi."

259
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,550
"He was with me last night."

260
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,350
Hurry up and go home.

261
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,660
Will she be home?

262
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,650
What...

263
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,380
What if...

264
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,470
...she's gone?

265
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:43,970
Hey.

266
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,200
if you...

267
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,140
go home late tonight again...

268
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,660
even if she was home...

269
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,540
she'll leave for good.

270
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,780
Go home.

271
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,780
Be a man.

272
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,780
Tell her you were with me.

273
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,090
You want to taste?

274
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:42,720
Yes.

275
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,720
It's so good.

276
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,080
You came.

277
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,800
Goo Hae Young.

278
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,090
I'll let you stay over.

279
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,820
Any time you'd like.

280
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,130
Did you eat?

281
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,000
Do you want me to make you something?

282
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,070
No.

283
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,190
I don't feel like eating.

284
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,770
Last night...

285
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,570
Are you mad I stayed out last night?

286
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,000
Actually...

287
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,380
I was afraid you wouldn't be here...

288
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,320
I didn't want to come home.

289
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,090
Sorry.

290
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:27,920
So?

291
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,720
Where were you?

292
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,290
Huh?

293
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,220
Ugh...

294
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,620
With Shi Chan...

295
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,100
At work.

296
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,710
I see.

297
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,140
Alright.

298
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,090
Are you mad?

299
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,440
No.

300
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,330
I'm tired.

301
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,900
I'll get some rest.

302
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,850
I won't cry over you again.

303
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,900
Nam Sang Hyo.

304
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,590
Nam Sang Hyo!

305
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,670
Nam Sang Hyo.

306
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,550
Are you okay?

307
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,070
What about me?

308
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,440
I thought Team Leader Cha tried to kill you.

309
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:51,940
What?

310
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,170
Didn't you know?

311
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,100
Oh, my...

312
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,020
He tried without your knowledge?

313
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,010
What are you talking about?

314
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,890
Team Leader Cha was arrested yesterday.

315
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,430
For attempting to murder you.

316
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,280
Team Leader Cha tried to kill me?

317
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,510
That's what I'm saying.

318
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,940
The police arrested him yesterday.

319
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,910
The hotel was completely upside down.

320
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,050
Then...

321
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:16,950
that day, too...

322
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,370
No, there's no way...

323
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,470
Something happened, huh?

324
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,070
Right?

325
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:28,870
Oh, my...

326
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,960
What should I do?

327
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,280
The reporters are calling already.

328
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,490
What should I tell them?

329
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,220
Hello, Reporter Lee.

330
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,900
Yes.

331
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,790
I can't believe it.

332
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,530
Manager Nam.

333
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:46,960
It's Team Leader Cha for sure.

334
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,780
No...

335
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,900
until the police investigation is over...

336
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,500
No...

337
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,830
I'm sure.

338
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,250
Gi Chul, stop it.

339
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,750
You didn't witness him yourself, Gi Chul.

340
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,510
You shouldn't say...

341
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,640
...something you're not sure about.

342
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,630
I mean...

343
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,200
Ugh, I should've never come to this hotel.

344
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:15,750
Sang Hyo.

345
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,410
You have to go somewhere with me right now.

346
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,320
What?

347
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,120
What about the hotel serial killer?

348
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,790
Say that again?

349
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,230
What did the serial killer 
try to do to Sang Hyo?

350
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,620
Hello.

351
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,620
Joo Jung Eun.

352
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,500
Joo Jung Eun!

353
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,650
Goo Hae Young

354
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,990
Where are you going?

355
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:13,960
Where are you going?

356
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,710
To Sang Hyo...

357
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,500
What about her?

358
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,230
Hey, you look crazy right now.

359
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:34,450
Police Station

360
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,300
I don't know what I should tell them.

361
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,980
I still can't believe...

362
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,040
Team Leader Cha tried to kill me.

363
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,910
You just need to tell them what happened.

364
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,320
We're almost there...

365
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,490
...General Manager Lee Moo Yang.

366
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,750
Wait a little longer.

367
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,140
Let's go, Sang Hyo.

368
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,550
- Sit, sit. 
- Okay.

369
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,590
Everything is completely...

370
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,390
...solved.

371
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,640
What are you talking about?

372
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,140
Cha Dong Min confessed.

373
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,850
Cha Dong Min confessed?

374
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:01,330
Yes.

375
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,430
He said he killed Hwang Dong Bae, 
Heo Young Mi and tried to kill Nam Sang Hyo.

376
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,320
Oh...

377
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,290
It's okay.

378
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,150
No need to be afraid.

379
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,790
Since he confessed all that,

380
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,370
he he'll never see the light of day.

381
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,290
What was the motivation for the murders?

382
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,130
Well, that...

383
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,360
This is...

384
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,350
...what he said.

385
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,450
What's your reason for murdering them?

386
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,460
Do I need...

387
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,650
...a reason to kill people?

388
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,520
I just didn't like them, so I killed them.

389
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,610
Managing Director.

390
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,180
Do you really believe what he's telling you?

391
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,850
He's trying to hide his tail right now.

392
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,850
I'll tell you honestly.

393
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,870
Now that we have a confession 
without evidence,

394
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,830
there's a good possibility 
the case will be close soon.

395
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,010
What you're telling me is...

396
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,050
Your request for an open investigation...

397
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,270
is water under the bridge.

398
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,300
Ah...

399
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,080
They caught the perpetrator?

400
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,190
Okay, Jung Eun.

401
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,070
Did you hear that?

402
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,810
Nothing happened to Sang Hyo and...

403
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:16,740
they caught the perpetrator.

404
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,270
But...

405
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,700
earlier...

406
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,340
you ran off like a crazy man.

407
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,520
Why did you stop yourself?

408
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,610
Just...

409
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,240
didn't feel like I needed to be there.

410
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,390
I thought they'd be together.

411
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,160
Do I need...

412
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,330
...a reason to kill people?

413
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,230
Sang Hyo.

414
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,930
Don't think about anything today. Just rest.

415
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,140
Sang Hyo.

416
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,760
Are you okay?

417
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,530
I'm sorry.

418
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,920
Scary thoughts keep coming to me.

419
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,360
I'm so sorry.

420
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,930
I was so angry.

421
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,110
I didn't consider how scared you'd be.

422
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,180
I'm really sorry.

423
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,370
That's okay.

424
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:27,850
Sang Hyo.

425
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,400
I won't put you in any danger in the future.

426
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,370
So...

427
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,100
don't be scared.

428
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,810
You think you can do that?

429
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,670
Come here.

430
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,920
You won't be scared anymore.

431
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,450
Goo Hae Young.

432
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,740
Where are you?

433
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,360
I'm scared.

434
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:43,800
Ugh...

435
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,140
What are you doing?

436
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,250
Why are you drinking again?

437
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,640
You didn't make up with her yet?

438
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,940
I want to let her go now.

439
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:53,890
What?

440
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,870
I don't think she needs me now.

441
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,210
I wanted to believe I'm the one for her.

442
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,540
But...

443
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,460
I don't think I'm the one.

444
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,310
Like you said...

445
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,120
I forced her to marry me and...

446
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,840
made her go on the honeymoon...

447
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,520
and made her move into my house.

448
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,160
I'll stop now.

449
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,430
I'll let her go now.

450
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,450
Goo Hae Young.

451
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,080
What's...

452
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,270
...wrong with you?

453
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,770
I've been acting like an idiot.

454
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,570
Singing like an idiot...

455
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:45,880
Floating around everywhere like an idiot.

456
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,420
Like an idiot...

457
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,910
I won't do it anymore.

458
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,580
I don't care if I'm an idiot or...

459
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,180
it's okay if I act crazy.

460
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,300
But Sang Hyo may be suffering.

461
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,400
Because of me...

462
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,010
I think she struggled a lot.

463
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,450
Now...

464
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,390
I'll let her go.

465
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,620
Careful...

466
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,910
Over here...

467
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,010
Sang Hyo.

468
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,900
If there's a misunderstanding, don't be.

469
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,270
The night he stayed out...

470
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,160
he was with me.

471
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,120
With me...

472
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,040
Okay.

473
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,880
Alright then...

474
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,780
don't walk me out.

475
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,880
Take care of...

476
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,710
...Hae Young.

477
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,000
Okay.

478
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,080
Today was...

479
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,680
...really a long day for me.

480
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,420
But right this moment...

481
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,590
is the hardest moment.

482
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,420
Hae Young...

483
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,740
It's so hard for me.

484
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:38,110
What brings you here at this hour?

485
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,720
Do you plan on getting away with everything 
by putting blame on Team Leader Cha?

486
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,020
Do you think I'll give up like this?

487
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:52,140
Whatever you do...

488
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,760
you'd better do it fast.

489
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,760
Soon...

490
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,550
with the agenda to dismiss you...

491
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,650
there will be a board of directors meeting.

492
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,770
You want to kick me out now?

493
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,520
Things won't go as planned.

494
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,270
Well...

495
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,560
Don't underestimate me.

496
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,350
Alright then.

497
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,690
You're still up.

498
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:44,730
Yeah...

499
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:45,190
I'm still up.

500
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,430
Was it the General Manager?

501
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:04,910
Sung Gyum.

502
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,060
You and the General Manager...

503
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:11,050
What do you two have to 
talk about at this hour?

504
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,250
What are you hiding from me?

505
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,560
There's no such a thing.

506
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:16,770
Mother.

507
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,030
You really don't have anything to tell me?

508
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,080
Let's stop.

509
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:23,810
Okay?

510
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,600
I'm...

511
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,100
I'm begging you.

512
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,440
No.

513
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,720
I'll find father's killer and...

514
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,860
make him pay for his crime.

515
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,200
If truth is unveiled...

516
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,920
you and...

517
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,710
she will also get hurt.

518
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,660
If the truth is unveiled...

519
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,370
you and...

520
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,170
she will also get hurt.

521
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,110
She?

522
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,460
So, stop here.

523
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,510
Nothing good will come out 
of digging old wounds.

524
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:17,450
I...

525
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,150
can't forgive her father.

526
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:22,650
But...

527
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,790
if you stop digging into this...

528
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,790
I'll also forget it.

529
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:58,290
Don't shake up Manager Nam.

530
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,360
The General Manager...

531
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,330
He's like a father to me.

532
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,180
Hi, Simon.

533
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,950
Find the adoption paperwork on Nam Sang Hyo.

534
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:51,970
Eat.

535
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,650
I thought this would be better than ramen.

536
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,350
Really?

537
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,120
Whoever you meet...

538
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,270
Whatever you do...

539
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,520
I don't care.

540
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,340
But...

541
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,190
don't drink 'til...

542
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,180
you can't walk straight.

543
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,260
Okay.

544
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,610
It just happened.

545
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:44,640
This is really good.

546
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,330
Your cooking has improved.

547
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:49,500
Enjoy.

548
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:51,230
Sang Hyo.

549
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:58,520
You staying here...

550
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,540
aren't you uncomfortable?

551
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:06,430
Jo Sung Gyum...

552
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,680
must not be happy about it 
either. You living here.

553
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:12,440
If you're doing it for the reporters...

554
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,170
I'll do my best to stop them.

555
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:14,820
So...

556
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:16,720
no need to...

557
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:19,890
stay here reluctantly.

558
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:23,880
You must be running late.

559
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,960
Go ahead.

560
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:13,660
Manager Nam Sang Hyo.

561
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,710
Here is her adoption document.

562
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,370
Hae Young.

563
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:27,540
Someone's...

564
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,630
...here for you.

565
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,220
Don't you...

566
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,730
...remember me?

567
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:40,840
True...

568
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:43,760
An old man who walked the 
bride down the aisle...

569
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,010
Of course you didn't have time to see me.

570
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:48,880
With a beautiful bride in front of you.

571
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:50,780
Ah...

572
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:53,950
I'm sorry.

573
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,860
Nam Sang Hyo. Wore a bonnet with lace. 
Wrapped inside the Secret Hotel tablecloth.

574
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,100
Guardian - Lee Moo Yang

575
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,380
Manager Nam Sang Hyo is...

576
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:29,120
...like a daughter to me.

577
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,220
When she came to me...

578
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,040
and said she's doing the wedding with you,

579
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,120
I opposed it.

580
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:40,610
It was to replace a runaway bride.

581
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,030
I said it's complete nonsense.

582
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:43,770
But...

583
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,370
I ended up...

584
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,920
walking her down the aisle.

585
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,440
Do you know why?

586
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,570
In Manager Nam's eyes...

587
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:56,340
I saw her true feelings.

588
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,950
I'm sure it wasn't feelings for me.

589
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,720
- It was just for the hotel. 
- No.

590
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:07,790
She is a responsible person, but...

591
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,530
she wouldn't do something like 
that if her heart wasn't in it.

592
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,880
Trust me on this.

593
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,010
Manager Nam...

594
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:18,880
I know her very well.

595
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,680
Managing Director Jo and Manager Nam...

596
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,670
They should never be together.

597
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:23,870
The minute...

598
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,010
you let go of her...

599
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,270
Manager Nam will become unhappy.

600
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:06,240
Why does it have to be you?

601
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,400
You staying here...

602
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,440
Aren't you uncomfortable? So...

603
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:33,340
you don't...

604
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:36,470
have to stay here reluctantly.

605
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:52,590
In Manager Nam's eyes...

606
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,590
I saw her true feelings.

607
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,850
Sang Hyo.

608
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:38,600
Thanks.

609
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:14,800
Please go.

610
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:17,360
Samantha left already.

611
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,070
She's too pretty to be left alone.

612
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:23,060
Samantha already left with someone.

613
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,530
Someone better than you.

614
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:25,850
Someone who truly loves her.

615
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:19,970
Managing Director.

616
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,580
Sorry for calling you out.

617
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,540
I just...

618
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:35,650
...missed you.

619
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:41,250
Maybe you'll never...

620
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:47,190
...want to see me again.

621
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:50,530
Perhaps I...

622
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,830
may not be able to wait for you.

623
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,500
That's why I came.

624
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:02,940
I said I'd wait for you.

625
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:07,110
I asked you not to forget 
about me waiting for you.

626
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,950
I'm sorry for...

627
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:12,920
saying this to you first.

628
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:15,750
No, Managing Director.

629
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:17,690
Don't feel bad toward me.

630
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,260
Everything's...

631
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:22,760
...my fault.

632
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,950
Just like I can't...

633
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:34,640
forgive that person...

634
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:37,870
you probably couldn't...

635
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:40,310
forgive me either, right?

636
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,010
Now...

637
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:49,350
I won't be able to...

638
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,820
hold onto you any longer.

639
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:57,260
No matter what happens...

640
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,430
the fact that my feelings were genuine...

641
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,300
please know that.

642
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:13,140
I'll get going first.

643
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:15,440
Bye, Sang Hyo.

644
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,120
See me for a minute, Lee Moo Yang.

645
00:55:57,910 --> 00:55:59,770
What do you have in mind for my Sung Gyum?

646
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:00,700
Do you want...

647
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,420
everyone to know our relationship?

648
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,060
Follow me.

649
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,930
Why are you dismissing Sung Gyum?

650
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:29,250
That's the only way we can remove 
Managing Director Jo from this hotel.

651
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,650
My Sung Gyum...

652
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:32,520
He has a bright future.

653
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,040
I can't let you leave a 
tainted mark on his career.

654
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:39,090
So that Sung Gyum can resign on his own...

655
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:39,790
please wait.

656
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,260
I can't do that.

657
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,280
Lee Moo Yang.

658
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,380
You told me to trust you.

659
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,830
Is this the outcome for trusting you?

660
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:49,750
Is ruining my son's life the 
result I get for trusting you?

661
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:51,770
I'll tell all.

662
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:53,840
I'll just tell everything!

663
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,620
Calm down.

664
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,640
Do you really want to end everything?

665
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:58,830
Everything can be destroyed this way.

666
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,930
What are you doing?

667
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:05,880
Sung Gyum.

668
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,680
No.

669
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:10,570
Killing my father wasn't enough for 
you? You're trying to kill my mother?

670
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:13,220
A moron like you...

671
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,190
should never be forgiven.

672
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:15,890
No.

673
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,730
- Someone like you... 
- Sung Gyum, no!

674
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:19,100
No, no!

675
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,960
With my own hands...

676
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,950
I'll take you out!

677
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,900
By doing so...

678
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,750
No, Sung Gyum! No!

679
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:33,530
I killed him!

680
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:35,780
Your father...

681
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,600
I killed your father!

682
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,100
I did...

683
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:44,240
I killed your father.

684
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:01,490
Don't!

685
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,710
Without the child in your womb...

686
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:11,400
you probably wouldn't be with me, right?

687
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:15,270
Please don't do this.

688
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:20,470
Just because you're saying that...

689
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:22,910
you think I'll stop?

690
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:27,830
Hey!

691
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:28,960
What are you doing?

692
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,560
Huh?

693
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,250
You always seem to know when to show up.

694
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:37,740
Drop it...

695
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:38,690
...now.

696
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,780
You want to kill me, right?

697
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:45,310
Jo Min Tae!

698
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:46,160
If I hadn't...

699
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:49,330
taken her away from you by force...

700
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:52,270
you two would be happy together.

701
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,140
Do you know this?

702
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:57,210
Around her neck...

703
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:00,780
she still has the necklace you gave her.

704
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:04,980
Today...

705
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,920
either you or her...

706
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,500
I'll have to kill one of you.

707
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:11,840
Please...

708
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,920
put that down.

709
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:31,090
Stop!

710
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:32,150
Stop, stop...

711
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,970
Calm down.

712
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:49,210
That's it.

713
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:11,700
No!

714
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:18,990
Hwang Dong Bae

715
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,240
I...

716
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,690
ran away with you after that.

717
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:38,200
His sin...

718
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:41,300
is covering up for my crime and...

719
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:45,220
protecting me all my life.

720
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:49,120
Because of that sin...

721
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,060
he struggled with...

722
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:53,140
Hwang Dong Bae's threats for thirty years.

723
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:17,070
That's a lie, right?

724
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,270
Mother.

725
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:20,950
You're lying, right?

726
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:23,710
I was out of it for a moment.

727
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:28,190
I hated him to death.

728
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,460
I really wanted to kill him, but...

729
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:36,300
I wasn't really going to kill him.

730
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:37,820
Really...

731
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:39,890
Please...

732
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:43,110
tell me you're lying.

733
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:43,990
Please...

734
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,560
Don't forgive your mother.

735
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,030
I'm sorry.

736
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:55,220
I'm sorry, son.

737
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:05,060
Sung Gyum.

738
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,650
Sung Gyum.

739
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:08,570
Sung Gyum.

740
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:09,850
Sung Gyum.

741
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:12,750
Sung Gyum.

742
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,140
Nam Sang Hyo.

743
01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:38,410
What do I do now?

744
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:46,420
Sang Hyo.

745
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:50,560
Without you...

746
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:53,790
how should I go on?

747
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:08,270
Nam Sang Hyo.

748
01:04:10,330 --> 01:04:11,580
who are you...

749
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:14,850
crying over right now?

750
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,610
I'm leaving for the States 
after this project.

751
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,700
I can't forget you completely here.

752
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:33,820
I submitted my resignation letter today.

753
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:37,670
Nam Sang Hyo!

754
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:38,820
Sang Hyo!

755
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:42,320
If you ask me to stay if you need me,

756
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,860
then...

757
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,080
I'll take you back.

758
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:47,680
Why did you ask me to come back?

759
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,850
Why didn't you leave me alone?
