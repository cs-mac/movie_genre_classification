1
00:01:50,174 --> 00:01:52,438
Before the dawn of history,

2
00:01:52,643 --> 00:01:56,272
Even since the first man
discovered his soul,

3
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,641
He has struggled against the forces

4
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:01,113
That sought to enslave him.

5
00:02:01,318 --> 00:02:03,286
He saw the awful power of nature

6
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:05,011
Arrayed against him

7
00:02:05,222 --> 00:02:07,690
The evil eye of the lightning,

8
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:11,054
The terrifying voice of the thunder,

9
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:13,855
The shrieking, wind-filled darkness

10
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:18,330
Enslaving his mind
with shackles of fear.

11
00:02:18,535 --> 00:02:22,562
Fear bred superstition,
blinding his reason.

12
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:26,106
He was ridden by a host of devil gods.

13
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,407
Human dignity perished
on the altar of idolatry.

14
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:34,083
And tyranny arose,

15
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:38,311
Grinding the human spirit
beneath the conqueror's heel.

16
00:02:38,522 --> 00:02:41,423
But deep in man's heart still burned

17
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:45,254
The unquenchable will for freedom.

18
00:02:45,462 --> 00:02:49,922
When this divine spark flames
in the soul of some mortal...

19
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:51,828
Whether priest or soldier,

20
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:53,832
Artist or patriot,

21
00:02:54,037 --> 00:02:56,062
Lover or statesman...

22
00:02:56,273 --> 00:02:59,538
His deeds have changed
the course of human events

23
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:03,270
And his name survives the ages.

24
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,038
l n the village of Norah,

25
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:07,080
ln the land of Dan,

26
00:03:07,284 --> 00:03:10,776
1 ,000 years before the birth of Christ,

27
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:13,047
Lived such a man.

28
00:03:13,257 --> 00:03:18,285
ln him, the elements had fused
greatness and weakness,

29
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:20,429
Strength and folly.

30
00:03:20,631 --> 00:03:24,431
But with these, was a bold dream...

31
00:03:24,635 --> 00:03:27,331
Liberty for his nation.

32
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:30,062
The man's name was Samson.

33
00:03:30,274 --> 00:03:31,741
For 40 years,

34
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:38,404
The philistines had held
his people in bondage.

35
00:03:38,682 --> 00:03:45,679
l drove three score goats to Zorah
seeking for a wife

36
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:53,352
But her father said get more
or you'll lead a lonely life...

37
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:57,524
And he said,

38
00:03:57,734 --> 00:04:00,066
When you return to Egypt,

39
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:05,799
See that you do all the wonders
which l have put in your hand.

40
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:08,603
And the lord said unto Moses,

41
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:15,240
Get you up unto pharaoh
and bring forth my people out of Egypt.

42
00:04:15,686 --> 00:04:17,916
Pharaoh ruled the Egyptians

43
00:04:18,121 --> 00:04:20,487
As the saran rules
the philistines here...

44
00:04:20,691 --> 00:04:22,124
And the philistines rule us.

45
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:24,260
Saul, let him tell it.

46
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:26,827
Pharaoh said to Moses,

47
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,089
Who is this lord?

48
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:31,426
l know him not.

49
00:04:31,635 --> 00:04:36,038
Your people are my slaves,
and l will not let them go.

50
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:38,639
But they got away through the Red Sea.

51
00:04:38,842 --> 00:04:41,208
Someday, we'll show the saran

52
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:45,040
That stone can fly just as straight
as philistine spears.

53
00:04:45,248 --> 00:04:47,273
Tell him what that slingshot's for.

54
00:04:47,484 --> 00:04:48,143
Yes, tell him.

55
00:04:48,352 --> 00:04:51,913
Guard your tongue, Saul.

56
00:04:52,122 --> 00:04:55,614
Some thoughts must not be spoken.

57
00:04:55,826 --> 00:04:57,521
May l fill my pitcher, Miriam?

58
00:04:57,728 --> 00:05:00,424
We'll fill it together,
little Samaritan.

59
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,690
And the lord spoke unto Moses
and to Aaron,

60
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,065
Saying, when pharaoh shall say unto you

61
00:05:09,272 --> 00:05:12,400
Show a miracle for you...
Then you shall...

62
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:16,670
You shall swallow your tongue, old goat.

63
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,780
Now, here's something
for you to learn...

64
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:21,212
Bow when a philistine passes!

65
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:22,942
We are a conquered people.

66
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:25,485
We bow only to the invisible lord.

67
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:28,522
Every philistine is your lord.

68
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:30,022
Bow!

69
00:05:30,227 --> 00:05:31,319
Look, you scum of Dan,

70
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:33,325
Here's how to greet your masters.

71
00:05:33,563 --> 00:05:35,121
Brave philistines...

72
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:38,665
Showing your courage
against children and old men.

73
00:05:38,869 --> 00:05:41,770
Well...

74
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:43,337
Here's a jug of Dante wine

75
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:45,632
We haven't tasted

76
00:05:45,842 --> 00:05:47,332
lf you come near Miriam,

77
00:05:47,577 --> 00:05:50,205
Samson will crack your head
like a walnut.

78
00:05:50,414 --> 00:05:53,349
Samson!

79
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,153
He saves his strength for the wenches!

80
00:05:58,355 --> 00:06:01,347
The power of the lord
is in Samson's arm,

81
00:06:01,558 --> 00:06:03,116
And, one day, you shall feel it.

82
00:06:03,326 --> 00:06:06,227
Croak in the mud, old frog.

83
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,227
Ha ha ha ha!

84
00:06:08,432 --> 00:06:09,626
Ha ha ha ha!

85
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,266
Run! Get off the street!

86
00:06:11,468 --> 00:06:13,368
Let the old mud turtle, yell for Samson!

87
00:06:13,603 --> 00:06:16,572
Ha ha ha ha!

88
00:06:17,073 --> 00:06:19,439
Go on, Saul, throw it.

89
00:06:19,643 --> 00:06:20,667
Aim for the big one.

90
00:06:20,877 --> 00:06:21,809
No, Saul, no.

91
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:22,944
l'll stop one of them.

92
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:26,673
You will bring death to the village.

93
00:06:26,883 --> 00:06:30,842
Samson is our warrior.

94
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:36,351
A leader...you? Ha.

95
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,050
Certainly, l know where you were.

96
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:40,354
Lesh Lakish told me.

97
00:06:40,564 --> 00:06:42,759
You were brawling through
the streets of Timnath

98
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:44,228
With the philistines,

99
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:46,902
Drinking and dice-throwing
with our enemies.

100
00:06:47,103 --> 00:06:49,230
l was learning their ways.

101
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,532
You'd better learn the ways of the lord.

102
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:54,073
Mm-mmm. You're the best cook in Zorah.

103
00:06:54,277 --> 00:06:56,541
And you're the worst son.

104
00:06:56,746 --> 00:06:58,873
You, the leader of Dan,

105
00:06:59,082 --> 00:07:00,845
Chosen judge of you're people.

106
00:07:01,051 --> 00:07:02,143
And what would you do?

107
00:07:02,352 --> 00:07:04,286
Marry a daughter of our enemies.

108
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:08,652
A philistine to be the mother
of Samson's children.

109
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:13,228
l ought to spank you as l did,
and not so long ago.

110
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,298
Run along,
or your mother will tan your hide, too.

111
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:20,493
Yeah, that's the truth.

112
00:07:20,704 --> 00:07:22,638
Now look what you've done.

113
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:26,297
Oh, you're a stubborn, witless ox.

114
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,445
l'm your son.

115
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:30,578
Oh, Samson,

116
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,645
Why can't you be like
our neighbors' sons...

117
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:35,044
Content to watch their fathers' flocks

118
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:37,220
And choose a wife from our own village?

119
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,580
Forbidden figs are sweeter.

120
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:39,880
But the sweetest figs grow

121
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,581
Right in your own garden.

122
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:45,522
Miriam's hands are never idle.

123
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:48,129
No cross words ever pass her lips.

124
00:07:48,331 --> 00:07:49,628
You would harness this angel

125
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,630
To a stubborn, witless ox?

126
00:07:51,835 --> 00:07:54,303
You're not all bad, Samson.

127
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:56,701
But your eyes always find
what they shouldn't.

128
00:07:56,907 --> 00:07:57,999
Why, a wife like Miriam

129
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:02,406
Would bring out the good in you.

130
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:03,237
A man must marry

131
00:08:03,446 --> 00:08:07,075
Where his heart leads him,
little mother.

132
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:09,752
A man's heart can be blind, son.

133
00:08:09,953 --> 00:08:11,648
Samson, Samson!

134
00:08:11,855 --> 00:08:13,618
Some philistine soldiers at the well.

135
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,619
Who this time, father?

136
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:16,189
The old storyteller.

137
00:08:16,393 --> 00:08:18,486
The soldiers left, the trouble's passed.

138
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:20,560
The trouble with him isn't passed.

139
00:08:20,764 --> 00:08:22,254
Tell Miriam.

140
00:08:22,465 --> 00:08:23,397
Now, Hazell.

141
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,694
Wait and hear what your son is about.

142
00:08:26,903 --> 00:08:29,997
Go on. Tell her.

143
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:33,175
Go on.

144
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:44,049
This time, you must have done something
really terrible.

145
00:08:44,254 --> 00:08:48,520
Miriam, you're further
above me than the moon.

146
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:51,250
But not as hard to reach.

147
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:54,055
Only stretch out your hand.

148
00:08:54,264 --> 00:08:57,825
l don't want to hurt you, Miriam.

149
00:08:58,034 --> 00:09:02,266
You're like a sparrow, so gentle and...

150
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:04,497
That's a very gentle way of telling me

151
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:08,735
That you're in love with someone else.

152
00:09:08,945 --> 00:09:10,139
You always see through people

153
00:09:10,347 --> 00:09:14,511
As...if they were cobwebs.

154
00:09:14,718 --> 00:09:18,848
l hear you saw a woman in Timnath.

155
00:09:19,055 --> 00:09:21,455
Yes...

156
00:09:21,658 --> 00:09:26,618
And l can't forget her.

157
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:30,495
lt is the same with me.

158
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,659
l can't forget you.

159
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,309
Miriam.

160
00:09:43,546 --> 00:09:47,505
l'll always be here.

161
00:10:00,196 --> 00:10:01,220
What did l tell you?

162
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:07,392
He wants to marry a philistine.

163
00:10:09,606 --> 00:10:10,402
Samson...

164
00:10:10,607 --> 00:10:13,474
You would not bring this shame upon us.

165
00:10:13,677 --> 00:10:15,508
There's no shame in marriage, father.

166
00:10:15,712 --> 00:10:17,373
To a philistine woman?

167
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,038
Father, Semadar pleases me.

168
00:10:21,251 --> 00:10:22,479
Go to Tubal of Timnath

169
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:24,244
And say l will take
his daughter to wife.

170
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:26,046
The law forbids it.

171
00:10:26,256 --> 00:10:28,952
A philistine law?

172
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:32,128
Samson.

173
00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:40,025
Oh, Samson, what will come to you
on the road you're traveling?

174
00:10:40,537 --> 00:10:42,630
A golden-haired wife, little mother,

175
00:10:42,872 --> 00:10:46,899
Who won't beat me with wooden spoons.

176
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,407
Ohh...oh, Samson, Samson,

177
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:51,409
You're blind.

178
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:52,911
You turn away from Mirian,

179
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:57,177
From everything that's good
in your life!

180
00:10:57,387 --> 00:11:01,323
Just because he's seen a woman
at Timnath...

181
00:11:01,524 --> 00:11:07,485
A woman in silks and jewels.

182
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,490
Ohh...

183
00:11:12,702 --> 00:11:15,364
Magnificent.

184
00:11:15,572 --> 00:11:17,005
Ooh, Your rich gifts

185
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:18,674
Rob me of words, Ahtur.

186
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,900
They'll rob you of a daughter, Tubal,

187
00:11:21,111 --> 00:11:27,072
And enrich me with a wife.

188
00:11:27,517 --> 00:11:29,485
The military governor of Dan

189
00:11:29,686 --> 00:11:31,620
Does my house great honor.

190
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:35,154
Semadar is a fit mate for a soldier.

191
00:11:35,358 --> 00:11:39,158
Now, here's a new weave
from the looms of Gaza.

192
00:11:39,362 --> 00:11:43,321
They call it gauze.

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,560
Oh, beautiful...

194
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,794
Beautiful!

195
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:53,374
Take it over to the light.

196
00:11:53,576 --> 00:11:54,668
Semadar.

197
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:57,847
Semada...

198
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:10,521
But you haven't even shown...

199
00:12:10,727 --> 00:12:11,853
She throws the javelin

200
00:12:12,061 --> 00:12:13,460
Like the goddess Dictynna.

201
00:12:13,663 --> 00:12:14,527
l'm taking her with me

202
00:12:14,731 --> 00:12:18,030
On the saran's lion hunt...
With your permission.

203
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:22,261
Oh, yes, of...of course, of course.

204
00:12:22,472 --> 00:12:24,372
You know, l have another daughter...

205
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:26,337
Semadar's younger sister.

206
00:12:26,543 --> 00:12:31,503
Oh, unbelievable beauty.

207
00:12:35,718 --> 00:12:38,710
That's a good throw.

208
00:12:38,922 --> 00:12:44,883
But the lion's heart's at the other end.

209
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:49,128
Have you lost your senses?

210
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:53,598
The hunting party and
the saran are coming from Gaza.

211
00:12:53,803 --> 00:12:54,599
l'll help him kill the lion.

212
00:12:54,804 --> 00:12:57,272
You'd rather help the lion
kill the saran.

213
00:12:57,473 --> 00:12:59,737
Not until he gives permission
for our marriage.

214
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:01,501
Our marriage?

215
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:03,508
You have lost your senses.

216
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:05,840
And my heart.

217
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:09,314
You've whispered that
in a lot of pretty ears.

218
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,479
None as pretty as yours.

219
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:25,626
My sister does her lion
hunting with plum pits.

220
00:13:25,802 --> 00:13:28,794
Be good, now,
or the game may eat the hunter.

221
00:13:29,038 --> 00:13:33,941
l can't really blame her
for hunting you.

222
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:36,941
Samson, you are rather like a lion.

223
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:39,205
Then you should learn more
about lion hunting.

224
00:13:39,415 --> 00:13:41,815
Proud and strong and fearless.

225
00:13:42,018 --> 00:13:44,452
But not very wise.

226
00:13:44,654 --> 00:13:45,712
Ahtur.

227
00:13:45,922 --> 00:13:49,016
Here. l brought a thorn for a rose.

228
00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:51,819
Oh, thank you, Ahtur.

229
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:56,020
Balances perfectly.

230
00:13:56,432 --> 00:13:57,456
There's only one Danite

231
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:03,572
Fool enough to climb this wall.

232
00:14:06,242 --> 00:14:10,269
The governor of Dan has a hunter's eye.

233
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,344
l just told Semadar...

234
00:14:11,547 --> 00:14:15,506
Yes, l heard you.

235
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,045
You'll hunt from my chariot today,
Semadar.

236
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:25,455
Samson thinks he can help us
kill the lion.

237
00:14:25,662 --> 00:14:27,687
We're very grateful,

238
00:14:27,864 --> 00:14:29,229
But the lord of the five cities,

239
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:32,663
Whose conquests reach
from the Nile to Babylon,

240
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:37,465
May succeed without the assistance
of a judge of shepherds.

241
00:14:37,674 --> 00:14:41,542
A shepherd needs to know
more about lions than a king.

242
00:14:41,744 --> 00:14:43,473
His life depends upon it.

243
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,113
A shepherd obeys the law.

244
00:14:45,315 --> 00:14:47,545
His life depends on that.

245
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,877
The first law your fathers learned

246
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:54,852
Was to bow before philistine spears.

247
00:14:55,058 --> 00:14:59,825
You like to have people
bow to the might of spears.

248
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:02,964
l like to have spears...

249
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:06,135
Bow to people.

250
00:15:11,307 --> 00:15:13,104
Especially beautiful women.

251
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:14,037
You destroy a weapon

252
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:16,507
You lack the skillto use.

253
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:20,114
Perhaps Semadar will teach me...

254
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:21,783
After our marriage.

255
00:15:21,985 --> 00:15:24,920
Marriage to...

256
00:15:25,788 --> 00:15:33,092
Your humor is even greater than
your strength.

257
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:33,921
The saran.

258
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:41,626
The judge of Dan would do well
to leave the way he came...

259
00:15:46,642 --> 00:15:52,603
And seek a bride in some other pasture.

260
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,817
Ahtur!
Ahtur!

261
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:00,216
Hail, great majesty.

262
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:01,288
Hail!

263
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:04,688
l don't like Ahtur either.

264
00:16:04,894 --> 00:16:08,853
Water for the horses!

265
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:15,163
Hunt your lion with that, nimrod.

266
00:16:15,371 --> 00:16:19,034
lf you killed the lion,
they'd call you great.

267
00:16:19,242 --> 00:16:20,266
l can bend their spears,

268
00:16:20,476 --> 00:16:21,738
But l can't outrun their horses.

269
00:16:21,944 --> 00:16:24,174
l could get you there first.

270
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,339
We have stables.

271
00:16:30,953 --> 00:16:33,183
What's your price?

272
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:37,348
Take me with you.

273
00:16:37,994 --> 00:16:40,428
You're a bold little monkey.

274
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:44,589
What's your name?

275
00:16:46,002 --> 00:16:48,971
Delilah.

276
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:55,077
Come on.

277
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:13,290
Faster, Samson, faster!

278
00:17:13,496 --> 00:17:14,656
Hold tight to the railing!

279
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:15,922
l'll hold tight to you!

280
00:17:16,132 --> 00:17:17,463
Be careful, you'll fall out!

281
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:19,134
No, l won't!

282
00:17:19,335 --> 00:17:21,929
Semadar doesn't love your strength
like l do.

283
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:25,232
l'd love to feel the power of your arms.

284
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:27,636
l'd rather feel a wildcat on my back!

285
00:17:27,844 --> 00:17:29,402
Will you tame me, Samson?

286
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:31,204
l'll use you for lion bait!

287
00:17:31,414 --> 00:17:35,373
l don't see any lion!

288
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:40,621
Aah!

289
00:17:40,823 --> 00:17:43,792
Whoa.

290
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,697
Kill him before they arrive.

291
00:17:55,905 --> 00:18:00,274
l won't need it. He's a young lion.

292
00:18:00,476 --> 00:18:03,445
Samson!

293
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:10,546
You're more trouble than...

294
00:18:10,753 --> 00:18:11,310
l'm afraid!

295
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:17,482
Get up on that rock and don't move.

296
00:18:25,101 --> 00:18:28,093
Look out!

297
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:21,279
Samson.
Samson!

298
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,440
You killed him with your hands.

299
00:20:22,652 --> 00:20:23,710
Oh, Samson.

300
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,413
Hey, one cat at a time.

301
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:30,990
What's the matter with you?

302
00:20:31,193 --> 00:20:31,659
l love you.

303
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:32,828
That's what's the matter with me...

304
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:35,998
l love you.

305
00:20:39,302 --> 00:20:42,237
Lion ho!

306
00:20:47,109 --> 00:20:48,235
Halt the hunt!

307
00:20:48,444 --> 00:20:52,403
The beast is slain.

308
00:21:02,658 --> 00:21:03,386
Delilah.

309
00:21:03,592 --> 00:21:05,389
Semadar, the saran.

310
00:21:05,594 --> 00:21:07,391
Who is this girl?

311
00:21:07,596 --> 00:21:09,427
My sister, lord saran.

312
00:21:09,632 --> 00:21:11,156
l don't know how she came here
with this...

313
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:13,062
Danite, isn't he?

314
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:16,830
Perhaps this blossom from Tubal's garden
can enlighten us.

315
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,836
Oh, yes, majesty, l can.

316
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,635
Samson killed the lion
with his bare hands.

317
00:21:21,844 --> 00:21:26,213
Never has there been such power
in any man.

318
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:31,944
Your sister has a lively imagination.

319
00:21:32,154 --> 00:21:36,454
So you're Samson,
the brawling troublemaker.

320
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:37,956
The saran knows me.

321
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,287
Yes, and no good of you.

322
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:43,965
Come here, girl.

323
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,293
You say he used no weapon?

324
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:48,299
Just his two hands, lord saran.

325
00:21:48,504 --> 00:21:50,495
He was magnificent.

326
00:21:50,706 --> 00:21:52,970
Only a god could do what he did.

327
00:21:53,175 --> 00:21:55,302
Well, Danite, you have one worshiper.

328
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:57,172
Ahtur, examine the beast.

329
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,575
Find the mark of the javelin.

330
00:21:59,782 --> 00:22:00,476
But l...

331
00:22:00,683 --> 00:22:06,644
Delilah, get down. Have you no respect?

332
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:15,295
There's no blood.

333
00:22:15,498 --> 00:22:17,728
They would must be on the other side.

334
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:21,528
The body's warm.

335
00:22:21,737 --> 00:22:23,637
There is no mark upon the skin.

336
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:26,069
What?

337
00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:30,006
l said there wasn't.

338
00:22:30,212 --> 00:22:33,181
No mark?

339
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:34,278
Would you have us believe

340
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:38,351
The beast dropped dead from fear?

341
00:22:38,587 --> 00:22:40,578
The girl told you the truth.

342
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,884
What you believe is your affair.

343
00:22:44,093 --> 00:22:46,857
l should like to see this strength.

344
00:22:47,062 --> 00:22:48,825
Garmiskar!

345
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:50,191
Now you'll see fur fly.

346
00:22:50,366 --> 00:22:56,305
You'll see some blood flow.

347
00:22:56,505 --> 00:22:59,133
Break this boaster's bones.

348
00:22:59,341 --> 00:23:00,069
l have no quarrel

349
00:23:00,276 --> 00:23:01,538
With your warrior.

350
00:23:01,744 --> 00:23:04,144
What kind of courage claims
to face a lion

351
00:23:04,346 --> 00:23:06,075
And fears my wrestler?

352
00:23:06,282 --> 00:23:10,616
Then man has done me no harm.

353
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,946
Fight him, Samson.

354
00:23:12,154 --> 00:23:15,123
Fight him.

355
00:23:22,898 --> 00:23:27,164
Like all boasters, he's a coward.

356
00:23:27,369 --> 00:23:33,330
Garmiskar...let him feel the whip.

357
00:23:35,878 --> 00:23:37,470
Now watch.

358
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,478
Heh heh heh.

359
00:23:40,683 --> 00:23:43,652
Oh!

360
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,559
Garmiskar's down!
Get up!

361
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:54,661
He's near 400 pounds.

362
00:23:54,864 --> 00:24:00,769
He threw him like a sack of grain.

363
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,459
The hunter's prize is yours.

364
00:24:24,393 --> 00:24:27,794
One ring for two lions.

365
00:24:27,997 --> 00:24:30,522
l would like to name my own prize.

366
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:32,291
Oh, yes?

367
00:24:32,468 --> 00:24:34,902
What would you have...

368
00:24:35,104 --> 00:24:37,470
My throne?

369
00:24:37,673 --> 00:24:40,039
l would take a philistine bride.

370
00:24:40,242 --> 00:24:42,972
The girl seems willing enough.

371
00:24:43,178 --> 00:24:43,940
l need men like you.

372
00:24:44,146 --> 00:24:45,738
lf a pretty face binds you to me,

373
00:24:45,948 --> 00:24:47,006
Yours request is granted.

374
00:24:47,216 --> 00:24:51,175
Choose your bride.

375
00:25:00,896 --> 00:25:03,228
This is the woman l take.

376
00:25:03,432 --> 00:25:06,026
But Semadar is promised to me.

377
00:25:06,235 --> 00:25:12,196
l have given my word, Ahtur.

378
00:25:15,177 --> 00:25:15,973
She is yours

379
00:25:16,178 --> 00:25:17,702
And 100 pieces of silver.

380
00:25:17,913 --> 00:25:19,778
You have given me a great treasure.

381
00:25:19,982 --> 00:25:23,383
Will you accept the lion's skin?

382
00:25:23,586 --> 00:25:24,518
As a peace offering,

383
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,281
From one prince to another.

384
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:28,956
ls it wise to have

385
00:25:29,158 --> 00:25:31,183
This mad dog in our city?

386
00:25:31,393 --> 00:25:36,387
He might be tamed in our city.

387
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:38,499
Lord saran,

388
00:25:38,701 --> 00:25:40,362
Samson could make no trouble

389
00:25:40,536 --> 00:25:43,027
lf Ahtur brought 30 of his warriors

390
00:25:43,238 --> 00:25:45,604
To the wedding feast.

391
00:25:45,808 --> 00:25:47,503
This girl has the wisdom of a serpent.

392
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,543
Ride home together and discuss
the choice of wedding companions.

393
00:25:50,746 --> 00:25:52,338
Hunt home!

394
00:25:52,548 --> 00:25:55,517
Hunt home!

395
00:26:15,537 --> 00:26:20,236
Look! The feather Dance!

396
00:26:20,442 --> 00:26:21,238
Feather against sword.

397
00:26:21,443 --> 00:26:24,571
Feather always wins.

398
00:26:24,813 --> 00:26:30,774
lt's nothing more than a witch's trick.

399
00:26:32,354 --> 00:26:33,378
No man can kill a lion

400
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:35,079
With his bare hands.

401
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,314
Who saw him kill the beast?

402
00:26:36,525 --> 00:26:42,486
You saw him throw Garmiskar.

403
00:26:45,668 --> 00:26:48,034
Why aren't you entertaining
the wedding guests?

404
00:26:48,237 --> 00:26:51,206
They hate him.

405
00:26:53,175 --> 00:26:54,802
Because he's a Danite?

406
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,740
Because he's a fool.

407
00:26:57,946 --> 00:27:00,744
Most man are, Delilah.

408
00:27:00,949 --> 00:27:05,079
There is nothing you can do about it.

409
00:27:05,287 --> 00:27:11,248
Sometimes a bee can move an ox.

410
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:17,831
A man shouldn't have to reach
at his own wedding feast.

411
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:20,501
The most desirable grapes

412
00:27:20,703 --> 00:27:23,638
Not if you reach high enough.

413
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,966
You waited too long, Ahtur.

414
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:27,335
For what?

415
00:27:27,543 --> 00:27:29,306
Entertainment.

416
00:27:29,511 --> 00:27:31,206
What will you choose?
Wine...

417
00:27:31,413 --> 00:27:33,142
Beauty...
Song?

418
00:27:33,348 --> 00:27:35,009
l have wine.

419
00:27:35,217 --> 00:27:37,378
You have beauty.

420
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:39,986
And Samson has a voice.

421
00:27:40,189 --> 00:27:45,559
Sing us one of your shepherd songs,
Samson.

422
00:27:45,761 --> 00:27:46,785
My singing sounds more like

423
00:27:46,995 --> 00:27:51,955
The bleating of my sheep.

424
00:27:53,168 --> 00:27:55,159
But l will set you a riddle.

425
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,531
Can he make one?

426
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,934
Speak up, strong man!

427
00:27:59,141 --> 00:27:59,732
l didn't know he could.

428
00:27:59,942 --> 00:28:00,670
What riddle?

429
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:03,639
Tell us.

430
00:28:03,846 --> 00:28:09,011
Out of the eater came forth meat.

431
00:28:09,218 --> 00:28:13,052
Out of the strong came forth sweetness.

432
00:28:13,255 --> 00:28:17,624
Out of the eater came forth...

433
00:28:17,826 --> 00:28:20,294
That's a fool's riddle.

434
00:28:20,496 --> 00:28:23,021
Then answer it.

435
00:28:23,232 --> 00:28:24,290
There's no sense to it.

436
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,331
Sweetness from the strong?

437
00:28:26,535 --> 00:28:27,695
He's twisting words.

438
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:30,666
Why, by the seven planets,

439
00:28:30,873 --> 00:28:32,397
That's no riddle at all.

440
00:28:32,608 --> 00:28:34,599
lt's not a riddle without a wager.

441
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,107
Or without gold.

442
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:39,405
What gold can Samson wager?

443
00:28:39,615 --> 00:28:42,584
There are many kinds of gold.

444
00:28:42,785 --> 00:28:44,719
There is the gold in Semadar's hair.

445
00:28:44,953 --> 00:28:48,218
But we won't wager that.

446
00:28:48,423 --> 00:28:51,221
There is the gold thread of a cloak.

447
00:28:51,426 --> 00:28:53,121
That l will wager.

448
00:28:53,328 --> 00:28:53,851
lf you guess the riddle,

449
00:28:54,062 --> 00:28:56,360
l'll pay each of you a new garment.

450
00:28:56,565 --> 00:28:58,294
All 30 of us?

451
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,592
All 30.

452
00:28:59,802 --> 00:29:00,700
30 garments?

453
00:29:00,903 --> 00:29:01,892
That's a heavy wager.

454
00:29:02,104 --> 00:29:03,093
How can he pay?

455
00:29:03,305 --> 00:29:05,398
With 30 lion skins?

456
00:29:05,607 --> 00:29:08,440
We'll get all shepherd cloaks.

457
00:29:08,644 --> 00:29:09,975
Where would he get 30 garments?

458
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:11,874
One for each of us!

459
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,978
Take care.

460
00:29:13,182 --> 00:29:15,446
Samson is clever at trapping foxes.

461
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:17,141
You may lose.

462
00:29:17,352 --> 00:29:20,446
Then we'll pay him a change of garments.

463
00:29:20,656 --> 00:29:21,748
All 30?

464
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,014
All 30.

465
00:29:23,225 --> 00:29:25,090
Agreed! lt's a wager!

466
00:29:25,294 --> 00:29:27,285
30 garments. lt's a bargain!

467
00:29:27,496 --> 00:29:28,656
Leave them with your riddle

468
00:29:28,864 --> 00:29:31,492
While l put on my wedding veil.

469
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,498
Out of the strong came forth sweetness.

470
00:29:34,703 --> 00:29:36,967
Hah! The fruit of the date palm!

471
00:29:37,172 --> 00:29:39,868
The tree is strong,
and the fruit is sweet.

472
00:29:40,075 --> 00:29:41,474
What do you feed date palms

473
00:29:41,677 --> 00:29:45,636
To make them eaters?

474
00:29:46,682 --> 00:29:50,015
Why it's a hawk's egg.
A hawk is an eater.

475
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:53,518
And the egg is strong.

476
00:29:53,722 --> 00:29:55,212
Find the answer before the wedding.

477
00:29:55,424 --> 00:29:58,860
Samson will have no time
for riddles afterwards.

478
00:29:59,061 --> 00:30:00,494
Father, take him,

479
00:30:00,696 --> 00:30:01,788
But bring him back to me.

480
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,292
l could not keep him away.

481
00:30:03,498 --> 00:30:04,692
You tried hard enough.

482
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:11,237
Musicians, play among the guests
while we prepare.

483
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,806
That scurvy riddle has no answer.

484
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:14,737
lt's a cheat!

485
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:16,342
lt's a Danite trick!

486
00:30:16,545 --> 00:30:18,308
Every riddle has an answer,

487
00:30:18,513 --> 00:30:20,981
Only you're too stupid to find it.

488
00:30:21,183 --> 00:30:23,242
Find it? Where?

489
00:30:23,452 --> 00:30:27,183
Not in your wine cup, Gammad.

490
00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:29,414
Sharpen your wits, not your teeth.

491
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:30,887
What?

492
00:30:31,093 --> 00:30:33,288
Don't you see Samson is laughing at you?

493
00:30:33,495 --> 00:30:34,257
Laughing?

494
00:30:34,463 --> 00:30:35,623
At us?

495
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:37,025
He's smarter than you.

496
00:30:37,232 --> 00:30:38,665
Has he told you the answer?

497
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:41,268
No, but...

498
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,165
l know someone who can get it.

499
00:30:43,372 --> 00:30:44,999
Who?

500
00:30:45,207 --> 00:30:46,697
Tell us.

501
00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:47,739
Semadar.

502
00:30:47,943 --> 00:30:49,433
Semadar?

503
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:51,272
Yes, by Dagon, she'll tell,

504
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,004
Or l'll wring the answer
from her throat.

505
00:30:53,215 --> 00:30:55,115
l'll pay no forfeit
to that Danite clown.

506
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:56,113
Oh, yes, you will.

507
00:30:56,318 --> 00:30:57,216
You made a wager.

508
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:00,911
Before l pay, l'll burn this house.

509
00:31:01,123 --> 00:31:02,613
You don't know Samson.

510
00:31:02,824 --> 00:31:04,917
Samson...

511
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:06,185
lt would be much safer

512
00:31:06,395 --> 00:31:09,364
lf Ahtur got the answer from Semadar.

513
00:31:09,564 --> 00:31:10,622
Yes. Semadar.

514
00:31:10,832 --> 00:31:12,732
Clever girl.

515
00:31:12,935 --> 00:31:18,874
Women always yield to Ahtur.

516
00:31:23,612 --> 00:31:24,306
Why should our guests

517
00:31:24,513 --> 00:31:27,073
Care about a stupid game of words?

518
00:31:27,282 --> 00:31:28,977
lt's no game to them.

519
00:31:29,184 --> 00:31:30,879
lt's Danite against philistine.

520
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:33,212
The wine has dulled their senses.

521
00:31:33,422 --> 00:31:35,788
lt hasn't dulled their anger.

522
00:31:35,991 --> 00:31:37,083
You're trying to frighten me

523
00:31:37,292 --> 00:31:38,759
Because you don't want me
to marry Samson.

524
00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:42,397
l don't want you to marry Samson,

525
00:31:42,597 --> 00:31:45,395
But there's hatred at
your wedding feast.

526
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,727
They think you've joined
Samson against us.

527
00:31:47,903 --> 00:31:49,803
But l haven't.

528
00:31:50,005 --> 00:31:51,097
Tell them l haven't.

529
00:31:51,306 --> 00:31:52,568
No.

530
00:31:52,774 --> 00:31:56,266
You tell them the answer to the riddle.

531
00:31:56,478 --> 00:31:58,309
But l don't know it.

532
00:31:58,513 --> 00:32:00,003
Unfortunate.

533
00:32:00,215 --> 00:32:03,343
Ahtur, Samson has told me nothing.

534
00:32:03,552 --> 00:32:04,917
Surely he'll share the answer

535
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,816
With so lovely a bride.

536
00:32:08,023 --> 00:32:09,217
But if he won't?

537
00:32:09,424 --> 00:32:10,413
Get it...

538
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:16,586
Or death may solve the Danite's riddle.

539
00:32:28,777 --> 00:32:30,005
l mean no more to you...

540
00:32:30,212 --> 00:32:31,804
Than those strangers down there.

541
00:32:32,014 --> 00:32:33,481
Semadar, don't cry.

542
00:32:33,682 --> 00:32:35,047
l can't stand tears.

543
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,683
You don't love me.

544
00:32:36,885 --> 00:32:37,909
But Semadar, look...

545
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,610
No! Go away.

546
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:42,085
l've told no one the answer.

547
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,655
Our wedding night...

548
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:45,884
And to you l am no one.

549
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:48,426
Women.

550
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:51,599
Won't you make me happy?

551
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,700
Tell me the riddle's answer.

552
00:32:53,902 --> 00:32:56,268
You could please me so much.

553
00:32:56,471 --> 00:32:58,336
lf a honeycomb pleases you,

554
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,508
A lion will not keep us apart.

555
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:02,108
Honeycomb!

556
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,971
ls that the answer?

557
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:06,579
Remember that lion l killed?

558
00:33:06,782 --> 00:33:09,307
The sun had bleached its bones,

559
00:33:09,518 --> 00:33:11,884
And wild bees had swarmed there.

560
00:33:12,087 --> 00:33:13,918
Oh, Samson!

561
00:33:14,122 --> 00:33:16,317
That was the honeycomb you brought me.

562
00:33:16,525 --> 00:33:17,992
What is sweeter than honey?

563
00:33:18,226 --> 00:33:24,187
What is stronger than a lion?

564
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:34,937
Semadar!

565
00:33:35,143 --> 00:33:36,940
What a beautiful bride!

566
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:39,340
Lucky Samson!

567
00:33:39,548 --> 00:33:40,708
Too good for a Danite!

568
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:42,679
Semadar, as pretty as a pearl!
Before this company,

569
00:33:42,884 --> 00:33:44,545
l give my daughter, Semadar,

570
00:33:44,753 --> 00:33:48,450
To Samson in marriage.

571
00:33:48,657 --> 00:33:49,316
Lucky Samson!

572
00:33:49,524 --> 00:33:53,221
What is sweeter than honey, Samson?

573
00:33:53,428 --> 00:33:55,726
Tell us....

574
00:33:55,931 --> 00:33:59,367
What is stronger than a lion?

575
00:33:59,568 --> 00:34:02,002
Ahtur has won the Danite's wager.

576
00:34:02,204 --> 00:34:06,163
Or the Danite's bride.

577
00:34:06,441 --> 00:34:07,499
A clever riddle.

578
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:08,903
Cleverly answered.

579
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:11,477
Now, Samson, take the wine cup.

580
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,545
Pay your wager, bridegroom.

581
00:34:13,748 --> 00:34:15,340
A change of garment for each!

582
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,482
Before we leave.

583
00:34:16,685 --> 00:34:18,346
A red cloak is what l want.

584
00:34:18,553 --> 00:34:20,714
So the wine spots don't show.

585
00:34:20,922 --> 00:34:22,219
A wool tunic for me

586
00:34:22,424 --> 00:34:24,756
To keep out the foul air of Dan.

587
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,257
Bring me an embroidered robe

588
00:34:26,461 --> 00:34:28,486
To dazzle the wenches.

589
00:34:28,697 --> 00:34:31,188
l'll settle for a cloak of silver.

590
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:34,232
lf you hadn't plowed with my heifer,

591
00:34:34,436 --> 00:34:36,904
You would not have answered my riddle.

592
00:34:37,072 --> 00:34:39,063
You're a bad loser, strong man.

593
00:34:39,307 --> 00:34:40,968
Pay your debt.

594
00:34:41,176 --> 00:34:43,406
l'll pay my debt.

595
00:34:43,612 --> 00:34:45,580
The same way you found the answer.

596
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,611
A red cloak is what l want.

597
00:34:47,816 --> 00:34:51,013
You'll get your red cloak.

598
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:52,743
You'll get your shirt of wool.

599
00:34:52,954 --> 00:34:54,319
With gold thread!

600
00:34:54,523 --> 00:34:56,218
And you, your silver cloak.

601
00:34:56,424 --> 00:34:59,621
You'll all be paid in full.

602
00:34:59,828 --> 00:35:03,286
You cheat before our wedding's done.

603
00:35:03,498 --> 00:35:06,092
The cats from the Timnath alleys

604
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:08,201
Could learn much from you.

605
00:35:08,403 --> 00:35:10,394
She stands with us.

606
00:35:10,605 --> 00:35:15,065
You'd do well to return to your people.

607
00:35:15,277 --> 00:35:18,110
l'll return.

608
00:35:18,313 --> 00:35:22,682
But first l must pay the debt
to your people.

609
00:35:22,884 --> 00:35:24,181
Or pay your wager.

610
00:35:24,386 --> 00:35:25,648
l'll be waiting for you.

611
00:35:25,854 --> 00:35:27,048
Samson!

612
00:35:27,255 --> 00:35:27,949
Samson!

613
00:35:28,123 --> 00:35:29,215
Let him go, father.

614
00:35:29,424 --> 00:35:30,948
But the saran gave her to Samson.

615
00:35:31,126 --> 00:35:34,095
Samson called her a cat
from the alleys of Timnath.

616
00:35:34,296 --> 00:35:37,060
This is terrible.
He doesn't want her now.

617
00:35:37,265 --> 00:35:39,324
But Ahtur does.

618
00:35:39,534 --> 00:35:40,193
Ahtur!

619
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:45,863
And the bridal chamber
is waiting for a bride.

620
00:35:46,241 --> 00:35:48,436
Good sense in that pretty head.

621
00:35:48,643 --> 00:35:51,203
Ahtur!

622
00:35:51,413 --> 00:35:57,249
The trouble you brew today,
you'll drink tomorrow.

623
00:35:57,452 --> 00:36:04,858
l'd rather be a merchant than
a captain of the fleet

624
00:36:05,927 --> 00:36:10,125
The saran owns a palace

625
00:36:10,332 --> 00:36:14,234
The jester owns an ass

626
00:36:14,436 --> 00:36:16,563
Oh!
Help!

627
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:18,329
Help!

628
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,632
Mercy!

629
00:36:19,841 --> 00:36:21,604
Help, god!

630
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:22,936
We've been robbed!

631
00:36:23,144 --> 00:36:23,610
A giant!

632
00:36:23,812 --> 00:36:25,006
Dagon, protect us!

633
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,169
He'll kill us!

634
00:36:26,381 --> 00:36:27,939
Thieves! Mercy!

635
00:36:28,149 --> 00:36:28,979
Thieves!

636
00:36:29,184 --> 00:36:31,311
Help!

637
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:33,248
Help! Help!

638
00:36:33,455 --> 00:36:35,582
Some demon fell upon me

639
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,052
And stole my best tunic.

640
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:37,884
A demon?

641
00:36:38,093 --> 00:36:38,991
Big as a camel...

642
00:36:39,194 --> 00:36:41,094
My clothes! My red cloak!

643
00:36:41,296 --> 00:36:41,955
They're gone!

644
00:36:42,163 --> 00:36:42,891
l can see that.

645
00:36:43,098 --> 00:36:45,293
A giant hurled me in the air...

646
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,092
l tried to fight him...

647
00:36:47,302 --> 00:36:48,326
Peace! Peace!

648
00:36:48,536 --> 00:36:49,764
Wait! Speak sense!

649
00:36:49,971 --> 00:36:51,905
My flowered robe...
lt's stolen.

650
00:36:52,107 --> 00:36:54,098
The one my wife made for me.

651
00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:54,866
She'll never believe me.

652
00:36:55,076 --> 00:36:56,407
l demand a search!

653
00:36:56,611 --> 00:36:57,600
My red cloak!

654
00:36:57,812 --> 00:37:00,337
My coat of silver cloth!

655
00:37:00,548 --> 00:37:04,780
We came for a wedding,
and we had a wedding.

656
00:37:04,986 --> 00:37:07,546
You're not leaving
before the Danite's paid his wager?

657
00:37:07,756 --> 00:37:09,656
His debt is as bad as his riddle.

658
00:37:09,858 --> 00:37:10,847
He won't come back.

659
00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:11,753
Oh, yes, he will.

660
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,090
l'll spit him like a fatted calf.

661
00:37:16,298 --> 00:37:18,198
There's your tunic with threads of gold.

662
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,961
Here's your fatted calf, Targil.

663
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:22,932
A red cloak,

664
00:37:23,138 --> 00:37:25,868
The color of your nose, Gammad.

665
00:37:26,074 --> 00:37:27,302
Here, Teresh.

666
00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:28,373
Wear this over your head,

667
00:37:28,576 --> 00:37:30,339
So the wenches can't see your face.

668
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:31,443
Hey! Wait!

669
00:37:31,646 --> 00:37:33,307
And you, Gergam,

670
00:37:33,515 --> 00:37:34,812
You want a silver cloak?

671
00:37:35,016 --> 00:37:39,043
Find it yourself,
there's 30 to choose from.

672
00:37:39,254 --> 00:37:42,087
Hey! Hey! Hey!

673
00:37:42,257 --> 00:37:44,725
Where did he get such garments?

674
00:37:44,926 --> 00:37:46,587
Now you're paid.

675
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:48,660
The lot of you.

676
00:37:48,863 --> 00:37:52,822
Where's Semadar?

677
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:55,729
Where's Semadar?

678
00:37:55,937 --> 00:37:57,199
Oh, wait, wait, Samson.

679
00:37:57,405 --> 00:37:58,064
Where's my wife?

680
00:37:58,273 --> 00:38:00,036
But she isn't yours. Your said...

681
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:01,868
Never mind what l said.

682
00:38:02,077 --> 00:38:04,409
You said you were done with her.

683
00:38:04,612 --> 00:38:05,476
l thought you hated her.

684
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,944
l gave her to Ahtur.

685
00:38:08,149 --> 00:38:10,379
You...Ahtur!

686
00:38:10,585 --> 00:38:11,984
He wanted to marry her.

687
00:38:12,187 --> 00:38:12,846
What could l do?

688
00:38:13,054 --> 00:38:15,249
You wanted no Danite for a son-in-law.

689
00:38:15,457 --> 00:38:17,448
Look! Here! Samson.

690
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:18,819
My other daughter.

691
00:38:19,027 --> 00:38:19,789
Take her.

692
00:38:19,994 --> 00:38:21,621
She'll make you a much better wife.

693
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,491
She's fairer than Semadar.

694
00:38:23,698 --> 00:38:25,689
Much, much more beautiful.

695
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,460
You give me a turnip for...

696
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,763
This one is a queen among women.

697
00:38:30,972 --> 00:38:34,464
Samson, look!
Have you ever seen eyes like that?

698
00:38:34,676 --> 00:38:36,200
So full of love for you?

699
00:38:36,411 --> 00:38:38,276
See the whiteness of her skin,

700
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,710
Smooth as a young dove's.

701
00:38:40,915 --> 00:38:42,974
She will grow into a rare blossom.

702
00:38:43,184 --> 00:38:44,981
She'll grow into a Thornbush.

703
00:38:45,186 --> 00:38:46,949
Did a Thornbush steal the chariot

704
00:38:47,155 --> 00:38:48,213
That took you to the lion?

705
00:38:48,423 --> 00:38:49,617
Did a Thornbush tell the saran

706
00:38:49,824 --> 00:38:51,724
How you killed it with your bare hands?

707
00:38:51,926 --> 00:38:52,984
No, l did.

708
00:38:53,194 --> 00:38:53,990
And he believed me.

709
00:38:54,195 --> 00:38:55,662
Then you chose Semadar.

710
00:38:55,864 --> 00:38:56,956
Take your claws out of me.

711
00:38:57,165 --> 00:38:58,632
You'll never get them out of you.

712
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:01,825
l made Ahtur steal the riddle's secret
from Semadar.

713
00:39:02,036 --> 00:39:05,631
l lied to stop you from marrying her.

714
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,331
You're the only thing
in the world l want.

715
00:39:08,576 --> 00:39:11,977
Hold this fork-tongued adder
before l step on her.

716
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,909
lf you crush the life out of me,

717
00:39:14,115 --> 00:39:16,413
l'll kiss you with my dying breath.

718
00:39:16,618 --> 00:39:20,418
You want me to marry this wild cat?

719
00:39:20,622 --> 00:39:22,351
Let him destroy himself!

720
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,557
Oh!

721
00:39:23,758 --> 00:39:26,158
Samson!

722
00:39:26,361 --> 00:39:32,322
You'll die for this, you fool!

723
00:39:41,376 --> 00:39:43,105
Look!
Ahtur is down!

724
00:39:43,311 --> 00:39:47,270
Give me a javelin!

725
00:39:48,817 --> 00:39:51,786
Let me out!

726
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,489
My Sword!

727
00:39:56,791 --> 00:39:58,918
He's not armed. Charge him!

728
00:39:59,127 --> 00:40:00,059
l'll split that shield!

729
00:40:00,261 --> 00:40:01,159
Semadar!

730
00:40:01,362 --> 00:40:03,159
Here's a thorn for his ribs.

731
00:40:03,364 --> 00:40:04,262
lnside, Semadar!

732
00:40:04,466 --> 00:40:06,593
Some, Samson, they'll kill us.

733
00:40:06,801 --> 00:40:09,736
Look out He's throwing.

734
00:40:09,938 --> 00:40:12,907
Lock shields!

735
00:40:13,975 --> 00:40:15,033
Death to her!

736
00:40:15,243 --> 00:40:16,938
No, Targil! Hide, Semadar. Hide!

737
00:40:17,145 --> 00:40:18,476
And death to her father!

738
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,806
Father

739
00:40:20,014 --> 00:40:21,174
Semadar! No!

740
00:40:21,382 --> 00:40:21,973
Targil!

741
00:40:22,183 --> 00:40:25,152
Aah!

742
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,229
My daughter!

743
00:40:36,397 --> 00:40:39,366
Burn her and her father

744
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:42,536
Carge him!

745
00:40:47,175 --> 00:40:49,040
He has the strength of hell.

746
00:40:49,244 --> 00:40:51,235
He'll bleed like any man!

747
00:40:51,446 --> 00:40:54,279
You came to this house
as wedding guests.

748
00:40:54,449 --> 00:40:58,215
Fire and death are your gifts
to my bride.

749
00:40:58,419 --> 00:41:01,547
For all that l do against you now,

750
00:41:01,756 --> 00:41:04,782
l shall be blameless.

751
00:41:04,993 --> 00:41:08,451
l'll give you back fire for fire!

752
00:41:08,663 --> 00:41:12,622
And death for death.

753
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:26,870
What invisible power
strikes through his arm?

754
00:41:42,096 --> 00:41:43,927
Turn away, little mistress.

755
00:41:44,132 --> 00:41:45,963
Don't look anymore.

756
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:52,629
All you have in the world
is ashes and death.

757
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,733
Samson lives.

758
00:41:55,944 --> 00:41:58,139
May his flesh rot from his bones.

759
00:41:58,346 --> 00:42:00,507
Be still, old fool.

760
00:42:00,715 --> 00:42:02,774
lf it takes all my life,

761
00:42:02,984 --> 00:42:06,511
l'll make him curse the day he was born.

762
00:42:06,721 --> 00:42:09,451
He called you a forked-tongue adder.

763
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:13,650
He's going to feel its sting.

764
00:42:13,861 --> 00:42:19,493
What strength can these hands
have against him?

765
00:42:19,701 --> 00:42:26,368
Perhaps greater than a lion's
and softer than a dove's.

766
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:30,102
l'll find strength, Hisham.

767
00:42:30,311 --> 00:42:35,271
Strength to destroy him.

768
00:42:38,252 --> 00:42:40,311
Samson! Samson! Samson!

769
00:42:40,521 --> 00:42:43,285
Every Danite sheepherder knows
where to find him,

770
00:42:43,491 --> 00:42:45,391
Yet the man's invisible.

771
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,223
l know the Danites worship
an invisible god, Ahtur,

772
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,295
But an invisible leader!

773
00:42:51,499 --> 00:42:54,434
l've wasted a year
chasing lies and rumors.

774
00:42:54,636 --> 00:42:56,763
l've flogged Danites,
hung them in chains,

775
00:42:56,971 --> 00:42:57,995
Burned them,

776
00:42:58,206 --> 00:42:59,571
But they won't give him up.

777
00:42:59,774 --> 00:43:03,005
Apparently they love Samson
more than they fear you.

778
00:43:03,211 --> 00:43:08,672
Give me 10,000 men,
and like all soldiers,

779
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:12,942
When you fail by the sword,
you ask for more swords.

780
00:43:13,154 --> 00:43:15,418
You should study the ant.

781
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,582
The ant?
Yes.

782
00:43:18,826 --> 00:43:21,659
The Babylonians called them Zerbabu.

783
00:43:21,863 --> 00:43:24,923
The Danites call them Nemalah.

784
00:43:25,133 --> 00:43:26,464
We call the ants.

785
00:43:26,668 --> 00:43:27,999
See how these master ants

786
00:43:28,202 --> 00:43:30,796
Collect food from their slaves.

787
00:43:31,005 --> 00:43:33,473
You might call them tax collectors.

788
00:43:33,675 --> 00:43:36,769
We need soldiers to destroy this Danite.

789
00:43:36,978 --> 00:43:39,606
You think so, Ahtur?

790
00:43:39,814 --> 00:43:41,441
l think one tax collector

791
00:43:41,616 --> 00:43:47,612
ls worth a thousand soldiers.

792
00:43:48,856 --> 00:43:50,221
A third of every herd.

793
00:43:50,425 --> 00:43:52,825
But our flocks mean our lives.

794
00:43:53,027 --> 00:43:54,892
Their skins clothe us.

795
00:43:55,096 --> 00:43:56,859
Their milk feeds our children.

796
00:43:57,065 --> 00:44:00,228
One out of three,
that's the saran's tax.

797
00:44:00,435 --> 00:44:01,561
We can't pay such a tax.

798
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:04,533
You'll pay it until you give us Samson

799
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:07,731
Tied up like this.

800
00:44:07,942 --> 00:44:10,308
And next time, l'll take your goats.

801
00:44:10,511 --> 00:44:14,470
Come on, soldier.

802
00:44:15,616 --> 00:44:17,811
No! No! Stop!

803
00:44:18,019 --> 00:44:21,352
You tax collectors feed on us
like vultures.

804
00:44:21,556 --> 00:44:23,649
l'll have nothing left to sell.

805
00:44:23,858 --> 00:44:26,088
Sell Samson to us, bound.

806
00:44:26,294 --> 00:44:27,818
Bind him?

807
00:44:28,029 --> 00:44:31,465
We can't even find him.

808
00:44:31,666 --> 00:44:34,260
You know where he is.

809
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:37,529
Barbers know all the gossip.

810
00:44:37,739 --> 00:44:38,728
My purse!

811
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,237
My purse!

812
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:44,070
We'll keep this
until you give up Samson.

813
00:44:44,278 --> 00:44:45,575
You'll get Samson...

814
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:51,741
When the light of the lord goes out.

815
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,561
You take even the light
by which we pray.

816
00:45:02,764 --> 00:45:04,857
You won't pray much longer,

817
00:45:05,066 --> 00:45:06,328
Unless you bring us Samson

818
00:45:06,534 --> 00:45:07,558
Out of the wilderness.

819
00:45:07,769 --> 00:45:10,966
He'll come back to drive you
from our land.

820
00:45:11,172 --> 00:45:13,436
Ti will be a hungry land.

821
00:45:13,641 --> 00:45:15,472
You can starve us with taxes,

822
00:45:15,676 --> 00:45:17,940
Strip our houses, plunder,
burn, and steal,

823
00:45:18,146 --> 00:45:19,374
But we'll never betray Samson.

824
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,377
One rock isn't a mountain, Miriam.

825
00:45:21,582 --> 00:45:23,777
One man is not a nation.

826
00:45:23,985 --> 00:45:26,647
Can Samson bring back the grain
to our fields

827
00:45:26,854 --> 00:45:29,186
By burning the philistine's fields?

828
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:30,982
Can Samson feed our children

829
00:45:31,192 --> 00:45:34,184
When they cry for food
with the gates of Gaza?

830
00:45:34,395 --> 00:45:36,625
He has done to the philistines
what they did to him.

831
00:45:36,831 --> 00:45:38,162
Who else has stood against them?

832
00:45:38,366 --> 00:45:40,926
He stood against them
for his philistine wife,

833
00:45:41,135 --> 00:45:44,366
Not for us.
His strength is our shield.

834
00:45:44,572 --> 00:45:46,039
He has not shielded us.

835
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,175
Must we all suffer for
what one man has done?

836
00:45:49,377 --> 00:45:50,708
We will never give him up.

837
00:45:50,912 --> 00:45:53,039
We'll bind him and deliver him

838
00:45:53,247 --> 00:45:59,208
lnto the hands of the philistines.

839
00:45:59,554 --> 00:46:01,715
You deliver him to death.

840
00:46:01,923 --> 00:46:04,653
While the strength
of the lord is in him,

841
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:07,885
No man can bind Samson.

842
00:46:08,095 --> 00:46:12,088
He will not raise his hand against us,
grandfather.

843
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,097
He will let himself be bound.

844
00:46:14,302 --> 00:46:16,395
Why will men always betray

845
00:46:16,604 --> 00:46:20,506
The strongest among them?

846
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:27,170
His name will be written
in the book of judges.

847
00:46:39,093 --> 00:46:41,084
Bellow, you blustering ox,

848
00:46:41,295 --> 00:46:47,256
So the saran can hear you in Gaza.

849
00:46:53,107 --> 00:46:59,569
Even a ruby loses luster
besides your lips.

850
00:47:01,749 --> 00:47:04,115
lt will take a sapphire
and an emerald together

851
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:10,279
To match your blue-green eyes.

852
00:47:11,025 --> 00:47:13,823
l have known the ways of many women

853
00:47:14,061 --> 00:47:17,292
Who fill the veins with fire...

854
00:47:17,498 --> 00:47:21,457
But only one Delilah.

855
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:24,634
My lord has given me many gifts,

856
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:27,433
But none more precious than his favor.

857
00:47:27,642 --> 00:47:29,610
Little mistress! Little mistress!

858
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:31,004
You're forbidden to disturb me

859
00:47:31,212 --> 00:47:33,180
When our lord of Gaza is here.

860
00:47:33,381 --> 00:47:35,315
lt's a messenger from the lord general.

861
00:47:35,516 --> 00:47:36,540
He says it mustn't wait!

862
00:47:36,751 --> 00:47:37,775
We'll see no one.

863
00:47:37,985 --> 00:47:41,614
Delilah, what a dimpled dragon
you can be,

864
00:47:41,822 --> 00:47:44,120
Flashing fire and smoke.

865
00:47:44,325 --> 00:47:46,156
But even your anger charms me

866
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,828
As long as it's directed
at someone else.

867
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:54,991
The poor Hisham. Let the man in.

868
00:48:00,675 --> 00:48:03,371
Majesty!
Speak

869
00:48:03,577 --> 00:48:04,441
Lord Ahtur,

870
00:48:04,645 --> 00:48:07,273
Military governor of Dan,
prince of Philistia,

871
00:48:07,481 --> 00:48:09,574
Sends greetings to the saran of Gaza,

872
00:48:09,784 --> 00:48:10,716
Majestic...

873
00:48:10,885 --> 00:48:11,943
Yes. Get on with the message.

874
00:48:12,153 --> 00:48:15,020
Samson is our prisoner.

875
00:48:15,222 --> 00:48:15,984
What have they done with him?

876
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:17,350
Would you mind if l asked?

877
00:48:17,558 --> 00:48:18,525
Pardon, but...

878
00:48:18,726 --> 00:48:21,661
l know, but just leave it to me.

879
00:48:21,862 --> 00:48:24,262
The lord Ahtur is leading Samson,

880
00:48:24,465 --> 00:48:25,557
Bound, toward Gaza.

881
00:48:25,766 --> 00:48:27,631
They're but a short distance away.

882
00:48:27,835 --> 00:48:29,393
l've waited a long time

883
00:48:29,603 --> 00:48:33,562
To hear those words.

884
00:48:33,975 --> 00:48:38,969
Such news deserves reward.

885
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:42,149
Withdraw.

886
00:48:43,718 --> 00:48:47,154
That was a very costly jewel.

887
00:48:47,355 --> 00:48:50,688
What will you do with Samson, my lord?

888
00:48:50,891 --> 00:48:52,916
Well, we might hang him by his heels

889
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,151
From your balcony.

890
00:48:55,363 --> 00:48:59,800
Or what would your suggestion be,
Delilah?

891
00:49:00,001 --> 00:49:01,628
Make him turn the gristmill,

892
00:49:01,836 --> 00:49:04,361
Whipped and driven like an animal,

893
00:49:04,572 --> 00:49:08,508
Where all Gaza can mock him
and laugh at him.

894
00:49:08,709 --> 00:49:09,607
Humble him.

895
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:11,209
Bring him to his knees.

896
00:49:11,412 --> 00:49:14,279
But l thought you once
admired this Danite.

897
00:49:14,482 --> 00:49:18,111
As l admire the gutter-rats of Gaza.

898
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:21,220
l'm jealous of your hatred.

899
00:49:21,422 --> 00:49:24,585
Don't share even that with anyone else.

900
00:49:24,792 --> 00:49:27,124
We'll chain this lion-killer
to the millstone

901
00:49:27,328 --> 00:49:29,489
lf that is your wish

902
00:49:29,697 --> 00:49:32,962
And perhaps arrange
a few other sports for him.

903
00:49:33,167 --> 00:49:34,156
Anything.

904
00:49:34,368 --> 00:49:40,329
Only let me be there to watch it.

905
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:59,591
Unconquerable leader of Danites,

906
00:49:59,794 --> 00:50:02,558
Defender of the invisible god.

907
00:50:02,763 --> 00:50:05,163
You're very silent, Samson.

908
00:50:05,366 --> 00:50:07,493
l thought you liked the company
of philistines.

909
00:50:07,701 --> 00:50:12,434
He prefers the company of an ass,
lord general.

910
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,834
They have much in common.

911
00:50:14,008 --> 00:50:16,704
An ass is wise enough
to obey his master.

912
00:50:16,911 --> 00:50:19,175
Your feet must be tired, Samson.

913
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:24,340
Why don't you try walking on your knees?

914
00:50:24,552 --> 00:50:25,951
Ho ho ho!

915
00:50:26,153 --> 00:50:29,122
Ha ha ha!

916
00:50:29,824 --> 00:50:32,725
Stand all, stand all!

917
00:50:32,927 --> 00:50:37,626
Water bearers, to the ranks.

918
00:50:37,832 --> 00:50:38,264
Ha ha ha!

919
00:50:38,466 --> 00:50:42,664
Ha ha ha!
Hee haw, hee haw!

920
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:44,770
Let us hear you pray, Samson.

921
00:50:44,972 --> 00:50:48,738
Hee haw, hee haw!

922
00:50:48,943 --> 00:50:52,208
l doubt if prayers would be
much help to him now.

923
00:50:52,413 --> 00:50:54,847
His real strength lies in riddles.

924
00:50:55,049 --> 00:50:56,539
Excellent, your excellence.

925
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:00,584
Riddles are the sport of fools.

926
00:51:00,788 --> 00:51:02,756
Then answer this one, Samson.

927
00:51:02,957 --> 00:51:07,485
Out of Dan came a killer of beasts.

928
00:51:07,695 --> 00:51:09,686
Whose head will pay for
his wedding feast?

929
00:51:09,897 --> 00:51:11,524
Ha ha!

930
00:51:11,732 --> 00:51:13,859
Has the pledge of my people
been fulfilled?

931
00:51:14,068 --> 00:51:17,595
Yes, but that's not the answer
to the riddle.

932
00:51:17,805 --> 00:51:19,966
Am l truly delivered into your hands?

933
00:51:20,174 --> 00:51:24,042
Truly as you're bound by rope.

934
00:51:24,245 --> 00:51:28,739
You seem to have lost
your skill for riddles.

935
00:51:28,949 --> 00:51:32,749
This is the place of Lehi.

936
00:51:32,953 --> 00:51:34,682
Even the sky speaks against him.

937
00:51:34,889 --> 00:51:36,447
Ha ha!

938
00:51:36,657 --> 00:51:40,218
O lord, my god, hear me.

939
00:51:40,427 --> 00:51:43,954
Gird me for battle against
the swords of my enemies.

940
00:51:44,165 --> 00:51:46,030
Forsake me not, o lord,

941
00:51:46,233 --> 00:51:47,894
But strengthen my arm

942
00:51:48,102 --> 00:51:51,799
To destroy the lions
who've scattered thy flocks.

943
00:51:52,006 --> 00:51:55,464
Oh, great skull, hear me.

944
00:51:55,676 --> 00:51:57,974
Hee haw. Hee haw!

945
00:51:58,179 --> 00:52:04,084
Let them see thy power, o god.

946
00:52:12,626 --> 00:52:17,120
They part like burning flax!

947
00:52:17,364 --> 00:52:18,695
His god has freed him!

948
00:52:18,899 --> 00:52:19,763
Quick! Take him!

949
00:52:19,967 --> 00:52:25,928
Alive if you can! Use chains!

950
00:52:42,156 --> 00:52:48,117
Lift it, you fools. My arm's pinned.

951
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:22,318
Son of the devil!

952
00:53:44,551 --> 00:53:47,918
Never did mortal man fight like this.

953
00:53:48,122 --> 00:53:49,589
His strength was greater

954
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:51,758
Than any instrument of war.

955
00:53:51,959 --> 00:53:54,427
And when he called upon his god,

956
00:53:54,628 --> 00:53:56,721
The thunder and the whirlwind
and the lightning

957
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:58,022
Were in his blows.

958
00:53:58,232 --> 00:54:00,598
A hundred killed, perhaps a thousand.

959
00:54:00,801 --> 00:54:03,964
There was no counting the slain.

960
00:54:04,171 --> 00:54:07,004
But what weapon had he?

961
00:54:07,207 --> 00:54:12,338
More shame to us...
The jawbone of an ass.

962
00:54:12,546 --> 00:54:14,241
A jester's toy?

963
00:54:14,448 --> 00:54:17,679
No sword of iron ever struck such blows.

964
00:54:17,885 --> 00:54:24,449
Men fell before him like wheat
before the scythe.

965
00:54:24,658 --> 00:54:25,249
Can this be? Who is this man?

966
00:54:25,459 --> 00:54:28,451
But had we no chariots to rid him down?

967
00:54:28,662 --> 00:54:31,222
He overturned chariots
with a single move.

968
00:54:31,432 --> 00:54:33,992
He fought within a gorge so narrow,

969
00:54:34,201 --> 00:54:36,499
We trampled on the dying to attack him.

970
00:54:36,704 --> 00:54:38,763
And those behind pressed forward.

971
00:54:38,972 --> 00:54:39,666
And those forward

972
00:54:39,873 --> 00:54:42,205
Were forced back upon
the blades behind them.

973
00:54:42,409 --> 00:54:46,175
My eyes have never seen
such a storm of death.

974
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:50,282
And now vultures circle over
Ramath-Lehi.

975
00:54:50,517 --> 00:54:52,542
And Samson...

976
00:54:52,753 --> 00:54:57,713
ln gone unto the hills.

977
00:55:00,527 --> 00:55:06,488
Take this fool and tend his wounds.

978
00:55:16,009 --> 00:55:18,375
Now where is the lord Ahtur?

979
00:55:18,579 --> 00:55:20,376
l am here, mighty saran.

980
00:55:20,581 --> 00:55:22,276
Mighty?

981
00:55:22,483 --> 00:55:24,781
ln what?

982
00:55:24,985 --> 00:55:26,782
Certainly not my army.

983
00:55:26,987 --> 00:55:30,423
Have you come to tell us
of your triumph?

984
00:55:30,624 --> 00:55:32,888
Your messenger has given us
a very thorough account.

985
00:55:33,093 --> 00:55:36,324
He told us how your warrior Zamath
charged like a lion,

986
00:55:36,563 --> 00:55:41,125
Only to have his skull crushed
like an egg through his helmet.

987
00:55:41,335 --> 00:55:44,498
And, uh, with what,

988
00:55:44,705 --> 00:55:48,141
High prince Ahtur?

989
00:55:48,342 --> 00:55:55,839
Tell this council the weapon
used against you.

990
00:55:56,049 --> 00:55:56,777
Well?

991
00:55:56,984 --> 00:55:58,349
Tell them.

992
00:55:58,585 --> 00:56:01,486
Speak.

993
00:56:01,688 --> 00:56:05,522
The jawbone of an ass.

994
00:56:05,726 --> 00:56:07,489
Lord Ahtur.

995
00:56:07,694 --> 00:56:09,855
Military governor of Dan,

996
00:56:10,063 --> 00:56:12,190
Price of Philistia,

997
00:56:12,366 --> 00:56:14,231
Hakim of armies...

998
00:56:14,435 --> 00:56:18,371
Beaten with the jawbone of an ass.

999
00:56:18,572 --> 00:56:22,303
Our armies, that scattered the Hittites,

1000
00:56:22,509 --> 00:56:24,739
That swept the amortizes before them,

1001
00:56:24,945 --> 00:56:26,003
That cut through Canaan

1002
00:56:26,213 --> 00:56:27,703
To conquer the circle of the earth,

1003
00:56:27,915 --> 00:56:31,078
Beaten with the jawbone of an ass.

1004
00:56:31,285 --> 00:56:36,746
Are you a solider
or a clown commanding fools?

1005
00:56:37,391 --> 00:56:39,586
What is the number of all the forces
at our command?

1006
00:56:39,793 --> 00:56:40,384
Of chariots,

1007
00:56:40,627 --> 00:56:43,357
600 heavy, 1 ,000 light.

1008
00:56:43,564 --> 00:56:43,893
Yes...

1009
00:56:44,097 --> 00:56:45,064
500 dromedaries of the swiftest.

1010
00:56:45,265 --> 00:56:45,629
Mm-hmm.

1011
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:48,393
2,000 horsemen,
without the palace guard.

1012
00:56:48,635 --> 00:56:51,502
3,000 heavy armored Searmen
of the elite.

1013
00:56:51,705 --> 00:56:52,672
8,000...

1014
00:56:52,873 --> 00:56:55,842
And we're beaten by the jawbone
of an ass.

1015
00:56:56,043 --> 00:56:57,670
Am l, lord of the five cities,

1016
00:56:57,878 --> 00:57:00,346
To be laughed at before the world

1017
00:57:00,547 --> 00:57:03,209
Before my subject peoples

1018
00:57:03,417 --> 00:57:06,079
Because a Danite herdsman
routs my armies?

1019
00:57:06,286 --> 00:57:08,117
Don't set that down, you fool.

1020
00:57:08,322 --> 00:57:10,790
Burns my crops, pillages caravans,

1021
00:57:10,991 --> 00:57:12,652
Even carries away the gates of my city!

1022
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:16,227
l requested 10,000 men
to crush these Danites forever.

1023
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:19,422
lnstead, you gave me tax collectors.

1024
00:57:19,633 --> 00:57:21,692
Taxes delivered Samson into your hands,

1025
00:57:21,902 --> 00:57:22,197
Didn't they?

1026
00:57:22,402 --> 00:57:23,426
You couldn't hold him.

1027
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:25,900
This Samson has some unknown power,

1028
00:57:26,106 --> 00:57:29,041
Some secret that gives him
superhuman strength.

1029
00:57:29,243 --> 00:57:31,006
No man can stand against him.

1030
00:57:31,211 --> 00:57:37,172
Perhaps he'll fall before a woman.

1031
00:57:39,586 --> 00:57:42,885
Even Samson's strength
must have a weakness.

1032
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:44,523
There isn't a man in the world

1033
00:57:44,725 --> 00:57:50,857
Who won't share his secrets
with some woman.

1034
00:57:51,064 --> 00:57:53,396
Most of us have shared
our gold with a woman.

1035
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,568
Ha ha ha!

1036
00:57:55,769 --> 00:57:58,101
More men have been trapped
by smiles than by rope.

1037
00:57:58,305 --> 00:58:01,365
Yes, you tried ropes, Ahtur.

1038
00:58:01,575 --> 00:58:04,669
Perhaps you should have smiled at him.

1039
00:58:04,878 --> 00:58:06,277
What is your plan, Delilah?

1040
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,004
Drive a tent peg through his head

1041
00:58:08,215 --> 00:58:09,944
Like Jael, the Canaanite?

1042
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:13,017
No, that was not my plan, lord Sharif.

1043
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:15,211
Delilah, do you know a woman

1044
00:58:15,422 --> 00:58:17,151
Who could entice this barbarian,

1045
00:58:17,357 --> 00:58:18,381
This killer?

1046
00:58:18,592 --> 00:58:22,028
Yes, my lords,
l can deliver Samson to you.

1047
00:58:22,262 --> 00:58:23,286
You, Delilah?

1048
00:58:23,497 --> 00:58:25,965
You capture Samson?
This devil?

1049
00:58:26,166 --> 00:58:27,064
Heaven protect her.

1050
00:58:27,267 --> 00:58:29,326
A dove against a bull.

1051
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,299
Bring in a woman,

1052
00:58:30,504 --> 00:58:32,062
And you'll bring in trouble.

1053
00:58:32,272 --> 00:58:34,206
Such devotion is very touching,

1054
00:58:34,408 --> 00:58:36,342
But what would you
gain from his capture?

1055
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:38,000
My lord's favor.

1056
00:58:38,211 --> 00:58:40,145
You have that. ls that all you want?

1057
00:58:40,347 --> 00:58:41,279
No.

1058
00:58:41,481 --> 00:58:43,312
Name your price, you shall have it.

1059
00:58:43,517 --> 00:58:44,779
Perhaps some little bauble

1060
00:58:44,985 --> 00:58:48,113
ln the street of jewelers?

1061
00:58:48,322 --> 00:58:50,984
You're very generous.

1062
00:58:51,191 --> 00:58:52,249
Tell me, Sohrab,

1063
00:58:52,459 --> 00:58:55,121
What value did you
set upon your last caravan

1064
00:58:55,329 --> 00:58:57,092
Samson raided near Gath?

1065
00:58:57,297 --> 00:58:59,595
1 ,100 pieces of silver.

1066
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,664
Here is the reckoning.

1067
00:59:00,867 --> 00:59:03,893
Then that is my price...
1 ,100 pieces of silver.

1068
00:59:04,104 --> 00:59:06,732
1 ,100? Your price is high.

1069
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:09,340
A pharaoh's ransom for a shepherd?

1070
00:59:09,543 --> 00:59:11,943
Betters silver than blood.

1071
00:59:12,145 --> 00:59:13,476
We'll pay it.

1072
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,275
1 ,100 pieces of silver from each of you.

1073
00:59:17,484 --> 00:59:18,815
What? What?

1074
00:59:19,019 --> 00:59:20,543
1 ,100!

1075
00:59:20,787 --> 00:59:23,756
1 ,100?

1076
00:59:25,125 --> 00:59:25,716
Stand aside, please.

1077
00:59:25,926 --> 00:59:27,018
1 ,100 pieces!

1078
00:59:27,227 --> 00:59:29,559
l know, but this must be recorded.

1079
00:59:29,796 --> 00:59:31,263
Silence!

1080
00:59:31,465 --> 00:59:33,695
Calm yourselves.

1081
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,993
You drive a sharp bargain, Delilah.

1082
00:59:36,203 --> 00:59:39,661
From you, my lord, l ask only a promise.

1083
00:59:39,873 --> 00:59:41,864
A promise for a promise?

1084
00:59:42,075 --> 00:59:43,804
What is yours?

1085
00:59:44,011 --> 00:59:48,641
To bring you Samson bound and helpless.

1086
00:59:48,849 --> 00:59:51,044
Bound by these white arms?

1087
00:59:51,251 --> 00:59:52,377
No.

1088
00:59:52,586 --> 00:59:55,316
Too high a price for me to pay.

1089
00:59:55,522 --> 00:59:58,218
My thoughts will be only of you.

1090
00:59:58,425 --> 01:00:00,256
l suggest the princess of Gaza

1091
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:02,655
Find some other way to capture Samson.

1092
01:00:02,863 --> 01:00:06,196
You've tried other ways.

1093
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,231
When my father and sister lay dead

1094
01:00:08,435 --> 01:00:11,871
ln the ashes of our home
because of Samson,

1095
01:00:12,072 --> 01:00:14,540
He laughed at my tears.

1096
01:00:14,741 --> 01:00:17,175
You cannot refuse me, my lord.

1097
01:00:17,377 --> 01:00:19,242
What promise do you ask?

1098
01:00:19,446 --> 01:00:22,938
l will learn the secret of his strength.

1099
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:27,450
But when he stands captive
and is weak as other men,

1100
01:00:27,621 --> 01:00:30,988
No drop of his blood shall be shed.

1101
01:00:31,191 --> 01:00:34,490
No blade shall touch his skin.

1102
01:00:34,695 --> 01:00:35,889
By the sacred pillars of the temple,

1103
01:00:36,096 --> 01:00:37,825
We demand his death!

1104
01:00:38,031 --> 01:00:41,091
l want his life.

1105
01:00:41,301 --> 01:00:42,768
Chain him in the gristmill.

1106
01:00:42,969 --> 01:00:45,529
Let him grind our grain like a beast.

1107
01:00:45,739 --> 01:00:48,264
Let the people mock him
and make sport of him

1108
01:00:48,475 --> 01:00:50,238
Until he draws his breath in agony

1109
01:00:50,444 --> 01:00:53,140
And every word is a prayer for death.

1110
01:00:53,346 --> 01:00:54,643
l'll pay price.

1111
01:00:54,881 --> 01:00:56,143
And l!

1112
01:00:56,349 --> 01:00:58,044
You'll get your silver
when we get Samson.

1113
01:00:58,251 --> 01:00:58,945
All Gaza will praise you.

1114
01:00:59,152 --> 01:01:02,383
lf you succeed,
no price will be too great.

1115
01:01:02,589 --> 01:01:06,548
The council is ended.

1116
01:01:08,562 --> 01:01:10,621
Think she can do it?

1117
01:01:10,831 --> 01:01:13,800
Delilah can.

1118
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:21,604
Well, Delilah, you have your price
and your promise.

1119
01:01:21,808 --> 01:01:24,276
My lord is the wisest of kings

1120
01:01:24,478 --> 01:01:27,811
And the greatest of men.

1121
01:01:28,014 --> 01:01:31,472
As a king, l have no choice.

1122
01:01:31,685 --> 01:01:33,175
As a man, l'm letting you leave

1123
01:01:33,386 --> 01:01:37,254
Because you want to.

1124
01:01:37,457 --> 01:01:38,424
King of my love,

1125
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:42,823
l go toe destroy your enemy...and mine.

1126
01:01:43,029 --> 01:01:45,020
Delilah, Delilah...

1127
01:01:45,232 --> 01:01:46,961
My love is only for you.

1128
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:49,499
Mmm.

1129
01:01:49,703 --> 01:01:51,796
A man who could stop the heart of a lion

1130
01:01:52,005 --> 01:01:55,532
Night stir the heart of a woman.

1131
01:01:55,709 --> 01:02:03,138
l will deliver Samson to you
before the month of harvest.

1132
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:33,679
Tab tah azi!

1133
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,852
Looks like a rich merchant.

1134
01:02:43,056 --> 01:02:49,962
Looks like a philistine plum,
ripe to pick.

1135
01:02:50,163 --> 01:02:51,027
Ride back.

1136
01:02:51,231 --> 01:02:52,892
Tell Ahtur to wait with his soldiers

1137
01:02:53,099 --> 01:02:54,760
By the scorpion's hill.

1138
01:02:55,001 --> 01:02:56,628
l'll camp in the valley of Sorek.

1139
01:02:56,837 --> 01:02:59,772
Yes, mistress.

1140
01:03:02,409 --> 01:03:07,506
They'll camp by the pool
at the temple ruins.

1141
01:03:07,714 --> 01:03:10,740
Why did the soldiers leave?

1142
01:03:10,951 --> 01:03:13,784
Maybe they're looking for us.

1143
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:16,887
Jebus will run off the camels
after dark,

1144
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:18,921
While we shear the owners.

1145
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:20,717
They might shear us.

1146
01:03:20,927 --> 01:03:22,986
Ha ha ha.

1147
01:03:23,196 --> 01:03:30,659
You worry more than my little mother.
Come on.

1148
01:04:45,445 --> 01:04:46,377
Don't cry out.

1149
01:04:46,579 --> 01:04:48,945
l won't.

1150
01:04:49,149 --> 01:04:53,108
Are you afraid?

1151
01:04:55,488 --> 01:04:57,479
Of a woman?

1152
01:04:57,691 --> 01:05:00,592
Yes.

1153
01:05:06,499 --> 01:05:10,458
Your caravan is rich.

1154
01:05:41,301 --> 01:05:44,998
Even sparrows don't travel this far
from their trade routes.

1155
01:05:45,205 --> 01:05:47,105
Why did you?

1156
01:05:47,307 --> 01:05:53,268
The jewel box is in that silver chest.

1157
01:06:04,557 --> 01:06:05,956
There's your husband?

1158
01:06:06,192 --> 01:06:10,151
l have no husband.

1159
01:06:16,536 --> 01:06:18,128
Then call your master.

1160
01:06:18,338 --> 01:06:21,535
l have no master.

1161
01:06:21,741 --> 01:06:24,335
The table's laid for two.

1162
01:06:24,544 --> 01:06:26,705
l'm expecting a caller.

1163
01:06:26,913 --> 01:06:28,881
Yes?

1164
01:06:29,082 --> 01:06:29,946
Who?

1165
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:33,119
You, Samson.

1166
01:06:45,932 --> 01:06:47,957
You know my name?

1167
01:06:48,168 --> 01:06:51,160
All Gaza knows your name.

1168
01:06:51,371 --> 01:06:54,169
They don't like it, l'm told.

1169
01:06:54,374 --> 01:06:56,433
They respected it

1170
01:06:56,643 --> 01:07:00,443
Before the mighty Samson
become a common robber.

1171
01:07:00,647 --> 01:07:06,108
And Delilah became
the great courtesan of Gaza.

1172
01:07:07,487 --> 01:07:09,512
l'm stupid, Samson,

1173
01:07:09,722 --> 01:07:12,987
To think l could deceive you.

1174
01:07:13,193 --> 01:07:17,152
Steal what you like.

1175
01:07:17,464 --> 01:07:19,125
This is not stealing.

1176
01:07:19,332 --> 01:07:20,890
These are taxes.

1177
01:07:21,101 --> 01:07:23,194
Your saran taxes us,

1178
01:07:23,403 --> 01:07:27,362
l tax the philistines.

1179
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:33,975
What pretty Danite girl
will wear these taxes?

1180
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:38,139
They'll buy armor.

1181
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:43,421
They'll buy armor to protect us
from philistine spears.

1182
01:07:43,623 --> 01:07:46,285
You need protection?

1183
01:07:46,493 --> 01:07:49,985
The woman that rules
the ruler of the five cities

1184
01:07:50,196 --> 01:07:55,156
Must have great wealth.

1185
01:07:57,270 --> 01:08:00,569
Where's the rest of it?

1186
01:08:00,773 --> 01:08:03,742
Not far away.

1187
01:08:08,214 --> 01:08:14,175
l will hide nothing from you.

1188
01:08:15,822 --> 01:08:18,791
The oldest trick in the world...

1189
01:08:18,992 --> 01:08:24,953
A silk trap baited with a woman.

1190
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:29,358
You know a better bait, Samson?

1191
01:08:29,569 --> 01:08:32,970
Men always respond.

1192
01:08:33,173 --> 01:08:34,936
Of all the women in Gaza,

1193
01:08:35,108 --> 01:08:37,269
Why did the saran send you?

1194
01:08:37,477 --> 01:08:40,537
l asked to come.

1195
01:08:40,747 --> 01:08:41,907
Why?

1196
01:08:42,115 --> 01:08:48,054
l knew you'd yield to any other woman.

1197
01:08:49,589 --> 01:08:52,854
And you came here to save me.

1198
01:08:53,059 --> 01:08:54,117
No.

1199
01:08:54,327 --> 01:08:58,286
l came to betray you.

1200
01:09:03,336 --> 01:09:08,797
By the four winds you
have courage, Delilah.

1201
01:09:10,743 --> 01:09:12,506
Don't overlook this.

1202
01:09:12,712 --> 01:09:17,115
lt's a gift from the saran.

1203
01:09:17,317 --> 01:09:19,114
You could bind a man tighter

1204
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:22,379
Than the saran's chains.

1205
01:09:22,589 --> 01:09:24,887
Could l bind you?

1206
01:09:25,091 --> 01:09:26,115
No, Delilah.

1207
01:09:26,326 --> 01:09:28,817
You're going back to the saran

1208
01:09:29,028 --> 01:09:30,859
The only way you can be trusted.

1209
01:09:31,064 --> 01:09:37,025
Oh? Will you kill me yourself?

1210
01:09:37,604 --> 01:09:42,007
You could crush me
between these two hands.

1211
01:09:42,175 --> 01:09:45,167
Why don't you?

1212
01:09:45,478 --> 01:09:50,177
l told you once l'd kiss you
with my dying breath.

1213
01:09:50,416 --> 01:09:55,718
Your kiss has the sting of death.

1214
01:09:55,922 --> 01:09:58,584
l don't believe you could kill me.

1215
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:01,760
Try.

1216
01:10:02,395 --> 01:10:06,491
You're afraid to kill me.

1217
01:10:06,699 --> 01:10:11,159
l'll let the devil do that.

1218
01:10:11,371 --> 01:10:13,430
l know you will,

1219
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:19,601
But don't make me eat supper alone.

1220
01:10:19,979 --> 01:10:22,948
Hisham.

1221
01:10:25,218 --> 01:10:27,846
l'll go back to Gaza at daylight.

1222
01:10:28,054 --> 01:10:31,956
You'll leave tonight.

1223
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:33,455
We're leaving, Hisham.

1224
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:35,423
Have the men load the camels.

1225
01:10:35,628 --> 01:10:36,788
What camels?

1226
01:10:36,996 --> 01:10:40,727
His bandits stole your camels.

1227
01:10:40,933 --> 01:10:43,493
Then have the drivers prepare a litter.

1228
01:10:43,703 --> 01:10:45,330
You have no drivers.

1229
01:10:45,538 --> 01:10:46,470
They ran to the hills

1230
01:10:46,673 --> 01:10:50,200
When they saw this spawn of the devil.

1231
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:52,537
How can l go, Samson?

1232
01:10:52,745 --> 01:10:55,213
l'll have your camels brought back.

1233
01:10:55,415 --> 01:10:58,111
Why not bring them yourself tomorrow?

1234
01:10:58,318 --> 01:10:59,717
Because when my back's turned,

1235
01:10:59,919 --> 01:11:02,547
You'll send for Ahtur's soldiers.

1236
01:11:02,755 --> 01:11:04,484
l couldn't send for anyone

1237
01:11:04,691 --> 01:11:08,650
lf you were with me.

1238
01:11:09,696 --> 01:11:12,790
Hisham, pour the wine.

1239
01:11:12,999 --> 01:11:16,162
Pour it for one,

1240
01:11:16,369 --> 01:11:18,894
Have you lost your taste for wine,
Samson?

1241
01:11:19,105 --> 01:11:21,232
l've got that l want.

1242
01:11:21,441 --> 01:11:25,400
You are all l want.

1243
01:11:27,513 --> 01:11:30,482
You...

1244
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:35,086
Daughter of hell.

1245
01:11:51,304 --> 01:11:54,967
Seven green witches for our seven days,
Samson.

1246
01:11:55,174 --> 01:11:58,007
Stop trying to be a fish!

1247
01:11:58,211 --> 01:11:59,576
Let me try them on you.

1248
01:11:59,779 --> 01:12:01,770
The last people who tried
drowning Danites

1249
01:12:01,981 --> 01:12:03,471
And up beneath the red sea.

1250
01:12:03,683 --> 01:12:09,644
Oh, Samson, that water's too wet!

1251
01:12:09,856 --> 01:12:15,817
Com up here and help me with these.

1252
01:12:16,629 --> 01:12:21,828
l have my hands full with you.

1253
01:12:22,034 --> 01:12:23,729
What do you want with those
green witches?

1254
01:12:23,936 --> 01:12:25,460
Planning to snare a rabbit?

1255
01:12:25,671 --> 01:12:28,640
No...a lion.

1256
01:12:28,975 --> 01:12:31,637
With those?

1257
01:12:31,844 --> 01:12:34,938
l'm weaving you a crown.

1258
01:12:35,148 --> 01:12:36,513
A lion with lilies in his mane?

1259
01:12:36,716 --> 01:12:38,013
Hold these.

1260
01:12:38,217 --> 01:12:42,244
This crown will have a secret power.

1261
01:12:42,455 --> 01:12:44,923
For its wearer or its weaver?

1262
01:12:45,124 --> 01:12:48,560
Only a secret can buy a secret.

1263
01:12:48,761 --> 01:12:51,195
l have no secrets left to tell.

1264
01:12:51,364 --> 01:12:53,229
No?

1265
01:12:53,433 --> 01:12:56,493
You never told me why you're stronger
than other men.

1266
01:12:56,702 --> 01:12:58,795
ls it some herb you mix in your food

1267
01:12:59,005 --> 01:13:06,377
Or some charmed oil you rub into
your body?

1268
01:13:07,246 --> 01:13:07,712
What would you do

1269
01:13:07,914 --> 01:13:11,475
lf you knew the secret of my strength?

1270
01:13:11,684 --> 01:13:14,278
Bind you.

1271
01:13:14,487 --> 01:13:16,580
Why?

1272
01:13:16,789 --> 01:13:21,385
So you could never leave me.

1273
01:13:21,627 --> 01:13:22,321
l couldn't escape you

1274
01:13:22,528 --> 01:13:27,090
lf you bound me with these seven
green reeds.

1275
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:31,532
Could seven little green witches hold
Samson?

1276
01:13:31,737 --> 01:13:34,865
These green witches are much stronger
than they look.

1277
01:13:35,074 --> 01:13:38,271
Hold them tight.

1278
01:13:38,478 --> 01:13:40,070
See?

1279
01:13:40,279 --> 01:13:42,645
lf you bound me with these seven
little witches,

1280
01:13:42,849 --> 01:13:44,817
l'd be weak like any other man.

1281
01:13:45,017 --> 01:13:46,484
Truly?

1282
01:13:46,686 --> 01:13:48,586
Try it.

1283
01:13:48,788 --> 01:13:52,315
Poor Samson, he'll be helpless,

1284
01:13:52,525 --> 01:13:53,719
Led on a leash,

1285
01:13:53,926 --> 01:13:55,723
The slave of a woman.

1286
01:13:55,928 --> 01:13:59,364
That knot there wouldn't hold a sparrow.

1287
01:13:59,565 --> 01:14:02,432
Tie it double.

1288
01:14:04,103 --> 01:14:09,040
Now you're my prisoner.

1289
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:15,046
Or are you mine?

1290
01:14:25,124 --> 01:14:31,063
Samson, the philistines are upon you.

1291
01:14:32,965 --> 01:14:35,934
Aah!

1292
01:14:43,009 --> 01:14:46,570
l ought to break this over your lying
little skull.

1293
01:14:46,779 --> 01:14:51,739
But it was a philistine.

1294
01:14:52,018 --> 01:14:54,748
You could teach the devil new tricks.

1295
01:14:54,954 --> 01:15:00,859
Well, you tried to cheat me.

1296
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:24,778
Delilah...

1297
01:15:24,984 --> 01:15:27,885
No, l will not listen.

1298
01:15:28,087 --> 01:15:28,678
But you asked me to...

1299
01:15:28,888 --> 01:15:31,322
l don't want to hear you.

1300
01:15:31,524 --> 01:15:34,049
Three times you plagued me to tell you.

1301
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:37,161
And three times you've lied to me.

1302
01:15:37,363 --> 01:15:40,059
You said new ropes that had never
been used

1303
01:15:40,266 --> 01:15:41,699
Would hold you.

1304
01:15:41,901 --> 01:15:44,836
Who knows the strength of a rope
that's never been us

1305
01:15:45,037 --> 01:15:47,130
Then you told me your strength
would go

1306
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:49,274
lf l wove your hair to the web
of my loom.

1307
01:15:49,475 --> 01:15:52,000
Now look at my loom.

1308
01:15:52,211 --> 01:15:55,476
l'd rather look at you.

1309
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:57,376
Oh! lt's no use, Samson.

1310
01:15:57,550 --> 01:16:01,077
You'll always find a new trick to
deceive me.

1311
01:16:01,287 --> 01:16:03,983
The night l came to the valley of Sorek,

1312
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:06,715
You wanted to send me away.

1313
01:16:06,926 --> 01:16:12,865
You were right. lt is better that l go.

1314
01:16:13,065 --> 01:16:16,034
Delilah.

1315
01:16:19,338 --> 01:16:21,932
Delilah...

1316
01:16:22,141 --> 01:16:24,302
Once your father offered you to me
in marriage.

1317
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:27,741
l remember what you called me.

1318
01:16:27,947 --> 01:16:31,405
Never mind what l said then.

1319
01:16:31,651 --> 01:16:35,587
Will you marry me now?

1320
01:16:38,758 --> 01:16:41,420
There are too many lies between us.

1321
01:16:41,594 --> 01:16:44,290
You still fear me more than you love me.

1322
01:16:44,497 --> 01:16:49,434
l don't fear you enough.

1323
01:16:49,702 --> 01:16:52,899
You don't trust me enough.

1324
01:16:53,105 --> 01:16:56,700
l love you enough.

1325
01:16:56,909 --> 01:16:58,900
Then...

1326
01:16:59,111 --> 01:17:02,774
Then tell me the secret
of your strength.

1327
01:17:02,982 --> 01:17:05,951
My strength?

1328
01:17:09,989 --> 01:17:10,455
My strength is...

1329
01:17:10,690 --> 01:17:13,124
No, Samson, no!

1330
01:17:13,325 --> 01:17:20,254
l don't want to be armed with a
weapon to destroy you

1331
01:17:20,466 --> 01:17:21,091
Weapon?

1332
01:17:27,506 --> 01:17:30,441
lt wouldn't be a weapon
if you really loved me.

1333
01:17:30,643 --> 01:17:33,237
Oh, Samson, Samson.

1334
01:17:33,446 --> 01:17:38,611
How can there be nay doubt left in you?

1335
01:17:38,818 --> 01:17:44,779
lf there is, l'll end it now.

1336
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:50,395
Look about you, Delilah.

1337
01:17:51,097 --> 01:17:55,557
The moon that lights this oasis by
night...

1338
01:17:55,768 --> 01:17:57,167
And the sun that lights it by day

1339
01:17:57,369 --> 01:18:00,736
Are not there by chance.

1340
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:03,465
ln the beginning,
there was only darkness,

1341
01:18:03,676 --> 01:18:06,440
Until one power created light

1342
01:18:06,645 --> 01:18:09,239
And shaped the earth and
all the things that live upo

1343
01:18:09,448 --> 01:18:11,848
Your invisible god.

1344
01:18:12,051 --> 01:18:14,042
My strength comes from him.

1345
01:18:14,253 --> 01:18:17,381
But how does his power reach you?

1346
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:20,423
ls he here with us now?

1347
01:18:20,626 --> 01:18:22,890
He's everywhere.

1348
01:18:23,095 --> 01:18:28,123
ln the wind, in the sea, in the fire.

1349
01:18:28,334 --> 01:18:32,270
ln your heart if you believe in him.

1350
01:18:32,471 --> 01:18:34,996
His is the only power in the world

1351
01:18:35,207 --> 01:18:37,402
That can break open a seed

1352
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:43,173
And raise it into that great tree.

1353
01:18:43,382 --> 01:18:47,318
And can l share this power with you?

1354
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,887
Anyone can share it.

1355
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:56,722
lt's a gift that makes men
greater than themselves.

1356
01:18:56,962 --> 01:19:01,558
With it, some can stir the
soul with music.

1357
01:19:01,734 --> 01:19:07,366
Others can read the truth
in men's hearts and forgive

1358
01:19:07,573 --> 01:19:10,133
To me, it's the strength
to break any bonds

1359
01:19:10,342 --> 01:19:11,866
That can be put upon me.

1360
01:19:12,077 --> 01:19:14,443
Will you always have this strength?

1361
01:19:14,647 --> 01:19:17,514
As long as l keep faith
with the almighty.

1362
01:19:17,716 --> 01:19:22,016
A long time ago, l was dedicated to him.

1363
01:19:22,221 --> 01:19:24,746
Many of the vows l've broken,

1364
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:26,981
But one l've kept.

1365
01:19:27,193 --> 01:19:29,491
A vow has made you strong?

1366
01:19:29,695 --> 01:19:34,826
Oh, it's much more than that.

1367
01:19:35,034 --> 01:19:37,867
Do you remember the lion l killed?

1368
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:40,732
l'll never forget.

1369
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:44,501
The strength of the lion makes
him king of beasts.

1370
01:19:44,710 --> 01:19:46,541
The great ruff of his mane

1371
01:19:46,745 --> 01:19:48,906
ls the mark of his power.

1372
01:19:49,114 --> 01:19:50,979
Go on, Samson.

1373
01:19:51,183 --> 01:19:51,774
Men of the desert

1374
01:19:51,984 --> 01:19:54,851
Know that the long flowing mane
of the stallion

1375
01:19:55,054 --> 01:19:58,581
ls the mark of his power.

1376
01:19:58,791 --> 01:20:00,656
Among my people,

1377
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:05,456
They say that the strongest ram
has the heaviest wool

1378
01:20:05,664 --> 01:20:08,098
But clip the mark of his power...

1379
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:11,531
Shear him, and he becomes a thing
to laugh at.

1380
01:20:11,737 --> 01:20:15,503
The shield of his strength is gone.

1381
01:20:15,708 --> 01:20:18,802
You've seen the eagle climb the sky.

1382
01:20:19,011 --> 01:20:20,706
But pluck the two prime feathers

1383
01:20:20,913 --> 01:20:23,177
From the tip of one wing,

1384
01:20:23,382 --> 01:20:26,112
And the mighty eagle can no longer fly.

1385
01:20:26,318 --> 01:20:30,049
The mark of his power is gone.

1386
01:20:30,256 --> 01:20:34,192
The mark of his power.

1387
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:37,429
Samson.

1388
01:20:38,063 --> 01:20:41,089
This is the mark of your power.

1389
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:42,824
lt's your hair.

1390
01:20:43,068 --> 01:20:46,970
lf it were shorn from your head...

1391
01:20:47,172 --> 01:20:50,198
l'd be as weak as any other man.

1392
01:20:50,409 --> 01:20:52,900
You believe that this great god of yours

1393
01:20:53,112 --> 01:20:56,479
Has given you your power through
your hair?

1394
01:20:56,682 --> 01:20:59,810
You do believe that, don't you?

1395
01:21:00,019 --> 01:21:03,352
From the beginning, my mother
taught me so.

1396
01:21:03,555 --> 01:21:06,353
Your power is in your hair.

1397
01:21:06,558 --> 01:21:10,392
What a beautiful power it is.

1398
01:21:10,596 --> 01:21:13,724
Look how it curls around my finger.

1399
01:21:13,933 --> 01:21:16,868
Black as a raven's wing

1400
01:21:17,069 --> 01:21:20,698
And wild as a storm.

1401
01:21:20,873 --> 01:21:25,867
Shall l pull it out and steal your
power?

1402
01:21:26,078 --> 01:21:27,705
You cannot steal...

1403
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:31,873
What's yours already.

1404
01:21:34,353 --> 01:21:36,548
Come with me to Egypt.

1405
01:21:36,755 --> 01:21:39,451
We'll not be Danite and philistine
there.

1406
01:21:39,658 --> 01:21:43,059
Only Samson and Delilah.

1407
01:21:43,262 --> 01:21:44,456
ln the valley of the Nile,

1408
01:21:44,663 --> 01:21:47,188
The air will be sweet with myrrh,

1409
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:52,564
And only the flight of the ibis
will darken the sky.

1410
01:21:52,771 --> 01:21:55,763
Will you come with me?

1411
01:21:55,975 --> 01:22:00,071
My eyes could never find more beauty

1412
01:22:00,279 --> 01:22:03,737
Than they see in you.

1413
01:22:03,983 --> 01:22:05,109
Through all eternity,

1414
01:22:05,317 --> 01:22:11,278
Nothing can ever take you out of
my arms.

1415
01:22:16,929 --> 01:22:19,921
Samson.

1416
01:22:20,833 --> 01:22:23,802
Miriam.

1417
01:22:25,004 --> 01:22:26,266
Saul.

1418
01:22:26,472 --> 01:22:28,633
Miriam, you bring bad news?

1419
01:22:28,841 --> 01:22:30,706
Let me talk with you alone.

1420
01:22:30,909 --> 01:22:32,536
Saul, fill the water bottle.

1421
01:22:32,745 --> 01:22:35,714
ln the tent.

1422
01:22:50,396 --> 01:22:52,091
How did you leave my mother?

1423
01:22:52,297 --> 01:22:55,323
Chained to a post and whipped.

1424
01:22:55,534 --> 01:22:59,470
Philistine swine.

1425
01:23:00,172 --> 01:23:02,037
Here.

1426
01:23:02,241 --> 01:23:03,469
My father?

1427
01:23:03,675 --> 01:23:06,644
Stoned.

1428
01:23:09,314 --> 01:23:12,181
They are killing and burning
in every village.

1429
01:23:12,384 --> 01:23:13,646
The firstborn in every home

1430
01:23:13,852 --> 01:23:15,649
ls put to the sword.

1431
01:23:15,854 --> 01:23:17,082
While this woman of Sorek

1432
01:23:17,289 --> 01:23:18,381
Makes you drunk with her kisses,

1433
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:22,321
The philistines murder your people.

1434
01:23:22,528 --> 01:23:25,622
You are falling into Ahtur's net,
Samson.

1435
01:23:25,831 --> 01:23:27,526
The philistines strike against
your people

1436
01:23:27,733 --> 01:23:28,256
To get you.

1437
01:23:28,467 --> 01:23:32,563
Your mother cries your name, Samson.

1438
01:23:32,771 --> 01:23:33,669
We'll go.

1439
01:23:33,872 --> 01:23:35,305
l'll saddle a beast for you to ride.

1440
01:23:35,507 --> 01:23:37,338
Don't go, Samson.

1441
01:23:37,543 --> 01:23:39,636
This milk-faced girl with her cow's eyes

1442
01:23:39,845 --> 01:23:45,784
Will lead you to your death.

1443
01:23:47,186 --> 01:23:48,847
You love him.

1444
01:23:49,021 --> 01:23:51,251
Women cannot deceive each other.

1445
01:23:51,457 --> 01:23:53,789
lt is in your face when you look at him.

1446
01:23:53,992 --> 01:23:59,225
You want him for yourself.

1447
01:23:59,431 --> 01:24:01,899
Yes, l love him.

1448
01:24:02,101 --> 01:24:05,832
ln his face, l see all that is
strong and good.

1449
01:24:06,038 --> 01:24:11,032
His name is like a cry of hope for us.

1450
01:24:11,276 --> 01:24:15,713
l've dreamed that someday Samson
would take me for hi

1451
01:24:15,914 --> 01:24:18,439
But he's never looked upon me as a
woman.

1452
01:24:18,650 --> 01:24:21,175
His face...his name...

1453
01:24:21,386 --> 01:24:22,910
Shadows on the wall.

1454
01:24:23,122 --> 01:24:25,147
You think that is love?

1455
01:24:25,357 --> 01:24:28,326
You worship him with prayers and
downcast eyes.

1456
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:32,860
l love him as a man of flesh and blood.

1457
01:24:33,065 --> 01:24:37,502
He is not leaving you for me.

1458
01:24:37,703 --> 01:24:39,534
There is a higher voice that speaks
through him,

1459
01:24:39,738 --> 01:24:42,366
And he will always answer its call.

1460
01:24:42,574 --> 01:24:46,670
Even your treacherous beauty cannot
turn him from it.

1461
01:24:46,879 --> 01:24:49,609
l cannot fight against his god...

1462
01:24:49,815 --> 01:24:55,082
But no woman will take him from me.

1463
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:58,289
Miriam.

1464
01:25:05,864 --> 01:25:08,833
Hisham!

1465
01:25:09,868 --> 01:25:12,837
Hisham.

1466
01:25:52,878 --> 01:25:55,346
Hisham.

1467
01:25:55,547 --> 01:25:58,516
Play music.

1468
01:25:59,418 --> 01:26:00,112
Water bottles filled?

1469
01:26:00,252 --> 01:26:00,877
Yes, Samson.

1470
01:26:01,086 --> 01:26:01,415
Come on.

1471
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:04,487
Samson.

1472
01:26:04,690 --> 01:26:07,215
Samson, don't turn back.

1473
01:26:07,426 --> 01:26:08,950
Samson.

1474
01:26:09,161 --> 01:26:11,686
Go on with Saul. l'll overtake you.

1475
01:26:11,897 --> 01:26:14,866
Aw, Samson.

1476
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,132
Don't worry, Miriam.

1477
01:26:23,342 --> 01:26:27,278
He'll keep his word.

1478
01:26:30,616 --> 01:26:32,243
You called?

1479
01:26:32,451 --> 01:26:35,352
The wine of parting is bitter, Samson.

1480
01:26:35,554 --> 01:26:37,283
Not as bitter as blood.

1481
01:26:37,489 --> 01:26:39,957
You cannot wipe away such love as
l have given you

1482
01:26:40,192 --> 01:26:42,558
Without even a farewell.

1483
01:26:42,761 --> 01:26:45,992
l have a new debt to pay the
philistines.

1484
01:26:46,198 --> 01:26:47,358
Then l'll come to you in Egypt.

1485
01:26:47,566 --> 01:26:51,866
No, Samson. l've lost you.

1486
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:56,006
Drain this cup...

1487
01:26:58,744 --> 01:27:04,649
As you have drained my heart.

1488
01:27:27,339 --> 01:27:30,206
You always doubt me, don't you?

1489
01:27:30,409 --> 01:27:34,345
And always love you.

1490
01:27:40,652 --> 01:27:44,088
l'll find you, Delilah, wherever you go.

1491
01:27:44,256 --> 01:27:45,621
No, Samson.

1492
01:27:45,824 --> 01:27:47,382
You belong to Miriam.

1493
01:27:47,592 --> 01:27:49,617
She's the good in you.

1494
01:27:49,828 --> 01:27:51,489
l'm the weakness...

1495
01:27:51,697 --> 01:27:57,397
The love that would enslave you.

1496
01:27:57,602 --> 01:28:03,507
l'll never be free of you, Delilah.

1497
01:28:10,515 --> 01:28:14,645
Let me feel the strength of your
arms about me.

1498
01:28:14,853 --> 01:28:18,584
When you are gone,
my arms will be empty.

1499
01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:23,727
My world will be empty.

1500
01:28:40,579 --> 01:28:44,015
Tell lord Ahtur's messenger...

1501
01:28:44,216 --> 01:28:48,152
l have the secret.

1502
01:29:46,111 --> 01:29:47,373
Samson.

1503
01:29:47,612 --> 01:29:50,308
Samson, the philistines are upon you.

1504
01:29:50,515 --> 01:29:51,880
l'll go out against them.

1505
01:29:52,083 --> 01:29:54,643
l'll...

1506
01:29:54,853 --> 01:29:56,320
Look at his hair, captain.

1507
01:29:56,555 --> 01:29:58,216
The lion of Dan is shorn like a sheep,

1508
01:29:58,390 --> 01:30:00,517
The lion? Without a mane?

1509
01:30:00,725 --> 01:30:02,192
Clean as a new-mown field.

1510
01:30:02,394 --> 01:30:06,125
She must've used a sickle on him.

1511
01:30:06,331 --> 01:30:07,798
Delilah plucked him like a chicken.

1512
01:30:08,033 --> 01:30:11,594
l've taken away your strength, Samson.

1513
01:30:11,803 --> 01:30:16,467
Your little Danite sparrow
will nest alone.

1514
01:30:16,675 --> 01:30:20,042
You philistine gutter rat.

1515
01:30:20,245 --> 01:30:20,643
Hey. Hey.

1516
01:30:20,846 --> 01:30:22,746
Throw your spears.

1517
01:30:22,948 --> 01:30:26,782
The shield of my god is gone from me.

1518
01:30:26,985 --> 01:30:29,283
What do you fear?

1519
01:30:29,488 --> 01:30:32,924
My blood will flow as red as yours.

1520
01:30:33,124 --> 01:30:34,489
All Gaza will honor the man

1521
01:30:34,693 --> 01:30:36,183
Who brings back my head.

1522
01:30:36,428 --> 01:30:38,692
We won't kill you.

1523
01:30:38,897 --> 01:30:40,728
You Danites need a living reminder

1524
01:30:40,932 --> 01:30:42,399
Of the price of revolt.

1525
01:30:42,634 --> 01:30:45,603
Bind him.

1526
01:30:46,271 --> 01:30:49,638
Call on your god, Samson.

1527
01:30:49,841 --> 01:30:51,934
l've betrayed him.

1528
01:30:52,143 --> 01:30:54,111
He would not hear me.

1529
01:30:54,312 --> 01:30:57,281
Are you not stronger than a hundred men?

1530
01:30:57,449 --> 01:31:00,350
You cannot carry away the gates of
Gaza again.

1531
01:31:00,552 --> 01:31:02,179
You cannot kill a lion now.

1532
01:31:02,387 --> 01:31:04,878
You're weak as any other man.

1533
01:31:05,123 --> 01:31:11,062
Stand him against that pole.

1534
01:31:12,931 --> 01:31:16,059
Hisham, we leave for Gaza.

1535
01:31:16,268 --> 01:31:18,361
You've done well, Delilah.

1536
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:20,538
No blade shall touch his skin.

1537
01:31:20,739 --> 01:31:22,730
No drop of his blood shall be shed.

1538
01:31:22,941 --> 01:31:25,739
Courier. Take word to the lord of
the five cities

1539
01:31:25,944 --> 01:31:27,434
That Delilah has kept her bargain.

1540
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:29,146
Yes, my lord,

1541
01:31:29,381 --> 01:31:32,817
The princes of Gaza will keep theirs.

1542
01:31:33,018 --> 01:31:34,849
You shall have your payment.

1543
01:31:35,053 --> 01:31:37,021
Payment.

1544
01:31:37,222 --> 01:31:39,747
Your arms were quicksand.

1545
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:42,426
Your kiss was death.

1546
01:31:42,627 --> 01:31:44,925
The name Delilah will be an
everlasting curse

1547
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:46,461
On the lips of men.

1548
01:31:46,665 --> 01:31:49,634
Bah.

1549
01:31:54,072 --> 01:31:56,040
l could have love you with a fire

1550
01:31:56,241 --> 01:31:59,039
To make all other loves seem like ice.

1551
01:31:59,244 --> 01:32:01,007
l would have gone with you to Egypt,

1552
01:32:01,212 --> 01:32:02,509
Left everything behind,

1553
01:32:02,714 --> 01:32:05,114
Lived only for you.

1554
01:32:05,317 --> 01:32:09,481
But one call from the milk-faced
Danite lily,

1555
01:32:09,688 --> 01:32:15,126
And you run whining at her heels.

1556
01:32:15,327 --> 01:32:19,263
No man leaves Delilah.

1557
01:32:22,834 --> 01:32:24,165
Look at her, Samson.

1558
01:32:24,369 --> 01:32:28,271
Look well and remember the perfume
of her hair,

1559
01:32:28,473 --> 01:32:30,338
The softness of her lips,

1560
01:32:30,542 --> 01:32:33,010
The fire of her embrace.

1561
01:32:33,244 --> 01:32:37,408
Satan himself taught her all the arts
of deception.

1562
01:32:37,616 --> 01:32:39,083
lt's easier to catch the moonlight

1563
01:32:39,284 --> 01:32:45,223
Than to hold such a woman.

1564
01:32:45,724 --> 01:32:48,818
With all your strength,
you're a fool, Samson.

1565
01:32:49,027 --> 01:32:51,120
You trusted Delilah.

1566
01:32:51,329 --> 01:32:52,921
Remember her beauty

1567
01:32:53,131 --> 01:32:55,827
And never forget her treachery.

1568
01:32:56,034 --> 01:32:59,003
Burn her image into your memory, Samson.

1569
01:32:59,237 --> 01:33:05,107
She's the last thing you'll ever see.

1570
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:11,249
Bind his head to the pole.

1571
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,581
Set it here.

1572
01:33:17,822 --> 01:33:21,087
lf you cannot see us,
you cannot harm us.

1573
01:33:21,292 --> 01:33:23,886
lf l have no strength to fight you,

1574
01:33:24,095 --> 01:33:30,034
l will need no eyes to find you.

1575
01:33:44,449 --> 01:33:45,916
O lord...

1576
01:33:46,117 --> 01:33:48,585
My eyes did turn away from you

1577
01:33:48,787 --> 01:33:52,120
To look upon the flesh pots of
my enemies.

1578
01:33:52,323 --> 01:33:54,723
Now you take away my sight

1579
01:33:54,926 --> 01:33:58,760
That l may see again more clearly.

1580
01:33:58,963 --> 01:34:04,868
Blessed be the name of the lord.

1581
01:34:05,937 --> 01:34:11,876
Don't let the blade touch his skin.

1582
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:33,522
1 ,100.

1583
01:34:33,732 --> 01:34:36,599
1 ,100 pieces of silver and my gratitude.

1584
01:34:36,801 --> 01:34:39,235
You gratitude matches your generosity.

1585
01:34:39,437 --> 01:34:41,029
Thank you.
The blessing of Dagon.

1586
01:34:41,239 --> 01:34:42,672
l hope the count is correct.

1587
01:34:42,874 --> 01:34:45,843
Oh, it is, it is.

1588
01:34:46,077 --> 01:34:47,738
lf you still have the same shears,
Delilah,

1589
01:34:47,946 --> 01:34:50,506
My hair's rather long.

1590
01:34:50,682 --> 01:34:58,145
Sometime you might bait a trap for me,
Delilah.

1591
01:34:59,858 --> 01:35:02,952
Can you believe Samson's strength was
in his hair?

1592
01:35:03,161 --> 01:35:07,860
Wherever it was, he hasn't got it now.

1593
01:35:08,066 --> 01:35:10,432
Virtue is not often so well rewarded.

1594
01:35:10,635 --> 01:35:15,402
Hmm. My greatest reward was in serving
my king.

1595
01:35:15,607 --> 01:35:18,576
While you were learning the secret of
Samson's streng

1596
01:35:18,810 --> 01:35:21,370
Did he perhaps learn the secret of
your love?

1597
01:35:21,579 --> 01:35:25,515
Would l have betrayed him then?

1598
01:35:25,717 --> 01:35:29,118
Men have been betrayed by love.

1599
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:33,552
Love and hate are but two sides of
the same coin.

1600
01:35:33,725 --> 01:35:36,421
My thoughts were only of you.

1601
01:35:36,628 --> 01:35:41,361
No man with eyes could
resist you, Delilah.

1602
01:35:41,566 --> 01:35:44,262
But only a fool would trust you.

1603
01:35:44,469 --> 01:35:46,027
Why should you doubt me?

1604
01:35:46,237 --> 01:35:49,502
You've not seen Samson grinding
at the millstone?

1605
01:35:49,707 --> 01:35:52,073
No.

1606
01:35:52,277 --> 01:35:55,508
Then come to the prison house.

1607
01:35:55,713 --> 01:35:58,682
No.

1608
01:35:59,717 --> 01:36:03,175
Suppose we go together.

1609
01:36:03,421 --> 01:36:09,360
Garmiskar will guard your fortune.

1610
01:36:24,742 --> 01:36:28,678
Come on, come on!

1611
01:37:09,287 --> 01:37:12,381
Grindstone for you.
He's milling flour for her.

1612
01:37:12,590 --> 01:37:13,989
And for the lion killer,

1613
01:37:14,192 --> 01:37:16,490
Delilah's put a millstone
around his neck.

1614
01:37:16,694 --> 01:37:17,251
Grind his body with the grain!

1615
01:37:17,462 --> 01:37:18,986
Beat him with the jawbone of an ass!

1616
01:37:19,197 --> 01:37:23,566
He burned our crops! Hang him!

1617
01:37:23,768 --> 01:37:28,705
Behold the lion of Dan!

1618
01:37:29,474 --> 01:37:32,841
He's magnificent, even in chains.

1619
01:37:33,044 --> 01:37:34,841
Bend your back, you two-legged mule!

1620
01:37:35,046 --> 01:37:36,035
Make him sweat!

1621
01:37:36,281 --> 01:37:38,841
Break those chains, Danite!

1622
01:37:39,050 --> 01:37:41,314
Samson was tamed by a woman.

1623
01:37:41,519 --> 01:37:44,511
And probably worth it.

1624
01:37:44,756 --> 01:37:46,417
He sit looks strong as an ox.

1625
01:37:46,624 --> 01:37:48,592
He'd look a whole lot stronger

1626
01:37:48,826 --> 01:37:51,192
lf he hadn't met Delilah.

1627
01:37:51,396 --> 01:37:56,925
By their yelps, you'd think
the felled the lion

1628
01:37:57,135 --> 01:38:00,434
He has not dared to look at me.

1629
01:38:00,638 --> 01:38:03,971
He cannot see you.

1630
01:38:04,175 --> 01:38:08,111
l'll make him see me.

1631
01:38:45,016 --> 01:38:47,985
He's blind.

1632
01:38:50,421 --> 01:38:53,447
He can never see me again.

1633
01:38:53,658 --> 01:38:55,285
Does that disturb you?

1634
01:38:55,493 --> 01:38:57,927
l had your promise.

1635
01:38:58,129 --> 01:39:00,097
No blade has touched his skin.

1636
01:39:00,264 --> 01:39:01,822
No drop of his blood was shed.

1637
01:39:02,033 --> 01:39:06,436
You...you played with words
to rob him of his eyes.

1638
01:39:06,637 --> 01:39:10,869
lt was you who betrayed him, not l.

1639
01:39:11,075 --> 01:39:14,374
He was captive, in chains,

1640
01:39:14,579 --> 01:39:15,944
Yet the lord of the five cities

1641
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:18,512
Could not show him mercy?

1642
01:39:18,716 --> 01:39:22,675
Did you show him mercy, Delilah?

1643
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:26,686
You wanted vengeance.

1644
01:39:26,891 --> 01:39:29,860
You have it.

1645
01:39:30,361 --> 01:39:33,330
Majesty.

1646
01:39:39,837 --> 01:39:42,897
Your enemies fall at your feet.

1647
01:39:43,107 --> 01:39:46,076
Get up!

1648
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:53,416
Oh, let me leave!

1649
01:39:56,554 --> 01:39:59,284
Water.

1650
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:01,458
Water.

1651
01:40:01,692 --> 01:40:04,160
Here's your water.

1652
01:40:04,362 --> 01:40:05,226
Beg for it.

1653
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:06,590
Thirsty, Samson?

1654
01:40:06,798 --> 01:40:10,734
Let him drink from a trough!

1655
01:40:10,935 --> 01:40:11,867
Water.

1656
01:40:12,070 --> 01:40:18,009
Here's drink for a jackass.

1657
01:40:18,309 --> 01:40:21,278
How did you lose your hair, Samson?

1658
01:40:21,512 --> 01:40:23,002
Water.

1659
01:40:23,247 --> 01:40:25,647
Lap it up.

1660
01:40:25,850 --> 01:40:29,786
Now, turn that wheel.

1661
01:40:30,421 --> 01:40:33,481
l will not see him thirst.

1662
01:40:33,691 --> 01:40:37,627
Give him water.

1663
01:40:38,563 --> 01:40:39,757
There can be only one master

1664
01:40:39,964 --> 01:40:42,364
ln a kingdom or a woman's heart.

1665
01:40:42,567 --> 01:40:44,535
Until you saw him like this,

1666
01:40:44,769 --> 01:40:46,669
You could not forget him.

1667
01:40:46,871 --> 01:40:49,840
Forget him?

1668
01:40:50,408 --> 01:40:51,568
Here's your water.

1669
01:40:51,776 --> 01:40:53,300
Every cup of water,

1670
01:40:53,544 --> 01:40:54,841
Every morsel of food,

1671
01:40:55,046 --> 01:40:57,708
Must be guided into his hands.

1672
01:40:57,915 --> 01:41:00,213
The mighty Samson, betrayed by a woman.

1673
01:41:00,351 --> 01:41:01,113
No.

1674
01:41:01,319 --> 01:41:03,651
Blinded, ridiculed, pitied.

1675
01:41:03,855 --> 01:41:06,983
No, l did not blind him!

1676
01:41:07,191 --> 01:41:08,488
Are you going to be as big a fool

1677
01:41:08,693 --> 01:41:10,285
As you've made of him?

1678
01:41:10,495 --> 01:41:13,464
He'd kill you.

1679
01:41:22,039 --> 01:41:27,978
You cannot undo what has been done.

1680
01:42:08,319 --> 01:42:14,258
You cannot undo what has been done.

1681
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:24,968
My eyes could never find more beauty

1682
01:42:25,203 --> 01:42:28,297
Than they see in you.

1683
01:42:28,506 --> 01:42:31,236
You cannot undo what has been done.

1684
01:42:31,442 --> 01:42:34,411
l can! l can!

1685
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:42,352
Round and round,

1686
01:42:42,587 --> 01:42:45,055
Day after day,

1687
01:42:45,256 --> 01:42:46,883
Month after month.

1688
01:42:47,091 --> 01:42:50,788
He never stops!

1689
01:42:50,995 --> 01:42:58,424
l'm being crushed like the grain
beneath the stone.

1690
01:43:01,038 --> 01:43:05,475
This night must end sometime.

1691
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:10,647
O god of Samson, help me.

1692
01:43:21,359 --> 01:43:23,827
He said you are everywhere.

1693
01:43:24,061 --> 01:43:26,325
That you are almighty.

1694
01:43:26,530 --> 01:43:28,555
Hear me.

1695
01:43:28,766 --> 01:43:31,758
Give back the light to his eyes.

1696
01:43:32,003 --> 01:43:34,597
Take my sight for his.

1697
01:43:34,805 --> 01:43:38,241
O god of Samson...

1698
01:43:38,476 --> 01:43:41,445
Help me.

1699
01:43:53,891 --> 01:43:55,722
Last watch of the night.

1700
01:43:55,926 --> 01:43:57,416
All's quiet within the city gates.

1701
01:43:57,662 --> 01:44:03,567
Samson lies chained in the prison house.

1702
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:14,876
How long will your forget me, o lord?

1703
01:44:15,079 --> 01:44:19,516
How long will your hand be
set against me?

1704
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:22,218
l call out through the long nights,

1705
01:44:22,420 --> 01:44:26,618
But you do not hear me.

1706
01:44:26,824 --> 01:44:30,089
O lord, god of my fathers,

1707
01:44:30,261 --> 01:44:32,695
They called unto you and were delivered.

1708
01:44:32,897 --> 01:44:35,730
Do not forsake me, o lord.

1709
01:44:35,933 --> 01:44:39,266
Hisham, wait outside with the guard.

1710
01:44:39,470 --> 01:44:40,903
Let no one come in.

1711
01:44:41,105 --> 01:44:42,800
Don't go near him, mistress.

1712
01:44:43,007 --> 01:44:44,167
He'll tear you to pieces.

1713
01:44:44,375 --> 01:44:50,314
O lord, god of my fathers...

1714
01:44:52,016 --> 01:44:56,885
O lord, l'm despised by all men.

1715
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:59,283
They mock me,

1716
01:44:59,523 --> 01:45:03,459
Saying, ''he trust his god
to deliver him.''

1717
01:45:03,661 --> 01:45:06,755
You are my god.

1718
01:45:06,964 --> 01:45:09,432
Be not far from me,

1719
01:45:09,633 --> 01:45:13,729
For there is no other help.

1720
01:45:13,938 --> 01:45:17,499
My strength has melted like wax.

1721
01:45:17,708 --> 01:45:20,404
My heart is dry of hope.

1722
01:45:20,611 --> 01:45:23,079
l'm blinded and among enemies.

1723
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:27,216
O lord, o my strength,

1724
01:45:27,485 --> 01:45:31,421
Send me your sign.

1725
01:45:37,128 --> 01:45:38,254
Are you flesh and blood,

1726
01:45:38,462 --> 01:45:40,794
Or an angel of the lord?

1727
01:45:40,998 --> 01:45:42,431
Who are you?

1728
01:45:42,633 --> 01:45:46,569
l heard your prayer.

1729
01:45:47,204 --> 01:45:48,671
l prayed for the lord's angel,

1730
01:45:48,906 --> 01:45:49,895
And the devil sent me you.

1731
01:45:50,141 --> 01:45:52,609
All l want is to comfort you.

1732
01:45:52,810 --> 01:45:54,277
Let me come near you.

1733
01:45:54,478 --> 01:45:56,878
You were near in the valley of Sorek,

1734
01:45:57,081 --> 01:45:59,481
Trading my love for philistine silver.

1735
01:45:59,683 --> 01:46:02,618
l'd give my life to undo what l've done.

1736
01:46:02,820 --> 01:46:06,415
l believed you once. You sold my sight.

1737
01:46:06,624 --> 01:46:09,092
l would endure your hatred, Samson,

1738
01:46:09,326 --> 01:46:12,090
lf it would bring back your sight.

1739
01:46:12,296 --> 01:46:14,196
Let me be your eyes.

1740
01:46:14,365 --> 01:46:17,857
Through my eyes, you will see again.

1741
01:46:18,102 --> 01:46:19,831
Through all the long darkness,

1742
01:46:20,037 --> 01:46:23,165
l prayed you'd be delivered
into my hands.

1743
01:46:23,374 --> 01:46:25,205
l'm here.

1744
01:46:25,376 --> 01:46:28,277
l will not cry out.

1745
01:46:28,479 --> 01:46:31,642
God has not forsaken me.

1746
01:46:31,849 --> 01:46:35,182
His will be done.

1747
01:46:35,386 --> 01:46:36,910
Samson! Samson!

1748
01:46:37,154 --> 01:46:38,587
Your chains...

1749
01:46:38,789 --> 01:46:42,725
They're broken.

1750
01:46:53,571 --> 01:46:56,540
Merciful god.

1751
01:46:57,007 --> 01:46:59,373
Your strength has come back.

1752
01:46:59,577 --> 01:47:02,569
Your god has answered you.

1753
01:47:02,813 --> 01:47:05,304
He's heard my voice in the darkness.

1754
01:47:05,549 --> 01:47:07,483
He's made you free.

1755
01:47:07,685 --> 01:47:10,347
No chains can bind you again.

1756
01:47:10,554 --> 01:47:13,785
Hisham will find the swiftest
camels in Gaza.

1757
01:47:13,991 --> 01:47:16,892
My silver will open the gates
that bar your way.

1758
01:47:17,094 --> 01:47:19,426
Tonight we'll be in the land
of the pharaohs.

1759
01:47:19,630 --> 01:47:22,292
The almighty didn't return my strength

1760
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,058
To run from my enemies.

1761
01:47:24,301 --> 01:47:27,134
You cannot fight what you cannot see.

1762
01:47:27,338 --> 01:47:29,704
l'll go out against them as l did
before.

1763
01:47:29,907 --> 01:47:31,670
A hundred spears will cut you down

1764
01:47:31,876 --> 01:47:37,815
Before you reach the gate.

1765
01:47:42,319 --> 01:47:44,412
l would hunt down their king

1766
01:47:44,622 --> 01:47:46,715
When l cannot even find the door.

1767
01:47:46,924 --> 01:47:50,758
Let me be the lamp that guides
you in the night.

1768
01:47:50,961 --> 01:47:53,020
O lord, my god,

1769
01:47:53,230 --> 01:47:55,596
Show me the way wherein to walk.

1770
01:47:55,799 --> 01:47:57,426
Show me the thing l must do.

1771
01:47:57,635 --> 01:48:01,230
ln the valley of the Nile,
we'll be safe.

1772
01:48:01,438 --> 01:48:03,065
We'll be together.

1773
01:48:03,274 --> 01:48:05,265
O judge of the earth,

1774
01:48:05,476 --> 01:48:07,467
Do not let me forgive her.

1775
01:48:07,711 --> 01:48:09,804
My arms will hold you again.

1776
01:48:10,014 --> 01:48:13,609
And put the food in my mouth?

1777
01:48:13,817 --> 01:48:14,146
When your heart is light,

1778
01:48:14,351 --> 01:48:16,376
l'll share your laughter.

1779
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:20,021
When you despair, my eyes will
shed your tears.

1780
01:48:20,224 --> 01:48:22,419
When l curse you for my darkness?

1781
01:48:22,626 --> 01:48:26,027
l will kneel and ask your forgiveness.

1782
01:48:26,230 --> 01:48:28,164
Vengeance is yours, o lord.

1783
01:48:28,365 --> 01:48:29,798
Strike her.

1784
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,264
Destroy her...

1785
01:48:32,469 --> 01:48:34,027
For l cannot.

1786
01:48:34,271 --> 01:48:36,762
My love, my love.

1787
01:48:37,007 --> 01:48:39,567
Delilah.

1788
01:48:39,777 --> 01:48:41,836
Delilah.

1789
01:48:42,046 --> 01:48:44,640
When my eyes could see, l was blind.

1790
01:48:44,848 --> 01:48:47,817
Oh, Samson.

1791
01:48:49,053 --> 01:48:50,452
We must hurry.

1792
01:48:50,654 --> 01:48:53,122
They're coming to take you to the
temple.

1793
01:48:53,324 --> 01:48:54,814
The temple? ls it today?

1794
01:48:55,059 --> 01:48:57,892
Yes. ln a few hours,
they'll come for you.

1795
01:48:58,095 --> 01:48:59,460
All Gaza will be there.

1796
01:48:59,663 --> 01:49:01,130
Thousands of people.

1797
01:49:01,365 --> 01:49:02,889
Mind the steps.

1798
01:49:03,133 --> 01:49:06,296
The great idol Dagon will be
a fiery furnace.

1799
01:49:06,503 --> 01:49:08,368
They'll humble you before him.

1800
01:49:08,539 --> 01:49:10,939
They'll bind you between the
two sacred columns

1801
01:49:11,141 --> 01:49:13,006
And scourge you.

1802
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:16,179
Two columns?

1803
01:49:16,647 --> 01:49:19,309
Does the house of the temple
stand on two columns?

1804
01:49:19,516 --> 01:49:20,710
Oh, hurry, Samson.

1805
01:49:20,918 --> 01:49:23,751
Egypt has a thousand temples,
each more beautiful...

1806
01:49:23,954 --> 01:49:26,548
Two columns so close

1807
01:49:26,757 --> 01:49:28,190
l may be bound between them?

1808
01:49:28,392 --> 01:49:30,223
Yes, and scourged.

1809
01:49:30,427 --> 01:49:32,861
By midday,, we'll be at the
spring of Yumis

1810
01:49:33,063 --> 01:49:35,463
With Egypt almost in sight.

1811
01:49:35,666 --> 01:49:40,365
l will stay here, Delilah.

1812
01:49:40,571 --> 01:49:41,503
They'll drag you down,

1813
01:49:41,705 --> 01:49:44,003
Make you kneel before their idol.

1814
01:49:44,208 --> 01:49:48,144
Oh, Samson, why?

1815
01:49:49,847 --> 01:49:52,543
The power of the lord is in my strength.

1816
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:58,689
Do not enter their temple today.

1817
01:51:23,107 --> 01:51:26,406
Miriam, look. lt's their god Dagon.

1818
01:51:26,610 --> 01:51:28,168
W shouldn't look at him.

1819
01:51:28,412 --> 01:51:34,351
We came to see their king,
not their idol.

1820
01:51:37,387 --> 01:51:38,615
Delilah! Delilah!

1821
01:51:38,822 --> 01:51:40,312
Delilah! Delilah!

1822
01:51:40,557 --> 01:51:42,047
Delilah! Delilah!

1823
01:51:42,292 --> 01:51:44,055
Delilah! Delilah!

1824
01:51:44,261 --> 01:51:48,197
Delilah! Delilah!

1825
01:51:53,971 --> 01:51:55,529
With a queen like you in Akron,

1826
01:51:55,773 --> 01:51:57,001
l could master the earth.

1827
01:51:57,207 --> 01:51:58,765
lf you could master Delilah.

1828
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:00,671
Ha ha. Ha ha.

1829
01:52:00,878 --> 01:52:03,540
We have Dancers in Ashkelon.

1830
01:52:03,714 --> 01:52:04,806
l came to see Samson.

1831
01:52:05,015 --> 01:52:07,813
Let this Danite clown make sport for us.

1832
01:52:08,018 --> 01:52:11,454
What sport can you find in
a blind man's stumbling?

1833
01:52:11,688 --> 01:52:13,781
This is your day of triumph.

1834
01:52:13,991 --> 01:52:15,151
All Gaza has come

1835
01:52:15,359 --> 01:52:18,226
To see Samson humbled at your feet.

1836
01:52:18,428 --> 01:52:21,397
Bring him.

1837
01:52:36,413 --> 01:52:39,405
They look like Danites.

1838
01:52:39,650 --> 01:52:41,515
They are Danites.

1839
01:52:41,718 --> 01:52:44,084
Danites come to worship Dagon, eh?

1840
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:46,756
No. We've come to speak with your king.

1841
01:52:46,990 --> 01:52:50,926
Let go of us. Let go.

1842
01:52:55,966 --> 01:52:58,457
Dagon has delivered Samson our enemy

1843
01:52:58,702 --> 01:52:59,999
lnto our hands.

1844
01:53:00,204 --> 01:53:01,068
Call him forth

1845
01:53:01,271 --> 01:53:05,469
That he may feel the might of Dagon.

1846
01:53:05,676 --> 01:53:08,201
Let us at him. Where is he?

1847
01:53:08,445 --> 01:53:13,382
Where is he? There he is.

1848
01:53:19,957 --> 01:53:22,755
Where's your god now, Samson?

1849
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:26,259
He left his god for a peacock.

1850
01:53:26,463 --> 01:53:27,293
Humble him!

1851
01:53:27,497 --> 01:53:32,434
Make the blind ox Dance!

1852
01:53:36,006 --> 01:53:38,975
By the horns of Nannar,
he's a man of iron.

1853
01:53:39,209 --> 01:53:41,370
He still looks strong enough
to kill a lion.

1854
01:53:41,578 --> 01:53:46,515
l wish l'd captured him.

1855
01:53:47,651 --> 01:53:49,118
Samson.

1856
01:53:49,353 --> 01:53:52,322
Samson!

1857
01:53:52,522 --> 01:53:55,491
After him!

1858
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:11,166
Samson!

1859
01:54:11,375 --> 01:54:15,709
Let the hopping toad lead the
blind bear.

1860
01:54:15,913 --> 01:54:17,676
Little shepherd still following
his lost sheep.

1861
01:54:17,848 --> 01:54:19,145
Lead him, boy.

1862
01:54:19,349 --> 01:54:22,318
Yes. Let me feel the pillars

1863
01:54:22,552 --> 01:54:23,917
Upon which the temple stands.

1864
01:54:24,121 --> 01:54:27,056
No. Get out where they can see you.

1865
01:54:27,257 --> 01:54:28,986
We've come to take you home.

1866
01:54:29,192 --> 01:54:29,624
Miriam is...

1867
01:54:29,826 --> 01:54:31,316
No, Saul.

1868
01:54:31,561 --> 01:54:33,256
There's no home for a leader

1869
01:54:33,463 --> 01:54:34,725
Who fails his people.

1870
01:54:34,932 --> 01:54:37,059
They'll always follow you, Samson.

1871
01:54:37,267 --> 01:54:39,235
l've led them a crooked path.

1872
01:54:39,469 --> 01:54:44,668
A blind man cannot travel by the stars.

1873
01:54:44,875 --> 01:54:48,276
Perhaps someday you will
guide them, Saul.

1874
01:54:48,478 --> 01:54:51,845
Join them together and be their
first king.

1875
01:54:52,049 --> 01:54:53,778
Me?

1876
01:54:53,984 --> 01:54:55,679
A king?

1877
01:54:55,886 --> 01:54:57,444
Get on with the sport!

1878
01:54:57,688 --> 01:55:00,156
l hear many voices.

1879
01:55:00,290 --> 01:55:02,019
ls the temple filled?

1880
01:55:02,225 --> 01:55:04,887
Packed like wheat in a shock.

1881
01:55:05,128 --> 01:55:06,595
Then go.

1882
01:55:06,797 --> 01:55:08,424
l've got my sling on my head.

1883
01:55:08,632 --> 01:55:10,998
We could fight our way out.

1884
01:55:11,201 --> 01:55:12,532
No, Saul.

1885
01:55:12,736 --> 01:55:14,135
Take Miriam and leave the temple.

1886
01:55:14,338 --> 01:55:16,306
But, Samson...

1887
01:55:16,506 --> 01:55:18,974
Let the sport begin.

1888
01:55:19,543 --> 01:55:21,067
Majesty, hear me!

1889
01:55:21,311 --> 01:55:24,075
Free the girl. Let her come.

1890
01:55:24,281 --> 01:55:26,749
Majesty...

1891
01:55:26,984 --> 01:55:28,918
You are a king a conqueror.

1892
01:55:29,119 --> 01:55:30,347
l ask mercy.

1893
01:55:30,554 --> 01:55:32,419
Mercy? What have you done?

1894
01:55:32,622 --> 01:55:36,456
l as mercy for a blind and helpless man.

1895
01:55:36,660 --> 01:55:38,457
Look at him.

1896
01:55:38,662 --> 01:55:40,527
He cannot harm you now.

1897
01:55:40,731 --> 01:55:41,561
He has lost everything

1898
01:55:41,765 --> 01:55:44,256
But the love of his people.

1899
01:55:44,501 --> 01:55:47,436
Let me take him back to them.

1900
01:55:47,637 --> 01:55:51,437
Have mercy, great king.

1901
01:55:51,641 --> 01:55:54,610
For this strength, l admire Samson.

1902
01:55:54,845 --> 01:55:57,939
For his revolt, l punish him.

1903
01:55:58,181 --> 01:56:02,117
For the love of his people, l envy him.

1904
01:56:02,352 --> 01:56:05,583
But, unfortunately,
he's not my prisoner.

1905
01:56:05,789 --> 01:56:07,620
He was not captured by force of arms,

1906
01:56:07,824 --> 01:56:10,156
But by their softness.

1907
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:12,453
His conqueror is here.

1908
01:56:12,662 --> 01:56:14,892
lf she wishes to give him to you,

1909
01:56:15,098 --> 01:56:19,034
She has my permission.

1910
01:56:19,970 --> 01:56:21,460
ln the valley of Sorek,

1911
01:56:21,705 --> 01:56:23,673
You said you loved him.

1912
01:56:23,874 --> 01:56:26,741
Then set him free.

1913
01:56:26,943 --> 01:56:29,309
lf there's love in you.

1914
01:56:29,513 --> 01:56:33,415
Let me take him back to his people.

1915
01:56:33,617 --> 01:56:37,417
What whimpering lies do you
tell our king?

1916
01:56:37,621 --> 01:56:39,646
You want him for yourself.

1917
01:56:39,890 --> 01:56:42,859
You want to feel his arms about you,

1918
01:56:43,060 --> 01:56:45,927
To hold him close and comfort him.

1919
01:56:46,129 --> 01:56:48,563
You want to bear him children.

1920
01:56:48,765 --> 01:56:52,963
l'd rather see him dead than in
your arms.

1921
01:56:53,170 --> 01:56:54,637
Take her away.

1922
01:56:54,871 --> 01:56:56,338
Guard.

1923
01:56:56,573 --> 01:56:58,564
Have mercy, great king.

1924
01:56:58,809 --> 01:57:02,711
Mercy for Samson!

1925
01:57:03,013 --> 01:57:05,675
Your mercy is like your love, Delilah.

1926
01:57:05,882 --> 01:57:08,851
Ruthless.

1927
01:57:35,412 --> 01:57:41,351
Where's your jawbone, Samson?

1928
01:57:45,222 --> 01:57:47,520
He'll get no honey from those bees.

1929
01:57:47,724 --> 01:57:49,624
The monkey men will cut him down.

1930
01:57:49,826 --> 01:57:51,293
They are devils.

1931
01:57:51,528 --> 01:57:53,223
No, they're very human.

1932
01:57:53,430 --> 01:57:55,057
The weak always band together

1933
01:57:55,298 --> 01:57:56,925
To pull down the strong.

1934
01:57:57,134 --> 01:57:59,125
Your lion has become a mouse.

1935
01:57:59,369 --> 01:58:05,274
Changed by the magic of love.

1936
01:58:18,788 --> 01:58:21,757
Garmiskar!

1937
01:58:24,161 --> 01:58:25,685
Garmiskar!

1938
01:58:25,929 --> 01:58:27,624
Garmiskar! Garmiskar!

1939
01:58:27,831 --> 01:58:28,354
Garmiskar! Garmiskar!

1940
01:58:28,598 --> 01:58:30,463
Make him beg for mercy!

1941
01:58:30,667 --> 01:58:32,862
Whip him to the god's feet.

1942
01:58:33,069 --> 01:58:35,936
He will never kneel to Dagon.

1943
01:58:36,106 --> 01:58:39,007
There's great persuasion at
the end of a whip.

1944
01:58:39,209 --> 01:58:41,404
No whip will break his spirit.

1945
01:58:41,611 --> 01:58:44,444
Either he kneel to Dagon or
he dies before him.

1946
01:58:44,648 --> 01:58:47,344
ls this religious zeal, Ahtur?

1947
01:58:47,551 --> 01:58:49,542
No high majesty.

1948
01:58:49,786 --> 01:58:52,755
Satisfaction.

1949
01:58:55,992 --> 01:58:57,118
What are they doing?

1950
01:58:57,360 --> 01:59:03,265
Little spiders weave their web.

1951
01:59:29,392 --> 01:59:35,331
The little fish have caught a whale.

1952
01:59:40,070 --> 01:59:40,729
Look. Look at Delilah.

1953
01:59:40,937 --> 01:59:44,304
l will go to him.

1954
01:59:44,507 --> 01:59:46,737
lf you go to him,

1955
01:59:46,943 --> 01:59:52,882
You cannot come back to me.

1956
01:59:59,756 --> 02:00:01,553
Delilah! Delilah!

1957
02:00:01,758 --> 02:00:03,089
Delilah! Delilah!

1958
02:00:03,293 --> 02:00:04,817
Delilah! Delilah!

1959
02:00:05,061 --> 02:00:08,997
Delilah! Delilah!

1960
02:00:12,936 --> 02:00:16,372
He is mine to punish. Go.

1961
02:00:16,606 --> 02:00:18,267
Delilah.

1962
02:00:18,475 --> 02:00:19,669
l must hurt you, my love,

1963
02:00:19,876 --> 02:00:21,366
That all may see. Forgive me.

1964
02:00:21,611 --> 02:00:24,079
l warned you to stay away.

1965
02:00:24,281 --> 02:00:26,715
When l strike, catch hold of the lash.

1966
02:00:26,916 --> 02:00:28,474
Lead me to the house of the temple.

1967
02:00:28,718 --> 02:00:31,687
l will.

1968
02:00:32,322 --> 02:00:33,789
Delilah! Delilah!

1969
02:00:33,990 --> 02:00:34,979
Delilah! Delilah!

1970
02:00:35,225 --> 02:00:36,749
He stole my cloak, Delilah.

1971
02:00:36,993 --> 02:00:42,932
Let him wear the mark of your whip.

1972
02:00:51,941 --> 02:00:53,772
He leads like a goat,

1973
02:00:53,977 --> 02:00:55,945
Why can't l lead you like that?

1974
02:00:56,146 --> 02:01:00,082
You're not Delilah.

1975
02:01:02,485 --> 02:01:04,248
Make him crawl, Delilah.

1976
02:01:04,454 --> 02:01:07,014
Put a ring through his nose!

1977
02:01:07,257 --> 02:01:10,385
Your peacock makes sport with an ox.

1978
02:01:10,593 --> 02:01:14,256
She is mocking us, not Samson.

1979
02:01:14,497 --> 02:01:17,625
Lord of the harvest, conqueror of death,

1980
02:01:17,834 --> 02:01:21,167
Now shall Samson be humble at your feet.

1981
02:01:21,371 --> 02:01:22,838
Make him bow!

1982
02:01:23,039 --> 02:01:24,529
Bend his neck before Dagon!

1983
02:01:24,774 --> 02:01:30,713
Look, Delilah made him bow!

1984
02:01:32,849 --> 02:01:34,714
l'm weary, Delilah.

1985
02:01:34,918 --> 02:01:35,907
Let me feel the pillars

1986
02:01:36,152 --> 02:01:37,050
That l may lean upon them.

1987
02:01:37,253 --> 02:01:41,189
Only a little further.

1988
02:01:47,630 --> 02:01:50,121
Humble yourself before their god,
Samson.

1989
02:01:50,367 --> 02:01:52,494
Kneel.

1990
02:01:52,702 --> 02:01:54,966
The house of this temple stands
on these columns?

1991
02:01:55,171 --> 02:01:58,140
Yes, Kneel.

1992
02:02:00,110 --> 02:02:01,600
The stone is cool

1993
02:02:01,845 --> 02:02:03,176
l will rest here.

1994
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:05,712
Let him be scourged

1995
02:02:05,915 --> 02:02:11,080
Until he turns from his god.

1996
02:02:11,287 --> 02:02:12,549
Go, Delilah.

1997
02:02:12,756 --> 02:02:14,849
Run. lnto the courtyard.

1998
02:02:15,058 --> 02:02:16,889
No.

1999
02:02:17,093 --> 02:02:20,028
Death will come into this temple.

2000
02:02:20,230 --> 02:02:22,960
The hand of the lord will strike.

2001
02:02:23,166 --> 02:02:25,634
l will not be afraid.

2002
02:02:25,835 --> 02:02:29,771
You must leave now.

2003
02:02:30,106 --> 02:02:34,304
Wherever you are, my love is with you.

2004
02:02:34,511 --> 02:02:37,002
Go.

2005
02:02:37,247 --> 02:02:39,112
Make him kneel to Dagon!

2006
02:02:39,315 --> 02:02:41,875
Yes! Make him kneel!

2007
02:02:42,085 --> 02:02:46,681
He'll not kneel to any god but his own.

2008
02:02:46,890 --> 02:02:52,829
The edge of a sword will bend his knees.

2009
02:02:53,863 --> 02:02:56,832
Delilah.

2010
02:02:57,801 --> 02:03:00,702
Have you gone?

2011
02:03:01,604 --> 02:03:04,573
Delilah!

2012
02:03:08,378 --> 02:03:09,845
l pray thee,

2013
02:03:10,046 --> 02:03:12,480
Strengthen me, o god.

2014
02:03:12,682 --> 02:03:18,621
Strengthen me only this once.

2015
02:03:23,059 --> 02:03:26,460
He thinks they're too close together!

2016
02:03:26,663 --> 02:03:27,630
What's he doing?

2017
02:03:27,864 --> 02:03:33,803
He's holding up the temple.

2018
02:03:38,408 --> 02:03:39,898
Scourge Samson to his knees

2019
02:03:40,143 --> 02:03:46,082
Beneath the feet of Dagon.

2020
02:03:51,221 --> 02:03:53,018
This is better than l'd bargained for.

2021
02:03:53,223 --> 02:03:55,123
Why, the man's crazed.

2022
02:03:55,325 --> 02:04:01,230
He's the funniest clown l've ever seen.

2023
02:04:20,583 --> 02:04:22,073
Look!

2024
02:04:22,318 --> 02:04:25,287
lt moved.

2025
02:04:29,659 --> 02:04:30,626
The column's moving.

2026
02:04:30,827 --> 02:04:32,192
He's split the stone.

2027
02:04:32,395 --> 02:04:35,330
The man has the strength of a devil.

2028
02:04:35,532 --> 02:04:40,469
No the strength of a god.

2029
02:04:43,940 --> 02:04:45,407
Dagon, be more powerful than Samson.

2030
02:04:45,642 --> 02:04:50,579
Forward! Run him through!

2031
02:05:02,292 --> 02:05:04,886
My eyes have seen thy glory, o god.

2032
02:05:05,094 --> 02:05:08,825
Now let me die with my enemies.

2033
02:05:09,032 --> 02:05:10,966
Kill him!

2034
02:05:11,167 --> 02:05:14,136
Cut him down!

2035
02:05:31,254 --> 02:05:32,949
Run, lord saran. Save yourself.

2036
02:05:33,156 --> 02:05:36,125
Save yourself.

2037
02:05:37,994 --> 02:05:40,963
No! Oh!

2038
02:05:50,239 --> 02:05:53,208
Delilah.

2039
02:06:22,138 --> 02:06:25,107
Mercy!

2040
02:06:31,781 --> 02:06:35,717
Lift it off! Help me!

2041
02:06:47,897 --> 02:06:50,422
He was so strong.

2042
02:06:50,667 --> 02:06:53,192
Why did he have to die?

2043
02:06:53,436 --> 02:06:59,375
His strength will never die, Saul.

2044
02:07:00,476 --> 02:07:07,905
Men will tell his story for a
thousand years.
