Hey, hey, Winnaker,
do you want me to get you a skirt?

I'll get you a skirt
if you keep playing like a girl.

It's tough, giving up a dream, starting over,

55
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:39,889
but I'm glad to hear you're interested
in a coaching position, Mr. Haskins.

56
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,393
McCarty here says you're a winner.

57
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:46,330
I sure appreciate that.
Now, my style of coaching is one that...

58
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:50,165
You played for Mr. Iba, so you know
how to reign in these unruly boys.

59
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:53,899
Sir, I do believe in discipline.
Now, my basketball philosophy is...

60
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:58,933
Mr. Haskins. You know, we're a small
school and we can't pay very much.

61
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,971
So we're gonna need you to live
in the men's dorm with your family

62
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,485
and keep those boys in line over there.

63
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,851
But your meals are free at the cafeteria.

64
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:15,157
And you got plenty of Texas sunshine.
So... how's it sound?

65
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:22,131
If that's what it takes
to coach Division I basketball, then...

66
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,500
ha-ha-ha, that's all right with me.

67
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,804
It's just a dusty old cow town.

68
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,503
Yeah, but if it's got a court with a roof
and uniforms that match,

69
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:35,070
then I wanna coach there.
I wanna play against the best.

70
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,844
I just wanted to thank you
for bringing me on.

This is my wife, Mary.

79

Hi, Mrs. Haskins. Come on in here.

80
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,503
- Hate to put you out.
- Oh, no.

81
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,773
You ain't putting me out.
Don't think about it.

82
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:11,112
I'm thinking about leaving
this prize gator here for you.

83
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,880
- Makes a fine ceiling ornament.
- Cool.

84
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,511
You hear that? I made up my mind.

85
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,716
That little boy love that gator.
I'm gonna leave him there.

86
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,090
I've been checking the cupboard.
It's a little bare.

87
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,528
We got Baudoin outta Albuquerque,
20 points a game last year.

88
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:30,729
Got us a Missouri boy. Fast and tough
on defense - a kid named Armstrong.

93
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,211
Taco night?

94
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:46,951
Taco night.

95
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,686
What's the budget for recruiting?

96
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,659
Ross says the budget's in the lights.

97
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,596
How can I have a winning team
with no budget for recruiting?

98
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,574
Now, listen, Coach. Football is king here.

99
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,167
And basketball sucks hind tit.

100
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:16,477
I'll shake down the boosters for a few more
bucks, get a couple more scholarships.

101
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:17,982
A few more bucks?

102
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,714
I gotta go find players. How can I recruit
with one or two scholarships?

103
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:26,122
Do you forget where you come from, Don?
Coaching high school girls.

104
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:30,094
Take a look around you.
This ain't Kansas, Duke, Kentucky.

105
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:34,361
We're a poor school that counts
every penny to pay for a river rat's dream

106
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,958
of a college education.

107
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,435
We're lucky to put a decent team
on the court.

108
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,029
Well, decent don't cut it with me.

109
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,801
Duke's where you wanna go.

110
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,676
Hey, how you doing?
Don Haskins, Texas Western.

111
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,648
How you doing? Don Haskins.

112
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,621
- See anyone you like?
- What about number three over there?

113
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:59,021
Jason Stevens out of Chicago.
18 points a game.

Jason!

116
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,797
Beating a dead horse there, Don.

117
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,198
- Jason, Don Haskins, Texas Western.
- Western Union?

118
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,463
Texas Western, down in El Paso.

119
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,904
After the game, I'd like to talk to you
about playing for me.

120
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:20,241
Play for you at Texas Western?
Thanks, Coach, but I'm partial to winning.

121
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:28,483
How about that big ol' tall boy?
Made All-Jayhawk Conference last year.

122
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,523
Gonna sign with Kansas.

123
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,692
(whistle blows)

124
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,730
(buzzer sounds)

125
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,517
You wanna talk to Bobby Joe Hill?

126
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,387
Son, you can't win playing nigger ball.

127
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,587
Sure, they can jump, but they can't lead.

128
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,426
Can't handle the pressure.
Don't have enough intelligence.

129
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,592
That boy in particular.
No-account smart-mouth.

130
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,260
Just tell me where I can find him.

131
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:24,536
Excuse me. I'm the basketball coach
down at Texas Western.

132
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,738
- I'd like to talk to you about playing there.
- No, thanks.

133
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:31,614
I'm done playing this game.
They hardly put me on the floor tonight.

134
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,879
- I'm offering a full scholarship.
- Uh-huh.

135
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,821
You sign me up like your token Negro,
bury me at the end of the bench.

136
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,620
I'd rather hang it up. Do something else.

137
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:44,424
Be the next Smokey Robinson.
I might even run for president.

138
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,830
You got a real talent, son.
Why throw it away?

139
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:53,395
I'll tell you why. Ever since I was a kid, I
only loved one thing - that was playing ball.

140
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,931
Do you understand what that's like,
to have that ball in your hand?

141
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,477
It's like making sweet music
with your game.

142
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:03,174
Only thing is,
you don't wanna hear the song.

143
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,983
You talk a good game, Hill.

144
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,625
I didn't come here to find a player
I could sit on the bench.

145
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:17,527
I intend to start you -
start NCAA Division One ball.

146
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:22,034
What is it with you, mister?
I've accepted it. What are you smoking?

147
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,066
I ain't smoking nothing, son.

148
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:31,973
Now, you just told me about a big old
dream you have. I can let you play.

149
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:37,311
I can help you make your dream come true
faster than a twister'll take your socks off.

150
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,178
You talk funny.

151
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,487
So do you.

152
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,993
You gonna let a black player play
from the get-go?

153
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:53,327
I don't see color. I see quick,
I see skill, and that's what you have.

154
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,732
And that's what I'm putting on the court.

155
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:07,707
So, what is this team, anyway?

156
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,715
All right, that New York recruiter,
Hilton White.

157
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:14,014
He's got three boys up there now.
They're just playground kids.

158
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,384
He said they could play with anybody.

159
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:21,017
Every one of these players
you're looking at is colored, Don.

160
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,923
How many are you recruiting?

161
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:27,454
We need seven players on this team
who can put it in the hole and rebound.

162
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,899
Now, if they're colored, well, fine.

163
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,832
Well, then now, Coach,
let me try to paint you a little picture.

164
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,502
There are no coloreds playing
Division One basketball in the South.

165
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:43,413
Not in the SEC, not in the ACC
and not in the SWC.

166
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,950
But you go and put seven of 'em
on our team.

167
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:49,283
Am I losing my hearing?
Do I need a darn hearing aid?

168
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:52,256
No, Ross. I intend to win.

169
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,787
Shoot. You carrying on like Negroes
gonna be the future of basketball.

170
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:58,762
Could you imagine that?

171
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,897
There are rules. Unwritten rules.

172
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:06,428
You play one at home, two on the road
and three if you're losing.

173
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,941
Lord have mercy. Loadin' up
on Negroes, that just ain't done.

174
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:15,311
You gonna put your career at risk,
my career at risk and Moe's career at risk.

175
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:19,249
(Moe) If that wasn't bad enough, we ain't
even got enough gas money to get home.

176
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,809
Ain't it lucky you don't got
to worry about that?

177
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,947
'Cause you'll be out on the first bus
to New York tomorrow.

178
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:29,654
You're sending me there for schoolyard
players? You gotta be out of your mind.

179
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,527
And who's paying for all this,
if you don't mind me asking?

180
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:36,762
(Haskin) You wanna win. You gotta
recruit. That's how the big boys do it.

181
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,111
It was a good game, man.

182
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,204
Hey, kid, you got a minute?

183
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:52,250
Mama baked a pie. One piece left,
it's got my name all over it.

184
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,219
Hey, kid, you got a minute?

185
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,822
- You know that guy?
- What? No.

186
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,292
Kid, you got a minute?

187
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,420
Run. Run!

188
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,759
Hey, Charlie!

189
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,909
Hey, Mama. You're not gonna believe
what just happened to me and Alvin.

190
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:22,038
Almost got jumped
by a couple of crackers.

191
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,446
I'm just dying for a piece of that...

192
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,247
...pie.
- Ma'am, this pie is so good,

193
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,583
it makes me mad at my mama.

194
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:33,056
This is Mr. Haskins.
He come all the way from El Paso, Texas.

195
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,457
He want you to play basketball
on a scholarship.

196
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,520
Texas? To get lynched?

197
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:43,830
Now, El Paso's not like the rest of Texas.
It's, um... It's more cosmopolitan.

198
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,269
Pops already got me a good job
at the factory...

199
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,535
- I always wanted an education for Harry.
- They got schools here.

200
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:53,442
I don't feel comfortable
sending my boy that far away

201
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,980
and trusting him to a stranger.

202
00:11:56,048 --> 00:12:01,418
I know. I understand. I will look
after him like he's one of my own.

203
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:05,719
- You ate my pie.
- We're church people around here.

204
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,089
Are you?

205
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,628
I won't lie.
I hadn't been to church in so long,

206
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,192
I can't remember
which day of the week it falls on.

207
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,535
I'm ashamed to say I'm... I'm just a wretch.

208
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:24,765
Well...

209
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:29,110
We all fall short.
And we're saved by grace.

210
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,810
- Tell me more about El Paso.
- No, Mama. Mama, come on, now.

211
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:38,221
It's lovely, ma'am. It's right on the banks
of the Rio Grande. It's a little oasis.

212
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,819
Nah.

213
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,522
- I got plenty of offers.
- Yeah?

214
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,727
From who? Duke? Kansas?

215
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,928
- I'm playing for the Globetrotters.
- It's probably for the best.

216
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:58,807
You're better off with the Trotters
playing its team of patsies every night.

217
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:04,441
You can't get past an average defender in
our league with that fancy dribble of yours.

218
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,384
Man, no offense, but that's bull.

219
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,978
Hey, brother, no offense,
but without work,

220
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,922
I don't think you'd get past
a beat-up old-timer like me.

221
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,459
(laughter)

222
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,722
Get past you?

223
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:22,431
I would go past you, through you,
over you, under you, around you.

224
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,231
As a matter of fact,
I'll spin you like a top,

225
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,933
eat your lunch, steal your girl
and kick your dog at the same time.

226
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,066
(scoffs)

227
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,336
Get past you.

228
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,744
- Come on, Orsten!
- Hey, come on.

229
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,839
(girl) Do your thang.

230
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,816
- You fouling me.
- You call that a foul?

231
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:41,819
My three year old calls that a love tap.

232
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,887
(girl) Ooh! Come on, man.

233
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,654
Hey, hold it, hold it.

234
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:51,924
You expect me to react to all
that head-shake and body gyration?

235
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,488
It's activity without accomplishment.

236
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:58,230
You got the ball in front of you.
You ain't going anywhere without it.

237
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:02,070
Try this. It's called a rocker step.
You ready? Get in your stance.

238
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,268
OK?

239
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,141
The difference between me and you
is I got the ball protected.

240
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,512
It looks like I'm starting to dribble,
so you react, and when you do,

241
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,347
cross over, dribble right by you.

242
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:19,785
Try it. It's simple, but it'll make
that pretty little shot of yours work.

243
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,019
(cheering)

244
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,156
First time. There it is.

245
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,397
Excuse me!

246
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,563
I'm looking for three guys. Uh...

247
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,665
Names of Nevil Shed,

248
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:40,337
Willie Worsley and Willie Cager.

249
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,846
They're colored boys.
You know them?

250
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,383
- Did he say "colored"?
- He said what I think he did.

251
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,611
Yeah.

252
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:51,315
And I don't think he was talking
about no television set, neither.

253
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,085
He got a nice car.

254
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:56,525
These New York kids may be
from the street, but they sure can play.

255
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,358
Little guard plays like a giant.

256
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,126
Forward runs like an antelope.
Never seen anything like him.

257
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,964
- How long till you can have 'em out?
- A week maybe.

258
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,834
How's it with Lattin?
These boys play big, but they ain't big.

259
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,271
Hey!

260
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,934
You want me to fill this thing up?

261
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,171
I called his coach, but he run me off.

262
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,713
I still got one more roll of these dice,
though.

263
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,772
And one more little thing, Don.

264
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,943
I had a little misunderstanding here.

265
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,749
Do you think you could wire me
another hundred dollars?

266
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,164
Where on earth's this coach taking us?

267
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,902
I don't think we're even
on earth anymore, brah.

268
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,773
- Say, Willie.
- Yeah.

269
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,744
- You got a dime?
- For what?

270
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,416
I gotta call my mama.
Tell her I'm an astronaut.

271
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,884
Looks like we're the first black men
on the moon.

272
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,053
What's this dead stuff
on the side of the road?

273
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,218
Players from last year's team
trying to crawl back to New York.

274
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,455
We driving into hell, plain and simple.

275
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,966
El Paso, Texas! Ain't no place like it.

276
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,734
Big ol' west Texas sun shining down
about 330 days a year.

277
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,830
Yes, sir, you're in God's country now.

278
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:19,241
If this is God's country, obviously
the good Lord don't want no neighbors.

279
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,249
Say, man,
this place looks like Bonanza.

280
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,845
Hey, look, just smile at 'em
and say "howdy."

281
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,116
Howdy.

282
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,754
To him you gotta say "hole-ah."
Like this, see.

283
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,263
Hole-ah!

284
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,427
- Man, what this "hole-ah" mean?
- It means, "Hello, Puerto Ricans."

285
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,300
You've signed some black players, Don?

286
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,600
That's right.

287
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,107
Seven of them?

288
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,164
(chuckles)

289
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:55,839
I'm not sure that all the boosters
are gonna like it. All right?

290
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:59,179
It's a little different
than what they're used to.

291
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:02,084
You hired me to put a team together -
that's what I'm doing.

292
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,714
No, Don.

293
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,089
I hired you to ride herd
on the athletic dorm.

294
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,391
I've got a little more
than I bargained for.

295
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,230
Those our new teammates?

296
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,734
(man) Ross said things
were gonna be different.

297
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,795
Doesn't look like he was kidding.

298
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,400
- I ain't never seen one of them before.
- One what?

299
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,774
One of them - a colored.

300
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,745
You've gotta get off the farm more.

301
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:32,545
I'll have some of that and some of this
and some of that.

302
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,416
- Save a brother some scraps.

You big-toothed clown.

304

smaller grilles than those teeth of yours.

Messing around down here
like a bunch of kindergarten kids.

345

Now, you get this place cleaned up
and try to act like you got some sense.

- Mighty Miners?

369
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:59,841
You're at a hole-digging college.
A commuter school.

00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,614
That's funny.

372
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,428
What is he talking about,
girls' basketball coach?

373
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:16,593
You're here to learn fundamental,
disciplined defensive basketball.

374
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:20,900
Now, that means discipline
both on and off the court.

375
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,963
No girls.

376

No booze. No late nights.

377
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,943
Nothing besides fundamental basketball.

00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:33,681

379
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:37,518

or "Coach, I'm bleeding."

I don't wanna hear anything
except the basketball bounce.

381
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:48,059
You play basketball my way.
My way's hard.

382
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:51,432

Get your butt down!

387
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:07,410
Lower! Make it uncomfortable!
There you go.

388

What's the matter, son?
Your skirt bothering ya?

389
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:16,626

Lock him down.

You let him put his armpits in the rim.

in Mexico for you, boy.

456
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:21,494
(laughter)

457
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,370
(man) Doing OK, Tina?

458
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:28,037
Hey, listen.
I was just playing with you back there.

459
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:30,581
My name is Bobby Joe.

460
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,845
My friends call me Bobby Joe.

461
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:37,445
Tina.
And I go to the same school you do.

462
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:41,515
And I'm not about to fall
for that smooth-talking Negro routine.

463
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:44,960
- My mama warned me about you.
- Your mama don't even know me.

464
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:49,399
She said watch out for pretty boys
with big smiles, worn shoes,

465
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,560
and single dollars in their pockets.

466
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:56,164
Well, that's not me.
I'm telling you, you got me all wrong.

467

Cómo estás. Everybody?

00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,693
(belches)

474
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,698
What was that, son?
I didn't get that.

475
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:27,596
How is everybody today?
Feeling all right?

476
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,833
You OK, Bobby Joe?

477
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:36,609
Hey, I hear you speak Spanish, right?

478
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,673
- Sir?
- I'm just wondering.

479
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:45,348
You looking a little tired. All that fancy
footwork of yours tire you out yesterday?

480
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:47,914
Or was it something else?

481
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,227
Now, because some of you were bitten
by the evil worm last night,

482
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:55,357
this morning, all of you are gonna run.

483
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:59,096
- The evil worm never bit me!
- Hundred lines! Let's do it! Let's sprint!

484
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,900
Lattin, get to the baseline, son.

485
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,105
Y'all are gonna burn holes
in your shoes today!

486
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:12,946
You look like you're running in mud, son!
Are you kiddin' me? Are you kiddin' me?

487
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,747
Hill, get your butt down.

488
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:21,019
There's 31 days before the season starts,
and you're gonna run every one of 'em.

489
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,218
Oh, that was pretty.
Hey, that was real pretty.

490
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:28,254
Everybody see that behind-the-back?
The circus has come to town.

491
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,733
- What are you doing?
- I'm just playing my game.

492
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:34,704
We're playing my game here.
All that other stuff's just insecurity.

493
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:42,475
Great players make simple, basic,
easy plays. Showboating's just insecurity.

494
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,306
He didn't want us playing our game?
Why'd he bring us here?

495
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:50,047
- Man, I'm sick of him riding my butt.
- I don't need this, man!

496
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,249
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- Yes, you do.

497
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:03,223
This ain't basketball. You killing us!

498
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:07,635
Well, from where I'm standing,
you don't got much to bargain with.

499
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,605
What?

500
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,667
You wanna quit?

501
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,243
You wanna quit?

502
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:20,944
You quit right now,
you'll quit every day the rest of your life.

503
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,185
Watch.

504
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,150
Don't worry.
Gunsmoke wasn't that good tonight.

505
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,284
How was the practice?

506
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:07,227
That good, huh?

507
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:11,825
Come on! Move those feet!
Move the ball, faster! Faster!

508
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,332
Get off me, farm boy.

509
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:19,376
- Quit your crying, Harlem.
- I told you I wasn't from Harlem!

Knock it off! Knock it...

511

Knock it off! Knock it off!
Knock it off! Knock it off!

512
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,342
You'd done that in a game,
it'd be a technical foul for fighting.

513
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,514
Both of you'd be ejected.
Probably cost us the game, son.

514
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,287
Baseline, everybody. Y'all gonna run
'cause of their selfishness.

515
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,886
Two weeks before the game,
and you still don't listen.

516
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:43,229
Class, make sure can you identify
all the minerals in your boxes.

517
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:48,705
I'll be passing around to your stations,
so if you have any problems, let me know.

518
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,646
This team does not play playground ball.

519
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:04,916
We play fundamental, disciplined
defensive basketball.

520
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,924
Togo? Hey, show Mr. Cager
how to make a shot.

521
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,629
There you go.

522
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,194
- You want me to do that?
- Mm-hm.

523
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,036
Come on, Coach. What about my stylin'?
I got way too much style to do that.

524
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:28,477
You leave the styling for the barber shop.
Just show me you belong in the NCAA.

525
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,419
OK, guys.

526
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,652

527
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,098
You're a smart kid, Harry.

528
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,828
But these grades ain't pulling the truck
up the hill.

529
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:54,929
It's just that every class is about rocks,
and I'm a black man. I don't do rocks.

530
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,337
Mm-hm.

531
00:32:56,407 --> 00:33:00,571
You got two weeks to get your grades up.
Or else.

532

- Yes, sir.

- No.

- Yeah.
- She's a cutie pie, but she's not cute.

540
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:39,078
Who can tell me the field classification
of phaneritic rocks?

541
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,277
My son Harry can.

542
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:42,908
Yes, ma'am.

543
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:46,923
- Granite, syenite and gabbro.

Can anybody tell me
how they are formed?

545
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,329
Yes, ma'am. Harry can.

546
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:57,532
- By slow cooling plutons?
- And what is a pluton?

547
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,297
Harry.

548
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:04,868
It is a deep-seated igneous intrusion
with no visible floor.

00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,878
playing with players
none of the big schools wanted.

608
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,611
But those people don't know you. I do.

609
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:10,711
You're talented. You're disciplined.

610
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,382
And you care about the guy
standing next to you.

611
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,187
That's how we're gonna win,
starting tomorrow night.

612
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,424
So let's go out there
and let's play Texas Western basketball.

613
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,760
Let's make that mean something.

614
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:27,994
On three.

615
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,475
One, two, three.

616
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,305
(all) Miners!

617
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:35,072
All right, all right.

618
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,445
- Let's go, quick. Come on.
- Here we go.

619
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:42,475
- What are you still doing here, Shed?
- I'm... I'm ready to play.

620
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:46,683
Well, you had your chance to be a man.
Now, go on. Take your ticket and go home.

621
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:50,420
- Come on, man, let me play.
- I can't. You might get hurt.

622
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,258
Let me play!

623
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:57,028
Come on, come on, come on!
I don't care how tired you are.

624
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,630
That's the way to play.

625
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,501
Let me look at that. Come here
and let me look at that! Hold on.

626
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,604
- I'm all right.
- I know you're OK.

627
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:14,947
You're walking, but your nose ain't in
good shape. You're getting blood all over.

628
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,978
- I'm all right.
- Hold your head back. You're bleeding.

629
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,490
All right, let's play. Come on.

630
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:29,356
Quit hopping around like a jack rabbit.
I said rotate in.

631
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,965
(Bobby Joe) You a catcher now?

632
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:42,677
- Ain't nothing gonna stop me from playing.
- He won't go to the doctor, Coach.

633
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:46,615
That's right. I'm not going anywhere.
I'm here to stay.

634
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:53,023
Just go get your nose taken care of.
We're gonna need ya this season, all right?

635
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,217
(Meyer) There you go, Nevil.

636
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:01,355
(# marching band)

637
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:09,898
Hi again. Everybody. This is Judd Milton.
The voice of the Miners on KTSM 1380.

638
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,771
Welcome. It's our home opener.

639
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:16,404
And we're hosting the Greyhounds
of Eastern New Mexico State College.

640
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,471
This is a night of questions.

641
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:23,452
Will Don Haskins, the little-known coach
of the Benjamin High School girls' team,

642
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,785
be able to lift the Miners
to respectability?

643
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,016
- Let me see.
- Let go!

644
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,854
- What?
- Don't touch it, man.

645
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,553
Hey, man. Where were you?

646
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:34,621
It was a late night,
if y'all know what I mean.

647
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,098
Are you ever gonna straighten up, man?

648
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,466
Somebody say something?

649
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:43,064
And now your Texas Western Miners!

650
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,199
(# fanfare)

651
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:54,882
(announcer on PA) At guard.
El Paso's own David Palacio!

652
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:59,616
At forward, from Eagleville, Missouri,
Jerry Armstrong!

653
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:05,555
At guard. From Detroit. Michigan.
Bobby Joe Hill!

654
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,063
(scant clapping)

655
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:13,726
At forward. From Gary. Indiana.
Harry Flournoy!

656
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,465
(scant clapping)

657
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:22,907
And in center. From Houston. Texas.
David "Big Daddy D" Lattin!

658
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,914
(scant clapping)

659
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:29,643
Three of 'em, Wallace. They look like
the damn Tuskegee Institute out there.

660
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,655
Just when did we become
a colored school?

661
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,987
... your 1965 Texas Western Miners!

662
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:38,460
(sparse applause/whistle blows)

663
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,690
The Miners win the tip-off
to start the season.

664
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:43,699
- Go, Hill. Set it up. Take your time.
- Set it up!

665
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:50,363
Hey, protect the ball.

666
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,100
(Milton) Not a good start for the Miners.

667
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,772
Hey, Hill, you notice your man
just scored on you?

668
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,610
Mitch, over here, over here!

669
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,879
- Hill spins to the basket. Puts it up for two!
- Stop showboating!

670
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:05,786
Fundamental basketball, Hill.
Watch your base.

671
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,689
You didn't have a base -
that's how he went around you.

672
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:14,220
Coach Haskins trying to mold these guys
into team players... Cager for two.

673
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,960
Cager, just lay the ball off the board.

674
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:23,495
Get your hand in his face, son!
You gotta challenge that shot.

675
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:26,042
Right here, over here. Shoot it.

676
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,704
Where's the D? There ain't no D.

677
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:32,144
Hill wheelin' and dealin'.
The ball's loose!

678
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,014
- That's why I don't want you showboating.
- Let's go!

679
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:38,020
Hey, Armstrong. Hey, Flournoy.
Are you kiddin' me?

680
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:41,319
Lattin, you're ankle-deep in the floor, son.

681
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,860
Drive that ball! There it is!

682
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,092
Hey, I saw it, son.

683
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,396
And the Miners lead by four.

684
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:53,727
They need one stop now.

685
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:56,671
Good defense, Armstrong!
Good defense!

686
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:01,074
So the Don Haskins era begins
in victory. A four-point win

687
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:04,205
over a less-than-impressive squad
from Eastern New Mexico.

688
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:06,010
But the real story tonight -

689
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:10,042
Coach Haskins putting three Negro
players into the starting lineup -

690
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,420
a move that's sure to stir things up
both on and off the court this season.

691
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:23,961
(# "I've Been Loving You Too Long (To
Stop Now)" by Otis Redding over radio)

692
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:42,280
- You've got all the moves, don't you?
- Oh, yeah.

693
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,583
Tried it on a hundred girls?

694
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:45,952
Ah...

695
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:48,491
Maybe 50 or 60.

696
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:56,556
(Tina) I'm tired of moving around.
I just wanna stay in one place for a while.

697
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:01,594
Put down some roots for once.
You got what it takes, Bobby Joe?

698
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,417
(panting)

699
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:22,614
(coughs)

700
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:27,025
- Hey, Coach, I can't go no more!
- I think you can go some more.

701
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:30,794
You got energy for all kind of nonsense
instead of putting it in your team!

702
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:33,996
Instead of demonstrating some respect
and being a leader!

703
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:36,062
I ain't got no team!

704
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,439
We ain't going nowhere! You telling us
all the time how bad we are!

705
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,606
We know we ain't gonna win!
What do I got to respect?

706
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:55,455
My old man drove a truck
for the better half of his life.

707
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:59,860
Now, there ain't nothing wrong with that...
other than the fact he hated it.

708
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,524
That's the only way he knew
how to put food on the table

709
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:06,933
and give his kids a chance
to do something they loved.

710
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:10,701
I love this game. I love this game.

711
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:13,870
I never was the greatest player.

712
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:18,347
But I busted my butt,
and I outworked better players.

713
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:22,909
I ain't the smartest coach, but I bust
my butt and I outwork smarter coaches.

714
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:28,947
And when I see the talent you got
and I see you wasting it, ticks me off.

715
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:34,328
Now, if you couldn't get in the gym,
if you didn't have the opportunity,

716
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,662
there'd be nothing for us to talk about,

717
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:40,830
but, son, I've been there.
Times are different. You're in the gym.

718
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:45,341
And if you're in the gym, you step out on
that floor, you better respect my father, me,

719
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:49,812
and you better respect yourself
and play some basketball.

720
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:55,009
Midway through the first half.
Iowa playing well.

721
00:45:55,085 --> 00:46:00,387
Of course. That's to be expected. They're
undefeated. Number four in the country.

722
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:07,353
Iowa. Always a contender in the Big Ten.
And there's a bucket for the Hawkeyes.

723
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:11,629
Coach Haskins is not happy.
It's an eight-point game right now.

724
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,234
Hey! Tighten up out there!

725
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:19,404
(Lattin) Stay on him! Stay on him!

726
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:22,036
Shed, box out! Shed!

727
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:28,544
- (referee blows whistle) Count the bucket.
- Shed, would you box out?

728
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:32,446
That's it! We got 'em now.

729
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:36,619
Texas Western struggling to score
against this tough Hawkeyes' defense.

730
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:39,025
And there's a great block
just before the half.

731
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,154
(buzzer signals end of half)

732
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:44,894
I've seen a lot of rough halves in
basketball. But the Miners are struggling.

733
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:48,836
They'll go to the locker room
down by 16 points.

734
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:53,335
Say it, Hill.
Come on, Hill, say it.

735
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:58,109
We can't play like this!
They're better than us at your game.

736
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:00,650
You need to let us loose!

737
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:03,481
Just stick to the plan, Bobby Joe.

738
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:06,717
You want fundamental basketball, right?

739
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,124
(crowd jeering)

740
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:14,858
Iowa is just flat outplaying Texas
Western. It's been a difficult game so far.

741
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:17,696
Ain't our night, Coach.

742
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:20,566
Hey, Hill. Time-out.
Time, time, time!

743
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:22,537
Time-out, white.

744
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,506
Coach...

745
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,143
if you let us play our game.

746
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:40,887
All right, Hill, you play your game.
And you play my game.

747
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:45,489
- You ready to play?
- Yeah, let's do it.

748
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:57,463
And the Miners have a couple of baskets
back to back.

749
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,532
Still. Though. A huge deficit.

750
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:08,145
Orsten Artis with a steal. Bounce pass to
Bobby Joe Hill. He drives it in for two!

751
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:12,587
Well. The Miners have really turned it up
a notch defensively.

752
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:18,757
Now it looks like Iowa is the team
that's struggling.

753
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:22,196
This full-court pressure by the Miners
has the Hawkeyes rattled.

754
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:24,530

00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:20,120
Mary?

907
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:25,190
You're really late, Don.
Don't come home late without calling.

908
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:27,862
You know, things happen to people...

909
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:31,168
- Lemme get your plate and I'll heat it up.
- Honey, what is it?

910
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:35,200
- Lemme get it. It'll only take a minute.
- Mary, just talk to me. What is it?

911
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:37,769
Hey, what is this?

912
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,042
Honey, what is this?

913
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,288
- This the first?
- No, I...

914
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,958
I throw them away
as soon as I get them.

915
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:01,493
- Why didn't you say something to me?
- I don't know. I just...

916
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:11,072
My family's most important. How can I
protect you if I don't know what's going on?

917
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:13,505
Don.

918
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:17,713
Basketball's been our whole life.
But it's just a game.

919
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:22,082
I don't know if it's worth this.

920
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:29,995
No, neither do I.

921
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:37,566
This is more than just a game now.
And I sure as hell can't quit on it.

922
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:13,000
(Bobby Joe) Nothing ever
bothered me before.

923
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:16,807
It's like things,
they rolled right off my back.

924
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:19,245
I just didn't care.

925
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:24,820
Now I care.
That scares the heck outta me.

926
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:28,015
I don't wanna want something
I can lose.

927
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,793
Baby.

928
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:34,887
There's nothing you can't lose.

929
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:40,425
But no one can ever take your desire
away from you. No one.

930
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:42,095
Ever.

931
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:48,706
You know, Scoops, man, sometimes I don't
even feel like going back out there again.

932
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:52,578
Look. You can't let them take basketball
away from you, man.

933
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,776
You can't let them win.

934
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:59,584
I just don't know how much more of this
I can handle, man. I ain't like you, all brave.

935
01:00:59,613 --> 01:01:03,947
Sweet Pea, as long as I known you,
you been stronger than you think.

936
01:01:09,556 --> 01:01:11,820
Hey, you OK, Scoops?

937
01:01:11,891 --> 01:01:13,688
Yeah, I'm fine, man.

938
01:01:15,762 --> 01:01:19,163
Hey, man. Hey, tell me
what's goin' on, man. You OK?

939
01:01:19,232 --> 01:01:22,429
- (teacher) Be ready, please. Thank you.
- (bell rings)

940
01:01:34,781 --> 01:01:36,772
Scoops, you got a minute?

941
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:41,753
Says you got something called
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

942
01:01:41,821 --> 01:01:44,221
My heart's too big.

943
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:46,417
Ain't that something?

944
01:01:47,761 --> 01:01:50,628
How long you known, Scoops?

945
01:01:50,697 --> 01:01:53,564
Well, I...

946
01:01:53,633 --> 01:01:57,626
I started fainting
when I was in high school, Coach.

947
01:01:57,704 --> 01:02:00,195
So my mom being who she is,
she took me to the doctor.

948
01:02:00,273 --> 01:02:03,208
They ran a few tests. That's how
I found out. But it doesn't matter.

949
01:02:03,276 --> 01:02:06,643
You're a fool. You're a dang fool.
You could have died out there.

950
01:02:06,713 --> 01:02:09,113
Coach, I'll die if I don't play.

951
01:02:10,316 --> 01:02:14,685
Look, Coach. My whole life
I only loved playing basketball.

952
01:02:14,754 --> 01:02:18,087
That's it. But you see,
I could never play in high school,

953
01:02:18,158 --> 01:02:22,185
because I had to work
to support my mom and my sisters.

954
01:02:24,364 --> 01:02:30,166
But I never stopped playing in the street.
Never. 'Cause to not play, Coach, man...

955
01:02:30,236 --> 01:02:34,730
Man. That was like letting something
just crawl up and die in me.

956
01:02:34,808 --> 01:02:37,368
Far as this heart thing goes,
I can still play.

957
01:02:37,444 --> 01:02:41,676
My heart's good. This heart thing
ain't nothing. I lived with it this long.

958
01:02:41,748 --> 01:02:44,080
- That's why you gotta play me.
- I can't do it.

959
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:45,879
- The doctor said I could.
- I can't.

960
01:02:45,952 --> 01:02:49,353
He said I could play a few minutes here
and there. Why you won't let me?

961
01:02:49,422 --> 01:02:52,016
I know what the doctor said, Willie.

962
01:02:52,092 --> 01:02:56,893
But I can't take a chance with your life.
I can't do that.

963
01:02:56,963 --> 01:02:59,523
Now, you're still on the team.

964
01:03:00,133 --> 01:03:02,328
We're gonna need you, Cager.

965
01:03:02,402 --> 01:03:04,836
We're gonna need your courage.

966
01:03:05,672 --> 01:03:07,537
(Don chuckles)

967
01:03:08,475 --> 01:03:11,603
We're gonna need that big heart of yours,
all right?

968
01:03:11,678 --> 01:03:14,442
(# "People Get Ready"
by The Impressions)

969
01:03:14,514 --> 01:03:19,747
- # People. Get ready
- # There's a train a-comin'

970
01:03:20,353 --> 01:03:22,787
# You don't need no baggage

971
01:03:22,856 --> 01:03:25,757
# You just get on board

972
01:03:27,393 --> 01:03:29,190
# All you need is faith

973
01:03:29,262 --> 01:03:33,062
# To hear the diesels hummin'

974
01:03:33,133 --> 01:03:35,863
# Don't need no ticket

975
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:38,927
# You just thank the Lord

976
01:03:47,547 --> 01:03:49,538
# So. People. Get ready

977
01:03:49,616 --> 01:03:53,143
# For the train to Jordan

978
01:03:54,387 --> 01:03:56,651
# Picking up passengers

979
01:03:56,723 --> 01:03:59,658
# Coast to coast

980
01:03:59,726 --> 01:04:04,459
- You got basketball on your mind, Hill?
- Yeah, Coach. Nothing but.

981
01:04:07,333 --> 01:04:10,894
Coach Haskins. Matt Pavelar,
Dallas Morning News.

982
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:12,665
You're playing a lot of coloreds.

983
01:04:12,739 --> 01:04:16,800
Are you concerned as to whether
the Negro player can handle the pressure

984
01:04:16,876 --> 01:04:19,777
at the national level?

985
01:04:19,846 --> 01:04:22,280
My team plays defense, rebounds.

986
01:04:22,348 --> 01:04:26,580
- (Matt) What statement are you making?
- I'm a coach. I don't make statements.

987
01:04:26,653 --> 01:04:30,089
- (man) Kentucky's here.
- Thank you, Coach.

988
01:04:30,857 --> 01:04:32,518
Coach Rupp. Coach Rupp.

989
01:04:32,592 --> 01:04:34,583
Coach Rupp. Coach Rupp!

990
01:04:34,661 --> 01:04:36,151
(overlapping chatter)

991
01:04:36,229 --> 01:04:40,859
Coach Rupp, great game. Take us to the
last 20 seconds. What'd you tell the boys?

992
01:04:40,934 --> 01:04:43,425
(Rupp) I knew it was 20 seconds.
I gave them a good play.

993
01:04:43,503 --> 01:04:48,702
Something in our playbook we used for
years. The boys performed it to perfection.

994
01:04:48,775 --> 01:04:50,538
I'm gonna introduce myself.

995
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:52,976
...and I know you're gonna let me go.

996
01:04:53,046 --> 01:04:54,809
- Figures.
- Thank you, Coach.

997
01:04:55,415 --> 01:04:57,713
- Coach.
- No more interviews. Thank you.

998
01:04:57,784 --> 01:05:01,447
Don Haskins.
I'm the coach over at Texas Western.

999
01:05:03,089 --> 01:05:05,148
Just wanted to introduce myself.

1000
01:05:05,225 --> 01:05:08,661
Congratulate you
on another great year and...

1001
01:05:08,728 --> 01:05:11,322
- These your boys?
- Yes, sir.

1002
01:05:11,397 --> 01:05:13,695
Yes, sir, my players.

1003
01:05:15,802 --> 01:05:19,704
Well, you had a fine season.
See you down the road.

1004
01:05:26,613 --> 01:05:28,376
(booing)

1005
01:05:28,448 --> 01:05:32,544
- (man) Losers!
- (man #2) We don't want your kind!

1006
01:05:32,619 --> 01:05:35,782
Ignore all this trash!
Just get out on the court.

1007
01:05:35,855 --> 01:05:37,880
(heckler) Don't you come in here!

1008
01:05:37,957 --> 01:05:40,949
(heckler #2) Look at all
these stupid kids!

1009
01:05:42,695 --> 01:05:45,186
Let go of me, boy!

1010
01:05:45,265 --> 01:05:48,200
(Armstrong) Don't listen to 'em.
Come on, focus.

1011
01:05:48,268 --> 01:05:51,533
- That's easy for you say.
- Don't listen to 'em.

1012
01:05:52,472 --> 01:05:56,169
In spite of a hostile crowd.
The Miners have played well tonight

1013
01:05:56,242 --> 01:05:58,107
as they look to close out East Texas.

1014
01:05:58,177 --> 01:06:02,511
And there's a block. And a fast break
opportunity for the Lions.

1015
01:06:02,582 --> 01:06:05,016
And Jason Stevens puts it up for two.

1016
01:06:05,084 --> 01:06:09,487
Could have been in a Miners' uniform
if Coach had been able to recruit him.

1017
01:06:09,555 --> 01:06:12,683
I see Coach must be clearing the bench,
huh?

1018
01:06:13,393 --> 01:06:18,456
And Stevens. With the hot hand here in the
second half. Being guarded by Baudoin.

1019
01:06:23,269 --> 01:06:24,964
Coach sends his best.

1020
01:06:25,038 --> 01:06:30,408
This has been a hard-fought game
on both sides. Miners lead by five.

1021
01:06:30,476 --> 01:06:33,343
Takes it in to Big Daddy.
Who's pushed to the floor!

1022
01:06:33,413 --> 01:06:35,313
- Are you kiddin' me?
- It is getting rough.

1023
01:06:35,381 --> 01:06:39,147
Let's see who the foul's on.
They call it on Lattin! I can't believe this!

1024
01:06:39,218 --> 01:06:41,345
Lattin's gotta watch his temper here.

1025
01:06:41,421 --> 01:06:44,788
He's already fouled
out of ten games this year.

1026
01:06:44,857 --> 01:06:47,189
(referee) Technical foul.

1027
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:50,423
Just sit down. You never let your anger
get the better of you.

1028
01:06:50,496 --> 01:06:51,963
- He stuck his knee out!
- I know.

1029
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:56,559
- Lattin's temper is gonna cost the Miners.
- You gotta hold yourself together.

1030
01:06:56,636 --> 01:06:59,867
- He's sticking his knee out!
- You hold yourself together.

1031
01:06:59,939 --> 01:07:04,433
Keep that anger inside you and I'll let you
know when you can let it go, understand?

1032
01:07:06,212 --> 01:07:09,045
At the beginning of the season.
No one could have imagined

1033
01:07:09,115 --> 01:07:11,310
that we would wind up
where we are now:

1034
01:07:11,384 --> 01:07:13,682
Number four in the nation.

1035
01:07:13,753 --> 01:07:17,416
Close on the heels of powerhouses
like Kentucky and Kansas.

1036
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:20,857
Now. With two weeks to go
before the NCAA tournament starts.

1037
01:07:20,927 --> 01:07:23,020
We're not a secret anymore.

1038
01:07:28,101 --> 01:07:30,934
(chatter)

1039
01:07:31,004 --> 01:07:32,995
Been this cold before.

1040
01:07:41,714 --> 01:07:43,682
Man!

1041
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:45,877
Ross, Coach, hurry!

1042
01:07:57,930 --> 01:08:01,525
- (Ross) Oh, man.
- (Don) Moe, get us checked out.

1043
01:08:03,269 --> 01:08:07,171
Listen, we're gonna get on the bus
and go to Seattle tonight, all right?

1044
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:10,334
Get your stuff, pack up
and let's get on the bus.

1045
01:08:15,481 --> 01:08:17,415
Hey, man.

1046
01:08:17,483 --> 01:08:19,781
You ever get scared?

1047
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:27,024
When I was a kid in Houston...

1048
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:33,421
a white gang strung me on a fire escape
till I peed my pants.

1049
01:08:35,401 --> 01:08:37,699
I came back down and...

1050
01:08:39,238 --> 01:08:41,934
took nothing from nobody ever again.

1051
01:08:43,109 --> 01:08:47,546
Took it to every honky on the block...

1052
01:08:47,613 --> 01:08:51,014
till they left Big Daddy D alone.

1053
01:08:54,554 --> 01:08:58,046
But this is different.

1054
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:02,059
This is worse.

1055
01:09:06,499 --> 01:09:08,933
This is the whole world.

1056
01:09:09,836 --> 01:09:15,240
- Everything all right, Coach?
- Oh, what'd I get these guys into, Ross?

1057
01:09:18,478 --> 01:09:21,379
You did the right thing.

1058
01:09:21,447 --> 01:09:25,941
You think about what these boys had
to overcome just to get here.

1059
01:09:26,018 --> 01:09:32,355
You think about how they've been
degraded and humiliated,

1060
01:09:32,425 --> 01:09:36,623
just 'cause they black,
by all these "civilized" folks.

1061
01:09:38,364 --> 01:09:41,458
- Shame on us.
- (thunder rumbles)

1062
01:09:42,535 --> 01:09:46,995
WTSM. 1380 broadcasting live
from Seattle. Washington.

1063
01:09:47,073 --> 01:09:51,908
Hi, Miners fans. Thanks for joining us
at a packed house in the Pacific Northwest.

1064
01:09:51,978 --> 01:09:56,540
The question: Will the Miners. In the last
regular season game here in Seattle.

1065
01:09:56,616 --> 01:10:00,347
Take the number-one spot
in the NC 2A polls?

1066
01:10:00,419 --> 01:10:06,153
Adolph Rupp's fabled Wildcats dropped
a nail-biter to Tennessee last night.

1067
01:10:06,225 --> 01:10:09,661
And that will allow the Miners.
If they win here tonight.

1068
01:10:09,729 --> 01:10:12,562
To take the number-one spot
in the nation.

1069
01:10:13,966 --> 01:10:18,630
Hey, Lattin, you didn't jump high enough
to get toilet paper under your shoe.

1070
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:22,269
The Chieftains go down
for an easy lay-up.

1071
01:10:22,341 --> 01:10:26,277
Miners making it a little too easy
for the Chieftains at this point.

1072
01:10:26,345 --> 01:10:28,245
Armstrong down low.

1073
01:10:28,314 --> 01:10:33,877
Armstrong's wide open. Flournoy looks
down there. Will not pass the ball.

1074
01:10:33,953 --> 01:10:36,888
He wants to go it alone.
Launches a 20-footer. It's off the mark.

1075
01:10:36,956 --> 01:10:39,049
Come on, man, I was wide open.

1076
01:10:46,199 --> 01:10:47,689
Hill, we're in orange tonight.

1077
01:10:47,767 --> 01:10:51,168
- Come on, Shed, meet the pass.
- Don't worry about me.

1078
01:10:57,910 --> 01:10:59,707
The Miners are just playing flat.

1079
01:10:59,779 --> 01:11:01,906
Your guy just got by you, Hill.

1080
01:11:01,981 --> 01:11:05,883
There's no chemistry. No energy.
It's every man for themselves out there.

1081
01:11:05,952 --> 01:11:09,888
They're not playing like a team.
That jump was no good.

1082
01:11:14,794 --> 01:11:18,924
- Coach, you're in my chair.
- I like the view better down here.

1083
01:11:20,633 --> 01:11:22,897
Eight minutes to play.
And I hate to say this.

1084
01:11:22,969 --> 01:11:25,995
But it looks like
our Miners have given up.

1085
01:11:36,649 --> 01:11:38,344
(no audio)

1086
01:11:38,417 --> 01:11:40,408
They've got only themselves
to blame.

1087
01:11:40,486 --> 01:11:42,920
They didn't play together
or find the open man.

1088
01:11:42,989 --> 01:11:47,119
And the Miners' perfect season
is slipping away.

1089
01:11:49,462 --> 01:11:52,158
(woman humming)

1090
01:12:07,947 --> 01:12:09,244
Ohh!

1091
01:12:14,353 --> 01:12:17,220
(buzzer signals end of the game)

1092
01:12:21,627 --> 01:12:24,061
You stunk out there tonight!

1093
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:27,588
Squeaky could have played better D
than you did.

1094
01:12:27,667 --> 01:12:30,431
And, Shed, are you kiddin' me?

1095
01:12:30,503 --> 01:12:34,599
That was the same ol' weak,
scared Shed out there.

1096
01:12:34,674 --> 01:12:39,839
Maybe you thought what used to be
an undefeated record meant something.

1097
01:12:39,912 --> 01:12:42,540
That we could just waltz
our way in the tournament.

1098
01:12:42,615 --> 01:12:46,711
- Maybe these crackers is getting to us.
- Why you looking at me, Bobby Joe?

1099
01:12:46,786 --> 01:12:49,584
You a cracker, ain't you?

1100
01:12:49,655 --> 01:12:52,954
Coach, the more we win,
the harder it is for us out there.

1101
01:12:53,025 --> 01:12:56,517
What do you suggest we do, Shed?
Lose?

1102
01:12:56,595 --> 01:12:58,426
Give them what they want?

1103
01:12:58,497 --> 01:13:02,490
You think basketball is everything, Coach.
And that's easy for you to say.

1104
01:13:02,568 --> 01:13:05,366
But you don't have rednecks
in your face all the time.

1105
01:13:05,438 --> 01:13:10,603
None of you white boys get it because you
don't have people breaking into your room

1106
01:13:10,676 --> 01:13:12,303
or shoving your head in toilets.

1107
01:13:12,378 --> 01:13:13,777
(Armstrong) It's not us.

1108
01:13:13,846 --> 01:13:16,747
White is white, Green Acres,
and that means you too.

1109
01:13:16,816 --> 01:13:21,082
Yeah, I'm white. And you've never been
able to see past that! We're not like them!

1110
01:13:21,153 --> 01:13:24,145
Think we haven't had heat
come down on us?

1111
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:27,954
You're the ones out there skating by,
while we're out there sweating blood.

1112
01:13:28,027 --> 01:13:33,329
You think it's easy being on this team?
Taking a backseat to you every day?

1113
01:13:33,399 --> 01:13:37,165
We came here to play basketball,
just like you guys!

1114
01:13:37,236 --> 01:13:40,535
Now it's like we don't even count.
We're the minority!

1115
01:13:40,606 --> 01:13:44,975
I don't wanna hear that from you. I have
been the minority every day of my life.

1116
01:13:45,044 --> 01:13:50,414
And you're crying because you spent
the last few months in our shadows?

1117
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:57,480
Welcome to the back of the bus,
white boy.

1118
01:13:57,556 --> 01:14:02,220
I wish y'all would just sit back here
and listen to yourselves.

1119
01:14:02,895 --> 01:14:09,767
It's worse than losing the game.
You've all forgotten what you're doing here.

1120
01:14:12,271 --> 01:14:16,207
What do you wanna do?
You wanna quit?

1121
01:14:16,275 --> 01:14:21,076
- They're trying to take our dignity from us.
- Your dignity's inside you.

1122
01:14:21,147 --> 01:14:25,083
Nobody can take something away from you
you don't give them.

1123
01:14:26,218 --> 01:14:27,446
Hey.

1124
01:14:29,522 --> 01:14:31,615
Hold your heads up.

1125
01:14:33,192 --> 01:14:35,558
Hold your heads up.

1126
01:14:36,162 --> 01:14:38,687
You wanna shake off that hate?

1127
01:14:41,567 --> 01:14:46,561
It's your choice, Harry Flournoy.
It's your choice, Jerry Armstrong.

1128
01:14:46,639 --> 01:14:48,334
Togo.

1129
01:14:48,407 --> 01:14:51,274
Cager, Hill, it's your choice.

1130
01:14:51,343 --> 01:14:53,971
Shut them up.

1131
01:14:54,046 --> 01:14:55,445
Win.

1132
01:14:56,382 --> 01:14:58,976
The NCAA Tournament gets off
to a rip-roaring start

1133
01:14:59,051 --> 01:15:03,317
as the powerhouse Kansas Jayhawks
take on the upstart Texas Western Miners.

1134
01:15:03,389 --> 01:15:06,415
(Cager) Thank you
for keeping us together.

1135
01:15:06,492 --> 01:15:10,929
Lord, we ask that you see us through,
no matter what the obstacles.

1136
01:15:10,996 --> 01:15:13,794
No matter how high the mountains.

1137
01:15:14,767 --> 01:15:17,634
- Amen.
- (all) Amen.

1138
01:15:17,703 --> 01:15:19,967
(Cager) Let's go, guys.
Let's get this game.

1139
01:15:19,971 --> 01:15:24,601
While the Texas Western club has turned
heads across the country with this roster,

1140
01:15:24,676 --> 01:15:27,736
it's safe to say that Haskins' experiment
should end tonight.

1141
01:15:37,822 --> 01:15:40,655
- Coach?
- You must be Mrs. Cager.

1142
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:46,920
- Thanks for seeing me before the game.
- I know you come a long way, so...

1143
01:15:46,998 --> 01:15:50,525
You have too.
You know, you're all he talks about.

1144
01:15:51,169 --> 01:15:56,698
"Coach said this" and "Coach said that."
So I said, "Let me meet this man."

1145
01:15:56,775 --> 01:16:00,267
Well, Mrs. Cager, your son's
all a coach could ever ask for.

1146
01:16:00,345 --> 01:16:03,712
He's hard working, he's unselfish.

1147
01:16:03,782 --> 01:16:08,947
Tell you the truth, I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for Willie.

1148
01:16:09,621 --> 01:16:13,148
Mr. Haskins, I came to ask you
to let him play.

1149
01:16:17,162 --> 01:16:20,791
Mrs. Cager, the thing is,
his condition is just...

1150
01:16:20,865 --> 01:16:24,130
I know about it better than anyone.

1151
01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:28,530
This is his time.

1152
01:16:28,606 --> 01:16:31,905
These are the last games
he'll ever play.

1153
01:16:33,078 --> 01:16:36,946
I don't care if it's just five minutes
or five seconds.

1154
01:16:37,015 --> 01:16:40,917
Just... let him play.

1155
01:16:45,957 --> 01:16:49,654
Led by all-American JoJo White.
The number-six Jayhawks are. With Duke.

1156
01:16:49,728 --> 01:16:54,165
The favorites to challenge Rupp and
Kentucky for basketball's holy grail.

1157
01:16:54,232 --> 01:16:56,257
That's the all-American.

1158
01:16:56,334 --> 01:16:58,598
All press clippings.

1159
01:16:58,670 --> 01:17:01,764
- Think so?
- He's all talk too.

1160
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:05,276
(cheerleaders cheer in background)

1161
01:17:16,087 --> 01:17:21,548
Bobby Joe Hill will set up
the Texas Miner offense in the front court.

1162
01:17:22,227 --> 01:17:24,058
Stolen! JoJo White.

1163
01:17:24,129 --> 01:17:26,597
(commentator #2) Tremendous
anticipation defensively by White.

1164
01:17:26,664 --> 01:17:29,633
Easy pass and a dunk,
and a four-nothing Jayhawk lead.

1165
01:17:29,701 --> 01:17:32,670
You gotta protect the ball, Hill!

1166
01:17:32,737 --> 01:17:34,728
Ball in to Wesley.

1167
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,374
He just overpowers Lattin.

1168
01:17:37,442 --> 01:17:40,741
(commentator #2) Wesley trying to
intimidate Lattin early on in the game.

1169
01:17:40,812 --> 01:17:43,007
(crowd) Defense! Defense!

1170
01:17:45,183 --> 01:17:47,981
(commentator) White extends
the Jayhawk lead to five.

1171
01:17:48,053 --> 01:17:51,750
(commentator #2) But more importantly
now Kansas has all the momentum.

1172
01:17:51,823 --> 01:17:54,986
(commentator) It looks like Haskins
is going to go to his bench.

1173
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:56,925
He's calling for Willie Cager.

1174
01:17:56,995 --> 01:18:00,123
(commentator #2) Cager missed
half the season with heart problems.

1175
01:18:00,198 --> 01:18:03,599
But the Miners sure could use
a lift right now.

1176
01:18:06,404 --> 01:18:09,271
(commentator) Now Cager
from the top of the key.

1177
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:10,830
It's good!

1178
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:16,440
Hey, welcome home, son! That's a good
play, Cager! Way to be out there!

1179
01:18:16,514 --> 01:18:18,505
- That's my son.
- Plays good.

1180
01:18:20,185 --> 01:18:23,621
(commentator #2) JoJo White
into the front court. 22-footer.

1181
01:18:23,688 --> 01:18:25,178
It's good!

1182
01:18:25,256 --> 01:18:27,884
Bobby Joe Hill looking to answer
for the Miners.

1183
01:18:27,959 --> 01:18:29,017
And he'll score!

1184
01:18:29,094 --> 01:18:33,190
(commentator #2) And these two point
guards are really putting on a show.

1185
01:18:33,264 --> 01:18:36,995
(commentator) It's JoJo's turn.
From the wing. He looks unstoppable!

1186
01:18:37,068 --> 01:18:38,763
And Coach Haskins calls time.

1187
01:18:38,837 --> 01:18:42,796
Y'all are paying so much attention
to their jerseys that you're playing tight.

1188
01:18:42,874 --> 01:18:47,538
JoJo's having a big night, so I'm making a
change. Armstrong, you're in for Worsley.

1189
01:18:47,612 --> 01:18:51,275
Now, if you can stop him, bottom line is
we're gonna win this game.

1190
01:18:51,349 --> 01:18:54,716
- Don't worry. I'll take care of him.
- Let's go to work.

1191
01:18:54,786 --> 01:18:56,777
On three.

1192
01:18:56,855 --> 01:18:58,584
- Let's go, team.
- One, two, three!

1193
01:18:58,656 --> 01:19:00,180
Miners!

1194
01:19:10,201 --> 01:19:11,532
That's good D, son.

1195
01:19:12,637 --> 01:19:17,131
(commentator) Lattin. Back door to Shed.
And he'll lay it in for two.

1196
01:19:23,548 --> 01:19:25,243
(grumbles)

1197
01:19:27,819 --> 01:19:31,516
(commentator #2) Here in the second half.
Armstrong has shut down JoJo White.

1198
01:19:31,589 --> 01:19:34,490
We need a stop!
We need a stop!

1199
01:19:37,362 --> 01:19:40,229
(commentator) Kansas scores.
And they lead by two!

1200
01:19:40,298 --> 01:19:42,596
- Seven seconds! Push the ball!
- Seven seconds!

1201
01:19:42,667 --> 01:19:45,158
No time-outs for the Miners!

1202
01:19:50,008 --> 01:19:52,636
Long inbound to Lattin.

1203
01:19:52,710 --> 01:19:56,544
Back out to Hill. To the basket!

1204
01:19:56,614 --> 01:19:58,514
Cager! He got it!

1205
01:19:59,918 --> 01:20:01,613
(commentator #2) What a play!

1206
01:20:01,686 --> 01:20:06,055
He wasn't expected to play tonight.
But he saved the season for the Miners!

1207
01:20:06,124 --> 01:20:10,686
Overtime! Hey, you got an overtime!
Hey, get in here! We got an overtime!

1208
01:20:10,762 --> 01:20:14,630
(commentator #2) And we'll play overtime
to settle this one!

1209
01:20:19,637 --> 01:20:21,798
That's the way to go! That's it!

1210
01:20:25,076 --> 01:20:28,534
(commentator) Just seconds remaining.

1211
01:20:28,613 --> 01:20:30,604
Artis. Up to Lattin.

1212
01:20:30,682 --> 01:20:34,584
It's good! And the Miners win!
The Miners win!

1213
01:20:34,652 --> 01:20:39,180
(commentator #2) They're calling it
hanging on the rim! I can't believe it!

1214
01:20:39,257 --> 01:20:42,226
(commentator) A foul called
against David Lattin.

1215
01:20:42,293 --> 01:20:45,524
The basket will count
and Kansas will shoot two free throws

1216
01:20:45,597 --> 01:20:48,589
to try to send the game
to a second overtime.

1217
01:21:05,516 --> 01:21:09,282
(commentator) JoJo makes both.
And we're going to a second overtime.

1218
01:21:09,354 --> 01:21:10,946
All right, bring it in!

1219
01:21:11,022 --> 01:21:13,616
Oh. Is this a game for the record books!

1220
01:21:13,691 --> 01:21:15,625
We got a great mismatch, a little low.

1221
01:21:15,693 --> 01:21:19,288
So we're gonna swing in the ball
and let him take his man one on one.

1222
01:21:19,364 --> 01:21:21,195
You got it? All right, let's do it.

1223
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:24,301
(buzzer signals start of second overtime)

1224
01:21:24,369 --> 01:21:29,363
OK, here we go. The winner moves on
for the national championship.

1225
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:32,034
Lattin. Cross-court pass to Artis.

1226
01:21:32,110 --> 01:21:34,670
He'll drive the baseline and score!

1227
01:21:34,746 --> 01:21:38,341
The Jayhawk defender really bit
on that fake. And the Miners lead by one.

1228
01:21:38,416 --> 01:21:40,884
Kansas needs a basket to win.
Where they going?

1229
01:21:40,952 --> 01:21:43,819
(commentator #2) Everyone knows
who will take this shot -

1230
01:21:43,888 --> 01:21:46,550
it's their all-American JoJo White.

1231
01:21:49,694 --> 01:21:52,492
(commentator) Ball goes in to JoJo!

1232
01:21:52,563 --> 01:21:54,326
From the sideline!

1233
01:21:56,301 --> 01:22:00,067
It's good! Kansas wins! Kansas wins!

1234
01:22:03,908 --> 01:22:07,935
(commentator #2) Wait a minute. Ralph!
It looks like he stepped on the line.

1235
01:22:08,012 --> 01:22:10,810
I think the official's going
to wave the basket off.

1236
01:22:10,882 --> 01:22:16,047
(commentator) It's no good! And Texas
Western's improbable story continues

1237
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:20,580
with an 81-80 double overtime win
over the Kansas Jayhawks.

1238
01:22:28,066 --> 01:22:30,694
Have you seen this?
Have you read this already?

1239
01:22:30,768 --> 01:22:31,962
(Don) I read it.

1240
01:22:32,036 --> 01:22:36,302
It says, "The selfless support of Texas
Western's booster Wade Richardsons,

1241
01:22:36,374 --> 01:22:40,902
which has made this breakout team's rise
a true phenomenon in the sports world."

1242
01:22:40,978 --> 01:22:44,379
Well, they got you down,
didn't they, sir?

1243
01:22:44,449 --> 01:22:46,849
Just forget all that stuff I said before.

1244
01:22:46,918 --> 01:22:51,514
I've been selling more dinettes than
I've sold in the last four years combined.

1245
01:22:51,589 --> 01:22:54,490
(overlapping chatter)

1246
01:22:54,559 --> 01:22:58,893
You're 24 hours from the biggest game
in college basketball. How do you feel?

1247
01:22:58,963 --> 01:23:00,726
You know, I've been here before.

1248
01:23:00,798 --> 01:23:03,596
It's been some time now,
but I've had some success here

1249
01:23:03,668 --> 01:23:06,762
and I feel like I'm coming home, really.

1250
01:23:06,838 --> 01:23:09,068
I'm just glad to be here.

1251
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:12,132
I'd like to ask you
about your controversial win over Kansas.

1252
01:23:12,210 --> 01:23:17,807
There's no controversy. JoJo White
stepped out of bounds. They lost, we won.

1253
01:23:26,524 --> 01:23:30,824
Coach Haskins, how do you plan on
stopping Louie Dampier and Pat Riley?

1254
01:23:30,895 --> 01:23:34,854
Ask Coach Rupp how he plans on
stopping David Lattin and Bobby Joe Hill.

1255
01:23:34,932 --> 01:23:35,899
Who?

1256
01:23:35,967 --> 01:23:37,559
(reporters chuckle)

1257
01:23:37,635 --> 01:23:39,262
You have to admit. Coach Rupp.

1258
01:23:39,337 --> 01:23:43,398
That the Negro player is changing
the game of basketball.

1259
01:23:43,474 --> 01:23:44,463
Oh?

1260
01:23:44,542 --> 01:23:51,243
Well, as far as I know, basketball's about
taking the basketball, putting it in the hoop.

1261
01:23:51,816 --> 01:23:56,344
And you can quote me.
I don't think that's going to change.

1262
01:23:56,421 --> 01:23:59,185
(woman) That horrible man,
playing those coloreds.

1263
01:23:59,257 --> 01:24:01,817
And where are you from, sweetheart?

1264
01:24:01,893 --> 01:24:06,557
El Paso, Texas. I'm married to that
horrible man you were just talking about.

1265
01:24:06,631 --> 01:24:10,931
Coach Rupp, what do you think of their
lightning-quick guard, Bobby Joe Hill?

1266
01:24:11,002 --> 01:24:14,597
He's a good boy. But there's lots
of good boys out there this year.

1267
01:24:14,672 --> 01:24:17,732
Well. This good little boy led us
to 23 and one.

1268
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:21,642
Well, I think you understood my point.

1269
01:24:21,712 --> 01:24:27,116
My point is that we at Kentucky don't worry
about the boys in other uniforms.

1270
01:24:27,185 --> 01:24:28,675
We play our game.

1271
01:24:31,656 --> 01:24:37,151
Don't pay them any mind.
It's just how some people were raised.

1272
01:24:37,228 --> 01:24:40,026
Well, they weren't raised right.

1273
01:24:40,097 --> 01:24:42,292
I guess not.

1274
01:24:43,901 --> 01:24:47,234
But not everybody thinks like that.

1275
01:24:48,573 --> 01:24:51,508
My name is Esther.

1276
01:24:51,576 --> 01:24:53,669
Esther Rupp.

1277
01:24:54,378 --> 01:24:59,008
Nice to meet you. Mary Haskins.

1278
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:02,949
Let's get this game over with
so we can get back to Memphis.

1279
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:07,719
Well, one thing's for sure -
can't no five niggers beat five white boys.

1280
01:25:08,693 --> 01:25:12,993
Yeah. Just black trash, that's all they are.
They think they belong here.

1281
01:25:13,064 --> 01:25:14,497
Harris. That's enough.

1282
01:25:14,565 --> 01:25:18,228
- Wait, I'm just getting started here. Hold it.
- (laughter)

1283
01:25:18,736 --> 01:25:22,832
(Don) Maybe old Coach Rupp still
has a thing to learn about basketball.

1284
01:25:22,907 --> 01:25:27,037
These boys are playing
for more than just the championship.

1285
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:31,810
When I came here...

1286
01:25:34,585 --> 01:25:36,849
I didn't wanna come.

1287
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:41,723
I didn't wanna be a part of this.

1288
01:25:43,227 --> 01:25:45,752
But I was wrong, Don.

1289
01:25:46,797 --> 01:25:48,958
I was wrong.

1290
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:43,882
You know, my dad called.

1291
01:26:43,955 --> 01:26:49,723
He said everybody in town's going to
Thelma's Steakhouse to watch the game.

1292
01:26:53,264 --> 01:26:55,755
He said he was proud of me.

1293
01:26:55,833 --> 01:27:01,271
It was always just a game to me. But now
it feels like a lot more than a game.

1294
01:27:01,339 --> 01:27:06,367
Yeah, I know what you mean, brother.
Feels like my whole life.

1295
01:27:06,444 --> 01:27:10,403
My folks are driving down
with Willie's parents.

1296
01:27:10,481 --> 01:27:13,814
My old man's coming too.

1297
01:27:13,884 --> 01:27:20,687
He was always a baseball fan.
But I think he's finally liking basketball.

1298
01:27:20,758 --> 01:27:23,158
Bobby Joe. You hear me, man?

1299
01:27:24,095 --> 01:27:28,156
This ain't gonna be nothing.
It's just a day at the playground.

1300
01:27:28,232 --> 01:27:30,223
(telephone ringing)

1301
01:27:35,506 --> 01:27:36,632
Hello?

1302
01:27:44,482 --> 01:27:46,848
Take a look out there.

1303
01:27:47,852 --> 01:27:50,412
We can't win tomorrow night.

1304
01:27:52,523 --> 01:27:55,390
You're not a championship team.

1305
01:27:56,327 --> 01:28:01,060
You've been lucky so far,
but tomorrow your luck's gonna run out.

1306
01:28:04,001 --> 01:28:07,164
To win at this level, you gotta have a...

1307
01:28:09,707 --> 01:28:13,438
intelligence inside you out on that court.

1308
01:28:14,245 --> 01:28:16,645
You gotta be able to think.

1309
01:28:16,714 --> 01:28:20,115
We just got too much
of the wrong complexion.

1310
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:26,055
You're athletes, sure.

1311
01:28:26,123 --> 01:28:29,149
But so are monkeys.

1312
01:28:31,996 --> 01:28:33,054
Mm-hm.

1313
01:28:33,130 --> 01:28:35,963
You can run. You can jump.

1314
01:28:36,033 --> 01:28:39,696
Maybe even hit the occasional outside shot
with the right training,

1315
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:42,568
but to compete against a real team...

1316
01:28:46,177 --> 01:28:53,083
Well, should I go on, or you as sick
of this same old tired line of BS as I am?

1317
01:28:57,888 --> 01:29:03,884
I'm so sick of it, tonight I made a decision
that we're gonna put a stop to it forever.

1318
01:29:07,331 --> 01:29:09,765
Lattin.

1319
01:29:09,834 --> 01:29:11,324
Flournoy.

1320
01:29:11,402 --> 01:29:13,962
Artis, Cager, Worsley, Hill.

1321
01:29:15,506 --> 01:29:16,666
Shed.

1322
01:29:19,477 --> 01:29:22,002
Five starters, two subs.

1323
01:29:22,079 --> 01:29:24,138
40 minutes, seven players.

1324
01:29:24,215 --> 01:29:29,084
I'm only gonna play the black players
in the final game tomorrow.

1325
01:29:29,153 --> 01:29:31,383
Just you.

1326
01:29:31,455 --> 01:29:33,821
Togo, Armstrong, Palacio,

1327
01:29:33,891 --> 01:29:36,359
Myers, Baudoin.

1328
01:29:37,394 --> 01:29:41,558
I know how hard every one of you worked
to get here. I don't wanna hurt any of you.

1329
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:44,931
Coach. I can't lie.

1330
01:29:45,002 --> 01:29:47,197
I wanna play.

1331
01:29:48,105 --> 01:29:50,938
I do. We all wanna play.

1332
01:29:54,645 --> 01:29:58,604
But I just wanna say one thing.

1333
01:30:01,452 --> 01:30:03,443
Tomorrow night,

1334
01:30:03,521 --> 01:30:10,324
y'all go out there and show 'em how bad
five brothers can be on the court.

1335
01:30:12,763 --> 01:30:14,754
OK?

1336
01:30:16,967 --> 01:30:22,303
Flournoy, if you don't get back and play
defense, I'll be all over your black butt.

1337
01:30:33,984 --> 01:30:37,215
Good evening and welcome
to the Cole Field House for the finals

1338
01:30:37,288 --> 01:30:39,813
of the NCAA Championship game

1339
01:30:39,890 --> 01:30:44,987
between the University of Kentucky
and Texas Western College.

1340
01:30:45,062 --> 01:30:47,553
And here come the Miners.

1341
01:30:57,775 --> 01:31:00,573
When this tournament began.
Virtually everybody

1342
01:31:00,644 --> 01:31:02,612
could have predicted one of our finalists.

1343
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:05,478
But I don't think anyone
could have predicted the other.

1344
01:31:05,549 --> 01:31:09,110
It's Texas Western College
against the University of Kentucky

1345
01:31:09,186 --> 01:31:11,711
for the NCAA Championship.

1346
01:31:11,789 --> 01:31:14,417
A little mining college from
out in West Texas.

1347
01:31:14,491 --> 01:31:18,552
A scrappy bunch with an unusual lineup
going against basketball royalty.

1348
01:31:18,629 --> 01:31:23,066
The Baron of the Bluegrass
and his four NCAA men's championships.

1349
01:31:23,133 --> 01:31:25,931
If there was ever more of a mismatch,
I don't remember it.

1350
01:31:26,003 --> 01:31:29,336
Here's tonight's starting lineup
for the Kentucky Wildcats.

1351
01:31:29,406 --> 01:31:32,569
At guard number 30, six-three,
Tommy Kron.

1352
01:31:32,643 --> 01:31:35,043
The Cats are led
by two great all-Americans.

1353
01:31:35,112 --> 01:31:40,106
First of all. Sharp-shooting Louie Dampier
and the high-scoring Pat Riley.

1354
01:31:40,184 --> 01:31:42,345
These guys play with speed.

1355
01:31:42,419 --> 01:31:46,321
They play with poise
and they play with intelligence.

1356
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:50,121
(announcer) And the coach of
the Kentucky Wildcats. Adolph Rupp.

1357
01:31:50,194 --> 01:31:54,597
Now here's the starting lineup
for the Texas Western Miners.

1358
01:31:54,665 --> 01:31:59,830
At guard. Out of Detroit. Michigan.
Number 14. five-ten. Bobby Joe Hill.

1359
01:31:59,904 --> 01:32:03,965
At the other guard, number 24,
five-six Willie Worsley.

1360
01:32:04,041 --> 01:32:09,035
At center. From Houston. Texas.
Number 43. six-seven. David Lattin.

1361
01:32:09,113 --> 01:32:12,844
At forward. Number 44. six-five.
Harry Flournoy.

1362
01:32:12,917 --> 01:32:16,045
At the other forward. Number 20.
Orsten Artis.

1363
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:20,022
And the coach of the Texas Western
Miners. Don Haskins.

1364
01:32:20,090 --> 01:32:22,957
(commentator) We have a
David-versus-Goliath match-up.

1365
01:32:23,027 --> 01:32:27,327
Texas Western against Kentucky
for the NCAA Championship.

1366
01:32:27,398 --> 01:32:30,697
You had a great season, Coach.
You must be thrilled to be here.

1367
01:32:33,137 --> 01:32:35,401
- One, two, three.
- (all) Miners!

1368
01:32:36,307 --> 01:32:39,037
You three guards are in there
to stop their fast break.

1369
01:32:39,109 --> 01:32:41,202
Make them have to walk it down the court.

1370
01:32:41,278 --> 01:32:44,714
You saw who they put on the floor.
They're gonna try to run against us.

1371
01:32:44,782 --> 01:32:48,980
In an unprecedented move, Coach
Haskins is starting five Negro players.

1372
01:32:49,053 --> 01:32:52,682
- That's a spit in the face.
- A first in NCAA Championship history.

1373
01:32:52,756 --> 01:32:56,920
Now I want you to get angry. Go out there
first time you get the ball and dunk it.

1374
01:32:56,994 --> 01:32:59,963
I don't care if you have
to run someone over to do it.

1375
01:33:00,030 --> 01:33:01,793
We're faster.
We can spit right back.

1376
01:33:01,865 --> 01:33:03,526
Send 'em a message. Get in there.

1377
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,330
They're the one that got a chip
on their shoulder, not us.

1378
01:33:06,403 --> 01:33:09,429
It ain't about nothing except basketball.
One, two, three!

1379
01:33:09,506 --> 01:33:10,996
Miners!

1380
01:33:11,075 --> 01:33:14,977
Dampier's a great ball handler. You try
to take it from him, he's gonna burn you.

1381
01:33:15,045 --> 01:33:17,809
- Come on, Coach.
- Some say he's the best guard.

1382
01:33:17,881 --> 01:33:20,782
If I had a choice between him and you,
I'd choose you.

1383
01:33:20,851 --> 01:33:23,843
That's good, 'cause you know
he wouldn't have chose me.

1384
01:33:23,921 --> 01:33:25,218
(horn blows)

1385
01:33:25,422 --> 01:33:26,912
(cheering)

1386
01:33:30,027 --> 01:33:33,690
The opening tap.
Big David Lattin against Pat Riley.

1387
01:33:38,335 --> 01:33:41,133
And the tap is controlled
by Texas Western.

1388
01:33:41,205 --> 01:33:45,403
Worsley gives it to Bobby Joe Hill.
Now Hill rockets a pass into Lattin.

1389
01:33:45,476 --> 01:33:47,341
And he dunks it over Riley.

1390
01:33:47,411 --> 01:33:49,572
Aah!

1391
01:33:49,646 --> 01:33:50,704
Yeah!

1392
01:33:50,781 --> 01:33:52,874
(cheering)

1393
01:33:52,950 --> 01:33:57,387
- He was making a statement with that.
- And Adolph Rupp looks disgusted.

1394
01:33:57,454 --> 01:34:01,823
Now Kentucky on offense for the first time.
The ball in the hands of Louie Dampier.

1395
01:34:01,892 --> 01:34:04,588
Texas Western in a man-to-man.
He gets it to Conley.

1396
01:34:04,661 --> 01:34:08,427
He's got a mismatch on Worsley. Backs
him down and scores. We're tied at two.

1397
01:34:08,499 --> 01:34:12,367
Conley, that's gonna be there
all night long.

1398
01:34:12,436 --> 01:34:16,930
The Miners work the ball into David Lattin.
He spins outta the double team. Scores.

1399
01:34:17,007 --> 01:34:18,235
There it is. There it is.

1400
01:34:18,308 --> 01:34:22,677
(commentator #2) It's six-seven. 240
pounds of a powerhouse in the middle.

1401
01:34:22,746 --> 01:34:25,544
Wildcats get the ball to the high post.
Thad Jaracz has it.

1402
01:34:25,616 --> 01:34:28,380
- Slow it down. Set it up.
- Lattin, get physical.

1403
01:34:28,452 --> 01:34:31,216
They cut off him.
He puts it on the floor. Goes to the hoop.

1404
01:34:31,288 --> 01:34:33,916
And he is fouled
and fouled hard by David Lattin.

1405
01:34:33,991 --> 01:34:37,256
That's a flagrant foul!
You gonna call that, ref?

1406
01:34:37,327 --> 01:34:41,627
That's a flagrant foul! You want there to be
a melee? Someone's gonna get hurt here.

1407
01:34:41,698 --> 01:34:43,256
I'll call the foul. Two shots.

1408
01:34:43,333 --> 01:34:45,358
A pair of free throws ties the game
at 12.

1409
01:34:45,436 --> 01:34:48,166
But the Baron is not happy
on the Kentucky bench.

1410
01:34:48,238 --> 01:34:51,469
Texas Western very disciplined
against this Kentucky zone.

1411
01:34:51,542 --> 01:34:54,636
They work the ball down low to Lattin.
He goes up for the shot.

1412
01:34:54,711 --> 01:34:59,171
No good. Offensive rebound.
Flournoy. And he is down and hurt.

1413
01:34:59,249 --> 01:35:00,944
(official) Stay down.
Coach.

1414
01:35:01,018 --> 01:35:02,451
Ohh!

1415
01:35:05,722 --> 01:35:07,952
Where'd he hurt? Harry.

1416
01:35:08,025 --> 01:35:11,017
How'd you come down?
Did it go out or in? Hold still.

1417
01:35:11,095 --> 01:35:13,996
Well, that's one less thing
to worry about.

1418
01:35:17,101 --> 01:35:19,092
Cager, you're in.

1419
01:35:22,339 --> 01:35:25,365
And it looks like Flournoy has
to come out of this game.

1420
01:35:25,442 --> 01:35:28,468
This will be a huge blow
to the Miners if he can't return.

1421
01:35:28,545 --> 01:35:30,012
He's through for the night.

1422
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:34,141
Oh. Boy. This will be tough because he's
a great rebounder for Texas Western.

1423
01:35:34,218 --> 01:35:39,815
At six-five. He is one of the best.
And it'll be a disaster if he can't continue.

1424
01:35:39,890 --> 01:35:42,222
Tough break, son.

1425
01:35:46,396 --> 01:35:49,229
Ten minutes gone
in this fast-paced first half.

1426
01:35:49,299 --> 01:35:52,996
Kentucky with the ball and the lead.
Here's a backdoor cut by Riley.

1427
01:35:53,070 --> 01:35:55,061
He goes up and is slammed to the floor.

1428
01:35:55,139 --> 01:35:57,937
And that'll be number three
on Big David Lattin.

1429
01:35:58,008 --> 01:36:02,342
That really hurts the Miners because this
big guy's been carrying Texas Western

1430
01:36:02,412 --> 01:36:04,209
with his strong inside play.

1431
01:36:04,281 --> 01:36:08,149
Now Don Haskins will have to take
the very physical Lattin out of the game.

1432
01:36:08,218 --> 01:36:09,742
I can't let you foul out.

1433
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:14,484
And it looks like Nevil Shed is replacing
him. But they're giving up something here.

1434
01:36:14,558 --> 01:36:20,019
Riley's first free throw is good. And Coach
Haskins wants a word with Bobby Joe Hill.

1435
01:36:20,797 --> 01:36:24,494
The Wildcats by four now with a chance
to stretch their lead.

1436
01:36:24,568 --> 01:36:27,560
Here's Tommy Kron
bringing the ball up for Kentucky.

1437
01:36:27,638 --> 01:36:30,300
Orsten Artis all over him.
And here comes Hill!

1438
01:36:30,374 --> 01:36:33,901
He strips it away
and he's going in for the lay-up!

1439
01:36:33,977 --> 01:36:36,502
(commentator #2) What a pair of hands.

1440
01:36:37,414 --> 01:36:39,405
(commentator) What a steal by Hill.

1441
01:36:39,483 --> 01:36:41,075
That happens when you don't talk
to each other.

1442
01:36:41,151 --> 01:36:45,485
This time Louie Dampier with the
basketball. He's played by Bobby Joe Hill.

1443
01:36:45,556 --> 01:36:48,047
He steps in and steals it again!
Holy mackerel!

1444
01:36:48,125 --> 01:36:52,061
Bobby Joe Hill picked the lock
on the Fort Knox hands of Louie Dampier.

1445
01:36:52,129 --> 01:36:56,566
And he's got back-to-back steals and
lay-ups. And like that. We're tied again.

1446
01:36:56,633 --> 01:36:58,328
Time-out. Time-out!

1447
01:36:58,402 --> 01:37:02,133
- (commentator #2) Kentucky wants time.
- (blows whistle) Time-out. White.

1448
01:37:02,206 --> 01:37:03,138
Yes.

1449
01:37:07,044 --> 01:37:09,945
Hey, those are two big-time plays, Hill.

1450
01:37:10,013 --> 01:37:12,447
- Are you scared?
- No, sir!

1451
01:37:12,516 --> 01:37:15,246
I know someone who's not scared.
Conley's not.

1452
01:37:15,319 --> 01:37:17,446
We don't teach scared
at the University of Kentucky.

1453
01:37:17,521 --> 01:37:20,888
I need you standing there waiting for 'em
when they come outta time-out,

1454
01:37:20,958 --> 01:37:22,653
like a force, like a wall!

1455
01:37:22,726 --> 01:37:26,287
Don't let that guy crowd you!
Get him out of there.

1456
01:37:26,363 --> 01:37:30,060
This the national championship.
Are you surprised? They come to play.

1457
01:37:30,133 --> 01:37:34,126
So we got to play back. We know how
to play this game better than anybody.

1458
01:37:34,204 --> 01:37:35,967
Play the game. Let's go.

1459
01:37:36,039 --> 01:37:37,836
Over here!

1460
01:37:40,844 --> 01:37:42,641
Yeah!

1461
01:37:44,648 --> 01:37:46,138
Set it up, set it up.

1462
01:37:46,216 --> 01:37:49,743
(Wildcat player) Defense, defense!
Watch Hill. Inside!

1463
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:51,185
Whoa! Whoa!

1464
01:37:55,058 --> 01:37:57,356
That's it. That's what I want.

1465
01:38:03,166 --> 01:38:05,191
(cheering)

1466
01:38:07,237 --> 01:38:08,226
Whoo!

1467
01:38:10,507 --> 01:38:12,873
Inside of ten seconds to go. First half.

1468
01:38:12,943 --> 01:38:17,039
Jaracz with the ball. High post.
Looking for Riley. Running off a screen.

1469
01:38:17,114 --> 01:38:19,344
Here's a shot at the buzzer.

1470
01:38:19,416 --> 01:38:21,111
It's good!

1471
01:38:25,589 --> 01:38:28,353
(commentator) We're all a little shocked.

1472
01:38:28,425 --> 01:38:31,223
Texas Western is leading Kentucky
at the half.

1473
01:38:31,295 --> 01:38:34,093
(commentator #2) But the smart money
has to be on Kentucky

1474
01:38:34,164 --> 01:38:37,327
'cause they were firing on all cylinders
to end the half.

1475
01:38:37,401 --> 01:38:39,164
The Miners did have some big plays.

1476
01:38:39,236 --> 01:38:42,228
But must be concerned with the three fouls
on David Lattin

1477
01:38:42,306 --> 01:38:44,433
as well as the injury to Harry Flournoy.

1478
01:38:44,508 --> 01:38:46,066
He will not return.

1479
01:38:52,215 --> 01:38:55,048
- Yo, hurry up, you late.
- Close the door. Come on.

1480
01:38:55,118 --> 01:38:57,586
They're getting ready
to start the second half.

1481
01:38:57,654 --> 01:38:58,916
... crowning a champion.

1482
01:38:58,989 --> 01:39:01,981
Don't let that cocky kid set a tent up
under the basket.

1483
01:39:02,059 --> 01:39:06,086
If he gets position on you, it'll throw down
every time. Get him out of there!

1484
01:39:06,163 --> 01:39:11,191
I'm putting you in with three fouls, Lattin.
You gotta play smart and protect the paint.

1485
01:39:11,268 --> 01:39:15,102
He's trying to figure out how to get you
to foul out, so keep your feet on the ground.

1486
01:39:15,172 --> 01:39:18,266
- Get a body on him. I want him outta there.
- OK? You ready?

1487
01:39:18,342 --> 01:39:20,708
- Are you the University of Kentucky?
- Yes, sir.

1488
01:39:20,777 --> 01:39:22,836
What has the Baron designed
for his Wildcats?

1489
01:39:22,913 --> 01:39:26,508
- Come on, number ten.
- Wildcats give the ball to Louie Dampier.

1490
01:39:26,583 --> 01:39:27,607
Get your hand up!

1491
01:39:27,684 --> 01:39:30,175
- Here's his long jump shot.
- There it is.

1492
01:39:30,253 --> 01:39:32,448
And the Kentucky fans are on their feet.

1493
01:39:32,522 --> 01:39:33,955
Come on, get back!

1494
01:39:34,024 --> 01:39:37,516
The Miners feed it inside to Lattin.
And Riley steals it away.

1495
01:39:37,594 --> 01:39:40,461
Now Kentucky looks to break.
Tommy Kron on the point.

1496
01:39:40,530 --> 01:39:43,761
Feeds it to Riley. Who beats Lattin
to the basket and lays it in for two!

1497
01:39:43,834 --> 01:39:45,927
Now. That is Kentucky basketball.

1498
01:39:46,002 --> 01:39:47,492
That's it, that's it.

1499
01:39:47,571 --> 01:39:51,632
Kentucky trapping outta their zone.
And Kron takes it away from Worsley.

1500
01:39:51,708 --> 01:39:55,371
The Wildcats look to run again.
Fast break ahead to Riley.

1501
01:39:55,445 --> 01:39:58,243
And that is back-to-back hoops
for the all-American.

1502
01:39:58,315 --> 01:40:02,376
I don't know what Coach Rupp told his
team at halftime. But they are on fire.

1503
01:40:02,452 --> 01:40:05,046
This is how the number-one team
in the nation plays.

1504
01:40:05,122 --> 01:40:08,558
Here's Riley on the move to the basket.
And Lattin fouls him again.

1505
01:40:08,625 --> 01:40:11,219
(referee) Foul. Miners, number 43!

1506
01:40:11,294 --> 01:40:14,991
And that will send the big center
to the bench with his fourth foul.

1507
01:40:15,065 --> 01:40:16,464
That's aggressive play.

1508
01:40:16,533 --> 01:40:20,162
The Miners are hanging in.
But that's gotta hurt on both ends.

1509
01:40:20,237 --> 01:40:23,001
Hey, there's a lot of ball on that, ref.

1510
01:40:27,411 --> 01:40:31,370
I know Lattin's out. But you can't do this
all by yourself. Just slow it down.

1511
01:40:31,448 --> 01:40:33,006
OK? Get everybody involved.

1512
01:40:35,318 --> 01:40:38,651
And Kentucky leads by eight
with ten minutes to play.

1513
01:40:38,722 --> 01:40:40,713
Ball! Ball, ball!

1514
01:40:41,992 --> 01:40:45,189
Bobby Joe Hill will fire one up
from 25 feet.

1515
01:40:45,262 --> 01:40:46,286
And he got it!

1516
01:40:46,363 --> 01:40:47,523
Check him! Check him!

1517
01:40:47,597 --> 01:40:48,757
Whoo!

1518
01:40:48,832 --> 01:40:51,164
Defense, now, defense!

1519
01:40:57,007 --> 01:40:59,475
Way to penetrate. That's what I want.

1520
01:41:02,012 --> 01:41:03,502
Ah, ha-ha!

1521
01:41:08,919 --> 01:41:10,011
Yes!

1522
01:41:22,766 --> 01:41:25,860
Cager's spun it off the glass.
And the Miners lead by three!

1523
01:41:25,936 --> 01:41:29,702
Time. Time! Time-out, Wildcats!

1524
01:41:30,574 --> 01:41:32,132
Coach Rupp calls time.
He's seen enough.

1525
01:41:33,310 --> 01:41:37,406
Miners lead at 64-61.
Just two minutes left.

1526
01:41:44,688 --> 01:41:49,352
All season, when you had nothing left,
you come up with it. And you had success.

1527
01:41:49,426 --> 01:41:51,291
You did it, you did it.

1528
01:41:51,361 --> 01:41:54,819
And that's how we got here, from your
efforts. From your efforts, we're here.

1529
01:41:54,898 --> 01:41:59,164
We are two minutes from a championship.
Lattin, I'm putting you back in.

1530
01:41:59,236 --> 01:42:02,069
Right now it's not about talent -
it's about heart.

1531
01:42:02,138 --> 01:42:05,539
It's about who can go out there
and play the hardest and the smartest.

1532
01:42:05,609 --> 01:42:07,668
This team's a special team.

1533
01:42:08,945 --> 01:42:11,175
Special team.

1534
01:42:12,516 --> 01:42:14,279
You're gonna win this game.

1535
01:42:14,351 --> 01:42:15,909
- You hear that?
- Yes, sir.

1536
01:42:15,986 --> 01:42:20,389
You're gonna win this game.
So go out there and make me a prophet.

1537
01:42:20,457 --> 01:42:22,948
They've been here before -
they won't give it to us.

1538
01:42:23,026 --> 01:42:27,053
We gotta go out there and we gotta take it!
Right? Take it! Take it!

1539
01:42:27,130 --> 01:42:30,031
I want you to go out there and take it!
One, two, three!

1540
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:31,533
Take it!

1541
01:42:37,641 --> 01:42:42,044
Two minutes to go. And the Miners lead
Adolph Rupp and Kentucky by three.

1542
01:42:42,112 --> 01:42:44,046
Defense! Defense!

1543
01:42:44,114 --> 01:42:45,103
Four-two.

1544
01:42:45,181 --> 01:42:48,309
Louie Dampier guarded tightly
by Bobby Joe Hill.

1545
01:42:48,385 --> 01:42:50,979
He reverses his dribble and fires.
It's good!

1546
01:42:51,054 --> 01:42:52,043
There it is.

1547
01:42:52,122 --> 01:42:54,590
That was a big shot.

1548
01:42:54,658 --> 01:42:56,649
Miners look to answer.

1549
01:42:59,396 --> 01:43:00,954
Yes!

1550
01:43:01,031 --> 01:43:03,591
Wildcats into the front court.
Needing a score.

1551
01:43:03,667 --> 01:43:05,862
Riley breaks free.

1552
01:43:11,708 --> 01:43:13,608
Set it up! Set it up!

1553
01:43:13,677 --> 01:43:16,009
Now who will answer the bell
for the Miners?

1554
01:43:16,079 --> 01:43:18,240
Artis passes it to Cager
at the foul line.

1555
01:43:18,315 --> 01:43:22,479
He slashes around Jaracz.
Takes it right down Main Street.

1556
01:43:26,423 --> 01:43:30,052
So it comes down to this.
18 seconds remain.

1557
01:43:30,126 --> 01:43:32,424
Wildcats with the ball.
In need of a score

1558
01:43:32,495 --> 01:43:35,931
to keep their hopes
of a fifth national championship alive.

1559
01:43:35,999 --> 01:43:40,436
Kentucky looking inside for a mismatch
against the shorter Worsley.

1560
01:43:41,972 --> 01:43:43,997
Stolen away by Bobby Joe.

1561
01:44:04,961 --> 01:44:08,192
Desperation time now for Kentucky
in the final seconds.

1562
01:44:08,264 --> 01:44:11,859
Here's a miss by Kron.
Lattin has the rebound for Texas Western.

1563
01:44:11,935 --> 01:44:16,167
He gives it to Bobby Joe. Looking
at the clock. Watching it count down.

1564
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:19,037
Ten. Nine. Eight...

1565
01:44:19,109 --> 01:44:22,545
The Miners are on their way to victory.

1566
01:44:23,913 --> 01:44:26,245
(buzzer signals the end of the game)

1567
01:44:29,853 --> 01:44:32,378
Whoo! Whoo!

1568
01:44:32,455 --> 01:44:33,683
(gibberish)

1569
01:44:41,164 --> 01:44:45,100
This is the greatest upset
in NCAA history!

1570
01:44:45,168 --> 01:44:49,502
Texas Western is
the new national champion!

1571
01:45:06,189 --> 01:45:07,213
Whoo!

1572
01:45:07,290 --> 01:45:10,088
National champion!

1573
01:45:21,371 --> 01:45:24,431
Mama, I'm a national champion.

1574
01:45:25,241 --> 01:45:28,039
I'm a national champion.

1575
01:45:28,111 --> 01:45:29,703
Whoo!

1576
01:45:37,153 --> 01:45:39,815
Where is he?
I can't see! Where is he?

1577
01:45:39,889 --> 01:45:42,119
(squeals)

1578
01:45:44,327 --> 01:45:46,591
I love you, Mama. Thank you.

# They're gonna say love

1632
01:50:38,888 --> 01:50:44,690
You know, Kentucky's so big,
and Adolph Rupp's name was so big,

1633
01:50:44,761 --> 01:50:49,721
that, I guess,
that made it more significant.

1634
01:50:49,799 --> 01:50:53,394
The initial thought was,
"Do we really have a chance here?"

1635
01:50:53,469 --> 01:50:56,233
We felt their presence
at the beginning of the game,

1636
01:50:56,305 --> 01:50:59,866
when they came out
with this incredible effort and zeal.

1637
01:50:59,942 --> 01:51:05,312
I think the most significant...
It's when David Lattin made his dunk shot -

1638
01:51:05,381 --> 01:51:07,212
that's what really got us going.

1639
01:51:07,283 --> 01:51:11,481
And I went up, and he grabbed it,
and he just kept going up and up and up.

1640
01:51:11,554 --> 01:51:13,545
And he just dunked it
over the top of me.

1641
01:51:13,623 --> 01:51:17,559
He put it down with such ferocity
that it intimidated me.

1642
01:51:17,627 --> 01:51:22,462
And I did tell David before the game,
if he hadn't run over somebody,

1643
01:51:22,532 --> 01:51:25,933
that I wanted him to tear the rim off
a couple of times.

1644
01:51:26,002 --> 01:51:32,168
But those two steals by Bobby Joe Hill
broke our back

1645
01:51:32,241 --> 01:51:36,439
and reinforced what the reality was.

1646
01:51:36,512 --> 01:51:39,879
And the reality was this:

1647
01:51:39,949 --> 01:51:42,110
They were bigger and they were better

1648
01:51:42,185 --> 01:51:46,121
and they were more talented and they were
quicker. They were a better team.

1649
01:51:46,189 --> 01:51:49,750
Kentucky was kind of a tough team
to match up against.

1650
01:51:49,826 --> 01:51:52,659
See, that was a very, very quick team.

1651
01:51:52,728 --> 01:51:57,927
And I played the guys
that I felt we could win with.

1652
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,731
We ran out there.
And what I saw was wall-to-wall people.

1653
01:52:03,139 --> 01:52:06,870
The reporter was white.
The cheerleaders was white.

1654
01:52:06,943 --> 01:52:09,707
The referee was white.
The camera people was white.

1655
01:52:09,779 --> 01:52:15,240
It was an atmosphere that could have been
real hostile for us if we allowed it to be.

1656
01:52:15,318 --> 01:52:21,814
I feel that this game was probably
the Emancipation Proclamation of 1966.

1657
01:52:21,891 --> 01:52:27,386
And it wasn't until history started to talk
about this game, you know, in that context,

1658
01:52:27,463 --> 01:52:30,455
that we realized we were part
of something that was bigger

1659
01:52:30,533 --> 01:52:32,694
than just five blacks and five whites.

1660
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:37,102
Black ballplayers were thought of
as inferior.

1661
01:52:37,173 --> 01:52:42,941
You know, can't work under pressure. You
know, rip 'em a little bit, and they'll fold.

1662
01:52:43,012 --> 01:52:47,540
That was the way that a white person
was thinking back then,

1663
01:52:47,617 --> 01:52:51,075
that we couldn't compete
with the white players.

1664
01:52:51,154 --> 01:52:54,317
We experienced a lot of racism
during that season.

1665
01:52:54,390 --> 01:53:01,728
People would spit at you,
and fans would call us niggers, coons...

1666
01:53:02,965 --> 01:53:08,096
And the world looked at it
in that perspective -

1667
01:53:08,171 --> 01:53:12,437
the white team verses this black team.
For us.

1668
01:53:12,508 --> 01:53:15,534
We were playing for much more
than what they were playing for.

1669
01:53:15,611 --> 01:53:18,546
They were playing
for just another championship.

1670
01:53:18,614 --> 01:53:22,948
We were playing to prove that it doesn't
make any difference what color you were -

1671
01:53:23,019 --> 01:53:27,718
if you're given the opportunity,
you could do anything.

1672
01:53:27,790 --> 01:53:31,749
If I could turn back the hands of time,

1673
01:53:31,827 --> 01:53:38,596
I would have love to have gone over
to the Kentucky players

1674
01:53:38,668 --> 01:53:40,795
and shaken their hands.

1675
01:53:40,870 --> 01:53:43,805
Not to patronize them, you know?

1676
01:53:43,873 --> 01:53:47,809
And not to say,
"Thank you for giving me an opportunity."

1677
01:53:47,877 --> 01:53:51,369
You didn't give us this opportunity.
We earned this, see.

1678
01:53:51,447 --> 01:53:56,475
I'm proud to be part of this portrayal
of a great, great man in Don Haskins

1679
01:53:56,552 --> 01:54:01,080
and, you know, players
who simply cared about being great

1680
01:54:01,157 --> 01:54:04,422
and wanting to separate themselves
from the pack

1681
01:54:04,493 --> 01:54:09,089
and wanting to do something unique.

1682
01:54:09,165 --> 01:54:13,261
And to leave footprints in the sand.
They've done that, man.

1683
01:54:13,336 --> 01:54:15,463
They've done that.

1684
01:55:29,812 --> 01:55:33,213
