The events in this film
are based on historical facts.

8
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,222
Following the tragic demise
of my father, Duke Eberhard Ludwig,

9
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:49,391
the rule of this blessed land
has passed into my hands.

10
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:55,298
At this time, I wish to commit myself
to my people by oath.

11
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:57,409
I ask the Council
to read out the oath.

12
00:01:57,544 --> 00:02:02,447
As a sign of my vow, I place my hand
upon the constitution of this land.

13
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:06,416
"We, Prince Karl Alexander,
Duke of Württemberg,

14
00:02:06,553 --> 00:02:10,284
Imperial Field Marshall
and former Governor of Serbia,

15
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:12,653
swear by God Almighty

16
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:18,924
to care for our subjects „well-being
with the utmost devotion.

17
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:22,932
We promise, by this solemn oath,

18
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,062
to ensure that our rule shall,
in all manner and true form,

19
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:31,143
adhere to the honesty and faith
that are Württemberg custom.

20
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:36,571
We solemnly vow
to uphold the constitution,

21
00:02:36,716 --> 00:02:40,243
and, true to the constitution,
together with the Council,

22
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:44,083
to maintain the leadership
of the Dukedom."

23
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:46,385
I swear it!

24
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:36,440
All of my thoughts

25
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:41,013
They are with you

26
00:03:41,147 --> 00:03:46,107
You, my one and only

27
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:50,621
Never leave me

28
00:03:50,757 --> 00:04:00,291
For you, you, you
To be thinking of me

29
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:03,958
That would be my greatest wish

30
00:04:04,137 --> 00:04:06,401
Darling

31
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:16,073
I wish to never leave you

32
00:04:17,116 --> 00:04:18,879
Thank you.

33
00:04:22,622 --> 00:04:23,089
Dorle!

34
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:24,681
Dorle!

35
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:26,158
Father!

36
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:29,557
Come on, Dorothea,
to the dinner table! Quick!

37
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:31,823
I have to be in the castle
in an hour.

38
00:04:31,998 --> 00:04:35,229
Anew notebook?

39
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:40,367
"All of my thoughts..."

40
00:04:40,506 --> 00:04:42,440
That’s lovely!

41
00:04:42,775 --> 00:04:44,538
"To my dear bride Dorothea Sturm

42
00:04:44,677 --> 00:04:47,908
on the day of our beloved
Duke Karl Alexander’s coronation

43
00:04:48,047 --> 00:04:50,948
from her loving and loyal Faber."

44
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:58,422
The goose will be burnt.
We’ve waited for you for too long.

45
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:00,287
Don’t complain, Dorothea.

46
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:02,860
It was a stirring ceremony.

47
00:05:02,995 --> 00:05:06,692
Our little household
can wait a bit on this occasion.

48
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:12,263
Give your bridegroom a leg.

49
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:14,771
Give me a leg.

50
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,370
Lovely crisp skin!

51
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:21,275
This is my favorite Sunday dinner.

52
00:05:23,082 --> 00:05:24,572
So, to whom do we drink?

53
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:27,413
To Faber? May I?

54
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:33,890
Faber? Faber is not so important.
None of us are that important.

55
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:38,326
So, to whom do we drink today?

56
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:41,058
Dorothea, today...?

57
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:43,958
To our Duke.

58
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:48,972
Karl Alexander.
May God guide him safely.

59
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:08,721
My Duchess!

60
00:06:10,797 --> 00:06:12,526
You get your present later.

61
00:06:12,698 --> 00:06:16,065
Come, your people are calling for you.

62
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,420
My people! My land!

63
00:06:36,556 --> 00:06:41,823
Württemberg, the most blessed land
among the Germans.

64
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:50,069
COINS AND JEWELRY

65
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:51,764
COINS AND JEWELRY

66
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:58,075
Go. I don’t want you to be seen
in the Jewish Quarter.

67
00:06:58,211 --> 00:06:58,973
Yes.

68
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,040
I’m looking for Mister Oppenheimer.

69
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,648
He’s expecting Your Excellency.

70
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:21,364
What’s that goyish-looking prig
doing at Oppenheimer's?

71
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:23,059
What a question!

72
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:26,296
You mean he needs money?

73
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:28,930
No.

74
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:33,102
But he won’t give him any.

75
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:37,478
Yes, he will, and plenty.

76
00:07:37,617 --> 00:07:43,055
He should give it to him,
so we can take, take, take.

77
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:47,419
Put something on, Rebecca.

78
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:50,819
I think Württemberg is rich.

79
00:07:50,997 --> 00:07:54,626
Württemberg is, but not its Duke.

80
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,233
Well, I’ll see.

81
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:08,412
Fabulous!

82
00:08:15,254 --> 00:08:20,351
Fabulous, really fabulous!

83
00:08:20,493 --> 00:08:22,222
But too much for us.

84
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:24,727
Too much for a duchess?

85
00:08:30,202 --> 00:08:34,798
Fabulous! Wonderful!

86
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:37,239
I don’t even dare ask
how much it costs.

87
00:08:37,376 --> 00:08:38,240
50,000 talers.

88
00:08:38,377 --> 00:08:40,937
As I said, my Duke doesn’t have
that much money.

89
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,638
Fine. Ten?

90
00:08:42,782 --> 00:08:45,410
What about the remaining 40,000?

91
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:47,749
We’ll make a deal.

92
00:08:47,887 --> 00:08:50,151
What about the 40,000?

93
00:08:50,423 --> 00:08:52,186
We’ll settle it somehow.

94
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:54,054
When? Where?

95
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:56,826
In Stuttgart.

96
00:08:56,996 --> 00:09:00,955
You know well enough
that no Jews may enter Stuttgart.

97
00:09:02,468 --> 00:09:06,666
Tell your Duke that if he needs me,

98
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:10,765
he should arrange a permit
for me to come to him.

99
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,935
When you come to Stuttgart,
perhaps I could help you,

100
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:15,445
but you cannot enter the city gates
with your papers.

101
00:09:15,581 --> 00:09:17,811
Then lift the ban on Jews.

102
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:19,449
Me?

103
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:21,018
Not even the Duke may do that.

104
00:09:21,153 --> 00:09:23,519
He could, but only
with the Council’s agreement,

105
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:26,090
and they won’t let in any Jews.

106
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:30,662
If His Highness
wants to do business with me,

107
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:37,065
Your Excellency will find ways
and means to arrange my papers

108
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:39,933
so that I shall have
no difficulties at the border.

109
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:46,975
Say, I send you such a passport.
Anyone could tell you’re a Jew.

110
00:09:47,113 --> 00:09:50,173
By the side curls and clothes,
you mean?

111
00:09:51,183 --> 00:09:55,847
Don’t worry, I’d fix my appearance.

112
00:09:56,355 --> 00:10:00,689
Send the papers,
and the Duke gets his jewels.

113
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:04,387
But only if I deliver them
to him in person.

114
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,053
All right.

115
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:09,690
But it’s urgent.
The Duke needs the jewels.

116
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:14,738
Rely on Süss Oppenheimer,
Your Excellency. Good-bye.

117
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:23,172
Are you mad, Joseph?

118
00:10:23,315 --> 00:10:27,809
You want to cut your beard and side
curls and change your clothing.

119
00:10:27,953 --> 00:10:31,081
Have you no fear of our Rabbi?

120
00:10:31,223 --> 00:10:37,128
I shall open the door for all of you!

121
00:10:37,296 --> 00:10:43,599
You’ll wear velvet and silks,
tomorrow or the day after.

122
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:47,297
That day will surely come.

123
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:26,842
That’s what I was afraid of
the whole time!

124
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,708
What a road!

125
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,715
Hell!

126
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:35,787
Don’t swear.
I must get to Stuttgart tonight.

127
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:39,220
If we had only gone a bit slower,
you would be there!

128
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:46,821
Is anyone hurt?

129
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:50,162
Thank goodness, no.

130
00:11:50,302 --> 00:11:52,236
But you did take a spill.

131
00:11:52,404 --> 00:11:55,965
The road is in bad condition.

132
00:11:56,108 --> 00:11:58,906
How long does it take to get
to Stuttgart from here?

133
00:11:59,044 --> 00:12:00,033
An hour.

134
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:01,476
An hour?

135
00:12:01,614 --> 00:12:06,619
Would it be terribly impolite
to ask you to take me part of the way?

136
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:11,618
Why does the Duke need a ballet,
an opera house?

137
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:16,854
And for God’s sake, what is the need
for a bodyguard? He’s safe here.

138
00:12:16,996 --> 00:12:22,263
Gentlemen, I agree with you
that our Duke’s demands

139
00:12:22,401 --> 00:12:25,427
from our State Council
are exorbitant.

140
00:12:25,671 --> 00:12:29,801
I am also of the opinion
that we are used to simple living,

141
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:34,072
and that our constituents
would not understand us

142
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:37,273
if we consent to our Duke’s demands.

143
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:41,352
But, gentlemen,
nor do we want to be petty.

144
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:46,857
The Duke was a great general
and needs soldiers around him.

145
00:12:46,992 --> 00:12:49,756
Let him have his bodyguard.

146
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:53,991
All right, let him keep his guards.
But no opera or ballet.

147
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,930
I’d like to emphasize
that we’re bowing to him,

148
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,400
contrary to our convictions.

149
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:02,803
As we saw yesterday, he presented
new and even higher demands.

150
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:07,106
We only make it harder
on ourselves if we consent.

151
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:11,512
Even the guard should be refused him.

152
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:13,913
You don’t have a sense of humor.

153
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:21,186
All right, Faber. Count the votes.
You know my stand.

154
00:13:22,127 --> 00:13:24,186
Mister Oppenheimer? Of Frankfurt?

155
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:27,127
- Mister Oppenheimer?
- Oppenheimer.

156
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:29,062
Your papers are in order.

157
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:44,006
If I could, I’d like to travel
all over the world.

158
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:46,140
You have surely traveled.

159
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:50,187
Have you been to Paris? Versailles?

160
00:13:50,322 --> 00:13:53,689
I envy you. Where else?

161
00:13:53,826 --> 00:13:59,128
London, Vienna, Rome,
Madrid, Lisbon.

162
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:02,165
My goodness!
That’s almost the whole world.

163
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:03,791
Which one was the nicest place?

164
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:08,804
I mean, where did you feel
most at home?

165
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:10,771
At home?

166
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,808
Everywhere.

167
00:14:11,944 --> 00:14:14,208
Everywhere?
Have you no homeland?

168
00:14:14,346 --> 00:14:16,143
I do. The world.

169
00:14:16,282 --> 00:14:19,649
Nonsense. You must have felt
happiest somewhere.

170
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:25,781
As happy as I am here now
in Stuttgart, sitting next to you,

171
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:29,156
as happy as now,
I have never felt in my entire life.

172
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,389
Rejected?

173
00:14:33,565 --> 00:14:35,760
Yes, Your Highness.
Seven votes to four.

174
00:14:35,935 --> 00:14:37,835
I get no opera?

175
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,961
No, Highness.
Nor any ballet.

176
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:43,836
What? No ballet?
And no guard either?

177
00:14:43,976 --> 00:14:45,273
No, Your Highness.

178
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:50,644
I think I was treated better
even in Belgrade, as governor.

179
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:51,943
Oh, the Councilmen!

180
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:54,552
The Councilmen think

181
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:57,656
that Your Highness" ancestors
didn’t need a bodyguard, either.

182
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,818
- In the Constitution...
- The Constitution is none of...

183
00:15:02,962 --> 00:15:08,559
Perhaps another discussion
with the Councilmen is called for.

184
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:13,694
The Councilmen! I’d rather be bound
to a golden jackass.

185
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:17,740
That’s a Jew, that
Mister Oppenheimer of Frankfurt.

186
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,210
If I can ever be of service to you,

187
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:24,612
I’d be delighted to reciprocate
the kindness of your gentle daughter.

188
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:29,084
They let him through the city gates
without question.

189
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:32,987
I was right. He is a Jew!

190
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:37,725
Sir, I would advise you
not to miss the next coach.

191
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,023
Why? I am in no hurry.
I have business in Stuttgart.

192
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,566
On the contrary,
could you recommend a good inn?

193
00:15:43,702 --> 00:15:47,103
There are no inns for Jews
within Stuttgart’s city limits.

194
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,105
I compliment your awareness.

195
00:15:56,382 --> 00:15:58,441
But I am so obliged to the damsel,

196
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:05,649
she would understand
if I don’t comment.

197
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:10,852
Ask him already how much
the necklace costs.

198
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,989
Your Highness shouldn’t trouble
himself about business matters.

199
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:18,568
I am delighted to be of service
to Your Highness.

200
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:22,605
- Yes, but everything has a price.
- The Jew is waiting.

201
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:29,203
So? Yes, should a Jew be more
generous than my Councilmen?

202
00:16:29,348 --> 00:16:34,479
They apparently don’t know
how to treat a great personality.

203
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,917
And you do?

204
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:37,784
I think I do.

205
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:45,056
For example, I don’t understand
why the Council denies you a ballet.

206
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,528
I just cannot grasp it.

207
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:51,032
With Your Highness" permission,

208
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:56,369
I’d consider myself fortunate
were an arrangement reached

209
00:16:56,508 --> 00:17:02,037
whereby Your Highness
would actually... The ballet, I mean,

210
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:05,014
I’d consider myself fortunate
to be allowed to say

211
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,983
that I am Your Highness"
loyal servant.

212
00:17:36,482 --> 00:17:40,441
Remchingen, interrupt the rehearsal

213
00:17:40,586 --> 00:17:43,817
and bring me the little
black-haired one.

214
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:55,259
Süss, I need some small trinket.

215
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:02,967
I have nothing else on me right now
but this little...

216
00:18:33,172 --> 00:18:38,109
- One day you’ll present your bill.
- Why the aggravation, sir?

217
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:40,074
Württemberg is such a blessed land,

218
00:18:40,212 --> 00:18:43,875
and you sound as if not one taler
could be squeezed of the state.

219
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:46,450
Asia’s riches would pale

220
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:49,611
when the authorities realize
what sources lie in Württemberg.

221
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:51,689
But, my God, they do not!

222
00:18:51,823 --> 00:18:53,723
Who does not what?

223
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,953
- I think...
- So what?

224
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:00,895
With your permission, Your Highness,
I can’t understand

225
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:06,369
how out of 400 villages and 70 cities
that no more money can be had.

226
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:08,735
Money? How?
For you or perhaps for me?

227
00:19:08,874 --> 00:19:10,705
Highness, do you want to know
what you owe the Jew?

228
00:19:10,842 --> 00:19:14,642
352,000 talers. Exactly.

229
00:19:18,383 --> 00:19:20,510
So what?

230
00:19:20,652 --> 00:19:22,620
Should I pay that?

231
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:25,052
Your Highness,
I did not demand a thing.

232
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,682
Your demands shall be fully met.
I don’t take gifts from Jews.

233
00:19:28,827 --> 00:19:34,265
Of course not.
I know civilized people pay debts.

234
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:36,867
You could seize what I have.

235
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:40,163
Seize? No!
Oh, Your Highness!

236
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:41,203
Pardon?

237
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,900
What does Your Highness possess?

238
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:46,442
How rude! I possess Württemberg.

239
00:19:46,578 --> 00:19:49,274
Not bad. Württemberg.

240
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:52,982
Do you want to have Württemberg,
and I should take it seriously?

241
00:19:53,118 --> 00:19:55,143
That was only a joke.

242
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:59,553
I ask of Your Highness,
only if you want to pay...

243
00:19:59,691 --> 00:20:03,058
Your Highness could also hang me.
I am only a Jew.

244
00:20:03,195 --> 00:20:05,254
What? What should I give you?

245
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,489
Give me the roads of Württemberg.

246
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,601
The roads of Württemberg?
What for?

247
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:14,136
Lease me the roads of Württemberg
for 10 years.

248
00:20:14,273 --> 00:20:17,606
Let me manage them.
They are in terrible condition.

249
00:20:17,743 --> 00:20:19,938
It’s high time they be repaired.

250
00:20:20,078 --> 00:20:23,206
I'll keep the road and bridge taxes

251
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:27,307
and give Your Highness
the tolls collected at the town gates

252
00:20:27,452 --> 00:20:28,612
through which the roads go.

253
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:29,413
Slow down.

254
00:20:29,554 --> 00:20:33,183
In this way, Your Highness meets
his promises, I make money,

255
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:35,088
and no one gets hurt.

256
00:20:35,227 --> 00:20:37,127
The roads!

257
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:42,322
And what will my Swabians
say to that?

258
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:43,900
What should they say?

259
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:46,300
Should they transport
their grain free of charge

260
00:20:46,438 --> 00:20:49,999
on the roads and over the bridges?

261
00:20:50,142 --> 00:20:57,310
Every bridge and road has cost much
and should produce income.

262
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:01,819
If this were no Jew...

263
00:21:01,953 --> 00:21:07,585
Why? Does not the Kaiser Leopold
in Vienna have a money-making Jew?

264
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:13,130
Does he not have his Isaac
Oppenheimer? Is he not strong?

265
00:21:13,265 --> 00:21:14,926
Power is money.

266
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:15,901
This is crazy!
I've paid in four villages already!

267
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:19,166
This is crazy!
I’ve paid in four villages already!

268
00:21:19,338 --> 00:21:22,171
At two bridges,
that makes six talers tax.

269
00:21:22,307 --> 00:21:28,405
Now you want one more.
The whole load is worth only 20!

270
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:34,782
Here comes the tax collector.
Complain to him.

271
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:37,418
What happened?

272
00:21:37,556 --> 00:21:40,218
They’re all complaining.

273
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:41,826
What about?

274
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,622
If I have to pay seven more talers...!

275
00:21:44,796 --> 00:21:48,630
Don’t shout. You don’t know
how to make calculations.

276
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,530
How much do you take for your grain?

277
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:52,136
Fifteen per hundred.

278
00:21:52,304 --> 00:21:54,602
Fifteen per hundred?
Speak German! Fifteen percent.

279
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,302
Listen, till now you made a 15 percent
profit on 20 talers. How much?

280
00:21:59,978 --> 00:22:01,002
Three talers.

281
00:22:01,146 --> 00:22:05,082
Today you may make 15 percent
on 27 talers. That’s?

282
00:22:06,518 --> 00:22:11,114
4.25! That’s plus 1.25 for yourself.

283
00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:15,989
Right? For each taler the Duke takes,
you make a profit!

284
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:20,826
If tomorrow bread prices double,
you make double the profit.

285
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:24,059
So, go thank the Duke.

286
00:22:24,236 --> 00:22:25,703
- But...
- No buts!

287
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:27,896
Pay! Pay! Learn how to reckon!

288
00:22:28,373 --> 00:22:33,572
Father, meat prices have gone up,
vegetables, everything!

289
00:22:33,712 --> 00:22:37,648
I used to pay one coin.
Now I pay three.

290
00:22:37,783 --> 00:22:42,049
First the meat, now bread.
Oh, children, children!

291
00:22:42,187 --> 00:22:44,621
And eggs! it’s not the end.

292
00:22:44,756 --> 00:22:47,452
And the one to blame for all this,
you brought into town!

293
00:22:47,592 --> 00:22:49,219
Don’t speak so harshly to me.

294
00:22:51,296 --> 00:22:54,424
The Duke has exceeded his authority.

295
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:59,468
He’s collecting by force the guard
funds that we refused him.

296
00:23:03,074 --> 00:23:06,202
I like the Duke,
but there’s a limit to everything!

297
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:08,168
It won’t turn out well.

298
00:23:08,313 --> 00:23:10,543
That’s frightening,
what you’re saying!

299
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:13,480
Are you afraid of Jews, Dorothea?

300
00:23:13,618 --> 00:23:18,055
Yesterday I saw a Jew, Levy,
riding from gate to gate,

301
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,650
and from bridge to bridge,
and inspecting every post,

302
00:23:22,794 --> 00:23:25,786
collecting the Württemberg
farmers" money

303
00:23:25,964 --> 00:23:27,932
and sticking it in his filthy bag!

304
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:31,330
Calm down.

305
00:23:33,305 --> 00:23:36,502
This is pointless.

306
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:40,338
The Jew did, in fact,
buy the Duke his guard,

307
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:44,575
and that is stronger than you,
my child. We must be wise.

308
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,741
We’ll never be as wise as the Jews.

309
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:49,319
Much wiser!

310
00:23:49,454 --> 00:23:52,821
The Jews aren’t wise.
They’re just clever.

311
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:55,791
So, you don’t want to pay
the 80 talers?

312
00:23:55,927 --> 00:23:58,054
Get the wife and kid away from here.

313
00:23:58,196 --> 00:24:00,664
I don’t have 80 talers.

314
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:02,265
But the road is mine.

315
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,800
I bought it from the Duke,
paid for it.

316
00:24:04,936 --> 00:24:08,963
The house is not on the road.
The road circles the house.

317
00:24:09,107 --> 00:24:11,940
That’s right!
Excuse me, may I?

318
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:15,410
The road circles here,
but it goes in a circle,

319
00:24:15,547 --> 00:24:18,072
because people used to circle it.

320
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:20,116
Originally, it was straight.

321
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:24,689
Is there a stream or hill there
forcing the road to circle them?

322
00:24:24,823 --> 00:24:29,385
No! But your house is there.
That’s why the road is crooked.

323
00:24:29,528 --> 00:24:32,088
Why is your house in the road?

324
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:33,856
The smith shop always...

325
00:24:34,032 --> 00:24:37,968
By the road, not in it.

326
00:24:38,136 --> 00:24:40,331
All right, let it be in it,

327
00:24:40,472 --> 00:24:45,307
but then this bit of the road
must belong to you, as well.

328
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:49,903
If it doesn’t, you must buy it.

329
00:24:50,582 --> 00:24:52,607
All right, Levy, all right.

330
00:24:52,751 --> 00:24:55,345
But I won’t sell to the blacksmith.

331
00:24:55,487 --> 00:24:57,785
I just wanted to be nice to him.

332
00:24:57,923 --> 00:25:01,552
But the idea of possession
was misunderstood.

333
00:25:01,693 --> 00:25:03,217
Possession?

334
00:25:03,361 --> 00:25:08,458
Blacksmith, whatever stands
on your land is yours, no?

335
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,024
Of course.

336
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:13,271
And whatever stands on mine,
whose is it?

337
00:25:13,438 --> 00:25:20,002
- What is that supposed to mean?
- A part of your house is mine.

338
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:23,478
And I'll tear that part down
because I don’t want it there.

339
00:25:23,615 --> 00:25:26,277
I don’t want a house on my road.

340
00:25:26,418 --> 00:25:29,854
But half of the house is on the ground
that your secretary marked.

341
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:32,047
It’s our smith shop! It’s our living!

342
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:36,684
Your rebel should have thought
of that before, dear Madame.

343
00:26:01,586 --> 00:26:07,115
Half a house, cute as a toy!
It looks like a doll’s house!

344
00:26:07,258 --> 00:26:10,455
It will stand there like that
for a whole year,

345
00:26:10,595 --> 00:26:13,428
so people will start to think
whether they can afford

346
00:26:13,598 --> 00:26:17,500
to resist the Financial Advisor,
even if his name is Oppenheimer.

347
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:21,332
You’re so clever! But evil!

348
00:26:23,942 --> 00:26:25,432
Look at the Jew!

349
00:26:25,577 --> 00:26:28,569
Just look at this exploiter of people!

350
00:26:33,518 --> 00:26:35,213
Keep going!

351
00:26:35,353 --> 00:26:37,583
- There are people in the way!
- Drive over them!

352
00:26:43,662 --> 00:26:47,860
Arrest him! Arrest this man
immediately! He’s a murderer!

353
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:51,358
Get going!

354
00:26:51,536 --> 00:26:56,371
To simply order the officials
to send in their daughters...

355
00:26:56,508 --> 00:26:57,668
Isn’t it an honor?

356
00:26:57,809 --> 00:26:59,743
Honor? It’s a scandal!

357
00:26:59,811 --> 00:27:03,144
But I’m no longer a child.
I know how to behave properly.

358
00:27:03,281 --> 00:27:05,681
Shut up! Don’t give me
such answers, know-it-all!

359
00:27:05,817 --> 00:27:11,585
Don’t spoil their fun. They aren’t
always invited by the Duke.

360
00:27:11,723 --> 00:27:14,021
By the Duke?
It’s the Jew who invited them.

361
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,458
Once again, the Jew has organized
a meat-market,

362
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:20,496
and our daughters are good enough
to be the merchandise.

363
00:27:33,078 --> 00:27:35,478
Gentlemen to the left,
ladies forward!

364
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:58,094
Primitive natures would think this is
fun, but for me it’s too conservative.

365
00:27:58,269 --> 00:28:02,603
I didn’t send my wife away
to Ludwigsburg for this.

366
00:28:06,945 --> 00:28:08,640
Where is your fantasy, Jew?

367
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,112
Note the order, Your Highness.

368
00:28:11,249 --> 00:28:14,412
In the back are the old ladies,
in front, the juicy ones,

369
00:28:14,552 --> 00:28:17,851
and the tender things, opposite
your bodyguard, Your Highness.

370
00:28:23,228 --> 00:28:26,959
Patience, Your Highness.
Don’t spoil our surprise.

371
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:32,661
Close off this section, jackass!
We should make a room here.

372
00:28:36,141 --> 00:28:39,702
I thought that, instead of
the court thistles, just once

373
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:43,678
you’d enjoy the spring blossoms
on your own.

374
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:47,449
What this devil thinks up!

375
00:28:47,585 --> 00:28:49,712
Like a shepherd tending sheep,

376
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:52,084
I separate daughters
from their parents.

377
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:57,256
Control yourself, Faber!
We’re at court!

378
00:28:57,395 --> 00:28:59,022
This is no court!
It’s a pigsty!

379
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:01,165
Faber, you’ll get in trouble.

380
00:29:01,332 --> 00:29:02,822
Many young ones.

381
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,105
A thousand niceties.

382
00:29:20,852 --> 00:29:24,151
Frederika and Mina Fibelkorn.
Both just under 18.

383
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:29,721
Real wild roses...

384
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:37,459
But, maiden, why so shy?

385
00:29:37,635 --> 00:29:41,571
Show the Duke your nice legs.

386
00:29:46,144 --> 00:29:48,112
She’s crying.

387
00:29:48,313 --> 00:29:52,773
Don’t cry, maiden.
Why should you cry?

388
00:29:53,017 --> 00:29:58,819
Would you teach your old master
to dance?

389
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,530
May I invite the Damsel?

390
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,291
I don’t dance, Financial Advisor.

391
00:30:11,803 --> 00:30:14,601
Would you not obey your Duke?

392
00:30:15,506 --> 00:30:16,666
My Duke?

393
00:30:16,808 --> 00:30:18,400
Who else?

394
00:30:30,555 --> 00:30:32,386
Stay outside the door.

395
00:30:37,428 --> 00:30:42,798
Surely you didn’t expect
to see me here so soon.

396
00:30:42,934 --> 00:30:45,266
I wouldn’t have wanted to.

397
00:30:45,403 --> 00:30:48,065
Why is this pretty mouth so serious?

398
00:30:48,206 --> 00:30:52,370
Actually I had hoped to see you
laughing, as you did on the road.

399
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,603
This is no dance!

400
00:30:54,746 --> 00:30:59,046
Hot lips, cold heart.
Isn’t that so?

401
00:30:59,183 --> 00:31:05,122
Or can your heart fulfill
what your mouth promises?

402
00:31:05,256 --> 00:31:06,689
Don’t!

403
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:09,793
Would the damsel care to dance?

404
00:31:09,928 --> 00:31:12,488
Not anymore!

405
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,259
Where are you going?

406
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:18,459
I’m looking for my father.

407
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:22,166
- Dance with me!
- Pardon!

408
00:31:22,307 --> 00:31:25,606
Will the damsel care
to dine with me?

409
00:31:25,743 --> 00:31:26,903
No, she won’t.

410
00:31:27,045 --> 00:31:29,013
My child is going home.

411
00:31:29,147 --> 00:31:30,341
I see.

412
00:31:31,115 --> 00:31:38,112
Are impertinences accepted,
or won’t she be allowed some fun?

413
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:39,881
Excuse me, if you please.

414
00:31:41,626 --> 00:31:43,924
What’s your name, little one?

415
00:31:44,062 --> 00:31:45,962
Mina Fibelkorn.

416
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:51,033
Are you afraid of me?

417
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:53,834
No.

418
00:31:53,972 --> 00:31:59,342
Come on, don’t be a bore.

419
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:00,969
I go along.

420
00:32:01,112 --> 00:32:02,238
Queen.

421
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,677
King wins!

422
00:32:03,815 --> 00:32:05,942
I bring you luck, my angel.

423
00:32:06,084 --> 00:32:09,781
I could use some,
with this money monger.

424
00:32:13,524 --> 00:32:16,891
You’re throwing a lot of money
away here. Honest earnings?

425
00:32:17,028 --> 00:32:19,656
What is that to you, brother?

426
00:32:19,831 --> 00:32:22,732
- I’m no brother of yours!
- Ace! I go along.

427
00:32:22,867 --> 00:32:24,858
Jack is trump.

428
00:32:25,603 --> 00:32:27,264
That lovely money!

429
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:28,872
You are so at ease with it,

430
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,009
as if you don’t know
how hard it is to earn it.

431
00:32:32,143 --> 00:32:35,237
Money has no smell.
Even the ancient Romans knew that.

432
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,247
Should I be holier
than the Roman emperor?

433
00:32:38,383 --> 00:32:40,908
Jack, Queen, King!
Three times!

434
00:32:42,453 --> 00:32:43,442
Nice sound.

435
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:45,579
A nice lot, you are!
Choking in money!

436
00:32:45,723 --> 00:32:47,588
It’s all blood money!

437
00:32:47,725 --> 00:32:49,716
Blood money?
And a Jew plays with it?

438
00:32:49,861 --> 00:32:51,226
He gambles for Württemberg!

439
00:32:51,362 --> 00:32:54,331
A Jew plays for your daughters,
and the Duke holds the bank!

440
00:32:54,499 --> 00:32:55,966
You insult the Duke!
That will cost you your life!

441
00:32:56,134 --> 00:32:59,797
- You must catch me first, Jew!
- You rebel!

442
00:33:00,838 --> 00:33:03,568
Unmask yourselves! Hebrews!

443
00:33:08,546 --> 00:33:09,638
The ass!

444
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:11,305
My heart is pounding like crazy!

445
00:33:12,183 --> 00:33:14,048
Whoever insults me insults the Duke!

446
00:33:14,185 --> 00:33:19,316
There is still some difference.
Don’t make such a fuss.

447
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:22,290
- Pour me a drink!
- Your Highness...

448
00:33:22,427 --> 00:33:28,991
Please consider that as long
as Jews are forbidden entry,

449
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:32,933
any vagabond is free
to insult your minister.

450
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:41,177
All right, then, have your wish.
I allow Jews to enter Stuttgart.

451
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:43,143
Is this law?

452
00:33:43,281 --> 00:33:46,273
If I say it, it is law.

453
00:33:47,852 --> 00:33:50,650
Thank you, Your Highness.

454
00:33:50,788 --> 00:33:54,815
But if I am Your Highness"
loyal servant...

455
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:56,449
Is this not enough for you?

456
00:33:56,594 --> 00:33:59,392
Not me, Your Highness.

457
00:33:59,564 --> 00:34:02,431
If I am to be successful,
Your Highness,

458
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:04,159
I must have a document
ensuring our safety.

459
00:34:04,335 --> 00:34:07,133
- A document?
- Yes.

460
00:34:07,271 --> 00:34:11,674
One stating that all my actions
are on behalf of Your Highness

461
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:14,004
and wished by Your Highness,

462
00:34:14,145 --> 00:34:17,603
and that in any case
I have Your Highness" protection.

463
00:34:17,748 --> 00:34:22,685
Really, this is the worst impudence
I have ever encountered.

464
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,779
So Your Highness thinks a Stuttgart
citizen should go unpunished

465
00:34:26,924 --> 00:34:30,917
after attacking your Financial Advisor
with a hammer?

466
00:34:31,896 --> 00:34:32,692
Who did this?

467
00:34:32,864 --> 00:34:35,059
The blacksmith Hans Bogner.

468
00:34:40,004 --> 00:34:42,802
The blacksmith Hans Bogner
shall be hung.

469
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:01,857
Don’t you feel ill, Süss?

470
00:35:01,993 --> 00:35:03,961
Have no fear.

471
00:35:04,095 --> 00:35:08,532
I have the Duke’s letter
ensuring our safe conduct.

472
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:10,291
Jews'whore!

473
00:35:10,468 --> 00:35:12,698
Did you hear that, Joseph?

474
00:35:13,204 --> 00:35:15,798
Watch out, Jew! You’re next!

475
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,532
Arrest him!

476
00:35:17,675 --> 00:35:19,472
You have enough enemies, Joseph.

477
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:22,977
They can’t hang me
higher than that Hans Bogner.

478
00:35:23,114 --> 00:35:26,174
You think so,
Mister Financial Advisor?

479
00:36:07,592 --> 00:36:10,425
Jews are moving into town
by the hundreds. People are wild.

480
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:12,859
They’re coming in like locusts.

481
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,191
Oppenheimer levies all taxes.

482
00:36:15,366 --> 00:36:17,960
The Jew has got his hand
on money, on salt, on beer,

483
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:20,126
on wine, even on grain.

484
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:22,238
Also our wives and daughters.

485
00:36:22,406 --> 00:36:24,670
Get a hold on yourselves.
Has the complaint been lodged?

486
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:26,970
The Duke has outlawed
any written complaint.

487
00:36:27,111 --> 00:36:30,103
He can’t. He took an oath
under the constitution.

488
00:36:30,248 --> 00:36:32,409
You’ll scorch your mouths,
honored sirs.

489
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,381
We’d rather do that
than feel our blood boil!

490
00:36:34,518 --> 00:36:40,354
Our mouths are our own,
but our blood is our children’s blood!

491
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:42,183
- Announce me to the Duke!
- Now?

492
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:44,760
- Announce me.
- He’s asleep!

493
00:36:44,895 --> 00:36:46,328
Then wake him up.

494
00:36:48,132 --> 00:36:50,123
- Your Excellency.
- I must see His Highness.

495
00:36:50,301 --> 00:36:51,290
It’s impossible.

496
00:36:51,469 --> 00:36:55,132
I saved his life once.
Don’t act so important.

497
00:36:55,273 --> 00:36:58,936
I’m sure the Duke hasn’t forgotten
his great debt, Your Excellency.

498
00:36:59,076 --> 00:37:00,373
That’s right.

499
00:37:04,782 --> 00:37:06,443
Brothers!

500
00:37:07,218 --> 00:37:12,451
It’s good that you came.

501
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:15,525
Bring us wine.

502
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,127
Let’s have a drink.

503
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:22,863
Well, what is it then?

504
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,133
My Duke, I come in the name
of the Council, about the Jews.

505
00:37:30,641 --> 00:37:34,543
Well? What do my people want?

506
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:36,738
All of Württemberg is furious,
Your Highness.

507
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,744
And what do you suggest?

508
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:46,118
My General, I have stood by you
under fire on the battlefield,

509
00:37:46,257 --> 00:37:51,957
and I am used to marching straight
and saying what I think.

510
00:37:52,096 --> 00:37:56,760
And what I think is this:
Send away the Jew and stick to us.

511
00:37:58,269 --> 00:38:02,228
- Are you on their side?
- With all my heart, sir.

512
00:38:02,373 --> 00:38:05,209
He is on their side
and has access to His Highness!

513
00:38:05,509 --> 00:38:07,909
- That’s impossible!
- He’s right in the room.

514
00:38:08,045 --> 00:38:10,070
I’ve got to see for myself.

515
00:38:12,283 --> 00:38:16,913
Words, words, words!
Once and for all!

516
00:38:17,054 --> 00:38:21,115
The Councilmen aren’t
supposed to terrorize their Duke

517
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:23,556
or contradict his wishes.

518
00:38:23,694 --> 00:38:27,221
If Your Highness doesn’t act
according to the constitution,

519
00:38:27,398 --> 00:38:30,959
you should at least
adhere to Luther’s advice.

520
00:38:31,135 --> 00:38:34,696
And he says,
"Know, thou faithful Christian,

521
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:39,674
that after the Devil thou hast
no worse enemy than a real Jew.

522
00:38:39,977 --> 00:38:44,846
At best, one should set their schools
and synagogues afire,

523
00:38:44,982 --> 00:38:52,582
take away their prayer books
and Talmud study matter,

524
00:38:52,723 --> 00:38:55,624
forbid them money-lending, and..."

525
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,557
Your Luther is nothing to me!

526
00:38:57,695 --> 00:38:59,356
I mean it as an old soldier,

527
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:03,125
if the Jew wants to contaminate
our women with his filth,

528
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,201
that would be your doing, my Duke!

529
00:39:06,337 --> 00:39:10,000
What? Are you accusing me?
I shall have you arrested!

530
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:13,907
Then you should arrest
all of Württemberg, Your Highness!

531
00:39:14,044 --> 00:39:17,207
I just might! Rebels!

532
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:24,852
I could really forget myself
if I go on listening to you.

533
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:29,551
Out! Get out, I say!

534
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:42,601
Servant, my robe!

535
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:46,073
Call my Financial Advisor
Oppenheimer!

536
00:39:49,547 --> 00:39:56,146
The Lord said the people of Israel
would be destroyed by fire and sword.

537
00:39:57,922 --> 00:39:59,856
His Highness calls Your Excellency.

538
00:40:06,764 --> 00:40:14,728
Hear, Oh, Israel, the Lord our God...

539
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:21,307
You have cooked me a real mess
with your Jews.

540
00:40:22,413 --> 00:40:25,576
What should I do
about my Councilmen now?

541
00:40:25,716 --> 00:40:28,184
If Your Highness designs to ask me,

542
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:32,050
I would advise him to destroy them
with fire and sword!

543
00:40:32,189 --> 00:40:35,022
Destroy them? How?

544
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:38,094
Dissolve the Council, establish
a cabinet of trusted persons,

545
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:41,721
and silence the main screamers,
especially this Sturm.

546
00:40:49,673 --> 00:40:51,766
Süss, Süss!

547
00:40:55,145 --> 00:40:59,514
You show me dangerous paths!

548
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,551
One must believe in one’s stars,
Your Highness.

549
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:07,082
You know about the stars?

550
00:41:07,224 --> 00:41:10,159
I know someone who does.

551
00:41:10,294 --> 00:41:14,560
Just wish it, and he’ll show you
the constellation,

552
00:41:14,732 --> 00:41:17,701
and Your Highness
will be reassured, I know it.

553
00:41:17,868 --> 00:41:20,860
The ascendants are favorable now.

554
00:41:21,138 --> 00:41:24,441
The ascendants are favorable, Rabbi.

555
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:25,373
The ascendants are favorable, Rabbi.

556
00:41:28,546 --> 00:41:31,208
Because they must be.

557
00:41:31,348 --> 00:41:33,441
Can one say they must be?

558
00:41:33,584 --> 00:41:37,145
Can one order them at will?

559
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:40,348
One cannot order
the stars in their orbits,

560
00:41:40,491 --> 00:41:43,824
but can one not order
the orbits of men,

561
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:49,456
if one makes them believe
that God orders the stars" orbits?

562
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:51,658
My son Joseph,

563
00:41:51,835 --> 00:41:58,707
the Lord sees you and how you’ve
grown vain and proud as a peacock.

564
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:03,072
Heavy is the Lord’s blow
when Jews forget who they are.

565
00:42:03,213 --> 00:42:04,612
What should I do, Rabbi?

566
00:42:04,748 --> 00:42:07,979
Don’t you live in a palace
like King Solomon’s?

567
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:11,144
Don’t you sleep in a golden bed?

568
00:42:11,755 --> 00:42:18,183
Don’t you have walls covered
with books that you’ll never read?

569
00:42:20,464 --> 00:42:24,662
This damask costs 12 tallers!

570
00:42:24,802 --> 00:42:26,667
But, Rabbi!

571
00:42:28,238 --> 00:42:33,266
The Lord wants His people in ashes,
dispersed all over the world.

572
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:38,313
He rules in mysterious ways
over the peoples of this earth.

573
00:42:38,983 --> 00:42:42,976
How can I rule if I don’t show myself
to the people?

574
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,554
If you want to rule the goyim,
rule their money.

575
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:49,489
But keep your hands
out of the quarrels of princes.

576
00:42:49,627 --> 00:42:51,595
If I rule the prince,
I rule his people.

577
00:42:51,729 --> 00:42:54,061
The prince will be forgiven,
the Jew hung.

578
00:42:54,231 --> 00:42:56,358
God’s will shall not be disturbed

579
00:42:56,533 --> 00:43:01,232
if I turn Württemberg
into Israel’s promised land.

580
00:43:01,372 --> 00:43:05,638
It is already near.
I have only to grasp it!

581
00:43:05,776 --> 00:43:13,012
I can already see the milk and honey
flowing for the people of Israel.

582
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:18,952
Dare I not reach over Jordan
by God’s will?

583
00:43:19,089 --> 00:43:20,681
Can He not will it?

584
00:43:20,824 --> 00:43:23,554
You interpret His word
at your own convenience.

585
00:43:23,694 --> 00:43:27,130
His word should be understood
in Israel’s favor.

586
00:43:27,297 --> 00:43:30,232
That is God’s will, Rabbi.

587
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:32,028
What should I do? Should I lie?

588
00:43:32,202 --> 00:43:34,102
No need to lie.

589
00:43:34,238 --> 00:43:37,730
Tell him the second truth,
the truth in our way.

590
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:40,275
Sound him his motto "Attento".

591
00:43:40,411 --> 00:43:42,242
What does "Attento" mean?

592
00:43:42,379 --> 00:43:43,869
"He who dares."

593
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:56,423
The Duke.

594
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,925
Remain seated.

595
00:44:00,164 --> 00:44:01,597
Well, what do you see?

596
00:44:01,732 --> 00:44:03,666
The sky, of course.

597
00:44:05,035 --> 00:44:06,525
This man...

598
00:44:06,704 --> 00:44:09,969
Sun.

599
00:44:10,107 --> 00:44:13,372
Square to Jupiter.

600
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:18,538
Jupiter in favorable transit
to ascendant...

601
00:44:18,682 --> 00:44:22,948
God is great,
and wondrous are His signs.

602
00:44:23,087 --> 00:44:24,918
How does the future look?

603
00:44:25,055 --> 00:44:28,889
How can my eyes unfold
what the Lord hides?

604
00:44:29,026 --> 00:44:34,123
He makes the stars and moon revolve,
friends and foes,

605
00:44:34,298 --> 00:44:38,496
but only He knows their meaning.

606
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:41,160
Let me see my stars.

607
00:44:41,338 --> 00:44:48,676
Blessed be the eye which the Lord
allows to see among the myriad...

608
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:50,439
Can you see?

609
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:53,877
What is the name of my star?

610
00:44:54,017 --> 00:44:57,214
The Duke’s star is Mars.

611
00:44:57,354 --> 00:45:01,848
And what is this fiery one called,
there on the horizon?

612
00:45:01,992 --> 00:45:05,484
That one is Venus,
in opposition to Mars.

613
00:45:06,396 --> 00:45:10,059
It shimmers right in my eye.

614
00:45:11,201 --> 00:45:13,829
So tell me, short and clear,
should I dare or not?

615
00:45:13,971 --> 00:45:17,600
Or are the stars against it?

616
00:45:17,741 --> 00:45:22,610
The stars are neither in favor
nor opposed.

617
00:45:22,746 --> 00:45:31,484
But it is written,
they shall obey he who dares.

618
00:45:32,823 --> 00:45:34,415
Here it is, in writing.

619
00:45:34,558 --> 00:45:37,322
He who dares...

620
00:45:38,228 --> 00:45:42,688
That is my motto. Attento.

621
00:45:45,135 --> 00:45:49,435
All right, I’ll take the chance.

622
00:45:49,573 --> 00:45:52,667
Süss, set up your cabinet.

623
00:45:55,212 --> 00:45:56,941
You may come in.

624
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:00,217
My dear friend,
thank you, indeed, for coming!

625
00:46:00,217 --> 00:46:03,675
My dear friend,
thank you, indeed, for coming!

626
00:46:03,821 --> 00:46:08,451
Please be seated. We meet in private.
Let us lay aside all formalities.

627
00:46:08,592 --> 00:46:12,084
You trust me, and I shall act
to deserve your trust.

628
00:46:12,462 --> 00:46:15,659
Our Honored Sovereign
has nursed the intention

629
00:46:15,833 --> 00:46:19,826
to surround himself
with men whom he trusts,

630
00:46:20,003 --> 00:46:23,166
and his attention
has directed itself to you.

631
00:46:23,307 --> 00:46:27,573
- I wouldn’t know why.
- That is why I summoned you.

632
00:46:27,711 --> 00:46:35,982
The Duke intends to create
a new cabinet with you in charge.

633
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:39,816
I cannot accept this.
I am sworn in loyalty to the Council.

634
00:46:39,957 --> 00:46:41,584
You are also sworn in faith
to the Duke.

635
00:46:41,725 --> 00:46:43,818
I do my duty.

636
00:46:43,961 --> 00:46:47,590
So does the Duke, my friend.
Don’t you want to help him?

637
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:50,733
I mistrust his advisor.

638
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:59,109
I know that from reliable sources.

639
00:46:59,243 --> 00:47:01,803
Do you understand?

640
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:06,882
But why should we be foes
when we could be more than friends?

641
00:47:07,017 --> 00:47:09,178
You have a charming daughter.

642
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:11,014
How is she involved in this?

643
00:47:11,154 --> 00:47:16,615
You’ll understand if I tell you
that I am set on marrying her.

644
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,125
My daughter?

645
00:47:18,262 --> 00:47:21,857
In every way, Councilman.

646
00:47:22,032 --> 00:47:24,057
It is impossible.

647
00:47:24,234 --> 00:47:27,931
No, I am sorry, no.

648
00:47:28,071 --> 00:47:33,634
You will not say no.
You will say yes and yes again.

649
00:47:33,777 --> 00:47:36,803
If you contemplate the matter
at any length.

650
00:47:36,947 --> 00:47:41,577
No contemplation is needed.
My daughter is betrothed.

651
00:47:41,718 --> 00:47:47,554
Really? You have time to reconsider
until tomorrow.

652
00:47:47,691 --> 00:47:49,591
See you tomorrow, then.

653
00:47:54,464 --> 00:47:58,867
I join your hands
before the Lord’s eyes.

654
00:47:59,102 --> 00:48:01,536
Pure as gold shall your love remain.

655
00:48:01,705 --> 00:48:05,869
Endless like this ring
will you remain faithful.

656
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:09,410
You shall always look back
upon this very day

657
00:48:09,546 --> 00:48:13,073
and know nothing is great
that is not good.

658
00:48:13,216 --> 00:48:16,276
Nothing is true that does not exist.

659
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:20,686
Be man and wife,
united before God in heaven

660
00:48:20,824 --> 00:48:23,292
until death do you part.

661
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:28,830
I have the honor, Mister Chairman.

662
00:48:28,966 --> 00:48:30,365
Mister Financial Advisor.

663
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,559
Your time is up.

664
00:48:32,736 --> 00:48:36,172
I stand by my decision.
It hasn’t changed overnight.

665
00:48:37,074 --> 00:48:38,974
You know very well that my daughter

666
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:41,577
and my Secretary,
Mister Faber, are betrothed.

667
00:48:41,712 --> 00:48:43,976
You have a father’s right
to change your decision.

668
00:48:44,114 --> 00:48:48,050
Even if I can, I will not.

669
00:48:48,185 --> 00:48:51,177
My daughter will not bear
Jewish children.

670
00:48:54,725 --> 00:48:55,714
So...

671
00:48:55,859 --> 00:48:57,656
I see we understand each other.

672
00:48:57,794 --> 00:49:04,927
It could be dangerous
to defy a man in my position.

673
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:09,498
- Please consider this.
- I have nothing to consider.

674
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:12,199
My daughter is already married.

675
00:49:12,843 --> 00:49:14,140
Since when?

676
00:49:14,277 --> 00:49:15,904
Since last night.

677
00:49:19,683 --> 00:49:24,416
Where do you get your impudence?

678
00:49:24,554 --> 00:49:29,287
For heaven’s sake,
I am the Chairman of the Council!

679
00:49:29,426 --> 00:49:34,420
And as such, I ask you, where
do you actually get the impudence

680
00:49:34,598 --> 00:49:38,864
to disturb the peace of my family,
of this land,

681
00:49:39,002 --> 00:49:45,498
to advise the Duke
against his own Council?

682
00:49:45,642 --> 00:49:49,840
Where do you get your impudence,
you filthy dog,

683
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:54,144
to sow discord between
the Duke and his people?

684
00:49:54,284 --> 00:49:58,846
I thank the Councilman for his sincere
and brave opinions.

685
00:50:00,057 --> 00:50:01,649
Fresh air!

686
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:04,318
Write!

687
00:50:05,328 --> 00:50:07,626
What is it, Joseph?
Why shout at me like this?

688
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:13,532
Write: On grounds of evidence
of sworn, responsible witnesses,

689
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:18,698
he is charged with rebellious
and dishonorable intentions,

690
00:50:18,842 --> 00:50:25,111
and is instrumental in a conspiracy
against His Highness, the Duke.

691
00:50:25,248 --> 00:50:29,344
The Finance Ministry
will handle this affair immediately.

692
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:30,578
Who is charged?

693
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,023
Councilman Sturm.

694
00:50:34,391 --> 00:50:35,858
Where is the answer?

695
00:50:37,094 --> 00:50:40,291
I do not acknowledge your right to
judge nor this place as a courtroom.

696
00:50:40,464 --> 00:50:44,127
Mister Councilman, we act
under the instructions of the Duke.

697
00:50:44,301 --> 00:50:47,600
It’s useless! If Jews sit in judgment
over citizens here,

698
00:50:47,737 --> 00:50:49,898
it is in defiance
of Württemberg law and honor.

699
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:55,569
Sturm, I am convinced you have
no debts to your name.

700
00:50:55,712 --> 00:50:58,977
Really? Convinced?
Come on, get to the point.

701
00:50:59,116 --> 00:51:04,952
Did you not, on Sunday
the 27th of last month,

702
00:51:05,088 --> 00:51:09,787
prepare an assault against
our most honored Duke?

703
00:51:09,926 --> 00:51:12,986
This is becoming ridiculous!
Let’s hear more!

704
00:51:13,763 --> 00:51:17,699
Did you not on that Sunday,
in the presence of witnesses,

705
00:51:17,868 --> 00:51:20,701
namely in the home
of Councilman Weissensee,

706
00:51:20,837 --> 00:51:25,900
say, "Hans Bogner, the blacksmith,
was murdered"?

707
00:51:27,878 --> 00:51:29,778
Did you or did you not say that?

708
00:51:29,913 --> 00:51:31,312
Yes, I did! So?

709
00:51:32,983 --> 00:51:35,850
Don’t joke with me.

710
00:51:35,986 --> 00:51:40,252
If a murder was committed,
who is then the murderer?

711
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:44,520
Of course,
he who brought him to trial.

712
00:51:44,661 --> 00:51:47,357
And who brought him to trial?

713
00:51:47,531 --> 00:51:50,398
Who signed the death sentence?

714
00:51:50,534 --> 00:51:52,968
The Duke, of course.

715
00:51:53,136 --> 00:51:56,833
So, the murderer, in your opinion,
is the Duke.

716
00:51:56,973 --> 00:52:00,739
- Oh, so that’s the idea!
- Yes, sir.

717
00:52:00,877 --> 00:52:06,907
There is no doubt as to the fate
that awaits murderers,

718
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:09,883
even in the case
of the worthiest of dukes.

719
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:14,150
I’d bring to court the Kaiser himself
if he offended the law.

720
00:52:14,291 --> 00:52:19,627
Even His Majesty the Kaiser
is not held holy by this man!

721
00:52:19,763 --> 00:52:20,457
I’m going mad!

722
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:25,192
So do you still think that the charges
of treason are not just?

723
00:52:25,368 --> 00:52:30,499
If the names of the Kaiser
and the Duke have been defiled,

724
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,406
it is by your own filth!

725
00:52:34,544 --> 00:52:37,240
Sturm, Sturm, you entangle
yourself more and more!

726
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:42,079
Councilman Metz, don’t you see
how things are twisted here

727
00:52:42,219 --> 00:52:44,949
only to destroy me?

728
00:52:45,088 --> 00:52:47,056
Will you take a part in the plot

729
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:50,717
that this Talmudic Jew-mind
has cooked up?

730
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:53,920
I forbid you any form of insult,
Councilman!

731
00:52:54,097 --> 00:52:58,534
He will no longer have the opportunity
to insult you.

732
00:52:58,702 --> 00:53:02,729
We shall know how to protect you
from such riff-raff.

733
00:53:02,872 --> 00:53:05,966
Come in. Are you afraid?

734
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:09,702
Tonight you sleep in my bed,
and I’ll sleep downstairs.

735
00:53:09,846 --> 00:53:12,815
But, Dorle, you don’t even know
whether your father approves.

736
00:53:12,949 --> 00:53:16,976
Come in already, and help me.
I can’t do this by myself.

737
00:53:17,654 --> 00:53:21,283
Why should he mind?
We are husband and wife.

738
00:53:21,424 --> 00:53:24,291
He has to get used to that.

739
00:53:24,427 --> 00:53:26,327
Oh, Dorle.

740
00:53:26,496 --> 00:53:28,589
You’re sighing already!

741
00:53:28,765 --> 00:53:31,199
I am already used to the idea.

742
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:34,303
I have looked forward to this.

743
00:53:34,471 --> 00:53:37,372
But I imagined
a different wedding for us.

744
00:53:37,507 --> 00:53:38,997
Me too.

745
00:53:39,142 --> 00:53:40,871
I think Father is very grieved.

746
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:41,841
Because of the Jew?

747
00:53:41,978 --> 00:53:45,573
Especially the haste in which
everything had to be done.

748
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:52,254
Karli, in all my years,
I’ve never dined without Father.

749
00:53:52,389 --> 00:53:56,325
And today of all days,
our wedding day, he left us alone.

750
00:53:56,459 --> 00:53:59,826
But believe me, Karli,
even so we may be happy.

751
00:53:59,963 --> 00:54:05,424
Now you are my husband,
my protector, and my happiness.

752
00:54:12,475 --> 00:54:14,739
You always come
at the wrong moment.

753
00:54:15,979 --> 00:54:18,641
Master Roeder is here,
and is looking for Miss...

754
00:54:18,782 --> 00:54:21,342
for Madame...

755
00:54:21,484 --> 00:54:23,384
Did he ask for me,
or for my father as well?

756
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,784
No, for you, and for Mister Faber.

757
00:54:27,824 --> 00:54:32,693
Good evening, Master von Roeder.
You’ve come to congratulate us?

758
00:54:32,829 --> 00:54:34,296
It’s not the right moment.

759
00:54:34,464 --> 00:54:40,369
Your father is held
at the castle by force.

760
00:54:40,537 --> 00:54:42,368
Why?

761
00:54:42,505 --> 00:54:43,972
I don’t know.

762
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:46,505
The Jew?

763
00:54:46,643 --> 00:54:48,133
I bring him the summons
to the Council meeting

764
00:54:48,278 --> 00:54:51,213
because I didn’t want anyone else
to break the news to you.

765
00:54:51,348 --> 00:54:54,112
In one hour, a meeting will be held
at the Council House.

766
00:54:55,018 --> 00:54:57,646
- Councilman Weissensee?
- Here!

767
00:54:57,787 --> 00:55:00,381
- Mayor of Tübingen?
- Here!

768
00:55:00,523 --> 00:55:01,683
- Mayor of Kronstadt?
- Here!

769
00:55:01,825 --> 00:55:03,053
- Mayor of Ludwigsburg?
- Here!

770
00:55:03,193 --> 00:55:04,217
- Mayor of Weinsberg?
- Here!

771
00:55:04,361 --> 00:55:06,352
- And Brankenheim?
- Here!

772
00:55:06,529 --> 00:55:08,622
Master blacksmith
Peter Eugen Penter?

773
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:10,095
Here!

774
00:55:10,233 --> 00:55:11,564
All here, save for one.

775
00:55:11,701 --> 00:55:15,603
And where that one is,
everyone in this room knows.

776
00:55:15,739 --> 00:55:17,263
Well, free him!

777
00:55:17,407 --> 00:55:19,068
Patience. It’s not that simple.

778
00:55:19,209 --> 00:55:20,767
You know as well as I do
who got him arrested,

779
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:22,571
and he is higher ranking than ever.

780
00:55:22,712 --> 00:55:24,407
As long as our Duke listens to him,

781
00:55:24,547 --> 00:55:28,347
the Council could soon have no say
here in Württemberg.

782
00:55:28,485 --> 00:55:29,509
What would that mean?

783
00:55:29,652 --> 00:55:31,449
That the Duke defies the constitution.

784
00:55:31,588 --> 00:55:33,852
He wants to set up a cabinet
and dissolve the Council.

785
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:35,355
And that is in defiance
of the constitution.

786
00:55:35,492 --> 00:55:37,119
He wouldn’t!

787
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,160
It would not be the first time.

788
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:42,924
It has happened before,
that the constitution was overlooked.

789
00:55:43,867 --> 00:55:46,335
Scandalous!

790
00:55:46,503 --> 00:55:50,803
I move we prevent
this act of his with force.

791
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,875
And demand the release
of Councilman Sturm.

792
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:57,309
All in favor, raise your hands.

793
00:55:58,314 --> 00:56:00,714
On the charge of outrageous acts

794
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:03,148
against the government
and my own person,

795
00:56:03,286 --> 00:56:09,850
I’ve decided to call you, gentlemen,
in special assembly

796
00:56:09,993 --> 00:56:13,053
chaired solely by myself.

797
00:56:14,731 --> 00:56:16,722
It has been brought to my attention

798
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:23,464
that last night a special meeting
of the Council took place,

799
00:56:23,606 --> 00:56:29,238
in which, as my advisor
Mister Oppenheimer informs me,

800
00:56:29,379 --> 00:56:34,180
it was suggested that I’d be arrested.

801
00:56:34,317 --> 00:56:38,253
In case this arrest were met
with resistance, I was to be executed.

802
00:56:40,523 --> 00:56:44,220
Therefore, for my safety,

803
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:48,524
I have decided to dissolve
the Council immediately.

804
00:56:49,532 --> 00:56:53,229
The appropriate edict is in the hands
of Mister Oppenheimer.

805
00:56:53,369 --> 00:56:54,267
Thank you, gentlemen.

806
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:11,287
I want to know everything
the Jew and the Duke discuss.

807
00:57:11,421 --> 00:57:13,548
Yes, Your Excellency.

808
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:16,887
His Highness invites Your Excellency
to his study.

809
00:57:22,198 --> 00:57:24,689
Excuse me, Your Highness,
for interfering.

810
00:57:24,868 --> 00:57:26,893
The Councilmen have sent me...

811
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:29,197
I know, Master von Roeder.

812
00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:33,571
I don’t need
to be informed of it by you.

813
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:38,374
You can see then, Your Highness,
how greatly we care for you.

814
00:57:38,515 --> 00:57:42,952
Your well-being is endangered,
but it’s not too late.

815
00:57:43,086 --> 00:57:44,713
Not too late?

816
00:57:44,854 --> 00:57:47,482
People are rebelling
against their Duke,

817
00:57:47,624 --> 00:57:49,683
plotting with such traitors as Sturm,

818
00:57:49,826 --> 00:57:53,785
resolutions are declared,
armed threats are made!

819
00:57:53,963 --> 00:57:57,729
- What do you call that?
- Open rage.

820
00:57:58,468 --> 00:58:01,335
So? What do you say about this?

821
00:58:01,471 --> 00:58:02,631
The same again, my Duke.

822
00:58:02,772 --> 00:58:04,262
Away with the Jew!

823
00:58:04,707 --> 00:58:09,701
Your Highness, if I have become
the stumbling-block...

824
00:58:10,146 --> 00:58:16,381
I want to tell you something,
Master von Roeder.

825
00:58:17,053 --> 00:58:21,615
Your Councilmen are a nuisance!

826
00:58:22,425 --> 00:58:24,985
The best soldier
has no more notion of government

827
00:58:25,128 --> 00:58:26,652
than an ox has in playing the fiddle.

828
00:58:26,829 --> 00:58:28,922
But my Financial Advisor is a genius!

829
00:58:29,098 --> 00:58:31,862
He earns me money,
power, and good counsel!

830
00:58:32,001 --> 00:58:34,060
- He wins me...
- Enemies.

831
00:58:34,237 --> 00:58:35,033
Nothing but enemies.

832
00:58:35,171 --> 00:58:40,837
I shall crush you, Master von Roeder.

833
00:58:40,977 --> 00:58:43,605
I have nothing further to say to you.
Out! Out!

834
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:54,586
That man is right, unfortunately.

835
00:58:59,028 --> 00:59:06,025
You arouse resistance to me,
more than I can handle.

836
00:59:06,202 --> 00:59:09,638
Sovereigns have been known
to deal with resistance

837
00:59:09,806 --> 00:59:12,798
if they have reliable friends.

838
00:59:12,942 --> 00:59:15,638
I have no friends.

839
00:59:15,778 --> 00:59:18,372
I shall make you some,
Your Highness. Strong friends.

840
00:59:18,514 --> 00:59:20,539
I shall make the contacts.

841
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:24,312
- How do you mean to do this?
- I have already started.

842
00:59:24,454 --> 00:59:26,149
With the court at Würzburg.

843
00:59:27,323 --> 00:59:33,387
The solidarity of sovereigns
should not be underestimated.

844
00:59:33,529 --> 00:59:38,125
The Würzburg Duke has soldiers
that could be borrowed.

845
00:59:40,803 --> 00:59:48,073
Borrow soldiers?
Soldiers to be borrowed?

846
00:59:49,946 --> 00:59:54,042
This is really a Jew’s way
of thinking, out of the book.

847
00:59:54,183 --> 00:59:57,175
But it is a good thought,
Your Highness.

848
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,923
Remchingen, come here.

849
01:00:00,923 --> 01:00:01,617
Remchingen, come here.

850
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:09,025
What’s he suggesting, Remchingen?

851
01:00:09,899 --> 01:00:16,270
Should an open feud break out
between me and my Swabians?

852
01:00:16,439 --> 01:00:19,272
You yourself are a Swabian,
Remchingen.

853
01:00:19,409 --> 01:00:22,845
Your Duke is a Swabian himself,
Remchingen.

854
01:00:22,979 --> 01:00:25,379
The Swabians
don’t mean anything to the Jew.

855
01:00:26,349 --> 01:00:29,477
Are you aggravated, Karl Alexander?

856
01:00:29,619 --> 01:00:31,450
Eavesdropping?

857
01:00:33,389 --> 01:00:37,450
You spoke so loudly,
there was no need to eavesdrop.

858
01:00:37,593 --> 01:00:38,651
Do what he says.

859
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:42,856
What do you know about politics,
my child?

860
01:00:43,032 --> 01:00:45,125
Nothing at all.

861
01:00:45,301 --> 01:00:47,667
But I know something about men.

862
01:00:47,804 --> 01:00:50,432
Trust your Financial Advisor.

863
01:00:50,573 --> 01:00:52,598
Do you love me?

864
01:00:52,742 --> 01:00:58,806
Yes. I’d love you even more
if you were as clever as...

865
01:00:58,948 --> 01:01:01,439
As your friend Oppenheimer?

866
01:01:02,285 --> 01:01:07,018
The way you were
before Belgrade and Peternardein.

867
01:01:07,156 --> 01:01:09,021
I was young then.

868
01:01:09,158 --> 01:01:11,422
You could still be.

869
01:01:11,561 --> 01:01:13,654
Just do what your friend advises.

870
01:01:15,131 --> 01:01:19,534
Is he my friend?

871
01:01:19,669 --> 01:01:21,296
I think so.

872
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,538
Remchingen, leave me with her.

873
01:01:26,676 --> 01:01:29,110
No, I leave you, gentlemen.

874
01:01:30,413 --> 01:01:33,780
I cross my fingers for you,
Karl Alexander.

875
01:01:43,926 --> 01:01:47,089
I’m not free to decide.

876
01:01:47,263 --> 01:01:50,755
But, Your Highness, why not?

877
01:01:52,702 --> 01:02:03,704
You think I have followed your advice
so I should continue.

878
01:02:03,846 --> 01:02:05,404
Whether I want to or not.

879
01:02:05,548 --> 01:02:08,381
You’ve won the Duchess" heart.

880
01:02:08,518 --> 01:02:10,383
- Only her heart?
- I don’t understand.

881
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:14,217
- Is it only her heart you’ve won?
- What do you mean?

882
01:02:14,357 --> 01:02:21,263
I mean that nothing is holy to you,
not even your Duke’s wife, Jew.

883
01:02:21,397 --> 01:02:25,231
Only your own interests,
your profits.

884
01:02:25,368 --> 01:02:27,359
Your Highness seems to mistrust me.

885
01:02:27,537 --> 01:02:31,997
Yes, I mistrust you.

886
01:02:32,909 --> 01:02:38,074
Sturm! Sturm! Sturm!

887
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:49,148
This is how revolutions break out.

888
01:02:49,292 --> 01:02:52,489
If one shot is fired,
everyone will panic.

889
01:02:52,628 --> 01:02:54,653
The palace guard
consists of a thousand men.

890
01:02:54,831 --> 01:02:59,165
There will be a terrible bloodbath
if Your Highness decides to wait.

891
01:02:59,302 --> 01:03:03,068
The people must be confronted
by a force they won’t dare resist.

892
01:03:04,006 --> 01:03:05,633
Is it true that in Pfalzneuburg

893
01:03:05,775 --> 01:03:09,541
the Würzburg Duke offered military aid
to hold things in line?

894
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:12,512
Sure, Your Highness.
Mister von Remchingen will agree.

895
01:03:12,648 --> 01:03:13,910
Is that true?

896
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:16,211
Certainly, Your Highness.

897
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:19,952
That’s a military takeover.

898
01:03:20,089 --> 01:03:23,718
Your Highness would become
an absolute sovereign.

899
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:26,192
Like the Sun King in Versailles.

900
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:31,293
How much would it cost?
To bring in foreign troops?

901
01:03:31,467 --> 01:03:33,230
How many are needed?

902
01:03:34,403 --> 01:03:36,667
At least four or five thousand men.

903
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,003
Four or five thousand men?
At least...

904
01:03:39,141 --> 01:03:46,206
We’d have to hold the position
at least three to four months.

905
01:03:48,651 --> 01:03:51,279
Well...

906
01:03:52,688 --> 01:03:57,318
But the Jews whom Your Highness
granted entry to Stuttgart

907
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:59,826
owe Your Highness money.

908
01:03:59,962 --> 01:04:03,523
I’ll see to it that
this operation succeeds.

909
01:04:26,255 --> 01:04:27,552
Rabbi!

910
01:04:30,893 --> 01:04:32,087
Rabbi!

911
01:04:58,688 --> 01:05:00,485
You interrupt a holy service.
Can’t you wait?

912
01:05:00,623 --> 01:05:04,753
No, Rabbi. There is no time.
You must speak to the congregation.

913
01:05:04,894 --> 01:05:06,259
So what’s the hurry?

914
01:05:06,395 --> 01:05:09,592
He who has no peace to pray
will go astray and lose his way.

915
01:05:09,765 --> 01:05:11,699
Peace is fine, Rabbi,
where it belongs,

916
01:05:11,934 --> 01:05:14,266
but now I need five times
100,000 talers from the Jews.

917
01:05:14,403 --> 01:05:15,870
From the congregation?
Are you mad?

918
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:21,943
I came to the synagogue
because they are all gathered here.

919
01:05:22,078 --> 01:05:25,980
The Councilmen want the Jews
out of Stuttgart again.

920
01:05:27,717 --> 01:05:29,947
But the Duke is willing
to counter them in one blow.

921
01:05:30,086 --> 01:05:31,678
I’ve convinced him of that.

922
01:05:31,821 --> 01:05:37,316
He should become absolute ruler,
and then he’ll protect us Jews.

923
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:39,394
So should the Jews
become soldiers?

924
01:05:39,528 --> 01:05:42,019
No, just pay.
Soldiers cost money.

925
01:05:42,198 --> 01:05:44,860
You want to wage war with goyim,

926
01:05:45,034 --> 01:05:50,768
want to become a Mordechai
who raised 75,000 for Esther,

927
01:05:50,906 --> 01:05:56,276
then you must take off your
goy clothes first. Dress Jewish.

928
01:05:56,412 --> 01:06:00,314
Rabbi, Rabbi,
you don’t realize this is serious.

929
01:06:00,449 --> 01:06:03,680
But I know,
because I sit at the source,

930
01:06:03,819 --> 01:06:06,515
if the Jews give 500,000 talers today,

931
01:06:06,655 --> 01:06:09,351
I will see to it
that the Duke never forgets

932
01:06:09,492 --> 01:06:13,622
it was the Jews" money
that helped him to his throne.

933
01:06:13,829 --> 01:06:16,992
But if today the Jews are stingy

934
01:06:17,166 --> 01:06:23,696
and hide behind nice Talmudic
sayings, then they will all lose.

935
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:26,774
Even their lives.

936
01:06:28,177 --> 01:06:31,476
Come, sing with us.

937
01:06:31,614 --> 01:06:34,913
The Lord’s will be done,
with you and your thoughts,

938
01:06:35,051 --> 01:06:38,953
and our brothers should see
that you stand by me.

939
01:06:39,088 --> 01:06:41,386
Later we’ll speak with them.

940
01:07:20,362 --> 01:07:20,396
All of my thoughts

941
01:07:20,396 --> 01:07:28,496
All of my thoughts

942
01:07:28,637 --> 01:07:35,133
They are with you

943
01:07:36,212 --> 01:07:40,706
You, my one and only...

944
01:07:53,896 --> 01:08:00,995
Dorothea, you sit so...
What can I say?

945
01:08:01,537 --> 01:08:06,839
I went to church.
I ran through the streets.

946
01:08:06,976 --> 01:08:11,879
I went to the grave.
I prayed, and nothing helps.

947
01:08:12,014 --> 01:08:12,810
Please...

948
01:08:12,948 --> 01:08:21,481
It’s already the third night
and still nothing from Father.

949
01:08:21,624 --> 01:08:26,084
And my husband
has also been away a while now.

950
01:08:29,398 --> 01:08:30,330
Dorothea!

951
01:08:30,466 --> 01:08:35,665
I can’t stand up, you startled me so.

952
01:08:35,804 --> 01:08:39,672
It’s good you’re here, Faber.
Don’t ever leave me alone.

953
01:08:39,808 --> 01:08:43,039
Never leave me alone again.

954
01:08:43,179 --> 01:08:47,616
They were here again this afternoon,
searched everywhere.

955
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:50,685
They search, but they won’t find
a thing against your father.

956
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:53,253
- But I can’t stay with you, Dorothea.
- Where will you go?

957
01:08:53,389 --> 01:08:55,755
Don’t ask me where I was,
nor where I’m going.

958
01:08:55,891 --> 01:08:58,587
Are you going away again?
To the Council House?

959
01:08:58,727 --> 01:09:00,354
The Council House is closed.

960
01:09:00,496 --> 01:09:01,724
The Duke’s guard
is posted in front of it.

961
01:09:01,897 --> 01:09:02,454
Why?

962
01:09:02,631 --> 01:09:04,690
Revolution has broken out
quite openly.

963
01:09:04,867 --> 01:09:05,765
And Father?

964
01:09:05,901 --> 01:09:08,802
We’ll get him out,
you can be sure.

965
01:09:10,206 --> 01:09:12,106
God be with you, Dorle.

966
01:09:12,241 --> 01:09:14,402
Must you go already?

967
01:09:14,777 --> 01:09:18,907
I only came to let you know
that nothing has happened to me.

968
01:09:19,048 --> 01:09:22,245
And if I don’t see you again, Faber,

969
01:09:22,384 --> 01:09:26,821
if this is the last time
I hold you in my arms...

970
01:09:26,956 --> 01:09:30,983
- But, Dorle, I’m sure that...
- Don’t say a thing.

971
01:09:31,126 --> 01:09:34,357
I want to listen
to the beating of your heart.

972
01:09:34,997 --> 01:09:40,299
Papers indicating high treason
were found in your home,

973
01:09:40,436 --> 01:09:43,735
inside your desk,
in your own handwriting.

974
01:09:43,872 --> 01:09:48,332
How many times do I have to tell you?
It’s all forged by that malicious Jew.

975
01:09:48,477 --> 01:09:51,173
The Councilman had better be careful.

976
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:54,441
There are dungeons
in Hohenneuffen, in Asberg,

977
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:56,483
where he’ll see neither the sun
nor the moon.

978
01:09:56,619 --> 01:10:00,487
- Asberg won’t help you silence me.
- My pen moves, and you’re hanged.

979
01:10:00,623 --> 01:10:02,648
I have no fear of dying.

980
01:10:02,791 --> 01:10:04,520
So you’re a hero, what?

981
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:06,457
One never learns. Well, then...

982
01:10:06,595 --> 01:10:10,292
I want to stay alone.
Send the guards away.

983
01:10:11,834 --> 01:10:15,930
Sturm, my intentions are good.

984
01:10:16,105 --> 01:10:19,939
I won’t touch a hair on your head
and release you tonight.

985
01:10:20,075 --> 01:10:22,635
You only have to be willing
to become minister.

986
01:10:22,778 --> 01:10:25,906
So, in your stead, I would also
be glad to have such an offer.

987
01:10:26,982 --> 01:10:29,212
I’d rather hang than break my oath.

988
01:10:29,351 --> 01:10:30,579
I don’t understand you, Sturm.

989
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:36,817
I offer you position, power, title,
honor, as much as you want.

990
01:10:37,826 --> 01:10:40,192
What do you know about honor?

991
01:10:41,964 --> 01:10:44,023
Don’t be so stubborn.

992
01:10:45,768 --> 01:10:51,673
I need your good name
for my ministry.

993
01:10:51,807 --> 01:10:58,838
You and your name would guarantee
the bond of opposites.

994
01:11:00,316 --> 01:11:03,649
- Is that such a big deal?
- Your deal, not mine.

995
01:11:04,753 --> 01:11:07,551
- Is this your final word?
- Absolutely.

996
01:11:08,357 --> 01:11:11,224
Good. But then
the responsibility is yours.

997
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,922
I advise you, for your own sake,
and for the sake of your daughter.

998
01:11:16,098 --> 01:11:19,192
Leave my daughter
out of this dirty business.

999
01:11:19,368 --> 01:11:23,600
Why? Why should she be left out?
Why shouldn’t I ask her?

1000
01:11:23,739 --> 01:11:27,539
Perhaps she’ll take pity
on her suffering father.

1001
01:11:27,676 --> 01:11:33,911
Gentlemen, the Duke
has called for foreign troops!

1002
01:11:34,049 --> 01:11:35,846
No! This is civil war!

1003
01:11:35,984 --> 01:11:38,680
- He wouldn’t dare!
- I know it for sure.

1004
01:11:38,821 --> 01:11:41,915
The Duke’s Turk told me.
The Jew has spun it all.

1005
01:11:42,057 --> 01:11:45,720
The Jews fund the Duke’s war
against his own people.

1006
01:11:45,861 --> 01:11:49,058
- Lf we don’t beat them to it...
- They’ll be here in three days!

1007
01:11:49,231 --> 01:11:52,462
- In three days?
- We have two days.

1008
01:11:52,601 --> 01:11:55,126
Everyone should be armed.

1009
01:11:55,304 --> 01:11:58,000
The orders have to go out tonight!

1010
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:01,371
The gates are doubly guarded!

1011
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:02,943
Try going through
as the Duke’s messenger.

1012
01:12:03,078 --> 01:12:06,673
Not so hasty!
You need the right password.

1013
01:12:06,815 --> 01:12:08,874
The password now
is "Karl Alexander."

1014
01:12:09,685 --> 01:12:11,915
Duke’s messenger! Open up!

1015
01:12:12,054 --> 01:12:13,817
- Password!
- Karl Alexander.

1016
01:12:13,956 --> 01:12:15,617
In the Duke’s name, I arrest you.

1017
01:12:15,758 --> 01:12:16,782
Why is that?

1018
01:12:16,925 --> 01:12:20,691
Tonight’s password is "Attento."
He is no messenger!

1019
01:12:20,863 --> 01:12:24,026
Take him to the Financial Advisor.

1020
01:12:28,437 --> 01:12:30,769
These are the secret orders
we found.

1021
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:48,818
This is Dorothea Sturm's husband.
Herso-very-Christian husband.

1022
01:12:54,196 --> 01:12:55,390
Whose orders are these?

1023
01:12:56,131 --> 01:12:57,189
Turn around!

1024
01:12:59,468 --> 01:13:01,129
Whose orders are these?

1025
01:13:02,237 --> 01:13:04,762
- Will you speak?
- At Württemberg!

1026
01:13:06,408 --> 01:13:08,899
At Württemberg? Really?

1027
01:13:11,447 --> 01:13:16,214
You’ll name your companions.
Who will be ready in two days?

1028
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:18,216
Who should prepare for fighting?

1029
01:13:18,353 --> 01:13:19,615
Will you open your mouth?

1030
01:13:19,755 --> 01:13:24,419
Well, who are the rebels?
Who seeks civil war?

1031
01:13:26,128 --> 01:13:26,958
You do!

1032
01:13:27,095 --> 01:13:32,328
Me? How interesting!

1033
01:13:32,501 --> 01:13:35,163
You want a military takeover.

1034
01:13:35,304 --> 01:13:37,738
You suggested this to the Duke,
didn’t you?

1035
01:13:37,873 --> 01:13:41,809
I ask the questions here, not you.

1036
01:13:41,944 --> 01:13:44,606
And it will hurt you
no less than it will me.

1037
01:13:44,746 --> 01:13:47,044
Take him to the torture chamber.

1038
01:13:47,182 --> 01:13:51,016
Show him no mercy until he speaks.

1039
01:14:32,094 --> 01:14:32,127
What does this say?

1040
01:14:32,127 --> 01:14:34,618
What does this say?

1041
01:14:34,763 --> 01:14:37,425
It says the Councilmen
mean to attack in two days.

1042
01:14:37,599 --> 01:14:38,361
And what about us?

1043
01:14:38,534 --> 01:14:42,903
If we don’t want defeat,
Your Highness, we must hurry.

1044
01:14:43,038 --> 01:14:45,802
It depends on carrying out the plan
quickly tomorrow night.

1045
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:46,908
What now, then?

1046
01:14:47,042 --> 01:14:48,839
I won’t have Wirzburg's forces
by tomorrow.

1047
01:14:48,977 --> 01:14:50,239
We’ll act with our own troops.

1048
01:14:50,379 --> 01:14:53,746
That’s a filthy Jew!

1049
01:14:53,882 --> 01:14:55,713
What are you telling me to do?

1050
01:14:55,851 --> 01:14:58,843
Citizens shooting each other?

1051
01:14:58,987 --> 01:15:01,979
Your Highness need not be present.

1052
01:15:02,124 --> 01:15:05,525
No, I shall not have it!

1053
01:15:05,661 --> 01:15:10,894
Very well, Your Highness wishes
to stay the Council’s lackey.

1054
01:15:11,066 --> 01:15:12,966
Shut up, you rascal!

1055
01:15:13,101 --> 01:15:15,331
I beg to resign.

1056
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:18,997
See, now you want to pressure me.

1057
01:15:19,141 --> 01:15:23,168
Slink out the back door!
Take care, my boy!

1058
01:15:23,312 --> 01:15:26,179
Remchingen, see to it
that the Jew stays near me.

1059
01:15:26,315 --> 01:15:31,651
Does Your Highness
still wish to hear my advice?

1060
01:15:31,787 --> 01:15:33,118
Speak.

1061
01:15:33,255 --> 01:15:38,386
The ball you’ll give for the Kaiser’s
messenger will be the proper scene.

1062
01:15:38,527 --> 01:15:43,328
Tomorrow you go to Ludwigsburg

1063
01:15:43,498 --> 01:15:49,130
and come back a day later
as absolute sovereign.

1064
01:15:52,074 --> 01:15:54,201
Absolute sovereign?

1065
01:15:55,043 --> 01:15:57,910
In one day and one night?

1066
01:15:58,046 --> 01:16:00,412
That would mean a takeover!

1067
01:16:00,549 --> 01:16:03,017
Military takeover, Your Highness.

1068
01:16:03,752 --> 01:16:10,715
All right, I’ll go to Ludwigsburg.

1069
01:16:10,959 --> 01:16:12,654
Inform the Duchess!

1070
01:16:12,794 --> 01:16:14,489
Right away.

1071
01:16:19,568 --> 01:16:22,128
To the chair with him.
But wait for the signal.

1072
01:16:25,374 --> 01:16:30,676
This is where the fingers go.

1073
01:16:32,347 --> 01:16:33,974
Shall we remove the ring?

1074
01:16:34,116 --> 01:16:36,448
- It’s a wedding ring.
- Keep it on.

1075
01:16:36,585 --> 01:16:42,285
It’s shaped like a horseshoe.
For luck.

1076
01:16:44,893 --> 01:16:49,227
Only the Duke may grant
the traitor a pardon, you know that.

1077
01:16:49,398 --> 01:16:51,332
But the Duke is in Ludwigsburg.

1078
01:16:51,466 --> 01:16:54,026
Excellency, I beg you to help me.

1079
01:16:54,202 --> 01:16:58,036
I’ve written everything down.
Here is the application.

1080
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:03,940
What would the Duke want
with your application?

1081
01:17:10,118 --> 01:17:13,815
He’ll tear it up, just as I am doing.

1082
01:17:17,092 --> 01:17:18,252
He will have the traitor shot.

1083
01:17:20,762 --> 01:17:22,423
Mercy!

1084
01:17:29,838 --> 01:17:32,033
Have you no heart?

1085
01:17:37,612 --> 01:17:40,103
I had a heart.

1086
01:17:44,653 --> 01:17:47,520
I was merciful.

1087
01:17:47,656 --> 01:17:51,422
Always, Miss.
Pardon me, Madame.

1088
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:55,360
Nice ring. From your husband?

1089
01:17:57,099 --> 01:17:59,863
In this case,
it is really difficult to help.

1090
01:18:03,572 --> 01:18:07,804
Would you like the ring?
The gem is real.

1091
01:18:10,946 --> 01:18:16,248
Such a little ring
on such a little finger.

1092
01:18:17,018 --> 01:18:21,318
Do you want to see a real ring?
Come with me.

1093
01:18:22,457 --> 01:18:24,288
Well, come on.

1094
01:18:29,798 --> 01:18:32,631
Come on. Are you afraid?

1095
01:18:38,507 --> 01:18:40,134
Just look at it.

1096
01:18:42,744 --> 01:18:47,579
Do you still think I’d be tempted
with your little ring?

1097
01:18:47,716 --> 01:18:49,741
Me? Do you want it?

1098
01:18:59,161 --> 01:19:02,597
You want to free your father
and husband, don’t you?

1099
01:19:02,764 --> 01:19:04,994
This is how you go about it!

1100
01:19:05,167 --> 01:19:06,725
If a bird catcher lets one go,

1101
01:19:06,902 --> 01:19:10,895
he should catch another instead,
isn’t that so?

1102
01:19:13,608 --> 01:19:14,768
The cloth is out! Go!

1103
01:19:18,647 --> 01:19:22,515
So, are you enjoying this?

1104
01:19:24,953 --> 01:19:28,787
- You recognize the voice, don’t you?
- Great God!

1105
01:19:29,124 --> 01:19:31,786
Take the kerchief away!

1106
01:19:33,328 --> 01:19:35,125
What does this mean?

1107
01:19:35,297 --> 01:19:38,460
Do you hear anything?
That’s what it means.

1108
01:19:41,269 --> 01:19:43,635
Then remove it, my child.

1109
01:19:46,107 --> 01:19:47,904
Now give me back my kerchief.

1110
01:19:48,043 --> 01:19:49,533
- No!
- No?

1111
01:19:49,678 --> 01:19:51,805
All right, keep it. But...

1112
01:19:51,947 --> 01:19:54,882
- My Father in heaven...
- What?

1113
01:19:55,016 --> 01:20:00,079
Pray, pray to your God.
Go ahead and pray.

1114
01:20:00,222 --> 01:20:05,182
But not only Christians have a god.
We Jews have one, too.

1115
01:20:05,327 --> 01:20:10,162
An avenging God. An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.

1116
01:20:10,332 --> 01:20:13,529
- Thank your Father in Heaven.
- Let me out.

1117
01:20:13,668 --> 01:20:16,569
Don’t you want me to keep
the traitor from being shot?

1118
01:20:16,705 --> 01:20:18,798
Don’t touch me!

1119
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:23,570
Don’t fret. Later you can have
your Secretary back.

1120
01:20:26,314 --> 01:20:27,482
Stop! Stop!

1121
01:20:27,482 --> 01:20:29,211
Stop! Stop!

1122
01:20:29,885 --> 01:20:32,854
The Secretary is to be released.

1123
01:20:32,988 --> 01:20:34,717
I don’t understand it. Why?

1124
01:20:34,856 --> 01:20:40,317
The Financial Advisor has ordered
to free him immediately.

1125
01:20:40,462 --> 01:20:42,555
How do I understand this?
Get out!

1126
01:20:44,232 --> 01:20:48,293
- Where to?
- Go home.

1127
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:49,937
Home.

1128
01:20:57,612 --> 01:21:00,342
To whom do I owe this?

1129
01:21:00,482 --> 01:21:07,046
Your pretty young wife asked
the Financial Advisor in person.

1130
01:21:07,188 --> 01:21:12,455
- That is not true.
- Yes, it is.

1131
01:21:43,325 --> 01:21:45,850
Is Councilman Sturm’s daughter here?

1132
01:21:45,994 --> 01:21:47,018
Not with me.

1133
01:21:47,162 --> 01:21:48,060
Wait!

1134
01:21:48,196 --> 01:21:53,224
Lots of people knock on this door.
I don’t bother what they do.

1135
01:21:53,401 --> 01:21:55,266
They all seem the same to me.

1136
01:21:55,403 --> 01:22:01,399
- But she was here?
- The girl that cried?

1137
01:22:01,543 --> 01:22:02,908
Where did she go?

1138
01:22:03,044 --> 01:22:07,811
Go after her. That way.

1139
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:15,245
Jew!

1140
01:23:18,186 --> 01:23:19,448
Jew!

1141
01:23:34,035 --> 01:23:38,096
The Jew has this
on his conscience.

1142
01:23:40,575 --> 01:23:41,837
Let go!

1143
01:24:03,131 --> 01:24:05,861
- Attack!
- What are you waiting for?

1144
01:24:06,034 --> 01:24:07,365
The Jew must go!

1145
01:24:07,969 --> 01:24:09,436
The Jew must go!

1146
01:24:47,609 --> 01:24:50,874
I’m here to see the Duke!

1147
01:24:51,012 --> 01:24:54,413
Commander von Roeder!
In the Duke’s name!

1148
01:24:58,686 --> 01:24:59,846
Now!

1149
01:24:59,988 --> 01:25:02,320
Don’t shoot!

1150
01:25:02,457 --> 01:25:04,721
He deserves it, Jews" lackey!

1151
01:25:04,859 --> 01:25:09,694
We don’t want a civil war, but if you
shoot now, it will be unavoidable.

1152
01:25:09,864 --> 01:25:14,824
On behalf of the Council,
I demand that you open the gate now!

1153
01:25:15,770 --> 01:25:17,829
Open the gate.

1154
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:56,204
Well, Oppenheimer? Sit down.
Whom were you looking for?

1155
01:25:56,344 --> 01:25:58,642
The Duke, Your Highness.

1156
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:00,611
Excuse me, Your Excellency.

1157
01:26:00,748 --> 01:26:03,012
I’m afraid he’s drunk too much.

1158
01:26:03,151 --> 01:26:07,918
Go look for him.
Tell him everyone is waiting for him.

1159
01:26:17,865 --> 01:26:21,266
It’s not serious, Süss.
I just don’t feel so well.

1160
01:26:21,436 --> 01:26:24,701
Get me a doctor.

1161
01:26:24,839 --> 01:26:26,670
Still no messenger.

1162
01:26:27,175 --> 01:26:29,905
- Tomorrow, Your Highness.
- When? When?

1163
01:26:30,044 --> 01:26:34,504
- Tomorrow morning at the latest.
- What’s that?

1164
01:26:34,649 --> 01:26:37,049
I thought he should be here
any minute now!

1165
01:26:37,919 --> 01:26:40,114
Just joking, Your Highness.

1166
01:26:40,255 --> 01:26:42,917
No more damn jokes!

1167
01:26:45,293 --> 01:26:48,319
I’m not up to them.

1168
01:26:48,496 --> 01:26:50,430
I don’t understand any of this.

1169
01:26:50,598 --> 01:26:52,498
I don’t know where they are.

1170
01:26:54,235 --> 01:26:58,137
I feel so weird.

1171
01:26:58,306 --> 01:27:06,008
I haven’t felt ill like this
since Peternardein.

1172
01:27:06,648 --> 01:27:07,546
Champagne!

1173
01:27:20,528 --> 01:27:26,433
This is the best medicine.
Anew glass!

1174
01:27:26,567 --> 01:27:29,092
To your health, Your Highness.

1175
01:27:30,538 --> 01:27:35,305
Why throw it away?
Throw it into your belly, Jew.

1176
01:27:35,443 --> 01:27:39,470
Wouldn’t it be better, Your Highness,
to join the ball?

1177
01:27:39,614 --> 01:27:49,615
Fireworks, rockets, lights, and women.
It’s always the same.

1178
01:27:49,757 --> 01:27:52,385
What is there behind
the whole mess?

1179
01:27:52,527 --> 01:27:53,858
What do you expect there to be?

1180
01:27:53,995 --> 01:27:57,123
Always the same, Süss.

1181
01:27:57,298 --> 01:28:01,132
Yes, I’ve seen people
in many different forms.

1182
01:28:01,302 --> 01:28:03,532
On the battlefield,

1183
01:28:03,671 --> 01:28:06,231
on the dance floor,

1184
01:28:06,374 --> 01:28:07,807
even in bed.

1185
01:28:07,942 --> 01:28:12,345
But today it seems to me
it’s always the same.

1186
01:28:14,982 --> 01:28:19,510
Why are you looking at me like that?
A physician’s gaze...

1187
01:28:19,654 --> 01:28:23,215
- What, me?
- Unmask yourself, my friend.

1188
01:28:23,358 --> 01:28:27,658
- What mask?
- The last one.

1189
01:28:27,795 --> 01:28:30,229
I wonder how you look.

1190
01:28:30,365 --> 01:28:32,492
How should I look?

1191
01:28:32,667 --> 01:28:40,438
A joke! If you dare make jokes with
me, you should appreciate mine, too.

1192
01:28:41,376 --> 01:28:44,937
- Couriers for the Duke.
- Let them in.

1193
01:28:45,079 --> 01:28:48,105
They don’t want to come up.

1194
01:28:50,852 --> 01:28:53,286
What is this?

1195
01:28:53,421 --> 01:28:54,979
My wig!

1196
01:29:02,597 --> 01:29:04,531
In the name of the Council,
Your Highness,

1197
01:29:04,665 --> 01:29:06,792
here are the demands of your people.

1198
01:29:06,968 --> 01:29:07,068
Demands? Demands! Who is
brazen enough to make demands?

1199
01:29:07,068 --> 01:29:12,700
Demands? Demands! Who is
brazen enough to make demands?

1200
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,774
- Alexander!
- Go away!

1201
01:29:14,909 --> 01:29:15,841
This isn’t for women!

1202
01:29:15,977 --> 01:29:17,239
Stop the music.

1203
01:29:17,378 --> 01:29:22,441
We know of your plans, Highness,
and the proposals of the Jew.

1204
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:24,881
That’s why we demand...

1205
01:29:25,019 --> 01:29:30,013
You demand? I think I’m the one
who should be making demands.

1206
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:32,217
- Nothing has changed, Highness!
- Not yet!

1207
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:35,625
The oath you took
for Württemberg still holds.

1208
01:29:35,797 --> 01:29:37,788
And we ask you,
do you want to keep this oath,

1209
01:29:37,965 --> 01:29:40,024
or does the Jew mean more to you
than your own people?

1210
01:29:40,201 --> 01:29:43,602
I myself choose my advisors!
No one else!

1211
01:29:43,771 --> 01:29:46,433
- Your advisor is a murderer!
- Lies!

1212
01:29:46,574 --> 01:29:48,303
He sent my wife to her death!

1213
01:29:48,443 --> 01:29:52,402
Slander! Sheer slander!

1214
01:29:52,713 --> 01:29:57,844
What, you dare to fight
in my noble presence?

1215
01:29:57,985 --> 01:30:05,323
I shall have you hanged, dogs,
hanged!

1216
01:30:06,994 --> 01:30:13,627
Alexander! Alexander!

1217
01:30:13,801 --> 01:30:16,861
Call a doctor!

1218
01:30:19,307 --> 01:30:25,007
Alexander! What are you doing?

1219
01:30:28,649 --> 01:30:30,844
He’s dead.

1220
01:30:33,788 --> 01:30:36,518
Stop, Mister Oppenheimer!

1221
01:30:38,259 --> 01:30:39,886
Following the Duke’s death,

1222
01:30:40,027 --> 01:30:43,554
the Council has authority
until a new Duke is chosen.

1223
01:30:43,731 --> 01:30:46,359
In the name of the Council,
I arrest you.

1224
01:30:48,469 --> 01:30:49,003
Sitting here is a wretched Jew who
for months brought nothing but lies.

1225
01:30:49,003 --> 01:30:58,241
Sitting here is a wretched Jew who
for months brought nothing but lies.

1226
01:30:58,913 --> 01:31:01,438
His whole policy rests
on a letter of the Duke’s

1227
01:31:01,582 --> 01:31:02,981
which releases him
of any responsibility.

1228
01:31:03,117 --> 01:31:04,778
The things you
have accused me of,

1229
01:31:04,919 --> 01:31:09,982
I only did upon the wish
and whim of my Duke!

1230
01:31:10,124 --> 01:31:13,252
The document says so.
You can read it clearly.

1231
01:31:13,394 --> 01:31:18,559
I was nothing more than
a true servant of my master!

1232
01:31:20,301 --> 01:31:24,601
Are you stating that letter
you swindled out of the Duke

1233
01:31:24,739 --> 01:31:28,800
can erase the list of your evil deeds?

1234
01:31:28,943 --> 01:31:32,606
We adjourn to consult.

1235
01:31:34,582 --> 01:31:38,575
Jew! This is the master blacksmith
speaking to you.

1236
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:40,914
Doesn’t that stir your conscience?

1237
01:31:41,055 --> 01:31:42,647
Leave him alone.

1238
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:48,729
You said you won’t be hanged higher
than our colleague Hans Bogner.

1239
01:31:48,896 --> 01:31:50,488
Silence. Wait for the sentence.

1240
01:31:50,665 --> 01:31:55,500
After a month of careful study,
we find the charges justified:

1241
01:31:55,636 --> 01:31:58,264
Blackmail, profiteering, corruption,

1242
01:31:58,406 --> 01:32:01,000
illicit sex, procuration,
and high treason.

1243
01:32:01,142 --> 01:32:05,078
But far greater seems the Jew’s guilt
of the scandals

1244
01:32:05,212 --> 01:32:09,979
that have brought so much
suffering upon our people.

1245
01:32:10,117 --> 01:32:16,647
Therefore, we shall listen to him
who has been most offended.

1246
01:32:16,791 --> 01:32:20,522
Gentlemen, I seek not revenge,
only punishment by law.

1247
01:32:20,661 --> 01:32:23,323
Speak freely, Sturm.
You suffered the most,

1248
01:32:23,497 --> 01:32:25,829
and yours is the right
to set things justly.

1249
01:32:25,967 --> 01:32:29,368
Suffering does not breed justice.

1250
01:32:29,537 --> 01:32:33,268
An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.

1251
01:32:33,407 --> 01:32:35,739
That is not our custom.

1252
01:32:35,876 --> 01:32:42,008
Our legal code states,
for all eternity:

1253
01:32:42,149 --> 01:32:49,146
"Whenever a Jew mingles
his flesh with a Christian woman...

1254
01:32:49,290 --> 01:32:52,793
He should be hanged at the gallows."

1255
01:32:53,394 --> 01:32:56,886
"Whenever a Jew mingles
his flesh with a Christian woman,

1256
01:32:57,064 --> 01:33:00,830
he should be hanged at the gallows,

1257
01:33:00,968 --> 01:33:06,167
as well-deserved punishment
and an example to the people."

1258
01:33:15,416 --> 01:33:21,412
I was nothing but a loyal servant
to my master!

1259
01:33:24,792 --> 01:33:30,492
How could I help it
if your Duke was a traitor?

1260
01:33:33,501 --> 01:33:35,298
I want to set everything right.

1261
01:33:35,436 --> 01:33:41,534
I swear it! Take my house,
take my money, but let me live!

1262
01:33:41,676 --> 01:33:44,839
I am not guilty!

1263
01:33:44,979 --> 01:33:46,913
I am only a poor Jew!

1264
01:33:47,048 --> 01:33:49,039
Give me my life!

1265
01:33:49,183 --> 01:33:52,949
I want to live! I want to live!

1266
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:14,435
I speak for the Council in the name
of the people of Württemberg.

1267
01:34:14,575 --> 01:34:18,636
All Jews must leave Württemberg
within three days.

1268
01:34:18,779 --> 01:34:21,976
No entry for Jews in the entire realm
of Württemberg.

1269
01:34:22,116 --> 01:34:28,112
Decreed in Stuttgart
on the 4th of February, 1738.

1270
01:34:28,255 --> 01:34:33,454
May our descendants
adhere to this decree,

1271
01:34:33,594 --> 01:34:39,032
and thereby be spared suffering
for their own well-being

1272
01:34:39,166 --> 01:34:43,068
and for the sake of their children
and their children’s children.

1273
01:34:43,604 --> 01:34:46,835
THE END
