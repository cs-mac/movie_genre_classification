00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,290
hate lies. Don't fucking lie to me.

7
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,130
Why would lie to you?

8
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,209
Yes? - Your documents please.

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,288
What do you want?

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,202
None of your business.

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,287
It's not here.

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,447
Don't behave like an idiot

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,249
in front of others.

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,561
Others? In this wilderness?

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,003
It all makes me want to puke!

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,809
You hit me?

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,525
Dumbfuck sack of shit!

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,881
Madam. - What?

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,442
Where are you coming from?

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,249
From a graveyard,

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,481
and we're going back to one!

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,442
Shut up. He's just asking.

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,726
Swear, she's made my life hell.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,001
She's shat on my life. - Speak calmly.

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,486
I'm talking to her, not to you.

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,806
He's crazy sir, ignore him.

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,883
Where are you coming from? - Tehran.

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,565
She's full of shit! She's lying!

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,926
Told you to shut up.

30
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,967
Never a straight word.

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,167
If she says it's day

32
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,765
you can be sure it's night.

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,802
Answer my question.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,525
He won't let me. Can't you see?

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,603
Answer you? You want to hear lies?

36
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,961
Try and speak calmly, please.

37
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,360
Do you want me to whisper?

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,482
Just ignore him.

39
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,721
This is how you've made me!

40
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,406
Don't scream fuckhead!

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,250
Look, she shattered my arm.

42
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,169
Take a breath, salute the prophet.

43
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,923
A breath?

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,651
She's been on my nerves for 500 km.

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,285
"She did this for us,

46
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,602
he did that for us." So what?

47
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,809
They did it for a reason.

48
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,803
They owed your parents.

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,286
You do the math officer.

50
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,680
It's a 500 km journey.

51
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,325
Your phone. - don't give a shit.

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,284
What if it's her? - Fuck her!

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,651
What are you doing? Psycho!

54
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,165
Because I'm a psycho!

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,484
You threw it in the snow.

56
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,287
I'm really sorry officer - Oh, eat shit!

57
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,370
Call the mobile so can find it.

58
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,006
So that stupid woman can bug me more?

59
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,641
Sir, can you call my mobile 0912?

60
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,847
Let me see your license first.

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,809
She doesn't have one.

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,161
It's not on me, Officer.

63
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,368
He has it, and he won't give it back.

64
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,724
You never had a driver's license!

65
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,160
Didn't ? - No, you didn't.

66
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,771
How come I've been driving

67
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,682
for 500 km?

68
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,042
My point exactly.

69
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,322
He has your license? - Yes.

70
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,521
Have it?

71
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,723
If have it; search me.

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,524
Get back in the car.

73
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,651
She says have it, right?

74
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,528
Then search me.

75
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,960
Stay where you are!

76
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,849
Here it is.

77
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,644
Get in the car, you clown.

78
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,805
Soheila, yes, we're doing it.

79
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,008
Sir, do your job.

80
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,969
Just shoot me.

81
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,851
Shoot me in the head

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,764
so can be free of her.

83
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,610
<i>I'll call you.</i>

84
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,687
Do you have a light?

85
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,082
What?

86
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,770
Matches, a lighter?

87
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,685
<i>Get in the car.</i>

88
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,530
Go get in the car.

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,923
Can't take it any more, Leila.

90
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,523
Can't stand you, or this life.

91
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,801
I'm staying here.

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,525
What's your problem brother?

93
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,200
His problem is money. - Money?

94
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,368
We're all a bunch of beggars.

95
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,368
Go get in the car

96
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,965
and stop blocking the road.

97
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,650
This is God's earth,

98
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,245
I'm God's subject.

99
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,805
Who's to say can't sit here?

100
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,724
This is a restricted area. Get up.

101
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,365
Wait a minute.

102
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,484
Wait. I'll fix it.

103
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,648
I'll fix his problem.

104
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,004
Here, divide this amongst yourselves.

105
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,123
What is this? - You think care?

106
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,731
I'll throw some myself.

107
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,561
What's this money?

108
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,321
Was this your problem?

109
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,486
Was this money fucking up your life?

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,240
Done! Let's go!

111
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,561
Take it buddy. Have fun.

112
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,566
It's legit.

113
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,926
Stop!

114
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,604

He was stumped.

146
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,847
Are they following us?

147
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,650
God no. They'll be counting

148
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,086
notes until midnight.

149
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,081
Did it record anything?

150
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,567
Must have. Where does it save the films?

151
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,765
The sunflower icon. - Here it is.

152
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,844
You were brilliant!

153
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,802
When you threw the mobile,

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,686
totally thought you'd lost your mind!

155
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,531
It felt right to throw it, so threw it.

156
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,526
But he was about to shoot.

157
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,488
No he wasn't.

158
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,762
Got scared. thought he'd shoot.

159
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,522
He has to give a warning first,

160
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,081
say something like 'Halt'.

161
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,728
The film isn't very good.

162
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,202
It looks alright. - We have to be in it.

163
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,970
You brag about 12 megapixels

164
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,007
and this is it?

165
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,122
Us not being in it

166
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,964
has nothing to do with pixels.

167
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,923
Is there a problem with clarity?

168
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,086
It's not clear, and we're not in it.

169
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,571
It's no use.

170
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,921
You can hear us,

171
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,970
and you can see the bags. It's fine.

172
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,003
I'm taking the bag, right here.

173
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,888
Took mine from the same place.

174
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,882
No, you took it from the other side.

175
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,769
You threw two bags, right?

176
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,408
Threw one. Or was it two?

177
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,129
Made sure to throw two.

178
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,482
Number 23 and 24.

179
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,408
No, we gave 23

180
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,130
to the rooster guy last night.

181
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,646
So threw 24 and 25?

182
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,603
So you must have thrown 26 and 27.

183
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,961
But 27 is still here.

184
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,645
It's a real mess back here.

185
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,841
Maybe we threw 3 bags.

186
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,842
2 for the soldiers

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,331
and 1 for the truck driver.

188
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,444
The driver had someone with him.

189
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,045
Was careful there'd be 4.

190
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,844
Right here, when we drive off,

191
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,809
you can see there are four bags.

192
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,286
We're cool.

193
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,085
Let me see...

194
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,885
They'll never come after us.

195
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,327
They'll have to report the money first.

196
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,046
What if we bump into them again?

197
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,440
It's charity.

198
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,965
It's helping the poor.

199
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,968
They might ask

200
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,849
why do it like crazy idiots.

201
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,331
Why not do it right?

202
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,522
Anyone who's unhappy can go complain

203
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,603
that we gave them money by force.

204
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,241
If we see them again,

205
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,765
they'll never mention it.

206
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,604
But we mustn't attract attention

207
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,647
among the locals.

208
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,165
They'll come after us like genies

209
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,287
with AK47s.

210
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,448
Genies don't carry guns.

211
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,362
Leila, this is on photo mode.

212
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,086
Down on the right,

213
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,288
there's a button for filming.

214
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,211
Got it? - think so.

215
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,722
Hello, Haji. - Hello. Welcome.

216
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,049
What's this?

217
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,406
Are you getting this?

218
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,327
Haji, sit right here.

219
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,489
Wave for the camera.

220
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,448
Is that OK?

221
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,329
Say thank you to the lady.

222
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,802
Say thanks, hope you get better soon.

223
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,521
May God heal all the sick.

224
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,648
Thank you Haji,

225
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,926
you've been very kind.

226
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,929
Miss, what's all this?

227
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,051
What's all what? - These.

228
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,120
Told you, it's a gift.

229
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,004
Gift? This is cash.

230
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,361
Yes, a gift of cash.

231
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,843
Are you from the Relief Center?

232
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,607
Where are we from?

233
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,728
Are we from the Relief Center?

234
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,725
No, we work for ourselves.

235
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,206
Don't need this.

236
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,487
You don't need it?

237
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,411
What earn here is enough.

238
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,886
Give this to someone needy.

239
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,802
Here we go again. You take it from here.

240
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,525
Hey Lady, where are you going?

241
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,003
Don't worry about others, OK?

242
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,481
We've brought enough for everyone.

243
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,728
Divide this between them as well,

244
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,003
so they get a bigger share.

245
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,362
Sir, you don't need to teach us

246
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,851
how to do our job.

247
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,846
There's a method to this.

248
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,888
See the numbers on the bags?

249
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,569
Yours is bag number 30.

250
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,728
You received, we filmed, you thanked.

251
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,967
If you give it back now

252
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,804
our books will get all messed up.

253
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,445
Kaveh what's this guy talking about?

254
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,563
Why are you getting angry?

255
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,444
Someone who's being charitable

256
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,647
doesn't get angry.

257
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,844
You don't return a gift, right?

258
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,601
You respect people's alms.

259
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,370
Just take the gift, say a prayer,

260
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,806
and enjoy yourself, right?

261
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,051
Am right?

262
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,691
Alright, don't want to offend you.

263
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,128
I'll take one of these as a keepsake.

264
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,607
That's enough for me.

265
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,281
What?

266
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,484
Offend me?

267
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,409
Why would be offended...

268
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,767
See? Now he's doing me a favor!

269
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,368
Look, can see you're not materialistic.

270
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,923
You're the spiritual type, right?

271
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,321
Fine, then spend the money

272
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,443
and change these plastic sheets.

273
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,522
They're filthy.

274
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,886
Fix the poles so they don't fall

275
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,281
on you if you fart.

276
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,326
What did you do that for?

277
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,767
You were lucky brought it down

278
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,644
a light breeze and you'd be done for.

279
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,161
What are you doing?

280
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,727
He doesn't want the money!

281
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,646
He's straight out of the Book of Saints.

282
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,480
Free cash is below him.

283
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,085
We'll find someone needy.

284
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:55,923
Where?

285
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,481
He's the only guy in this hellhole!

286
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,647
He's needy?

287
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,690
Why won't he take it then?

288
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,010
Why won't you take it?

289
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,884
Look, I'm really sorry.

290
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,485
Why are you sorry?

291
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,762
I'm giving alms to the poor,

292
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,046
Why apologize?

293
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,000
Take it, take it, needy prick!

294
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,041
Get in the car and stay there.

295
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,361
Move!

296
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,130
Apologize.

297
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,687
Can't help you because of my arm.

298
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,291
Sit for a minute.

299
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,925
Do you have a light?

300
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,726
I'm sorry if she upset you.

301
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,128
I'm not upset.

302
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,641
Don't know why she got angry.

303
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,769
Don't know what to do with her.

304
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,003
She's driving me crazy.

305
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,807
You'll be fine,

306
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,769
this kind of thing happens

307
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,285
to married couples.

308
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,161
She's my sister.

309
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,329
A sister is even closer than a wife.

310
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,526
They're after her.

311
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,729
She's committed a serious crime.

312
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,802
We're here to send her across the border

313
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,965
She drowned her baby
in my swimming pool.

314
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,162
Left the hospital at noon

315
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,441
with her one day old baby,

316
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,090
killed her before the day was out.

317
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,848
Then she broke my arm with a rod.

318
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,802
If her husband drops

319
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,086
the case for execution,

320
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,651
she'll end up in an asylum.

321
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,648
Which is worse.

322
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,801
Got all my money together

323
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,691
so could pay the traffickers.

324
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,282
Now it turns out

325
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,726
they take all your money

326
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,642
and abandon you

327
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,290
in the middle of nowhere.

328
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,090
So, with all this money,

329
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,049
we are in a lot of danger.

330
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,162
Without the money

331
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,606
we're just unlucky suckers

332
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,727
like everyone else.

333
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,651
We thought we'd give it away to people.

334
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,044
But we've been driving for 3 hours now,

335
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,725
the only person we've seen is you.

336
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,400
And you are so obstinate.

337
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,686
If you'd taken the money,

338
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,762
we'd be on our way.

339
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,967
It's not that simple.

340
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,609
It's a big responsibility.

341
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,521
OK then.

342
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,368
Leave these with you for safekeeping.

343
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,403
Leave the money here, cross over,

344
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,410
deliver her to friends,

345
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,925
and return tonight.

346
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,009
Tonight, I'll take all of it back, OK?

347
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,803
Don't say no. I'm in a bind.

348
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,930
How am supposed to look

349
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,491
after all this money?

350
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,089
You tell me what to do.

351
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,807
Take this Qoran with you.

352
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,649
Come back quickly.

353
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,444
I'll be waiting!

354
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,161
Done.

355
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,162
Hey, you have customers.

356
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,169
They're city types!

357
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,287
How do you do this?

358
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,042
There's a trick to it.

359
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,922
What's the trick?

360
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,322
I'm the trick.

361
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,721
What if you're not around?

362
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,441
I'll always be around, don't worry.

363
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,482
Give it to me.

364
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,244
Want to do it myself.

365
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,965
You can't, give it to me.

366
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,280
Welcome.

367
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,966
Should we call her?

368
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,686
You do it, I'm not in the mood.

369
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,247
She'll call herself.

370
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,885
Then you'll have to talk to her

371
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,166
and she'll piss you off.

372
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,281
What do you have?

373
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,641
Only offal today.

374
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,404
Bring whatever you have.

375
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,884
Dude, can you score Hash here?

376
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,445
What do you want Hash for?

377
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,761
Want to smoke some.

378
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,880
No we don't have that
kind of thing here.

379
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,685
How do you make ends meet, then?

380
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,807
With tea and waterpipes?

381
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,525
We have offal, too.

382
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,761
Trying to sound like a tough guy?

383
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,927
Want to smoke hash,

384
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,047
is there a problem?

385
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,686
What did the old man say

386
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,251
to make you such a shit now?

387
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,602
Nothing. I'm a shit by birth.

388
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,082
Organically, right from the word go.

389
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,407
Do you want yogurt?

390
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,202
Yes.

391
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,686
This guy's out of control.

392
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,080
You should talk to him.

393
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,442
We're not in Tehran.

394
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,601
He was just kidding.

395
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,006
Whatever. You won't see

396
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,162
another coffeehouse for miles around.

397
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,486
Either the owner has fled

398
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,641
for fear of his life,

399
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,446
or he got involved in this type of filth

400
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,961
and they closed him down.

401
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,764
He was wrong, shouldn't have said that.

402
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,086
Have a seat, kids.

403
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,651
Look at the twigs.

404
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,405
We looked everywhere,

405
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,849
here it was, right under our noses.

406
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,041
Guess where found them?

407
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,326
Near the old man's shack.

408
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,246
Small world, eh?

409
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,886
So you take these for your uncle?

410
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,527
Our uncle's car has broken down,

411
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,326
he can't take our gas capsule to refill.

412
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,403
How much do you charge for each load?

413
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,130
We don't sell these.

414
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,325
You burn this wood?

415
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,967
Do you know the wood you burn

416
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,963
can save human lives?

417
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,847
This is medicine.

418
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,889
Do you know what medicine is?

419
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,370
What do you want here?

420
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,331
An ashtray.

421
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,125
There are some inside.

422
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,645
There weren't any.

423
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,882
Will you take it in?

424
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,122
Want to use the toilet. Is it this way?

425
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,761
It's a bit muddy.

426
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,407
There's mud everywhere.

427
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,126
Give that to the kids,

428
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,850
make another one for us.

429
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,890
And don't charge me for it.

430
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,562
They have money now, they can pay.

431
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,251
Miss! You left your bag.

432
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,246
It's not mine.

433
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,122
It's full of bank notes.

434
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,450
It's a lot of money.

435
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,608
And who's that guy, your husband,

436
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,161
or boyfriend, he's distributing money.

437
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,408
Is it alms or something?

438
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,961
Yeah.

439
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,011
God bless. - Thanks.

440
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,164
Is this all mine now?

441
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,001
My husband will probably

442
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,525
give some to the others too.

443
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,404
So he's your husband?

444
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,080
Is he your husband or a husband?

445
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,125
Bet this money, you're not his wife.

446
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,046
So what if I'm not?

447
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,364
He's not your type.

448
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,328
He's your guide, right?

449
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,009
He was here with someone
else last month,

450
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,808
to take them across.

451
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,124
If you want to cross, can take you.

452
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,090
Told you, we're giving gifts,

453
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,287
you have it in your hand.

454
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,726
Don't trust just anyone.

455
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,083
You're from the city, you're loaded.

456
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,850
They'll take your money

457
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,411
and dump you somewhere.

458
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,164
Then there's the border guards.

459
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,685
They have their own system.

460
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,569
You need someone who knows the ways.

461
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,809
The guy you're with is a bullshitter.

462
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,525
We have no money left,

463
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,205
we gave it all away.

464
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,521
Don't be fooled by his looks.

465
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,803
He'll steal your car in a heartbeat.

466
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,240
Then you'll have to come

467
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,368
and be a guest at my house tonight!

468
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,083
But you won't come, will you?

469
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,806
Look,

470
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,965
they just arrived last night,

471
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,841
latest fashion.

472
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,690
There's no need, it was a gift.

473
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,970
Wear it to a party one night,

474
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,401
back in Tehran, and think of me...

475
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,724
That guy... That place...

476
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,931
What's this you're wearing?

477
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,890
You'll look pretty in this.

478
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,286
Prettier!

479
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,007
Thanks a lot.

480
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,166
And your car has lots

481
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,481
of takers around here.

482
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,368
It's a honey.

483
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,005
Just like yourself.

484
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,322
5 million in each bag.

485
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,686
Times 4, that's how much?

486
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,648
4 times 5, is 20.

487
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,842
And how many bags do you have?

488
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,008
Have one. - Altogether how many?

489
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,123
Can say? - No, let him say.

490
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,765
4 plus 1 comes to what?

491
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:51,843
7.

492
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,447
Good boy.

493
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,367
Take another prize.

494
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,328
No, it comes to 5.

495
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,209
Shut up and mind your own business.

496
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,084
So what does it add up to now?

497
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,287
7.

498
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,611
You're so clever.

499
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,250
No, it comes to 6.

500
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,363
No, he's right, it's 7.

501
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,728
Don't listen to him,

502
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,847
he doesn't know anything.

503
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,762
Here's your prize.

504
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,722
But it comes to 6. - Do a count.

505
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,767
See? - It's 7 now.

506
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,531
If you talk too much,
I'll take them back.

507
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,643
Off you go. Run along.

508
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,601
You are a troubled person.

509
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,410
It was a pothole, can't you see?

510
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,804
Why can't we get rid of this cash?

511
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,883
That pile looks the same as before.

512
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,003
There were 200 bags, only 32 have gone.

513
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,531
In two days.

514
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,011
A day and a half. 32 divided by 2 is?

515
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,167
16.

516
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,970
Let's say 20. At this rate we have to

517
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,360
keep going for another 8 days.

518
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,322
8 and a half.

519
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,167
You should have given

520
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,482
the coffeehouse owner's bag to that guy.

521
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,365
We said one bag for each person.

522
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,848
It's still pretty good we unloaded 3.

523
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,409
8. One for the guy, 7 for the kids.

524
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,445
You gave the kids 7 bags?

525
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,362
Why?

526
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,565
What does this mean?

527
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,603
Felt like being extra charitable.

528
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,688
The deal was one bag per person.

529
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,330
That was my judgment.

530
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,762
Was putting 100 kilos

531
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,887
of firewood on the roof

532
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,882
also your judgment?

533
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,844
Waited for an hour for you outside

534
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,842
the coffeehouse.

535
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,405
Was bored. What's the big deal?

536
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,402
The Wood's up there.

537
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,800
It can breathe the fresh air.

538
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,649
You could've dumped them

539
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,881
when got back. bought them.

540
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,882
You can't dump something

541
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,689
you've just bought.

542
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,370
The kids don't need such games.

543
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,447
You say hello, how are you,

544
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,011
take this money go give it to your mom.

545
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,571
You take the photo and it's done.

546
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,603
You can't buy stuff from someone

547
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,091
and then throw it away

548
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,207
in front of them.

549
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,482
Why not?

550
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,091
They'll think you're a moron.

551
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,850
It's like walking into a gas station,

552
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,729
putting your ration card in the machine

553
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,081
and telling the guy

554
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,402
to pour 60 liters on the ground.

555
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,804
He'll think you're a moron.

556
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,486
No, he'll discover that you're a moron.

557
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,808
First of all, those kids explained

558
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,564
that it's cold up there,

559
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,046
they burn the twigs

560
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,089
so they don't die of cold.

561
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,850
Secondly, so what if

562
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,241
they think you're a moron?

563
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,082
They're just kids.

564
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,361
Didn't that border guard

565
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,362
think you're a moron

566
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,010
for throwing 20 million at him?

567
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,042
That was different.

568
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,326
What's the difference?

569
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,646
These were kids.

570
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,121
So you were worried that

571
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,886
they'd grow up traumatized

572
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,082
because you gave them

573
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,890
money for nothing?

574
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,048
No, I'm serious,

575
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,122
were you trying not

576
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,486
to hurt their feelings?

577
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,284
Didn't want to confuse them.

578
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,490
These kid are confused by birth!

579
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,730
If they dodge the bombs,

580
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,370
and not step on mines,

581
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,289
they'll be shepherds, or cowherds...

582
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,842
'Confused' cowherds at most, so what?

583
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,843
Look, I'm hungry.

584
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,127
Help me understand,

585
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,963
then we'll have lunch.

586
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,769
Understand what?

587
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,331
What are you obsessing about now?

588
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,720
Want to know why

589
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,769
there is 100 kg of twigs

590
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,842
on my roof.

591
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,927
I'm sorry, pull aside

592
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,047
and I'll take them off

593
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,008
so you can relax.

594
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,406
Am relaxed.

595
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,806
They can stay there

596
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,530
for another 100 years.

597
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,403
Want to know why

598
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,288
you put them there

599
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,202
in the first place.

600
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,084
I'm not worried about the car,

601
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,561
want to know what's
going on in your brain.

602
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,051
There's nothing in my brain

603
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,651
because my brain is hungry,

604
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,245
and the offal is now cold.

605
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,330
No, there's a difference in your brain

606
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,050
between that old man

607
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,571
who had to take all my crap,

608
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,449
and the kids you treated so well.

609
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,086
Yes there is a difference. - And?

610
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,691
One person may

611
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,002
have been a contender

612
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,441
before a bomb exploded

613
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,204
his life to bits

614
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,561
another one might have

615
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,846
always been a leach,

616
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,809
a liar, a beggar, don't know.

617
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,445
And you judge blind

618
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,524
who deserves better and who doesn't?

619
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,041
So the deal that we give one bag

620
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,441
to each person in need is off?

621
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,562
Now you say

622
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,961
we should assess the needy.

623
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,928
So the oppressed

624
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,002
of the world can come

625
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,321
and sit a test of merit.

626
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,568
And if they fail your TOEFL of misery,

627
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,165
we can just shit on them?

628
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,567
Turn around, I'll find those kids,

629
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,881
take my money back,

630
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,485
and shove the twigs...

631
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,049
Shit, her morphine's worn off again.

632
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,687
Hi Mom!

633
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,765
Wait, have no reception.

634
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,490
Can't hear you, wait a minute.

635
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,805
Don't understand what you're saying.

636
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,162
Let me find a good spot.

637
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,760
Everything is OK here.

638
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,971
Same as California, but with snow.

639
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,128
What signatures?

640
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,408
You said either film or photographs.

641
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,564
Now suddenly you want signatures?

642
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,444
Internet in this hellhole?

643
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,967
Do you know where am right now?

644
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,442
There's nobody here.

645
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,287
What you saw on TV has changed now.

646
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,930
People were still around then.

647
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,286
They've disappeared down

648
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,407
some shithole now.

649
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,083
Wait a minute.

650
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,570
I'll call you, have to go now.

651
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,964
Kaveh this guy has what we want.

652
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,681
What is it we want? - Beverages.

653
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,644
It's someone ease’s order.

654
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,881
What are we buying exactly?

655
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,962
We're good customers.

656
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,610
I've already sold this load.

657
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,402
My mule slipped and fell down.

658
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,651
Where are you?

659
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,609
I'm close to the graveyard.

660
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,482
Honk your horn

661
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,290
so can tell how far you are.

662
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,166
You're far off. Drive fast.

663
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,646
What about the mule?

664
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,450
Have to finish her off.

665
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,482
Why?

666
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,011
When a horse breaks a leg,

667
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,763
they shoot it,

668
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,001
in order to kill it.

669
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,124
Hey, I'm the vet here,

670
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,329
and it's a mule, not a horse.

671
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,329
Same thing. It's over for her.

672
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,045
Undo her packsaddle.

673
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,690
Smuggling booze is not my real job.

674
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,847
My land never yielded

675
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,081
after the rocket attack.

676
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,282
Sir, asked you to undo her packsaddle.

677
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,687
What for? She's finished.

678
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,847
Are you a vet or what?

679
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,642
Put the gun away and come here.

680
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,921
It's not her stomach,

681
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,922
her leg's broken.

682
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,081
She's pregnant.

683
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,769
Stop fooling around Miss,

684
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,251
let me do my job.

685
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,488
I'm telling you,

686
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,527
she's pregnant.

687
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,642
She's a mule.

688
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,729
She's 11 weeks gone.

689
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,722
She must have been

690
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,881
at it behind your back!

691
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,162
It's moving.

692
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,165
Kaveh come and touch, it's kicking.

693
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,731
Mules don't get pregnant.

694
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,484
So what's this kicking in here?

695
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,085
How do know? A fart?

696
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,841
This lady is a vet.

697
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,525
She knows the difference.

698
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,250
Her leg's broken.
have to finish her off.

699
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,851
Kill her off for a broken leg?

700
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,411
This guy's arm's broken too,

701
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,443
should finish him off as well?

702
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,965
You bind a broken leg.

703
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,082
No big deal.

704
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,002
It would be great

705
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,002
if it could be fixed

706
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,571
with a scarf, but it's broken.

707
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,807
This is my job, you know.

708
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,082
Listen to what the doctor says.

709
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,281
Even if you bind it,

710
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,851
she won't be able to walk.

711
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,166
She'll be stuck here tonight

712
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,207
and freeze to death.

713
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,888
You just want to kill her so you can go.

714
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,769
This mule and have walked

715
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,684
these mountains for years.

716
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,247
She's like a friend, and she's in pain.

717
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,490
And I'm asking you to sell her to me.

718
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,409
She just keeps at it no matter what say.

719
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,204
I'll pay for the foal as well

720
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,328
so you'll believe she's pregnant.

721
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,206
Name your price.

722
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,608
It depends. don't know.

723
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,849
How much is a foal?

724
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,122
Wouldn't sell a foal.

725
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,650
The profit's in selling it as an adult.

726
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,604
Told you these scumbags are greedy.

727
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,001
He was whining a minute ago,

728
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,366
now he's playing hardball.

729
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,608
It's not the way you put it.

730
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,207
It's always the way

731
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,088
YOU guys put it.

732
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,282
Let's go.

733
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,607
Ignore him.

734
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,687
I'll buy the foal

735
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,285
the same price as an adult.

736
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,971
Don't know...

737
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,604
Who knows what'll happen?

738
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,086
What if the foal is lame,

739
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,162
or blind, or twins?

740
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,685
It's an unknown quantity.

741
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,247
What if God doesn't want

742
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,049
this beast dead,

743
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,440
and she gets up and walks?

744
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,044
These people won't deal with you

745
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,565
until you show them cash.

746
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,886
Take it!

747
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,762
This is too much. - Don't worry.

748
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,445
I'll take everything.

749
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,046
The foal, the mule,

750
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,884
the whisky and the gun.

751
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,320
Why the gun?

752
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,681
You want to take our cash,

753
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,285
come back and finish her off?

754
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,360
Give me the gun.

755
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,451
What's this?

756
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,364
It gets cold here at night.

757
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,766
Why didn't you bring it all?

758
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,569
If they arrest us

759
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,881
it's smuggling, one bottle

760
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,280
is for personal use,

761
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,481
only 80 lashes.

762
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,524
The bastard was going to come back

763
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,647
and shoot the mule.

764
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,561
Why are we still here?

765
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,842
Let's wait until he's far away.

766
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,688
He took his money and he's gone.

767
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,567
Is the sound really loud?

768
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,524
Will he hear the shot?

769
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,566
You have to finish off the mule.

770
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,167
He was right,

771
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,560
she won't last the night.

772
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,324
But you said she'd get better.

773
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,884
He was about to do it himself,

774
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,371
why didn't you let him?

775
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,365
How would we give him the money then?

776
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,088
We were supposed to buy the mule,

777
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,730
pay and leave.

778
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,528
He'd go back and finish her off.

779
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,121
But then you decided

780
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,691
to take his gun as well.

781
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,930
You want me to shoot with this hand?

782
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,606
Do it with your other hand.

783
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,241
You want me to kill the mule?

784
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,160
She'll die eventually anyway.

785
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,404
Maybe she'll get better.

786
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,688
Did he see me?

787
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,243
He'll never find it.

788
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,521
Were you digging a grave?

789
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,364
You said he shouldn't find it quickly.

790
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,601
Not my fault he's decided

791
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,921
to dig on the other side.

792
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,046
This is stupid, why not just say:

793
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,611
"Here is some money. It's yours."

794
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,602
You saw what happened

795
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,966
when we did that yesterday.

796
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,328
They stare at you, then walk off.

797
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,966
Let's go where people are still living,

798
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,207
put a bag at the door,

799
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,407
ring the bell, hide.

800
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,601
When they find it,

801
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,285
we take a picture and go.

802
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,484
Why ring the bell?

803
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,488
It's quicker.

804
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,404
We won't have to hang around.

805
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,767
They'll think it's lost,
and try to find the owner.

806
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,648
Bullshit.

807
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,166
1 in a million chance.

808
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,930
If it's considered chance.

809
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,521
If you don't ring, they'll think

810
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,887
someone's lost the money

811
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,890
and start putting notices around:

812
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,280
"Money found".

813
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,891
Like they do outside shops.

814
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,525
Why do you think everyone's

815
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,806
as crazy as you are?

816
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,320
Imagine you're walking

817
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,891
around downtown Tehran,

818
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,525
and two weirdies come over

819
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,886
with a bag of money.

820
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,970
You wouldn't take it, would you?

821
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,089
It's different

822
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,687
when you ring someone's bell.

823
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,449
He really went out of his way

824
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,648
to find the owners, didn't he?

825
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,245
Let's go. don't want to spend

826
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,640
another night in the car.

827
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,286
Sir...

828
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,160
Sir...

829
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,523
Have you seen a bag around here?

830
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,323
Hi.

831
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,285
Have you seen a plastic bag this size?

832
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,930
No Miss.

833
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,122
Left it around here near a rock.

834
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,008
No rocks here.

835
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:03,922
They put the gravel

836
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,570
down here a long time ago.

837
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,245
Was here this morning,

838
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,765
there was no gravel.

839
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,725
It's a few days now.

840
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,965
What's he saying?

841
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,361
He says the gravel's

842
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,124
been here for a few days.

843
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,482
If it was, he wouldn't be able to dig.

844
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,527
It'd be frozen.

845
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,243
The sun melts the ice on top

846
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,561
in the mornings.

847
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,570
But underneath, it's frozen hard.

848
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,801
Have a look.

849
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,684
Didn't say you took it.

850
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,521
There were no rocks here, it was frozen.

851
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,288
He's not so stupid to admit

852
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,522
he's seen all that money.

853
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,881
I'm a guard here,

854
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,168
look after people's property.

855
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,970
If I'd seen anything would tell you.

856
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,009
Listen, we're taking our child over

857
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,241
the border for surgery.

858
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,805
He's in the car right now.

859
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,241
It's his hospital money.

860
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,962
We were driving past,

861
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,406
stopped to wash my hands,

862
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,806
they dropped a bomb or something,

863
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,325
got scared and let': the bag behind.

864
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,402
If don't find the bag

865
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,891
my child will die right here.

866
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,927
May God heal your child.

867
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,690
Would pay for him myself

868
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,443
if could.

869
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,971
If I'd seen any money,

870
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:09,962
would say so.

871
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,007
I'm not lying.

872
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,123
Is this where you sleep?

873
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,442
Yes.

874
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,529
Do you mind if have a look inside?

875
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,322
What for? - Nothing, just a quick look.

876
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,727
There's someone in there. - What?

877
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,609
There's family in there.

878
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,643
You have a wife and kids here?

879
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,285
He's lying, what family?

880
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,605
Don't go in,

881
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,241
my wife's inside.

882
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,965
Just want to have a look.

883
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,083
Can go where your wife is, right?

884
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,204
He's lying, there's no one in there.

885
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,410
Miss, Miss, Hello.

886
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,931
Is your wife deaf?

887
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,411
You've scared her.

888
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,250
Who are you trying to fool?

889
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,401
He's not lying.

890
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,487
Won't bother her.

891
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,880
Just want to see her.

892
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,680
Said no.

893
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,561
What's your problem?

894
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,446
Told you not to go in.

895
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,761
Leave it Kaveh, let's go.

896
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,885
You started it. You finish it.

897
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,451
Go inside. Ignore him!

898
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,648
Our child is dying in the car.

899
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,930
Why hide such a pretty
girl in this tent?

900
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,646
Take her somewhere better,

901
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,006
now that you have money.

902
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,685
Are you in pain?

903
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,326
It's nothing.

904
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,002
Do you want an Advil?

905
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,486
No use.

906
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,608
Let's get rid of the rest and get back.

907
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,647
I'm suffocating.

908
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,770
Can't wait.

909
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,169
Slow down. The truck.

910
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,801
Turn around.

911
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,047
It won't stop.

912
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,884
Said turn around!

913
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,001
Hurry!

914
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,443
Use your beamer.

915
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,969
Pull aside. - What for?

916
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,366
Just do it, OK?

917
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,249
Don't act crazy again.

918
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,801
Stay in the car if you can't take it.

919
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,287
Where are you running to?

920
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,011
Get down.

921
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,041
Do you have any ID? - What?

922
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,446
ID. Identification!

923
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,408
What for?

924
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,801
Have to deliver this load, I'm late.

925
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,161
Don't care if you're late,

926
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,321
need to see your ID.

927
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,726
We're not Afghans,

928
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,086
we're from here.

929
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,964
Have a license to drive a truck.

930
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,360
I've done nothing wrong.

931
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,603
Swear on my mother's grave...

932
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,569
Get down here for a minute.

933
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,002
Haven't got my papers on me.

934
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,169
What? - My license is in the camp.

935
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,809
Have to deliver this lime. - Camp?

936
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,490
It's in my tent in the camp.

937
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,404
You're driving a truck

938
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,210
without your license?

939
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,128
If they arrest you in this mess

940
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,008
how will you prove anything?

941
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,804
What's there to prove?

942
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,683
He's my brother,

943
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,569
everyone knows us along this route.

944
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,444
We've been working here for 3 years.

945
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,801
Why do you keep on about work?

946
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,961
Can see you work here.

947
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,685
Want to know who you are.

948
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,211
I'm Morteza Kerendi.

949
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,767
I've been working here 3 years.

950
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,648
Know you're Morteza Kerendi.

951
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,842
And this is your brother, right?

952
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,001
Yes sir.

953
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:50,046
We've been looking for you for a week.

954
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,885
Why? go to work all day.

955
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,527
I've never even hurt an ant.

956
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:02,444
I've asked everyone your whereabouts.

957
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,450
You've no phone, no address...

958
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,130
even asked the police,

959
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,123
no one knows where you are.

960
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,521
Miss Radmanesh, we found him.

961
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,924
Bring the receipt forms.

962
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,491
Receipt for what?

963
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,086
You're a winner my friend.

964
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,287
You've hit Jackpot!

965
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,085
Won what?

966
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,126
Bring the money too.

967
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,449
Won what?

968
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,927
I'll tell you in a minute.

969
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,130
What did you tell them?

970
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,124
She's my colleague.

971
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,890
This is ten million. Two fives.

972
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,804
Sit and count it at your leisure.

973
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,411
This money is all mine?

974
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,567
And sign this receipt.

975
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,961
What's wrong with you?

976
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,121
Sign the receipt.

977
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,526
What's this for?

978
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,960
There was a lottery in Tehran.

979
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,201
Your name was pulled out.

980
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,043
Can take it back

981
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,087
if you don't want it.

982
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,241
Do you have a bag?

983
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,925
The plastic tears easily.

984
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,248
There's a sack in the cabin.

985
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,047
What lottery?

986
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,321
You can't trust

987
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,562
your own brother with money.

988
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,087
This one is making plans already.

989
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,287
Thanks a lot.

990
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,370
My duty to say.

991
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,320
Now he can get married.

992
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,766
Is he such an idiot?

993
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,689
He's been engaged for four months.

994
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,046
He was stuck for money.

995
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,121
You're engaged? - Yes.

996
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,720
What's her name?

997
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,651
Sepideh. Miss Sepideh.

998
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,406
Is she pretty?

999
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,561
Oh, for god's sake...

1000
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,767
I'm just asking.

1001
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:45,808
If she isn't,

1002
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,610
don't waste the money on her.

1003
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,569
Wait, you'll find someone better.

1004
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,967
Is she any good?

1005
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,721
She's good.

1006
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,087
It took him a year

1007
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,571
to persuade her father.

1008
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,161
Wish you all the best.

1009
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,530
It's the beginning of his end!

1010
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,529
Come to the site with us

1011
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,045
for a cup of tea.

1012
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,686
It's just 5 minutes down the road.

1013
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,524
The road's a bit muddy,

1014
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,681
but it's near.

1015
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,325
You want to go to work?

1016
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,569
I'll be careful with the money.

1017
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,240
I'll put it under my
seat, it'll be safe.

1018
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,965
Don't care where you put it,e

1019
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,202
I'm asking if you're going to work now?

1020
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,967
We're workers.

1021
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,686
Just gave you 10 million cash.

1022
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,968
Looked for you in
all the holes on this road.

1023
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,121
The boss has been waiting

1024
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,361
for this load for 2 days

1025
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,648
Fuck the boss!
You're the jewel in his crown!

1026
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,723
There's a shortage of trucks.

1027
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,762
The project has to end

1028
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,728
by the end of the...

1029
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,041
Give it back.

1030
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,568
You want the money?

1031
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,044
Give it to me or I'll call the cops.

1032
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,401
Kaveh?

1033
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,327
What did say?

1034
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,925
You work, you have a salary.

1035
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,206
You don't need money.

1036
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,243
Why? He didn't say anything.

1037
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,363
You mind your own business.

1038
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,726
You want to go to work

1039
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,167
and you have no ID.

1040
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,044
Do, have a birth certificate.

1041
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,087
It's in the camp.

1042
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,446
You tell him Mostafa...

1043
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,801
What good is that to me?

1044
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,371
Want to know who you are.

1045
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,483
Been looking in this shithole

1046
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,371
for a week asking for Morteza Kerendi.

1047
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,802
Was it Morteza or Mostafa?

1048
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,122
Morteza.

1049
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,367
What?

1050
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,887
Mostafa.

1051
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,849
Everyone tells a different story,

1052
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,367
he's gone to Toutsari, Ghaderabad,

1053
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,646
gone away...

1054
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,524
I'm Mostafa.

1055
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:42,962
I'm Mostafa.

1056
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,522
Do you want Morteza or Mostafa?

1057
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,883
Mostafa Kerendi.

1058
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,771
You said Morteza.

1059
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,202
Are you Mostafa or Morteza?

1060
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,282
I'm Morteza.

1061
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,290
Are you going to work too?

1062
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,930
No, swear I won't.

1063
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,851
Give him the money.

1064
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,723
But you said Morteza.

1065
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,331
What's the difference?

1066
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,084
My money is your money.

1067
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,001
No it isn't. Come here.

1068
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,923
Where there's a Qoran,

1069
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,162
there's no need for ID.

1070
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,566
Swear you won't give any

1071
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,290
of the money to your brother.

1072
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,280
Can't, he's my brother.

1073
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,086
Swear Mostafa.

1074
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,968
Put your hand on the book

1075
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,690
and repeat after me:

1076
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,964
What should say?

1077
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,401
Swear on this Qoran...

1078
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,890
won't give any of this money...

1079
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,808
Under any circumstances... - What?

1080
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,082
Under any circumstances...

1081
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,527
'to my brother Morteza Kerendi.

1082
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,842
Louder!

1083
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,161
Done.

1084
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,283
You're not going to work are you?

1085
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,484
No, swear to God I'm not! - God bless.

1086
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,442
What will you do with that load?

1087
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,643
Are you going to deliver it? - No.

1088
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,041
Dump it.

1089
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,048
What?

1090
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:31,968
Where?

1091
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,403
Don't care. Just be quick, I'm late.

1092
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,691
You're going the wrong way.

1093
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,761
You're going back to the coffeehouse.

1094
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,728
I'm talking to you,

1095
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,847
you're going back to Tehran.

1096
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:13,967
Know where I'm going.

1097
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,451
You want to go back to Tehran?

1098
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,567
Yes.

1099
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,841
We're running out of gas,

1100
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,525
where do you think you're going?

1101
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,851
What about these?

1102
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,281
What does this mean?

1103
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,960
We go back and say we failed. We failed!

1104
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,403
You forget why we came here.

1105
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,489
How will we go on living? - We won't.

1106
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,611
If you can take from one man

1107
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,841
and give to another,

1108
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,769
can say I'm tired and I'm going back.

1109
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,849
There were two of them threw

1110
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,764
two bags, what's the big deal?

1111
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,682
Stop being a jerk! You just took away

1112
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,251
10 million from some guy.

1113
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,522
You took it away!

1114
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,563
Took my own money, not his.

1115
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,165
You saw what he said.

1116
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,481
He said he wanted to go to work.

1117
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,404
Everyone goes to work.

1118
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,408
Fuck his work!

1119
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,524
You're here to deliver and leave,

1120
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,648
their lives are not your business.

1121
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:05,887
He didn't get it!

1122
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,565
He wanted to be a slave!

1123
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,171
And now he's got it?

1124
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,841
Pull aside.

1125
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,280
Answer my question!

1126
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,684
Pull aside or I'll smash your face in.

1127
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:17,648
No won't.

1128
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,928
Thank you very much, I'll get off here.

1129
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,930
Get out, I'm driving.

1130
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,531
What's the matter with you?

1131
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,208
You can't drive with that arm.

1132
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,686
Is that your child?

1133
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,851
My daughter.

1134
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,927
The ground's frozen solid, isn't it?

1135
01:02:59,080 --> 01:02:59,967
That's right.

1136
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,090
Was she your only child?

1137
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,487
What?

1138
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,286
Did you only have the one?

1139
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,729
No, have three sons.

1140
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,250
Asked god for a daughter,

1141
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,128
he gave her

1142
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,611
and took her the next day.

1143
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,649
She was only a day old?

1144
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,481
But it's better when they go early, no?

1145
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,240
When they get older,

1146
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,687
you get used to them; it's harder.

1147
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,766
God rest her soul.

1148
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,642
This way you can go make another one.

1149
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,962
What are you doing exactly?

1150
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,802
You can't dig this soil, it's frozen.

1151
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,809
Have to bury her.

1152
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,843
Sure, in the right conditions.

1153
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,010
The ground is rock hard right now.

1154
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:42,084
We bury them for our own benefit.

1155
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,760
Makes no difference to the dead.

1156
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,003
What is it? understand;

1157
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,730
she was your daughter.

1158
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,481
But she is no more. Gone.

1159
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,451
Dead. Who knows where she is now?

1160
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,564
This corpse isn't your kid,

1161
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:02,881
it's 2kg of meat.

1162
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,206
Let's say you dig a hole

1163
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,964
and bury these four bits of meat

1164
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,726
so you won't see her disintergrate.

1165
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,721
A corpse eaten by worms

1166
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,486
is a hundred times worse

1167
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,161
than one eaten by wolves.

1168
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,371
If you don't want to see her,

1169
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,487
just leave her here

1170
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:24,920
in 30 minutes the dogs

1171
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,730
won't even leave the bones.

1172
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,481
She doesn't care if she's eaten

1173
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,085
by worms or wolves.

1174
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:35,411
And what about the wolves?

1175
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,727
Should they starve

1176
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,848
in the cold because she's your kid?

1177
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,280
Leave it for them,

1178
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,283
it's just a tiny morsel.

1179
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,845
Do you know what you're saying?

1180
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:44,683
I'm going to...

1181
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,848
Stop right there!

1182
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,610
It's God's earth and I'm God's subject,

1183
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,125
feel like sitting right here.

1184
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,689
You don't want to talk,

1185
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,888
fine, why pick a fight?

1186
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,411
Go dig your hole.

1187
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,369
Dig till you drop dead.

1188
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:06,206
I'm burying my daughter. - Bury her.

1189
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,368
If digging was possible

1190
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:11,251
you'd have reached oil by now.

1191
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,563
YOU People!

1192
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,289
How many kids

1193
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,169
did you say you have? - Three.

1194
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,126
With your wife, you're five.

1195
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,451
Do you make enough?

1196
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,367
Do you have enough to eat?

1197
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,121
What does that mean?

1198
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,567
You either have enough or you don't.

1199
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,007
What do you do? - I'm a teacher.

1200
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,730
I'll pay you for that?

1201
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,931
Pay for what?

1202
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,447
The corpse.

1203
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,691
I'll buy it.

1204
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,686
Mean well.

1205
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:57,441
Just say the price.

1206
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,360
1 million current notes of the country.

1207
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:11,321
That makes 333,000 per kilo...

1208
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,966
don't know, don't have scales with me.

1209
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,642
How much does meat cost these days?

1210
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,807
What? Count it.

1211
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,201
I'm giving you 1 million

1212
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,566
so you won't have to dig any more.

1213
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,051
That's not a bad thing.

1214
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,247
Easy legit money.

1215
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,851
You want more?

1216
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,451
Just say so.

1217
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,640
3 million, 1 million per kilo.

1218
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:46,966
What for?

1219
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,120
What difference does it make

1220
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,611
to you if bury her or not?

1221
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,689
Told you, want the animals

1222
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,763
to have something to eat too.

1223
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,321
That poor thing is dead,

1224
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,244
but those beasts are still alive.

1225
01:07:58,440 --> 01:07:59,885
Just take the money,

1226
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,201
never mind why.

1227
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,169
Are you haggling?

1228
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,441
Take it,

1229
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:13,602
4 million.

1230
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,649
Do we have a deal?

1231
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,884
Or shall take all this money and go?

1232
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,561
There's nothing left here,

1233
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,210
everyone's gone!

1234
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,010
Shall take the kid?

1235
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,764
I'm talking to you.

1236
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,684
What are you doing? Let's go.

1237
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,411
This is for those 3 poor kids.

1238
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,610
8 million,

1239
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,082
that's 2 each

1240
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,924
for the kids and your wife.

1241
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,920
Nothing for you, because
you're not a man.

1242
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,566
If you were, you'd have taken the money

1243
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,206
and gone without looking back.

1244
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:03,331
You don't want it? Fine.

1245
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,450
Stay and bury the dead.

1246
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,642
Try and dig the frozen rock.

1247
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:10,320
But don't think don't know how you feel.

1248
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,921
Know what it's like to lose a child.

1249
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,249
Did she have a name?

1250
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:19,607
Yes.

1251
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,566
A one day old had a name?

1252
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,085
She's called Banafsheh.

1253
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:27,411
The other 3 kids also have names,

1254
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,568
your wife also has a name.

1255
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,603
You'll regret it when they starve,

1256
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,569
and won't be here to help you.

1257
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,766
Who'll know why gave you this money?

1258
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,530
This kid will never speak,

1259
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:39,966
only you and know.

1260
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,561
Don't you touch me again.

1261
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:59,002
You want to set fire to your life?

1262
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,241
It's easy.

1263
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,890
How much do you earn in a week?

1264
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,041
100,000 max?

1265
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:11,090
Here blows one week's pay, idiot.

1266
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,126
Two weeks.

1267
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:17,642
Keep digging and it'll be three weeks.

1268
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,241
Three weeks.

1269
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,407
Keep digging, soon it'll be spring

1270
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,686
and the earth will breathe again

1271
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:26,807
and a hole will finally appear

1272
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:27,768
in front of you.

1273
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,131
4 weeks.

1274
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,885
5 weeks.

1275
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,401
Half a million cash down the toilet.

1276
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:41,686
Can you hear me?

1277
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,125
Mister!

1278
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:08,443
Why are you sitting here?

1279
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,646
Are you waiting for us? - What happened?

1280
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,170
Didn't you cross?

1281
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,529
Your brother said he was going

1282
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,728
to take you across. What happened?

1283
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,287
My brother's on the other side

1284
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,407
of the world.

1285
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,841
Let's go, I'll give you a ride.

1286
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,804
So who was the man you were with?

1287
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,646
He told you he was my brother? - Yes.

1288
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,171
He lied so you'd take the money.

1289
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,408
He said he'd come back for it.

1290
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:43,931
He won't come.

1291
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,764
You have to leave.

1292
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,007
Where's your brother?

1293
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,522
What brother? He's not my brother.

1294
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,370
Whoever. Where is he?

1295
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,087
He won't be coming.

1296
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:55,843
You must go.

1297
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,048
No, promised. He said he'd come back.

1298
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,129
Why don't you listen to sense?

1299
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,881
He won't come back.

1300
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,844
He let': the money for you;

1301
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,808
take it.

1302
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,247
Or leave it right here.

1303
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:13,126
I'll wait. He left it for safekeeping.

1304
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,367
Safekeeping?

1305
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,648
We wanted to give it you.

1306
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:20,084
You wouldn't take it! Remember?

1307
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,169
Please. - Don't you come near me!

1308
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,401
OK I'll say it from here.

1309
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,369
You have to leave, you'll catch cold.

1310
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,171
No need for you to worry about me.

1311
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,482
Your brother told me everything.

1312
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,410
If you cared, you wouldn't do

1313
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,130
what you did to your baby.

1314
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,845
What baby?

1315
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,529
Don't have a baby.

1316
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,326
Know. God rest her soul.

1317
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,726
Whose?

1318
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,764
What did that bastard tell you?

1319
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:46,445
We came to give you the money.

1320
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,563
Maybe you killed your brother too.

1321
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,364
Why don't you listen?

1322
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,449
God forgive you, Miss.

1323
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,240
Who are they?

1324
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,890
Good evening.

1325
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,603
Don't you remember me?

1326
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,529
Said good evening.

1327
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:58,810
Good evening.

1328
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:05,603
Where's your boyfriend?

1329
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,361
He's around. - Where?

1330
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:13,650
Needed something from that shack.

1331
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,486
There's always something missing.

1332
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:31,884
There's still so much left.

1333
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,644
What are you going to do?

1334
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,043
Money will move.

1335
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:39,684
Yeah but don't you want to go back?

1336
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,124
No hurry.

1337
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:46,286
But it takes time and it's dark.

1338
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:48,805
It's work.

1339
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,203
You pay others but never get paid.

1340
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:55,885
What kind of work is that?

1341
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,567
It's not our money.

1342
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:59,051
We're entrusted with it.

1343
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:06,250
And you leave it in
the toilet and leave.

1344
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,005
That's right.

1345
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,922
Giving alms looks easy,

1346
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,930
but it's hard work.

1347
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,288
Can ask you to give some of it

1348
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,441
to these guys?

1349
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:35,840
OK.

1350
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,486
Why not give it all, so you can be done?

1351
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,527
There's a system. We have to give

1352
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,762
a certain amount to everyone.

1353
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:00,527
What if we took it by force? Can't we?

1354
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:05,326
You can.

1355
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:12,966
Will you be upset?

1356
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:16,404
You want to give it to everyone;

1357
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,210
they're everyone.

1358
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,368
Will you be upset?

1359
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,521
No, not at all.

1360
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,250
Shall call them?

1361
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:37,491
Flash your light.

1362
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:39,687
Do what?

1363
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,410
Use your beamer.

1364
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:23,006
They all left

1365
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,925
and nobody offered me a ride.

1366
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,442
So you'll have to drop me off.

1367
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:34,881
Where?

1368
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:37,247
What?

1369
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,522
Where do you want to go?

1370
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,764
You want to take me?

1371
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,487
Isn't he waiting for you?

1372
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:48,607
Is it far?

1373
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:52,286
Told you, across the border.

1374
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,166
Will you come?

1375
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,561
No, not across the border.

1376
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:03,766
Right.

1377
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,127
Get out. I'll drive on my own.

1378
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,567
It's no big deal, I'll drive myself.

1379
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,848
It's going to rain.

1380
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:22,810
Forgot.

1381
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,923
What? - Hashish.

1382
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,569
Your boyfriend wanted some.

1383
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,242
I'm not into it,

1384
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,562
but the guys say it's good stuff.

1385
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:15,160
Get away, get lost.

1386
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,604
Hey! Let's go.

1387
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,921
I'm talking to you.

1388
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:11,487
Kaveh...

1389
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:14,405
Come help me bury this corpse.

1390
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,929
We'll do that later. Let's go.

1391
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:21,484
We can't leave it; the
dogs will eat her.

1392
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:22,960
What's your problem?

1393
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:25,242
Leila you tell them.

1394
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:26,447
We'll bring equipment.

1395
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,409
We won't leave the kid lying around.

1396
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,484
Can't you see the dogs?

1397
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:34,327
I'll stay here 'til they come back.

1398
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:36,326
You'll disappear again.

1399
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,448
Are these animals your problem?

1400
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:41,931
What are you doing?

1401
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,286
You killed them!

1402
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:46,086
Leave me alone you fucking psychopaths!

1403
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,484
Breakfast.

1404
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:16,169
Come in.

1405
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:23,284
Thanks.

1406
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,489
Can come in for a moment?

1407
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:30,051
Kaveh,

1408
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,041
get UP-

1409
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,009
He wants to talk to us.

1410
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:54,645
They've found your car

1411
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,406
in the next village, near the border.

1412
01:28:58,360 --> 01:28:59,327
Last night was asleep,

1413
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:00,891
there was a report of a murder.

1414
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:04,004
Apparently they stabbed the guy

1415
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,683
and took the money.

1416
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,562
But they didn't take the car.

1417
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,489
Abdollahi sent the body

1418
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:14,846
to the coroners;

1419
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,851
he had the sense

1420
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,002
not to mention the car.

1421
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:21,849
This way there's no mention

1422
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:22,887
of the money,

1423
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,610
the gun or the burial.

1424
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:27,967
But you have to leave...

1425
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,528
Not right now, have your tea.

1426
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:42,046
And you have to take this.

1427
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,487
If they find it here,
we'll be in trouble.

1428
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,243
But for god's sake, be careful.

1429
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:54,691
Sorry have nothing to offer

1430
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:56,649
but these biscuits.

1431
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:28,447
What if your commander finds out?

1432
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,288
Don't know.

1433
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,211
He'll hit us with extra service time.

1434
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:40,646
He's a tough guy.-

1435
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,328
If he found out tell him this:

1436
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:58,087
Our mother is from around here.

1437
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,201
She's old and ill, but very rich.

1438
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,405
She's asked us to give away

1439
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,289
some of her money in this area.

1440
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,764
Tell him, their money was clean,

1441
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:10,649
and their intention was good.

1442
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,281
And the rest is my own business.
