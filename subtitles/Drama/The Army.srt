3
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,600
My son, will you turn off
that wretched puppet?

4
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Brush your teeth.

5
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,300
Don't call him a puppet.

6
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,800
I beg your pardon.

7
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,500
Look, he's not a puppet.

8
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,800
Howdy Doody's real.

9
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,100
Well...
He's real.

10
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,700
Mr. Deedee Doodoo will
have to say good night.

11
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,500
Oh, no.

12
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,100
And remember,
you have to be asleep

13
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,700
when he comes
down the chimney.

14
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,600
It's not even a chimney, Pop.

15
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,900
He has his ways.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,300
Then I want to wait up.
Watch him do it.

17
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,500
Nonsense.

18
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,300
Okay.
I want a story then.

19
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,700
Oh, no, no, no.
No stories tonight.

20
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,900
Just one.
And then I'll go to bed.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,400
Right away.

22
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,200
Then I'll brush my teeth,
I promise.

23

"It is said that
at the dawn of time,

24

"man, beast and all magical beings lived
together under Aiglin the Father Tree.

with a hole in his heart,

"And in his infinite greed,

28

<i>" The blood of many an elf,</i>
<i>ogre and goblin</i>

<i>their war with man.</i>

31
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,300
<i>"And King Balor, the
one-armed king of Elfland,</i>

32
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,100
<i>" watched the slaughter</i>
<i>in dread and despair.</i>

33

<i>" But one day, the master</i>

34

<i>"seventy times 70 soldiers</i>

<i>" 'Build me this army, '

<i>" So a magical crown</i>

<i>" to command the Golden Army</i>
<i>if unchallenged.</i>

<i>" 'I am King Balor,</i>

But, wait, what if someone
could challenge him?

46
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Would they have a fight?

47
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,200
Well, most likely.

48
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,400
A challenge must
be answered.

49
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,600
But do you want to hear
the end of this story or not?

50
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,800
Yes, please.

51
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,900
Right.

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,100
"So the world was changed, and
the next time the humans marched,

53
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,800
<i>" they felt the earth</i>
<i>tremble beneath their feet</i>

54

<i>" The Golden Army had no

<i>"And King Balor's heart</i>
<i>grew heavy with regret.</i>

57
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,800
<i>" So he called a truce and
divided the crown in three pieces,</i>

58

<i>" one for the humans,</i>
<i>and two for himself.</i>

59
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,900
<i>" In exchange, man
would keep to the cities</i>

60

<i>" until the end of time.</i>

63
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,300
<i>" But Prince Nuada did not
believe in the promises of man.</i>

64
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,300
<i>"And it is said that</i>

<i>" vowing to return the day

68

"awaiting the day the crown

"Silent,
still and indestructible."

71
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,400
Wow. What does it
mean "industrable"?

72
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,700
Indestructible.

73
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,900
Indestruct...

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,100
It means no one
can destroy them.

75
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,300
Wow.

76
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,500
Go to sleep, my son.

77
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,500
But it's just
a story, right, Pops?

78
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Is it now?

79
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,100
Yeah, come on.

80
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,500
Those guys,
they can't be real.

81
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,700
Well, my son,
I'm sure you'll find out.

82
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,000
How long have you
been there, my friend?

83
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,700
They're over there.

84
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,200
I bought them today.

85
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,800
I haven't fed them at all.

86
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,000
I will go up first.
You will follow.

87
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,100
And remember, Mr. Wink,
don't be shy.

88
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,900
<i>Next lot. Number 776.</i>

89

91
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,300
<i>This was found</i>
<i>in a loess deposit</i>

92
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,800
<i>in a terrace about 30 meters
from the Shannon River.</i>

93
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,800
<i>And we'll open the</i>

94
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,100
<i>Three hundred thousand.</i>

<i>a piece of the Royal</i>
<i>Crown of Bethmoora.</i>

102
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,700
<i>The origin of this</i>
<i>piece harkens back</i>

103
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,100
<i>to the saga of</i>
<i>the Sons of the Earth</i>

104

<i>and the creation of</i>
<i>the fabled Golden Army.</i>

Ladies and gentlemen,
please keep your seats.

108
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,300
The auction will
restart shortly.

109
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,700
I'm sure this is just
a temporary loss of power.

110
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,300
Now, for the first
time at auction,

111
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,900
a piece of the Royal
Crown of Bethmoora,

112
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,100
coming to us from
a long lost culture.

113
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,600
Lost?

114
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,400
Not at all.

115
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,900
Forgotten by you,
perhaps,

116
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,400
but very, very much alive.

117
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,000
Who are you, sir?

118
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,100
Sir, please identify yourself.
You can't just...

119
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,700
I am Prince Nuada Silverlance,
son of King Balor.

120
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,400
And I am here, sir, to reclaim
what is rightfully mine.

121
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,600
Security. Call security!

122
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,800
What do you think
you're doing?

123
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,100
This is outrageous.

124
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Take what you want.
Please leave.

125
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,100
Anything, take anything.

126
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,200
Be quiet.

127
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,300
Sit down!

128
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,900
Proud, empty, hollow
things that you are.

129
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,700
Let this remind you why
you once feared the dark.

130
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,500
<i>Fishstick. We have to talk.</i>

131
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,600
Undercover.

132
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,100
Can't he get the
meaning of the word?

133
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,800
Look, we are still
government-funded.

134
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,500
We are still a secret, although
a dirty secret, if you ask me.

135
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,100
Officially we do
not exist, you see.

136
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,100
So that's the problem
when we get these.

137
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,500
Subway. Highway. Park.

138
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,900
And he posed for this one
and gave an autograph.

139
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,400
I suppress each photo.
Cell phone videos.

140
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,200
They cost me a fortune and
they show up on YouTube.

141
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,900
God, I hate YouTube.

142
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,200
Well, he just wants the world
outside to know what we do,

143
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,000
what he does.

144
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,900
He loathes me.

145
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't think so.

146
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,300
No?

147
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,500
Target practice.

148
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,600
Oh, dear.

149
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,000
And then he
posts them around.

150
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Do you know how
that makes me feel?

151
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,300
What's going on?

152
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,700
Oh, it's Friday.

153
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,600
I tell you, Fishstick,
he hates me.

154
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,800
He's out to destroy me.

155
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,800
My street cred is low.

156
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,000
Street cred?

157
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,200
My mojo.

158
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Washington, they're wondering
if I've got the stuff.

159
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,500
You think I have
an easy job?

160
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,500
Do you think
I enjoy being a pain in the neck?

161
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,700
I am medicated.

162
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,500
I mean,
this is not candy.

163
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,100
This is...
It's an antacid.

164
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,000
Yes, it's an
over-the-counter medicine,

165
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,700
but this is medicine.

166
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,300
You see, I worry
because, you know,

167
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,400
I mean, I am,
we are, after all,

168
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,600
we're just humble
public servants.

169
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,800
It's not about you.
He's acting out.

170
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,100
Things are a little
tense with Liz.

171
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,500
Tense? How tense?
Tense how?

172
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,000
Well, you know, the usual.

173
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,400
A new couple
making adjustments.

174
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,400
They argue.
They argue, huh?

175
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,600
Sometimes.
How bad?

176
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,000
Like everybody else.

177
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,000
They have good days
and bad days.

178
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm not done with you.

179
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,800
Hey, Abe.

180
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,300
Red, come back here!

181
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,500
Manning.

182
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,800
Pick up your clothes!

183
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

184
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,600
Put away your things!

185
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,700
Watch it,
boys, she's on fire.

186
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,700
Then again, there are
the really bad days.

187
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,900
I'm not afraid
of you, you know.

188
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,400
You should be.
Look at this mess. Look around.

189
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,400
I have one rule.
Don't touch my stuff.

190
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,900
Oh, I get it.
That's your rule. Okay.

191
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,300
The one and only.
I'm easy.

192
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,400
How's that even possible?

193
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Everything is your stuff.

194
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,300
The same CD, LP.

195
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,600
It's Al Green.

196
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,900
You can't listen
to Al Green on CD.

197
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,100
But it's good to keep.

198
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,700
And an eight-track.
An eight-track, Red?

199
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,400
Yeah, well, one day, the world's
gonna realize its mistake.

200
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,100
Eight-track was
the way to go, baby.

201
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,700
Come on, kids,
you can come out now.

202
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,400
That's right, it's all over.
That's right.

203
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,100
And what about me, Red?

204
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,800
I need some space.

205
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,400
At least enough to
find my toothbrush.

206
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,800
Toothbrush? Wait a minute.

207
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,900
It's right there.

208
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Red! I can't
live like this.

209
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,300
<i>Security breach</i>
<i>central Manhattan.</i>

210
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,600
Oh, damn.

211
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,400
Gotta go.
We all gotta go.

212
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
It's an emergency, right?

213
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,700
<i>Security breach.</i>
Let's go.

214
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,300
Red. Red!

215
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,900
<i>All personnel</i>
<i>to garage area.</i>

216
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,400
Hold on a sec.

217
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Oh, jeez, it's Manning.
Watch yourself, Liz.

218
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,900
Red. Red!

219
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,500
Listen.

220
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,600
Manning.
Hi.

221
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,900
We're going to
downtown Manhattan.

222
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,100
Yeah, it'll be fun.

223
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,600
Downtown.
Very dangerous.

224
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,100
Dangerous for you.

225
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,300
And for me.

226
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,600
Now, I know you dream
of the outside world,

227
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,100
but, trust me,
it's not that great.

228
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,800
It's savage, as a
matter of fact. Bad.

229
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,800
Come on, fellas,
let's get this out of here.

230
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,100
These, on the
other hand, are good.

231
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,700
Mmm.

232
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,400
Cuban.

233
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,000
Good.

234
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,200
Being seen?

235
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,300
Bad.

236
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,200
Exactly. I confiscated a box of these,
and I'll get you some more.

237
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,800
But you've gotta do me
a little favor tonight, out there.

238
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,400
You have to be...
You have to be very, very...

239
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
Discreet.

240
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,000
What? Thank you. Yes.
You're welcome.

241
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,300
Discreet.

242
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,500
Invisible. In and out.

243
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,700
Really?
Hey.

244
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,400
Hey, I can be
discreet if I wanna be.

245
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,000
I followed you
and Myers, didn't I?

246
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,100
And then you had him
transferred to Antarctica.

247
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,900
That's very discreet.

248
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,700
He said he liked the cold.

249
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,200
Like a shadow.

250
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,700
<i>Red team, Red team.</i>

251
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,700
Like a shadow
in the night.

252
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,700
US Customs discovered
a few illegally imported items.

253
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,300
It's a minor infraction.
And a gas pocket.

254
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,300
They detected
a gas pocket up there.

255
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,700
Now FBI agents,
under my command,

256
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,300
are going up there right now
with special gas equipment.

257
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Jeez, it stinks in here.

258
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,800
This is worse
than my room.

259
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,600
Waiting for a report on that.

260
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,900
Say "cheese."

261
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,600
Let's go.

262
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,100
Whatever they
called us for is over.

263
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,800
We had over 70
guests reported.

264
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,400
We have no survivors,
no bodies.

265
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,000
Same story here, babe.

266
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,500
<i>Don't call me "babe."</i>

267
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,600
"Abe," I said.
"Abe." Wrong channel.

268
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,900
Abe, I think Liz is
still mad at me.

269
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,400
<i>Still the same channel.</i>

270
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Oh!

271
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,200
<i>Can I ask</i>
<i>you a question?</i>

272
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,500
No.

273
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,400
Now, listen.
When we get home later,

274
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,200
I'm gonna clean up
my whole mess.

275
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,500
That's not the problem.

276
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
What is it?

277
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700
Not now.

278
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,500
Abe, what have you got?

279
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,700
Oh, this is interesting.

280
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,300
Both boxes have
the Royal Seal.

281
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,200
Only delivered
at a time of war.

282
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,200
Red? We have company.

283
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,900
<i>Come on, Blue,</i>
<i>give me something to work with here.</i>

284
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,400
Burrowing creatures.

285
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,900
How many of them?
<i>- Many.</i>

286
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
There are no corpses because
there are no leftovers.

287
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,900
<i>Have you noticed the floor?</i>

288
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Oh, crap.

289
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,100
<i>Precisely.</i>

290
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,200
All these things
do is eat and eat.

291
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Then poop,
and then eat again.

292
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,100
Remind you of anyone?

293
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,700
Damn it, Abe.
What are these things?

294
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,800
<i>English, English.</i>

295
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,900
Oh, they're Tooth Fairies.

296
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,100
Ha!

297
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,300
No, no. Third century,
Black Forest.

298
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,100
Feed mostly on calcium,
bones, skin, organs.

299
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,000
But they do go
for the teeth first.

300
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,100
Hence the name
Tooth Fairies.

301
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,000
I bet you they don't
leave money, either.

302
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,000
Oh, my God.

303
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,000
Liz, you're pregnant.

304
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,300
No, I'm not.

305
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,800
Yes, you are.

306
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,100
What have you got, Marble?

307
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,000
Think I may have found one.

308
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,600
But he's kind of cute.

309
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,800
Don't go near it!

310
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,800
It's biting me!

311
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,500
Marble.

312
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,400
It hurts! It hurts!

313
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,200
<i>Red, we need you here!</i>

314
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,400
Marble.

315
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,900
Nasty little...

316
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,000
Keep firing, Abe.
Keep firing!

317
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,100
Damn.

318
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,000
Sorry, lady.

319
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You should be running.

320
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,100
There's a safe upstairs.

321
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,600
How do we get there?

322
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,100
We need a clearing.

323
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,300
Run!

324
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,800
Up to the safe, now!

325
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,900
Abe. Up the stairs.

326
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,000
Come on, Liz, burn them all.
Go. Go!

327
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,100
Yes, we're going!

328
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,300
Get in the safe, Abe.
Get in the safe!

329
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,400
Oh, no, no.

330
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,900
No, no, no!

331
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,100
Steel!

332
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,300
Damned beasts.

333
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,800
Fire is mine.

334
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,000
Fire is in me.

335
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,700
Red, stay away
from the window!

336
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,400
Fire is me.

337
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,900
Stop biting me!

338
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,000
Fire is me.

339
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,600
World, here I come.

340
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,000
What have you done?

341
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,100
Guess we're out.

342
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,300
Hey, Hellboy,
over here.

343
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
Your Royal Highness.

344
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,400
Before entering
the council chamber,

345
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,900
you must surrender
your weapon.

346
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,500
I will not.

347
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:30,700
It is protocol, sire,
for peasant and prince alike.

348
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,600
For you, Sister,

349
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,900
anything.

350
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,300
<i>According to multiple eye witnesses,
lives were, in fact, endangered.</i>

351
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,900
<i>There you have it, Hellboy.</i>

352
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,700
<i>But is he really</i>
<i>on our side?</i>

353
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,100
<i>Do you have superpowers?</i>

354
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,400
<i>Well, yeah.</i>

355
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,100
<i>But, really, all I wanna be
is just an ordinary person,</i>

356
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,400
<i>just like you and</i>
<i>you and everybody.</i>

357
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
Hey, guys.
You're missing this.

358
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,000
We're on TV.

359
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,100
Liz. Liz,
are you all right?

360
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,000
Yeah, I'll be out
in a minute.

361
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,700
You don't need to do that.
You can trust me.

362
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,000
My readings are
quite accurate.

363
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,200
Shut up, Abe.

364
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,900
Get your damn hand
away from the door.

365
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,000
You have nothing to fear.

366
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,400
In spite of appearances,

367
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,300
I believe Red would be an
excellent father figure.

368
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,900
<i>And what about this guy?</i>

369
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,700
<i>Walking around with a
toilet seat on his head.</i>

370
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,000
A toilet seat!

371
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,400
It's quite obvious it's
a breathing apparatus.

372
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,700
Hey, I think we gotta
lose the garbage truck.

373
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,800
Sends out the wrong signal.

374
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,200
You think that's
our problem?

375
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,800
Transportation?

376
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,400
<i>And this girl, we definitely have
to find out what's wrong with her.</i>

377
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
<i>She's cute, though.</i>
<i>We should get her on the show.</i>

378
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,400
I hate it when
people stare at me.

379
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,200
Makes me feel
like a freak.

380
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,400
You had no right, Red.

381
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,600
It's Manning. Could you...

382
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,700
<i>How many times do</i>
<i>I have to tell you?</i>

383
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,500
<i>It's a gas pocket.</i>

384
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,000
<i>And a gaseous</i>
<i>phenomenon that occurred...</i>

385
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,400
Gas pocket.
What an idiot.

386
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,300
You've murdered me.

387
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,600
You have murdered me.

388
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,400
You have ridiculed me.

389
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,000
And you have brought
this unto yourself.

390
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,300
What?

391
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,300
Washington is sending
down a new BPRD agent.

392
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,800
A new guy?

393
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,100
Why?

394
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,600
To look after you.

395
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,800
Sire, please.

396
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,900
To set us free.
All of us, Father.

397
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,600
A truce based on shame.

398
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,600
The humans have
forgotten the gods,

399
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,100
destroyed the Earth.
And for what?

400
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Parking lots.
Shopping malls.

401
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,400
Greed has burned a hole in their
heart that will never be filled.

402
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,600
They will never
have enough.

403
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
Honor?

404
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,400
Look at this place.
Where is the honor in it?

405
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,900
Father, you were
once a proud warrior.

406
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,300
When did you
become their pet?

407
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,100
I have returned
from exile to wage war

408
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,900
and reclaim our land,
our birthright.

409
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,100
And for that, I will call upon
the help of all of my people.

410
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,300
And they will answer,

411
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,600
the good, the bad

412
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,000
and the worst.

413
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,500
Perhaps I am.
Perhaps they made me so.

414
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,900
We will not fade.

415
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,000
It is.

416
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,800
I am sorry, Father.

417
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,500
And you, Sister, are you at
peace with your king's verdict?

418
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,100
I am, my brother. I am.

419
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,000
Then very well.
Death it is.

420
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,100
Now, for the final piece,
my sister.

421
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,400
Where is she, Wink?
Where is she?

422
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,500
Go find her.
Now! Find her!

423
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,200
<i>Elevator</i>
<i>arriving now to section 42.</i>

424
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,200
<i>Elevator arriving</i>
<i>now to section 42.</i>

425
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,900
Pardon me, boys.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

426
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,600
Is he here?
Not yet.

427
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,800
I'm telling you,
we don't need this guy.

428
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,000
Well, I think we do.

429
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,700
Evidently, this guy's quite
the big shot in Washington.

430
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,900
What's his name?

431
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
His name is Johann Krauss.

432
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,700
Johann Krauss?
Sounds German.

433
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,300
He's the top man in...

434
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Ectoplasmic.

435
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,700
Yes, thank you.
Ectoplasmic research.

436
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,300
Comes highly recommended
by our European liaison.

437
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,700
Johann Krauss.
"Liaison."

438
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,400
I love that word,
don't you?

439
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,000
It's so hoity toity.

440
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,500
I don't like Germans.
No fingerprints.

441
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,300
Here he comes.
Germans make me nervous.

442
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,600
No photo. Dossier says, and I translate,
"He has a nice open face."

443
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,500
Oh, my God.

444
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,800
<i>Damen und Herren,</i>
Johann Krauss at your service.

445
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
I like him.

446
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,700
Look at that.
Poor little thing.

447
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,500
Bought and sold on
the black market.

448
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,100
Crammed into
cargo containers.

449
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,600
Smuggled, abused.

450
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,200
He has very
expressive hands.

451
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,300
The seal on the box
worries me also.

452
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,500
A warring emblem.

453
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,700
Yes, from the Bethmoora clan.

454
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,800
The Sons of the Earth.

455
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,100
Your file says you're the
brains of the operation,

456
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,600
and I must admit,
I'm impressed.

457
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,500
In my file, you'll see,
Mr. Krauss,

458
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,600
that I worked very closely
with Abe in his training.

459
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,700
<i>Ja,</i> okay.

460
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,700
Let's see what our little
friend here can remember.

461
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,900
Memory gets a little sketchy
right after you've burned to death.

462
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,300
But maybe Saint
Malachy can help.

463
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,600
Oh, no, no.
No amulets, <i>Mein Herr.</i>

464
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,900
Teleplasty.

465
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,500
Plastic. Very modern.

466
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,900
Teleplasty by which
an ectoplasmic medium,

467
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
such as Dr. Krauss,
can control inanimate things,

468
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:52,600
organic, mechanical,
dead or alive.

469
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,600
Take it, take it all in,
<i>mein Junge.</i>

470
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,100
There we are. Get up.

471
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,600
Get up. Get up.

472
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,700
Now I have full control
of its limbic system.

473
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,800
Let us see how long
I can hold it.

474
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,400
What?

475
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,800
Hey, you chewed off
the tip of my tail.

476
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,800
Yeah, you, you little...

477
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,300
It says you're rude, brutish
<i>und</i> not very bright.

478
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Wow!

479
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,000
It seems our
little friend here

480
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,900
remembers market
sounds and voices.

481
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,500
And a peculiar
troll language spoken

482
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,100
in the last place
his cage was opened.

483
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,000
The troll market.

484
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,900
The troll market?
Come on.

485
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,300
No one's ever found it.

486
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
That's because
it doesn't exist.

487
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,200
Mr. Krauss? Dr. Krauss, sir.

488
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,400
Our little informant there
doesn't look so good.

489
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,800
Back inside, you.
There we are.

490
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,300
So, now we know
where to begin.

491
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Trolls dwell under bridges.

492
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,400
Wow. You're a genius.

493
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,900
By the way, there's over
2,000 bridges in New York City.

494
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,100
But Vladimir Vanya, 19th
century occult historian,

495
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,600
places the troll
market directly under

496
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,200
the east end of
the Brooklyn Bridge.

497
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
We've already looked there.

498
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,100
Yes, you have,
but not with me, Agent.

499
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,700
Not with me.

500
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,400
We're moving in.

501
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,000
Keep it coming, keep it coming.
Hold it.

502
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,400
"Not with me, Agent."
What an ego.

503
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,500
I like him.

504
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,500
Well, you can keep him.

505
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,200
I mean, am I the only one that
thinks this guy is full of...

506
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,600
No, no, no, no,
don't lean.

507
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,400
Lot 336, the Schufftein
glasses. Could it be?

508
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,100
The three surviving
pairs,

509
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,800
and we will use them to
locate the troll market.

510
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,700
Dr. Krauss, what a coup.

511
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,500
The Schufftein glasses.

512
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,600
You're my hero.

513
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,800
Hey. You Hellboy?

514
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,900
Yeah.

515
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,600
You're ugly, man.

516
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,300
Two more on
the wall in front of me

517
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,000
and then three on
the alleys facing that way.

518
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,400
What do you think of
Mr. Know-It-All?

519
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Don't know,
too early to tell.

520
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,900
Hey, you're Hellboy.

521
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,100
I know, I'm ugly.

522
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,600
Forget it.

523
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,400
We'll talk about it later.

524
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,700
He's sure of himself, and I
think maybe you're intimidated.

525
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,700
Intimidated. Huh?

526
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,300
<i> Keep us up to date on thecameras, Agent Sherman.
Over and out.</i>

527
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,800
What's this?

528
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,100
Normally, we can't see
fairy folk and trolls.

529
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,700
They generate a cloaking
aura called "glamour."

530
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,100
But in 1878,
Emil Schufftein designed and built these.

531
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,000
<i>Four crystal diopters</i>
<i>that penetrate that effect</i>

532
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,600
<i>and reveal the true</i>
<i>nature of things.</i>

533
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,700
Oh, Dr. Krauss, they're more
beautiful than I'd imagined.

534
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,100
You must try them on then.
Oh, yes.

535
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,100
Try them on, Agent.
They'll look good.

536
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,000
I love these tight
little leather straps.

537
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,400
Intimidated?

538
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,400
Mr. Kraut? Sir?

539
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,500
Krauss, Agent.
With a double "S."

540
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,600
S-S. Right, right.

541
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,900
Listen, those gizmos?

542
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,400
How do you know they work?

543
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,500
<i>I have a suspect.</i>

544
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,300
Give me a vector,
Agent Sherman. A vector.

545
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,000
B-12, the alley, northbound.

546
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,300
<i>Well, track the target.</i>
<i>We're coming down.</i>

547
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,600
Keep an eye on her.
I'll be right back.

548
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,400
This little old lady?
Come on.

549
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,400
It's a Fragglewump,
an ugly Scottish troll.

550
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,100
They're afraid of canaries.

551
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,200
Oh, my God. Canaries, huh?

552
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,300
What about the kittens?

553
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,400
She feeds on them.

554
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,800
Come on, then.
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

555
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,500
That thing is a "she"?

556
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,100
Down, you fools.

557
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,500
What do you think
you are doing?

558
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,800
She's gonna eat the cat.

559
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,800
You'll make her
aware of our presence.

560
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,000
We should use
the canary now.

561
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,200
She's gonna eat it!

562
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,500
We should use
the bird, Dr. Krauss.

563
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,700
The bird.

564
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,300
She's going to eat the cat.

565
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,500
You will stay put
and follow my orders.

566
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,600
I can't sit by here...

567
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,700
You are directly under my command,
and you have to obey.

568
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,400
Stay put!
Oh, screw this!

569
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,800
Hey! Lucy.

570
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,100
Come back here.

571
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,900
I'm home.

572
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,400
Oh, yes, dearie.
Can I help you?

573
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,700
Give it up, nasty.
We can see you.

574
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,100
You see me?

575
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,700
How? How do you see me?

576
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,300
We're looking
for the entrance

577
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,800
to the troll market.
Any clues?

578
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,100
Come any closer and
I'll rip your heart.

579
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,900
We're gonna have to get
a little old-school, Abe.

580
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,700
Give me the bird.

581
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,000
Not a canary.

582
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,800
What, you're afraid
of this little guy?

583
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,200
Who'd know?

584
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,500
No more, no more.

585
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,100
I'll take you there.

586
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,900
Come on, let's go,
you dirty old troll.

587
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,300
Let's go.

588
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,100
Agent Sherman, we are
going into the troll market.

589
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,600
Keep communication
to a minimum.

590
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,000
Over <i>und</i> out.

591
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,800
I like him.

592
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,500
You see, this is
a man who takes charge.

593
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,600
You think?

594
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,800
Yeah. He's efficient.

595
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,700
He's precise.

596
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,200
You add "resistant" to that,
you got yourself a new watch.

597
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,000
Dr. Krauss is aware of the
chain of command, and he...

598
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,200
Oh, brother!

599
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,800
He seems to like me.

600
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,000
Here we are.

601
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,500
Wow, that's some door!

602
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,600
It's a complex
combination lock.

603
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,800
What do you think,
Agent Sapien?

604
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,000
Not good.

605
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,200
With the number of symbols on the
combination, we'll be here for days.

606
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,400
Well, not necessarily.

607
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,200
Let me try my technique.

608
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,600
Open it, Lucy.

609
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,200
I will not.

610
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,500
Pretty please.

611
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,700
Do as you may, demon.

612
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,500
Release the yellow beast.

613
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,800
Tear my eyes out.

614
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,800
Rip my insides and
my legs and my tongue,

615
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,200
but I will never
open that door.

616
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,600
Is that your
investigative technique?

617
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,800
It said "never."

618
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,400
It's unconscionable.

619
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,500
That means
he didn't like it.

620
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,900
What?

621
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,900
So, what, you're gonna
show us how it's done,

622
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Mr. By-The-Book?

623
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,700
Is that it?

624
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,200
Yes, I think I will.

625
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,200
There we are.

626
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,400
Let me see. Yes.

627
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,400
Gentlemen, welcome
to the troll market.

628
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,800
<i>Red, there's something really
important that I need to tell you.</i>

629
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,400
Oh, Liz, you should
be here. You'd love it.

630
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,900
Nobody's looking at us.
We blend right in.

631
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,700
Agent, I said keep
communication to a minimum.

632
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,400
You'll blow our cover.

633
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,300
You know?
I think he's right.

634
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,000
I'm bringing you
here for sure, babe.

635
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,700
<i>The fishbowl wants</i>
<i>radio silence. So...</i>

636
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,400
Over and out.

637
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,900
The Royal Seal.

638
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,700
Brother Red.
Red, do you read me?

639
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,700
Yeah, I read you, Blue,
but I'm watching Sherlock at work.

640
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,900
I'll get back to you.

641
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,100
Excuse me, sir.

642
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,900
Sir, excuse... Pardon me.
Sir, may I ask a...

643
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,400
I gotta tell
the boys that one.

644
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,500
Excuse me, gentlemen.

645
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,500
Have you seen anyone purchasing
this type of Tooth Fairy?

646
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,200
No one sells them
down here, pal.

647
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,800
Over in Jersey, maybe.

648
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,900
Well, what about this, then?

649
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Do you recognize this seal?

650
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,500
Make him go away.
Make him go away.

651
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,000
No. We don't.

652
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,200
Please, dear sir.

653
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,800
You'd better go. Now!

654
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,100
We'll make it
worth your while.

655
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,000
Don't waste your time.
We will not talk!

656
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,500
What are you doing?

657
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,300
You're absolutely
sure about that, huh?

658
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,800
Absolutely.

659
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,900
You won't talk, eh?

660
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Never.

661
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,300
Never, huh?

662
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,800
Never ever, ever.

663
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,000
Feeling a little
chattier now?

664
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,500
We'll never talk.

665
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,100
Yes, yes.

666
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,700
We will, only don't
hit me anymore.

667
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,300
Chicken.

668
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,000
Who bought
the Tooth Fairies?

669
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,700
Prince Nuada.

670
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,800
They say Prince Nuada
broke the truce,

671
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,500
and now there is
talk of war,

672
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,700
a war with
the human world.

673
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,400
Sorry, kid.

674
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,800
That's all right.

675
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,400
Nice baby.

676
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,900
I'm not a baby.
I'm a tumor.

677
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:27,300
Yes, Red. I am following
a lead right now.

678
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,000
It may turn out...

679
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,700
It may turn out
to be nothing,

680
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,200
but I will let you
know soon enough.

681
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,900
What do you want?
Tell me your name.

682
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,200
Follow me.

683
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,700
Your father
left you this map.

684
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,800
In it, he said,
lies the secret

685
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,500
to the location
of the Golden Army.

686
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,200
Move away!
Quickly, Your Highness.

687
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,500
Can I help you
with something?

688
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,400
No, thank you.
I'm just looking.

689
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,200
You can't go in there!

690
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,700
Sir, why
are you following me?

691
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,300
I...

692
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,300
I was just hoping to find
an old map chart of Algiers.

693
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,900
Why are you following me?

694
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,600
I was not.

695
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,500
Did my brother send you
to steal the crown piece?

696
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,800
Your brother?

697
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,700
Oh, you're sorely
mistaken, I assure you.

698
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,700
Then answer me truthfully.

699
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,500
Why were you following me?

700
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,700
My name is Abraham Sapien.

701
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,600
There is no such name.

702
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,000
Oh, I don't like
it either, but I...

703
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,300
Enough.

704
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,600
Give me your hand.

705
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,000
Your hand.

706
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,200
You are an agent

707
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,500
for the Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense.

708
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,400
And your name is...

709
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,800
Oh...

710
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,800
Horrible, I know.

711
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,500
I'm Nuala,
Princess Nuala.

712
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,600
Yes, I know.

713
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,500
Forgive me,
Your Highness,

714
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,500
but as you were
learning about me,

715
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,800
I couldn't help but learn
a bit about you myself.

716
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,000
I know that you
need our help.

717
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,100
I'm afraid it's
the other way around.

718
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,500
The window. Out now.

719
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,900
I will take care of this.

720
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,200
Oh, dear.

721
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,300
Go! Now go!

722
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,700
Get out of here, Blue.

723
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,600
Yes. Come with me,
Your Highness.

724
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,600
You.

725
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,600
Let me put this to you
as delicately as I can.

726
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,600
My cigar, it was Cuban.

727
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,200
Now you pissed me off.

728
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,700
Oh, crap.

729
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,100
Whoa!

730
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,500
Now stay down!

731
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:00,800
Damn.

732
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,400
A tooth. Happy?

733
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,500
Give it up, pal.
It's over.

734
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,300
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

735
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,500
Wow. Told you.

736
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,900
<i>Oh, mein Gott,</i>
what have you done, Agent Hellboy?

737
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,800
Look at this!
Now we have to leave.

738
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,400
Red. This is Princess Nuala.

739
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,600
Lady.

740
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,000
We should leave.
Now. Now!

741
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,300
Let's go.

742
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:35,900
To wage his war,
my brother needs this,

743
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,200
the final piece of
the Crown of Bethmoora

744
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,800
and this map to the location
of the Golden Army chamber.

745
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,900
The Golden Army.

746
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,600
The harbingers of death.

747
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,300
The unstoppable tide.

748
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,100
Howdy Doody.

749
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,000
Your Highness, if you hand
the crown piece over to us...

750
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,200
No. Where it goes, I go.

751
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,600
My father died to uphold
the truce with your world.

752
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,400
You must honor
his noble intention.

753
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,800
The lady's
in dire danger.

754
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,500
I take it you're vouching for her,
Agent Sapien?

755
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,000
Most emphatically.
Yes, I am.

756
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,300
Even so.

757
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,900
I am sorry, but we
simply cannot assume

758
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
such responsibility
on our own.

759
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,500
The lady just
lost her father.

760
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,900
What more do you want?

761
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:18,200
You may not care, but
there are procedures, rules

762
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,700
and little handbooks...

763
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,200
She's coming with us.

764
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,400
You got that, Gas Bag?

765
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,500
What did you call me?

766
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,000
You.

767
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,000
You will pay for what happened
to my friend down there.

768
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,300
Yeah, right.
You take checks?

769
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,600
Demon.

770
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,000
Born from a womb of shadows.

771
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,900
Sent to destroy their world,
and you still believe you belong.

772
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,400
Are we gonna
talk all night?

773
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,200
'Cause I'm really sleepy.

774
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,400
No, Brother, no!

775
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,000
Kill him.

776
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,600
It's just a jumping bean.

777
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,500
It's going for water. Hurry.

778
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,200
Oh, dear.

779
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,000
No. No, no, no, no. No.

780
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,200
What the hell is that?
- Excuse me!

781
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,300
Stay back.
- Hey, what's going on?

782
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,400
We've got
target in sight.

783
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,700
It's an Elemental,

784
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,900
a giver of life
and a destroyer.

785
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,100
What?

786
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,400
A Forest God.

787
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,600
A Forest God, eh?

788
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,800
I'm gonna get me Big Baby.

789
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:54,200
Somebody help! My baby's...
Help! Help!

790
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:55,900
How can I help you, ma'am?

791
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,700
My baby's inside!

792
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,700
Come with us,
dear lady, please.

793
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,200
There's nothing
to worry about.

794
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,700
We've got everything
under control.

795
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,900
Please. My baby's
still in there! Please!

796
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,800
Hey, little guy.

797
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,500
Homing in on target.

798
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,900
Hang on, kid.

799
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,600
Agent Hellboy.

800
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,900
Reach higher ground
and shoot the weapon.

801
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,400
Shoot the weapon!

802
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,800
First praise the tail, kid.

803
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,400
You must shoot it in
the energy ganglion.

804
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,500
The what?

805
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,600
The energy ganglion.

806
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:41,500
Scheisse. The head!
Shoot it in the head!

807
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:43,200
Whoa!

808
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:54,700
Oh, crap.

809
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:02,000
You gotta trust me,
little buddy. Okay?

810
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,800
You woke up the baby.

811
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,100
Agent Hellboy,
take the shot!

812
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,100
Right now! Take it!

813
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,200
That's an order!
Take the shot.

814
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,300
That's an order,
Agent Hellboy.

815
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:55,000
Shoot it!
Shoot the gun! Shoot the gun!

816
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,100
Demon.

817
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,400
What are you waiting for?

818
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,700
This is what you
wanted, isn't it?

819
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:07,800
Look at it.
It's the last of its kind.

820
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,600
Like you and I.
You destroy it,

821
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:17,000
the world will never
see its like again.

822
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,200
Shoot it!

823
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,800
You have more in common
with us than with them.

824
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,100
It's breaking free.

825
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,600
You could be a king.

826
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,300
You will not
disobey a direct order!

827
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,200
Shoot it!
It's getting loose!

828
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,400
If you cannot command...

829
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,500
It will
destroy everything!

830
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:34,800
That's an order,
Agent Hellboy!

831
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,000
...then you must obey.

832
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:38,000
Shoot it now!
Damn.

833
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,600
Shoot it!

834
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:17,100
Move back.
Step back, step back.

835
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,200
It's beautiful.

836
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:20,800
and this huge monster
just came out of nowhere!

837
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,100
Yo, give the
baby back, man!

838
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:35,600
Oh, what have you
done to my baby?

839
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:36,700
The baby's fine.

840
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,800
You freak!

841
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:39,100
Hellboy,
what'd you do to that baby?

842
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,400
The baby's fine.

843
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,000
Don't move.
Hands in the air! Up!

844
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:44,700
He's got a weapon
in his hand.

845
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,800
That is his hand.

846
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,600
Miss, stay away from him
for your own safety.

847
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,800
He was trying to help.
Don't you see?

848
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:54,100
He was just trying to help.

849
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,500
That's all we do.

850
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,100
That's all we've
done all these years.

851
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,600
She's touching
his hand!

852
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,800
We've just tried to
help you. You.

853
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,300
You're a goddamn freak.

854
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,900
We don't need
you around!

855
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,500
What a freak.

856
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,700
Liz.

857
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,900
Let's go home.

858
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:41,100
... investigation of the BPRD and its
promotion of intra-species marriage

859
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,500
seen by many as a threat
to traditional families,

860
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,400
fuelled by federal funds.

861
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:49,800
I didn't touch you yet.

862
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,800
You did a good job
out there.

863
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,800
Then tell me, why
don't I feel so good?

864
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:06,400
I mean, I killed that thing.
And for what?

865
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:10,100
They don't even like me.

866
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,000
I mean, they're afraid of me.

867
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,600
What do we do with that?

868
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Red, I don't want
you to freak out.

869
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,800
I'm gonna leave
for a little bit.

870
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:27,600
I need time to think.

871
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,900
About what?

872
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,200
Can't you do your
thinking right here?

873
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,300
Look, I'll be really,
really quiet.

874
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,300
I'll get rid of the cats.

875
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,000
Red, why are you with me?

876
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:43,700
Do you need
everyone to like you?

877
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:47,000
Everybody?
Or am I enough?

878
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,700
Think about it.

879
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:02,000
You stay.
We belong dead.

880
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:12,500
It's blank.
No coordinates.

881
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,400
"Be near me
when my light is low

882
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:33,000
"When the blood creeps and
the nerves prick and tingle

883
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,700
"And the heart is sick and
all the wheels of being slow

884
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:44,500
"Be near me when the sensuous frame is
wracked with pangs that conquer trust

885
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,500
"And time, a maniac..."

886
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,700
Tennyson, "In Memoriam."
A beautiful poem.

887
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,400
Forgive me, I didn't
mean to startle you.

888
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,700
Oh, no. No, no.
I borrowed this book.

889
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:54,900
I hope you don't mind.

890
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,900
Oh, no, no. Please,
this is your home now.

891
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,300
You are safe here.

892
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:01,900
My brother will find me.
He always does.

893
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,100
How could he?

894
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,700
Our location is a highly
classified secret.

895
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:07,400
Yes, but I know of it now,
which means that he does, too.

896
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,700
We're twins.

897
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:12,400
Even as children, a link has
bound us one to the other.

898
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,800
Something I cannot explain.

899
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,500
No need.

900
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,700
You look different.

901
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,100
Oh, do I?

902
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:23,300
Perhaps my hair?

903
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,500
No.

904
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,900
It's your eyes.
I can see your eyes.

905
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,300
Yes. Just trying
a new look.

906
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,200
Is that a map?

907
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,800
Yes, it was in the cylinder.

908
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,800
There are no coordinates.

909
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,800
Perhaps there's
a watermark.

910
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,800
You were very brave
vouching for me.

911
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:59,200
How do you know I'm not
the enemy, bringing me here?

912
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:02,300
It's as you were
saying just now.

913
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:06,900
From intuition maybe,
a link.

914
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:13,000
Normally I'm able to
read others quite quickly,

915
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,400
but I've never met
anyone like you.

916
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,600
Nor I, like you.

917
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,700
Good night, Abraham.

918
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,300
Good night, Princess.
Your Highness.

919
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,200
Your Majesty.
Your... Ma'am.

920
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,000
Ma'am?

921
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,900
Gute Nacht,
Agent Hellboy.

922
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:12,900
Look, Agent,
I know you don't like me,

923
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,700
but I could take
away your badge.

924
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,600
Never had one.

925
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,900
Kept asking, though.

926
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,100
You will learn to
obey me, follow protocol

927
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:23,300
and stay fockused
at all times.

928
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,900
Oh, that word "fockused."

929
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,100
Yeah, with your accent,
I wouldn't use it that much.

930
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,200
I knew Professor Broom,
young man.

931
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,500
You didn't know
Professor Broom.

932
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,700
Yes, I did.

933
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,100
After my accident...
Shut up. Shut up.

934
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,800
...he designed
this containment suit.

935
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,500
A wonderful man.

936
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,000
And even then he was worried
about your future. He...

937
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:41,900
Hey, Gas Bag, stop it!

938
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:44,800
Right now.

939
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:47,100
Or what?
Are you threatening me?

940
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:49,700
Because I think
I can take you.

941
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,300
Excuse me?

942
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,700
You heard me.

943
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:00,400
I couldn't hear you
from all the way over there.

944
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:04,200
I can take you because
you have one fatal flaw.

945
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:06,400
Oh, I wanna hear it.

946
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,800
No, you don't.
You can't take criticism.

947
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,500
Try me.

948
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,400
Can't take it.

949
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,700
What's my flaw?

950
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,700
Your temper.
It gets the best of you.

951
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,400
Makes you weak.
Makes you vulnerable.

952
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:27,500
Oh, crap.

953
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:29,800
Johann.

954
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,600
Johann? Johann?

955
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,600
Hey, Johann?

956
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,500
Come on, pal.
Hang in there, will you?

957
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,900
Johann? Johann?

958
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,100
Damn.

959
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:01,300
Ow!

960
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,800
There we are.

961
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:42,400
Your temper,
it makes you sloppy.

962
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,500
Try to control it,
Agent Hellboy.

963
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,400
Before it controls you.

964
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,200
Glasshole.

965
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,300
Mmm.

966
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:11,300
Huh?

967
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:28,700
Hello, Red.

968
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,000
Well, you're up late.

969
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:31,300
What are you listening to?

970
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:34,400
Vivaldi.
Il cimento dell'armonia.

971
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:35,800
I particularly
like the last...

972
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:37,200
Hey, hey. What's that?

973
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:39,000
Just a remote.

974
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,300
This? Yes.

975
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,400
"Popular Love Songs."

976
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:51,800
Oh, Abe.

977
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:55,400
You fell for the Princess.

978
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,600
She's... She's like me.

979
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,000
A creature from
another world.

980
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,900
You need to get out more.

981
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
She's alone in the world.
I wanna help her.

982
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,200
I need to care for her.

983
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,600
You're in love.
Have a beer.

984
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,600
Oh, my body's a temple.

985
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:16,800
Well, now it's an
amusement park.

986
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:17,800
No, no, no.

987
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:18,900
The glandular balance of...

988
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,200
Just shut up and
drink it, would you?

989
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:26,000
What track?
Eight.

990
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:28,600
Can't Smile Without You.

991
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:30,000
I know.

992
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,100
Yep, I'm gonna need
a beer, too.

993
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,400
Well, see, I love this song.

994
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,100
And I can't smile or cry.

995
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,500
I think I have
no tear ducts.

996
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,900
I wish Father were here.

997
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,100
He'd know what to tell
you. Us.

998
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,300
I can't smile without you

999
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:05,000
I can't laugh
and I can't sing

1000
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:09,400
I'm finding it hard
to do anything

1001
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:15,400
You see,
I feel sad when you're sad

1002
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:20,500
I feel glad when you're glad

1003
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:25,300
If you only knew
what I'm going through

1004
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:33,200
I just can't
smile without you

1005
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,600
You came along

1006
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,900
Just like a song

1007
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,200
And brightened my day

1008
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:47,600
Who'd have believed that
you were part of a dream?

1009
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:53,000
Now it all seems
light years away

1010
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:59,200
And now you know I can't
smile without you

1011
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:04,400
I can't smile without you

1012
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:07,300
Nuala.

1013
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:18,900
Good dog.

1014
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,700
Security detail
for the front gate, immediately.

1015
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,400
It's the last one.

1016
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:02,000
Look at her.
She's it, Abe.

1017
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:03,600
She's it.

1018
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,700
She's my whole wide...

1019
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
You know?

1020
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,700
Yeah. Yeah.

1021
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:15,100
I would give
my life for her.

1022
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,600
But she also wants me
to do the dishes.

1023
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,300
I would die
and do the dishes.

1024
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,400
Why is she mad at me?

1025
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,100
It's not because
the room is dirty.

1026
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,700
Something else.

1027
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,300
Well, ask her, then.

1028
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,300
No.

1029
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:36,900
Listen, Abe.

1030
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Yeah.

1031
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
When a woman's
mad about something,

1032
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,900
but she's really mad
about something else,

1033
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,800
you can't ask because then they
get angry because you had to ask.

1034
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,300
Do you know what I mean?

1035
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,800
Never mind,
don't answer that question.

1036
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,500
You gotta just...

1037
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,500
Yeah.

1038
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,700
...find out.

1039
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,500
Very quick of you.
The parchment.

1040
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,400
It was of no importance.

1041
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:11,100
The cylinder is
very interesting.

1042
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,600
We will find
the Golden Army here.

1043
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:23,700
As for the crown piece,
I know it's here.

1044
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,600
I can feel that
much from you.

1045
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:33,800
Father always tried so hard
to shield your heart from mine.

1046
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:40,400
But it's in one of the books,
and I will find it.

1047
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,000
Blue.

1048
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:45,100
You always look
so beautiful in blue.

1049
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:47,700
Blue.

1050
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:50,900
Poetry. "Love.

1051
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,700
"Found then lost."

1052
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,700
Only words.
I will find it.

1053
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,200
Listen, listen, Red.

1054
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:05,700
I know what's
going on with Liz.

1055
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,200
Red.

1056
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:08,800
Abe.

1057
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,400
I'm sorry.
He has to know.

1058
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:12,600
Abe!

1059
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,000
Know what?

1060
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,700
Why?

1061
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,600
Stay back.
I'll go first.

1062
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:26,200
Abraham. No, don't...
He'll kill you.

1063
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,600
Princess?

1064
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:29,000
Abraham?

1065
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,400
No!

1066
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,300
I will kill you, Abraham.

1067
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:38,200
And anyone else
if that is necessary.

1068
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,700
Well?

1069
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:48,000
Then why don't you just start
with me, Your Royal Assness?

1070
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1071
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,900
Who put those there?

1072
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,600
And your weapon of choice?

1073
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:55,200
Five-fingered Mary.

1074
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,500
You move and I'll kill
your Abraham first.

1075
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,300
Red, you mustn't
harm the Prince.

1076
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:12,500
What?

1077
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,300
If you hurt him,
you hurt the Princess.

1078
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:19,000
You've gotta be kidding me.

1079
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,200
Will you give me
the crown piece?

1080
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,500
No.

1081
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,100
The piece.
No.

1082
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,400
Abe?

1083
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,700
Red, I'm so sorry,
but they're linked.

1084
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,000
What's going on?

1085
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:13,600
Red.
Liz.

1086
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:15,500
Red, behind you.

1087
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:21,000
You may have mused in the past,
"Am I mortal?"

1088
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,000
You are now.

1089
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:38,300
Abraham, many people
have died for this crown.

1090
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:41,700
He will, too.

1091
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:47,800
If you want to save him
and see her again,

1092
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:52,400
you will find the missing
piece and bring it to me.

1093
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:31,700
Jesus, Abe, pull the
damn thing out!

1094
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,000
I cannot.

1095
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:36,500
Every time I touch it, every
time I come close to it,

1096
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,500
it moves closer
to his heart.

1097
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,300
I don't know
what else to do.

1098
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,700
The wound will not heal
until the spear is removed.

1099
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,400
We're running out of time.

1100
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,300
Then we go after the Prince.

1101
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:52,900
And we make him
take it out.

1102
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:56,200
Hey, Liz.

1103
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:57,800
You were asking me.

1104
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:59,000
Don't talk.

1105
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,600
No, no, let me tell you.

1106
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:02,400
I know what's important.

1107
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:05,400
It's you.

1108
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:06,900
Red.

1109
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,600
I could turn my back
on the world, all of it,

1110
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,500
as long as you stay with me.

1111
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,300
I'll stay with you.

1112
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:20,600
You're the best man
I've ever met.

1113
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
"Man."

1114
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,500
"Be near me
when my light is low

1115
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,000
" When the blood creeps

1116
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,000
"And the heart is sick and
all the wheels of being slow"

1117
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,300
The cylinder
yielded coordinates

1118
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:13,500
to County Antrim,
Northern Ireland.

1119
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:17,100
The Giant's Causeway.
Right about here.

1120
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:20,500
Great. So we know
where he is.

1121
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:21,600
What are we waiting for?

1122
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:22,800
We should get going.

1123
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:25,800
The Prince will demand the
crown piece, Agent Sherman.

1124
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,500
So we give it to him.

1125
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,000
Dr. Manning?

1126
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,700
I'm afraid it's not
as simple as that.

1127
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,600
Hold on here,
what are you saying?

1128
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:36,000
The Golden Army
must not awaken.

1129
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,800
So, what?

1130
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:41,200
You're just gonna let
him die, is that it?

1131
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:42,300
I'm sorry.

1132
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,800
We called Washington.
We have our orders.

1133
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:48,200
And what about you?
He saved your life.

1134
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,800
I know.

1135
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:54,900
I know this is
difficult for you, but...

1136
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,700
Well, I won't
let him die.

1137
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:58,500
Agent Sherman,
may I remind you

1138
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:01,500
that I am the leader
of this team.

1139
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,300
Oh, there's no doubt
about that, sir.

1140
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,300
That is what you
are, Dr. Krauss.

1141
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:09,300
And if ever you were human,
that time is long gone.

1142
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,700
What's wrong
with her?

1143
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:13,900
You want me to
call her back, sir?

1144
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,300
Let her go.

1145
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:16,900
I understand.

1146
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:19,700
What about you?

1147
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:21,200
You find anything?

1148
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,600
No. Nothing yet.

1149
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,200
Well, keep looking.

1150
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:25,600
Absolutely, sir.

1151
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:27,400
All of you.

1152
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:30,400
But don't worry, sir, we know
it's here, and we're gonna find it.

1153
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,600
When Tom Manning gets on
the case, things get done.

1154
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,900
They get done.
They get done!

1155
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:38,400
100%. I guarantee that.

1156
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:58,300
Even without the piece, we
have to get him out of here.

1157
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:01,200
We'll go to Antrim, and
we will find the Prince.

1158
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:02,500
Keep looking.

1159
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:03,600
I ask you, everybody,
keep looking.

1160
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:04,600
Abe.

1161
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,100
Just the two of us.

1162
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,600
Yes. Yes.

1163
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:14,500
Let's go.

1164
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,200
We need to leave now, before
they run our clearance upstairs.

1165
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,800
Guten Abend,
meine Freunde.

1166
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,400
Do you have authorization
to take that plane?

1167
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,900
You're not gonna
stop us, Johann.

1168
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:45,400
On the contrary,
I've been giving it some thought,

1169
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,500
and we should be able
to save Agent Hellboy.

1170
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:52,800
You say I'm not human anymore,
but you are wrong.

1171
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:55,600
I understand your
pain all too well.

1172
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,600
A long time ago,
I lost the woman I loved.

1173
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:02,200
And that was, in fact, the
source of my present misfortune.

1174
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,900
I will tell you
about it one day.

1175
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,900
But for now, the tactical
advantage is ours.

1176
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,800
Consider this, the Prince
lacks the crown piece

1177
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:12,500
and without it, his
army poses no threat.

1178
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,000
So we have clearance, then?

1179
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:17,700
Agent Sherman, Liz,
screw the clearance.

1180
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,400
We will take that plane!

1181
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,000
It should be here someplace.

1182
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:50,100
The entrance should be here.

1183
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:51,600
I don't understand.

1184
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,200
Perhaps there's
a mistake on the map.

1185
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,000
Hello there!

1186
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:04,700
I bid you welcome, strangers.

1187
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:06,300
How can I be of assistance?

1188
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,400
We seek safe
passage to Bethmoora.

1189
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:12,000
And what does a nice little girl
like you want in the nightlands?

1190
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:13,900
We are looking
for Prince Nuada.

1191
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,500
Him, I know.

1192
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,700
Trade me something,
and I'll take you to him.

1193
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,100
Here. I have a shiny belt.

1194
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,600
But I have no pants.

1195
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,700
Look, a wonderful
set of magic eyes.

1196
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,800
I already have binoculars.

1197
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:33,800
But I see something special,
something shiny underneath the bandages.

1198
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:35,400
I want that.

1199
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,100
No, you can't take it out.

1200
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:39,200
Not without killing him.

1201
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,400
Maybe I know someone
who can.

1202
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:44,200
Will you trade me then?

1203
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,200
All right.

1204
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,500
Very well.

1205
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,300
Keep going. Keep going.

1206
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,100
Oh, my God.

1207
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:37,300
You should have seen
this city when it was alive.

1208
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,100
What happened to it?

1209
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,100
Curse.

1210
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:44,500
As soon as the Golden
Army was stored here,

1211
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:47,000
a plague of silence
and death befell us.

1212
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:49,400
And the world left us behind.

1213
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:59,600
For a long time,
I alone dwelled in the dust.

1214
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:06,800
All right, little girl,
the two of you come inside.

1215
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:09,200
The rest of you,
wait out here.

1216
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,400
Hello, old friend.

1217
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:28,300
I have brought you visitors.

1218
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:34,700
And I have
a favor to ask you.

1219
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,500
I owe no favor to
you, goblin. Leave.

1220
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,500
But I have done
so much for you.

1221
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,800
I have brought
you many souvenirs.

1222
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:45,800
And he has something shiny.

1223
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:47,000
Red.

1224
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:48,200
Something mine.

1225
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:49,300
Red!

1226
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:57,400
Anung un Rama.

1227
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:58,500
You know that name?

1228
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:03,300
And yours.
Elizabeth Sherman.

1229
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,700
At last.

1230
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:17,800
I have been waiting for
you both many a winter moon.

1231
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:23,900
I am his death,

1232
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,900
and I will meet him
at each crossroads.

1233
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,900
Good. But when can I have
that which is mine?

1234
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:34,500
Can you save him?

1235
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:37,000
It is for you to decide that.

1236
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:39,000
It is all the same to me.

1237
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:44,200
My heart is filled
with dust and sand,

1238
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:48,600
but you should know
it is his destiny

1239
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,900
to bring about the
destruction of the Earth.

1240
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:00,400
Not now, not tomorrow,
but soon enough.

1241
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:10,500
Knowing that, you still
want him to live?

1242
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:23,700
So, child, make the choice.

1243
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:27,300
The world or him?

1244
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,100
Him.

1245
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:35,600
The time will come
and you, my dear,

1246
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:38,900
will suffer more than anyone.

1247
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,800
I'll deal with it.

1248
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,100
Now save him.

1249
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:47,700
It is done.

1250
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,800
I have done what I can.

1251
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:59,900
Now, give him
a reason to live.

1252
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:09,200
Hey, friend, what
about that which is mine?

1253
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:13,000
Don't forget about me.
What about me?

1254
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,400
Friend?

1255
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:25,800
Shiny.

1256
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:34,400
Listen to me, you big ape.

1257
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:38,600
You have to get up.

1258
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:43,200
You have to get up.

1259
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:48,300
'Cause you're
gonna be a father.

1260
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:07,800
I become

1261
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:11,400
father?

1262
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:26,400
Well, all this is
very touching,

1263
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:31,500
but if you still want to meet
Nuada, we have to leave now.

1264
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:33,400
Ready.

1265
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:42,800
Here we are.

1266
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,800
And there they are.

1267
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:50,200
Seventy times 70 soldiers.

1268
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,800
Sometimes I wish
I'd never created them.

1269
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:55,500
Bim-bam went the hammers!

1270
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,200
Whoosh went the furnaces!

1271
01:35:57,300 --> 01:36:00,900
And one of those fires
took my legs off, now.

1272
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,800
This is as far as I can go.

1273
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:06,400
I'm not very
good with steps.

1274
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:11,400
But if you're here to stop him,
the Prince, I wish you luck then.

1275
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:13,400
The Golden Army
must not awaken.

1276
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:14,700
Undo what we did.

1277
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:15,800
We will.

1278
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,300
You're here.

1279
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,600
So I assume you brought
the remaining piece.

1280
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,500
No. We didn't,
but we should discuss...

1281
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,800
I'm not addressing you,
Tin Man.

1282
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:45,000
Abraham.

1283
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:46,200
Abraham?

1284
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:47,400
My sister is well
as I promised, so...

1285
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,200
Abe?

1286
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:54,300
What the hell are you doing?

1287
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,700
You would do
the exact same for Liz.

1288
01:36:56,700 --> 01:36:58,400
Agent Sapien, no!

1289
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,200
I am Prince Nuada,
Silverlance,

1290
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:26,300
leader of the Golden Army.

1291
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:31,100
Is there anyone here
who would dispute my right?

1292
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:51,400
Kill them.

1293
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:52,500
But...

1294
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:55,500
He lied to us.

1295
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:01,100
Abe, old buddy, if we ever
get out of this, we gotta talk.

1296
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:30,700
Open wide!

1297
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,400
Industrable, my ass.

1298
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:24,800
Hey! Throw me a bone here!

1299
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:05,800
Oh, crap.

1300
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:11,000
Well,
I'm out of ideas.

1301
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:20,800
I got one.

1302
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:24,700
I challenge Prince Nuada

1303
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:29,900
for the right to
command this army.

1304
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:38,000
You challenge me?

1305
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:39,600
Who are you
to challenge me?

1306
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:41,200
You are nobody.

1307
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,500
You are not royalty.

1308
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:47,800
Yes. Yes! He is Anung un Rama,
son of the Fallen One.

1309
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:49,000
He has the right.

1310
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,900
A challenge must
be answered.

1311
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:56,000
Very well then.

1312
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:57,300
Red, please.
Red. Think about it.

1313
01:42:57,400 --> 01:42:58,300
Guys. Guys!
He will kill you.

1314
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:00,200
Don't do this, Red.

1315
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,100
Don't worry, babe.

1316
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:05,400
I'm not gonna kill him, Abe.

1317
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
But I am gonna
kick his ass.

1318
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Whoa!

1319
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:16,700
Red.

1320
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:19,300
Hey!

1321
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:29,000
Nice ride, huh?

1322
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,200
You jumpy, slippery bastard.

1323
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:13,700
I got you now.

1324
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:27,000
Kill me. You must,
for I will not stop.

1325
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,600
I cannot.
Sorry, pal.

1326
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,200
I win.

1327
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:33,400
You live.

1328
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:05,400
Nuala.

1329
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:35,200
The humans,

1330
01:47:37,900 --> 01:47:40,200
they will tire of you.

1331
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:42,100
They have already
turned against you.

1332
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:43,800
Leave them.

1333
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:48,000
Is it them or us?

1334
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:53,600
Which holocaust
should be chosen?

1335
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:08,700
I never had a chance
to tell you how I felt.

1336
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,700
Give me your hand.

1337
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:24,300
It's beautiful.

1338
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:26,700
We die

1339
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,600
and the world will
be poorer for it.

1340
01:48:45,700 --> 01:48:47,900
Nuala, my sister.

1341
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:32,900
All that power.

1342
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,700
Don't even think about it.

1343
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,600
No. No, it's nothing.

1344
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:27,500
I told you,
it's a dead end.

1345
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:30,300
What are you doing?
Go away.

1346
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:32,200
Check the belt locator.

1347
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:36,000
Check the belt locators,
over there.

1348
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:39,400
Over there.

1349
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:46,400
You, you took that plane without
an authorization, young man.

1350
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:49,100
Hey. Manning.

1351
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:51,300
Here to help as always.

1352
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:53,800
What's going on?
What's going on?

1353
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:55,800
I quit.

1354
01:50:56,700 --> 01:50:58,100
What? Are you serious?

1355
01:50:58,200 --> 01:50:59,600
Looks that way,
doesn't it?

1356
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:02,500
What's wrong with you?
You can't all just quit.

1357
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:03,900
Watch us.

1358
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:07,300
On second thought,

1359
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,600
I think I'll keep this.

1360
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:14,500
Come on. Come on!

1361
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:18,600
Johann, they can't do this.
Stop them.

1362
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:22,100
Dr. Manning, suck my
ectoplasmic schwanzstucker.

1363
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:24,200
So what you said before,

1364
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:25,600
about us living anywhere.

1365
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:26,800
Guys. Guys!

1366
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:29,000
Anywhere. You and me.
- Come on back.

1367
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:30,100
Let's find a place
in the country.

1368
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:31,400
I said come on back.

1369
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:33,500
Clean air.
Green hills.

1370
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:38,000
A yard with lots
of room to grow in.

1371
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:38,500
It'll be great for the baby.

1372
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:40,700
Babies.

1373
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:41,700
