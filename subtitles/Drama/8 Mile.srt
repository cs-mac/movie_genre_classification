Going backstage.
I'm in the battle.
You can't go backstage.

52
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:31,547
Come on, dawg.
I got a stamp on my hand.
You gotta go around front.

Yeah.

58
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:48,731
Okay, cool, Future.
But I think your boy
got a attitude problem.

59
00:03:50,274 --> 00:03:53,527
You a crazy motherfucker,
you know that, trying to
fight bouncers and shit.

60
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:55,529
The fuckin' guy's obviously
got somethin' against me.

61
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:59,033
I go to the bathroom,

Come here, man.

Where you going?
He hurled on his shirt.

67
00:04:12,338 --> 00:04:15,508

Yo! Get the fuck off me,
Cheddar.

Come on.

Our clique'll be on the map
after you whup some ass tonight.

71
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:26,936
Me and Janeane
just broke up.

72
00:04:26,936 --> 00:04:29,313
What, again?
And I left her the car.

73
00:04:29,313 --> 00:04:31,315
Oh, come on, Rabbit.

74
00:04:31,315 --> 00:04:34,109
Yo, she says she's pregnant.

75
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:37,613
She's gonna need the car
if she's pregnant.

76
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:40,783
I'm gonna need
a place to crash.

77
00:04:40,783 --> 00:04:44,495
- You gonna stay at your mom's?

78
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:47,289
Come on.

79
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:49,834
Yo! Can I get some fuckin'
privacy here, man?

80
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:52,962
All right.
Come on, man, come on.
Why?

81
00:04:52,962 --> 00:04:55,089
Yo, my bad, man.

82
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:59,134
Look, if something's going
to happen with this shit,

Hey, man, I feel you.

00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:13,983
You ready, baby.
I wanna see you rip

88
00:05:13,983 --> 00:05:16,151
It's time to let

89
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:19,280
Yeah, you, baby.
Three-One-Third.

How y'all feelin' about

Kind of mediocre love?

00:08:25,424 --> 00:08:29,595
Choke! Choke! Choke!
Choke! Choke! Choke!

147
00:08:29,595 --> 00:08:34,934
Choke.! Choke.! Choke.!
Choke.! Choke.! Choke.!

148
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:38,687
Choke.! Choke.! Choke.!
Choke.! Choke.! Choke.!

149
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:53,494
Fuck you, motherfuckers!
Fuck you!

150
00:08:58,457 --> 00:09:01,627
Yo,Jimmy.! Hold up.!

151
00:09:06,757 --> 00:09:11,554
Man, don't even worry
about it, dawg, a'ight?

152
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:14,139
I'll call you tomorrow.
I got to go back inside, a'ight?

153
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:17,017
A'ight.
Stay strong, my brother.

154
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:20,896
- Yeah.
- You'll rip 'em next time.

155
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:22,982
Yep.
Yeah, next time.

156
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:39,456
Peace out, Rabbit!

157
00:10:33,886 --> 00:10:37,848
What the fuck?
Oh, God.
Oh, shit, Rabbit.

158
00:10:56,951 --> 00:10:59,036
You okay, baby?

159
00:11:02,873 --> 00:11:07,962
Don't you think you should have
called or knocked first or something?

160
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:10,631
I mean--
The phone's disconnected.

161
00:11:10,631 --> 00:11:13,592
I know that, Rabbit.

162
00:11:13,592 --> 00:11:19,014
I got to get down to
the phone place tomorrow and--

163
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:22,434
- I been busy, you know?
- Rabbit, what the fuck
are you doing here?

164
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:25,187
How about knockin'?

165
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:35,239
Me and Janeane just broke up.
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

166
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:37,700
I thought you had a really
good thing goin' with her.

167
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,911
- She sleepin'
with somebody else?
- No.

168
00:11:42,454 --> 00:11:44,623
Yo, I got to work
in the morning, so--

169
00:11:44,623 --> 00:11:48,627
You and Future still,
um, at that Little Caesars
over in Warren?

170
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:51,881
No. I'm down in
New Detroit Stamping now.

171
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:55,092
Oh. Well, that's good.
What?

172
00:11:55,092 --> 00:11:58,470
He got fired from
a pizza place.

173
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,598
Yo. At least
I got a fuckin'job.

174
00:12:00,598 --> 00:12:02,850
Okay, stop it.

175
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,936
Only ex-cons and welfare moms
work at that plant, man.

176
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:11,275
Baby, are y-you stayin' here
for a while or what?

177
00:12:13,194 --> 00:12:15,362
Just for a couple weeks.

178
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:18,199
Got to save up enough
to get my own place.

179
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:20,201
Just like Bob Zurowsky.

180
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:23,662
You're plannin' on still living
at home, aren't you, Rabbit?
Okay.

181
00:12:23,662 --> 00:12:26,040
What a bunch
of fuckin' losers.

182
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,042
- Fuck you.!
-Jimmy.!

183
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:30,503
- What's your problem,
you little ingrate?
- What's your problem?

184
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:34,048
Don't kick my fuckin' clothes!
Don't fuckin'judge me, man!

185
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:36,884
Why don't you grow up?
Goin' around actin' like a punk.

186
00:12:36,884 --> 00:12:39,136
Motherfucker, what's up?
Stop!

187
00:12:39,136 --> 00:12:41,013
Fuckin' punk!
Stop it.!

188
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:44,975
Hey, Lily.

189
00:12:46,185 --> 00:12:49,063
Hey, baby.
What are you still doin' up?

190
00:12:49,063 --> 00:12:51,065
You woke me up, you know.

191
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:55,027
- Yeah, I'm sorry, baby.
- What'd I do?

192
00:12:55,027 --> 00:12:57,571
Let's go back to bed.
Will you sing to me?

193
00:12:59,073 --> 00:13:02,076
Yeah, of course I will.
Come on.

194
00:13:02,076 --> 00:13:04,703
# I know this girl #

195
00:13:04,703 --> 00:13:07,248
# Her name is Lily #

196
00:13:07,248 --> 00:13:09,834
#And it's past her bed #

197
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:12,086
#T-I-M-E #

198
00:13:14,255 --> 00:13:16,507
# She goes to sleep #

199
00:13:16,507 --> 00:13:19,802
#And she can just dream #

200
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:22,930
#And not have to be #

201
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,307
# ln a stinky trailer with me #

202
00:13:26,892 --> 00:13:29,270
# So when I feel blue #

203
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,147
# Don't know what to do #

204
00:13:33,107 --> 00:13:36,068
# I look at you #

205
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:38,070
#And I just say-- ##

206
00:13:42,658 --> 00:13:44,743
Good night, baby.
Go to sleep.

207
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:54,003
Rabbit, if you're gonna live here,
you have to get along with Greg.

208
00:13:54,003 --> 00:13:56,630
He started it.

209
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,300
You can't fuck this up
for me, baby.

210
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:04,972
You just can't.
Whatever.

211
00:14:10,311 --> 00:14:12,771
No milk.

212
00:14:12,771 --> 00:14:14,940
Yo, can I get a ride
to work in the morning?

213
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:18,152
Where's your car?

214
00:14:18,152 --> 00:14:20,279
I left it with Janeane.

215
00:14:29,163 --> 00:14:32,708
- You're gonna let me
borrow your car?
- Nope.

216
00:14:34,627 --> 00:14:38,672
It's your birthday present.
My birthday's not for two weeks.

217
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:40,758
I know.

218
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:46,514
But you're still
my little Rabbit, right?

219
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:49,058
I need to get to sleep.

220
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:13,666
Bunny.! What up, doe?

221
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:17,461
Heard about
you and Janeane, dawg.

222
00:15:18,754 --> 00:15:21,549
- Thought you
might be back home.
- This ain't my home.

223
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:24,176
Why you up so early?

224
00:15:24,176 --> 00:15:26,428
Up, man?
I ain't even been to bed, dawg.

225
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:29,849
I came to talk to you--
Yo, I don't got time to talk
right now. I'm late for work.

226
00:15:29,849 --> 00:15:32,893
Can you give me a ride?
My ma's got the car.

227
00:15:35,396 --> 00:15:38,649
Yo, don't tell nobody
I'm livin' back here, man.
All right, dawg.

228
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:41,735
What happened to you last night?
I heard you got caught out.

229
00:15:41,735 --> 00:15:43,779
People sayin'
some fucked up shit.

230
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:45,781
Yeah?
Yeah.

231
00:15:45,781 --> 00:15:47,783
Man, why you still goin'
to The Shelter, dawg?

232
00:15:47,783 --> 00:15:51,662
Ain't nobody down there
but a bunch of clowns who ain't
got deals and never gonna get deals.

233
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:55,457
You need to stay at home.
You know Wink's got ya.
Whatever, man.

234
00:15:55,457 --> 00:15:58,294
Look, I'm telling you, man,
I'm on my way.

235
00:15:58,294 --> 00:16:01,046
And I'm takin' you with me.
You're the franchise, baby.

236
00:16:01,046 --> 00:16:03,090
The franchise?
Yeah.

237
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,342
I'm takin' a fuckin'
bus to work, man.

238
00:16:05,342 --> 00:16:09,763
Look. I was just on the horn
with my man Roy Darucher.

239
00:16:09,763 --> 00:16:13,601
That promo guy?
Yeah. Now Roy's
all hooked up at 98.

240
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:16,437
So what's he need you for?

241
00:16:16,437 --> 00:16:18,564
What's he need me for?
Talent, dawg.

242
00:16:18,564 --> 00:16:20,566
And you know
that's my specialty.

243
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:24,570
I'm the one that tipped him
on Big O and got that fat man
out of flippin' burgers.

244
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:28,574
Roy liked what he heard,
split some cash out
for that nigga's demo...

245
00:16:28,574 --> 00:16:32,536
and-- boom--just like that,
Big O got himself a deal,
and it's all because of me.

246
00:16:32,536 --> 00:16:35,289
Roy paid
for Big O's demo?
Every penny.

247
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:39,793
If they thought Big O was hot,
wait till they get a taste
of B-Rabbit.

248
00:16:41,128 --> 00:16:44,840
I'm building an empire.
I'm taking you with me.
You're next.

249
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,635
A'ight.
I'll talk to you later.
A'ight.

250
00:16:47,635 --> 00:16:49,678
Call me later, dawg.
Okay.

Up.! Down.!

261
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:02,686
What up, Manny?
I know.
You was late today, Smith.

262
00:19:02,686 --> 00:19:04,980
It wasn't my fault.
My car wouldn't start.

263
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,858
It ain't never your fault.
I don't want to hear it.

264
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:09,902
I guess this probably
isn't the best timing,

265
00:19:09,902 --> 00:19:12,696
but I really need
some extra shifts, Manny.

266
00:19:12,696 --> 00:19:17,493
Are you shittin' me?
You just started working here--
Hey, Dutton.

267
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:20,996
Is he shittin' me?
What?

268
00:19:20,996 --> 00:19:23,916
You late again, Smith,
and you're fired.

269
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,210
I'm lookin' for
John Latourno.

270
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,963
I can take you.
I don't think so, Smith.

271
00:19:28,963 --> 00:19:31,215
Right this way.
Thank you.

272

# On the microphone
I drop bombs #

295
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:19,990
# Look at this car
Thanks a lot, Mom #

296
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,660
#Here, happy birthday, Rabbit #

297
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,912
# Here's a brand-new car
You can have it #

298
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:27,456
#A 1928 Delta #

299
00:21:27,456 --> 00:21:30,292
#The shit won't even
get me to The Shelter #

300
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:32,628
#And I can't even say
I'm from Motown #

301
00:21:32,628 --> 00:21:34,839
# 'Cause I'm back in the 8-1 -0 now #

302
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:38,217
# 'Cause I live at home in a trailer #

303
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:42,847
# Mom, I'm comin' home to you ##

304
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:45,349
Jimmy,
you know there's another
battle next week, right?

305
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:48,602
- And I don't want to hear shit
about it. I'm signin' you up.
- Man, don't.

306
00:21:48,602 --> 00:21:53,107
- Come on. You got to battle.
- Future, I'm not you, dawg.

307
00:21:53,107 --> 00:21:56,068
- Look at me.
- Listen, once they hear you,

308
00:21:56,068 --> 00:21:58,112
it won't matter
what color you are.

309
00:21:58,112 --> 00:22:00,114
Look, you win
some of these battles,

310
00:22:00,114 --> 00:22:04,535
Three-One-Third will have
all the street credit we need,
with you and me as the anchors.

311
00:22:04,535 --> 00:22:08,289
Yo, did you hear that,
uh, Wink has been talkin'
to that promo guy?

312
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:10,666
Yeah. I heard that bullshit.

313
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:14,170
- Look, Wink is scandalous, dawg.
- Could be a shot.

314
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,256
You know I'm tryin' to get
straight with the Lord,
my man up there.

315
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:21,468
So I don't really like
bringin' too much negative
toward my positive world.

316
00:22:21,468 --> 00:22:25,306
But Wink is just talkin' shit.
There'll be no action,just talk--

317
00:22:27,016 --> 00:22:29,685
# Sweet home Alabama #

318
00:22:32,563 --> 00:22:35,107
You got a cigarette?

319
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:45,910
- The dude mentally ill?
- Car accident, man.

320
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,038
He's supposed to get some big
settlement check soon or some shit.

321
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,791
Man, will you hurry up
with that thing?

322
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,254
- Yo, try it now.

323
00:22:57,254 --> 00:22:59,965
Give it some gas.

324
00:23:07,223 --> 00:23:09,266
That's what
I'm takin' about, baby.

325
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:11,352
Come on, man,
we goin' out tonight.

326
00:23:11,352 --> 00:23:14,605
Uh! Uh!
Yeah, tonigh--
Tonight?

327
00:23:16,148 --> 00:23:19,235
Look, fuck last night.
Okay? Forget it.

328
00:23:21,362 --> 00:23:23,364
What about gettin'
straight with the Lord?

329
00:23:23,364 --> 00:23:27,993
Come on, man, it's Saturday. I can
get straight with the Lord on Sunday.

330
00:23:30,871 --> 00:23:34,458
##
Oh, hey, "B", I got
these new beats, man.

331
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:37,419
You know how much I like
your moms and everything, "B"--

332
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:41,131
Shit. How much I really,
really like your mama, Rabbit.

333
00:23:41,131 --> 00:23:44,301
But she wasn't doin'you no favor
when she left you this car, man.

334
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:47,888
Fuck you.
Get out and walk.
At least the radio plays.

335
00:23:47,888 --> 00:23:51,392
##
What up with the whole
East Coast/West Coast thing?

336
00:23:51,392 --> 00:23:53,894
Word.
We got to put the Mo
on the map.

337
00:23:53,894 --> 00:23:57,147
Yeah. Talk about the 3-1 -3.

338
00:23:57,147 --> 00:24:00,109
Man, nobody even knows
Detroit is in 3-1 -3.

339
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:02,236
Three-one-three!
Three-one-three!

340
00:24:02,236 --> 00:24:05,114
What the fuck
you talkin' about?
You from 8-1 -0.

341
00:24:05,114 --> 00:24:08,868
Man, we just got
to make our own sound.
Fuck everybody else.

342
00:24:08,868 --> 00:24:10,911
Then we get us a deal,
go platinum,

343
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:12,872

and get all the bitches!

345
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:18,919
- All the ho's.
- Mmm!

346
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:22,047
Do you think
I have a big head?

347
00:24:25,718 --> 00:24:29,138
-
- Ohh! Ohh!

348
00:24:29,138 --> 00:24:33,601
- Oh, shit!
- Why'd you bring that
damn thing, man?

349
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:36,562
- Oh, man. Do it.!
-Shoot.! Shoot.!

350
00:24:39,273 --> 00:24:42,651
- Pinkeye, bitch!
- Let me see! Let me see!
Let me see! Let me see!

351
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:45,446
Let me show you motherfuckers
how to shoot something.
Let me show you.

352
00:24:45,446 --> 00:24:48,991
- Do it, do it, do it.

353
00:24:48,991 --> 00:24:51,035
Oh, okay, okay.
Here we go. Here we go.

354
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:53,245
Here it is. Here it is.
Here it is.

355
00:24:56,498 --> 00:24:58,667
Take the wheel, man.
Come on,Jimmy.
Come on, man.

356
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:01,712
Take the gas.
You got the gas.
Man, come on, Rabbit.

357
00:25:01,712 --> 00:25:04,673
Hey, Rabbit,
get back in the car, man.

358
00:25:04,673 --> 00:25:08,511
Hit the bus.! Hit the bus.!
Hit the bus.!

359
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:11,722
- Ooh!
- Oh, no!
- No.! Don't do that.!

360
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:16,352
Oh, shit, man!

361
00:25:17,728 --> 00:25:21,065
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

362
00:25:22,983 --> 00:25:25,694
- Oh, shit!
- Fuck!

363
00:25:25,694 --> 00:25:27,988
Toss the weed!
Toss the weed, Cheddar!

364
00:25:27,988 --> 00:25:30,866
- Toss the motherfuckin' weed!
- Throw it out!

365
00:25:31,992 --> 00:25:33,953
What the fuck you doin'?

366
00:25:33,953 --> 00:25:37,748
- The fuckin' car just died, dawg.
- Oh, come on, man.

367
00:25:37,748 --> 00:25:40,417
I told you stupid-ass niggas
not to be doin' that shit.

368
00:25:57,476 --> 00:25:59,812
That rifle ain't mine, right,Jimmy?
I don't want to go to jail.

369
00:25:59,812 --> 00:26:04,942
Shut the fuck up, Cheddar.
I'm fuckin' serious.
I get claustrophobic.

370
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:16,328
You were scared.
You were scared.

371
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:19,915
No, you were scared.
You were scared.

372
00:26:19,915 --> 00:26:22,960
Man, you know how many
abandoned buildings
we have in Detroit?

373
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,006
How are you supposed to
take pride in your neighborhood
with shit like that next door?

374
00:26:27,006 --> 00:26:29,008
And does the city
tear 'em down?

375
00:26:29,008 --> 00:26:32,678
No. They too busy
building casinos and taking
money from the people.

376
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:35,681
Shut your preachin' ass up.
Nobody care about that shit.

377
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:37,683
Did you care when
that crackhead raped
that little girl?

378
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:40,853
You think that would have happened
if he didn't have an abandoned house
to take her to?

379
00:26:40,853 --> 00:26:43,397
They caught him,
didn't they?
Yeah, they caught him.

380
00:26:43,397 --> 00:26:45,441
Dumb motherfucker
went back to the house.

381
00:26:45,441 --> 00:26:47,735
How stupid
could a nigga be?

382
00:26:47,735 --> 00:26:51,405
Yo, Rabbit. What's happening
under that hood, man?
It's just a short. Chill out.

383
00:26:51,405 --> 00:26:54,867
I ain't gettin' back in
that piece of shit.
It's a deathtrap.

384
00:26:54,867 --> 00:26:57,745
I think Jimmy's mom's
tryin'to kill him.

385
00:26:57,745 --> 00:27:00,456
Yeah. But she's
so goddamn fine.
Hell, yes.

386
00:27:00,456 --> 00:27:04,460
Don't be sayin'
shit about my mom
or my fuckin' car, man.

387
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,629
I hear everythin'.

388
00:27:07,755 --> 00:27:10,132
- He a ninja now?

389
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:12,968
Hey, Rabbit!
Okay, okay, okay.

456
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,455
- What you gonna do about it, faggot?
- Who you callin' a faggot?

457
00:31:09,455 --> 00:31:12,082
Don't play yourself, bitch.

458
00:31:12,082 --> 00:31:14,585
Hold on. Yo, Elvis.
You don't wanna step to this.

459
00:31:14,585 --> 00:31:17,880
You need to take that
white-ass rap shit of yours
back across 8 Mile.

460
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,008
Caught your choke act
at The Shelter last night.

461
00:31:25,471 --> 00:31:28,516
- Oh, shit!

462
00:31:28,516 --> 00:31:31,185
Hey, what you gonna do
about this, niggas?

463
00:31:31,185 --> 00:31:35,439
- Come on, man.
- No, no, no. Put the shit down.

464
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:40,236
- Come on, now!
- Pull out.! Pull out.!

465
00:31:40,236 --> 00:31:42,738
- Chill, man. Come on, man.
- Yo, yo. It's cool.

466
00:31:42,738 --> 00:31:44,698
Come on, now.
It's cool.

467
00:31:44,698 --> 00:31:47,826
- Yo, come on, man, let's go.
- Come on!

468
00:31:47,826 --> 00:31:50,704
I should fuck you up,
Cheddar.

469
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,254
What the fuck
were you thinkin', man?
"Fuck Tha Free World."

470
00:31:58,963 --> 00:32:01,549
You just said it.
##

471
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:05,678
Yeah, Hip-Hop Shop.
Leadaz ofTha Free World.
A'ight, dawg.

472
00:32:05,678 --> 00:32:07,888
Hey, Hip-Hop Shop,
Wednesday night.

473
00:32:07,888 --> 00:32:10,015
Come on down.
Come on down.

474
00:32:12,184 --> 00:32:16,522
Hey, girl, uh, it's gonna be
your only opportunity to blow
the both of us, baby.

475
00:32:16,522 --> 00:32:22,278
'Cause after we go platinum,
you won't be able to get
to me and Future.

476
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:24,697
And, uh, why do
they call you Future?

477
00:32:24,697 --> 00:32:27,950
See, I had a lot of names,
you know, the most conceited kind.

478
00:32:27,992 --> 00:32:33,163
I was, uh, Maximum Brimstone,
Godfather "D', Devastatin' "D',

479
00:32:33,163 --> 00:32:36,166
Big "D"--you know,
that has a double meaning to it.

480
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:38,752
But see, none of those
really worked for me...

481
00:32:38,752 --> 00:32:41,005
till I started hosting those battles
down at The Shelter.

482
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:45,301
One day, somebody said,
"You know what, man?

483
00:32:45,301 --> 00:32:47,761
You are the future
of hip-hop in Detroit."

484
00:32:47,761 --> 00:32:52,516
So you see, baby,
sometimes you got to find
your name and, uh,

485
00:32:52,516 --> 00:32:55,728
other times,
your name finds you.

486
00:32:56,979 --> 00:32:59,398
You want to
smoke some ganja?

487
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:02,693
See, that's our problem.
If we don't respect
our sisters, who will?

488
00:33:02,693 --> 00:33:05,863
Yo, we're doin' it
to ourselves.

489
00:33:05,863 --> 00:33:08,991
He's my brother.
He don't like pussy.

490
00:33:10,117 --> 00:33:12,995
Yo, Rabbit.
Teach me to write rhymes.

491
00:33:12,995 --> 00:33:16,498
That's the way
to get the ladies, right?

492
00:33:16,498 --> 00:33:18,542
Let me out.

493
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:20,920
Yo, yo, hold up.
Look, I'm sorry.

494
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,715
I didn't know Papa and L.C.
were on their bullshit until tonight.

495
00:33:24,715 --> 00:33:28,052
Look, man, you know I wouldn't
be messin' with them...

496
00:33:28,052 --> 00:33:30,679
except I'm promotin' a show with
them at the Hip-Hop Shop next week.

497
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:32,806
Those Free World bitches?

498
00:33:37,937 --> 00:33:40,564
You see that the fuck
I'm talkin' about,Jimmy?

499
00:33:40,564 --> 00:33:43,317
Look, man, they're
just one of the acts.

500
00:33:43,317 --> 00:33:46,695
Hey,Jimmy, if you want,
I'll step out, man.
You're my friend.

501
00:33:46,695 --> 00:33:48,989
I don't want you
bein' mad at me.
Man, do what you want to do.

502
00:33:48,989 --> 00:33:52,284
Yeah, do what
you want to do, dawg.

503
00:33:52,284 --> 00:33:54,370
Only respect, baby.
Let's go.

504
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:57,206
Respect yourself, sister.

505
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:03,003
Hey, don't you
ever shut up, man?

506
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:07,550
Why you got to push me?
Damn, Future.

507
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:10,636
Man, what the hell
is his problem?

508
00:34:10,636 --> 00:34:12,638
Future?
Yeah.

509
00:34:12,638 --> 00:34:16,141
- Thinks sometimes
you talk some bullshit.
- Who is he to say what's real?

510
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:18,561
Just 'cause he hosts
those battles?

511
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:20,646
Ain't thatJaneane
over there?

512
00:34:23,065 --> 00:34:27,152
- Oh, yeah.
- I thought she was pregnant.

513
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,783
- I'm out, dawg. I'll be outside.
- Yeah.

514
00:34:32,783 --> 00:34:34,743
A'ight.
A'ight, man.

515
00:34:34,743 --> 00:34:36,871
By myself.

516
00:34:53,095 --> 00:34:57,725
I'm gonna ask him.
Well, here's your chance, girl.
Go ahead.

517
00:35:05,691 --> 00:35:08,777
You'reJimmy Smith,Jr.
Yeah.

518
00:35:08,777 --> 00:35:11,363
My name's Alex.

519
00:35:12,615 --> 00:35:14,617
So did you find the guy
you was lookin' for?

520
00:35:14,617 --> 00:35:17,620
What guy?
The friend.

521
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:21,165
Yeah. That was my brother.
I was borrowing a car.

522
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:25,377
So... I hear you're
a real dope rapper.

523
00:35:25,377 --> 00:35:27,755
A dope rapper?
Yeah.

524
00:35:27,755 --> 00:35:29,757
Who told you
I was a dope rapper?

525
00:35:29,757 --> 00:35:31,967
You know, it's around.

526
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:35,888
If you're so dope,
what you doin' workin' over
at Dead End Stampin'?

527
00:35:35,888 --> 00:35:39,183
Your brother works there.
Yeah, my brother's a loser.

528
00:35:39,183 --> 00:35:41,143
What about you?

529
00:35:41,143 --> 00:35:44,355
I'm workin' at lntermezzo,
savin' up enough cash
to get out of this place.

530
00:35:44,355 --> 00:35:47,316
Well, busin' dishes is much better
than pressin' bumpers.

531
00:35:47,316 --> 00:35:49,527
I'm not gonna
be there long.

532
00:35:49,527 --> 00:35:51,695
Where are you goin'?
New York.

533
00:35:51,695 --> 00:35:54,365
I won this modeling contest
a couple of months ago.

534
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:56,534
One of the judges said
he could help me out.

535
00:35:56,534 --> 00:35:59,787
Just got to get
a book together.
What if he ain't for real?

536
00:36:00,746 --> 00:36:02,748
All I'm lookin' for
is a ticket.

537
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:07,795
Yo, Rabbit. You and your
new friend want to bounce
to an after-hours spot?

538
00:36:09,046 --> 00:36:11,173
Rabbit?

539
00:36:11,173 --> 00:36:13,259
Let me go ask my friends.

540
00:36:19,306 --> 00:36:22,726
So how'd it go?
Guys, why don't we go to
this after-hours club?

541
00:36:22,726 --> 00:36:26,480
So where we goin'?
Hmm? Oh. My house.

542
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,275
What about your mom?
Workin' nights now.

543
00:36:29,275 --> 00:36:33,195
This the after-hours spot?
Heck, yeah.

544
00:36:35,322 --> 00:36:37,825
Can some of us
ride with you?

545
00:36:42,663 --> 00:36:45,457
- Why do they call you Rabbit?
- He's fast and he likes to fuck.

546
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:50,504
- Oh, well.
- Get your hand off my balls!

547
00:36:50,504 --> 00:36:53,591
- Man, why do you be all ignorant for?
- Oh, shit!Jimmy.

548
00:36:57,428 --> 00:37:01,098
- What's the matter with you?
- My bad, you guys.

549
00:37:01,098 --> 00:37:05,519
So you signed anything yet?
Not yet, but but I'm workin'
on a little somethin' somethin'.

550
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:08,480
- Yeah?
- Yeah. He's gonna be courtin'
a demo at MCA soon.

551
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,483
- Really?
- Yeah, well--

552
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:13,319
If you really
want to seeJimmy flow,

553
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:15,779
make sure you come down
to the next battle at The Shelter.

554
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:18,032
Yeah.! He's the best.!

555
00:37:18,032 --> 00:37:21,785
- Shut up, Cheddar.
- When's the battle?
- Friday night.

556
00:37:21,785 --> 00:37:25,289
Yeah? Can I come?

557
00:37:25,581 --> 00:37:28,292
There's no way I'm fuckin'
battlin' next Friday, dawg.

558
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:30,544
You know damn well
you're gonna battle if she's there.

559
00:37:30,544 --> 00:37:33,255
'Cause you're gonna
want to be the man,
you know what I'm sayin'?

560
00:37:33,255 --> 00:37:37,927
All right, man.
Just don't fuckin' push.
Guess we all need to be pushed.

561
00:37:39,512 --> 00:37:42,681
Ha. My bad. I'm sorry.

562
00:37:42,681 --> 00:37:47,102
You gonna let him push you?
You could never catch me
and you never will!

563
00:37:47,144 --> 00:37:49,730
Out of my way,
freaky girl!

564
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,774
Wipe your feet!

565
00:37:51,774 --> 00:37:55,110
##

566
00:38:00,449 --> 00:38:02,910
You like?
Hmm?

567
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:06,455
She's getting out
of the "D," though.
Hey, bro, please.

568
00:38:06,455 --> 00:38:09,124
That's what they all say.

569
00:38:09,124 --> 00:38:11,418
Nah. I think she's different.

570
00:38:13,295 --> 00:38:16,090
Hey, man, that chick
really blew both you guys?

571
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,509
I'm a sinner,James.

572
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:21,595
Come to the church with me
in the morning, a'ight?

573
00:38:25,057 --> 00:38:27,977
Hey.

574
00:38:27,977 --> 00:38:32,231
Uh, I saw you talkin'
to Papa Doc in Chin Tiki.

575
00:38:33,232 --> 00:38:35,734
How you know him?
You mean Clarence?

576
00:38:35,734 --> 00:38:40,489
He went to Cranbrook
with Christine's brother.

577
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:43,367
Do you want to dance?
Not right now.

578
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:45,369
Fuckin' Wink, man.

579
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:49,582
Tryin' to keep us in division
with all that fake-ass,
Big Willie wannabe talk.

580
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:55,254
Shit wrong with a free demo.
Free comes with a dick
right up your ass,Jimmy.

581
00:38:55,254 --> 00:38:58,382
Three-One-Third is real.
The shit that Wink
is talkin' about is wack.

582
00:39:01,552 --> 00:39:03,721
I don't understand
why the media's not
all over this.

583
00:39:03,721 --> 00:39:07,224
It's just a matter of time
before it all happens again.
The city don't give a fuck.

584
00:39:07,224 --> 00:39:09,226
What the hell
is he talkin' about?

585
00:39:09,226 --> 00:39:12,021
That abandoned house where
that little girl got raped.

586
00:39:12,021 --> 00:39:14,648
What you call
"an attractive nuisance. "

587
00:39:14,648 --> 00:39:19,403
You better believe that place
wouldn't still be standing if it
was on the other side of 8 Mile.

588
00:39:19,403 --> 00:39:21,363
It could have
been Lily, Rabbit.

589
00:39:31,207 --> 00:39:34,335
Burn this shit
down to the ground.
Burn it down.

590
00:39:34,335 --> 00:39:36,670
- That's what I'm talkin' about.
- Okay, I got it.

591
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:41,217
Fuckin' yeah, man.
Let's burn this fuckin' thing down.

592
00:39:41,217 --> 00:39:44,887
- Let's go, Cheddar.
- This is the definition
of an attractive nuisance.

593
00:39:44,887 --> 00:39:50,392
- Hey, Rock.! Come on, Rock.
Let's burn this thing.
- Right behind you, man.

594
00:39:50,392 --> 00:39:53,103
- That's what I'm talkin'about.
- Yeah, baby.

595
00:39:53,103 --> 00:39:55,105
Could have sworn
I had some matches.
You got some?

596
00:39:55,105 --> 00:39:57,358
You got my lighter?
I gave it back to you.

597
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:00,319
- I got one.
- Wink,you got the lighter?

598
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:02,738
No!

599
00:40:02,738 --> 00:40:05,449
- Oh, shit! Get out!
- Run!

600
00:40:12,331 --> 00:40:14,416
Hey, what the fuck,
you guys?

601
00:40:14,416 --> 00:40:16,544
I'm out!
Fuck you, Cheddar!

602
00:40:44,238 --> 00:40:47,199
Hey, Rabbit, word!

603
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:52,538
Rah! Hey, I burned
the house down!

604
00:41:00,504 --> 00:41:02,590
#The roof
The roof #

605
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:06,594
# The roof is on fire
We don't need no water #

606
00:41:06,594 --> 00:41:10,514
# Let the motherfucker burn
Burn, motherfucker #

607
00:41:10,514 --> 00:41:13,601
#Burn ##
It's almost beautiful.

608
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:18,147
When I was little,
I used to want to live
in a house like this.

609
00:41:18,147 --> 00:41:20,691
You know, how it used to be.

610
00:41:20,691 --> 00:41:24,069
You live with your family?

611
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:27,698
I got out of there
as quick as I could.

612
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:31,327
Left home when I was 17.
What about you?

613
00:41:33,704 --> 00:41:37,249
Sort of the same.

614
00:41:43,214 --> 00:41:45,549
When you record a demo,

615
00:41:46,425 --> 00:41:48,511
I'd really love to be there.

616
00:41:52,097 --> 00:41:54,600
Alex.
Hey, girl.

617
00:41:59,313 --> 00:42:02,650
You're gonna be great.

618
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,487
I got a feelin' about ya.
Let's go, Alex.

619
00:42:08,656 --> 00:42:11,116
See ya.
See ya.

620
00:42:14,537 --> 00:42:17,206
Cheddar, bring your ass on.! Come on.!

621
00:42:25,339 --> 00:42:29,051
Doggone pesky mosquitoes.
Now, let's see.

622
00:42:30,094 --> 00:42:33,138
Oh, yeah.
And the mirror said--

623
00:42:33,138 --> 00:42:35,391
Shit.!
What's the matter?

624
00:42:36,976 --> 00:42:40,771
We're bein' evicted.
Goddamn it!

625
00:42:41,647 --> 00:42:44,400
Come on, Mom.
Not in front of Lily.

626
00:42:45,818 --> 00:42:47,987
I can't let Greg
find out about this.

627
00:42:49,738 --> 00:42:52,283
Fuck Greg.

628
00:42:54,118 --> 00:42:58,414
Okay.
I'm three months late.

629
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:03,169
We got 30 days
to come up with the money.
What do you mean "we"?

630
00:43:03,169 --> 00:43:06,630
If you're gonna live here,
you got to start chippin' in, Rabbit.

631
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:10,050
When's Greg gettin'
his settlement check?
Get the money from him.

632
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:12,261
No, no, I can't.

633
00:43:12,261 --> 00:43:15,181
He's gonna ask me and Lily
to move away with him.

634
00:43:15,181 --> 00:43:17,183
Someplace nice, real soon.

635
00:43:17,183 --> 00:43:20,686
I-I can't freak him out.
You got to stop
livin' your life like this.

636
00:43:20,686 --> 00:43:25,191
If you really cared about Lily,
you would get a job
and quit fuckin'around.

637
00:43:25,191 --> 00:43:28,819
I got to go.
Be late for work.

638
00:43:33,073 --> 00:43:36,827
What are you doin'
with your life that's
so great, Rabbit?

639
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:51,926
Wink's workin' on a deal where
I can get free studio time...

640
00:43:51,926 --> 00:43:55,054
to record my demo.

641
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:59,099
Yeah. Right.

642
00:44:00,476 --> 00:44:02,937
Bye, baby.

643
00:44:02,937 --> 00:44:06,148
#Alex Latourno
Hotter than an inferno #

644
00:44:06,148 --> 00:44:08,150
Up.!
# Hotter than
a crack house #

645
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:11,111
- Down!
- # Burn internal #

646
00:44:29,296 --> 00:44:31,799
Up.! Down.!

647
00:44:33,551 --> 00:44:38,305
I don't know why Manny's got to
give me so much shit all the time, man.

648
00:44:38,305 --> 00:44:42,059
Maybe it's 'cause you
keep giving him reason to.

649
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:44,645
Stick to the plan, man.

650
00:44:44,645 --> 00:44:48,357
Just do your work
and shut the fuck up.

651
00:44:51,026 --> 00:44:53,863
Up.!

652
00:44:53,863 --> 00:44:56,031
Down!

653
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:08,335
Why haven't you called?

654
00:45:08,335 --> 00:45:10,754
Janeane, I can't
talk about this here.
You're gonna get me fired.

655
00:45:10,754 --> 00:45:14,550
I'm your girlfriend.
No, you're
not my girlfriend.

656
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:16,802
We broke up.
I'll call you later.

657
00:45:16,802 --> 00:45:19,138
You just took off
without sayin' a word.

658
00:45:19,138 --> 00:45:22,725
At least I left you the car.
Was it 'cause I said
I was pregnant?

659
00:45:22,725 --> 00:45:26,520
Come on,Janeane.
I know why you said that bullshit.

660
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,856
You got to get out of here.
I didn't know
what else to do.

661
00:45:28,856 --> 00:45:32,568
Tell me why you left
and I'll leave you alone.
It's not you, okay?

662
00:45:32,568 --> 00:45:35,070
Janeane, it's me.
It's my shit. I had to go.

663
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,323
Why?
What are you running from?

664
00:45:37,323 --> 00:45:39,325
Nothing.
Would you just go?

665
00:45:45,414 --> 00:45:47,958
You know that everybody's
calling you a loser
from the other night?

666
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:51,170
- Who said that?
- Everybody's talking about it.

667
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:53,297
How you froze up
and got booed offstage.

668
00:45:53,297 --> 00:45:56,050
- Fuck you,Janeane. Go home.

669
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:05,851
- What was all that about?
- I'm sorry, Manny. It wasn't my--

670
00:46:05,851 --> 00:46:09,813
- It won't happen again.
- Good.

671
00:46:09,813 --> 00:46:11,982
Don't be bringin'
that shit around here.

672
00:46:13,108 --> 00:46:15,194
Now get back to work.

673
00:46:17,863 --> 00:46:21,158
Rakim was the first rapper
to get complex lyrics, man.
I give you Rakim, no question.

674
00:46:21,158 --> 00:46:24,328
But as far as beat and lyrics
go, Biggie is the bomb.
I don't believe this shit.

675
00:46:24,328 --> 00:46:28,040
Y'all gonna talk about
complex shit and then
leave out my man Tupac.

676
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,543
Fuck Tupac!
Fuck Tupac?
Nigga, you crazy!

677
00:46:30,543 --> 00:46:34,213
- Pac's the only lyrical
motherfucker out there.
- His shit do got emotion.

678
00:46:34,213 --> 00:46:36,423
What about the Beasties?
Man, fuck the Beasties.

679
00:46:36,423 --> 00:46:38,551
How you even gonna bring
the Beasties' shit in the mix?

680
00:46:38,551 --> 00:46:40,553
They bust
some serious shit.

681
00:46:40,553 --> 00:46:43,639
No. The white boys,
that's more like busters
on some serious shit.

682
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:45,641
I ain't gonna
be bumpin' no Beastie,

683
00:46:45,641 --> 00:46:49,353
but it's always easier for
a white man to succeed in
a black man's medium, right?

684
00:46:49,937 --> 00:46:53,315
Word up. That's true.

685
00:46:53,315 --> 00:46:55,818
Yo! Whoa!

686
00:46:55,901 --> 00:46:58,404
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.!
-All right.

687
00:46:58,904 --> 00:47:00,614
What you doin', man?
Rabbit!

688
00:47:02,449 --> 00:47:07,037
- Oh, shit.!
- Don't you worry, Rabbit.
I got your back.

689
00:47:12,209 --> 00:47:14,879
Hey. Hey, what's up, "B"?

690
00:47:14,879 --> 00:47:18,382
- You wanna fuck with us, bitch?
- Shut your bitch-ass up.

691
00:47:18,382 --> 00:47:21,468
-
- Get off my man!

692
00:47:23,137 --> 00:47:25,139
Yo, get off me, man.!

693
00:47:46,452 --> 00:47:49,663
Yeah! You wanna
fuck with us? Huh?

694
00:47:49,663 --> 00:47:53,000
- Fuck with us, yeah?
- Cheddar, what the fuck
are you doin'?

695
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,921
- Where did you get that shit?
- It's my mom's.

696
00:47:56,921 --> 00:48:00,674
Man, put that shit away, dawg,
before you fuckin' kill somebody!

697
00:48:00,674 --> 00:48:02,968
- Papa Doc had one!
- Put it away!

698
00:48:04,929 --> 00:48:07,890
- Man, put that down, man.
- Come on, Cheddar.

699
00:48:10,893 --> 00:48:13,103
- Okay. All right.
- Fuck man.!

700
00:48:13,103 --> 00:48:15,397
- Oh, shit.!
- What the fuck?

701
00:48:16,941 --> 00:48:19,235
- Shit.
- Let's get out of here.

702
00:48:19,235 --> 00:48:21,028
You all right, man?
Oh, shit!

703
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:24,657
We got to get him
to a hospital, dawg.

704
00:48:24,657 --> 00:48:26,325
Keys?
Where are the keys?
Get the fuckin'car.!

705
00:48:26,867 --> 00:48:29,954
I got to put pressure on it.
I got to put pressure on it.

706
00:48:29,954 --> 00:48:33,707
- Try not to think about it.
- He shot his fuckin' dick off!

707
00:48:33,707 --> 00:48:37,169
Did I?
Man, shut the fuck up, man!

708
00:48:37,169 --> 00:48:39,547
Future,
take Gratiot to McDougall.
I live here too.

709
00:48:39,547 --> 00:48:41,590
I know how to get there.
Then fuckin' get us there then!

710
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:43,717
Rabbit's gonna teach me
how to write rhyme.

711
00:48:43,717 --> 00:48:46,011
What the fuck were you doin'
with a gun anyway, man?

712
00:48:46,011 --> 00:48:48,097
What the fuck were you doin'
with those motherfuckers?

713
00:48:48,097 --> 00:48:51,517
- You know I had
a show tomorrow night!
- Calm the fuck down!

714
00:48:51,517 --> 00:48:54,812
What are y'all trippin' about?
M.C. Bob.

715
00:48:54,812 --> 00:48:57,064
What?
M.C. Bob.

716
00:48:57,064 --> 00:48:59,149
Man, what are you
talkin' about?
Is that a good name?

717
00:48:59,149 --> 00:49:02,194
What's wrong
with Cheddar Bob?
I like M.C. Bob.

718
00:49:02,194 --> 00:49:06,407
Right?
Yeah. M.C. Bob.

719
00:49:06,407 --> 00:49:09,368
I'm the one that got that
fat man out offlippin'burgers.

720
00:49:09,368 --> 00:49:12,872
Really?
Yeah. Now Roy's gotta
interview him down atJLB.

721
00:49:12,872 --> 00:49:15,958
And I'm gonna be there.
Oh, it's finna be on.

722
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:19,378
So the doctor said
that he hit an artery,
but he's gonna be okay.

723
00:49:19,378 --> 00:49:22,631
Oh, yeah.
That's good, man.
Where you been?

724
00:49:22,631 --> 00:49:26,135
Prayin'.
Is he all right?
Yeah. It's cool.

725
00:49:26,135 --> 00:49:28,137
Let's go.

726
00:49:28,137 --> 00:49:30,681
Wink was just tellin' us how
he got in with Roy Darucher.

727
00:49:30,681 --> 00:49:32,766
Yeah. Shit's hot, man.

728
00:49:37,771 --> 00:49:40,566
He doin' an interview
down atJ LB.

729
00:49:40,566 --> 00:49:42,943
Why you even listenin'
to this clown?

730
00:49:42,943 --> 00:49:45,446
What?
You heard me.

731
00:49:45,446 --> 00:49:47,823
Clown.

732
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:51,660
Man, I don't even know why
you got to be all like that.

733
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,038
This is a good deal for him.
This shit is for real.

734
00:49:54,038 --> 00:49:56,123
Oh. It's for real?

735
00:49:56,123 --> 00:49:59,919
- Like that time you said
your cousin worked for Dr. Dre?

736
00:49:59,919 --> 00:50:03,506
Or like that time you were
real tight with that intern
in Russell Simmons' office?

737
00:50:03,506 --> 00:50:06,050
-
- Or how about the time--

738
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:08,052
Man, shut the fuck up!

739
00:50:08,052 --> 00:50:10,179
Why you always
givin' me shit, man?

740
00:50:10,179 --> 00:50:13,098
I mean, is it because
I'm makin' moves?

741
00:50:13,098 --> 00:50:16,769
Or is it because your ass
is stuck hosting battles
for, like, two years?

742
00:50:16,769 --> 00:50:20,189
- You're a fuckin' loser.
- Who the fuck you callin' a loser?

743
00:50:20,189 --> 00:50:23,859
Chill, man! Chill!
How can you guys fight
about this shit now?

744
00:50:23,859 --> 00:50:26,278
I know what you're trying
to do with our group, bitch!

745
00:50:30,991 --> 00:50:34,620
Cheddar's layin' up
in the fuckin' hospital and
you guys want to fight about this?

746
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:37,164
So fuckin' stupid.

747
00:50:49,134 --> 00:50:51,220
Forget this car, "B."

748
00:50:52,555 --> 00:50:55,641
I'll give you a ride
to work in the morning.

749
00:50:55,641 --> 00:50:57,685
I'm afraid you've made a mistake.

750
00:50:57,685 --> 00:51:00,563
I don't have any
little colored girl in my class.

751
00:51:00,563 --> 00:51:02,773
Why, there's Sarah Jane.

752
00:51:02,773 --> 00:51:05,401
There's my baby.
You mean Sarah JaneJohnson?

753
00:51:05,401 --> 00:51:08,153
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Mrs.Johnson.

754
00:51:09,405 --> 00:51:11,949
Sarah Jane, baby,
I brought you--

755
00:51:15,077 --> 00:51:17,121
Sarah Jane.!

756
00:51:17,121 --> 00:51:22,084
Did you win at bingo tonight?
No.

757
00:51:22,084 --> 00:51:24,253
You record your demo yet?

758
00:51:25,296 --> 00:51:27,548
What happened to you?

759
00:51:27,548 --> 00:51:32,178
Cheddar Bob had an accident.
He's fine. I'm fine.

760
00:51:32,178 --> 00:51:34,638
You and your friends.

761
00:51:34,638 --> 00:51:37,266
Mom, don't start, please.

762
00:51:37,266 --> 00:51:39,351
It's been a long fuckin' night.

763
00:51:39,351 --> 00:51:41,437
Tell me about it.

764
00:51:42,897 --> 00:51:45,024
Me and Greg
are havin' problems.

765
00:51:45,024 --> 00:51:48,527
- He found out about the eviction?
- No.

766
00:51:48,527 --> 00:51:50,779
The settlement check
ain't comin'?
No, it's comin?

767
00:51:50,779 --> 00:51:54,867
It's comin'. It's our--
It's our sex life.

768
00:51:54,867 --> 00:51:57,536
Mom, I don't want
to hear this shit.

769
00:51:57,536 --> 00:52:00,331
I mean, it's good.
It's real good.

770
00:52:00,331 --> 00:52:04,168
But he just doesn't like--
Mom, I don't want
to hear this.

771
00:52:04,168 --> 00:52:06,754
Greg won't
go down on me.
Mom!

772
00:52:24,688 --> 00:52:30,319
Hey, Sol. You ever wonder
what point you gotta
just say, "Fuck it, man"?

773
00:52:31,737 --> 00:52:36,450
Like when you gotta
stop livin' up here
and start livin' down here?

774
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,372
It's 7:30
in the morning, dawg.

775
00:52:48,504 --> 00:52:51,131
Yo, thank your mom
for the car, dawg.
A'ight.

776
00:53:03,978 --> 00:53:06,063
# Man, I'm gettin'
so sick and tired #

777
00:53:06,063 --> 00:53:08,065
# Of fuckin' with this steel #

778
00:53:08,065 --> 00:53:11,277
#They only give us 30 minutes
to eat lunch and chill #

779
00:53:11,277 --> 00:53:14,280
#My body achin'
just to get a buck #

780
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,116
# I'm sick of eatin' this shit
off this fuckin' lunch truck #

781
00:53:18,284 --> 00:53:20,995
#Nasty-ass food
I'm in a nasty-ass mood #

782
00:53:20,995 --> 00:53:23,497
# I should have called in sick
Shit, I had somethin' to do ##

783
00:53:23,497 --> 00:53:26,667
# I can't believe I'm hearin'
all this ravin' and rantin' #

784
00:53:26,667 --> 00:53:29,879
# From Vanessa up here
at the New Detroit Stampin' #

785
00:53:29,879 --> 00:53:33,465
# You need to get your food
and take your ass back to work #

786
00:53:33,465 --> 00:53:36,427
#You're dreamin' if you think
them corny-ass raps will work #

787
00:53:36,427 --> 00:53:40,264
#Look at y'all
Standin'out here freezin'
like dumb fucks #

788
00:53:40,264 --> 00:53:42,933
# Rappin' away for food
off this raggedy lunch truck #

789
00:53:42,933 --> 00:53:45,436
# Who want what
Who pumped up
to get rolled up #

790
00:53:45,436 --> 00:53:49,315
# I spit venom
in every direction
Soak some up #

791
00:53:49,315 --> 00:53:52,568
# Look at this fat-ass nigga
Sloppy sucker #

792
00:53:52,568 --> 00:53:55,946
# You an ugly motherfucker
Your pop should have
wore a rubber #

793
00:53:55,946 --> 00:53:58,157
# Stop rhymin'
Keep your day job, Vanessa #

794
00:53:58,157 --> 00:54:00,784
# Next time, leave that bullshit
home on the dresser #

795
00:54:00,784 --> 00:54:04,872
#Speaking of dresses
Take a look at Paul the fruitcake #

796
00:54:04,872 --> 00:54:07,666
# When you travel you probably
pack panties in your suitcase #

797
00:54:07,666 --> 00:54:10,169
#Made out oflace
from Victoria's Secret #

798
00:54:10,169 --> 00:54:12,713
# lf ten men came in a cup
you'd probably drink it ##

799
00:54:17,718 --> 00:54:20,346
# Okay folks
Enough with the gay jokes #

800
00:54:20,346 --> 00:54:23,057
# Especially from a gay broke
bitch yourself, eh, loc #

801
00:54:23,057 --> 00:54:25,601
Who is this--
# His style is doo-doo #

802
00:54:25,601 --> 00:54:28,521
#You've worked here
longer than me and I get
paid more than you do #

803
00:54:28,521 --> 00:54:30,814
Serious, man.
# Dawg, take a seat #

804
00:54:30,814 --> 00:54:33,943
#What's this guy
standin' in line for
He ain't got money to eat #

805
00:54:33,943 --> 00:54:36,946
# Check this out
Yo,yo #

806
00:54:36,946 --> 00:54:39,615
#This guy cashed his whole check
and bought one Ho-Ho #

807
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:43,327
# Fuckin' homo, little maggot
You can't hack it #

808
00:54:43,327 --> 00:54:45,746
# Paul's gay, you're a faggot #

809
00:54:45,746 --> 00:54:47,998
#At least he admits it
Don't even risk it #

810
00:54:47,998 --> 00:54:51,627
- #This guy's starvin' to death
Someone get him a biscuit #

811
00:54:51,627 --> 00:54:54,088
# I don't know what
they told you, Mike #

812
00:54:54,088 --> 00:54:56,257
#You must have had them
cornrows rolled too tight #

813
00:54:56,257 --> 00:54:59,093
#This job, you wanna quit
But you can't #

814
00:54:59,093 --> 00:55:02,721
#You've worked at this plant
so long, you're a plant #

815
00:55:02,721 --> 00:55:05,766
# Look at your goddamn boots
For Christ sakes #

816
00:55:05,766 --> 00:55:08,811
- #They're startin' to grow roots #

817
00:55:08,811 --> 00:55:10,813
# On this mike you get faded #

818
00:55:10,813 --> 00:55:14,525
- #You look like a pissed-off rapper
who never made it #
- Ooh!

819
00:55:14,525 --> 00:55:16,443
# Hey,why you fuckin'
with the gay guy, "G" #

820
00:55:16,443 --> 00:55:18,487
#When really you're the one
who's got the H.I.V. #

821
00:55:18,487 --> 00:55:22,283
Ooh!
# Man, I'm done with this clown
He's soft #

822
00:55:22,283 --> 00:55:24,785
# Fuck it, I'll let homegirl
finish you off ##

823
00:55:27,538 --> 00:55:32,001
#A guy like you
would never get a real woman
You jackass, gojack off #

824
00:55:32,001 --> 00:55:34,253
# That's the only way you comin'#
Hey, lookin' for your brother?

825
00:55:36,005 --> 00:55:38,507
I was.

826
00:55:41,677 --> 00:55:43,804
Do you want to
do somethin' tonight?

827
00:55:43,804 --> 00:55:47,057
Are you askin' me out
on a date,Jimmy Smith,Jr.?

828
00:55:47,057 --> 00:55:51,979
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, I am.

829
00:55:51,979 --> 00:55:54,231
Why don't you
take me somewhere now?

830
00:55:56,817 --> 00:55:58,903
Come on.

831
00:56:05,701 --> 00:56:07,786
Where are we going?

832
00:56:09,371 --> 00:56:12,291
Bro.! We gotta start
that second pallet.!

833
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,567
You were so good outside.

834
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:47,321
- In line at a lunch truck?
- Yeah. And at the Chin Tiki
the other night?

835
00:58:47,321 --> 00:58:50,491
And that demo thing
with Wink?

836
00:58:50,491 --> 00:58:53,994
You're gonna get a deal soon.

837
00:58:53,994 --> 00:58:56,205
I feel it.

838
00:58:56,205 --> 00:58:58,999
You was in the parkin' lot
the other night?

839
00:58:58,999 --> 00:59:01,544
My friends think you're crazy.

840
00:59:01,544 --> 00:59:03,629
Yo, your friends
don't even know me.

841
00:59:10,553 --> 00:59:13,514
Man, ain't nobody here.

842
00:59:13,514 --> 00:59:16,392
I can't believe
they sent him home already.

843
00:59:16,392 --> 00:59:19,395
If you ain't got insurance,
the medical establishment
will fuck you up.

844
00:59:19,395 --> 00:59:22,690
Where the fuck else
would he be?
Just thank God he's alive.

845
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:26,402
No. Thank God he didn't
shoot his fuckin' dick off.

846
00:59:26,402 --> 00:59:28,654
That's why brothers need
to sign themselves a deal.
I'm tellin' you.

847
00:59:28,654 --> 00:59:31,574
Record labels supply niggas
with the benefits they need.

848
00:59:31,574 --> 00:59:34,660
Dawg, if we sign us
a deal, you can take
the motherfuckin' benefits.

849
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:38,706
We talkin' Bentleys and Benjamins,
not Blue Cross and Blue Shield.

850
00:59:38,706 --> 00:59:40,791
I don't give a fuck
about none of that.

851
00:59:40,791 --> 00:59:43,711
I just wanna hear
Three And A Third on the box,
know what I'm sayin'?

852
00:59:43,711 --> 00:59:45,713
One of them strong songs
on J LB, you know?

853
00:59:45,713 --> 00:59:48,591
We need to save that shit up,
put it into savings bonds.

854
00:59:48,591 --> 00:59:50,926
We can build
our own studio--
Savings bonds?

855
00:59:50,926 --> 00:59:53,179
Let me ask you
a question, dawg.

856
00:59:53,179 --> 00:59:55,931
How the fuck are we brothers?
We need fine bitches and phat rides,

857
00:59:55,931 --> 01:00:01,270
- No goddamn savings bonds.
- That's all we ever do, man, is talk shit.

858
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:03,355
"We need to get fine bitches
and phat rides!"

859
01:00:03,355 --> 01:00:05,941
"No, what we need to do is
put our money in savings bonds."

860
01:00:05,941 --> 01:00:08,152
"No, what we need to do
is get our songs on J LB."

861
01:00:08,152 --> 01:00:10,654
Man, shut the fuck up.
All of us never do shit about nothin'.

862
01:00:10,654 --> 01:00:12,990
We're still broke as fuck
and live at home with our moms.

863
01:00:16,035 --> 01:00:18,287
Yo, I'm outta here.
I'll catch you guys later.

864
01:00:18,287 --> 01:00:22,208
Man, get yo' mad, ramblin'
ass in the car!
Yeah.

865
01:00:22,208 --> 01:00:26,462
I hope you get a new ride soon.
Maybe for that
birthday trippin' ass.

866
01:00:26,462 --> 01:00:31,050
I'm gonna call yo mama,
see what I can work out.

867
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:34,386
- I got shotgun, Shabba.

868
01:00:34,386 --> 01:00:36,680
Nigga, get in the back, Farrakhan.

869
01:01:15,553 --> 01:01:19,265
Man, why you pretendin'
to be asleep?

870
01:01:19,265 --> 01:01:22,226
Yo, I seen you
out the window, Bob.

871
01:01:22,226 --> 01:01:24,645
I didn't feel like talkin'.

872
01:01:24,645 --> 01:01:27,231
Why not?

873
01:01:30,901 --> 01:01:33,070
I didn't want them
makin' fun of me.

874
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:36,824
Do you know what
I'm sayin, Rabbit?

875
01:01:36,824 --> 01:01:40,035
Yeah.
You do?

876
01:01:40,035 --> 01:01:43,205
M.C. Bob.

877
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:08,022
It's like you see
in the magazines and stuff?

878
01:02:08,022 --> 01:02:10,733
Without doubt.

879
01:02:10,733 --> 01:02:13,694
Hey, Rabbit.
Where ya been?

880
01:02:13,694 --> 01:02:18,699
You call him Rabbit, too?
I gave him
that nickname.

881
01:02:18,699 --> 01:02:21,160
Stop it.
N-No, I did.
When he was little,

882
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:24,872
he had buckteeth
and big ears--

883
01:02:24,872 --> 01:02:27,374
He was so cute.

884
01:02:27,374 --> 01:02:31,295
"Wike a wittle wabbit."
Right, baby?

885
01:02:56,946 --> 01:03:00,032
I got some good news--
You brought her
to my fuckin' moms?

886
01:03:00,032 --> 01:03:02,284
What the fuck?

887
01:03:02,284 --> 01:03:04,245
I invited her to my show.
She said we had to come and get you.

888
01:03:04,245 --> 01:03:07,039
What was I supposed to do?
Look.

889
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:09,208
I been helpin' Al find
a photographer for her book.

890
01:03:09,208 --> 01:03:13,045
All she keeps tellin' me is
how much she really likes you, man.

891
01:03:13,045 --> 01:03:16,465
Damn!
Now, check this, dawg.

892
01:03:16,465 --> 01:03:18,884
I heard from my man Roy today.

893
01:03:18,884 --> 01:03:21,470
Now, he's gonna be down
toJ LB tomorrow night.

894
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:24,056
Doin' an interview with
Big O and shit. So what?
So what?

895
01:03:24,056 --> 01:03:26,600
I dropped it! I told him
about your skills, man.

896
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,687
I said,Jimmy Rabbit's your man!
He said, bring him down...

897
01:03:29,687 --> 01:03:31,772
and let me see
what he can do.

898
01:03:31,772 --> 01:03:36,944
Look, man, if everything
goes well, you could be flowin'
down 54 Sound next week.

899
01:03:36,944 --> 01:03:39,321
Now, can you get
your shit together in time?

900
01:03:41,657 --> 01:03:44,326
Yeah.
I can do it.

901
01:03:47,246 --> 01:03:49,665
My bad, man.
Oh, no problem, dawg.

902
01:03:49,665 --> 01:03:51,709
Big time,Jimmy.

903
01:03:53,377 --> 01:03:55,462
Why'd you take off?

904
01:03:55,462 --> 01:03:59,717
I don't really live here.
So?
Why'd you take off?

905
01:04:00,593 --> 01:04:03,012
I just--

906
01:04:05,973 --> 01:04:08,142
I just--

907
01:04:08,142 --> 01:04:11,187
You don't have to be
embarrassed about
where you live,Jimmy.

908
01:04:11,187 --> 01:04:14,190
I don't live here!

909
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:16,275
What's up with you
and Wink?

910
01:04:16,275 --> 01:04:20,070
He's helpin' me
get my book together.

911
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:22,072
Usin' his connections.

912
01:04:22,072 --> 01:04:25,117
Same way he's
helpin' you out.

913
01:04:27,077 --> 01:04:30,623
So--

914
01:04:30,623 --> 01:04:32,875
You probably have to
stay home tonight, huh?

915
01:04:37,004 --> 01:04:40,841
Yeah, I should work
on some songs for my demo.

916
01:04:40,841 --> 01:04:44,678
Okay.

917
01:05:01,111 --> 01:05:04,657
##

918
01:05:06,659 --> 01:05:08,661
#Palms are sweaty #

919
01:05:10,663 --> 01:05:13,249
#Sweaty already,
moms's spaghetti, he's nervous #

920
01:05:17,586 --> 01:05:20,714
#Keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down #

921
01:05:22,216 --> 01:05:25,469
#He opens his mouth
Words won't come out #

922
01:05:28,514 --> 01:05:31,183
# The clock's run out #

923
01:05:34,478 --> 01:05:36,480
# Turnin'and turnin'#

924
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,985
# You only get one shot
One shot, one shot #

925
01:05:40,985 --> 01:05:43,821
# Opportunity-tunity lifetime #

926
01:05:43,821 --> 01:05:46,490
#Lose yourself
Lose yourself, lose yourself #

927
01:05:46,490 --> 01:05:49,785
# Turnin'and turnin'#

928
01:05:49,785 --> 01:05:52,413
# You only get one shot
One shot, one shot #

929
01:05:52,413 --> 01:05:57,168
# Opportunity-tunity lifetime, turn #

930
01:06:15,686 --> 01:06:18,647
You know your mom's
gettin' evicted?

931
01:06:20,024 --> 01:06:22,276
Says right here.

932
01:06:22,276 --> 01:06:24,820
"Tenant must vacate the premises...

933
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:28,032
due to non-payment of rent."

934
01:06:28,032 --> 01:06:31,160
You know about this?
Morning.

935
01:06:32,244 --> 01:06:35,080
Sweetie, you want some cereal?

936
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:39,668
I was just talkin'to your precious son
about this eviction situation.

937
01:06:41,086 --> 01:06:43,088
You plan on tellin' me
about this, huh?

938
01:06:43,088 --> 01:06:45,090
Oh, honey, th-that was
just a mistake.

939
01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:47,092
You're
a fuckin' liar.
Hey, man!

940
01:06:47,092 --> 01:06:49,929
No, no.
Stay out of this, Rabbit.

941
01:06:49,929 --> 01:06:52,348
It's okay, don't worry.
I'm takin' care of--

942
01:06:52,348 --> 01:06:54,725
- Don't!

943
01:06:54,725 --> 01:06:56,977
Fuck, man! What the fuck
is your problem?

944
01:06:56,977 --> 01:07:00,314
You don't touch my mother, man.
Just stay out of it.
Stay out of it.

945
01:07:01,607 --> 01:07:05,152
I'm out of here.
Can't go out with
someone like you.

946
01:07:05,152 --> 01:07:08,030
Are you gonna let him just
talk to you like this?

947
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:11,534
- With two homeless kids.

948
01:07:11,534 --> 01:07:14,245
Rabbit.!
Jimmy, no.! No.!

949
01:07:14,245 --> 01:07:18,916
Rabbit!Jimmy!
Jimmy, please!

950
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,378
Stop it!

951
01:07:22,378 --> 01:07:25,130
Stop it! Stop!

952
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:28,926
- Fuck you!

953
01:07:28,926 --> 01:07:31,387
- Rabbit! Don't!
-
- Fuck you!

954
01:07:31,387 --> 01:07:34,098
Stop it!
Stop it, Rabbit.

955
01:07:49,321 --> 01:07:53,242
Oh, my God. Lily.
Come here, baby.

956
01:07:53,242 --> 01:07:55,703
Come here.

957
01:07:55,703 --> 01:07:57,705
It's okay.

958
01:07:59,415 --> 01:08:02,001
Come here, baby.
Come here.

959
01:08:04,253 --> 01:08:06,505
It's okay.

960
01:08:08,215 --> 01:08:11,010
It's okay.

961
01:08:14,597 --> 01:08:17,516
It's over.
It's over, baby.

962
01:08:36,535 --> 01:08:40,164
Yo, what up, doe?

963
01:08:40,164 --> 01:08:45,669
Alex just called. I got
one of my friends to take pictures
of her when she gets off work.

964
01:08:45,669 --> 01:08:48,380
So she needs a ride.
You know, that's why she called.

965
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:50,716
- Yo, can you drive?
- I don't care. I'll drive.

966
01:08:50,716 --> 01:08:54,470
The others be here in a minute,
so's my uncle can drop 'em off
on the way to work.

967
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:56,722
Hey. I heard that
your battlin' tomorrow night.

968
01:08:56,722 --> 01:09:01,477
- I'm doin' what?
- Someone told me Future
signed you up at The Shelter.

969
01:09:01,477 --> 01:09:04,146
- Who told you that?

970
01:09:13,113 --> 01:09:15,824
-
- Yo, what up, dawg?
- What up, dawg?

971
01:09:15,824 --> 01:09:19,703
Wipe your feet, dawg.
I ain't gonna wipe any feet.

972
01:09:19,703 --> 01:09:22,581
Hey,

Workin', dawg.

973
01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:26,335
Yo mama.! Tell yo'moms
to hang all that shit up.

974
01:09:26,335 --> 01:09:29,255
Yo, did you sign me up
to battle tomorrow night
at the fuckin' Shelter?

975
01:09:29,255 --> 01:09:32,174
What?
You heard me. Don't play
fuckin'stupid with me, man.

976
01:09:32,174 --> 01:09:36,095
Did you sign me up?
Jimmy--

977
01:09:36,095 --> 01:09:39,640
You know Papa Doc won last week,
so he'll be defending his title.

978
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,309
You gotta try to take
that shit from him, man.

979
01:09:42,309 --> 01:09:45,062
You win battles,
you get respect--
I don't give a fuck, man!

980
01:09:45,062 --> 01:09:47,565
I'm sick of you
always thinkin' you know
what's best for me, dawg.

981
01:09:47,565 --> 01:09:49,608
You ain't my fuckin' father.
I'm a grown man.

982
01:09:49,608 --> 01:09:52,611
Look,Jimmy, I know--
LookJimmy nothin'.
Fuck you!

983
01:09:52,611 --> 01:09:55,531
I told you not
to fuckin' sign me up.
What the fuck?

984
01:09:55,531 --> 01:09:58,242
You wanna fight me now, huh?
Yo, you ain't the Future
of shit, bitch!

985
01:09:58,242 --> 01:10:00,619
You just
David fuckin' Porter.

986
01:10:00,619 --> 01:10:04,623
Hey, come on, fellas.

987
01:10:06,584 --> 01:10:09,962
You know what?

988
01:10:09,962 --> 01:10:13,757
Do what the fuck
you wanna do, man.

989
01:10:13,757 --> 01:10:17,344
'Cause I don't
give a shit anymore.

990
01:10:19,471 --> 01:10:21,473
I really fuckin' don't.

991
01:10:34,695 --> 01:10:39,116
So you comin'
toJ LB tonight?
I don't know, man.

992
01:10:47,124 --> 01:10:49,251
##
I look like crap.

993
01:10:49,251 --> 01:10:52,379
If we knew it was today,
I wouldn't have never
gone out drinking...

994
01:10:52,379 --> 01:10:54,465
after the show last night.
I could always reschedule.

995
01:10:54,465 --> 01:10:56,467
No, no, no, no, no.
I want to do it.

996
01:10:56,467 --> 01:10:59,178
Yeah. You want to do it?
I want to do it.
Yeah.

997
01:10:59,178 --> 01:11:02,097
When are we gonna see
this little pictorial
in a magazine, Alex?

998
01:11:02,097 --> 01:11:04,600
Pictorials for Playboy, fool.
In fashion, it's "editorial."

999
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:08,020
God damn, Frederick Douglass,
will you shut the fuck up?
It's for her book, man.

1000
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:11,148
- So she can get a job.
- That's one book
I'd definitely read.

1001
01:11:11,148 --> 01:11:13,150
That'd be the only one.

1002
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:16,278
##

1003
01:11:27,331 --> 01:11:29,834
Don't forget this.
Thanks, guys.

1004
01:11:29,834 --> 01:11:31,836
- See ya.
- Bye.

1005
01:11:31,836 --> 01:11:36,590
- # Can't keep runnin'away #
- Want me to come up?

1006
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:40,719
- That's okay.
- # Can't keep runnin'away #

1007
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:43,389
# Can't keep runnin'away ##

1008
01:12:01,156 --> 01:12:03,158
Mom.

1009
01:12:04,952 --> 01:12:08,372
Mom, come on.
Get up.

1010
01:12:08,372 --> 01:12:10,541
Come on.

1011
01:12:10,541 --> 01:12:13,460
Come on!

1012
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:15,504
Greg left me.
Yeah?

1013
01:12:15,504 --> 01:12:20,259
He left me.

1014
01:12:20,259 --> 01:12:22,261
Oh.
Damn!

1015
01:12:23,512 --> 01:12:25,139
Come on. Get up.
Hi, honey.

1016
01:12:25,139 --> 01:12:27,975
It's okay, Lily.
It's okay, honey.

1017
01:12:32,855 --> 01:12:35,858
His settlement check came in.

1018
01:12:35,858 --> 01:12:38,235
His settlement check came in.

1019
01:12:38,235 --> 01:12:42,114
And now that he's got money,

1020
01:12:42,114 --> 01:12:45,868
he can't be with somebody
like me anymore.

1021
01:12:45,868 --> 01:12:49,413
It's Thursday.
I got-- I got--

1022
01:12:49,413 --> 01:12:53,459
I gotta go to bingo.
Maybe he'll be there.

1023
01:12:53,459 --> 01:12:56,712
You're goin' nowhere.
Better off without him.
Stop it.!

1024
01:12:56,712 --> 01:12:58,881
Stop it.
It's your fault he left me.

1025
01:12:58,881 --> 01:13:02,593
You ruined it! You ruined it.
You fucked it all up for me.

1026
01:13:05,429 --> 01:13:10,434
Who's gonna want me now?
Who's gonna want me?
Where are we gonna live?

1027
01:13:10,434 --> 01:13:13,437
We don't have any money!
We don't have anything!

1028
01:13:13,437 --> 01:13:15,439
What am I gonna do?

1029
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:18,192
- What am I gonna do?
- What are you gonna do?

1030
01:13:18,192 --> 01:13:20,611
Lily's out there
by herself right now!

1031
01:13:20,611 --> 01:13:22,613
Why do you got to
be like this?

1032
01:13:22,613 --> 01:13:25,658
What did we ever do to you?
Get the fuck out of here.

1033
01:13:25,658 --> 01:13:28,202
Get the fuck
out of my house!

1034
01:13:28,202 --> 01:13:31,080
Get the fuck
out of my house.!

1035
01:13:33,874 --> 01:13:36,126
Come on, baby.
Put your coat on.

1036
01:13:38,254 --> 01:13:43,092
We're goin' next door, okay?
We're gettin' out of here.
Come on.

1037
01:13:43,092 --> 01:13:45,094
I love you--

1038
01:14:15,457 --> 01:14:17,418
What floor is J LB on?
Twenty-eight.

1039
01:14:17,418 --> 01:14:19,420
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1040
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:21,964
When we look at Big O,
what are we lookin'at, baby?

1041
01:14:21,964 --> 01:14:24,508
I'm givin'you poverty.
I'm givin'you the slums.

1042
01:14:24,508 --> 01:14:26,802
That's where I'm from.
So I put it all in the music.

1043
01:14:26,802 --> 01:14:30,014
I'm lookin' for
Wink Harris.
Who?

1044
01:14:30,014 --> 01:14:32,016
He's supposed to be here
with Roy Darucher.

1045
01:14:32,016 --> 01:14:34,226
Oh, I think they're
all down in Studio "B."

1046
01:14:34,226 --> 01:14:36,270
All right. Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

1047
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:39,106
I did anything for free--
anything for the exposure.

1048
01:14:39,106 --> 01:14:43,068
No doubt. Big "O, "big ups
and congratulations, playboy player.

1049
01:14:43,068 --> 01:14:46,906
You finally got your record on the radio.
How does it make you feel, man?

1050
01:14:46,906 --> 01:14:49,867
Oh, man, that's much love.
I want to thank you

1052
01:14:52,578 --> 01:14:55,956
I'm tryin'to put Detroit--
the east side, for sure-- on the map.

1053
01:14:55,956 --> 01:14:58,417

And we gonna do it for real.

1054
01:14:58,417 --> 01:15:02,588
We'll get a pipeline
to come through here, and
the industry'll look at us...

1055
01:15:02,588 --> 01:15:04,507
and they'll sign all of us,

1056
01:15:04,507 --> 01:15:06,675
Whoa, whoa--

1060
01:15:16,477 --> 01:15:18,521
Yeah, I did that, man.

1061
01:15:18,521 --> 01:15:20,689
I thought I recognized
your face, baby.

1062
01:15:20,689 --> 01:15:23,943
Stop it! Fuckin' stop it!
Please! Please stop.

1063
01:15:23,943 --> 01:15:26,153
Stop it.Jimmy, stop it!

1064
01:15:26,153 --> 01:15:29,782
-Jimmy--

in the game, baby?

1065
01:15:29,782 --> 01:15:32,493

01:16:53,407 --> 01:16:55,451
Hey, did you have fun?
Mm-hmm.

1077
01:16:55,451 --> 01:16:58,162
Yeah. I know.

1078
01:17:03,709 --> 01:17:06,879
##

1079
01:17:06,879 --> 01:17:11,258
Okay, baby. I want you to go inside.
I want you to lock the door, okay?

1080
01:17:11,258 --> 01:17:14,178
Listen to me.
Go inside, lock the door.

1081
01:17:14,178 --> 01:17:17,181

Okay.

1082
01:17:17,181 --> 01:17:20,184
Okay. Go.

Yo, what up, bitch?

You ready to get
knocked out, doe?

1086
01:17:32,488 --> 01:17:36,450
Wink said you lived
in a trailer with your mom.

1087
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:39,370
But we didn't believe him.

1088
01:17:42,665 --> 01:17:45,543
Come on, Elvis.
Get up.

1089
01:17:45,543 --> 01:17:47,586

01:18:32,256 --> 01:18:34,508

1098
01:18:43,184 --> 01:18:47,521
I could end your shit right now,
and nobody would even miss your ass.

1099
01:18:48,856 --> 01:18:51,817
No, no, no. No, no.
Don't do this.

1100
01:18:52,776 --> 01:18:55,487
Come on. He's done.

1101
01:19:01,535 --> 01:19:05,456
- Free World, motherfucker.

1102
01:19:10,544 --> 01:19:14,632
Don't forget to come
to The Shelter tomorrow night!

1103
01:19:14,632 --> 01:19:17,468
Yeah, see you down there
you li'l rabbit!

1104
01:19:46,413 --> 01:19:50,292
Jesus!
What happened to you?

1105
01:19:50,292 --> 01:19:53,504
I fell.
You fell.

1106
01:19:55,047 --> 01:19:57,383
I fell.

1107
01:19:59,552 --> 01:20:02,137
Come on in.
I'll make you something to eat.

1108
01:20:02,137 --> 01:20:04,598
What?

1109
01:20:04,598 --> 01:20:07,434
I'm your mother.
I want to make you
something to eat.

1110
01:20:07,434 --> 01:20:09,895
What's the big deal?

1111
01:20:25,286 --> 01:20:27,329
I thought you wanted me out.

1112
01:20:28,706 --> 01:20:32,668
You want
the fuckin' pancakes or not?

1113
01:20:33,752 --> 01:20:35,754
What's gotten into you?

1114
01:20:35,754 --> 01:20:38,966
We're not gettin' evicted.
Why not?

1115
01:20:38,966 --> 01:20:41,468
I went to bingo.

1116
01:20:41,468 --> 01:20:44,847
And I won!

1117
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:49,435
Thirty-two hundred!

1118
01:20:49,435 --> 01:20:53,314
- You're kidding me!
- Nope.

1119
01:20:53,314 --> 01:20:55,357
Our luck's finally changing
around here.

1120
01:20:59,403 --> 01:21:02,489
Did you mean what you said about
doin' that demo with Wink?

1121
01:21:08,537 --> 01:21:11,207
No.

1122
01:21:11,207 --> 01:21:13,375
I'm gonna do it on my own.

1123
01:21:18,422 --> 01:21:22,551
You know, Rabbit?
I think that's the best way.

1124
01:21:47,284 --> 01:21:50,996
Hey, Smith!

1125
01:21:50,996 --> 01:21:53,832
Hey! Smith!

1126
01:22:01,549 --> 01:22:05,010
Are you all right?
I fell down some steps.

1127
01:22:07,888 --> 01:22:11,934
You been doin' much better here.
You still want those extra shifts?

1128
01:22:11,934 --> 01:22:16,355
Yeah.
You got 'em. I need you
to work tonight. I'm a man short.

1129
01:22:17,231 --> 01:22:19,400
Tonight?
Is that a problem?

1130
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:24,113
No problem.
Good.

1131
01:22:24,113 --> 01:22:26,198
Go on.
Get back to work.

1132
01:22:30,995 --> 01:22:33,247
Hey, Manny!

1133
01:22:33,247 --> 01:22:35,708
Thanks.

1134
01:22:44,091 --> 01:22:46,260
What up?
Shit.

1135
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:49,346
Waitin' on this slow-ass ride.

1136
01:22:49,346 --> 01:22:51,682
What are you still doin' here?

1137
01:22:51,682 --> 01:22:53,851
Somebody called in sick,
so I'm just fillin' in.

1138
01:23:05,112 --> 01:23:09,408
She ain't waitin' on me.
I'll be back.

1139
01:23:21,504 --> 01:23:25,132
What do you want?
I wanted
to say good-bye.

1140
01:23:25,132 --> 01:23:27,551
I'm goin' to New York.

1141
01:23:27,551 --> 01:23:30,221
Yeah? And--

1142
01:23:31,889 --> 01:23:36,060
Can I give you a ride?
There's some things--

1143
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:40,481
No, I'm cool.
Workin' overtime.

1144
01:23:40,481 --> 01:23:43,442
Saving up for
something special?
Yeah.

1145
01:23:43,442 --> 01:23:45,945
Studio time.

1146
01:23:48,739 --> 01:23:51,283
Good.

1147
01:23:51,283 --> 01:23:54,912
Good for you.

1148
01:23:54,912 --> 01:23:58,874
I was hopin' to see you
at The Shelter tonight.

1149
01:23:58,874 --> 01:24:01,877
But if you're afraid--
I'm not afraid
of them guys.

1150
01:24:04,463 --> 01:24:07,258
I didn't say you were.

1151
01:24:09,552 --> 01:24:11,887
Bye.

1152
01:24:20,938 --> 01:24:25,860
Hey, Paul.
Would you mind covering
for me for a couple hours?

1153
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:29,905
Yeah, I can do that.
Thanks, man.
I owe you.

1154
01:24:30,281 --> 01:24:32,992
##

1155
01:24:40,165 --> 01:24:44,795
- Hey.! It's Rabbit.! Hey.!
- Come on, man.

1156
01:24:44,795 --> 01:24:49,049
Yo, Rabbit, wait up!

1157
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:55,055
What's up, man?
What the hell happened to you?

1158
01:24:55,055 --> 01:24:57,850
You straight?
Look at your eye.
Yeah, man. I'm fine. Come on.

1159
01:24:57,850 --> 01:25:01,312
Wink's sayin'you blew up
'cause Roy Darucher
wouldn't pay for your demo.

1160
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:04,106
He's also sayin' some crazy shit
about him and Alex.

1161
01:25:04,106 --> 01:25:06,150
We gonna jump
those guys again?

1162
01:25:06,150 --> 01:25:10,279
Fuck that.
I'm gonna battle 'em.

1163
01:25:12,698 --> 01:25:16,952
- For real?
- Yeah.

1164
01:25:25,294 --> 01:25:27,630
Damn.
Yo, you guys comin'
or what?

1165
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:31,592
##

1166
01:25:31,842 --> 01:25:35,012
Cheddar, I can rip you to
a shred of cheddar cheese.

1167
01:25:35,012 --> 01:25:37,014
There's not
a better M.C. than me.

1168
01:25:37,014 --> 01:25:39,517
I'm B-Rabbit, bitch.
Sting like a bee.

1169
01:25:39,517 --> 01:25:41,519
Float like a butterfly.
What am I?

1170
01:25:41,519 --> 01:25:45,689
So what if I cut a guy?
Did I s-s-stutter, guy?

1171
01:25:45,689 --> 01:25:48,317
Leave you punch drunk
From lunch truck to Shelter.

1172
01:25:48,317 --> 01:25:51,278
You never felt the wrath
of helter-skelter melt ya,

1173
01:25:51,278 --> 01:25:53,697
got the belt
for the welterweight champ.

1174
01:25:53,697 --> 01:25:55,991
You got in
with a fake stamp.

1175
01:25:55,991 --> 01:25:59,787
Garbage bag full of clothes,
still pullin' ho's.

1176
01:25:59,787 --> 01:26:03,332
Rip you from head to toe,
from leg to bullet hole.

1177
01:26:03,332 --> 01:26:06,585
Next gun, pull it slow.
And aim at Tha Free World
'fore you let it go.

1178
01:26:06,585 --> 01:26:09,880
Instead of,
"Oh! I just shot my dick head."

1179
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:12,925
And yes, you do got a big head.
I can't call it.

1180
01:26:12,925 --> 01:26:16,887
Cheddar, where's your wallet?
You're so drunk, you can
out-drink the Alkoholiks.

1181
01:26:16,887 --> 01:26:19,890
Make 'em say,
"Damn! Cheddar's the man.

1182
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:22,893
He needs a can
surgically removed
from his hand--"

1183
01:26:27,857 --> 01:26:31,443
You again? It look like a fuckin'
handicap convention in here.

1184
01:26:31,443 --> 01:26:35,531
- Bunch of crippled motherfuckers.

1185
01:26:46,417 --> 01:26:49,211
Hey,yo.

01:27:01,599 --> 01:27:04,685
Yo, I need to get
some privacy, guys.

1188
01:27:06,854 --> 01:27:09,190
Can I come?

1189
01:27:12,443 --> 01:27:13,903
##

1190
01:27:13,903 --> 01:27:17,865
Hey, man.

I apologize--
Stop it.
Don't do it.

- Thank you.

01:28:19,844 --> 01:28:24,348
Yo, "B." They're callin' your name.
You drew Lyckety-Splyt in the first round.

1206

One of these cats

1214
01:28:50,499 --> 01:28:54,044
Trust me. If this shit is goin'where
I think it is, I might want to stick around.

Well, baby, you got

1234
01:29:47,223 --> 01:29:51,602
#You catch a bad one,
you better off shootin' yourself
with Papa Doc's handgun #

1235
01:29:51,602 --> 01:29:55,105
# Climbin' up this mountain
You're weak, I leave you
lost without a paddle #

1236
01:29:55,105 --> 01:29:58,067
#Floatin'up shit's creek
You ain't Detroit, I'm the "D"#

1237
01:29:58,067 --> 01:30:01,403
#You the new kid on the block
'bout to get smacked back
to the boondocks #

1238
01:30:01,403 --> 01:30:04,448

Take some real advice #

#This ain't Willie Nelson music #

1242
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:14,959
#Trailer trash, I'll choke you
to your last breath
And have you look foolish #

1243
01:30:14,959 --> 01:30:17,503
# Like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself
Silly Rabbit #

1244
01:30:17,503 --> 01:30:20,089
# I know why they call you that
'Cause you follow Future #

01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:25,094
#And when you acted up
That's when you got
jacked up and act stupid #

1247
01:30:25,094 --> 01:30:27,096
# Like Tina Turner
when she got smacked up #

1248
01:30:27,096 --> 01:30:29,306
# I crack your shoulder blade
You'll get dropped so hard #

1249
01:30:29,306 --> 01:30:31,433
#That Elvis'll start
turnin' in his grave #

1250
01:30:31,433 --> 01:30:33,811
-
- # Now I know why they left you
out in the dark #

1251
01:30:33,811 --> 01:30:37,022
#Take your white ass back across 8 Mile

01:44:15,716 --> 01:44:18,928
You and me

1458
01:44:18,928 --> 01:44:22,681
You know

1459
01:44:22,681 --> 01:44:25,059
Nah. That's you, dawg.

1460
01:44:25,059 --> 01:44:27,645
Come on.

1461
01:44:27,645 --> 01:44:29,647
Tell me you don't want
to host with me.

1462
01:44:29,647 --> 01:44:32,274
I mean, you have everybody

who you are--

1464
01:44:34,485 --> 01:44:39,156
Yeah, but...

1465
01:44:39,156 --> 01:44:42,159
I think I kinda need
to just do my own thing, man.

1466
01:44:44,203 --> 01:44:46,288
You know?

1467
01:44:46,288 --> 01:44:52,002
Yeah. I think I do.

1468
01:45:09,103 --> 01:45:12,231
A'ight, Rabbit.
Peace out, Rabbit!

1469
01:45:28,873 --> 01:45:31,166
##

1470
01:45:31,166 --> 01:45:33,711
Look.

1471
01:45:33,711 --> 01:45:37,965
#lf you had one shot #

1472
01:45:37,965 --> 01:45:40,593
# Or one opportunity #

1473
01:45:40,593 --> 01:45:43,387
# To seize everything
you ever wanted #

1474
01:45:43,387 --> 01:45:45,514
#ln one moment #

1475
01:45:45,514 --> 01:45:49,185
# Would you capture it
Orjust let it slip #

1476
01:45:49,185 --> 01:45:53,314
# Yo, his palms are sweaty
Knees weak, arms are heavy #

1477
01:45:53,314 --> 01:45:56,025
# There's vomit on his sweater already
mom's spaghetti #

1478
01:45:56,025 --> 01:45:58,694
#He's nervous but on the surface
he looks calm and ready #

1479
01:45:58,694 --> 01:46:02,865
# To drop bombs but he keeps on
forgetting what he wrote down #

1480
01:46:02,865 --> 01:46:07,369
# The whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but
the words won't come out #

1481
01:46:07,369 --> 01:46:11,081
#He's chokin'how
Everybody's jokin'now
The clock's run out #

1482
01:46:11,081 --> 01:46:15,711
# Time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality
Oh, there goes gravity #

1483
01:46:15,711 --> 01:46:20,174
# Oh, there goes Rabbit, he
choked, he's so mad but he won't
give up that easy #

1484
01:46:20,174 --> 01:46:23,260
#No, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's
to these ropes #

1485
01:46:23,260 --> 01:46:27,306
#lt don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so sad that he knows #

1486
01:46:27,306 --> 01:46:31,310
# When he goes back to this
mobile home, that's when it's
back to the lab again #

1487
01:46:31,310 --> 01:46:34,104
# Yo, this whole rap shit
He better go capture this moment #

1488
01:46:34,104 --> 01:46:36,315
#And hope it don't pass him #

1489
01:46:36,315 --> 01:46:40,945
#Just melt in the music
The moment you want it
you better never let it go #

1490
01:46:40,945 --> 01:46:43,822
# You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow #

1491
01:46:43,822 --> 01:46:46,534
# This opportunity comes
once in a lifetime #

1492

1494
01:46:55,042 --> 01:46:58,087
# This opportunity comes
Once in a lifetime
Give it up #

1495
01:46:58,087 --> 01:47:01,006
#Soul's escaping, through
this hole that is gaping #

1496
01:47:01,006 --> 01:47:04,176
# This world is mine for the taking
Make me king #

1497
01:47:04,176 --> 01:47:08,305
#As we move toward a
New World Order
A normal life is boring #

1498
01:47:08,305 --> 01:47:12,059
#But superstardom's
close to postmortem
It only grows harder #

1499
01:47:12,059 --> 01:47:14,687
#Homie grows hotter
He blows us all over #

1500
01:47:14,687 --> 01:47:19,024
#His ho's is all on him
Coast-to-coast shows, he's
known as the Globetrotter #

1501
01:47:19,024 --> 01:47:22,319
#Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home #

1502
01:47:22,319 --> 01:47:26,115
#He's no father, he goes
home and barely knows
his own daughter #

1503
01:47:26,115 --> 01:47:28,826
#But hold your nose 'cause
here goes the cold water #

1504
01:47:28,826 --> 01:47:31,745
#His ho's don't want him
no mo, he's cold product #

1505
01:47:31,745 --> 01:47:33,998
#And they moved on
to the next schmo who flows #

1506
01:47:33,998 --> 01:47:37,334
#He nose-dove and sold nada
And so the soap opera #

1507
01:47:37,334 --> 01:47:40,045
#ls told, it unfolds
I suppose it's old, partner #

1508
01:47:40,045 --> 01:47:43,299
#But the beat goes on
Dah-da-dum, da-dum da-dah #

1509
01:47:43,299 --> 01:47:47,845
#Lose yourself in the music

Tear this motherfuckin'roof off #

1517

I was playin'in the beginning #

1518
