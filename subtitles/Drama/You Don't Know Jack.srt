How's it feel?

45
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,274
Like losing 138 lbs

Obitiatry, stan.
The doctoring of death.

What,

49
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,018
Really? I'm a doctor.
You want me exiled to boca raton?

50
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:30,155
Come on.Come on.
Planned death is gaining acceptance

51
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:31,790
All over the world.
Why not here?

52
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:33,792
Can we, for christ's sakes,
just play cards, please?

53
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:36,428
Because you can't put those
decisions in the hands of patients.

54
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:38,063
Well, whose hands are
we gonna put 'em in?

55
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:39,898
Doctoring's a healing profession.
I can't even--

56
00:05:39,932 --> 00:05:41,766
Doctoring's
a death profession too.

You know I love you, jack, but most of
your colleagues think you're a nut.

67
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:09,928
Retired means one is

155
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,785
But I cannot give you
the injection myself.

156
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,120
It's illegal.

157
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:32,357
But you can release
these solutions

158
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,593
On your own.

159
00:10:37,296 --> 00:10:40,231
The saline drip is gonna

160
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,101
Activate the thiopental.

161
00:10:43,135 --> 00:10:45,370
This is gonna
put you to sleep

162
00:10:45,404 --> 00:10:47,438
<i>And set off this timer.</i>

163
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:52,276
You'll fall
into a deep coma

164
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:56,314
As the lethal dose of
potassium chloride

165
00:10:56,348 --> 00:10:58,282
Stops your heart.

166
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:02,387
Uh, I know you have
no motor skills,

167
00:11:02,421 --> 00:11:05,189
So I added this.

168
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:11,129
You can move you head
slightly side to side.

169
00:11:11,163 --> 00:11:13,598
Don't do it now, but
I'm gonna place this

170
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,266
Between your teeth.

171
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:19,437
Put it in
and move your head.

172
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:22,673
Very simple-- move
your head side to side

173
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,176
Just a little bit
and it goes.

174
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,980
- the time comes, you just let
your teeth do all the work.

175
00:11:29,014 --> 00:11:32,150
- ( alarm beeping ) -
this is outrageous.

176
00:11:32,184 --> 00:11:34,152
- Jack: No it's not.
- Get that thing out of here now.

177
00:11:34,186 --> 00:11:36,187
- He's just receiving new information...
- Jack.

178
00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:39,824
...So he's bound to react.
Just give him a chance to calm himself.

179
00:11:39,858 --> 00:11:41,826
Could you just give him a
chance to calm himself?

180
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,028
Please leave immediately
of I'll call security

181
00:11:44,063 --> 00:11:45,863
<i>And have you thrown out.</i>

182
00:11:45,898 --> 00:11:48,466
<i>- Please leave.
- I'm sorry, david.</i>

183
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,835
I don't need
your security.

184
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:53,171
- Certainly don't need that.
- Get it out of here.

185
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:55,039
David, I'm sorry
for this upset.

186
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:56,974
<i>Man:
Doctor, please.</i>

187
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,544
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Man: And take that thing with you.</i>

188
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:08,286
<i>Lessenberry: It took a
couple more months,</i>

189
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,722
<i>But the doctors finally did allow him
to be taken off of life support.</i>

190
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:13,224
And what
a brutal way he went.

191
00:12:13,258 --> 00:12:16,260
- Brutal? - Brutal.
Think about it.

192
00:12:16,295 --> 00:12:18,930
Is it really any different
than what the germans did

193
00:12:18,964 --> 00:12:21,399
- In nazi germany?
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

194
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:23,101
- Hmm?
- Do you want me to print that?

195
00:12:23,135 --> 00:12:25,937
- Print what you want.
- We're talking about hospitals,

196
00:12:25,971 --> 00:12:28,139
<i>- Not nazis.
- Well, they do the same thing--</i>

197
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:30,208
Starving people to death.
They cut off their feeding

198
00:12:30,242 --> 00:12:32,176
And their water
and they let them die.

199
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:34,145
And it's all legal.

200
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:36,848
The United States supreme
court has validated

201
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,749
The nazi method
of execution.

202
00:12:38,784 --> 00:12:41,018
<i>( lessenberry laughs
) excuse me.</i>

203
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,888
You-- you obviously don't
approve of the current method.

204
00:12:43,922 --> 00:12:45,389
No, I don't.
Do you?

205
00:12:45,424 --> 00:12:48,392
Starving people to death?
No, I don't think so.

206
00:12:48,427 --> 00:12:50,361
It's inhumane.

207
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,463
If a person's
allowed to die,

208
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:55,500
Then you inject them--
painlessly, quickly.

209
00:12:55,534 --> 00:12:57,435
You don't let them
wither away.

210
00:12:57,469 --> 00:12:59,137
It's inconceivable.

211
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:00,972
It's unspeakable.

212
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:04,475
What would you charge
for this procedure?

213
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,014
You don't charge people

214
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:12,150
For mething like this, mr.
Lessenberry.

215
00:13:12,184 --> 00:13:13,818
What's wrong with you?

216
00:13:16,388 --> 00:13:18,956
You-- you've really got
some story here, doc.

217
00:13:18,991 --> 00:13:21,592
Don't be surprised if this
gets picked up nationally.

218
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:23,728
Is your turkey okay?

219
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,497
I don't like fat.

220
00:13:26,532 --> 00:13:28,666
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

221
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,542
Selfish bastard.

222
00:13:37,576 --> 00:13:40,144
You hog all the ink in
the detroit papers,

223
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,914
Now you're in "newsweek"

224
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,916
<i>And there's
nothing about me.</i>

225
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,417
<i>- Oh.
- What about me?</i>

226
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,953
Look at this.
Man.

227
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:51,856
"blunt and feisty, he's
the first american doctor

228
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,158
To advocate
physician-assisted suicide."

229
00:13:54,193 --> 00:13:56,194
They're gonna have to
take me seriously now.

230
00:13:56,228 --> 00:13:58,763
- You're not a local quack anymore.
- No no.

231
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,065
- You're america's quack.
- America's quack!

232
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:02,767
- ( laughs )
- look at this.

233
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,936
You earned it.

234
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,104
Congratulations.

235
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:10,708
- Neal, congratulations.
- "newsweek" magazine.

236
00:14:10,742 --> 00:14:13,444
So how are
we gonna celebrate?

237
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,447
Uh, you want
a glass of water?

238
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:20,151
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Great!

239
00:14:33,265 --> 00:14:36,467
<i>Jack: So when were
you first diagnosed</i>

240
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,102
With alzheimer's, mrs.
Adkins?

241
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:40,738
<i>Mrs. Adkins: About a
year ago I think.</i>

242
00:14:40,772 --> 00:14:44,442
It was
three years ago now.

243
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:48,145
Oh.
And what did your doctor say

244
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,115
- When he told you?
- Well, it was like a bomb.

245
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:53,918
He said
she had alzheimer's

246
00:14:53,952 --> 00:14:56,954
And it'd come to a point

247
00:14:56,989 --> 00:14:58,689
Where she wouldn't
be able to...

248
00:14:58,724 --> 00:15:00,424
( cries )

249
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:01,692
( exhales deeply )

250
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:03,728
- There is-- - ...D
ress herself.

251
00:15:03,762 --> 00:15:05,896
She wouldn't be able
to take a bath.

252
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:09,500
<i>Jack: What-- what are some of
the other fears you have?</i>

253
00:15:11,336 --> 00:15:14,071
That I wouldn't know
that this is my husband

254
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,376
And my children,

255
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,078
<i>Or "who am I?
"</i>

256
00:15:21,113 --> 00:15:24,915
<i>Jack: You're sensing
the loss of things.</i>

257
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,852
Loss loss
loss loss loss.

258
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,421
So let's talk
about that if you could.

259
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,925
What happened today,
for instance?

260
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,296
- What happened today? - You tell me.
I don't even know what happened today.

261
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:42,199
She went out
into the yard and then--

262
00:15:44,102 --> 00:15:46,237
What I could see was

263
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:48,606
She stood there
in the yard

264
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,176
And I could see
from behind her

265
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,212
That she didn't know
where she was.

266
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,682
She didn't know
to turn around,

267
00:15:57,716 --> 00:15:59,817
That was the bacdoor
of the hwuse.

268
00:15:59,851 --> 00:16:03,587
She didn't know that that was the
gate to go out to the street.

269
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:06,090
She just-- she didn't
know what to do.

270
00:16:06,124 --> 00:16:08,225
<i>Jack:
Mm-hmm.</i>

271
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,094
I don't remember.

272
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:12,430
<i>Jack on tv: When I
talked to your doctor--</i>

273
00:16:12,464 --> 00:16:14,432
<i>First of all, he would
hardly speak with me.</i>

274
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:15,833
<i>But when he did,</i>

275
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:17,635
What your doctor was trying
to communicate to me

276
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:20,438
<i>Was that you're not
imminently terminal.</i>

277
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:22,673
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I--I-- I understand.

278
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:26,110
<i>- And I understand-- - margo:
Should I make some tea for us?</i>

279
00:16:26,144 --> 00:16:28,779
<i>- Jack?
- Thats frightening.</i>

280
00:16:28,814 --> 00:16:32,249
<i>- Jack, do you want some tea?
- If I don't make this decision right now,</i>

281
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,385
<i>I'll never be able to.</i>

282
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:37,054
Margo, I don't know
what we're doing.

283
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:39,023
Look at her.

284
00:16:39,057 --> 00:16:40,925
Look at her.

285
00:16:42,394 --> 00:16:44,428
She looks well to me.

286
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:48,165
She looks
quite capable, no?

287
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,901
She's not
the right one.

288
00:16:50,936 --> 00:16:53,037
But she has the right.

289
00:16:53,071 --> 00:16:55,806
As a patient,

290
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:57,274
It's her choice.

291
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:59,176
I refuse to die
a slow death.

292
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:01,779
<i>Margo: Come on, jack.
You know how things are gonna be perceived.</i>

293
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,881
- I don't care.
- The media's gonna all over it.

294
00:17:03,915 --> 00:17:06,083
- I know. - You're gonna
have to tell her yes.

295
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:08,085
- I know.
- You have to be strategic.

296
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,054
Margo, what do we
care about the media?

297
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:11,922
<i>Who cares?</i>

298
00:17:11,957 --> 00:17:14,892
Look.
Sometimes in life

299
00:17:14,926 --> 00:17:17,194
There are strategies
that you have to take,

300
00:17:17,229 --> 00:17:20,097
Because we have to be very
careful about our purpose.

301
00:17:20,132 --> 00:17:22,700
- Our purpose is important.
- Well, what about her?!

302
00:17:22,734 --> 00:17:24,301
Who cares
what people think?

303
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:27,738
<i>It's what
my patient feels.</i>

304
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:31,108
She doesn't know each day
what she's gonna find

305
00:17:31,143 --> 00:17:32,977
When she looks
in the mirror.

306
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,746
She doesn't know if she's gonna
see herself there anymore.

307
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:37,915
<i>This is her terror.</i>

308
00:17:37,949 --> 00:17:41,152
This is what she goes through,
day in and day out.

309
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:44,288
The terror of being...

310
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:47,992
Lost.

311
00:17:50,796 --> 00:17:53,097
- Jack.
- She's running out of time.

312
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:55,232
I understand that.

313
00:17:57,235 --> 00:17:58,769
Look at me.

314
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:02,206
<i>If it was me,
if I was her,</i>

315
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,075
If I was in the same
situation, would you do it?

316
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,777
- You, margo?
- Yes, me, margo.

317
00:18:06,812 --> 00:18:08,312
<i>- Would you do it for me?
- Of course I'd do it. Yes</i>

318
00:18:08,346 --> 00:18:10,214
<i>- You would do it?
You know that? - Sure.</i>

319
00:18:10,248 --> 00:18:14,151
<i>If I saw the same look of
determination in your eyes</i>

320
00:18:14,186 --> 00:18:17,087
As I saw in hers,
of course I'd do it.

321
00:18:17,122 --> 00:18:19,557
No question about it.

322
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:22,460
My own sister--
in truth, I'd do it.

323
00:18:22,494 --> 00:18:24,228
<i>- You'd do it?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

324
00:18:24,262 --> 00:18:26,163
That's your answer.

325
00:18:26,198 --> 00:18:28,699
Yeah, I know.

326
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,235
I just wanted to work
this through, you know?

327
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:33,437
Just go through
the variables.

328
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:36,740

I think I'm gonna make
us some tea right now.

333
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:51,288
Make it strong,
will you?

334

Woman: Some people think we
brew up poisonous potions

339
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:08,172
Like witches
from gallows hill.

340

<i>Others think it's "take

Well, surprise surprise--

343
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:16,046
There's no such thing
as a hemlock pill.

344

We do not pull plugs.

350

We started this chapter

That to each person, their

I can carry
that for you.

That would've been nice, dr.
Kevorkian,

356
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:48,646
But it's a little late
now, don't you think?

357
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,481
And it's "missus.
"

358
00:19:50,515 --> 00:19:52,683
- Missus?
- Yup.

359

Oh.
Good.

360
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:57,321
So-- so you know
who I am?

361
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:59,123
What do I look like,
June cleaver?

362
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:01,158
What can
I do for you?

363
00:20:01,192 --> 00:20:03,494
Well, uh...

364
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:05,496
I, umm--

365
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,097
I have
my first patient,

00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:10,534
- But what I don't have...
- Is a place.

367
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:14,572
<i>- Yes. - And you'd
like to use my home?</i>

368
00:20:14,606 --> 00:20:17,908
<i>- ( engine starts )
- well, no.</i>

369
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:19,410
I thought
you would know a place,

370
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:22,413
But if I could use your home,
that would be just fine.

371
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:24,682
- Sure. - Well, if you're
gonna come to my home,

372
00:20:24,716 --> 00:20:26,750
You're gonna have to

How do you know
it's gonna work?

376
00:20:40,665 --> 00:20:43,200
Because I made it.

377
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:45,970
I wish you had a stronger
argument than that.

378

This first one,

382
00:20:56,748 --> 00:20:59,283
I want it
to be me and margo.

Or is it my...?

386
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:18,168
I've gotta remember to
install one by the couch.

387
00:21:18,203 --> 00:21:19,536
Your house.

388

But my husband ray-- he's
a retired police captain

395
00:21:41,226 --> 00:21:43,527
And he feels
very strongly

396
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:45,329
That we can't use
our house.

397
00:21:45,363 --> 00:21:47,197
<i>- He feels that it would put us at risk.
- Jack: Are you kidding me?</i>

398
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:49,199
<i>Lady, are you kidding me?</i>

399
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:51,268
I've got margo

<i>- You can't do this to me.
- Oh. Yeah, well,</i>

402
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:58,342
I could make
some other suggestions.

403
00:21:58,376 --> 00:22:01,445
There's nothing further to
be gained by talking to you.

404
00:22:05,216 --> 00:22:07,317
What now?

405
00:22:10,555 --> 00:22:12,890
Call the whole thing off?

Take me
to the airport shortly.

416

It's best for me
to go home,

He's going

Marigolds protect
the garden.

It's not too late, my dear.
You know?

Do you understand?
You wouldn't offend me.

- You need a lawyer.
- I don't know any lawyers.

464
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:47,024
There's this one guy I
see on tv all the time.

465
00:27:47,058 --> 00:27:49,960
You're gonna get him.

466
00:27:49,994 --> 00:27:51,928
He does these

467
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:55,132
Medical malpractice
commercials.

468
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:57,167
Is that a new wig?

469
00:27:57,201 --> 00:27:58,969
Yes.

470
00:27:59,003 --> 00:28:00,804
Why?
It's rum raisin.

471
00:28:00,838 --> 00:28:04,875
I think it makes me look
a little more fetching.

472
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,844
What do you think?

473
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:09,446
<i>Is that silly?</i>

474
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,448
I don't know.
I-- I don't know.

475
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:14,885
I don't understand wigs,
but that's just me.

476
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:17,120
One day, you know, I'm
going to turn around--

477
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:21,158
Girls, I don't think the
good doctor sways to fancy.

478
00:28:21,192 --> 00:28:23,794
- Hide the perrier.
- ( giggles )

479
00:28:25,563 --> 00:28:29,733
- This way.
- How good can this guy be

480
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:31,368
If there's
no elevators?

481
00:28:31,402 --> 00:28:33,870
Let me tell you something
about dick thompson.

482
00:28:33,905 --> 00:28:36,673
He may be a card-carrying
member of the religious right,

483
00:28:36,707 --> 00:28:40,110
<i>But he doesn't have a pot to piss
in, charging jack with murder.</i>

484
00:28:40,144 --> 00:28:41,478
He didn't kill anyone.

485
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:44,948
<i>Nullum crimen, nulla
poena sine lege.</i>

486
00:28:44,982 --> 00:28:48,185
- "no crime..." - "...
No punishment without law."

487
00:28:48,219 --> 00:28:50,654
<i>- Man: Yeah.
- The man knows his latin.</i>

488
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:53,890
( chuckles ) I also know
mcnally, the district judge,

489
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:55,792
And no way in hell is he
gonna let this move forward.

490
00:28:55,827 --> 00:28:57,994
<i>But understand, these
extremists will do</i>

491
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:00,864
Everything under the sun to
stop you from doing this again.

492
00:29:00,898 --> 00:29:02,732
They have no recourse
to stop me.

493
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:06,603
Did you videotape your
conversations with janet adkins?

494
00:29:06,637 --> 00:29:10,006
- Yeah.
- Yes, I did.

495
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:11,842
- Why? - Good.
Good.

496
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:15,011
Well, you see, courtrooms
are theaters of conscience.

497
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:18,248
<i>If we show your patients
pleading for your help,</i>

498
00:29:18,282 --> 00:29:21,751
If we lay out the gut-wrenching
emotions of it all,

499
00:29:21,786 --> 00:29:24,054
That's your
golden ticket.

500
00:29:24,088 --> 00:29:27,457
No jury will convict you
with me at your side.

501
00:29:27,492 --> 00:29:30,994
- I simply do not lose.
( chuckles ) - ( chuckles )

502
00:29:31,028 --> 00:29:34,798
He's a wolverine.
Wolverine.

503
00:29:34,832 --> 00:29:37,868
- Wow.
- Yeah, I was a theater major.

504
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:40,770
I did an unforgettable
giles corey

505
00:29:40,805 --> 00:29:42,539
In "the crucible"
senior year.

506
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,274
My mother ill has the
reviews in her pocket.

507
00:29:44,308 --> 00:29:46,176
<i>- Really?
- Man: Yeah.</i>

508
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,478
<i>- I can't afford to pay you.
- Man: Oh, you don't have to pay me.</i>

509
00:29:48,513 --> 00:29:50,080
<i>I'll do it for free.</i>

510
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:52,382
Let them keep trying to
prove this is a crime,

511
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,051
And we'll keep proving
it's a civil rights issue.

512
00:29:56,821 --> 00:29:58,822
So that do you think?

513
00:29:58,856 --> 00:30:01,091
She's a good judge
of character.

514
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:02,859
That's a wig
she's wearing.

515
00:30:04,028 --> 00:30:07,230
- Oh.
- Rum raisin.

516
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:10,500
- Jack.
( laughs ) - I like it.

517
00:30:11,636 --> 00:30:14,104
<i>- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</i>

518
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:17,307
<i>Jack: The-- "the
morning drive show"?</i>

519
00:30:17,341 --> 00:30:20,043
<i>Lessenberry: Yeah, he wanted me to ask
you if you'd come on as a guest.</i>

520
00:30:20,077 --> 00:30:23,547
It's on 6:00 to 10:00 in the morning.
It's got a big audience.

521
00:30:23,581 --> 00:30:25,715
You know, people driving
to work listen to it.

522
00:30:29,921 --> 00:30:31,955
He keeps it pretty light.
Well, I never heard of it,ord.

523
00:30:31,989 --> 00:30:33,523
But I'll do it, sure.

524
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:37,594
<i>âª black, white, red, brown,
feel the vibration...âª</i>

525
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:40,363
<i>Man: Good morning, everybody.
This is "the bob bender show,"</i>

526
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:43,066
"the morning drive show.
" today it's a special edition--

527
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,771
<i>It's "the morning die show," because of
my special guest, dr. Jack kevorkian.</i>

528
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:49,906
<i>He's a local boy from
here in "de-troit."</i>

529
00:30:49,941 --> 00:30:52,676
You might know him better as dr.
Death.

530
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:56,112
<i>I like to say he is the last
doctor you will ever need.</i>

531
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:59,249
I actually heard somebody refer to you as dr.
Frankenstein the other day

532
00:30:59,283 --> 00:31:02,852
<i>Because of your rather active
organ-procurement program.</i>

533
00:31:02,887 --> 00:31:05,488
Well, I'm gonna take
that as a compliment,

534
00:31:05,523 --> 00:31:08,425
Because anyone who's read
the story of frankenstein

535
00:31:08,459 --> 00:31:12,429
Knows that he was
a benevolent man

536
00:31:12,463 --> 00:31:16,299
And it was society who
made the monster bad.

537
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:18,802
<i>Bob: Well, I find it
impossible to believe,</i>

538
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:21,404
But our lines are lighting
up and my producer tells me

539
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:24,474
40% to 50% of our callers
say "heyyou're right."

540
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:27,777
So maybe I shouldn't go on.
Let's quit while I'm ahead.

541
00:31:27,812 --> 00:31:30,480
- Well, don't die on me now, doc.
- No no no.

542
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:33,416
Sorry, I had to say that.
Tell me a little bit about your mercitron,

543
00:31:33,451 --> 00:31:36,052
<i>- Something I hope the-- - see?
He's doing good.</i>

544
00:31:36,087 --> 00:31:39,589
- Yeah.
- Sharp as a tack.

545
00:31:39,624 --> 00:31:43,493
<i>Jack over radio: It's good that
people realize what's at stake here.</i>

546
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:46,429
I me,
self-determination is

547
00:31:46,464 --> 00:31:48,531
A basic human right

548
00:31:48,566 --> 00:31:51,368
And everyone
should have it.

549
00:31:51,402 --> 00:31:53,937
By flipping the switch
on your suicide machine,

550
00:31:53,971 --> 00:31:56,172
<i>- Kind of like hitting this button here.
- ( button clicks )</i>

551
00:31:56,207 --> 00:32:00,810
Well, sure,
or carbon monoxide,

552
00:32:00,845 --> 00:32:04,147
<i>Which actually is a
quicker procedure.</i>

553
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:06,016
<i>And I can assure you
as a pathologist</i>

554
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:09,619
Gas inhalation always
leaves the deceased

555
00:32:09,654 --> 00:32:12,188
With a rosy,
colorful afterglow.

556
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:14,691
<i>Bob: Well, hopefully our
listeners aren't listening</i>

557
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:17,727
In their garages this morning.
If they are, open the door.

558
00:32:17,762 --> 00:32:21,431
<i>( evil laugh ) we're getting
rather ghoulish here</i>

559
00:32:21,465 --> 00:32:25,168
<i>At 7:55 in the morning.
You are live with bob bender</i>

560
00:32:25,202 --> 00:32:27,203
And I hesitate
to say "ve," doctor,

561
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:29,873
Because we're talking death with dr.
Death.

562
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:32,575
And if you want to end it, call dr.
Kevorkian

563
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:36,646
<i>- That's k-e-v-o-r-k-I-a-n.

564
00:32:36,681 --> 00:32:38,581
<i>I just don't want to give
the wrong impression.</i>

565
00:32:38,616 --> 00:32:41,384
<i>I am not here advertising.

<i>- Hi, there.
- ( ratchet clicks )</i>

568
00:33:01,706 --> 00:33:03,340
Oh, no.
Not you, lady.

569
00:33:03,374 --> 00:33:05,675
- Oh, stop it. Stop it.
- Stay away from me, lady.

570
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,712
I don't bite.
I'm sorry I backed out on you that way,

571
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:10,914
But that's water under the bridge.
I think we need to have a conversation.

572
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,916
- Water under the bridge?
- Yeah.

573
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,019
I ended up using my v.
W. Van in the park.

574
00:33:16,053 --> 00:33:17,654
<i>Water under the bridge?</i>

575
00:33:17,688 --> 00:33:19,589
That was very
resourceful of you.

576
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:23,526
- Oh, thank you. - I know that you're
upset, but you have to let it go.

577
00:33:23,561 --> 00:33:25,628
We need to have
a bigger conversation.

578
00:33:25,663 --> 00:33:28,865
And that's
a much better sweater.

579
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:31,134
<i>It's more cheerful.</i>

580
00:33:32,236 --> 00:33:34,003
<i>( knife clinking )</i>

581
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:36,506
<i>Jack: You know, I don't get
many visitors up here,</i>

582
00:33:38,442 --> 00:33:40,076
Women especially.

583
00:33:40,111 --> 00:33:43,346
With your charms,
I'm shoed.

584
00:33:45,516 --> 00:33:47,317
I hope you like it.

585
00:33:47,351 --> 00:33:51,454
- I made it just for you.
- Thank you.

586
00:33:53,691 --> 00:33:56,793
You know, doc, you
have to stop pushing

587
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,561
For organ donations.

588
00:33:58,596 --> 00:34:02,632
It'd be better if you just
focused on one thing at a time.

589
00:34:03,868 --> 00:34:05,668
That sounds like
it comes straight ou

590
00:34:05,703 --> 00:34:08,805
Of the old
hemlock society playbook.

591
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:11,207
I'm the first to admit
hemlock has its faults.

592
00:34:11,242 --> 00:34:13,443
<i>That's why I'm here.
That's why I agree</i>

593
00:34:13,477 --> 00:34:16,546
That it should be self-determination
without compromise.

594
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,782
And for the record,
I also agree

595
00:34:18,816 --> 00:34:21,084
That "terminally ill"
is an undefinable term.

596
00:34:21,118 --> 00:34:24,587
So I say establish
your criteria--

597
00:34:24,622 --> 00:34:27,757
You know, multiple doctor
examinations, psych assessments--

598
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:32,362
Make sure that all physical
treatments have been exhausted

599
00:34:32,396 --> 00:34:36,332
And maybe the blessing of a
priest or a rabbi would be good.

600
00:34:38,436 --> 00:34:41,438
Funny. My mom used to make these
for us, only with a pickle

601
00:34:42,473 --> 00:34:44,040
And no crusts.

602
00:34:44,074 --> 00:34:46,009
Sorry about the crust.

603
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:48,178
I usually cut them off,

604
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:51,181
But somehow I thought
you'd like crust.

605
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:57,854
She was tortured in a nursing
home till the day she died--

606
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:01,291
Mind gone, bed sores the
size of dinner plates.

607
00:35:01,325 --> 00:35:03,893
If you looked in them,
you could see her spine.

608
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,764
Who was it for you?
Your mother?

609
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:10,333
Your father?

610
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:13,203
I don't see any pictures
anywhere of anybody.

611
00:35:15,372 --> 00:35:18,541
You know, maybe you're right,
what you said before.

612
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,779
One thing at a time.

613
00:35:25,716 --> 00:35:27,350
Fair enough.

614
00:35:27,384 --> 00:35:29,152
So, umm...

615
00:35:30,221 --> 00:35:32,222
I was snooping around
a little bit.

616
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:35,258
- Oh yeah.
- Can you tell me

617
00:35:35,292 --> 00:35:39,295
About marjorie wantz
and sherry miller?

618
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:43,399
Sure. Ms.
Miller has m.S.

619
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,301
<i>And she's had it
for a decade.</i>

620
00:35:45,336 --> 00:35:47,570
<i>She has hardly a
motor skill left.</i>

621
00:35:47,605 --> 00:35:51,274
<i>Her husband took off a month
after the diagnosis.</i>

622
00:35:51,308 --> 00:35:55,144
<i>And we've got mrs.
Wantz who has severe pelvic pain.</i>

623
00:35:55,179 --> 00:35:57,881
<i>She's had 10 operations,
all for naught.</i>

624
00:35:57,915 --> 00:35:59,749
<i>The pain's completely
debilitating.</i>

625
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:03,119
I've thought
about it a long time.

626
00:36:03,153 --> 00:36:05,321
A long time.

627
00:36:05,356 --> 00:36:07,257
Yeah, I have,

628
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:10,693
And I have no qualms

629
00:36:10,728 --> 00:36:12,695
<i>About my decision.</i>

630
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,564
<i>I could do it tonight.</i>

631
00:36:14,598 --> 00:36:17,033
<i>Jack:
What is it you want?</i>

632
00:36:17,067 --> 00:36:21,170
<i>- Put it in plain english.
- Yeah, I want-- I want to die.</i>

633
00:36:21,205 --> 00:36:24,841
<i>- Jack: That's plain enough.
- Yup. Yup.</i>

634
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:29,812
You don't wanna have one more
thanksgiving with your kids?

635
00:36:29,847 --> 00:36:31,814
No no no.

636
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:34,617
I just want it
over quick.

637
00:36:36,253 --> 00:36:38,221
I have no fear.

638
00:36:38,255 --> 00:36:40,456
<i>Marjorie:
I have tried, myself,</i>

639
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:43,059
<i>Three different times and
I have not succeeded.</i>

640
00:36:43,093 --> 00:36:46,462
I tried it,
as you know, with the car.

641
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:49,032
- Mm-hmm.
- I put the hose on the exhaust

642
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:50,733
And into the window.

643
00:36:50,768 --> 00:36:53,069
I stayed in the car
over three hours

644
00:36:53,103 --> 00:36:56,072
And I tried it three times.
Nothing happened.

645
00:36:56,106 --> 00:36:58,575
I get a half hour, an
hour sleep at night

646
00:36:58,609 --> 00:37:01,044
With all the pills and
slping pills I take.

647
00:37:01,078 --> 00:37:04,514
And it's--
when you've got no quality

648
00:37:04,548 --> 00:37:06,482
Of life left,

649
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:09,218
It's-- no.
No more.

650
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,655
If I do one of you,

651
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,592
There's a chance they'll
send me to jail.

652
00:37:15,626 --> 00:37:18,428
I won't be able
to dthe other.

- Right this way.
- Don't touch that.

No no no no no.
Sir, it's just him we want.

<i>- Man #2: Can you comment
on-- - this is ridiculous.</i>

680
00:38:28,966 --> 00:38:31,801
It's absurd.
No crime has been committed.

681
00:38:31,835 --> 00:38:34,771
Release him.
Release him now.

- Dr. Kevorkian!
- This better be live.

685
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:42,845
- Can we get your statement, sir?
- Two very sick

686
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,948
But wonderful women died here
tonight by their own choosing.

687
00:38:45,983 --> 00:38:48,785
Dr.
Kevorkian was only acting out

688
00:38:48,819 --> 00:38:50,687
As-- as--
as their physician.

689
00:38:50,721 --> 00:38:53,790
<i>He did not force anyone
to come up here.</i>

<i>Have the gall to charge dr.
Kevorkian tonight.</i>

692
00:39:00,064 --> 00:39:03,232
Bring it on!
Do it tonight!

693

00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:08,671
( softly ) don't let
them do this to me.

695
00:39:08,706 --> 00:39:11,974
( softly ) this is how you
play the media, jack.

696
00:39:12,009 --> 00:39:14,744
Get ready to become the most
famous doctor in the country.

697
00:39:14,778 --> 00:39:17,680
Isn't this murder?
Would you care

698
00:39:17,715 --> 00:39:19,415
To comment on the religious
aspects of this?

699

<i>Jack: I told you I'm not
gonna touch your food.</i>

It would be an admission
of guilt, you know?

707
00:39:59,456 --> 00:40:02,558
I can go for weeks
without food,

Come on.

I'm not moving.
I'm not paying that bond.

712
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:17,073
You don't have to.
I did.

713
00:40:17,107 --> 00:40:19,475
<i>- Come on, let's go.
- Jack: You didn't.</i>

714
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,878
You paid my bail?

715
00:40:21,912 --> 00:40:24,080
Yeah, I bailed you out.
Let's go.

716
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,550
What kind of lawyer
does that?

717
00:40:27,584 --> 00:40:29,552
<i>What the matter
with you, geoff?</i>

718
00:40:29,586 --> 00:40:32,355
Don't you see I'm denying
myself nourishment?

719
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:34,857
I'm-- I'm--
I'm starving to death

720
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:37,360
For three days
to make a point.

721
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:39,629
- I get it. I get it.
- This is a protest.

722
00:40:39,663 --> 00:40:41,631
They violated my rights.

723
00:40:41,665 --> 00:40:44,000
You're not supposed
to bail me out.

724
00:40:44,034 --> 00:40:45,835
It defeats the purpose.

725
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:47,904
Oh, I should fire you,
you know?

726
00:40:47,938 --> 00:40:51,974
We're facing an indictment

Pie.

730
00:40:58,816 --> 00:41:01,150
This is full of fat and sugar.
Are you trying to kill me?

731
00:41:01,185 --> 00:41:02,985
Just eat
the fucking pie, jack.

Oh, and another thing--

734
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,294
The state revoked
your medical license.

735
00:41:11,328 --> 00:41:14,664
Good. They took away
my career years ago.

736
00:41:14,698 --> 00:41:16,799
It didn't stop me,
did it?

737
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:20,136
Yeah, ll, it stops suppliers from
providing you with your poisons.

738

That's what
I've got neal for.

739
00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:28,044
Fieger:
Where the hell
are you going?

740
00:41:28,078 --> 00:41:29,579
Jack:
Home.

741
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:31,180
Well, come on,
I'll give you a ride.

742
00:41:31,215 --> 00:41:33,649
- My car's up here.
- No, I need the exercise.

743
00:41:33,684 --> 00:41:35,484
I need to get
the blood flowing.

744

We've got an offer

To do
the barbara walters show.

746
00:41:39,423 --> 00:41:42,558
Well, if barbara walters
wants me badly enough,

747
00:41:42,593 --> 00:41:43,826
She knows where
to find me.

748
00:41:43,861 --> 00:41:45,528
Don't make this
complicated, jack.

When heart transplants
first started,

There was the same

Even among doctors,
that it was wrong.

<i>Contrary to nature.</i>

763
00:42:57,734 --> 00:43:01,103
Isn't it
ghoulish to rip

764
00:43:01,138 --> 00:43:02,838
A person's chest open

765
00:43:02,873 --> 00:43:04,473
And take out a heart,

766
00:43:04,508 --> 00:43:08,477
Or a bypass opation?

767
00:43:08,512 --> 00:43:10,246
Ether is
the same thing.

768
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,915
You have ether, been
around for centuries--

769
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,917
It wasn't used,

770
00:43:14,952 --> 00:43:17,186
Not till 1846.

771
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,122
It was discovered in
1543, and before that

772
00:43:20,157 --> 00:43:23,659
Everybody was being operated
on while they were awake!

773
00:43:23,694 --> 00:43:26,529
Surgeons were cutting them
open while they were awake.

774
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:27,830
Did you know that, geoff?

775
00:43:27,864 --> 00:43:30,800
- No. - Oh, yes.
And you know why it was banned?

776
00:43:30,834 --> 00:43:33,602
Because of religious dogma.

777
00:43:33,637 --> 00:43:36,305
Because
of the foolish notion

778
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:40,409
That there's a god almighty
who wills us to suffer.

779
00:43:40,444 --> 00:43:42,178
Do you turn
patients down?

780
00:43:42,212 --> 00:43:45,348
I turn-- 97% to 98%

781
00:43:45,382 --> 00:43:48,084
Of the patients who contact
me, I turn them down.

782
00:43:48,118 --> 00:43:50,419
Should there be
second opinions?

783
00:43:50,454 --> 00:43:53,189
Always a second opinion.
A third opinion. ( chuckles )

784
00:43:53,223 --> 00:43:56,492
- But there wasn't in your case.
- No, there wasn't,

785
00:43:56,526 --> 00:43:58,494
Because no one
cooperates with me.

786
00:43:58,528 --> 00:44:00,363
What do you say
to people who say,

787
00:44:00,397 --> 00:44:02,798
"dr. Kevorkian, you
are playing god"?

788
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:05,267
I say to them,

789
00:44:05,302 --> 00:44:07,703
"so what?
" ( chuckles )

790
00:44:07,738 --> 00:44:11,207
<i>When a doctor gives you a
pill, he's playing god</i>

791
00:44:11,241 --> 00:44:14,477
Because he's interfering
with your natural process.

792
00:44:14,511 --> 00:44:16,912
All doctors believe
they're god.

793
00:44:16,947 --> 00:44:18,981
They shouldn't,
but they do.

794
00:44:19,016 --> 00:44:21,484
But I prefer that
than the doctors

795
00:44:21,518 --> 00:44:24,086
Who are more interested
in their stock portfolios

796
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:25,921
Than they are
in their patients.

Did you see the way
she looked at you?

799
00:44:31,762 --> 00:44:33,829
She probably thought
I was unattainable.

800
00:44:33,864 --> 00:44:35,664
<i>She was very smitten.</i>

801

should've called her barbara.

802
00:44:39,169 --> 00:44:41,270
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

803
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:44,407

- No no, decaf's for cowards.

Wantz had</i>

805
00:44:46,843 --> 00:44:49,445
<i>No anatomical evidence of

806
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:51,013
<i>It was all in her head
and he knows it.</i>

807
00:44:51,048 --> 00:44:53,349
And mrs. Miller, although
she had a terrible disease,

808
00:44:53,383 --> 00:44:54,984
Could have lived
for many years

809
00:44:55,018 --> 00:44:57,086
If she had been more willing to
participate in her own care.

810
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,990
Ah. So you're a doctor too now, dick?
( chuckles )

811
00:45:01,024 --> 00:45:02,858
Your honor,

<i>That he murdered marjorie
wantz or sherry miller.</i>

814
00:45:07,631 --> 00:45:10,533
This is all part of your
puritanical persecution

815
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:13,002
- Of dr. Kevorkian. - Enough.
I've reviewed the indictment.

816
00:45:13,036 --> 00:45:14,970
I'm dismissing
the charges.

817

<i>The act of assisting a suicide
is not a criminal act</i>

818

00:45:19,876 --> 00:45:22,845
But without a medical license,
he cannot dispense medication,

820
00:45:22,879 --> 00:45:25,614

- He won't, your honor.

I'm gonna kick your ass
till my legs fall off.

822
00:45:30,187 --> 00:45:31,987
It was a clear victory
for the most important

823
00:45:32,022 --> 00:45:33,889
Civil rights issue
of our time.

824
00:45:33,924 --> 00:45:36,358
So you're obviously not happy
with the judge's decision.

825
00:45:36,393 --> 00:45:39,895
- Where do you go from here?
- Governor engler needs to push a ban through

826

something, anything--

michigan to become

- They traced it

911
00:50:16,873 --> 00:50:19,675
To my storage file.

912
00:50:19,709 --> 00:50:22,411
They broke in
and they took--

913
00:50:22,445 --> 00:50:24,947
Whatever, who knows?
--All my personal files

914
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:26,615
To do god knows
what with.

915
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,784
- And now they padlocked it...
- All right.

916
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:31,053
- ...So I can't get in!
- I'm sorry about it, jack.

917
00:50:31,087 --> 00:50:32,955
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

918
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:35,524
I'm sorry it happened.
No one would expect this to happen,

919
00:50:35,558 --> 00:50:38,494
And mr. Fieger can get
everything back for you again.

920
00:50:38,528 --> 00:50:40,496
- Oh, mr. Fieger's gonna do it.
- Just calm down.

921
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:43,098
- I have explained to you.
- Nobody's gonna put

922
00:50:43,133 --> 00:50:46,268
Humpty dumpty together again.
Do you understand? He is gone.

923
00:50:46,302 --> 00:50:49,671
- He is finish.
They have my files! - Shh. Shh.

924
00:50:49,706 --> 00:50:52,741
I'm sorry about that.
There was an overdue bill...

925
00:50:52,776 --> 00:50:55,144
- That's right. - ...
And ava sent the check in.

926
00:50:55,178 --> 00:50:57,246
- She just wasn't thinking.
She wasn't thinking. - She wasn't thinking?

927
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,448
- Wasn't thinking? You're being so generous.
- That's right.

928
00:50:59,482 --> 00:51:03,452
<i>It was stupid.
It was blatant stupidity</i>

929
00:51:03,486 --> 00:51:05,421
- On her part and your part.
- Keep your voice down.

930
00:51:05,455 --> 00:51:08,257
- Stupid! Stupid. She was being stupid.
- Hold on there.

931
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:11,293
- Stupid stupid. - Don't you
talk about my daughter that way.

932
00:51:11,327 --> 00:51:12,861
- I'll talk about her that way.
- Do you hear me?

933
00:51:12,896 --> 00:51:15,230
- You calm down. Now stop it!
- I am completely calm!

934
00:51:15,265 --> 00:51:17,966
- Calm down! You're not calm!
- You know, I can't trust you.

935
00:51:18,001 --> 00:51:19,802
- I can't trust you and I can't trust her.
- You can't trust me?

936
00:51:19,836 --> 00:51:23,105
Either one of you. Together.
You don't make it easy for me.

937
00:51:23,139 --> 00:51:24,907
You're supposed to make it
easy for me, but you don't.

938
00:51:24,941 --> 00:51:26,608
How dare you, jack?
How dare you?

939
00:51:26,643 --> 00:51:28,811
You did this for the last time.
For the last time.

940
00:51:28,845 --> 00:51:30,779
All my life, I've been
making it easier for you.

941
00:51:30,814 --> 00:51:33,148
- Yeah, you make it-- - all my life!
Do you hear me?

942
00:51:33,183 --> 00:51:35,250
- Look who's yelling now.
- And it's been no walk in the park!

943
00:51:35,285 --> 00:51:37,152
That's right, it's been
no walk in the park!

944
00:51:37,187 --> 00:51:40,389
And I'm going to tell you something
else-- nobody takes care of me.

945
00:51:40,423 --> 00:51:42,424
I want to ask you: Who do
you think takes care of me?

946
00:51:42,459 --> 00:51:44,193
- Nobody! Not you, jack.
- I'm gonna take care of you.

947
00:51:44,227 --> 00:51:46,528
- Certainly not you!
- Right now I'm gonna take care of you.

948
00:51:46,563 --> 00:51:49,097
From now on, all you're gonna
do is operate the camera.

949
00:51:49,132 --> 00:51:51,166
That'll take care of you.
Believe me.

950
00:51:51,201 --> 00:51:53,635
You'll be fine with that,
'cause you can't screw that up.

951
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:56,405
- Okay, is that what you think?
- As for your daughter--

952
00:51:56,439 --> 00:51:58,974
- I have news for you.
- As for your daughter, the jury is out.

953
00:51:59,008 --> 00:52:00,742
You'll be doing it for yourself.
You do it for yourself.

954
00:52:00,777 --> 00:52:03,245
You're gonna do it.
How's that for news?

955
00:52:03,279 --> 00:52:04,847
- You'll do it, jack!
- That's fine by me.

956
00:52:04,881 --> 00:52:06,748
<i>- I'm through with you!

959
00:52:11,187 --> 00:52:13,355
Is this us?
Yeah.

<i>- ( door shuts ) -

You set that off.

962
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:22,631
Where the hell
is she going?

963
00:52:22,665 --> 00:52:25,367
<i>( typewriter clicking )</i>

964
00:52:27,303 --> 00:52:29,972
Margo, could you step
into my office

965
00:52:30,006 --> 00:52:31,974
For a second?
I need to talk to you.

966
00:52:36,145 --> 00:52:39,848
My dream was
to be an olympic skier.

967
00:52:41,217 --> 00:52:45,654
And after the car
accident, there was...

968
00:52:45,688 --> 00:52:47,523
A chance--

969
00:52:47,557 --> 00:52:49,291
Well, they told me that
there was a chance

970
00:52:49,325 --> 00:52:52,928
That I'd get the use of my legs
again, but it never happened.

971
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:54,696
So...

972
00:52:56,499 --> 00:52:59,902
I doused myself with
gasoline one night

973
00:52:59,936 --> 00:53:03,505
And lit a match.

974
00:53:11,281 --> 00:53:14,182
You know, the only thing worse
than this nightmare existence

975
00:53:14,217 --> 00:53:16,752
Is the nightmare of a
botched suicide attempt.

976
00:53:19,355 --> 00:53:22,424
I wish I could help you, son,
but it's not possible.

977
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,328
What-- what you're
suffering--

978
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:30,065
What dr.
Kevorkian is trying to say, glen,

979
00:53:30,099 --> 00:53:32,534
Is that you're
clinically depressed,

980
00:53:32,569 --> 00:53:34,736
And under these circumstances,
we can't help you.

981
00:53:34,771 --> 00:53:37,472
<i>If you deal with
your depression,</i>

982
00:53:37,507 --> 00:53:40,576
<i>You can lead a fulfilling
and satisfying life.</i>

983
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:44,746
<i>And we'll help you find
someone that will do that.</i>

984
00:54:03,766 --> 00:54:05,901
<i>( distant barking )</i>

985
00:54:09,305 --> 00:54:11,940
Parkinson's

986
00:54:11,975 --> 00:54:16,311
<i>Years before it compromises
your daily activities.</i>

987
00:54:17,914 --> 00:54:21,249
I don't think we can help
you now is what I'm saying.

988
00:54:21,284 --> 00:54:23,719
But if and when
the time comes,

989
00:54:23,753 --> 00:54:25,554
We'll be here for you.

990
00:54:25,588 --> 00:54:27,689
Okay.

991
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,739
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

992
00:54:49,045 --> 00:54:51,546
You know I've never been
one to hold grudges

993
00:54:51,581 --> 00:54:54,349
And I'd like to let
bygones be bygones.

994
00:54:54,384 --> 00:54:56,251
What do you say?

995
00:54:56,285 --> 00:54:58,320
Good.

996
00:54:59,322 --> 00:55:02,224
So we're reconciled?

997
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:04,526
- I hope so.
- Well, that's good.

998
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,729
Good.
It's good to see you.

999
00:55:07,764 --> 00:55:09,731
Good to see you.

1000
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,434
You need to get ready.

1001
00:55:12,468 --> 00:55:14,436
Ready for what?

1002
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:16,271
Dinner at mr.
Fieger's.

1003
00:55:16,305 --> 00:55:18,273
Very nice.

1004
00:55:18,307 --> 00:55:20,275
What's that?

1005
00:55:20,309 --> 00:55:23,045
Oh, it's a notice of sale.

1006
00:55:23,079 --> 00:55:25,814
I mean, this whole
building's kaput.

1007
00:55:25,848 --> 00:55:28,216
Well, don't worry about it.

1008
00:55:28,251 --> 00:55:30,252
We can live together.

1009
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:34,156
We'll be known as the
unemployed kevorkians! Yay!

<i>Unemployed?
What does that mean?</i>

1011
00:55:35,992 --> 00:55:37,959
It means...

1012
00:55:37,994 --> 00:55:39,695
I got fired.

1013
00:55:39,729 --> 00:55:41,797
No.
When?

1014
00:55:42,865 --> 00:55:44,433
A few weeks ago.

1015
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:46,601
You're just
telling me now?

1016
00:55:46,636 --> 00:55:49,504
Jack, we had
a falling out.

1017
00:55:49,539 --> 00:55:51,406

Are you going to kill every
single person in a wheelchair?

1024
00:56:11,794 --> 00:56:14,529
Disabled people are not worthless.
They are not a drain on society.

Sigmund freud,

00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:10,378
How may I live
without my name?

1062
00:58:10,413 --> 00:58:13,181
I've given
you my soul;

1063
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:17,185
<i>Leave me my name.
"</i>

1064
00:58:18,087 --> 00:58:19,688
<i>Woman: Oh.</i>

1065
00:58:21,224 --> 00:58:23,191
Is there
any more to that?

1066
00:58:24,994 --> 00:58:28,096
- ( laughing )
- no.

1067
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,865
<i>- Margo: Oh, jack.
- That was beautiful, jack.</i>

1068
00:58:29,899 --> 00:58:31,700
- Thank you.
- I didn't know you knew that.

1069
00:58:31,734 --> 00:58:33,969
<i>That's very good.
That was great.</i>

1070
00:58:34,003 --> 00:58:36,738
- It's all I know.
- You didn't like the sea bass?

1071
00:58:38,007 --> 00:58:40,709
It was
a bit fishy, but--

1072
00:58:40,743 --> 00:58:42,944
- Oh.
- No no no no.

1073
00:58:45,848 --> 00:58:47,916
Why did
you never marry, jack?

1074
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:49,951
Oh.
He was engaged once.

1075
00:58:49,986 --> 00:58:52,587
She worked at hudson's
on woodward, downtown.

1076
00:58:52,622 --> 00:58:55,190
- I knew her. I saw her.
- Let's not go there. Let's not go there.

1077
00:58:55,224 --> 00:58:57,225
- You never even liked her.
- No, I didn't like her.

1078
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:59,561
<i>- Jack: Let's not go there.
- All right, I won't go there.</i>

1079
00:58:59,595 --> 00:59:02,430
Oh, come on, come on.
Tell me about this fiance.

1080
00:59:02,465 --> 00:59:04,900
- ( groans ) - margo: Come on, jack.
Say a few words.

1081
00:59:04,934 --> 00:59:07,569
- A little something?
- What can I tell you?

1082
00:59:07,603 --> 00:59:10,338
- We broke up. It was-- you
know-- - I think the truth is

1083
00:59:10,373 --> 00:59:12,674
<i>That girls just make you
shake in your boots, jack.</i>

1084
00:59:12,708 --> 00:59:14,910
- Okay. Yeah.
- All right then.

1085
00:59:14,944 --> 00:59:16,845
Somebody needs
some coffee.

1086
00:59:16,879 --> 00:59:18,313
So come, margo,

1087
00:59:18,347 --> 00:59:21,583
Come where it's safe.

1088
00:59:26,122 --> 00:59:29,391
Governor engler's gonna be signing
a ban in a couple of months.

1089
00:59:29,425 --> 00:59:33,094
It'll make assisting a
suicide a four-year felony.

1090
00:59:33,129 --> 00:59:35,964
Oh.
Oh, that's laughable.

1091
00:59:35,998 --> 00:59:37,632
<i>It's a fucking charade,</i>

1092
00:59:37,667 --> 00:59:39,935
And I'll appeal it when
the time is right.

1093
00:59:39,969 --> 00:59:42,137
In the meantime, if you
have anything lined up,

1094
00:59:42,171 --> 00:59:44,539
<i>I suggest you get
it done pronto.</i>

1095
00:59:49,278 --> 00:59:50,845
<i>Neal: We'd have been
shit out of luck</i>

1096
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,647
<i>If I hadn't traced
those two down</i>

1097
00:59:52,682 --> 00:59:54,282
At a wholesaler
in kalamazoo,

1098
00:59:54,317 --> 00:59:57,018
Where it just so happens an
old flame of mine works.

1099
00:59:57,053 --> 01:00:00,021
A couple of happy-hour
margaritas sealed the deal.

1100
01:00:00,056 --> 01:00:01,923
Then it was
worth the drive?

1101
01:00:01,958 --> 01:00:04,626
( chuckles )
it's always worth it.

1102
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:07,462
Jack, I just ain't sure
these are gonna be enough.

1103
01:00:07,496 --> 01:00:10,332
I'll make it work.
I can ration it.

1104
01:00:11,867 --> 01:00:13,868
Anyway, I think
I've got an idea,

1105
01:00:13,903 --> 01:00:15,570
A way to recapture
the gas.

1106
01:00:15,604 --> 01:00:18,907
Let's stop over
at the hardware store.

1107
01:00:18,941 --> 01:00:20,608
Oh, and that's--

1108
01:00:20,643 --> 01:00:25,146
I apologize for putting
you through is, ma'am.

1109
01:00:25,181 --> 01:00:26,681
( wheezing coughing )

1110
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:31,186
It's the emphysema.

1111
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,154
I know.
Yes, I know.

1112
01:00:33,189 --> 01:00:35,590
I know.
We'll just wait for it to pass.

1113
01:00:35,624 --> 01:00:37,792
Let him have this one out.
Go ahead.

1114
01:00:37,827 --> 01:00:41,429
- ( breathing heavily
) - and we breathe.

1115
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,668
- Okay.
- Okay.

1116
01:00:46,702 --> 01:00:48,103
Okay, so we're--

1117
01:00:48,137 --> 01:00:50,205
I think we're ready
for the box first.

1118
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:51,973
Like I said
to you before,

1119
01:00:52,008 --> 01:00:54,976
Because of the
circumstances I'm in now,

1120
01:00:55,011 --> 01:00:58,113
We have to use this because
I'm saving the gas.

1121
01:00:58,147 --> 01:01:00,982
You understand?
We're going to recapture the gas.

1122
01:01:01,017 --> 01:01:04,052
They won't give me
more canisters,

1123
01:01:04,086 --> 01:01:06,087
And I have
other patients to serve--

1124
01:01:06,122 --> 01:01:08,456
Two others, and I--

1125
01:01:08,491 --> 01:01:11,026
Maybe this isn't such
a great idea, doctor.

1126
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:13,495
- I don't think it's gonna hold.
- I think it's gonna be fine.

1127
01:01:13,529 --> 01:01:14,963
We're almost there.

1128
01:01:14,997 --> 01:01:17,298
Just a little
more tape right here...

1129
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:20,001
- There. - ...
Just to keep it in. Here we go.

1130
01:01:20,036 --> 01:01:22,170
Like we talked about
before, all right?

1131
01:01:22,204 --> 01:01:26,041
What we said-- neal is gonna
turn on the gas canister...

1132
01:01:26,075 --> 01:01:28,643
- Okay. - ...
When you are ready.

1133
01:01:28,677 --> 01:01:30,311
So we're gonna get
the signal from you.

1134
01:01:30,346 --> 01:01:32,580
- Yes, sir.
- Sorry for this.

1135
01:01:32,615 --> 01:01:34,349
- This is not usual-- - no no.
No no.

1136
01:01:34,383 --> 01:01:36,918
This is not usually what we do,
but we've run out of luck here.

1137
01:01:36,952 --> 01:01:38,787
- It's okay.
It's all right. - Okay.

1138
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:40,422
Ready.

1139
01:01:43,259 --> 01:01:45,093
( gas hisses )

1140
01:01:46,829 --> 01:01:49,064
All right.

1141
01:01:49,098 --> 01:01:51,132
Thank you for
a great life, cheryl.

1142
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:53,635
Cheryl:
You too.

1143
01:01:58,441 --> 01:02:00,175
( gas hissing )

1144
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:05,146
You're so brave.

1145
01:02:16,892 --> 01:02:18,460
Wait.
Take-- take it off.

1146
01:02:18,494 --> 01:02:20,128
Take-- take it off.

1147
01:02:20,162 --> 01:02:23,565
- Take it off. Take it off.
- ( hissing stops )

1148
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:25,300
- Getting hot.
- Hot?

1149
01:02:25,334 --> 01:02:27,535
- Watch his-- watch his-- - hot.
Oh.

1150
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:29,270
- Getting so hot.
- It's what?

1151
01:02:29,305 --> 01:02:31,806
- Getting so hot.
Hot. - Hot.

1152
01:02:31,841 --> 01:02:36,244
- He's burning up.
- Okay, maybe we-- this has got to wait.

1153
01:02:36,278 --> 01:02:38,346
- Oh, I think so.
- No no, please.

1154
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:40,415
I wasn't-- I wasn't
prepared for the issue.

1155
01:02:40,449 --> 01:02:43,451
- I'm awfully sorry.
So let's-- - it's all right, doc.

1156
01:02:43,486 --> 01:02:46,821
It's all right.
Now, please.

1157
01:02:46,856 --> 01:02:50,959
Do it now, please.
( wheezes ) do it.

1158
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:56,698
Okay, let's do it
this way.

1159
01:02:56,732 --> 01:02:59,667
You kn,
let's get rid of that.

1160
01:02:59,702 --> 01:03:03,171
Just-- let's just put the box on.
It'd be better.

1161
01:03:03,205 --> 01:03:07,075
This is gonna
be easier, hugh.

1162
01:03:07,109 --> 01:03:09,144
- This--
- watch your head.

1163
01:03:09,178 --> 01:03:11,479
- Down.
- Okay.

1164
01:03:11,514 --> 01:03:12,947
- Watch your head.
- Jack: Here it is.

1165
01:03:12,982 --> 01:03:14,949
<i>- Neal: Mind your head.
- Jack: Mind your head.</i>

1166
01:03:14,984 --> 01:03:16,918
<i>Just push it-- that's it.
That's fine.</i>

1167
01:03:16,952 --> 01:03:20,088
This is gonna
be easier now,

1168
01:03:20,122 --> 01:03:24,125
Because the gas will
escape now.

1169
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,494
<i>It won't heat up.</i>

1170
01:03:26,529 --> 01:03:29,998
<i>Just like that, hugh.
Okay? Okay?</i>

1171
01:03:30,032 --> 01:03:32,634
<i>Now air is gonna get through,
so you'll be all right.</i>

1172
01:03:32,668 --> 01:03:34,536
You're not gonna heat up.

1173
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:36,504
Let me just get this.

1174
01:03:36,539 --> 01:03:39,140
Here we are.

1175
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:44,445
<i>Okay. Once again, when
you're ready, hugh,</i>

1176
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,915
<i>We'll have neal turn
the gas on again.</i>

1177
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:49,317
I love you, darling.

1178
01:03:49,351 --> 01:03:51,152
- I love you.
- I love you.

1179
01:03:51,187 --> 01:03:54,989
<i>( crying )
it's okay, darling.</i>

1180
01:03:56,926 --> 01:03:58,826
( gas hisses )

1181
01:04:03,032 --> 01:04:05,233
<i>- Hugh: You-- -
woman: I love you.</i>

1182
01:04:14,176 --> 01:04:17,378
<i>- ( clip clatters )
- woman: Oh god.</i>

1183
01:04:17,413 --> 01:04:19,881
<i>- ( crying )
- ( gas hissing )</i>

1184
01:04:22,985 --> 01:04:25,386
I love you.

1185
01:04:25,421 --> 01:04:27,622
I love you,
darling.

1186
01:04:28,958 --> 01:04:30,892
I love you.

1187
01:04:32,361 --> 01:04:34,896
( crying )

1188
01:04:47,643 --> 01:04:49,711
( whispers )
he's gone, my dear.

1189
01:05:05,427 --> 01:05:08,162
I'm gonna type out the
final action report.

1190
01:05:08,197 --> 01:05:10,164
And give it
to you tomorrow.

1191
01:05:20,409 --> 01:05:22,443
God!

1192
01:05:25,781 --> 01:05:27,649
So you ever gonna
say anything?

1193
01:05:27,683 --> 01:05:31,286
Because nothing irks me more than
having you sitting there simmering.

1194
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,755
<i>God forbid
I should irk you.</i>

1195
01:05:33,789 --> 01:05:36,257
Well, just spit it out.
You've got something to say.

1196
01:05:36,292 --> 01:05:39,661
The great jack kevorkian.
You know better.

1197
01:05:39,695 --> 01:05:42,530
- That's right.
- Nothing gets in the way of the mission.

1198
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:44,465
The mission?
What mission.

1199
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:47,335
Is that what
you call rationing,

1200
01:05:47,369 --> 01:05:51,139
Taping a fucking sheet of plastic
around a poor guy's head?

1201
01:05:51,173 --> 01:05:54,075
We should've waited
till we had more gas.

1202
01:05:54,109 --> 01:05:58,112
- Oh, and when would that have been I wonder?
- I should've insisted.

1203
01:05:59,248 --> 01:06:01,983
He was-- he was-- he
was-- he was done.

1204
01:06:02,017 --> 01:06:04,218
<i>Do you understand?
He wand it done.</i>

1205
01:06:04,253 --> 01:06:06,587
He was begging for it.
We wanted to go.

1206
01:06:06,622 --> 01:06:08,923
<i>We were ready to go.
He was beggingus to stay.</i>

1207
01:06:08,957 --> 01:06:11,592
He wanted it done.
You saw that.

1208
01:06:11,627 --> 01:06:14,495
Yeah, I saw it.
It freaked the shit out of me.

1209
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:18,099
Well, it worked out.

1210
01:06:18,133 --> 01:06:20,234
It got done.

1211
01:06:21,403 --> 01:06:23,271
I knew it would.

1212
01:06:27,042 --> 01:06:29,110
We can't be cutting
corners anymore.

1213
01:06:29,144 --> 01:06:30,912
This isn't the old days.

1214
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:33,448
We're not down in the
lab winging it anymore.

1215
01:06:38,921 --> 01:06:41,923
Jack, the next time it
doesn't feel right,

1216
01:06:41,957 --> 01:06:43,825
Call it off.

1217
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:50,832
These are
my decisions
to make, neal.

1218
01:06:50,866 --> 01:06:53,768
Mine alone.

1219
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:57,672
Yes, sir, kemo sabe.

1220
01:06:58,707 --> 01:07:00,675
<i>( typewriter clicking )</i>

1221
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:16,858
This is the one we got

1222
01:07:16,892 --> 01:07:18,793
Through the search
warrant at kevorkian's,

1223
01:07:18,827 --> 01:07:21,729
And you can see where he's whited out
a number of lines and typed over.

1224
01:07:21,764 --> 01:07:24,532
And this is the one
found in nicol's trash

1225
01:07:24,566 --> 01:07:26,868
<i>By a concerned activist.</i>

1226
01:07:26,902 --> 01:07:29,537
Mr. Gale's desperate pleas
to take off his gas mask

1227
01:07:29,571 --> 01:07:31,472
Were deleted and replaced
with the phrase...

1228
01:07:31,507 --> 01:07:33,941
"patient became flushed, agitated.
Breathing deeply."

1229
01:07:33,976 --> 01:07:36,477
"increased rate of respiration
and muscle tension

1230
01:07:36,512 --> 01:07:39,881
- With no overaction.
" - this directly contradicts

1231
01:07:39,915 --> 01:07:43,084
- Mr. Nicol's photocopied version...
- "saying 'take it off.'"

1232
01:07:43,118 --> 01:07:47,188
...And suggests that dr.
Kevorkian was attempting to cover something up.

1233
01:07:47,222 --> 01:07:49,624
"saying 'take it off'
once again,

1234
01:07:49,658 --> 01:07:51,492
He fell into unconsciousness.
"

1235
01:07:51,527 --> 01:07:54,495
The tragedy is that mr.
Gale did not want to die that day,

1236
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:56,030
But dr.
Kevorkian didn't care.

1237
01:07:56,064 --> 01:07:58,433
An inquest will be held.

1238
01:07:59,535 --> 01:08:01,302
<i>Thompson: He lied
in his report!</i>

1239
01:08:01,336 --> 01:08:03,004
<i>Fieger: He is the most
honest man I know.</i>

1240
01:08:03,038 --> 01:08:07,008
<i>- Honest to a fault!
- Man: Could we continue please?</i>

1241
01:08:08,744 --> 01:08:13,147
Mr. Nicol, when mr.
Gale said, "take it off"--

1242
01:08:13,182 --> 01:08:15,049
He was talking
about the plastic tent

1243
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:17,118
On his head,
not the gas mask.

1244
01:08:18,587 --> 01:08:22,790
And his lungs locked up.
That happens with emphysema.

1245
01:08:22,825 --> 01:08:24,625
Then why would dr.
Kevorkian

1246
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,427
Feel the need
to correct--

1247
01:08:26,462 --> 01:08:28,830
You're grasping
at straws here.

1248
01:08:30,265 --> 01:08:34,235
It was a simple
typographical error,

1249
01:08:34,269 --> 01:08:36,103
Which I had
pointed out to him

1250
01:08:36,138 --> 01:08:37,805
And he corrected.

1251
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:41,342
He typed up a new copy whieh was
going to go in our records.

1252
01:08:41,376 --> 01:08:42,777
Before you ransacked
his apartment!

1253
01:08:42,811 --> 01:08:45,513
But this typo, in its original,
was four lines long.

1254
01:08:45,547 --> 01:08:48,950
Why wouldn't he just rip it up and
start again if it was a mistake?

1255
01:08:51,787 --> 01:08:54,121
To save on paper.

1256
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:57,158
Dr.
Kevorkian is

1257
01:08:57,192 --> 01:08:59,460
Incredibly cheap.

1258
01:09:00,496 --> 01:09:03,731
<i>It was
a very emotional day,</i>

1259
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:05,967
<i>As they all are.</i>

1260
01:09:07,102 --> 01:09:09,003
And I'm sure
when he typed it up,

1261
01:09:09,037 --> 01:09:10,404
It was in the middle
of the night

1262
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:12,707
And he was trying to do
three things at once

1263
01:09:12,741 --> 01:09:14,642
<i>Like he always does.</i>

1264
01:09:16,745 --> 01:09:19,614
Mrs.
Gale, please,

1265
01:09:19,648 --> 01:09:22,450
For your husband's sake,

1266
01:09:23,418 --> 01:09:25,253
The truth.

1267
01:09:28,457 --> 01:09:29,957
( clears throat )

1268
01:09:29,992 --> 01:09:33,594
My husband of 22 years

1269
01:09:34,963 --> 01:09:38,499
Faced death so many times
from his seizures,

1270
01:09:39,701 --> 01:09:42,603
<i>He used to pray
not to wake up.</i>

1271
01:09:42,638 --> 01:09:44,839
<i>He talked about
shooting himself,</i>

1272
01:09:44,873 --> 01:09:48,509
<i>But he didn't want to leave
me the mess to clean up.</i>

1273
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:55,349
So here's your truth, mr.
Thompson.

1274
01:09:56,718 --> 01:09:59,186
As sick as hugh was,

1275
01:09:59,221 --> 01:10:01,589
I begged h
not to make the call.

1276
01:10:01,623 --> 01:10:04,091
I begged him every
night for nine months.

1277
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:07,228
<i>And then before christmas,</i>

1278
01:10:07,262 --> 01:10:09,997
<i>I asked him what he
wanted for a gift--</i>

1279
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:13,467
<i>The last gift I'd
ever give him--</i>

1280
01:10:17,806 --> 01:10:21,442
And he said, "there's only one
thing you can get me, sweetheart.

1281
01:10:22,711 --> 01:10:26,180
It's an appointment with dr.
Kevorkian."

1282
01:10:33,288 --> 01:10:35,790
I find no factual basis
to proceed.

1283
01:10:38,093 --> 01:10:40,595
<i>- ( jazz music playing )

Wow. No wonder everyone's
drinking at this show.

stepping on a baby?

1289
01:11:01,383 --> 01:11:05,453
- Yes. - Janet: Tell me
about doc's christmases.

1290
01:11:05,487 --> 01:11:07,888
It looks quite morbid--

1291
01:11:07,923 --> 01:11:09,924
Well, except for
the flower that is.

1292
01:11:09,958 --> 01:11:12,360
Thank god
I'm not a shrink.

<i>Margo: Our grandparents,
our aunts, our uncles,</i>

1294
01:11:16,798 --> 01:11:20,768
<i>The armenian holocaust was
the same as the jews.</i>

1295
01:11:20,802 --> 01:11:23,671
Only our parents--
barely teenagers--

1296
01:11:23,705 --> 01:11:25,539
Were able to flee.

1297
01:11:25,574 --> 01:11:29,243
Growing up, all we heard were those
terrible stories of all the bloodshed,

1298
01:11:29,277 --> 01:11:32,780
<i>And it frightened jack so.</i>

1299
01:11:32,814 --> 01:11:37,785
It's all dealing with the
melancholy age-old struggle

1300
01:11:37,819 --> 01:11:40,855
Between warmth of life,
the iciness of death.

1301
01:11:40,889 --> 01:11:44,859
Only I'm sure that theme
would be better served

1302
01:11:44,893 --> 01:11:47,561
Had a real artist done it.

<i>Margo: Many nights he would

Clutching that little
dog of ours so tightly.

<i>Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
He had a dog?</i>

1307
01:11:56,438 --> 01:11:58,039
You're looking
so intently.

1308
01:11:58,073 --> 01:12:00,274
- Yes. - What are you feeling?
That's what I'd like to know.

1309
01:12:00,308 --> 01:12:03,077
- Jack, it's, uh-- it's--
- it's, uh--

1310
01:12:03,111 --> 01:12:04,645
- Hi.
- Hi.

1311
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,414
- It's, um-- - I know
what you're feeling.

1312
01:12:06,448 --> 01:12:08,282
<i>You're feeling it's--
it's macabre.</i>

1313
01:12:08,316 --> 01:12:09,917
<i>Stan: It is macabre, my friend.
</i>

1314
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:11,919
<i>Jack: Yes, but you're
looking at it nonetheless.</i>

1315
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:14,922
It's like war.
War, you're drawn to it,

1316
01:12:14,956 --> 01:12:19,260
But after you've been through it,
you say, "oh, that was grotesque,

1317
01:12:19,294 --> 01:12:22,396
Macabre, strange, ugly.
"

1318
01:12:22,431 --> 01:12:24,799
That's the feeling I'm
trying to convey.

1319
01:12:24,833 --> 01:12:27,234
- I'm sold.
- I heard "sold."

1320
01:12:27,269 --> 01:12:30,871
- How much, jack?
- Whatever you think is fair.

1321
01:12:30,906 --> 01:12:33,407
- My patients thank you in advance.
- Good.

1322

1657
01:30:57,144 --> 01:30:59,779
I told you those videotapes were
going to be our golden ticket.

1658
01:30:59,814 --> 01:31:04,150
We have to take this to
the supreme court, geoff.

1659
01:31:04,185 --> 01:31:05,618
We have to do it.

1660
01:31:05,653 --> 01:31:07,620
We've still got
to get a law

1661
01:31:07,655 --> 01:31:10,723
- Legalizing assisted suicide, no?
- Congratulations.

1662
01:31:10,758 --> 01:31:13,793
Hey, jack. Come on.
You won. Enjoy yourself.

1663
01:31:13,828 --> 01:31:15,795
Morganroth is right, jack.
You'll never see another courtroom again.

1664
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:17,564
<i>The house of cards
is falling</i>

1665
01:31:17,598 --> 01:31:19,732
And engler's
going down with it.

1666
01:31:22,069 --> 01:31:25,305
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen!
- Man: Come on.</i>

1667

<i>Fieger: Please please, I have
an important announcement.</i>

1668
01:31:28,976 --> 01:31:30,910
I have decided
to run for governor.

1669
01:31:30,945 --> 01:31:32,378
- Hear hear!
- ( cheering )

1670
01:31:32,413 --> 01:31:35,815
<i>- Man: Whoo!
- Fieger: Fieger for governor!</i>

1671
01:31:37,785 --> 01:31:40,119
Feiger's
your finest!

1672
01:31:41,121 --> 01:31:43,590
<i>Next stop--
lansing!</i>

1673
01:31:55,269 --> 01:31:59,873
<i>Fieger: David gorcyca,
oakland county prosecutor.</i>

1674
01:31:59,907 --> 01:32:01,674
It has
a nice ring to it.

1675
01:32:01,709 --> 01:32:05,211
You know, you owe me after the way
I demolished thompson for you.

1676
01:32:05,246 --> 01:32:07,380
And I know you'll stay
out of jack's hair.

1677
01:32:07,414 --> 01:32:09,716
Thomson blew away too
many taxpayer dollars

1678
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:11,251
On these prwsecutions.

1679
01:32:11,285 --> 01:32:13,820
I've no intention to
waste one more nickel.

1680
01:32:13,854 --> 01:32:15,855
As long as kevorkian
stays in line,

1681
01:32:15,890 --> 01:32:18,224
He can assist as many patients
as he damn well pleases.

1682
01:32:18,259 --> 01:32:21,995
No worries. Jack's learned to
listen to everything I say.

1683
01:32:23,831 --> 01:32:26,266
<i>Jack: You know, I'm
only operating</i>

1684

<i>By the grace of
this prosecutor.</i>

1685
01:32:28,702 --> 01:32:31,871
<i>"go ahead.
You can go do your thing</i>

1686
01:32:31,906 --> 01:32:34,107
<i>In some dark little
corner of the universe,</i>

1687
01:32:34,141 --> 01:32:36,442
But do it quietly.
" you know?

1688
01:32:36,477 --> 01:32:39,245
Oh, the lingering
of death.

1689
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:40,813
What a business.

1690
01:32:40,848 --> 01:32:42,982
Keep death alive.

1691
01:32:43,017 --> 01:32:45,418
Hospitals don't make
money otherwise.

1692
01:32:45,452 --> 01:32:47,453
Drug companies either.

1693
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:50,356
<i>If you're rich and
you have the money,</i>

1694
01:32:50,391 --> 01:32:52,258
<i>You can pay to die.</i>

1695
01:32:52,293 --> 01:32:54,994
<i>But the poor, they
can only afford</i>

1696
01:32:55,029 --> 01:32:57,397
<i>To stick it out
and suffer.</i>

1697
01:32:57,431 --> 01:33:01,034
They say complacency
is a virtue.

1698
01:33:01,068 --> 01:33:04,604
Oh, stop whining.
You make me more nauseous than my chemo.

1699
01:33:04,638 --> 01:33:08,241
You have full reign.
Just deal with it.

1700
01:33:08,275 --> 01:33:10,510
Yeah.

1701
01:33:12,179 --> 01:33:14,981
( sighs ) I think the
biggest mistake of my life

1702
01:33:15,015 --> 01:33:16,916
Was not getting married.

1703
01:33:16,951 --> 01:33:19,686
- Excuse me?
- I could've, you know,

1704
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:21,888
Procreated.

1705
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:24,891
Kept the family name alive.

1706
01:33:24,925 --> 01:33:26,459
- Why not?
- Procreate?

1707
01:33:26,493 --> 01:33:29,128
Yowould've made
that big a sacrifice

1708
01:33:29,163 --> 01:33:31,597
To keep the family name alive?
You would've done that?

1709
01:33:33,334 --> 01:33:37,136
Well, sometimes, you've got to
get your hands a little dirty.

1710
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:42,976
Well, could you have
loved though, doc?

1711
01:33:43,911 --> 01:33:45,578
<i>That's the bigger question.</i>

1712
01:33:46,513 --> 01:33:48,781
Could you have loved?

1713
01:33:52,453 --> 01:33:54,988
You didn't put sugar
in here again.

1714
01:33:56,323 --> 01:33:59,592
Ah.
Don't get up.

1715
01:33:59,626 --> 01:34:02,428
We need to have
a conversation.

1716
01:34:03,931 --> 01:34:06,199
Mmm.
You know I'm not lugging

1717
01:34:06,233 --> 01:34:08,868
This thing around just
'cause it's sexy.

1718
01:34:08,902 --> 01:34:11,771
And you're the only
doctor in my neighborhood

1719
01:34:11,805 --> 01:34:13,840
That practices euthanasia.

1720
01:34:13,874 --> 01:34:16,142
Oh, we're not there yet.

1721
01:34:16,176 --> 01:34:17,944

On the assisted suicide issue?

01:34:38,232 --> 01:34:40,366
I give my word to the

<i>No longer advocating

could it be an armenian thing?

1764
01:37:07,214 --> 01:37:10,416
Margo was just as armenian as you
are and she talked my ear off.

1765
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:13,052
( chuckles )
she told me everything.

1766
01:37:13,086 --> 01:37:15,988
She could share.
You don't share.

want me to share?

<i>I'm afraid for you.</i>

- Yes. Okay.

1777
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:48,788
See, you know margo and
I were the only two

1778
01:37:48,822 --> 01:37:51,757
That could tell you to shut up.
( chuckles )

1779
01:37:51,792 --> 01:37:56,095
Look. You need more
people in your corner,

Not less.

1781
01:37:57,931 --> 01:38:00,032
People that you can trust.

1782
01:38:01,301 --> 01:38:03,769
And the only way people
trust each other

1783
01:38:03,804 --> 01:38:06,005
Is if they know each other.

1784
01:38:06,039 --> 01:38:07,907
And nobody knows you.

1785
01:38:07,941 --> 01:38:09,842
Nobody.

1786
01:38:09,876 --> 01:38:12,645
How did it feel

1787
01:38:12,679 --> 01:38:15,147
When your mother
was dying?

1788
01:38:15,182 --> 01:38:18,084
You were a doctor,
a healer,

1789
01:38:18,118 --> 01:38:21,787
And you were helpless.
How did that feel?

1790
01:38:23,824 --> 01:38:26,759
( sighs )
you know, I failed her.

1791
01:38:26,793 --> 01:38:28,961
I failed my mother.

1792
01:38:31,398 --> 01:38:32,932
And?

1793
01:38:36,303 --> 01:38:38,237
She once said to me

1794
01:38:39,206 --> 01:38:41,974
"imagine, jack,

1795
01:38:42,009 --> 01:38:46,112
The worst toothache

Now imagine

Being in every bone

01:39:08,201 --> 01:39:10,002

Trying to keep her alive.

1812

1813
01:39:51,745 --> 01:39:54,280
I was powerless,

1814
01:39:54,314 --> 01:39:56,515
Helpless
and ineffectual.

1815
01:40:03,290 --> 01:40:05,057

But I do think there
is an argument here

2072
01:54:30,089 --> 01:54:32,390
That murder

2073

Incompatible charges
by definition.

2074

Well, that may be something to be

But not in my courtroom.

01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:49,975

2083
01:54:59,852 --> 01:55:02,087
It just occurred to me--

2084
01:55:03,723 --> 01:55:06,925
Why don't we drop the assisted
suicide charge altogether?

2085
01:55:09,095 --> 01:55:10,929
What are you saying?

2086
01:55:12,164 --> 01:55:15,267
I'm saying that
what proved lethal

2087
01:55:15,301 --> 01:55:17,435
In all our other cases was

2088
01:55:17,470 --> 01:55:19,504
The family members
testifying,

2089
01:55:19,538 --> 01:55:23,141
Juries hearing about the
conditions of the victims,

2090
01:55:23,175 --> 01:55:24,843
How much pain
they were in

2091
01:55:24,877 --> 01:55:26,811
And all that bullshit.

2092
01:55:26,846 --> 01:55:29,214
So if we drop
the charge,

2093
01:55:29,248 --> 01:55:30,649
Make it all
or nothing on murder,

01:56:08,321 --> 01:56:11,323
Whatever is
left of it, sure.

2107
01:56:13,025 --> 01:56:14,626
You understand
what prison is?

2108
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:17,829
Did you see "the shawshank
redemption," sir?

2109
01:56:17,863 --> 01:56:20,231
No.

2110
01:56:20,266 --> 01:56:24,135
Do you understand you may not
disrupt or inconvenience the court

2111
01:56:24,170 --> 01:56:26,504
<i>In any way,
shape or form?</i>

2112
01:56:26,539 --> 01:56:31,142
I will act like
the guest that I am.

2113
01:56:32,378 --> 01:56:34,346
You're no guest.
You're the defendant.

2114
01:56:34,380 --> 01:56:36,381
<i>Man: What do you think of dr.
Jack kevorkian</i>

2115
01:56:36,415 --> 01:56:38,750
<i>Actually helping people
kill themselves?</i>

2116
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:40,919
Well, my grandma's
very sk

2117
01:56:40,953 --> 01:56:42,620
And everyday
she asks me

2118
01:56:42,655 --> 01:56:44,289
"bring me jack kevorkian.
"

2119
01:56:44,323 --> 01:56:45,757
Doctors are
supposed to uphold

2120
01:56:45,791 --> 01:56:48,093
The hippocratic oath,
though, save lives.

2121
01:56:48,127 --> 01:56:49,661
Some people are dying

2122
01:56:49,695 --> 01:56:52,864
And they should be dying
gracefully with dignity and honor.

2123
01:56:52,898 --> 01:56:54,666
But I don't think we ought to put
them out to pasture this way.

2124
01:56:54,700 --> 01:56:56,835
I think he rocks.
He gives people a choice

2125
01:56:56,869 --> 01:56:58,870
Of whether or not
they want to suffer

2126
01:56:58,904 --> 01:57:00,872
Throughout
terminal illnesses or not.

2127
01:57:00,906 --> 01:57:02,874
Dr. Jack kevorkian is one
of the most audacious

2128
01:57:02,908 --> 01:57:05,143
Serial killers this
country has ever known.

2129
01:57:05,177 --> 01:57:07,479
Let's say your mother
wanted his help,

2130
01:57:07,513 --> 01:57:08,747
Wanted to kill herself.

2131
01:57:08,781 --> 01:57:10,415
What would
you think of that?

2132
01:57:10,449 --> 01:57:12,250
Well, if she was
mentally competent,

2133
01:57:12,284 --> 01:57:14,185
I would ask her
what she wanted

2134
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:15,720
And support her.

2135
01:57:15,755 --> 01:57:17,822
<i>Woman: The names of
dozens of other people</i>

2136
01:57:17,857 --> 01:57:19,824
<i>Who have died with the
help of jack kevorkian</i>

2137
01:57:19,859 --> 01:57:22,460
<i>Laid out on the courthouse
lawn to make a point.</i>

2138
01:57:22,495 --> 01:57:25,430
Conviction is important,
cause jack kevorkian is

2139
01:57:25,464 --> 01:57:28,466
The most public symbol of the euthanasia
movement and we need to stop him.

2140
01:57:28,501 --> 01:57:30,402
<i>Skrzynski: Please tell us, dr.
Dragovic,</i>

2141
01:57:30,436 --> 01:57:33,371
Did mr. Youk's a.L.S.
Contribute to his death at all?

2142
01:57:33,406 --> 01:57:35,140
<i>- No. - Skrzynski:
Then how did he die?</i>

2143
01:57:35,174 --> 01:57:39,544
He was poisoned by intravenously-
injected substances.

2144
01:57:39,578 --> 01:57:42,180
<i>Jack on tv: Is homicide
always murder, doctor?</i>

2145
01:57:42,214 --> 01:57:45,250
- No, sir.
- When is it not murder?

2146
01:57:45,284 --> 01:57:47,285
<i>Skrzynski: Objection.
That's a legal question.</i>

2147
01:57:47,319 --> 01:57:50,789
Sir, you may question him in
regard to his autopsy report,

2148
01:57:50,823 --> 01:57:53,057
But nothing further
that's legal.

2149
01:57:53,092 --> 01:57:55,460
- But why? Look, I-- -
judge: If you had consulted

2150
01:57:55,494 --> 01:57:57,262
<i>Your attorney, he'd
tell you why.</i>

2151
01:57:58,931 --> 01:58:02,467
Uh, okay.

2152
01:58:04,236 --> 01:58:06,171
<i>- Is euthanasia always murder?
- Skrzynski: Objection.</i>

2153
01:58:07,606 --> 01:58:10,375
Always homicide?

2154
01:58:10,409 --> 01:58:13,645
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, it's always homicide.

2155
01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:16,648
And you stated
that homicide

2156
01:58:16,682 --> 01:58:20,385
Is not necessarily
always murder.

2157
01:58:20,419 --> 01:58:22,187
Therefore...

2158
01:58:23,556 --> 01:58:25,890
Out of pure logic,
wouldn't you say

2159
01:58:25,925 --> 01:58:28,493
That euthanasia is
not always murder?

2160
01:58:28,527 --> 01:58:30,562
<i>Skrzynski: Objection.
Calls for a legal conclusion.</i>

2161
01:58:30,596 --> 01:58:33,331
<i>Jack: No, it calls
for simple logic.</i>

2162
01:58:33,365 --> 01:58:36,167
<i>It's-- it's--
it's a syllogism.</i>

2163
01:58:36,202 --> 01:58:38,303
<i>It calls for nothing
but syllogism.</i>

2164
01:58:38,337 --> 01:58:41,206
Again, you're asking him to
make a legal conclusion.

2165
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:43,475
No, but this is a
mathematical conclusion.

2166
01:58:43,509 --> 01:58:44,976
<i>It's simple arithmetic.</i>

2167
01:58:45,010 --> 01:58:47,412
I don't know shit
about the law either,

2168
01:58:47,446 --> 01:58:49,747
But I know when I'm
watching a train wreck.

2169
01:58:49,782 --> 01:58:51,816
Yeah, well, I told him
gorosh is a putz.

2170
01:58:51,851 --> 01:58:54,285
<i>It can't possibly
be a fair fight.</i>

2171
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:57,956
You gotta do something, geoff.
Anything.

2172
01:59:00,626 --> 01:59:02,527
- Dr. Kevorkian.
- Oh.

2173
01:59:02,561 --> 01:59:05,396
Tom's brother's flight
from France

2174
01:59:05,431 --> 01:59:08,399
Got delayed,
but he will be here soon.

2175
01:59:08,434 --> 01:59:10,401
Okay, don't worry.

2176
01:59:10,436 --> 01:59:13,238
We'rgonna get you both
on the stand to testify.

2177
01:59:13,272 --> 01:59:16,975
I know you want to call melody
youk as your first witness,

2178
01:59:17,009 --> 01:59:19,577
But what is it that she's
going to testify to?

2179
01:59:19,612 --> 01:59:23,047
Well, she's going to
testify about my intent,

2180
01:59:23,082 --> 01:59:26,584
<i>What she observed and
our discussions--</i>

2181
01:59:26,619 --> 01:59:29,587
Dr. Kevorkian, that has
no relevance here.

2182
01:59:29,622 --> 01:59:32,790
I assumed your counsel would've
advised you about this,

2183
01:59:32,825 --> 01:59:36,294
That once the assisted
suicide charge was dropped,

2184
01:59:36,328 --> 01:59:38,897
You could no longer put these
witnesses before the jury.

2185
01:59:38,931 --> 01:59:40,698
Yeah, but I'm talking
about what went on,

2186
01:59:40,733 --> 01:59:42,567
You know,
as to my intent.

2187
01:59:42,601 --> 01:59:45,370
Your feeling compelled to help mr.
Youk

2188
01:59:45,404 --> 01:59:47,171
<i>Is not a legal defense,</i>

2189
01:59:47,206 --> 01:59:49,607
<i>And you're already aware
that a person's condition</i>

2190
01:59:49,642 --> 01:59:51,476
<i>Has no bearing in
a murder case.</i>

2191
01:59:51,510 --> 01:59:53,611
But that I didn't kill
her husband, you see.

2192
01:59:53,646 --> 01:59:55,680
- This is relevant.
- Okay. Okay.

2193
01:59:55,714 --> 01:59:57,382
We'll make
a special record

2194
01:59:57,416 --> 01:59:59,050
Outside the presence
of the jury.

2195
01:59:59,084 --> 02:00:00,885
I will rule on that.

2196
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:02,387
- Okay.
- All right?

2197
02:00:02,421 --> 02:00:04,489
- Can I-- okay.
Thank you. - Thank you.

2198
02:00:04,523 --> 02:00:07,625
<i>Jack:
Melody, did you tell me</i>

2199
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:09,460
<i>It was your intention</i>

2200
02:00:09,495 --> 02:00:11,796
<i>Or tom's intention</i>

2201
02:00:11,830 --> 02:00:14,699
<i>- That I kill him?
- Melody: Oh, no no no no.</i>

2202
02:00:14,733 --> 02:00:16,167
<i>That was not our intent.</i>

2203
02:00:16,201 --> 02:00:19,704
And when I met you, I felt
it was not your intent.

2204
02:00:19,738 --> 02:00:22,974
It was never your intent
or our intent that tom--

2205
02:00:23,008 --> 02:00:25,076
<i>Jack: There it is.
There it is. You see?</i>

2206
02:00:25,110 --> 02:00:28,947
--Other than released
from suffering.

2207
02:00:28,981 --> 02:00:32,450
So the word "kill," did it ever crop up?
Or "murder"?

2208
02:00:32,484 --> 02:00:34,652
No.
No.

2209
02:00:34,687 --> 02:00:36,387
Ugly words.

2210
02:00:36,422 --> 02:00:38,957
Ugly ugly words.

2211
02:00:42,761 --> 02:00:45,763
You're talking
about mercy killing.

2212
02:00:45,798 --> 02:00:49,167
<i>And her statements
can't show</i>

2213
02:00:49,201 --> 02:00:51,803
Your state of mind.
They only show hers.

2214
02:00:51,837 --> 02:00:55,607
Therefore, I cannot allow her
to testify before the jury.

2215
02:00:55,641 --> 02:00:56,975
But wait.
I want to say something--

2216
02:00:57,009 --> 02:00:59,110
That-- I have
so much I want to say.

2217
02:00:59,144 --> 02:01:03,247
I have been waiting for four goddamn
months for this opportunity!

2218
02:01:03,282 --> 02:01:06,050
You may call it
mercy killing.

2219
02:01:06,085 --> 02:01:08,019
I call
it something else.

2220
02:01:08,053 --> 02:01:09,921
I call it
a medical service

2221
02:01:09,955 --> 02:01:12,924
For an agonized, incurably
suffering patient.

2222
02:01:12,958 --> 02:01:14,359
That's what I call it.
All right?

2223
02:01:14,393 --> 02:01:16,761
Why don't-- what difference
does it make what you call it?

2224
02:01:16,795 --> 02:01:20,064
When you have these fine
stipulations of law

2225
02:01:20,099 --> 02:01:21,933
Standing in the way of a
dedicated physician--

2226
02:01:21,967 --> 02:01:25,436
And I am
a dedicated physician.

2227
02:01:25,471 --> 02:01:28,139
I mean, my integrity
would be destroyed

2228
02:01:28,173 --> 02:01:30,375
If I turned my back
on that patient.

2229
02:01:30,409 --> 02:01:33,011
I would rather
be dead.

2230
02:01:33,045 --> 02:01:35,046
It-- it's far worse.

2231
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:38,082
You could-- you could take my life.
It would be worse.

2232
02:01:38,117 --> 02:01:41,552
This was a service.
This was a service.

2233
02:01:41,587 --> 02:01:44,689
It had nothing to do
with "kill" or "murder"

2234
02:01:44,723 --> 02:01:46,257
- Or wh-- it was a service.
- ( sobbing )

2235
02:01:46,291 --> 02:01:48,793
It was a medical service
that was being done.

2236
02:01:48,827 --> 02:01:50,762
I can't be clearer.

2237
02:01:50,796 --> 02:01:52,397
I can't be clearer
than that, your honor.

2238
02:01:56,301 --> 02:01:58,403
I see the emotion,

2239
02:01:58,437 --> 02:02:01,105
I understand it, but
it's not relevant.

2240
02:02:02,941 --> 02:02:05,777
Please step down, mrs.
Youk.

2241
02:02:11,283 --> 02:02:15,720
Jessica cooper has already ruled that dr.
Kevorkian's side

2242
02:02:15,754 --> 02:02:18,589
Can't put into evidence that
there was suffering here

2243
02:02:18,624 --> 02:02:20,758
By the victim.
Does that make any sense?

2244
02:02:20,793 --> 02:02:22,894
No, 'cause, see, I think
it's an improper ruling

2245
02:02:22,928 --> 02:02:25,596
<i>Both in terms of the
nature of this trial</i>

2246
02:02:25,631 --> 02:02:27,765
<i>And criminal defenses
in general.</i>

2247
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:30,835
You're entitled to put forward
any plausible defense

2248
02:02:30,869 --> 02:02:32,336
To explain
the context of your act,

2249
02:02:32,371 --> 02:02:35,907
<i>And she's already limited
him from doing that.</i>

2250
02:02:35,941 --> 02:02:37,642
It's like watching
a man hang himself.

2251
02:02:37,676 --> 02:02:39,210
I've been watching
the television.

2252
02:02:39,244 --> 02:02:41,446
Once you knew they were dropping
the assisted suicide charge,

2253
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:43,681
- What was your plan?
- He doesn't let me help him.

2254
02:02:43,716 --> 02:02:45,783
- Hey, what am I supposed to do?
- You're supposed to

2255
02:02:45,818 --> 02:02:47,585
Get creative, that's what
you're supposed to do.

2256
02:02:47,619 --> 02:02:49,587
Why didn't you argue that
youk's wife and brother

2257
02:02:49,621 --> 02:02:51,322
Were eyewitnesses
to the event

2258
02:02:51,356 --> 02:02:53,024
That the prosecutor's
calling a murder?

2259
02:02:53,058 --> 02:02:55,093
<i>Then judge cooper would've had
to have let them testify.</i>

2260
02:02:55,127 --> 02:02:56,828
But that window's
closed now.

2261
02:02:56,862 --> 02:03:00,064
- Did you ever pass the fucking bar exam?

2262
02:03:03,569 --> 02:03:05,703
Dave.

2263
02:03:09,308 --> 02:03:12,176
There are those who would say about dr.
Jack kevorkian,

2264
02:03:12,211 --> 02:03:14,278
"right message,
wrong messenger."

2265
02:03:14,313 --> 02:03:16,347
And who is
the right messenger?

2266
02:03:17,916 --> 02:03:19,984
Uh...

2267
02:03:20,018 --> 02:03:22,754
Now I'm confused about this, dr.
Kevorkian.

2268
02:03:22,788 --> 02:03:24,589
<i>You said you had
another witness.</i>

2269
02:03:24,623 --> 02:03:27,992
I'm not allowing
his testimony

2270
02:03:28,026 --> 02:03:30,928
On the same grounds I
didn't allow mrs. Youk's.

2271
02:03:30,963 --> 02:03:34,665
I'm sorry you flew all this way, mr.
Youk.

2272
02:03:37,136 --> 02:03:38,703
Would you like
to take the stand

2273
02:03:38,737 --> 02:03:41,105
In your own defense, dr.
Kevorkian?

2274
02:03:57,890 --> 02:03:57,955
( whispers )
I'm sorry.

2275
02:03:59,591 --> 02:04:03,294
<i>Cooper: Sir, would you
like to take the stand</i>

2276
02:04:03,328 --> 02:04:06,097
<i>- In your own defense?
- Oh, I heard you.</i>

2277
02:04:06,131 --> 02:04:08,132
I did.

2278
02:04:16,041 --> 02:04:17,742
Um.

2279
02:04:22,981 --> 02:04:25,082
You know,
I don't lie

2280
02:04:25,117 --> 02:04:29,587
And I-- I--
I don't exaggerate.

2281
02:04:34,059 --> 02:04:37,829
And, um, you know,
you never said why.

2282
02:04:37,863 --> 02:04:41,999
You accuse me
of these heinous things,

2283
02:04:42,034 --> 02:04:44,702
But you never said why.
Did you?

2284
02:04:44,736 --> 02:04:47,438
No, just saying.
I'm just saying.

2285
02:04:47,472 --> 02:04:49,941
You know,
just so you know.

2286
02:04:49,975 --> 02:04:53,711
<i>Cooper: Sir, let's keep
to the relevance here.</i>

2287
02:04:53,745 --> 02:04:55,880
Oh, this is--
oh, it's not relevant?

2288
02:04:55,914 --> 02:04:58,216
I guess it's not.

2289
02:04:58,250 --> 02:04:59,584
It's not relevant.

2290
02:05:01,220 --> 02:05:03,287
Uh.

2291
02:05:03,322 --> 02:05:05,122
<i>Cooper:
I will ask you again.</i>

2292
02:05:05,157 --> 02:05:09,560
<i>Would you like to take the stand
in your own defense, sir?</i>

2293
02:05:22,174 --> 02:05:24,108
<i>It's now or never.</i>

2294
02:05:24,142 --> 02:05:26,010
Never.

2295
02:05:28,814 --> 02:05:31,549
No.
No.

2296
02:05:33,852 --> 02:05:37,455
The defense...
Rests.

2297
02:05:40,325 --> 02:05:43,327
<i>Skrzynski: Not since
ruby killed oswald</i>

2298
02:05:43,362 --> 02:05:46,130
<i>Did we see a murder
on television.</i>

2299
02:05:47,466 --> 02:05:51,168
<i>Jack kevorkian came like
a hit man in the night</i>

2300
02:05:51,203 --> 02:05:54,939
<i>With a bag of poison
to do his job.</i>

2301
02:05:54,973 --> 02:05:57,975
What would happen
if he got his way

2302
02:05:58,010 --> 02:06:00,745
And made
the state policy
euthanasia?

2303
02:06:00,779 --> 02:06:02,713
What could go wrong?

2304
02:06:02,748 --> 02:06:06,017
Well, there are 11 million
souls buried in europe...

2305
02:06:06,051 --> 02:06:08,219
<i>- Oh! - ...
That can tell you that when you make</i>

Euthanasia
a state policy

2307
02:06:10,122 --> 02:06:11,689
Some catastrophic things
can evolve

2308
02:06:11,723 --> 02:06:13,658
- From opening up that box.
- How dare you?!

2309
02:06:13,692 --> 02:06:15,192
- How dare you...
- Cooper: Dr. Kevorkian!

2310
02:06:15,227 --> 02:06:17,862
<i>- ...Compare euthanasia with the genocide?!
- ( gavel pounding )</i>

2311
02:06:17,896 --> 02:06:20,731
<i>- How dare you!
- Melody: You have crossed the line!</i>

2312
02:06:20,766 --> 02:06:23,234
<i>- Where is your decency and respect?
- Cooper: Order in the court.</i>

2313
02:06:23,268 --> 02:06:25,970
Order in this court.

2314
02:06:26,004 --> 02:06:29,140
We will take
a brief recess.

2315
02:06:29,174 --> 02:06:31,275
( people whispering )

2316
02:06:37,115 --> 02:06:39,750
Do you see
a criminal?

2317
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:44,088
Do you see
a murderer?

2318
02:06:44,122 --> 02:06:46,223
If you do,

2319
02:06:46,258 --> 02:06:48,693
Then you--
you must convict.

2320
02:06:50,729 --> 02:06:55,132
And then take the harsh
judgment of history

2321
02:06:55,167 --> 02:07:00,071
And the even harsher
judgment of your children

2322
02:07:00,105 --> 02:07:04,008
And their children if
they should ever come

2323
02:07:04,042 --> 02:07:07,278
To need this choe
in their lives.

2324
02:07:08,814 --> 02:07:11,882
I just ask you
to think about that.

2325
02:07:24,062 --> 02:07:27,198
Guilty of the lesser charge
of second-degree murder.

<i>Woman: He's out of time.
Yes.</i>

2331
02:07:47,019 --> 02:07:51,922
You invited yourself here
to make a final stand.

2332
02:07:51,957 --> 02:07:54,759
You invited yourself
to the wrong forum.

2333
02:07:54,793 --> 02:07:58,329
<i>Our nation tolerates
differences of opinions</i>

2334
02:07:58,363 --> 02:08:00,865
<i>Because we have a civilized
and non-violent way</i>

2335
02:08:00,899 --> 02:08:02,867
<i>Of resolving
our conflicts.</i>

2336
02:08:02,901 --> 02:08:05,269
We have the means
and methods

2337
02:08:05,303 --> 02:08:07,438
To protest laws with
which we disagree.

2338
02:08:07,472 --> 02:08:10,174
<i>You can criticize
the law,</i>

2339
02:08:10,208 --> 02:08:11,809
<i>Lecture about the law,</i>

2340
02:08:11,843 --> 02:08:14,812
<i>Speak to the media
or petition voters,</i>

2341
02:08:14,846 --> 02:08:17,281
<i>But you must always stay</i>

2342
02:08:17,315 --> 02:08:19,083
Within the limits
provided by the law.

2343
02:08:19,117 --> 02:08:21,018
<i>You may not
break the law</i>

2344
02:08:21,053 --> 02:08:23,654
<i>Or take the law into
your own hands.</i>

2345
02:08:23,688 --> 02:08:26,457
<i>No one's unmindful</i>

2346
02:08:26,491 --> 02:08:29,660
<i>Of the controversy and
emotion that exists</i>

2347
02:08:29,694 --> 02:08:32,363
<i>Over end-of-life issues
and pain control.</i>

2348
02:08:32,397 --> 02:08:35,132
<i>I assume the debate
will continue</i>

2349
02:08:35,167 --> 02:08:38,569
<i>In a calm and reasoned forum
long after this trial</i>

2350
02:08:38,603 --> 02:08:42,406
<i>And your activities have faded
from the public memory.</i>

2351
02:08:42,441 --> 02:08:45,609
But this trial was not
about that controversy.

2352
02:08:45,644 --> 02:08:48,245
This trial was
about you, sir.

2353
02:08:49,247 --> 02:08:50,981

<i>The legislature and
the supreme court.</i>

2355
02:08:53,785 --> 02:08:56,821
Moreover, you've defied your
own medical profession.

2356
02:08:56,855 --> 02:08:59,824
<i>This trial was about
lawlessness,</i>

2357
02:08:59,858 --> 02:09:02,793
<i>About your disregard
for a society</i>

2358
02:09:02,828 --> 02:09:04,662
<i>That exists
and flourishes</i>

2359
02:09:04,696 --> 02:09:07,098
<i>Because of the strength
of our legal system.</i>

2360
02:09:07,132 --> 02:09:10,201
No one is
above the law.

2361
02:09:12,437 --> 02:09:15,873
<i>You had the audacity to go
on national television,</i>

<i>Show the world
what you did,</i>

2363
02:09:17,576 --> 02:09:19,910
<i>And dare the legal
system to stop you.</i>

2364
02:09:19,945 --> 02:09:23,547
<i>You publicly and repeatedly
announced your intentions</i>

<i>To disregard the

2366
02:09:25,951 --> 02:09:28,686
Because of this,
I am imposing

The maximum sentence
of 10 to 25 years.
