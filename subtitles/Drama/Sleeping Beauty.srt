<i>Many years had they longed for a child,</i>

21

Sweet princess, my gift shall be...

79
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:52,760
Why, it's Maleficent.

80
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:55,663
- What does she want here?
- Shh.

81
00:07:55,664 --> 00:07:59,834
Well, quite a glittering
assemblage, King Stefan.

82
00:08:00,334 --> 00:08:03,071
Royalty, nobility,

83
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:05,809
the gentry and...

84
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,809
How quaint.

85
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,178
Even the rabble.

86
00:08:12,846 --> 00:08:16,182
I really felt quite distressed
at not receiving an invitation.

87
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:18,217
You weren't wanted.

88
00:08:18,218 --> 00:08:19,852
Not want...

89
00:08:19,853 --> 00:08:24,059
Oh, dear, what an awkward situation.

90
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,729
I had hoped it was merely
due to some oversight.

91
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:30,796
Well, in that event, I'd best be on my way.

92
00:08:30,797 --> 00:08:34,570
And, you're not offended, Your Excellency?

93
00:08:34,634 --> 00:08:37,041
Why, no, Your Majesty.

94
00:08:38,205 --> 00:08:40,885
And to show I bear no ill will,

95
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:44,882
I, too, shall bestow a gift on the child.

96
00:08:46,345 --> 00:08:48,957
Listen well, all of you.

97
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:55,424
The princess shall indeed
grow in grace and beauty,

98
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:58,958
beloved by all who know her.

99
00:09:00,658 --> 00:09:01,928
But,

100
00:09:03,229 --> 00:09:06,706
before the sun sets on her 16th birthday,

101
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:09,067
she shall prick her finger

102
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:13,275
<i>on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die!</i>

103
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:14,810
Oh, no!

104
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:18,242
Seize that creature!

105
00:09:18,243 --> 00:09:20,410
Stand back, you fools!

106
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:34,523
Don't despair, Your Majesties.

107
00:09:34,524 --> 00:09:37,170
Merryweather still has her gift to give.

108
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:40,970
Then she can undo this fearful curse?

109
00:09:41,064 --> 00:09:42,598
Oh, no, Sire.

110
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:45,935
Maleficent's powers are far too great.

111
00:09:45,936 --> 00:09:47,843
But she can help.

112
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,107
But...

113
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:52,807
Just do your best, dear.

114
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:54,419
Yes, go on.

115
00:09:55,745 --> 00:10:00,649
Sweet princess, if through
this wicked witch's trick

116
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,285
<i>a spindle should your finger prick,</i>

117
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:06,487
<i>a ray of hope there still may be in this,</i>

118
00:10:06,488 --> 00:10:08,634
<i>the gift I give to thee.</i>

119
00:10:09,457 --> 00:10:12,259
<i>Not in death, but just in sleep.</i>

120
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,728
<i>The fateful prophecy you'll keep.</i>

121
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:17,231
<i>And from this slumber you shall wake,</i>

122
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:21,141
<i>when true love's kiss
the spell shall break.</i>

123
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:25,673
♫ <i>For true love.</i> ♫

124
00:10:25,674 --> 00:10:31,881
♫ <i>Conquers all.</i> ♫

125
00:10:33,148 --> 00:10:34,580
<i>But King Stefan,</i>

126
00:10:34,581 --> 00:10:37,317
<i>still fearful of his daughter's life,</i>

127
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:39,085
<i>did then and there decree</i>

128
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:41,287
<i>that every spinning wheel in the kingdom</i>

129
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:43,872
<i>should on that very day be burned.</i>

130
00:10:44,358 --> 00:10:46,162
<i>So it was done.</i>

131
00:11:02,376 --> 00:11:05,522
Oh, silly fiddle-faddle.

132
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,349
Now, come have a nice cup of tea, dear.

133
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,684
I'm sure it'll work out somehow.

134
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:15,554
Well, a bonfire won't stop Maleficent.

135
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:17,988
Of course not. But what will?

136
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:20,191
Well, perhaps if we reason with her.

137
00:11:20,192 --> 00:11:22,326
- Reason?
- With Maleficent?

138
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:26,407
- Well, she can't be all bad.
- Oh, yes, she can.

139
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:30,634
I'd like to turn her into
a fat, old hop toad.

140
00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:34,003
Now, dear, that isn't a
very nice thing to say.

141
00:11:34,004 --> 00:11:35,372
Besides, we can't.

142
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:37,675
You know our magic doesn't work that way.

143
00:11:37,676 --> 00:11:41,312
It can only do good, dear,
to bring joy and happiness.

144
00:11:41,313 --> 00:11:43,618
Well, that would make me happy.

145
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:45,940
But there must be some way.

146
00:11:47,418 --> 00:11:49,486
- There is!
- There is?

147
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:50,920
What is it, Flora?

148
00:11:50,921 --> 00:11:52,503
I'm going to...

149
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,222
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

150
00:11:54,392 --> 00:11:56,697
Even walls have ears.

151
00:12:00,697 --> 00:12:02,103
Follow me.

152
00:12:17,414 --> 00:12:20,949
- I'll turn her into a flower.
- Maleficent?

153
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,752
No, no, dear, the princess.

154
00:12:23,753 --> 00:12:26,255
Oh, she'd make a lovely flower.

155
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:29,123
Don't you see? A flower
can't prick its finger.

156
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,626
- It hasn't any.
- That's right.

157
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,261
She'll be perfectly safe.

158
00:12:33,262 --> 00:12:35,463
Until Maleficent sends a frost.

159
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,302
Yes...

160
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,434
Oh, dear.

161
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:42,843
She always ruins your nicest flowers.

162
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,438
You're right.

163
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:47,307
And she'll be expecting us
to do something like that.

164
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,446
Well, what won't she expect?
She knows everything.

165
00:12:52,447 --> 00:12:54,448
Oh, but she doesn't, dear.

166
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:57,451
Maleficent doesn't know
anything about love,

167
00:12:57,452 --> 00:13:01,031
or kindness or the joy of helping others.

168
00:13:02,123 --> 00:13:05,759
You know, sometimes I don't
think she's really very happy.

169
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,294
That's it!

170
00:13:07,295 --> 00:13:10,896
Of course. It's the only
thing she can't understand

171
00:13:10,897 --> 00:13:12,565
and won't expect.

172
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:16,469
Now, now, now we'll have
to plan it carefully.

173
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,473
Let's see. The woodcutter's cottage,
yes, yes, the abandoned one.

174
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:23,108
Of course, the King and Queen will object.

175
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:25,577
But when we explain it's the only way...

176
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:27,519
Explain what?

177
00:13:28,848 --> 00:13:32,851
About the three peasant women
raising a foundling child

178
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:34,862
deep in the forest.

179
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:38,131
Oh, that's very nice of them.

180
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:39,824
Who are they?

181
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:41,504
Turn around.

182
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:43,757
Eww!

183
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:45,797
Why, it's us!

184
00:13:45,798 --> 00:13:46,831
Uh-huh.

185
00:13:46,832 --> 00:13:49,267
- You mean, "we" us?
- Uh-huh.

186
00:13:49,268 --> 00:13:50,768
Take care of the baby?

187
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:52,003
Why not?

188
00:13:52,004 --> 00:13:54,505
Oh, I'd like that.

189
00:13:54,506 --> 00:13:56,940
Well, yes, but we'd have to feed it.

190
00:13:56,941 --> 00:14:01,845
And wash it and dress it and rock
it to sleep. Oh, I'd love it.

191
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:03,514
You really think we can?

192
00:14:03,515 --> 00:14:05,816
If humans can do it, so can we.

193
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:08,050
And we'd have our magic to help us.

194
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:09,452
That's right.

195
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:12,224
No, no, no! No magic.

196
00:14:12,523 --> 00:14:15,125
I'll take those wands right now.

197
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:17,528
Oh, better get rid of those wings, too.

198
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:21,631
You mean live like mortals?
For sixteen years?

199
00:14:21,632 --> 00:14:23,065
Uh-huh.

200
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:25,701
Now, now, we don't know how.

201
00:14:25,702 --> 00:14:27,837
We've never done anything without magic.

202
00:14:27,838 --> 00:14:30,172
And that's why Maleficent
will never suspect.

203
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:31,674
But who'll wash?

204
00:14:31,675 --> 00:14:34,043
- And cook?
- Oh, we'll all pitch in.

205
00:14:34,044 --> 00:14:37,281
- I'll take care of the baby.
- Let me have it, dear.

206
00:14:38,214 --> 00:14:42,362
Come along now. We must tell
Their Majesties at once.

207
00:14:45,755 --> 00:14:48,955
- Flora?
- Flora?

208
00:14:54,397 --> 00:14:57,899
<i>So, the King and his queen
watched with heavy hearts</i>

209
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,001
<i>as their most precious possession,</i>

210
00:15:00,002 --> 00:15:03,809
<i>their only child,
disappeared into the night.</i>

211
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:19,124
<i>Many sad and lonely years passed by</i>

212
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,635
<i>for King Stefan and his people.</i>

213
00:15:22,763 --> 00:15:27,070
<i>But as the time for the princess's
16th birthday drew near,</i>

214
00:15:27,101 --> 00:15:29,838
<i>the entire kingdom began to rejoice.</i>

215
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:34,608
<i>For everyone knew that as
long as Maleficent's domain,</i>

216
00:15:34,609 --> 00:15:36,309
<i>the Forbidden Mountains,</i>

217
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,939
<i>thundered with her wrath and frustration,</i>

218
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:42,856
<i>her evil prophecy had
not yet been fulfilled.</i>

219
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,867
It's incredible!

220
00:15:56,896 --> 00:16:00,373
Sixteen years, and not a trace of her!

221
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,674
She couldn't have vanished into thin air!

222
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:07,839
Are you sure you searched everywhere?

223
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,144
Yep, yep, everywhere. We all did.

224
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:13,445
Yes, yes.

225
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:18,157
And what about the town? The forest?
The mountains?

226
00:16:18,517 --> 00:16:21,419
We searched mountains, forests...

227
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,955
And houses and...

228
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:27,035
Let me see. And all the cradles.

229
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:28,326
Cradle?

230
00:16:28,327 --> 00:16:30,327
Yep, yep.

231
00:16:30,328 --> 00:16:32,337
Every cradle.

232
00:16:32,363 --> 00:16:33,906
Cradle!

233
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:37,372
Did you hear that, my pet?

234
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:42,045
All these years they've
been looking for a baby.

235
00:16:54,352 --> 00:16:55,719
Fools!

236
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:59,897
Idiots! Imbeciles!

237
00:17:15,171 --> 00:17:17,238
Oh, they're hopeless.

238
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:20,283
A disgrace to the forces of evil.

239
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,915
My pet. You are my last hope.

240
00:17:27,883 --> 00:17:30,427
Circle far and wide.

241
00:17:30,553 --> 00:17:33,348
Search for a maid of 16,

242
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:38,030
with hair of sunshine gold
and lips red as the rose.

243
00:17:38,561 --> 00:17:42,318
Go, and do not fail me.

244
00:17:47,353 --> 00:17:50,067
<i>And so, for sixteen long years,</i>

245
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:53,571
<i>the whereabouts of the
princess remained a mystery.</i>

246
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,773
<i>While deep in the forest,
in a woodcutter's cottage,</i>

247
00:17:56,774 --> 00:18:00,285
<i>the good fairies carried
out their well-laid plan.</i>

248
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:04,414
<i>Living like mortals, they had
reared the child as their own,</i>

249
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,751
<i>and called her Briar Rose.</i>

250
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:16,693
<i>On this, her 16th birthday, the
good fairies had planned a party.</i>

251
00:18:16,694 --> 00:18:20,569
<i>And something extra special for a surprise.</i>

252
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:22,699
Well, how about this one?

253
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,099
This is the one I picked.

254
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,235
Oh, she'll look beautiful in that.

255
00:18:26,236 --> 00:18:28,771
- Now, I thought a few changes here.
- Uh-huh.

256
00:18:28,772 --> 00:18:30,105
Don't forget a pretty bow.

257
00:18:30,106 --> 00:18:32,441
Yes, and raise the shoulder line.

258
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:34,777
- We'll make it blue.
- Oh, no, dear, pink.

259
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:36,712
- But...
- Of course, we need a few pleats.

260
00:18:36,713 --> 00:18:39,113
Yes, but how are we gonna
get her out of the house?

261
00:18:39,114 --> 00:18:40,381
Oh, I'll think of something.

262
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:45,325
Well, and what are you three dears up to?

263
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,675
- Up to?
- Up to?

264
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:47,599
Up to?

265
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,769
Uh-uh, eh... Well, well, we...

266
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,771
We want you to pick some berries.

267
00:18:53,772 --> 00:18:56,607
- That's it! Berries!
- Berries?

268
00:18:56,608 --> 00:19:00,277
- Lots of berries.
- But I picked berries yesterday.

269
00:19:00,278 --> 00:19:02,579
Oh, we need more, dear.

270
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,448
Lots, lots more.

271
00:19:04,449 --> 00:19:05,752
Yes.

272
00:19:07,117 --> 00:19:10,219
- Now, don't hurry back, dear.
- But don't go too far.

273
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,821
And don't speak to strangers.

274
00:19:11,822 --> 00:19:12,989
Goodbye, dear.

275
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,390
- Good bye.
- Goodbye.

276
00:19:14,391 --> 00:19:15,831
Goodbye.

277
00:19:17,795 --> 00:19:19,628
I wonder if she suspects.

278
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:22,130
Of course not. Come on.

279
00:19:22,131 --> 00:19:24,801
Oh, will she be surprised.

280
00:19:24,802 --> 00:19:28,771
- A real birthday party.
- With a real birthday cake.

281
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:32,141
Yes, and a dress a
princess can be proud of.

282
00:19:32,142 --> 00:19:33,643
I'll get the wands.

283
00:19:33,644 --> 00:19:36,311
Yes, you can... The wands?

284
00:19:36,312 --> 00:19:37,579
Oh, no!

285
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,080
No magic!

286
00:19:39,081 --> 00:19:41,449
But the sixteen years are almost over.

287
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,585
We're taking no chances.

288
00:19:43,586 --> 00:19:46,755
But I've never baked a fancy cake.

289
00:19:46,756 --> 00:19:48,823
Oh, you won't have to, dear.

290
00:19:48,824 --> 00:19:50,991
I'm going to bake the cake.

291
00:19:50,992 --> 00:19:53,828
- You?
- Now, she's always wanted to, dear.

292
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:56,130
- And this is her last chance.
- Well...

293
00:19:56,131 --> 00:20:00,100
I'm going to make it 15 layers
with pink and blue forget-me-nots.

294
00:20:00,101 --> 00:20:02,670
And I'm making the dress.

295
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:05,546
But you can't sew, and she's never cooked.

296
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:09,483
- It's simple.
- All you do is follow the book.

297
00:20:09,678 --> 00:20:13,223
Up here, dear. You can be the dummy.

298
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:16,522
Well, I still say we ought to use magic.

299
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:26,068
"Flour, three cups."

300
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,535
Cups, cups, cups.

301
00:20:29,797 --> 00:20:30,996
Oh.

302
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:35,505
One, two, three.

303
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,369
What's that for?

304
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,872
Well, it's got to have
a hole in the bottom.

305
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:42,452
That's for the feet to go through.

306
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:48,881
- It's pink!
- Oh, lovely shade, isn't it?

307
00:20:48,882 --> 00:20:50,849
But I wanted it blue.

308
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,427
Now, dear,

309
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,853
we decided pink was her color.

310
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:56,590
You decided!

311
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,274
"Two eggs, fold in gently."

312
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,405
Fold? Oh, well.

313
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:22,119
I can't breathe!

314
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,261
Let me out of here.

315
00:21:27,885 --> 00:21:30,964
- It looks awful.
- That's because it's on you, dear.

316
00:21:31,455 --> 00:21:33,657
Now, yeast, "1 tsp."

317
00:21:34,025 --> 00:21:35,091
Tsp.?

318
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:36,794
One teaspoon.

319
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:39,634
Oh, one teaspoon, of course.

320
00:21:46,703 --> 00:21:49,907
Oh, gracious, how that child has grown.

321
00:21:50,106 --> 00:21:53,583
Oh, it seems only yesterday
we brought her here.

322
00:21:53,944 --> 00:21:55,816
Just a tiny baby.

323
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:02,718
- Why, Merryweather.
- Whatever is the matter, dear?

324
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:05,788
After today she'll be a princess,

325
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:08,724
and we won't have any Briar Rose.

326
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:10,992
- Oh, Flora.
- Now, now, now.

327
00:22:10,993 --> 00:22:14,538
Well, we all knew this day had to come.

328
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,610
But why did it have to come so soon?

329
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:21,637
After all, we've had her for sixteen years.

330
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:24,304
Sixteen wonderful years.

331
00:22:27,675 --> 00:22:31,049
Oh, gracious! We're acting
like a lot of ninnies.

332
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,551
Come on. She'll be back
before we get started.

333
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:23,460
You hear that, Samson?

334
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,220
Beautiful.

335
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:31,470
What is it?

336
00:24:32,094 --> 00:24:34,240
Come on. Let's find out.

337
00:24:36,053 --> 00:24:37,425
Ah, come on.

338
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,106
For an extra bucket of oats?

339
00:24:40,803 --> 00:24:42,983
And a few carrots?

340
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:45,846
Hup, boy!

341
00:25:15,878 --> 00:25:17,846
Whoa!

342
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,825
No carrots.

Why do they still treat me like a child?

360
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,635
Who?

361
00:26:58,601 --> 00:27:02,772
Aunt Flora and Fauna and Merryweather.

362
00:27:04,673 --> 00:27:07,285
They never want me to meet anyone.

363
00:27:11,754 --> 00:27:14,082
But you know something?

364
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:18,019
I fooled them. I have met someone.

365
00:27:19,188 --> 00:27:20,458
Who?

366
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:25,270
Who? Who?

367
00:27:26,427 --> 00:27:28,470
Oh... A prince.

368
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,641
Well, he's tall and handsome and...

369
00:27:35,603 --> 00:27:37,570
And so romantic.

370
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:43,980
Oh, we walk together and talk together.

371
00:27:45,112 --> 00:27:47,622
And just before we say goodbye,

372
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:50,951
he takes me in his arms,

373
00:27:51,418 --> 00:27:52,752
and then...

374
00:27:54,554 --> 00:27:56,324
I wake up.

375
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,323
Yes, it's only in my dreams.

376
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,164
But they say if you dream
a thing more than once,

377
00:28:06,165 --> 00:28:08,345
it's sure to come true.

378
00:28:08,401 --> 00:28:11,275
And I've seen him so many times.

379
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:54,680
You know, Samson,

380
00:28:55,346 --> 00:28:58,527
there was something
strange about that voice.

381
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:01,656
Too beautiful to be real.

382
00:29:02,885 --> 00:29:07,023
Maybe it was a mysterious
being, a wood sprite, or...

383
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,739
Here, stop!

384
00:29:42,124 --> 00:29:45,365
Why, it's my dream prince.

385
00:29:48,148 --> 00:29:49,850
Your Highness.

386
00:29:56,905 --> 00:30:00,240
You know, I'm really not
supposed to speak to strangers.

387
00:30:00,241 --> 00:30:02,284

Why, it's, it's...

430
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:42,095
Oh, no, no. I can't. I...

431
00:32:42,863 --> 00:32:45,266
- Goodbye.
- But when will I see you again?

432
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:47,166
Oh, never, never!

433
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:48,867
Never?

434
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:52,604
- Well, maybe someday.
- When? Tomorrow?

435
00:32:52,605 --> 00:32:55,540
Oh, no! This evening!

436
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:58,984
- Where?
- At the cottage in the glen.

437
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:09,087
There.

438
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,628
Well, what do you think of it?

439
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:19,229
Why, it's...

440
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,399
It's a very unusual cake, isn't it?

441
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,491
Yes. Of course, it'll be much
stiffer after it's baked.

442
00:33:26,492 --> 00:33:28,103
Of course, dear.

443
00:33:29,086 --> 00:33:30,560
What do you think of the dress?

444
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:32,450
Well, it's...

445
00:33:32,597 --> 00:33:36,233
It's not exactly the way
it is in the book, is it?

446
00:33:36,234 --> 00:33:41,475
Oh, I improved it. But perhaps
if I added a few more ruffles...

447
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,386
- What do you think?
- I think so.

448
00:33:46,043 --> 00:33:48,044
What do you think, Merryweather?

449
00:33:48,045 --> 00:33:51,715
I think we've had enough of this nonsense!

450
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:56,425
I think we ought to think of Rose
and what she'll think of this mess.

451
00:33:56,754 --> 00:33:59,355
I still think what I thunk before.

452
00:33:59,356 --> 00:34:01,797
I'm going to get those wands.

453
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:07,025
You know, I think she's right.

454
00:34:07,931 --> 00:34:10,577
Here they are, good as new!

455
00:34:10,578 --> 00:34:12,101
Ah-ah-ah ah!

456
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:13,845
Careful, Merryweather.

457
00:34:14,603 --> 00:34:16,680
Quick, lock the doors.

458
00:34:17,607 --> 00:34:19,608
Fauna, you close the windows.

459
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:22,445
Oh, block up every cranny.

460
00:34:22,446 --> 00:34:24,683
We can't take any chances.

461
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:28,616
And now, you take care of the cake.

462
00:34:28,617 --> 00:34:30,985
- While I...
- Clean the room, dear.

463
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:33,621
And I'll make the dress.

464
00:34:33,622 --> 00:34:36,049
- Now hurry!
- Ooh!

465
00:34:37,793 --> 00:34:40,337
Come on, bucket, mop, broom.

466
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:42,801
Flora says, clean up the room.

467
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,656
And now to make a lovely dress,

468
00:34:54,691 --> 00:34:57,235
fit to grace a fair princess.

469
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:01,486
Eggs, flour...

470
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:06,392
Just do it like it says here in the book.
I'll put on the candles.

471
00:36:01,138 --> 00:36:03,074
Oh, no, not pink.

472
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:05,115
Make it blue.

473
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:07,449
Merryweather!

474
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:09,247
Make it pink.

475
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:14,612
Make it blue.

476
00:36:16,938 --> 00:36:18,173
Pink!

477
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,061
Blue.

478
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:17,425
Oh! Now look what you've done!

479
00:37:18,562 --> 00:37:20,867
Shh. Listen.

480
00:37:21,293 --> 00:37:23,795
- It's Rose.
- She's back.

481
00:37:23,796 --> 00:37:26,135
Enough of this foolishness.

482
00:37:29,168 --> 00:37:32,008
Make it pink. Now, hide, quick!

483
00:37:35,474 --> 00:37:36,774
Blue.

484
00:37:36,775 --> 00:37:38,682
Aunt Flora!

485
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:44,122
Good gracious! Who left the mop running?

486
00:37:45,251 --> 00:37:47,080
Stop, mop.

487
00:37:49,253 --> 00:37:52,957
Aunt Flora, Fauna, Merryweather.

488
00:37:56,427 --> 00:37:57,928
Where is everybody?

489
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,596
Oh!

490
00:38:00,597 --> 00:38:02,965
= Surprise! Surprise!
- Surprise!

491
00:38:02,966 --> 00:38:04,600
Happy birthday!

492
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:06,202
Oh, you darlings.

493
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:09,005
This is the happiest day of my life.

494
00:38:09,006 --> 00:38:13,383
Everything's so wonderful.
Just wait till you meet him.

495
00:38:13,778 --> 00:38:15,752
- Him?
- Rose.

496
00:38:16,279 --> 00:38:18,714
You've met some stranger?

497
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:22,218
Oh, he's not a stranger. We've met before.

498
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:24,387
- You have?
- Where?

499
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:26,363
Once upon a dream.

500
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:29,524
♪ <i>I know you.</i> ♪

501
00:38:29,525 --> 00:38:33,935
♪ <i>I walked with you once upon a dream.</i> ♪

502
00:38:35,197 --> 00:38:37,001
She's in love.

503
00:38:37,366 --> 00:38:39,705
- Oh, no.
- This is terrible.

504
00:38:40,503 --> 00:38:43,804
Why? After all, I am sixteen.

505
00:38:43,805 --> 00:38:45,372
It isn't that, dear.

506
00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:48,575
- You're already betrothed.
- Betrothed?

507
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,378
Since the day you were born.

508
00:38:50,379 --> 00:38:52,380
To Prince Phillip, dear.

509
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:56,484
But that's impossible. How
could I marry a prince?

510
00:38:56,485 --> 00:38:58,419
- I'd have to be...
- A princess.

511
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,853
And you are, dear.

512
00:38:59,854 --> 00:39:01,889
Princess Aurora.

513
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:05,826
Tonight, we're taking you back
to your father, King Stefan.

514
00:39:05,827 --> 00:39:09,873
But... But I can't. He's
coming here tonight.

515
00:39:10,198 --> 00:39:11,998
I promised to meet him.

516
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:13,803
I'm sorry, child,

517
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:17,070
but you must never see
that young man again.

518
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:19,751
Oh, no! No!

519
00:39:20,207 --> 00:39:21,774
I can't believe it!

520
00:39:21,775 --> 00:39:23,977
No!

521
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:31,987
And we thought she'd be so happy.

522
00:39:47,366 --> 00:39:49,637
No sign of her yet, Hubert.

523
00:39:50,403 --> 00:39:51,980
Course not.

524
00:39:52,438 --> 00:39:55,015
It's a good half hour till sunset.

525
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:00,923
Excellent bird.

526
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:05,249
Oh, now, come, man!

527
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,886
Buck up! Battle's over!

528
00:40:07,887 --> 00:40:10,054
Girl's as good as here.

529
00:40:10,055 --> 00:40:14,658
I'm sorry, Hubert, but after
sixteen years of worrying,

530
00:40:14,659 --> 00:40:16,794
- never knowing...
- The past!

531
00:40:16,795 --> 00:40:18,599
All in the past.

532
00:40:24,768 --> 00:40:27,505
Tonight, we toast the future,

533
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:31,274
with something I've been
saving for sixteen years.

534
00:40:34,678 --> 00:40:37,746
Here, to the future.

535
00:40:37,747 --> 00:40:40,015

Nothing elaborate, of course.

Forty bedrooms, dining hall.

Honeymoon cottage, really.

Tomorrow? But, Hubert, they're
not even married yet.

563
00:42:17,509 --> 00:42:19,410
Take care of that tonight.

564
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:22,013
- To the wedding!
- Now, hold on, Hubert.

565
00:42:22,014 --> 00:42:24,415
I haven't even seen my daughter yet,

566
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,451
and you're taking her away from me.

567
00:42:26,452 --> 00:42:28,052
Getting my Phillip, aren't you?

568
00:42:28,053 --> 00:42:29,120
Yes, but...

569
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:31,188
Want to see our grandchildren, don't we?

570
00:42:31,189 --> 00:42:34,024
- Of course, but...
- There's no time to lose.

571
00:42:34,025 --> 00:42:35,425
Getting on in years.

572
00:42:37,362 --> 00:42:38,595
To the wedding!

573
00:42:38,596 --> 00:42:40,797
Now, be reasonable, Hubert.

574
00:42:40,798 --> 00:42:44,434
After all, Aurora knows
nothing about all this.

575
00:42:44,435 --> 00:42:45,535
Well?

576
00:42:45,536 --> 00:42:49,139
Well, it may come as quite a shock.

577
00:42:50,215 --> 00:42:51,540
Shock?

578
00:42:51,643 --> 00:42:53,652
My Phillip, a shock?

579
00:42:54,112 --> 00:42:56,780
What's wrong with my Phillip?

580
00:42:56,781 --> 00:42:59,415
Nothing, Hubert. I only meant...

581
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:02,585
Why doesn't your daughter like my son?

582
00:43:02,586 --> 00:43:05,721
- Now, now...
- I'm not so sure

583
00:43:05,722 --> 00:43:08,457
my son likes your daughter!

584
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:12,128
- Now, see here.
- I'm not so sure my grandchildren

585
00:43:12,129 --> 00:43:14,596
want you for a grandfather!

586
00:43:14,597 --> 00:43:17,832
Why, you, you unreasonable,

587
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:20,669
pompous, blustering, old windbag!

588
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:23,806
Unreasonable, pompous, <i>en garde</i>, sir!

589
00:43:23,807 --> 00:43:26,642
I warn you, Hubert. This means war.

590
00:43:26,643 --> 00:43:31,120
Forward! For honor! For country! For...

591
00:43:39,121 --> 00:43:41,162
What's this all about anyway?

592
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:45,192
Nothing, Hubert. Absolutely nothing.

593
00:43:45,193 --> 00:43:48,028
Children bound to fall
in love with each other.

594
00:43:48,029 --> 00:43:50,831
Precisely. And as for grandchildren,

595
00:43:50,832 --> 00:43:55,134
I'll have the royal woodcarvers
start work on the cradle tomorrow.

596
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:57,837
Splendid! King-size, of course.

597
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:00,606
Certainly. To the woodcarvers' guild.

598
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:18,594
<i>His royal highness Prince Phillip!</i>

599
00:44:18,859 --> 00:44:20,059
Phillip?

600
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:28,876
Phillip! Phillip!

601
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:32,246
Phil, ho, Phillip!

602
00:44:38,543 --> 00:44:40,724
Hurry, boy, hurry.

603
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:42,714
Change into something suitable.

604
00:44:42,715 --> 00:44:45,250
Can't meet your future
bride looking like that.

605
00:44:45,251 --> 00:44:47,085
But I have met her, Father.

606
00:44:47,086 --> 00:44:48,887
You have? Where?

607
00:44:48,888 --> 00:44:50,422
Once upon a dream.

608
00:44:51,657 --> 00:44:54,859
Oh, Phillip, stop it. Stop that! Phillip!

609
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,801
Put me down.

610
00:44:57,162 --> 00:45:00,231
Now, what's all this dream nonsense?

611
00:45:00,232 --> 00:45:03,167
It wasn't a dream, Father.
I really did meet her.

612
00:45:03,168 --> 00:45:04,568
Princess Aurora?

613
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:06,536
Good heavens, we must tell Stefan.

614
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,572
- Why, this is the most...
- I didn't say it was Aurora.

615
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,374
You most certainly did. You said...

616
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,877
I said, I met the girl
I was going to marry.

617
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:16,579
I don't know who she was.
A peasant girl, I suppose.

618
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,549
A peasant girl?

619
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:22,185
You're going to marry a... Why, Phillip.

620
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:24,332
You're joking.

621
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:28,933
Isn't he?

622
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:34,008
No! You can't do this to me!

623
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:38,944
Give up the throne, the
kingdom, for some, some nobody?

624
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,574
By Harry, I won't have it!

625
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:45,407
You're a prince, and you're
going to marry a princess!

626
00:45:45,408 --> 00:45:47,409
Now, Father, you're living in the past.

627
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,544
This is the 14th century. Nowadays...

628
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:51,913
Nowadays, I'm still the king

629
00:45:51,914 --> 00:45:54,148
and I command you to come to your senses!

630
00:45:54,149 --> 00:45:56,117
- And marry the girl I love.
- Exactly!

631
00:45:56,118 --> 00:45:58,120
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye, Father.

632
00:45:58,121 --> 00:45:59,955
Marry the girl you... No, no!

633
00:45:59,956 --> 00:46:02,790
No, no, Phillip! Stop! Come back!

634
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:04,368
Oh, Phillip!

635
00:46:09,331 --> 00:46:11,533
Phillip!

636
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:32,785
Oh, ho.

637
00:46:32,786 --> 00:46:35,466
Oh, how will I ever tell Stefan?

638
00:47:22,201 --> 00:47:23,937
Come along now.

639
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,754
All right. In here, dear.

640
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,421
Bolt the door, Merryweather.

641
00:47:45,422 --> 00:47:47,568
Fauna, pull the drapes.

642
00:47:48,425 --> 00:47:51,765
And now, dear, if you'll just sit here.

643
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:56,775
This one last gift, dear child, for thee.

644
00:47:57,901 --> 00:48:00,103
The symbol of thy royalty.

645
00:48:01,071 --> 00:48:04,411
A crown to wear in grace and beauty

646
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:07,954
as is thy right and royal duty.

647
00:48:12,548 --> 00:48:14,284
Now, dear...

648
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,054
Come.

649
00:48:18,254 --> 00:48:20,798
Let her have a few moments alone.

650
00:48:21,724 --> 00:48:23,733
It's that boy she met.

651
00:48:23,893 --> 00:48:25,901
Whatever are we going to do?

652
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,344
Oh, I don't see why she has
to marry any old prince.

653
00:49:11,471 --> 00:49:14,949
Now, that's not for us to decide, dear.

654
00:49:26,653 --> 00:49:30,088
Maybe we should tell
King Stefan about the boy.

655
00:49:30,089 --> 00:49:31,490
Well, why don't we?

656
00:49:31,491 --> 00:49:35,161
Listen! Maleficent! Rose!

657
00:49:35,361 --> 00:49:36,664
Rose!

658
00:49:37,462 --> 00:49:39,764
Oh, why did we leave her alone?

659
00:49:39,765 --> 00:49:41,535
- Rose!
- Rose!

660
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,358
Here.

661
00:50:03,655 --> 00:50:05,094
Rose!

662
00:50:05,523 --> 00:50:08,727
Rose, Rose, where are you?

663
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:16,742
Rose!

664
00:50:30,815 --> 00:50:32,321
Rose!

665
00:50:32,816 --> 00:50:34,086
Rose!

666
00:50:45,028 --> 00:50:46,604
- Rose!
- Rose!

667
00:50:57,072 --> 00:50:58,172
Rose!

668
00:50:58,173 --> 00:51:00,943
Rose, don't touch anything!

669
00:51:03,277 --> 00:51:05,616
Touch the spindle.

670
00:51:05,847 --> 00:51:07,720
Touch it, I say!

671
00:51:12,354 --> 00:51:15,659
You poor, simple fools,

672
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:17,924
thinking you would defeat me!

673
00:51:17,925 --> 00:51:21,299
Me! The mistress of all evil!

674
00:51:22,597 --> 00:51:26,335
Well, here's your precious princess!

675
00:51:32,773 --> 00:51:35,146
- Rose.
- Oh, Rose.

676
00:51:35,742 --> 00:51:40,584
Oh, I'll never forgive myself.

677
00:51:41,281 --> 00:51:43,983
We're all to blame.

678
00:51:52,726 --> 00:51:54,260
Stefan, there's...

679
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:57,396
There's something important
I have to tell you.

680
00:51:57,397 --> 00:51:58,963
Not now, Hubert.

681
00:51:58,964 --> 00:52:00,965
But it's about Phillip.

682
00:52:00,966 --> 00:52:04,010
Phillip? Oh, yes, of course, Phillip.

683
00:52:04,136 --> 00:52:06,137
Why, where is the boy?

684
00:52:06,138 --> 00:52:08,273
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

685
00:52:08,274 --> 00:52:10,021
Well, send for
him immediately!

686
00:52:10,047 --> 00:52:11,548
- But...
- Shh!

687
00:52:14,479 --> 00:52:16,680
The sun has set!

688
00:52:16,681 --> 00:52:20,328
Make ready to welcome your princess!

689
00:53:21,077 --> 00:53:24,348
Poor King Stefan and the Queen.

690
00:53:24,646 --> 00:53:27,588
They'll be heartbroken when they find out.

691
00:53:30,218 --> 00:53:33,587
- They're not going to.
- They aren't? But...

692
00:53:33,588 --> 00:53:37,735
We'll put them all to
sleep until Rose awakens.

693
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,058
Come.

694

695

♫ <i>Sleep on.</i> ♫

713
00:55:35,337 --> 00:55:38,518
Well, just been talking to Phillip.

714
00:55:38,941 --> 00:55:43,522
Seems he's fallen in love
with some peasant girl.

715
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,324
Peasant girl?

716
00:55:46,215 --> 00:55:48,088
Yes? Yes?

717
00:55:49,818 --> 00:55:50,985
The peasant girl?

718
00:55:50,986 --> 00:55:53,223
Who is she? Where did he meet her?

719
00:55:53,655 --> 00:55:56,524
Just some peasant girl he met...

720
00:55:56,525 --> 00:55:58,292
Where? Where?

721
00:55:58,293 --> 00:56:02,372
Once upon a dream.

722
00:56:02,864 --> 00:56:04,731
Once upon a...

723
00:56:04,732 --> 00:56:07,412
Rose! Prince Phillip!

724
00:56:12,673 --> 00:56:16,115
Come on. We've got to get
back to the cottage.

725
00:57:03,089 --> 00:57:04,563
Come in.

726
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:35,922
Well!

727
00:57:36,888 --> 00:57:39,590
This is a pleasant surprise.

728
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:45,940
I set my trap for a peasant
and, lo, I catch a prince!

729
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,304
Away with him.

730
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:55,008
But gently, my pets. Gently.

731
00:57:56,772 --> 00:58:00,510
I have plans for our royal guest.

732
00:58:33,278 --> 00:58:35,141
≡ Maleficent!

733
00:58:35,142 --> 00:58:37,253
She's got Prince Phillip.

734
00:58:37,623 --> 00:58:39,606
At the Forbidden Mountain.

735
00:58:40,748 --> 00:58:43,723
But we can't, we can't go there.

736
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:46,724
We can, and we must!

737
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:11,657
What a pity Prince Phillip can't be here

738
01:01:11,658 --> 01:01:13,793
to enjoy the celebration.

739
01:01:16,496 --> 01:01:17,868
Come.

740
01:01:17,964 --> 01:01:21,043
We must go to the dungeon and cheer him up.

741
01:02:14,819 --> 01:02:17,388
Oh, come now, Prince Phillip.

742
01:02:17,389 --> 01:02:19,466
Why so melancholy?

743
01:02:20,258 --> 01:02:23,199
A wondrous future lies before you.

744
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:26,562
You, the destined hero

745
01:02:26,563 --> 01:02:29,972
of a charming fairy tale come true.

746
01:02:34,338 --> 01:02:37,780
Behold, King Stefan's castle.

747
01:02:38,408 --> 01:02:40,815
And in yonder topmost tower

748
01:02:40,943 --> 01:02:43,384
dreaming of her true love,

749
01:02:43,946 --> 01:02:46,786
the Princess Aurora.

750
01:02:48,085 --> 01:02:50,787
But see the gracious whim of fate.

751
01:02:51,387 --> 01:02:54,756
Why, 'tis the selfsame peasant maid

752
01:02:54,757 --> 01:02:58,734
who won the heart of our
noble prince but yesterday.

753
01:03:01,731 --> 01:03:06,283
She is indeed most wondrous fair.

754
01:03:07,035 --> 01:03:09,738
Gold of sunshine in her hair.

755
01:03:10,105 --> 01:03:13,514
Lips that shame the red, red rose.

756
01:03:14,543 --> 01:03:19,157
In ageless sleep she finds repose.

757
01:03:21,148 --> 01:03:23,235
The years roll by.

758
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:28,333
But 100 years to a steadfast
heart are but a day.

759
01:03:28,957 --> 01:03:32,661
And now, the gates of the dungeon part

760
01:03:32,927 --> 01:03:36,597
and our prince is free to go his way.

761
01:03:37,465 --> 01:03:41,442
Off he rides on his noble steed,

762
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:45,940
a valiant figure, straight and tall,

763
01:03:46,073 --> 01:03:48,173
to wake his love

764
01:03:48,174 --> 01:03:51,355
with love's first kiss

765
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:57,512
and prove that true love conquers all!

766
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,062
Why, you, you...

767
01:04:06,659 --> 01:04:08,160
Come, my pet.

768
01:04:08,161 --> 01:04:12,707
Let us leave our noble prince
with these happy thoughts.

769
01:04:17,636 --> 01:04:20,407
A most gratifying day.

770
01:04:25,477 --> 01:04:28,779
For the first time in sixteen years

771
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:31,050
I shall sleep well.

772
01:04:47,365 --> 01:04:48,398
Shh!

773
01:04:48,399 --> 01:04:50,374
No time to explain.

774
01:04:59,009 --> 01:05:00,876
Wait, Prince Phillip.

775
01:05:00,877 --> 01:05:05,080
The road to true love may be
barred by still many more dangers

776
01:05:05,081 --> 01:05:07,550
which you alone will have to face.

777
01:05:07,551 --> 01:05:11,198
So arm thyself with this
enchanted Shield of Virtue.

778
01:05:12,221 --> 01:05:14,731
And this mighty Sword of Truth.

779
01:05:15,491 --> 01:05:19,400
For these weapons of righteousness
will triumph over evil.

780
01:05:19,929 --> 01:05:21,841
Now, come. We must hurry.

781
01:06:09,743 --> 01:06:11,269
Phillip, watch out!

782
01:07:08,165 --> 01:07:09,639
Silence!

783
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,169
You, tell those fools to... No!

784
01:07:13,615 --> 01:07:14,807
No!

785
01:07:19,309 --> 01:07:21,420
Watch out, Phillip!

786
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:31,228
Hurry! Hurry, Phillip!

787
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,606
A forest of thorns shall be his tomb.

788
01:07:48,103 --> 01:07:51,401
Borne through the skies on a fog of doom!

789
01:07:51,673 --> 01:07:55,142
Now go with a curse and serve me well.

790
01:07:55,143 --> 01:07:59,503
Around Stefan's castle, cast my spell!

791
01:08:49,596 --> 01:08:52,106
No! It cannot be!

792
01:08:58,471 --> 01:09:02,174
Now shall you deal with me, O Prince.

793
01:09:02,407 --> 01:09:05,959
And all the powers of hell!

794
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:52,328
Up! Up this way!

795
01:10:08,672 --> 01:10:11,673
Now, Sword of Truth, fly swift and sure.

796
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:14,753
That evil die and good endure!

797
01:11:57,242 --> 01:11:59,310
Oh, uh...

798
01:11:59,311 --> 01:12:02,933
Forgive me, Hubert. The wine. Now...

799
01:12:02,934 --> 01:12:05,114
You were saying?

800
01:12:05,115 --> 01:12:06,282
Huh?

801
01:12:06,283 --> 01:12:08,759
I was? Oh, yes.

802
01:12:09,646 --> 01:12:14,557
Well, after all, Stefan,
this is the 14th century.

803
01:12:14,558 --> 01:12:17,993
Yes. You said that a moment ago.

804
01:12:17,994 --> 01:12:20,697
Well, to come right to the point.

805
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:23,966
My son Phillip says he's going to marry...

806
01:12:49,491 --> 01:12:51,967
It's Aurora! She's here!

807
01:12:56,498 --> 01:12:58,541
And Phillip!

808
01:13:14,548 --> 01:13:16,516
What does this mean, boy?

809
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:18,492
I don't...

810
01:13:22,156 --> 01:13:23,835
But...

811
01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:32,941
I don't understand.

812
01:13:57,723 --> 01:14:00,529
Why, Fauna. What's the matter, dear?

813
01:14:00,993 --> 01:14:04,929
Oh, I just love happy endings.

814
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:07,432
Yes, I do, too.

815
01:14:08,807 --> 01:14:10,514
Blue?

816
01:14:14,338 --> 01:14:15,672
Pink!

817

♫ <i>I know you.</i> ♫

818

♫ <i>I walked with you.</i> ♫

819

♫ <i>I know you.</i> ♫

823

♫ <i>The gleam in your eyes.</i> ♫

824
01:14:28,586 --> 01:14:31,922
♫ <i>Is so familiar a gleam.</i> ♫
