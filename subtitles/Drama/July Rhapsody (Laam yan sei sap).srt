00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,420
<i>Building of the Old Summer Palace started in 1709.</i>

2
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,640
<i>Took more than 150 years to complete.</i>

3
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,060
<i>Its magnificence awed the world.</i>

4
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,550
<i>Envoys called it The Garden of Gardens.</i>

5
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,640
<i>Haiyan Hall was its largest Western mansion,</i>

6
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,140
<i>where the 12 Chinese Zodiac statues stood,</i>

7
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,980
<i>each majestically spouting water at noon!</i>

8
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,020
<i>Foreign armies breached Fort Dagu in July 1860,</i>

9
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,880
<i>shattered the Empire's feeble defense.</i>

10
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,840
<i>On 6th October 1860,</i>

11
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,310
<i>the invaders stormed Old Summer Palace.</i>

12
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,350
<i>Imperial treasures including the 12 bronze statues</i>

13
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,720
<i>were pillaged or burned.</i>

14
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,050
<i>The fire lasted for three nights and days.</i>

15
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,720
<i>This 150-year-old architectural masterpiece</i>

16
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,930
<i>was razed to the ground.</i>

17
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,970
<i>One, two, three!</i>

18
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,720
Going once, going twice,

19
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,720
Sold!

20
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,930
Next item.

21
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,130
A case of 24 bottles of
Chinese Maotai perfectly preserved,

22
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,470
forgotten in a farm cellar for over 55 years.

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,010
Maotai's starting bid: 2 million euros,

24
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,560
bids in increments of 100,000.

25
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,680
Ladies and gentlemen,

26
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,300
there are only four in the world.

27
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,310
The Chinese ambassador.

28
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,720
A pleasure to meet you.

29
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,930
Please forgive my lateness, I'm sorry.

30
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,970
We should be the ones to ask your forgiveness.

31
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,260
Take a look at the edges.

32
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,430
All those years ago, because of the war,

33
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,350
my ancestors brought back things
that did not belong to them.

34
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,310
And every time I look at that bronze,

35
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,640
I feel guilty.

36
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,270
It's part of the common heritage of mankind.

37
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,680
It shouldn't belong to one or two individuals.

38
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,980
That's why I chose
to donate it to a Chinese museum.

39
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,590
Sir it's my humble opinion,

40
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,560
that if everybody thinks like you,

41
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,140
the world would be a better place to live in.

42
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,590
I wish you every success

43
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,390
in tracking down the rest of the bronze heads.

44
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,310
8.8,

45
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,800
and sold!

46
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,930
7 million!

47
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,140
Sold!

48
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,350
Congratulations, Mr. Morgan.

49
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,810
MP Corporation is now the proud owner
of the world's four rarest stamps

50
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,680
You're wrong. Not four.

51
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,270
Now,

52
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,510
there is only one in the world!

53
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,890
Hey! Check it out!
MP Corporation is all over the news today.

54
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,010
Oh! The boss is back.

55
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,310
It's the only one of its kind left.

56
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,430
Its values go triple overnight.

57
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,520
Father's idea.

58
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,510
Genius!

59
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,260
You want a priceless antique?
I'll make it for you.

60
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,230
Next!

61
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,140
Percy's called, questioning our painting
Morning Light.

62
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,130
Questioning?

63
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,980
Well then, they don't even know to do that.

64
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,600
Buy it back, like we always do,
for an elevated price.

65
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,260
Because fake things tend to become more real

66
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,810
once they've been bought and sold a few times

67
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,720
Next!

68
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,770
The 5th bronze head did very well.
It was a surprise to us.

69
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,340
Recent buyers this auction season
were all businessmen

70
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,640
who just love their country.

71
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,220
That's because they'll do anything
for their own relics.

72
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,970
Their patriotism equals our profit.

73
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,060
Genius!

74
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,550
These bronzes,

75
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,550
each one higher than the last.

76
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,140
How am I going to get my hands
on those bad boys?

77
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,260
Names, give me names. Throw out names.

78
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,630
Let's get the Vulture.

79
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,810
Feels like it should be someone closer to home.

80
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,390
What about JC?

81
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,560
He hasn't even found the Roses painting yet.

82
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,430
Roses? Don't worry about the Roses.

83
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,140
You tell JC,

84
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,560
if he can get me all the remaining heads,

85
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,720
there's a massive bonus in it for him.

86
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,680
As long as the money's right,

87
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,720
JC will get you anything.

88
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,970
You tell him it's one million euros each.

89
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,060
If he gets us the dragon as well,

90
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,430
I'll add another zero.

91
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,550
Genius!

92
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,480
Your car cannot pass!

93
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,510
I want to pee.

94
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,880
She's gorgeous!

95
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,050
Please.

96
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,060
Come this way.

97
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,430
Thank you.

98
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,730
Dad, that's brilliant.

99
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,390
You know, it's the Year of the Dragon.

100
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,980
- We're going to make a fortune.
-Go fool around with your girls!

101
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,930
You go find JC, then

102
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,220
No problem, I'll find him.

103
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,010
Right, where is he now?

104
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,100
He's probably on vacation.

105
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,430
What's going on?

106
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,970
I don't get this.

107
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,340
What happened?

108
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,220
There's a breach. Be alert!

109
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,810
What is it?

110
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,640
Someone has broken in!

111
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,850
What's going on?

112
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,260
Stop him!

113
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,310
Stop or we will shoot!

114
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,890
Get him!

115
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,140
There's a breach, don't let him get away!

116
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,260
Where are the keys?

117
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,590
Get him!

118
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,680
This way!

119
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,060
He's under the car, get him!

120
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,180
He's here!

121
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,260
He's here!

122
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,300
Get him!

123
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,550
Shoot!

124
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,760
Hurry!

125
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,890
I can't see him. Can he out-race us?

126
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,640
I can see our cars but nothing else.

127
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,690
Where is he? I thought you'd cut him off.

128
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,390
What is this?

129
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,380
Get him!

130
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,260
What's that?

131
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,800
He is there!

132
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,980
Oh my poor backside!

133
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,140
Shoot!

134
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,140
JC, okay?

135
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,060
Go!

136
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,430
Let's go.

137
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,260
Hello?

138
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,390
JC, it's Jonathan.

139
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,390
Did you find the Roses?

140
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,680
I am on vacation.

141
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,930
I have a new assignment. Interested?

142
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,300
How much do you pay?

143
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,970
You know the 12 bronze heads from Old Summer Palace?

144
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,340
Chinese Zodiac?

145
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,600
Chinese Zodiac

146
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,770
<i>Professor Guan.</i>

147
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,760
<i>Martin is from National Geographic Channel.</i>

148
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:28,760
<i>This is Professor Guan.</i>

149
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,430
<i>How are you, sir? How do you do?</i>

150
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,010
National Geographic Channel is very respectable.

151
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,510
We need plenty of support for our work.

152
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,760
Especially

153
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,890
support from credible media like yours.

154
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,010
We're doing a feature on the 12 bronze heads.

155
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,380
You are an expert on them.

156
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,390
So we're here to learn from you.

157
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,010
The pyramids of Egypt,

158
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,350
the Parthenon of Greece,

159
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,140
and Cambodia's Angkor Wat,

160
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,760
are just like China's Old Summer Palace,

161
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,850
where numerous treasures and relics

162
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,940
were pillaged, destroyed, and stolen.

163
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,020
How are you, sir? Good day, all.

164
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,310
These students are from all over the world.

165
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,930
<i>They've been working here for years,</i>

166
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,850
<i>repatriating relics to their own countries.</i>

167
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,560
<i>We need everyone to work hard.</i>

168
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,850
<i>It takes centuries to create a miracle,</i>

169
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,350
<i>but a bomb or fire can destroy it in an instant.</i>

170
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,840
<i>After much detailed research,</i>

171
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,020
we came up with almost exact replicas.

172
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,050
You are the first reporter to see them.

173
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,090
No pictures!

174
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,380
Sorry.

175
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,880
Five of them have been auctioned.

176
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,380
What about the rest?

177
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,720
There are rumors of their whereabouts.

178
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,720
One of my students in Paris,

179
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,470
she's an expert in antiquity,

180
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,470
has recently examined two auctioned heads.

181
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,970
Which two?

182
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,470
Rabbit-head,

183
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,180
and this Rat-head.

184
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,310
Can I get in touch with her?

185
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,640
I'll contact her for you now.

186
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,230
Thanks.

187
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,560
Can I touch them?

188
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,800
Certainly.

189
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,390
Thanks.

190
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,050
No need to be so serious!

191
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,800
I must, I must

192
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,840
It's coming.

193
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,720
The Rat-head is finished.

194
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,970
Is it very valuable?

195
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,840
Depends on what you think is valuable.

196
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,140
For 1O euros, you can have them both.

197
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,310
This is your document.

198
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,520
Welcome to Paris!

199
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,980
Thank you.

200
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,560
We are here for peace.

201
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,890
Peace! Peace in your heart!

202
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,010
Peace!

203
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,350
Everybody! Okay?

204
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,510
We will voice our concerns peacefully.

205
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,260
You sure it is here?

206
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,850
According to the GPS

207
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,600
Then wait here.

208
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,930
Paris!

209
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,300
What?

210
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,770
Are you kidding?

211
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:01,800
It's your size! It's not your size!

212
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,930
If it's not,
it was the seller who made a mistake.

213
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,600
Get lost!

214
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,840
It's over between us!

215
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,560
No! It's not over! I love you, Coco!

216
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,390
I love you.

217
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,600
Love

218
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,010
Love my ass!

219
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:15,980
Okay! Okay!

220
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,970
If that's how it is, give me back my keys!

221
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,600
Who are you?

222
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,230
Who are you?

223
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,340
Professor Guan sent me.

224
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,560
Just wait!

225
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,550
Who's this fellow? Your new boyfriend?

226
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,640
Yes!

227
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,680
Thank you for catching.

228
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,140
You're welcome. You don't have keys?

229
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,480
She says it's over between us.
I just want my set of keys back

230
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,340
so I can give it to another girlfriend.

231
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,220
Sorry. I missed

232
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,930
You missed...

233
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,060
Let's go. Hurry up.

234
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,810
You are Shangguan Ma-ding?

235
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,550
Yes.

236
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,970
But my research told me...

237
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,640
Shangguan Ma-ding has passed away.

238
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,260
That was my cousin. I am Martin Shangguan.

239
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,380
Oh, really?

240
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,720
Follow me, then.

241
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,350
Boys and girls,

242
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,140
Martin is from National Geographic Channel.

243
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:12,220
He is here to do a feature on the bronze heads.

244
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,800
We need all the help we can get

245
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,890
from mainstream media like
National Geographic Channel.

246
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,560
I'll do my best.

247
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,180
A common goal among us young people

248
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,800
is to retrieve lost relics
for various countries.

249
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,640
Of course, they include the 12 bronze heads.

250
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,930
These are the two in France?

251
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,680
Yes.

252
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,770
They belong to Count Marceau.

253
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:34,980
I examined them.

254
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,680
Professor Guan verified their data.

255
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,770
They're authentic.

256
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,130
He lives in that chateau?

257
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,510
Sorry!

258
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,470
Occupational habit.

259
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,180
Guys!

260
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,050
Over here.

261
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,550
What's going on?

262
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:47,850
What's wrong, guys'?

263
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,180
I was walking with Wu Qing,
we were keeping surveillance on a cargo

264
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,220
No battery no memory card.

265
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,560
Which we suspect of being stolen antiques.

266
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,300
Suddenly,
all these guys started beating us up!

267
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,680
They only stopped
when I tried to call the police.

268
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,720
It's too risky.

269
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,510
I've told you many times,
we only protest in peace.

270
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,550
Why didn't you stop him?

271
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,850
No, listen...

272
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,510
No, guys. Listen to me.

273
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,310
I'd like to remind all of you about
the principles of our organization.

274
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,770
One, we don't give the police any trouble.

275
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,430
Two, we don't interfere
in the lives of the people.

276
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,880
And three, we don't disturb social order.

277
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,310
Absolutely!

278
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,470
You have my support.

279
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,680
Producer from National Geographic Channel.

280
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:23,720
Reporter?  / Yes.

281
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:24,760
Chinese?  / Yes.

282
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,260
You must help us to expose MP's crime,

283
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,430
make them look bad!

284
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,890
No. As media, we can only report the facts.

285
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,850
We cannot exaggerate and make things up.

286
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,010
I have taken photos.

287
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,630
You sit down!

288
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,980
Be careful.

289
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,010
I'm sorry this happened on your first visit.

290
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,430
We've got nothing else for you, goodbye.

291
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,230
Can I have a word with you?

292
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,340
Sure.

293
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,510
Over here

294
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,480
What's the matter?

295
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,140
These people, these big corporations

296
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,480
You and your students must...

297
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,560
Okay, thanks, stay in touch!

298
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,640
What on earth?

299
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,970
He'll crack their code.

300
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,390
Sure.

301
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,100
When the time comes, I might be there.

302
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,720
You're responsible for my getaway.

303
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,890
The Chateau's landscape is flat.

304
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,310
There is only one low-lying area.

305
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,300
You meet me at the low-lying area.

306
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,730
Follow me.

307
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,840
Monsieur Pierre, during our phone conversation,

308
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,590
you said you wanted more information
about our bronze heads.

309
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,220
We've brought you this portfolio.

310
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,470
I'm sure you'll find everything inside.

311
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,670
Madam, I beg you to pick up the phone!

312
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,930
Are you sure of their authenticity?

313
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,390
Yes, of course.

314
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,810
Indeed, there are many replicas
on the market now.

315
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,520
Even experienced collectors have been fooled.

316
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,760
If you have doubts, you're free to test them.

317
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,060
Okay, let me keep the book.

318
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,020
I will contact you soon.

319
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,560
Call me back.

320
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,220
He used his hands to flip through the album.

321
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,680
I think he's heading to the vault.

322
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,350
Their surveillance systems
are installed outside,

323
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,310
for fear of damaging the relics.

324
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,550
It seems that we are spot on,

325
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,930
the owner is obsessed with tidiness!

326
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,520
Just like you: a mysophobic!

327
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,010
Now we can only wait.

328
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,600
Let's wait, then.

329
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,060
They're all seeing their boss off.

330
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,430
I am watching.

331
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,680
Tell me when you are ready.

332
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,480
We are ready!

333
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,180
In five seconds

334
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,010
I can see the fingerprints.

335
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:41,600
Hurry up.

336
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,340
They're coming back.

337
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,560
Found it! It's behind the bookshelf.

338
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,470
Same old trick.

339
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,010
Damn it!

340
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,880
What's wrong?

341
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,430
Three sets of combination of 46 letters each!

342
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,640
It'll take eight computers two days
to crack it.

343
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,520
Weird!

344
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,350
What has the boss been up to?

345
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,680
Why would one obsessed

346
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,100
with tidiness misplace his books?

347
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,560
Should be put..

348
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,430
Here.

349
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,640
Here.

350
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,890
That's how he reminds himself
of the combinations!

351
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,730
Marion.

352
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:36,640
Yes, sir?

353
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,060
Some coffee, please.

354
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,930
Very good, sir.

355
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,930
Let's go. / Okay.

356
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,760
I know how to open it.

357
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,050
It's opened.

358
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,340
Found the bronze heads yet?

359
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,350
Give me a minute.

360
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,640
The Rat-head,

361
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,970
the Rabbit-head.

362
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,810
Do they look like our replicas?

363
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,970
To me...they're all the same.

364
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,550
Is there anything else worth taking?

365
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,090
They're all junk!

366
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,760
You know what I've just seen?

367
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,350
What?

368
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,890
The Pharaoh's scepter and the Czarina's staff,

369
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,310
the Golden Eagle Box,

370
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,850
and the Star of Arabia!

371
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,970
They're all lost national relics!

372
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,640
Now, they belong to us.

373
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,230
Guess what else I've found?

374
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,390
What?

375
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,510
A painting that we dreamt of stealing.

376
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,850
The Roses?

377
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,390
Bingo!

378
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,640
I've been looking all over for you,

379
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,730
Now you show up by yourself.

380
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,230
Lucky me.

381
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,970
Just look at this photo.

382
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,550
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

383
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,390
Who are you?

384
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,760
What are you doing?

385
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,980
Guards!

386
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,310
<i>Hey! Stop!</i>

387
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,600
<i>We've a situation!</i>

388
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,220
<i>He's upstairs! Go get him!</i>

389
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,810
They saw me!

390
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,480
What's going on?

391
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,390
I am still inside, being chased by dogs.

392
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,810
Give me directions!

393
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,010
There he is!

394
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,270
Look! He is on the roof!

395
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,680
Go get him!

396
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,300
Go that way.

397
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,800
Catch me if you can!

398
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,430
More of the same?

399
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,100
I'm southeast of the chateau,

400
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,720
tell me where to go!

401
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,510
There's a maze ahead of you,

402
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,980
stay out of it!

403
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,520
I think I'm already in it!

404
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,730
Can you take the high road?

405
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,010
No room for a take-off!

406
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,510
I've to give it a try.

407
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:10,680
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe...

408
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,350
I'm coming your way !

409
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,220
<i>It's no time for nursery rhymes!</i>

410
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,890
Cut the crap and find me an exit!

411
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,430
<i>We can't see you unless you're airborne!</i>

412
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,680
They stopped?

413
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,720
Maybe they are short-sighted

414
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,480
There he is! He's airborne!

415
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,600
He's gone down again!

416
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,840
The runway is too short!

417
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,810
It's a dead end!

418
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:41,760
What's that noise?

419
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,060
I am mimicking a dog!

420
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,310
Want a bite?

421
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,800
Lie down!

422
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,970
Nice!

423
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,930
Nice dog.

424
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,680
Stay put!

425
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,050
Good doggie.

426
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,800
Beat it!

427
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,970
Speaking Chinese to a French dog?

428
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,930
I'm surprised he could understand.

429
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,430
We'll call you later.

430
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,390
Okay.

431
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,140
Guards

432
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,730
<i>Go check it out right now!</i>

433
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,730
I am out, finally!

434
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,300
Call Simon and tell him to handle the rest.

435
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,970
You do it. We're not on speaking terms.

436
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,230
Martin?

437
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,840
Martin!

438
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,810
What are you doing?

439
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,020
Do I know you?

440
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,760
Was that you in the chateau?

441
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,140
Coco, it was someone else.

442
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,100
Someone else?

443
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,560
You can address me by name!

444
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,220
It was you!

445
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,760
Watch out!

446
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,260
It was you!

447
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,010
Let go me!

448
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,130
How could you steal?

449
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,850
I don't know what you're talking about.

450
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,340
We've been had! They knew each other!

451
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,470
Good Lord!

452
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,560
Go!

453
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,640
Let go of me,

454
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,600
and drive carefully!

455
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,840
Are you still in denial?

456
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,890
Okay, it was me.

457
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,560
Why did you do that?

458
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,600
This is not the time to explain.

459
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,430
Watch out!

460
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,880
You alright?

461
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,480
I'll meet you at the boat house.

462
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,470
Simon, I'm at your 6 o'clock,
9 o'clock above!

463
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,850
Perfect!

464
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,510
Where is the other head?

465
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,930
Coco's got it.

466
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,930
You're no reporter. Who are you really?

467
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,770
Me?

468
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,510
I have double identities.

469
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,390
I am president of the non-profit making

470
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,010
International Foundation of Relics...

471
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,060
Metals, Porcelain and Paintings

472
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:09,800
What?

473
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,100
I've never heard of this organization.

474
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,140
You know every one by heart?

475
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,810
What should we do with this head?

476
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,850
Return it to the Chinese government.

477
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,010
Good idea!

478
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,260
<i>Be careful, guys. Let's go!</i>

479
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,760
<i>It's here! Let's go!</i>

480
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,060
<i>Go, go! Let's go!</i>

481
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,800
Hello.

482
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,810
Oh, no. Not this.

483
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,890
Hello, is this the police?

484
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,840
What's going on?

485
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,260
Don't come out!

486
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,770
My power cable!

487
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,890
Police! Don't move!

488
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,760
Police! Police! Don't move!

489
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,340
I swear that they are accomplices!

490
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,680
It's not true!

491
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,350
The Marceau family's reputation is impeccable.

492
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,590
Impeccable reputation?

493
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,390
We've watched these tapes,

494
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,730
and we saw nothing.

495
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,180
There are customs documents,

496
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:51,510
and a witness who saw nothing at the chateau.

497
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:54,470
She was estranged
after her uncle rejected a loan request.

498
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,390
No, I was three when I last visited him.

499
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,760
Do you really think I'd remember?

500
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,890
I swear to God that.. / Shut up!

501
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,770
We will keep the statue for two weeks.

502
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,430
If no one claims it,

503
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,800
you can have it back.

504
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,390
If they bother you again,

505
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,680
let us know.

506
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,720
Now, you are free to go.

507
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,430
Thank you.

508
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,430
But that's not true!  / Shut up!

509
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,520
I swear they stole the heads!

510
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,680
You've other things to worry about!

511
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,020
How did it go?

512
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,850
Everything went as expected.

513
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,060
I still want to thank

514
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,220
this honest and beautiful citizen of France.

515
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,590
You're welcome. All I did was tell the truth.

516
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,260
My name is Catherine.

517
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:33,760
You seem interested in those bronze heads.

518
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:37,180
I have something at my house
you might be interested in.

519
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,680
Well, think about it.

520
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,930
Drive on, Bruno.

521
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,220
Chateau Sichel.

522
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,720
We've always wanted to visit this chateau.

523
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,390
Welcome! I'm sorry.

524
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,560
There are some routine security measures here.

525
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,100
The bank has taken possession of everything.

526
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,560
Nothing of value is permitted to be taken out.

527
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:54,640
It's okay.

528
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:55,680
Beautiful castle!

529
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,270
Please, follow me.

530
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,890
Follow them.

531
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:08,930
Our family went bankrupt
in the financial crisis.

532
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,680
Still nice to be able to live here.

533
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,140
Thank you.

534
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,180
Your ancestors may have been

535
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:19,470
the last people to see these beautiful creatures.

536
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,760
Yes, I know what you mean.

537
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:25,560
Thing are only treasured
after they've disappeared.

538
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,090
Yeah, you are right!

539
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,220
Rooster?

540
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,260
It's the reason I invited you here.

541
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,760
Is that real?

542
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,930
It's been here since I was born.

543
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,140
This is stolen property, right?

544
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,630
What did she say?

545
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,930
She said beautiful staircase.

546
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,470
Thank you.

547
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,560
Let's go.

548
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,640
This is my great-great-grandfather,

549
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,180
her grandfather.

550
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,770
Years ago he came back from overseas.

551
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,430
He always wanted to set sail again
to find his second command

552
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,270
but never had the funds to do so.

553
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:08,310
Later his son, my grandma's father,

554
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,680
put together an expedition

555
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,470
and went to sea in search of the Indestructible.

556
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,680
But he never returned.

557
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,850
He just disappeared mysteriously.

558
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,440
I heard you have the animals' heads.

559
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,600
Maybe you would have clues
about my great-grandfather?

560
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,180
I don't give a damn!

561
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,270
Bronze heads, scepter, diamond

562
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,140
they can never be made public.

563
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,310
The one I really want back is the painting.

564
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,850
The value of what they've stolen
is over a billion dollars!

565
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,100
If you'd installed an infrared security system,
things would have been

566
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,140
So it's my fault, then?

567
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,180
No, no, no...

568
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,520
I'll make you a promise.

569
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,680
If you don't recover that painting,

570
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,680
I will strangle you myself!

571
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,600
It's a rocking horse I had when I was a child.

572
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,470
My great-great grandfather painted this
after his return.

573
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,800
It's the view he saw after his ship was damaged.

574
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,640
Why don't you have a look around?
I'll go get some tea.

575
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,930
Thank you.

576
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,760
Over there.

577
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,680
Sorry, we need to talk in private.

578
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:23,720
How can we steal the Rooster-head?

579
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,770
Best is to stay here for 2 days, steal and go.

580
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:27,510
<i>Not possible.</i>

581
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,260
<i>At least replace it with a replica.</i>

582
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,630
<i>But we need data to produce a replica.</i>

583
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,130
Professor Guan has them.

584
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,480
Talk to Coco.

585
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,760
Never mention steal in front of her,

586
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,180
otherwise she won't help.

587
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,520
What should we do?

588
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,050
Guys, look!

589
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,930
Castiglione's Emperor Qianlong's Autumn Hunt!

590
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:45,720
Is it valuable?

591
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:46,760
All antiquities are valuable.

592
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,510
My granny's chamber pot must be priceless, too!

593
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,010
So this painting does exist!

594
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,850
I thought it was destroyed in a fire.

595
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:53,890
In 1860,

596
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:57,720
my great-great grandfather sailed to China

597
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:00,970
on Indestructible and won a great victory.

598
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,840
This was one of the spoils of war
he brought back.

599
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:08,300
You must mean
the ransacking of Old Summer Palace.

600
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,510
That was during the Second Opium War, remember?

601
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,390
That depends on your point of view.

602
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,470
Yes, she is right.

603
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,890
The killing of British and French diplomats

604
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,560
by the corrupt Qing Dynasty
was an excuse to start the war.

605
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:26,560
Is that a legitimate reason for two industrialized
nations to invade country?

606
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,390
In the eyes of those industrialized nations,

607
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,260
China was a superpower.

608
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:34,090
True, we even called ourselves Celestial Kingdom

609
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,430
Whose side are you on?

610
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,560
Yours, of course.

611
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,680
Then?

612
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,100
Sorry?

613
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,680
What's next?

614
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,140
On the way back, they met a storm,

615
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,810
and the ship was damaged.

616
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,390
I bet it was overladen with loot.

617
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,180
Served them right.

618
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,020
What did she say?

619
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,930
Could you speak in English?

620
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,020
I don't speak English.

621
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,640
She said that's unfortunate

622
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,980
I didn't say it was unfortunate.

623
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,970
I said it served him right!

624
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,590
Served him right?

625
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,760
What a cruel thing to say!

626
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,060
He went to China on orders of his country.

627
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,720
It was his duty as a soldier.

628
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:15,220
Fortunately, he was picked up
by a passing Chinese ship.

629
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,970
The God of Justice must be blind!

630
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,260
What did you say?

631
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,640
She said thank goodness he came back.

632
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,390
That's obviously not what she said.

633
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,140
But, thank you all the same.

634
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,480
You're welcome.

635
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:30,560
What are you doing?

636
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,640
I'm taking it back to China!

637
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,760
This is my home,

638
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,730
you can't just take anything you want!

639
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,760
Just like over a hundred years ago,

640
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:41,140
your ancestors didn't ask for permission
before taking this

641
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:42,720
Coco

642
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,220
Coco

643
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,340
These things happened so long ago.

644
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,390
Back then, if a woman wore too little clothes,

645
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,730
someone might throw a stone at you,

646
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:58,140
no, at her.

647
00:39:58,690 --> 00:39:59,930
Oh, sorry.

648
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,140
Sorry for what?

649
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,560
Don't be a bleeding heart.

650
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,640
She should be the one apologizing.

651
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,060
What did she say?

652
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,720
Did she say something?

653
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,140
I don't need you to translate.

654
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,390
Did you all forget?

655
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,730
They came to our country a century ago,

656
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,720
burned, raped, murdered and pillaged.

657
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,440
Over a century ago,

658
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,470
you came to our country to rape,

659
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,640
pillage and murder.

660
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,100
Even a hundred years later,

661
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:30,220
these memories still hurt the Chinese!

662
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,480
It's true.

663
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,890
I studied history. Whatever the excuses

664
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,430
I studied history.

665
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,800
Whatever the excuses used,

666
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,180
these things did indeed happen.

667
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:50,310
Sometimes we can only explain
such things with invalid reasons, such as

668
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:54,050
That was an era in which might makes right.

669
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,180
We cannot use today's civilized standards

670
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:58,350
to judge the mistakes of the past.

671
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,940
Even now, it's the strong who comes up on top.

672
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,380
You must have power
before others will reason with you.

673
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,140
Never mind. I'm beginning
to understand her point of view.

674
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,010
Sorry.

675
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,690
Anyway, all of this now belongs to the bank.

676
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,100
They're worthless to me.

677
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,970
I'd give them to you if I could.

678
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,010
Didn't you want to visit this castle?

679
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,230
Now that we are here,

680
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,930
let's stay for a couple of days.

681
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,600
Come on, have some tea.

682
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,930
Since you're so fond of each other,

683
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,640
have fun yourselves!

684
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,810
She is going to the bathroom.

685
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,470
What is it?

686
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,760
Come take a look.

687
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,890
Catherine!  / Yes?

688
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,560
Your great grandfather, the ship...

689
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,770
did it sink, or was it grounded?

690
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,480
Who knows?

691
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,770
You know what? We're interested

692
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,680
about recovering your great grandfather.

693
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,600
If we stay another couple of days,

694
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,810
start an investigation, more information,

695
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,720
we might be able to help.

696
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,310
Thank you so much! It's wonderful.

697
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,600
We have plenty of rooms here.

698
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,010
You can stay as long as you wish.

699
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,180
I'm going to make the preparation.

700
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,850
But he may not be alive.

701
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,340
It's okay.

702
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,550
Coco.

703
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,510
Thank you. I will call you later.

704
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,760
Thanks for your help.

705
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:22,010
Thank you.

706
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,230
Let's stay and steal the Rooster-head.

707
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,390
No stealing!

708
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,480
As guests here, we mustn't steal.

709
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,390
Who says we can't?

710
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,100
They stole from us.

711
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:34,520
We're just retrieving, not stealing.

712
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,300
Good point!

713
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,270
We need a replica to do the switch.

714
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,730
But we don't have data to make one.

715
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,060
Professor Guan has them.

716
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:42,890
I'll ask him.

717
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,260
Great! Hurry up!

718
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:03,390
<i>Here!</i>

719
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,510
<i>Data?</i>

720
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:11,600
<i>Hello.</i>

721
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,430
<i>Wee wee This way, Madam.</i>

722
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,770
<i>Thank you!</i>

723
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:40,100
<i>Thank you!</i>

724
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,060
<i>Bye!</i>

725
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:50,270
<i>Genius!</i>

726
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,930
<i>What are these fools doing here?</i>

727
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,180
<i>Launch picnic?</i>

728
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,300
<i>They're now our lunch!</i>

729
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,200
<i>Mom and dad, when can we go on holiday?</i>

730
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:52,050
Look!

731
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:54,890
<i>This is the data captured by our mini-plane.</i>

732
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,310
How is it?

733
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,020
No wonder it's not on the map!

734
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:25,220
Bingo!

735
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:27,090
He was here when he drew this.

736
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,720
You guys are amazing!

737
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:30,260
No, technology is.

738
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:31,930
What shall we do next?

739
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,430
We'll camp here.

740
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,230
Voice mail? Oh, forget it

741
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:37,850
Martin.

742
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,840
News said three heads were auctioned.

743
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:41,470
Impossible!

744
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,640
Why not? I'll show you.

745
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:44,930
No signal.

746
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,100
They must be fakes!

747
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:48,810
We've got the real ones. Right?

748
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,180
If fakes could fetch a fortune,

749
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:52,600
how much will the real ones worth?

750
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:54,180
They must be priceless!

751
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,470
And now a word of advice.

752
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,510
Don't change with the lights on.

753
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,480
Why not?

754
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,720
Look.

755
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:00,590
Just now I was

756
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:02,060
I didn't see anything.

757
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,930
Honest!

758
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:06,140
We saw nothing.

759
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:07,760
Don't turn on the satellite receiver.

760
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,140
What? Lizard!

761
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,340
It's just a lizard.

762
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,430
Where are you going?

763
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,300
I'm going up.

764
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,890
But JC

765
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,680
But JC told us not to move.

766
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:23,720
Do as you like.

767
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:24,840
Wait for me!

768
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:25,390
How long?

769
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,600
NOW!

770
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:28,340
Look at you.

771
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,340
What? It's just my make-up bag!

772
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,840
Whatever.

773
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,560
What's wrong with you two?

774
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:37,600
Still in a stand-off.

775
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:41,140
If it is not for my child,
I'd have left him long ago.

776
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:42,180
What about you?

777
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:43,680
She is still not answering my call.

778
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:46,050
I was only three days late for her birthday.

779
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:47,850
Why so mad about it?

780
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,430
Where are you going?

781
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,850
This way.

782
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,010
How do you know?

783
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,760
Instinct!

784
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,680
Whatever.

785
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:57,390
Oh my god!

786
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,350
The trees on this island,

787
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,390
must be kept secret from those lumberjacks.

788
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,630
If not, none will be spared.

789
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:04,180
Now you're very happy.

790
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:05,640
Know how hard I've been trying?

791
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:08,600
Have you considered other options?

792
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,720
No one could tolerate her tantrum!

793
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,260
See who leaves first.

794
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,550
What's with Valentine's Day and the rest?

795
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:16,390
Where did they come from?

796
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,350
Does it matter whose idea they were?

797
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,310
It's important

798
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,970
you're there when she needs you.

799
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,720
Then who brings home the bread?

800
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:24,590
You men just don't understand women!

801
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,680
Over there!

802
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:30,560
It's Coco!

803
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,600
<i>I told them not to run around.</i>

804
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,090
<i>Catherine!</i>

805
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:35,810
<i>Coming! We're coming!</i>

806
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,390
<i>Help us!</i>

807
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,350
<i>Hold on!</i>

808
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,720
Look at yourself! Help me!

809
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,930
Didn't I tell you to stay put?

810
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:45,760
Hold on!

811
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:02,350
Trouble!

812
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:04,890
What happened?

813
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,380
They fell down a chasm!

814
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,640
I told you to stay put!

815
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:11,380
It's her fault!

816
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,980
Say something I understand in English!

817
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,680
Purple

818
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,970
Panty!

819
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:22,600
Hold tight!

820
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:31,340
Purple is my favorite color!

821
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,470
You came dressed for a picnic?

822
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,060
Don't tell me how to dress!

823
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:36,100
What happened to your instinct?

824
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:39,020
Girls, we haven't landed yet!

825
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:42,100
JC, where's your hand?

826
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,180
Under your purple.

827
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:45,890
Let go!

828
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,310
You'll fall!

829
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,640
Let go! I can hold on myself.

830
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:49,680
You sure?

831
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:51,180
I'm sure!

832
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:52,470
Okay.

833
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,970
Madam, you've landed.

834
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:17,680
We're fine.

835
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:19,350
But Coco is missing!

836
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,220
JC is okay, but we've lost Coco.

837
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,760
Give us the coordinates.

838
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:29,930
This way.  / Okay.

839
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,270
Coco!

840
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:44,720
Coco!

841
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:46,930
I am over here...

842
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,680
I found Coco!

843
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:50,770
Ask captain to bring the first aid kit.

844
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:52,350
Understood!

845
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,510
Are you alright?

846
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,430
My foot...

847
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,680
Which foot?

848
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:00,130
Don't move!

849
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,590
What happened? / It's nothing.

850
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:10,090
Your foot!

851
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,100
Nothing, nothing.

852
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,430
Snake!

853
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,630
Where?

854
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:23,630
Done!

855
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:24,930
My foot...

856
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,270
You dislocated your ankle. It's okay now.

857
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,350
Over here.

858
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:35,010
Simon.

859
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,680
Look at these trees!

860
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:39,260
Hacked by men.

861
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,010
<i>I just saw cannons and cannonballs!</i>

862
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,520
<i>This vessel looks like it's from that era!</i>

863
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:52,020
<i>Could this be the Indestructible
we've been looking for?</i>

864
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:53,890
<i>Very likely.</i>

865
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:56,810
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

866
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,390
<i>This chain rode...</i>

867
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,100
<i>What is it doing here?</i>

868
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:04,220
<i>It goes all the way into that tree!</i>

869
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,390
<i>The Indestructible!</i>

870
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,430
You've found it!

871
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,680
No, we fell on it.

872
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:13,180
How lucky.

873
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:15,800
No way!

874
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,430
It's for real!

875
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,930
It's okay.

876
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,720
<i>Just a tarantula.</i>

877
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:35,380
JC, I found my great grandfather!

878
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,680
What?

879
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:38,600
You can tell from the bones?

880
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:39,720
No, no. This ring.

881
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:42,390
It has my family crest. I found it here.

882
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,130
There are two!

883
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:45,050
Which one?

884
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:46,270
Instinct!

885
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:47,810
Quick. /  This one!

886
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,350
Good!

887
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,220
Are you sure?

888
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:51,090
Sure.

889
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:53,090
<i>I'll stuff your great grandfather
in my backpack.</i>

890
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:53,890
<i>His arm.</i>

891
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,010
<i>Oops Sorry!</i>

892
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:18,760
JC

893
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:21,770
We've found the Indestructible!

894
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:27,890
<i>Who could've imagined, at a place like this!</i>

895
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,230
<i>How did you find it?</i>

896
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:30,180
<i>Brilliant!</i>

897
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:31,800
<i>We stumbled upon it.</i>

898
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,390
<i>Almost broke our legs.</i>

899
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:35,090
Found the bronze heads yet?

900
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:36,430
We found one.

901
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,220
Bonnie, I have the medical kit!

902
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:44,760
<i>Go around! There is an old path!</i>

903
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:46,230
<i>Just follow the marks we left!</i>

904
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:47,890
Okay, I'm on my way!

905
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,310
Thank you!

906
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,270
This is the Indestructible?

907
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:51,930
Yes.

908
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,930
How did it end up here?

909
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:54,680
typhoon?

910
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:56,140
Typhoon that powerful?

911
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:56,850
Tsunami?

912
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:57,810
Everything was possible.

913
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,220
On our way here,

914
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:01,140
we saw graves and skeletons.

915
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:05,140
Those outside the cave
must belong to the crew.

916
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:07,850
Judging on the decomposition of those inside,

917
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,220
they're different from the others.

918
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:12,680
Some were stabbed, too.

919
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:14,890
They must have fought before they died.

920
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,730
Probably men brought by her great grandfather.

921
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:20,220
They didn't die from natural causes.

922
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:23,060
They killed each another.

923
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:26,930
Didn't her great-great grandfather return home?

924
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,770
Then what was his son looking for?

925
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,760
Whatever the reason,
it doesn't matter anymore.

926
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:34,800
You are right.

927
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:38,100
It happened 150 years ago. Right?

928
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,880
She understands Chinese?

929
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,810
I told her the same thing just now.

930
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,180
They killed each other?

931
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:45,520
So his son came back to look for

932
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,600
the spoils his father left behind?

933
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:48,760
Right?

934
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,130
Right? / Right.

935
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,180
We need to take a leak!

936
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:53,600
Right.

937
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,470
Where are you going?

938
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,310
Bathroom!

939
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:56,850
All of you?

940
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,560
Yeah! Wee wee

941
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:02,270
My grandmother's going to be very happy.

942
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:03,630
How is your foot?

943
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,850
It goes downhill,

944
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:11,010
with logs lined up all the way.

945
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:12,980
No wonder so many trees had fallen.

946
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:15,060
Don't do that!

947
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:16,600
There is more.

948
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:18,060
<i>Look over there!</i>

949
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:19,550
<i>An enormous anchor!</i>

950
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,760
<i>But why is it being hung on a tree?</i>

951
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:25,730
It's a very clever lever device.

952
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,890
<i>When the anchor descends,</i>

953
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,260
the chain rode will ascend,

954
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:34,310
and sends the trunk downhill via the pulley.

955
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:38,220
No wonder there isn't a single pulley
on the ship!

956
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:42,220
How we benefit from our ancestors' wisdom!

957
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,890
You don't seem excited.

958
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:45,680
I am wrecking my brain

959
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:47,970
on how to take this trunk back with us?

960
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,720
If this trunk...

961
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:52,970
There are no ifs.

962
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,640
Money! Money! Money!

963
00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:59,890
JC, the medical kit

964
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,810
and your friend is here.

965
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:03,430
Hey. JC!

966
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,100
I'm very happy to see you again.

967
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:10,510
My friend, it's a big surprise.

968
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,230
Pierre?

969
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,880
Catherine!

970
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,890
Address me as miss! You're ridiculous!

971
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:21,760
Shut up!

972
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:23,510
You're not in your castle anymore.

973
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,930
I knew you were working together.

974
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,680
I've been following you
since you met Catherine.

975
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:32,720
Give me the painting
and the other things you stole.

976
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:35,310
You think I'd bring everything
to this island?

977
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,680
It's a great place!

978
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:41,520
There's no one else. Just us!

979
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:45,090
I could kill you now, and nobody would know.

980
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,470
Ready!

981
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,970
Pierre!

982
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,510
Are you alright?

983
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,390
Idiots! These guns are not loaded!

984
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,260
It wasn't us! We didn't do anything!

985
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:01,230
It's okay! No bullets!

986
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:02,390
So who fired?

987
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,100
You guys are impossible. / Don't move!

988
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,140
Or I'll blow your heads off

989
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,180
Pirates?

990
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:09,470
Yep! Bingo!

991
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,390
<i>If you don't do what I say,</i>

992
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,810
<i>I'll kill you all!</i>

993
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:18,600
If we work together, we can beat them.

994
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:25,060
We've been here for a long time.

995
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:28,260
Only now do we know this place.

996
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:31,140
Welcome to my island, my friends!

997
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:32,930
We're reasonable men.

998
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,220
All we want is your money.

999
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,520
Squat! Hurry up! Understand?

1000
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,930
Don't do anything stupid and no one

1001
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,100
gets hurt!

1002
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:47,220
<i>The ransom is $500,000 each.</i>

1003
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:49,810
<i>Do what you need to do.</i>

1004
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,270
<i>Bravo!</i>

1005
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:53,230
<i>Or we can feed you to the sharks!</i>

1006
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:54,680
<i>Bravo!</i>

1007
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:57,600
<i>I don't mind keeping the women, though.</i>

1008
00:56:57,730 --> 00:56:59,590
<i>Bravo!</i>

1009
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:01,060
Let me tell you something.

1010
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:03,050
We are not with them.

1011
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:06,050
My boss would be happy to get you
any money you want.

1012
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:07,270
He's very rich.

1013
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:10,100
Those guys want to fight you but I said no!

1014
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:13,510
Take them away!

1015
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,010
Thank you!

1016
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,640
So what are you doing on my island?

1017
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:20,680
It's my hat!

1018
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,930
Tell me. What are you doing here?

1019
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,100
Don't understand.

1020
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:27,390
Mandarin?

1021
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:31,890
Boss asked what were you doing here?

1022
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:36,260
Barbecue.

1023
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:38,230
What did you say?

1024
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:40,140
This is a metal detector.

1025
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,510
Barbecue? With this?

1026
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,260
What were you doing with this?

1027
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:45,980
Mini microwave.

1028
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:49,800
Do you think I'm stupid?!

1029
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,520
This is a metal detector.

1030
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,100
What are you looking for?

1031
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:58,510
You don't want to tell me?

1032
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,430
I'll find out.

1033
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,600
Take the girls.

1034
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:02,810
Hands off!

1035
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,720
Lie down!

1036
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,130
What the

1037
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:31,230
I didn't pull the trigger!

1038
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:32,310
Take care of those at one o'clock!

1039
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,430
Okay!

1040
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:39,510
Boss! Are you okay?

1041
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:42,050
Don't move!

1042
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,470
I forget to tell you. No bullets.

1043
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,590
If we stay calm, nothing will happen to us.

1044
00:58:58,730 --> 00:58:59,340
Yes!

1045
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,600
Stop him from getting the gun!

Twelve o'clock

1051
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,180
What should we do now, boss?

1052
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:42,390
Let's get out of here!

1053
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,010
Mother of Mercy, I'm scared!

1054
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:03,010
Snake-head?

1055

You go with them first!

1087

Meet you by the trunk! / OK!

1089

Don't move!

1094
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:23,010

I've only lived once!

1103
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:11,890
Are they all dead?

I'm done with being reasonable!

1109

Hold this!

1118

A bone

Coco! Are you okay?

01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:09,090
Gold!

1126
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:10,060
How do you know about the gold?

1127
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:10,890
It fell out.

1128
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:12,510
You knew about the gold in this trunk?

1129
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,730
I didn't say trunk!

1130
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:15,390
Let me see. It's from my boot.

1131
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,100
Is there gold in this trunk?

Say something in English! /

It's changed!

1135
01:05:23,730 --> 01:05:24,720
Where is the Snake-head?

1136
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,100
The Dragon-head must be in there!

1137
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,680
You go!

1138
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:32,470

Captain! Go southeast!

1149
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:57,810
The road ends here.

1150
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,090
This way!

1151
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,100
It's almost done.

It's stuck!

1155
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,050
What is going on?

1156
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:19,300
No time to explain!

1157

Here they come!

1158
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:38,550

Fire in the hole!

1170

We still have five.

1179
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:33,100
The bees are not so friendly.

01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:36,840
It's okay!

1192
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:38,640
It's okay. He loved the sea.

1193
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:45,680
Here! Here

1194
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:57,050
Hey guys! Here!

1195
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:01,180
<i>The trunk is 1.3m in diameter and 7m long.</i>

1196
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:03,770
<i>Its cylindrical volume is
about 9.28 million cubic centimeters.</i>

1197
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:05,060
<i>Based on its relative weight,</i>

1198
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:07,470
<i>and the fact that it still floats,
about 1/22 should be gold.</i>

1199
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,970
<i>Divide that by the size of each gold bar,</i>

1200
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:09,590
<i>inside this trunk... My butt hurts!</i>

1201
01:10:09,730 --> 01:10:11,140
<i>There are 2,900 pieces of gold.</i>

1202
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:13,310
<i>Multiply that by the density of gold,</i>

1203
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,470
There are eight tons!

1204
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:16,770
So much?

1205
01:10:16,890 --> 01:10:17,630
A ton of gold each!

1206
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:18,850
What about the two excess tons?

1207
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:20,340
Divide them into eight parts.

1208
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,560
What about the two excess parts?

1209
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:22,520
They are yours.

1210
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,180
Why him?

1211
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:24,270
I just feel like it.

1212
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:26,640
This is why they
slaughtered one another.

1213
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:28,600
No way, we don't even quarrel!

1214
01:10:28,730 --> 01:10:29,680
What's the result?

1215
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:31,180
Eight tons! Maybe more!

1216
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,890
Let's celebrate! Let's go outside!

1217
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:36,600
One word for this journey: romantic!

1218
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:37,890
Thrilling!

1219
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,350
Rewarding!

1220
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:41,350
Intriguing!

1221
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,970
Satisfying!

1222
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,390
<i>Leave your message after the tone.</i>

1223
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,930
I know you are there.

1224
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:18,350
Stop sulking on your own.

1225
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,560
Pick up the phone and bawl me out.

1226
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:22,300
Got to go.

1227
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,720
Can't you ever have a proper conversation?

1228
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:26,970
We start off nice and calm every time,

1229
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:28,720
but always end up having a row.

1230
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:30,010
Morning!  / Morning!

1231
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:31,510
Thanks for your help last night!

1232
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:32,550
Don't mention it.

1233
01:11:32,690 --> 01:11:34,390
Your medicine

1234
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:37,100
Don't you guys have a confession to make?

1235
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:38,010
Like what?

1236
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:39,560
Good morning, everybody!

1237
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:40,850
Stay here!

1238
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:43,940
Last night I wrote a poem to thank all of you

1239
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:45,550
for what you've done for me.

1240
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:46,770
Coco, can you translate?

1241
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:48,060
Okay.

1242
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:51,770
The oppressed rescued by brave knights

1243
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:54,730
A bunch of lying scoundrels in real life

1244
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:56,270
What?

1245
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:59,720
They set sail for a hazardous journey

1246
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:01,310
Driven by greed

1247
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,640
they embarked on a stealthy voyage

1248
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:06,810
with hearts pure, righteous, fearless

1249
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:08,850
and without self interest.

1250
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:10,970
Heaven will be your judge.

1251
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:14,550
Stealing national treasure is despicable.

1252
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:18,730
Their generosity will be rewarded.

1253
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:20,510
You may evade the judgment of law,

1254
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,560
but never escape your own conscience.

1255
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:23,680
God bless you.

1256
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:25,390
Ask yourselves every new year's eve,

1257
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,510
did I steal next year's zodiac animal head?

1258
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,560
Even all the riches in the world,

1259
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:31,850
won't buy you any peace of mind.

1260
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,340
Wow! Chinese is so long!

1261
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,810
That was God bless you?

1262
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:36,930
Yes.

1263
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:39,270
Are you sure the translation was correct?

1264
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:40,930
Was I right?

1265
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,730
We like it.

1266
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:44,260
I like it.

1267
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:45,880
We like it.

1268
01:12:46,690 --> 01:12:48,140
What are you trying to say?

1269
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:49,890
You always meant to look for gold.

1270
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:52,060
You even brought metal detectors.

1271
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,890
Gold or bronze, we need metal detectors.

1272
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:55,980
Liars!

1273
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:00,180
You're gunning for these gold from day one!

1274
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,590
How could you rummage through my room?

1275
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:05,560
Stop being a jerk.

1276
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:08,800
I saw these
when I helped you back to your cabin.

1277
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:10,270
Oh, dolphins!

1278
01:13:11,190 --> 01:13:12,350
Whales, too!

1279
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,930
Crocodiles!

1280
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:15,680
Crocodiles in open sea?  / Let's go.

1281
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:17,480
They swim, don't they?

1282
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,430
You really work well as a team!

1283
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:23,970
Okay, then. Fire away

1284
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,760
You're not even Martin Shangguan.

1285
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:28,140
Correct.

1286
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:30,060
You weren't looking
for Catherine's great grandfather.

1287
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:32,390
You came for the gold and the bronze heads!

1288
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,060
You could say that.

1289
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:37,300
You'll auction off each recovered bronze head.

1290
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,180
Right.

1291
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:40,470
What do you plan to do with these?

1292
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:42,890
Someone will pick them up
when we reach port.

1293
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:45,230
I thought they're for the Chinese people!

1294
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:47,010
You're just a mercenary!

1295
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:48,600
There are relics all over the world.

1296
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:50,590
Why can't we profit a little from them?

1297
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:51,890
You feel no shame?

1298
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:53,810
It's a matter of national dignity!

1299
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:55,050
These battered heads...

1300
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:56,680
have nothing to do with dignity

1301
01:13:56,810 --> 01:13:59,220
They represent centuries of
our cultural heritage!

1302
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:00,890
What's the big deal?

1303
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:02,480
China is thousands of years old.

1304
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,720
What we could achieve then,
we can do better now.

1305
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:06,140
What's going on?

1306
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:08,350
Boy-girl problem. Come on.

1307
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,590
If you like,
I can get someone to make you a dozen.

1308
01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:12,340
From every dynasty

1309
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,760
Scoundrel!

1310
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:15,010
What, me?

1311
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:17,310
From your first day with Professor Guan,

1312
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,770
you have been using us!

1313
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:19,630
Young lady

1314
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:21,560
don't pretend you're holier than me.

1315
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,470
We didn't ask you to come along.

1316
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:24,390
And

1317
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,140
if a fish doesn't open its mouth,
it can't take a bite!

1318
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:27,350
It's take the bait!

1319
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:32,680
Being a cheat is nothing to be proud of.

1320
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:34,930
Your victims are those who trusted you.

1321
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:36,680
We've been doing this long before we met you.

1322
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:37,800
I don't care what you do.

1323
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,100
But if you wrong your family
and fellow countrymen,

1324
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:42,390
your children will forever live in shame.

1325
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,010
Stop the boat!

1326
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,550
What is it?

1327
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:49,430
The gold!

1328
01:14:58,890 --> 01:14:59,350
What's wrong?

1329
01:14:59,480 --> 01:14:59,890
Nothing!

1330
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:01,230
Stabilize the boat!

1331
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,060
How could this happen?

1332
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:25,770
It was alright just now.

1333
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:26,880
The gold is too heavy,

1334
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:28,310
and the trunk has been soaking for too long.

1335
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,050
They just fell off.

1336
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:30,680
I thought you had it all worked out!

1337
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:32,100
You didn't do it right.

1338
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:33,840
You tied the rope to the wrong end!

1339
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:34,890
It's your fault!

1340
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:35,800
Me?

1341
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:37,550
Shut up! It's your responsibility!

1342
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:39,800
It isn't the fault of any one person.

1343
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:42,180
We could return and salvage it later.

1344
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:42,930
Right.

1345
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,100
Salvage my ass!

1346
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:46,720
Everything belongs to the pirates around here!

1347
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:49,260
Consider this travel fee...

1348
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:53,060
Pirates in this area are from seven nations.

1349
01:15:53,190 --> 01:15:54,770
Enough! Knock it off!

1350
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,430
If this is any consolation,

1351
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:57,890
I still have one here.

1352
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,510
Whoever needs money can have it.

1353
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:04,640
You are luckier than her great-grandfather.

1354
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:06,680
At least you won't go home empty-handed.

1355
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,760
True.

1356
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:11,760
Someone did once try to take them home.

1357
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:14,390
Still these gold remain on Mother Earth.

1358
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,560
Seven groups of pirates now watch over them.

1359
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:18,300
Safer than in a bank vault!

1360
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,270
Let's leave them here undisturbed.

1361
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:32,840
Mark the coordinates. Hurry!

1362
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:34,590
It's gone!

1363
01:16:34,730 --> 01:16:35,840
What? What?!

1364
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:37,090
Where has it gone?

1365
01:16:37,230 --> 01:16:37,970
Get into the water?

1366
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,390
You can't get into the water to get it?

1367
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,810
You go get it.

1368
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,720
Professor Guan,

1369
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:53,930
Professor Guan, please come
and assist our investigation

1370
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:55,350
on the theft of the bronze heads' data.

1371
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:57,590
Just follow my instructions,

1372
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:03,430
<i>Today, the sale of a bronze rams' head
and a bronze snake's head</i>

1373
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:06,140
<i>has set a new record
at an art auction in London.</i>

1374
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:09,470
<i>The last one, the dragon,
is expected to sell for even more.</i>

1375
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,850
<i>The sale of the bronze heads
has provoked much controversy.</i>

1376
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:17,600
<i>Calls for repatriation of relics
are intensifying.</i>

1377
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,970
<i>We don't want our patriotic sentiment</i>

1378
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:20,890
<i>to be hijacked by others.</i>

1379
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:24,060
<i>We appreciate the young
for expressing their views.</i>

1380
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:25,430
<i>The auctioning of historical relics
from illegal sources,</i>

1381
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,770
<i>will only encourage more criminal activities.</i>

1382
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:31,390
<i>Those who plunder relics are worse than thieves!</i>

1383
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,060
Yes!

1384
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:38,510
The golden mask of a pharaoh's concubine

1385
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,220
and the secret smiling Buddha
were passed in an auction today,

1386
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:46,220
affected by the increasing international uproar

1387
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:50,730
Police.

1388
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:52,590
Do you know these people?

1389
01:17:57,060 --> 01:17:59,680
<i>In breaking news, MP Corporation has announced</i>

1390
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:02,770
<i>it has won the right to
auction off the bronze</i>

1391
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:05,560
<i>the piece will go to market as soon as possible.</i>

1392
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:07,430
I've called you more than 7,000

1393
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:08,640
Just say the word.

1394
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:10,810
From now on, in future, forever and ever...

1395
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:12,800
I won't call or bother you again.

1396
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:14,270
We know where it is!

1397
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:16,090
Where is what?

1398
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:20,090
The Dragon-head!

1399
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:22,430
MP will put it up for auction next week!

1400
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,640
They've had it all along!

1401
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:27,640
We could never have gotten that bonus.

1402
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:29,510
We've been fooled.

1403
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,510
We behaved like amateurs!

1404
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,180
Jonathan lied to us.

1405
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:34,680
He has conspired with MP.

1406
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:36,770
I figure they beat up those students, too.

1407
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:49,480
Is it true that
two students from your organization

1408
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,930
were badly beaten up?

1409
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:52,520
Sorry, we cannot comment on this.

1410
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,380
Okay.

1411
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,100
Thank you.

1412
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:55,390
Sir, care to comment? No comment.

1413
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,100
Madam, please

1414
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:57,310
Oh! These reporters!

1415
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,510
<i>...to demonstrate their discontent
with the sale of these relics</i>

1416
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,810
The crown jewel was originally

1417
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:05,270
an Indian national treasure of India.

1418
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:07,060
Why is it that our historical relics

1419
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:09,890
are on permanent display in foreign museums?!

1420
01:19:10,190 --> 01:19:12,390
<i>In time for the Chinese Year of the Dragon,</i>

1421
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,680
<i>I present the bronze Dragon-head.</i>

1422
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:17,550
<i>Starting price 60 million euros.</i>

1423
01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:19,300
<i>National heritage, NOT FOR SALE!</i>

1424
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:20,390
<i>Cultural relics from many countries</i>

1425
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,680
<i>were pillaged and ended up abroad.</i>

1426
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:24,850
<i>They include the star of today's auction,</i>

1427
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:27,560
<i>the renowned bronze Dragon-head.</i>

1428
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:30,090
Hello.

1429
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:32,350
Are you sure?

1430
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,930
I will come over right away.

1431
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:35,930
Tell my sister I will be back soon.

1432
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:37,270
What? I will be back soon.

1433
01:19:37,390 --> 01:19:40,430
Ladies and gentlemen, are there any bids?

1434
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:42,520
Ten euro!

1435
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:48,180
Pass!

1436
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:54,270
<i>Any comment on the Dragon-head unsold?</i>

1437
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:56,060
<i>Will the Dragon-head re-auction again?</i>

1438
01:19:56,190 --> 01:19:59,800
<i>Do you think the unsold affect
the reputation of MP Corporation?</i>

1439
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,430
Take more at different angles!

1440
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,050
Michelle, send this to Coco. Quickly!

1441
01:20:08,810 --> 01:20:10,300
Take a few more with this.

1442
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:17,520
What interview?

1443
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,680
- I don't give interviews.
- An important call.

1444
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:20,520
Hello.

1445
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,350
Boss.

1446
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,010
We caught three students. What now?

1447
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:23,880
What did they do?

1448
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:25,230
Same as previous two.

1449
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:26,340
They took photos again.

1450
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,470
Lock them up first.

1451
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,260
Is there really no other solution?

1452
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:30,930
I don't want it to drag on forever.

1453
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:33,560
I've been thinking about this all morning.

1454
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:34,970
Thanks!

1455
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,140
Johnny, Tommy

1456
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:38,180
Please give this letter to...

1457
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,100
Take it easy with women.

1458
01:20:41,230 --> 01:20:42,680
Be cool, just like me!

1459
01:20:43,730 --> 01:20:45,260
Hello?

1460
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,470
I know you! I recognise the voice.

1461
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,810
Your calls finally returned!

1462
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:53,020
No, I'm not busy.

1463
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:55,010
They're gone.

1464
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:56,510
Good.

1465
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,640
Anything, whatever you say

1466
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,850
Chinese, Japanese, Italian or French

1467
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:08,060
Fine. Love 'em all...

1468
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:10,220
Eh, sure.

1469
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:12,060
Okay.

1470
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:13,770
I agree.

1471
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:15,130
Good choice!

1472
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:16,480
I agree.

1473
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:19,010
Great! I'll wait for you,

1474
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:20,230
until the end of time!

1475
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:22,310
Good. Yes, bye bye!

1476
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:28,510
Yes! Yes!

1477
01:21:29,770 --> 01:21:31,600
I knew you'd call me back!

1478
01:21:33,230 --> 01:21:36,300
As a man sows, so shall he reap.

1479
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:39,050
God helps those who help themselves.

1480
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:40,350
Coco is here.

1481
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,010
Who?

1482
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:43,480
Coco. She's looking for you.

1483
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:45,760
What does she want?

1484
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:50,890
A letter for me?

1485
01:21:57,730 --> 01:21:59,930
Are those students okay?

1486
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:01,680
Three more are missing.

1487
01:22:01,810 --> 01:22:03,050
What?

1488
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:04,350
My brother,

1489
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,590
<i>Lily'</i>

1490
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:06,810
<i>and Michelle.</i>

1491
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:11,720
I grew up with my kid brother.

1492
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:14,060
Before my father passed away,

1493
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:18,510
he told me to look after him.

1494
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:21,470
He's my only family now.

1495
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:24,930
He is also our family's future.

1496
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:27,470
We're all passionate about

1497
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,520
each making our own contributions
to our countries.

1498
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:31,600
But now,

1499
01:22:31,730 --> 01:22:33,390
two of us are lying in hospital beds,

1500
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,140
and three of us are missing.

1501
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:37,430
And we don't know if they are still alive.

1502
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:39,520
I beg you.

1503
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:40,770
Pull yourself together.

1504
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:42,350
Have you contacted the police?

1505
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:44,890
I've tried everything.

1506
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:48,260
You are my very last resort.

1507
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:50,890
I'd love to help whenever I can.

1508
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:53,430
But these people

1509
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:56,020
I'm sorry for being a nuisance.

1510
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:02,350
Professor Guan is detained by police

1511
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,470
for giving me those data.

1512
01:23:14,810 --> 01:23:16,220
Why are you crying?

1513
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:47,020
<i>Mom & Dad, do you really have ti do this?</i>

1514
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:52,930
Coco said her brother disappeared

1515
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:54,890
while spying on MP after the aborted auction.

1516
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:57,060
MP must have something to do with this.

1517
01:23:57,190 --> 01:23:58,390
There are only trees, nothing else.

1518
01:23:58,520 --> 01:23:59,100
Where's the proof?

1519
01:23:59,230 --> 01:23:59,840
Let's check it out!

1520
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:01,220
Aren't you a compassionate person?

1521
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:02,560
I feel more for you.

1522
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:04,220
Is this what you really want?

1523
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:06,140
He insist on it! It's over between us!

1524
01:24:06,270 --> 01:24:07,810
We can't tolerate each other.

1525
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:09,390
What does that mean?

1526
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,730
You stink,
he disgrace himself in public, or what?

1527
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:13,720
Don't give up until you've really tried.

1528
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:15,640
Two grown-ups behaving worse than a child.

1529
01:24:15,770 --> 01:24:17,810
At least your daughter wrote.
What have you done?

1530
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:19,220
We are destined to fail.

1531
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:20,310
Failure?

1532
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:21,600
Those who fail look for excuses.

1533
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:23,010
Those who succeed look for ways.

1534
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:24,980
Stop patronizing me! Lives are at stake!

1535
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:26,560
Or it will be too late!

1536
01:24:26,690 --> 01:24:29,470
It's easy to make rash promises. But how?

1537
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,890
Like you said, until you've tried

1538
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:32,050
you must not give up!

1539
01:24:32,190 --> 01:24:32,680
<i>Hey JC!</i>

1540
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:34,180
Jonathan!

1541
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:35,270
<i>What's up?</i>

1542
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:38,140
I've just found the Roses.

1543
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:39,630
<i>Good! I'll come right over.</i>

1544
01:24:40,230 --> 01:24:41,470
That's my way!

1545
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:42,970
Speak!

1546
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:44,810
I didn't lie about MP's address.

1547
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:45,390
Why would I lie about it?

1548
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,380
Sure, I believe you.

1549
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:49,140
But you knew all along MP had dragon-head,
didn't you?

1550
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:51,180
We'd never get that bonus, would we?

1551
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:52,520
How would I know?

1552
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:53,880
We're old partners, why would I lie to you?

1553
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:54,850
You've never lied to me?

1554
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:56,760
Of course not! Why would I?

1555
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,430
What are you doing?

1556
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,350
This

1557
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,840
This is the world's most powerful acid.

1558
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:04,060
I formulated it specially for you.

1559
01:25:04,190 --> 01:25:05,100
Have you ever lied to me?

1560
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:06,770
Yes.

1561
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:08,560
I lied to you from day one.

1562
01:25:08,690 --> 01:25:09,640
From day one

1563
01:25:14,230 --> 01:25:15,260
I've told you everything.

1564
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:16,630
Why did you do that for?

1565
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:21,730
Fruity Fruit salt?

1566
01:25:22,270 --> 01:25:23,480
Genius!

1567
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:30,930
You came all the way to see me,

1568
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:33,270
just to cut out the middlemen?

1569
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:34,810
They are all blood-suckers.

1570
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:37,430
Jonathan lied about the Dragon-head.

1571
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:40,010
Can't blame him entirely.

1572
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:42,060
We had the Dragon-head all along.

1573
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:43,680
I just forgot about it.

1574
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:45,720
Never mind. In our line of business,

1575
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:48,220
we're used to conning each other

1576
01:25:49,230 --> 01:25:50,590
Where is the Roses?

1577
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:02,010
We wouldn't have brought it
if it's a fake.

1578
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:04,010
I still have to examine it.

1579
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:06,060
It cannot leave our sight.

1580
01:26:06,190 --> 01:26:07,140
Sure.

1581
01:26:10,350 --> 01:26:11,140
We are ready to begin.

1582
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:12,430
Just go ahead.

1583
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,260
Check this out for me.

1584
01:26:16,190 --> 01:26:18,270
I can't clone one so quickly.

1585
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:22,100
Verify this.

1586
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:23,840
Wait here.

1587
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,260
Mind if we look around?

1588
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:27,430
Be my guest.

1589
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:30,140
An authentication center underneath a vineyard?

1590
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:32,010
A hub for counterfeiting, actually.

1591
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:33,350
Billions of dollars of turnover each year.

1592
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:36,010
Everything is under their control.

1593
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:39,850
Wasn't that stolen
from an European museum earlier?

1594
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:41,180
Almost an exact replica!

1595
01:26:41,310 --> 01:26:43,890
Artistes here are all masters
in their own right.

1596
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:45,810
But they won't be famous in their lifetime.

1597
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:48,770
Keep an eye on upstairs.

1598
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:53,140
What are they doing?

1599
01:26:53,270 --> 01:26:55,260
Sandblasting a porcelain vase,

1600
01:26:55,390 --> 01:26:58,590
which will then be treated chemically,

1601
01:26:58,730 --> 01:27:01,090
<i>and ends up like an age-old antique.</i>

1602
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:04,190
<i>Layers of Chinese Xuan paper can be separated.</i>

1603
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:05,470
<i>This is an original.</i>

1604
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,260
<i>Peel it apart and you'll get two originals!</i>

1605
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:08,980
<i>You can make 5 or 6 copies out of it!</i>

1606
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:09,810
<i>But each copy would be too thin.</i>

1607
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:10,930
<i>What about that?</i>

1608
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,600
<i>That's silk, which cannot be peeled off.</i>

1609
01:27:12,730 --> 01:27:15,850
<i>So they slice it up into 8 parts for sale.</i>

1610
01:27:16,390 --> 01:27:18,510
<i>How imaginative!</i>

1611
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:20,890
Fragments of excavated relics,

1612
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:22,260
<i>can be perfectly restored,</i>

1613
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:24,810
<i>by forging with a replica.</i>

1614
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:26,930
<i>So it's partly real partly fake.</i>

1615
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:28,550
When it is exposed to X-ray,

1616
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:31,720
a brand new vase can become 1,000-year-old.

1617
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:33,510
They are so resourceful!

1618
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:35,480
Is there anything real on the market?

1619
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,010
9 out of 1O are fakes.

1620
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:39,380
Pity the rich and famous!

1621
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:41,810
This way.

1622
01:27:43,810 --> 01:27:44,970
JC

1623
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,720
Who's that?

1624
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:49,590
Probably one of Vulture's men.

1625
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,390
<i>What is this?</i>

1626
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:52,850
<i>This one</i>

1627
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:57,260
<i>A special furnace to emulate carbon emissions.</i>

1628
01:27:57,390 --> 01:27:59,390
<i>Designed to fool antique experts.</i>

1629
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,060
<i>Its technology hasn't yet been perfected.</i>

1630
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:05,760
<i>Fuel and catalyst can only be added manually.</i>

1631
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:07,230
<i>I can't believe they dare to go this far.</i>

1632
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:09,840
<i>It looks crude. Is it dangerous?</i>

1633
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,800
<i>Deception is always risky.</i>

1634
01:28:14,230 --> 01:28:15,970
Nice to see you, JC!

1635
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:23,050
Did you lose your tongue?

1636
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:24,970
I don't want to see you.

1637
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:26,390
Oh! Come on, man.

1638
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:27,550
Who's this guy?

1639
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:29,680
This is JC.

1640
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:31,930
A big name in the business.

1641
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:34,350
Reputations can be deceiving.

1642
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:35,970
Competitor?

1643
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:37,390
We're not the same.

1644
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,980
We'd never do what he does.

1645
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:39,930
What?

1646
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,260
Don't be so cocksure, alright?

1647
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:44,640
Whatever you do, I can do better.

1648
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:53,480
Vulture, you stole a Buddha
from a Southeast Asian temple.

1649
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:54,560
That's right.

1650
01:28:54,690 --> 01:28:58,480
They thought it was the work of a neighbor.

1651
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:02,560
It sparked a border war,
killing thousands of people.

1652
01:29:02,690 --> 01:29:04,180
People die.

1653
01:29:06,190 --> 01:29:07,600
That's their business.

1654
01:29:08,190 --> 01:29:10,680
You're the scumbag of our business.

1655
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,730
You know the last person who called me that

1656
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:15,260
is no longer breathing.

1657
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:16,600
Uh yeah?

1658
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:23,510
S-C-U-M-B-A-G!

1659
01:29:24,270 --> 01:29:25,600
Scumbag.

1660
01:29:26,890 --> 01:29:30,010
I can kick your ass
without leaving this couch.

1661
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:35,760
Show me.

1662
01:29:55,190 --> 01:29:56,600
You lose!

1663
01:29:56,730 --> 01:29:58,810
Still Touching.

1664
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:17,590
Touching.

1665
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,600
<i>Stop!</i>

1666
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:23,930
You can go now.

1667
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:25,270
Have a good vacation.

1668
01:31:25,390 --> 01:31:26,730
Good night!

1669
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,060
What are you guys doing?

1670
01:31:34,190 --> 01:31:35,850
Just checking the furniture.

1671
01:31:37,770 --> 01:31:39,390
Cheap imitation.

1672
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:42,310
Hey boys, take it outside. Not here.

1673
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:43,680
Okay?

1674
01:31:43,810 --> 01:31:44,970
It's the real thing. Be careful with it.

1675
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:46,340
Wow, The Roses!

1676
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:47,680
- Your eleven o'clock.
-Leave them here when you're done.

1677
01:31:47,810 --> 01:31:49,390
We'll clear them later.

1678
01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:53,980
You'll be paid tomorrow, as usual.

1679
01:31:55,270 --> 01:31:57,640
Your price is too high. Let's wait for Dad.

1680
01:31:57,770 --> 01:31:59,510
I can give you a discount.

1681
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,560
But I want three people.

1682
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:02,930
What?

1683
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,840
Those you locked up upstairs.

1684
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:10,680
I don't understand.

1685
01:32:11,140 --> 01:32:12,510
Let me show you.

1686
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,220
That confirms my suspicion.

1687
01:32:18,890 --> 01:32:21,230
Prove it if you can.

1688
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:28,730
I will.

1689
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:31,180
<i>Stop him!</i>

1690
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:34,020
<i>I said stop!</i>

1691
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:34,980
<i>Don't move!</i>

1692
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:36,310
<i>Don't let him get away</i>

1693
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:40,850
<i>Stop!</i>

1694
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:42,760
<i>Stop him!</i>

1695
01:33:16,730 --> 01:33:18,090
<i>There he is, let's go! He's down there!</i>

1696
01:33:41,310 --> 01:33:43,430
Open the door! Hurry!

1697
01:34:08,730 --> 01:34:11,640
JC, what have you proved?

1698
01:34:29,270 --> 01:34:31,010
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

1699
01:34:44,890 --> 01:34:47,600
I've been looking for a punchbag all day.

1700
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:49,600
You've just hit the jack-pot.

1701
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:56,930
Vulture, do something.

1702
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:58,350
No, it's girl-on-girl time.

1703
01:34:58,480 --> 01:34:59,640
Oh. yeah!

1704
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:01,930
Show me what you've got!

1705
01:35:43,390 --> 01:35:44,880
He's over there! Get him!

1706
01:35:47,770 --> 01:35:48,930
Is he still going?

1707
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:19,850
Vulture, take him out!

1708
01:36:20,980 --> 01:36:22,430
That's not a real fight, man!

1709
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:25,600
Only pretty little sissy
with no balls fight that way.

1710
01:36:25,730 --> 01:36:27,890
Now, that is a fair game.

1711
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:23,390
Oh! So ugly!

1712
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:31,720
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

1713
01:38:31,850 --> 01:38:32,970
Get him!

1714
01:38:40,270 --> 01:38:41,300
<i>It's gonna blow!</i>

1715
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:45,510
<i>Get out of there, it's gonna blow!</i>

1716
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:47,260
<i>Run! Quick!</i>

1717
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,850
Wu, are you okay?

1718
01:39:24,770 --> 01:39:25,930
Martin!

1719
01:39:29,850 --> 01:39:31,010
Katie!

1720
01:39:32,730 --> 01:39:33,720
You alright?

1721
01:39:33,850 --> 01:39:35,180
I'm okay

1722
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,010
Michael!

1723
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:45,430
Dad!

1724
01:39:50,190 --> 01:39:51,020
Bonnie!

1725
01:39:51,140 --> 01:39:52,680
Here, I'm fine.

1726
01:39:55,390 --> 01:39:56,810
Lawrence.

1727
01:39:56,940 --> 01:39:59,970
JC, finally we meet.

1728
01:40:01,270 --> 01:40:02,730
Daddy!

1729
01:40:02,850 --> 01:40:03,930
JC did it!

1730
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:05,350
Shut up!

1731
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:08,010
You idiot, I'd kill you!

1732
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:09,810
What did I teach you?

1733
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:12,270
We don't kidnap people! We make fake things!

1734
01:40:12,390 --> 01:40:15,430
Boss, I think we need to leave ASAP.

1735
01:40:17,020 --> 01:40:17,880
Is that real?

1736
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:19,480
It is real.

1737
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:20,220
You had it tested?

1738
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:21,890
Yes, I have tested it.

1739
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:30,590
JC, I wish we could've met
under different circumstances.

1740
01:40:30,730 --> 01:40:32,560
I wish you'd make real things.

1741
01:40:32,690 --> 01:40:34,550
Well, you certainly took care of that.

1742
01:40:34,690 --> 01:40:37,550
And for your trouble,
I'm going to keep this free-of-charge.

1743
01:40:37,690 --> 01:40:39,970
Now, I certainly hope you'll escort

1744
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:42,260
these nice, young people home, safely,

1745
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:44,480
and that you and I
can resume our relationship.

1746
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:45,720
Is that a deal?

1747
01:40:47,770 --> 01:40:48,510
Deal.

1748
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:50,060
Get 'em out of here.

1749
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:54,180
Oh. Sorry about the dragon.

1750
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:57,350
I guess it just disappeared. No extra zero.

1751
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:59,140
Enjoy your Roses.

1752
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:02,850
Dad, you're letting them off too easy.

1753
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:04,390
Interpol's onto this place.

1754
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:07,010
We have to destroy it anyway.
He just saved us the trouble.

1755
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:09,810
Salvage anything that's worth anything,

1756
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:11,640
then get the hell outta here.

1757
01:41:11,770 --> 01:41:13,680
Make sure Frankie takes the blame.

1758
01:41:13,810 --> 01:41:14,640
Okay, Dad.

1759
01:41:14,770 --> 01:41:15,600
I have a job for you!

1760
01:41:15,730 --> 01:41:16,720
Yes, sir!

1761
01:41:16,850 --> 01:41:18,890
The antique market has tanked

1762
01:41:19,020 --> 01:41:21,430
because of these whiny hippies
and their protests.

1763
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:23,300
I want to teach the world a lesson,

1764
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:24,850
starting with the Dragon-head.

1765
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:25,930
How?

1766
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:28,470
Time for the dragon to fly.

1767
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:31,880
<i>Vulture!</i>

1768
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:34,480
What a pity!

1769
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:37,930
<i>Auction houses have come under pressure</i>

1770
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:40,140
<i>after protests broke out around the world</i>

1771
01:41:40,270 --> 01:41:42,260
<i>calling for the return of national treasures.</i>

1772
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:44,850
<i>MP announced that
if the sale of the Dragon-head</i>

1773
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:48,300
<i>is affected by the protests,
they will be forced to act.</i>

1774
01:41:48,940 --> 01:41:50,770
<i>Let's begin our private auction!</i>

1775
01:41:50,890 --> 01:41:52,380
<i>For the precious Dragon-head,</i>

1776
01:41:54,810 --> 01:41:56,300
Thank you so much!

1777
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:57,800
Great news!

1778
01:41:57,940 --> 01:42:00,520
Chinese businesses worldwide donated $50M!

1779
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:02,350
So what? The government won't accept

1780
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,760
anything that is acquired from an auction.

1781
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:07,180
Tell them we will buy it first
and keep it in trust for them.

1782
01:42:07,310 --> 01:42:09,640
No, whoever buys it will become public enemy.

1783
01:42:09,770 --> 01:42:12,060
<i>The second and last time
it will be up for auction,</i>

1784
01:42:12,190 --> 01:42:14,020
<i>with no starting price.</i>

1785
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:16,140
<i>Do I have any opening bid?</i>

1786
01:42:16,690 --> 01:42:18,970
<i>With the international press waiting for answer,</i>

1787
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:22,640
<i>MP has threatened to dump the head into a volcano</i>

1788
01:42:22,770 --> 01:42:25,100
<i>if no bids are received before noon today.</i>

1789
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:26,810
<i>You can see the volcano behind me.</i>

1790
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:29,800
<i>The Dragon-head might be consumed by it.</i>

1791
01:42:29,940 --> 01:42:30,930
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,</i>

1792
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:33,350
<i>Our mid-day deadline is fast approaching.</i>

1793
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:35,760
<i>I've yet to receive an opening bid.</i>

1794
01:42:35,890 --> 01:42:36,880
<i>If the auction is aborted again,</i>

1795
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:38,430
<i>MP will dump the Dragon-head</i>

1796
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:41,100
<i>into the live volcano in front of us.</i>

1797
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:47,020
<i>At this stage,
I haven't received any opening bid.</i>

1798
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:48,730
Fair warning.

1799
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:51,680
<i>Fair warning.</i>

1800
01:42:51,810 --> 01:42:53,430
Last chance.

1801
01:42:54,770 --> 01:42:56,760
This item is unsold.

1802
01:43:00,810 --> 01:43:03,970
Boss! The Dragon head's been
taken off the auction block.

1803
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:07,220
Dump it!

1804
01:43:09,690 --> 01:43:11,930
Alright! Guys! Let's do this!

1805
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:21,140
<i>It's really happening.</i>

1806
01:43:21,270 --> 01:43:22,730
<i>They've started their mission.</i>

1807
01:43:22,850 --> 01:43:24,340
<i>Looking at the three skydivers,</i>

1808
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:27,440
<i>we can clearly see
one of them is holding the Dragon-head.</i>

1809
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:29,300
They're dumping it!

1810
01:43:32,270 --> 01:43:32,930
<i>For the whole process,</i>

1811
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:35,720
<i>MP Corporation has named this mission.</i>

1812
01:43:35,850 --> 01:43:37,680
<i>Let the Dragon Fly!</i>

1813
01:43:48,190 --> 01:43:50,550
What is this? A 4th diver has appeared

1814
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:52,890
Check over there!

1815
01:46:03,810 --> 01:46:04,970
<i>Wake up!</i>

1816
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:08,600
<i>Wake up!</i>

1817
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:18,060
<i>Save her!</i>

1818
01:46:18,190 --> 01:46:19,430
<i>Thank you!</i>

1819
01:46:34,230 --> 01:46:35,430
<i>He just let go of the Dragon-head!</i>

1820
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:37,050
<i>It's falling towards the volcano!</i>

1821
01:47:10,060 --> 01:47:12,020
<i>They simply have to open their chutes now!</i>

1822
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:13,600
<i>But they're still free-falling!</i>

1823
01:47:13,730 --> 01:47:15,640
<i>Very dangerous!</i>

1824
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:27,310
<i>A moment ago,
we captured a picture of this 4th jumper,</i>

1825
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:28,800
<i>but we still cannot identify him.</i>

1826
01:47:28,940 --> 01:47:30,100
It's Martin!

1827
01:47:30,230 --> 01:47:31,310
Martin!

1828
01:47:32,190 --> 01:47:33,930
How could it be him?

1829
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:41,390
<i>You are a condor without wings,</i>

1830
01:47:45,850 --> 01:47:47,890
<i>don't even think you can beat me.</i>

1831
01:47:50,690 --> 01:47:52,890
<i>No! You're crazy!</i>

1832
01:47:54,850 --> 01:47:57,810
<i>The mysterious man has just lost his chute!</i>

1833
01:47:57,940 --> 01:48:01,930
<i>Not even the Dragon-head can save him!</i>

1834
01:49:55,310 --> 01:49:56,680
It's yours!

1835
01:49:58,850 --> 01:50:00,840
You're really something else, brother.

1836
01:50:33,190 --> 01:50:35,770
<i>In our special report, MP Corporation chief,</i>

<i>Lawrence Morgan, and his son, Michael,</i>

<i>Czarina Catherine of Russia's staff,</i>

1846
01:50:57,270 --> 01:51:00,810
<i>an lncan jewelry box decorated
with a golden eagle.</i>

1847
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:03,050
<i>And don't forget the Star of Arabia.</i>

1848
01:51:03,190 --> 01:51:06,350
<i>Now nobody knows who this mystery sender is.</i>

1849
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:08,010
<i>Quite amazing, isn't it?</i>

1850
01:51:08,140 --> 01:51:10,350
<i>In similar news, Japan has just announced</i>

1851
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:13,970
<i>it will return five ancient books to Korea.</i>

1852
01:51:15,390 --> 01:51:16,510
Yes!

1853
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:18,480
Hi! My name is Anna

1854
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:20,840
I'm be happy on behalf of
the Association of Cultural Preservation,

1855
01:51:20,980 --> 01:51:23,510
I give you this as
a token of our appreciation.

1856
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:24,850
Thank you very much.

1857
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:25,640
No need to thank him.

1858
01:51:25,770 --> 01:51:27,760
He has sold more than he donates.

1859
01:51:29,230 --> 01:51:31,060
Look, Professor Guan has been freed.

1860
01:51:31,190 --> 01:51:33,770
Mr. Liao, your wife has just given birth!

1861
01:51:33,890 --> 01:51:35,010
I am coming!

1862
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:36,680
I've got to go! You run along.

1863
01:51:36,810 --> 01:51:37,390
I'll go and check it out.

1864
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:40,230
JC, you're the man!

1865
01:51:42,850 --> 01:51:44,140
<i>- You dated me!
-Said you'd show up for sure!</i>

1866
01:51:44,270 --> 01:51:45,300
It's loud! You listen to it.

1867
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,020
<i>- I'm leaving!
-I've eaten every cuisine on offer here!</i>

1868
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:48,730
<i>And still you're nowhere</i>

1869
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:51,270
Coco!

1870
01:51:51,390 --> 01:51:52,230
BYE-bye!

1871
01:51:52,350 --> 01:51:53,680
Catherine!

1872
01:51:53,810 --> 01:51:55,430
I have something for you.

1873
01:51:56,640 --> 01:51:57,980
Emperor Qianlong's Autumn Hunt?

1874
01:51:58,100 --> 01:51:59,970
I learned from you. I stole it!

1875
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:02,470
Bankers won't know
how to appreciate it anyway.

1876
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:02,930
You

1877
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:06,470
Since we parted, I've been learning Chinese.

1878
01:52:07,390 --> 01:52:08,180
It's wonderful!

1879
01:52:08,310 --> 01:52:09,770
A present from my sister.

1880
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:15,060
Purple!

1881
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:16,510
How is JC?

1882
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:17,550
He's come around. You can see him.

1883
01:52:17,690 --> 01:52:18,930
I'll go to see him now.

1884
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:21,600
Emperor Qianlong's Autumn Hunt?

1885
01:52:21,730 --> 01:52:23,060
Check it out!

1886
01:52:25,140 --> 01:52:27,060
Try to settle your differences.

1887
01:52:28,770 --> 01:52:30,130
Mama!

1888
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:36,720
<i>Only the efforts of two half-decent people</i>

1889
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:39,310
<i>can give her a decent environment to grow up.</i>

1890
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:44,770
If you are willing,

1891
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:47,350
we can start all over again.

1892
01:52:52,350 --> 01:52:53,140
It's a girl!

1893
01:52:53,270 --> 01:52:54,430
Come and see for yourself!

1894
01:52:55,270 --> 01:52:56,180
Congratulations!

1895
01:52:56,310 --> 01:52:57,180
What's her name? So lovely!

1896
01:52:57,310 --> 01:52:58,350
Pax! Pax?

1897
01:52:58,480 --> 01:52:59,760
It's Latin for peace.

1898
01:52:59,890 --> 01:53:01,850
JC gave me four names to choose

1899
01:53:02,640 --> 01:53:04,230
Sis? Sis?

1900
01:53:06,690 --> 01:53:07,520
Who is she?

1901
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:08,510
The voice-mail lady!

1902
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:09,300
Let's check it out!

1903
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:10,890
I will be right back.

1904
01:53:15,390 --> 01:53:17,680
Come over here!

1905
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:19,560
Who is she?

1906
01:53:19,690 --> 01:53:21,520
He's going to be fine.
In fact, he is healing quickly.

1907
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:23,930
He could check out of here
within a week or two.

1908
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:25,600
Thank you.

1909
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:30,430
I was just thinking

1910
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:31,600
It's okay.

1911
01:53:32,270 --> 01:53:33,930
That was an old message.

1912
01:53:34,060 --> 01:53:35,970
Now I know what you've been up to.

1913
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:37,720
Get up!

1914
01:53:44,350 --> 01:53:45,390
<i>Action!</i>

1915
01:54:15,690 --> 01:54:16,720
<i>Stung my palms!</i>

1916
01:54:18,890 --> 01:54:20,560
<i>Get the dogs! Control them!</i>

1917
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:24,310
<i>Good boy.</i>

1918
01:54:25,730 --> 01:54:26,590
<i>Not again!</i>

1919
01:54:26,730 --> 01:54:27,720
<i>Get the dog!</i>

1920
01:54:58,730 --> 01:55:01,920
<i>Don't stand too close to the edge.
It's dangerous!</i>

1921
01:55:06,230 --> 01:55:08,840
<i>I'm here when it explodes!</i>

1922
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:43,850
<i>You really slapped me!</i>

1923
01:55:57,060 --> 01:55:58,220
<i>Stop it, it's NG already!</i>

1924
01:56:09,140 --> 01:56:11,980
<i>I'm very scared whenever
I have a dangerous performance.</i>

1925
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:13,430
<i>I think a lot.</i>

1926
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:16,180
<i>It might be my last shoot,</i>

1927
01:56:16,310 --> 01:56:18,550
<i>and the last one in my life.</i>

1928
01:56:28,060 --> 01:56:28,850
<i>Was it okay?</i>

1929
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:30,180
<i>We are not the same</i>

1930
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:31,600
<i>We are</i>

1931
01:56:31,730 --> 01:56:33,640
<i>We are not the same</i>

1932
01:56:33,770 --> 01:56:36,060
<i>We will never do what he does!</i>

1933
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:37,730
<i>Stay clear</i>

1934
01:56:37,850 --> 01:56:39,340
<i>Chubby, let's have some smoke!</i>

1935
01:56:40,020 --> 01:56:41,850
<i>Three, Two, One</i>

1936
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:53,060
<i>Machine can understand me.</i>

1937
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:56,890
<i>Hold tight!</i>
