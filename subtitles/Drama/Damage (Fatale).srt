<i>An elderly woman is trapped.
We need another line up here.</i>

6
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,919
<i>We got Captain Brewer's team
checking in.</i>

7
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:34,547
My grandmother can't walk!
She's trapped!

8
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,088
We'll handle it.

9
00:01:36,303 --> 00:01:40,135
Gordy, we got people trapped
at both ends of the hall.

10

Heads up. Let's do it.

-Get a baby ladder for this hole.
-Don't even think about it!

16
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:10,407
-You guys stay back! l'm going in!
-Gordy, goddamn it!

17
00:02:18,343 --> 00:02:22,293
Gordy! Get that last wall

00:02:42,324 --> 00:02:44,613
l can't breathe.

23
00:02:45,494 --> 00:02:47,652
-Put on my mask.
-Thank you.

24
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:51,115
Get your ass over here
and steady that ladder!

25
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:55,241
All right, get that woman out!

26
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:58,996
All right. lnhale, okay?
You got it. Come on.

27
00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:03,416
-You'll be okay.
-Steady that ladder! Here we go!

28
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:10,213
-We have a burn victim coming down!
-l got one coming down!

29
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:16,974
Take it easy with her.
Take her down.

30
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:30,988
Then we'll put a piece in here.

31
00:03:31,203 --> 00:03:35,746
And we got it. Look at that.
Wait till Mommy sees that.

32
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:40,169
We have to put the stand on now, okay?
Here we have the stand.

33
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,206
The blue goes to blue.

34
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:46,372
We put it right in here.
You see this one's blue here?

35
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:48,211
Hold the wings stable.

36
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:52,550
Good. There we are.
Look at this.

37
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:56,181
-Looks good.
-Good morning.

38
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:58,890
-Good morning.
-Look what we made.

39
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:03,731
-Matty, that is so cool.
-Show your mommy. Come on.

40
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:06,107
lt must have taken hours.

41
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,771
Since 4 a.m.
He was already up when l got home.

42
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,074
-He has a sore throat.
-He should see Dr. Bob.

43
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:15,699
Wanna see my Kobe Bryant slam-dunk?

44
00:04:15,912 --> 00:04:19,744
Sweetie, l don't think
you should be jumping around.

45
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,749
Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble.

46
00:04:23,962 --> 00:04:27,461
Matt is going to be clean
on the double.

47
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:33,420
Dr. Bob can see him at 11:30,
but l have to be at the hospital.

48
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:36,971
-l can take him. Can you pick him up?
-All right.

49
00:04:37,725 --> 00:04:41,259
Yeah, great. 11:30 is fine.
Thank you so much.

50
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:44,514
-Now you're clean.
-Come on, little buddy.

51
00:04:45,774 --> 00:04:51,314
Come on, you're all clean.
Oh, you're so slippery. Let's go.

52
00:04:56,951 --> 00:05:01,696
l told you that doctor would make
you feel better. Want a hot dog?

53
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:04,576
-How are you?
-Good.

54
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:07,912
-What can l do for you?
-Two hot dogs, a soda.

55
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:10,708
-What you want to drink?
-Orange juice.

56
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:13,039
Okay, two hot dogs.

57
00:05:23,977 --> 00:05:26,218
Here we go, bud.

58
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,519
lt's late. Where's Daddy?
He should have been here by now.

59
00:05:40,326 --> 00:05:43,362
Stay right around in here,
okay, honey?

60
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,875
Officer.

61
00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:44,208
Excuse me, officer.

62
00:06:44,428 --> 00:06:47,215
l'm just going to pick up my kid.

63
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:51,932
lf you don't mind, it's just going
to be a minute, okay? Thanks.

64
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:11,739
-There he is!
-Where?

65
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:19,368
-Well done. lt's all because of you.
-That's my job, sir.

66
00:07:21,338 --> 00:07:23,129
This way.

67
00:07:23,715 --> 00:07:25,375
Hi, Daddy.

68
00:07:28,428 --> 00:07:29,922
Hello.

69
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:35,923
See? l told you he'd be here.

70
00:07:50,782 --> 00:07:52,276
No!

71
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:15,799
ETA on those units!

72
00:08:16,098 --> 00:08:18,719
Get Gilly, Perry, Copeland
up here now.

73
00:08:18,892 --> 00:08:23,103
The agent in charge is coming.
l want paperwork in 10 minutes.

74
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:47,202
Gordy, we'll need
to start an lV line.

75
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:54,334
l need to get him to the hospital.
We can't get this glass out.

76
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,633
Device functioned
after a motorcade arrived.

77
00:09:00,848 --> 00:09:04,680
Targets: Colombian officials,
American intelligence.

78
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:08,179
Guy on the phone is Brandt.
ClA, works Colombia.

79
00:09:08,356 --> 00:09:12,685
The other's Shrub. Undersecretary
of State, Latin American affairs.

80
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,861
-Not a scratch on him.
-Surveillance cameras?

81
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:19,398
-We're pulling video now.
-Where's L.A.P.D. on it?

82
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:22,196
They know it's ours. They're helping.

83
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:27,077
-What's the body count?
-Two dozen injured. Nine dead...

84
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:31,751
...including ClA, American
and Colombian military, a mailman...

85
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:36,290
...a nurse and her little boy.
That's the father over there.

86
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:42,089
Gordy, we need to get you on a gurney.

87
00:10:14,168 --> 00:10:18,664
Call our contacts. l wanna know
who's responsible by day's end.

88
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,543
-Phipps, anti-terrorism.
-Peter Brandt.

89
00:10:21,717 --> 00:10:24,254
-l need to talk to him.
-Not today.

90
00:10:24,469 --> 00:10:27,304
Get the undersecretary to his hotel.

91
00:10:27,514 --> 00:10:29,340
-Keep me informed.
-Right.

92
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,725
Okay, l'll talk to you then.
Someone in your caravan was a target.

93
00:10:36,898 --> 00:10:41,476
-Terrorism. Everyone's a target.
-Shovel that on the press, not me.

94
00:10:41,694 --> 00:10:45,228
-l need to know what you know.
-When you're cleared.

95
00:10:45,406 --> 00:10:49,273
l won't tell that dad
the killer escaped due to protocol.

96
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:54,029
Tell him what you want. We're done
talking until you're cleared.

97
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:07,712
Excuse me, nurse. Excuse me.
Gordon Brewer, please.

98
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:16,676
-Jack.
-How you doing?

99
00:11:17,102 --> 00:11:18,976
Hey, Gordy.

100
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,388
-How is he?
-Could've been worse.

101
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:26,937
The glass missed his femoral artery
by a hair. He was lucky.

102
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:37,193
<i>Let me say, the full resources
of the United States...</i>

103
00:11:37,371 --> 00:11:39,862
<i>... will be employed to make clear...</i>

104
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:43,824
<i>...that we do not tolerate attacks
on our city.</i>

105
00:11:44,044 --> 00:11:47,460
<i>That said,
we must fight the temptation...</i>

106
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:51,415
<i>...to make hasty policy decisions
we may come to regret.</i>

107
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:54,548
<i>We can't allow
an anonymous criminal...</i>

108
00:11:54,763 --> 00:11:58,096
<i>...to unravel our partnership
with Colombia.</i>

109
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:01,175
<i>Who was the specific target?</i>

110
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:04,223
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

111
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:11,976
<i>-I won't speculate.
-What will the president do about it?</i>

112
00:12:12,196 --> 00:12:17,438
<i>-He's meeting with the Joint Chiefs.
-Was the State Department warned?</i>

113
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:18,857
What do we know?

114
00:12:19,036 --> 00:12:23,329
The president's coming on soon.
l doubt he'll say anything new.

115
00:12:23,498 --> 00:12:27,543
Turner says the bomb was hidden
in a police motorcycle.

116
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,248
-They don't know who triggered it.
-l saw a cop.

117
00:12:35,218 --> 00:12:37,294
l saw him.

118
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,926
Gordy, get back here! Goddamn it!

119
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:46,016
l saw him.

120
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:49,846
-Goddamn it, come here! Slow down!
-l saw him.

121
00:12:50,065 --> 00:12:52,223
You're not going anywhere!

122
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:56,399
Any problems, go through
Shrub's office over at State.

123
00:12:56,571 --> 00:13:00,783
That's right. Yes, he's one of us.
He can handle it.

124
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:05,739
ls Beckett there?
Or Moyers? He could help.

125
00:13:06,497 --> 00:13:10,281
Skin of his teeth, that guy.
Classic agency mold.

126
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:13,751
Get a copy of all visas
on a Colombian passport.

127
00:13:13,963 --> 00:13:18,292
-They're covering up for him.
-That's why they're called spooks.

128
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:23,425
Bastards. They must have used
some kind of liquid explosive.

129
00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:26,844
lf you'll follow me, sir.

130
00:13:27,184 --> 00:13:31,726
l just want to help.
Used to be with Bomb and Arson.

131
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:37,189
Right this way, sir.
l'll take you to Agent Phipps.

132
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,833
Gordy Brewer is here.

133
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:59,037
-The fireman?
-Yeah. Says he talked to the cop.

134
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,085
We appreciate you coming down.

135
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:10,088
We know this guy.
His name is Claudio Perrini.

136
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,717
<i>We think he's a terrorist
called El Lobo. The Wolf.</i>

137
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,931
Definitely the guy l bumped into.

138
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:21,192
l talked to him.
l told him l was picking up my son.

139
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,100
The son of a bitch smiled at me.

140
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:27,322
The bomb may have been set off
by cell phone.

141
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,364
-He have one?
-l don't know.

142
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:33,152
How long between when
you saw him and the explosion?

143
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:36,912
Five seconds.
Maybe 10 at the most.

144
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,167
-That's enough time to make a call?
-Maybe.

145
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:43,665
This could be tough to watch, sir.

146
00:14:46,008 --> 00:14:47,550
l was late.

147
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:50,377
They shouldn't have been there.

148
00:14:50,596 --> 00:14:54,214
-They shouldn't have.
-No, the bomber shouldn't have.

149
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:59,771
Peter Brandt, ClA, Latin American
section. He was one of the targets.

150
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,891
l'm sorry for your loss. lf there's
anything l can do for you...

151
00:15:05,109 --> 00:15:09,605
l promise, one way or the other,
we'll catch that son of a bitch.

152
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:14,868
How do l get ahold of you?

153
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:38,509
We're not at all separated from one
another. We all run the same course...

154
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:42,016
...and will find one another again.

155
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,223
We won't be apart,
for we live for Christ.

156
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:48,773
Now, we are united with Christ
as we go to him.

157
00:15:48,984 --> 00:15:53,397
We shall all be together
in Christ. Amen.

158
00:17:10,853 --> 00:17:12,347
<i>-This is Gordy.
-Anne.</i>

159
00:17:12,563 --> 00:17:17,355
<i>-And Matthew Brewer.
-Leave us a message.</i>

160
00:17:17,943 --> 00:17:22,071
<i>Mr. Brewer, my name's Ken Barnett
with Lateline.</i>

161
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:26,486
<i>We'd love to get you in the studio
to hear your story...</i>

162
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,071
<i>...in your own words.</i>

163
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:32,699
<i>If that's something that interests
you, call us at 552- 12...</i>

164
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:39,038
<i>Now back to Rick Garcia with more
on the bombing in Los Angeles.</i>

165
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:45,049
<i>I'm at the State Department, where
the counter-terrorism headquarters...</i>

166
00:17:45,219 --> 00:17:48,718
<i>...received a videotape
from El Lobo, or The Wolf...</i>

167
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:52,092
<i>...a Colombian terrorist
who is responsible...</i>

168
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:58,098
<i>...for at least 7 bombings, including
the most recent in Los Angeles.</i>

169
00:17:58,315 --> 00:18:00,984
<i>On behalf of the people
of Colombia...</i>

170
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:06,145
<i>...I claim responsibility
for the bombing in Los Angeles.</i>

171
00:18:06,364 --> 00:18:11,820
<i>The bombing was an act of self-defense
against American war criminals.</i>

172
00:18:12,036 --> 00:18:15,950
<i>As long as America continues
its aggression in Colombia...</i>

173
00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:18,792
<i>... we will bring the war home to you.</i>

174
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:22,328
<i>And you will not feel safe
in your own beds.</i>

175
00:18:22,546 --> 00:18:24,918
<i>Colombia is not your country.</i>

176
00:18:25,132 --> 00:18:30,007
<i>Get out now. Sangre o libertad.</i>

177
00:18:32,264 --> 00:18:34,885
<i>For more, Jenni Luz in Los Angeles.</i>

178
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,595
<i>I'm with Mr. Ortiz Dominguez of the
Latin American Solidarity Committee...</i>

179
00:18:40,772 --> 00:18:44,686
<i>...a group sympathetic
to the Army of Colombian Liberation.</i>

180
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,684
<i>Sir, you've characterized the ALC
as freedom fighters.</i>

181
00:18:48,904 --> 00:18:52,736
<i>Isn't the bombing here just a brutal
act of terrorism?</i>

182
00:18:52,908 --> 00:18:57,369
<i>The Wolf brought to the U.S.
what the U.S. brought to Colombia.</i>

183
00:18:57,537 --> 00:19:02,413
<i>The killing of innocent people like
Anne and Matt Brewer is terrorism.</i>

184
00:19:02,584 --> 00:19:05,585
<i>Their deaths are regrettable.</i>

185
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:09,246
<i>It's called collateral damage.</i>

186
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:20,013
<i>Ortiz, you want the call? CNN is
holding. Washington Post's on the line.</i>

187
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:25,183
<i>-Am I the only one here?
-Agent Crosby will relieve you soon.</i>

188
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:28,224
<i>New York Times is on one.</i>

189
00:19:28,442 --> 00:19:32,653
Put them on hold. That's my position.
l already told you this.

190
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:36,106
-Why should l change it?
-Collateral damage?

191
00:19:36,324 --> 00:19:40,156
-Who the fuck are you?
-l'll give you collateral damage.

192
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,865
Stop that!

193
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:46,156
lt looks like the fireman.
Move in. Go now! Go!

194
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:51,708
You want collateral? Right here.

195
00:19:51,922 --> 00:19:55,836
-What are you doing?!
-Want collateral damage? Here.

196
00:19:56,677 --> 00:19:58,005
What are you doing?!

197
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,426
-Where's The Wolf?
-l don't know!

198
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,054
-Tell me where The Wolf is!
-Put the bat down!

199
00:20:04,225 --> 00:20:05,933
-Fuck you!
-Take him down!

200
00:20:06,186 --> 00:20:07,514
l don't know!

201
00:20:12,942 --> 00:20:15,267
Turn it off.

202
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:17,813
Come on.

203
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:20,280
Just relax, Mr. Brewer.

204
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:24,358
-l have to cuff you.
-l'm Agent Collins with the FBl.

205
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:27,659
Bring your wrist right here, sir.

206
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:32,917
Take it easy.
You'll be all right.

207
00:20:33,295 --> 00:20:35,832
Just relax. lt's gonna be all right.

208
00:20:51,312 --> 00:20:54,348
l can't imagine
what you're feeling now...

209
00:20:54,523 --> 00:20:57,773
...but you can't take the law
in your own hands.

210
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:01,439
l think you already lost him.

211
00:21:01,655 --> 00:21:06,067
He's long gone. Otherwise, he wouldn't
have sent you that tape.

212
00:21:07,243 --> 00:21:09,283
-Am l under arrest?
-No.

213
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:12,745
We convinced Mr. Ortiz
to drop the charges.

214
00:21:12,957 --> 00:21:17,120
The truth is, we're pretty sure
The Wolf is back in Colombia.

215
00:21:31,016 --> 00:21:35,891
-l find this questioning offensive.
-You're the reason this occurred.

216
00:21:36,104 --> 00:21:41,229
You went to the Colombian consulate
with a plan to attack the guerrillas.

217
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:43,523
Then they tried to blow you up.

218
00:21:43,694 --> 00:21:48,107
-Senator, if you intend to argue...
-Mr. Brandt, l'm not arguing.

219
00:21:48,324 --> 00:21:53,448
l am telling you, your mission
in Colombia is terminated immediately.

220
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,699
With all due respect, senator...

221
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,750
...that is the worst thing
you can do now.

222
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,578
lt's not for discussion.

223
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:06,249
Peace talks will be arranged
between Colombia and the guerrillas.

224
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:09,923
This is insane.
You can't negotiate with terrorists!

225
00:22:10,094 --> 00:22:15,089
These guerrillas don't want peace.
All they want to do is sell cocaine.

226
00:22:15,308 --> 00:22:20,100
Senator, Peter Brandt has had
a great deal of experience...

227
00:22:20,312 --> 00:22:21,937
Spare me, Douglas.

228
00:22:22,148 --> 00:22:26,809
Brandt failed. All he's done is
bring the war home to American soil.

229
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:30,775
That is completely unacceptable,
and you know it.

230
00:22:30,947 --> 00:22:35,075
You have 72 hours to pull
your operatives out of Colombia.

231
00:22:35,285 --> 00:22:39,329
-Have you any questions, Mr. Brandt?
-None at all.

232
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:45,790
Damn it, Pete! Come here!

233
00:22:45,962 --> 00:22:51,038
Why call them Senate intelligence
hearings? They're all imbeciles.

234
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:54,509
l'm going back to Colombia
and kill them all.

235
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,886
We've been here before.
You know the drill.

236
00:22:58,098 --> 00:22:59,806
This will blow over.

237
00:23:00,017 --> 00:23:03,385
For now you're being reassigned
here to l-TAG.

238
00:23:03,603 --> 00:23:06,011
You can find this animal, Pete.

239
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:11,817
Just do it via satellite. All right?
You're okay.

240
00:23:19,243 --> 00:23:24,368
l'm sick of this crap. Get the plane
ready. We're leaving tonight.

241
00:23:25,124 --> 00:23:27,496
Another guy's saying he's The Wolf.

242
00:23:27,668 --> 00:23:29,956
-So?
-He asked for you by name.

243
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:34,998
And he knows unreleased details
about the bombing. Take it over here.

244
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:45,840
<i>-Who's this?
-You're tough to reach.</i>

245
00:23:46,018 --> 00:23:48,889
<i>-I tried for the last three weeks.
-Brewer?</i>

246
00:23:49,105 --> 00:23:52,853
You've been busy finding the man
who killed my family?

247
00:23:54,276 --> 00:23:55,521
<i>Right?</i>

248
00:23:55,694 --> 00:23:59,858
l understand you're anxious.
We'll keep you posted.

249
00:24:00,073 --> 00:24:03,822
Tell me the truth, Brandt.
You owe me that much.

250
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:06,663
<i>-You're not going after him.
-The truth?</i>

251
00:24:06,871 --> 00:24:12,458
The Colombian government's trying to
negotiate peace with the guerrillas.

252
00:24:13,044 --> 00:24:16,543
<i>We can't go in the guerrilla zone.
Bottom line is...</i>

253
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:21,292
...justice for your wife
and son isn't a priority.

254
00:24:55,084 --> 00:24:57,657
-Colonel.
-Peter, good to see you.

255
00:24:57,878 --> 00:25:00,036
l wasn't expecting you back.

256
00:25:00,214 --> 00:25:03,914
l won't hand the country
to a third-rate Che Guevara.

257
00:25:05,594 --> 00:25:09,805
-How are my boys?
-They're dying to get in the field.

258
00:25:16,062 --> 00:25:19,596
-On furlough from the psych unit?
-lsn't this it?

259
00:25:19,815 --> 00:25:22,520
-l need to talk to you.
-Okay.

260
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:35,157
-Gordy, how you doing?
-Come in.

261
00:25:35,372 --> 00:25:38,871
Meet a friend of mine, Ed Coonts.

262
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:41,367
-Sorry about your loss.
-Thank you.

263
00:25:41,586 --> 00:25:45,797
Ed spent two years as a military
adviser down in Colombia.

264
00:25:46,007 --> 00:25:48,498
He can help you.

265
00:25:50,428 --> 00:25:52,586
l see you're doing homework.

266
00:25:52,805 --> 00:25:56,388
Well, if l don't do it,
it seems no one else will.

267
00:25:57,601 --> 00:26:00,887
You'd have to be freaking cracked
to go there.

268
00:26:01,063 --> 00:26:03,304
You can't land in Colombia...

269
00:26:03,523 --> 00:26:06,892
...without a State Department
stamp on a passport.

270
00:26:07,068 --> 00:26:10,153
You can bet you were
on the restricted list...

271
00:26:10,322 --> 00:26:13,109
...five minutes after that bombing.

272
00:26:13,324 --> 00:26:16,942
Oh, yeah. Well, Panama.

273
00:26:17,245 --> 00:26:22,487
Back door into Colombia.
You have been doing some homework.

274
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,630
<i>Let's say you managed to get into
the country without getting killed...</i>

275
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:34,210
<i>...you'd need a pass to get
in the guerrilla zone.</i>

276
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:37,340
<i>They're sure not going
to give you one.</i>

277
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:40,515
Well, let's say l got one.

278
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:46,181
lt would take them about two seconds
to realize you're not Juan Valdez.

279
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:50,223
And they'd shove your head
up your ass...

280
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:53,016
...and bowl you off a cliff.

281
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,693
Are you going to help me or not?

282
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,365
Tell me your plan.

283
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:01,737
<i>I'll cross the border
through the Darién Gap.</i>

284
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:05,038
<i>I understand the jungle
is hard to patrol.</i>

285
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,161
<i>I can make it to Valencia
in one day.</i>

286
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,377
<i>Then it's 200 miles
to the guerrilla zone.</i>

287
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,757
<i>I can pay someone
to drive me to Mompós.</i>

288
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:20,130
<i>I don't think so. Go to the wrong
person, you're a dead man.</i>

289
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:25,221
<i>Next to drugs, kidnapping gringos
is the most profitable business.</i>

290
00:27:25,392 --> 00:27:29,437
<i>Get on a bus as fast as you can.</i>

291
00:27:30,773 --> 00:27:33,857
<i>-Mompós?
-Sí.</i>

292
00:27:37,362 --> 00:27:41,656
<i>If you make it to the bus,
you're doing all right.</i>

293
00:27:43,243 --> 00:27:47,821
-Thanks for your advice.
-lt's only good advice if you take it.

294
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:58,799
<i>-Qué pasa?
-Up ahead. Roadblock.</i>

295
00:27:58,966 --> 00:28:02,299
-Who are they looking for?
-Anyone not like them.

296
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:31,869
His passport was found in his backpack
when he escaped one of our roadblocks.

297
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:35,625
-He's committing suicide.
-Only two ways he can go:

298
00:31:35,796 --> 00:31:38,797
Upriver or on the road through Mompós.

299
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:42,632
lf we know he's here,
the guerrillas know.

300
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,265
Or they will soon.
l want you to make sure of it.

301
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:49,755
All right.

302
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:54,934
l give you 12 hours before we find
your fireman facedown in a pit.

303
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:59,975
Sure would show Washington
you can't negotiate with terrorists.

304
00:32:06,867 --> 00:32:09,702
Los Angeles was a great success.

305
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:14,158
Finally, the hypocrites want
to negotiate.

306
00:32:16,209 --> 00:32:19,874
Americans hide behind family values.
False ideals.

307
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:24,957
They've forgotten the reality of war.
Not like us.

308
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:29,710
They found his passport.
He's coming to Mompós.

309
00:32:31,974 --> 00:32:35,473
Excellent.
Take a fireman from Los Angeles.

310
00:32:36,145 --> 00:32:39,976
When America hears the story,
they cry rivers of tears.

311
00:32:40,816 --> 00:32:45,976
Capture him. We hold him
for ransom, and they will pay.

312
00:32:46,196 --> 00:32:50,988
Two teams. One at the harbor, one
in town. Find him. Bring him to me.

313
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:53,400
lf they don't pay...

314
00:32:53,703 --> 00:32:55,660
...we kill him.

315
00:33:10,927 --> 00:33:13,216
<i>All roads end in Mompós.</i>

316
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:18,424
<i>The only way into the guerrilla zone
from there is upriver.</i>

317
00:33:34,908 --> 00:33:37,364
How do l go upriver in that?

318
00:33:37,578 --> 00:33:41,445
No one goes upriver.
Not without a pass.

319
00:33:52,175 --> 00:33:54,926
<i>You said I need a pass to get in.</i>

320
00:33:55,511 --> 00:33:57,919
<i>Tell me how to get one.</i>

321
00:33:58,347 --> 00:34:01,597
<i>You may be able to buy
a pass from a local.</i>

322
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:04,845
<i>God help you if you ask the wrong one.</i>

323
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:11,771
<i>Look, this is where I pretty much
run out of good advice.</i>

324
00:34:12,569 --> 00:34:15,772
<i>Thanks. I'm going to figure it out.</i>

325
00:35:37,649 --> 00:35:39,606
What are you doing?

326
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:57,493
ls the boy okay?

327
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,877
Yes, he's okay.
But l don't need any help.

328
00:36:01,255 --> 00:36:04,172
l was just concerned about the boy.

329
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:10,084
Sorry. You are very kind.

330
00:36:10,597 --> 00:36:14,180
He gets so excited.
l have trouble keeping up.

331
00:36:14,351 --> 00:36:17,055
He couldn't wait to get
to the festival.

332
00:36:17,229 --> 00:36:20,146
This carnival, he loves.

333
00:36:20,648 --> 00:36:23,020
-l'm Selena.
-Gordy.

334
00:36:23,234 --> 00:36:25,227
This is my son, Mauro.

335
00:36:25,403 --> 00:36:27,063
Gordy.

336
00:36:28,072 --> 00:36:29,531
Friend.

337
00:36:37,915 --> 00:36:42,411
All right. Better get going.
Nice to meet you. Bye-bye.

338
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,459
Mr. Brewer.

339
00:36:45,922 --> 00:36:49,421
You have to come with me.
You're on my list.

340
00:36:50,176 --> 00:36:52,963
-What's this?
-You're here illegally.

341
00:36:53,471 --> 00:36:56,258
No, l'm not.
My passport was stolen.

342
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,758
See those guys over there?

343
00:36:59,977 --> 00:37:01,602
They're guerrillas!

344
00:37:39,681 --> 00:37:42,351
Hey, no, seriously, captain.

345
00:37:42,517 --> 00:37:46,978
l appreciate you guys taking me
without a reservation.

346
00:37:47,189 --> 00:37:49,514
l know how crowded it gets here.

347
00:37:51,651 --> 00:37:57,191
You know, l'd tip you, but your chief
took all my money already.

348
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:03,993
-You gave away my favorite cell.
-Put him next to the American.

349
00:38:04,205 --> 00:38:08,866
That's not nice. Why'd you do that?
Because he's bigger than l am?

350
00:38:09,043 --> 00:38:13,918
Why are you doing this to me?
l thought we had an understanding.

351
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:18,174
You're calling me a pervert?

352
00:38:18,385 --> 00:38:20,757
l like you too.

353
00:38:21,304 --> 00:38:25,966
Sean Armstrong. Public lewdness.
At least, that's what they call it.

354
00:38:26,142 --> 00:38:30,519
But l was just standing there.
She was doing all the work.

355
00:38:31,188 --> 00:38:36,064
Are you just quiet, or did somebody
confiscate your tongue?

356
00:38:43,492 --> 00:38:45,983
-Gordy Brewer.
-Do l know you?

357
00:38:46,286 --> 00:38:48,409
l doubt it.

358
00:38:48,622 --> 00:38:51,029
So, what are you innocent of, huh?

359
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:53,367
l'm an illegal alien.

360
00:38:53,585 --> 00:38:58,081
You goddamn gringos. You come
down here and steal all the jobs.

361
00:38:58,256 --> 00:39:02,467
Half the country wants to kidnap you.
Half wants to kill you.

362
00:39:02,635 --> 00:39:06,004
No one gives a shit
about us Canadians.

363
00:39:06,222 --> 00:39:10,349
Death squads kill guerrillas.
Guerrillas kill the military.

364
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,050
Peasants are killed by everybody.

365
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:17,439
But we Canadians,
flies on the wall.

366
00:39:18,608 --> 00:39:23,235
Hey, man. Don't even look at them
unless you can kill them.

367
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:28,233
-They're all guerrillas, aren't they?
-l did not say that.

368
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:30,906
That's what you meant.

369
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:34,613
You work the guerrilla zone.
That's how you know.

370
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:39,417
-Can l move to a different cell?
-Doing what?

371
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,965
l fix and sell heavy machinery.
You satisfied?

372
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,884
Sell me a pass
so l can work the zone.

373
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:50,468
Stick a sock in it.
l'm just a wrench for hire.

374
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,678
lf anyone found out what l do,
l'd be an organ donor.

375
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,057
My pass is not for sale.

376
00:39:57,437 --> 00:40:00,603
-Thanks a lot.
-Don't mention it.

377
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,485
Give me a list of everybody
they picked up.

378
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:10,859
<i>The guerrillas were after Brewer
when the policía showed up.</i>

379
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:13,822
Everyone we need in the same jail.

380
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,906
We should put this fireman
on the payroll.

381
00:40:17,122 --> 00:40:18,616
Seat belt.

382
00:41:07,336 --> 00:41:09,708
l think we got some company coming.

383
00:41:53,254 --> 00:41:56,706
<i>Mompós Jail is under attack
by guerrilla troops.</i>

384
00:41:56,883 --> 00:42:00,880
Get a team outside
and squads to clear the building.

385
00:42:01,095 --> 00:42:02,174
<i>Copy.</i>

386
00:42:02,346 --> 00:42:04,968
Goddamn it, l can't believe this shit!

387
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,640
What about the fireman?

388
00:43:41,857 --> 00:43:44,858
Claudio, they're coming!
We have to go!

389
00:43:45,152 --> 00:43:47,358
Let him burn in hell!

390
00:43:49,823 --> 00:43:54,817
Shit! We're gonna fry!
We're gonna fucking fry!

391
00:44:06,255 --> 00:44:10,881
That's using the old noggin!
That's using the noggin!

392
00:44:11,468 --> 00:44:13,544
Yeah! Fuck America!

393
00:44:13,762 --> 00:44:18,341
Good. That's good, baby. That's good!
Get me out of here!

394
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:30,521
<i>Let's play This Is Your Life.
l want your pass.</i>

395
00:44:30,695 --> 00:44:33,530
lt's my livelihood!
You'd let me die here?

396
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:37,073
l thought we were friends!
lt's my livelihood!

397
00:44:37,285 --> 00:44:39,194
You'd let me die here?

398
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:42,406
That's the last thing
that will happen.

399
00:44:42,581 --> 00:44:46,282
First, the air's gonna heat up
in here to 45 1 degrees.

400
00:44:46,502 --> 00:44:51,792
Your pass will explode, your socks will
ignite, your fingernails will melt.

401
00:44:52,007 --> 00:44:55,707
All right, all right!
Shit! Here you go!

402
00:44:55,885 --> 00:44:59,052
lt's yours, all right? Take it.

403
00:44:59,222 --> 00:45:03,171
Now get me out. Get me out
of here, please! Come on!

404
00:45:21,368 --> 00:45:26,113
<i>Witnesses heard prisoners call
for El Lobo. He was here, boss.</i>

405
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:29,740
He was into our hands
and they let him walk out?

406
00:45:29,918 --> 00:45:32,753
What good's a tower
if nobody's watching?

407
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,747
The fireman isn't here.

408
00:45:34,922 --> 00:45:38,256
No kidding.
The fireman escaped the fire?

409
00:45:42,263 --> 00:45:45,928
Look around. With any luck,
Gordy Brewer's dead.

410
00:45:57,694 --> 00:45:59,936
l'm sorry l had to scare you.

411
00:46:00,113 --> 00:46:03,612
Hey, l know when it's time to retire.

412
00:46:03,825 --> 00:46:06,316
You weren't gonna let me burn.

413
00:46:07,828 --> 00:46:09,904
What's this for?

414
00:46:10,122 --> 00:46:14,701
For your retirement fund.
And for additional information.

415
00:46:15,878 --> 00:46:17,954
Tell me what l need to know.

416
00:46:18,672 --> 00:46:20,961
Get back to the harbor.

417
00:46:21,133 --> 00:46:25,925
The guy who takes me upriver,
his name's Omar. He'll set you up.

418
00:46:26,137 --> 00:46:29,138
ln San Pablo,
ask for Felix Ramirez.

419
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:34,770
Say you're my replacement. Say that
l was arrested for something raunchy.

420
00:46:34,979 --> 00:46:38,264
Good luck. You'll need it.

421
00:47:08,678 --> 00:47:10,670
Who did this?

422
00:47:12,181 --> 00:47:17,175
The guerrillas. They think these
people help the paramilitaries.

423
00:47:56,014 --> 00:47:59,217
Put your hands up!
And hold up your pass!

424
00:48:22,581 --> 00:48:25,416
l replace Armstrong.

425
00:49:17,966 --> 00:49:21,216
-You are not Armstrong.
-That's for damn sure.

426
00:49:21,428 --> 00:49:22,970
Felix?

427
00:49:23,305 --> 00:49:25,878
Heinrich Beckmann, his replacement.

428
00:49:26,057 --> 00:49:30,304
Says you, buddy.
This is a serious breach of protocol.

429
00:49:30,478 --> 00:49:33,515
l put in the papers,
and this is what l get?

430
00:49:33,731 --> 00:49:35,807
lt's like ordering a pizza.

431
00:49:36,025 --> 00:49:39,311
Ask for Canadian bacon,
you get German sausage.

432
00:49:39,487 --> 00:49:44,149
lf you don't want me to fix
your engine, l'll go back home.

433
00:49:46,869 --> 00:49:50,202
Come on, come on.
Don't be such a sauerkraut.

434
00:49:50,414 --> 00:49:55,408
What happened to my man Armstrong?
Maybe you brained him for his pass.

435
00:49:55,585 --> 00:49:57,708
He was arrested yesterday.

436
00:49:57,879 --> 00:50:01,497
He was caught screwing
the police chief's daughter.

437
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:08,046
That's Armstrong.
Double-dipping whore. l love that guy.

438
00:50:08,848 --> 00:50:13,344
-l wish l were him.
-l still can't let him through, Felix.

439
00:50:19,733 --> 00:50:22,853
My generator isn't fixed,
l can't pay taxes.

440
00:50:23,028 --> 00:50:26,444
l can't pay,
your boss will make some cuts.

441
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:30,950
Now, it could be your salary,
and it could be your throat.

442
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:34,031
l'll let you marinate on that, okay?

443
00:50:39,961 --> 00:50:44,172
Bring him back here first thing
in the morning.

444
00:50:50,596 --> 00:50:51,758
<i>Danke.</i>

445
00:50:55,225 --> 00:50:56,933
Beckmann.

446
00:51:02,524 --> 00:51:04,267
Don't forget your pass.

447
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:23,746
Your English is good
for a German guy.

448
00:51:23,961 --> 00:51:27,080
Thanks. Where did you learn yours?

449
00:51:27,255 --> 00:51:31,335
Oh, man, l been to New York,
Chicago, Miami.

450
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:36,921
L.A. for a little bit. l want to go
back someday when l'm a big shot.

451
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:41,600
l can't be begging some corporate
asshole to put my CD on.

452
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:43,928
l want to cut an album, man.

453
00:51:44,105 --> 00:51:49,265
lt's kind of hardcore campesino rap.
Want to hear a little taste?

454
00:51:49,485 --> 00:51:50,943
lf l have to.

455
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:55,939
With that attitude, it won't be
a lot of fun. Here you go.

456
00:51:59,995 --> 00:52:02,236
<i>Guerrilla thrilla
Take me to Manila</i>

457
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:04,620
<i>What do we got?
Smooth like vanilla</i>

458
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:08,539
<i>Hottie, eenie-minie-mo
Tell the CIA to go</i>

459
00:52:08,711 --> 00:52:10,620
<i>They gotta get out, you know</i>

460
00:52:11,297 --> 00:52:15,460
-What do you think, man?
-Great. l think you'll be a winner.

461
00:52:15,634 --> 00:52:18,968
-You serious?
-You're in the wrong profession.

462
00:52:19,138 --> 00:52:23,135
l can't believe this.
That's exactly how l feel.

463
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:29,721
-All right, here. Put this on.
-What's this for?

464
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:34,815
For your protection. You don't wanna
know how to get where we're going.

465
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:37,655
lt won't be more than 15 minutes.

466
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,794
Okay, we're here, baby.
Don't get funky on me.

467
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,886
Peekaboo.

468
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:17,685
So, what do you think?
Pretty snazzy, right?

469
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,944
-Where are we?
-My place.

470
00:53:26,201 --> 00:53:30,033
-lt smells here.
-Profits, baby, profits.

471
00:53:30,205 --> 00:53:32,660
-This is a cocaine plant.
-l know.

472
00:53:32,874 --> 00:53:37,536
Just because l'm brown and down
doesn't mean l work for minimum wage.

473
00:53:37,712 --> 00:53:41,412
lf l don't do it, Bolivia will.
They don't, China will.

474
00:53:41,591 --> 00:53:46,466
lf China don't, America will do it.
Actually, they are doing it.

475
00:53:46,679 --> 00:53:50,807
Jesus! l want to put you
in my next video.

476
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,514
lt's the diesel generator.
l should let it cool down...

477
00:53:55,729 --> 00:54:00,058
...but it's drugonomics.
l can't crank it out fast enough.

478
00:54:00,233 --> 00:54:03,898
The Silicon Valley geeks
must e-mail it to each other.

479
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:05,897
-That the one?
-Yeah.

480
00:54:06,072 --> 00:54:09,192
Armstrong was a magician with that.

481
00:54:09,409 --> 00:54:12,694
-Don't worry. l'll make it work.
-Let's hope so.

482
00:55:05,497 --> 00:55:09,115
He told me his name was
Heinrich Beckmann.

483
00:55:09,626 --> 00:55:11,702
Heinrich Beckmann?

484
00:55:12,545 --> 00:55:16,460
He had a hat on.
l didn't recognize him.

485
00:55:17,842 --> 00:55:20,333
l made a mistake.

486
00:55:29,687 --> 00:55:33,055
No! Please, Claudio!
Listen to me, please!

487
00:55:33,524 --> 00:55:35,350
Claudio!

488
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:39,102
ln the struggle for liberation...

489
00:55:39,279 --> 00:55:43,027
...there is no room for mistakes.

490
00:55:59,798 --> 00:56:01,672
Discipline is everything.

491
00:56:01,884 --> 00:56:05,632
Discipline and punishment.

492
00:56:42,631 --> 00:56:46,082
Find him. And no mistakes.

493
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:56,110
Come here whenever they want
and barge in. l'm not a puppet.

494
00:57:59,787 --> 00:58:03,831
-Thought l was paid up for the month.
-Where's the mechanic?

495
00:58:04,208 --> 00:58:07,327
Calm down, dog.
You losing faith in me, man?

496
00:58:09,463 --> 00:58:11,788
l got everything under control.

497
00:58:12,007 --> 00:58:16,882
l got him working his ass off.
Germans are like cyborgs.

498
00:58:17,053 --> 00:58:19,461
You seem tense. Need some R and R?

499
00:58:20,974 --> 00:58:23,808
You got pull,
you can get a new generator.

500
00:58:23,976 --> 00:58:26,847
Heinrich, l got some friends for you.

501
00:58:31,025 --> 00:58:35,069
My bad. l said if he fixed
that gasket, he could take five.

502
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:37,651
He's probably in the latrine.

503
00:58:37,864 --> 00:58:41,031
He's probably buffing the helmet.

504
00:58:41,576 --> 00:58:45,360
Besides, he can't blend in.
He's this big Neanderthal...

505
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:49,029
We'll get some rum,
we'll hang out...

506
00:58:50,001 --> 00:58:52,574
What the hell was that?!

507
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:57,623
<i>Get the mangueras! Get the pumps!
Save the kilos, come on!</i>

508
00:59:13,231 --> 00:59:17,395
l'll work it out. l'll cut my losses,
pay whatever it takes.

509
00:59:17,569 --> 00:59:21,613
l'll pay you three times the amount.
l'll work it out.

510
01:03:34,979 --> 01:03:37,932
No! Stay back there!

511
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:39,773
Stop! Stay back!

512
01:03:39,942 --> 01:03:41,021
Claudio!

513
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:43,145
No! Stop!

514
01:05:11,695 --> 01:05:13,070
Rest now.

515
01:05:19,077 --> 01:05:20,405
Who are you?

516
01:05:21,579 --> 01:05:23,905
l'm his wife.

517
01:05:32,923 --> 01:05:35,082
Get out.

518
01:05:48,939 --> 01:05:51,015
The fireman, huh?

519
01:05:51,733 --> 01:05:55,268
The coward who kills women
and children.

520
01:05:57,947 --> 01:06:01,530
You Americans are so naive.

521
01:06:01,742 --> 01:06:05,954
You see a peasant with a gun
on the news, you change channels.

522
01:06:06,455 --> 01:06:12,707
But you never ask,
"Why does a peasant need a gun?"

523
01:06:13,504 --> 01:06:18,794
Why? You think you're the only ones
who can fight for independence.

524
01:06:18,967 --> 01:06:23,463
lndependence to do what?
To kill my wife and my son?

525
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:38,850
l remember your face from Los Angeles.

526
01:06:40,571 --> 01:06:44,485
That was the face of a man
who saved lives.

527
01:06:44,658 --> 01:06:47,991
Well, your face has changed.

528
01:06:48,203 --> 01:06:52,153
You think your wife and son
would recognize you now?

529
01:06:52,374 --> 01:06:54,662
l remember your face too.

530
01:06:56,961 --> 01:06:58,954
The smile...

531
01:07:00,506 --> 01:07:03,293
...just before you killed them.

532
01:07:04,844 --> 01:07:07,335
You're gonna pay for that.

533
01:07:08,514 --> 01:07:11,005
You're gonna pay for that.

534
01:07:12,392 --> 01:07:17,387
Well, it seems we're both
willing to kill for a cause...

535
01:07:17,606 --> 01:07:21,188
...so,what's the difference
between you and l?

536
01:07:24,696 --> 01:07:27,103
The difference is...

537
01:07:27,991 --> 01:07:30,232
...l'm just gonna kill you.

538
01:07:51,763 --> 01:07:53,387
Estaban!

539
01:07:55,934 --> 01:07:57,214
Estaban!

540
01:08:48,525 --> 01:08:52,439
-Why do you want him alive?
-He saved my life and Mauro's.

541
01:08:52,654 --> 01:08:54,646
What is the purpose?

542
01:08:55,115 --> 01:08:59,444
He's the enemy. lf they don't pay
tomorrow, l'll kill him.

543
01:08:59,661 --> 01:09:03,160
-Claudio, don't do this.
-Don't argue with me.

544
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:08,248
-lt's not the right way!
-Don't tell me what to do! Come back!

545
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:20,211
This is a satellite photo
of San Pablo last night.

546
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:25,507
We got a large heat-and-light anomaly
consistent with an explosion.

547
01:09:25,727 --> 01:09:30,389
Two minutes later, building blows up.
We got guerrillas, some down.

548
01:09:30,606 --> 01:09:35,517
We have a big man down on the street,
a woman and child.

549
01:09:35,736 --> 01:09:38,488
-And this guy.
-This guy gives the orders.

550
01:09:38,948 --> 01:09:42,862
l can't believe it.
Brewer found the son of a bitch.

551
01:09:43,035 --> 01:09:47,115
A little later, an ALC convoy arrives.
Everyone loads up.

552
01:09:47,331 --> 01:09:50,166
They travel upriver and stop here.

553
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:51,709
An ALC base camp.

554
01:09:52,169 --> 01:09:57,329
We'll insert a platoon here.
Use air support to box in the rear.

555
01:09:57,841 --> 01:10:01,423
We'll come in through the treetops.
Only 20 minutes.

556
01:10:01,636 --> 01:10:03,296
Washington will know.

557
01:10:03,513 --> 01:10:08,673
We got a wounded American being
tortured. This is a rescue mission.

558
01:10:09,685 --> 01:10:12,520
-We go in at dawn.
-Roger that.

559
01:10:43,342 --> 01:10:45,963
Why are you taking care of me?

560
01:10:47,471 --> 01:10:49,759
Because you saved my son.

561
01:10:50,432 --> 01:10:52,887
And your husband killed mine.

562
01:10:59,065 --> 01:11:03,063
When l first met Claudio,
he was a teacher.

563
01:11:03,778 --> 01:11:05,605
lt was in Guatemala.

564
01:11:06,781 --> 01:11:10,031
Sophia, our daughter, was born there.

565
01:11:11,702 --> 01:11:16,909
The guerrillas were all around us,
but they left us alone.

566
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:21,914
One night, soldiers came
to our village.

567
01:11:22,921 --> 01:11:25,590
They were led by American advisers.

568
01:11:26,257 --> 01:11:30,089
We crawled into the fields,
but they threw grenades.

569
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:34,632
Sophia, our baby girl...

570
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:36,885
...she was hit.

571
01:11:38,144 --> 01:11:41,595
She bled to death in Claudio's arms.

572
01:11:44,191 --> 01:11:48,402
Mauro was orphaned that night,
so l took him in.

573
01:11:53,658 --> 01:11:56,280
Claudio joined the guerrillas.

574
01:11:57,495 --> 01:12:02,323
And now he's a man consumed by hate
and driven by rage.

575
01:12:04,335 --> 01:12:05,829
Just like you.

576
01:12:07,797 --> 01:12:09,505
l'm not like him.

577
01:12:10,257 --> 01:12:12,333
Not yet.

578
01:12:12,551 --> 01:12:18,305
What about you? lf you keep working
with him, you are no better than him.

579
01:12:18,515 --> 01:12:22,928
-What would you have me do?
-Help me stop him.

580
01:12:26,982 --> 01:12:28,641
lt's too late.

581
01:13:46,473 --> 01:13:48,513
l'm trusting you with my life.

582
01:13:50,769 --> 01:13:52,228
And my son's.

583
01:13:53,563 --> 01:13:54,974
What are you saying?

584
01:13:55,148 --> 01:13:58,184
Claudio went to Washington
to plant a bomb.

585
01:13:59,361 --> 01:14:02,361
l can't be a part of it anymore.

586
01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:05,697
They'll protect us, won't they?

587
01:14:07,243 --> 01:14:09,615
lf they won't, l will.

588
01:14:54,663 --> 01:14:56,038
Now!

589
01:15:00,377 --> 01:15:01,408
Let's go.

590
01:15:07,425 --> 01:15:09,501
Son of a bitch.

591
01:15:12,304 --> 01:15:14,546
<i>Eighth squad's on the way down.</i>

592
01:15:14,765 --> 01:15:16,140
Come on.

593
01:15:16,308 --> 01:15:17,802
<i>Hold your hover.</i>

594
01:15:17,976 --> 01:15:20,016
<i>Insertion's under way.</i>

595
01:15:26,026 --> 01:15:27,734
Let her go!

596
01:15:39,664 --> 01:15:42,155
<i>Target out. Setting her up.</i>

597
01:15:43,292 --> 01:15:47,290
We have to go upriver.
There's a minefield over there.

598
01:15:53,093 --> 01:15:55,584
Keep firing! Kill them all!

599
01:15:57,681 --> 01:16:00,551
-Stay low.
-We're trapped.

600
01:16:45,059 --> 01:16:47,550
<i>Got them in the clearing.
Firing away.</i>

601
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:51,097
<i>-Copy that.
-It's confirmed. LZ is secure.</i>

602
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:02,609
Let's go.

603
01:17:32,687 --> 01:17:34,893
Looks like an officer.

604
01:18:27,364 --> 01:18:29,191
Get down!

605
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:33,986
Keep your eyes open!

606
01:18:41,669 --> 01:18:43,662
Stand down!

607
01:18:44,213 --> 01:18:49,338
What we've got here
is a great American.

608
01:18:52,763 --> 01:18:57,840
Goddamn you, Brandt. l was your excuse
to kill all these people.

609
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:02,520
You're here to murder a man, right?
l'm trying to save a country.

610
01:19:03,106 --> 01:19:06,689
-Keep poison off our streets.
-By killing innocents?

611
01:19:06,901 --> 01:19:09,190
l fight terrorists with terror.

612
01:19:09,362 --> 01:19:12,197
What terrorists?
The Wolf isn't even here!

613
01:19:12,406 --> 01:19:16,024
He's gone to Washington
to blow up another building!

614
01:19:18,913 --> 01:19:20,572
What do you mean? Where?

615
01:19:20,748 --> 01:19:25,077
l'll tell you as soon as
l'm on a jet heading home.

616
01:19:25,419 --> 01:19:29,796
And they'll come with us,
because this is his wife and his son.

617
01:19:30,257 --> 01:19:34,301
She's the only one
that can identify the target.

618
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:05,738
l appreciate it. Thank you.

619
01:20:08,042 --> 01:20:11,292
Mr. Secretary, this just came in.

620
01:20:11,504 --> 01:20:15,964
All right, NSA, ClA, Southern
Command, they're at your disposal.

621
01:20:16,175 --> 01:20:20,338
Washington Surveillance Command
will assist with our search.

622
01:20:20,554 --> 01:20:22,630
Stay on station. Be ready.

623
01:20:22,848 --> 01:20:25,802
We got an audio-encoded e-mail.
Authentic.

624
01:20:26,018 --> 01:20:27,595
Run it.

625
01:20:30,939 --> 01:20:33,477
<i>My last warning went unheard.</i>

626
01:20:34,317 --> 01:20:38,646
<i>The American people will pay
for this mistake in blood.</i>

627
01:20:38,863 --> 01:20:42,695
<i>A bomb has been placed
in your capital city.</i>

628
01:20:42,909 --> 01:20:48,033
<i>By the time you hear this message,
it will be too late for you to find it.</i>

629
01:20:48,247 --> 01:20:51,414
<i>And many of your citizens will die.</i>

630
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:56,702
<i>Their needless sacrifice is the price
of your ignorance.</i>

631
01:20:57,381 --> 01:21:00,334
<i>There will be no mercy.</i>

632
01:21:00,634 --> 01:21:03,551
<i>There's no place you can hide.</i>

633
01:21:03,762 --> 01:21:07,380
<i>We'll continue to strike
until the American public...</i>

634
01:21:07,557 --> 01:21:10,392
<i>...finally realizes
this war's price...</i>

635
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,596
<i>...is one they cannot afford.</i>

636
01:21:13,813 --> 01:21:16,814
<i>Get out of Colombia now.</i>

637
01:21:17,066 --> 01:21:19,023
Sangre o libertad.

638
01:21:46,052 --> 01:21:49,385
Good to see you with all
your fingers and toes.

639
01:21:49,597 --> 01:21:51,340
This is Selena Perrini.

640
01:21:51,515 --> 01:21:55,513
-Agent Phipps. This is Agent Dray.
-How do you do?

641
01:21:55,686 --> 01:21:58,093
-We'd like to get started.
-Sit.

642
01:21:58,563 --> 01:21:59,726
Good luck.

643
01:22:02,901 --> 01:22:05,688
-Something to drink?
-Water, please.

644
01:22:05,862 --> 01:22:08,435
All right, David, let's get ready.

645
01:22:09,115 --> 01:22:13,991
We've assembled pictures of buildings
with columns as you've described.

646
01:22:14,203 --> 01:22:15,863
We'll go through them.

647
01:22:16,038 --> 01:22:20,783
lf you see anything familiar, please
give us a nod. Here we go, David.

648
01:22:35,765 --> 01:22:41,139
These are photos of this building from
different angles. Here's the façade.

649
01:22:42,522 --> 01:22:45,937
Did he describe any activity
in this building?

650
01:22:46,150 --> 01:22:49,601
-No, he didn't discuss anything.
-Ms. Perrini.

651
01:22:49,779 --> 01:22:52,732
This is the same building,
different angles.

652
01:22:52,907 --> 01:22:56,358
-Can you zoom in on that?
-l can't tell.

653
01:22:56,577 --> 01:22:59,780
-Take a look at this entrance.
-That's not it.

654
01:22:59,997 --> 01:23:02,036
Can you zoom in on that?

655
01:23:02,249 --> 01:23:05,499
-How about this one?
-No, that's not it.

656
01:23:10,215 --> 01:23:12,752
Does this look at all familiar?

657
01:23:12,925 --> 01:23:14,717
-Keep going.
-l don't know.

658
01:23:14,886 --> 01:23:18,337
You two make quite a team.
Fireman and the refugee.

659
01:23:18,597 --> 01:23:20,923
Sounds like a TV show.

660
01:23:23,018 --> 01:23:25,307
And you could play the asshole.

661
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:07,684
All right.
We're gonna let everybody know.

662
01:24:07,852 --> 01:24:11,102
Secretary Ramsey's coming over.

663
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:16,144
Wait. Go back. Go back. There.

664
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:17,938
-This one.
-That one?

665
01:24:18,154 --> 01:24:20,395
-Familiar?
-lt's this picture.

666
01:24:20,614 --> 01:24:23,319
Union Station. You got that?

667
01:24:23,826 --> 01:24:26,661
-Yes.
-Here's another shot of it.

668
01:24:27,162 --> 01:24:28,277
ls that it?

669
01:24:28,497 --> 01:24:31,166
Go back two and zoom in
on the entrance.

670
01:24:31,375 --> 01:24:34,411
Look at this one,
here's the entrance.

671
01:24:36,504 --> 01:24:37,999
My God, l think so.

672
01:24:38,173 --> 01:24:43,843
Eyeball footage from every station's
camera in the last 24 hours.

673
01:24:44,137 --> 01:24:47,137
David, let's go back on that, please.

674
01:24:54,104 --> 01:24:56,856
Let's go! Go, go, go! Pick it up!

675
01:25:32,891 --> 01:25:34,266
Don't get up.

676
01:25:34,476 --> 01:25:37,393
Selena, Secretary of State
Barbara Ramsey.

677
01:25:37,562 --> 01:25:41,227
We understand the sacrifice
you're making here.

678
01:25:41,399 --> 01:25:42,562
Thank you.

679
01:25:43,401 --> 01:25:45,808
-The fireman's over here.
-Peter!

680
01:25:46,028 --> 01:25:49,896
Madam Secretary, sir,
l think we got something.

681
01:25:50,116 --> 01:25:52,607
Dave, the file's in your active bin.

682
01:25:52,785 --> 01:25:57,281
lt was taken off one of the Union
Station monitors 13 minutes ago.

683
01:25:57,456 --> 01:25:59,579
-What is it?
-First photograph:

684
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:02,371
Man behind the trees
with a briefcase.

685
01:26:02,544 --> 01:26:06,411
Second photo: goes behind
the trees, briefcase is gone.

686
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:08,416
Punch in on that.

687
01:26:11,511 --> 01:26:13,753
On the face.

688
01:26:19,227 --> 01:26:20,851
Yeah, that's him.

689
01:26:21,312 --> 01:26:24,763
Tell our team the location
of that camera.

690
01:26:25,441 --> 01:26:27,267
lt's almost rush hour.

691
01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:04,008
Good afternoon, this is Shrub.
Yeah, very urgent.

692
01:27:04,770 --> 01:27:07,806
Thank you. He's coming on line.

693
01:27:09,482 --> 01:27:12,649
Yes, we've identified the target.

694
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:15,822
l'll be leaving shortly.

695
01:27:24,497 --> 01:27:26,489
l saw him over there.

696
01:27:40,178 --> 01:27:42,716
No media statement at all.

697
01:27:44,432 --> 01:27:46,638
l'll cover here.

698
01:28:02,616 --> 01:28:05,189
You did the right thing.

699
01:28:10,206 --> 01:28:12,697
-l hope so.
-No, l'm sure of it.

700
01:28:12,876 --> 01:28:16,458
Look, it's something you had to do.

701
01:28:20,424 --> 01:28:24,208
Right now, l don't feel very good
about anything.

702
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:28,217
l'm sorry about that.

703
01:28:29,141 --> 01:28:33,221
Look, everything will be all right.

704
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:49,239
Excuse me.
Can you show me to the restroom?

705
01:28:49,702 --> 01:28:52,371
Sure. Follow me.

706
01:28:57,042 --> 01:28:58,453
Are you all right?

707
01:29:16,603 --> 01:29:19,272
He's gonna be fine with me.

708
01:29:24,485 --> 01:29:26,524
Why don't you go ahead?

709
01:30:09,444 --> 01:30:13,940
Mr. Brewer, l just want to express
to you my sympathy.

710
01:30:14,157 --> 01:30:18,154
<i>As long as America continues
its aggression in Colombia...</i>

711
01:30:18,369 --> 01:30:20,907
<i>... we will bring the war home to you.</i>

712
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:24,449
<i>And you will not feel safe
in your own beds.</i>

713
01:30:24,667 --> 01:30:27,336
<i>Colombia is not your country.</i>

714
01:30:27,503 --> 01:30:31,203
<i>Get out now. Sangre o libertad.</i>

715
01:30:33,342 --> 01:30:36,093
Sangre o libertad.

716
01:30:37,512 --> 01:30:39,754
Oh, my God.

717
01:30:45,478 --> 01:30:47,684
Where's he going?

718
01:30:59,742 --> 01:31:02,067
Don't open it!

719
01:31:08,041 --> 01:31:11,244
You should wipe your nose off
with that.

720
01:31:54,502 --> 01:31:56,874
Selena!

721
01:32:07,514 --> 01:32:08,925

Everybody, clear out the room!
There's a bomb in here!

727
01:32:57,853 --> 01:33:00,095
Give me the toy. Under the table.

728
01:33:00,272 --> 01:33:02,810
-What are you doing?
-There's a bomb!

729
01:33:03,150 --> 01:33:06,483
Get back! Get back! Get back!

730
01:33:43,021 --> 01:33:47,517
-Get the secretary out of here!
-Close it down!

731
01:33:47,692 --> 01:33:50,977
-Take care of the boy, okay?
-l will.

732

lt's never over.

741

So when are you going to kill me?

742
01:42:07,164 --> 01:42:09,204
Now!

743
01:43:31,911 --> 01:43:35,114

-Right here, sir.
