1
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,900
Scream more,

2
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,500
No matter how many patients
will escape from this hospital,

3
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,700
just because you're screaming,
I'll merge their bill in your account.

4
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,700
This is Dr. Ghunghroo.

5
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,800
A huge hospital belongs to him, But
still today he can't cure of his neck.

6
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,100
Exactly,
It is his sickness,

7
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,100
Automatically his neck's turning
around, like it changes its meaning.

8
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,800
Look at this,

9
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,600
Good Morning, Sir!
Good Morning,

10
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,300
I came here for your personal
secretary' job.

11
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,700
Bastard!

12
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,100
She is such a strange and
stupid girl.

13
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,400
Not stupid, she is a decent girl.

14
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,900
Ghunghroo, Whenever some
girl slaps you, then you must

15
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,400
she belongs to a good and
decent family.

16
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Shall we go, now!

17
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,400
Dr. Ghunghroo is going to meet a
girl for his nephew name Rajeev.

18
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,900
Even, until today he rejects more
then 500 proposals,

19
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,500
Because he's looking for a nice
and decent family.

20
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,900
And how much that family is decent,

21
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,300
He have his own style to know
this truth.

22
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,900
Look, It doesn't matter that
you want to be our relatives but...

23
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,700
I can't deceive a good people
like you,

24
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,500
Actually, I am a doctor but I'm
involved in bad business too, and

25
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,300
my nephew is such a bad guy.

26
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,900
Drinking, Gambling, Racing, Drugs,
Truly we're not able for your family.

27
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,100
Are you shocked?

28
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,000
Just to show you some decency,
I wear a Jodhpuri coat,

29
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,200
I can't breathe just because
of this coat.

30
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,000
And what you talking about
bad business,

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,500
We had done more than enough.

32
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,700
There is not another bad guy
better than us.

33
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,000
Amazing, Pandit Jee.
That is not enough.

34
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,800
My father is in jail since
last 5-6 years.

35
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,100
That Minister's son,
What's his name?

36
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,800
Whatever, He supplied him drugs.

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,500
Mr. Harilal, you recognize us
very fine.

38
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,100
Wow,
It's a real talk, Tell him.

39
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Amazing, Pandit Jee.
You found us a good family.

40
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,400
And if you're talking about parties,
My girl is always on Page 3.

41
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,400
I like that.

42
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,000
Nowadays, It is the culture.
Mr. Ghunghroo.

43
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,800
If some girl don't have a boyfriend,
then people don't call her HOT.

44
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,000
You're right, but she doesn't look
HOT.

45
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,200
Don't Insult me like this Uncle Jee,
You wanna see?

46
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
See!

47
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,500
Did you see?
She is hot, isn't it?

48
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,300
Mother!

49
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,500
Why you slap the pandit?
Because we that family which...

50
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,300
members haven't seen prison
nor a police station's face.

51
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,700
He needs a family who didn't have a
single black spot on their character.

52
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,500
That's why his nephew (Rajeev)
Is still virgin.

53
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,700
OK, OK.
Try it again, Try it.

54
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,200
Very nice, baby.
Very nice.

55
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,600
You did well,
I was trying since last 2 hours.

56
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,200
And you done in 2 minutes.

57
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,800
A girl who marry with him, She
will live a happily married life.

58
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,000
He's roaming to carrying a bat,
But he didn't find a baller yet.

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,300
He found a lot of ballers,
But his Uncle Dr. Ghunghroo...

60
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,400
He's such a strange empire,
Every ball is no ball, dead ball...

61
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,600
Why you're embarrassing Rajeev?

62
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,900
Come over here,
It's time to cut a cake.

63
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,100
Come on.
Lets go, Lets go.

64
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,300
Son, This rocket isn't straight,
It could enter anywhere,

65
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,900
Let it fly straight,
Uncle, It's my rocket,

66
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,100
If I will fly it curve shape,
then it will fly straight.

67
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,800
Look, If you will keep it straight,
It will go straight,

68
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,500
All right, Keep fixing them.
Get back Gopi.

69
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,700
Uncle!

70
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,100
Uncle, What you've done?
You burn them all.

71
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
Save her,

72
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,300
What happened?
Somebody is inside?

73
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,300
Our friend, Sanjana,
Please help her.

74
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,600
Uncle, you go inside, It's
happening because of you.

75
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,900
I am going,
I am going,

76
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,600
It's too late,
Why she didn't come yet?

77
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Sanjana, what happen?

78
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,800
Poor guy,
Come on, Lets go.

79
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,900
Why so much smile on uncle face?

80
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,900
What happened inside?

81
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,600
Fire!

82
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
What?
Fire! Fire!

83
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,200
Come Aunt!

84
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,900
I'm watching you since two days
you are thinking of that girl.

85
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,900
You are in love.

86
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,500
Yes!

87
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,700
I feel first time in my life
when I saw a girl that

88
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,700
she just made for me.

89
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,600
When I close my eyes,
I only see her,

90
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,300
When I open them,
I only see her,

91
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,100
I feel, I just thinking about her.

92
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,100
Aunt, Just prey for me, that
I meet her again, just once.

93
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,100
She will definitely meet you,

94
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,200
But we have to prey that her
family don't have a black spot.

95
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,700
Bhai, everything is clear,
Just come.

96
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
This is Uday Shetty,

97
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,700
Brother of Sanjana,

98
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,100
He wants to be an Actor,
But he became a Gangster.

99
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,700
But when he saw in the mirror
His inside actor woke up.

100
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,300
He have only one dream.

101
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,100
His sister should marry in a
decent family.

102
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,800
But why any decent girl
would marry a Don's sister?

103
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,700
That's why to talk with decent
people, He have his own style,

104
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,100
Look, We have everything,
A god has given us.

105
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,900
We have money, fame,
and respect.

106
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,400
I have a kind of respect, If I
wants to relate any family who

107
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,200
could not deny me.

108
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,800
I need only a good family,
I need a decent guy.

109
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,300
But Pandit Jee couldn't tell us
about your business briefly.

110
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,400
You didn't tell them about business.

111
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,500
What should I?
Sanjana Airbase?

112
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,200
Yes! Yes! Sanjana Airlines,
Sanjana Textiles,

113
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,500
Sanjana Textiles,
We have a large business.

114
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,100
It's establish, now it's
all running on phone.

115
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,100
Sir!
I bring you a very good news.

116
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,300
Not a single but two news, If you

117
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,500
Sir, It a very big good news.

118
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,000
Your only one phone call works,

119
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That Dhansukh's murder case
was running on you, that's finish.

120
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,600
Witness knows that, If he will
give vouch against you then

121
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,100
you will finish his entire family.

122
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,700
And builder took his
police complain back.

123
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,700
He wants settlement.

124
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:15,200
He gave 2 crores and he will pay
you remaining 3 crores in court.

125
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,600
Who were those people?
Who walk away.

126
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,900
Go and ask them,

127
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,800
They bring the proposal for
Sanjana,

128
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,900
But where they came from?

129
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,200
We call them from Mumbai,
Also force you lie them.

130
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,600
Now which decent family
remains in this city...

131
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,700
...who beg us to deny,
Sorry! Sorry! Sir,

132
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,700
I was in excitement...
What you mean excitement?

133
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,200
Where I am sited? From whom
I'm talking to? What I'm talking?

134
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,700
Don't understand...
Control, Control Uday.

135
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,900
Hey Ballu, tell him, What I do
when I get angered,

136
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,000
My one leg is fake, I was the
great player of hockey, Uday

137
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,500
Bhai get angered on me, then he
broke my leg with my hockey,

138
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,800

141
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:28,400
I thought if I gave you two news
then you will appreciate me,

142
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,800
Sir, Please forgive me,
Control, Control.

143
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
Hey! Stop,

144
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,400
Come outside,
What happen?

145
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Nobody will move,

146
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,100
Come outside,

147
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,500
Freeze! Freeze!

148
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,500
Nobody will move from his side,
Freeze!

149
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,800
Brother! What's going on?
Don't you see Brother is making

150
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,900
a picture,
Bhai?

151
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,100
Is this the way to make painting?
Who's your mad Bhai?

152
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,000
He's the Majnu Bhai!
Who Majnu? He's a Don.

153
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,700
You are so lucky,

154
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,700
If I carry a brush some day,
Didn't carry a gun,

155
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,600
Otherwise you should dead,
I was saying that...

156
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,700
You don't need to make this
accident. Even painting is a

157
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,100
work of Imagination.
They must be a stupid Painters,

158
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,500
I am painting directly, live.

159
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,400
If you call it in English,
Live Painting,

160
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,500
Last week, He was asking to
people on the bridge that

161
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
did they know how to swim,
Whoever say Yes, he threw

162
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,000
him from the bridge,

163
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,400
He wants to make painting a
swimming man.

164
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,000
Hey, Don't count,
Otherwise It will be less,

165
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,700
If you didn't make it well then
your family member would cry,

166
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,700
He don't have a family.

167
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,800
He didn't marry yet,

168
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,400
Is he wants to marry or not?

169
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,100
This is limit, He turns decent
people into cartoon,

170
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,600
Don't move,
I am slipping,

171
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,800
Sleeping?
Not sleeping, I am slipping,

172
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,500
I need a Kundli of decent guy,
immediately,

173
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,300
Sir! Please,
Please forgive me, now.

174
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,300
I can't run anymore,

175
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,300
Uday Bhai, I am calling you
from a long time, and

176
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,300
You turn Umbani off,

177
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,600
Today, I finish F.M. Hussain's game,

178
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,100
What?
Bhai! Look at there,

179
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,800
I think, India's party has also gone,

180
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,400
Bhai!
Yes!

181
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,000
May I ask you a question?
Go on,

182
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,300
Sanjana is your real sister?
More than real,

183
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,700
Yes, but,
Is she real?

184
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,700
I'm so black and she's white,
That's why you're asking,

185
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,100
Shankar Shetty married twice,
My father (Shankar Shetty).

186
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,500
Yes He married two times,
But...

187
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,300
our sanjana's can't marry once,
What do you mean once?

188
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,400
We wants to marry her once,
But that's not happening,

189
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,500
But It would happen now,

190
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,000
Your problem's solve in that
painting of mine,

191
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,400
Do you see that guy?
Where is the guy?

192
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,800
That guy sits on the bonnet,

193
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
Where is the bonnet?

194
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,100
Under the guy,

195
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,500
Yes!
He is such a decent guy,

196
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,800
These decent guys are so bad,
They don't understand decency,

197
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,400
For that reason,
I'll solve this matter by myself,

198
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,600
I'll get his Kundli tomorrow and
I'll talk to his family in my style,

199
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,900
And you don't interfere,
Then marriage must happen, Go.

200
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,500
Since you start the boutique, you
didn't show me the accounts,

201
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,900
I'm going to beauty parlour,

202
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:38,200
Go, when I'm talking about account,
you start missing your parlour,

203
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,300
Waste my money,

204
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,300
Hello!
Ghunghroo, how's your work?

205
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,600
Business is going well and there
is raining of money,

206
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,600
And you don't want to fall
some drops on us,

207
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,500
I need 4 khokha (crores)

208
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:00,300
Listen, this is boutique and we
sell ladies dresses not khokha,

209
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,700
You idiot,
Khokha means Crore,

210
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,000
Oh! Crore and you want 4,

211
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,200
Did your father left them here
or your Mother?

212
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,700
Heh! Diwali's cracker,
I'll burn you up now,

213
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,100
Do you know, who you are
talking to? Majnu Bhai,

214
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,500
Have you heard my name?
Sure, you told me twice,

215
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,100
Majnu Bhai speaking,
Majnu Bhai,

216
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,900
What should I do?
Are you insane?

217
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,400
I think, I have to finish you,
I'm asking you extortion money,

218
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,800
In English,
Protection money,

219
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,100
Oh!
So you need protection?

220
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,100
Do one thing, you bring me 4 crore
and I'll give you protection,

221
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,800
And if you want 4 shoes to eat
then call me again,

222
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,800
If I didn't turn you Laila from Majnu
then I'm not Ghunghroo anymore,

223
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Put the phone down,
He's abusing me,

224
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,500
Hey! Come outside,
Shop is closed from today,

225
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,000
Get away,
What's going on?

226
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,000
You will turn our Majnu Bhai
into Laila,

227
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,700
Get Ghaghra from there,

228
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,100
Now you looks like Laila,
Black, Blue, Yellow,

229
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,600
Take him,
Majnu Bhai, Majnu Bhai,

230
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,400
It was a mistake, I thought
someone's making me fool,

231
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,800
If I knew that you're on phone,
Should I say that?

232
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,900
Then what would you say?

233
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,000
What's this?
What do you think, who am I?

234
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,400
Bhai! You are all right,
It's my problem,

235
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,900
It's not just yours, Lot of
people have this problem,

236
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:12,000
Also the quantity of people like
you is going much more,

237
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,100

All right, All right,

242
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,400
It's good that Bhai didn't eat
breakfast on the way,

243
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,300
Otherwise they must be 6 Crores,
They will be 6 Crores,

244
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,200
If you didn't send me 5 crores before

248
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,000
and if you cut them from centre,
they will be six,

249
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:10,300
Another murder for the reason,
of non-payment of extortion money,

250
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,500

You wants to kill me?

265
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,400
He should give you something,

266

I don't want it,

Our wives are ran away, He

274
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,100

Is he doing Salaam,
or selling salaam?

285
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,600
He's the watchman of Bhai,
He didn't salam to Bhai once,

286
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,300
Bhai punished him to say salaam
everybody for six months,

287
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:55,800
It's a private jail of Bhai,
And they all are prisoners,

288
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,700
What about him?

I have to problem to fill air.

290
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,000
Gave him a work to fill
balloons on next birthday.

291
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,900
What will happen to him?
He's a doctor,

292
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:17,100
Bhai will make his dispensary here,
Where he's a doctor and patient too,

293
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,900
Give him knife and scissor and say
him that operate your own self,

294
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,700
I couldn't escape,

00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,000

297
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Uday Shetty?
He's the richest man of city,

298
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,400
Everyone respects him,

00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:54,700
In every meeting he added a 1 khokha
and he calls it Hafta (weekly)

300
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,700
It's a worth of lifetime,
Please save me from them,

301
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,600
I am in big trouble,

Don't cry,

304
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,400

00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,000
Please don't call me Jee,
Don't say a word,

306
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:28,100
Nowadays biscuit calls Parley Jee,
And you are a doctor,

307
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,100
You know, I attend poor people
without any charges, that's why

308
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,500
my hospital is going in loss,
Look at him,

309
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,000
He's a nice doctor and you...

310
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,700
Shetty, I didn't know that
he's your guy,

311
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,900
He's my friend,

312
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,100
Then he's like my elder,
That was my mistake,

313
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,700
What's going on here?
Your work has done, you go.

314
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,900
Sir, should I give him a slap,
I want to,

315
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,400
I'll never forget your debt,
No, It's not like that,

316
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,500
Yes, It is,
You are such an angel.

317
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,700
Decency is still in this world,
No, I am nothing,

318
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,300
But, If you think I am,
then do me a favour,

319
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,900
I have a sister,
Yes,

320
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,200
She is pretty,
Yes,

321
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,500
In the age of marriage,
Yes,

322
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,000
Now, I understand,
I have everything,

323
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,800
We have money, fame,
and respect.

324
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,600
I have a kind of respect, If I
wants to relate any family who

325
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,000
could not deny me.

326
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I need a decent guy.

327
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Who must be decent, nice and
belongs to a good family,

328
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,300
Who could...
Mr. Shetty!

329
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,700
You are asking to right person,

330
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,100
My own Nephew,

331
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,300
He's decent, nice and belongs
to a good family,

332
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,400
Amazing,
But we are not rich like you,

333
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,200
Pandit Jee, We will think about
Mahurat later, first I want to

334
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,400
to know his wish,
I am agreed,

335
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,400
You're agreed,
Then, I am also agree,

336
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,300
Look, you gave me a word
I won't take them back,

337
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,600
We are respected people,
And we mean it.

338
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,100
Mr. Ghunghroo,
Listen to me,

339
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,500
I want to tell you about
Mr. Shetty,

340
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,700
What you would tell me?
I've seen him,

341
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,300
He's not human but Bhagwan.

342
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,400
Come on Pandit,
Today is the lucky day,

343
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,200
I am telling you, It's not
your lucky day.

344
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,000
What happen Uncle?
You are smiling today,

345
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,400
I fixed your marriage in a nice
people, If you heard them you

346
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,100
will loose your senses,
Tell him Pandit Jee,

347
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,500
Truly, He is such a decent man,

348
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,700
He's not a decent but a murderer,

349
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,600
His morning starts with the bullets,

350
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,000
And Until If he didn't kill 10-12
people his night did not over,

351
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
What rubbish?
I Swear,

352
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,100
Shetty is a Don,
Don?

353
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,500
Majnu and Shetty traps you
together, you don't understand,

354
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,100
I have a bad luck,
You broke the steering,

355
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,400
Don't look at them like that,

356
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,600
These all people came here to
enjoy, to play, to laugh,

357
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,000
But not like us to think how
to get rid of those bad guys,

358
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,800
Blame to me,
You also blame to me,

359
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,700
If you were there, May be we
should finish or your marriage

360
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,500
was happened on gun point,

361
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,800
You didn't think about before,
Now what?

362
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,100
You can't judge people,
You are absolutely right,

363
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,400
If I do, Should I marry her,

364
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:23,000
Stop it, I am dying and
you guys start fighting,

365
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,900
Just think, what will happen to me,
How?

366
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,500
I can't think to the front of her,
I have go away from here,

367
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,500
My money is wasting?
And my mind is not working,

368
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,500
These half naked people,
Rajeev!

369
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,000
I got an Idea, and they
can't do nothing of us,

370
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,100
I met a girl, whom I was
looking for a long time,

371
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,800
You found a new trouble
for me,

372
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,100
She is not trouble,
she is the solution of trouble,

373
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,800
Do one thing,

374
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,500
Just try to make her falls in
love with you then marry her,

375
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,800
Then I'll excuse to Shetty,

376
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,100
I want my nephew to marry
with your sister but...

377
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,900
He was a scoundrel,
He married 3 months before

378
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,900
without my permission.

379
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,200
Now no matter what,
He is the big Don,

380
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,800
Will he marry his sister with
someone who's already married,

381
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,400
Look at the girl,
Uncle, I don't wanna see,

382
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,500
You know why I don't want to
Please explain him,

383
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,000
How do I?
I don't want to listen anything,

384
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,900
And one of the big reason is
that she belongs to good family,

385
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,100
Majnu Bhai!
If Sanjana will see this picture

386
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,800
then your character would be
naked like this,

387
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,800
Don't think about her,
I came here for change,

388
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,400
We got a news that some terrorists
had planted a bomb here,

389
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,400
Stop, stop,
please don't move,

390
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,900
We really don't know that
where is the bomb,

391
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,900
May be under that table,
maybe inside that ball,

392
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,600
and it will blast because
of your panic,

393
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,000
Look, We make you April fool
very easily,

394
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,400
Ladies and Gentleman,

from Frank fin and this trophy,

398
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,800
Sanjana, I think you didn't
recognize me,

399
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,500
Why not? You are the same guy
who save me from the fire,

400
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,100
Even you save me, I was
unconscious and carry me.

401
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:35,000
It's not my fault, Any body can
go out of mind to see you,

402
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,600
What's a date today?
1 April,

403
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:43,400
Are you making me April fool?
No, I am not, May I help you,

404
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,300
My height is larger than you,
I'll help you,

405
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,200
Whenever I go near to her,
Don't know where this air come from,

406
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,100
It's girl's scarf, you can't get it
so easily.

407
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,900
Now I didn't get relief until
I got this scarf.

408
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,300
It's nothing,

409
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,000
Sanjana, Dropati's Saree's here,

410
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,100
Enough...

411
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,100
You're just...

412
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,500
You're nephew can't set
a girl.

413
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,900
And this Udhay Shakti is
calling constantly.

414
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,400
I don't understand.
What should I do?

415
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,100
What else can we do?
Besides praying to God.

416
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,100
Oh Lord help me.

417
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,800
What kind of help is this?

418
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,400
Where did he go?

419
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,400
Listen.

420
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,200
What a place. Right?

421
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,600
Udhay Brother.

422
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,500
Yes Majnu.

423
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,700
Everything alright?

424
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,800
Upstairs death angel
and downstairs too.

425
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:20,500
That Ghungroo is missing.
I've been looking everywhere.

426
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,200
And he's not answering his
phone.

427
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,900
I tensed.
You come back quick.

428
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,200
How can I come Udhay Brother?

429
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,100
Who is going to take care
of Sanjana Madam?

430
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,700
Don't worry about Sanjana.
She has her friends with her.

431
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,000
They'll take care of her.
You come back quick.

432
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
That Ghungroo Saith...

433
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,600
You had this shoe...

434
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,700
Who is it?

435
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,300
Hey fruit without a tree.

436
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,700
If you want to suicide.
Then fall straight.

437
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,000
Or shall I make you fall?

438
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,700
Are you measuring the length
by throwing a shoe?

439
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,700
Why are you holding it?
Through it in the water.

440
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,700
Where?

441
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,700
Oh behind me!

442
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,800
Not the April fool again.

443
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,800
Oh blind folded...
I'll sneak out.

444
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,600
Got you!

445
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,500
Oh You...

446
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,600
Actually we were playing.

447
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,400
It's okay.

448
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,600
Are you upset with me?

449
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,900
No...
Not at all.

450
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,300
I think I can see it on your
face.

451
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,900
Why wouldn't you be upset?

452
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,100
Because we made April fool.

453
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,700
No...
It's nothing like that.

454
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,300
I also like pranks.

455
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,700
I can also prank you.
But I didn't do it.

456
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,200
Then we'll get along fine.

457
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,100
Come...
Let's have coffee.

458
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,200
No...
Coffee with you! No.

459
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,700
You made me April fool already.
I can't come.

460
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:37,900
Where is your necklace?

461
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,700
Where did it go?

462
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,700
It was on my neck just now.

463
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,500
Was it expensive?

464
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,200
It must be at least 3 million.

465
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,200
Find it.
Look over there.

466
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,300
Look over there.

467
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:02,200
Sanjana, Look there's your
necklace.

468
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,400
Thank God.
I found it.

469
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,700
I'll get it.

470
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,100
Where did he go?

471
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,100
Did he drown?

472
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,500
What are you looking for?

473
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,600
You! Did you
lose the necklace again?

474
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,300
Okay Uncle.
I'm leaving.

475
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,400
You're going out!
Do you want me dead?

476
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,400
Why?
What happened?

477
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,500
Nobody should know that
we've come back.

478
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,300
Stay in.

479
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,500
Uncle I'm going to meet
Sanjana's brother.

480
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:21,300
You said it yourself that
engagement should happen quick.

481
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,600
Sanjana's friends were telling
me that...

482
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,000
...her brother is a big man
of this city.

483
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,900
And if once...
We're in relation with them.

484
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,600
Then her brother will handle
Majnu and Shetty.

485
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,100
Why should we handle them?

486
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,100
Go on son.
Go from there.

487
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,300
God has given me everything.

488
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,200
I have money, fame...
Respect.

489
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,500
I just wanted a decent guy.

490
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,300
Today that search is over
too.

491
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,300
I like you very much.

492
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,500
Your family likes Sanjana.

493
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,400
What could be more happier
than this?

494
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:05,600
Sanjana's birthday is on 13th.
I was thinking that...

495
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,100
...lf engagement on same day.

496
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,900
How could we prepare so
fast?

497
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:13,900
What about preparations?
Just need to print 4 cards...

498
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:18,000
Need to invite 4 people
and two rings. That's it.

499
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,800
I think you're in hurry,
more than me.

500
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,600
If there's a problem...

501
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,600
There's no problem.

502
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:31,000
Now there can't be a problem
at all.

503
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,500
Today I have brought you
3 good news.

504
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,900
Tell your good new later.

505
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:39,100
First meet him. He's Sanjana's
going to be Fiancé.

506
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,300
Greetings.
Greetings.

507
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,600
Come see me before you
leave.

508
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,600
Understood?

509
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,600
Understood.

510
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,400
What happened?

511
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,400
It's strange...

512
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,500
In our time family would
do the talking. But...

513
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,400
But it's alright.

514
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,200
Whenever you say I'll bring
my family to meet you.

515
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,600
My new hotel is opening after
two days.

516
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,500
It's a small party.
Bring them.

517
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,600
Sure, I'll bring them.

518
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,100
Because of business.

519
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:26,000
If something bad comes at you.
Then they'll...

520
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
They'll give there life for me.

521
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
They'll also take life.

522
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,800
Why are you asking?

523
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,600
Nothing serious.
Actually a man...

524
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,200
Actually he's not one man.
They're two.

525
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,700
They've bothered me so much.

526
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,100
Who are they?

527
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,200
They're from the higher level.

528
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,600
Tell me.
I'll bring them to right level.

529
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,300
Now we're related.
Your problem is my problem.

530
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,800
God willing nobody can
bother us in this city.

531
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,100
Tell me.
Who is it?

532
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,900
It's enough that you
said this much.

533
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,000
I'll talk to them myself.

534
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,200
Okay talk to them.

535
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,300
Or let them talk to me.
I'll handle it on the phone.

536
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,300
Okay.

537
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:13,500
You're 2 seconds late.
The guy just left.

538
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,500
Which guy?

539
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,100
The one Sanjana loves.

540
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,900
I've fixed the engagement
on 13th.

541
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,600
Then what about my
painter guy?

542
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,500
Take him out of the painting.
Make a building there.

543
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,100
What are you saying
Udhay Bhai?

544
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,200
I worked so hard to get
him inside.

545
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,400
Now you're saying,
Make a building.

546
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,200
You've worked hard that
doesn't mean that...

547
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,200
...I should give my sister's
hand to anyone.

548
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,400
You don't understand
Udhay Bhai.

549
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,100
I couldn't paint his decency
right in hurry.

550
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,900
Look Sanjana loves this guy.

551
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,000
And his family also likes
Sanjana very much.

552
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
It's fixed itself.

553
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,900
Let go of your guy.

554
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,700
Sir I can't control my
excitement.

555
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,000
I don't want to ask
but I can't be, without asking.

556
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,800
That's alright too.

557
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,900
I don't understand that...

558
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,900
...who are you selecting and
who are you rejecting?

559
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,200
Come, I'll tell you.

560
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,800
What happened?
Did I do something wrong?

561
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,800
Doctor GHUNGROO.

562
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,500
Relationship cancel.

563
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,400
What are you saying!?

564
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,600
What are you saying?
Relationship cancel.

565
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,400
You disappeared after meeting,
hugging and fixing relationship...

566
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,500
...with my Udhay brother.

567
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,900
No, I went to prepare for
engagement and wedding so...

568
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,100
...I got a little late.

569
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,700
Too late.

570
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,200
Now our sister is in love
with someone else.

571
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,800
Sorry from Udhay brother.

572
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,600
What sorry!?

573
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,100
My nephew will die.

574
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,500
Can I ask, Why did you
bring my uncle here like this?

575
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,600
People who don't pickup our
calls, we pick them up like this.

576
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,600
What do you think?

577
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,000
They've canceled the relationship.

578
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,400
They brought me here to
tell me that.

579
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,000
Cancel?

580
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,100
Try to understand.

581
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:57,200
But still uncle they could've
done this politely.

582
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,400
Hey let him speak.

583
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,100
He was bothered.

584
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,600
Speak.

585
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,800
It's good that you've canceled
the relationship otherwise...

586
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,300
...we were going to cancel it.

587
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,800
Because I love someone else.

588
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,900
And soon I'll be engaged.

589
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,100
One minute uncle.

590
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,400
Do you know who
are those people?

591
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,000
Who are they?

592
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,800
They're very big people.

593
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,700
They can buy you and your...
What's his name?

594
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,700
Shetty?
Yes Mr. Shetty.

595
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,400
...10 people just like that.

596
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,600
Do you understand?
Mr. Majnu Bhai.

597
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,800
That's why we disappeared.

598
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
To think about how to get
rid of thugs like you?

599
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:47,400
If the brother is like that.
What would his sister be?

600
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,200
And their parents...
I don't know.

601
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:54,400
I never would've made this
relation even if I die.

602
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,100
Majnu Bhai! You pick up whoever
you like...

603
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:01,000
...remember that someone can
pick you up too.

604
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Hey enough of you.
Nobody can touch our brother.

605
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,200
Not even touch him!?

606
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,200
Here I touched him.

607
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,700
If someone tries to even touch
me, you can't even imagine...

608
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,100
...what could happen to you?

609
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:19,600
Here, I touched him again.
What are you going to do?

610
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,600
Hey who's behind you?

611
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,900
You want to know.
Do you want to talk to him?

612
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:28,300
Take this phone.
Shall I dial it for you?

613
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,000
Would you like to talk?

614
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,300
Can you handle it?

615
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,200
What happened?
You're quiet suddenly.

616
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,800
Hey look here.
I touched him third time.

617
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,800
Rajiv, Don't touch him.
You'll create a problem.

618
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Here I'm touching again.

619
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,700
Seems like he's got a
very big hand behind him.

620
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,300
But who could be bigger than
Majnu Bhai and Udhay Bhai?

621
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,100
Only one man.

622
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,100
George Bush.

623
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,100
Right.

624
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,100
How are you Mr. Mayor?

625
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:10,900
Mr. Shetty you've build a very
nice hotel.

626
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,200
Just because of your prayers.

627
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,700
Brother I see all decent
people in the party.

628
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,800
Only White Collar people
are invited.

629
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:21,600
So Me and Udhay Bhai could
also look decent among them.

630
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:25,900
You think you look decent
after shaving your beard!

631
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:31,300
I received the invitation but
where's Rajiv and his family?

632
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,600
They must be on their way.

633
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,200
See uncle...
Do you see the crowd?

634
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,200
I'm laughing on the guy who
is in love with Shetty's sister.

635
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,800
Uncle it's not nice.

636
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,600
You shouldn't laugh like
this on someone's ruins.

637
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:52,000
But I feel sorry for his family.

638
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,800
They'll have to cry all
their life.

639
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,500
You're right.

640
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:00,100
They're the ones whom
proposal we rejected.

641
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,000
What are you doing
in this party?

642
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,800
The person who owns this
hotel and threw this party...

643
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:17,000
...my nephew's engagement
is fixed with his sister.

644
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,900
Mr. Ghungroo.
It's amazing.

645
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,000
You've found a very decent
family.

646
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:22,900
Absolutely.

647
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,200
By the way if you wanted to
make relation with them.

648
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,100
Then what was wrong with
our family?

649
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:29,100
Come on.

650
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,200
What did he say?
What?

651
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,800
Brother, Rajiv's family has
arrived.

652
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,800
Bhai Saheb, This is my
Uncle and...

653
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,200
And Uncle this is my brother.

654
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,000
Aunty, Why isn't he getting
conscious?

655
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I don't know son.

656
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,700
What shall I do?

657
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:25,200
What shall I do after
getting conscious?

658
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:28,700
The proposal we were running
from...

659
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
How could I knew that the same
proposal is running after us.

660
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:39,300
Sanjana is the sister of
Don Udhay Shetty.

661
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,700
Again?

662
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,800
Doctor, please check.

663
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:59,300
100 Udhay and Majnu will die
and 1 Ghungroo will be born.

664
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:04,000
He had to get unconscious.

665
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,700
Do you know what he said
when I called him to cancel.

666
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:11,900
I never would've made this
relation even if I die.

667
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:17,000
If the brother is like that.
What would his sister be?

668
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,200
And their parents...
What would they be?

669
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,500
That's why we disappeared.

670
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,800
To think about how to get
rid of thugs like you?

671
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:29,700
He ran off to get rid of
the criminal family.

672
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,700
I'll grant his wish.

673
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:33,900
Bring the car.
Come on.

674
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,100
Don't forget that it's about
our sister's life.

675
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:43,100
She loves that guy.

676
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,000
If you kill his uncle,
so there will be no wedding.

677
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,600
She's not marrying the Uncle.

678
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,300
You don't understand what
you're saying in anger.

679
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,400
It'll be a family relation.
You're going to be In-Laws.

680
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,100
Who am I?
No one.

681
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,400
I can do anything.
Anything.

682
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,800
Yes you can do anything.

683
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,100
Go, do anything.

684
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,700
But make him understand
that who's Udhay Shetty.

685
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,000
And what's his reality.

686
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,900
And what will he do
if he's out of his mind.

687
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:11,800
Here take this. Shoot right
near his ear like this.

688
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,800
I have the weapon.
I'll shoot so right that...

689
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:18,800
...He'll himself will bring his
nephew to us for the wedding.

690
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,100
You don't worry.
I'm going to handle it.

691
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:30,400
Majnu's not a less of a swine.
He'll make everything alright.

692
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,700
Hey genius.
Come on get up.

693
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:52,200
Give me the piece.
Hold the coat.

694
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,800
Look I'm telling you for the
last time.

695
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,600
Get up or you'll be sent up
forever.

696
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,000
I didn't get unconscious
to get conscious.

697
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
You won't get up!?

698
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,400
Where's the ammo?
Other pocket.

699
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,800
And the piece in the other
pocket!

700
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:10,300
Have you taken my bounty
or what?

701
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,500
If something happens someday
then you'll be filling the gun...

702
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,300
...and someone will shoot me
down. Understood?

703
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:17,500
Bhai, Who could shoot you
down?

704
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,600
But if I put the gun and ammo
in the same pocket...

705
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,700
...I don't how many people
you'll shoot then.

706
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:23,700
Here's the ammo.

707
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,100
Bhai has filled the gun.

708
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:29,500
There's still time.
Get up Ghungroo or...

709
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:44,100
Bhai, He's not responding at all.

710
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,400
But we have the responsibility
to get him up.

711
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,400
Take his pants off.

712
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:51,300
Naked.

713
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,300
Everybody gets naked in front
of the doctor.

714
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,600
So the doctor himself today.

715
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:01,200
Bhai, He's already very nude
man.

716
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:09,000
Bhai, Let go of the middle one.
Let's speak to the main party.

717
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,200
We're thugs, don...

718
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:45,600
So what? Our sisters
and daughter can't get married.

719
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,000
You love our Sanjana. Right?

720
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,700
Are you going to leave
her hanging?

721
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,700
Look genius.
Invitations are out.

722
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,700
Whole city knows.

723
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,800
If this engagement doesn't go
as planed.

724
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,800
What'll happen to Udhay Bhai's
image?

725
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:18,900
Tell me.

726
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,300
Now are you going to wake up
your uncle or shall I?

727
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,200
Look you make him sniff
cocaine, heroine whatever...

728
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,900
Just bring him to the
engagement.

729
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,900
Or I'll kill your whole family.

730
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,300
You'll kill us!
How can you?

731
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,600
Look up.

732
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:54,600
You, your uncle and your aunty.

733
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:57,900
All of you will be like
those pigeons.

734
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,200
What am I hearing?
Hey Hungry.

735
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
You shot at his uncle!

736
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,400
What was I suppose to
do?

737
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,200
He was acting unconscious.
Old man.

738
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,300
Calling him old man.
He don't have manners.

739
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,800
You'll call his uncle old man!

740
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,700
Don't forget that the old man
is my going to be relative.

741
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,600
I'm asking.
Why did you have to shoot?

742
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,400
I thought it'll bring his
conscious back.

743
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:45,100
Ask him. What if a bullet would
have gone through him?

744
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:47,100
I made a mistake.
Sorry.

745
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,100
How long will I bare your
mistakes?

746
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Did I tell you to go shoot?
Did I? No. Right?

747
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Why did you shoot?

748
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:00,200
And Bhai Saheb that thing
I told about waking uncle up.

749
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,400
And those ugly hand signs.

750
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,700
What does he mean?
How were you waking him up?

751
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,500
Swine, How hard was it
to make this relation?

752
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,600
We have found such a decent
and intelligent guy.

753
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,800
You're trying to mess up the
relationship. Swine, I'll kill you.

754
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,500
Kill me.

755
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:19,100
But whoever gives you tension
I wont spear that person.

756
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:22,200
What shall I do of him?

757
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:27,100
I can't even kill him.
Because he loves me.

758
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:29,800
Ballu tell him...
What did he do?

759
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,400
Did you hear that?

760
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,300
He's not bad at heart.

761
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:46,900
He can't see me in tension.

762
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,600
Why do you worry so much?

763
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,600
Sanjana's engagement will be
on 13th.

764
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,800
Rajiv's very understanding.

765
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,400
He'll bring his uncle to his mind.

766
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,300
Don't you worry?

767
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:59,700
Then ask him yourself.

768
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:03,000
Will he bring his uncle to
engagement or Shall I?

769
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,400
Now you bring him.
Mr. Majnu.

770
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,000
My uncle is like my parents.

771
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,800
I can't bare If someone
disrespects my parent.

772
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:15,800
I love your sister very much.

773
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,500
And I will always.

774
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:21,500
But I won't get married over
guns.

775
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,800
I'm leaving.

776
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,500
If you want to stop me.
Shoot me in the back.

777
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,400
I'll apologize on his behalf.

778
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,600
What are you doing?

779
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:55,300
Today a brother is begging
for his sister's happiness.

780
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:59,400
I apologize for what
I've done.

781
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:05,300
Being in the bad business
I forgot the value of people.

782
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,100
Now only you can stop
what's coming.

783
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:30,900
Our brother has flew from Italy
to be in the engagement.

784
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:34,300
Who's that new brother?

785
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,400
Our elder brother.

786
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:58,400
I've brought this gift for
both of my lions.

787
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,700
Not half.
He's full crack.

788
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:24,300
Hey go with Lucky.

789
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:29,200
After all your sister's marriage
is fixed.

790
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,200
Your tension is over.

791
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,300
Means my tension is over.

792
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,900
There will be dance in
party today.

793
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:41,000
But there's arrangement for
that, Sir.

794
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,200
I'm still alive.

795
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Stop

796
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:05,600
I'm ruined.
I'm destroyed.

797
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,900
I'm asking.
What did I do to you?

798
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:21,600
That you did this to me.

799
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,200
Such a big scandal.

800
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,100
Hey sister.
Please don't

801
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:32,600
Swine, I'm not your sister.
I'm your wife.

802
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:39,700
I don't even know you.
When did we get married?

803
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:44,100
And by the way we got
married while Uncle is around.

804
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:49,100
So uncle. What did you promise
in front of the whole village?

805
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:53,000
That, Girl once you grow up.
We'll come to get you.

806
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,100
I grew that old while waiting
for you.

807
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:00,100
How more old should I get?

808
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,200
Ishika!

809
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,000
Is she telling the truth?

810
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,300
What will this lair tell you?

811
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:11,600
I have brought the truth and
evidence both with me.

812
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:15,800
Me, That's my husband
and that's the uncle.

813
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:24,000
Bhai It's no mistake of mine.
My sister got them married.

814
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,600
I didn't know that she would
come here after all these years.

815
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,400
I think that God also wants
this be.

816
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:34,600
Did God came down to say that?
Or did God called you up there?

817
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:39,600
Down here it's our territory
And we make the decisions here.

818
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,600
Is there someone to bring
me justice?

819
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:49,100
Only they can bring you justice.
They're the biggest here.

820
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:23,300
I don't have a choice.

821
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Stop.

822
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,500
There will be justice.

823
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,400
I'll do the justice.

824
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,600
Bhai justice has already been
decided.

825
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,900
We have to through her out.

826
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:38,000
Don't forget that I'm still
alive.

827
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:45,100
On one side is your sister
and her happiness.

828
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:49,300
And on the other side
is this girls tears.

829
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:03,800
Majnu, My father used to take
me temple in my childhood.

830
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:07,000
There was something written
on temple wall.

831
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:12,200
A person has to bare what he's
done wrong in the same lifetime.

832
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:19,400
Everything is blurred from my childhood
accept that thing on the wall.

833
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:25,200
I think what I did wrong
is coming in my sister's way.

834
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:38,500
You're not just his sister in law.
You're also a good friend of Rajiv.

835
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,500
What did you do?

836
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:45,100
Sister, I was told that this
relationship was building by force.

837
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:47,300
Brother in law lied to me.

838
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:03,700
I'm compelled.
It's not a drama.

839
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,700
I promised you mother.

840
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,700
My sister made one mistake.

841
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,200
She married in a criminal family.

842
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,400
And she bared that all her life.

843
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:32,600
She told me when she handed
you to me.

844
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:37,900
That brother, don't even let the
shadow of crime on my son.

845
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:43,500
I don't have any objection
with this relationship.

846
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:46,400
I have objection with relatives.

847
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:05,400
What if Sanjana's brother leave
the criminal life and become wise.

848
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:18,400
If that happens. Then I'll happily
accept Sanjana as your bride.

849
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,600
And I'll dance in your wedding.

850
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:26,100
But if you couldn't change him.

851
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:31,300
Then the girl you choose
for Rajiv, I'll give Rajiv's hand...

852
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:34,200
...in her hand with my
own hand.

853
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:39,300
I'll dance in his wedding.

854
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:46,000
Are you mad?
I won't be the film director.

855
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:47,300
I have small kids.

856
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,700
You want my wife to
be an orphan.

857
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:51,800
Sir please say something.

858
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,600
I won't become the producer
either.

859
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,900
Underworld Don Udhay Shetty.

860
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:58,900
Hero!
Fake film shooting.

861
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:01,800
If he finds out bullets will real.

862
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,700
Uncle I'll try my best not
let it come to this.

863
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:06,700
Try!

864
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,300
Try mean guarantee.

865
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:13,700
And sir all preparations have
been made.

866
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:15,000
Sunil Shetty has also agreed.

867
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:15,700
Sunil Shetty!

868
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:19,800
Yes. Mr. Sunil Shetty.
Staying in the same hotel.

869
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,300
But you're married in Udhay's
knowledge.

870
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:31,000
What will you do about
that?

871
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,600
I'll explain it to him that
it was Rajiv's uncles game.

872
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,600
Sunil Shetty?
Yes, He's the lead.

873
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:51,800
Rajiv, tell your director friend
to ask Sunil Shetty to Udhay.

874
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:16,000
No Sir,
You're a genius, a great director.

875
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:22,700
From tomorrow you're shooting
with me or else your out of the film.

876
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,700
Okay Sir.
As you wish.

877
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,600
You think if you won't work with
me, I'll come to streets.

878
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,300
Now film we'll be shot
without you.

879
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:38,600
What have you done?
What's a film without the star.

880
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,600
I'll bring someone from the
street and make him a star.

881
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
I found him sir.

882
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,600
What are you doing?
He can't work.

883
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:07,600
Why?

884
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,900
He doesn't know acting.

885
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:11,300
He just runs his bussiness...

886
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:17,500
These aren't eyes, it's a camera and
it has recognized the talent in you.

887
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,500
Udhay always wanted to work
in the movies.

888
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:27,600
You can't bare this person.

889
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:28,300
Why?

890
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:31,600
He's mad. They way he was
talking to Mr. Sunil Shetty.

891
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:34,500
But not with me...
I'll bare a bit.

892
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:38,100
Do you have the time
for all this?

893
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,600
There's always time for this.

894
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,200
Who's Udday among you?

895
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Hello Mr. Udday!

896
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:17,300

Don't you guys know that this
house is illegal

899
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:25,700
But don't you know

900
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:27,400

902
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:34,200
Isn't anything namely, Law?

903
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:37,100
No don't worry!

904
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:38,500
I'm just horrible by looks,

905
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,000
instead I'm a good guy!

906
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:42,100

907
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,400

Quite good Udday Bhai,

913
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:02,100
Was it a complex by film star?

914
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:04,100
Ballu!

915
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:06,000
Tell him!

916
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,900
I have one fake leg,
and I'm a star of Hockey!!

917
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:11,100
Not this! Tell him what
happened at Mahurat!

918
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,500
Oho!!

01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,500
It was fantastic!

920

They take Bhai as hero,
while take Sunil sheety out of the film!

921
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:22,400
He said to take anyone from roadside,

922
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:24,900
no no, he said I'm not taking anyone from
roadside,

923
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:27,900
while I'm taking a big actor in this film

924
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,700

925
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:34,000

But I'm smelling!

932
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,900
Hey Majnu, stand up,
and turn around!

933
01:31:56,900 --> 01:32:00,300
Hey look smoke coming out
from your back!

934
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:11,900
I just told you that this house
is illegal,

935
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,500
Not myself!

936
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,700
Then why did you broke me?

937
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:18,100
Common get up!

938
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:22,900
Take out Potatoes!

939
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,200
Take out Potatoes!

940
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:26,200
Take out Potatoes!

941
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:41,600
Just notice this thing!

942
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,000
I'm giving quite big actor,
to this world today!

943
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,800
Keep it up!

944
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:48,300
Let's get ready for next shot!

945
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:55,300
That was great,

946
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,400
you are quite talented!

947
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:59,400
Amazing!

948
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:01,300
Sanjana, won't you say anything?

949
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:04,500
I was thinking, It was much difficult,
for you

950
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:07,400
but you done it well quite easily!

951
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:13,300
I have written a fantastic dialogue,
Please tell me!

952
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:16,400
Not a single potatoes sold out
out till this morning!

953
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,400
Nor a half Kandha!

954
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,100
Till morning, not a single potatoes
sold out,

955
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:27,400
nor sold out a half Kandha!

956
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,100
In which line you are in now?

957
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:31,100
It's film line!

958
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,700
You are just only for acting!

959
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:43,200
Till morning, not a single potatoes
sold out,

960
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,700
Madam wants to meet you!

961
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:49,600
Who Madam?

962
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,600
Actress of this film!

963
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:05,700
She is Miss Esha!

964
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:07,200
Mind blowing!

965
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,200
Fantastic!

966
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:12,200
No one can think, that
this is your first film

967
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:14,500
and this is first day of your shooting!

968
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:16,000
I'm glad to meet you Udday!

969
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Same here!

970
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,800
I hope you don't mind me
calling you Udday!

971
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:23,000
No!
Madam your shot is ready!

972
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
She's coming,
wait!

973
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Udday please don't mind,

974
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,200
I was here to sign out this film,

975
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:35,000
Because as I come to know,
that director has changed the actor,

976
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,900
I wasn't very comfortable

977
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:38,100
you know!

978
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:39,900
But when I see your acting,

979
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:41,300
Oh my God!

980
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:43,900
The way you said that dialogue!

981
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,600
Take out Potato,
take out Kanda!

982
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:48,600
You made me your fan

983
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:52,700
I just tried to act,
keeping actors in mind,

984
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:54,800
I want your autograph!

985
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:56,800
Oh yes!

986
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,600
Welcome!

987
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:12,100
It'll be now much fun
to do work together!

988
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,400
Bye!

989
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:20,700
Brother!
What?

990
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:23,400
Seems this actress have
fallen for your love!

991
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:25,400
Shut up!

992
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,300
I love your daughter very much!

993
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:39,800
Now nothing can make us separated!

994
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,100
What a look brother!

995
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:46,400
Looking nice?

996
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:47,600
Very much!

997
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,600
What are you doing on my shooting?

998
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,600
Brother!
Yes

999
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:53,900
today meeting is fixed with D'Silva!

1000
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:55,900
I also called Samuel from Singapore!

1001
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:57,800
It's quite necessary
for you to come!

1002
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:00,100
This is the last shot,
just going to Pack up!

1003
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:04,600
Than we'll go meet them, if agreed
than ok otherwise we'll kill him!

1004
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:07,400
Looks like we two
can't get married! Rajeev!

1005
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:12,500
As the Shot here ends,
there Brother's crime scene will start!

1006
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:17,200
Sanjana once you told me,
your brother is afraid of horses!

1007
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:19,200
Yes why?

1008
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:24,900
Why these horses here for?

1009
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,800
Because director
changed the shot!

1010
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,400
First you were coming,
on legs,

1011
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,000
to ask girl's hand from her father,

1012
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,200
but now you'll come
with 25 men on horses!

1013
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:33,100
On horses!

1014
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:34,600
How can he ask for her hand,

1015
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:36,200
he don't know how to ride the horse!

1016
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:39,700
We can ride our horse, but these
horses are difficult to ride!

1017
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:40,700
Brother,

1018
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:43,200
just sit on the horse,
it'll go by itself!

1019
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:47,600
But first shot was good,
I came walking and ask for hand!

1020
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:51,700
Brother you know, if I go to make
him understand, he could pack up this movie,

1021
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:52,900
do you want to close this picture?

1022
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:54,900
No
than!

1023
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,100
Tell me which horse
you want to ride!

1024
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,800
Give me anyone you like!

1025
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:23,300
Cut
Cut!

1026
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:27,700
What are you doing!

1027
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:29,700
Father of Girl is here!

1028
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:31,600
Aren't you seeing such big man?

1029
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:34,200
You have to stop the horse here,

1030
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,700
then walk towards him
and ask for hand!

1031
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:37,000
It's quite simple!

1032
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,500
It don't stop,
what can I do?

1033
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:39,500
Horse don't stop itself,

1034
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:40,600
you have to stop it!

1035
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:41,600
You have to pull his belt

1036
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,800
Let's try it one
more time

1037
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,400
Sound,

1038
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:49,400
Take 32

1039
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,700
Action!

1040
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:53,800
Come!

1041
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:58,500
Why are you going
before me!

1042
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:04,600
Where you are?

1043
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:06,500
Cut it!

1044
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:08,500
Where are you?

1045
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:10,700
I'm here!

1046
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:12,800
What are you doing in the middle?

1047
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,100
The girl's father is here!

1048
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:16,400
Horse is not doing as I want,

1049
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:17,600
what can I do?

1050
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:20,900
So what we should do?
Should we pack up?

1051
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:23,300
Take away the horses!

1052
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:28,200
We are coming, I told you,
we are coming in half hour!

1053
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:30,300
Why are you bothering?

1054
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:33,600
Now look, how their
meeting will cancel

1055
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,500
Udday Bhai, still stuck
in the shooting!

1056
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:37,500
Why you let D'Silva go?

1057
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:40,200
Can't you make him wait
for half hour?

1058
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:43,200
Who is this Non-sense
shouting here?

1059
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:48,100
Director Sir,

1060
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:49,900
Relax!!

1061
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:50,700
What Relax!!

1062
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:52,400
Our Shot is stuck,
and they are talking non-sense over phone!

1063
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:54,700
You please just keep quiet!

1064
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:07,400
Action!

1065
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:10,300
Hey!!

1066
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:20,900
I'm here to ask your daughter's hand!

1067
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:22,200
Cut it!

1068
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:24,000
Cut it!

1069
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
What are you doing?

1070
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,000
What, I was perfect, walked on my knees,

1071
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:29,500
this way you are going to ask for her hand!

1072
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:31,100
By falling here and there,

1073
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:32,600
will he give you her daughter,
in such way?

1074
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:35,200
Not on us, but at least have some
mercy on horses!

1075
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:36,200
Please
please one shot!

1076
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:38,200
Oh common!

1077
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,100
What actor have I signed for my film!

1078
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:49,100
Poor horse must be thinking,
which donkey is riding me?

1079
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:51,100
Non sense Donkey!

1080
01:39:58,400 --> 01:39:59,500
Hey whom you say Donkey!

1081
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:00,400
You Said Udday a donkey?

1082
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:03,500
Shut it down this
all shooting drama!

1083
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:08,400
You are going to make
Udday brother beg?

1084
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:11,000
People beg in front
of Udday brother!

1085
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
What if Udday's horse
go front or left behind,

1086
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,100
can't he come towards Udday brother!

1087
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:17,600
Where's that oldie?

1088
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:18,800
Majnu Bhai!

1089
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,800
What are you doing?

1090
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,500
Who has done all this?

1091
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:38,000
Majnu Bhai did this!

1092
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,300
He beat up director,

1093
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:42,300
he beat up producer

1094
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:43,700
he broke someone's nose,

1095
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:45,700
he broke someone's jaw

1096
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:48,300
look there, he broke everything!

1097
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:51,600
He also broke your
dream of being an actor!

1098
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,000
Say something, Director Sir!

1099
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,800

He's jealous of me,
Majnu!

1104
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,600
Nothing matter, how much you wash
charcoal!

1105
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:16,900
With surf, Nirma, Vim etc,

1106
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:19,600
it will always remain black!

1107

Same as these can't never change!

1108
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:25,500
Sanjana,

1109
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:28,000
I like these all five girls,

1110
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:31,500
now whose is capable for Rajeev,

1111
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:33,900
I leave it on you to decide!

1112
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,600
Once my brother could be good,

1113
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:46,600
but this Majnu just...

1114
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:50,200
Sanjana, these guys
are just like crabs!

1115
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:56,200
If one wants to be good,
the other, let him down by pulling his leg,

1116
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:58,200
maybe this is our fate!

1117
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:01,100
No Sanajana!

1118
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:06,000
Now Majnu Bhai won't decide
for our luck!

1119
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:12,000
But we'll decide his luck now!

1120
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:17,400
You name is false Majnu Ji!

1121
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:23,800
While your name must begin with "S"

1122
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:28,600
well yes my real name is Saagar!

1123
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:34,100
Saagar Ji, please bring some
scars on your forehead!

1124
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:39,200
You have an affair with a girl
when you were 18!

1125
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:41,900
Don't be shy,

1126
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:43,500
look up!

1127
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:45,500
Make it deep!

1128
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:52,900
That girl name begin with "l"

1129
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:55,300
you remember?

1130
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:56,700
Iravati!

1131
01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:58,700
Iravati!

1132
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:01,300
Sanjana!

1133
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:03,400
The girl he fall in love with,

1134
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:05,900
Once her brother broke down
his hands and legs,

1135
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:07,800
Am I right?

1136
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:10,500
They just broke my hands,
my Leg broke while falling in the drain!

1137
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:12,500
That's honesty!

1138
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,800
Because of Iravati, you came into
crime world!

1139
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,700
Yes!

1140
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:19,600
Because her father, told him to make
fame, money!

1141
01:43:19,700 --> 01:43:22,600
You murdered someone
for sake of money!

1142
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:24,800
And you are here,
keep running from than!

1143
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:27,800
But this all are old talkies
Rajeev!

1144
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:29,500
What will happen afterward?

1145
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:32,700
That love will came back to your life,

1146
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:36,400
but what become of children?

1147
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,400
What children?

1148
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:40,600
She has four kids!

1149
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:42,600
If she comes in my life!

1150
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:44,900
What will become of her children?

1151
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:47,500
Children will remain with her,

1152
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:50,300
and Iravati is not coming
in your life again,

1153
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:53,800
A girl like Iravati will
come in your life!

1154
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:56,400
Whose name will begin with "l"

1155
01:43:57,700 --> 01:43:59,400
once bring bring some scars!

1156
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:02,600
Don't make me scare,
a bit less scars!

1157
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,000
She must have come by now!

1158
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Oh! Now I get it!

1159
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:13,100
These paintings etc, why you
keep them prisoned at your home

1160
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:14,300
let them out!

1161
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:16,000
There rains a lot outside,

1162
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,300
the paintings could get wet

1163
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:19,000

There is a big tension!

1258
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:07,500

01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:19,900
Hey Rajeev do me a favor!

1264
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:23,500
Look to Udday's hand and tell him
that your meeting is cancel,

1265
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:24,200
no,

1266
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:25,500
tell him his life is in danger!

1267
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:27,200
Sagar Ji, please don't mind,

1268
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:29,700
tell you what, I can not lie!

1269
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:34,100
By the way, this problem is
created by your own self!

1270
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:38,200
Shooting was going quite smoothly,
you beat that director for no reason

1271
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:41,200
If shooting was still going,
Udday Bhai won't ever cancel this shooting!

1272
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:42,400
Would he ever go to Italy?

1273
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:44,100
No no way!

1274
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:47,300
Rajeev Bhai, but that
director is your friend!

1275
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:48,800
Please begin that shooting again,

1276
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,900
you remember you slapped him,

1277
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:52,900
besides he's so stubborn,
he won't agree,

1278
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:55,300
how won't he agree, I'll see him,

1279
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:56,600
this is the thing I don't like about you,

1280
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:58,400
why you go over families on such
small talks!

1281
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:00,100
Why you get ready to fight every time!

1282
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:02,200
You can say this by love

1283
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:04,200
Rajeev Bhai, you just don't get mad,

1284
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:06,200
you want me to make him understand,
very politely!

1285
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:10,300
Besides, this love is quite lovely thing!

1286
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:46,600
Sanjana weds Rajeev!

1287
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:51,800
I can't believe yet, how this impossible
can be possible!

1288
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:54,200
But I have total faith in you,

1289
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:58,400
that to get your love, you definitely,
will win this fight!

1290
01:53:58,400 --> 01:53:59,500
Lucky Please!
Get up!

1291
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:00,500
Lucky!

1292
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:02,900
What do you think of yourself?

1293
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:06,800
How dare you to change path
of Majnu and Udday?

1294
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:09,300
Lucky listen to me!
Please!

1295
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:13,800
Lucky Sorry Sorry!

1296
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:17,200
You beat me!

1297
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:18,900
Son of RDX

1298
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:20,700
I'm going to kill you!

1299
01:54:20,700 --> 01:54:21,400
Sanjana you get aside!

1300
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:22,900
I'm going to finish you!

1301
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:24,800
Sanjana you get aside!

1302
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,800
You'll close down our business!

1303
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:29,300
No lucky!

1304
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:32,200
You are rotting our people!

1305
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:34,400
Lucky leave Rajeev!

1306
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,300
What will you do??

1307
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:37,300
I'll shoot
you will shoot me!

1308
01:54:37,300 --> 01:54:39,100
You'll shoot me!
Go on shoot me!

1309
01:54:39,100 --> 01:54:41,000
I won't leave him!

1310
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Lucky stop it!

1311
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:06,100
I was just firing upside!

1312
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:15,600
This bullet is shot from me,

1313
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,800
I killed Lucky!

1314
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:21,400
Did you hear me?

1315
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:25,400
Let's go!

1316
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:27,400
He's still alive!

1317
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:32,400
Brother!!

1318
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:37,900
Hey!!

1319
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:40,800
Don't worry
I'm here!

1320
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:42,500
Where's the party?

1321
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:46,800
Rajeev Bhai, don't worry,
I'll make everything fine!

1322
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:49,400
Sorry!

1323
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:53,900
Sorry!!!

1324
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:08,900
To whom you shot at?

1325
01:56:08,900 --> 01:56:10,300
Bhaiya!

1326
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:11,400
I'm telling...

1327
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:13,400
I'm telling...

1328
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:15,300
you keep quiet!

1329
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:17,300
It was a mistake by me!

1330
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:20,200
I made a mistake!

1331
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:22,200
Control!

1332
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:24,700
Udday Bhai,

1333
01:56:24,700 --> 01:56:26,100
we all can get killed,

1334
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:27,900
how can we tell RDX sir,

1335
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:30,600
Sir you don't worry about RDX sir!

1336
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:32,100
I have solved that problem!

1337
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:34,700
I told him that his son is shot

1338
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:37,000
and he's in hospital here!

1339
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:41,400
What was the need to tell him that!

1340
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:42,600
What was the need?

1341
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:44,400
Why did you tell him?

1342
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:45,700
I'll kill you bastard!

1343
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:48,900
He's saying me bastard, and kill you!

1344
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:52,000
What do you mean?

1345
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,200
Means that he's not
going to last much!

1346
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:57,400
He can be dead anytime!

1347
01:56:58,300 --> 01:57:02,200
Mean RDX sir couldn't get the chance
to talk to his son,

1348
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:05,100
and we can tell him
any fake story!

1349
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:07,400
Whatever you say Udday Bhai,

1350
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:09,900
but the girl is quite intelligent!

1351
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:11,900
Thank you!

1352
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:15,800
But Doctor, are you sure
he'll be dead?

1353
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:17,600
I can guarantee!

1354
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:22,600
So should I call to graveyard, and
ask for his reservation?

1355
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:26,300
Dad!
Let my dad come!

1356
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:39,900
Udday and Majnu,

1357
01:57:39,900 --> 01:57:41,900
don't ever your eyes

1358
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
tell me how is lucky?

1359
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:46,600
Not is... say was!

1360
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:48,200
No!

1361
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:50,200
No!

1362
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:52,200
This can't be happened!

1363
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:00,500
Sir!

1364
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:04,700
Sir, you too left us in this world?

1365
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:06,700
I'm not going anywhere!

1366
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:10,500
I'm alive!

1367
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:13,100
Come, take me to Lucky!

1368
01:58:18,100 --> 01:58:20,400
RDX can come in any minute,
everything is ready?

1369
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:21,700
Uncle!

1370
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:23,800
Uncle! Everything Okay?

1371
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:24,700
Yeah!

1372
01:58:24,700 --> 01:58:25,900
Lucky finished?

1373
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:27,900
Completely!

1374
01:58:34,700 --> 01:58:35,900
I'm still alive you scoundrels!

1375
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:37,200
I'm not dead yet!

1376
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:40,100
I'll kill each and everyone of you!

1377
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:46,400
I'm a hockey player,
my leg is fake,

1378
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:47,400
he can run uncle!

1379
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:49,400
You also run!

1380
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:54,900
You were one legged!

1381
01:58:54,900 --> 01:58:56,800
How you recover?

1382
01:58:56,900 --> 01:59:00,500
Udday Bhai, made me kind of
Visiting card of whole gang!

1383
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:02,400
Whomever he want to scare,

1384
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,600
he make me stand and
say speak Ballu!

1385
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:05,600
Now run Ballu!

1386
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:07,700
Why are you running taking these woods,

1387
01:59:07,700 --> 01:59:11,600
wherever I find him, I'll burn him
right there!

1388
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:21,700
Lucky can kill anyone!

1389
01:59:21,700 --> 01:59:23,600
Someone can kill lucky,

1390
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:25,800
he can never commit suicide!

1391
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:27,800
Stop lucky!

1392
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Sir, will we lie to you?

1393
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:33,300
Sir you don't believe us!!

1394
01:59:36,900 --> 01:59:39,300
Why Lucky committed suicide?

1395
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:44,200
This thing only one person know,
whose Lucky himself!

1396
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:55,100
Lucky run away from graveyard!

1397
01:59:55,100 --> 01:59:57,000
Run away!!

1398
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,200
Who run away?

1399
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:02,200
The Pandit run away, as he
come to knew you name

1400
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:04,400
Get that bastard!

1401
02:00:04,900 --> 02:00:07,100
You hearted what's Sir saying...
Get that bastard!

1402
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:09,200
Get that bastard... Okay!

1403
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:15,600
Daddy... Daddy!

1404
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:16,600
Daddy!

1405
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:17,900
How come he's your daddy?

1406
02:00:17,900 --> 02:00:19,300
Not mine, he's Lucky's Daddy!

1407
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:20,600
He's going over there!

1408
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:22,000
Dad! I'm here!

1409
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,900
Dad, I'm in here dad!

1410
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:29,700
I told him thousand times, why is he
still bringing RDX to graveyard!

1411
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:31,300
Rajeev Bhai, now what should we do?

1412
02:00:31,300 --> 02:00:32,800
Come let's go to graveyard!

1413
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:34,000
Common let's go!

1414
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,600
Who says Lucky is not here!

1415
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:37,000
Huh!

1416
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,900
But I can't see him!
Where is he?

1417
02:00:38,900 --> 02:00:40,300
He's standing right in front of me!

1418
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:42,400
No no!

1419
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:44,000
I don't want to be caught in this!

1420
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,500
I could have lay besides you,

1421
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:50,000
but RDX's son is dead, not daughter,

1422
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:54,500
his father will cry and fall on his chest,

1423
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:58,200
no no!

1424
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:01,100
Not me!

1425
02:01:08,300 --> 02:01:09,600
This has to happen!

1426
02:01:09,600 --> 02:01:12,200
He was connected to underworld!

1427
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:18,300
But where is Rajeev and Mami!

1428
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:23,600
Maybe they didn't even know yet!

1429
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:26,800
Ghungroo Mama! Is not anymore with us!

1430
02:01:40,900 --> 02:01:42,900
Lucky!

1431
02:01:52,300 --> 02:01:54,300
Lucky!

1432
02:01:54,700 --> 02:01:56,700
Lucky talk to me!

1433
02:01:57,600 --> 02:01:59,600
Lucky! Talk to me!

1434
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:02,600
Lucky please talk to me!

1435
02:02:03,300 --> 02:02:05,800
What was missing in our love?

1436
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:09,500
Lucky my son!

1437
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:24,400
Uncle!

1438
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:25,600
You can't see him!

1439
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:27,600
Why can't I see him?

1440
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:31,900
Because this was Lucky's last wish!

1441
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:34,700
Last wish!

1442
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:37,300
But why he said like that?

1443
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:39,300
Sir I tell you,

1444
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:43,600
only a person can answer this question,
who was lucky himself!

1445
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:45,500
Sir can we lie to you?

1446
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:47,700
Sir don't you believe us?

1447
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:04,800
He's here!

1448
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:18,000
You uncle is very great!

1449
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:21,100
He took all our troubles to himself!

1450
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:23,300
Look there!

1451
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Uncle!

1452
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:30,100
Uncle!

1453
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:33,200
Control!

1454
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:36,100
Why is he calling my son Uncle?

1455
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:38,700
No he's calling you Uncle!

1456
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:43,700
And why is he crying this much?

1457
02:03:43,700 --> 02:03:46,100
Because he became a (Biru)good friend
of Lucky

1458
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:47,300
Biru?

1459
02:03:47,300 --> 02:03:48,400
You can call it Best friends!

1460
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:49,200
I just make him understand!

1461
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:50,900
I just make him understand!

1462
02:03:50,900 --> 02:03:52,000
Rajeev!

1463
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
No no!

1464
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:56,100
He's alive!

1465
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:57,700
Who's alive?

1466
02:03:57,700 --> 02:03:59,700
Lucky is alive!

1467
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:03,300
Lucky is alive in our hearts!

1468
02:04:11,300 --> 02:04:13,300
You uncle is alive!

1469
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:15,400
Lucky!!
Where is he?

1470
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,300
He's hiding somewhere here!

1471
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:21,400
Who?
Lucky!

1472
02:04:37,700 --> 02:04:39,700
Uddday!!
Yes sir!

1473
02:04:40,700 --> 02:04:42,800
Why is this logs falling?

1474
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:47,600
Now the wood is
asking for dead body!

1475
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:49,800
Hey Ram!

1476
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:51,700
Control!

1477
02:04:51,700 --> 02:04:53,700
Side please!

1478
02:04:55,300 --> 02:04:57,300
Mami please careful!

1479
02:05:12,700 --> 02:05:14,700
Don't you feel ashamed?

1480
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:20,500
You were going to perform his funeral,
without even telling me!

1481
02:05:24,700 --> 02:05:27,300
At least today let me cry!

1482
02:05:28,300 --> 02:05:31,400
My life got ruined!

1483
02:05:31,700 --> 02:05:34,500
Why is she breaking her bangles?

1484
02:05:35,900 --> 02:05:37,000
Who is she?

1485
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
She is the wife of dead body!

1486
02:05:39,100 --> 02:05:40,200
Wife of dead body!

1487
02:05:40,300 --> 02:05:41,800
But when did Lucky got married?

1488
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:42,900
And why didn't he tell me!

1489
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:45,400
Maybe this secret also gone
away with Lucky!

1490
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:48,800
But I think Rajeev must know about this!

1491
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:50,500
Rajeev now you tell him,

1492
02:05:50,500 --> 02:05:52,500
what should I tell him?

1493
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:55,600
What should I tell...

1494
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:57,100
what should I tell...

1495
02:05:57,100 --> 02:06:00,900
that... this girl is from good background!

1496
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,000
And lucky and her both got married,

1497
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:10,100
and the girl's parent asked for one condition,

1498
02:06:10,700 --> 02:06:14,400
that the boys' father, means you have to leave,
job for the underworld,

1499
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:18,800
or else they both can't meet after the marriage too,

1500
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,100
what more good I can say?

1501
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:23,300
Alright that's good!

1502
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Come let's go,

1503
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:28,300
yes Sir!

1504
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:40,700
Where are you taking me?

1505
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:43,800
Uncle Ji, out fast,

1506
02:07:04,700 --> 02:07:06,400
when you came?

1507
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:08,900
I was the first one came here!

1508
02:07:09,900 --> 02:07:12,500
You were crying, over my chest,

1509
02:07:12,600 --> 02:07:14,600
over your chest!

1510
02:07:15,100 --> 02:07:16,500
No one can remember, in grief,

1511
02:07:16,500 --> 02:07:19,500
that whose crying over whose chest?

1512
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
He's alive!

1513
02:07:30,100 --> 02:07:32,100
Look Ishiqa!
He's alive!

1514
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:38,700
It's called true love!

1515
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:46,400
She gone mad, in Lucky's love!

1516
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:48,900
Who Lucky?

1517
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:50,400
Uncle Ji!

1518
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:52,400
Uncle Ji!

1519
02:07:53,100 --> 02:07:55,500
Please lighten up the fire,

1520
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:28,200
Lucky!

1521
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:35,400
How this all occurred?
Lucky what happened?

1522
02:08:35,400 --> 02:08:36,500
Its' a long story!

1523
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:38,200
Dad, please save me!

1524
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:40,200
The all are dogs!

1525
02:08:40,900 --> 02:08:44,500
First they shot me, than also
tried to burn me,

1526
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:47,100
they tried to burn you son,
Dad!

1527
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:55,600
Lucky!

1528
02:09:02,600 --> 02:09:04,600
Welcome!

1529
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:09,600
Welcome my friend!

1530
02:09:09,600 --> 02:09:11,600
Welcome!

1531
02:09:14,100 --> 02:09:16,200
RDX

1532
02:09:17,100 --> 02:09:20,300
Ranveer Dhanraj Xaka!

1533
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:24,100
Second name for terror and death!

1534
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:28,100
You tried to burn my son alive!

1535
02:09:28,700 --> 02:09:30,000
Sir we didn't knew, that

1536
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:32,100
your son is hiding in the woods,

1537
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:34,200
is that a place to hide?

1538
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:39,300
Sir would we lie to you?

1539
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:41,700
Sir don't you believe in us?

1540
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:55,100
Don't you even take out the
words, believe and faith from your mouth...

1541
02:09:55,400 --> 02:09:58,500
this all happened due to me,
and my love,

1542
02:09:58,500 --> 02:10:00,400
I'm the one to be punished!

1543
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:01,500
They don't deserve that!

1544
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:03,800
Punish is already decided,

1545
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:07,400
you guys played a game with us,

1546
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:10,700
now we are going to
play game with you,

1547
02:10:10,700 --> 02:10:12,700
Passing the parcel,

1548
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:16,000
One have to sing a song on
which hands the parcel is

1549
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,900
...being held after music is
off. Isn't it the same game?

1550
02:10:18,900 --> 02:10:21,200
Yes... same... same... same...

1551
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:24,800
Err! RDX brother me and your
Bhabhi... Oh! Sorry... Sorry...

1552
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:26,500
- Say Namaste to him.
- Namsete.

1553
02:10:26,500 --> 02:10:28,700
- You are an expert.
- But we aren't.

1554
02:10:28,700 --> 02:10:33,100
- A rule has been changed in it.
- Have to dance along with the song.

1555
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:36,500
- We know the variation.
- When the music goes off

1556
02:10:36,500 --> 02:10:42,700
Whoever hold this parcel he'll be drop
off in this 1000 miles deep trench.

1557
02:11:08,900 --> 02:11:11,200
Sir, your man sir.

1558
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:13,200
Your man black panther.

1559
02:11:13,900 --> 02:11:16,500
Who told you to play this game?

1560
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:18,300
- This monk.
- No... No...

1561
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:19,100
Shut up.

1562
02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:23,300
- Sorry... Sorry sir.
- Rules are Rules my friend.

1563
02:11:24,100 --> 02:11:26,200
I can't give my words.

1564
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:31,000
You'll have you give up your life.

1565
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:53,400
Err! According to your
information nobody had been here.

1566
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:55,600
But party is on over here.

1567
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:00,000
Sir now what can we do?

1568
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:03,300
- We'll do for what we are here?
- But sir there are so many people up there.

1569
02:12:03,300 --> 02:12:06,200
Err! All of them are criminals
and rewards is on everybody.

1570
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:09,200
Do one thing push this
house in the trench.

1571
02:12:09,200 --> 02:12:12,600
Then we'll see how
much reward we'll win.

1572
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:56,700
- Sir.
- Lucky.

1573
02:12:57,200 --> 02:12:58,600
Are you crazy?

1574
02:12:58,600 --> 02:13:02,800
He wasn't passing it over to save his
love that's why I snatch it from his hand.

1575
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:05,800
But you switch off the
music at the same time Dad.

1576
02:13:05,800 --> 02:13:07,800
This isn't not fare.

1577
02:13:07,900 --> 02:13:10,600
Ghungroo-Ji now what
RDX-Saab will do?

1578
02:13:10,600 --> 02:13:13,500
No what else he would do? He
said that rules are rules?

1579
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:14,200
- Isn't it.
- Yes... Yes... Yes...

1580
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:19,600
Correct Ghungroo-saith. RDX-Saab is known in all
over the underworld just because of his justice.

1581
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:20,900
The justice has been done then done.

1582
02:13:20,900 --> 02:13:23,800
Do you know that RDX-Saab never
changed his words till today.

1583
02:13:23,800 --> 02:13:25,100
He wouldn't change even today.

1584
02:13:25,100 --> 02:13:27,400
But consider that changed
because of the child then

1585
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:29,600
...how much disgrace would be
faced in the underworld?

1586
02:13:29,600 --> 02:13:33,800
Any world brother but all the
life has been passed to earn the name.

1587
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:36,600
But a instance is
enough to lose the name.

1588
02:13:36,600 --> 02:13:40,000
And the parcel which is in Lucky's
hand, this is the same instance.

1589
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,400
Parcel... Parcel... Parcel...

1590
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:47,400
Sir if you want to change
your decision then change

1591
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:51,400
...it, we can understand he's
your son. He's your blood.

1592
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:53,700
Bhai nobody will tell
anything to anybody.

1593
02:13:53,700 --> 02:13:55,600
Don't tell, means?

1594
02:13:55,600 --> 02:13:57,700
No... No... Nobody tell or
don't tell, such like that

1595
02:13:57,700 --> 02:13:59,800
...cheating is being started
in the game so I'll not play.

1596
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:02,900
- I'm leaving.
- Justice will be done.

1597
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:07,300
I'll do the justice.

1598
02:14:08,500 --> 02:14:16,100
I know if I'll forgive the life of my son
then I'll be disgraced very badly in underworld.

1599
02:14:19,300 --> 02:14:25,100
But infamy would then occur, when
a person will live among you people?

1600
02:14:45,900 --> 02:14:48,800
How do you cut it? It's half collapse.

1601
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:51,500
- It'll collapse.
- If it'll not then?

1602
02:14:51,500 --> 02:14:54,100
- Err! Run.
- Err! Run... Run...

1603
02:14:56,200 --> 02:14:59,300
- Babloo.
- Help.

1604
02:14:59,300 --> 02:15:01,300
Help.

1605
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:04,200
Help me.

1606
02:15:04,300 --> 02:15:06,300
Help.

1607
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:25,500
Err! That side.

1608
02:15:25,500 --> 02:15:27,400
Go that side.

1609
02:15:27,400 --> 02:15:29,200
Oh God!

1610
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:31,400
- Hemeash.
- What is this?

1611
02:15:41,100 --> 02:15:42,000
Leave my hand.

1612
02:15:42,100 --> 02:15:43,700
Leave my hand.

1613
02:15:43,700 --> 02:15:45,700
Leave my hand.

1614
02:15:46,900 --> 02:15:49,800
It's collapsing towards this side.

1615
02:15:54,300 --> 02:15:59,700
Err! Don't run here and there you
people will collapse the house.

1616
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:03,300
Brother thank you,
take care of your Bhabhi.

1617
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:05,300
Don't worry.

1618
02:16:09,200 --> 02:16:11,200
Err! Come in the center.

1619
02:16:19,900 --> 02:16:21,900
Being bitten.

1620
02:16:27,500 --> 02:16:29,700
This side... This side...

1621
02:16:32,600 --> 02:16:34,600
Come to my arms.

1622
02:16:35,100 --> 02:16:39,800
- Majnoo take care of your Bhabhi.
- Yes... Yes... Yes...

1623
02:16:42,900 --> 02:16:45,300
Come here, I'll do something.

1624
02:16:45,300 --> 02:16:48,300
I'll hit. I'll hit you.

1625
02:16:48,300 --> 02:16:52,100
- Majnoo.
- I was just breaking the bowl sir.

1626
02:16:52,600 --> 02:16:57,300
- I'll kill you if you touch her.
- Come in to the center.

1627
02:16:57,300 --> 02:17:01,300
All of you come in to
the center. In the center.

1628
02:17:02,500 --> 02:17:04,200
Lucky I'm coming.

1629
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:07,200
Mamaji don't go back,
come in the center.

1630
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:08,900
Sanjana that side, go towards that side.

1631
02:17:08,900 --> 02:17:11,300
- I'm unable to move.
- Stop.

1632
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:14,500
Take care of your head.

1633
02:17:16,400 --> 02:17:19,300
Dad, he rips my head off.

1634
02:17:25,300 --> 02:17:27,800
All stand in the center.

1635
02:17:27,800 --> 02:17:29,900
All stand in the center.

1636
02:18:21,600 --> 02:18:24,000
What are you doing you idiot?

1637
02:18:26,900 --> 02:18:29,300
Are you gonna be mad? Are you mad?

1638
02:18:29,300 --> 02:18:31,300
Oh my God.

1639
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:35,500
Found it, I found to kill the bees.

1640
02:18:38,300 --> 02:18:40,300
Spray on me too.

1641
02:18:42,400 --> 02:18:44,400
Here, here, here.

1642
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:50,200
Oh God. I can't see, I'm blind.

1643
02:18:50,400 --> 02:18:52,400
What you spray on me?

1644
02:18:54,900 --> 02:18:56,300
My eyes are burning.

1645
02:18:56,300 --> 02:18:57,300
Wear this.

1646
02:18:57,300 --> 02:18:58,800
Wear this then you will feel good.

1647
02:18:58,800 --> 02:19:02,900
If you cover your eyes
then how you will see him?

1648
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:10,500
Uday Bro.

1649
02:19:10,500 --> 02:19:14,700
Listen to me, destroy this
RDX or throw it in valley.

1650
02:19:14,700 --> 02:19:17,000
If he gets saved then we will not.

1651
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
Who is speaking?

1652
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:22,400
I'm Bajro Bahi speaking.

1653
02:19:22,400 --> 02:19:23,600
You are lying.

1654
02:19:23,600 --> 02:19:26,200
Sir, your Bajro is here, here.

1655
02:19:29,100 --> 02:19:31,400
What is happening here?

1656
02:19:31,800 --> 02:19:35,100
No one will survive.
We all are ruined

1657
02:19:41,400 --> 02:19:43,400
- Sanjna, let's go, hurry up.
- But Rajiv you.

1658
02:19:43,400 --> 02:19:45,900
You don't worry about me.
Just let's go. Go forward.

1659
02:19:45,900 --> 02:19:47,100
Nephew.

1660
02:19:47,100 --> 02:19:50,600
I'm your blood relative.
When will be my number?

1661
02:19:50,600 --> 02:19:52,100
Sanjna slowly.

1662
02:19:52,100 --> 02:19:54,700
Where are you?
- In matter of Ishika, we all will die.

1663
02:19:54,700 --> 02:19:57,200
If everyone dies, okay with me but...

1664
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:59,200
Kill everyone.

1665
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:02,000
Does my number will come?
After falling of the house?

1666
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Get aside.

1667
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Easy.

1668
02:20:19,500 --> 02:20:21,500
Easy.

1669
02:20:33,800 --> 02:20:38,700
Daddy. Daddy save me daddy.

1670
02:20:39,100 --> 02:20:41,100
Somebody save my son.

1671
02:20:44,900 --> 02:20:50,100
- Somebody save my brother please.
- Someone Please save my son.

1672
02:20:50,100 --> 02:20:52,100
Rajiv?

1673
02:20:54,200 --> 02:20:55,800
Rajiv. Stop.

1674
02:20:55,800 --> 02:20:57,800
Rajiv, come back.

1675
02:21:01,700 --> 02:21:03,700
- Rajiv?
- Stop him.

1676
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:10,000
Rajiv.

1677
02:21:10,100 --> 02:21:11,800
Rajiv, don't do the madness.

1678
02:21:11,900 --> 02:21:17,000
You have everything from God
like, money and fame. Rajiv stop.

1679
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:20,600
Help me dad.

1680
02:21:20,600 --> 02:21:22,600
Daddy.

1681
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:53,400
If he will get punish of my sins
then I'll never forgive myself.

1682
02:21:53,400 --> 02:21:54,200
What you mean?

1683
02:21:54,200 --> 02:21:58,100
I shoot the bullet for him.

1684
02:21:59,100 --> 02:22:01,700
But he took this crime on his head.

1685
02:22:01,700 --> 02:22:04,200
So I'll not face any problem.

1686
02:22:14,900 --> 02:22:16,900
Towards the door.

1687
02:22:49,700 --> 02:22:53,100
No, no Sanjna no.

1688
02:23:04,300 --> 02:23:06,300
I want to die.

1689
02:23:06,700 --> 02:23:07,700
Sanjna.

1690
02:23:07,700 --> 02:23:09,600
Rajiv you cheated me.
- Sanjna

1691
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:11,800
You betrayed me.
- Sanjna.

1692
02:23:11,900 --> 02:23:15,900
I never believe you and
I'll never forgive you.

1693
02:23:25,800 --> 02:23:27,800
What Happen?

1694
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:36,200
Sanjna, why you hit me?

1695
02:23:46,600 --> 02:23:54,900
Rajiv, Evil is always
small in front of good.

1696
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:58,900
You win the heart of RDX.

1697
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Ask, what you want?

1698
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:04,000
You also leave this world of crime.

1699
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Their is nothing in it.

1700
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
World need love.

1701
02:24:08,300 --> 02:24:09,500
Not hate.

1702
02:24:09,500 --> 02:24:12,800
Decorate this whole city like bride.

1703
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:14,900
For what?

1704
02:24:14,900 --> 02:24:21,600
For this that I'll arrange the
marriage of Rajiv and Sanjna.

1705
02:24:24,600 --> 02:24:26,600
Is your leg okay sir?

1706
02:24:28,900 --> 02:24:34,200
- Do the same for us.
- We lost in love.

1707
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:39,400
That's ok but first
introduce your brides with me.

1708
02:24:42,100 --> 02:24:44,700
What? Buy one and get one free.

1709
02:24:44,900 --> 02:24:46,900
Hey, lover.

1710
02:24:47,500 --> 02:24:49,600
Why you are holding
the hand of your Bhabhi.

1711
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:54,500
I don't like this kind of jokes Uday
Bahi. Leave the hand of your Bhabhi.

1712
02:24:54,500 --> 02:24:55,600
What? I'm bullshitting.

1713
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:57,700
- You are holding hand of your Bhabhi.
- She is my Ishika.

1714
02:24:57,700 --> 02:24:58,900
She is my Ishika.

1715
02:24:58,900 --> 02:25:00,200
Hey Ishika, tell him.

1716
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:01,100
Ishika, tell me?

1717
02:25:01,100 --> 02:25:02,700
- You tell me.
- I'm telling you.

1718
02:25:02,700 --> 02:25:04,600
Rajiv, tell them.

1719
02:25:04,600 --> 02:25:07,000
Actually what ever
happen... wait a minute.

1720
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:11,700
These both sir...
Sanjan run, Sanjna run from here.

1721
02:25:12,400 --> 02:25:13,600
Why they run away?

1722
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:15,600
I'll come back.

1723
02:25:16,300 --> 02:25:19,000
Uday Bahi, why they are running?

1724
02:25:28,200 --> 02:25:29,700
Such big game.

1725
02:25:29,700 --> 02:25:31,200
With us.

1726
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:34,300
I'm now a good person but
I'll not forgive Rajiv.

1727
02:25:34,300 --> 02:25:36,300
If you forgive him then
I'll not forgive you.

1728
02:25:36,300 --> 02:25:42,000
You have everything from God like,
money, respect and fame. Rajiv...
