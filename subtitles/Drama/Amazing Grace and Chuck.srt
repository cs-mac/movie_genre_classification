00:00:00,315 --> 00:00:02,948
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a
few things you might need to know:

2
00:00:02,949 --> 00:00:03,932
I have nothing to do with

3
00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:05,534
Alexei Volkoff-- I
haven't seen him in years.

4
00:00:05,535 --> 00:00:08,882
Then why does he pay for the manor
that you live in? Because I'm his daughter.

5
00:00:09,783 --> 00:00:11,471
My father never gave me any key.

6
00:00:11,472 --> 00:00:12,825
Yes, sweetheart, he did.

7
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:15,393
When you were young--
a token of his affection.

8
00:00:15,477 --> 00:00:18,599
Your whole life your
father's been grooming you.

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,619
You are his succession plan.

10
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:04,004
I give up.

11
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:05,798
Strange reaction.

12
00:01:07,494 --> 00:01:10,830
Most people show a bit more enthusiasm

13
00:01:10,898 --> 00:01:13,518
when they receive a gift.

14
00:01:14,602 --> 00:01:16,204
Sorry. Who are you?

15
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:17,740
My name is Riley.

16
00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:20,674
I'm your father's lawyer.

17
00:01:20,742 --> 00:01:23,510
You father

18
00:01:23,578 --> 00:01:26,830
left a letter for you.

19
00:01:31,035 --> 00:01:33,387
"My dearest daughter Vivian,

20
00:01:33,454 --> 00:01:35,656
"as you know,

21
00:01:35,723 --> 00:01:37,991
"I've met an untimely demise...

22
00:01:38,059 --> 00:01:39,993
Sorry. "I..."

23
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:41,695
What are you doing?

24
00:01:41,763 --> 00:01:44,765
He specified that I
read the letter in his voice.

25
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:48,368
He thought it would
make you feel comfortable.

26
00:01:48,436 --> 00:01:49,570
Please stop.

27
00:01:49,637 --> 00:01:53,574
I spent several weeks perfecting this.

28
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:55,542
But fine.

29
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,444
Uh...

30
00:01:57,512 --> 00:02:01,797
"I'm sorry I was never much of a father.

31
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:03,273
"If I could do it over again,

32
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:07,721
"I would trade my entire
empire for another moment with you..."

33
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:14,058
"but we can't relive the past,

34
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:16,857
"which is why I have
groomed you for the future.

35
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:18,912
"That card in my safe

36
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:22,517
will help you
rebuild Volkoff Industries..."

37
00:02:22,603 --> 00:02:25,138
Mr. Riley, I'm well aware that my father

38
00:02:25,206 --> 00:02:29,543
now wants me to take
over his evil corporation.

39
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,578
So how can I say no?

40
00:02:31,646 --> 00:02:33,080
Hmm.

41
00:02:33,147 --> 00:02:35,532
No.

42
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:37,384
Nobody ever said no to your father.

43
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:40,520
Than I'll be the first to do it.

44
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:41,588
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:41,656 --> 00:02:43,457
I can't allow that.

46
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:47,794
Now perhaps you'd
like to rethink your answer.

47
00:03:06,748 --> 00:03:09,382
Okay, roses or orchids?

48
00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:11,752
Uh, I don't know.

49
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,186
Uh, roses?

50
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:14,571
What do you think?

51
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:18,492
I think that flowers can
really set the tone of a wedding.

52
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:20,293
you know, roses are-- are beautiful,

53
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:22,028
they're classic, they're passionate.

54
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:23,764
Not very whimsical.

55
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:25,699
And that's good?

56
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:27,534
If it's what you want.

57
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:29,503
Uh, okay.

58
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,572
Uh, well... Orchids?

59
00:03:32,623 --> 00:03:35,575
Sorry. Sarah...

60
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:37,210
I'm sorry. I-I just--

61
00:03:37,261 --> 00:03:38,912
I don't have a
strong feeling either way.

62
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,148
I just don't think that
maybe I'm cut out for this.

63
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:42,549
What if you just make the choices?

64
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:44,718
Okay, you know what?

65
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:46,103
Maybe-- maybe this girly stuff

66
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:49,139
is a little outside your comfort zone.

67
00:03:49,223 --> 00:03:50,957
I will tell you that, at some point,

68
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:53,427
every bride feels a
little overwhelmed with this stuff.

69
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:55,228
I totally did.

70
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:57,664
But there was a
moment where that all changed.

71
00:03:57,732 --> 00:04:00,300
I remember I had gone
to pick up our wedding bands

72
00:04:00,368 --> 00:04:02,803
and I finally held them in my hands.

73
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,738
And it all just became so real.

74
00:04:04,806 --> 00:04:05,939
I was getting married

75
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:11,111
to the man that I
love, for the rest of my life.

76
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:14,014
And then I just broke down crying,

77
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:16,016
which sounds ridiculous right now.

78
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,284
Yeah, a little.

79
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:18,819
A lot.

80
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:20,687
But it was a turning point, you know.

81
00:04:20,755 --> 00:04:24,958
From that moment on,
everything became magical.

82
00:04:25,026 --> 00:04:27,727
It was my wedding.

83
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:30,263
I don't know when and
I don't know where, Sarah,

84
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:33,800
but I promise you,
it's going to happen to you.

85
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,374
You know what?

86
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:42,509
New apartment, I'm
going to go no television.

87
00:04:43,177 --> 00:04:44,845
It will be very liberating.

88
00:04:48,216 --> 00:04:50,083
Kidding. I'm totally kidding.

89
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:51,818
72 inches, dude. Bam.

90
00:04:51,869 --> 00:04:54,051
I was honestly about
to smack you right now.

91
00:04:55,456 --> 00:04:58,508
So how is the
apartment hunting going, anyway?

92
00:04:58,593 --> 00:05:01,728
It's uh... Oh, man, it
couldn't be going better.

93
00:05:01,796 --> 00:05:03,630
I found a place. A little pricey.

94
00:05:03,698 --> 00:05:06,199
So I'm looking for a roommate right now.

95
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:07,834
Well, that shouldn't be
a problem, right? I hope not.

96
00:05:07,885 --> 00:05:09,402
And you know what, in the meantime,

97
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,170
it's kind of nice being at my mom's.

98
00:05:11,222 --> 00:05:14,024
Buddy, I gotta say,
I'm, uh, I'm a little relieved.

99
00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:15,942
Chuck, this is needed on my part, okay?

100
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:20,113
I am growing mentally
and emotionally, physically--

101
00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:21,615
not so much physically.

102
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:24,217
But some people are
saying that I'm acting taller.

103
00:05:26,237 --> 00:05:28,038
Uh,I gotta get down to Castle.

104
00:05:28,122 --> 00:05:30,857
Buddy, I'm so glad that
everything's going so well.

105
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:32,158
You're killing it.

106
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,454
Have a great day.

107
00:05:34,455 --> 00:05:36,913
See you soon.

108
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,250
Hey, son.

109
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:41,418
Sleep okay last night?

110
00:05:41,502 --> 00:05:43,920
No. No, I did not.

111
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:47,090
Those cats outside
the window are just so loud.

112
00:05:47,174 --> 00:05:48,174
They gave me nightmares.

113
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:50,610
Yeah, cats.

114
00:05:50,678 --> 00:05:52,679
Just a heads up-- Mm-hmm.

115
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:55,382
those cats are having
a romantic dinner tonight.

116
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:57,551
And there might be more cat fighting

117
00:05:57,618 --> 00:06:00,020
after dinner ends.

118
00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:01,571
Unless your mom eats too much.

119
00:06:01,656 --> 00:06:05,058
Listen, I don't want to
think about you and my mom doing...

120
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:08,261
making a... slipping and...

121
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:10,030
Son, when you move into the forest,

122
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:12,699
you can't complain that the
wildlife is making too much noise.

123
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:14,634
It's only natural.

124
00:06:14,702 --> 00:06:15,669
And beautiful.

125
00:06:16,437 --> 00:06:17,370
And frequent.

126
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:18,905
I need my own place. Yes, you do.

127
00:06:20,675 --> 00:06:22,676
So then you went to
Volkoff's headquarters

128
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:25,445
and you were attacked? Yes.

129
00:06:25,513 --> 00:06:26,763
I shouldn't have gone to Moscow.

130
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:28,265
I don't know what I was thinking.

131
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:29,950
It's okay. You're safe here.

132
00:06:30,017 --> 00:06:31,268
Now, this man Riley--

133
00:06:31,352 --> 00:06:33,219
he wants you to
rebuild your father's empire?

134
00:06:33,287 --> 00:06:34,287
Yes.

135
00:06:34,355 --> 00:06:35,722
But I told him I don't want

136
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,390
to have anything to do with my father.

137
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,160
Did he happen to say what his
plan for rebuilding Volkoff was?

138
00:06:40,227 --> 00:06:43,063
I think this may have
something to do with it.

139
00:06:53,908 --> 00:06:55,475
We need to talk to Beckman.

140
00:06:55,543 --> 00:06:59,012
So Volkoff has all of his
money in the First Bank of Macau.

141
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,347
We need to freeze those funds.

142
00:07:00,414 --> 00:07:01,648
We do.

143
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:04,584
But the First Bank of
Macau is no easy target.

144
00:07:04,652 --> 00:07:06,953
It's really operated by
the Guan Yi Crime Syndicate. 

145
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:09,839
The guards are mercenaries.

146
00:07:09,924 --> 00:07:13,093
We've lost agents
inside of there before.

147
00:07:13,144 --> 00:07:15,795
But we've never had an
account holder working with us.

148
00:07:15,863 --> 00:07:18,331
That makes Vivian the perfect asset.

149
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,233
With her help,
we'll be able to get through

150
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:21,368
the bank's security

151
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:23,937
and access her
father's account. Um, General,

152
00:07:24,005 --> 00:07:29,342
I'm not so sure
that Vivian is really built

153
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,045
for this sort of mission, you know.

154
00:07:32,113 --> 00:07:34,313
Not to mention the
fact that she was pretty clear

155
00:07:34,365 --> 00:07:36,783
about never wanting
to see her father again.

156
00:07:36,851 --> 00:07:38,785
Well, it's your job to change all that.

157
00:07:38,853 --> 00:07:40,787
You're a spy, she's an asset.

158
00:07:40,855 --> 00:07:42,522
If this mission is going to work,

159
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,508
you need to turn
that girl into a Volkoff.

No, Morgan, don't

Let it be a pleasant surprise.

165
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:41,363
Morgan.

166
00:08:41,415 --> 00:08:43,549
Hey buddy. You look sharp.

167
00:08:43,634 --> 00:08:46,219
Listen, um, you're
obviously a worldly fellow.

168
00:08:46,303 --> 00:08:49,038
I was wondering if you
could settle a little debate

169
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:50,089
betwixt us.

170
00:08:50,173 --> 00:08:51,307
Where do you think

171
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,576
would be the best place to meet ladies--

172
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:57,413
a Renaissance Fair--
right? Or a methadone clinic?

173
00:08:57,482 --> 00:08:59,149
It's okay if the ladies are really ugly.

174
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:01,084
Really? I don't... I
don't... a Renaissance Fair.

175
00:09:01,836 --> 00:09:03,086
Okay, interesting.

176
00:09:03,137 --> 00:09:04,854
Next question--
can we have two weeks off

177
00:09:04,922 --> 00:09:06,289
to to go a Renaissance Fair?

178
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:07,290
Not a chance.

179
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:08,625
See?

180
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:09,893
Look, I don't have time to discuss it.

181
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,194
I'm in the middle of a housing crisis

182
00:09:11,262 --> 00:09:12,896
and I need to find a place now.

183
00:09:12,963 --> 00:09:14,664
Really? Dude, dude.

184
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:17,467
We have an extra room
in our apartment-slash-van.

185
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:19,069
So how about this?

186
00:09:19,136 --> 00:09:22,972
A place to statay in
exchange, for say, one week off.

187
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,808
Hmm.

188
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,243
Huh? No.

189
00:09:27,311 --> 00:09:30,246
Manager to register seven, please.

190
00:09:30,314 --> 00:09:31,564
Okay, I'm not... I'm done here.

191
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:33,016
Thank you for the offer,

192
00:09:33,084 --> 00:09:34,084
but no thank you.

193
00:09:34,151 --> 00:09:35,685
"Slash-van."

194
00:09:35,753 --> 00:09:37,854
See yourselves out, please.

195
00:09:37,905 --> 00:09:40,657
He's a heartbreaker; a soul crusher.

196
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:45,194
I'm going to pin that
guy down and shave his beard.

197
00:09:46,547 --> 00:09:47,997
Hmm.

198
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:50,934
It looks like Morgan's
potential roommates are meeting him here.

199
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:53,887
Morgan won't let us
go to the Renaissance Fair,

200
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:58,375
we'll bring the Renaissance Fair to us.

201
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,745
I have no idea what
you're doing right now.

202
00:10:02,613 --> 00:10:05,331
So you want me to help
you break into my father's bank.

203
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,983
Absolutely not.

204
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:09,752
I've had way too many
guns pointed at me recently.

205
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,722
We'll be there to
protect you the entire time.

206
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,224
Look, most years I
saw my father maybe once.

207
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:18,094
The longest conversation
we've ever had is ten minutes.

208
00:10:18,162 --> 00:10:19,162
I get that, I do.

209
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:21,164
Believe me, I understand.

210
00:10:21,231 --> 00:10:23,116
So your father was a criminal mastermind

211
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,734
who forgot your
last five birthdays, too?

212
00:10:24,802 --> 00:10:26,402
No, um...

213
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,606
but he did leave me
when I was 13 years old.

214
00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:31,574
I'm sorry.

215
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:32,775
It's okay.

216
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:34,744
You know, for the longest time,

217
00:10:34,812 --> 00:10:37,180
all I ever wanted to do
was ask him the same questions

218
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:39,415
that I know are swirling
around in your head right now.

219
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:40,783
Why'd you leave?

220
00:10:40,851 --> 00:10:44,020
Why didn't you ever even
make an attempt to contact me?

221
00:10:44,088 --> 00:10:47,090
You ever get to ask him?

222
00:10:47,157 --> 00:10:48,625
Yeah.

223
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:52,228
And I learned that even
though my father wasn't around,

224
00:10:52,296 --> 00:10:55,098
it didn't mean he
wasn't thinking about me.

225
00:10:55,165 --> 00:10:58,534
Look, I don't know what you'll find out,

226
00:10:58,602 --> 00:11:00,637
but I can guarantee
you that if you help us,

227
00:11:00,704 --> 00:11:03,106
we can help you find
at least some of the answers

228
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:05,508
that you're looking for.

229
00:11:07,211 --> 00:11:08,378
When the thugs

230
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:11,364
running the bank
meet Volkoff's daughter,

231
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:13,116
they're gonna be
expecting someone intimidating.

232
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:17,170
And your current outfit
doesn't really scream "bad guy."

233
00:11:17,254 --> 00:11:19,756
I wasn't exactly
planning on infiltrating a bank

234
00:11:19,823 --> 00:11:21,290
when I got dressed this morning.

235
00:11:21,342 --> 00:11:23,159
Well, we can fix that. Smile.

236
00:11:26,096 --> 00:11:27,764
It's kind of like J. Crew for spies.

237
00:11:34,605 --> 00:11:38,341
- Wow.
- Yeah.

238
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:39,809
It's also got some really cool

239
00:11:39,877 --> 00:11:42,245
makeover features that
are built in, in case you want

240
00:11:42,312 --> 00:11:43,813
to do a full... Not that I've ever...

241
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:46,015
Anyway...

242
00:11:50,954 --> 00:11:52,355
Go ahead, try it on.

243
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,561
So, meet me in the
armory when she's done.

244
00:11:57,628 --> 00:12:00,347
Yeah. One sec, though. I
want to show you something.

245
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:04,034
What do you think?

246
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:05,836
It's a little formal for a bank job.

247
00:12:05,903 --> 00:12:08,405
You know what? You're
right, it is formal for a bank job.

248
00:12:08,473 --> 00:12:10,907
What do you think of it,
I don't know, for our wedding?

249
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:12,442
Oh! Oh, the wedding!

250
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,695
Yeah! Yeah, you'll look great in that.

251
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,613
Very, very handsome.

252
00:12:16,681 --> 00:12:18,048
What's going on?

253
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:19,750
What's wrong?
Something's wrong with you.

254
00:12:19,817 --> 00:12:21,485
'Cause you love me in a black tie.

255
00:12:21,552 --> 00:12:24,187
It's just that this
is not really my thing,

256
00:12:24,238 --> 00:12:26,556
and I feel like I'm
letting you guys down.

257
00:12:26,624 --> 00:12:27,858
You're not letting anybody down.

258
00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:31,228
Was that Casey?

259
00:12:31,295 --> 00:12:32,329
Yeah.

260
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:35,865
Casey! Hey! Casey!

261
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:37,367
Yo, what's going on?

262
00:12:37,418 --> 00:12:38,635
Nothing.

263
00:12:38,702 --> 00:12:40,253
Just getting a Hot Pocket.

264
00:12:40,338 --> 00:12:42,205
Oh. Love me some Fiesta Chicken, huh?

265
00:12:42,273 --> 00:12:44,174
The way the cheese and the chicken...?

266
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:47,044
What I meant was we
haven't seen you for a while.

267
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:48,945
You okay? I'm fine. Let's hook up later.

268
00:12:49,013 --> 00:12:50,113
We'll get facials and chat.

269
00:12:50,181 --> 00:12:51,681
Where are you going? We're shipping out

270
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:54,017
in a few hours.
Don't you need to get ready?

271
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:58,088
Actually, Beckman has me
working on a mission of my own.

272
00:12:58,156 --> 00:13:00,157
What mission would that be exactly?

273
00:13:00,224 --> 00:13:01,658
Can't really talk about it. Sorry.

274
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:05,862
But I hear you guys are
hitting the First Bank of Macau.

275
00:13:05,913 --> 00:13:08,048
Be careful.

276
00:13:16,974 --> 00:13:19,259
I'm here to heed
your call for a roommate!

277
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:21,078
I know, it's intimidating

278
00:13:21,145 --> 00:13:23,747
to be in the presence of a king.

279
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:26,733
You'll get used to it. Oh, also,

280
00:13:26,818 --> 00:13:28,068
I do dishes.

281
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:29,453
Is there anything else left

282
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,071
you'd like to tell me about yourself?

283
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:34,024
Well, my parents died in the plague.

284
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:37,411
Okay. Um, do you have any pets?

285
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:39,963
No, no pets.

286
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:41,798
I'm not a big pet guy.

287
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:42,632
Good to know.

288
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,034
I like to work in leather.

289
00:13:44,102 --> 00:13:47,037
You are gonna go
down on the top of the...

290
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:48,738
You may kiss the ring.

291
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,590
Okay.

292
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,478
Okay.

293
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:55,946
How...?

294
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:59,683
Look, I think there's been
some sort of misunderstanding.

295
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,270
I don't believe you're here
for the same ad that I put out.

296
00:14:03,354 --> 00:14:05,589
I don't know what the
hell ad you're talking about,

297
00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:07,307
but the Buy More is a delicate cover.

298
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:09,292
You need to shut down this now!

299
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,144
Casey, I have no
idea what happened, okay?

300
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:12,762
Look, I put out a simple ad

301
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,031
to find a roommate, and all
these weirdoes start showing up.

302
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:16,099
Chug, chug, chug...

303
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,786
Go, go! Go, weirdo, go!

304
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:23,106
Got it.

305
00:14:23,157 --> 00:14:25,442
Those idiots messed with my post.

306
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,628
I'll have good luck
getting a roommate now. Perfect.

307
00:14:28,713 --> 00:14:31,781
Wait a minute. I got it.

308
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:33,483
Casey, you have an extra room.

309
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:34,918
No, not even worth saying.

310
00:14:34,986 --> 00:14:37,287
Yeah, but think about
the possi... Think about the...

311
00:14:45,346 --> 00:14:47,497
Okay, Vivian, remember,
this place is highly dangerous.

312
00:14:47,565 --> 00:14:50,367
You need to act
like-- well, your father.

313
00:14:50,434 --> 00:14:52,169
Chuck will pose as your bodyguard.

314
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:54,037
I'll be like your
very own Kevin Costner.

315
00:14:54,105 --> 00:14:55,639
You'll present your account card

316
00:14:55,706 --> 00:14:57,207
to the bank manager, Guillermo Chan.

317
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:59,142
He will lead you both up to the vaults.

318
00:14:59,193 --> 00:15:00,510
Remember, the
vault is highly restricted.

319
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:03,613
Once we're in the
vault, you're gonna have to pass

320
00:15:03,664 --> 00:15:04,981
a pretty rigid verification process.

321
00:15:05,032 --> 00:15:06,983
I'm not good with tests.

322
00:15:07,051 --> 00:15:08,651
What happens if I don't pass it?

323
00:15:08,703 --> 00:15:10,287
Just, you know... pass.

324
00:15:10,354 --> 00:15:11,788
You'll be fine.

325
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,191
If you're ever at
a loss, just look to me

326
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:15,342
and I'll be right there.

327
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:17,627
Stay close.

328
00:15:26,187 --> 00:15:27,837
Can I help you?

329
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:30,106
I'm sorry, we aren't
accepting any new accounts.

330
00:15:30,174 --> 00:15:32,642
Miss Volkoff is
already an account holder.

331
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:35,345
Miss Volkoff?

332
00:15:36,948 --> 00:15:38,281
I wasn't aware

333
00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:39,816
this account had changed hands.

334
00:15:43,854 --> 00:15:44,988
Please come with me.

335
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:53,880
Account holders only.

336
00:15:53,965 --> 00:15:56,266
I am her Kevin Cost... bodyguard!

337
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:57,968
I am her bodyguard!

338
00:15:58,035 --> 00:15:59,252
It's okay.

339
00:16:02,506 --> 00:16:04,874
We'll find another
way to freeze the account.

340
00:16:04,926 --> 00:16:06,376
I'm getting you out of here.

341
00:16:06,427 --> 00:16:08,678
Chuck, you said
this might be my only way

342
00:16:08,729 --> 00:16:10,046
to learn about my dad.

343
00:16:10,097 --> 00:16:11,815
Yeah. Then I'm doing it.

344
00:16:31,502 --> 00:16:33,204
Security stopped me
from following Vivian.

345
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:34,756
Okay, which way did they take her?

346
00:16:34,823 --> 00:16:36,891
Main staircase.

347
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,827
Okay, there are
emergency stairs across the lobby,

348
00:16:39,895 --> 00:16:41,429
east wall. That should take you

349
00:16:41,497 --> 00:16:42,797
up to the vault level.

350
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:45,833
I'm gonna need a key card.

351
00:16:48,037 --> 00:16:49,771
Time to be a spy.

352
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:51,873
Hey, big fella.

353
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,508
Sorry about that earlier.

354
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,576
Little security faux-pas.

355
00:16:55,644 --> 00:16:57,562
the biz. I know because we're both in

356
00:16:57,646 --> 00:16:58,763
You know, the "security biz."

357
00:17:00,232 --> 00:17:02,950
My real concern is just
for Miss Volkoff's safety.

358
00:17:03,018 --> 00:17:05,453
I mean, how do we know
she's gonna be properly protected

359
00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:06,904
up there in that vault? She's safe.

360
00:17:06,989 --> 00:17:10,058
So you say. And I want
to believe you, I really do.

361
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,293
But what if someone were to break in?

362
00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:15,246
Perhaps, oh, I don't
know, a Kung Fu master?

363
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:16,297
A little of this

364
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:18,199
or one of these?

365
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:19,884
How about swooping it and pushing it?

366
00:17:20,969 --> 00:17:22,070
Okay!

367
00:17:22,137 --> 00:17:23,371
I believe ya!

368
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,891
I get it... Point taken. Point taken.

369
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:28,542
Chuck, what are you doing?

370
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:29,577
I'm a believer.

371
00:17:33,015 --> 00:17:35,566
Sarah, I'm in.

372
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:37,101
Oh, good. Okay.

373
00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:39,687
Where are we?

374
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:42,390
The vault level, Miss Volkoff.

375
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:44,392
Follow me.

376
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:54,302
What's going on?

377
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,839
Standard security procedure.

378
00:17:57,907 --> 00:18:00,742
Place your hand there, on the table.

379
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:02,911
Ow!

380
00:18:02,912 --> 00:18:05,264
Sorry. Please step back.

381
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:08,384
We needed a DNA sample

382
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:10,936
to make sure you
are who you say you are.

383
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,154
There should be no problem

384
00:18:12,222 --> 00:18:14,256
as long as you're telling us the truth

385
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:16,458
and no one has removed
you from your father's account.

386
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:35,009
Sarah, I'm on the vault level.

387
00:18:35,077 --> 00:18:36,177
No sign of Vivian.

388
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:37,645
Copy.

389
00:18:37,713 --> 00:18:40,365
There should be a
junction in the hallway to your east.

390
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:42,534
Copy. Moving east.

391
00:18:42,618 --> 00:18:44,552
Oh, no!

392
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,653
What? Stepping back. What?

393
00:18:45,704 --> 00:18:46,671
No, no, no, no,

394
00:18:46,755 --> 00:18:48,189
it's not you. You're fine.

395
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:50,592
I just a text from your
sister. She wants to go cake-tasting.

396
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:52,393
Cake-tasting. How awful.

397
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:56,548
Okay, you should see
two doors up ahead of you.

398
00:18:56,632 --> 00:19:00,787
Yep. Heading toward them
now, but don't change the subject.

399
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,356
Look, I know that this
wedding stuff is supposed

400
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:10,616
to be really fun, but I-I
just find it a little overwhelming,

401
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,415
you know, the cake and
the flowers, the venue and...

402
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:15,901
Well, maybe it would be
a little less overwhelming

403
00:19:15,985 --> 00:19:18,020
if you would, you
know, just pick one thing

404
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:20,155
to get excited about; ease your way in.

405
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:44,278
Sarah, hey, I just flashed.

406
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:45,913
They have servers down here,

407
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:47,415
a year ago. stolen from the Chinese Army

408
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:48,983
What do you think
they're using them for?

409
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:50,184
I have no idea.

410
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:52,286
But a bank wouldn't
use military-grade tech

411
00:19:52,354 --> 00:19:54,288
unless they were up
to something serious...

412
00:20:02,598 --> 00:20:05,266
Please state your name.

413
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:08,169
Vivian McArthur Volkoff.

414
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:11,973
What business
would you like to transact?

415
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,259
I would like to
access my father's account.

416
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:20,414
Are you working with
a law enforcement agency?

417
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:27,388
No.

418
00:20:36,164 --> 00:20:38,766
Vivian Volkoff...

419
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:40,401
You...

420
00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:42,270
have...

421
00:20:42,337 --> 00:20:44,238
passed our test.

422
00:20:44,306 --> 00:20:46,407
The account is yours.

423
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:48,175
Sorry for all of our extreme measures.

424
00:20:48,243 --> 00:20:51,712
You'll find subsequent visits
to be significantly less invasive.

425
00:20:51,763 --> 00:20:53,047
Here.

426
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:56,350
Your father's safe-deposit box.

427
00:20:56,918 --> 00:20:59,420
This was all he kept at this bank?

428
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:01,356
Your father once told me this contained

429
00:21:01,424 --> 00:21:02,590
his most prized possessions.

430
00:21:21,844 --> 00:21:23,945
What are you doing down here?

431
00:21:24,013 --> 00:21:28,049
You guys sure hide the
ATMs around here, don't you?

432
00:21:28,117 --> 00:21:29,200
Chuck, is everything okay?

433
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:30,518
Nothing I can't handle.

434
00:21:30,586 --> 00:21:32,020
Okay, I spoke too soon!

435
00:21:32,071 --> 00:21:34,756
I can't handle it! I need help!

436
00:21:34,824 --> 00:21:35,991
I'm on my way.

437
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:47,435
I'm afraid there's been a small problem.

438
00:21:47,503 --> 00:21:50,372
Your bodyguard was
found in a secure area.

439
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:55,377
I am... so sorry, Miss Volkoff.

440
00:22:02,918 --> 00:22:04,853
Were you trying to steal?

441
00:22:09,725 --> 00:22:11,609
I trusted you.

442
00:22:11,694 --> 00:22:13,161
This is what you do to me?

443
00:22:13,229 --> 00:22:14,729
To my reputation?

444
00:22:14,797 --> 00:22:15,947
Please, Miss Volkoff.

445
00:22:16,032 --> 00:22:17,465
This isn't necessary.

446
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:18,633
This isn't your concern.

447
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:20,769
You haven't been lied to like I have.

448
00:22:22,405 --> 00:22:23,938
What I mean is...

449
00:22:24,006 --> 00:22:27,442
there is no need to do
this on bank property. Yes?

450
00:22:40,523 --> 00:22:42,357
I'll take it from here.

451
00:22:42,424 --> 00:22:43,825
Thank you.

452
00:22:43,893 --> 00:22:47,262
You can hand him
over to my head of security.

453
00:22:53,202 --> 00:22:56,204
Vivian's getting
pretty good at this, isn't she?

454
00:22:56,271 --> 00:22:58,206
Miss Volkoff.

455
00:22:58,273 --> 00:23:01,676
I'll admit I didn't see
the family resemblance at first.

456
00:23:01,744 --> 00:23:04,279
But now...

457
00:23:04,346 --> 00:23:06,781
I see your father in you.

458
00:23:12,044 --> 00:23:16,574
So there's no way this thing could be a
clue to where your father hid his funds? No.

459
00:23:16,641 --> 00:23:18,893
I mean, these are just... pictures.

460
00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:20,411
Of me.

461
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:22,480
So. Nothing on Volkoff's money.

462
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:24,048
Looks like we hit a dead end.

463
00:23:24,116 --> 00:23:25,583
Unless Langley uncovers something about

464
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,817
those servers that you saw.

465
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:32,390
Excuse me.

466
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:36,277
It's crazy.

467
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:38,329
I mean... I barely ever knew my father,

468
00:23:38,397 --> 00:23:39,780
and now I discover that he's been

469
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:41,248
watching me this whole time.

470
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,067
I feel like I deserve some answers.

471
00:23:43,135 --> 00:23:44,402
You do.

472
00:23:44,469 --> 00:23:46,170
At least you got to talk to your father.

473
00:23:46,238 --> 00:23:47,938
I'm never going to be able to do that.

474
00:23:49,908 --> 00:23:51,842
Maybe you will. What do you mean?

475
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,611
I thought the CIA had
him locked up somewhere.

476
00:23:53,678 --> 00:23:56,080
Yeah. But I am the CIA.

477
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:58,549
I can ask around, see
if we can set up a meeting.

478
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,984
Are you serious?

479
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:02,653
Yeah. Look, I know what
you're going through. I, I do.

480
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:04,722
And if you really
want to talk to your father,

481
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,089
I can do everything that I--

482
00:24:08,477 --> 00:24:10,761
Thank you.

483
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:12,863
You're welcome.

484
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:16,600
Hey. So what's the "wedding epiphany"?

485
00:24:16,651 --> 00:24:18,285
I just realized we have been going about

486
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,653
this wedding planning all wrong.

487
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:21,472
We have?

488
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,940
Yes! You don't build a wedding

489
00:24:22,991 --> 00:24:24,708
around flowers or the cake or the food.

490
00:24:24,776 --> 00:24:26,627
What do you build the wedding around?

491
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:28,245
Um...

492
00:24:28,296 --> 00:24:29,713
The weather?

493
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:31,332
The dress, Sarah.

494
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:34,151
You build the wedding around the dress.

495
00:24:34,219 --> 00:24:36,086
And I know you're not,
like, a typical wedding-dress girl,

496
00:24:36,154 --> 00:24:38,456
but I just thought that...
It seems like it could be fun.

497
00:24:38,523 --> 00:24:39,990
Really?

498
00:24:40,058 --> 00:24:42,626
Yeah. Yeah, I've been
looking for a way to ease into this,

499
00:24:42,677 --> 00:24:44,645
and I think this might be it.

500
00:24:44,729 --> 00:24:46,964
In fact, I'm going to go
do some research right now.

501
00:24:47,032 --> 00:24:48,866
Okay.

502
00:24:57,943 --> 00:25:00,544
Oh, God.

503
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:04,248
No.

504
00:25:08,787 --> 00:25:12,056
Maybe.

505
00:26:10,448 --> 00:26:13,017
Oh, my God.

506
00:26:13,084 --> 00:26:15,252
It's perfect.

507
00:26:26,097 --> 00:26:29,033
We're getting married.

508
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:32,903
Oh my God.

509
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:34,572
We're getting married?

510
00:26:38,677 --> 00:26:41,712
Pretty dress.

511
00:26:41,763 --> 00:26:42,780
I know.

512
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:48,452
Uh... might want to
get a new one, though.

513
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,454
Looks like this one's been on a mission.

514
00:26:53,725 --> 00:26:55,526
Oh.

515
00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:01,615
Hey, hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa.

516
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,635
I know what you two did to my ad.

517
00:27:04,703 --> 00:27:06,270
And guess what?

518
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:07,304
You owe me.

519
00:27:07,372 --> 00:27:09,306
We owe you?

520
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:10,958
You owe us.

521
00:27:11,042 --> 00:27:12,660
You would be nothing

522
00:27:12,744 --> 00:27:14,578
without us. You get that? Look.

523
00:27:14,646 --> 00:27:16,714
Look, I just need a
place to stay for tonight.

524
00:27:16,781 --> 00:27:18,248
And you said you had the room.

525
00:27:18,316 --> 00:27:19,817
Sorry, friend-o.

526
00:27:19,884 --> 00:27:21,251
Vacancy's been filled.

527
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,920
Really?

528
00:27:22,988 --> 00:27:26,456
Come! Let us adjourn to our castle!

529
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:31,261
Can you believe we
get to live with a king?

530
00:27:31,329 --> 00:27:35,299
This is going to score
us some serious Ren-tang.

531
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,011
We've just heard back from Langley.

532
00:27:47,078 --> 00:27:48,612
Using the stolen servers,

533
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,648
the bank is
basically turning itself into

534
00:27:50,715 --> 00:27:52,316
a black market stock exchange,

535
00:27:52,384 --> 00:27:55,886
laundering money for
criminals, terrorists, and rogue nations.

536
00:27:55,954 --> 00:27:57,421
So if we could access those servers,

537
00:27:57,489 --> 00:27:58,956
that intelligence would be priceless.

538
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:00,524
Exactly, Agent Walker.

539
00:28:00,592 --> 00:28:02,393
Which is why we still need Miss Volkoff.

540
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,028
As an account holder,

541
00:28:04,095 --> 00:28:05,696
she can enter the
bank, and manually upload

542
00:28:05,764 --> 00:28:07,231
a digital tag to their network.

543
00:28:07,298 --> 00:28:08,632
Bartowski--

544
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,801
do you think you can
get the asset to do that?

545
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:13,971
Uh, yes, yes, I think I can,

546
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,607
but we might have to
give her something in return.

547
00:28:16,675 --> 00:28:19,943
She would like a
meeting with her father.

548
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:21,945
A meeting?

549
00:28:22,013 --> 00:28:23,514
With Alexei Volkoff?

550
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:25,549
After all she's been through,

551
00:28:25,617 --> 00:28:27,718
don't you think we owe her that much?

552
00:28:29,154 --> 00:28:30,520
Fine.

553
00:28:30,572 --> 00:28:31,822
I'll set it up.

554
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:32,890
Thank you, General.

555
00:28:32,957 --> 00:28:35,025
Oh, and there is one more thing.

556
00:28:35,076 --> 00:28:36,293
In order to keep the bank

557
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:38,062
from realizing what
Miss Volkoff is doing,

558
00:28:38,129 --> 00:28:39,063
we'll need a diversion.

559
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,597
What did you have in mind?

560
00:28:40,665 --> 00:28:43,600
Gear up. You two
are going to rob a bank.

561
00:28:55,352 --> 00:28:57,987
So it comes down to this.

562
00:29:13,804 --> 00:29:16,005
Buy More?

563
00:29:16,056 --> 00:29:17,723
Why would there be a
facility at the Buy More?

564
00:29:17,808 --> 00:29:20,643
They've got facilities
like you wouldn't believe.

565
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:23,195
I've seen everything,
and nothing surprises me.

566
00:29:26,817 --> 00:29:30,069
The only other TR476 I'd
installed before was in Langley.

567
00:29:30,153 --> 00:29:31,520
So why here in Burbank?

568
00:29:31,588 --> 00:29:34,390
If it's above my
clearance, I don't ask questions.

569
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:35,524
Neither should you, Todd.

570
00:29:35,592 --> 00:29:36,625
Just making conversation.

571
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:37,626
Don't.

572
00:30:17,584 --> 00:30:18,868
No, it's just, uh,

573
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:21,837
maintenance, I
believe, over here in Sector 7G.

574
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:23,839
Sir.

575
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:33,599
Hi.

576
00:30:33,683 --> 00:30:35,017
Casey.

577
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:36,419
What are you doing here, Grimes?

578
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:38,471
Nothing. Nothing. I was, uh...

579
00:30:38,555 --> 00:30:41,307
I needed a place to stay, as you know.

580
00:30:41,391 --> 00:30:44,293
Uh, so I thought I could
just crash here for tonight.

581
00:30:44,361 --> 00:30:45,961
What did you see?

582
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:47,863
Are you k... I don't
have very good eyesight.

583
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:50,066
You know? I thought
they were installing some...

584
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:51,333
maybe DirecTV or something.

585
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:52,485
Or 'cause they were... You know.

586
00:30:52,569 --> 00:30:53,486
There was some... Nothing.

587
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,787
Hey, but I should go.

588
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:56,105
I'll-I'll go sleep
under my desk at the Buy More.

589
00:30:56,156 --> 00:30:57,606
You know, it's
probably more comfortable.

590
00:30:57,674 --> 00:30:58,808
If you could just kind of
point me in the right direction,

591
00:30:58,875 --> 00:30:59,975
though, 'cause again, I don't, uh...

592
00:31:00,043 --> 00:31:01,210
John! Yeah, okay, you're still there.

593
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:03,212
Okay, whoo. Okay.

594
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:10,519
We are delighted to
see you again, Miss Volkoff.

595
00:31:10,587 --> 00:31:12,721
Thank you so much.

596
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:14,140
I'm glad you were able to accommodate me

597
00:31:14,224 --> 00:31:15,141
at such a late hour.

598
00:31:15,225 --> 00:31:16,175
Our clientele

599
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:17,726
demands constant access.

600
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:18,894
Okay, she's in.

601
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,896
You ready to do this?

602
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:26,202
What are you doing? What?

603
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:28,037
We're robbing a bank, right?
You packed them, so I thought...

604
00:31:28,105 --> 00:31:30,305
Yeah, I packed them in case
we had the chance to go out later.

605
00:31:30,357 --> 00:31:31,640
Take them off. You'll wreck them.

606
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:33,742
Sorry.

607
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,844
That's better.

608
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:40,883
Now...

609
00:31:40,951 --> 00:31:43,552
Let's go rob a bank.

610
00:31:48,925 --> 00:31:51,427
Take as much time as you need.

611
00:31:54,464 --> 00:31:56,465
Just let him know
when you want to leave.

612
00:32:31,084 --> 00:32:33,335
Ma'am, wait here, please.

613
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:16,445
Drop it now!

614
00:33:16,513 --> 00:33:17,680
This is a robbery!

615
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:19,348
Everybody stay down!

616
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:35,965
Miss Volkoff, may I come in?

617
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:40,486
The CIA is not on your side, you know.

618
00:33:40,554 --> 00:33:44,807
You're simply an asset to
them; they've been using you.

619
00:33:44,874 --> 00:33:45,958
No, it's not true.

620
00:33:46,042 --> 00:33:48,911
Did one of them seem to understand you,

621
00:33:48,979 --> 00:33:51,113
you know, what you're going through?

622
00:33:51,181 --> 00:33:53,215
And did he use that connection

623
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:55,784
to get you to help him?

624
00:33:55,852 --> 00:33:59,622
And was it this one?

625
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,477
Yeah, this is Charles Carmichael.

626
00:34:05,562 --> 00:34:08,163
He's the agent responsible
for putting your father in jail.

627
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:15,104
Keep filling those bags,
people! Let's go, let's go, let's go!

628
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:16,071
Having fun?

629
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,439
A little. Kinda takes you

630
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,341
mind off the whole
wedding thing, doesn't it?

631
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:20,809
Actually, it hasn't been so bad.

632
00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:22,978
You know, I took you up on
your advice, and I found a dress.

633
00:34:23,029 --> 00:34:24,813
Hey! Ellie was right. When I put it on,

634
00:34:24,881 --> 00:34:26,315
it felt like magic.

635
00:34:26,366 --> 00:34:27,983
Get down on the ground

636
00:34:28,034 --> 00:34:29,451
before I blow your freakin' head off!

637
00:34:29,502 --> 00:34:30,836
I'm so glad you found a dress.

638
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,122
That's awesome. And I
bet you look gorgeous in it.

639
00:34:33,173 --> 00:34:35,624
Don't be a hero, my
friend! I will break your face!

640
00:34:35,692 --> 00:34:36,959
Well, it's actually really pretty.

641
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,627
And you know, I never
thought I would say this,

642
00:34:38,695 --> 00:34:41,130
but I felt like a princess.

643
00:34:42,632 --> 00:34:45,467
Mr. Riley, my father is a criminal.

644
00:34:45,535 --> 00:34:46,935
That's what they call him.

645
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:52,691
You saw what your father
left for you here at the bank.

646
00:34:52,776 --> 00:34:56,178
He loves you, you know?

647
00:34:56,246 --> 00:34:58,547
The CIA has used you.

648
00:34:58,615 --> 00:35:00,883
You know that, right?

649
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:04,053
Chuck promised me that I
would get to meet my father.

650
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,237
No...

651
00:35:05,322 --> 00:35:08,390
you're not gonna get to see your father

652
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:10,526
because they don't want you to.

653
00:35:10,593 --> 00:35:12,194
And there's only one way

654
00:35:12,262 --> 00:35:15,998
that you can truly
learn about your father.

655
00:35:16,066 --> 00:35:19,601
When you're ready...

656
00:35:19,669 --> 00:35:21,036
you let me know.

657
00:35:27,677 --> 00:35:29,244
Oh...

658
00:35:30,814 --> 00:35:34,883
You left this in your father's office.

659
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,721
Thought you might like to have it.

660
00:35:52,769 --> 00:35:53,952
Get down here!

661
00:35:55,672 --> 00:35:58,374
Come on, come on! It's
about that time, honey bunny.

662
00:35:58,425 --> 00:35:59,541
Nobody follow! We have a hostage!

663
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:00,592
Keep walking.

664
00:36:00,677 --> 00:36:03,512
No one shoot! She's a Volkoff!

665
00:36:04,931 --> 00:36:06,915
Thank you, Bank of Macau.

666
00:36:06,966 --> 00:36:09,451
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

667
00:36:29,539 --> 00:36:31,373
Mission accomplished.

668
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,881
Hey, you did great in there.

669
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:40,315
Thanks.

670
00:36:42,218 --> 00:36:44,319
Everything all right?

671
00:36:44,387 --> 00:36:45,954
Yeah.

672
00:36:46,022 --> 00:36:47,222
Everything's fine.

673
00:36:48,879 --> 00:36:50,775
Ok.

674
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:02,902
You successfully planted the
tracer in the First Bank of Macau's servers

675
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,204
and made the break-in
look like a legitimate robbery.

676
00:37:05,272 --> 00:37:07,140
The digital tag is already leading us

677
00:37:07,207 --> 00:37:08,942
to terrorist organizations

678
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:11,277
all around the globe. Good work, team.

679
00:37:11,995 --> 00:37:13,746
Uh, General, sorry.

680
00:37:13,813 --> 00:37:15,631
About the deal that we made with Vivian.

681
00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:17,232
When does she get to see Volkoff?

682
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,201
Ah, yes.

683
00:37:19,269 --> 00:37:20,769
After some consideration,

684
00:37:20,837 --> 00:37:23,372
we have decided the
security risks are too great.

685
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,341
I'm sorry. No, no! No!

686
00:37:25,408 --> 00:37:28,344
Uh, I promised her that
she'd be able to see her father.

687
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:30,279
What am I supposed to tell her now?

688
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:31,914
Agent Bartowski,

689
00:37:31,982 --> 00:37:34,383
you told your asset
what she needed to hear.

690
00:37:34,434 --> 00:37:35,901
That's what a spy does.

691
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:36,986
Well done.

692
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:42,408
Do you need my help telling her?

693
00:37:43,526 --> 00:37:45,461
No.

694
00:37:45,528 --> 00:37:47,446
Thanks, though.

695
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,031
She trusted me.

696
00:37:49,082 --> 00:37:51,033
I'll do it.

697
00:37:54,704 --> 00:37:56,639
Vivian, I'm sorry,

698
00:37:56,706 --> 00:37:59,441
but they're not going
to let you see your father.

699
00:37:59,509 --> 00:38:01,443
What?

700
00:38:01,511 --> 00:38:03,712
What do you mean?

701
00:38:03,763 --> 00:38:05,714
They went back on their word.

702
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:07,716
They? The CIA?

703
00:38:07,784 --> 00:38:09,785
But I thought you were the CIA.

704
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:11,120
I am.

705
00:38:11,187 --> 00:38:13,639
It-It's just... It's...

706
00:38:13,723 --> 00:38:15,991
It's complicated.

707
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:17,760
I'm-I'm... I'm not giving up.

708
00:38:17,827 --> 00:38:20,596
I promise, I will find
a way for you to see him.

709
00:38:20,664 --> 00:38:22,731
It just might take a
little while, that's all.

710
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:25,601
Look, I know this is
a lot to handle right now.

711
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:26,802
Are you okay?

712
00:38:27,904 --> 00:38:29,838
I'm fine.

713
00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:32,908
Thank you for being honest with me.

714
00:38:37,147 --> 00:38:40,582
 Okay, you told me that I
had to choose between the roses

715
00:38:40,633 --> 00:38:42,384
and the orchids, but that was before

716
00:38:42,452 --> 00:38:43,952
you showed me the Casablanca Lilies!

717
00:38:44,004 --> 00:38:45,170
I need a hundred dozen.

718
00:38:45,255 --> 00:38:46,388
A hundred dozen? More?

719
00:38:46,456 --> 00:38:48,724
I'm sorry. So what did
you think about the cake?

720
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:51,293
Did you like the hazelnut
cream, or...? I really liked it.

721
00:38:51,344 --> 00:38:53,395
It reminded me of this
amazing patisserie in Paris,

722
00:38:53,463 --> 00:38:55,898
and I think that maybe
we should fly the cake in.

723
00:38:55,965 --> 00:38:57,850
In fact, definitely
we should fly the cake in.

724
00:38:57,934 --> 00:38:59,184
Oh, that sounds really expensive,

725
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:00,869
especially after that
dress that you picked out.

726
00:39:00,937 --> 00:39:02,371
Well, you only get married once, right?

727
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:04,106
And this is meant to be really special,

728
00:39:04,157 --> 00:39:05,640
and plus, it'll make Chuck really happy.

729
00:39:05,692 --> 00:39:07,509
I should look into
booking a private island

730
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:09,178
for the ceremony.

731
00:39:09,245 --> 00:39:10,779
Yes.

732
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,781
Oh, my God.

733
00:39:15,035 --> 00:39:16,452
Oh.

734
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:17,703
Ellie.

735
00:39:17,787 --> 00:39:20,289
What the heck was that?

736
00:39:20,356 --> 00:39:22,791
I think I created a monster.

737
00:39:22,842 --> 00:39:24,543
Yeah. Well...

738
00:39:24,627 --> 00:39:27,396
'Cause I work... I
work... I work at the Buy More,

739
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:29,865
and that stuff sounds kind of pricey.

740
00:39:29,933 --> 00:39:33,602
Maybe you could just
pick up a few extra shifts.

741
00:39:35,188 --> 00:39:36,805
Or rob a bank.

742
00:39:36,856 --> 00:39:38,874
Ha. You...

743
00:39:41,644 --> 00:39:43,645
Oh, what's going on there, Case Logic?

744
00:39:43,696 --> 00:39:44,646
Huh?

745
00:39:44,714 --> 00:39:45,847
Case Logic?

746
00:39:45,899 --> 00:39:47,983
Mid-nineties, held your CDs?

747
00:39:48,034 --> 00:39:50,085
All right, you're
clearly not a nickname guy.

748
00:39:50,153 --> 00:39:51,320
Oh, God.

749
00:39:51,371 --> 00:39:53,322
And well, look, I
just wanted to apologize

750
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:55,240
about, uh, you
know, snooping around, man.

751
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:58,860
I just... I want you to know
I just needed a place to sleep.

752
00:39:58,912 --> 00:40:00,879
But, uh, between you and I, what was

753
00:40:00,964 --> 00:40:03,132
exactly going down there
in Castle? I mean... Nothing.

754
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:06,802
Not very nice.

755
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:08,771
Well...

756
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:11,006
Ugh. then that wasn't, uh,

757
00:40:11,074 --> 00:40:14,543
some weird, mysterious door
that I saw you walking out of?

758
00:40:16,262 --> 00:40:17,546
Look, you're right.

759
00:40:17,597 --> 00:40:19,898
I have no idea what
I'm even talking about.

760
00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:21,750
There's obviously some rational reason

761
00:40:21,818 --> 00:40:23,786
you would have a TR-476

762
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:25,270
in some weird, strange room.

763
00:40:25,355 --> 00:40:26,688
And I'm just overtired.

764
00:40:26,756 --> 00:40:28,273
I haven't slept, I haven't eaten.

765
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:30,109
And I just really want a place to stay.

766
00:40:30,193 --> 00:40:31,410
Grimes? Yeah.

767
00:40:31,494 --> 00:40:33,395
Are you leveraging me
to stay in my apartment?

768
00:40:33,446 --> 00:40:34,730
I don't, uh...

769
00:40:34,798 --> 00:40:36,898
Am I?

770
00:40:38,034 --> 00:40:40,002
Let's say I was.

771
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:42,121
Is it working?

772
00:40:42,205 --> 00:40:44,373
Okay.

773
00:40:44,424 --> 00:40:46,775
You can stay at my
place as long as you keep quiet,

774
00:40:46,843 --> 00:40:49,578
don't tell
anyone-- especially Bartowski.

775
00:40:49,646 --> 00:40:52,080
God, Casey, you have no
idea how much this means to me.

776
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:53,248
Come here. Don't...

777
00:40:53,299 --> 00:40:54,416
Don't get too excited.

778
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:55,584
Just keeping you close,

779
00:40:55,635 --> 00:40:56,969
make sure you keep your mouth shut.

780
00:40:57,053 --> 00:40:58,787
'Cause if you don't...

781
00:40:58,855 --> 00:41:01,557
I know where you live.

782
00:41:01,608 --> 00:41:03,108
Right. 'Cause I'll...

783
00:41:06,112 --> 00:41:07,946
Scram. Thank you, sir.

784
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:09,898
Thank you.

785
00:41:35,491 --> 00:41:39,428
Vivian, it's,
uh... it's Chuck and, um...

786
00:41:39,495 --> 00:41:42,664
Look, I know that you must be feeling...

787
00:41:45,451 --> 00:41:48,904
Just give me a call
when you get a chance, uh...

788
00:41:48,972 --> 00:41:50,339
if you could, that'd be great.

789
00:41:50,406 --> 00:41:51,373
Thanks. Bye.

790
00:42:06,456 --> 00:42:08,156
I'm ready to learn
the truth about my father.
