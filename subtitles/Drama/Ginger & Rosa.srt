Name of the great
spiritual leader of India

50
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:46,974
- Have you heard about him?
- Yes, I know sir

Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa

Will there be any one in our country
who does not know him?

55
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,704
Being that great man's namesake
how could you do all these nonsense?

56
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,747
I was not named by me
My dad did that

57
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,011
I told my dad many times
this name would become an irritant

58
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:10,537
Sir, do you want to hear
my dad's response to that?

59

Swami Vivekanada said
Kerala is a 'lunatic asylum'

60
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:21,305
One day you would realise
the verity of what he said

61
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:26,009
That day you would respect your name
and also your dad who named you

62
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,011
That's great
Dad and son are great

63
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,341
I have a doubt

64
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,643
How did you manage so long
to escape his dragnet?

65
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,236
Did you not hear him?

66
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,007
There is a difference between
police and the accused in one respect

67
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:41,045
What is that?

68
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,411
The accused can run anywhere
But the police can only follow him

69
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:45,707
Sir, papers are ready

70
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:47,303
Are you going to remand me?

71
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:49,244
Right now
At this place?

72
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,007
A magistrate's place
is deemed as a court

73
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:52,704
I know that sir

74
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:57,011
Without even looking at the face of
the accused you would remand for 14 days

75
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:58,273
I know that too

76
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,041
But in this case
I have something to say

77
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,138
I pray be large-hearted
to hear me, sir

78
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:16,238
Let me hear
what he has to say

79
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,110
-ls it required sir?
- Stay out

80
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:25,041
Take this

81
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,547
Before Molikutty returns from
prayer slice all the vegetables

82
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,308
This is meant for
morning's vegetable stew

83
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,470
Sir

84
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,672
I have something
to share with you

85
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:35,734
I will hear you

86
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,246
You are not going to slice
vegetables with your tongue

87
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,576
It is with a knife
Carry on

88
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:44,709
- Sir
- Vivekananda

89
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:48,305
There are sufficient grounds
to remand you for 14 days

90
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:53,009
Yet I did not do that and am
prepared to hear what you have to say

91
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,238
Have you understood that?
So first slice vegetables

92
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,746
While doing so elaborate
your life story

93
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:03,111
Sir ginger

94
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:06,444
Should it be minced in mixer
or should it be fine sliced?

95
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,740
How was your life?
Do that way

00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,674
...for my hubby to start a business
I have become a baddy

160
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:41,772
What dad earned through politics
is solely devoured by you

161
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,447
lam only asking
a share from that

162
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,774
Have water

163
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,707
Drink water

164
00:10:57,367 --> 00:11:00,075
I must get the money

165
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:01,407
If you don't give...

166
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:04,641
...don't think you both can
live here peacefully

167
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,407
- ls that so?
- I mean you also

168
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:10,108
'This is how sister
showed her love for me'

169
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:12,773
'Brother-in-law Sethu
Sathy sister's husband'

170
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:14,444
'Poor fellow'

171
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,414
'He was very
com passionate'

172
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,046
If you don't give 5 lakhs, same way
I would break everything...

173
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,706
...and set fire to this house
Come on lady

174
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:34,045
'He didn't know a better way
to express his compassion'

175
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:40,570
Brother, what have you
decided in my case?

176
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,112
'Younger sister Geetha'

177
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:45,307
'As her brother
I was her role model'

178
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:46,175
What?

179
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:50,044
- I am past 24
- That is not my fault dear

180
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,513
All my friends are married
and have 2 kids

181
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,569
It is not because of
lack of proposals

182
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:58,113
- It's because you didn't give your consent
- How will I give consent?

183
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,977
Sister was given 50 soverigns
and 1.5 acres of land

184
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:03,240
I must surely get 75 soverig ns

185
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,712
If you have no plans
to give that...

186
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:09,180
I swear on our dead dad
I would elope with some one

187
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,735
With whom?

188
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:13,640
Lots of them are after me

189
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,146
With any one of
those mean fellows

190
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:19,680
But don't think after that...

191
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:23,476
Saint Vivekananda can
call himself my brother

192
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:43,041
Viveka brother

193
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:45,069
Do you recogonise me?

194
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:51,011
Are you not
contractor Krishnan's son?

195
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:54,446
Yes, for quite some time
I was trying to see you

196
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,774
- See me
- I have seen you

197
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:57,341
But I have something
to talk to you

198
00:12:57,433 --> 00:12:59,037
Go on, go on

199
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,980
Your sister Geetha
and me are in love

200
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:06,514
It is 7 years since
we started loving

201
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,979
I am ready to marry her
without a penny as dowry

202
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:11,546
But she is not prepared

203
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:15,080
75 soverigns of gold

204
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,177
Have you seen my head?

205
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:19,644
I have lost all my hair

206
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,373
But I haven't yet
shown this to Geetha

207
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,744
Before I take charge
of the 75 soverigns...

208
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,440
...as each day passes
the remaining hair will also fall

209
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:31,572
At last when the goods are ready
and if Geetha refuses to marry me

210
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:34,045
That day I would stab you

211
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,078
Shall I take leave of you?

212
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,635
'Mother'

213
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,273
'She was the only person in this
world who did not love me'

214
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:51,338
'She expressed her
dislike for me every day'

215
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:53,242
Have one more SOH

216
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,608
Enough, belly is full

217
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,704
But you didn't eat much

218
00:13:58,033 --> 00:14:02,413
Those days you would eat
many dosa's in one go

219
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:04,769
That was long ago mom

220
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,412
Today's Vivekanadan is different

221
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:11,040
That's right! Of late,
you have changed a lot

222
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:13,704
All the time you are
running helter-skelter

223
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:15,542
SiOP

224
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,707
Stay there
Stay there man

225
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:23,146
'Running away from
the debtors of dad'

226
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:26,343
'Mom was referring
to this run'

227
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:34,412
Lord Gurvaayoorappa
Save me

228
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:38,545
Pray earnestly
He would save you

229
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,171
But he would
test you before that

230
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:43,270
If you get over the test
You are safe

231
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:45,404
Lord Narayana

232
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,646
'A test before protection'

233
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:52,112
'My friend Naijeeb Kaichery
gave me such a test'

234
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:53,237
SiOP

235
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:57,612
Was there only sufferings
and miseries in your life?

236
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,238
Amidst the turmoil created
by your dad and sisters...

237
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,371
...did you ever had
moments of happiness?

238
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:05,344
Did not God
give you that?

239
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,004
I can't get you sir

240
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:10,048
Did anyone love you?

241
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,513
Amidst these adversities
did any girl...?

242
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,637
Did no girl come
in to your life?

243
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,374
Yes sir! There was
a girl in my life

244
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,704
Roo pa

245
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,173
Then now narrate
that love story

246
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,975
Sir Naijeeb Kaichery is
cycling all the way

247
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:48,411
Let him come
Narrate this first

248
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,174
When she entered your life?

249
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:53,736
Was there a dip or appreciation
in Roopa's value? (pun-rupee)

250
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,974
Based on international
market fluctuations...

251
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:59,035
...the rupee soars high
or gets devalued sir

252
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,102
Who was that
international market?

253
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,545
- In other words the US guy?
- Her brother

254
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,103
Sub inspectorAjith Kumar

255
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,546
Shall we go?
Hold tightly

256
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:14,780
I know many people
who ogled that girl

257
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,346
But her police brother
demolished all of them

258
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:21,240
Have you understood up to this?

259
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,370
Yes, understood up to this

260
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:25,573
Even otherwise your debtors
are waiting to thrash you

261
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:27,510
Amidst this do you
want to make...

262
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:29,604
...the home department
also to your foe list?

263
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:30,702
No, I don't have
such desires

264
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:31,768
- Are you sure?
- Yes

265
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,536
Then get on to the cycle
Let's leave the place quickly

266
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:39,008
'Thus I decided to forget her'

267
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,206
'Her house'

268
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,479
'The route she passes through'

269
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:03,078
'Her music class'

270
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,176
'I tried to avoid
going to these places'

271
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:44,035
Where has she gone?

272
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,338
Foolish girl
Are you...?

273
00:17:52,433 --> 00:17:53,673
My God

274
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:06,239
Learn to read

275
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,211
So as we discussed?

276
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:11,474
Let things move on

277
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:13,171
Give money before you go

278
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:15,372
What did you say?

279
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:16,639
Money

280
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:18,144
Have you not
recogonised me?

281
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,204
How can you ask money
to a social worker?

282
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,779
Aren't you ashamed?

283
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:25,035
I would hold a poet's
meet and pay your debts

284
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,044
You...!

285
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,774
It's alright! For the time
being I forgive you

286
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,638
Pay and leave man

287
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:37,644
For the time being have this

288
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:39,644
Balance I will
pay you tomorrow

289
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:42,145
But don't repeat this any more

290
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,474
Poor fellow
He is scared

291
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:44,773
Naijeeb

292
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,139
Naijeeb I got the phone

293
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:50,377
I shelled out
6000 rupees for this

294
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:51,741
lfl had so much money...

295
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,241
...l would have paid at least
interest amount of one debtor

296
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,211
Vivekananda, this is
the period of globalization

297
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:58,247
These days the expenditure
for love would be more

298
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,644
Olden days love letters are
replaced by these mobile phones

299
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,011
There I have a doubt
We haven't talked to each other

300
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,137
We haven't even
exchanged glances

301
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:10,271
In such a situation
giving a mobile phone...

302
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,778
...as a gift to that
girl would be

303
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,503
What do you know about
the popularity of a mobile phone?

304
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:16,740
This is not
a mere mobile phone

305
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,741
This is a questionnaire

306
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,074
Question number 1

307
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:22,204
Do you love
someone else?

308
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:23,007
Does she?

309
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:24,341
If the answer
is in the affirmative...

310
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:26,071
...she would not accept
this phone and reject it

311
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:28,477
That's right! But that
does not solve the issue

312
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:31,013
Though I am older to her
she must like me

313
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,204
What should I do for that?

314
00:19:32,267 --> 00:19:34,747
- It depends on how smartly you talk
- Then let me try

315
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,740
Vivekananda

316
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,249
For all the love affairs in this world
we social workers extend our support

317
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,509
That's why though initially
I dissuaded you nowl am with you

318
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:48,209
Now after you present this gift to her
if we happen to meet we will meet again

319
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,041
What is this guy saying?

320
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:01,442
Brother is not at home

321
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,037
I did not come to meet brother
I have come to meet you

322
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,204
- To meet me?
- Yes

323
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:06,211
What's the matter?

324
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:10,306
There's an young guy in this town
who loves you more than his ATM card

325
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,179
Through this Bluetooth phone
he wants to express his love to you

326
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:15,337
Haven't you understood?

327
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:19,245
Please happily accept his gift

328
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,772
You...!

329
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:28,474
Tell me what happened afterwards

330
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:31,571
What I feared happened

331
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,973
Why did you get this model?

332
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:38,444
Can't you buy an iPhone?

333
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:41,571
Not I phone
your phone, it's your phone

334
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:43,408
iPhone, I mean iPhone

335
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:45,140
Oh you mean phone

336
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,679
We can get that
You first call him

337
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:49,407
Then tell him that
you got the gift

338
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:51,504
What was that phone?
My phone?

339
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,772
Not my phone, it's iPhone

340
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:55,479
Yes that phone would
come to you in no time

341
00:20:55,533 --> 00:20:57,774
Then I would call him right now
Tell me the number

342
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:05,144
984704263-

343
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:06,735
My God, brother

344
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,078
What is this guy doing here?

345
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:11,507
What should I say?

346
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:13,376
Greet you sir
I came to see you sir

347
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:15,276
Our club is celebrating
National language day

348
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,539
You should inaugurate
the function

349
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,671
I can clobber you
I don't know anything else

350
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:20,610
What's it girl?
Go in

351
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:26,441
Then I would invite
you for wrestling

352
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:32,707
Heymhey

353
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,211
ls the tyre deflated?

354
00:21:34,267 --> 00:21:35,678
Here...here

355
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,610
What is the last number?

356
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:42,273
- Is it one?
- No, it is four

357
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,040
- ls it four?
- Four

358
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,977
- Ok
- Bye

359
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:47,102
Did you say four?

360
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:48,976
My number ends in one

361
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:49,772
Vivekananda

362
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:54,004
People normally say
social workers are idiots

363
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,410
I am not like that

364
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,639
In case SI gets
the number from her...

365
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:01,180
...and take away the guy
Who would be affected?

366
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:01,768
Me?

367
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:04,035
No, he would be affected

368
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,411
The unfortunate guy
whose number ends with 4

369
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:11,176
In a nutshell this means
my 6000 rupees is gone

370
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:14,373
When I talk about glorious love
don't talk about petty things like money

371
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,174
How will I keep quiet
The loss is mine

372
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:19,112
We can capitalise everything
I am not available for a week

373
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,377
To study about simple living there is
a camp of social workers at Taj Hotel

374
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:27,414
When I return from the camp
I would visit the house once again

375
00:22:27,467 --> 00:22:28,343
What for?

376
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,279
Then I would tell her
last digit is one and not four

377
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,677
Then will I not become
the unfortunate guy?

378
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:36,407
Symbolically indicating
your union...

379
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:40,005
...that number would be stored
in her heart's memory card

380
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,512
Until such time you dream

381
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:46,709
Make her yours at least
in dream Vivekananda

382
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:49,441
Dream Vivekananda

383
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:20,147
'If it had been a film, this is
the right situation for a song'

384
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,338
'But there are
no songs in real life'

385
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,177
'Sol passed that
one week this way'

386
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:42,546
My god, it is locked

387
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:45,340
Brother, is there no one?

388
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,277
- They are not here
- Where have they gone?

389
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,779
They shifted to some other
place one month ago

390
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,542
She had gone sir

391
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,602
She left the town
and the house

392
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,705
That day I didn't know why she left
or where she had gone

393
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:07,303
Didn't you inquire?

394
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,143
No sir, I have suffered
many losses in life

395
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,679
That was also one of them

396
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:14,407
Pathetic

397
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:18,446
I thought you
would have got her

398
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:22,708
Not when you get
when you lose, love becomes eternal

399
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,212
Naijeeb consoled me like that

400
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:27,406
As you said
he was cycling all the way

401
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,971
What happened to the new idea
he was talking about...

402
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:32,273
...the new experiment

403
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:35,036
It is good times for you

404
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:36,237
Your brother in law Sethu...

405
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,337
...who quarreled and left
you for not giving 5 lakhs

406
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:40,709
- Wants to meet you
- What for?

407
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:42,974
I don't want to meet any one
Not for asking money from you

408
00:24:43,033 --> 00:24:44,637
- He wants to help you
- Help me?

409
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,579
Yes, he has learnt about
your plight somehow

410
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:48,543
<i>How?</i>

411
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,103
ls he not your
brother in law?

412
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,271
- Will he not feel bad about it?
- Yes, that's rig ht

413
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,677
Besides he is
financially well off now

414
00:24:55,734 --> 00:24:58,305
His business is flourishing

415
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,505
God it would be good
if he is well off

416
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:02,547
Vivekananda, you must go

417
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,275
Fortune is tapping your doors
Don't try to ignore it

418
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:09,746
Just get on bike with
your right foot forward

419
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,404
Hold it

420
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:18,513
What a set up is this?

421
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:21,070
Greet you, Sethumathavan

422
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,044
-105
- Thank you

423
00:25:25,267 --> 00:25:26,405
Come in

424
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,246
What is it?
What happened?

425
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:36,245
Nothing wrong with me

426
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,210
You are very much reduced

427
00:25:40,634 --> 00:25:42,238
What happened to you?

428
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,611
Nothing wrong with me
Brother in law

429
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,078
Nothing wrong with him too
Come and sit down

430
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:49,578
What happened
to this lady?

431
00:25:52,733 --> 00:25:56,010
- You know Mr...
- Kecheri, social worker

432
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:59,708
Vivekanandan may be
angry with me

433
00:26:00,067 --> 00:26:02,377
When I didn't get
the money I wanted...

434
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:06,142
...l had broken precious
household items

435
00:26:06,234 --> 00:26:08,305
That was not his fault

436
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:10,347
That was because of
my incomprehension

437
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:11,241
It's alright

438
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,041
What happened
because of that?

439
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,340
Vivekananda

440
00:26:14,434 --> 00:26:19,110
When I didn't get the money I wanted
I worked hard for that

441
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:22,046
Nowl own a big industry

442
00:26:22,134 --> 00:26:24,136
But no use talking about that

443
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:30,184
God has pushed me to a stage
where I can't manage it single handedly

444
00:26:30,234 --> 00:26:33,113
Last week I was
in the hospital

445
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:35,210
I had an heart attack

446
00:26:35,267 --> 00:26:39,181
Doctor says I may need
an immediate bypass surgery

447
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:44,180
You must help me out

448
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:47,775
lam handing over it
to you from today...

449
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:51,246
...the responsibilities of
running my business empire

450
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,511
Yes

451
00:26:56,167 --> 00:26:58,010
As I am being lack of children...

452
00:26:58,067 --> 00:27:01,344
You must run the business
as your own business

453
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:04,710
Tomorrow he has called for
a meeting of the clients

454
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,081
There I will officially
declare your appointment

455
00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:13,980
All the best

456
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:19,475
Thank you

457
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,306
Hello

458
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,970
My brother in law has given
me a big responsibility

459
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:36,643
I will do my level best to carry out
the responsibilities thrust on me

460
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,307
I take this opportunity to give
that assurance to you all

461
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,277
Thank you

462
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,610
I knew long ago
he is very affectionate

463
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,771
It is my son's good fortune

464
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,606
Brother if you are
managing the company...

465
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:55,546
...will they not provide you
big quarters for your stay?

466
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,670
Not quarters
It is called villa

467
00:27:57,767 --> 00:28:01,613
I have asked the astrologer to find
an auspicious date for shifting

468
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:04,273
Will you not take us
also with you?

469
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,176
Why do you talk like that?

470
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,076
When it is happy
events for me...

471
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:11,148
...how will it be happier
when you all are not with me?

472
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,544
- Good brother
- Do it fast mom

473
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:18,933
<i>tiff </i>

474
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:28,275
Driver! I can't find
anyone here

475
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,370
Who would come to
a company that is closed?

476
00:28:30,434 --> 00:28:31,777
Closed?

477
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,412
Yes, this company was
locked out 3 months ago

478
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,275
Naijeeb
No way

479
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,074
No company can be closed
without our knowledge

480
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:39,703
- How can you say that?
- We only make them close down

481
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,541
Don't kid
Call brother in law

482
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,238
'The subscriber you call...'

483
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,574
Greet you

484
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:50,113
- What happened?
- This number is not in use

485
00:28:50,733 --> 00:28:52,076
- Greet you
- Greetings

486
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:53,373
Settle my dues first

487
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:55,470
I am always the first
person to give loans to Sethu

488
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,274
I am also in that category

489
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:58,471
No ruckus please

490
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:01,707
Sethu's brother in law has come here
to settle the dues of all of us

491
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:03,110
- Can we start now?
- What is it?

492
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:04,202
Disbursement of money

493
00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:05,644
The amount that
is due from Sethu

494
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,180
Have you forgotten
your promise so soon?

495
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:10,509
Finish it off quickly

496
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:12,672
We have to leave
for some urgent work

497
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,177
One minute

498
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:18,443
Seems it is going out of our control
Call Sethu's number once again

499
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,173
This number is
not in existence

500
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:23,578
Seems he has trapped you
in this and has escaped

501
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:24,976
What will I do now?

502
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:27,479
How will I pacify them?

503
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:30,605
How did you managed to
pacify such people earlier...

504
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,271
...do the same thing

505
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:37,667

506
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,672
Don't chase me anymore
I would jump

507
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:48,508
- Don't jum p
-I would

508
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,773
Then jump man

509
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:53,007
Come

510
00:29:53,067 --> 00:29:54,444
Come fast

511
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:02,079
This is a kin to a miserable guy
getting a petrol vehicle as dowry

512
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,737
Exactly

513
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,576
Who was the guy staring
at you from the vehicle?

514
00:30:06,634 --> 00:30:09,114
- Which vehicle?
- In this vehicle

515
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:11,169
They have a photo
of yours with them

516
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,474
Yes, yes I am about
to talk about that

517
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:15,069
Please be patient sir

518
00:30:17,634 --> 00:30:22,379
'In the rest period between two
of my fleeing these people came'

519
00:30:23,233 --> 00:30:25,213
Are you not Vivekanandan?

520
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,408
So what?

521
00:30:29,733 --> 00:30:37,743
<i>Tiff </i>

522
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,404
Tell me the truth

523
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,343
- Are you guys paid killers?
- Yes

524
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,641
I will not asks you
who has sent you...

525
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:46,213
...because all those people whom
I owe money have that rights

526
00:30:46,267 --> 00:30:49,771
Before I die I would like to
talk to my grandma

527
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,705
Don't have such hopes

528
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,179
Yes she is hopeless, bedridden
That's why I want to talk to her

529
00:30:54,234 --> 00:30:57,078
- At least can I talk to my mom?
- Not possible

530
00:30:57,133 --> 00:30:58,771
Don't you have
mom and sisters?

531
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,138
Don't prattle
Sit quiet

532
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,679
Don't make us exert

534
00:31:17,233 --> 00:31:21,511
70 cheque cases
But not caught in any of them

535
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,773
Neither police nor court...

536
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,674
...or the people who lend
him money on interest

537
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:29,577
...could catch him
in their dragnet

538
00:31:31,134 --> 00:31:33,580
In that perspective
you are the right guy...

539
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:36,307
...to be emulated by those
who borrow money in Kerala

540
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:37,402
You are an expert conman

541
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,037
Vivekanandan, do you
know Pappachan sir?

542
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,171
Running a private
financial institution...

543
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:45,680
...in many pans of Kerala
A poor business man

544
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:47,769
You may know when I say
the name of the institution

545
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,274
- Elamuttam financier
- I know, I know

546
00:31:50,334 --> 00:31:53,338
Long ago I have pledged
some gold in your institution

547
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,006
But you didn't redeem it
It was auctioned

548
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:58,547
Then my circumstances
were like that

549
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,046
Circumstances are
the real troubles

550
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:06,082
Circumstances only make
a man a killer or a saint

551
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:10,172
You have come before us
because of your circumstances

552
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:14,977
Not yours, my institutions...

553
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:17,274
Those guys have come

554
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:20,037
Has boss gone?

555
00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:25,175
What brother?

556
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:28,077
- Bastard why did you do that?
- I didn't do it purposely

557
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:32,013
- You, idiot
- My god!

558
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:33,705
Was that your
dad's money?

559
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:36,247
If you don't pay the money
you would be...

560
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,574
Take him away

561
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:41,337
It is nothing

562
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:45,113
He is our Coimbatore
branch Manager

563
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:48,444
He did a small deceit
This is my response for that

564
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,535
I was asking
an explanation from him

565
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,638
Only after getting the explanation
I take disciplinary actions

566
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:56,236
Sir, you haven't told me
why you called me

567
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,544
We need a manager for
our Kadapuram branch

568
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,604
If you accept
I would be very happy

569
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,409
You might ask me on what
basis I offer you this job?

570
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:10,038
70 cheque cases
Elusive guy

571
00:33:10,133 --> 00:33:12,739
That smartness is
your credential

572
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,537
All these days I was
on the lookout for...

573
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,410
...a genuine person who
could outsmart conmen

574
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,277
In Kadapuram branch
many people get loans

575
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,576
Loans are given against
mortgage of land documents

576
00:33:25,633 --> 00:33:27,442
They would only borrow money

577
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,446
But no one would repay
even a single rupee

578
00:33:29,534 --> 00:33:31,480
And if we go for inquiry...

579
00:33:31,533 --> 00:33:33,308
Whom do you think would
come out of the house?

580
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,402
Might be male members
of the house

581
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,310
If you come here
asking for money...

582
00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:40,347
...l would slash your
and give it to the lamb

583
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,435
My god

584
00:33:43,767 --> 00:33:46,748
She is a good cultured lady

585
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,542
Males get loans
and go hiding

586
00:33:49,633 --> 00:33:52,045
I have to somehow
take them to boss

587
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,170
If I do that...

588
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:55,611
...boss has promised to
take care of my lenders

589
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,112
That's a good deal

590
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,146
But how will you take
them before boss?

591
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:01,008
Somehow we have to...

592
00:34:01,067 --> 00:34:02,637
But you have
the documents with you

593
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,044
What if we confiscate their
movable and immovable properties

594
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,011
Asking for the loan money...

595
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,580
...if anyone goes there to
confiscate their properties

596
00:34:09,634 --> 00:34:12,171
No one would return
alive from there

597
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:15,077
What is required is not might
we should use our intelligence

598
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:18,603
You're fortunate because
I have more than required

599
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,702
- What...?
- I mean intelligence

600
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,008
At last it will be
useful for you

601
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,671
You need not do such
rashness for my sake

602
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:28,214
- I know what to do
- I mean...

603
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,246
Dear Kadapuram residents

604
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:32,541
Biggest conference
against money lenders

605
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,480
Against higher interest
rates and exploitation...

606
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:40,242
...of private financial institutions
a united opposition by borrowers

607
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,473
On November 25th
at Community Hall...

608
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:45,605
...those borrowers whose property and life
are intimidated because they borrowed money

609
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,078
Bear this in mind
and participate

610
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:48,476
This is a last opportunity

611
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:53,505
Attend the conference and liberate
yourselves from the debts and liabilities

612
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,042
Hello testing
Mike testing

613
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:59,044
Dear Kadapuram residents

614
00:34:59,134 --> 00:35:02,775
We did a secret survey here
Elam uttam Pappachan

615
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,415
He and his financial institutions have
lent money to many people on interest

616
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:11,040
To recover the money lent
he is indulging in acts against...

617
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,377
...humanitarian considerations
we have information on that

618
00:35:14,434 --> 00:35:16,778
But we must shut him away
That is our aim

619
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:20,641
To achieve that all of you must participate
in the meeting to be held at Community Hall

620
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,611
This is an humble
appeal to all of you

621
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,306
So if we attend the meeting
don't we have to repay the money?

622
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:27,643
- You need not
- Then we would attend

623
00:35:27,733 --> 00:35:29,474
We would attend
and be smart

624
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:32,377
'Kadapuram borrowers
at the meeting hall...'

625
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:35,710
'...were handled by Pappachan's
goons they way they wanted'

626
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,406
'Thus the meeting
became a grand one'

627
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:41,607
'No, don't hit us
We would'

628
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,445
"Rivers, mountains, gardens
For earth..."

629
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,377
- Boss
- Who is it?

630
00:35:48,467 --> 00:35:51,243
- It's me Viveanandan
- You scared me

631
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,143
You honoured your word

632
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,339
- Now it is my turn, isn't it?
- Yes, you are right

633
00:35:55,434 --> 00:35:59,007
For 3 months none of your
lenders would trouble you

634
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:00,603
These 3 months
you would work...

635
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:04,706
...as a manager in one of the branches
of Edam uttam Financiers

636
00:36:04,767 --> 00:36:08,146
If it is Kadapuram branch they would
whip me with flap nose ray fish tail

637
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:09,269
You need not go there

638
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,677
I have found
another place for you

639
00:36:11,734 --> 00:36:16,183
After seeing your work in that branch
I would decide about other things

640
00:36:16,234 --> 00:36:17,736
- I have another request
- What's it?

641
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,276
If you can provide him
also somejob...?

642
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:23,007
- What are you credentials?
- I am a social worker

643
00:36:23,067 --> 00:36:24,011
ls that your credential?

644
00:36:24,067 --> 00:36:26,047
He does that because
he has no other options

645
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:29,179
- Then let him do recovery
- What do you say?

646
00:36:29,234 --> 00:36:30,645
Recovery manager

647
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,113
Confiscating vehicles
Head for that wing

648
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,543
Many thanks

649
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:37,375
Take it from me Vivekananda

650
00:36:37,467 --> 00:36:41,108
If boss likes, you think
your times have changed

651
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:43,340
You...thrash

652
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,107
If he doesn't like me...?

653
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:48,205
Then also think
your times have changed

654
00:36:52,233 --> 00:36:54,770
This is the manager's cabin

655
00:36:56,067 --> 00:36:58,980
This is the locker key

656
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,371
This is not a mere key

657
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:04,311
You can open heaven
and hell with this key

658
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,449
Decide what you want
by your acts

659
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,712
Have you seen this?
This is ginger

660
00:37:32,367 --> 00:37:35,177
- Ginger?
- Yes ginger

661
00:37:35,234 --> 00:37:38,545
We call gold as ginger

662
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:41,273
Ginger does not merely mean
dried ground ginger root

663
00:37:41,334 --> 00:37:43,974
It also means
pep and prowess

664
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:47,139
It's true, if we possess this
liveliness and energy are different

665
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,612
These are pledged items

666
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:53,376
This represents aspirations
and failures of many people

667
00:37:53,434 --> 00:37:57,143
You must handle it with
great responsibility

668
00:37:57,234 --> 00:38:02,115
lf something negative happens here
it would solely be due to your negligence

669
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:04,044
If something positive
happens here...

670
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:07,205
...rightful credit for that
would go to Elamuttam

671
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,644
Lord Gurvayurappa
Make everything fine

672
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:19,069
- What happened?
- It's over sir

673
00:38:19,134 --> 00:38:22,081
Who said it's over?
You are just going to start

674
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:23,544
Do you know
to slice a fish?

675
00:38:23,633 --> 00:38:25,169
- Fish
- It's very easy

676
00:38:25,267 --> 00:38:26,143
-ls it?
- Yes!

677
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,305
If you have
any doubt ask me

678
00:38:28,367 --> 00:38:32,144
Yesterday when I went to market
I got good sardines

679
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:36,105
When it comes to taste and quality
no other fish can match sardines

680
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:38,238
- Do you know that?
-Yes, I know

681
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,007
Then make a fine
start to slicing it

682
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,204
- Take this
- I mean

683
00:38:41,267 --> 00:38:44,578
I just gave a fine start to
my manager's job there

684
00:38:44,634 --> 00:38:45,977
I have not forgotten that

685
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,104
All these days
you were a vegan

686
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:51,011
From now on you are
going to become a non-vegan

687
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,142
Like a good sour and
spicy sardine curry

688
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,008
Stan slicing

689
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:57,274
While you slice
tell me the remaining story

690
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,272
You are right sir

691
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:01,640
Eating onions, sambar
and curd rice...

692
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,409
...l was leading a peaceful
life in Elamuttam finance

693
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:09,210
Suddenly took a U turn
and became non-vegan

694
00:39:09,267 --> 00:39:13,010
Like this dried sour sardine

695
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:21,439
- Excuse me
- Sit down

696
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:26,706
I am Roopa
I had pledged an item here

697
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:28,405
I have come to redeem it

698
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:33,176
That's ok
Where is the card?

699
00:39:33,234 --> 00:39:35,236
I have it with me

700
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,771
Vivekananda
Roopa (pun-rupee)

701
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,172
I don't have
Go from here

702
00:39:43,267 --> 00:39:44,746
Not that, I mean
the other Roopa

703
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,370
- Where?
- Look there

704
00:39:48,567 --> 00:39:50,672
- You mean Roopa?
- Yes, she only

705
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:51,745
Is it?

706
00:39:57,234 --> 00:39:59,544
-It is she only
-ls it?

707
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,736
- Thanks
- Okay

708
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,377
Roo pa

709
00:40:14,434 --> 00:40:16,277
Do you recogonise me?

710
00:40:17,034 --> 00:40:18,411
Just brush up your memory

711
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,242
You are the guy who turned
my life upside down

712
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,371
9847042634

713
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:26,209
That was because
I committed a small mistake then

714
00:40:26,267 --> 00:40:28,304
Because of my scare
for your police brother...

715
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,142
...l deliberately made a small
change in the last digit alone

716
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,543
Four instead of one

717
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,511
It was not a small change

718
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,673
You didn't bear in mind
the distance from 1 to 4 is big

719
00:40:38,734 --> 00:40:42,113
Now that one...is sitting inside

720
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:44,613
If you don't mind,
you can meet him

721
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,241
He is the guy

722
00:40:51,067 --> 00:40:52,978
Vivekanandan
Sit down

723
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,206
What is it?

724
00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:57,302
What?

725
00:40:57,367 --> 00:41:01,247
I was just thinking
about my folly

726
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,507
I don't know when
girls like me would realise...

727
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:07,310
...what is required is not
beauty but intelligence

728
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:08,971
No, Roopa's...

729
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:11,377
Value
No life...

730
00:41:11,434 --> 00:41:14,745
Value is a better word
That has come down

731
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,440
My police brother met
with an accident

732
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,376
Very glad!

733
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,005
- Did he die?
- No

734
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,104
Didn't you guys know
he is bedridden with paralysis?

735
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:25,544
No when was it?

736
00:41:25,634 --> 00:41:27,045
We didn't know
When was it?

737
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,047
After a while we shifted
from that place

738
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,512
What made you come here?

739
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:36,242
I had pledged few ornaments here
I came to redeem it

740
00:41:36,334 --> 00:41:37,540
- Sorry
- Yes

741
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,547
Are you here?
ls your work over?

742
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,137
Mohan meet
Mr Vivekanandan

743
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,702
I am the manager
of this branch

744
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,541
Don't you know Mohan?

745
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,707
The wrong digit
that you gave me 4

746
00:41:51,234 --> 00:41:54,977
Mohan he is the real
owner of that phone

747
00:41:55,067 --> 00:41:59,516
So instead of him
I entered your life

748
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,179
As far as I was concerned
it was a wrong call

749
00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:14,306
That too from a beautiful girl
like Roopa in her beautiful voice

750
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:16,472
When she asked me
did you send this phone?

751
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,274
I could not say 'no'

752
00:42:18,334 --> 00:42:22,373
In a way what I did to
Vivekanandan is a betrayal

753
00:42:22,434 --> 00:42:25,040
But your friend who
gave the wrong number...

754
00:42:25,133 --> 00:42:27,579
...also did the same
betrayal to you

755
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,077
If she had given
the phone and number...

756
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:38,410
...to his police brother and
asked him to break my ribs

757
00:42:38,467 --> 00:42:40,037
What would have
happened to me?

758
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,637
But she didn't do it
She would not do it because...

759
00:42:42,733 --> 00:42:46,647
...my poor Roopa
knows only to love

760
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,749
Because of your
folly I lost her

761
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,345
Giving a wrong last digit
has caused me a loss

762
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,402
Do you know what that
loss has cost me?

763
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,071
When he said
'My Roopa'...

764
00:43:04,134 --> 00:43:05,772
...l was shattered
Do you know that?

765
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,779
Each girl has a destiny
as it is written in each groin

766
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,071
No I meant grain

767
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:16,046
God has written in each girl's
forehead her hubby's name

768
00:43:16,134 --> 00:43:18,273
Roopa was destined
to be Mohan's wife

769
00:43:18,334 --> 00:43:22,373
You, me and that mobile
was just a cause

770
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:24,971
Anyway that girl was saved
That's enough

771
00:43:25,034 --> 00:43:26,604
Will you please get down?

772
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,247
Genuine friends
must be like you

773
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,109
- That's it
- I am very glad

774
00:43:32,167 --> 00:43:34,204
ls the distance to home
7 kilometers from here?

775
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,439
- Yes, might be
- You pig, walk the distance

776
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,446
- Go man
- Stop!

777
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,605
I can't get any vehicle
even for hire from here

778
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,577
That is your fortune

779
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,041
You mean me losing her?

780
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:53,142
To spoil the peace of men folk
women have emerged in earth as demons

781
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,079
Gold and women bring
conflicts in this world easily...

782
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,636
...is Kunjan Nambiar's maxim

783
00:43:57,734 --> 00:43:59,338
Do you believe he
wrote it for nothing?

784
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,438
Kunjan Nambiar merely wrote it
But it's me who experienced it

785
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,377
I experienced it
to a great extent

786
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,969
Vivekanandan

787
00:44:06,067 --> 00:44:08,013
You have a lucky charm

788
00:44:08,067 --> 00:44:12,413
After meeting you many
positive things happened to me

789
00:44:12,467 --> 00:44:15,038
We were planning
to buy an house

790
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,444
There was some
glitch over price

791
00:44:17,534 --> 00:44:19,980
Yesterday night its
owner came and told us...

792
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:22,275
...he agrees for
the price we demanded

793
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:25,246
To pay the advance amount
we need 10 lakh rupees

794
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,337
There is no use in
keep in gold at home

795
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,540
Pledge this and give
me 10 Lakh rupees

796
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,502
One minute

797
00:44:34,234 --> 00:44:35,406
Sivag ami

798
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:39,347
Bring 10 Lakh rupees
cash to cabin quickly

799
00:44:44,734 --> 00:44:46,179
Sir cash

800
00:44:48,367 --> 00:44:50,278
You need not
pledge the entire lot

801
00:44:50,367 --> 00:44:52,142
You can take back
anyone of them

802
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,737
That...l don't know
what to choose

803
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,139
You may take one
and give it to me

804
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,680
- My God, me
- No issues

805
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,313
In case Naijeeb had said
1 instead of 4 that day...

806
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,348
...you would have been
my life partner

807
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,041
Then take this

808
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,011
This would be
fine for you

809
00:45:18,434 --> 00:45:20,004
Vivekanandan

810
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,706
This is called
the congruence of mind

811
00:45:22,767 --> 00:45:25,441
I also thought of
the same chain

812
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,271
Please sign here

813
00:45:30,334 --> 00:45:32,405
- Keep it in the locker
- Okay sir

814
00:45:34,334 --> 00:45:39,374
The loss is not yours
It is mine

815
00:45:40,534 --> 00:45:42,138
Mr. Mohan...?

816
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,339
Your relationship
with Mohan...?

817
00:45:44,434 --> 00:45:45,742
Are you not happy?

818
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,747
There are no retake's
in life Vivekanandan

819
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,380
Today my life is a mobile number
with a wrong last digit

820
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,378
- Boss asked you to come
- Okay, I will

821
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,474
Greet you boss

822
00:46:19,534 --> 00:46:23,243
ls your house document
with the co-operative bank?

823
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,439
Yes! Why do you
ask about that sir?

824
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:28,208
- Any confiscation?
- Yes...!

825
00:46:28,267 --> 00:46:31,248
But not for the house
It is for you

826
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,536
Who is she?

827
00:46:40,134 --> 00:46:42,045
- She is Roopa
- I asked who is she to you?

828
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,238
She is my friend

829
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,008
So was it a joint
deceit by you both?

830
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,306
You son of a dog

831
00:46:47,367 --> 00:46:52,077
Not only to nurture you
I also know to weed out

832
00:46:52,167 --> 00:46:53,441
Look at this

833
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,276
This is all gold coated
Gold coated jewels

834
00:47:11,234 --> 00:47:17,082
Mohan Menon Tushar Villa
#13, Pavaratty

835
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,671
The green walled one

836
00:47:19,734 --> 00:47:24,183
- This is the one
- We must behave decently

837
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,104
- ls there no one here?
- Softly, go in and ask

838
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,442
Sir

839
00:47:36,334 --> 00:47:37,335
Who is it?

840
00:47:37,434 --> 00:47:40,005
We've come
to see Mr Mohan

841
00:47:40,067 --> 00:47:41,740
Who is Mohan?

842
00:47:42,033 --> 00:47:45,503
- No 13, TusharVilla
- Address is right

843
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,238
But no one called
Mohan lives here

844
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,144
We mean Roopa's
husband Mohan

845
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,510
There is no one called
Mohan or Roopa here

846
00:47:52,567 --> 00:47:55,173
This is my house
Someone has misguided you

847
00:47:55,267 --> 00:47:57,508
Sir, we would leave after
meeting Mohan once

848
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,103
Please go, please

849
00:48:00,167 --> 00:48:03,512
Like your brother in law
She has deceived you

850
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,744
For offences like this
Pappachan sir's punishment...

851
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,473
...was breaking both limbs and
sell to some mendicant company

852
00:48:15,534 --> 00:48:18,743
But in my case he
made a small waiver

853
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,037
I will give you
one month's time

854
00:48:21,134 --> 00:48:24,479
By that time bring
either cash or ginger

855
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:27,343
If you don't bring
either of them...

856
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,004
Not only you...

857
00:48:29,067 --> 00:48:32,480
...your mom and your sisters
would also suffer

858
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:36,414
Do anything to me
but leave them

859
00:48:36,467 --> 00:48:40,176
When you have good times
who are the beneficiaries?

860
00:48:40,234 --> 00:48:42,407
Your near and dear
ls it not?

861
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:48,206
So when you have bad times
should they not share that too?

862
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,506
You may 9°

863
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,637
I don't mind even
if you kill someone

864
00:48:51,734 --> 00:48:53,111
But come with cash

865
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,677
- That is...
- What happened?

866
00:49:11,734 --> 00:49:14,408
Ahmed Kuttty sir has
stopped money lending

867
00:49:14,467 --> 00:49:17,243
He says if he lends
the loss will be twofold

868
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,179
He will lose the money
and also the relationship

869
00:49:20,234 --> 00:49:22,373
I have again inquired
through many channels

870
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:25,141
There are people to lend
against mortgaged documents

871
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,474
But you would not get it

872
00:49:26,534 --> 00:49:29,674
Because your
track record is so bad

873
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,638
What will I do now?

874
00:49:32,734 --> 00:49:36,409
10 Lakhs in one month
My God, how will I make it up?

875
00:49:36,467 --> 00:49:38,674
One way is
'Tomorrow is the draw day'

876
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:42,476
You must win a lottery
or you should steal

877
00:49:43,467 --> 00:49:44,537
Stealing?

878
00:49:44,634 --> 00:49:49,049
'Discipline
Responsibility'

879
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:55,480
'Intelligence
Achieve goals'

880
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,475
Theft is not a thing that
any vagabond can do so easily

881
00:50:00,567 --> 00:50:02,069
That is an an

882
00:50:02,134 --> 00:50:04,205
So the thief is an artist

883
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,335
'Kesavan'

884
00:50:05,434 --> 00:50:07,539
'He is the ever green hero
of the art called theft'

885
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,206
'He is based in this field
for quite some years'

886
00:50:10,267 --> 00:50:12,440
'But he is never
nabbed in any case'

887
00:50:12,534 --> 00:50:16,346
'He runs classes for new thieves sneakily
in the driving school he owns'

888
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,543
'Case study classes about classical
thieves are Kesavan's current activity'

889
00:50:28,134 --> 00:50:31,047
What happened Kesava?
ls what I wanted ready?

890
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,704
Giving me a task...

891
00:50:32,767 --> 00:50:34,974
...and praying to Lord
Guruvayurappan are same

892
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:37,377
Both would happen
But there is a difference

893
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:40,005
Guruvayurappan would not steal
But Kesavan would steal

894
00:50:40,067 --> 00:50:41,102
Come

895
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:45,506
This is great

896
00:50:45,567 --> 00:50:47,444
How did you
manage to get this?

897
00:50:47,567 --> 00:50:49,444
It was parked in
a workshop for repair

898
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,003
I went there in a cops
uniform to drive it here

899
00:50:52,067 --> 00:50:55,173
When the hero is chased
by the villain cop...

900
00:50:55,234 --> 00:50:57,180
...l need a vehicle to be
pushed to the ravine

901
00:50:57,234 --> 00:50:58,178
What to do?

902
00:50:58,234 --> 00:51:01,340
I am a film
production controller

903
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,973
I have to arrange for
things the director demands

904
00:51:05,034 --> 00:51:08,015
There will be film shooting
in this area for a month

905
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,670
I may require
some more properties

906
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:11,372
I would come later

907
00:51:11,434 --> 00:51:13,414
Call the set guy

908
00:51:14,134 --> 00:51:16,239
'When Kesavan heard
about our problems...'

909
00:51:16,334 --> 00:51:18,041
'...he promised to help us'

910
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,546
'But even then
I was against theft'

911
00:51:20,634 --> 00:51:21,977
What's it?

912
00:51:22,567 --> 00:51:26,037
Even if you are to die, don't steal
was my mom's advice

913
00:51:26,134 --> 00:51:28,580
We are now stealing
to save that mom's life

914
00:51:28,634 --> 00:51:31,638
You know about Papachan sir
He means business

915
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:37,241
Theft is not a bad thing
This is a kind of inspiration

916
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:39,472
- Inspiration?
- Yes

917
00:51:39,534 --> 00:51:42,344
Have you seen the recent films?
Most of them are about stealing

918
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,641
If you ask them they would say
it was an inspiration

919
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,338
We have also inspired others

920
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,141
What you want
is Rs 10 lakhs

921
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,407
There are houses who
don't want that money...

922
00:51:50,467 --> 00:51:52,105
...that inspires us

923
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,638
That is neither
a wrong nor a sin

924
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,145
Instead it is a rig ht

925
00:51:56,234 --> 00:51:59,044
It's the right of a guy
who needs money

926
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,977
He is right

927
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:03,571
'I was dead against theft'

928
00:52:03,634 --> 00:52:06,672
But I decided to go
Move forward

929
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:15,977
There are 3 kinds of people

930
00:52:16,067 --> 00:52:18,479
Lower, upper and middle

931
00:52:18,534 --> 00:52:21,640
We have to get in to
the upper class guys house

932
00:52:22,034 --> 00:52:24,605
Similarly there are
houses of different types

933
00:52:24,667 --> 00:52:27,648
Houses with good features
without good features...

934
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:30,681
...that can be made good
that can never be made good

935
00:52:30,767 --> 00:52:32,405
In other words troublesome

936
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:36,209
We should select a house
with good features

937
00:52:36,267 --> 00:52:41,216
Feng shui is not
a deceitful concept

938
00:52:41,267 --> 00:52:46,740
As I understand it
It's also a science like theft

939
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,408
How is this house?

940
00:52:54,367 --> 00:52:57,314
- Not bad
- But it is bad

941
00:52:57,367 --> 00:53:00,746
The feng shui is wrong
The kitchen is at a wrong place

942
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,010
So there will be low peace of mind
Whose peace of mind?

943
00:53:05,067 --> 00:53:07,206
- Yours
- Wife's

944
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:11,147
When wife's peace of mind is lost
how bad this house would be...?

945
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,545
So we should
discard such houses

946
00:53:14,634 --> 00:53:19,640
Houses with good features are like
women untouched by men

947
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:23,170
Such houses would
tempt you to visit them

948
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:27,010
They would tell you
'come and steal me'

949
00:53:27,067 --> 00:53:29,741
They would yell
at us this way

950
00:53:32,534 --> 00:53:34,673
Like this

951
00:53:38,467 --> 00:53:39,571
Look there

952
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:42,478
This house is
the most ideal one

953
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,580
Well featured
in all respects

954
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:59,280
How was my comment?

955
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:02,007
Is it not ideal in all respects?
Have a look

956
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:04,411
Master bed room
is at south corner

957
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,641
Kitchen is at South west corner

958
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,206
North west for
another bed room

959
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,141
The omen is also good

960
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,044
No more inquires are required
We would fix this

961
00:54:17,134 --> 00:54:19,080
- Can we fix it?
- Fixed

962
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,477
This is the key
for the house

963
00:54:23,534 --> 00:54:25,980
But I don't know
which one is the key?

964
00:54:26,033 --> 00:54:28,035
Let's try with
any one of them

965
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,407
'Use that key
to open the gate'

966
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,114
'After opening
the gate you get in'

967
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:09,776
'Now open the door
and enter the hall'

968
00:55:14,634 --> 00:55:17,672
'The bedroom is after that'

969
00:55:18,434 --> 00:55:21,347
'The main bureau
is in bedroom'

970
00:55:21,434 --> 00:55:24,677
'That lady would have
taken one of the keys'

971
00:55:24,733 --> 00:55:29,580
'Another key is inside
the fish tank in living room...'

972
00:55:29,667 --> 00:55:31,613
'...beneath the conch'

973
00:55:31,667 --> 00:55:32,668
Come

974
00:55:34,434 --> 00:55:36,414
Here is the conch

975
00:55:44,167 --> 00:55:48,707
'Go there, enter,
take the key...'

976
00:55:48,767 --> 00:55:50,576
'Open the safe and...'

977
00:55:50,667 --> 00:55:55,275
'Take the amount not required
by them and then return'

978
00:55:55,334 --> 00:55:56,506
'What do you say?'

979
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:04,112
Any way we have stolen
Why not take it entirely?

980
00:56:04,167 --> 00:56:05,441
No Kaichery

981
00:56:05,534 --> 00:56:08,981
I prayed Lord Guruvayurappan
so that I can replace it some day

982
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:10,377
Let's take only 10

983
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:14,210
1, 2, s, 4, s, s, 7, s, 9 and 10

984
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,076
Lord Krishna, save us

985
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,580
Gently

986
00:56:30,267 --> 00:56:31,541
Hi

987
00:56:34,467 --> 00:56:36,242
My God

988
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,610
Lift, lift

989
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,179
Whom do you
want me to lift?

990
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:45,678
Lift your hands dog

991
00:56:54,267 --> 00:56:56,076
Don't move forward

992
00:56:56,134 --> 00:56:58,171
If you move,
I would kill you

993
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,671
Forgive us

994
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,513
So you need
10 Lakh rupees, right?

995
00:57:20,467 --> 00:57:22,344
No sir, we don't want

996
00:57:22,434 --> 00:57:24,710
We don't want a penny
from this house

997
00:57:24,767 --> 00:57:27,976
Yes, instead allow us to go

998
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,110
Leaving this house
will you not go to another house?

999
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:32,510
No sir, we would not go

1000
00:57:32,567 --> 00:57:34,774
We are from
respectable families

1001
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,310
I am a social worker too

1002
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:44,180
Then how will you
redeem Pappachan's debt?

1003
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:50,380
Tell me, how will you redeem?

1004
00:57:51,467 --> 00:57:52,775
I don't know sir

1005
00:57:54,033 --> 00:57:55,512
Shall I help you?

1006
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,981
Don't mock at us sir
It was out of helplessness

1007
00:57:59,467 --> 00:58:02,311
I know, that's why I asked

1008
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:05,375
Shall I give you
10 lakh rupees?

1009
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:15,345
Not as a gift
in return you do me a help

1010
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,674
What help?

1011
00:58:16,734 --> 00:58:19,078
A person has to be killed

1012
00:58:19,167 --> 00:58:20,339
Kill a person?

1013
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,243
Should I take the pistol?

1014
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,278
No sir!

1015
00:58:25,467 --> 00:58:28,778
God has sent
you guys before me

1016
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:36,108
This house is full of
hidden camera's

1017
00:58:48,634 --> 00:58:51,137
From the moment
you entered the house...

1018
00:58:51,233 --> 00:58:53,406
...everything is recorded
in those camera's

1019
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,407
If I handover that
to the police...

1020
00:59:00,467 --> 00:59:03,971
...l hope you can guess
what would happen

1021
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:11,571
I don't want you guys to be behind bars
for a wrong not committed by you

1022
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,670
But you should also
reciprocate that gesture

1023
00:59:19,134 --> 00:59:21,512
Whom are you
asking us to kill?

1024
00:59:21,567 --> 00:59:23,274
Venkiti

1025
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,106
My friend called
Venkitakrishnan

1026
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,676
He is my foe now

1027
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:35,173
'Venkitakrishnan is
a jack of all trades'

1028
00:59:35,234 --> 00:59:40,013
'He is an expert in over 10 languages
including foreign languages'

1029
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:44,742
'But he showed his
skills in another domain'

1030
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,604
'In a domain called women'

1031
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:50,410
'He was the greatest
womaniser I have ever seen'

1032
00:59:50,467 --> 00:59:54,176
'He could take any woman
known to him to his bed'

1033
00:59:54,234 --> 00:59:59,547
'No one could match
his skill of alluring women'

1034
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:04,044
- Do you know one thing?
- What is it?

1035
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,307
Our new MD
Susamma verghese-

1036
01:00:06,367 --> 01:00:08,040
- Are you fine?
- Yes

1037
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:08,976
Come

1038
01:00:09,034 --> 01:00:12,709
Yesterday night she slept
at my house in my bed

1039
01:00:14,167 --> 01:00:16,113
Similarly countless women
were at his bed

1040
01:00:16,167 --> 01:00:19,148
I don't know if it is
out of rage or jealousy...

1041
01:00:19,567 --> 01:00:21,547
I challenged him over

1042
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,013
People whom I
thought were virtuous

1043
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,472
What's it man?

1044
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,010
New copywriter Tanuja warrier

1045
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,773
Can you bewitch her?

1046
01:00:38,367 --> 01:00:40,278
Come to my house tonight

1047
01:00:40,334 --> 01:00:43,975
You can see me with Warrier

1048
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,544
Hi

1049
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,537
- What is this?
- Come

1050
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,238
Ginseng, asparagus,
sarsaparilla

1051
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:12,008
Ashwagantha and Chamomile petals

1052
01:01:12,067 --> 01:01:14,240
Mix all these in boiled oil

1053
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:17,543
Roots of milk tree,
nuts of thorn tree, Maca root

1054
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,410
...crush all these and mix
it in dried cow's milk

1055
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:23,276
<i>Mus“ roots, garden crass
and anethcﬂe...</i>

1056
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:27,110
...mix all these in equal quantities
and add Fritillaria roylei

1057
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:31,411
Grind it add sugar
cow's milk, ghee...

1058
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,242
...fry and make it
as a flat cake

1059
01:01:36,133 --> 01:01:38,613
I consume this daily

1060
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:41,204
Then will I not be like this?

1061
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:47,271
I have memorised his recipe

1062
01:01:47,334 --> 01:01:49,507
Ginseng, asparagus, sarsaparilla

1063
01:01:49,567 --> 01:01:51,376
Ashwagantha and Chamomile petals

1064
01:01:51,467 --> 01:01:52,639
Mix all these in boiled oil

1065
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:55,374
Roots of milk tree,
nuts of thorn tree, Maca root

1066
01:01:55,434 --> 01:01:57,744
Crush all these and mix
it in dried cow's milk

1067
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,507
<i>Mus“ roots, garden crass
and anethcﬂe...</i>

1068
01:01:59,567 --> 01:02:02,104
...mix all these fry
and make it a flat cake

1069
01:02:02,167 --> 01:02:05,705
Let me try ifl can
overcome Molikutty?

1070
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:07,178
You do your work

1071
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,511
You would have noticed
a girl going out from this house

1072
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:17,042
Devaki, my wife

1073
01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:19,307
I don't have kins or kith

1074
01:02:19,367 --> 01:02:21,404
She was a gift to me
by the period of time

1075
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,677
We loved for 6 months
and then got married

1076
01:02:27,667 --> 01:02:30,648
I was thrilled and believed
entire world was beneath me

1077
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:34,739
But that happiness
did not last long

1078
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:38,407
'I was tested
through an accident'

1079
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:41,504
'The tragedy happened
during my honeymoon'

1080
01:03:08,734 --> 01:03:12,045
Now Devika is working
as a subordinate to him

1081
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:16,414
lam sure he would
have marked Devika

1082
01:03:19,734 --> 01:03:22,374
That is my apprehension

1083
01:03:22,434 --> 01:03:25,005
Before that happens
he should die

1084
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,477
Not for my sake alone

1085
01:03:26,534 --> 01:03:28,480
For the sake of all those men...

1086
01:03:28,534 --> 01:03:31,606
...who have wives and sisters
For the sake of all women

1087
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:35,547
You must also understand
what you're going to do is not a sin

1088
01:03:35,634 --> 01:03:41,107
Venkitakrishnan must die
He does not deserve to live

1089
01:03:55,233 --> 01:03:57,076
Nothing to ponder over this

1090
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:59,374
Don't accept that offer

1091
01:03:59,467 --> 01:04:02,107
Vivekanandan, murder
is not like theft

1092
01:04:02,167 --> 01:04:03,202
It is a sin

1093
01:04:03,267 --> 01:04:06,077
Humans don't have rights
to kill life given by God

1094
01:04:06,167 --> 01:04:07,339
Absolutely right

1095
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,006
Not only that
The section would be 302

1096
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,011
Can get up to
death sentence

1097
01:04:12,067 --> 01:04:14,138
I knew all these

1098
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:18,080
But my mind did not
go through the good path

1099
01:04:18,167 --> 01:04:20,773
It was a night where
I had lost everything

1100
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,275
What have you decided?

1101
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,572
We agree

1102
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:39,111
But we wouldn't
kill Venkitakrishnan

1103
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,076
Then?

1104
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:43,273
We would kill her
Your wife Devika

1105
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,109
Let it be any man
anywhere in the world...

1106
01:05:15,167 --> 01:05:17,078
...however great
a seducer he is

1107
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:20,740
...he can't even touch
a woman without her consent

1108
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,537
When Venkitakrishnan
attempts to seduce them...

1109
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:26,774
...if the women are ready to fall
a prey are they not to be blamed?

1110
01:05:27,467 --> 01:05:33,509
Anyway unfortunately your wife is
at the edge of such a situation

1111
01:05:35,567 --> 01:05:37,774
To start with
it would be interesting

1112
01:05:39,434 --> 01:05:41,436
Later it becomes habitual

1113
01:05:43,634 --> 01:05:47,343
As days pass by it would become
an unavoidable necessity

1114
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:53,071
In between, you would become
an impediment to your wife's merry making

1115
01:05:53,167 --> 01:05:55,044
Afterwards like
any other woman...

1116
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:58,240
...she would think about
getting away from you

1117
01:05:58,767 --> 01:06:01,475
Even now you
are sitting like this

1118
01:06:01,567 --> 01:06:05,071
She would not find it
difficult to do away with you

1119
01:06:05,167 --> 01:06:09,047
You don't know
you are sleeping with a foe

1120
01:06:09,134 --> 01:06:11,580
You must understand
that at least now

1121
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:23,047
One who welcomes
will only become popular

1122
01:06:23,134 --> 01:06:27,066
So she is the wrong doer
from start to end

1123
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:28,546
And she alone

1124
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,337
Then what did he decide?

1125
01:06:50,467 --> 01:06:54,279
On one side he had great love for his
wife who was like this boiling milk

1126
01:06:54,334 --> 01:06:58,077
On the other side like this tea
dust...there was Venkitakrisnan

1127
01:06:58,134 --> 01:07:01,308
If one tea spoon of
Venkitakrishnan falls in the milk...

1128
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:07,316
...the resultant one would not be his
wife whom he thought was his own

1129
01:07:07,367 --> 01:07:11,372
Instead she would be
an altogether changed Devika

1130
01:07:11,434 --> 01:07:15,075
When he realised this
he gave his consent

1131
01:07:15,167 --> 01:07:16,703
But on one condition

1132
01:07:16,767 --> 01:07:20,214
That she should never
know he was the killer

1133
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,337
- Can little sugar be added?
- What do you say?

1134
01:07:22,434 --> 01:07:24,505
I asked ifl can
add sugar for you?

1135
01:07:24,567 --> 01:07:26,740
Little sugar will do

1136
01:07:28,333 --> 01:07:31,177
So a short tea break

1137

Why do you think so much?
You could just place it here

1139
01:08:09,234 --> 01:08:11,180
Aren't you ashamed man?

1140
01:08:11,234 --> 01:08:14,579
How could you play like a child
with an accused brought by police?

1141
01:08:14,633 --> 01:08:17,136
Have you finished your prayers?

1142
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:21,148
Molikutty he has stopped the story
at a critical juncture

1143
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,770
Agirl is about to die

1144
01:08:23,034 --> 01:08:27,414
Thought about a small relaxation
before I come to know about it

1145
01:08:27,467 --> 01:08:30,038
Molikutty come this side

1146
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:34,314
Though I hear his story
I consider his story as a statement

1147
01:08:34,367 --> 01:08:36,733
Only after knowing
what happened to the girl...

1148
01:08:36,734 --> 01:08:39,340
...l have to decide if he is to
be remanded or punished

1149
01:08:39,434 --> 01:08:42,244
Until then please
don't disturb me

1150
01:08:44,067 --> 01:08:45,444
Continue man

1151
01:08:46,234 --> 01:08:49,147
You need not stop talking
becausel am here

1152
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,679
I would go

1153
01:08:53,134 --> 01:08:54,977
- She is my husband
- What?

1154
01:08:55,034 --> 01:08:56,479
I mean wife

1155
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,711
What happened later, tell me?

1156
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:01,976
Wanted to build a close
relationship with Devika...

1157
01:09:02,067 --> 01:09:04,047
...whom I was supposed to kill

1158
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:08,276
So that I can
kill her anytime later

1159
01:09:08,634 --> 01:09:10,477

that you idea?

about one thing?

1213
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,310
Kerala is ranked first in
alcohol consumption in India

1214
01:11:38,367 --> 01:11:40,540
I did not say you should
not venture in to business

1215
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,672
I just said that doesn't
require a consultancy's services

1216
01:11:43,734 --> 01:11:45,645
Why is it not required?
That's my question

1217
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:48,578
Among normal liquor consumers of
Kerala which is consumed more...

1218
01:11:48,634 --> 01:11:50,375
...Branddy, Whisky, Rum or-

1219

- Devika
- One second sir

1223
01:11:59,134 --> 01:12:01,512
This business of
yours is anti social

1224
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:04,237
It is opposed to the society

1225
01:12:04,334 --> 01:12:07,645

01:12:10,067 --> 01:12:10,636
Hello

01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,373
Excuse me ma'am

It is a hectic day
I can't Krishnan

1231

Don't cry!

01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,543
Move away

1233
01:12:24,201 --> 01:12:26,203
I have a severe headache

1234
01:12:30,534 --> 01:12:32,275
I can't tolerate this

1235
01:12:32,334 --> 01:12:35,008
Don't weep
I am with you

1236
01:12:35,067 --> 01:12:36,705
Cool! Compose yourself

1237
01:12:36,801 --> 01:12:41,341
To tell you the truth, I can't
tolerate such anti social elements

1238
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,209
He has come with
a business proposal

1239
01:12:43,267 --> 01:12:44,211
Come on

1240
01:12:44,267 --> 01:12:46,144
Damn with his

1241
01:12:49,167 --> 01:12:52,512
In fact we went there
to become close with her...

1242
01:12:52,567 --> 01:12:53,739
But see what happened

1243
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,445
We had to fight with
her and break apart

1244
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,104
It's all because of Kesavan

1245
01:12:57,167 --> 01:12:59,647
Did I know it would
happen like that?

1246
01:12:59,734 --> 01:13:02,681
I feel it is all for good

1247
01:13:02,734 --> 01:13:07,479
Using this dispute we can
establish a relationship with her

1248
01:13:07,534 --> 01:13:08,444
Relationship?

1249
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,446
- He does not mean that relationship
- I have a doubt

1250
01:13:10,501 --> 01:13:13,107
- Where did she go with that pencil?
- Not pencil Venkiti

1251
01:13:13,167 --> 01:13:14,771
Both are same
Where did she go?

1252
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,002
To his house, where else?

1253
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:25,105
Without clear evidences never raise
such a charge against a woman

1254
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:26,373
That is not honourable

1255
01:13:26,467 --> 01:13:30,438
Will you be satisfied with
the evidence of Venkiti's servant?

1256
01:13:30,501 --> 01:13:33,107
Sir and madam came here

1257
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:36,113
They were here
for 3 to 4 hours

1258
01:13:36,634 --> 01:13:40,707
Then I went straight
to Harinarayanan

1259
01:13:40,767 --> 01:13:43,304
Your wife was
at Venkiti's house...

1260
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:46,711
...where he is staying
alone for 3 to 4 hours

1261
01:13:46,767 --> 01:13:51,182
You can imagine what would
have happened there

1262
01:13:52,767 --> 01:13:56,010
No, you need not
wait anymore

1263
01:13:56,101 --> 01:13:58,638
She must die
as early as possible

1264
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,536
Madam this is the plan

1265
01:14:02,634 --> 01:14:05,615
It must include the company's
requirements as given in their bio

1266
01:14:05,667 --> 01:14:07,408
Like id proof
and other similar things

1267
01:14:07,467 --> 01:14:08,969
Good morning ma'am

1268
01:14:09,034 --> 01:14:11,605
- Who permitted them to enter?
- They wanted to meet you madam

1269
01:14:11,667 --> 01:14:15,171
- I don't want to meet any one
- Excuse me, I have to tell you something

1270
01:14:15,267 --> 01:14:16,712
Madam said she does
not want to meet you

1271
01:14:16,767 --> 01:14:17,768
lam also a client

1272
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,570
Sorry sir, madam is
not interested

1273
01:14:19,634 --> 01:14:22,205
Madam's interest is
not my problem

1274
01:14:22,267 --> 01:14:24,247
As a client I have
my own rights

1275
01:14:24,301 --> 01:14:25,211
- Excuse me
- Yes

1276
01:14:25,267 --> 01:14:26,678
I will explain,
please come

1277
01:14:26,734 --> 01:14:29,510
Sorry sir, I haven't come to meet you
I want to meet Devika madam

1278
01:14:29,567 --> 01:14:32,343
Hello you can meet her
But I have something to talk to you

1279
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:33,607
Okay come

1280
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:40,574
Liquor is the villain
that shattered Devika's life

1281
01:14:40,667 --> 01:14:43,170
Devika's husband is
now on wheel chair

1282
01:14:43,267 --> 01:14:46,476
A punishment given
by God for drunken drive

1283
01:14:47,534 --> 01:14:49,138
That may be the reason

1284
01:14:49,234 --> 01:14:53,046
Devika behaved like that to
your liquor business plans

1285
01:14:53,101 --> 01:14:55,274
Anyway sorry
Sorry for the trouble

1286
01:14:55,367 --> 01:14:58,405
I will inform Devika
She will abide with me

1287
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,002
- I know that
- What do you know?

1288
01:15:00,101 --> 01:15:02,138
- I have understood
- What have you understood?

1289
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,975
Yesterday when I saw you both...

1290
01:15:04,034 --> 01:15:06,139
...l could understand the chemistry
between you both

1291
01:15:06,234 --> 01:15:07,679
If I not mistaken
Shall I say something?

1292
01:15:07,767 --> 01:15:10,145
You both make a good pair
Made for each other

1293
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,077
- Thank you
- Welcome

1294
01:15:14,001 --> 01:15:15,674
Damn with his thanks

1295
01:15:15,734 --> 01:15:17,213
Naijeeb, shall I
ask you one thing?

1296
01:15:17,267 --> 01:15:19,645
What do women
see in this beggar?

1297
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:22,681
Why women fall an easy prey
to Venkiti's seductions?

1298
01:15:22,734 --> 01:15:24,475
Is he handsome?
Does he have money?

1299
01:15:24,534 --> 01:15:26,138
Damn with his
french beard

1300
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:31,013
To seduce women neither money
nor beauty or intelligence is required

1301
01:15:31,067 --> 01:15:33,013
The only requirement is
you must be spineless

1302
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:34,170
I don't understand

1303
01:15:34,234 --> 01:15:37,272
Whatever absurdity they say
just say it is great

1304
01:15:37,334 --> 01:15:40,247
All the time praise them

1305
01:15:40,334 --> 01:15:43,315
Venkiti must be
an expert in these two

1306
01:15:43,367 --> 01:15:44,368
You're right

1307
01:15:44,434 --> 01:15:47,005
This is not right
This plan is not correct

1308
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,602
See Sherin

1309
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:52,978
In Kochi metro's proposed plan
it extends only up to Aluva

1310
01:15:53,034 --> 01:15:55,605
In future it may extend up
to Nedumbaserry airpon

1311
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:58,010
Then how will this
construction work out

1312
01:15:58,067 --> 01:15:59,045
Sorry madam

1313
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:01,080
Sorry can't be an excuse

1314
01:16:01,167 --> 01:16:02,669
May I come in ma'am?

1315
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:03,711
Yes

1316
01:16:06,067 --> 01:16:09,605
- I have already told you that
- I have discarded that project madam

1317
01:16:09,667 --> 01:16:11,578
Hereafter I would
never sell liquor

1318
01:16:11,634 --> 01:16:14,080
Liquor is a Satan
that fells many families

1319
01:16:14,134 --> 01:16:16,705
Sir does not require money
earned by selling liquor

1320
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,973
Baby food for kids
I'm sorry

1321
01:16:19,034 --> 01:16:21,742
Instead of liquor we are
planning to start that

1322
01:16:21,801 --> 01:16:24,714
I have to thank you
for this change of mind

1323
01:16:24,767 --> 01:16:29,546
You have taught me money is not
something to be earned by selling liquor

1324
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,341
In appreciation of that

1325
01:16:31,401 --> 01:16:36,248
I have decided to name my
new business as Devika Baby Foods

1326
01:16:44,667 --> 01:16:48,638
With that Devika's hatred
for me mitigated a bit

1327
01:16:48,734 --> 01:16:52,648
When I invited her to visit my non
existent business's nonexistent office

1328
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:55,442
She gladly agreed to visit

1329
01:16:56,267 --> 01:17:01,267
<i>tiff </i>

It is on top

1331
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:20,443
Come madam, please

1332
01:17:20,501 --> 01:17:21,741
Please come

1333
01:17:24,667 --> 01:17:28,410
This is supposed to be
the 7th floor of this building

1334
01:17:28,834 --> 01:17:33,476
In this 7th floor I am planning
to have my office's main block

1335
01:17:33,534 --> 01:17:35,741
No, you should never do it

1336
01:17:36,534 --> 01:17:40,744
Having a consumer product's office at
such a height would in no way help you

1337
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,748
You are viewing it from
a consultant's point of view

1338
01:17:44,801 --> 01:17:48,647
But as far as I am concerned this
place is very close to my heart

1339
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:50,702
I mean sentimental attachment

1340
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:52,508
Madam do you know
about a thing?

1341
01:17:53,734 --> 01:17:55,236
My God!

1342
01:17:55,334 --> 01:17:58,440
'There can't be
a better place to kill her'

1343
01:17:58,534 --> 01:18:01,310
Madam do you know about it?

1344
01:18:01,367 --> 01:18:04,974
If you look from here, you can
see Guruvayurtemple's flag mast

1345
01:18:07,167 --> 01:18:09,408
You mean that one?
ls that the flag mast?

1346
01:18:09,467 --> 01:18:13,210
That's not the flag mast
That is a mobile phone tower

1347
01:18:13,267 --> 01:18:15,247
Madam you come this side

1348
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,972
Come here

1349
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:17,977
Look from here

1350
01:18:18,067 --> 01:18:19,705
- From here?
- Yes have a look

1351
01:18:19,767 --> 01:18:21,178
You would never
see from here

1352
01:18:21,267 --> 01:18:24,612
lam even planning to name
this building as 'Dwaja Darshan'

1353
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:27,147
- I don't believe
- Come...come

1354
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,577
Move towards left a little

1355
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:31,011
- Look from there
- I don't see

1356
01:18:31,234 --> 01:18:35,182
Pray the god Krishna Guruvayurappa
and look, you will see

1357
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:40,544
You...!

1358
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:42,673
What is this?

1359
01:18:42,734 --> 01:18:45,544
Who is it?
These people only yelled

1360
01:18:49,634 --> 01:18:52,615
- What's it man?
- Boss is on line

1361
01:18:53,167 --> 01:18:55,738
- 'Son of a dog'
- What sir?

1362
01:18:55,800 --> 01:19:00,044
Along with your lady love
are you planning to commit suicide?

1363
01:19:00,101 --> 01:19:00,738
Yes!

1364
01:19:00,801 --> 01:19:03,372
No, who said so?

1365
01:19:03,434 --> 01:19:06,244
As long as I am alive I would
not allow that to happen

1366
01:19:06,301 --> 01:19:07,746
I know...l know

1367
01:19:08,001 --> 01:19:10,208
Either money or ginger...

1368
01:19:10,267 --> 01:19:13,476
...or yours, your mom's
and sister's

1369
01:19:13,567 --> 01:19:17,071
...6 kidneys and other organs
that can be sold for money

1370
01:19:17,134 --> 01:19:21,082
I would not settle
for anything less

1371
01:19:22,134 --> 01:19:24,978
Okay boss, see you then

1372
01:19:25,034 --> 01:19:25,999
Bye

1373
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,741
It was a call from boss

1374
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,207
Calls me at the wrong time

1375
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,644
Because this was goofed up
why do you get dejected?

1376
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,043
There are many more ways

1377
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,340
What ways?
May be highways

1378
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,435
Yes it is highway

1379
01:19:36,534 --> 01:19:38,980
Away to kill her in highways

1380
01:19:39,034 --> 01:19:39,705
I don't understand

1381
01:19:39,767 --> 01:19:42,111
- You knowl am a stealer
- Yes I know

1382
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,339
- Do you also knowl am a mechanic?
- Yes, I know that too

1383
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:48,212
When a thief and mechanic come together
do you know what will happen?

1384
01:19:48,301 --> 01:19:50,110
Come I will show you

1385
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,009
What is this guy
going to show us?

1386
01:19:53,734 --> 01:19:55,042
Come on man

1387
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:57,546
Your pain Devika
would end today

1388
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,738
I would show you the way

1389
01:19:59,001 --> 01:19:59,638
Come on

What did you do
in her vehicle?

Did you do this?

1400

No, coming out of office
she gets in to the vehicle

1401

Yes gets in

Yes leaves

1404

Enroute she applies brake
What would happen?

1405
01:21:01,334 --> 01:21:03,075
The breaks would fail

1406
01:21:03,167 --> 01:21:05,443
This is where I differ
from you guys

1407
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,502
For first brake pedal press
brake would function

1408
01:21:07,567 --> 01:21:08,637
Until when?

1409
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:10,646
Until vehicle is switched off

1410
01:21:10,734 --> 01:21:13,214
Once vehicle is switched off
and then switched on

1411
01:21:13,267 --> 01:21:16,737
Neither she nor her dad
can make the brake function

1412
01:21:17,467 --> 01:21:20,175
But if she doesn't
switch off the vehicle

1413
01:21:20,267 --> 01:21:22,110
That's it

1414
01:21:22,201 --> 01:21:26,343
If she doesn't switch off until
she reaches home this may not work out

1415
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,040
Anyway we will do one thing
She comes this way

1416
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:32,445
We will wait somewhere here, stop her
car and make her switch off the vehicle

1417
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:33,774
...and make her
start the car again

1418
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,741
When she applies brake
then will it not be ok?

1419
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,007
- It would be ok
- Then we will stop here

1420
01:21:38,767 --> 01:21:43,767

1421
01:21:53,267 --> 01:21:54,439
Poor girl

1422
01:21:54,534 --> 01:21:56,480
Why d0 you say so?

1423
01:21:56,534 --> 01:21:58,514
Her car was moving fast

1424
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,171
A banging noise
And then ambulance returns

1425
01:22:01,234 --> 01:22:02,713
ls it not sufficient to guess?

1426
01:22:02,767 --> 01:22:05,077
That is sufficient
But please come here sir

1427
01:22:05,134 --> 01:22:07,307
Look inside the ambulance

1428
01:22:08,767 --> 01:22:11,304
My god

1429
01:22:13,434 --> 01:22:15,072
-ls it notyou?
- Yes

1430
01:22:15,134 --> 01:22:16,613
How did this happen?

1431
01:22:18,301 --> 01:22:21,111
Kesava, where all should I
look for you?

1432
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,611
Why are you all here

1433
01:22:22,667 --> 01:22:24,146
We were

1434
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,577
No we are searching for a guy

1435
01:22:25,634 --> 01:22:27,671
You can do that later
Now get in to the vehicle

1436
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:28,576
What for?

1437
01:22:28,634 --> 01:22:30,443
I brought a vehicle
for the first time

1438
01:22:30,534 --> 01:22:32,275
I have come to give
a treat to Kesavan

1439
01:22:32,334 --> 01:22:33,779
Now all of you
can get in to the car

1440
01:22:34,034 --> 01:22:35,638
No if we go now

1441
01:22:36,001 --> 01:22:37,105
come guys

1442
01:22:37,167 --> 01:22:39,113
It was my fortune
I saw you guys here

1443
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:40,202
Lazy fellows

1444
01:22:40,267 --> 01:22:42,679
KL 46 F 5944

1445
01:22:49,034 --> 01:22:51,071
ls that vehicle 44 or 45?

1446
01:22:51,167 --> 01:22:52,703
This is 44, why is it not good?

1447
01:22:52,767 --> 01:22:54,303
This is good
But was that vehicle

1448
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,402
- When did you get this vehicle?
- About a month back

1449
01:22:56,467 --> 01:22:58,572
Was it one month back?
Then no issues get in

1450
01:22:58,634 --> 01:23:00,443
Come, I have to get back
to shooting location

1451
01:23:00,534 --> 01:23:02,536
After two pegs, will you not
drop us back here?

1452
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,635
Only two pegs

1453
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:04,576
Come

1454
01:23:07,034 --> 01:23:10,277
For one month
I was negotiating the price

1455
01:23:10,367 --> 01:23:12,643
Just one hour before
we came to an agreement

1456
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:15,648
- What are you talking about?
- About this vehicle only

1457
01:23:15,734 --> 01:23:17,680
Immediately I drove
the vehicle out

1458
01:23:17,767 --> 01:23:19,713
Did you buy this
vehicle one hour before?

1459
01:23:19,767 --> 01:23:21,041
- Yes!
- From whom?

1460
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:23,046
From Metro consultancy madam

1461
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,602
- Which madam?
- Devika madam

1462
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:29,116
Before you met us, did you switch off
the vehicle and switch on it again?

1463
01:23:29,167 --> 01:23:31,545
Yes, I switched it off
before I asked you all to get in

1464
01:23:31,634 --> 01:23:33,375
Now what speed
are you driving?

1465
01:23:33,434 --> 01:23:35,243
- Maximum
- ls it so?

1466
01:23:35,301 --> 01:23:38,180
Then place this wreath
on your chest

1467
01:23:38,267 --> 01:23:39,075
Why?

1468
01:23:39,134 --> 01:23:40,442
You may require it

1469
01:23:50,367 --> 01:23:54,645
With that for the time being
I stopped my efforts to kill her

1470
01:23:54,734 --> 01:23:58,978
Instead of eliminating her physically
I attempted to shatter her mentally

1471
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:01,742
That was my plan

1472
01:24:06,334 --> 01:24:07,608
Then

1473
01:24:10,767 --> 01:24:14,476
'3 months later'

1474
01:24:15,034 --> 01:24:17,105
Baskets please

1475
01:24:17,667 --> 01:24:20,113
Well, Babu

1476
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,975
Catch it

1477
01:24:27,134 --> 01:24:29,080
Move

1478
01:24:32,267 --> 01:24:33,712
Devika

1479
01:24:34,334 --> 01:24:35,711
- Was it you?
- Yes

1480
01:24:35,767 --> 01:24:38,008
Where were you for
quite some days?

1481
01:24:38,067 --> 01:24:40,172
We were in outstation

1482
01:24:40,234 --> 01:24:42,145
Today Venkiti has
arranged for a party

1483
01:24:42,234 --> 01:24:43,611
I have come for purchasing

1484
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:45,702
I also want to buy a gift
What about you?

1485
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:48,644
I came to meet you specifically

1486
01:24:48,734 --> 01:24:51,681
We came to know about
your stories only yesterday

1487
01:24:51,734 --> 01:24:54,305
Seems your husband
is in wheel chair

1488
01:24:56,167 --> 01:24:57,373
So sad

1489
01:24:57,734 --> 01:25:01,307
I pray daily
Not for anything else

1490
01:25:01,534 --> 01:25:04,572
That chapter should
close at the earliest

1491
01:25:04,667 --> 01:25:07,671
No, to close that chapter

1492
01:25:07,734 --> 01:25:09,077
Killing you

1493
01:25:09,134 --> 01:25:10,238
- Where?
- She has gone

1494
01:25:10,334 --> 01:25:12,336
- Is it?
- Quick

1495
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:18,045
If the useless wheel chair
bound husband's life is over...

1496
01:25:18,134 --> 01:25:19,408
...will you not become free?

1497
01:25:19,467 --> 01:25:23,609
Thereafter you can lead a happy life
with person of your choice

1498
01:25:23,667 --> 01:25:27,012
Venkiti is waiting
for quite some time

1499
01:25:33,301 --> 01:25:36,612
After today's party
she should not go out alive

1500
01:25:36,667 --> 01:25:39,443
She should die
during the party

1501
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,707
How, tell that also

1502
01:25:41,767 --> 01:25:43,440
She should be
stabbed to death

1503
01:25:43,501 --> 01:25:45,037
Who
You?

1504
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:47,580
Then all of us
can be behind bars

1505
01:25:47,667 --> 01:25:50,978
If we were to kill her directly
that could have been done long ago

1506
01:25:51,067 --> 01:25:55,413
She should not only die
no one should know that we did that

1507
01:25:55,467 --> 01:25:57,174
I have found a way out for that

1508
01:25:57,234 --> 01:25:58,144
<i>How?</i>

1509
01:25:58,234 --> 01:26:00,145
Do you know what is this?

1510
01:26:00,201 --> 01:26:01,407
Fish

1511
01:26:04,634 --> 01:26:05,612
Dagger

1512
01:26:05,667 --> 01:26:07,613
Not a mere dagger
It is an ice dagger

1513
01:26:07,667 --> 01:26:10,079
If you stab with this,
the person will surely die

1514
01:26:10,134 --> 01:26:13,115
No cop can find out
who killed him

1515
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:17,115
The stabbers finger print
would also melt away

1516
01:26:17,167 --> 01:26:20,376
- How is my intelligence?
- This is not your intelligence

1517
01:26:20,434 --> 01:26:22,038
ls it not Kamalahassan's intelligence?

1518
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:24,273
Did you not steal it
from film 'Pushpak Viman'?

1519
01:26:24,367 --> 01:26:26,745
Don't call it stealing
Call it inspiration

1520
01:26:26,801 --> 01:26:28,178
Then it is ok

1521
01:26:28,234 --> 01:26:29,736
Will it be alright or not?

1522
01:26:30,001 --> 01:26:31,241
- What?
- Dagger

1523
01:26:31,301 --> 01:26:32,211
It will workout

1524
01:26:32,267 --> 01:26:35,180
ls it not universal hero's idea?
It will surely succeed

1525

Were you a cop abroad?

Devika please come

1536
01:27:32,234 --> 01:27:35,681
How did you find out
our secret so quickly?

Don't mock at me

Come here

1539
01:27:39,134 --> 01:27:40,442
Did I not tell the truth?

1540
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:45,779
Amidst the so many girls in your life
is not Devika the last one?

1541
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:49,140
Yes, she is the last one

1542
01:27:49,201 --> 01:27:53,240
To announce that publicly
I have invited all these people

1543
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:54,278
Hear me

1544
01:27:54,367 --> 01:27:56,973
About the conclusion of
my relationship with her

1545
01:28:01,567 --> 01:28:03,444
Dear friends and colleagues

1546
01:28:03,534 --> 01:28:07,346
Avery important moment in my life
to share it with you all

1547
01:28:07,434 --> 01:28:09,710
Today I have arranged
this get together

1548
01:28:09,767 --> 01:28:12,441
I have decided to get married

1549
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,606
Bride

1550
01:28:17,801 --> 01:28:20,281

Tanuja, all the best

1556
01:28:45,367 --> 01:28:48,109
It is a mere announcement

1557
01:28:48,167 --> 01:28:52,172
Officially I would let you
know the wedding date

1558

My god
Take it away

01:28:55,501 --> 01:28:56,741
Just missed

Thank you

1562
01:29:04,101 --> 01:29:07,048
Venkiti used to look at
women merely for pleasure

1563
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:08,272
There was a change in him

1564
01:29:08,334 --> 01:29:10,075
That made me shudder

1565
01:29:10,167 --> 01:29:11,077
Me too

1566
01:29:11,134 --> 01:29:13,740
The full credit for this
goes to Devika

1567
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:19,079
Her proximity changed Venkiti
without her own knowledge

1568
01:29:19,167 --> 01:29:21,204
ls it so credible?

1569
01:29:21,267 --> 01:29:25,340
She took Devika to his house
that day where he was living alone

1570
01:29:25,434 --> 01:29:29,405
The servant also said they were
together alone for 3 to 4 hours

1571
01:29:29,467 --> 01:29:30,172
That's rig ht

1572
01:29:30,234 --> 01:29:32,407
But apart from Venkiti
and Devika there...

1573
01:29:32,467 --> 01:29:34,504
...was one more person
at that house

1574
01:29:34,601 --> 01:29:38,310
Then how anything wrong
could happen magistrate sir?

1575
01:29:38,367 --> 01:29:39,368
My God!

1576
01:29:39,467 --> 01:29:40,502
Sorry sir

1577
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:44,173
I meant Venkiti's mom was
also there at that house

1578
01:29:44,234 --> 01:29:46,214
You did not ask about mom?

1579
01:29:46,301 --> 01:29:49,373
I answer only to
questions posed to me

1580
01:29:53,134 --> 01:29:56,081
My mom lights
a lamp daily and prays

1581
01:29:56,134 --> 01:29:58,375
We are going to reap
the gains of that good deed

1582
01:29:58,467 --> 01:30:01,505
We were prepared to kill
a person for 10 lakh rupees

1583
01:30:01,567 --> 01:30:04,104
Now we're going to get the money
without doing such a henious crime

1584
01:30:04,167 --> 01:30:05,373
I don't understand

1585
01:30:05,767 --> 01:30:09,305
When Harinarayanan comes to know
there is no extramarital relationship...

1586
01:30:09,367 --> 01:30:11,313
...between Devika
and Venkiti as we thought

1587
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:13,277
Will not Harinarayanan
become happy?

1588
01:30:13,367 --> 01:30:16,678
Then will he not agree to give
money he promised us?

1589
01:30:16,734 --> 01:30:18,270
- Will he?
- He will

1590
01:30:18,334 --> 01:30:21,474
His suspicions made him burn
like a volcano with in

1591
01:30:21,534 --> 01:30:24,071
In one stroke we are
going to demolish that

1592
01:30:24,134 --> 01:30:28,014
Harinarayanan would happily give
the 10 lakhs he has agreed to give us

1593
01:30:28,067 --> 01:30:32,106
Here is the 10 lakhs
the amount I promised to give you

1594
01:30:34,434 --> 01:30:36,436
My hands are shivering

1595
01:30:36,534 --> 01:30:37,512
Hold this

1596
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,079
Guruvayurappa

1597
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:47,473
What did he give you
to fabricate a fib like this?

1598
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:48,477
Who?

1599
01:30:48,534 --> 01:30:49,239
Lies?

1600
01:30:49,334 --> 01:30:51,211
It is not a lie
It is true

1601
01:30:51,267 --> 01:30:54,248
I saw it with my own eyes

1602
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:55,370
ls it not?

1603
01:30:55,467 --> 01:31:00,109
I know who is Venkiti
more than all of you

1604
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:03,204
Wedding is a camouflage for him

1605
01:31:03,301 --> 01:31:04,644
Hari, you should

1606
01:31:04,734 --> 01:31:06,236
You guys Ca" 9°

1607
01:31:06,301 --> 01:31:08,975
Our contract ends today

1608
01:31:09,067 --> 01:31:10,444
But she

1609
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:13,208
Devika would die

1610
01:31:15,734 --> 01:31:17,008
Move man

1611
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:21,340
Excuse me, madam
One minute

1612
01:31:23,401 --> 01:31:26,439
Don't shudder hearing
what I am going to say

1613
01:31:26,534 --> 01:31:30,676
Don't think your hubby is sitting
in a wheel chair like this

1614
01:31:30,734 --> 01:31:34,375
Any moment he
would kill you

1615
01:31:34,467 --> 01:31:37,346
- You have got 2 slaps
- Yes I got 2 slaps

1616
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:40,540
You could have told Devika
what really happened

1617
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,204
But she should hear me

1618
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:45,440
On one side Harinarayanan
preparing to kill his wife

1619
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,071
On the other side Devika
not prepared to listen to the truth...

1620
01:31:48,167 --> 01:31:49,737
...and is prepared
to die any moment

1621
01:31:49,801 --> 01:31:51,405
Elamuttam on another side

1622
01:31:51,467 --> 01:31:53,970
Yes in between the time I sought
from him was about to expire

1623
01:31:54,034 --> 01:31:56,640
He was also reminding me
from time to time

1624
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:58,270
Venkiti please

1625
01:31:58,334 --> 01:32:00,143
At least you must please
understand me

1626
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,237
What is your motive?
ls it cash?

1627
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:04,337
Venkiti please,
it is very serious

1628
01:32:04,434 --> 01:32:08,109
Either you are insane
or you need some good thrashes

1629
01:32:08,201 --> 01:32:10,545
Hereafter don't come to me
with such fabricated stories

1630
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,170
Venkiti what I say

1631
01:32:12,267 --> 01:32:13,439
Get out man

1632
01:32:18,567 --> 01:32:20,979
One thing is sure
He would kill Devika

1633
01:32:21,034 --> 01:32:23,571
Let him kill
She does not believe us

1634
01:32:23,634 --> 01:32:26,547
- Let her die
- That shouldn't happen

1635
01:32:27,067 --> 01:32:28,671
Devika should never die

1636
01:32:29,101 --> 01:32:32,776
Who made Harinarayanan to dislike
Devika by casting aspersions

1637
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,070
I did that

1638
01:32:34,167 --> 01:32:39,617
If Devika dies because of that
will I not have to bear the sin lifelong?

1639
01:32:39,667 --> 01:32:43,342
- We can't do anything
- No, we can

1640
01:32:43,434 --> 01:32:44,708
We only can do

1641
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:49,205
I see only one way
to stop Devika's death

1642
01:32:51,167 --> 01:32:54,307
Harinarayanan
He must die

1643
01:32:56,534 --> 01:33:00,175
He has multiplied his
suspicions on Devika

1644
01:33:00,234 --> 01:33:03,306
Now he has become
a son of psycho

1645
01:33:03,401 --> 01:33:05,779
To save a poor girl
from a person like him...

1646
01:33:06,001 --> 01:33:09,505
...we can go to any extent
I mean any extent

1647
01:33:22,401 --> 01:33:26,474
Harinarayana

1648
01:33:26,667 --> 01:33:27,702
Hari

1649
01:33:36,667 --> 01:33:38,078
Oh God!

1650
01:33:41,234 --> 01:33:45,273
He has deliberately
planned this trip to kill her

1651
01:33:45,367 --> 01:33:48,541
But that shouldn't happen
Must save her somehow

1652
01:33:48,601 --> 01:33:50,171
What if we complain
to the police

1653
01:33:50,234 --> 01:33:51,304
Police

1654
01:33:52,534 --> 01:33:53,376
Police

1655
01:33:53,434 --> 01:33:55,414
That's the only way out

1656
01:34:02,501 --> 01:34:04,708
That's howl reached the station

1657
01:34:04,767 --> 01:34:07,646
Then on the cheque cases
they not even listening...

1658
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:09,475
...or considering
what I had to say

1659
01:34:09,567 --> 01:34:12,173
...Cl Rad hakrishnan arrested
and brought me before you

1660
01:34:12,234 --> 01:34:15,044
Sir, Devika must be
somehow saved

1661
01:34:15,101 --> 01:34:17,172
I am prepared to be
in custodial remand

1662
01:34:17,234 --> 01:34:19,441
But nothing should happen to her

1663
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,173
Sir please sir

1664
01:34:25,467 --> 01:34:27,105
- Radhakrishna
- Yes, sir

1665
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:28,407
Come here

1666
01:34:29,367 --> 01:34:31,142
I am not remanding him

1667
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:33,305
lam giving him bail
On his own bail

1668
01:34:33,367 --> 01:34:35,643
Sir as per the sections
under him he is charged

1669
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:37,145
ls bail not permissible?

1670
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:40,113
Law and sections are made
to reform human beings

1671
01:34:40,167 --> 01:34:42,169
Even if thousand
criminals escape...

1672
01:34:42,234 --> 01:34:44,680
...not even a single innocent
person should be punished

1673
01:34:44,767 --> 01:34:47,577
ls the basic tenet
of our legal principles?

1674
01:34:47,634 --> 01:34:50,308
I don't think
lam doing a wrong

1675
01:34:50,734 --> 01:34:51,974
You may 9°

1676
01:34:52,034 --> 01:34:53,570
After all misunderstandings
are cleared

1677
01:34:53,634 --> 01:34:56,740
When Harinarayanan and Devika
return as new human beings

1678
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:59,440
You must also be
a witness to partake their joy

1679
01:34:59,534 --> 01:35:02,276
Sir, how will they come here?

1680
01:35:02,334 --> 01:35:04,678
They would come
We would make them come

1681
01:35:04,734 --> 01:35:08,580
Metro Consultancy's
marketing chief Devika's...

1682
01:35:08,634 --> 01:35:12,377
...suspicious husband Harinarayanan
may kill herany moment

1683
01:35:12,467 --> 01:35:15,539
Whatever be the risks involved
that crime must be stalled

1684
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17,375
This is not a request
An order

1685
01:35:17,434 --> 01:35:19,175
Order from the judiciary

1686
01:35:19,301 --> 01:35:20,177
Sir

1687
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:23,644
That was great

1688
01:35:25,767 --> 01:35:27,007
lam thankful to you sir

1689
01:35:27,067 --> 01:35:28,444
Lots and lots of
thanks for you sir

1690
01:35:28,501 --> 01:35:30,105
I have to reciprocate this

1691
01:35:30,167 --> 01:35:33,171
If you had not come
slicing those vegetables...

1692
01:35:33,234 --> 01:35:34,645
...my back would have
been broken

1693
01:35:34,701 --> 01:35:35,736
Go with fortitude

1694
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,575
I will also pray for Devika

1695
01:35:37,667 --> 01:35:39,169
- Thank you sir
- Go

1696
01:35:43,601 --> 01:35:44,773
Don't go, wait

1697
01:35:45,334 --> 01:35:47,610
What absurdity have you done?

1698
01:35:47,667 --> 01:35:50,443
If the Cl informs the press
as to what happened...

1699
01:35:50,501 --> 01:35:52,208
...will you not lose yourjob?

1700
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:55,406
Yes, then I can do full time
slicing of vegetables and fishes

1701
01:35:55,467 --> 01:35:56,741
My dear Molikutty

1702
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,041
You have only
a well built physique

1703
01:35:59,134 --> 01:36:01,239
- You don't have a heart
- That's true

1704
01:36:01,301 --> 01:36:03,076
- lfl had that
- Don't talk

1705
01:36:03,734 --> 01:36:06,305
lam arranging
a companion for you

1706
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,640
Get in

1707
01:36:08,201 --> 01:36:09,703
I said go in

1708
01:36:10,667 --> 01:36:13,113
Today I will show him who I am

1709
01:36:13,234 --> 01:36:17,205
Jesus! Make all these right

1710
01:36:17,634 --> 01:36:19,409
- Have you not gone sir?
- Where?

1711
01:36:19,467 --> 01:36:21,037
To find out Devika

1712
01:36:21,134 --> 01:36:23,774
Let her die or live
I care a damn for it

1713
01:36:24,001 --> 01:36:25,412
Sir, please don't talk like that

1714
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:27,207
Then what do you
want me to say?

1715
01:36:27,267 --> 01:36:30,271
In the thief and police game
today you have won

1716
01:36:30,334 --> 01:36:31,369
But mark my words

1717
01:36:31,467 --> 01:36:34,539
After 5 kilometres from this place,
I would apprehend you

1718
01:36:34,634 --> 01:36:36,614
Thejurisdiction of
that place is different

1719
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:37,974
Magistrate is also different

1720
01:36:38,034 --> 01:36:40,674
At least for one day I would
imprison you in sub jail

1721
01:36:40,734 --> 01:36:43,237
Sir you may imprison me
or do anything you want

1722
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:45,507
I am not interested
You may go and find her out

1723
01:36:45,567 --> 01:36:48,411
Sir, don't think you are not
the only guy in the department

1724
01:36:48,501 --> 01:36:50,071
There are officers above you

1725
01:36:50,134 --> 01:36:52,136
Let me see ifl can trace her
with their help

1726
01:36:52,234 --> 01:36:54,475
Do it man
Go and find her

1727
01:36:54,534 --> 01:36:56,036
Sir, magistrate sir
This man

1728
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:57,545
Don't go there
Come here

1729
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,443
Sir, you go this side
and find her

1730
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:00,501
Go

1731
01:37:00,601 --> 01:37:01,705
Go man

1732
01:37:03,467 --> 01:37:06,038
These guys are out
to get me fired

1733
01:37:14,634 --> 01:37:16,375
With the help of police...

1734
01:37:16,434 --> 01:37:19,506
If you hide in magistrate's house
did you think I will not come to know?

1735
01:37:19,567 --> 01:37:21,706
- You son of a dog
- No boss

1736
01:37:22,367 --> 01:37:25,644
Won't your mom come, if she
comes to know her son is dead?

1737
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:28,237
- Thrash and kill him
- You may kill me

1738
01:37:28,334 --> 01:37:31,178
But give me an opportunity
to make a call

1739
01:37:31,234 --> 01:37:33,976
Aman is coming with
10 lakhs I owe you

1740
01:37:34,034 --> 01:37:35,308
I have to tell him
he need not come

1741
01:37:35,367 --> 01:37:36,107
What did you say?

1742
01:37:36,167 --> 01:37:40,013
Afriend of mine has started
with 10 lakhs that I owe you

1743
01:37:40,067 --> 01:37:41,444
I have to tell him
not to come

1744
01:37:41,534 --> 01:37:43,571
Then tell your friend
to come with cash

1745
01:37:43,634 --> 01:37:45,375
- Tell them to leave my hands
- Leave him

1746
01:37:49,034 --> 01:37:51,241
- Hi Basheer
- You son of a pig

1747
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:54,008
Hi thank you
Thank you

1748
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:56,205
- Have you started?
- ls it to shave off your mom?

1749
01:37:56,267 --> 01:37:57,610
Where is my money?

1750
01:37:58,501 --> 01:38:01,277
Basheer! I started with
the money I owe you

1751
01:38:01,367 --> 01:38:05,008
But Pappachan sir is holding me
as a hostage before his house

1752
01:38:05,067 --> 01:38:06,978
Hello, hello

1753
01:38:07,034 --> 01:38:08,672
How does it help me?

1754
01:38:08,767 --> 01:38:11,714
If you can come here soon
you will get 10 lakh rupees

1755
01:38:11,767 --> 01:38:13,212
Come quickly

1756
01:38:15,034 --> 01:38:16,980
Have you started
with 10 lakhs?

1757
01:38:17,034 --> 01:38:19,139
Okay, I would wait here

1758
01:38:19,201 --> 01:38:20,612
Thank you

1759
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:25,439
- Will your friend come with the money?
- Sure, he will he not come flying?

1760
01:38:25,534 --> 01:38:26,604
Look there

1761
01:38:33,467 --> 01:38:35,071
Where is the money?

1762
01:38:35,434 --> 01:38:38,972
- Take out the money
- Ask them, ask them

1763
01:38:39,034 --> 01:38:41,139
- Take out the money
- Take out the money man

1764
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:42,577
- Move away man
- Don't touch me

1765
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:44,044
Give me my money

1766
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:46,409
This is not right

1767
01:38:47,101 --> 01:38:49,138
Don't show your tricks

1768
01:38:49,234 --> 01:38:51,976
My God, let them settle
it between them

1769
01:38:52,367 --> 01:38:54,040
Has the vehicle come?

1770
01:38:54,101 --> 01:38:55,375
Escape

1771
01:39:04,067 --> 01:39:06,138
What are you pondering?

1772
01:39:06,234 --> 01:39:08,714
If it is about Devika
You need not

1773
01:39:08,767 --> 01:39:10,974
Since Cl Radhakrishnan
has washed off his hands...

1774
01:39:11,034 --> 01:39:13,378
...finding her out
will be very difficult

1775
01:39:14,467 --> 01:39:16,743
- Can we get explosives?
- What?

1776
01:39:16,801 --> 01:39:18,371
I mean substance that explodes

1777
01:39:18,467 --> 01:39:20,208
They are used in temples
for fire cracker display

1778
01:39:20,301 --> 01:39:21,609
Or a rock blasting
explosive will do

1779
01:39:21,667 --> 01:39:23,237
- For what purpose?
- It is required

1780
01:39:23,334 --> 01:39:25,473
Keep some small
quantity ready

1781
01:39:32,534 --> 01:39:35,708
Dammit! Who is calling
at this midnight?

1782
01:39:38,367 --> 01:39:43,248
Sir! By tomorrow evening
in different parts of the country...

1783
01:39:43,301 --> 01:39:46,475
...there would be serious
bomb explosions

1784
01:39:46,567 --> 01:39:47,602
Jesus

1785
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:53,673
Terrorists with expertise in explosion
have planned this operation in Kerala

1786
01:39:54,301 --> 01:39:59,341
They are camping at house number 30
in Subash Nagar area

1787
01:39:59,401 --> 01:40:03,008
When I called Cl Radhakrishnan
to inform about this...

1788
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:05,011
...he insulted me

1789
01:40:05,067 --> 01:40:07,479
If the nation is shattered
in bomb explosions...

1790
01:40:07,534 --> 01:40:11,778
...he said it's like his pub ha-
said he cares two hoots for it

1791
01:40:12,034 --> 01:40:16,210
When I said I will report this to IG
he mocked at me sir

1792
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:22,080
He said IG is a moron dull head
and he can't do anything

1793
01:40:22,134 --> 01:40:23,545
ls it right sir?

1794
01:40:24,167 --> 01:40:26,238
Radhakrishna you dirty

1795
01:40:26,667 --> 01:40:30,205
Forget about it
Who are you?

1796
01:40:30,267 --> 01:40:32,338
- Acitizen
- Citizen?

1797
01:40:32,401 --> 01:40:34,677
A person with concerns
for nation's safety

1798
01:40:34,734 --> 01:40:36,475
An extraordinary citizen

1799
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:51,580
- Sir, what I want to say is
- You need not say a damn thing

1800
01:40:51,633 --> 01:40:53,544
If the country is shattered
in bomb explosions...

1801
01:40:53,601 --> 01:40:55,274
...do you care a damn for it?

1802
01:40:55,334 --> 01:40:59,009
Is thelG, I mean me
a moron dull head?

1803
01:40:59,067 --> 01:41:03,038
Unfortunately the situation is not right
Else I would have thrown you out

1804
01:41:18,301 --> 01:41:19,405
Take a snap

1805
01:41:24,134 --> 01:41:25,238
RDX

1806
01:41:26,001 --> 01:41:27,537
Nothing to suspect

1807
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:30,206
This is surely
the handiwork of Lashkar-e-Taiba

1808
01:41:36,801 --> 01:41:39,008
Apprehend him wherever he is

1809
01:41:39,067 --> 01:41:41,980
Send messages to all
stations along with photo

1810
01:41:42,067 --> 01:41:46,174
I must get him before dawn
without any damage

1811
01:41:46,234 --> 01:41:47,645
Sir this is fake and deceptive

1812
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:50,306
- We must not
- No, first obey my order

1813
01:41:50,401 --> 01:41:51,243
Sir

1814
01:42:28,301 --> 01:42:31,282
Hari, I sawa terrific dream

1815
01:42:32,667 --> 01:42:36,615
Me shooting you
while you are asleep

1816
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:38,543
Was that your dream?

1817
01:42:39,134 --> 01:42:42,240
That was not a dream
That's the reality

1818
01:42:42,567 --> 01:42:46,538
Killing people who are asleep
is not a manly act

1819
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:50,013
So it was a deliberate slip

1820
01:42:51,067 --> 01:42:53,604
What did you think?
Did you believe?

1821
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:56,648
I would tolerate you
if you and Venkiti deceive me

1822
01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:59,613
Whatever Vivenkanandan said is true

1823
01:42:59,667 --> 01:43:02,477
You must die

1824
01:43:20,001 --> 01:43:21,776
Who is Harinarayanan?

1825
01:43:45,667 --> 01:43:46,702
Sir

1826
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:53,577
You can't even stand up

1827
01:43:53,634 --> 01:43:56,308
Yet you would
terrorise people, isn't it?

1828
01:43:56,368 --> 01:43:57,312
Tell me the truth

1829
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:59,744
What are the locations
where you have planted bombs?

1830
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:01,746
What are you saying sir?

1831
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,209
Do you mean we have
planted bombs?

1832
01:44:05,267 --> 01:44:06,712
<i>Bomb'?</i>

1833
01:44:06,767 --> 01:44:09,976
- ls this pistol yours?
- Yes

1834
01:44:10,033 --> 01:44:12,673
You are an handicapped person
Why do you require a pistol?

1835
01:44:12,767 --> 01:44:16,180
- That is for myself protection
- You dirty son of a dog

1836
01:44:16,267 --> 01:44:19,043
ls planting bombs in country
yourself protection?

1837
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:20,670
I would not care
that you are a patient

1838
01:44:20,767 --> 01:44:22,303
I would beat you hollow

1839
01:44:22,367 --> 01:44:23,004
Sir!

1840
01:44:23,067 --> 01:44:24,478
Who are you man?

1841
01:44:24,534 --> 01:44:26,536
I am Vivekanandan
who made the call to you

1842
01:44:26,601 --> 01:44:29,275
- Well done Mr. Vivekanandan
- Thank you sir

1843
01:44:29,367 --> 01:44:31,643
Even the state intelligence
could not do it

1844
01:44:31,734 --> 01:44:33,304
But you have done it
single handedly

1845
01:44:33,367 --> 01:44:34,778
- But I have a doubt
-You may ask sir

1846
01:44:35,034 --> 01:44:38,345
How did you manage to learn
there secret operations?

1847
01:44:38,401 --> 01:44:41,177
Few goons followed
to attack me

1848
01:44:41,234 --> 01:44:42,338
To escape from them...

1849
01:44:42,401 --> 01:44:45,974
I entered into his house
I'll showyou invalid guy

1850
01:44:46,034 --> 01:44:49,777
Then I had to be a witness
to their terror meeting

1851
01:44:50,001 --> 01:44:51,241
It is a lie sir
It is a damned lie

1852
01:44:51,301 --> 01:44:52,780
- Look what he says...
- Shut your mouth

1853
01:44:53,001 --> 01:44:54,071
Sir one minute

1854
01:44:54,134 --> 01:44:56,774
I have come to share
another secret also

1855
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,604
- Tell me
- Please come this side

1856
01:44:58,668 --> 01:45:01,342
In the conspiracy some
others also took pan

1857
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:02,401
Who are they?

1858
01:45:04,067 --> 01:45:06,069
They are our own countrymen

1859
01:45:06,134 --> 01:45:08,978
For the sake of money
there may not be people...

1860
01:45:09,067 --> 01:45:11,172
...spying their own
nation in all countries

1861
01:45:11,234 --> 01:45:13,714
I have stored their
photos in my mobile

1862
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:14,710
Show me

1863
01:45:14,767 --> 01:45:18,112
- Who is this?
- This is Sethumathavan

1864
01:45:18,201 --> 01:45:19,509
This is Sathi

1865
01:45:20,667 --> 01:45:23,705
This is Mohan, Roopa

1866
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:28,011
- This one
- Elamuttam Pappachan

1867
01:45:41,034 --> 01:45:43,514
Com e com e
Come fast

1868
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:45,101
My God

1869
01:45:45,168 --> 01:45:47,079
Will you plant bombs
in country?

1870
01:45:47,134 --> 01:45:48,078
<i>Bomb'?</i>

1871
01:45:48,134 --> 01:45:50,045
Vivekananda

1872
01:45:50,101 --> 01:45:51,603
Tell me the truth

1873
01:45:51,667 --> 01:45:53,510
What are the places
you have targeted?

1874
01:45:53,601 --> 01:45:55,547
I swear, we don't
know anything

1875
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,705
We haven't even
seen a bomb

1876
01:45:57,801 --> 01:46:00,281
- Haven't you seen?
- My God

1877
01:46:00,334 --> 01:46:03,406
Let me see ifl can
make you tell the truth?

1878
01:46:07,334 --> 01:46:09,541
We don't know anything sir

1879
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:11,477
I wouldn't leave you
until you come out with the truth

1880
01:46:11,534 --> 01:46:13,445
- We don't know anything sir
- You can't get you, isn't it?

1881
01:46:13,534 --> 01:46:14,774
Vivekananda didn't you see this?

1882
01:46:15,001 --> 01:46:16,480
I will make you understand

1883
01:46:16,534 --> 01:46:18,639
Thrash out his nuts

1884
01:46:20,467 --> 01:46:22,777
- Tell me man
- Please don't hit him sir

1885
01:46:23,001 --> 01:46:25,106
Will you plant bombs
in the country?

1886
01:46:25,167 --> 01:46:26,009
<i>Bomb'?</i>

1887
01:46:26,067 --> 01:46:27,569
Mr. Vivekanadan what is this?

1888
01:46:27,634 --> 01:46:31,172
Tell me the truth
Where have you targeted?

1889
01:46:31,267 --> 01:46:32,507
We don't know anything sir

1890
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:35,774
- We haven't even seen a bomb
- Haven't you seen?

1891
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,708
Move that side lady
I will make you tell the truth

1892
01:46:40,634 --> 01:46:43,171
- My God!
- Where have you all?

1893
01:46:45,667 --> 01:46:47,408
I swear sir

1894
01:46:47,767 --> 01:46:49,747
It is out of my hands

1895
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:52,041
Will you plant
bombs in country?

1896
01:46:52,101 --> 01:46:52,704
<i>Bomb'?</i>

1897
01:46:52,767 --> 01:46:54,542
Come here

1898
01:46:54,601 --> 01:46:58,447
Tell me the truth
Where have you targeted?

1899
01:46:58,534 --> 01:47:00,138
I haven't seen a bomb

1900
01:47:00,234 --> 01:47:05,047
Then I would show you bomb
I would make you tell the truth

1901
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:07,671
Come out man
Tell me

1902
01:47:07,734 --> 01:47:08,508
My God

1903
01:47:08,567 --> 01:47:10,547
Sir, DGP on the line

1904
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:13,080
It is not over
I will give you some more

1905
01:47:13,134 --> 01:47:14,738
What's all this?

1906
01:47:15,001 --> 01:47:17,242
- Vivekananda
- Very glad

1907
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:24,145
When you guys deceived
and pushed me to a ditch

1908
01:47:24,234 --> 01:47:26,771
None of you thought
about a retaliation like this

1909
01:47:27,001 --> 01:47:29,311
It's all Lord
Guruvayurappan's blessings

1910
01:47:29,367 --> 01:47:32,507
For all those who were
responsible for all my problems...

1911
01:47:32,567 --> 01:47:33,978
...this is a single panacea

1912
01:47:34,067 --> 01:47:36,513
After his talk with DGP...

1913
01:47:36,567 --> 01:47:38,376
...lG would again start
thrashing you all

1914
01:47:38,467 --> 01:47:41,073
If you don't tell him the exact places
where you kept bombs...

1915
01:47:41,167 --> 01:47:43,579
...it would be a gone
case for you all

1916
01:47:45,801 --> 01:47:48,304
We haven't planted any
bombs brother in law

1917
01:47:48,367 --> 01:47:50,779
- We haven't done anything
- Haven't you?

1918
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:54,709
My life was shattered by
the bomb planted by you

1919
01:47:54,767 --> 01:47:56,337
Vivek you must forgive me

1920
01:47:56,401 --> 01:47:58,506
I only gave the gold coated
ornament through her

1921
01:47:58,567 --> 01:47:59,545
She is innocent

1922
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:02,479
You need not repay
the 10 lakh rupees to me

1923
01:48:02,534 --> 01:48:04,480
I would pacify the lenders

1924
01:48:04,534 --> 01:48:06,605
All my doubts are cleared

1925
01:48:06,667 --> 01:48:09,739
We would lead
a happy life hereafter

1926
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:13,237
It is interesting to
hear confessions

1927
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:15,302
But it is too late

1928
01:48:15,734 --> 01:48:19,546
But if you don't suffer
at least one tenth of what I suffered

1929
01:48:19,634 --> 01:48:21,375
Lord Guruvayurappan
would not pardon me

1930
01:48:21,434 --> 01:48:23,641
Our land is the paradise
of deceivers

1931
01:48:23,734 --> 01:48:25,270
That is not because
of your com petence

1932
01:48:25,334 --> 01:48:28,247
That is because
love trust and honesty...

1933
01:48:28,300 --> 01:48:31,110
...of ordinary guys like me are
exploited by you people

1934
01:48:31,167 --> 01:48:33,306
That must come to an end
It will come to an end

1935
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:35,038
This is the beginning of that

1936
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:36,010
Bye

1937
01:48:36,101 --> 01:48:38,604
I would take care
not to meet you all once again

1938
01:48:38,701 --> 01:48:40,305
What have you decided?

1939
01:48:40,401 --> 01:48:42,711
Will you people come out
with truth on your own...

1940
01:48:42,767 --> 01:48:44,474
...or should I make you
tell the truth?

1941
01:48:44,567 --> 01:48:47,377
They would tell the truth
on their own volition, isn't it?

1942
01:48:47,434 --> 01:48:51,177
Tell me where all you
have planted bombs?

1943
01:48:51,434 --> 01:48:52,310
Tell me

1944
01:48:58,034 --> 01:48:59,240
Pappachan

1945
01:49:00,467 --> 01:49:02,640
Where did you
keep the bomb?

1946
01:49:05,634 --> 01:49:09,207
- Why are you laughing?
- Nothing sir

1947
01:49:09,267 --> 01:49:12,248
I was laughing over
the games Lord plays

1948
01:49:12,334 --> 01:49:15,713
God's deed make one travel in
palanquin in just two days time...

1949
01:49:15,767 --> 01:49:18,373
On the shoulders of these dirty
guys who occupy the palace

1950
01:49:18,434 --> 01:49:20,573
The same God's
adorn with shawls

1951
01:49:20,634 --> 01:49:21,772
I am taking leave sir

1952
01:49:22,067 --> 01:49:24,377
I have to make an earnest
prayer at Guruvayurappan

1953
01:49:24,434 --> 01:49:26,675
You may go
lam proud of you

1954
01:49:26,734 --> 01:49:28,338
- Thank you sir
- Go ahead

1955
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:33,179
"He doesn't know the tale
Yet he is great"

1956
01:49:33,234 --> 01:49:35,544

recounts is a beauty"

1957
01:49:35,634 --> 01:49:38,240

any rectitude"

not known until now“

1959
01:49:40,501 --> 01:49:43,243

He is an handsome guy"

1960
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:48,079
"His sweet tongue
always gets him troubles"

1961
01:49:48,134 --> 01:49:50,239
"It is true, he is canny"

1962
01:49:50,334 --> 01:49:52,780
"He is a glutton too"

1963
01:49:53,001 --> 01:49:55,140
"He needs thick griddlecake"

1964
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:57,703
"Wants good chicken curry too"

"These drum rhythms
express joy"

1967
01:50:06,067 --> 01:50:07,205
Guruvayurappa

1968
01:50:07,801 --> 01:50:10,407
I believe the testing
period is over

1969
01:50:10,501 --> 01:50:12,777
All these days
I lived for others

1970
01:50:13,001 --> 01:50:16,107
At least for few days
I want to live for myself

1971
01:50:16,401 --> 01:50:17,573
Bless me

1972
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:23,514
Why are you leaving
without taking the bag?

1973
01:50:23,567 --> 01:50:24,545
Bag...?

1974
01:50:24,634 --> 01:50:26,272
Bag is not...

1975
01:50:26,334 --> 01:50:29,144
This tendency to
forget is not good

1976
01:50:42,767 --> 01:50:46,476
God! Are you
testing me again?

1977
01:50:46,534 --> 01:50:50,038
Or like transforming
Kuchela's hut as a palace...

1978
01:50:50,134 --> 01:50:52,444
...are you blessing me?

1979
01:50:52,534 --> 01:50:54,138
Whatever it is...

1980
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:56,771
I don't want it solely for me

1981
01:50:58,100 --> 01:51:01,104
Including this
From now on...

1982
01:51:01,201 --> 01:51:03,374
...fifty percent of
what I get is for yours

1983
01:51:07,167 --> 01:51:08,510
Mr. Vivekanandan?

1984
01:51:11,167 --> 01:51:12,202
What if...?

1985
01:51:12,634 --> 01:51:16,172
'It was not a journey
towards another testing'

1986
01:51:16,234 --> 01:51:20,205
'Those guests invited
me to a new life'

1987
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:22,280
'A life sans problems
and tragedies'

1988
01:51:22,334 --> 01:51:26,680
'Ajourney towards
a flourishing life starts here'

1989
01:51:26,767 --> 01:51:29,304
