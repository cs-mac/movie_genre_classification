Dialogue: 0,0:18:29.68,0:18:34.42,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It's incredible that you noticed Mizuhashi's peculiarity when he pitches sliders.

Dialogue: 0,0:19:27.14,0:19:29.40,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But because of the catcher's words,
Dialogue: 0,0:19:29.40,0:19:33.12,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,he will subconsciously close up the glove when he pitches a slider.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:34.58,0:19:36.71,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,That means, a peculiarity has been created.
