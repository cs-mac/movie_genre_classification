1
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:23,920
- Good morning, Patrick.
- Good morning.

2
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:41,731
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

3
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,366
- Hi, Patrick.
- Hello, David.

4
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,536
David, you might need these.

5
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,842
What time did you folks leave last night?

6
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,575
Don't even mention it.

7
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,317
Don't lose your books.

8
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,692
- So long, David.
- Goodbye, Daddy.

9
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:35,819
I have a theory that men are only honest
with each other over breakfast.

10
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:39,347
You know, before they put the armor on.
Tell me something, Coe.

11
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,758
Did my name mean anything to you
when you heard it over the phone?

12
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,563
No, I'm afraid not. Should it have?

13
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,090
I've achieved a certain degree of fame.
I'm a writer.

14
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:53,900
<i>- Ever heard of a book called Star Reach?
- No.</i>

15
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,467
<i>Disaster?</i>

16
00:02:56,543 --> 00:03:00,001
No, but then I don't get a chance
to read much fiction.

17
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:05,577
You can't expect to enlighten everybody
with two brilliant thrusts.

18
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,147
If you read anything at all...

19
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,781
<i>...you'd know that
Star Reach was serialized in the Post...</i>

20
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,156
...was Book of the Month and MGM
bought it from its galleys for a picture.

21
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,525
<i>Disaster is on the best-seller list
for 34 weeks...</i>

22
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,223
...and Fox is shooting it right now.

23
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,560
You must be very successful.

24
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,032
- I'm King Midas.
- I'm delighted to hear that.

25
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,732
I like to experiment in my work
now and then...

26
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,829
...and that can run into a little money.

27
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,231
That whimper you just heard was my wallet.

28
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,141
Maybe I picked the wrong architect.

29
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,544
Maybe. How did you happen to pick me?

30
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:39,210
I ran across this in a magazine
in a dentist office.

31
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,610
And I liked it.

32
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,147
Yeah.

33
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:47,520
That's the only house I haven't wanted
to tear down and start all over again.

34
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,391
I know what you mean.

35
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,862
Someday I hope to get my publisher
to stop sending me galley proofs.

36
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,563
Every time he does that,
I try to rewrite the whole stupid book.

37
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,765
So, how do we go from here?

38
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,572
First how much do you want to spend?

39
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,075
Like to keep it under $100,000.

40
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,111
We'll certainly do something with that.

41
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:14,017
It depends on the kind of house you want,
and whether or not we can agree on it.

42
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,079
- At $100,000, you'd disagree?
- It's possible.

43
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,351
What are you,
one of these temperamental artists?

44
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,551
If you want to call it that.

45
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:24,028
The kind of house I design
won't advertise you, it'll advertise me.

46
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,930
I can't afford to have a dull house
go up with my name on it.

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,902
You ought to understand that.
Who gets the review, you or your editor?

48
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,097
- More coffee?
- No, thank you.

49
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,436
Good hips, that girl.

50
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:40,839
All right, let's say our tastes agree,
now what?

51
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,846
I want to see your lot, of course.

52
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,147
<i>But first I'd like to read your book,
Star Reach.</i>

53
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,448
My second one was better.

54
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,751
But aren't first ones
usually autobiographical?

55
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,586
Bright boy. You do read a little.

56
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,719
Before I go to the drawing wood,
I must know everything about you.

57
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,992
So far, all I know about you
is you like coffee and hips.

58
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,863
There are some closets I don't want opened.

59
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,731
I'm no stool pigeon.

60
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,933
Suppose you think the book's lousy?

61
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,907
Let's not look for trouble before we start.

62
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,241
- There'll be plenty of that, anyway.
- Sounds like a kidney operation.

63
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,645
No, it's not that bad, really, but...

64
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,751
You know, Altar,
designing a house for somebody...

65
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,911
...that's a very personal thing.

66
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,878
I like you, Coe.

67
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,747
You like me?

68
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:27,822
I'm not sure yet. I think I will.

69
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:31,227
- I'm not asking you to marry me.
- I'd have to refuse.

70
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,899
- Hi, there, Larry.
- Hi, Felix.

71
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:46,275
Eve called. Said you forgot the meat order.
I told Harry to have it ready.

72
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,679
Thanks. How'd you like the party last night?

73
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,544
Didn't care for it very much, Larry.

74
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:55,485
Of course, I may be old-fashioned, but
I think Bud goes a little far, don't you?

75
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:56,715
How do you mean?

76
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:00,154
You know, those jokes he tells.
I took Betty right out of the room.

77
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:03,161
I'm not a prude,
but there's no place at a party...

78
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,220
...for that kind of innuendos. Suggestion.

79
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,131
- I think Bud's harmless.
- Maybe I'm just old-fashioned.

80
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,260
Maybe you are. Excuse me.

81
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,816
Miss, I think you walked off with my cart.

82
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,949
No, I'm sure I...

83
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,125
I'm sorry, I must have been daydreaming.

84
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:41,059
Don't you think it might be easier
if we wheeled it over to your cart?

85
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,692
I guess it would.

86
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:46,336
You're Patrick's mother, right?
I saw you at the bus stop this morning.

87
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,432
- I'm David's father.
- Yes, Betty Anders was talking about you.

88
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,772
- How do you like the book?
- I haven't started it yet.

89
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:56,008
- I started it, but...
- But what?

90
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,346
His women seemed false to me.
I don't know.

91
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,149
It just seemed shallow somehow,
so I never finished it.

92
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,283
- He'll be delighted to hear that.
- Do you know him?

93
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,117
I'm doing a house for him.

94
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,486
That's right, you're the architect.

95
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,330
You must be a good one.
Betty said you won a prize.

96
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,426
A long time ago.

97
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:17,034
How do you like the neighborhood?

98
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:21,538
- I thought you'd just moved in.
- Last month. It's fine.

99
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,742
People are
pretty much the same everywhere.

100
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,936
I guess that's everything.

101
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,315
I'm sorry I stole your groceries.

102
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,717
You're not so pretty.

103
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,050
I have to go.

104
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,990
Good afternoon, Mrs. Gault.

105
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,127
Nice woman. Very pleasant manner.

106
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:11,483
- I caught you. You drink your milk now.
- How much?

107
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:14,082
You drink this much,
and then you can tell me a secret.

108
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,685
- No. That much.
- Okay, let me see you do it.

109
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,497
Larry, is Mr. Altar as solemn
as he is in the picture on that book?

110
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,127
No, not at all.

111
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,272
I kind of like him, Eve.

112
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,541
I think he's willing to take a chance
and let me do the house I really want to do.

113
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,203
That's the important thing, isn't it?

114
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,214
With enough money, so I don't have
to worry about the plumbing.

115
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,647
Will that be a relief.

116
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,480
I'm glad you made a good impression.

117
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:42,919
I was afraid you'd get there
and not understand a word he was saying.

118
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,384
What do you mean?

119
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,255
I don't know. I just thought
you'd have a head this morning.

120
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,955
I've got a head. Everybody's got a head.
Have you got a head, Peter?

121
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,659
Really, Larry. You knew
you had an important appointment.

122
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,294
A couple of martinis never hurt anybody.

123
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,367
They make me amorous.

124
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:04,843
You just think they do.
Martinis don't mix with s-e-x.

125
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,440
What's x-e-x?

126
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,707
Never mind. You just drink your milk.

127
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,683
Is it like Santa Claus?

128
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,180
In a way, son.

129
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,956
Is Daddy doing a house for Santa?

130
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:25,263
No, darling, he's doing a house for a writer.
I'm glad this is what you want, Larry.

131
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,695
I'm happy.
I think it's going to be very exciting.

132
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,167
- I'm glad.
- Guess what?

133
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,662
What, Peter?

134
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,708
- Guess.
- You lost a tooth?

135
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,101
No, but I wet the bed again last night.

136
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,147
You'd better be more careful, son.

137
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,148
This wasn't on my list.

138
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:49,752
That must be...
There was a slight mix-up at the market.

139
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,087
Between me and this gorgeous blonde.

140
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,626
- Really? Who?
- Patrick's mother.

141
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,998
Margaret Gault. Betty told me about her.
I hear she's very beautiful.

142
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,134
He drags me home from the party early.
He says he's tired.

143
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:06,534
So I get all set to watch television.
But not Felix.

144
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,200
He has to carry me upstairs
like a regular hero.

145
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,676
You know, I swear that man's got
one thing on his mind day and night.

146
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:16,579
It's getting so lately that I go out
to lunch so he won't come home for lunch.

147
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,450
I guess they're all alike, though.

148
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,584
Is Ken that way?

149
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,683
Yes, he's that way.

150
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,884
There are times
when my husband bores me stiff.

151
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,792
Does Ken bore you?

152
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,593
No, never. He's always very interesting.

153
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,500
Well, a girl like you.

154
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,538
You know, you're so beautiful,
sometimes I can't even stand you.

155
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,699
Old Octopus will be home for lunch soon.
I'd better get home.

156
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,766
- Nice to meet you, Mrs. Wagner.
- Thank you.

157
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,243
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Sure.

158
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,576
- You get a chance, come on over later.
- Okay.

159
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,043
Hello?

160
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,388
You. How did you get my number again?

161
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,555
No. Never.

162
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,588
I'll call the police
if you don't stop calling me.

163
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,557
Margaret, shouldn't Patrick be home
by now?

164
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,602
Yes, he'll be home soon, Mother.

165
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,036
They keep them awfully long nowadays.
When you were...

166
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,767
If you'd rather not wait for him,
it's perfectly all right.

167
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,741
I'm sure he only gets in your way.

168
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,667
I love to have him with me.

169
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:23,112
In fact, I wish you'd let him stay all night
with me once in a while.

170
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,673
It gets awfully lonely
in the valley all by myself.

171
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,117
All by yourself, Mother?

172
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,584
Who was on the phone, dear?

173
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,217
Just one of the women. A neighbor.

174
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,920
Something wrong? You seem disturbed.

175
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:39,590
No, nothing's wrong. If you don't mind,
I've got a lot of things to do.

176
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:43,226
- If I can help in any way.
- It's a little late, isn't it?

177
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,333
- I'm interested. I simply want to...
- You're interested in me?

178
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:53,344
Don't judge me. I'm not to be judged by you.
I'm still your mother, you know.

179
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,880
- Yes, I know.
- Yes, Margaret, I am.

180
00:11:56,749 --> 00:12:00,776
And I know a little bit more about life
and living than you might imagine.

181
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,516
I imagine you know a great deal
about life and living, Mother.

182
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,516
You're a very cold person, Margaret.

183
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,821
I never could talk to you.

184
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,365
I used to wonder when it all happened...

185
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,925
...how I'd be able to explain it to you
when you were old enough to listen.

186
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:22,167
How I could make you understand what
honest-to-God love could do to a woman.

187
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,302
Of course, it was pure and beautiful.

188
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:30,276
I'm not a tramp, Margaret.
Please understand that.

189
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,916
I'm not a tramp.

190
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,216
What happened to me
could happen to any woman.

191
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,589
I don't want to hear it.

192
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,394
Do you know what I wish, Margaret?

193
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,030
I wish you'd really fall in love someday.

194
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,059
I am in love, Mother. With my husband.

195
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,337
Yes, of course.

196
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:57,069
Margaret, you married
the first nice boy that came along.

197
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,579
- Mom.
- Maybe it was my fault, but...

198
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,307
Excuse me, Mother.

199
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,528
See you later, Margaret.

200
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,755
Good morning.

201
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,961
I think we've got a box of corn flakes
that belongs to you.

202
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,898
- I read that book last night.
- How did you like it?

203
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,774
I saw what you meant. He doesn't see
the world very clearly, does he?

204
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,543
All he needs is a good house to live in.

205
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,684
Better give him lots of windows.

206
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:43,219
Say listen, I'm on my way now
to take a look at his property.

207
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,224
- Would you like to come along?
- No.

208
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,520
Just thought you might be interested.

209
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,256
- I am, but...
- It's not very far.

210
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,158
Not this morning. Thank you.

211
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,368
Maybe some other time?

212
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,340
Change your mind.

213
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,605
- Where is it?
- Bel Air.

214
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:39,878
- Is this something you do all the time?
- What do you mean?

215
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,243
I don't know, ask a perfect stranger to...

216
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:47,316
I just feel odd sitting here
with someone I don't even know.

217
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,115
I'm David's father.

218
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,020
You feel better now?

219
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,324
Suppose someone should see us?

220
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:59,262
We'll have to tell them the truth.
That we're running off to Mexico together.

221
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,865
Would you mind turning back, please?

222
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,141
Are you serious?

223
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:15,739
Yes.

224
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,874
Well, okay.

225
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:33,022
- I'm sorry. I just don't feel right.
- That's okay.

226
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,192
I saw one of your houses.

227
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,596
<i>The one in Better Homes and Gardens.</i>

228
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:44,575
I like the way the fireplace is standing
free in the middle of the room like that.

229
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,077
You know,
that's a caveman concept of architecture.

230
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,940
A roof over your head, a hole to
look out of, and a fire to huddle by.

231
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,585
It was a strange house.

232
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:58,145
- It was just an experiment.
- No, I liked it.

233
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,256
It had strength and confidence.

234
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,995
How'd you come across such an old issue?

235
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,958
Betty told me your house was in it...

236
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:11,002
...and I looked it up
in the library yesterday.

237
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:18,074
Look, this is silly.
You don't really want to go back, do you?

238
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,600
- This is it.
- It's beautiful.

239
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,366
Altar certainly picked himself a spot.

240
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,110
But it's so naked.

241
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,079
You must remember
Mexico is a very primitive country.

242
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,308
That's right.

243
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,878
Here, take this end and go out to
that point, right by that boulder there.

244
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,046
Okay.

245
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,091
- Watch out for the brush.
- All right.

246
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,354
- Will it go that far?
- Sure it will.

247
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,436
Okay.

248
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,279
- How are you going to do it?
- Do what?

249
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,542
If you put a house up here,
it'll roll right down into the street.

250
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,709
We'll have to anchor it to a cloud.

251
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:40,683
Stay right there and hold it tight
while I go over to the other side.

252
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,055
Yes, sir.

253
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,136
- I love the smell of earth.
- I do, too.

254
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,337
That about does it.

255
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:05,474
- You mean that's all?
- Just the beginning.

256
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,920
- What's it going to look like?
- I think I know.

257
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:13,821
- You've been very helpful. Thank you.
- Thank you.

258
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,233
Maybe you'd better drop me off here.

259
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:28,432
- I'll take you to your door.
- No, please. This would be fine.

260
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,571
Maybe you're right.

261
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:35,902
This okay?

262
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:37,606
Yes, thank you.

263
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,652
- I'm glad I came along.
- So am I.

264
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,481
Goodbye.

265
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,209
Who are you?

266
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,443
I was about to ask you the same question.
I'm Larry Coe.

267
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,882
- Sure. Come in.
- Thank you.

268
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,051
So you're the architect?

269
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,784
- That's who I am.
- I'm Marcia.

270
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,692
Hello, Marcia.

271
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:59,724
Let's hear some of your plans.

272
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,131
Where's Altar?

273
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,466
The genius? He's working.
Would you like a drink?

274
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,400
No, thanks. It's a little too early.

275
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,497
- Do you mind if I have one?
- No, please.

276
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,837
What's he working on?

277
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:14,673
<i>The Fall of a Stone. Do you like that title?</i>

278
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,149
Are you married or something?

279
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,923
Yes, I'm married or something.

280
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:30,917
Choke.

281
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,931
You're missing a lot, architect.

282
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,196
Maybe we both are.

283
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,203
Maybe you'd better tell Altar I'm here.

284
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,071
What, and have him snap off my head?
Do you think I'm crazy...

285
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,975
- I thought I heard you. You been here long?
- I just got here.

286
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:48,979
You still here? I thought you left long ago.

287
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:53,609
- Now, how can I leave? I'm your inspiration.
- Sure. Baby, I hate to disillusion you.

288
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:58,145
- You need all the inspiration you can get.
- Go fly a kite, will you, sweetheart?

289
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,123
- Had your breakfast yet?
- And lunch.

290
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,285
- And lunch? What time is it?
- After 3:00.

291
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,387
No wonder I'm so hungry.
I've been at this thing since 4:00.

292
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,591
- I can't get it right.
- And you won't.

293
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,894
Look, Marcia whatever-your-name-is...

294
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,869
...would it hurt your career
if you kind of cleaned up the joint?

295
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,532
My talent doesn't lie in that direction.

296
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,940
You haven't got any talent.
You don't have any talent.

297
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:22,344
I don't? You see, he gets lucky
with a couple of books...

298
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,974
...all of a sudden,
he's an important American writer.

299
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,514
I am an important American writer.

300
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:31,682
The critics said that he wrote with
facile ease, but he hasn't got a thing to say.

301
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,749
The critics. I eat them
like the pieces of cheese they are.

302
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:38,588
He's dying because they pan his books.
It kills him.

303
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:41,428
Yeah, I cry all the way to the bank, okay?

304
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,502
All right, now go someplace
and practice your fast draw.

305
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:48,602
- We're all out of Holland gin.
- And I can understand it.

306
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,642
Got to get rid of that miserable lush.

307
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,303
I'd like to go over those sketches with you.

308
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,543
Lot of laughs, that kid.
Sit down and have something to drink.

309
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:02,212
No, thanks. Let's get to work. I got
a few appointments with some builders.

310
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,118
Did you have trouble reading the sketches?

311
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:06,350
- No, I read them fine.
- Good.

312
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:11,126
It's pretty different from the house
I saw in the magazine, isn't it?

313
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,221
You didn't expect the same house, did you?

314
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,765
I don't know what I expected.

315
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,802
You're the architect,
you've said so often enough.

316
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,769
What's the matter with you all of a sudden?

317
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,601
Nothing.

318
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,508
No, there's something eating you.
What is it, Rog?

319
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:30,405
I showed your sketches
to some friends of mine.

320
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:33,315
They said I'd have to be nuts
to live in a house like that.

321
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,084
Who's going to live in it,
you or your friends?

322
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:37,985
That's not the point.

323
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:39,353
Nobody lives in a vacuum.

324
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:42,359
I don't want people pointing
to this oddball house:

325
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,156
"That's where that kooky writer lives. "

326
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,322
What do you want?
A house like everybody else's?

327
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,832
The house in the magazine
wasn't like everyone else's.

328
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,198
I designed that house
for a Fresno lawyer with kids.

329
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,531
This house is for you.

330
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:56,165
Sure. What if I have to get rid of it?
Suppose my next book flops?

331
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:59,870
And the book after that? What do I do then?
Wait for a 36-year-old writer...

332
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,106
...with a mustache to come along
so I can unload it?

333
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,081
What do you want? A guarantee
that you'll be successful always?

334
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,549
What difference does it make?

335
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:09,246
You design a house, up it goes,
you get 10%, good or bad.

336
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,119
With a book it's different.
I've got readers, I get reviews.

337
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,987
Shall I call your girlfriend back?

338
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,358
Maybe you'd like to slap her around
as I'm too busy to play scapegoat.

339
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,363
What do you mean?
I'm discussing your house.

340
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,023
Your house, Altar.

341
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,189
Forget it.

342
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,200
All right, I made a mistake.

343
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,031
When I met you, I told my wife:

344
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:32,906
"Here's a guy who'll be willing
to try something different. "

345
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:36,379
- Boy, was I wrong. You want to play it safe.
- That's not true.

346
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,383
What are you afraid of?
That some critic won't like your house?

347
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:42,545
This has nothing to do
with the lousy critics!

348
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,887
You know, Rog,
we both start with the same thing:

349
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:51,652
...a blank piece of paper.

350
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:55,466
But every time I try to play it safe,
I come up empty.

351
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,833
So now I just sit down at that drawing board
and do what I want to do.

352
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,997
And I hope what I like,
somebody else will like.

353
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,040
Maybe this isn't a great house,
I don't know.

354
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,668
Maybe somebody will think it's an oddball...

355
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,109
...but we can't try to please them all.

356
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:12,639
- You trying to say this is what I do?
- No, Rog, I don't know what you do.

357
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:17,313
I read both your books.
I like them pretty well, but...

358
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:21,657
Boy, I'd love to see what would happen
if you really broke loose.

359
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,852
Don't you think that's what I want to do?

360
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:27,365
Then do it. Write a book that you like,
and to hell with the critics.

361
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,159
You don't know.

362
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,869
Rog, I know one thing.

363
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:36,198
You've got to find out
what's important to you.

364
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,142
Sure, now this house is important to me.

365
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,275
And I was hoping you'd like it, but...

366
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:48,284
If you don't like it, we shake hands
and say goodbye. It's as simple as that.

367
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:03,231
You know something?
I think it's a great house.

368
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:10,598
Are you sure
I haven't talked you into anything?

369
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:14,268
Yeah, I think you did. Thanks.

370
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,641
There are a few improvements
I'd like to make.

371
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:20,879
- You know, this is an oddball house.
- You're an oddball character.

372
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,079
Look, let's take it one room at a time.

373
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,723
Hey, Maggie.

374
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,059
What did you call me?

375
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,831
Maggie. Why, something wrong with that?

376
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,933
No, nothing. How are you?

377
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,170
Fine. I feel just like I own
Southern California.

378
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,337
Altar just gave me the green light
on the house.

379
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:51,576
Of course, he doesn't know
it's going to roll down into the street.

380
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,550
That's wonderful. Congratulations.

381
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:57,281
I couldn't have done it without you
holding the tape. I owe you a commission.

382
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,823
How about an ice-cream cone
or a Coke or something?

383
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,925
Thanks, but I can't, really. I'm late now.

384
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:05,891
I'll owe it to you.

385
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,096
- It's going to be a very exciting house.
- Thanks, Maggie.

386
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,369
I'll see you.

387
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:17,468
- Margaret, are you home?
- Yes, I'll be out in a minute.

388
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:21,301
- Where's the mail?
- I guess I left it on the hall table.

389
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:48,660
- Hi. Did you just get home?
- No.

390
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:53,299
Why don't you get dressed?
Where's Patrick?

391
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,068
Betty's keeping him overnight.

392
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,769
I thought we could be alone.

393
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,874
I'm going to wash and change my shirt.

394
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,556
Telephone.

395
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,168
Margaret, telephone.

396
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,675
- Leave it.
- It might be important.

397
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,077
Don't answer it.

398
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,745
What's with you tonight?

399
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,278
Please.

400
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:43,580
Okay.

401
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,097
That phone's still ringing.

402
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,103
It's getting dark outside.

403
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,820
Tell me you love me.

404
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,417
Now, you know I love you, Margaret.

405
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:27,654
Don't you think I'm pretty?

406
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,763
- Of course.
- Then why don't...

407
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:36,470
Do you think of me
when you're working, Ken?

408
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:37,803
- Yes.
- What do you think?

409
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,970
- I don't know. I think of you.
- Do you think of making love to me?

410
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:44,674
- Now don't talk like that...
- How do you think of me, then?

411
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,815
Margaret, this is silly.

412
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,319
You know perfectly well
how I feel about you.

413
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,216
Tell me you want me.

414
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,158
Do you want me?

415
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:00,629
- You know I want you, Margaret.
- Then tell me. Talk to me, Ken.

416
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,188
- Honey.
- Tell me.

417
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,368
Don't you want to hold me? Hold me.

418
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:08,797
Margaret, we can't just...

419
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:10,932
- Why can't...
- Please, Margaret.

420
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,605
I'm sorry to rush things, but boy...

421
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,616
I've still got two hours of work tonight.
Always changes.

422
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:22,482
I tell you what.
Just give us a layout of the plan site...

423
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,784
...and a schematic
of one of the factory buildings...

424
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,551
...and after that, Martin can do the rest.

425
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:30,355
- Why don't you let him handle everything?
- Because it's right down your alley.

426
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,589
You won a prize
for doing almost the same thing.

427
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,895
- We're back to that again.
- I just wanted to illustrate a point.

428
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,594
That is the point. I've had it.

429
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,331
I don't want to keep doing
the same commercial designs.

430
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,464
I think the location alone
would interest you.

431
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,735
Look, I'm working on a house. I like it.

432
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,107
I can't go hopping off to Hawaii.

433
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,806
That wouldn't be necessary,
would it, Mr. Baxter?

434
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,076
Aren't there photographs
of the proposed site?

435
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,243
Sure there are. Some good ones, too.

436
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,719
I prefer to get a feel of the terrain.
You know that.

437
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,559
Actually, the terrain is no problem here.

438
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,031
We've got a good flat parcel of land.

439
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,698
- Good night, Mr. Baxter.
- Good night.

440
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:15,068
What do you say, Larry?
We figure the job is worth $3,000.

441
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:16,572
I think it's worth more than that.

442
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,768
What Larry means is
he's been getting the work...

443
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:21,835
What I mean is that I'll be working
on two jobs simultaneously...

444
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:25,371
...and trying to give them both my best.
More than $3,000.

445
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,284
Thank you, sir. Good night.

446
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:34,352
How much would you want?

447
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:36,325
I think the job's worth $5,000.

448
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:40,088
Isn't that a shade high
for something like this, darling?

449
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:44,393
I think we can go to $4,000.
What do you say, Larry?

450
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,830
- Let me think about it, Stan.
- What's there to think about?

451
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,898
Are two grown men
going to start bargaining like fishwives?

452
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:55,344
I like you, Eve. $4,500, Larry. Top offer.

453
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:59,212
- Have we got a deal?
- All right, it's a deal.

454
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,012
- Thanks a lot for dinner.
- My pleasure. I'll phone you Monday.

455
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:07,023
- Will you send the photos over?
- As soon as I can get them to you.

456
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:25,236
Why do I let myself get trapped
into doing unimportant...

457
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,834
Trapped? What do you mean?

458
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:30,244
What do you think happened tonight?
You knew I didn't want that job.

459
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,976
I knew nothing of the sort.

460
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,314
Why do you think I left Baxter and Baxter?

461
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:38,583
I was beginning to feel like a machine
turning out plastic practical jokes.

462
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,921
So again I let myself get forced
into a job that doesn't excite me.

463
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:45,326
Doesn't offer any challenge.
It's something any architect could handle.

464
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:47,864
I didn't force you into anything.

465
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,795
You're right, honey. I'm a big boy.
I could have said no.

466
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:01,270
Honey, have you any concept
of what I'm actually trying to do?

467
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,871
Apparently not. I'm just a pushy housewife.

468
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:07,111
Do you think it pleases me
that I won a prize back in 1952...

469
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:11,212
...eight years ago, and that lousy prize
has been the high point of my career?

470
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:14,087
Now you're ashamed of it?
You talk like you're ashamed of it.

471
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:17,594
No. It's just that I'm not the wonder boy
anymore. This is 1960...

472
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,754
Larry, for heaven's sake.

473
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,095
Time doesn't stand still,
you either change or you die.

474
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,896
Would you mind telling me
how this job is going to kill you?

475
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:27,938
I realize I'm terribly dense and stupid,
but I don't understand.

476
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,031
Look, for once, just try to understand.

477
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:33,844
I didn't want this job because
I want to concentrate on the Altar house.

478
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:37,176
That's something I want.
Something that excites me.

479
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:40,676
I've got things I want to state
as an architect.

480
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,516
And if I don't get them
out of me, I'll bust.

481
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,960
You know what I'm trying to say?
Do you understand?

482
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,222
I understand, Larry.
But what comes after the Altar house?

483
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:59,263
I think we should be grateful to Mr. Baxter.
Heaven knows we can use the extra money.

484
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:08,411
Linda. We're home.

485
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,078
- Hi.
- Hi, Eve.

486
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,576
Were the kids okay? Did they wake up?

487
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,208
Not a peep out of them all night.

488
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:17,277
- Who's winning?
- I don't know. Who's playing?

489
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,585
It's not quite 11:00, sis.
Do you want me to lift Peter before I go?

490
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:21,920
I'll do it, Linda.

491
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,585
- Good night, Larry.
- Good night, Hank.

492
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,492
Sis, there was one little fuss.

493
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:32,726
Daddy?

494
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:36,103
- What are you doing awake?
- Is it time for school yet?

495
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,163
No.

496
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,537
Mommy and I just got home.
Get back to sleep.

497
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:52,846
Daddy, tonight Peter was messing around
with my record player.

498
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:56,155
He broke the needle
and scratched up the record.

499
00:34:56,227 --> 00:35:00,323
And when I tried to stop him, he got mad
and threw one of his blocks at me...

500
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,229
...and almost broke the window.

501
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:05,934
And when I told Lindy,
she said it was just an accident.

502
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:08,528
But it wasn't no accident, Daddy.

503
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:13,501
- We'll have to talk to him about that.
- I think you should beat him up.

504
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,773
We'll figure something out
in the morning, okay?

505
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,577
- Okay.
- Get back to sleep.

506
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:23,182
- David?
- Yes, Daddy?

507
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:25,916
I'll drive you to
the bus stop in the morning.

508
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,014
Okay, Daddy.

509
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,060
Have you got plenty of pencils
to write with?

510
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,233
You'd better move over here.

511
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,903
You wait for him, he'll be along.

512
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,025
There he is. Hurry up, Patrick.

513
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,887
Come on.

514
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,157
There you go.

515
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:22,111
- Thank you.
- I'm going to the lot again. Come with me?

516
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,272
Thank you, no.

517
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,376
- Come with me.
- No.

518
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,373
I want to see you again.

519
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,250
Why? You don't even know me.

520
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:06,753
I want to know you.
When can you get away?

521
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,021
No, I can't. I couldn't.

522
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,618
- When?
- Don't ask me. I don't want to.

523
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,721
When? Tomorrow night?

524
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,992
- No.
- Thursday night?

525
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,170
Please don't think that I...

526
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,299
- 8:00?
- Where?

527
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,310
People will see us. Please hurry.

528
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:34,044
There's a place on the beach on the way
to Malibu. It's called the Albatross.

529
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:35,585
I'll find it.

530
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,885
Are you sure you want to see me?

531
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,186
Yes. Aren't you?

532
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,519
No, I'm not sure at all.

533
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:46,852
8:00.

534
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,909
- Patrick's sound asleep.
- Good.

535
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,709
- What time do you think you'll be back?
- 11:00, 11:30.

536
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:09,675
I don't really know, Ken. You know
how women are when they get together.

537
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,346
I know.

538
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:17,257
- If you'd rather I didn't go...
- Why, no, go ahead. Don't be silly.

539
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:20,631
I don't have to go, Ken.

540
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,496
Maybe we could get a sitter
and we could go out somewhere together.

541
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:31,533
I have a lot of papers to go over tonight.
Now you go on and have a good time.

542
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:43,316
Suppose I were going to meet another man?

543
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:44,681
Sure.

544
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:51,055
- Would it make you jealous?
- Of course it'd make me jealous.

545
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:56,927
But you don't think it's possible?
I mean, do you? That I would.

546
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,992
You're my wife, Margaret.

547
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:04,700
- It happens, you know.
- Not to someone like you.

548
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,338
I'm no different than anyone else, Ken.

549
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:10,812
I've got the same feelings,
the same passion...

550
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:14,749
- Now stop that. Don't talk like that.
- "Passion" isn't a dirty word, Ken.

551
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:18,016
Margaret, please, you know
I don't like to hear you talk like that.

552
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:19,817
Now, come on.

553
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,389
You go on and have a good time, okay?

554
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:28,965
If I'm not awake when you get home,
I'll see you in the morning.

555
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,026
- Hi, Maggie.
- Hi.

556
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,964
- I thought you weren't coming.
- I said I would.

557
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,094
- Shall we sit down?
- Sure.

558
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:31,187
- Did you have any trouble?
- No.

559
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,124
Let's not talk about it, please.

560
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,390
- Would you like a drink?
- Please.

561
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:39,493
Good. Waiter. What do you drink?

562
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:43,238
Anything. I don't care. What do you drink?

563
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:44,774
- Martini?
- Fine.

564
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,676
- Waiter, two martinis, please.
- Yes, sir.

565
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,413
It's crowded in here.

566
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:58,182
We're pretty far from home.
I don't think we have to worry.

567
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,786
- The waves are wonderful, aren't they?
- They're beautiful.

568
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,693
I got a builder for Altar's house.
A man named Di Labbia.

569
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,424
I think he'll do a good job.

570
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,223
We start next week.

571
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,532
I feel very guilty. Don't you?

572
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:17,834
Yes, I do.

573
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,309
Do you want to leave?

574
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:25,072
No.

575
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:30,142
Good. I thought we'd go through
that whole U-turn routine again.

576
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,159
Thank you.

577
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:42,424
- I'm sorry, sir.
- That's all right.

578
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:45,829
He's nervous, too.

579
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,868
- Do you like olives?
- Don't you?

580
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,133
I love them.

581
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,436
Why do you call me Maggie?

582
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,111
Doesn't everyone?

583
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:00,141
Just you.

584
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:04,017
Good, I'll be the only one
in the whole wide world to call you Maggie.

585
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:07,380
Funny that you should call me that.

586
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,626
I guess it's because
it's such an ugly name. Maggie.

587
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,920
But you make it beautiful.

588
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,295
My father used to call me Maggie.

589
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:19,262
What's your favorite name?

590
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,802
I have a lot of favorite names.

591
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,637
Tilly, Zelda, Lizzie, Brunhilda...

592
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:33,306
You've got a silly laugh.

593
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:38,185
No, I like it. You ought to
use it more often.

594
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,752
I want to laugh. I really do.

595
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,860
It's a very sexy laugh.

596
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,128
Larry.

597
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:59,006
Nothing. I just want to
try saying your name.

598
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,977
What shall we drink to?

599
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:05,576
- Everything.
- Like what?

600
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:12,785
Living, doing, being what we want to be.
That's all that's important.

601
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,981
Isn't that what everyone wants?

602
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,124
What do you want?

603
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,199
I want to make love you to you.

604
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:35,342
Do you know how I feel right this minute?

605
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,107
That I'm...

606
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,373
I'm sorry, I just can't.

607
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,411
Don't.

608
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,081
Please don't.

609
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:00,360
Don't start this.
If you start this, you'll just...

610
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:04,333
Please don't. Don't kiss me.
Please don't kiss me.

611
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:08,094
If you kiss me, I'll...

612
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:14,066
Yes.

613
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:11,123
Mom.

614
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,903
- Can I have some more milk, please?
- All right.

615
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:08,749
- What does Altar want this time?
- He thinks the study isn't big enough.

616
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,020
I won't be too long, dear.

617
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,618
Leave his number, will you?
In case I have to reach you.

618
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:15,290
- He isn't listed, you know.
- Sure.

619
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,600
I'll leave it here by the telephone.

620
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,283
- Good night, dear.
- Good night, darling.

621
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:22,492
Hey, Mr. Coe.
What's the matter? You don't trust me?

622
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,431
You got to go up on the roof to check?

623
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:27,493
I don't trust anybody
who wears leather elbow patches.

624
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,630
I'm gonna lose my shirt on this job.

625
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:33,699
- I figure I underbid by at least $5,000.
- Don't come weeping to me.

626
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:36,245
I never weep except in church.

627
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,873
But just watch me
when I start cutting corners.

628
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:40,476
Don't cut corners on me.

629
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,519
Remember, you're a bugler.
You play the song the way I wrote it.

630
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,579
Without me,
your song don't get played at all.

631
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:49,217
- I'm a very important guy.
- Good.

632
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:57,827
I'll get it, Ken.

633
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:01,826
Hello?

634
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:07,910
No, I can't right now.

635
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,518
Maybe in a few hours.

636
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:23,884
Bye.

637
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,829
- Who was that, Margaret?
- Betty Anders.

638
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:22,046
Did you kill anyone?

639
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:26,620
I don't know. It's hard to tell
when everyone's shooting at once.

640
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:28,318
I know.

641
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:31,225
Ken said the same thing. He was in the...

642
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:34,890
He was in the infantry, too.

643
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:38,597
I didn't like the Army at all,
except for the people I met.

644
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:41,604
There was one man in my outfit.

645
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:44,697
He was a magician in civilian life,
and he kept all his...

646
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:46,299
How did you meet Eve?

647
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,377
At a dance.

648
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:50,938
He kept all his tricks in his footlocker.

649
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:53,244
One day the CO came through
with some top brass...

650
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:55,113
Is she a good dancer?

651
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,382
Yes, she's a good dancer.

652
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,280
I hate to dance.

653
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,356
When did you meet her?

654
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:07,125
While I was still in the service.
Home on furlough.

655
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,726
Did you like her right away?

656
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:13,992
Yes, I did.

657
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:19,174
Look, Maggie, you know,
people aren't born married.

658
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,873
They meet, date, go steady, get engaged...

659
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:24,573
...the whole natural progression
that you and Ken...

660
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:26,172
Why are we talking about this?

661
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,343
- You love her very much, don't you?
- Come on, Maggie.

662
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:33,287
- Is it painful for you to talk about her?
- No, but I don't see why we keep on...

663
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:36,757
- Is she very bright, Larry?
- Yes, she is.

664
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:38,658
Do you think she's pretty?

665
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,864
What's the next question?
"Is she better than me?"

666
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,627
Go ahead, ask it.

667
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:47,599
I'd never ask that.

668
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:51,100
Why not? You've asked everything else.

669
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:54,976
I guess I'm afraid of the answer.

670
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:05,820
Maggie, you never have to be afraid
of anything. Never.

671
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,020
Kiss me.

672
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:30,771
What are you two guys doing?
Figuring out new ways to chisel me?

673
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,179
- Hiya, Rog.
- Daphne, Larry Coe.

674
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,615
- How do you do?
- Mr. Di Labbia.

675
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:35,981
- Hello.
- Want her number?

676
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:38,919
- Honey, everybody's got my number.
- Yeah, I know.

677
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,418
- This sure is exciting, isn't it?
- Don't pay any attention to her.

678
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:46,360
A checker game is exciting.
Crazy legs, though.

679
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:49,626
This little group of beavers running around.
What's this costing me?

680
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:50,961
Not enough, Mr. Altar.

681
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:53,832
- It looks like a big prison.
- Excuse me, I have some work.

682
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:56,532
What difference does it make?
You're King Midas, remember?

683
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:58,665
Sure. I'm beginning to
feel like your patron.

684
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:01,108
Getting the money from the publisher
with one hand...

685
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,079
- And giving it to you with the other.
- How is the book coming?

686
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:05,978
- I turned it in last week.
- Good.

687
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:09,382
Rog let me read all the best parts.
It's wonderful.

688
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,581
It's just like poetry.

689
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:14,019
All right if I go look at your house now,
Mr. Coe?

690
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:16,718
- Certainly.
- Sure, baby, you can go look at my house.

691
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:17,953
Your house.

692
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:20,596
Listen, you know the entrance
to the dining room?

693
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:24,031
Can it wait until tomorrow?
You know, I didn't expect you today...

694
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,362
I'm late now. Okay?

695
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:29,269
- What is it, a blonde or brunette?
- Neither.

696
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,807
Bald and 50, another potential patron.

697
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,241
What's the matter?
Don't you like the house anymore?

698
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:36,541
Of course I do.
What kind of a crack is that?

699
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:39,878
It's just that it's hard being enthusiastic
all by myself.

700
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,575
I'm sorry, Rog. Can you stop by tomorrow?

701
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:44,847
We'll walk through the whole thing
step by step...

702
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:46,650
- And work over the rough spots.
- Sure.

703
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,658
- I got a few extras.
- No extras. No more extras.

704
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,854
- I'll see you tomorrow. You'll like them.
- This is expensive wood.

705
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:30,556
You see, I thought I'd put
the shutters on the outside...

706
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:33,501
...see, so they stand out from the house
like this.

707
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,867
Don't you hate people
who draw on tablecloths?

708
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:36,928
Yes.

709
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,937
- Anyhow, you'll be able to...
- How do you shave that?

710
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:42,808
How do I shave what?

711
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,574
- That.
- It's very simple.

712
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:50,450
You see, I have a tiny little razor
with cylindrical blades.

713
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,317
And I put it here like this,
and I shave it very fast.

714
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:56,486
Oh, you.

715
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:04,259
I gotta call Ken. I promised I would.

716
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:06,560
I'll be right back, okay?

717
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:17,138
- Where did you and Harry go last night?
- We went to a new place.

718
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:18,976
I don't know...

719
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:21,379
One of those coffee houses.

720
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,964
- Did you want anything?
- Shove off.

721
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:43,305
- Look, Margaret...
- The lady's with me. You'd better leave.

722
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:46,501
You're not her husband, mister.
Why don't you shove off?

723
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,474
What's the matter with you?

724
00:55:58,888 --> 00:55:59,980
All right.

725
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:05,692
It's over.

726
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:10,126
All right, it's all over.

727
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:16,700
Are you all right, Maggie?

728
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:19,704
Yeah, I'm all right.

729
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:25,507
We'd better get out of here.

730
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:34,823
What did he want?

731
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:40,292
- How did he know your name?
- He didn't.

732
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:43,966
- He did. He called you Margaret. I heard...
- You must have been mistaken.

733
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:46,593
- I heard him.
- I never saw him before in my life.

734
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:47,693
How did he know your name?

735
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:51,468
- What was this "It's all over... "
- Can we stop this, please?

736
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:04,084
Maggie. What is it?
Is the truth so terrible?

737
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,448
You sure you want to hear it?

738
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:12,387
Yes. I want to hear it.

739
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:16,162
All right.

740
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,359
It was this last summer.

741
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:22,664
July.

742
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:28,377
Ken was away on a business trip,
and Patrick was staying with my mother.

743
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:30,205
I was alone.

744
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:33,545
Forget it, Maggie. I've no right to know.

745
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,349
But you have to know, don't you?

746
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,018
It was very hot that day.

747
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:44,516
I was sitting out front
when a truck went by.

748
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:48,122
The driver waved and he smiled at me.
And I smiled back.

749
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:51,630
- He was the driver?
- Yes, he was the driver.

750
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,498
He came back the next night.

751
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:57,870
I was ironing and he rang the doorbell
and asked for a glass of water.

752
00:57:57,941 --> 00:57:59,909
He said he was thirsty.

753
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:04,936
I didn't see any harm in it,
so he came in and he stayed awhile.

754
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:08,610
I was so grateful to
have someone to talk to.

755
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:11,543
So we talked.

756
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:13,714
He said he was driving the truck
for his father.

757
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:16,759
- They had a rug-cleaning business.
- So what happened?

758
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:18,291
He kissed me.

759
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:22,994
We were standing at the door,
saying good night.

760
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,296
Suddenly he grabbed me.

761
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:28,367
He was trembling all over like a baby.

762
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:31,399
What are we making such a fuss about?

763
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,832
There's more, Larry.

764
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,280
I got ready for bed after he left.

765
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:42,984
I was in bed when the phone rang.
It was him.

766
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,447
He said he was coming over.

767
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:51,059
I told him he was crazy, that I was in bed,
that I'd call the police.

768
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:56,397
- But he said he was coming over.
- Why didn't you call the police?

769
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:00,464
I have a young son.

770
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:05,741
I locked all the doors instead.

771
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,706
- Then I took some sleeping pills and I...
- Sleeping pills?

772
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:12,509
When you knew he was on his way,
you took sleeping pills?

773
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:15,745
I wanted to sleep. I wanted to hide.

774
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:21,954
Go ahead.

775
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:28,126
I was almost asleep
when I heard his car pull up.

776
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:31,527
He rang the front doorbell,
but I didn't answer it.

777
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:35,730
The pills were beginning to work. I couldn't
have gotten out of bed if I wanted to.

778
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:39,938
Then I heard him trying the kitchen door.

779
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,103
Then I heard the door open.

780
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:45,738
You said you'd locked it.

781
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:49,448
I did, but somehow he was in the house.

782
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,553
He called "Margaret" from the kitchen.

783
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:57,392
I lay there half-drugged, unable to move.

784
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:02,290
Then I heard his footsteps in my room.

785
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,799
And I couldn't move.

786
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:10,402
I tried to fight him, Larry.

787
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:12,906
I tried. Can you understand that?

788
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:16,244
No, I can't.
Why'd you take those sleeping pills?

789
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:20,173
- I wanted to sleep. I wanted to hide.
- Why'd you leave the door open?

790
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:23,707
- I thought it was locked.
- A door is either locked or it isn't.

791
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,278
You wanted him inside that house.

792
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:29,189
You didn't want to hide or sleep.
You wanted him to find you.

793
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:32,091
You took those pills
to make it easy for yourself.

794
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:34,491
And you wanted what happened.

795
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:39,158
All right, Larry. I wanted him.

796
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:43,463
That's what you really
want to hear, isn't it?

797
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,707
I wanted him.

798
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:51,041
You...

799
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,926
Would you please come in and settle this?

800
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:50,871
Pete got paste all over David's model,
and now David is yelling bloody murder...

801
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:54,535
- And I can't do a thing with either.
- All right. I'll be right out.

802
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:22,528
Daddy, I'm gonna kill him.

803
01:02:22,605 --> 01:02:25,597
He smeared up my whole model.
It took me three days to make it.

804
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:29,543
- Don't worry, I'll clean it off for you.
- But he's always doing things like that.

805
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:32,672
- Peter's younger than you are.
- I know, but he's got his own toys.

806
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,149
- He lets you use his toys, doesn't he?
- Yes.

807
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:38,278
- You should learn to share things with him.
- Okay.

808
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:48,930
- Hey, Larry, tell Eve to call.
- Sure.

809
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,902
Come on, kids.

810
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:42,479
- Yes?
- Hello. I'm Larry Coe.

811
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:45,985
My wife missed Mrs. Gault
at the bus stop this morning...

812
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:48,546
...and asked me if I'd... Is anything wrong?

813
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:51,188
- I'm Margaret's mother.
- Hello.

814
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,750
- Come in, Mr. Coe.
- Thank you.

815
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:57,027
Margaret went to bed with a fever last night.
I came from the valley to give her a hand.

816
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:58,532
I'm sorry to hear that.

817
01:03:58,601 --> 01:04:01,695
- You say you're neighbors, are you?
- Yes. We live down the street.

818
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:04,467
- Patrick goes to school with my son.
- How nice.

819
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:09,039
- Is this your day off, Mr. Coe?
- No, I'm an architect.

820
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:12,748
- I work at home mostly.
- How very convenient.

821
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:15,550
- Who is it, Mother?
- It's Mr. Coe, dear.

822
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:17,617
Why don't you go on in?

823
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,882
I'm just fixing some coffee.
Would you like a cup?

824
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:21,947
Thank you. That'd be very nice.

825
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:36,065
Maggie, I'm sorry.

826
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:45,271
Larry, you have to know,
you have to understand that...

827
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:50,251
I don't have to know anything.

828
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:52,585
I love you.

829
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:56,584
And I love you.

830
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:00,591
And I want to kiss you.

831
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:03,764
- You'll catch my bug.
- I don't care.

832
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:09,665
- When will I see you? Will you call me?
- When will you be all right?

833
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,569
I'm fine now.

834
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:21,878
I didn't know what you took in your coffee,
Mr. Coe, so I brought all the fixings.

835
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:24,044
- What does he take, Margaret?
- Just...

836
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,246
Just cream.

837
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:50,370
So it happened to you?

838
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:56,615
Yes, Mother. It's happened to me.

839
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:25,138
You know how to read a blueprint.
That's not the way the wall was designed.

840
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:28,672
- But I got it half-finished already.
- I can't help that. Take it down...

841
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:30,218
- Anybody home?
... And do it right.

842
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:31,310
Hi, honey.

843
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:34,185
- All right, fellas, hold it.
- Anything wrong?

844
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:37,853
I just came to see my husband
and his house.

845
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:40,725
- Good. How do you like it?
- I think it's wonderful, darling.

846
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:42,627
- What is that?
- That's Altar's study.

847
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:46,099
Don't you remember I... No.
The sketches, that was on the main level.

848
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:50,195
- I think it's more interesting there.
- It's marvelous. What a view.

849
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:52,737
- How do you get up there?
- This is the stairwell.

850
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:55,333
The steps on this side go into the study
on that side...

851
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:58,847
...they go into the master bedroom.
All that is going to be colored glass.

852
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:02,441
This is the exciting part, isn't it?
When it begins to take shape.

853
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:05,385
- Are you happy with it?
- Yes. I think it's going very well.

854
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:07,684
- Let me show you the rest of it.
- No, I can't now.

855
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:10,590
I've got too many things to do.
We're having a party tonight.

856
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:11,921
A party? What's the occasion?

857
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:15,657
It's no occasion. I just thought of it
this morning after you left.

858
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:19,667
I don't know, you've been working
on this all week, and it's Friday night...

859
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:23,000
...and I just thought a little fun
wouldn't hurt us.

860
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:25,104
I thought you might like to relax.

861
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:27,739
So I'm giving a party.

862
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:30,244
- You don't mind, do you?
- No, it's good idea.

863
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:32,177
- A little sudden.
- Good.

864
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:36,810
I asked Felix to save us some good steaks,
and I've already started calling people...

865
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,411
...and I'm so glad you don't mind.

866
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:44,456
I've got to go and call some more people,
and I've got to pick up some things.

867
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:47,956
It's a beautiful house, darling.

868
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:51,791
- Goodbye. I'll see you later.
- Goodbye, dear.

869
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,199
- Don't be late tonight.
- I won't.

870
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:05,412
<i>- Hello?
- Is this Margaret Gault?</i>

871
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,642
Yes, this is Margaret Gault.
Who's this, please?

872
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:09,081
<i>This is Eve Coe.</i>

873
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:12,720
Hello? Margaret?

874
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:14,584
<i>Are you there?</i>

875
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:18,187
Yes, I'm here, Mrs. Coe.

876
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:22,060
<i>- Are you all right? Is anything wrong?
- No, I'm fine.</i>

877
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:26,399
Betty Anders has spoken of you so often...

878
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:29,165
<i>...and I've been meaning to call you
for such a long time.</i>

879
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:32,903
Now finally I've gotten around to it.
And I was wondering...

880
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:35,535
...if you and your husband
might like to come over tonight.

881
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:36,908
We're having some friends in.

882
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:40,676
<i>I'm sure you must know some of them
and we'd so much like to have you.</i>

883
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:44,947
That's very sweet of you.
I don't know if we could get a sitter.

884
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,284
<i>I've got a whole list if you want it.</i>

885
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,724
Ken's very fussy about the sitters we use.

886
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,385
I can understand that.

887
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:55,826
If you do get a sitter, could you come?

888
01:08:56,665 --> 01:08:58,132
I'll ask him.

889
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:01,734
<i>- He may have made other plans.
- Do try.</i>

890
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:04,338
If you can come,
we'll look for you around 8:00.

891
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:05,873
<i>- All right?
- Fine.</i>

892
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,543
<i>- Goodbye, Margaret.
- Goodbye.</i>

893
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:20,987
- Good night, Mr. Baxter.
- Good night, David. Sleep tight.

894
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,691
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, David.

895
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:28,696
- Drink up, Stan. You look a little tired.
- I should be.

896
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:31,232
I've been commuting to Hawaii
for the past two months.

897
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,495
- Oh, yes.
- They look beautiful.

898
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:37,462
Larry, that schematic you did for us,
it was a great job.

899
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:41,101
- I'm glad you're satisfied.
- As it turns out, it was just the beginning.

900
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:44,112
- Yeah?
- Something new has come our way, Larry.

901
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,581
I think it was offered to us
largely on the strength of the job you did.

902
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:48,947
What is it?

903
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:50,882
- Just a city.
- What?

904
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:52,818
There'll be a city, a city in Hawaii.

905
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:55,857
We're going to substitute a city
for 4,000 acres of jungle.

906
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,119
That's exciting.

907
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,457
Housing, roads, industrial parks,
the works...

908
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:02,725
...just as Sert did in South America
on a limited scale.

909
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:05,961
- How does it sound?
- It sounds like an architect's dream.

910
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:08,035
You sending Martin out for it?

911
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:13,437
He can't handle it. We want you
to head up the entire project for us.

912
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:15,636
Me?

913
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:22,415
- Well?
- I don't know what to say.

914
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:26,018
- I'm flabbergasted.
- It's very simple. Just say you'll do it.

915
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:29,387
We figure it'll take about five years
of intensive planning.

916
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:32,859
But, Larry, this one will go down
in the architectural primers.

917
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:34,919
I can't tell you how grateful we are.

918
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:37,830
My brother said that schematic you did
had more imagination...

919
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,334
...than anything that Bauhaus
ever came up with.

920
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:44,839
- He just doesn't throw praise around.
- Five years. That's a long time to be away.

921
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:47,967
Away? From what?
You'll have Eve and the kids with you.

922
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:52,707
And boy, will your kids love Hawaii.
It'll be great for me having you there, too.

923
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:54,542
You know how we love Eve.

924
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:57,677
Do me a favor, will you?
Don't mention this to Eve.

925
01:10:57,786 --> 01:11:00,880
- I'd rather tell her myself.
- Sure, Larry, I understand.

926
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:03,083
When are you going to put on those steaks?

927
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:06,389
- Any time now.
- No, not yet. Not until everybody gets here.

928
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:10,162
- I hope those steaks are good, Felix.
- Cut them from the cow myself.

929
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:11,290
I'll answer the door.

930
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:14,700
The way I figure it, Ramsey
should begin telling one of his jokes...

931
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,466
...right after his next martini,
wouldn't you say?

932
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:38,892
Darling, you already know Margaret.

933
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,553
- How do you do?
- Yes. Nice to see you.

934
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:42,927
- You haven't met my husband, Ken.
- Glad to know you.

935
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:45,660
Will you get them both a drink?
I'll put your coat away.

936
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:46,928
Fine. Thanks.

937
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:49,232
I think you know everybody here.

938
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:57,207
- Hi. Have we got any crme de menthe?
- I think it's somewhere down there.

939
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:05,285
- How's it going out there?
- Why don't you come and take a look?

940
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:08,488
I will. After this batch,
everybody's on their own.

941
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:10,684
Go a little easy on that, will you?

942
01:12:10,759 --> 01:12:13,284
- First drink tonight.
- I want you sober.

943
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:16,729
- I'm sober. Sober as a judge.
- Stay that way.

944
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:19,761
- How come?
- Guess.

945
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:25,132
You want a lawn like a golf course,
you gotta work at it.

946
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:27,971
You know what I hate? Crab grass. I hate it.

947
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:33,074
I've found the crme de menthe. I wasn't
sure whether we had any left or not.

948
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:36,709
- What are we girls talking about?
- Girl talk. Sit down.

949
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:40,550
I like good-looking people. Men and women.

950
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:42,816
All the girls around here,
they all look alike.

951
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:46,486
They wear tweed skirts, cardigan sweaters,
and pearls. It's dreary.

952
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:48,890
That Soren character who lives next door...

953
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:51,592
I think she must wear a girdle
up to her neck.

954
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:57,194
I can't tell them apart,
like celery and carrots.

955
01:12:57,272 --> 01:13:00,070
- I want to make people happy.
- Felix. What can I do for you?

956
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:02,133
- Nothing. Thank you very much.
- Surprise?

957
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:04,202
- Are you happy?
- Yes, thank you.

958
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:09,074
So the next morning,
the circus owner goes up to the horse...

959
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:12,279
...and he says "What's this I hear
about you and that zebra?"

960
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:15,118
The horse looks up, he's surprised, he says:

961
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:18,022
"Zebra? I thought those were pajamas. "

962
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:20,527
I didn't think it was funny
the first time I heard it.

963
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:22,223
Wait a minute. I got more.

964
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:29,863
How old is your son now?

965
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:32,633
- He's the same age as your son.
- That's right.

966
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:36,239
- Isn't that a nice picture, Margaret?
- Yes.

967
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:39,905
Larry did a house for the artist
about eight years ago, I think.

968
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:42,847
Excuse me, Mrs. Gault. Shall we dance?

969
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:48,819
Larry, tell me something.
What's your secret?

970
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:50,449
Your lawn, no crab grass.

971
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:53,586
I've tried six different crab-grass killers
and none of them work.

972
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:56,358
I even tried this new stuff
that's got 90% chlordane.

973
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,525
Who cares about crab grass?

974
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:02,229
I don't care if crab grass devours
your whole lawn or this entire community.

975
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:04,431
- That's a fact.
- I'm sorry if I...

976
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:07,100
This whole house may suddenly collapse
around our ears...

977
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:09,201
...and all you want to
talk about is crab grass.

978
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,644
What you need is another drink.
Give me your glass...

979
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:14,580
I'll get you a drink
and we'll toast to the weeds of the world.

980
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:15,639
Sure, Larry.

981
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:17,878
...picked that man up
and took him to the room...

982
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,682
...and gave him a spanking he won't forget.

983
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:22,223
My husband will not tolerate
that kind of language.

984
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,781
Not even from a 6-year-old.

985
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:26,020
It's hard to know what to do with them.

986
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:29,495
A man works hard all day long.
He comes home tired and angry...

987
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:32,625
- And he's supposed to be a good father.
- And a good husband.

988
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:36,228
Yeah, but that's easier.
Margaret understands a man's moods.

989
01:14:36,338 --> 01:14:37,862
Children can't.

990
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:40,167
Are you a moody man, Ken?

991
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:43,234
Not excessively so.
I think I'm a good husband.

992
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:45,575
I haven't heard any kicks so far.

993
01:15:35,397 --> 01:15:36,489
Hi.

994
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:40,329
The bartender told me
to give this to the lady.

995
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:42,326
With his compliments.

996
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:46,700
And this.

997
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,102
Thank you.

998
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:52,473
Why'd you come, Maggie?

999
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:55,276
I had to.

1000
01:15:57,019 --> 01:15:58,281
Are you angry?

1001
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:02,380
- Would it matter if I were?
- Yes.

1002
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:05,286
But I would have come anyway.

1003
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:12,224
So this is where you work?

1004
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:15,163
Yes, this is where I miss you most.

1005
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,004
Larry, please.

1006
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:23,069
- Maggie. I want to tell you...
- What?

1007
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:26,512
- Did you ever build a city?
- No.

1008
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:29,547
No, neither did I.

1009
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:33,519
Ain't that a shame. I never built a city.

1010
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:37,757
Have you ever been to Hawaii?

1011
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,758
You'd better not drink any more, Larry.

1012
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:43,856
Yeah, that's what Eve said.

1013
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:46,260
That's remarkable, don't you think?

1014
01:16:48,537 --> 01:16:52,166
She's lovely, Larry. I like her.

1015
01:16:58,046 --> 01:17:01,243
- I want to hold you.
- Larry, don't, please.

1016
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:04,280
I want to say...

1017
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:10,916
Here you are, Margaret. Ken's been looking
for you. He wants to go home.

1018
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:13,018
Thank you very much, Felix.

1019
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:17,361
- Good night, Larry. It was a lovely party.
- Good night.

1020
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,466
- Good night, Felix.
- Good night, Margaret.

1021
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:23,237
Pretty woman.

1022
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:26,500
Yes, she's a real pretty woman.

1023
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:30,568
I've always envied you, you know, Larry.
Working at home, I mean.

1024
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:39,340
Hi.

1025
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:42,378
Hi. Who are you?

1026
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:44,879
- Where's Mommy?
- She's outside.

1027
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:48,821
- Would you like me to get her for you?
- No, that's all right.

1028
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:52,350
You still haven't told me your name.

1029
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:54,395
Peter Coe. What's yours?

1030
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:59,389
- Maggie.
- You're pretty.

1031
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:07,007
- See you soon, Larry.
- Yeah.

1032
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:09,600
- Call. Come over.
- I will. I'll call you tomorrow.

1033
01:19:09,678 --> 01:19:11,509
The nicest part about being the host is...

1034
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:14,310
...you don't have to drive anywhere
at the end of the night.

1035
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:16,475
- It has its advantages.
- Larry.

1036
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:18,743
- Good night.
- I really had a wonderful time.

1037
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:21,789
- Larry, it was a great party.
- Thank you very much.

1038
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:24,257
- Good night, Margaret.
- Good night.

1039
01:19:24,726 --> 01:19:27,217
- Glad you could have come.
- Eve, thank you.

1040
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:29,590
I certainly will, dear. Goodbye.

1041
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:32,326
It's the same with working at home, Larry.
The way you do.

1042
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:36,860
You got a three-minute walk from your
breakfast table to your study. That's living.

1043
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:41,969
And, of course, you also get a chance
to watch the procession.

1044
01:19:43,311 --> 01:19:46,872
- What procession is that, Felix?
- The great American marching society.

1045
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:49,712
The Itchy Foot Club. Tramp, tramp, tramp.

1046
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:52,182
You know who's leading
the procession, of course.

1047
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:53,949
- Who?
- A woman.

1048
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:57,214
You don't think much of women,
do you, Felix?

1049
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:59,726
I love them. Every last one of them.

1050
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:02,762
But they're all the same.
They want romance.

1051
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:06,790
There's nothing romantic about the slob
they see shaving in his pajamas.

1052
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:09,803
You and me, Larry,
we're furniture in our own homes.

1053
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:13,136
But if we go next door...
Next door, we're heroes.

1054
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:18,310
A guy like you, works at home, you got
plenty of opportunity for going next door.

1055
01:20:20,448 --> 01:20:22,916
Sure. I go next door all the time.

1056
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:26,886
A lovely lady of 60 lives there.
Let's have some coffee, Felix.

1057
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:31,953
Larry, you know what I'm talking about.
Romance. The romance seekers.

1058
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:36,396
They're everywhere,
ready to fall in love at the drop of a hat.

1059
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:39,796
Any place you've got a housewife,
you've got a potential mistress.

1060
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:43,065
How do you know? You're the guy
that doesn't even like a dirty joke.

1061
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:44,435
I'm a realist.

1062
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:47,669
Society says,
"Felix, you're a one-woman man. "

1063
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:50,538
I say, "Yes, of course I am. "

1064
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:52,203
You want to know something, Larry?

1065
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:55,647
I'm a liar. So are you. So is everybody.

1066
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:57,878
- What are you getting at, Felix?
- Nothing.

1067
01:20:57,953 --> 01:21:00,683
I'm just an observer of the human scene.

1068
01:21:01,556 --> 01:21:05,583
A guy like you, the blondes
must come flocking from miles around.

1069
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:08,494
Sure, I beat them off with clubs.

1070
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:10,426
Never mind the clubs.

1071
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:14,433
Just make sure they don't leave
any blonde bobby pins around in the car.

1072
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:16,732
Eve's hair is black, remember?

1073
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:21,469
And watch the ashtray.
No lipstick butts that aren't Eve's brand.

1074
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:24,946
Or maybe your particular blonde
doesn't smoke?

1075
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:30,014
You've got the wrong man, Felix.
I'm happily married with two kids.

1076
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:33,248
Sure, we're all happily married
with two kids.

1077
01:21:33,822 --> 01:21:35,847
What's that got to do with your blonde?

1078
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:39,291
She's happily married, too,
but maybe with only one kid, huh?

1079
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:42,194
- Love them all.
- What are you doing, Felix?

1080
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:46,064
Me? I'm a respectable ex-butcher,
my conscience is clear.

1081
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:48,193
So is mine. Good night, Felix.

1082
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:52,237
Outraged innocence
is always a good gimmick, Larry...

1083
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:55,101
...but the amateur tends to overplay it.

1084
01:21:56,478 --> 01:22:00,471
The pro, Larry, is a guy who establishes
a definite behavior pattern at home...

1085
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:03,176
...and never deviates from it, but never.

1086
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:06,982
No sly secret glances
when your wife's at the same party...

1087
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:09,780
...no trips to the kitchen for a quick kiss.

1088
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:11,490
Kid stuff.

1089
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:14,217
The pro doesn't take any real chances.

1090
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:16,856
You're taking a real chance
right now, Felix.

1091
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:20,766
- I'm liable to bust you right in the mouth.
- Are you? I doubt it.

1092
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:26,300
Then you'd have to tell Eve that we were
discussing your blonde, wouldn't you?

1093
01:22:26,708 --> 01:22:30,735
And Eve's pretty close
to smelling something in the wind, anyway.

1094
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:35,542
I spotted that worried-wife look on her face
when I came in.

1095
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:39,746
That's why she threw
this little shindig, Larry.

1096
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:43,386
To draw the straying male
back to hearth and home.

1097
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:48,553
Now you take my advice and make love
to her the minute everybody leaves.

1098
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:51,155
- That's enough, Felix.
- Don't worry, Larry...

1099
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:53,325
...your secret's safe with me.

1100
01:22:53,535 --> 01:22:55,366
I'm just an ex-butcher, pal.

1101
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:58,668
"See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. "

1102
01:23:00,575 --> 01:23:02,770
You and your blonde don't have to worry.

1103
01:23:02,844 --> 01:23:05,312
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

1104
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,677
Don't I?

1105
01:23:14,689 --> 01:23:17,021
Good night, Larry. Nice party.

1106
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:01,629
Larry?

1107
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:06,770
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. What do you mean...

1108
01:24:06,841 --> 01:24:10,538
- Something's wrong, Larry. Now what is it?
- I said nothing.

1109
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:14,014
I don't want to start an argument.

1110
01:24:15,283 --> 01:24:16,773
Neither do I.

1111
01:24:21,523 --> 01:24:24,617
My folks are going to Palm Springs
this weekend.

1112
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:27,486
I think I'll go with them.

1113
01:24:28,763 --> 01:24:31,254
- You mean alone?
- Yes, alone.

1114
01:24:32,267 --> 01:24:35,031
I have some things I want to think about.

1115
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:38,703
- Do you mind my going?
- No, not if you want to.

1116
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:42,140
- Do what you want to do.
- Do you want me to go alone?

1117
01:24:42,343 --> 01:24:44,971
- I want to go down that drain.
- What?

1118
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:48,072
Nothing. Sure, go ahead, honey.

1119
01:25:48,877 --> 01:25:51,004
- This is my little brother Peter.
- Hello, Peter.

1120
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:53,172
Hi, Maggie.

1121
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:58,183
- Is Eve with you?
- No, she went to Palm Springs.

1122
01:25:58,253 --> 01:26:00,448
- What ride you kids want to go on next?
- That one.

1123
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:03,457
Okay. Come on.
Do you want to go on this, too?

1124
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:05,816
You got your ticket, Pat?

1125
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:19,701
You look beautiful.

1126
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:24,835
Why did she go away, Larry?
Is something wrong?

1127
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:28,174
No. She just wanted a few days' rest,
that's all.

1128
01:26:29,284 --> 01:26:31,718
Do you think she might return the courtesy?

1129
01:26:31,786 --> 01:26:32,946
What do you mean?

1130
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:36,582
- Maybe she'd let you get away for a while.
- Maybe.

1131
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:39,252
You'd like to, wouldn't you?

1132
01:26:41,829 --> 01:26:43,353
Hold on, Peter.

1133
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:47,497
You didn't answer me, Larry. What's wrong?

1134
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:55,203
The thing we should have expected
sooner or later.

1135
01:26:55,677 --> 01:26:57,770
Felix knows about us, Maggie.

1136
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:02,377
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1137
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:08,181
Then we'll have to be more careful,
won't we?

1138
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:10,816
I don't think he'll cause any trouble.
Men don't gossip.

1139
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:13,827
That's not the point.
But who's going to find out next?

1140
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:15,692
Don't you see what can happen?

1141
01:27:15,763 --> 01:27:19,494
This whole thing could explode around us
and hurt a lot of people.

1142
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:23,333
I don't want to hurt anyone, Larry.
Not you, not me. Not anyone.

1143
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:27,204
Of course not. That's why we've got to know
where we're going.

1144
01:27:30,144 --> 01:27:34,604
There's got to be more for us or less.
It can't stay the way it is.

1145
01:27:34,682 --> 01:27:36,343
Don't talk about it, Larry.

1146
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:40,148
What do you mean, "Don't talk about it"?
We've got to face up to it sometime.

1147
01:27:40,221 --> 01:27:44,214
- I want things to stay the way they are.
- Without going anywhere?

1148
01:27:45,159 --> 01:27:49,721
Like that ride our kids are on? Around
and around, no beginning and no end?

1149
01:27:51,165 --> 01:27:53,065
Do you want to end it?

1150
01:27:55,803 --> 01:27:58,863
- Maggie, I want to begin it.
- It has begun.

1151
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:03,476
Larry, it's got to stay exactly like it is.

1152
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:06,810
- You can't mean that.
- I do.

1153
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:11,678
I feel like I'm talking to a stranger.

1154
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:15,320
Maybe you are.

1155
01:28:24,532 --> 01:28:28,024
Maybe we should stay away
from each other for a while.

1156
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:32,606
If that's what you want.

1157
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:37,701
Come on, the ride's over.

1158
01:28:52,894 --> 01:28:57,524
First you said the 17th, I said all right.
Then you extended it to the 28th.

1159
01:28:57,598 --> 01:29:00,066
- Now you're telling me it'll be later.
- Be reasonable.

1160
01:29:00,134 --> 01:29:02,261
I've got the men working
Saturdays and Sundays.

1161
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:04,897
I don't want to hear
about your construction problems.

1162
01:29:04,972 --> 01:29:05,961
Believe me, I'm doing...

1163
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:09,032
You promised it'd be ready
by the time Altar's book is finished.

1164
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:11,271
That's the middle of next month. This is...

1165
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:14,315
I want a certificate of occupancy by then,
and no excuses.

1166
01:29:14,382 --> 01:29:17,476
- All I can do is try.
- You'd better do a lot more than try.

1167
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:20,043
I'm giving you an absolute deadline.
You meet it.

1168
01:29:20,121 --> 01:29:23,420
- What are you so steamed up about?
- So I'm a temperamental artist.

1169
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:25,482
I'm trying to get you into your house
on time.

1170
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:28,290
A couple of days more or less
won't do any harm.

1171
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:31,355
- What's that?
- The proof of my new book jacket.

1172
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:32,791
It's attractive.

1173
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:36,166
I'm beginning to sweat already.
The reviews are coming out soon.

1174
01:29:36,237 --> 01:29:38,205
- Did you write the book you wanted to?
- Yeah.

1175
01:29:38,272 --> 01:29:39,296
They'll like it.

1176
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:40,705
- Rog.
- Yeah.

1177
01:29:42,176 --> 01:29:47,079
Look, I know my 10% doesn't buy your soul,
but you okay?

1178
01:29:47,315 --> 01:29:51,081
Sure, I got a few things on my mind.
It'll be okay.

1179
01:29:52,086 --> 01:29:54,077
- You know where I live.
- Thanks.

1180
01:29:54,255 --> 01:29:55,847
Rog, I'm hungry.

1181
01:29:56,424 --> 01:30:00,360
Yeah, you're hungry.
She's a very oral type. Always hungry.

1182
01:30:01,929 --> 01:30:04,193
Still, she's a nice kind of a kid.

1183
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:08,759
She's clean.
Washes my socks, listens to my lousy jokes.

1184
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:12,764
Maybe I ought to marry her.
My mother was clean.

1185
01:30:25,987 --> 01:30:27,181
Morning, Eve.

1186
01:30:27,955 --> 01:30:29,217
Hi, Felix.

1187
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:31,080
- Nice day.
- Beautiful.

1188
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:33,189
- Hiya, fellas.
- Hi.

1189
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:39,864
Love them all, Brucie.

1190
01:30:40,701 --> 01:30:43,829
I have to wait until the neighbors call
to find out where you are.

1191
01:30:43,905 --> 01:30:46,430
- But you said I could go.
- Now listen to me.

1192
01:30:46,507 --> 01:30:50,170
I got better things to do
than to go chasing all over looking for you.

1193
01:30:50,244 --> 01:30:52,144
Do you understand that?

1194
01:30:52,513 --> 01:30:55,346
- Do you understand that, Patrick?
- Yes, Mom.

1195
01:31:06,527 --> 01:31:07,858
- Hello.
- Eve?

1196
01:31:08,062 --> 01:31:11,031
<i>- This is Stan Baxter.
- Hello, Mr. Baxter. How are you?</i>

1197
01:31:11,098 --> 01:31:13,157
Fine, thanks. Is Larry there?

1198
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:16,132
No, I'm sorry, he's not.
Can he call you back?

1199
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:21,167
He was supposed to call me yesterday.
Have you got a minute, Eve?

1200
01:31:21,242 --> 01:31:23,107
Why, yes, certainly.

1201
01:31:24,078 --> 01:31:26,478
I know Larry asked me not to discuss this
with you...

1202
01:31:26,547 --> 01:31:29,675
...but I just have to have an answer
on this Hawaiian deal.

1203
01:31:30,785 --> 01:31:32,810
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I...

1204
01:31:32,887 --> 01:31:35,617
<i>Of course, this is something
you must decide together...</i>

1205
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:37,988
<i>...but I honestly don't understand
his hesitation.</i>

1206
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:54,630
There you are.

1207
01:31:54,742 --> 01:31:56,676
- Where are the kids?
- Visiting.

1208
01:31:56,777 --> 01:31:59,803
- Visiting where?
- Lois Lindsey picked them up.

1209
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:03,980
Stan Baxter phoned.

1210
01:32:07,822 --> 01:32:09,414
What did he want?

1211
01:32:10,424 --> 01:32:12,392
What did he want, Larry?

1212
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:17,954
I'm listening.

1213
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:26,137
- Why didn't you tell me about his offer?
- I wanted to think about it.

1214
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:28,732
- Alone? I thought we were married.
- Don't get upset.

1215
01:32:28,809 --> 01:32:31,369
Why didn't you tell me?
Why did you keep it from me?

1216
01:32:31,479 --> 01:32:34,744
I'm not keeping it from you.
I want to think about it for a while.

1217
01:32:34,815 --> 01:32:37,807
For how long? He told me
you've been stalling him for five weeks.

1218
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:39,375
- Please.
- He thought I was to blame.

1219
01:32:39,453 --> 01:32:41,444
Eve, please stop shouting.

1220
01:32:42,657 --> 01:32:43,885
I'll do as I please.

1221
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:47,621
If you can hide something as important
as this from me, for God's sake...

1222
01:32:47,695 --> 01:32:49,185
- I don't know...
- It's important.

1223
01:32:49,263 --> 01:32:52,255
I want to get my own ideas clear
before I talked to you about it.

1224
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:54,699
- When did you start doing that?
- I've always done it.

1225
01:32:54,769 --> 01:32:57,135
- It was my impression...
- Your impression is wrong.

1226
01:32:57,204 --> 01:33:01,140
...and don't you tell me I'm wrong.
This time you're wrong, dead wrong.

1227
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:05,008
How could you hide something as important
as moving to Hawaii for five years?

1228
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:07,377
Selling the house,
taking the kids out of school.

1229
01:33:07,448 --> 01:33:11,714
I can't discuss this with you if you'll
scream. I have got to go to Altar's.

1230
01:33:12,119 --> 01:33:14,815
- We'll talk about this later.
- Don't you leave this house.

1231
01:33:14,889 --> 01:33:17,483
If you do, you don't have to come back.

1232
01:33:20,328 --> 01:33:23,593
I'm going and I'll be back.
We'll discuss it then.

1233
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:37,977
Larry, you old son of a gun.
Larry, what are you doing up here?

1234
01:33:38,045 --> 01:33:39,808
- Did you read the reviews?
- They came in?

1235
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:43,873
Did they come in.
100% percent they came in.

1236
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:47,020
Every one of them, and I broke their backs.

1237
01:33:47,355 --> 01:33:50,222
"Scintillating, bright, penetrating. "

1238
01:33:50,424 --> 01:33:51,982
"A work of art," the man said.

1239
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:55,358
- That's wonderful. Congratulations.
- Yeah. I'm a genius.

1240
01:33:56,731 --> 01:33:59,666
I've been sitting up here saying to myself:

1241
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,291
"Great. You did it. "

1242
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:08,705
What did I do?

1243
01:34:10,745 --> 01:34:14,613
All my life,
I've been wanting to write a book...

1244
01:34:14,682 --> 01:34:17,412
...without caring what they say. I did it.

1245
01:34:17,885 --> 01:34:19,284
They loved it.

1246
01:34:20,621 --> 01:34:23,715
All those years,
this is what I've been wanting.

1247
01:34:23,791 --> 01:34:27,158
But it turns out this is not
what I've been wanting at all.

1248
01:34:27,228 --> 01:34:29,560
- Funny, huh?
- Come on, Rog. You wrote a great book.

1249
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:31,723
I wrote a magnificent book.

1250
01:34:35,736 --> 01:34:37,795
And I sat up here alone...

1251
01:34:38,806 --> 01:34:42,367
...and drank to the wonderful reviews.

1252
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:45,911
All alone.

1253
01:34:49,316 --> 01:34:51,181
What's the matter with me, Larry?

1254
01:34:51,252 --> 01:34:55,052
Nothing the matter with you.
You should be happy. Snap out of it.

1255
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:58,717
That's the old Larry I like.
That's the one. "Snap out of it. "

1256
01:35:00,895 --> 01:35:03,955
Do you remember what you told me
when I was writing the book?

1257
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:07,660
You said,
"You decide what's important and do it. "

1258
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:10,133
- You remember that?
- That was a long time ago.

1259
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:11,967
Yeah, but it's true.

1260
01:35:12,807 --> 01:35:15,469
- You know what's important to me, Larry?
- What?

1261
01:35:16,110 --> 01:35:17,805
Nothing.

1262
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:22,774
And I could bust out crying
because nothing's important.

1263
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:26,315
- Tell me, Larry, what's important?
- Cut it out, Rog.

1264
01:35:26,387 --> 01:35:28,378
Boy, I envy you.

1265
01:35:30,357 --> 01:35:34,623
You're married and got a family.
You know where you're going.

1266
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:37,492
Sure.

1267
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,531
Sure I do.

1268
01:35:42,903 --> 01:35:44,666
You know what's waiting when I get home?

1269
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:47,401
A bomb about to explode
and I got no place to hide.

1270
01:35:47,475 --> 01:35:48,533
You want answers?

1271
01:35:48,609 --> 01:35:51,908
Give me some, and stop crying
because you got rave reviews.

1272
01:35:51,979 --> 01:35:54,209
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

1273
01:35:54,515 --> 01:35:57,848
Don't ask me what's important,
because I don't know.

1274
01:35:58,819 --> 01:36:00,480
I'm such a phony.

1275
01:36:01,756 --> 01:36:04,589
I got a drawer full of manufactured labels:

1276
01:36:05,259 --> 01:36:07,693
Architect. Husband. Father. Man.

1277
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:12,529
I sew them into my clothes,
but the suits never fit.

1278
01:36:15,069 --> 01:36:18,698
You know,
I always believed in honor, decency.

1279
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:21,938
Maybe they're just labels, too.

1280
01:36:31,285 --> 01:36:32,718
What is it?

1281
01:36:36,924 --> 01:36:40,792
I got a job I want to take, a woman I want.

1282
01:36:42,396 --> 01:36:44,227
People can't be hurt.

1283
01:36:47,668 --> 01:36:50,398
I'm hardly the one to pass out advice...

1284
01:36:51,939 --> 01:36:53,930
...but don't lose your head.

1285
01:36:54,508 --> 01:36:56,738
You didn't invent infidelity.

1286
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:01,973
You ever been in love, Rog?

1287
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:04,708
Really in love?

1288
01:37:07,321 --> 01:37:09,881
Yeah. I just want to hear her voice.

1289
01:37:11,091 --> 01:37:15,653
You know, the most important thing
in the world to me right now is a telephone.

1290
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:17,798
There's one in the other room.

1291
01:37:19,567 --> 01:37:22,058
- I couldn't pick it up.
- Why not?

1292
01:37:24,405 --> 01:37:27,169
Because if I do, that's the beginning...

1293
01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:30,872
...or the end.

1294
01:37:33,314 --> 01:37:35,282
I've never been in love.

1295
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:39,351
But I'd like to feel that way about a woman.

1296
01:37:40,554 --> 01:37:43,785
And if you do, don't throw it away.

1297
01:37:45,092 --> 01:37:46,889
It's not that easy to find.

1298
01:37:58,439 --> 01:38:00,464
Here are your house keys.

1299
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:05,508
I feel like I just had a baby.

1300
01:38:07,147 --> 01:38:08,944
You know what I'm going to do?

1301
01:38:09,016 --> 01:38:12,577
I'm going out in that street
and fall in love with the first girl I see.

1302
01:38:12,653 --> 01:38:16,248
Then I'll drag her up to my new house,
and she'll cook scrambled eggs...

1303
01:38:16,323 --> 01:38:20,282
...and love me if I never wrote
another lousy book as long as I live.

1304
01:38:20,361 --> 01:38:22,022
Yeah, you do that.

1305
01:38:22,963 --> 01:38:24,590
I better go.

1306
01:38:25,266 --> 01:38:26,756
You know, it's funny.

1307
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:30,337
We meet as strangers
and then half the time we part that way.

1308
01:38:30,404 --> 01:38:33,999
Yeah, and if we ever really get to know
another human being, it's a miracle.

1309
01:38:34,074 --> 01:38:35,439
I like you, Altar.

1310
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:40,674
I get the feeling that I'm not going
to be seeing much of you anymore.

1311
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:44,047
- Take care of yourself, will you?
- I will. You, too.

1312
01:38:59,667 --> 01:39:00,827
Hello?

1313
01:39:04,038 --> 01:39:05,437
Larry, is it you?

1314
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:10,470
How are you?

1315
01:39:10,978 --> 01:39:12,570
How've you been?

1316
01:39:16,016 --> 01:39:17,074
Yes.

1317
01:39:18,185 --> 01:39:20,016
I've missed you, too.

1318
01:39:22,523 --> 01:39:23,854
All right.

1319
01:39:27,194 --> 01:39:28,627
I don't know.

1320
01:39:29,763 --> 01:39:33,164
I just don't know, Larry.
We'll have to talk about it.

1321
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:37,229
I can't now. I'm late.
I'm supposed to pick up my mother.

1322
01:39:39,239 --> 01:39:42,231
Yes, tomorrow would be fine. Where?

1323
01:39:44,244 --> 01:39:47,338
Really, is it finished?
I can't wait to see it.

1324
01:39:49,516 --> 01:39:51,848
2:00. And then we'll talk.

1325
01:40:02,062 --> 01:40:03,427
I love you.

1326
01:40:24,752 --> 01:40:26,185
- Betty.
- Yeah?

1327
01:40:27,588 --> 01:40:30,819
I'm going over to Ramsey's,
see if I can have these shears sharpened.

1328
01:40:30,891 --> 01:40:33,519
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

1329
01:41:04,825 --> 01:41:07,385
Hello, Eve. It's starting to rain.

1330
01:41:10,631 --> 01:41:12,258
Larry's not home.

1331
01:41:14,468 --> 01:41:16,333
I didn't figure he was.

1332
01:41:16,537 --> 01:41:18,732
I wanted to talk to you, anyway.

1333
01:41:20,207 --> 01:41:22,767
If you'll forgive me, Felix...

1334
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:26,208
I'm just not in the mood right now
for talking.

1335
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:28,578
This won't take very long, Eve.

1336
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:33,181
I just wanted to find out
what you did with those geraniums.

1337
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:36,215
Geraniums? What do you mean?

1338
01:41:36,423 --> 01:41:37,754
Out front.

1339
01:41:38,025 --> 01:41:40,220
You handle the gardening around here,
don't you?

1340
01:41:40,294 --> 01:41:41,283
Yes.

1341
01:41:41,562 --> 01:41:43,894
They're coming along beautifully.

1342
01:41:43,964 --> 01:41:46,455
Betty and I wanted to plant some...

1343
01:41:46,867 --> 01:41:49,165
...but we wanted to know first...

1344
01:41:50,838 --> 01:41:52,829
Your hair looks different, Eve.

1345
01:41:54,141 --> 01:41:56,268
I was just about to take a shower.

1346
01:41:57,244 --> 01:41:59,337
I won't keep you very long.

1347
01:42:00,414 --> 01:42:03,781
Why don't you let your hair fall free
around your face, Eve?

1348
01:42:04,184 --> 01:42:06,345
You have such a lovely face.

1349
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:09,419
Thank you.

1350
01:42:11,425 --> 01:42:16,021
Felix, all we did with those flowers was
follow the nursery instructions, that's all.

1351
01:42:17,164 --> 01:42:19,257
When did you start to plant them?

1352
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:22,568
I don't know. This spring, I think.
I don't know.

1353
01:42:22,636 --> 01:42:25,503
Why don't you ask Larry when he gets back?

1354
01:42:26,507 --> 01:42:29,635
Larry may not get back
for quite some time, Eve.

1355
01:42:32,546 --> 01:42:35,242
Why don't you take off the ribbon, Eve?

1356
01:42:36,717 --> 01:42:40,585
Listen, Felix, I don't have time
for this kind of foolishness.

1357
01:42:41,588 --> 01:42:43,215
Take it off, Eve.

1358
01:42:55,068 --> 01:42:56,262
There.

1359
01:42:57,704 --> 01:42:59,365
Isn't that better?

1360
01:42:59,773 --> 01:43:02,640
I think I'd better turn on some lights.

1361
01:43:03,577 --> 01:43:05,272
What for?

1362
01:43:05,345 --> 01:43:08,143
It's getting dark outside.

1363
01:43:10,551 --> 01:43:12,519
It's really coming down.

1364
01:43:14,087 --> 01:43:17,250
Do you like to watch a storm, Eve?
I love storms.

1365
01:43:18,325 --> 01:43:21,692
Listen, Felix,
I've got a lot of things to do.

1366
01:43:23,297 --> 01:43:26,391
Was it very painful, Eve?
Taking off the ribbon?

1367
01:43:29,236 --> 01:43:30,225
No.

1368
01:43:30,804 --> 01:43:32,897
- Was it?
- No.

1369
01:43:39,313 --> 01:43:41,144
Now, why don't you...

1370
01:43:46,286 --> 01:43:49,050
Come on, Eve, you want to and I know it.

1371
01:43:50,157 --> 01:43:51,385
Get out!

1372
01:45:03,930 --> 01:45:05,488
Eve, what is it?

1373
01:45:06,366 --> 01:45:07,424
Felix.

1374
01:45:55,449 --> 01:45:59,510
Tell me, architect.
How am I any different from you?

1375
01:46:28,849 --> 01:46:30,214
Did you find him?

1376
01:46:33,987 --> 01:46:35,147
Yeah.

1377
01:46:38,592 --> 01:46:40,685
I've been sitting here wondering...

1378
01:46:40,761 --> 01:46:45,630
...what gave Felix the peculiar notion
that I'd be an easy mark.

1379
01:46:49,269 --> 01:46:51,169
Do you know why, Larry?

1380
01:46:53,774 --> 01:46:56,174
It seems so simple.

1381
01:46:57,411 --> 01:47:00,175
It explains so many things. So simple.

1382
01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:01,407
Don't touch me.

1383
01:47:01,481 --> 01:47:03,608
- Eve, please.
- What, Larry?

1384
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:05,646
I know.

1385
01:47:08,955 --> 01:47:11,150
I guess I've known all along.

1386
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:16,558
There is another woman.

1387
01:47:17,164 --> 01:47:19,029
I knew it.

1388
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:33,538
I want you to leave the house, Larry.

1389
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:37,846
I don't want you near the children.
I don't want to see you.

1390
01:47:39,553 --> 01:47:42,954
I want to forget that I ever loved you
or knew you.

1391
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:47,192
I just want you to go.

1392
01:47:48,195 --> 01:47:50,288
Go wherever you want to go.

1393
01:47:51,364 --> 01:47:54,390
Do whatever you want to. Go with her.

1394
01:47:55,969 --> 01:47:58,733
Go to hell. Just get out of my sight.

1395
01:49:02,669 --> 01:49:04,637
Can't you be happy here?

1396
01:49:11,311 --> 01:49:12,676
Is it me?

1397
01:49:16,583 --> 01:49:20,747
Because if it is me, Larry,
I want you to tell me where I was wrong.

1398
01:49:21,588 --> 01:49:23,055
I can change.

1399
01:49:24,090 --> 01:49:28,322
It's just that I don't... It's just
that I don't know what I should do.

1400
01:49:28,828 --> 01:49:31,558
- Please don't cry, Eve.
- I can't help it.

1401
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:35,368
Larry, I want us to be
the way we used to be.

1402
01:49:35,769 --> 01:49:38,260
I don't understand what's happened.

1403
01:49:38,805 --> 01:49:41,831
I don't know us anymore. Where are we?

1404
01:49:42,275 --> 01:49:43,708
I don't know, Eve.

1405
01:49:53,153 --> 01:49:55,018
Larry, please help me.

1406
01:49:55,255 --> 01:49:59,885
You see, I don't think
I could live without you.

1407
01:50:00,794 --> 01:50:02,318
Please, Larry.

1408
01:50:05,265 --> 01:50:06,926
Don't leave me.

1409
01:51:48,702 --> 01:51:51,694
I've been peeking in windows.
It's beautiful.

1410
01:52:00,613 --> 01:52:02,274
It's been so long.

1411
01:52:03,383 --> 01:52:05,715
Do you know how long it's been?

1412
01:52:09,155 --> 01:52:10,247
Yes.

1413
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:28,038
I'm going away.

1414
01:52:33,546 --> 01:52:34,706
Where?

1415
01:52:36,616 --> 01:52:38,106
To Hawaii.

1416
01:52:43,123 --> 01:52:45,148
I'm going to build a city.

1417
01:52:50,096 --> 01:52:51,495
You're all going?

1418
01:52:56,736 --> 01:52:58,135
Of course...

1419
01:52:59,939 --> 01:53:01,907
...it has to be that way.

1420
01:53:03,443 --> 01:53:05,502
There's so much to say...

1421
01:53:06,312 --> 01:53:08,007
...and yet there's nothing.

1422
01:53:16,156 --> 01:53:18,647
Don't you have a key to this house?

1423
01:53:23,897 --> 01:53:26,297
Yes, I guess there's one here someplace.

1424
01:53:27,333 --> 01:53:30,427
I left a key here for Di Labbia.
Where is it?

1425
01:53:57,797 --> 01:53:59,788
It is an exciting house.

1426
01:54:02,335 --> 01:54:05,099
There are some things I'd like to change.

1427
01:54:08,474 --> 01:54:10,533
Poor Mr. Altar.

1428
01:54:11,978 --> 01:54:14,446
He doesn't know this is really our house.

1429
01:54:18,451 --> 01:54:20,749
You know what I'd do if we lived here?

1430
01:54:22,121 --> 01:54:24,612
No. What would you do?

1431
01:54:27,193 --> 01:54:30,060
I'd build a moat around this place.

1432
01:54:32,165 --> 01:54:33,894
Keep the whole world out.

1433
01:54:35,869 --> 01:54:38,997
No friends? No visitors?

1434
01:54:39,672 --> 01:54:41,606
No one. Just you and me.

1435
01:54:47,914 --> 01:54:49,609
I do love you, Maggie.

1436
01:54:51,217 --> 01:54:52,650
I know that.

1437
01:54:54,888 --> 01:54:56,412
And I love you.

1438
01:55:00,493 --> 01:55:02,017
Mr. Coe, is that you?

1439
01:55:03,129 --> 01:55:04,391
Hi, Frank.

1440
01:55:05,164 --> 01:55:07,598
I figured I'd stop up
and have another look around.

1441
01:55:07,667 --> 01:55:09,396
Maggie, this is Mr. Di Labbia.

1442
01:55:09,469 --> 01:55:11,334
- How do you do?
- Hello.

1443
01:55:11,638 --> 01:55:14,163
You know, I really got a kick
out of this house.

1444
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:16,333
I never built one like it before.

1445
01:55:16,409 --> 01:55:19,845
I've got to check up on a few items.
Excuse me.

1446
01:55:20,413 --> 01:55:23,041
You've got quite a husband, Mrs. Coe.

1447
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:34,425
Goodbye, Larry.

1448
01:56:02,655 --> 01:56:04,054
Bye, Maggie.
