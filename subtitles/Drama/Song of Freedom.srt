1
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:34,761
There have been shots fired.

2
00:00:34,864 --> 00:00:36,856
Total civil unrest is happening
throughout the Los Angeles area.

3
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:37,936
Dozens of police
are running down the streets.

4
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:38,232
Dozens of police
are running down the streets.

5
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,498
Smoke reigned over the entire city.

6
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,611
We're telling anybody
who's in downtown South Central...

7
00:00:42,746 --> 00:00:44,271
There are 38 dead and more than...

8
00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:46,544
The EMT are having
a hard time getting in...

9
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:52,830
...where truck driver Reginald Denny
was pulled from his vehicle...

10
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:56,465
The city resembles a war zone.

11
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:58,200
Crowds gathered
at Parker Center downtown.

12
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,302
...here in Hollywood, where
looters have struck many businesses.

13
00:01:01,413 --> 00:01:03,884
There have been 3, 600 structural fires.

14
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,418
Thick, black smoke rising
from the countless fires

15
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:12,057
in Hollywood, downtown, Compton,
Watts and Long Beach...

16
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:32,266
In America,

17
00:01:33,273 --> 00:01:35,539
a girl can be crowned a princess

18
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:39,848
for her beauty and her grace.

19
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:46,189
But an Aztec princess
is chosen for her blood...

20
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,657
Eva?

21
00:01:51,172 --> 00:01:53,802
...to fight for her people,
as Papi and his father fought

22
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,541
against those who say
we are less than they are,

23
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,950
who say we are not equal in beauty
and in blessings.

24
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:09,638
It was the first day of school,

25
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,506
and I was waiting for my father
to take me to the bus.

26
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:13,841
Roberto!

27
00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:19,390
Eva!

28
00:02:20,193 --> 00:02:22,823
And I saw the war for the first time.

29
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:25,736
Eva! Eva!

30
00:02:26,037 --> 00:02:27,665
Police! Open up!

31
00:02:29,844 --> 00:02:32,144
They took my father for retaliation.

32
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:33,949
He was innocent, but they took him,

33
00:02:34,052 --> 00:02:36,386
because he was respected
by my people.

34
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,623
They called my people a gang
because we fight for our America.

35
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:42,194
On your feet!

36
00:02:44,103 --> 00:02:46,471
When I got my initiation
into the gang life,

37
00:02:46,574 --> 00:02:48,703
I became third generation.

38
00:02:49,714 --> 00:02:52,116
They beat you so you won't break.

39
00:02:53,688 --> 00:02:55,453
They are my family.

40
00:03:01,336 --> 00:03:04,638
In Long Beach, it all comes down
to what you look like.

41
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:07,577
If you're Latino or Asian or black,

42
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:36,501
you could get blasted any time
you walk out your door.

43
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:38,368
We fight each other for territory.

44
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:41,966
We kill each other over race,
pride and respect.

45
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:45,308
We fight for what is ours.

46
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,993
They think they're winning
by jumping me now,

47
00:03:52,096 --> 00:03:54,396
but soon they're all going down.

48
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,037
War has been declared.

49
00:03:58,508 --> 00:04:00,535
- Here's your coffee.
- Thank you.

50
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,848
I brought my lesson plans.
I'd love it if you'd look them over.

51
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:10,521
Yes, and these are the classes
you'll start with.

52
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,094
Freshman English, four classes,
about 150 students in all.

53
00:04:19,814 --> 00:04:21,579
Some of them
are just out of juvenile hall.

54
00:04:21,685 --> 00:04:25,522
One or two might be wearing ankle cuffs
to monitor their whereabouts.

55
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,597
And you see here,
we'll have to revise your lesson plans.

56
00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:32,568
And if you look at their scores,
these vocabulary lists

57
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:36,576
and some of these, the books,
Homer's The Odyssey,

58
00:04:36,678 --> 00:04:38,272
they're gonna be too difficult for them.

59
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:39,383
All right.

60
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:41,410
Also, for most of them to get here

61
00:04:41,522 --> 00:04:43,787
it takes three buses,
almost 90 minutes each way.

62
00:04:43,893 --> 00:04:44,882
My God.

63
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:46,725
So I wouldn't give them too much
of a homework load.

64
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:49,597
You'll just be wasting a lot of time
following up on overdue work.

65
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:51,501
All right. Thank you.

66
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,912
- You're from Newport Beach?
- Yes.

67
00:04:57,952 --> 00:05:00,787
It's too bad you weren't here
even two years ago, you know.

68
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,195
We used to have one of the highest
scholastic records in the district,

69
00:05:04,297 --> 00:05:07,861
but since voluntary integration
was suggested,

70
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:14,278
we've lost over 75%
of our strongest students.

71
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:17,843
Well, actually, I chose Wilson
because of the integration program.

72
00:05:17,956 --> 00:05:21,052
I think what's happening here
is really exciting, don't you?

73
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:23,632
My father was involved
in the civil rights movement.

74
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:27,172
And I remember when I was watching
the LA riots on TV,

75
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:29,037
I was thinking of going
to law school at the time.

76
00:05:29,142 --> 00:05:30,873
And I thought, "God, by the time

77
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,416
"you're defending a kid in a courtroom,
the battle's already lost."

78
00:05:33,517 --> 00:05:37,149
I think the real fighting
should happen here in the classroom.

79
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,330
Well, that's a very

80
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:45,305
well-thought-out phrase.

81
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:48,937
Erin,

82
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:53,881
I think you're a lovely, intelligent woman.

83
00:05:54,823 --> 00:05:56,986
But you're a first-time teacher.

84
00:05:57,094 --> 00:05:59,291
As head of this department,
I have to be confident

85
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,869
you're capable of dealing
with what we have to face here.

86
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,165
I am.

87
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,008
I know I have a lot to learn as a teacher,
but I'm a really good student.

88
00:06:07,113 --> 00:06:11,280
I am, and I really want to be here.

89
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:20,661
- Those are lovely pearls.
- Thank you. From my father.

90
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:23,837
I wouldn't wear them to class.

91
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,737
Honey?

92
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:45,107
What?

93
00:06:46,787 --> 00:06:48,483
Do I look like a teacher?

94
00:07:05,822 --> 00:07:06,881
Hey!

95
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,712
Hey, Chris, yo, what up?

96
00:08:49,948 --> 00:08:51,975
- Hello.
- Hello.

97
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:55,087
Hey, yo, let's sit right here, man.

98
00:09:01,436 --> 00:09:02,461
Hi.

99
00:09:32,527 --> 00:09:35,465
Hey, girl, you wanna give me
some fries with that shake?

100
00:09:43,346 --> 00:09:47,252
My name is Erin Gruwell.
Welcome to Freshman English.

101
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:49,752
I give this bitch a week.

102
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:50,884
Hi.

103
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:56,234
Okay. Brandy Ross?

104
00:09:56,338 --> 00:09:58,068
Gloria Munez.

105
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:02,541
Alejandro Santiago.

106
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,518
Andre Bryant.

107
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,222
Eva Benitez.

108
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,997
Eva, not Eva.

109
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,637
Eva.

110
00:10:19,514 --> 00:10:20,949
I have to go to the bathroom.

111
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,282
- Okay, make sure that you take a...
- Yeah, I know.

112
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:28,559
Ben Samuels?

113
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:31,667
That white boy hoping
he's in the wrong room.

114
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,033
I gotta get out of here.

115
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:36,202
- Sindy Ngor.
- Right here.

116
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:37,608
Is that correct?

117
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:40,814
- Jamal Hill?
- Man, what am I doing in here?

118
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:43,052
This whole ghetto-ass class
has got people in here

119
00:10:43,158 --> 00:10:45,127
looking like a bad rerun of Cops
and shit.

120
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:47,094
You know what I'm saying? It's true.

121
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:49,761
- Are you Jamal?
- Yeah.

122
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,637
Well, for some reason
they have you registered in this class.

123
00:10:52,742 --> 00:10:55,770
- Yeah, and that's some bullshit.
- It's the dumb class, coz.

124
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:58,008
It means you're too dumb.

125
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,257
- Man, say it to my face, coz.
- I just did.

126
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,056
See what I mean? Dumb.

127
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,496
- Man, I know you ain't talking to me!
- Okay...

128
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,159
Look, homey,
I'll beat that ass, homeboy.

129
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:08,328
Can you please sit back down?

130
00:11:08,438 --> 00:11:09,406
Look, I got your spot on the team.

131
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,838
That's why you're over there
wagging your tongue.

132
00:11:10,976 --> 00:11:12,205
Please sit back in your seats.

133
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:14,942
Look, your spot is good as gone. I don't
know why you keep wasting your time

134
00:11:15,084 --> 00:11:17,884
coming to practice with them
two-year-old Nikes on your feet!

135
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:19,982
You don't know nothing about me, coz!

136
00:11:21,161 --> 00:11:22,288
Broke down my whole situation.

137
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:23,456
Jamal?

138
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:24,534
So, now you're in my face now, right?

139
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,461
Sit your punk ass down!
Sit your punk ass down, homeboy!

140
00:11:26,572 --> 00:11:27,561
I will run that ass off the field.

141
00:11:27,674 --> 00:11:29,199
Shut your ass up. What's up, homey?

142
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,869
I mean, what's up?
Sit your ass down, homey!

143
00:11:31,046 --> 00:11:32,948
Excuse me,
may I please get some help in here?

144
00:11:35,488 --> 00:11:37,185
So do something! Back up!

145
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:38,282
You touching me now?

146
00:11:38,394 --> 00:11:40,830
Sit down, homeboy. Back up,
I'm not gonna tell you again.

147
00:11:40,931 --> 00:11:42,126
You gonna look at my face now, right?

148
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:43,530
You ain't taking nothing
from me, homeboy!

149
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,532
I will run your ass off the field!

150
00:11:45,674 --> 00:11:46,767
Boy, sit your ass back down.

151
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:48,571
Don't even worry about it,
I'm gonna see you.

152
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:49,976
Tell him. Sit his ass down.

153
00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:51,175
Sit your ass down.

154
00:11:51,284 --> 00:11:53,253
Thank you. Let him out of here, man.
That's some bullshit.

155
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:00,992
Erin?

156
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:08,816
Erin, this is Brian Gelford.

157
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:11,717
He teaches Junior English
and the Distinguished Honors Classes.

158
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:14,623
- Hi. Erin Gruwell. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

159
00:12:14,728 --> 00:12:19,499
- You saw a little action today, I hear.
- Yeah. It happened so fast.

160
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:21,529
Well, don't be discouraged.

161
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,839
You put your time in, in a few years,
you'll be able to teach juniors.

162
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:26,142
They're a pleasure.

163
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:28,913
By then, most of your kids
will be gone anyway.

164
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,757
- What do you mean?
- Well, eventually, they just stop coming.

165
00:12:35,566 --> 00:12:39,733
Well, if I do my job,
they might be lining up at the door.

166
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,640
- Right?
- Yeah.

167
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:47,451
- Nice pearls.
- Thank you.

168
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,881
If it was up to me,
I wouldn't even be in school.

169
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,885
My probation officer threatened me,

170
00:13:04,987 --> 00:13:07,514
telling me it was either school
or boot camp.

171
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:08,986
Dumbass.

172
00:13:09,094 --> 00:13:10,996
He thinks that the problems
going on in Long Beach

173
00:13:11,098 --> 00:13:13,227
aren't going to touch me at Wilson.

174
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:17,233
My PO doesn't understand
that schools are like the city,

175
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:19,404
and the city is just like a prison,

176
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:23,818
all of them divided into
separate sections, depending on tribes.

177
00:13:24,223 --> 00:13:25,988
There's Little Cambodia.

178
00:13:26,995 --> 00:13:28,429
The Ghetto.

179
00:13:28,698 --> 00:13:30,326
Wonder Bread Land.

180
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:34,799
And us,
South of the Border or Little Tijuana.

181
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:37,945
That's just the way it is,
and everyone knows it.

182
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:42,144
But soon enough, you have little
wannabes trying to hit you up at school,

183
00:13:42,257 --> 00:13:44,557
demanding respect they haven't earned.

184
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:49,397
It looks like this, one tribe drifting
quietly to another's territory

185
00:13:49,503 --> 00:13:53,135
without respect,
as if to claim what isn't theirs.

186
00:13:53,978 --> 00:13:58,384
An outsider looking in
would never see it, but we could feel it.

187
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,523
Something was coming.

188
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,486
Settle down.

189
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:24,466
Let's go over the first name
on the list, Homer.

190
00:14:24,768 --> 00:14:27,466
Homer's The Odyssey.

191
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:29,270
I know Homer the Simpson.

192
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,243
No, this Homer was an ancient Greek,

193
00:14:33,384 --> 00:14:36,652
but maybe he was bald
just like Homer Simpson.

194
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:42,126
Okay.

195
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,786
What's up?

196
00:15:02,138 --> 00:15:04,131
Quietly, please.

197
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:08,343
Mrs. Gruwell,
he just took my damn bag!

198
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,781
Shut up!
Ain't nobody touched your damn bag.

199
00:15:09,885 --> 00:15:10,875
Yeah, I saw you.

200
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,081
Jamal. Jamal. Get her backpack.

201
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:14,523
I didn't do nothing anyway!

202
00:15:14,628 --> 00:15:15,788
- Jamal. Jamal.
- Okay.

203
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,732
Wait! Wait! Please, stay in your seats!
Wait! Stay in your seats! Please!

204
00:15:52,197 --> 00:15:53,859
Slanty-eyed bitch!

205
00:15:58,776 --> 00:16:00,939
Return to your classrooms.

206
00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:04,845
Return to the classrooms immediately.

207
00:16:09,128 --> 00:16:10,721
That's all you got?

208
00:16:12,034 --> 00:16:15,871
Clear the school lawn
and the recreation field now!

209
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:23,813
...classrooms, or you will be subject
to disciplinary action.

210
00:16:25,158 --> 00:16:28,323
You can best help yourself
and your fellow students

211
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:32,063
and your school by returning
to your classrooms now.

212
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:34,605
Please return to your classrooms.

213
00:16:34,843 --> 00:16:36,471
Get up, bitch!

214
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,010
All students must return
to their classrooms immediately.

215
00:16:43,993 --> 00:16:45,052
Erin?

216
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,725
Erin.

217
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:51,402
Hey, baby.

218
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,708
You okay?

219
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,948
Come here.

220
00:16:59,054 --> 00:17:00,955
Are you sure about this?

221
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:04,358
Well, it's not exactly how I pictured it.

222
00:17:06,668 --> 00:17:08,399
Don't tell my dad.

223
00:17:09,106 --> 00:17:11,235
Hopefully, he hasn't seen the news.

224
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,379
- So, how's work?
- Dad.

225
00:17:17,989 --> 00:17:21,155
- I was asking your husband.
- It's good. I mean, for now.

226
00:17:21,296 --> 00:17:22,423
It's a good company.

227
00:17:22,564 --> 00:17:24,499
I pretty much run
the computer data department.

228
00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:27,903
- I thought you were an architect.
- He is. He's just taking a break.

229
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:29,704
And the money's good for now.

230
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:33,418
How much are you making,
$27,000 before taxes?

231
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:35,115
If you know, why are you asking?

232
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,053
So, what's everybody gonna eat?

233
00:17:37,158 --> 00:17:40,187
With your brains,
you could run a major corporation.

234
00:17:40,297 --> 00:17:42,995
Instead, I worry all night
because you're a teacher at Attica.

235
00:17:43,102 --> 00:17:45,072
Can you hear what you're saying?

236
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:48,737
How many times have I listened to you
about walking civil rights marches?

237
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:51,647
These gangs are criminals,
not activists. You read the papers?

238
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:53,617
They said the same thing
about the Black Panthers.

239
00:17:53,755 --> 00:17:55,691
I'll lay odds your kids don't even know

240
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:57,853
who Rap Brown
or Eldridge Cleaver were.

241
00:17:57,997 --> 00:17:59,660
You're gonna waste your talents
on people

242
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:02,237
who don't give a damn about education.

243
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,437
It breaks my heart.

244
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:07,940
I tell you the truth.

245
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:09,442
Well...

246
00:18:11,555 --> 00:18:14,492
I'm sorry. I can't help that.

247
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:22,071
- You think this is good enough for her?
- Yeah, I do.

248
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,578
Look, Steve,

249
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,152
if Erin thinks she can teach these kids,
she can.

250
00:18:28,753 --> 00:18:31,691
You telling her she can't
is just gonna make her mad.

251
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:41,669
So he doesn't like your job. So what?
Why do you let it get to you?

252
00:18:41,778 --> 00:18:44,883
I don't know, it just does.
I'm not used to disappointing him. I...

253
00:18:44,883 --> 00:18:46,112
Just let me know
when I can brush my teeth.

254
00:18:46,219 --> 00:18:48,280
- I hate that we don't have our own sinks.
- Come in. There's room.

255
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,619
All right. Thank you.

256
00:18:49,725 --> 00:18:52,856
I can't believe he brought up my salary.

257
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,732
What's happened to him?

258
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:57,102
He was like Atticus Finch to me
when I was growing up,

259
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,838
and now he's talking about salaries?
I think he's playing too much golf.

260
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:03,483
In fact, I think he needs an intervention.

261
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,988
Why isn't being a teacher
good enough for him?

262
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:07,820
Honey, just calm down.

263
00:19:07,926 --> 00:19:11,194
You know, except for marrying me,

264
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:13,861
you never seriously disappoint him.
He worships you.

265
00:19:13,971 --> 00:19:15,303
He likes you. He just doesn't...

266
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:17,603
He just doesn't think
I'm good enough for you, which is fine.

267
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:20,581
That's what fathers do.
I'm sure I'll be that way someday.

268
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:25,147
Look, just, you know, stop worrying
about being his perfect daughter.

269
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:27,821
You don't live in his house,
you live in ours.

270
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,558
Or until we find one.

271
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:32,731
- Or until you build us one.
- Yeah.

272
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:35,201
With extra sinks.

273
00:19:42,023 --> 00:19:44,493
You're a teacher
because you say you are.

274
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,923
I have this idea.

275
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:07,933
We're gonna be covering poetry.
Who here likes Tupac Shakur?

276
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:09,027
It's 2Pac.

277
00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:12,407
2Pac Shakur. Excuse me.
Raise your hand.

278
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:16,614
Really? I thought there'd be more fans.

279
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:19,356
I have the lyrics to this song printed out.

280
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:22,191
I want you to listen to this phrase
I have up on the board.

281
00:20:22,297 --> 00:20:24,894
It's an example of an internal rhyme.

282
00:20:25,003 --> 00:20:29,501
What he does is
very sophisticated and cool, actually.

283
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:32,548
"Man-child in the promised land
couldn't afford many heroes

284
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,018
"Moms was the only one there
Pops was a no-show

285
00:20:35,121 --> 00:20:38,423
"And, no, I guess you didn't know
that I would grow to be so strong

286
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,996
"You looking kinda pale, was it the ale?
Oh, pops was wrong

287
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:43,466
"Where was the money that you said
you would send me?

288
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,870
"Talked on the phone
and you sounded so friendly"

289
00:20:45,975 --> 00:20:48,946
- Think we don't know 2Pac?
- White girl gonna teach us about rap.

290
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,074
No, it's not that.
See, what I was trying to do...

291
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:54,054
You have no idea
what you're doing up there, do you?

292
00:20:54,991 --> 00:20:57,052
You ever been a teacher before?

293
00:20:57,797 --> 00:20:59,527
And teacher gets nailed, y'all!

294
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:03,037
All right, Jamal, enough.
Jamal! That's enough!

295
00:21:03,574 --> 00:21:06,841
You know what? I want you to move
to this front seat right here now.

296
00:21:06,947 --> 00:21:09,247
- What?
- Come on.

297
00:21:10,454 --> 00:21:13,323
I am sick of these antics
in my classroom.

298
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:16,331
Well, there you are.

299
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:19,095
I was wondering when
you were gonna lose that damn smile.

300
00:21:19,203 --> 00:21:20,501
Switch with Ben.

301
00:21:20,605 --> 00:21:23,132
- Come on.
- I can't go back there alone.

302
00:21:23,243 --> 00:21:25,236
- It'll be fine.
- No, it won't.

303
00:21:25,347 --> 00:21:26,440
I'm not sitting near him.

304
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:27,778
I ain't going up there without my homey.

305
00:21:27,885 --> 00:21:29,218
I'm not sitting back there alone!

306
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:30,620
- All right.
- Shut up.

307
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:31,817
All right, you know what?

308
00:21:31,926 --> 00:21:34,396
I want you all to move
to this side of the room.

309
00:21:34,498 --> 00:21:37,629
You in the back, up here.
Sindy and all of you, move to the back.

310
00:21:38,271 --> 00:21:40,902
Come on. Let's go. Now!

311
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:46,114
Get your ass back to China, all of y'all.

312
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:52,160
- You're all little midget-ass punks.
- Move before I stomp your peanuts.

313
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,237
Boo!

314
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,949
Get your ass to the back, boy.

315
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,358
Get off my desk.

316
00:22:36,312 --> 00:22:38,076
So, everybody happy
with the new borders?

317
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,328
Eva?

318
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:50,130
Where are you going?

319
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:51,604
Hey! Hey!

320
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,751
This is bull! Come on, man! What the...

321
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:13,069
What the hell? Damn!

322
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:16,466
I want my money back!

323
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,444
This shit took my damn money!
I want my damn money back!

324
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,051
Look what you putting me through. Shit!

325
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:27,958
Learn to speak the damn language!
You're from this country, aren't you?

326
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,862
I want my money back!

327
00:25:30,235 --> 00:25:30,702
I want my money back!

328
00:25:30,702 --> 00:25:32,193
I want my money back!

329
00:25:54,981 --> 00:25:56,449
Come on! Let's go!

330
00:26:00,156 --> 00:26:01,853
Come on, come on, girl! Let's go!

331
00:26:25,102 --> 00:26:26,731
Paco was scared.

332
00:26:26,973 --> 00:26:28,464
In the car, he said,

333
00:26:28,575 --> 00:26:31,547
'"You can't go against your own people,
your own blood."

334
00:26:31,648 --> 00:26:35,188
The same words
my father used so many times.

335
00:26:35,188 --> 00:26:36,816
Only I saw Paco.

336
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:38,718
The others were turned away.

337
00:26:38,828 --> 00:26:43,030
So when the police questioned me,
I knew I had to protect him.

338
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:50,449
All right, everyone, we need to get
started so classes won't be too delayed.

339
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,486
Principal Banning
would like to say something

340
00:26:52,587 --> 00:26:54,557
in the light of last night's events.

341
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:56,455
I've spoken to the police.

342
00:26:56,561 --> 00:26:59,192
As you might already know,
there were persons involved

343
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,704
in last night's shooting
who are Wilson students.

344
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:06,778
Grant Rice has been arrested
as a prime suspect.

345
00:27:06,813 --> 00:27:08,247
Ms. Gruwell,

346
00:27:08,349 --> 00:27:12,084
apparently one of your students,
Eva Benitez...

347
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,286
- Eva.
...has identified him as the shooter.

348
00:27:15,396 --> 00:27:17,798
She's the prime witness in the case.

349
00:27:17,934 --> 00:27:22,067
It is our policy not to discuss
the subject inside the classroom.

350
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,178
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

351
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,708
Hey, Tiny, check this out.

352
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:53,598
Hey. Hey!

353
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:10,690
Yes?

354
00:28:12,602 --> 00:28:13,968
All right.

355
00:28:15,641 --> 00:28:16,700
Gloria?

356
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,939
Please read the first sentence
on the board.

357
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:20,037
Why me?

358
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,016
Because I know
how much you love to read.

359
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,850
Close the magazine.

360
00:28:26,828 --> 00:28:29,527
"Odysseus had no sense of direction."

361
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,637
Now, none of these sentences
are correct.

362
00:28:31,771 --> 00:28:35,232
I'd like you to rewrite these sentences
using the proper tenses

363
00:28:35,378 --> 00:28:37,848
and spelling on page four
of your workbooks.

364
00:28:43,826 --> 00:28:46,933
I don't have a page four. It got torn out.

365
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:50,428
Okay, why don't you just use
the next blank page?

366
00:28:55,582 --> 00:28:57,210
What's going on?

367
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:02,389
What is that? Give it to me.

368
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:21,728
- What is this?
- Just leave it alone.

369
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,944
You think this is funny?

370
00:29:30,813 --> 00:29:31,940
Tito?

371
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:35,615
Would this be funny
if it were a picture of you?

372
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:37,288
It ain't.

373
00:29:47,344 --> 00:29:49,109
Close the workbooks.

374
00:29:56,594 --> 00:30:00,124
Maybe we should talk about art.
Tito's got real talent, don't you think?

375
00:30:00,234 --> 00:30:03,138
- Yeah, yeah.
- Go, Tito.

376
00:30:04,075 --> 00:30:05,669
You know something?

377
00:30:05,812 --> 00:30:09,546
I saw a picture just like this once
in a museum.

378
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,924
Only it wasn't a black man,
it was a Jewish man.

379
00:30:14,027 --> 00:30:16,793
And instead of the big lips,
he had a really big nose,

380
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,492
like a rat's nose.

381
00:30:18,602 --> 00:30:20,629
But he wasn't
just one particular Jewish man,

382
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,937
this was a drawing of all Jews.

383
00:30:23,344 --> 00:30:25,576
And these drawings
were put in the newspapers

384
00:30:25,682 --> 00:30:28,175
by the most famous gang in history.

385
00:30:29,522 --> 00:30:31,116
That's us, dawg.

386
00:30:33,797 --> 00:30:36,097
You think you know all about gangs?

387
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,063
You're amateurs.

388
00:30:39,574 --> 00:30:41,703
This gang would put you all to shame.

389
00:30:41,845 --> 00:30:46,114
And they started out poor and angry,
and everybody looked down on them.

390
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,157
Until one man decided
to give them some pride,

391
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:52,720
an identity and somebody to blame.

392
00:30:53,467 --> 00:30:55,436
You take over neighborhoods?

393
00:30:56,439 --> 00:31:00,743
That's nothing compared to them.
They took over countries.

394
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:02,247
And you wanna know how?

395
00:31:02,717 --> 00:31:05,210
They just wiped out everybody else.

396
00:31:05,389 --> 00:31:07,187
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

397
00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:09,695
Yeah, they wiped out
everybody they didn't like,

398
00:31:09,797 --> 00:31:12,927
and everybody they blamed
for their life being hard.

399
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:15,700
And one of the ways they did it
was by doing this.

400
00:31:15,842 --> 00:31:18,335
See, they'd print pictures like this
in the newspapers.

401
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,444
Jewish people with big, long noses.
Blacks with big, fat lips.

402
00:31:24,824 --> 00:31:27,193
They'd also publish scientific evidence

403
00:31:27,296 --> 00:31:31,531
that proved Jews and blacks
were the lowest form of human species.

404
00:31:32,472 --> 00:31:34,202
Jews and blacks
were more like animals.

405
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,641
And because they were just like animals

406
00:31:35,745 --> 00:31:37,942
it didn't really matter
whether they lived or died.

407
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:42,284
In fact, life would be a whole lot better
if they were all dead.

408
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,160
That's how a holocaust happens.

409
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:47,764
And that's what you all think
of each other.

410
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:48,892
You don't know nothing, homegirl.

411
00:31:49,036 --> 00:31:51,506
No, I don't, Marcus!
So why don't you explain it to me?

412
00:31:51,641 --> 00:31:53,611
I ain't explaining shit to you!

413
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,274
Do you even know how we live?

414
00:31:59,355 --> 00:32:00,914
We was here first, man.

415
00:32:01,526 --> 00:32:03,154
Just shut that shit up, homeboy.

416
00:32:03,564 --> 00:32:05,055
All right! All right! All right!

417
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:07,466
So what you're saying is,
if the Latinos weren't here,

418
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:10,600
or the Cambodians or the blacks
or the whites or whoever they are,

419
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,340
if they weren't here, everything
would be better for you, isn't that right?

420
00:32:13,448 --> 00:32:14,916
Of course it'd be better!

421
00:32:15,819 --> 00:32:17,948
It'd be better if you weren't here.

422
00:32:19,025 --> 00:32:20,687
Right. Right.

423
00:32:22,064 --> 00:32:24,466
It starts with a drawing like this,

424
00:32:25,103 --> 00:32:28,234
and then some kid dies in a drive-by,
never even knowing what hit him.

425
00:32:28,343 --> 00:32:30,244
You don't know nothing!

426
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,885
You don't know the pain we feel.

427
00:32:34,387 --> 00:32:36,083
You don't know what we got to do.

428
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,319
You got no respect for how we living.

429
00:32:38,427 --> 00:32:40,955
You got us in here,
teaching us this grammar shit,

430
00:32:41,066 --> 00:32:42,193
and then we got to go out there again.

431
00:32:42,302 --> 00:32:44,795
And what are you telling me
about that, huh?

432
00:32:44,906 --> 00:32:48,606
What are you doing in here that makes
a goddamn difference to my life?

433
00:32:48,713 --> 00:32:51,947
You don't feel respected.
Is that what you're saying, Eva?

434
00:32:52,253 --> 00:32:55,692
Well, maybe you're not.
But to get respect, you have to give it.

435
00:32:55,826 --> 00:32:57,386
That's bullshit.

436
00:32:58,565 --> 00:32:59,532
What?

437
00:32:59,633 --> 00:33:01,728
Why should I give my respect to you?

438
00:33:01,871 --> 00:33:03,465
'Cause you're a teacher?

439
00:33:03,574 --> 00:33:04,906
I don't know you.

440
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:07,413
How do I know
you're not a liar standing up there?

441
00:33:07,515 --> 00:33:10,612
How do I know you're not
a bad person standing up there?

442
00:33:11,221 --> 00:33:14,284
I'm not just gonna give you my respect
because you're called a teacher.

443
00:33:14,394 --> 00:33:18,494
White people always wanting their
respect like they deserve it for free.

444
00:33:19,538 --> 00:33:22,566
I'm a teacher.
It doesn't matter what color I am.

445
00:33:22,676 --> 00:33:24,509
It's all about color.

446
00:33:25,314 --> 00:33:27,614
It's about people deciding
what you deserve,

447
00:33:27,753 --> 00:33:30,018
about people wanting
what they don't deserve,

448
00:33:30,124 --> 00:33:32,458
about whites thinking
they run this world no matter what.

449
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:34,463
You see, I hate white people.

450
00:33:36,102 --> 00:33:37,502
- You hate me?
- Yeah.

451
00:33:37,604 --> 00:33:40,701
- You don't know me.
- I know what you can do.

452
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:44,613
I saw white cops shoot my friend
in the back for reaching into his pocket!

453
00:33:44,717 --> 00:33:45,946
His pocket.

454
00:33:46,454 --> 00:33:48,856
I saw white cops break into my house

455
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:52,591
and take my father for no reason
except because they feel like it!

456
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,794
Except because they can.

457
00:33:56,305 --> 00:33:59,505
And they can because they're white.

458
00:34:01,047 --> 00:34:03,483
So I hate white people on sight!

459
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:10,529
Ben, do you have anything to say?

460
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,397
Can I please get out of here?

461
00:34:12,502 --> 00:34:15,473
Lady, stop acting like you're trying
to understand our situation

462
00:34:15,574 --> 00:34:17,009
and just do your little babysitting
up there.

463
00:34:17,111 --> 00:34:19,411
- That's all you think this is?
- It ain't nothing else.

464
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,676
When I look out in the world,

465
00:34:20,784 --> 00:34:23,254
I don't see nobody that looks like me
with their pockets full,

466
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:25,848
unless they're rapping a lyric
or dribbling a ball.

467
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,292
So what else you got in here for me?

468
00:34:27,396 --> 00:34:29,833
And what if you can't rap a lyric
or dribble a ball?

469
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:33,533
- It ain't this. I know that much.
- Damn right.

470
00:34:33,675 --> 00:34:36,771
And you all think you're gonna make it
to graduation like this?

471
00:34:36,914 --> 00:34:38,678
I made it to high school.
Ain't nobody stopped me.

472
00:34:38,784 --> 00:34:41,756
Lady, I'm lucky if I make it to 18.
We in a war.

473
00:34:41,857 --> 00:34:43,485
We're graduating every day we live,

474
00:34:43,593 --> 00:34:45,893
because we ain't afraid to die
protecting our own.

475
00:34:45,997 --> 00:34:50,335
At least when you die for your own,
you die with respect, you die a warrior.

476
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:51,464
That's right.

477
00:34:51,574 --> 00:34:54,272
So when you're dead, you'll get respect?
Is that what you think?

478
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,438
- That's right.
- That's right.

479
00:34:55,549 --> 00:34:57,074
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

480
00:34:59,756 --> 00:35:02,226
You know what's gonna happen
when you die?

481
00:35:03,196 --> 00:35:05,359
You're gonna rot in the ground.

482
00:35:05,433 --> 00:35:09,806
And people are gonna go on living,
and they're gonna forget all about you.

483
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:13,147
And when you rot,

484
00:35:13,282 --> 00:35:18,246
do you think it's gonna matter
whether you were an original gangster?

485
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:20,993
You're dead.

486
00:35:22,398 --> 00:35:26,771
And nobody,
nobody is gonna wanna remember you,

487
00:35:26,873 --> 00:35:31,007
because all you left behind
in this world is this.

488
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,844
You're raising your hand?

489
00:35:52,922 --> 00:35:56,325
That thing that you said before,
the Holocause?

490
00:35:56,428 --> 00:35:58,990
- Holocaust, yes.
- What is that?

491
00:36:03,307 --> 00:36:06,541
Raise your hand if you know
what the Holocaust is.

492
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,103
Raise your hand

493
00:36:21,775 --> 00:36:25,407
if anyone in this classroom
has ever been shot at.

494
00:37:30,235 --> 00:37:33,035
What about this?
We were discussing the Holocaust.

495
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,608
No, they won't be able to read that.

496
00:37:35,745 --> 00:37:38,216
We can try.
The books are just sitting here.

497
00:37:38,317 --> 00:37:40,047
Look at their reading scores.

498
00:37:40,153 --> 00:37:42,419
And if I give your kids these books,
I'll never see them again.

499
00:37:42,524 --> 00:37:44,460
If I do, they'll be damaged.

500
00:37:44,828 --> 00:37:48,323
What about these? Romeo and Juliet.
That's a great gang story.

501
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:52,067
No, not the books.
This is what we give them.

502
00:37:52,577 --> 00:37:54,809
It is Romeo and Juliet,
but it's a condensed version.

503
00:37:54,948 --> 00:37:56,975
But even these,
look how they treat them.

504
00:37:57,118 --> 00:38:00,180
See how torn up they are?
They draw on them.

505
00:38:01,526 --> 00:38:03,257
Ms. Campbell?

506
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,523
They know they get these

507
00:38:04,565 --> 00:38:06,330
because no one thinks
they're smart enough for real books.

508
00:38:06,436 --> 00:38:08,405
Well, I don't have the budget
to buy new books every semester

509
00:38:08,505 --> 00:38:09,700
when these kids don't return them.

510
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:11,539
So, what do I do?
Buy their books myself?

511
00:38:11,645 --> 00:38:14,776
Well, that's up to you,
but you'd be wasting your money.

512
00:38:15,151 --> 00:38:18,021
Is there someone else
I can speak to about this?

513
00:38:18,558 --> 00:38:21,120
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry, but

514
00:38:22,131 --> 00:38:23,190
I don't understand.

515
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,099
Does the Long Beach Board of Ed agree

516
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:27,799
that these books should just sit here
and not be used at all?

517
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:29,535
Let me explain.

518
00:38:30,613 --> 00:38:33,380
It's called site-based instruction.

519
00:38:33,486 --> 00:38:36,355
It means that I and the principal
each have the authority

520
00:38:36,457 --> 00:38:39,327
to make these kinds of decisions
without having to go to the Board,

521
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:43,894
who have bigger problems to solve.
Do you understand how it works now?

522
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:47,009
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to overstep your authority.

523
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,273
I would never do that. I just...

524
00:38:50,885 --> 00:38:53,515
I don't know how to make them
interested in reading with these.

525
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:57,187
You can't make someone
want an education.

526
00:38:57,463 --> 00:39:01,528
The best you can do is try to get them
to obey, to learn discipline.

527
00:39:01,671 --> 00:39:04,403
That would be a tremendous
accomplishment for them.

528
00:39:08,283 --> 00:39:10,880
Since you know Margaret
better than I do,

529
00:39:10,988 --> 00:39:13,550
if I could just get
some backup from you.

530
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:18,533
I really think that the stories like
The Diary of Anne Frank and...

531
00:39:18,635 --> 00:39:20,366
That they'd be so great for them,

532
00:39:20,473 --> 00:39:23,934
and she doesn't seem to understand
that they could relate to these stories

533
00:39:24,046 --> 00:39:25,674
considering all that they face.

534
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:28,686
Oh, of course. It's a universal story.

535
00:39:28,788 --> 00:39:33,752
I mean, Anne Frank, Rodney King,
they're almost interchangeable.

536
00:39:37,537 --> 00:39:39,598
- Are you making fun of me?
- Yeah.

537
00:39:39,741 --> 00:39:41,904
God, listen to what you're saying.

538
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:44,346
How dare you compare them
to Anne Frank?

539
00:39:44,851 --> 00:39:45,978
They don't hide.

540
00:39:46,087 --> 00:39:48,580
They drive around in the open
with automatic weapons.

541
00:39:48,691 --> 00:39:52,152
I'm the one living in fear.
I can't walk out my door at night.

542
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,667
And you blame these kids?

543
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:57,866
This was an A-list school
before they came here.

544
00:39:57,975 --> 00:39:59,877
And look what they turned it into.

545
00:40:00,814 --> 00:40:03,182
I mean, does it make sense

546
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:06,248
that kids who want
an education should suffer

547
00:40:06,324 --> 00:40:09,296
because their high school gets turned
into a reform school?

548
00:40:09,397 --> 00:40:11,890
Because kids who don't want to be here,
and shouldn't be here,

549
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,298
are forced to be here

550
00:40:13,404 --> 00:40:15,374
by the geniuses
running the school district?

551
00:40:17,077 --> 00:40:18,842
Integration's a lie.

552
00:40:18,948 --> 00:40:22,648
Yeah, we teachers, we can't say that
or we lose our jobs for being racist.

553
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,851
So, please, stop your cheerleading,
Erin. You're ridiculous.

554
00:40:25,961 --> 00:40:28,523
You don't know the first thing
about these kids.

555
00:40:28,632 --> 00:40:30,659
And you're not qualified
to make judgments about the teachers

556
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:32,864
who have to survive this place.

557
00:41:13,114 --> 00:41:16,848
We're gonna play a game, all right?
It's a lot of fun. I promise.

558
00:41:18,491 --> 00:41:20,927
Look, you can either sit in your seats
reading those workbooks,

559
00:41:21,029 --> 00:41:22,019
or you can play a game.

560
00:41:22,165 --> 00:41:23,758
Either way,
you're in here till the bell rings.

561
00:41:23,867 --> 00:41:27,773
Okay. This is called the Line Game.

562
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:29,434
I'm gonna ask you a question.

563
00:41:29,545 --> 00:41:32,745
If that question applies to you,
you step onto the line,

564
00:41:32,851 --> 00:41:35,481
and then step back away
for the next question.

565
00:41:35,589 --> 00:41:37,286
- Easy, right?
- Yeah, whatever.

566
00:41:37,727 --> 00:41:39,059
The first question,

567
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:42,564
how many of you have
the new Snoop Dogg album?

568
00:41:50,617 --> 00:41:51,710
Did you steal it?

569
00:41:52,521 --> 00:41:53,989
Okay, back away.

570
00:41:57,196 --> 00:41:58,289
Next question,

571
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:01,894
how many of you have seen
Boyz n the Hood?

572
00:42:10,587 --> 00:42:12,557
Okay. Next question.

573
00:42:12,658 --> 00:42:15,562
How many of you live in the projects?

574
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:25,337
How many of you know someone,
a friend or relative,

575
00:42:25,482 --> 00:42:28,454
who was or is in juvenile hall or jail?

576
00:42:32,395 --> 00:42:34,558
How many of you have been
in juvenile hall

577
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:36,932
or jail for any length of time?

578
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:38,338
Detention don't count.

579
00:42:42,213 --> 00:42:43,910
Does a refugee camp count?

580
00:42:45,052 --> 00:42:46,418
You decide.

581
00:43:01,482 --> 00:43:04,214
How many of you know
where to get drugs right now?

582
00:43:09,497 --> 00:43:12,366
How many of you
know someone in a gang?

583
00:43:20,684 --> 00:43:23,382
How many of you are gang members?

584
00:43:24,591 --> 00:43:26,288
- Nice try.
- Nice try.

585
00:43:27,664 --> 00:43:30,465
Okay, that was a stupid question,
wasn't it?

586
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:31,537
Yeah.

587
00:43:31,672 --> 00:43:33,641
You're not allowed
gang affiliations in school.

588
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:36,143
I apologize for asking. My badness.

589
00:43:40,921 --> 00:43:44,691
Okay, now I'm gonna ask you
a more serious question.

590
00:43:45,597 --> 00:43:50,403
Stand on the line if you've lost
a friend to gang violence.

591
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:18,891
Stay on the line if you've lost
more than one friend.

592
00:44:25,738 --> 00:44:26,933
Three.

593
00:44:40,766 --> 00:44:42,564
Four or more.

594
00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:55,418
Okay, I'd like us to pay respect
to those people now.

595
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,053
Wherever you are,
just speak their name.

596
00:45:07,115 --> 00:45:08,083
James.

597
00:45:12,892 --> 00:45:13,860
Beatriz.

598
00:45:24,947 --> 00:45:26,746
Thank you all very much.

599
00:45:28,087 --> 00:45:30,717
Now, I have something for each of you.

600
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:35,694
Everyone has their own story,

601
00:45:35,802 --> 00:45:40,333
and it's important for you
to tell your own story, even to yourself.

602
00:45:40,477 --> 00:45:43,039
So, what we're going to do is

603
00:45:43,182 --> 00:45:46,153
we're gonna write every day
in these journals.

604
00:45:46,488 --> 00:45:51,054
You can write about whatever you want,
the past, the present, the future.

605
00:45:51,163 --> 00:45:55,068
You can write it like a diary,
or you can write

606
00:45:55,170 --> 00:46:00,579
songs, poems, any good thing,
bad thing, anything.

607
00:46:00,681 --> 00:46:03,379
But you have to write every day.

608
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:07,047
Keep a pen nearby.
Whenever you feel the inspiration.

609
00:46:07,092 --> 00:46:09,153
And they won't be graded.

610
00:46:09,263 --> 00:46:12,929
How can I give an A or a B
for writing the truth, right?

611
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:15,803
And I will not read them
unless you give me permission.

612
00:46:15,942 --> 00:46:19,676
I will need to see that you've made
an entry, but I'll just do this,

613
00:46:19,782 --> 00:46:21,307
skim to see that you wrote that day.

614
00:46:21,453 --> 00:46:26,724
Now, if you want me to read it, I have...
Excuse me. A cabinet over here.

615
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:30,495
It has a lock on it.
I will keep it open during class,

616
00:46:30,602 --> 00:46:33,438
and you can leave your diary there
if you want me to read it.

617
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:37,174
I will lock this cabinet
at the end of every class.

618
00:46:38,417 --> 00:46:39,510
Okay?

619
00:46:41,523 --> 00:46:47,398
So, you can each come up,
one by one, and take your own journal.

620
00:46:54,847 --> 00:46:56,714
Whenever you're ready.

621
00:47:21,397 --> 00:47:23,867
Eva holds back,
but I know she wants to be involved.

622
00:47:23,968 --> 00:47:25,436
She's so stubborn.

623
00:47:25,571 --> 00:47:27,905
Who really surprised me was Brandy,
who never says a word,

624
00:47:28,009 --> 00:47:30,742
but she was the first to step up
and take a journal. I...

625
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,680
Honey, here. Here, sit down.

626
00:47:32,785 --> 00:47:34,310
- It's all right. No, it's all right.
- I'll move this.

627
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:36,653
I don't mind standing.
Food goes straight down.

628
00:47:36,759 --> 00:47:39,696
- How much longer are you gonna be?
- I don't know.

629
00:47:39,798 --> 00:47:42,268
- Want to help?
- Not really, I'm a terrible drawer.

630
00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:46,240
- You're an architect.
- All right, I just don't want to.

631
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:49,205
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

632
00:47:49,316 --> 00:47:50,944
No, it's nothing.

633
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,550
Well, it's just, you know,
I want to hear all this, I do.

634
00:47:56,061 --> 00:47:57,120
It just...

635
00:47:57,263 --> 00:47:58,994
I feel like
we haven't talked about anything,

636
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,163
other than your job, in like forever.

637
00:48:02,306 --> 00:48:03,535
I'm sorry.

638
00:48:04,377 --> 00:48:06,073
- Well, what's going on at work?
- Nothing.

639
00:48:06,113 --> 00:48:07,741
I don't want to talk about that, either.

640
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:10,650
I just want to hang out.
I want to be home.

641
00:48:13,093 --> 00:48:15,586
And I want to be with my schoolteacher.

642
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:25,375
I've always had this fantasy
about being kept late after school.

643
00:48:25,483 --> 00:48:30,151
Well, I'm sorry I left
my dirty erasers at work.

644
00:48:30,291 --> 00:48:32,659
Do all the other teachers
put in this much extra effort?

645
00:48:32,763 --> 00:48:35,563
I don't know.
I'm kind of making it up as I go along.

646
00:48:35,667 --> 00:48:38,332
And the other teachers don't really
talk to me. I mean, Brian and Margaret...

647
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,375
- Honey, I don't want to think.
- I'm sorry. Okay, don't think.

648
00:48:40,476 --> 00:48:42,605
- I just wanna...
- I'm almost done, okay?

649
00:48:44,584 --> 00:48:46,382
So, how much longer?

650
00:48:47,657 --> 00:48:49,956
Not long. Promise.

651
00:48:54,035 --> 00:48:57,166
Thank you so much for coming.
Susan's a terrific student. Thank you.

652
00:48:57,275 --> 00:48:58,903
- Great to see you.
- Good night. Take care.

653
00:48:59,011 --> 00:49:00,947
- Jim, thank you so much.
- Thanks, Brian.

654
00:49:01,081 --> 00:49:03,176
I appreciate you guys coming
to Parents' Night.

655
00:49:03,386 --> 00:49:04,752
Drive safe.

656
00:49:45,664 --> 00:49:48,157
In every war, there is an enemy.

657
00:49:55,315 --> 00:49:58,287
I watched my mother
being half beaten to death

658
00:49:58,655 --> 00:50:01,855
and watched as blood and tears
streamed down her face.

659
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:04,867
I felt useless and scared
and furious at the same time.

660
00:50:04,867 --> 00:50:06,836
I felt useless and scared
and furious at the same time.

661
00:50:07,805 --> 00:50:09,535
Stay there, Brandy. Watch the kids!

662
00:50:09,676 --> 00:50:11,042
- Get my money!
- Watch the kids!

663
00:50:12,514 --> 00:50:16,248
I can still feel the sting of the belt
on my back and my legs.

664
00:50:16,855 --> 00:50:19,587
One time, he couldn't pay the rent.

665
00:50:19,694 --> 00:50:23,133
And that night he stopped us on
the street and pointed to the concrete.

666
00:50:23,233 --> 00:50:25,362
He said, "Pick a spot."

667
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:40,825
Clive was my boy.
He had my back plenty of times.

668
00:50:40,966 --> 00:50:44,667
We was like one fist, me and him,
one army.

669
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:47,274
- That's heavy.
- Y eah.

670
00:50:49,015 --> 00:50:52,978
That's the real shit right here.
Nobody'll jump us now.

671
00:50:53,423 --> 00:50:56,155
But we got to practice
'cause this, this got power.

672
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,992
You shoot it, it...

673
00:51:04,343 --> 00:51:06,711
I sat there till the police came.

674
00:51:07,883 --> 00:51:12,757
But when they come, all they see
is a dead body, a gun and a nigga.

675
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:17,199
They took me to juvenile hall.
First night was the scariest.

676
00:51:19,906 --> 00:51:21,704
Inmates banging on the walls,

677
00:51:21,809 --> 00:51:25,943
throwing up their gang signs, yelling out
who they were, where they're from.

678
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:30,381
I cried my first night.
Can't never let nobody know that.

679
00:51:31,293 --> 00:51:33,821
I spent the next few years
in and out of cells.

680
00:51:33,932 --> 00:51:36,732
Every day I'd worry,
"When will I be free?"

681
00:51:40,343 --> 00:51:43,213
My brother taught me
what the life is for a young black man.

682
00:51:43,316 --> 00:51:46,755
Do what you have to,
pimp, deal, whatever.

683
00:51:46,889 --> 00:51:49,291
Learn what colors to learn,
gang boundaries.

684
00:51:49,393 --> 00:51:51,590
You can stay on one corner,
you can't stay on another.

685
00:51:51,731 --> 00:51:54,429
Learn to be quiet.
A wrong word can get you popped.

686
00:51:54,536 --> 00:51:57,633
If you look in my eyes,
you'll see a loving girl.

687
00:51:57,742 --> 00:52:00,611
If you look at my smile,
you'll see nothing wrong.

688
00:52:01,249 --> 00:52:04,483
If you pull up my shirt,
you'll see the bruises.

689
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:06,784
What did I do to make him so mad?

690
00:52:06,826 --> 00:52:10,731
At 16, I've seen more dead bodies
than a mortician.

691
00:52:11,401 --> 00:52:15,101
Every time I step out my door,
I'm faced with the risk of being shot.

692
00:52:15,775 --> 00:52:19,909
To the outside world, it's just another
dead body on the street corner.

693
00:52:20,484 --> 00:52:22,454
They don 't know that he was my friend.

694
00:52:22,555 --> 00:52:23,887
During the war in Cambodia,

695
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:25,983
the camp stripped away
my father's dignity.

696
00:52:26,128 --> 00:52:28,598
He sometimes tries
to hurt my mom and me.

697
00:52:28,732 --> 00:52:30,895
I feel like I have to protect my family.

698
00:52:31,003 --> 00:52:36,002
I was having trouble deciding what
candy I wanted, then I heard gunshots.

699
00:52:36,113 --> 00:52:37,945
I looked down to see
that one of my friends

700
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:41,079
had blood coming out of
his back and his mouth.

701
00:52:41,824 --> 00:52:44,989
The next day, I pulled up my shirt
and got strapped with a gun

702
00:52:45,096 --> 00:52:47,362
I found in an alley by my house.

703
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:49,767
I don't even know how this war started.

704
00:52:49,872 --> 00:52:52,901
It's just two sides
who tripped each other way back.

705
00:52:53,011 --> 00:52:55,504
Who cares about the history behind it?

706
00:52:56,317 --> 00:52:57,751
I am my father's daughter.

707
00:52:57,853 --> 00:53:02,226
And when they call me to testify,
I will protect my own no matter what.

708
00:53:02,528 --> 00:53:06,092
Nobody cares what I do.
Why should I bother coming to school?

709
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:10,202
My friends are soldiers, not of war,
but of the streets.

710
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:12,143
They fight for their lives.

711
00:53:12,247 --> 00:53:14,683
I hate the cold feeling of a gun
against my skin.

712
00:53:14,785 --> 00:53:16,083
It makes me shiver.

713
00:53:16,187 --> 00:53:19,921
It's a crazy-ass life.
Once you're in, there's no getting out.

714
00:53:20,028 --> 00:53:21,622
Every time I jump somebody in

715
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:24,930
and make someone a part of our gang,
it's another baptism.

716
00:53:25,038 --> 00:53:27,474
They give us their life,
we give them a new one.

717
00:53:27,609 --> 00:53:30,911
I've lost many friends
who have died in an undeclared war.

718
00:53:32,184 --> 00:53:34,654
T o the soldiers and me, it's all worth it.

719
00:53:35,189 --> 00:53:38,855
Risk your life dodging bullets,
pulling triggers.

720
00:53:40,266 --> 00:53:41,894
It's all worth it.

721
00:53:59,234 --> 00:54:00,224
Rum and Coke.

722
00:54:00,336 --> 00:54:01,599
Oh, man.

723
00:54:02,874 --> 00:54:03,967
This is...

724
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:07,480
Mr. Gruwell? Your table is ready.
Follow me.

725
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:09,810
- Dad, I got them.
- Okay.

726
00:54:11,423 --> 00:54:13,859
Dad, I don't know what to do with this.

727
00:54:13,961 --> 00:54:16,397
I'm not a social worker.
I'm barely a teacher.

728
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,467
Thank you.

729
00:54:17,567 --> 00:54:20,767
These kids, they're 14, 15 years old,

730
00:54:20,874 --> 00:54:23,573
and if they make it through the day
alive, that's good enough.

731
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:25,648
And I'm supposed to teach them?

732
00:54:28,555 --> 00:54:30,046
Listen to me.

733
00:54:30,158 --> 00:54:34,155
You're not responsible
for their lives outside that classroom.

734
00:54:35,435 --> 00:54:38,406
- Just do your job the best you can.
- How?

735
00:54:38,506 --> 00:54:40,772
The administration
doesn't give me any resources,

736
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:42,710
no books, no support.

737
00:54:44,517 --> 00:54:46,146
So, what should I do?

738
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:52,090
Fulfill your obligation
till the end of the school year,

739
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:54,567
but line up another position.

740
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:58,374
Success follows experience.

741
00:54:58,477 --> 00:55:00,777
So, get some more experience.

742
00:55:02,618 --> 00:55:06,751
But no matter what,
you gotta remember, it's just a job.

743
00:55:07,594 --> 00:55:11,534
If you're not right for this one,
get another job.

744
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:15,865
You're gonna sell bras
at a department store?

745
00:55:16,009 --> 00:55:17,204
Just part-time.

746
00:55:17,311 --> 00:55:19,839
I'm having a little trouble
getting books and things for the kids.

747
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:22,079
So, a little extra money
will give me a little more freedom

748
00:55:22,188 --> 00:55:23,417
to do what I want.

749
00:55:23,524 --> 00:55:25,926
And this way you can play tennis
with Evan after work.

750
00:55:26,028 --> 00:55:28,055
Okay, let me get my head around this.

751
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:31,400
You're going to get an extra job
to pay for your job.

752
00:55:31,805 --> 00:55:34,241
It's just temporary. I promise.

753
00:55:34,343 --> 00:55:36,836
Once the kids' grades go up,
I'll get a little more help from the school.

754
00:55:36,948 --> 00:55:40,148
And I get an employee's discount.
Isn't that great?

755
00:55:40,288 --> 00:55:43,385
- Want a new TV?
- Yeah.

756
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:59,846
Excuse me, if I wanted to order
any books in bulk,

757
00:55:59,958 --> 00:56:02,121
could I get some sort of a discount?

758
00:56:06,336 --> 00:56:08,363
- These books are brand new.
- I know.

759
00:56:09,675 --> 00:56:12,442
Okay, guys, gals. Listen up.

760
00:56:12,848 --> 00:56:14,943
The only problem with this book is

761
00:56:15,086 --> 00:56:16,782
it's about a gang member
and there's violence in it,

762
00:56:16,922 --> 00:56:19,085
so you may not be able to read it
as part of the curriculum.

763
00:56:19,226 --> 00:56:23,030
So, I'm going to try my best
to get permission, all right?

764
00:56:25,472 --> 00:56:27,635
It's been a little difficult
getting their attention.

765
00:56:27,743 --> 00:56:31,477
Up until recently, the only thing they
hated more than each other was me.

766
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:35,018
Well, you united them and that's a step.

767
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:38,219
What can I do for you?

768
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:43,836
I want to do more with them, and I need
the support of someone in power.

769
00:56:43,938 --> 00:56:46,774
You have to take this up with your
department head and your principal.

770
00:56:46,911 --> 00:56:48,881
I can't get involved
in inner school policy.

771
00:56:49,253 --> 00:56:51,450
My principal only listens
to my department head,

772
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:53,561
and she's not very supportive.

773
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:55,391
You'll have to find a way to deal with it.

774
00:56:55,497 --> 00:56:58,298
No, I'd rather just deal directly
with someone in power.

775
00:56:58,403 --> 00:57:00,532
Ms. Gruwell, there's a system in place

776
00:57:00,641 --> 00:57:03,476
based on years of running
an educational facility.

777
00:57:03,646 --> 00:57:06,743
- You have to follow that system.
- No. I won't.

778
00:57:07,787 --> 00:57:10,724
Look, I'm just trying to do my job here.

779
00:57:10,826 --> 00:57:13,730
What's the point
of a voluntary integration program

780
00:57:13,832 --> 00:57:16,632
if the kids making it to high school
have a 5th grade reading level?

781
00:57:16,738 --> 00:57:18,536
I enforced that program.

782
00:57:18,641 --> 00:57:19,734
With all due respect,

783
00:57:19,843 --> 00:57:22,211
all that program is doing
is warehousing these kids

784
00:57:22,347 --> 00:57:23,748
until they're old enough to disappear.

785
00:57:23,852 --> 00:57:25,480
Look, I appreciate your intentions,

786
00:57:25,621 --> 00:57:28,183
but there's nothing I can do
on a class-by-class basis.

787
00:57:28,326 --> 00:57:31,856
Dr. Cohn, why should they waste
their time showing up

788
00:57:31,967 --> 00:57:34,665
when they know
we're wasting our time teaching them?

789
00:57:34,772 --> 00:57:37,504
We tell them, "Go to school.
Get an education."

790
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:41,710
And then we say, "Well, they can't learn,
so let's not waste resources."

791
00:57:42,085 --> 00:57:43,576
I'm thinking trips.

792
00:57:43,689 --> 00:57:46,558
Most of them have never
been outside of Long Beach.

793
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:49,130
They haven't been given the opportunity

794
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:51,758
to expand their thinking
about what's out there for them.

795
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:53,270
And they're hungry for it. I know it.

796
00:57:53,373 --> 00:57:55,502
And it's purely a reward system.

797
00:57:55,677 --> 00:57:57,441
They won't get anything
they haven't earned

798
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,675
by doing their work
and upping their grades.

799
00:57:59,819 --> 00:58:01,117
But if Ms. Campbell
won't give you books

800
00:58:01,222 --> 00:58:02,280
because of budget restrictions,

801
00:58:02,424 --> 00:58:03,551
she's not gonna approve school trips.

802
00:58:03,727 --> 00:58:05,127
I'll raise the money.

803
00:58:05,229 --> 00:58:07,859
I just need to know
I won't meet resistance.

804
00:58:08,268 --> 00:58:10,362
See, I can't promise them anything
I can't deliver.

805
00:58:10,472 --> 00:58:12,909
It only proves what they already believe.

806
00:58:14,847 --> 00:58:18,684
All I'm saying is, Ms. Campbell
doesn't need to be bothered.

807
00:58:22,193 --> 00:58:23,958
You're a concierge at the Marriott?

808
00:58:24,097 --> 00:58:25,224
It's just weekends.

809
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:27,269
You play tennis with Evan on Saturdays.

810
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:29,305
And you can play golf
with my dad on Sundays.

811
00:58:29,407 --> 00:58:30,431
You want me to play golf?

812
00:58:30,576 --> 00:58:32,842
And the bonus is I get employee rates

813
00:58:32,947 --> 00:58:35,213
on Marriott hotel rooms
all over the world.

814
00:58:35,319 --> 00:58:36,309
I've heard a lot of hyphenates,

815
00:58:36,455 --> 00:58:39,894
but a bra-selling-English-teacher-
hotel-concierge has gotta be a new one.

816
00:58:40,028 --> 00:58:42,521
You told me your part-time job
was temporary.

817
00:58:42,633 --> 00:58:45,001
It is. I just don't know for how long.

818
00:58:45,705 --> 00:58:47,640
- What if I said no?
- No, what?

819
00:58:47,742 --> 00:58:50,178
No, I don't want you working three jobs.

820
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,307
- But I can make it work, Scott.
- No, that's not the point.

821
00:58:52,417 --> 00:58:54,819
You can do anything!
We know that already.

822
00:58:54,922 --> 00:58:57,951
It's just that I... You...

823
00:58:58,629 --> 00:59:00,393
You didn't even ask me.

824
00:59:01,501 --> 00:59:04,905
- I'm just trying to do my job, Scott.
- By getting two more jobs?

825
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:07,404
I don't understand, Erin.

826
00:59:08,514 --> 00:59:11,076
Scott, this is our time
to go after what we want,

827
00:59:11,186 --> 00:59:14,488
when we're young,
before we have a family.

828
00:59:14,726 --> 00:59:16,923
Maybe this is the perfect time
for you to go back to school,

829
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,159
get your architect's degree.

830
00:59:19,268 --> 00:59:21,170
Wouldn't that be great?

831
00:59:24,244 --> 00:59:25,713
What?

832
00:59:27,383 --> 00:59:28,681
Nothing.

833
00:59:35,465 --> 00:59:37,367
So, I'll call you with a list of venues.

834
00:59:37,469 --> 00:59:39,564
I've scheduled a PTA board meeting
for next week.

835
00:59:39,706 --> 00:59:40,696
So, it should be no problem.

836
00:59:40,842 --> 00:59:41,935
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

837
00:59:42,077 --> 00:59:43,705
- Lovely to see you, Paula.
- Good to see you, too.

838
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:45,578
- Hi.
- Hello.

839
00:59:45,985 --> 00:59:49,116
Principal Banning received a call
from Dr. Cohn at the school board.

840
00:59:49,225 --> 00:59:51,457
Apparently you're taking your students
on a trip?

841
00:59:51,562 --> 00:59:55,023
Yes, but it's over the weekend,
so it won't affect any test schedules.

842
00:59:55,136 --> 00:59:56,832
I know how busy you are,

843
00:59:56,939 --> 01:00:00,378
and since I'm paying for it myself,
I didn't want to bother you.

844
01:00:22,687 --> 01:00:23,814
I'll be right back.

845
01:00:23,923 --> 01:00:26,588
Oh, no. No, no, no. Erin?

846
01:00:27,096 --> 01:00:30,000
- Get back in the car.
- Dad, he lives right here.

847
01:00:30,102 --> 01:00:33,130
I'll get him.
Get back in the car and lock your door.

848
01:00:35,277 --> 01:00:37,770
- What's his name?
- Andre Bryant.

849
01:00:37,882 --> 01:00:38,850
Andre.

850
01:00:42,792 --> 01:00:46,959
Since my pop split, my mom can't even
look at me, 'cause I look like my dad.

851
01:00:47,467 --> 01:00:49,265
And with my brother in jail,

852
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:52,342
she looks at me and thinks
that's where I'm going, too.

853
01:00:52,676 --> 01:00:54,304
She doesn't see me.

854
01:00:54,914 --> 01:00:56,941
She doesn't see me at all.

855
01:01:01,561 --> 01:01:03,052
I'm going out.

856
01:01:08,507 --> 01:01:09,531
- What up?
- Hey.

857
01:01:09,643 --> 01:01:11,544
Where you going? I need you.

858
01:01:12,014 --> 01:01:14,951
No, man, I can't now.
I got something to do.

859
01:01:15,086 --> 01:01:16,680
T onight. I'll do it tonight.

860
01:01:16,823 --> 01:01:19,919
I gotta go do something,
and I can't carry that around with me.

861
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:22,161
Forget it, man, I'll get somebody else.

862
01:01:22,265 --> 01:01:24,326
I can't be waiting all day on you.

863
01:01:24,971 --> 01:01:26,064
Hey.

864
01:01:27,542 --> 01:01:30,946
Sorry about your brother, man.
I hear he going away for life.

865
01:01:31,249 --> 01:01:33,685
They won't get it.
The guy he was with confessed.

866
01:01:33,788 --> 01:01:35,917
To who? Your brother?

867
01:01:36,627 --> 01:01:39,029
Hey. You Andre?

868
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:51,988
- What up?
- Hey.

869
01:01:57,866 --> 01:02:00,268
- What?
- Put on your seat belt.

870
01:02:03,644 --> 01:02:05,442
You, too, young lady.

871
01:02:08,921 --> 01:02:11,483
You kids ever been
to Newport Beach before?

872
01:02:11,693 --> 01:02:15,325
What? We went there last year
on our way to Paris.

873
01:02:21,611 --> 01:02:23,079
Paris.

874
01:02:27,488 --> 01:02:28,456
It's good.

875
01:02:28,791 --> 01:02:30,454
I brought you something.

876
01:02:34,568 --> 01:02:37,198
It's a good book. I read it in school.

877
01:02:37,306 --> 01:02:41,110
It's about a gang kid,
and I thought you might like to read it.

878
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:52,165
He told me what I had to say
when I'm on the stand.

879
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:52,104
At the beginning of the tour, they give
you a card with a child's picture on it.

880
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:55,446
You could find out who they were
and what camp they were sent to.

881
01:03:55,554 --> 01:03:59,358
And at the end of the tour,
you could find out if they survived.

882
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:02,496
I got a little girl from Italy.

883
01:04:16,827 --> 01:04:18,956
Tito, your hat.

884
01:04:48,955 --> 01:04:52,587
Kristallnacht, they called it.
The Night of Broken Glass.

885
01:04:52,695 --> 01:04:55,029
Hundreds of synagogues
looted and burned.

886
01:04:55,132 --> 01:04:57,899
More than 7, 000
Jewish stores destroyed.

887
01:04:58,005 --> 01:05:00,099
Over 100 Jews killed.

888
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:18,309
A small center for children in Isieux
in the French province of Ain.

889
01:05:19,012 --> 01:05:21,915
Among the children deported that day
to Birkenau

890
01:05:22,017 --> 01:05:25,387
was 11-year-old Liliane Berenstein,

891
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:29,395
who, before leaving,
left behind a letter to God.

892
01:05:35,241 --> 01:05:39,875
My little boy died.
He got off the train and they killed him.

893
01:05:40,384 --> 01:05:42,547
I don't know why
it bothered me so much.

894
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:44,819
I've seen death all my life.

895
01:05:45,094 --> 01:05:49,762
But this little boy was only five.

896
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:14,205
Ms. G had a beautiful dinner for us
at the hotel where she works.

897
01:06:14,915 --> 01:06:18,878
She invited real Holocaust survivors
from the museum to meet us.

898
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,858
There was Elisabeth Mann.

899
01:06:21,963 --> 01:06:26,505
I had my parents,
my sister, my two brothers.

900
01:06:26,505 --> 01:06:26,698
I had my parents,
my sister, my two brothers.

901
01:06:26,806 --> 01:06:28,274
Gloria Ungar.

902
01:06:28,375 --> 01:06:30,971
If any of you have seen someone
with a number on their arm,

903
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,073
these were the lucky people.

904
01:06:33,184 --> 01:06:35,620
The people who,
when we came to Auschwitz,

905
01:06:35,722 --> 01:06:39,525
when they tattooed the people
they took us to do the slave work.

906
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:43,262
Not the others,
and that included many of my family.

907
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:45,636
So, we ran away,
some of the young kids.

908
01:06:45,741 --> 01:06:48,177
I was at that time
11 -and-a-half years old.

909
01:06:48,279 --> 01:06:49,304
Eddie Ilam.

910
01:06:49,448 --> 01:06:51,418
And where to go, I didn't know,

911
01:06:51,518 --> 01:06:55,252
but I remember one place
where I used to live.

912
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,727
So when I ran there,
there was not one Jew left.

913
01:06:57,831 --> 01:07:01,031
I was in the worst camp.
I was in Auschwitz.

914
01:07:01,137 --> 01:07:02,605
And Renee Firestone.

915
01:07:02,706 --> 01:07:06,612
When I arrived, my parents were
immediately taken away from me.

916
01:07:07,048 --> 01:07:10,350
My little sister,
who was then 14 years old,

917
01:07:10,387 --> 01:07:13,119
stayed with me for a little while.

918
01:07:13,593 --> 01:07:16,793
And then later on,
I was separated from her also.

919
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:19,530
She lost her whole family at the camps.

920
01:07:20,372 --> 01:07:24,472
She came to this country with $4
in her pocket and a newborn baby.

921
01:07:25,549 --> 01:07:27,712
I'll never forget these people.

922
01:07:27,853 --> 01:07:30,653
And then she was killed
because they didn't want...

923
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:33,663
I can't believe Ms. G did all of this
for us.

924
01:07:41,212 --> 01:07:42,805
Hi, honey, it's me.

925
01:07:42,916 --> 01:07:45,512
Look, we're still at the restaurant,
if you wanted to drop by.

926
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,248
We haven't even ordered dessert yet,

927
01:07:47,356 --> 01:07:49,724
and the kids are having
such an incredible time.

928
01:07:49,828 --> 01:07:51,593
You have to see them.

929
01:07:51,698 --> 01:07:54,761
If you get in soon, come by.
It's only 9:30 now.

930
01:07:56,173 --> 01:08:00,614
Okay, I'll see you later. Love you. Bye.

931
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:34,109
How many times
I gotta tell your ass again?

932
01:08:34,211 --> 01:08:36,340
Get your butt in here!

933
01:09:08,676 --> 01:09:11,146
So, you had all summer
to read and consider this book.

934
01:09:15,288 --> 01:09:19,058
And you know,
I thought it would be most valuable

935
01:09:19,764 --> 01:09:25,173
to begin with Victoria
to give us the black perspective.

936
01:09:26,744 --> 01:09:28,042
Victoria?

937
01:09:28,848 --> 01:09:30,841
Do I have a stamp
on my forehead that says,

938
01:09:30,952 --> 01:09:33,514
"The National Spokesperson
for the Plight of Black People"?

939
01:09:33,757 --> 01:09:36,923
How the hell should I know the black
perspective on The Color Purple?

940
01:09:37,063 --> 01:09:40,502
That's it, if I don't change classes,
I'm gonna hurt this fool.

941
01:09:40,603 --> 01:09:42,664
Teachers treat me like
I'm some kind of Rosetta stone

942
01:09:42,807 --> 01:09:44,241
for African-Americans.

943
01:09:44,343 --> 01:09:46,108
What? Black people learn how to read,

944
01:09:46,213 --> 01:09:48,911
and we all miraculously come
to the same conclusion?

945
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:52,616
At that point, I decided to check out
my friend Brandy's English class.

946
01:09:52,726 --> 01:09:54,195
- Good to see you, man.
- Hey, yeah.

947
01:09:54,296 --> 01:09:56,357
- How was your summer?
- Great.

948
01:10:00,874 --> 01:10:02,844
You're still white, I see.

949
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,346
Okay, everybody. Ready?

950
01:10:05,516 --> 01:10:06,643
- Hey, Ms. G.
- Hi.

951
01:10:06,752 --> 01:10:08,085
- Hi, Ms. G.
- Hi.

952
01:10:17,539 --> 01:10:21,034
Okay, guys, gals, listen up!
This is what I want you to do.

953
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:25,378
I want each of you to step forward
and take one of these Borders bags,

954
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:28,391
which contain the four books
we're gonna read this semester.

955
01:10:28,494 --> 01:10:29,723
All right!

956
01:10:30,464 --> 01:10:32,764
They're very special books,

957
01:10:32,869 --> 01:10:37,333
and they each remind me,
in some way, of each of you.

958
01:10:41,251 --> 01:10:44,519
But, before you take the books,

959
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:48,962
I want you to take one of these glasses
of sparkling cider,

960
01:10:49,065 --> 01:10:52,868
and I want each of you to make a toast.

961
01:10:54,175 --> 01:10:57,670
We're each gonna make
a toast for change.

962
01:10:58,115 --> 01:11:02,681
And what that means is,
from this moment on

963
01:11:03,258 --> 01:11:08,598
every voice that told you
"You can't" is silenced.

964
01:11:09,737 --> 01:11:15,009
Every reason that tells you things
will never change, disappears.

965
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:19,690
And the person you were
before this moment,

966
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:23,493
that person's turn is over.
Now it's your turn.

967
01:11:24,432 --> 01:11:25,730
Okay?

968
01:11:26,836 --> 01:11:30,798
Okay, you ready to get
this party going on?

969
01:11:33,782 --> 01:11:35,410
- What?
- Stop doing that, man.

970
01:11:35,518 --> 01:11:37,078
What's the dealio?

971
01:11:45,338 --> 01:11:48,366
Man, I've had boyfriends since I was,
like, 11, you know.

972
01:11:49,078 --> 01:11:51,844
- I believe you.
- Shut up.

973
01:11:52,251 --> 01:11:55,381
Okay, well, I was always the person

974
01:11:55,523 --> 01:11:58,962
that was gonna get pregnant
before I turned 16 and drop out.

975
01:11:59,865 --> 01:12:01,231
Like my mom.

976
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:06,642
Ain't gonna happen.

977
01:12:06,878 --> 01:12:09,075
Nobody ever listens to a teenager.

978
01:12:09,817 --> 01:12:13,449
Everybody thinks you should be happy
just because you're young.

979
01:12:13,557 --> 01:12:16,585
They don't see the wars
that we fight every single day.

980
01:12:17,365 --> 01:12:19,198
And one day, my war will end.

981
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,434
And I will not die.

982
01:12:22,909 --> 01:12:26,348
And I will not tolerate abuse
from anyone.

983
01:12:29,888 --> 01:12:31,220
I am strong.

984
01:12:31,324 --> 01:12:34,558
My moms kicked me out
when I got jumped into the gang life.

985
01:12:35,733 --> 01:12:38,033
But I'd like her to see me graduate.

986
01:12:39,639 --> 01:12:41,438
I'd like to be 18.

987
01:12:45,751 --> 01:12:49,281
Ms. G?
Can I read something from my diary?

988
01:12:49,391 --> 01:12:50,860
That'd be great.

989
01:12:54,835 --> 01:12:56,497
Who is he?

990
01:12:56,639 --> 01:12:58,733
Man, he's been with us
from freshman year, fool.

991
01:12:58,877 --> 01:13:01,780
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

992
01:13:03,351 --> 01:13:07,815
"This summer was the worst summer
in my short 14 years of life.

993
01:13:08,528 --> 01:13:10,725
"It all started with a phone call.

994
01:13:11,166 --> 01:13:13,602
"My mother was crying and begging,

995
01:13:13,703 --> 01:13:18,667
"asking for more time as if she were
gasping for her last breath of air.

996
01:13:19,681 --> 01:13:22,744
"She held me as tight
as she could and cried.

997
01:13:22,854 --> 01:13:28,297
"Her tears hit my shirt like bullets
and told me we were being evicted.

998
01:13:28,699 --> 01:13:32,661
"She kept apologizing to me.
I thought, 'I have no home.

999
01:13:32,773 --> 01:13:36,577
"'I should have asked for something
less expensive at Christmas.'

1000
01:13:36,681 --> 01:13:40,552
"On the morning of the eviction,
a hard knock on the door woke me up.

1001
01:13:40,654 --> 01:13:43,284
"The sheriff was there to do his job.

1002
01:13:44,194 --> 01:13:47,724
"I looked up at the sky,
waiting for something to happen.

1003
01:13:49,571 --> 01:13:53,135
"My mother has no family to lean on,
no money coming in.

1004
01:13:53,712 --> 01:13:57,379
"Why bother coming to school
or getting good grades if I'm homeless?

1005
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:01,891
"The bus stops in front of the school.
I feel like throwing up.

1006
01:14:01,994 --> 01:14:06,766
"I'm wearing clothes from last year,
some old shoes and no new haircut.

1007
01:14:07,505 --> 01:14:09,839
"I kept thinking I'd get laughed at.

1008
01:14:09,876 --> 01:14:12,346
"Instead, I'm greeted
by a couple of friends

1009
01:14:12,447 --> 01:14:14,781
"who were in my English class last year.

1010
01:14:14,885 --> 01:14:17,789
"And it hits me, Mrs. Gruwell,

1011
01:14:17,891 --> 01:14:20,157
"my crazy English teacher
from last year,

1012
01:14:20,262 --> 01:14:22,926
"is the only person
that made me think of hope.

1013
01:14:24,002 --> 01:14:27,463
"Talking with friends
about last year's English and our trips,

1014
01:14:27,576 --> 01:14:29,603
"I began to feel better.

1015
01:14:30,214 --> 01:14:35,178
"I receive my schedule and the first
teacher is Mrs. Gruwell in Room 203.

1016
01:14:35,524 --> 01:14:38,663
"I walk into the room and feel as though

1017
01:14:38,664 --> 01:14:42,296
"all the problems in life
are not so important anymore.

1018
01:14:42,938 --> 01:14:44,407
"I am home."

1019
01:14:46,411 --> 01:14:47,880
Yes, you are.

1020
01:15:08,519 --> 01:15:10,352
But you're an honors student.

1021
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:12,016
If you transfer to Ms. Gruwell's class,

1022
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:14,186
think how that will reflect
on your records.

1023
01:15:14,331 --> 01:15:17,531
It doesn't matter to me.
My grades will still be the same.

1024
01:15:17,837 --> 01:15:19,704
Look, Ms. Campbell.

1025
01:15:19,808 --> 01:15:23,406
When I first transferred to the school,
I had a 4.0 average.

1026
01:15:23,748 --> 01:15:27,209
But when I applied for advanced
placement at English and Math,

1027
01:15:27,321 --> 01:15:30,259
I was told it would be better for me
to be in a class with my own kind.

1028
01:15:30,361 --> 01:15:33,298
Now, when I did get in, my teacher said,

1029
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:37,032
"Victoria, it's not every day one finds
an African-American student

1030
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:41,011
"in A.P. And honors courses."
As if I didn't notice.

1031
01:15:41,114 --> 01:15:43,516
And when I asked
another honors teacher

1032
01:15:43,652 --> 01:15:46,283
why we don't read more
black literature, she said,

1033
01:15:46,558 --> 01:15:48,527
"We don't read black literature
because of all the sex,

1034
01:15:48,662 --> 01:15:50,824
"drugs, cussing and fornication!"

1035
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:57,604
I thought a simple "It's inappropriate"
would have sufficed.

1036
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:03,755
Erin can't do that!

1037
01:16:04,024 --> 01:16:06,426
Distinguished Honor Students are mine.

1038
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:09,522
She's not allowed to teach them.
She's only been here a year.

1039
01:16:09,567 --> 01:16:11,161
The student requested it.

1040
01:16:11,271 --> 01:16:13,867
And Gruwell has got Cohn
in her back pocket.

1041
01:16:15,145 --> 01:16:20,086
What gets me is they're violent, they
break laws, they destroy school property

1042
01:16:20,321 --> 01:16:25,364
and in the end we make them special.
We reward them like...

1043
01:16:25,365 --> 01:16:27,733
I just don't see what that teaches them.

1044
01:16:28,471 --> 01:16:30,873
Hi! Sorry I'm late.

1045
01:16:31,242 --> 01:16:33,337
Did you eat? I'm ordering in.
Are you hungry?

1046
01:16:33,446 --> 01:16:35,312
What question do you want me
to answer first?

1047
01:16:35,417 --> 01:16:38,320
Did I eat or am I hungry?
I ate. I'm not hungry.

1048
01:16:38,422 --> 01:16:41,690
Something really cool happened today.
I got an honors student.

1049
01:16:41,795 --> 01:16:43,697
- Congratulations.
- Isn't that great?

1050
01:16:43,799 --> 01:16:45,734
She actually requested my class.

1051
01:16:45,836 --> 01:16:47,806
Can you teach an honors student?

1052
01:16:48,173 --> 01:16:49,198
What do you mean?

1053
01:16:49,309 --> 01:16:52,110
Well, I mean, you're used
to teaching your kind of kids.

1054
01:16:52,248 --> 01:16:54,718
Can you teach somebody who's smart?

1055
01:16:55,354 --> 01:16:56,515
Of course I can.

1056
01:16:56,656 --> 01:16:58,522
Yeah, but it's not like you have, right?

1057
01:16:58,626 --> 01:17:01,860
I mean, you don't really teach
what everybody else teaches.

1058
01:17:03,436 --> 01:17:05,133
My kids' grades are up to B's.

1059
01:17:05,306 --> 01:17:07,742
Yeah, but the point is,
that's according to you.

1060
01:17:07,844 --> 01:17:10,645
It's not like they're really learning
what normal kids have to learn.

1061
01:17:10,683 --> 01:17:12,549
Normal kids? Yes, they are.

1062
01:17:12,653 --> 01:17:14,145
They're reading
The Diary of Anne Frank.

1063
01:17:14,257 --> 01:17:16,625
They're learning vocabulary,
grammar, writing, poetry.

1064
01:17:16,728 --> 01:17:19,028
All right. Okay, I apologize. Sorry.

1065
01:17:19,967 --> 01:17:21,526
Congratulations.

1066
01:17:29,618 --> 01:17:30,677
What is wrong with you?

1067
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:32,813
You know, at Deb's party,
I heard you telling people

1068
01:17:32,958 --> 01:17:35,326
that I was an architect
and that my job was temporary.

1069
01:17:35,429 --> 01:17:38,457
I want you to stop that, all right?
I like my job.

1070
01:17:38,569 --> 01:17:39,661
Fine.

1071
01:17:40,639 --> 01:17:42,734
You're the one who said
you were gonna be an architect.

1072
01:17:42,843 --> 01:17:44,870
Yeah, four years ago,
before we got married.

1073
01:17:44,981 --> 01:17:46,574
What, I'm gonna go back to school now

1074
01:17:46,684 --> 01:17:48,586
for two years and intern for three?

1075
01:17:48,688 --> 01:17:50,179
I'll be over 40.

1076
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:52,317
All right. I thought you still wanted it.

1077
01:17:52,428 --> 01:17:56,459
It doesn't matter if I want it, Erin.
It doesn't mean it's going to happen.

1078
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,903
Why not?

1079
01:18:09,126 --> 01:18:13,122
"Writing in a diary is a really strange
experience for someone like me.

1080
01:18:13,267 --> 01:18:15,999
"I mean, not only because
I've never written anything before,

1081
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:18,440
"but also because
it seems to me that later on,

1082
01:18:18,544 --> 01:18:21,344
"neither I nor anyone else
will be interested

1083

1084

are being dragged out of their homes.

1087
01:18:29,498 --> 01:18:30,523
"Families are torn apart."

1088
01:18:30,633 --> 01:18:33,399
"If only I can be myself, I'll be satisfied.

1089
01:18:33,505 --> 01:18:35,236
"I know that I'm a woman
with inner strength

1090
01:18:35,342 --> 01:18:37,107
"and a great deal of courage.

1091
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:40,844
"If God lets me live,
I'll achieve more than Mother ever did."

1092
01:18:40,952 --> 01:18:44,014
"Anti-Jewish decrees followed
in quick succession.

1093
01:18:44,526 --> 01:18:48,830
"Jews must wear a yellow star.
Jews must hand in bicycles.

1094
01:18:49,402 --> 01:18:52,066
"Jews are banned from trams
and forbidden to drive."

1095
01:18:52,207 --> 01:18:54,109
"Jews are forbidden to visit theaters,

1096
01:18:54,211 --> 01:18:56,238
"cinemas and other places

1100
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:09,369
"I can't tell you how oppressive it is
never to be able to go outdoors.

1101
01:19:10,174 --> 01:19:14,877
"Also, I'm very afraid
that we will be discovered and be shot."

1102
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:20,623
"No one can keep out of the conflict.
The entire world is at war.

"the end is nowhere in sight."

1105
01:19:26,973 --> 01:19:27,941
Hi.

1106
01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:31,376
When is Anne gonna smoke Hitler?

1107
01:19:31,982 --> 01:19:35,045
- What?
- You know. T ake him out?

1108
01:19:35,155 --> 01:19:39,755
Eva, this is The Diary of Anne Frank,
not Die Hard.

1109
01:19:40,632 --> 01:19:42,100
Keep reading.

1110
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:46,836
"We talked about
the most private things,

1111
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:50,347
"but we haven't yet touched upon
the things closest to my heart.

1112
01:19:50,449 --> 01:19:52,976
"I still can't make heads
or tails of Peter.

1113
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:54,852
"Is he superficial?

1114
01:19:54,991 --> 01:19:58,395
"Or is it shyness that holds him back,
even with me?"

1115
01:20:04,043 --> 01:20:07,641
- Are Anne and Peter gonna hook up?
- I'm not telling you.

1116
01:20:09,018 --> 01:20:12,081
"It's utterly impossible for me
to build my life on a foundation

"I feel the suffering of millions,
and yet when I look up at the sky

1120
01:20:23,713 --> 01:20:27,447
"I somehow feel that everything
will change for the better."

1121
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:35,698
- Eva, what's wrong?
- Why didn't you tell me she dies?

1122
01:20:35,969 --> 01:20:38,235
Why you didn't tell me she gets caught
in the end?

1123
01:20:38,641 --> 01:20:40,770
I hate you and I hate this book.

1124
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:41,846
Eva.

1125
01:20:41,947 --> 01:20:46,183
If she dies, then what about me?
What are you saying about that?

1126
01:20:47,391 --> 01:20:50,021
- Anne Frank died, but she...
- I can't believe they got her!

1127
01:20:50,129 --> 01:20:52,759
That ain't supposed to happen
in the story! That ain't right!

1128
01:20:52,868 --> 01:20:54,598
- 'Cause it's true?
- I ain't talking to you!

1129
01:20:54,704 --> 01:20:57,402
You're talking around me.
That's the same thing.

1130
01:20:57,509 --> 01:20:59,342
See, to me, she ain't dead at all.

1131
01:20:59,446 --> 01:21:02,144
How many friends did you know
that are dead now that got killed?

1132
01:21:02,285 --> 01:21:03,617
Too many to count.

1133
01:21:03,721 --> 01:21:06,157
How many have you read a book about?

1134
01:21:06,426 --> 01:21:09,398
Have you seen them on TV
or even in the newspaper?

1135
01:21:09,465 --> 01:21:11,093
That's why this story's dope.

1136
01:21:11,202 --> 01:21:12,967
She was our age, man.

1137
01:21:13,106 --> 01:21:16,601
Anne Frank understands our situation,
my situation.

1138
01:21:16,713 --> 01:21:19,650
And that Miep Gies lady,
the one that helped hide them?

1139
01:21:19,751 --> 01:21:20,981
I like her.

1140
01:21:21,088 --> 01:21:23,524
I got all these other books
about her from the library.

1141
01:21:23,625 --> 01:21:26,494
Wow. You used your library card?

1142
01:21:28,434 --> 01:21:29,493
No.

1143
01:21:31,774 --> 01:21:36,545
Okay, listen up.
Marcus has given me an idea.

1144
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:40,545
Instead of doing a book report on
The Diary of Anne Frank,

1145
01:21:40,690 --> 01:21:44,630
for our assignment I want you
to write a letter to Miep Gies,

1146
01:21:44,731 --> 01:21:46,997
the woman who helped shelter
the Franks.

1147
01:21:47,103 --> 01:21:50,564
She's still alive and she lives in Europe.

1148
01:21:50,676 --> 01:21:53,442
In the letter, I want you to tell her
how you feel about the book.

1149
01:21:53,548 --> 01:21:56,042
Tell her about your own experiences.
Tell her anything you like.

1150
01:21:56,154 --> 01:21:58,316
But I want the letters to be perfect,

1151
01:21:58,425 --> 01:22:00,861
so be prepared to do more
than one draft, okay?

1152
01:22:00,962 --> 01:22:02,430
Is she gonna read the letters?

1153
01:22:02,532 --> 01:22:04,934
Well, right now it's
a writing assignment. I'll read them.

1154
01:22:05,103 --> 01:22:06,663
We should get her to read them.

1155
01:22:06,807 --> 01:22:09,869
- Yeah, you can do that, right, Ms. G?
- Well, I don't know.

1156
01:22:09,945 --> 01:22:11,312
Maybe we should get her
to come and speak.

1157
01:22:11,415 --> 01:22:13,247
Yeah, and have a big dinner again.

1158
01:22:15,022 --> 01:22:16,854
Wait. Guys.

1159
01:22:20,064 --> 01:22:23,662
Guys! Everyone! Listen! She's elderly!

1160
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:26,242
I don't know how to contact her.
I don't even know if she travels.

1161
01:22:26,343 --> 01:22:27,972
And it would be really expensive.

1162
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,776
We could raise the money.

1163
01:22:30,718 --> 01:22:31,777
Ms. G?

1164
01:22:31,887 --> 01:22:35,850
When Miep Gies come,
can I, like, be the one to escort her in?

1165
01:22:55,732 --> 01:22:57,030
Five.

1166
01:23:10,459 --> 01:23:11,859
Hi, I'm trying to get the number

1167
01:23:11,962 --> 01:23:14,456
for the Anne Frank Foundation
in Basel, Switzerland.

1168
01:24:29,307 --> 01:24:30,867
Come in, Margaret.

1169
01:25:17,532 --> 01:25:20,332
Ms. G sent our letters all the way
to Amsterdam

1170
01:25:20,437 --> 01:25:22,236
to Miep Gies, herself.

1171
01:25:22,441 --> 01:25:24,638
When Ms. G made up her mind
about something,

1172
01:25:24,746 --> 01:25:27,239
there was no stopping her,
man, for real.

1173
01:25:34,564 --> 01:25:38,698
And after we raised the money to bring
her to Long Beach, there she was.

1174
01:25:41,109 --> 01:25:44,912
But, damn,
I didn't expect her to be so small.

1175
01:26:03,585 --> 01:26:07,115
The bounty on a Jew was about $2.

1176
01:26:07,994 --> 01:26:11,262
Someone desperate for money
told the Gestapo.

1177
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:15,171
On August 4th,
they stormed into my office,

1178
01:26:15,875 --> 01:26:22,251
and a man pointed a gun at me
and said, "Not a sound.

1179
01:26:22,754 --> 01:26:24,383
"Not one word."

1180
01:26:25,526 --> 01:26:28,156
And then they went straight upstairs
to the attic.

1181
01:26:28,698 --> 01:26:31,135
I felt so helpless.

1182
01:26:31,237 --> 01:26:33,799
I could hear Anne screaming,
objects being thrown around.

1183
01:26:33,943 --> 01:26:36,675
So, I ran back to my house.

1184
01:26:36,814 --> 01:26:39,547
I looked for an earring
or knick-knacks, you know,

1185
01:26:39,653 --> 01:26:42,419
anything I could take back with me
to bribe them.

1186
01:26:42,558 --> 01:26:45,860
So I took this back with me,
all these things,

1187
01:26:45,965 --> 01:26:50,269
and the soldier there took out his gun

1188
01:26:50,907 --> 01:26:53,104
and put it against my head.

1189
01:26:57,686 --> 01:27:02,286
You could be shot for hiding a Jew
or go to a camp.

1190
01:27:02,997 --> 01:27:06,959
So, another soldier
recognized my accent.

1191
01:27:07,170 --> 01:27:10,871
He was Austrian, and so was I,

1192
01:27:11,313 --> 01:27:14,079
but I had been adopted
by a Dutch family.

1193
01:27:14,184 --> 01:27:17,988
So, he told the soldier with the gun
to let me go.

1194
01:27:19,895 --> 01:27:24,427
There isn't a day
that I don't remember August 4th

1195
01:27:25,739 --> 01:27:29,576
and I think about Anne Frank.

1196
01:27:32,152 --> 01:27:33,245
Yes?

1197
01:27:41,134 --> 01:27:43,229
I've never had a hero before.

1198
01:27:44,141 --> 01:27:45,609
But you are my hero.

1199
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:49,779
Oh, no. No, no, young man, no.

1200
01:27:49,885 --> 01:27:52,583
I am not a hero. No.

1201
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:59,226
I did what I had to do,
because it was the right thing to do.

1202
01:27:59,636 --> 01:28:01,036
That is all.

1203
01:28:03,076 --> 01:28:05,912
You know, we are all ordinary people.

1204
01:28:06,616 --> 01:28:13,460
But even an ordinary secretary
or a housewife or a teenager

1205
01:28:14,865 --> 01:28:20,775
can, within their own small ways,
turn on a small light

1206
01:28:23,281 --> 01:28:25,080
in a dark room.

1207
01:28:25,652 --> 01:28:26,813
Ja?

1208
01:28:31,029 --> 01:28:34,593
I have read your letters,

1209
01:28:34,702 --> 01:28:39,473
and your teacher has been telling me
many things about your experiences.

1210
01:28:41,615 --> 01:28:44,415
You are the heroes.

1211
01:28:45,723 --> 01:28:49,355
You are heroes every day.

1212
01:28:56,244 --> 01:28:59,682
Your faces are engraved in my heart.

1213
01:29:19,386 --> 01:29:20,752
You hungry?

1214
01:29:25,197 --> 01:29:27,964
You know what you're gonna say
in that courtroom?

1215
01:29:28,603 --> 01:29:30,573
I know what I have to say.

1216
01:29:32,278 --> 01:29:33,371
Yeah.

1217
01:29:34,048 --> 01:29:36,314
- You know how that is.
- I know.

1218
01:29:37,688 --> 01:29:40,318
And that man that put your father
in prison,

1219
01:29:40,426 --> 01:29:43,091
he knew he was sending
an innocent man.

1220
01:29:43,465 --> 01:29:44,763
But, you know,

1221
01:29:46,705 --> 01:29:48,298
he was just

1222
01:29:50,378 --> 01:29:52,108
protecting his own.

1223
01:29:58,327 --> 01:30:01,025
What the hell does everybody
want from me?

1224
01:30:27,849 --> 01:30:29,819
Hey, Mama. Mama.

1225
01:30:35,429 --> 01:30:37,831
What the hell are you doing here?

1226
01:30:44,147 --> 01:30:48,086
I want to come home.
I don't want to be in the streets no more.

1227
01:30:48,187 --> 01:30:49,485
I'm sorry.

1228
01:30:51,994 --> 01:30:55,125
I want to change. I can't do it alone.

1229
01:30:57,037 --> 01:30:58,665
I need you, Mama.

1230
01:31:00,477 --> 01:31:01,945
I need you.

1231
01:31:39,650 --> 01:31:41,415
And what time was that?

1232
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:44,588
I told you, 9:00, 9:30.

1233
01:31:45,261 --> 01:31:46,729
And you had a clear view
of the defendant,

1234
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:48,697
Grant Rice, in the store?

1235
01:31:49,903 --> 01:31:52,271
I told you he was playing
the video game.

1236
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:55,346
Then what happened?
What did you see?

1237
01:31:55,781 --> 01:31:57,876
Well, he got all whacked
because he lost the game,

1238
01:31:58,019 --> 01:32:01,617
and then he started shouting and all,
threatening everybody.

1239
01:32:01,725 --> 01:32:04,925
He threatened everyone?
He threatened you?

1240
01:32:06,034 --> 01:32:08,470
No. The guy who ran the store.

1241
01:32:08,605 --> 01:32:10,632
He wanted his money back
for the game.

1242
01:32:10,676 --> 01:32:12,702
And what did the store owner do?

1243
01:32:13,547 --> 01:32:16,849
He shouted back.
And they were fighting.

1244
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:21,390
Then he, the defendant, knocked
something over and left the store.

1245
01:32:21,963 --> 01:32:24,456
And then what happened?
What did you see?

1246
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:30,271
I saw...

1247
01:32:42,469 --> 01:32:43,937
I saw...

1248
01:32:59,233 --> 01:33:00,701
Paco did it.

1249
01:33:04,878 --> 01:33:06,608
Paco killed the guy.

1250
01:34:32,309 --> 01:34:34,802
My father won't talk to me anymore.

1251
01:34:37,184 --> 01:34:42,558
And I have to lay low for a little while
because there's word out to jump me.

1252
01:34:43,964 --> 01:34:46,264
So I'm gonna be living with my aunt.

1253
01:34:47,737 --> 01:34:52,701
See, my aunt lives even further away,

1254
01:34:54,784 --> 01:34:59,088
so I was just wondering if I could, like,

1255
01:35:02,231 --> 01:35:03,902
stay here late with you

1256
01:35:03,902 --> 01:35:05,803
stay here late with you

1257
01:35:07,675 --> 01:35:12,173
so I can get my homework done,
'cause it's late by the time I get home.

1258
01:35:14,655 --> 01:35:17,626
You can stay as late as you want.

1259
01:35:18,996 --> 01:35:22,958
And I can even drive you to your aunt's,
if it gets too late.

1260
01:35:26,209 --> 01:35:28,041
Ms. G, let's not get nuts.

1261
01:36:03,848 --> 01:36:05,784
I think I got your color.

1262
01:36:52,505 --> 01:36:54,498
Just come by the concierge
on your way out,

1263
01:36:54,609 --> 01:36:57,376
I'll have the directions for you.
Yep, that's fine.

1264
01:37:04,428 --> 01:37:08,231
Stop! That's it! Now, now! Hey!

1265
01:37:09,971 --> 01:37:12,442
You get an extra three seconds. Go!

1266
01:37:18,622 --> 01:37:20,888
...enraged them and provoked them
into acts of violence.

1267
01:37:20,993 --> 01:37:25,262
In 1961, an interracial civil rights group
traveled by bus through the South

1268
01:37:25,368 --> 01:37:27,098
to challenge segregation.

1269
01:37:27,204 --> 01:37:30,074
Blacks sat in the front,
whites in the back.

1270
01:37:30,544 --> 01:37:34,074
They were attacked, firebombed,
but they kept going.

1271
01:37:34,685 --> 01:37:38,852
In Montgomery, Alabama, Jim Zwerg
offered to be the first off the bus,

1272
01:37:38,959 --> 01:37:41,327
knowing there was a mob
waiting for them.

1273
01:37:41,463 --> 01:37:44,435
He was almost beaten to death
so the others could get away.

1274
01:37:44,536 --> 01:37:48,031
That kind of courage
is unbelievable to me.

1275
01:37:48,176 --> 01:37:51,546
I was afraid of just being in this class,
and I was ashamed

1276
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:55,419
because I've always been the dumb kid
in school, even with my friends.

1277
01:37:55,591 --> 01:37:56,958
But not anymore.

1278
01:37:57,127 --> 01:37:58,652
And I must have some kind of courage,

1279
01:37:58,763 --> 01:38:02,497
because I could have lied
to get out of here, but I stayed.

1280
01:38:03,572 --> 01:38:04,870
I stayed.

1281
01:38:05,309 --> 01:38:06,607
Hi, I'm home!

1282
01:38:07,212 --> 01:38:12,154
Sorry, it got late. I drove the kids home.
I didn't want them taking buses.

1283
01:38:12,689 --> 01:38:15,057
You're never gonna believe
what happened.

1284
01:38:16,429 --> 01:38:18,092
I'm so tired.

1285
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:21,470
It's so cute, though.
They never want to go home.

1286
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:25,374
We have such a good time together.
I'm gonna take a shower.

1287
01:38:45,017 --> 01:38:48,113
If you have another glass,
you're gonna have a headache.

1288
01:38:48,891 --> 01:38:53,298
Your bags are packed and you think
the wine's gonna give me a headache?

1289
01:38:55,302 --> 01:38:57,067
Why are you doing this?

1290
01:38:57,173 --> 01:39:00,441
Because I don't
pay enough attention to you?

1291
01:39:00,546 --> 01:39:02,516
No. That's not it.

1292
01:39:04,888 --> 01:39:08,952
I just... I feel like I'm living a life
I just did not agree to.

1293
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:12,928
Erin, it's just...

1294
01:39:14,172 --> 01:39:15,663
It's too hard.

1295
01:39:16,275 --> 01:39:18,438
Your life is too hard?

1296
01:39:18,948 --> 01:39:21,475
I think what you're doing is noble.

1297
01:39:22,086 --> 01:39:25,650
And it's good. And I'm proud of you.

1298
01:39:26,261 --> 01:39:27,559
I am.

1299
01:39:29,901 --> 01:39:33,203
I just want to live my life
and not feel bad about it.

1300
01:39:33,307 --> 01:39:36,473
- I'm not trying to make you feel bad.
- You don't have to try.

1301
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:39,380
I didn't plan on becoming responsible
for these kids.

1302
01:39:39,486 --> 01:39:41,513
- Well, who asked you to?
- No one asked me to!

1303
01:39:41,624 --> 01:39:42,614
They're not even your kids!

1304
01:39:42,726 --> 01:39:46,529
Why do I have to be asked? Scott...

1305
01:39:50,674 --> 01:39:55,581
I finally realized what I'm
supposed to be doing and I love it.

1306
01:39:55,716 --> 01:40:00,384
When I'm helping these kids
make sense of their lives,

1307
01:40:01,027 --> 01:40:03,862
everything about my life
makes sense to me.

1308
01:40:07,405 --> 01:40:09,773
How often does a person get that?

1309
01:40:13,083 --> 01:40:17,182
- Then what do you need me for?
- You're my husband.

1310
01:40:17,290 --> 01:40:22,198
Why can't you stand by me and be part
of it, the way wives support husbands?

1311
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:24,166
Because I can't be your wife.

1312
01:40:31,484 --> 01:40:33,784
I wish I could make that
sound less awful.

1313
01:40:35,958 --> 01:40:37,119
Erin?

1314
01:40:38,731 --> 01:40:41,293
You know,
if you had to choose between us

1315
01:40:42,804 --> 01:40:44,433
and the class,

1316
01:40:46,244 --> 01:40:47,678
who would you pick?

1317
01:40:49,718 --> 01:40:53,179
If you love me,
how could you ever ask me that?

1318
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:55,788
Erin, look at me.

1319
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:01,466
This is all there's ever been to me.

1320
01:41:01,841 --> 01:41:06,213
This is it. I'm not one of those kids.
I don't have any more potential.

1321
01:41:08,053 --> 01:41:09,578
See? You don't want to be here either,

1322
01:41:09,722 --> 01:41:13,058
'cause if you did, would you be
in the classroom every night?

1323
01:41:14,397 --> 01:41:19,031
That's not true. I want to be here.
I love you.

1324
01:41:20,208 --> 01:41:22,178
You love the idea of me.

1325
01:41:27,724 --> 01:41:30,024
But it's such a great idea.

1326
01:41:33,701 --> 01:41:34,999
I know.

1327
01:42:03,090 --> 01:42:04,888
Dad? Hi.

1328
01:42:07,498 --> 01:42:10,697
You know, I was actually trying
to call someone else,

1329
01:42:10,837 --> 01:42:12,807
and I automatically dialed you. I'm sorry.

1330
01:42:12,841 --> 01:42:15,403
Look, I'm gonna call you tomorrow,
okay?

1331
01:42:15,547 --> 01:42:18,848
I need to make this call. I love you.

1332
01:42:31,909 --> 01:42:34,403
Ms. G made us read Twelve Angry Men.

1333
01:42:34,515 --> 01:42:38,155
It's all about how this one juror
helped to turn the hearts of 11 jurors.

1334
01:42:38,156 --> 01:42:40,022
It made me feel hopeful.

1335
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:43,828
At 2:00 today, my brother
was given a verdict on his own trial.

1336
01:42:43,967 --> 01:42:46,597
No O.J. Dream Team,
just a court-appointed attorney

1337
01:42:46,738 --> 01:42:48,708
who probably thought
his ass was guilty.

1338
01:42:48,842 --> 01:42:52,474
And I realized Twelve Angry Men
was just a book and nothing more.

1339
01:42:52,816 --> 01:42:55,549
My brother got 15 years to life.

1340
01:42:55,655 --> 01:42:58,387
Justice don't mean
the bad guy goes to jail.

1341
01:42:58,493 --> 01:43:00,690
It just means somebody
pays for the crime.

1342
01:43:06,542 --> 01:43:08,067
So, you got time now?

1343
01:43:14,958 --> 01:43:16,552
Anyone know where Andre's been?

1344
01:43:16,695 --> 01:43:17,958
I haven't seen him on the bus.

1345
01:43:18,097 --> 01:43:19,565
Yeah, I haven't talked to him either.

1346
01:43:28,483 --> 01:43:30,008
Ms. G?

1347
01:43:30,386 --> 01:43:32,720
Are we gonna have
this same room next year, again?

1348
01:43:32,825 --> 01:43:35,955
I don't know.
You're gonna be juniors next year.

1349
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:39,025
What do you mean?

1350
01:43:39,136 --> 01:43:41,834
Well, I teach freshman
and sophomore years.

1351
01:43:41,941 --> 01:43:45,072
You mean,
we're not gonna be with you next year?

1352
01:43:47,786 --> 01:43:49,152
Well, I...

1353
01:43:51,026 --> 01:43:54,760
I don't teach juniors.
I thought you guys understood that.

1354
01:43:55,268 --> 01:43:56,395
What? What are you talking about?

1355
01:43:58,607 --> 01:44:00,235
You don't wanna be our teacher
next year?

1356
01:44:00,343 --> 01:44:02,870
Of course I do. I can't.

1357
01:44:02,981 --> 01:44:05,474
- Why not?
- It's the Board of Ed.

1358
01:44:05,587 --> 01:44:07,522
It's regulations.

1359
01:44:10,262 --> 01:44:13,062
Ms. G hasn't been here long enough
to have seniority.

1360
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:14,432
Who cares about seniority?

1361
01:44:14,569 --> 01:44:17,131
Shit! They can't do that!
They don't have the right!

1362
01:44:19,245 --> 01:44:22,046
- Ms. G, this is our kick-it spot.
- Yeah.

1363
01:44:22,184 --> 01:44:25,623
Everybody's cool with everybody.
Everybody knows everybody.

1364
01:44:25,758 --> 01:44:29,197
This is the only place
where we really get to be ourselves.

1365
01:44:29,332 --> 01:44:31,359
There's no place like this
out there for us.

1366
01:44:31,636 --> 01:44:33,036
That's true.

1367
01:44:33,539 --> 01:44:36,102
I'm not allowed
to teach junior and seniors.

1368
01:44:36,244 --> 01:44:37,212
You're not allowed?

1369
01:44:39,249 --> 01:44:42,881
Ms. G, we can fight this, you know,
like the Freedom Riders.

1370
01:44:42,990 --> 01:44:44,755
Yeah, yeah,
we'll all drive around on a bus.

1371
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:46,853
Only this time, they try and bust us up,

1372
01:44:46,964 --> 01:44:48,762
we bust a few of them
board members' heads.

1373
01:44:49,402 --> 01:44:50,392
Marcus.

1374
01:44:50,504 --> 01:44:54,136
Or we can go to the newspapers,
media. That'll get their attention.

1375
01:44:54,378 --> 01:44:55,846
Or we can paint
the administration building

1376
01:44:55,981 --> 01:44:58,451
with the word "assholes"
in various colors.

1377
01:45:00,189 --> 01:45:01,886
Hey, it's something. We can do this.

1378
01:45:07,336 --> 01:45:08,304
What?

1379
01:45:08,405 --> 01:45:11,969
These are my books, not Scott's.
I'm packing the wrong books.

1380
01:45:12,078 --> 01:45:13,775
Honey, take a break.

1381
01:45:17,722 --> 01:45:19,190
Sit down.

1382
01:45:22,364 --> 01:45:24,960
I can't believe I'm getting divorced.

1383
01:45:26,439 --> 01:45:28,875
I never thought this would happen.

1384
01:45:32,850 --> 01:45:34,945
What do I do now?

1385
01:45:35,924 --> 01:45:38,394
Next year, I won't even have my kids.

1386
01:45:38,795 --> 01:45:41,095
You think you should stay with them?

1387
01:45:41,968 --> 01:45:44,268
Or is it better they move on?

1388
01:45:44,606 --> 01:45:46,074
I don't know.

1389
01:45:49,883 --> 01:45:52,353
It's just a job, like you said.

1390
01:45:52,454 --> 01:45:54,082
Yeah, it is.

1391
01:45:55,025 --> 01:45:56,995
But is the job finished?

1392
01:45:59,334 --> 01:46:00,927
Listen to me now.

1393
01:46:01,203 --> 01:46:03,730
What you've done with those kids...

1394
01:46:06,147 --> 01:46:08,447
I don't even have words for it.

1395
01:46:10,188 --> 01:46:15,152
But one thing's for sure,
you are an amazing teacher.

1396
01:46:17,034 --> 01:46:18,400
Special.

1397
01:46:19,172 --> 01:46:23,578
You have been blessed with a burden,
my daughter.

1398
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:27,520
And I envy you that.

1399
01:46:30,225 --> 01:46:31,854
And I admire you.

1400
01:46:34,366 --> 01:46:38,362
And how many fathers ever get
to say that to their daughters

1401
01:46:38,507 --> 01:46:40,477
and really mean it?

1402
01:46:44,351 --> 01:46:47,448
What she is suggesting
is in violation of our union charter.

1403
01:46:47,558 --> 01:46:50,724
She may not move on with her students
to teach them junior year.

1404
01:46:50,831 --> 01:46:52,823
She's only been here two years.

1405
01:46:52,935 --> 01:46:55,029
There are teachers here
who have tenure,

1406
01:46:55,138 --> 01:46:57,404
who have worked and committed
themselves for far longer

1407
01:46:57,509 --> 01:46:59,411
to attain a position of seniority.

1408
01:46:59,513 --> 01:47:03,476
Not to mention their experience
in teaching students of a higher caliber.

1409
01:47:03,588 --> 01:47:06,388
The Distinguished Scholars Program
is under our jurisdiction.

1410
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:09,327
I don't want to replace
the Distinguished Scholars Program.

1411
01:47:09,466 --> 01:47:11,367
I just want to stay
with my kids next year.

1412
01:47:11,469 --> 01:47:13,666
She can't. I have the juniors.

1413
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:15,767
The Board of Education
will not allow this.

1414
01:47:15,910 --> 01:47:17,846
Teaching rotations will be disrupted,

1415
01:47:17,948 --> 01:47:20,248
retirement schedules
will be reevaluated,

1416
01:47:20,352 --> 01:47:23,791
disrespecting teachers
who have earned their way far longer

1417
01:47:23,893 --> 01:47:26,056
and who focus on the classroom,

1418
01:47:26,164 --> 01:47:28,999
not on public relations
and newspaper articles.

1419
01:47:29,102 --> 01:47:31,095
I didn't ask for those articles
to be written.

1420
01:47:31,206 --> 01:47:32,698
She's in the middle of a divorce.

1421
01:47:32,810 --> 01:47:35,303
Note, they stay late in her class,
they're eating, they're playing games!

1422
01:47:35,415 --> 01:47:38,511
All right, let's all just take a breath here.
All right?

1423
01:47:39,956 --> 01:47:42,050
Now I had hoped
that we could talk this out,

1424
01:47:42,194 --> 01:47:43,890
maybe come to some kind
of arrangement.

1425
01:47:44,030 --> 01:47:46,500
- There is no arrangement...
- Margaret.

1426
01:47:47,370 --> 01:47:48,838
Carl, look.

1427
01:47:49,441 --> 01:47:52,503
Putting aside all obvious resentments
for the moment,

1428
01:47:52,613 --> 01:47:54,013
even if an arrangement were made

1429
01:47:54,116 --> 01:47:58,249
and she could teach them as juniors,
there isn't an accredited course

1430
01:47:58,358 --> 01:48:00,726
in the curriculum for her to teach.

1431
01:48:01,364 --> 01:48:05,030
Unless Brian trades one of his
junior classes for a sophomore.

1432
01:48:05,137 --> 01:48:06,196
No.

1433
01:48:07,976 --> 01:48:10,208
Then there's nothing I can do.

1434
01:48:13,754 --> 01:48:15,052
So that's it?

1435
01:48:16,191 --> 01:48:17,659
Believe it or not, Ms. Gruwell,

1436
01:48:17,761 --> 01:48:20,493
there are other capable teachers
in this school.

1437
01:48:20,632 --> 01:48:22,625
If you've made the progress
you say you have,

1438
01:48:22,770 --> 01:48:24,433
your students should be ready
to move on.

1439
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:27,204
They might even gain something
from more experienced teachers.

1440
01:48:27,311 --> 01:48:30,579
You can't teach them.
You don't even like them.

1441
01:48:30,684 --> 01:48:32,517
What does that have to do
with teaching?

1442
01:48:32,623 --> 01:48:35,219
I've been an educator for over 30 years.

1443
01:48:35,628 --> 01:48:37,325
I have students that still remain
in touch with me.

1444
01:48:37,432 --> 01:48:39,868
I know what it is to be loved
by a classroom!

1445
01:48:39,969 --> 01:48:42,941
You have no idea
how many battles I've had

1446
01:48:43,042 --> 01:48:44,704
fighting to be a better teacher,

1447
01:48:44,812 --> 01:48:48,182
and now, what, suddenly I'm incapable
of educating your students?

1448
01:48:48,285 --> 01:48:50,949
You know, if they move on
to our classes and they fail,

1449
01:48:51,089 --> 01:48:53,150
it'll be because they weren't prepared!

1450
01:48:53,294 --> 01:48:55,993
It'll be because you failed, not them!

1451
01:49:14,602 --> 01:49:17,266
Andre? Wait a minute before you go in.

1452
01:49:30,531 --> 01:49:33,001
I heard about your brother's conviction.
I'm sorry.

1453
01:49:33,135 --> 01:49:35,332
Is that why you've missed class
so much?

1454
01:49:35,439 --> 01:49:37,238
I had things to do.

1455
01:49:40,516 --> 01:49:42,314
About this.

1456
01:49:42,787 --> 01:49:43,948
The evaluation assignment

1457
01:49:44,057 --> 01:49:45,525
was to grade yourself
on the work you're doing.

1458
01:49:45,626 --> 01:49:48,062
You gave yourself an F.
What's that about?

1459
01:49:48,465 --> 01:49:51,664
- It's what I feel I deserve. That's all.
- Oh, really?

1460
01:49:53,241 --> 01:49:54,937
You know what this is?

1461
01:49:55,244 --> 01:49:59,241
This is a "Fuck you" to me,
and everyone in this class!

1462
01:49:59,385 --> 01:50:02,653
I don't want excuses.
I know what you're up against.

1463
01:50:02,992 --> 01:50:05,224
We're all of us up against something.

1464
01:50:06,198 --> 01:50:09,568
So you better make up your mind,
because until you have the balls

1465
01:50:09,671 --> 01:50:12,471
to look me straight in the eye
and tell me this is all you deserve,

1466
01:50:12,576 --> 01:50:14,135
I am not letting you fail,

1467
01:50:14,179 --> 01:50:16,240
even if that means coming
to your house every night

1468
01:50:16,350 --> 01:50:18,047
until you finish the work.

1469
01:50:18,153 --> 01:50:19,951
I see who you are.

1470
01:50:20,492 --> 01:50:22,621
Do you understand me?

1471
01:50:23,632 --> 01:50:25,601
I can see you.

1472
01:50:27,472 --> 01:50:29,407
And you are not failing.

1473
01:50:32,848 --> 01:50:37,790
So, take a minute.
Pull yourself together and come inside.

1474
01:50:38,325 --> 01:50:40,352
I want a new evaluation.

1475
01:50:45,571 --> 01:50:48,372
An F. What, are you tripping?

1476
01:50:54,055 --> 01:50:57,516
I want you all to know that
Dr. Cohn and I tried very hard.

1477
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:03,169
But it's been decided we can't continue
with each other junior year.

1478
01:51:03,305 --> 01:51:04,398
- What?
- What?

1479
01:51:06,044 --> 01:51:07,945
You... Wait.

1480
01:51:08,682 --> 01:51:10,652
Wait. Guys. Everyone.

1481
01:51:12,055 --> 01:51:14,525
No! That don't fly, Ma!

1482
01:51:16,096 --> 01:51:19,763
Look, first of all,
I'm not anyone's mother in here, okay?

1483
01:51:19,870 --> 01:51:22,066
No, it doesn't mean mother.

1484
01:51:22,775 --> 01:51:25,109
It's a sign of respect for you.

1485
01:51:39,340 --> 01:51:40,740
Listen to me.

1486
01:51:40,977 --> 01:51:42,275
All of you.

1487
01:51:43,046 --> 01:51:47,680
Don't use me as another excuse
for why you can't make it.

1488
01:51:49,592 --> 01:51:52,894
You made it to your junior year.

1489
01:51:53,700 --> 01:51:56,500
Think about how you did that.

1490
01:51:57,874 --> 01:52:01,540
Everyone in this room
has a chance to graduate.

1491
01:52:02,583 --> 01:52:05,145
For some,
you'll be the first in your family.

1492
01:52:05,254 --> 01:52:08,021
The first with a choice to go to college.

1493
01:52:09,030 --> 01:52:11,830
Some may move faster than others.

1494
01:52:13,437 --> 01:52:15,737
But you'll each have the chance.

1495
01:52:16,810 --> 01:52:19,782
And you did that. Not me.

1496
01:52:26,863 --> 01:52:30,529
Now, I have one

1497
01:52:32,573 --> 01:52:34,166
final project in mind.

1498
01:52:34,276 --> 01:52:36,473
- Ms. G.
- Yeah?

1499
01:52:38,317 --> 01:52:43,281
Ms. G wanted us to put our diaries
together in a book, just like Anne Frank.

1500
01:52:44,029 --> 01:52:46,055
She got this businessman, John Tu,

1501
01:52:46,199 --> 01:52:49,035
to donate 35 computers
so we could work.

1502
01:52:54,114 --> 01:52:57,518
She told us we have something
to say to people.

1503
01:52:57,687 --> 01:52:57,787
We weren't just kids
in a class anymore.

1504
01:52:57,787 --> 01:53:00,087
We weren't just kids
in a class anymore.

1505
01:53:00,191 --> 01:53:03,891
We were writers with our own voices,
our own stories.

1506
01:53:03,999 --> 01:53:06,059
And even if nobody else read it,

1507
01:53:06,169 --> 01:53:09,768
the book would be something
to leave behind that said we were here,

1508
01:53:10,377 --> 01:53:13,474
this is what happened, we mattered.

1509
01:53:13,951 --> 01:53:18,221
Even if it was just to each other.
And we won't forget.

1510
01:53:19,929 --> 01:53:22,297
Ms. G didn't promise
it would get published or anything,

1511
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:25,270
but we could get it out there ourselves.

1512
01:53:26,007 --> 01:53:28,239
She asked us to come up with a title,

1513
01:53:28,779 --> 01:53:30,748
something to call ourselves.

1514
01:53:48,549 --> 01:53:50,415
I just received a call
from Karin Polacheck

1515
01:53:50,552 --> 01:53:51,645
at the Board of Education.

1516
01:53:51,788 --> 01:53:53,781
There's to be a meeting
with Dr. Cohn about your classes.

1517
01:53:53,926 --> 01:53:57,365
- Do you know anything about this?
- No.

1518
01:54:05,181 --> 01:54:10,647
These students, this class,
they've become a family.

1519
01:54:11,559 --> 01:54:13,153
To who? To you?

1520
01:54:13,830 --> 01:54:15,459
To each other.

1521
01:54:16,268 --> 01:54:19,604
Room 203 is a kind of a home for them.

1522
01:54:20,142 --> 01:54:23,477
Their trust is all wrapped up
in us being together as a group.

1523
01:54:23,916 --> 01:54:25,043
Once they're out of her class,

1524
01:54:25,185 --> 01:54:27,621
believe me they'll slip back
into their old habits.

1525
01:54:27,722 --> 01:54:31,685
Their reading scores, their writing
has markedly improved, Ms. Campbell.

1526
01:54:31,832 --> 01:54:35,327
On paper. But what has
she accomplished in reality?

1527
01:54:35,438 --> 01:54:37,066
What about new students
that come in next year?

1528
01:54:37,174 --> 01:54:39,167
Can she repeat
this process every year?

1529
01:54:39,278 --> 01:54:40,678
Her methods are impractical,

1530
01:54:40,781 --> 01:54:43,412
impossible to implement with regularity.

1531
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:46,013
What if every teacher
performed in this way?

1532
01:54:46,625 --> 01:54:47,854
We have millions of children

1533
01:54:47,961 --> 01:54:49,692
to get through the education system
in this country,

1534
01:54:49,798 --> 01:54:51,631
and we need a means
of accomplishing that

1535
01:54:51,735 --> 01:54:54,638
which allows as many students
to benefit as possible,

1536
01:54:54,740 --> 01:54:56,676
not just special cases.

1537
01:54:58,180 --> 01:55:01,641
And you honestly think you can create
this family in every classroom,

1538
01:55:01,786 --> 01:55:04,758
for every grade,
for every student you teach?

1539
01:55:09,335 --> 01:55:10,803
I don't know.

1540
01:55:17,016 --> 01:55:18,348
Thank you.

1541
01:55:38,756 --> 01:55:41,659
Hey, there go Ms. G.
Hey, there go Ms. G!

1542
01:55:50,579 --> 01:55:51,979
What happened?

1543
01:55:52,783 --> 01:55:56,586
So? Are we gonna be together
for junior year?

1544
01:56:02,434 --> 01:56:03,732
No.

1545
01:56:04,672 --> 01:56:06,539
- What?
- What?

1546
01:56:11,150 --> 01:56:14,520
We're gonna be together junior
and senior year.

1547
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:17,019
Yes!

1548
01:57:02,070 --> 01:57:13,843
THE END
