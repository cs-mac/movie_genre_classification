<i>KENNY LOGGINS SINGING:
Revvin' up your engines.</i>

2
00:02:56,225 --> 00:02:59,251
<i>Listen to her how I and roar.</i>

3
00:03:00,929 --> 00:03:02,260
<i>Metal under tension...</i>

4
00:03:02,297 --> 00:03:04,993
<i>beggin' you to touch and go.</i>

00:03:06,835 --> 00:03:11,772
<i>Highway to the danger zone.</i>

00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:17,672
<i>Ride into the danger zone.</i>

00:03:22,217 --> 00:03:23,650
<i>Headin' into twilight...</i>

00:03:23,685 --> 00:03:26,153
<i>spreadin' out her wings tonight.</i>

00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:29,648
<i>She's got you

<i>Highway to the danger zone.</i>

14
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:09,621
<i>Gonna take you
right into the danger zone.</i>

15
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:14,004
Morning, Scott.
Morning, Wells.

16
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:24,431
Ghost Rider, we have an unknown
aircraft. Vector 090 for bogey.

17
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:38,237
- Who's up there?
- Cougar, Merlin, Maverick and Goose.

18
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,406
Great. Maverick and Goose.

19
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:56,296
- Talk to me, Goose.
- Roger, I got them. 900 knots closure.

20
00:04:56,547 --> 00:05:00,050
- Cougar, you hear that?
- Roger.

21
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,470
- Merlin, you got them?
- I've got radar contact.

22
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,101
- I'll get a visual ID. You hook them.
- I'll clean them and fry them.

23
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:23,240
Ghost Rider, 203. I have them inbound,
bogeyheading 270 at 10 miles.

24
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,036
- 900 knots closure.
- Take angels 10, left, 3, 0.

25
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:31,707
- Are we expecting visitors?
- Negative, sir.

26
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:42,843
- Merlin, see if he's a single.
- Roger.

27
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:48,682
Do you see a trailer?.
Looks like he's a single.

28
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:55,606
- I'm gonna go head-to-head with him.
- Take it easy. I'll see if he's really alone.

29
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:20,255
- He's coming right at us, Mav.
- Okay, buddy. What's on your mind?

30
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:30,140
- Shit, there's two of them. MiG-28s!
- What? What's their position?

31
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,102
- 250 miles out, sir.
- Get them out of here!

32
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,734
Cougar, you've got MiG one.
I'm going after MiG two.

33
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:47,491
I lost him in the sun! Shit, what's
he doing? You got him, Merlin?

34
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,538
He's coming around on our tail!

35
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:56,375
Goddamn it. This bogey's all over me.

36
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:05,133
What's their range now?. If they break
150 miles, launch the alert five aircraft.

37
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:12,474
- Airspeed 300. Go get them, Mav!
- I'm going for missile lock.

38
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:19,398
Let's see if we can scare him
out of here. Lock up, baby.

39
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:23,443
I've got him locked. Bingo!

40
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:34,329
- We got him, Mav. He's bugging out.
- Mustang, MiG two is headed home.

41
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,667
- What's their position?
- 180 miles and bearing 010, sir.

42
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:47,009
- He's got missile lock on us!
- He's engaging me.

43
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:53,098
Goddamn it. Mustang,
this bogey's all over me.

44
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:57,603
- Do I have permission to fire?
- Do not fire until fired upon.

45
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:05,360
- There they are.
- The MiG's in perfect firing position.

46
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:11,241
- No way. He would have fired by now.
- Maverick, get this asshole off me!

47
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:20,250
Easy, Cougar. Bring him back,
hard right. Help me engage.

48
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,961
I'm on my way.

49
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,813
I can't shoot, so let's have a little fun.

50
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,655
Is this your idea of fun?

51
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,869
Greetings.

52
00:08:57,246 --> 00:09:00,332
Watch the birdie.

53
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,252
Geez, I crack myself up.

54
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,886
Great shot.
I should be a photographer.

55
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,889
Cougar, your tail is clear.
MiG one has bugged out.

56
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:32,281
Cougar, we've had enough fun
for one day, don't you think?.

57
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:36,285
I'm getting low on fuel,
so we're heading home.

58
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:41,957
We'll see you on deck.

59
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,676
We're running low on gas.

60
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:58,056
Cougar?.

61
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:02,060
We're on vapour.
Let's do it.

62
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,899
Cougar, come on!

63
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:21,663
- Let's take ltback to the ship, man.
- Get him on deck as soon as possible.

64
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:29,254
Cougar, we've got to land this thing.
We are way low on gas.

65
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:31,173
Are you all right?

66
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:42,726
- Maverick, call the ball.
- Roger. Maverick has the ball.

67
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:50,108
- Cougar's in trouble.
- Come on, we're getting low on gas.

68
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:54,154
- Let's land this sucker.
- Cougar!

69
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,915
- Goddamn it!
- We've got no fuel for this.

70
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,835
We're going after Cougar.

71
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:15,175
- Tell him to land. That's an order!
- You're instructed to land immediately.

72
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,850
Have you boys seen an aircraft carrier?.

73
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:29,356
That MiG really screwed him up.
I don't think he can make it back.

74
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:38,949
You're okay, Cougar. Just stay on
my wing. I'll take you all the way in.

75
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,135
Easy, Cougar.
Just a walk in the park, buddy.

76
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:04,141
You're a little low. You're a little low.
Come on, buddy, pull up.

77
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,977
Pull up, Cougar.

78
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,065
That's it. Almost there.

79
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:16,320
A little below glide path. Call the ball.

80
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,866
Rogerball.

81
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:34,796
You're too low. Increase power!

82
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,019
Come in.

83
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:58,487
- What's on your mind?
- My wife and kid, sir.

84
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:03,534
I almost orphaned him today.
I've never even seen him.

85
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:08,038
- I was so scared.
- We've seen this before.

86
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,832
No, sir.

87
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:17,005
I'm holding on too tight.
I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, sir.

88
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,726
Cougar?.

89
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:34,731
Thanks, Maverick.

90
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:39,570
- Maverick, Goose, come in here.
- What the hell's going on?

91
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,407
- I don't know.
- Shit.

92
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:51,290
Maverick,
you just did an incredibly brave thing.

93
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:58,630
What you should have done was land
your plane. It belongs to the taxpayers!

94
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:01,884
Your ego's writing cheques
your body can't cash.

95
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:06,847
You've lost your qualifications
as section leader three times.

96
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:11,476
Put in hack twice by me
with a history of high-speed passes -

97
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:15,606
- over five air control towers
and one admiral's daughter!

98
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:22,446
- Penny Benjamin?
- You, asshole, you're lucky to be here.

99
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:26,950
Let's not bullshit. Your family name
ain't the best in the Navy.

100
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:31,747
You need to be doing it
better and cleaner than the other guy.

101
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:36,710
- Just want to serve my country, sir.
- Don't screw around with me.

102
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,465
You're a hell of a pilot. Maybe too good.
I'd like to bust your butt -

103
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:47,679
- but I have another problem here.
I have to send somebody to Miramar.

104
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:53,894
I've got to do something. I can't believe
it. I have to give you your dream shot.

105
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:59,650
I have to send you up against the best.
You characters are going to Top Gun.

106
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:04,780
For five weeks,
you're going to fly against the best.

107
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:10,244
You were number two. Cougar was
number one. He turned in his wings.

108
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:15,582
You guys are number one.
But you remember one thing:

109
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:21,839
You screw up, you'll be flying
a cargo plane full of rubber dog shit.

110
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,967
Yes, sir!

111
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,762
That is all.

112
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:33,225
Tell me about the MiG some other time.
Gentlemen?

113
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:37,980
- Good luck, gentlemen.
- Thank you, sir.

114
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:43,830
<i>Out along the edge...</i>

115
00:15:43,872 --> 00:15:46,397
<i>is always where I burn to be.</i>

116
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:52,836
<i>The further on the edge,
the hotter the intensity.</i>

117
00:15:55,016 --> 00:15:59,510
<i>Highway to the danger zone.</i>

118
00:16:00,188 --> 00:16:05,751
<i>Gonna take you
right into the danger zone.</i>

119
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:12,460
<i>Highway to the danger zone.</i>

120
00:16:13,435 --> 00:16:18,896
<i>Right into the danger zone...</i>

121
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:24,818
During Korea, we shot down 12
of theirjets for every one of ours.

122
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:32,201
During Vietnam, that ratio fell to 3-1 .
Our pilots were dependant on missiles.

123
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:37,789
Top Gun was created to teach ACM.
Air Combat Manoeuvring. Dogfighting.

124
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,336
- This gives me a hard-on.
- By the end of Vietnam, it was 12-1 .

125
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,631
- Don't tease me.
- Blinds, please.

126
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:51,720
Our commanding officer was the very
first man to win the Top Gun trophy.

127
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:57,142
You won't find a finer fighter pilot
anywhere. Commander Mike Metcalf.

128
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:01,480
- Call sign, Viper.
- Gentlemen ...

129
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,984
You're the top one percent
of all naval aviators.

130
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:13,116
The elite. The best of the best.
We'll make you better.

131
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:20,457
You fly at least two combat missions
a day, attend classes and evaluations.

132
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:27,798
On each combat sequence you're
gonna meet a different challenge.

133
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:35,013
We'll teach you to fly the F-14
faster than you've ever flown before.

134
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:41,520
Now, we don't make policy here.
Elected officials, civilians, do that.

135
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:49,444
We are their instruments and must
always act as though we are at war.

136
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:54,825
- What are you doing?
- Just wondering who's the best.

137
00:17:55,075 --> 00:18:00,163
In case some of you wonder
who the best is, they're on this plaque.

138
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:05,377
The best driver and his RIO
from each class has his name on it.

139
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:11,341
They have the option to come back here
and be Top Gun instructors.

140
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:16,930
- You think you will be on the plaque?
- Yes, sir.

141
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:22,019
That's pretty arrogant,
considering the company you're in.

142
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:28,275
- Yes, sir.
- I like that in a pilot.

143
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:35,365
Remember, when it's over out there,
we're all on the same team.

144
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:43,123
This school is about combat.
There are no points for second place.

145
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:47,002
- Dismissed.
- Nice going.

146
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:54,468
The plaque for the alternates
is down in the ladies' room.

147
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:58,847
Jesus ... You kill me.

148
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:03,143
You really do ...
There's two O's in Goose, boys.

149
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:23,956
- This I call a target-rich environment.
- You live your life between your legs.

150
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:27,209
Even you could get laid in here.

151
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:30,963
I'd be happy to find a girl
who'd talk dirty to me.

152
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:39,638
You wanted to know who the best is?
That's him. Iceman.

153
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,934
He flies ice-cold. No mistakes.

154
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:50,023
Wears you down. You get bored,
do something stupid, and he's got you.

155
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:57,656
- I thought you wanted to be a pilot.
- Whose butt did you kiss to get here?

156
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:01,493
- The list is long but distinguished.
- So is myjohnson.

157
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:06,206
- So you're flying with lceman?
- Hey, Mother Goose, how's it going?

158
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:10,544
Tom, this is Pete Mitchell.
Tom Kazansky.

159
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:16,800
Congratulations on Top Gun. Sorry to
hear about Cougar. He was a good man.

160
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:21,847
- Still is a good man.
- Yeah, that's what I meant.

161
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:28,061
You need any help?
You figured it out yet?

162
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:33,233
- What's that?
- Who's the best pilot.

163
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:37,988
- I can figure that one out on my own.
- I heard that about you.

164
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:42,242
You like to work alone.

165
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:46,997
You're lucky. First the MiG
and then you slide into Cougar's spot.

166
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,791
We didn't slide into Cougar's spot.

167
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:55,130
Some pilots wait a whole career to see
a MiG up close. Lucky and famous?

168
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:01,970
- You mean notorious. See you later.
- You can count on it.

169
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:07,643
- They were abused children.
- We're gonna have a good time.

170
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:17,361
Okay, I guess it's my turn, isn't it?
All right, the bet is 20 dollars.

171
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:23,116
You have to have carnal knowledge,
of a lady this time, on the premises.

172
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:27,538
- On the premises.
- Come on, a bet's a bet.

173
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:33,836
I don't know, it just doesn't seem fair ...
for you, I mean. But ...

174
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:37,464
She's lost that loving feeling.

175
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:40,968
No, she hasn't. She has not lost ...

176
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:45,389
- She's lost it, man. Come on.
- I hate it when she does that.

177
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:56,233
- Excuse me, miss.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of this.

178
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:49,036
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

179
00:22:56,668 --> 00:23:03,300
I love that song. That's a new approach.
How long have you been doing this act?

180
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:07,596
- I don't know. Since ...
- Puberty?.

181
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:11,266
- I'm Charlotte Blackwood.
- I'm Maverick.

182
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:17,105
- Did your mother not like you?
- No, it's my call sign.

183
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:22,194
- You're a pilot?
- That's right. A naval aviator.

184
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:27,616
- Actually, we've only done this twice.
- How did you do?

185
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:32,579
- Crashed and burned on the first one.
- And the second?

186
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:37,584
I'll tell you tomorrow.
But it's looking good so far.

187
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:46,844
Well, Maverick. My friend just arrived,
so it's been great talking to you. Perry.

188
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:51,056
I'll be with you in just a second.

189
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:58,647
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- That depends.

190
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:04,903
- Are you a good pilot?
- I can hold my own.

191
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:11,952
Great. Then I won't have to worry about
you making your living as a singer.

192
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:24,423
I'm gonna need a beer to put these
flames out. Great, Mav. Real slick.

193
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:52,659
- A long cruise, was it, sailor?.
- Too long.

194
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:56,705
You want to just drop down on the tile
and go for it?

195
00:24:56,955 --> 00:25:00,751
I actually had this counter in mind.

196
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:06,715
- That would be very comfortable, yeah.
- It could be.

197
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:14,932
I came in here to save you from making
a big mistake with that older guy.

198
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:21,647
Really?. So I could go on to a bigger one
with a young guy like yourself?

199
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:25,150
Maybe.

200
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:30,989
- I have to get up early in the morning.
- What are you doing?

201
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:36,954
Your friend was magnificent.

202
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:46,922
You'll also be trained and evaluated
by civilian specialists.

203
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:51,969
They are our best source of information
on enemy aircraft.

204
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:57,850
One of the most qualified is call sign
Charlie, with a Ph.D. in astrophysics.

205
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:05,065
Listen to her, because the Pentagon
listens to her about your proficiency.

206
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:08,777
All yours, Charlie.

207
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:15,325
Hello. We will be dealing with F-5s
and A-4s as our MiG simulators.

208
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:21,540
As you know, the F-5 doesn't have
the thrust-to-weight ratio of the MiG-28.

209
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:26,420
And it doesn't bleed energy
below 300 knots like the MiG-28.

210
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:32,301
However, the MiG-28 does have
a problem with its inverted flight tanks.

211
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:35,721
It won't do a negative G push-over.

212
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:41,518
The latest intelligence tells us
the most it will do is ...

213
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:45,314
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Is there something wrong?

214
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:50,944
- The data on the MiG is inaccurate.
- How's that?

215
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:56,158
Well, I just happened to see a MiG-28 ...
Sorry, Goose.

216
00:26:56,408 --> 00:27:02,164
We happened to see a MiG-28
do a four G negative dive.

217
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:05,083
Where did you see this?

218
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:11,507
That's classified. I could tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

219
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:14,718
I have Top Secret clearance.

220
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:19,431
The Pentagon sees to it
that I know more than you.

221
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:27,689
- Well, it doesn't seem to be the case.
- So, where exactly were you?

222
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:34,655
We started up on his six when he pulled
through the clouds. I went above him.

223
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:39,159
If you were directly above him,
how could you see him?

224
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:43,121
- Because I was inverted.
- Bullshit.

225
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:46,792
No, he was, man.
It was a really great move.

226
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:52,256
You were in a four G inverted dive
with a MiG-28?

227
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:55,425
- Yes, ma'am.
- At what range?

228
00:27:55,676 --> 00:28:01,473
- About two metres?
- 11/2. I have a great Polaroid of it.

229
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:05,227
- It was a nice picture.
- Lieutenant?

230
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:12,609
- What were you doing there?
- Communicating.

231
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:16,446
Keeping up foreign relations.

232
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:21,118
- I was, you know, giving him the bird.
- You know, the finger.

233
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:26,540
- I know the finger.
- I hate it when it does that. I'm sorry.

234
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:30,544
- Excuse me.
- So you're the one?

235
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:35,549
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right, we have a hop to take.

236
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:41,221
The hard-deck on this is 10,000 feet.
There'll be no engagement below that.

237
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:43,182
Move it!

238
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:50,898
Lieutenant!

239
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:55,986
Don't be late again.
You look great, honey.

240
00:28:56,236 --> 00:29:00,574
Why didn't you tell me
you were the famous MiG lnsulter?.

241
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:05,954
- Would it have made any difference?
- Not in the ladies' room.

242
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:13,128
I see 20 new hotshots every eight
weeks. I'm sure you can figure that out.

243
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:19,635
I'd just really like
to hear about the MiG sometime.

244
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:25,015
You've got security clearance.
You can read about it.

245
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:34,691
Maverick?.
I'm curious.

246
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:41,907
Who was covering Cougar while you
were showboating with his MiG?

247
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:44,243
Cougar was doing just fine.

248
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:51,667
This is your fiirsthop. Thejets you're
flying against are smaller and faster, -

249
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:56,880
-justlike the enemy MiGs.
As ofnow we are keeping score.

250
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:01,510
- I lost him, Goose.
- Show me what you've got, kid.

251
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:06,223
- I lost him.
- I'm looking.

252
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:12,062
- He's on our tail, coming hard.
- I got him. Here we go.

253
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:29,955
- Talk to me, Goose.
- He's still back there. Closing in on us.

254
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:34,668
You can run, kid, but you can't hide.

255
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:41,592
All right, Jester,
I'll give you a run for your money here.

256
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:48,265
Watch the mountains!

257
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:03,197
He's still back there. Come on, Mav,
do some of that pilot shit.

258
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:18,045
- Come on, bring it right.
- I've had about enough of this shit.

259
00:31:20,297 --> 00:31:23,342
- I'll hit the brakes, he'll fly right by.
- You're mine.

260
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:33,060
Jesus Christ!

261
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:40,484
- Let's see what you've got now, Jester.
- Let's turn and burn.

262
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:03,298
- He's going vertical. So am l.
- We're going ballistic. Go get him!

263
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:15,978
He's going for the hard-deck.
Let's nail him.

264
00:32:16,228 --> 00:32:20,482
No way, Jester. You're mine.

265
00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:36,748
I've got you now!

266
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:44,173
- Jester's dead.
- Jester's dead.

267
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:50,137
Get your butts above the hard-deck
and return to base.

268
00:32:53,015 --> 00:32:56,185
Yes, sir!

269
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:07,237
- This is Ghost Rider requesting a fly-by.
- Negative. The pattern is full.

270
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:12,868
- No, Mav. This is not a good idea.
- Sorry, but it's time to buzz the tower.

271
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:27,174
Goddamn son of a bitch!

272
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:33,222
Great balls of fire.

273
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,020
- Jester's dead.
- You won? Bullshit.

274
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:45,901
- Didn't everybody?.
- We got our butts kicked.

275
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:51,073
I said to Hollywood, "Where did he go?"
He said, "Where did who go?"

276
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:56,411
- And he's laughing at us on the radio.
- That was me, dickhead. We won.

277
00:33:56,662 --> 00:34:01,166
- All right!
- They won too, man.

278
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:05,087
- That's not what I heard.
- We got Jester.

279
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:09,466
- Below the hard-deck doesn't count.
- We nailed that son of a bitch.

280
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:14,805
- You guys really are cowboys.
- What's your problem, Kazansky?.

281
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:19,268
You're everyone's problem.
Every time you fly, you're unsafe.

282
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:25,315
- I don't like you. You're dangerous.
- That's right, lceman.

283
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:29,236
I am dangerous.

284
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:35,409
Maverick?. You and Goose
get your butts up to Viper's office, now!

285
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:43,667
Remember, no points for second place.

286
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:48,338
- You're a lot brighter than you look.
- You shut up.

287
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:56,430
Two of your snot-nosed jockeys flew by
by at over 400 knots. I want their butts!

288
00:34:58,307 --> 00:35:03,103
Damn it, that's twice.
I want some butts!

289
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:09,359
- That just about covers the fly-bys.
- Follow me.

290
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:18,994
Gentlemen. You had a hell of a first day.

291
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:28,128
The hard-deck for this hop was
10,000 feet. You knew it. You broke it.

292
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:35,677
You followed Commander Heatherly
below after he lost sight of you. Why?.

293
00:35:35,928 --> 00:35:42,434
Sir, I had him in my sights.
He saw me move in for the kill.

294
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:49,441
He proceeded below the hard-deck.
We were below forjust a few seconds.

295
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:53,320
I had the shot.
There was no danger, so I took it.

296
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:59,535
You took it,
and broke a major rule of engagement.

297
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:05,707
Then you broke another one
with that circus stunt fly-by.

298
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:10,879
Top Gun rules of engagement exist
for your safety and for that of your team.

299
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:17,678
They're not flexible, nor am l. Obey them
or you're history. Is that clear?.

300
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:23,058
Yes, sir!

301
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:32,734
Dismissed.

302
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:42,286
I really enjoyed that, Mav,
thanks a lot. Holy shit.

303
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:52,921
Maybe I could be a truck driver. You got
the number of that truck-driving school?

304
00:36:53,172 --> 00:36:58,093
Fitness report says it all.
He's a wild card.

305
00:36:58,343 --> 00:37:02,139
Completely unpredictable.

306
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:06,518
- He got you, didn't he?
- Yeah.

307
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:11,607
Maverick. I flew with his old man.

308
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:22,242
Tell me, if you had to go into battle,
would you want him with you?

309
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:26,246
I just don't know.

310
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:39,510
- Still awake?
- Yeah.

311
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:45,599
- What's up?
- I can't sleep.

312
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:54,358
When I realised we were off to Top Gun,
all I could think about was that trophy.

313
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:59,821
I've got to be straight with you, Mav.
Right now, I just hope we graduate.

314
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:07,412
I got a family to think about.
I can't afford to blow this.

315
00:38:09,665 --> 00:38:14,086
I guess that fly-by
wasn't such a big hit, huh?

316
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:22,678
I know it's tough. The Academy rejected
you because you're Duke Mitchell's kid.

317
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:31,061
You have to live with that reputation.
But it's like you're flying against a ghost.

318
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:35,524
It makes me nervous.

319
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:44,783
You're the only family I've got.
I'm not gonna let you down. I promise.

320
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:57,963
Get out of here.

321
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:17,065
A rolling reversal
would work well in that situation.

322
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:20,819
If I reversed on a hard cross,
I could go to guns on him.

323
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:26,116
But at that speed, it's too fast.
It's a little bit too aggressive.

324
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:30,787
Too aggressive?

325
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:36,126
I guess when I see something,
I go right after it.

326
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:42,257
- You didn't tell me who you were.
- I didn't get a chance. You deserved it.

327
00:39:43,926 --> 00:39:51,975
I know ... but you were tempted
to ask me out for dinner.

328
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:56,855
No. I don't date students.

329
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:12,788
I can see it's dangerous for you.
But if the government trusts me ...

330
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:16,875
... maybe you could.

331
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:26,093
It takes a lot more than just fancy flying.

332
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:42,776
Crash and burn, huh, Mav?.

333
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:47,197
Slider ...

334
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:52,035
You stink.

335
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:02,796
Let's go!

336
00:41:03,066 --> 00:41:06,399

00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:27,297
Come on, Mav. Just one more game.
That evens it up.

358
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:31,927
- I got some things to take care of.
- Just one more game.

359
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:36,598
Please? For me?
Come on ... For me?

360
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:14,386
Damn it.

361
00:43:24,813 --> 00:43:27,691
Lieutenant?

362
00:43:32,154 --> 00:43:36,950
- What? No singing?
- Look, I'm ...

363
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:40,913
No apologies.

364
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:52,007
If you don't mind, I'll just take a quick
shower while you're finishing up here.

365
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:58,722
I do mind. I'm hungry.

366
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:05,562
And then I thought about it.

367
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:10,275
I thought,
"You know, he's a smart guy."

368
00:44:10,526 --> 00:44:16,448
"Why don't you just tell him
why you've got him here?"

369
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:21,703
It's the MiG.

370
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:30,712
The MiG. You're the only pilot
who's been up against a MiG-28.

371
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:37,636
I'm trying for this big promotion.
If I get it, I won't be here much longer.

372
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:41,849
Seems to me you've got it all figured out.

373
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:48,856
Except you did forget the wine.

374
00:44:49,106 --> 00:44:51,400
Sorry.

375
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:57,030
- You always get what you want?
- No, not always. Yeah, maybe.

376
00:44:57,281 --> 00:45:01,743
Then relax about the MiG.

377
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,594
This music ...

378
00:45:18,844 --> 00:45:22,222
An old friend?

379
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:28,395
My folks loved it.
I haven't heard this in years.

380
00:45:28,645 --> 00:45:33,692
My mother used to call from her room
and have me play this over and over.

381
00:45:33,942 --> 00:45:38,363
I got so sick of it.

382
00:45:38,614 --> 00:45:45,120
But not her. She'd sit up there alone,
just listening for hours.

383
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:51,877
Just listening.
She died shortly after him.

384
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:56,590
What happened to your father?.

385
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:06,808
I figured with your security clearance
you'd know more about it than I do.

386
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:12,397
Well, I didn't get that far.

387
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:15,859
It's a big mystery.

388
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:20,822
He disappeared in an F-4,
November 5th, 1965.

389
00:46:23,408 --> 00:46:28,664
The stink of it was ... he screwed up.

390
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:34,294
No way.
My old man was a great fighter pilot.

391
00:46:37,172 --> 00:46:42,928
But who the hell knows?
It's all classified.

392
00:46:43,178 --> 00:46:47,683
- Somebody must know.
- Yeah, somebody knows everything.

393
00:46:47,933 --> 00:46:53,021
Is that why
you're always second best up there?

394
00:46:53,272 --> 00:46:57,568
You are direct, aren't you.

395
00:47:03,824 --> 00:47:07,870
I'm sorry I was late.

396
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:14,084
- I'm sorry for being direct.
- No apologies.

397
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:19,756
This is going to be complicated.

398
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:33,729
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna take a shower.

399
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:43,155
Thank you. I enjoyed being here.

400
00:48:20,234 --> 00:48:25,113
It looks like you need another shower.

401
00:48:25,364 --> 00:48:28,784
Right.

402
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:36,166
I'm gonna be honest with you.

403
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:41,505
Your MiG sighting
is really important to my work, but ...

404
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:50,639
I don't normally invite students
to my house. You're ...

405
00:48:58,897 --> 00:49:02,442
But please understand,
I still have a job to do.

406
00:49:28,552 --> 00:49:34,016
I'm glad we got that straight.

407
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:54,369
I told her how tough it is here.
My ass dragging like an old tired dog.

408
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:57,915
I told her you didn't even have a woman.

409
00:49:58,165 --> 00:50:01,877
She said, "He probably
doesn't have one, but eight."

410
00:50:06,882 --> 00:50:12,429
- Hi!
- Daddy.

411
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:23,941
Goose tells me you're in love
with one of your instructors.

412
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:29,279
I didn't tell her that. I can't believe
you said that. That was a secret.

413
00:50:36,954 --> 00:50:42,334
The bogey has good position right here.
Freeze frame. A moment of choice.

414
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:46,880
The F-14 is defensive.
He has a chance to bug out right here.

415
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:53,595
Better to retire and save your aircraft
than push a bad position.

416
00:50:53,846 --> 00:50:59,059
Charlie, jump in here any time. You stay
in that diamond another three seconds, -

417
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:04,106
- the bogey's gonna blow you away.
You take a hard right, select zone five ...

418
00:51:04,356 --> 00:51:09,278
You can extend an escape.
You made a bad choice.

419
00:51:09,528 --> 00:51:16,702
- Charlie?
- Aircraft one performs a split S?

420
00:51:16,952 --> 00:51:21,123
That's the last thing you should do.
The MiG's right on your tail.

421
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:27,963
Freeze there. The MiG has you in
his gunsight. What were you thinking?

422
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:32,718
You don't have time to think up there.
If you think, you're dead.

423
00:51:32,968 --> 00:51:38,724
That's a big gamble
with a $30 million plane.

424
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:49,234
Unfortunately, it worked.
The MiG never got a clean shot.

425
00:51:49,484 --> 00:51:56,074
Maverick makes an aggressive vertical
move and defeats him with a missile.

426
00:51:56,325 --> 00:52:01,705
The encounter was a victory, but we
show it as an example of what not to do.

427
00:52:03,707 --> 00:52:06,001
Next.

428
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:09,713
Gutsiest move I ever saw, man.

429
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:17,513
Now then, this is a perfect example
of a textbook manoeuvre.

430
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:31,318
Lieutenant?

431
00:52:44,206 --> 00:52:49,169
My review of your performance was
right on, in my professional opinion.

432
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:53,215
I can't hear you.

433
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:17,990
Jesus! And you call me reckless? When
I fly, my crew and my plane come first.

434
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:24,621
I'm gonna finish my sentence. My review
of your performance was right on.

435
00:53:24,872 --> 00:53:30,502
I see some real genius in your flying,
but I can't say that in there.

436
00:53:30,752 --> 00:53:34,590
I was afraid they'd see right through me.

437
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:40,345
I don't want anyone to know
that I've fallen for you.

438
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:08,024

Watchin' every motion...</i>

439
00:54:08,064 --> 00:54:11,864
<i>in this foolish lovers' game.</i>

440
00:54:15,805 --> 00:54:18,000
<i>Haunted by the notion...</i>

441
00:54:18,041 --> 00:54:23,001
<i>somewhere there's a love
in flames.</i>

442
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:28,010
<i>Turning and returning...</i>

443
00:54:28,051 --> 00:54:33,648
<i>to some secret place inside.</i>

444
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:38,327
<i>Watching in slow motion...</i>

445
00:54:38,361 --> 00:54:42,764
<i>as you turn my way...</i>

446
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,528
<i>and say...</i>

447
00:54:44,567 --> 00:54:48,526
<i>''Take my breath away...''</i>

448
00:54:52,609 --> 00:54:54,668
<i>''my love.''</i>

449
00:54:54,711 --> 00:54:58,647
<i>''Take my breath away...''</i>

450
00:55:02,452 --> 00:55:04,647
<i>''my love.''</i>

451
00:55:04,688 --> 00:55:11,218
<i>''Take my breath away,
my love.''</i>

452
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:28,996
- Hey, Maverick?. Hear about lce?
- What's that?

453
00:55:29,246 --> 00:55:33,375
- He won another one.
- Really?.

454
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:38,881
I fell the need ...
the need for speed.

455
00:55:42,134 --> 00:55:47,890
This is hop 19. Multiple aircraft, multiple
bogeys. Your training is halfover.

456
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:52,686
The competltion for the trophy
remains tight. Firstplace, lceman.

457
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:56,190
Second, Maverick, two points behind.

458
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,943
There they are. Three miles, 10 o'clock.

459
00:56:00,194 --> 00:56:05,324
I see them. Two A-4s.
Left 10 o'clock level. Continue left turn.

460
00:56:14,124 --> 00:56:21,840
- Good morning. The temperature is 1 10.
- Viper's up here? Great. Oh, shit.

461
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:27,262
He's probably saying,
"Holy shit, it's Maverick and Goose."

462
00:56:31,433 --> 00:56:37,105
- I've got my eye on the northern bogey.
- Roger, I've got the southern guy.

463
00:56:37,356 --> 00:56:41,318
Hollywood, you lead. I'll cover you.

464
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,373
Break now, Jester.

465
00:56:58,418 --> 00:57:01,547
We're losing Viper.
Let's just stay on Jester.

466
00:57:06,051 --> 00:57:13,308
- Goose, find Viper. He's out there.
- Stay with Hollywood.

467
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:18,272
- There's Viper. Three o'clock low.
- We're Hollywood's cover.

468
00:57:18,522 --> 00:57:22,568
- Don't you leave me.
- Hollywood, you're looking good.

469
00:57:22,818 --> 00:57:24,903
I'm going after Viper.

470
00:57:27,531 --> 00:57:30,492
- Goddamn you!
- Don't leave him.

471
00:57:30,742 --> 00:57:34,663
Hollywood's okay. I want Viper.

472
00:57:37,165 --> 00:57:39,877
Viper's coming down.

473
00:57:46,175 --> 00:57:49,595
Holy shit. We're head-to-head.

474
00:58:03,734 --> 00:58:07,112
Rock and roll! Here's our big chance.

475
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:12,910
Come on, goddamn it.

476
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,915
Come on, keep coming.

477
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:25,005
Okay, sidewinder missile selected.
Come on, baby.

478
00:58:25,255 --> 00:58:27,758
Come around. That's it.

479
00:58:33,764 --> 00:58:41,396
- Jesus, he's good. Where's he going?
- Come on, come on. Keep coming.

480
00:58:44,316 --> 00:58:47,819
Come on, baby.

481
00:58:51,073 --> 00:58:53,867
Damn, this kid's good.

482
00:58:54,117 --> 00:58:57,704
He's too close for missiles.
I'm switching to guns.

483
00:58:59,957 --> 00:59:03,293
Come on, come on.

484
00:59:04,253 --> 00:59:07,047
Stick with it ...

485
00:59:10,008 --> 00:59:14,054
- Hold it. Check our tail.
- Shit, there's Jester!

486
00:59:14,304 --> 00:59:19,184
Bingo, Maverick's dead.
You're out of there, kid.

487
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:26,483
The Defence Department regrets to
inform you your sons died of stupidity.

488
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:30,696
Knock it off, gentlemen.
Let's go home. Viper has the lead.

489
00:59:37,452 --> 00:59:41,582
- 30 seconds, Wolfman. I'm coming in.
- Shut up!

490
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:47,504
That was some of the best flying
I've seen yet. Until you got killed.

491
00:59:47,754 --> 00:59:52,426
You never, never leave your wingman.

492
00:59:57,472 --> 01:00:03,270
Maverick ... It's not your flying,
it's your attitude.

493
01:00:04,646 --> 01:00:11,987
The enemy's dangerous, but right now
you're worse. Dangerous and foolish.

494
01:00:12,237 --> 01:00:19,286
You may not like who's flying with you,
but whose side are you on?

495
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:33,550
At least Viper got lceman before
he got us. We've still got a shot at it.

496
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:39,890
That was stupid, I know better than that.
That will never happen again.

497
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:46,021
I know ...

498
01:00:49,399 --> 01:00:53,070
I know.

499
01:01:28,824 --> 01:01:32,055
<i>You shake my nerves,
and you rattle my brain.</i>

500
01:01:32,094 --> 01:01:34,961
<i>Thinkin' 'bout your love
drives a man insane.</i>

501
01:01:34,997 --> 01:01:36,624
<i>You break my wiII.</i>

502
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:37,894
<i>Oh, what a thrill.</i>

503
01:01:37,933 --> 01:01:40,993
<i>Goodness, gracious,
great balls of fire.</i>

504
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:45,497
Go fetch him.
Doesn't he ever embarrass you?

505
01:01:45,747 --> 01:01:51,753
- Hell no. Well, there was the time ...
- Admiral's daughter.

506
01:01:52,004 --> 01:01:57,259
He told me all about the time
you went ballistic with Penny Benjamin.

507
01:01:57,509 --> 01:02:00,012
Did he? Great.

508
01:02:00,262 --> 01:02:05,726
He tells me about all of them. My angel
Goose goes home early for church.

509
01:02:05,976 --> 01:02:10,272
- You go home with the hot women.
- Thank you, Carole.

510
01:02:10,522 --> 01:02:15,861
I'm gonna go embarrass myself
with Goose for a while.

511
01:02:19,308 --> 01:02:22,436
BOTH: You shake my nerves,
and you rattle my brain.

512
01:02:22,478 --> 01:02:25,447
Thinkin' 'bout your love
drives a man insane.

513
01:02:25,481 --> 01:02:26,812
You broke my will.

514
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:28,214
Oh, what a thrill.

515
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:31,276
Goodness, gracious,
great balls of fire.

516
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:37,132
I'd love to be able to warn you off about
Maverick, but I just love him to death.

517
01:02:38,634 --> 01:02:43,639
I've known Pete for a lot of years.
One thing's for certain.

518
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:48,977
There are hearts breaking wide open
all over the world tonight.

519
01:02:49,228 --> 01:02:53,607
Unless you are a fool,
that boy is off the market.

520
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:59,196
He is 100%%% prime time in love with you.

521
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:05,077
Hey, Goose, you big stud.
Take me to bed or lose me forever.

522
01:03:05,327 --> 01:03:08,956
Show me the way home, honey.

523
01:03:09,206 --> 01:03:12,334
Come on, brother, sing with the family.

524
01:03:15,131 --> 01:03:17,827
<i>You shake my nerves,
and you rattle my brain.</i>

525
01:03:17,867 --> 01:03:20,859
<i>Thinkin' 'bout your love

526
01:03:20,903 --> 01:03:22,336
<i>You broke my will.</i>

527
01:03:22,371 --> 01:03:23,895
<i>Oh, what a thrill.</i>

528
01:03:23,939 --> 01:03:26,874
<i>Goodness, gracious,
great balls of fire.</i>

529
01:03:43,824 --> 01:03:48,662
Maverick, you big stud ...

530
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:53,250
Take me to bed or lose me forever.

531
01:04:05,512 --> 01:04:08,932
This is hop 31.
Two weeks to graduation.

532
01:04:09,183 --> 01:04:12,519
The Top Gun trophy
is still up forgrabs.

533
01:04:30,832 --> 01:04:32,459
<i>KENNY LOGGINS SINGING:
Revvin' up your engine.</i>

534
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,094
<i>Listen to her howl and roar.</i>

535
01:04:37,005 --> 01:04:38,529
<i>Metal under tension...</i>

<i>Highway to the danger zone.</i>

538
01:04:49,417 --> 01:04:55,947
<i>Ride into the danger zone.</i>

539
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:59,566
The score is tied. Time for the big one.

540
01:04:59,816 --> 01:05:05,906
- Are you up for this one, Maverick?.
- Just a walk in the park.

541
01:05:07,824 --> 01:05:12,496
Contact. Multiple bogeys. Two miles.
Looks like they're going away from us.

542
01:05:12,746 --> 01:05:16,667
- I see them. Right, two o'clock. I'm in.
- I'm in.

543
01:05:36,812 --> 01:05:40,440
That son of a bitch cut me off.

544
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:53,203
Come on. Jesus Christ, lce.
Take the shot. Get the hell out of there.

545
01:05:53,453 --> 01:05:57,207
I can't get the angle. I'm too close.
I'm switching to guns.

546
01:05:57,457 --> 01:06:00,586
Fire or clear!

547
01:06:05,215 --> 01:06:11,221
- Christ, I can take a shot right here.
- 20 seconds and I've got him.

548
01:06:17,186 --> 01:06:21,273
- I'm moving in. I've got the shot.
- Come on, Mav.

549
01:06:23,025 --> 01:06:26,612
- He's getting impatient. Take the shot.
- 10 more seconds.

550
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:33,452
Get the hell out of there.
Come off my right. I'm in.

551
01:06:33,702 --> 01:06:36,622
- Five more seconds.
- I'm in.

552
01:06:36,872 --> 01:06:38,999
I'm off. Shit.

553
01:06:41,627 --> 01:06:44,296
We're in a jetwash. Shit!

554
01:06:47,466 --> 01:06:53,263
This is not good. We've got a flame-out.
Engine one is out ... Engine two is out.

555
01:06:53,514 --> 01:06:56,517
I'm losing control. I can't control it!

556
01:07:00,771 --> 01:07:04,566
It's coupling up. This is not good!

557
01:07:04,816 --> 01:07:10,239
Mayday, mayday. Mav's in trouble.
He's in a flat spin heading out to sea!

558
01:07:12,157 --> 01:07:15,702
Altitude 8,000 ... 7,000 ...

559
01:07:15,953 --> 01:07:18,747
We're at 6,000!

560
01:07:20,499 --> 01:07:23,377
I can't reach the ejection handle!

561
01:07:25,546 --> 01:07:32,177
- You're gonna have to punch us out.
- I can't reach the ejection handle!

562
01:07:32,427 --> 01:07:35,931
- Eject ...
- Watch the canopy!

563
01:07:52,531 --> 01:07:54,950
Goose ... Oh, no!

564
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:01,290
Oh, God.

565
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:52,174
Sir, let go of him.
You've got to let him go, sir.

566
01:09:35,634 --> 01:09:41,431
- How are you doing?
- I'm all right.

567
01:09:41,682 --> 01:09:45,727
- Goose is dead.
- I know.

568
01:09:48,856 --> 01:09:53,318
You flyjets long enough,
something like this happens.

569
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:57,906
He was my RIO, my responsibility.

570
01:09:59,992 --> 01:10:05,956
In my squadron in Vietnam,
we lost 8 of 18 aircraft. 10 men.

571
01:10:06,206 --> 01:10:12,462
The first one dies, you die too.
But there will be others.

572
01:10:12,713 --> 01:10:16,216
You can count on it.

573
01:10:16,466 --> 01:10:20,220
You've got to let him go.

574
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:25,142
You've got to let him go.

575
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:45,287
I think maybe it was my fault.

576
01:10:45,537 --> 01:10:48,874
I don't know.

577
01:10:49,124 --> 01:10:53,086
I don't know what the hell went wrong.

578
01:10:53,337 --> 01:10:58,300
I'd like to help. I know it's difficult.

579
01:11:03,889 --> 01:11:08,018
God, I want him back.

580
01:11:12,231 --> 01:11:16,735
I'll be here if you need me, okay?.

581
01:13:08,138 --> 01:13:12,059
God, he loved flying with you, Maverick.

582
01:13:29,243 --> 01:13:34,706
He would have flown anyway ...
without you.

583
01:13:34,957 --> 01:13:40,504
He'd have hated it,
but he would have done it.

584
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:06,113
The spin was induced by the disruption
of air flow into the starboard engine.

585
01:14:06,363 --> 01:14:10,284
This disruption stalled the engine, -

586
01:14:10,534 --> 01:14:14,955
- which produced enough yaw rate
to induce a spin -

587
01:14:15,205 --> 01:14:18,584
- which was unrecoverable.

588
01:14:18,834 --> 01:14:24,381
There was no way Lieutenant Mitchell
could see or avoid the jetwash.

589
01:14:24,631 --> 01:14:29,845
The Board of lnquiry finds that he was
not at fault in the accident of 29 July.

590
01:14:30,095 --> 01:14:36,643
His record will be cleared. He's restored
to flight status without further delay.

591
01:14:37,811 --> 01:14:41,273
These proceedings are closed.

592
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:52,367
Get him up flying, soon.

593
01:15:17,935 --> 01:15:23,690
- Come on, kid. Get in there. Engage.
- You've got a bogey at two o'clock.

594
01:15:28,237 --> 01:15:31,782
Take the shot, kid.

595
01:15:32,032 --> 01:15:35,494
You can engage any time, Maverick.

596
01:15:44,044 --> 01:15:48,715
- Where the hell are you going?
- It doesn't look good.

597
01:15:48,966 --> 01:15:54,304
What do you mean? It doesn't get
to look any better than that.

598
01:16:04,898 --> 01:16:08,944
Hey, man. We could have had him ...

599
01:16:11,154 --> 01:16:16,785
I'll fire when I'm goddamn
good and ready. You got that?

600
01:16:34,636 --> 01:16:39,892
- He won't engage.
- It's only been a few days.

601
01:16:40,142 --> 01:16:46,273
- He just might not make it back.
- Keep sending him up.

602
01:17:06,835 --> 01:17:09,505
Mitchell?

603
01:17:09,713 --> 01:17:14,134
I'm sorry about Goose.

604
01:17:15,511 --> 01:17:18,972
Everybody liked him.

605
01:17:22,976 --> 01:17:26,313
I'm sorry.

606
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:47,960
Hi, it's Wolfman.

607
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:50,128
Maverickjust quit.

608
01:18:13,694 --> 01:18:16,780
Excuse me ...

609
01:18:18,031 --> 01:18:21,034
- May l?
- Please.

610
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:35,382
I'll have what he's having.
Hemlock, is it?

611
01:18:35,632 --> 01:18:40,220
Ice water.

612
01:18:41,972 --> 01:18:46,018
You weren't gonna say goodbye?

613
01:18:46,268 --> 01:18:51,064
I heard you got that job in Washington.
Congratulations.

614
01:18:51,315 --> 01:18:57,946
Thanks. But I wasn't gonna leave
without saying goodbye.

615
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:06,413
- It's good to see you.
- Thanks.

616
01:19:08,081 --> 01:19:14,421
Where are you going?
You don't even have a ticket, do you?

617
01:19:14,671 --> 01:19:21,595
I've seen all the evidence, and it's not
your responsibility. It's not your fault.

618
01:19:22,763 --> 01:19:26,517
You're one of the best pilots in the Navy.

619
01:19:26,767 --> 01:19:31,188
What you do up there ... It's dangerous.

620
01:19:31,438 --> 01:19:36,443
- But you've got to go on.
- You don't understand.

621
01:19:37,569 --> 01:19:42,950
When I first met you,
you were larger than life.

622
01:19:44,868 --> 01:19:47,788
Look at you.

623
01:19:48,038 --> 01:19:53,210
You're not gonna be happy unless you're
going Mach 2 with your hair on fire.

624
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:56,213
No, that's over. It's just over.

625
01:19:56,463 --> 01:20:02,719
To be the best of the best means you
make mistakes and then you go on.

626
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:06,723
You don't think I know that?

627
01:20:06,974 --> 01:20:10,227
I'm here to help.

628
01:20:10,477 --> 01:20:18,360
Look, thank you. If I'd wanted help,
I would have asked for it.

629
01:20:24,616 --> 01:20:28,245
So, I'm too late.

630
01:20:28,495 --> 01:20:32,082
You've already left.

631
01:20:32,332 --> 01:20:39,298
You didn't learn a damn thing, did you?
Except to quit.

632
01:20:40,883 --> 01:20:45,846
You've got that manoeuvre down
real well.

633
01:20:51,393 --> 01:20:54,771
So long, Pete Mitchell.

634
01:21:19,421 --> 01:21:25,552
Hi, Maverick, come on in. How are you?
Sure you're feeling okay?.

635
01:21:25,802 --> 01:21:30,265
- Great.
- Jamie, come on. Can I get you a drink?.

636
01:21:30,516 --> 01:21:35,521
Make yourself comfortable.
Mike will be right down.

637
01:21:54,915 --> 01:22:00,838
I flew with your old man.
VF-51 , the Oriskany.

638
01:22:02,256 --> 01:22:08,762
You're a lot like he was.
Only better ... and worse.

639
01:22:10,806 --> 01:22:14,810
He was a natural heroic son of a bitch.

640
01:22:18,397 --> 01:22:22,317
So he did do it right.

641
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:28,574
Yeah, he did it right.

642
01:22:36,582 --> 01:22:41,670
Is that why you fly the way you do?
Trying to prove something?

643
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:46,842
Yeah, your old man did it right.

644
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:51,221
What I'm about to tell you is classified.
It could end my career.

645
01:22:51,471 --> 01:22:54,641
We were in the worst dogfight ever.

646
01:22:54,892 --> 01:23:00,898
Bogeys like fireflies all over the sky.
His F-4 was hit, -

647
01:23:01,148 --> 01:23:04,109
- he was wounded, but he stayed.

648
01:23:04,359 --> 01:23:10,991
- Saved three planes before he bought it.
- How come I never heard that before?

649
01:23:11,241 --> 01:23:18,248
The battle occurred
over the wrong line on some map.

650
01:23:18,498 --> 01:23:22,127
- So you were there?
- I was there.

651
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:28,675
- What's on your mind?
- My options, sir.

652
01:23:28,926 --> 01:23:33,430
Simple.
You've acquired enough points -

653
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:38,685
- to show up tomorrow and graduate
with your class. Or you could quit.

654
01:23:40,896 --> 01:23:45,108
There'll be no disgrace.
That spin was hell.

655
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:50,030
- So you think I should quit?
- I didn't say that.

656
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:55,369
You feel responsible for Goose.
And you have a confidence problem.

657
01:23:57,287 --> 01:24:00,457
I won't blow sunshine up your ass.

658
01:24:00,707 --> 01:24:05,170
A good pilot is compelled
to evaluate what's happened -

659
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:13,095
- and apply what he's learned. Up there,
we've got to push it. That's ourjob.

660
01:24:16,056 --> 01:24:20,519
It's your option, Lieutenant.
All yours.

661
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:35,492
Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, sir.
Thank you for your time.

662
01:24:35,742 --> 01:24:39,621
No problem. Good luck.

663
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:32,090
- Gentlemen ...
- Where's Maverick?.

664
01:25:32,341 --> 01:25:37,971
- I don't know where he is.
- You know what he's planning to do?

665
01:25:39,139 --> 01:25:43,810
It's got to be hard on the guy though.

666
01:26:13,090 --> 01:26:16,134
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

667
01:26:17,594 --> 01:26:21,306
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mav.

668
01:26:23,892 --> 01:26:29,982
Gentlemen, I hate to break up the party
before it gets out of hand ...

669
01:26:30,232 --> 01:26:35,320
Some of you have to depart
immediately. We have a crisis situation.

670
01:26:35,571 --> 01:26:39,366
Ice, Slider ...
Hollywood, Wolfman.

671
01:26:41,702 --> 01:26:46,707
- Maverick.
- Sir.

672
01:26:48,125 --> 01:26:53,630
Maverick, you'll get your RIO
when you get to the ship. If you don't ...

673
01:26:53,881 --> 01:26:58,135
... give me a call. I'll fly with you.

674
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:17,529
The SS Layton has become disabled
and has wandered into foreign territory.

675
01:27:17,779 --> 01:27:23,535
A rescue operation will soon begin.
Your mission is to give it air support.

676
01:27:23,785 --> 01:27:30,584
There are MiGs in the area. If you
witness a hostile act, return fire.

677
01:27:31,752 --> 01:27:37,132
They carry the Exocet anti-ship missile.
They can fire it from 100 miles away.

678
01:27:37,382 --> 01:27:43,597
This is the real thing.
This is what you've been trained for.

679
01:27:43,847 --> 01:27:48,894
Make us proud.
Ice ... Hollywood, sector two.

680
01:27:49,144 --> 01:27:53,190
Maverick, you back them up with Merlin
on ready five.

681
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,735
- Yes, sir.
- Rise.

682
01:27:58,779 --> 01:28:01,740
Excuse me, sir. This is not personal.

683
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:08,038
- But is Maverick the best pilot to ..?
- I know what's on your mind. Get on it.

684
01:29:27,034 --> 01:29:30,412
You've got a pair of bogeys,
12 o'clock, 15 miles.

685
01:29:30,662 --> 01:29:36,376
Voodoo One, 090, radar contact
15 miles. They're doing 500 knots.

686
01:29:36,627 --> 01:29:39,296
Roger, that's your bogey.

687
01:29:41,423 --> 01:29:44,134
Dead ahead, 15 miles, 600 knots.

688
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:57,064
They're at 15,000 feetnow, 10 miles.

689
01:29:57,314 --> 01:30:01,527
800 knots. Dead ahead now, eight miles.

690
01:30:01,777 --> 01:30:06,156
Wood, you got them? They must
be close. I'm getting a hard-on.

691
01:30:13,497 --> 01:30:20,629
- I'm taking the lead. Let's identify them.
- Roger. I'm on your leftside, a little low.

692
01:30:20,879 --> 01:30:23,757
Maverick's up and ready in alert five.

693
01:30:26,635 --> 01:30:31,056
Mybogey's still locked up.
He's drifting to the left.

694
01:30:31,306 --> 01:30:37,813
- Stillmanoeuvring, course 090.
- Let's bring It to the right.

695
01:30:47,281 --> 01:30:52,786
Ice, we've got a problem. I have four
aircraft on radar. Four bogeys.

696
01:30:53,036 --> 01:30:55,831
Wood, we've got four bogeys.

697
01:30:57,541 --> 01:31:01,628
- Wrong, make that five!
- There's five, sir.

698
01:31:03,839 --> 01:31:07,009
- Oh, shit!
- He's got a radar lock on us.

699
01:31:09,511 --> 01:31:12,014
Get out of there, Hollywood!

700
01:31:21,106 --> 01:31:26,445
I'm hit. We're coming apart.
I can't control it! We're going down.

701
01:31:26,695 --> 01:31:29,615
Wood's been hit. Wood's been hit!

702
01:31:29,865 --> 01:31:33,118
Voodoo One, Wood's been hit.
We've lost Hollywood!

703
01:31:33,368 --> 01:31:36,538
- We've lostHollywood.
- Launch Maverick.

704
01:31:36,788 --> 01:31:41,835
Get a bearing on Hollywood and
Wolfman. Launch the rescue helicopter.

705
01:32:07,653 --> 01:32:12,157
- Iceman, what's your position?
- 090 at 180 miles.

706
01:32:12,407 --> 01:32:16,995
- They're coming in left.
- Three MiGs dead ahead.

707
01:32:19,164 --> 01:32:23,877
I'm going after them.
I'm bringing it around to the left.

708
01:32:24,127 --> 01:32:28,549
We have four on our tail.
That makes six of them!

709
01:32:33,804 --> 01:32:38,976
- He's firing. Break right.
- This is Voodoo One. We are defensive.

710
01:32:39,226 --> 01:32:43,772
- Launch the alertfiighters!
- 160 miles and closing in fast, sir.

711
01:32:44,022 --> 01:32:45,691
Ready Willard and Simkin.

712
01:32:48,819 --> 01:32:54,449
- I'll be there in 30 seconds.
- I'm engaged with five. I'm in deep shit.

713
01:32:57,244 --> 01:33:02,207
- Willard and Simkin?
- We can't launch any aircraft yet, sir.

714
01:33:02,457 --> 01:33:06,920
How long? 10 minutes?
It's over in two minutes!

715
01:33:09,631 --> 01:33:13,552
One MiG 12 o'clock high ...
Watch your back!

716
01:33:19,558 --> 01:33:24,146
- Break right!
- Shit, that was close.

717
01:33:24,396 --> 01:33:27,941
- Maverick, getyourbutt down here!
- Hang in there.

718
01:33:30,194 --> 01:33:33,697
Jesus Christ!

719
01:33:33,947 --> 01:33:38,035
How about some help? Engage!

720
01:33:38,285 --> 01:33:42,122
We've got a MiG on our tail.

721
01:33:42,372 --> 01:33:45,709
Watch out!

722
01:33:47,169 --> 01:33:51,423
We just flew right through his jetwash!

723
01:33:51,673 --> 01:33:54,468
Get control!

724
01:34:01,016 --> 01:34:06,605
- Good recovery.
- Let's get in there and help lce.

725
01:34:06,855 --> 01:34:11,610
- Let's get back in the game.
- No, it's no good.

726
01:34:14,655 --> 01:34:19,743
- Goddamn it. Maverick's disengaging.
- I knew it. Shit!

727
01:34:22,996 --> 01:34:28,460
Get in there, come on.
What the hell are you doing?

728
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:34,550
- Ice won't last down there alone ...
- Talk to me, Goose.

729
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:38,345
Maverick!

730
01:34:40,347 --> 01:34:42,933
Maverick's re-engaging, sir.

731
01:34:47,813 --> 01:34:52,317
- I can't get him off my tail.
- I've got your MiG dead ahead.

732
01:34:53,902 --> 01:34:57,614
I got tone. Firing!

733
01:35:08,208 --> 01:35:11,461
- Where are they?.
- 155 miles.

734
01:35:11,712 --> 01:35:17,050
- Two MiGs dead ahead.
- I see them. I'll take it left.

735
01:35:18,969 --> 01:35:22,598
Oh, my God.

736
01:35:22,848 --> 01:35:27,561
Ice is right below with a MiG on his tail.

737
01:35:27,811 --> 01:35:30,480
He's firing. Break left!

738
01:35:32,774 --> 01:35:35,652
He overshot!

739
01:35:35,903 --> 01:35:41,325
Coming in, lce.
I got two MiGs, dead ahead.

740
01:35:43,202 --> 01:35:45,913
One MiG passing between us.

741
01:35:49,249 --> 01:35:53,045
You've got a MiG on your left.
He's gonna fire!

742
01:36:01,053 --> 01:36:04,097
Check the guy to the north!

743
01:36:06,475 --> 01:36:09,603
Banking left.

744
01:36:10,938 --> 01:36:16,443
- There he is. Get him, lce!
- Okay, you guys, I'm coming in.

745
01:36:19,863 --> 01:36:23,951
- A MiG's coming round on our tail.
- I can't leave lce.

746
01:36:24,201 --> 01:36:28,956
- He's gonna get behind us!
- I'm not leaving my wingman.

747
01:36:31,834 --> 01:36:36,755
I'm on his tail. I'm going
for the shot right now. Roger, engaged!

748
01:36:39,883 --> 01:36:44,263
- I've got radar lock.
- I'm taking the shot. Fire!

749
01:36:49,142 --> 01:36:52,646
- Bingo!
- Watch out, there's a MiG to your right.

750
01:36:52,896 --> 01:36:55,649
He's firing!

751
01:36:55,899 --> 01:37:02,114
- I'm hit. We're hit in the right engine.
- I'm shutting it down.

752
01:37:07,077 --> 01:37:10,497
Coming in, lce.

753
01:37:12,541 --> 01:37:17,212
That bogey's still behind you.
I'm manoeuvring for a shot.

754
01:37:17,462 --> 01:37:20,465
- Take the shot.
- I can't get a tone.

755
01:37:20,716 --> 01:37:23,969
Shoot. I can't get him off my tail.

756
01:37:27,472 --> 01:37:30,893
- We're hit again.
- We're okay.

757
01:37:31,143 --> 01:37:33,937
On the count of three, break hard right.

758
01:37:34,188 --> 01:37:37,816
Three ... two ... one ... break right!

759
01:37:41,028 --> 01:37:44,281
Firing!

760
01:37:46,575 --> 01:37:50,120
- Damn it, I missed.
- Don't let him go.

761
01:37:50,370 --> 01:37:54,374
I got him. Here comes the shot.

762
01:38:00,506 --> 01:38:03,550
Strike three.

763
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:08,555
- There's a MiG on your tail.
- We've only got one missile left.

764
01:38:08,805 --> 01:38:11,600
1 10 miles, sir.

765
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:14,561
I got him. He's on our tail.

766
01:38:21,527 --> 01:38:25,822
He's still with us.

767
01:38:28,283 --> 01:38:33,163
- You're slowing down.
- I'm bringing him in closer.

768
01:38:38,544 --> 01:38:43,048
- This is it.
- I'll hit the brakes. He'll fly right by us.

769
01:38:47,010 --> 01:38:49,304
Now!

770
01:38:53,308 --> 01:38:55,853
I've got a good lock. Firing.

771
01:38:59,565 --> 01:39:01,900
Strike four!

772
01:39:05,612 --> 01:39:11,243
This is Voodoo Three.
Remaining MiGs are bugging out.

773
01:39:24,339 --> 01:39:29,928
- This is Maverick, requesting fly-by.
- Negative, the pattern is full.

774
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:35,517
Is there something I should know about?

775
01:39:54,077 --> 01:39:56,747
Goddamn that guy.

776
01:40:51,885 --> 01:40:55,806
You!

777
01:40:56,056 --> 01:41:00,018
You are still dangerous.

778
01:41:02,479 --> 01:41:05,816
But you can be my wingman anytime.

779
01:41:06,066 --> 01:41:10,571
Bullshit. You can be mine.

780
01:42:00,996 --> 01:42:06,084
Maverick?. You're on the front pages
of all the English-speaking world.

781
01:42:06,335 --> 01:42:10,255
Even though the other side
denies the incident, congratulations.

782
01:42:10,506 --> 01:42:16,929
They gave you your choice of duty, son.
Where do you think you want to go?

783
01:42:17,179 --> 01:42:21,725
- I thought of being an instructor, sir.
- Top Gun?

784
01:42:21,975 --> 01:42:25,521
- Yes, sir.
- God help us.
