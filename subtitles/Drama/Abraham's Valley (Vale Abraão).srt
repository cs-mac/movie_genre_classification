00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,359
<i>land of the man, God in vain</i>
<i>forced to confront his own pride,</i>

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,674
<i>his own anger and shame,</i>

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,956
<i>things happen that seem</i>
<i>to come from a world of dreams,</i>

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,829
<i>a world of sheer hypocrisy.</i>

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,758
<i>Abraham had the archaic custom</i>

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:37,672
<i>of using his wife's looks</i>
<i>to get out of trouble.</i>

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,755
<i>He said she was his sister,</i>

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,790

SCREENPLAY

13
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,277
BASED ON THE NOVEL BY

14
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,834
<i>In the 18th century, the river Paiva</i>

15
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,753
<i>was the southern boundary</i>
<i>of the district of Lamego.</i>

16
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,989
<i>A clever doctor, an expert in phlegm,</i>

17
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,119
<i>called Abraham of Paiva, lived there.</i>

18
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,432
<i>He was caught in bed</i>
<i>with a woman from Moimenta,</i>

19
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,434
<i>who later suffered a sordid abortion,</i>

20
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,111
<i>so he went down to Balsemão</i>

21
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,992
<i>and vanished,</i>
<i>which was all he deserved.</i>

22
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,593
<i>Such is Abraham's Vale:</i>
<i>its shade and estates</i>

23
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,708
<i>still bear the trace</i>
<i>of a Moorish road,</i>

24
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,191
<i>busy with Granada's Orient trade.</i>

25
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,430
<i>Today, the blood of the Paivas</i>
<i>runs in Carlos,</i>

26
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,151
<i>who studied medical science</i>
<i>in Oporto,</i>

27
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,512
<i>married to a widow and settled</i>
<i>on the estate in Abraham's Vale.</i>

28
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,994
<i>One day, Carlos Paiva came to</i>
<i>Lamego, near Abraham's Vale.</i>

29
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,438
<i>It was the feast of Remédios.</i>

30
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,672
<i>There he met the 14-year-old daughter</i>

31
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,193
<i>of a respectable man, eating eels</i>
<i>in the main square.</i>

32
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,640
<i>In the star outside</i>
<i>Ema saw an omen.</i>

33
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,309
Pure honey.

34
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,315
They are perfect!

35
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,119
No, no!

36
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,353
You have them, they are a specialty.

37
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,437
Say thank you to the nice man.

38
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,949
Mr.?

39
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,671
Carlos, Carlos de Paiva.

40
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,754
Carlos? Thank you, Mr. Carlos.

41
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,508
Doctor and ploughman, at your service.

42
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,116
Doctor and ploughman!
I have been ill...

43
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,115
Please take a seat...

44
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,548
Symptoms, minor complaints,

45
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,396
which oddly, time seems to heal.
Strangest of all...

46
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,599
<i>His soul lit up on meeting</i>
<i>a doctor and ploughman,</i>

47
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,789
<i>so he told him the saga</i>
<i>of his many diseases,</i>

48
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,833
<i>but not much about his wife.</i>

49
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,195
<i>She wasn't long dead</i>
<i>and he missed her beauty.</i>

50
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,432
<i>Ema, his only daughter,</i>
<i>took after her.</i>

51
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,999
Ema's just like her.

52
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,117
I've an uncle in Estremadura.

53
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,596
I have family there myself.

54
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,078
<i>That Estremadura connection</i>
<i>drew them together.</i>

55
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,155
<i>The old man gave him his address</i>

56
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,199
<i>and said he'd call him</i>
<i>if he was unwell.</i>

57
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,428
I got better and became
an almost healthy person.

58
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,509
A doctor's fate! I'm only ever asked
over for purges and bleeding.

59
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,878
<i>Ema thought him a fool.</i>

60
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,430
<i>Nobody purges or bleeds any more.</i>

61
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,472
<i>She noted his masculine grace</i>

62
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,513
<i>and didn't see him again.</i>

63
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,796
<i>Or think about him.</i>

64
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,317
<i>Carlos Paiva returned home.</i>

65
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,832
<i>His wife was washing her feet.</i>

66
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,716
<i>She had a fungus between the fingers,</i>
<i>where she put yellow powder.</i>

67
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,116
<i>She was sullen, shouted very loud</i>
<i>and dressed badly.</i>

68
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,749
<i>Suddenly, Carlos realized all that</i>

69
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,198
<i>and became gentle and soft to her.</i>

70
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,669
<i>He kept saying she was right.</i>
<i>She got suspicious.</i>

71
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,229
He saw someone.

72
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,199
<i>She thought, as lucid as someone</i>
<i>sentenced to death.</i>

73
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,828
<i>She began spying upon him.</i>

74
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,916
<i>Time passed and nothing happened.</i>

75
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,156
<i>We never know when the heart suffers</i>

76
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,513
<i>or gains coal to maintain the heat.</i>

77
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,111
Where's Romesal?

78
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,674
Where's Romesal?

79
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,155
Tell him!

80
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,515
Romesal? Straight on...
but be careful!

81
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,471
Yes, watch out!

82
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,474
<i>There was nothing to say</i>
<i>when Paulino called him up.</i>

83
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,156
<i>He was wearing an old jacket.</i>

84
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,792
<i>It was a cold autumn day</i>

85
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,635
<i>and there was no heating</i>
<i>in the drawing-room, up the stairs.</i>

86
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,755
What brings you here, Dr. Carlos?

87
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,509
Carlos...

88
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,398
Paiva, Carlos Paiva.

89
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,235
That's right, Doctor Carlos Paiva.

90
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,110
I'm looking for a good wine

91
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,995
and knowing your expertise...

92
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,591
It's got to be right,

93
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,393
from a good cellar.

94
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,388
I haven't got it.

95
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,033
But I'm sure we'll manage.

96
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,352
It'll be expensive, Doctor.

97
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,752
A royal beverage!

98
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,636
Though even kings drink plonk
and think they're doing OK.

99
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,151
I swear, I'm...

100
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,553
<i>Ema seemed even prettier,</i>

101
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,311
<i>her blonde locks falling</i>

102
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,196
<i>on a coarse-knit fisherman's sweater.</i>

103
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,109
Do you remember Doctor Carlos,
from Lamego?

104
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,277
No, I don't remember.

105
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,710
<i>But Ema did remember.</i>

106
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,031
<i>She thought he was handsome,</i>
<i>with his neat, salesman's teeth.</i>

107
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,151
<i>Ema thought salesmen must have</i>
<i>nice teeth to smile so much.</i>

108
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,393
In Lamego?

109
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,669
Yes, in Lamego.

110
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,753
I must attend to my patients.

111
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,192
Even if this is a sick call...

112
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,954
Ema, bring a glass of wine
and some biscuits.

113
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,119
There aren't any biscuits.

114
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,629
Don't go to any trouble.

115
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,789
<i>Carlos noticed an antique altar</i>

116
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,829
<i>of surprising and original beauty.</i>

117
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,597
It's a good piece, an inheritance

118
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,872
that my sister Augusta worships.
But she's not home today.

119
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,718
Shut up, Jordão!
What's wrong with you?

120
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,912
<i>Cardeano showed Carlos the way out,</i>
<i>the same way he came in,</i>

121
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,552
<i>through the main gate,</i>
<i>which was never used.</i>

122
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,312
<i>Absurdly, Carlos left feeling bitter.</i>

123
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,953
<i>'Who does she think she is?',</i>
<i>he thought.</i>

124
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,275
<i>Ema was orphaned at the age of six.</i>

125
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,075
<i>Once, when she had earache,</i>
<i>they put her mother's milk in her ear.</i>

126
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,876
<i>She remembered a trickle,</i>
<i>the feel of her mother's breast.</i>

127
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,833
<i>The rest was a secret connection</i>
<i>with the belly whence she came,</i>

128
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,751
<i>where everything moved</i>
<i>with elastic ease.</i>

129
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,993
<i>Perhaps the walls of the womb,</i>
<i>with plenty of give,</i>

130
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,071
<i>nourishment, growing hands and feet.</i>

131
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,119
Aunt Augusta takes communion
every day,

132
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,758
you pray so much you must have
earned yourself an armchair in heaven.

133
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,233
You're right.

134
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,349
God knows I can't go long
without resting my elbows.

135
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,157
But you ought to believe in God, Ema,

136
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,229
and pray,

137
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,636
instead of reading
all those love stories.

138
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,713
Women have no business
reading those books.

139
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,313
They aren't any concern of ours.

140
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,515
Why not?

141
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,635
Why not?

142
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,992
Because they are overpowering.

143
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,391
Even without reading Amadis of Gaul
or Orlando Furioso,

144
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,399
who loved ladies with no culture,

145
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,592
ignorant of Latin.

146
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,875
<i>Ema gazed at the altar,</i>

147
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,669
<i>as if unburdening herself</i>
<i>of a uniform,</i>

148
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,628
<i>heavy with lace and ornaments,</i>

149
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,759
<i>as if the memory of the cruel drama</i>

150
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,391
<i>of her mother's death</i>
<i>stood by this altar</i>

151
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,989
<i>that was like a theatre set.</i>

152
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,711
Aunt is frightened of me.

153
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,077
You'd be happier if I was a nun.

154
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,109
You'd like to see me in a habit,

155
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,436
with a rosary at my belt, like yours.

156
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,270
<i>Her laughter was crystalline,</i>

157
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,148
<i>like a female response</i>

158
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,428
<i>to the male nightingale's song.</i>

159
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,678
Behave yourself, miss!

160
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,192
A nun? The young lady?

161
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,674
That's what they're saying.

162
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,233
That's all we need!

163
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,273
<i>Marina was tough.</i>

164
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,349
<i>Boys who tried it on,</i>
<i>soon thought twice.</i>

165
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,034
Well, I'll tell you this,

166
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,672
she's too young and too pretty
for a convent.

167
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,471
<i>Branca was easier-going.</i>

168
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,037
<i>She liked men, without submission,</i>
<i>just for the heck of it.</i>

169
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,838
<i>Alice had a plan - she was going</i>
<i>to marry someone with money.</i>

170
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,950
<i>All of them liked Ema</i>
<i>and gossiping with her.</i>

171
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,711
<i>The washerwoman was dumb,</i>
<i>from a family of idiots.</i>

172
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,791
<i>But Ritinha was cunning and curious</i>
<i>about the world.</i>

173
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,198
<i>She was as strong</i>
<i>and as flexible as a vine.</i>

174
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,711
<i>The house was a hive of rumors,</i>

175
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,636
<i>abuzz with plots and gossip,</i>

176
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,793
<i>where the talk was of sex, desire</i>
<i>and all the hurts of love.</i>

177
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,676
She can't hear, don't talk to her.

178
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,115
She knows a thing or two

179
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,395
more than we do.

180
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,633
She can tell the type of grape
from the wine stain

181
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,189
And blood on sheets, if it's nice
and red, she says it's a virgin's.

182
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,358
If it's dark, it's a married woman's.

183
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,518
If it's heavy, then it's nearly over.

184
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,110
Hey, what else do you know?

185
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,840
How can you tell,
since she can't speak?

186
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,475
You can see in her eyes
what she doesn't say

187
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,551
and from the way she moves.

188
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,230
A man's got to react
with so many lovely women!

189
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,676
Look at that!

190
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,310
I can say that myself.
What a waste to have your arms

191
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,752
in cold water instead of
around a man's warmth.

192
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,309
What next, scarecrow?

193
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,040
Give me a go with one like you.

194
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,592
Get out of here!

195
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,514
Men!

196
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,273
Are you sighing, woman?

197
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,158
What about you, eh?

198
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,878
- No.
- You are!

199
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,389
- I am not!
- You are!

200
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,755
That's it, I'm not.

201
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,199
That's it, you are!

202
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,995
Sometimes yes, sometimes no!

203
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,510
Sometimes no, sometimes yes!

204
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,197
<i>Ritinha was too pretty</i>
<i>to escape masculine attention.</i>

205
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,109
<i>She was fascinated</i>
<i>by the depths of men's gaze.</i>

206
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,588
<i>But she resisted them.</i>

207
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,715
<i>Even when she liked someone,</i>
<i>she always said no.</i>

208
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,111
<i>She sensed that her children</i>
<i>would be deaf and dumb</i>

209
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,035
<i>and that her husband</i>
<i>would commit suicide as a result.</i>

210
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,236
<i>So she remained a virgin</i>
<i>until the end.</i>

211
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,159
<i>Till she was fourteen,</i>

212
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,477
<i>Ema never left the house.</i>

213
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,151
<i>She was confirmed</i>

214
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,675
<i>at the family altar.</i>

215
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,235
<i>Only once, she went out to present</i>
<i>herself to the Mello ladies,</i>

216
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,156
<i>very tasteful</i>
<i>and respectable they were.</i>

217
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,912
<i>They spent winters in Cascais</i>

218
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,079
<i>and received Ema now in their house</i>
<i>in Viso.</i>

219
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,070
<i>They were two sisters,</i>
<i>one of them widowed.</i>

220
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,598
<i>Ema tried to hide her slight limp.</i>

221
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,956
<i>She climbed the stairs and took fright</i>

222
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,234
<i>when she suddenly</i>
<i>saw herself in the mirror.</i>

223
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,110
<i>She stood mesmerized.</i>

224
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,070
<i>She entered the drawing-room.</i>

225
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,430
<i>As soon as the sisters saw her,</i>

226
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,839
<i>the same dreadful thought</i>
<i>occurred to them:</i>

227
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,109
<i>"this girl is already</i>
<i>a formidable woman".</i>

228
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,789
<i>Ema conveyed</i>
<i>some kind of extreme.</i>

229
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,993
<i>Her beauty was exuberant</i>

230
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,909
<i>and thus dangerous.</i>

231
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,075
There's something unpleasant,

232
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,630
something sinister about her,

233
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,870
including her looks.

234
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,952
Do you really think she's a beauty?

235
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,713
I don't know how to put it...

236
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,439
Her beauty is a kind of genius.

237
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,039
Come closer.

238
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,233
We want to have a look at you.

239
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,669
Yes...

240
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,789
We want to have a good look at you.

241
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,749
You're very lovely.

242
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,709
Isn't she, sister?

243
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,752
Not bad. Not bad at all.

244
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,079
<i>Ema smiled as if to bite them,</i>

245
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,872
<i>which convinced the sisters,</i>
<i>absolutely and doubtlessly,</i>

246
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,632
<i>that she'd grow</i>
<i>into a very threatening woman.</i>

247
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,519
How were the ladies?

248
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,595
Look, Father...

249
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,237
It was horrible. They sniffed at me
as if I was an animal.

250
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,953
They are educated women.

251
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,748
Maybe, but it's a tough education,

252
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,480
not for the faint-hearted.

253
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,909
Aren't you being a little harsh?

254
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,838
I'm telling you what I think.

255
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,397
I've got a surprise for you.

256
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,910
A memento from your confirmation.

257
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,912
The cheek! They'll pay for this!

258
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,075
<i>Ema didn't know how to deal</i>
<i>with obvious lust,</i>

259
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,956
<i>capable of undressing her</i>
<i>with pointless rage.</i>

260
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,715
<i>Was it her imagination?</i>
<i>Weren't they innocent?</i>

261
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,712
<i>And her provoking this terrible need,</i>
<i>blind to generosity.</i>

262
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,150
<i>Their desire was obvious and criminal,</i>

263
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,191
<i>the only reason for patience</i>
<i>in the face of death.</i>

264
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,991
<i>Ema's appearances on the terrace</i>
<i>caused accidents.</i>

265
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,708
<i>That wall was a rampart.</i>

266
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,229
<i>Dogs and cats were run over.</i>

267
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,231
<i>People lost control</i>
<i>of their vehicles, causing panic.</i>

268
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,510
<i>The situation got worse</i>
<i>and the authorities were informed.</i>

269
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,355
Marina! Alice!

270
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,879
These servants!
No one tells me anything!

271
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,435
What's wrong with Ema?

272
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,994
The mayor's complained about people
driving into our wall

273
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,436
because of her.
There've been deaths.

274
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,869
Marina!
Answer me!

275
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,431
Miss... Miss Ema...

276
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,789
Yes, what about her?

277
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,668
Well, Miss Ema...

278
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,197
She uses the terrace...
but only occasionally!

279
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,758
The glare of our windows
seems to blind motorists.

280
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,798
You can't blame the young lady.

281
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,109
Naturally!

282
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,357
<i>He said the word "naturally"</i>

283
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,270
<i>like a lawyer, to win time.</i>

284
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,472
<i>It was agreed</i>
<i>that the windows of the verandah,</i>

285
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,358
<i>when the sun shone,</i>

286
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,394
<i>reflected its rays into drivers' eyes.</i>

287
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,555
<i>The verandah was a conservatory</i>
<i>full of begonias,</i>

288
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,072
<i>maidenhairs and red flowers,</i>

289
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,230
<i>in view of the four o'clock train</i>

290
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,712
<i>to Oporto,</i>
<i>for family and friends to go home.</i>

291
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,110
Little angels, they are!

292
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,548
Ema fell ill when she was five.

293
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,074
After plenty of prayers,
she recovered.

294
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,591
But her left leg had a limp.

295
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,353
Yes, she was handicapped.
What a shame!

296
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,154
It doesn't show.

297
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,599
Of course it shows!

298
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,150
See! He can't bear her.

299
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,313
So? Beauty...

300
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,034
undermines our little games.

301
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,309
<i>Nelson had given up his vocation</i>

302
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,558
<i>to enjoy with Branca, the maid,</i>

303
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,553
<i>a secret affair,</i>

304
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,876
<i>but it was Ema that he really loved.</i>

305
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,032
I'm not that pretty!

306
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,079
You don't like mirrors.

307
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,439
He's really fallen for her.

308
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,669
I know he has.

309
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,270
All because of that damn wall.

310
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,551
Imagine, the mayor, a friend,

311
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,950
wanted me to move the wall back.

312
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,595
They'll send Ema to prison.

313
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,798
It isn't like that.

314
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,192
I have certain responsibilities.

315
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,672
There are complaints.

316
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,154
If you knew

317
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,788
what a father
has to go through, Homero.

318
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,391
She's a lovely daughter.

319
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,269
She's not to go near the terrace!

320
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,789
So lovely and no suitor?

321
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,110
Pretty girls must marry quick.

322
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,395
True.

323
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,113
I don't disagree.

324
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,314
I shouldn't but I'm so greedy!

325
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,230
It's true, it's time Ema got married.

326
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,798
There are plenty of suitors,
but what a sacred loss.

327
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,116
I'll have rowdy grandchildren like the
ones from Carmesim and Chélinha.

328
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,919
Little angels!

329
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,035
Well, Ema?

330
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,471
Let's not talk about it here, Father.

331
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,638
A husband's love is best,

332
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,194
beauty is the fruit of love.

333
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,588
Well said.

334
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,433
Branca, you're so clumsy!

335
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,713
You should be ashamed, Ema!

336
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,310
'I went hunting that day'

337
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,437
'and caught a fine canary.'

338
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,553
'I gave it as a gift'

339
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,632
'to the king's daughter.'

340
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,352
'To the daughter of the king,'

341
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,637
'she's rich and she's Brazilian.'

342
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,636
'She ordered a cage of precious wood.'

343
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,235
'When the cage was ready,
she put the canary inside.'

344
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,952
'By day and by night
the bird is her pleasure.'

345
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,155
'The canary escaped
and caught a cold.'

346
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,232
'Experts were called,'

347
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,919
'21 consultants.'

348
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,077
'But with the doctors came'

349
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,993
'the louse and the flea.'

350
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,951
'The canary died, poor thing,
and was buried.'

351
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,589
'There was a party at the end.'

352
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,876
On the back of an ant,

353
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,793
beautiful Josefa,
I danced a gig.

354

358
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,676
<i>Tearing at bodily symbols</i>

359
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,676

<i>a person's nature,</i>

360
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,354

361

<i>Hideous motions, similar to ancient</i>

<i>prohibited by men,</i>

363

<i>so love shoulders the blame</i>
<i>for Eros’ mediocrity.</i>

364
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,554
<i>Ema knew of unspeakable examples</i>

365

<i>of love's critical role</i>

366

369

<i>Aunt Augusta fell ill.</i>

370
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,438
<i>Death came suddenly, as usual.</i>

371
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,994
<i>Ema was shocked.</i>

372
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,793
<i>Though her aunt's life had been</i>
<i>discreet, Ema took the loss badly.</i>

373
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,311
<i>Branca, the maid, wasn't much help.</i>

374
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,598
<i>She took to her bed with bellyache.</i>

375
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,392
<i>Dr. Paiva was called urgently.</i>

376
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,832
<i>Carlos was surprised:</i>
<i>Ema was even more beautiful</i>

377
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,514
<i>now that there was hurt.</i>

378
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,158
<i>To Ema, Carlos seemed sad</i>

379
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,837
<i>and she discovered she liked sadness,</i>

380
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,000
<i>as a reward for sacrifice.</i>

381
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,957
Thank you for coming.

382
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,355
It all happened so fast.

383
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,073
One disaster after another.

384
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,598
Have I come too late?

385
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,679
No, for my poor sister,
it happened so quickly.

386
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,434
God have mercy on her!

387
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,834
My deepest sympathy.

388
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,595
Thank you.

389
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,954
Thank you.

390
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,476
But you're in mourning yourself.

391
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,474
My wife died.

392
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,632
It happened suddenly.

393
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,472
We're very sorry to hear it.

394
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,509
Thank you.

395
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,432
<i>Ema's sacrifice was that she hated</i>
<i>the life she led.</i>

396
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,188
<i>She no longer went out on the terrace</i>

397
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,712
<i>to show off her beauty.</i>

<i>What was beauty for</i>

399

<i>if only to be gawped at by salesmen</i>
<i>and laborers?</i>

400
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,593
Please, see to Branca, the maid.

401
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,673
She is in terrible pain.

402
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,717
Ema, please show the doctor the way.

403
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,479
This way.

404
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,317
Branca, Dr. Paiva's come to see you.

405

Please come in.

406

<i>Weakness in the guise of strength.</i>

407
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,551
<i>One shove and Ema would fall.</i>

408
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,277
<i>There were no rules</i>
<i>except unpredictability.</i>

409
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,756
<i>Ema knew there was only</i>
<i>one thing for it:</i>

410
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,752
<i>she must pretend, play dead.</i>

411
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,596
<i>Yes, it was Nelson,</i>

412
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,357
<i>the man who lost his vocation.</i>

413
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,757
<i>Branca, pregnant by him,</i>

414
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,915
<i>had had a secret abortion</i>

415
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,756
<i>and the excuse of the whole house.</i>

416
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,395
<i>Carlos decided not to betray her.</i>

417
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,795
<i>Her beauty surfaced upon the silk</i>
<i>of slumbering hurt.</i>

418
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,554
<i>She was like a wild beast</i>
<i>without food,</i>

419
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,718
<i>an animal, a tiny creature,</i>

420
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,998
<i>but with already predatory looks.</i>

421
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,673
<i>She knew that her ties</i>
<i>with mediocrity</i>

422
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,989
<i>and her love of childish ways</i>
<i>were broken.</i>

423
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,157
<i>As she unbound her hair,</i>

424
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,799
<i>her heart, too, was unchained,</i>

425
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,116
<i>though she found comfort</i>
<i>in constraint,</i>

426
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,117
<i>and that was gone forever.</i>

427
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,029
<i>Her mother had been</i>
<i>the fourth daughter</i>

428
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,871
<i>of rich people fallen on bad times.</i>

429
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:15,114
<i>Ema remembered hat boxes</i>
<i>full of postcards</i>

430

<i>her mother received</i>
<i>from Lausanne and Paris.</i>

431
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,510
<i>Nelson, the trainee priest,</i>
<i>married an heiress,</i>

432

<i>whose appeal lay in what was missing.</i>

433
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,351
<i>The bride practically raped him</i>
<i>before and after the wedding.</i>

434
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,635
<i>She died soon,</i>
<i>bequeathing him to a friend,</i>

435
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,677
<i>as if he'd been a pearl necklace.</i>

436
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,954
<i>By spring,</i>

437
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,633
<i>Ema was engaged.</i>

438
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,276
<i>Carlos was silly with joy.</i>

439
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,797
<i>Twice, he put back the wedding</i>

440
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,232
<i>to show he wasn't giving in</i>
<i>to that woman he loved.</i>

441
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,554
<i>He was afraid of Ema's character,</i>

442
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,276
<i>so much at odds with the vain</i>
<i>submissiveness of her upbringing.</i>

443
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,229
Look! Is that a different river?

444
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,353
<i>Ema thought perhaps</i>
<i>it was deep down full of giant fish</i>

445
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,115
<i>that rarely raised their shining heads</i>
<i>up from the deep.</i>

446
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,037
We can't try a dress on like that.

447
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,958
Come and see, it's changed!

448
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,078
No, miss,
the Douro's always been there.

449
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,508
It's a man.

450
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,875
A man?

451
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,397
Yes, seen from a distance
a man looks like a needle.

452
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,438
There's fog, the river is not clear.

453
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,320
You can't see clearly
but it looks like...

454
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,193
A boat... drifting.

455
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,395
Maybe.

456
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,354
I know, it's the ferry that takes
passengers over to the baths.

457
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,591
I'm getting married
and I don't love him.

458
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,871
Please miss! You say
such silly things sometimes...

459
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,549
Sweet Lord! Holy Mother!

460
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,552
<i>Marina's questions distracted her.</i>

461
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:28,153
<i>Then Branca helped to dress her,</i>
<i>with the seamstress, Judith,</i>

462
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,880
<i>as a handmaiden.</i>

463
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,710
Something blue, for luck.

464
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,270
More blue, there's never enough.

465
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,151
The blue shoes you asked for.

466
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,157
More blue! Lots of blue for luck.

467
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,636
<i>Carlos asked that the ceremony</i>

468

<i>Mr. Cardeano accepted,</i>

In order that you may be

Marriage is the deliberate
convergence of two people

474
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,589
who decide to unite,
in body and in soul,

475
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,631
in a single destiny,
whatever it may be.

476
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:44,038
<i>Nelson, ex-seminarist</i>
<i>for lack of vocation,</i>

477
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:49,515
<i>twice married, was in love with Ema.</i>

478
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:56,039
<i>He burst into tears when he heard</i>
<i>she was married</i>

479
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,876
<i>and collapsed on to a chair,</i>
<i>as if he was about to die.</i>

480
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,594
<i>He recalled the days</i>
<i>when he held Branca in his arms</i>

481
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:10,111
<i>in the conservatory full of begonias,</i>

482
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,232
<i>where a couple of parrots</i>

483
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,714
<i>chortled at the lovers’ sighs.</i>

484
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,232
Carlos, you must have considered
your decision.

485
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:26,873
Do you willingly take as your
lawful wedded wife

486
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,752
Ema here?

487
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,709
I do.

488
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,158
Ema, you must have considered
your decision.

489
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:40,789
Do you willingly take as your
lawful wedded husband

490
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,992
Carlos here?

491
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,389
I do.

492
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,232
Ema, take this ring

493
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,478
as a sign of my love
and my faithfulness.

494
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,596
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

495
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,518
Carlos, take this ring

496
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,072
as a sign of my love
and my faithfulness.

497
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,394
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

498
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,470
<i>At Romesal,</i>
<i>at dusk on the wedding day,</i>

499
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,717
<i>a nightingale trilled so brilliantly,</i>

500
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,156
<i>it delighted whoever was listening.</i>

501
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,594
<i>From the windows of Romesal</i>
<i>you could see Abraham's Vale,</i>

502
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,199
<i>land of the Paiva,</i>
<i>the Luminares and the Semblano clans.</i>

503
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,994
<i>Ema couldn't persuade</i>
<i>Branca to leave,</i>

504
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,278
<i>because she wanted to marry</i>
<i>her policeman</i>

505
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,669
<i>and Marina refused too,</i>
<i>because she was engaged.</i>

506
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,429
<i>Only Ritinha, the dumb one,</i>
<i>came to Abraham's Vale.</i>

507
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,552
Yes, yes... this is Dr. Paiva's.

508
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,793
No, he's not in.

509
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,159
He'll be here at dinner time.

510
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,555
You're welcome.

511
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,234
<i>Carlos was always out on calls.</i>

512
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,554
<i>Ema felt abandoned,</i>

513
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,754
<i>and because of emergencies,</i>

514
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:47,632
<i>Carlos insisted on separate rooms</i>
<i>so his wife's sleep wasn't disturbed.</i>

515
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,551
<i>Ritinha, though dumb,</i>
<i>was a perfect spy.</i>

516
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,552
<i>Her lack of certain faculties</i>
<i>turned into a wonderful sixth sense.</i>

517
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,474
<i>Nothing escaped her.</i>

518
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,994
<i>She was doglike in her devotion.</i>

519
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,756
<i>Ema loved her dearly.</i>

520
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,428
<i>She trusted her with everything,</i>

521
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:30,070
<i>keys, wine, jewels and letters.</i>

522
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,354
Are you coming with us?

523
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,154
No, I'll stay here for a bit.

524
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,554
Come on, Ema.

525
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,316
No, I like it here.

526
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,677
Be like that, we're off.

527
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:13,076
<i>When Carlos’ sisters</i>

528
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,035
<i>said she'd lost a handkerchief,</i>

529
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:21,835
<i>Ritinha left without a word.</i>

530
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:28,273
<i>Anyway Carlos didn't see the point,</i>
<i>she couldn't answer the phone.</i>

531
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:36,077
<i>But Ema was hurt,</i>
<i>she missed Ritinha,</i>

532
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,190
<i>she'd looked after her,</i>
<i>played with her,</i>

533
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,959
<i>she was a last link with Romesal</i>

534
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,749
<i>and the wide corridors and hallways</i>

535
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,788
<i>of her childhood.</i>

536
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,831
<i>Intending to put an end</i>
<i>to Ema's ill-humor,</i>

537
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,673
<i>Carlos took her the next Sunday</i>
<i>to the mess in Caverneira,</i>

538
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:06,399
<i>in the house of the Semblanos,</i>
<i>a very respected clan in that area.</i>

539
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,031
The Holy Gospel of Our Lord
Jesus Christ,

540
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,072
according to St. Luke.

541
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,239
Glory be to thee, O Lord.

542
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,117
At that time,
Jesus said to his disciples:

543
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,710
'And there will be signs in sun
and moon and stars,'

544
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,914
'and upon the earth distress
of nations'

545
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,873
'in perplexity at the roaring of the sea
and the waves,'

546
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,110
'men fainting with fear'

547
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,549
'and with foreboding of what is coming
on the world;'

548
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,199
'for the powers of the heavens
will be shaken.'

549
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,831
'And then they will see
the Son of man'

550
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,152
'coming in a cloud
with power and great glory.'

551
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,469
'Now when these things
begin to take place,'

552
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,436
'look up and raise your heads,'

553
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,076
'because your redemption
is drawing near.'

554
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,511
This is the word of the Lord.

555
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,553
Thanks be to God.

556
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,759
Brothers, we are joyful
to be here today

557
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,874
to celebrate the Eucharist.

558
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,797
We just listened to the word of God,

559
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,512
which was announced to us
by the Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ

560
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,514
and refers to recent times.

561
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,628
In a few moments,

562
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:34,790
the Lord will be with us
through the Sacrament,

563
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,953
a sign of His presence.

564
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,669
The time of the Advent has begun.

565
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,589
The Advent is a path of preparation

566
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,760
and hope for Christmas.

567
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,830
Christmas carries us
through time and space to Bethlehem,

568
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,990
so that we can be present
at the birth of Christ.

569
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,997
But the Advent also helps us to live

570
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,557
the reality of Christmas in our times.

571
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,755
So be it.

572
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,637
<i>The Paiva girls thought Ema</i>
<i>was frivolous.</i>

573
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,316
<i>Carlos understandably</i>
<i>but shamefully inquired.</i>

574
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:26,957
<i>He found nothing wrong:</i>
<i>Ema was pure as the stars.</i>

575
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,279
<i>Mr. Cardeano was alone now</i>

576
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:36,239
<i>before the altar that held</i>
<i>so many memories.</i>

577
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,671
<i>After his daughter's wedding,</i>

578
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,635
<i>he took to tears and to drink,</i>

579
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,757
<i>which made him even sadder.</i>

580
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,074
<i>He thought his daughter Ema</i>
<i>knew little about men.</i>

581
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,517
<i>And somehow Carlos didn't seem</i>
<i>the right husband.</i>

582
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,916
<i>Mr. Cardeano remained with his mind</i>
<i>fixed on Abraham's Vale.</i>

583
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,315
<i>Dumb Ritinha returned to Romesal.</i>

584
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,389
<i>Ema, coming from a house</i>
<i>where she was queen.</i>

585
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,154
<i>felt lost in Abraham's Vale.</i>

586
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:49,796
<i>It all began when Carlos brought her</i>
<i>to the Jacas Ball,</i>

587
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,996
<i>invited by the Luminares,</i>

588
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:59,072
<i>who were keen to meet Ema,</i>
<i>without committing themselves.</i>

589
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,558
<i>The rain had stopped</i>
<i>and the moon shone.</i>

590
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:10,034
<i>Bright leaves and stars peeped</i>
<i>through the branches,</i>

591
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,949
<i>giving the night</i>
<i>an air of sublime compassion.</i>

592
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,229
May I?

593
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,118
One doesn't expect to find people
like you here, though I invited you.

594
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,349
Why not?

595
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,433
It's a ball like any other.

596
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,555
Do you know any other?

597
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,838
No, I said 'like any other'.

598
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,234
Aren't they all the same?

599
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,431
In films, they are.

600
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,637
<i>Luminares wasn't listening.</i>

601
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,393
<i>If Ema learnt to dress, he thought,</i>

602
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:48,317
<i>she would create quite a stir.</i>

603
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,389
Is something wrong?

604
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,154
How could it be, beside such beauty?

605
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,273
On the contrary!

606
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,439
I was just thinking how unsettling
beauty is.

607
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,069
Look.

608
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,235
The romantic purity of the Moon

609
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,000
and an Angel, gentle as Cupid.

610
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,155
Look at this one.

611
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:25,158
It's the Sun,
its erotic burning desire,

612
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,152
king of creation, symbol of love.

613
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,748
Cupid, an angel, adores him.

614
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,435
A lovely woman...

615
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,793
...sometimes hides
in a pure and romantic expression

616
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,919
a burning desire.

617
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,754
This lady's face for instance.

618
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,593
May I present my friend,

619
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:20,229
owner of estate called Vesúvio
and a great traveler,

620
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,909
Fernando Osório.

621
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,558
Dr. Carlos' Paiva's wife.

622
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,439
An enormous pleasure.

623
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,637
Imagine meeting
when the blues are playing.

624
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:43,348
The blues belong to my father's day,
to the 20's.

625
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:44,674
They're back in fashion.

626
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:46,915
Shall we dance?

627
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,474
I'm no good.

628
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,956
I insist. Are you scared?

629
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,713
You've only yourself to blame.

630
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,669
Tell me... is that her? Ema?

631
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:00,315
I've just been introduced.
Do you want to meet her?

632
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,712
No, thank you. Not till I must.

633
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,035
Are you coming?

634
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,235
I'd love to.

635
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:14,875
What happened?

636
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,194
It's nothing you've done.

637
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,435
She's a circus tiger

638
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,669
who wouldn't survive in the jungle.

639
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:29,509
Evil is for sermons, she doesn't know
if it really exists.

640
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,519
Is she invulnerable?

641
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,435
Everyone loves her.

642
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,511
Even her enemies are friends.

643
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,038
He looks like the night nurse.

644
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,515
Carlos! Carlos!

645
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,110
I'm sorry, I didn't see who it was.

646
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:10,469
This is lucky,
I want to introduce Dr. Paiva's wife.

647
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:12,719
Simona, my wife.

648
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,917
Since we're introducing ourselves,

649
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,391
here I am at the service

650
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,029
of the lovely lady

651
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:23,153
our beloved doctor and friend
Carlos Paiva

652
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,556
has chosen as his wife.

653
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,315
Do you know who I am?

654
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:36,949
I don't know myself.

655
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,192
They call me 'old Semblano'

656
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,068
and say I'm a philandering monkey.

657
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:51,030
I hate spiritual retreats for couples

658
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,518
and I'm afraid I'll fall from grace.

659
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:06,311
<i>Old Semblano was full of himself,</i>
<i>as usual.</i>

660
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,998
<i>The Jacas ball never happened again,</i>

661
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,670
<i>but it stuck in Ema's mind.</i>

662
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,636
<i>At home, in Abraham's Vale,</i>

663
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:22,791
<i>she inhaled the cigars</i>
<i>Fernando Osório left behind,</i>

664
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:27,395
<i>and her belly heaved</i>
<i>with brutal desire,</i>

665
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,959
<i>which she fooled</i>

666
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,989
<i>by sleeping with Carlos.</i>

667
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,389
Were you in bed?

668
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,118
Don't you want the light off?

669
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,154
I can see you better.

670
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:36,468
You're so lovely!

671
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,473
Why have the light off?

672
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,510
Because it's more...

673
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:53,875
...romantic.

674
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:24,789
Come on.

675
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:30,799
<i>Carlos realized Ema knew more</i>
<i>about love</i>

676
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,437
<i>than he had thought.</i>

677
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,877
<i>It was him, Pedro Luminares,</i>

678
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:43,432
<i>who led her, almost by the hand,</i>
<i>to Caverneira,</i>

679
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:47,719
<i>and introduced her to Maria Loreto</i>
<i>and her husband Semblano,</i>

680
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,916
<i>before Carlos thought of it.</i>

681
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,956
<i>But Carlos went with them.</i>

682
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:56,234
And what does Ema think of love?

683
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,673
I don't know what to say.

684
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:20,671
That's the best answer!

685
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,108
Carlos...

686
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,432
...hasn't he taught you?

687
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,112
Do you think it can be taught?

688
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:43,517
That's true,
you either know or you don't.

689
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,033
Isn't that right, Dr. Paiva?

690
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:55,954
Love is...

691
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,513
...an intimate thing.

692
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,119
Maria Loreto,

693
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,834
do you agree?

694
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,159
If your husband says so!

695
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,478
Intimate, but personal.

696
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,109
Very personal!

697
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:13,834
You say it's personal.

698
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,800
In your particular cases.

699
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,708
But mine happen to be different.

700
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,991
Of course, we're all different.

701
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,910
Men and women, for a start.

702
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:30,559
That's elementary.

703
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,875
I reckon hunting and love
have much in common.

704
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,555
The hunter pursues his prey

705
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:42,072
and the prey attracts.
The hunter aims

706
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,754
and love happens.

707
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:49,232
Are you saying women are like games?

708
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:52,552
Not at all Simona,
it was a figure of speech.

709
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,635
For women,
love's a question of talent.

710
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:59,559
Look at that statuette.

711
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:06,392
She's offering herself
and he is quietly unexpected.

712
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,955
You can't tell
when Love comes or goes.

713
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:14,393
He has wings, the night and the moon
are favorable to him.

714
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:17,994
Love is liquid, like clouds.

715
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:22,109
When Psyche awakes,
Love is already gone.

716
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:26,390
That's why I only like Love
when it's there.

717
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:30,989
<i>What did love mean?</i>

718
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:39,590
<i>For Ema,</i>
<i>it was a necessity of social life.</i>

719
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,398
What do you think, Carlos?

720
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,635
What do I think?

721
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:54,719
I live with you...

722
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,358
...and I drink to our love, Ema!

723
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,155
And also...

724
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,154
...to Mrs...

725
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,832
...and Mr. Semblano.

726
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:13,829
<i>She smiled.</i>
<i>The toast seemed hypocritical,</i>

727
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,357
<i>unexpectedly witty and irrelevant.</i>

728
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,235
<i>Carlos was dependent on her</i>
<i>as a worm is dependent on soil,</i>

729
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,676
<i>a far cry from the romantic</i>
<i>attachment she'd given up hoping for.</i>

730
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,758
<i>But she was jealous of Maria Loreto.</i>

731
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,960
Be quiet, you are leaden.

732
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:31,949
Don't talk of others
in front of ladies.

733
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:35,636
'Ladies' is such an old-fashioned idea.

734
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,951
Do you wear a plumed hat?

735
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,196
- No.
- Some people do.

736
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,395
Only Satan.

737
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,069
But how would you know?

738
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,190
I'm off.

739
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,788
Don't go!

740
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:54,595
Why not?

741
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,393
Satan would be afraid of you.

742
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,712
<i>Fernando Osório was ruined</i>

743
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,958
<i>and so entitled to his fantasies.</i>

744
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:08,992
<i>Ruined, for him,</i>
<i>meant gold up to his knees,</i>

745
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:10,673
<i>instead of swimming in it.</i>

746
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:27,310
Thank you, Simona,
that's just what I wanted.

747
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:36,149
<i>Carlos realized Ema was about</i>
<i>to do something rash.</i>

748
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:41,192
<i>He wanted to plan her rashness to fit</i>
<i>his family's ambitions,</i>

749
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,951
<i>at least until the sex</i>
<i>was less vindictive.</i>

750
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,796
<i>He offered her Pedro Luminares,</i>

751
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:54,796
<i>a robot, with one advantage:</i>

752
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,438
<i>he knew how to talk about love.</i>

753
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,833
I've told Simona,

754
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,513
I'm a robot ahead of my time...

755
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,349
...far beyond sex.

756
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:26,349
<i>Ema had the extraordinary power</i>
<i>to make radiant desire</i>

757
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,474
<i>run like bush fire</i>

758
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,718
<i>over corpses of legendary virility,</i>

759
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,073
<i>stubborn virility.</i>

760
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,918
Luminares wants to show us
his power over this woman,

761
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,159
but he won't act.

762
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:55,839
Ema is a flame.

763
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,752
And so beautiful...

764
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,513
You're right, she's a flame.

765
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,591
Poor Dr. Paiva,
at the edge of the abyss.

766
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:47,797
I bet she moans,
makes man and bed moan too!

767
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,433
Barrack-room talk!

768
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,071
Some of them don't moan
even if the bed does.

769
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,671
I bet she makes Carlos groan.

770
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,668
During the day!

771
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:04,789
She's spendthrift,
he has to watch his purse.

772
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,109
Yes...

773
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:09,670
Beauty is beyond price...

774
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:10,989
...and gain!

775
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:16,351
I've heard he wins more
on the Stock Exchange...

776
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,599
...than by working
on people's innards.

777
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,713
Are you happy, Ema?

778
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,316
Yes.

779
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,512
Why do you carry a book about?

780
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:55,515
Is it a shield against vice or desire?

781
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:04,713
I've never thought that.
Perhaps it is.

782
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:07,793
I love books.

783
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,316
I read wherever I can.

784
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,552
<i>The house seemed enchanted,</i>

785
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,439
<i>even farmers said so.</i>

786
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:20,757
<i>Luminares was, after a fashion,</i>
<i>a wise man</i>

787
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,509
<i>with an inclination to lethargy.</i>

788
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:26,993
<i>Ema felt belittled.</i>

789
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,034
It's there to deceive.

790
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:34,831
Deceive?
That's something women do, not men.

791
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,028
Am I deceiving you?

792
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,830
I think in your case we have
what's called

793
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,553
'ascension fever'.

794
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,710
You have no wings
nor any special powers.

795
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:54,236
And you don't want
to jump off the fifth floor.

796
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,278
Because you believe in gravity.

797
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,635
In short,

798
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:04,510
you need a psychiatrist
or a lover.

799
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,075
You're wrong.

800
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:11,879
It's stupid to think
problems can be solved

801
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:13,879
by a fall or a cold shower.

802
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,154
Nothing's that simple.

803
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:20,076
How can you tell
if life hangs by a thread?

804
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,711
What do you tell a woman
in that case?

805
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,193
Man has several ways
of approaching life.

806
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:29,835
Art, war, business.

807
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,433
Women have no choice.

808
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,474
Men can't understand them,
is that it?

809
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:38,594
Are you happy, Ema?

810
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:40,672
You've already asked.

811
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,349
It's cold. Let's go.

812
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:17,549
So here we are,
two homogenous couples.

813
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:22,639
What do you mean?
Marriage is not a mayonnaise.

814
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:25,552
It's time we went Carlos. Goodbye.

815
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:37,472
Excuse me. Goodbye.

816
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:54,198
Carlos can't get used
to Ema's wish

817
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:55,833
that they sleep separately.

818
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,114
What's the reason?

819
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,991
It's healthier
and so as not to wake up

820
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:03,434
when he comes home late.

821
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,196
Ema doesn't really love Carlos.

822
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,751
But Carlos loves her and misses her,

823
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:17,913
the naked skin, the intimacy
of a caress made childish by sleep.

824
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:22,031
But Ema, not he, will end up...

825
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,474
...killing herself?

826
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,717
Yes, I think that's how it'll end.

827
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:28,955
Pregnant?

828
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,715
Pregnant? How do you know?

829
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,552
Ritinha told me.

830
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,997
The washerwoman?
She left ages ago.

831
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,914
Ema visits her father
and Ritinha's back there.

832
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:44,909
Ritinha's a witch.

833
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:47,918
A witch and indiscreet.

834
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,835
It's a crown of stars above my head.

835
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:36,476
<i>They say 'verandah' is a Celtic word</i>
<i>meaning fence,</i>

836
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,309
<i>which is as may be.</i>

837
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:45,633
<i>No one knows why verandahs</i>
<i>were fashionable.</i>

838
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:50,269
<i>Like a belly, verandahs</i>
<i>are a display of authority</i>

839
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,313
<i>and affected desire,</i>

840
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:57,872
<i>which seduces and shows</i>
<i>a person's status.</i>

841
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:02,277
<i>It invites an appraising gaze</i>
<i>which leads to sin,</i>

842
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,474
<i>casting its shade over virginity,</i>

843
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,115
<i>being a place of leisure,</i>

844
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:12,517
<i>more sensual than sinful.</i>

845
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:16,394
<i>The verandah of Abraham's Vale</i>
<i>was put to new use.</i>

846
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:22,274
<i>Ema lived there,</i>
<i>new-born daughters in her arms.</i>

847
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:25,593
You're beautiful!

848
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:28,673
Don't be silly!

849
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,711
<i>Lola was too tall.</i>
<i>She seemed backward.</i>

850
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:38,832
<i>Luisona was prettier and sweeter</i>

851
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,356
<i>and she never ever cried.</i>

852
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:46,951
<i>Ema didn't know what was wrong</i>
<i>with Luisona.</i>

853
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:51,279
<i>Since her own mother</i>
<i>had given birth painlessly.</i>

854
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,837
<i>Nothing affected or hurt her,</i>

855
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:57,594
<i>neither fire nor steel.</i>

856
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,309
Run along inside!

857
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,114
Are you going to Vesúvio?

858
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:17,556
Yes, I need to rest a few days.

859
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:22,078
Your sisters run everything perfectly,

860
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,759
you've your daughters' company.

861
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,473
It's hardly the same.

862
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:30,039
I'll only be a few days.

863
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:33,995
Alright.

864
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,035
Go then.

865
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:48,835
<i>Out of provocation not desire,</i>

866
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:51,719
<i>Ema began her affair with Osório.</i>

867
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:53,878
<i>Anyone would have done.</i>

868
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:58,359
<i>She furthered this story,</i>
<i>in which a sentence</i>

869
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:03,196
<i>was passed in advance</i>
<i>upon the lover.</i>

870
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:08,598
Yes, I'm going to Vesúvio.

871
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:21,672
<i>Almost immediately,</i>
<i>Ema accepted Osório's advances.</i>

872
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:26,159
<i>He was rich, involved in politics,</i>

873
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,836
<i>divorced, three sons in college.</i>

874
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:02,430
Look uncle,
the boss is taking it easy.

875
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:05,514
What about you?
Are you chasing them?

876
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:09,792
Or aren't you in that league?

877
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:16,152
He's rich. If I had money, you'd see!

878
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:18,157
What would I see?

879
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:21,754
How they'd fall for me.

880
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:24,039
You're just a big mouth.

881
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:28,912
Women need special attention.

882
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:32,351
You're too young to know about that.

883
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:34,714
I see!

884
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:36,717
I know more than you think.

885
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,392
It's an art, Fortunato.

886
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,873
I'm here to tell you that
that woman...

887
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,430
...is the kind that makes men wild.

888
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,399
And are you..?

889
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:50,159
Behave yourself!

890
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:53,709
And anyway...

891
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:56,958
Only joking!

892
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,959
Hang on, wait for me!

893
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:08,434
<i>Nearby...</i>

894
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:12,510
<i>... stood a jetty against which</i>
<i>the water beat with a sinister sound.</i>

895
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:23,192
<i>Two rotten planks might easily break</i>
<i>and cause an accident.</i>

896
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:26,950
<i>Ema was warned.</i>

897
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:36,909
<i>It was said La Bandi came to Vesúvio</i>
<i>as Caruso went to Manaus.</i>

898
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,593
<i>Ema listened to Osório's stories</i>

899
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,235
<i>and fell into a respectful daydream,</i>

900
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:47,190
<i>fondly remembering Romesal.</i>

901
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:53,196
<i>She knew that, as a European</i>
<i>gentleman, Osório despised</i>

902
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,909
<i>people who did not know</i>
<i>their place.</i>

903
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:03,310
If I may discuss opera,

904
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:08,432
since I have the honor of meeting
a star of the 'Bel Canto',

905
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,749
I have to say it makes me sad

906
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:16,598
everything is so vulgar nowadays.

907
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,153
There's no opera left.

908
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,878
<i>Who are these two guests?</i>

909
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,390
<i>The fat one is Baltazar,</i>
<i>an opera singer</i>

910
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,793
<i>whom Osório has invited</i>
<i>to impress Ema.</i>

911
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:34,668
<i>The other,</i>
<i>Osório's friend Pedro Dossem,</i>

912
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,668
<i>claims kinship</i>
<i>with St Anthony of Lisbon</i>

913
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:39,678
<i>on the basis</i>
<i>that a Paduan chronicler,</i>

914
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:43,799
<i>Giulielmo Ongarello,</i>
<i>said in 1441</i>

915
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:48,472
<i>that Doson was Anthony's surname.</i>

916
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:03,998
You think opera is dead.

917
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:05,713
Not at all.

918
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:10,310
But we live in an era
when everything is vanishing.

919
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,512
Love, for example,
let's talk about love.

920
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:16,991
Love is not lyrical any more.

921
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:20,755
The pleasures of hypocrisy surpass
those of the bedroom.

922
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,069
Really?

923
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:25,193
Dearest Ema...

924
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:29,949
...there's no sensitivity
in a historical cycle which ends in

925
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:33,433
the battle of Alcácer-Quibir,
the siege of Leningrad,

926
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,352
Trafalgar and Waterloo,

927
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,311
or the 25th April revolution.

928
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,074
You're going too far.

929
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:41,635
Too far?

930
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,669
The new institutions

931
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:49,150
and social mobility
have banished dreams,

932
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,275
be they romantic or practical.

933
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:55,512
Yes sir, affection and feelings
have vanished,

934
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:59,949
human gifts which absorbed
our basser instincts.

935
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:03,680
'Bel Canto' is no longer appreciated

936
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:06,351
and 'Bel Canto' is pure sentiment.

937
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:08,471
That's true.

938
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:11,759
See how the revolution of 1974

939
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,117
marked the end of elegant
feudal customs,

940
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,034
replacing them with party politics.

941
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:20,358
Agreed.

942
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:23,188
This egalitarianism
is demagoguery

943
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:24,998
and it is all-powerful.

944
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,350
People wallow in disappointment.

945
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:30,271
Here and in the colonies.

946
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:33,590
There is a jeans bourgeoisie

947
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:36,479
with bursts of righteousness
against speculation.

948
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:40,471
People's attitude to money
has changed,

949
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:44,794
and to illness, and to sex.

950
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:49,469
Really? Is sex different now?

951
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:53,794
I think it is, Ema.

952
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:55,759
More freedom you mean?

953
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,954
More freedom and less feeling.

954
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:03,599
More sex, no love, no affection.

955
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:07,437
More homosexuals, despite AIDS.

956
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:11,436
No more homosexuals nowadays.

957
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:13,354
Are you defending them?

958
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,951
Neither defending nor blaming.

959
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:19,109
Just stating facts.

960
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:21,509
Not allowing?

961
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:26,952
I don't allow homosexuality
because I can't allow anything...

962
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:29,589
...how shall I put it...

963
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:32,194
...unnatural.

964
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:34,994
That's a relief!

965
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:38,196
Everything can be explained.

966
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:41,591
Perhaps homosexuality

967
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:45,311
is leftover...

968
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:46,595
...androgyny.

969
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:50,756
Androgyny? What's that?

970
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:54,274
It's hard to explain.

971
01:37:55,120 --> 01:38:00,319
I mean a trace
of an androgynous being,

972
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:02,148
a unique, primeval creature

973
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:04,550
who exploded violently

974
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:08,470
into male and female parts.

975
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:12,709
You're delirious!
Or you're making fun of us.

976
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:17,991
It's the truth, I'm serious.

977
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:21,197
There are indications.

978
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:24,114
Why else has a man got nipples?

979
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,512
They are totally useless except as...

980
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,150
...relics of androgyny.

981
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:33,798
Seems very complicated to me.

982
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:37,238
I don't know how we got on
to this subject.

983
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:40,874
I meant to talk about something else.

984
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:42,755
What?

985
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:46,312
Life isn't about being happy any more

986
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:50,589
or distress or wrestling with fate.

987
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:52,914
What's life for then?

988
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:55,475
Life is about...

989
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:56,919
Yes, what is life about?

990
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:01,790
It's about life...

991
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:04,439
That's a funny answer.

992
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:09,111
...or about not living.

993
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:14,189
Life is about being a statistic.

994
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:19,878
That's the bottom line.

995
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:21,479
Don't you agree?

996
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:24,278
Do you want to disagree?

997
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,115
There's your answer.

998
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:29,876
An excellent, most worthy reply!

999
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:35,428
<i>Ema gave herself up</i>
<i>to a kind of disease</i>

1000
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:39,235
<i>deep in her innermost being.</i>

1001
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:42,953
<i>She thought permissiveness</i>
<i>would help.</i>

1002
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:48,592
<i>She knew Osório was trying</i>
<i>to impress her.</i>

1003
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:52,198
<i>So was Pedro Luminares</i>
<i>with his fine words,</i>

1004
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:54,557
<i>with their Faustian ring.</i>

1005
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:10,389
How wonderful!

1006
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,597
What a wonderful view from Vesúvio!

1007
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:17,075
It reminds me of the volcano
that shattered Pompeii.

1008
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:18,633
Correct, my friend.

1009
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,596
Anything else sir?

1010
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,398
No, that's all.

1011
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,113
Very good sir.

1012
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:40,079
He's like a Russian spy.

1013
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:47,154
You soiled that soul,

1014
01:40:56,600 --> 01:41:02,152
my soul's delight.

1015
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:10,114
You had my trust
and your foul behavior

1016
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:17,595
has besmirched the Universe for me.

1017
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:26,551
Traitor!

1018
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:30,469
Those are your thanks for friendship.

1019
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:10,310
Lost sweetness,

1020
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:15,274
the memory of a kiss.

1021
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:46,357
I'm telling you, he's a spy.

1022
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:52,514
That man's a spy!

1023
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:59,554
<i>Osório loved Ema, he believed</i>
<i>her beauty was beyond compare,</i>

1024
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:03,279
<i>but his snobbery came to the fore</i>

1025
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:08,799
<i>when he had to listen</i>
<i>to tales of her saintly aunt Augusta,</i>

1026
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:11,874
<i>with her proverbial goodness.</i>

1027
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:17,108
<i>Ema fooled no one, she had no plots,</i>

1028
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:19,916
<i>she was all show,</i>

1029
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:26,032
<i>dressing and behaving</i>
<i>as if to defeat Holophernes.</i>

1030
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:32,512
<i>Her eroticism was fuelled by power</i>

1031
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:34,398
<i>and social status.</i>

1032
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:48,029
Hello?

1033
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:51,271
It's Mother. It's her!

1034
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:55,952
Daddy's out,

1035
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:58,313
visiting patients.

1036
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:03,116
We're very well,
I've got a bit of a sore throat.

1037
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:09,077
It's nothing,
Daddy says it will soon pass.

1038
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:10,395
Ask where she is.

1039
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:11,834
Where are you, Mummy?

1040
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:13,789
Where?

1041
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:16,396
At Vesúvio? Is it nice there?

1042
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:19,555
We're thinking about you.

1043
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:23,989
We miss you.
