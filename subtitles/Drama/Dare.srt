Well, I would like to start
you on a birth control regimen.

and not telling me about it?

164
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,075
What?

165
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,508
Why?

166
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:36,480
Because your sex drive is,
like, shockingly underdeveloped.

167
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:42,385
Same thing
happened to my dad.

168
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:43,581
Well, whatever.
I'd fuck him.

169
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,521
Your dad?

170
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,752
Ew.

171
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,351
Ooh, you bitch.

172
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,630
Wasn't Grant amazing?

173
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,462
Yeah, I guess so.

174
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,058
Maybe
we should just go.

175
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,195
After you made me
wait 20 minutes? Uh-uh.

176
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,170
You're going up to him
and introducing yourself...

177
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,071
when he comes out.

178
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:06,543
Okay.

179
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,273
There he is.

180
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,244
Well, I don't want him
to think I'm a freak...

181
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,119
for coming to his show
the night before.

182
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,459
Didn't you once tell me
that I should support you...

183
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,018
in everything it is
you want to do?

184
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,119
This is what you want to do,
so I'm supporting you.

185
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,959
- Okay?
- Okay.

186
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,057
- Go.
- Okay, okay, okay.

187
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,373
Grant, hey.

188
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,881
Hey.

189
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:47,111
- Where are we going?
- I so need a drink.

190
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,882
Oh, my God.
This woman in the first row...

191
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,718
What was that?

192
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,225
I don't... I...
I don't even know.

193
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,957
Don't you come toward me
another step, Stanley.

194
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,000
- Or I'll...
- What?

195
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:07,597
Some awful thing will happen.
It will!

196
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,231
What are you putting on now?

197
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,934
I warn you.
Don't.

198
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:11,942
I'm in danger.

199
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,639
Let's stop there, folks.

200
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:15,736
Grant.

201
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:26,716
Donna and Gabby,
you're up next.

202
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,693
It's such an honor
to meet you.

203
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,696
I saw your play last night,
and you were brilliant.

204
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,857
Thanks.

205
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:34,865
Who are you?

206
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:39,166
Uh, Johnny.

207
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,433
Do you want to act?

208
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,601
I don't know.
Maybe.

209
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:48,875
Well, you're raw,
but you've definitely got something.

210
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,780
Has Miss Davis forced
Stanislavsky on you yet?

211
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,216
You should try
actually reading it.

212
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,288
I think you'd really dig it.

213
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:00,382
Oh, yeah, okay.
Thanks.

214
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,189
Uh, Mr. Matson?

215
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:07,460
Could I just have a second
of your time after class?

216
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:20,070
So you think
you want to be an actress.

217
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,546
Okay, well,
we could do some basic stuff,

218
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,344
movement, breath,

219
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,748
your accent.

220
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,411
Or we can cut the bullshit,

221
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,148
and I can tell you
how it really is.

222
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,990
- Um.
- It's your call.

223
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:38,462
Life lessons with Grant
or teen acting class.

224
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,658
Teen acting class?

225
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:41,756
Great.
Life lessons it is.

226
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,233
Get up here.

227
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,090
What were you doing up here?

228
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:11,823
I was trying to show how
Blanche feels about Stanley.

229
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,195
Uh-huh.

230
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:23,272
And what does Blanche
feel about Stanley?

231
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:24,775
Hm?

232
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,903
Well...

233
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,005
I think that she's afraid.

234
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:33,847
I think
that she feels threatened.

235
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,217
At the same time, I think that
she's also still drawn to him,

236
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,516
you know?

237
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:40,889
It's his brute strength
versus her femininity,

238
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,655
her power of seduction.

239
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,254
Okay, you're smart,
so that's not the problem.

240
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,260
But tell me something, um...

241
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,100
Alexa.

242
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:56,539
Have you ever felt threatened?

243
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,338
I feel a little threatened
right now.

244
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,911
Oh, that's good.

245
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:05,280
But no, I meant, have you ever
been afraid of being hurt,

246
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:09,151
destroyed, raped?

247
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,153
No.

248
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,689
You ever fucked anyone?

249
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,419
Sorry, but I don't think
that has anything to do...

250
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,792
It has everything
to do with it.

251
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,024
You shouldn't be playing
Blanche DuBois, honey.

252
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,862
You're a child.

253
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,163
Acting is not about
making up how you think...

254
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,396
someone else feels.

255
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:28,099
It's about having
something to drawn on...

256
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:35,442
A feeling of your own.

257
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:42,787
You ever been
hungry for anything?

258
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,289
- I don't know...
I'm not sure I know exactly...

259
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,653
Hungry.

260
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,784
Like wanting something
or needing something so badly...

261
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,625
that you will do
anything to get it.

262
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:00,802
Look,
life's gonna be easy for you.

263
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,933
You're pretty.
You're smart.

264
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,443
You got it real good.

265
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:09,947
So be a doctor
or a lawyer.

266
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,985
Or better still,
marry one.

267
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:21,018
You have no fucking idea
who I am!

268
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,424
This is what it's about,

269
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,758
right now, the feeling you want
to slap the shit out of me.

270
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,600
I'll learn it.

271
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,191
I'll start
with the Stanislavsky book.

272
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:33,067
What's the exact title?

273
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:40,836
No book in the whole world
can teach you how to feel.

274
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,074
You got to figure
that shit out for yourself.

275
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,774
Well, if you
recommended it to Johnny...

276
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,045
and some mindless asshole
with a God complex can learn it,

277
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:48,177
trust me, I can.

278
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,721
Is that really all you can see?

279
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,485
Let's forget about the scene
and just worry about you.

280
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,584
Shake it up a bit.

281
00:14:55,695 --> 00:15:00,462
Do something
you're afraid of and fail.

282
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:04,935
And after all that...

283
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:09,133
if you still
want to be an actress,

284
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,869
God bless you.

285
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,877
Class dismissed.

286
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,612
[knocking on door]

287
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:24,883
- [clears throat]
- Alexa?

288
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,822
Yeah?

289
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:27,915
Honey, can I come in?

290
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,324
Yeah, sure, come on.

291
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,657
Come on in.

292
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,466
Sweetie, are you sick?
You look sick.

293
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,472
No, just tired.

294
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,667
What's up?

295
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,209
Oh, I was just,
you know,

296
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,438
going through my makeup
clearing stuff out,

297
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:51,381
old nail polishes and stuff.

298
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,542
I was gonna give it to Marva,

299
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,984
but I thought you might
like to take a look.

300
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,851
Sure, yeah.

301
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,118
Are you sure you're okay?

302
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,386
Yeah.

303
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,189
Oh, I thought this
was a good color for you.

304
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,159
- It's pretty.
- Pretty, huh?

305
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,261
Delicate,
don't you think?

306
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:23,007
Well, I'll let you
get back to work.

307
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,912
- Okay.
- Thanks, Mom.

308
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,575
Night.

309
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,481
Do you want me to give you
something to help you sleep?

310
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,617
No, thanks.

311
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,456
I have to meet
my trainer early in the morning,

312
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,621
so I'll see you at dinner.

313
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,908
Alexa?

314
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:27,411
Are you sick?
It's 11:30.

315
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,094
Hey, where the hell
were you this morning?

316
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,924
I took a mental health day.

317
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:46,055
It's not even lunch.

318
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,723
You mean you took
a mental health morning?

319
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,731
You're hilarious.

320
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:49,823
Sweetie...

321
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,631
what is this sweater
you're wearing?

322
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,999
I mean...

323
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,595
get dressed in the dark
or something?

324
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,504
I don't need this shit
from you right now, okay?

325
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,133
So please back off.

00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:03,087
What are you doing, Alexa?

495
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,719
You ditch me
to play with the cool kids.

496
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,661
You put this
streak in your hair.

497
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:08,995
And then all of a sudden,
you're with Johnny?

498
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:10,227
I'm not with Johnny.

499
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:11,768
Yeah, well,
you can't be fucking him.

500
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,929
God, you don't even use tampons.

501
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,802
Why are you being
such an asshole?

502
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,033
This has nothing
to do with you.

503
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:18,803
You can try and play
all mature and worldly,

504
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,377
but you're not.

505
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:24,006
You're still the same scared,
pathetic, perfect little girl.

506
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:26,778
You're still the same bitter,
lonely loser...

507
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,250
who can't stand to see me
have a life...

508
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:30,150
because you never had one.

509
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:35,523
Ben, don't go like that.

510
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,492
Ben.

511
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,778
Don't rush
to judgments.

512
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:06,817
It's a part of development
for every teenager.

513
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,647
Yes, I do understand.

514
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,880
It's not a problem.

515
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,183
Okay.

516
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,882
Talk to you later.

517
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,755
- Morning.
- Morning.

518
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:16,885
Want some tea?

519
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:17,984
Sure.

520
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:25,836
Mom, please stop trying
to psychoanalyze my adolescence...

521
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,564
with your shrink friends.

522
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,936
Ben, I was not
talking about you.

523
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,736
Believe it or not,
you are not the only thing...

524
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,003
I think and talk about.

525
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,511
You could've fooled me.

526
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:37,775
That was Deirdre Walker
on the phone.

527
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:39,282
Isn't it a little early?

528
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,944
Apparently, Alexa
didn't make it home last night.

529
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,520
She spent the night
at some boy's house...

530
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:44,816
and just walked in this morning...

531
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:46,857
as if nothing
was out of the ordinary.

532
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,892
- Johnny Drake?
- Yeah.

533
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:51,462
Do you
know anything about it?

534
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:52,791
No.

535
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:54,889
In a way,
it's kind of a relief.

536
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,558
Wait, what do you mean?

537
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,761
Every parent wants their kid
to veer from the rules...

538
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,098
once in a while.

539
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,263
It's a sign of normalcy.

540
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:02,806
So being a whore
is normal?

541
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:03,806
Ben!

542
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,638
Why are you being
so judgmental?

543
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:07,405
Mom, please.

544
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,810
Listen, Deirdre and Doug
are going out of town,

545
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,940
and they don't feel comfortable
leaving Alexa alone.

546
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,508
Deirdre's completely freaked out
and overreacting, as per usual.

547
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,145
So Alexa's staying with us.

548
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,381
What?

549
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,390
Wait, why didn't you
ask me first?

550
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:22,289
Because it's not
your decision to make, Ben,

551
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,918
and because
she's your oldest friend.

552
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,223
Why is it an issue?

553
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,355
I just don't see why
I should have to suffer...

554
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:28,989
because she can't
control herself.

555
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,795
You're in high school
for Christ's sake.

556
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,062
It's normal.

557
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,103
I'm gonna shower.

558
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:44,907
Do you want me
to make you something to eat?

559
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,177
No, I'm going out.

560
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:48,718
Morning.

561
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:56,490
Fuck.

562
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:57,493
Fuck?

563
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,928
Yes.

564
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,623
Okay.

565
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,542
Stay here.

566
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:22,210
It's one cookie
or one muffin.

567
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,344
One thing...

568
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:28,324
[children whining]

569
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:36,524
You know, I just... I never
want that to be my life.

570
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,296
Yeah.

571
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,449
Edith Wharton?

572
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,677
School or pleasure?

573
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,014
Oh, school...

574
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:58,851
or pleasure.

575
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:01,323
School,
but I also really like it.

576
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:03,860
Yeah, me too,
a lot.

577
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:05,452
I'm Nick.

578
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,030
Ben.

579
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:08,759
Nice to meet you, Ben.

580
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:10,664
Definitely seen you around.

581
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:15,297
I'm working a lot here,
so we should hang out sometime.

582
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,466
I could use
a study partner.

583
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,840
Yeah, yeah.

584
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,641
Uh...

585
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:26,012
Yeah, I got to go.

586
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,584
But it was nice to meet you.

587
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,586
I'll see you.

588
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:12,686
Hey.

589
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,560
What are you doing out here?

590
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:17,032
What are you,
my social conscience?

591
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:19,103
You know, if you're
just gonna be a bitch...

592
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:22,901
Oh, Jesus,
don't be so sensitive.

593
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,237
Come on.
Sit down, Benjamin.

594
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:40,147
Can't believe I don't have
anything better to do...

595
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:44,217
than to watch Johnny and Alexa
pretend to have sex.

596
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:46,593
It's tragic.

597
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:48,325
Yeah, well...

598
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:51,493
Alexa has nothing better to do
than pretend, period.

599
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:52,900
[chortles]

600
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,631
It's not like
it means anything.

601
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:57,731
I mean,
she's really lost her mind.

602
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:58,900
I guess that's what happens...

603
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,103
when you discover
the power of a dick.

604
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:05,639
Okay.

605
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:14,088
God, this is
what it must feel like...

No offense, Ben.

None taken,
you chain-smoking slut.

609
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:34,272
Hey.

610
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:36,847
Don't tell Alexa I said
any of this shit, okay?

611
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,077
All right.

612
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,055
Hey, you want to watch
from the lighting booth?

613
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,456
Might as well
be queen of the losers.

614
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:10,506
I kind of just want
to sleep tonight.

615
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:12,879
We can do that.

616
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,680
I got in trouble.

617
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,779
My parents are freaked.

618
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:23,292

They're just mad.

00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,656
So?

621
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:29,164
So I should
probably just go to Ben's...

622
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:32,236
and be good tonight.

623
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:34,032
Well, what about me?

624
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,537
What do you mean?

625
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:39,738
Forget it.
Never mind.

00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,607
Couldn't we
just talk tomorrow?

Okay?

missed a line tonight.

00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,726
Forget it.

633

Courtney, would you please
drive me to Ben's house?

634

I forgot tonight.

bring it over here.

827
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:04,337
What took you so long?

828
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,033
Uh, I had to get gas.

829
00:54:06,143 --> 00:54:07,974
Have you been waiting out there
the whole time?

830
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,444
- Yeah.
- Oh.

831
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:11,536
Thanks.

832
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:12,876
Yeah.

833
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:17,244
Are we gonna go?

834
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:19,083
Oh, yeah, sure.

835
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,029
Ben?

836
00:54:38,142 --> 00:54:39,200
No, Mom, it's PBS.

837
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:40,799
You won some hemp tote bags.

838
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:42,435
- Please...
- Oh.

839
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:43,877
Hello.

840
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:46,415
Hey, what's going on?

841
00:54:46,517 --> 00:54:48,109
This is Johnny.

842
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:49,947
Johnny Drake?

843
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:51,850
Yes.

844
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,946
Oh, well,

845
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:56,116
very nice to meet you.

846
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:57,386
I'm Ruth Berger.

847
00:54:57,494 --> 00:55:00,554
It's nice to meet you too,
Mrs. Berger.

848
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:01,653
No, Ruth.

849
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:03,699
We're casual
around here.

850
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:06,395
So...

851
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:10,269
what are you guys up to?

852
00:55:10,374 --> 00:55:12,433
Uh, just hanging out.

853
00:55:12,543 --> 00:55:16,070
Uh, right.

854
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,841
Help yourself to snacks.

855
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:20,075
I have some really,
really good hot chocolate...

856
00:55:20,184 --> 00:55:21,378
with homemade marshmallows.

857
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,817
Okay, thanks.

858
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:24,910
Thanks, Mom.

859
00:55:25,022 --> 00:55:27,991
We're gonna
go upstairs now.

860
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:29,820
Come on.

861
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:35,595
It was
really nice to meet you...

862
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,496
Ruth.

863
00:55:37,601 --> 00:55:40,161
Yes, you too.

864
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,294
Dad and I are gonna watch...

865
00:55:41,405 --> 00:55:42,997
the new Ken Burns
documentary together...

866
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:44,767
on the downstairs TV
if you want to join.

867
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,602
Okay.

868
00:55:50,414 --> 00:55:51,938
Sorry about that.

869
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:54,017
No, she seems pretty cool.

870
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,427
Okay, you can stop looking
at my baby pictures now.

871
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,327
Sorry.

872
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:10,923
All baby pictures
look the same.

873
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:15,868
Yeah.

874
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,944
This is my room.

875
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,813
Hi.

876
00:56:28,919 --> 00:56:30,352
Hi.

877
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:37,154
Mm.

878
00:56:37,261 --> 00:56:38,888
Thanks for picking him up, Ben.

879
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:44,394
So you want to see my room?

880
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:46,332
I'm staying down the hall.

881
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:49,098
Well, do you want to watch TV?

882
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:52,300
With my parents?

883
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,434
Yeah.

884
00:57:04,288 --> 00:57:05,687
Anyone else
want some popcorn?

885
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:06,778
It's organic.

886
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:09,085
Oh, yeah.
Awesome.

887
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:34,008
Please do not take someone's
eye out in my living room.

888
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:09,578
Ben?

889
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:11,881
Uh, no.

890
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,581
Good morning.

891
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,317
Morning.

892
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:17,325
- Did you sleep well?
- Sorry I stayed.

893
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:19,190
It's not a problem.

894
00:58:19,296 --> 00:58:20,729
Would you like
something to eat?

895
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,959
I actually...

896
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:26,160
I kind of have a doctor's
appointment this morning.

897
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:28,430
Well, at least have a bagel.

898
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:31,564
I'll make it really quick,
and you can take it with you.

899
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:33,267
Okay.

900
00:58:36,113 --> 00:58:38,673
Um, is Ben coming down soon?

901
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:40,875
It's still a little early.

902
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:43,748
Oh.

903
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:45,219
Is the train station
near here?

904
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:47,222
Oh, you don't have a car.

905
00:58:47,324 --> 00:58:48,348
Well, I'll drive you then.

906
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,686
Oh, no,
you don't have to do that.

907
00:58:49,793 --> 00:58:51,818
Oh, Johnny,
it's not a problem.

908
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:53,793
I'm a mother.
We're prepared for these things.

909
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:55,797
I'll finish up your bagel,
and I'll swing you over.

910
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:57,059
Where's the office?

911
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:58,566
Haverford,
off of Montgomery.

912
00:58:58,668 --> 00:58:59,930
Not a problem.

913
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:01,197
We'll leave in one minute.

914
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,116
Ready?

915
00:59:21,091 --> 00:59:23,855
So, Johnny,
where do you live?

916
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:24,949
Gladwyne.

917
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:28,031
Has your family
lived there long?

918
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:30,065
It's just my dad
and my step mom.

919
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:32,658
I see.

920
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:37,970
And your mom?

921
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:41,511
What about her?

922
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:44,136
Did she...

923
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,908
Did she pass?

924
00:59:46,016 --> 00:59:47,005
No, she's alive.

925
00:59:47,117 --> 00:59:49,108
I just
don't see her anymore.

926
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:51,619
I'm sorry.

927
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,814
It's right up there
on the left.

928
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:03,496
When did they divorce?

929
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,660
When I was two.

930
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,931
That's very difficult.

931
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:24,312
I got to go.

932
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:26,082
Who's your doctor?

933
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:32,990
Dr. Mohr.

934
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:34,393
You're a therapist,
aren't you?

935
01:00:34,498 --> 01:00:37,092
Yeah.

936
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,827
Serena Mohr
is very good.

937
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:40,903
Yeah, my dad said
she's the best.

938
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:44,798
Hey, thanks for the ride.

939
01:00:44,908 --> 01:00:46,967
Oh, of course.

940
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:48,601
Please.

941
01:00:56,253 --> 01:00:59,245
Um, okay, bye.

942
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,589
I think I made a new friend.

943
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:10,529
Well, tell me about him.

944
01:01:10,634 --> 01:01:11,965
Her?

945
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:13,558
Him.

946
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:17,036
His name's Ben.

947
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,301
He's kind of a loser at school,
but he gave me a ride home,

948
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:20,967
and we made out
in my pool.

949
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:26,239
I'm not gay or anything.

950
01:01:28,552 --> 01:01:31,077
It's just, he was
looking at me in this way.

951
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:37,116
So I let him kiss me.

952
01:01:37,227 --> 01:01:39,889
What do you mean,
looking at you in this way?

953
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:41,554
I don't know.
It was like...

954
01:01:41,665 --> 01:01:43,360
It was like
he wasn't just looking at me,

955
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:46,958
but he was...

956
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,061
seeing something in me.

957
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:53,470
Does that sound weird?

958
01:01:53,577 --> 01:01:55,442
No.

959
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,740
How'd that make you feel?

960
01:01:57,847 --> 01:01:59,872
It felt good.

961
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:03,783
And...

962
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:05,377
Like, I could just feel-

963
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:08,821
I just knew
that he needed me to hug him.

964
01:02:11,328 --> 01:02:12,590
So I did.

965
01:02:12,696 --> 01:02:14,789
Mm-hmm.

966
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,559
And that...

967
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:19,601
like, felt cool,
I don't know.

968
01:02:19,703 --> 01:02:25,403
It's like...
It was like calm or something.

969
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:27,442
And then what happened?

970
01:02:30,447 --> 01:02:32,347
He said I was amazing.

971
01:02:32,449 --> 01:02:35,111
Whatever.

972
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:37,584
Why "whatever"?

973
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:40,679
It's funny, 'cause...

974
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:43,759
it never would've happened if
Alexa hadn't been such a bitch

975
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:46,556
and blown me off.

976
01:02:46,663 --> 01:02:48,187
She said
that she couldn't deal with me...

977
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:49,925
and she needed
to be alone.

978
01:02:50,033 --> 01:02:52,558
That doesn't sound like
she's totally blown you off.

979
01:02:52,669 --> 01:02:54,899
I mean...

980
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:58,099
everybody feels like they need
to be alone sometimes, right?

981
01:02:58,208 --> 01:02:59,937
I feel like I'm alone
all fucking day,

982
01:03:00,043 --> 01:03:02,034
at school, at home, in here.

983
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:06,980
It just felt nice...

984
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:09,313
to not feel alone,
you know?

985
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,779
I do.

986
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:20,826
Anyway, they're best friends,
Alexa and Ben.

987
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:23,524
It's just cool
the way they are together.

988
01:03:27,704 --> 01:03:31,504
It just felt good
to be looked at that way.

989
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:32,768
What do you think he meant...

990
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:36,312
when he said
he thought you were amazing?

991
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:41,477
Probably all bullshit,
right?

992
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:43,779
They're both just using me,
blah, blah, blah.

993
01:03:43,887 --> 01:03:44,979
Is that what you're saying?

994
01:03:45,088 --> 01:03:46,077
Not at all, Johnny.

I'm asking you
what you think.

996
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:03,232
I slept really well last night
for the first time...

01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,069
in a while,

998
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:08,167
at Ben's house.

999
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:10,610
The three of us just hung out,
me, Ben, Alexa.

We watched TV
with his parents.

1001
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,241
And you've been sexual
with both of them?

1002
01:04:21,758 --> 01:04:22,986
Yeah, so?

1003
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:26,961
Well, you refer to them
as your friends.

1004
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:29,224
Is that how they see you,
as a friend?

1005
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:31,766
Or do you think they
want something more from you?

1006
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,768
Listen,
nothing happened, okay?

1007
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,531
I just...

1008
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:37,162
We watched TV.
I fell asleep.

1009
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:38,501
They left me alone.

1010
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:40,098
And now
I actually feel kind of good,

1011
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,871
and you're trying to make it
all fucked up.

1012
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:44,242
I'm not trying to make it
all fucked up.

1013
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:46,008
I'm just saying,
things can get confusing...

1014
01:04:46,116 --> 01:04:47,708
when you're trying
to get on the same page...

1015
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:49,250
as the people
you care about.

1016
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:51,820
So I'm not worth
just being someone's friend...

1017
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:55,084
because I'm a piece of shit,
and they're both just using me?

1018
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:57,091
No, I just think, you know,
it would be helpful...

1019
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:59,218
to look at the whole picture.

1020

This is bullshit.

1021

You're always telling me
that I don't let anyone in.

1022
01:05:04,768 --> 01:05:06,668
So you should be cheering

stay at home last night.

1159
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:11,908
There we go.

1160
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:16,007
Night-night.

1161
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:18,712
Can we stop this?

1162
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:19,810
Stop what?

1163
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,014
Whatever this is,

1164
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:25,992
the game.

1165
01:14:26,095 --> 01:14:27,460
What do you want to do?

1166
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:28,552
I don't know.

1167
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:31,292
Just...

1168
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,733
be quiet.

1169
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:36,600
Okay.

1170
01:14:40,276 --> 01:14:42,267
Come with me.

1171
01:14:45,715 --> 01:14:48,309
Do you want to chill?

1172
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:49,679
Yeah.

1173
01:15:34,397 --> 01:15:38,094
Guys?

1174
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,600
No matter what happens,
I'm glad we're friends.

1175
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:47,031
And...

1176
01:15:47,143 --> 01:15:49,873
And I love you.

1177
01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:12,158
Okay.

1178
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:26,905
Hey, Ben, can I talk to you
for a second in private?

1179
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:30,484
What?

1180
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,178
Is something wrong?

1181
01:16:32,288 --> 01:16:33,778
No.

1182
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:37,256
Okay, just give us a sec,
all right?

1183
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:39,827
Just give us a sec.

1184
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:09,321
Hi.

1185
01:17:13,062 --> 01:17:15,189
You feeling okay?

1186
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,322
Yeah.

1187
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:22,531
I shouldn't
have let you alone.

1188
01:17:59,475 --> 01:18:02,535
[heavy breathing]

1189
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:31,639
Come on.

1190
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:37,670
Johnny.

1191
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:39,975
I want you
to be my first.

1192
01:18:40,082 --> 01:18:41,572
Ben, enough.

1193
01:18:41,684 --> 01:18:42,708
Stop it.

1194
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:43,807
He's not gay, okay?

1195
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:45,477
- Get over it.
- You get over it, Alexa.

1196
01:18:45,588 --> 01:18:46,748
You've gotten fucked enough.

1197
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:47,981
Leave him alone.
Move on.

1198
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:49,853
You're being disgusting,
do you know that?

1199
01:18:49,959 --> 01:18:51,256
You're acting
like a total faggot.

1200
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,384
The play's over, Alexa.

1201
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:53,859
Okay, you fucked,
and the scene worked.

1202
01:18:53,963 --> 01:18:54,952
Congratulations.

1203
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:56,053
Okay, okay, okay!

1204
01:18:56,165 --> 01:18:57,427
Just stop.
It's not like that.

1205
01:18:57,533 --> 01:18:59,398
You can be
a great homo.

1206
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,731
What are you, five years old?
Are you a child?

1207
01:19:01,837 --> 01:19:02,826
Go to college.

1208
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:04,371
Be an adolescent
for the first time.

1209
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:06,373
I'll be out in the real world
when you get out.

1210
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:07,533
What?

1211
01:19:07,643 --> 01:19:08,701
You're gonna be
at U-Penn.

1212
01:19:08,811 --> 01:19:09,800
Yeah.

1213
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:11,402
No, I deferred.

1214
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:13,378
I'm going to New York.

1215
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:15,006
I'm gonna be an actress.

1216
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:16,311
You're gonna be a waitress.

1217
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,443
Your parents
aren't gonna give you shit.

1218
01:19:18,554 --> 01:19:19,851
Wait, New York?

1219
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:21,115
I could totally be into that.

1220
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:22,212
What?

1221
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:23,985
No, seriously, I...

1222
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:26,027
I'll get a job or something,

1223
01:19:26,128 --> 01:19:27,891
and you could just act.

1224
01:19:27,997 --> 01:19:29,828
- Forget about her...
- Ben, will you settle down?

1225
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:33,595
Please, stop.

1226
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:35,670
Okay.

1227
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:38,433
I don't want
to go to college either.

1228
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,633
- Johnny, it's...
- No, look...

1229
01:19:40,743 --> 01:19:44,645
Let's just
go to New York together.

1230
01:19:44,747 --> 01:19:46,874
Wait.
Vassar's in New York,

1231
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:48,415
so Ben can come down
on the weekends,

1232
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:51,543
and we can all just...

1233
01:19:51,654 --> 01:19:53,246
be together.

1234
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:55,721
All three of us?

1235
01:19:55,824 --> 01:19:57,451
[laughs]

1236
01:19:57,559 --> 01:19:59,459
Like a big, happy family?

1237
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:01,859
It could be if...
I'm...

1238
01:20:01,964 --> 01:20:05,229
Why not, if we start over
and do it right?

1239
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:07,063
[laughs]

1240
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:21,572
That's not gonna happen.

1241
01:20:21,684 --> 01:20:24,482
Why not?

1242
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:34,257
It's not...
No, this is for real.

1243
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:42,569
Alex...
Ben?

1244
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:44,935
This is not bullshit.
We're friends.

1245
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,840
We care about each other.

1246
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:50,878
I trust you.

1247
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,918
thump!

1248
01:21:42,765 --> 01:21:46,599
[crying]

1249
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:01,177
[cork pops]

[liquid pouring]

1251
01:22:03,952 --> 01:22:06,512
We're so proud
of you guys.

1252
01:22:06,622 --> 01:22:08,180
So a toast.

1253
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:11,020
Oh, here, here.

1254
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:15,529
From nursery school
to the precipice of adulthood,

1255
01:22:15,631 --> 01:22:17,121
you guys made it,

1256
01:22:17,232 --> 01:22:19,462
alive and kicking.

1257
01:22:19,568 --> 01:22:23,004
Even though it may feel
like it's all over,

1258
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:26,597
I promise,
this is just the beginning.

1259
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:33,547
Cheers.

1260
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:45,651
Mm, are you going to answer
that invitation that I sent you...

1261
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:47,592
to the gala at Jefferson?

1262
01:22:47,696 --> 01:22:50,130
I am so sorry, dear,
but I completely forgot.

1263
01:22:50,232 --> 01:22:52,894
How are you?

1264
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:56,869
I'm okay, I guess.

1265
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:58,200
You?

1266
01:22:58,307 --> 01:22:59,365
I'm all right.

1267
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:02,000
I...

1268
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:05,944
I got this internship
at the PBS station downtown,

1269
01:23:06,048 --> 01:23:07,845
help with tech stuff.

1270
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,618
Have you heard anything about...

1271
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:16,213
Johnny?

1272
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:18,793
Not really.

1273
01:23:18,894 --> 01:23:20,885
Courtney said
Josh has been telling people...

1274
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,725
he went
into a mental institution.

1275
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:24,822
Serious?

1276
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:27,458
It's probably bullshit.

1277
01:23:32,241 --> 01:23:33,572
You excited about Penn?

1278
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:35,734
Dad's happy, so...

01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:39,280
Yeah.

1280
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:41,042
What are you doing
till school starts?

1281
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:42,309
Oh, Alexa, honey,

1282
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:44,214
would you go throw
some quarters in the meter?

1283
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:46,048
I completely forgot.

1284
01:23:46,154 --> 01:23:47,815
Sure.

1285
01:24:27,029 --> 01:24:28,553
Hi.

1286
01:24:33,168 --> 01:24:35,728
How are you?

1287
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:44,974
I didn't know...

1288
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,479
I mean, I thought you...

1289
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:53,887
You off to New York?

1290
01:24:56,825 --> 01:24:59,157
No.

1291
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:00,785
What about you?

1292
01:25:00,896 --> 01:25:02,158
Are you...

1293
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:06,796
I should go.

1294
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:10,632
Hey, Johnny?

1295
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:23,915
You look okay.

1296
01:25:29,091 --> 01:25:31,116
Hey, Johnny boy,
they're looking for you inside.

1297
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:32,250
Yeah, okay.

1298
01:25:35,097 --> 01:25:36,962
I got to go.

1299
01:25:49,077 --> 01:25:50,772
You in the ensemble?

1300
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:53,347
What?

1301
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:56,576
Oh, um...

1302
01:25:56,685 --> 01:25:59,017
No.

1303
01:25:59,121 --> 01:26:01,180
So who are you
supposed to be?

1304
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:09,462
[pulsing pop music]

1305
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:16,928
 

1306
01:26:18,707 --> 01:26:20,106
I get up on the town...

1307
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:21,641
A place
I don't even know...

1308
01:26:21,743 --> 01:26:24,678
I get up for the town...

1309
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,145
I run into you all...

1310
01:26:26,248 --> 01:26:27,738
Compromising my path...

1311
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:29,680
I run into you all...

1312
01:26:29,785 --> 01:26:34,119
And they tell me
the future looks bright...

1313
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:36,417
But today keeps saying...

1314
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:40,052
stay straight ahead
towards the light...

1315
01:26:42,397 --> 01:26:43,989
And who knows
if they're right...

1316
01:26:44,099 --> 01:26:45,657
I hope to God
that they are...

1317
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:48,793
'Cause it's all
that I have...

1318

Or believe in something
similar to a faith...

1319
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:54,000
in this goddamn town...

1320
01:26:54,109 --> 01:26:58,443
That it's all okay...

1321
01:26:58,547 --> 01:27:00,538
Baby, I'm not playing...

1322

Work for tonight
in today...

1323

All okay...

1325
01:27:10,459 --> 01:27:12,757
Look at who you are
because...

in the end...

I go out on the town...

1330
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:26,340
Love a lot,
sleep around...

1331
01:27:26,441 --> 01:27:27,806

my other self?

1332
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:29,877
Love a lot,
sleep around...

1333
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:34,347
And I know
that I've seen you before...

1334
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:36,417

Hurry up, come on...

And I'm sorry if you thought
that I'm someone else...

In this dark-filled room,

1340
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:52,532
Hurry up, drink,
drinking it down...

1341
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:54,158
That's all I'm gonna say...

1342

because it will work out
in the end...
