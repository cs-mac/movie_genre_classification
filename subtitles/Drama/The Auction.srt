1
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,558
THE AUCTION

2
00:02:39,644 --> 00:02:41,236
Come on, pal.

3
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:31,128
Need me today, Mr. Gagnon?

4
00:05:32,303 --> 00:05:36,138
You can clean out the pens
in the main barn, OK?

5
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:10,774
Morning, neighbour!

6
00:07:11,414 --> 00:07:14,076
Léo Savard's selling off his farm.

7
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:16,875
Interested?

8
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:20,884
You got company coming?

9
00:07:21,058 --> 00:07:23,891
My oldest, her husband and the kids.

10
00:07:24,462 --> 00:07:27,193
- And your other daughter?
- Frédérique?

11
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:30,433
With her, who knows?
I don't hear from her much.

12
00:07:30,602 --> 00:07:33,765
Maybe she'll show up and surprise me.

13
00:07:34,473 --> 00:07:36,066
But I doubt it.

14
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:39,303
Here. You'll have some dessert.

15
00:07:43,116 --> 00:07:45,745
That's nice of you. Thanks.

16
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,147
I let myself in. It was open.

17
00:08:15,952 --> 00:08:17,749
You're about to enter the 21st century!

18
00:08:18,523 --> 00:08:21,617
Gagnon & Sons is going high-tech.

19
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,193
Humanity's highest achievement
right here, Gaby.

20
00:08:26,531 --> 00:08:30,969
You can enter all your bills
and expenses as soon as they come in

21
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,465
and do your audit trail.

22
00:08:34,373 --> 00:08:36,638
It'll save you time and paperwork.

23
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:41,042
I'd rather you went on doing it for me.
It's already crowded here.

24
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:45,778
You'll see, Gaby. It's a cinch.

25
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:51,147
- How much do I owe you?
- Gaby, Gaby... It's repurposed.

26
00:08:51,726 --> 00:08:54,662
The kids at the youth centre refurbish them.

27
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,856
Dedicated bicycle thieves and gamers.

28
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:01,492
You should drop by.
This is the third one I've picked up.

29
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:05,698
The punk told me
they're for non-profit organizations only.

30
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,036
I said: " It's for a farm, you twit!

31
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:10,578
Any less of a profit,
and it'd be a charity!"

32
00:09:11,248 --> 00:09:14,706
He wants your company's
registration number.

33
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:18,218
That little punk
can take his number and shove it.

34
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,381
I'm unloading their junk
to help them out.

35
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:25,051
That's the last they'll see of me.
I'm done with community service.

36
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,895
The bullshit never ends.

37
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,201
We'll check later to see if it works.

38
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:40,946
The family still coming this weekend?

39
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:49,353
Good! That'll make this dad happy.

40
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:54,863
With them fancy city folk.

41
00:09:55,798 --> 00:09:57,629
How much for the computer?

42
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,631
I told you, it's free.

43
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,272
We gotta hook you up to the Net
so you can ogle naked girls.

44
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:11,547
What do you think?

45
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:18,881
Say hi to everyone for me.

46
00:10:19,057 --> 00:10:20,581
Need anything from the city?

47
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:23,057
No, I'm going into town later.

48
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:24,991
Call me if you get bored.

49
00:10:32,472 --> 00:10:33,962
Stay here, pal!

50
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,491
Hi!

51
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:55,964
Where's your husband?

52
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:59,033
He's swamped at work.
He couldn't make it.

53
00:13:59,836 --> 00:14:03,364
Well, well, well!
What do we have here?

54
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:06,342
Who are these two big boys?

55
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:10,705
I'll unbuckle you in a minute.

56
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,340
How are you?

57
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:18,182
You want to go see the sheep?

58
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:20,552
You haven't seen Grandpa in a while.

59
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,188
- I wanna go on the four-wheeler...
- We will.

60
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,161
I'll take the bags in, OK?

61
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:30,267
Want to hold him?

62
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:36,065
Sometimes he wiggles around a lot.

63
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:37,734
He won't hurt you.

64
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:42,541
You have to feed him this way.
Hold it up.

65
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:45,944
There. See?

66
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:03,435
Frédérique didn't want to come?

67
00:15:05,743 --> 00:15:09,201
Couldn't she afford the train?
I would've paid.

68
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,873
I offered her a ride,
but she never called back.

69
00:15:14,987 --> 00:15:17,217
It's like she doesn't want to see us.

70
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,451
Guess we're not important enough.

71
00:15:21,427 --> 00:15:23,987
- Do you ever see her?
- No more than you.

72
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:30,835
You both could try harder.
She should get to know her nephews.

73
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:33,166
You're sisters, just the two of you.

74
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,639
I'm out here,
but you're in the same city.

75
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,837
Not the same world, though.

76
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:43,574
She's always busy with her theatre friends.

77
00:15:43,752 --> 00:15:46,847
Me, it's the kids, our friends,
Steve's family.

78
00:15:47,523 --> 00:15:51,459
Do you ever see your relatives?
Your brothers?

79
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,021
You should make an effort.

80
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:59,659
Try to see each other.
Or at least touch base occasionally.

81
00:16:00,037 --> 00:16:01,868
That's easy enough.

82
00:16:09,514 --> 00:16:12,678
- Can I have more cake?
- Not tonight.

83
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:18,383
Let's go.

84
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:22,693
They'll get confused.

85
00:16:23,864 --> 00:16:26,298
No, they won't. Their dad's English.

86
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,690
I guess.

87
00:16:30,204 --> 00:16:32,035
So what's new here?

88
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:34,970
Nothing's new. It's all old.

89
00:16:37,211 --> 00:16:38,577
I'm getting lazy.

90
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,341
Lazy? Three days off in 40 years.

91
00:16:42,517 --> 00:16:45,884
I was lucky. It could've been two.

92
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:50,422
I haven't been here in months.
Something must've changed.

93
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:54,728
I don't know.
I lost a lamb this morning.

94
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:58,725
My neighbour bought a new tractor.
That's new.

95
00:17:00,905 --> 00:17:04,535
No idea how he'll pay for it.
The new ones cost a bundle.

96
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:09,574
You're better off
keeping the old clunkers going.

97
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:15,251
How's your husband?
How's business?

98
00:17:17,023 --> 00:17:20,425
He works a lot.
He's often out of town.

99
00:17:20,594 --> 00:17:24,121
He meets with potential investors...

100
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:26,263
a lot.

101
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,124
In Toronto?

102
00:17:28,602 --> 00:17:31,697
Toronto, Vancouver, New York.

103
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,869
He's on the road.

104
00:17:44,453 --> 00:17:46,786
- Who's outside?
- The Bouchard kid.

105
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:48,788
Irène and Jean-Marie's boy.

106
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:52,156
He does chores on weekdays.
It gives me a break.

107
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:53,627
It's Saturday.

108
00:17:53,797 --> 00:17:55,789
Yep, it's Saturday.

109
00:17:57,168 --> 00:18:00,433
I've tried telling the sheep,
but they don't get it.

110
00:18:04,142 --> 00:18:07,270
I asked him to come
so I could eat with you.

111
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:52,795
We'd be best friends in no time.

112
00:18:57,702 --> 00:19:00,136
I promised them each a lamb
if you moved back.

113
00:19:00,304 --> 00:19:01,794
Dad!

114
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:08,569
Want to go see the pond?
Let's walk to the pond.

115
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,341
You go. It's been fun.

116
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,475
Come on, let's go.

117
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:18,489
Grandpa wooed girls there
when he was young and handsome.

118
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,317
Come on!

119
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:29,069
We're gonna see some frogs.

120
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,372
I know where they are.

121
00:19:35,077 --> 00:19:38,070
- Where are they?
- In the pond.

122
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,501
You're leaving already?

123
00:21:10,816 --> 00:21:13,217
Wait until tomorrow.
You came all this way.

124
00:21:13,387 --> 00:21:16,322
It's a six-hour drive.
I'd rather head out.

125
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:19,856
Will you visit your mother?

126
00:21:20,027 --> 00:21:23,657
I saw her a little while ago.
She spent a week with us.

127
00:21:24,699 --> 00:21:28,965
- You could come to Montreal too.
- You know I can't.

128
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,704
We'll try to come back soon.

129
00:21:35,311 --> 00:21:36,903
Bye, sweetheart.

130
00:21:43,253 --> 00:21:45,744
You'll come back
and see the sheep, right?

131
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,721
I left Steve.

132
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:27,597
We've decided to separate.

133
00:24:31,441 --> 00:24:35,241
I wanted to tell you last week.
I just couldn't.

134
00:24:37,414 --> 00:24:41,044
I would have left long ago,
but I got pregnant with Thomas.

135
00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:47,347
I want to keep the house.

136
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:51,619
It's better for the boys.

137
00:24:56,269 --> 00:25:00,069
Steve doesn't want it.
He'll take the condo downtown.

138
00:25:03,142 --> 00:25:04,234
I need money.

139
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,445
To buy out his half.

140
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:14,285
Can't he just give you the house?

141
00:25:16,124 --> 00:25:19,287
He's in debt. He has to sell.

142
00:25:28,637 --> 00:25:30,468
Don't you have any savings?

143
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:34,572
I'm in debt too.

144
00:25:36,613 --> 00:25:39,947
We can't keep up with the payments.

145
00:25:40,351 --> 00:25:42,342
Isn't your house paid for?

146
00:25:42,687 --> 00:25:46,282
The cars, the house...
We don't own any of it.

147
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:55,124
I thought with your assets, the land...

148
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:57,833
you could take out a loan.

149
00:25:59,506 --> 00:26:01,497
I need about $200,000.

150
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:04,506
It's a lot, I know.

151
00:26:04,677 --> 00:26:07,772
I can pay you
when things are back to normal.

152
00:26:10,184 --> 00:26:12,982
Otherwise,
I'll feel like I'm back at square one.

153
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,648
I'm thinking of the boys.

154
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:22,024
I'm surprised.

155
00:26:22,865 --> 00:26:25,231
I thought you were fairly well off.

156
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:32,070
But why don't you move back here?

157
00:26:32,976 --> 00:26:35,137
There's room. I'll take care of you.

158
00:26:35,312 --> 00:26:37,974
Dad, I've told you a thousand times:

159
00:26:38,382 --> 00:26:40,248
We're not going to live here.

160
00:26:44,756 --> 00:26:46,348
A loan...

161
00:26:49,662 --> 00:26:52,358
I'm up to my eyeballs with the farm.

162
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,021
I'll see what I can do.

163
00:27:18,226 --> 00:27:22,026
I've helped your sister with her
rent enough times. It's your turn.

164
00:27:23,232 --> 00:27:26,599
Don't worry.
You need to keep the house, I know.

165
00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:32,708
I'll help you out.

166
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:38,446
I promise. I'll take care of you.

167
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:55,125
Mr. Gagnon, we've reviewed your file.

168
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,871
Unfortunately, your application was denied.

169
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,537
Your net annual income is $10,000.
You're close to retiring.

170
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:06,810
But I have the land as collateral.

171
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:09,916
You already have a loan
and a line of credit.

172
00:29:10,085 --> 00:29:13,077
Even with your land
and farming operation,

173
00:29:13,254 --> 00:29:15,553
we are unable to grant you a loan.

174
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,694
I think you suspected as much.

175
00:29:48,762 --> 00:29:51,253
Move, move, move!

176
00:31:04,345 --> 00:31:05,710
Hello?

177
00:31:06,682 --> 00:31:08,274
Hi, Marie.

178
00:31:14,056 --> 00:31:15,854
What about the boys?

179
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,527
Yes, I went to the bank.

180
00:31:29,573 --> 00:31:33,840
There's still some stuff to settle,
but I can get the money.

181
00:31:37,883 --> 00:31:39,407
Don't worry, OK?

182
00:31:39,584 --> 00:31:42,645
Things'll get better.
It's just a rough patch.

183
00:31:51,531 --> 00:31:53,089
I'll let you know.

184
00:31:54,401 --> 00:31:55,732
Bye, Marie.

185
00:32:36,982 --> 00:32:38,779
$300, gentlemen!

186
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,958
$325! $350!

187
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,990
400 bucks!

188
00:32:51,131 --> 00:32:53,497
$400! Who'll give $425?

189
00:32:53,634 --> 00:32:56,262
$500!
Do I hear $525?

190
00:32:56,403 --> 00:32:58,201
$525!
How about $550?

191
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,638
$550!
Anyone give me $575?

192
00:33:04,446 --> 00:33:06,574
$575! $600?

193
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,680
$600! $625?

194
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,846
$650? $650! $675?

195
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,515
$675!

196
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:17,627
$700, I have 700 bucks!

197
00:33:22,265 --> 00:33:25,997
Last offer $700!
Sold to the gentleman over there.

198
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,267
A bargain, gentlemen.

199
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:35,004
Do I hear $200 from anyone? $150?

200
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,343
$125, thank you.
Anyone want to give me $150?

201
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:43,780
$150! $175?

202
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:50,622
$175! How about $200?

203
00:33:53,868 --> 00:33:56,200
$200 for you.
Do I hear $225?

204
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,339
$225! $250?

205
00:33:58,507 --> 00:34:00,873
$250! Do I hear $275?

206
00:34:02,644 --> 00:34:04,976
$275! Do I hear $300?

207
00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:09,047
$300! Who'll give me $325?

208
00:34:12,388 --> 00:34:15,186
$325! $350? $350!

209
00:34:28,606 --> 00:34:30,403
Lots of people came out.

210
00:34:31,576 --> 00:34:33,067
Yep.

211
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,575
There comes a point in life

212
00:34:36,749 --> 00:34:39,946
when you have to hold a funeral
to see people.

213
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,256
I'm real happy to see you, Gaby.

214
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,097
Everybody's here. I'm glad.

215
00:34:51,766 --> 00:34:53,700
Got your eyes on anything?

216
00:34:57,972 --> 00:34:59,531
How you holding up?

217
00:35:02,144 --> 00:35:06,444
To tell you the truth,
I haven't slept much these past few days.

218
00:35:07,383 --> 00:35:09,078
But that'll change.

219
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:16,650
What'll you do now?

220
00:35:17,928 --> 00:35:19,555
We'll rest.

221
00:35:22,266 --> 00:35:23,824
We'll have to rest.

222
00:35:31,676 --> 00:35:35,010
Here's the heifer you've been waiting for.

223
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:38,150
A descendent of Starbuck, my friends.
Have a look.

224
00:35:38,317 --> 00:35:41,309
You've seen her mother
and grandmother at the shows.

225
00:35:41,488 --> 00:35:43,956
I'm sure we'll be seeing her too.

226
00:35:44,124 --> 00:35:46,319
She's just one year old.

227
00:35:46,493 --> 00:35:51,363
So who'll give me $1,500
to get the ball rolling? $1,400?

228
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:53,626
I've got $1,200. I'll take it.

229
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:01,167
$1,225! Who'll go $1,250?

230
00:36:04,213 --> 00:36:08,014
$1,275!
$1,300 for this magnificent creature!

231
00:36:09,352 --> 00:36:12,810
$1,400! No, $1,425!

232
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:14,354
Do I hear $1,450?

233
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:18,792
Turn her around. Have a good look
at the legs on this one!

234
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:20,828
$1,450! Do I hear $1,475?

235
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:26,068
$1,600! Who'll give me $1,625?

236
00:36:26,238 --> 00:36:29,298
$1,625! $1,650! $1,675!

237
00:36:29,474 --> 00:36:31,669
Do I hear $1,700? $1,700!

238
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:37,010
Gaby!

239
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:40,376
I'll be in the house!

240
00:38:50,198 --> 00:38:54,533
- So naked girls aren't your thing?
- Take it with you.

241
00:38:55,637 --> 00:38:58,162
It's just gathering dust.

242
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,574
I can't find this month's latest power bill.

243
00:39:04,848 --> 00:39:07,646
Top of the pile next to the green folders.

244
00:39:15,826 --> 00:39:17,385
I was wondering...

245
00:39:20,732 --> 00:39:23,257
How much could I get if I sold?

246
00:39:26,172 --> 00:39:27,764
Sold?

247
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,234
Sold what?

248
00:39:29,675 --> 00:39:31,506
If I sold off the farm.

249
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:35,514
Not you, Gaby.

250
00:39:35,682 --> 00:39:38,344
Just a rough estimate.

251
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:42,245
You know roughly how much.
Almost nothing.

252
00:39:48,296 --> 00:39:53,098
If you sell off the farm and everything on
it, and I mean everything...

253
00:39:54,303 --> 00:39:57,067
your herd, the land, even the house...

254
00:39:59,476 --> 00:40:01,637
Your land's worth something, but that's it.

255
00:40:01,812 --> 00:40:04,872
And it's not flat.
You can't take a crop off it.

256
00:40:05,282 --> 00:40:08,047
After you paid off your loan
and line of credit,

257
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:11,052
you'd have almost nothing left to retire on.

258
00:40:11,222 --> 00:40:15,215
It's not enough.
You farmers have nothing to fall back on.

259
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:19,796
On a guess,
I'd say things'll be tight once you retire.

260
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:23,157
Unless you're lucky and croak young.

261
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,132
And where would you go?

262
00:40:26,306 --> 00:40:28,171
No places to rent around here.

263
00:40:28,341 --> 00:40:30,571
And you in the city? No way!

264
00:40:31,411 --> 00:40:32,969
You can't afford to quit.

265
00:40:33,146 --> 00:40:36,480
You have to keep at it till you die,
like everyone else.

266
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:39,619
My brothers were smart to get out in time.

267
00:40:40,321 --> 00:40:42,813
What do you mean? You love it here!

268
00:40:43,492 --> 00:40:45,960
You've got your sheep.
The Bouchard boy helps out.

269
00:40:46,127 --> 00:40:47,822
I'd like to spoil my girls.

270
00:40:49,831 --> 00:40:52,494
So Marie asked you for money again?

271
00:41:04,615 --> 00:41:06,515
They are splitting up.

272
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:11,679
You never see them.

273
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,783
The girls don't need you anymore.

274
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:17,155
Your little princesses are all grown up.

275
00:41:18,631 --> 00:41:21,191
They have you wrapped around
their little fingers.

276
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:22,959
They're kids.

277
00:41:23,469 --> 00:41:25,164
You've done everything for them.

278
00:41:25,337 --> 00:41:26,965
You paid for everything...

279
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,234
their education and every little whim.

280
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,401
And you always went without.

281
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:34,480
You don't need to do that now.

282
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:38,381
I admire what you've done for them.

283
00:41:38,553 --> 00:41:41,522
But you can't go overboard.
Be reasonable.

284
00:41:41,689 --> 00:41:44,989
Reasonable?
They still need me, even at 30.

285
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,752
I'm still their father.

286
00:41:52,335 --> 00:41:55,429
OK. I've heard about enough.

287
00:41:55,872 --> 00:41:58,340
You can't sell. That's crazy talk.

288
00:41:58,508 --> 00:42:00,170
Not you, Gaby.

289
00:42:02,212 --> 00:42:05,181
Everyone else can sell, but not you.

290
00:42:10,522 --> 00:42:13,423
You have the nicest sheep farm around.

291
00:42:15,293 --> 00:42:17,091
Not a word to anyone, OK?

292
00:42:17,263 --> 00:42:19,026
Who would I tell?

293
00:42:20,866 --> 00:42:23,892
Enough of this. Time for a drink.

294
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,868
Here's to your farm, Gaby!

295
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,520
We're here.

296
00:43:53,036 --> 00:43:54,867
Right this way.

297
00:43:57,574 --> 00:44:00,168
This is the owner, my good friend Gaby.

298
00:44:00,344 --> 00:44:02,676
Hello. Welcome.

299
00:44:03,181 --> 00:44:05,046
You can pay Gaby directly,

300
00:44:05,216 --> 00:44:08,583
and then you can go in
and take your pick.

301
00:44:08,753 --> 00:44:11,018
But you have to pay him up front.

302
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,215
Did I say how much? Great.

303
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:15,189
So let's head inside.

304
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,421
We'll follow Gaby.
He'll show us the way.

305
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:23,893
This way. Go right on in.

306
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:36,340
That one?

307
00:44:54,037 --> 00:44:55,595
Is this one good?

308
00:45:49,165 --> 00:45:52,658
More than a dozen families
have moved into town.

309
00:45:53,804 --> 00:45:58,036
They've been hired to clear underbrush.
Hard work doesn't scare 'em.

310
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:02,172
They pay cash. Nice!

311
00:46:02,614 --> 00:46:06,015
I took them to Jean-Marie's slaughterhouse.

312
00:46:06,184 --> 00:46:08,846
When he saw the priest with that knife

313
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:12,013
and his whole delegation -
maybe 25 of them...

314
00:46:12,191 --> 00:46:13,954
Poor Jean-Marie!

315
00:46:14,126 --> 00:46:16,492
He wanted to kill the ewe
with his baseball bat!

316
00:46:16,662 --> 00:46:19,860
They were horrified, you can imagine!

317
00:46:22,636 --> 00:46:26,471
You should've seen it:
Babe Ruth and the Muslims!

318
00:46:31,913 --> 00:46:34,575
So I can make this a regular thing.

319
00:46:34,716 --> 00:46:36,548
I'd be glad to help.

320
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:41,418
No. I'm happy we did it,
but once is enough.

321
00:46:41,724 --> 00:46:44,853
The law says
if you slaughter an animal yourself,

322
00:46:45,028 --> 00:46:47,724
you can buy directly from the farm,
no middleman.

323
00:46:48,565 --> 00:46:51,693
We can do it legally.
All aboveboard.

324
00:46:52,068 --> 00:46:53,502
Make some cash.

325
00:46:53,905 --> 00:46:55,736
It doesn't pay.

326
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:25,897
Everything all right?

327
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:31,106
I have some errands to run in town.

328
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:05,547
Mr. Gagnon?
Thanks for agreeing to see me.

329
00:50:14,161 --> 00:50:17,562
Is it too late for breakfast?
I'd like some breakfast.

330
00:50:20,068 --> 00:50:23,060
Right, I'll start by giving you my card.

331
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:24,760
There.

332
00:50:29,812 --> 00:50:33,270
So, we're here today

333
00:50:33,482 --> 00:50:37,112
to do an initial evaluation
of your establishment,

334
00:50:37,287 --> 00:50:40,154
so you know what your assets are worth

335
00:50:40,323 --> 00:50:43,986
and to consider some tax-related questions.

336
00:50:44,161 --> 00:50:45,857
I'll also tell you about my team.

337
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:50,967
We take over,
prepare the herd and your machinery

338
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:53,000
so you get top dollar.

339
00:50:53,172 --> 00:50:55,834
We do all the advertising,

340
00:50:56,008 --> 00:50:58,841
the auction notice,
the website and the catalogue.

341
00:50:59,011 --> 00:51:02,504
We put together the catalogue,
the inventory and so forth.

342
00:51:03,449 --> 00:51:05,542
We believe your life's work

343
00:51:05,718 --> 00:51:08,710
should be entrusted
to a team of professionals.

344
00:51:10,491 --> 00:51:11,480
So...

345
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:41,148
Gaby!

346
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,768
What the hell is this?

347
00:52:50,935 --> 00:52:53,769
You went ahead on your own?
An auction?

348
00:52:55,608 --> 00:53:00,170
"Gagnon & Sons Farm Auction.
Land, home and equipment.

349
00:53:00,479 --> 00:53:04,246
"Everyone welcome.
1214 Rural Route 3."

350
00:53:05,452 --> 00:53:08,910
You're selling it all off, Gaby?
Have you gone crazy?

351
00:53:10,157 --> 00:53:14,822
Your home! Your father's land!
Your goddamn sheep, Gaby!

352
00:53:16,631 --> 00:53:18,326
Where will you go?

353
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,463
Where will you go!

354
00:53:23,439 --> 00:53:26,033
Here's your goddamn farming newsletter!

355
00:53:28,845 --> 00:53:30,312
Calm down.

356
00:53:32,515 --> 00:53:34,881
I have to find an apartment.

357
00:53:44,795 --> 00:53:47,788
I told you,
don't leave your junk in the hallway!

358
00:53:47,966 --> 00:53:51,868
Put your crap away!
I won't warn you again.

359
00:54:01,881 --> 00:54:03,372
This is it.

360
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,557
Here's the bedroom.

361
00:54:22,671 --> 00:54:25,572
It has to be cleaned and repainted.

362
00:54:25,741 --> 00:54:29,269
The tenants left yesterday.
It hasn't been fixed up yet.

363
00:54:29,446 --> 00:54:32,540
There were eight of them.
A bunch of kids from up north.

364
00:54:32,716 --> 00:54:34,513
Took off without paying.

365
00:54:34,684 --> 00:54:36,015
It's always the same.

366
00:54:36,186 --> 00:54:39,588
Either they skip out,
get kicked out or die.

367
00:54:39,757 --> 00:54:41,725
Same difference, anyway.

368
00:54:41,893 --> 00:54:45,056
None of them come back
to apologize or pay up!

369
00:54:46,265 --> 00:54:48,529
Look! They left all their empties.

370
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:52,033
At least I can turn them in for the deposit.

371
00:54:53,071 --> 00:54:54,437
So that's that.

372
00:54:54,607 --> 00:54:59,067
If you decide to take it,
I'll need references.

373
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:05,116
I'm calling about the apartment for rent.

374
00:55:05,286 --> 00:55:07,948
Is that per month or per week?

375
00:55:09,457 --> 00:55:11,153
Are you nuts?

376
00:55:11,326 --> 00:55:14,056
That's not exactly a palace
you've got there.

377
00:55:14,563 --> 00:55:18,397
Jesus, is there a pool or something
that's not in the photo?

378
00:55:18,767 --> 00:55:21,669
Thing you're god's gift?
What's your name?

379
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:24,602
I'm not threatening,
I'm asking your name.

380
00:55:25,107 --> 00:55:27,905
Want me to come over?
Give me the address!

381
00:55:28,077 --> 00:55:29,773
Right. Screw you!

382
00:55:37,922 --> 00:55:41,790
There's not much at that price.
I'm out of ideas.

383
00:55:42,527 --> 00:55:46,157
Why are you looking at dumps like this?
You're not some dog.

384
00:55:46,332 --> 00:55:49,631
There's a place on the highway
near the bridge.

385
00:55:49,802 --> 00:55:51,929
That's an old folks' home!

386
00:55:52,104 --> 00:55:55,006
No, it's not. It's social housing.

387
00:55:55,175 --> 00:55:57,666
With old people in it.
So it's an old folks' home.

388
00:55:57,844 --> 00:55:59,812
Well, that's convenient. I am old.

389
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:02,882
Just until I find something better.

390
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:05,678
The apartments are no different.
See?

391
00:56:05,853 --> 00:56:08,617
They take people 50 and up
and it'll be clean.

392
00:56:08,789 --> 00:56:10,984
Until I find work in town.

393
00:56:11,158 --> 00:56:13,684
Why not check in to the cemetery now?

394
00:56:13,862 --> 00:56:16,854
I'm not going.
My wife's waiting for me.

395
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:19,030
She'll think I'm having an affair

396
00:56:19,201 --> 00:56:24,003
'cause I'm hanging out
with a 63-year-old has-been.

397
00:56:38,723 --> 00:56:41,385
Keep an eye on him.
Don't let him run off.

398
00:56:55,776 --> 00:56:58,336
We had a common room,
but no one used it,

399
00:56:58,512 --> 00:57:00,036
so we closed it up.

400
00:57:01,014 --> 00:57:02,777
No common room.

401
00:57:03,751 --> 00:57:05,616
Just private apartments.

402
00:57:06,754 --> 00:57:08,244
Here it is.

403
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:18,926
This is the kind of unit we have.

404
00:57:19,301 --> 00:57:21,293
Got any kids, Mr. Gagnon?

405
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:23,439
Yes. Two daughters.

406
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:26,272
They won't visit you here.

407
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:27,771
They'll come at first,

408
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:30,209
but all of a sudden they'll stop.

409
00:57:30,381 --> 00:57:34,283
I want to be straight.
It won't be any different for you.

410
00:57:36,153 --> 00:57:38,486
When a car pulls up here, it's a big event.

411
00:57:40,792 --> 00:57:43,454
You look too sturdy to be moving here.

412
00:57:43,629 --> 00:57:47,259
It's temporary,
until things get back to normal.

413
00:57:50,603 --> 00:57:53,071
Are the neighbours quiet?

414
00:57:53,306 --> 00:57:56,242
Hard to get any quieter.

415
00:57:57,845 --> 00:58:02,248
You must be wondering
what that musty smell is.

416
00:58:03,518 --> 00:58:06,976
The lady before
never opened her door or windows.

417
00:58:07,822 --> 00:58:10,188
I can't stand that smell.

418
00:58:13,496 --> 00:58:18,490
- What did you use to do?
- Sheep farmer.

419
00:58:18,701 --> 00:58:24,334
So you must be used to shut-in smells.

420
00:58:24,975 --> 00:58:27,034
By sheep, you mean lambs?

421
00:58:29,847 --> 00:58:33,840
Well, I can show you
the other units if you want,

422
00:58:34,018 --> 00:58:36,179
but trust me, they're all the same.

423
00:58:36,354 --> 00:58:39,051
No need, I've made up my mind.

424
00:58:40,292 --> 00:58:43,659
I'll take this one,
with the window and the balcony.

425
00:59:01,215 --> 00:59:02,705
It's done.

426
00:59:05,253 --> 00:59:06,743
Bravo.

427
01:01:37,656 --> 01:01:39,852
I saw the "For Sale" sign.

428
01:01:45,098 --> 01:01:47,590
Are you selling the house or the farm?

429
01:01:48,269 --> 01:01:49,896
Everything.

430
01:01:52,573 --> 01:01:55,337
Why? Interested?

431
01:01:56,912 --> 01:01:59,039
Of course I'm interested.

432
01:02:02,851 --> 01:02:05,252
Are you buying or just snooping?

433
01:02:26,544 --> 01:02:28,944
You can't up and sell the farm!

434
01:02:30,215 --> 01:02:32,775
You should have talked to us first!

435
01:03:19,436 --> 01:03:21,701
I have to get rid of my dog.

436
01:03:25,777 --> 01:03:27,836
Any chance you'd take him?

437
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:32,014
I can't. I've already got mine.

438
01:03:32,184 --> 01:03:34,880
And they don't get along.

439
01:03:38,024 --> 01:03:40,289
I can't put him down.

440
01:03:41,828 --> 01:03:43,489
Ridiculous, huh?

441
01:03:45,232 --> 01:03:48,225
I've done it plenty of times,
but this time I can't.

442
01:03:57,546 --> 01:04:01,880
You know, François talked about you
the day before he died.

443
01:04:04,086 --> 01:04:06,180
Before he pulled that stunt.

444
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:10,887
He said you still
walked your land every day,

445
01:04:11,061 --> 01:04:13,326
that you never stopped doing it.

446
01:04:16,667 --> 01:04:20,569
He would've been sad to see you leaving,

447
01:04:21,238 --> 01:04:23,673
selling off such a beautiful farm.

448
01:04:27,245 --> 01:04:29,770
He loved your farm.
I think he was jealous.

449
01:04:37,757 --> 01:04:41,125
I don't know how
I'm gonna manage on my own.

450
01:04:45,766 --> 01:04:49,294
You should hire the Bouchard boy.
I'd be grateful.

451
01:04:50,405 --> 01:04:52,032
He's a good worker, reliable.

452
01:04:52,207 --> 01:04:54,402
You won't feel so alone.

453
01:04:57,079 --> 01:04:59,741
And I'd be glad to think
I found him another job.

454
01:05:02,251 --> 01:05:03,946
OK, I'll call him.

455
01:05:45,866 --> 01:05:47,493
Come on!

456
01:06:11,962 --> 01:06:13,453
Yes?

457
01:06:15,333 --> 01:06:18,166
- Is it for this dog?
- Yes.

458
01:06:19,637 --> 01:06:21,070
Is he sick?

459
01:06:21,873 --> 01:06:23,671
Is there some other problem?

460
01:06:24,343 --> 01:06:25,867
How old is he?

461
01:06:27,046 --> 01:06:28,070
Ten.

462
01:06:29,682 --> 01:06:32,151
- To euthanize him?
- Yes.

463
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,877
It's $25.

464
01:06:36,523 --> 01:06:37,751
How do you do it?

465
01:06:38,191 --> 01:06:41,719
Gas cylinder. Takes about 15 seconds.

466
01:06:42,063 --> 01:06:45,226
I'll take him out back.
I'll do it at 3:00.

467
01:06:51,573 --> 01:06:53,234
It's $25.

468
01:07:50,839 --> 01:07:53,069
Give him to me.

469
01:09:06,858 --> 01:09:09,520
Dad left the land to all three of us.

470
01:09:10,194 --> 01:09:12,492
It's the only thing he left us.

471
01:09:13,898 --> 01:09:15,924
All we got was Mom's silverware.

472
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:26,235
You've been earning a living
here on Dad's land for 40 years.

473
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:28,509
That's perfectly fine.

474
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:32,251
But now, if you sell it...

475
01:09:34,255 --> 01:09:36,780
we think we deserve a share.

476
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:41,593
It wouldn't be fair for you to keep it all.

477
01:09:47,769 --> 01:09:50,933
I've run this place by myself for 40 years.

478
01:09:51,107 --> 01:09:52,768
You wanted nothing to do with it.

479
01:09:52,942 --> 01:09:55,604
You left me to take care of everything.

480
01:09:55,778 --> 01:09:57,576
You were happy I took over.

481
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:04,244
You don't know what hard work
and sacrifice mean.

482
01:10:05,622 --> 01:10:07,147
You've never been around,

483
01:10:07,325 --> 01:10:09,885
never lost a moment's sleep
over the farm.

484
01:10:10,061 --> 01:10:12,996
It's none of your business.
Just leave me alone!

485
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,098
- Go away.
- Don't be like that, Gaby.

486
01:10:17,269 --> 01:10:19,499
I said get out!

487
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:20,929
Thank you.

488
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:32,112
- How are you?
- Fine.

489
01:12:33,955 --> 01:12:35,479
How about you?

490
01:12:40,095 --> 01:12:41,495
Can I help you?

491
01:12:41,931 --> 01:12:46,834
It's for Frédérique.
I was wondering what to get her.

492
01:12:47,803 --> 01:12:49,669
She doesn't wear jewellery.

493
01:12:50,307 --> 01:12:52,298
I thought maybe a watch.

494
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:55,805
Women's wristwatches are over here.

495
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:03,478
This one? Which one do you like?

496
01:13:05,256 --> 01:13:08,590
This one's more understated.
It's more her style.

497
01:13:09,194 --> 01:13:12,652
- Doesn't she have a watch?
- I don't know.

498
01:13:13,866 --> 01:13:15,494
This one's pretty.

499
01:13:15,835 --> 01:13:18,599
I'll take it. It's nice.

500
01:13:31,852 --> 01:13:33,980
Shall I gift-wrap it?

501
01:13:36,825 --> 01:13:38,190
You're going to wrap it?

502
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,852
I can do it.

503
01:13:41,664 --> 01:13:43,154
If you want to.

504
01:14:07,059 --> 01:14:09,550
You drove a half-hour just for this?

505
01:14:09,729 --> 01:14:11,162
I wanted to talk.

506
01:14:13,099 --> 01:14:14,259
Talk?

507
01:14:15,235 --> 01:14:17,726
Can we go somewhere more private?

508
01:14:19,206 --> 01:14:20,230
Now?

509
01:14:21,241 --> 01:14:22,538
If you can.

510
01:14:22,943 --> 01:14:26,038
I have to stay here.
André's busy in the back.

511
01:14:28,249 --> 01:14:32,208
I'll call you then.
Yes, it's better that way.

512
01:14:33,055 --> 01:14:34,283
The watch!

513
01:14:34,456 --> 01:14:35,946
Right, the watch.

514
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:00,111
I'm selling the farm.

515
01:15:06,658 --> 01:15:09,287
Still have that old sweater?

516
01:15:09,562 --> 01:15:12,122
I never wear it, so it's like new.

517
01:15:12,732 --> 01:15:14,632
My clothes never get worn out.

518
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,905
Do you see the girls very often?

519
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:23,401
I saw Marie a little while ago.
How about you?

520
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:27,740
I see them whenever I go to Montreal.

521
01:15:27,916 --> 01:15:29,406
Pretty often.

522
01:15:29,584 --> 01:15:31,518
I talk to them on the phone.

523
01:15:32,688 --> 01:15:34,918
I saw Frédérique in a play.

524
01:15:36,992 --> 01:15:38,186
She's really good.

525
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,999
What got into you?

526
01:15:50,174 --> 01:15:52,472
What did the girls have to say?

527
01:15:52,643 --> 01:15:57,342
The girls? If they had anything to say,
they should've spoken up sooner.

528
01:15:58,015 --> 01:16:01,179
They don't know yet.
And I don't want you to tell them.

529
01:16:01,353 --> 01:16:03,287
The farm means nothing to them.

530
01:16:03,889 --> 01:16:06,449
They're busy with their own lives.

531
01:16:07,026 --> 01:16:08,891
Frédérique might care.

532
01:16:09,462 --> 01:16:11,828
Frédérique? I never hear from her!

533
01:16:12,866 --> 01:16:14,834
What about your nephew Marc?

534
01:16:15,001 --> 01:16:16,799
Marc? He couldn't care less!

535
01:16:16,971 --> 01:16:19,963
I encouraged him,
but he's just like his dad.

536
01:16:22,309 --> 01:16:24,335
And my other brother...

537
01:16:26,147 --> 01:16:28,877
You always said a farm
should be passed down, not sold.

538
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:31,848
Sure, but nobody wants it, Françoise!

539
01:16:36,225 --> 01:16:37,886
Nobody wants it.

540
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:45,228
You should've talked to them.
I did everything I could. I tried.

541
01:16:49,406 --> 01:16:52,240
You can still live in the house.

542
01:16:52,710 --> 01:16:56,339
I'm selling that too. I have to.

543
01:16:58,550 --> 01:17:00,518
I'm renting an apartment.

544
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:05,281
- An apartment?
- A little one-bedroom place.

545
01:17:05,457 --> 01:17:08,859
I'm going to try
and find work here in town.

546
01:17:15,535 --> 01:17:17,094
Why did you come?

547
01:17:21,776 --> 01:17:23,869
I want us to get back together.

548
01:17:32,154 --> 01:17:36,114
Have your lost your mind?
In your apartment?

549
01:17:37,994 --> 01:17:39,461
I'm with André.

550
01:17:39,629 --> 01:17:41,460
Remember André, my husband?

551
01:17:41,632 --> 01:17:43,099
I'm your husband.

552
01:17:47,438 --> 01:17:49,565
Get back together?

553
01:17:50,508 --> 01:17:53,306
I hope that's not why
you're selling the farm!

554
01:17:53,478 --> 01:17:56,606
Good gosh, we split up 20 years ago!

555
01:17:56,781 --> 01:17:58,943
I've moved on.

556
01:18:04,657 --> 01:18:06,318
Honestly!

557
01:18:07,461 --> 01:18:09,088
I have to go.

558
01:18:18,673 --> 01:18:22,666
I don't know what you'll do
without your farm. I don't get it.

559
01:18:34,057 --> 01:18:36,150
Is the lady coming back?

560
01:20:04,324 --> 01:20:05,951
Dad?

561
01:20:08,729 --> 01:20:10,253
Dad?

562
01:20:54,647 --> 01:20:56,774
Your friend Louis called me.

563
01:20:58,017 --> 01:21:00,851
He said maybe I should come see you.

564
01:21:08,896 --> 01:21:10,796
Why are you doing it?

565
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:16,866
Is it Marie?
Did she ask you for money?

566
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:22,467
Does she know?

567
01:21:23,912 --> 01:21:25,574
I didn't tell her.

568
01:21:26,983 --> 01:21:28,974
I don't want her to know.

569
01:21:30,753 --> 01:21:32,584
She'd feel terrible.

570
01:21:42,701 --> 01:21:45,431
When your mother and I got married,

571
01:21:47,672 --> 01:21:50,197
we said my dad's farm would be there

572
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:54,676
to get us over any bumps in the road,

573
01:21:55,448 --> 01:21:57,916
the tough times in life.

574
01:22:00,087 --> 01:22:02,021
It brought us such happiness.

575
01:22:05,259 --> 01:22:10,095
And we thought it would be there
for you and Marie.

576
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:21,474
But thinking back, I realize
that all the problems I've had in life

577
01:22:21,644 --> 01:22:23,874
are because of this farm.

578
01:22:24,046 --> 01:22:25,377
You understand?

579
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:30,783
First my brothers left.

580
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:37,890
Then your mother.
Because of the farm.

581
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:40,995
She couldn't stand it.

582
01:22:42,668 --> 01:22:44,499
She was suffocating.

583
01:22:47,506 --> 01:22:50,134
And then you two left.

584
01:22:58,184 --> 01:23:01,780
Gagnon & Sons kept me up
every single night.

585
01:23:04,158 --> 01:23:06,626
It did its best to make me miserable,

586
01:23:07,294 --> 01:23:09,786
to make me feel guilty.

587
01:23:14,469 --> 01:23:17,496
But it's my farm, and nobody else's.

588
01:23:18,808 --> 01:23:20,469
It kept me here.

589
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:24,843
It's been dragging me down all my life.

590
01:23:31,221 --> 01:23:35,454
Now, it's my turn to get my due,
what I'm owed.

591
01:23:39,530 --> 01:23:44,366
I never had any sons to help me out,
but I have two daughters I love.

592
01:23:49,408 --> 01:23:53,903
Everyone always said that my life
was my farm, my land.

593
01:23:57,650 --> 01:23:59,709
But they were all wrong.

594
01:24:04,925 --> 01:24:08,657
My life is my children.
It's you two.

595
01:24:14,569 --> 01:24:18,563
Fathers need to give to be happy.
We're like that.

596
01:24:22,678 --> 01:24:27,412
I want you to live your life
the way you want to, that's all.

597
01:24:34,759 --> 01:24:39,059
Your sister needs money.
I thought this would be best.

598
01:24:40,365 --> 01:24:42,299
Marie's taking advantage of you.

599
01:24:43,936 --> 01:24:45,699
I know.

600
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,908
She's always been like that.

601
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:54,707
She can take advantage of me.
I don't mind.

602
01:24:57,117 --> 01:24:59,585
I'm proud of you two, you know.

603
01:25:00,555 --> 01:25:04,252
I'm glad you got out of here
and did something else.

604
01:25:05,326 --> 01:25:09,457
I don't want you to give up acting,
or the big city.

605
01:25:09,631 --> 01:25:14,330
- You've never even seen me on stage, Dad!
- Not because I didn't want to.

606
01:25:16,338 --> 01:25:17,806
Now I can go see you.

607
01:25:18,508 --> 01:25:20,408
The auction is tomorrow.

608
01:25:21,811 --> 01:25:24,279
I'm selling the herd, the buildings,

609
01:25:24,447 --> 01:25:26,814
the equipment and machinery, the house.

610
01:25:26,984 --> 01:25:28,679
I don't want any of it.

611
01:25:31,655 --> 01:25:33,418
Now I can come to Montreal.

612
01:25:37,996 --> 01:25:39,987
Going home already?

613
01:25:43,336 --> 01:25:45,099
There's no rush.

614
01:25:45,304 --> 01:25:47,329
I can stay a day or two.

615
01:25:48,508 --> 01:25:50,305
All week if you want.

616
01:28:00,821 --> 01:28:05,350
The Texels you see here,
the 3-year-old ewes,

617
01:28:05,527 --> 01:28:09,156
are guaranteed pregnant since September.

618
01:28:09,364 --> 01:28:14,302
There are eight ewes in all.
We're selling them individually.

619
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:18,339
How much do I hear for these fine ewes?
Who'll give me $200?

620
01:28:18,509 --> 01:28:20,977
I've got $100 to start.
Anybody say $125?

621
01:28:24,181 --> 01:28:26,274
$125! Do I hear $150?

622
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:30,317
$150! Do I hear $175?

623
01:28:30,488 --> 01:28:33,685
We're still at $150, boys.
They're worth so much more!

624
01:28:33,858 --> 01:28:37,124
$175! Do I hear $200, folks?

625
01:28:37,296 --> 01:28:40,891
$200! $225?
Do I hear $210 then?

626
01:28:41,067 --> 01:28:42,625
$210! $220?

627
01:28:44,871 --> 01:28:46,498
$220! $230...

628
01:28:57,885 --> 01:29:01,720
$260, guys.
That's too low for purebreds like these!

629
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:03,721
$260! Do I hear $260?

630
01:29:08,097 --> 01:29:09,621
$270! Do I hear 280$?

631
01:29:11,034 --> 01:29:12,524
$300, thank you!

632
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:17,066
I have $300 for the ewe.
Do I hear $310?

633
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:20,540
If nobody can top $300,
that's gonna be the end of it!

634
01:29:20,711 --> 01:29:23,703
Sold! $300 for the ewes right here, folks!

635
01:29:23,881 --> 01:29:27,215
OK! Bring me the next lot, boys.
We're ready!

636
01:29:44,404 --> 01:29:46,099
Louis bought something.

637
01:29:51,111 --> 01:29:53,376
To make you happy, I bet.

638
01:29:53,782 --> 01:29:55,579
My blue compressor.

639
01:29:57,118 --> 01:30:00,554
He's wanted it for a long time.
He kept asking for it.

640
01:30:14,137 --> 01:30:16,105
They sold the herd.

641
01:32:43,570 --> 01:32:45,801
Where are you gonna put all this?

642
01:32:45,974 --> 01:32:48,499
I'm renting a storage locker in town.

643
01:32:48,676 --> 01:32:50,644
For most of the furniture.

644
01:32:50,812 --> 01:32:53,007
My apartment's pretty small.

645
01:32:53,181 --> 01:32:54,945
Your apartment...

646
01:33:03,626 --> 01:33:05,253
You have a computer?

647
01:33:05,428 --> 01:33:07,988
Louis brought it. I don't use it.

648
01:33:08,798 --> 01:33:10,994
- Does it work?
- I don't know.

649
01:35:30,824 --> 01:35:34,351
I'll come see you in Montreal.
Promise.

650
01:35:40,835 --> 01:35:43,702
I bought you a present.

651
01:35:43,871 --> 01:35:46,432
A watch.
You can open it on the train.

652
01:35:49,978 --> 01:35:51,673
A watch?

653
01:35:56,019 --> 01:35:57,782
How did it go?

654
01:36:02,058 --> 01:36:03,651
Not great is an understatement.

655
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:17,104
I'm here for my new compressor.

656
01:38:54,183 --> 01:38:57,017
Pleasure doing business with you.

657
01:39:00,557 --> 01:39:02,548
Call me if you get bored.

658
01:40:19,479 --> 01:40:20,970
Come on, pal.

659
01:42:06,265 --> 01:42:08,893
We received the papers
from your real estate agent

660
01:42:09,068 --> 01:42:11,298
and the offer on the land.

661
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:14,531
The papers for the loan
are all ready to sign.

662
01:42:14,708 --> 01:42:17,142
My daughter should be here any minute.

663
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:18,777
She called earlier.

664
01:42:18,945 --> 01:42:22,279
She was held up,
so we made other arrangements.

665
01:42:22,450 --> 01:42:25,385
We'll fax the documents
so she can sign them.

666
01:42:25,553 --> 01:42:28,215
No need for her to come all this way.

667
01:42:31,493 --> 01:42:35,623
Here we go.
I just need you to sign here.

668
01:42:43,573 --> 01:42:45,063
And here.

669
01:42:51,081 --> 01:42:53,106
Your initials here.

670
01:51:28,692 --> 01:51:31,388
