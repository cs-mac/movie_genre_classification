0
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,314
Jerk it back, Gramps!

1
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,072
Pull!

2
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,037
What's that?

3
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,989
Nothin', just a piece of wood.

4
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,350
Damn!

5
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,436
What happened?

6
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,189
The propeller's bent!

7
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,598
Dad!

8
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,032
What happened?

9
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,558
The propeller has to be changed
and the boat's all rotted.

10
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,476
We'll get 100,000.

11
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,069
If we demolish it,
we'll get 100,000 euros!

12
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,033
When will you earn that
with this work?

13
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,673
Dad, see how good
the old people in town live?

14
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,431
They go fishing, they have fun

15
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,676
and put their money in the bank.

16
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,599
You're the last one doing this work.

17
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,275
Sermon over?
Go take a nice walk.

18
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,632
Okay, bye!

19
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,117
Rest in peace.

20
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,958
On behalf of
my daughter-in-law Giulietta,

21
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,551
my grandson Filippo,
my son Nino and his wife Maria,

22
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,558
I thank all my relatives and friends

23
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,150
for coming together
in memory of my son Pietro,

24
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,555
who disappeared
at sea three years ago.

25
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,070
Filippo, you look good
inside this suit, you know?

26
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,150
I remember it on your father.

27
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,757
You're just alike.

28
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,031
Take care, okay?

29
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,792
Whose scooter is that?

30
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,431
It's even got the keys.

31
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,477
Try starting it up.

32
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,109
It starts.

33
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,390
- Ride it, you know how?
- Sure.

34
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,756
- Nice, like it?
- Yeah, a lot!

35
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,393
Take it, it's yours.

36
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,795
- Mine?
- Yours!

37
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,439
Thanks, Uncle!

38
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,358
Go on, take it for a ride.

39
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,870
Go, Filippo, take off!

40
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,035
Okay, I'm off to work, bye.

41
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,639
Bye, Dad.

42
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,755
How about coffee? Like to come in?

43
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,198
That kid seems a little rudderless.

44
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,519
Let Filippo spend more time with me,
please...

45
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,231
Filippo spends time
with whoever he likes.

46
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,838
Maria, let's go?

47
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,152
Bye, honey.

48
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,075
Where did you get that old clunker?

49
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,909
It's no clunker,
it's brand new, it's mine.

50
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,395
Lemme try it, I'll give it a go.

51
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,235
That's enough, give the scooter back.

52
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,077
What are you doin'?

53
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,390
You're dead! I'll kill you!

54
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,239
You're dead!

55
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,032
Get lost, don't touch the car.

56
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,558
Don't worry, it can all be fixed.

57
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,232
Ma?

58
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,472
Where is she?

59
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,751
Sit down I have to talk to you.

60
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,750
I want to paint the walls

61
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,440
and rent the house
to tourists this summer.

62
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,515
Fishing's no kind of living anymore.

63
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,274
The boat's become
an old hunk of wood.

64
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,552
It's worth more
demolished than afloat.

65
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,958
Meantime...

66
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,433
we can take tourists
around the island.

67
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,352
Then, when summer's over,

68
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,071
we'll demolish it.

69
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,669
With the money we get,
we'll start a new life.

70
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,677
We were taught to fish.

71
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,354
Filippo has to learn
other things now.

72
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,558
Ma, what's with you?

73
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,309
We have to leave this island.

74
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,835
I want you to see other things,
different, new things,

75
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,837
talk to different people.

76
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,159
- Wouldn't you like that?
- I dunno.

77
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,479
I dunno.

78
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,158
What? You're smokin', Ma?

79
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,429
Ma!

80
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,150
All these cigarette butts,

81
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,396
this wall all ripped off...

82
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,273
I don't know you anymore,
you're actin' like a lil' kid.

83
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,074
You don't even talk correctly.

84
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,117
That's it, I'm leaving,

85
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,078
I'm out of here!

86
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,952
Lil' kid!

87
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,317
What happened?

88
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,595
What did you get in to?
You broke it already?

89
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,189
- It wasn't me.
- Who, then?

90
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,829
Franco and his friends.

91
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,793
- And what did you do?
- I threw stones at them.

92
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,993
- Can the scooter be fixed?
- You gotta learn to fight back!

93
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,792
You've got to hit hard!!

94
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,031
Come along with me.

95
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,431
- Get movin'!
- My scooter?

96
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,278
Leave it there, get moving!

97
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,469
What are you doing?

98
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,388
The guy who starts it, wins.

99
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,799
Let's go.

100
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,835
Let's go!

101
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,312
Give it here.

102
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,318
Gramps!

103
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,278
What's wrong?

104
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,716
I'm not going on land.

105
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,278
You're not going on land,
but to the hospital.

106
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,914
What can be that serious?

107
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,559
Serious...

108
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,436
There's something for sure.

109
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,559
Ernesto,

110
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,913
if you feel sick again on the island,

111
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,111
I won't be able to help you.

112
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,193
You could write a prescription,
I'll go to the pharmacy,

113
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,789
get the medicine and I'll be okay.

114
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,798
Will you stop acting like a kid?
You need a hospital.

115
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,353
Turn that friggin' phone off!

116
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,279
Ernesto, listen to the doctor!

117
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,319
We go to the hospital,
do this check-up

118
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,590
and we'll stop worrying.

119
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,797
What are you scared of?

120
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,116
Scared? I'm not scared of anything,

121
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,751
I'm relaxed and calm
and I'm not budgin'.

122
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,598
Knowwhat, Dad?
I can't deal with you!

123
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,914
Good... get some fresh air!

124
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,318
Anyway, the visit's over, right doc?

125
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,117
I'll see you out.

126
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,832
See what I found,
from when you were little, remember?

127
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,439
Knock it off!

128
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,517
Up there, Filippo!

129
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,232
Come on, guys!

130
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,640
Hello, welcome to the island.

131
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,957
Interested in an apartment in town?
25 euros per person.

132
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,077
Go get the Texan girl!

133
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,957
Lentils, calamari,

134
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,152
lasagna, baked pasta,
it's all delicious.

135
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,272
Ask Marco for anything you need,
he's in a yellow T-shirt.

136
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,112
Would you like an apartment in town?

137
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,629
It's all remodeled, new.

138
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,037
There are boat rides,
my son does them.

139
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,674
- Boat rides!
- You'll see the grottoes.

140
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,632
Let me through.

141
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,149
Marco, get into position there.

142
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,438
Thank you, Captain.

143
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,279
- No one's stopping.
- Go away.

144
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,753
I'll go make sandwiches.

145
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,748
- Baked pasta, lasagna...
- How much?

146
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,349
Twenty-five euros per person,
it's cheap.

147
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,394
You'll be losing
a lovely two-bedroom apartment.

148
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,432
Hello.

149
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,318
Welcome.

150
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,313
Come in.

151
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,911
Leave your backpacks there.

152
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,550
Are these porcelain?

153
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,116
It's the family's collection.

154
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,710
There are wedding pictures too.

155
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,951
- This is you?
- Yes.

156
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,191
This is the courtyard.

157
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,034
- Nice garden!
- Thank you.

158
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,559
They like it!

159
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,228
Guys, they haven't got a sea view.

160
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,715
They haven't got air conditioning.

161
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,792
Do you have a boat?

162
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,036
We got a boat, we got fresh fish,

163
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,390
we got my mom's cooking,
we got everything.

164
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,512
My name's Giulietta.

165
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,069
Maura.

166
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,034
- Stefano.
- Marco.

167
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,350
- Where are you from?
- Padua.

168
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,199
- I'm from Arezzo.
- Milan.

169
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,636
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

170
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,512
- Twenty.
- Me too.

171
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,995
- You're the same age.
- Cut it out!

172
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,311
I say it's fine,

173
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,033
we'll take it.

174
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,472
It's a deal.

175
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,675
I forgot, if you need anything,

176
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,677
we're right here.

177
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,189
- In the garage?
- Yes.

178
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,075
Okay, thank you.

179
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,395
- Did you tell them the price?
- Yes.

180
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,310
- What did I tell you?
- What?

181
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,911
Don't touch me in front of people.

182
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,877
Get me, Ma?

183
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,193
We're alone now, can I get my fill?

184
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,152
Knock it off!

185
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,079
Go away!

186
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,475
Stop doin' that.

187
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,353
Cut it out.

188
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,793
- Let's have a toast.
- Okay, a toast.

189
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,036
We'll toast to my son Filippo,

190
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,193
who fished three nice tourists today.

191
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,593
Three!

192
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,434
None at all, if it weren't for me.

193
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,519
Great, Filippo!

194
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,311
The little blonde?

195
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,992
Pretty, isn't she?

196
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,679
Yeah, she's pretty.

197
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,518
- The blond is pretty.
- What's her name?

198
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,428
Maura.

199
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,114
To Maura!

200
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,593
To Maura.

201
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,273
- Such elegance!
- Thanks, you too.

202
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,040
Thanks! Where are you going?

203
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,631
Just around.

204
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,313
- Ice cream?
- No, we're getting drunk tonight.

205
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,273
Fine!

206
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,517
We're here, sit with us?

207
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,396
Look who I found.

208
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,231
Can we go out in your boat tomorrow?

209
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,749
I'm going fishing
with my grandpa tomorrow,

210
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,032
the day after's okay,
but we leave at 9 a.m.

211
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,592
Will it offend your grandpa
if I go topless?

212
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,359
Top... what?

213
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,158
Topless.

214
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,551
Wear what you like.

215
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,993
She means without the top part.

216
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,756
Maura's asking if she can go

217
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,758
bare-tits
on the boat with your grandpa.

218
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,880
Last night I spoke
to Teresa on the phone.

219
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,715
Remember my cousin?

220
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,110
The one in Trapani.

221
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,554
No.

222
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,593
She said we could
stay with her for a while.

223
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,996
There's no lack of work there.

224
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,034
I don't want to destroy Dad's boat.

225
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,199
Sweetheart, we have no choice.

226
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,838
I have to work.

227
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,156
Here, on the island,
I can work only two months a year,

228
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,430
cleaning houses for tourists.

229
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,993
And you too,
what's your future here?

230
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,760
I'll take tourists out on the boat.

231
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,518
In summer.

232
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,356
We both have to work, winter too.

233
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,271
And what do I do?

234
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,957
Be alone my whole life?

235
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,953
Stay here with me,
wouldn't you like that?

236
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,398
Yes, I would.

237
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,031
And when you get married?

238
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,668
Marry! I'll never marry anyone!

239
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,871
Who'd marry me?

240
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,189
Gramps, come see!

241
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,279
Look!

242
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,916
Coast Guard, can you hear me?
Over.

243
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,157
<i>Go ahead.</i>
<i>Who's calling the Coast Guard?</i>

244
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,916
Motor fishing vessel, Santuzza here,

245
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,714
we're twenty-five miles south-east,

246
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,708
we spotted a boat
with illegals, what do we do?

247
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,275
<i>Remain in the area.</i>

248
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,438
<i>Keep the boat in sight.</i>

249
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,108
<i>Do not approach them.</i>

250
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,072
They're jumpin' in the sea!

251
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,113
<i>A patrol boat's in the area.</i>

252
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,996
Get the life vests ready.

253
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,396
If we take them aboard,
we'll get in trouble.

254
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,353
I've never left people
in the sea, come on!

255
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,352
Get closer.

256
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,639
Careful.

257
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,191
Take my hand.

258
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,988
Pull!

259
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,997
Pull the line.

260
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,638
Pull the kid up.

261
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,079
Grab him.

262
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,518
The woman.

263
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,117
Grab the woman.

264
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,198
Gramps!

265
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,591
What's wrong with my grandpa?

266
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,350
Hurry, take the helm,
get back to land fast.

267
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,556
Good, breathe!

268
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,197
Push!

269
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,959
Go!

270
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,874
Hi, we're ready.

271
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,277
For what?

272
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,074
The boat ride, with your grandpa...

273
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,078
- At nine.
- You forgot?

274
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,754
Yeah!

275
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,592
Wait here.

276
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,434
So?

277
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,308
I told them
we'd go out in the boat today.

278
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,358
Nowwhat?

279
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,632
Let's take them,
so they stay away from the house.

280
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,951
You're leaving me here alone?

281
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,351
Lock the door, don't open to anyone,

282
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,551
we'll be back in a few hours.

283
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,114
Hurry back, please!

284
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,516
Don't worry.

285
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,872
Thank you.

286
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,794
No... no thank you.

287
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,872
Understand what I say?

288
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,632
Little.

289
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,637
Now you rest,

290
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,479
eat and then go.

291
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,033
Okay?

292
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,118
Eat.

293
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,355
Yes, eat and then go.

294
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,239
Good morning!

295
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,913
- Good morning.
- Watch your head.

296
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,194
- We sit where we want?
- Where you want.

297
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,791
What's this guy want?

298
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,475
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

299
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,470
The registration
for this vessel, please.

300
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,238
- Pucillo Pietro?
- Pucillo Ernesto.

301
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,432
- Where's Pucillo Pietro?
- That was my son, he died.

302
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,875
No title transfer papers.

303
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,313
You spotted the illegal aliens
on the south coast?

304
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,839
Yessir.

305
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,112
Why didn't you say
you'd taken four onboard?

306
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,629
- Didn't they come to the police?
- Yes.

307
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,070
But you're obliged to report them,
didn't you know?

308
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,193
- I got no practice with laws.
- No practice!

309
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,550
Then you'll have to practice up.

310
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,592
Could I see your license
to carry tourists?

311
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,393
I don't have one.

312
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,556
I'll have to seize the boat.

313
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,512
You can't be serious!

314
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,994
I'm more than serious.

315
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,430
This boat gives us our only income.

316
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,554
No permission to carry tourists

317
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,876
and, an even greater
breach of the law:

318
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,548
Aiding and abetting
illegal immigration.

319
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,073
Do you know the Law of the Sea?

320
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,475
Should I have let
those people drown?

321
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,357
Things have changed,
tell your colleagues too.

322
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,714
The craft will be sealed,
turn over the keys.

323
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,396
So, you want to ruin us!

324
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,392
The keys.

325
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,555
What's this? Get this off!
Have it out with me.

326
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,513
- Who's this?
- No, who are you?

327
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,632
Calm down, kid.

328
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,876
Calm down,
looks like a stuffed squid!

329
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,275
- Don't ruin your life.
- Get lost!

330
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,595
Move it!

331
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,472
Calm down, if you don't want trouble.

332
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,636
Good, keep him inside.

333
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,114
Come to the office
to read and sign the report.

334
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,312
Please get off, thank you.

335
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,396
Let's go, come on!

336
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,117
I'll smash everything!

337
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,830
They seized the fishing boat,
fuckin' cops!

338
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,031
Calm down and tell me!

339
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,314
Is it true that saving people at sea
is forbidden?

340
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,514
I knew it!

341
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,713
- Take them away.
- I don't knowwhat to do.

342
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,036
Keep them far from the house.

343
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,073
- What happened?
- Nothing, forget it.

344
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,430
What's this about illegal aliens?

345
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,710
Come on, let's take a ride.

346
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,078
There we go, good girl!

347
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,474
She smells your hands.

348
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,869
She was born with your hands.

349
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,228
What happened to Ernesto
could happen to any of us.

350
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,512
So we have to protest,

351
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,469
make them hear us.

352
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,637
All of us together...

353
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,832
have to pay a visit
to that stuffed squid they sent us.

354
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,237
We have to quit taking them aboard,

355
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,271
that's the point, pure and simple.

356
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,877
My father taught me
to save lives at sea.

357
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,515
But I have to teach my kids

358
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,598
they gotta change course
when black skin's in the water.

359
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,156
Why do you say that?
Have you ever changed course?

360
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,797
No, but if they seize my boat,
what do I do?

361
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,991
Come eat at your house?

362
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,834
Why, have you ever gone hungry?

363
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,632
I say... how's it possible

364
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,037
for a fisherman to starve,
when he's got his sea?

365
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,838
There used to be sixty of us,
the sea was busting with fish.

366
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,834
Each of us
had at least seven, eight kids.

367
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:45,351
We all went barefoot, full of lice,

368
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,349
but the important decisions

369
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,596
were made all together.

370
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,515
With due respect to you elders,

371
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,950
there aren't many
of us fishermen left.

372
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,233
In your day there were
lots of fish in the sea,

373
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,672
but nowwhen we go out,
instead of fish,

374
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,038
we fish live bodies
and lots of dead ones.

375
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,110
Excuse me, men,

376
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,312
I'd like to know
why you have to take them aboard.

377
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,756
The law says we mustn't do anything.

378
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,953
A patrol boat gets them,
pulls them aboard

379
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,720
and takes them back
where they came from, that's it.

380
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:28,596
But it's us who's here and these
new rules go against our own.

381
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,194
We live on a reef
in the middle of the sea

382
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,595
and we have to respect
the laws of the sea.

383
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,916
It's always been so
and has to stay so.

384
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,158
Sorry, men,

385
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,590
but we also live on tourism here

386
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,997
and tourists don't like
seeing these half-dead illegals

387
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,236
as they enjoy their vacations.

388
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,829
These people pay
and want peace and quiet.

389
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,238
Let's talk straight, all these
illegals and these landings

390
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,556
are bad publicity for us.

391
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,071
Mr. Publicity is here!

392
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,276
They're bad publicity for us!

393
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,789
Do you think we should let them drown

394
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,479
for publicity?

395
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,838
Isn't there a chairlift, Filippo?

396
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,513
We're here.

397
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,600
What did we come here for?

398
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,390
To see my animals,
I haven't seen them in so long.

399
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,631
This is Rosina.

400
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,871
This is Glorina.

401
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,877
Her horns are broken, happens.

402
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,834
Come on, it's damned hot
and stinks of shit!

403
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,557
- Maura, do something.
- Fili, let's go to the sea!

404
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,392
Yeah, but to the sea!

405
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,518
To the sea, to the sea!

406
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,711
- Sure?
- Yeah, we'll go to the sea.

407
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,072
C'mon, let's swim!

408
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,712
So...

409
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,995
We, from here...

410
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,357
to here...

411
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,195
two years of journey.

412
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,997
Then sea.

413
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,355
Nowwhere are we?

414
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,678
We're not on the globe,
this island is too small.

415
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,469
Done.

416
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,671
- How much?
- Twenty euros.

417
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,151
Have a good day.

418
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,877
- You're a lifeguard now?
- No, just helping my uncle.

419
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,357
What do we do?

420
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,994
How about two cots and an umbrella?

421
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,633
Sure.

422
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,590
Will we go back to the boat?

423
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,509
Yes, with my uncle,
we'll take a nice boat ride.

424
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,271
Everything okay on the beach?

425
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,711
- How's it going, gents?
- Fine.

426
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,237
Is it true some illegals
landed here?

427
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,317
Who says that?

428
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,159
They seized a boat
right in front of us!

429
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,191
Yeah, I heard that.

430
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,391
But the boat was seized

431
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,512
because he had
no license to carry tourists.

432
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,913
Illegals don't land here anymore.

433
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,396
Here there's just fish
and fabulous sea beds.

434
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,990
Enjoy your vacation,
no illegals here!

435
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,079
There aren't any.

436
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,750
They say lots of things
here on the island.

437
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,832
Where's the mike?

438
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,359
So!

439
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,118
Testing...

440
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,398
An announcement for all vacationers.

441
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,831
In half an hour,
we'll all meet here at the kiosk:

442
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,429
Sail the island,
swim with shearwaters

443
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,598
and diving competition, okay?

444
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,271
Maria, give us some music,
what's this morgue?

445
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,829
We're not doing the right thing.

446
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,877
What's the right thing?

447
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,990
We have to go to the Carabinieri!

448
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,191
Carabinieri? Great idea!

449
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,278
So they'll seize the house too.

450
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,914
If we report them now,
they can't do anything to us

451
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,712
and we come out clean.

452
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,999
Clean?

453
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,158
Clean!

454
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,871
Don't make me do things
I don't want to.

455
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,150
Then I'll go.

456
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,795
Whatever you decide,
wait at least one more day.

457
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,430
Wait for what?

458
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:11,070
We're wasting too much time,
we have to act fast.

459
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,551
Hello, come along!

460
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,232
Come here.

461
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,192
What's this, a protest?

462
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,118
Even if I'd wanted to help you,
after this mess

463
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,311
there's nothing I can do.

464
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,951
Come back tomorrow for the report.

465
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,714
Goodbye.

466
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,154
Goodbye!

467
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,551
You are blessed.

468
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,552
You saved me,

469
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,154
now you are my sister.

470
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,309
Sister? Blessed?

471
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,152
Hon, you have to go.

472
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,872
Go...

473
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,318
Exactly, you got to go.

474
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,556
Go to Turin.

475
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,159
Turin?

476
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,156
My husband work.

477
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,753
- Your husband works in Turin?
- Yes.

478
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,431
How I go to Turin?

479
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,913
Easy to say!

480
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,070
Maybe you don't get it,
you've got to cross the water.

481
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:51,269
You take the boat,
then a train, then a bus.

482
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,793
Sounds easy?
How can you ever make it to Turin?

483
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,631
Anyway I don't care,
just so you leave here.

484
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,353
The law says I can't help you.

485
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,551
If I do, the police will jail me.

486
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,988
No, police no!

487
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,075
Please!

488
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,918
What are you doing?

489
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,432
She's your sister,
why did you do that?

490
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,111
She's not my sister.

491
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,150
He not want the baby.

492
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,395
We long time in jail in Libya.

493
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,433
All women and children together.

494
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,390
At night, police would come.

495
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,190
Children see.

496
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,510
My husband sent money

497
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,509
for the police of the jail
and for the boat.

498
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,231
Many days at sea, no food.

499
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:42,591
The boats see us and not stop.

500
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,870
The boats see us...

501
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,830
they always go away.

502
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,271
I not tell my husband
about the baby.

503
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,076
What name did you give her?

504
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,551
She has your name.

505
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,391
What is your name?

506
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,157
Which one's yours?

507
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,755
Why are you being sneaky?

508
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,912
Get in, hurry.

509
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,270
Why should I hurry?

510
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,229
- Is it yours?
- Yeah, sit down.

511
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:05,150
No, it's not yours! Whose is it?

512
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,791
Are we stealing it?

513
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,758
- It's yours? No.
- You gotta be quiet.

514
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,390
- Quiet?
- It's not mine.

515
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,635
We're not stealing it!

516
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,757
Sure, we're stealing it.

517
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,829
The owner won't get pissed?

518
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,157
No, he won't.

519
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,118
How do you know?

520
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,516
- I know everything.
- You do?

521
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,869
Yeah.

522
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,953
- What's this thing?
- It's a fishing light.

523
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:54,309
A fishing light, you can see the sea,
the reefs, the dolphins.

524
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,432
- Let's turn it on.
- Later.

525
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,155
We can't see a thing.
Isn't it dangerous?

526
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,079
No! You talk too much.

527
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,829
- If there's a sandbar?
- Cut your yakkin', enough!

528
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:09,350
- My head hurts, you talk too much!
- Can't I ask anything?

529
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,958
Good grief, holy Lord Jesus!

530
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,079
Look.

531
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,793
Beautiful!

532
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,833
Do you smoke?

533
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,878
What is it, drugs?

534
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,432
Yeah, drugs.

535
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,231
Have you got a girlfriend?

536
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,914
No, I want to stay free for now.

537
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,072
Free from what?

538
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,793
Free.

539
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,919
What is it?

540
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,756
Why did you leave me in the dark?

541
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,799
What's going on?

542
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,638
Get in, hurry!

543
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:47,989
Get in.

544
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,150
- What's going on?
- Hurry!

545
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,632
Sit down tight.

546
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,279
C'mon, start up!

547
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,038
Let go!

548
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,357
Let's get out of here!

549
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,951
We'll capsize.

550
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,911
Let's go.

551
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,793
Stop it, Filippo!

552
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,955
Stop it!

553
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,073
Get out.

554
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:52,790
What do we do?
We have to go to the Carabinieri.

555
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,398
Let's go straight to the Carabinieri.

556
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:00,237
Let's go, we have to do something!

557
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,351
We have to do something!

558
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,551
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Shut up!

559
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,557
- Shut up?
- Shut up!

560
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,911
- We have to do something!
- Go home.

561
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:13,430
Home? Someone probably drowned,
let's call the police.

562
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,638
Get home! Let go of me!

563
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,158
Where are you going?

564
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,437
You fell asleep on the beach?

565
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,119
Wake up.

566
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,070
Come on, we have lots to do.

567
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:13,679
Let's go.

568
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,270
Filippo, we have to comb the beach.

569
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:44,993
I'm talking to you!

570
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:48,034
Just sit in the sun
and relax, everybody.

571
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,948
Nothing's happened,
stay where you are.

572
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,796
I'm talking to you, Filippo.

573
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,396
Filippo, come here!

574
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,469
I'll never share my food with her.

575
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,878
I don't even want to touch her.

576
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,715
Promise you won't try
to hurt her again.

577
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,273
When Dad sees us coming with her,

578
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,954
he'll send us both away.

579
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,791
If Dad's the man we saw leave
five years ago,

580
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,509
he'll understand.

581
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,272
What's going on?

582
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:05,954
Open up.

583
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,511
I wanna stay here, alone.

584
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,639
You locked it? I haven't seen you
for two days, open up!

585
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,399
Open up!

586
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,154
Open up.

587
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,753
No, Ma!

588
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,717
Let me come in.

589
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,791
Ma, go away!

590
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,277
Go away, Ma.

591
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,477
Rhythm, guys!

592
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,628
A sail around the island,
aperitif at sunset!

593
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,273
Rhythm!

594
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,311
Dad! How are you?

595
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:07,714
Fine.

596
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,310
I'd like to borrow
your van for two days,

597
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,112
I'm going to the hospital.

598
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:15,914
Finally! I'll take you, wait for me.

599
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:18,588
- I'll go with Giulietta and Filippo.
- When?

600
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:19,994
This evening.

601
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,794
Get the keys from Maria,
I'll come say goodbye later.

602
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,592
Let's say goodbye now.

603
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,276
See you in two days.

604
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,431
Guys, are you ready?

605
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,879
Let's go.

606
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,274
The terra firma is waiting for us.

607
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:04,518
We're ready. Go.

608
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,398
Now.

609
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,030
Sorry, Giulietta.

610
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,599
Lie down.

611
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,072
Head down.

612
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,436
Faster, Ma!

613
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,110
What do we do?

614
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,835
What happened?

615
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:53,237
It's mayhem, some illegals
landed to the west.

616
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,276
They found two hidden under a truck.

617
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,070
It can't be done tonight.

618
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,792
Let's go home,
it's not the right night.

619
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,675
Come on, get it started.

620
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,952
Stop!

621
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,192
Get out.

622
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,799
Get aboard, hurry.

623
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,195
Hide!
