1
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:23,345
Along the Ridge

2
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,224
Wake up call!

3
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,632
You kook!

4
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:08,094
- Stupid cow!
- It's for your own good!

5
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,665
Tommaso?

6
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:20,311
He can't still be in bed...

7
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,579
What are you still doing in bed?

8
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,446
I'm ready, Dad...

9
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,712
Ready my arse!

10
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:31,516
I just don't know, I'm fed up!

11
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:32,691
Viola left 30 minutes ago!

12
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,054
Same story every morning!

13
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,321
Put on your shoe!

14
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,624
One, two...

15
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,892
Send you to military school, I will!

16
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,865
Pack your bag and get going.

17
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,868
Dad, did you think it over?

18
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,308
What?

19
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,744
Football school.

20
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,315
You serious?

21
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,581
You wanna quit swimming
to play football?

22
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:07,225
Football's for dickheads!

23
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,953
They all play football, now you too?

24
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,189
Swimming's a noble sport,

25
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,856
it's a different story altogether.

26
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:20,472
You could become the Italian
100m freestyle champion.

27
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,438
I'm good at football too,

28
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,478
plus the pool is miles away.

29
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:31,014
Don't be a dope, go to school!

30
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:43,492
Everybody's complaining about you
and your darn soccer ball!

31
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,176
- Where's our teacher?
- In the headmaster's office.

32
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,942
They put a mute in class with us,

33
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,781
he's out there.

34
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,823
Did you see how tall he is?

35
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:20,397
He's massive.

36
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,228
Is he mute, like mute?

37
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,532
What's all this racket?

38
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,698
Have you all suspended, I will!

39
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:36,111
I don't want to hear anyone
so much as breathe.

40
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,282
He's big, but he's our age.

41
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,512
Says who?

42
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:43,713
He lives near me, he saw his dad die

43
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,450
and hasn't said a word since.

44
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,457
He was eating his soup and fell

45
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,461
face-first into the bowl.

46
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,826
Maybe the soup was foul.

47
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,357
Here she comes!

48
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,465
Good morning, kids.

49
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,702
We have a new classmate,

50
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,937
his name is Claudio.

51
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:12,448
Claudio, go sit near Carolina.

52
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,322
Time for roll call.

53
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:03,697
Come on Tommi, move it!

54
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,397
Goggles on and go!

55
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,483
Tommi

56
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,142
I'm fine thanks, and you?

57
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,878
What was your 25m time?

58
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,784
16 seconds.

59
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,049
Hi

60
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,693
Hi

61
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:15,833
What's so funny?

62
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,805
I'm chatting with this guy,

63
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,741
you can't believe what he's saying!

64
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,749
I want your room tidied
before dinner.

65
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,820
No, tomorrow, there's no school.

66
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,650
What d'you mean, tomorrow!

67
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,451
Tomorrow we're going
to Vincenzo and Marina's.

68
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,423
Cut it short Viola,

69
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,587
you can't spend two hours online.

70
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,359
What a bloody mess!

71
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,126
What's that?

72
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,627
What is that?

73
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:50,071
No, like hell, this is too much!

74
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,471
Whose is this?

75
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,941
Not mine.

76
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,205
Mine, I was going to pick it up.

77
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:56,905
You were going to...

78
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,177
Anyway, it's biodegradable!

79
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,890
Dad,
I'm sleeping in your bed tonight.

80
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:13,759
You slept here two Fridays in a row.

81
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,668
Am I made of honey or something?

82
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,438
Aren't you too big
to be sleeping with daddy?

83
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,743
Pia, someone's looking for you.

84
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,677
- Who is it?
- Dunno.

85
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:30,062
Off to the countryside!

86
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,399
Where'd you go to buy the sausage,
you took forever.

87
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,407
The butcher was closed
so I went to the market.

88
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,238
Sing us one of your made-up songs.

89
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:43,849
Go on, please!

90
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:09,236
Lady, outta the way
or I'll run you down!

91
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,035
Hold on...

92
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:16,008
- It's open.
- What's going on, Dad?

93
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,740
I gotta do something.

94
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,386
Tommi, come with me.

95
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,400
Good morning.

96
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,736
Is Barzelli in?

97
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,006
Let me check if he's in a meeting.

98
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,181
Do you have an appointment?

99
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:55,484
No, tell him I'm gonna wait
one minute this time.

100
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,680
I'll go check.

101
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,918
Sit down.

102
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,189
They'd better not piss me off.

103
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,594
Why?

104
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,635
They're trying to rip me off.

105
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:20,476
I'm sorry,
he won't be free for another hour.

106
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,448
Wanna see me pissed off?

107
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,644
- Sir...
- Wanna see me get pissed off?

108
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,415
Barzelli, get out here,

109
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,023
I'm getting really pissed off now!

110
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,454
No need to shout.

111
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,720
Shut up, I've been here 3 times!

112
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:40,832
Last time I waited an hour and a half.

113
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Let's see today.

114
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,366
Come on Barzelli,

115
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,835
I swear I'll come and get you!

116
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:50,840
I'm gonna count to five. One...

117
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,808
How dare you?

118
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:57,278
We have a secretary,
call her and make an appointment.

119
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,543
I've been here three times,
you've fucked me around enough!

120
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,913
Dad

121
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,317
Want me to smash your face in?

122
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:07,357
- Dad, let's go.
- Stop whinging.

123
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:10,324
What are we gonna do, huh?

124
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:14,796
Gonna give me this fucking money?

125
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:18,130
I'll write you a cheque.

126
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,475
Then write me a fucking cheque.

127
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,337
How much do we owe him?

128
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,708
Let me check.

129
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,850
780 Euro.

130
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,423
We're through.

131
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:51,127
I decide when we're through, prick.

132
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,201
Let's go.

133
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,411
Tasty sausage.

134
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,517
A bit of jogging...

135
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:11,181
You look good.

136
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,520
I'm fine, we're doing all right.

137
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:18,185
The kids look great!

138
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,265
We're doing all right.

139
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,061
And the missus?

140
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,330
She hasn't shown up?

141
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,667
I'm going to the disco.

142
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,938
You're so rude!

143
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,411
Why?

144
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,482
You finally came to visit

145
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,314
and he runs off to the disco.

146
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,457
Does your girlfriend yell at you
if you don't go?

147
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,650
I got people waiting for me.

148
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,820
You're afraid!

149
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,593
- What do I do?
- Get naked.

150
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,259
- Totally naked?
- Yes.

151
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:02,430
Even my singlet?
How embarrassing!

152
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,700
I'm going.

153
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:07,607
No, you lost the bet,
now you have to pay up.

154
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,682
Ready?

155
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,080
Tommi, come on then.

156
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,929
Not like that,
like you're washing a car!

157
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,565
You have to caress us.

158
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,864
Enough!

159
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,028
I'm sick of these dumb games.

160
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,403
Dad's right, you're a wuss.

161
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,373
I'll tell him.

162
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,545
Is he serious?

163
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,476
No way!

164
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:50,987
My big baby!

165
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:56,184
What have you done,
you're so serious?

166
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,936
- Stop it!
- No fighting.

167
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,444
Tell dad what you've done.

168
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,815
Stop it, you slut!

169
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,822
Hey!

170
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:32,421
Don't you ever say that again!

171
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,034
Don't cry!

172
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,688
Six to four!

173
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:10,665
You're a pain in the arse Tommi,
get lost!

174
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,463
You be the goalie, asshole.

175
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,638
What'd you say?

176
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:14,772
Asshole.

177
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,635
You wanna smack in the face?

178
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,809
Try it.

179
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:21,404
Moron, you're a pain in the arse!

180
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,111
Recess is almost over,

181
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,685
if you don't wanna play
at least let us play.

182
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,991
You're all assholes, fuck off.

183
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,254
Hi

184
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,788
I just moved to the third floor,
near those air conditioners.

185
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,398
- Where do you live?
- Top floor.

186
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,660
Cool, we live on the same stairs.

187
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,770
- Hi!
- Good day!

188
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:56,135
See, there are kids your age here.

189
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,175
Can I play with you?

190
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,012
Here.

191
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,947
Careful, you sweated a lot already.

192
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,115
Letizia, leave him be.

193
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,480
Come in when you want a snack.

194
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:09,052
What'll we play?

195
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:12,884
Let's practice our passes.

196
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,473
What a scare!

197
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:32,542
Poor baby!
You got slapped yesterday...

198
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,508
Poor baby!

199
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:37,873
You went to their house?

200
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,211
Yeah, to have a snack.

201
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:41,385
What's the house like?

202
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,888
Huge. They got plants like trees and

203
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,685
a painting that covers a whole wall.

204
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,556
His room is full of toys.

205
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:51,729
What kind?

206
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,388
All kinds.

207
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:59,435
I've run into them on the stairs,
they're rich.

208
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:03,439
They put grates on their windows
that face the courtyard.

209
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,002
Ready!

210
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,279
The plateau...

211
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:20,715
The plateau for the tongeau.
Don't make that face.

212
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,459
Tommi

213
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,268
Too much!

214
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,530
Don't start, you'd better lick
that plate clean.

215
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:35,229
This is no time for sophisms.

216
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:38,069
What the heck are sophisms?

217
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,608
Lots for me.

218
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:43,270
Good girl, see she makes me happy!

219
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,451
Eat up.

220
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,089
Dad's going away for two days.

221
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,191
Where to?

222
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,218
To Bolzano to get new equipment.

223
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,887
As of today, daddy's his own boss.

224
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,657
You got a second mortgage?

225
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,166
Yep, I'll have it paid off soon.

226
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,337
Hope so.

227
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,530
Aren't you the optimist!

228
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,698
We just have to save up a bit,

229
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:16,781
avoid eating out.

230
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:21,181
We can take a cut in our allowance,
from 7 to 5 Euro.

231
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,378
Right, little brother?

232
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,614
You've already paid for swimming?

233
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,418
Yeah.

234
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:31,359
Don't worry, no penny pinching
to be done there.

235
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:36,297
For now,
your allowance stays at 7 Euros.

236
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,072
Who the hell is that at this hour?

237
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,338
- Shut up!
- Don't you dare.

238
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,606
If you tell him, I'll clobber you.

239
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,454
This is my seat.

240
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:10,591
Go sit near Claudio.

241
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:13,804
Get up.

242
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:18,068
He's here now, go sit near the mute.

243
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:22,577
Tommaso,
go sit back there near Claudio.

244
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,874
Tomorrow, dinner at the porter's.

245
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,069
Tonight, do what you can.

246
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:57,448
No mucking around. Your backpack!

247
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:58,449
Bye, Giuseppe.

248
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,940
Bye

249
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,293
Tell your daddy that I gave you

250
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,902
sausage and broccoli too.

251
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:52,903
Ok.

252
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,064
When does he get back?

253
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,104
Around 10:30.

254
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,299
Set your alarm.

255
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,775
No probs!

256
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:14,983
I wanna watch the Pele video.

257
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,185
Who says you get to choose?

258
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:20,195
Don't be a pain, I said it first.

259
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:24,699
Gimme a kiss, hold me, sugar pie!

260
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,498
I love you, hold me!

261
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:30,698
Gimme kiss.

262
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,174
Get off me!

263
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,957
Gimme a kiss!

264
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:51,195
Get the key, slave!

265
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,727
My babies!

266
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:14,378
Aren't you going to
give your mum a kiss?

267
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,680
Viola

268
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,346
Please, my love...

269
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,812
My darlings!

270
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:48,783
My heart was breaking without you.

271
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:07,205
Don't you want to go to bed?

272
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:09,863
We'll wait for dad.

273
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:13,101
Aren't you tired?

274
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:26,450
Look how your hair's grown.

275
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,625
This fringe?

276
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:32,186
Me and Brunella
cut each other's hair.

277
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,364
Who's Brunella?

278
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,696
A friend from dance class.

279
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:40,361
You're still doing dance? Good girl.

280
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:07,398
Don't worry, I'll talk to dad.

281
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,534
Yes, darling...

282
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,972
Here's my pride and joy!

283
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,111
How'd it go?

284
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,240
Mission accomplished.

285
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:58,905
What have you been up to?

286
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,211
Come in, there's a surprise.

287
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:06,050
A surprise?
You tidied up your room?

288
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,055
No!

289
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,928
Dad

290
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,396
Hi

291
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:28,143
Can I talk to you?

292
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:51,961
Out.

293
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,371
Get out!

294
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,170
Please Renato, let me talk.

295
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,173
Get out!

296
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,279
Please, don't throw me out.

297
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:06,884
Don't throw me out.

298
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,053
Please, let me stay.

299
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:12,689
Don't cry.

300
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,518
Viola, go to your room
with your brother.

301
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,921
Mum came back.

302
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,528
Go to your room!

303
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,860
Don't be mean.

304
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:28,197
Stefania, I'll give you
three seconds to leave...

305
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,069
Out.

306
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,849
Please, I want to stay with you.

307
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:46,923
Don't touch me!

308
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,151
Get out!

309
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:50,988
Damned slut!

310
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:54,893
Goddamned slut!

311
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,899
I want to stay with you all.

312
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,832
I want to be with my babies!

313
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,995
You're ruining my life.

314
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:06,234
You are ruining our lives!

315
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,641
I've changed, I swear.

316
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:12,271
Oh, cut the crap!
Get out!

317
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,813
Kids, go to your room.

318
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:16,851
I can't live without you.

319
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:19,285
You can't live without us?

320
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,925
Say it to their faces.

321
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,583
Tell them where you went,

322
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,390
look at them,
tell them where you go to get fucked

323
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:29,931
every time you disappear
like a crook.

324
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,001
Tell them you'd rather be

325
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,833
with a wealthy piece of shit

326
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:41,468
than with that pauper, your husband.

327
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:42,977
Stop it!

328
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:46,549
You've ruined my life,
you fucking slag!

329
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:49,915
Kids, to your room, I said.

330
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,885
I said go!

331
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,786
A goddamned bitch in heat.

332
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:05,028
Put on your pyjamas and go to bed.

333
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,703
Viola

334
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:48,242
Kids?

335
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,347
Tommi

336
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,173
Tommi

337
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,714
Put some clothes on
and come into the kitchen,

338
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:00,653
we have a decision to make.

339
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:16,095
Darling!

340
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:27,314
Sit down.

341
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:47,394
Last night I decided to talk
to your mother a bit,

342
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:54,478
to give her another chance
to explain herself,

343
00:31:54,646 --> 00:32:00,050
even if it's happened

344
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,917
one too many times before.

345
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,022
I don't even know why,
all I know is...

346
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:11,492
Maybe I just wanted to know
what goes on in her rotten head.

347
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:15,394
I understood

348
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:21,436
that there's so much confusion
in her mixed up mind,

349
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:25,269
that she's probably
the one who needs help,

350
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,537
not us.

351
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:33,650
Right? You agree?

352
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:36,987
Say something! You agree?

353
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:37,988
Agree!

354
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:41,015
Stefania,

355
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:48,030
now I want you to say this,
in front of them,

356
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:51,100
if you are sure...

357
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:56,206
Sure you want
to be a mother again

358
00:32:56,374 --> 00:33:01,778
instead of screwing around all over
town as you've always done?

359
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:08,051
I'm sure.

360
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,881
Forgive me, I'm sure.

361
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:14,183
I was wrong, I know,

362
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:18,386
forgive me for making you suffer.

363
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:22,522
Forgive me, forgive me, Renato.

364
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,724
Forgive me.

365
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:26,699
I've had enough of this shit!

366
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:31,103
Got it? It's on their heads!

367
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,678
Okay, kids...

368
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:43,785
I think she's being honest.

369
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:46,856
You're big enough to be

370
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,984
a part of this decision.

371
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:54,256
Do you want your mother
to come back,

372
00:33:54,432 --> 00:34:00,837
or do we leave her
to take care of herself?

373
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:05,772
Dad, let her come back home, please.

374
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:12,314
Thank you, darling.

375
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,917
Tommi

376
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:24,294
Want mummy to take care of you,
wake you up in the morning,

377
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:28,159
make you breakfast,
and take you to school?

378
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,460
Honey?

379
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,639
Yeah.

380
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:39,074
Yes? Come here!

381
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,971
Thank you.

382
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,583
Give me your hand, thank you.

383
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,981
Thank you, Renato.

384
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:52,020
God help us!

385
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:57,358
I'm going to clean myself up
then make you some breakfast.

386
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:58,528
I'll come with you.

387
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,494
ok

388
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:07,462
No school today, though.

389
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:09,629
Figures...

390
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:14,702
No swimming lesson today either.

391
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:19,881
Anyway, she'll leave again.

392
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:33,425
I have to go to work, we'll talk later.

393
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,899
Why are you here?
You have class at 5:00.

394
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:18,541
You had nothing better to do!

395
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,700
I'm early.

396
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:41,420
You went to the pool anyway?

397
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:42,966
Good boy.

398
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:46,960
I have to get a medical certificate,

399
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,038
it costs 60 Euro.

400
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:53,166
Same story every year! When?

401
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,675
The 14th.

402
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,642
I can take him.

403
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:59,840
Want mummy to go with you?

404
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:08,648
Viola told me the news
about your work.

405
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:10,817
Yes...

406
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:14,954
I work for myself,
I bought the equipment

407
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:17,623
and had a chat with the bank...

408
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:23,297
You don't work with those guys?

409
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:27,968
I cut them all loose.

410
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,340
It's a calculated risk,

411
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,345
I have some important gigs lined up,

412
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,984
I'm closing a big job tomorrow.

413
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,245
Things are good.

414
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,996
There's a new game.

415
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,965
What?

416
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,537
It's awesome.

417
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,402
On PlayStation it's the best.

418
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,340
The graphics are cool.

419
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:04,906
Come sit here Tommaso.

420
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:06,777
Can't you see I'm sitting here?

421
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:11,547
Have a go at him!

422
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,051
Come in!

423
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:18,195
How cool, you came to visit!

424
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:24,057
Mum, your massage is over now.

425
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,328
- Tommi here.
- How are you?

426
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:27,630
Fine, thanks.

427
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:32,242
Just let me take care of this muscle.

428
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,401
Perfect! Come on.

429
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,178
I saw your sister yesterday
with a blonde lady.

430
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,409
Who is she?

431
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:43,610
My mother.

432
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:48,725
I thought you lived
with your sister and your dad?

433
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:51,657
She comes and goes.

434
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,024
Huh?

435
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:56,393
She comes and goes.

436
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:18,854
Here I am!

437
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,791
Ready to scrub the little cheese.

438
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,121
I can do it by myself.

439
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,594
Mummy's here now.

440
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:31,630
I'll wash your back, bend over.

441
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,504
Are you embarrassed?
You're hiding your willie?

442
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,841
I made this willie, it's mine!

443
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:46,073
Stop it!

444
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,445
Viola's right, you are stingy.

445
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,610
I'm going to do my homework.

446
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,915
You're leaving me here?

447
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,490
The male swordfish
falls in love with the female,

448
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,719
and when fishermen catch the female

449
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:02,662
he swims around the boat
until he's caught

450
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,927
because he wants to
stay with the female.

451
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:09,869
Then there's the Orang-utan.

452
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,340
He only falls in love to reproduce.

453
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:18,039
Afterwards,
he takes a piece of forest

454
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:23,585
and stays there all alone.

455
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,780
I included humans too,

456
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:29,289
because men and women
are the only ones

457
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,987
who don't approach one
another out of shyness.

458
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:41,360
See you tomorrow.

459
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,322
Dad

460
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:02,617
Where were you all afternoon?

461
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,091
At Antonio's.

462
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:09,664
You're always at his house!

463
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,028
Your mum just got back,

464
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:18,266
spend some time with her,

465
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,967
show her some affection.

466
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,740
Keeping this family together
depends on you too.

467
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:39,186
I'm working in a nice place Saturday,

468
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:41,194
you're all coming with me.

469
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:44,027
Will you honour us
with your presence?

470
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,691
Thanks

471
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,701
Here.

472
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,542
Can I carry this?

473
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:53,803
Yes

474
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,211
What's the camel for?

475
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,215
It's a sort of fake desert.

476
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:03,717
How are you, Flaviano?

477
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:06,379
I heard you took the plunge.

478
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,656
Let's recapitulate,
it's getting late.

479
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,265
We'll start with the car, it leaves,

480
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:20,369
we follow it beyond the camel

481
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,766
until it exits the scene.

482
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,429
That's it. Ready.

483
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,871
Silence!

484
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:29,707
Tommi, come here.

485
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,645
Alberto, a suggestion,

486
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,788
I'd start with the animal's snout,

487
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:42,187
because the camel is lovely,
then pan to the car.

488
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:47,092
No, start with the car, follow it,

489
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,925
then show the camel
but keep following the car.

490
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,067
I'll do a lead-in on the camel,

491
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,760
you can always cut it.

492
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:59,205
The camel's terrific
but we need the car.

493
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:06,476
Gimme a drink.

494
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:10,877
You look awesome!

495
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,455
The director doesn't know shit.

496
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:16,354
Can we ride the camel after?

497
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:17,527
We'll see.

498
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:18,823
Mum, I want to ride it with you.

499
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,486
ok

500
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:24,862
Everyone in place, rolling.

501
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:34,303
All right.

502
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:41,478
How about that shot we decided upon?

503
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:44,644
Look how amazing
this animal's snout is!

504
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,050
Just try this shot...

505
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:48,157
We get the idea, you like the camel,

506
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:51,453
but we need the car!

507
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,655
Look at the snout from this angle,
let's do it!

508
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,823
Let me do it, it won't take long,

509
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,059
you can cut it after.

510
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:01,033
We don't care about the camel's head.

511
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:05,198
The car, did I make myself clear?

512
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:08,072
Shoot the fucking car.

513
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:12,204
Calm down, I understand!

514
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,647
Do I have to get pissed off?

515
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:19,448
You just have to respect the people
who work for you!

516
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:23,616
Fine, let's do this car!

517
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:26,929
Who is this?

518
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:27,930
Who is he?

519
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,796
Renato Benetti, cameraman.

520
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:33,664
Mr. Benetti is costing us time,

521
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:37,238
the only thing he does
is harp about the camel shot!

522
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:41,037
We'll take care of it.

523
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:47,415
Start the car.
What's going on with the steadycam?

524
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:49,279
It's leaving.

525
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,871
Let's stop for a drink,

526
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,634
they'll call me
and beg me to come back.

527
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,973
They'll never find
another steadycam in time.

528
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:20,845
If they apologize,
maybe we'll go back.

529
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:25,949
Why was that guy such an arsehole?

530
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:28,523
He didn't want him
to shoot the camel.

531
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:33,095
They think everyone's willing
to let themselves be walked over.

532
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:37,097
Not Renato Benetti.

533
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,809
Take a guess...

534
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:54,810
What are you saying? No!

535
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,084
I don't know yet.

536
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:01,782
I can't talk now,
I'll call you tomorrow.

537
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:06,362
Who was it?

538
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:07,762
Livia.

539
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,564
You still hear from her?

540
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:16,501
Well, she's is our neighbour!

541
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:19,972
I ran into her at the supermarket.

542
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:21,811
Supermarket?

543
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,503
Yes

544
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:27,214
I see.

545
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:39,423
We've waited long enough,

546
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:41,965
time's up.

547
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:47,601
If they make problems for me,
I'll talk to the Union.

548
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,466
Half-wit, half...

549
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,471
Don't worry, baby.

550
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:56,136
You did the right thing,
he's lucky you didn't smack him.

551
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,214
Everything's fine.

552
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:10,953
What a moron!

553
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:23,673
This place is nice.

554
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,968
Yeah, real nice.

555
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,908
Ma'am?

556
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:34,217
Yes?

557
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:35,685
Do you have rooms available?

558
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:39,789
Anything you'd like,
two adjoining rooms?

559
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:42,391
Perfect, we'll stay.

560
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,526
Thanks.

561
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,360
We're sleeping here? How cool!

562
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,588
Can we go to the beach?

563
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:50,699
Go ahead, we'll be right there.

564
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:04,640
70 Euro for mum and dad's room,

565
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:10,776
70 for ours, that's 140 Euro!

566
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:14,253
He's such a scrooge!

567
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:23,231
Can't see a thing.

568
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:26,526
What do you think they're doing?

569
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:28,261
Sleeping.

570
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:32,340
Making love, stupid!

571
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,370
Wanna play a game?

572
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:35,806
Which?

573
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,043
Fuck off!

574
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:41,912
Look up.

575
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:44,477
What lovely eyes!

576
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:47,681
Just like your mother's.

577
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:54,156
Open your mouth.

578
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:56,231
Tongue out.

579
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,135
You can get dressed.

580
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:10,507
Has he had all the usual illnesses?

581
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:12,706
Mumps...

582
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:17,013
Mumps? Yes, remember Tommi?

583
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:18,745
Chickenpox?

584
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:21,720
Chickenpox, no.

585
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,723
Little red bumps...

586
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:24,894
No.

587
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:29,490
Yes, I had it,
but you weren't there.

588
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,034
I scratched and it left a scar.

589
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:37,936
Course I was there!
I just forgot, silly me.

590
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:14,027
Were you scared?

591
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,297
A bit.

592
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:18,839
I was hungry.

593
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:24,343
Why didn't you have dinner?

594
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:34,916
You don't love me anymore, do you?

595
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,894
Why don't you love me?

596
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:42,728
I wanted to take you with me.

597
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:45,868
Know what your father said?

598
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,036
That if I tried to,

599
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:53,438
he'd shoot me in the mouth.

600
00:51:57,848 --> 00:52:01,181
You mustn't judge me.

601
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:04,411
I was young when I got pregnant.

602
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:05,588
One baby after the other,

603
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:07,952
I felt like a cow.

604
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:14,095
I didn't want to
dump everything on Renato.

605
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:19,996
Honey, come to mommy.

606
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:24,666
You know what's important?

607
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:26,706
That I'm here now

608
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:28,310
and I'm not going to leave again,

609
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,537
I won't leave you again.

610
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,146
Your head hurts?

611
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,810
Yes

612
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:44,120
As usual, you know I'm a bit fragile,
like Renato says.

613
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:46,660
Want a massage?

614
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:50,027
Really?
You'll give me a massage?

615
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,065
Thanks

616
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,267
What a dear.

617
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,467
"She was proud yet resentful
of her husband's betrayals,

618
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:02,203
mercilessly pursuing

619
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:06,042
his lovers and their children."

620
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:08,081
Claudio,

621
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:12,250
do you feel like reading?

622
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,286
Tommi

623
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,588
"Poseidon, Zeus' brother,
and god of the sea,

624
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:25,030
dwelled in an underwater palace
where he bred..."

625
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:33,342
Benetti's mother would like
to speak to you.

626
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:34,343
Right now?

627
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:37,939
Excuse me, morning.

628
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:40,981
I've come for my son, where is he?

629
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:43,381
Over there!

630
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,052
Did something happen?

631
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:54,254
I need to take him with me.

632
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:56,194
Now?

633
00:53:56,366 --> 00:54:00,564
You know I've been away
for such a long time...

634
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:04,229
We're in class now,

635
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:07,968
we meet with parents on Thursday.
- Great.

636
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:11,204
I'd be glad to talk to you then,

637
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:12,643
Thursday afternoon.

638
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:14,807
Can I take him with me?
Do I have to sign anything?

639
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:16,316
Yes. Luciano will you show her

640
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:19,989
to the office?

641
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:20,990
Ok.

642
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:24,483
Tommaso, gather your things and go.

643
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:29,520
Isn't this girl adorable!

644
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:32,964
I've got something for you,
share them with the others.

645
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:40,902
See you tomorrow, Tommaso.

646
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:44,979
Goodbye.

647
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:51,718
Thank you.

648
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:56,852
What's going on?

649
00:54:57,027 --> 00:55:00,087
I kidnapped you to spend

650
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:01,753
time alone together, happy?

651
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,421
Yes.

652
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:07,635
Where are we going?

653
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,965
You decide.

654
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,542
You can skip
your swimming lesson today.

655
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:16,076
Who's going to tell dad?

656
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:17,804
I will.

657
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:23,117
It's closed?

658
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:25,880
Unbelievable!

659
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:31,158
Nobody's here. Excuse me!

660
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,955
Why's everything closed?

661
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:35,825
We open at 3:00.

662
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,799
Fantastic!
Should we wait or take a drive?

663
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,129
We could wait.

664
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:44,899
Let's go over there.

665
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:50,236
There's a lake with ducks, remember?

666
00:55:57,454 --> 00:56:00,946
They like it, come on over!

667
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,123
Tommi

668
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:11,862
Give them some crackers.

669
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:15,300
They love crackers! Taking a dip?

670
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:19,033
I want to take them home!

671
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:43,759
No fighting.

672
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:46,026
You come with me.

673
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:49,000
Take out what you were
working on last lesson

674
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:59,811
Mind if I sit here?

675
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:04,010
Yes

676
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,627
What are you making?

677
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,338
I'm not sure yet.

678
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:34,047
I'm making a vase for dried flowers.

679
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,952
You're sweet for
being nice to Claudio.

680
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,121
I like him.

681
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:54,100
Tommi and Monica
are going out with one another!

682
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,794
Go back to kindergarten!

683
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:59,373
What fools! You're more mature.

684
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:04,638
Are you shy?

685
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,080
No

686
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:12,748
Can I do something?

687
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,446
Yes

688
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:26,158
Now it looks like a dolphin.

689
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:31,200
I LOVE YOU

690
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:43,450
Marcella, where are the students?

691
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,679
At gym or ceramics.

692
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:48,153
Let's do the rubbish bins.

693
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:09,738
I kept pushing
but you didn't want to come out.

694
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:12,143
I cried like an hawk!

695
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:14,579
You were already a pain!

696
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:18,152
Know how much you weighed?
Four kilos.

697
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:20,983
You were like a calf!

698
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:24,854
But I didn't feel a thing with you.

699
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:26,222
Know what you did

700
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,727
when you came out of my tummy?

701
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,865
You peed on the nurse's face.

702
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:33,059
- Pisser!
- Good shot!

703
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,537
Good day

704
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:46,648
I was telling my kids
about when they were born.

705
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:50,115
I can't, I'm with them.

706
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:51,981
No, they'd get bored.

707
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:54,248
Where, doing what?

708
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:57,450
It's Viola.

709
00:59:57,627 --> 01:00:00,824
I'll think it over and let you know.

710
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:02,862
All right.

711
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:04,192
Who was it?

712
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:05,425
Livia.

713
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,797
Come on, let's go.

714
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:09,700
I like it! Where?

715
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:11,134
An art exhibit.

716
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:14,674
Can we go, please?

717
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:18,507
Please, let's go!

718
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:24,983
The kids are begging to go
to the exhibit with Livia

719
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,257
This afternoon.

720
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:35,021
Yes, you're right,
I'll get out a bit.

721
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:40,963
Yes, sure, we'll be home by 6:00.

722
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:05,594
Excuse me.

723
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:09,497
You bugger, you never visit,
I should spank you!

724
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,759
You're beautiful!

725
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:13,333
Heavens, all these kids!

726
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,095
Antonio's a friend of Tommi's.

727
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:16,397
Good day

728
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:20,372
How you've grown!
A kiss for your godmother.

729
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:22,374
Hit the buffet.

730
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,513
Looks like a dolphin to me.

731
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,615
Looks like a lard-arse!

732
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:29,752
What imagination...

733
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:32,782
Yuck!

734
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:37,951
How can you tell?

735
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:54,543
I have great news,

736
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,645
my father's buying me a dog.

737
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:01,615
It's from a litter of seven.

738
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:04,116
Why don't you get one too?

739
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:08,087
You even have a big terrace,
it's perfect.

740
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:10,851
A dog, that's all we need!

741
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:13,928
Bye, darling.

742
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,490
You got a ticket.

743
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:22,433
Throw it away, I won't pay it anyway.

744
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:29,539
They were nice.

745
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:30,974
They're show-offs.

746
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:32,409
Why?

747
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,482
Don't know, they just are.

748
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,813
That guy is loaded.

749
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:29,294
Let go! Kids, time to eat.

750
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:35,972
So when's the swimming race?

751
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,942
The 27th or 29th.

752
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:41,914
Two weeks? Go, my champion!

753
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:44,075
I sat in your spot.

754
01:03:44,854 --> 01:03:49,917
Come on stragglers, last sprint!

755
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:55,291
Lanes 4 and 5.

756
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:42,502
You lengthened your stroke,
bloody amazing,

757
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:45,112
you thrashed all of them!

758
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:46,339
Thrashed them...

759
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:49,609
I timed you, you thrashed them.

760
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:52,413
It's going to be a sorry race
for the others.

761
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:57,582
This is beyond football!
There's Viola.

762
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,593
Daddy's darling.

763
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:01,855
Hello my lovelies.

764
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:03,198
How did it go?

765
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:04,496
Fine.

766
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:08,267
Did you shake your legs,
did you do a plie?

767
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:11,531
A whatchamacallit, a chignon?

768
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:13,538
Yes, right.

769
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:20,714
I'm tired, carry it for me?

770
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:22,817
I'm not your mule!

771
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:25,852
Dad, why is Tommi such a rude pig?

772
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:29,454
I ask myself that every night.

773
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:48,674
My stomach is growling!

774
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:50,539
It's time to eat.
I'm starved.

775
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:52,613
I was freezing today at work,

776
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:55,876
they had me standing around
like a dickhead for hours.

777
01:05:57,253 --> 01:06:00,313
The lights at home are all off.

778
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:03,756
The lights?

779
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:07,191
The lights are all off at home.

780
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:15,529
You see them from outside?

781
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,431
I'm going.

782
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,171
Come here.

783
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,451
How did you sleep?

784
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:47,357
Fine.

785
01:07:50,766 --> 01:07:53,360
You slept fine...

786
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:03,672
Are you sure
you want to go to school?

787
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:11,584
Viola's sleeping,
go lie down in my bed.

788
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,483
No

789
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:25,532
Look Dad, I'm going.

790
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:32,365
Bye my little man, see you tonight.

791
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:33,906
Bye

792
01:08:37,913 --> 01:08:40,245
Bessi,
why didn't you do the homework?

793
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:46,355
My mum broke her finger
so we went to the hospital,

794
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:49,184
we didn't get home till 9:00.

795
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:51,519
Next year you're going to be
in 6th grade again.

796
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:56,631
Geography, open up to page 52.

797
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:05,229
We'll talk about city functions:

798
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:08,001
Political and administrative,

799
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,540
financial, economic,

800
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:18,720
and residential.

801
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:26,190
We also discussed city changes.

802
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:33,662
We spoke about the Roman city.

803
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,361
- Did you write it?
- No.

804
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,704
He's in the bathroom.

805
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:46,875
Monica's looking for you.

806
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:48,141
For me?

807
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:50,649
Yeah, it's about the note.

808
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:53,720
Hurry, she's really mad.

809
01:09:57,326 --> 01:10:00,921
He wrote it during ceramics class.

810
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:16,168
Were you looking for me?

811
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:20,408
I was kind of upset,

812
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:23,416
an anonymous note...

813
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:27,078
How was I supposed to know
you wrote it?

814
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:29,019
What note?

815
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:31,853
What do you mean? This note.

816
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:38,826
I didn't write it.

817
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:41,595
You didn't write it?

818
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,203
I had nothing to do with it.

819
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:51,404
They said you wrote it,
but maybe they're lying...

820
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:54,010
No

821
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:59,785
They even opened my backpack.

822
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:05,725
Well, bye.

823
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:38,685
Quiet or they'll catch us.

824
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,597
What's down there?

825
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:43,598
Where?

826
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:45,430
Down there.

827
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:48,533
Nothing.

828
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:50,035
Yeah, right.

829
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:03,216
You're crazy,
that's at least a 40,000 meter drop!

830
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:12,292
If my parents find out,
we're finished.

831
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,929
Then don't tell them.

832
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:45,525
What's this filth?

833
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:49,764
What is this filth?

834
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:53,592
You trying to kill me?

835
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:57,899
I'm not your slave,
nor your housekeeper!

836
01:12:58,073 --> 01:13:01,133
What is all this shit,
this rubbish on the floor?

837
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:04,245
And Dad cleans up, you two

838
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:09,043
wash a plate once in a while.

839
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:13,416
No fucking way,
it doesn't work like this!

840
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:16,057
I've been fucked over enough times
for one lifetime,

841
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:20,127
by everybody,
now you two want to have a go at it?

842
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:21,956
Be my guests!

843
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:23,530
Sorry, Dad.

844
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:26,725
We'll be neater.

845
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:33,370
I told you to clean up
this fucking mess two hours ago.

846
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:53,456
Get ready,
I convinced Dad to go jogging.

847
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:57,087
No, I'm going to the movies
with Antonio.

848
01:13:58,834 --> 01:13:59,834
Are we going?

849
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:02,768
Just me and you.

850
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:05,669
The three of us
need to stick together.

851
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:10,574
Get ready.

852
01:14:53,722 --> 01:14:55,690
- Get out!
- Dad, what does it matter?

853
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:57,886
Why are you sitting there
like an idiot?

854
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,785
Run, we'll see
if I can turn you into a man!

855
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:06,697
Run!

856
01:15:49,244 --> 01:15:52,111
Up you get champion,
today's your day.

857
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:56,575
I made you tea, milk's a bit heavy,
you know.

858
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:00,955
A royal breakfast today!

859
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:06,925
I made you an egg too,
it'll give you energy.

860
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:08,927
What time is warm up?

861
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:10,997
8:15

862
01:16:11,934 --> 01:16:13,959
Want some lemon?

863
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:22,106
Marcello said you have
the third best time.

864
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:25,075
You're the favourite for the heat.

865
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:28,414
What's the regional record?

866
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:31,849
1.2.

867
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:39,192
Bet you're gonna take all of them
for a ride in the final.

868
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:44,421
What do you think?

869
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:03,418
The other day I was thinking...

870
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:09,718
Why'd I get stuck
with a girl like her?

871
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,626
A girl whose pussy's
always itching for more.

872
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:25,568
It's absurd!

873
01:17:28,377 --> 01:17:31,574
Can you believe her?

874
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:37,284
She cries, comes crawling back
on her hands and knees:

875
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:39,818
"I've changed!"

876
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:42,252
What's changed?

877
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:45,018
What has changed?

878
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:46,592
I'm telling you this

879
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:49,959
because you're big, you understand.

880
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:57,796
Anyhow, I've always managed
to bounce back.

881
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:08,343
Eat up! Have some honey,

882
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:11,452
it gives you energy.

883
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:17,589
On the starting block,
shift your weight back,

884
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:20,023
or else you'll take forever to start.

885
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:22,720
Lean forward,
so when the race starts

886
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:25,332
you're already in the water,

887
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:26,524
they're still standing there.

888
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:28,397
Gotta go, they're in the pool.

889
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:38,875
Save some steam for the final.

890
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:41,538
They're all hopeless in your heat.

891
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:53,126
Tommi, 200m, nice and easy.

892
01:19:23,992 --> 01:19:26,927
Tommi and Francesco.

893
01:21:53,775 --> 01:21:56,300
I don't like swimming.

894
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:01,141
You're no son of mine.

895
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:07,687
My son wouldn't do something
like that.

896
01:22:07,856 --> 01:22:10,518
Do whatever the hell you want.

897
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:13,160
Then I want to quit.

898
01:22:13,328 --> 01:22:15,159
Who gives a shit!

899
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,964
Who gives a shit!

900
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:51,724
What are you doing there?

901
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,595
Nothing.

902
01:22:55,870 --> 01:22:58,100
Why didn't you ring?

903
01:22:58,273 --> 01:23:00,104
It's early.

904
01:23:00,275 --> 01:23:01,970
Antonio went to his grandma's

905
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:03,269
in Naples, she's not well,

906
01:23:03,445 --> 01:23:05,572
but he'll be back tonight.

907
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:07,544
Are you home alone?

908
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:10,276
No, they're home.

909
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:14,354
I'm going to the garage
to get my fishing gear,

910
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:16,456
have you ever been fishing?

911
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:19,920
I'm Antonio's father.

912
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:22,825
I ran into Tommi on the stairs,

913
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:27,435
I asked if he wanted
to come fishing with me.

914
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:31,038
Is it all right with you
if he comes with me?

915
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:32,696
No problem.

916
01:23:32,874 --> 01:23:33,932
I'll have him back tonight.

917
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:36,509
Right, no problem.

918
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:51,353
There it is!

919
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:55,053
Reel it in slowly.

920
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:59,860
Keep it tight.

921
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:05,302
Good job!

922
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:11,979
Let me pull out the hook.

923
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:18,111
How many have we caught?

924
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:22,121
This makes four.

925
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:24,781
We'll have a feast tonight!

926
01:24:24,959 --> 01:24:26,187
I have to catch one more.

927
01:24:26,361 --> 01:24:27,361
Why?

928
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:28,760
Antonio eats a lot.

929
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:30,420
You're right.

930
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:33,527
Here's the trout!

931
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:39,863
Dad, when we go...
to the mountains,

932
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:42,874
can we go fishing in that stream?

933
01:24:43,044 --> 01:24:46,707
What stream, it's a river!

934
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:48,849
Fishing in the freezing cold?

935
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:51,577
Wouldn't it be better
to warm up a bit skiing?

936
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:54,017
Just to stand out from the crowd.

937
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:55,781
Do you like skiing?

938
01:24:55,957 --> 01:24:57,618
I've never been.

939
01:24:57,792 --> 01:25:00,056
It's really amazing!

940
01:25:00,228 --> 01:25:02,594
It'd be nice if you came with us.

941
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,891
You have to, can he daddy?

942
01:25:05,066 --> 01:25:08,433
You're asking me?
I'd take him everywhere!

943
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:14,399
Go to church, hypocrites!

944
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:18,672
Takes courage to accept the fact
that we're dead flesh,

945
01:25:18,847 --> 01:25:21,645
decaying flesh.

946
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:25,351
A nice warm revolver
one of these days,

947
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,216
and we'll end it all.

948
01:25:28,389 --> 01:25:31,517
There I'll be,
finally face to face with the Eternal.

949
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:37,955
The Almighty...

950
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,931
Almighty, my arse!

951
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:43,093
What time is it?

952
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:48,903
5:10.

953
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:58,650
Where's my jacket?

954
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:04,358
Where the hell is it?

955
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:07,624
Where is my striped jacket?

956
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:09,558
Disappeared.

957
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:14,629
I managed to get a gig in Naples.

958
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:18,834
I left 50 Euro on the table
for dance class.

959
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:23,068
Tell them I'll pay the rest next time.

960
01:26:23,244 --> 01:26:25,576
Tell that wuss, your brother

961
01:26:25,747 --> 01:26:31,151
to go earn money himself
for his snack. Go to bed.

962
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:39,853
I left some omelette for you.

963
01:26:41,262 --> 01:26:45,255
I'm going out with Brunella,
want to come?

964
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:48,232
You're staying home alone?

965
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:49,995
Yes.

966
01:26:50,171 --> 01:26:52,469
Bye, sugar.

967
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:04,643
I thought we had a deal?

968
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:08,721
Ma'am, you're making a mistake.

969
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:14,123
Allow me to say
you're making a mistake,

970
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:20,495
you won't find anyone else like me.

971
01:27:20,668 --> 01:27:23,102
I'll bring the steadycam.

972
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:24,829
All right, thanks.

973
01:27:39,153 --> 01:27:41,018
Dad?

974
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:50,661
What is it?

975
01:27:51,532 --> 01:27:55,059
Antonio invited me on a skiing trip.

976
01:27:57,071 --> 01:27:59,539
What?

977
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:04,467
Can I go away on a skiing trip?

978
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:08,908
When?

979
01:28:09,717 --> 01:28:12,481
They're leaving in two days.

980
01:28:16,758 --> 01:28:19,192
Are you serious?

981
01:28:21,562 --> 01:28:24,326
Are you serious?

982
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:29,401
What the fuck!

983
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:33,370
We're drowning in debt,
we're about to lose our house,

984
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:38,604
I'm up to my eyeballs in shit
and you wanna go skiing?

985
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:41,214
They're paying.

986
01:28:41,849 --> 01:28:46,343
They're paying?
What the fuck are you saying?

987
01:28:48,456 --> 01:28:49,684
Calm down!

988
01:28:49,857 --> 01:28:53,020
Bastards, God almighty!

989
01:28:53,194 --> 01:28:55,162
Traitor!

990
01:28:57,532 --> 01:28:59,864
Get out of this house,
son of a bitch!

991
01:29:00,034 --> 01:29:04,027
Go stay with your fucking friend!

992
01:29:04,205 --> 01:29:06,998
- Sorry!
- Get out!

993
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:10,269
Get out of this house!

994
01:30:00,361 --> 01:30:04,388
Fantastic! Let's go tell my mum!

995
01:30:07,635 --> 01:30:10,126
Tommi's coming with us.

996
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:13,102
What great news!

997
01:30:13,274 --> 01:30:15,469
Did I hear correctly?

998
01:30:15,643 --> 01:30:17,372
Wonderful, aren't you happy?

999
01:30:17,545 --> 01:30:18,910
No doubt!

1000
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,241
Know what we'll do?

1001
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:24,579
We'll have dinner at auntie's,
then you'll sleep over

1002
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:26,947
and we'll leave early in the morning.

1003
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:29,453
We'll call your dad tomorrow,

1004
01:30:29,624 --> 01:30:32,889
since he barely knows us.

1005
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:10,790
Anyone home?

1006
01:32:11,092 --> 01:32:15,324
We have to remember
to pick up the other snowsuit,

1007
01:32:15,496 --> 01:32:17,726
so we'll have an extra one.

1008
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:19,696
Already got it.

1009
01:32:21,302 --> 01:32:23,395
Surprised, aren't you?

1010
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:32,903
I'm setting the alarm for 6:00.

1011
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,843
No kidding!

1012
01:32:35,016 --> 01:32:38,315
You can bring us
breakfast in bed then.

1013
01:32:39,487 --> 01:32:43,389
I can't believe
we'll be in the mountains tomorrow.

1014
01:34:34,535 --> 01:34:36,230
Dad?

1015
01:34:41,242 --> 01:34:42,573
Dad?

1016
01:34:48,082 --> 01:34:49,481
Dad?

1017
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,405
What is it?

1018
01:35:23,517 --> 01:35:25,382
What's wrong?

1019
01:35:30,024 --> 01:35:32,458
Are you okay?

1020
01:35:51,011 --> 01:35:53,844
My little boy!

1021
01:35:57,284 --> 01:35:59,582
It's all right.

1022
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:03,053
Understand? It's nothing.

1023
01:36:07,128 --> 01:36:08,993
My boy!

1024
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:14,934
I love you.

1025
01:36:16,003 --> 01:36:18,369
I love you.

1026
01:36:19,306 --> 01:36:22,605
Where did I put it?

1027
01:36:27,748 --> 01:36:29,272
Here it is.

1028
01:36:32,953 --> 01:36:35,922
I went yesterday, it's a nice place.

1029
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:38,581
There are two footy fields,
it's nearby.

1030
01:36:38,759 --> 01:36:40,659
There were tons of kids.

1031
01:36:40,828 --> 01:36:45,197
They were all wearing
those neon yellow thingies.

1032
01:36:45,366 --> 01:36:46,890
Bibs

1033
01:36:47,067 --> 01:36:50,662
Bibs?

1034
01:36:50,838 --> 01:36:55,775
Out of curiosity,
what position do you wanna play?

1035
01:36:57,978 --> 01:37:00,071
striker

1036
01:37:04,418 --> 01:37:07,285
I like sweeper.

1037
01:37:08,856 --> 01:37:11,757
Sweeper's a nice position.

1038
01:37:18,265 --> 01:37:20,756
Sweeper's good too.

1039
01:37:26,106 --> 01:37:28,734
But I'll sign up next year,

1040
01:37:28,909 --> 01:37:32,401
we already paid
for a year of swimming.

1041
01:38:26,233 --> 01:38:27,757
Benetti?

1042
01:38:31,071 --> 01:38:34,563
Your mother passed by,
she left this package.

1043
01:38:36,610 --> 01:38:40,205
Wake up sleepyhead, take it!

1044
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:41,381
Bye!

1045
01:38:41,482 --> 01:38:42,710
Bye!

1046
01:38:51,992 --> 01:38:55,792
Why didn't you go skiing
for the winter break?

1047
01:38:55,963 --> 01:38:58,022
Because I didn't.

1048
01:39:54,588 --> 01:39:56,283
MY LOVE, MOMMY'S ALWAYS WITH YOU.

1049
01:39:56,457 --> 01:39:58,789
YOU'RE THE ONLY MAN IN MY LIFE.

1050
01:39:58,959 --> 01:40:00,756
I'M NOT WELL,

1051
01:40:00,928 --> 01:40:02,828
BUT ONE DAY
I'LL EXPLAIN.

1052
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:04,464
I LOVE YOU.
