1
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,240
Goodbye. Till tomorrow.

2
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,600
No, I'm taking a boat
to South America tonight.

3
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,120
How long will you be gone?
A couple of months.

4
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,520
I got the university to send me.
Why didn't you tell me?

5
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,160
I wanted to cut it sharp
with a knife. But why?

6
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,360
You know why. I don't like hiding.

7
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,880
Why?

8
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,920
Come with me.

9
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,360
Just like that? Just like that.

10
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,400
The captain will marry us
on the boat.

11
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,800
Mark, it sounds so crazy
and wonderful but...

12
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,120
You won't say a word to anybody,

13
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,480
you'll go and pack and meet me
on the boat at eight o'clock.

14
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,360
Will I, Mark? Will you, Barbara?

15
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,680
Yes!

16
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,600
WOMAN: Barbara, you're late.
I'm sorry, Aunt Eulah.

17
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,040
Come here for a moment, my dear.

18
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,080
We are having company for dinner.
I have invited Monsieur Duchaine.

19
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,880
Monsieur Duchaine is a fine man,
my dear, a great gentleman.
Yes, Aunt Eulah.

20
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,920
It is proper

21
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,480
that money should be a large
consideration in your marriage.

22
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,080
You may wear your new dress.
Thank you, Aunt Eulah.

23
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,600
MAN: Thank you, Robbie.

24
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,120
In a hurry, Cousin?

25
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,000
Paul!

26
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,520
Yes, Mother.

27
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,840
We're dining at home, you know.

28
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,600
Aren't you wearing your new dress,
Cousin dear?

29
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,640
Is it necessary to pack a suitcase
to go down to dinner?

30
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,760
I'm going away, Paul.

31
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,440
Oh, that's what the suitcase is for.

32
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:39,720
Is it that research fellow, Barbara,
from the university? How did you
know? I thought nobody knew.

33
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,320
Well, you're my favourite cousin!

34
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,120
Is it by any chance the boat
that sails tonight at eight o'clock?

35
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,160
I'd better see you off, it's not au
fait for a young lady to go alone.

36
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,920
What's the matter? You're not
going to tell your mother?

37
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,000
Her heart.

38
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,560
As a matter of a fact she won't
have an attack immediately, not
until your entire story comes out.

39
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,040
You don't intend, of course, to
come back to New Orleans. Why not?

40
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:18,560
You'd be a figure of some notoriety.
People would dig into your...
shall we say, ancestry.

41
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,520
Well, Mother's old, she hadn't
many years to live anyhow.

42
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,200
I don't blame you for wanting
to live your own life.

43
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,240
You don't blame me?

44
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,600
You don't blame anyone as long
as it doesn't interfere with you.

45
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,040
I don't know whether you should
write Dear Mark or Dear Doctor.

46
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,400
"Darling". Of course,
that's much more simple and direct.

47
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,440
Very sweet.

48
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,800
Very commendable.

49
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,320
And you will always be here,
waiting.

50
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:11,280
Mother might ask questions
if you whisper with the servants.
I'll see that it gets to the ship.

51
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,240
Promise, Paul.

52
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,120
I promise, Barbara.

53
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,680
You'll be lovely in your new dress,
Cousin dear!

54
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,960
< Lower your gangplank!
Lower your gangplank!

55
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,400
< Stand by your lines!

56
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,600
AUNT: Nowadays, Mr Duchaine,
it's considered old-fashioned

57
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:48,320
to be proud of one's origins.
Well, Madame, I prefer to be
considered old-fashioned.

58
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,520
I feel it's our duty to remember
our heritage and be proud of it.

59
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,600
SHIP'S HOOTER BLOWS

60
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:10,120
You know, Clay, whenever Barbara
hears a ship's whistle at
eight o'clock, she spills her soup.

61
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,560
# The spirits creep

62
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,480
# The ghosties run

63
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,320
# The skeletons rattle and moan

64
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,360
# The goblins holler... #
Where's 39, Elisa Street?

65
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,320
# Takes magic to scare off
dead bones... # Thank you.

66
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:44,280
Buy a cute little skeleton
for Halloween? Do I look like a man
who'd buy a skeleton? No, sir.

67
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,480
Why don't you look
where you're going? Why don't YOU!

68
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,200
# Goblins holler
on All Saints Eve... #

69
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,400
Is this number 39? Yes, sir.
Does a Barbara Beaurevel live here?

70
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,440
All the Beaurevels live here, sir.
Miss, Madame and the Mister.
Thank you.

71
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,160
My dear man, I suggest that
you find yourself an attorney.

72
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,520
"Luther Toplady. Attorney at law."

73
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:29,840
Well, Mr Luther Toplady,
I don't think you have any action
against me.

74
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,320
I'm not even interested in you,
unless your name is Barbara.

75
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,640
Barbara? I've come all the way from
California to see her. Paul! Yes,
Mother? I wish to see the gentleman.

76
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:47,880
Mr Toplady. From California.
Your business, please?
Are you Barbara Beaurevel?

77
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:55,000
We are the only Beaurevels in New
Orleans. I'm tracing the relatives
of a lady who died. A Mrs Crandall.

78
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,840
We have no Crandalls in our family.
This is a matter of a bequest.

79
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,200
I've traced a Barbara Beaurevel
to this address. Good day.

80
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,920
Mother, you might listen.
All the diamonds in Africa couldn't
join Carrie Crandall to my family.

81
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,960
I'm sure you'll forgive me
for asking how you knew
I meant Carrie Crandall?

82
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,840
I see that you have your hat...
I came 3,000 miles to see
Barbara Beaurevel and...

83
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,880
Barbara Beaurevel is dead!

84
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,320
Good day, Madam.

85
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:44,720
I'm afraid you don't understand our
traditions. The older I grow, the
more I see, the less I understand.

86
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,600
Yes, I'm sure life
is much more simple in California.
Aunt Eulah!

87
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,800
Isn't that.... Goodbye, Mr Toplady!

88
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,480
Aunt Eulah... Barbara,
do not come rushing down the stairs,
it's extremely unbecoming.

89
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:08,600
You saw the gentleman who just left
this house? Yes. You're not to see
him again even if he asks for you.

90
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:15,640
He talked about your unsavoury
relation. Paul! Can't we even
shake Barbara's skeleton in private?

91
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:21,400
There's some sordid bequest
I said you were dead.
We don't need the money.

92
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:28,440
That's not funny, Paul. I agree.
I'd like permission to meet
Cousin Philippe's boat. Alone?

93
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:34,600
It's just to meet a boat.
You didn't see him off when
he left for South America. May I?

94
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,240
Clay wouldn't like it.
I'm not married to Clay!

95
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,480
He can't object if you accompany
her. I shall be happy to carry you
to the boat, Cousin.

96
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:51,520
Paul is always charming! Tell
Philippe he must come to dinner!
I'll see if the carriage is ready.

97
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,040
Paul!

98
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,680
Mmm?

99
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,920
The gangplank isn't down yet.

100
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:29,000
You know, when you're eager
and excited, you're wonderfully
pretty! Am I, Paul?

101
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,760
I wish I had a nice dress. I could
do with some new shoes, myself.

102
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,280
Oh, dear, what a lucky fellow he is.
Who? My cousin Philippe, of course.

103
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,400
It's a pity you haven't got money,
I'd marry you myself.

104
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,920
Oh, that's a very interesting idea!
They're coming ashore!

105
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:55,240
You're the most attractive woman
I've ever seen. You should make
something out of it.

106
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,880
I'm sure you'll make sure that I do!

107
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,080
Here he is, right in front of you.
Hello, Philippe!

108
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,640
How extremely nice of you to come!

109
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:19,320
Barbara insisted. Welcome home,
Philippe. My dear beautiful cousin!
Aunt Eulah wants you to dinner.

110
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,480
How extremely kind of her.

111
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,440
Oh, you want to get
through customs quickly.

112
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:36,240
Paul, help Philippe.
I imagine you'll find something
to do till I get back.

113
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,280
Mark!

114
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:44,880
Darling, it's been so long! Has it?
Two months can be a lifetime.
I never knew that before.

115
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:52,400
How is your dear family(?)
Oh, Corinne, this is Miss Beaurevel.
My wife.

116
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,240
How do you do?

117
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,520
How do you do? I believe
you're the first native
of New Orleans my wife has met.

118
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,560
It's like eating the core of the
apple before taking the first bite.

119
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:11,600
I'm glad we married
before coming here
if they're all as pretty as you are.

120
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,720
They're not, and besides,
they're most undependable,

121
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:22,560
wouldn't you say so, Miss Beaurevel?
Would you, Dr Lucas?
Possibly only the great beauties.

122
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,560
Delighted to have seen you,
Miss Beaurevel. Goodbye.

123
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,120
Hello, Dean Casley.
I didn't expect to be met.
I'm anxious to get your reports.

124
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,760
Barbara, you must be practical.

125
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,120
You're well out of it  the man
has neither family nor money.

126
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:01,560
I admit he might be famous some day
but let other people have the fame,
luxury is much more pleasant.

127
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,320
I don't know what's going on
under that pretty hat,

128
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,760
but Mother is right when she talks
about a good name. Paul...

129
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,080
Hmm? Do you mind if I don't come in?
I'd like to take a drive. Alone.

130
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,200
Don't do any thinking, it's bad for
the complexion. All right, Pappy.

131
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,240
Where to, Miss Barbie?

132
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,280
I'll tell you on the way.

133
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,120
Is Mr Toplady registered here, sir?

134
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:45,240
Yes. Would you ask him to come
to the ladies' parlour, please?
Yes, madam. This way, Miss Barbie.

135
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,440
Your name IS Barbara. Wait
outside the door, Pappy. I'll be
in shouting distance, Miss Barbie.

136
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,400
Thank you, that's a great comfort.

137
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,880
Won't you sit down, Miss Beaurevel?

138
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,160
May I get you some coffee?
No, thank you.

139
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,080
Do you know
what Carrie Crandall was?

140
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:25,480
She was a sister of James McDougall
who has died leaving a bequest
to her heirs.

141
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,080
I am Carrie Crandall's
granddaughter.

142
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,720
Well?

143
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:42,960
I'm delighted to find someone who
admits Carrie Crandall ever existed!
My aunt has been deathly afraid

144
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,600
that it would come out
that my grandmother was...

145
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,640
Such a notorious woman.

146
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,080
They even point at her grave
and make jokes.

147
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,760
Even now I'm not sure
that Aunt Eulah isn't right.

148
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,800
If the truth were known,

149
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:04,040
I couldn't live in New Orleans
any more. Would it be so terrible?
I think I should die!

150
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:11,360
I don't think you'll be forced into
an early suicide. There's no need
of court action or publicity.

151
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,520
Carrie Crandall's daughter entered
into a convent under a false name

152
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,000
and married your father
under that false name,

153
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,880
I have documented proof of this.
Furthermore, you resemble
your grandmother greatly.

154
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,320
You knew her?

155
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
That's how I recognised you.

156
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,360
Imagine her with your complexion,
with your proud look.

157
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,320
I didn't know I had a proud look.

158
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,360
Just as she had.

159
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:43,560
She married a gambler. He left
her before the child was born.

160
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,120
She did whatever she had to
for the welfare of the little girl,

161
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,560
even to hiding her own motherhood
and love.

162
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,960
But she was... Yes, she was.

163
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,600
So if because of what she was
you refuse the inheritance... No!

164
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:05,840
In spite of your aunt's wishes
you still want the money? Yes.
The estate can be easily liquidated,

165
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,400
it comes from gold. Is there much?

166
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,160
By certain standards, yes. How much?

167
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,880
A little over...900,000 dollars.

168
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,240
When do I get it?

169
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,440
I'll have the papers ready
for your signature tomorrow.

170
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,560
At first I thought Toplady
was a silly name but now I love it!

171
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,760
Miss Beaurevel... Yes?

172
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,880
I'm not sure I like the feeling
behind your smile.

173
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,640
I trust you'll use the money wisely?

174
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,920
I will. I can promise you I will!

175
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,320
CLAY: Why should I finance you
in a brokerage house, Paul?

176
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,040
I'd be very good at it
and would make you a lot of money.

177
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,880
I don't need any more money.
That's where we differ.

178
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:07,400
Miss Beaurevel. Mr Duchaine has been
waiting for you, Barbara. I'm sorry.
You're always worth waiting for.

179
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Would you mind if I talked to
Barbara alone? Why, of course not.

180
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,320
Well? I wanted to make sure
about the costume ball tonight.

181
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,400
I hadn't forgotten.
I'll come by at ten. No, Clay.

182
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,440
There's somewhere I'd like
to go first, alone. Is that wise?

183
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,080
It's what I'm going to do.

184
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,840
There's something different
about you, Barbara.

185
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,920
I don't know quite how to say it.

186
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,440
It's as though there was a secret
that warms you.

187
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,480
Do you mind?

188
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,920
I mind nothing that you do or are.

189
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:53,360
Even the fact that my family wants
me to marry you for your money?

190
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,480
If being poor puts them on my side,

191
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,840
I'm glad they're poor.

192
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,080
If you'll marry me, Barbara,

193
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:09,560
I'll do anything you want. I'll be
anything you want. I like you, Clay,
better than I ever have before.

194
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,600
Goodbye, Clay.

195
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,920
Say goodbye to your aunt for me.

196
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:27,560
You must be out of your mind.
You WERE listening, weren't you?
Where are you going before the ball?

197
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:34,240
If you listened carefully,
you'll know I didn't even tell Clay.
You'll lose him.

198
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,880
And then where would
your brokerage business be?

199
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:44,920
We don't approve of your going
anywhere alone. That's too bad
because nobody's coming with me!

200
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,320
PEOPLE SING AND SHOUT

201
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,120
CHILDREN SHOUT: Trick or treat!

202
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:19,920
BOY SINGS: # Light a candle
for your loved one... #

203
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,160
MARK: You explain it to her, Dean.

204
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:33,240
All Souls' Eve is what you call
Halloween up north. To us
it's a religious occasion

205
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,160
but there are enough
goblins and imps so that
we don't treat it too soberly.

206
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,000
..On this night one lights a candle
to one's dear departed.

207
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,960
Are you alone?

208
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,240
Isn't everyone?

209
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:21,960
You're a philosopher now?
I thought you didn't believe in
these barbaric ceremonies. I don't.

210
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,280
Then why did you come?

211
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:32,880
My wife. Strangers like to see
the superstitious customs
of this primitive society.

212
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:40,280
That's an interesting smile you're
wearing. Do you still want to cut
it sharp with a knife? Cut what?

213
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,880
You don't remember. Suppose I do?

214
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,720
It was such a long time ago. A
lifetime. We barely knew each other.

215
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:54,200
We only saw each other every day
for month after month.
And still I didn't know you.

216
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,040
That may be because you're afraid
to know yourself.

217
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,600
I found out one thing... Oh?

218
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,040
You're not much of a letter writer,
are you?

219
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,600
Who is?

220
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,040
I know something else. Fascinating.
What? You're still holding my hand.

221
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:18,080
Well, you haven't gone
into a physical decline. Then you
still approve of something about me.

222
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:24,760
Beautiful hair, warm complexion,
exciting figure  if a man
could see it in those clothes.

223
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,760
But you decided it wasn't worth
waiting for. I decided?!

224
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,600
I suppose it wasn't you
who got married? Well?

225
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:42,440
Why did you? I know she's awfully
pretty and boats are romantic...
They are. Try it some time.

226
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,160
I don't know why you did it,
but you couldn't have forgotten.

227
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,160
Not so soon. I haven't had you out
of my mind for a single heartbeat.

228
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,400
Darling, it's not too late.

229
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,600
You've been using your sex on me.
Why?

230
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:07,040
All right, you can take me home now.
No, I'm not going to be seen walking
with you, even among the dead.

231
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,880
You're a coward!

232
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:15,560
Sure I'm a coward, I also have
a wife who's with my dean. I'd
rather not lose my job or my wife.

233
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,600
Oh, Mark!

234
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,040
What did I ever do to you?

235
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:35,040
That's what you did to me, so now
I warn you, stay away from me.

236
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,160
That's the wrong way to tell me.

237
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,040
# Candles...

238
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,480
# Candles...

239
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,560
# Buy a candle...

240
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,760
# For your loved one

241
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:12,320
# Buy a candle for your loved one

242
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,440
# Place a candle at the... #

243
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,080
Barbara?

244
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:56,360
Where were you last night?
Please don't come into my room
without permission, Paul.

245
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,200
Get out of my room!

246
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,440
After the way you've behaved,

247
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,880
I don't think maidenly modesty
becomes you!

248
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,920
Maybe I'm wrong...

249
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,960
maybe it does become you!

250
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,080
Remind me to wake you
every morning...

251
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,000
..cousin dear(!)

252
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:32,960
Clay Duchaine is not a man
to be put off too long.
You're not to be a marriage broker.

253
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,080
If you and Barbara won't look
after this family, I will!

254
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,880
You wanted me, Aunt Eulah?
Close the door, Barbara.

255
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:47,200
You let me worry about you
wandering alone through the streets
at all hours of the night.

256
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,760
I wasn't wandering in the streets,
Aunt Eulah.

257
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,600
I was at the cemetery.
Who escorted you? I was alone.

258
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:02,120
Why alone? Because I didn't want
anyone to see me lighting a candle
at my grandmother's tomb.

259
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,240
How did you dare? Aunt Eulah,
I don't want to hurt you,

260
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,200
but the tomb looked so uncared for,
covered with weeds.

261
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,240
It looked so lonely.

262
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,920
Did anyone see you?
No-one who knew us.

263
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:21,280
You might have picked another lonely
grave and kept your promise to Clay.

264
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:26,640
You no longer need to make a rich
marriage for me. What do you mean?

265
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,720
The inheritance, that's what it is!

266
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,640
No, Barbara! I'm afraid so. You
dare to associate our name with...

267
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:45,400
Mr Toplady promised me that nobody
will know where the money came from.
How much is it? It doesn't matter.

268
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:53,160
Not even if it's a million dollars?
A million? Just about. You're not to
take it, Barbara. I HAVE taken it.

269
00:27:53,160 --> 00:28:00,320
Think what a difference it would
make  parties again, servants,
a new carriage and clothes for you.

270
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,640
And Paul may have that new pair
of shoes! Thank you, Cousin!

271
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,880
This is a matter of...
Don't worry, Mother!

272
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,320
Don't sign anything
without my advice.

273
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:18,480
People are so underhanded.
I wouldn't dream of doing anything
without you, Paul!

274
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,480
You came to this decision
very suddenly.

275
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,640
It couldn't have anything to do with
meeting the new bride at the boat?

276
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,680
Couldn't it, cousin dear?

277
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,520
This is it, Miss Barbie.
Are you sure? You listen to what
I tell you. Help Miss Barbie out.

278
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,880
PIANO PLAYS IN HOUSE

279
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:46,480
Why didn't you let him
help you out, Miss Barbie?
Money's gone to your head, Pappy!

280
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,280
PIANO PLAYING STOPS

281
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:01,920
I hope you'll forgive me for calling
unexpectedly. I'm Barbara Beaurevel.
I wouldn't have recognised you,

282
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,960
you look so pretty.

283
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,480
You play very well.
I do a lot of things very well.

284
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:14,520
Do you mind if I come in?
I'm giving a little party in honour
of my aunt's birthday next Friday.

285
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,560
I wonder if you'd come?

286
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,760
I wonder if I would, too,
although it's nice of you to ask.

287
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,480
My husband isn't home, you know.
Yes, I know.

288
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,960
You ARE the girl, aren't you? Yes.

289
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,000
That's very interesting...

290
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,040
The girl he left behind

291
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,080
and his new bride.

292
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,120
That IS what you came to talk about?

293
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,560
Not exactly. I came to see
what you're like.

294
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,760
What am I like? I suppose I came
to find out if you love him.

295
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,920
That's very impressive
"Do you love your husband?

296
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,320
"If you don't, may I have him back?"
Do you love your husband?

297
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,760
I'm crazy about him
and he's crazy about me,

298
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,800
and besides that,

299
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,120
he MARRIED me.

300
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,680
How did you know about me? A girl
would have to be pretty simple

301
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,120
not to know when a man
is on the rebound. I see.

302
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,000
And then that day at the boat.

303
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,560
I'd never let a man see that look
in my eyes... I imagine so.

304
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:30,240
Is this yours? ..or do you meet
all the boats like that? Not all.
Anything else bothering you?

305
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,760
I think you'd want a richer man.
College professors don't make
much money. Mark will.

306
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:43,800
I'll see that he gets over
this research business. Don't worry
about me. I'm worrying about Mark.

307
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:50,320
You needn't worry about Mark
as long as I have him, and
I've got him! The way you say that

308
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,560
it sounds somehow temporary.

309
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,760
It's for as short
or as long as I want it.

310
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,600
I think I understand, Mrs Lucas.

311
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,640
I'm so glad you do.

312
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,640
It was very nice of you to call.

313
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,600
Are you coming to my party?
Do you still want me?

314
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,720
You have a beautiful figure. I know.
You should show it off dancing.

315
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:20,200
Everybody who counts will be
there  all the most attractive men,
even some poor ones.

316
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,080
You know, I might just come.
I hope so. I'm sorry I was angry.

317
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,560
As a matter of a fact, I'm not.
Goodbye.

318
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,120
Goodbye.

319
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:41,480
Thanks for classifying me with them!
If you file your research, I'll
have no trouble classifying you.

320
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:48,000
You sound like Mrs Lucas.
The power of a woman is a force
you scientists sometimes overlook.

321
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,440
Sometimes to our regret! Good night.

322
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,040
Like it?

323
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,400
It's beautiful. What's it for?
We had a caller. She asked me
if I was in love with you. And?

324
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:10,440
I said I was crazy about you.
So she'd like us on exhibition. She
thinks she's cleverer than I am.

325
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,000
As long as she introduces me
to the right people, I don't care.

326
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,040
When we make a show for this town,
I'll decide the date.

327
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,480
MARK: I'd like to see
Miss Beaurevel.

328
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,920
Well, our famous doctor!
Won't you come in?

329
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,960
I want to see Barbara. She's dining
out this evening. You're sure?

330
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,120
Of course I'm sure. Thanks.

331
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,080
Is there something I can do?

332
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,640
Yes... It's about the invitation.
Invitation?

333
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:49,120
You're shocked? It's an intimate
party for my mother's birthday. I
didn't realise that Barbara would...

334
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,480
Invite a foreigner? That's
a ridiculous way of putting it.

335
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,400
You don't approve.
It's not a question of approving.

336
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:05,000
Before I went to South America
wasn't that a matter of disapproval?
I didn't want Barbara to marry you.

337
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,040
Now you don't want me in your house.
You're extremely abrupt,
aren't you, Doctor?

338
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:17,600
Even if it's not your house.
I'm sorry, apparently you don't
think very well of me. Sure I do.

339
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:24,400
You live a very pleasant life
for a man with little charm,
less talent and no honour!

340
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:35,160
When I was a boy, Mother used to say
when I had trouble with the street
children, "Paul, regard the source."

341
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:42,440
I'm following Mother's advice.
I came here to ask your cousin
to kindly eat her invitation,

342
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,480
now I think I'll use it.

343
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,600
I strongly urge you not to.

344
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,320
Good night!

345
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,840
ORCHESTRA PLAYS A WALTZ

346
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,600
PAPPY: Monsieur and Madame Coucher.

347
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,640
Mademoiselle Dupres
and Monsieur Latay.

348
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,600
Senator and Madame Dulonier.

349
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,360
So you're going into business, Paul.

350
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,200
I may handle Clay's affairs.
It's not necessary now.

351
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,240
Doctor and Madame Lucas.

352
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:32,080
I'm so pleased you could come,
Mrs Lucas. Good evening, Doctor.
It was dear of you to ask us.

353
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:39,000
We've met before. Under less
cordial circumstances. We're
honoured. This is my cousin Paul.

354
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,160
Delighted, Madame.

355
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:50,760
I'm sure you don't mind if I ask
your wife to dance with me? Whatever
the rules are, I'll play them.

356
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,160
May I have the honour?

357
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,200
It will be a pleasure.

358
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,520
I don't believe you've met my aunt.

359
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:10,280
Aunt Eulah, I'd like you to meet...
You must be a Delgar, the nose is
unmistakable. This is Dr Lucas.

360
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,760
Aren't you related to the Delgars?
No, I always regretted it.

361
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,880
You're not a native at all.

362
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,600
Not of New Orleans - do you mind?
< Of course not.

363
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,720
Would you take over the reception
for me? Dr Lucas has asked me
to dance. Certainly.

364
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,760
MARK: Many happy returns.

365
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,680
Thank you, young man.

366
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:44,800
They're getting on very well,
aren't they? That makes it all
very companionable, doesn't it?

367
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,600
You know, you're very beautiful
tonight, Dr Lucas.

368
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,640
It's just my new suit.

369
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:04,680
Aren't you going to say anything
about me? You're very beautiful
tonight. You're a fool, Mark.

370
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:11,120
Thank you for a very pleasant dance.
You can't leave me on the floor,
it's not polite.

371
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,800
I'm a Yankee  no manners.
I'll scream. Go ahead!

372
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,360
It's just the way it used to be.
Nothing's changed between us.

373
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:41,280
Well, there's one minor item, I
have a wife. But you don't love her.

374
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,960
I married her. Why? She's pretty.
You once said you loved me.

375
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,080
Sure  I was crazy about you.
I thought you were about me.

376
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:56,520
There was just the two of us
nobody else. I thought
it would be like that for ever.

377
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:04,040
It should have been. Your
delightful cousin let me know just
before I sailed for South America.

378
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:10,720
He told me that he'd protect you.
He wouldn't let your aunt
know that you'd been out with me.

379
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,800
I began to look at it...
began to wonder... The secrecy,

380
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,840
never meeting your friends. I told
you why. You said you understood.

381
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:27,600
I only understood that it had to be
everything and nothing. That's why
I asked you to marry me on the boat.

382
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,880
And I wanted to.

383
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,920
But you didn't meet me.

384
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,320
I suppose you just forgot.

385
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,080
I told you why I couldn't
in the letter. What letter?

386
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:46,640
The one you got when you sailed. I
told you that we'd be married when
you got back. There was no letter.

387
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,080
It was Paul.

388
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,120
Now it's Paul who didn't write the
letter? He didn't let it get to you.

389
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:00,640
Mark, I DID write to you.
All right, suppose I believe you?

390
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,360
Then it's all right. You mean you,
Corinne and I can live together?

391
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:09,960
She doesn't mean anything to you.
She's my wife. Get a divorce.

392
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,520
What kind of people are we?
We know what kind she is. Why worry?

393
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:19,720
YOU wouldn't. She'd leave you for
the first rich man she could find!

394
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:26,600
You read people just like books,
don't you? Please don't spoil
our only chance of happiness.

395
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,200
Happiness doesn't grow like that.

396
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,560
There's no use trying to explain
anything to you like an adult

397
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,160
so let's forget it,
let's leave it alone.

398
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,000
Mark...

399
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,200
Kiss me once before you go.

400
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,200
Where have you been, darling?
I wanted to dance with you.

401
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,040
PAPPY SINGS A LULLABY

402
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,080
PAPPY CONTINUES TO SING

403
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,240
You sent for me,
my beautiful cousin?

404
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,400
Tell me about the letter, Paul.

405
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,360
You realise, of course,
that I did it for your own good.

406
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,200
You're always doing things
for other people, aren't you, Paul?

407
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:11,360
Certainly. Now you can marry
anybody you please,
and I don't have to marry at all!

408
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,200
You intend to continue living on MY
money? It's all in the family, isn't
it? Yes, Carrie Crandall's family.

409
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,440
Vulgar language doesn't become you,
Cousin.

410
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,440
What's the matter, Barbara?

411
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,520
You can't still be in love with
that germ detective! I loathe him.

412
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:43,440
Well, that's excellent. Just between
cousins, I happen to find his wife
vaguely attractive. How vaguely?

413
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,480
Not too vaguely.

414
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,440
You seemed fairly successful
with her tonight.

415
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,760
That was accomplished
by schoolboy lesson number one.

416
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,080
She seemed quite willing. Yes.

417
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:03,840
But you didn't send for me
to discuss the lush Corinne's
morals...or did you? Paul...

418
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:10,520
Are you still trying to get
50,000 dollars to start a brokerage
business? I don't need it now.

419
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:15,400
You're getting no more of my money.
Barbara, don't be ridiculous!

420
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,840
Although you might get the money
if... If what?

421
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,200
I want you to make Mrs Lucas
fall in love with you.

422
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,480
When do I get the money?

423
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,520
25,000 dollars tomorrow,

424
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:46,600
the rest the day
she meets you in an...
Assignation is the word. Yes.

425
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:51,960
That scientist fellow must have torn
your pride to shreds this evening.

426
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:59,000
You know, Barbara, we're only
cousins and yet we're so very much
alike, but you're beautiful.

427
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,560
You're being paid to use your charm
on Mrs Lucas.

428
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,880
Fire and blood, they always go
together. Let me see his age.
Four years old. In his prime, sir.

429
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,920
Five years. How high does he stand?

430
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,480
15 hands. 14 three, I'd say.

431
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,320
He's Arabian. Could carry a giant.
He's light-boned. He wouldn't
carry my wife.

432
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,600
If it's size you want... Leave him
for trial, take the rest away.

433
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,440
Hello, Cousin,
do you think a certain young matron

434
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,480
will be properly entranced
by the sight of a Beaurevel
on a spirited Arab?

435
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,960
A preliminary rendezvous
has been arranged.

436
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:15,400
I'm not interested in details.
In that case, perhaps
I should drop the whole matter.

437
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,560
Is that what you want? No.

438
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:23,680
Then there are certain
other expenses to be met.
I found a delightful old boathouse

439
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,600
on the Bayou St Jean.

440
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:34,160
You may have even used it yourself.
It will take a certain amount of
money to make it properly enticing.

441
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:41,680
You already have 25,000 dollars.
I won't touch that. I'm treating it
as a sentimental trust. Paul...

442
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,040
perhaps we HAD better drop...
AUNT EULAH: Barbara! >

443
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,080
Wish me well, Cousin.

444
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:22,680
I was afraid you wouldn't come.
I was afraid YOU wouldn't. My dear
lady, there's far too much at stake.

445
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,240
The most beautiful women
in New Orleans were at our party,
you outshone them all.

446
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:36,280
What's the matter? That was
my first party and my last. Good,
then I'll have you all to myself!

447
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,920
I don't think you understand.
I'm not going to see you any more.

448
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,160
You've heard gossip about me.

449
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:50,280
Whatever you've heard happened
long before I met you. It has
nothing to do with you. What gossip?

450
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:56,720
Never mind. What are you trying
to say? Meeting you at the ball
was so important to me.

451
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:01,240
I know it's not your problem,
it's mine. And mine alone...

452
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,920
And I'm not unaware of your charm.

453
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,960
The Beaurevel luck.

454
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,480
You also know I'm a married woman.

455
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:15,000
The Beaurevel luck! Exactly, you're
a Beaurevel with money, position...

456
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,120
I dare not see you again.

457
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,640
Have you considered MY feelings?

458
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,160
I want to stop it
before there are any feelings.

459
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,600
I see. Oh, how charming!

460
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,840
Corinne, you're right,
we won't see one another again.

461
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,360
Oh, no!

462
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:42,160
Well, what I mean is,
maybe we shouldn't be too hasty.

463
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,440
Maybe it won't be as difficult
as I thought. No, it won't be
difficult at all.

464
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:59,960
Every year, our budget becomes
larger. Because every year there
are more students, more teachers.

465
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:06,400
I suppose progress is costly.
By the way, how's Lucas making out?
Fine  a good man.

466
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,040
I'm delighted to hear that. I was
a little worried. About what?

467
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:17,640
It's nothing of any consequence.
Lucas's background is perhaps
not the most desirable,

468
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,720
but it's of no consequence.

469
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:27,280
What about Dr Lucas's background?
It's ridiculously inadequate for the
importance of the position he holds.

470
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:34,320
He worked as a common labourer
on the docks one time. Yes, so he
could study medicine at night.

471
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,840
I'm glad to see you so vigorously
defend one of your faculty,

472
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:45,280
however Lucas's contract
is up soon and you might want
to find someone more suitable.

473
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:52,960
But Dr Lucas has a brilliant future.
Some day you'll be proud we had him
on our Faculty. I hope you're right.

474
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:09,320
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
Close the door quietly, please,

475
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,560
I don't want any little gusts
of air.

476
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,880
You made me miss!

477
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,320
I'm extremely sorry. Not at all.

478
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,480
A mathematical experiment?

479
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,520
No, it's a gambling game.

480
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,640
I paid my way through college
with it. Sit down, please.

481
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:34,680
But that's your chair.
It's my only chair but you're
trustee of the university.

482
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,560
I happen to have a friend...
You're a lucky man.

483
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,600
This friend has noticed

484
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:48,000
that Miss Beaurevel seems to take
rather a dangerous interest in you,
if I may be blunt. Oh, do be blunt.

485
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,320
Well, there you are.

486
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,080
Where?

487
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,280
A Creole would understand.
I come from upstate New York.

488
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,960
Coffee, Mr Duchaine? No, thank you.

489
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:06,080
I'm in a position to secure for you
a full professorship at any
of several Northern universities.

490
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,640
May we be blunt again, Mr Duchaine?
By all means.

491
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:14,920
You're bribing me to relieve Miss
Beaurevel of my dangerous presence.

492
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:21,400
I'd much rather you didn't put it
that way. I know. We Northerners
are so crass.

493
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,440
So how much would you pay me
in addition to the job?

494
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,880
You leave me at a loss, Lucas.

495
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,920
I come from a very old
and honourable family in New York

496
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,960
and my honour is necessarily
expensive. Would, er...

497
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:40,640
5,000 dollars be too much
for your mythical friend?

498
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,240
5,000 dollars is a lot of money.

499
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:49,120
Let's be business-like, Mr Duchaine.
5,000, yes or no? Very well.

500
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:56,400
I'll arrange for you to leave this
university at once. Do they still
have duels in New Orleans? Why?

501
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:04,200
When you realise what a fool you've
been, you may want to challenge me.
You've been laughing at me.

502
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:09,200
Forgive me, there's so little
to laugh at around here, unless you
want to join me in a game of chance.

503
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,120
Gently with the door, please,
it deflects the cards.

504
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:32,160
Hello, Cousin. Get out of my room!
Happily, as soon as you've given
me a cheque for 25,000 dollars.

505
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,720
I gave it to you. You promised me
a similar amount

506
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:39,920
when a certain transaction
was concluded. And you have?

507
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,480
The esteemed Dr Lucas will not be
dining at home this evening.

508
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,760
He will be working in his laboratory
through the night. How elevating!

509
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:56,160
Don't be charming, Paul.
I can't help it. Even when
you slapped me, I was charming.

510
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,200
What do women see in you?
You nauseate me!

511
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:06,800
Corinne will meet me at 9:30 and
may I say that she would have come
sooner if she could have got away.

512
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,400
All right, Paul. And the cheque?

513
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,720
Tomorrow.

514
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,640
Amazing, isn't it? I trust you.

515
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,480
We're both nauseating people,
aren't we, Cousin?

516
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,720
I must get a lock for that door.

517
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,160
That's the wrong door to lock.

518
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:48,160
Look, I'm busy. Say whatever you
came to say and then leave me alone.

519
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,280
This probably won't interest you
but... Probably not.

520
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,920
I remember your telling me
how cheap I was... Yeah, I remember.

521
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,360
That's why you ought to lock
your door at home.

522
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,360
I think you'd better be
very careful of what you say next.

523
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,680
I will be
only the exact truth.

524
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:14,520
While you're here saving humanity,
your wife is out with another man,
being human.

525
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:20,760
Your stories are
like anonymous letters. People
pay very little attention to them.

526
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:26,520
Do you remember a certain boathouse
on the bayou? Vaguely. That's where.

527
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,560
Now may I get back to work?

528
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,600
Of course you may...

529
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,640
if you can!

530
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,480
Hell hath no fury...

531
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,680
MARK'S WORDS ECHO
'Happiness doesn't grow like that.

532
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:10,320
'There's no use trying to explain

so let's forget it.'

535

PAUL: 'We're both nauseating people,
aren't we?'

536
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,640
May I have some more wine?

537
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,080
Do you need some more?

538
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,640
Paul, don't. Why not? You came
to meet me in a deserted boathouse.

539
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,440
No!

540
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:16,920
I don't like cheap affairs.
Neither do I. Darling, you're
just what I've always looked for.

541
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:22,360
I'd want to marry you even if you
weren't a Beaurevel and were poor.

542
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:28,680
That's sweet but I never discuss
marriage with married women.
I could get a divorce. For me?

543
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:36,440
Yes, darling. I'm constitutionally
opposed to marriage. I don't see
why that should spoil our evening.

544
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:41,560
But I do. No, you don't. No! I told
you I don't like cheap affairs.

545
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:47,440
I see how Lucas got caught.
He was the first step up the ladder
for you. Paul!

546
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,000
I don't intend...

547
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,560
I'm sorry, Corinne.
I didn't mean to...

548
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,080
Corinne.

549
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,400
Corinne!

550
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,360
Mark.

551
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,920
Go on home.

552
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,800
Go on home and stay out of this!

553
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,800
< DOOR CLOSES

554
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:23,000
Hello, Barbara. I suppose
you're annoyed with me.

555
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:29,720
I had a change of heart
and failed to keep the appointment
at the boathouse. I was there, Paul.

556
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,680
I saw you run away.

557
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,960
It was an accident. You killed her.
I told you it was an accident!

558
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:45,720
I had no intention of even
hurting her. Mark found the body.
Did he see me? What did he say?

559
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,760
He told me to go home.

560
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,800
To stay out of it.

561
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,320
Yes...

562
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,360
Very proper.

563
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,800
He'll protect your fair name.

564
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:04,840
Association with the better
families of New Orleans has taught
him the manners of a gentleman.

565
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,240
They'll think he did it.
Yes, they will.

566
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,680
In any event, he'll find himself

567
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:15,040
in a rather unpleasant situation.
What are you going to do?

568
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,440
Me?!

569
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:22,840
Remember that you're
equally involved, and perhaps
in a more distasteful fashion.

570
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,920
Are you going to the police?

571
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,480
Why, of course not!
If I'd admitted to this affair

572
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,760
there wouldn't be a decent house
in New Orleans open to us.

573
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:36,160
And I don't think
you're going to the police.

574
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:41,400
You don't want the newspapers
to know about your unholy ancestry!

575
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,800
They'd realise that you come
by your depravity quite honestly!

576
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:55,920
We spent the evening at home. You
were playing the piano  I heard
you. And I was reading  you saw me.

577
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,600
A very good book, too!

578
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:09,080
Barbara dear, no-one is worth
so much worry.

579
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:14,160
Look at our acquaintances and our
friends  revolting, aren't they?

580
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:18,680
This research fellow
isn't even one of our circle.

581
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,280
Barbara, forget them, all of them.

582
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,360
Let's consider ourselves.

583
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:27,560
You once said we were
nauseating people. You were right.

584
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,680
Of course!

585
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,720
Good night, Cousin.

586
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,800
But if Lucas did it, why did
he call the police? Don't be naive.

587
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:51,120
He wanted to avoid suspicion.
He killed his wife...
I refuse to believe he's guilty.

588
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:56,760
Even you must believe that this
has somewhat vitiated his merit.

589
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:00,040
I rescind Dr Lucas's contract.

590
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:07,480
See that he leaves at once. Surely
you realise the injustice of this?
My fellow trustees agree with me.

591
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,840
Gentlemen?

592
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,080
Good day, Dean. Good day, sir.

593
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,120
I'm sorry, Dean.

594
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,160
Good day, sir.

595
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,760
KNOCK AT DOOR

596
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,800
Come in.

597
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,880
Come right in.

598
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,920
Wouldn't you like one
of my little pets as a keepsake?

599
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,960
The inquest is tomorrow.

600
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,080
I know.

601
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:45,440
I've been setting MY house in order,
how about yours?

602
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:50,400
It was an accident, but
it's my fault  Paul's  not yours.

603
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,920
I've read enough Sherlock Holmes

604
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:59,600
to be able to figure that out
by myself(!) All right, I've ruined
your life and your career,

605
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,840
tell me what to do.
What else is there to do?

606
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:07,120
You've made a clean breast of it,
your conscience is clear.

607
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:13,640
Mark! Isn't that really
why you came to me? Do you
really not know what to do?

608
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:18,280
Isn't there an absolute refusal
on your part to face yourself?

609
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:24,240
You never will,
that's why our back-door affair
was held in such strict privacy.

610
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,280
From the beginning

611
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:32,880
you were afraid of what
your charming aristocracy might
think of it. Maybe you're right.

612
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:37,320
Now you'll have all the time
in the world to think about it.

613
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:41,920
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to say goodbye
to the rest of my little friends.

614
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,680
CORONER: Have the doors closed.

615
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:10,880
MAN: The inquest is in session.
The doors will be closed.

616
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,920
This is an inquisition
into the death of Corinne Lucas.

617
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:21,440
It is the responsibility
of the jurors to judge
from the evidence introduced

618
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,000
whether the death was from
natural causes, from an accident,

619
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,440
or as the result of homicide.

620
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:34,960
It is not the jurors' duty
to judge any of the witnesses
either guilty or not guilty,

621
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,680
but it is within the jurors' duties

622
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:44,560
to advise me to deliver the body
of any person whom they think
is responsible for such homicide.

623
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,000
Call the first witness, please.

624
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:53,240
Who else was in the boathouse
when you got there?
This gentleman here. Dr Lucas.

625
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,760
What was the attitude of Dr Lucas?

626
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,520
I can't seem to think
there was any attitude.

627
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:03,200
Was the room in any disorder?

628
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,720
Well, yes, sir.

629
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:14,240
Did it appear that there may have
been a struggle? I was certain.
Thank you, Sergeant.

630
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,280
Next witness, please.

631
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:21,840
Doctor, the deceased was found
partly in the fireplace.

632
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:26,160
Would a fall against an andiron have
caused her death? I should say so.

633
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:32,120
Was the fall a natural one?
Even an attack of vertigo
would not cause such a fall.

634
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:40,000
I don't know why in the world
you came here, Barbara.
Why did you, Barbara?

635
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,560
Barbara's interested in
these sordid spectacles and so am I.

636
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:48,680
Thank you, Doctor, that is all.
Next witness, please.

637
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:55,880
Where did you go when you left the
university? To the old boathouse
on the lake. And what did you find?

638
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,920
My wife was dead.

639
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,160
You say she died before you arrived.
That's what I say.

640
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:09,480
What made you go to the
old boathouse? You had important
research scheduled for that night.

641
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,000
I had a premonition.
What kind of premonition?

642
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,520
I'm afraid it's beyond explanation.

643
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:20,920
Just a premonition?
No-one gave you information?

644
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:27,720
No-one. What did you expect
to find when you reached
the boathouse? I don't know.

645
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:35,160
You had no idea that your wife might
be there with another man? Look,
this is an inquest, not a trial.

646
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:41,800
You're supposed to find out facts,
not motives. You wouldn't
understand my motives.

647
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:45,240
Back to your arrival
at the boathouse

648
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:49,440
you say it was empty except
for the body of your wife. Yes.

649
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,800
So there is no witness
for or against you? If there were,

650
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:58,120
do you think he or she
would refuse to come forward?

651
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,560
Careful, Barbara,
it's showing in your face.

652
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:07,400
Dr Lucas, your manner is so evasive
and your facts so uncertain,

653
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,440
that I feel that you are
withholding the truth from us!

654
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:18,120
May I remind you that you are
in a situation of great jeopardy.
I don't need to be reminded.

655
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:22,840
Then you have nothing further
to tell this investigating body?

656
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,880
Nothing further.

657
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:32,240
Even though you will be taken
into custody for indictment before
a grand jury? Nothing further.

658
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:39,280
Wait! Have you any evidence?
Mr Coroner... Yes, Mr Beaurevel.
My cousin is overwrought.

659
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:46,320
May she be excused? The jurors will
disregard this outburst. The good
name of the Beaurevels will...

660
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,360
The good name?

661
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:52,720
Carrie Crandall's name?
I'm the granddaughter
of the notorious Carrie Crandall!

662
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:02,520
Let this witness stick
to pertinent facts. Dr Lucas's wife
was dead before he got there.

663
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:08,960
My cousin Paul was with her.
I bribed him to meet her
with Carrie Crandall's money.

664
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,760
I tried to stop it but I failed.
I was there outside when she fell,

665
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:17,040
and I saw him run away
before Dr Lucas got there. These
are the facts and I swear to them.

666
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:26,520
This inquest is recessed
until ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

667
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:30,400
Spectators, please leave.
The jurors are dismissed.

668
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,440
Blood will tell,

669
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,960
my angelic cousin.

670
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,560
You're coming with me, Beaurevel.

671
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:41,240
Not MR Beaurevel?
You're coming along with me!

672
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:52,160
Barbara... Oh, Aunt Eulah!

673
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:58,600
If only I could have spared
you this. I warned you
not to take that money.

674
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:04,640
I hope all your days
will be as empty and bitter
as you have made mine.

675
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:09,880
Stay away from me and stay away
from my house. You and
your grandmother are two of a kind!

676
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,840
Oh, Mark, take me away!

677
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:17,200
Anywhere,
wherever it is I can hide.

678
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,240
You can't hide,

679
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,400
and you can't leave here yet.

680
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,000
I can't bear to face anybody again.

681
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,040
Please!

682
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:29,520
There are a few things
that you'll have to face.

683
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:34,160
You'll be at the inquest
when it reopens. You'll have
to face the people.

684
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,840
You'll have to face yourself
finally.

685
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,280
You know it just could be...

686
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,720
that if you do all those things,

687
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:47,160
you might turn out to be
quite a woman.
