1
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:42,404
In ancient times, the world was
ruled by gods and monsters.

2
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,436
But it was the half-god Perseus,
my son...

3
00:00:47,436 --> 00:00:51,311
...who defeated the Kraken
and saved humanity.

4
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:57,251
For his courage, I offered him
a place to rule at my side.

5
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,749
But Perseus...

6
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:03,692
...was strong-willed
and chose a different path.

7
00:01:03,692 --> 00:01:07,026
He vowed to live as a man.

8
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:11,066
Even when fate took his wife...

9
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:13,899
...he would not pray for help, from me...

10
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,099
...or the other gods.

11
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,702
And now the time of the gods is ending.

12
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:25,145
But the son of Zeus cannot hide
from his destiny forever.

13
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,888
Now pull it in. Do it again.

14
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,991
Throw in the other one real quick.
Go on. I will tie this off.

15
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,561
Good catch today, Dad.

16
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:46,268
- Where'd you get that?
- I made it myself.

17
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,934
You made it yourself? Heh.

18
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,673
I want to be a good god
and do good things.

19
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,816
- There's no such thing as good gods.
- Some of them are good.

20
00:01:57,816 --> 00:02:01,511
Ah. Helius, there's more to life
than gods and Titans.

21
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,617
Hey, Clea. I have a confession to make.

22
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:08,287
I, uh, needed him for chores
so he skipped studying.

23
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:13,260
Now, you do a good job, make me proud.

24
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,181
I know you're here.

25
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,160
I visit him sometimes in his dreams.

26
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,928
He's like his father.
A strong-willed boy.

27
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:53,499
You just passing through?

28
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,807
No.

29
00:02:58,978 --> 00:02:59,842
I need your help...

30
00:02:59,842 --> 00:03:01,071
...Perseus.

31
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:04,374
You're the great god Zeus.
You don't need my help.

32
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,515
There is a calamity coming.

33
00:03:07,515 --> 00:03:10,679
It will affect us all. Gods and men.

34
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:14,392
The humans may have stopped praying
to us... With good reason.

35
00:03:14,392 --> 00:03:16,085
...but there are consequences.

36
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,495
Without prayer, we gods lose our power.

37
00:03:19,495 --> 00:03:24,365
When our power leaves us,
all our work comes undone. All of it.

38
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,746
The walls of Tartarus are falling.

39
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:41,745
It is emptying all its demons onto the
earth. The first are already here.

40
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:47,183
If our power diminishes much further,
we gods will become mortal.

41
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:49,920
We will die and Kronos himself will escape.

42
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,131
It will mean chaos. The end of the world.

43
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,229
What am I meant to do?

44
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,399
This is business for gods.

45
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,573
We need all our children now.

46
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,099
Perhaps, together...

47
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,744
...we can remedy this.

48
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:08,642
But we need every shred of power, Perseus.

49
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,609
I will never leave my son.

50
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,619
I know your heart better
than you know it yourself.

51
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,328
You believe your human half
makes you unworthy to join us.

52
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,063
You will learn someday that...

53
00:04:26,063 --> 00:04:27,756
...being half-human...

54
00:04:27,756 --> 00:04:31,131
...makes you stronger than a god,
not weaker.

55
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,167
I think you should go.

56
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,240
Sleep well, Perseus.

57
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,454
I will never leave my son.

58
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,782
Zeus.

59
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,267
Poseidon.

60
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,429
Brother.

61
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,263
It has been an age.

62
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,304
Indeed, it has.

63
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,477
Ares.

64
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,682
My son.

65
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,216
Where's my brother Perseus?

66
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,287
Gone fishing?

67
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,690
Yes.

68
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,691
What a brave and noble decision.

69
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:17,634
Let us go, then.

70
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,221
Tartarus.
The great prison of the underworld.

71
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,418
Brother Hades.

72
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,588
We have come to your domain...

73
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,755
...as agreed.

74
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,757
Show yourself to us.

75
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,542
After so many years...

76
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:04,807
...the sons of Kronos, together once more.

77
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,678
Brothers in arms.

78
00:08:06,678 --> 00:08:08,286
Hades...

79
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:12,684
...you are the great
ruler of the underworld.

80
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,490
Allow us to enter and help you rebuild...

81
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,890
...the walls of Tartarus.

82
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:22,393
My beloved brother,
who banished me here for eternity...

83
00:08:22,393 --> 00:08:25,833
...to look after our father, now seeks...

84
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,632
...reconciliation.

85
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,969
We must forget the past, brother...

86
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,372
...and unite.

87
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,507
Yes.

88
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,548
But on my terms.

89
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,586
Poseidon.

90
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:58,734
Above you.

91
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,003
Poseidon.

92
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,692
It has begun.

93
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,867
Helius?

94
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:13,736
Helius.

95
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
Stay away, stay away.

96
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,151
Helius?

97
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,585
Helius.

98
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:57,548
Chimera.

99
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,691
Helius.

100
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,124
Have you seen Helius?

101
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:14,932
Helius.

102
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:17,504
Get back.

103
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,739
Keep away. Its venom catches fire.

104
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,482
Stay down.

105
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,604
Helius, go with them.

106
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,282
Take him.

107
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,680
I will find you. Go.

108
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,423
Go.

109
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,023
- Dad.
- Run.

110
00:12:16,023 --> 00:12:16,861
Go.

111
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,231
Helius.

112
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:24,634
Helius.

113
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,812
- Dad, hurry.
- I am coming, son.

114
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,810
Helius. Stay there.

115
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,250
Dad.

116
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:51,330
Helius.

117
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:53,467
Here.

118
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,066
Come and get me.

119
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,513
What are you waiting for? Burn me.

120
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,667
Sit.

121
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:43,776
Ohh.

122
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:46,942
Things are happening...

123
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,882
...in the world, Perseus.
You know that, you have instincts.

124
00:14:49,882 --> 00:14:52,046
The son of a god.

125
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,352
A son needs a father.

126
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,089
I made a vow to lo.

127
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:02,360
I know, I know,
I was there delivering your son.

128
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,264
You vowed to your wife
you'd never let Helius wield a sword.

129
00:15:05,264 --> 00:15:07,598
That you'd live with him
as a simple fisherman.

130
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,738
Well, that's a fine game in normal times.

131
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:16,181
But if you have power,
you also have a duty.

132
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,413
Just fix my body...

133
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,750
...and leave my soul to me.

134
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,583
Where are we going?

135
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,191
I need to speak to my father.

136
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,331
There's nothing to be frightened of.

137
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,473
This is the Mount of Idols.

138
00:15:43,473 --> 00:15:45,769
The closest place to the heavens.

139
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,213
It's a place where people come
to worship the gods.

140
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:53,951
Or at least they used to come.

141
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,588
Zeus?

142
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,524
Father.

143
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,852
Poseidon.

144
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,148
What happened?

145
00:16:32,148 --> 00:16:34,986
Hades and Ares have joined Kronos...

146
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,852
...against humanity.

147
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,022
All the gods have disappeared.

148
00:16:40,022 --> 00:16:43,293
- I fear the worst.
- Here, here.

149
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,169
I got you, I got you.

150
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,067
Where's my father?

151
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,470
Captured.

152
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:56,175
You must journey to the underworld
and free him.

153
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,206
They took my father.

154
00:16:58,206 --> 00:17:00,477
You're the only hope left in this world.

155
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,820
Or there will be oblivion.

156
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,886
How do I do it?

157
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,928
I am only half a god.

158
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,156
Then you must find another half-god.

159
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,666
Agenor.

160
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,829
He's my son.

161
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,541
He's with Queen Andromeda.

162
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,742
Tell him to take you to the Fallen One.

163
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,716
Poseidon.

164
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,817
Take this. Use it.

165
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,453
If my son...

166
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:46,223
...survives and proves worthy...

167
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,459
...give it to him.

168
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,633
My own son betrays me.

169
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,969
Only when it suits you,
you remember I am your son.

170
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,474
Hades.

171
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,012
You're sweating like a human, brother.
Next, it will be tears.

172
00:18:37,012 --> 00:18:38,877
Don't waste words on him.

173
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,978
Kronos is waiting...

174
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,481
...Father.

175
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,151
What?

176
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:48,623
Our father has offered us a deal.

177
00:18:48,623 --> 00:18:50,455
You fool.

178
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,660
If we help him to escape Tartarus...

179
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:58,132
...he will allow we few gods who remain
to keep our immortality.

180
00:18:58,132 --> 00:19:00,533
- No.
- Let him speak.

181
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,500
Let him speak.

182
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,304
Are you becoming weak?

183
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:10,013
You're in the underworld, Ares,
where it's wise to obey me.

184
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,279
You forget our father
once tried to kill us.

185
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,682
No, I remember everything.

186
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:23,355
And what exactly does our father want from
us in return for our precious immortality?

187
00:19:23,355 --> 00:19:28,796
We simply offer him the last of your
divine powers so that he may free himself.

188
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:32,960
Oh, Hades.

189
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,965
What have I done to you?

190
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,010
You laugh as if you had a choice.

191
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,985
There is no choice.

192
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,092
I hope you have enough of them.

193
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:58,493
Pull him.

194
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,417
You will need it more than me.

195
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,785
Pegasus.

196
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,693
Go on.

197
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,003
He likes you.

198
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,417
Me, on the other hand....

199
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,217
I love you.

200
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:03,890
I know.

201
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,158
Come on.

202
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:16,597
Eh, whoa.
Keep it straight. Have it look good.

203
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,095
Come on, boy.

204
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,472
More Chimera. Archers.

205
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,974
Go, go, go.

206
00:21:55,974 --> 00:21:58,480
Ready. Fire.

207
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,314
- Chimera.
- Ready.

208
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,115
Hold your lines. Hold your lines.

209
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,018
Out of the way.

210
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,327
Hold your fire.

211
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,594
- I said hold your fire.
- Queen Andromeda.

212
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,802
Ah, keep it straight. Oy.

213
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,038
Whoa.

214
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,146
You used to be a lot better at this.

215
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:41,422
All hail Perseus, killer of the Kraken.

216
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,560
Hail Perseus.

217
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,358
Great Perseus.

218
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,737
If it is action you're after,
you are a little late.

219
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,572
I am just here to see Queen Andromeda.

220
00:22:57,572 --> 00:23:00,041
This is a battlefield.

221
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,543
- I am in command here.
- Uh-huh.

222
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,045
Well, I wish to speak to the queen.

223
00:23:05,045 --> 00:23:07,549
And the queen wishes to speak to you.

224
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,782
Your Majesty.

225
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,155
Come on.

226
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,161
Hail Perseus.

227
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:31,040
You have obviously been
in your own battles, Perseus.

228
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,939
I have been busy with mine.

229
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:35,802
Yeah, you have.

230
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,978
I won't keep you.

231
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,052
It's been too long.

232
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,960
- I have a son now.
- I know. I'd like to meet him.

233
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,392
And my wife, she... I know.

234
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:00,636
I am sorry.

235
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,606
Your Majesty.

236
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,146
For the sake of the men, we must
resolve our differences before sunset.

237
00:24:10,146 --> 00:24:12,146
I made it clear we continue to fight...

238
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:13,841
...the Chimera invaders.

239
00:24:13,841 --> 00:24:16,453
Today in the field we lost 300 men...

240
00:24:16,453 --> 00:24:19,283
...for the death of four Chimera.
We have...

241
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:22,825
...offended the gods. We need to pray.

242
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:24,586
You'd pray to Ares, perhaps?

243
00:24:24,586 --> 00:24:26,958
As soldiers always have.

244
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,926
What if I was to tell you that Ares
is your enemy now?

245
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,534
I would make peace with him.

246
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,831
You would make peace with the god of war?

247
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:36,301
Perseus.

248
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,139
What's your strategy?

249
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:44,141
There's a way we can end this,
and then I can get home.

250
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,209
What is this for?
It's to cut the oars for my trireme.

251
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:48,477
I need 170 oars...

252
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:50,113
...for the three rows...

253
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:50,947
...one oar per man.

254
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,120
This looks like a pick.

255
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,691
lt is, however, the rudder
for my flagship. Quiet.

256
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,155
Morning checks, Your Majesty.

257
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,528
Always eventful.

258
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,791
Oh, Your Majesty.
Ah. So good to see you.

259
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:07,769
This is Agenor. He's a liar and a thief.
I know it didn't work out between us...

260
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,237
...but, please, do try and get over it.

261
00:25:10,237 --> 00:25:12,842
Have you ever had a woman
love you so much...

262
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,041
...she locks you up like a pet rabbit?

263
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:16,976
He wanted my hand in marriage.

264
00:25:16,976 --> 00:25:20,083
When I refused, he tried to run away
with the crown jewels.

265
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,344
I think it's my extraordinary eyes.

266
00:25:22,344 --> 00:25:24,921
Actually, you got the eyes of your father.

267
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,187
Do you know his father?

268
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,485
Yeah, Agenor here...

269
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,865
...he's the son of the great god Poseidon.

270
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:39,861
Your new boyfriend is clearly insane.

271
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,105
I am your cousin, Agenor.

272
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,034
I am the son of Zeus.

273
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,345
Half-god and abandoned just like you.

274
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:50,906
If my father sent you...

275
00:25:50,906 --> 00:25:53,050
...I want nothing to do with you.

276
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,716
Your father is dead.

277
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,412
Gods don't die.

278
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,221
They do now.

279
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,390
Good. Could you do me a favor?

280
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,620
Anything.
Go to hell.

281
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:07,860
That's exactly where I am going.

282
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,961
I just need information.

283
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,470
Your father told me...

284
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,870
...that you could help me
get to the Fallen One.

285
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,214
You long for the ocean, don't you?

286
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,782
It's like a thirst you cannot quench.

287
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,155
It must be hell for you in here.

288
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:45,159
I want a royal pardon.

289
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:48,962
Granted.

290
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,742
I want my body weight in gold.

291
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,136
Granted.

292
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,505
Few gold coins, you're so scrawny.

293
00:26:57,505 --> 00:27:00,845
Let me see. What else have I dreamt
of as I lay here in my cell?

294
00:27:00,845 --> 00:27:02,384
Don't push it.

295
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,590
I am going to need a boat,
your fastest boat.

296
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,022
The Fallen One lives far
across the ocean.

297
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,689
Where?

298
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,625
Well, put me on the deck of the boat
and I will show you.

299
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,332
Your ship awaits.

300
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,173
Fetch my lucky cape.

301
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,981
Do you know why
this is my lucky cape, me old mate?

302
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:34,140
Because the first time I wore it,
I sprouted a beard. A full-grown beard.

303
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,980
Send word to every regiment...

304
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,214
...that's still intact to gather here
at the Tyrene pass.

305
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,960
If I am not there in two days...

306
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:45,052
...then you can pray.

307
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,431
Your Majesty.

308
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,060
- Regroup at the garrison.
- You can't leave...

309
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,136
...Greece without a queen.

310
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,439
Are you giving me orders now?

311
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,388
Unchain him.

312
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,356
Show me where the Fallen One is.

313
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,364
Who is the Fallen One?

314
00:28:24,364 --> 00:28:27,733
Oh, the god Hephaestus.
Heh, heh.

315
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,603
And who's Hephaestus?

316
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,412
Hephaestus was the god
that made Poseidon's trident...

317
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,716
...Hades' pitchfork...

318
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:40,282
...and Zeus' thunderbolt.

319
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,412
Put those together...

320
00:28:42,412 --> 00:28:45,886
...they form the Spear of Trium,
the weapon the gods used...

321
00:28:45,886 --> 00:28:47,524
...to defeat Kronos.

322
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,991
But Hephaestus lives on the island
of Kail. Ha-ha-ha.

323
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,396
Which no one has ever found.

324
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:55,564
Kail doesn't exist, does it, Agenor?

325
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:58,728
It does...

326
00:28:58,728 --> 00:29:00,200
...exist. I can take you.

327
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,597
Unchain me and give me the trident.

328
00:29:02,597 --> 00:29:06,141
If you unchain him, he will jump off
this boat, you will never see him again.

329
00:29:06,141 --> 00:29:08,506
Hephaestus can help you save your father.

330
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,736
Don't let our family down.

331
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,458
Never doubted you for a second, Agenor.

332
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,033
Great Kronos.

333
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:40,228
Father.

334
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:44,299
We have delivered Zeus, your son...

335
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,471
...as you ordered.

336
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:49,663
Zeus.

337
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,889
Island of Kail.

338
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,402
I am not touching that again.

339
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:34,916
What is it?

340
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:38,884
I don't know. But whoever
did this doesn't want us here.

341
00:31:38,884 --> 00:31:40,087
We have no choice.

342
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,525
Fallen god has to live as close
to the heavens as possible.

343
00:31:43,525 --> 00:31:44,759
Streams run through.

344
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:46,733
Higher ground's that way.

345
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,197
- What...?
- Look.

346
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,134
Don't move.

347
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:27,976
I can't see nothing.

348
00:32:27,976 --> 00:32:30,171
We should pray to the god of war.
Warriors.

349
00:32:30,171 --> 00:32:33,909
I know it is your custom, but no
matter what we're about to face...

350
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:35,848
...you do not pray to Ares.

351
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:40,347
If you do, he will
find us and kill us all.

352
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,487
Close in.

353
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,819
Stay alert.

354
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:53,734
Trip wire.

355
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:56,338
- Agenor.
- Yeah, yeah. Saw it.

356
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:06,045
The most important thing
is to do nothing.

357
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:08,107
Nothing, I can do well.

358
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,221
Aah. For the love of Zeus.

359
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:15,018
I told you to do nothing.

360
00:33:15,018 --> 00:33:17,283
I didn't do anything.
Just stay still.

361
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,556
No, no, no.

362
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:23,891
Cut the counterweights.

363
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,205
Don't cut the counterweight.

364
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,341
Yeah, he's right,
the fall will kill him.

365
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:48,725
Cut the counterweight.
Cut the counterweight.

366
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:55,892
Agenor.

367
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:59,936
Cut the counterweight.
Cut the counterweight.

368
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,364
Agenor.

369
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,734
Agenor.

370
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,226
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

371
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,536
Stay down.

372
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,467
Ah.

373
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:40,372
What is it?

374
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:41,834
Big.

375
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:43,536
Andromeda, slow him down.

376
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:57,286
Now.

377
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,289
Archers.

378
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,389
Galenos...

379
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,862
...give him support. You, follow me.

380
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,112
No.

381
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,210
I pray to you, great god Ares.
I pray to you...

382
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:56,613
Shh.

383
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:04,825
Is it gone?

384
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,742
Hey.

385
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,941
This is going to be a bad idea.

386
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,583
Where's my cousin?

387
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,569
Glad you're hanging in there.

388
00:37:54,569 --> 00:37:56,764
Yeah, I thought I'd give him an eyeful.

389
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,174
What was that for?

390
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,978
Poseidon.

391
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,466
Poor Ares, always...

392
00:38:29,466 --> 00:38:31,107
...following orders.

393
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,210
I am my own master.

394
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,512
Yes, of course you are.

395
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,543
Perhaps it's only humans...

396
00:38:39,543 --> 00:38:40,979
...that have free will.

397
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,318
There.

398
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:51,521
Pain. Your lesson in being human.

399
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:53,663
Why don't you weep?

400
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:56,025
Why don't you weep like
your favorite son, Perseus?

401
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:04,039
If I weep, it will be for you, Ares.

402
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:07,170
Ares.

403
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,043
Enough.

404
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,470
Weep for your son.

405
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,048
I said...

406
00:39:13,048 --> 00:39:14,479
...enough.

407
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,812
We are in this together, Hades.

408
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,148
Do not weaken now.

409
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:24,158
Your weakness is your blind hatred
for your father and your brother.

410
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:29,356
You don't know when to stop fighting.

411
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,531
You have already won.

412
00:39:31,531 --> 00:39:35,331
Kronos is draining Zeus' power.

413
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:23,450
Hephaestus.

414
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,573
Zeus?

415
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,499
Ares.

416
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,472
Hades.

417
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:51,214
At last. I knew you'd come.

418
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:54,851
Poseidon,
I can see your trident glinting.

419
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,754
Ha-ha-ha. Ah.

420
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:00,987
It's not...

421
00:41:00,987 --> 00:41:02,216
...them.

422
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,427
We're looking for Hephaestus,
the maker...

423
00:41:07,427 --> 00:41:11,125
...of such mighty weapons.
Well, should I let them in?

424
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,827
He says no.

425
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:18,335
But then he always says no.

426
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,313
He always says...

427
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:25,781
...no.

428
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:26,677
Ahh.

429
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:28,845
Yes.

430
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,495
You are Perseus...

431
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:40,888
...son of Zeus.

432
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:43,524
I am.

433
00:41:43,524 --> 00:41:46,261
"Release the Kraken," all of that.

434
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,072
Yeah. Who are you?

435
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,800
I am Agenor, son of Poseidon.

436
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,536
Agenor.

437
00:41:58,048 --> 00:41:59,982
Have you ever heard of Agenor?

438
00:41:59,982 --> 00:42:02,311
Never heard of you.

439
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,655
Well, your friend may also
know me by the name...

440
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,918
...the Navigator.

441
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:11,087
Navigator?

442
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,395
Navigator.

443
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,891
Still no.

444
00:42:17,891 --> 00:42:21,060
Don't worry, son, he says
there are many useless demigods.

445
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:25,439
"Useless"? About as useless
as your one-eyed friends.

446
00:42:25,439 --> 00:42:26,667
Those Cyclopes...

447
00:42:26,667 --> 00:42:29,438
...helped me forge the god-weapons.

448
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,574
Have respect.

449
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,579
"Navigator."

450
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:40,223
Mm-hm.

451
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:42,883
Hold on, because...

452
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:47,853
Poseidon dead, Zeus captured.
The words...

453
00:42:47,853 --> 00:42:49,522
...don't even sit together.

454
00:42:49,522 --> 00:42:51,565
We need your help to rescue Zeus...

455
00:42:51,565 --> 00:42:53,362
...so he can stop Kronos.

456
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:57,532
- That's the plan, is it?
- Yeah.

457
00:42:57,532 --> 00:43:01,576
Right. Right. Well, in that case,
we'd best prepare.

458
00:43:01,576 --> 00:43:04,305
For what?
The end of the bloody world.

459
00:43:04,305 --> 00:43:06,449
Kronos will dismantle the earth.

460
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,778
You will be scattered
across the universe.

461
00:43:09,778 --> 00:43:11,387
Fantastic.

462
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,957
You forged these weapons...

463
00:43:14,957 --> 00:43:17,889
...right here for the gods.
You must be able to help us.

464
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,626
Shut it. How could I...

465
00:43:20,626 --> 00:43:22,265
...when I have no godly power anymore?

466
00:43:22,265 --> 00:43:23,229
Who's he talking to?

467
00:43:23,229 --> 00:43:24,799
Don't you...

468
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,231
...walk away from me.

469
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:29,133
His all-powerful father
took it away from me...

470
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:32,171
...when I sided with Hades
in their little family argument.

471
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:36,403
Yes, I know now it was a mistake.

472
00:43:36,403 --> 00:43:38,810
People forget.

473
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:43,846
In the beginning, Hades was wise...

474
00:43:43,846 --> 00:43:47,821
...and just and strong.

475
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:51,523
It were your daddy became drunk on power.

476
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,025
We were even hoping...

477
00:43:54,025 --> 00:43:58,692
...when Zeus came he might see
his mistake and restore our...

478
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,170
Why not? He might have, had he come.

479
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:09,941
I am sorry...

480
00:44:09,941 --> 00:44:13,106
...that you think being human
is not enough. But we humans...

481
00:44:13,106 --> 00:44:15,774
...hope when there's no hope.

482
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,649
And we believe when to believe is idiotic.

483
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,658
But sometimes, in spite...

484
00:44:22,658 --> 00:44:25,294
...of everything, we prevail.

485
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:28,656
Now...

486
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:32,566
...which of you two...

487
00:44:32,566 --> 00:44:34,499
...is in charge?

488
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:36,066
- I am.
- Then...

489
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:40,443
...if we were gods...

490
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,840
...how would you help us free Zeus?

491
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:47,180
Oh, my dear.

492
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:50,751
You remind me of someone.

493
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:55,451
Aphrodite.

494
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,385
She was my wife.

495
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,995
Come with me.

496
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:05,933
If Zeus is captive in the underworld...

497
00:45:05,933 --> 00:45:09,231
...he's likely being held
in the heart of Tartarus.

498
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,741
There can't be much time
before his life force...

499
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:15,037
...is completely sapped.

500
00:45:15,037 --> 00:45:17,043
But how do we get to him?

501
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:18,578
We can't.

502
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:20,613
Normally you'd be right, young man.

503
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,550
But when I designed this marvel...

504
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,454
...I included a secret
passage, a shortcut...

505
00:45:32,454 --> 00:45:33,687
...if you will.

506
00:45:33,687 --> 00:45:35,991
- You designed Tartarus?
- Oh, aye.

507
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,057
And built it.

508
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:40,728
Aphrodite, I could...

509
00:45:40,728 --> 00:45:43,202
...not only get you inside...

510
00:45:43,202 --> 00:45:46,740
...I could give you a guided tour.

511
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,413
In order for the prison of Tartarus...

512
00:45:53,413 --> 00:45:55,814
...to be completely impregnable...

513
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,920
...I built it from the outside in.

514
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,922
So I had to leave a passage
for meself to get out...

515
00:46:01,922 --> 00:46:04,959
...when the work was done.
And this labyrinth...

516
00:46:04,959 --> 00:46:08,326
...is the only way a human
can travel through the underworld...

517
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:12,298
...and get to the heart of Tartarus.

518
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:46,492
Where's my snarling bastard of a son Ares?

519
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:50,437
Will Kronos really spare him?

520
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:52,535
And you?

521
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,370
Is there no end to this?

522
00:46:58,115 --> 00:46:59,275
I am afraid, brother.

523
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,646
Is that what you want me to say?
I am a god and I am afraid.

524
00:47:02,646 --> 00:47:03,787
Well, you should be.

525
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:08,583
When your precious humans die,
at least their souls go to another place.

526
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:12,093
When a god dies, it isn't death.

527
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:14,496
It's just absence.

528
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,228
It's nothing.

529
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,500
It's oblivion.

530
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,537
It's oblivion.

531
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:30,837
Perseus.

532
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,042
Perseus.

533
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:38,688
Father.

534
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:42,551
I am close.

535
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:44,518
Stay with me.

536
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,387
You see, if you align
the edges correctly...

537
00:47:47,387 --> 00:47:50,260
...it gives you a shifting depiction
of the interior.

538
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,229
Can I say, that is a masterpiece.

539
00:47:52,229 --> 00:47:54,233
Well, useful to a point.

540
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:56,998
Would you let a lowly navigator hold it?
No.

541
00:47:56,998 --> 00:48:00,405
Well, you are the son of Poseidon.

542
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:05,113
He's the one who taught me to navigate.
That, and how to seduce a mermaid...

543
00:48:05,113 --> 00:48:07,682
...which seemed random,
but came in handy more often...

544
00:48:07,682 --> 00:48:10,217
...than you'd think.
Thing to do is...

545
00:48:10,217 --> 00:48:13,220
...don't talk to her,
talk to her friend.

546
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:19,921
Navigator, this is the entrance
to the labyrinth.

547
00:48:19,921 --> 00:48:24,227
There are hundreds of doors,
all of which would kill you...

548
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,102
...save one. You see...

549
00:48:27,102 --> 00:48:28,704
...I designed it to play...

550
00:48:28,704 --> 00:48:31,272
...tricks with the mind.
After all, the mind...

551
00:48:31,272 --> 00:48:32,931
...is the greatest trap of all.

552
00:48:32,931 --> 00:48:36,079
So you have got to control your fears...

553
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,737
...so you don't turn on yourself
or each other...

554
00:48:38,737 --> 00:48:41,111
...if you want to make it to Tartarus.

555
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:49,985
There it is.

556
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:51,956
There's our door.

557
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:57,593
Everybody back.

558
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:08,405
Oh.

559
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,073
Which one of you prayed to him?

560
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,139
You betrayed our father.

561
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:46,878
He betrayed me...

562
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,175
...by choosing you.

563
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,144
You beauty.

564
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:23,682
Come on. It won't stay open...

565
00:50:23,682 --> 00:50:24,878
...for long.

566
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:38,227
No, not now.

567
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:50,608
Great god Ares...

568
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:53,681
...be merciful. It was I who prayed
to you. I was taught...

569
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:57,049
...to pray for my enemies.
I prayed you would find peace...

570
00:50:57,049 --> 00:50:59,450
...in your heart... Ah. Ah.

571
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:06,760
We are brothers...

572
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:08,557
...but not equal.

573
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:16,396
I have got to give them more time.

574
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:28,641
One last godly thing.

575
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:29,910
Come on.

576
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,885
Let's see what you blee....

577
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:34,989
Perseus.

578
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,583
Hephaestus.

579
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:39,590
Aah.

580
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:43,764
Perseus. The door's...

581
00:51:43,764 --> 00:51:45,299
...closing. Come on.

582
00:51:45,299 --> 00:51:46,561
Ares.

583
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,435
Is that all you got...

584
00:51:49,435 --> 00:51:50,573
...you sniveling...

585
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:52,499
...dog?

586
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:54,801
Get to the door.

587
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,113
- Come on.
- Come on.

588
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:22,899
Oh, Korrina.

589
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:26,665
She was a fool to pray to him...

590
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:30,870
...and he was a coward to kill the weak.

591
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:33,641
He has fought in many wars.

592
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,011
He's slaughtered innocents for centuries.

593
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:37,612
It's all...

594
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:38,811
...he knows.

595
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:41,549
I can't beat him.

596
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,314
Mutton head.

597
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:47,054
Two days ago I was trapped in a cell
in a dungeon, admittedly...

598
00:52:47,054 --> 00:52:50,358
...trying to escape,
unbecoming of the son of Poseidon.

599
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:55,035
But today I am here,
and I am trying to save the universe.

600
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:56,734
Jump in.

601
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,577
Your Majesty...

602
00:53:07,577 --> 00:53:11,084
...I realize in a labyrinth
with a million possibilities...

603
00:53:11,084 --> 00:53:13,781
...this is the last thing
you want to hear but...

604
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,458
...follow me.

605
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:22,829
That way.

606
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,403
Or this way.

607
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:48,683
I don't know...

608
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:50,883
...how we will get through this
without Hephaestus.

609
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,130
Perseus.

610
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:06,241
Where is your son?

611
00:54:17,085 --> 00:54:18,882
This way.

612
00:54:25,027 --> 00:54:26,289
That way.

613
00:54:48,617 --> 00:54:50,050
This way.

614
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,585
Andromeda.

615
00:55:03,298 --> 00:55:04,765
Korrina.

616
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:07,430
You must turn back.

617
00:55:15,611 --> 00:55:16,441
This should be...

618
00:55:16,441 --> 00:55:18,773
...a corridor.
This map makes no sense.

619
00:55:18,981 --> 00:55:20,505
Andromeda.

620
00:55:24,486 --> 00:55:26,386
There's something in here with us.

621
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:30,858
- Just give me the map.
- No.

622
00:55:31,126 --> 00:55:33,686
The mighty Kraken slayer.
Shouldn't he be somewhere...

623
00:55:33,686 --> 00:55:35,523
...posing for a statue? Agenor...

624
00:55:35,523 --> 00:55:38,666
...just give me the map.
The map is useless.

625
00:55:47,342 --> 00:55:48,331
This way.

626
00:55:54,116 --> 00:55:54,844
Agenor.

627
00:55:57,719 --> 00:55:59,516
I know where we're going.

628
00:56:06,328 --> 00:56:07,625
This way.

629
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,700
Get back.

630
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:29,409
Back.

631
00:56:36,525 --> 00:56:37,549
Get up.

632
00:56:50,238 --> 00:56:50,966
Andromeda.

633
00:56:57,279 --> 00:56:58,303
Yes.

634
00:57:09,391 --> 00:57:10,881
Take the weight.

635
00:57:16,565 --> 00:57:18,328
Come on, come on, come on.

636
00:57:22,004 --> 00:57:23,335
Go, go.

637
00:57:23,739 --> 00:57:25,001
Go.

638
00:58:11,153 --> 00:58:12,882
It's cold in here, isn't it?

639
00:58:29,504 --> 00:58:31,335
You're not real.

640
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,535
Helius?

641
01:00:01,997 --> 01:00:05,899
Why are you doing this?
Please, Dad, don't kill me.

642
01:01:06,027 --> 01:01:08,325
- Perseus.
- Perseus.

643
01:01:08,797 --> 01:01:10,059
What happened?

644
01:01:16,638 --> 01:01:17,627
Tartarus.

645
01:01:20,508 --> 01:01:21,497
Come on, let's go.

646
01:01:22,811 --> 01:01:23,641
Come on.

647
01:01:33,388 --> 01:01:36,482
Kronos has his power now.

648
01:01:37,759 --> 01:01:39,351
Hades.

649
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:43,263
I am so sorry.

650
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:45,257
For what?

651
01:01:46,001 --> 01:01:47,491
For having banished you.

652
01:01:49,671 --> 01:01:51,400
Can you forgive me for that?

653
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:54,167
Why do you ask?

654
01:01:55,777 --> 01:01:58,473
Because I forgive you for this.

655
01:02:00,415 --> 01:02:02,508
Release me, Hades.

656
01:02:02,508 --> 01:02:05,209
I know there is still good in you.

657
01:02:13,595 --> 01:02:15,995
You have no pride, Hades.

658
01:02:17,032 --> 01:02:18,192
No.

659
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:21,362
I won't let you kill him.

660
01:02:23,271 --> 01:02:24,499
Brother.

661
01:02:28,143 --> 01:02:29,610
You can't stop this.

662
01:02:46,594 --> 01:02:47,891
Ares.

663
01:03:19,794 --> 01:03:21,091
Come on.

664
01:03:28,303 --> 01:03:29,702
Go, go.

665
01:03:35,076 --> 01:03:36,941
Father. Father.

666
01:03:37,512 --> 01:03:38,342
Father.

667
01:03:38,342 --> 01:03:39,673
Open your eyes.

668
01:03:41,716 --> 01:03:43,206
Perseus.

669
01:03:44,486 --> 01:03:46,511
Perseus, my son.

670
01:04:04,806 --> 01:04:06,899
Use the power inside you.

671
01:04:33,068 --> 01:04:33,762
Perseus...

672
01:04:33,762 --> 01:04:34,629
...hurry.

673
01:04:59,427 --> 01:05:01,019
Ares. Andromeda.

674
01:05:18,713 --> 01:05:19,611
Hades...

675
01:05:19,611 --> 01:05:20,805
...come with us.

676
01:05:46,474 --> 01:05:47,805
No.

677
01:05:50,478 --> 01:05:53,139
Hades.......

678
01:06:00,955 --> 01:06:02,786
Weapon. Give it to me.

679
01:06:04,325 --> 01:06:05,622
Hold them.

680
01:06:40,028 --> 01:06:40,960
Mantius, impressive.

681
01:06:41,362 --> 01:06:44,798
- You gathered a fine army.
- I have prepared a royal tent.

682
01:06:44,798 --> 01:06:46,558
And is it fit for a god?

683
01:06:47,202 --> 01:06:48,794
Great Zeus. Great Zeus.

684
01:06:48,794 --> 01:06:50,460
Great Zeus.

685
01:06:56,578 --> 01:06:57,237
Kronos...

686
01:06:57,237 --> 01:07:00,210
...will come for me, Perseus.

687
01:07:00,582 --> 01:07:02,982
I don't have the power left to stop him.

688
01:07:06,054 --> 01:07:07,078
I wanted...

689
01:07:07,078 --> 01:07:09,688
...to leave the world safe for you.
I failed.

690
01:07:10,525 --> 01:07:12,755
I should have come with you.

691
01:07:12,755 --> 01:07:14,417
- I was just...
- You pulled me...

692
01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:16,496
...out of Tartarus.

693
01:07:17,865 --> 01:07:19,162
You saved me.

694
01:07:20,335 --> 01:07:22,803
How do you suppose you did that?

695
01:07:23,705 --> 01:07:26,765
I never stopped thinking about
getting home to my son. Then...

696
01:07:26,765 --> 01:07:29,808
...you use that.
Fight for your son.

697
01:07:30,845 --> 01:07:32,107
Remember:

698
01:07:33,014 --> 01:07:35,949
Only the Spear of Trium can defeat Kronos.

699
01:07:35,949 --> 01:07:38,677
And the hand that holds that spear
will have to be...

700
01:07:38,677 --> 01:07:39,911
...yours.

701
01:07:46,227 --> 01:07:48,821
We have two pieces of the Spear of Trium.

702
01:07:50,131 --> 01:07:51,860
Poseidon's trident...

703
01:07:53,534 --> 01:07:54,728
...and Hades' pitchfork.

704
01:07:54,728 --> 01:07:57,234
So, what we need is Zeus' thunderbolt.

705
01:07:57,234 --> 01:07:58,929
Which is on Ares' back.

706
01:08:01,976 --> 01:08:03,136
Yep.

707
01:08:05,146 --> 01:08:06,272
Ares.

708
01:08:07,482 --> 01:08:08,972
Ares.

709
01:08:09,751 --> 01:08:10,775
Ares.

710
01:08:11,853 --> 01:08:13,150
Brother.

711
01:08:15,089 --> 01:08:16,886
I pray to you.

712
01:08:18,226 --> 01:08:20,660
Meet me at the temple of the gods.

713
01:08:23,164 --> 01:08:25,098
You say we're not equal.

714
01:08:27,602 --> 01:08:28,830
So come prove to me...

715
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:29,992
...you're right.

716
01:08:33,641 --> 01:08:36,769
Prove to our father that you're right.

717
01:08:38,746 --> 01:08:40,509
I hear you, brother.

718
01:08:47,822 --> 01:08:49,517
I will get the spear.
You hold him off.

719
01:08:56,431 --> 01:08:57,762
Don't give me the big speech.

720
01:08:58,533 --> 01:09:00,467
Yeah, I wasn't planning to.

721
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:24,788
Our battle plan...

722
01:09:25,426 --> 01:09:26,484
...must be simple.

723
01:09:26,794 --> 01:09:28,159
Three lines of defense:

724
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:30,388
Agenor's men will hold the front line...

725
01:09:30,388 --> 01:09:31,657
...from the trenches.

726
01:09:31,657 --> 01:09:32,697
Cover every part...

727
01:09:32,697 --> 01:09:34,664
...of yourself, or you will be burned...

728
01:09:34,664 --> 01:09:35,962
...by the fire.

729
01:09:35,962 --> 01:09:37,798
Every piece of cloth...

730
01:09:38,306 --> 01:09:40,467
...every piece of skin. Help each other.

731
01:09:40,675 --> 01:09:41,801
Phalanxes behind that...

732
01:09:41,801 --> 01:09:44,069
...and infantry as the last defense.

733
01:09:44,879 --> 01:09:46,437
I will lead the infantry myself.

734
01:09:47,248 --> 01:09:48,408
And our job...

735
01:09:48,408 --> 01:09:51,848
...is to hold Kronos back
for as long as possible...

736
01:09:51,848 --> 01:09:54,146
...if we're to stand a chance.

737
01:09:55,390 --> 01:09:57,824
- Dig in.
- Position.

738
01:10:00,094 --> 01:10:01,584
Secure positions.

739
01:10:46,073 --> 01:10:47,734
Kronos is near.

740
01:11:01,756 --> 01:11:03,553
Makhai.

741
01:11:04,392 --> 01:11:06,019
Makhai.

742
01:11:17,939 --> 01:11:19,804
Light the fires.

743
01:11:20,107 --> 01:11:23,304
- Light the fires.
- Light the fires.

744
01:11:26,747 --> 01:11:27,771
Hold.

745
01:11:33,688 --> 01:11:35,178
Fire the artillery.

746
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:36,679
Loose.

747
01:11:39,093 --> 01:11:40,424
Fire.

748
01:12:14,095 --> 01:12:15,528
Brother.

749
01:12:27,608 --> 01:12:28,870
Brother.

750
01:12:31,112 --> 01:12:34,513
- Please don't hurt him.
- I am not going to hurt him.

751
01:12:34,715 --> 01:12:36,182
I am going to hurt you.

752
01:12:37,318 --> 01:12:38,512
And I want him to watch.

753
01:12:39,554 --> 01:12:41,044
I want you to know...

754
01:12:41,722 --> 01:12:43,246
...what it feels like...

755
01:12:43,246 --> 01:12:47,224
...when someone takes your
father away from you.

756
01:14:12,513 --> 01:14:13,741
Front line, attack.

757
01:14:14,348 --> 01:14:15,212
Stay with me.

758
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:17,408
Stand firm.

759
01:15:12,707 --> 01:15:14,197
So this is what a father...

760
01:15:14,197 --> 01:15:16,536
...would go through for his son?

761
01:15:44,038 --> 01:15:45,369
Brother.

762
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:49,039
Brother.

763
01:15:50,578 --> 01:15:52,045
I do...

764
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:54,841
...forgive you.

765
01:16:18,405 --> 01:16:19,064
You look...

766
01:16:19,064 --> 01:16:21,470
...10,000 years younger.

767
01:16:21,942 --> 01:16:23,102
And feel it.

768
01:16:28,482 --> 01:16:31,383
Death was circling you.

769
01:16:31,886 --> 01:16:35,117
That was the last time I will have
the strength to chase it away.

770
01:16:37,224 --> 01:16:38,122
We have the power...

771
01:16:38,122 --> 01:16:41,955
...between us to put on a little display.

772
01:16:41,955 --> 01:16:43,118
Like in the old days.

773
01:16:44,098 --> 01:16:45,395
So shall we finish this?

774
01:16:45,395 --> 01:16:46,464
We have no weapons.

775
01:16:46,464 --> 01:16:48,465
We had power before we had weapons.

776
01:16:48,465 --> 01:16:50,433
- When we were young gods.
- Yes.

777
01:16:51,472 --> 01:16:52,496
Let's have some fun.

778
01:19:15,783 --> 01:19:18,047
Helius. Weapons.

779
01:19:36,537 --> 01:19:38,835
Hold the line. Hold the line.

780
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:40,267
Stand firm.

781
01:19:55,556 --> 01:19:56,784
The Spear of Trium.

782
01:20:10,704 --> 01:20:13,424
Hades.......

783
01:20:20,114 --> 01:20:22,082
Zeus.....

784
01:20:22,082 --> 01:20:24,107
The first strike's mine, brother.

785
01:21:02,156 --> 01:21:03,316
Perseus.

786
01:22:13,894 --> 01:22:15,327
Together now, brother.

787
01:22:33,714 --> 01:22:36,774
This is it, boy.
They have given us a chance.

788
01:23:03,477 --> 01:23:04,375
Brother.

789
01:24:07,307 --> 01:24:08,899
Come on, stand up.

790
01:24:22,589 --> 01:24:26,047
Perseus. Perseus. Perseus.

791
01:25:00,927 --> 01:25:02,758
He's waiting for you...

792
01:25:04,164 --> 01:25:05,961
...before he goes.

793
01:25:27,921 --> 01:25:30,151
Your boy gave you strength.

794
01:25:31,458 --> 01:25:32,652
Yes.

795
01:25:33,827 --> 01:25:35,590
As did mine.

796
01:25:40,434 --> 01:25:42,629
Perhaps Hades can heal you.

797
01:25:42,969 --> 01:25:45,164
He already gave me my last chance.

798
01:25:50,007 --> 01:25:52,809
And you sacrificed it for him.

799
01:25:54,348 --> 01:25:57,010
There will be no more sacrifices.

800
01:25:58,819 --> 01:26:00,719
No more gods.

801
01:26:05,726 --> 01:26:08,991
Use your power wisely, Perseus.

802
01:26:27,013 --> 01:26:29,880
Thank you, my son.

803
01:26:59,212 --> 01:27:01,840
All my power is spent.

804
01:27:05,485 --> 01:27:06,918
Who knows?

805
01:27:08,555 --> 01:27:11,217
I might be stronger without it.

806
01:27:26,006 --> 01:27:28,736
I know it's broke. No need to tell me.

807
01:27:28,942 --> 01:27:31,308
I could walk on it, but....
My mum always said...

808
01:27:31,511 --> 01:27:34,742
...you should let everyone have
their moment to shine. You know?

809
01:27:34,742 --> 01:27:37,884
So, you know, I am established.
I have already got a name.

810
01:27:37,884 --> 01:27:40,611
You know? The Navigator.

811
01:27:43,323 --> 01:27:44,915
If I am not mistaken...

812
01:27:45,625 --> 01:27:48,560
...you're the son of Perseus.
I am Helius.

813
01:27:48,762 --> 01:27:51,128
Is that your boy, Helius?

814
01:28:00,273 --> 01:28:01,535
Go over there.

815
01:28:03,443 --> 01:28:04,432
Helius.

816
01:28:05,178 --> 01:28:05,974
Come here.

817
01:28:05,974 --> 01:28:08,307
I have got a story to tell.
Come and meet...

818
01:28:08,307 --> 01:28:10,143
...your Uncle Navigator.

819
01:28:20,126 --> 01:28:21,593
I am Agenor.

820
01:28:21,928 --> 01:28:23,259
Helius.

821
01:28:23,259 --> 01:28:26,695
I have read that you are
a great disappointment.

822
01:28:27,133 --> 01:28:29,101
That's right, I am great.

823
01:28:29,101 --> 01:28:31,294
This is my nurse, Tiger.

824
01:28:45,385 --> 01:28:47,649
We have to be prepared
if there's another attack.

825
01:28:47,649 --> 01:28:49,982
We're fortifying Argos
with the third regiment.

826
01:28:49,982 --> 01:28:53,284
Our engines will be ready in two days,
so in the west we can...

827
01:29:12,412 --> 01:29:13,640
Dad...

828
01:29:14,548 --> 01:29:17,210
...I am actually looking forward
to going home.

829
01:29:18,018 --> 01:29:22,216
I have decided being a boring fisherman
isn't that bad.

830
01:29:23,056 --> 01:29:25,183
You know we can't go back home.

831
01:29:42,142 --> 01:29:43,370
Take it.

832
01:29:48,348 --> 01:29:49,906
You're Helius.

833
01:29:52,052 --> 01:29:53,917
You're son of Perseus...

834
01:29:54,354 --> 01:29:56,345
...the grandson of Zeus.

835
01:29:59,526 --> 01:30:00,720
Take it.

836
01:30:11,705 --> 01:30:13,036
It's heavy.

837
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:15,605
Yeah, it is.

838
01:30:18,311 --> 01:30:19,903
Is it too much?

839
01:30:27,454 --> 01:30:28,716
No.
