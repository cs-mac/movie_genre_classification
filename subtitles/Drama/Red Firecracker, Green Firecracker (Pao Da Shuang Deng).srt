00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:05,175
Episode 82

3
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:14,053
Let's eat! Why aren't you eating?

4
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,053
Okay, all the dishes are ready.

5
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,066
Ai-Jia...

6
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,301
Are you okay?

7
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,310
I'm fine, don't worry about me.

8
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,073
Let's have our meal.

9
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,049
I admit that I'm upset.

10
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:48,321
Upset that Zhong-Qi left with one letter.

11
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:52,091
But I believe that...

12
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:55,066
Zhong-Qi's eyes will get well.

13
00:00:56,322 --> 00:01:00,031
And mother will bring him back.

14
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:05,071
I will wait for him. I
will surely wait for him!

15
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,341
Father.

16
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,344
From now on,

17
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,279
I'm Zhong-Qi's wife,

18
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:17,049
daughter-in-law
of family Qin.

19
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:18,317
Of course you are.

20
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:21,325
You are pad of family Qin.

21
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:23,321
Mother...

22
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,326
But Zhong-Qi
now... -Father.

23
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,321
Zhong-Qi and I wore

24
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,194
the rings in front of God.

25
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:34,068
God witnessed our marriage,

26
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,062
you must accept me.

27
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:41,034
Yes, you are my
daughter-in-law,

28
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,274
but it's unfair for you.

29
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,338
No, it's not.

30
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,318
From today onwards,

31
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,048
I will use my profession,

32
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,045
to protect family Qin,

33
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,058
and also my family.

34
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,060
I will also be dedicated

35
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,187
to do what I should do,

36
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,323
and never abandon my duty.

37
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,329
I will be patient.

38
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,061
I will wait for Zhong-Qi.

39
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,068
Grandma...

40
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,043
I'm your bodyguard in the future.

41
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,045
You are not only my bodyguard,

42
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,307
you are our bodyguard,

43
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:19,078
you are family Qin's bodyguard.

44
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,083
Let's eat!

45
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,280
This is cook by my grandson's wife.

46
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,082
Quick!

47
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,181
Everyone, let's eat.

48
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,122
We have to move on.

49
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:29,092
This is delicious.

50
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,061
Yes, they are.

51
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,291
This is good.

52
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,162
Delicious,
sister-in-law.

53
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,326
You have improved a lot.

54
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,336
Teach me next time.

55
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,038
November 26th, 2012.

56
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,044
Cloudy.

57
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:52,049
Zhong-Qi, how are you?

58
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,347
I'm fine here, learning

59
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,048
to be a good wife.

60
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:01,081
But my husband is not with me.

61
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,094
I miss you.

62
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,062
I really miss you.

63
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:16,068
December 25th, 2012.

64
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,096
Rainy.

65
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,304
Zhong-Qi, I've

66
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,312
waited for one month.

67
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,042
Today is Christmas day.

68
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,346
Merry Christmas to you.

69
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,281
It is snowing at your side.

70
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,050
I hate you for not

71
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,284
bringing me to see it snows.

72
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,191
You must compensate me

73
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,092
when you come back.

74
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,060
Everyone is good.

75
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,226
Father is healthy as well.

76
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:46,066
We will take care of him.

77
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,040
Recently I learnt a few

78
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,043
new dishes from Aunt Qin-Mei.

79
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,339
I'll cook all for you

80
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,307
when you come back.

81
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,038
How is mother? Is she alright?

82
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,329
Zhong-Qi's first

83
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,327
surgery failed.

84
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,335
January 10th, 2013.

85
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:41,048
Ya-Lun, I have a strong feeling

86
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,084
during this time when I saw Ai-Jia

87
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:49,032
waiting for Zhong-Qi.

88
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,295
That is...

89
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,070
That is...

90
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,299
I need to apologize

91
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,069
to you during this time.

92
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:00,202
I insisted in keeping this baby

93
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,305
to make you worry and scared,

94
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,078
and you spent your
effort taking care of us.

95
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,244
You must be in pressure, am I right?

96
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:11,154
And you have to deal with my father,

97
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:14,090
I bet you must feel uncomfortable.

98
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:15,353
Why did you say so?

99
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,050
We need to spent the
rest of our life together.

100
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,063
We must share it together.

101
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:22,032
And this baby belongs

102
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,193
to both of us.

103
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,099
I believe we can

104
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,296
have a healthy

105
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:29,067
baby

106
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,199
The most important thing is

107
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,073
to have a healthy mother

108
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,303
to grow up with him.

109
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,081
When I see the big

110
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,209
changes on Ai-Jia,

111
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,309
I have this little...

112
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,083
Tiny little thinking.

113
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,316
Is this little?

114
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,154
Or this tiny little?

115
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,318
Or this tiny little bit?

116
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:51,328
This tiny little...

117
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,058
I'm touched by

118
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,033
Ai-Jia's wedding.

119
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,194
I've been crying loudly.

120
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,295
And the image was so

121
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,069
beautiful and sacred.

122
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,302
To be honest,

123
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,176
I don't want to regret.

124
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,271
So my dear boyfriend,

125
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,078
let's get married.

126
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,068
Impossible. I can't go

127
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,070
and attend your wedding.

128
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,036
Let me ask you.

129
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,168
What is your purpose

130
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,302
of marrying her?

131
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,334
Is it because of the baby

132
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:42,307
she's having now?

133
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,071
Or you want to give her an identity?

134
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,052
This is too ridiculous.

135
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,314
Listen carefully!

136
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,310
You want to protect your baby,

137
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,046
I want to protect my daughter.

138
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,060
Do you hear me?

139
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,083
And you...

140
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,221
I can grant your wishes.

141
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,094
Why can't you promise me

142
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,224
when it's the only

143
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,131
time that I asked you?

144
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,102
Why do you risk your

145
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,070
life to have this baby?

146
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,299
Father, Cai-Jie knows.

147
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,328
I don't want to talk to you.

148
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,171
Don't call me father.

149
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,267
You didn't persuade her

150
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,175
to take care of herself,

151
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,338
but you supported her.

152
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,036
You are such selfish person!

153
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,275
Immature!

154
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,181
You totally didn't care

155
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,117
about Cai-Jie's life.

156
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,052
You are such a jerk!

157
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,284
You are being irresponsible.

158
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:28,087
Father, I love Cai-Jie,

159
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,092
that's why...

160
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,025
Father...

161
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,323
Ya-Lun knows what I want

162
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,031
so he supported me.

163
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,327
No matter how dangerous

164
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,329
I am being pregnant, he

165
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:40,065
is pan of me now.

166
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:43,301
Father, I believe you understand.

167
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,206
I can't let go,

168
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,041
and I won't let go,

169
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,044
just like how I won't let

170
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,343
go our relationship.

171
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,045
To me, owning

172
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,053
the relationship means

173
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,055
owning the happiness,

174
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,318
do you understand?

175
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,047
Okay.

176
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,321
You can do whatever you
want. I can't control you.

177
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,321
But you, listen carefully!

178
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:11,058
If Cai-Jie is being hurt

179
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,059
I won't forgive you.

180
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,035
You can go out now.

181
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,301
Father, I want you to walk
me down the red carpet.

182
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,316
I want you to hold my hands.

183
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,047
Father, I'm talking to you.

184
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,077
Why didn't you reply me?

185
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:34,058
It's been such hard work

186
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,287
that I found both of you.

187
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,290
Do you want me to see

188
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:42,026
you disappear just like that?

189
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,199
I cannot bear the

190
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,170
risk of losing you.

191
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,070
But you wanted to

192
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,042
to be worried and afraid.

193
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:58,179
Now you are getting married,

194
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,310
but I can't congratulate you.

195
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,324
Do you know why?

196
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,326
Because I'm afraid...

197
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:19,325
I'm afraid of losing you again.

198
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,063
Do you understand now?

199
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,342
Go out! Go out now!

200
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,080
Father.

201
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,280
I'm afraid...

202
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,050
I'm afraid of losing Cai-Jie.

203
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,052
But I chose to stay by her side,

204
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,060
to give her courage,

205
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,356
because this is what she

206
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,053
insisted to do.

207
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,067
If you can accompany her,

208
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,069
she can face this unchanged

209
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,301
fact bravely, father...

210
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,334
I hand my daughter to you.

211
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,335
Father Zhen, thank you.

212
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,276
Please be happy.

213
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,284
I'm considered your father as well.

214
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,286
I know.

215
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:54,051
She's pregnant, please be careful.

216
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,167
Before the actual wedding ceremony,

217
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:10,037
the groom's relative would like

218
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,167
to send their blessings through a video.

219
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,303
Now let's watch this video together.

220
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:21,308
I'm sorry, I need to congratulate

221
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,281
Cai-Jie and Ya-Lun
through this video.

222
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,051
Your wedding...

223
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,058
Aunt has been watching

224
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,060
you since the beginning.

225
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,153
I believe that you

226
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,253
can have a happy

227
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,162
and perfect marriage.

228
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,292
At the same time,

229
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,202
I want to pray for your family,

230
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,105
especially to Cai-Jie and your

231
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,200
baby to be healthy

232
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,302
and stay safe.

233
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:52,311
Yes, there's one important

234
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,080
person wants to send his blessings.

235
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,220
Actually I should

236
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,199
sincerely congratulate

237
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,235
brother and Cai-Jie.

238
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,169
But I don't want everyone

239
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,206
to see my face now.

240
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,334
I'm sorry.

241
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:21,169
I'm fine here.

242
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,079
Mother is taking care of me,

243
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,208
and I'm receiving treatments.

244
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,176
During the process,

245
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,224
I have a deep experience.

246
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,226
I knew that...

247
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,165
Real love can't

248
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,133
be waited!

249
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,190
I thought of brother and

250
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,136
sister-in-law
during this time.

251
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,161
They have gone through

252
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,199
a lot of difficulties together.

253
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,212
No matter what happen,

254
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:58,044
you will face it together

255
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,175
without any hesitation.

256
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,186
Even you know that

257
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:06,213
Uncle Du will not accept you,

258
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,225
but you still insisted

259
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:11,218
and walk down the red carpet.

260
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,223
You don't want to wait,

261
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,236
because you believe in

262
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,172
each other's love.

263
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,174
You have persistence

264
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,200
in your family

265
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:29,213
and to your marriage.

266
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:33,047
I believe that you will

267
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:36,178
be fine in the future,

268
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,155
and live happily.

269
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,180
I will be happy as well.

270
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,057
Brother and Cai-Jie,

271
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,188
you do not need to wait.

272
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:51,191
Today is the happy ending for you.

273
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,173
I sincerely give my blessing.

274
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,085
Under the witness of God...

275
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,182
What is there to witness?

276
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,187
It's useless even if my daughter's

277
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,064
wedding is witnessed by God.

278
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,128
Du Li-De, what are you doing?

279
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,197
Don't try to mess things up.

280
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,175
This is my daughter's wedding.

281
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,232
What are you saying?

282
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,178
Let me through!

283
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,153
Father.

284
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,214
You, go down.

285
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,218
Everyone...

286
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,232
God wants to witness my daughter's

287
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,200
wedding with eyes but

288
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,224
not with any talking.

289
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,204
Others can hand to me.

290
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:04,207
Father, what are you trying to do?

291
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,209
What do you mean?

292
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,177
You can stop talking.

293
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,201
Zheng Ya-Lun,

294
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,182
please reply me properly.

295
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:13,205
Are you willing to

296
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:16,219
love Cai-Jie for the rest of

297
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:19,222
your life and listen to

298
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:23,159
what she says in the future?

299
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,130
Yes, I do.

300
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,292
Are you willing to let

301
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,233
her be happy until she

302
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,202
will never leave you,

303
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:37,197
and stay with you all the time?

304
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:40,142
Yes, I do.

305
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,304
Are you willing to let

306
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,281
her be prettier than

307
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,250
your female customers?

308
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,218
Cai-Jie is the prettiest

309
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,210
girl in my eyes.

310
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,223
So, yes I do.

311
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:56,192
Father, that's enough!

312
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,159
No, not enough.

313
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,129
One more important thing...

314
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,167
Little Curly, let me ask you.

315
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,327
Are you willing to

316
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,162
be a good brother

317
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,227
when the baby is born,

318
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,140
to love him and take care of him,

319
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,165
but not to fight with him,

320
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,166
or take his toys away?

321
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,234
Are you willing to?

322
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,180
Yes, I do.

323
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,182
Great!

324
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,185
So now,

325
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,221
under the witness

326
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,313
of God and me,

327
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,115
I announce that

328
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,181
Zheng Ya-Lun
and Du Cai-Jie

329
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,218
are officially husband and wife.

330
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,159
Cai-Jie, put on

331
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:43,173
the ring for your husband.

332
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,157
Cai-Jie...

333
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,209
Be careful.

334
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,156
Where is my baby?

335
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,215
Don't worry, you are fine now.

336
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:38,194
The baby is safe now

337
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,164
and very healthy.

338
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,191
Although it's premature birth,

339
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,170
but baby is fine,

340
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,138
and he's a boy.

341
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,162
He's sleeping comfortably

342
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,197
in the cooler now.

343
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,210
Most importantly he's healthy.

344
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,179
He's healthy like you.

345
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:59,182
Thank God!

346
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,184
We've been worried for so long,

347
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,084
now everything is fine.

348
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,248
Ya-Lun, do you know that

349
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,191
I'm so afraid when

350
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,057
I fainted at that time.

351
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,188
God knows you are a good

352
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,199
mother so He didn't let you suffer.

353
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,226
Cai-Jie, let me tell you.

354
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,170
My grandson is as

355
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,297
handsome as I am.

356
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,131
Who said that?

357
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,200
He has our family Qin's genetic.

358
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,200
It's the same.

359
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,214
Like father like son.

360
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,150
I have a handsome and

361
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:37,244
healthy great grandson now.

362
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,316
Ya-Lun, if your mom

363
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,122
and aunt Min-Hui knows,

364
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,220
they would be happy.

365
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,202
Ai-Jia.

366
00:19:58,196 --> 00:19:59,334
I want to give

367
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,136
all my luck to you

368
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,202
and Zhong-Qi.

369
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,215
I believe, he

370
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,081
will be back soon.

371
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,178
So you must promise

372
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,156
me that you will be happy.

373
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,146
I will.

374
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,194
I know that I will.

375
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,155
Where is my ring?

376
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,166
Your ring? Here!

377
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,191
You brought along your ring.

378
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,205
It's here.

379
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,299
Did you help me wear the

380
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,140
ring during the ceremony?

381
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,144
No.

382
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,170
Then wear it now.

383
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,204
Wait, are you willing

384
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,218
to marry me?

385
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,220
Yes, I do.

386
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,051
My dear daughter,

387
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,249
I've never seen a

388
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,155
girl so nervous.

389
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,182
Why are you like that?

390
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,217
But I heard you can talk

391
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,231
properly, it means you are well now.

392
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,166
Okay, please repeat for me.

393
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,226
Yes, I do.

394
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,228
Here I come.

395
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,233
I want to eat you up.

396
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:10,213
Why? Why do you want to eat me?

397
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,250
You never came back to visit me,

398
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:16,252
and never concern about me.

399
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:17,277
I'm sorry.

400
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:45,078
Everything is fine here.

401
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,141
Please do not worry.

402
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,243
But Zhong-Qi's eyes

403
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:52,221
have no further improvement,

404
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,247
he needs more time for treatment.

405
00:21:57,182 --> 00:22:00,254
April 15th, 2013.

406
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:07,260
Zhong-Qi's condition did not change,

407
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,238
so I've decided to

408
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,241
change a doctor to

409
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,243
treat Zhong-Qi.

410
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,233
Please do not worry,

411
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,247
I will not give up.

412
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:23,242
May 20th, 2013.

413
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:31,193
Although I don't want to say this,

414
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:34,060
and I don't want this result,

415
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,191
but there's no improvement

416
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:40,067
in Zhong-Qi's eyes. I

417
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:43,232
hope you are prepared.

418
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:47,209
July 10th, 2013.

419
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:54,250
Ai-Jia, why are you crying?

420
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,252
Min-Hui sent a letter

421
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,220
saying she brought Zhong-Qi

422
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:01,087
to see few doctors.

423
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,320
Doctors said that his

424
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,261
eyes will not get well.

425
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:10,062
Min-Hui have decided to

426
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,193
bring Zhong-Qi back.

427
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:20,265
At least Zhong-Qi is coming back.

428
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:29,218
Ai-Jia, grandma feels hurt

429
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:32,211
seeing you waiting

430
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,248
for him for so long...

431
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:40,229
But you are still young.

432
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,219
You still have such

433
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,257
long life.

434
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:48,227
I don't want to say this,

435
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,208
but for your own good...

436
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:57,111
I'm thinking if you want

437
00:23:57,135 --> 00:24:00,275
to leave Zhong-Qi now...

438
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,248
Ai-Jia.

439
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,248
Come here.

440
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,195
You are a good girl.

441
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:18,190
She's right.

442
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:21,102
For the sake of you,

443
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:23,232
I hope you can go

444
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:27,209
search for your happiness.

445
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:39,084
Like father like daughter.

446
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,021
Father is just like you,

447
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,286
I've been waiting for your

448
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,124
mother for so many years,

449
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,255
we only meet in dreams.

450
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:51,199
Did mother say anything to you?

451
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,100
She scolded me.

452
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:56,162
She scolded that we

453
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,199
are too stubborn.

454
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:07,249
But it will be a tough path.

455
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:14,121
No, it's not tough at all.

456
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:19,221
I'm happy to love him.

457
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,217
The plane is here,

458
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,186
they will be here anytime.

459
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,085
Why are you so nervous?

460
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,281
He should be nervous.

461
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,226
We knew the result,

462
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,228
am I right?

463
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,219
Zhong-Qi.

464
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,253
Zhong-Qi...

465
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,199
Ai-Jia came to pick you.

466
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:06,258
Walk this way...

467
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,272
Zhong-Qi...

468
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:11,241
Min-Hui,
Qi-Hong

469
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,208
Zhong-Qi,
Ming-Yu.

470
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:16,177
Mommy, Zhong-Qi...

471
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,236
Let's talk over there.

472
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,269
We will meet in front.

473
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,281
Okay.

474
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,280
Zhong-Qi.

475
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,193
Are you okay?

476
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:36,061
Min-Hui.

477
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,191
Qi-Hong.

478
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,293
You are finally back.

479
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:41,260
Ming-Yu, mother.

480
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,270
Zhong-Qi,

481
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,204
do you miss me?

482
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:45,174
Yes.

483
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,176
Are you okay?

484
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:52,179
Brother.

485
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:58,278
Zhong-Qi, here.

486
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:05,251
Ai-Jia has been waiting for you.

487
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,222
Ai-Jia.

488
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:15,067
Zhong-Qi,

489
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,232
I miss you.

490
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,178
Ai-Jia,

491
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,270
but he can't see now.

492
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,228
Mommy.

493
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:51,239
Let's go.

494
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,242
Grandma is waiting at home.

495
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,277
Okay, let's go home.

496
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:25,037
From today onwards,

497
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,202
you don't need this.

498
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:30,179
I am your eyes.

499
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,271
Let's go.

500
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,218
Have a seat.

501
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:41,189
Son, are you tired?

502
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:43,089
Did you sleep?

503
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,252
Yes, grandma.

504
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,229
How's everyone?

505
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:50,233
It's been a long time.

506
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:53,202
Aunt, everyone is fine.

507
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:55,226
Mrs. Qin.

508
00:29:56,261 --> 00:30:00,232
This year Ai-Jia took care of

509
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:03,212
Chairman and grandma.

510
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,180
Ai-Jia.

511
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:07,080
Since we are back,

512
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,108
you should be doing

513
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,211
what you should do.

514
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,222
Aunt,Ai-Jia she...

515
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,087
Mrs Qin, before I

516
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,217
went out today,

517
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,194
I've cleaned the house,

518
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,184
and I've prepared

519
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,251
the dishes for you.

520
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,231
Yes, Min-Hui.

521
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,199
Now everything includes

522
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,168
eat, drink, use and all

523
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:28,034
the housework is

524
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,265
done by Ai-Jia.

525
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,171
She did a good job,

526
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,231
what more do you want her to do?

527
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,177
Since I touched down

528
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,180
until now, she never called me.

529
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:39,182
Why did she call me Mrs. Qin?

530
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,184
Mrs. Qin...

531
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:44,243
Ai-Jia, who am I to you?

532
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,224
Yes.

533
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,226
Yes.

534
00:30:50,214 --> 00:30:52,160
Ai-Jia.

535
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,184
You this little girl.

536
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:56,062
You are one of our family now,

537
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,192
you should change the title.

538
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,135
The wedding last year went half

539
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:04,173
and the most important part didn't finish.

540
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,175
You must give tea to

541
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,201
your father-in-law
and mother-in-law.

542
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,214
Yes, tea.

543
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,149
Let me prepare.

544
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,214
Grandma.

545
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,215
Please drink tea.

546
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,229
Okay.

547
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:34,100
This year everyone sees

548
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,264
your effort and what you've

549
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,241
done to family Qin.

550
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:41,073
I'm so happy.

551
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,136
I'm so happy.

552
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,204
Thank you.

553
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,184
Father.

554
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:49,207
Please drink tea.

555
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,220
Okay.

556
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:01,060
I'm happy like

557
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,291
your grandma.

558
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,231
You are our

559
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,235
daughter-in-law
now.

560
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,238
I'm happy to drink this cup of tea.

561
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:10,228
I'm really very happy.

562
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,241
Thank you.

563
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,213
Mother.

564
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,205
Please drink tea.

565
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,220
Actually I brought Zhong-Qi

566
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:28,213
overseas for treatment

567
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:31,090
because Zhong-Qi doesn't

568
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,187
want you to suffer and

569
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,219
wait for him.

570
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:38,097
Zhong-Qi hopes that

571
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,194
you can forget him.

572
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,263
Previously I said

573
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,071
that I want to test you.

574
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,168
But I didn't expect the

575
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:52,204
test from God is even worse.

576
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:54,216
To test Zhong-Qi,

577
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,218
and to test you.

578
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,221
Although he's overseas,

579
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:02,224
but he misses you

580
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:03,248
everyday and every night.

581
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,227
No matter what I say

582
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:07,263
or what I told him,

583
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:10,095
he kept saying that he's wrong.

584
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,294
He should not let you stay.

585
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,202
Because he believe in your

586
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,195
love towards him.

587
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,230
So I told him...

588
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:22,176
If...

589
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,204
you are still here

590
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:28,207
when we come back,

591
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:31,220
waiting for him,

592
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:35,190
I will give my blessing.

593
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:40,196
Frankly speaking,

594
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:43,199
when I saw you,

595
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:46,168
I was touched.

596
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,171
That moment, I've decided

597
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,174
to give my blessings to you.

598
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:55,210
So...

599
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:58,180
Ai-Jia...

600
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:01,216
You passed the test!

601
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,193
Mom is happy that

602
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,196
the one beside

603
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:17,199
Zhong-Qi is still you.

604
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,236
You are truly qualified

605
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:24,195
to be Zhong-Qi's

606
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,209
wife now.

607
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,213
Thank you.

608
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,197
Here, Zhong-Qi.

609
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:59,175
Ai-Jia.

610
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:14,190
From today onwards,

611
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,185
please take care of Zhong-Qi.

612
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:24,165
Mom believe that you

613
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:28,159
can take care better than I do.

614
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,177
Ai-Jia.

615
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,206
Thank you.

616
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:45,152
I'm sorry.

617
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,281
Why did you apologize?

618
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:52,056
As long as you come back,

619
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,188
everything is worth it now.

620
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:17,218
Ai-Jia, bring your husband here.

621
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,211
Father, what do you want to do?

622
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:23,088
Why don't I have tea?

623
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,185
Okay, leave this.

624
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,220
He didn't come to my house,

625
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:31,200
and didn't accompany Ai-Jia.

626
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,224
Say goodbye.

627
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:37,228
This is what he should do.

628
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:39,207
Okay.

629
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,168
Here, you can kneel down.

630
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:47,216
Be careful.

631
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,241
Okay, forget about it.

632
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,254
The most important thing is

633
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:55,190
you ran after the

634
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:58,216
first night of wedding.

635
00:36:58,215 --> 00:37:00,217
I will not repeat it.

636
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,231
Is there any next time?

637
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,233
My temper has gone up.

638
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:06,201
I'll hit you.

639
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,204
Shi-Hao.

640
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,240
I scared him. He can't see it!

641
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:13,198
You are...

642
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:16,245
Okay, please take good

643
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:19,180
care of my daughter. OK?

644
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,188
Be careful.

645
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:14,193
It's not convenient to
go out during rainy days.

646
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,194
No, I'm looking at the cloud,

647
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,208
it's going to be sunny day.

648
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,177
You've been at home for so long,

649
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,179
I want to bring you out.

650
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:35,088
The best part of automatic transmission

651
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:38,218
car is to be able to hold your hands.

652
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:39,216
Okay, let's go.

653
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:58,235
We're here.

654
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:01,183
Be careful.

655
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,242
Why did you want to come to seaside?

656
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:07,221
Because seaside meant

657
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,191
a lot to us.

658
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,159
Yes.

659
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,184
We built our relationship here.

660
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:15,197
Be careful. -I was being pushed

661
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,199
off when I first met you.

662
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,190
Be careful.

663
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,070
Is that He Zhong-Qi

664
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:27,132
with spectacles?

665
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,199
What are you doing?

666
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,233
Take him away!

667
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,181
Ai-Jia...

668
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,238
Ai-Jia, be careful.

669
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,206
Ai-Jia.

670
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,209
Ai-Jia.

671
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:46,161
Ai-Jia,

672
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,195
are you okay?

673
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:50,188
Don't take my husband!

674
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:54,167
Ai-Jia...

675
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:56,193
Ai-Jia,

676
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:57,171
Fun!

677
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:00,231
Yes.

678
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,179
Min-Hui,

679
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,205
what is wrong? Why are you laughing?

680
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,148
Yes.

681
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:09,173
You've been acting strange

682
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:10,207
since you came back.

683
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:14,246
I'm fine. I'm really fine.

684
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,252
She's been smiling since

685
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:21,263
she came back.

686
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,198
You must be careful.

687
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,200
Nonsense!

688
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:26,223
What are you saying?

689
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:30,171
Come, I'll carry you.

690
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,172
Quick, Ai-Jia.

691
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:33,175
You can't carry me. -Let me carry you.

692
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,199
How will you see the road?

693
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,236
You will be my eyes.

694
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,179
Okay.

695
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,182
Straight. Quick!

696
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,047
Let's go.

697
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:42,278
I'm going.

698
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,183
Be careful.

699
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,176
Every time you carry me.

700
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,187
Let me carry you this time.

701
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,188
Okay, stop talking.

702
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,189
Let's go.

703
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,021
In front,

704
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,150
go straight.

705
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:52,160
This smells good.

706
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:53,253
Honey, you changed your shampoo.

707
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,230
You asked me not to joke,

708
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:57,232
but you are playing now.

709
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,167
Honestly, your hair color

710
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,168
now looks better.

711
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,193
They are coming, quick!

712
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:03,227
Okay!

713
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,069
Quick!

714
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:06,166
Shit!

715
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,200
Be careful!

716
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,178
I can see them.

717
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,148
Stop!

718
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:20,188
You can see them?

719
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:26,159
So you can see?

720
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:26,217
I...

721
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,126
You can see all the while?

722
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:29,188
No, it's not all the while.

723
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:30,221
I just managed to see just now.

724
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,165
I... Actually I...

725
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:33,259
Why did you lie to me?

726
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:36,170
I came back once my eyes get well.

727
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:38,195
I wanted to surprise you.

728
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,209
I was just joking, honey.

729
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,182
Please don't be angry.

730
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:48,182
Honey...

731
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,221
Don't move.

732
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,067
You are so brave. -Father...

733
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,129
You pretend to be blind

734
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,230
to lie to me and Ai-Jia.

735
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,173
Father, I didn't do it purposely.

736
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:13,231
No...

737
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,107
Do you know how her days were?

738
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,169
Worried, scared, disappointed...

739
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,201
Hope and disappointed again...

740
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,214
I need to teach him a lesson. -Enough!

741
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:21,182
Have you had enough?

742
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,185
Zhong-Qi apologized to me

743
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,242
and I pushed him into the sea?

744
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,222
What? Why did you do that?

745
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,224
Mother.

746
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,055
Relax.

747
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:32,185
I'm fine.

748
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:33,217
It's really my fault.

749
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,196
Okay.

750
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,220
Let me warn you,

751
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:38,096
if next year, you haven’t

752
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:40,159
give your grandmother, your

753
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,159
parents and me a grandson,

754
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,194
I'm going to blind you.

755
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,208
Okay, I will work hard.

756
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:48,209
He can't do it if you continue.

757
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,267
Okay, thank you everyone.

758
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,177
Let's go.

759
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,203
Remember to lock the door. -Shut up!

760
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,220
Here, sit down.

761
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,212
Did you hear...

762
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:06,057
Wait, you haven't tell me,

763
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,292
why did you lie to me?

764
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,301
I did remind you just now,

765
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:15,236
and I hope that both of

766
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,206
our life is full of surprises.

767
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:20,175
Secondly, I missed

768
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,166
the time when we first met

769
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:25,043
and the scene as well.

770
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,174
Most importantly we

771
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:28,309
have the same memories now

772
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,177
as our basic and stem

773
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:32,187
over a new life.

774
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:34,211
But I regretted when

775
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:36,191
I was being kicked

776
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:38,215
off into the sea.

777
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:40,228
If I found out that

778
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,230
I loved you, you

779
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:44,254
don't need to suffer.

780
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:01,216
Help! The wolf is coming!

781
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:04,219
I'm the big wolf, I want to eat you.

782
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:07,222
I want to eat little Red Riding Hood.

783
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:09,157
No!

784
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,214
Don't stop!

785
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:12,090
I want to be eaten.

786
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,187
I want to be with

787
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:16,221
the wolf forever.

788
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:20,224
Wait a minute...

789
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:23,227
Did you hear...

790
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,240
Did you hear anything?

791
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:27,174
What sound?

792
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,199
The true wolf is here!
