1
00:00:32,997 --> 00:00:35,602
We've watched her
for the last 2 weeks.

2
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:39,515
4 days ago, she signed up
for a Hong Kong tour to Ukraine.

3
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:43,013
Yesterday she went to the Swiss Bank.

4
00:00:43,187 --> 00:00:46,645
I believe she withdrew a big load of cash.

5
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,317
<i>She's an Ukrainian passport holder.</i>

6
00:00:51,404 --> 00:00:59,698
Her name is Natasha Rekshynski.

7
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:00,776
(Uncle Bill)
<i>It's all in the file.</i>

8
00:01:00,997 --> 00:01:02,191
She's a Ukrainian.

9
00:01:02,332 --> 00:01:06,041
and she has to join a Hong Kong tour
to go back to Ukraine?

10
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:12,053
- OK. Thank you, Jackie. Well done.
- Thank you.

11
00:01:12,053 --> 00:01:14,044
Bill, I'd like to talk with you a minute.

12
00:01:14,096 --> 00:01:15,218
Me?

13
00:01:16,384 --> 00:01:18,170
- OK
- Excuse me.

14
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:28,441
Natasha Rekshyn... difficult name!

15
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:33,702
13 pounds of weapons grade uranium 235
was uncovered at the New York Airport.

16
00:01:33,702 --> 00:01:35,323
2 suspects were arrested,

17
00:01:35,323 --> 00:01:38,021
both buyers carrying 2 million in cash.

18
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:39,340
The seller walked.

19
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,205
Natasha is our only lead.

20
00:01:41,342 --> 00:01:46,427
Jackie, the C. I. A. guy
said you did great work.

21
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,379
Try to get out more in future.

22
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,089
Got to have the chance first.

23
00:01:50,226 --> 00:01:55,471
You've got it. Vacation on the Black Sea.
Ticket and accommodation provided.

24
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,303
Uncle Bill, is the case still in our hands?

25
00:01:58,303 --> 00:01:59,851
Yes, and they want you especially.

26
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:03,093
CIA has lots of men outside Hong Kong.
I don't think I can be helpful.

27
00:02:03,313 --> 00:02:06,897
They suspect that there's a rat, that's
why they want help from outside.

28
00:02:07,108 --> 00:02:09,520
I don't speak Russian and
I can't help there.

29
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:10,729
You don't have to speak Russian.

30
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:13,232
All you have to do is follow
this girl to Russia

31
00:02:13,365 --> 00:02:14,525
and they'll take over from there.

32
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,781
You'll spend two nights there and come back

33
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:18,870
So I just watch her
on the plane?

34
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,407
Exactly. What can she do on a plane?

35
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:22,953
That simple?

36
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:24,996
That simple.

37
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:28,434
I'd go myself if I could.

38
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:31,744
So this is by your own will, OK?

39
00:02:31,976 --> 00:02:35,184
Just one more thing. Don't forget
to buy me a nice bottle of vodka.

40
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:38,479
and some really good caviar.

41
00:02:38,862 --> 00:02:39,647
Yes, sir.

42
00:02:39,647 --> 00:02:41,942
I already signed you up
for a tour to Ukraine.

43
00:03:27,654 --> 00:03:30,100
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

44
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:36,735
I'm sorry, sir, your
passport is expired.

45
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:37,957
Huh?!

46
00:03:37,957 --> 00:03:39,268
Follow me, please.

47
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,745
(Jackie in Cantonese)
She says my passport expired!

47
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:45,961
(tour guide in Russian)
What's wrong here?

48
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:47,622
His passport is expired.

49
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:48,826
Can I come with him?

50
00:03:48,964 --> 00:03:49,953
No.

51
00:03:50,215 --> 00:03:52,501
Don't worry. Worst thing you just go back.

52
00:03:52,717 --> 00:03:53,752
It's OK.

53
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:57,957
<i>No problem. Someone's working on it.</i>

54
00:04:00,237 --> 00:04:02,148
Jackie, welcome to the Ukraine.

55
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:05,576
Mark, she scared the hell out of me.

56
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:07,786
This is Commander Korda,
Department of Security.

57
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,359
Nice to meet you.

58
00:04:09,454 --> 00:04:10,273
Did you find anything?

59
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,239
No, but she went to the toilet 7 times.

60
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:14,918
Here's the timetable.

61
00:04:14,918 --> 00:04:17,284
She didn't talk to anyone.

62
00:04:17,686 --> 00:04:18,630
Thanks, Jackie.

63
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,793
You're done. We'll take over from here.

64
00:04:22,032 --> 00:04:23,568
Very good!

65
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:25,445
$1,000.

66
00:04:25,578 --> 00:04:27,068
Any other currency?

67
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:28,747
No.

68
00:04:28,747 --> 00:04:32,410
Your accommodation is fixed,
your flight is booked for tomorrow,

69
00:04:32,585 --> 00:04:34,701
Here's some pocket money, one billion.

70
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,830
One billion?

71
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:39,751
A telephone. Dial 0-1
if you need us. Simple, huh?

72
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:40,877
Yeah, pretty simple.

73
00:04:41,056 --> 00:04:42,874
Marina will show you to your car.

74
00:04:43,212 --> 00:04:44,393
Oh, yes.

75
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:45,574
Have fun!

76
00:04:52,407 --> 00:04:53,808
<i>Thank you.</i>

77
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:58,437
Thank you.

78
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,491
Have a good holiday.

79
00:04:59,513 --> 00:04:59,990
Thank you

80
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:09,459
Line two.

81
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:20,103
Hello

82
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:23,359
Hello. It's Natasha.

83
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,642
Wrong number!

84
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:29,054
Hello? Hello?

85
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:33,415
Let's go.

86
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,452
I'm sorry because his
passport has expired

87
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:44,580
Mr. Chan has to take the next
flight back to Hong Kong.

88
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:46,286
Oh, really? That's a pity!

89
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:47,951
Then we just go ahead.

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,068
Everyone, please get on the bus

91
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:05,348
(tour guide)
<i>We'll spend 15 minutes here.</i>

92
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:07,516
<i>We'll check in the hotel in an hour.
Take as many pictures as you like.</i>

93
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:09,821
- OK
- OK great.

94
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:22,683
We're watching her.

95
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:25,648
No one has made contact with her yet.

96
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:42,495
Take her away!

97
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:43,958
She's a member of our tour.

98
00:06:44,178 --> 00:06:46,294
We have to take her in for questioning.

99
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:48,542
Department of Security.

100
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,637
Sorry. It's an order,
we have to take her away.

101
00:06:56,524 --> 00:06:59,687
What? Who's the commander?

102
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:02,332
Natasha was taken away by the Strike Force.

103
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:03,219
What?

104
00:07:03,874 --> 00:07:05,159
Two for 5 million?

105
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:07,150
<i>Yes, it's very good caviar.</i>

106
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:09,685
(in Cantonese)
How much is 5 million?

107
00:07:19,852 --> 00:07:20,352
(vendor)
Hey!

108
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:23,628
OK

109
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:25,551
- Hey, follow the car. Follow the car!
- OK

110
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:26,741
Quick quick quick!

111
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:53,373
I go and look. You wait.

112
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:56,312
OK?

113
00:07:56,812 --> 00:07:57,608
OK.

114
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,179
(Jackie)
<i>Mark, I saw Natasha.
What happened?</i>

115
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:04,171
What? Natasha? Where?

116
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,398
She went into a church.

117
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:10,431
Jackie just said he saw
Natasha went inside a church.

118
00:09:10,696 --> 00:09:13,733
There are about 30 churches
around. Which one?

119
00:09:13,949 --> 00:09:15,735
What's the name of the street?

120
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,071
Too foggy. I can't see.

121
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:20,608
Keep following her.
Don't let them see you.

122
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,975
Try to get a street name and call us.

123
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:23,985
OK, I try.

124
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:35,380
(man)
<i>It's Tsui.</i>

125
00:09:35,686 --> 00:09:38,069
<i>Natasha was followed by
the Ukrainian secret police.</i>

126
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:39,607
<i>but I got rid of them.</i>

127
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:41,496
<i>You better check what's going on.</i>

128
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:44,705
<i>I want a safer place to deliver the goods.</i>

129
00:09:45,913 --> 00:09:48,154
<i>Yes, I'll be there on time.</i>

130
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:56,618
Major Majenko!

131
00:09:56,873 --> 00:09:57,908
Mr. Tsui!

132
00:09:57,908 --> 00:09:59,669
Long time no see.

133
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,837
Thank you for sending your men.

134
00:10:01,837 --> 00:10:04,579
Your problem is my problem.

135
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,253
And I got your stuff here.

136
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,061
(Tsui)
<i>This is just for the boys.</i>

137
00:10:17,061 --> 00:10:20,599
This is your new passport
with an American Visa.

138
00:10:20,648 --> 00:10:23,264
Your money is already
in your Swiss bank account.

139
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:25,270
(in Russian)
Very good.

140
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,799
Take the shell apart,
separate into 6 boxes

141
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,085
and then send them
to these addresses.

142
00:10:30,442 --> 00:10:33,605
I'll take the guidance system
and the uranium core with me.

143
00:10:33,605 --> 00:10:35,853
(Major Majenko in Russian)
<i>Good! It shall be done!</i>

144
00:11:21,776 --> 00:11:23,357
(Tsui in Russian)
<i>Check the funds.</i>

145
00:11:23,357 --> 00:11:24,860
I'll call you later.

146
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,645
(Natasha)
<i>Be careful.</i>

147
00:11:26,043 --> 00:11:26,737
(Tsui in English)
I love you.

148
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:28,557
I love you too.

149
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:10,837
It's Jackie.

150
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:12,622
What's wrong with your phone?

151
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:15,466
I shut it off. I found a new suspect.

152
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:16,392
(Mark)
<i>Who is it?</i>

153
00:12:16,392 --> 00:12:18,178
I don't know.

154
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:19,228
(Mark)
<i>Where are you?</i>

155
00:12:19,396 --> 00:12:20,491
Let me see.

156
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:29,819
I can't read the sign.

157
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:31,605
Looks like a ski resort area.

158
00:12:31,882 --> 00:12:33,387
Can you spell it out?

159
00:12:37,326 --> 00:12:40,648
"C–H–I–K–" no no no, left-right ''K''

160
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:43,105
Left and right ''K"

161
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:45,077
H–l–K–A–P–A–T–N... no, no reverse N

162
00:12:45,077 --> 00:12:48,077
P–A–T–N, no no, Reverse "N".

163
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:51,507
We got it! Good!

164
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:52,496
We're on our way!

165
00:12:56,612 --> 00:12:59,763
(in Russian)
Do you have anything
for Alexander Nevski?

166
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:19,049
(man)
Very tired, I find the first time
the snow is not so good for me.

167
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:26,328
(in Russian)
Can I help you?

168
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:28,792
– Huh?
– (in English): Can I help you?

169
00:13:29,304 --> 00:13:30,714
Ski or snowboard?

170
00:13:31,252 --> 00:13:31,967
Snowboard.

171
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:33,436
– First timer?
– Yes.

172
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:45,451
Receipt. Pay at counter.

173
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:46,383
Thank you.

174
00:13:50,985 --> 00:13:51,768
Hey!

175
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:52,995
Thank you

176
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:12,020
Hello, Natasha?

177
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,715
Is the money deposited?

178
00:14:13,715 --> 00:14:16,176
(in Russian)
<i>Yes, but it's a check.</i>

179
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:18,792
It will take 3 days to verify.

180
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:22,403
(in English)
OK, I'll call you again.

181
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,056
<i>Department of Security.
You're under arrest!</i>

182
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:33,233
Please buy a hat!

183
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:34,803
Money for the orphanage!

184
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:36,340
Mister, please buy a hat.

185
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,534
Huh? Oh, how much? How much?

186
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:39,373
40.

187
00:14:39,758 --> 00:14:41,019
Keep, keep the change.

188
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:54,264
Where can I get some clothes?

189
00:14:54,264 --> 00:14:56,099
(man in Russian)
<i>Where do you think I can get you clothes?</i>

190
00:14:56,099 --> 00:14:59,515
<i>Who'd have extra clothing
for you in this weather?</i>

191
00:14:59,515 --> 00:15:03,500
You know it's freezing out here
and still you wear so little.

192
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,346
<i>And now you bother others for clothes?</i>

193
00:15:05,346 --> 00:15:07,507
Thank you.

194
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:01,353
Hello?

195
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,269
<i>Hello, hello? Where are you?</i>

196
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:07,602
Suspect just passed
the restricted area sign.

197
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:09,536
Some kind of restricted area sign.

198
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,203
Don't worry. Go in!

199
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,642
Hey, keep moving. Go ahead!

200
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:14,728
No!

201
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,059
There's a picture!

202
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,534
Looks like if I pass, I'll get shot.

203
00:16:19,754 --> 00:16:21,369
Some kind of restricted area sign.

204
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:23,599
It's just for kids!

205
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:26,600
Just for kids! Go ahead.
Come on! Let's go!

206
00:17:34,707 --> 00:17:37,472
We've been expecting you.
How was your trip?

207
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:38,962
Very smooth.

208
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:49,150
Hello?

209
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:52,085
Where the hell are you?

210
00:17:52,085 --> 00:17:54,203
About 2 mile...

211
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:56,392
East, south, west...

212
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:58,984
west of the restricted area sign.

213
00:17:58,984 --> 00:18:01,882
2 miles west of
the restricted area sign.

214
00:18:02,278 --> 00:18:03,643
Hurry up. I'm freezing.

215
00:18:03,643 --> 00:18:05,219
Get some clothes.

216
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:07,766
Huh? OK, clothes.

217
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,178
You got everything here?

218
00:18:14,534 --> 00:18:16,195
I want to talk to your boss.

219
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:18,058
My boss is waiting.

220
00:18:57,779 --> 00:18:59,528
(in Russian)
There is someone out there!

221
00:18:59,528 --> 00:19:00,722
Who is it?

222
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,632
He looks like a Chinese.

223
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,261
Who did you bring with you?

224
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,505
Nobody.

225
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:32,466
Inside

226
00:19:34,123 --> 00:19:35,349
(Mark)
<i>Anyone else around?</i>

227
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:36,634
I didn't see anybody around.

228
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:39,797
Stay back. We will handle the rest.

229
00:19:40,683 --> 00:19:41,682
(in Russian)
<i>Around.</i>

230
00:19:43,146 --> 00:19:44,462
<i>Forward!</i>

231
00:19:50,215 --> 00:19:52,001
It's bloody freezing here!

232
00:19:57,506 --> 00:19:58,421
Nice hat!

233
00:19:58,421 --> 00:19:59,411
Are you OK?

234
00:20:00,688 --> 00:20:01,753
What do you think?

235
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:13,378
(in Russian)
<i>All units stand by.</i>

236
00:20:13,602 --> 00:20:15,809
<i>The enemy has entered the ring!</i>

237
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,577
(in English)
Give me the briefcase.

238
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:24,192
Don't move!

239
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,673
Back off!

240
00:20:33,813 --> 00:20:36,291
Tell your people not to open fire.

241
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,374
I have a detonator
wired to the uranium core.

242
00:20:39,594 --> 00:20:43,382
If it gets shot, the entire city
would be wiped out.

243
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:46,470
And you and I will be the nuclear history.

244
00:20:53,024 --> 00:20:54,659
(in English)
Freeze, don't move!

245
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,546
Hey, it's a trap!

246
00:21:45,265 --> 00:21:47,020
(Mark)
<i>Jackie, go get the skidoo!</i>

247
00:22:06,696 --> 00:22:08,474
<i>Don't shoot! Don't shoot!</i>

248
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:10,294
Grab the case! Grab it!

249
00:22:30,094 --> 00:22:31,087
Mark?

250
00:22:31,877 --> 00:22:32,623
Tsui!

251
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:34,366
It's you?!

252
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:49,679
Jackie, over here!

253
00:22:53,927 --> 00:22:56,339
Shoot it! Shoot the helicopter!

254
00:23:09,332 --> 00:23:10,180
Let's go!

255
00:23:31,976 --> 00:23:33,136
Mark!

256
00:23:33,136 --> 00:23:33,822
GO!

257
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,610
Don't move!

258
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,367
Go down and get the box!

259
00:30:09,801 --> 00:30:11,006
<i>Hello, Jackie</i>

260
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,874
Who are you?

261
00:30:14,882 --> 00:30:18,671
I'm Colonel Gregor Yegorov of
the Russian Federal Security Bureau.

262
00:30:18,988 --> 00:30:19,720
Huh?

263
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,463
<i>Well, FSB. for short,
the new, improved KGB.</i>

264
00:30:24,654 --> 00:30:25,519
KGB?

265
00:30:26,262 --> 00:30:27,518
Am I in Russia?

266
00:30:27,518 --> 00:30:28,565
(Gregor)
<i>Yes</i>

267
00:30:30,802 --> 00:30:31,831
Where's Mark?

268
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:33,113
He's still in coma.

269
00:30:34,002 --> 00:30:36,938
We connected the
Ukraine Department of Security.

270
00:30:36,938 --> 00:30:39,115
I know about your
operation with the CIA.

271
00:30:40,002 --> 00:30:42,742
<i>The FSB Generals
want to see you.</i>

272
00:30:44,148 --> 00:30:46,459
You are coming to
Moscow with me today.

273
00:30:47,077 --> 00:30:48,440
Can you help me?

274
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,589
Yes?

275
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,526
Turn off all those things.

276
00:30:52,461 --> 00:30:53,856
I'm very hot!

277
00:31:12,825 --> 00:31:14,656
(man in Russian)
<i>Compliant to the Start-I Treaty</i>

278
00:31:14,656 --> 00:31:16,942
<i>with the United States on December 1994,</i>

279
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:20,384
<i>both countries have reduced the
number of active nuclear warheads</i>

280
00:31:20,597 --> 00:31:24,966
<i>from 25,000 during the cold war to
around 10,000 on each side at present.</i>

281
00:31:25,142 --> 00:31:26,962
<i>In Ukraine, we have a crisis in our hands</i>

282
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:30,519
<i>because arms dealers are taking
advantage of Ukraine's late compliance with Start-I.</i>

283
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:32,642
<i>There are warheads with questionable
status are being smuggled out</i>

284
00:31:32,816 --> 00:31:36,183
<i>by high rank army officials
who have access.</i>

285
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:39,904
<i>We want you, Jackie,
to work with Colonel Yegorov</i>

286
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:43,475
<i>to find this stolen
Ukrainian warhead.</i>

287
00:31:43,475 --> 00:31:47,518
the General wants you to go investigating
the case with Colonel Igorov.

288
00:31:50,138 --> 00:31:52,249
I think I have to call my
superior in Hong Kong.

289
00:31:53,017 --> 00:31:54,509
(General in Russian)
<i>We already did.</i>

290
00:31:54,509 --> 00:31:56,450
This is a letter of authorization
from your superior in Hong Kong.

291
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,690
They've agreed to attach you
to our mission.

292
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,277
The General has...

293
00:31:58,277 --> 00:32:02,704
That's a letter of authorization
from your superior in Hong Kong.

294
00:32:15,321 --> 00:32:16,077
OK

295
00:32:18,484 --> 00:32:22,649
(Gregor)
<i>The warhead was stolen from the
Khmolnitsky's base in Ukraine.</i>

296
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,827
Major Majenko was arrested.

297
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:27,083
How many warheads does
each symbol stand for?

298
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,585
<i>Each symbol stands for
100 nuclear warheads.</i>

299
00:32:31,354 --> 00:32:35,498
And each warhead is at least
10 to 30 times the power of

300
00:32:35,498 --> 00:32:38,628
the one dropped into the Hiroshima.

301
00:32:42,222 --> 00:32:45,392
What if all the bombs
explode at the same time?

302
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:47,177
That would be the end
of the planet Earth.

303
00:32:47,913 --> 00:32:51,402
The total explosive power
of the world's warheads

304
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:55,239
equals 15 million tons of TNT.

305
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:57,517
The power to destroy 7 earths.

306
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,193
That is why our mission is so important.

307
00:33:00,193 --> 00:33:01,637
What do I have to do?

308
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:03,362
You have to find Tsui.

309
00:33:03,362 --> 00:33:07,491
<i>He graduated from MIT with a
master degree in nuclear physics.</i>

310
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,214
<i>Recruited by CIA, his job was to steal</i>

311
00:33:10,214 --> 00:33:13,547
<i>urainium-235 production strategies</i>

312
00:33:13,547 --> 00:33:15,445
<i>from the Soviet Union</i>.

313
00:33:15,445 --> 00:33:18,671
<i>He's been FSB's main target for years.</i>

314
00:33:20,178 --> 00:33:21,372
Where we going now?

315
00:33:22,177 --> 00:33:23,292
We're going down!

316
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,809
– To the submarine?
– <i>Yes</i>

317
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:29,315
(man in Russian)
<i>Prepare to submerge!</i>

318
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:31,986
<i>Sir</i>

319
00:33:31,986 --> 00:33:34,004
(in English)
We're heading to Australia now.

320
00:33:34,004 --> 00:33:37,337
There will be a fisherman's
boat taking us in

321
00:33:37,804 --> 00:33:39,999
Everything is already arranged for you.

322
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:41,894
Are we being smuggled in?

323
00:33:42,113 --> 00:33:44,980
No, I wouldn't use this term.

324
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,062
<i>We're just arriving quietly.</i>

325
00:33:51,336 --> 00:33:52,722
(Jackie in Cantonese)
<i>Uncle Bill, guess where I am?!</i>

326
00:33:52,722 --> 00:33:53,926
(Uncle Bill)
<i>What's going on?</i>

327
00:33:54,238 --> 00:33:57,878
Here I am talking with you
in front of a great sea view.

328
00:33:58,358 --> 00:34:00,885
I can't believe it.
I feel like a VIP working for the FSB.

329
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:04,042
This 8,000 sq. ft. president suite
of mine has got 2 stories.

330
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,061
And there's a swimming pool,
a sauna, a <i>Jacuzzi</i>

331
00:34:07,605 --> 00:34:10,599
Hold on. A koala has just come out!

332
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:14,072
What? A koala in the hotel room?

333
00:34:14,072 --> 00:34:15,937
You mean a toy?

334
00:34:15,937 --> 00:34:16,800
No it's not.

335
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,858
It's real!

336
00:34:18,858 --> 00:34:20,498
Say hello to Uncle Bill.

337
00:34:20,498 --> 00:34:21,487
He's so shy.

338
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:25,046
Hold on. Let me take it back to the room.

339
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:29,632
Good boy, come here.

340
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:33,221
– (Jackie in English): Yes?
– Excuse me, sir. Your tea is ready.

341
00:34:33,221 --> 00:34:34,579
Thank you very much.

342
00:34:35,195 --> 00:34:37,667
(in Cantonese)
So great! If I had known it,
I would have gone too.

343
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:39,366
(in English)
Go home. Go home. Go home.

344
00:34:46,259 --> 00:34:47,928
(in Cantonese)
It's the real thing. No kidding!

345
00:34:48,357 --> 00:34:52,307
Anything else? Yeah, a great
car, gold card, cash,

346
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:55,925
and all the clothing with designer labels.

347
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:58,643
Now I feel like James Bond

348
00:34:58,643 --> 00:34:59,818
except I don't have the gorgeous girls.

349
00:34:59,818 --> 00:35:04,608
Hey, if you are this lucky,
you've got to be real careful.

350
00:35:04,608 --> 00:35:06,228
I will. All right.

351
00:35:06,228 --> 00:35:08,069
OK OK, tata. Bye-bye.

352
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,957
Do you think he's been working
so hard that he's out of his mind?

353
00:35:14,414 --> 00:35:17,577
I don't think so. Maybe he
just doesn't want you to worry.

354
00:35:17,577 --> 00:35:19,062
He didn't sound like that.

355
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:22,495
Wow, all this underwear!

356
00:35:29,469 --> 00:35:33,508
You're so hot, you even appear on
the underwear. But how can I wear them?

357
00:35:34,863 --> 00:35:35,978
(in Russian)
Put all the parts together

358
00:35:36,174 --> 00:35:37,175
<i>Yes boss.</i>

359
00:35:46,285 --> 00:35:48,990
(Gregor in English)
<i>Could I speak to Mr. Omar Mohammed?</i>

360
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,664
<i>It's Gregor Yegorov.</i>

361
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:53,433
<i>Hi Omar, it's Gregor!</i>

362
00:35:53,743 --> 00:35:55,478
<i>I got the stuff you need here with me.</i>

363
00:35:56,831 --> 00:35:58,593
<i>My lawyer looked into the contract.

364
00:35:58,593 --> 00:36:00,740
<i>all the terms look good.</i>

365
00:36:00,974 --> 00:36:03,126
<i>You think we can close the deal in a week?</i>

366
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:06,677
We'll sail out to international
waters outside Indonesia.

367
00:36:08,023 --> 00:36:09,542
You bring a pen

368
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,665
and I'll bring vodka and caviar.

369
00:36:15,557 --> 00:36:16,896
Right, that's it.

370
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,434
<i>I'll talk you later.</i>

371
00:36:31,532 --> 00:36:33,495
(man)
Ah, that's insane!

372
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:35,534
- Hi
- Hello

373
00:36:35,618 --> 00:36:36,466
– One adult?
– Yes?

374
00:36:36,466 --> 00:36:37,751
$15.50, please.

375
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:39,952
Excuse me. I'm looking for Annie Tsui.

376
00:36:39,952 --> 00:36:42,659
Annie? Uh, she's in a show right now.

377
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:44,908
Can I see her?

378
00:36:44,908 --> 00:36:45,419
Yes

379
00:36:47,922 --> 00:36:51,210
Michelle, he's looking for Annie.
Can you take him down, please?

380
00:36:51,426 --> 00:36:53,166
– Sure, nice flowers.
– Thank you.

381
00:36:54,219 --> 00:36:57,141
<i>In case you're in and out. Here's
your change. Enjoy your visit. </i> 

382
00:36:57,141 --> 00:36:58,551
Thank you.

383
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,877
– Hi
– Two adults please.

384
00:36:59,877 --> 00:37:00,504
2 adults?

385
00:37:04,164 --> 00:37:05,930
Annie, you want to have dinner tonight?

386
00:37:06,149 --> 00:37:07,624
Uh, I'm busy.

387
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:13,163
Hi!

388
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:18,214
So Peter asked you out again, huh?

389
00:37:18,214 --> 00:37:19,726
Oh, once everyday.

390
00:37:19,726 --> 00:37:21,717
– You're gonna go?
– No. Can you help me?

391
00:37:21,717 --> 00:37:22,839
Sure.

392
00:37:29,211 --> 00:37:30,624
(man)
Aw, look at that one over...

393
00:37:45,815 --> 00:37:48,270
There's Annie. Why don't you take a seat and I'll bring her down after the show.

394
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,327
Thank you

395
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:10,241
Thanks, Michelle

396
00:38:10,464 --> 00:38:11,596
Thank you

397
00:38:11,596 --> 00:38:13,006
Hi, uh, are you looking for me?

398
00:38:13,006 --> 00:38:15,138
Yes, my name's Jackie.
Do you speak Mandarin?

399
00:38:15,138 --> 00:38:16,524
(in Mandarin)
Oh, of course.

400
00:38:16,524 --> 00:38:18,225
Joe, can you give me ice water?

401
00:38:18,225 --> 00:38:19,635
– Sure
– Thanks.

402
00:38:23,184 --> 00:38:24,998
Your brother and I
are sworn brothers.

403
00:38:24,998 --> 00:38:26,381
He came back?

404
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,267
He did? Actually, I don't know.

405
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:31,097
He told me
you are working here.

406
00:38:31,277 --> 00:38:33,097
I'm here on vacation, so
I came to see you.

407
00:38:33,097 --> 00:38:35,002
Thanks. Did you need
anything from me?

408
00:38:35,906 --> 00:38:36,634
Nothing.

409
00:38:37,812 --> 00:38:39,327
He said that you love this kind of flower.

410
00:38:39,327 --> 00:38:40,880
So I bought some for you.

411
00:38:41,464 --> 00:38:43,774
He hasn't seen me for so long

412
00:38:43,774 --> 00:38:46,015
He even forgot what
kind of fowers I like.

413
00:38:46,264 --> 00:38:49,097
He didn't even return when
Dad went to the hospital.

414
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:51,720
(in English)
– Thanks
– No worries

415
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,503
Isn't your job dangerous?

416
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,259
No, not really. Sharks only go crazy
when they smell blood.

417
00:39:00,503 --> 00:39:03,210
When they see anything that
moves, that's when they bite.

418
00:39:03,381 --> 00:39:06,168
As long as you don't move,
nothing will happen to you.

419
00:39:06,384 --> 00:39:08,596
But there's always danger involved.

420
00:39:09,594 --> 00:39:12,256
So the next time I run into a shark,

421
00:39:12,472 --> 00:39:14,713
I'll act like a rock or a coral
and I will not move.

422
00:39:14,891 --> 00:39:17,883
Oh, sorry. I have to visit dad in the hospital.

423
00:39:17,883 --> 00:39:20,625
If there's nothing else, I'll be going.

424
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:22,972
– Thanks for the flowers.
– Thank you.

425
00:39:22,972 --> 00:39:23,792
(in English)
– Karen
– Yes?

426
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:25,712
– Put it on my bill.
– Sure, no problem.

427
00:39:25,712 --> 00:39:27,001
(in Mandarin)
– Thank you.
– Bye-bye

428
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:29,971
Annie

429
00:39:32,451 --> 00:39:34,037
Since I have never met
my sworn dad before,

430
00:39:34,037 --> 00:39:36,014
Can I go to hospital with you?

431
00:39:36,997 --> 00:39:41,411
All right. Why don't you wait for me
at the front gate? I'll be right there.

432
00:39:43,822 --> 00:39:44,983
What a lucky day!

433
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,413
I found his sister.

434
00:39:46,413 --> 00:39:48,188
I'm going to hospital with her right now.

435
00:39:48,188 --> 00:39:50,473
Very good. I'll meet you there.

436
00:39:51,516 --> 00:39:52,016
Hi.

437
00:39:53,097 --> 00:39:54,085
(woman)
<i>Annie</i>

438
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:55,914
Just a second.

439
00:39:55,914 --> 00:39:57,270
There's a box for you here.

440
00:39:58,803 --> 00:40:02,232
I'm going to the hospital, I will
pick it up later, OK? Bye. Bye.

441
00:40:04,927 --> 00:40:06,541
– Hello, Allen
– Hi.

442
00:40:07,251 --> 00:40:07,751
Hi.

443
00:40:07,945 --> 00:40:09,535
Dad, are you better today?

444
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:12,326
I've brought brother's
sworn brother to see you.

445
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:16,901
I've never met Tsui's sworn brother!
My name is Allen. Your name?

446
00:40:17,512 --> 00:40:19,027
– My name's Jackie.
– How do you do?

447
00:40:20,229 --> 00:40:21,716
<i>Let's go out for a while.</i>

448
00:40:21,716 --> 00:40:23,786
Please.

449
00:40:25,629 --> 00:40:26,922
What's wrong with your dad?

450
00:40:26,922 --> 00:40:30,509
Coronary embolism. He's having
an operation this afternoon.

451
00:40:30,509 --> 00:40:31,925
The doctor said it's
not looking good.

452
00:40:31,925 --> 00:40:33,209
Bugs receiving?

453
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:34,122
All operative.

454
00:40:36,565 --> 00:40:37,164
Daddy

455
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:41,881
Feeling better? Did the
doctor say anything?

456
00:40:42,052 --> 00:40:44,375
It's OK. Thanks.

457
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,840
How come my kid has
never talked about you?

458
00:40:50,613 --> 00:40:52,353
Actually, I'm not
sworn brother of Jackson Tsui.

459
00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:54,564
I'm with Hong Kong police.

460
00:40:54,867 --> 00:40:57,951
I'm investigating your older
son stealing nuclear weapon.

461
00:40:59,455 --> 00:41:01,275
Can I talk to you privately?

462
00:41:13,702 --> 00:41:15,112
What did he say?

463
00:41:15,357 --> 00:41:17,097
He said he's a policeman.

464
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,350
Do you know what your
son does for a living?

465
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,466
You're a cop, you should
know better than me.

466
00:41:24,695 --> 00:41:28,275
The Tsui family no longer has this son.

467
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:32,013
Could you please tell him
not to visit my grave?

468
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:37,542
Thank you.

469
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,656
I hope you get better soon.

470
00:41:56,236 --> 00:41:57,211
I'm sorry I lied to you.

471
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,125
Shh

472
00:42:08,757 --> 00:42:10,076
What happened?

473
00:42:10,076 --> 00:42:11,633
Looks like she's angry with Jackie.

474
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:13,304
You lied to me. Why
couldn't you lie to my dad?

475
00:42:13,304 --> 00:42:14,464
Let me explain.

476
00:42:14,464 --> 00:42:17,509
Are you trying to hurt him
more before he dies?

477
00:42:17,975 --> 00:42:22,146
Hands off! Listen, don't expect
me to tell you anything!

478
00:42:22,771 --> 00:42:23,430
I don't want to see you again.

479
00:42:23,646 --> 00:42:24,681
Enough!

480
00:42:24,899 --> 00:42:26,890
Please be quiet or leave the hospital!

481
00:42:29,018 --> 00:42:29,877
Please

482
00:42:37,058 --> 00:42:38,173
Annie, it's me.

483
00:42:42,285 --> 00:42:43,229
Brother

484
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:47,839
Where have you been all these years?

485
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,206
Why are you dressed like that?
What have you been doing out there?

486
00:42:51,668 --> 00:42:53,939
Do you know dad's
having surgery today?

487
00:42:54,413 --> 00:42:56,927
Yes, I know. I already spoke to him.

488
00:42:58,892 --> 00:42:59,947
Jackie

489
00:43:00,665 --> 00:43:01,799
Come in.

490
00:43:07,902 --> 00:43:10,359
That man out there works
for the new Russian Mafia.

491
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:13,692
He's not a policeman. You
must never believe this man.

492
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:16,568
Did you get anything from the old man?

493
00:43:17,071 --> 00:43:19,416
Uncle Seven is going
to surgery this afternoon.

494
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:20,445
What about Tsui?

495
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:22,770
He said he hasn't see him for a long time.

496
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:23,750
You believe him?

497
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:24,250
<i>Well...</i>

498
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,575
I sent you something
yesterday by messenger.

499
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,696
by the name of Nikita Angeloupoulous.

500
00:43:29,696 --> 00:43:30,731
Did you get it?

501
00:43:31,913 --> 00:43:33,639
I got it this morning.

502
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:36,309
Good. It's something very important.

503
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:38,550
Please hide it somewhere safe for me.

504
00:43:40,397 --> 00:43:41,676
Tsui is a good son.

505
00:43:41,676 --> 00:43:43,114
I think he'll come to visit.

506
00:43:43,114 --> 00:43:45,131
We should stay in this place.

507
00:43:45,131 --> 00:43:47,588
What if Uncle Seven dies
and the good son doesn't show?

508
00:43:47,863 --> 00:43:49,866
If he die, he will show up for sure.

509
00:43:49,866 --> 00:43:51,025
Why are you so sure?

510
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,821
He's the only son in the family.

511
00:43:52,821 --> 00:43:54,253
<i>He has to...</i>

512
00:43:58,133 --> 00:43:59,943
Carrying a flat bag of water.

513
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:02,821
What is all this?

514
00:44:03,298 --> 00:44:04,833
That's a Chinese tradition.

515
00:44:05,306 --> 00:44:07,245
It's likely that you're being followed.

516
00:44:08,601 --> 00:44:09,850
Always be careful.

517
00:44:12,689 --> 00:44:13,884
I've got to go.

518
00:44:14,878 --> 00:44:16,060
You'll take this.

519
00:44:16,466 --> 00:44:18,173
You might need it when you follow the girl.

520
00:44:32,137 --> 00:44:34,423
Take care. If anything
happens call us right away.

521
00:44:34,423 --> 00:44:35,162
OK

522
00:44:41,149 --> 00:44:42,348
– Hi
– Hi, Annie

523
00:44:42,348 --> 00:44:44,371
I'd like to pick up my package, please.

524
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,500
(man)
Bye.

525
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,035
- Here you go.
- OK, thank you.

526
00:44:48,035 --> 00:44:48,822
Bye, Annie

527
00:45:15,927 --> 00:45:16,996
I thought you'd gone already.

528
00:45:16,996 --> 00:45:18,406
Oh, not yet.

529
00:45:18,406 --> 00:45:19,942
– OK.
– OK, bye-bye.

530
00:47:45,494 --> 00:47:46,828
You scared me!

531
00:47:52,397 --> 00:47:53,367
Bye-bye

532
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,145
Keep singing

533
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,914
I think he's following the girl.

534
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,578
Come back! Come back.

535
00:49:52,578 --> 00:49:54,146
Come on, Rhett, come on.

536
00:49:58,148 --> 00:49:59,322
Keep him away please?

537
00:49:59,322 --> 00:50:01,312
What are you doing?! Oh my god!

538
00:50:06,323 --> 00:50:07,563
What's going on?

539
00:50:08,617 --> 00:50:09,811
We lost the feed.

540
00:50:09,911 --> 00:50:12,618
Track down Jackie's car.
Give me the location.

541
00:50:24,801 --> 00:50:26,086
He's at the Under Water World.

542
00:50:26,219 --> 00:50:28,460
Obviously, something is going wrong there.

543
00:50:34,435 --> 00:50:36,028
(Tsui)
<i>Now we can talk.</i>

544
00:50:36,028 --> 00:50:38,040
– <i>You speak Mandarin?</i>
– Yes.

545
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:40,133
I know you're with
the Hong Kong police.

546
00:50:40,867 --> 00:50:42,072
Who are you workin with right now?

547
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,235
Used to be CIA.

548
00:50:43,235 --> 00:50:45,100
and now it's the FSB.

549
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,027
You have a complicated background.

550
00:50:47,027 --> 00:50:48,312
It was quite simple.

551
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,843
You were sent here by Gregor Yegerov?

552
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:52,427
Do you know him, too?

553
00:50:54,472 --> 00:50:55,807
How do you get in touch with him?

554
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:08,434
Hello. Yes. This is Jackie speaking.

555
00:51:12,827 --> 00:51:14,055
It's me.

556
00:51:15,391 --> 00:51:16,504
It's Tsui.

557
00:51:16,856 --> 00:51:19,375
I'm here with your  Hong
Kong policeman now.

558
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:22,159
So you want to get rid
of me without paying?

559
00:51:22,401 --> 00:51:26,774
Fine. I want double now.
In cash. You got 3 days.

560
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:31,589
I have your phone now. I'll call you and let you know where and when to meet.

561
00:51:36,518 --> 00:51:39,555
I'm sorry I had to do that to you.

562
00:51:41,042 --> 00:51:42,612
<i>but look at what's in your second button.</i>

563
00:51:44,171 --> 00:51:47,254
<i>You'll find them in your car
and everything they gave you,</i>

564
00:51:47,254 --> 00:51:49,916
<i>including this pair
of very ugly underwear.</i>

565
00:51:51,003 --> 00:51:52,994
<i>You're under their surveillance
at every moment.</i>

566
00:51:54,332 --> 00:51:56,368
To them you're just a hunting dog.

567
00:51:56,808 --> 00:51:59,891
The less you know, the safer you are.

568
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,509
By the way, you're a lousy singer.

569
00:52:18,338 --> 00:52:20,704
Everything is here, but the jacket is missing.

570
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:22,800
Here's the wallet.

571
00:52:28,424 --> 00:52:29,334
Are you OK?

572
00:52:29,334 --> 00:52:30,323
<i>Yes</i>

573
00:52:30,624 --> 00:52:31,783
Where is Tsui?

574
00:52:32,068 --> 00:52:33,057
He's gone.

575
00:52:33,658 --> 00:52:35,150
What did he tell you?

576
00:52:35,876 --> 00:52:37,195
What do you think he told me?

577
00:52:38,086 --> 00:52:40,452
Seems like you two have
some kind of deal going on.

578
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,235
Don't believe what he said.

579
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:44,150
He is an expert iin playing mind games.

580
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:45,783
He's a top CIA agent.

581
00:52:45,783 --> 00:52:48,525
He's trained to play
around with people's brains.

582
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:53,258
Maybe you're right,
but how do you explain this?

583
00:52:54,527 --> 00:52:57,546
<i>We have to look out for you.
It's part of our job.</i>

584
00:52:57,546 --> 00:52:59,161
Why don't you tell me before?

585
00:52:59,161 --> 00:53:03,780
Whatever it is, you wanted me to
find Tsui, now he found you!

586
00:53:05,156 --> 00:53:08,273
I will write a full report to my
superior and your superior.

587
00:53:09,156 --> 00:53:10,600
<i>I'm out.</i>

588
00:53:10,953 --> 00:53:13,365
<i>That's your clothes,
that's your car.</i>

589
00:53:15,374 --> 00:53:16,784
This my wallet.

590
00:53:19,116 --> 00:53:22,153
(in Russian)
Goodbye. Goodbye.

591
00:53:28,385 --> 00:53:30,670
(in Cantonese)
 going. Bye-bye.

592
00:54:02,693 --> 00:54:04,021
Now kill him!

593
00:54:04,021 --> 00:54:05,499
Let's have some fun first.

594
00:54:05,499 --> 00:54:08,255
<i>He's supposed to be a good fighter.</i>

595
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:22,339
Had enough?

596
00:55:40,574 --> 00:55:42,519
Why is it taking so long?

597
00:55:43,253 --> 00:55:45,183
This guy can move like a monkey.

598
00:57:06,469 --> 00:57:07,922
Don't push me

599
00:57:08,809 --> 00:57:10,002
or I jump.

600
00:57:14,255 --> 00:57:16,541
OK. Go ahead.

601
00:57:23,304 --> 00:57:25,301
Come. Come to get me.

602
00:57:40,437 --> 00:57:41,472
Go get him!

603
00:57:42,302 --> 00:57:43,838
<i>You</i> go and get him!

604
00:58:04,037 --> 00:58:05,902
(Woman)
<i>Who is it?</i>

605
00:58:05,902 --> 00:58:07,642
Who is it?

606
00:58:08,065 --> 00:58:09,305
Who is it?

607
00:58:09,576 --> 00:58:11,279
Who is it?

608
00:58:14,697 --> 00:58:15,527
Who are you?

609
00:58:15,527 --> 00:58:16,753
Me?

610
00:58:16,753 --> 00:58:18,504
I'm the window cleaner.

611
00:58:18,504 --> 00:58:22,545
Win...Window clean..? No. No, wait you...

612
00:58:30,368 --> 00:58:31,594
– Who are you?
– Huh?

613
00:58:32,531 --> 00:58:33,725
I'm the dry cleaner.

614
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,598
Dry cleaner?

615
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,004
Anna!

616
00:58:38,364 --> 00:58:40,578
– Who was that man?!
– He's the window cleaner.

617
00:58:40,578 --> 00:58:42,273
He told me that he was the dry cleaner.

618
00:58:42,273 --> 00:58:44,434
What? You mean I'm lying?

619
00:58:44,876 --> 00:58:47,024
But I believed him, I'm sure.

620
00:59:09,604 --> 00:59:11,595
(Jackie in Cantonese)
<i>They want to kill me for knowing too much!</i>

621
00:59:12,042 --> 00:59:13,631
Just a second!

622
00:59:14,162 --> 00:59:15,447
Who wants to kill you?

623
00:59:18,024 --> 00:59:20,891
Gregor? But you are
working for him!

624
00:59:21,267 --> 00:59:22,382
Did you call the police?

625
00:59:22,754 --> 00:59:25,156
I don't have a passport,
I came over illegally.

626
00:59:25,843 --> 00:59:28,584
How could you make
things this complicated?

627
00:59:28,729 --> 00:59:30,299
I'll call the Australian police.

628
00:59:30,299 --> 00:59:32,415
You go and report this tomorrow,
and they will help you.

629
00:59:32,415 --> 00:59:34,235
Just find some hotel
to spend the night tonight.

630
00:59:34,973 --> 00:59:37,009
Stay in a hotel? I've got less
than 50 bucks left.

631
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,307
Keep talking like this and
I can't afford the phone bill.

632
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:41,337
So what are you going to do?

633
00:59:41,396 --> 00:59:43,136
(Jackie)
<i>I'll sleep on the street tonight.</i>

634
00:59:43,661 --> 00:59:45,526
Good idea! Safer than the hotel.

635
00:59:45,526 --> 00:59:48,017
We're 2 hours in advance here!

636
00:59:48,642 --> 00:59:49,882
I'll wake up early!

637
00:59:59,916 --> 01:00:01,156
(woman on phone)
<i>Go ahead.</i>

638
01:00:01,156 --> 01:00:04,239
Sherry, call the FSB
headquarters for me.

639
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:06,480
Ask for General Smirnov

640
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,299
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

641
01:00:40,023 --> 01:00:41,404
– Yes?!
– <i>Oi!</i>

642
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:43,560
<i>Get out of my bed!</i>

643
01:00:44,551 --> 01:00:46,473
Sorry.

644
01:00:49,841 --> 01:00:50,699
Anyone here?

645
01:00:50,699 --> 01:00:53,441
<i>Nah. He's on holiday.</i>

646
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:00,289
– <i>Hey!</i>
– Yes?

647
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:01,434
<i>Gimme a hand.</i>

648
01:01:01,434 --> 01:01:03,327
–Yes?
– <i>Hit the wall.</i>

649
01:01:05,051 --> 01:01:05,860
<i>Harder!</i>

650
01:01:08,368 --> 01:01:09,890
<i>Good night.</i>

651
01:01:11,455 --> 01:01:12,565
Goodnight.

652
01:01:19,294 --> 01:01:21,824
(Detective)
<i>Miss Tsui, the killer's still out there</i>

653
01:01:21,915 --> 01:01:23,826
<i>This might be a pretty
dangerous couple of days.</i>

654
01:01:24,042 --> 01:01:25,841
Go back with your friend and get some rest.

655
01:01:25,841 --> 01:01:27,957
<i>And I'll have a uniform
unit take you home</i>

656
01:01:27,957 --> 01:01:29,276
<i>and protect you 24 hours.</i>

657
01:01:32,925 --> 01:01:33,960
(Allen)
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

658
01:01:35,803 --> 01:01:37,168
<i>This guy is unreal.</i>

659
01:01:37,168 --> 01:01:38,453
We've got a tough on our hands, Louis.

660
01:01:39,063 --> 01:01:43,306
Get this videotape analyzed. See if
the murderer really is the same guy.

661
01:01:43,895 --> 01:01:47,058
Contact Hong Kong police, the CIA

662
01:01:47,148 --> 01:01:48,513
and Russian FSB.

663
01:01:48,608 --> 01:01:49,927
Get a positive I.D. on this guy.

664
01:01:50,026 --> 01:01:51,095
Straight away, sir!

665
01:01:53,565 --> 01:01:54,679
(woman 1)
<i>How was your holiday?</i>

666
01:01:54,679 --> 01:01:56,145
(woman 2)
<i>It was great!</i>

667
01:02:37,282 --> 01:02:39,237
– Good morning.
– Good morning, Hi.

668
01:02:47,517 --> 01:02:48,444
Excuse me.

669
01:02:48,782 --> 01:02:51,129
My wallet get stolen. Can
I borrow some money, please?

670
01:02:53,922 --> 01:02:55,958
I just want to make
a long distance call.

671
01:02:56,593 --> 01:02:57,912
– No!
– Just few coins!

672
01:03:00,523 --> 01:03:02,035
I haven't had breakfast yet.

673
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:10,721
Excuse me. Your bear.

674
01:03:11,211 --> 01:03:12,690
Oh, thank you.

675
01:03:14,784 --> 01:03:16,228
Can you do me a favor?

676
01:03:16,577 --> 01:03:17,521
Yes?

677
01:03:17,661 --> 01:03:19,322
Can I borrow some money from you?

678
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:20,080
Yes!

679
01:03:21,457 --> 01:03:22,822
Give me your address,
I promise send you back.

680
01:03:22,822 --> 01:03:23,732
No, no, no.

681
01:03:23,959 --> 01:03:25,414
– Thank you.
– Don't worry.

682
01:03:25,414 --> 01:03:25,914
Thank you.

683
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:27,530
Your newspaper!

684
01:03:27,587 --> 01:03:28,076
Keep it.

685
01:03:29,168 --> 01:03:30,158
Thank you.

686
01:03:30,925 --> 01:03:31,869
(in Cantonese)
What a nice lady!

687
01:03:34,552 --> 01:03:36,918
There is big trouble in
Brisbane's Chinatown.

688
01:03:36,918 --> 01:03:38,455
The man who controlled it all

689
01:03:38,455 --> 01:03:40,722
the head of the Golden Dragon
Association, Uncle Seven...

690
01:03:40,806 --> 01:03:41,602
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

691
01:03:41,602 --> 01:03:43,328
- Can I have some change?
- Sure.

692
01:03:43,328 --> 01:03:45,918
<i>...at Saint Paul Memorial
Hospital late last night.</i>

693
01:03:47,719 --> 01:03:50,471
Although unnoticed by staff,
the killer was spotted

694
01:03:50,471 --> 01:03:52,499
by the hospital security cameras.

695
01:03:52,985 --> 01:03:54,540
<i>And after looking at the video</i>

696
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:57,092
– <i>The daughter of Uncle Seven believes</i>
– Sir, here's your money.

697
01:03:57,092 --> 01:04:00,822
to be a Hong Kong policeman
known to her only as Jackie

698
01:04:00,822 --> 01:04:03,814
<i>and who visited Uncle
Seven earlier in the day.</i>

699
01:04:04,834 --> 01:04:07,667
<i>Police have yet to pinpoint 
a motive of a murder</i>

700
01:04:07,667 --> 01:04:10,079
<i>The killer is still on the loose
in the streets of Brisbane,</i>

701
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,086
<i>the subject of a city-wide manhunt.</i>

702
01:04:13,086 --> 01:04:15,136
<i>Authorities fear that
the murder of Uncle Seven</i>

703
01:04:15,136 --> 01:04:17,575
– Hey, that was the murder suspect!
–<i>...will mean chaos in Chinatown</i>

704
01:04:17,575 --> 01:04:19,310
– <i>...for a long time to come</i>
– Look!

705
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,135
...<i>and now to our...</i>

706
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:20,053
Allen

707
01:05:23,692 --> 01:05:24,946
I didn't kill your dad.

708
01:05:26,397 --> 01:05:27,557
Call the police!

709
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:28,090
Wait!

710
01:05:29,129 --> 01:05:31,128
Would I be here if I killed him?

711
01:05:33,338 --> 01:05:34,210
Listen to me...

712
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:36,647
Let me say something!

713
01:05:36,717 --> 01:05:37,923
Do you want me to call the police?

714
01:05:37,923 --> 01:05:38,431
Wait.

715
01:05:42,975 --> 01:05:43,993
Wait!

716
01:05:44,453 --> 01:05:45,302
Listen to me.

717
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,204
Can you tell me where your brother is?

718
01:05:50,064 --> 01:05:51,600
You still want to find my brother?

719
01:05:51,929 --> 01:05:54,488
Once we find him, he can
prove that I'm not murderer.

720
01:05:55,235 --> 01:05:57,271
You got my dad killed just
when you showed up.

721
01:05:57,362 --> 01:05:59,023
Now you want to get my brother too?

722
01:05:59,073 --> 01:06:00,931
Just how did we offend you?

723
01:06:04,119 --> 01:06:05,410
Beat him up first!

724
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:22,619
<i>There!</i>

725
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:23,908
<i>Up there!</i>

726
01:07:27,757 --> 01:07:29,371
Tell the brothers to come up!

727
01:10:01,713 --> 01:10:02,783
(Tsui)
<i>Allen</i>

728
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:04,313
(Allen)
<i>Brother Tsui!</i>

729
01:10:05,081 --> 01:10:06,303
He didn't kill my dad.

730
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:10,711
You guys go downstairs

731
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:13,679
Could you come this way, please?

732
01:10:23,381 --> 01:10:24,003
(Allen)
<i>Let's go.</i>

733
01:10:28,382 --> 01:10:29,076
Let's go.

734
01:10:37,297 --> 01:10:39,367
I think I know who's the murderer.

735
01:10:39,717 --> 01:10:41,503
Gregor has found a way
to make you show up.

736
01:10:41,997 --> 01:10:43,688
What exactly is your relationship with him?

737
01:10:45,346 --> 01:10:48,433
Three years ago, I tried to collect
intelligence on nuclear weapons.

738
01:10:48,433 --> 01:10:50,219
in Ukraine for the CIA.

739
01:10:51,061 --> 01:10:52,631
But then the KGB found out.

740
01:10:54,731 --> 01:10:56,596
<i>and two of my colleagues got killed.</i>

741
01:11:03,115 --> 01:11:06,607
Natasha! Natasha! Natasha!

742
01:11:21,639 --> 01:11:23,004
<i>Natasha!</i>

743
01:11:23,281 --> 01:11:24,447
Natasha!

744
01:11:26,639 --> 01:11:30,131
<i>They caught me and made
me spy on both sides.</i>

745
01:11:31,519 --> 01:11:34,807
For the sake of Natasha, I agreed.

746
01:11:34,854 --> 01:11:36,970
Gregor was the KGB agent?

747
01:11:37,899 --> 01:11:40,811
Yes, and he's now the head
of the New Russian Mafia.

748
01:11:41,361 --> 01:11:44,023
His position in the FSB makes it
easier for him to commit crimes.

749
01:11:44,322 --> 01:11:46,450
So he wants to buy
a nuclear warhead?

750
01:11:48,203 --> 01:11:49,113
He's trading nuclear weapons

751
01:11:49,842 --> 01:11:53,581
for an oil franchise in the Middle East.

752
01:11:53,581 --> 01:11:55,947
You should give the warhead
to the police right away.

753
01:11:56,690 --> 01:11:58,971
I won't unless I get the money.

754
01:12:00,047 --> 01:12:02,163
How many people have
you killed for money?

755
01:12:02,299 --> 01:12:04,585
Your father died because
you wanted the money.

756
01:12:04,759 --> 01:12:06,841
If the bomb falls into the hands of a madman

757
01:12:06,929 --> 01:12:08,669
a nuclear war will break out.

758
01:12:08,764 --> 01:12:10,334
World peace will be affected.

759
01:12:10,474 --> 01:12:11,964
You're so naive!

760
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,300
Do you know how many
nuclear weapons have been sold

761
01:12:14,353 --> 01:12:16,844
all over the world by military superpowers?

762
01:12:17,021 --> 01:12:19,307
I'm just selling one for myslef.

763
01:12:19,441 --> 01:12:21,352
The difference is that they
sell it in the name of a country.

764
01:12:21,444 --> 01:12:22,980
But I sell it for myself.

765
01:12:24,028 --> 01:12:26,110
<i>You think there will be
world peace just if I don't sell it?</i>

766
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,481
There's truth in what you've said.
We can't change the world.

767
01:12:28,576 --> 01:12:30,316
But we still can't use it as an excuse.

768
01:12:30,661 --> 01:12:33,073
We humans have done
enough harm to the Earth

769
01:12:33,121 --> 01:12:34,861
and now we're still doing nuclear tests.

770
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,952
keep it that way and
we're destroying ourselves.

771
01:12:40,332 --> 01:12:42,368
Your heroism concept doesn't apply to me.

772
01:12:43,845 --> 01:12:45,005
I'm no hero.

773
01:12:45,005 --> 01:12:48,293
But if we can't stop them,
we shouldn't encourage them.

774
01:12:51,974 --> 01:12:52,417
Annie,

775
01:12:52,725 --> 01:12:56,353
You've got dad killed just because of money.

776
01:12:56,353 --> 01:12:58,639
I will never forgive you for that.

777
01:13:03,991 --> 01:13:05,731
I'll settle with Gregor.

778
01:13:05,738 --> 01:13:07,979
And I'll give you all the
evidence of his crimes.

779
01:13:08,266 --> 01:13:09,676
But I'll need your help.

780
01:13:10,949 --> 01:13:13,281
Stay here for now. And don't use the phone.

781
01:13:13,871 --> 01:13:14,938
I know.

782
01:13:25,508 --> 01:13:30,377
I had great expectations
when I joined the CIA.

783
01:13:30,734 --> 01:13:33,852
But then I found that I've done a lot
of things that I wasn't very proud of.

784
01:13:34,308 --> 01:13:36,344
They wouldn't let me
contact my family.

785
01:13:37,505 --> 01:13:39,120
I've lost my self-respect.

786
01:13:41,131 --> 01:13:43,543
I would have died 3 years ago.

787
01:13:43,912 --> 01:13:46,278
If I didn't make a deal with Gregor.

788
01:13:48,418 --> 01:13:50,704
This is not what I expected.

789
01:13:50,795 --> 01:13:51,739
Brother.

790
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:34,019
We're at the funeral of Uncle Seven

791
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:35,911
the head of the Golden Dragon Association,

792
01:14:35,911 --> 01:14:38,178
who was brutally murdered last week.

793
01:14:38,178 --> 01:14:42,320
<i>There's a strong police presence presence
here today to escort a 60-meter long dragon </i>

794
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:46,176
<i>which signifies the  spirit of Uncle
Seven to the heart of Chinatown.</i>

795
01:14:47,267 --> 01:14:49,282
VKR, this is Bravo 840

796
01:14:49,282 --> 01:14:51,261
We're leaving Holy Trinity with Tsui.

797
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,660
(in Russian)
Lots of police here.

798
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,814
I'm here at Wickham Square.

799
01:15:37,814 --> 01:15:38,709
Where are you?

800
01:15:39,172 --> 01:15:40,896
(Tsui)
<i>Just stay where you are</i>

801
01:16:50,064 --> 01:16:51,053
Not bad.

802
01:16:51,053 --> 01:16:53,977
You even share the same
coffin with your father.

803
01:16:53,977 --> 01:16:56,005
The coffin is for you.

804
01:16:56,005 --> 01:16:57,649
You killed my father!

805
01:16:57,649 --> 01:16:59,371
He had to die somehow.

806
01:16:59,371 --> 01:17:01,642
At least he died for a reason.

807
01:17:06,449 --> 01:17:08,314
You're going to die in front of him!

808
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:11,032
Tsui, you promised to
hand him to the police!

809
01:17:18,135 --> 01:17:21,502
If you move one more step,
they'll blow your head.

810
01:17:22,032 --> 01:17:24,968
Tsui, it's not the first time we deal.

811
01:17:24,968 --> 01:17:27,872
You really think you can finish me here?

812
01:17:32,191 --> 01:17:32,816
Open!

813
01:17:42,402 --> 01:17:43,892
(in Russian)
I'm blocked by the umbrellas!

814
01:17:43,986 --> 01:17:45,312
Go back up the boss!

815
01:17:46,155 --> 01:17:47,224
(in English)
Now what?!

816
01:17:47,991 --> 01:17:49,902
Killing me won't bring him back.

817
01:17:50,034 --> 01:17:52,070
Give me the bomb, and I'll
give you the money. I promise.

818
01:17:52,203 --> 01:17:54,125
And then you'll never see me again.

819
01:17:56,833 --> 01:17:59,074
You think your money can
pay for my father's life?

820
01:17:59,074 --> 01:18:01,045
No, I guess not.

821
01:18:01,045 --> 01:18:03,023
But I got your sister.

822
01:18:04,882 --> 01:18:05,796
Look!

823
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:13,588
<i>She's young, sexy, beautiful.</i>

824
01:18:13,601 --> 01:18:15,341
You don't want her to die.

825
01:18:15,393 --> 01:18:16,758
You bastard!

826
01:18:18,198 --> 01:18:20,439
You guys have no rules!

827
01:18:20,439 --> 01:18:23,110
I have wife and kids in Russia.

828
01:18:23,124 --> 01:18:24,694
You could do the same thing.

829
01:18:24,694 --> 01:18:26,559
But it's too late!

830
01:18:27,177 --> 01:18:28,849
Move again, I'll break your arm.

831
01:18:34,937 --> 01:18:35,850
(in Mandarin)
Come here, I'll help you.

832
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:51,539
(in English)
If you don't give me the bomb,

833
01:18:51,638 --> 01:18:54,596
I'll kill both of you right now.
I know you've got it here.

834
01:18:54,641 --> 01:18:57,428
No. You have
to let her go first!

835
01:18:57,517 --> 01:18:58,381
(in Mandarin)
Brother!

836
01:18:58,381 --> 01:18:59,227
Annie.

837
01:19:05,609 --> 01:19:07,474
Annie, get out of here.

838
01:19:07,654 --> 01:19:08,973
Give my stuff to the police.

839
01:19:09,072 --> 01:19:10,094
OK

840
01:19:10,819 --> 01:19:12,207
Put him in the coffin.

841
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:17,831
Hurry up!

842
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:23,599
Run! Quick!

843
01:20:57,433 --> 01:20:58,577
Can I help you?

844
01:20:58,577 --> 01:20:59,077
Yes

845
01:21:15,399 --> 01:21:16,388
(in English)
Yes!

846
01:21:16,781 --> 01:21:17,915
(in Mandarin)
Let's go!

847
01:21:21,942 --> 01:21:24,806
We have officer down, officer down!
We need backup immediately.

848
01:21:45,189 --> 01:21:46,278
Up!

849
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:15,473
(in Mandarin)
Help! Help! Hurry help me!

850
01:22:15,473 --> 01:22:18,473

Please, help me! Help me!

851
01:22:18,473 --> 01:22:20,340
(in Mandarin)
Hurry, help me!

852
01:22:25,530 --> 01:22:26,633
Excuse me

853
01:22:27,763 --> 01:22:29,580
(in Mandarin)
Help me!

854
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:31,000
<i>Help me!</i>

855
01:22:32,369 --> 01:22:33,944
(Annie)
<i>Help me!</i>

856
01:22:39,297 --> 01:22:40,993
(in English)
Please, help me!

857
01:22:42,677 --> 01:22:43,903
- Are you OK?
- Yes

858
01:22:43,903 --> 01:22:46,194
– How did you get on top of the lift?
–Uh...

859
01:22:46,449 --> 01:22:48,489
OK, thank you very much. Goodbye!

860
01:22:48,489 --> 01:22:49,717
Hang on a minute.

861
01:22:49,717 --> 01:22:51,821
We got to write a
report, call the police.

862
01:22:52,077 --> 01:22:53,078
OK?

863
01:22:53,078 --> 01:22:56,644
Central security, we're on the
top floor The girl's all OK.

864
01:22:56,644 --> 01:23:00,137
Please call the police. Mick and me
are coming down to fill out a report.

865
01:23:01,408 --> 01:23:03,625
You're very familiar, I 
think I've seen you before.

866
01:23:06,033 --> 01:23:06,895
Don't move!

867
01:23:09,297 --> 01:23:10,561
He hasn't got a gun.

868
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:19,395
Be careful!

869
01:23:19,395 --> 01:23:20,370
Sorry

870
01:23:20,744 --> 01:23:21,976
Go, go, go!

871
01:23:32,169 --> 01:23:34,035
(in Russian)
They're at the east wing, go get them!

872
01:23:34,216 --> 01:23:37,030
<i>We're live here at Wickham Square
where the funeral of Uncle Seven</i>

873
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:40,128
<i>has turned into the biggest
gang war in Chinatown</i>

874
01:23:40,128 --> 01:23:43,844
<i>A group of terrorists, allegedly members
of the new Russian Mafia,</i>

875
01:23:43,844 --> 01:23:47,435
<i>gunned down the ceremony
with a rocket propelled grenade.</i>

876
01:23:47,435 --> 01:23:49,363
Police say the murder suspect, Jackie

877
01:23:49,363 --> 01:23:53,388
was last seen escaping through this 
mall with Uncle Seven's daughter.

878
01:23:53,388 --> 01:23:57,559
Investigations continue as more
bloodshed is expected in Chinatown.

879
01:23:59,226 --> 01:24:01,717
Inspector, results of the
tape have come back.

880
01:24:02,102 --> 01:24:03,223
That's not Jackie.

881
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:04,516
I think it's a set up.

882
01:24:09,531 --> 01:24:11,943
Sherry, I want to return a call to officer...

883
01:24:12,365 --> 01:24:14,117
Tung Bill in Hong Kong.

884
01:24:26,372 --> 01:24:27,043
(Annie)
<i>Oh, sorry!</i>

885
01:24:45,863 --> 01:24:48,354
Annie, I've got to make
a long distance call.

886
01:24:48,354 --> 01:24:49,844
Use the phone in the office upstairs.

887
01:24:51,069 --> 01:24:53,558
– Annie, sorry about your dad.
– <i>Oh, thank you.</i>

888
01:24:57,078 --> 01:24:58,142
(Gregor, in Russian)
<i>Where is everybody?</i>

889
01:25:00,008 --> 01:25:00,918
<i>They're on their way</i>

890
01:25:00,918 --> 01:25:02,601
They're in the staff room. Go there.

891
01:25:02,601 --> 01:25:03,302
Yes

892
01:25:05,827 --> 01:25:07,705
Don't do anything foolish
without my command.

893
01:25:07,705 --> 01:25:08,781
Yes, sir!

894
01:25:10,343 --> 01:25:12,629
(in Cantonese)
Uncle Bill, it's me!

895
01:25:13,166 --> 01:25:15,703
Tsui's siter and I are going to
retrieve the uranium core.

896
01:25:15,703 --> 01:25:17,038
Tell me what should I do?

897
01:25:17,038 --> 01:25:20,246
Listen, I've called the head of the FSB.

898
01:25:20,246 --> 01:25:22,399
and told him the whole thing.

899
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,736
So have you informed the police here?

900
01:25:24,736 --> 01:25:28,604
I've told him and had your identity
clarified. You're not the murderer.

901
01:25:28,604 --> 01:25:30,026
But the most important thing to do...

902
01:25:30,026 --> 01:25:33,026
is to hand the warhead to the
Australian police once you get it.

903
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,614
(in Russian)
Go get the boat!

904
01:27:26,614 --> 01:27:27,854

01:28:04,337 --> 01:28:05,134

916
01:28:11,823 --> 01:28:13,017
Go down. Get him!

(thug)
<i>He's here!</i>

919
01:28:24,918 --> 01:28:25,926
Go down, get him!

920
01:28:28,228 --> 01:28:29,036
Quick, quick!

921
01:30:00,456 --> 01:30:01,586

Go! Go!

Shark!

924
01:30:06,968 --> 01:30:07,919
Sharks don't bite

925
01:30:08,149 --> 01:30:08,842
Huh?

926
01:30:09,192 --> 01:30:09,979
Go back!

927
01:30:13,564 --> 01:30:15,167
(both men)
– <i>Shark!</i>
– <i>There's a shark!</i>

928
01:30:15,167 --> 01:30:16,556
It’s just a small shark.

929
01:30:16,767 --> 01:30:17,948
Get a weapon!

930
01:30:17,975 --> 01:30:23,390
Go down. Kill them! Go! Go! Go!

931
01:34:49,490 --> 01:34:50,290
(Gregor, in Russian)
<i>Did you see it?</i>

932
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:51,680
(in English)
Yes, I think so!

933
01:34:51,959 --> 01:34:52,966
I think Jackie still has it.

934
01:34:52,966 --> 01:34:53,910
Go down, get him!

935
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:55,425
No! 2 already died!

936
01:34:55,425 --> 01:34:56,915
(in Russian)
<i>That's an order!</i>

937
01:34:57,457 --> 01:34:58,696
– <i>No.</i>
– That's an order!

938
01:35:27,449 --> 01:35:28,393
I can see them from the restaurant.

939
01:35:28,812 --> 01:35:29,800
Let's go!

940
01:36:04,583 --> 01:36:06,275
(in English)
Excuse me, is that a new show?

941
01:36:06,275 --> 01:36:07,160
<i>Yeah, what's going on?</i>

942
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,400
I don't know.

943
01:36:15,365 --> 01:36:16,593
<i>What's going on in there?</i>

944
01:36:18,786 --> 01:36:19,803
(crowdperson)
<i>It's real!</i>

945
01:36:22,009 --> 01:36:23,162
<i>Looks like a new show, or something.</i>

946
01:36:24,397 --> 01:36:26,126
<i>It's unbelievable, mate!</i>

947
01:38:49,922 --> 01:38:51,726
Get back! Get back!

948
01:38:56,787 --> 01:38:57,947
Stay where you are!

949
01:39:04,137 --> 01:39:05,297
(in Russian)
<i>Follow me!</i>

950
01:39:13,392 --> 01:39:14,677
(in English)
Give me the gun!

951
01:39:47,845 --> 01:39:48,783
Get her!

952
01:39:52,479 --> 01:39:54,048
Move. Get back!

953
01:40:35,633 --> 01:40:37,608
(Jackie)
Go, go, go! Move!

954
01:40:47,189 --> 01:40:48,610
Help! Help!

955
01:41:20,764 --> 01:41:21,820
Major problem in Under Water World!

956
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:24,351
Shots fired, explosions,
terrorists have taken over.

957
01:41:24,351 --> 01:41:26,046
And Jackie's there too. It's chaos!

958
01:41:26,046 --> 01:41:27,055
Get the chopper ready!

959
01:41:49,668 --> 01:41:50,532
Goodbye!

960
01:42:24,536 --> 01:42:25,716
(in Russian)
<i>Watch her!</i>

961
01:42:31,174 --> 01:42:32,459
(in English)
Run!

962
01:43:23,619 --> 01:43:25,989
(in Russian)
You have shamed our country!

963
01:43:26,630 --> 01:43:27,665
<i>Let's go!</i>

964
01:43:29,168 --> 01:43:30,810
(in Cantonese)
When you get back, give me a simple but

965
01:43:30,810 --> 01:43:33,643
detailed report describing
