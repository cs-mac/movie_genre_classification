If we do get it, it's gonna go
"Isi's Van" and then be red.

333
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,742
How are you putting your name
and picking the color?

334
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,540
Because I'm older than you,

335
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,173
I'm cooking,
and I'm driving that van.

336
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,116
All right, I'm sanding,
I'm priming,

337
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,086
I'm painting,
and doing the letters.

338
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,213
But my name's going
on that van.

339
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,258
All right, all right.
It's going like this.

340
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:30,123
My name is going diagonally.

341
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,026
Your initials can maybe go,
like, right here.

342
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,758
- Initials?
- Yeah.

343
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,426
All right, all right, "Isi."
That's it.

344
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,595
Nah, it's gonna go "Isi's Van,"

345
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:43,630
your name on the bottom,
just "Ale" for short.

346
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,801
No, no, no,
I want my whole name.

347
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,868
All right, little,
your whole name,

348
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:48,878
and it's gonna be red.

349
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,039
- Little?
- Yeah.

350
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,946
Why your name got to be so big?

351
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,780
Because it's gonna be my van.

352
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,979
Guys like girls' names anyways.

353
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,817
All right,
this is how it's gonna go.

354
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,722
My name goes on the van,
and you pick the color,

355
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:03,352
and I hold the money because
you don't know how to count.

356
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:04,554
What are you talking about?

You didn't go to school.

360
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:13,565
So what?
I still know how to count.

361
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,799
And you got to promise
to not eat all the food

362
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,171
and save some
for the customers,

363
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,676

getting too big by the minute.

Here.

382
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:28,575
What's this for?

383
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,207
It's money for the van
if you're serious.

384
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,443
I'll put this in my stash
tomorrow.

385

You sure you don't want to come?

No. Go have fun.

warming up in the bullpen.

Yeah.

389
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,699
It's a better view from up
here than over there.

390

Yeah.

391
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,538
Yo, I still think second base
is more important.

392
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:00,908
Nah, I don't think.

393
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,470
I think shortstop is.
You know why?

394
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:08,110
Because if they get, like,
if the ball hits to them,

395
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,416
they make the double play.

Aw, shoot, you saw that?
That was cool, man.

651
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:11,990
Yo, that was cool.
That was crazy.

652
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:14,155
Did you see that?

653
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:19,732
Is there anything else
we could throw?

654
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,169
Oh, snap, look.

655
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,037

Yo, what are y'all doing here?

658
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,148
What's up?

659
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:14,713
- Lilah, where's my sister?
- Go look for her.

660
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:16,554
What you talking about,
"Go look for her"?

661
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,287
And where y'all getting
these drinks from?

Where y'all going?

666
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,632
Yo, why the hell you leave
them here by themselves?

667
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:28,966
And where the hell were you?

668
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,700
I was at Stella's getting soda.

Yo, Lilah's going to Florida.

Yo, they got to go.

If Rob finds out,
then we're getting kicked out.

Ale, this is Lilah.

Those guys across the street
will tell Rob.

675

Come on, girl,
let's get out of here.

- Yo.
- What happened?

677
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,824
I'm not going.
I can't go.

678
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,985
- I got to work tomorrow.
- Just give me a call.

679
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,392
Yo, Lilah, send me a postcard.

680
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:54,396
Are you sure you can't go?

681
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:55,522
No, I can't.

682
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,159
I'm gonna see you around.

683

Look, little things like this
will get us kicked out.

684
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,341
Ale, leave it there.
I'm gonna clean it up.

685
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,845
And look at these, too.

686
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,438
Yeah, this is what happens
when your friends come over.

687
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:15,211
Ale, I said I would
fucking clean it up!

688
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:20,617
What?
What are you still doing here?

- $250.
- Come on, how much?

692
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,574
The lowest I can go is $200.

- $200?
- Yeah.

Of course I'll come see you.

you ditched me.

796

I need to know
who was upstairs today.

797
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:43,704
Why?

798
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:46,435
'Cause I'm missing money,
and I just need to know.

799
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:48,033
- What money?
- My money.

800
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:50,545
- Well, did you look carefully?
- Yeah.

801
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:51,705
- You sure?
- I'm positive.

802
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:52,713
I searched everywhere.

803

The person that comes in mind
to me is Lilah.

804

Again with Lilah?

805

She was the only one
in the room.

Look, I counted my money
yesterday.

807

Lilah hasn't been here
since last week.

808
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:04,316
Who else was here?

809
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:07,261
Well, Billy and Tony
are always up and down.

810
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,627
Billy and Tony?

811
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:09,756
But I don't understand

812
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,561
why you would leave
your money there anyway.

813
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:13,499
Ale, I'm living here.

814
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:15,867
I got to keep my stuff here,
too.

815
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:19,567
- Well, how much was it?
- I don't know.

816
01:01:19,642 --> 01:01:21,735
You just told me that you
counted it yesterday.

817
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:24,803
Look, I'm really upset
right now. I don't remember.

818
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:27,111
So, what you want me to do?

819
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,650
Nothing.

820
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:32,378
Look, the van is coming.
Don't worry about it.

821
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:33,922
We gonna make a lot of money.

822
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,389
Sure.

823
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:36,755
You gonna make your specials.

824
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:38,191
You know, they're getting
pretty good.

825
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,092
Okay.

826
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:42,097
So, who's locking up?
Me or you?

827
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:43,097
Oh, me.

828
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:44,098
You sure?
Yeah.

829
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:47,330
- You sure you know how to do it?
- I'm positive.

830
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:59,672
Man, we're gonna have to, like,
scrub that shit down.

831
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:02,013
[Laughs]

832
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:09,591
I can't wait to start
driving it.

833
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:12,753
I'm gonna go like this.
[Imitates tires squealing]

834
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:18,599
Yeah, we need to fix
the wheel, too.

835
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:23,366
Move over to the side
a little bit. Watch.

836
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:27,165
[Chains rattling]

837
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:38,210
And it's not going no blue.

838
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:39,481
Yes, it is.

839
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:40,544
It might be going...

840
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:44,252
So, no, 'cause we got to
change this.

841
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:45,453
I don't want the...

842
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:47,621
All right,
the whole van is white,

843
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:50,530
and then the tabs like this,
red.

844
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,261
No.

845
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:56,897
Yeah, like the window,
that, probably this is red.

846
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:58,770
Yeah, initials right here.

847
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:00,035
- Ale, let me see the paperwork.
- For what?

848
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:02,339
Just let me see the paperwork.

849
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:03,673
Did you guys look inside?

850
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:05,407
Yeah, it's a little beat up,
but it's all right.

851
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:06,607
A little beat up?

852
01:03:06,682 --> 01:03:08,445
You already know what specials
you're gonna make, right?

853
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:11,078
Number one is empanadas.

854
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:12,621
I knew that was the first one
coming.

855
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:13,950
Ale, are you stupid
or something?

856
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:15,923
What?

857
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:17,618
Look inside this place, man.

858
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:19,490
All this stuff has got to pass
health code.

859
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:21,120
They don't do health code
around here.

860
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:22,391
They don't even care about it.

861
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,557
Ale, man, look at this grill.

862
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,624
Okay, it's got rust on it.
Of course it does, man.

863
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:26,827
- So what?
- It does.

864
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:28,837
It says it right here.
Did you even read this?

865
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:30,270
Look.

866
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:32,705
Who signed that?
Did you sign it?

867
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:34,436
I did.

868
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:36,102
Did you read this?

869
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:37,373
It doesn't matter.

870
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:38,572
Ale, it matters.

871
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,582
You're gonna be serving food
out of this kitchen.

872
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,140
And, look,
there's no vents here.

873
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:44,379
There's holes everywhere.
It's rusted everywhere.

874
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:46,387
Come on, stop exaggerating.

875
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:47,820
We could clean that off.

876
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:49,414
Come on, Ale, man.

877
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,460
With some bodywork
and everything and a paint job,

878
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:54,052
yeah, it's gonna look fine
on the outside.

879
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,097
But I could fix it.

880
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,223
That's what I was trying to
tell you.

881
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,767
But it's the inside.
It's the kitchen equipment.

882
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,234
You're gonna spend $10,000
to fix that.

883
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:01,998
- Now you lying.
- Are you serious? $10,000?

884
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:03,095
He's lying.
Don't believe him.

885
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,104
What are you talking about?

886
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,162
I used to have one of these.

887
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:07,072
This is used equipment.
You can't fix those things.

888
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:08,303
You got to buy new ones, man.

889
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:10,072
Yo, what are we gonna do now,
Ale?

890
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:11,807
He don't know nothing
about our van.

891
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,075
"Don't believe him," I said.

892
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:14,912
Ale, how much you pay for this?

893
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:16,144
How much you pay for this?

894
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:17,686
$4,500.

895
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:19,812
$4,500?

896
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:21,516
Are you kidding me?

897
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:23,456
No, we're serious.

898
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,551
Yo, let's bring it back
to Carlos' uncle right now.

899
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:27,186
It's too late.
You guys signed the papers.

900
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:28,230
He's playing us.

901
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:29,855
Ale, where you going?

902
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:31,024
[Horn honks]

903
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,398
Ale.

904
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:34,993
Hey, Carlos.

905
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,368
What up, Ale?

906
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:38,669
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?

907
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:40,766
What's wrong with you, Ale?

908
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:43,209
- What is wrong with you, man?
- You were lying!

909
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:44,473
Come on, get off.

910
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,344
Yo, kid, what are you doing?

911
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:47,939
Relax, relax.

912
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:49,245
You lied!

913
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:51,377
You lied about them.
You made me go to your uncle.

914
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:53,081
You cheated me.

915
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:54,850
Your uncle took the papers,
right?

916
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:57,188
Yo, what are you doing?

917
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:02,460
I swear to God, I don't know
what he's talking about.

918
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:03,793
I swear to God.

919
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:06,096
If I find out you cheated me,
I'm gonna fuck you up.

920
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:08,136
What the hell is going on?

921
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:58,175
All right, big guy.

922
01:05:58,254 --> 01:06:00,347
You can wait until you have
enough money to fix this,

923
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:02,186
you can hope that some dumb ass
will come by

924
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:03,190
and maybe he'll buy it,

925
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:04,988
but you can't leave it here.

926
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:08,758
Or I'll give you $1,000, chop it
up for parts, and that's it.

927
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:10,992
You don't have to worry about
anything. It'll be done.

928
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:12,625
What do you want to do?

929
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:14,465
This thing's got to get
out of here.

930
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:17,597
I got a lot of things going on.
You know that.

931
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:21,868
Let me know what you want to do,
okay?

932
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:24,572
This thing's got to be out
by tomorrow.

933
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:34,451
Ale.

934
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:36,787
Ale, what's this shit I hear

935
01:06:36,859 --> 01:06:39,589
about you ending up
with this van?

936
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,061
Can I have my pay?

937
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,062
No, you can't have
your fucking pay.

938
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,359
What's the matter with you?

939
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:45,832
Listen, kid.
Listen to me.

940
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:47,493
What's going on with you
these days?

941
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,198
You got to straighten
this shit out.

942
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:52,365
Get back to work.

943
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:22,794
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

944
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,430
Welcome to the U. S. Open.

945
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:28,375
If you are here for the match at
center court, it is sold out.

946
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:33,177
If you have tickets, please
proceed to center court now.

947
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,523
Aah!

948
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:18,059
Hey! Stop him! Stop him!

949
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:20,823
Stop him! Stop him!

950
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:26,160
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

951
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:27,600
Welcome to the U. S. Open.

952
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:30,070
If you are here for the match
at center court...

953
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:18,986
Come on, Ral.
Hurry up, man.

954
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:20,487
Got to load that truck.

955
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:23,252
Hurry up, come on.

956
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:28,230
Fuck!

957
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:30,356
What do you want?

958
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:32,229
- What am I gonna do with that?
- I'm selling it.

959
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:35,600
Ale, I can't get rid of
this shit.

960
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:38,804
Come on, Ale,
I'm busy right now, all right?

961
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:40,273
Come back later or something,
all right?

962
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,242
You got something going on?

963
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:44,836
Ale, I can't do anything
with that shit, man.

964
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:46,745
You sign up, and you get
that phone for free.

965
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:48,840
Come on.

966
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:50,476
You got something going on
later?

967
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:51,918
Ale, I'm fucking busy right now.

968
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:54,751
Come back later, all right?

969
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:56,757
