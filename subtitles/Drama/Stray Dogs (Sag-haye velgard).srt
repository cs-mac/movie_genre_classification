STRAY DOGS
A FILM BY MARZIYEH MESHKINI

2
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,920
Zahed!

3
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,192
I've found a book.

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,390
Should we sell it or burn it?

5
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,440
Zahed! We're late.

6
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,756
They won't let us in.

7
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,199
Zahed, hurry! We're late.

8
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,510
There's the dog, come on!

9
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,918
Kill him!

10
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,392
Kill him!

11
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,400
He's a foreigners' dog.

12
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,909
He can't understand us.

13
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,349
He doesn't belong
to the Americans,

14
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:52,029
he's a fucking English dog!
He's hunting Taliban.

15
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,677
Come on, it's late.

16
00:03:18,877 --> 00:03:20,836
Hurry up!

17
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,240
He's a Russian dog.

18
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,954
He's looking for nuclear bombs.

19
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,593
Burn him!

20
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,915
He belongs to the Americans
who killed Zahed's dad.

21
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:42,633
Rescue him!

22
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:43,640
OK.

23
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,958
He belongs to the Americans
who killed our fathers.

24
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,518
He's not down there.

25
00:04:28,718 --> 00:04:32,314
Maybe he's dead.
Let's go.

26
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,631
Take the sacks.
I'll hide the dog.

27
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,152
I knocked. No one's coming.

28
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,158
I knocked.
They're not opening up.

29
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,478
Who is it?

30
00:05:52,678 --> 00:05:54,158
It's us.

31
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,989
It's late. Come back tomorrow.

32
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,796
Please open the door.

33
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,993
Visiting time's over.

34
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,830
We're not visitors,
we're night prisoners.

35
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,960
We're night prisoners.

36
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,478
So what are you doing out there?

37
00:06:28,678 --> 00:06:31,034
Officer Atef knows us.

38
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,350
Wait there. I'll check.

39
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,434
Why are you here so late?

40
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:53,240
This is a prison.
It's the last time!

41
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,032
What have you got there?

42
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,600
Dogs aren't allowed in here.

43
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,560
For the love of God,

44
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,469
let him in. If you don't,
the kids will burn him alive.

45
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:09,991
Don't you feel sorry for him?

46
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,676
OK, come in.

47
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,952
Search them.

48
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,315
What have you got in there?

49
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:15,112
Just wood and paper.

50
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,078
Hide the dog. Take this!

51
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,399
Go on.

52
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,392
You can take them.

53
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,393
If we hadn't brought him,

54
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,630
the kids would've burned him alive.

55
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,556
Death would be better
than this prison.

56
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,711
Put more wood on the fire.

57
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,835
Time to sleep. Settle down.

58
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,471
Time to sleep. Settle down.

59
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,992
Did you visit your father
in prison?

60
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:34,160
Yes.

61
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,989
Did your sister tell him
exactly what I told her?

62
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:43,800
No, she got it all mixed up.

63
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,629
Just repeat what I tell you, dear.

64
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:48,954
OK.

65
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,075
What are you going to say?

66
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,280
"When you lived with our mother,

67
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,360
"you beat her a lot.
So she didn't love you.

68
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,994
"When you disappeared,

69
00:11:16,194 --> 00:11:18,560
"she got married again.

70
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,832
"Her second husband
beat her less."

71
00:11:22,032 --> 00:11:26,680
No, don't say that.
He will never forgive me

72
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,474
and I'll stay in prison forever.

73
00:11:29,674 --> 00:11:31,829
He vanished for five years.

74
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:35,280
We thought he'd been killed.

75
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,357
Isn't that right, dear?

76
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,720
So you must tell him:

77
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,200
"We thought you'd been killed.

78
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,516
"Mum couldn't feed us.

79
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:52,040
"So she married again
so we could eat."

80
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,920
Your father will forgive me

81
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,953
and I'll be freed from prison.

82
00:11:58,153 --> 00:12:03,757
Remember, for five years
we thought he was dead.

83
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,711
Do you remember?

84
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,278
Gol-Ghotai!

85
00:12:13,478 --> 00:12:14,309
What?

86
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,960
Don't tell Dad
he beat her too much.

87
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,152
Say that our stepfather
beat her too much.

88
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,749
Pretend I'm Dad.
Practice.

89
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,120
"You didn't beat Mum too much.

90
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,474
"It was her second husband
who beat her.

91
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,557
"Forgive our mother.

92
00:12:41,757 --> 00:12:47,709
"Do you want her to die
in prison?"

93
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,439
Your father loves you very much.

94
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,311
He'll listen to you.

95
00:12:56,511 --> 00:13:00,876
You must tell him exactly
what I've told you.

96
00:13:01,076 --> 00:13:02,638
I understand.

97
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,352
Time to sleep, settle down.

98
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,313
Feed your baby.
He's keeping everyone awake.

99
00:13:55,513 --> 00:13:57,800
My milk's run out

100
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,800
and he's freezing.

101
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,913
- Give him to your mother.
- She can't look after him.

102
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,439
Time to sleep, settle down.

103
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,159
Please!

104
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,236
Give her this to burn.
Her baby's cold.

105
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,919
You can burn this.

106
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,912
Thank you very much.

107
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,635
Come along!

108
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,958
Gol-Ghotai!

109
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,800
Tell your father what I told you.

110
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,520
Tell him:
"You're a prisoner...

111
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,996
"Do you want to see me
a prisoner too?"

112
00:16:25,196 --> 00:16:28,715
"Tell him he vanished
for five years,

113
00:16:28,915 --> 00:16:31,160
"that you were fatherless,

114
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,158
"that my second husband is dead.

115
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,440
"Didn't you beat me enough?

116
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,438
"Will you be happy
if they execute me?"

117
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,080
Gol-Ghotai!

118
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,589
Let them execute me!

119
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,115
Don't forgive me!
Let them execute me!

120
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:53,913
Let me die in prison!

121
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,480
Let them kill me!

122
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,469
Why have you brought so little?

123
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,112
Pay me for my sister's wood.

124
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,228
Eat!

125
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,835
It's meat, it's meat!

126
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,950
It's meat.

127
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,672
Eat!

128
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,631
It smells like meat.

129
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,796
Eat, it's meat!

130
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,357
It smells like meat.

131
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,920
Aren't you hungry? Eat!

132
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,795
You're hungry, so eat!

133
00:21:14,995 --> 00:21:16,114
Eat!

134
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,435
It's just like meat.

135
00:21:19,635 --> 00:21:22,392
Aren't you hungry?

136
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,915
You must be hungry.

137
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,154
Pay me for my sister's wood.

138
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,800
They put our father in prison.

139
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,558
You have to wave to them!

140
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,348
- Hello!
- Hello!

141
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,599
How much is that rosary?

142
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,471
Ten Afghanis.

143
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,555
- And that one?
- Five Afghanis.

144
00:23:39,755 --> 00:23:41,120
Why is it cheaper?

145
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,153
That one brings fewer rewards
from God.

146
00:23:44,353 --> 00:23:46,236
That one brings more.

147
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,834
- Who's it for?
- For my father.

148
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,995
Does he pray often?

149
00:23:56,195 --> 00:23:58,120
Yes.

150
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,160
A lot or a little?

151
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,036
My father's a Taliban, in prison.
He prays night and day.

152
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,600
If he prays so much,

153
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,396
take this one which brings
the greatest rewards from God.

154
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,792
My father is a Taliban.

155
00:24:16,992 --> 00:24:20,753
A Taliban? Take this one,
it's more powerful.

156
00:24:20,953 --> 00:24:22,200
How much?

157
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,880
Twenty Afghanis.

158
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,280
That's too much.

159
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,471
But it brings the most rewards.

160
00:24:27,671 --> 00:24:29,636
- Five Afghanis.
- No.

161
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,314
That one's nice. I'll buy it.

162
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,393
This one?

163
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,989
Yes.

164
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,355
It's so beautiful!

165
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,638
I bought it for my father,
little doggie...

166
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,749
but you can have it.
You're so pretty!

167
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,836
What do you have to say to Dad?

168
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,640
I'll tell him:
"You disappeared for five years

169
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,673
"and Mum thought you were dead.

170
00:26:00,873 --> 00:26:05,555
"There was no one
to take care of us.

171
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,160
"So Mum got married again.

172
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,400
"You're in prison.

173
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,431
"Our mother's also in prison.

174
00:26:15,631 --> 00:26:20,190
"If they kill our mother,
what will happen to us?"

175
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,715
Mollah Rahman's children!

176
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,795
What will you tell Dad?

177
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:41,480
"You disappeared for five years.

178
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,400
"Mum thought you were dead,

179
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,480
"there was no one to look after us.

180
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,831
"So Mum got married again.

181
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:57,200
"You are in prison.

182
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,680
"So is my mother.

183
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,111
"Will you be happy
if they kill our mother?

184
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,157
"Who will take care of us then?

185
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,152
"Forgive our mother.
For our sake."

186
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,148
Mollah Rahman's children,
come.

187
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,557
Little girl, it's not your turn.
Come back tomorrow.

188
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,640
Can't I see my father?

189
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,717
It's not possible.

190
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,710
I have to talk to him.

191
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,591
Impossible.

192
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,080
OK.

193
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,032
Boy, you can come in.

194
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,197
Zahed, did you tell Dad
what Mum said?

195
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,832
- Did you tell him?
- Yes.

196
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,278
Did he feel sorry for us?

197
00:28:10,478 --> 00:28:13,560
He said: "I went to fight
in a Holy War.

198
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,716
"Your mother married again.

199
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:17,830
"Didn't she love me?"

200
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,597
She married again
because we were hungry.

201
00:28:22,797 --> 00:28:25,677
Now that man is dead.

202
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,560
Dad said that's good,
and if Mum dies,

203
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,796
they can make love in Hell.

204
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,792
What's Hell?

205
00:28:35,992 --> 00:28:39,480
It's the place where Angels

206
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,671
burn sinners up.

207
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,835
If he loves us,
he should forgive Mum.

208
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,912
Dad said:
"If you love your mother,

209
00:28:51,112 --> 00:28:54,396
"pray for her.
Pray God forgives her!"

210
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,709
They don't let dogs in.
Stay here. I'm going to pray.

211
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,597
Do you understand,
little doggie?

212
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,079
My brother's gone to pray

213
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,640
for my mother,

214
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,960
so God won't send her to Hell.

215
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,318
Do you know what Hell is?

216
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,711
Hell is a big, big pit
full of sinners

217
00:30:02,911 --> 00:30:08,676
and Angels
who cast fire down on them.

218
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,910
Do you understand what I'm saying,

219
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,680
poor little doggie?

220
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,476
Did they want to burn you alive
because you got married twice?

221
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,080
I saved you from Hell.

222
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,271
Do you remember?

223
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,028
Do you understand?

224
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,871
Pray, little doggie.

225
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,631
Pray for Mum.

226
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,597
<i>O Merciful God,</i>
<i>who forgives all sins</i>

227
00:30:48,797 --> 00:30:53,270
<i>I cry out to thee,</i>
<i>O Merciful God!</i>

228
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,280
We are night prisoners.

229
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,277
- What prisoners?
- Night prisoners.

230
00:32:33,477 --> 00:32:35,311
Who have you come to see?

231
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,835
Guard Atef knows us.

232
00:32:40,035 --> 00:32:42,633
Wait a moment.

233
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,960
Hello.

234
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,275
Hello, little one.

235
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:18,199
I'm sorry, but the governor
won't allow you to come in.

236
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,280
If I let you enter,

237
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,278
he'll put me in prison.
Forgive me.

238
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,280
But the governor isn't here.

239
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,711
Let us go and sleep
with our mother.

240
00:33:35,911 --> 00:33:39,040
We don't know where else to go.

241
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,390
Do you want us to sleep
on the street?

242
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:46,992
Let us sleep with our mother.

243
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,000
I'm truly sorry

244
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,120
but the governor won't allow it.

245
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,039
Goodbye! Look after yourselves.

246
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,319
OK.

247
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,273
Why are you still here?

248
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,910
Don't give me this baby.
Her mother's in prison.

249
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:20,032
Where will I find milk?

250
00:34:20,232 --> 00:34:23,680
Take it! Go on!

251
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,155
What will I do
with so many grandchildren?

252
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,555
The father of these two
was killed,

253
00:34:28,755 --> 00:34:31,840
so was the father
of the others,

254
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,715
and the baby's mother's in prison.
What will I do?

255
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,360
Zahed, I'm scared.

256
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,633
He's noisy because
he's scared too.

257
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,593
Cover your eyes
and you won't be scared.

258
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,238
Zahed, I need to pee.

259
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,720
Go a bit further off.

260
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,195
I'm scared to go far.

261
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,473
Do you want me to go?

262
00:35:59,673 --> 00:36:02,114
I'd still be scared.

263
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,520
Go and pee.

264
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,280
I'll keep talking
so you won't be scared.

265
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,440
OK. Look after the dog.

266
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,960
Gol-Ghotai.

267
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,310
The dog peed too.

268
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,438
Give him to me.

269
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,394
Look after the dog.

270
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,276
Son of a bitch!

271
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,792
Trying to trick me?

272
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,036
If you needed a place,
you should have knocked.

273
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,200
We didn't see you.
You're strangling me.

274
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,198
We didn't know it was your place.

275
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:37,198
We wanted to get out of the cold.

276
00:40:37,398 --> 00:40:39,879
Let go of my brother!

277
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,911
Leave him alone!

278
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,031
I didn't know you were here.

279
00:40:47,231 --> 00:40:49,719
Get off! You're strangling me!

280
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,600
How much can it bother you

281
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,950
if we stay here for one night?

282
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,196
Maybe just a little.

283
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,154
We didn't know.

284
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,431
OK. Get in!

285
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,630
We can go in?

286
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,952
Stick your head out.
We need to talk, man to man.

287
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,358
Who's that girl?

288
00:41:45,558 --> 00:41:47,560
She's my sister.

289
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,591
This place is dangerous.

290
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:53,880
Last night, they grabbed a girl
from one of the carts.

291
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,469
Don't let me see
your sister here again.

292
00:41:56,669 --> 00:41:59,560
We usually sleep in prison
with our mother.

293
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,069
But tonight
they wouldn't let us in.

294
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,160
So we came here.

295
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,555
I don't want to see her here again.

296
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,635
What are you scared of?

297
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,118
We're not thieves.

298
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,798
You're joking! Me, scared?
I escaped from prison.

299
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,631
Why were you in prison?

300
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:38,120
Me and a pal broke into
a video store

301
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,320
and the cops caught us.

302
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,880
- Is he still in prison?
- Yes.

303
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,310
I want to go to prison too.

304
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:47,160
It's not difficult.

305
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,669
Steal something
and you'll get there.

306
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:51,551
What's hard is staying out.

307
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,434
I couldn't work.
I'll pay you tomorrow.

308
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,995
Don't let me see
your sister here again.

309
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,670
What are you doing here?

310
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:21,240
We want to see our mother.

311
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,079
- What's her name?
- Shabaneh.

312
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,877
What was her crime?

313
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,070
My father disappeared
for five years.

314
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:45,920
She thought he was dead.

315
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:50,750
She remarried and my father
had her put in prison.

316
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,878
She's a whore.

317
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,236
Bastard, it's your mother
who's the whore!

318
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,277
Son of a bitch! Bastard!

319
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,159
Piece of shit!
Your mother's the whore!

320
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:21,909
Come here, son of a bitch!

321
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,916
Come on, Gol-Ghotai.

322
00:46:27,116 --> 00:46:29,952
Your mother's the whore!

323
00:46:30,152 --> 00:46:33,151
Run, Gol-Ghotai!

324
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,160
He's going to beat us up!

325
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,989
Bastard. Your father be damned!
Stop!

326
00:46:41,189 --> 00:46:43,998
If I catch you I'll kill you!

327
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,400
Don't beat my brother!

328
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,957
Officer, sir,
don't beat my brother!

329
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,910
Tell me,
what happened to your grandma?

330
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,956
What happened to your grandmother?

331
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,034
It was freezing last night.

332
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,751
Gol-Ghotai, come on.

333
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,151
I'll go and watch the TV.

334
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:15,510
When he gets out of the car,

335
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:18,600
we won't run away.

336
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,633
That way he'll get us.

337
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,920
I'm scared.

338
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,430
If he sees us, he'll beat us.

339
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,720
Stay here.

340
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,640
I'm going.
When he takes me to prison,

341
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:40,276
start crying. Say you're my sister
and you'll be arrested.

342
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,389
Come on. There's no one here.

343
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,678
He's locked up the TV.
He'll lock us up too.

344
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,120
Bastards!

345
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,869
I go for a piss
and you take over my house!

346
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,559
Bastards!

347
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,280
I just went for a piss!

348
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,436
You've moved in!

349
00:52:58,636 --> 00:53:01,360
If I piss in the North,

350
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,755
American occupies the South.

351
00:53:03,955 --> 00:53:06,000
If I piss to the South,

352
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,430
the Russians move in
on the North.

353
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:13,190
You won't even let me
shit in peace!

354
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,920
You want a shit?
Come down here!

355
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,160
I'll wash out the toilets.

356
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,238
Your bombs killed my wife
and my daughter!

357
00:53:25,438 --> 00:53:29,478
Now come and piss on my head,
fucking planes!

358
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,917
Fucking planes, come down here
and piss on me!

359
00:53:37,117 --> 00:53:39,280
This way to the toilets!

360
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,630
I'll wash your stinking asses!

361
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,760
Send us to prison.

362
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,840
We broke in to watch your TV.

363
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,680
It was freezing last night.

364
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,952
Down here if you want a piss!
The airport's right here!

365
00:53:55,152 --> 00:53:58,310
I'll wash your shitty,
stinking asses clean!

366
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,750
Zahed, let's go.

367
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,160
Come on, run!

368
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:23,875
This guy won't send us
to prison.

369
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,714
Understand what I'm saying,
little doggie?

370
00:54:49,914 --> 00:54:51,716
I'm talking to you.

371
00:54:51,916 --> 00:54:56,160
I told my dad to forgive Mum.

372
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:00,273
If he doesn't forgive her,
they'll kill her.

373
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:05,999
I'll really cry a lot
so he forgives her.

374
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,480
I'll tell my dad...

375
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,069
Mollah Rahman's daughter,
approach.

376
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,400
Dogs are not allowed
in prison.

377
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,716
- And me?
- You can come in.

378
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,868
Thank you.

379
00:55:31,068 --> 00:55:32,638
Zahed!

380
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,796
Look after the dog,
they won't let him in.

381
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,032
Thank you.

382
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,270
Tell Dad what you have to say.

383
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,394
Gol-Ghotai,
why are you crying?

384
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,755
Did you tell Dad to forgive Mum?

385
00:56:02,955 --> 00:56:05,240
So why are you crying?

386
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,796
Did you tell Dad
we slept rough last night?

387
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,320
Yes.

388
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,714
What did he say?

389
00:56:14,914 --> 00:56:18,719
"Don't sleep in the street.
Go to my friend's house.

390
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,080
"If he isn't there,

391
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:27,195
"tell his wife I'm in prison
and she must look after you."

392
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,074
This one?

393
00:56:50,274 --> 00:56:51,560
No.

394
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,795
No... Yes.

395
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,471
- Who is it?
- Us.

396
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,680
Who are you?

397
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,472
Zahed and Gol-Ghotai.

398
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,837
Whom do you want to see?

399
00:57:12,037 --> 00:57:13,711
Mollah Mohamad Razagh.

400
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,189
There's no such person here.

401
00:57:19,389 --> 00:57:22,118
What do you mean?
Open the door.

402
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:27,237
- Who are you?
- Zahed and Gol-Ghotai.

403
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,790
The children of Mollah Rahman.

404
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,157
Our father sent us here.

405
00:57:37,357 --> 00:57:38,679
Open up a minute.

406
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,038
- Hello.
- Hello.

407
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,477
Come in.

408
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,991
He wants to see Mollah Razagh.
What should I tell him?

409
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,638
Mohamad Razagh isn't here.

410
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,440
Where is his brother?

411
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,418
He's asking
where his brother is.

412
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:34,309
He's in an American prison.

413
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,555
Where is his wife?

414
00:58:36,755 --> 00:58:39,114
She is dead.

415
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,237
May we stay here?

416
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,237
Thank you.

417
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,558
They sent our father
to Guantanamo Bay.

418
00:59:36,758 --> 00:59:40,639
The Americans sent him.

419
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,759
Who's there?

420
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:58,949
It's us. We've come to ask you
to forgive us.

421
00:59:59,149 --> 01:00:00,200
Who are you?

422
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,994
Sir, we've come to ask
your forgiveness.

423
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,643
Why have you come back, wretch?

424
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:17,480
For the love of God,

425
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,591
let us go to our mother.

426
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,111
You called my mother a whore.

427
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:28,400
Forgive me.
You said the same to me.

428
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:31,240
What I said,
that was the truth.

429
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,317
Forgive us, Mr. Officer, sir.

430
01:00:33,517 --> 01:00:36,830
But you did call my mother
a whore.

431
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:39,872
Because she is one.

432
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:45,235
Bastard!
Your mother's the whore!

433
01:00:45,435 --> 01:00:48,955
Son of a bitch, I'll kill you!

434
01:00:49,155 --> 01:00:52,080
Son of a whore!

435
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,319
If you want to go to prison,
steal something.

436
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:00,560
If you don't feel sorry for me,

437
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,274
at least have pity on my dog.

438
01:01:03,474 --> 01:01:06,360
If you were a dog...

439
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,597
and if children
wanted to set you on fire,

440
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,200
to kill you,

441
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,119
and if a prison guard

442
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:19,357
wouldn't let you in,

443
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,111
would you think it was fair?

444
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:24,597
Stop breaking my heart,
little one.

445
01:01:24,797 --> 01:01:28,474
If you were a prison guard
earning one dollar a day

446
01:01:28,674 --> 01:01:33,120
and forbidden to allow
two children to see their mother,

447
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,932
would you think
that was fair?

448
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:40,360
If you were like us

449
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,596
and this poor dog, alone,

450
01:01:42,796 --> 01:01:47,080
without any shelter,

451
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,640
who no one will take in,

452
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:55,560
would you think that was fair?

453
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,513
Don't you feel pity for us?

454
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,680
Little one,
the laws have changed.

455
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,917
The governor won't allow it.

456
01:02:08,117 --> 01:02:11,316
A prison isn't an orphanage.

457
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,632
Do you understand?

458
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,159
I understand.

459
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,720
Gol-Ghotai, come here.

460
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:34,118
If you want to go to prison,
go and steal!

461
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,120
Come on, Gol-Ghotai.

462
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,834
If you want to go to prison,
steal!

463
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,229
She looks good.

464
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,754
Zahed, don't run!

465
01:04:41,954 --> 01:04:45,634
Let her catch us!

466
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:55,113
Don't run away!
Let her send us to prison!

467
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:02,033
Why are you stealing?

468
01:05:02,233 --> 01:05:05,120
Aren't you ashamed to steal?

469
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:09,791
If you're hungry, go and beg.
Go away! Aren't you ashamed!

470
01:05:09,991 --> 01:05:12,120
Why do you steal?

471
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,675
Go and beg, don't steal.

472
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:19,510
I begged this bread
for my children.

473
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,600
But lady...

474
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:28,157
If you take him to prison,
take me too.

475
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,358
Please, put us behind bars.

476
01:05:52,558 --> 01:05:54,789
We're not beggars.

477
01:05:54,989 --> 01:05:57,513
We are thieves!

478
01:05:57,713 --> 01:06:01,720
We stole your bread.

479
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,559
We are thieves!

480
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,631
Can't you understand?

481
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,920
What sort of person are you,

482
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,395
who won't have us arrested?

483
01:06:16,595 --> 01:06:21,036
We've stolen so much
but no one puts us in prison.

484
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,431
Eat, little doggie.

485
01:08:06,631 --> 01:08:10,800
You won't eat bread or meat.
What do you eat?

486
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,514
You'll die.
Is that what you want?

487
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,516
Eat that,
or the other dogs will get it.

488
01:08:20,716 --> 01:08:21,400
Eat.

489
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:26,833
You'll die if you don't eat.

490
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:33,151
You won't eat bread,
you won't eat meat.

491
01:08:33,351 --> 01:08:34,918
Eat.

492
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,437
What do you want to eat then?

493
01:08:37,637 --> 01:08:40,040
Do you want to die?

494
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:43,000
Eat, little one.

495
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,952
The other dogs are coming.

496
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:48,154
If you don't eat, you'll die.

497
01:08:48,354 --> 01:08:52,876
We stole this meat for you
and you won't eat it!

498
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,197
Zahed, let's run.
They're attacking us.

499
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,229
Calm down, calm down.

500
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,955
They ate up the cow's head
and we weren't arrested.

501
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:44,160
The dogs ate our cow's head

502
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:48,148
and we didn't get paid.
I'm going to get what we're owed.

503
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,190
Your dogs ate our cow's head.

504
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:03,595
You have to pay me.

505
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,629
Pay me for my cow's head.

506
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,510
Son of a whore!

507
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,475
Zahed, come on.
The dogs will eat you.

508
01:13:58,675 --> 01:14:00,880
Come on. They'll eat you.

509
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:04,436
You want to beat me?
Bastard! Shithead!

510
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,475
Son of a bitch!
Why are you hitting me?

511
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,910
Want me to fuck your stuff up?

512
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:16,113
Warder, give my mother this wood,
her cell's freezing.

513
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,639
Bring back the sacks.

514
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,320
- Hello.
- Hello.

515
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:01,876
We stole things
but no one sent us to prison.

516
01:18:02,076 --> 01:18:03,478
Carry on stealing.

517
01:18:03,678 --> 01:18:08,435
We stole bread
and a cow's head for the dog.

518
01:18:08,635 --> 01:18:12,440
They beat us
but we weren't arrested.

519
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,471
We stole lots of things.

520
01:18:14,671 --> 01:18:16,431
Go to the Park Cinema.

521
01:18:16,631 --> 01:18:18,520
They're showing a film

522
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:21,871
about a lousy thief
who gets arrested.

523
01:18:22,071 --> 01:18:23,558
Goodbye.

524
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,473
Goodbye.

525
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,309
I don't want to see
your sister here again.

526
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:49,035
We want to see this film, sir.

527
01:18:49,235 --> 01:18:51,280
It's an art film.

528
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:57,237
If you walk out halfway through,
you won't get a refund.

529
01:18:57,437 --> 01:19:00,240
We won't walk out, sir.

530
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:03,273
Just tell us what happens
in the film.

531
01:19:03,473 --> 01:19:06,280
It's all about a thief.

532
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,516
But there's no action.
It's boring.

533
01:19:08,716 --> 01:19:11,632
If you want to see a real film,

534
01:19:11,832 --> 01:19:14,877
go to my brother's cinema.

535
01:19:15,077 --> 01:19:16,956
Go on.

536
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:23,120
I go there every night,
when this bloody film's over

537
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,788
to see a real movie
before I go to sleep.

538
01:19:25,988 --> 01:19:27,831
We want to see this film.

539
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:32,200
The dog doesn't need a ticket.

540
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,709
A cinema with so few customers...

541
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:39,433
I don't know...

542
01:19:39,633 --> 01:19:41,710
Two tickets.

543
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:02,238
When there are so few customers,
one person handles everything.

544
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,589
Watch the film, little doggie.

545
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:30,798
Don't bark.
They'll throw us out.

546
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,837
Thief! Thief!

547
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,556
Bicycle thief!

548
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:08,439
- Did he steal something?
- Get back!

549
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:14,352
Officer, sir,
she's my sister.

550
01:24:14,552 --> 01:24:17,597
Come too, Gol-Ghotai.

551
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,920
I'm a thief as well.

552
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,872
Put me in prison too.

553
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,709
This isn't my mother's prison!

554
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:21,073
I want to go
to my mother's prison!

555
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:26,276
I want to go
to my mother's prison!

556
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,787
My sister will be lost,
all alone on the streets.

557
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:37,631
Lock me up
in my mother's prison!

558
01:25:37,831 --> 01:25:41,036
For the love of God!

559
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:45,240
Take me to my mother!

560
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:48,238
This isn't my mother's prison!

561
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,154
Who is it?

562
01:26:50,354 --> 01:26:52,111
It's me.

563
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:53,680
Who is "me"?

564
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:56,474
I'm the bicycle thief's sister.
