1
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,838
Mom!

2
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,404
What happened?

3
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,966
Alley! Alley! Alley!

4
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,374
Oh, my God!

5
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,470
God, Alley!

6
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:33,025
Oh, God. God.

7
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:40,363
I warned you, Marco.
I fuckin' warned you.

8
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,960
I told you
not to sell him drugs.

9
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,885
It was the summer of '58.

10
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,159
The year the Dodgers
left Brooklyn.

11
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,927
The summer
Dion and the Belmonts...

12
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,231
were blasting
out of every car radio...

13
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,965
and the summer
that I first fell in love.

14
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,666
It was the summer
Marco Vendetti...

15
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,005
came home from prison...

16
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:27,411
and the streets of Sunset Park
ran red with blood.

17
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,177
My brother Leon started a gang
called the Deuces...

18
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,449
after our brother Alley died.

19
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,423
Our job
was to protect the block.

20
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,323
-Leon.
-Hey, Fritzy.

21
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,885
-You need anything?
-I'll let you know, kid.

22
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,022
But it was a local mob guy
named Fritzy...

23
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,624
who really ran
the neighborhood.

24
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,602
He pretended to be
everybody's best friend.

25
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,730
Get yourself an ice cream.

26
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:55,297
But he was only in it
for himself.

27
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,768
Scooch. Center field.

28
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,892
On the corner of Sixth Street
and Second, the Deuces ruled.

29
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,123
Hey, Pops.
Grandson gettin' better?

30
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,188
He's good.

31
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,598
-Hey, what?
-Aw, it's horrible.

32
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,625
We hung out at a candy store
called Willie's...

33
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,833
where we ran bootleg cigarettes,
illegal fireworks...

34
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,171
and did a little bookmaking
on the side.

35
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,268
Hey, we had to make a livin'.

36
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:34,246
Aw, come on. They're playin'
like little girls here.

37
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,077
What, did he throw it
underhand?

38
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,549
Oh, Scooch. We're havin' fun.

39
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,348
Ah, the Dodgers lost again.

40
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,081
The usual, Scooch.

41
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,612
I told 'em. They ain't gonna
win in Los Angeles.

42
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,147
They shouldn't have left
Brooklyn.

43
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:47,955
Come on, I never seen 'em cry.

44
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:51,691
The last game,
they wept like a baby.

45
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,164
How are you?

46
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,666
Go on. Fuck the Dodgers.

47
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:59,161
Fuck Pee Wee, fuck Jackie,
and fuck the fuckin' Duke.

48
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:02,368
Don't say that, Tommy! Don't
say, "Fuck the fuckin' Duke."

49
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,309
Hey, listen. Everybody knows
he signed your friggin' glove.

50
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,337
Get over it. They left.

51
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,712
I ain't rootin' for 'em
no more.

52
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,444
'cause you're
a fair-weather fan.

53
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,042
Oh, come on, now.
Let's go outside.

54
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,486
Let's go outside now.
I'll see ya later.

55
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,489
What's this?

56
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,923
Bridesmaid's dress.

57
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,551
Pink taffeta.
You like it, huh?

58
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,061
You know what I like you in.

59
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,961
Who's gettin' married?

60
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,627
My cousin Antoinelle,
out in Bayridge.

61
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:29,794
You're comin', right?

62
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,236
Another cousin gettin' hitched?
How many more are there?

63
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,968
People do get married, Leon.

64
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,669
It is somethin' people do,
you know.

65
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,701
Willie, is it suddenly
gettin' hot in here or what?

66
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,645
Oh, so what do you
want to do tonight?

67
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,116
-You know this fuckin' kid?
-Who?

68
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,016
-This kid.
-Who's he?

69
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:50,022
Hey, asshole.

70
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,048
You know whose turf this is?

71
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,855
This is Deuces turf.

72
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,054
You fuckin' listenin' to me?

73
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:59,189
Ah, me deaf! Ah, me deaf!

74
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,530
-Shut the fuck up!
-I'm deaf!

75
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,398
-Leon.
-What?

76
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,165
Come here. There's a fight.

77
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,504
Fuck! Fuck!

78
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,032
What are you doin'?

79
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,443
This kid
was disrespectin' our turf.

80
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,415
I think he's one of them
Garfield boys or somethin'.

81
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,941
This ain't a Garfield boy.
He don't hang with no peewees.

82
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:24,480
This is Betty Ann's little
brother--her deaf brother.

83
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,755
Nate. Big guy. Go home.

84
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,995
You hit one person a year,
it's a deaf kid.

85
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,899
Well, how the fuck
am I supposed to know?

86
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,770
His mother should hang a sign
around his neck or some shit.

87
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,136
Father Aldo, we're up here.

88
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:54,346
Father. Thanks, bud.

89
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,058
You missed a spot.

90
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:05,124
Hey, Father. You wanna
come up here and help me?

91
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,291
That's your penance.

92
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,504
I hear Marco Vendetti
is comin' home soon.

93
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:25,114
I thought you should know.

94
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,119
Give me your word
nothing's gonna get outta hand.

95
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,959
Give me some more
of that polish, Scooch.

96
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,881
You know the first thing I'm
gonna do when I get outta here?

97
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,082
I'm gonna get me
a nice cold beer...

98
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:07,855
a slice of sicilian,
a nice piece of ass...

99
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,591
and find that rat motherfucker
who sent me here.

100
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:20,637
I'm gonna slice his
motherfucking throat...

101
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,402
from ear to ear.

102
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,571
Mark the son of a bitch.

103
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:45,423
Not bad, huh?

104
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:50,061
-It's not bad.
-It looks all right.

105
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,997
Who put this on the window?

106
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,498
Carnival. Not bad.
It's gonna be a good spot.

107
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,772
-A good spot, yeah.
-Make us some money.

108
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,336
-Make us some money, yeah.
-Philly Babes.

109
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,541
Get away from here.

110
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,312
-Where's Leon?
-What's it to ya?

111
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,046
He told Mikey Festo
he was gonna break his head...

112
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,417
if he rented out
the store over here.

113
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,217
-So?
-Let me ask you somethin'.

114
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,689
Since when
did he become the landlord?

115
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,954
Since yesterday.
You didn't read the paper?

116
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,429
Tell your brother
we're movin' in over here.

117
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,623
You or any of your guys...

118
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,632
try to stop any of my guys,
and you're dead.

119
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,396
Over my dead body are you gonna
move junk into this building.

120
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,801
Whoa.
Who said anything about junk?

121
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,963
We're talkin' about
a little numbers action...

122
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,202
some broads, Mario Lanza
on the jukebox. Relax.

123
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,142
Don't tell me to relax,
you son of a bitch.

124
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,271
Watch your mouth,
you little prick.

125
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,644
Come on.

126
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,952
Go hang out
with the other girls.

127
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,922
There ya go, ya punks.

128
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,584
They're runnin'.

129
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,683
Squeal, pig!

130
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,157
How do you like them apples,
fat ass?

131
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,360
You boys all right?

132
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:33,532
Do I look like
I'm all right, you moron?

133
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,801
Get me outta here.

134
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,274
Help me get this guy
outta here.

135
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,744
Hey, Bobby.
Let's get outta here.

136
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,709
Beautiful.

137
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,053
It smells good in here, mom.

138
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,859
It's comin' from next door.

139
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,397
Well, what are we
supposed to eat?

140
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,600
I started to make
the cacciatore.

141
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,164
You know, it was
my Alley's favorite.

142
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,506
The onion made me cry.

143
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,034
What about makin'
my favorite, ma?

144
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,478
It's a dish called food.

145
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,572
I'm fuckin' starving.

146
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,948
Watch that mouth!

147
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,680
What you talk like that
to me for?

148
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,588
-Hey, ma. What's goin' on?
-Nothin'. No dinner.

149
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,421
If you would take the money
we give you...

150
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,893
and spend it on food
instead of fuckin' booze...

151
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,361
we would have
some fuckin' supper!

152
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,988
No! You gotta buy food!

153
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,862
Hey! You're talkin'
to your mother like that!

154
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,059
Get outside.

155
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,902
Now!

156
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,242
I can't take it anymore.

157
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,677
Don't worry, ma.

158
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,682
I'm gonna go to the corner.
I'll get somethin' to eat.

159
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,212
What?

160
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,413
What's the matter
with you, huh?

161
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,615
There's been a truce
on this block for three years.

162
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,783
Did I tell you to break it?

163
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,622
They were disrespectin' you.
What am I supposed to do?

164
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,186
Droppin' bricks off the roof?
What are you, fuckin' crazy?

165
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,720
Cinder blocks--they're bigger.

166
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,892
Oh, it's just a game to you,
huh, Bobby?

167
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,298
I gotta answer to Fritzy
for this.

168
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,461
One of those guys might die.

169
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,028
What's Fritzy
got to do with this?

170
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,802
Nobody moves in Sunset Park
without his OK. You know that.

171
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,002
So you're just gonna let 'em
move in?

172
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,035
You lost your fuckin' balls
or somethin'?

173
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,447
You don't run the Deuces,
I do.

174
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,280
And I don't back down
from nothin'.

175
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:29,082
There will be no junk
on this block, ever.

176
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,918
Now, we're gonna do it my way.

177
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,754
If I ever hear you talk to
our mother again like that...

178
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,728
I swear to God, I will crack
your fuckin' head open.

179
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,843
Hey, I'm here to see Fritzy.

180
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,041
Thanks.

181
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:11,019
Get this kid
somethin' to drink.

182
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,963
What do you want,
a soda or somethin'?

183
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,260
No, thanks.

184
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,496
You know...

185
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,834
bricks don't fall
out of the sky...

186
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:23,035
in this neighborhood
unless I'm throwin' 'em.

187
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,201
You understand?

188
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,801
Yeah, Fritzy.

189
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,774
Now, Philly Babes
is one thing...

190
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,147
but his car?

191
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,751
That really got me angry.

192
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,984
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

193
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:44,155
I'm gettin' calls
from Mikey Festo.

194
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,721
Who are you
to strong-arm anyone?

195
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,603
There's no disrespect to you,
Fritzy.

196
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,731
He's gonna rent the store
to Philly and his crew.

197
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,968
They're gonna deal junk
out of there.

198
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,339
If I ever hear that word out of
your mouth again in my club...

199
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,851
that'll be your last word.

200
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,013
This ain't your block.

201
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,754
We all know what happened
to your brother Sal.

202
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,424
-I'm sorry for your...
-Alley.

203
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,661
What?

204
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:27,570
His name was Alfonse Michael.
We called him Alley Boy.

205
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:28,766
Alley Boy.

206
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,777
We're all sorry
for your loss...

207
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,048
but he was a little junkie,
wasn't he?

208
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,982
Wasn't he?

209
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,183
Yes or no.

210
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,096
Look...

211
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:02,201
Mikey Festo
doesn't own that store.

212
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,175
I do...

213
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,235
and I'm gonna do
whatever I want with it.

214
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,178
So mind your own business.

215
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,909
Wear your jacket,
sing your songs...

216
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,577
do whatever the fuck it is
that you kids do.

217
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,415
Just stay out of my way.

218
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,157
Alley Boy.

219
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,041
You movin' in?

220
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,349
That's smart.
You're a clever boy.

221
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,985
Where'd you live before?

222
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,015
President Street.

223
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,788
Yeah? Always there?

224
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,198
Before that, I crawled out
from between my mother's legs.

225
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,699
You got any more questions?

226
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,835
What, are you just gonna
stand there...

227
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,304
or are you gonna help me?

228
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:10,502
That's Vipers territory.
I'm a Deuce.

229
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:14,876
-Douche?
-That's--that's funny.

230
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,644
Come on.
It's just a line in the street.

231
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,310
Not to me. I'm sorry.

232
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,621
You're a real Prince Charming,
you know?

233
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,385
Give me that.

234
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,155
Here.

235
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,291
It's heavy.

236
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,856
Thanks.

237
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,200
Hey, Bobby, come here.

238
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,402
I'm talkin'.

239
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,035
Get up here, now.

240
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,816
Hey, Annie.

241
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,957
She's nice, right?

242
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,027
The little fox
with the ponytail?

243
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:15,165
They ain't foxes.
They're the Velvets.

244
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,168
Do you know
who I was just talkin' to?

245
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:23,204
Yeah. That's Annie--
Annie the ice cube.

246
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,546
What do you know about her?

247
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,610
She's Jimmy Pockets' sister.
That says it all.

248
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,418
What? They're related?

249
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:35,655
See, I told you we should have
killed that bastard.

250
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:38,458
You stay away from her.
We got enough trouble.

251
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,503
Hey, I just saw you
out the window.

252
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:55,741
What the hell you talkin'
to that Deuce for, huh?

253
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,976
None of your business.

254
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,646
Look, everything in my house
is my business.

255
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,484
Could you give me a hand
with these boxes?

256
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,046
They're kinda heavy, you know.

257
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,386
You're such a helpful brother,
Jimmy.

258
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,918
Hey, I let you live
in my house, right?

259
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,363
You wanna live on the streets,
that's fine with me.

260
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,661
I catch you talkin'
to that Deuce again...

261
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,826
you're outta here.

262
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,733
Take that crazy mother of yours
with ya.

263
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,762
She's your mother, too, Jimmy.

264
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,902
Come on.

265
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,079
Ma, come on. Ma,
what are you doin'? Please.

266
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,622
I'm sorry, OK?

267
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,991
A pepperoni pie. Table 4a.

268
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,592
-You're terrible.
-I am terrible.

269
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,227
I'm starvin', though, too.

270
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,173
I don't know.

271
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,540
She's hot.

272
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,104
She couldn't be
as hot as this pizza.

273
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,842
What do you got,
the red line to hell in there?

274
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,042
Is it the same one again?

275
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,211
-Hi.
-How are you?

276
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,278
That's terrible!

277
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:13,155
She looks like...

278
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,127
-Do I have dough on my face?
-No, you're good.

279
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,721
Oh, my God.

280
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,231
You can't go crazy, right?

281
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,970
You again?

282
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,529
Are you here
to take our orders?

283
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,700
Yeah, what do you want?

284
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,800
I want you to take it
on the arches.

285
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,472
What?

286
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:38,176
Get outta sight. Scram.
You know, disappear?

287
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,144
So listen, um...Annie.

288
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,849
How'd you know my name?

289
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,551
I know a lot of things.

290
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,093
So, anyway,
I was wondering...

291
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,495
What were you wondering,
wonder boy?

292
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,923
Are you going to the feast
on Friday night?

293
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,697
Who's asking?

294
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:04,637
Well, I mean, I'm probably
gonna be there, so...

295
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,735
-Where's our pizza?
-I don't know.

296
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:10,214
Have they cooked it?
I mean, I'm dying.

297
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,240
You're still here?

298
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,876
Why is he still here?

299
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,018
All right.

300
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,230
Hey, I think he's cute.

301
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,299
He's all right.

302
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,931
So how'd you do?

303
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,304
She likes me.

304
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,955
I'm here to see Marco Vendetti.

305
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,546
Right over there.

306
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,954
-What the fuck happened to you?
-The Deuces.

307
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,759
The punks ambushed me when
I was checkin' out the club.

308
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,265
I'm lookin' over my shoulder
everywhere I go now...

309
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,425
paranoid as a fuck.

310
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,662
I got a limp that's gonna be
with me the rest of my life.

311
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,364
There goes your dancing career.

312
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,463
-Yeah, that's funny.
-No, it's not.

313
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,133
You're an embarrassment.

314
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,439
If you weren't my cousin,
I'd break your other arm.

315
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,001
I'm sorry.

316
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,037
You'd better get that club,
Philly.

317
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,982
I got big plans for that spot.

318
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,985
It'll be ready. I promise.

319
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,850
All right. Don't mess this up.

320
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:59,288
Get me a sit-down with Fritzy.
Tell him Marco wants to see him.

321
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,382
Why?

322
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,019
Just shut up and do what I say.

323
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:06,861
Look at you.
You're fuckin' pathetic.

324
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,332
Come on, Vendetti.
Time's up.

325
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,741
Tell the Vipers to crush
them fuckin' Deuces, all right?

326
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,709
We gotta answer for this.

327
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,644
Yeah, nice to see you, too.

328
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,445
You know what I'd do to her,
Dommy?

329
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:26,951
You'd boff her, Jack?

330
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,351
Yeah. You know how good, Dommy?

331
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,083
Really good, Jack.

332
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,525
-Where do these girls live?
-France.

333
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,655
France. Where's that?

334
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,290
I think you take the "F" train.

335
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,393
The "F" train.

336
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,994
Oh, good God.

337
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,506
They got Elvis.
Goddamn, what's next?

338
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,007
Yeah, I got more peachfuzz
on my balls...

339
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,202
than he's got on his head.

340
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,268
I wouldn't shave my head
if they attacked my bedroom.

341
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,280
Looks like my gym teacher.

342
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,340
-Hey, how's it goin'?
-Got any deliveries?

343
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:00,180
Well, gimme a box.

344
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,948
-Dad, get me a pretzel.
-Oh, shut up.

345
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,548
You're like your mother.
Always got your hand out.

346
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,581
Money don't grow on trees.
How much?

347
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,821
-Twenty cents.
-Daddy, please.

348
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,728
When I tell you to shut up,
you shut up.

349
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:13,924
Leave him alone.

350
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:19,164
Hey, do yourself a favor and
mind your own fucking business.

351
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:22,833
This is my kid.
I do with him what I want.

352
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,899
That's because of you.

353
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:28,402
Leon, stop! It's OK!
It didn't hurt!

354
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,915
Don't touch him again.
He's a good boy.

355
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,075
Get outta here.

356
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,608
-Bunch of punks.
-Get outta here!

357
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,489
You want a pretzel?
Come here.

358
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,064
A little mustard
on the pretzel?

359
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,068
All right.
You go home to your mother.

360
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,799
Thanks, Leon.

361
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,342
Oh, my God.

362
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,814
Come on. Come on. Come on.

363
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:08,748
Guys!

364
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,023
Holy shit. There must be
fifteen of 'em over there.

365
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,652
I never knew
they had so many guys.

366
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,255
All right. Fuck this shit!

367
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,699
Unh! You crazy?

368
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,169
Come on!

369
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:48,158
Get outta here!
Get off the street!

370
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:51,162
I guess
we're goin' to war, huh?

371
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,562
Well, that's what happens when
you all do somethin' stupid.

372
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,725
Well, maybe
it's for Marco's homecoming.

373
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,099
Look, it don't make
any fuckin' difference.

374
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,400
You gotta listen to what
I'm tellin' you--no fightin'.

375
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,997
Yeah, just chicken out, right?

376
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,008
Aw, come on.
What do I look like, Leon?

377
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,237
I say we beat
their fuckin' brains out.

378
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,870
What, are you deaf?
What did I just say?

379
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,847
Leon, they challenged us.

380
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,371
Why are you goin' soft on me?

381
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:12,644
Watch it, Bobby.

382
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:13,878
All right. You know what?

383
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,546
You guys wanna be pansies,
that's fine...

384
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,111
but I'm gonna have
no part of it.

385
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,457
I need a little time to think.

386
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,725
Go to the feast.
Just stay cool.

387
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,527
That's all I'm askin'.

388
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,651
Hey, I hear the Vipers
are gunnin' for you.

389
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,814
Yeah, so what else is new?

390
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:54,348
You want my guys ready? I mean,
in case you come up short.

391
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,723
I'm just here for the babes,
Freddie.

392
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,490
Oh, right. The babes.
Well, look...

393
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,861
we're there for you
if you need us, OK?

394
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,763
The word is you'll need us.

395
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,234
They got an army, you know?

396
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,601
-See ya, chief.
-Yeah, see ya.

397
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,730
You got some change?

398
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,241
Thanks.

399
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,302
Place your bets.
Place your bets.

400
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,050
Hey, feelin' lucky?

401
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,953
Oh, fancy meeting you here.

402
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,753
So, what number
you gonna put your money on?

403
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:30,893
Fifteen.

404
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,920
You must be feeling lucky.

405
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:34,795
That's 100-to-1 shot.

406
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,095
I always go for the long shot.

407
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,340
Hi, handsome.

408
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,289
You sure you don't wanna go
to the feast, Leon, huh?

409
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,491
I been to that feast
twenty times already.

410
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,726
What am I gonna win,
another kewpie doll?

411
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,736
I got me a kewpie doll.

412
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,237
Come here.

413
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,911
You like me, don't you?

414
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,177
Well, I feel sorry for ya.

415
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,149
There's a difference.

416
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,982
Yeah, that's why you were
up all night screamin' my name.

417
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,750
I must have been
havin' a nightmare.

418
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,817
Talk about a nightmare, livin'
in that house with your brother.

419
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,021
You don't know the half of it.

420
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,429
You know, he labels the milk
so no one else can drink it...

421
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,558
and then he spends
the whole day in the bathroom...

422
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,660
shootin' skag
and drinkin' beer...

423
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,330
and then he thinks
drinkin' a glass of milk...

424
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,702
is gonna keep him healthy?

425
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,172
He's crazier than my mother.

426
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:52,040
You think that's crazy,
you should see my house.

427
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,688
Hello, Jack.
Hey, where you goin'?

428
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:12,427
Hey, Jackie.

429
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,557
Hey, don't touch me.

430
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:25,201
Please don't touch me.
Please stop. Please.

431
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,676
We just wanna talk to you.

432
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,078
Hey, put 'em up!

433
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,608
Put his arm out! Come on!

434
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:42,722
Oh! We got a winner, huh?

435
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,592
Which one you want,
little lady?

436
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:45,926
Uh, that one.

437
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,556
-This one?
-Yeah.

438
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,362
-There you go.
-Thanks.

439
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,100
They jumped Little Jack!

440
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:05,371
-Hey, somebody get the guys!
-Somebody get some help!

441
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,611
Jack, you OK?

442
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:13,082
Hey, Bobby. Bobby, man,
they jumped Little Jack.

443
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:14,682
They jumped him, man.

444
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,128
-Take it easy.
-He's all right.

445
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,098
The Vipers jumped me
in the park.

446
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,535
Oh, I'm gonna kill 'em!

447
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,539
All right. Cool it. Cool it.
We gotta get Leon.

448
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,268
Hey, Scooch, you know where
Betsy's baby-sittin'?

449
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:33,368
Go tell Leon it's going down
in the park. Go!

450
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,072
Bobby, man,
you want my guys now?

451
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,273
Yeah, all you can bring.

452
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,282
All right, man. You can
count on us. We'll be there.

453
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,307
Let's get these motherfuckers!

454
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:43,343
-They jumped Little Jack.
-Call an ambulance.

455
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,289
-Guys, come on!
-No more fightin', Bobby!

456
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,757
I'm sorry.

457
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,953
I didn't do anything wrong.

458
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,343
I'll get it. I'll get it.

459
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:52,814
-Leon.
-What's wrong?

460
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,654
The Vipers jumped Little Jack.
Come on, hurry up.

461
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,717
-Where?
-The park.

462
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,426
Hey, where's Freddie?

463
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,329
He's dead if he don't show.

464
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,334
No way, Moof, not us.

465
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,802
-Let's do it.
-Let's fuckin' do it.

466
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,751
You gotta be kiddin' me.

467
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,782
Little Bobby.
Where's your brother?

468
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:04,886
Don't worry, he'll be here,
you fuckin' grease monkey.

469
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:08,990
He ain't comin', fuck-putz.
What do you got, huh?

470
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,297
Look at him. He's a punk.

471
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,998
Come on!

472
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,138
Motherfucker!

473
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,805
Get him off me!

474
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,183
Motherfucker!

475
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,488
It's over.

476
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,723
It's fuckin' over.

477
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,773
Gotta run!

478
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,970
Let's get the fuck out of here!

479
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,312
Bobby, are you all right?

480
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,588
Can you get up?

481
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:46,885
Give me a minute.

482
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,789
Is he gonna be OK?

483
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:51,351
Come on! We still got
more coming! Let's go!

484
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:57,093
Bobby, what happened, man?
It started already?

485
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,501
What are you talkin' about?
It's already over.

486
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,296
Man, you guys
are somethin' else.

487
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,206
Where the hell were you?

488
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,846
The Bulls! Scatter!

489
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,144
Let's scatter!

490
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,031
Alley?

491
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,028
Alley Boy?

492
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,836
It's Leon, ma. It's Leon.

493
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,504
Go get him.

494
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,645
It's OK, ma.

495
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,016
It's OK.

496
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,162
Oh, God.

497
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,571
God, that hurts.

498
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:49,102
Stop fidgeting, wonder boy.

499
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,978
Stop being such a baby.

500
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:53,743
There we go.

501
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,445
Is that Christmas music I hear?

502
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:01,015
What the hell?
It's, like, 115 degrees.

503
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:04,050
My mom has a thing for
Christmas music, that's all.

504
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,926
Don't pay no attention to it.

505
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:16,438
What has Leon told you
about me, anyway?

506
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,772
What'd he say?

507
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,277
-Nothin'.
-Nothin'?

508
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,775
I bet he told you
I was a slut, right?

509
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:28,444
No, nothin' like that.

510
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,420
He just said you were cool.

511
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:35,749
That's the trouble with guys.
They lie.

512
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:38,489
Big fat fuckin' lyin' mouths.

513
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:42,021
We wish you a merry Christmas

514
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:44,967
Hey, you want to see something?

515
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,993
What?

516
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,528
Come with me.

517
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,407
Where you goin'?

518
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,435
Just follow me.

519
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,916
You know, you don't have
to be embarrassed.

520
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,927
Embarrassed about what?

521
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:13,060
About your mother.

522
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,156
Mine's no prize.

523
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,963
You shouldn't say that...

524
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:21,267
'cause she's your mother.

525
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,432
You always gotta
take care of her.

526
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:27,877
Yeah, but it's gotta go
both ways, too.

527
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,403
She doesn't give a shit
about me.

528
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:35,975
What was your brother like?

529
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,829
He was kind of a dreamy kid,
you know?

530
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,499
He started out,
he just had a little habit.

531
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:58,099
But then he got strung out.

532
00:37:58,142 --> 00:37:59,541
Leon went to Marco and Jimmy...

533
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:03,343
and said,
"Stop givin' my brother junk."

534
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:07,581
But they kept--
they kept giving it to him...

535
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:10,086
so he beat the hell
out of 'em...

536
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:15,616
and then one day, they--they--
they gave him a hot shot.

537
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,184
They killed him.

538
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,429
I'm sorry.

539
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,298
I didn't know that.

540
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,703
Now you do.

541
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:37,346
Hey, Bobby, you know what?

542
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:38,541
What?

543
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,542
I love my bear.

544
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:46,384
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I do.

545
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,606
Leon, listen to me.

546
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:09,238
Little Jack
was in the hospital all night.

547
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,771
Put an end to this
before somebody gets killed.

548
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,743
What do you want me to do,
Father?

549
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:20,587
You were fightin', too.

550
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,821
I want you to talk to the boys.

551
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,160
They listen to you.
I want you to make peace.

552
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,224
I don't know. I think you're
talkin' to the wrong guy.

553
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,769
Look out for the whale, man!

554
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,046
Deuces rule!

555
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:51,917
-Hey, Little Jack.
-My boys.

556
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,754
-Welcome back.
-Look who it is.

557
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,885
-How'd it go?
-Hey, we threw 'em a bing.

558
00:39:56,927 --> 00:40:00,090
We ain't gonna be seein'
no Vipers for a while, trust me.

559
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,031
How you feelin'?

560
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,432
A lot better than I look,
I hope.

561
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,902
Hey, thanks for stickin' up
for me last night.

562
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,165
Don't mention it.

563
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,969
-We're Deuces, right?
-Right.

564
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,498
Hey, Jack, go put your feet up.

565
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,374
Hey, it's hot out here.

566
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,539
Best-looking guy out here.

567
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:53,776
Hey, who's that broad
from last night?

568
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,649
That's Annie,
Jimmy Pockets' sister.

569
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:57,586
What's he doing over there
with the enemy?

570
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,418
What do you think he's doing?

571
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,495
Hey, Marco. Welcome home.

572
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,370
What's the matter?

573
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:20,002
You know how long
I been waitin' here?

574
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,842
I don't know. Fifteen minutes?

575
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,280
I've been waitin' three years
and fifteen minutes.

576
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,613
Get the fuck in the car.

577
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,117
Right.

578
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,023
Here's your beer.

579
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:42,460
You take care of them Deuces?

580
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,934
Yeah, we fought 'em.

581
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:49,431
You gonna tell me what happened,
or I gotta read your mind?

582
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:51,168
It went down just like you said.

583
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,971
We were destroying them,
and then out of nowhere...

584
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,571
Leon shows up,
and then it gets bad.

585
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,809
You're tellin' me one guy
took on our whole crew?

586
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,908
Yeah. He went crazy.

587
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:05,752
Shut up. Goddamn, do I gotta
do everything myself?

588
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,223
-Where is he?
-How should I know?

589
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:11,592
Ask Father Aldo.
He's gonna make him a saint.

590
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,996
Jesus don't listen
to no snitches.

591
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,837
From now on,
I want you to tell me...

592
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:24,602
every fuckin' move he makes,
you understand me?

593
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:28,738
It's good to see you, Marco.

594
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,382
Oh, there he is.

595
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:41,755
The cavalry
and his lovely tomato.

596
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:45,353
-Great last night, Leon.
-Like the old days.

597
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,421
Hey, guys, don't egg him on,
all right?

598
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:50,433
-How you feelin'?
-Like a million dollars.

599
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:53,436
Leon, you gotta teach me
how to fight like you.

600
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,937
What are you talkin' about,
Scooch?

601
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,803
You're gonna be the new
center fielder for the Dodgers.

602
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,705
You're takin'
Duke Snider's spot.

603
00:42:58,742 --> 00:42:59,902
Come on.

604
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:08,375
Come here!

605
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,649
Don't go.

606
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,849
-He's callin' me.
-What are you, a dog?

607
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:16,883
-No.
-Then let him come here.

608
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,918
What if he has something
important to tell me?

609
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,726
Well, you can let him
tell you here.

610
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,392
-Bobby!
-What?

611
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,163
Bobby, what's wrong with you?

612
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:27,500
Go on to your brother,
puppy dog.

613
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,032
I'll be right back.
Don't go nowhere.

614
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,049
What'd I do this time?

615
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:42,143
I wanted to tell you you did
the right thing last night.

616
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,086
I did?

617
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,681
Yeah, they jumped Little Jack.
What were you supposed to do?

618
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:49,090
-You mean you're not mad?
-I ain't mad.

619
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,924
You didn't shoot anybody.
I'm fuckin' thrilled.

620
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,725
All right.
Can I enjoy my day now?

621
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:31,166
Oh, hey, welcome home, Marco.

622
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:32,964
I fixed up the house
like you said.

623
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:36,598
-Good.
-Ohh. The neck, man. The neck.

624
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,541
Don't worry. They'll be swimmin'
in their own blood in no time.

625
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:40,941
Hey, get the drapes.

626
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:46,181
Hey, welcome home, daddy-o.
How you doin'?

627
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:48,275
-Good. How'd you get that?
-Fuckin' Deuces.

628
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:50,445
How's my good friend Leon
doing?

629
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:52,284
Dead,
when I get my hands on him.

630
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:55,382
You know how I can get to him?

631
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:57,326
Yeah, you remember
that little kid Scooch?

632
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,762
-What the fuck's a Scooch?
-That drunk asshole Gino's kid.

633
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,494
Leon's like a father
to that little mutt.

634
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,665
-Good shot.
-Good to see you.

635
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,764
Come here.

636
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:12,002
Do me a favor.
Get me a bicycle.

637
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,806
-What for?
-Just do what I say.

638
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,875
What are we gonna
tell everybody, huh?

639
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:22,215
Tell 'em I fell off a ladder
in church.

640
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:25,449
Well, at least your eye
matches your suit.

641
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,286
You really want to go
to this thing?

642
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:30,088
Yeah, Leon, come on.

643
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:32,095
All right. Let's go.

644
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,332
Hey, Scooch. Nice bike.

645
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:51,175
-Yeah, you like the bike?
-Yeah.

646
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,274
Yeah, it looks good on you.

647
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:08,022
-Scooch, get over here.
-Stay right there.

648
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:09,623
Why don't you come over here
and get him?

649
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:13,568
Well, come on, then. Let's see
what happens, motherfucker.

650
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,196
Stop! What are you doin'?

651
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,730
I'm gonna cut you a thousand
times, you know that?

652
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,868
One for every day you left me
in that fuckin' cage.

653
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,378
You come by my block again,
and I'll fucking kill you!

654
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,073
This ain't your block no more.

655
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,809
Just get off me!

656
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,813
It's good to see you, Leon.

657
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:44,424
Why didn't you say good-bye
to me at the pool?

658
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,232
-You was busy.
-No, I wasn't.

659
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:48,795
Well, if you wasn't busy,
then why didn't you come...

660
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:49,999
and say good-bye to me?

661
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:53,840
Can we talk about this outside,
please?

662
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:58,738
I'll see you later.

663
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,290
Are you ever gonna grow up,
or are you just gonna spend...

664
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,916
the rest of your life
in Leon's shadow?

665
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:10,551
Hey, I ain't
in no one's shadow.

666
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:11,720
Really?

667
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:13,696
Look, let's get
something straight.

668
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,255
If you want to be with me,
then be with me.

669
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,291
I want to be with you.

670
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,065
Well, you sure don't
act like it, you know?

671
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:23,766
Stop bein' ashamed of me,
especially in front of Leon.

672
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:25,672
You gotta take my hand.

673
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:29,702
You gotta put your arm
around my shoulder, you know?

674
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:31,577
Boyfriend-girlfriend stuff.

675
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:35,245
Well, let's make it real.

676
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:40,613
-You mean it?
-I'm serious as a heart attack.

677
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:43,626
You really want me
to be your girl?

678
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,252
Yeah. Right now.

679
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:49,896
What would you do
if I was your girl?

680
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:51,924
Well...

681
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,103
I would hug you...

682
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:59,465
and I would kiss you...

683
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:03,468
and then I would climb
the empire state building...

684
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:05,606
and tell the whole world
that you were my girl.

685
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:09,016
I would say, "Everybody,
Annie is my girl now!"

686
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:17,555
Marco.

687
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:19,186
My cousin Philly
said you had something...

688
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,198
you wanted to talk to me about.

689
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:26,032
Heroin.
I got an unlimited supply.

690
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,536
What are you, fuckin' stupid?

691
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,038
You know
I don't deal that stuff.

692
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:32,667
You don't have to. I'll do
all the dirty work myself.

693
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:34,301
What's in it for me?

694
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:37,211
You front me the cash,
I'll triple your money.

695
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,612
I'll think about it...

696
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:44,052
but if this comes back to me
in any way, I don't know you.

697
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,681
That's why we're not having
this conversation.

698
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:49,248
There's just one more thing.
There's these Deuces.

699
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,090
This fuckin' kid Leon.

700
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:52,561
I want your permission
to take him out.

701
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,291
Whoa, whoa. Slow down.

702
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:57,129
You just got out of jail.

703
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,533
Besides, I don't want him
to get killed on my block...

704
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:01,594
you understand?

705
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:03,469
It's bad for business.

706
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,746
You don't know who I am,
do you, mister?

707
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,476
I don't care who you are,
sonny.

708
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:14,143
The lady said
she didn't want to go.

709
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:16,311
It's lucky for you
you're not packin' a gun.

710
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:27,291
You could've at least said
something to her at the pool.

711
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:29,322
Like what? Congratulations?

712
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:31,834
Welcome to the family?

713
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:33,529
She ain't a Viper, Leon.

714
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:36,403
She didn't even go
to Marco's welcome home party.

715
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,773
As a matter of fact, she took
care of me after the rumble.

716
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,209
She took care of me good.

717
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:44,543
She's Jimmy Pockets' sister.
End of story.

718
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,276
It's not the end of the story!

719
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,715
Her family killed your brother.

720
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:49,548
You remember that?

721
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,779
Yeah, well you can't fuckin'
stop me from seein' her!

722
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,816
Oh, yeah?
What are you gonna do?

723
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,919
I'll do whatever the fuck
I want to do!

724
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:01,430
-You're not my father, Leon!
-You want out, Bobby?

725
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:04,263
-What are you talkin' about?
-You want out of the gang?

726
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:05,768
'Cause that's what
you're askin' for.

727
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:08,498
Leon, I am always behind you.

728
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:09,766
You want me to cut
Jimmy Pockets...

729
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:11,467
into a million pieces?
I'll do it.

730
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,375
You want me to kill
fuckin' Marco? I'll do it.

731
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:17,471
But Annie's my girl now...

732
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,244
and you're just gonna
have to accept that.

733
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:42,735
Listen up.

734
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,071
Some things are gonna change
around here.

735
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:47,838
No more nickel-and-dime
bullshit on the corner.

736
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,368
Anybody wants to get high
in Brooklyn...

737
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:51,278
they're gonna come
to the avenue first.

738
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:55,148
We're gonna need runners,
lookouts, baggers--

739
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,380
I'm the fuckin' taste-tester.

740
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:59,582
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now.

741
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:03,616
No crooks, no cops,
and no motherfuckin' Deuces.

742
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,595
Am I wrong, Willy?
I mean, tell me.

743
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:09,997
The kid's ridin' a Trojan horse.
I don't trust her.

744
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:11,261
Love.

745
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:17,766
Somethin' I just can't explain.

746
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:21,676
You just gotta let it--
let it take its course.

747
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:24,111
It's his life. Salud.

748
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,217
You all right?

749
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:40,790
Punk.

750
00:51:57,247 --> 00:51:58,942
I gotta go out there.

751
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:00,472
Don't be stupid.

752
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,935
Listen, man,
we gotta do something.

753
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,778
I mean, if they smell
blood, weakness...

754
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:07,942
they're gonna hit us harder.

755
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:11,943
And if it's not the Vipers,
it's gonna be somebody else.

756
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:13,649
We gotta show ourselves.

757
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,121
That's my opinion.
It's your gang.

758
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:19,753
What do you want to do?

759
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:22,424
I don't know.

760
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:24,160
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

761
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,928
What is Bobby doing?

762
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:04,839
Hey, you just gotta
give him some space...

763
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,364
learn to trust him.

764
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:09,643
I don't trust her.

765
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:27,823
There's something
about the ocean.

766
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:29,695
What about it?

767
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:31,257
I don't know.

768
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:32,996
It relaxes me.

769
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:37,902
It makes me feel
like I belong here.

770
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,967
You do--with me.

771
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:44,708
Hmm. I think the move
is to get out of here.

772
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:49,344
-We just got here.
-No, I mean Brooklyn.

773
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:51,377
I've been thinking about it
a lot, you know...

774
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:53,150
especially after
what happened to the block.

775
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:55,487
Where you gonna go?

776
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:59,054
I don't know.

777
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:01,859
Someplace nice...

778
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:03,263
where it don't snow.

779
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:08,995
Where you can lie on the beach
like this all year-round...

780
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,507
where the air don't stink.

781
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:13,236
Like Miami, maybe.

782
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:15,710
How do you know the air
don't stink in Miami?

783
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:18,043
'Cause I seen pictures.

784
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:20,242
How can you tell
what a place smells like...

785
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:21,841
by looking at pictures?

786
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:24,786
You can just tell, that's all.

787
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,288
I'd go to Los Angeles.

788
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,723
Why Los Angeles?

789
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:30,248
See the Dodgers.

790
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:35,455
I wonder
what those guys are doing.

791
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:39,059
Pee Wee, Koufax, the Duke.

792
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:41,229
I wonder if they miss Brooklyn.

793
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,968
I won't miss it.

794
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,874
I'm getting the hell
out of Brooklyn.

795
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:51,540
Well, you're not going anywhere
without me.

796
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:55,774
You serious?
You'd come with me?

797
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:57,446
Today, if you want.

798
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,785
Leon would never let you go.

799
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:04,927
-Stop it! Put him down!
-What are you doing?

800
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:08,920
-Shut up!
-Let him--let him fucking go!

801
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:12,394
Stop!

802
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,066
Where's your brother now,
Bobby, huh?

803
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,937
Leave him alone,
you pieces of shit!

804
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:20,272
You know what they do to
tough guys like you in the can?

805
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,676
Pass you around
like a dirty magazine.

806
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:26,238
Makes the pages all sticky.

807
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:29,115
Let me go!
Jimmy, make 'em stop!

808
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:32,145
Handle your fucking sister.

809
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:33,951
Take your fucking hands
off her!

810
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,116
Shut up!

811
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:37,217
You know, Bobby, your brother
screwed this whore...

812
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,751
in a pay toilet
on President Street.

813
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:43,459
Told you not to hang out with
that Deuce, you fucking whore!

814
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,832
Hey, stab him, Marco!

815
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,562
Have a nice day, Bobby.

816
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,664
Let me go!

817
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:52,834
Go lay down
next to your boyfriend.

818
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:55,777
Bobby, are you all right?

819
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:57,973
Tell Leon I'm coming.

820
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:00,141
He better get out of my way.

821
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:10,993
Thanks, Marco.

822
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:15,061
Can I ask you a question?

823
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,463
Of course.

824
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:24,832
-You with me?
-You know I am, Marco.

825
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:28,603
Then what the fuck's
your sister doing...

826
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:30,442
hanging out with a Deuce?

827
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,209
I knew you were gonna
ask that question.

828
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:34,842
It's--it's all part of my plan.

829
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:36,977
Remember you said
keep an eye out on Leon?

830
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,680
Well, what better way?

831
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:50,294
Just don't let me down, Jimmy,
all right?

832
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:07,747
Come on, punk.

833
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:10,719
We know you sold the drugs
to Alley.

834
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:16,358
I'm not the one you want.

835
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:20,192
I'll give you everything
on Marco Vendetti.

836
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:22,630
He's the one you want.

837
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,325
Nice girl.

838
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:00,825
Mind your business.

839
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,531
How many people
in this building you think...

840
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,836
are looking at your
naked girlfriend right now?

841
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:11,346
She's got a good body, though.

842
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,905
Not bad.

843
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:39,707
Were you ever with her?

844
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,471
Who, Annie?

845
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,408
Nobody could get near her.

846
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:51,384
Look, Bob, she's your girl.

847
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,652
Do what you want with her.
Just be careful.

848
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:57,125
I will.

849
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,821
Promise.

850
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:00,624
I'm always here for you.

851
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:02,654
You're my brother.

852
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,978
What happened to you?

853
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:23,149
I had a run-in with Marco
at the beach.

854
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:26,212
I was gonna tell you earlier,
but I was embarrassed.

855
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,449
He said he's coming for you.

856
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:35,221
Come here.

857
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:37,459
It's not bad.

858
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:51,974
Promise me
if anything happens to me...

859
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:54,950
you'll get ma out of here.

860
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,509
I love you, Bobby.

861
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:59,544
I love you, too.

862
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:04,416
I miss him, you know.

863
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:12,758
I miss him, too.

864
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:47,694
Hey, Marco, this is that guy
Maurice I was telling you about.

865
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:49,671
Hey, how you doing?
Nice to meet you.

866
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,903
Sit down.
Did you bring the stuff?

867
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:55,035
Yeah, I got it.
Got my money?

868
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,147
What happened to him?

869
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:08,484
It's there.

870
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:11,186
-Who's the tester?
-Me.

871
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,855
How'd I know?

872
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,091
Tell me what you think.

873
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:19,158
What the fuck are you doing?
Sit down. Sniff it.

874
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:26,069
That's some really good stuff.
It's the best stuff in Brooklyn.

875
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:28,134
I guarantee it.

876
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:30,441
Yeah, it's good, right?

877
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,970
You can step on that thing
ten times...

878
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:34,574
it'll still take you
out to deep space.

879
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:38,144
-Deep space.
-Goes a long way.

880
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:39,620
So, we done here?

881
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,221
Yeah. Yeah, we're done.

882
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:47,087
I'll be back in two weeks
with the rest of the wake.

883
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,564
All right?

884
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,726
You boys have a good afternoon.

885
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,760
And as for you, James,
take it easy.

886
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:01,971
Stow it.

887
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:06,612
Come on, get the fuck up
and help me.

888
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:08,640
Put the money under the sink.

889
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:10,845
There's a loose floorboard
under the litter box.

890
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:14,217
Come on, let's go.

891
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:18,219
There we go.
Shut the fucking thing.

892
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:31,666
Jingle bells

893
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:33,572
Hey, ma? Ma, you in there?

894
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:39,607
You in there?

895
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,139
Can you see this?

896
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:43,675
Will you just lay off her?

897
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,522
-You are such a loser.
-Oh, I'm a loser?

898
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,252
Yeah, you're a loser.
You've always been a loser.

899
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:50,691
You think I'm
some small-time jerk-off?

900
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:52,717
-Yeah, I do.
-Well, you're wrong, all right?

901
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:53,956
I'm with Fritzy now.

902
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:56,658
-Who's Fritzy?
-Who's Fritzy?

903
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:57,927
Fritzy owns the neighborhood,
all right?

904
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:00,959
He gave Marco and Philly
forty large in a paper sack.

905
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:03,130
You're looking at a gangster.

906
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:08,943
Tree.

907
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:14,008
You never thought
I'd amount to nothing, did you?

908
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:19,546
So, what do they do
with the money...

909
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:21,113
they put it in the bank?

910
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:23,125
Nah, they don't trust no banks.

911
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:25,218
He's got it in a very
secret place in his house.

912
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:26,819
It's shh-shh!

913
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:35,028
Here, Jimmy, have another beer.

914
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,744
Where's Leon?
I gotta talk to him.

915
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:45,679
My mother's afraid
to leave the house.

916
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:49,585
Saw him at the apartment
with Betsy.

917
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:51,177
Jesus,
what are you talking about?

918
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:54,155
We got a rumble going on,
he's at home getting laid?

919
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:56,488
He must be taking pussy lessons
from Little Jack.

920
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:58,857
Screw you, Moof.

921
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,157
Why don't you
leave him the fuck alone?

922
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:01,561
Look, when we started
this gang, all right...

923
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:03,326
we made a vow to Leon
to protect the neighborhood...

924
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:04,526
and we're not.

925
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:06,827
I don't know about you...

926
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:08,530
but I'm willing to kill
for what's ours.

927
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,062
We're all family here.

928
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:13,371
You gotta talk to him, Bobby.

929
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:16,071
This stuff with Marco's
getting out of control.

930
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,650
Come on, Leon.

931
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:36,326
I'm not in the mood.

932
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:38,458
I'll make you feel better.

933
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:46,038
What's the matter with you?

934
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:48,270
My head's all filled up.

935
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:50,404
I'm sorry. It's not you.

936
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:54,075
Fine. You want to be alone?
I'll leave.

937
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:57,017
I didn't say that.
Where you going?

938
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:59,351
Home.

939
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:01,083
I'll walk you.

940
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,216
-I can walk myself.
-I'll walk you.

941
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:06,251
I mean, I don't know what's
gotten into you lately, Leon.

942
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:10,664
When you are ready
to fool around, call me, OK?

943
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:47,333
Can I talk to you for a second?

944
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:50,703
l, uh, got a little confession
to make.

945
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:57,275
The whole time that I was away,
I was thinking about you.

946
01:06:57,313 --> 01:07:00,009
-I gotta go, Marco, come on--
-Listen to me.

947
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:01,812
I changed in there, I did.

948
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,217
You know?

949
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:07,416
I just--I just wanted
something sweet in my life.

950
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:08,787
That's all.

951
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:11,019
Someone like you.

952
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:14,291
Marco, I am with Leon, OK?

953
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:18,262
-Let go of me!
-You like that?

954
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,562
What are you doing?

955
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:42,588
You know...

956
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:46,719
I think I know...

957
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:48,593
a way we can get out of here.

958
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:50,861
I have a plan.

959
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,993
Oh, yeah? What's that?

960
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:55,868
Take Marco for all his money.

961
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:59,068
-You serious?
-I'm serious.

962
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:02,475
He's got all this money
stashed somewhere.

963
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:05,674
He thinks
no one will ever find it.

964
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:06,942
But I...

965
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:10,342
know where it is.

966
01:08:13,522 --> 01:08:15,149
I need your help.

967
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:19,353
Will you help me, Bobby?

968
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:22,387
Yeah, of course.

969
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:41,948
What happened to you?

970
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:46,051
Baby.

971
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:48,454
What happened?

972
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:51,016
Who did this to you? Who?

973
01:08:56,398 --> 01:09:01,199
What did he do to you?
What did he fucking do to you?

974
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:03,137
Oh, fuck! What did he do?

975
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:06,903
I am gonna fucking kill him.
He is fucking dead!

976
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:09,911
What's going on?
Is everything all right?

977
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:11,412
Get out of the way!
Get out of--

978
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:15,884
-No, Leon, stop!
-God damn it!

979
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:17,749
Oh, my God.

980
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:19,481
Baby, what happened?

981
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:21,319
Oh, sweetie.

982
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:28,961
That's four bad hands
in a row.

983
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,488
Hey, Vinnie, you dealing
from the bottom of the deck?

984
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:32,467
You vampires ever take a break?

985
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,332
I'm trying to concentrate
over here.

986
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:36,395
Oh, shut up, stupid, all right?
I'm down over here.

987
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:38,838
Ain't my dealing, Babes.
You just got shit luck.

988
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:50,041
What the fuck, are you crazy?

989
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:51,518
-Where's Marco, huh?
-I don't know!

990
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:54,785
-Where is he?
-I don't fucking know!

991
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:57,053
Yeah, well, tell him
he's fucking dead.

992
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:04,796
Boat yard, midnight.

993
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:06,960
You tell him
to fucking be there.

994
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:18,379
-Who is it?
-It's Joey.

995
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:23,175
How you doing, Miss Esther?
Is Leon home?

996
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,618
Leon didn't come home
last night.

997
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:26,052
Really?

998
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:27,214
What do you want?

999
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:28,689
Fritzy wants you.

1000
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:31,659
Now.

1001
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:37,832
Don't worry, ma.
I'll be home soon.

1002
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:46,368
I thought we talked.

1003
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:51,669
-You said you understood me.
-I do.

1004
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:54,376
-You do?
-Yeah.

1005
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:58,111
By aiming a moving car
like a guided missile...

1006
01:10:58,153 --> 01:11:00,121
through the front
of Philly Babes' joint?

1007
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:01,850
Well, that don't
tell me that you do.

1008
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:04,017
Look, Fritzy,
this is between me and Marco.

1009
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:07,661
Marco's with me now...

1010
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:10,529
so there's gonna be
no more of this bullshit.

1011
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:12,591
It's time for you two fuckers
to grow up.

1012
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:16,127
No more Vipers,
no more Deuces...

1013
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:19,163
no more aces, no more
fucking kings and queens.

1014
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:23,104
I can't do that. I'm sorry.

1015
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:28,111
Get Marco in here.
Get him in here.

1016
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:36,851
Look, Marco, come in.
Come here.

1017
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,959
Now, I want you two guys
to shake hands.

1018
01:11:40,996 --> 01:11:44,625
You're gonna be neighbors
from now on.

1019
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:46,464
So shake and
get the fuck out of here.

1020
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:47,992
Find out if one of those fucks
outside...

1021
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:50,232
can make me
a decent manhattan.

1022
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:04,477
Hey, did you hear what I said?

1023
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:09,288
Shake his hand now.

1024
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:15,592
How's my sweet
little Betsy doing?

1025
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:19,857
Take it fucking easy!
Not in the club, asshole!

1026
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:22,393
Not in the fucking club.
What's wrong with you?

1027
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:23,564
Why don't you kill
all the kids?

1028
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:25,630
-Get him out of here.
-Huh, Fritzy? Kill 'em all.

1029
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:28,302
How do you sleep at night,
you fuck?

1030
01:12:32,448 --> 01:12:34,143
I'll take care of him.

1031
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:50,094
Will you tell her
to turn down the music?

1032
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:51,497
It's driving me crazy!

1033
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:52,795
Back off.

1034
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:05,441
-Ma, I said turn off the music!
-You get off her!

1035
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:08,541
I swear to God, I'll slit
your throat, you piece of shit.

1036
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:10,779
You never raise your hands
to her, never!

1037
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:13,049
-You're fucking nuts.
-Get the fuck out of here!

1038
01:13:13,088 --> 01:13:15,283
You're both nuts! And you,
you didn't hear Santa Claus.

1039
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:17,622
It was that fat Irish bastard
upstairs.

1040
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:20,560
-It was Santa.
-Santa don't exist, ma!

1041
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:23,030
-It was Santa.
-You're fucking nuts!

1042
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:24,896
Shut up and
get the fuck out of here!

1043
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:28,334
It was Santa, it was Santa!

1044
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:32,204
Don't you listen to him.
Of course there's a Santa, ma.

1045
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,835
He just don't come to Brooklyn
no more.

1046
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:43,549
Where the fuck have you been?

1047
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:45,018
I've been looking
all over the place for you.

1048
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:47,180
Word is you went crazy
at Fritzy's place.

1049
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:48,712
Don't worry about that.

1050
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:52,022
I need all the guys.
Round 'em all up.

1051
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:53,823
What's going on?

1052
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,193
It's going down tonight.

1053
01:13:58,066 --> 01:13:59,863
Do you want me to talk to
some of the Ocean Side boys...

1054
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:01,335
see if I can't get
a couple of .22s?

1055
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:03,668
-No.
-Are you sure?

1056
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:07,004
I said no.
Get all the guys down here now.

1057
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:08,202
Go, Bobby.

1058
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:11,975
Hurry up.

1059
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:17,508
What's up, Marco?

1060
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:20,716
What happened with Fritzy?
He give the OK?

1061
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:22,553
The saint crucified himself.

1062
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:29,061
Round up the guys. The rat
goes down here right now.

1063
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:30,689
I've been waiting three years
for this.

1064
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:31,926
You got it.

1065
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:05,426
What's the matter?

1066
01:15:09,805 --> 01:15:12,933
Bobby, I can't take it anymore.

1067
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:16,843
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

1068
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:20,748
I know. Me, too.

1069
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:24,747
So let's do the job tonight.

1070
01:15:27,222 --> 01:15:28,519
I can't tonight.

1071
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,991
We gotta fight the Vipers
tonight.

1072
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:37,088
The guys need me.

1073
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:38,292
All right.

1074
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:44,470
Well, you make
your decision, OK?

1075
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:48,135
You think real hard, because
I am getting out of here.

1076
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:51,805
I've gotta--I've gotta
get the fuck out of Brooklyn!

1077
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:55,146
Do you understand?
I can't take it anymore!

1078
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:58,641
I gotta get my mother
out of here!

1079
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:06,924
What are you doing here?

1080
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:10,495
I don't know, l--

1081
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:12,523
I saw all the guys. l--

1082
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:15,993
You should be at home, in bed.

1083
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:17,596
I don't want to wake up
tomorrow morning...

1084
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:19,834
and find out
that you're dead, Leon.

1085
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:22,810
I can't do this right now,
Betsy.

1086
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:24,641
I need some time.

1087
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,648
You don't have to do this
for me.

1088
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:29,651
I've got a bad feeling, Leon.
I'm scared.

1089
01:16:29,685 --> 01:16:30,913
I love you.

1090
01:16:30,953 --> 01:16:32,853
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you, OK?

1091
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:36,722
If you love me,
then you'll understand.

1092
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:39,056
Now go.

1093
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:41,062
Go on.

1094
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:43,587
Will you call me later? Huh?

1095
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:44,792
Go.

1096
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:02,509
So I went to see
Tommy Esposito.

1097
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:04,542
He looked at me
like I was crazy.

1098
01:17:04,586 --> 01:17:06,281
Said it was a suicide mission.

1099
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:08,084
Yeah, yeah,
and I went over to see...

1100
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:09,852
Sally Black
and the Blue Knights...

1101
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:11,017
and he laughed at me.

1102
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:15,223
He said the word on the street
is we're a dead gang.

1103
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:18,426
Freddie better show
with his guys, so help me God.

1104
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:22,335
Maybe somebody ought to buy
the dumb Polack a watch, eh?

1105
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:25,772
He ain't gonna be late.
He knows this is serious.

1106
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:27,468
Where's Bobby?

1107
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:29,101
He'll be here.

1108
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,011
What time is it?

1109
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:34,379
It's 11:00.

1110
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:58,055
Wait here for me.
Pipe it.

1111
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:33,467
Hey, Philly, man, what the fuck
happened to your car?

1112
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:35,231
I thought
you just got it fixed.

1113
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,204
Another wise-ass.

1114
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:39,366
You all right?
You're sweatin', man.

1115
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:42,035
You're with us now.
Now, hurry to the boat yard.

1116
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:43,704
All right. All right, Babes.
All right, all right.

1117
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:44,871
Come on.

1118
01:19:44,913 --> 01:19:46,175
All right, guys, come on.
You heard him.

1119
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:49,240
To the boat yard!

1120
01:20:16,678 --> 01:20:18,646
Listen, I gotta go warn Leon.

1121
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,581
Go hide the money
and meet me at the boat yard.

1122
01:20:21,616 --> 01:20:23,379
Fuck.

1123
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:31,082
Motherfucker!

1124
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:38,692
Mother!

1125
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:46,707
You punk! You dick!

1126
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:48,709
You scumbag!

1127
01:20:58,019 --> 01:21:01,420
Jimmy Pockets,
you rotten piece of shit!

1128
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:03,686
Piece of shit! Motherfucker!

1129
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:07,126
Piece--Come on!

1130
01:21:07,162 --> 01:21:09,426
Motherfucker. Motherfucker.

1131
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:12,830
Piece of shit!

1132
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:14,028
Mother!

1133
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:18,803
Jimmy Pockets, you rat!

1134
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,308
You rat! You motherfucker!

1135
01:21:24,412 --> 01:21:26,437
Guys, relax. It's Scooch.

1136
01:21:29,184 --> 01:21:31,209
I wanna fight with you guys
tonight.

1137
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:32,982
Scooch, why don't you
get outta here?

1138
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:34,454
Come on. I can do it.

1139
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:36,650
No, you can't.
You're too little. Now go.

1140
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:39,558
-I can help you.
-No! Now go.

1141
01:22:01,383 --> 01:22:03,408
Well, if it ain't
the sharp and shiny Deuces...

1142
01:22:03,451 --> 01:22:05,009
ready for some action.

1143
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:07,385
Freddie, thanks for showin' up.

1144
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:09,583
We're here. We're with you,
right, fellas?

1145
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:12,149
-When are these pricks coming?
-Midnight.

1146
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:14,024
I'm ready to slice
some Viper skin.

1147
01:22:19,067 --> 01:22:22,059
-Hey, Bobby, where you been?
-Hey, Bobby, what's goin' on?

1148
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:25,334
-Hey, Freddie, how's it goin'?
-Good, man.

1149
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:27,273
Yo! What the fuck?

1150
01:22:27,309 --> 01:22:29,072
This motherfucker
made a deal with Philly!

1151
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:30,236
Are you sure?

1152
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:32,041
I'm tellin' you,
he tried to fuckin' set us up!

1153
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,775
You boys
runnin' with Philly, huh?

1154
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:38,883
-Motherfuck!
-Get outta here!

1155
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:44,456
Heads up. Marco's here.

1156
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:53,694
Fuck!

1157
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:16,490
You like fuckin' my sister?

1158
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:18,652
Come on!

1159
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:17,377
Jimmy Pockets,
you motherfucker!

1160
01:25:17,412 --> 01:25:20,347
You fuckin' dick motherfucker!

1161
01:26:02,123 --> 01:26:04,114
You were there for me tonight.

1162
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:07,155
I'll always remember that.

1163
01:26:11,432 --> 01:26:13,491
I'll see you tomorrow.

1164
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:15,969
Good night, Leon.

1165
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:17,699
Good night, pal.

1166
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:34,915
Hey, Leon, Fritzy warned you.

1167
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:48,097
You shoulda listened, kid.

1168
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:21,035
Mom!

1169
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:23,469
Oh, my God.

1170
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:29,365
My God! No!

1171
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:36,043
Today we say good-bye
to Leon Anthony.

1172
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:38,177
May he never be forgotten...

1173
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:42,349
neither in God's eyes
nor our own.

1174
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:44,756
Amen.

1175
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:48,694
There were a lot of funerals
in Sunset Park that week--

1176
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:51,130
Marco, Jimmy Pockets...

1177
01:27:51,165 --> 01:27:52,996
and of course my brother Leon.

1178
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:56,199
It seemed the war between
the Deuces and Vipers...

1179
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:57,704
was finally over.

1180
01:27:59,674 --> 01:28:00,766
Love you.

1181
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:05,637
Unfortunately, my mother
paid the highest price.

1182
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,114
She lost two sons.

1183
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:11,141
We decided
it was best for her...

1184
01:28:11,185 --> 01:28:13,449
to go live with my uncle
on Long Island.

1185
01:28:13,488 --> 01:28:16,855
She'll be better off with
someone to take care of her.

1186
01:28:28,569 --> 01:28:31,834
I'm gonna come visit you
out there, Bobby.

1187
01:28:31,873 --> 01:28:35,274
Maybe we'll go look
at a Dodgers game or somethin'.

1188
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:37,540
Yeah, we'll do that.

1189
01:28:37,578 --> 01:28:39,603
I hear there's a lot of
nice-lookin' broads out there.

1190
01:28:39,647 --> 01:28:41,979
Maybe you could
send us a couple, huh?

1191
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:47,652
Hey, don't forget about us
out there.

1192
01:28:47,689 --> 01:28:49,452
Deuces forever, right?

1193
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:51,151
That's right.

1194
01:28:55,229 --> 01:28:56,696
Take care, Bobby.

1195
01:28:56,731 --> 01:28:58,221
All right, Bobby.

1196
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:02,033
See you later.

1197
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:06,638
That day was the last time...

1198
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:09,609
we were all together
as the Deuces.

1199
01:29:09,644 --> 01:29:11,077
Eventually street gangs...

1200
01:29:11,112 --> 01:29:13,979
disappeared
from the neighborhood.

1201
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:17,473
Life in Sunset Park
would never be the same.

1202
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:18,815
Listen...

1203
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:21,947
give this to Father Aldo.

1204
01:29:21,989 --> 01:29:23,889
He'll know what to do with it.

1205
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,920
Go on.

1206
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:37,000
Here.

1207
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:38,198
I want you to use it.

1208
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:41,402
The Duke signed it.

1209
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:42,602
Thanks.

1210
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:49,612
Take care of the block,
all right, kid?

1211
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:52,448
You're gonna come back, right?

1212
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:54,717
Of course I'm gonna come back.

1213
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:03,152
You be good.

1214
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,560
Don't cry.

1215
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:25,981
Annie and l, we were going out
to Los Angeles...

1216
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:27,647
to start a new life together...

1217
01:30:27,688 --> 01:30:30,816
and we were takin' her mother
with us.

1218
01:30:30,858 --> 01:30:34,487
Oh, yeah. There was one more
thing I forgot to mention.

1219
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:36,019
What do you feel like eating?

1220
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:38,961
Lasagna.

1221
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,991
With who?

1222
01:30:41,035 --> 01:30:42,798
Let's go to Ricardo's.

1223
01:30:42,837 --> 01:30:43,997
Excellent.

1224
01:30:47,742 --> 01:30:51,178
There was no way I was gonna
let my brother die in vain.

1225
01:30:51,212 --> 01:30:55,649
Like Leon said, "There will be
no junk on this block, ever."
