are you looking at?

[ Vicky ]
Obviously, Lucy's only
been with us a short time,

669
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:55,439
so it's hard to ascertain
a full picture.

670
01:12:55,472 --> 01:12:58,174
But this is the first time
she's been placed in
a children's home,

671
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:02,446
and I think that's proving
one of the hardest things
for her to settle in.

672
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:04,648
There hasn't been
much continuity.

673
01:13:04,681 --> 01:13:06,483
But she is vulnerable
because of her age.

674
01:13:06,516 --> 01:13:09,085
And we need to put in
some guidelines, some rules.

675
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:14,157
Um, and I think
that's one of my main concerns
and priorities for Lucy.

676
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:18,562
So, another thing that I think
is quite important would be
to get her into a school.

Because I think
she's missing school.

678

Also, perhaps for Lucy
to maybe speak to a counselor...

679
01:13:23,667 --> 01:13:26,002
or a child psychologist
on a weekly basis...

680
01:13:26,035 --> 01:13:28,538

Lucy and I have spent
a bit of time together,

01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,042
and one thing
that's come out of that is...

01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:37,013
that I've tried to put
into place that she is
vulnerable because of her age.

* My eyes are blind

* The fire that drove me on

* Is nothing more
than dust and ash *

927
01:42:53,835 --> 01:42:57,805
* The day my friend was gone
