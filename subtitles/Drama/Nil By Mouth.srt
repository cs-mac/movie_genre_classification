1
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,062
Can I have a drink, mate? Mate?

2
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,395
Can I get served here, mate?

3
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,500
Can I have a drink?

4
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,229
Yeah...

5
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:17,308
I want-- Can I get two--? No, three.
Three pints of lager. And...

6
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,608
Three vodka tonics
and a drop of scotch.

7
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,908
Half a lager and lime.

8
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,554
Three vodka tonics, yeah.
Slice of lemon in them.

9
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,554
And put an olive in that.

10
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,358
You got a tray, mate? Yeah?

11
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,194
A tray?

12
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:50,236
No, I want half a lager.
Half a lager.

13
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,944
Yeah, lager and lime.
That's right.

14
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,578
How much?

15
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,919
Ain't you got no ice?

16
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,900
You got no ice?

17
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,379
- Hello, Joe. How are you?
- Hello there.

18
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,595
Tom?

19
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,788
Tom, do the lights.

20
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,269
Evening, everyone.

21
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,507
What a miserable-looking lot.

22
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,472
Fucking cheek!

23
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,472
- Well, I'm back.
- Yeah.

24
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,171
- Are you pleased to see me?
- Yeah.

25
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,043
- Serious?
- Yes!

26
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,480
Thank you.

27
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,390
What do you think of the tan?

28
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,293
All right? It's all over.
It's not bottle, it's all over. It's all over.

29
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,194
Except for the carrots and onions.
I covered them up...

30
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,201
...because you never know, the hole in
the ozone. You know, what they say?

31
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:31,037
But I go to France every year,
and I don't know why I go...

32
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,235
Oh, here he is, look.

33
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:39,848
- Did you fucking pick them olives?
- Do you want to drink it or wear it?

34
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,318
- You seen Gus and Paula?
- No. Probably in the other bar.

35
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,218
I'll give them a shout
if I see them.

36
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,224
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back in a minute.

37
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,884
Where you going with all them?

38
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,826
Talk to the geezers.
What's with you?

39
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,734
Oh, yes.

40
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:11,481
Round of applause for our emcee,
Dave. Give it up for him.

41
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:17,352
Where you been? We've been sitting
here with our tongues hanging out.

42
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,422
I'm fucking melting here.
Look at me.

43
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:23,453
Getting them their fucking drinks.
She's driving me fucking mad, she is.

44
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,791
I was just telling him
about that Deborah.

45
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,465
- Remember Deborah?
- Deborah?

46
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:32,128
- That fucking sort. Right good-looking.
- Oh, the bank bird.

47
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:36,002
- So, anyway, I get to the door, right?
- That's if it's true.

48
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,648
I ring the bell, right?
I'm standing there, I'm waiting, right?

49
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:46,648
There's a geezer standing there
in a see- through woman's negligee.

50
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:50,277
He's got all the fucking tackle
hanging out. He's stark naked.

51
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:54,085
- He's got a great big la-di-da.
- Yeah, one at both ends.

52
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,319
Yeah, but the cigar was bigger.

53
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,394
He says,
"Hello, you must be Mark.

54
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:02,898
My wife, Deborah, told me about you.
Drinks are in there, party's in there."

55
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,900
And he's pointed at these doors.

56
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:08,905
What you call them doors
in the fucking cowboy films?

57
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,542
- Them doors.
- Louver doors.

58
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:14,074
Louver doors, right?
So all of a sudden I'm stand--

59
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,742
- Very sorry, mate.
- All right, mate.

60
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,484
Cunt. Wants to sit in me fucking lap,
doesn't he?

61
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,456
Anyway, so I go through
these louver doors...

62
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,593
...and you ain't gonna believe
what I've seen.

63
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:33,431
There's eight or nine couples,
all bang at it. It's an orgy.

64
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,159
It's only turned out to be
a fucking orgy.

65
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,169
There's assholes going up and down,
there's tits everywhere.

66
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,864
It's like watching a bluey, right?
I'm thinking:

67
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,600
"I'm having some of this,
this is a bit of me."

68
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:47,712
So I strip down, right?
Strip down to me boxer shorts...

69
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,680
...sat down on the sofa, picked up an
album cover, and I start rolling a joint.

70
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,978
Tell him about the bird
bending over with the big Earthas.

71
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:59,318
There's a bird standing next to me.
She's leaning over the sofa.

72
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,154
She's got the biggest pair of tits
you've ever seen.

73
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:03,727
They are like that, right?

74
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,490
I'm thinking,
"I'd like to get hold of that."

75
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:12,298
I look around, she is getting a severe
portion up the fucking Gary, right?

76
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,573
The bird looks down at me
rolling the joint, and she said:

77
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:20,201
"Oh, no. It ain't gonna be one
of those parties, is it?"

78
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,709
- You all right?
- Only heard that 20 times.

79
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,878
And you'll hear it 20 fucking
more times, it's early yet.

80
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,498
Hello, Tone, it's Bill.

81
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:53,543
Oh, I'm all right, mate.
Yeah, what's going on?

82
00:06:56,682 --> 00:07:00,584
We've fucking been waiting here
for an hour already, mate.

83
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,688
You turned your phone off.
You know what I mean?

84
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,894
Come on, mate. You can't have--
You should've said--

85
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:13,463
That's bollocks.
Tone, for fuck's sake, man.

86
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,236
You fucking left us hanging
in the lurch.

87
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,038
We're fucking shriveling up.

88
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:25,269
Give us a bang on your beer, mate.
I'm fucking gasping. Good man.

89
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,943
Fucking hell, that's nice.

90
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,981
Enjoy that. Cheers.

91
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,711
Your phone's been off
for a fucking hour, man.

92
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,049
Do you know what I mean?

93
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,216
Tone, for fuck's sake, mate!
You're fucking us about!

94
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,158
We've been waiting here
for an hour for you.

95
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,491
- Tell him to hurry up!
- I'm telling him!

96
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,166
Tell him to be quicker!

97
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:53,397
All right? Come now, yeah.
Blinding, all right.

98
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:58,340
Yeah, it will only take you 10 minutes,
then you can go do your other thing.

99
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,503
Okay, mate. All right, yeah. Ciao.

100
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,181
Getting me more and more.

101
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,113
Can I have another bang on that?
He's winding me up.

102
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,116
- He's coming now.
- When?

103
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,948
- He's coming down.
- That's definite?

104
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,352
- Yeah.
- You're not fucking me about, are you?

105
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,159
The drugs are arriving!

106
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,193
- You dropped me off at the airport.
- Wednesday.

107
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,963
I'm in bits.
I mean, we've caned the fucking gear.

108
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,868
So I chop one up,
sling it up me fucking hooter.

109
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:32,305
- I thought you said we was out.
- It was a bit of personal.

110
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,539
What's he like, a bit of personal?
You're fucking murder.

111
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,307
It was a bit of personal.

112
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,862
There they are. Paula, here!

113
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,691
Murderous, all day in traffic
to get here.

114
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,629
- You should've been here at 7.
- Tell me about it.

115
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,292
We took a cab to Catford.
There was an accident.

116
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:02,066
Traffic was whack, all down
to one lane for nearly a fucking hour.

117
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,176
- Roadwork all the way, as usual.
- Do you want a drink?

118
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,868
- No, thanks.
- I want one.

119
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,510
- Tone, you all right?
- All right.

120
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,747
- All right. It's good, yeah?
- Yeah, you got two here?

121
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,358
- I'll get one. You want a ton?
- Yeah.

122
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,859
- You got two bits here.
- I want the bit of Bill as well.

123
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,328
- That's the good one?
- Yeah, you got both.

124
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:30,094
- It's clean, right?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah, listen.

125
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,761
Listen, one more thing. When you
phone me, don't scream and shout.

126
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,067
You don't know
who could be listening.

127
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,574
If I say I'm gonna be there,
I'll be there.

128
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,874
Don't pester me, all right?
All right, have a good night.

129
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,048
I just said it was the devil's music.

130
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,717
Then I bought a country-western
album, and I played it backwards.

131
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,558
You know what you get when
you play it backwards?

132
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,327
You get your wife back,
your house back, your kids back.

133
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,067
Now don't fucking patronize me.

134
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:14,470
Sorry about that. I'm a free-reiner.

135
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,975
Bill? Billy?

136
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,984
- All right, Bill?
- How's it going, mate?

137
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,919
- Did you get that there thing?
- Yeah, yeah.

138
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,657
- Your family's over there.
- Me mum?

139
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:33,161
- Yeah, do you want a drink?
- No, I've got to go somewhere.

140
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,824
- Listen. Still on for Sunday?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

141
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,800
He's a mate.
I can't be fucked about.

142
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:42,730
- It's a nice little earner, Bill.
- And you're in your whack.

143
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:46,105
Yeah, I know. Lovely.
I'll probably see you tomorrow.

144
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,973
Listen.

145
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,672
- Stay off that gear.
- All right.

146
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:54,114
Because this is important.
There's a nice few quid involved.

147
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,349
All right, mate.

148
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,253
- When is it?
- Sunday.

149
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,026
When?

150
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,492
Sunday.

151
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,925
All right, away you go.

152
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:16,438
- All right, see you later, mate.
- See you later, Bill.

153
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,809
Am I a cunt, or am I a cunt?

154
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,706
- Is he all right?
- Yeah, he's on that fucking gear.

155
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,644
Sean Connery making toast.

156
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,292
Yes.

157
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,488
Maybe I'll have two slices.

158
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,865
You look anorexic. The best
way to wind up an anorexic is...

159
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,562
...tap them on the shoulder and go,
"You putting on weight, you fat cunt?"

160
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,873
Did I tell you I only shag
homeless women?

161
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,568
So much easier to get them
to stay the night.

162
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,738
And after you fuck them,
you can drop them off anywhere.

163
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:15,026
So he gets up to his turn
to go to the screw.

164
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:19,729
He goes, "Good morning, I'll have egg
and bacon, tomato and fried bread."

165
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:23,066
- What, he thinks he's in a hotel?
- He's always stronging it.

166
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,575
So the screw looked at him,
and he went, "No, egg or bacon."

167
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,008
- What?
- Yeah, right?

168
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,707
So he went, "I'll have egg and bacon
and--" And he went, "No, no, no.

169
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:36,911
You can have egg or bacon." He went,
"You're having a fucking laugh, cunt."

170
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,613
- It's egg and bacon.
- Yeah.

171
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,190
- It's always been.
- Right.

172
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,760
- Like salt and pepper, knife and fork.
- Horse and cart.

173
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,726
Fucking all that bollocks.

174
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,196
- Hello, stranger.
- All right?

175
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,007
About fucking time.

176
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,074
- You all right?
- Yeah. Give us a kiss.

177
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,480
- Had a bath?
- No.

178
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,554
I didn't think so.
You don't look soapy.

179
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,554
Crunch. Hits the screw
in the eye with the egg.

180
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,627
- All right, mate?
- All right, Bill?

181
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:21,163
All right, Mark. Hello, my little darling.
What are you doing?

182
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,301
- Bill.
- Huh?

183
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,562
- You get that parcel?
- It's on the table.

184
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,898
- By the...
- Yeah.

185
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,597
- You missed dinner.
- That's all right. I'm not hungry.

186
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,936
- Mom out?
- She's in the loo. Do you want tea?

187
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,611
Yeah, lovely. Two sugars.

188
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,610
- Danny?
- Got orange juice?

189
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,841
- No, I've got Ribena.
- Yeah, lovely.

190
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,182
I'll have a cup of tea.
What am I, a spade?

191
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:47,348
The screw's gone over.
Well, it's fucking kicked right off...

192
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,586
...because they're all waiting
for someone to fucking start.

193
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,628
It's took a London boy to kick it off.

194
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,596
- Who's this?
- This is Micky Tyne.

195
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:59,568
You wouldn't remember him.
He's a bit more my age, you know.

196
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,865
And he was a fucking lunatic.

197
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,770
Right, so he hasn't even
been there a fucking day.

198
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,606
He hasn't got through breakfast,
and he's caused a riot.

199
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:12,183
So he's down on the block. He ain't
gonna see London for three stretches.

200
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:16,515
We all went to school together, right?
He was a fucking lunatic then.

201
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,658
Remember when we used to
go to the Bonamy?

202
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,624
You know, where your nan lives, Bill.
Over the railway.

203
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,457
We used to go over there thieving.

204
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:29,294
They used to keep all the vans over
there with all the catalogue gear.

205
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,501
There was Littlewood's.
What was the other one?

206
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,229
- Freeman's.
- Freeman's.

207
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,636
- They were to us.
- Yeah.

208
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,708
Who'd he shoot?
Was it one of the firm?

209
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,405
No, it was off the plots,
up the fucking road a bit.

210
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:49,919
He's had a row with a couple
of geezers outside a fucking club.

211
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:53,523
- What's that, a fucking oil rig?
- Fucking hell, Red Adair's about?

212
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,496
So he's had a row with
these two geezers...

213
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:02,327
...fucking one's opened their mouth,
it's come out the wrong way.

214
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:07,529
Next thing you know, he's fucking
shot them with a fucking revolver.

215
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,176
- Who's giving him a revolver?
- He's a lunatic, the cunt.

216
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:12,367
Who's this?

217
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,671
Micky Tyne. Skinny guy, long hair.

218
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,345
Got nicked once
for breaking into a pound note.

219
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,184
Cunt.

220
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,688
- Where's he banged up?
- Up in Wayland.

221
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,349
Wayland, for murder.

222
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,427
He's like a time bomb
waiting to go off, that one.

223
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,724
Well, I just said that, didn't I?

224
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,129
Plankoss dossoss.

225
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,930
Who'd he murder?

226
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,741
- Couple of geezers.
- Outside a club.

227
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,245
What?

228
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:52,715
- Do you remember my heart attack?
- Fucking hell. Listen to this.

229
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,251
Listen to this, Bill.
You'll love this one.

230
00:15:55,421 --> 00:16:00,051
I'm 30-fucking-2 years of age, right?
And I have a heart attack, right?

231
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:06,425
So me and him have been out for
two or three days. Been a bit naughty.

232
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:10,193
We're out on this fucking bender,
and we pull these two Richards.

233
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,735
Right fucking sorts, they was.
Weren't they?

234
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:18,501
- We're having everything with them.
- All tackled up. Fucking tackled up.

235
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:22,078
We're having two's-ups and
chop-overs with them.

236
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:25,683
They're at it together. I still have
a wank on the strength of that.

237
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:29,446
So we're sitting there,
and I'm taking these pills, right?

238
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:34,752
I've got these pills. I was diagnosed
with depression. This was years ago.

239
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,590
And these pills, right,
have got a fucking side effect.

240
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:42,096
No one knows over here, right?
The Americans know, right?

241
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:47,034
We're like the fucking guinea pigs.
We're dropping like fucking flies.

242
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,640
So all of a sudden, I'm sitting there,
and you know what?

243
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:54,142
Know what they reckon now?
That these pills make you violent.

244
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,611
- You? You're not violent.
- Not proper violent.

245
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:59,546
No, like weird shit,
like killing your mother.

246
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,515
Wanna kill my mother-in-law for me?

247
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,154
Yeah, fucking she needs it.

248
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:07,383
And guess what they called them.
Everyone called them the "happy pill."

249
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,757
I mean, that's a fucking joke.
Happy pill? They was like cunts.

250
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,524
You couldn't piss, shit or come.
Fucking happy pill?

251
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,000
They could've fucking stuck them up
their asses, as far as I was concerned.

252
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,907
I used to give them to my cellmate
when I was banged up in the Scrubs.

253
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,909
- Remember that Brian?
- Fat cunt.

254
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,742
This geezer had the biggest
head you've ever seen.

255
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:35,012
It was like an armchair. Like someone
had picked up a medicine ball...

256
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,315
...and stuck it on his fucking
shoulders, right?

257
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:43,928
So we're at Micky Tyne's house, right?
Now, we are bang on it, right?

258
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,896
We're taking everything. We're taking
uppers, downers, sidewinders...

259
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,264
...reddies, greenies, blueys,
greenies, Auntie fucking Jeanies.

260
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:55,032
They're like Smarties, they're going
down, and we're out of it.

261
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,335
All of a sudden, I get these pains
right across my chest.

262
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,205
- Braces were too tight.
- Yeah.

263
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:04,577
All across here, right?
All me arms start going numb, right?

264
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,378
And I'm in fucking trouble.
I'm bang in trouble.

265
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:12,250
All across me chest, right across here,
all me arms, all tight, you know?

266
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,552
One minute I'm having a laugh,
so he thinks I'm mucking about.

267
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:16,751
I think he's...

268
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,557
Next minute, I'm on
the floor screaming in pain.

269
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:24,031
So all of a sudden, they've scooped
me up, put me down in a motor...

270
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,400
...and off to the hospital.
Micky Tyne wants to drive.

271
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,371
Now, the three of us are totally
out of our heads.

272
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,033
Micky Tyne is murder in a motor
at the best of times.

273
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,045
Think nothing of going down
a one-way street the wrong way.

274
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,707
- Guy in the way, he'll run him over.
- We're flying down the Old Kent Road.

275
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:43,081
Next thing we know, we're down
this one-way the wrong way.

276
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,883
Suddenly, there's this
big bus in front of us...

277
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,550
...with the biggest black man
behind the wheel you've ever seen.

278
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,958
And he's leaned out the window,
going:

279
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,224
"Where do you think you're going?"

280
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,899
He was a spade,
he weren't a fucking paki.

281
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:03,740
No one go in there yet. I think
a rat's crawled up my ass and died.

282
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,242
We just timed you. You've been
in there fucking 20 minutes.

283
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,414
Shut up. Thank you, darling.
You been anywhere nice?

284
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:16,179
- Here and there. Floating about.
- You want tea, Mum?

285
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:19,448
Yes, please. A strong one.
None of that shamrock shit.

286
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,490
- What's that?
- Three leaves.

287
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:27,929
- Give that cunt a dose of poison.
- Don't you start, Trappy Lil.

288
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,625
Shall I get a nice little drop of wine?

289
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,974
- All right, sweetheart.
- Careful, me head, I'm in pain.

290
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,473
Where you going?
You sleeping here?

291
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,411
No he fucking ain't!

292
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,240
Popping out for a couple of hours,
babe. Won't be long.

293
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,977
Bill, don't get too comfortable here.
Don't forget tomorrow.

294
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:25,317
Be about an hour. I'm gonna get on,
all right? Get rid of him.

295
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,082
See you later, Jan.

296
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,365
Where's he going this time of night
all suited and booted?

297
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,505
I don't know, do I?
Don't care.

298
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:48,240
- Where you going tomorrow?
- To help my mate out at work.

299
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,849
- His work.
- What work?

300
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,276
He ain't got no fucking work.

301
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:57,387
If he wanted to work,
he could finish this room.

302
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,181
He's taking the piss.

303
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,396
We caught him coming out of
the cafe like we arranged, right?

304
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,592
He goes up and gives him
a shot in the eye.

305
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,296
Gives him a black eye so it looks
pucker, you know what I mean?

306
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:18,567
Fat Tommy thinks it's for real. He's
hanging on to his legs, won't let go.

307
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,042
I gotta give him a fucking dig, ain't I?

308
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,704
Because he's hanging
on to me fucking leg...

309
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:27,215
...and when I've hit him,
I think he's gone into shock.

310
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,320
I think I broke his jaw.

311
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:33,321
He's laying on the floor,
and I'm about to kick his head in.

312
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,619
Stamping on his fucking head,
claret everywhere.

313
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:41,664
He's forgot he's in the fucking coup,
ain't he? He thinks he's being robbed.

314
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,495
Well, he is being fucking robbed,
ain't he?

315
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,399
Tell him about the gear next week.

316
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,562
We got a geezer
we been working on...

317
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:52,642
...he works in a warehouse, right?
Down at the west...

318
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,907
What you do is, you go in the front,
moody like you're going to buy big...

319
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:00,677
...then you slip around back, he loads
you up with whatever you want.

320
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:04,948
- You give him a list, he does--
- Don't say too much, he'll go alone.

321
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:35,485
Shithole. Nothing but spades.

322
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:39,613
- You gonna be like this all night?
- I ain't gonna be like this all night.

323
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,850
We're supposed to be
having a beer.

324
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,722
I don't even want to be here!

325
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:54,002
- You're having a laugh, ain't you?
- Look at that.

326
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,623
We'll have some of them marbles.

327
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:31,866
- Fancy a game of camels?
- Camels, sure. Ride the camels.

328
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,771
- Ride it, you lousy camel!
- Giddyup, you cunt!

329
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:27,688
Yeah! That was mine!

330
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:33,564
Give us a fucking prize.
Let's have a prize here.

331
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:36,104
He's won a prize, hasn't he?

332
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,642
Let's have a go, mate.

333
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,340
When they're nice and short,
you see her ass...

334
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:50,614
...and you say to her, "Do a little bit
of dusting over there, sweetheart."

335
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:55,726
As they bend over, you give them a
right good portion up from behind.

336
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:10,333
Ray, over here, look. Little bird
in the glittery dress there.

337
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,205
A bit of you, mate, good lot.

338
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,107
Just down there, look.

339
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,507
Over here.

340
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,688
- Wanna come in?
- I'll come in you.

341
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,020
- Will you?
- Let's have some of that.

342
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:34,063
- Wanna see a nice show?
- I wanna see you.

343
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,894
- Here, something to cuddle at night.
- Oh, cheers.

344
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:57,213
Right on your fucking ass.

345
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,276
All the way down.

346
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,313
What's happened here? Look.

347
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:55,399
- What fucking happened here?
- Look, it's Old Bill. Here, look.

348
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:01,899
Have a look at that.

349
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:09,172
Get on that geezer, there.
Slow down a bit. Get on that, look.

350
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,281
- I can't have none of that.
- He's dead.

351
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,541
- He's well dead.
- Is he dead?

352
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:17,513
Drive on, mate. It gives you
the fucking horrors, don't it?

353
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,890
Looks like hit and run.

354
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,742
I got two grams,
and you owe me 50 fucking quid.

355
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,480
You owe me 50 quid.
Here's 100 fucking quid.

356
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,817
You give me two back.
You owe me 50 quid.

357
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:57,153
Don't cry. I'm getting
the fucking horrors here.

358
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,558
- How you going, all right?
- Not too bad.

359
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:02,996
- Stuart's in the Wimpy.
- Tell him I wanna see him.

360
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,829
Result.

361
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,165
Go on, my son.

362
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,739
Now, you watch and learn, Bill.
You watch and learn, mate.

363
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,641
Watch him go to work.

364
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:33,830
Fucking good shot!
Go on, my son. Fucking sweet as.

365
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:38,867
What goes around, comes around.
What goes around, comes around.

366
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,833
Nice one.

367
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:44,304
Get in, let's get lively.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

368
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:48,172
Sweet as.
Nice one, mate, nice one.

369
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,337
Did you feel that?

370
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:56,442
- Get up! Get up!
- What's going on?

371
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,776
Get up, you cunt! Get up! Get up!
Where's my fucking gear?

372
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:03,216
Where's my fucking gear?
Don't fucking lie to me, you cunt!

373
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:06,357
Where's my fucking gear?
Where's my fucking gear?

374
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:10,358
Don't tell me lies! Don't lie to me,
you cunt, or I'll knock you out!

375
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:11,722
Now, where's my gear?

376
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:15,127
- I don't know what--
- Don't fucking lie to me, you cunt!

377
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,758
Don't fucking put your hands up!
Get your fucking hands off!

378
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,371
Now, Bill, where's my gear?
Don't fanny to me.

379
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,200
Don't ever fucking fanny to me!

380
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:24,534
Where's my gear, Bill?

381
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,576
- Calm yourself down, mate.
- Where's my fucking gear?!

382
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,474
Calm it. You looked for it?

383
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,273
What am I?
Some sort of cunt?

384
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,110
- Where's my gear?
- I don't know!

385
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,151
Don't lie to me!
I tell you now, don't fucking lie!

386
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,812
I'll fucking kill you!
Where's my fucking gear?

387
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:44,623
- What's going on?
- Mind your own fucking business!

388
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,560
- Where's my gear? Don't try to--
- I haven't touched it!

389
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,261
Leave him!

390
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:53,962
- Cunt! Cunt! Yeah?
- No!

391
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,340
What are you doing to him?
Fucking hell, Ray!

392
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:01,239
Get out of my way!
Get that cunt out of my house!

393
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,505
Get that cunt out
of my fucking house!

394
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,478
You're an animal, you are!

395
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,983
You taking the piss out of me?
There's your fucking clothes!

396
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,950
Get him out of my fucking house now!
Get him out!

397
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:15,854
I give him a roof, fed him, give him
money, he fucking thieves off of me?

398
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,928
You fucking junkie cunt!
Get him out or I'll kill him!

399
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:22,362
Then I'll fucking kill you
and your slag shit cunt family!

400
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,127
I'll blow the fucking lot of you up.
Get him out of my house now, cunt!

401
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:29,938
Come and sit down, you.
I'm fucking sick of this!

402
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,973
The pair of you, all the time.

403
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:36,341
You're gonna have to get that
looked at! I'm fucking sick of it!

404
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,005
- Gonna do my fucking head in, you!
- Valerie!

405
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,117
I'm coming!

406
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,113
Careful of that.

407
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,713
Got a spare fag, mate?

408
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:59,855
Blinding. Cheers, mate.

409
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:14,270
- Been in a fight?
- No, no. I'm a brickie.

410
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:19,045
Fell off some scaffolding at work.
It's all right, it's only a scratch.

411
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:26,755
- Is that your boy?
- Yeah.

412
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:34,727
Yeah, fucking, I just had me fucking
bike nicked from over there.

413
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,834
I needed it to get to the hospital,
know what I mean?

414
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:41,335
Couldn't lend us a pound,
could you, mate? So I can get the bus.

415
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:44,339
I'll pay you back.
I only live in the flats.

416
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,170
Gary?

417
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,438
Come on.

418
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,171
Thanks for the fag, yeah.

419
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:52,974
Come on.

420
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:43,294
Excuse me, have you got
any spare change?

421
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:50,666
- You got any--?
- I just got out of the bus, good man.

422
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:59,506
Got any spare change, mate?
Any spare change?

423
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,166
What you done to your nose?

424
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:06,235
Raymond...

425
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,865
...gave me a love bite.

426
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:13,210
Hello? It's me. You up?

427
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:16,938
Yeah, they just give
him some antibiotics.

428
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,672
Yeah.

429
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:23,577
Yeah. No, they said leave it,
it'll heal up on its own.

430
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,416
Yeah, it looked worse
than what it was.

431
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,749
Yeah.

432
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:34,227
Yeah, half-hour.
No, about 20 minutes ago.

433
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:37,060
You know what it's like at the
hospitals at night.

434
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,862
They're understaffed, ain't they?

435
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,598
Yeah.

436
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:46,875
Well, I thought I'd ring you up
and let you know he was all right.

437
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,173
Yeah.

438
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,047
I know.

439
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:54,981
Who's that in the background?
Is he laughing?

440
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:59,623
Tell him for me he's a horrible bastard.
Next time I see him, he'll get a clump.

441
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:01,485
Put him on!

442
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,286
No, he won't, will he?

443
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:06,453
Yeah.

444
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,423
Yeah.

445
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:12,198
Yeah, all right, love. Ta-ta.

446
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,629
I fucking hate that Ray.

447
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,604
I curse the day she ever
laid eyes on that bastard.

448
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,571
Why don't she get out? Leave him?

449
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:25,271
What, with a 5-year-old
and one on the way?

450
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,815
Don't be stupid, Mum.
Where's she gonna go?

451
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,785
Up the fucking halfway house,
living on the fucking social?

452
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,356
Why'd she get pregnant again
if she don't like him?

453
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:38,460
She wanted another kid and didn't
want a different dad, that's why.

454
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:42,592
He's not stopping the night. When
he wakes up he can go downstairs.

455
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,996
Nobody's going downstairs.
There's no room.

456
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,103
I don't want him up here doing drugs.

457
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,761
Oh, leave off, Mum.

458
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,770
- You all right, Bill?
- Yeah.

459
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,884
Oh, let us have a fag, Nan.

460
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:40,717
I left you a tea over there.
Cold by now.

461
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:59,835
I was duly fitted for
a dress in the finest silk...

462
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,376
...with trimmings of English lace.

463
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:06,778
However, merely to dress as a
woman was not enough to satisfy me.

464
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:12,389
It was imperative that I also be
legally declared a woman.

465
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:58,463
Hello? Yeah, all right.

466
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,905
Don't make a noise,
let her see you like that.

467
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,513
- Mum?
- What's the matter?

468
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:20,316
- I need to borrow your van.
- You can't borrow the van.

469
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:23,015
Just give us the keys, Mum.
Don't fuck me about.

470
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:25,491
Look at you!
You can't drive like that!

471
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:26,823
I need some fucking gear!

472
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,965
Keep your voice down.
You'll wake her!

473
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,966
Doing me up, mate!
You don't know!

474
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,499
Where do you want me
to take you?

475
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,472
- Doing me up!
- Where do you want me to take you?

476
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:40,871
The flats.

477
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,138
I fucking hate them flats.

478
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,874
Make this the last time.
Don't make habit of it, Bill.

479
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:49,542
I'll sling some clothes on.

480
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,312
Bill!

481
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,273
Cheers.

482
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,731
Fucking hell! You took your time!

483
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,934
What are you doing? Get in the
fucking back! Don't do that here!

484
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:25,712
And keep down so no one
don't see you!

485
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:59,415
- You all right?
- Yeah.

486
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:22,792
You got any spare change?

487
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,394
No? Nothing? Neither of you?

488
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:28,984
- What you doing here?
- You got any money?

489
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:32,492
Don't be silly. I gave you money
this morning. What you done with it?

490
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:36,496
Something come up, know what
I mean? I had to weigh off a mate.

491
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:39,499
- What mate?
- A mate! I owed him a bit of dough.

492
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:42,399
- I haven't got any money!
- Don't fuck about!

493
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:46,872
Don't raise your voice at me!
Showing me up at fucking work!

494
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:49,574
I've got the pox of it.

495
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,572
- How much do you want?
- A score.

496
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:55,149
I haven't got a score.
I don't go to work...

497
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,513
...so you can spend it on your mates.

498
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,713
- What'd you do with what I gave you?
- I've done that!

499
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,882
- On fucking gear?
- Don't fuck me about!

500
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,722
You know how much you've
had out of me the last year?

501
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,386
It adds up to thousands!

502
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,725
Don't be stupid!
How'd you work that out?

503
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:15,497
You got a 60-pound-a-day habit and
I been supporting it like some cunt!

504
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:20,067
- Just lend me a tenner, then.
- I haven't fucking got any money!

505
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,404
- You ain't got a tenner?
- No, I haven't got--

506
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:25,446
Oh, bollocks, you fucking tight cunt!

507
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:29,881
- I'll get the money! I'll go steal it!
- Yeah, and do plenty of bird!

508
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:36,083
And go back to prison like your old
man? You horrible, selfish bastard!

509
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,349
Val!

510
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:48,013
Valerie!

511
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:27,022
Ray?

512
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:31,057
Ray?

513
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,739
- Well?
- She ain't seen him.

514
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,341
I don't know where he is.

515
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,410
Told you it'd be
a poxy waste of time.

516
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,443
Gave Sue a bell,
he ain't there neither.

517
00:56:57,647 --> 00:57:00,081
He's out on his toes.
He ain't gonna show here.

518
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,343
He might not be bright,
but he ain't no mug.

519
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:04,214
I can't believe no one's seen him.

520
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:07,584
He ain't hard to spot.
He's got a nose like Coco the Clown.

521
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:09,889
It ain't funny though, is it?

522
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:13,426
It's a fluke I weren't in. I'm usually
getting her dinner at that time.

523
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,592
I was around the launderette.
Machine's broken.

524
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,257
- Where were you?
- He was playing snooker.

525
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,199
You all right?

526
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:23,770
You didn't call the Old Bill?

527
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,208
What, with my form?
Don't be stupid.

528
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:28,708
That's all I need,
the Old Bill snooping about...

529
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:31,073
...making themselves busy.
It was Billy, Jan.

530
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:34,910
Spare keys are gone. What am I
gonna say, they broke in with a key?

531
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:36,449
I'd look a cunt, wouldn't I?

532
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,053
- You ain't keeping him up there?
- No, why?

533
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:41,656
Just wondering.
Because you know he's due a dig.

534
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:45,317
He's a thieving slag, and when
I get hold of him, I'll kick his head in.

535
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:47,655
- You had a beer?
- Have I had a beer?

536
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:51,232
- You get lippy when you drink.
- You don't? You want a spank as well?

537
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:54,734
Don't see why not. Knock her about
enough, might as well do a job lot.

538
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:57,065
- Oh, don't start.
- Get me away from this cunt!

539
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:59,798
- I'm not starting.
- Bollocks!

540
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:03,343
He showed up at work, we had words
and that was it. Fucking hiding him.

541
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,648
Get in, Mother, nosy cow!
It's got nothing to do with you!

542
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,649
Get in the car, I wanna get her home.

543
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,651
She has got a name.
She was christened.

544
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,915
Not that you'd fucking remember.

545
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:19,323
That was his mum's picture. Of all the
things he could have fucking nicked...

546
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:23,289
Don't slam the fucking door!

547
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:40,309
All right, Kath. Kath!
Done all your work?

548
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:43,111
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

549
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:48,850
Look. You ain't fucking done that,
have you? Have a look.

550
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,789
- Don't dare raise a hand to me.
- What you gonna do?

551
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:54,452
- Little bird like you.
- Don't you worry, mate.

552
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:57,361
I could give you a kick in the balls,
I ain't that old.

553
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,695
Ain't that old for what?
Want a bit of that?

554
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,667
- Get off! Get off me!
- What?

555
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,569
I'm surprised you still know
where a pair of bollocks are!

556
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:07,972
The last time someone was
hanging out of you...

557
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:10,135
...they must've been fucking
on horseback!

558
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:12,008
The last time you had a trade--
Kath!

559
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:16,481
When was the last time
you had a fucking trade?

560
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:22,989
I'm only-- I'm only fucking about.
Come give us a cuddle.

561
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:25,354
Give us a little cuddle.

562
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,387
Cuddle.

563
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:39,732
Fucking-- I only wanted a fucking
laugh. What's the matter with you?

564
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:42,339
A fucking giggle.

565
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:45,410
A giggle.

566
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:52,780
Hey, Kath!

567
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:56,252
Never lead with your fucking
right hand, babe.

568
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,657
Because if you lead
with your right hand, left hook!

569
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:07,329
Fucking does you a left, right, center,
you know? Draw them in, babe.

570
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:24,347
My baby. I fucking love my baby.
What are you fucking about?

571
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:28,650
Mother? Love you.
I'm going out. See you later.

572
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:31,189
Love you! Bye!

573
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,166
Mum!

574
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,343
Mum!

575
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:27,344
Mum!

576
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,018
Nan!

577
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:48,398
No, no, no.

578
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:51,301
Come here. Look, Mum made this.
Real nice. Have a wee bit.

579
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:53,567
- No!
- Just a wee bit.

580
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:55,574
Kevin! Kevin!

581
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:59,272
Good Yorkshire pudding.
Have a Yorkshire. Have one of these--

582
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:01,246
No! No!

583
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:02,975
- But you like them.
- No!

584
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:05,052
You gotta eat something here.

585
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:09,322
Whoever that is, tell them to fuck off!

586
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:14,288
William, what you doing here?
Come in.

587
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,830
- Is me mum there?
- Yeah, in the living room.

588
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:18,523
Can you get her?

589
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:20,328
- Come on in.
- I'm all right.

590
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:23,470
Janet! Janet, Billy's here!

591
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,871
Billy boy, get your ass in here!

592
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:34,342
You've got some front
coming around here.

593
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:37,884
Ray's on his way. He's just come
off the phone and he sounds boozed.

594
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:39,145
Yeah? So?

595
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:41,984
He's fucked off!
He's got the hump over that picture!

596
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:43,386
What picture?

597
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:48,793
You walked off with his mum's picture.
What have you done with it?

598
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:51,490
- What you laughing at?
- I told him, Ray's--

599
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:53,191
Ray's upset about that picture.

600
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:55,462
We've had murders over
that, you little git!

601
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:59,005
If you're coming in, get upstairs.
He's on his way over with that Mark.

602
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:01,733
- Yeah? Fuck him!
- What you done with the picture?

603
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:04,045
Sold it, mate.

604
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:06,204
Come in. We'll hide you
under the bed.

605
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:08,179
Don't be daft.

606
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:11,118
- I only come up to give you this.
- What's this?

607
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:13,322
That's for you and Nan. Because...

608
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:15,616
...she lends me fags when I
ain't got them...

609
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:18,191
...she makes me cups of tea
and all that lot.

610
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:22,422
You know what I mean? I'm a bit flush
at the minute, so it's all right. Okay?

611
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:25,396
- See you later.
- Billy, take it back! We don't want it!

612
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:28,731
That's yours, all right?
I'll see you in a week. Ta- ta, Val!

613
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:32,170
I don't want big Ray getting hold
of me, you know what I mean?

614
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:36,778
You bring back that picture, right?
It was his mother's!

615
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:42,046
- Mum, you still upset with me?
- No, I love you!

616
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:53,590
No, mate, I'll tell you what
your fucking mate's done, right?

617
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:56,254
He's done what they call
a cold shake.

618
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:59,424
Can't heat them up,
it fucking clogs the syringe.

619
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:01,968
You mix it with water, cold water.

620
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,537
No, warm water, yeah.
Warm water.

621
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:07,801
Shake it till it dissolves.
You've got to crush them up.

622
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:12,937
And that's it.
I mean, you don't fucking pop them.

623
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:16,481
I mean, you get a buzz,
but you won't get a rush.

624
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,246
- No, but they was morphine.
- That's morphine.

625
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:21,390
They're fucking pure, ain't they?

626
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:25,894
- Hey, Schmuddie, give us a fag.
- I ain't got one.

627
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:27,996
- What's that?
- It's a spliff.

628
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:31,291
- I don't want a spliff, I want a fag.
- Do you?

629
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:33,401
Fuck you!

630
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:39,964
People do not die from purity. It's
the cut that shuts down the system.

631
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:44,806
- You've got the cigarettes...
- A bad cut will kill you faster.

632
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:47,643
It's the swag they put in it
that kills you, John.

633
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:51,150
You got, like, one-third heroin, right?
Then you got your dormaine...

634
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,914
...that's your sleeping powder.
That's your nod.

635
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:57,457
- Then you got quinine--
- What are you, a fucking chemist?

636
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:59,652
That gives you the rush.

637
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:03,993
Then you got all the other
fucking crap they cut with it.

638
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,494
- What's that?
- It's a dog, isn't it?

639
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:11,367
- What are you, having a laugh?
- Lovely, isn't it?

640
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:13,939
- Look, look, John.
- It's my dog. It's lovely.

641
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:17,045
Looks like a fucking gerbil.

642
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:22,149
Fuck off, it's a man-eater.
Cunt. Fucking gerbil, look!

643
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:25,481
- John, have a look.
- Fucking lovely little thing.

644
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:28,317
- Fuck off! Gerbil.
- How can that be a dog, though?

645
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:31,983
- It's gonna be a beautiful thing.
- How old is that?

646
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:34,823
- About six weeks.
- No, that's a fucking week old.

647
01:05:34,997 --> 01:05:37,022
- Where'd you get it?
- I found it.

648
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:39,895
- Fucking take care, mate.
- Lovely, ain't it?

649
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:42,333
- Pretty little thing, ain't it?
- Yeah.

650
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:46,236
I'll tell you, we had a fucking dog
years ago, beautiful dog, it was.

651
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:49,139
All Stations, it was.

652
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:50,336
What?

653
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:54,176
That's what I used to call it.

654
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:57,877
That's what I thought they was
saying when I was little. All Stations.

655
01:05:58,054 --> 01:06:00,045
German shepherd.

656
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:05,056
Judy, her name was. Yeah, me dad
fucking put her down when I was little.

657
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:08,390
I went on holiday with me nan...

658
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:11,931
...and when I come back,
he's fobbed us off...

659
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:16,094
...with some right swaggy story about
how it bit someone over at the park.

660
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,500
The lying cunt.

661
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:21,739
I fucking loved that dog.

662
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:24,936
That broke my heart, that did.

663
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:27,179
You know what I mean?

664
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:30,245
Fucking-- That dog never bit no one,
did it, Dan?

665
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:31,943
No, a lovely dog.

666
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:34,385
That's what I mean.
That's what I mean.

667
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:39,426
You fucking...
You know, you go away, right?

668
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:42,189
I went hop-picking
with me nan, right?

669
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:47,132
The first thing I wanted to do when I
got back was to see the dog, right?

670
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:52,706
All right, because I missed it and
all that, and it was fucking dead.

671
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:00,138
I tell you, man...

672
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:05,252
...he was just fucking mean,
my old man.

673
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:07,854
Spiteful cunt.

674
01:07:08,657 --> 01:07:13,253
He didn't care about what other people
felt. He couldn't give a toss.

675
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:18,795
- Do you ever see him?
- No. Fuck him, no.

676
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:23,337
He was a dipper, he was.
That's how he started off, full- on thief.

677
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:28,239
If it weren't nailed down, he'd have it
in his coat. Dan will tell you.

678
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:31,903
- Proper geezer.
- Like, Dan's dad and my dad used to--

679
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:33,946
- Many moons ago.
- Many moons ago...

680
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:36,607
...they used to fucking run together.

681
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:40,482
So, what's he away for, then?

682
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:47,255
What's he away for?

683
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:49,794
He loved his mum.

684
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,697
But, I mean, he loved her to bits.

685
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:56,861
And he found out that his dad was
having it off with some young bird.

686
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:02,534
So he went around there and waited
outside her house. Waited all night.

687
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:06,545
When she got up in the morning
and, like, come out and get the milk...

688
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:08,910
...he fucking stabbed her.

689
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:15,987
That's it, stabbed her to death,
then went to try and do the old man!

690
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:18,490
He didn't die, the old man.

691
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:21,061
I seen him once or twice.

692
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:23,664
But, yeah, they banged him up.
Aimed the fucking--

693
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:27,998
- Look where you're going!
- Fuck off!

694
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:33,899
Hold the fucking dog!
Coming in, you fucking asshole!

695
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:38,069
- Do you want it with me, you wanker?!
- Hey! Dan, that's enough, mate.

696
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:40,511
Fuck him! The fucking fat cunt!

697
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:43,846
- You fucking stupid asshole!
- What's going on?

698
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:47,546
- What's going on? Where's the dog?
- Fucking wanker! Fucking asshole!

699
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:50,658
- Is he all right?
- Look at the size of the fucking dog!

700
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:53,693
- It's fucking shaking!
- Where's the dog? Is he all right?

701
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:55,490
- What happened?
- It's shaking!

702
01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:59,225
You think that's clever?
He's got a fucking dog in his hands!

703
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:01,699
- I saw that.
- Fuck off!

704
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:04,031
Fucking asshole!

705
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,105
What the fuck is that all about?

706
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:08,742
Fuck! What's the matter with you?

707
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:11,375
Fucking hell. Fucking cunt.

708
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:14,215
Yeah, you cunt! You want it?!

709
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:17,181
You fucking wanker!

710
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:19,351
Do you want it, you cunt?!

711
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:23,488
- Do you want it with me?!
- Fucking hell.

712
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:26,991
Fucking hell.

713
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:55,453
Lovely.

714
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:03,530
- Two shots.
- Two shots.

715
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:10,164
Finish the game up here, watch.

716
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:11,829
- No, you won't.
- Watch.

717
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,338
No.

718
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:16,474
Serves you right.

719
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:28,351
- What?
- No, nothing.

720
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:31,758
I'll double this one now.

721
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:34,122
See, like that.

722
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:36,795
Watch this one.

723
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,127
How many shots is that?

724
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:42,293
Twenty-eight.

725
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:44,769
Long one, in the corner pocket.

726
01:10:49,778 --> 01:10:51,006
What to go for?

727
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:54,638
I wanna go for that one there,
but I'll have to chip it around the side.

728
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:56,444
Oh, hello.

729
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:03,150
- Where'd you go?
- Here.

730
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:06,817
Come out for a drink with Mum.
You was sparked out on the settee.

731
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:08,395
I told Mark where I was.

732
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:10,893
- You coming home?
- Yeah, in a bit.

733
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:14,331
- I'm going home now.
- Why don't you stay and have a drink?

734
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:16,698
I don't want a drink.
I've had a drink.

735
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:20,399
- I'm going home. You coming?
- Yeah, in a bit.

736
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:25,342
- Well, how long you gonna be?
- I don't know. Gonna finish me drink.

737
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:30,143
Where's your drink?
You ain't drinking your fucking drink...

738
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:32,583
...you're playing pool.
You can drink at home.

739
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:35,246
It's over there with Mum.
Don't worry about it.

740
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:39,417
I'll catch up later. I'll get a cab.
I got to pick Michelle up, anyway.

741
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:42,529
Don't worry about it, Ray,
I won't be long.

742
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:47,497
I won't tell you again.
Put the fucking cue down...

743
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:52,198
...drink your fucking drink
and get in the cunting car, now.

744
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:55,241
Do as you're fucking told.

745
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:57,503
Liven up, Val. Take your shot, love.

746
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,274
- He's upset her.
- Give us me jacket, Mum.

747
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:03,612
- What's the matter, love?
- Got the hump about something.

748
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:06,414
I'm pissed off with him, that's all.

749
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:15,195
- I'll give you a bell tomorrow.
- All right.

750
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:17,924
- Look after yourself.
- See you, Val.

751
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:21,194
- What's wrong with him?
- Why does he do it? She's pregnant.

752
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:23,065
- I know.
- What's that about?

753
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:25,229
He's going mental.
Had a right pop at her.

754
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:28,467
- Did he have a go at you?
- No, I thought he'd give me a dig.

755
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,818
- All right, babe?
- All right, Mark.

756
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:54,300
Where we going first?
Your nan's? Pick up Michelle?

757
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:56,329
Yeah.

758
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:07,648
I know something
that you don't know.

759
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:13,615
That's right, Jack.
The man is clear in his mind...

760
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:16,587
"-- but his soul is mad.

761
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:19,017
Oh, yeah.

762
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:22,456
He's dying, I think.

763
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:25,862
He hates all this. He hates it.

764
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:27,865
But...

765
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:30,368
...the man's a...

766
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:36,734
He reads poetry out loud, all right?

767
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,473
And a voice...

768
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:43,609
A voice.

769
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:48,818
He likes you because you're still alive.

770
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:50,754
He's got plans for you.

771
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:54,318
No, no. I'm not gonna help you.

772
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:58,398
You're gonna help him, man.
You're gonna help him.

773
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:00,660
What are they gonna say
when he's gone?

774
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:05,000
Because he dies when it dies, man!
When it dies, he dies!

775
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:08,871
What are they gonna say about him?!
They gonna say he was a kind man?!

776
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:12,673
He was a wise man?
He had plans? He had wisdom?

777
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:15,908
Bullshit, man!
Am I gonna be the one...

778
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:20,282
...that's gonna set him straight?!
Look at me. Wrong!

779
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:25,691
You."

780
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,900
Val. Val. Val. Wake up.

781
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:17,602
- I want to talk to you.
- What's the matter?

782
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:21,647
Come on, I got something
for you. Get up, now!

783
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,841
Val!

784
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:50,869
What's the matter?

785
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:54,378
Ray?

786
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:58,586
Ray?

787
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:05,122
- What's going on?
- What?

788
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:07,160
What's going on?

789
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:10,825
- What are you on about?
- Who were you playing pool with?

790
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:13,968
- Who?
- The cunt you was playing pool with.

791
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:19,931
- That's Peter. Peter Murray.
- Peter Murray. Who's Peter Murray?

792
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:22,766
He's a mate of Gus and Paula's.

793
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,806
When did you meet him?

794
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:28,541
- What brought all this on?
- When did you meet him?

795
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:31,345
- Ray, I don't know.
- When did you meet him?

796
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:34,852
Meet him? I just know him.
He's a mate of Gus and Paula's.

797
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:37,491
- I've seen him a couple of times!
- How many times?

798
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:41,151
How many times have you seen him?
Are you fucking rumping him?

799
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:44,127
- Oh, don't be stupid! Look at me.
- Are you fucking him?

800
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:46,699
I look like a fucking barrel!
Who'd fancy me?

801
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:48,994
Tell me straight!
Are you fucking him?!

802
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:52,799
- Oh, I can't be doing with this!
- Don't fucking walk away from me!

803
01:16:53,008 --> 01:16:56,171
- I need a cigarette!
- You want a fag? Have a fucking fag!

804
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:59,142
Come in here, cunt! Come here!

805
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:01,839
Why are you going around there?!
You fucking him?!

806
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:05,680
That Angus, did he fix you up
with one of his little mates? The cunt!

807
01:17:05,854 --> 01:17:10,154
No, I go around there because
I can't stand this. I can't stand you!

808
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:12,520
- So it's true, then?!
- What's true?!

809
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:16,721
- You said you can't fucking stand me!
- I mean this! I can't stand this!

810
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:20,095
- Fucking what?! Fucking what?!
- No!

811
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:24,995
Fucking cunt! Get up, you cunt!

812
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:28,040
Cunt! Cunt! Cunt!

813
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:31,041
Cunt! Cunt!

814
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:38,744
You go to your mum's
or the hospital, I'll kill you!

815
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:42,686
Stay here! You want a drink,
you fucking drink here!

816
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:45,218
You fucking...

817
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:07,015
Go to bed, babe. Go on. Go to bed.

818
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:59,990
Oh, fucking hell.

819
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:04,005
Val, Michelle, it's only me.

820
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:10,676
Hello, darling.
Only popped in for a quick cuppa.

821
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:13,838
Michelle, go watch
the telly, darling. Good girl.

822
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:19,986
Oh, my God!
What you fucking done?

823
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:22,885
Fucking hell!

824
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:26,549
- God, what's the matter with you?
- I got run over.

825
01:19:26,728 --> 01:19:29,219
What do you mean,
you got run over? Where?

826
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:31,364
Around by the shops.

827
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:35,333
- Who run you over?
- I don't know, it was a hit and run.

828
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:38,667
Didn't no one see it, no one there?
No one clocked a number?

829
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,468
I don't think so. Look.

830
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:46,342
That's where he hit me, there.
See? With the side of the headlights.

831
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:50,576
And then I went smack into the road
on me face and when I looked up...

832
01:19:50,752 --> 01:19:54,813
...he'd gone. I mean, it was lucky
I didn't have Michelle with me.

833
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:59,427
- He'd probably have hit her as well.
- He would have fucking killed her.

834
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:01,926
Didn't no one see it?
No one mooching about?

835
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:05,224
No, it was-- You know,
down by the old shops. Down there.

836
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,392
- Were you looking?
- Of course I was looking, Mummy.

837
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:14,167
He come out of nowhere, and then
when I looked up, the fucker had gone.

838
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:18,438
You're fucking lucky. What's the
hospital say? Is the baby all right?

839
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:23,277
Yeah. You know, they gave it
an X-ray scan thing, and...

840
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:26,784
You know, they had a little look
in there. It's just bruising.

841
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:28,684
You don't know how it felt, Mum.

842
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:32,190
Look at me fingers there. Look.
They hurt the most.

843
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:35,693
They hurt more than this.

844
01:20:35,864 --> 01:20:37,923
- Are they broke?
- I don't know.

845
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:39,760
Well, didn't they say?

846
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:44,804
No, they were sort of concentrating
more on the baby, didn't they?

847
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:49,137
Fucking hell. Fucking bastards.
If he had been going any faster...

848
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:53,805
...he could have killed you.
You could have been dead.

849
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:58,214
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- Oh, yeah, please, Mum.

850
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:04,915
Oh, God.

851
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:08,620
Every time I fucking move, it hurts.

852
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:12,391
- Can I have sugar in it?
- Yeah.

853
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:33,816
Mummy's just going
to the toilet, okay?

854
01:21:57,045 --> 01:21:59,013
- Michelle?
- Yeah?

855
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:01,546
Come here a minute, darling.

856
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:05,119
Will you go next door
and get Auntie Pat?

857
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:07,278
- Yeah.
- There's a good girl.

858
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:12,555
Oh, God.

859
01:22:56,571 --> 01:23:00,063
It's murder, really, ain't it?

860
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:03,176
God, if they only fucking knew.

861
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:06,744
What a bastard.

862
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:09,748
Cyanide pill would do him good.

863
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:13,446
You gonna nick him?

864
01:23:14,055 --> 01:23:17,513
Oh, yeah, but then it's my turn.

865
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:22,324
Does he know where you are?

866
01:23:22,764 --> 01:23:26,598
Not yet, no.
I'm in a moody name, ain't I?

867
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:29,931
Jill don't know, does she?
She's got a right mouth on her.

868
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:32,596
No, he won't go snooping
around there.

869
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:37,077
- Billy knows.
- Does he?

870
01:23:37,245 --> 01:23:39,372
How? Did you tell him?

871
01:23:39,547 --> 01:23:44,541
I put the phone down from you
and he showed up, saw I was upset.

872
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:47,483
- Did he go mad?
- Well, he weren't too happy.

873
01:23:48,423 --> 01:23:51,859
Said he hopes he gets run over,
or has a heart attack.

874
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:55,151
- Nan don't know, does she?
- Yeah, why?

875
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:59,390
Oh, Mum.
I just don't want anyone knowing.

876
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:03,731
People know enough about your
business as it is. Nosy fucking mob.

877
01:24:03,905 --> 01:24:06,305
Not Nan. You know...

878
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:08,965
...I just don't want anyone knowing.

879
01:24:09,144 --> 01:24:12,671
Oh, God. Val...

880
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:15,781
...we're unlucky, ain't we?

881
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:24,456
Do you still love him?

882
01:24:40,608 --> 01:24:42,974
There's bits in that.

883
01:24:54,956 --> 01:24:57,652
I've got another headache.

884
01:24:57,826 --> 01:25:00,989
- Do you want an aspirin or something?
- No, I got to wait.

885
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:04,359
I had the last two an hour ago.

886
01:25:46,174 --> 01:25:48,233
Bill, don't soak in there all day.

887
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:51,867
Mum will be home in a minute
and she'll only have the hump.

888
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:55,508
Yeah, mon,
you can't even leave me to soak...

889
01:25:55,683 --> 01:26:00,416
...for two minute, mon.
You mustn't vex me up.

890
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:06,288
Just fling to, fucking leave me
to soak, mon. Leave me.

891
01:26:07,028 --> 01:26:11,021
Every man must have his bath,
you know what I mean?

892
01:26:14,269 --> 01:26:16,999
Love to Michelle?

893
01:26:17,872 --> 01:26:19,237
Michelle.

894

Yeah?

896
01:26:24,078 --> 01:26:28,105
...E-L-L-E.

897
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:31,719
That's it. There you go.

898
01:26:38,259 --> 01:26:39,783
That's it.

899
01:26:39,961 --> 01:26:42,020
Go on, let it go.

900
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:59,536
- Can you see it?
- Yeah.

901
01:27:06,688 --> 01:27:09,418
Give me my kid!
Give me my fucking kid! Right now!

Cunt! Cunt!

903
01:27:13,094 --> 01:27:15,153
She don't want to fucking see you!

904
01:27:15,463 --> 01:27:18,921
Give me my kid! Fuck you!
My kid! Give her, right now!

You fucking cunt!

907
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:25,005
She's lost her baby because of you!

908
01:27:25,206 --> 01:27:28,073
Hey, less of all
the fucking noise, mate!

909
01:27:28,276 --> 01:27:32,178
- You can threaten me all you like!

910
01:27:32,347 --> 01:27:35,646

911
01:27:35,817 --> 01:27:38,479
...and mind your own

912
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:41,052
Go inside!
I'll come smash your window!

913
01:27:41,222 --> 01:27:44,191
I'll kick your door down,
and I'll throw you out!

914
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:46,691
You fucking grass cunt!

915
01:27:46,894 --> 01:27:50,557

918
01:27:59,807 --> 01:28:02,002
Fuck you! I'll fucking find her...

919
01:28:02,176 --> 01:28:04,644
...and I'll come back
and I'll do you, you cunt!

920
01:28:04,812 --> 01:28:08,714
Fucking mug!

924
01:28:16,824 --> 01:28:19,088
- Get back in the motor.

925
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:21,524
- Cunt!
- Don't worry about him.

926
01:28:21,696 --> 01:28:24,494
- He's still looking out the window.
- Get in the motor.

927
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:27,499
- You fucking get back inside!

928
01:28:27,702 --> 01:28:30,569
Get back inside!
Get back in the motor, mate.

929
01:28:30,772 --> 01:28:33,707
LB368-EJM, you cunt!

930
01:28:33,908 --> 01:28:36,672
Old Bill's already got
that fucking number!

931
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:38,709
Write that-- Call the Old Bill!

932
01:28:38,913 --> 01:28:41,780
Get them in here
and I'll shoot them all. You nosy cunt!

933
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:45,385
- You and whose fucking army?
- I'll stab you in the brain.

934
01:28:45,553 --> 01:28:48,886
Get me out of here before I kill
someone. Get me out of here!

935
01:28:49,057 --> 01:28:50,547
I'll kill some cunt!

936
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:57,191
Stop back a little bit, Mark.

937
01:28:58,266 --> 01:28:59,858
Don't-- Don't--

938
01:29:00,068 --> 01:29:02,935
Just hold up, hold up. It don't matter.

939
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:07,604
That's a touch.

940
01:29:07,809 --> 01:29:09,800
Result!

941
01:29:10,044 --> 01:29:11,477
Come on, come on, come on.

942
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,806
Coming through.

943
01:29:15,616 --> 01:29:18,210
- I'm on this cunt.
- Don't worry, I got him.

944
01:29:31,966 --> 01:29:34,264
Hold back a bit.
We're too fucking close.

945
01:29:34,435 --> 01:29:37,097
They're gonna see us
in the fucking mirror.

946
01:29:52,286 --> 01:29:55,016
Val, I just wanna talk to you.
Just two minutes.

947
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:58,317
- No, go away.
- You near her and I'll have you nicked.

948
01:29:59,026 --> 01:30:01,654
Don't fucking push me.

949
01:30:01,829 --> 01:30:03,524
Bastard!

950
01:30:03,765 --> 01:30:06,598
- Leave it, Gus.
- All right, all right. That's enough!

951
01:30:06,768 --> 01:30:08,030
That's enough!

952
01:30:08,269 --> 01:30:10,965
Yeah, you got something to say?

953
01:30:11,172 --> 01:30:12,799
Has nothing to do with you!

954
01:30:12,974 --> 01:30:17,377
- This has nothing to do with you.
- The fucking liberty, that was.

955
01:30:17,545 --> 01:30:20,105
It's all right when you're fucking
coming from behind.

956
01:30:20,615 --> 01:30:22,105
Fucking mug.

957
01:30:22,316 --> 01:30:25,683
Oh, yeah. Well, he's the one,
the fucking liberty, was he?

958
01:30:27,355 --> 01:30:29,118
Get up.

959
01:30:35,963 --> 01:30:39,763
Let's go. Lock the doors.

960
01:30:42,503 --> 01:30:43,629
Jan!

961
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:47,539
Janet!

962
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:50,506
Come on, darling.

963
01:30:50,711 --> 01:30:53,578
- Get in the motor.
- I'll have you, you bastard.

964
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:55,772
Oh, all right. Fucking get in the car.

965
01:30:57,552 --> 01:30:59,816
Keep the doors locked.

966
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:08,829
Hey, is that you?

967
01:31:10,331 --> 01:31:12,765
I've come there to say I'm sorry...

968
01:31:13,367 --> 01:31:16,700
...and all of a sudden
you got that fucking trap.

969
01:31:16,871 --> 01:31:20,534
Do you know what I mean?
"Shut your fucking noise...

970
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:22,608
...or we'll nick you."

971
01:31:22,844 --> 01:31:27,338
Nick you?
Me?! Nick me?!

972
01:31:27,515 --> 01:31:30,279
Nick fucking me?! All I wanna--

973
01:31:30,451 --> 01:31:35,184
All I wanna do
is fucking have a rabbit...

974
01:31:35,389 --> 01:31:38,449
...and I've got a Scotsman
hitting me on the chin...

975
01:31:38,626 --> 01:31:41,595
...kicking me, making me look
like a complete cunt.

976
01:31:41,762 --> 01:31:46,290
Because he's gonna get it. He will--
On my baby's life.

977
01:31:46,467 --> 01:31:48,867
I can't let it go.

978
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:52,597
I can't let it go. I can't let it go.

979
01:31:57,778 --> 01:32:00,303

01:32:09,657 --> 01:32:12,649
He's burning it.

984
01:32:15,663 --> 01:32:19,224

987
01:32:22,904 --> 01:32:24,371

01:32:40,454 --> 01:32:43,446
Val, it's for you.
Sounded important.

993
01:32:51,132 --> 01:32:52,827
Hello?

994
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:55,135

997
01:33:13,854 --> 01:33:15,685

1001
01:33:49,056 --> 01:33:51,024
I love you.

1002
01:33:51,225 --> 01:33:52,852
I love you.

1003
01:33:53,327 --> 01:33:57,161
I love you forever. Forever.

1004
01:33:57,365 --> 01:34:01,199
No, no. I'm a mug.
I'm a cunt.

1005
01:34:01,369 --> 01:34:04,031
I've always been a cunt.
You know I'm a cunt.

1006
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,672
Hold it. Hold up.

1007
01:34:08,843 --> 01:34:11,505
You know how long you've been
fucking with me, right?

1008
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:14,204
I ain't drinking. No, I ain't on it.

1009
01:34:14,548 --> 01:34:19,281
I ain't-- No, I'm not on it.
Babe, I promise you I'm not on it.

1010
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,545
I swear on my life I'm not on it.

1011
01:34:22,757 --> 01:34:25,248
Just listen to me.
Will you just listen to me?

1012
01:34:25,559 --> 01:34:29,586
I had a little boy I loved to bits.
That's my boy.

1013
01:34:29,797 --> 01:34:34,131
But I was with you.
You fucked me off-- No, no.

1014
01:34:34,301 --> 01:34:37,464
You fucked me off before.
I come at you because I love you.

1015
01:34:37,638 --> 01:34:41,438
And you push me. You fucking--
No, you fucking push me.

1016
01:34:41,609 --> 01:34:44,203
You took liberty with me.
You shouldn't push me.

1017
01:34:44,378 --> 01:34:46,812
You know how far to go with me.

1018
01:34:47,014 --> 01:34:50,211
If you been mad at me and you've
been with me that fucking long...

1019
01:34:50,384 --> 01:34:52,045
...you should know!

1020
01:34:52,253 --> 01:34:57,418
Am I wrong? Am I--?
Am I fucking wrong?

1021
01:34:57,591 --> 01:34:59,889
I've never been
wrong in my life, babe.

1022
01:35:00,061 --> 01:35:03,553
I'll stand up and I'll fight.
And I'll fight.

1023
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:06,131
I'll fight him. I'll fight him forever.

1024
01:35:10,905 --> 01:35:12,463
You fucking mug.

1025
01:35:23,117 --> 01:35:25,176
I love you.

1026
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:52,340
You can't fucking hurt me.

1027
01:35:53,881 --> 01:35:56,850
You can't fucking hurt me.

1028
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:01,885
You can try and hurt me.

1029
01:36:02,123 --> 01:36:06,219
You, you can try it.

1030
01:36:06,393 --> 01:36:10,796
You can try it. Every fucking...

1031
01:36:11,165 --> 01:36:15,363
...rule in the fucking book, cunt.

1032
01:36:18,973 --> 01:36:23,808
No! No! No!
It don't matter.

1033
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:30,172
It don't matter what I've done to her.
It don't matter what I've done to her.

1034
01:36:36,357 --> 01:36:41,317
Come down, come down,
come down, come down.

1035
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,895
Babe, babe, babe.

1036
01:36:50,771 --> 01:36:52,898
I love you.

1037
01:36:55,142 --> 01:37:01,172
Of all the things in my life I love,
I love you.

1038
01:37:14,862 --> 01:37:16,853
Val?

1039
01:37:18,532 --> 01:37:20,966
Valerie, where are you?

1040
01:37:24,371 --> 01:37:26,703
You know I love you.

1041
01:37:26,874 --> 01:37:29,968
- I'm sorry, Nan.
- Please, I'm so sorry.

1042
01:37:41,188 --> 01:37:42,883
Michelle?

1043
01:37:43,057 --> 01:37:44,888
Michelle?

1044
01:37:45,059 --> 01:37:46,959
Val?

1045
01:37:49,096 --> 01:37:52,395
Val? Valerie?

1046
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:55,501
I'll kill him, I'm telling you,
if he comes in here.

1047
01:37:56,303 --> 01:37:57,565
- Go away.
- Val.

1048
01:37:57,738 --> 01:38:01,105
Just truly, I wanna see my baby, Val.

1049
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:06,079
I wanna see my babies, Val.

1050
01:38:06,247 --> 01:38:08,147
Val?

1051
01:38:16,223 --> 01:38:18,623
Fucking cold.

1052
01:38:21,595 --> 01:38:25,861
Mum, he's not here. He ain't in.
You better have a look though.

1053
01:38:48,689 --> 01:38:54,025
Oh, my God.
What has he fucking done?

1054
01:38:56,563 --> 01:39:02,126
It's unbelievable, isn't it?
The fucking state of it.

1055
01:39:03,070 --> 01:39:06,335
He had a right fucking party.

1056
01:39:06,507 --> 01:39:10,375
Here, look, they had fireworks
in here last night.

1057
01:39:10,544 --> 01:39:12,842
Mum!

1058
01:39:26,593 --> 01:39:29,221
Fucking hell.

1059
01:40:02,229 --> 01:40:05,392
She took his dinner in to him once.
Me mum, in the pub...

1060
01:40:05,566 --> 01:40:08,467
...and plonked it
in front of him on a tray.

1061
01:40:08,635 --> 01:40:11,433
Knife and fork, salt and pepper.

1062
01:40:11,605 --> 01:40:15,564
He said, "What's that?"

1063
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:18,943
She said, "It's your dinner.
I thought you might be hungry.

1064
01:40:19,113 --> 01:40:20,603
You ain't eaten for three days.

1065
01:40:20,781 --> 01:40:23,909
You live in here, you might
as well fucking eat in here."

1066
01:40:24,084 --> 01:40:25,449
It's funny.

1067
01:40:25,619 --> 01:40:29,111
He didn't like that, did he?
Mugged him up in front of his mates.

1068
01:40:29,289 --> 01:40:33,123
Thought more of them cunts
than he did us. Lovely.

1069
01:40:33,293 --> 01:40:35,124
Yeah.

1070
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:39,224
She got a clump over that.
Well, she would, wouldn't she?

1071
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:53,673
He was always pissed in there,
weren't he? You know?

1072
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:59,285
We go in the pub to get our living.
That's where we do our business.

1073
01:40:59,453 --> 01:41:04,186
He'd be in there spunking out while
we're sitting at home without a dinar.

1074
01:41:05,793 --> 01:41:10,526
And he'd promise things, you know?

1075
01:41:10,697 --> 01:41:13,427
Promise to take us places,
you know? Never did.

1076
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,125
Never took us anywhere.

1077
01:41:16,303 --> 01:41:19,136
And when he did
bother to come home...

1078
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:24,536
...he'd sit in that fucking chair,
doss off with his tray on his lap.

1079
01:41:24,711 --> 01:41:28,169
And I'd just stand there looking at him.

1080
01:41:29,483 --> 01:41:31,781
I'd look in his face...

1081
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:36,856
...and my mother'd go upstairs,
and I'd say:

1082
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:42,117
"Say, Mum,
ain't Daddy coming to bed?"

1083
01:41:42,296 --> 01:41:44,662
And she'd say,
"No. No, he's all right, son.

1084
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:48,165
He'll come when he wakes up."
He's gotta wake up to go to bed.

1085
01:41:48,335 --> 01:41:50,530
Go to bed, yeah.

1086
01:41:52,339 --> 01:41:57,470
Now, I'd stand there looking at this
fucking old man, you know, my dad...

1087
01:41:57,644 --> 01:42:01,011
...you know, in that chair,
that horrible fucking chair...

1088
01:42:01,181 --> 01:42:05,140
...with the shiny, worn-out arms.
I should've burnt the fucking thing.

1089
01:42:11,191 --> 01:42:14,422
By the end he was hemorrhaging
from both ends, you know?

1090
01:42:14,595 --> 01:42:16,893
I used to hear him
hanging on to the kharzi.

1091
01:42:17,064 --> 01:42:19,726
It was lovely.
Never stopped him going to the pub.

1092
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:22,767
No, he was well enough to do that.

1093
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:26,371
Now, one day, right,
he's staggering across the pub...

1094
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:29,873
...pissed from the night before. He's
gone over, right on his mooey...

1095
01:42:30,043 --> 01:42:32,876
...Iike a fucking ironing board.
His hooter's around here...

1096
01:42:33,046 --> 01:42:34,946
...railings all over the fucking place.

1097
01:42:35,115 --> 01:42:37,675
Me and my mother had to go
to the hospital.

1098
01:42:37,851 --> 01:42:41,048
We walked in. He's laying in bed.
Tubes up his arms...

1099
01:42:41,221 --> 01:42:44,122
...down the back of his Gregory.
He didn't look well.

1100
01:42:44,291 --> 01:42:46,759
Fucking vodka was keeping him alive.

1101
01:42:46,927 --> 01:42:50,624
Well, I ain't that interested,
so I'm having a little mooch about.

1102
01:42:50,797 --> 01:42:54,255
I looked above his bed,
and there's this sign, right...

1103
01:42:54,434 --> 01:42:59,030
...with some weird writing on it.
I couldn't read too well at the time.

1104
01:42:59,206 --> 01:43:02,698
I said to my mum,
"Mum, what's that say?

1105
01:43:02,876 --> 01:43:06,539
You know, that sign
above Daddy's head." All right?

1106
01:43:06,713 --> 01:43:11,616
She said, "Nil by mouth."

1107
01:43:11,785 --> 01:43:13,616
"What's that, a football score?"

1108
01:43:13,787 --> 01:43:18,986
One-nil, three-nil, two-nil,
a geezer called fucking Nil. Yeah.

1109
01:43:19,159 --> 01:43:21,389
I said, "Well, what's it mean?"

1110
01:43:21,562 --> 01:43:25,726
She said, "It means..."

1111
01:43:25,899 --> 01:43:29,096
- It means nothing to eat.
- Yeah, nothing down the...

1112
01:43:29,303 --> 01:43:32,466
- Nothing down the-- Yeah.
- Yeah. All right.

1113
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:37,071
I remembered that day...

1114
01:43:37,411 --> 01:43:41,177
...because I could've put that
on his fucking tombstone, you know?

1115
01:43:42,149 --> 01:43:46,552
Because I don't remember one kiss,
you know, one cuddle. Nothing.

1116
01:43:48,755 --> 01:43:51,656
I mean, plenty went down,
not a lot come out.

1117
01:43:51,825 --> 01:43:54,760
You know, nothing that
was any fucking good.

1118
01:43:58,131 --> 01:44:02,932
And I'd look at this man
that I call Dad, you know?

1119
01:44:03,103 --> 01:44:07,870
My father, I knew him as Dad.
He was my fucking dad...

1120
01:44:08,075 --> 01:44:11,272
...but he weren't like
other kids' dads, you know?

1121
01:44:11,445 --> 01:44:14,710
It was as if the word itself
was enough...

1122
01:44:16,116 --> 01:44:18,175
...and it ain't.

1123
01:44:27,894 --> 01:44:31,330
- That ain't when he died though, is it?
- No.

1124
01:44:31,498 --> 01:44:33,398
He lived another 10 years,
slippery cunt.

1125
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:37,468
He died one afternoon
in that fucking armchair. About right.

1126
01:44:39,873 --> 01:44:43,309
I went around to see him when
he was plotted up at me mother's.

1127
01:44:43,477 --> 01:44:44,671
- Hatcham Road?
- Yeah.

1128
01:44:44,845 --> 01:44:47,575
He was upstairs in that
front bedroom. Laid out.

1129
01:44:47,748 --> 01:44:49,807
- Free.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1130
01:44:49,983 --> 01:44:52,315
I've gone up there, gone in.

1131
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:57,249
I'm sitting on the bed looking at him.
He's laying there like:

1132
01:44:57,424 --> 01:44:59,392
Mullered.

1133
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:06,731
And it was like he'd shrunk,
you know? He was a big man.

1134
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:08,595
- He was a lump.
- You should know.

1135
01:45:08,769 --> 01:45:11,329
You got enough clumps off the cunt.

1136
01:45:13,674 --> 01:45:17,542
And I just touched him, you know?

1137
01:45:17,711 --> 01:45:21,442
He was fucking freezing cold.
It frightened the life out of me.

1138
01:45:25,252 --> 01:45:28,779
I was looking at him, you know? I--

1139
01:45:30,290 --> 01:45:33,589
For the first time in my life,
I talked to him.

1140
01:45:35,362 --> 01:45:37,557
I said:

1141
01:45:40,067 --> 01:45:42,592
"Why didn't you ever love me?"

1142
01:47:48,228 --> 01:47:50,196
I'll fucking kill you!

1143
01:47:51,164 --> 01:47:53,064
Billy!

1144
01:47:55,502 --> 01:47:57,367
Hey, hey!

1145
01:47:57,537 --> 01:48:00,199
- Fuck!
- Where do you think you're going?

1146
01:48:00,373 --> 01:48:02,864
- It's locked!
- Open the fucking door!

1147
01:48:03,109 --> 01:48:08,069
- Try the back! Try the back!
- It's a fucking toilet! No!

1148
01:48:08,315 --> 01:48:09,873
- You got a key for that door?
- No.

1149
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:12,348
- Can you open the door?!
- I can't open it!

1150
01:48:12,519 --> 01:48:16,319
- Oh, fucking hell!
- Open the fucking door!

1151
01:48:17,457 --> 01:48:21,018
Hey, you, I'll fucking take
this knife, and I'm gonna stab you...

1152
01:48:21,194 --> 01:48:23,788
...right in the fucking ass,
you little cunt!

1153
01:48:23,964 --> 01:48:27,195
Yeah, you, you cunt!
I'll fucking kill you!

1154
01:48:27,367 --> 01:48:29,358
You got the wrong
couple of geezers.

1155
01:48:29,536 --> 01:48:33,097
I don't know what you're upset about.
It's got fuck- all to do with us.

1156
01:48:33,273 --> 01:48:35,264
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

1157
01:48:35,475 --> 01:48:38,035
- You must've done something.
- Don't open the door!

1158
01:48:38,211 --> 01:48:40,543
I'm not gonna open the door.
He's got a knife!

1159
01:48:40,714 --> 01:48:44,445
- I'll kill him!
- Shit! We're fucked!

1160
01:48:44,651 --> 01:48:48,985
Sorry, man, I can't.
Nothing to do with me, mate.

1161
01:48:50,123 --> 01:48:53,456
You fucking little bastards!
I'll kill you!

1162
01:48:53,627 --> 01:48:56,494
I'll fucking kill you!

1163
01:48:57,430 --> 01:48:59,330
We're fucked.

1164
01:48:59,499 --> 01:49:02,127
Mate, it's got nothing to do with me.

1165
01:49:14,414 --> 01:49:16,848
We're fucked.

1166
01:49:17,017 --> 01:49:20,111
- Why ain't you got a back door?!
- I just work here.

1167
01:49:20,287 --> 01:49:22,778
You fucking mug! Fuck.

1168
01:49:27,327 --> 01:49:30,262
What's his name? That cunt Peter.

1169
01:49:30,430 --> 01:49:34,958
He had two birds with him.
One's name was-- Shit.

1170
01:49:35,835 --> 01:49:40,636
Fucking get someone in here.
I'm not a bad cunt.

1171
01:49:40,807 --> 01:49:41,831
Hi.

1172
01:49:42,008 --> 01:49:43,873
If you ask me,
he's a fucking cunt.

1173
01:49:44,044 --> 01:49:46,808
I'm the one who's in here.

1174
01:52:31,544 --> 01:52:34,172
Does Mum know you're here?

1175
01:52:34,347 --> 01:52:36,144
No.

1176
01:52:37,083 --> 01:52:39,847
Happy birthday.
I got you a little something.

1177
01:52:40,019 --> 01:52:42,214
Where you been hiding?

1178
01:52:42,388 --> 01:52:46,347
- Mark's.
- I saw the flat. It's lovely.

1179
01:52:49,529 --> 01:52:51,588
I heard about Billy. What'd he get?

1180
01:52:52,365 --> 01:52:57,393
Two and a half. I got to get this
shopping in. Got to do Mum's hair.

1181
01:52:58,738 --> 01:53:00,467
Val?

1182
01:53:00,673 --> 01:53:02,402
Val?

1183
01:53:06,546 --> 01:53:09,037
Do you still love me?

1184
01:53:10,917 --> 01:53:13,283
Do I still love you?

1185
01:53:14,554 --> 01:53:16,954
Why'd you do it, Ray?

1186
01:53:17,891 --> 01:53:19,950
I do it...

1187
01:53:20,426 --> 01:53:22,189
I did it because I love you.

1188
01:53:22,996 --> 01:53:25,624
If that's your way of showing it,
you're sick.

1189
01:53:25,799 --> 01:53:29,394
- You ought to get some fucking help.
- I'm gonna stop it, the booze--

1190
01:53:29,569 --> 01:53:32,231
Oh, change the record, for fuck's sake.

1191
01:53:32,405 --> 01:53:35,340
If I could put me hand down me throat
and pull me heart out...

1192
01:53:35,508 --> 01:53:37,806
...I'd give it to you. You know I would.

1193
01:53:42,715 --> 01:53:45,946
She's performing again, the other one.
Giving me grief.

1194
01:53:46,119 --> 01:53:49,987
- Mary?
- Yeah, she won't let me see me boy.

1195
01:53:50,156 --> 01:53:53,648
That's all starting up again.
I suppose I'll be back in court.

1196
01:53:54,027 --> 01:53:57,155
It's my turn to see him, I come
to pick him up, she ain't there.

1197
01:53:57,330 --> 01:53:58,661
She's fucked off.

1198
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:00,322
- Where?
- I don't know.

1199
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:02,798
I've been around her mother's.
I've rung around.

1200
01:54:02,969 --> 01:54:05,961
It's another worry on me plate,
with this and everything else.

1201
01:54:06,139 --> 01:54:09,302
She's stupid, ain't she?
It only hurts the kid in the long run.

1202
01:54:09,475 --> 01:54:12,273
You love that boy,
but you don't do yourself any favors.

1203
01:54:12,478 --> 01:54:15,311
- I've never touched that boy.
- I never said you did.

1204
01:54:15,481 --> 01:54:18,109
But you do hurt people.

1205
01:54:19,152 --> 01:54:21,882
And I've really thought
about this, about you.

1206
01:54:22,055 --> 01:54:25,650
At the end of the day, the only person
you're fooling is yourself.

1207
01:54:25,825 --> 01:54:28,316
You ain't taking
the piss out of me no more.

1208
01:54:28,494 --> 01:54:30,860
You're mugging you.

1209
01:54:48,548 --> 01:54:51,312
I found your picture.

1210
01:54:51,985 --> 01:54:55,682
- What?
- The one Billy took.

1211
01:54:56,556 --> 01:55:00,014
Oh, I'm going indoors.
It's a fucking mess.

1212
01:55:00,193 --> 01:55:01,683
How's your mum?

1213
01:55:03,162 --> 01:55:05,187
Well, she's worried, ain't she?

1214
01:55:05,365 --> 01:55:08,823
She's worried about Billy.
She's worried about me.

1215
01:55:11,905 --> 01:55:16,171
- Coming home?
- We ain't got a home to go back to.

1216
01:55:16,342 --> 01:55:19,869
Everything in that place
is fucking smashed.

1217
01:55:20,046 --> 01:55:24,244
Jesus, I mean, after all that,
you really must hate me.

1218
01:55:24,417 --> 01:55:27,250
- I don't hate you.
- Well, I don't feel loved.

1219
01:55:27,754 --> 01:55:30,314
I mean, that ain't love.

1220
01:55:30,924 --> 01:55:32,448
Fuck.

1221
01:55:33,927 --> 01:55:40,298
Can't you see the mess we're in?
Have you not noticed what we're like?

1222
01:55:40,466 --> 01:55:42,457
I mean, we don't talk anymore.

1223
01:55:43,870 --> 01:55:48,204
All right, just get in, Mum, will you?
Just get in. I'm dealing with it.

1224
01:55:52,412 --> 01:55:54,710
When you go out,
you go with your mates...

1225
01:55:54,914 --> 01:55:58,975
...and when you are in, you're pissed
asleep in front of the television.

1226
01:55:59,152 --> 01:56:01,279
I'll turn the television off,
go to bed...

1227
01:56:01,454 --> 01:56:04,218
...you follow me at 3:00
in the morning stinking of booze.

1228
01:56:04,390 --> 01:56:08,759
That's what I get. Either that
or you're knocking me about.

1229
01:56:10,997 --> 01:56:15,331
I'm 30 today, you know,
and I feel so fucking old.

1230
01:56:15,501 --> 01:56:18,231
You know, I'm so tired.

1231
01:56:18,404 --> 01:56:21,840
I wanna be able to look back and say,
"I had a bit of fun."

1232
01:56:22,008 --> 01:56:26,069
Instead of saying,
"Everyone fucking felt sorry for me."

1233
01:56:26,245 --> 01:56:28,679
I mean, that's the life I've got.

1234
01:56:29,949 --> 01:56:32,281
Do you hear what I'm saying?

1235
01:56:38,458 --> 01:56:40,688
I just don't want it.

1236
01:56:40,893 --> 01:56:43,760
I'll find somebody else.

1237
01:56:43,930 --> 01:56:49,095
You know, someone
who can love me. Someone kind.

1238
01:56:55,708 --> 01:56:58,404
I'll send Michelle your love.

1239
01:58:42,281 --> 01:58:45,307
Yes, it's no problem.
Come on, Mum, a song.

1240
01:58:45,551 --> 01:58:47,917
- Mother, get up and sing.
- Come on.

1241
01:58:48,087 --> 01:58:51,215
- No, I don't want to.
- Oh, come on, Mum!

1242
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:54,723
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, you know you want to.

1243
01:58:56,429 --> 01:58:58,556
- All right, come on.
- Get up there.

1244
01:58:58,731 --> 01:59:01,165
- Haul your ass up there.
- You love it.

1245
01:59:01,334 --> 01:59:03,768
- Hey, hey!
- "Loving That Man of Mine."

1246
01:59:05,771 --> 01:59:08,899
- All right.
- Go on, Mum.

1247
01:59:16,182 --> 01:59:18,412
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

1248
02:01:04,023 --> 02:01:07,515
That's when the geezer did him.
Val spoke to the governor...

1249
02:01:07,693 --> 02:01:10,685
...told him not to move him
and that he was happy where he was.

1250
02:01:10,863 --> 02:01:12,558
She told him this was
gonna happen...

1251
02:01:12,732 --> 02:01:15,860
...because Danny's been putting
the word about that Billy's a grass.

1252
02:01:16,035 --> 02:01:18,765
The geezer that's done him
ain't nothing to do with Danny?

1253
02:01:18,938 --> 02:01:21,031
- No.
- So who cut him?

1254
02:01:21,207 --> 02:01:24,040
You remember when he got arrested?
Danny, right?

1255
02:01:24,210 --> 02:01:26,872
And we had that raid?
They turfed us out of bed...

1256
02:01:27,046 --> 02:01:28,707
...Iooking for drugs, right?

1257
02:01:28,881 --> 02:01:31,042
Billy, to get back
at Danny for that...

1258
02:01:31,217 --> 02:01:33,583
...put his name
in the frame this last time...

1259
02:01:33,753 --> 02:01:37,553
...over some job he's done that Billy
had nothing to do with.

1260
02:01:37,723 --> 02:01:40,624
They were gonna rope him in, right?
Danny's a burglar.

1261
02:01:40,793 --> 02:01:43,489
Billy ain't a burglar,
he's a creeper.

1262
02:01:43,696 --> 02:01:46,494
So he helped the Old Bill.
He's done a TlC with them.

1263
02:01:46,699 --> 02:01:50,294
"We did this, didn't do that,"
to help clear their books...

1264
02:01:50,469 --> 02:01:53,905
...and mark Danny's cards.
So Billy's been sent to the Mount...

1265
02:01:54,073 --> 02:01:55,768
...and Danny's in Wandsworth.

1266
02:01:55,941 --> 02:01:58,967
So he put it about
that Billy Rena's a grass, right?

1267
02:01:59,145 --> 02:02:02,410
So Mum knew it was gonna happen.
We got that phone call...

1268
02:02:02,581 --> 02:02:06,142
...saying they was gonna cut his
head off. We phoned the governor.

1269
02:02:06,319 --> 02:02:08,082
But the geezer that cut him...

1270
02:02:08,254 --> 02:02:11,087
...has got fuck-all to do
with the Danny business.

1271
02:02:11,257 --> 02:02:14,784
Yeah, Billy's got this mate, right,
who's doing a 12-and-half.

1272
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:18,361
His girlfriend's turned up on a visit.
They've had an argument.

1273
02:02:18,664 --> 02:02:21,360
She says, "You ain't the only one
I've had it off with."

1274
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:23,966
She's pulled Billy's name
out of the hat.

1275
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:27,162
- Lovely.
- He's known her for years. That Lisa.

1276
02:02:27,340 --> 02:02:30,969
So this bloke's got the hump
thinking Billy's been giving her one.

1277
02:02:31,143 --> 02:02:34,340
He's got nothing to lose.
He's up for another nine years.

1278
02:02:34,547 --> 02:02:38,540
It's nothing for him to kill someone,
so he done Billy on the exercise yard...

1279
02:02:38,751 --> 02:02:40,719
...for the bird,
not the thing with Danny.

1280
02:02:40,886 --> 02:02:43,878
It's got nothing to do with that,
it's the other thing.

1281
02:02:44,056 --> 02:02:46,786
So he's done him with a knife,
a Stanley knife.

1282
02:02:46,959 --> 02:02:50,520
What amazes me is, how'd they get
the things in there in the first place?

1283
02:02:50,696 --> 02:02:53,358
What's the geezer doing
with a knife in the nick?

1284
02:02:53,532 --> 02:02:55,625
No, it was a moody thing,
you know?

1285
02:02:55,801 --> 02:03:00,363
It was like a toothbrush with
Bic razorblades bound around it, see?

1286
02:03:00,539 --> 02:03:03,872
So that's why Billy is in the
fraggle wing with the weirdoes.

1287
02:03:04,043 --> 02:03:05,169
Isn't he?

1288
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:08,211
See, he's been segregated
for protection, hasn't he?

1289
02:03:09,982 --> 02:03:13,315
He's in there with all the noncers
and rapists. You know?

1290
02:03:13,486 --> 02:03:16,546
Poor sod. Mind your backs.

1291
02:03:27,299 --> 02:03:30,826
He's a C cat. I mean,
he shouldn't even fucking be there.

1292
02:03:31,003 --> 02:03:33,995
If we don't get a result
by the end of the week...

1293
02:03:34,173 --> 02:03:36,164
...we'll take it to the local MP.

1294
02:03:36,342 --> 02:03:39,209
They'll have to move him,
because it'll happen again.

1295
02:03:39,378 --> 02:03:42,779
His card's marked, and this time
the bloke will cut his throat.

1296
02:03:42,948 --> 02:03:46,884
If Billy hadn't turned when he did...
How'd they get hold of a razor?

1297
02:03:47,052 --> 02:03:51,045
They ship them in, don't they?
You'd be surprised what they can get.

1298
02:03:51,223 --> 02:03:53,953
I used to have a bit of puff when
I was doing me bit of bird.

1299
02:03:54,126 --> 02:03:56,253
You used to bring it in,
didn't you, Val?

1300
02:03:56,429 --> 02:03:58,897
Pop it in her mouth,
under the tongue...

1301
02:03:59,098 --> 02:04:02,033
...come out, give us a kiss,
a big frenchie.

1302
02:04:02,201 --> 02:04:03,327
Right.

1303
02:04:03,536 --> 02:04:06,562
I'd swallow it, right,
shit it out the next day.

1304
02:04:06,739 --> 02:04:08,934
You can get anything.
You know, drugs, the lot.

1305
02:04:09,108 --> 02:04:11,941
You'd have a hard job shitting
a razor blade out.

1306
02:04:12,111 --> 02:04:16,241
No. I mean, you can get anything
in there that you can get out here.

1307
02:04:16,415 --> 02:04:20,249
I mean, there's geezers
in there doing all sorts, you know?

1308
02:04:20,419 --> 02:04:22,887
- He's off the gear though, ain't he?
- Yeah.

1309
02:04:23,055 --> 02:04:26,252
He sounded good on the phone,
didn't he? Poor little sod.

1310
02:04:26,425 --> 02:04:28,416
We'll give them
to the end of this week...

1311
02:04:28,594 --> 02:04:31,654
...to do their paperwork
and hope it goes through.

1312
02:04:31,864 --> 02:04:34,765
Mum, come on, we'll be late.

1313
02:04:36,502 --> 02:04:38,800
Worst fucking nick going, isn't it?

1314
02:04:38,971 --> 02:04:42,930
I hate it. Every time I turn that corner
my stomach goes over.

1315
02:04:43,142 --> 02:04:46,441
Horrible hole.
Fancy being banged up there.

1316
02:04:46,612 --> 02:04:48,978
- You got the VO?
- Yeah, it's in me bag.

1317
02:04:49,148 --> 02:04:53,517
We'll be fucked without that. We'll get
there and won't be able to get in.

1318
02:04:54,887 --> 02:04:58,323
Looks nice. Done a good job, Ray.

1319
02:04:59,124 --> 02:05:01,319
Yeah, so...

1320
02:05:02,928 --> 02:05:05,761
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- You got your lD, Mother?

1321
02:05:05,931 --> 02:05:09,662
- Yeah, in me bag, me passport.
- Come on, then. Is the gas off?

1322
02:05:09,902 --> 02:05:13,963
Yeah, off, off, off, off.
I've got me keys.

1323
02:05:20,713 --> 02:05:23,477
- You all right?
- I hope I don't start to cry.

1324
02:05:23,649 --> 02:05:26,641
- When?
- When I see him.
