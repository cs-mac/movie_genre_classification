- Ah, it's such a waste.

an entire movie using this stock footage.

Eddie, what kind
of a movie is this?.

309
00:25:21,063 --> 00:25:23,774
Well, it's about how people
have two personalities:

310
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:27,277
the side they show to the world, and
then the secret person they hide inside.

311
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:31,782
Like Jekyll and Hyde. I've always

used to dress me in girlie clothing.

Well, this is my way
of telling you.

What, by putting it in a fucking script
for everyone to see?.

What kind of sick mind
operates like that?.

And what about this, this
so-called Barbara character...

that's obviously me?.

- Oh, you got nerve, buddy.

- It's a darn good role.
- That's not the issue!

when you're dressed like that?.

- Hmm. I don't know.

750
00:55:37,588 --> 00:55:41,967
Say, Bill, which dress works better
foryou, the red one or the green one?.

751
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:45,053
- Which one is the red one?.
- What do you mean?.

752
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:48,557
I mean, I can't see the difference;
I'm colour blind.

753
00:55:48,682 --> 00:55:50,809
But I kinda like
the dark grey one.

754
00:55:53,103 --> 00:55:57,482
At Universal, we used to shoot one
ortwo scenes a day.

755
00:55:57,608 --> 00:56:00,569
But Eddie can knock off
twenty, thirty.

756
00:56:00,694 --> 00:56:03,405
- He's incredible!
- [Ed]And... action!

757
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:11,079
Okay, you're Dr Eric Vornoff...

758
00:56:11,205 --> 00:56:13,081
and you're upset.

759
00:56:13,207 --> 00:56:17,377
You've worked very hard on this experiment
and you don't want to see it fail.

760
00:56:17,503 --> 00:56:19,379
N-No, you're not
that upset.

761
00:56:19,505 --> 00:56:22,883
You wanna keep moving.
You wanna go through that door.

762
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,597
And... cut!
Beautiful.

763
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:31,391
Print it. Let's move immediately
to scene 52.

764
00:56:31,517 --> 00:56:33,393
- Tor, you in place?.
- [ Tor] Yeah.

765
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:35,812
- Great. Roll camera!
- Rolling. Slate.

766
00:56:35,938 --> 00:56:38,815
- Cue rainstorm.
- [ Water Dripping ]

767
00:56:38,941 --> 00:56:40,817
And... action, Tor.

768
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:47,074
Okay.
You're Lobo.

769
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:49,076
You're upset.

770
00:56:49,201 --> 00:56:53,080
You've worked very hard helping
DrVornoffwith this experiment.

771
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:56,083
You don't wanna
see it fail.

772
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:58,085
No, no.
You're not that upset.

773
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:01,129
You wanna keep moving.
You've got to get through that door.

774
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:09,137
And cut!
Perfect!

775
00:57:09,263 --> 00:57:12,641
- Print it. Let's move on.
- Don't you wanna do another take, Ed?.

776
00:57:12,766 --> 00:57:15,644
Looks like big baldy had a little
trouble gettin' through the door.

777
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:17,646
No, it's fine.
It's real.

778
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:21,942
You know, in actuality, Lobo would have
to struggle with that problem every day.

779
00:57:22,067 --> 00:57:25,946
All right, people, let's get ready.
Actors! I must have my actors!

780
00:57:26,071 --> 00:57:30,450
There you are. Loretta, Tor, I wanna explain
this scene; it's a little complicated, but-

781
00:57:30,576 --> 00:57:33,453
- Bela, you'll be sitting there. Okay?.
- [ Electricity Buzzing ]

782
00:57:33,579 --> 00:57:36,456
I'm not getting near
that goddam thing.

783
00:57:36,582 --> 00:57:39,960
- One of them burned me on The Return OfiChandu.
- All right.

784
00:57:40,085 --> 00:57:42,629
- Then you'll be sitting there.
- Good.

785
00:57:42,754 --> 00:57:45,048
Great. All right, gang,
here's the scene.

786
00:57:45,174 --> 00:57:48,552
Loretta, you're in a trance; you glide
in and get on the operating table.

787
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:52,055
Now, Tor, you're supposed to tie her
down, but you have an angora fetish...

788
00:57:52,181 --> 00:57:55,559
and when you rub that swatch
of angora, it makes you refuse.

789
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:59,563
So then Bela has to discipline you.
All right?. Great! Let's do it!

790
00:58:00,939 --> 00:58:02,816
Action!

791
00:58:08,363 --> 00:58:10,741
Strap her to the table.

792
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:15,746
Do as I command you!

793
00:58:17,623 --> 00:58:21,001
- I'll teach you to disobey me!
- Aaaargh!

794
00:58:21,126 --> 00:58:23,003
- You will obey!
- Uhhhh!

795
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:25,672
- Strap herin!
- Uhhhh!

796
00:58:25,797 --> 00:58:28,759
Strap her in!
I command you!

797
00:58:28,884 --> 00:58:31,762
- Wood! Your cheque bounced.
- I'll get you the money later.

798
00:58:31,887 --> 00:58:34,556
- No, I need it now.
- [Bela ] I'll teach you to disobey me!

799
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:36,558
Cut!

800
00:58:36,683 --> 00:58:40,145
I am terribly sorry to bother you
while you're shooting...

801
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,148
but the guy that owns the stage
needs his money.

802
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:46,652
Well, then, you should
pay him, shouldn't you?.

803
00:58:46,777 --> 00:58:49,154
Yes. Exactly.

804
00:58:54,826 --> 00:58:56,703
I kind of need it now.

805
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:03,335
W-What are you looking at me
like that for?.

806
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,630
I already gave you
my three hundred.

807
00:59:06,755 --> 00:59:08,632
Right.

808
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:11,426
And now I need
the other sixty thousand.

809
00:59:11,552 --> 00:59:14,221
What other sixty thousand?.

810
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:20,102
The other sixty thousand
you said you'd give to me.

811
00:59:20,227 --> 00:59:22,437
You misunderstood, Eddie.

812
00:59:22,563 --> 00:59:26,066
I gave you everything I have in
the world- three hundred dollars.

813
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:45,752
Well, here we go again.

814
00:59:45,878 --> 00:59:48,255
[ Ed ] Let me tell ya,
ya can't lose.

815
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:51,550
It's scary. And ifyou don't like that,
it's romantic.

816
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:54,553
Bela Lugosi will portray
Dr Eric Vornoff.

817
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:04,354
And lovely, lovely, lovely
ingenue Loretta King...

818
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:07,024
is reporter Janet Lawton.

819
01:00:07,149 --> 01:00:10,027
- I don't know. Lugosi looks pretty old.
- Huh?.

820
01:00:11,653 --> 01:00:13,655
Which role
does Vampira play?

821
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:16,450
Vampira?.
Why do you ask?.

822
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:18,827
She's standing
right over there.

823
01:00:21,622 --> 01:00:24,082
Well, she plays-

824
01:00:26,418 --> 01:00:28,462
Excuse me one minute.

825
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,049
- [ Woman Laughing ]
- Pardon me. Miss Vampira?.

826
01:00:32,174 --> 01:00:35,052
-Yes?.
- You don't know me, but I'm Ed Wood.

827
01:00:35,177 --> 01:00:38,555
I'm a film producer and I'm currently in
production on a science fiction piece...

828
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,891
with Bela Lugosi and Swedish
wrestler Tor Johnson.

829
01:00:41,016 --> 01:00:44,102
I don't understand.
Do you want my autograph?.

830
01:00:44,228 --> 01:00:46,271
No.

831
01:00:46,396 --> 01:00:49,274
No, I- I think my film
is perfect foryou.

832
01:00:49,399 --> 01:00:53,278
Want me to show it on my TV programme.
I have nothing to do with that.

833
01:00:53,403 --> 01:00:56,281
- You should call the station manager at Channel 7.
- No, no. No, no, no, no.

834
01:00:56,406 --> 01:01:00,452
I don't want you to show the movie,
I want you to be in it. Let me explain.

835
01:01:00,577 --> 01:01:03,372
We started shooting, but after
three days we got shut down.

836
01:01:03,497 --> 01:01:06,583
Now we're having a backers party
to raise some more money.

837
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:09,711
So I thought perhaps you'd like to come over
just to say "howdy" to some of the backers.

838
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:12,631
Look, I'm with some friends
and we're about to eat.

839
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:14,633
Please! It would
just take one second.

840
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:18,512
Come over and meet the backkers. There
is a really nice dentist firom Ox. nard.

841
01:01:18,637 --> 01:01:21,515
Look, buddy, I've got real offers
from real studios.

842
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:25,978
I don't need to blow some dentist
for a part. Forget it.

843
01:01:26,103 --> 01:01:28,230
Miss Vampira!

844
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:30,816
- Please.
- Ohh! Let's go.

845
01:01:32,359 --> 01:01:35,821
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
Let's get out of here.

846
01:01:35,946 --> 01:01:38,031
Yeah, I thinkk
you're right.

847
01:01:38,156 --> 01:01:42,536
Thankyou, folks, for comin' tonight,
but we better go.

848
01:01:42,661 --> 01:01:46,039
And then Dr Vornoff
falls into the pit...

849
01:01:46,164 --> 01:01:49,418
and his own octopus
attacks and eats him.

850
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:52,421
- The end.
- Whew!

851
01:01:52,546 --> 01:01:55,132
- Well, that's quite a story.
- Yes.

852
01:01:56,341 --> 01:01:59,011
So, uh, you made the movie...

853
01:01:59,136 --> 01:02:01,597
and now you wanna
make it again?.

854
01:02:01,722 --> 01:02:03,515
No.

855
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:07,519
We shot ten minutes of the movie, and
now we're looking for completion funds.

856
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:09,646
Oh, son, you're too vague.

857
01:02:09,771 --> 01:02:12,649
- [Machine Starting, Whirring]
- Billy Bob!

858
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:16,737
You're cuttin' 'em
too lean.

859
01:02:16,862 --> 01:02:19,031
Mr McCoy.

860
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:23,327
- How can I make you happy?.
- [ Spits ]

861
01:02:23,452 --> 01:02:26,205
Okkay.

862
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:28,207
Two things.

863
01:02:28,332 --> 01:02:33,545
Number one: I want the movie
to end with a big explosion.

864
01:02:35,464 --> 01:02:37,424
Sky full of smoke.

865
01:02:39,134 --> 01:02:41,011
Yes.

866
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:44,181
But it ends with Dr Vornoff
falling into the pit.

867
01:02:44,306 --> 01:02:46,642
Not any more.

868
01:02:46,767 --> 01:02:48,936
Numbertwo:

869
01:02:49,061 --> 01:02:51,230
I got a son.

870
01:02:51,355 --> 01:02:55,901
He's a little slow,
but a good boy.

871
01:02:56,026 --> 01:03:00,030
And somethin' tells me
he'd make a helluva leadin' man.

872
01:03:04,701 --> 01:03:06,578
Sounds perfect.

873
01:03:06,787 --> 01:03:08,580
This is unbelievable.

874
01:03:08,705 --> 01:03:11,583
I woulda bet a million bucks that
Ed wouldn't finish this picture.

875
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:14,586
Yeah, well, it ain't finished yet, kid;
anything can happen.

876
01:03:15,712 --> 01:03:17,589
Stay out of
scratching distance.

877
01:03:17,714 --> 01:03:21,593
- Poodle, you made it. I wasn't sure you got my message.
- Well, of course I made it.

878
01:03:21,718 --> 01:03:24,596
- Today's the file clerk's big scene.
- That's right.

879
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:27,599
I see the usual gang of misfits
and dope addicts are here.

880
01:03:27,724 --> 01:03:30,435
- [Man ]Janet, I wantyou-
- Say, who's the lug?.

881
01:03:30,561 --> 01:03:35,607
Str- I want you staying away
from the old Willows place.

882
01:03:35,732 --> 01:03:38,610
Why, that's Tony McCoy. He will be
portraying Lieutenant Dick Craig.

883
01:03:38,735 --> 01:03:40,612
- [ Tony Continues Fumbling Lines ]
- Really.

884
01:03:40,737 --> 01:03:44,616
- How much money did he put up?.
- None. But his dad gave me fifty grand.

885
01:03:44,741 --> 01:03:47,119
Hmm. Wood Productions,
the mark of quality.

886
01:03:47,244 --> 01:03:50,539
Listen, the movie's getting made;
that's all that matters.

887
01:03:51,665 --> 01:03:53,542
- Hello, Harry.
- Oh, hi, Dolores.

888
01:03:53,667 --> 01:03:56,044
Oh!
You're Dolores.

889
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:58,505
I've heard so much about you.

890
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:01,508
I'm Loretta King.
Oh, here, take the chair.

891
01:04:01,633 --> 01:04:03,468
Oh, don't be silly.
Let Harry finish.

892
01:04:03,594 --> 01:04:05,762
You still need
some more work.

893
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:07,764
No. I'm finished.

894
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:11,268
- All I needed was a touch-up.
- Hmm. That mole still shows.

895
01:04:11,393 --> 01:04:14,438
Uh, ladies!
You both look fine.

896
01:04:15,606 --> 01:04:18,483
Why don't we talk
about the scene?.

897
01:04:18,609 --> 01:04:20,694
Okay,Janet Lawton
