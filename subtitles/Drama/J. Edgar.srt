1
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:26,917
Let me tell you something.

2
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:30,546
The SCLC has direct
Communist ties.

3
00:00:30,713 --> 00:00:33,382
Even great men can be corrupted,
can't they?

4
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,094
Communism is not a political party.
It is a disease.

5
00:00:37,262 --> 00:00:40,088
It corrupts the soul, turning
even the gentlest of men...

6
00:00:40,156 --> 00:00:43,267
... into vicious, evil tyrants.

7
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:46,854
What we are seeing is a pervasive
contempt for law and order.

8
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:48,105
Crime rates are soaring.

9
00:00:48,273 --> 00:00:50,983
There's widespread, open
defiance of our authority.

10
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,652
Mark my words,
if this goes unchecked...

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,407
... it will once again plunge our
nation into the depths of anarchy.

12
00:00:58,575 --> 00:01:01,410
It all starts out peacefully,
doesn't it, Mr. Irwin?

13
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:03,120
You're gonna have to
live with the fact...

14
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,206
... that you could've helped prevent
the bombings and the violence.

15
00:01:06,374 --> 00:01:08,917
I'm more interested in what this
says about you, and your FBI.

16
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:11,461
I have worked too long and hard
to just sit back...

17
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:15,424
... and watch the bad guys capture
the spotlight again, haven't I?

18
00:01:15,592 --> 00:01:17,301
You know, the funny thing
about notoriety...

19
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:21,930
... especially the kind that needs
adoration, fame for fame's sake...

20
00:01:22,098 --> 00:01:24,349
... if unchecked,
it inevitably leads to villainy.

21
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:27,769
I suggest you look at what this
squabble is really about...

22
00:01:27,937 --> 00:01:30,073
... before you destroy the
reputation of the thing...

23
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:31,973
... we both know you love most.

24
00:01:46,456 --> 00:01:49,082
Sir, the writer's here
from Crime Records...

25
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,292
... the PR Department.

26
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,462
Set him up with a typewriter
in my outer office.

27
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,090
Miss Gandy, it's time this generation
learn my side of the story.

28
00:01:57,258 --> 00:01:59,301
- Right away.
- Thank you.

29
00:02:00,845 --> 00:02:03,180
In 1919, Agent Smith...

30
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:05,807
... my first boss here
at the Department of Justice...

31
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:09,019
...was Attorney General
A. Mitchell Palmer.

32
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:10,354
He was a Quaker.

33
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:11,884
He didn't believe in war...

34
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:15,484
... but he understood the
necessity of strength and resolve.

35
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:17,486
Believe what you will
from historians...

36
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:21,573
... most write from a present
perspective, forgetting context.

37
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:24,826
Mitchell Palmer was a hero.

38
00:02:57,193 --> 00:02:59,027
- Are you all right?
- Uh.

39
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:02,380
- Are you all right?
- Yes. I think. Yes.

40
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:22,384
It's all right.
Come here.

41
00:03:22,552 --> 00:03:26,054
- It's all right, it's all right.
- No, it's okay.

42
00:03:26,222 --> 00:03:29,016
Are you okay?
It's okay.

43
00:03:32,937 --> 00:03:34,855
Are you okay?

44
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:03,091
You see, Palmer fought
the radicals, just as I have.

45
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:07,721
And just as I have, he was targeted.
He wasn't alone.

46
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:12,768
Across the country that night,
eight bombs exploded, all at 11 pm.

47
00:04:12,935 --> 00:04:14,436
Two United States senators...

48
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:17,105
... four cabinet members,
a Supreme Court justice...

49
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:19,399
... John D. Rockefeller,
J.P. Morgan...

50
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:23,445
... all of them targeted
by Bolshevik Communists.

51
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:25,781
Yeah, it shook the whole thing.

52
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:32,662
It was clear to me the radical's
bomb went off too soon...

53
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,624
... leaving only his blood
in the street.

54
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:39,120
But the inspectors used buckets
to clean up the mess...

55
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:40,420
... instead of collecting it.

56
00:04:40,588 --> 00:04:43,965
They discarded his gun
instead of preserving its prints.

57
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:46,301
But you see,
this wasn't clumsy police work.

58
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:49,596
In those times,
it was normal procedure.

59
00:04:49,764 --> 00:04:53,058
This may be the end of days
for this country, Dwight.

60
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,650
It was 1919, before anyone
respected criminal science...

61
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:04,820
... before federal powers,
before the FBI.

62
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:10,575
It was that night my eyes
were opened. That very night.

63
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:12,869
Is he a neighbor, sir?

64
00:05:13,371 --> 00:05:15,288
No.
He works in my office.

65
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:22,003
"There will have to be murder.
We will kill because it is necessary."

66
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:25,966
"We will destroy to rid the world
of your tyrannical institutions."

67
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,810
You were at Attorney General
Palmer's home that night?

68
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:39,563
Well, let's leave that
to the reader's imagination.

69
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:43,650
You see, it's important we give
our protagonist a bit of mystery.

70
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,820
I could allude to a young man
who matches your description.

71
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:48,447
The best of both worlds.

72
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,824
Where did you get
your law degree?

73
00:05:50,992 --> 00:05:53,160
George Washington.
I grew up here.

74
00:05:53,327 --> 00:05:55,620
I had a mom to take care of,
so I stayed close.

75
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,039
I received an English
degree there also.

76
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:03,044
Then I don't need to tell you that
what determines a man's legacy...

77
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:05,505
... is often what isn't seen.

78
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,091
What's critical
at this moment is...

79
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:12,554
... that we re-clarify the difference
between villain and hero.

80
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:16,725
How do you think
that compares with today?

81
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:20,520
I'm not sure, sir.
I'd like to hear more.

82
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:22,689
I could come back tomorrow.

83
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:26,693
Fine.
But the pages stay here.

84
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:28,195
Of course, sir.

85
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:31,239
Agent Smith.

86
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:32,491
Thank you, sir.

87
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,876
Never a good idea
to talk too loud.

88
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:50,807
- Good morning, John.
- Good morning.

89
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:53,970
Mr. Palmer has asked that you attend
the emergency meeting today.

90
00:06:54,138 --> 00:06:55,680
Miss Gladwell,
please remember...

91
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,517
... it's Mr. Hoover.

92
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,602
Two o'clock.

93
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,439
Don't be too early this time.
It's as rude as being tardy.

94
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:08,860
And who is this lovely addition
to the secretarial pool?

95
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:13,949
Helen, introduce yourself.

96
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,242
Oh.

97
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:18,245
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Hoover.
I'm Helen Gandy.

98
00:07:18,412 --> 00:07:21,456
Pleased to meet you, Miss Gandy.
Welcome to the Department of Justice.

99
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,544
You can notify Mr. Palmer
that I will attend.

100
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:27,754
Of course.

101
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:33,510
He's always a charmer. I wouldn't
take anything very seriously.

102
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:44,604
Jeremy, I need your help.

103
00:07:44,772 --> 00:07:46,439
I need, uh... uh, help.

104
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:48,066
I need your help.

105
00:08:06,294 --> 00:08:07,460
Good evening, Mother.

106
00:08:11,173 --> 00:08:12,340
Edgar.

107
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:17,012
Madame Marcia
held court this morning.

108
00:08:17,638 --> 00:08:20,348
A premonition:
I should buy a dress.

109
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,852
She says your father
will die soon.

110
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,851
And when he does...

111
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:29,691
... you will rise to be the most
powerful man in the country.

112
00:08:33,571 --> 00:08:35,864
Your brother's
a good man, Edgar...

113
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:39,534
... but you will restore
our family to greatness.

114
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,872
Edgar?

115
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,541
Edgar?
Am I boring you?

116
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:49,377
I'm listening, Mother.
You fired the maid.

117
00:08:50,212 --> 00:08:52,422
I told her when she was through
with the work, she could quit.

118
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,552
I'm not paying
for her impudence.

119
00:08:54,953 --> 00:08:57,052
The whole Negro race
is in open revolt.

120
00:08:57,219 --> 00:08:59,387
- I could open an investigation.
- Gotten too comfortable.

121
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:02,515
Did you hear what I said, Mother?
I said I could open an investigation.

122
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:03,808
Say what you mean.

123
00:09:04,393 --> 00:09:06,755
Mr. Palmer called me
into a meeting today.

124
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:08,355
The war against
the Bolsheviks has begun.

125
00:09:08,522 --> 00:09:11,733
He's insisted that I lead
a new anti-radical division.

126
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:13,401
Did you leap like a dog?

127
00:09:14,111 --> 00:09:17,238
I told him this is perhaps the greatest
threat our nation has ever faced...

128
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:21,242
... and I cannot take the job unless
I feel certain I can be effective.

129
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,870
Well done.
But you'll take it.

130
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:25,914
Three thousand a year, Mother.

131
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:29,084
I got to get you new clothes.
You can't look like that anymore.

132
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,881
I have 40 names of suspected
radicals already in only four hours.

133
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:36,925
I should have 10,000
by the end of the month.

134
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:41,888
And I have my own staff,
trusted agents.

135
00:09:42,056 --> 00:09:44,599
Edgar, are you smoking?

136
00:09:45,393 --> 00:09:48,770
- Doesn't come naturally, Mother.
- Listen to the doctor.

137
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:52,399
With this new burden, your
nerves could get the better of you.

138
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:58,071
You don't want to
end up like your father.

139
00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:00,782
Go and try one now.
You can put your father in his room.

140
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,450
I have to get ready for dinner.

141
00:10:04,787 --> 00:10:06,538
Are you abandoning me tonight?

142
00:10:07,748 --> 00:10:10,125
It's with a typist.
She's very organized.

143
00:10:11,502 --> 00:10:12,544
Is it a date?

144
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,754
I think so, I think so.

145
00:10:14,922 --> 00:10:17,100
I'm gonna show her my old
card catalog system...

146
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:19,300
... at the Library of Congress.

147
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,344
Romance her.

148
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:23,722
Wear a blue tie.

149
00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:27,058
You look so handsome
in your blue tie.

150
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,820
Look at the ceiling.

151
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:40,488
It's incredible.

152
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:47,620
I've never been here before.

153
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,463
I helped organize it.

154
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,174
See, every item is assigned
its own index card...

155
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:01,092
... with its own completely
unique code...

156
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,221
... indicating the title, author,
location, and topic.

157
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:09,768
What used to take days to locate
now only takes a matter of minutes.

158
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:13,271
Go on. Give me an author
or a topic. Anything.

159
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,315
Indiscretion.

160
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:16,691
What era?

161
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:17,984
Present day.

162
00:11:18,152 --> 00:11:20,612
Good.
Time me.

163
00:11:47,264 --> 00:11:48,723
Hmm.

164
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:53,603
Heh.

165
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:58,066
Almost there, heh.

166
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,806
How do you know I didn't
mean political indiscretion?

167
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,268
Well, if you'd like,
I can start all over again.

168
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,602
This will do.

169
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,479
How long did I take?

170
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,815
One minute, 10 seconds.

171
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,610
Now imagine if every citizen in this
country were uniquely identifiable...

172
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:21,990
... by their own card and number,
say, the pattern on their fingers.

173
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:27,036
Imagine how quickly we could
find them if they committed a crime.

174
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,330
It's all very impressive, John.

175
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,919
Well, would you like to stay here or
would you like to go somewhere else?

176
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,213
It's up to you.

177
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:42,927
Mr. Hoover.

178
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,016
I'm not sure where you think
this is headed.

179
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,185
Right, of course.

180
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,980
Miss Gandy.

181
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,027
I know we've only known
each other a brief time...

182
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,529
...but I'm sure you would
make the finest of companions.

183
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:05,158
Your strength, your character,
your education.

184
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,285
Are you poking fun at me?

185
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,789
No. No, no, no.
No, of course not.

186
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,209
Then please, Mr. Hoover,
stand up.

187
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,716
I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't share this...

188
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,886
... with any of the other women
in the typing pool.

189
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,554
No, of course not.

190
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,224
May I ask what... what...

191
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,728
... what particular flaw
you seem to find in my character?

192
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,397
No.
We just met.

193
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,732
Right, of course.

194
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,902
I believe that I'm a fast and
accurate judge of character.

195
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,604
I know we've only gone out three
times, but I don't need more than that.

196
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:47,033
Most people do, but I don't. I see
people right off for what they are.

197
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,578
And please, call me Edgar.
It's what my mother uses.

198
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,664
- Edgar?
- Yes?

199
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,083
Can you keep a secret?

200
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,753
Yes, of course.
You have my word.

201
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:04,926
I'm not interested in getting married.
My work comes first.

202
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,637
Hmm.

203
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:14,435
Then perhaps you would consider
a position as my personal secretary.

204
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,442
Yes.

205
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,778
Shall we?

206
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,155
The book.

207
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,949
Right.

208
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,910
After you.

209
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:35,623
I helped organize that library
just as I did this Bureau.

210
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,126
And many said
we didn't need either.

211
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,588
You see, innovators
aren't often celebrated.

212
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,798
Not at first.

213
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:56,728
Miss Gandy.
Miss Gandy.

214
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,649
The nitwit Kennedy child
rang his baby buzzer again.

215
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,401
Perhaps he'd like a fresh diaper.

216
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,945
Should I find out what
the Attorney General needs?

217
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,824
No, I want the completed transcripts
of the Los Angeles recordings.

218
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,827
When I receive those,
then we'll answer his buzzer.

219
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,746
Very good.

220
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,665
Edgar, Agent Smith is back.

221
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,919
He uh... has some questions
about the Palmer Raids.

222
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,338
Should I tell him to go?

223
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,674
Helen, do you like him?

224
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,177
I don't have an opinion
of him yet.

225
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,304
Hmm.

226
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,932
Well, I like him.
I trust him.

227
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,852
- I'll set him up in your outer office.
- No. No, no, no.

228
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,313
Bring him a desk in here.

229
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,652
But in 1920, how could I
protect us from anyone?

230
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,738
Before I moved to this office,
we were powerless.

231
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,658
We had few federal laws,
no right to carry firearms...

232
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,993
... and Congress liked it that way.

233
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:58,414
Criminals ran free, but there was
no law against keeping track of them...

234
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,750
... so I made a decision
on my own.

235
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,461
I compiled note cards
and over five thousand names...

236
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,880
... and called the one department
in Washington...

237
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,716
... that still held a small piece
of untested power.

238
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:12,553
Was that the Department of Labor?
The power to deport, sir?

239
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,264
But only to deport those
who checked two boxes.

240
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,569
They had to be foreign citizens...

241
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,269
... and they had to be working
to harm our country.

242
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,188
And they cooperated with you?

243
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,982
Of course not.

244
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,319
No one freely shares power
in Washington DC, Agent Smith.

245
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,406
You mean to tell me there is no law
under which you can issue a warrant...

246
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,241
... for the arrest of an alien...

247
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,077
... when I have certified that
he is subject to deportation?

248
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,997
Without any evidence,
Mr. Attorney General, no.

249
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,749
- There exists a due process of law.
- Due process of law?

250
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,512
What about the threat
to our country?

251
00:16:44,513 --> 00:16:45,712
Well, there might be
a threat to our country...

252
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,005
Might be?

253
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,882
Fine.
There is a threat to our country.

254
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,469
But with no proof of a crime,
there's no cause for deportation.

255
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,596
We'll see about that.

256
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,598
You'll be hearing from me.

257
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,936
But one of their heads
was a Mr. Caminetti.

258
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,658
He was weary
of our Justice Department...

259
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:06,858
... but he hated
one person even more.

260
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,194
I am a revolutionist by nature...

261
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,446
... and as such...

262
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:15,783
... I claim the right to rebel
and resist invasion...

263
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:19,454
... by all means, force included.

264
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,915
Emma Goldman. She was the
hero of the radical movement.

265
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,687
If I could hand Caminetti
Emma Goldman...

266
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:27,587
... he would deport her
without a thought.

267
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,089
But she was a citizen.

268
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,969
Would you like to stop, sir?

269
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,558
No.

270
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,028
I know it's hard for you to imagine
today, but there was a time...

271
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,358
... when the average American...

272
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,358
... feared for their safety
and survival, Agent Smith.

273
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,364
In Chicago, a coal strike
started by communist labor...

274
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:54,864
... shut off all the power.

275
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,324
Riots followed.

276
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,160
And on Armistice Day
in Centralia, Washington...

277
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,830
... veterans fresh back from the war
were murdered by radicals.

278
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,752
The red revolution
had arrived on our soil.

279
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,611
No, no. We can't take them
down one by one.

280
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,856
Otherwise they'll go underground
and we'll have a bomb...

281
00:18:18,857 --> 00:18:20,556
... inside every senator's mailbox.

282
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:23,851
We need to have a simultaneous
raid, hitting all of them at once.

283
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,405
- Who are "they"?
- That's what you're here to find out.

284
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:30,066
Now listen, I want a card on every
radical person in this country.

285
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,134
Against the wall, gentlemen.
Thank you.

286
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,321
I want to know who they are,
where they're from...

287
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:35,321
... what group they belong to,
what they say.

288
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,073
Who have already
committed a crime?

289
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,286
I could care less whether
they committed a crime.

290
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:40,586
I want to know
whether they intend to.

291
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:41,786
Against the wall, gentlemen.
Thank you.

292
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,705
- How many are on our team?
- Only you four for now.

293
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,666
I'll have locks installed.

294
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,544
No, Miss Gandy. That would
bring too much attention.

295
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,712
Nothing is to be
alphabetically ordered.

296
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,799
I want the cards to be broken down
into subjects and categories.

297
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,385
Now, this system should be
easy enough if explained.

298
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,513
If not, finding information
should prove impossible.

299
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,393
And trust no one,
not even our fellow agents.

300
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,062
Half our colleagues are on both
sides of the payroll anyway.

301
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,524
But the crimes we're investigating
aren't crimes, they're ideas.

302
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,984
Well, if your idea...

303
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,319
Against the wall, gentlemen.
Thank you.

304
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:19,000
If your idea is to come into our
country and plot the overthrow...

305
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:21,534
... of our government, then yes,
indeed, that is a crime.

306
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,162
Mrs. Goldman married
a U.S. citizen.

307
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,583
The man she married hasn't visited
her once in prison, yet this man...

308
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,752
... the man she's living with since
her wedding day, he visits her nightly.

309
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,264
Tell me John, what happens
when we raid this list of yours...

310
00:19:34,265 --> 00:19:35,120
... and find nothing?

311
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,467
No guns, no bombs,
just innocent people deported.

312
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,762
Every corner of this nation,
the American people...

313
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,016
... have urged the Attorney General
to do something about this violence...

314
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,551
... and help return the United
States back to peace and glory.

315
00:19:47,552 --> 00:19:50,438
Now, I'm happy to send your
objections to Mr. Palmer himself...

316
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,691
... but in the meantime, you'll expose
Miss Goldman's sham marriage...

317
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,111
... and you will change
that suit of yours.

318
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,363
- Pardon me, John?
- Your suit, sir, your suit.

319
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,573
This isn't a saloon.

320
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,117
You have some respect for yourself,
but more importantly...

321
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,952
... have respect
for this department.

322
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,746
Miss Gandy.

323
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,463
Miss Goldman,
are you an anarchist?

324
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,048
I decline to answer.

325
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,300
Do you deny
that you are an anarchist?

326
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,469
I decline to answer.

327
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,723
Do you believe in the overthrow
by force or violence...

328
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,223
... of the government
of the United States?

329
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,054
I refuse to answer.

330
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,560
Do you advocate the assassination
of public officials?

331
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,480
I refuse to answer.

332
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,620
This alien has refused
to answer any questions...

333
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:39,920
... pertaining to the charges
contained in the warrant...

334
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:43,241
... notwithstanding the fact that
every opportunity was afforded her.

335
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,117
I recommend deportation.

336
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,998
And just like that,
we had our precedent.

337
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:57,505
Edgar, should I arrange our travel
to Paterson on Valentine's Day?

338
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,675
Yes, of course, Miss Gandy.

339
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,475
I took the train to Paterson,
New Jersey, on February 14th.

340
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,894
If I could catch these
radicals red-handed...

341
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,031
... then the Labor Department
would have to put them...

342
00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:15,731
... all on boats back home.

343
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,442
So agents of the Bureau,
alongside local police...

344
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,405
... began raiding gathering places
of known communist radicals...

345
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,199
... all across this country.

346
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,661
These people are armed
and violent.

347
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,539
They're prepared
to kill to avoid capture.

348
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,166
Take one.
Go on.

349
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,258
- Are we allowed to use these, sir?
- These are gifts from me to you.

350
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,047
There is no law that prevents us
from using our own weapons.

351
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,883
Gentlemen, grab your guns.

352
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,388
Gentlemen, quickly.

353
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,727
Let's move.

354
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,532
Police!
This is a raid!

355
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,000
He's going for the window!
Stop him!

356
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,703
That's enough!

357
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,851
The leaflets matched exactly.

358
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,771
We'd solved the bombings.

359
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:23,501
And in the end, we arrested
nearly 4,000 communist radicals...

360
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,820
... and deported over 500 of them.

361
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:31,617
It was accomplished against great
odds and at great personal peril.

362
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:39,375
They found the counterfeiting
press, five pistols, two automatics.

363
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,621
And in Trenton...

364
00:23:40,622 --> 00:23:43,921
... they found gunpowder,
copper, brass wire, and batteries.

365
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,340
- A bomb factory.
- Yes.

366
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:52,847
120 arrests in Detroit, 41 in
Philadelphia, and 17 here so far.

367
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:56,508
But everyone in the Bureau involved
in the arrest lost their job, correct?

368
00:23:56,509 --> 00:23:57,685
Even Palmer himself?

369
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,979
Some did,
and there's the lesson.

370
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,648
You see, the bombs stopped,
and peace came.

371
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,860
The American people had
forgotten there ever was a threat.

372
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,863
So when political adversaries
attacked Palmer...

373
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,699
... for trying to protect this
nation from communism...

374
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,701
... our countrymen
allowed it to happen.

375
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:19,582
Because like today, they've forgotten
the bombs, the blood, the fear.

376
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,460
But why Palmer and not you,
if you orchestrated the raids?

377
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,340
I was 24 years old, Agent Smith.
I was just following orders.

378
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,925
I understand, sir.

379
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:34,346
And if we hadn't, you may very well
have been born into a communist state...

380
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:37,224
... rather than the country
you love today.

381
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,310
- Am I right?
- Of course, sir.

382
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,519
Hmm.

383
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:41,729
Edgar?

384
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,190
Ignore him.

385
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,900
Edgar?

386
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,904
I'm in a meeting, Mr. Tolson.
I'll be out in a moment.

387
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:53,407
Don't forget about your appointment
with the Attorney General, Edgar.

388
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:58,037
Files are not yet completed,
Mr. Tolson. Please go away.

389
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,664
Thank you.

390
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:07,087
Thank you, sir. I apologize.
I'll finish this chapter tonight.

391
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,925
Very well, Agent Smith.

392
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:23,604
In the Academy, do they tell
the story of how I got here?

393
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,982
Yes, sir. You were called into
the new Attorney General's office...

394
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,277
- Harlan Fiske Stone.
- Yes, sir, Attorney General Stone.

395
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:33,239
He called you into his office
and told you to sit down, sir.

396
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,824
Sir, there are over a dozen
vacancies in Chicago.

397
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,036
And with the robbery rates rising,
it would actually profit the Bureau...

398
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,455
... to start filling those vacancies
and make recoveries.

399
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,801
I have cabinets filled with files
on potential suspects...

400
00:25:44,802 --> 00:25:46,001
... and with
a congressional hearing...

401
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:50,631
Lower the treble, son. You didn't
call this meeting, I did. Sit down.

402
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,758
Yes, sir.

403
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:57,846
Everyone you've worked with here
is gone. And there's a reason for that.

404
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:03,143
This Bureau is of exceedingly
bad odor. Would you agree?

405
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,312
Yes, sir.

406
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,399
And, no offense, but you
seem to have no social life.

407
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:13,821
No wife, no girlfriend.
As far as I can tell, no pals at all.

408
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,075
That is accurate, sir.

409
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:22,413
And you're shamelessly distracted by
this hodgepodge fingerprinting affair.

410
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:26,301
Sir, it wouldn't be hodgepodge if
we could centralize the prints here...

411
00:26:26,302 --> 00:26:27,501
... I assure you.

412
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,837
It's a speculative science at best.

413
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,673
Yes, sir.

414
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,009
And why do they
call you Speed?

415
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,428
Who calls me that?

416
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,472
They all do,
behind your back, evidently.

417
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:47,187
I gained a reputation for delivering
groceries when I was 10 years old.

418
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:51,108
I was the fastest in the neighborhood.
It was just a nickname.

419
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,110
You sure it's not
for the way you talk?

420
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,864
Perhaps, sir.

421
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:04,204
Young man, I want you to be acting
director of the Bureau of Investigation.

422
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:11,670
I will take the job, Mr. Stone,
but only on certain conditions.

423
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,007
What are they?

424
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:19,213
The Bureau must be
divorced from politics...

425
00:27:19,214 --> 00:27:21,013
... and not be a catchall
for political hacks.

426
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,059
Recruits must be
college-educated.

427
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,062
Appointments must be
based on merit.

428
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:32,066
Promotions will be
made on proven ability.

429
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:36,403
And well, the Bureau will be
responsible only to you, sir...

430
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,072
... the Attorney General.

431
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:44,912
I wouldn't give you the job
under any other conditions.

432
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,874
That's all.
Good day.

433
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:52,711
Thank you, sir.

434
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:56,924
I am determined to summarily
dismiss from this Bureau...

435
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:00,844
... any employee whom I find
indulging in the use of intoxicants.

436
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,765
It is my belief that when a man
becomes a part of this Bureau...

437
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:10,104
... he must so conduct himself,
both officially and unofficially...

438
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,774
... as to eliminate even
the slightest possibility of criticism...

439
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,943
... as to his conduct.

440
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,948
- And what is your name, sir?
- Agent Williams, sir.

441
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,275
Pleasure to meet you,
Agent Williams.

442
00:28:22,276 --> 00:28:23,575
You too, sir.

443
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,079
And your name?

444
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,789
Agent Caffrey, sir.

445
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,056
And what is your assignment,
Agent Caffrey?

446
00:28:30,057 --> 00:28:31,520
I'm headed
to Kansas City today...

447
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:34,253
... to aid in the search for escaped
bank robber Frank Nash, sir.

448
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,505
Mmm, that is dangerous work,
and when you return...

449
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,049
... you will be rewarded
for your service to our country.

450
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:47,933
You still fancy facial hair,
Agent Stokes?

451
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,686
- The ladies appreciate it.
- Hmm.

452
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:54,189
And I suppose the ladies' opinions
are more important than the Bureau's?

453
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,399
No.

454
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,067
Sir.

455
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,279
Perhaps you are better suited
for the police force...

456
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,740
... than the Bureau
of Investigations.

457
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,493
I've been with the Department
and the Bureau for 7 years, Edgar.

458
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,945
Almost as long as you.

459
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,863
No.

460
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:14,501
You were with the old Bureau 7 years,
and that Bureau is now gone, sir.

461
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,837
And so are you.

462
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:21,133
I quickly dismissed all agents
that did not fit my standards.

463
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,927
Education, physical fitness...

464
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,013
... but above all, loyalty.

465
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:34,188
I've had two made.
Same cut, different pattern.

466
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,026
And two suits for you.
They'll be delivered on Friday.

467
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,527
Thank you, Mother.

468
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,533
It's platinum.

469
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:51,121
Six diamonds
and a star sapphire.

470
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,043
- Heh.
- It's absolutely beautiful, Mother.

471
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,461
Thank you.

472
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,467
I've told the whole neighborhood
about you. They all know.

473
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,554
No, I shouldn't,
I've been gaining weight, Mother.

474
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:11,809
It's solid weight. There's nothing
wrong with solid weight on a man.

475
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,813
- All right.
- I'm so incredibly proud of you, Edgar.

476
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,404
I'm starting an album for you.

477
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,575
I'm gonna put everything in it.
This is just the beginning.

478
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:32,023
"Johnny Hoover appointed
acting director...

479
00:30:32,024 --> 00:30:35,123
... of the Bureau of Investigations."

480
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,750
Can you read that?

481
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,006
You proud of your uncle?

482
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,315
Gentlemen.

483
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,280
I want to introduce you.
Come with me.

484
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,742
Edgar, good to see you.

485
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,286
Good to see you, Lawrence.

486
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,955
I'd like to introduce you
to Mr. Clyde Tolson.

487
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,916
Graduated from George Washington
University tonight with a law degree.

488
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,126
Hmm.

489
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,627
Congratulations, Mr. Tolson.

490
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,198
Thank you, Mr. Hoover.

491
00:31:22,395 --> 00:31:24,798
I believe you are one of
our most distinguished alumni.

492
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:29,235
I did, yes. I, uh... do have
a degree from the school, yes.

493
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,958
I was just admiring
your suit, Mr. Tolson.

494
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,758
You should take a lesson
from him, Lawrence.

495
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,477
Thank you, sir. It's a custom cut,
from Garfinkel's department store.

496
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,104
Ah.

497
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,650
Do you have a card,
Mr. Tolson?

498
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:46,236
I do, yes, of course.

499
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,488
Here you go.

500
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,532
Good to see you, Lawrence.

501
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:52,659
Thank you, sir.

502
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,009
"Well-educated,
highly recommended...

503
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,709
... willing to guarantee
five years service."

504
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,545
"Has a family in New York
and a new baby."

505
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:04,755
No interview.

506
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,507
The family in New York
or the baby?

507
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,170
Miss Gandy,
five years is not enough.

508
00:32:09,171 --> 00:32:11,470
We need men willing
to dedicate their lives.

509
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,138
How many is that so far?

510
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:18,560
- That's 320 denied and 21 interviews.
- Hmm.

511
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:22,856
Did we receive an application
from a Mr. Tolson?

512
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,192
Yes.

513
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:31,156
Yes, his report states
he has confidence, poise...

514
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,742
... his diction is excellent.

515
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:38,413
But although physically fitted for it,
might be displeased with rugged work.

516
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:41,000
His only interest in the Bureau
is to gain experience...

517
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,876
... that would benefit
a private law practice.

518
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:46,780
And he has no interest in being
here for any period of time...

519
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,675
... which would render
employment speculative.

520
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,885
Hmm.

521
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,763
He did receive
a letter of recommendation...

522
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:58,392
... from the executive assistant
of the Secretary of War.

523
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,019
That's fantastic, Miss Gandy.

524
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:05,193
Yes. It mentions here
that Mr. Tolson...

525
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:08,193
... showed no particular
interest in women.

526
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,876
Then again, some
of our best agents excel...

527
00:33:12,877 --> 00:33:16,076
... because they have
no family encumbrance.

528
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,414
Yes, you're right.
Set up an interview.

529
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,544
You know what the problem is,
Miss Gandy?

530
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,714
These men, they don't...
they don't look up to me.

531
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,048
Of course they do.

532
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:35,137
I don't mean figuratively.
I mean they don't look up to me.

533
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:39,266
Well, if you could conduct the entire
interview from behind your desk...

534
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:44,646
... instead of walking about
the office, I could correct that.

535
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,481
Indeed.

536
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,579
Miss Gandy, suppose I had
private information on someone...

537
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:56,324
... in a position of power,
harmful information.

538
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,803
It goes against my very nature
to destroy such information...

539
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,873
... but I don't trust it
in the general files either.

540
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,626
Could I trust it with you?

541
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:10,881
If we were to create
a confidential file?

542
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,508
Of course, Edgar.

543
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:16,762
Thank you, Miss Gandy.

544
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,101
Information is power.

545
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,229
It protected us from the
communists in 1919...

546
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,034
... and since has been vigilantly
collected, organized...

547
00:34:29,035 --> 00:34:32,534
... and maintained by our FBI.

548
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,489
Attorney General
Kennedy's office.

549
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:44,122
Did you always have this fireplace
or did you have it put in?

550
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,882
It was put in.

551
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:48,335
What were you doing with
wiretaps in that house?

552
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:53,000
You asked that I pursue this
organized crime element...

553
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:56,176
... Mr. Kennedy, and I did so,
sir, with diligence.

554
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,137
- Do you use the fireplace?
- Rarely.

555
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,847
Who else has heard the recording?

556
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:05,352
I have filed the matter
personal and confidential.

557
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,646
I'm the only person
with access to it.

558
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,900
Mr. Hoover, I asked you
to pursue a real threat.

559
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,695
Instead, you've publicly denied
the existence of organized crime...

560
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,198
... and now this gross display
of intimidation.

561
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:22,035
Mr. Attorney General,
I was only following orders.

562
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,454
We bugged the basement
of a home in Los Angeles...

563
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,541
... that was a known gathering
place for lawbreakers.

564
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,929
How was I to know that
an East German communist...

565
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,129
... would be down there...

566
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:36,049
... having sex with your brother,
the President of the United States?

567
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:40,637
Do not shoot the messenger, sir.
I am here to protect you both.

568
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,472
Remember that.

569
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,018
What do you want from me?

570
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,732
If this information
were to go public...

571
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,737
... it would create widespread distrust
in your brother's leadership capabilities.

572
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:01,741
And above all else, I hold the
well-being of our country paramount.

573
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,536
So how may I help you,
Mr. Hoover?

574
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:09,583
Well, if I am to pursue the elements
that you consider a threat...

575
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,420
... I humbly request that you allow
me the same power and access...

576
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,423
... to follow the groups that
I see as an immediate threat.

577
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,925
It's not 1920 anymore.

578
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,929
You know who
Stanley Levinson is, sir?

579
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,724
A lawyer.

580
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,103
A white, communist lawyer
organizing at the highest levels...

581
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,022
... including the SCLC.

582
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,940
Now, their group is growing.

583
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,318
They are entirely self-serving...

584
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:40,113
... and their leadership is openly
critical of this department here.

585
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,032
Did you read
the memos that I sent?

586
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,451
No, no, I can't say that I have.

587
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,455
It says right here, Mr. Kennedy.

588
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,290
They claim we are...

589
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,919
... "unable to get convictions in even
the worst, most heinous crimes"...

590
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:57,214
... and that we have "faltered under
the pressure, complexities...

591
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,674
... and responsibilities
of our office," in print.

592
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:03,553
- Right here in The Washington Post.
- You can't bear a little criticism?

593
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,972
Well, it depends on
what their aim is.

594
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,308
They are gaining
considerable power.

595
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,353
Their priorities are singularly
focused on their own issues.

596
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,730
They are trying to incite revolt.

597
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,484
Frankly, they sound more critical
of your office than mine.

598
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,112
There's a new face to communism,
Edgar, and this isn't it.

599
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,825
Communism is a foreign
threat now, not domestic.

600
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:31,831
Mr. Kennedy, before
you were even born...

601
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:36,294
... I heard that very same argument
from a Mr. Mitchell Palmer.

602
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,839
Do you know what it took
to change his mind?

603
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,174
A bomb.

604
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:45,428
If he would have sat in his rocking
chair five more minutes in 1919...

605
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:49,599
... we'd have been lucky enough
to find an intact index finger.

606
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:53,144
Now, I do not want that to happen
to you or your brother, sir.

607
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:57,190
There's no reason we both
can't get what we want.

608
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:01,695
We can wage a war on two fronts, sir.
You understand?

609
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,533
You can go now, Mr. Hoover.

610
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:10,996
Yes, sir.

611
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,541
Please leave the transcripts
here with me.

612
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,003
Yes, sir.

613
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,803
Oh, and feel free and share them
with your brother.

614
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:33,710
Oh, let him know that I have
a copy of my own in safekeeping.

615
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,954
- Uh.
- Your 4:00 is here, sir.

616
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,540
Thank you, Miss Gandy.
Send him right in, thank you.

617
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:03,214
Please, have a seat, Mr. Tolson.

618
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,193
Mr. Hoover, thank you
so much for this opportunity.

619
00:39:05,394 --> 00:39:07,093
Yes.
Please.

620
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,596
- Have a seat.
- Thank you, sir.

621
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:13,224
There were several problems
with your application, Mr. Tolson...

622
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:16,311
... not the least of which is the fact
that you did not show...

623
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,730
... the proper requirement
to the Bureau...

624
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:24,069
... nor the proper dedication
to protecting the American people...

625
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,278
... and the American way.

626
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,864
May I remind you
that this is not a platform...

627
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,451
... to a fatter paycheck in
private practice, Mr. Tolson?

628
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,291
Is there something the matter,
Mr. Tolson?

629
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,460
No, sir.

630
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,630
Is exercise a requirement
for all agents, sir?

631
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:49,803
Yes. All our agents need to be
in top physical condition.

632
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:54,307
We must outsmart and outmatch
the public enemy at every turn.

633
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,017
Yes, of course.

634
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:59,479
So, uh... what routine
do you do, sir?

635
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:03,108
Push-ups, sit-ups, and squatting.

636
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,777
I see.

637
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,654
Would you like me to fix
the curtain, Mr. Hoover?

638
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,989
Or perhaps I could
open a window.

639
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:12,617
I always prefer a little bit
of air after exercise.

640
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,702
Don't you?

641
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,996
If it would please you.

642
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:21,126
And, sir, where I may fall short
in terms of résumé...

643
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:25,797
... I apparently far exceed
the rest in terms of honesty.

644
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,591
I didn't lie to get
this appointment, sir.

645
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,219
Like the rest, yes, I would like
to start a private practice eventually...

646
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:37,016
... but I could be persuaded otherwise
if the right opportunities were to arise.

647
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,019
Hmm.

648
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,107
Fair enough, Mr. Tolson.

649
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,485
Fair enough.

650
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,292
These sleeves seem to be
the correct length.

651
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,182
All right, sir, I found you
two tie options.

652
00:41:04,183 --> 00:41:06,539
This one is a bit more fashion
forward, a little bit louder...

653
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,090
... but I think it would complement
this suit and cut and fabric.

654
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,800
I think it's a bit too loud,
don't you think?

655
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,678
Too loud? Okay, which is why
I found this one, the backup.

656
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:17,058
It's a bit more directorial,
a little bit more...

657
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:18,558
It's a little bit more
reserved, I agree.

658
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:22,729
Let's keep this as a second option,
please. Thank you, Clyde.

659
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,733
Are you Mr. John Hoover?

660
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,193
I am.
Is there a problem?

661
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,489
It seems there's a Mr. John Hoover
whose credit has gone bad with us.

662
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,199
That would appear to be you.

663
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:36,993
That is not me, sir, on my word.

664
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,856
My mother calls me Edgar,
my niece calls me JE...

665
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:41,956
... and I sign John E,
not John.

666
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:45,877
Well, sir, if you're a friend
of Mr. Tolson's...

667
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:49,589
... just choose one name
and reapply.

668
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,591
All right.

669
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,551
Thank you very much.

670
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:04,938
Morning, Miss Gandy.

671
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,649
What?
You don't like it?

672
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:12,904
Mr. Hoover, there's been
a massacre in Kansas City.

673
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,074
One of our own?

674
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,620
Special Agent Caffrey?

675
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,372
Let him have it!

676
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,793
By 1930, the communist threat
had been beaten back...

677
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,630
... but the Depression had hit
and there was a new threat.

678
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,508
The bank robber, the car thief,
and the kidnapper.

679
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:38,972
But, unfortunately, as with communism,
America didn't react with scorn.

680
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:42,225
They gave the American
gangster admiration.

681
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,894
And the defiance by desperate,
armed criminals...

682
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:49,190
... of the forces of society and
civilization can no longer be ignored.

683
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:53,236
Bugs Moran and Al Capone
top the list of public enemies.

684
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,531
Look around you.
They could be anywhere.

685
00:42:56,699 --> 00:43:01,286
May I remind you that the Bureau of
Investigation seeks to be your protector.

686
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:04,664
It belongs to you. It is as close
to you as your nearest telephone.

687
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,500
And with your help...

688
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:11,462
Warner Bros. presents
a Vitaphone production of...

689
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,339
... "The Public Enemy."

690
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:17,677
James Cagney plays
public enemy number one.

691
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,513
- Why, you.
- Aah!

692
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,267
There you go with
that wishing stuff again.

693
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,227
Maybe you found someone
you like better.

694
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,524
Coming soon to your
neighborhood theater.

695
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:33,860
Fantastic.

696
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:39,365
That summer, a single crime
opened the door to set things right.

697
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,827
Do you know what
that was, Mr. Jones?

698
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,329
Sorry, sir, what was that?

699
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:47,665
Who is the most famous man
of the 20th Century thus far?

700
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,209
Joe McCarthy, sir?

701
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:54,589
Mr. McCarthy
was an opportunist...

702
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,175
... not a patriot, Mr. Jones.

703
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,724
Who is the most famous man
of the 20th Century thus far?

704
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,226
The most famous?

705
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,896
Is that you, sir?

706
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:20,740
Well, I suppose his notoriety
depends on the field that he is in.

707
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:24,077
His field was in the clouds.

708
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:27,205
Well, then
Charles Lindbergh, sir.

709
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,552
Yes?

710
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,681
Charles Lindbergh's baby has
been kidnapped from his home.

711
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:48,634
Send officers from Trenton.
I'll be on the first train.

712
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:54,774
What is it?

713
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:00,738
Charles Lindbergh...
Lindbergh's baby's been kidnapped.

714
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,200
You've got to find him, Edgar.

715
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,954
He has to be brought home alive.

716
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,248
Yes, Mother.

717
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,294
Yes, Mother, I know.

718
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:22,927
When we arrived at Mr. Lindbergh's
home that morning in 1932...

719
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:26,431
... we began an investigation that
would forever change our Bureau.

720
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:29,192
This morning alone, we've heard
from the Pennsylvania Railroad...

721
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:32,479
... Will Rogers, President Hoover,
Governor Roosevelt...

722
00:45:32,482 --> 00:45:34,897
... the Customs Department,
the U.S. Mail, and the Boy Scouts.

723
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,749
All of you.
Get off of that dirt.

724
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,485
You're trampling evidence.
Immediately! Get off!

725
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:42,613
There's nothing there. We checked.
No defined footprints.

726
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:44,991
It appears he was wearing
fabric on his shoes.

727
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,827
You don't think the size of the prints
could have held some value?

728
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:48,930
How did he get up there?

729
00:45:48,931 --> 00:45:51,330
Are there marks on the
window and wall as well?

730
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,458
There was a ladder.
We found it 100 yards away.

731
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,084
We moved it inside.

732
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,419
You moved it?

733
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,171
Yes, for safekeeping.

734
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,300
Well, congratulations,
Mr. Schwarzkopf.

735
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:02,341
You have completely
contaminated the crime scene.

736
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,594
Now if you will, get your boots
off this property. Thank you.

737
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,054
And what right do you have
to be here, Mister uh...

738
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,849
J. Edgar Hoover, director
of the Bureau of Investigation.

739
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:13,019
We've been sent by President Hoover
directly to ensure the investigation...

740
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:16,272
The president has authorized access
to all documents and evidence.

741
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,876
Mr. Hoover,
you're free to observe...

742
00:46:17,877 --> 00:46:20,276
... but New Jersey's
not the president's domain.

743
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:24,030
And where is Mr. Lindbergh? I'd
like to hear his opinion on the matter.

744
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,282
- Mr. Lindbergh's around back.
- After you, sir.

745
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,117
He's been up all night
as you can imagine.

746
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,329
Mr. Lindbergh himself
came down to meet me.

747
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:36,542
He shook my hand and expressed his
gratitude and faith in our young Bureau.

748
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,295
He fell five feet.

749
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,713
Who did?

750
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,218
The kidnapper,
with the child in his arms.

751
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,179
That's speculation,
Mr. Hoover.

752
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:52,017
Mr. Lindbergh, sir, if the ladder
had split while the person...

753
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,017
... was on their way up...

754
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,978
... it would have collapsed.
You see, it was a miscalculation.

755
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,291
It was meant to bear the weight
of a man going up...

756
00:46:58,292 --> 00:47:00,691
... but not the weight of a man
and child going down.

757
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:01,901
We have other theories.

758
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,028
Where is the ransom note?

759
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,197
Of course.

760
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,368
And you are touching that
with your bare hands as well?

761
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,577
We checked.

762
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:12,922
There are none of those
finger imprints...

763
00:47:12,923 --> 00:47:15,122
... that you fancy so valuable,
Mr. Hoover

764
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,083
Please hand it over,
Mr. Schwarzkopf.

765
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,919
That's Colonel Schwarzkopf.

766
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:25,216
"Have 50,000 dollars ready,"
spelled R-E-D-Y.

767
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:29,011
"We will inform you where," spelled
W-E-R-E, "to deliver the money"...

768
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,513
... spelled M-O-N-Y.

769
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:34,851
"We warn you for making anything
public or for notify the police.

770
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:39,772
Indication for all letters are signature,"
S-I-N-G, "singnature."

771
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,275
Three holes.

772
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,945
I want this letter and the ladder.

773
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,581
There's no federal jurisdiction.
I've showed what you asked for.

774
00:47:48,582 --> 00:47:50,867
- It's time for you to go.
- Mr. Lindbergh, please...

775
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,212
Mr. Hoover,
thank you very much.

776
00:47:52,213 --> 00:47:54,412
As you can see, we have
everything under control.

777
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,372
Thank you, gentlemen.

778
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,624
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Lindbergh.

779
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,085
Clyde.

780
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:12,930
Clyde, I'm afraid for his boy.

781
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,641
He trusts the local police
more than us.

782
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,310
He thinks we're all fools.

783
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,397
He'll go around them too.

784
00:48:19,398 --> 00:48:21,397
He's going to bargain
with the kidnappers.

785
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,611
President Hoover called me
the morning the child was taken...

786
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,947
... and asked me to do whatever was
in my power to solve this crime.

787
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:33,075
But do you know what all the power
of the Bureau of Investigation means...

788
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:38,205
... without federal laws, without arms,
without the ability to make arrests?

789
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,207
It means nothing.

790
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:43,961
Mr. Chairman, I urge passage
of the Lindbergh Law...

791
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,505
... making kidnapping
a federal offense.

792
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:49,676
To immediately deliver all
the fingerprints in this country...

793
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:53,012
... to my office so that
we may create a central file.

794
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,349
To help arm our agents
so that they have a fighting chance...

795
00:48:56,516 --> 00:49:00,353
... against the submachine guns of some
of the most dangerous characters...

796
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,480
... in the history
of American criminality.

797
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:06,067
And I urge you to do this
in the name of Little Lindy.

798
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:09,528
Because if he can be taken,
then what child is safe?

799
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:15,451
And if we cannot aid in his
safe return, then what use are we?

800
00:49:37,116 --> 00:49:39,300
Every fingerprint
from the local authorities...

801
00:49:39,301 --> 00:49:44,522
... across the country began flowing in.
Finally, we had a centralized system.

802
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,232
What is it, Edgar?

803
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,227
The last of the fingerprints
came in from Chicago.

804
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,818
You know our new president has...

805
00:49:53,819 --> 00:49:57,118
... scheduled a meeting
with me, Miss Gandy?

806
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:02,748
Do you know that there are talks
of reorganizing the Bureau?

807
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,668
Yes, I've heard similar whispers.

808
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,003
Hmm.

809
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,754
Have you?

810
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:15,194
Miss Gandy, do you remember
that file we created on his wife?

811
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,846
Mrs. Roosevelt?

812
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,597
Yes.

813
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,933
Will you make a copy
for me, please?

814
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,602
Yes, of course.

815
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,106
Thank you, Miss Gandy.

816
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,934
Lindbergh hired criminals
to find his son.

817
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,650
Off the desk now, Agent Garrison,
follow me.

818
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:07,730
Yes, sir.

819
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,983
He even got an offer from Al Capone
to help pay the ransom money...

820
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,871
... but in the end,
he employed an eccentric...

821
00:51:13,881 --> 00:51:15,071
... by the name of John Condon...

822
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:19,492
... who placed a newspaper ad to act
as a go-between with the kidnappers.

823
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:22,078
Now, was Condon
a criminal too?

824
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:25,623
He most certainly wasn't an agent
of the law, Mr. Garrison.

825
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,333
Why are you doing this?

826
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,920
So a mother may have
her baby again.

827
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:34,673
And you may know that the
American people are grateful...

828
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:37,968
... for the honor bestowed upon
them by your pluck and daring.

829
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,015
And how do we know
the kidnapper...

830
00:51:40,016 --> 00:51:42,515
... is the same that wrote
the letters that you have?

831
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,770
The symbol, uh... matches the
original letter's symbol, doesn't it?

832
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,484
What is it, Mr. Lindbergh?

833
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:59,698
In a moment
of thoughtlessness...

834
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,034
... I showed the symbol to some
other men who offered to help...

835
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:05,037
... and I'm not sure
that they were trustworthy.

836
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,165
I'm not sure anyone
is trustworthy anymore.

837
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,977
You should know I'll be having
your letters analyzed...

838
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:15,381
... to make sure that they
are from the same author.

839
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:19,552
And while Mr. Lindbergh
placed his faith in hoodlums...

840
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:23,222
... we began cultivating the one
thing criminals couldn't fight...

841
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,057
... with all the guns in the world.

842
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:28,053
Gentlemen, please leave this room.
Clear all these tables.

843
00:52:28,054 --> 00:52:29,353
Time to go, now.

844
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,688
Where can we smoke, sir?

845
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,439
It's not my concern.
Make sure it's out of my sight.

846
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,734
- Mr. Osborne, tell us what you need.
- Uh... bright lights, a microscope...

847
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:38,404
... measuring instruments,
magnifying glasses. A, uh... projector.

848
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,732
You have the full resources
of the Bureau. Don't be shy.

849
00:52:40,733 --> 00:52:41,532
A child's life depends on it.

850
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,826
Okay, paper samples from
every regional manufacturer.

851
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,621
Mr. Osborne, this is Mr. Tolson.

852
00:52:45,622 --> 00:52:47,621
Supply Mr. Osborne
whatever he needs...

853
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:51,333
... to conclude without a doubt that
these letters came from the same author.

854
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,043
Hmm?

855
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,047
Gentlemen, please.
Thank you.

856
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,887
- Should we tell the Attorney General?
- Why? So he can say no a third time?

857
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:05,007
Just post a sign, like this one.

858
00:53:05,008 --> 00:53:06,807
What would you
like it to say, "keep out"?

859
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:09,560
"The Bureau of Investigations
Technical Laboratory."

860
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,631
Have it carved in wood
and nailed to the wall.

861
00:53:11,632 --> 00:53:13,731
If he wants it gone, he'll
have to tear it out himself

862
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,901
It's time we at least have
one thing the bad guys don't.

863
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,110
Decorating skills?

864
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:19,820
Science, Clyde.
Science.

865
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:24,116
Uh... the ink is different,
but the handwriting is a match.

866
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:26,079
Whoever Mr. Condon
is corresponding with...

867
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,079
... is the person
who wrote the original note.

868
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:31,207
Or Condon wrote
all the notes himself.

869
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,001
Lindbergh is planning on using
Condon to deliver the ransom.

870
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,629
- May have already happened.
- Call the Internal Revenue Service.

871
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:40,300
Get them to Lindbergh's home.
I insist that all those bills be marked.

872
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:41,884
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

873
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,887
Is that all, Mr. Hoover?
I have a 2:30 pm class to teach.

874
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,139
No, you don't.
Consider your pay doubled.

875
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:52,144
You work for your country now,
Mr. Osborne. Congratulations.

876
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,148
Doctor!

877
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,160
Have you gotted the money?

878
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:11,580
I can't bring the money
till I see the baby.

879
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,964
I promise you
there's no police.

880
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,424
It's too dangerous.

881
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:32,184
Stop!
Stop this now!

882
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,980
No one's gonna harm you.

883
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:37,898
If they catch me, they will.

884
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,442
No, they only want the child.

885
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,988
They'll give me 30 years if I'm caught.
They could burn me.

886
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,614
No, no.

887
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:46,865
I didn't do it.

888
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,659
I'm only the messenger.

889
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,995
Eh!

890
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:52,997
What if the baby is dead?

891
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,874
Would I burn if the baby is dead?

892
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:00,045
Why would we be meeting
if the baby was dead?

893
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:03,307
Place another ad in the paper
when you have the money.

894
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:14,226
So if a ransom had to be paid,
we needed those bills traced.

895
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:18,564
We brought in the IRS, and for his
own good, we had to force his hand.

896
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,567
I thought gold notes were going
out of circulation, Mr. Irey.

897
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,068
That's our hope.

898
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:25,112
It will make these bills
more identifiable.

899
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,865
I have no need for the money,
Mr. Hoover, I just want my son.

900
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:32,369
This isn't just about your son,
Mr. Lindbergh.

901
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:36,415
If these kidnappers go free, then
no child in this country will be safe.

902
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:41,378
That's why I've assembled a 26-man team,
headed by Special Agent Sisk here.

903
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:45,758
And if they find out you're involved,
I may never see my son again.

904
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:49,470
Mr. Lindbergh, sir,
we will not pursue a single lead...

905
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,930
... until your child is safe
in his mother's arms.

906
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:54,850
You have my word, sir.

907
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:05,944
The kidnapping of Charles
A. Lindbergh Jr. was a tragedy...

908
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:08,697
... not only to Colonel and
Mrs. Lindbergh, but to the nation.

909
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,950
His abduction from his Hopewell
home was a challenge to America.

910
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:14,870
This ladder, the only clue
to the kidnapping, was homemade.

911
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,956
Let the developments in the Lindbergh
baby case start a new drive...

912
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:21,001
... to wipe out the stain, not
only of that wanton kidnapping...

913
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:24,088
... but of all
kidnapping and crimes.

914
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,217
Hey, doctor!

915
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,262
Give your word
not to open for six hours.

916
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:35,599
Thank you.

917
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,943
I talked him
out of 20,000 dollars.

918
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:49,488
I'd prefer him happy than save
the money. I don't want to upset him.

919
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:51,824
Where is the baby?

920
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,576
I promised not to open
this for six hours.

921
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,329
You gave your word, I did not.

922
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:03,293
"The boy is on boat Nelly.
It is a small boat, 28 feet long."

923
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:06,505
"Two persons are on the boat.
They are innocent."

924
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,877
"You'll find the boat
between Horseneck's Beach...

925
00:57:08,878 --> 00:57:11,677
... and Gay Head
near Elizabeth Island."

926
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,846
That's Nantucket, right?

927
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,059
What was in the boat?

928
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,602
There was no boat.

929
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,439
Lindbergh didn't trust us.
He wanted to do things his way.

930
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:27,192
And who can blame him?
No one respected us at that time.

931
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,069
Mr. Hoover, we've been calling.

932
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,863
Edgar.

933
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,659
Time to go, Agent Garrison.
Right now.

934
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,705
The Attorney General
has authorized your wiretaps.

935
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,707
Very good, Miss Gandy.

936
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:46,712
Edgar, are you sure about this?
Once you do this, Edgar, it's done.

937
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,274
When I prove myself correct...

938
00:57:48,275 --> 00:57:50,674
... we will have saved this country
another radical revolution.

939
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,509
History will remember that, Clyde.

940
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:53,886
But if you are wrong...

941
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:57,389
... history will remember it as an
illegal move over a petty grudge.

942
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:00,517
Do you consider our reputation
petty, Mr. Tolson?

943
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:03,312
- No, I...
- Then order the wires.

944
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,650
Can we at least
discuss this over dinner?

945
00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:08,150
After you've ordered the wires!

946
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:11,987
Yes, sir.

947
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,335
The director's on his way.

948
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:51,685
- Ahem.
- After you.

949
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,092
Wait, please.

950
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:24,768
- Harvey's Restaurant, sir?
- No, to the White House.

951
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:37,531
We were in the midst
of a Great Depression...

952
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:40,492
... and breaths away from
history's worst war.

953
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:44,496
We needed more power to protect,
but as with every new president...

954
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:49,167
... this Bureau's future and my very
job was being drawn into question.

955
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:51,537
The president is ready
to see you now.

956
00:59:51,938 --> 00:59:52,754
Alrighty.

957
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,473
Come in.
Have a seat, Mr. Hoover.

958
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:09,806
It's the same dance each time.
They make me wait.

959
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,160
They imagine I'm sweating...

960
01:00:11,161 --> 01:00:14,860
... that they're gonna show me
who's boss, and I play along.

961
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,653
Thank you.

962
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,697
And then did you show him
the transcript?

963
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,975
No. He didn't want to read it.
That was unique.

964
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,202
He wanted me
to tell him about it.

965
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,079
What?
How you came across it?

966
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:27,875
No, I explained to him up front...

967
01:00:27,876 --> 01:00:30,375
... we never expected
to find Mrs. Roosevelt...

968
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,961
... in the bedroom of
a known communist agitator...

969
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:36,548
... much less having what sounded
like an intimate moment.

970
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:39,718
That I needed his advice
on how to proceed.

971
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:42,346
I wanted to let him know
he had an ally.

972
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,514
Before he had a chance
to ask you to resign.

973
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:45,932
Exactly.

974
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,894
When I was finished,
he simply pushed the file aside...

975
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:53,315
... as if he was
unconcerned with it.

976
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:57,361
Clyde, the President of
the United States is afraid.

977
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,072
What, he's afraid of you?

978
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:04,117
Of a potential invasion
from abroad.

979
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:07,579
We'll have two glasses
of your finest champagne.

980
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,206
Of course, Mr. Hoover.

981
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,584
- Ahem.
- You're drinking now?

982
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,753
We're celebrating, Clyde.
We're celebrating.

983
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:18,131
You know I feel I could trust
you with anything, right?

984
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:19,925
Well, I'd like to think so.

985
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,971
The president signed
a secret order...

986
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:27,432
... granting me increased
power of surveillance...

987
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:32,354
... secret surveillance of communists
and radicals, without warrant.

988
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,106
Is that legal?

989
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:36,692
Sometimes you need
to bend the rules a little...

990
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:39,277
... in order to keep
your country safe, right?

991
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:41,507
And to make sure
I hadn't heard it wrong...

992
01:01:41,508 --> 01:01:43,907
... I clarified this with
Secretary of State Hull.

993
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,912
And he said, and I quote...

994
01:01:45,913 --> 01:01:48,412
... "You go ahead and
investigate those cocksuckers."

995
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:52,708
- Vulgar.
- Hmm, agreed.

996
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,712
Clyde...

997
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,464
... I've been meaning
to ask you something.

998
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,466
Feel free.

999
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:05,804
I need someone who understands
what's at stake here...

1000
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,264
... you understand?

1001
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:09,975
Someone who I can trust...

1002
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,978
... an associate director
of the Bureau.

1003
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,606
Now, I know you've only been
in your current position for what...

1004
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:16,756
... 12 months now?

1005
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:18,650
Oh, almost 18 now, sir.

1006
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,236
You're missing my point, Clyde.

1007
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,488
I want you to be
my number-two man.

1008
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,077
I'm not much
for the spotlight, Edgar.

1009
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:34,374
I need you, Clyde.

1010
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:36,501
Do you understand?
I need you.

1011
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:41,631
On one condition.

1012
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:45,260
Good day or bad,
whether we agree or disagree...

1013
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:49,347
... we never miss a lunch
or a dinner together.

1014
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,684
Well, I would have it
no other way.

1015
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,488
Hey, pull over.

1016
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:07,949
- Only a half a mile to Mount Rose.
- Can't wait.

1017
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:39,064
Orville!

1018
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:57,415
In the end, the child's body
was found just within sight...

1019
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,668
... of Mr. Lindbergh's home.

1020
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,921
The body was blackened...

1021
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:06,049
... the left leg missing
from the knee down.

1022
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,594
There was a visible
fracture on the skull.

1023
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:13,265
He'd suffered a violent blow to the
head, I told them months ago, Mother.

1024
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:17,727
He must've fallen on the way
down with the baby in his arms.

1025
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:21,231
We are the sinners, Edgar.

1026
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:29,314
We tolerated lawlessness in the land
until it grew to diabolical proportions.

1027
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:33,952
The baby's blood is on
all our hands, Edgar.

1028
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:37,497
On your hands, Edgar.

1029
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,213
Yes, Mother.

1030
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:00,353
Six weeks after the kidnapping...

1031
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:02,355
... Congress passed
the Lindbergh Law...

1032
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:05,275
... making kidnapping
a federal offense.

1033
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:09,321
The right to make arrests followed
and the right to bear arms.

1034
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:13,950
So I continued collecting the finest
scientific minds in the country.

1035
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:20,123
He claims to be the world
expert on wood analysis.

1036
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:21,819
It's easy to be the expert...

1037
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:24,419
... if you're the only person
in the world with any interest.

1038
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,922
He does also claim he can tell
as much from a cut of wood...

1039
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:29,257
- ... as a doctor can from an autopsy.
- Ah.

1040
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,843
He has, um... social difficulties.

1041
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:34,179
He is mentally ill, isn't he?

1042
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:37,682
He's only as mad as you are.
Sir.

1043
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:41,399
This was supposed to be a
temporary inconvenience, Mr. Hoover.

1044
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,605
If you want your Sherlock Holmes
playing time, I suggest...

1045
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,358
Where do you suggest
we go, sir, where?

1046
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:48,443
I suggest you take your case
to Congress.

1047
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:49,903
Fine, sir.
Have it your way.

1048
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:53,091
I'll just tell the American people we
could not solve the Lindbergh case...

1049
01:05:53,092 --> 01:05:54,991
... because we could not afford
the proper laboratories...

1050
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:58,078
... and the Attorney General
wouldn't allow us to use his lounge.

1051
01:05:58,245 --> 01:06:01,706
Fine. Now get your science
fair project out of here.

1052
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:03,625
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.

1053
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,295
Gentlemen, keep working.

1054
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:10,507
Mr. Tolson, let's get
the president on the phone.

1055
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:14,922
The depravations
of vicious outlaws...

1056
01:06:14,923 --> 01:06:17,722
... roving from state to state
like packs of wolves...

1057
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:20,600
... amounts to an actual
armed invasion of America.

1058
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:24,521
We must outsmart and outwit
the criminal, foreign and domestic.

1059
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:28,650
They have chemists building bombs.
We need chemists tracing their efforts.

1060
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,569
We must have the most advanced
force in the world...

1061
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:34,155
... if we are to have the
safest nation on earth.

1062
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:37,909
And, please, gentlemen, let us not
for a moment lose sight of our goals.

1063
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:39,536
To protect the honest citizen...

1064
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:43,581
... to teach the criminal that
regardless of his subterfuges...

1065
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:46,334
... his twisting, his squirming
and slimy wriggling...

1066
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:49,796
... he cannot escape the one
inexorable rule of law enforcement...

1067
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:51,923
... that you can't get away with it.

1068
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,758
Thank you.

1069
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:54,926
Thank you, Mr. Hoover.

1070
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:58,016
But your agency is already
one of the most...

1071
01:06:58,017 --> 01:07:00,516
... well-funded in Washington,
is it not?

1072
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,084
Yes, that is true, sir,
but our...

1073
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:06,771
... car and bank robbery recoveries
totaled 6.5 million last year...

1074
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:09,399
... and our budget is only,
well, two million.

1075
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:13,111
Unlike other departments in
Washington, we actually run a profit.

1076
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,782
We cannot possibly quantify
the value of our successes...

1077
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:21,037
... with the hoodlums Pretty Boy
Floyd, Baby Face Nelson...

1078
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:24,330
... Machine Gun Kelly and
other hoodlums of that nature.

1079
01:07:24,498 --> 01:07:27,928
Mr. Hoover, is it true that you
directly or indirectly...

1080
01:07:27,929 --> 01:07:30,128
... spend the Bureau's
money on advertising?

1081
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:36,301
We are not permitted to engage
in advertising of any kind, sir. No.

1082
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:38,072
But you take part,
for instance...

1083
01:07:38,073 --> 01:07:40,972
... in the making of
radio shows and comic books.

1084
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,641
I've listened to several
of these G-Men programs.

1085
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:48,063
Your picture seems to be shown in
conjunction with them quite frequently.

1086
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:53,193
We declined emphatically to lend
any form of endorsement...

1087
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,073
... had nothing to do
with their production...

1088
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:58,073
... furnished no advice,
technical or otherwise.

1089
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,451
Well, the very advertisement
says that broadcasts were...

1090
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:05,830
..."true reflections, as contained
in the official records...

1091
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:09,751
... based on actual cases from the files
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation...

1092
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,961
... Saturday night at 8:00."

1093
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,673
Mr. Hoover, what are your
exact qualifications...

1094
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:18,343
... for your position
of leadership in this Bureau?

1095
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:19,761
My qualifications, sir?

1096
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:23,807
Nineteen years with the
Department of Justice. Nineteen.

1097
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:25,517
Twelve as director.

1098
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:29,312
In all that time,
you ever make an arrest yourself?

1099
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:35,443
I have made investigations.
I administer several cases at once.

1100
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,029
Well, that's not what I asked.

1101
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:41,267
The comic books show you
with a machine gun, making arrests.

1102
01:08:41,268 --> 01:08:42,867
Is that just fiction?

1103
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:52,377
I am responsible for
thousands of arrests, sir.

1104
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:56,881
So you admit it is pure fiction.

1105
01:08:57,466 --> 01:09:02,220
In fact, it wasn't you who hunted down
and captured John Dillinger at all.

1106
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:05,140
It was Agent Purvis.
Is that correct?

1107
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:10,520
I was in charge of all
of those investigations...

1108
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:14,899
... but, no, sir, I have not
personally made an arrest.

1109
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,241
Any other questions, gentlemen?

1110
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:26,369
Let's bring it to a vote.

1111
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:31,332
Put those away.

1112
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:37,839
Well, that didn't go well.

1113
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,225
We spend our lives
working for justice...

1114
01:09:39,226 --> 01:09:41,225
... and the thanks we get
is a political attack?

1115
01:09:41,226 --> 01:09:44,429
What does he expect, crimes to go
unsolved? Why is he fighting me?

1116
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,681
I want you to start a file on
Senator McKellar immediately.

1117
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,641
I want four agents
on him at all times.

1118
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:50,069
I want to know
what's in his trash...

1119
01:09:50,070 --> 01:09:51,969
... and I want you to
photograph him at every dinner.

1120
01:09:52,337 --> 01:09:55,607
Don't get in the car.
You can walk back.

1121
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:58,276
Edgar, we have lunch. We don't miss
lunch, no matter what, remember?

1122
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:00,278
You pulled away
from me in there.

1123
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:03,781
You perjured yourself, Edgar, and
the lie was an easily provable one.

1124
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:05,950
There's no telling how much
worse it could've been.

1125
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:07,596
Find Agent Purvis.

1126
01:10:07,597 --> 01:10:09,996
He is to be demoted immediately
or, better yet, fired.

1127
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:12,832
Firing the man who killed John
Dillinger would be a PR disaster.

1128
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,251
Then he is to spend the rest
of his career behind a desk.

1129
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:19,339
And if he'd like to keep that job,
he'd best stay out of the papers. Go.

1130
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:32,060
I don't know
who I can trust anymore.

1131
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:34,979
Only you.

1132
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:38,942
Only you, Mother.

1133
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:43,154
You're all I have to keep me safe,
you understand that?

1134
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:46,407
Please, Mother,
let me take you to a doctor.

1135
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:49,619
A simple examination
isn't unholy, is it?

1136
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:52,538
Mother.

1137
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:55,959
Mother, please.

1138
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:01,172
Faith, Edgar.

1139
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,258
Faith.

1140
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:07,637
Don't wilt like a little flower.

1141
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:09,722
Be strong.

1142
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,267
Yes, Mother.

1143
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:19,607
I will.

1144
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:28,157
If what Congress valued more
than wits and brains was muscle...

1145
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:31,411
... if what they hungered for
was an armed American hero...

1146
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:35,373
... then I was willing to risk my
very life and give them both.

1147
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,508
Move!

1148
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:38,167
Go.

1149
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:39,627
Hold it, government agents!

1150
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:56,686
The arrest is mine to make!

1151
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:58,396
Move!

1152
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:01,024
Mr. Karpis,
you are under arrest.

1153
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:06,029
Mr. Hoover himself.
I'm gonna be famous.

1154
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:08,698
Put the handcuffs on him.

1155
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,705
Don't move, Mr. Mahan.

1156
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:18,166
Blow it down.

1157
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:22,920
Move.

1158
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:37,101
Mr. Brunette,
you are under arrest.

1159
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:39,964
Alvin Karpis said he
couldn't be taken alive...

1160
01:12:39,965 --> 01:12:41,564
... but we took him
without firing a shot.

1161
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:45,568
And let me tell you, he shook all over.
His voice, his hands, and his knees.

1162
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:48,780
You arrested Harry Campbell in
Toledo and Brunette in Manhattan?

1163
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:50,448
And William Mahan
in California.

1164
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:53,159
But let me clarify without
a shadow of a doubt...

1165
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:56,312
... this was a "we" job,
not an "I" job.

1166
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:05,463
Edgar, look at this.
We made the Post Toasties box.

1167
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:09,801
"Melvin Purvis, the FBI
agent that caught Dillinger."

1168
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:12,303
Write the cereal-maker.
Let them know...

1169
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,640
Oh. "Junior G-Man."
Hmm.

1170
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:19,000
Tell them they ought to print
any further boxes to read...

1171
01:13:19,001 --> 01:13:20,978
... "former agent of the FBI."

1172
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,564
Sit down, Clyde.
I'm gonna read you something.

1173
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:29,779
"Only eight more days."

1174
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:32,990
"Funny how even the dearest face
will fade away in time."

1175
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:34,867
"Most clearly,
I remember your eyes...

1176
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:39,247
... with a sort of teasing smile in them,
and the feeling of that soft spot...

1177
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:43,000
... just northeast of the corner
of your mouth against my lips."

1178
01:13:43,168 --> 01:13:44,585
What is it?

1179
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:46,379
It's a letter from
Lorena Hickok...

1180
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:50,633
... the White House reporter with
the bad breath, to Mrs. Roosevelt.

1181
01:13:51,301 --> 01:13:54,178
No.
What are you gonna do with it?

1182
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:56,931
Nothing. I accused her
of having an affair with a man...

1183
01:13:57,099 --> 01:14:00,217
... and Old Horse Face is having
an affair with Mrs. Bat Breath!

1184
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:03,771
- A woman! Can you believe it?
- Mm.

1185
01:14:08,193 --> 01:14:11,362
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Hoover. They'd
like to see you in the laboratory.

1186
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:14,882
Yes, Miss Gandy. You tell them that
I'll be there in one minute. Thank you.

1187
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:16,200
We'll get to this later.

1188
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:21,497
Speaking of horses, Clyde,
I'm going to Del Mar this weekend.

1189
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:24,333
I was thinking of taking
a quick vacation...

1190
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:27,670
... and, well, I thought
you'd like to join me.

1191
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:30,047
Well, I've never been
to the horse races, Edgar.

1192
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:31,299
Well, it's wonderful.

1193
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:36,721
And between me and you, when I lose,
the track, they actually cover the losses.

1194
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:40,558
- So, what happens if you win?
- They still pay.

1195
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:41,809
Then where is the thrill?

1196
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:45,855
In the sun that falls on the stands,
the hotel rooms, the service...

1197
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:49,400
... the restaurants, but, most of all,
Clyde, it's the company.

1198
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:53,154
- Come with me.
- I'd love to.

1199
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:56,491
Fantastic. I'll have Miss Gandy
make all the arrangements.

1200
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,211
Well, Edgar, I can't go now.

1201
01:14:58,212 --> 01:15:00,000
But maybe in a couple months
after I've saved up.

1202
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:03,414
- It's completely covered, Clyde.
- Edgar, I can't let you do that.

1203
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:07,835
Listen, you've done so much for me,
for this Bureau. Consider it a thank you.

1204
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:10,171
I don't know that
I'd feel comfortable.

1205
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,217
Tell you what, Clyde.
I'll get a suite with adjoining rooms...

1206
01:15:14,384 --> 01:15:17,887
... rather than having us stay separate.
That'll be savings enough.

1207
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,388
Deal.

1208
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,933
What do you have
for me, Mr. Koehler?

1209
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:25,436
Well, as you can see, ahem, there
are several kinds of wood here.

1210
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:29,941
Pine, birch, fir, and, if you
look closely, you will see...

1211
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:31,275
- Thank you.
- Mr. Tolson.

1212
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:35,112
That each has its own internal
markings, rings and knots...

1213
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,516
...and its own external markings
as in here...

1214
01:15:37,517 --> 01:15:39,116
... from the machinery used
to mill the raw timber...

1215
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:42,703
... and these that mark the tools
used to build the ladder.

1216
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:46,958
The question is, how does this help us
identify the kidnappers, Mr. Koehler?

1217
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:48,751
I need more money, sir.

1218
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:51,420
- More money, sir, for what?
- Postage.

1219
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:54,090
I need to write every mill
on the East Coast...

1220
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:57,635
... and see if their blades
match these marks.

1221
01:15:57,803 --> 01:15:59,178
Hmm.

1222
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:02,807
I want a report from each mill
and a map tracking all leads.

1223
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:06,310
By the time I get back from New
York, I want something to report.

1224
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:07,645
Good day.

1225
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:18,823
Just like the communist
radicals before them...

1226
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:20,491
... the gangster fell from favor.

1227
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:24,829
Now finally, children dreamed
of joining the FBI.

1228
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:35,590
On your feet.
On your feet.

1229
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:40,970
Yeah?

1230
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:43,931
He's taking his shower.
Any message?

1231
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:46,517
There ain't any shower
there, copper.

1232
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:00,865
Miss Temple!

1233
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:04,744
Mr. Hoover, I was wondering
if you would join my police force.

1234
01:17:04,911 --> 01:17:06,287
Why, yes, Miss Temple.

1235
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:10,666
If you agree to be an honorary
G-Woman, and give me one little kiss.

1236
01:17:11,501 --> 01:17:14,045
I don't know if your wife
would approve, Mr. Hoover.

1237
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,798
But, you see, Miss Temple,
I still live with my mother.

1238
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:21,469
Oh.
Okay.

1239
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,888
- Look this way!
- That's real spiffy, one more!

1240
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:26,015
Nice smile.
Thank you very much.

1241
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,228
Excuse me, sir.
Can we get a statement?

1242
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:32,980
How'd you like the picture?

1243
01:17:35,025 --> 01:17:36,233
This way, Mr. Hoover!

1244
01:17:36,401 --> 01:17:37,777
After you, Mother.

1245
01:17:50,415 --> 01:17:52,249
Should we go to the club?

1246
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:55,670
After we drop Mother
off at the hotel.

1247
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:18,150
I have you at a table
with Anita Colby.

1248
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:22,363
Lela Rogers and her daughter
Ginger have asked if they can join.

1249
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:24,073
As long as it's near the front.

1250
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:27,284
Miss Rogers, pleasure to meet you.
This must be your mother.

1251
01:18:27,452 --> 01:18:28,452
Hello.

1252
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:31,580
J. Edgar Hoover. This is Clyde Tolson.
Anita, good to see you.

1253
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:42,133
The bullet entered
the back of the head...

1254
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,760
... and exited through
the front near his cheek.

1255
01:18:44,928 --> 01:18:48,305
The thing that most people don't
realize is that there is very little blood.

1256
01:18:48,473 --> 01:18:52,143
The heat from the bullet actually
seals the wound as it enters...

1257
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:55,306
... so the crime scene is far
more peaceful than is depicted...

1258
01:18:55,307 --> 01:18:57,106
... in your moving pictures.

1259
01:18:57,274 --> 01:19:00,651
And little Lindy. Did you see
the child with your own eyes?

1260
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:03,529
Those are details I wouldn't
care to disclose...

1261
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:06,365
... with a refined group of women
such as yourselves.

1262
01:19:06,533 --> 01:19:08,413
I couldn't bear to make a single
one of you shed a tear.

1263
01:19:08,414 --> 01:19:12,413
But I assure you this,
we are on the case.

1264
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,666
I saw the Lindberghs in Paris.
I hardly recognized them.

1265
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:16,834
Hmm.

1266
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:20,171
Only justice can bring reason
back to their lives.

1267
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:25,134
But I might share one confidential
clue with you, if you swear to secrecy.

1268
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:27,845
Of course.

1269
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:30,639
The first gold notes from
the ransom money have surfaced.

1270
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,349
And can you guess where?

1271
01:19:32,517 --> 01:19:34,018
Tell us.
Please, Mr. Hoover.

1272
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:36,395
In the Bronx,
on three occasions.

1273
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:38,439
And each one of
the shop owners claim...

1274
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:42,860
... they received them from a man with
a pointed chin and a German accent.

1275
01:19:45,363 --> 01:19:48,199
Take my word for it,
Mr. Hoover.

1276
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:51,202
All the admiration in the world
can't fill the spot where love goes.

1277
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:52,411
Hmm.

1278
01:19:52,579 --> 01:19:54,205
Or keep your bed warm.

1279
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:58,584
I serve my country, Miss Colby.

1280
01:19:58,752 --> 01:20:01,796
The nation's admiration
is more than enough for me.

1281
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,216
But it likely makes
for a cold bed.

1282
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:09,000
Mr. Hoover, would it be out
of the question for me...

1283
01:20:09,001 --> 01:20:10,179
... to bother you for a dance?

1284
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:12,223
Oh, uh... how do you mean?

1285
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:15,309
Well, simply a dance.

1286
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:17,311
You do dance, don't you?

1287
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:20,981
Well, that is a skill that um...
I haven't yet mastered.

1288
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:24,318
And the night is getting long,
isn't it, Mr. Tolson? Mr. Tolson?

1289
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:27,196
There's no time like the present.
It's my favorite song, come on.

1290
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:29,865
Mr. Tolson, it's time we leave.
Uh... we have a great deal of work.

1291
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:32,243
We... we... we have a great
deal of work tomorrow...

1292
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:36,163
... and I'm afraid we don't have time
to dance. We're very busy, aren't we?

1293
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:37,623
Yes.

1294
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:40,084
And my sincere apologies.
I...

1295
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:42,211
Right now, Mr. Tolson.
Thank you very much.

1296
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:43,838
- Good evening.
- Ha, ha.

1297
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:45,256
Good night.

1298
01:20:49,302 --> 01:20:50,511
I don't...

1299
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:52,304
I...

1300
01:20:52,472 --> 01:20:55,266
I don't... I don't like to...
I don't like to dance, Mother.

1301
01:20:55,433 --> 01:20:58,394
- I don't like to da...
- Edgar, go look in the mirror.

1302
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:01,689
Talk the way the doctor taught
you to. Be my little Speedy.

1303
01:21:12,784 --> 01:21:14,952
I can spit my words
out with... with...

1304
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:19,790
I can spit my words out with
precision, diction, and clarity.

1305
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:24,461
I can sp... spit my words out
with precision, diction, and clarity.

1306
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:32,386
I'm a proficient, remarkable lad,
capable of remarkable noble feats.

1307
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:35,472
I'm a profic... Mother.
Mother, I don't like to dance.

1308
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:39,493
I don't like to dance with anyone but
mostly I don't like to dance with women.

1309
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,520
I think it's time you knew this.

1310
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:44,315
And I find it humiliating and
I refuse to be publicly humiliated.

1311
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:46,650
Edgar, stop.

1312
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:49,486
Do you remember
Barton Pincus?

1313
01:21:51,197 --> 01:21:52,781
Yes, Mother.

1314
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:54,992
His father was a watchmaker.

1315
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:58,871
He was 10 years younger than me
and you used to call him...

1316
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:03,834
... Birdy or Daffy
or something to that effect.

1317
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:06,503
And do you remember
what happened to Daffy?

1318
01:22:06,671 --> 01:22:10,841
After the school custodian discovered
him in a hoop skirt and flower bonnet?

1319
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:15,512
He was made to stand outside
in front of the school...

1320
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:18,849
... wearing the bonnet
and skirt as punishment.

1321
01:22:19,559 --> 01:22:22,019
Did you ever wonder why
we called him Daffy?

1322
01:22:23,229 --> 01:22:26,857
For his odd behavior, I believe.

1323
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:30,736
It's short for "daffodil," Edgar.

1324
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:35,290
Do you remember what happened
to little Daffodil Pincus?

1325
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:38,035
Yes, Mother.
He...

1326
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:41,080
He shot himself six weeks after.

1327
01:22:41,247 --> 01:22:42,289
That's right.

1328
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:47,211
And I thank God every day that my own
sons don't suffer from his condition.

1329
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:49,463
Edgar.

1330
01:22:51,424 --> 01:22:54,551
I'd rather have a dead son
than a daffodil for a son.

1331
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:02,726
And now,
I'm gonna teach you to dance.

1332
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:08,148
Yes, Mother.

1333
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:45,436
- Bring this right over here, please.
- Sure, sir.

1334
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:49,773
All right. Now, when did
you get this shipment?

1335
01:23:50,483 --> 01:23:54,778
It's a long while back.
I'm thinking, uh... November 1931.

1336
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:57,823
Three months
before the kidnapping.

1337
01:23:59,325 --> 01:24:00,701
All right.
Thank you.

1338
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:04,671
If the lumberyard is a cash business,
then there aren't any receipts or names.

1339
01:24:04,689 --> 01:24:05,916
It tells us where he was shopping...

1340
01:24:05,917 --> 01:24:07,576
... before he knew
we were looking for him.

1341
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:10,461
Show me the addresses of where
the ransom bills have shown up.

1342
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:13,047
It's 456 West Third.

1343
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:16,008
And 476 West Third.

1344
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:18,802
And down the street right here.

1345
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:24,641
We knew who we were looking for.

1346
01:24:24,809 --> 01:24:27,978
Someone who'd done business
in this neighborhood for years.

1347
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:29,438
Someone who was still there.

1348
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:31,732
He was average height,
blue eyes.

1349
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,817
High cheekbones
and a pointy chin.

1350
01:24:33,985 --> 01:24:38,155
Yes, sir, a pointed chin
and an accent, like a...

1351
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:39,990
German accent, maybe?

1352
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:42,826
A German with big cheekbones.

1353
01:24:43,661 --> 01:24:46,288
Am I, uh... going to get him
in some kind of trouble?

1354
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:47,834
Not if he didn't do anything wrong.

1355
01:24:47,856 --> 01:24:50,834
We're the FBI, son.
We're the good guys.

1356
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:54,838
It was deposited by Walter Lyle.

1357
01:24:55,006 --> 01:24:59,176
He manages the gas station
up on Lexington and 127th.

1358
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:00,969
Walter Lyle?

1359
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:03,138
You remember the man
that paid with this?

1360
01:25:03,306 --> 01:25:05,896
Yes, I remember him.
He bought 89 cents worth of gas.

1361
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:08,685
And he paid with this bill?

1362
01:25:08,853 --> 01:25:11,772
Yes, sir. But I don't know him.
I haven't seen him since.

1363
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:15,025
You would remember him
if he came in again?

1364
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:16,529
Yeah, he was German, I think.

1365
01:25:16,530 --> 01:25:18,529
I mean, with an accent
and pointed chin.

1366
01:25:18,696 --> 01:25:19,825
High cheekbones, right?

1367
01:25:19,826 --> 01:25:21,525
Yeah, I guess I looked
at the bill funny...

1368
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:24,034
... 'cause he assured me he had
a hundred more just like it at home.

1369
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:25,661
You had a conversation with him?

1370
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:27,663
No, that was it.

1371
01:25:28,581 --> 01:25:29,623
Thank you, Mr. Lyle.

1372
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,501
I wrote down
the license plate number.

1373
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:35,587
That's the writing right there
along the edge of the bill.

1374
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:39,216
Let's go.

1375
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:48,100
Miss Gandy, get Mr. Tolson.

1376
01:25:57,068 --> 01:25:58,235
Agent Sisk.

1377
01:25:58,403 --> 01:26:00,214
The New York Motor Vehicles
Bureau describes it...

1378
01:26:00,215 --> 01:26:02,114
... as a light blue
1930 Dodge sedan.

1379
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:04,241
The owner is a carpenter
born in Germany...

1380
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:08,745
... lives at 1279 East 222nd Street
in the Bronx.

1381
01:26:08,913 --> 01:26:10,581
His name is
Bruno Richard Hauptmann.

1382
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:23,218
Let's move.

1383
01:26:23,386 --> 01:26:25,596
On September 19th,
1934...

1384
01:26:25,763 --> 01:26:28,599
... before we could arrest
the most wanted man in America...

1385
01:26:28,766 --> 01:26:33,020
... he'd been pulled over by
a local cop for a broken tail light.

1386
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:34,438
Can't believe this.

1387
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,025
Pull over.

1388
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:47,868
FBI, put your hands up!

1389
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:49,912
- Put them up!
- Is there a problem?

1390
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:52,456
Get out of the car!

1391
01:27:02,508 --> 01:27:04,850
Bruno Hauptmann,
you are under arrest...

1392
01:27:04,851 --> 01:27:07,638
... for the kidnapping and
murder of Charles Lindbergh Jr.

1393
01:27:07,805 --> 01:27:09,932
Cuff him, boys.

1394
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:17,314
We finally had him.

1395
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:20,651
Now we had to convict,
but unlike trials of the past...

1396
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:26,114
... we now had forensics,
expert witnesses, and facts.

1397
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:32,878
We need a title,
Agent Garrison.

1398
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:34,331
Right away, Mr. Hoover.

1399
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:38,168
We are working, Miss Gandy.

1400
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:39,878
The tape came in.

1401
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:42,756
Bring it to my private office.

1402
01:27:43,841 --> 01:27:45,842
That'll be all for now,
Agent Garrison.

1403
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,988
I just have to say...

1404
01:28:06,155 --> 01:28:09,574
... you looked so beautiful
sitting across that bar.

1405
01:28:09,742 --> 01:28:11,535
I saw you watching me.

1406
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:13,578
I have to admit
I was watching you...

1407
01:28:13,746 --> 01:28:15,122
... for a long time.

1408
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:20,961
Slow down a little bit.

1409
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,170
All right.

1410
01:28:24,424 --> 01:28:26,049
Let me take this off.

1411
01:28:26,676 --> 01:28:28,051
Turn around.

1412
01:28:30,722 --> 01:28:31,972
You got it?

1413
01:28:54,203 --> 01:28:56,580
Miss Gandy, I told you
I'm not to be disturbed.

1414
01:28:56,748 --> 01:28:58,373
I'm sorry.
Mr. Hoover?

1415
01:28:58,541 --> 01:29:02,169
Yes, it's urgent. I have Agent
Shanklin on the line from Dallas.

1416
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:03,920
My apologies, Mr. Hoover.

1417
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:05,630
I told Miss Gandy
to put me right through.

1418
01:29:05,798 --> 01:29:08,091
What is it, Agent Shanklin?

1419
01:29:08,551 --> 01:29:11,636
Sir, the president has been shot.

1420
01:29:13,639 --> 01:29:15,015
Who else knows about this?

1421
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:18,643
No one, sir. I thought you should
know before the press reports it.

1422
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:22,064
- Thank you, Agent Shanklin.
- Yes, sir.

1423
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:31,948
Oh, that feels so good.

1424
01:29:58,059 --> 01:30:00,644
Get me Robert Kennedy
immediately.

1425
01:30:07,193 --> 01:30:08,485
Mr. Hoover?

1426
01:30:09,112 --> 01:30:12,739
Mr. Kennedy,
the president has been shot.

1427
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,242
What?

1428
01:30:15,785 --> 01:30:17,828
Mr. Hoover?
What?

1429
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:21,832
Mr. Hoover?

1430
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:34,886
It's Frosty Mountain in front...

1431
01:30:35,054 --> 01:30:36,138
... by a length and a half.

1432
01:30:36,305 --> 01:30:38,682
That's Jazz third by six.

1433
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:43,395
Slapjack's fourth, final head.
Popstar Morell three quarters.

1434
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:47,058
Turning for home, Frosty Mountain
under the left by a fraction...

1435
01:30:47,059 --> 01:30:48,358
... and a length and a half.

1436
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:51,570
Number five.
He's gaining on them.

1437
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:54,656
It's Frosty Mountain, now.

1438
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:58,368
I'm not sure if I bet on that one.

1439
01:30:58,536 --> 01:31:01,705
Ah.
We lost again, Clyde.

1440
01:31:01,914 --> 01:31:04,332
Dextro back by
a half-length on the rail.

1441
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:07,586
Dextro now making his move.
Findlay gives him the whip.

1442
01:31:07,753 --> 01:31:09,504
Oh, there he goes,
there he goes!

1443
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:11,548
Come on, Dextro,
come on, Dextro!

1444
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:58,845
- Did you see his shoes?
- Ha, ha.

1445
01:31:59,138 --> 01:32:00,222
Desi Arnaz?

1446
01:32:00,389 --> 01:32:03,892
You mean the crocodile ones with
the horrible buckles across the top?

1447
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,602
No, I didn't notice them one bit.

1448
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:08,438
You'd think with all their money,
they'd have a little bit of fashion sense.

1449
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:10,857
- Ha, ha.
- Or at least pay someone to have it.

1450
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:12,609
Oh, and his faux-ginger wife.

1451
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:17,664
When she walked in, I thought a hunter
was gonna pull a rifle on that hat of hers.

1452
01:32:18,741 --> 01:32:20,575
It was like this, you see, like...

1453
01:32:20,743 --> 01:32:22,786
Ha-ha-ha.
That's right, with the feathers.

1454
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:29,543
You know, I care so very much
for you, Clyde. I do.

1455
01:32:31,837 --> 01:32:34,214
And I love you, Edgar.

1456
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:43,723
Is everything okay?

1457
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:45,141
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

1458
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:47,060
I'm fine.

1459
01:32:50,481 --> 01:32:53,817
I've been meaning
to ask you something, Clyde.

1460
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:54,985
Anything.

1461
01:32:57,321 --> 01:33:01,274
What do you think of
Dorothy Lamour, the actress?

1462
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:03,285
With Rudy Vallee
at the Stork Club?

1463
01:33:03,452 --> 01:33:05,328
Yes.
That's the one.

1464
01:33:05,496 --> 01:33:08,623
She's a little camp for me,
but, heh...

1465
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:14,963
Well, I've been thinking of
taking her up on a proposal is all.

1466
01:33:16,173 --> 01:33:17,173
For dinner?

1467
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,634
No, no, not dinner.

1468
01:33:20,678 --> 01:33:22,554
We've been to dinner
several times now.

1469
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:25,056
When?

1470
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:29,603
Oh, in New York, when I've
gone up on the weekends.

1471
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:33,607
I see.

1472
01:33:36,068 --> 01:33:40,655
I suppose what I'm... what I'm trying
to say here, Clyde, is, well...

1473
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:45,910
... I think it may be time
for a Mrs. Hoover.

1474
01:33:53,669 --> 01:33:56,338
What, you don't like her?
Is that it?

1475
01:33:57,715 --> 01:33:59,841
Don't you make
a fool of me, Edgar.

1476
01:34:00,009 --> 01:34:03,011
I'm not, Clyde,
I'm not making a fool of you.

1477
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:08,016
Have you... have you
become physical?

1478
01:34:10,811 --> 01:34:12,020
Yes, we have.

1479
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:14,314
What is it, Clyde?

1480
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:16,969
Do you want me
to be half a person?

1481
01:34:16,970 --> 01:34:19,069
Or remain incomplete,
is that what you want?

1482
01:34:20,529 --> 01:34:22,739
Is that what I am to you,
incompletion?

1483
01:34:23,282 --> 01:34:25,075
Clyde, pick that glass
up immediately!

1484
01:34:25,242 --> 01:34:27,827
No, I will not!
I have no reason to!

1485
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:30,747
I refuse!
So, go on, fire me.

1486
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:32,207
Do it.
Now!

1487
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:35,018
Clyde, get a hold of yourself.
You're acting like a fool!

1488
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:36,920
- Agh!
- Stop this!

1489
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:39,589
Clyde! You have no shoes on,
for God's sakes!

1490
01:34:39,757 --> 01:34:42,425
No. No, I will not!
I won't even listen to you!

1491
01:34:42,593 --> 01:34:45,428
You will never tell me what to do!
You just lost that right!

1492
01:34:45,596 --> 01:34:47,347
- Stop it!
- I see right through you!

1493
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:50,767
You're a scared, heartless,
horrible little man!

1494
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:52,435
- Unh! Don't you dare!
- Unh!

1495
01:35:30,516 --> 01:35:32,434
Don't you ever do that again.

1496
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:35,186
I won't.

1497
01:35:37,648 --> 01:35:39,315
Clyde.

1498
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:42,694
Clyde, where are you going?

1499
01:35:43,112 --> 01:35:46,573
Clyde, please.
Clyde, don't leave me!

1500
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:47,907
Clyde, please.

1501
01:35:48,075 --> 01:35:49,826
Clyde, I'm sorry!

1502
01:35:49,994 --> 01:35:51,828
Clyde, please don't leave me!

1503
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:53,163
Clyde, I'm begging you!

1504
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:57,834
I'm begging you, Clyde!
Clyde, please.

1505
01:35:58,002 --> 01:36:00,211
After all...

1506
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:09,637
After all, we have
another day of races.

1507
01:36:17,104 --> 01:36:20,607
If you ever mention
a lady friend again...

1508
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:23,777
... it will be the last time
that you share my company.

1509
01:36:35,956 --> 01:36:37,624
Love you, Clyde.

1510
01:36:39,668 --> 01:36:40,835
Love you.

1511
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:47,717
Mr. Meter looks promising.

1512
01:37:02,566 --> 01:37:04,901
- Unh. Ugh.
- What is it, Clyde?

1513
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:06,611
Clyde?

1514
01:37:06,779 --> 01:37:08,154
Someone get a doctor.

1515
01:37:08,322 --> 01:37:09,489
Clyde.

1516
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:13,576
Someone get a doctor now!
Someone get a doctor!

1517
01:37:13,744 --> 01:37:16,079
Clyde, look at me.
Look at me.

1518
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:19,415
Someone get a doctor now!

1519
01:37:19,583 --> 01:37:21,084
Help!

1520
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:23,086
He'll be able to recover
most of his function...

1521
01:37:23,254 --> 01:37:26,256
... but a stroke like this,
it will limit the hours he can work...

1522
01:37:26,423 --> 01:37:28,007
... the information
he can process.

1523
01:37:28,175 --> 01:37:29,884
Are you okay, Mr. Hoover?

1524
01:37:30,594 --> 01:37:34,097
Yes, I'm fine. I just... I was playing
with my dog in the yard on Saturday.

1525
01:37:34,265 --> 01:37:36,266
Perhaps it's dehydration.

1526
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:40,228
That could do it, but it may be wise
to reduce your work hours as well.

1527
01:37:40,396 --> 01:37:42,564
At your age,
it's important to take leave.

1528
01:37:43,482 --> 01:37:46,484
Miss Gandy, please,
give us some privacy.

1529
01:37:51,782 --> 01:37:55,159
Let me tell you, if you ever denigrate
me in front of my staff like that again...

1530
01:37:55,369 --> 01:37:58,488
... I'll have you railroaded out of
your profession, do you understand?

1531
01:37:59,456 --> 01:38:00,623
I apologize, sir.

1532
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:02,876
Tell me something.

1533
01:38:03,294 --> 01:38:05,128
What do you have for energy?

1534
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:08,631
We have diet medications
which tend to give a boost.

1535
01:38:08,799 --> 01:38:12,302
So I could lose a few pounds
and have more energy as well?

1536
01:38:12,469 --> 01:38:15,305
Wouldn't worry about your
weight, sir. It's solid weight.

1537
01:38:15,514 --> 01:38:16,931
Hmm.

1538
01:38:17,474 --> 01:38:18,975
Schedule a daily visit.

1539
01:38:20,519 --> 01:38:21,686
Yes, sir.

1540
01:38:30,487 --> 01:38:34,157
They're giving King the Nobel Prize.
Can you believe it?

1541
01:38:34,325 --> 01:38:37,327
The degenerates and radicals
are being lifted up internationally.

1542
01:38:37,494 --> 01:38:40,663
It's like it's 1920 all over again.

1543
01:38:40,998 --> 01:38:42,165
Don't.

1544
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,627
When he finds out
that we have this audiotape...

1545
01:38:45,794 --> 01:38:48,004
... that we know the truth
about his character...

1546
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:51,507
... he's going to decline
the award, Clyde, believe me.

1547
01:38:51,967 --> 01:38:54,052
President Johnson...

1548
01:38:54,219 --> 01:38:55,261
Wait.

1549
01:38:55,846 --> 01:38:57,013
- Clyde.
- Wait.

1550
01:38:57,181 --> 01:38:59,300
You're gonna have
to learn to enunciate.

1551
01:38:59,301 --> 01:39:01,100
I can't seem to understand you.

1552
01:39:01,268 --> 01:39:05,229
Now, the problem is this,
we have no legal tools.

1553
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:08,024
You see, our laws
have not kept pace...

1554
01:39:08,192 --> 01:39:10,860
... with the improved tactics
of today's criminals.

1555
01:39:11,028 --> 01:39:12,820
I'm gonna do this for you.

1556
01:39:13,072 --> 01:39:15,365
What's your idea?

1557
01:39:15,532 --> 01:39:18,201
Well, we have friends
in the press, right?

1558
01:39:18,369 --> 01:39:21,245
We plant stories
with them to ensure...

1559
01:39:21,455 --> 01:39:25,333
... that the activities of suspected
radicals see the light of day.

1560
01:39:26,001 --> 01:39:27,877
They'll trace it.

1561
01:39:28,504 --> 01:39:30,213
Well, only if it's true.

1562
01:39:31,006 --> 01:39:33,007
See, it's called counterintelligence,
Clyde.

1563
01:39:33,175 --> 01:39:36,511
The more untrue the story,
the more dramatic the impact.

1564
01:39:36,679 --> 01:39:39,681
Now, I'm going to send
the hotel recording...

1565
01:39:39,848 --> 01:39:44,227
... along with a personal letter the
day before he gets the Nobel Prize.

1566
01:39:44,395 --> 01:39:48,398
And if he accepts the award, we'll
send the tape straight to the press.

1567
01:39:50,025 --> 01:39:54,904
Are you sure that you want to be
involved with that kind of surveillance?

1568
01:39:55,072 --> 01:39:57,615
Well, that's why the letter
won't be from me.

1569
01:39:57,783 --> 01:40:00,243
It'll be a fictitious letter
from one of his own.

1570
01:40:01,745 --> 01:40:07,333
Then there can be no room for error.
I'm not sure that we could ensu...

1571
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:11,087
I cannot understand what
you're saying, Clyde. Please.

1572
01:40:11,255 --> 01:40:14,382
Come on now.
Learn to speak up.

1573
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:21,198
Now, listen, I'm gonna need
you in the office tomorrow.

1574
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:22,598
No time to relent.

1575
01:40:25,227 --> 01:40:26,769
I can't.

1576
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:29,063
Yes, you can.

1577
01:40:29,815 --> 01:40:31,107
Now eat.

1578
01:40:32,609 --> 01:40:36,654
You'd think after all this time she'd
be able to cook my egg correctly.

1579
01:40:38,115 --> 01:40:40,283
What exactly are in these shots?

1580
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:41,701
Oh, it's just vitamins...

1581
01:40:41,869 --> 01:40:43,619
... a little extra pick-me-up.

1582
01:40:56,341 --> 01:40:57,759
"Look into your heart."

1583
01:40:57,926 --> 01:41:02,764
"You know you are a complete fraud
and a great liability to all of us Negroes."

1584
01:41:02,931 --> 01:41:06,309
I said "us," Miss Gandy,
"us," not "the."

1585
01:41:06,810 --> 01:41:08,269
You're a Negro now, sir?

1586
01:41:08,437 --> 01:41:11,314
Write every word as I say it,
is that understood?

1587
01:41:11,482 --> 01:41:14,984
Now, "White people in this country
have enough frauds of their own...

1588
01:41:15,152 --> 01:41:17,153
... but I am sure they do not
have one at this time...

1589
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:19,238
... that is anywhere
near your equal."

1590
01:41:19,406 --> 01:41:22,325
- "I repeat..."
- Sir, what is this exercise?

1591
01:41:22,493 --> 01:41:26,662
Miss Gandy, I am not going to entertain
questions during my dictation, now write.

1592
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:32,752
"I repeat, you are a colossal fraud
and an evil, vicious one, at that!"

1593
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:33,956
"You do not believe in God."

1594
01:41:33,957 --> 01:41:36,756
"Clearly, you do not believe in
any personal moral principles!"

1595
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:39,217
Sir, may I ask who this letter
will be addressed to...

1596
01:41:39,384 --> 01:41:41,928
The question is not to whom,
Miss Gandy, not to whom...

1597
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:45,348
... but from whom and it is not from
this office, is that understood?

1598
01:41:45,516 --> 01:41:47,767
"You have turned out
to be not a leader...

1599
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:51,437
... but a dissolute, abnormal,
moral imbecile."

1600
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:54,357
"There is only one thing left to do
and you know what that is."

1601
01:41:54,525 --> 01:41:57,026
"There is but one way out,
and you better take it...

1602
01:41:57,194 --> 01:42:02,281
... before your filthy, abnormal,
fraudulent self is bared to this nation."

1603
01:42:02,449 --> 01:42:04,033
Did you get everything,
Miss Gandy?

1604
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:07,203
- Edgar.
- Type it up.

1605
01:42:08,247 --> 01:42:09,789
Type it up.

1606
01:42:15,212 --> 01:42:18,381
I understand that you work for our
PR department, is that correct?

1607
01:42:19,049 --> 01:42:20,716
For two years now, sir.

1608
01:42:20,926 --> 01:42:24,095
Then you are familiar
with my earlier work...

1609
01:42:24,263 --> 01:42:27,723
... against Edward Clarke and
his Ku Klux Klan, are you not?

1610
01:42:27,891 --> 01:42:29,058
Yes, sir.

1611
01:42:29,226 --> 01:42:32,228
He was arrested for a violation
of the white slave traffic act...

1612
01:42:32,396 --> 01:42:35,773
... for crossing state lines to have an
extramarital affair with a white woman.

1613
01:42:35,941 --> 01:42:36,983
Is that correct, sir?

1614
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:41,237
That is correct. It was the strongest
law at my disposal at the time.

1615
01:42:41,405 --> 01:42:45,408
I'll have you know that
I'm very proud of that work.

1616
01:42:45,576 --> 01:42:48,953
Miss Gandy told me that you stopped
with Bruno Hauptmann's arrest.

1617
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:52,415
- Would you like to start there?
- Yes, yes, I think we shall.

1618
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:58,212
Mr. Hauptmann
was brought to trial...

1619
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:00,715
... on January 2nd, 1935.

1620
01:43:01,925 --> 01:43:06,262
H.L. Mencken called this the
biggest story since the resurrection.

1621
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:10,057
From the looks of things,
this may be bigger.

1622
01:43:10,225 --> 01:43:12,643
Well, you see, no two saws
make the same markings.

1623
01:43:12,811 --> 01:43:16,439
This saw from Bruno Hauptmann's
tool chest makes markings identical...

1624
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:19,400
... to those found on the ladder
used in the crime.

1625
01:43:19,568 --> 01:43:22,086
In both the ransom note
and Mr. Hauptmann's writings...

1626
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:27,867
... he wrote the word "anyding"
for "anything", uh... "gut" for "good"...

1627
01:43:28,035 --> 01:43:32,538
..."boad" for "boat,"
and notice the inverted capital N's.

1628
01:43:32,706 --> 01:43:35,708
And the Y's that look like J's.

1629
01:43:35,876 --> 01:43:37,960
Mr. Lindbergh,
you said you heard a voice...

1630
01:43:38,128 --> 01:43:39,462
... in the cemetery that night.

1631
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:41,881
Yes, very clearly.

1632
01:43:42,049 --> 01:43:44,634
A voice coming from the cemetery,
to the best of my belief...

1633
01:43:44,801 --> 01:43:48,471
... calling Dr. Condon
in a foreign accent.

1634
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:49,639
"Hey, doctor."

1635
01:43:49,806 --> 01:43:50,848
Since that time...

1636
01:43:51,016 --> 01:43:52,808
... have you heard
the same voice?

1637
01:43:52,976 --> 01:43:54,477
Yes, I have.

1638
01:43:54,645 --> 01:43:57,647
Whose voice was it that you
heard in the cemetery that night...

1639
01:43:57,814 --> 01:43:59,649
... saying, "Hey, doctor"?

1640
01:43:59,816 --> 01:44:01,651
That was Hauptmann's voice.

1641
01:44:04,154 --> 01:44:05,947
But did he act alone?

1642
01:44:07,282 --> 01:44:11,202
He never confessed,
but what sociopath ever does?

1643
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:13,120
The evidence was clear.

1644
01:44:13,288 --> 01:44:16,142
He was indicted for murder
in the first degree...

1645
01:44:16,143 --> 01:44:18,542
... while perpetrating a burglary.

1646
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:22,004
In New Jersey,
that is punishable by death.

1647
01:44:22,172 --> 01:44:23,381
Mr. Hauptmann...

1648
01:44:23,548 --> 01:44:26,008
... you've had an opportunity
in this courtroom today...

1649
01:44:26,176 --> 01:44:28,219
... to tell the whole truth.

1650
01:44:28,387 --> 01:44:29,804
Have you told the truth?

1651
01:44:29,972 --> 01:44:32,181
I told the truth already.

1652
01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:33,432
And the statements...

1653
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,018
... to District Attorney Foley.
Did you tell him the whole truth?

1654
01:44:36,979 --> 01:44:38,271
To a certain extent.

1655
01:44:38,438 --> 01:44:42,858
"To a certain extent." You didn't
tell him the truth, is that right?

1656
01:44:45,195 --> 01:44:49,949
This board that was found
in your closet, S-204...

1657
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:52,868
... has these numbers
written on it.

1658
01:44:53,036 --> 01:44:54,870
It's a little blurred now, isn't it?

1659
01:44:55,038 --> 01:44:56,330
Looks like it.

1660
01:44:56,498 --> 01:44:57,592
Between those numbers
are some words.

1661
01:44:57,593 --> 01:44:59,392
It looks like Decatur
and Sedgwick.

1662
01:44:59,459 --> 01:45:00,501
Do you see that?

1663
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:05,047
You know what that means,
don't you? That address on there?

1664
01:45:06,049 --> 01:45:07,216
Not exactly.

1665
01:45:08,593 --> 01:45:11,554
It is the address and telephone
number of Dr. Condon...

1666
01:45:11,722 --> 01:45:13,222
... the man who paid the ransom...

1667
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:17,310
... written in your writing,
found on a board in your closet.

1668
01:45:17,477 --> 01:45:20,688
Mr. Hoover,
the doctor's here to see you.

1669
01:45:20,856 --> 01:45:22,982
Following Dr. King's
historic speech...

1670
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:25,386
... many said that day brought
about a new awakening...

1671
01:45:25,387 --> 01:45:26,986
... in the conscience
of the nation.

1672
01:45:27,154 --> 01:45:29,572
Others called it
a national disgrace.

1673
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:34,410
In the long history of man's cruelty
to man, this was a day of hope.

1674
01:45:34,578 --> 01:45:35,995
I have a dream...

1675
01:45:36,997 --> 01:45:39,457
... that one day...

1676
01:45:39,624 --> 01:45:43,336
... this nation will rise up...

1677
01:45:43,503 --> 01:45:46,172
... and live out the true
meaning of its creeds.

1678
01:45:47,090 --> 01:45:51,635
A man's legacy is determined by
where the story ends, Agent Owens.

1679
01:45:51,803 --> 01:45:53,922
Let's think about that tonight
and make a decision tomorrow.

1680
01:45:53,923 --> 01:45:54,922
Shall we?

1681
01:45:55,474 --> 01:45:56,891
Is this about a man's legacy?

1682
01:45:58,435 --> 01:46:00,269
Or an institution's reputation?

1683
01:46:01,438 --> 01:46:03,272
The two are connected,
Agent Owens.

1684
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,941
One invented the other
and vice versa.

1685
01:46:06,109 --> 01:46:07,943
Good day to you.

1686
01:46:09,404 --> 01:46:10,946
Yes, sir.

1687
01:46:11,114 --> 01:46:14,492
We the jury find the defendant,
Bruno Richard Hauptmann...

1688
01:46:14,659 --> 01:46:16,535
... guilty of murder
in the first degree.

1689
01:46:27,798 --> 01:46:30,716
Your Honor, I ask
for immediate sentencing.

1690
01:46:33,804 --> 01:46:37,431
According to the law
of this state...

1691
01:46:37,599 --> 01:46:40,893
... I rule that Mr. Bruno
Hauptmann suffer death...

1692
01:46:41,061 --> 01:46:46,649
... at the time and place and
in the manner provided by law.

1693
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:56,826
It's death for Hauptmann!

1694
01:47:02,165 --> 01:47:03,499
The trial of the century...

1695
01:47:03,667 --> 01:47:08,462
... the criminal shamed, the FBI
cemented as the public hero.

1696
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:11,257
That's our,
that's our ending, agent.

1697
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:15,177
But did he do it alone?

1698
01:47:15,554 --> 01:47:17,653
Is he the one who actually
took the child from the crib?

1699
01:47:17,654 --> 01:47:18,672
How can you be sure?

1700
01:47:19,724 --> 01:47:23,644
Well, the mountain of evidence
we discovered, uncovered...

1701
01:47:23,812 --> 01:47:26,689
... confirmed, and clarified,
you cannot dispute it.

1702
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:29,616
- Clarence Darrow did.
- Of course. Heh.

1703
01:47:30,193 --> 01:47:32,194
Of course, Agent Owens.
That's what he does.

1704
01:47:32,362 --> 01:47:34,905
Mrs. Roosevelt issued a public
statement questioning his guilt.

1705
01:47:35,073 --> 01:47:37,002
Well, she has enough
to hide on her own...

1706
01:47:37,003 --> 01:47:40,202
... when it comes
to un-American activities.

1707
01:47:42,747 --> 01:47:46,375
Well, if you're comfortable with it
as an ending, I'll do my best with it.

1708
01:47:47,127 --> 01:47:50,129
Yes.
Yes, I am.

1709
01:47:50,839 --> 01:47:52,339
Sir.

1710
01:47:56,628 --> 01:47:58,053
Watch this with me.

1711
01:47:58,221 --> 01:48:01,056
He received my letter
and the audio tape last night.

1712
01:48:01,224 --> 01:48:03,225
President Johnson
affixes his signature...

1713
01:48:03,393 --> 01:48:04,477
... using more than 100 pens.

1714
01:48:04,644 --> 01:48:07,605
One of the coveted souvenirs
goes to the Nobel prize-winner...

1715
01:48:07,772 --> 01:48:10,024
... Martin Luther King,
a dedicated leader...

1716
01:48:10,192 --> 01:48:12,026
Go on, say it, Clyde.

1717
01:48:13,361 --> 01:48:17,865
It just seems so risky, Edgar,
over a couple of negative articles.

1718
01:48:18,533 --> 01:48:21,076
He's deliberately surrounded
himself with communists...

1719
01:48:21,244 --> 01:48:25,039
... and with the power he's gathering,
he's now our greatest domestic threat.

1720
01:48:25,207 --> 01:48:30,586
On behalf of
the Nobel Committee...

1721
01:48:30,754 --> 01:48:34,590
- ... we hand over to you the insignia...
- He's going to decline the award, Clyde.

1722
01:48:34,758 --> 01:48:37,259
He knows what
we have can ruin him.

1723
01:48:37,427 --> 01:48:42,264
.. of the Nobel Peace Prize,
the diploma and the gold medal.

1724
01:48:47,312 --> 01:48:49,063
There's no question about it.

1725
01:48:49,898 --> 01:48:51,273
He's done.

1726
01:48:55,070 --> 01:48:58,781
I accept
the Nobel Prize for Peace...

1727
01:49:01,284 --> 01:49:06,922
... at a moment when 22 million
Negroes of the United States...

1728
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:09,625
... are engag...

1729
01:49:27,978 --> 01:49:31,689
Sorry to interrupt, sir.
Your next appointment is here.

1730
01:49:32,148 --> 01:49:34,483
The doctor first, Miss Gandy.

1731
01:49:34,651 --> 01:49:36,110
Yes, of course.

1732
01:49:38,321 --> 01:49:42,575
Send him in in a few minutes.
Thank you.

1733
01:51:41,945 --> 01:51:44,113
Stay strong, Edgar.

1734
01:52:15,311 --> 01:52:17,646
You stay strong, Edgar.

1735
01:52:18,606 --> 01:52:20,983
Stay strong.
Unh!

1736
01:52:45,425 --> 01:52:47,301
... the parade as it makes its way...

1737
01:52:47,369 --> 01:52:49,428
... to the Capitol Building
for the inauguration.

1738
01:52:52,515 --> 01:52:56,769
You can see the Roosevelt High
Marching Band leading the way.

1739
01:52:59,272 --> 01:53:03,692
The motorcade is making progress
down Pennsylvania Avenue...

1740
01:53:05,069 --> 01:53:08,030
... carrying our 37th president.

1741
01:53:14,204 --> 01:53:16,872
Richard Milhous Nixon
waves to the crowd.

1742
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:20,042
Yep, there's the president
and his wife Pat...

1743
01:53:20,585 --> 01:53:22,211
... happily waving.

1744
01:53:58,081 --> 01:54:00,415
When morals decline...

1745
01:54:01,209 --> 01:54:03,585
... and good men do nothing...

1746
01:54:04,546 --> 01:54:06,588
... evil flourishes.

1747
01:54:09,926 --> 01:54:14,596
Every citizen has a duty to learn
of this that threatens his home...

1748
01:54:16,099 --> 01:54:17,266
... his children.

1749
01:54:21,604 --> 01:54:25,941
A society uninterested and
unwilling to learn from the past...

1750
01:54:26,734 --> 01:54:27,860
... is doomed.

1751
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:33,949
We must never forget
our history.

1752
01:54:39,747 --> 01:54:42,624
We must never
lower our guard.

1753
01:54:49,173 --> 01:54:55,262
Even today, there are organizations
that have America as their prime target.

1754
01:54:55,430 --> 01:54:59,683
They would destroy the safety and
the happiness of every individual...

1755
01:54:59,893 --> 01:55:03,312
... and thrust us into
a condition of lawlessness...

1756
01:55:03,479 --> 01:55:07,024
... immorality that passes
the imagination.

1757
01:55:08,985 --> 01:55:11,653
The president will see you now,
Mr. Hoover.

1758
01:55:11,988 --> 01:55:13,155
Alrighty.

1759
01:55:24,626 --> 01:55:26,168
Edgar, come in.

1760
01:55:37,472 --> 01:55:40,349
Oh, I am so sorry,
Mr. Hoover.

1761
01:55:40,516 --> 01:55:42,601
You weren't answering
your telephone.

1762
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:46,438
You had a photo session
with a retiring agent.

1763
01:55:46,606 --> 01:55:48,023
He's leaving now.

1764
01:55:49,025 --> 01:55:50,359
Where is Clyde?

1765
01:55:52,862 --> 01:55:56,031
It's a bad day for him, sir.

1766
01:56:00,036 --> 01:56:03,872
Will you... will you schedule
a dinner for us, please...

1767
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:06,208
... in our old corner booth?

1768
01:56:07,377 --> 01:56:09,878
I'm afraid
he's too tired today, sir.

1769
01:56:10,046 --> 01:56:12,214
Perhaps you'd like
to dine at his house?

1770
01:56:12,382 --> 01:56:14,299
I think he'd like that.

1771
01:56:16,135 --> 01:56:17,219
Yes.

1772
01:56:18,221 --> 01:56:20,347
Yes, thank you, Miss Gandy.

1773
01:56:26,771 --> 01:56:27,813
Helen?

1774
01:56:32,068 --> 01:56:33,151
Yes?

1775
01:56:36,072 --> 01:56:38,573
Do I kill everything that I love?

1776
01:56:42,078 --> 01:56:44,579
He's not gone yet, Edgar.

1777
01:56:48,584 --> 01:56:50,627
And everything that we've built?

1778
01:56:51,587 --> 01:56:52,587
No.

1779
01:56:53,172 --> 01:56:56,758
The Bureau is stronger
than just you and me now.

1780
01:56:58,219 --> 01:57:01,263
Your child is sure
and keeps this country safe.

1781
01:57:08,479 --> 01:57:09,938
Helen, if any...

1782
01:57:10,356 --> 01:57:11,960
... if anything ever
happens to me...

1783
01:57:11,961 --> 01:57:14,860
... I need you to do something
for me, do you understand?

1784
01:57:16,487 --> 01:57:17,821
Of course.

1785
01:57:19,615 --> 01:57:22,200
Nixon, he's gonna come for it all.

1786
01:57:24,203 --> 01:57:26,872
He'll crucify me and my Bureau.

1787
01:57:28,499 --> 01:57:34,129
I'm afraid of what will happen if
I'm not here to protect it, Miss Gandy.

1788
01:57:34,630 --> 01:57:36,631
Your private files, sir?

1789
01:57:39,093 --> 01:57:42,137
Then no one
will ever find them.

1790
01:57:45,308 --> 01:57:46,641
Thank you, Helen.

1791
01:57:57,653 --> 01:58:00,155
No matter what kind
of pressure they put on?

1792
01:58:01,365 --> 01:58:03,200
No matter how much?

1793
01:58:03,367 --> 01:58:04,993
Yes, Edgar.

1794
01:58:05,995 --> 01:58:08,121
No matter how much pressure.

1795
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:12,000
I promise you.

1796
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:15,962
Thank you, Helen.

1797
01:58:27,767 --> 01:58:31,103
Well, did Nixon
ask for your resignation?

1798
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:35,899
No, he wanted to know
what we had in the files on him.

1799
01:58:36,359 --> 01:58:37,984
What did you say?

1800
01:58:38,528 --> 01:58:41,071
I said, "What files, sir?"

1801
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:43,156
But he knows.

1802
01:58:43,866 --> 01:58:48,917
He wants us to expand our wiretaps
to include news reporters now, Clyde.

1803
01:58:49,956 --> 01:58:53,291
We can't do that,
especially not now.

1804
01:58:53,459 --> 01:58:55,168
That's the problem, Clyde.

1805
01:58:55,336 --> 01:59:00,215
If I don't agree to do his black bag
jobs, he'll create his own private force.

1806
01:59:00,675 --> 01:59:03,135
Oh, that's illegal.

1807
01:59:03,553 --> 01:59:09,224
Yes, well, he didn't say it outright,
but I saw it in his eyes.

1808
01:59:09,392 --> 01:59:11,393
He won't be controlled, Clyde.

1809
01:59:11,561 --> 01:59:15,480
He's a menace who'll do anything
to hold on to power.

1810
01:59:16,732 --> 01:59:18,733
Right.
I see.

1811
01:59:19,569 --> 01:59:23,905
Yes. See, I never played his game,
that's the problem.

1812
01:59:24,073 --> 01:59:26,533
And if to some what I did
seemed like rule-bending...

1813
01:59:26,701 --> 01:59:30,120
... then perhaps they need
to figure out what it is they did...

1814
01:59:30,288 --> 01:59:33,748
... that made them feel
blackmailed or intimidated.

1815
01:59:34,250 --> 01:59:36,251
I wasn't thinking that.

1816
01:59:37,503 --> 01:59:41,464
Then what?
What were you thinking?

1817
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:46,386
I was thinking it might
be time for us to retire.

1818
01:59:47,430 --> 01:59:48,889
Shut up, Clyde.

1819
01:59:50,725 --> 01:59:53,602
You built a great thing, Edgar.

1820
01:59:54,353 --> 01:59:57,647
And if you stop now,
you'll be celebrated.

1821
01:59:58,524 --> 02:00:00,609
That's what you've
always wanted, isn't it?

1822
02:00:00,776 --> 02:00:03,445
Our country's lasting adoration?

1823
02:00:03,613 --> 02:00:06,114
Well, there's a chance
you could have it.

1824
02:00:06,949 --> 02:00:10,368
Yes.
Yes, and why wouldn't I? Hmm?

1825
02:00:10,536 --> 02:00:12,162
Why wouldn't I, Clyde?

1826
02:00:12,330 --> 02:00:15,874
I saved this country
from a Bolshevik invasion...

1827
02:00:16,042 --> 02:00:19,961
... rid this country of radicals,
captured Machine Gun Kelly...

1828
02:00:20,129 --> 02:00:23,548
... killed Dillinger, captured Karpis,
convicted Bruno Hauptmann.

1829
02:00:23,758 --> 02:00:27,344
And now, with my last breath when
I try to help save this country again...

1830
02:00:27,511 --> 02:00:30,013
... I'm rewarded
with a forced retirement?

1831
02:00:30,181 --> 02:00:32,974
I will not go down in this manner
and the fact that you suggest that...

1832
02:00:33,142 --> 02:00:35,518
... makes me question
your very loyalty.

1833
02:00:36,562 --> 02:00:38,563
My loyalty, Edgar?

1834
02:00:38,773 --> 02:00:41,191
Yes, your loyalty, Clyde.

1835
02:00:42,276 --> 02:00:45,070
I read your manuscript, Edgar.

1836
02:00:46,155 --> 02:00:48,490
You didn't arrest Karpis.

1837
02:00:48,658 --> 02:00:52,827
And you know as well as I do there
was no white horse in the street...

1838
02:00:53,829 --> 02:00:56,039
... no gun in the back seat.

1839
02:00:56,999 --> 02:01:01,503
And you didn't kill Dillinger.
Agent Purvis did.

1840
02:01:02,004 --> 02:01:05,882
But you kept
all the glory for yourself.

1841
02:01:06,217 --> 02:01:10,845
And Machine Gun Kelly never said,
"Don't shoot, G-Men."

1842
02:01:11,514 --> 02:01:16,977
You made that up
to sell comic books, Edgar.

1843
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:22,315
And when we went to the scene
of the greatest crime of the century...

1844
02:01:22,900 --> 02:01:26,945
... Mr. Lindbergh didn't come
out and shake your hand...

1845
02:01:27,113 --> 02:01:31,574
... and express his faith
in the FBI.

1846
02:01:31,742 --> 02:01:38,039
He called you a fussy little man,
and he refused to even meet you.

1847
02:01:40,376 --> 02:01:43,003
And you didn't
arrest Hauptmann.

1848
02:01:44,171 --> 02:01:46,464
Agent Sisk did.

1849
02:01:46,632 --> 02:01:51,136
You weren't even at the scene, Edgar.
Only the photo op.

1850
02:01:51,304 --> 02:01:55,348
Edgar, most of what you wrote
is exaggeration...

1851
02:01:55,516 --> 02:02:00,895
... some of it blatant lies, and I don't
even know if you realize it anymore.

1852
02:02:02,773 --> 02:02:04,899
Edgar...

1853
02:02:05,067 --> 02:02:09,070
... you can lie to everyone else,
the whole world...

1854
02:02:09,238 --> 02:02:12,907
... for your own sake,
for the sake of the Bureau...

1855
02:02:13,617 --> 02:02:15,744
... but you cannot lie to me.

1856
02:02:19,248 --> 02:02:22,667
I should've never given you
your job, Clyde.

1857
02:02:24,420 --> 02:02:25,854
You know that?

1858
02:02:27,923 --> 02:02:30,216
You weren't even qualified.

1859
02:02:33,304 --> 02:02:36,264
You remember the day
you came in for your interview?

1860
02:02:37,475 --> 02:02:39,184
I do.

1861
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:45,808
You walked into my office
and you fixed my window...

1862
02:02:45,816 --> 02:02:48,526
... you picked up
my handkerchief.

1863
02:02:48,944 --> 02:02:50,712
You handed it to me.

1864
02:02:52,990 --> 02:02:55,658
You remember why
I was sweating, Clyde?

1865
02:02:57,203 --> 02:02:59,788
It's because you were exercising.

1866
02:03:01,957 --> 02:03:03,291
No, I was...

1867
02:03:04,502 --> 02:03:06,461
I was sweating because I...

1868
02:03:07,296 --> 02:03:09,464
I knew at that very moment...

1869
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:13,635
I knew at that
very moment that I...

1870
02:03:15,137 --> 02:03:16,638
I needed you.

1871
02:03:18,307 --> 02:03:21,976
And I've never needed
anyone else in my entire life.

1872
02:03:24,063 --> 02:03:25,647
Not like that.

1873
02:03:27,525 --> 02:03:29,943
So I began to perspire.

1874
02:03:30,861 --> 02:03:32,070
I know.

1875
02:03:34,990 --> 02:03:37,492
Edgar, are you all right?

1876
02:03:38,494 --> 02:03:39,828
Yes, yes, it's...

1877
02:03:40,955 --> 02:03:45,166
It's just indigestion, Clyde.

1878
02:03:48,754 --> 02:03:52,924
Let's go to dinner tomorrow night,
shall we? Our old corner booth.

1879
02:03:54,593 --> 02:03:56,177
Perhaps if I feel better.

1880
02:03:56,345 --> 02:03:58,096
Yes.

1881
02:03:58,264 --> 02:03:59,514
And you must...

1882
02:03:59,682 --> 02:04:04,477
You must... we have a great
many things to discuss.

1883
02:04:04,645 --> 02:04:08,523
And now I can't trust anyone else
at the Bureau right now.

1884
02:04:10,025 --> 02:04:11,985
Can only depend on you.

1885
02:04:31,505 --> 02:04:33,506
Thank you, Edgar.

1886
02:04:48,439 --> 02:04:49,898
Good night, Clyde.

1887
02:04:51,525 --> 02:04:53,276
Good night, Edgar.

1888
02:05:19,053 --> 02:05:20,595
Welcome home, Mr. Hoover.

1889
02:05:20,763 --> 02:05:21,804
Oh, thank you, Annie.

1890
02:05:21,972 --> 02:05:24,641
Bozo, Bozo, G-Boy, come here.

1891
02:05:24,808 --> 02:05:27,852
The very essence
of our democracy...

1892
02:05:28,187 --> 02:05:32,607
... is rooted in a belief
in the worth of the individual.

1893
02:05:33,275 --> 02:05:38,154
That life has meaning that
transcends any man-made system...

1894
02:05:38,781 --> 02:05:42,450
... that love is the greatest force
on earth...

1895
02:05:44,119 --> 02:05:46,788
... far more enduring
than hatred...

1896
02:05:47,831 --> 02:05:51,793
... or the unnatural
divisions of mankind.

1897
02:06:02,471 --> 02:06:03,638
Yes?

1898
02:06:04,348 --> 02:06:07,809
This is Annie from
Mr. Hoover's residence.

1899
02:06:07,977 --> 02:06:10,395
Mr. Hoover has passed.

1900
02:06:39,341 --> 02:06:40,550
- Yeah?
- Sir.

1901
02:06:44,179 --> 02:06:46,514
Jesus Christ.

1902
02:06:47,182 --> 02:06:49,434
That old cocksucker.

1903
02:06:49,602 --> 02:06:52,270
I'll get a speech prepared.
We should go on television.

1904
02:06:52,438 --> 02:06:53,938
Not yet.

1905
02:06:54,106 --> 02:06:58,401
First seal off his office, change his
locks, do whatever you have to do.

1906
02:06:58,569 --> 02:07:01,195
I want those fucking files.

1907
02:07:02,031 --> 02:07:03,197
Yes, sir.

1908
02:07:12,041 --> 02:07:13,708
Oh, good.

1909
02:07:14,543 --> 02:07:16,377
Come in.

1910
02:07:21,925 --> 02:07:24,218
He's upstairs.

1911
02:09:28,510 --> 02:09:32,847
Ladies and gentlemen, it is with
a profound sense of personal loss...

1912
02:09:33,015 --> 02:09:36,017
... that I learned of the death
of J. Edgar Hoover.

1913
02:09:36,685 --> 02:09:40,855
This truly remarkable man
has served his country for 48 years...

1914
02:09:41,023 --> 02:09:43,691
... under eight presidents,
as director of the FBI...

1915
02:09:43,859 --> 02:09:49,697
... with unparalleled devotion
and ability and dedication.

1916
02:09:49,865 --> 02:09:54,535
For 25 years, from the time I came to
Washington as a freshman congressman...

1917
02:09:55,078 --> 02:09:59,373
... he has been one of my closest
personal friends and advisors.

1918
02:09:59,541 --> 02:10:03,461
And every American, in my opinion,
owes J. Edgar Hoover a great debt...

1919
02:10:03,629 --> 02:10:08,049
... for building the FBI into the finest
law enforcement organization...

1920
02:10:08,217 --> 02:10:10,134
... in the entire world.

1921
02:10:11,970 --> 02:10:14,791
I've ordered that all the flags
of the government buildings...

1922
02:10:14,792 --> 02:10:16,891
... be flown at half mast...

1923
02:10:17,059 --> 02:10:19,727
... but I will say that, in doing so,
that Edgar Hoover...

1924
02:10:19,895 --> 02:10:24,607
... because of his indomitable courage
against sometimes very vicious attack...

1925
02:10:24,775 --> 02:10:31,072
...has made certain that the flag
of the FBI will always fly high.

1926
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:38,246
The FBI is the eternal monument
honoring this great American.

1927
02:10:40,249 --> 02:10:42,083
Funny how even the dearest face...

1928
02:10:42,251 --> 02:10:44,752
... will fade away in time...

1929
02:10:45,295 --> 02:10:48,300
... but most clearly
I remember your eyes...

1930
02:10:48,301 --> 02:10:50,258
... with a sort of
teasing smile in them...

1931
02:10:50,676 --> 02:10:53,427
... and the feeling
of that soft spot...

1932
02:10:53,595 --> 02:10:56,764
... just northeast
of the corner of your mouth.
