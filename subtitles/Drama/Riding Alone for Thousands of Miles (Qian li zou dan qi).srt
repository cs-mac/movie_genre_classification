1
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,981
For unexplainable reasons

2
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,162
my son Ken-ichi and l

3
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:30,221
have been estranged for 10 years.

4
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:35,035
There is a profound chasm between us

5
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,105
which hurts me deeply.

6
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:41,438
I want us to be close again.

7
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,847
I have learned that

8
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:50,146
Ken-ichi is in the hospital.

9
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:54,554
His wife Rie has asked me to visit him.

10
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:55,647
She has suggested to me

11
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:57,856
that it would be an opportunity

12
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:05,231
for Ken-ichi and I to speak to each other

13
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:14,163
and to improve our relationship.

14
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,337
Hence I have come to Tokyo.

15
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,486
You must be surprised at the changes

16
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:31,991
in Tokyo over the past 10 years.

17
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,967
Ken-ichi has been unwell for awhile.

18
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,404
He's suffering from stomach pain.

19
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,602
It often disturbs him at night.

20
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,608
He hasn't been diagnosed yet.

21
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,152
Excuse me.

22
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,988
Give me a moment.

23
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,598
I'll tell Ken-ichi you're here.

24
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:23,437
He doesn't know that you've come.

25
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:45,997
Father is here to see you.

26
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,660
Why don't you let him in?

27
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,996
He's come a long way to see you.

28
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,098
Why should I see him?

29
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,340
Who asked him to come?

30
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,408
Did you?

31
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,409
I never said I wanted to see him.

32
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,144
Please don't talk like this.

33
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,014
Enough, I don't want to see him.

34
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,472
Father.

35
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,704
Please wait.

36
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,216
Father

37
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:50,427
he's sick and in great pain.

38
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:54,759
Don't take his words to heart.

39
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,232
Forgive him.

40
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:00,835
Let me talk to him.

41
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,453
This tape

42
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,284
was made by Ken-ichi in China.

43
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:27,292
It was broadcast as part of a TV special.

44
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,539
Please have a look at his work.

45
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,379
Make sure you watch it.

46
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,279
Please.

47
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:59,866
Mr. Takata, it's ready.

48
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:09,176
Thank you. Would you like a drink?

49
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,111
No, thank you.

50
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,738
I have another appointment.

51
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,275
Do you know how-to use a VCR?

52
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:16,541
Yes.

53
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,704
Let me introduce

54
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,446
an expert in oriental folk arts

55
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,914
Mr. Ken-ichi Takata.

56
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,914
He is widely published on the subject.

57
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:58,947
We have some footage

58
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,327
shot by Mr. Ken-ichi of a mask opera.

59
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,872
This opera originates from Yunnan Province.

60
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:32,654
This is Mr. Ken-ichi Takata

61
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,461
from the faculty of Oriental Folk Arts

62
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,723
at the University of Tokyo.

63
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,731
He's here to see you perform.

64
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,699
Thank you.

65
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,633
This is Mr. Li Jiamin.

66
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:42,725
He's our lead singer.

67
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,335
This is amazing.

68
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,433
You are incredible.

69
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,367
He says you are incredible.

70
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,769
I could be better. I have a cold today.

71
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,506
Come back and I'll perform

72
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:53,746
Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles.

73
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,446
I'm not familiar with this particular opera.

74
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,294
It's a mask opera about Lord Guan.

75
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,357
Oh...I see...the Lord Guan...

76
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:11,428
from the story

77
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,900
The Romance of the Three Kingdoms?

78
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,368
He actually knows

79
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,237
who Lord Guan is.

80
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:18,305
Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles

81
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,637
is the greatest of all mask operas.

82
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,772
I'm the greatest singer of it.

83
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,289
Then, this is a rare chance.

84
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,323
Can't you sing a little for me now?

85
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,261
My voice is not up to it today.

86
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,888
Ken-ichi is leaving China tonight.

87
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,556
Then, some other time.

88
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,699
It's a deal.

89
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,404
I'll come back to Yunnan next year.

90
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,438
I promise you an unforgettable performance.

91
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:12,091
How's the catch today?

92
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,558
Nothing much.

93
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,668
This is Takata.

94
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,108
Father

95
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:37,306
I've been calling and calling.

96
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,749
Have you been fishing?

97
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,959
I've received Ken-ichi's diagnosis.

98
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,761
Cancer of the liver.

99
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,893
It is terminal.

100
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,331
I haven't told Ken-ichi yet.

101
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:10,674
I don't think...I have the courage.

102
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,617
He thinks

103
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,954
he will be discharged soon.

104
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:37,638
I've always hoped...in my heart

105
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:45,845
that our family could enjoy a meal together

106
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,616
Father

107
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,190
Ken-ichi

108
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,017
and l.

109
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,390
Now I'm not sure

110
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:05,930
that's going to happen.

111
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,233
I need to find

112
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:39,199
the singer Mr. Li Jiamin.

113
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,804
I don't know what is out there

114
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:49,211
and I'm not good at dealing with people.

115
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,142
However

116
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,747
I feel compelled to go.

117
00:10:54,020 --> 00:11:00,755
I need to do something for my dying son.

118
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,138
Mr. Takata.

119
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,541
Do you want to rest in Kunming

120
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,609
or go to Lijiang immediately?

121
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,008
Lijiang, immediately.

122
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,773
Fine.

123
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:25,015
LIJIANG

124
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:27,748
Rie?

125
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,519
It's me.

126
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,184
I'm at Lijiang

127
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:37,256
in Yunnan Province, China.

128
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:39,564
Yunnan?

129
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,599
What are you doing there?

130
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,163
I'm filming "Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles".

131
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:49,131
You want to film it

132
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,811
for Ken-ichi?

133
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,608
Actually

134
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,844
I gave you that tape

135
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:03,016
so you could learn more about him.

136
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,323
Father

137
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,758
please come back.

138
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,688
No.

139
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,635
The travel agency has arranged everything.

140
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,262
Please don't be worried about me.

141
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,301
Just don't tell Ken-ichi

142
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,908
what I'm planning.

143
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,142
Please.

144
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:43,056
LI VILLAGE

145
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:45,765
Mr. Takata.

146
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:50,603
This is Lingo. He's a village tour guide.

147
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,798
He speaks a little Japanese.

148
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:02,248
Lingo.

149
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,151
Remember Ken-ichi was here last year?

150
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,088
He promised to film the mask opera.

151
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:10,022
This is his father.

152
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,685
So you're Ken-ichi's father.

153
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,924
His father.

154
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:22,765
Ken-ichi is...my friend.

155
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,069
He's a very...good friend.

156
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,059
Lingo, how is everything going?

157
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,219
Just a second.

158
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,230
Are you Li Jiamin?

159
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,698
No.

160
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,064
Lingo, I told you we only wanted Li.

161
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,303
It doesn't have to be Li.

162
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,639
Other actors can also play Lord Guan.

163
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,267
No way. Mr. Takata only wants Li Jiamin.

164
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,043
If he insists on Li

165
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,912
there will be no show today.

166
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,080
Why not?

167
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,014
Look, Li enjoys a drink or two

168
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,818
which is usually fine.

169
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:12,352
Then, during a rehearsal

170
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,121
a stage hand mentioned

171
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,248
he had a bastard son.

172
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,792
This upset him so much

173
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,226
that he grabbed a wooden dagger

174
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,298
and stabbed the guy in the face.

175
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:28,392
He was arrested

176
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,325
and sentenced to 3 years in prison.

177
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:32,438
Please tell him

178
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,669
it doesn't have to be Li Jiamin performing.

179
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,001
All the actors are very good.

180
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,107
Once the mask is on

181
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,419
it doesn't matter who is behind it.

182
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,080
No-one can tell the difference.

183
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,219
Even a native can't tell

184
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,493
the difference between the voices.

185
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,358
So how could a Japanese person?

186
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,904
Does it really have to be Li?

187
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,040
His son wanted to film Li.

188
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,108
He is making this film for his son.

189
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,803
No-one else will do.

190
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,442
But Li Jiamin is in prison

191
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,040
for 3 years.

192
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:17,450
Even if he behaves well

193
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,152
and becomes a model prisoner

194
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:21,416
he won't be released for a year or two.

195
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,790
Takata should come back.

196
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,158
There will be other chances.

197
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,785
The show is always playing.

198
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:43,068
Jasmine

199
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,740
please help me.

200
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:50,049
Mr. Takata, this is not about money.

201
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,449
I'm in a difficult position.

202
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,021
I'm just a tour guide.

203
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,319
How can I get a foreigner

204
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:02,929
permission to film inside a prison?

205
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:04,829
It is impossible.

206
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:09,802
Please help me.

207
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,939
I really want to help.

208
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:15,975
But this is beyond my ability

209
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,211
and my job description.

210
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,179
Please forgive me.

211
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,343
My contract is only for 3 days.

212
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:28,078
I've been assigned other jobs.

213
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:36,388
I'll see you off at Kunming Airport.

214
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,223
I'm sorry.

215
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:44,203
Jasmine

216
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,940
please ask your boss

217
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,467
if I could employ another interpreter.

218
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,889
Hi, Boss. This is Jasmine.

219
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,036
That Japanese tourist

220
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,436
Mr. Takata, who arrived 2 days ago

221
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,303
is asking for a new interpreter.

222
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,081
Mr. Takata

223
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:40,053
my boss cannot help with your plan

224
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,990
to film inside the prison.

225
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,387
He also says

226
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,667
he doesn't have another interpreter available.

227
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,864
Please forget about this idea.

228
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,043
Mr. Takata.

229
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,111
Is that actor, Mr. Li, so important

230
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,909
to your film?

231
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,084
Excuse me.

232
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,219
Please turn around.

233
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,562
Turn around.

234
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,595
Turn around.

235
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:22,435
Jasmine

236
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,300
he wants to go back.

237
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:32,011
The opera is

238
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,946
Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles.

239
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,184
Lord Guan traveled a thousand miles

240
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:41,244
to help a friend

241
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,190
which is a big deal.

242
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,351
A man must be loyal.

243
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:52,431
I can't understand what they are saying

244
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:56,560
but I need their help.

245
00:18:57,036 --> 00:19:01,996
Without them, I can't go anywhere.

246
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,943
For the first time, I feel helpless.

247
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:15,418
I wonder if Ken-ichi would feel the same way.

248
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,023
Mr. Takata

249
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,531
about your plan

250
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:29,462
Jasmine cannot help you

251
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,636
but I am able to.

252
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,635
Much obliged.

253
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,470
Thank you.

254
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,171
No problem.

255
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,787
There are no costumes

256
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:52,225
or props in the prison.

257
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,693
We'll have to take them.

258
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,389
Excuse me.

259
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:00,366
There are no props and costumes at the prison.

260
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,733
He's getting them.

261
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:07,607
Mr. Takata

262
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,775
I must confide in you.

263
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,445
Lingo is my friend.

264
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,013
He is very enthusiastic

265
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:17,283
but he really doesn't know much.

266
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:18,351
So, let me tell you

267
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,410
the basic procedures to follow.

268
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,805
First, go to the Office of Foreign Affairs.

269
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,276
Tell them why you want to visit the prison.

270
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:48,440
Office of Foreign Affairs.

271
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,083
If they approve

272
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,812
then go to the Bureau of Justice.

273
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,849
Bureau of Justice.

274
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,090
If they approve

275
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,115
then all's well.

276
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:05,155
Bureau of Justice...approves

277
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,233
If you have any difficulties

278
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:10,803
or Lingo can't properly translate for you

279
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,471
please call me.

280
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:15,099
I'll translate for you over the phone.

281
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:19,634
You have my phone number.

282
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,511
I'll leave this car for you

283
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,581
and charge it to your account.

284
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,413
You need to sign this form.

285
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:37,655
It's your request to change the interpreter.

286
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:39,762
Please sign here.

287
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,396
OFFICE OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS

288
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,874
Director Li is in a meeting.

289
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,309
He's been briefed on your situation.

290
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,445
He will be available soon.

291
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:54,470
He won't be long.

292
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:59,274
We have to wait.

293
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:11,190
Lingo, are they all...thank-you banners?

294
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:14,766
Yes.

295
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:17,166
This means "Thank you".

296
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:21,734
It's calligraphy.

297
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,207
A Chinese tradition.

298
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:25,537
Tradition?

299
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:35,446
Lingo

300
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:38,780
Please.

301
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:44,191
Write them down?

302
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:50,499
Please sit down.

303
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:52,463
No need to get up.

304
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:55,240
I've checked the files.

305
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:58,310
Indeed

306
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,813
there was a Japanese man named Ken-ichi

307
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,371
who traveled here frequently.

308
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:05,651
He enjoyed our mask opera immensely.

309
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:07,516
He also visited Li Village.

310
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,255
You are...?

311
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:11,924
I'm a tour guide from Li Village.

312
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,225
I'm Lingo.

313
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,460
He is my client.

314
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,226
This is Ken-ichi's father.

315
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,500
Welcome.

316
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,661
Please have a seat.

317
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,448
Lingo, can you translate

318
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:38,679
everything I am saying?

319
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:40,753
My Japanese is not very fluent

320
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,688
but I can take notes and translate later.

321
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:46,583
Okay, I'll talk and you take notes.

322
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:47,927
Okay.

323
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,562
You see

324
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:54,261
to let someone film inside a prison

325
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:55,930
is very difficult.

326
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:58,766
His request is totally without precedent

327
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:02,041
which makes it even more difficult.

328
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,476
You know

329
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:06,912
for a foreigner to visit a prison

330
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,402
is not a straightforward matter.

331
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,483
Even if it was

332
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,284
the procedures are complicated.

333
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,688
It may seem simple, but it's not.

334
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,485
It is very complex.

335
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,920
Okay, okay, I'm coming.

336
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:28,727
So, that puts an end to it.

337
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,703
Lingo

338
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:32,671
please explain these difficulties to him.

339
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:36,041
He doesn't have to visit this prisoner.

340
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,879
Many singers can perform this opera.

341
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:42,712
They could be even better than Li Jiamin.

342
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,552
I advise him to stop trying.

343
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:47,712
All right?

344
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,614
Mr. Li said

345
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:58,059
this is

346
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:00,957
too difficult.

347
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:06,294
Because

348
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:08,036
a foreigner

349
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,833
I'm a foreigner.

350
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,384
Law

351
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:20,085
Law is

352
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,882
difficult.

353
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,681
Because

354
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:26,680
Difficult?

355
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,653
Time

356
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,791
no time.

357
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,371
Dictionary

358
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,773
Check

359
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:42,331
Please check.

360
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:49,974
Law

361
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,907
Law?

362
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:00,086
Difficult?

363
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,027
Difficult law.

364
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,424
Difficult law.

365
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,155
Easy for the Chinese

366
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:12,538
but for foreigners

367
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:16,531
very, very difficult.

368
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:22,410
Government...Law.

369
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:27,419
Government...Law.

370
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:32,658
Hello.

371
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:33,886
Hello, Jasmine.

372
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:38,521
Sorry to bother you.

373
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:42,828
I need you to translate for me.

374
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,407
This is Lingo.

375
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:50,170
How did it go?

376
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:53,545
It was a disaster.

377
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:56,173
Get him a ticket and send him home.

378
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:59,714
That's the end of it.

379
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,580
Let me explain this to him.

380
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,121
Mr. Takata, telephone.

381
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,054
Mr. Takata

382
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:13,526
I'm sorry. Your request was refused.

383
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:17,161
Lingo will book you on the next flight.

384
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:19,499
Thank you.

385
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:22,804
Mr. Takata

386
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,004
goodbye.

387
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,179
Please return to Japan.

388
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,849
Because...government policy.

389
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:37,744
My Japanese

390
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:38,784
is not good.

391
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,216
I'm sorry.

392
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:45,657
I'm sorry.

393
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:49,665
Thank you.

394
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,950
You want silk banners?

395
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,151
Which one?

396
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:07,686
The best one.

397
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,678
These are the best. What size?

398
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:13,615
This one.

399
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:41,978
Director Li.

400
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:43,588
Lingo.

401
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,283
I've been waiting for hours.

402
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:48,594
We had a long meeting.

403
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:51,163
I forgot about the video.

404
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:54,333
Let's have a look at this tape.

405
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,631
Let's go in.

406
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,709
Why does Mr. Takata

407
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:06,011
want to use this tape

408
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:07,913
to talk to me?

409
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,039
Lingo

410
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,015
we don't understand Japanese.

411
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,219
No problem.

412
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,821
I have a Chinese version.

413
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:17,823
Jasmine translated it

414
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:18,847
and faxed it to me.

415
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,115
That's complicated.

416
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,328
Of course it is.

417
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,230
I've been practicing for hours.

418
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,027
Let's see it then.

419
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:42,343
Why isn't he talking?

420
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:48,849
Director Li

421
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:54,949
Forgive me for speaking to you like this

422
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:58,692
but I have no other option.

423
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:07,962
A long time ago

424
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:13,938
a long time ago

425
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:19,248
I hurt my son Ken-ichi deeply.

426
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:27,953
He has never forgiven me.

427
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:41,340
Recently

428
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,309
my son was diagnosed with cancer.

429
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:58,056
He may not have very long to live.

430
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:04,263
He has a deep passion for

431
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:06,857
Chinese folk operas.

432
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:12,905
He promised to return here this year

433
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:22,041
to film Li Jiamin's performance.

434
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:30,822
I don't know at this point

435
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:36,988
what else I can do for my son.

436
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:49,072
Maybe filming "Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles"

437
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:56,408
is the only thing I can do for him now.

438
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:05,916
Director Li, please help me.

439
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:08,926
Please.

440
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:37,785
Director Li

441
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:41,219
please.

442
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,622
I apologize for calling you so late.

443
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,388
Please help me.

444
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,164
If you think it's possible

445
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:55,133
I'll report it to the Bureau of Foreign Affairs

446
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,134
and ask them

447
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,837
to liaise with the Bureau of Justice

448
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:00,038
to resolve this.

449
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,132
Can you help me with this?

450
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:12,406
PRISON

451
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:28,467
Reform our ways.

452
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:30,602
Redeem ourselves.

453
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,637
Become new people.

454
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:39,543
One, two, three, four.

455
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,613
Are you his interpreter?

456
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:43,982
Yes, but my Japanese is not good.

457
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:46,051
I'll make notes first

458
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:48,076
and get someone to translate later.

459
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:54,622
Let me explain our protocol.

460
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:58,662
Foreigners have filmed here

461
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,296
in the past

462
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,527
but then complained publicly about conditions.

463
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,439
This gives our country a bad image.

464
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,174
Tell him this.

465
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:10,475
Yes.

466
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:11,908
Troublemakers like that are not welcome.

467
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:15,339
I have nothing against him personally.

468
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:20,218
You only want to film one prisoner?

469
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,242
Yes.

470
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:25,080
Prisoner Li Jiamin?

471
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,318
That's right, Li.

472
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:29,926
Mr. Li Jiamin.

473
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:34,299
Just to film him singing?

474
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:38,201
Yes, nothing else.

475
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:40,662
Which opera?

476
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,567
Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles.

477
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:47,475
It sounds like an excellent way

478
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,309
to promote Chinese culture.

479
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:54,152
After all, Lord Guan is not a state secret.

480
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,987
No, he's not.

481
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,511
He's certainly not.

482
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:02,494
I'll give it the Bureau's stamp of approval.

483
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,655
We can film it now.

484
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,571
Testing, do you hear me?

485
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:13,538
Yes.

486
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,774
Perfect.

487
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:17,242
This is the venue.

488
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:18,977
It is our recreation room.

489
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:20,679
The prisoners

490
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,180
use the room

491
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,182
on weekends and public holidays.

492
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,116
It's a place to relax.

493
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:30,648
Can you hear me?

494
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:31,523
Yes.

495
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,717
You can begin now.

496
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:39,264
Thank you, Warden Chen.

497
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:40,390
You're welcome.

498
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:51,476
Report for duty.

499
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:52,500
Come in.

500
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:06,658
Prisoner Yang and the band

501
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:09,661
reporting for duty, Sir.

502
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,597
Take your places.

503
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:13,621
Yes, Sir.

504
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:21,740
Lingo.

505
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,775
This is the prison band.

506
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,710
Some were professionals

507
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,712
others learnt to play here.

508
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,614
They are extremely popular

509
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,742
performing every year for festivals.

510
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:34,519
Please tell him.

511
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:39,424
Thank you. Thank you.

512
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:40,857
Reporting for duty, Sir. Come in.

513
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,231
Prisoner Li Jiamin

514
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:49,167
reporting for duty, Sir.

515
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:50,168
Li.

516
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:52,103
Can you sing “Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles"?

517
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,161
Yes.

518
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,575
What you need to do

519
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:02,581
is this

520
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:05,116
Repent of our sins.

521
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,885
Reform our ways.

522
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:08,853
Redeem ourselves

523
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,844
become new people.

524
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:43,355
Li.

525
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:44,889
Relax, don't be nervous.

526
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:47,722
You should be captured on film at your best.

527
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,895
You know all the pieces, right?

528
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,295
Come on, don't be nervous.

529
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:55,600
Band members, once again.

530
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,364
Ready go.

531
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,351
What's the matter with you, Li?

532
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:22,893
Why aren't you singing?

533
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,353
Li.

534
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,525
Li.

535
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:32,432
What's wrong?

536
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,572
He is waiting for you.

537
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,164
He came all the way from Japan

538
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:39,542
just to film you singing.

539
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,246
He's Ken-ichi's father.

540
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:43,180
The Japanese guy who visited you often.

541
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,416
Please sing.

542
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,213
Ken-ichi is sick.

543
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,283
Please sing for him.

544
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:53,819
Come on.

545
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:06,932
Why are you crying?

546
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:13,239
I'm not in the mood for singing.

547
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:19,677
I just can't.

548
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,236
I'm thinking of my son.

549
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,035
I can't stop thinking about him.

550
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:50,244
I envy Li.

551
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:54,644
He doesn't hide his feelings.

552
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:57,954
It is a blessing

553
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,259
to be able to express one's emotions.

554
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:07,654
If I could reveal my feelings like this

555
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:13,800
my relationship with Ken-ichi would be different

556
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:18,974
Lingo.

557
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:22,080
I don't think

558
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,081
we can film the opera today.

559
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:24,548
Li cannot sing.

560
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,485
Tell Mr. Takata to come back.

561
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,888
Let me know well in advance.

562
00:41:29,888 --> 00:41:31,048
Please tell him.

563
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:33,958
Mr. Takata.

564
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,789
Stop crying, Li.

565
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:40,864
We know you'd like to see your son.

566
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:43,968
This is Takata.

567
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:47,335
I don't understand what's going on here.

568
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:49,840
Can you please help me?

569
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,646
Are you at the prison?

570
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:55,847
What happened?

571
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,508
We couldn't film the opera.

572
00:41:58,049 --> 00:41:59,684
Li couldn't stop crying.

573
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:00,776
As the music started

574
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,349
he began to cry.

575
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:05,084
Why?

576
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,692
He's upset about his son

577
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,761
who he's never seen.

578
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:13,031
He longs to meet his son.

579
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,022
The warden stopped everything

580
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,530
when he saw Li crying.

581
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:19,504
What will you do?

582
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:20,835
He couldn't sing.

583
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:23,641
Li wasn't like that before.

584
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:26,804
He is a different man in prison.

585
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,648
Please pass the phone to Takata.

586
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,115
I'll explain to him.

587
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:36,614
Mr. Takata, your phone.

588
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,523
It's me.

589
00:42:57,876 --> 00:42:59,104
Jasmine.

590
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:01,868
This is Takata.

591
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,381
Mr. Takata.

592
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:04,609
Sorry to disturb you so late.

593
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:12,620
I've been thinking.

594
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:18,426
I've decided to bring Li's son to him.

595
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:21,831
You want to bring the boy to Li?

596
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:23,698
Yes.

597
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:26,170
Please reconsider, Mr. Takata.

598
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:30,642
Li was over emotional today.

599
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:32,510
Warden Chen said

600
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,705
he'd be fine in a few days.

601
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:38,549
The boy lives in Stone Village.

602
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:42,754
It is in a very remote place.

603
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:44,483
This detour will only delay your plan.

604
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:48,750
I've made up my mind.

605
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:50,862
Mr. Takata.

606
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:52,697
Isn't making the film for Ken-ichi

607
00:43:52,697 --> 00:43:56,030
the most important thing?

608
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:02,932
Both are of equal importance now.

609
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:08,846
I'm sorry.

610
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:10,905
Please call Lingo now

611
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,710
and ask him to take me to Stone Village tomorrow.

612
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:14,948
Please, I'm sorry.

613
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:16,153
All right.

614
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,475
Lingo.

615
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:38,737
Good evening. May l?

616
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:39,572
Please.

617
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:45,850
What is it?

618
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:46,908
Good night.

619
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:50,020
Goodbye.

620
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,168
Hello.

621
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,304
Is this Mr. Takata?

622
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:08,272
Sorry to bother you again.

623
00:45:09,307 --> 00:45:15,576
What did you say to Lingo?

624
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:17,542
Why did he

625
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:24,079
return the money to me?

626
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:29,317
Will he still help me tomorrow?

627
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:31,529
Mr. Takata.

628
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:33,156
Let me explain.

629
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:36,693
Lingo and I feel very sad

630
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:40,000
about Ken-ichi's illness.

631
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,903
I apologize

632
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,743
for not helping you earlier.

633
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,869
Forgive me.

634
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:48,576
Never mind.

635
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:52,582
I understand.

636
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:56,220
Lingo doesn't feel right

637
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,089
about taking your money

638
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:01,684
when your son is so sick.

639
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:03,961
He will still take you

640
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:07,692
to Stone Village tomorrow.

641
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:11,893
Really?

642
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:14,604
Thank you both.

643
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:21,174
I'm happy that Ken-ichi

644
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,205
has friends like you.

645
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:30,084
Does he have many friends in China?

646
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:34,221
Actually...I don't know Ken-ichi.

647
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:38,690
Lingo doesn't know him very well either.

648
00:46:39,697 --> 00:46:41,332
Lingo said that

649
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:45,769
Ken-ichi hardly has any friends in China.

650
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:48,400
Really?

651
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,105
Lingo said

652
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:54,401
Ken-ichi seldom spoke to anyone.

653
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:59,906
He would stay alone in Lijiang for months.

654
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:03,321
Sometimes he just stared for hours

655
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,152
at the mountains.

656
00:47:06,124 --> 00:47:09,685
He seemed very lonely.

657
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:17,268
I may have said too much.

658
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:18,326
No.

659
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:22,099
Please

660
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:27,172
tell me more about my son.

661
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:32,984
Mr. Takata, I'm afraid that's all I know.

662
00:47:32,984 --> 00:47:34,110
I am sorry.

663
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:36,411
Never mind.

664
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:40,253
I'm sorry it's so late.

665
00:47:40,658 --> 00:47:43,261
Thank you, Jasmine.

666
00:47:43,261 --> 00:47:44,956
Good night.

667
00:48:45,056 --> 00:48:46,523
There's road work ahead.

668
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:12,414
STONE Village

669
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:20,889
Yang Yang's mom died a week ago.

670
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:24,862
He has no other family to care for him.

671
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:28,132
The villagers are taking care of him now.

672
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:30,034
The village chief said

673
00:49:30,034 --> 00:49:33,170
the boy is now being raised by everyone

674
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,572
in this village.

675
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:36,140
That's right.

676
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,335
Li was told about this.

677
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:41,879
That's why he broke down in prison.

678
00:49:41,879 --> 00:49:43,047
This was the reason.

679
00:49:43,047 --> 00:49:46,384
We know why you have come here.

680
00:49:46,384 --> 00:49:48,875
Our committee has already made its decision

681
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:54,049
I cannot give you the details straight away.

682
00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:55,492
Why not?

683
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,262
Before I explain

684
00:49:58,262 --> 00:50:00,822
I must clarify some things.

685
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,528
Please translate what I say.

686
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:05,136
Of course I will.

687
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:06,504
He's my client.

688
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:07,869
Please continue.

689
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:11,309
I want to say two things.

690
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:13,038
Firstly

691
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:16,002
Yang Yang is Li's son

692
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:20,072
born outside of wedlock

693
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,149
but we all accept that.

694
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:24,453
We all agree.

695
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:26,121
This is the first point.

696
00:50:26,424 --> 00:50:27,224
Secondly

697
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:30,828
After 8 years, Li has now decided to claim his son.

698
00:50:30,828 --> 00:50:32,557
We don't have a problem with this.

699
00:50:34,098 --> 00:50:35,463
You'd better translate now.

700
00:50:36,334 --> 00:50:39,064
Why don't you simply say "yes" or "no"?

701
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:41,172
So I can give him an answer now.

702
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:42,537
Yes or "no"?

703
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:46,210
You haven't translated a single word to him.

704
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,145
You should translate everything I've said.

705
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:49,544
You should make yourself clear before I do.

706
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:54,485
I doubt you speak any Japanese.

707
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:56,578
Ridiculous. Of course I do.

708
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,426
This loud discussion is going on for a long time.

709
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:10,196
I suddenly feel like an outsider.

710
00:51:12,136 --> 00:51:13,170
I realize

711
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,330
in a foreign language environment

712
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,475
you can feel very isolated.

713
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:21,640
I'm slowly

714
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:26,246
beginning to understand

715
00:51:27,218 --> 00:51:29,618
why Ken-ichi often visits here.

716
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:35,126
You're supposed to be a translator.

717
00:51:35,126 --> 00:51:38,027
I wouldn't need you if I spoke Japanese.

718
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,164
I know how to translate.

719
00:51:40,164 --> 00:51:42,132
I beg to differ on that.

720
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,127
No signal.

721
00:51:46,537 --> 00:51:49,473
There's no signal here.

722
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:51,964
I know where you can get one.

723
00:51:52,977 --> 00:51:54,945
He's calling a translator.

724
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:57,040
Let's go outside.

725
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:20,304
Why are we going to the roof?

726
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:21,605
You can get a stronger signal.

727
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:23,470
My son has made calls from up here before.

728
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:42,082
Who is Mr. Takata calling?

729
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,963
Jasmine, a translator from Kunming.

730
00:52:45,963 --> 00:52:48,199
Isn't that your job?

731
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:49,633
Are you sure you speak Japanese?

732
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:50,701
Of course I do.

733
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:52,303
The issue is so important

734
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:53,571
we need to get a true professional.

735
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:54,970
Jasmine.

736
00:52:56,574 --> 00:52:57,734
I'm sorry.

737
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:01,108
I don't understand what is being said.

738
00:53:01,412 --> 00:53:02,713
Can you translate for me?

739
00:53:02,713 --> 00:53:04,146
Thank you.

740
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:11,447
Ms Translator.

741
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:14,246
I want to make two points.

742
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:18,462
Firstly, Li didn't register a legal marriage

743
00:53:18,462 --> 00:53:20,264
before his son was born.

744
00:53:20,264 --> 00:53:22,166
We all accept that

745
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:23,360
Yang Yang is Li's son.

746
00:53:24,268 --> 00:53:25,402
This is point one.

747
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:26,337
Secondly

748
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:29,306
at 8 years of age the boy

749
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:31,475
now finds he's got a father.

750
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:34,011
Li's sudden interest is hard to believe

751
00:53:34,011 --> 00:53:36,113
and is confusing for everyone.

752
00:53:36,113 --> 00:53:38,081
Please translate this for him.

753
00:53:40,618 --> 00:53:41,676
It's me.

754
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,623
I totally understand

755
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:49,790
their reservations.

756
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,663
I never said "no" on this matter.

757
00:53:58,502 --> 00:54:00,697
Lingo can't speak a word of Japanese.

758
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:03,240
Mr. Takata needed to know

759
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,509
our feelings on the subject.

760
00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:07,033
Now he really understands

761
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:09,311
we are very relieved.

762
00:54:10,114 --> 00:54:12,082
We have no more issues.

763
00:54:12,516 --> 00:54:16,213
After much discussion, we give our consent

764
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:19,590
to let the boy go. Not for Li's sake

765
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,626
but for the sake of our Japanese friend.

766
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:24,595
Yang Yang can visit his father

767
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,460
with Mr. Takata tomorrow.

768
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:56,421
Yang Yang.

769
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,386
This is Yang Yang.

770
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:20,884
You are going to town tomorrow.

771
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:22,545
Get him some new clothes.

772
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:30,421
Could you ask the Chief

773
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:35,128
if Yang Yang wants to see his father?

774
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,601
Chief

775
00:55:37,601 --> 00:55:38,936
he asks

776
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:40,733
if Yang Yang wants to see his father.

777
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:42,940
No problem.

778
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:46,205
Of course he does.

779
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:50,870
No problem.

780
00:55:51,582 --> 00:55:51,809
Sure?

781
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:53,683
Yes.

782
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,820
One moment.

783
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,419
I have to take a call.

784
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:20,234
This is Rie.

785
00:56:20,978 --> 00:56:24,573
Father, please don't be upset.

786
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:28,676
I've told Ken-ichi

787
00:56:30,454 --> 00:56:32,581
about your trip to China.

788
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:41,491
He didn't say a word the whole night

789
00:56:42,299 --> 00:56:44,494
after he heard this

790
00:56:46,837 --> 00:56:51,706
but he looked different.

791
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:56,506
I could see a change in his eyes.

792
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:00,743
Father

793
00:57:01,685 --> 00:57:04,586
he never expected that

794
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:07,619
you would do such a thing for him.

795
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:11,452
Ken-ichi told me today

796
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:15,490
this particular piece of mask opera

797
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,264
is not that important to him.

798
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:21,699
He was only being polite to Li.

799
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:30,270
So, Father, please come back.

800
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:36,579
Father

801
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:38,612
can you hear me?

802
00:57:41,325 --> 00:57:42,724
I am listening.

803
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:45,684
Father

804
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:48,694
please come home.

805
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,472
Ken-ichi said

806
00:57:58,876 --> 00:58:01,071
your trip to China

807
00:58:02,379 --> 00:58:03,676
is the most wonderful thing

808
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:07,283
you've done for him.

809
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:15,046
Did Ken-ichi say that?

810
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:16,818
Yes

811
00:58:18,796 --> 00:58:22,527
these are his exact words.

812
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:30,300
Thank you.

813
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:35,339
Standing here today

814
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:37,373
I'm not sure

815
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:40,611
if Ken-ichi has uttered these words.

816
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:44,449
If he has

817
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:48,450
it is the first compliment

818
00:58:49,426 --> 00:58:54,864
from my son in many years.

819
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,065
Seeing this large banquet

820
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:01,596
prepared by the villagers

821
00:59:02,773 --> 00:59:04,138
for me a total stranger

822
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:08,941
I am deeply touched.

823
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,777
I will never forget this.

824
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:15,381
The sight of such generosity

825
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:18,484
and kindness from the villagers

826
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:20,914
makes me want to believe

827
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:23,118
that Ken-ichi has said these words.

828
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:18,916
What's wrong?

829
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:19,712
The tractor's broken down.

830
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:21,747
Broken down.

831
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:22,749
Really?

832
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:23,782
Yes

833
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:26,111
Can you fix it?

834
01:00:27,224 --> 01:00:29,658
I think so. Let me try.

835
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,695
Yang Yang!

836
01:01:54,611 --> 01:01:55,703
Yang Yang!

837
01:01:58,582 --> 01:01:59,674
Lingo!

838
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:45,551
Lingo!

839
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,371
Yang Yang! Mr. Takata!

840
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:06,973
Yang Yang!

841
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:11,016
Mr. Takata!

842
01:03:14,091 --> 01:03:15,115
Mr. Takata!

843
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:31,365
Yang Yang.

844
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,178
What's the matter?

845
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:44,780
Why did you run away from us?

846
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:01,637
Do you know your way home?

847
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:03,932
Going home?

848
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:06,707
Your home.

849
01:04:14,151 --> 01:04:15,675
Why are you running away?

850
01:04:24,294 --> 01:04:25,226
Yang Yang.

851
01:04:27,764 --> 01:04:28,856
Do you know where you're going?

852
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:34,462
Yang Yang

853
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:37,795
are you going home?

854
01:04:45,315 --> 01:04:46,373
Is this the right direction?

855
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:58,728
Hurry up everyone!

856
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:19,781
It seems like hours.

857
01:05:20,217 --> 01:05:25,416
All I can do is to follow Yang Yang around.

858
01:05:26,456 --> 01:05:27,388
I'm one step behind. I think

859
01:05:27,824 --> 01:05:31,828
the way I'm chasing after him

860
01:05:31,828 --> 01:05:37,960
is the way I chase after my own son.

861
01:05:41,972 --> 01:05:43,030
I don't know

862
01:05:44,808 --> 01:05:46,833
which path to take

863
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:49,171
or what direction to go.

864
01:05:50,347 --> 01:05:51,939
I have no idea.

865
01:05:57,854 --> 01:05:59,014
Yang Yang.

866
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:04,359
We've been here before.

867
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:08,826
The trail looks the same.

868
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,765
Do you see?

869
01:06:15,238 --> 01:06:16,227
Yang Yang.

870
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:22,569
We are lost.

871
01:06:28,585 --> 01:06:30,018
We are very lost.

872
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:37,022
We can't keep going like this.

873
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:42,494
Let's wait for someone to find us.

874
01:06:50,607 --> 01:06:51,574
All right.

875
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:56,504
Let's find a place to rest.

876
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:16,590
Let's wait here

877
01:07:18,001 --> 01:07:20,970
and stay out of the wind.

878
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:43,582
Yang Yang.

879
01:08:00,143 --> 01:08:01,508
What are you doing?

880
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,345
Having a poo-poo?

881
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:10,514
I thought you were running off again.

882
01:08:12,622 --> 01:08:13,490
Don't look.

883
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:15,925
I can't do it if you watch.

884
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,085
Go away.

885
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:24,462
I don't believe this.

886
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,669
Go away.

887
01:08:29,706 --> 01:08:30,907
Go away.

888
01:08:30,907 --> 01:08:32,976
I'm not leaving.

889
01:08:32,976 --> 01:08:34,273
I'll stay here.

890
01:08:49,926 --> 01:08:51,393
Go away.

891
01:09:08,178 --> 01:09:10,112
Stop doing that!

892
01:09:11,014 --> 01:09:13,380
Stop doing that!

893
01:09:21,758 --> 01:09:23,623
Go away.

894
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,369
Yang Yang.

895
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:35,305
Yang Yang.

896
01:09:35,305 --> 01:09:37,205
Hold on

897
01:09:37,607 --> 01:09:40,276
Let's split into two groups to search.

898
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:42,107
That would be more efficient.

899
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,647
All right, let's do it.

900
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:46,716
Lingo, how do you pronounce his name?

901
01:09:46,716 --> 01:09:47,784
Mr. Takata.

902
01:09:47,784 --> 01:09:49,012
Are you sure?

903
01:09:50,086 --> 01:09:51,354
Of course. It's a simple name.

904
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:53,219
Can you teach everyone to say it?

905
01:09:54,624 --> 01:09:56,493
It's pronounced as Mr. Takata.

906
01:09:56,493 --> 01:09:57,760
Repeat with me.

907
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,091
Mr. Takata.

908
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:00,586
Mr. Takata.

909
01:10:01,331 --> 01:10:02,491
Say it louder. Mr. Takata.

910
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:03,700
Mr. Takata!

911
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,497
All right.

912
01:10:06,169 --> 01:10:08,538
You lead them that way.

913
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:09,630
We'll go this way.

914
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:11,674
Keep yelling out their names.

915
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:13,665
Let's go.

916
01:10:14,444 --> 01:10:15,376
Mr. Takata!

917
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:16,501
Yang Yang!

918
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:32,493
The moon is bright in the sky.

919
01:10:36,132 --> 01:10:38,123
Don't be afraid, Yang Yang.

920
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:42,296
I'm sure they'll find us.

921
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:48,233
We have to get their attention.

922
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,278
They might not see us in here.

923
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:09,127
Lingo!

924
01:11:32,155 --> 01:11:34,749
Here, I've got a boat whistle.

925
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:20,894
Well done.

926
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:23,139
Well done, Yang Yang.

927
01:12:23,139 --> 01:12:25,369
No, you keep it.

928
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,268
Blow it again.

929
01:12:34,784 --> 01:12:35,910
Well done.

930
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:44,753
Well done.

931
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:17,312
Sitting here all night

932
01:14:18,855 --> 01:14:20,948
waiting to be found

933
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:22,882
I'm holding Yang Yang tightly in my arms.

934
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:25,527
I don't remember

935
01:14:26,496 --> 01:14:34,665
if Ken-ichi and l

936
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:38,697
have ever held

937
01:14:39,442 --> 01:14:43,879
each other like this.

938
01:14:49,285 --> 01:14:51,048
Yang Yang

939
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:56,958
has no idea what his father even looks like.

940
01:14:58,928 --> 01:15:00,759
I wonder

941
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:05,967
what kind of father I am to Ken-ichi?

942
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:26,354
His blood pressure is normal.

943
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:28,354
You will be fine.

944
01:15:29,792 --> 01:15:31,327
Thank you.

945
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:32,521
Not at all.

946
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:36,090
I need to check the boy.

947
01:15:38,668 --> 01:15:39,760
Give me your hand.

948
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:50,968
Jasmine

949
01:15:52,682 --> 01:15:54,547
could I talk to the Chief please?

950
01:16:05,094 --> 01:16:06,561
I am sorry for causing all this trouble.

951
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:09,589
No problem.

952
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:12,625
May I ask

953
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:17,598
why Yang Yang ran away yesterday?

954
01:16:21,444 --> 01:16:23,742
He often wanders away.

955
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:31,442
I am not so sure.

956
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:34,045
Shall we ask Yang Yang?

957
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:40,825
Maybe he doesn't want to see his father after all.

958
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:47,803
There is no need to ask.

959
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:49,005
We'll make the decision for him.

960
01:16:49,005 --> 01:16:50,907
What the hell does a child know?

961
01:16:50,907 --> 01:16:52,966
He has to do as we say.

962
01:16:53,643 --> 01:16:55,975
She can't translate if you're all speaking at once

963
01:16:56,412 --> 01:16:58,614
Shut up. You can't speak Japanese anyway.

964
01:16:58,614 --> 01:16:59,672
I can't? Can you?

965
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:01,410
You know I can't. Neither can you!

966
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:04,078
They're arguing again.

967
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:16,556
We should ask Yang Yang what he wants.

968
01:17:21,037 --> 01:17:22,834
Okay, let me ask him.

969
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:28,699
Yang Yang, come.

970
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:33,237
Sit over here.

971
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:36,110
Let me ask you something.

972
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:40,950
Do you want to meet your dad?

973
01:17:43,693 --> 01:17:45,661
Do you?

974
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:48,459
Come on. Yes or no?

975
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:50,923
No.

976
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:52,268
Why not?

977
01:17:52,268 --> 01:17:53,963
Don't be naughty.

978
01:17:55,104 --> 01:17:56,503
I am not going!

979
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:57,806
Why?

980
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:01,904
Tell me why not?

981
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:06,682
You must do as the adults say.

982
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:09,549
I'm telling you to go.

983
01:18:10,553 --> 01:18:11,487
Go now.

984
01:18:11,487 --> 01:18:12,715
He's not my dad.

985
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:15,491
I've never seen him before.

986
01:18:15,491 --> 01:18:18,016
He is your dad no matter what.

987
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:21,752
I'm not going.

988
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:25,693
Why don't you want to see your dad?

989
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:27,535
I just don't.

990
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:30,232
Why don't you want to see him?

991
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:32,066
He's your dad.

992
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:35,011
Don't be naughty.

993
01:18:35,011 --> 01:18:37,646
Yang Yang doesn't want to go.

994
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:39,546
You must do as we say.

995
01:18:39,982 --> 01:18:41,083
I will not go.

996
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,251
Why not?

997
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:43,183
Tell me.

998
01:18:43,953 --> 01:18:46,183
Could I speak with the Chief?

999
01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:49,683
Chief, could you please come here?

1000
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:55,587
Let's talk over there.

1001
01:18:57,633 --> 01:18:59,328
Don't cry Yang Yang.

1002
01:19:00,036 --> 01:19:01,670
We are not going.

1003
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:02,534
Don't cry.

1004
01:19:12,782 --> 01:19:14,215
Chief

1005
01:19:15,317 --> 01:19:16,284
everyone

1006
01:19:18,888 --> 01:19:20,719
I'm sorry for causing you any trouble.

1007
01:19:22,725 --> 01:19:28,925
I've decided not to take Yang Yang to the prison.

1008
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:31,724
Yang Yang

1009
01:19:35,838 --> 01:19:38,363
might not be ready

1010
01:19:40,643 --> 01:19:43,578
to meet his father yet.

1011
01:19:45,214 --> 01:19:47,239
Although he is just a child

1012
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:52,616
I think we should try to understand

1013
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:58,191
and respect his wishes on this.

1014
01:20:15,945 --> 01:20:17,713
All right.

1015
01:20:17,713 --> 01:20:19,010
Yang Yang will not go.

1016
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:32,388
Who will raise Yang Yang now?

1017
01:20:35,264 --> 01:20:36,699
Tell him not to worry.

1018
01:20:36,699 --> 01:20:38,291
The village will keep caring for Yang Yang.

1019
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:41,235
Li will be released in 2 years.

1020
01:20:41,871 --> 01:20:44,173
We'll arrange a meeting then.

1021
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:46,664
The boy will be united with his dad.

1022
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:48,901
We will take care of it.

1023
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:21,673
Jasmine, one moment.

1024
01:23:57,232 --> 01:23:59,097
Yang Yang!

1025
01:24:26,962 --> 01:24:27,963
Mr. Takata

1026
01:24:27,963 --> 01:24:29,988
what do you want to do now?

1027
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,495
I would like to visit the prison again.

1028
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:37,206
If possible

1029
01:24:37,206 --> 01:24:39,401
I'd still like to film Li's performance.

1030
01:24:42,211 --> 01:24:44,907
Could you contact Warden Chen

1031
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:49,548
to see if Li would be willing?

1032
01:24:50,352 --> 01:24:54,686
You may have to wait a few days for an answer

1033
01:24:58,327 --> 01:24:59,191
I'll wait.

1034
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:01,452
All right.

1035
01:25:29,992 --> 01:25:30,981
Father.

1036
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:35,554
Father

1037
01:25:38,267 --> 01:25:40,997
I've been trying to contact you for hours

1038
01:25:42,504 --> 01:25:45,940
but I couldn't get through.

1039
01:25:50,078 --> 01:25:51,568
Ken-ichi

1040
01:25:56,351 --> 01:25:58,046
passed away

1041
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:04,391
Last night.

1042
01:26:25,614 --> 01:26:27,741
Yesterday during the day

1043
01:26:29,251 --> 01:26:30,582
Ken-ichi

1044
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:34,187
was in high spirits.

1045
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:39,320
He talked about you

1046
01:26:42,097 --> 01:26:45,123
and wanted to write you a letter.

1047
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:51,429
He spoke. I wrote it down.

1048
01:27:02,451 --> 01:27:07,514
I wrote down...every word he said.

1049
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,653
Shall I read it to you?

1050
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:25,231
Do you want to listen to it now?

1051
01:27:29,778 --> 01:27:31,712
Please, read it to me Rie.

1052
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:44,090
What do I want to say?

1053
01:27:45,527 --> 01:27:48,223
What should I say to my father?

1054
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:52,365
I'm asking myself.

1055
01:27:53,435 --> 01:27:56,838
I deeply regret refusing to see you

1056
01:27:56,838 --> 01:27:59,170
when you came to the hospital.

1057
01:28:00,242 --> 01:28:01,709
This feeling of regret

1058
01:28:03,345 --> 01:28:07,338
torments me more than my illness.

1059
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:11,279
I've been blaming you

1060
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:15,280
ever since Mother's death.

1061
01:28:17,092 --> 01:28:19,390
Without any explanation

1062
01:28:20,429 --> 01:28:22,420
you moved away to a remote fishing village.

1063
01:28:25,534 --> 01:28:26,398
I thought then

1064
01:28:27,569 --> 01:28:29,366
you were trying to avoid facing reality.

1065
01:28:30,906 --> 01:28:32,134
To be honest

1066
01:28:33,342 --> 01:28:35,105
I've been trying to escape it as well.

1067
01:28:36,712 --> 01:28:38,737
When you came to the hospital

1068
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:41,176
I couldn't face the distance between us.

1069
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:45,483
People have never understood

1070
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:52,749
my obsession with folk opera.

1071
01:28:53,128 --> 01:28:53,822
I've been drawn to them

1072
01:28:54,763 --> 01:28:56,822
because they mirror my life.

1073
01:28:58,266 --> 01:29:00,496
I've come to realize

1074
01:29:01,536 --> 01:29:02,804
that I'm the actor behind

1075
01:29:02,804 --> 01:29:03,702
the mask.

1076
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:08,336
I've tried to fool myself

1077
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:11,142
and everyone close to me.

1078
01:29:12,581 --> 01:29:13,741
My true feelings

1079
01:29:14,383 --> 01:29:16,351
have eluded me until now.

1080
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:20,613
I have not allowed myself

1081
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:24,617
to acknowledge them.

1082
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:27,692
Father,

1083
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:30,391
it's not the opera that is important.

1084
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:32,867
I now see

1085
01:29:34,336 --> 01:29:35,671
that loved ones

1086
01:29:35,671 --> 01:29:42,235
should not mask their true feelings for one another

1087
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:49,942
I eagerly wait for your return.

1088
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:52,952
Father

1089
01:29:53,355 --> 01:29:55,949
I want us to embrace each other once again.

1090
01:30:54,783 --> 01:30:57,752
Mr. Takata. Lingo.

1091
01:30:58,253 --> 01:30:59,488
Jasmine?

1092
01:30:59,488 --> 01:31:00,689
Hello Warden Chen.

1093
01:31:00,689 --> 01:31:01,781
Mr. Takata.

1094
01:31:01,823 --> 01:31:05,293
I'm sorry that last time

1095
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:07,262
Li couldn't sing.

1096
01:31:07,262 --> 01:31:09,025
I've organized more people this time

1097
01:31:09,698 --> 01:31:11,700
to create a crowd to cheer him on.

1098
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:13,565
I hope it will go well today.

1099
01:31:14,069 --> 01:31:15,263
Li.

1100
01:31:15,437 --> 01:31:16,495
Yes, sir.

1101
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:18,373
Tell Mr. Takata what you want to say.

1102
01:31:18,373 --> 01:31:20,942
Mr. Takata, I'm sorry about last time.

1103
01:31:20,942 --> 01:31:22,432
I'll do my best this time.

1104
01:31:27,349 --> 01:31:28,509
Warden Chen

1105
01:31:30,385 --> 01:31:34,289
thank you for arranging this.

1106
01:31:34,289 --> 01:31:36,280
It's very kind of you.

1107
01:31:37,058 --> 01:31:38,787
Today, however

1108
01:31:40,095 --> 01:31:41,858
I am not here to film the opera.

1109
01:31:43,565 --> 01:31:45,362
I've waited for two days

1110
01:31:46,935 --> 01:31:49,335
just to meet Mr. Li.

1111
01:31:50,305 --> 01:31:53,001
May I have a few words with him?

1112
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:08,985
Of course.

1113
01:32:17,432 --> 01:32:18,797
Mr. Li

1114
01:32:21,603 --> 01:32:23,366
I've been to Stone Village.

1115
01:32:32,414 --> 01:32:33,847
I've met Yang Yang.

1116
01:32:42,858 --> 01:32:44,689
You saw Yang Yang?

1117
01:32:55,570 --> 01:33:00,564
He is a good boy. He really is.

1118
01:33:19,761 --> 01:33:20,785
Warden Chen

1119
01:33:21,062 --> 01:33:23,465
I've taken some photos of his son.

1120
01:33:23,465 --> 01:33:24,693
May I show him?

1121
01:33:28,503 --> 01:33:29,561
What photos?

1122
01:33:32,674 --> 01:33:35,472
Photos of his son and the village.

1123
01:33:39,014 --> 01:33:40,140
Photos of his son?

1124
01:33:41,182 --> 01:33:44,640
Please show us.

1125
01:35:58,286 --> 01:35:59,617
That's all.

1126
01:36:00,555 --> 01:36:03,251
Sorry these are all I have.

1127
01:36:34,722 --> 01:36:35,950
Li

1128
01:36:36,891 --> 01:36:38,359
Mr. Takata traveled a great distance

1129
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:40,691
to take these photos for you.

1130
01:36:41,062 --> 01:36:43,231
Your son is a bright boy.

1131
01:36:43,231 --> 01:36:44,632
Everyone would agree with me.

1132
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:46,293
He is really delightful.

1133
01:36:47,602 --> 01:36:49,194
You should thank Mr. Takata.

1134
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:53,638
Thank you, Mr. Takata.

1135
01:36:57,846 --> 01:36:59,336
Can you perform?

1136
01:37:00,048 --> 01:37:01,140
I'll sing to the best of my ability.

1137
01:37:08,957 --> 01:37:10,891
There is really no need to perform.

1138
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:13,725
I didn't come to film the opera today.

1139
01:37:18,266 --> 01:37:19,096
Mr. Takata

1140
01:37:19,934 --> 01:37:21,369
I've arranged the band

1141
01:37:21,369 --> 01:37:22,704
and the crowd.

1142
01:37:22,704 --> 01:37:24,239
A lot of men in our region

1143
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:26,107
can sing mask opera.

1144
01:37:26,107 --> 01:37:28,309
I've picked some good ones

1145
01:37:28,309 --> 01:37:29,310
to accompany him.

1146
01:37:29,310 --> 01:37:31,778
I hope you stay for the opera.

1147
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:42,015
There's really no need for me to film it.

1148
01:37:44,826 --> 01:37:46,060
Let me put it this way.

1149
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:47,925
You don't have to film it.

1150
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:50,254
We invite you to be our audience.

1151
01:37:50,832 --> 01:37:53,101
We'll perform the opera.

1152
01:37:53,101 --> 01:37:55,467
Please, will you sit here and watch?

1153
01:38:43,952 --> 01:38:45,510
Mr. Takata

1154
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:47,112
thank you.

1155
01:38:47,822 --> 01:38:49,187
You are a very kind man.

1156
01:38:51,159 --> 01:38:54,253
So is your son, Ken-ichi.

1157
01:38:55,029 --> 01:38:56,360
I'll perform well.

1158
01:38:57,365 --> 01:39:00,095
Please film my performance

1159
01:39:01,302 --> 01:39:04,271
and show it to Ken-ichi.

1160
01:39:04,305 --> 01:39:06,341
Please tell him

1161
01:39:06,341 --> 01:39:09,139
to visit us again.

1162
01:39:29,864 --> 01:39:31,092
Mr. Li

1163
01:39:33,401 --> 01:39:34,766
I will film your performance.

1164
01:39:40,308 --> 01:39:42,469
Ken-ichi would be very pleased.

1165
01:39:50,952 --> 01:39:52,385
Thank you, Mr. Takata.
