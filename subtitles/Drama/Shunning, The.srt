1
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,235
What do you
think you're doing?

2
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,735
Benjamin.

3
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,569
Don't bother explaining,
Katie.

4
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,705
Just be thankful it was me
that heard you up here.

5
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,299
Not <i>Mam</i> or <i>Dat</i>.

6
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,677
I just wanted to
hear it one more time.

7
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,209
This isn't how
you want to start

8
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,644
your new life with
the Bishop, is it?

9
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,150
Sneaking around.
Keeping secrets.

10
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,684
Now, you'd best go
help <i>Mam</i> with supper

11
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,289
so they don't
wonder where ya are.

12
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,917
Got the first 10
acres harvested today.

13
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:11,121
Lord willing, we'll be harnessing up
the hay-mower next week.

14
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,349
We better.

15
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,552
That ol' draft horse is
about to give up the ghost.

16
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,083
Mmm.

17
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,626
Smells like heaven.
<i>Mam</i> must have cooked it.

18
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,493
Benjamin Lapp.

19
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,531
I'd best get to my
own dinner table.

20
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:31,901
See you in the morning, <i>Dat</i>.

21
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,637
Yeah, okay. <i>Gut</i>, Son.

22
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,452
Katie.

23
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:53,824
Before we bless the meal, your <i>mam</i>
and I have something for you.

24
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,362
It's your dowry.

25
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:03,032
We've been saving it up
since you were just a baby.

26
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,672
I'm right proud
of you, Katie.

27
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,870
Not every man's
daughter marries a bishop.

28
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,615
What are me and John Beiler
going to do with all this money?

29
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,981
Maybe build an extra
room onto his house.

30
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:19,381
For all them grandbabies
we pray you'd be bringing us.

31
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,657
We'll be sure to
put it to good use.

32
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,264
Invite the Bishop and his boys
for supper tomorrow.

33
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:31,165
We should all have one more
meal together before the big day.

34
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:46,910
# <i>A cool summer night was spent</i>
<i>watching the fireflies</i>

35
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,113
# <i>dance in</i>
<i>the light of the moon</i>

36
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:56,390
# <i>Who would have guessed</i>
<i>that what we thought was real</i>

37
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,795
# <i>was so fragile</i>
<i>and ended so soon?</i>

38
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,695
# <i>I miss what we had together</i>

39
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:10,273
# <i>Promise each other forever</i>

40
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,431
Whoa!

41
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,034
# <i>Was it a long time ago?</i>

42
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,141
# <i>I don't even know</i>

43
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:21,847
# <i>I barely recognize the places</i>
<i>where we used to go</i>

44
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,219
# <i>I've lost track of time</i>

45
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,417
# <i>It seems like just yesterday</i>

46
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,887
# <i>But you're slipping away</i>

47
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,558
# <i>You're slipping away</i> #

48
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,602
Hello, there, Jacob.

49
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,875
I just finished the milking.

50
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,072
I can see that. Here,
you want me to help you?

51
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,514
No, ma'am. Papa says I'm
big enough to do my own chores.

52
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,108
Papas always
know what's best.

53
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,719
Of course he does.
He's the Bishop.

54
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,256
What were you
singing just now?

55
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,088
Singing? <i>Jah</i>, I heard ya.
It was awful nice.

56
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,428
Oh, 'twas nothing.

57
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,797
I don't remember anything
like that from the hymn book.

58
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,096
Welcome, Katie Lapp!

59
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:15,067
Yeah, it was.
Just a different one, is all.

60
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,573
Hello, Hickory John.

61
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,650
John, help your brother
to the kitchen with his milk.

62
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,220
<i>Dat</i> told me to take it.

63
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,758
I got it.
Give it here.

64
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,260
He told ya to help.
Get the door.

65
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,064
He'll warm to you in time.

66
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:43,464
It's only been a few years
since his mama's passing.

67
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,232
So, what brings you out
so early in the morning?

68
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,798
On my way into town to
clean for the Millers.

69
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,341
My <i>dat</i> wanted me to
come by and invite you

70
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,909
and the boys to
supper this evening.

71
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,777
<i>Jah</i>. <i>Jah</i>. That would be <i>gut</i>.

72
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:00,006
By the way, I want you to
tell those English

73
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:03,416
that it's time for them to start
looking for a new housekeeper.

74
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,453
Once you and I are tied, you'd be
plenty busy with those boys,

75
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,349
not to mention

76
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,251
some of our own, I hope.

77
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,597
See you tonight then?

78
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,128
<i>Jah</i>.

79
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,871
<i>I got ya something</i>.

80
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,920
Where did you get it?

81
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:50,483
When I went to the city last month
to visit my cousins.

82
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,430
Katie Lapp.

83
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,898
You are the most beautiful
creature God ever made.

84
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,247
In a few years,
when we're both old enough,

85
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,285
I'm going to marry you.

86
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,619
Then I'll be sure
to grow up fast.

87
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,418
Help you, ma'am?

88
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,448
Yes, I'm trying
to locate someone.

89
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,549
An Amish woman
named Rebecca.

90
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,088
I'm sorry to say
I don't have her last name.

91
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:03,527
Well, there's more'n 350 souls
in Hickory Hollow.

92
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:06,932
Must be at least a dozen
or more named Rebecca.

93
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,906
It would be a start if you could
point us to where they live.

94
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,606
No, ma'am.
Not without permission.

95
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,612
Please, sir.

96
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,814
It is important
that I find her.

97
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,584
She would have a daughter,
about 20.

98
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,289
Sorry, ma'am.

99
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,962
Thank you, anyway.

100
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,601
It's the same thing in
every one of these little towns.

101
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,004
No one knows anything.

102
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,770
If they do, they're not
willing to say it.

103
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,708
The Amish are
very private people.

104
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,646
You just have to keep knocking
until someone opens up.

105
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,307
What if that
door never opens?

106
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,076
Then I'll crawl
through a window.

107
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,244
Let's stay on this road.

108
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,520
Maybe I'm the problem.

109
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:07,029
I haven't seen another brother within
100 miles of this place.

110
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,043
Couldn't help but
overhear ya in the store.

111
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:26,079
Old as I am, I suppose I know
just about every soul in this county.

112
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,911
The Rebecca I'm looking for
would have a daughter,

113
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,749
born 20 years ago.

114
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,653
Ella Mae Zook!

115
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,150
You have left your
groceries in the basket.

116
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,295
What I was saying was
she would have been born on...

117
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,459
June 5th.

118
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,061
Yes.

119
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:51,637
If you ain't coming back, I'm
gonna put your stuff back on the shelf!

120
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:55,008
Hold your horses,
Ephram Yoder.

121
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,739
I'll be in presently.

122
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:05,019
It would mean everything to me
if you could give this to Rebecca.

123
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,358
Do what I can, child.

124
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,213
Mam, did you ever
love anyone before <i>Dat</i>?

125
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:39,153
Even if I did, I wouldn't
be telling ya now, would I?

126
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,760
The answer is no.

127
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,589
Once your <i>dat</i> sets
his mind to something,

128
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,528
there's no changing it.

129
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:52,299
Well, he set his mind on me
and I'm grateful he did.

130
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,595
I just...

131
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,301
I thought I'd be sewing my
wedding dress for someone else.

132
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,410
I know.

133
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,716
Your days with Daniel,
the memories you made,

134
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,917
they'll always
be a part of you.

135
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:13,616
But you can't build the rest
of your life on memories.

136
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,123
Sorry for interrupting.

137
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,483
Come in, Ella Mae.

138
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,560
I can't stay, child.

139
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:22,997
I was just hoping to have
a word in private, Rebecca.

140
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,509
Ella Mae.

141
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:44,719
Happened to pay a visit to
Ephram Yoder's store this morning.

142
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,888
There was a fancy English
woman there who give me this.

143
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,429
I don't understand.

144
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,797
What made her
give this to you?

145
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,436
What ya say?

146
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,641
She was a determined woman.

147
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:13,212
And I didn't want this letter
to fall into anyone else's hands,

148
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,751
except yours.

149
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,653
Should you need me,
I'll come.

150
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,971
Leave me
to do this, Katie.

151
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,709
Go upstairs and finish stitching
your wedding dress.

152
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,444
I'd rather
be here with you.

153
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,583
No, I insist.

154
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,723
Go on. Right now.

155
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,357
Mama.

156
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,936
You'll be awful busy being
a wife and mother to those boys.

157
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,238
We likely won't
see much of ya,

158
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,240
except for
the Sunday preachings.

159
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,079
Never far away, Mama.

160
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,706
Never far away, Katie.

161
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,696
So, have you chosen
a side-sitter yet?

162
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,035
<i>Jah</i>,

163
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,631
my youngest brother, Noah.

164
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,213
Boys, what do you
think of the shoofly pie?

165
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:53,876
Delicious.

166
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,249
I'm gonna need
another slice right quick.

167
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,916
It's Katie's recipe,
you know.

168
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,751
Our good fortune, then.

169
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:06,294
Katie'll makes us lots of good pies
when she's our <i>mam</i>, won't ya?

170
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:10,797
You'll have to patient with me,
little Jacob. Never been a mama before.

171
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,564
<i>Dat</i>, can we play
checkers after supper?

172
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,597
<i>Jah</i>, Benjamin will
get out the card.

173
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,971
Maybe Katie can
sing to us, too.

174
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,344
The song you were singing today,
from the other hymn book.

175
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:30,910
You must be confused, Son.

176
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:35,320
We only have one
hymn book, the <i>Ausband</i>.

177
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,587
We do not sing
the songs of the English.

178
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,856
That is what sets
our world apart.

179
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,160
All I know is
it's real nice.

180
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,730
Katie, will ya
please sing it?

181
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:49,133
Jacob, that's enough
about the singing.

182
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,669
Finish your pie.

183
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:14,358
Now stop your worrying.
She's a willful child.

184
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,863
But she knows
right from wrong.

185
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,459
It's not that.

186
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,936
An English woman gave this
to Ella Mae Zook to pass along.

187
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,516
I've been too
afraid to open it.

188
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,026
Oh, dear God.

189
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,230
This woman promised
to leave us alone.

190
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,731
We all made a promise.

191
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:03,105
She's staying at
the fancy hotel in the city.

192
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,807
She's not leaving, Samuel.

193
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:10,943
What are we going to do?

194
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,044
Nothing.

195
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:16,858
If we don't respond,
the matter's dead and buried.

196
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,528
No one can find out.

197
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:27,666
If anyone finds out,
it would change everything.

198
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,537
Our whole life here.

199
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:57,954
Guess who?

200
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,360
When I heard that
clacking at my window,

201
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,991
I thought maybe Noah King
was finally coming to call on me.

202
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,729
I thought you were
sweet on Elam Glick.

203
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:07,701
Can't choose between the two.

204
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,534
You're blessed to be marrying
John Beiler, you know?

205
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,372
He's a good man.

206
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:18,180
I just wonder if I'm fit
to be the Bishop's wife.

207
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,681
How can I be the kind
of wife he needs,

208
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,115
the kind of mother
those boys need

209
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,880
when I can't
even control myself?

210
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:23,976
What are you talking about?

211
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,923
Little Jacob overheard me
singing one of my songs today

212
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,954
and told everybody
at supper.

213
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,487
Katie, I thought you
was clean past all that.

214
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,123
I prayed and prayed for God
to take the songs out of my heart,

215
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,667
but I can't
get rid of them.

216
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,360
I don't understand
why he'd put music

217
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:40,960
in your heart and
not let ya sing it.

218
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,804
But it ain't
just the songs. Is it?

219
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:50,179
He understood me, Mary.
Like no one else.

220
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,379
Some mornings I wake up
and look out my window

221
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:59,186
and expect to see him
walking down the road.

222
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:02,188
The river took him, Katie.
It's been three years now!

223
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,157
God called
Daniel Fisher home.

224
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,752
But they never found him.

225
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:10,624
Katie, he's gone.
You have to accept it.

226
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,366
But God has
given you a new man,

227
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,631
a man that any
single gal in this county

228
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,933
would be honored
to call her own.

229
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,238
It's time you
accept that, too.

230
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,365
I got your prescription,
Mrs. Bennett.

231
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,560
I'm fine for now.

232
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,264
Don't you want to
stay ahead of the pain?

233
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,933
Maybe later.

234
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,833
Were there any messages
at the front desk?

235
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,003
None.

236
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,171
Speaking of messages,

237
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:59,476
Mr. Bennett's been starting
to leave them for me every hour.

238
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,476
He's worried.

239
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,042
You've been avoiding
his calls since we got here.

240
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,746
When are you going
to tell him why we're here?

241
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:08,886
I don't know.
Soon, maybe.

242
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,190
Since the Amish don't have phones,
please finish your lunch

243
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,559
and then go back
down and check again

244
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,828
to see if anyone left a message
at the front desk.

245
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,171
Oh!

246
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,238
I might as well
get it over with.

247
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,806
Hi, Dylan.

248
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,110
<i>Laura, thank God.</i>

249
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:36,781
It's been two weeks.

250
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,321
I'm your husband,
I deserve more than

251
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:39,878
a text message
every other day.

252
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,689
I know.

253
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,688
I'm sorry we haven't talked.

254
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,921
No, sorry is "I forgot
to make dinner reservations."

255
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,590
I was seconds from calling out the
National Guard to come look for you.

256
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,964
<i>You're right. We've just been so busy.</i>
With what?

257
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,594
I get that you love the Amish,
but what's so fascinating there

258
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,401
that you can't pick up the phone
and let me know that you're okay?

259
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:58,802
Nothing.

260
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,704
And everything.

261
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:03,676
I don't even know
what that means.

262
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:07,808
But what I do know is that you shouldn't
be traipsing all over the country.

263
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,418
I want you to come home.
You need to be home.

264
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:11,985
I'm not ready yet.

265
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:16,516
I still have something to do
and I can't tell you about it yet.

266
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:20,763
I thought husbands and wives
are supposed to share everything.

267
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,527
I just need you to trust me
for a few more days.

268
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:29,101
And then if you want, you can
come and get me yourself.

269
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,333
All right.

270
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,004
You know I love you.

271
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,212
I love you, too.

272
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,910
We'll talk soon.

273
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,747
I suppose you
know why I came by.

274
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,781
Figuring it had
something to do

275
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,819
with all that
singing business.

276
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:22,722
A confession is
a redemptive thing, Katie.

277
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,828
It's good for the soul.

278
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,536
I guess you already know that
I've been singing English songs.

279
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,533
And I've been
fibbing to my <i>dat</i>, too.

280
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,303
He told me to get
rid of my guitar,

281
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,370
but I've been
playing it in secret.

282
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:53,679
Are you truly sorry
for these transgressions?

283
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:59,120
I suppose I am.

284
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,791
And do you agree
to turn your back

285
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:04,026
on songs not
found in the <i>Ausband</i>?

286
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:06,761
I do.

287
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:14,199
Then, Katie Lapp, today you
have been restored to your faith.

288
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,974
And the church forgives
your indiscretions.

289
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,879
Just as God does.

290
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,046
But there is one more thing.

291
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:29,587
The scripture tells us that

292
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:33,994
"if thine eye offend thee,
ye must pluck it out."

293
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:40,800
I think you know
what you must do.

294
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,268
Destroy the guitar.

295
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:19,907
B chord.

296
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,275
<i>Gut</i>.

297
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,112
And then E.

298
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,241
Excellent. Now F-sharp.

299
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:32,712
And E again.

300
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,053
That's it. You've got it.

301
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:43,955
# <i>A cool summer night was spent</i>
<i>watching the fireflies</i>

302
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:47,598
# <i>dance in</i>
<i>the light of the moon</i> #

303
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:55,878
I'm just not sure if
we should be doing this.

304
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,112
Because the ordinance
say not to?

305
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,814
They say it's prideful.

306
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,081
Well, I suppose
it would be.

307
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,052
If we were trying
to impress the world.

308
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,185
Like rock stars.

309
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:30,077
But what if the music
comes from the heart

310
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,605
and is our way
to please God?

311
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,597
Wait, can we try that again?

312
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,446
What's the matter?

313
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,549
Was the kiss not right?

314
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,946
I can do better if
we practice more.

315
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:22,656
No, the problem was,
that kiss was perfect, Katie.

316
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,433
Everything I had imagined
it would be and more.

317
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,697
Could you ever
leave Hickory Hollow?

318
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,541
You mean move
to another Amish community?

319
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,349
I wouldn't want to live
far away from my family.

320
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,011
Listen to me, Katie Lapp.

321
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:51,818
If anything should
ever happen to me,

322
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,994
I want you to promise me
that you'll keep on singing.

323
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,593
Why are you acting so strange today?
Nothing's gonna happen to ya.

324
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,405
Just promise me.

325
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,505
Okay. I promise.

326
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,939
I'm sorry, Daniel.

327
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,303
I'm so sorry.

328
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,070
So you spoke to
the Bishop then?

329
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:11,335
<i>Jah</i>, confessed.
Like <i>Dat</i> asked me to.

330
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:14,366
It's <i>gut</i> to set
things right, Katie.

331
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,610
Get to the plain truth.
You'll feel better.

332
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,789
<i>Mam</i>, who's Laura Mayfield?

333
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,391
Mama.

334
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,562
You cut yourself.

335
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:46,704
I'm okay.

336
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,410
What happened down there?

337
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,250
She found a scrap of
the letter in the stove.

338
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:05,956
Tea, <i>Mam</i>.

339
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,554
With two sprigs of mint,
just how you like it.

340
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,827
Go see to supper, Katie-girl.
Let your mama rest.

341
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,604
How much did she see?

342
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,904
Just a name.

343
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,674
What if she starts
asking questions?

344
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,554
What do I say?
Nothing.

345
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,686
We say nothing.

346
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,325
For 20 years,

347
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,987
I've been praying this
day would never come.

348
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:42,691
She's been our daughter since
the day we brought her home.

349
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:47,497
I will not allow this English woman
to interfere with our lives.

350
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,145
<i>Mam</i>, whose dress is this?

351
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,786
Where did you get that?

352
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,351
In the attic
with my keepsakes.

353
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,393
There's a name stitched into it.
Katherine Mayfield.

354
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:54,559
Same name that was
on that scrap of letter.

355
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,790
It's an English name.
Ain't so?

356
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,361
Katie, I...

357
00:35:58,422 --> 00:35:59,560
Katie, go.

358
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,194
What are you not telling me?
Go. Go.

359
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,901
Samuel! Time has come.

360
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,345
Katie.

361
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,883
That fancy dress there.

362
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,688
It's yours.

363
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,360
I'm Katherine Mayfield?

364
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,759
<i>Jah</i>, you were.

365
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,760
Please, explain.

366
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,296
Since the day we
laid eyes on you,

367
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,201
we've loved you like our own.

368
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:40,236
What are you saying?

369
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:44,079
We're saying that you
are English by birth,

370
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,706
and you are Amish
by adoption.

371
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,307
I'm not your daughter?

372
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,943
You have always
been our daughter!

373
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:53,951
You just weren't
born to us.

374
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,254
Why didn't you tell me?

375
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:00,386
It would have
made no difference.

376
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:01,953
Yes, it would,
I'm not Amish!

377
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,866
You are Amish
through and through.

378
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,005
The name on the letter.

379
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,742
Laura Mayfield. She's...

380
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:15,903
Yes.

381
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,604
The letter was
from her, wasn't it?

382
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:21,143
What did it say?

383
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:22,343
It don't matter none, Katie!

384
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:25,349
Yes it does, it matters to me!
Why did you burn it?

385
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:28,151
Because some things
are better left unsaid.

386
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,483
All that matters is
we are your family.

387
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,187
But, Dad.
Katie.

388
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,732
Please, trust me on this.

389
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:40,299
You're better off not
digging up old graves.

390
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,138
Does Benjamin know?

391
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,140
No, just the three of us.

392
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:51,009
And that's how we're going
to keep it for everyone's sake.

393
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,473
Not a word about it.

394
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,708
Morning, all.

395
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:10,429
Don't suppose you can
pretend not to have seen this

396
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:13,057
when it shows up
as a wedding gift.

397
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,298
It's for me?

398
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,764
Cow's out of the barn now.

399
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,939
Please,
pour yourself some tea.

400
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,014
What's weighing
on you, Katie-girl?

401
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,383
Last time you stopped by
unannounced was three years ago.

402
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,192
Talking to you lifted
my spirits, Ella Mae.

403
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,459
The only thing that
got me through some days.

404
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,693
Well, I still
have ears to hear.

405
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,639
That envelop you
give <i>Mam</i> the other day.

406
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,235
May I ask how
you come by it?

407
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,685
You and your
folks have a talk?

408
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:09,081
<i>Jah</i>, they told me
about the English woman.

409
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,587
But they wouldn't tell me
what the letter said.

410
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:18,066
Plainly, it weren't meant
for my eyes or yours.

411
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,862
All I know

412
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:26,565
is that I was the baby catcher
in this community for 50 years.

413
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,776
Of all those
hundreds of babies,

414
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,442
only one I didn't catch.

415
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,376
Me?

416
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,448
Your folks brought
you home all bundled up

417
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,616
from the hospital
in Lancaster.

418
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,120
Why do you think
she gave me away?

419
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:52,964
Perhaps the better question
is why has she come back?

420
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,165
My folks won't say.

421
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:58,400
Maybe they're doing
what's best for you.

422
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,209
They kept it a secret
from me my whole life.

423
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:02,801
How is that
what's best for me?

424
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,607
Don't be so quick to judge.

425
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:09,250
You don't have all
the puzzle pieces.

426
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,217
But don't I deserve to?

427
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:15,080
What if I was supposed to have
a whole other life, Ella Mae?

428
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,622
Out there,
among the English.

429
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:21,185
Oh, I won't deny this
is powerful news.

430
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:25,030
But no matter
where God puts us,

431
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,170
it's up to us how
we choose to live.

432
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,023
Can I help you?

433
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:27,321
I want to look like you.

434
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,360
Excuse me?

435
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:34,393
I mean, I would like to dress
in something like you are wearing.

436
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,532
Not like this.

437
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:40,668
Okay. All right, then. Yeah.

438
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:06,131
Trust me.
You were born to wear these.

439
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:13,056
God has said, "It's not
good that man should be alone.

440
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:18,223
"Let us make him
a partner like himself."

441
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,235
And for this reason,

442
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:25,899
a man should leave
his father and mother

443
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,067
and be joined to his wife.

444
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,477
And the two shall
become one flesh.

445
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,747
So,

446
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:40,013
we stand here today
to join this couple,

447
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:45,858
John Beiler with Katie Lapp,
in the eyes of the Lord.

448
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,929
If there's a soul present

449
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:54,435
who could give cause why
these two should not be united,

450
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,562
let them speak now,

451
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:03,438
for after this, not one complaint
should be heard.

452
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:10,115
If there be no objections

453
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,850
and our sister
and brother agree...

454
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:17,815
I... I...

455
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:23,129
I'm so sorry, John Beiler.

456
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,234
I cannot marry you.

457
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,667
I'm so sorry.

458
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:54,256
Katie, are you in here?

459
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:02,030
Katie!

460
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:08,832
Katie, are you out here?
Please, answer me!

461
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:14,646
I'm not angry with you!
I just want to know you're okay!

462
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:18,751
Katie!

463
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:20,515
Katie!

464
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:38,201
Katie! Where have you been?

465
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,771
Have you any idea
of what you've done?

466
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:47,742
What will the people
think of us now?

467
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,784
Your conduct today has put
shame on this entire family.

468
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,212
I don't expect
you to understand.

469
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:56,815
But I did John
a favor today.

470
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,292
What you did was
leave a widower

471
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,828
with no wife and no
mother for his boys!

472
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,794
John thought he was marrying
a good Amish woman.

473
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,094
But that's not what I am.

474
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:06,800
Is it?
Daughter.

475
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,502
Don't let your willful
spirit get you shunned.

476
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:16,768
Benjamin, take little Eli.
Go home to your family.

477
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:32,649
Katie.

478
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,161
You are to go to
the Bishop tomorrow.

479
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,191
You are to repent for what you did
and beg him to take you back.

480
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:43,060
If he will still have you.

481
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:47,534
I will not. I will not
obey you in this, Papa.

482
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:50,671
All my life, I trusted you
to know what's best for me.

483
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:52,042
But you never
trusted me enough

484
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:53,376
to tell me
the truth about myself!

485
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,951
I have a right to know
what that letter said.

486
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,748
I demand you tell
me what it said!

487
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,118
You demand?

488
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:04,556
You speak to me with respect,
you hear me? I'm your father!

489
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:05,821
You are not my father!

490
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:35,880
Oh, Katie.

491
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,219
She's here.

492
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:27,236
Thank you for coming.
Please, won't you sit down?

493
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:31,171
We made a promise to each other
all those years ago.

494
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:35,876
We took her and
raised her as our own.

495
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:39,113
And you were never to
come looking for her.

496
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,453
I know,
but things changed.

497
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:44,449
Not for us.

498
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:48,254
For her own sake,
we never told her about you.

499
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:52,225
But you coming here,
sending letters,

500
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:54,627
snooping around,

501
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:57,402
forced us to tell her
about you.

502
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:01,406
I am so sorry.

503
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:03,773
I just wanted to
meet with Katherine.

504
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:04,869
Katie.

505
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,106
Katie. I just...

506
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:10,648
I just wanted to see
her for a few moments.

507
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:13,815
You may think that I'm naive.

508
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:17,015
But I know what you want.

509
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,956
You want to take her from us.

510
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:22,691
No.

511
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,730
I would never do that.

512
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,825
If that's true,

513
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,096
write another letter.

514
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:32,596
Another letter?

515
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:35,165
One that says you're
sorry for coming here,

516
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:36,970
for trying to see us.

517
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:40,444
And that once you got here,
you realized that it was all

518
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:44,986
a foolish mistake, that you
lost your heart to see Katie.

519
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:48,088
And that you're going home,
never to return.

520
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,115
I could never
write those things.

521
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:55,825
You would if you wanted
what's best for Katie.

522
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:59,234
Not what's best for you.

523
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:02,763
But I couldn't
say what isn't true.

524
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:08,635
Then we have nothing more
to say to one another.

525
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,166
I've come to you
seeking counsel.

526
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:37,129
I'm at my wits'
end with the girl.

527
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,267
We sympathize, Samuel Lapp.

528
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,942
It's a good thing you want to bring
some order back to your household.

529
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,516
It looks to me
as if the poor lamb

530
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,177
has just lost her way.

531
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:55,484
Let us not forget,

532
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:58,617
our Lord left
the 99 to go and bring

533
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:01,686
the one lost sheep
back to the fold.

534
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:06,898
True, Ephram, but what if all
this ruefulness

535
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:10,905
is evidence that she wants
to run from the flock?

536
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:12,472
Leave the people behind.

537
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:19,511
Samuel, this is the question
only you can answer.

538
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:24,945
Are you fearful she's on the
brink of leaving the church?

539
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,947
I pray to God
it's not the case.

540
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:34,590
But I can't promise
that it ain't in her mind.

541
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,134
Then the scripture
is clear on that.

542
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,539
If she will not
listen to admonishment,

543
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,441
then for her own good,

544
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,207
she has to be disciplined.

545
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,183
"With such a one,
you shall not even eat!"

546
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,381
Bishop John,

547
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:10,090
as grievous as this is, as our shepherd,
this matter now falls to you.

548
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:32,715
John.

549
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:37,218
I was planning
to come see you,

550
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,228
but I didn't want to upset the boys
any more than I already had.

551
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,628
Were you planning
to make a confession?

552
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:49,727
No.

553
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,938
This confirms it then.

554
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:02,013
You are drifting
away from the people.

555
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,551
As of today,

556
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,087
you are shunned.

557
00:54:12,088 --> 00:54:13,691
None of us in Hickory Hollow
can speak to you.

558
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:15,788
You may not eat at the same table
with other church members

559
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:19,299
nor do business with any
plain soul until such time

560
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:21,631
that you come to your senses

561
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:25,801
and we see that your actions
meet with your convictions.

562
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:27,999
Then you may be able
to offer a kneeling

563
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:29,701
confession before
the congregation.

564
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:35,247
And it is only then
<i>die Meinding</i> can be lifted,

565
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,914
even if it takes
the rest of your life.

566
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:01,032
Mama, why is Katie
sitting at the kids' table?

567
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:04,200
Just eat your food.

568
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,802
Did you run into Abe Stoltzfus
at the farmers' market today?

569
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:09,933
No.

570
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:13,879
He was going to give you some
medicine to deliver to Ella Mae.

571
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:15,608
What's the matter
with Ella Mae?

572
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,522
Must be the
old girl's arthritis.

573
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:23,455
Acts up with
the change of seasons.

574
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:26,892
I'll go by tomorrow,
take it to her.

575
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,060
Or you could let
me take it to her.

576
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:35,930
Horses need
their supper, too.

577
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,732
I'll help.

578
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:28,308
Ephram, please.
You don't have to say nothing.

579
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:30,817
Just let me buy
the thread I need.

580
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:48,084
I've always been able to
help her when she's suffering.

581
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:51,224
And now there's
not a thing I can do.

582
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:55,335
I can't speak to her.
I can't hold her hand.

583
00:59:57,894 --> 01:00:02,274
I know I've been hard on the girl.
Have been all her life.

584
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:05,445
Give her some time.

585
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:08,345
She'll come to her senses,
do a kneeling confession.

586
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:10,543
All will be well again.

587
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:13,410
It's what
the shunning's meant for.

588
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,022
You'll see.

589
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,596
But this pain, Samuel?

590
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:31,698
Is this God's
way of showing us

591
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:34,605
what Laura Mayfield
has felt all these years?

592
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:37,870
Just wanted to be
close to her child,

593
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,971
just to see her one time,

594
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:44,885
but having a wall
separating her.

595
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,728
She has no respect at all.

596
01:02:33,783 --> 01:02:35,456
I'm not trying to
be disrespectful.

597
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:36,588
It's the only way to
get your attention.

598
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:38,529
We've given her every opportunity.
How does she repay us?

599
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:39,725
Please, <i>Dat</i>, talk to me.

600
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:40,824
Samuel, please!

601
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:43,693
She brings this English
instrument into our home!

602
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:45,795
<i>Dat</i>, please talk to me!
I don't know what to do.

603
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:48,306
I need my papa's help
to help me to know what to do!

604
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:49,565
Samuel,
maybe we could just...

605
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:50,633
What?

606
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,236
We could what?

607
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:54,008
You want to defy the order?
No.

608
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,980
You want to walk away
from everything we believe in?

609
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:57,039
No.

610
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,551
Everything that
sets our world apart?

611
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:00,085
Please, talk to me.

612
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:07,417
No!

613
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:47,497
Talk to me,
please. I need you.

614
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:51,329
Remember the fireflies?

615
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:57,637
They were everywhere,
weren't they?

616
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,474
Shining all around us
as I took you home in my buggy

617
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:03,210
on this very road.

618
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:08,083
The night we first
fell for each other.

619
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:11,048
Everything was perfect.

620
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:13,890
Everything was right.

621
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:19,095
The people have always
been there for me, Daniel.

622
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:22,568
When you drowned, they gave me
the strength to go on.

623
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,763
Now I've lost them, too.

624
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:30,702
Is this what my
faith has been about,

625
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:32,439
being banned for
the rest of my life?

626
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:34,377
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

627
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:37,716
Then maybe it's
time you find out.

628
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:40,745
The only people
who know the truth

629
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:43,256
about my birth
are <i>Mam</i> and <i>Dat</i>.

630
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,459
And even if they wanted to,

631
01:04:45,514 --> 01:04:47,425
they can't tell me anymore
because I'm shunned.

632
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,698
I don't have anyone left.

633
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:53,289
Is that true?

634
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,397
You mean her?

635
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,937
But I don't even
know who she is.

636
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:04,868
I don't know how I
would even find her.

637
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:07,778
Deep down,

638
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:11,342
you know what you
need to do, Katie.

639
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,786
Why did you have
to leave me, Daniel?

640
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:42,377
Mrs. Lapp?

641
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:45,976
Hello, I was hoping
to see Mrs. Bennett again.

642
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:48,215
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're too late. She's gone.

643
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,323
- Gone? But she said she was...
- Jessica.

644
01:05:51,314 --> 01:05:53,351
Out front. Your flight
leaves in 90 minutes.

645
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,160
I'll be right there.

646
01:05:58,854 --> 01:06:01,528
Can you give
this to her for me?

647
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:04,905
I suppose so.

648
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:09,075
I really have to go.

649
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:11,174
She left so suddenly.

650
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:13,511
Her husband arranged
for an air ambulance

651
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:15,412
to fly her back
to her doctors.

652
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,408
She collapsed this morning.

653
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:19,016
Collapsed?

654
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:20,713
You mean she
didn't tell you?

655
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:23,279
Tell me what?

656
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:28,227
Her vitals have stabilized.
BP 90 over 60.

657
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:30,127
She's been in and out of UC
all the flight over here.

658
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:31,426
Laura, can you hear me?

659
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:34,093
What's wrong with her?
Please, tell me what's wrong.

660
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:36,861
Laura, I want you
to look at me.

661
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:39,236
That's very good. Okay.
I love you.

662
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:41,502
Prep her stat,
I'll be right behind you.

663
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,876
The good news is, I don't think
she's had a stroke.

664
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:46,538
But I did warn her
this could happen.

665
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,442
That tumor's pressing
on her spinal cord

666
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:50,142
and interfering with the blood
flow to her brain.

667
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,684
Oh, dear God.

668
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:53,482
We should have done this surgery
a month ago.

669
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:54,577
I know.

670
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:57,589
She kept insisting there was
something she had to do first.

671
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,682
Whatever it is,
I hope it was worth it.

672
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,506
Hello?

673
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:22,307
Yeah.

674
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,616
Yeah, she's doing great.

675
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:27,413
The surgery was a week ago.

676
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:30,891
Yeah, she made it through
with flying colors.

677
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:35,928
Yeah, so about our deal...

678
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:38,994
You went through
a major surgery, honey.

679
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:43,128
It's normal to
feel a little down.

680
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:47,102
We'll have you back on
your feet soon. You'll see.

681
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:51,170
How's she doing today?

682
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:52,337
Singing the blues.

683
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:56,312
We need to give her some space
to heal, so keep it short. Hmm?

684
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:57,646
I understand.

685
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:01,013
I know, but I just need to have
a reasonable rate of return.

686
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,288
Morning, Mrs. Bennett.

687
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,489
What's that?

688
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:10,386
Rebecca.

689
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:13,366
She came by the hotel when I was
leaving and she gave me this for you.

690
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,186
Oh! Oh!

691
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:50,102
Hey, look, I'll have to get back
to you later. Thanks.

692
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,777
Sweetheart, what's that?

693
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:02,914
Could you give
us a few moments?

694
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:30,768
<i>Mam</i>.

695
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:36,208
I want you to know
everything, Katie.

696
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:39,651
It's time you come
to know what happened

697
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:42,086
the night you came
to be our baby girl.

698
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:46,490
But the ban, you shouldn't be
talking to me.

699
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:51,262
I would rather be
shunned myself than have

700
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,630
another minute in
silence with you.

701
01:09:57,059 --> 01:09:59,369
I was eight
months pregnant, Katie.

702
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:05,546
We loved your brother
more than anything,

703
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:09,204
but your <i>dat</i> and me
had been praying for more children.

704
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:12,613
And God answered our prayers.

705
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:16,316
Just not in
the way we expected.

706
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,522
<i>There was a time</i>

707
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:23,226
before my inheritance
that you don't know about.

708
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:28,798
And it's the reason that I
went to Lancaster County.

709
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:34,905
<i>My mom was an alcoholic</i>
<i>and a drug addict.</i>

710
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:38,009
<i>And my grandmother</i>
<i>disinherited her.</i>

711
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:41,844
<i>And when I was 16,</i>
<i>I met this boy</i>

712
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,679
<i>who made me feel</i>
<i>like I mattered.</i>

713
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:48,480
<i>And with no one</i>
<i>really watching over me,</i>

714
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,020
<i>things happened.</i>

715
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:05,901
After Ben was born,
we tried having more babies.

716
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:11,769
I got pregnant three
times and lost each one.

717
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:15,438
I wasn't taking
chances with this baby.

718
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:19,452
I was going to
fight for this one.

719
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:24,187
<i>But the baby</i>
<i>started coming too early.</i>

720
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:27,459
<i>Your</i> dat <i>wanted</i>
<i>to fetch Ella Mae,</i>

721
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:29,860
<i>but I knew</i>
<i>something was wrong.</i>

722
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:35,025
<i>I just knew I</i>
<i>needed an English doctor.</i>

723
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:41,898
<i>I begged and begged</i>
<i>him not to leave me.</i>

724
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:44,034
<i>But he did.</i>

725
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,073
<i>He did leave me.</i>

726
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:50,283
<i>Our precious</i>
<i>baby girl was born,</i>

727
01:11:50,406 --> 01:11:53,353
<i>but something was</i>
<i>wrong with her heart.</i>

728
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:56,520
<i>There was</i>
<i>nothing they could do.</i>

729
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:59,820
<i>She lived</i>
<i>only a few minutes.</i>

730
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:12,703
<i>The doctors said my child-bearing</i>
<i>days were over.</i>

731
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:17,106
<i>Said we'd never again hold</i>
<i>a little one of our own.</i>

732
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:29,254
<i>I remember sitting in the</i>
<i>wheelchair wondering what I was gonna do,</i>

733
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:32,425
<i>when I saw...</i>

734
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:57,742
<i>That's when</i>
<i>she came to us.</i>

735
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:01,922
<i>She was no more than 16.</i>

736
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:06,483
<i>She wanted you to</i>
<i>have a good life,</i>

737
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:11,287
<i>the kind of life she didn't think</i>
<i>she could provide at the time.</i>

738
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:15,658
<i>She offered you</i>
<i>to us in secret</i>

739
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,628
<i>when no one was watching.</i>

740
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:53,562
That buggy driving away was
the last I ever saw of her.

741
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:56,376
All that searching
and you didn't get to see her?

742
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,277
No.

743
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:03,644
I realized that's
the greatest gift

744
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:05,912
a mother could ever
give her daughter,

745
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:10,885
putting her needs
before her own.

746
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:27,462
<i>All anyone knew was</i>
<i>that we left the Hollow pregnant</i>

747
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:31,642
<i>and we returned with</i>
<i>a beautiful baby girl.</i>

748
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:21,524
Why did you keep it a secret?

749
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:25,088
Because we loved you
so much.

750
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:29,631
We were afraid
if anybody knew,

751
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:37,876
that some people would come
and try to take you away.

752
01:15:37,877 --> 01:15:38,941
And that's a risk
we were never willing to take.

753
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:42,141
It mightn't have been legal
in the English's eyes.

754
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:47,448
But we knew in our hearts,
it was legal in God's.

755
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:53,086
You were a gift to us.

756
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:55,858
Straight from heaven.

757
01:15:57,686 --> 01:16:01,828
But I now see you
were a gift to her, too.

758
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:06,029
She just realized it
too late.

759
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:09,008
Where is she now?

760
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:10,202
She went back home.

761
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:12,503
To New York.

762
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:16,712
There's something else.

763
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:20,515
She's dying, Katie.

764
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,280
And that's why
she came back.

765
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:27,293
She wanted to
meet the daughter

766
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:29,226
she gave away
all those years ago

767
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:34,160
and to ask for
your forgiveness.

768
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:56,852
I know you can't speak to me, but I
was hoping you might just listen.

769
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:02,121
You're just
in time for tea.

770
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:29,220
Thank you for talking to me, Ella Mae.
Breaking the ban, I mean.

771
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:33,226
Half the folks
in this community

772
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:35,693
think I'm as
senile as a loon anyway.

773
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:40,232
They'll think I forgot
there even was a ban.

774
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,636
Besides,

775
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:46,434
there are times
the human heart

776
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:49,169
needs more than the
old ways can give it.

777
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:55,241
My <i>mam</i> also talked to me.
She told me everything.

778
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:57,981
Thought she might.

779
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:01,146
The reason Laura Mayfield
came looking for me

780
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:02,984
after all these years is

781
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:06,024
she's dying.

782
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:09,192
She wanted to see me
while there's still time.

783
01:18:12,287 --> 01:18:15,131
Then I guess you've
got a decision to make.

784
01:18:17,225 --> 01:18:20,763
If I don't go now, Ella Mae,
I might never get to see her.

785
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:23,570
I might never find
out who I really am.

786
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:26,978
Who you really are?

787
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:31,047
That's a peculiar
thing to say.

788
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,948
What do you mean?

789
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:35,343
Well, I know who you are.

790
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:38,854
You're that
little girl who loved

791
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:40,757
picking flowers
of every color.

792
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:44,858
Squabbling with
her ornery brother.

793
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:48,532
Listening to her
mama's stories.

794
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:52,335
And always at
her father's feet.

795
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:58,308
Taking late-night buggy rides
with Daniel Fisher.

796
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:03,307
All of that, child.

797
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,911
That's who you are.

798
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:12,682
If you need to go
see Laura Mayfield,

799
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:16,395
then go.

800
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:21,564
Or if you just need
to discover the world,

801
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:25,294
then go.

802
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:28,203
And God be with you.

803
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,104
But don't go thinking you're
gonna find something out there

804
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:34,943
that you ain't
already found right here.

805
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:38,979
The miracle

806
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:43,251
ain't the life
you missed, Katie,

807
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:47,150
it's the life you've got.

808
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:52,932
Twenty years ago,

809
01:19:55,023 --> 01:19:59,199
love brought you
to Hickory Hollow

810
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:04,733
and if you're gonna leave,

811
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:08,212
let it be that same love

812
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,212
that sends you off.

813
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:33,935
When are you leaving?

814
01:20:35,964 --> 01:20:38,877
There's a bus out of
Lancaster later today.

815
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:43,505
You're going to see her then?

816
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:47,813
Yeah. I'm going to try.

817
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:51,121
But even if I don't,

818
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:55,027
I have questions I need answered
for myself out there.

819
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:03,832
If you do find her,
what will you say to her?

820
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,640
I'll say thank you.

821
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:16,346
Maybe she regrets
giving me away,

822
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:19,515
but I'm grateful
that she did.

823
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:24,853
Because she gave me to the best
parents a child could hope for.

824
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:28,455
She gave me
to my true family.

825
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:32,464
How will we know you're
all right out there?

826
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:36,330
I have money saved
up from housekeeping.

827
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:38,466
And I'll write you.

828
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:46,272
Katie, I'm so sorry
if we hurt you.

829
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:49,543
I'm sorry for
all the secrets.

830
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:52,875
Can you forgive me?

831
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:57,219
Mama, I already have.

832
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:06,523
No matter how far you go,
or how long you're gone,

833
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:09,801
we'll always be right here.

834
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:16,070
And when you're ready to come back,
we'll be waiting.

835
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,604
I love you, Mama.

836
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,848
I love you, too, Katie-girl.

837
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:26,614
Never far away.

838
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,346
Never far away.

839
01:23:20,195 --> 01:23:23,574
I suppose if I was
going away on a journey,

840
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:26,942
a little extra
cash might help.

841
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:32,012
<i>Dat</i>.

842
01:23:49,324 --> 01:23:51,804
<i>Attention, passengers</i>
<i>for Buffalo, New York.</i>

843
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,472
<i>All passengers</i>
<i>for Buffalo, New York.</i>

844
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:55,633
<i>The bus will now</i>
<i>begin boarding.</i>

845
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:08,352
Katie!
