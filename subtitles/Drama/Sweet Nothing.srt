00:00:02,452 --> 00:00:04,322
[My Sweet Family]

2
00:00:05,383 --> 00:00:06,383
I'm...

3
00:00:06,483 --> 00:00:07,483
Episode 15

4
00:00:07,753 --> 00:00:10,653
okay with her being more interested
in my money than myself.

5
00:00:11,723 --> 00:00:15,083
I have no problem with her scheming
behind my back with my son.

6
00:00:16,353 --> 00:00:17,883
She's a great lady.

7
00:00:18,653 --> 00:00:21,283
She won't live with an old
man like me for nothing.

8
00:00:22,983 --> 00:00:25,553
Do you know why I haven't
registered our marriage yet?

9
00:00:25,883 --> 00:00:27,283
I was afraid she'd change her mind.

10
00:00:28,183 --> 00:00:29,453
Once it becomes official,

11
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:32,383
she might ask for half of my money.

12
00:00:33,623 --> 00:00:35,253
After thinking about it for days,

13
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:38,553
I had decided to trust her
and register our marriage.

14
00:00:39,553 --> 00:00:41,253
That's what I thought.

15
00:00:41,853 --> 00:00:45,453
But then you fooled around
with her, in my own house!

16
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,553
I'm never going to forgive you.

17
00:00:47,623 --> 00:00:50,383
President! I'm sorry.

18
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:53,353
Burn in everlasting fire.

19
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,083
I'll catch up with you later.

20
00:00:59,183 --> 00:01:00,183
Boss!

21
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:01,353
- Mr Bong! - Boss!

22
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,353
Boss, stop.

23
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:06,083
Mr Bong, are you all right?

24
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,383
What are you doing?

25
00:01:08,453 --> 00:01:09,553
Boss.

26
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,853
Don't do this.

27
00:01:12,723 --> 00:01:14,383
- Move. - No matter what...

28
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:16,853
Mr Bong did,

29
00:01:17,383 --> 00:01:18,983
this isn't the way to handle it.

30
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:21,982
We can't make the movie without him.

31
00:01:21,983 --> 00:01:23,083
Movie?

32
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,383
Isn't this dramatic enough for you?

33
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:27,183
I will finish this movie right now.

34
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,983
- Leave! - Boss!

35
00:01:29,383 --> 00:01:30,753
It's about someone's life.

36
00:01:30,823 --> 00:01:33,553
- I said leave! - Please, grant him mercy.

37
00:01:33,623 --> 00:01:35,083
Didn't you hear me?

38
00:01:35,183 --> 00:01:36,283
I can't leave...

39
00:01:37,553 --> 00:01:38,983
without Mr Bong.

40
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:42,583
Do you want to join him?

41
00:01:45,983 --> 00:01:47,083
You...

42
00:01:47,783 --> 00:01:48,953
deserve to burn...

43
00:01:49,383 --> 00:01:52,483
in everlasting fire, too.

44
00:01:54,183 --> 00:01:55,253
Get them.

45
00:02:12,783 --> 00:02:13,783
President.

46
00:02:14,783 --> 00:02:16,383
Ms Oh, what are you doing here?

47
00:02:18,383 --> 00:02:21,083
I have something to tell you.

48
00:02:26,883 --> 00:02:27,883
I...

49
00:02:28,823 --> 00:02:30,483
I lied to you.

50
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:34,083
Mr Bong didn't use me or
take advantage of me.

51
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:36,983
I...

52
00:02:37,253 --> 00:02:39,193
seduced him.

53
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,083
Ms Oh.

54
00:02:41,383 --> 00:02:42,483
I...

55
00:02:42,753 --> 00:02:43,883
had feelings for...

56
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,083
Mr Bong.

57
00:02:49,653 --> 00:02:51,253
What are you talking about?

58
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:53,883
Why are you talking nonsense?

59
00:02:54,623 --> 00:02:56,083
How dare you threaten...

60
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:58,183
Living with you...

61
00:02:58,623 --> 00:03:00,723
was very difficult...

62
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,383
and boring.

63
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:06,353
I just wanted to marry you...

64
00:03:06,383 --> 00:03:08,483
and live a comfortable life.

65
00:03:08,653 --> 00:03:10,183
That's the only thing that kept me going.

66
00:03:10,283 --> 00:03:12,383
That's when I met Mr Bong.

67
00:03:12,683 --> 00:03:15,083
I knew it would be the end
of me if you found out,

68
00:03:16,483 --> 00:03:18,453
but I couldn't help myself.

69
00:03:18,483 --> 00:03:20,083
I am sorry, President.

70
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:24,753
Ms Oh.

71
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,303
Don't bet your life on something like this.

72
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,653
Tell me now.

73
00:03:31,183 --> 00:03:32,883
I will pretend this never happened.

74
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,983
I will cut my wealth in
half and give it to you.

75
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:37,983
I will let you do...

76
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:40,853
whatever you want.

77
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:42,383
Tell me it's not true.

78
00:03:42,983 --> 00:03:44,383
Tell me it's not true!

79
00:03:44,553 --> 00:03:45,583
President.

80
00:03:45,883 --> 00:03:48,083
I am so sorry, President.

81
00:03:49,783 --> 00:03:52,783
But the person I really love is...

82
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:55,283
not you.

83
00:03:55,983 --> 00:03:57,553
It's Mr Bong.

84
00:03:58,183 --> 00:04:01,183
President. Please spare his life.

85
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:03,383
Please don't kill him.

86
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:05,683
I will take responsibility for everything.

87
00:04:05,783 --> 00:04:08,483
- How... - Please, spare his life.

88
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:09,983
How can you...

89
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,653
How can you say something like that to me?

90
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,383
You know how much I loved you!

91
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,183
Boss!

92
00:04:22,993 --> 00:04:24,583
- Boss! - No!

93
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:26,493
- No! - Stay with me, Boss!

94
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,383
- Boss! Boss! Wake up! - This can't happen.

95
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:30,883
Call an ambulance.

96
00:04:30,993 --> 00:04:33,583
- Yes, Sir. - Boss! Stay with me!

97
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:35,083
- Boss! - No!

98
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:37,683
Boss! Boss! Stay with me!

99
00:04:38,253 --> 00:04:39,383
Boss!

100
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,183
Ki Beom.

101
00:04:47,883 --> 00:04:50,283
What did you do to my dad?

102
00:04:50,383 --> 00:04:51,453
Ki Beom.

103
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,493
Let go and I'll tell you.

104
00:04:53,623 --> 00:04:56,283
Hurry up and tell me what you did!

105
00:04:56,453 --> 00:04:57,453
I...

106
00:04:59,993 --> 00:05:01,283
I am to blame.

107
00:05:03,283 --> 00:05:04,283
What?

108
00:05:07,493 --> 00:05:08,493
I...

109
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:10,673
I am the one who did this to him.

110
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:21,383
Let's talk in private.

111
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:35,483
What?

112
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:37,883
Ms Oh is in love with Mr Bong?

113
00:05:38,983 --> 00:05:40,283
Is that really true?

114
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,653
Keep it down. We're in a hospital.

115
00:05:44,883 --> 00:05:46,683
Where is Mr Bong, that
useless piece of jerk?

116
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:47,783
Where is he?

117
00:05:47,983 --> 00:05:50,353
Are you going to go beat him
up at a time like this?

118
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,823
Your dad is in surgery. You
need to be here for him.

119
00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:57,483
I didn't know something that hideous
was going on in my own house!

120
00:05:57,783 --> 00:05:58,953
Ki Beom!

121
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:01,183
Gosh.

122
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:04,383
Are you serious?

123
00:06:04,453 --> 00:06:06,453
Gosh, it was crazy.

124
00:06:06,623 --> 00:06:07,983
It was unbelievable.

125
00:06:08,283 --> 00:06:09,753
If it weren't for Tae Soo,

126
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:12,783
Mr Bong would've been long dead.

127
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:14,083
What about President?

128
00:06:14,453 --> 00:06:15,983
He still hasn't woken up?

129
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,383
I heard he's either getting a
surgery or some kind of procedure.

130
00:06:19,483 --> 00:06:20,883
I'm not sure which one.

131
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:24,853
Anyway, you need to fix the truck first.

132
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:27,243
I heard you will start selling
food on that truck tomorrow.

133
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:29,183
Yes. I should fix it.

134
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:35,583
Because of his hypertension,
it seems that...

135
00:06:35,683 --> 00:06:37,183
he went into a state of shock.

136
00:06:37,653 --> 00:06:40,183
He had a ruptured cerebral aneurysm.

137
00:06:40,553 --> 00:06:42,793
But fortunately, he was brought
to our hospital in time.

138
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,483
He only had to undergo a minor surgery.

139
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:48,482
Dr Kim. Will my father be okay?

140
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:51,083
He will be fine once he wakes up, right?

141
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:53,183
We will know for sure...

142
00:06:53,283 --> 00:06:54,753
when he wakes up.

143
00:06:55,183 --> 00:06:57,183
We need to observe him for the time being.

144
00:07:08,753 --> 00:07:10,483
How dare you come in here?

145
00:07:12,553 --> 00:07:15,383
Get out. The sight of you disgusts me.

146
00:07:15,623 --> 00:07:16,653
Ki Beom.

147
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:18,363
I know that I did something terrible.

148
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,253
But...

149
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,753
please let me stay beside him.

150
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:24,883
You got some nerves.

151
00:07:24,983 --> 00:07:26,983
Do you think my dad wants to see your face?

152
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:30,883
Leave while I let you walk out of here.

153
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,982
I'm letting you go only because I
don't want to make things worse.

154
00:07:32,983 --> 00:07:34,623
So get out now!

155
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:36,483
I will go as soon as he wakes up.

156
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,653
Please, Ki Beom.

157
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,283
You really don't get it. Get out.

158
00:07:39,383 --> 00:07:40,583
- Get out. - Ki Beom! Ki Beom!

159
00:07:40,653 --> 00:07:43,183
- Ki Beom, please! - Get out!

160
00:07:43,353 --> 00:07:44,683
Ki Beom, please!

161
00:07:44,783 --> 00:07:46,453
Ki Beom! Ki Beom!

162
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,653
Ki Beom!

163
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:52,553
What am I going to do?

164
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:54,883
Please!

165
00:07:58,483 --> 00:07:59,483
Dad.

166
00:07:59,683 --> 00:08:01,283
Wake up.

167
00:08:01,723 --> 00:08:03,883
You didn't know what a
conniving witch she was.

168
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,083
You said she was smart, beautiful,

169
00:08:06,183 --> 00:08:07,753
and elegant. You made such a fuss over her.

170
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:09,753
You loved her with all your heart.

171
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,783
Look at you now.

172
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:15,723
She really fooled you, didn't she?

173
00:08:17,383 --> 00:08:18,383
Get up...

174
00:08:18,553 --> 00:08:22,723
and say something.

175
00:08:24,183 --> 00:08:25,583
Darn it!

176
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,093
You should've waited for me.

177
00:08:41,183 --> 00:08:43,353
Why are you doing all this by yourself?

178
00:08:44,823 --> 00:08:46,353
I heard from Sung Koo.

179
00:08:46,723 --> 00:08:47,883
How is President doing?

180
00:08:49,383 --> 00:08:51,283
He needs to gain his consciousness.

181
00:08:51,883 --> 00:08:54,093
Gosh, even so!

182
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:56,983
How could you just leave like that?

183
00:08:57,483 --> 00:08:59,593
You're always getting involved
in other people's business.

184
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:02,093
A person's life was at stake.
What else could I have done?

185
00:09:02,853 --> 00:09:05,183
Honey, I know it's in your nature...

186
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,183
to help people in need.

187
00:09:07,593 --> 00:09:10,783
But what good is that if it makes
things difficult for your family?

188
00:09:12,883 --> 00:09:15,983
Since a person's life was at
stake, I will let this one slide.

189
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:17,523
But I won't let it slide again.

190
00:09:18,283 --> 00:09:20,853
Do you realise what an important
time this is for our family?

191
00:09:22,883 --> 00:09:26,853
I don't want you to get involved
with Choongshim from now on.

192
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:28,943
Thinking about what they
made us go through,

193
00:09:29,183 --> 00:09:31,093
makes me shudder.

194
00:09:31,783 --> 00:09:33,853
- Okay? - Gosh.

195
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:37,883
Don't worry. It won't ever happen again.

196
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:40,883
From now on, I will only
think about the food truck.

197
00:09:41,783 --> 00:09:44,183
From now on, I will only
eat kimchi fried rice.

198
00:09:45,783 --> 00:09:48,263
You really know how to talk
yourself out of things, don't you?

199
00:09:48,983 --> 00:09:50,503
Is there anything I can help you with?

200
00:09:51,093 --> 00:09:52,183
That's right.

201
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:53,883
We need to fix up the truck.

202
00:09:53,983 --> 00:09:55,283
Thanks for remembering,

203
00:09:55,383 --> 00:09:57,023
but while you were saving someone's life,

204
00:09:57,183 --> 00:09:59,483
the children and Sung Koo fixed it up.

205
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:01,183
They did?

206
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:03,983
Do we need to move that?

207
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:07,893
What else do I have to do?

208
00:10:08,383 --> 00:10:10,283
The weather is beautiful today.

209
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:12,343
It would have been nice
if I went and helped you.

210
00:10:12,383 --> 00:10:14,483
- It's all right. You stay here.
- All right.

211
00:10:15,593 --> 00:10:17,473
I hope you make a lot of money, Dad.
Good luck.

212
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,383
You will be rich, my son.

213
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,093
Let me know when you move locations, okay?

214
00:10:23,383 --> 00:10:25,983
Be careful not to catch cold, Mum.
Call me if something happens, Dad.

215
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,483
- Okay. - I'll see you later, Choon Boon.

216
00:10:27,553 --> 00:10:28,593
Goodbye.

217
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:31,593
Here comes Soo Min's Kimchi Fried Rice!

218
00:10:31,683 --> 00:10:33,483
- Let's go! - Let's go!

219
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:37,283
Bye!

220
00:10:39,783 --> 00:10:41,453
Earn a lot of money!

221
00:10:42,093 --> 00:10:45,383
Check on the production company
often and keep an eye on Mr Lee.

222
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:48,283
I'm sure he's still keeping
in touch with that Mr Bong.

223
00:10:48,593 --> 00:10:49,683
- I'll do that. - Okay.

224
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,593
What's that?

225
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:53,683
President of Choongshim Construction.

226
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:55,583
- Show your face. - Come out.

227
00:10:55,683 --> 00:10:58,483
- We want to talk to you. - Come out!

228
00:10:58,983 --> 00:11:01,883
- Let go! - He's the president. Move!

229
00:11:03,883 --> 00:11:05,923
Are you Baek Ki Beom, the president
of Choongshim Construction?

230
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:07,183
Sir, please go upstairs.

231
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:08,783
What is it? What is this all about?

232
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:10,683
I will tell you about it upstairs. Hurry.

233
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:13,183
- Let's talk! - What are you doing?

234
00:11:13,283 --> 00:11:15,983
We're from Manbok Shophouse.
There's something we need to say.

235
00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:18,083
Please, head on up. Security!

236
00:11:18,983 --> 00:11:20,783
- Sir. - We have something to say!

237
00:11:20,853 --> 00:11:23,083
- Mr Baek! Let's talk!
- I have something to tell you!

238
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,983
Manbok Shophouse will be redeveloped?

239
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:27,173
It's my first time hearing about this.

240
00:11:27,383 --> 00:11:29,483
Boss started this project just recently.

241
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:31,983
Why didn't he tell me about it?

242
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,183
He said you were going
through a lot of things.

243
00:11:34,283 --> 00:11:37,083
He said he would let you take
over once it was settled.

244
00:11:39,383 --> 00:11:42,283
- What do those guys want?
- It's about compensation.

245
00:11:42,483 --> 00:11:45,883
They think the compensation was too small.

246
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:49,783
- They already filed a lawsuit.
- They filed a lawsuit?

247
00:11:50,683 --> 00:11:52,783
There are always people like them.

248
00:11:52,853 --> 00:11:55,083
They always get in our way.

249
00:11:55,183 --> 00:11:58,853
I will take over this project.

250
00:11:59,183 --> 00:12:00,783
Bring all the documents related to this.

251
00:12:01,183 --> 00:12:04,583
Why don't we just do it our way?

252
00:12:04,653 --> 00:12:05,883
They are filing lawsuits...

253
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:08,483
because we are being too easy on them.

254
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:12,483
We could take care of this
situation in no time.

255
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,483
You idiot! We're not gangsters.

256
00:12:15,253 --> 00:12:16,983
We are businessmen.

257
00:12:17,883 --> 00:12:19,043
You're not thinking straight.

258
00:12:19,853 --> 00:12:20,883
I am sorry.

259
00:12:21,883 --> 00:12:22,983
Young Il.

260
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,183
Keep a close eye on them
and report back to me.

261
00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:28,173
And arrange a meeting with the lawyer.

262
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:30,093
I'm going to take care of this.

263
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,083
- Do you understand? - Yes, Sir.

264
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:36,583
(Soo Min's Kimchi Fried Rice)

265
00:12:36,653 --> 00:12:40,183
Is it because the weather is cold?
There's no one passing by.

266
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:42,353
It's already 1pm.

267
00:12:42,383 --> 00:12:45,783
If we don't make money during
lunch, we've wasted half a day.

268
00:12:45,883 --> 00:12:48,953
This is why I told you we
should go in front of a school.

269
00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:51,983
They are on vacation. We
won't be making money there.

270
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,983
And they said a dish like this sells
better around office complexes...

271
00:12:55,023 --> 00:12:56,753
because employees miss homemade meals.

272
00:12:56,783 --> 00:12:59,882
Is that right? Then let's
wait a little more.

273
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:00,983
They will come.

274
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,583
- Welcome. - Welcome. What can I get you?

275
00:13:11,883 --> 00:13:12,883
Sir?

276
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:22,083
What's wrong with him? Do you know him?

277
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:23,683
I've never seen him before.

278
00:13:24,283 --> 00:13:26,083
He's a strange one, isn't he?

279
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,183
You can't sell food here.
Do you want to pay a fine?

280
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:32,783
What do we do?

281
00:13:32,883 --> 00:13:34,983
Gosh, this is such a hassle.

282
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:36,903
Show me your identification.

283
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,683
All right. All right.

284
00:13:41,183 --> 00:13:42,383
I'm sorry.

285
00:13:42,483 --> 00:13:45,183
We didn't sell anything today
so please let this go.

286
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,853
You can't sell food here.
We will get complaints.

287
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,283
I am sorry. We will close now. I am sorry.

288
00:13:51,383 --> 00:13:53,183
- Please let it pass. - We are sorry.

289
00:13:53,283 --> 00:13:54,783
- I'm sorry. - Hurry up and leave.

290
00:13:54,883 --> 00:13:57,483
- Okay. - You can't block the street.

291
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,283
We will move now. We didn't
even sell one bowl yet.

292
00:14:01,683 --> 00:14:02,783
Ki Beom.

293
00:14:04,253 --> 00:14:05,783
Your father still hasn't woken up.

294
00:14:06,783 --> 00:14:07,883
Yes.

295
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:13,383
Okay.

296
00:14:16,383 --> 00:14:17,583
Why are you still here?

297
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,583
Although...

298
00:14:20,623 --> 00:14:22,583
I did a terrible thing,

299
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:25,683
I can't leave...

300
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,183
President like that.

301
00:14:29,783 --> 00:14:33,383
I will stay here and repent
my sins until he wakes up.

302
00:14:34,783 --> 00:14:35,983
When he wakes up,

303
00:14:36,883 --> 00:14:38,383
I will quietly disappear.

304
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,364
I can't understand why you're
doing this all of a sudden.

305
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:44,083
When you did something like that,

306
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,883
you must have known that
this day would come.

307
00:14:47,483 --> 00:14:48,583
Do Kyung.

308
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,583
Please, let me meet him once.

309
00:14:51,783 --> 00:14:52,783
Please,

310
00:14:53,383 --> 00:14:54,853
let me meet him one last time.

311
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,683
Meet him in your next life.

312
00:14:58,383 --> 00:15:01,083
Don't let Ki Beom catch you
and put yourself in danger.

313
00:15:01,783 --> 00:15:03,483
You should leave for your own sake.

314
00:15:13,683 --> 00:15:14,683
Goodness.

315
00:15:15,383 --> 00:15:17,083
Why are we having a barbecue party?

316
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,383
For you to work in the cold,
you need to be strong.

317
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:21,983
So you need to eat well.

318
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,983
- I bought these. - Really?

319
00:15:24,653 --> 00:15:27,123
My Soo Min bought meat for us?

320
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:30,253
How can I afford to buy meat when
I get such a small allowance?

321
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:32,982
He bought the meat and I
bought the vegetables.

322
00:15:32,983 --> 00:15:36,483
- Gosh. - Help yourselves!

323
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,853
Of course. My boy is so thoughtful.

324
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,753
Let's eat. Let's eat, Mum.

325
00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:45,583
- Here. - Wow. Here.

326
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:46,783
Let's eat.

327
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:48,583
It looks delicious. Thank you.

328
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:51,882
How many bowls did you sell today?
100 bowls? 200 bowls?

329
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:54,253
Hey, it was just their first day.

330
00:15:56,883 --> 00:15:59,483
Actually, it turned out much
better than we imagined.

331
00:15:59,883 --> 00:16:01,183
Our customers went...

332
00:16:01,283 --> 00:16:03,983
wild about our fried rice. Right, Honey?

333
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,753
Yes, it was very popular.

334
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,253
We will settle down soon.
So don't worry about us.

335
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:12,683
I hope it works out so that you can...

336
00:16:12,783 --> 00:16:16,283
buy me a mink coat and take me abroad, too.

337
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,983
Gosh, Mum.

338
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,082
Should we make a toast?

339
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,982
- Okay. - Okay.

340
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:26,253
To our health.

341
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:28,383
- To our health. - To our health.

342
00:16:28,483 --> 00:16:30,283
Thank you. Thank you for the party.

343
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,483
It's delicious.

344
00:16:36,383 --> 00:16:37,583
What's going on?

345
00:16:37,653 --> 00:16:39,183
- Come on, Dad. - What is it?

346
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:43,283
You should get a massage. Take a seat.

347
00:16:43,483 --> 00:16:45,683
Okay. Thank you, Soo Min.

348
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:46,853
- Goodness. - Here we go.

349
00:16:47,753 --> 00:16:50,583
- I will set it for you. - Gosh.

350
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:53,553
Does that feel good?

351
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:56,983
It feels very good. Goodness.

352
00:16:58,683 --> 00:17:01,853
Soo Min! Why are you being so nice today?

353
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:04,793
- Do you need money? - No, that's not it.

354
00:17:05,293 --> 00:17:06,583
I'm always nice to Mum and Dad.

355
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:10,083
- Right, Dad? - Of course.

356
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:13,383
My kids are the best.

357
00:17:16,183 --> 00:17:19,183
This feels so nice. Gosh.

358
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,183
Are you going over the numbers?

359
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:30,853
Honey. We sold four bowls today.

360
00:17:31,793 --> 00:17:33,483
We were out in the cold the whole day...

361
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,853
and all we earned was 16 dollars.

362
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:39,883
When we deduct expenses, we
won't have anything left.

363
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:43,983
The family's so excited. How
can we go on like this?

364
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,683
Should we lower the price?
Is it too expensive?

365
00:17:47,793 --> 00:17:49,883
But other places charge
five dollars for a bowl.

366
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:53,883
Maybe it doesn't taste good.
Should we change the menu?

367
00:17:53,983 --> 00:17:54,983
Gosh.

368
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,983
I haven't met anyone that
didn't like your cooking.

369
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:00,883
Then what's the problem?

370
00:18:01,683 --> 00:18:04,383
Gosh, this is only the start.

371
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,483
It's not easy to do well from the start.

372
00:18:08,953 --> 00:18:10,483
It will get better.

373
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:13,583
We will sell 10 bowls tomorrow
and 15 bowls the day after.

374
00:18:13,683 --> 00:18:16,483
Then, there will come a day
when we sell 100 bowls a day.

375
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:20,383
Let's not expect too much for now.
We need to look on the bright side.

376
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:26,083
You're right. I just became
anxious all of a sudden.

377
00:18:28,183 --> 00:18:29,293
It's okay.

378
00:18:44,793 --> 00:18:45,793
Ms Oh!

379
00:18:47,883 --> 00:18:51,293
Are you mad? How can you come here?

380
00:18:51,383 --> 00:18:54,183
I couldn't leave without you.

381
00:18:54,253 --> 00:18:55,483
Run away with me.

382
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,683
Let's not do this.

383
00:18:57,883 --> 00:18:58,953
You and I...

384
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:00,483
are already over.

385
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,983
I thought you said you loved me.

386
00:19:06,383 --> 00:19:08,683
You even said so in front of President.

387
00:19:08,953 --> 00:19:10,483
Well, that's...

388
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,683
It was so that I could save you.

389
00:19:15,683 --> 00:19:17,083
Please, don't do this to me.

390
00:19:17,883 --> 00:19:20,683
I have to stay by his side.

391
00:19:20,883 --> 00:19:22,353
You call this staying by his side?

392
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:24,083
You can't even go inside.

393
00:19:24,183 --> 00:19:25,183
Even still,

394
00:19:26,383 --> 00:19:27,853
I can't leave like this.

395
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:30,793
I'll regret it...

396
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:32,683
for the rest of my life.

397
00:19:33,683 --> 00:19:34,883
I feel guilty.

398
00:19:35,353 --> 00:19:37,253
Please, wake up and smell the coffee!

399
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:39,083
You might be in danger.

400
00:19:54,723 --> 00:19:57,453
Did you see that? Ki Beom just passed by.

401
00:19:57,553 --> 00:19:58,723
This is our reality.

402
00:19:58,793 --> 00:20:01,753
If he finds out that we're here,
who knows what will happen.

403
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,982
That's why you should leave right now.

404
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:06,083
Ms Oh!

405
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:08,383
Please, I'm begging you.

406
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:11,083
I'll wait for you...

407
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,753
at the terminal. Meet me at 12pm sharp.

408
00:20:14,383 --> 00:20:16,453
No, don't wait for me.

409
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,293
I won't show up.

410
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:21,083
I'll wait until you do.

411
00:20:21,623 --> 00:20:23,023
I'll wait for you every single day.

412
00:20:31,293 --> 00:20:32,883
Why isn't he waking up?

413
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,583
What if he never wakes up?

414
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:37,883
Don't say that.

415
00:20:38,953 --> 00:20:40,823
The doctor came by earlier...

416
00:20:40,883 --> 00:20:42,553
and said that we need to be patient.

417
00:20:43,653 --> 00:20:44,793
Dad.

418
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,683
Wake up.

419
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,293
You should get back on your feet...

420
00:20:48,383 --> 00:20:50,793
and get revenge on those who betrayed you.

421
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:52,983
Doesn't it make you furious...

422
00:20:53,623 --> 00:20:54,683
to just lie here?

423
00:21:00,183 --> 00:21:01,183
Yes.

424
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:03,253
What?

425
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:05,723
The tenants sent in another petition?

426
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:09,653
Do they want to see me go crazy?

427
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:13,483
All right. I'll be there.

428
00:21:15,823 --> 00:21:17,253
What is it?

429
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:18,983
It's just work.

430
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,823
With your dad sick,

431
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,483
you really need to take the lead
and look after the company.

432
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:28,483
You said that you don't want to be
someone who just holds the title.

433
00:21:29,183 --> 00:21:31,723
You can live up to your title now.

434
00:21:32,353 --> 00:21:33,353
Of course.

435
00:21:33,483 --> 00:21:35,653
That's why I've been trying
to be more responsible...

436
00:21:35,723 --> 00:21:37,083
and focused at work.

437
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,683
You just watch.

438
00:21:38,853 --> 00:21:40,293
I'll show everyone.

439
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:41,553
That's not what I meant.

440
00:21:41,923 --> 00:21:44,483
I'm telling you to rebuild your life.

441
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,823
Forget the past and make an honest living.

442
00:21:48,353 --> 00:21:49,553
Don't forget.

443
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:52,983
This is your chance to show Hyun
Ji what an amazing dad you are.

444
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,483
I got it.

445
00:21:54,883 --> 00:21:57,483
I'll take care of it all.

446
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:58,723
Do Kyung,

447
00:21:58,953 --> 00:22:00,583
you're my wife.

448
00:22:01,183 --> 00:22:02,383
Take charge...

449
00:22:02,683 --> 00:22:04,083
and do what you want to do.

450
00:22:07,383 --> 00:22:08,383
The time has come...

451
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:11,183
for us to spread our wings.

452
00:22:13,353 --> 00:22:14,383
(Soo Min's Kimchi Fried Rice)

453
00:22:14,453 --> 00:22:15,533
- Are you all right? - Yes.

454
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,083
Welcome, welcome.

455
00:22:18,123 --> 00:22:19,523
Do you want some kimchi fried rice?

456
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:23,383
Oh.

457
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:25,583
You were here before, weren't you?

458
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:26,883
What's the problem?

459
00:22:26,983 --> 00:22:29,083
I told you, didn't I?

460
00:22:29,483 --> 00:22:31,183
I didn't believe you, but you were right.

461
00:22:31,723 --> 00:22:34,353
When will you ever stop bothering us?

462
00:22:34,883 --> 00:22:36,553
I'm not sure what you mean.

463
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:38,183
Are you running your own business...

464
00:22:38,253 --> 00:22:40,483
in front of our shops
because we won't leave?

465
00:22:40,553 --> 00:22:42,983
I'm not sure I follow what you say.

466
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:46,653
We know that you are the head
of the gangsters at Choongshim.

467
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:50,753
Excuse me, there must
be a misunderstanding.

468
00:22:50,823 --> 00:22:52,983
My husband has nothing to
do with them any more.

469
00:22:53,253 --> 00:22:55,253
Do you think we'll fall for that?

470
00:22:55,283 --> 00:22:56,653
You don't remember me, do you?

471
00:22:57,083 --> 00:23:00,183
Or did you do this to so many
people that you can't remember?

472
00:23:01,123 --> 00:23:02,283
Do you know me?

473
00:23:02,753 --> 00:23:04,873
- Where did you see me?
- Do you really not remember?

474
00:23:05,553 --> 00:23:06,983
Because of you, my dad...

475
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,083
Stop it.

476
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:09,623
You're wasting your breath.

477
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,883
No matter what you do,

478
00:23:12,383 --> 00:23:14,083
we won't leave Manbok Shophouse.

479
00:23:14,183 --> 00:23:15,483
This is our home.

480
00:23:15,823 --> 00:23:18,683
We won't let you gangsters
steal it away from us.

481
00:23:18,753 --> 00:23:20,083
Let me make myself clear.

482
00:23:20,653 --> 00:23:22,723
I won't let you do that to me again.

483
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,883
Honey, what's going on?

484
00:23:29,883 --> 00:23:31,723
You stay here for now. I'll be right back.

485
00:23:31,783 --> 00:23:33,283
Where are you going? Honey?

486
00:23:33,883 --> 00:23:35,083
Honey!

487
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,853
I need to be on my way soon.

488
00:23:48,283 --> 00:23:49,583
- Take care. - You too.

489
00:24:01,383 --> 00:24:03,483
- Aren't you cold? - I'm fine.

490
00:24:03,553 --> 00:24:04,553
- Hello. - Hello.

491
00:24:04,623 --> 00:24:06,753
- Thanks for the help.
- No problem. We'll get going.

492
00:24:06,823 --> 00:24:07,943
- I'll see you later. - Bye.

493
00:24:08,183 --> 00:24:09,883
- See you. - It's so cold.

494
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:11,383
Why did you wait outside?

495
00:24:11,453 --> 00:24:13,353
- It's fine. - Let's go inside.

496
00:24:14,123 --> 00:24:15,383
Be careful.

497
00:24:25,723 --> 00:24:27,183
Customers don't come out when it's so cold.

498
00:24:27,253 --> 00:24:28,283
I know.

499
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:33,683
(Chul's Snack Bar)

500
00:24:40,683 --> 00:24:42,183
Go inside and stand by the heater.

501
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:43,283
Okay.

502
00:24:49,883 --> 00:24:51,753
- Welcome. - Welcome.

503
00:24:52,683 --> 00:24:53,983
Who's the owner here?

504
00:24:56,483 --> 00:24:59,083
I'm the owner. What's the matter?

505
00:24:59,183 --> 00:25:00,883
I heard you wouldn't take our alcohol...

506
00:25:00,983 --> 00:25:02,583
because you already signed a
contract with another company.

507
00:25:02,983 --> 00:25:05,553
Yes, they offered a better price.

508
00:25:05,623 --> 00:25:06,623
What?

509
00:25:06,683 --> 00:25:07,723
Then,

510
00:25:08,753 --> 00:25:11,823
how much do you think
our protection fee is?

511
00:25:11,983 --> 00:25:14,283
You already ripped us off for years!

512
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:16,383
I think it's enough.

513
00:25:16,453 --> 00:25:17,883
What did you just say?

514
00:25:18,253 --> 00:25:21,383
Watch your language, Mister.

515
00:25:21,483 --> 00:25:23,653
Should I make sure you don't
say such a thing again?

516
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:25,083
Should I?

517
00:25:25,253 --> 00:25:26,283
Please don't do this!

518
00:25:28,183 --> 00:25:29,583
Get off of him.

519
00:25:29,753 --> 00:25:30,883
Dad, are you okay?

520
00:25:30,983 --> 00:25:32,683
I'm fine. Don't call the police.

521
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:39,623
You're the boss here, right?

522
00:25:39,853 --> 00:25:41,583
Please make them stop!

523
00:25:42,683 --> 00:25:44,083
I think it'd be best for you to leave.

524
00:25:44,183 --> 00:25:45,553
Please.

525
00:25:47,283 --> 00:25:48,723
You jerk!

526
00:25:49,453 --> 00:25:50,483
Look here, Kid.

527
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:53,183
You shouldn't talk like
that to your elders.

528
00:25:53,283 --> 00:25:54,883
Don't touch my son!

529
00:25:54,983 --> 00:25:56,123
You asked for this.

530
00:25:57,683 --> 00:25:58,953
Dad!

531
00:25:59,823 --> 00:26:01,083
Are you all right?

532
00:26:02,183 --> 00:26:04,453
Let's make sure this doesn't happen again.

533
00:26:04,483 --> 00:26:05,853
From now on,

534
00:26:06,823 --> 00:26:10,683
you'll only buy alcohol from us.
Do you understand?

535
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:12,383
Yes.

536
00:26:17,553 --> 00:26:18,683
We're done here.

537
00:26:54,623 --> 00:26:55,623
Tae Soo.

538
00:26:56,483 --> 00:26:57,483
Yes.

539
00:26:58,123 --> 00:26:59,383
What did you find out?

540
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:00,583
Choongshim is planning...

541
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:02,783
to redevelop Manbok Shophouse.

542
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:04,553
They're kicking them out...

543
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,723
but are offering a measly
amount of compensation.

544
00:27:06,783 --> 00:27:08,453
No wonder the tenants aren't leaving.

545
00:27:09,283 --> 00:27:12,353
They have filed lawsuits.
It's a big mess right now.

546
00:27:13,453 --> 00:27:14,583
I can't believe...

547
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,183
that you just happened...

548
00:27:16,283 --> 00:27:18,083
to start your business in
front of Manbok Shophouse.

549
00:27:18,183 --> 00:27:19,553
That's why they thought
you had other intentions.

550
00:27:19,983 --> 00:27:20,983
I think...

551
00:27:21,483 --> 00:27:23,383
it'd be best for you to change locations.

552
00:27:27,753 --> 00:27:28,783
Sung Koo.

553
00:27:29,883 --> 00:27:31,353
Do you remember that German bar?

554
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,783
- Which one? - Five years ago,

555
00:27:33,883 --> 00:27:35,553
Dong Pal started an alcohol business...

556
00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:36,883
and tried to steal our customers.

557
00:27:36,983 --> 00:27:38,953
We went to that bar and gave them a scare.

558
00:27:38,983 --> 00:27:40,083
Right!

559
00:27:40,723 --> 00:27:42,003
The German bar? Yes, I remember.

560
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:45,683
That owner's son was a smart one.

561
00:27:46,453 --> 00:27:48,753
I know. That son...

562
00:27:49,483 --> 00:27:52,353
runs a snack bar at Manbok Shophouse.

563
00:27:53,383 --> 00:27:55,083
He's looking after his father.

564
00:27:55,783 --> 00:27:58,753
He looks like he's about a
year or two older than my son.

565
00:27:59,653 --> 00:28:00,723
Back then,

566
00:28:01,383 --> 00:28:03,083
he must have been furious...

567
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,583
that we did that to his dad.

568
00:28:06,383 --> 00:28:09,183
He would have just gotten into
high school five years ago.

569
00:28:09,283 --> 00:28:10,623
He would have been confused...

570
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:12,383
and scared.

571
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:15,083
I'm sure he's still hurting
from what happened then.

572
00:28:17,883 --> 00:28:20,203
But they're about to get kicked
out because of Choongshim.

573
00:28:20,883 --> 00:28:21,883
Come on.

574
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,453
What are you thinking about?

575
00:28:24,883 --> 00:28:26,283
So what do you plan to do about it?

576
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:30,683
After working on the food
truck for a couple days,

577
00:28:31,683 --> 00:28:34,883
I realised how much I've
been ripping others off.

578
00:28:37,623 --> 00:28:40,653
We've been sucking the life
out of people like them.

579
00:28:40,823 --> 00:28:41,883
Goodness.

580
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,083
Well...

581
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:47,383
I understand where you're coming from.

582
00:28:47,883 --> 00:28:51,183
But we have nothing to do
with Choongshim any more.

583
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:53,183
So there's no need to think about that.

584
00:28:53,883 --> 00:28:55,453
We have problems of our own.

585
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,083
What can we do?

586
00:28:58,483 --> 00:28:59,983
You're right.

587
00:29:00,883 --> 00:29:04,283
I have no idea how I ended up here.

588
00:29:07,883 --> 00:29:10,183
Gosh. You're getting drunk.

589
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:14,283
Let's go home now. You
have to work tomorrow.

590
00:29:14,723 --> 00:29:16,283
All right. Let's go.

591
00:29:16,783 --> 00:29:19,083
Get up. Let's go.

592
00:29:19,783 --> 00:29:22,083
Goodness. Let's go.

593
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:28,983
Dad, you're home.

594
00:29:30,183 --> 00:29:33,823
Yes. My handsome son, you're still awake?

595
00:29:34,283 --> 00:29:37,353
- Dad. You drank, didn't you?
- Well, yes...

596
00:29:38,723 --> 00:29:39,823
Drink this.

597
00:29:41,253 --> 00:29:42,283
Thank you.

598
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,823
Mum will scold you again.

599
00:29:49,723 --> 00:29:52,483
Even water tastes sweet and delicious...

600
00:29:52,623 --> 00:29:53,823
when you give it to me.

601
00:29:55,553 --> 00:29:56,673
Dad, you're stressed, right?

602
00:29:58,483 --> 00:29:59,483
What?

603
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:01,883
Dad.

604
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:06,183
I didn't mind it when you
worked at Choongshim,

605
00:30:06,983 --> 00:30:08,623
but I'm proud of you now.

606
00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:12,623
Cheer up.

607
00:30:15,383 --> 00:30:16,483
Okay.

608
00:30:19,483 --> 00:30:21,383
I know what you're trying to tell me.

609
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:25,723
Sleep well.

610
00:30:26,623 --> 00:30:27,823
Okay. You too.

611
00:30:46,823 --> 00:30:49,483
Are you serious? Is business that slow?

612
00:30:50,823 --> 00:30:53,983
Yes. Mum and Dad aren't
telling us anything...

613
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:55,353
because they don't want us to worry.

614
00:30:55,383 --> 00:30:56,723
Goodness. I'm just speechless.

615
00:30:57,553 --> 00:31:00,282
Aunt. Shouldn't we do something to help?

616
00:31:00,283 --> 00:31:01,383
Of course.

617
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:04,623
I have a great idea.

618
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,183
- Sung Koo. You'll help us, right? - Yes.

619
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:13,823
But with what?

620
00:31:13,883 --> 00:31:17,253
Try our kimchi fried rice! It's
the best fried rice in Daejeon.

621
00:31:17,283 --> 00:31:20,723
It's made with homemade kimchi
and rice grown in Korea.

622
00:31:22,283 --> 00:31:23,723
Try our kimchi fried rice!

623
00:31:27,823 --> 00:31:29,823
- Honey. - Yes?

624
00:31:30,783 --> 00:31:33,283
What are you thinking about? Is
there something worrying you?

625
00:31:34,253 --> 00:31:35,883
No, it's nothing.

626
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:40,623
Try our kimchi fried rice!

627
00:31:40,683 --> 00:31:44,383
It's the best kimchi fried
rice in Daejeon. Try it now!

628
00:31:44,483 --> 00:31:46,883
What if we don't sell anything again today?

629
00:31:46,983 --> 00:31:49,783
Goodness. How can it be this slow?

630
00:31:54,723 --> 00:31:57,723
- Hello!
- You guys startled me. What's this?

631
00:31:57,823 --> 00:32:00,283
It's cold today. What are
all of you doing here?

632
00:32:00,353 --> 00:32:02,883
You and Tae Soo don't really
know how things work.

633
00:32:03,723 --> 00:32:04,823
Don't you agree, Mr Radish?

634
00:32:05,683 --> 00:32:09,483
Regardless of how good the food is,
nothing will sell without marketing.

635
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:11,383
Don't you agree, Ms Cabbage?

636
00:32:11,883 --> 00:32:14,383
We're here to help you hit the jackpot!

637
00:32:14,483 --> 00:32:16,253
So what are you going to do?

638
00:32:16,283 --> 00:32:20,083
We're here to spread the
news about your fried rice.

639
00:32:20,283 --> 00:32:22,553
- Experience the homemade taste!
- It's the best kimchi fried rice!

640
00:32:22,623 --> 00:32:24,383
- Kimchi fried rice! - Kimchi fried rice!

641
00:32:24,453 --> 00:32:26,883
- The best kimchi fried rice. - Try it now!

642
00:32:26,983 --> 00:32:28,953
- Try our kimchi fried rice.
- Kimchi fried rice.

643
00:32:28,983 --> 00:32:31,623
- I'd like three to go. - Thank you.

644
00:32:31,723 --> 00:32:33,083
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Kimchi fried rice!

645
00:32:33,183 --> 00:32:36,883
- Try our kimchi fried rice!
- Kimchi fried rice!

646
00:32:36,983 --> 00:32:39,082
- Kimchi fried rice! - I hope you enjoy it!

647
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,183
- Thank you for waiting.
- It will be a few minutes.

648
00:32:41,283 --> 00:32:43,403
Come to Soo Min's Kimchi
Fried Rice and experience...

649
00:32:43,453 --> 00:32:46,483
the most delicious kimchi
fried rice in Korea.

650
00:32:47,723 --> 00:32:49,083
You and me.

651
00:32:49,883 --> 00:32:52,083
The two of us.

652
00:32:53,483 --> 00:32:54,883
What happened to us?

653
00:32:56,383 --> 00:32:58,083
Things got tangled up,

654
00:32:58,553 --> 00:33:00,683
and everything is a mess now.

655
00:33:02,283 --> 00:33:04,823
I think about how cold you were...

656
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:05,983
and I once again...

657
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:15,083
Gosh.

658
00:33:16,983 --> 00:33:19,183
Am I writing lyrics or a diary?

659
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,523
Baek Hyun Ji, what's wrong with you?

660
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:23,823
You're acting so immature
about getting dumped.

661
00:33:27,383 --> 00:33:28,823
(Yoon Soo Min)

662
00:33:32,383 --> 00:33:33,383
What's this?

663
00:33:34,883 --> 00:33:36,823
Hi, Hyun Ji. It's me, Soo Min.

664
00:33:36,883 --> 00:33:38,983
Hi, Soo Min. What's up?

665
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:42,373
Come and try my parents' kimchi
fried rice at their food truck.

666
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:44,183
Food truck?

667
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,953
I know you have tons of followers.

668
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:51,383
Please promote Soo Min's Kimchi Fried Rice.

669
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:54,383
That's right! Your boyfriend is here now.

670
00:33:59,483 --> 00:34:02,723
Come to Soo Min's Kimchi Fried Rice.

671
00:34:02,783 --> 00:34:04,723
Come to Soo Min's Kimchi Fried Rice.

672
00:34:04,823 --> 00:34:07,083
Try the kimchi fried rice.
It's very delicious.

673
00:34:07,193 --> 00:34:08,713
Come to Soo Min's Kimchi Fried Rice...

674
00:34:12,123 --> 00:34:13,783
Give me some. I'll help you.

675
00:34:15,483 --> 00:34:16,983
Gosh, seriously.

676
00:34:17,693 --> 00:34:19,253
I'll use my looks to promote your food.

677
00:34:19,383 --> 00:34:21,483
- Give me some.
- It's okay. I'm almost done.

678
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:26,553
Wait. I don't want to
be immature about this.

679
00:34:26,623 --> 00:34:29,623
But I need to know why you dumped me.

680
00:34:29,853 --> 00:34:30,883
Why did you?

681
00:34:32,783 --> 00:34:35,883
I already told you. I want
to focus on studying.

682
00:34:37,453 --> 00:34:40,383
Do you think I'll believe that?

683
00:34:41,453 --> 00:34:44,083
Your dad left Choongshim and
does a food truck business.

684
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,483
I know that it had something
to do with my dad.

685
00:34:48,383 --> 00:34:50,883
But that's what happened
between our parents.

686
00:34:51,283 --> 00:34:52,383
Not us.

687
00:34:53,283 --> 00:34:54,483
You didn't have to do this.

688
00:34:56,283 --> 00:34:57,483
I'm begging you.

689
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:01,983
Stop showing up like this and
stop making me feel miserable.

690
00:35:03,823 --> 00:35:04,823
Please.

691
00:35:16,693 --> 00:35:18,583
I went through a lot to
arrange this meeting.

692
00:35:18,653 --> 00:35:20,083
So let's stop being hostile
towards each other.

693
00:35:20,193 --> 00:35:22,193
Let's meet each other half way.

694
00:35:22,283 --> 00:35:23,883
You said you'd listen to our request.

695
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:25,983
Have you changed your mind now?

696
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,483
Now that I've heard what you want,

697
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,353
let's talk about it.

698
00:35:30,883 --> 00:35:34,193
Protests and lawsuits will
just exhaust both parties.

699
00:35:34,283 --> 00:35:36,453
What we want is simple and clear.

700
00:35:36,483 --> 00:35:37,883
We want to be properly compensated...

701
00:35:37,983 --> 00:35:39,882
according to the Commercial
Building Lease Protection Act.

702
00:35:39,883 --> 00:35:41,823
We're not trying to be stubborn.

703
00:35:41,883 --> 00:35:43,283
We've already compensated you!

704
00:35:43,883 --> 00:35:46,383
- Calm down.
- Nothing is getting through to him.

705
00:35:46,553 --> 00:35:47,623
Beob Kyu!

706
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:49,823
You're the ones who are being unreasonable.

707
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:52,193
Let's go.

708
00:35:54,883 --> 00:35:58,193
Don't waste our time like this again.

709
00:35:58,483 --> 00:36:01,823
I hope you know how important
time is for people like us...

710
00:36:02,383 --> 00:36:04,193
who live from day to day.

711
00:36:05,723 --> 00:36:06,723
Let's go.

712
00:36:10,883 --> 00:36:13,783
Goodness. What a headache.

713
00:36:14,193 --> 00:36:16,823
My father is already enough of a headache.

714
00:36:17,823 --> 00:36:20,383
I'll meet their leader and
try to talk to him again.

715
00:36:20,453 --> 00:36:21,983
You stay out of this. Ki Beom.

716
00:36:22,983 --> 00:36:24,283
Let's do what we do best.

717
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:27,983
Things like this keep happening
because we're trying to change.

718
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:30,943
Why should we take a more difficult
road when we have a solution?

719
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:33,483
What are you going to do
if it gets us in trouble?

720
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:37,383
Gosh. I'm really torn.

721
00:36:42,483 --> 00:36:43,483
Yes, Do Kyung.

722
00:36:44,723 --> 00:36:46,383
What? My father?

723
00:36:50,283 --> 00:36:52,483
What are you talking about?
Why would he disappear?

724
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:55,982
I don't know. I stepped out and when
I came back, his bed was empty.

725
00:36:55,983 --> 00:36:57,283
Did you inform his doctors?

726
00:36:57,383 --> 00:36:59,483
They've informed everyone at the
hospital and are looking for him.

727
00:36:59,623 --> 00:37:01,103
Let's go. We should look for him too.

728
00:37:05,283 --> 00:37:08,483
What do you mean President disappeared?
What happened?

729
00:37:08,983 --> 00:37:11,383
Why are you still here?

730
00:37:11,883 --> 00:37:14,283
Have you seen him?

731
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:17,383
Why would I have come
here if I had seen him?

732
00:37:17,823 --> 00:37:19,883
- Where did he go? - Tell me the truth.

733
00:37:20,723 --> 00:37:22,083
Did you do something to my father?

734
00:37:22,883 --> 00:37:25,083
Why are you doing this to me?

735
00:37:25,193 --> 00:37:27,553
- Why would I do anything to...
- How can I believe you?

736
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:29,283
How can I trust someone like you?

737
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:33,083
You jerk. What are you doing?

738
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:40,283
- Dad! - How dare you yell at Ms Oh!

739
00:37:41,383 --> 00:37:42,483
Stop being rude to her.

740
00:37:45,283 --> 00:37:46,383
President.

741
00:37:49,623 --> 00:37:52,883
Here. This is the steamed
bun that you like.

742
00:37:52,983 --> 00:37:54,063
Eat it before it gets cold.

743
00:37:57,383 --> 00:37:59,723
It's really sweet.

744
00:38:00,383 --> 00:38:02,623
Ms Oh. I'm sick of staying
here at the hospital.

745
00:38:02,693 --> 00:38:05,383
Let's go on a date. We
can go shopping, too.

746
00:38:06,693 --> 00:38:09,193
- President. - Dad, are you crazy?

747
00:38:09,283 --> 00:38:10,883
You're going to do what with this woman?

748
00:38:11,453 --> 00:38:13,483
Did you forget what this woman did to you?

749
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:14,653
Quiet.

750
00:38:14,723 --> 00:38:16,123
Why are you being so rude to Ms Oh!

751
00:38:19,623 --> 00:38:22,823
Let's go. This way.

752
00:38:34,193 --> 00:38:36,983
It looks like he lost his memory.

753
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,353
This is a rare case.

754
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,483
We can't rule out mental distress.

755
00:38:42,193 --> 00:38:44,193
He needs to receive regular treatment.

756
00:38:44,553 --> 00:38:46,193
We'll also do a few additional tests.

757
00:38:46,823 --> 00:38:49,823
The most important thing
is for him to rest.

758
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:52,483
If the patient wants to be
discharged, he may do so.

759
00:38:53,783 --> 00:38:54,853
I'll speak to you later.

760
00:38:54,883 --> 00:38:55,883
Thank you.

761
00:39:02,853 --> 00:39:04,783
You did something to him, didn't you?

762
00:39:05,653 --> 00:39:06,813
No wonder you wouldn't leave.

763
00:39:06,853 --> 00:39:09,453
What did you do to a sick old man?

764
00:39:09,653 --> 00:39:10,983
Ki Beom.

765
00:39:11,283 --> 00:39:12,753
That's enough.

766
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:13,983
You'll wake him up.

767
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:17,583
Gosh! You drive me insane.

768
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:25,383
I said, we should go on a date.

769
00:39:25,483 --> 00:39:27,283
Why did we come home?

770
00:39:27,723 --> 00:39:29,783
They say you need rest.

771
00:39:29,883 --> 00:39:31,653
Don't treat me like a patient.

772
00:39:31,723 --> 00:39:33,483
I'm completely fine.

773
00:39:33,983 --> 00:39:37,383
Well, I'm a little tired.

774
00:39:37,783 --> 00:39:38,982
Are you?

775
00:39:38,983 --> 00:39:40,983
You should have told me.

776
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,553
Sit down, sit down.

777
00:39:43,983 --> 00:39:44,983
Dad.

778
00:39:45,693 --> 00:39:47,723
- What's wrong with you? - What?

779
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:50,253
Don't you remember what she did?

780
00:39:50,983 --> 00:39:53,193
I'm more concerned about
what you did wrong.

781
00:39:53,253 --> 00:39:54,583
What did I do wrong?

782
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:57,283
All you do is cause trouble.

783
00:40:00,193 --> 00:40:01,883
Stay here, Ms Oh.

784
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,353
I'll get you some tea.

785
00:40:03,453 --> 00:40:04,553
I'm okay.

786
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:05,693
It's okay.

787
00:40:05,853 --> 00:40:07,753
There's no need for that.

788
00:40:12,853 --> 00:40:15,253
I was going to...

789
00:40:15,353 --> 00:40:16,983
leave when he woke up.

790
00:40:17,723 --> 00:40:19,353
But it all happened so suddenly.

791
00:40:19,853 --> 00:40:21,693
I'm not sure what to say.

792
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,653
Just don't say anything.

793
00:40:23,983 --> 00:40:25,883
You're driving me crazy.

794
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:29,853
Since it came to this,

795
00:40:30,253 --> 00:40:31,583
Ms Oh should...

796
00:40:31,753 --> 00:40:33,983
take care of President so that he can rest.

797
00:40:34,193 --> 00:40:36,653
What are you talking about?
She's not staying.

798
00:40:36,823 --> 00:40:39,083
We don't have any other choice.

799
00:40:41,753 --> 00:40:43,353
I'm home.

800
00:40:43,623 --> 00:40:45,882
Hi, Hyun Ji. You're late.

801
00:40:45,883 --> 00:40:48,193
- How's Grandpa? - He got discharged.

802
00:40:48,753 --> 00:40:49,753
Dad.

803
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:51,383
Can we talk?

804
00:40:53,653 --> 00:40:55,553
My princess!

805
00:40:55,623 --> 00:40:57,723
What do you want to talk about?

806
00:40:58,253 --> 00:40:59,283
- Dad. - Yes.

807
00:40:59,353 --> 00:41:00,883
I have something I want to ask you.

808
00:41:00,983 --> 00:41:02,653
Can you be honest with me?

809
00:41:02,723 --> 00:41:05,653
Well, what is it?

810
00:41:06,753 --> 00:41:08,623
Were you the one who kicked out...

811
00:41:08,693 --> 00:41:09,753
Sung Min's dad?

812
00:41:12,383 --> 00:41:13,623
What are you talking about?

813
00:41:14,253 --> 00:41:15,753
Why would I do that?

814
00:41:16,783 --> 00:41:18,083
Let me rephrase that.

815
00:41:18,953 --> 00:41:20,883
Did you do something to Sung Min?

816
00:41:24,193 --> 00:41:25,883
Did he say something?

817
00:41:26,353 --> 00:41:28,483
Did he say that I did
something wrong to him?

818
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:31,083
No, I'm asking you because
he won't tell me.

819
00:41:32,253 --> 00:41:34,583
There's something for sure,
but he won't tell me.

820
00:41:36,283 --> 00:41:37,353
He's avoiding me.

821
00:41:39,753 --> 00:41:41,983
Hyun Ji, I didn't do anything.

822
00:41:42,353 --> 00:41:43,983
Really? Can I trust you?

823
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:45,193
Of course.

824
00:41:46,483 --> 00:41:47,553
Dad.

825
00:41:47,853 --> 00:41:50,693
I hope you never disappoint me.

826
00:41:52,193 --> 00:41:53,623
You know what I mean, right?

827
00:41:55,883 --> 00:41:57,283
Of course.

828
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:16,483
(Stop the redevelopment project,
Choongshim Construction)

829
00:42:32,723 --> 00:42:33,723
What are you doing?

830
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:37,253
Oh.

831
00:42:40,283 --> 00:42:41,883
- What is this? - It's...

832
00:42:42,483 --> 00:42:44,083
It's galbi.

833
00:42:44,253 --> 00:42:45,983
Cook some for your dad.

834
00:42:46,453 --> 00:42:47,623
You should have some, too.

835
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:48,853
Are you kidding me?

836
00:42:49,283 --> 00:42:50,583
What are you trying to pull?

837
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:53,283
Do you think you can bribe
us with something like this?

838
00:42:54,353 --> 00:42:55,753
You're from that German bar, right?

839
00:42:55,883 --> 00:42:57,383
I guess you finally remembered.

840
00:43:00,553 --> 00:43:01,853
There are no words...

841
00:43:02,383 --> 00:43:04,083
that could express how sorry I am.

842
00:43:04,253 --> 00:43:05,813
Are you going to be me for forgiveness?

843
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:11,753
What happened...

844
00:43:12,253 --> 00:43:13,723
to your dad?

845
00:43:13,753 --> 00:43:16,283
After what happened to our store,
he fell ill from the shock.

846
00:43:16,853 --> 00:43:18,453
You gangsters...

847
00:43:18,483 --> 00:43:20,353
broke my family apart.

848
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:30,693
By the way,

849
00:43:31,453 --> 00:43:32,653
what did Choongshim Construction say?

850
00:43:32,883 --> 00:43:34,083
Do they want you to leave?

851
00:43:34,983 --> 00:43:36,223
I'm sure that's what they said.

852
00:43:36,883 --> 00:43:38,723
That's how it was like when I was there.

853
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:40,483
So what?

854
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:42,723
Are you telling me...

855
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:44,713
to give up if I don't want
to end up like my dad?

856
00:43:48,353 --> 00:43:50,083
Leave if that's all you have to say.

857
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:16,983
Hi, Tae Soo.

858
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:19,353
Why are you coming out from that room?

859
00:44:19,383 --> 00:44:20,983
You should go in.

860
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:22,353
Eun Ok's sick.

861
00:44:22,883 --> 00:44:23,983
What?

862
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,983
Honey.

863
00:44:28,753 --> 00:44:30,723
What's wrong?

864
00:44:32,353 --> 00:44:34,082
You're burning up.

865
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:35,403
Get up, let's go to the hospital.

866
00:44:35,483 --> 00:44:37,083
Goodness. There's no need for that.

867
00:44:37,623 --> 00:44:39,783
I took some pills and I feel fine now.

868
00:44:40,383 --> 00:44:41,483
The fever's coming down.

869
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:46,183
You need to rest at home for a few days.

870
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:48,553
What are you talking about?
What about our business?

871
00:44:48,623 --> 00:44:50,353
You need a break.

872
00:44:50,383 --> 00:44:52,553
I can work with Sung Koo.

873
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:53,753
We have your sister, too.

874
00:44:54,183 --> 00:44:55,383
Don't say that.

875
00:44:55,483 --> 00:44:57,383
I can't let my will be broken.

876
00:44:57,583 --> 00:44:59,723
I sure there will be many
more days like this.

877
00:44:59,753 --> 00:45:01,753
How can I take a break every time?

878
00:45:02,453 --> 00:45:04,353
You're so stubborn.

879
00:45:06,983 --> 00:45:09,653
I feel so much better after
seeing my handsome husband.

880
00:45:11,853 --> 00:45:12,853
Honey.

881
00:45:13,183 --> 00:45:15,083
Thank you for working so hard.

882
00:45:15,723 --> 00:45:17,753
I feel like you've finally
got on the right track.

883
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:19,753
It puts me at ease.

884
00:45:20,383 --> 00:45:21,783
Although I'm physically tired,

885
00:45:21,883 --> 00:45:23,883
I can sleep well.

886
00:45:25,253 --> 00:45:26,983
Then, why are you sick?

887
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:30,283
Go to bed.

888
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:34,083
You have to get well for you to work again.

889
00:45:34,353 --> 00:45:35,753
You need to sleep, too.

890
00:45:35,853 --> 00:45:37,453
Let's go out early tomorrow.

891
00:45:37,483 --> 00:45:39,453
I went out early today,

892
00:45:39,483 --> 00:45:40,883
and it seemed like there were...

893
00:45:40,983 --> 00:45:43,383
a lot of people passing our food
truck on their way to work.

894
00:45:43,883 --> 00:45:45,853
Let's try to get more
customers in the morning.

895
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:48,083
Okay, let's do that.

896
00:45:48,753 --> 00:45:49,853
Go to bed.

897
00:46:30,623 --> 00:46:33,283
(Please allow me to get through the day.)

898
00:46:35,283 --> 00:46:38,683
We know that you are the head
of the gangsters at Choongshim.

899
00:46:38,753 --> 00:46:40,583
There must be a misunderstanding.

900
00:46:40,653 --> 00:46:42,753
My husband has nothing to
do with them any more.

901
00:46:42,853 --> 00:46:45,853
I don't want you to get involved
with Choongshim from now on.

902
00:46:47,283 --> 00:46:49,083
Thinking about what they
made us go through,

903
00:46:49,283 --> 00:46:50,983
makes me shudder.

904
00:46:51,783 --> 00:46:52,823
Okay?

905
00:46:52,883 --> 00:46:55,323
After what happened to our store,
he fell ill from the shock.

906
00:46:55,353 --> 00:46:56,553
You gangsters...

907
00:46:56,683 --> 00:46:58,623
broke my family apart.

908
00:46:58,683 --> 00:46:59,983
Let me make myself clear.

909
00:47:00,383 --> 00:47:02,483
I won't let you do that to me again.

910
00:47:19,483 --> 00:47:22,353
Gosh, it's so cold.

911
00:47:22,383 --> 00:47:23,753
And there are no customers.

912
00:47:23,983 --> 00:47:26,983
That's weird, I thought we
would have more business.

913
00:47:27,853 --> 00:47:29,083
How are you feeling?

914
00:47:30,123 --> 00:47:31,603
You still have the chills, don't you?

915
00:47:32,283 --> 00:47:33,583
It's not that bad.

916
00:47:33,753 --> 00:47:35,823
We still have time until lunch.

917
00:47:35,883 --> 00:47:37,683
Go get some rest.

918
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,583
No, it'd be a waste of time.

919
00:47:41,853 --> 00:47:43,383
Then stay here.

920
00:47:43,753 --> 00:47:45,383
I'll go get you some honey tea.

921
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:47,783
Thank you.

922
00:48:10,853 --> 00:48:11,983
Get out of the way.

923
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:14,883
You still don't get it, do you?

924
00:48:16,253 --> 00:48:17,383
What are you doing?

925
00:48:17,883 --> 00:48:21,283
Why are you still in business?

926
00:48:21,553 --> 00:48:23,653
You should leave since you
received compensation.

927
00:48:23,753 --> 00:48:26,483
I told you, we need proper compensation.

928
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:28,483
Look at this punk...

929
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:30,253
talk back at me.

930
00:48:30,823 --> 00:48:32,853
Are you trying to play us...

931
00:48:33,383 --> 00:48:34,882
to get more money out of it?

932
00:48:34,883 --> 00:48:36,983
I don't know what your talking about.

933
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:39,853
- You little... - Don't you dare touch him.

934
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:41,183
I'll call the police.

935
00:48:41,253 --> 00:48:43,883
Please, call the police for us.

936
00:48:43,983 --> 00:48:46,453
Let's ask them who's here illegally.

937
00:48:46,483 --> 00:48:49,043
We don't have any reason to budge
until our case has been tried.

938
00:48:49,183 --> 00:48:51,453
Our attorney told us that
we can win this case.

939
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:54,783
I was going to do this peacefully,

940
00:48:54,853 --> 00:48:57,053
but if you're going to be
like this, we can't help you.

941
00:48:57,283 --> 00:48:58,723
Shall we start?

942
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:00,353
- Boys. - Yes.

943
00:49:04,853 --> 00:49:05,883
Stop it!

944
00:49:07,453 --> 00:49:09,753
Hey! Stop it now!

945
00:49:15,383 --> 00:49:17,023
Beob Kyu, what do you think you're doing?

946
00:49:17,853 --> 00:49:19,083
Seriously.

947
00:49:20,553 --> 00:49:23,353
It's none of your business. Stay out of it.

948
00:49:23,383 --> 00:49:24,653
We're doing business right now.

949
00:49:24,923 --> 00:49:28,083
You have no right to be involved in
any matters related to Choongshim!

950
00:49:28,283 --> 00:49:29,653
If that's the case, do it right.

951
00:49:30,553 --> 00:49:32,283
Stop bothering innocent people.

952
00:49:34,883 --> 00:49:37,483
You can't do this, Tae Soo.

953
00:49:37,553 --> 00:49:39,583
You think you can do whatever you
want because you've left Choongshim?

954
00:49:39,653 --> 00:49:42,183
I don't want to deal with you any more.
Just leave.

955
00:49:42,283 --> 00:49:44,823
- Tae Soo! - Leave! Are you deaf?

956
00:49:51,383 --> 00:49:54,453
Fine. I can come back another day.

957
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:57,183
- Let's go! - Yes, Sir.

958
00:49:58,083 --> 00:50:00,383
We'll see you later, okay?

959
00:50:01,753 --> 00:50:04,653
If you move out before that,
it'd be better for all of us!

960
00:50:19,283 --> 00:50:20,283
Are you okay?

961
00:50:21,383 --> 00:50:23,823
You have to be careful
in situations like this.

962
00:50:24,883 --> 00:50:27,283
I know that you're angry, but
your safety is more important.

963
00:50:29,183 --> 00:50:32,083
I'm moving my food truck.
I came to say goodbye.

964
00:50:32,483 --> 00:50:34,523
I hope that the misunderstanding
can be cleared up.

965
00:50:37,853 --> 00:50:38,953
Keep your chin up.

966
00:50:40,283 --> 00:50:41,853
I don't know what to tell you.

967
00:50:46,083 --> 00:50:47,383
Did you plot this with them?

968
00:50:47,453 --> 00:50:50,853
Are you playing good cop bad cop?

969
00:50:57,983 --> 00:51:01,853
All I can say is that I'm sorry.

970
00:51:02,353 --> 00:51:04,113
What do you mean there's
nothing you can do?

971
00:51:04,453 --> 00:51:05,883
You can help us.

972
00:51:09,253 --> 00:51:11,883
What's wrong with you? You're
asking a gangster to help us?

973
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:17,253
You held a high position when
you were at Choongshim, right?

974
00:51:17,883 --> 00:51:19,453
Then you should be able to help us.

975
00:51:33,453 --> 00:51:34,553
No.

976
00:51:35,753 --> 00:51:37,193
My husband doesn't do that any more.

977
00:51:37,723 --> 00:51:39,353
He has nothing to do with Choongshim.

978
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:40,583
Honey.

979
00:51:41,653 --> 00:51:42,753
Tell them.

980
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,583
You promised me to never get
involved with Choongshim again.

981
00:52:00,683 --> 00:52:01,683
I'm...

982
00:52:02,483 --> 00:52:03,623
I'm sorry.

983
00:52:04,623 --> 00:52:06,453
I'm not in a position to help you.

984
00:52:08,183 --> 00:52:10,453
Everyone, I'm so sorry.

985
00:52:14,083 --> 00:52:15,753
I hate to say this to you,

986
00:52:17,253 --> 00:52:18,893
but you won't be able to win this battle.

987
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:21,283
End it here.

988
00:52:22,353 --> 00:52:23,983
I don't want you to get hurt.

989
00:52:24,483 --> 00:52:25,583
No.

990
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,653
Whether you help me or not,
I will fight Choongshim.

991
00:52:32,753 --> 00:52:33,853
I can't back off now.

992
00:52:37,283 --> 00:52:39,753
Let's go. We should to back
to our food truck now.

993
00:52:40,653 --> 00:52:41,653
Hurry up.

994
00:52:54,183 --> 00:52:56,653
What? Tae Soo got involved?

995
00:52:56,753 --> 00:52:59,283
Why would Tae Soo get involved in this?

996
00:52:59,883 --> 00:53:02,083
Well... I don't really know.

997
00:53:02,883 --> 00:53:05,023
Anyway, because of Tae Soo,

998
00:53:05,383 --> 00:53:07,553
those jerks at Manbok
Shophouse think they can win.

999
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:13,353
He makes my life difficult
even after leaving Choongshim.

1000
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:18,353
Well, shouldn't we do something about it?

1001
00:53:20,883 --> 00:53:21,883
You're right.

1002
00:53:24,653 --> 00:53:26,353
Write your name and sign at the bottom.

1003
00:53:27,853 --> 00:53:28,853
What is this?

1004
00:53:28,953 --> 00:53:30,753
(I, Yoon Tae Soo, will never
get involved with Choongshim.)

1005
00:53:30,853 --> 00:53:31,853
Goodness.

1006
00:53:32,553 --> 00:53:35,983
Is this a joke? Are you seriously
asking me to sign this?

1007
00:53:36,353 --> 00:53:39,183
I'm doing this because I can't trust you.

1008
00:53:39,553 --> 00:53:42,683
Sign it. And report to me even
when you go to the bathroom.

1009
00:53:42,883 --> 00:53:45,653
I couldn't just walk by, so I
said a few things. That's all.

1010
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:49,083
It was a good chance to clear up the
misunderstanding with them, too.

1011
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:51,663
Then you could've just talked to them.
You made me wait and...

1012
00:53:52,783 --> 00:53:54,703
Why were you listening to
them ask you for help?

1013
00:53:55,553 --> 00:53:58,083
My heart sank when I saw you hesitate.

1014
00:53:59,283 --> 00:54:00,353
This way.

1015
00:54:02,753 --> 00:54:04,183
Hey! Tae Soo!

1016
00:54:06,983 --> 00:54:08,083
Hello, Eun Ok.

1017
00:54:08,853 --> 00:54:10,383
What's this?

1018
00:54:10,983 --> 00:54:13,823
"I, Yoon Tae Soo, will never
get involved with Choongshim."

1019
00:54:14,453 --> 00:54:16,553
Yes. This is great.

1020
00:54:17,123 --> 00:54:19,183
Eun Ok, I've always known
that you're the wise one.

1021
00:54:20,483 --> 00:54:21,623
Why are you here?

1022
00:54:21,723 --> 00:54:24,083
I came her for the kimchi fried rice.
Why else?

1023
00:54:24,383 --> 00:54:25,653
Can I get two servings?

1024
00:54:29,553 --> 00:54:31,253
Are you done for the day?

1025
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:35,383
Why would we close up already?
I'll make it for you now.

1026
00:54:36,253 --> 00:54:38,723
Thank you. That looks good.

1027
00:54:39,353 --> 00:54:40,553
Spare me a second.

1028
00:54:48,383 --> 00:54:49,453
What do you want to talk to me about?

1029
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:51,383
Stay out of things that are
none of your business.

1030
00:54:51,453 --> 00:54:53,453
Just focus on your own business.

1031
00:54:53,553 --> 00:54:55,083
Do your job properly.

1032
00:54:55,883 --> 00:54:59,183
Why can't you give them what
they rightfully deserve?

1033
00:54:59,753 --> 00:55:01,353
Doing so won't hurt Choongshim at all.

1034
00:55:01,753 --> 00:55:03,883
Rather, it'll improve the company's image.

1035
00:55:05,453 --> 00:55:09,383
Tae Soo. Everyone is telling
me what to do these days.

1036
00:55:09,453 --> 00:55:12,883
Dad lectures at me. Even Do Kyung
and Hyun Ji tell me what to do.

1037
00:55:12,983 --> 00:55:15,453
And now, you're going to
join them and lecture me?

1038
00:55:16,253 --> 00:55:18,983
Mind your own business and make fried rice.

1039
00:55:19,353 --> 00:55:22,083
People's lives were ruined because of us.

1040
00:55:22,183 --> 00:55:23,853
Have some decency and don't
take them down again.

1041
00:55:23,883 --> 00:55:26,603
Stop worrying about other people.
Worry about keeping your own life!

1042
00:55:26,653 --> 00:55:28,983
- Are you threatening me now?
- I'm not threatening you.

1043
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:31,733
I'm giving you a word of advice.

1044
00:55:32,083 --> 00:55:34,123
Anyway, this is the last
advice I'll be giving you.

1045
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:35,823
You know what's next, right?

1046
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,563
What if I tell you that I don't know?

1047
00:55:41,653 --> 00:55:43,653
Here's your kimchi fried rice.

1048
00:55:44,553 --> 00:55:46,283
Thanks, Eun Ok.

1049
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:48,753
You should go.

1050
00:55:49,753 --> 00:55:52,083
I'm sure Tae Soo understood
everything you said.

1051
00:55:54,183 --> 00:55:55,883
Yes, I shall.

1052
00:55:56,723 --> 00:55:58,753
Tae Soo. I'm going now.

1053
00:55:59,883 --> 00:56:01,083
Beob Kyu, let's go!

1054
00:56:03,853 --> 00:56:05,553
Goodness.

1055
00:56:11,553 --> 00:56:15,083
Fine. I'll sign it.

1056
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:19,353
Mr Choi. What are you talking about now?

1057
00:56:19,923 --> 00:56:23,083
What have I done to them?
Why are they suing me now?

1058
00:56:23,283 --> 00:56:24,683
Gosh. This is making my blood boil.

1059
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:27,983
I'll get back to you.

1060
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:32,882
Are they suing you?

1061
00:56:32,883 --> 00:56:35,383
They're targeting me now because
they haven't been able...

1062
00:56:35,453 --> 00:56:38,083
to get anything out of Choongshim.

1063
00:56:38,183 --> 00:56:40,883
These jerks. They have no idea
what they're dealing with.

1064
00:56:40,983 --> 00:56:43,253
Ki Beom. Let's teach them a lesson.

1065
00:56:43,553 --> 00:56:45,753
We've been too easy on them.

1066
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,083
Hello?

1067
00:57:02,453 --> 00:57:04,753
It's me, Chul, from Manbok Shophouse.

1068
00:57:06,853 --> 00:57:08,183
Who? Chul?

1069
00:57:09,983 --> 00:57:11,653
The gangsters from Choongshim...

1070
00:57:12,553 --> 00:57:15,653
are vandalising our store right now!
Can you help us?

1071
00:57:17,253 --> 00:57:18,253
Please help us!

1072
00:57:22,723 --> 00:57:25,253
- Chul, it's... - Please help us!

1073
00:57:25,853 --> 00:57:27,823
You're the only one who can help us.

1074
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:31,353
- Stop it! - Move out of the way.

1075
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:34,883
Chul. Chul!

1076
00:57:39,083 --> 00:57:41,353
What's going on? Manbok Shophouse?

1077
00:57:41,883 --> 00:57:43,553
- They called you? - Yes.

1078
00:57:44,553 --> 00:57:46,353
I think Choongshim sent some guys.

1079
00:57:47,353 --> 00:57:50,153
That boy is Sung Min's age. He was
probably staying up all night to...

1080
00:57:50,753 --> 00:57:52,183
protect his shop.

1081
00:57:52,883 --> 00:57:55,883
So? Are you going to run over there?

1082
00:57:59,283 --> 00:58:00,283
Gosh.

1083
00:58:01,653 --> 00:58:02,753
Are you?

1084
00:58:03,653 --> 00:58:04,753
Goodness.

1085
00:58:08,853 --> 00:58:09,853
Well...

1086
00:58:11,183 --> 00:58:13,283
I promised you I wouldn't.

1087
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:15,353
I'm not going.

1088
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:20,083
Go back to sleep now.

1089
00:58:23,383 --> 00:58:26,823
- Honey. - I'm not going.

1090
00:58:32,553 --> 00:58:34,553
I'm getting myself a glass of water.

1091
00:58:35,983 --> 00:58:36,983
Go back to sleep.

1092
00:59:45,983 --> 00:59:47,453
Get off of him.

1093
00:59:48,083 --> 00:59:50,653
You're the boss here, right?

1094
00:59:50,723 --> 00:59:52,283
Please make them stop!

1095
00:59:52,383 --> 00:59:53,783
You don't remember me, do you?

1096
00:59:54,183 --> 00:59:56,283
I won't let you do that to me again.

1097
00:59:56,383 --> 00:59:57,783
You can help us.

1098
00:59:57,883 --> 01:00:00,283
You held a high position when
you were at Choongshim, right?

1099
01:00:00,483 --> 01:00:01,883
Then you should be able to help us.

1100
01:00:04,253 --> 01:00:05,783
Can you help us?

1101
01:00:07,083 --> 01:00:08,353
Please help us.

1102
01:00:08,483 --> 01:00:10,383
You're the only one who can help us.

1103
01:00:17,683 --> 01:00:20,483
I don't want you to get involved
with Choongshim from now on.

1104
01:00:21,353 --> 01:00:23,113
Thinking about what they
made us go through,

1105
01:00:23,253 --> 01:00:24,983
makes me shudder.

1106
01:00:25,683 --> 01:00:26,723
Honey.

1107
01:00:27,253 --> 01:00:28,953
Thank you for working so hard.

1108
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:32,083
I feel like you've finally
got on the right track.

1109
01:00:32,353 --> 01:00:33,823
It puts me at ease.

1110
01:00:34,783 --> 01:00:36,123
Although I'm physically tired,

1111
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:38,183
I can sleep well.

1112
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,823
No.

1113
01:00:41,183 --> 01:00:42,823
My husband doesn't do that any more.

1114
01:00:42,883 --> 01:00:44,683
He has nothing to do with Choongshim.

1115
01:00:44,783 --> 01:00:46,483
Write your name and sign at the bottom.

1116
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:48,503
Why were you listening to
them ask you for help?

1117
01:00:49,353 --> 01:00:51,983
My heart sank when I saw you hesitate.

1118
01:01:08,083 --> 01:01:09,083
Go.

1119
01:01:24,823 --> 01:01:26,783
I must have been destined to be...

1120
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:28,783
a wife of a gangster.

1121
01:01:31,453 --> 01:01:33,483
I thought 18 years was enough.

1122
01:01:34,823 --> 01:01:36,623
I wanted to live like a normal person.

1123
01:01:38,883 --> 01:01:40,683
But I guess it's not in the stars for me.

1124
01:01:45,183 --> 01:01:46,783
I won't be able to stop if I go now.

1125
01:01:48,253 --> 01:01:49,733
I'll have to help them until the end.

1126
01:01:52,253 --> 01:01:53,983
You think I don't know that?

1127
01:01:58,553 --> 01:01:59,583
Go.

1128
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:02,583
Go save the country or go save a man.

1129
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,883
Do whatever you want.

1130
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:08,653
- Honey. - Go!

1131
01:02:09,723 --> 01:02:11,483
Go before I change my mind.

1132
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:52,583
(Sweet and Scary Family)

1133
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,453
You'll be going behind bars.

1134
01:02:54,483 --> 01:02:56,163
Drop the lawsuit against Manbok Shophouse.

1135
01:02:56,483 --> 01:02:58,383
Did you stick your nose in
someone else's business?

1136
01:02:58,483 --> 01:02:59,982
Will it get you in trouble?

1137
01:02:59,983 --> 01:03:01,283
You're not living this life alone.

1138
01:03:01,353 --> 01:03:03,083
You need to look around and help others.

1139
01:03:03,183 --> 01:03:05,983
Mr Park called and said
that he's going to quit.

1140
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:07,483
How can you fight without a lawyer?

1141
01:03:07,553 --> 01:03:09,353
If you want to win, you need to toughen up.

1142
01:03:09,383 --> 01:03:10,753
We will lose if we don't unite.

1143
01:03:10,883 --> 01:03:12,583
You need to question me
at the police station?

1144
01:03:12,653 --> 01:03:14,083
You don't have to be someone I'm proud of.

1145
01:03:14,183 --> 01:03:15,583
But don't be the person I am ashamed of.

1146
01:03:15,653 --> 01:03:18,353
Mum, let's move back to our old house.

1147
01:03:18,483 --> 01:03:19,653
For the last three years,

1148
01:03:19,723 --> 01:03:21,453
I was really happy...

1149
01:03:21,483 --> 01:03:22,883
and thankful.

1150
01:03:22,983 --> 01:03:24,883
Just let me go.

1151
01:03:25,723 --> 01:03:27,883
Why are you waiting for someone
that's not going to come?

1152
01:03:27,983 --> 01:03:30,483
We have to leave this
place if we want to live.

1153
01:03:30,783 --> 01:03:32,983
Attacking them first can
be our best defence.

1154
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:34,083
I apologise.

1155
01:03:34,183 --> 01:03:36,623
I calculated the compensation,

1156
01:03:36,783 --> 01:03:39,023
and it turns out you should
be getting twice the amount.

1157
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:41,783
We want you out of this.

1158
01:03:41,883 --> 01:03:44,623
With money and power, you can do anything.

1159
01:03:44,683 --> 01:03:45,983
Boss!

1160
01:04:16,183 --> 01:04:17,883
The Family Court is always full.

1161
01:04:17,983 --> 01:04:19,083
(Go Dong Mi, never had a boyfriend)

1162
01:04:19,183 --> 01:04:22,753
You should be suspicious.
Reasonable suspicion is important.

1163
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,223
(Baek Da Jeong, soon to be divorced)

1164
01:04:24,283 --> 01:04:26,983
Bring me the big ones. As big as melons!

1165
01:04:27,083 --> 01:04:28,083
(Hong Ae Ran, soon to be married)

1166
01:04:28,283 --> 01:04:30,383
(A romantic comedy with a cheerful energy)

1167
01:04:30,623 --> 01:04:33,383
(Happy Ending Once Again)
