1
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,947
Once upon a time,

2
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,949
in a far-off land,

3
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,453
lived a girl
and her mother and father.

4
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,958
Their village was surrounded
by a high wall.

5
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,461
Outside the wall was the forest,

6
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,964
home of Baba Yaga, the witch.

7
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,966
Baba Yaga had iron teeth

8
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,968
that could bite through trees.

9
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,471
His legs were like chicken legs,

10
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:59,334
and he ate little girls
for dinner.

11
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,976
But inside the wall,

12
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,979
the girl was safe.

13
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:13,048
Stick 'em up, injun.

14
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,555
Try the Madison house first.

15
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,057
Then the Langers.

16
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,560
Skip the Cutcheners.
They're in Rhode Island.

17
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,060
That's the Laughlins.

18
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,062
The Cutcheners are in town.

19
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,565
Don't forget to ring
3 or 4 times

20
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,567
the Neils in Birchgrove Court.

21
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,068
Wife is almost deaf.

22
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,570
And on the school board.

23
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,072
Everyone will get a taste

24
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,073
of the Stockards.

25
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,575
Yum yum.

26
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,077
These are ready.

27
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,586
Billy! Snack time!

28
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,767
Don't lose the money you get.

29
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,610
Everyone loves that smile.
Remember.

30
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,612
Your photo will be
in the papers.

31
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,614
If she sells the most bags.

32
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,615
Oh, she will.

33
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,617
She's the perfect
little saleswoman.

34
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,619
Make a good impression, honey.

35
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,621
We're still the new kids
on the block.

36
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,623
Off to work we go.

37
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,124
Don't fiddle with your socks.

38
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,627
They're just new.

39
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,127
Be careful on the roads.

40
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,629
Watch for cars.
Look left and right.

41
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,131
Now get going.

42
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,635
Whatever you do,

43
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:43,118
don't go outside
the gate, sweetheart.

44
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,141
Daddy loves you.

Devon Stockard.

48
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,163
Now, there's a girl who's
out to conquer the world.

49
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:11,167
You want me to buy a bag
of those cookies from you?

50
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,169
You're not on my list.

51
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,186
Can I help you?

52
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,688
Yeah. I finished your lawn, sir.

53
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,189
Already?

54
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,192
I did a good job.
Shrubs, back, and sides.

55
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,694
Got all the weeds, sir.

56
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,197
Thank you.

57
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:51,245
Sir, you think I could use
your bathroom facilities?

58
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,211
Guess not.

59
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,727
Ahh.

60
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,779
Can I give you some help, son?

61
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,281
Oh, I can get it, thanks.

62
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,786
Just tell me when.

63
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,288
Just a minute.

64
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,803
Ok.

65
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,306
Nothing.

66
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,308
All right, try it again.

67
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,313
Get in.

68
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,820
Lots of lawns.

69
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,822
Business must be good.

70
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,824
Well, I'm not complaining.

71
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,326
You live close by here?

72
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,829
Not that close by.

73
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,830
Ha.

74
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,332
Me either.

75
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,836
What you got in that cooler?

76
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,838
Oh. Soda pop.

77
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,340
Shit. I was hoping
it was ice-cold beer.

78
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,342
It's hotter than
a cat's crotch today,

79
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,343
isn't it?

80
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,344
Yeah.

81
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:12,507
And I stink. I need a shower.

82
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:29,304
I used to mow lawns
when I was a kid.

83
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,365
After a while,

84
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,868
it gets to be there's
nothing in the world

85
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,870
but lawns. Green lawns.

86
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,872
And the best damn thing
about lawns is...

87
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,875
They always grow back.

88
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,377
Let's not be in here past 5:00

89
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,200
unless you clear it
with me first.

He's insane. No doubt about it.

106
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,690
I wonder if he's gonna
be here next Friday.

107
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,019
Come on.

108
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,521
Show's over.

109
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,046
At the edge
of a big, dark forest,

110
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,549
lived a girl
and her mother and father.

111
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,552
One day, her mother said, "girl,

112
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,055
"I shall make you
a batch of cookies,

113
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,058
and you must go
and sell them in the forest."

114
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,060
Now, the girl was not stupid.

115
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,562
She knew they were trying
to get rid of her.

116
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,064
But her father said,
"don't argue,"

117
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,566
so she went.

118
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,571
The girl walked on

119
00:10:56,572 --> 00:11:01,716
till she came to
a clearing in the forest.

120
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,109
In the middle of the clearing,

121
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,111
there was a hut

122
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,614
and a very skinny dog.

123
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,622
The dog was starving.

124
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,625
The girl said to the dog,
"you look hungry."

125
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,628
So she fed it.

126
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:20,155
Baba Yaga's house.

127
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,194
Oh.

128
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:12,708
Hello.

129
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,709
I'm Devon Tompkins Stockard,

130
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,211
young ranger.

131
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,213
I'm selling thumbprint cookies.

132
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,714
All proceeds

133
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,716
go to the pine cone
charity house

134
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,719
of mccade county.

135
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,245
Is that a '65 Ford?

136
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,246
The '65 f-100

137
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,748
is the best motor
Ford ever made.

138
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,251
Is it 3 on a tree?

139
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,253
Yeah.

140
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,254
My uncle had a truck like that.

141
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,256
He was Russian...

142
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,258
From Indiana.

143
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,261
Born on the wrong side
of the train.

144
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,880
Wrong side of the tracks.

145
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,765
Right.

146
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,269
He said the mounts were
going bad on the truck,

147
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,772
so one night he drove it
into spoon river

148
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,275
and never drove back out.

149
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,777
What a shame.

150
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,779
That's what my aunt said.

151
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,781
You can rebuild them mounts.

152
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,282
I did.

153
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,064
Can you take me
for a ride in it?

154
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,791
I don't want to buy any...

155
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,293
Cookies.

156
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,295
This is private property.

157
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,797
Go home.

158
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,324
4 bags?

159
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,325
Does that include
the 2 that we bought?

160
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,826
You'll have to do
better than that.

161
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,329
How far did you get
down the list?

162
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,830
It all depends on your face.

163
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,333
It's not what you got
in the bags they want to buy.

164
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,834
It's your happy face.

165
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,338
The ones that weren't home,
try tomorrow.

166
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,339
Don't forget to say
it's for the charity house.

167
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,842
Be a shame if some other girl
got her picture in the paper.

168
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,845
You'll do better
tomorrow, sweetheart.

169
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,348
Give me a kiss.

170
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,850
Good night, sweetheart.

171
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,352
Mmm.

172
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,355
I'll be up in a little while.

173
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,857
I changed your
doctor's appointment

174
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,359
for day after tomorrow,

175
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,861
9:30 A.M.

176
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,886
I'd like to see her
happy for a change.

177
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,888
She's going through a stage.

178
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:14,890
It's her age.

179
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,892
Yeah, but all we get
is mope and complain.

180
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,894
Imagine what she'll be like
in a few years.

181
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,396
She hardly complains.

182
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,398
She could at least
pretend to be happy.

183
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,899
When I was a kid,

184
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,901
that's what you did
for your parents.

185
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,903
We've only been settled
for a couple of months.

186
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:29,904
Give it time.

187
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,407
She's met that one girl. Donna?

188
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:35,411
Oh, I feel sorry
for that Donna kid's father.

189
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:38,913
Imagine having a... ow...

190
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:42,777
Daughter with a face
like a possum.

191
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,424
She's got a lovely voice.

192
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,426
If I'm gonna have a voice,
we've gotta start pushing.

193
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,187
Elections for the county board
are this fall.

194
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,430
That will be 4 boards
you're going after.

195
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,931
You'll have to be careful

196
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,434
you don't lose your own voice.

197
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,935
If I want a real say
in this county,

198
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,938
in this suburb right here
where we live,

199
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,940
then I've got to become
the board man...

200
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,944
The model
of citizen involvement.

201
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:13,768
Isn't that why
we moved back here?

202
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:51,486
Awoo!

203
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:56,492
Awoo!

204
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:20,034
I want us all to make
a home here, Dev.

205
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:24,538
I want you to find
lots of new friends.

206
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,523
Popular girl is never bored.

207
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,024
Or boring.

208
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,531
Look, honey...

209
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,533
This is the new Dev.

210
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,034
Right here.

211
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,038
You don't have to tell
your new friends

212
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,579
anything about the old Dev

213
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,041
you don't want to.

214
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,043
And the new Devon,

215
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:53,247
she's raring to go, isn't she?

216
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,555
I love you, honey.

217
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,562
The world's at your feet,

218
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,563
sweetheart.

219
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,566
Thanks, dad.

220
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,080
Aah!

221
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,583
Halt, squaw!

222
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:37,531
You'd be doing
the community a favor.

223
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,103
Bang.

224
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,619
Hello, Mrs. Stockard.

225
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,621
Hello, Brett.

226
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,623
You should call

227
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,124
spray green lawn service.

228
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,627
They'll have those weeds out
in a couple of hours.

229
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,629
I like to work up
a little sweat.

230
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,631
If you leave the root in,
it'll grow back.

231
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,134
Just ripping the heads off
is more fun.

232
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,637
Would you like to lend a hand?

233
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,137
And do something useful
this summer?

234
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,640
Sounds criminal to me.

235
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,642
You should both
have summer jobs,

236
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,645
keep your minds sharp.

237
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:34,548
If we had jobs,
who'd help you weed?

238
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:47,801
I'll just let you two
finish up here, huh?

239
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,191
Woman, giggling: Stop it.

240
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,693
No. Stop.

241
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,696
Stop it.

242
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,206
Stop it!

243
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,709
Grr.

244
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,212
Mmm.

245
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,718
What was that?

246
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,226
Hey,

247
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,728
isn't that my belt?

248
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,730
Found it on the dresser.

249
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,871
But how am I supposed
to keep my pants up?

250
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,736
You'll think of something.

251
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,236
Hey, uh, Patty.

252
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,738
You sure you don't want
that ride? Country club?

253
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,740
Tables, tennis courts?

254
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,742
No, thanks. I can make it.

255
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,244
And it's Pam.

256
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,245
Pam Gregory.

257
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,247
See you, trailer man.

258
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,751
Hey, I'm not always
gonna live in a soup can.

259
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,253
Next year, I'm gonna be
at the, uh...

260
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,756
White house.

261
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,268
Baba Yaga went inside,

262
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,932
put a huge kettle on to boil.

263
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,776
The dog told the girl to run

264
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,779
'cause Baba Yaga
was going to cook her.

265
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,781
But the girl knew

266
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:50,384
she could never outrun
Baba Yaga bony legs.

267
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,789
When they sent the girl
into the forest,

268
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,291
she was kind to the things
she found.

269
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,295
She found a tree and
dressed it up in ribbons.

270
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:04,738
Trees don't give a shit
about people.

271
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,301
Was that your girlfriend?

272
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,804
Look, I got some lawns
to take care of,

273
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,305
so...

274
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,807
Can you climb a tree?

275
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,309
I'd climb it myself,

276
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,812
but I'm not supposed to strain.

277
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,313
I'm telling you to leave.

278
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,317
Ok, I'll leave...

279
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,820
But only if you help me hang
the rest of these ribbons.

280
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,321
I don't like ribbons,

281
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:30,324
and I got me a hangover.

282
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,832
You know, I almost died.

283
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,334
Twice.

284
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,835
Climbing a tree?

285
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,837
No.

286
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:43,839
I almost died, too.

287
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:44,840
How?

288
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,341
Shotgun.

289
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,343
You?

290
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,846
It's a lemon... my heart.

291
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:54,348
You know how yours goes
dee-dum, dee-dum, dee-dum?

292
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,850
Yeah.

293
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,853
Mine goes dee-dee-dum,
dee-dee-dum, dee-dee-dum.

294
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,856
So are you dying or what?

295
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,357
Not anymore.

296
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:06,861
They put in an extra
pumping station.

297
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,363
Mmm. Nice.

298
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,367
Can I see your scar?

299
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,368
It's ugly.

300
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,370
Cool.

301
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,874
Don't you have any friends
your age?

302
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,876
Kids you can hang out with
and stuff?

303
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,377
I don't like kids.

304
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,379
They smell like TV.

305
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,382
And they talk too fast.

306
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,887
Higher. Go higher.

307
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,389
Shit!

308
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,909
Ohh...

309
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:59,413
Aah!

310
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:03,918
Ohhh!

311
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,701
Hey! I could be dying over here.

312
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,430
Is your heart going
diddy-dum, diddy-dum,

313
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:16,431
diddy-dum?

314
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,432
Something like that.

315
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,935
Hey, come here.

316
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,437
Get me a beer out of my truck.

317
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,440
It's in the cooler.

318
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:29,303
And the cigarettes
are on the dash.

319
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,966
Beep beep!

320
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,469
Ohhhh!

321
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,479
Ohh.

322
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,483
Mmm.

323
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,505
Where'd you get shot?

324
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,507
In the gut.

325
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,010
By a robber?

326
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,514
Look, I have to do 3,
maybe 4 lawns.

327
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,016
You're from Camelot, right?

328
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,019
Camelot Gardens. Yup.

329
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,641
Over the hills and far away.

330
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,348
It's better
if I let you off here.

331
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,530
Yeah, I know.

332
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,063
We're told
by other U.S. officials

333
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,433
that this was a clear desire
on the part of the U.S...

334
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,066
Tracker.

335
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,926
To try to embarrass
Saddam Hussein.

336
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,069
Be careful, Devon.

337
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,571
My dog doesn't like kids.

338
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:39,073
That would be
a further infringement...

339
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,576
Clare! People are getting
hungry out here, dear.

340
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:43,578
Tracker.

341
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
Tracker.

342
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,082
Leave the dog be, honey.

343
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,584
Zone operations with impunity.

344
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,086
Would you go tell her

345
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,587
we're about ready for the salad?

346
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,588
All right.

347
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,590
He is now in the oval office.

348
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,093
We're told he has
a brief statement.

349
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,794
He will make that statement...

350
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,598
They need the salad,
Mrs. Stockard.

351
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,101
Yes, well...

352
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,604
I should think we could have
that ready in about 4 minutes.

353
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,107
What do you say?

354
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,126
Yes.

355
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,651
The salade est arrivé.

356
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,173
Hey.

357
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,189
Oh, hello.

358
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,190
Can I help you?

359
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,691
I finished your lawn, sir.

360
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,194
I did the trimming as well,
and I blew the...

361
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,196
Oh, yes.

362
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,818
We heard you loud and clear.

363
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,700
Worked up an appetite, son?

364
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,202
Oh.

365
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,704
Devon, throw a couple
of hot dogs on the grill

366
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,705
for this young man.

367
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,207
Oh, no, thank you, sir,
but I better...

368
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,708
I better get back to work.

369
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:58,271
Nonsense. You go take
a seat over there.

Hey, I heard a rumor

375
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,734
that Pamela Gregory
screwed you last night?

376
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,897
Now, tell me that isn't true.

377
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:28,081
What could you and her
possibly have in common?

378
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,746
Ah, Brett, putting your
social skills to work again.

Yes, I am.

So what you gonna be
when you grow up, huh?

381
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,754
Landscape designer?

382
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:42,756
Conservationist?

383
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,259
Hey, which colleges
you apply to, boy?

384
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,261
Real charmer, isn't he?

385
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:48,762
What about computer design?

386
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,265
That's a solid choice.

387
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,266
Everybody's going in
for that these days.

388
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,269
Yeah, let's talk about
exotic careers.

389
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,772
High-diving, for instance.

390
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,774
Say from... bridges.

391
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:04,361
Say single-lane bridges.

392
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,780
Hot dogs coming up.

393
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,282
Plenty of ketchup
for you, right?

394
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,285
Yeah. Oh, thank you, sir.

395
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,288
You wouldn't happen
to know anything

396
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:14,289
about all those lampshades

397
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,790
keep disappearing
around here, would you?

It's the funniest thing.

401
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,959
I mean, what could a person
do with so many lampshades?

402
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,803
Sell them.

403

Sir...

404

Oh. All right,

you're just $10 shy
here, Mr. Stockard.

I'm saying you're $10 shy

Third grade, remember?

428
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:55,889
No.

429
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,891
I was only there a few months.

430
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,894
My parents pulled me out
and put me in private.

431
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:01,895
Oh, yeah.

432
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,397
Yeah.

433
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,400
Yeah, your dad
drove that blue BMW.

434
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,403
Did he?

435
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,905
I don't remember.

436
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,407
I remember.
It was the only new car

437
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,887
in the school
parking lot that winter.

438
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,412
We were friends, right?

439
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:23,236
No. We was just
in the same class.

440
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,424
You should know better

441
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,928
than to come to a party
dressed like shit.

442
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,871
In third grade,
you had better taste.

443
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:44,915
My bet is you could have
made a good surgeon.

444
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,941
Like your daddy?

445
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,063
You've got the hands for it.

446
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,503
Go ahead,

447
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,505
make my day.

448
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,507
Bah!

449
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,511
Oh.

450
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,514
Daddy's gun, huh?

451
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,019
That's pretty dangerous.

452
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,024
Hmm.

453
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,028
You ever wonder...

454
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:18,431
What one of these
might feel like...

455
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,535
Going in?

456
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,539
You smell like your mom.

457
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,044
Get out!

458
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,548
Hey.

459
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,049
Shh.

460
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,057
Mom.

461
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,058
Hmm?

462
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,061
Tracy asked me if I
could spend the night.

463
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,562
Tracy who?

464
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,564
Tracy Keller.

465
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:54,568
You know, I met her
at the picnic last week.

466
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,570
You liked her parents.

467
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,073
Her dad's with
the federal security bank.

468
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,576
Is he? Hmm.

469
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,077
All right, but later on.

470
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,079
First, you need to get the dolls

471
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,581
out of the bath

472
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,583
and their arms out of the sink.

473
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,584
Ok.

474
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,586
See? What did I tell you?

475
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,087
She's made a friend already.

476
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,590
Just a matter of time.

477
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,103
Don't wait.

478
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,605
Can't I come in with you?

479
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,609
No. I'll look like a kid, ok?

480
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,611
All right.

481
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,114
I'll call you in a few hours.

482
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,117
Try to have fun, sweetheart.

483
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,122
Have a nice evening.

484
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,653
I'd give you a ride home,

485
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,154
but my tank's on empty.

486
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,156
I'm not surprised.

487
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,659
I'd rather bike.
It's just up the road.

488
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,162
Hey, Pam, when are you
gonna give me your number?

489
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,665
What do you need my number for?

490
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,667
You haven't got a phone.

491
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,169
No. But I got a quarter.

492
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,171
Lucky man.

493
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,172
So I'll see you around?

494
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,674
Right, sure.
Same time next week?

495
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,676
Um, maybe.

496
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,678
My schedule's kind of wacky,

497
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,180
but, um, I'll
drop by when I can.

498
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,682
Hey, I want to be
introduced to your mother...

499
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,184
And your father...

500
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,687
Any dogs, cats,
or canaries you live with.

501
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,688
Right.

502
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,190
I'll see you around.

503
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,472
I'm sure they'd love to meet me.

504
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,215
Hi.

505
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,733
What did it feel like
when you got shot?

506
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:41,736
What it's like getting shot.

507
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,266
Could you feel the bullet go in?

508
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,239
Don't remember.

509
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,744
I would have remembered
if it happened to me.

510
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,245
Ow!

511
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,748
Shit.

512
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,249
Got any whiskey?

513
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,752
It stings, but it
kills the germs.

514
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,254
No.

515
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:10,263
You're supposed to suck
the poison out, or you die.

516
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,265
What poison?

517
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,349
I read in a book on snakes.

518
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,272
A snake didn't bite me.

519
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:21,274
Then the next time one does,

520
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,277
you'll know what to do.

521
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,286
I'm not afraid of blood.

522
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,288
Every time they opened me up,

523
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,289
I lost a bathtubful.

524
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:40,293
How much blood did you
lose when you got shot?

525
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,295
I don't know.

526
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,798
Did you nearly die?

527
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:48,802
Yeah. I guess I did.

528
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,808
We was drinking,
me and Jeff, and we...

529
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,811
Run out of beer, pull
over at the 5 store,

530
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,814
and there's these 3 j-town cops

531
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,817
slurping on doughnuts
and coffee.

532
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:08,822
I know them, and they
sure know me, so...

533
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,324
I'm a-paying for my 12 of bud,

534
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:14,828
and I turn to the 3 of them,

535
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:19,072
and I let out this killer burp.

536
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,335
I mean, this son of a bitch
was loud as a shotgun.

537
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:25,338
Kind of ruined
their snack, I guess.

538
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,841
So 5 minutes later,
they pull us over.

539
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:31,345
Jeff gets scared.
He makes a run for it.

540
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,848
So now they think we
got something to hide.

541
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,849
And they're whacking me
with their sticks

542
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,851
until finally I was able
to punch one of them,

543
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:41,354
and I busted his nose,
and his buddy...

544
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,357
Aims his shotgun at me.

545
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:44,858
Bang bang.

546
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,360
You're dead.

547
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,363
Only I wasn't.

548
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,367
Wow.

549
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:57,872
What happened to Jeff?

550
00:40:58,322 --> 00:40:59,373
Mmm.

551
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,375
Jeff was ok.

552
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,878
He got, uh...

553
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,880
3 months. I got 6.

554
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,381
Boy, I tell you.

555
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,384
People say you're trash.

556
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:20,393
Yeah. I guess they do.

557
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,396
I wouldn't like that.

558
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,899
Well, you get used to it.

559
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,402
My father says
if everyone worked hard,

560
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,905
there wouldn't be
any poor people.

561
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:35,188
You're a poor person,
aren't you?

562
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:38,411
He says that anyone
who works hard can be rich,

563
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,914
just like him.

564
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,237
Sounds like you got
a smart daddy.

565
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:54,427
Trash is something you put
a lid on 'cause it stinks.

566
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:57,430
You don't smell that bad.

567
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,937
That makes my day.

568
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,948
The way I see it, you got
people who own lawns,

569
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,451
and you got people who mow them.

570
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,773
And they're never
the same people.

571
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,967
Ok, it's time for you
to get on home.

572
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:37,470
I told my mom I'd spend
the night at Tracy Keller's.

573
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,973
Do you know Tracy Keller?

574
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:40,975
No.

575
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:43,476
Neither do I.

576
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,480
Wait a minute.

577
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:49,482
So where do I sleep?

578
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:00,995
Go home.

579
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,997
No.

580
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,500
Get out of here.

581
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,502
Just go.

582
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,006
What the hell you want from me?

583
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:16,509
What?

584
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,511
Huh?

585
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:20,013
What?

586
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,017
Is that what you want?

587
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,019
You can have it.

588
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,521
Anything you want here,
it's yours. Take it.

589
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,523
Ok?

590
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,030
What's with you?

591
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:40,533
You curious? You just curious?

592
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:43,536
You got all that out there.

593
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:47,040
Everything out there is yours.

594
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:51,303
There's nothing here
for you, you understand?

595
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,546
Go home.

596
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,550
Go home.

597
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:58,130
Know where we can find
2 live chickens?

598
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:03,116
Why don't we just drive
to the supermarket?

599
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,617
They have to be fresh.

600
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:07,621
The ones at the supermarket
have been frozen for years.

601
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,122
Maybe longer.

602
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,124
You know,

603
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,624
stealing livestock's
a criminal offense.

604
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,126
We could go to jail.

605
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,128
We won't be stealing them.

606
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,130
We'll just be borrowing them.

607
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:20,134
And then we'll change
our minds and eat them.

608
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,636
Trust me.

609
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,148
Look, a chicken walk.

610
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:42,156
Uhh.

611
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:43,157
Shh.

612
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:46,659
They're trying to sleep.

613
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,177
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

614
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,184
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

615
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,189
Trent!

616
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,192
Trent, I caught one.

617
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,696
Looks like your luck's
changed, buddy.

618
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,700
Just a few more minutes
till the end of your life.

619
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,206
Um, Tracy's fine.

620
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:35,208
We're having chicken for dinner.

621
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,710
Well, um...

622
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:40,713
Her mom can't come
to the phone right now.

623
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,216
She's having a bath.

624
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,218
Got to go, mom.

625
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,720
Tracy's waving at me.

626
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,723
See ya. Love you.

627
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:51,225
Bye.

628
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,239
Do you think if we'd met
hundreds of years ago,

629
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,242
we'd still have
ended up as friends?

630
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:10,743
We're not friends.

631
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,247
We're hunters.

632
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,250
So who's gonna kill the meat?

633
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:22,256
You do yours,
and then I'll do mine.

634
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:24,758
Mmm. Do you know how?

635
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:25,875
Not yet.

636
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:49,782
If you promise never to
pull this one on me again,

637
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,785
I'll let you sleep over.

638
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,789
What you think your dad
would do if he found out?

639
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,292
He'd cut off my feet.

640
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:00,293
That's right.

641
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:04,596
And then he'd tie you
to a stake and burn you.

642
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,304
Baba Yaga bony legs,

643
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,807
his teeth made of steel,

644
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,809
and he can bite through trees,

645
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,312
and his legs are
like chicken legs.

646
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,316
Hey, who is this Baba Yaga?

647
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:25,818
A witch who lives in a forest.

648
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,821
No, I mean, what's this
monster stand for?

649
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,823
The moral of the story?

650
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,324
Yeah.

651
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,326
For whatever's bad, I guess.

652
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,829
Sometimes when it's dark,

653
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:40,333
Baba Yaga goes out into the field,

654
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,837
and a wild dog
comes to meet him.

655
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:48,342
And then a big, scary wind
starts to blow and blow.

656
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:52,345
Aieeee-ooooh!

657
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:55,849
Ay-ooooh!

658
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:59,853
Then Baba Yaga kills the dog
with his bare hands

659
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:01,855
and eats it.

660
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,358
Then Baba Yaga sings and dances,

661
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:09,461
his belly all full
of dog meat and blood.

00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,405
Do you know how the girl
escapes from Baba Yaga?

667
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,906
No.

668
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,409
A starving dog she fed

669
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:58,911
gives her a magic comb
and embroidered towel.

670
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:01,415
And the girl runs away
through the forest.

671
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,917
And when Baba Yaga almost has her,

672
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,419
the girl throws down the towel,

673
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,421
and a great river Springs up.

674
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,923
And Baba Yaga can't cross

675
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,926
till he drives his cows
to drink up all the water.

676
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:17,930
Look, I got to get up early, ok?

677
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:20,933
When Baba Yaga's at her heels,

678
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,935
the girl throws down the comb,

679
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:26,439
then a great forest
Springs up behind her.

680
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,442
The end, ok?

681
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,456
That's the third one

682
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,458
they got on your
street this week.

683
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,460
Someone is making fools of us.

684
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,462
I've been watching the lamps
in this neighborhood

685
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,464
at all hours, all hours.

686
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:55,527
I don't like it one bit.
We're insecure.

687
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,476
Aah!

688
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:06,979
Let's see some blood
on the sand!

689
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,983
Go on, bring the second squad!

690
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,485
Go on!

691
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,506
It won't take all day, will it?

692
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,008
It'll take as long as it takes.

693
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,510
Can I come?

694
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:38,512
I can help you.

695
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,514
I'll drop you off at the gate.

696
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:44,016
I can pull weeds.

697
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:47,019
No. But I'll make you a deal.

698
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,022
We can be friends

699
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,023
if you can keep it a secret.

700
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:55,004
What's wrong with you
and me being friends?

701
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:57,530
Well, for one thing,

702
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,533
I'm a country bumpkin, right?

703
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:03,536
I was born suckin'
on a bottle of rotgut,

704
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:08,541
and I'm a piss-poor,
retarded son of a bitch.

705
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,544
Do anything for a buck.

706
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:14,548
I slobber, and I spit.

707
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,048
And I...

708
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,049
Hey!

709
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,552
Fart. Pfft!

710
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,553
Put me down.

711
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,556
And I eat little
princesses like you

712
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:27,059
for breakfast! Arrgh!

713
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,570
I'm not a Princess.

714
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:41,774
No. Well, I'm still piss-poor.

715
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:46,018
Do you want me
to feel sorry for you?

716
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,581
Oh. I don't know.

717
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:51,584
Well, you can forget it.

718
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:57,089
Polish my golden slipper.

719
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,093
Yes, ma'am.

720
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:04,097
I'll Polish it so shiny,
I can see my face in it.

721
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:05,098
Yeah!

722
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,100
Yee-haw!

723
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:16,108
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

724
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,610
When I grow up?

725
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,612
I don't know.
I don't think about it.

726
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,615
Well, think about it.

727
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:24,116
Uh...

728
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,618
When I grow up...

729
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,121
Oh, I don't know.
I just want to be gone.

730
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,623
You know? Away from here.

731
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:31,624
And one day,

732
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,126
I'm gonna save up enough
money to do that, too,

733
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,128
and I'm gonna
put on a clean shirt

734
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,630
and a new pair of socks,

735
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:42,111
and I'm just gonna
walk out of this life.

736
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,136
I like how it sounds.

737
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:46,138
How what sounds?

738
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:50,643
Trent and Devon,
Devon and Trent.

739
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,144
Bullshit.

740
00:53:52,145 --> 00:54:00,145
Trent and Devon,
Devon and Trent.

741
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,171
When I was a kid,

742
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:22,675
mom and my old man
took me fishing here.

743
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,679
In those days,
you could catch 5 or...

744
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:29,181
6 big catfish. Big as your arm.

745
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,683
Then one night,

746
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,686
well, I just let
the 2 of them fish,

747
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,689
and then I walk a ways
down the bank,

748
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,691
and I take my shorts off,

749
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:41,194
and I plop myself
down on the sand

750
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:42,696
in my bare ass,

751
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,697
and I piss.

752
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:45,698
Yuck.

753
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,199
No! No!

754
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,201
There's nothing like the day

755
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,203
cooling all around you,

756
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:53,706
and you're sittin' in warm piss

757
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,207
with the river floating by.

758
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,209
Yuck again.

759
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,211
Yuck again?

760
00:54:58,712 --> 00:54:59,713
I was a kid.

761
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:01,715
Ok?

762
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:03,215
What you piss in

763
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:05,217

Did you have a good time, honey?

812
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:26,359
Brett put his hand
up my shirt yesterday.

813
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:27,360
At the barbecue?

814
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:28,861
What?

815
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:32,364
You let him put his hand
up your shirt?

816
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:34,867
No. He just did it.

817
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:39,010

his hand up your shirt?

818
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,875
Hmm. Is that all?

819
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:43,376
Nothing else?

820
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,377
I ran away.

821
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:46,879
Good for you.

822
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,881
That's my girl.

823
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,387
I had a good chat with
Brett's dad at the barbecue.

824
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,891
He's vice president
of maxitel Kentucky.

825
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,392
He told me he had a wild one
on his hands with that boy.

826
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:01,895
He was just tickling me.

827
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:05,898
Oh, honey, why didn't you
say so in the first place?

828
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,399
He was just playing.

829
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,904
Well, then he didn't
mean any harm, Dev.

830
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:14,406
You gave us a scare.

831
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,922
Can I be excused?

832
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,424
I don't feel well.

833
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,935
Do you think Brett
really upset her?

834
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,937
She's just growing up.

835
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,939
Well, she has her last
doctor's appointment

836
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:47,940
on Friday.

837
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:48,941
I still think

838
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,943
we should look into some
plastic surgery options.

839
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,945
She doesn't want it,
at least, not for now.

840
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,447
She'll want it
when she starts dating.

841
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,949
In a few years,

842
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:00,453
if a boy like Brett
feels that in the dark,

843
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:02,455
they won't be back for more.

844
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:05,457

00:59:11,931 --> 00:59:14,934
The guy just keeps on mowing.

849
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:17,937
Just mows and mows like...

850
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,439
Like it'll make a difference
in the world.

851
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,942
That man there isn't
just mowing lawns.

852
00:59:23,443 --> 00:59:24,943
He's got a plan.

853
00:59:24,944 --> 00:59:26,945
First our lawns, then our women.

854
00:59:26,946 --> 00:59:29,448
He's just waiting
to make his move.

855
00:59:29,449 --> 00:59:32,951
Jesus, Brett. That guy
really gets under your skin,

856
00:59:32,952 --> 00:59:33,952
doesn't he?

857
00:59:33,953 --> 00:59:36,955
How about we go to the mall

858
00:59:36,956 --> 00:59:39,458
and pick up some fresh sound?

859
00:59:39,459 --> 00:59:42,461
This stuff is stale.

860
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,968
Oh, looks like we're
running over Mexico there.

861
00:59:49,969 --> 00:59:52,471
El Salvador, estúpido!

862
00:59:52,472 --> 00:59:53,973
Viva México!

863
00:59:56,476 --> 00:59:59,479
Cortés lives, burrito breath!

864
01:00:33,513 --> 01:00:37,095
That was a smart move, kid.

865
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,519
Your go.

866
01:00:43,022 --> 01:00:44,523
That move, my friend,

867
01:00:44,524 --> 01:00:48,426
just cost you
another arm and a leg.

868
01:00:51,531 --> 01:00:53,031
All right, one more.

869
01:00:53,032 --> 01:00:58,396
But don't get too smart,
doll face.

870
01:00:58,538 --> 01:01:01,541
If you lose this time,

871
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:04,623
it will cost you your head.

Why would you do that?

877
01:01:22,562 --> 01:01:25,063
Because it's hot.

878
01:01:25,064 --> 01:01:28,567
Well, that would be considerate.

Oh, not one of
the nice glasses, honey.

Thanks, John. It's 92 degrees.

888
01:01:45,585 --> 01:01:48,086
I'm Theresa hall
with today's top local news

889
01:01:48,087 --> 01:01:50,589
on oldies 103 WRKA.

890
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:52,090
6 Kentucky businesses
are preparing

891
01:01:52,091 --> 01:01:54,092
for an overseas trade mission.

892
01:01:54,093 --> 01:01:56,094
Officials with the Kentucky
world trade center...

893
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:59,097
Hey, what's this? You got
something on your dress.

894
01:01:59,098 --> 01:02:00,098
Hey, hey.

895
01:02:00,099 --> 01:02:01,601
Whoa.

896
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:02,602
Hey. Trent, Trent.

897
01:02:02,603 --> 01:02:04,102
Hey, stop it.

898
01:02:04,103 --> 01:02:07,105
Hey. Hey, stop it.

899
01:02:07,106 --> 01:02:09,108
Hey, Trent. Trent, come on.

900
01:02:09,609 --> 01:02:10,610
Come on.

901
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:13,111
Come on, stop it.
What are you doing?

902
01:02:13,112 --> 01:02:17,175
Come here. I want to
show you something.

903
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,622
Uhh.

904
01:02:24,123 --> 01:02:25,123
Wow.

905
01:02:25,124 --> 01:02:27,125
Mmm.

906
01:02:28,127 --> 01:02:29,628
Where'd you get it?

907
01:02:29,629 --> 01:02:31,129
Almost ran over it
with the mower.

908
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:32,131
Turtle spaghetti.

909
01:02:32,465 --> 01:02:34,633
Ew.

910
01:02:35,134 --> 01:02:37,135

Oh. I got to go.

913
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:47,647
Ok.

914
01:02:47,648 --> 01:02:48,648

915
01:02:49,148 --> 01:02:51,149
Thanks.

916
01:03:03,162 --> 01:03:06,665
Uhh! Oh!

917
01:03:07,166 --> 01:03:10,168
Don't bite me.

918
01:03:28,187 --> 01:03:30,689
Hey, boy.

919
01:03:46,205 --> 01:03:48,206
What the hell?

920
01:04:00,553 --> 01:04:04,723
That son of a bitch.

921
01:04:10,229 --> 01:04:12,230
What if he didn't take the cds?

922
01:04:12,231 --> 01:04:13,732
He took 'em.

923
01:04:13,733 --> 01:04:15,734
Who do you think's been
taking the street lamps?

924
01:04:15,735 --> 01:04:17,736
What if it's his only mower?

925
01:04:17,737 --> 01:04:20,238
They always got a spare.

926
01:04:21,741 --> 01:04:23,742
Come on, let's go.

927
01:04:26,245 --> 01:04:28,747
He just gave me a turtle, mom.

928
01:04:28,748 --> 01:04:32,250
Oh, people don't
just give away turtles.

929
01:04:32,251 --> 01:04:35,373
Has he spoken to you before?

930
01:04:35,755 --> 01:04:37,256
Yes.

931
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:39,758
When?

932
01:04:43,763 --> 01:04:45,264
Listen to me, sweetheart.

933
01:04:45,765 --> 01:04:47,265
I'd rather you didn't
talk to him anymore.

934
01:04:47,266 --> 01:04:48,266
People don't
just give you things

935
01:04:48,267 --> 01:04:49,768
without wanting
something in return.

936
01:04:49,769 --> 01:04:50,769
The next thing you know,

937
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:52,772
he'll be asking
your father for a job.

938
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,273
He's got a job.

939
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,383
There's probably
something wrong with it.

940
01:05:39,819 --> 01:05:42,821
Looks like you got some
sugar in your gas tank.

941
01:05:42,822 --> 01:05:45,984
Now, how did you manage that?

942
01:05:47,827 --> 01:05:51,609
Sugar will ruin
a motor for sure.

943
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:55,834
Just a minute there, son.

944
01:05:55,835 --> 01:05:58,837
I got a call from a woman
that lives around here.

945
01:05:58,838 --> 01:06:01,340
She said you gave
her daughter a turtle.

946
01:06:01,841 --> 01:06:03,342
Is that right?

947
01:06:04,343 --> 01:06:06,846
Yeah. I gave a kid a turtle.

948
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:11,028
Now, why'd you go
and do a thing like that?

949
01:06:11,851 --> 01:06:15,854
Look, I like turtles.

950
01:06:15,855 --> 01:06:17,856
I used to go a-huntin' 'em
back up Harold's creek

951
01:06:17,857 --> 01:06:20,358
when I was a kid, but...

952
01:06:20,359 --> 01:06:22,360
Folks are nervous these days.

953
01:06:22,361 --> 01:06:25,865
It'd be best
if you kept to yourself

954
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:28,646
when you're working around here.

955
01:06:46,886 --> 01:06:47,887
How's it going?

956
01:06:48,387 --> 01:06:49,388
Mind if I get by here?

957
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:53,392
Hey. I've been meaning
to talk to you.

958
01:06:53,726 --> 01:06:55,393
It's about this lawn
my grandmother has.

959
01:06:55,394 --> 01:06:57,396
Only problem is
it's on her face.

960
01:06:58,397 --> 01:07:00,899
Think you can handle it?

961
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,905
That's a nice mower.

962
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,906
How's that running for you?

963
01:07:07,907 --> 01:07:09,408
Ok, now, uh...

964
01:07:09,909 --> 01:07:11,911
Get that car out of my way.

965
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:13,412
What's the rush?

966
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:18,335
We just got something we
need to work out is all.

967
01:07:18,417 --> 01:07:20,418
Boy, look at this.

968
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,921
This is ancient.

969
01:07:22,922 --> 01:07:24,923
I'll bet you could sell this
for an antique, huh?

970
01:07:24,924 --> 01:07:25,924
Don't touch it.

971
01:07:25,925 --> 01:07:27,926
Brett.

972
01:07:27,927 --> 01:07:28,927
Put it back.

973
01:07:28,928 --> 01:07:31,430
What's it feel like to play
with a 4-foot-long vibrator

974
01:07:31,931 --> 01:07:33,432
all day, huh?

975
01:07:37,937 --> 01:07:40,438
Hey, Sean,

976
01:07:40,439 --> 01:07:42,941
let's trim some weeds.

977
01:07:44,443 --> 01:07:46,945
If you took the music,
just give it back.

978
01:07:46,946 --> 01:07:47,946
There'll be no trouble.

979
01:07:47,947 --> 01:07:50,449
You owe us 4 cds, river rat.

980
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:52,390
What'd you do,
you sell them already?

981
01:07:52,451 --> 01:07:53,545
What the hell
are you talking about?

982
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,129
This is bullshit!
You want some of this?

983
01:07:55,204 --> 01:07:55,955
Brett!

984
01:07:55,956 --> 01:07:57,956
I'll cut you up, bitch!

985
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,967
Goddamn it, Brett!

986
01:08:09,969 --> 01:08:10,970
What are you, crazy?

987
01:08:17,476 --> 01:08:20,478
You're bleedin'.

988
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:23,481
What you want from me?

989
01:08:23,482 --> 01:08:24,482
Hmm?

990
01:08:24,483 --> 01:08:28,766
Well, what have you
got to offer?

991
01:08:37,997 --> 01:08:45,997
Get this fuckin' dog off of me!

992
01:08:54,013 --> 01:08:57,515
The punk bit me.

993
01:08:59,518 --> 01:09:01,019
Move my car.

994
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:02,020
Huh?

995
01:09:02,021 --> 01:09:04,522
Move it, damn it!

996
01:09:54,573 --> 01:09:56,574
Well...

997
01:09:57,076 --> 01:09:59,078
I could sell the truck...

998
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:02,080
To get a new mower,

999
01:10:02,081 --> 01:10:06,084
but then how am I going
to get the mower around?

1000
01:10:06,085 --> 01:10:07,586
I could sell the chain saw,

1001
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:09,087
and that might bring me enough

1002
01:10:09,088 --> 01:10:12,091
to buy a half-assed mower,

1003
01:10:12,591 --> 01:10:14,592
but then I'm going to be
mowing with a piece of shit,

1004
01:10:14,593 --> 01:10:18,573
and I'm going to be
out of a chain saw...

1005
01:10:18,597 --> 01:10:20,598
To do tree work.

1006
01:10:20,599 --> 01:10:22,600
So...

1007
01:10:23,602 --> 01:10:26,104
You know what?

1008
01:10:28,107 --> 01:10:31,149
Just fuck the whole thing.

1009
01:10:33,112 --> 01:10:35,113
Fuck it.

1010
01:11:36,175 --> 01:11:38,676
Where are we going?

1011
01:11:40,179 --> 01:11:42,180
Trent?

1012
01:11:58,697 --> 01:12:00,199
Ohh.

1013
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,201
Want to come in?

1014
01:12:04,203 --> 01:12:05,203
Hey, mama.

1015
01:12:05,204 --> 01:12:06,705
Hey.

1016
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:12,710
Hey, give me some sugar.

1017
01:12:13,212 --> 01:12:14,292
What happened to your face?

1018
01:12:14,713 --> 01:12:16,113
Oh, it's nothing.
I just scraped it.

1019
01:12:16,215 --> 01:12:17,215
What's this?

1020
01:12:17,216 --> 01:12:19,717
Oh, I cut myself
with the weed eater.

1021
01:12:19,718 --> 01:12:21,219
You want me to get you
a new bandage?

1022
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:22,720
No, it's... don't worry about it.

1023
01:12:22,721 --> 01:12:23,722
This is Devon, mama.

1024
01:12:24,223 --> 01:12:25,223
Oh.

1025
01:12:25,224 --> 01:12:27,226
Well, nice to meet you, Devon.

1026
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:28,727
You look tired.

1027
01:12:29,228 --> 01:12:30,228
Well...

1028
01:12:30,229 --> 01:12:32,230
Your daddy could keep
the whole county awake

1029
01:12:32,231 --> 01:12:35,433
with his wheezing and kicking.

1030
01:12:35,734 --> 01:12:36,734
He's out back.

1031
01:12:36,735 --> 01:12:38,736
Yeah?

1032
01:12:39,238 --> 01:12:40,238
You two look hot.

1033
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:43,241
You want some iced tea?

1034
01:12:44,243 --> 01:12:46,745
Well, I do.

1035
01:12:47,246 --> 01:12:53,370
Get us a couple of glasses
out of the cupboard, honey.

1036
01:12:56,255 --> 01:12:57,755
Get the nice ones...

1037
01:12:57,756 --> 01:13:00,258
The horse ones

1038
01:13:00,259 --> 01:13:03,261
for a change.

1039
01:13:04,263 --> 01:13:06,264
I hope you like it sweet.

1040
01:13:06,265 --> 01:13:09,268
Trent's daddy
likes it real sweet.

1041
01:13:14,773 --> 01:13:17,275
There you go.

1042
01:13:20,779 --> 01:13:23,781
Well, now.

1043
01:13:24,283 --> 01:13:25,283
How are you, dad?

1044
01:13:25,284 --> 01:13:26,285
Well...

1045
01:13:26,785 --> 01:13:28,786
I'm still here.

1046
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:33,792
I lost a mower today.

1047
01:13:34,793 --> 01:13:36,794
What, stolen?

1048
01:13:36,795 --> 01:13:39,298
No. Some kids put sugar
in the motor.

1049
01:13:39,798 --> 01:13:41,959
Well, why would they do that?

1050
01:13:42,801 --> 01:13:45,803
Because they like me.

1051
01:13:47,306 --> 01:13:50,308
Well, if you're worried
about us...

1052
01:13:50,309 --> 01:13:52,350
Is that why you come here?

1053
01:13:53,312 --> 01:13:57,315
Hey, you know we do
just fine on the pension.

1054
01:13:57,316 --> 01:13:58,817
What you send us is a treat...

1055
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:00,319
Something extra.

1056
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:04,323
So we'll do without the extras.

1057
01:14:04,823 --> 01:14:06,324
Hell, I can't bowl
no more anyways.

1058
01:14:06,325 --> 01:14:08,826
Sure, you can.

1059
01:14:08,827 --> 01:14:09,827
Now, listen...

1060
01:14:09,828 --> 01:14:13,331
No. Don't worry about it.

1061
01:14:20,339 --> 01:14:22,341
Hey, it's not so bad.

1062
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:25,343
No. No.

1063
01:14:33,852 --> 01:14:35,853
Not exactly.

1064
01:14:35,854 --> 01:14:37,856
It's more like yours goes...

1065
01:14:38,357 --> 01:14:40,358
dee-dum, dee-dum, dee-dum,

1066
01:14:40,359 --> 01:14:41,859
and mine goes...

1067
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:43,862
Diddy-dum, diddy-dum, diddy-dum.

1068
01:14:55,374 --> 01:15:00,557
I picked these up
during my years in Korea.

1069
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:02,880
Lots of guys
would sleep with them

1070
01:15:02,881 --> 01:15:06,043
under their pillows at night.

1071
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:08,886
And when a guy didn't come back,

1072
01:15:08,887 --> 01:15:12,390
well, I got his flag.

1073
01:15:17,896 --> 01:15:18,897
Take them.

1074
01:15:19,231 --> 01:15:20,898
No. I don't want them.

1075
01:15:20,899 --> 01:15:22,401
No. I want you to have them.

1076
01:15:23,402 --> 01:15:24,902
I don't want them.

1077
01:15:24,903 --> 01:15:25,903
I don't want them, dad.

1078
01:15:25,904 --> 01:15:29,987
God damn it, accept a gift!

1079
01:15:30,409 --> 01:15:33,590
I don't want them
around the house no more.

1080
01:15:35,414 --> 01:15:37,416
I can't bring myself
to throw them away.

1081
01:15:39,918 --> 01:15:40,918
Just when are you going to die

1082
01:15:40,919 --> 01:15:42,420
and get it over with, dad?

1083
01:15:42,421 --> 01:15:45,783
You've been doing it
for years now.

1084
01:15:45,924 --> 01:15:47,925
It takes a while to die.

1085
01:15:47,926 --> 01:15:49,927
You think I don't know that?

1086
01:15:49,928 --> 01:15:52,430
You think I don't know?

1087
01:15:52,431 --> 01:15:55,934
You and your fucking flags!

1088
01:15:56,935 --> 01:15:57,935
I don't want them.

1089
01:15:57,936 --> 01:16:00,438
Ok? Send them
to whatever bastards

1090
01:16:00,439 --> 01:16:02,940
send you your pension!

1091
01:16:09,448 --> 01:16:13,928
This one was always
my favorite back then.

1092
01:16:13,952 --> 01:16:15,453
Here.

1093
01:16:15,454 --> 01:16:18,456
Feel how soft it is.

1094
01:16:20,459 --> 01:16:22,960
Whose was this one?

1095
01:16:24,463 --> 01:16:26,964
It was mine.

Why is your father dying?

1109
01:17:32,531 --> 01:17:34,031
Is it because of the Koreans?

1110
01:17:34,032 --> 01:17:35,533
Did they torture him?

1111
01:17:35,534 --> 01:17:38,536
The Koreans didn't
fuck up my old man.

1112
01:17:38,537 --> 01:17:40,538
It was the canned cheese...

1113
01:17:40,539 --> 01:17:42,540
The government rations
the soldiers got.

1114
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:46,043
The cans had some sort
of bacteria in them, see?

1115
01:17:46,044 --> 01:17:48,546
Of course, the government
still denies it.

1116
01:17:48,547 --> 01:17:51,048
It gets inside you.

1117
01:17:51,049 --> 01:17:53,051
It lives in your lungs.
It eats them up

1118
01:17:53,552 --> 01:17:55,553
bit by bit.

1119
01:17:55,554 --> 01:17:57,555
He had one lung cut out...

1120
01:17:57,556 --> 01:18:00,057
Some years back.

1121
01:18:00,559 --> 01:18:03,562
He's got half of one left.

1122
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,565
You ever wonder how it'd be
to live on half a lung?

1123
01:18:11,069 --> 01:18:12,070
Gross.

1124
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,572
Do you want a cigarette?

1125
01:18:15,073 --> 01:18:17,575
Do you want some cola?

1126

1127
01:18:45,103 --> 01:18:47,605
So, what you want to show me?

1128
01:18:47,606 --> 01:18:50,107
We're best friends, right?

1129
01:18:50,108 --> 01:18:51,108
I don't know.

1130
01:18:51,109 --> 01:18:53,110
Yes, we are.

1131
01:18:53,111 --> 01:18:55,613
I don't know as I ever had
a best friend. I had...

1132
01:18:55,614 --> 01:18:57,115
You gave me a turtle.

1133
01:18:57,616 --> 01:18:59,617
Yeah, I did.

1134
01:19:00,235 --> 01:19:01,119
Then I'll show you.

1135
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,620
Whoa. No, no, stop that.

1136
01:19:02,621 --> 01:19:03,622
Aw, Jesus.

1137
01:19:04,122 --> 01:19:04,623
I want to.

1138
01:19:05,123 --> 01:19:07,124
Well, I don't want you to.

1139
01:19:07,125 --> 01:19:10,128
You're not old enough.

1140
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:16,353
It's not my tits I want
to show you, stupid.

1141
01:19:20,639 --> 01:19:22,640
Ok, I'm ready.

1142
01:19:23,141 --> 01:19:26,143
Come on, look.

1143
01:19:28,647 --> 01:19:31,649
Goddamn.

1144
01:19:33,652 --> 01:19:35,654
My dad can hardly look at it.

1145
01:19:36,154 --> 01:19:40,637
He says it gives him
the cold shivers.

1146
01:19:45,163 --> 01:19:46,163
Touch it.

1147
01:19:46,164 --> 01:19:47,665
No. No, thanks.

1148
01:19:47,666 --> 01:19:50,167
Go on.

1149
01:19:59,678 --> 01:20:01,679
See?

1150
01:20:05,684 --> 01:20:06,684
Huh.

1151
01:20:06,685 --> 01:20:10,187
That's cool.

1152
01:20:13,191 --> 01:20:15,192
Now I get to see yours.

1153
01:20:15,193 --> 01:20:17,194
Fair is fair.

1154
01:20:26,705 --> 01:20:27,706
Mine's bigger.

1155
01:20:28,206 --> 01:20:29,207
Yeah.

1156
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,710
Can I touch it?

1157
01:20:45,724 --> 01:20:47,725
It's tracker.

1158
01:20:47,726 --> 01:20:49,727
He's loose.

1159
01:20:51,730 --> 01:20:54,231
Let's catch him.

1160
01:21:04,743 --> 01:21:07,244
Tracker!

1161
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,749
Come here, boy!

1162
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:25,045
Tracker!

1163
01:21:38,276 --> 01:21:39,276
Stay in the car.

1164
01:21:39,277 --> 01:21:41,779
But he's hurt.

1165
01:21:43,281 --> 01:21:46,784
I said stay in the car.

1166
01:21:51,289 --> 01:21:55,732
If he's hurt,
we'll take care of him.

1167
01:21:57,796 --> 01:21:58,796
Is he all right?

1168
01:21:58,797 --> 01:22:00,798
No...

1169
01:22:00,799 --> 01:22:02,801
He's not. He's hurt bad.

1170
01:22:03,802 --> 01:22:05,303
We'll take him to the vet.

1171
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:09,283
I want you to cover
your eyes, ok, buddy?

1172
01:22:09,307 --> 01:22:10,307
Why?

1173
01:22:10,308 --> 01:22:14,711
God damn it, I said
cover your eyes.

1174
01:22:56,354 --> 01:22:57,856
Devon?

1175
01:22:58,356 --> 01:22:59,857
Devon, what happened?

1176
01:22:59,858 --> 01:23:01,859
Devon, what is it?

1177
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:03,360
Devon?

1178
01:23:03,361 --> 01:23:05,863
Oh, my god.

1179
01:23:13,872 --> 01:23:16,874
I said I don't know!

1180
01:23:17,876 --> 01:23:20,377
Just come home.

1181
01:23:31,890 --> 01:23:33,892
Did somebody hurt you, honey?

1182
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,894
He didn't hurt me.

1183
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:38,512
Who didn't?

1184
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,398
Trent.

1185
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:41,899
Oh, my god.

1186
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:42,900
Trent?

1187
01:23:42,901 --> 01:23:44,401
The man who mows our lawns...

1188
01:23:44,402 --> 01:23:47,184
The one who gave her the turtle.

1189
01:23:47,405 --> 01:23:49,407
Tell me about Trent, honey.

1190
01:23:50,408 --> 01:23:52,910
Did he touch you?

1191
01:23:56,414 --> 01:24:00,477
No one's going to
blame you, sweetheart.

1192
01:24:17,435 --> 01:24:19,937
I'll call Nash.

1193
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:22,941
Christ.

1194
01:24:26,945 --> 01:24:28,946
Devon,

1195
01:24:28,947 --> 01:24:31,448
this is important.

1196
01:24:31,449 --> 01:24:33,690
Did Trent touch you in any way?

1197
01:24:35,954 --> 01:24:37,454
Yes...

1198
01:24:37,455 --> 01:24:38,956
But it was only because...

1199
01:24:38,957 --> 01:24:40,958
I'll kill the punk.

1200
01:24:44,462 --> 01:24:44,963
Where did he touch you, honey?

1201
01:24:45,463 --> 01:24:46,464
Show me where.

1202
01:24:47,465 --> 01:24:49,967
I let him see...

1203
01:24:49,968 --> 01:24:51,969
My...

1204
01:24:52,971 --> 01:24:55,973
He touched my...

1205
01:24:56,474 --> 01:24:57,554
Take your time, sweetheart.

1206
01:24:57,976 --> 01:24:59,476
We're listening.

1207
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,479
He touched my scar.

1208
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,481
Oh, Christ.

1209
01:25:04,482 --> 01:25:07,985
He thought it was cool.

1210
01:25:08,987 --> 01:25:11,488
And I touched him, too,

1211
01:25:11,489 --> 01:25:12,991
where he was shot.

1212
01:25:13,992 --> 01:25:16,994
We were friends.

1213
01:25:18,997 --> 01:25:20,498
Secret friends.

1214
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:23,500
Oh, god.

1215
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,504
But then he killed the dog.

1216
01:25:27,005 --> 01:25:29,006
I hate him.

1217
01:25:29,507 --> 01:25:31,009
Was it yours?

1218
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,010
Yeah.

1219
01:25:33,011 --> 01:25:35,012
You know where he lives?

1220
01:25:35,013 --> 01:25:37,014
I'll, by god, find out.

1221
01:25:37,015 --> 01:25:38,516
He's got to be just up the road.

1222
01:25:39,017 --> 01:25:41,018
All right, you better stay
here with Mrs. Stockard.

1223
01:25:41,019 --> 01:25:42,519
You stay with me, sweetheart.

1224
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:44,521
Dad...

1225
01:25:46,024 --> 01:25:49,026
I know where he lives.

1226
01:26:09,547 --> 01:26:11,548
We'll try further up.

1227
01:26:11,549 --> 01:26:13,051
Right.

1228
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:16,173
That was a big help.

1229
01:26:26,314 --> 01:26:28,565
Is this the road?

1230
01:26:30,068 --> 01:26:32,069
Bingo.

1231
01:27:00,598 --> 01:27:03,600
Stay in the car, Dev!

1232
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,104
I warned you, Mr. burns.

1233
01:27:07,105 --> 01:27:08,265
This here's private property.

1234
01:27:08,606 --> 01:27:10,107
No. This is state property,

1235
01:27:10,108 --> 01:27:13,610
and you and that tin can
are trespassing.

1236
01:27:13,611 --> 01:27:15,612
What you want?

1237
01:27:15,613 --> 01:27:16,613
We're looking for a dog.

1238
01:27:16,614 --> 01:27:19,116
You seen one?

1239
01:27:19,617 --> 01:27:22,596
You ain't no real cop.
I don't have to talk to you.

1240
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:24,621
A big dog.

1241
01:27:24,622 --> 01:27:26,123
Doberman.

1242
01:27:26,124 --> 01:27:28,126
Wore a chain-link collar.

1243
01:27:28,626 --> 01:27:30,127
This here is his owner.

1244
01:27:30,128 --> 01:27:31,128
I'll tell you what...

1245
01:27:31,129 --> 01:27:33,131
Why don't you all go to hell?

1246
01:27:34,632 --> 01:27:36,192
He's got a sense
of respect, doesn't he?

1247
01:27:36,384 --> 01:27:38,135
Uhh!

1248
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:40,138
I may not be a real cop anymore,

1249
01:27:40,638 --> 01:27:44,301
but I can still act like one.

1250
01:27:44,642 --> 01:27:46,644
I loved that dog.

1251
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:48,146
You touch my daughter?

1252
01:27:48,646 --> 01:27:49,646
What? Huh?

1253
01:27:49,647 --> 01:27:51,648
Is that the hand you used
to touch her?

1254
01:27:51,649 --> 01:27:53,650
She's 10 years old,

1255
01:27:53,651 --> 01:27:56,153
you piece of shit.

1256
01:28:09,667 --> 01:28:14,350
A girl like Devon
will never belong to you.

1257
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:24,181
Uhh!

1258
01:28:24,182 --> 01:28:25,682
I think that's enough.

1259
01:28:25,683 --> 01:28:27,184
Yeah?

1260
01:28:27,185 --> 01:28:28,685
Just about.

1261
01:28:28,686 --> 01:28:30,187
Here.

1262
01:28:30,188 --> 01:28:31,688
Take a crack at him.

1263
01:28:31,689 --> 01:28:32,689
Morton.

1264
01:28:32,690 --> 01:28:34,691
Stay out of this, Nash.

1265
01:28:34,692 --> 01:28:36,193
This is a personal situation.

1266
01:28:36,194 --> 01:28:38,695
I said that's enough!

1267
01:28:41,699 --> 01:28:44,201
Do it.

1268
01:28:45,703 --> 01:28:48,205
Hit him!

1269
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:56,713
Oh, Jesus.

1270
01:29:02,553 --> 01:29:04,721
Trent.

1271
01:29:06,224 --> 01:29:08,725
Trent. Shit.

1272
01:29:08,726 --> 01:29:09,806
Get up. You have to get up.

1273
01:29:10,228 --> 01:29:11,728
Shit, Devon.

1274
01:29:11,729 --> 01:29:13,730
Jesus Christ, you shot him.

1275
01:29:13,731 --> 01:29:16,733
Honey, give me the gun.

1276
01:29:17,235 --> 01:29:18,236
Stop.

1277
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,237
He's bleeding, Devon.
He's bleeding bad.

1278
01:29:20,238 --> 01:29:21,739
We got to get him to a hospital,

1279
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:22,740
or he'll bleed to death.

1280
01:29:22,741 --> 01:29:24,241
He won't die. I lost bucketsful,

1281
01:29:24,242 --> 01:29:26,243
and I didn't die.

1282
01:29:26,244 --> 01:29:28,745
They're going to
pin this on me, Devon.

1283
01:29:28,746 --> 01:29:29,746
They're going...

1284
01:29:29,747 --> 01:29:32,249
They're going to pin
this on me, you hear me?

1285
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,250
They won't.

1286
01:29:33,251 --> 01:29:34,751
They're going to kill me, Devon.

1287
01:29:34,752 --> 01:29:35,752
You understand?

1288
01:29:35,753 --> 01:29:38,255
Not if you go, Trent.

1289
01:29:38,256 --> 01:29:40,758
You have to get out
from here now.

1290
01:29:44,262 --> 01:29:46,263
Go.

1291
01:29:47,765 --> 01:29:49,766
Go.

1292
01:29:53,271 --> 01:29:55,272
Ok.

1293
01:30:10,288 --> 01:30:12,290
Dev.

1294
01:30:12,623 --> 01:30:14,791
Aw, Dev.

1295
01:30:17,295 --> 01:30:19,296
Give me your wallet.

1296
01:30:19,297 --> 01:30:21,799
Give me your wallet,
dad, or I'll shoot you.

1297
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,301
Better do what she says,
Mr. Stockard,

1298
01:30:24,302 --> 01:30:28,545
or I believe shewill shoot you.

1299
01:30:36,814 --> 01:30:37,815
Here. No.

1300
01:30:38,316 --> 01:30:41,318
Buy a new shirt.
There's blood on yours.

1301
01:30:41,319 --> 01:30:44,321
Here. Hold the gun.

1302
01:30:47,825 --> 01:30:48,825
We've slowed the bleeding,

1303
01:30:48,826 --> 01:30:50,828
but we have to get him
to a hospital.

1304
01:30:51,329 --> 01:30:52,829
Morton?

1305
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:54,831
Morton.

1306
01:31:16,854 --> 01:31:19,356
They're going to come after you.

1307
01:31:19,357 --> 01:31:21,358
When they get close,

1308
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:23,860
throw down this towel.

1309
01:31:24,362 --> 01:31:27,364
If they're still gaining on you,

1310
01:31:27,365 --> 01:31:29,867
throw down this comb.

1311
01:31:31,369 --> 01:31:36,052
Whatever happened
at the end of that story?

1312
01:31:38,876 --> 01:31:41,378
The girl got away.

1313
01:31:41,879 --> 01:31:44,881
She ran and she ran
until she was home.

1314
01:31:44,882 --> 01:31:46,883
Home.

1315
01:31:47,385 --> 01:31:51,748
Yeah. Tell me
where that is, Devon.

1316
01:31:58,896 --> 01:32:02,399
Home is in my hands.

1317
01:32:06,904 --> 01:32:08,405
Now drive fast.

1318
01:32:08,406 --> 01:32:10,907
Fast.

1319
01:32:53,951 --> 01:32:54,951
Dev...

1320
01:32:54,952 --> 01:32:55,952
Honey...

1321
01:32:55,953 --> 01:32:58,455
Get on your knees, dad.

1322
01:32:58,456 --> 01:33:00,457
You're just scared, honey.

1323
01:33:00,458 --> 01:33:01,778
I'll tell them
it was an accident.

1324
01:33:01,959 --> 01:33:04,461
Kneel down.

1325
01:33:14,472 --> 01:33:17,474
Stand up slowly.

1326
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:35,992
Walk straight.

1327
01:33:41,999 --> 01:33:44,000
Stop.

1328
01:34:05,523 --> 01:34:09,526
Yes, I need ems
for a gunshot victim.

1329
01:34:09,527 --> 01:34:12,506
The wound is in
the lower right abdomen.

1330
01:34:12,530 --> 01:34:14,531
Once upon a time,

1331
01:34:14,532 --> 01:34:17,534
in the middle
of a big, dark forest,

1332
01:34:17,535 --> 01:34:20,537
there lived a boy

1333
01:34:20,538 --> 01:34:21,539
in a house

1334
01:34:21,872 --> 01:34:23,040
all alone.

1335
01:34:24,041 --> 01:34:26,543
And he took care of the trees

1336
01:34:26,544 --> 01:34:30,046
and fed a stray girl
and was kind to her,

1337
01:34:30,047 --> 01:34:33,049
and she loved him for it.

1338
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:34,551
But one day,

1339
01:34:34,552 --> 01:34:37,555
Baba Yaga entered the forest
to eat the boy.

1340
01:34:38,556 --> 01:34:40,557
The boy wanted to run,

1341
01:34:40,558 --> 01:34:46,602
but he knew he could never
outrun Baba Yaga bony legs.

1342
01:34:48,182 --> 01:34:50,066
The girl said to the boy,

1343
01:34:50,067 --> 01:34:53,069
"take this magic comb
and embroidered towel

1344
01:34:53,070 --> 01:34:55,572
and run."

1345
01:34:55,906 --> 01:34:57,574
"When Baba Yaga chases you,

1346
01:34:57,575 --> 01:35:00,577
"throw down the towel,

1347
01:35:00,578 --> 01:35:03,079
"and a great river
will rise up behind you

1348
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:06,583
and cover your tracks."

1349
01:35:36,113 --> 01:35:39,515
"If Baba Yaga
is still chasing you..."

1350
01:35:39,617 --> 01:35:42,118
"Throw down the magic comb,

1351
01:35:42,119 --> 01:35:46,682
and a forest
will spring up behind you."

1352
01:36:03,641 --> 01:36:07,644
And the boy drove on and on,

1353
01:36:07,645 --> 01:36:09,146
never coming back...

1354
01:36:10,147 --> 01:36:13,650
Safe at last.
