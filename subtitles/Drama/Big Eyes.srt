2
00:01:52,431 --> 00:01:53,363
If you were a man

3
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:57,364
I'm Dick Nolan and invention  
things for a living 
I'm a reporter

4
00:02:11,984 --> 00:02:14,612
It is the strangest story  
you have covered

5
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:18,350
He started the day that Margaret Ulbrich  
she left her husband quencher

6
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,956
And it seemed the best thing to do

7
00:02:22,795 --> 00:02:23,727
Let Jane

8
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:12,203
honey 
You did it!

9
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:15,835
Are you here! 
#Look at you now

10
00:04:16,074 --> 00:04:18,402
DeeAnn 
DeeAnn  -- I know

11
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,579
But I had to adapt and not use  
a name that my mother would call me

12
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:24,980
So you're excited  
for all this? 
#You've established?  How about this Jane?

13
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,514
Jane is fine, is going  
a little sweet school

14
00:04:27,786 --> 00:04:29,913
You know, it's really difficult without  
his father and all that

15
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:33,489
Do not know if we can ,,,  
-- Come 
These better so

16
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:35,719
Between us never fall me  
While Frank

17
00:04:35,994 --> 00:04:39,054
You were a bridesmaid  
-- Exactly, so I could not say anything

18
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:43,999
But if I see him around again  
I'll tell 
Now come on, you have to have fun

19
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,667
To go to Hungry Eye Jazz 
For Italian food  Vanezi

20
00:04:47,906 --> 00:04:51,134
For salvation try  
Buddhist temple 
For art gallery Sixth

21
00:04:52,444 --> 00:04:54,837
Only show modern art? 
#All show only  modern art

22
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:58,143
And in the basement are expressly 
I express that is?  I have no idea

23
00:04:58,584 --> 00:04:59,744
You have much to learn

24
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:15,399
Back then women  
they did not leave 
Not without a job or prospects

25
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:19,897
All she had was her  
paintings in the trunk 
And his daughter in the backseat

26
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:22,099
good luck

27
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:35,281
We receive many ladies here

28
00:05:36,488 --> 00:05:38,115
Then your husband approves you work?

29
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,050
My husband and I are separated

30
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:44,027
Separated?

31
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:50,563
I realize that I have not  
work experience

32
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:55,606
but really 
I need this job have a  daughter support

33
00:05:57,676 --> 00:06:01,308
I'm not very good convincing but  
if I like painting 
If I could

34
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,740
Show my portfolio

35
00:06:04,116 --> 00:06:07,509
study in 
The Art Institute Watkins  Nashville

36
00:06:08,186 --> 00:06:10,987
I did some illustrations 
Classes in New York, this is ,,,

37
00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:13,423
A cake I made

38
00:06:14,826 --> 00:06:19,120
And ,,, 
This is a portrait coal

39
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:22,524
If you understand that this is a  
furniture company?

40
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:09,542
They are very nice  
-- Yes 
Your equipment is adorable

41
00:07:10,048 --> 00:07:11,808
Thank You 
How much?

42
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:13,813
For the special $ 2

43
00:07:15,053 --> 00:07:15,883
I'll give you one

All Right

46
00:07:25,864 --> 00:07:27,896
And how old are you? 
#I am 9 years

47
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:29,657

00:07:42,147 --> 00:07:47,146

Reach out more 
Come on, good!

50

They want to touch it? 
#Let

51
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:04,433
Come on, do it! 
#Do not worry do not break

52
00:08:06,905 --> 00:08:08,031
Worth $ 35

53
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:11,733
Excuse me a second?

54
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:22,715
Here  
-- Thank You 
Thank You

55
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:30,651
Worth more than the change 
You should sell  so cheap

56
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:32,426
Well I'm just glad  
he liked

57
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:37,658
You passed that point 
Your heart is in your work

58
00:08:40,572 --> 00:08:41,300
What's your name?

59
00:08:43,842 --> 00:08:44,638
Margaret

60
00:08:46,645 --> 00:08:51,612
But not you rather flirt  
those girls over there? 
#No, I likes you Margaret

61
00:08:53,051 --> 00:08:53,915
Ulbrich

62
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,089
You know Margaret Ulbrich? 
#You're underestimating

63
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:01,382
Let me show you how it's done

64
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:05,228
little girl

65
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:10,901
You would have them do your portrait the  
world famous Margaret Ulbrich

66
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:15,431
Queen of the Bay 
In mere minutes capture your soul

67
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:20,502
Do Not 
Dont you wish you were your  in this beautiful painting?

68
00:09:21,012 --> 00:09:23,214
That's me 
And that's me

69
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:27,212
And that I was until my mom  
He became a Chinese boy

70
00:09:29,254 --> 00:09:32,389
my apologies 
I did not understand the situation

71
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:37,662
Well I better go before Mr, Ulbrich  
come and hit me in the eye

72
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,426
Mr, Ulbrich is no longer in the image

73
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:52,706
Good night, Henry

74
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:58,247
Sorry for not calling to book 
Lucky I have a table list,  madame

75
00:09:58,483 --> 00:10:01,846
Good evening, welcome 
Plz follow me

76
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:06,885
And do I have to pay a dime because  
I gave the chef a painting

77
00:10:07,092 --> 00:10:08,320
You know what he said?  
-- What?

78
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,621
He said nobody paints my country  
as the great Walter Keane

79
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:17,994
I can not believe you  
lived in Paris

80
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:22,502
The best time of my life

81
00:10:25,277 --> 00:10:26,608
I've never been on a plane

82
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:31,141
You have to experiment  
these things 
You have to catch them

83
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,946
I wanted to be an artist so 
I went alone

84
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,615
I studied painting there 
I lived in a studio

85
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,352
I survived on bread and wine 
You're a romantic

86
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,754
Yes, I am!

87
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:48,589
Of course go there  
was not easy

88
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:50,635
I had to quit my job

89
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:54,034
Leaving my wife

90
00:10:56,508 --> 00:10:58,464
Yes 
these decisions  are not easy

91
00:11:01,112 --> 00:11:02,374
I have never acted  
freely

92
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:05,973
I was a child and then  
a wife and then a mother

93
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:13,184
All my paintings are Jane  
because she's all I know 
Do not belittle your work

94
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:15,052
Have an amazing talent

95
00:11:16,494 --> 00:11:21,354
You can see someone and capture  
on your canvas 
You can paint people

96
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:26,628
I can only paint things 
I mean, my streets are ,,,

97
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:30,332
lovely 
But at the end of the day

98
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:32,567
They are just a collection of buildings  
and sidewalks

99
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:37,107
Walter, I bet you can  
paint whatever

100
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:43,912
When you look at me so 
You could fall in love strongly

101
00:11:51,229 --> 00:11:52,059
Sorry

102
00:11:53,398 --> 00:11:54,695
This goes really fast

103
00:11:58,103 --> 00:11:59,297
I have not been on a date  
in a while

104
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,043
Jane, honey, stop moving

105
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:17,652
Mother after all this time must  
know how my face looks

106
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,086
Hey, your canvas is blank 
You can not rush inspiration

107
00:12:27,465 --> 00:12:31,799
Do not bother Mr, Keane creativity  
comes from within 
Do not worry

108
00:12:32,103 --> 00:12:33,127
She does not bother me

109
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:45,641
I can ask you a question?

110
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:48,750
What about the large  
and crazy eyes?

111
00:12:49,788 --> 00:12:53,317
Oh 
Well, I think you can see things

112
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:57,555
Eye 
The eyes are the window  soul

113
00:12:58,763 --> 00:13:03,492
Yes but 
The pints in a way very  out of proportion

114
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:07,730
Okay 
The eyes are like Express  my emotions

115
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:10,133
I have always painted well

116
00:13:11,476 --> 00:13:14,343
When I was little I had surgery  
I leave me deaf for a while and

117
00:13:14,612 --> 00:13:17,540
I could not hear so 
I stared

118
00:13:18,383 --> 00:13:20,442
Trust the eyes of people

119
00:13:21,686 --> 00:13:24,812
Walter? 
#Hey, Walt, I thought it was you!

120
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:27,285
I'm glad to see you

121
00:13:33,098 --> 00:13:35,631
Hear about permissions  
for Thursday 
Yes? excellent

122
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:38,166
I'll architects 
Ok

123
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:44,037
What was that?

124
00:13:50,849 --> 00:13:52,316
I did not want you to know

125
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:56,117
I am in commercial property

126
00:13:58,156 --> 00:14:00,654
You're a real estate agent? 
#Yes

127
00:14:02,393 --> 00:14:07,296
I am a successful agent, the top of the  
office, 3 years on the job

128
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:09,490
And you ashamed?

129
00:14:12,003 --> 00:14:13,903
Any fool can fix  
a sublet

130
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,571
Everything I've ever wanted is  
keep me as an artist

131
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:24,713
I tried to start from scratch 
But I did not succeed

132
00:14:27,318 --> 00:14:28,945
I'm just a Sunday painter

133
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:44,835
Thank You 
Sign in here

134
00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:49,132
Put it here

135
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:54,470
Here?  
-- If there is great 
I would like that is not  in the way

136
00:14:56,214 --> 00:14:59,779
namely 
In something I'm working

137
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:04,449
You can see 
I'm working ,,,

138
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:29,574
hello

139
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:50,465
What happens?

140
00:15:53,238 --> 00:15:54,603
Frank wants to take Jane

141
00:15:55,907 --> 00:15:58,805
He says I'm not a proper mother 
And ,,,  -- You're perfect

142
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,646
He told the court that

143
00:16:04,182 --> 00:16:08,848
She lacks a suitable house 
And that is beyond my  capabilities

144
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,746
As a single mother 
Will you marry me?

145
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,364
Do not think of a reason  
to say no

146
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,964
Because I have a million reasons  
to say that if

147
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:26,997
I know it makes no sense

148
00:16:28,873 --> 00:16:30,807
But think how much  
enjoy ourselves

149
00:16:31,776 --> 00:16:33,971
And I will cherish, girls

150
00:16:39,217 --> 00:16:41,079
Margaret 
I'm on one knee

151
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:43,843
Come on, you say? 
#Let's get married

152
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:48,289
We could be in Hawaii  
the weekend 
Oh, Hawaii, marriage

153
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:53,321
I do not know Walter I'm crazy about you  
but I am very overwhelmed

154
00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:57,024
Why we would go to Hawaii? 
#Because you're a princess

155
00:16:57,302 --> 00:16:59,361
And you deserve to get married in paradise

156
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:22,992
You were right 
It's paradise

157
00:17:24,228 --> 00:17:27,927
Only God could create these colors 
I told you!

158
00:17:29,934 --> 00:17:31,265
We can not stay here  
forever?

159
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,199
I do not know if forever

160
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:37,138
But I guess I could  
Fix a week

161
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:19,172
There was a waterfall and the air was  
so fresh you could taste

162
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,243
And this was an ancient altar

163
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,616
That is a statue of Kane  
the god of creation

164
00:18:27,158 --> 00:18:28,557
I prayed

165
00:18:30,128 --> 00:18:32,756
Those are Walter and Jane built  
the sandcastle together

166
00:18:34,532 --> 00:18:36,227
Well, this happens  
very fast

167
00:18:36,868 --> 00:18:39,735
In the time you moved here  
I have been on 2 appointments and you and you married

168
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:43,666
Well I guess there was a gap in  
Walter filled my life

169
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:47,972
Walter has filled many things 
It's got all the skirts  art

170
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,940
You're talking about my husband 
I know, why I mentioned

171
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:54,442
I'm not naive

172
00:18:57,422 --> 00:18:59,251
I am naive but 
I know who I married

173
00:19:00,158 --> 00:19:03,818
Walter can be impulsive but  
It is a good provider 
Yes wonderful with Jane

174
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:07,762
I'm just looking to start from scratch,  
I am a divorcee with a girl

175
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:09,965
Walter is a blessing

176
00:19:13,438 --> 00:19:14,336
Thank You

177
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:30,948
These on the threshold of incredible success

178
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,581
The theme of the composition is  
spontaneity

179
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:39,988
The image has no center  
visual attention 
It is very gestural  -- Definitely

180
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:41,731
Heavily influenced by Tashes

181
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,331
Listen to a famous was  
here looking 
Well, I'm not allowed to say

182
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,415
Christ 
Do not go here right now  please

183
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:01,916
Ruben 
good Morning

184
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:05,981
You have a moment? 
#Walter, you're missing the word, quote

185
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:07,923
I can come back later

186
00:20:09,393 --> 00:20:11,657
You'll love my stuff today

187
00:20:16,067 --> 00:20:17,295
I have not seen that before?

188
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:22,432
No that was painted at 5

189
00:20:22,707 --> 00:20:27,240
This is the 6th Street 
I do not understand, you lived in Paris  for a week

190
00:20:27,445 --> 00:20:30,238
As you can continue taking  
paintings? 
#Everything is here

191
00:20:30,448 --> 00:20:31,380
And here

192
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,714
Well it will not go up here 
Walter know you do not go  these representations

193
00:20:36,921 --> 00:20:40,013
You are very literal 
Art is a fashion  -- If it is

194
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:44,055
People want Kandinsky  
or Rafko 
They do not want

195
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:45,553
Street scenes

196
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,155
How about this?

197
00:21:01,612 --> 00:21:03,443
My God you've come  
to a new period

198
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:07,706
Do Not 
They are from my wife

199
00:21:11,622 --> 00:21:12,714
Why your eyes are so big?

200
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:17,119
As large gumdrops  
and quiet 
It's expressionism

201
00:21:17,628 --> 00:21:19,118
Surely you recognize

202
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:23,466
Well, I'm glad that  
have been found

203
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:28,301
Then you say 
I say no, it is not art

204
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:32,502
It is not art? 
#I paint for a magazine,  you know the turtle draws

205
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,439
Win a contest 
How dare you? A lot  People you may like

206
00:21:35,713 --> 00:21:37,908
If someone but not  
enters through

207
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:41,183
Now please clean this before  
good taste police come

208
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,764
It is a secret society of owners  
galleries and critics

209
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:08,974
We will meet on Sunday  
to eat something 
And recite what is great

210
00:22:09,714 --> 00:22:11,113
As at hearings  
McCarthy

211
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:16,653
I point to this painter  
I exiling that painter 
There is no man's land

212
00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:20,755
I think people buy  
art that touches

213
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:23,651
If you live in a fairy tale

214
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:26,995
People unable to discover anything

215
00:22:27,531 --> 00:22:30,022
Buy art because it is in the  
time and place indicated

216
00:22:33,838 --> 00:22:36,033
Ok, a welcome to Cal Jader

217
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:43,277
Well, sure to stay  
for the show's 1:00 a,m,

218
00:22:51,188 --> 00:22:52,314
Enjoy, enjoy

219
00:22:54,225 --> 00:22:58,556
apology 
Hey I love Banducci  music tonight

220
00:22:58,796 --> 00:23:01,993
this brilliant  
-- Thank you, thank 
Walter Keane

221
00:23:02,233 --> 00:23:03,165
I am a painter

222
00:23:04,702 --> 00:23:07,798
I was watching your walls 
They are very empty

223
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,702
Maybe you're right 
What color would seem like good?

224
00:23:12,276 --> 00:23:16,310
No, no 
I am an artist, used to live in Paris

225
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,107
Now I have moved to  
USA 
And I look ,,,

226
00:23:22,153 --> 00:23:25,249
An exhibition debut 
I like my club as is

227
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:28,657
If your stuff is so good  
sees it in a museum

228
00:23:30,194 --> 00:23:33,385
I respect that you are a  
businessman 
Not a charity

229
00:23:34,198 --> 00:23:37,731
such 
If I rent your walls?

230
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:02,989
Walter, Margaret? 
#Ready?

231
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,806
An art lover 
Beautiful, that I can do  for you sir?

232
00:24:20,644 --> 00:24:21,668
Just looking for the bathroom

233
00:24:24,048 --> 00:24:24,912
Thank You

234
00:25:01,485 --> 00:25:02,679
Look at that girl

235
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:05,888
This sad

236
00:25:07,224 --> 00:25:10,017
It is poor? 
#It has been forgotten

237
00:25:11,095 --> 00:25:12,824
Makes me want to mourn

238
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:19,596
You're Keane? 
#Yes, I am

239
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,628
You're a great painter

240
00:25:22,873 --> 00:25:24,898
Thank you, thank you very much

241
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,707
Your work is very powerful

242
00:25:29,146 --> 00:25:31,580
There are so many emotions  
in those eyes

243
00:25:35,052 --> 00:25:35,950
Is something wrong?

244
00:25:37,221 --> 00:25:41,051
Do Not 
I did not realize you were talking  the picture of my wife

245
00:25:41,258 --> 00:25:45,823
Oh I get it 
The artist does not want to get rid  your favorite piece

246
00:25:46,664 --> 00:25:49,192
Oh honey, thanks 
I love him

247
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:53,133
I had not delayed

248
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,379
Hey Picasso 
Good place no?

249
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,220
Thanks for that closet  
where I put brooms

250
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:17,089
Are you talking about? It's just 
When people drink have  to relieve themselves

251
00:26:17,628 --> 00:26:20,320
It is insulting 
When people see art not  should think about defecating

252
00:26:20,865 --> 00:26:24,261
Hey, careful what you say 
Hey, there are ladies present

253
00:26:40,484 --> 00:26:42,315
Never hit a deposit  
before

254
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:45,714
Sorry, laughed Banducci  
our art so I fell

255
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:50,023
Since when are you like? the artists  
should handle criticism 
you are right

256
00:26:50,561 --> 00:26:52,085
He was already in a bad place

257
00:26:52,596 --> 00:26:56,157
He had taken a couple of drinks and  
someone thought I painted your big eyes

258
00:26:56,901 --> 00:27:00,466
What? 
#I do not understand because  would you do that?

259
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:04,738
It was a misunderstanding 
And then I did not want to compromise  sale

260
00:27:07,611 --> 00:27:08,600
Well do not do it again

261
00:27:18,689 --> 00:27:21,582
Hey  
-- Me you do not have a bad time 
I only came for my stuff

262
00:27:27,197 --> 00:27:30,663
Can you believe it?  
We are exhausted 
I even have a chef

263
00:27:30,868 --> 00:27:31,800
It is a Monday!

264
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:35,495
Walter 
We arrived to home page

265
00:27:36,373 --> 00:27:40,675
People are here because  
want to see the paintings 
Vera adult men fighting

266
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:46,616
I'm sick of you Keane 
I'll see you in court

267
00:27:46,817 --> 00:27:50,618
Son of a bitch! 
#I'm going to sue  -- I'm tired of you

268
00:27:50,854 --> 00:27:51,843
And your paintings

269
00:27:52,523 --> 00:27:56,425
I'm going to sue for insulting  
and offend my great paintings!

270
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,864
Walter Keane was not a  
subtle man

271
00:28:11,976 --> 00:28:13,841
But the subtle does not sell

272
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:20,646
Yes sir 
It was a good circus what they did

273
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:23,577
Dick Nolan, examiner

274
00:28:25,022 --> 00:28:26,887
Hey friend, not you  
remove the dream

275
00:28:27,524 --> 00:28:31,592
I take these things with a spoon  
gives me something to write 
In my column

276
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:33,922
I thought you wrote only  
celebrities

277
00:28:34,832 --> 00:28:38,699
Banducci is famous  
and you hit 
So you're a celebrity  now

278
00:28:40,337 --> 00:28:41,235
Buy me a drink

279
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,168
Hey Gary

280
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:54,315
Then, Walter

281
00:28:55,486 --> 00:28:56,453
Tell me about your work

282
00:28:58,522 --> 00:29:01,346
When I was in paris 
No, that does not

283
00:29:03,694 --> 00:29:04,888
I refer to the homeless kids

284
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:26,347
awake

285
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:29,681
You were a success

286
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:35,053
That night! 
#I sold all your big eyes

287
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:38,919
They love you

288
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:50,829
Need more paintings! 
#Walter!  -- Now!

289
00:29:57,481 --> 00:29:59,210
Quiet, this is an opportunity

290
00:30:00,684 --> 00:30:04,884
We must seize  
as a team 
Go to clubs

291
00:30:05,155 --> 00:30:06,986
You do what you love

292
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:20,331
Get out

293
00:30:28,378 --> 00:30:29,208
I love you

294
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:40,114
They know a poet once said 
The eyes are the windows to the soul

295
00:31:40,951 --> 00:31:43,385
That's why I paint so great,  
I've always done well

296
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:47,317
If you are interested in that style  
I'm working on pieces

297
00:31:48,225 --> 00:31:51,459
I have a blond kid 
In a yellow dress

298
00:31:51,728 --> 00:31:52,695
They break your heart

299
00:31:53,897 --> 00:31:54,829
Walter

300
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:56,958
Honey, why are you here?

301
00:31:59,736 --> 00:32:00,668
why lie

302
00:32:03,073 --> 00:32:03,937
Excuse

303
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:08,144
Wouldst credit for something  
that is not yours

304
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,109
Just trying to close a deal 
These kids are part of my being

305
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:16,710
I am a seller in addition to them  
they could not meet the painter

306
00:32:17,387 --> 00:32:19,514
I can not know because  
You told me to stay at home

307
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:23,250
We're making money, your pocket  
or mine, what is the difference?

308
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,325
You take so lightly 
Not at all

309
00:32:26,597 --> 00:32:30,397
It is no credit, you mean your  
you painted? Well I do not care

310
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:31,964
For me di a monkey painted them

311
00:32:32,803 --> 00:32:36,466
Well I'm glad you can talk  
but without an emotional connection

312
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,866
I just want to share  
with the world

313
00:32:42,312 --> 00:32:46,043
Wish that they are gathering dust  
or hanging in someone's living room?

314
00:32:54,992 --> 00:32:57,583
Who is this man? 
#That's Dino Olivetti

315
00:32:57,794 --> 00:33:01,859
He's a genius with disks  
but not what you think 
He does not speak any English

316
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:02,861
Hey

317
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:06,497
Good to see you

318
00:33:30,327 --> 00:33:35,265
Mr, Olivetti is delighted  
with paint 
Want to know who  is the artist

319
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:54,406
I am what

320
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:29,012
$ 5,000

321
00:34:30,087 --> 00:34:35,052
We won $ 5,000 
And it was not even one  of good

322
00:34:36,293 --> 00:34:39,123
Do you mean one of the YOURS? 
#No, no, no

323
00:34:40,263 --> 00:34:42,026
Well, our, one of our

324
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:46,901
We are now hanging in the collection  
Italian industrialist Dino Olivetti

325
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:50,867
With your support comes credibility 
And with credibility

326
00:34:51,108 --> 00:34:54,037
Comes respect 
What about honesty?

327
00:34:54,845 --> 00:34:58,346
Good painting says "Keane" 
I am Keane

328
00:34:58,882 --> 00:35:01,484
You're Keane 
From now on

329
00:35:01,718 --> 00:35:02,878
We are one and the same

330
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:16,321
My sources say the mayor  
should expect a big surprise today

331
00:35:17,134 --> 00:35:19,159
On behalf of the children of the world

332
00:35:19,903 --> 00:35:23,464
I present this painting  
Mayor of San Francisco

333
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:30,542
My man on the street tells me that  
Soviet ambassadors in the city 
Could Talk

334
00:35:31,748 --> 00:35:33,909
In the interest of peace  
through culture

335
00:35:34,151 --> 00:35:37,348
Dono this painting people  
of the Soviet Union

336
00:35:40,323 --> 00:35:42,421
The Onion 
9:30

337
00:35:42,626 --> 00:35:44,389
Crawford Joan has a  
Dinner reservations

338
00:35:48,532 --> 00:35:51,729
Ms, Crawford in recognition of his  
cinematic genius

339
00:35:52,002 --> 00:35:53,833
We gave this painting!

340
00:35:58,341 --> 00:36:02,801
The cat is out of the bag can reveal  
that our local illuminator, Walter Keane

341
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,603
He has opened his own gallery

342
00:36:11,188 --> 00:36:12,815
Rubén drown when you see this

343
00:36:15,525 --> 00:36:17,322
I remember when my mom  
He painted it

344
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:27,603
Segura? It has had to  
long time ago 
Of course I'm sure

345
00:36:27,804 --> 00:36:30,432
It was in our old apartment  
I was on a kitchen bench

346
00:36:31,007 --> 00:36:34,104
Honey're confused 
I painted it

347
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:37,212
My mother did was using  
my blue dress

348
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:43,241
Many little girls have  
that dress 
Honey, you have a good eye

349
00:36:44,087 --> 00:36:46,647
I painted it but I tried to imitate  
the style of your mother

350
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:49,921
You know how used styles  
to paint?

351
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:53,956
Well you did a good job

352
00:37:13,016 --> 00:37:15,582
hello 
Sorry, there had never  done this before

353
00:37:15,852 --> 00:37:17,410
So I do not know ,,,

354
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:23,417
I was raised a Methodist, if that  
a problem can go 
No, no please

355
00:37:24,261 --> 00:37:26,858
Do we throw people here 
Ok

356
00:37:27,731 --> 00:37:28,755
That worries

357
00:37:30,934 --> 00:37:31,764
Okay ,,,

358
00:37:33,136 --> 00:37:34,228
I lied to my daughter

359
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:37,397
Why would you do that?

360
00:37:39,242 --> 00:37:42,143
My husband pushed me to do

361
00:37:42,345 --> 00:37:44,836
Only he had never lied before  
I'm not that kind of person

362
00:37:45,715 --> 00:37:47,012
Your husband is that kind of person?

363
00:37:51,087 --> 00:37:52,611
I do not think so

364
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:56,488
He likes to tell stories and  
maybe you exaggerate but

365
00:37:58,295 --> 00:38:02,430
He is a good man and 
Just trying to save money  buy a house for the family

366
00:38:02,899 --> 00:38:06,869
And the girl, this lie 
It will cause damage?

367
00:38:07,103 --> 00:38:08,932
Damage? Do Not 
Do Not

368
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:11,429
No I ,,, 
I do not ,,,

369
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,071
Just looking for some answers

370
00:38:17,547 --> 00:38:19,640
Well, the modern world is  
a complicated place

371
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:24,253
occasionally 
The children should be protected from

372
00:38:24,454 --> 00:38:25,512
certain truths

373
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:29,283
Do Not 
Not

374
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:33,928
It seems that her husband tries to do  
best of an imperfect situation

375
00:38:34,798 --> 00:38:37,460
She was raised Christian, you know what I mean

376
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:42,299
The man is the head of the family 
Maybe I should

377
00:38:43,273 --> 00:38:44,399
Trust your judgment

378
00:38:53,617 --> 00:38:55,710
I think it's scary  
ugly and rookie

379
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:59,052
exact 
I love him

380
00:39:04,628 --> 00:39:07,524
We arrived early 
Do not tell me?

381
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:10,994
Thank You

382
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,697
Hey sweetie 
That good party

383
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:22,637
It's happening 
Where is your material?

384
00:39:24,581 --> 00:39:28,213
We decided that this single  
would be the show of Walter 
Oh

385
00:39:28,418 --> 00:39:30,115
You did? 
#Why would you do that?

386
00:39:31,154 --> 00:39:35,813
Oh because Walter is more  
set 
Weird, you know?

387
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:38,959
Walter does not seem the type to paint  
adorable kids and hungry

388
00:39:42,232 --> 00:39:45,599
It's really good to see you 
Thanks future

389
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:53,703
Your husband has enough talent

390
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:56,943
Your pints too?

391
00:40:02,185 --> 00:40:03,618
I do not know ,,,

392
00:40:12,529 --> 00:40:15,855
Curiosity causes me your ethnic 
How long will I take  paint that piece?

393
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:19,729
That? 
#Probably months ,,,

394
00:40:20,203 --> 00:40:24,839
First I thought, sketch 
Then find the time  alone with the oils

395
00:40:25,742 --> 00:40:28,077
Oils? 
#Is not acrylic?

396
00:40:28,778 --> 00:40:29,767
Ah that, if

397
00:40:31,448 --> 00:40:34,949
Yes, it's like 
A mixture of ideas

398
00:40:35,985 --> 00:40:37,384
Spinning in my head

399
00:40:39,889 --> 00:40:40,913
So where  
you get your ideas?

400
00:40:44,461 --> 00:40:45,393
A do you mean?

401
00:40:46,863 --> 00:40:50,599
I mean 
Because they are all images  of children?

402
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:25,661
Our art critic John Canaday 
With a perspective on the  Walter Keane work

403
00:41:26,636 --> 00:41:29,104
Keane's work is  
completely without distinction

404
00:41:30,373 --> 00:41:34,567
Not a member of society  
Artists West 
There is someone important

405
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:39,412
It is only known for his appearances in  
gossip columns

406
00:41:40,784 --> 00:41:43,344
Mr, Keane is why  
society needs critical

407
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:46,620
To protect against such atrocities

408
00:41:48,224 --> 00:41:49,191
Mom?

409
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,560
Mom! 
#I can go ?,

410
00:41:54,864 --> 00:41:57,424
You can not 
Mom is busy right now

411
00:42:00,503 --> 00:42:01,367
What are you doing?

412
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,974
Hey sweetie, come

413
00:42:13,016 --> 00:42:14,779
You need to respect  
privacy of your mother

414
00:42:16,419 --> 00:42:18,148
Sometimes adults need  
time alone

415
00:42:20,056 --> 00:42:20,784
Come

416
00:42:28,765 --> 00:42:30,357
That's the ice cream truck?

417
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:37,706
Go for a good ice cream!

418
00:42:48,017 --> 00:42:49,712
Out of this world!

419
00:42:53,056 --> 00:42:56,617
I do not feel comfortable with this  
I used to do it differently and now ,,,

420
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,693
Jane is fine, went to where the ice cream ,,,

421
00:43:00,396 --> 00:43:02,626
It has new shoes even  
a fund for college

422
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,967
maybe

423
00:43:05,635 --> 00:43:09,093
Only this dizzy all  
madness of the last days

424
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,743
I need your help 
I want to go on television to  defend our art

425
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:20,011
Wait, come out on TV? 
#Yes but, you say?

426
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:24,315
I mean, that forces me to paint

427
00:43:25,221 --> 00:43:26,085
This?

428
00:43:27,824 --> 00:43:29,917
Maybe you have an obsession  
with little girls

429
00:43:31,027 --> 00:43:31,755
adorable

430
00:43:32,862 --> 00:43:36,292
Sorry 
Imagine painting them  in the corner

431
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:40,564
Yes 
Perhaps the winter warmth  help me

432
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:42,896
Walter, art is personal

433
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:50,440
Which requires a grown man  
to paint something?

434
00:43:51,648 --> 00:43:56,076
Because I ,,, 
I lived surrounded by six sisters

435
00:43:56,486 --> 00:44:00,154
I grew up in an orphanage 
I ,,,

436
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:05,151
I lived in a world 
Where adults were gone  and the kids and kittens

437
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:08,922
They ran wild for  
desolate landscape

438
00:44:10,934 --> 00:44:12,868
What about your streets  
why you painted?

439
00:44:13,369 --> 00:44:16,805
Well, I lived, I experienced

440
00:44:17,373 --> 00:44:21,474
Not only were streets and flowers? 
#Of course not

441
00:44:21,911 --> 00:44:23,310
It was after the war

442
00:44:29,218 --> 00:44:31,618
Destruction everywhere

443
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:37,081
Travel by continent

444
00:44:38,061 --> 00:44:40,256
The slaughter was horrible

445
00:44:40,997 --> 00:44:44,125
My mind was marked  
and my art too

446
00:44:44,968 --> 00:44:48,466
Nothing in my life 
He has had much impact

447
00:44:48,738 --> 00:44:50,296
As the sight of the children

448
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:54,268
The war destroyed 
innocence

449
00:44:54,544 --> 00:44:56,810
without parents 
homeless

450
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,547
Fighting for trash

451
00:45:00,383 --> 00:45:03,682
This is how my life as a painter

452
00:45:03,886 --> 00:45:05,444
It started suddenly

453
00:45:09,058 --> 00:45:11,193
Thenceforth 
I painted

454
00:45:11,394 --> 00:45:14,389
The lost kids 
With big eyes

455
00:45:16,366 --> 00:45:20,096
those eyes 
That always have their  tantalizing quality

456
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:02,635
How many sales today? 
#Sales?

457
00:46:02,912 --> 00:46:07,277
None with this public 
These people just look,  They can not afford these paintings

458
00:46:07,984 --> 00:46:10,282
But we have given many  
posters

459
00:46:22,732 --> 00:46:26,963
I started charging for posters 
First five cents, then 10

460
00:46:28,137 --> 00:46:30,401
If people are crazy

461
00:46:32,341 --> 00:46:36,337
But then I started thinking 
You would rather sell a painting  $ 500

462
00:46:36,546 --> 00:46:41,476
Or a million posters reproduced  
cheaply? 
#People really do not care  if a copy

463
00:46:41,717 --> 00:46:43,480
They just want art that touches

464
00:46:44,654 --> 00:46:46,383
And we could sell anywhere

465
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,320
Where!

466
00:48:33,729 --> 00:48:37,095
It stinks here, should open  
window 
What time is it?

467
00:48:38,334 --> 00:48:41,192
6:30 
You have there? let me see

468
00:48:41,404 --> 00:48:45,033
Walter No, it's personal 
Personal? We are married

469
00:48:45,308 --> 00:48:47,139
We should not hide  
each other secrets

470
00:48:48,244 --> 00:48:49,404
Put it up there,  
put it up there

471
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:01,320
It is a style completely  
different

472
00:49:03,092 --> 00:49:03,990
Yes, it is

473
00:49:05,061 --> 00:49:06,221
It looks like you

474
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:09,562
Well, it's ,,, 
a self--portrait

475
00:49:14,604 --> 00:49:17,504
I would not know how to explain it 
I was thinking that

476
00:49:20,643 --> 00:49:22,809
Maybe I could 
Signing myself

477
00:49:23,112 --> 00:49:25,012
That sounds a little confusing,  
do not you think?

478
00:49:26,415 --> 00:49:29,113
I mean Keane 
I know

479
00:49:29,418 --> 00:49:30,908
But when people ask me  
if pinto

480
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,386
I do not know how to respond and be nice  
to say, this is mine

481
00:49:36,158 --> 00:49:38,854
Who told him big eyes?  
-- Nobody

482
00:49:39,061 --> 00:49:41,586
If you tell someone this  
empire collapses

483
00:49:42,965 --> 00:49:44,159
You want to return the money

484
00:49:45,268 --> 00:49:47,731
We have committed fraud 
I know

485
00:49:49,272 --> 00:49:51,998
My God, I know 
I think about it every minute  of my life

486
00:49:54,043 --> 00:49:55,840
I kept half of the deal

487
00:49:57,113 --> 00:49:59,308
I have not told anyone

488
00:50:01,517 --> 00:50:04,345
Please 
Just let me have this

489
00:50:06,522 --> 00:50:09,788
I did not know you painted, Margaret 
Yes, do not talk about it

490
00:50:11,193 --> 00:50:15,325
Unfortunately people do not  
buy female art 
What about Georgia O'Keeffe?

491
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:20,591
Then Margaret, where  
you get your ideas?

492
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:27,938
Well, the world around me 
And I just ,,,

493
00:50:28,411 --> 00:50:30,003
I love Modigliani ,,,  
-- Modi what?

494
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:35,775
Modigliani 
Please, it's gossip column,  cling to familiar Angulo

495
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:38,314
Check out the  
little Jane here

496
00:50:39,422 --> 00:50:40,616
That talent!

497
00:50:41,691 --> 00:50:45,659
Look at us to Keane 
When you open our veins  bleed oil

498
00:50:53,536 --> 00:50:55,367
Ah a little taste

499
00:50:56,405 --> 00:51:00,273
The fourth member of the  
painters Keane

500
00:51:01,043 --> 00:51:04,077
Lily honey, how are you? 
#I'm fine, Dad

501
00:51:05,314 --> 00:51:07,443
I lost a tooth 
Really?

502
00:51:08,851 --> 00:51:09,715
You got into a fight?

503
00:51:10,886 --> 00:51:13,847
No, I fell 
Okay!

504
00:51:14,123 --> 00:51:17,923
The tooth fairy is something  
I'll deal or your mom and handled it?

505
00:51:18,394 --> 00:51:19,292
She handled it

506
00:51:21,297 --> 00:51:23,397
Well, well 
Well, Jane

507
00:51:23,866 --> 00:51:27,262
Come 
Come show him the room  of the children

508
00:51:27,536 --> 00:51:31,538
and then 
You girls can  have a good time

509
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:40,146
Walter 
You never told me that  had another daughter

510
00:51:42,284 --> 00:51:45,345
I did not? clear 
Lily is my first marriage

511
00:51:49,992 --> 00:51:52,626
apology 
Sorry, sorry

512
00:51:55,498 --> 00:51:57,759
Walter 
I can talk to you?

513
00:52:03,005 --> 00:52:05,295
What's happening there? 
#That's Lily

514
00:52:05,508 --> 00:52:08,543
Sure that I mentioned 
No, you did not

515
00:52:10,379 --> 00:52:12,512
It will move here? 
#Do Not

516
00:52:13,048 --> 00:52:16,513
His mother go to Vegas  
the weekend 
I should have it opposes  once a month but

517
00:52:16,752 --> 00:52:19,950
I do not set according to his mom 
How could you lie with  something so big?

518
00:52:20,156 --> 00:52:22,420
As it is a very sweet little girl  
-- I bet it is

519
00:52:22,925 --> 00:52:25,416
Well I held your daughter  
and never said anything

520
00:52:27,129 --> 00:52:29,527
I'll pretend you did not say that 
Ok?

521
00:52:29,799 --> 00:52:33,801
Sorry 
Please only finish  with this

522
00:52:52,455 --> 00:52:54,252
I have met many  
celebrities

523
00:52:54,523 --> 00:52:57,856
And only a certain type of creature  
You can live in that light

524
00:52:58,127 --> 00:53:02,188
Walter had that ability,  
Margaret? not much

525
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,664
I painted this 
Really?

526
00:53:09,104 --> 00:53:11,706
It is very 
evocative

527
00:53:13,576 --> 00:53:14,440
sensual

528
00:53:20,883 --> 00:53:22,077
MDH

529
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,781
You are very 
mysterious

530
00:53:29,024 --> 00:53:29,752
Yes

531
00:53:30,025 --> 00:53:34,894
Do not use my name because people do not  
serious female art

532
00:53:35,097 --> 00:53:36,621
MDH are my initials

533
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,427
And 
I'm interested in numerology

534
00:53:40,636 --> 00:53:42,331
As you know, the 7 is a good number

535
00:53:43,739 --> 00:53:46,706
Seven? 
#Luckily my  maiden name is

536
00:53:46,909 --> 00:53:49,939
Doris Margaret Hawkins 
Letter M is number 13  alphabet

537
00:53:50,513 --> 00:53:54,372
D is the number four  
H is the number eight 
And if one has a  and three from 13

538
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:57,908
An orgy color 
And some ,,,

539
00:53:58,821 --> 00:54:02,686
Sunbeam, sorry 
Which makes 4 + 4 + 8

540
00:54:03,092 --> 00:54:06,125
Da 16 and then 1 + 6 
da 7

541
00:54:06,328 --> 00:54:06,919
Margaret?

542
00:54:08,364 --> 00:54:09,092
just a moment

543
00:54:12,067 --> 00:54:15,033
Wow, that these babbling? 
#Divisions?

544
00:54:15,538 --> 00:54:17,472
Could you please help  
the world and close your mouth?

545
00:54:18,374 --> 00:54:21,207
They are only interested  
in big eyes

546
00:54:21,744 --> 00:54:24,577
Two nuts that fell from the same  
tree is insufferable

547
00:54:25,281 --> 00:54:28,411
Why go hungry while  
they print money? 
#Because the nut is a genius

548
00:54:28,884 --> 00:54:29,646
Sell paintings

549
00:54:30,152 --> 00:54:33,986
And sells paintings and images  
sells postcards of the images of paintings

550
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:38,423
I bet you could make a  
10 minutes 
Would question your sincerity

551
00:54:38,694 --> 00:54:40,252
Ah, customers do not  
will realize

552
00:54:47,202 --> 00:54:48,430
Christ is a movement

553
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:22,495
Hello, DeeAnn 
My God, I thought it was  the wrong direction

554
00:55:23,472 --> 00:55:26,032
I know, is a very large entry

555
00:55:26,942 --> 00:55:29,308
I can honestly nor  
believe I moved here

556
00:55:30,779 --> 00:55:33,441
I know 
We have two acres

557
00:55:33,983 --> 00:55:36,077
a pool 
five rooms

558
00:55:36,752 --> 00:55:40,683
I found excessive 
Since only ,,,

559
00:55:40,923 --> 00:55:41,855
There are three of us here

560
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:44,949
Been so long  
since I've seen

561
00:55:45,995 --> 00:55:49,860
I know 
North Beach is 30 miles  The same would be 300

562
00:55:50,332 --> 00:55:53,733
Well, probably're busy out  
with all your rich friends

563
00:55:54,436 --> 00:55:57,629
Please, these are friends  
Walter 
He brings people here

564
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,300
The Beach Boys came

565
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:04,873
Are you hungry?

566
00:56:06,448 --> 00:56:07,210
I am thirsty

567
00:56:08,951 --> 00:56:12,415
When we moved I thought  
a bar was something extravagant 
but

568
00:56:12,621 --> 00:56:16,986
You'd be surprised that both  
you can use 
So Walter is?

569
00:56:19,328 --> 00:56:22,695
I could not be happier 
It has everything you ever dreamed

570
00:56:23,232 --> 00:56:24,062
And you too

571
00:56:25,501 --> 00:56:26,399
fabulous

572
00:56:30,506 --> 00:56:31,530
That is your art studio?

573
00:56:33,609 --> 00:56:36,240
Do you want to go there 
I want to look

574
00:56:36,912 --> 00:56:41,810
I want to see what it looks workplace  
a successful artist 
Oh no, no

575
00:56:42,651 --> 00:56:45,647
DeeAnn? Please do not go there 
sight

576
00:56:46,622 --> 00:56:48,055
You can not go in there

577
00:56:53,595 --> 00:56:54,857
Walter pint here too

578
00:56:56,732 --> 00:56:58,461
Walter is at home now?

579
00:57:00,302 --> 00:57:01,462
What the hell happened?

580
00:57:03,505 --> 00:57:06,538
Nothing, I ,,, 
I just ,,,

581
00:57:07,242 --> 00:57:09,176
I invited DeeAnn by ,,,

582
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:13,341
You know I do not like anyone  
see my work before finishing

583
00:57:34,369 --> 00:57:37,805
How dare you call  
fraud

584
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:42,536
Shut up, you're a liar, Walter 
Get out of my house, my big house

585
00:57:42,811 --> 00:57:47,373
Go to continue looking briefs  
fisherman

586
00:57:47,583 --> 00:57:48,345
Fuck

587
00:57:54,623 --> 00:57:56,420
I do not want back  
never invite

588
00:57:58,127 --> 00:57:59,025
I will not do

589
00:58:09,772 --> 00:58:12,038
Well, Jane I go to work 
I can go?

590
00:58:12,508 --> 00:58:15,507
No, I never can go 
I should not even ask

591
00:58:33,495 --> 00:58:34,519
And as you came you here?

592
00:58:35,764 --> 00:58:37,356
Do not you hear  
allowed visits?

593
00:58:41,403 --> 00:58:42,597
This has come not?

594
00:58:43,639 --> 00:58:45,937
You're the only living soul  
I can tell you my secret

595
00:58:47,476 --> 00:58:48,340
Okay

596
00:58:50,179 --> 00:58:51,271
I painted I

597
00:58:52,381 --> 00:58:54,980
I did it 
All and each

598
00:58:55,217 --> 00:58:58,051
All big eyes 
I

599
00:58:58,754 --> 00:59:00,381
And no one but you will know

600
00:59:03,392 --> 00:59:04,791
And I will paint another one now

601
00:59:05,894 --> 00:59:09,830
Look what I've come a girl  
crazy talking to a dog

602
01:00:24,907 --> 01:00:26,534
A productive day  
today

603
01:00:29,111 --> 01:00:31,238
I ran into a hot gossip

604
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:35,976
The Madame Chiang Kai--Shek  
come to town opposite Taipei

605
01:00:37,819 --> 01:00:41,050
I think we should introduce  
a painting

606
01:00:41,723 --> 01:00:43,156
Dick's interview

607
01:00:44,693 --> 01:00:47,922
To hell with Dick 
I met a new type  UPI

608
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:51,597
maybe 
She would like one of your  street scenes

609
01:00:52,868 --> 01:00:56,727
I know why I did not think you could make a 
Trash Chinatown

610
01:00:56,939 --> 01:01:00,739
With adorable and little girls 
Something like a mixture of eyes  large and Chinese

611
01:01:02,911 --> 01:01:06,909
Do Not 
No, she is a dignitary  and she deserves

612
01:01:07,516 --> 01:01:09,347
A piece that comes directly from you

613
01:01:12,087 --> 01:01:14,947
You think so? 
#Well, maybe you're right

614
01:01:16,091 --> 01:01:19,527
Probably not have a scene of paris  
hung in his palace

615
01:01:19,728 --> 01:01:23,129
Unless the madame and  
have a S, Cenic

616
01:01:26,134 --> 01:01:27,260
What did you say?  
-- A S, Cenic

617
01:01:28,303 --> 01:01:31,033
Is the painter who did all  
your previous work

618
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:46,385
It was my nickname in Paris 
To all my friends paint him  liked both my scenic view

619
01:01:46,655 --> 01:01:50,590
They called me, well they could not  
pronounce it properly 
I called S, Cenic

620
01:01:52,828 --> 01:01:54,989
The more you lie more  
little you look

621
01:01:56,131 --> 01:02:00,128
How dare you accuse me  
lying 
I am proud of my  previous work

622
01:02:00,402 --> 01:02:04,901
So why paintedst  
about the name? 
#A council never use basis  of water on a oleo

623
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,600
It goes fast

624
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:11,810
You sound a crazy love  
God 
You've seen me painting

625
01:02:14,282 --> 01:02:15,340
I have not done

626
01:02:18,153 --> 01:02:21,786
I always thought 
He had done it but it's like  a mirage

627
01:02:23,091 --> 01:02:25,059
From a distance you look like a painter

628
01:02:26,061 --> 01:02:27,756
But up close there is not much there

629
01:02:30,966 --> 01:02:34,492
I went to Paris 
I studied there

630
01:02:36,905 --> 01:02:40,100
I spent hours and hours 
In the Louvre

631
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:43,173
Looking at the grandeur of the masses  
-- Walter

632
01:02:46,181 --> 01:02:47,443
Have you ever been to Paris?

633
01:03:00,328 --> 01:03:04,196
I just wanted to ,,, become  
an artist

634
01:03:04,499 --> 01:03:06,194
Just never turned out well

635
01:03:19,247 --> 01:03:20,646
I do not want to sleep here

636
01:03:21,817 --> 01:03:25,175
There are three additional bedrooms  
in this house 
Go to choose one

637
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:51,501
The more of these there behind? 
#I do not know, maybe three thousand or so?

638
01:03:51,546 --> 01:03:54,139
You can print more?  
-- Excuse me Miss 
How much is this painting

639
01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:57,415
Go, for I pay? 
#If Mr, Keane

640
01:04:03,692 --> 01:04:05,387
Not even one of mine,  
one of hers

641
01:04:16,304 --> 01:04:17,532
This does not change anything

642
01:04:19,975 --> 01:04:22,608
another truth 
Who cares?

643
01:04:23,545 --> 01:04:24,910
Maybe it's time to shake  
things

644
01:04:26,047 --> 01:04:29,178
And start putting my name  
MDH below 
Do Not

645
01:04:29,918 --> 01:04:34,245
Absolutely not, and hate me  
by letting the first 
Shut Up

646
01:04:35,824 --> 01:04:38,756
Do not raise your voice 
Oh, I will speak

647
01:04:39,227 --> 01:04:41,058
As strong as you like

648
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:44,931
Do not do it or I'll kill you

649
01:04:47,102 --> 01:04:49,570
What? 
#If you tell someone

650
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:52,306
I watch, I meet people

651
01:04:52,974 --> 01:04:55,169
Remember cousin Banducci,  
the seller of liquor wholesale

652
01:04:57,078 --> 01:04:57,976
Are you threatening me?

653
01:05:00,081 --> 01:05:02,013
All Right 
Kill Me

654
01:05:02,584 --> 01:05:06,553
My God, I have kept your  
secret for years 
And not once have I ,,,

655
01:05:09,057 --> 01:05:10,251
You know how hard this  
It has been for me?

656
01:05:12,761 --> 01:05:13,750
I have no friends

657
01:05:14,796 --> 01:05:17,021
I lied 
My own daughter

658
01:05:21,703 --> 01:05:25,100
Life imitates art 
A king crying

659
01:05:27,142 --> 01:05:28,109
Walter, do you want?

660
01:05:31,279 --> 01:05:32,507
Everything with you is calculated

661
01:05:33,848 --> 01:05:35,645
We are back where we had  
first date

662
01:05:41,656 --> 01:05:45,023
Look, do not deny it, I need you  
you're the one who has the gift

663
01:05:47,262 --> 01:05:51,826
Now, there is an opportunity to ,,,  
Oh my God 
I am excited

664
01:05:52,901 --> 01:05:54,459
The New York World's Fair

665
01:05:55,537 --> 01:06:00,139
70 million visitors 
The opening day, I will show  my masterpiece

666
01:06:00,809 --> 01:06:03,040
That masterpiece? 
#exact

667
01:06:04,279 --> 01:06:07,672
Where he has been all  
this time? 
#Da Vinci Mona Lisa has its

668
01:06:08,016 --> 01:06:11,742
Renoir has his lunch Fishermen 
Where is my final statement?

669
01:06:12,454 --> 01:06:13,512
You sound like crazy

670
01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:19,257
An artist not only announced  
his masterpiece 
Why not?

671
01:06:19,494 --> 01:06:23,726
Miguel Angelo did not know that to something great  
to paint the Sistine Chapel?

672
01:06:24,232 --> 01:06:25,631
It took four years

673
01:06:27,235 --> 01:06:31,035
But this is the best part 
It is for UNICEF

674
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:33,799
UNICEF sponsored the entire education

675
01:06:34,943 --> 01:06:37,707
Finally we will reward the  
kids of the world

676
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:12,903
When people ask me, 'why  
It was stood ?, fear, lack of trust? ''

677
01:07:13,782 --> 01:07:16,580
Margaret was trapped in a  
lie had helped create

678
01:07:16,851 --> 01:07:18,978
And other coverage was worse  
that crime

679
01:07:21,523 --> 01:07:24,788
Why were promised a canvas  
this size?

680
01:07:25,493 --> 01:07:28,291
Because it must meet all  
kids, all races

681
01:07:28,797 --> 01:07:32,631
Hundreds of faces 
Marching to infinity

682
01:07:33,668 --> 01:07:34,794
Latest from Walter Keane

683
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:39,333
The publisher says it is good for  
out a coffee table book

684
01:07:40,008 --> 01:07:41,032
You know, something elegant

685
01:07:41,543 --> 01:07:45,877
The teachers of tomorrow need  
my portfolio early

686
01:07:46,715 --> 01:07:50,308
My artistic evolution  
-- Yes 
Where are all your  preliminary sketches?

687
01:07:51,853 --> 01:07:54,344
All that time you spent in  
art school which seem to have

688
01:07:54,589 --> 01:07:57,649
Made all these young experiments  
these portraits coal unfinished

689
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,720
They should be here  
somewhere

690
01:08:04,232 --> 01:08:05,460
I know you're being  
sarcastic

691
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:10,730
Just some ideas ,,, orphans paints,  
early self portraits

692
01:08:11,473 --> 01:08:12,906
Get out of here try to work

693
01:08:17,645 --> 01:08:20,341
Mom? 
#What about dinner?

694
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:23,844
Mom're home?

695
01:08:29,557 --> 01:08:30,455
Mom?

696
01:09:19,908 --> 01:09:22,672
Jane 
What are you doing in the study of Walter?

697
01:09:26,648 --> 01:09:27,512
I know

698
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:32,278
You know nothing 
I'm not a girl

699
01:09:38,426 --> 01:09:39,120
Jane

700
01:09:55,944 --> 01:09:59,606
Five, six pages 
There is something here that I see?

701
01:10:00,281 --> 01:10:03,409
It's like the hula hula 
no disappears

702
01:10:05,453 --> 01:10:08,251
It will be unveiled at the large pavilion  
Hall of education

703
01:10:09,824 --> 01:10:12,725
International artist and celebrated  
has been selected

704
01:10:14,095 --> 01:10:16,495
To represent aspirations  
of the children worldwide?

705
01:10:17,699 --> 01:10:18,461
This is absurd

706
01:10:28,543 --> 01:10:30,534
And who was on the committee  
selection?

707
01:10:31,913 --> 01:10:34,245
Well, there was a committee  
so to speak

708
01:10:35,617 --> 01:10:39,885
Just went to lunch with him,  
Jerome and I 
And the wife of Jerome

709
01:10:40,588 --> 01:10:42,681
Technically not invite  
presentations

710
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:45,653
Mr, Keane just us  
contacted directly

711
01:10:52,634 --> 01:10:53,566
Let

712
01:10:55,003 --> 01:10:58,700
The World's Fair opens Thursday,  
paintings for sale

713
01:10:59,574 --> 01:11:00,836
On Friday divorce request

714
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:04,109
Why are you always so  
miserable?

715
01:11:07,382 --> 01:11:11,352
Okay 
I will enjoy my afternoon

716
01:11:14,489 --> 01:11:17,513
Ms, Tisdale 
Walter Keane

717
01:11:18,059 --> 01:11:22,792
I just wanted to thank you for hosting  
This lovely evening

718
01:11:22,997 --> 01:11:24,862
Well, you are welcome

719
01:11:27,869 --> 01:11:30,471
Hey Keane 
You've seen the New York Times?

720
01:11:31,172 --> 01:11:35,233
Honestly I've been so busy all  
day preparing for this occasion

721
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:37,102
I think you should read

722
01:12:01,936 --> 01:12:03,862
"Terrible" 
'' Grotesque "

723
01:12:04,072 --> 01:12:07,135
"Disgusting" 
As someone could say something  so cruel?

724
01:12:07,675 --> 01:12:10,974
That you care? 
#My name is trailing  by Iodo

725
01:12:12,814 --> 01:12:13,803
It is he here?

726
01:12:14,816 --> 01:12:18,377
If, which is probably  
that all ,,,

727
01:12:23,691 --> 01:12:24,658
Who wrote this shit?

728
01:12:28,096 --> 01:12:31,126
Mr, Keane 
This is not the way

729
01:12:31,966 --> 01:12:35,868
You may want to write  
a letter to the editor? 
#What are you afraid of?

730
01:12:36,971 --> 01:12:40,899
Just because people do  
like my work 
That means it's bad?  -- Do Not

731
01:12:41,209 --> 01:12:46,109
But neither becomes art 
Art should raise not please

732
01:12:46,347 --> 01:12:49,915
Particularly if you are in  
classroom education 
You have no idea

733
01:12:50,218 --> 01:12:53,485
Why someone becomes critical? 
#Because you can not create

734
01:12:53,988 --> 01:12:57,387
Oh go 
That tone is not ,,,  -- Do not give me that

735
01:12:57,825 --> 01:13:00,760
Do not know what to put your  
emotions out there

736
01:13:01,029 --> 01:13:04,756
Naked for all  
the world to see 
That emotions?

737
01:13:04,966 --> 01:13:09,726
It is synthetic work 
Your masterpiece is an infinity  Keane

738
01:13:10,171 --> 01:13:12,469
What makes it an infinity  
garbage

739
01:13:59,253 --> 01:14:02,245
What's wrong with the child  
denominator?

740
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,121
That this country was built!

741
01:14:13,334 --> 01:14:18,294
I have to sue them all

742
01:14:19,207 --> 01:14:20,105
all

743
01:14:25,079 --> 01:14:27,809
I'll sue this fag critical

744
01:14:40,595 --> 01:14:42,460
Take that UNICEF

745
01:14:43,331 --> 01:14:46,767
With your small boxes  
nice money

746
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:00,344
But you'll be happy, right?

747
01:15:03,184 --> 01:15:05,618
You made me the ultimate betrayal

748
01:15:06,921 --> 01:15:09,719
Me down with that picture

749
01:15:17,965 --> 01:15:19,557
crossed from

750
01:15:20,001 --> 01:15:23,027
Sentimentality garbage

751
01:15:25,006 --> 01:15:25,870
Walter for

752
01:15:38,686 --> 01:15:43,317
You made me look bad 
You made people laugh my

753
01:15:44,859 --> 01:15:46,292
Open up, open up!

754
01:15:48,629 --> 01:15:49,653
Let me in!

755
01:16:06,914 --> 01:16:08,848
I can see you

756
01:16:22,263 --> 01:16:24,254
I'll take them with smoke

757
01:16:28,703 --> 01:16:29,727
They will fly as a  
atomic bomb

758
01:16:45,386 --> 01:16:46,580
Where are they?

759
01:16:59,166 --> 01:17:02,259
I'm so sorry 
Not be the mother I could be

760
01:17:04,739 --> 01:17:05,933
I should have done this years ago

761
01:17:07,675 --> 01:17:09,836
Where are we going? Is very cold

762
01:17:12,513 --> 01:17:13,912
Where we're going we do not need much?

763
01:17:16,484 --> 01:17:17,314
Hawaii

764
01:17:19,587 --> 01:17:21,113
Really? 
#Yes

765
01:17:21,589 --> 01:17:23,489
If it is a paradise because there

766
01:17:24,625 --> 01:17:28,393
There are many birds and flowers 
And beautiful colors

767
01:17:30,197 --> 01:17:31,994
We will make a new life  
for us

768
01:17:34,135 --> 01:17:36,365
Ok? 
#That's my girl

769
01:18:29,957 --> 01:18:32,916
Hello? 
#You were hard to track

770
01:18:33,227 --> 01:18:34,489
I thought I'd never find you

771
01:18:36,697 --> 01:18:37,527
Walter

772
01:18:38,799 --> 01:18:44,135
I'm a little hectic, I received a  
strangers papers in the mail today

773
01:18:45,606 --> 01:18:48,632
It is a form of legal separation  
and appreciate that it will sign

774
01:18:49,643 --> 01:18:52,373
Yes 
Do not you being a bit  impulsive?

775
01:18:53,881 --> 01:18:55,007
Walter want a divorce

776
01:18:56,684 --> 01:19:00,482
It hurts to hear you say these words 
Sorry it come  this

777
01:19:01,355 --> 01:19:03,722
Okay 
I guess

778
01:19:04,025 --> 01:19:06,960
I could accept separate  
if you

779
01:19:07,628 --> 01:19:10,893
You agree to spend the rights of all  
painting produced

780
01:19:15,369 --> 01:19:17,662
If that's the price 
Really?

781
01:19:20,674 --> 01:19:25,172
Ok 
Well then we have to consider  future earnings

782
01:19:25,479 --> 01:19:29,815
God, Walter, the more  
need money? 
#If you want me out of your life  listen to me

783
01:19:31,652 --> 01:19:35,213
You'll have to paint 100 paintings more  
with the name of Walter Keane

784
01:19:41,128 --> 01:19:41,958
Jane

785
01:19:43,731 --> 01:19:46,998
I'll go to the post office,  
You want something? 
#There I go surfing with the gang

786
01:19:48,469 --> 01:19:51,764
I think Jane friends  
They are a bit wild 
Calm down mom

787
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:55,439
You're impossible 
Bring me all the way  to Hawaii

788
01:19:55,643 --> 01:19:58,510
I make some friends and all  
what you do is complain about them

789
01:19:59,547 --> 01:20:00,912
Maybe you need to make some

790
01:20:02,216 --> 01:20:04,446
Know that he could not have  
friends at home

791
01:20:05,753 --> 01:20:08,483
That was why hide  
pleasant pictures

792
01:20:49,663 --> 01:20:52,923
Hello, we are visiting all  
in the neighborhood 
We have an important message

793
01:20:53,934 --> 01:20:55,401
We have something to share with you

794
01:20:55,669 --> 01:20:59,161
About the wonderful things the  
kingdom of God will do for mankind

795
01:21:00,207 --> 01:21:04,405
Well from my point of view I do not see  
much good, just pride, theft

796
01:21:04,612 --> 01:21:08,807
And be bad to each other 
You know what it says on Timothy  1 to 5?

797
01:21:09,583 --> 01:21:13,377
In recent days 
Critics times that are  difficult deal

798
01:21:13,621 --> 01:21:17,180
They'll be here 
Because men  worship themselves

799
01:21:17,892 --> 01:21:19,018
Sounds like my ex husband

800
01:21:30,137 --> 01:21:30,933
We like to get ?,

801
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:41,774
It says right here 
A worshiper of Muhammad should be  honest at all

802
01:21:43,984 --> 01:21:45,781
I can not believe you left  
People go home

803
01:21:47,454 --> 01:21:48,216
It also says

804
01:21:49,523 --> 01:21:54,224
No lies, tell the truth 
If you were a thief, do not ever steal

805
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:02,991
Shit, this is crazy 
All these copies

806
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:05,863
You're like Warhol 
Do Not

807
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:07,398
Warhol's how I

808
01:22:08,509 --> 01:22:10,272
That fool stole my act

809
01:22:11,979 --> 01:22:13,173
my art

810
01:22:14,281 --> 01:22:18,244
The manufactures 
Had a factory before knowing  it was a soup

811
01:22:34,902 --> 01:22:38,167
Oh if we have a special guest  
Today, a worldwide celebrity

812
01:22:38,539 --> 01:22:41,266
Let's give a big welcome 
Margaret Keane

813
01:22:43,477 --> 01:22:47,538
So it's true that your husband Walter  
It is a big seller of paintings in the world?

814
01:22:52,119 --> 01:22:54,380
Do Not 
Big Lolo

815
01:22:54,588 --> 01:22:56,719
Everything you just said 
It is false

816
01:22:58,292 --> 01:23:01,927
one 
Walter and I are no longer married

817
01:23:02,997 --> 01:23:07,295
And two 
He is not a painter

818
01:23:11,438 --> 01:23:15,340
But is not the one who makes the  
crazy eyes?

819
01:23:17,478 --> 01:23:21,846
Do Not 
But if he has taken credit  that for 10 years

820
01:23:24,285 --> 01:23:28,281
I am 
The only painter in the family

821
01:24:07,995 --> 01:24:09,223
You must be kidding

822
01:24:09,963 --> 01:24:14,696
They know that bother me? Margaret le  
broke the news to a big press buttons

823
01:24:15,602 --> 01:24:18,127
And there is an excellent reporter  
Celebrities like me

824
01:24:20,274 --> 01:24:21,104
I knew it

825
01:24:27,448 --> 01:24:28,881
Expected

826
01:24:38,592 --> 01:24:40,794
Margaret has gone mad 
You have to help

827
01:24:41,295 --> 01:24:45,629
I need a story 
A national story to calm things

828
01:24:45,899 --> 01:24:49,866
I do not know Walter 
What he said was quite explosive

829
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:52,837
It is crazy! 
#Not even make sense

830
01:24:53,107 --> 01:24:58,040
While I was studying art in Paris 
She was a girl in Tennessee

831
01:24:58,946 --> 01:24:59,674
sight

832
01:25:02,549 --> 01:25:03,573
My early drafts

833
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:09,382
Orphans Berlin 1949

834
01:25:11,058 --> 01:25:12,423
Margaret Why would he do that?

835
01:25:13,494 --> 01:25:17,224
You are sick in the head 
He left me to go to the jungle

836
01:25:17,831 --> 01:25:19,389
He went with religious fanatics

837
01:25:22,636 --> 01:25:27,140
Witnesses Muhammad 
Really do not know much about them

838
01:25:27,975 --> 01:25:29,135
No celebrate Christmas

839
01:25:29,376 --> 01:25:32,607
They can not salute the flag  
do not let Jane go to the prom

840
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:41,553
It makes me look crazy 
He says I copy it,  he taught me how to paint

841
01:25:41,822 --> 01:25:45,383
Using a projector to trace my  
work and fill colors

842
01:25:46,794 --> 01:25:49,392
And how much of that is not true? 
#all

843
01:25:50,097 --> 01:25:51,223
I feel good about myself

844
01:25:51,432 --> 01:25:55,163
For the first time in years and I can not  
Walter let me remove it

845
01:25:56,904 --> 01:25:59,031
And what if it demands?

846
01:26:03,811 --> 01:26:07,475
$ 17 million 
The art world is altered

847
01:26:07,748 --> 01:26:10,342
Today the lawyers present their  
opening arguments

848
01:26:10,584 --> 01:26:14,248
For Margaret Keane  
against Walter Keane 
And what according to the newspapers

849
01:26:14,455 --> 01:26:18,323
Be the case that could produce more  
riots in Hawaiian history

850
01:26:32,873 --> 01:26:35,338
Mr, Keane 
Is not worried about the charges?

851
01:26:35,909 --> 01:26:40,173
I am very upset 
But luckily I have to this company  news to look after my back

852
01:26:40,948 --> 01:26:44,249
Hope all this trial is  
removed by noon 
My only concern is

853
01:26:44,551 --> 01:26:49,254
Have someone psychiatric help  
this woman 
the need  -- Well, sorry gentlemen

854
01:26:49,957 --> 01:26:50,787
Excuse me please

855
01:26:54,361 --> 01:26:56,693
Margaret Keane is a figure  
published

856
01:26:56,897 --> 01:26:59,365
Wherefore must prove that the  
statements of our newspapers

857
01:26:59,566 --> 01:27:01,625
They are aware of probable falsity

858
01:27:01,902 --> 01:27:05,463
Now there is no evidence to suggest that  
our editors knew that these

859
01:27:05,672 --> 01:27:06,639
Assertions were not true

860
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:11,004
We would like to introduce 692 items  
in which

861
01:27:11,211 --> 01:27:13,812
The Ms, Keane 
Credited Mr, Keane

862
01:27:14,081 --> 01:27:16,549
As the painter called  
'' kids with big eyes "

863
01:27:27,227 --> 01:27:31,063
Few years ago these back? 
#The Ms, Keane has made these  statements

864
01:27:31,265 --> 01:27:32,163
since 1958

865
01:27:34,668 --> 01:27:36,226
This is a very strange case

866
01:27:37,871 --> 01:27:42,039
These paintings hang in museums  
all over the world 
Accredited Mr, Keane

867
01:27:43,343 --> 01:27:44,901
And true import

868
01:27:45,112 --> 01:27:48,377
The Ms, Keane has contributed immensely  
to confusion

869
01:27:50,284 --> 01:27:54,220
It seems impossible that such shares become  
the standard level for liability

870
01:27:55,022 --> 01:27:58,418
So the charge against  
is removed 
Thank you Your Honor

871
01:28:02,696 --> 01:28:05,729
Good luck Keane 
Good luck?  Where do they go?

872
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:09,428
We were accused of responsibility 
To you I was accused of slander

873
01:28:19,646 --> 01:28:23,439
Mr, Keane? 
#Seems to have no advice

874
01:28:24,484 --> 01:28:26,714
Would you like a moment to  
order their affairs?

875
01:28:29,156 --> 01:28:30,521
I've always careful to myself

876
01:28:30,724 --> 01:28:35,119
I do not need a group of suits  
hire to defend my good name 
Proceed!

877
01:28:49,142 --> 01:28:51,633
I was worried about my  
old friend Walter Keane

878
01:28:52,379 --> 01:28:54,438
The Hawaiian heat may have  
cooked his brain

879
01:28:55,082 --> 01:28:59,784
All he knows cuts  
and lawyers 
It comes from Perry Mason on TV

880
01:29:01,521 --> 01:29:04,217
I am the sole creator of my art

881
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:10,088
This is my life 
My contribution to the world

882
01:29:10,797 --> 01:29:14,458
Mr, Keane 
I told you should ask  question witnesses

883
01:29:15,202 --> 01:29:18,093
If you act as your own lawyer 
You can not make statements  at this time

884
01:29:18,438 --> 01:29:19,427
If, fine

885
01:29:21,308 --> 01:29:23,242
It is difficult to keep everything  
this in order

886
01:29:25,212 --> 01:29:26,076
Ms, Keane

887
01:29:26,647 --> 01:29:30,515
As expected someone to swallow  
his fantastic story?

888
01:29:31,018 --> 01:29:31,882
Mr, Keane

889
01:29:37,958 --> 01:29:42,185
Ms, Keane 
Seems to be a lucia

890
01:29:43,063 --> 01:29:48,025
And reasonably intelligent  
woman 
So as you can possibly

891
01:29:48,335 --> 01:29:51,327
Having come so far with a  
farce like that?

892
01:29:54,508 --> 01:29:56,066
I was forced to it

893
01:29:57,911 --> 01:29:59,173
You do tapeworms

894
01:30:02,716 --> 01:30:03,944
I had dominated the

895
01:30:05,452 --> 01:30:08,683
He was going crazy but you  
was what I wanted

896
01:30:09,589 --> 01:30:13,117
I was afraid and 
He saw no other option  so I followed the game

897
01:30:13,427 --> 01:30:15,361
I can remind you that this  
under oath?

898
01:30:19,266 --> 01:30:20,494
Just give me

899
01:30:21,702 --> 01:30:25,570
I allowed 
Take credit for big eyes

900
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:31,503
They were a reflection of my feelings 
And showed in the boy

901
01:30:32,345 --> 01:30:33,471
But I was weak

902
01:30:35,115 --> 01:30:37,515
No I thought I could leave  
and maintaining

903
01:30:38,518 --> 01:30:41,244
For myself and my daughter 
And he said

904
01:30:41,455 --> 01:30:44,447
Nobody would support payments without  
personality

905
01:30:47,227 --> 01:30:48,159
Maybe he was right

906
01:30:50,163 --> 01:30:52,891
You eras 
very talented

907
01:30:53,166 --> 01:30:54,258
To be charming

908
01:30:56,036 --> 01:30:58,664
And you're a genius in sales  
and promotion

909
01:31:01,308 --> 01:31:04,709
It seems that described two  
different men

910
01:31:06,213 --> 01:31:09,842
One is a sadistic ogre  
and the other

911
01:31:10,150 --> 01:31:13,979
A lovely gentleman 
That is you Walter

912
01:31:14,888 --> 01:31:18,023
You Jekyll Hyde 
That is a blatant statement

913
01:31:18,759 --> 01:31:21,155
I demand that the deleted  
log 
denied

914
01:31:21,895 --> 01:31:26,322
Now, you were cheeky 
Criticabas me constantly,  me you desgastabas

915
01:31:26,566 --> 01:31:30,932
Saying you'd kill me  
if he told the truth 
Well, now I do

916
01:31:31,138 --> 01:31:31,900
your Honor

917
01:31:32,939 --> 01:31:37,543
I ask for a mistrial 
You're a liar  do not even know what the truth

918
01:31:44,351 --> 01:31:45,648
This is not a domestic problem

919
01:31:46,753 --> 01:31:50,913
Perhaps it is 
But the rest of us have  interest in seeing as resolved

920
01:31:55,228 --> 01:31:57,162
I regret my excitement

921
01:31:59,966 --> 01:32:00,796
I am an artist

922
01:32:03,069 --> 01:32:03,831
maybe

923
01:32:05,772 --> 01:32:08,932
your Honor 
I call as my witness

924
01:32:09,709 --> 01:32:12,542
Mr, Walter Stanley Keane

925
01:32:19,586 --> 01:32:23,416
Swear to tell the truth and nothing  
but the truth? 
#Yes  -- May God help you

926
01:32:23,924 --> 01:32:24,754
Yes

927
01:32:32,999 --> 01:32:37,068
Mr, Keane 
There seems to be many hints

928
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:41,840
And conflicting testimony 
On the genesis of big eyes

929
01:32:42,342 --> 01:32:45,535
you mind 
Clarify this short

930
01:32:46,046 --> 01:32:48,105
Who gave life to these paintings?

931
01:32:53,687 --> 01:32:56,019
Well I created these children

932
01:33:00,894 --> 01:33:03,328
The choreography is not necessary,  
just sit and testify

933
01:33:12,439 --> 01:33:16,036
I had a wonderful life 
He was an artist

934
01:33:17,177 --> 01:33:21,474
And a friend of many  
celebrities 
however

935
01:33:21,681 --> 01:33:25,810
When I remember everything 
To define that really mattered

936
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:30,620
It was dedicated to the  
kids hungry world

937
01:33:33,727 --> 01:33:34,989
It all started in

938
01:33:36,129 --> 01:33:38,460
Berlin 
After World War II

939
01:33:38,965 --> 01:33:40,398
orphans

940
01:33:41,735 --> 01:33:45,531
They were chewing a bare wire 
their bodies

941
01:33:46,072 --> 01:33:47,130
lacerated

942
01:33:48,441 --> 01:33:51,936
His fingers wrinkled 
Her big eyes

943
01:33:54,648 --> 01:33:57,114
The Ms, Joan Crawford 
Made ,,  -- Mr, Keane!

944
01:33:57,684 --> 01:33:58,582
sit

945
01:33:59,753 --> 01:34:03,012
Marilyn Monroe 
I will not lie ,,,

946
01:34:03,490 --> 01:34:07,358
Jerry Louis calls me and tells me want  
I paint it to me and my family

947
01:34:07,827 --> 01:34:11,056
Miss, Natalie Wood 
I was approached

948
01:34:11,331 --> 01:34:12,298
And he said

949
01:34:12,799 --> 01:34:18,704
This is the best painting I've  
seen in my life!

950
01:34:19,472 --> 01:34:21,403
It ended 
I have not finished

951
01:34:21,608 --> 01:34:25,573
In fact if 
I can not stand one more story

952
01:34:25,779 --> 01:34:27,576
It is not testifying,  
He is wandering

953
01:34:27,847 --> 01:34:30,975
The court records are already quite  
full no nonsense stories

954
01:34:32,352 --> 01:34:34,513
We can stay here until  
die of old age but

955
01:34:34,788 --> 01:34:38,485
It is obvious that this case is summarized his  
word against that of Ms, Keane

956
01:34:39,192 --> 01:34:41,386
Mistrial? 
#Do Not! Not a mistrial!

957
01:34:43,363 --> 01:34:46,957
In my opinion 
There is only one way to clarify this

958
01:34:49,235 --> 01:34:50,532
Both paint

959
01:34:54,307 --> 01:34:57,105
Well bring them over here and put  
on both sides of the bench

960
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:14,524
Now, I do not seek a masterpiece 
I do not know much about these things

961
01:35:14,728 --> 01:35:18,397
I am a lawyer not a critical  
art 
But an hour is enough?

962
01:35:18,999 --> 01:35:19,988
If Your Honor

963
01:35:24,304 --> 01:35:27,967
Ok then 
Both have the same supplies

964
01:35:28,708 --> 01:35:31,566
So without further ado 
Ms, Keane, Mr, Keane

965
01:35:31,845 --> 01:35:32,777
The court is yours

966
01:36:40,847 --> 01:36:41,677
Mr, Keane?

967
01:36:45,118 --> 01:36:46,107
I just put the environment

968
01:36:48,555 --> 01:36:50,352
I hope the muse arrives

969
01:36:51,891 --> 01:36:54,086
Well his muse has 58 minutes

970
01:37:24,858 --> 01:37:26,325
Mr, Keane, right?

971
01:37:29,696 --> 01:37:33,097
My old shoulder injury  
I just go on, have a ,,,

972
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:35,765
that muscle

973
01:37:36,936 --> 01:37:39,136
I have been taking drugs 
Inflammation

974
01:37:56,122 --> 01:37:57,987
Do not think I can  
painting today

975
01:38:16,776 --> 01:38:21,309
The jury found in favor of  
Margaret Keane at all points 
Charges of defamation

976
01:38:21,581 --> 01:38:24,282
emotional stress 
And I hurt your reputation

977
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:28,280
Thank you, thank you very much

978
01:38:29,889 --> 01:38:31,584
Margaret, as you call  
painting?

979
01:38:33,726 --> 01:38:34,988
Show 224

980
01:38:38,331 --> 01:38:40,060
Margaret, you could give me  
your autograph?

981
01:38:42,669 --> 01:38:45,900
Two things he cared to Margaret,  
his daughter and his paintings

982
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:50,601
And after all the crazy twists  
his life took 
He loved the final

983
01:38:50,843 --> 01:38:51,810
for both

984
01:39:01,154 --> 01:39:03,486
Walter never accepted defeat, he insisted  
who was the true artist

985
01:39:04,090 --> 01:39:07,150
For the rest of his life, died  
in 2000, bitter and penniless

986
01:39:08,294 --> 01:39:13,027
Never produced another painting

987
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:17,094
Margaret found personal happiness  
and remarried

988
01:39:17,370 --> 01:39:21,397
After many years in Hawaii, moved  
San Francisco and opened a new gallery

989
01:39:24,978 --> 01:39:31,611
She still paints every day

990
01:39:34,611 --> 01:39:38,611
