34
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,260
    YOUR MOTHER, MOLL FLANDERS,

35
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:25,931
                WAS A MURDERESS,
                WAS A MOTHER,
                AND A THIEF

36
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:28,000
            BY HER OWN ACCOUNT.

37
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,069
        THE LOSS OF HER SOUL,
        TO SOME,

38
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,804
WAS OF AS LITTLE CONSEQUENCE

39
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,940
          AS AN EMBER
          DRAFTING UP A CHIMNEY.

40
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:39,111
         I AM INSTRUCTED
         BY A WEALTHY BENEFACTOR

41
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,813
         TO OFFER YOU THE CHANCE
         TO ACCOMPANY ME.

42
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,516
              IN RETURN FOR YOUR
              BOARD AND KEEP,

43
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,185
        I AM TO READ YOU THIS--

44
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,988
        THE FIRSTHAND MEMOIRS
        OF YOUR MOTHER.

45
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,991
      YOUR BENEFACTOR HOPES THAT
      YOU MIGHT...

46
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,927
NOTE ANY SEEDS OF HER CHARACTER

47
00:04:55,962 --> 00:05:00,432
        THAT MIGHT TRY TO...
        ROOT IN YOU.

48
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,569
    DO YOU UNDERSTAND MY WORDS?

49
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,205
      SHE DOESN'T RESPOND
      TO WORDS.

50
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,308
I'LL RESPOND TO ANYBODY
THAT TREATS ME

51
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,910
  LIKE I'VE GOT A SOUL
  AS GOOD AS THEM.

52
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:16,048
            INDEED, THERE IS
            MUCH OF HER IN YOU.

53
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,828
  WHAT IS IT?

54
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:32,364
I WAS SEPARATED FROM
A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF COIN

55
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:35,167
ON THE GROUNDS THAT ONLY SILK
WOULD SUFFICE.

56
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,842
            ARE YOU TAKING ME
            INTO SIN?

57
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,778
     I'LL SPEND TEN ETERNITIES--
YOU MAY REST EASY.

58
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,782
CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE TAUGHT ME
THAT A MAN'S ETHICS

59
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:54,653
ARE THE ONLY POSSESSIONS
HE'LL TAKE BEYOND THE GRAVE.

00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,453
          THERE'S NOT MANY

     YOU HAVE A REASON TO STAY?

414
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:37,067
DO I HAVE A CHOICE?

415
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:41,705
THEN I SHALL HAVE TO
TAKE MY CHANCES WITH
YOUR MISTRESS, SHAN'T I?

416
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:46,143
 I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN FOR YOU.

                  OH, REALLY.

424
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,660
THEY SAY THIS
IS JUST A CHANNEL,

425
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:39,029
AND IT GETS WORSE
IN THE ATLANTIC.

426
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,842
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
MY MOTHER WAS EVIL. AWFUL.

427
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:56,146
I SHALL NEVER FOLLOW
IN HER FOOTSTEPS.
DOES THAT SATISFY YOU?

428
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,448
    SO THROW AWAY THE CROSS.

429
00:31:58,483 --> 00:31:59,583
    WHAT?

430
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,888
IF YOU REJECT HER,
THEN THROW AWAY THE CRUCIFIX.

431
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:08,792
IT'S THE ONLY THING
I HAVE OF HERS.

432
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,597
            THEN I MUST ON

00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,824
 FETCH MY GOWN.

530
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:53,229
 <i>NO,</i> THE BLUE ONE.

531
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,832
IT'S SUNDAY.
CAN'T WEAR RED ON SUNDAY.

532
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,635
MOTHER OF GOD,
YOU'LL HAVE THE BLUE-NOSES
DOWN ON US.

533
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,270
            FOR WEARING RED?

534
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:03,573
FOR EVERYTHING
THEM AND THEIR WOMEN ARE NOT.

535
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,975
I'VE GOTTA TAKE YOU IN HAND.

536
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,778
             HMM.

537
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:12,282
 A MAN'S NOTHING BUT A BULL...

538
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:15,085
        BEAST OF LUST.

539
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,789
SAY ANYTHING, DO ANYTHING
TO EASE HIS URGES.

540
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:24,828
  GOD'S NOT MADE A MAN
  FIT TO BE WOVEN UP WITH YET.

541
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,663
BUT THERE'S PRECIOUS FEW WOMEN

542
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,467
     WHO LEARN TO LEAD THEM
     BY THE NOSE.

543
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:35,004
THESE ARE THE MOST AWESOME
WEAPONS YOU HAVE, GIRL.

544
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,140
         PROP THEM UP,

545
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:41,277
 AND A MAN WON'T BE ABLE
 TO RAISE HIS EYES TO YOUR FACE.

546
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,446
  SIT DOWN.

547
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:52,689
SOME OF THE FINEST GENTLEMEN
IN LONDON COME THROUGH MY DOORS.

548
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,859
WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO
HAVE POWER OVER SUCH MEN?

549
00:39:55,893 --> 00:40:01,231
SO ALL THEY COULD THINK OF
WAS WORSHIPPING YOUR YOUNG BODY?

550
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:04,300
         I WAS RAISED CATHOLIC.

551
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,537
SO WAS THE VIRGIN MARY,
AND DON'T TELL ME
SHE DIDN'T DO IT.

552
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,938
              THAT'S BLASPHEMY.

553
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:12,108
NO, THAT'S COMMON SENSE,
GIRL.

554
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,644
WHAT ARE YOU
SAVING YOURSELF FOR?

555
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:17,080
GIVE YOURSELF SOME PLEASURE.

556
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:21,050
LIFE'S TERRIBLE SHORT FOR SOME.

557
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:25,722
YOU NEVER BEEN KISSED, I'LL BET.

558
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,258
  AND WHY?

559
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:31,594
TWO FLAT PIECES OF FISH

560
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:36,499
WHERE THERE OUGHT TO BE
A RED RING OF ALLURE.

561
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:43,206
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE
THE INNOCENCE OF A DOLL.

562
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,609
THEY WANTS THE CHILD IN YOU.

563
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,013
AND THE EYES.

564
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:54,083
TEASE THEM DOWN THERE
WITH YOUR EYES.

565
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:58,955
WHEN A MAN'S PART GOES HARD,
HIS BRAIN GOES SOFT.

566
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:03,259
THAT'S WHEN THEY'LL SAY
OR DO ANYTHING TO POSSESS YOU.

567
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,463
THAT'S WHEN YOU FEEL THE POWER.

568
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,767
         DID YOU HAVE THIS POWER
         OVER SOMEONE?

569
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:16,139
 <i>EVERY</i> MAN WHO COMES
 THROUGH MY DOOR.

570
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:22,812
                         MOLL.

571
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,825
WAS SHE BULLING YOU
ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

572
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,661
        NO. NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

573
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,463
    THANKS.

574
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,602
EDNA AND ME...

575
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:48,838
WELL, IT'S NOT LOVE.

576
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:52,609
WE HAVE AN EAR FOR
EACH OTHER'S TROUBLES,
YOU KNOW?

577
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:56,980
SHE'S NOT SO YOUNG ANYMORE.

578
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,716
I DON'T WANT THE MISTRESS
AFTER HER.

579
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,784
             WHAT WOULD SHE DO?

580
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,820
SHE'S CAPABLE OF ANYTHING.

581
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,989
        ( door opens )

582
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:10,527
THERE'S NO HEART
IN THE WOMAN.

583
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,795
                     ( sighs )

584
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:17,000
ESCAPED FROM CARDIFF
PRISON HULKS, I DID.

585
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:20,703
WITH A HIGHWAY ALCHEMIST
NAMED GAY.

586
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,776
OH. HE COULD TURN THE LEAD
IN HIS PISTOLS TO GOLD.

587
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,413
MRS. ALLWORTHY
WAS HIS ACQUAINTANCE.

588
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,949
SHE HID HIM AND ME.

589
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:36,553
BUT HE DIED FROM A SHOT
HE TOOK WHILE ESCAPING.

590
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:41,024
FOR A WHILE, SHE AND I...

591
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:46,362
LORD, MAKES ME STRANGE
TO SAY THE WORDS.

592
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:51,367
WE SHARED THE SAME BED.

593
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,805
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I DONE WRONG,

594
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,974
BUT SHE TURNED ON ME.

595
00:42:58,008 --> 00:42:59,776
    SUDDEN.

596
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,314
SHE WON'T TOUCH ME,

597
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:07,584
BUT SHE WON'T SET ME FREE.

598
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,218
    HERE.

599
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,658
      THIEF.

600
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:19,562
ONE WORD FROM HER
AND MY OWN SKIN WILL HANG ME.

601
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:25,201
             I'VE GOT THIS THING
             IN MY HEAD.

602
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:27,236
  WHAT THING?

603
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:30,707
 IF THE LIKES OF MRS. ALLWORTHY

604
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,810
             CAN HAVE THE GENTRY
             DANCE TO HER TUNE,

605
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:37,246
    I COULD HAVE EVERYTHING--
  NO, MOLL, NO.

606
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:43,286
A WORD FROM AN OLD PILGRIM:
GET YOURSELF OUT OF HERE.

607
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,456
FIND A FARMER.
BE A MILLINER'S WIFE.

608
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:49,325
HAVE A COMMON MAN
COME HOME TO YOU, LASS.

609
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,630
DON'T TRAVEL HER ROAD.
NO GOOD CAN COME OF IT.

610
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:57,700
    WITH HER MONEY,
    I'D KNOW HOW TO BE HAPPY.

611
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:59,335
         ( footsteps )

612
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,305
MR. HIBBLE!
OH, LORD, COME QUICK!

613
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:07,310
COME ON, LADIES, COME ON.
STAND ASIDE, STAND ASIDE.

614
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:08,678
            ( crying )

615
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:10,279
             WHAT'S HAPPENED?

616
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,247
      POLLY KILLED THE PIE MAN.

617
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:12,649
         SHE MURDERED HIM?

618
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,617
NAH, THE OLD GEEZER
WOULD GIVE US A PIE OR TWO

619
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,019
FOR A TWIST IN THE LARDER.

620
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,054
         CAN'T TOUCH HIM
         CAN'T TOUCH--

621
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:22,325
        DAMN, POLLY, NOW WE
        AIN'T NEVER GONNA GET
        ANY DECENT FOOD.

622
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:27,330
AW, BUT YOU SHOULD LOOK
AT THE SMILE ON HIS FACE.

623
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:33,036
         ( laughter )

624
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:36,372
Mrs. Allworthy: FIVE GUINEAS?

00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:49,905
        HELLO.

802
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:54,042
ALL I COULD FIND WAS WHISKEY.

803
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,111
            IT'S ALL RIGHT.

804
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:03,952
     DON'T TOUCH THAT.
              WHY NOT?

805
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,956
        OH, GOD!

806
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:29,978
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
        YOU'RE GONNA KILL ME!

807
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:32,681
NO. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
                PLEASE DON'T!

808
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:34,950
    YOU'RE NOT GONNA HURT ME?
     NO.

809
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:37,386
NOT UNLESS I FALL ON YOU.

810
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,587
                    TRUE?

811
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,088
     YES.

812
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,957
                YOU BASTARD!

813
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:44,893
        YOU SCARED ME TO DEATH!

814
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:48,096
I MAY BE AN IGNORANT TROLLOP,
BUT I STILL GOT FEELINGS,
YOU KNOW.

815
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:52,468
I APOLOGIZE.
SPEECH IS NOT
MY FIRST LANGUAGE.

816
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:57,206
I ATTEMPT TO MAKE A LIVING
DOING THESE STUDIES.

817
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:01,310
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
I'M AN ARTIST OR A SCIENTIST.

818
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:03,912
LIFE FASCINATES ME.

819
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:06,315
EVERYTHING HAS A PURPOSE.

820
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:10,886
THE WAY OUR HEARTS WORK,
THE WAY OUR VERY BLOOD FLOWS
AROUND OUR BODY

821
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,522
ALL FITS TOGETHER
IN A BRILLIANT SYSTEM.

822
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:20,696
BUT PART OF ME REALLY YEARNS
TO CATCH WHAT TRULY ANIMATES

823
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:23,532
  OUR HUMAN CLAY.

824
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:28,604
            WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

825
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:31,573
I WANT TO SEE WHO
I REALLY BOUGHT.

826
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:33,208
                        WHY?

827
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,511
BECAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE
A DROWNED CLOWN.

828
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:37,179
                     SO DO YOU.

829
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,364
THERE USED TO BE MORE OF ME.

830
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:57,733
            BUT THE BOOZE
            IS THINNING ME DOWN.

831
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:04,306
         MUST HAVE DRANK HIMSELF
         TO DEATH.

832
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,041
                  ( chuckles )

833
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:08,877
COULD YOU PLEASE
KEEP A LITTLE MORE STILL?

834
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:13,682
    I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU SLEEP.

835
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,784
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

836
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:18,987
            WITH ALL THESE
            DEAD FOLKS' PARTS
            LYING AROUND.

837
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:22,357
    WHAT KIND OF PERSON
    WOULD LET YOU CUT THEM UP
    LIKE SUNDAY JOINTS?

838
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,493
PEOPLE WILL THEM TO SCIENCE.

839
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:26,461
                 WELL, THIS BODY
                 AIN'T WILLING.

840
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:29,431
     NO MATTER HOW CHEAP IT GOES
     WHEN IT'S ALIVE.

841
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:32,367
        YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD,
        ARE YOU?

842
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,336
             I DON'T HAVE AN EGG
             FOR A HEAD.

843
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:35,938
I'M ONLY STARTING.

844
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:38,273
IT'S REMBRANDT'S
LINES OF FORM.

845
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:43,011
        I WOULDN'T COPY HIM,
        NOT IF HE PAINTED PEOPLE
        WITH EGGS FOR HEADS.

846
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:46,114
DO YOU REALLY NOT KNOW
WHO REMBRANDT IS?

847
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:48,483
            NOT EVEN IF
            I'D SLEPT WITH HIM.

848
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:50,919
     MAYBE THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

849
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:53,188
            YOU CAN'T LIVE
            SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE.

850
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:54,756
         YOU'VE GOT TO DO THINGS
         YOUR OWN WAY.

851
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:58,427
PLEASE, SIT DOWN
AND LET ME SEE
WHAT I'VE PAID FOR.

852
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:24,987
A CARRIAGE?
HAVE YOU LEFT YOUR SENSES?

853
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:26,755
          FOUND 'EM, MORE LIKE.

854
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:30,659
DIDN'T I WARN YOU?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR FEET?
                    NOTHING!

855
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:34,162
        HE WANTS ME EVERY NIGHT
        FOR THE NEXT FORTNIGHT.

856
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:35,998
        A CARRIAGE EACH WAY.

857
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:37,065
        YOU?

858
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,968
            ( coins jingle )
                    ME.

859
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:45,173
        WHATEVER YOU DID TO HIM,
        TEACH IT TO THE OTHERS.

860
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:47,643
I NEVER TOUCHED HIM.

861
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:53,982
     I'M SHIVERING.
     I'VE GOT BLOODY GOOSEBUMPS.

862
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:04,326
                  ( chuckles )

863
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:09,431
    MISSED.

864
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,466
         I WASN'T AIMING AT YOU.
YES, YOU WERE.

865
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,101
                  WEREN'T.

866
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:18,006
          DID I MISS THAT TIME?

867
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,808
WOULD YOU PLEASE
SIT STILL?

868
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:22,644
                 I TOLD YOU,
                 I'M FREEZING.

869
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,346
                 IT'S FREEZING.

870
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:31,720
JUST SIT THERE...
AND HOLD THIS.

871
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:50,539
    IT LOOKS JUST LIKE
    A MIRROR OF ME.

872
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:54,276
          IT'S GOOD?

873
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:55,711
( dejected )
BRILLIANT.

874
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:57,512
        IT'S NOT GOOD?

875
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,915
IT'S JUST...

876
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:05,053
IT'S JUST SO DAMN
MECHANICAL!

877
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:07,089
          I'M THERE.

878
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:12,327
YES, THIS MUSCLE
IS CONNECTED TO THIS TISSUE...

879
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:16,898
DA VINCI COULD HAVE MADE
YOUR EYE DANCE WITH
A TOUCH OF LIGHT FROM HIS BRUSH,

880
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:20,168
BUT HE WASN'T PAINTING
THE THING, THE BODY,

881
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:23,672
HE WAS CAPTURING ITS...
ITS SPIRIT.

882
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:32,647
         WELL, THE SPIRITS IN ME
         COST TUPPENCE A QUART,
         LOVE.

883
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:37,586
( chuckles )
YOU'VE THE DEVIL'S SPIRIT
IN YOU, ALL RIGHT.

884
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:40,322
         THERE'S NOTHING IN ME.

885
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:42,624
              HARD LIKE A ROCK.

886
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:45,060
                THAT WAY THERE'S
                NOTHING INSIDE
                TO GET CONFUSED.

887
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,596
AND THE MOON IS MADE
OF GREEN CHEESE.

888
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,101
          COME.

889
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:06,114
        YOU SEE THE RESTRICTIONS
        OF YOUR MORTAL BODY?

890
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,719
            CLOSE YOUR EYES.

891
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:17,459
                INSIDE YOU...

892
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:20,529
         THERE'S SO MUCH SPACE.

893
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:23,632
                 THE COSMOS.

894
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:25,634
                YOU SEE?

895
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:32,474
     INSIDE, YOU GO ON FOREVER.

896
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:39,080
     I'M STONE.

897
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:46,822
YOU WANT TO PAINT
ANOTHER ONE?

898
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:48,824
                          NO.

899
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:51,226
I'M JUST THE WRONG WOMAN.

900
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,862
  IT'S NOT YOU.

901
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:59,167
    I DON'T THINK THESE HANDS
    WILL EVER CAPTURE YOU.

902
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:04,573
 YOU'RE A KIND MAN.

903
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:12,013
     ( thunder crashing )

904
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,357
             Driver: WHOA.

905
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:27,596
                 GIDDYUP.

906
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:50,652
                 HELLO?

907
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:58,560
     HELLO?
                         HELLO.

908
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:01,096
      AAAH!

909
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:05,100
                 THAT'S THE LAST
                 OF THEM.

910
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:08,103
          TEACH HER THE LESSON.

911
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:33,295
             Moll:
             I DIDN'T KNOW
             WHERE ELSE TO GO.

912
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,202
WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

913
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:43,471
                    IT HAPPENS.

914
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:10,065
  CAREFUL, JONATHAN,
  THIS IS NO STRAY KITTEN.

915
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:13,468
  YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
  KIND OF PERSON YOU'RE
  LETTING IN YOUR HOUSE.

916
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:17,672
STRANGELY, I FIND
THE MYSTERY INTRIGUING.

917
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:22,477
SEND FOR ME IF SHE
HAS ANY SIGN OF TREMORS.

918
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:26,848
OTHERWISE,
IT'LL BE A BAD FEW DAYS
BEFORE SHE'S COMFORTABLE.

919
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:34,856
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

920
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:37,625
                I NEED A DRINK.

921
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,694
THAT'S THE LAST THING
YOU NEED.

922
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:41,329
            DAMN YOU, DO YOU
            KNOW HOW I FEEL?

923
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:45,734
ANGRY, FRIGHTENED, LOST--
THAT'S HOW I'D FEEL.

924
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:47,335
        I'M NOT YOUR FRIEND.

925
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,804
      HE'S RIGHT, YOU DON'T NEED
      MY KIND IN YOUR HOUSE.

926
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,639
    GENTLY.

927
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,842
IS IT ME YOU DON'T TRUST?

928
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:56,211
YOU'RE HURT. STAY.

929
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:58,747
             I WON'T HAVE A MAN
             TELL ME WHAT TO DO!

930
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:00,648
ALL RIGHT THEN,
PLEASE STAY.

931
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:01,583
                  NO.

932
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:04,352
LEAVE THEN.
BANISH YOURSELF.

933
01:07:05,888 --> 01:07:08,289
     I'M TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO.
     DO YOU HEAR ME?

934
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:12,660
MY LIFE'S NOT SOME GAME.

935
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,562
              MINE NEITHER.

936
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:18,233
            WELL...GOOD-BYE.

937
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:28,777
DAMN YOU. I HAVEN'T GOT
ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO!

938
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:30,945
    I'LL SLEEP ON THE FLOOR.

939
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,915
NO, I'LL SLEEP ON THE FLOOR.

940
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:41,489
        YOU ARE THE MOST
        CONTENTIOUS PERSON
        I'VE EVER MET!

941
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:44,592
YOU HAVEN'T LIVED MUCH
THEN, HAVE YOU?

WELL,
THAT'S YOUR INCOME.

960
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:52,287
FROM THE LOOKS OF
YOUR SCRAWNY BODY
AND THIS PLACE,

961
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:55,323
YOU HAVEN'T GOT TWO PENCE
TO RUB TOGETHER.

962
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:58,760
YOU'RE A DESPERATE MAN
TO PAY TO PAINT ME,
I'LL TELL YA THAT.

963
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:00,728
             BUT EVERYTHING'S ON
             THE SURFACE, MOLL.

964
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:03,665
    THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS
    OF DESPERATION.

965
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,867
LIKE WHAT?

966
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:09,370
        Artist:
        THE MAD HERMIT THAT I AM

967
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:12,740
  LIVED A WILD LIFE AS A CHILD.

968
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:17,245
        I MADE WINGS FROM CANVAS
        AND BAMBOO.

969
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:23,885
     I WISHED TO NAVIGATE
     THE ATMOSPHERE LIKE A BIRD.

970
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:30,191
      INSTEAD, I STUDIED GRAVITY
      AND PLUNGED 40 FEET FROM
      THE MILL ROOF.

971
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,595
  MY BODY LAY STATIC FOR WEEKS,

972
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:36,397
          BUT MY MIND TRAVELED
          TO PLACES IN FEVERS

973
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:38,533
     THAT ARE STILL VIVID IN ME.

974
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:42,637
            ONE MAN CAME
            AND WAS BY MY SIDE
            DAY AND NIGHT,

975
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:45,707
        A VERY OLD DOCTOR,

976
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:49,077
            TOUCHED, I AM TOLD,
            BY MY INVENTIVENESS.

977
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:54,682
          HE EXHAUSTED HIMSELF.

978
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:05,526
I'M STILL HERE, OLD MAN.

979
01:11:08,464 --> 01:11:11,299
STILL TESTING THE WINDS,

980
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,201
        THANKS TO YOU.

981
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:20,441
MY PARENTS TREATED ME
AS AN INVALID.

982
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:22,810
FREQUENTLY I WOULD
GET SICKLY

983
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:25,647
JUST TO REINFORCE
THEIR SMOTHERINGS.

984
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:30,318
I CAME TO LONDON
TO BECOME A KNIGHT OF MEDICINE.

985
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:36,157
BUT MY STAMINA IS INSUFFICIENT
FOR THE WORK OF A PHYSICIAN,

986
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:41,663
SO I DEDICATED MY DRAWING
TO HELPING THOSE WHO ARE
BETTER SPECIMENS.

987
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:44,599
  ( bird calls in distance )

988
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,968
 THAT CHILD IN ME

989
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:50,038
 YEARNED TO CREATE
 THE EXTRAORDINARY--

990
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:51,673
  A PARTHENON,

991
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:54,842
A SISTINE CHAPEL.

992
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:58,646
     AND NOW...

993
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:01,582
I THINK I'D SETTLE
FOR CREATING ANYTHING

994
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:04,052
 THAT WOULD GIVE ME
 A SENSE OF COMPLETION.

995
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:09,991
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM LIFE, MOLL?

996
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:13,861
            NOTHIN' ANYMORE.

997
01:12:13,896 --> 01:12:17,065
COME ON, MOLL.
I BARE MY SOUL--

998
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:18,333
          AND I BARE MY BOSOMS.

999
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:21,703
WE MAKE A GOOD PAIR.

1000
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:25,006
        ( loud chatter
        and laughter )

1001
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,250
                    MOLL.

1002
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:39,787
     NOW, THERE'S A SIGHT.
        CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU
        PRIVATE-LIKE?

1003
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:40,955
         YEAH.

1004
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:46,861
HIBBLE, WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU?

1005
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:53,234
  MOLL, THINGS AIN'T GONE RIGHT.
  WHAT'S WRONG?

1006
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:59,006
HELLO, MOLLY.

1007
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:02,810
DRIVEN OFF BY
THE GUARDIANS OF MORALS,
WE WERE.

1008
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:07,648
LOST MY HOUSE, MY GIRLS...

1009
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:12,620
GETTING OUT OF NEWGATE
COST ME MY COMFORT, GIRL,

1010
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,922
MY FAITHFUL DOG.

1011
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:18,459
SHE'S LOOKING SO GOOD.

1012
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:20,561
ISN'T SHE, HIBBLE?

1013
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:23,264
SO NICELY ATTIRED.

1014
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:28,503
I THINK SHE'S BEEN FINDING
WHILE WE'VE BEEN LOSING.

1015
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:30,538
    WHAT DO YOU WANT?

1016
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:32,373
 I TOOK YOU IN.

1017
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:34,776
PUT A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD.

1018
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:38,279
KEPT YOU WHILE YOU WAS
ON THE BOOZE.

1019
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:42,583
NOW YOU'RE COMING BACK,
AND YOU'RE GONNA WORK FOR ME.

1020
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:45,420
            I'M BEYOND YOU NOW.

1021
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:47,955
COME WITH ME OR I'LL PUT YOU
BEYOND EVERYTHING.

1022
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:51,159
        MOLL,
        SHE DIDN'T TELL ME THIS.

1023
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:52,527
I MEAN IT.

1024
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:56,464
WHAT'S GOING ON,
MOLL?
  IS THAT YOUR BUSINESS?

1025
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:58,833
         MORE THAN YOU THINK.

1026
01:13:58,867 --> 01:14:01,803
            OH, YOU GOT YOURSELF
            A LOVER BOY, MOLLY.

1027
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:04,172
             HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED
             ABOUT MEN YET?

1028
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:07,775
      HE'LL BURN YOU.
      YOU'RE BETTER OFF WITH ME.

1029
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:11,412
DON'T DOUBT I WILL USE THIS.

1030
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:14,949
    ONE SMALL SHOT LIKE THAT,
    SO FEW GRAINS OF POWDER,

1031
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:16,851
            MIGHT KILL ME,
            MOST LIKELY NOT.

1032
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:19,720
        BUT I SWEAR
        I'LL LIVE LONG ENOUGH

1033
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:22,824
     TO RUN THIS BLADE
     THROUGH YOUR BODY SIX TIMES

1034
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:26,794
    AND DANCE UPON YOUR GRAVE
    BEFORE I DROP.

  SOMEONE GET A MAGISTRATE!

1036

              NOT TODAY.

1037
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:37,505
    YOU AIN'T WORTH MY SPIT.

1038
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:39,874
LET ALONE MY NECK.

1039
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:42,443
I'LL HAVE MEMORY OF THIS.
YOU'LL PAY ME.

1040
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,846
                 I ALREADY DID.

1041
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:51,419
 MOLL, I'M SORRY.

1042
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:54,055
         HERE, HAVE SOME BREAD.

1043
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:55,690
I'M SORRY.

1044
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:03,030
                  WAS THAT GUN
                  THAT USELESS?

1045
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:05,099
        I LIED.

1046

         AND...

1047

RATHER WELL, I THOUGHT.

1048
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:25,019
         WELL?

1049
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:27,488
TAKE YOUR BOOTS OFF.

1050
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:28,823

THERE. BACK WHERE IT WAS.

        TO KNOW.
 IT'S HER I DON'T TRUST.

1075
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:15,496
            IT'S ALL A MISTAKE.

1076
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:17,398
EITHER I WANT YOU COMMITTED,

1077
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:19,133
OR I WANT YOU
TO FREE YOURSELF NOW.

1078
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:21,569
                     COMMITTED?

1079
01:17:21,603 --> 01:17:23,971
    TO ME.
                         WHAT?!

1080
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:28,743
EVERY NIGHT
WHEN YOU'RE ASLEEP,

1081
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:31,012
 I LOOK AT YOU

1082
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:36,183
AND I FEAR ONE THING--
THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE HERE.

1083
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:42,089
          DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
          I'M GOING TO FAIL YOU.

1084
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:43,257
I CAN ACCEPT THAT.

1085
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:45,359
                 NO, FEEL THAT!

1086
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:48,129
            THAT'S NOTHING
            COMPARED TO THE PAIN
            THAT COMES WITH ME!

1087
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:49,263
LET ME LOVE YOU.

1088
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:51,098
      DO I HIDE WHEN YOUR FAMILY
      COME TO VISIT?

1089
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:53,134
I'LL TELL THEM EVERYTHING
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

1090
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,469
         "THEY HUNG HER MOTHER."
         FEEL <i>THAT!</i>

1091
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,872
            "SHE SLEPT WITH
            HUNDREDS OF MEN!"
            FEEL <i>THAT!</i>

1092
01:17:57,906 --> 01:18:01,008
            "SHE'S A BITCH
            AND A TROLLOP!"
            AND I HATE YOU!

1093
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:06,213
            THIS IS MADNESS!

1094
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:15,189
              FORGOT ME BLEEDIN'
              STUPID SHOES.

1095
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:17,725
PUT THEM UNDER THE BED,
MOLL.

1096
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:58,899
          <i>"I'D HAD SEX</i>
     <i>WITH MANY A MAN,</i>

1097
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:03,270
  <i>"BUT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME</i>
         <i>I'D MADE LOVE.</i>

1103
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:24,792
            IS SOMETHING WRONG?

1104
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:31,932
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
I HAD TO BE RICH
TO OWN THE STARS.

1105
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:39,106
                     MOLL...

1106
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:44,278
      I WANT YOU TO BE MY WIFE.

1107
01:19:46,848 --> 01:19:49,483
WAKE ME UP IN THE MORNING
AND SAY THAT.

1108
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,318
                    I MEAN IT.

1109
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:06,500
WE'LL SEE
IF THERE'S SOME CHANCE
WITH YOUR FAMILY FIRST.

1110
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:10,137
THEN I'LL ANSWER.

1111
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:13,507
                 IF YOU SAY SO.

1112
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:27,488
                  FEELING COLD?

1113
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:32,359
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M FEELING.

1114
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:34,829
      ( sheep bleating )

1115
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:46,841
                WELCOME!
                WELCOME HOME!

1116
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:49,643
IS THAT YOUR FATHER?
IS THAT HIM?

1117
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:52,246
        NO, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
        THAT EASY, MOLL.

1118
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,814
         WELCOME HOME!

1119
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:56,350
      THE MASTER'S HOME!

1120
01:20:58,453 --> 01:21:00,688
        STEADY, BOY, STEADY.

1121
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,473
                WHOA, WHOA.

1122
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:23,611
      NO.

1123
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:25,145
                        YES.

1124
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,648
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

1125
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:30,918
      WELL, THIS WAS <i>YOUR</i> IDEA.

1126
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:35,422
      OH, GOD.

1127
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:46,066
NO, THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

1128
01:21:51,773 --> 01:21:53,908
THIS IS MOLL FLANDERS.

1129
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:55,643
 HELLO.
    NO, MOLL.

1130
01:21:55,677 --> 01:21:58,012
THIS IS MY MOTHER,
AND THIS IS MY SISTER
CHARLOTTE.

1131
01:21:58,046 --> 01:22:00,080
        IT'S A PLEASURE
        TO MEET YOU FORMALLY.

1132
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:02,983
  THE PAINTINGS--
  I FEEL LIKE WE'VE ALREADY MET.

1133
01:22:03,018 --> 01:22:05,986
YEAH, WELL, I'M SURE YOU'VE
NEARLY SEEN ALL OF ME.

1134
01:22:06,021 --> 01:22:08,956
            YOUR FATHER WILL BE
            JOINING US. PLEASE.

1135
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:15,529
         WELL, AT LEAST HIS BODY
         IS WORKING WELL.

1136
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:24,038
      Servant:
      IS THERE ANYTHING
      YOU WOULD WISH FOR, MA'AM?

1137
01:22:24,072 --> 01:22:27,408
                     Moll: NO.
        WE'LL HAVE SOME WINE.

1138
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:30,244
YOU KNOW HOW YOUR FATHER
FEELS ABOUT ALCOHOL.

1139
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:31,745
         SOME RED WINE, GARETH.

1140
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,814
            I BROUGHT IT WITH ME
            IN THE CARRIAGE.

1141
01:22:33,848 --> 01:22:37,818
          MOLL, LET ME EXPLAIN
          THE LITTLE HYPOCRISIES
          OF MY FAMILY.

1142
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:43,757
 ALL THIS COMES FROM THE SUCCESS
 OF THE FAMILY'S BREWERIES.

1143
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,826
     IT IS
     AN HONEST BUSINESS.

1144
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:49,229
         PROFITING FROM THE SINS
         OF THE LITTLE MAN.

1145
01:22:49,264 --> 01:22:52,633
WHAT SCHOOL DID YOU GO TO,
MISS FLANDERS?

1146
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:55,636
            UM, CONVENT OF
            THE SACRED HEART.

1147
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:58,505
        NICE PLACE, SORT OF.

1148
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:00,808
IT PROVIDES WORK
FOR THE INDOLENT.

1149
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:02,943
 IT IS AN HONEST BUSINESS.

1150
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:08,916
  BUT PLEASE, LET US NOT
  SPOIL WHAT IS TRUTHFULLY
  A WONDROUS OCCASION.

1151
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:13,554
MY SON HAS RETURNED HOME.

1152
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:16,590
SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN AWAY.

1153
01:23:16,624 --> 01:23:19,360
      BUT WE CAN SHARE
      ALL THAT LATER.

1154
01:23:19,394 --> 01:23:23,163
     BUT GOD SO HELP ME,
     IF YOU...

1155
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:25,132
    WANTED A WOMAN AT LAST,

1156
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,768
     SURELY YOU COULD HAVE
     PAID FOR ONE.

1157
01:23:27,802 --> 01:23:32,840
    OH, I DID.
    MOLL IS MY MODEL.

1158
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:36,010
        AND MY FIANCEE.

1159
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:40,447
FOR A FEW PENNIES,
SHE'S HELPED ME FIND MYSELF--

1160
01:23:40,482 --> 01:23:42,683
          AN EXPERIENCE
          YOU'VE DENIED ME

1161
01:23:42,717 --> 01:23:45,352
          FOR THE DURATION
          OF MY EXISTENCE.

1162
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:48,389
         PATIENCE.

1163
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:53,827
    Mother: MY DEAR...

1164
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:58,732
  IT'S OBVIOUS MY SON
  FINDS YOU VERY ATTRACTIVE.

1165
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:02,703
    WHATEVER YOU WISH--

1166
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:04,738
         NAME IT.

1167
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:07,408
A THOUSAND GUINEAS?

1168
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:11,745
FIVE THOUSAND?
TEN THOUSAND?

1169
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:18,218
        HERE.

1170
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:21,989
 THIS IS WORTH MORE THAN
 YOU COULD EARN IN A LIFETIME.

1171
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,695
YOU CAN BUY YOURSELF
A FUTURE

1172
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:32,399
WITHOUT TAKING MY SON'S AWAY.

1173
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:43,177
  ALL MY LIFE I'VE DREAMT
  OF OWNING SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1174
01:24:44,646 --> 01:24:47,448
FUNNY, I THOUGHT I'D FEEL MORE.

1175
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:54,588
             I KNOW WHO I AM...
             AND WHAT I'VE BEEN.

1176
01:24:54,622 --> 01:24:56,490
          AND SO DOES YOUR SON.

1177
01:24:56,524 --> 01:25:01,962
    I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE
    THERE'D BE SOME CHANCE
    I'D FIT INTO YOUR FAMILY.

1178
01:25:01,996 --> 01:25:05,432
      THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ME
      THE PROUDEST LIVING THING.

1179
01:25:07,469 --> 01:25:10,804
      BUT NO ONE CAN SEPARATE ME
      FROM THIS MAN.

1180
01:25:10,839 --> 01:25:13,941
    UNLESS HE TELLS ME
    HE WANTS ME TO LEAVE HIM.

1181
01:25:13,975 --> 01:25:16,944
              I LOVE HIM ENOUGH
              TO DO THAT.

1182
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:19,713
     BUT YOU CAN'T BUY ME AWAY.

1183
01:25:22,217 --> 01:25:24,084
Father: THIS IS
ALL MY FAULT, YOU KNOW.

1184
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:27,287
  I SWEAR, IT IS MY MISTAKE.

1185
01:25:27,322 --> 01:25:30,591
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER SENT THE BOY
TO SCHOOL IN LONDON.

1186
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,826
        OBSERVE, MOLL.

1187
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:35,629
     GREAT MONEY DOES NOT
      A GREAT HUMAN MAKE.

1188
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:39,633
  MY SON TELLS ME
  THAT I HAVE NEVER
  DEMONSTRATED LOVE FOR HIM.

1189
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:42,803
    WELL, LET ME SEE
    HOW I CAN DO THAT.

1190
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:46,240
    WELL, I CAN AT LEAST
    PROTECT HIM.

1191
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:48,509
    IF YOU MARRY HER,

1192
01:25:48,543 --> 01:25:51,311
     I SHALL NOT ONLY
     DISINHERIT YOU,

1193
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:53,647
 I SHALL EXCOMMUNICATE YOU.

1194
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:56,350
AS GOD IS MY JUDGE.
                  ENOUGH!!!

1195
01:25:58,353 --> 01:26:02,689
      YOU KEEP SENDING MY SISTER
      TO LONDON WITH MONEY
      TO SEDUCE ME,

1196
01:26:02,724 --> 01:26:05,859
              BUT YOU NEVER ONCE
              CAME YOURSELF!

1197
01:26:07,428 --> 01:26:10,364
          OH, I DIDN'T ALWAYS
          TAKE THE MONEY.

1198
01:26:10,398 --> 01:26:12,966
        AND SOMETIMES
        I THOUGHT I MIGHT FOLD

1199
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:16,837
          AND RUN BACK LIKE
          SOME SCARED RABBIT.

1200
01:26:16,871 --> 01:26:19,573
                 BUT I HAVEN'T.

1201
01:26:19,607 --> 01:26:22,809
      AND I NEVER WILL..

1202
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:26,213
AS LONG AS MOLL IS AT MY SIDE.

1203
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:39,326
     IF PAIN....

1204
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,729
  IS THE PROOF
