{18724}{18803}James Mertin, an I rish ship captain,|came to this town...

{19652}{19735}Captain Mertin, I'm afraid hat|the world was not built with me in mind.
{19738}{19825}Doorknobs are too high,|chairs are unwieldy...
{19826}{19878}and high-ceilinged rooms|mock my stature.

{131025}{131133}- [ Panting ]|- There, there, my dear. Relax.
{131135}{131217}This travesty will|all be over with by morning.
{131219}{131285}And the crowds have been|absolutely sensational...
{131287}{131369}and, um, I'd just like to thank God|for giving us this opportunity...
{131371}{131417}to share our creative vision.
{131419}{131505}[Narrator]Nothing was impossible|for John and Maxine in the early days.
{131507}{131593}Their union was a joyous one,|and together they worked tirelessly...
{131595}{131654}to further Malkovich's|puppeteering career.
{131655}{131709}John Malkovich, the artist...
{131711}{131770}and Maxine, the entrepreneur--
{131773}{131822}they make this character...
{131825}{131909}this protean figure|that we cal John Malkovich.
{131911}{132003}[Narrator]But some say Maxine|has changed since becoming pregnant...
{132005}{132061}recoiling from the limelight...
{132063}{132130}and, rumor has it,|from her husband's affections.
{132347}{132411}[ Whispering ]|I'm so sorry.
{132531}{132602}[Bing]Malkovich shows us...
{132603}{132693}a reflection of ourselves,|our frailties...
{132695}{132826}and our, you know,|desperate humanity.
{132828}{132942}That's what makes him one of|the most relevant artists of our time.
{132944}{133033}[Narrator]And what does the future|hold for John Horatio Malkovich?
{133035}{133145}Well, to quote the Bard,|"He's got the world on a string. "
{133147}{133267}As the poet said, "The puppeteer's voice|need not merely be the record of man.
{133269}{133329}It can be one of the pillars,|the props...
{133331}{133414}to help him endure and prevail,"|and I believe that.
{133441}{133487}It's over!
{133533}{133581}Max?
{133582}{133649}I've gotta head down to A.B.T. now.
{133651}{133729}I've got the "Swan Lake"|benefit tonight, okay?
{133731}{133795}But when I come back,|we can maybe celebrate...
