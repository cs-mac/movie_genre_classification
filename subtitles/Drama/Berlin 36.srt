Hurry up, Emma.

Ms. Bergmann is on its way to Germany.

00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,995

He won the British championship.

Drinks on me!
No, given the house to pay them.

35
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,869
They do not pay me
anyway enough.

36
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,758
Father!

37
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,232
How are you here?

38
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,194
Were you the stadium?
-Of course.

39
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,356
Congratulations, my dear.

40
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,397
Would you drink?
-No, thank you.

41
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,676
How can a mother?
-Well.

42
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,637
Very well.
-What about Walter?

43
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,558
He also.

44
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,278
Wait and see.

45
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,238
Rudolph took a picture of us.

46
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,277
ltselaukaisulla. It is for you.

47
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,269
Thank you. What has happened to your hand?

48
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,792
It was crushed.

49
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,629
Would you come out with me for a moment?

50
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,556
What's the matter? -Some people would like,
that you will return to Germany.

51
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,439
You will need to participate in
olympialaisvalmisteluihin.

52
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,676
I need to do what?

53
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,637
U.S. threatens to boycott the games.

54
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,878
I will not return.
-Hitler's racial politics.

55
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,718
I do not go back there!

56
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,393
Father, they have not given my
even to practice. -It's true -

57
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,030
but you are now the British champion.
Everything is different now.

58
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,916
Now this was your idea.
-I know.

59
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,750
You told me when I'm in London,
does not have to worry about.

60
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,236
Now we have to fear,
if you do not return.

61
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,557
Nothing is too much for them.

62
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,637
Not even the spirit of exploitation.

63
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,195
There is talk about this more tomorrow.
Good night, sweetheart. -Good night.

64
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,918
I ...

65
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,350
Hi ...

66
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,713
It's all right.

67
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,508
Welcome, Mr. Brundage.
-Thank you.

68
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,352
Mrs. Vogel.

69
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,633
Ritter von Halti know you.
-Karl.

70
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,435
Thank you for your warm welcome.

71
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,477
Mr. Brundage,
Ask questions.

72
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,598
Can Jews be
German sports association?

73
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,829
Do not. -Not at all my
Association in Chicago ...

74
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,597
If a Jewish athlete runs
100 meters in 10.3 seconds -

75
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,679
whether they participate in the Olympic Games?

76
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,597
How nice if he can not
to practice? -Of course you can.

77
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,398
As you may know, we invited
juutalaisurheilijat test matches.

78
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,469
A farce!

79
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,354
Every one of them
can cope with races.

80
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,710
So they get to participate?

81
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,592
Of course.

82
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,435
Of course.

83
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,436
All right.

84
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,158
Hi, Mom.
-Darling.

85
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,636
Do you recognize me yet?
I am your brother, it is a genius.

86
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,672
Thank you, genius.

87
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,519
At least you could enjoy a little bit more.

88
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,393
Where is Walter?
-Oh yeah, you know not.

89
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,634
He is in the hospital.
It seems bad.

90
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,438
Hello, Walter.

91
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,475
Still have not grown up?
-Look at this.

92
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,677
Now I have them all.

93
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,554
Your daughter is right now a celebrity.

94
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,558
Oletjo 1 7-years old. Are not
not yet started your period?.

95
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,590
When were you last a doctor?
-I do not know.

96
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,837
It is estimated that?

97
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,394
I've never been sick.

98
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,956
Remove vaatteesija stand over there.

99
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,156
There are some good aspects of this, Gretel.

100
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,550
What could I do?
I would like to hear it.

101
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,951
Would we have been forfeited?
-After all, I came.

102
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,310
He's right.

103
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,829
Why did he bites one's food?

104
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,990
Without food I am weak and I can not
jump, the Nazis and do not choose me.

105
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,317
What a charming logic.

106
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,314
They can force me to return to,
but not the beat -

107
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,192
their father's land.

108
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,790
This is yours isanmaasi.
Do not miss it.

109
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,191
No more.

110
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,674
Your father fought in the war for this country
on behalf of, and almost lost his life.

111
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,711
Where are you, Emma?

112
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,635
You need to feed the chickens.

113
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,074
Where is he?
-Who?

114
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,391
What are you doing?.

115
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,354
What have I said?.

116
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,551
What have I said?.

117
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,116
Is this a suitable book for girls?

118
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,871
Is this a suitable book for girls?
I sanonutjo a thousand times!

119
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,916
This house is like a madhouse!

120
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,277
Gretel?

121
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,273
We were guests: Mr. Lowenstein
Jewish sports association.

122
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,159
I do not want to take your time in a long time.
May I?

123
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,432
I can imagine
how does this affect you.

124
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,429
First, you run the country
and then claimed back.

125
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,597
They can not dictate,
how high I jump.

126
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,508
He's going to embarrass the Nazis.
-I do not let them use me.

127
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,232
Do not you?

128
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,148
I think Gretel is right.

129
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,435
This field should not be disclosed to them
without a fight.

130
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,917
Probably because
you it should not be considered here.

131
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,679
Imagine that you win a medal.

132
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,590
The whole nonsense of the Aryan race
superiority of any meaning.

133
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,391
If you want to really embarrass the Nazis,
you will have to overcome them.

134
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,791
That's what I said.

135
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,433
You are the great hope of many, Gretel.

136
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,919
Perhaps you are considering this yet.

137
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,711
We can not in any way Berg's over.

138
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,156
All are waiting for the U.S.,
that he will participate in the preparation of -

139
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,559
and I say directly:
U.S. participation will depend on.

140
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,390
He participates in
In any event exercises.

141
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,511
Cognac?
-I'd love to.

142
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,630
Excuse me.
Two-brandy.

143
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,030
Well?

144
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,233
We might have
Gold medal candidate.

145
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,238
What do you mean "might"?

146
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,753
The matter is somewhat delicate.
Here is a doctor's statement.

147
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,075
Does somebody
In addition to doctors about this?

148
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,950
What is it?

149
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,958
If Lowenstein is right, they do not
can not let me in Berlin.

150
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,392
I believe that they do not have
other choice.

151
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,154
What if anything happens to me?

152
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,111
What could happen to you?

153
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,196
Keep in mind that the Americans
are on our side.

154
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,599
I wonder if my daughter
yet sometimes a smile for me?

155
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,792
Keep your head up.

156
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,918
Marie!

157
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,356
Marie, come here!

158
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,509
Gretel Bergmann.

159
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,716
Waldmann, Hans.

160
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,752
National coach.
-It was he.

161
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,870
Days.
-Days.

162
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,754
Come. I'll show room.

163
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,355
You do not appear to korkeushyppaajalta.

164
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,916
I've never seemed
But despite -

165
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,349
sivusin German records.

166
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,797
How long has it been?

167
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,719
Your tongue is sharp, at least.

168
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,357
Come on.

169
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,235
This is your room.

170
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,390
Who is sleeping in another bed?

171
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,756
No one.

172
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,073
So you can bring
your boyfriend here.

173
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,875
Is that allowed?

174
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,269
lltaruoka served at 19

175
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,677
Marie Ketteler?

176
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,872
Come.

177
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,390
You know who I am?
-I know.

178
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,717
lstuutukaa.

179
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,071
You kohdallanne
many things have gone wrong.

180
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,953
Normally I would get
sends you into a mental hospital.

181
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,392
I would not want
that this will need to go to it.

182
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,152
If it happens to you, I offer my help.

183
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,393
You would like the captain of the ship.
-So.

184
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,469
I can see to it
that you will get a decent education.

185
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,913
You would have to be
to do something about it.

186
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,318
What?

187
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,878
To serve your native country.

188
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,149
The task is not easy,
But you can do it.

189
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,795
Have you already esittaytyneet?.

190
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,073
Gretel, here are Lilly and Thea.

191
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,951
lstuutukaa.

192
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,949
A vain hope. The boys leave tomorrow.
-Too bad.

193
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,035
You've probably heard Gretel
success in England?

194
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,991
Let me make this clear:

195
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,353
elsewhere, you can rip each other's eyes
to get, but here you behave.

196
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,429
You can read the Bible or the Talmud.

197
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,192
Here, only the mean
suorituksetja success. Is that clear?

198
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,598
Well done.

199
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,396
Let's see what kind of endurance
is. Light warm-up run.

200
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,309
Posture, Lilly.

201
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,558
You need to keep your body
as long as possible straight.

202
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,356
A little more boldly.

203
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,678
Add to the dynamics of speed deployment.

204
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,513
Come on.
It remained at the optimum posture.

205
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,076
Completely error-free.
Perfect, Gretel.

206
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,631
Well done. This was not the first bad;
But remember -

207
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,675
leave your burdens to the ground. Every
jumping is like a flight to heaven.

208
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,794
You will become lighter than the birds.

209
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,039
Then there is jaahdyttelyjuoksu.
Go ahead.

210
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,353
155 centimeters?

211
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,078
How many times have you jumped in?
-Three times.

212
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,077
Three times?

213
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,115
A medical report is missing.

214
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,435
Why do you have my saippuani?

215
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,028
What do you need?
-It belongs to me.

216
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,630
So. It is Thean soap.

217
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,791
You know what?

218
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,038
Gave it to you.

219
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,797
Who are you?

220
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,632
Marie.

221
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,799
Did not you see,
bunk that is already taken?

222
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,514
I can not sleep at the top.

223
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,515
I am the way Gretel.

224
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,670
You do not have a particularly talkative.

225
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,991
What do you write?

226
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,797
In my diary.
-Interesting.

227
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,511
And who is H. W.?

228
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,757
Hans Waldmann.

229
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,791
What is it called?

230
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,915
"H. W. argues sivunneensa
German records in the past.

231
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,838
I asked, almost,
what type of sport. "

232
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,718
I'm glad you asked. Mr. Waldmann
is reportedly angry long.

233
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,795
The new roommate has jumped
This year, 155 centimeters.

234
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,992
Is that right?
I would not have believed it of him.

235
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,708
That is why I told you about it.

236
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,077
You now have four.
Only three can go to Berlin.

237
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,230
Out of bed.

238
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,710
He will do everything.
-Do not you then?

239
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,754
What is this?
Feet in front of another, come on!

240
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,033
Not to stay kuhnailemaan!

241
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,034
Not bad,
But that is not the height of the jump.

242
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,357
Technique, ladies!
Who's next?

243
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,358
Gretel.

244
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,032
Perfect, Gretel.

245
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,599
Would somebody is going to the ticket?

246
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,551
Well, do not ujostelko.

247
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,992
Excellent.

248
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,791
What about you, Thea?

249
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,838
Almost.

250
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,238
You're welcome.

251
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,071
Sport, seeking information about
women's abilities on a regular basis.

252
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,955
Of course.

253
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,670
How Marie Ketteler doing?
-Very well.

254
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,550
I have not seen a doctor for an opinion,
even though I asked for ...

255
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,151
Sport should be happy,
if Ketteler to reach Berlin.

256
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,631
I wonder what he thinks?
I coach a girl -

257
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,151
but he has to jump alone.
Or nostanko him enough self-confidence?

258
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,113
It is up to you how to do it.

259
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,438
Do not underestimate
her potential.

260
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,552
<i> Heil Hitler!</i>

261
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,155
"Perfect, Gretel."

262
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,360
Did you bring this time with its own saippuasi?
-I brought. It looks the same as yours.

263
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,032
You need to improve vauhdinottoasi.
You will be too much in front.

264
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,280
If you want, I can show you.

265
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:12,712
If you want, I can show you.

266
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,358
It does not matter, provided that the strip
remains at the top. -If you say so.

267
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,678
Do you think that I do not know,
that you are Jewish?

268
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:28,069
What does that mean?
We left, certainly the first.

269
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,118
"Fast as the greyhound,
tough as leather -

270
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,836
and hard as Krupp steel. "How
old are you? To 17-year-old. What do you mean?

271
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,559
Production of a disappointment to you.
I am not sure the source first.

272
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,191
What is it? What are you waiting for?.

273
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,711
Why do you call that?

274
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,833
Speak the manner in
which you try to exceed the bar.

275
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,238
Have you ever heard of saksauksesta?

276
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,752
Could you perhaps
show it off to us?

277
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,877
Or at least try?

278
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,276
What was that?
-I do not know.

279
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,109
The first Saksauksessa
the other foot, and then another!

280
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,800
Give her time now!

281
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,357
I beg your pardon?
-The technology is new to him.

282
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,796
Would you like to perhaps
results in practice?

283
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,392
What does that really was?

284
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,036
Take care of your own business.

285
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,998
I'm sorry.

286
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,756
Why do you tackle even the affairs of others?
-Why do not you have the other room?

287
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,271
I asked already.
-And?

288
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,958
Do not have any free.

289
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,594
Marie, we need to talk.

290
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,548
Then I travel to Berlin
magnificent white uniforms -

291
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,830
and I win the gold -

292
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,834
Fuhrer and then shaking hands with me.

293
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,071
Decathlete come!

294
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,351
Come on!

295
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,078
Days.

296
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,715
Hey.

297
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,635
Did you select the one already?

298
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,916
Very beautiful.

299
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,314
Is that him?
-Who?

300
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,029
He looks different in the picture.

301
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,072
That's true.

302
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,794
Somehow the better, is not it?
-So.

303
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,391
Are you here?

304
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,151
What do you want?
-It is he.

305
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,479
Can I get your signature?
It will kerailyalbumiini.

306
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,110
That's funny. -What is he?
I asked politely.

307
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,354
Great Britain's champion!

308
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:05,150
Is it a success, perhaps risen to the head?
Or do you like yourself better than others?

309
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,274
Be careful that it does not only end badly.

310
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,555
Do not want to raise them?

311
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,591
I interrupting something?

312
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,351
Who did this?

313
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,433
I want to know who did this!

314
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,598
I see. Women like one.

315
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,273
Well ... It's actually a good thing.

316
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,839
Too bad only the images with respect.

317
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,671
Enter them here.

318
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,636
Thea?

319
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,955
I wish I could see so much effort
in front of your training.

320
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,637
Thea is a stupid bitch.

321
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,713
<i> Heil Hitler! </i>
<i> Heil Hitler! </i>

322
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,839
The Fuhrer asked me to convey to you
best wishes.

323
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,716
He puts hope in you, so
Please do not disappoint him.

324
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,875
If you could
to give up for a while ... trainers?

325
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,158
Hurry up then! You know what to do.

326
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,792
Ladies and Gentlemen.

327
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,753
We read the report.
Do you want to add something?

328
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,479
I think we can be
very pleased with the results.

329
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:09,556
I will be brief. It seems,
that you are not suitable for this position.

330
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,558
Fingertip feel when this is needed,
which you clearly is not.

331
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,798
If you are asking for,
I prefer that one of the girls ...

332
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,758
This is a sport, not politics!
-No.

333
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,631
This is a
merge them into one another.

334
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,117
That's why our roads that fork now.

335
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:38,108
I ask you to clear this
sty immediately. 
<i> Heil Hitler </i>.

336
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,671
What actually happened over there?

337
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,916
Just like you do not know.

338
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,231
You were always his favorite.
"Perfect, Gretel. Good, Gretel."

339
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:41,358
You are unusually stupid detractor.
-I would be more prudent to assume your identity.

340
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,633
Is that your boyfriend?
-No, but my brother Rudolph.

341
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,838
You do not look alike.
-He comes from my mother. Look.

342
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,991
Will you get along well?

343
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,874
We will, and fighting repeatedly.

344
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,436
What about your parents?

345
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,472
My father is often traveling for work purposes.
He has a hiuslisaketehdas.

346
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,108
Your mother looks nice.

347
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,308
He is like all mothers.
He complains about all the time.

348
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:51,470
He brought the noise to London departing
due. When the father told him about it -

349
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,878
He locked themselves in their room
for two days in protest.

350
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,354
Then he blamed my father
week on how this release -

351
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,040
his daughter alone to London.

352
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,756
What is your mother doing?

353
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,396
I aitiniko?

354
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,073
Create manure in the barn. To milk the cows.

355
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,034
Hit their children.

356
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,599
What about your father?
-My mother drove him away from the farm.

357
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,110
Have you read this many times already?
-I am, very many.

358
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,234
Do you want it?

359
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,711
Thank you.

360
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,791
Mr. Waldmann left yesterday
due to a sudden family matter.

361
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,155
Derivative I now practice.
I Sigfrid Kulmbach.

362
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,113
Say as soon as
that things are changing here.

363
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,797
It is your own good.
There is talk of more in the field.

364
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,515
Enjoy your meal.

365
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,479
It's nice to see you, Ms. Bergmann.
Enjoy your meal.

366
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,631
Do you know him?.

367
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,518
You get to run more,
especially Gretel -

368
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,474
whose condition is room for improvement,
but we're working on it.

369
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,319
Gretel, five laps the field
round. Others come with me.

370
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,356
Now you can rest.

371
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,431
What about after that?
-Yet another five rounds.

372
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,036
Marie, Lilly, Thea.
Well done. Heal at all times.

373
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,710
How are you?
-Well.

374
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:39,597
Well done.
Marie, go sit in the other creates.

375
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,472
Do you work at all,
what the coach tells you?

376
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,712
I do not know. I ...

377
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,470
How long are you?

378
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,999
"Nobody could have predicted his heart
the amount of bitterness.

379
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,949
It was the perfect protective curtain
a deadly mission. "

380
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,310
What exactly is it done?

381
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,878
Captain Gundolf is a spy,
which attracts enemies into a trap -

382
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,309
and then ...
-Will he?

383
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,791
Do not want to read to the end?

384
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,838
I want to.

385
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,792
Gretel?

386
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,035
Would you show it to me yet?

387
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,593
What?
-The way in which the German.

388
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,557
Maybe.

389
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,518
So.

390
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,957
Curve of this back over the bar,
and ponnista ...

391
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,151
Is not transmitted to them.

392
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,672
A little further away.
That's it. Then ...

393
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,519
What are you doing?
-Is not it obvious?

394
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,117
I do not remember requesting your help.
Training will start after breakfast.

395
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,835
I have not jumped in your times
at all times. -In time.

396
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:28,317
Why do not you immediately dashed
my feet? -Continue in my office.

397
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,036
Close the door. Thank you.

398
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,430
I thought you realize this.

399
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,911
Access to Berlin
depends on their performance.

400
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,630
Why do not you let me jump in?
Of course, you jump.

401
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,997
It is your kohdallanne
Timing is important.

402
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,193
I have no you,
but I admire your gifts.

403
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,959
Let us not fool ourselves. Aryan
girls like to show rajanne.

404
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:08,030
I prepare you for it, if only
injury due.

405
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:13,389
You look exhausted.
Perhaps you would like to rest a couple of days.

406
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,715
It is not necessary.

407
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,714
You are an intelligent young woman.

408
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,754
I'm getting you certainly see things
my way.

409
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,078
What happened?

410
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,196
He wants you to give up.

411
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,517
"Perhaps you would like to rest
a couple of days, "he said.

412
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,191
The right pig!

413
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,592
Why should you donate blood?
You are the best.

414
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,670
Marie, a ten-fighters called the
us to join him.

415
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,395
One of them has a birthday.
What's the matter? -Nothing.

416
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,795
Today in the evening, at eight o'clock.

417
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,515
Am I really think is the best?

418
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,233
Well, maybe only second best.

419
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,552
Will you come with me?

420
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,754
I'll go only if you're going.

421
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,152
You look great.
-So are you.

422
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,517
Wait and see.

423
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,353
Sons of fingers do not
out of you.

424
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,677
lltaa.

425
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,393
Would you like to dance?
-Do not you know who I am?

426
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,269
Ask them if they say yes.

427
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,637
What is it?

428
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,277
Ernst, the decathlete.

429
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,919
Do you know what, he asked?

430
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,070
That I can help him improve
his high jump technique.

431
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,718
Have you had
never a boyfriend?

432
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,875
Is it even once?

433
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,838
What about you?

434
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,355
After all, they had a few.

435
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,470
What about now?

436
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,592
Now I only have my coach.

437
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,469
Good night, Marie.
-Good night.

438
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,670
Thank you.

439
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,517
Did you read the report already Kulmbachin?
-Of course.

440
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:07,316
What's in it Berg Mann? His
adequate performance in Berlin.

441
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,957
Do not worry about it.
We have full confidence in Kulmbach.

442
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,478
How can you be so sure?
-I know him.

443
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,429
He uses unusual,
but effective ways.

444
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,752
He does not have much time left.
I hope he understands it.

445
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,230
Then there are the Marie
and Ms. Bergmann.

446
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,118
All right. This is enough.
-What do you mean?

447
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,479
Are you afraid of the world record?
-Save it for later.

448
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,797
Hi, Open up!

449
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,392
Hello!

450
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,791
You can take this.

451
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,993
There is a gap in the laundry. I'm going to apply for
help. -You do not do anything.

452
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,756
Ow!

453
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,955

453
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,955
Where do you come from?

454
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,278
Yes?

455
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,399
Can I come in?
-You.

456
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,950
I wanted to tell you about it.

457
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,912
They forced me to ...
-Leave me alone.

458
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,957
Get out of here.

459
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,678
What happened?

460
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,238
Nothing.
Riitelitteko-?

461
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,674
We do not. Someone locked us into the shower.

462
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:50,071
Did you notice ... Marie How
its now saying ... Something weird?

463
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,517
I do not.

464
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,675
I hope your foot
did not make it worse.

465
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,352
We need to talk.

466
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,910
Who else knows?
-None.

467
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,557
I was examined by a doctor.
-Who else?

468
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,349
Tschammer und Osten. You represent a good-
friends, but you're one of them!

469
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,038
I do not.

470
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:54,869
Is this too organized thing?
This here, now? -No!

471
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,710
You realize everything wrong.

472
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,314
You need to replace me.
-No!

473
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:04,911
Why do they put the boy girl
clothes? -They do not put.

474
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,079
I have always used the
girls' clothes.

475
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,077
I do not understand.

476
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,233
My mother insisted on
to get the girl.

477
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,797
I had a sister,
who died a half year old.

478
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:24,676
How can anyone not noticed that you do not
not a girl? -She gave birth to me alone.

479
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,999
The coach wants to talk to you.
-Why?

480
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,392
He did not say.

481
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:36,038
All right. <i> Heil Hitler! </i> Check!

482
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,629

You surely do not want to sit down.

483
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:55,157
Sometimes people think
strange things.

484
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,876
Especially if they happen to be
shock state.

485
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,991
In which state of shock?

486
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,560
If I get to hear rumors of -

487
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:10,118
sick rumor, which may
damage to the German sports ...

488
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,800
I assume that you do not know what I'm talking.

489
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,477
We do not.

490
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,718
So far so good.

491
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,629
Indeed, we would destroy
those rumors immediately.

492
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,478
One more thing. I was 10 minutes
Then a call from Berlin.

493
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,236
Based on their performance -

494
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:33,398
you have survived the races.

495
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,273
However, you are missing
competition experience.

496
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,391
He is a British champion.

497
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:42,071
That is why we decided to
with the Ministry of Sport -

498
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,830
send him
Wurttemberg championships.

499
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:51,071
When? -The day after tomorrow.
Or is producing problems with your feet?

500
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,231
No.

501
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,038
Much of your day.

502
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,949
Why did not you tell?
-Are you crazy?.

503
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:05,950
What do you think you have them do to me,
if they hear that I know?

504
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:10,628
Be glad then, that the
I was silent. -Not funny.

505
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,752
I'm serious.
We get this done in only one.

506
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,875
"We"?

507
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,912
Actually, it's a compliment.

508
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,238
What?

509
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:07,029
That they laittavat man to compete with
against me.

510
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,311
So.

511
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,990
It was a joke.

512
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,599
I realized, yes.
-Is that so?

513
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:24,439
Do you have the cream yet?
-It is, in the room.

514
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,551
You can sleep alasangylla, if you want.
-Thank you.

515
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,990
Is it any better?

516
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,874
What does not kill you, it strengthens.

517
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:00,348
They agreed that if a win gold,
I get to live as a man.

518
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,076
Think you can do it?

519
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,953
I'm supposed to give you wins.

520
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,795
Would you do that?

521
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,276
I do not.

Which revealed the he in the end?

Ms. Bergmann.
-Heinz!

Do you remember? We went to the same school.

529
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,236
Come. The competition has already begun.

530
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,278
Make haste.

531
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:22,039
How many people are still with me?
-None.

532
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:26,313
Yeah, but ... -You have the list.
Everything is agreed.

-Now.

Bergmann took first place.
He was just overwhelming.

545
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:33,636
He almost broke the

-10 In the morning.

a young man. -My God!

Perhaps the ship through the radio. It should
first to agree. -What are you waiting for?

01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:55,274
American Supplier wanted
interview. Sinultako-?

636
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:58,950
So. Who else?
-You do not speak English.

637
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:20,148
Mr. Jackson?

638
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,876
Ms. Bergmann?
-Yes?

639
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,555
A man is waiting for you downstairs.

640
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,198
Hello?

641
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,157
Underestimated you.

642
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:29,956
I was sure,
that failed you in Stuttgart.

643
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,870
What do you want?

644
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:37,078
A number of gentlemen
are not happy with me.

645
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:41,193
I assured them that
that I can get you to back off.

646
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,830
What do you retreat?

647
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,675
You did not want more cases?

648
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,310
A well-known Jewish
sports official was lost.

649
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:56,194
Amerikkalaistoimittaja had
a traffic accident.

650
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:00,233
This may happen around you:
your parents, your brothers -

651
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:03,272
Marielle ...
-Why is Marie?

652
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,671
Or maybe not. It depends on you.

653
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,117
It depends on the
what say you to the world.

654
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,989
Of course, this does not pass
so far. You see?

655
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:18,109
You do not talk to anyone, and do not in any
jumps in the name, which annoys me.

656
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:25,513
You can also choose the death of a hero.
However, we do not see each other anymore.

657
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:28,990
I wish you all the best.

658
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:50,077
What did he want?
So, give up.

659
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:54,395
What about an American journalist?
-Road.

660
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,476
Come.

661
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,150
What are you going to do now?

662
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,751
Nothing.

663
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:24,799
You can not just give up.
-Do you have a better proposal?

664
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:35,512
What if loukkaantuisin
in practice?

665
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:38,632
What does it benefit?

666
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,515
They voittivatjo.

667
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,351
Maybe not even then.

668
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:33,398
Coming up is
women's high jump final -

669
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:37,308
which are increasingly involved in the German
Lilly Vogtja Marie Ketteler.

670
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:42,311
Both have the opportunity to medal,
especially 17-year-old Mariella -

671
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:46,433
which is treated as drills
based on a favorite.

672
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:21,999
<i> good jump. Lilly Vogt above </i>
<i> the first 154 cm of </i>.

673
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:24,998
S <i> EXT is Marie Ketteler </i>.

674
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,755
Another German crossed the bar,
and the medal hopes of voivatjatkua.

675
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:05,916
<i> Mitalitjaetaan </i>
<i> these four young women between the </i>.

676
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:11,239
S <i> Aksa will certainly get one medal, </i>
<i> but what? </i>

677
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:19,552
Please silence Marie Ketteler
The last jump.

678
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:33,436
Tense your body until you have exceeded the
the bar. 160 is not a problem.

679
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:27,676
<i> martial medal was solved </i>.
<i> Marie Ketteler will place four </i>.

680
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:07,911
It is not only the Jews
were forced to concentration camps.

681
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:11,874
If he would have said something,
He ended up in there as soon as -

682
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,754
as it is claimed to be
a great lie.

683
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:20,112
It certainly was for him
bad time.

684
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:26,790
Perhaps the situation would have been different if the
he would have acted on a voluntary basis -

685
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:31,715
but he was forced to this, so
than me, too specific to your situation.

686
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:35,833
I was really sorry for him.
I wrote to him again -

687
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:38,155
but I never received an answer.

688
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:49,317
Marie Ketteler was forced to stay
The German women's national team -

689
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:52,591
and to participate in the
international competitions.

690
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:55,518
In 1938, he became
European champion -

691
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:58,791
a new world record
170 centimeters.

692
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:01,798
On the way home the tournament
He fanned the Gestapo -

693
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:05,390
beard, and to drive intoxicated,
and he was arrested.

694
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,675
In 1939, hanetjulistettiin
in a closed hearing -

695
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,155
Verden District Court of a man.

696
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:17,709
He survived the war and died in
complete isolation in 2008.

697
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:23,198
The number of times a dream -

698
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:29,071
I was in Berlin
preparing for the height of the jump.

699
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:36,837
It felt as if I had followed the
100 000 pairs of eyes -

700
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:43,315
and then kuulutettiin;
the high jump will start -

701
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:48,275
and I tried to walk, and could not.
I could not move the meat at all.

702
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:55,352
I was scared so much,
raajani that weighed as stones.

703
01:32:55,760 --> 01:33:02,472
It was a recurring nightmare. "What do they
make me, if I win? "

704
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:07,275
Gretel Bergmann
moved to the U.S. in 1937 -

705
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:10,915
and won the U.S. Championship
the years 1937 and 1938.

706
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,998
Her fiance Bruno
was followed in 1938 -

707
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:16,714
and they were married
in September 1938.

708
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:20,958
The family managed to escape from the Gretel
ajoissaja survived the Holocaust.

709
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,430
Bruno and Gretel Bergmann-Lambert -

710
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:26,358
