Film studio "Thor"
presents the film.

FAMILY LIFE

4
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,916
Stop worrying and turning around.

5
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,038
We only for a minute.

6
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,791
What are you looking out for, young ladies?

7
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,036
"Is this your Octavia?"
- Yes.

8
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,196
You have an honorable escort.

9
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,792
Jacek, let's play.

10
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,913
All right, 13.

11
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,990
Pan Brown, figure, please.

12
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,751
- What for?
- This is a sportlot.

13
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,992
If it's a sport, then the number.

14
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,999
What's the difference.

15
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,752
Pani Bassia...

16
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,553
6.

17
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,518
Pan Marek, the figure.

18
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,713
17.

19
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,679
Thank you.

20
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,359
Marek, you noticed that people very
rarely cross out the unit and 49.

21
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,479
Well...

22
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,835
They see a target in the coupon,
they choose in the middle,

23
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,198
and the probability of hitting
the corners is the same.

24
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,279
Naturally, you are absolutely right.
And how much did I bet?

25
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,793
- 17.
- So what?

26
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,515
And I'm 6.

27
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,799
And you?

28
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,160
No, I have principles, and,
besides, I do not have a trifle.

29
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,519
I'll take care of you.

30
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,199
After all, still lose.

31
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,191
You will be embarrassed
when we win.

32
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,118
On the contrary.

33
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,029
Here is our design office.

34
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,718
I beg.

35
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,919
I beg.

36
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,551
Pan is the manager, tell us...

37
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,634
No, it's details, maybe next...

38
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,599
I ask here.

39
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,599
In general, we manufacture
mechanisms for transport equipment.

40
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,238
Please, please.

41
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,794
And here we have just our new technical
solutions for the so-called boat.

42
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,152
Here they develop
original solutions...

43
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,597
bolts for boats...

44
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,799
I'm sorry, what?

45
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,030
You know, I do not know
much about technical terms.

46
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,239
These are not bolts, they are clamps.

47
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,708
They are used on ships.

48
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,159
- A, clear.
- Thank you.

49
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,116
- Many thanks.
- You are welcome.

50
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,753
I beg.

51
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,560
After all, I said the right thing, right?

52
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,355
Yes.

53
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,952
You'll go to India, you'll see.

54
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,553
Well, of course.

55
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,917
Do you want a pear tree? I have two.

56
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,591
"Did they send you from home?"
Yeah.

57
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,439
What are you doing on Sunday?

58
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
Who!

59
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:35,476
Well, are you with Christina?

60
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,951
Why are you marrying us like this?

61
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,479
So what do you do?

62
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,754
I do not know.

63
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,638
Christina, truly, will be engaged.

64
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,918
Maybe go to the Vistula?

65
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,919
And you will go?

66
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,592
Well, I'm thinking about it.

67
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,554
I'm listening, CB.

68
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,188
Now.

69
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,996
You are asked to the secretariat.

70
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,838
"They did not say why?"
- No.

71
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,390
I told you.
It is already being sent.

72
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,834
Excuse me, please,
but you called me.

73
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,674
Yes, a moment.

74
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,993
I accepted the telephone message.
Here you are.

75
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,071

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,239
Have you answered them by telegram?

86
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,959
No, we will come faster than
they will receive an answer.

87
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,076
Listen, how old is your old man?

88
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,959
Over sixty.

89
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,155
Well, it's not age yet.

90
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,714
Well, you know, if you have
not been ill all your life...

91
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,839
now to the right.

92
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,080
"What are they releasing here?"
Glass.

93
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,878
Before the war, they made
crystal and laboratory glass.

94
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,117
Now I'll bring you water.

95
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,599
Listen, you get your bearings,

96
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,876
maybe you need to go to the pharmacy
or the doctor, I'm in no hurry.

97
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,158
Is anyone at home?

98
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,355
- I arrived?
- Yes.

99
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,280
So what? Will not you say hello?

100
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,479
Good afternoon.

101
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,752
Rather, good evening.

102
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,352
Previously, he could not come.

103
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,438
I just said so, just
a good evening.

104
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,236
I thought that if you come at all,
it's more likely tomorrow morning.

105
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,558
And why "if"?

106
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,112
You still ask?

107
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,991
We will not quarrel, what with the father?

108
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,754
Sleeping.

109
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,031
I ask, what's wrong with him?

110
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,959
I do not know. A bit of everything.

111
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,110
- Specifically.
- I do not know.

112
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,628
I told you that
nothing is known.

113
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,709
Well, well, what are the symptoms?

114
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,755
Talk to him, you'll see.

115
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,312
"Is he at home?"
- Yes.

116
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,793
Good dog, good, well, everything...

117
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,870
Caligari, come here...

118
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,919
He does not bite. Only flea.

119
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,799
The dog is not to blame,
you know, that flea.

120
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,476
In the end, there are so
many people hanging out.

121
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,678
Well, Caligari.

122
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,759
But this is not a reason
to look at me indecently.

123
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,999
Oh shit.

124
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,238
Did not work out.

125
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,036
I wanted to embarrass you.

126
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,876
"Did you bring the goods?"
No. I brought Vita.

127
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,313
Very nice.

128
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,916
I am his sister, Isabella.

129
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,876
No, it's dirty.

130
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,870
I just broke it.

131
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,199
Thank you.

132
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,433
Caligari!

133
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,753
A dog with a bad
heredity, Caligari!

134
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,473
There is no water?

135
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,439
Nope. Water for two
years as spoiled.

136
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,635
- It was impossible to repair it?
- Of course you can.

137
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,319
And what? Someone in a faint,
why do you need so much water?

138
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,959
Wit!

139
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,679
Hey. How are you?

140
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,999
Good afternoon.

141
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,353
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

142
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,516
The prodigal brother returned.

143
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,556
Stop pretending to be crazy.

144
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,912
Pretend?
I can pretend to be normal...,

145
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,719
but I do not want.

146
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,158
Is it enough?

147
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,110
Why do not you invite a
guest into the house?

148
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,839
No, thank you, I need to go.

149
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,399
I'm going to Warsaw, and in the
morning I have to be in Chorzow.

150
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,079
- In Chorzow?
- Yes.

151
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,718
- What for?
- Job.

152
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,031
God, how people work.

153
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,990
You'll stay for tea.

154
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,796
Aunt, we have a guest for dinner.

155
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,435
"What about the father?"
"God knows."

156
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,557
Please, from the front door.

157
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,550
Well, let's go! Come on.

158
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,589
Wit!

159
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,399
This is my friend, fellow student.

160
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,674
Sobota.

161
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,113
- And this is our aunt.
- Please, please.

162
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,155
Why do you pretend that
you do not look around?

163
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,953
This is normal.

164
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,591
Wit did not tell you
about our family nest?

165
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,239
You're friends.

166
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,636
But now it's running...

167
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,834
And this is our mother.
Aunt's own sister.

168
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,239
Are not they alike?

169
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,076
Our mother is so beautiful, only her
dad does not distinguish between them.

170
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,636
Especially in the dark.

171
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,270
Could, at last, collect
their belongings.

172
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,232
You see that I can not.

173
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,432
Was there an accident?

174
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,079
I saw my father's bandaged too.

175
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,718
- Accident?
- Yes.

176
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,793
It is not enough. It was a disaster.

177
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,358
Why is not he in the hospital?

178
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,719
Why is not he in the hospital!?

179
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,358
Ask him.

180
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,799
Maybe he will explain to you.

181
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,268
"In that case, who heals?"
"Doctor Romer.

182
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,799
"He's a sclerotist."
"But he plays bridge well."

183
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,916
That is, he loses
wonderfully to dad.

184
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,399
Is it not possible to call a
serious doctor to the father?

185
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,789
You speak as if you do
not know your father.

186
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,597
It's more than likely that
Wit could forget Daddy.

187
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,079
And you must know that
he is a rare guest here,

188
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,275
last time was 6 years ago

189
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,112
and very quickly left because of the
difference in opinion with the daddy.

190
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,759
You can not do without memories?

191
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,228
No. I can not.

192
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,832
Well, it's time for me.

193
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,072
No, it's dinner.

194
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,679
- But, I really need to go.
- Come on!

195
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,272
Now there will be tea.

196
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,916
No, stay, if you can, until you
find out with your father.

197
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,797
Is it not necessary for
someone to be with him?

198
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,556
How to wake up, he will let me know.

199
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,437
We talk here, we can not hear.

200
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,679
Well, no, tell me
what happened here.

201
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,759
You telegraph that the
condition is serious.

202
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,319
Because it's serious.

203
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,239
Then I do not understand.
I just do not understand,

204
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,075
how can a sick person
be left unattended.

205
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,276
We do not take good care of Daddy.

206
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,994
Do you hear, Aunt?

207
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,675
Wit believes that we do not
take good care of Daddy.

208
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,319
Itself is good!

209
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,119
When last year my father wore
buckets of water all winter long,

210
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,430
because the pipes burst,
then his heart did not hurt!

211
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,996
I did not wash at all for two months.

212
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,715
But no one forced you
to live in this house.

213
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,118
Well, never mind, it's such
a way of life... Vita.

214
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,199
We really love each other,

215
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,668
only platonic, at a distance.

216
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,832
Well, what is he like now? Well?

217
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,913
Look, you'll collapse.

218
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,478
No, I will not.

219
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,071
Well, what it is now, tell me.

220
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,959
Well, I can not betray a friend.

221
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Oh, give it away!

222
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,520
And I'll tell you everything
about him, I'll give out,

223
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,553
although he is my brother.

224
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,318
You can not imagine how
he was a good, sweet boy.

225
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,678
Mom's favorite.

226
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,474
And he was hardworking and polite.

227
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,038
And how conscientiously
he served in the temple.

228
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,232
Do you know that he
served in the temple?

229
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,996
Yes, and treated
animals perfectly.

230
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:18,116
And then he was with the hermits
and got under bad influence there.

231
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,279
Well, he decided that he did
not want to see us anymore.

232
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,194
Come, look, this is Vitek, and this is me.

233
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,358
Does he look like an angel?

234
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,993
And, truly, in the depths of
my soul I stayed like this.

235
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,199
He probably thinks about us.

236
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,794
Or maybe he is praying in secret.

237
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,279
Praying? It's impossible.

238
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,794
A member of the society of secular schools.

239
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,159
An activist? Ha, ha, ha!

240
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,798
The figure! Vit.

241
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,073
- Bella!
- Watch out!

242
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,912
Well, what did you do?

243
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,239
Floor...

244
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,229
sold...

245
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,719
in antiques.

246
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,073
Watch it too...

247
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,716
And the sconces, those
silver ones, remember?

248
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,033
Also sold...

249
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:14,554
And the carpet on which you are going is sold,
and in a month it will be taken away for coal.

250
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,674
Well, are you offended?

251
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,911
- No.
- No?

252
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,318
Or maybe you should
ask your opinion.

253
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,070
Legally there is your share...

254
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,238
Oh, well, yes, there's Mummy.

255
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,639
And we'll sell Mom too.

256
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,596
Only for pennies, it's not old.

257
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,233
Well, if only to draw her a halo,
then she can go for the Madonna.

258
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,719
Icons are now fashionable, are not they?

259
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,193
Some American will
buy our mummy.

260
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,991
Bella, Bella,

261
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,472
why should I always do
everything in this house alone.

262
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,038
I have nothing against,
you are doing great.

263
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,839
You, Bella, I advise you, do not be daring.

264
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,599
You know perfectly well that I am
the only one working in this house,

265
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,959
and you come here as a guest
to rest, from time to time,

266
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,999
when at you this suspicious company
from a tavern disintegrates!

267
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,518
Aunt hints that I am a
secular way of life.

268
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,079
Well, of course, a secular way of life!

269
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,919
You really do not know that
it does not work at all.

270
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,639
Because I do not like.

271
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,719
Yes, I know that you like it!

272
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,154
That's it.
What do you want to bring from the garden?

273
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,756
Do you know why it does not work?

274
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,319
What do you want to bring from the garden?

275
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,878
Dill and salad.

276
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,439
Excuse me, please, Pan, but in
this house all the abnormal.

277
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,759
Even the dog.

278
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,274
You might not want to
demonstrate with my friends.

279
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,399
In the end, these
are normal people,

280
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,399
and they do not need to know about all
the pitiful secrets of this house.

281
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,597
Do not cling. You yourself
brought this guy here.

282
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,472
To be precise, it was
he who brought me.

283
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,590
Clearly, it means that you
have not yet earned a car.

284
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,194
Maybe I'll earn some more.

285
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,918
Maybe you're hungry?

286
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,633
So take it and eat it.

287
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,519
No I do not like...

288
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,193
"What's that noise?"
- Wait a minute. It's true, father. I myself.

289
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,877
Caligari, well, come on, let's go,

290
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,993
Caligari, come on...

291
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,629
We go, we go.

292
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,958
You have a beautiful garden.

293
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,797
Grandpa wanted to create a
wonderful paradise garden here.

294
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,353
Wrote flowers, which,
of course, froze.

295
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,077
And then there was a corner of lovers.

296
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,431
And this is the goddess of love.

297
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,719
You see, here, where
these block houses are,

298
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,631
also once was our park.

299
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,159
It is planned to build it all.

300
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,038
In the meantime, we sell
everything we can by pieces.

301
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,993
And who is your father?

302
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,989
Well?

303
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,472
Well, not a priest?

304
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,676
No. A man.

305
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,160
That is... the tiller.

306
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,633
Yes, the peasant.

307
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,399
Peasant.

308
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,597
So nobody bothers you.

309
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,956
"No one bothers Vita either."
Because Wit is special.

310
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,399
Caligari, Caligari,

311
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,913
Come on, let's go, Caligari!

312
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,912
Do you lock it from your father?

313
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,351
I did not invent it, he himself asked.

314
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,474
- So, then, still drinking?
- Yet!

315
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,192
So you do not know that he
was treated for alcoholism?

316
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,639
Well, now?

317
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,752
Now? I do not know.

318
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,520
What does it mean "I do not know"?

319
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,878
Listen, Wit, this kind of talk about
the main thing is not with me.

320
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,116
My business is a kitchen, pots.

321
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,399
I heard that Bella said.

322
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,313
And, however, when the father
gets up, he'll talk to him.

323
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,275
How does it "stand up"?
"Well, there will be dinner."

324
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,319
Dinner will not be.

325
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,959
Why all this lies with the telegram?

326
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,953
So that you finally understand that you
have responsibilities in this house.

327
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,716
Caligari trampled all
the beds of the salad.

328
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,679
And the dill is gone.

329
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,717
I always said that this dog
should be kept on a chain.

330
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,513
Through my dead body!

331
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,239
I will never agree to this, I
must be completely heartless,

332
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,799
to offer such things.

333
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,552
Who sent the telegram?

334
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,228
Bella.

335
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,750
Do not let the dog come here! Caligari!

336
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,074
Caligari, come here!

337
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,679
Ugly! Get out of here!

338
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,477
"He will not bite?"
- Go away!

339
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,793
Now back.

340
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,953
Close the doors!

341
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,551
"Did you send a telegram?"
- I.

342
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,149
For what?

343
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,951
Ham, the female offender.

344
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,471
Damn, he wanted to grab my hand.

345
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,437
My name is Brown.

346
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,119
Sobota.

347
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,399
Student Vita.

348
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,673
Ah, very nice, please, I beg of you.

349
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,118
Please sit down.

350
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,716
So you are a colleague of my son?

351
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,994
Yadzya, do not get distracted, do dinner.

352
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,879
You, really, are hungry after a trip.

353
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,552
Bella, sit down properly.

354
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,429
So you are the friend of
the person who was my son.

355
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,993
You, indeed, are surprised
that I speak in the past.

356
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,439
No, no, this man is not dead, no,

357
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,113
and in the sense of the
law he remains my son,

358
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:09,512
as it is in the biological
sense, flesh of my flesh.

359
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,438
Only my mother knows for sure.

360
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,631
Bella, not sharp, and then I'll put it out.

361
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,279
So, your friend
gave up his duties

362
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,840
and, thus, lost his rights.

363
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,832
Has ceased to be our son.

364
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,150
It seems to him that
he has chosen freedom,

365
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,511
but this, of course, is only an illusion.

366
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,276
He just ran out of the house.

367
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,399
It seems that he now
lives in Chorzow?

368
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,799
Yes.

369
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,432
What are you looking for?

370
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,031
What is this person looking for?

371
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,519
Train schedule.

372
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,158
And where are you going?

373
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,351
I ask: Where are you going?

374
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,030
"Are you talking to me?"
Yes, to you.

375
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,079
To Warsaw.

376
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,039
What does it matter?

377
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,239
In vain you hurry.
No one puts you up.

378
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,391
Once in six years you can drink tea
in the house in which you grew up.

379
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,551
Excuse me, I really need to go.

380
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,239
I'll drop in again in Warsaw, and in
the morning I have to be in Chorzow.

381
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,319
And there can be no talk,
dinner on the table.

382
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,231
Excuse me, but I really need it.

383
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,559
If I can ask you for anything,

384
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,959
if a stranger, an old man
can ask you for something,

385
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,757
then I ask you to stay.

386
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,437
There is nothing to ask him.

387
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,638
He will not go anyway.

388
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,474
Why?

389
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,239
Because it's dark, but your car
does not have lights, sit down.

390
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,037
"How can it not be?"
But not here.

391
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,073
No far, no passing
beam, no stop signal.

392
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,953
And what happened to them?

393
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,396
I unscrewed the fuses.

394
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,592
What? Do not trust?

395
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,152
I can twist it.

396
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,595
Stay, if you want, I
already have a train.

397
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,679
Wit!

398
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,711
Leave these theatrical gestures!

399
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,671
It's not I who arrange a theater here.

400
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,554
You ruined such a wonderful
scene for your father.

401
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,434
He pondered it for 6 years.

402
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,518
You see? You are funny.

403
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,635
Spare yourself and us from cheap gestures.

404
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,079
Excuse me, these are family matters.

405
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,559
Your friend is to blame
for us and so I'm glad,

406
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,799
that you will become an
objective witness here.

407
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,119
Sit down!

408
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,995
He becomes more
and more like me.

409
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,678
Especially now.

410
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,993
How old are you?

411
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,760
Well, at least you
could remember that.

412
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,595
I'll remind Daddy when it was -

413
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,479
it was when we wanted
to add a family,

414
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,118
that lived opposite.

415
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,631
In the autumn, in the 45th.

416
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,353
The doctor gave a certificate
that there will be twins,

417
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,832
and Vit saved us from condensation.

418
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,634
Vit is our only
hope to this day.

419
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,670
Listen, Marek, you really
want to wash your hands.

420
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,911
Show him where the bathroom is.

421
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,998
I'll show you.

422
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,239
Well, let's go.

423
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,876
Did you have anything in
common with this telegram?

424
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,719
Hence, had.

425
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,877
What? Bella called me
without your knowledge?

426
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,750
Accident? What happened?

427
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,559
Tell me, finally,
what's going on here?

428
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,799
What's wrong with you, actually?
You die - do not you die?

429
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,438
Do you need help?

430
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,509
I see I disappointed you.
You came with the idea of a funeral.

431
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,193
Leave it.

432
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,479
I want to know why
you called me here,

433
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,359
What do you want from
me, and what do I do.

434
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,669
So far enough that you are here.

435
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,519
There are worms.

436
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,953
The centipedes.

437
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:11,473
They creep out after the rain,
and Caligari loves to lick them.

438
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,912
It's an abomination, right?

439
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,073
Have you ever considered a
person's skin under a microscope?

440
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,236
Pores like craters.

441
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,434
Too nasty, nasty...

442
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,155
"Ugly hands."
- I know.

443
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,748
Never mind.

444
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,312
I love an abomination.

445
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,432
I'm a humanist, true.

446
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,238
Love people...,

447
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,108
you understand?

448
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,198
Yes, I understand...

449
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,071
Do not try to be smart.

450
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,955
You do not even know how
much you lose on this.

451
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,714
Bella!!

452
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,359
Bella, are you taking the
guest in the bathroom again?

453
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,278
What does it mean: Again?

454
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,272
Should I answer you?

455
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,513
You know that this woman -
a stranger in our house?

456
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,913
She's a parvenu.

457
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,199
Be careful with this girl.

458
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,191
Come on. The Envious One.

459
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,955
Please, sit down, please.
I ask you to.

460
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,639
Thank you.

461
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,279
You'll forgive me for being so Spartan,

462
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,317
but his wife is abroad, and the
whole house is a little lame.

463
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,838
Yadzya, stop messing
around and sit down.

464
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,159
Put some alcohol on the table.
We have guests.

465
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,479
I, unfortunately, at the wheel.

466
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,436
So in fact till the morning
you will sober up.

467
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,718
No, I must go. I would not want
to make it difficult for you.

468
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,518
Do not fool around.
Where are you going to spend your night?

469
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,275
Places are enough.
In the morning, go.

470
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,631
Yadzya, I told you.

471
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,079
Do not force yourself to
persuade, take, impose.

472
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,479
Thank you.

473
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,637
I told you that I do not drink.

474
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,752
I do not persuade.

475
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,039
Well, for the health of
the guests, Pan Marek.

476
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,758
All the best.

477
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,909
Well! Daddy will arrange
a concert for us today.

478
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,593
What did you say?

479
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,074
It's a secret.

480
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,954
At guests do not talk about secrets.
Repeat what you said.

481
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,830
I was sorry for what is
waiting for us today.

482
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,868
She was sorry.

483
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,951
This girl is always unhappy.

484
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,878
Always offended.

485
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,919
Did she tell you she was in prison?

486
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,439
Dad!

487
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,715
I'm only asking if
you mentioned this.

488
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,599
I did not say why.

489
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,511
And Dad was also sitting.

490
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,710
Indeed, he was sitting,
almost two weeks.

491
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,477
Prophylactically, so to speak.

492
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,557
During nationalization.

493
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,990
Then, as a rule, everyone was put.

494
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,357
Fearful of sabotage.

495
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,238
And Wit did not tell you that
this factory belonged to us?

496
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,709
No.

497
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,318
You see, my great-grandfather,
Alfred Brown,

498
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,159
was a dissident and
arrived in Poland,

499
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,310
escaping religious persecution.

500
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,639
He built a workshop here.

501
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,471
History goes in a circle.

502
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,109
At the beginning and at
the end was a workshop.

503
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,877
Alfred reached the point
that he had 20 employees.

504
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,439
Over there, the kind of enterprise
of the middle of the last century.

505
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,838
You can view.

506
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,839
After it the factory was headed
by the grandfather Wlodimierz,

507
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,032
he also expanded it...

508
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,999
and contrary to what you are
taught in the lessons of Marxism,

509
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,797
he was not an exploiter.

510
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:11,799
Before the war I began to
produce laboratory glass,

511
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,516
and laboratory equipment,

512
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,716
and even bought Zeiss license.

513
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:30,508
And they are now expanding
the fireproof glass shop...

514
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,314
heat-resistant glass
and heat treatment,

515
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,072
many export...

516
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,231
To Holland, to France.

517
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,359
After all, heat-resistant glass today -

518
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,352
the important thing for everything...

519
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,399
even in satellites.

520
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,470
Bella, stop, the piano is upset!

521
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,675
The pope was a harbinger of the
latest achievements of technology.

522
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,469
This girl ruined her talent.

523
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,319
Her mother is incredibly musical.

524
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,153
My mother is incredible... musical!

525
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,631
My children are ruining themselves.

526
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,274
Wit - too.

527
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,028
Why is that?

528
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,077
I see you do not know,

529
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,435
but Vit is an excellent specialist.

530
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,753
Do not try, Marek.

531
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,474
I try to pass the fire,

532
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,637
where shadows grow,

533
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,595
immersed in the pristine
abyss of nothingness.

534
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,552
Wash happy,

535
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,671
which life does not know.

536
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,319
Fire, the eternal element,

537
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,279
but in you is liberation.

538
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,236
Well, how did you like it?

539
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,559
"I do not know, I do not understand this."
Never mind.

540
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,878
Well, who wrote this?

541
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,275
Well?

542
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,513
Slovak? Byron?

543
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,039
Schopenhauer?

544
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,758
I'm not a fan of poetry.

545
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,080
You see, daddy, he does
not know who wrote this.

546
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,118
I wrote this.

547
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,150
In the end, there is
nothing to be ashamed of.

548
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,119
You're right, there is nothing.

549
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,076
Has published at own expense.

550
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,157
No one has lost it.

551
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,559
Now the state pays for writers.

552
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,633
And I became an industrialist
instead of a poet.

553
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,875
Go for the tube to
my room upstairs.

554
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,475
You will not smoke both at the same time.

555
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,118
And this you will carry.

556
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,911
I did not ask you. You're a guest.

557
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,516
You must be very tired.

558
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,913
"I'll make you a bed now."

559
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,878
Do not drink, Father.

560
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,119
From what?

561
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,759
By what right do you want
to forbid me something?

562
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,116
By the right of the son, you mean.

563
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,315
After all, you denied
me this right.

564
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,993
What does it mean, refused?

565
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,876
In your opinion, sons of love -
it's a love for the things that you love,

566
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,118
to this garden, to this wreckage,
to the sweats in the bathroom?

567
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,631
Without this, you can not love everything?

568
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,274
You can not.

569
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,550
In that case, I'm a geek.

570
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,072
You think you're a geek.

571
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:58,078
You would like to be, but
you overestimate yourself.

572
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,599
I know that in the end
you will return to us.

573
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,751
How do you know?
Why do you predict a loss to me?

574
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,908
This is cowardly.

575
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,317
I know, because I myself once
wanted to get out of here.

576
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,352
I once wanted to quit
this house, this circle.

577
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,993
And you look like me.

578
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,878
Predefine in advance.

579
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,192
You say I look like you.

580
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,875
Or maybe I should ask if
I want to be like that.

581
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,478
You know that I do not want to.

582
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,479
Each person has his own limit -

583
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,159
you can not jump yourself.

584
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,675
No, Wit. You generally overestimate
the strength of the will of man.

585
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,076
You overestimate the power of personality.

586
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,079
I do not know why you are taught
Marxism in the university.

587
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,999
You speak of an isolated person, about
the character and strength of the will,

588
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,959
but you forget about all conditionality -

589
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,669
social, class, biological,
historical and so on.

590
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,794
That's it.

591
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,389
It is - I changed
my conditionality.

592
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,592
Its history has changed.
You yourself would not have done this.

593
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,550
Do not forget that you have always
been in a privileged position.

594
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,036
The child studied English.

595
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,439
And then another couple
of years was a governess.

596
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,079
Can you compare yourself with
an ordinary peasant son?

597
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,914
Yes, you just forget that in high
school I lived on a scholarship

598
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:26,239
and fed up at the expense of parcels,
which were given to peasant children,

599
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,514
for example, Marek.

600
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:31,554
And I was not, as he, accustomed to the fact
that at five in the morning to kindle a stove

601
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,989
and potato grout is
six times a week.

602
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,312
You would not have experienced
this if we had a factory.

603
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,312
You know, I understand why you
have to say that now, but...

604
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,190
I have a serious advantage
in front of you.

605
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,674
What kind?

606
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,957
I do not really need
to convince you now.

607
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,637
You, Wit, are a terrible egoist,

608
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,710
You want only to save yourself,
and nothing interests you more.

609
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,399
But you do not understand that
you are digging your own grave.

610
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,119
You can not live without roots.

611
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,475
Leave, I knew many,
they are doing great,

612
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,793
Do not look back,
live and rise up.

613
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,834
Up!

614
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,871
And where can you go up?

615
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,359
You're an engineer, even, maybe,
capable, if your friend does not lie.

616
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,397
So, what is next? You can
someday become a director.

617
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,836
Do you know how I
treated the directors?

618
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:32,237
Do not pretend, Vit, that you
need professional success, work.

619
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,073
It is not true.

620
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,957
You live only in denial,

621
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,034
You live in order to
prove something to me.

622
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,999
You live in defiance of me, Bella,
my aunt, against this house...

623
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:53,310
and therefore, when we are not,
you will feel a huge emptiness.

624
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,431
Bring firewood, let's light the fireplace.

625
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,789
After all, there is.

626
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,957
I beg you, bring it.

627
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,238
Where to bring?

628
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,313
From the workshop.

629
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,676
Excuse me, I need a key
from the workshop.

630
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,714
Through the window... enter...

631
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,754
True, through the window.
I'll escort you.

632
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,119
Bella, what did I send you for?

633
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,150
"Behind the straw."
Not necessary.

634
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,159
Leave Vita, go, help
your aunt wash dishes.

635
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,519
In the meantime, I'll
talk with Marek.

636
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,273
Daddy wants to talk with Marek.

637
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,639
Yes?

638
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,958
Well, what, Marek?

639
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,636
Well? You wanted to talk to me.

640
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,599
Yes Yes Yes.

641
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,836
You, really, traveled a lot?

642
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,792
Yes, I traveled.

643
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,229
I've been to India,
even several times.

644
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:14,479
You, of course, will be surprised,
you do not remember those times,

645
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,799
When a person could take a
train or even an airplane

646
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,599
and go wherever he wants.

647
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,079
At least to India.

648
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,309
My father did not go much.

649
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,873
In vain it is he.

650
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,918
Well, it was...

651
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,759
And you know, if everything goes well,

652
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,876
then our enterprise
will build something,

653
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,199
just in India or in Pakistan.

654
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,919
Well then...

655
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,638
It is wonderful.

656
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,230
Yes, we would then... went.

657
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:43,077
"Well, and when did this happen?"
Day before yesterday.

658
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,157
In addition to his father, no one was hurt?

659
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,150
The employee just had a day off.

660
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,513
- What is the next?
- Do not ask silly questions.

661
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,553
Answer yourself.

662
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,475
Listen, Marek, you
forgot to lock the car.

663
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,036
What are you? Are you afraid for this junk?

664
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,678
Junk is not junk, there can always
be someone spinning around.

665
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,597
"Was the workshop insured?"
It's insured!

666
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:53,756
If I had been insured, my father
would not have summoned you here.

667
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,597
So, it was you who called me.

668
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,595
Well, you see, Vit.

669
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,355
So, now ask me for forgiveness.

670
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,632
With witnesses, well.

671
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,079
"Do you know how it happened?"
"Bella, go away."

672
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,159
Do you know how it happened?

673
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,151
I told you: Get out of here.

674
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,518
But Vit must know if
he should help us.

675
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,669
Wit does not yet know what
you were sitting for.

676
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,199
A year is conditional for
insulting the authorities.

677
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,713
And something for that.

678
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,479
For prostitution.

679
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,157
Well, now I'll tell
you how it happened.

680
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,148
The father drove moonshine in the workshop.

681
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,273
A secret from my aunt.

682
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,836
- Well, it exploded.
- You're lying!

683
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:49,159
To whom are you saying this?
I was at the same time.

684
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,951
Have put the boys to bed with me.

685
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,837
I'll sleep on the veranda.

686
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,430
Well, that's enough. Enough!

687
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,519
Get out of here.

688
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,439
I do not have long left, Vit.

689
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,314
Father...

690
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,758
I wanted to tell you a
lot, it does not matter.

691
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,719
Listen,

692
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,952
you told me today -
it's good that I'm here, right?

693
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,759
So listen...

694
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,279
I'll stay, okay?

695
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,513
Or, if you want,

696
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,553
You know, I'm getting married soon...

697
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,950
and in fact you could settle with us.

698
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,518
Would not be so alone.

699
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,514
Tell me.

700
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,676
Do you want it? Tell me.

701
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,708
Tell me.

702
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,748
No.

703
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,948
Answer.

704
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,710
I do not want your sympathy.

705
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,234
Go away.

706
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,995
You ran away from home like a rat.

707
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,311
I told you: Go.

708
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:11,873
Anyway, you always
liked me something.

709
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,639
Pedestrians using
a daily crossroads.

710
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:57,191
Completion time:
The first quarter of next year.

711
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,995
So, we must wait until spring.

712
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:05,639
The 151st ship, built on
the Szczecin shipyard,

713
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,239
the first of twenty-one,

714
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:10,479
ordered by the Polish armature
"Polish Maritime Shipping",

715
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,630
dry cargo ship "Silesian rebel".

716
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:17,159
In the presence of numerous delegations
of those who three times took up arms,

717
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,355
to protect Poland's
right to Silesia,

718
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:22,919
The new Polish thirty-two thousand
comes off the slipways "Vulcan",

719
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,999
to serve the glory of the
Polish merchant marine.

720
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,356
In these days Silesia was visited by a
delegation of Indian industrialists.

721
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,559
The goal is to purchase
complete industrial equipment.

722
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:35,159
Visitors, visiting our
metallurgical enterprises,

723
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:39,039
carefully observed the cycle of
production of the highest quality steel.

724
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:42,159
They were keenly interested not
only in production results,

725
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,119
but also the working
conditions at the enterprise.

726
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:47,399
In a number of conversations with
representatives of our metallurgical industry.

727
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,073
The topics of interest to
both sides were touched upon.

728
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:55,230
On the last day of the visit, the guests laid
flowers at the monument to the heroes of Silesia.

729
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,599
The European Cup!
At the stadium "Legia"

730
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,959
in the pouring rain.

731
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:04,952
The Belgian "Standard"
and the Warsaw "Legia"...

732
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,113
Why are you closing?

733
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,397
We will suffocate.

734
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,070
You want us to be robbed, right?

735
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:27,116
What? Tell me, what can they steal from us?

736
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:32,557
You speak just like your little sister,
she always leaves everything open.

737
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,995
Only she hopes that maybe
someone will kidnap her.

738
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,919
But so far there are no volunteers.

739
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,990
Come on, I'll give you a towel.

740
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,432
Does your mother write to you often?

741
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,278
Often? Regularly, once a month.

742
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,029
And what does he write recently?

743
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,875
Lately? What always writes,

744
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:08,959
she's very business-like, you seem
to have inherited it from her.

745
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,599
When will it be back?

746
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,079
Will he be back?

747
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,751
Will come back. Where? In this slum?

748
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,469
To these ruins?
Absence of everything?

749
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,757
Who told you that she would return?

750
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,468
Father.

751
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,358
She - to him!

752
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:32,908
He only seems that he
was someone for her.

753
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,159
Believe me, I know better.

754
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,993
"What does the mother write?"
What he writes what always.

755
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:44,912
Two pairs of socks, some nylon
shirts in a commission,

756
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,228
in conclusion - a whole, Zulia.

757
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,111
It was a very fashionable name,

758
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:55,233
naturally not in life,
but for the stage.

759
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,395
And she always knew how to be fashionable.

760
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,231
- This is bad?
- No.

761
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,470
Only depends, at whose expense.

762
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,997
What are you talking about, aunt?

763
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,355
You're stupid, just like your father.

764
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,752
What did you want to say?
How much do I owe her?

765
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,599
Terribly owes much -

766
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,672
this crumbling slum and
the worn out hands.

767
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,156
- True?
- Yes, that's it.

768
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,479
I thought that if she
does, then I am with her.

769
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:38,878
She was younger, prettier, and she
had a talent for this, you know...

770
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,755
Father knew everything about her.

771
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,711
Only it excites him.

772
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:59,074
And you, in fact, are
very much like him.

773
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,871
Good night. I will repay.

774
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,150
I'm sorry that you
had to wait for me.

775
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:07,555
Actually, I need to
apologize to you for that,

776
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,709
witness what you
had today to be.

777
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,598
Never mind, Vit.

778
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,350
You, truly, are offended at me, that
I have been for so many years...

779
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,670
That I did not tell you
anything about our house.

780
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,278
Late already, let's sleep.

781
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,839
The torch is below, but
there is no more water.

782
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,235
Well?

783
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,075
The belly lost the towel.

784
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,989
We'll take them out so as not to wake him.

785
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:29,438
As a purr, a Renaissance pussy,

786
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:32,399
and now Marecek will lie
down near Bellyuni,

787
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,156
quietly fall asleep.

788
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,958
Do you sleep?

789
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,759
Are you asleep?

790
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,474
I'm waiting in the garden,

791
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,231
you can go out the window,

792
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,716
just look, there's nettle.

793
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,159
Well?

794
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,752
What are you watching?

795
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:33,908
Pig!

796
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,909
Drive carefully, because you
are slightly under the fly.

797
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:31,393
Do not worry.

798
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,310
Listen, old man, I
told you: "I'm sorry"?

799
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,719
So I told you "sorry" or not?

800
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,239
No, that's not the point.

801
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:46,680
No, I told you to "excuse me,"
and that's the point, you know?

802
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,759
What are you telling me here?

803
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:53,960
Go carefully, because you're under a fly,
get dressed, otherwise you'll get cold.

804
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,119
And if you would instead come to
me and gave me just on the muzzle.

805
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:00,031
You are not capable of this?

806
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,834
Remember in the hostel, I...

807
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:08,230
you knew everything about me, I told
you, who is my old man, who...,

808
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,239
and you - nothing.

809
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,839
When you received this
telegram, I thought, damn it,

810
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,439
I must come here, I
must see this hut,

811
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,159
entered and circus,

812
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:20,879
Bella, Vit, brother, Caligari,
what kind of house, God you are!

813
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,639
The old man is ill, my
aunt is working hard,

814
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,839
but what are you doing, you washed your
hands, brother, and gave you a hand?

815
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,359
Because you do not care!

816
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,588
Why so scream?

817
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:29,840
Then.

818
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,916
How did you react to
me, brother, well?

819
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:34,633
How did you react to me here?

820
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,228
Bye, brother.

821
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,877
And I also wanted to
tell you one thing,

822
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:44,588
that never, never again,
when you come to Khozhov,

823
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:47,639
it will not be that we
are friends, you lost.

824
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:52,634
You know, you've always been
so good, better, you know.

825
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,354
And I...

826
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,759
Hey. What?

827
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,479
Moving yourself or pushing?

828
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,999
Thank you. I'll go.

829
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,195
And say hello to your sister.

830
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:06,079
Hell, I will not even tell you why it
happened that happened between us,

831
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,919
because you do not understand.

832
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,359
"Maybe..."
- What can?

833
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:10,588
What can? Till!

834
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:35,074
Bella, will you go with me to Chorzow?

835
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,279
Where?

836
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,952
To me, to a normal house.

837
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,919
How kind you are.

838
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,358
Okay, I'll go.

839
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,439
I beg.

840
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,838
What do you think? What?

841
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:04,513
What are you whistling and I'm going?

842
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:06,798
Do you think I have no one to go with?

843
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,519
Well, sit down, go.

844
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,519
Till!

845
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:35,719
Hole.

846
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:38,996
I'll tell you, I'll write it.

847
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:42,835
Here you go.

848
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:29,676
Why would you wake him up again?

849
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,833
I want to say goodbye.

850
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:39,352
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

851
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,194
Daddy, Vit wants to say goodbye.

852
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,398
He does not answer because
he thinks it's a supplier.

853
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,033
Well, come in.

854
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:06,514
Well, I refueled. He must have
reached the bar at night.

855
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,551
You, really, left the keys.

856
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,439
Really.

857
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,510
Wit, Wit...

858
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,308
Wit!

859
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:09,713
I told you - if you
stay and do a workshop,

860
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:13,555
then in six months you
will have your own car.

861
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,873
Yes.

862
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:26,993
Listen to this.

863
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:29,198
I very much ask you,

864
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,919
I implore you,

865
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,512
whatever happens,

866
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,593
do not write to me, do not wire,

867
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,199
as if I just died

868
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,714
or went somewhere.

869
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:46,148
The sleeve... will fall off.

870
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,393
I'll tell you.

871
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,351
No, do not. Thank you.

872
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,079
I, however, probably,

873
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:02,718
and so I will go abroad.
