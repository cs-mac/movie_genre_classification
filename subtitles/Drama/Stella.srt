- 0k.

21
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,046
Mrs Maria...

22
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,363
My daughter isn't happy.

23
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,916
She always sings first,
as if Stella is the star.

24
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,860
That's what we agreed on
from the beginning.

25
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,072
But now we have offers galore.
We're nightingales proper.

26
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,213
Besides, my Anneta SINGS.
She doesn't croak like Stella.

27
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,249
Yew mrs Euterpe, but it's Stella
who packs them in.

28
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,421
She's trying out a new
number and she's all nerves.

29
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,121
Hello Aleko. What was my mom
grumping about this time'!

30
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,009
She resents your going out first.

31
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,190
- I told her to stay away.
- She's like any mother.

32
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,904
- Ambitious for her daughter.
- Some ambition! Singing in a taverns!

33
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,793
Why's it a bad thing?
I'll check if Stella's ready.

34
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,842
<i>- How have you been'?
- How eke“!?</i>

35
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,895
Getting plainer every day
while Stella blooms.

36
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,181
And why wouldn't she... As if too many
gentlemen like you ever cared for her?

37
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,383
Go ask Mitsos. AH she ever
befriended with were mostly scums.

38
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,211
- Isn't that so, Mitso?
- Keep me out of it. I'm just doing my job.

39
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,932
And when she's through with you,
she'll go back to her bums.

40
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,644
Why are you telling me this?
Something she said?

41
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,536
No, but I know
Stella inside out.

42
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,446
She doesn't care about money.
She's proud that way.

43
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,018
But when she falls for a guy,
it's all the way.

44
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,076
And after a couple of months,
she gets over it, right?

45
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,368
It's the fault of you men,
she says, for being so selfish.

46
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,099
In other words,
my time is up?

47
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,610
- The lights!
- Lights out!

48
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,800
- New tricks tonight?
- She'll dance in a spotlight.

49
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,412
- She saw it in the movies and liked it.
- Yeah, big thing.

50
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,566
Drums!

51
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,068
Higher!

52
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,463
Higher!

53
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,825
What's that bastard doing?

54
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,280
- I find her disgusting.
- The men don't.

55
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,282
Out of my way!

56
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,647
That old witch!
She put the jinx on me.

57
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,098
I don't care if she
is Anneta's mother.

58
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,834
She'll never ever set another foot in here!

59
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,461
Where's my shirt?

60
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,673
- Stella!
- Here it is!

61
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,779
May I offer my congratulations?

62
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,278
Are you putting me on?

63
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,903
Just once I try to do
something artistic...

64
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,678
and I make a fool of myself.

65
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,256
Some joint!

66
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,210
- What's wrong with it?
- It doesn't even have a piano!

67
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,912
It has a whole orchestra.

68
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,032
Try doing a classy number
with bouzouki music!

69
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,401
I'll get myself a piano,
you wait!

70
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,972
Be patient and I'll get it
for you, doll!

71
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,560
I'm not patient.
You know me.

72
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,326
Sure I do. May others had a heart just
like Stella's here. Right, Aleko?

73
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,423
- Not even a smile for me?
- Lay off, Aleko.

74
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,485
- Come on, it wasn't so tragic.
- For me it was! I'm not Anneta.

75
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,971
- What was she going on about?
- Nothing that matters.

76
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,913
Think I don't know?
It's always the same.

77
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,902
Whenever I'm stuck on someone,
she tries to snatch him away.

78
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,537
And the lies she tells!

79
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,809
Yet deep down she loves you.

80
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,157
She's a good girl. Trouble is,
she's too set on getting married...

81
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,817
and that's not healthy,
not in our line of work.

82
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,235
- And you, Stella? What do you want?
- You know what I want.

83
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,705
To sing, dance and have all the men
at my feet.

84
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,568
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

85
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,643
And the man
who loves you?

86
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,240
He'll love me
and be happy I'm his.

87
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,713
Do you love me, Stella?

88
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,898
Careful guys! My piano!
It's new dammit!

89
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,355
Careful! My piano!

90
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,230
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

91
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,276
You swear you can afford it?

92
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,328
- You wanted a piano, right?
- Yeah but. .

93
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,329
- Like it?
- Adore it.

94
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,769
I'm coming.
Help me 11P-

95
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,740
Are you going
to sit up there?

96
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,559
Where else?
Leave my piano alone? No way man!

97
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,563
Slow down.
We're going past the competition!

98
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,924
Come on out!

99
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,153
- What's going on?
- I want Pepe, the pianist.

100
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,840
Okay.
He)', Antigone!

101
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,916
They want Pepe!

102
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,282
- Where's Pepe?
- He isn't here.

103
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,709
- Is he playing somewhere?
- Wherever they ask him.

104
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,161
I've got work for him.
I need him right away.

105
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,732
He's playing
at some wedding.

106
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,934
- Where?
- In Piraeus, the little port.

107
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,176
Thank you. First we'll drop the piano
at the Paradise.

108
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,980
To your health, Pepe!

109
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,781
To the happy couple!

110
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,247
To your health, Milto!

111
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,963
- Hi guys! Can anyone give a hand here?
- Gladly!

112
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,536
- Wow!!
- Hi there baby!

113
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,159
Hello guys, I missed you all.
Where have you been?

114
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,582
A beautiful piano,
all black and shiny!

115
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,315
- What make?
- The best there is.

116
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,865
Who's that good-looking guy?
Looks familiar.

117
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,127
It's Milto, the soccer player.
of Olympiakos

118
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,145
- The bestest!
- The greatest.

119
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,652
So, Pepe,
like we said... tonight.

120
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,728
- Leaving so soon?
- Yes.

121
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,247
- Why?
- Keep your hand, I've one too many here!

122
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,146
- What's your name?
- Your hand!

123
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,089
- Mine's Miltos.
- Who cares?

124
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,873
- Where are you going?
- Anywhere I like.

125
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,501
I'd like you to stay.

126
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,926
Something tells me
we like different things.

127
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,310
Something tells me
you're wrong.

128
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,164
It's getting light.

129
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,793
That Paradise poster
down there, is new?

130
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,054
Yesterday's. It was my idea.
I like to look at it.

131
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,464
My hair needs dyeing.

132
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,052
- Stella?
- What'!

133
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,476
- What are you thinking?
- Shall I have it dyed red?

134
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,529
- Stella... Know what I'm thinking?
- What my boy?

135
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,198
I hate having to leave every morning
like a thief.

136
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,380
- I'd like us to be different.
- I say we're fine.

137
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,572
- For how long?
- What's gotten into you lately?

138
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,395
I'm afraid you'll leave me,
and if you do...

139
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,026
Why don't you want
to marry me'!

140
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,583
If you're starting that talk again,
then better go.

141
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,052
- I can't help thinking of it.
- And I can't help resenting it.

142
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,849
But why Stella, why?

143
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,430
You can't possibly like the life
you lead... Maria, Anneta, mitsos...

144
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,168
What's wrong with them?
Not classy enough for you?

145
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,983
No Stella. You're so much better.
Why don't you want to change?

146
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,135
To change and be what like?
You're insulting me!

147
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,794
No, Stella. When you love someone,
it's only natural...

148
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,675
Not to me! I love people for
what they are. I ask no more.

149
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,304
I've told you a thousand times:
if you don;t want to kill mylove for you,

150
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,409
love me as I am!
But you just don't listen!

151
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,910
If that doesn't suit you,
go back to your world...

152
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,144
and leave me in peace!

153
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,781
Is there someone else'!

154
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,502
Now you're being
really insulting.

155
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,827
Think I'm hiding something?
You should know me better.

156
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,316
When there's someone else,
you'll be the first to know.

157
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,690
I'm sorry.

158
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,354
Stella...

159
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,891
I'm going now.

160
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,279
Haven't seen Aleko around lately.

161
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,209
Think I haven't noticed?

162
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,686
- Did you have a fight?
- Kind of.

163
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,484
I bet he took it hard.

164
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,228
Unlike me, you mean...
living it up!

165
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,069
Stop that horrid bouzouki noise!

166
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,907
The past three nights
he hasn't gone out.

167
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,985
- At all?
- No.

168
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,758
Thank heavens.

169
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,818
What are you writing,
Aleko?

170
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,545
Poetry.

171
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,799
What about?

172
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,652
Bourgeois boredom.

173
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,108
Poetry my foot.

174
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,674
Instead of doing some real work.

175
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,836
- Don't start.
- You spoiled him.

176
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,997
- You know how sensitive he is.
- He only knows how to spent money

177
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,441
At least he's rid
of that ghastly woman!

178
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,444
What do you say Spyrettos?

179
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,337
I say stop it, for God's sakes.
You're choking him.

180
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,790
- Are you going out?
- Yes.

181
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,081
- At this late hour?
- Yes.

182
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,323
Why don't you sit here with us
my child. It's so nice.

183
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,385
Where to?

184
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,409
To the horrid bouzoukis.

185
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,939
<i>It's the thirteenth
of the month</i>

186
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,066
<i>My bad-luck day</i>

187
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:04,805
<i>I don't want to set eyes on</i>

188
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,138
<i>or greet a single soul</i>

189
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:19,382
<i>I don't want to set eyes on</i>

190
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,885
<i>or greet a single soul</i>

191
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,664
<i>Every time it's the thirteenth</i>

192
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,680
<i>I don't get out of bed</i>

193
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,160
<i>I close the doors and windows</i>

194
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,455
<i>But my eyes refuse to close</i>

195
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:05,800
<i>I close the doors and windows</i>

196
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:12,084
<i>But my eyes refuse to close</i>

197
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,388
<i>All together, everyone!</i>

198
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,481
<i>Cursed day, you've done me in</i>

199
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,071
<i>You've clipped my wings</i>

200
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:45,535
<i>Each time I full in love</i>

201
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,299
<i>You trip me up
and lay me low</i>

202
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,576
<i>Each time I full in love</i>

203
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,301
<i>You trip me up
and lay me low</i>

204
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,127
<i>They say I'm superstitious</i>

205
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,120
<i>The truth is I was fated</i>

206
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,986
<i>On the thirteenth
to be left an orphan</i>

207
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,899
<i>On the thirteenth
to become a widow</i>

208
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,198
<i>On the thirteenth
to be left an orphan</i>

209
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,560
<i>On the thirteenth
to become a widow</i>

210
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,933
- Well done Vassiliki!
- Thank you, thank you very much.

211
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,664
What is it?

212
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,280
A drunk driver wants to come in
with his car!

213
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,755
He'll wreck the place,
piano and all!

214
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,859
My piano?
We'll see about that!

215
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,774
Careful, we don't want
the people know.

216
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,712
Park that jalopy
and walk in like a man!

217
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,796
I want to drive in.

218
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,129
You're second best.
Others have driven in by train.

219
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,191
I do what I like,
remember?

220
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,574
If you have the guts,
do it.

221
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,426
He's dead drunk!

222
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,347
Don't be stupid Stella!

223
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,310
Come on, be a man!

224
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,532
I'm coming.

225
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,137
Stella! Get out of the way!
He'll kill you!

226
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,420
I took pity on you,
because you're an eyeful.

227
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,404
Pity that not all champions
have guts!

228
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,494
- So you know who I am?
- They say you have a way with the ball.

229
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,399
Will you park that thing?
It's blocking the entrance.

230
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,050
Tell me where to park.

231
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,020
- Wherever the hell you like.
- You show me.

232
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,982
Scared?

233
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,557
If Aleko comes,
tell him I'll be right back.

234
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,600
If his brakes hadn't worked,
kaput! COMING!

235
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,847
- So your name's Stella, eh?
- Stella!

236
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,743
Hey! Where are we going?

237
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,589
I'll take the next turn,
unless you care to go for a drive.

238
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,759
Like hell I do! Better turn
while you're still in one piece.

239
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,525
I've brought you a cognac.
It's on me.

240
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,401
Thanks.

241
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,404
- How long has it been?
- Almost 20 minutes.

242
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,736
She said she'd be back.

243
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,488
That's what she always says.

244
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,712
I remember last winter she
went off with this guy.

245
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,958
In fact, she was sitting at my
own table, but it's not it...

246
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,493
He said he'd show her
his motorbike...

247
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,380
Stop it!

248
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,109
And she didn't come back
till morning.

249
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,377
Aleco...

250
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,968
How could someone like you
get mixed up with her?

251
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,202
Look, you! We keep going
round and round!

252
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,620
I've lost my way.

253
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,785
Stop or I'll jump-

254
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,718
Don't try that stuff with me!
It won't work. Let me go!

255
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,228
- Aleko's waiting, eh?
- Yes.

256
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,078
- Who's Aleko?
- A gentleman.

257
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,083
- Who peels a pear with a knife?
- Yes.

258
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,054
- Then he's not for you.
- He loves me! And I melt.

259
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,570
- Wants to make a lady of you?
- He does.

260
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,812
- Poor bastard!
- Why?

261
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,377
- He's setting his house on fire.
- I'm the fire?

262
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,111
Yes. And a guy has to know
how to play or he'll get burned!

263
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,505
- And you do?
- So I say.

264
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,585
And I say you don't.

265
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,119
I have a match tomorrow.
If we win, I'll be coming round.

266
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,492
And if we lose,
I'll still be coming.

267
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,112
Anneta,
what's taking you so long?

268
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,559
Coming.

269
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,626
Bless you. The customers
are half asleep.

270
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,202
She won't be back, right'!

271
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,998
I told you so.

272
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,756
You fee] sorry for me,
don't you?

273
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,097
<i>- Y o“ do...
- l...</i>

274
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,492
I am pathetic indeed.

275
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,431
Should I pretend I don't care?

276
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,336
I do, I care terribly.
Why should I lie?

277
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,530
Why play the tough guy?
Well, I'm not.

278
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,724
A few days away from her
and I go to pieces.

279
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,112
Aleko, what's come over you?

280
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,741
And to think
I wanted to change her!

281
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,584
<i>Me...</i>

282
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,941
I know girls who'd change
their very skin for you.

283
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,410
You're very sweet, Anneta.

284
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,245
Where are you going?

285
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,741
I'm leaving.

286
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,278
It's all over.

287
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,673
Shall I come with you?

288
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,540
She's back, Anneta.

289
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,210
She's back.

290
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,464
Bravo!

291
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,500
Come on, Nlilto!

292
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,526
Come on, Nlilto!

293
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,315
Hey you kicked me hard there lady!

294
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,300
Foul! OUT!

295
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,228
Kick the Referee!

296
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,078
Murderers!

297
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,880
You murderers!!!

298
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,839
Good night.

299
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,979
- Goodnight Maria
- Goodnight there.

300
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,282
Where's Mr. Aleko tonight?

301
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,890
I told him not to come.

302
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,850
It's been a good night.
The piano brought us luck.

303
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,387
I feel sorry for him,
but I hate lying.

304
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,954
Shame.
He was a gentleman.

305
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,172
The best.

306
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,608
Even bought you a piano.

307
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,976
"I'll never forget you, "
I told him.

308
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,731
"You and the piano
will always be in my heart. "

309
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,589
- What did he say?
- His eyes filled with tears.

310
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,247
"Good-bye, Stella, "
he said and left...

311
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,926
after the soccer game.

312
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,472
Her new number drives them crazy.

313
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,046
- They broke five plates.
- What do you care if they pay?

314
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,185
Where d'you think the
three of them broke onto?

315
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,833
Stella, go on home, my girl.

316
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,211
In a minute.

317
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,813
Do you expect anyone special?

318
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,520
I was.
He'll pay for it, you wait!

319
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,049
Play, Pepe, play-

320
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,615
Why, here I am.

321
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,119
<i>0h my...</i>

322
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,266
- Get rid of him.
- Kiddiwme? I have wife and kids myself!

323
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,203
Let me then.

324
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,900
- The place is closed, mister.
- Open it then. For me!

325
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,024
Don't argue.

326
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,851
Okay, for you, but only
for a little while.

327
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,178
- Where would you like to sit?
- Everywhere.

328
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,663
- But for the moment, here.
- 0k.

329
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,948
- Where are the musicians?
- Having supper.

330
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,695
- Get them.
- Right.

331
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,608
- Where are you going?
- Inside.

332
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,611
Did I give you permission?
I'm the boss tonight.

333
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,136
Sure.

334
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,056
I'm a little drunk,
but even dry I'm the same way.

335
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,849
- What's your name?
- Mitso.

336
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,154
<i>Mine' s Mme.</i>

337
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,935
Now go tell that blonde doll
to come here.

338
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,181
He'll skin me alive.

339
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,952
Tell him to go to hell!

340
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,460
She's a little difficult.

341
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,381
- Well he said...
- Get the hell out of here!

342
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,299
I did my best, I swear.
Please don't make trouble.

343
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,609
Plese I beg you go tell him yourself.
He's ready to beat me up!

344
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,846
<i>She's a bit tough. Mr Mike...</i>

345
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,349
Cross my heart and hope to
die I did everythingl could.

346
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,937
Come on now... don't make
any trouble, allright?

347
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,420
- What's that?
- Dynamite.

348
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,699
I'll throw it to her
instead of a rose.

349
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,454
Stella! Run!
He's going to blow us all up!

350
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,676
I got to hand it to you.
You're a winner!

351
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,573
Get up.

352
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,563
That's how I knee]
when I like something.

353
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,193
I prefer you standing.

354
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,027
God, my girl, what eyes!

355
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,196
Yours aren't so bad either.

356
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,891
Break it up! What's this here eh?

357
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,272
Get us some wine.

358
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,776
Music!

359
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,017
- I like you, Stella.
- I know.

360
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,604
What about you?

361
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,950
- You were late.
- You waited for me'!

362
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,220
- I was sure you'd come.
- Why?

363
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,055
Because I wanted it.

364
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,997
I'll be coming every night.

365
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,508
And I'll sing for you.

366
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,473
And I'll cover the ground
you walk on with money.

367
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,125
Money doesn't impress me.

368
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,331
I like you, Stella.

369
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,828
You already said that.

370
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,542
Do you know how it feels
like to like a woman?

371
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,556
Like what?

372
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,443
Like entering a tiger's cage.

373
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,807
- Beat it.
- Let me pour the beer first!

374
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,368
BEAT IT!

375
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,335
I don't spoil women.

376
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,364
I like them as they are.

377
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,845
Meaning?

378
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,514
Others crawl into the cage
when the tiger's asleep.

379
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,064
Me, I wake it
and get it all worked up.

380
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,389
- Understand?
- Yes.

381
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,143
- Stella.
- What'!

382
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,832
I like you.

383
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,434
Stella, my love!

384
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,267
Kiss me!

385
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,917
Quietly.

386
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,562
This way, Stella!

387
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,113
Hello, Thodoros!

388
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,538
What's up. Everything allright there?

389
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,878
Hi Andreas, how're you doing?

390
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,505
Hello, Thanassi! You sexy old devil!
That belly of yours drives me crazy!

391
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,333
- Hello, Vassili!
- Hello, Stella!

392
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,825
- Christo!Look after the lady!
- Hey you!

393
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,809
Take anything you fancy.
Take me!

394
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,141
- What will your wife say?
- Who gives a damn?

395
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,124
How about
a juicy watermelon?

396
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,744
- How's Milto?
- Fine. We're going on a picnic.

397
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,852
Have fun! Wow, it's heavy! Christo!
Give Stella a hand, will ya?

398
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,210
Thanks, Vassili! Let's go my Christo.

399
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,841
- Hi gorgeous!
- Hi to you Manolis!

400
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,297
Thank you.

401
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,792
Excuse me.

402
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,922
- You're Miss Stella?
- Yeah, that's me.

403
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,833
- May I have a word with you?
- Sorry, I can't right now.

404
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,188
Wait!

405
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,760
Pm Aleko's sister.

406
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,079
- I'm busy.
- Please.

407
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,731
It's important.

408
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,599
Come on up.

409
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,788
Take a seat.

410
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,708
I don't like discussing
my affairs with strangers.

411
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,479
If Aleko wants something,
he should come himself.

412
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,947
Aleko is ill.

413
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,745
- He has a fever?
- No.

414
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,463
What, then?

415
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,216
It's his nerves.
A breakdown.

416
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,538
He's shut himself up
and won't see anyone.

417
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,955
If he doesn't have a fever,
then it's nothing serious.

418
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,150
The doctor is very worried.

419
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,479
- It happened once before and...
- And?

420
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,865
He tried to kill himself.

421
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,367
Heaven forbid!
What an idea.

422
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,350
You realize that
my coming here wasn't easy.

423
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,451
I know about your liaison
with Aleko and...

424
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:28,242
Then you must know also that this
"liaison" is over, days now.

425
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,509
We had a family council...

426
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,714
and decided
to give our consent.

427
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,102
To what'!

428
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,162
His marrying you,
of course.

429
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,491
Come again? You lost me here.

430
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,073
Marrying you.

431
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,508
Look here, you!

432
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,507
I may not be high society myself,
etiquete qnd all

433
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,256
but I don't go into people's homes
and insult them.

434
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,504
Who said I wanna marry
your precious sonny?

435
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,586
And if I did,
who said I'd need your consent?

436
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,383
I broke off with him, you hear?
Because I play straight.

437
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,129
Or did you think
I was after his money?

438
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,013
All I know is that he's ill.

439
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,590
It's not my fault.
I was honest with him.

440
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,160
And don't think
I'm not sorry for him.

441
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,489
I do. He's a lovely man.

442
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,708
But don't try to pin
his illness on me.

443
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,616
Blame yourselves!
Think he didn't tell me about you?

444
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,537
Shut up! I forbid you! You're even
a worse slut than I thought.

445
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,766
Stella!

446
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,353
Stella!

447
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,177
Stella!

448
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,180
Coming!

449
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,367
Stella! Here Stella!

450
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,933
Get in the back with us.

451
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:58,295
My mom's up front with Miltos,
cause she gets car sick all the time.

452
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,749
Yeah, come on let's go now!

453
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,361
Isn't my wife a doll?

454
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,438
Hello my dove!

455
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,343
Go to your mama now sweety, WilPya?

456
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,567
<i>Put me down, Mikes'.!</i>

457
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,984
Not until you tell me
you'll always be my girl!

458
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,150
- I don't know 'bout always.
- Then lie.

459
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,350
I don't lie to those I love myself.

460
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,232
Then say it for real.

461
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,947
You men are too free
with words.

462
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:39,005
Not me! Ask me anything,
and I'll risk my life.

463
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:44,638
Today, yes. I'd do as much for you,
and more. You hear? I'd do plenty!

464
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,921
Do you hear that, world?

465
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:52,172
It's Stella and she's my girl!
She is Mflto's girl!

466
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:39,923
<i>The moon is red
The river is blue</i>

467
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,648
<i>And my love in your arms
is a soft white bird</i>

468
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,471
<i>And my love in your arms
is a soft white bird</i>

469
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:59,481
<i>The moon is green
The river is deep</i>

470
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,484
<i>Come, my love,
dance all night long</i>

471
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:10,197
<i>Come, my love,
dance all night long</i>

472
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,940
<i>The moon dived into the river</i>

473
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,614
<i>And my love turned yellow
like a flame</i>

474
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:31,209
<i>Come, my love,
dance all night long</i>

475
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:35,661
<i>Come, my love,
dance all night long</i>

476
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,307
I never felt like this.

477
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,278
It's scary, like being scorched
by the sun.

478
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,352
Go on, sun.
Go on scorching us.

479
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,902
I don't like being tied
this way.

480
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,517
Thief! Bandit!

481
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,530
What are we headed for?

482
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,209
A tourney...

483
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,603
Switzerland...

484
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,186
A good psychiatrist...

485
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,054
Stella... forget...

486
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,393
Don't open!

487
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,483
Who can it be?

488
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,867
Stella.

489
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,697
Stella!

490
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,717
- Who is it?
- Alekos.

491
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,637
Tell him to go away.

492
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,290
He'll go by himself.

493
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,322
- You're mine now.
- Don't.

494
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,856
Why?

495
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,258
I don't know.
I'm sorry for him.

496
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,096
Stella!

497
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,563
He's gone.

498
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,405
Stella.

499
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,451
Stella.

500
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,473
Stella.

501
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,903
"For Life, For Love And Death That... "

502
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,341
They turned me away.
Why Miltos? It wasn't my fault.

503
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,438
- It wasn't my fault.
- No my heart, No my love.

504
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,518
- They sent me away.
- Stella, Don't cry.

505
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,701
They think I'm heartless,
that I killed him.

506
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,808
Let them try say that to my face.

507
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,482
You're Milto's girl.
You don't need anyone. Don't cry.

508
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,305
Listen Stella... I've made up my mind.
We're getting married.

509
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,937
Yes Stella, we'll marry.

510
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,698
And they'll be saying "That's Milto's
wife", and they'll respect you.

511
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,257
What's she doing?

512
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,368
She sits there
without saying a word.

513
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,199
- It's been a terrible shock for her.
- of course...

514
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,197
when she dumped him she wasn't thinking.

515
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,180
I told him, it would end this way.

516
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,987
Watch your words,
or there'll be hell to pay.

517
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,867
Hasn't Milto shown up?

518
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,255
Not yet.

519
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,852
Stella...

520
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,648
Maria, do come in. I have
something to tell you.

521
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,731
What is it Stella?

522
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,461
<i>Mike asked me to marry him.</i>

523
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,221
Really, my beuty!

524
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,973
He's like all the others.

525
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,611
<i>A posses“...
He wants to have me ties! down...</i>

526
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,634
And you?

527
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,708
I love him.

528
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,256
What did you tell him?

529
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,571
Nothing.

530
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,615
I said nothing.

531
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,244
Maria I can take it no more.

532
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,874
I can't breathe.
I want to sing, to feel alive!

533
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,334
I'm choking, do you hear?
Chocking, chocking, chocking!

534
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,502
<i>Love, you've become</i>

535
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,835
<i>A two-edged knife</i>

536
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:58,786
<i>Once you only gave me joy</i>

537
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:09,212
<i>Now you drown the joy in tears</i>

538
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:18,750
<i>I see no escape, no cure</i>

539
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:28,874
<i>Now you drown the joy in tears</i>

540
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:38,245
<i>I see no escape, no cure</i>

541
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,258
She said she wouldn't sing,
but she couldn't resist it.

542
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,004
The very day he was buried!

543
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:49,090
She leaves them all. And you Miltos.
Just you wait. It'll be your turn next!

544
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,142
I'm not like the others.
We're getting married.

545
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:56,459
- What did you say?
- We're getting married.

546
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,319
I just saw my mother.
We've set the date.

547
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:06,197
<i>Fires bum in his eyes</i>

548
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:15,196
<i>The stars tumble down
when he looks at me</i>

549
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,576
<i>Put out the lights</i>

550
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,525
<i>Put out the moon</i>

551
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:34,393
<i>Le! him no! see my pain
when he takes me.</i>

552
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,360
When?

553
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,262
October 28th. The national holiday.
It's a Sunday too.

554
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:55,088
<i>Le! him no! see my pain
when he takes me.</i>

555
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,665
<i>Why, Mike'! Why'?</i>

556
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,752
- I want to know you're mine.
- You know that.

557
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,059
I won't share you
with other men's eyes.

558
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,503
- Don't you trust me?
- I don't know.

559
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,437
That slays me.

560
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,916
Trust me and go away for years...
I'll be waiting. If you don't...

561
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,632
Don't you understand?

562
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,803
Being my girl
means nothing.

563
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,730
I want to say "my wife".
I want you say "my husband“.

564
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,259
Talking about "my girlfriend" or
“my boyfriend“ are double razors.

565
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,197
Brings to mind the talk of the knives.

566
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,971
Then you shouldn't have gotten
involved with me.

567
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:14,244
I hate the very thought of marriage!
I absolutely despise it!

568
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,769
I laugh at all women longing to secure
themselves, with a good marriage.

569
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,650
<i>1 don't wank you tube my husband
and me be your wife.</i>

570
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,627
Why can't we go on as we are?
Like wild animals.

571
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,279
Either you're all mine
or not at all.

572
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,047
I'll never marry you...
Nomatter what you say. Never!

573
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,871
Then I'm leaving, Stella.

574
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,527
We either get married as I say...

575
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,154
or I leave
and you never see me again.

576
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,476
I swear it
on my mother's life.

577
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,231
Why are you tormenting me?

578
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,907
I'm waiting, Stella.

579
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,860
Yes or no?

580
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,394
Why can't I say no'!

581
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,066
Why don't you just let me be!

582
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,395
Yes or no?

583
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,654
Why make me say something
I may regret later?

584
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:22,827
You won't regret it. It's heads or tails
and I put my whole life in the bet.

585
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,905
For the last time... Yes or no?

586
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,589
The wedding will take place
on the 28th.

587
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,432
I'll go tell the others.

588
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,661
- It's Milto, the soccer player!
- Getting married this afternoon!

589
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,621
<i>- We“ done Mike'.
- Congrats'.!</i>

590
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,376
- What time's the wedding?
- At 4:00.

591
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,215
What's her name?

592
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:26,721
- Is she pretty?
- What else, stupid!

593
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,303
Ok. There are tree more weddings
but we'll manage.

594
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,533
0k. Take me to the bride now.

595
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,526
- You'll wait outside.
- Yes, Mother.

596
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,979
You mustn't see her
before the ceremony. So, we said...

597
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,652
Watch your head in that wedding there!

598
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,198
What now?

599
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,614
Maria, the wedding bonbons!

600
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:54,508
- At last.
- Come on in.

601
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,907
Not now, children!

602
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,851
Out! Everybody out! Now!

603
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,048
- Where do we out this?
- Put it in a handchief.

604
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,640
- Try it on now, go ahead.
- Now it does fit you lovely.

605
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,893
- A little further back.
- It'll do.

606
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,843
Those bells drive me crazy.

607
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,891
- Did he have to pick today?
- It was his mother's idea.

608
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,719
As for her,
don't get me started!

609
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,627
His mother wants this,
his mother wants that...

610
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,025
For her son's happiness,
why shouldn't she?

611
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,130
I'm Milto's mother.

612
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,593
Please come in.

613
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:55,760
Thank you.

614
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,308
You must be Maria.

615
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,974
- And who are you?
- Anneta, a friend of Stella's.

616
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,940
- May to yours then.
- Thank you.

617
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,820
I thought I'd come meet the bride.

618
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,702
What would people say if we
first meet in the chapel.

619
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:12,105
I've been urging her to call on you.
Pay her respects.

620
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:16,506
That's as it should be.
Not the other way around.

621
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:22,671
My son's not bad,
but you're a shade too pretty for him.

622
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,753
You don't laugh?

623
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,865
Do I scare you?

624
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,093
- No.
- I thought not.

625
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,689
You have my blessing.

626
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:55,984
Should I ask why you didn't visit me,
or just let it go with the wind?

627
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,832
- Let it go.
- Deal.

628
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,736
My son came home one day
and said...

629
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,531
“Mother, I want to get married. "

630
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,501
"About time, " I said.
"Who is she?"

631
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:16,862
"A fine girl, " he said. "She's poor,
an orphan but beautiful and proud.

632
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,690
I had a hard time
talking her into it. "

633
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,536
Is that how it was?

634
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:24,430
Yes.

635
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:28,144
Good. Shows you weren't out
to hook him.

636
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:31,864
Hook him up? I've never tried
to hook anyone in my life.

637
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,225
You're a proud one, all right.
I like that.

638
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:41,070
Thank God we won't be living together.
We would be fighting all the time.

639
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:45,660
Each housewife rules her own
house, that's what I say.

640
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,859
Yesterday Miltos got
your own house too.

641
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,070
Our own house? Where?

642
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,337
Not too far from mine.

643
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,981
He had to borrow for it.

644
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:59,591
Why didn't he ask me?
He knows I like living around here.

645
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,348
- Where are you going?
- For a cigarette.

646
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,550
And why here in the neighbourhood?

647
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,910
Because I like
being near my work.

648
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:10,464
Listen my child... I'm from Crete
and I don't like mincing words.

649
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,626
Marriage changes a woman's life.

650
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:18,016
You'll have a Husband, a home,
some kids someday.

651
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:20,406
You'll have to forget about all this.

652
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:25,259
My son may have played up
his gentle side so far.

653
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,708
- He did not.
- Good.

654
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,771
Cause if he had he'd be a liar.

655
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,787
He's as stubborn as a mule.

656
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:39,701
Good boy yet strongheaded -he'd kill or
get killed in order to have his way.

657
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,119
Get me?

658
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:44,275
I 89¢ you.

659
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:45,841
Good.

660
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,303
Know why I told you
all this?

661
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:55,003
Because neither of you seems
cut out for half measures.

662
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,656
- Am I right?
- Right.

663
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:02,049
It's not for nothing
you have those big, hungry eyes.

664
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,094
I'll see you in church.

665
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,662
Don't be late.

666
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,009
- So that's Stella.
- What did you think of her?

667
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:27,325
For those two,
it'll be either heaven or flaming hell.

668
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,237
Let's go.

669
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,558
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

670
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:41,571
- Congratulations!
- Thanks! Hope you're next.

671
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,572
Fat chance, with that snout!

672
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,892
I saw another with
butterflies - unbelievable!

673
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,495
I'm going home.
I've got things to do.

674
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,080
- What things?
- That's my business.

675
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,293
- We agreed you'd get dressed here.
- I've changed my mind.

676
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:12,500
- Pick me up in the car.
- What about lunch?

677
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:16,916
She's marrying the best
and she's all nerves.

678
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,235
I wish it were me.

679
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:23,171
Come on. Let's see to the flowers.
It's almost noon.

680
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,660
Miss Maria sent me.

681
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,753
I've brought you something to eat.

682
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,571
Leave it there.

683
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,446
- You've been crying?
- A little.

684
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:27,257
Why?

685
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,286
Because of all the boys like you.

686
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,221
I don't understand.

687
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,428
Never mind.

688
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,646
- I've got to get going...
- Wait.

689
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,376
- What's your name?
- Antonis.

690
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,260
- How old are you?
- Nearly 20.

691
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,261
You don't say!
Every inch a man.

692
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,769
Let's have a smoke.

693
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:01,896
- I have here boy.
- Oh please... Please have one of mine.

694
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,939
Oh excuse me.

695
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,544
- Is that your wedding dress?
- Yes.

696
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,631
You'll be stunning in white.

697
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,103
You mea I'm not with this one?

698
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:29,004
You always are.
I've seen you often.

699
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,350
Why did you never speak to me?

700
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,731
I didn't dare.

701
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:38,457
Has any girl told you you've
got beautiful eyes? Fiery?

702
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,154
No.

703
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,522
Pm glad I'm the first.

704
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,292
Me too.

705
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,310
Aren't you scared
saying such things on my wedding day?

706
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,668
Scared of what?

707
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,030
Of my husband.
Do you know him'!

708
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:55,345
No, but he's very lucky.

709
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:59,371
- Are you coming to the wedding?
- Unfortunately not.

710
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,432
Mrs Maria invited me but
I must go to the parade.

711
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:06,098
I'm standard-bearer
for my college.

712
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:09,284
Pity I can't watch you.

713
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,368
What is there to see really?

714
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,001
I'm sorry, I have to...
Oh, thank you.

715
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,340
You 're going?

716
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,771
I have to.

717
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,604
Good-bye, Miss Stella.

718
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,816
Bye, Antoni.

719
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,980
I wish I were in his place.

720
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,765
Stella!

721
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,001
Stella!

722
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,041
Stella!

723
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,229
- The weather's getting worse.
- Stella!

724
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:26,514
Aren't you dressed yet?
What are you waiting for? Quick!

725
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,895
- I'm not going with you.
- What did you say?

726
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,270
I'm not getting married.

727
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,119
You can't!
Stella, you can't!

728
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:37,377
Says who?

729
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:40,158
I surely can run away from their prison.

730
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:41,486
Keep my freedom.

731
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,631
- Then why did you accept?
- Why you said yes?

732
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,136
I loved him.
He forced me.

733
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,105
You mean you don't love him anymore?

734
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:51,244
I mean What's the point... I'll dry up
inside the moment he locks me up.

735
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:52,617
Stella, you'll go!

736
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,700
You can't make a fool of him!
Dump him in front of everyone!

737
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:00,083
Better now, before the wedding,
than later.

738
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,668
- You know him. He'll kill you!
- Then let him!

739
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,098
I only wanted his love,
and I gave him all I had.

740
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:05,752
Liar!

741
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:09,054
Why do they all want to change me? One's
to make a lady of me, 0110's a housewife?

742
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,277
- Your darn pride!
- Why'! Show me one...

743
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:15,029
Name one who hasn't tried to
change me to fit his likings!

744
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:18,573
What the hell am I then eh?
A damn record player?

745
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:24,577
Better to be killed by him
than marry him against my will!

746
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:28,383
You selfish bitch! You snake!

747
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:31,296
If you think what I'm doing
doesn't hurt...

748
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,225
you're wrong.

749
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,129
- Stella!
- Let her go.

750
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,965
- Let her go to hell!
- What are we gonna tell the man now?

751
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,445
The truth! Everything!

752
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,943
- Make him see what a tramp she is!
- shutup, you jealous one.

753
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:43,514
No, I'm not jealous.
It's him I'm thinking about.

754
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:46,473
It's Milto I bleed for.
We should've dragged her by force.

755
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:51,253
Stop that hysteria. I'm sorry for
him too, but I take my hat off to her.

756
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,608
- For spitting on her luck?
- Do the same if you can.

757
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:57,496
- I've no luck to spit on.
- And you never will.

758
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:01,303
Stella has guts! She listens to her heart.
Nothing else counts.

759
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,113
Are you out of your head?
You'd do the same in her shoes?

760
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:08,085
No... I Wouldn't have the guts!
That's why I bow before her now.

761
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,811
For me, she's like a shot in the arm,
a good dream.

762
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:16,233
Stella's never stugnunt inside. She's
always fresh, always full of life...

763
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,386
like a field of flowers.

764
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,200
Let's go.

765
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,224
She's late.

766
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,648
The bride, where's the bride?
Coming'!

767
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,448
I couldn't believe my eyes!

768
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,579
I told you
I wanted to see you.

769
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,438
But... the wedding?

770
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,529
- Glad to see me?
- And how!

771
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,188
- Where are you going now?
- Nowhere particular.

772
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,327
How would you like to be
my escort tonight?

773
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:58,481
Oh, would I!

774
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,036
We'll have fun!
Today everyone has fun. Right?

775
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,346
Come on. Let's go.

776
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,867
I don't give a damn,
I tell youllfls all in the head.

777
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,983
I rule my heart! And not all the
Stellas in the world can break it!

778
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:24,299
Why are you staring at me?
Is something the matter?

779
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,720
I said, is something the matter?

780
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,396
Go on, play!

781
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:50,137
Play Billy. You're a friend.

782
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,278
Tonight we'll have a ball!

783
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,106
Mitso, little brother, come close!

784
01:19:56,240 --> 01:20:00,040
Whatever you say, Milto.
Anything for you man.

785
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,329
Okay, Stella.

786
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:17,746
Milto... Forget her.
She isn't worth thinking about.

787
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:22,801
You're right.
This is going to be quite a night!

788
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:28,526
She'll be here at some point - right?
We'll show her I don't give a damn!

789
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:34,645
<i>“Oh Mikes'.!</i>

790
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,905
I don't like the look of him.

791
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,782
Pray he leaves early,
in case Stella shows up.

792
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,649
<i>- Huh Nfitso'.
- Huh Mme'.!</i>

793
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,004
Miltos... The prettiest girls
are crazy about you!

794
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:55,900
Don't take it so hard!

795
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:59,635
Me? Hard? Why, can't you see
I'm laughing?

796
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,945
Think of all the people
laughing tonight.

797
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,968
They say Milto
was made a fool of...

798
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:06,957
that the bride ran out on him.

799
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,763
Let them laugh!

800
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,256
Tonight there']I be plenty of fun.

801
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,446
Stella?

802
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:10,673
What?

803
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,143
Shall I take you home?

804
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:16,132
No. To Maria's.

805
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,227
She's a friend.

806
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,323
Here we are.

807
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,332
- Shall I see you in?
- No.

808
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,932
I don't want to wake up Maria.

809
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,767
Go now. Quickly.

810
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:20,354
- And don't look back.
- Why?

811
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,649
It's bad luck.

812
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:28,594
Tomorrow?

813
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:32,006
- Tomorrow.
- Good-bye, Stella.

814
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,107
Good-bye, Antoni.

815
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,214
Stella, go away!

816
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:13,375
Go Stella, I'm going to kill you!

817
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,788
Didn't you hear me, Stella?
I've got a knife.

818
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:36,259
Say you're sorry. Say you'll marry me
and I'll drop the knife.

819
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,336
Stella,

820
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:45,788
Why don't you so?

821
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:47,929
Why?

822
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:04,573
Kiss me, Nlilto, kiss me.

823
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:05,994
Stella!

824
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:11,927
- My love!
- Kiss me!

825
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,064
Sss... me...

826
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,908
- kiss... me...
- Stella!

827
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:22,920
Stella!

828
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,853
Help! Murder!

829
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:53,486
Help! He]?!

830
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:00,136
- Stella!
- Stella!

831
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:11,186
What's going on?

832
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,976
<i>What have you done, NEW?
Why'! Why'!?</i>

833
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:17,834
Go away, all of you!

834
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:21,350
Leave her and go!
Milto!

835
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:25,553
It's all her fault!
Leave me! Leave her!

836
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:27,915
<i>Go Mike'. “ifs not a murderer'.!</i>

837
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:31,431
<i>He is not a murderer'.
Go, mm'. Go'.!</i>

838
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:38,208
It's all her fault!

839
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,929
Milto!

840
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,902
The police Milto,
they'll get you, please go...
