1
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,720
- Good night.
- Good night, Sir John.

2
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,360
Begging your pardon, sir.

3
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,720
We met on this selfsame road
the other day...

4
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,680
...and I said, "Good night," and
you replied, "Good night, Sir John."

5
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,640
I may have.

6
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,360
- Did so again today.
- So I did.

7
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,800
Why call me "Sir John" when I be
plain Jack Durbeyfield, the haggler?

8
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,880
Just a whim of mine.
I'm Parson Tringham by the way.

9
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,520
I made a discovery about you
while tracing some family trees...

10
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,280
...for our new county history.
I'm an antiquarian, you know.

11
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,480
You, Durbeyfield,
are directly descended...

12
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,000
...from the knightly house
of the d'Urbervilles.

13
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,960
- Did you really not know that?
- Never heard it before, sir.

14
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,640
Raise your head a little so that I can
see your face from the side.

15
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,800
Yes, that's the d'Urberville
nose and chin.

16
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,880
- A trifle coarser than of old, but still.
- Daze my eyes.

17
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,680
According to the records, your line
goes back to Sir Pagan d'Urberville...

18
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,240
...who came from Normandy
with William the Conqueror.

19
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,120
I've been slaving away
and living rough all these years?

20
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,440
Well, I thought you might already
know something about it.

21
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,000
It is true, I got an old silver spoon
at home and a graven seal...

22
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,520
...but I never paid them much heed.
Where do we d'Urbervilles live today?

23
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,200
You don't live anywhere.

24
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,640
You lie buried in your family vault
at Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill...

25
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,160
...laid out in lead coffins with your
effigies under marble canopies.

26
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,840
- And where be our family mansions?
- You haven't any.

27
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,160
No land neither?

28
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,800
None at all?

29
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,480
You had an abundance of land
in the old days.

30
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,280
What can I do about it, sir?

31
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,560
Well, as to that...

32
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,680
- Can I do nothing?
- Nothing whatever...

33
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,680
...save possibly chasten yourself
by thinking:

34
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,200
"How are the mighty fallen."

35
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,840
Good night...

36
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,840
...Sir John.

37
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,360
Won't you take a quart of beer
with me, sir?

38
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,440
There's a grand brew to be had
at The Pure Drop.

39
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,800
Though not so good as at Rolliver's.

40
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,800
Sir John d'Urberville.

41
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,840
That's who I am.

42
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,400
What is this?

43
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,640
- It is our club dance, sir.
- Club dance?

44
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,000
- But where are your partners?
- They've not finished work yet.

45
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,320
They'll be here by and by.

46
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,280
- Will you join us till then, sir?
- With pleasure...

47
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,800
...but one partner won't go far
among so many.

48
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,880
One's better than none.

49
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,880
It is sad work a-footing it
with no one to give you a squeeze.

50
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,440
Don't be so forward.

51
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,800
- What are you doing?
- I've a mind to enjoy myself. Come on.

52
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,560
You're full of nonsense.
Suppose someone sees us.

53
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,360
All right, go on. Don't wait for me.
I'll catch you up in five minutes.

54
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,160
Sir? Hey, hey, hey, sir?
Hey, sir?

55
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,720
Life has found me
a great gentleman.

56
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,320
- Noblest in the county!
- Lord, oh, Lord.

57
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,520
If it isn't your father
riding home in his cart.

58
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,280
There bain't be a man in the whole
of Wessex with finer skeletons than I!

59
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,680
Father's tired, that's all.

60
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,160
He sent for the cart
because our own horse died.

61
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,600
You know that very well.

62
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,520
Rows and rows
of knightly ancestors, I got.

63
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,680
Bain't be a man in the whole
of Wessex with finer skeletons than I.

64
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,600
I'm glad you've come.
Where are you off to?

65
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,400
I thought I'd change and help you.

66
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,920
You bide here. I want to tell you
what's happened.

67
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,120
We've been found to be the greatest
gentlefolk in the county...

68
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,680
...reaching back long before
Oliver Crumble's time...

69
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,400
...back to the days
of the pagan Turks.

70
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,080
With monuments and vaults...

71
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,560
...and crests and coats of arms,
and the Lord knows what all!

72
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,800
Is that why Father made such
a mommet of himself in that cart?

73
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,760
Our true name is d'Urberville.

74
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,560
That's why he came home in style,
not because he'd been drinking.

75
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,840
Where is he now?

76
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,880
It was a parson told him
the pedigree of the matter.

77
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,840
- But where is he now?
- Well, to tell you the truth...

78
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,080
...he was that upset, he's gone off
to Rolliver's to get up his strength.

79
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,880
Much strength he'll find
at the bottom of a pint pot.

80
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,480
Very well, I'll go and get him.
We'll be back afore you know it.

81
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,920
Now, look, be a good girl
and put the little ones to bed for me.

82
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,320
There it is.

83
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,200
That?

84
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,880
That spoon may be small,
but my family was great.

85
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,880
- Jack, I've got a project.
- We owned carriages, estates...

86
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,240
...and mansions without number.
- Listen to me.

87
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,760
Is there any money in it?

88
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,480
It is well to be kin to a coach,
even if you don't ride in one.

89
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,960
I've been thinking since
you brought me the news.

90
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,800
- I've got a project.
- Which reminds me, woman.

91
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,600
You better find that dang seal
of ours, or I'll do you a mischief.

92
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,760
Listen. There's a great lady
by the name of d'Urberville...

93
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,640
...living out by Trantridge.

94
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,000
Well, she's nothing compared
with us.

95
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,040
Younger branch of the family,
no doubt.

96
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,360
I'll wager they don't go back
to King Norman's day.

97
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,880
That's as may be, but she's rich.

98
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,240
Lot of good her money will do us.

99
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,520
It could do. We must send
our Tess to claim kin.

100
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,440
- Claim kin?
- Why shouldn't two branches...

101
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,160
...of the same family
be on visiting terms?

102
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,080
It would certainly put her
in the way of a grand marriage.

103
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,320
Then she ought to go there tomorrow.
Let's drink to that. Mrs. Rolliver!

104
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,680
There you are, my poppet.
We was just on our way.

105
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,360
But you're asking me to go begging.

106
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,040
Begging. What are you saying?

107
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,120
It is all in the family.

108
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,760
If they was in need, I should
take them in without a word.

109
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,560
We all have to take the ups
with the downs, Tess.

110
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,280
Now, you must go and see her...

111
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,200
...and ask her for some help
in our trouble.

112
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,960
If the lady received me at all, it
would be enough if she were friendly.

113
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,040
You must not expect her to help us.

114
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,520
Come, come, my dear.

115
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,360
With your pretty face,
you could coax her into anything.

116
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,240
I'd rather try to get work.

117
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,400
Durbeyfield, you decide.

118
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,200
If you say she must go, she'll go.

119
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,680
Well, girl, do you want to go visiting
this grand kinswoman of ours?

120
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,000
- I'd much sooner not, Father.
- There, she doesn't want to!

121
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,320
I don't like my children making
themselves beholden with strange kin.

122
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,160
I'm the head of the noblest branch
of the family...

123
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,400
...and I got my pride to think of.

124
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,600
All this bragging about your ancestors.

125
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,360
It isn't them as will buy us
a new horse.

126
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,200
It's all new.

127
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,920
Well, my beauty...

128
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,960
...what can I do for you?

129
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,120
- I came to see Mrs. D'Urberville.
- I'm afraid that's impossible.

130
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,840
She's an invalid.

131
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,120
What was your business with her?
I'm her son.

132
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,200
It wasn't business, it was...

133
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,840
I can hardly say what.

134
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,520
- Not business, sir, no.
- Pleasure, then?

135
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,800
No, sir.

136
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,960
It is so very foolish, I...

137
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,400
- I fear I can't tell you.
- Never mind.

138
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,600
I like foolish things.

139
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,400
Try again, dear.

140
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,000
I came, sir, to tell you that...

141
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,600
...we are of the same family as you.

142
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,440
Poor relations?

143
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,000
- Yes.
- Stokes?

144
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,480
No, d'Urbervilles.

145
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,080
Yes, yes, I meant d'Urbervilles.

146
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,120
Tell me...

147
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,600
...do you like strawberries?

148
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,080
- Yes, when they're in season.
- Here, they already are.

149
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,320
Our name has become Durbeyfield...

150
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,840
...but we have several proofs
that we're d'Urbervilles.

151
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,680
That's who the antiquarians
hold we are, so Mother said...

152
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,120
...we should make ourselves
beknown to you...

153
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,160
...as we've lost our horse...

154
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,600
...and we are the oldest branch
of the family.

155
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,560
I see.

156
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,360
So you've come to pay me
a courtesy call, really...

157
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,240
...as one relation to another.

158
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,640
- I suppose I have.
- Yes. Well, there's no harm in that.

159
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,280
I would rather take it
from my own hand.

160
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,920
Don't be so coy, my pretty cousin.

161
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,200
There.

162
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,640
Come, this one too.

163
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,640
It's the perfect place.

164
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,480
Believe me.

165
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,360
You'll look a regular posy!

166
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,120
- What's the matter?
- A thorn.

167
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,680
Cousin, beauty has its price.

168
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,760
I'm not very hungry. Truly, I'm not.

169
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,160
Nonsense.

170
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,760
You must eat something
before you go.

171
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,800
It's no mean ride
from here to your village.

172
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,720
I shall see what I can do for you.

173
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,800
But listen, Tess, no more
of this d'Urberville nonsense.

174
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,760
Plain Durbeyfield, understand?

175
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,040
It's quite a different name.

176
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,360
I wish for no better, sir.

177
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,600
"In reference to your daughter
and further to her visit...

178
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,000
...we write to inform you
of our willingness...

179
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,120
...to consider engaging her services...

180
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,960
...in the managing of a poultry farm
of modern character.

181
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,840
Lf, after a suitable period,
your daughter...

182
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,320
...proves satisfactory,
we should guarantee her...

183
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,240
...comfortable accommodation
and a good wage.

184
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,040
Your earliest reply would be
greatly appreciated."

185
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,200
So you charmed them after all,
did you?

186
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,680
Let me see that letter.

187
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,720
- Who wrote it?
- Who?

188
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,160
Mrs. D'Urberville, of course.
Look at the signature.

189
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,480
Me? Manage a poultry farm?

190
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,640
- I truly don't think I should go.
- Poultry.

191
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,120
It is just her way of getting you there
without raising your hopes too much.

192
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,080
She's going to own you as kin.

193
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,640
Hey! The seal!

194
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,440
This is it!

195
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,640
It's the same as ours.
Look at it, lad.

196
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,120
A ramping, great, big lion
with a castle on top.

197
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,040
There's no denying it, girl.

198
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,480
Mrs. D'Urberville recognized
her own flesh and blood.

199
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,480
But she never even saw me.

200
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,920
Well, you couldn't expect her to throw
her arms round your neck...

201
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,040
...her being an invalid.

202
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,400
But her son made you welcome.
He called you "cousin," didn't he?

203
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,760
I'd rather bide here with you.

204
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,120
Goodbye, Father.

205
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,760
- You're off, then?
- Yes. Goodbye, Father.

206
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,880
Goodbye, girl.

207
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,800
You're a comely sight.

208
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,640
This young cousin of yours...

209
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,600
...tell him that, being so come down
in the world...

210
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,920
...l'll sell him the title.

211
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,240
Yes, I'll sell it, but a fair price.

212
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,760
Not less than
a thousand pounds, mind.

213
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,400
That's right, tell him
I'll take a thousand pounds.

214
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,520
Well, now I come to think on it...

215
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,640
...he can have it for a hundred.
I won't stand on trifles.

216
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,080
Fifty.

217
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,600
Twenty pounds, tell him,
and not a penny less.

218
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,240
- Family honor is family honor.
- Come, it's time to go.

219
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,280
I want to walk a little ways
with Tess.

220
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,960
So do I, now she's leaving
to marry our gentleman cousin.

221
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,800
I'll hear no more of that.

222
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,880
Mother, how could you have put
such nonsense into their heads?

223
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,680
She's going to work for a rich relation,
my dears...

224
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,600
...and help us earn enough money
to get a new horse.

225
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,440
Oh, Mother, I wish our Tess
hadn't gone to be a lady.

226
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,320
Don't hold my arm!
Grab me round the waist!

227
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,800
Ungrateful little minx. Why abandon
me as soon as you feel safe?

228
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,040
The danger came of your foolishness.

229
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,520
I say, what a temper.

230
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,440
When people are on top of a hill,
they have to get down somehow.

231
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,320
But not at a gallop, surely.

232
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,880
Fancy being asked that
by a brave little beauty like you.

233
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,640
I always go downhill at a gallop.

234
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,880
You can't beat it
for stirring the blood.

235
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,720
But perhaps you needn't
do so again.

236
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,600
Perhaps not.

237
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,440
It all depends.

238
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,840
One little kiss on those ruby lips
or even on that satin cheek...

239
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,360
...and I drive at a snail's pace,
word of honor.

240
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,200
But I don't want to be kissed, sir.

241
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,600
Stop, stop, I beg you!

242
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,440
Very well, do as you wish.
I don't mind.

243
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,440
But I thought you'd protect me,
being a kinsman.

244
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,280
Kinsman be hanged.

245
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,720
You're mighty sensitive
for a village lass.

246
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,280
- Oh, my hat!
- Whoa, boy.

247
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,120
You look even prettier without it!

248
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,400
- Come along, now. Up you get.
- No, sir.

249
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,760
- You won't ride with me?
- No, I shall walk.

250
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,280
It's four miles to Trantridge, at least.

251
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,640
I wouldn't care if it were 20.

252
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,080
You watch out for Dollop, the bailiff.
He's a devil.

253
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,320
Not Mr. Alec. Spends half
his time on horseback...

254
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,040
...and the rest of it chasing
the likes of us.

255
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,240
His mother's a queer old soul,
but no real trouble.

256
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,800
It is a mercy for us she's blind.

257
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,160
- Mrs. D'Urberville's blind?
- Stone-blind.

258
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,360
Their real name is Stoke.

259
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,960
How's that?

260
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,000
It were Mr. Alec's father
had the notion.

261
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,680
He bought the name
of an old extinguished family...

262
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,160
...to make himself important.

263
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,080
Whatever are you doing?
Missus is waiting for her birds.

264
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,120
Quick, it slipped my mind entirely.

265
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,880
Now, you catch hold
of Phena there...

266
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,720
...and that one.

267
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,120
That one there and the white one.

268
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,960
So you are the new young woman.

269
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,520
Well, how are my birds?

270
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,920
This is Strut.

271
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,720
He doesn't seem so lively today,
does he?

272
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,160
He's alarmed at being handled
by a stranger, I suppose.

273
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,640
And Phena?

274
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,640
Yes, yes.

275
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,440
They are a little frightened.
Aren't you, my poor dears?

276
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,280
Never mind.

277
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
They'll soon get used to you.

278
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,360
Can you whistle?

279
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,440
Whistle, ma'am?

280
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,040
Yes, whistle tunes.

281
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,640
A little.

282
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,960
Then you will have to practice
every day.

283
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,880
I think a lot of my fowls, but there are
also my bullfinches to consider.

284
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,680
I had a young lad who whistled
to them very well, but he left.

285
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,400
They've been neglected for days.

286
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,000
Master Alec whistled to them
this morning, ma'am.

287
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,440
Him.

288
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,120
Nor art nor nature ever created
a lovelier thing than you, Cousin Tess.

289
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,040
To see that pretty mouth
pouting and puffing away...

290
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,080
...without producing a single note.

291
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,840
- It is all a part of my work, sir.
- Never mind. I'll teach you.

292
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,520
I won't lay a finger on you.
See? I'll stay exactly where I am.

293
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,200
Now you watch me.

294
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,840
Don't screw up your lips too tight.

295
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,800
Do it like this.

296
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,520
Blow gently.

297
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,960
Gently.

298
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,360
Try.

299
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,080
No, no. Try again.

300
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,880
Again.

301
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:18,400
There. You'll manage splendidly
now I've started you off.

302
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,560
Tell me, Tess, don't you find
my mother a little odd?

303
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,520
I hardly know her, sir.

304
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,000
Well, I'm not in her good books
at the moment.

305
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,400
But you should find favor
if you treat her livestock well.

306
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,680
If you meet with any difficulties...

307
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,400
...don't go to Dollop...

308
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,160
...come to me.

309
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,080
What? Don't you fancy
a dance, then?

310
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,200
I'm mortal tired.

311
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,040
- When are you all going home?
- Soon enough, soon enough.

312
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,520
Well, my beauty.

313
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,680
What are you doing here
this time of night?

314
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,520
I'm waiting for the others, sir...

315
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,840
...not being acquainted
with the road home.

316
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,360
I only have a saddle horse.
Come to the inn with me.

317
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,120
I'll hire a trap for us both.

318
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,120
No, no. Thank you,
but I promised to wait for them.

319
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:39,400
Very well. Silly girl.
Please yourself.

320
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,480
What's that creeping
down your back?

321
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,400
Well, I declare!

322
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,360
It is treacle!

323
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,000
- You dare laugh at me, you hussy.
- I can't help it.

324
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,920
No more than the others.

325
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,640
You think you're the queen
of Trantridge...

326
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,480
...just because you're first favorite
with him.

327
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,640
She never said anything.
Leave her.

328
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,320
I'll show you. I'm worth two of your
sort for all your airs and graces.

329
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,200
If I'd known what sort you were...

330
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,400
...l'd never have lowered myself
by accepting your company.

331
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,560
- I'll show you.
- Hey there, workfolk.

332
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,720
What's all the row about?

333
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,560
Quickly, jump up beside me.

334
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,320
Out of the frying pan, into the fire.

335
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,560
- Where are we?
- Passing through The Chase.

336
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,320
The Chase?

337
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,800
It is out of our way, surely.

338
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,680
This forest is one of the oldest
and loveliest in England, Tess.

339
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,760
Don't you think it deserves
to be seen...

340
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,160
...on a glorious God-given
night like this?

341
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,640
Yes, but...

342
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,360
No buts. There's a good girl.

343
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,360
I'll be honest with you.
I'm happy.

344
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm trying to prolong the moment.

345
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,600
You were shivering a while back.

346
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,320
Now I can feel your warmth
against me.

347
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,320
- Are you still cold?
- No, not now.

348
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,880
I'll let my animal
walk a little further.

349
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,440
He'll make better progress
once he's rested.

350
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,880
Tell me...

351
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,480
...what news of your parents' horse?
- They have no horse.

352
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,160
They have since Monday last.

353
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,920
- Did you...?
- Forgive me for mentioning it.

354
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,080
I thought they would have
written to you.

355
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,760
- I don't know what to say.
- It's nothing.

356
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,800
I knew how important it was
for your father to have a new horse.

357
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,560
Really.

358
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,560
It's you he should thank.

359
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,520
I'm grateful to you.

360
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,000
Truly I am.

361
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,240
But I almost wish
you hadn't done this.

362
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,280
Yes, I almost do.

363
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,440
- Is that a reproach?
- Oh, no.

364
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,120
It is very kind of you, I'm sure.

365
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,880
I've been in torment
ever since you came to us.

366
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,360
- Then I'll leave tomorrow, sir.
- That's absurd.

367
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,240
I don't want you to leave.

368
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,880
That's the last thing I want.

369
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,920
Is there no hope for me?

370
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,320
None at all?

371
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,360
Tess.

372
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,240
I'm dying for you.

373
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,120
Can't you see?

374
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,600
Forgive me.

375
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,680
Oh, please forgive me.

376
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,040
- Are you hurt?
- No, it's nothing. Nothing.

377
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,200
You're bleeding.

378
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,680
Oh, my God.

379
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,720
How ever could I have
done such a thing?

380
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,400
It's me.

381
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,480
Don't be so foolish.
Open the door.

382
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,320
You'll force me
to make a noise, Tess.

383
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,440
My mother has sharp ears.
She'll hear.

384
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,720
Enough of this nonsense, darling.
Open up.

385
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,920
Why sneak away...

386
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,840
...like a thief?

387
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,400
And at this hour in the morning?

388
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,120
Nobody would've prevented
you leaving.

389
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,240
At least let me drive you home.

390
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,600
Unless you'd care to come back.

391
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,600
I shan't come back.

392
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:08,360
- What are you crying for?
- I was only thinking...

393
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,000
...I was born over there.

394
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,120
Well, we all have
to be born somewhere.

395
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,520
L... I wish I'd never been born.

396
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:23,920
- There or anywhere else.
- You're absurdly melancholy, Tess.

397
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,560
You can hold your own for beauty
against any woman.

398
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,160
Queen or commoner.

399
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,640
I tell you that as a practical man
who wishes you well.

400
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,360
If you're wise, you'll let the world
get a clearer sight of that beauty...

401
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,120
...before it fades.

402
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,800
Why not make the most of life?

403
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,200
We didn't fare so badly
together, did we?

404
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:48,040
- I was blinded for a while, that's all.
- That's what all women say.

405
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,720
How dare you talk like that?

406
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,040
Has it never struck you what all
women say, some women may feel?

407
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,000
- All right. I was wrong, I admit it.
- Please, please stop.

408
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,440
I should like to get down here.

409
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,400
I'm a bad lot, I suppose.
A damn bad lot.

410
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,840
I was born bad,
and I warrant I'll die bad.

411
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,080
Listen, Tess...

412
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,360
...if circumstances should arise,
do you understand?

413
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,120
If you're ever in the least trouble,
the least difficulty...

414
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,760
...just send me one line, and you shall
have whatever you need by return.

415
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,280
You really won't come back?

416
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,360
Goodbye, my four months' cousin.

417
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,840
Goodbye.

418
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,600
Tess?

419
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,720
It is no use her pretending
she hates it...

420
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,320
...and wishes it in the churchyard
and herself beside it.

421
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,080
She loves that child of hers.

422
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,160
Poor little mite.
It don't look long for this world.

423
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,680
Good evening, Durbeyfield.

424
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,880
- What's your business?
- My business?

425
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,320
The child. I must baptize it before
the Lord gathers it to his bosom.

426
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,040
What child are you speaking of?

427
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,440
All my children are baptized.
You ought to know.

428
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,960
Durbeyfield, don't play games
with the Almighty.

429
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,600
I don't play, sir, I work!

430
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,160
I work! Like a beast of the field.

431
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,040
You can tell the Almighty that
from me.

432
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,440
- My baby's dying.
- You ought to have been more careful.

433
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,440
Like it or not, Jack,
that child was born.

434
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,360
It is here, under your own roof.

435
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,400
- Not true.
- Father, come to your senses.

436
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,200
For pity's sake, let the vicar in!

437
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,280
He shan't set foot inside this house.

438
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,040
Not over my dead body!

439
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,520
There's enough disgrace
on my name as it is.

440
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,520
O merciful God, take pity.

441
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,760
Take pity on him.

442
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,560
Send down your anger on me.

443
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,200
But have mercy on my child.

444
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,280
My child.

445
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,360
I should like to ask you
something, sir.

446
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,400
Well, speak, girl. I'm listening.

447
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,480
Each of us shares
in your sad affliction, my child.

448
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,440
We're all members
of the suffering body of Christ.

449
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,400
My son was baptized.

450
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:11,480
Baptized? By whom?

451
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,440
By me, last night.

452
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,800
What procedure did you follow?

453
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,200
I woke my little brothers
and sisters...

454
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,800
...and made them
kneel down to pray.

455
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,760
'Liza-Lu held the prayer book open.

456
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,400
I lit a candle.

457
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,400
And then?

458
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:39,680
Then I held my child like this
over the basin.

459
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,080
Yes.

460
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,040
I poured some water on his forehead,
and I said:

461
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,720
"I baptize thee...

462
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,720
...in the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost."

463
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,760
- Did you make the sign of the cross?
- Yes, I did that too.

464
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,320
Will it be just the same
as if you'd baptized him?

465
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,000
In the sight of God, I mean.

466
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,720
Yes, my dear girl.
It will be the same.

467
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,800
Then you'll give him
a Christian burial?

468
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,280
That's another matter.

469
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,640
Another matter? Why?

470
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,000
Well, that would concern
the village as a whole.

471
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,960
Not just the two of us,
you understand.

472
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,480
Won't you do it, sir?

473
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,880
Just this once?

474
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,600
I'm sorry.

475
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,600
I beg you, please.

476
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,720
I told you.
It's out of the question.

477
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,200
Then I don't like you.

478
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,680
I shall never come
to your church again.

479
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,120
Never.

480
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,560
Never!

481
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,800
- Hey, Mr. Crick.
- Eh?

482
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:19,880
What, here already?
We didn't expect you afore tomorrow.

483
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,240
It is quite a step from here
to Weatherbury.

484
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,760
- Marlott, sir. I come from Marlott.
- Yes, Marlott.

485
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,040
Well, that's even further.

486
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,120
Quite sure you can stand it here?

487
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,280
It is comfortable enough
for rough folk...

488
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,720
...but we don't live
in a cowcumber frame.

489
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,840
I'm accustomed to that.

490
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,360
I used to know your part
of the county when I were a lad.

491
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,880
Good. Right you are.

492
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,360
Well, you'll want a rest
and a morsel of food.

493
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,200
I'd rather begin now,
to get my hand in.

494
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,960
Oh, come on.
You must be famished.

495
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,480
No, thank you.
A little milk will suffice.

496
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,760
Well, if you can swallow that,
so be it.

497
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,000
It is what I hain't touched for years.

498
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,400
It lies in my innards like lead.

499
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,080
To my thinking, the beasts
aren't giving all they should.

500
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,720
That's because there's
a new hand come amongst us.

501
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,520
I've known it happen afore.

502
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:37,120
They do say that the milk goes up
into their horns at such times.

503
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,000
Anyone would think we were
back in the Middle Ages.

504
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,240
I don't appear to be making
much progress.

505
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,200
Take it gentle, sir. Take it gentle.
Whoa, now.

506
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:54,680
- It is skill that does it, not strength.
- So my aching fingers tell me.

507
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,520
Mrs. Crick's too proud to come
milking with us, and that's a fact.

508
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,880
Still, there's little enough
to wherrit about.

509
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,720
And we do eat like gamecocks.

510
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,480
No, you'll like it here.

511
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,000
Mr. Crick, he's a very kindly man.

512
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:33,360
Just fancy. He has his own
family pew in church.

513
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:40,080
Dairyman Dick all the week
On Sundays, Mr. Richard Crick

514
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,080
Who's that playing?

515
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,160
Mr. Clare.

516
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,280
Mr. Clare.

517
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,160
Him that's learning to milk.

518
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,080
Angel Clare, he's called.

519
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,720
Angel.

520
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,600
It is no common name.

521
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:31,080
He never says much to us,
more's the pity.

522
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,040
Why?

523
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,000
Does he scorn common folk?

524
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:42,120
Quite the opposite.
He often makes mock of old families.

525
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,080
It is quite simple.

526
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:50,880
He's a parson's son
with a mind to be a farmer.

527
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:56,480
He's already tried his hand
at sheep farming.

528
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,480
Now he's learning dairy work
with Mr. Crick.

529
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,680
But what does he hold against
old families?

530
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,720
He says they're...

531
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,160
...worm-eaten.

532
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,560
That be your soul trying to escape.

533
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,520
It is bread, that's all.

534
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:24,760
No, it is when you sneeze,
you're like to blow your soul away.

535
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,920
As I see it, no soul can leave
its mortal shell afore a body dies.

536
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,040
What if a man falls down
in a faint, Master Crick?

537
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,320
Well, that's a different matter.

538
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:41,320
The spirit bides there inside you,
but you cannot feel it.

539
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:46,760
But we can sometimes make
our souls leave our bodies.

540
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,560
How's that, then, maidy?

541
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,400
Only have to lie
on the grass at night...

542
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,760
...and look straight up
at some bright star.

543
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:03,600
And stare at it with all your might.

544
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,280
And by and by, you'll feel
you're falling into the sky...

545
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,360
...miles and miles from your body...

546
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,720
...which you'll don't seem
to need at all.

547
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,680
Tess!

548
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,720
Why run away like that?

549
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:18,520
- Are you afraid?
- No, sir. Not of outdoor things. No.

550
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,240
- But you have your indoor fears, eh?
- Heavens, yes.

551
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,200
Of what?

552
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:26,920
I couldn't rightly say.

553
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,520
Of the milk turning sour?

554
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:30,960
No.

555
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,800
Fear of life, in general?

556
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,240
Yes, sir.

557
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,040
So have I. Very often.

558
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,120
Life's a puzzle. Don't you think?

559
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,120
Perhaps...

560
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,920
...now you put it that way.

561
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:04,280
It is no use. It won't take.

562
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:09,880
If this continues, I shall have
to call on Conjurer Trendle.

563
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I don't say I believe in him, mind.

564
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:15,080
But if nothing else works,
I shall have to try it, shan't I?

565
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,800
Somebody here's in love, I'll be bound.
That can cause it, so I've heard.

566
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:22,280
Conjurer Fall,
to the side of Casterbridge.

567
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,160
He had the knack of it
when I was a lad.

568
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,400
It is a pity. He must be feeding
the worms by now.

569
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,960
My grandpa used to go to Conjurer
Mynterne out at Owlscombe.

570
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,040
But there's no folk
like him these days.

571
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,960
Somebody's in love, I tell you.

572
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:42,720
- What's the matter?
- The blasted butter won't come.

573
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,280
- Why is that?
- To my mind...

574
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,560
How warm it is today.

575
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,520
I think I'd be better out-of-doors.

576
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:55,240
They do say it happens
when people are in love.

577
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,760
I remember as a girl...

578
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,960
Don't push.

579
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,800
He looks so sad.

580
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:36,000
Whatever can he be thinking of?

581
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:39,400
Well, not of us.
You can rely on that.

582
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,920
You're a fine one to talk, lzz.

583
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,560
- I saw you.
- What did you see?

584
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,920
It was the other day.

585
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:56,280
I saw you kissing his shadow.

586
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,200
Here he comes again.

587
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,960
Dear eyes...

588
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,120
Dear face...

589
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,640
Dear Mr. Clare.

590
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,120
It is terrible to think he'll never wed
any one of us.

591
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:28,040
More likely, he'll ask us to milk
his cows for so much a year.

592
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,360
What are we going to do?

593
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,560
We shall have to take
the stone-bridge road.

594
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,360
We'll be late.

595
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:26,680
- Doesn't he go to church?
- No, never.

596
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,440
I wish he would.

597
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,320
You look like cats afraid of water.

598
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,200
Only on account
of our Sunday best, sir.

599
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,960
Very well. I'll carry you
just as you are.

600
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,520
No, no, I'm far too heavy.

601
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,080
Nonsense. I could carry
all four of you at once.

602
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,720
Hold on to me. That's it.

603
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:05,360
I should put my arms around
his neck and look into his eyes.

604
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,760
There's nothing in that.

605
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,080
There's a time for everything
under heaven.

606
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,240
A time to kiss and a time to cuddle.

607
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,520
Shame on you, lzz.
That's scripture.

608
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:18,800
I always heed the prettiest
verses in church.

609
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,880
If you helped me, perhaps I could
climb along the bank.

610
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,120
Tess.

611
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:18,720
I've gone to three-quarters of this
trouble for your sake alone.

612
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:56,840
She's angry. She doesn't understand.
She'll kick over the bucket.

613
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,280
Forgive me, my darling Tess.
I don't know what came over me.

614
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,120
There's only one excuse for it.

615
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,400
I love you.

616
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:10,720
Yes, I love you.

617
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,960
Angel?

618
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,240
Angel.

619
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,920
Hello, Mercy. Forgive me.
I didn't see you.

620
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,960
Forgive me.

621
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,520
Welcome home.

622
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,400
- How are you?
- Very well.

623
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,480
God be praised. You look radiant
with health, I see.

624
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,480
The open air, probably.

625
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,640
Have you come to spend
the holidays with your brothers?

626
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,080
Are they here? I had no idea.

627
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:55,080
No, I'm only paying my parents a brief
visit to settle some urgent business.

628
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,800
Then I won't detain you.

629
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,680
I have my Bible class
to take, in any case.

630
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,560
Au revoir, Angel.

631
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,160
- Angel!
- Angel! My boy.

632
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,480
I apologize, Father. I had no time
to warn you of my arrival.

633
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,520
Perhaps you've forgotten how
to write. With a pen, remember?

634
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,480
I brought you farmhouse delicacies.

635
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,400
Black puddings
and a bottle of mead.

636
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,600
Black puddings?

637
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:44,360
It's true your mother and I
have regretted...

638
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,600
...hearing so little of your news.

639
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,200
You must bear with him, Father.

640
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:50,600
Spending all his time
with sheep and cattle...

641
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:54,240
...takes one closer to nature
but further from Oxford.

642
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,840
I would remind you, Felix...

643
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,440
...that a university education
means nothing...

644
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,720
...unless it redounds
to the glory of God.

645
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,160
It can also redound
to the glory of man.

646
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,440
Only in the second place.

647
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,280
How far are you
in your apprenticeship?

648
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,960
It's drawing to a close.

649
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,840
What counts is spiritual cleanliness.
Isn't that so, Father?

650
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,280
The two go together, my boy.

651
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,760
Father tells us you intend
setting up on your own.

652
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,160
Yes.

653
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,520
- In what part of the world?
- I don't know yet.

654
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,600
The colonies perhaps.

655
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,200
Heaven preserve us.

656
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,800
It would suit the type of
farming I have in mind.

657
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,680
- What colony?
- The choice is wide.

658
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,600
Or I may settle in a foreign country.

659
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,080
Some places offer land to immigrants
on very favorable terms.

660
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,280
Brazil, for example.

661
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,920
Wonders will never cease.

662
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,120
Nothing's settled yet.
I came here to discuss it.

663
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,040
That among other things.

664
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:54,200
Shall we take a drop of good
Mrs. Crick's delicious mead?

665
01:10:56,876 --> 01:10:58,207
Oh forgive me . I forgot.

666
01:10:58,778 --> 01:11:00,541
Strong drink is the root of all evil.

667
01:11:10,856 --> 01:11:11,948
Take us into your confidence.

668
01:11:12,525 --> 01:11:13,549
Is it something serious?

669
01:11:14,327 --> 01:11:18,058
Not serious, but something
important. The truth is

670
01:11:20,066 --> 01:11:22,091
son't you think it's time
i considered marrying?

671
01:11:22,902 --> 01:11:24,870
Yes indeed my boy, yes indeed.

672
01:11:25,171 --> 01:11:27,298
Your mother and I have sometimes
debated the same question.

673
01:11:27,573 --> 01:11:28,267
Really?

674
01:11:28,674 --> 01:11:29,698
And what sort of wife would you favour

675
01:11:30,109 --> 01:11:31,838
for a budding farmer like myself?

676
01:11:32,144 --> 01:11:34,009
Truly christian, god-fearing woman.

677
01:11:34,313 --> 01:11:37,282
One who will be of help and
a comfort to you in all things.

678
01:11:37,783 --> 01:11:38,841
The rest matters little.

679
01:11:39,085 --> 01:11:40,712
You musn't hesitate, dear son.

680
01:11:41,854 --> 01:11:42,582
Why hesitate?

681
01:11:43,122 --> 01:11:45,750
To marry your heart's desire.
Mercy Chant.

682
01:11:47,226 --> 01:11:50,389
She may be fond of over-
decorating the church and

683
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:53,424
flipparies and flowers,
scraps of lacys and so forth but

684
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,300
It's merely a girl's fancies. It will pass.

685
01:11:57,036 --> 01:11:58,901
Mercy's a pure and virtuous girl.

686
01:11:59,171 --> 01:12:01,139
Oh yes I know she's pure and virtuous.

687
01:12:02,475 --> 01:12:05,808
But honesty compels me to
inform you that I have other plans.

688
01:12:06,879 --> 01:12:07,504
Other plans?

689
01:12:07,747 --> 01:12:08,543
Very much sir.

690
01:12:09,048 --> 01:12:11,278
Mercy Chant appeals more
to you than she does to me.

691
01:12:11,784 --> 01:12:15,117
I'm not disputing her merits
I'm only speaking of my own inclinations.

692
01:12:15,421 --> 01:12:16,319
My dearest boy.

693
01:12:16,822 --> 01:12:20,019
Angel.Please remember that
you are addressing your parents.

694
01:12:20,259 --> 01:12:20,987
I'm aware of that.

695
01:12:22,495 --> 01:12:24,463
I already know the woman I intend to marry.

696
01:12:25,331 --> 01:12:27,356
Her name is Teresa Durbeyfield.

697
01:12:30,569 --> 01:12:33,129
Father, Mother. I respect you both.

698
01:12:34,006 --> 01:12:36,474
I also respect Mercy Chant.
And have no doubt

699
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:38,404
she'll find worthier husband with or

700
01:12:38,611 --> 01:12:43,674
without your help. As for me,
my mind is made up.

701
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:21,782
Oh it's you...

702
01:13:22,021 --> 01:13:24,421
Tess, I want to ask you this now.

703
01:13:27,326 --> 01:13:28,122
Will you be my wife?

704
01:13:30,262 --> 01:13:32,321
I love you with all my heart and soul.

705
01:13:41,674 --> 01:13:43,642
I can not be your wife.

706
01:13:45,311 --> 01:13:46,073
Don't you love me?

707
01:13:46,745 --> 01:13:48,110
Oh yes yes...

708
01:13:49,115 --> 01:13:52,050
I'd rather belong to you
than anyone in the world.

709
01:13:53,219 --> 01:13:58,714
Forgive me. I can't marry you.

710
01:14:31,790 --> 01:14:35,191
It was the good lord who put
this nice young person's in your way.

711
01:14:35,461 --> 01:14:36,553
You must believe that.

712
01:14:37,129 --> 01:14:41,156
But with respects to your question,
I tell you quite private but

713
01:14:41,367 --> 01:14:45,667
very strong. On no accounts,
say a word about your bygone trouble.

714
01:14:46,338 --> 01:14:49,569
Never a word, my girl. Least of all to him.

715
01:14:57,716 --> 01:15:00,844
Tess. Why does the idea of
becoming my wife displease you?

716
01:15:00,986 --> 01:15:05,116
I never said that. It would please me so much.

717
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:09,457
It's simply that I can not.

718
01:15:09,628 --> 01:15:12,597
Why? Is there someone else?

719
01:15:16,001 --> 01:15:17,434
Don't i deserve to know the truth?

720
01:15:19,538 --> 01:15:20,197
Well?

721
01:15:21,006 --> 01:15:21,734
Not now

722
01:15:22,241 --> 01:15:22,935
When then?

723
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:24,137
Later.

724
01:15:24,343 --> 01:15:25,002
But why?

725
01:15:28,347 --> 01:15:30,110
I'll tell you when we get home.

726
01:15:31,183 --> 01:15:33,174
You'll stop loving
me when you know.

727
01:15:35,154 --> 01:15:36,917
Let me wait till then.

728
01:16:05,251 --> 01:16:07,981
Londoners will drink it at
their breakfast tomorrow, won't they?

729
01:16:08,153 --> 01:16:10,485
Yes but watered down,
in case it goes to their heads.

730
01:16:10,923 --> 01:16:12,857
Strangers that we have never seen.

731
01:16:24,436 --> 01:16:26,165
You saw me once before.
you know that?

732
01:16:26,772 --> 01:16:27,295
I did?

733
01:16:28,173 --> 01:16:29,800
You wouldn't dance with me.

734
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:32,042
It was at Marlott.

735
01:16:32,544 --> 01:16:33,306
Of course!

736
01:16:35,347 --> 01:16:36,575
That's incredible!

737
01:16:36,749 --> 01:16:37,545
You remember now?

738
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:39,417
Tessy!Tessy!

739
01:16:43,222 --> 01:16:43,984
Now my girl.

740
01:16:44,623 --> 01:16:49,959
Yes. I may never again be
brave enough to tell my story.

741
01:16:50,229 --> 01:16:51,753
Then get on with your precious story.

742
01:16:52,364 --> 01:16:54,730
I was born at such and such place
and in such and such a year...

743
01:16:54,967 --> 01:16:58,767
I was born at Marlott and i grew up there.

744
01:17:00,205 --> 01:17:02,673
I was in the Sixth Form when I left school.

745
01:17:03,876 --> 01:17:05,605
They said that I would make a geed teacher.

746
01:17:08,947 --> 01:17:10,539
But there was trouble in my family.

747
01:17:12,751 --> 01:17:15,345
Father was no great worker.

748
01:17:16,622 --> 01:17:21,252
He drank. Anyway, my parents, they...

749
01:17:23,195 --> 01:17:25,254
it was then that something happened.

750
01:17:26,732 --> 01:17:29,132
Something which changed my life like.

751
01:17:33,372 --> 01:17:39,834
They discovered
that we were not Durbeyfields

752
01:17:40,379 --> 01:17:41,505
but D'Urbervilles.

753
01:17:43,315 --> 01:17:44,441
WEll, go on.

754
01:17:46,385 --> 01:17:47,317
WEll, that's it.

755
01:17:48,721 --> 01:17:52,748
WEll the D'Urbervilles are an old family.

756
01:17:53,926 --> 01:17:54,551
I know

757
01:17:58,330 --> 01:18:03,632
On account of being of that
name my mother thought that...

758
01:18:06,905 --> 01:18:08,099
I was sent...

759
01:18:12,911 --> 01:18:15,004
-I had a...
-A what?

760
01:18:16,248 --> 01:18:17,909
I was told that you hated old families.

761
01:18:20,386 --> 01:18:21,318
Is that all the trouble?

762
01:18:23,188 --> 01:18:26,589
None of that matters, Tess. Say you'll be my wife.

763
01:18:27,526 --> 01:18:30,620
Say it, Tess. SAy it, my dear love!

764
01:18:32,898 --> 01:18:35,423
Yes yes yes...

765
01:18:44,276 --> 01:18:46,710
my health, my simplicity.

766
01:18:47,813 --> 01:18:50,111
I'm a strangeness of my situation.

767
01:18:50,849 --> 01:18:52,510
I perhaps lessen my fault.

768
01:18:57,389 --> 01:19:00,847
But since I've committed it I am guilty.

769
01:19:05,364 --> 01:19:06,524
I must be guilty.

770
01:19:07,499 --> 01:19:10,297
Because the lord sawfit to take my child.

771
01:19:13,172 --> 01:19:18,109
If what I have just written,
failed to pass my lips,

772
01:19:18,744 --> 01:19:23,374
in your presence, then I have
repeated it a thousand times

773
01:19:23,582 --> 01:19:29,612
in my heart. For it was the
fear of losing you forever.

774
01:19:33,492 --> 01:19:34,823
For love of you,

775
01:19:35,794 --> 01:19:39,855
Is hall conquer that fear
and bring you this letter

776
01:19:42,334 --> 01:19:44,199
Once you are savoured Angel

777
01:19:45,137 --> 01:19:48,402
you'll hold the rest
of my life in your hands.

778
01:19:50,876 --> 01:19:56,314
I hope and I tremble. I love you.

779
01:20:34,753 --> 01:20:35,515
Oh darling!

780
01:20:45,297 --> 01:20:47,925
I've been assumed to put
an edge on my appetite.

781
01:20:50,102 --> 01:20:51,296
I'm starving.

782
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:53,331
Angel.

783
01:23:53,968 --> 01:23:55,765
Angel please.
I must speak to you.

784
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:56,761
What's the matter?

785
01:23:57,104 --> 01:24:01,040
I want to confess all my past faults, all of it!

786
01:24:02,109 --> 01:24:03,633
Later Sweetheart.Once we are married,

787
01:24:03,944 --> 01:24:05,104
we'll tell each other everything.

788
01:24:05,579 --> 01:24:07,809
I have some failings of my own to confess!

789
01:24:18,392 --> 01:24:20,257
I required and charge you both

790
01:24:20,861 --> 01:24:24,524
as you all have to answer
at that dreadful day of judgement.

791
01:24:25,332 --> 01:24:28,062
Let the secrets of all
hearts should be disclosed.

792
01:24:28,902 --> 01:24:30,733
If either of you know any impediments

793
01:24:31,271 --> 01:24:34,365
why you may not be
lawfully joined in matrimony,

794
01:24:34,975 --> 01:24:36,499
Ye do now confess.

795
01:24:41,648 --> 01:24:44,742
Will thou have this woman
for thou wedded wife

796
01:24:45,586 --> 01:24:46,450
To live together after
god's just ordinance

797
01:24:46,954 --> 01:24:49,388
In the holiest state of matrimony,

798
01:24:50,157 --> 01:24:53,422
will thou love her, comfort her,
honour and keep her in sickness

799
01:24:53,861 --> 01:24:57,957
and in health and forsaking
all other, keep thee only unto her,

800
01:24:58,632 --> 01:24:59,860
so long as ye both shall live?

801
01:25:00,734 --> 01:25:01,462
I will.

802
01:25:18,519 --> 01:25:21,147
Welcome sir, welcome ma'am.

803
01:25:21,989 --> 01:25:24,583
Mr Plunkit told me to make ye at home.

804
01:25:25,192 --> 01:25:27,683
The rooms, they are ready.
They are on the first floor.

805
01:25:28,028 --> 01:25:31,862
Mr Plunkit had to leave for Manchester
so you'll have the whole house

806
01:25:32,232 --> 01:25:36,896
to yourselves. I hope you
are very comfortable here.

807
01:25:37,237 --> 01:25:40,502
The house is inclined to be
damp but I put a good fire

808
01:25:40,808 --> 01:25:43,800
in the drawing room and
leave it the afternoon.

809
01:25:44,044 --> 01:25:48,481
As for food, look, I've prepared
you a cold supper and maybe

810
01:25:48,715 --> 01:25:50,683
there's a nice bottle of wine to go with it!

811
01:25:51,585 --> 01:25:55,385
Tomorrow, if you wish, I'll
bring you some of my husband's

812
01:25:55,956 --> 01:25:58,481
excellent cider. He makes it himself.

813
01:26:00,794 --> 01:26:03,763
Oh... oh... to use your ups...

814
01:26:06,834 --> 01:26:08,699
The... bedroom!

815
01:26:13,207 --> 01:26:14,970
A bit of surprise, love.

816
01:26:16,076 --> 01:26:17,703
I've totally prepared...

817
01:26:18,045 --> 01:26:19,239
my son picked it in the bush.

818
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,404
Oh... it's a good bed.

819
01:26:21,882 --> 01:26:24,282
I think you'll find that you like it.

820
01:26:25,252 --> 01:26:27,015
now i'll leave you to yourselves.

821
01:26:27,654 --> 01:26:28,518
cheerio

822
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:38,723
Which are my hands and which are yours?

823
01:26:40,167 --> 01:26:41,691
They are all yours.

824
01:27:09,696 --> 01:27:12,426
Open it. It's for you.

825
01:27:28,081 --> 01:27:29,105
Family jewels.

826
01:27:31,151 --> 01:27:31,981
Is this for me?

827
01:27:32,686 --> 01:27:33,311
Of course.

828
01:27:35,455 --> 01:27:36,285
Truly?

829
01:27:38,759 --> 01:27:42,160
Put them on. Put them on now.

830
01:28:27,608 --> 01:28:29,473
Oh god, how beautiful you are.

831
01:28:32,045 --> 01:28:32,943
Come and see.

832
01:28:52,332 --> 01:28:54,027
I have a confession to make my love.

833
01:28:57,971 --> 01:28:59,199
You have something to confess?

834
01:28:59,606 --> 01:29:02,700
Why not? You think far too highly of me.

835
01:29:03,844 --> 01:29:07,007
Now listen. I want you to forgive me.

836
01:29:08,015 --> 01:29:10,950
And not be angry with me
for failing to tell you earlier.

837
01:29:12,252 --> 01:29:13,913
This is nothing for fear of losing you.

838
01:29:17,024 --> 01:29:18,082
I shall be brief.

839
01:29:30,170 --> 01:29:33,901
Not long before we met,
I lived in London for a time.

840
01:29:35,409 --> 01:29:41,814
There, I met a woman older
than myself. Ours was a flase

841
01:29:42,316 --> 01:29:48,915
relationship. A sad one.
It was all over in a few weeks.

842
01:29:54,661 --> 01:29:55,958
That's all there is to tell.

843
01:29:58,598 --> 01:29:59,462
Do you forgive me?

844
01:30:00,834 --> 01:30:04,270
Angel, oh, Angel.

845
01:30:06,273 --> 01:30:07,706
You are so utterly good and gentle

846
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:09,269
I was mad to fear you'll hate me.

847
01:30:10,243 --> 01:30:13,212
I have a confession too Angel.
Something of a same kind.

848
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:14,870
Well, tell me at table. WE'll talk over supper.

849
01:30:15,115 --> 01:30:15,843
I'm hungry, aren't you?

850
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:20,079
I told you. I have a confession like your own.

851
01:30:20,887 --> 01:30:22,081
What confession?

852
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:25,584
I shall be just as brief.

853
01:30:35,569 --> 01:30:38,834
His name is D'Urberville like mine.

854
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:41,873
Alexander D'Urberville.

855
01:30:45,278 --> 01:30:47,246
His family bought the title.

856
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:50,211
Their real name is Stoke.

857
01:30:55,655 --> 01:30:58,351
It was fate that drove me to work

858
01:30:58,925 --> 01:31:02,793
for false relations as a way of
hoping my own folk to live.

859
01:31:05,799 --> 01:31:11,931
Alec, Alexander took advantage of me.

860
01:31:14,107 --> 01:31:16,667
Lioness strengh... my defeat.

861
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:24,478
I became his mistress
and his affaire without love.

862
01:31:27,521 --> 01:31:33,460
Like yours, my sad union
ended after a few weeks.

863
01:31:34,861 --> 01:31:41,892
We bore a child which died very young.

864
01:31:45,872 --> 01:31:48,238
My life was a ruins until the day I met you.

865
01:32:28,915 --> 01:32:29,677
I'm going out.

866
01:33:22,035 --> 01:33:24,435
If you don't forgive me......

867
01:33:27,774 --> 01:33:29,002
but I forgive you, Angel.

868
01:33:29,209 --> 01:33:29,834
Yes, I know.

869
01:33:32,712 --> 01:33:36,614
But you.... you don't forgive me?

870
01:33:37,617 --> 01:33:39,312
You were one person, now you are another.

871
01:33:42,122 --> 01:33:42,918
I have mercy.

872
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:47,988
I have mercy.

873
01:33:48,895 --> 01:33:50,294
Angel, what do you mean by that laugh?

874
01:33:53,366 --> 01:33:54,799
How can you speak to me like this?

875
01:33:55,135 --> 01:33:57,797
It frightens me. How can you?

876
01:33:58,038 --> 01:33:59,096
You are not the woman I loved.

877
01:34:00,941 --> 01:34:01,873
Well, who am I then?

878
01:34:02,242 --> 01:34:03,903
Another woman in her shape.

879
01:34:08,648 --> 01:34:11,583
It is not the woman I love... but

880
01:34:12,819 --> 01:34:14,650
another woman in her shape.

881
01:34:19,926 --> 01:34:21,484
Angel, Angel, please.

882
01:34:21,728 --> 01:34:23,491
I was a child, a child when it happened.

883
01:34:23,797 --> 01:34:25,128
I... I knew nothing of men.

884
01:34:25,498 --> 01:34:27,090
You were sinned against. That I grant you.

885
01:34:29,769 --> 01:34:31,430
So you don't forgive me.

886
01:34:31,638 --> 01:34:34,266
I forgive you, but forgiveness isn't all.

887
01:34:36,142 --> 01:34:37,473
You don't love me.

888
01:34:38,511 --> 01:34:39,910
I can not help associating your lack

889
01:34:40,113 --> 01:34:41,842
of firmness with thedecline of your family.

890
01:34:42,816 --> 01:34:43,976
Decrepid families imply indeficient

891
01:34:44,217 --> 01:34:45,912
will-power and indecadent conduct.

892
01:34:46,353 --> 01:34:48,253
I thought you were a child of nature.

893
01:34:48,922 --> 01:34:50,116
But you are the last in the line

894
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:51,348
of degenerate aristocrats.

895
01:36:30,090 --> 01:36:31,819
Breakfast is ready.

896
01:37:12,999 --> 01:37:13,931
You can get rid of me.

897
01:37:16,803 --> 01:37:17,827
What did you say?

898
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:21,598
You can get rid of me.

899
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:25,168
You won't see me.

900
01:37:27,514 --> 01:37:27,912
Good god.

901
01:37:31,484 --> 01:37:32,951
How can you be so simple?

902
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:38,580
You are too much of a child.
Too immature.

903
01:37:39,459 --> 01:37:40,687
Too ignorant I suppose.

904
01:37:51,070 --> 01:37:52,537
Leave that!

905
01:37:53,339 --> 01:37:54,772
You are my wife, not my servant.

906
01:37:59,946 --> 01:38:05,680
I am your wife but you
don't want to live with me.

907
01:38:08,154 --> 01:38:10,179
You are going to go, aren't you?

908
01:38:11,291 --> 01:38:13,020
I couldn't stay without despising myself

909
01:38:15,161 --> 01:38:16,856
which is worse than despising you.

910
01:38:19,332 --> 01:38:22,495
How can we live together
while that man exists?

911
01:38:23,236 --> 01:38:27,696
He is your natural husband. Not I.

912
01:38:37,483 --> 01:38:40,452
Can you honestly tell me to stay?

913
01:38:42,822 --> 01:38:44,517
No.

914
01:38:56,436 --> 01:38:58,734
But it's absolutely necessary
that one of us remain here

915
01:39:00,273 --> 01:39:01,900
to avoid a scandal.

916
01:39:04,377 --> 01:39:06,641
We must at least keep up appearances.

917
01:39:08,815 --> 01:39:09,873
Oh yes we must.

918
01:39:14,087 --> 01:39:15,247
What will you do?

919
01:39:19,158 --> 01:39:20,216
I can go home.

920
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:21,992
You sure?

921
01:39:25,231 --> 01:39:28,098
If you leave me, I shall go home.

922
01:39:29,903 --> 01:39:30,733
Certainly.

923
01:39:59,265 --> 01:40:00,755
Cross-in-hands, sir.

924
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:01,798
Yes I know.

925
01:40:02,268 --> 01:40:03,826
Come

926
01:40:15,748 --> 01:40:17,147
Now let's be clear about this.

927
01:40:17,784 --> 01:40:19,445
There's no anger in our hearts.

928
01:40:20,053 --> 01:40:21,384
Even though something
has happened between us

929
01:40:21,621 --> 01:40:22,815
which I cannot endure at present.

930
01:40:23,489 --> 01:40:24,649
I shall let you know where I go

931
01:40:25,792 --> 01:40:27,282
and if I think i can
bare it, if I'm capable of it,

932
01:40:27,493 --> 01:40:29,620
I shall come to fetch you.

933
01:40:30,129 --> 01:40:31,255
I shall wait.

934
01:40:32,165 --> 01:40:34,497
Until then, you'd do better
not to try and join me.

935
01:40:36,569 --> 01:40:39,231
Until then, I must not join you.

936
01:40:44,310 --> 01:40:46,574
May I write to you?

937
01:40:46,746 --> 01:40:49,271
Oh yes. If you are ill
or in need of anything.

938
01:41:27,587 --> 01:41:29,953
Ha very good day to you Mr Clare.

939
01:41:30,456 --> 01:41:31,980
I've brought you some groceries.

940
01:41:32,291 --> 01:41:34,885
There is some chicken,
come sausages and bacon.

941
01:41:35,194 --> 01:41:35,819
Thank you, thank you so much.

942
01:41:36,029 --> 01:41:38,361
I've also brought you some butter,
some flour, a dozen eggs

943
01:41:38,598 --> 01:41:39,565
But that's far too much.

944
01:41:39,766 --> 01:41:41,495
Newly-weds are always hungry sir!

945
01:41:42,435 --> 01:41:45,165
From tonight onwards,
I shall cook for you myself.

946
01:41:45,438 --> 01:41:48,202
The truth is, you see, for sometime
I shall be needing less than

947
01:41:48,508 --> 01:41:51,534
that, because, infact,
I shall be alone for a day or two.

948
01:41:51,677 --> 01:41:53,577
My wife has been obliged
to rejoin her parents.

949
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:56,112
Was there any illness in the family?

950
01:41:56,282 --> 01:41:58,409
No no nothing of that kind.
It was all arranged beforehand.

951
01:41:58,651 --> 01:42:00,551
So as far as all my meals
are concerned during Mrs. Clare's

952
01:42:00,787 --> 01:42:03,051
absence, I'll talk of that later.

953
01:42:03,222 --> 01:42:04,985
Well shall... shall I leave the basket?

954
01:42:05,058 --> 01:42:06,616
Yes, indeed... the basket'll do for the day.

955
01:43:14,093 --> 01:43:16,152
I was passing on my way home sir.

956
01:43:16,829 --> 01:43:18,660
WE wanted to wish you well.

957
01:43:18,931 --> 01:43:20,558
You and Mrs. Clare.

958
01:43:20,766 --> 01:43:21,824
She's not here.

959
01:43:22,168 --> 01:43:23,760
I'm on the point of leaving
myself as you see.

960
01:43:24,770 --> 01:43:25,464
I'm leaving England.

961
01:43:25,738 --> 01:43:27,000
I've made up my mind to go to Brazil.

962
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:31,840
Brazil? I am pleased.Tell Mrs Clare,

963
01:43:32,712 --> 01:43:34,236
I hope the journey agrees with her.

964
01:43:34,514 --> 01:43:35,412
She will not be leaving for the present.

965
01:43:35,615 --> 01:43:36,377
I'm going on ahead to get

966
01:43:36,582 --> 01:43:38,516
the measure of the place and
see what life there is like.

967
01:43:52,131 --> 01:43:53,325
How's Retty?

968
01:43:53,799 --> 01:43:55,266
Good. REtty's as strong as ever.

969
01:43:57,170 --> 01:43:57,761
And Marian?

970
01:43:58,738 --> 01:44:00,365
Marianne's taken to drinks sir.

971
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:01,263
Really?

972
01:44:01,541 --> 01:44:03,634
Yes.Mr Crick's got rid of her.

973
01:44:04,710 --> 01:44:06,905
And you lzz. Are you well?

974
01:44:09,448 --> 01:44:11,848
With you gone sir, how could we be?

975
01:44:14,954 --> 01:44:16,615
There... tis said.

976
01:44:18,591 --> 01:44:19,455
Bye sir.

977
01:44:24,163 --> 01:44:24,822
Goodbye lzz.

978
01:44:44,116 --> 01:44:44,912
Izz!

979
01:45:05,504 --> 01:45:07,301
If I was to ask you to
come with me now,

980
01:45:08,874 --> 01:45:09,932
Come to Brazil with me,

981
01:45:11,010 --> 01:45:11,999
would your answer be yes?

982
01:45:13,746 --> 01:45:16,874
To come with you I should
leave everything this minute.

983
01:45:17,250 --> 01:45:19,946
You know what it will mean
in the eyes of the society.

984
01:45:20,253 --> 01:45:21,481
I wouldn't care.

985
01:45:21,921 --> 01:45:22,751
Do you love me so much?

986
01:45:23,956 --> 01:45:25,890
I've always loved you.

987
01:45:26,259 --> 01:45:27,749
More than Tess.

988
01:45:33,933 --> 01:45:37,699
No. Not more than her.

989
01:45:40,539 --> 01:45:42,439
Nobody could have
loved you more than Tess.

990
01:45:44,877 --> 01:45:46,401
She would have given her life for you.

991
01:45:48,247 --> 01:45:49,441
I could do no more.

992
01:48:36,549 --> 01:48:37,982
Oh... it's vanity.

993
01:49:20,576 --> 01:49:21,376
Good night my pretty.

994
01:49:21,416 --> 01:49:22,856
Good night sir.

995
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:27,376
It is late for a maid to be roaming
around the mane by herself.

996
01:49:28,577 --> 01:49:30,777
Have you lost your way then?

997
01:49:32,778 --> 01:49:36,018
Step up here beside me and
I'll take you a part of the road.

998
01:49:38,419 --> 01:49:41,419
for you scarce put one
foot in front of the other.

999
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:44,140
Ride with me I say.

1000
01:49:48,421 --> 01:49:50,981
Ah? But I know you.

1001
01:49:52,782 --> 01:49:55,702
You are that Mr Stokes-
D'Uberville's fancy woman.

1002
01:49:56,463 --> 01:50:00,463
You weren't too proud
to cock-a-leg for Groby.

1003
01:50:03,984 --> 01:50:05,664
Trollop!

1004
01:50:22,388 --> 01:50:23,948
If it isn't my little Tess.

1005
01:50:30,990 --> 01:50:34,190
Oh poor poppet. What a state you are in.

1006
01:50:35,871 --> 01:50:37,791
You are so cold!

1007
01:50:43,512 --> 01:50:46,432
Here. Get that inside you

1008
01:50:47,033 --> 01:50:48,353
This will warm your bones

1009
01:50:51,034 --> 01:50:52,714
Go on my love. Drink it.

1010
01:51:02,716 --> 01:51:03,716
Get it out

1011
01:51:05,037 --> 01:51:06,917
You mustn't let yourself go.

1012
01:51:07,117 --> 01:51:09,037
Even bad luck runs out in the end.

1013
01:51:09,637 --> 01:51:10,877
Take my word for it.

1014
01:51:11,598 --> 01:51:12,798
I can't go on.

1015
01:51:13,318 --> 01:51:15,038
You'll feel better tomorrow.

1016
01:51:15,479 --> 01:51:19,959
OH no. I can't go on. My life...

1017
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:25,960
If I had the courage, I'd like to die.

1018
01:51:26,641 --> 01:51:28,841
Don't talk such flubbery.

1019
01:51:29,962 --> 01:51:31,962
Why didn't you come and see me sooner?

1020
01:51:33,242 --> 01:51:34,762
Eh? I could have taken you in here, my girl.

1021
01:51:35,203 --> 01:51:36,083
Is there still some work here.

1022
01:51:36,403 --> 01:51:38,163
In this wretched place?

1023
01:51:39,363 --> 01:51:42,203
There's always work here.

1024
01:51:52,166 --> 01:51:54,686
Come... have some
of my nice soup.

1025
01:52:00,488 --> 01:52:04,408
After that, we must
take off those slum,

1026
01:52:04,929 --> 01:52:08,409
mirky clothes and
prettify yourself. Eh?

1027
01:52:15,491 --> 01:52:18,251
Just to make me jealous again, hey?

1028
01:52:20,972 --> 01:52:22,012
WEll, Tessy.

1029
01:53:41,308 --> 01:53:42,308
Are you the new hand?

1030
01:53:51,550 --> 01:53:53,950
T'was you was it?

1031
01:53:57,071 --> 01:53:58,551
Is that all you've done?

1032
01:53:59,391 --> 01:54:00,871
T'is a mighty poor show.

1033
01:54:01,392 --> 01:54:02,872
She's not accustomed to it.

1034
01:54:03,032 --> 01:54:04,552
I don't keep useless hands here.

1035
01:54:05,073 --> 01:54:06,273
I'm not payed for what we do.

1036
01:54:06,553 --> 01:54:07,913
So where's the difference?

1037
01:54:08,073 --> 01:54:08,833
No arguing.

1038
01:54:09,033 --> 01:54:10,353
I want the whole lot cleared.

1039
01:54:10,954 --> 01:54:11,594
Well, it's too late.

1040
01:54:13,074 --> 01:54:14,194
You'd better.

1041
01:54:22,716 --> 01:54:24,156
Now, you not mind Groby.

1042
01:54:25,477 --> 01:54:26,517
T'is just as well.

1043
01:54:27,037 --> 01:54:28,477
Ah... I know lord loves us.

1044
01:54:29,037 --> 01:54:30,477
but it's not like it was at the dairy.

1045
01:54:31,158 --> 01:54:32,878
Dairyman on the deck all the week,

1046
01:54:33,758 --> 01:54:35,638
On Sundays he's the Mr Richard Crick!

1047
01:55:35,451 --> 01:55:37,411
It don't do to pray here missy.

1048
01:55:41,532 --> 01:55:43,212
There's been a curse on this place.

1049
01:55:45,693 --> 01:55:47,253
This is the Cross-in-hand, isn't it?

1050
01:55:47,453 --> 01:55:48,573
Aye. So it is.

1051
01:55:50,174 --> 01:55:53,094
On the count of a malefactor
they tortured here, in ancient times

1052
01:55:53,334 --> 01:55:58,455
they did nail his hand onto the
post and then they hangged him.

1053
01:55:59,736 --> 01:56:03,416
The bones are down
there to this day I'm told.

1054
01:58:44,248 --> 01:58:45,208
OH!

1055
01:58:48,129 --> 01:58:48,969
What have you found?

1056
01:58:49,810 --> 01:58:51,530
An old pair of boots.

1057
01:58:57,571 --> 01:58:58,971
STill in good condition.

1058
01:59:02,852 --> 01:59:04,332
Could be of use to the poor.

1059
01:59:59,663 --> 02:00:01,303
There! Have a look.

1060
02:00:50,474 --> 02:00:52,634
I knew nothing of your circumstances.

1061
02:00:52,994 --> 02:00:55,874
Nothing at all until your mother wrote to me.

1062
02:00:56,075 --> 02:00:56,755
My mother?

1063
02:00:56,995 --> 02:01:00,035
She wrote what you should
have told me a long time ago.

1064
02:01:01,676 --> 02:01:02,716
I came at once.

1065
02:01:05,277 --> 02:01:06,117
Tess...

1066
02:01:14,799 --> 02:01:16,159
Why did you never say anything?

1067
02:01:16,599 --> 02:01:18,239
I had nothing to ask of you.

1068
02:01:19,519 --> 02:01:20,399
That isn't so.

1069
02:01:22,040 --> 02:01:25,520
You wear your ridiculous pride like a h

1070
02:01:26,321 --> 02:01:28,761
And you put me even more
in the wrong than I was!

1071
02:01:29,681 --> 02:01:30,761
Against my will

1072
02:01:32,282 --> 02:01:34,362
I have done my duty for my child.

1073
02:01:35,643 --> 02:01:36,963
On my honour i did it.

1074
02:01:37,643 --> 02:01:38,723
honour...

1075
02:01:40,644 --> 02:01:42,924
I want to take you away
from this wretched place.

1076
02:01:43,284 --> 02:01:44,324
Somewhere you're worthy of.

1077
02:01:45,485 --> 02:01:49,765
What is this strange temptation
that misery holds for you?

1078
02:01:50,646 --> 02:01:52,366
Come to your senses.

1079
02:01:53,166 --> 02:01:54,206
Come away with me.

1080
02:01:59,647 --> 02:02:00,567
your father's ill.

1081
02:02:00,688 --> 02:02:01,448
Did you know?

1082
02:02:02,408 --> 02:02:03,048
yes...

1083
02:02:03,888 --> 02:02:05,848
they fear the worst.

1084
02:02:06,449 --> 02:02:09,649
your family will be evicted if he dies.

1085
02:02:12,410 --> 02:02:14,490
I'm offering you my help sincerely.

1086
02:02:16,571 --> 02:02:17,811
Noone else seems to care.

1087
02:02:19,491 --> 02:02:22,051
Who is this husband of yours?

1088
02:02:23,172 --> 02:02:24,412
How can he abandon you like this?

1089
02:02:25,533 --> 02:02:27,413
Tess!

1090
02:04:50,522 --> 02:04:54,082
There's a point beyond
which obstinity becomes stupedity.

1091
02:04:57,683 --> 02:04:59,643
Are you in love with this drudgery?

1092
02:05:02,684 --> 02:05:04,324
I may be a sham-D'Urberville

1093
02:05:04,644 --> 02:05:06,484
but my little finger can
do more for you than

1094
02:05:06,765 --> 02:05:08,045
your blue-blooded ancestors.

1095
02:05:12,126 --> 02:05:15,646
I'm right. You know I am.

1096
02:05:21,328 --> 02:05:23,088
Forget about all this

1097
02:05:24,488 --> 02:05:25,328
and forget about that mule

1098
02:05:25,769 --> 02:05:27,009
that you call your husband.

1099
02:05:31,370 --> 02:05:34,970
Go on. Hit me. I shall not cry out.

1100
02:05:36,651 --> 02:05:38,571
Once beckon...
always beckon again.

1101
02:05:39,411 --> 02:05:40,211
That's law.

1102
02:05:40,972 --> 02:05:41,972
I was your master once

1103
02:05:44,692 --> 02:05:45,412
and so shall be again.

1104
02:05:47,853 --> 02:05:51,213
If you are any man's wife,
you are mine.

1105
02:05:53,294 --> 02:05:54,494
My own dear husband.

1106
02:05:55,855 --> 02:05:58,455
I shall die soon unless
I get a word from you.

1107
02:05:59,856 --> 02:06:02,056
All my letter have
remained unanswered.

1108
02:06:03,936 --> 02:06:06,256
Have you even received them?

1109
02:06:08,217 --> 02:06:12,377
I long for one thing only.
And that is to see you again.

1110
02:06:13,658 --> 02:06:14,778
Come back to me Angel.

1111
02:06:16,099 --> 02:06:19,259
Come back to me and save me
from the thing that threatens me.

1112
02:06:53,706 --> 02:06:57,626
Any reasonable person would
call this a ludicrous situation.

1113
02:06:59,227 --> 02:07:02,747
I offered to help you.
You wanned all of that.

1114
02:07:04,108 --> 02:07:07,548
You prefer to turnyourself into gypsies.

1115
02:07:08,309 --> 02:07:08,789
Please go.

1116
02:07:09,589 --> 02:07:12,589
In other words, Mrs. Clare,
you are asking me to let

1117
02:07:12,830 --> 02:07:13,790
you starve in peace.

1118
02:07:14,030 --> 02:07:15,030
Go away!

1119
02:07:16,711 --> 02:07:18,431
You'll be civil yet.

1120
02:07:26,233 --> 02:07:28,473
What's to become of me
and my poor little mites?

1121
02:07:29,754 --> 02:07:31,634
WE be the D'Urberville family.

1122
02:07:31,874 --> 02:07:32,954
It's written there isn't it?

1123
02:07:33,394 --> 02:07:35,994
Oh yeah... it's written there
fine enough. I grant you.

1124
02:07:36,475 --> 02:07:37,675
But the rooms have been taken.

1125
02:07:38,555 --> 02:07:39,835
You never sent in your deposits.

1126
02:07:41,156 --> 02:07:43,556
He means the money to
pay for the account, mother.

1127
02:07:44,356 --> 02:07:46,236
There's more to life than money sir!

1128
02:07:47,157 --> 02:07:50,077
You can not leave these poor,
fatherless children in the streets.

1129
02:07:50,518 --> 02:07:51,358
It would be a crime!

1130
02:07:51,598 --> 02:07:52,038
Missus...

1131
02:07:52,238 --> 02:07:54,518
Hospitality is sacred,
even among the Pagan Turks!

1132
02:07:54,879 --> 02:07:56,519
Please Missus... tis your own fault.

1133
02:07:56,879 --> 02:07:57,879
We'll see about that.

1134
02:07:58,479 --> 02:08:00,959
We are a true descendents
of the knightly D'Urbervilles.

1135
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:03,640
Nobody leaves us in
the streets like raw apples.

1136
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:07,080
Not in the home of our ancestors.
Our boards are in the

1137
02:08:07,281 --> 02:08:09,041
crip there laid out there in their carpets.

1138
02:08:09,241 --> 02:08:09,921
what's with you...

1139
02:08:10,322 --> 02:08:13,442
No, my dear. What's true is true.
Your poor father's eyes

1140
02:08:13,722 --> 02:08:15,282
are on us. We mustn't shame him.

1141
02:08:16,643 --> 02:08:19,963
Oh lord protect his own.
On the weekly champ he punished.

1142
02:08:20,644 --> 02:08:21,924
Ladies stopping here then?

1143
02:08:22,444 --> 02:08:24,044
no my good man. we are going on.

1144
02:08:24,805 --> 02:08:25,925
Good man... good man...

1145
02:08:26,405 --> 02:08:28,605
I ought to get by to Marlott.

1146
02:08:48,409 --> 02:08:49,249
Unload Darrell.

1147
02:08:49,689 --> 02:08:50,209
Where?

1148
02:08:50,490 --> 02:08:50,890
Here!

1149
02:08:51,210 --> 02:08:52,010
Here?

1150
02:08:52,250 --> 02:08:52,850
Yes Here.

1151
02:08:53,370 --> 02:08:55,090
We shall camp beside our church

1152
02:08:55,611 --> 02:08:56,931
until the town of our ancestors,

1153
02:08:57,171 --> 02:08:58,011
Find us our shelters.

1154
02:08:58,651 --> 02:09:00,611
Now come on children.
Set to work.

1155
02:10:42,952 --> 02:10:44,992
Why am I on the
wrong side of this door?

1156
02:11:57,207 --> 02:11:57,687
Yeah!

1157
02:11:58,127 --> 02:12:00,327
It's me Father, Angel!

1158
02:12:12,410 --> 02:12:15,090
My boy, my poor boy.

1159
02:12:15,411 --> 02:12:17,531
I've been ill but I'm alright now.

1160
02:12:34,775 --> 02:12:37,575
Why have you treated me
so monstrously Angel?

1161
02:12:38,615 --> 02:12:43,055
I do not deserve it.
I have thought it over carefully

1162
02:12:44,256 --> 02:12:46,536
and I can never, never forgive you.

1163
02:12:47,777 --> 02:12:51,777
You are cruel. I shall try to forget you.

1164
02:12:52,778 --> 02:12:56,858
All I ever received of
your hands is injustice.

1165
02:14:18,755 --> 02:14:20,195
Mr Durbeyfield.

1166
02:14:22,836 --> 02:14:24,396
Beg your pardon?

1167
02:14:25,037 --> 02:14:26,037
You are Mr Durbeyfield?

1168
02:14:27,597 --> 02:14:29,597
They don't live here no more.

1169
02:14:29,758 --> 02:14:30,798
Since when?

1170
02:14:31,918 --> 02:14:33,278
Since John Durbeyfield died.

1171
02:14:34,598 --> 02:14:35,918
Do you know where they went?

1172
02:14:49,521 --> 02:14:52,121
Durbeyfield... from 1832 to 1888

1173
02:14:53,002 --> 02:14:55,562
more properly D'Urberville of once

1174
02:14:55,883 --> 02:14:56,883
powerful family of that name

1175
02:14:57,923 --> 02:15:00,043
and directly descended
through illustrious lines

1176
02:15:00,284 --> 02:15:03,644
of Pagan D'Urberville.
Likes of a conqueror.

1177
02:15:04,124 --> 02:15:05,364
How are the mighty fallen?

1178
02:15:06,925 --> 02:15:08,645
Ah yes... how indeed.

1179
02:15:09,365 --> 02:15:11,325
May I? for the poor.

1180
02:15:13,446 --> 02:15:15,166
I prefer to settle
the Mason's account.

1181
02:15:16,327 --> 02:15:18,367
You'd think he's never
been paid for his work.

1182
02:15:20,848 --> 02:15:22,008
They were an odd family.

1183
02:15:22,608 --> 02:15:24,088
My collegue Mr Tringham,
would have done

1184
02:15:24,368 --> 02:15:25,608
better to have kept his mouth shut.

1185
02:16:00,816 --> 02:16:03,016
I should like to see Mrs Clare.

1186
02:16:06,177 --> 02:16:06,937
Tess

1187
02:16:08,257 --> 02:16:10,257
Yes I know. She's not here.

1188
02:16:11,898 --> 02:16:13,178
You are Mrs. Durbeyfield.

1189
02:16:14,458 --> 02:16:15,218
Yes

1190
02:16:16,339 --> 02:16:17,219
Where is she living?

1191
02:16:18,379 --> 02:16:19,099
I don't know.

1192
02:16:20,860 --> 02:16:21,780
I'm her husband.

1193
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:24,180
I guessed as much.

1194
02:16:25,821 --> 02:16:26,941
Then tell me where she is.

1195
02:16:27,941 --> 02:16:28,901
Please, tell me.

1196
02:16:29,261 --> 02:16:32,421
Leave her. Leave her in peace.

1197
02:16:33,262 --> 02:16:35,422
My poor girl's suffered enough.

1198
02:16:36,783 --> 02:16:39,863
She don't care to see you sir. Never.

1199
02:16:55,467 --> 02:16:57,187
Mrs Durbeyfield,

1200
02:16:57,827 --> 02:16:59,987
take pity on a lonely,
wretched man.

1201
02:17:00,148 --> 02:17:01,588
Tell me where to find her.

1202
02:17:03,228 --> 02:17:03,988
I beg you.

1203
02:17:06,029 --> 02:17:06,949
She's at Sandbourne.

1204
02:17:07,149 --> 02:17:09,429
Sandbourne? But where?

1205
02:17:09,790 --> 02:17:11,270
It's a large town these days.

1206
02:17:11,590 --> 02:17:14,230
That's all I know. Sandbourne.

1207
02:17:42,636 --> 02:17:43,476
Excuse me.

1208
02:17:44,636 --> 02:17:46,196
I'm looking for a Mrs. Clare.

1209
02:17:46,797 --> 02:17:48,757
Would you by any
chance know her address?

1210
02:17:51,438 --> 02:17:54,878
Ah, George. You got a Clare around?

1211
02:17:57,479 --> 02:17:59,839
No... we've had a lot of
visitors here. You know.

1212
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:01,480
Or Durbeyfield. Miss Durbeyfield.

1213
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:03,120
D'Urberville at the Herons.

1214
02:18:03,360 --> 02:18:04,000
That's it. D'Urberville.

1215
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:06,560
It's a boarding house sir. Can't miss it.

1216
02:18:06,761 --> 02:18:07,361
Where abouts?

1217
02:19:02,212 --> 02:19:02,732
Yes?

1218
02:19:03,372 --> 02:19:05,012
Please excuse me
for calling at this hour.

1219
02:19:05,893 --> 02:19:08,613
But do you have a Teresa
D'Urberville staying in your board?

1220
02:19:09,093 --> 02:19:10,213
Mrs D'Urberville you mean?

1221
02:19:10,894 --> 02:19:11,574
Yes.

1222
02:19:12,734 --> 02:19:13,454
Please come in.

1223
02:19:19,095 --> 02:19:20,655
Would be kind enough to
tell her that her relative

1224
02:19:20,856 --> 02:19:21,696
is anxious to see her?

1225
02:19:22,016 --> 02:19:23,816
It's rather early sir. What name shall I give?

1226
02:19:24,136 --> 02:19:24,896
Angel.

1227
02:19:25,377 --> 02:19:26,057
Mr Angel?

1228
02:19:26,377 --> 02:19:29,097
Angel. It's my christian name.
She'll understand.

1229
02:19:35,779 --> 02:19:38,179
I'll go and see if she's awake.

1230
02:20:38,711 --> 02:20:42,311
Tess. I came to ask your forgiveness.

1231
02:20:46,673 --> 02:20:47,633
It's too late.

1232
02:20:49,273 --> 02:20:52,273
Too late? My darling wife.

1233
02:20:53,674 --> 02:20:54,914
I've come to fetch you.
I'm going to...

1234
02:20:55,595 --> 02:20:58,155
Don't come near me Angel please.

1235
02:21:00,956 --> 02:21:03,796
Too Late. Too Late.

1236
02:21:05,277 --> 02:21:09,557
I'm not the man I was. I've suffered too.

1237
02:21:11,798 --> 02:21:13,438
I humbly beg you to forgive me.

1238
02:21:16,039 --> 02:21:22,440
Yes. yes... But I tell you it's too late.

1239
02:21:26,881 --> 02:21:29,241
Don't you know at all? Don't you?

1240
02:21:32,122 --> 02:21:34,002
How did you find your way here?

1241
02:21:36,523 --> 02:21:37,363
I saw your mother.

1242
02:21:42,044 --> 02:21:43,564
I waited and waited for you.

1243
02:21:44,524 --> 02:21:45,404
But you didn't come.

1244
02:21:47,325 --> 02:21:49,165
I wrote to you. But you didn't come.

1245
02:21:53,446 --> 02:21:56,286
He has been good tome.
To all of us.

1246
02:22:00,808 --> 02:22:04,488
He's won me back to him.
He's upstairs.

1247
02:22:09,009 --> 02:22:11,729
Go now Angel. Go please.

1248
02:22:14,851 --> 02:22:16,811
Never come back anymore.

1249
02:23:42,948 --> 02:23:43,908
Good morning my dear

1250
02:23:58,671 --> 02:23:59,711
WEll, what's the matter now?

1251
02:24:04,552 --> 02:24:05,512
You feeling unwell?

1252
02:24:07,433 --> 02:24:08,593
Is that why you have the vapours?

1253
02:24:10,994 --> 02:24:14,914
Yes? No?

1254
02:24:18,235 --> 02:24:22,195
yes I know. You are moping as usual.

1255
02:24:26,397 --> 02:24:30,197
For god's sake, try and make an effort.

1256
02:24:37,559 --> 02:24:38,999
Did you have a bad dream?

1257
02:24:45,961 --> 02:24:47,481
Brazil perhaps?

1258
02:25:05,165 --> 02:25:08,005
These mooning hysterics
of yours are in poor taste.

1259
02:25:12,046 --> 02:25:13,926
Don't forget we are
lunching with the Bennets.

1260
02:25:14,927 --> 02:25:16,287
I'd like you to look presentable.

1261
02:25:19,327 --> 02:25:20,967
A genuine D'Urberville.

1262
02:27:26,913 --> 02:27:29,353
I came to tell you that I killed him.

1263
02:27:36,915 --> 02:27:38,035
I've done it.

1264
02:27:39,956 --> 02:27:40,956
I don't know how

1265
02:27:45,037 --> 02:27:45,997
I don't know.

1266
02:27:47,877 --> 02:27:50,117
I tried to rake him with my glove put

1267
02:27:51,718 --> 02:27:53,078
the blood in his mouth

1268
02:27:55,079 --> 02:27:56,759
I thought I might be capable of it

1269
02:27:59,439 --> 02:28:04,399
Yes... yes. It was from that day on

1270
02:28:05,521 --> 02:28:06,281
What's mean?

1271
02:28:07,961 --> 02:28:09,281
I've killed him

1272
02:28:19,363 --> 02:28:20,603
I won't desert you.

1273
02:28:21,564 --> 02:28:24,044
I shall protect you by
every means in my power.

1274
02:28:25,285 --> 02:28:27,325
Whatever you may or may
not have done, I love you.

1275
02:28:27,885 --> 02:28:29,445
I love you.

1276
02:28:31,126 --> 02:28:32,166
Will they hang me?

1277
02:28:42,248 --> 02:28:44,968
WE must get out at the next
station and head north on foot.

1278
02:28:46,409 --> 02:28:48,169
They'll be looking for us at the Wessex ports.

1279
02:28:49,730 --> 02:28:51,570
Once we reach the north
we'll go abroad.

1280
02:29:43,060 --> 02:29:44,340
WE have makings of a mule here.

1281
02:29:45,061 --> 02:29:45,941
and a bottle of wine.

1282
02:32:39,896 --> 02:32:41,096
Rest at last.

1283
02:36:34,062 --> 02:36:35,942
We must leave at once.

1284
02:36:40,384 --> 02:36:44,624
WE must leave here as soon as possible.

1285
02:36:46,185 --> 02:36:49,625
My life couldn't be a matter of weeks?

1286
02:36:51,306 --> 02:36:52,466
Why not wait for them here?

1287
02:36:53,866 --> 02:36:55,786
Since they'll catch me in any case.

1288
02:36:56,947 --> 02:36:58,027
I'm going to save you.

1289
02:36:58,547 --> 02:36:59,267
Do you hear?

1290
02:36:59,828 --> 02:37:01,028
I'm going to save you.

1291
02:38:20,684 --> 02:38:21,884
Can't we rest here?

1292
02:38:23,004 --> 02:38:27,004
I'm afraid not. By day this place
is visible from miles around.

1293
02:38:30,046 --> 02:38:31,886
There are no stars tonight.

1294
02:38:36,967 --> 02:38:39,807
Perhaps we could have made
our souls take flight together.

1295
02:38:49,369 --> 02:38:51,129
Do they sacrifice to god here?

1296
02:38:52,370 --> 02:38:56,210
No . To the sun I believe. It's a Pagan temple.

1297
02:38:59,732 --> 02:39:00,972
Older than the ages.

1298
02:39:03,932 --> 02:39:05,292
Older than the D'Urbervilles.

1299
02:39:14,294 --> 02:39:16,694
Do you think we shall meet again after death?

1300
02:39:24,696 --> 02:39:27,056
I'm afraid Angel. I'm afraid.

1301
02:40:36,791 --> 02:40:38,151
There's no use sir.

1302
02:40:39,111 --> 02:40:40,631
The whole country's roused.

1303
02:40:56,155 --> 02:41:00,275
She's sleeping. Just a little longer.

1304
02:41:19,079 --> 02:41:20,519
Have they come for me?

1305
02:41:21,800 --> 02:41:23,320
Yes.

1306
02:41:37,803 --> 02:41:39,203
I'm ready.
