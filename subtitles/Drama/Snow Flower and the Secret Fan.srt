1
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,681
People say I'm sending Sebastian
and Nina to New York..

2
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:04,057
so neither will take my job.

3
00:02:06,144 --> 00:02:07,853
Hey, perhaps that's partly true.

4
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:13,775
Like these butterflies that
surround us this evening..

5
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:17,988
it's a time of transformation,
new beginnings.

6
00:02:18,156 --> 00:02:19,823
In preparing to
open a new office..

7
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:23,201
I wanted to place my very
best people in charge of it.

8
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:25,078
And you truly are my best.

9
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:26,288
Oh.

10
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:35,714
To Sebastian and Nina. A toast.

11
00:02:35,882 --> 00:02:38,049
Nina and Sebastian. Thank you.

12
00:02:38,217 --> 00:02:40,552
Make us proud in New York.

13
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,596
And make us a lot of
money in New York.

14
00:02:57,528 --> 00:03:01,239
After dinner, we went to some restaurant.
And then someone came up and said..

15
00:04:19,443 --> 00:04:20,485
Hello?

16
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:22,946
Is this Nina Wei? Yes.

17
00:04:23,114 --> 00:04:26,199
I'm calling from Pu Tuo
Qu Hongkang Hospital.

18
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:27,826
What's going on?

19
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:30,203
Sophia Liao is in a
coma in our hospital.

20
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,538
What?

21
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:34,416
What? I'm sorry.

22
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:37,294
Ms. Liao was on her bike
and was hit by a taxi.

23
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:38,545
God.

24
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:41,256
Yours was the last number
dialed on her phone.

25
00:04:41,424 --> 00:04:42,882
She called me?

26
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,592
God.

27
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,012
Okay, I'm coming.

28
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:01,443
Oh, sorry.

29
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,117
Where is she?

30
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:41,941
Oh, my God.

31
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:51,785
I'm sorry.

32
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,166
How did we end up here?

33
00:05:58,334 --> 00:06:00,335
You went away.

34
00:06:01,003 --> 00:06:03,171
There is so much
distance between us.

35
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:07,092
What happened to the
promises we made?

36
00:06:21,232 --> 00:06:23,316
What's going on here?

37
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:24,818
Nina!

38
00:06:26,737 --> 00:06:29,739
Please don't bring this
music into my house.

39
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,410
And these buns you always bring.

40
00:06:33,577 --> 00:06:35,245
Look how oily they are.

41
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:39,290
Sophia.

42
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:43,670
When your mother died, I promised
her I'd raise you properly.

43
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:47,465
When you act out, I can't fulfill
your mother's final wish.

44
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,177
I know I'm only your stepmother.

45
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:53,847
Are you going to be
against me forever?

46
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,348
Huh?

47
00:06:57,184 --> 00:07:01,479
Nina, I'd like to have a word with you.
Follow me.

48
00:07:06,986 --> 00:07:09,696
That liar. She never
met my mother.

49
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:25,628
This is good music.

50
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:31,801
Come.

51
00:07:39,143 --> 00:07:41,644
I'll find someone else to
tutor her in Mandarin.

52
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,732
Do not come here again.

53
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,610
A smart girl like you..

54
00:07:48,777 --> 00:07:50,904
with a bright future..

55
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:55,366
shouldn't have to spend
all your time with her.

56
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:28,942
Come and meet my
family for dinner.

57
00:08:45,376 --> 00:08:47,126
This is so exciting.

58
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:49,379
I never get to visit
a real family.

59
00:08:51,382 --> 00:08:53,132
Here's the soup.

60
00:08:59,223 --> 00:09:01,641
It smells wonderful, Mrs. Wei.

61
00:09:02,685 --> 00:09:05,645
Thank you, Sophia.
It's all homemade.

62
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,066
So your family is Korean, right?

63
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:11,276
Mom.

64
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:14,988
I already told you
they come from Korea.

65
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:18,658
I didn't come to
Shanghai till I was 14.

66
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:22,662
That's why my Chinese is so bad.

67
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,456
- Very good.
- Thank you.

68
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,253
Shanghai is a seaport.
Everyone from somewhere else.

69
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:32,463
People come and they
go, come and they go.

70
00:09:33,257 --> 00:09:35,466
Enough of this silly English.

71
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,688
Nina. Nina.

72
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:52,275
Mrs. Liao's not at home.
Hey, it's you.

73
00:09:52,443 --> 00:09:59,073
So my niece told me Cixi Tai Hou busted
you for the Faye Wong tape, huh?

74
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,952
All I know

75
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,454
Teresa, huh?

76
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:09,042
Oh, what's this?
These are so tiny.

77
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,961
These are not easy to come by.

78
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:15,214
This shoe was for women
with tiny bound feet.

79
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,508
See? Called..

80
00:10:17,676 --> 00:10:19,385
3-inch golden lilies.

81
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,304
It's a shoe?

82
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:23,973
Do you know our family
came from Hunan?

83
00:10:24,141 --> 00:10:25,516
Oh, no.

84
00:10:25,684 --> 00:10:30,605
She's talking about my mother's
mother's mother's mother.

85
00:10:30,773 --> 00:10:32,315
I think I got that right, huh?
Mm-hm.

86
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:35,109
And her name was Snow Flower..

87
00:10:35,277 --> 00:10:38,529
and she had a
laotong named Lily.

88
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:40,239
Laotong?

89
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:43,993
Sworn sisters for life, laotong.

90
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:46,663
Like us.

91
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,748
Sister. Sister.

92
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,918
Sister. Sister. Ha, ha.

93
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:55,171
Girls, you have a lot to learn
about laotong commitment.

94
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:59,467
See, marriages used to be
made for men's reasons.

95
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:04,681
To form business alliances, to
manage households, to produce sons.

96
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:06,599
And they were obligatory.

97
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:12,563
A laotong's commitment was for
women's reasons, by choice.

98
00:11:12,731 --> 00:11:16,401
For companionship,
understanding and happiness.

99
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:21,948
What you're signing today is a symbol of
your deep-hearted love for each other.

100
00:11:22,408 --> 00:11:25,952
Deep-hearted love. I like that.

101
00:11:27,913 --> 00:11:30,248
Here is your laotong contract.

102
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,001
Your vow is written in nu sh..

103
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:36,462
Sign below it.

104
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:43,469
Oh, yes. The infamous
Wong Faye CD.

105
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,860
Sophia's bag is at reception.
You can pick it up.

106
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:01,154
Okay, thank you.

107
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,213
This is the story of
Snow Flower and Lily.

108
00:13:01,465 --> 00:13:05,593
Two girls born in the same
month, on the same day.

109
00:13:07,095 --> 00:13:10,515
Their feet bound
on the same day.

110
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:18,773
At that moment, their
destinies tied forever.

111
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:52,431
Mama, when can I go out to play?

112
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,934
Lily, this is more important.

113
00:13:55,102 --> 00:14:00,606
We must make your feet perfect so the
matchmaker can find you a good husband.

114
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:18,958
Madam, it is done.

115
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,295
Get up, walk.

116
00:14:29,052 --> 00:14:30,136
Get up!

117
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:33,264
Walk.

118
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:41,814
Mama, it hurts.

119
00:14:42,274 --> 00:14:43,649
Ten circles of the room.

120
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,741
Snow Flower! What are you doing?

121
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:54,660
Come back! Walk!

122
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,168
Only through pain
will you find beauty.

123
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:06,464
Only through suffering
will you find peace.

124
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:09,300
I wrap, I bind.

125
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,678
But you will have the reward.

126
00:15:14,222 --> 00:15:18,684
Come.

127
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:27,401
Back, again.

128
00:15:29,112 --> 00:15:30,529
Again.

129
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,501
Mama!

130
00:16:31,341 --> 00:16:34,260
These are the most perfect
feet I have ever seen.

131
00:16:34,636 --> 00:16:37,013
These are true golden lilies.

132
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:43,519
I will be able to find
her a good family.

133
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:46,063
But given your circumstances..

134
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:48,441
we must make another
match first.

135
00:16:51,028 --> 00:16:52,778
I have found you a laotong.

136
00:16:53,196 --> 00:16:55,698
Your sister in heart for life.

137
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:58,743
Her name is Snow Flower,
and she is from Tongkou.

138
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,578
Tongkou?

139
00:17:01,538 --> 00:17:04,457
A rich girl is too
good for my daughter.

140
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:08,961
This is true. Her
family is privileged.

141
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:11,964
Her grandfather was
an imperial scholar.

142
00:17:12,507 --> 00:17:16,469
But these girls have
compatible astrology signs..

143
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:20,097
so her mother does not mind
this class difference.

144
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:22,475
Can I meet her now?

145
00:17:26,021 --> 00:17:27,938
Snow Flower?

146
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,502
Nu shu is a secret
language between women.

147
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:53,506
It is personal, between
you and your laotong.

148
00:17:58,136 --> 00:18:02,139
That is why you
learn it together.

149
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:05,643
So you will know what
is in her heart.

150
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:12,483
Bright.

151
00:18:13,652 --> 00:18:15,361
Moon.

152
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:18,447
Correct? Yes.

153
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:38,676
The Temple of Gupo
fair is a holy place.

154
00:18:38,844 --> 00:18:43,973
We are here today in front of Gupo
to write your laotong contract.

155
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:48,561
And make your vows of
eternal commitment.

156
00:18:49,271 --> 00:18:52,064
My hand opens to yours.

157
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:54,525
We of good affection..

158
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:57,319
shall never sever our bond.

159
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:16,755
We will be laotong
for all eternity.

160
00:19:58,924 --> 00:20:02,051
Why can't you grow up?

161
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:04,803
Your mother's right.

162
00:20:05,555 --> 00:20:08,807
You don't get these
opportunities every day.

163
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:11,143
You have to go to New York.

164
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,686
You shouldn't feel guilty.

165
00:20:12,854 --> 00:20:15,272
Her accident had nothing
to do with you.

166
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,233
Enough.

167
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:22,488
Stop trying to convince me.
I've decided to stay.

168
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:29,912
I don't even know what her life
was like these past few months.

169
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,542
Now, with this accident, I need
to find out what happened to her.

170
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,652
Uh, hi, Sebastian. It's Nina.

171
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:07,491
I'm not sure when I can
meet you in New York.

172
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:09,285
I..

173
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:13,455
I just can't leave.

174
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,252
I need to be here for Sophia.

175
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,588
Sorry.

176
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:27,136
I'll be at the house.
Call me when you land.

177
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:29,263
Bye.

178
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:55,539
I am to marry a boy
I do not know.

179
00:21:55,707 --> 00:21:58,542
He is from a
distinguished family.

180
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:02,504
My life will change because
of my perfect feet.

181
00:22:02,672 --> 00:22:06,216
Sister, you must
come to my wedding.

182
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,859
Has Madame Wang found you
a match, Snow Flower?

183
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,745
What about bed business?

184
00:22:34,913 --> 00:22:37,414
Mama has never said
anything to me.

185
00:22:41,836 --> 00:22:47,174
It cannot be as hard as
embroidery or cleaning.

186
00:22:49,844 --> 00:22:51,136
Why are you laughing?

187
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:53,639
Stop laughing at me.

188
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:30,259
I am not a good daughter
for leaving you.

189
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:35,556
We are women.

190
00:23:36,057 --> 00:23:40,853
We are born to leave
our families.

191
00:23:53,825 --> 00:23:55,534
Mama.

192
00:23:56,494 --> 00:23:58,036
Go.

193
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:01,039
Mama.

194
00:24:47,212 --> 00:24:48,921
Lily.

195
00:24:50,006 --> 00:24:52,424
Never forget we are
vowed forever.

196
00:24:54,344 --> 00:24:56,178
No one will come between us.

197
00:24:58,139 --> 00:24:59,848
Snow Flower.

198
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:08,727
Sun, water and
firewood are free.

199
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:11,897
But salt is a commodity.

200
00:27:12,857 --> 00:27:15,192
The Taiping rebels are
creating chaos everywhere.

201
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,864
I am concerned about our son
trading in such a faraway place.

202
00:27:21,032 --> 00:27:23,950
What do women know
about such things?

203
00:27:24,118 --> 00:27:27,079
Within this household, I
make all the decisions!

204
00:27:28,373 --> 00:27:31,416
Obey, obey, obey.

205
00:27:32,543 --> 00:27:35,504
He will do what he wants.

206
00:27:44,597 --> 00:27:49,267
My father has granted me permission
to travel to Guilin to buy salt.

207
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:52,979
I will return and sell it here.

208
00:27:53,147 --> 00:27:56,900
Guilin. That is far.

209
00:27:57,068 --> 00:27:58,193
Is it safe?

210
00:27:59,654 --> 00:28:02,698
It is not a woman's
place to worry.

211
00:28:06,077 --> 00:28:10,497
I may be gone for a long time.

212
00:28:38,901 --> 00:28:41,945
Excuse me, is Claire here?

213
00:28:42,113 --> 00:28:43,572
She's inside. Thanks.

214
00:29:21,027 --> 00:29:22,819
Claire, you're here.

215
00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:26,364
Sophia's aunt is not here.

216
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:30,035
I know. Is there another
way to reach her?

217
00:29:30,203 --> 00:29:35,499
I'm in touch. She'll
be back tonight.

218
00:29:38,002 --> 00:29:40,504
Are these from Sophia's family?

219
00:29:40,671 --> 00:29:43,965
Yes, Sophia gave us these.

220
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:45,675
They all belong to her family.

221
00:29:45,843 --> 00:29:48,678
But the most important
one is missing.

222
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,140
Perhaps Sophia has it.

223
00:30:04,487 --> 00:30:08,406
This is a new interactive
nu shu program.

224
00:30:28,803 --> 00:30:35,016
You taught me how to be a good wife.
I must fulfill all my duties.

225
00:30:35,184 --> 00:30:40,730
The wife of the eldest son must
serve and honor her mother-in-law.

226
00:30:44,235 --> 00:30:51,199
My daughter's birth was a disappointment.
I must bear a son.

227
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:02,002
Madam, I would like to
visit Snow Flower..

228
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:05,046
and go to the Temple
of Gupo fair.

229
00:31:05,214 --> 00:31:09,634
We promised to meet
there every year.

230
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:14,139
I told you, Lily.

231
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:17,142
I do not approve of your
relationship with Snow Flower.

232
00:31:20,229 --> 00:31:22,480
She is my laotong.

233
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:24,900
We are vowed forever.

234
00:31:35,077 --> 00:31:36,494
Why do you forbid me to go?

235
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:43,877
You must go pray for a son.

236
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:46,838
Yong Gang will go with you.

237
00:31:56,849 --> 00:31:58,308
Yong Gang.

238
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:04,731
Take this to Snow Flower.

239
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:29,005
We must rely on the wind
to carry our words.

240
00:32:29,173 --> 00:32:32,634
Those winds are happy and sad.

241
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:39,391
We are forbidden to see each other.
But at every moment, I miss you.

242
00:33:01,205 --> 00:33:04,541
Wait for me.

243
00:33:06,836 --> 00:33:08,628
Snow Flower.

244
00:33:29,734 --> 00:33:32,986
How does your husband treat you?

245
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:38,616
And yours?

246
00:33:39,243 --> 00:33:40,910
Good.

247
00:33:41,829 --> 00:33:47,542
However, I do not know why
Lady Lu disapproves of you.

248
00:33:56,135 --> 00:33:58,261
But I am still here.

249
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:04,476
I am happy. Me too.

250
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:08,104
Lady Lu, I know what
I did was wrong.

251
00:34:08,272 --> 00:34:09,481
Lady Lu!

252
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:13,401
Disobedience is a
woman's greatest sin.

253
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,969
Auntie.

254
00:34:43,557 --> 00:34:45,391
You're here.

255
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:49,062
I flew all night and
all day to get back.

256
00:34:54,819 --> 00:34:56,444
You know..

257
00:34:57,154 --> 00:35:00,990
Sophia and I haven't
talked since that night.

258
00:35:01,158 --> 00:35:02,700
I know.

259
00:35:07,414 --> 00:35:12,210
When she first came back from Australia,
she came to see me at the gallery.

260
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:16,047
How was she?

261
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,051
She seemed..

262
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:22,220
very depressed.

263
00:35:22,388 --> 00:35:26,891
And she was more depressed the
next few times I saw her.

264
00:35:28,435 --> 00:35:31,062
She didn't even want me
to know where she lived.

265
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,814
Why?

266
00:35:34,483 --> 00:35:36,067
Did she come back with Arthur?

267
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:39,571
No. She told me she left him.

268
00:35:42,324 --> 00:35:44,534
I told her he was no good.

269
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:50,248
Nobody knows where she lives?

270
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:52,041
No.

271
00:36:18,152 --> 00:36:21,613
I should have told you earlier.

272
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:26,075
But I could not bear
to tell you the truth.

273
00:36:27,828 --> 00:36:32,373
My father was addicted
to the opium pipe.

274
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:36,127
He ruined our family.

275
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:53,811
Our fates have been reversed.

276
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:58,608
But our love will
always be strong.

277
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:48,574
I am happy we are blessed with sons.
We are fulfilling our fates.

278
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:55,331
But now the typhoid epidemic is upon us.
Death is all around.

279
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,836
Everyone is afraid and anxious.

280
00:38:00,004 --> 00:38:03,673
I hope you are safe
where you are.

281
00:38:24,028 --> 00:38:28,323
Dead, dead.

282
00:38:28,782 --> 00:38:30,908
Madam, it is time
for your medicine.

283
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:36,039
Everyone is dead.

284
00:38:36,206 --> 00:38:41,294
Madam!

285
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:56,100
Have some, madam. You
will feel better.

286
00:39:17,623 --> 00:39:19,791
- Children.
- Mother.

287
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:22,960
Do not come over here. Go back.

288
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:26,214
Mother, do not leave us.

289
00:39:26,382 --> 00:39:28,341
I am not avoiding you.

290
00:39:28,509 --> 00:39:31,260
I may be infected.

291
00:39:31,428 --> 00:39:33,471
Mother.

292
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:37,475
I am always with
you in my heart.

293
00:39:38,018 --> 00:39:39,477
Good children.

294
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:44,148
- Mother! Mother!
- Mother! Mother!

295
00:40:15,222 --> 00:40:17,306
The master is back!

296
00:40:18,976 --> 00:40:21,018
The master is back.

297
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:37,285
Master and Lady Lu passed away.
They both succumbed to the plague.

298
00:40:37,453 --> 00:40:41,080
On this day of the New Year..

299
00:40:41,248 --> 00:40:45,209
we became Master and Lady Lu.

300
00:41:44,561 --> 00:41:45,978
Mrs. Liao.

301
00:41:46,146 --> 00:41:50,399
It's Nina. I used to
teach Sophia Chinese.

302
00:41:50,984 --> 00:41:52,944
Do you remember me?

303
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:56,781
I remember.

304
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:02,662
I'd like to speak with
you about Sophia.

305
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:05,248
She's had a terrible accident.

306
00:42:05,707 --> 00:42:08,376
Accident? What accident?

307
00:42:08,544 --> 00:42:10,962
I haven't spoken
to her in years.

308
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:16,217
Sophia never saw
me as her mother.

309
00:42:18,011 --> 00:42:19,470
Don't touch me.

310
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:22,557
You see how I'm forced to live?

311
00:42:22,724 --> 00:42:25,476
My husband died, my
stepdaughter abuses me.

312
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:29,564
I'm a squatter in my own house.

313
00:42:29,731 --> 00:42:32,066
This roof could
fall in any minute.

314
00:42:32,234 --> 00:42:34,110
Understand now?

315
00:42:35,571 --> 00:42:37,905
I hear you're doing well.

316
00:42:38,448 --> 00:42:40,449
Good career.

317
00:42:40,993 --> 00:42:43,661
You have a bright future.

318
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:49,500
I've lost everything.
Everything.

319
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:52,378
Madam. Don't call me "madam."

320
00:42:52,546 --> 00:42:53,671
Madam.

321
00:42:56,717 --> 00:43:00,177
- Mrs. Liao.
- I'm not Mrs. Liao anymore!

322
00:43:01,096 --> 00:43:04,140
When I had money,
I was Mrs. Liao.

323
00:43:04,308 --> 00:43:08,394
Now I'm just a ghost!

324
00:43:13,275 --> 00:43:15,953
Today the stock market
hit a new low due to

325
00:43:15,966 --> 00:43:18,654
the liquidation of
Peregrine investments.

326
00:43:19,948 --> 00:43:23,451
Why did you invest everything
in the stock market?

327
00:43:23,619 --> 00:43:26,537
You're losing all of our money.

328
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:31,250
Do they ever stop?

329
00:43:34,129 --> 00:43:39,884
Since May '97, major indices
have been in a free fall.

330
00:43:40,052 --> 00:43:43,012
We haven't paid our
bills in three months!

331
00:43:43,847 --> 00:43:46,974
I'm losing patience with you!
Stop now!

332
00:43:47,851 --> 00:43:50,561
I can't take this. I'm leaving!

333
00:44:21,593 --> 00:44:23,219
Dad.

334
00:44:27,307 --> 00:44:29,767
The market goes up and down.

335
00:44:29,935 --> 00:44:32,436
Up, down, up, down.

336
00:44:35,607 --> 00:44:37,441
Yes, it does.

337
00:44:37,609 --> 00:44:40,027
It'll come back, you'll see.

338
00:45:26,158 --> 00:45:28,993
Mrs. Liao, I'm sorry
for your loss.

339
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:32,288
Thank you for coming.

340
00:45:33,665 --> 00:45:39,128
I didn't expect him to
pass away so suddenly.

341
00:45:40,255 --> 00:45:42,548
And to do this in his own home?

342
00:45:46,011 --> 00:45:49,680
His daughter won't speak to me.

343
00:45:49,848 --> 00:45:54,059
She isn't even studying for
the college entrance exam.

344
00:45:55,103 --> 00:45:58,981
If she fails, I'm sending
her back to Korea.

345
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:32,932
Nina, I feel sick. I have
to go to the bathroom.

346
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:35,684
What? There's no time. Quickly.

347
00:46:36,645 --> 00:46:38,437
Hold this. Let's go.
There's no time.

348
00:46:38,605 --> 00:46:40,147
I'll be right back.

349
00:46:40,315 --> 00:46:42,316
Sophia.

350
00:47:17,936 --> 00:47:20,771
Sophia Liao.

351
00:47:37,372 --> 00:47:40,499
It's still too loud here.
You can't hear? Okay.

352
00:47:40,667 --> 00:47:41,959
Over there. Let's go inside.

353
00:47:42,127 --> 00:47:43,460
Here.

354
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:50,634
What did you wanna say? I still
don't understand why you did it.

355
00:47:52,596 --> 00:47:55,598
I didn't know what I was doing.
I just did it.

356
00:47:55,765 --> 00:47:58,559
You thought I couldn't
pass my exam?

357
00:47:59,561 --> 00:48:01,645
I feel bad.

358
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:03,564
It's gonna be all right.

359
00:48:12,115 --> 00:48:14,158
What about you?

360
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:18,454
Don't worry about me. Let's go.

361
00:48:30,467 --> 00:48:32,009
Who's there?

362
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,346
I'm coming.

363
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:41,352
Does Nina Wei live here?

364
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,062
Yes.

365
00:48:56,618 --> 00:48:59,203
Shanghai Education Board
Disciplinary Notice

366
00:48:59,371 --> 00:49:01,121
Nina!

367
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:06,377
Have you nothing to say?

368
00:49:07,671 --> 00:49:13,008
How could you take the
exam for someone else?

369
00:49:13,677 --> 00:49:15,678
Look at me!

370
00:49:15,845 --> 00:49:20,182
Do you know how hard
your father and I work..

371
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:23,310
to give you the best education?

372
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,942
And this is how you
show your gratitude?

373
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:34,071
Three years. You can't retake
the exam for three years.

374
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:36,198
Do you realize what you've done?

375
00:49:36,825 --> 00:49:41,578
You've not only
ruined your future..

376
00:49:41,746 --> 00:49:44,248
but ours too.

377
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,544
You have destroyed our family!

378
00:50:23,955 --> 00:50:25,622
Dear Sophia:

379
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:30,210
By the time you read this
letter, you'll be in Korea.

380
00:50:30,378 --> 00:50:34,256
I did what I did because I
wanted you to be happy.

381
00:50:34,424 --> 00:50:37,468
Because I wanted
us to be together.

382
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:40,471
And look what happened.

383
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:43,474
We're both being punished.

384
00:50:43,933 --> 00:50:47,436
I don't expect my parents
to understand what I did.

385
00:50:47,604 --> 00:50:50,814
But I'm going to make
them proud of me again.

386
00:50:51,608 --> 00:50:54,318
I miss you. I love you.

387
00:50:54,486 --> 00:50:55,486
Nina.

388
00:50:55,653 --> 00:50:57,029
May I have your order?

389
00:50:57,197 --> 00:51:01,325
Yes. I would like a Caesar salad
and T-bone steak, please.

390
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,362
Hi. Hi.

391
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,281
Miss Wei? Hi. Nice to meet you.

392
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:43,158
Nice to meet you. Sebastian Wu.

393
00:51:47,205 --> 00:51:50,332
Hey. It's 9:00.

394
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,000
You should get home.

395
00:51:52,168 --> 00:51:54,795
Yeah. I'm almost done.

396
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:59,508
Okay. Good night. Bye.

397
00:52:48,057 --> 00:52:55,022
We have lived through years
of separation and turmoil.

398
00:52:55,648 --> 00:52:59,443
I can still feel your
heart in your words.

399
00:52:59,611 --> 00:53:04,031
I am happy we will
be together soon.

400
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:13,207
Lily.

401
00:53:14,584 --> 00:53:19,630
Snow Flower.

402
00:53:23,009 --> 00:53:26,261
Come inside. Meet my children.

403
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:48,075
You live here?

404
00:53:51,371 --> 00:53:56,708
If not for your perfect
feet and good marriage..

405
00:53:56,876 --> 00:53:58,794
I would not even be here.

406
00:54:01,339 --> 00:54:03,173
The matchmaker did her best.

407
00:54:04,175 --> 00:54:05,175
She did.

408
00:54:13,184 --> 00:54:14,685
What does your husband do?

409
00:54:17,063 --> 00:54:18,146
Butcher.

410
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:22,085
I would like to spend more
time with my laotong tonight.

411
00:55:22,253 --> 00:55:25,589
No, I want you to
come to bed with me.

412
00:57:43,769 --> 00:57:45,395
The Taiping rebels are coming!

413
00:57:47,064 --> 00:57:49,691
What is happening? The
rebellion is here.

414
00:57:49,859 --> 00:57:51,610
What rebellion?

415
00:57:52,153 --> 00:57:54,321
There is no time to explain.

416
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:57,532
Your mother will not come out.

417
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,618
I will get her.

418
00:57:59,785 --> 00:58:01,661
Are you leaving too?

419
00:58:06,459 --> 00:58:08,585
Snow Flower, I
cannot leave here.

420
00:58:08,753 --> 00:58:10,128
We have no time.

421
00:58:10,296 --> 00:58:12,672
We all have to leave.

422
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,288
I should stay here. My
husband will find me.

423
00:58:14,301 --> 00:58:15,759
It is time to go.

424
00:58:15,927 --> 00:58:17,636
I will not go.

425
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:20,138
I cannot.

426
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,433
Put me down. I cannot go.

427
00:58:41,744 --> 00:58:44,538
The cart broke! Get off!

428
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:49,125
Get the children.

429
00:59:02,765 --> 00:59:05,809
You can rest soon.
It is over here.

430
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:17,153
Lay her down here.

431
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:31,626
I will go fetch the cow.

432
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:34,337
Do not worry. I
will return soon.

433
00:59:34,505 --> 00:59:36,673
I am coming with you.

434
00:59:38,092 --> 00:59:40,510
You take care of your mama.

435
00:59:52,523 --> 00:59:56,192
Are you all right? I am fine.

436
01:00:14,253 --> 01:00:18,548
How are your feet?
They are fine.

437
01:02:24,675 --> 01:02:26,843
My son!

438
01:02:37,605 --> 01:02:40,273
My son! My son!

439
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:04,667
Nina, it's me.

440
01:05:04,835 --> 01:05:09,672
I don't have Sophia's address yet, but I
have found out Arthur is in Shanghai..

441
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:14,135
and has just opened a trendy
nightclub called Club Upside-Down.

442
01:05:14,303 --> 01:05:17,096
I'll text you the details later.

443
01:05:40,871 --> 01:05:43,373
Let this groove get you to move

444
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:47,835
It's all right, all
right, all right

445
01:05:48,504 --> 01:05:51,089
Let this groove
light up your fuse

446
01:05:51,256 --> 01:05:56,135
So stand up, all
right, all right

447
01:05:56,303 --> 01:05:58,262
Gonna tell you what you can do

448
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:00,223
Excuse me.

449
01:06:08,357 --> 01:06:11,442
You know, this room actually works
better when you're drinking.

450
01:06:15,948 --> 01:06:17,991
Why are you here, Nina?

451
01:06:22,955 --> 01:06:24,038
Is she all right?

452
01:06:34,299 --> 01:06:35,967
She's here.

453
01:06:37,594 --> 01:06:39,971
Do you mind if I see her alone?

454
01:07:24,099 --> 01:07:25,975
There, see? See the guy?

455
01:07:30,314 --> 01:07:32,774
I've never seen this before.

456
01:07:32,941 --> 01:07:36,110
Something on your chest.

457
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:41,491
Aah!

458
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:51,334
So? They loved the whole idea.

459
01:07:51,835 --> 01:07:53,920
They're gonna open an
office in New York.

460
01:07:54,088 --> 01:07:55,755
We did it. We did it.

461
01:07:57,841 --> 01:07:59,926
I'd like you to come with me.

462
01:08:01,428 --> 01:08:02,678
Wow.

463
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:06,682
Thank you.

464
01:08:09,394 --> 01:08:12,021
There you go. Two
Brain Hemorrhages.

465
01:08:53,522 --> 01:08:56,149
Finally, your dream
is coming true.

466
01:08:56,316 --> 01:09:00,903
Ha, ha. I wouldn't call it a dream.
It's just like an opportunity.

467
01:09:01,321 --> 01:09:02,697
Whatever you call it.

468
01:09:02,865 --> 01:09:06,075
Cheers.

469
01:09:10,038 --> 01:09:11,330
So when do you leave?

470
01:09:12,457 --> 01:09:14,208
I..

471
01:09:14,835 --> 01:09:17,253
I haven't decided if I'm going.

472
01:09:17,921 --> 01:09:20,423
What? What do you mean?

473
01:09:22,634 --> 01:09:24,677
Actually, I..

474
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:27,096
I worry about you.

475
01:09:29,349 --> 01:09:32,810
Don't worry about me.
I'll be okay.

476
01:09:32,978 --> 01:09:34,604
I'm writing a book.

477
01:09:34,771 --> 01:09:38,733
It's about laotong, the old days,
but I think it's really about us.

478
01:09:38,901 --> 01:09:41,819
When I finish it, I
want you to read it.

479
01:09:41,987 --> 01:09:43,029
That's nice.

480
01:09:43,197 --> 01:09:47,450
But writing a book won't pay the
rent unless you get it published.

481
01:09:47,618 --> 01:09:48,868
I have a new boyfriend.

482
01:09:49,036 --> 01:09:51,037
He has a lot of connections
and he can help.

483
01:09:51,205 --> 01:09:54,123
I know these guys of yours.
Don't go there.

484
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:56,792
Come on. This one is different.

485
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,753
I want you to meet him.

486
01:10:07,304 --> 01:10:09,764
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd
like to dedicate a song..

487
01:10:12,267 --> 01:10:18,314
to the most irritating, maddening,
stubborn woman I have ever met.

488
01:10:18,482 --> 01:10:20,942
This song.. Heh-heh-heh.

489
01:10:21,109 --> 01:10:24,654
Yeah, she's actually here.
She knows who she is.

490
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:27,657
I'll keep you guessing for
a little while, though.

491
01:10:29,952 --> 01:10:33,329
This song is about the place I usually
find myself when we're together..

492
01:10:33,497 --> 01:10:36,499
which is begging for a kiss.

493
01:10:36,667 --> 01:10:37,875
Hit it.

494
01:10:38,043 --> 01:10:40,044
Give me just one kiss

495
01:10:40,212 --> 01:10:41,879
Just yes or no

496
01:10:42,047 --> 01:10:43,422
All right, here we go.

497
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:48,636
A kiss on my cheeks
Leaving a mark of love

498
01:10:48,804 --> 01:10:51,013
Give me just one kiss

499
01:10:51,181 --> 01:10:52,848
Just yes or no

500
01:10:53,016 --> 01:10:54,392
Excuse me there.

501
01:10:54,559 --> 01:10:58,187
A kiss in my heart
Makes me miss you so

502
01:10:58,355 --> 01:11:00,940
Here we go, everybody, ready?

503
01:11:32,764 --> 01:11:35,224
See how she teases me?

504
01:11:52,826 --> 01:11:54,076
Aww.

505
01:12:01,293 --> 01:12:04,920
Yes, ladies and gentlemen.
We're up.

506
01:12:49,132 --> 01:12:51,509
What a surprise.

507
01:12:54,971 --> 01:12:56,722
He's a surprising guy.

508
01:12:56,890 --> 01:12:58,891
What does he do, exactly?

509
01:12:59,059 --> 01:13:02,561
Well, he's an Australian
businessman..

510
01:13:02,729 --> 01:13:05,731
and he owns a bunch
of clubs in Shanghai.

511
01:13:05,899 --> 01:13:08,192
Great. He sounds wonderful.

512
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:13,906
And he's opening his new club in Sydney,
and he wants me to go there with him.

513
01:13:14,074 --> 01:13:15,574
We are leaving soon.

514
01:13:15,742 --> 01:13:17,576
What?

515
01:13:17,744 --> 01:13:19,078
You're leaving with him?

516
01:13:19,246 --> 01:13:21,914
To Sydney? Yes.

517
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:24,792
How long have you known him?

518
01:13:26,586 --> 01:13:29,004
And you've decided
to go with him?

519
01:13:29,172 --> 01:13:30,756
I've known you for so long.

520
01:13:30,924 --> 01:13:34,510
I've been so worried about you.
So stupid of me.

521
01:13:34,678 --> 01:13:37,513
Did I ask you to worry about me?

522
01:13:37,681 --> 01:13:39,723
How can you talk to
me like that, Sophia?

523
01:13:39,891 --> 01:13:42,143
I just wanna tell you,
he's not right for you.

524
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:43,978
How do you know?

525
01:13:48,567 --> 01:13:51,360
So it's all my fault.

526
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:58,367
Okay, fine. I won't
bother you anymore.

527
01:13:59,035 --> 01:14:02,037
I'm going to New York. Good.

528
01:14:26,897 --> 01:14:29,982
He will not tell me where
our son is buried.

529
01:14:37,407 --> 01:14:40,743
My husband takes his sadness
and stuffs it into his fists.

530
01:14:47,417 --> 01:14:53,339
So much has happened in
the years we were apart.

531
01:14:56,009 --> 01:15:02,223
Fate has taught me that I
am just another woman.

532
01:15:04,643 --> 01:15:07,394
I hope when I am reunited
with my husband..

533
01:15:09,397 --> 01:15:11,774
I will be a better wife.

534
01:15:19,074 --> 01:15:21,450
There is no purer
ambition for a woman.

535
01:15:24,996 --> 01:15:27,623
I am happy you think so.

536
01:15:31,044 --> 01:15:33,629
If I can change my fate..

537
01:15:34,005 --> 01:15:36,006
so can you.

538
01:15:37,926 --> 01:15:40,302
You think these
bruises are my fault?

539
01:15:43,557 --> 01:15:45,849
I do not want you to suffer.

540
01:15:48,228 --> 01:15:52,648
My relationship is different but
has something very important.

541
01:15:55,652 --> 01:15:57,444
What is so important?

542
01:16:02,242 --> 01:16:03,784
Lily.

543
01:16:05,787 --> 01:16:11,333
Has your revered husband never
shown you that he loves you?

544
01:16:18,466 --> 01:16:21,385
I seek only to help you
through this difficult time.

545
01:16:21,803 --> 01:16:24,638
Our fates are so different.

546
01:16:24,806 --> 01:16:28,142
I have felt your pity since
you first came into my home.

547
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:31,353
I feel pain in my heart
for you, Snow Flower.

548
01:16:31,521 --> 01:16:33,105
He is my husband, Lily.

549
01:16:33,315 --> 01:16:35,190
I love him.

550
01:16:40,071 --> 01:16:41,864
Lily.

551
01:16:45,118 --> 01:16:48,537
There are things about
men you will never know.

552
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:54,376
These are matters you
do not understand.

553
01:16:56,463 --> 01:16:58,464
You are my laotong.

554
01:16:58,632 --> 01:17:01,050
Everything I have is yours.

555
01:17:01,217 --> 01:17:03,677
The rebels have been stopped.

556
01:17:06,056 --> 01:17:08,349
Come to Tongkou.

557
01:17:09,517 --> 01:17:14,980
Let me take care of
you and the children.

558
01:17:19,069 --> 01:17:21,320
Come with me.

559
01:17:51,393 --> 01:17:52,935
I do not understand.

560
01:17:53,103 --> 01:17:55,270
If I give this
message to Lady Lu..

561
01:17:56,773 --> 01:17:59,066
she will misunderstand
your meaning.

562
01:17:59,234 --> 01:18:01,902
Your bond may be broken forever.

563
01:18:03,863 --> 01:18:06,198
This is my intention.

564
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:17,501
My sister is at a different
station in her life.

565
01:18:20,588 --> 01:18:23,716
I have become a burden to her.

566
01:18:25,301 --> 01:18:28,429
She is far too stubborn
and loyal to accept this.

567
01:18:28,930 --> 01:18:31,473
What you are about to do
will break her heart.

568
01:18:31,641 --> 01:18:34,226
And mine, but it
will set her free.

569
01:18:36,271 --> 01:18:39,481
Loving her as I do,
it is the only way.

570
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:58,667
Lady, I am Lotus. I
know who you are.

571
01:18:58,835 --> 01:19:00,085
What do you want?

572
01:19:05,216 --> 01:19:09,178
My sister asked me to
return this to you.

573
01:19:46,883 --> 01:19:49,843
My dear laotong:

574
01:19:51,137 --> 01:19:58,143
My fate has brought me many sorrows.
I cannot be what you wish.

575
01:19:58,311 --> 01:20:05,108
Three sworn sisters in Jintian
have promised to love me as I am.

576
01:20:05,276 --> 01:20:09,863
You need not worry
about me anymore.

577
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:08,463
Burn them.

578
01:21:11,009 --> 01:21:12,634
But..

579
01:21:14,721 --> 01:21:16,054
Burn them.

580
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:18,265
Yes.

581
01:21:50,506 --> 01:21:52,341
Snow Flower is here.

582
01:22:00,516 --> 01:22:03,352
Sorry my sisters and I are late.

583
01:22:03,519 --> 01:22:07,189
I wish you happiness in
your marriage, Cousin Yan.

584
01:22:08,524 --> 01:22:15,197
Thank you for traveling all this way
to celebrate our daughter's wedding.

585
01:24:10,063 --> 01:24:14,441
I finally had to hire a private
detective to find Sophia's address.

586
01:24:14,609 --> 01:24:15,776
Are you serious?

587
01:24:15,943 --> 01:24:18,236
Turns out she rented
a little apartment.

588
01:24:18,404 --> 01:24:21,323
She was holed up there
finishing her novel.

589
01:24:21,491 --> 01:24:24,326
It's near her father's
old bathhouse.

590
01:24:24,994 --> 01:24:26,787
Bathhouse?

591
01:24:26,954 --> 01:24:29,831
Yeah. It's her favorite place.

592
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:35,796
Where her father would go to escape
from his wife and the stock market.

593
01:24:35,963 --> 01:24:41,009
And Sophia would wait for him.
They'd have tea or a meal.

594
01:24:42,053 --> 01:24:43,804
It meant the world to her.

595
01:24:44,388 --> 01:24:46,515
This is the address.

596
01:24:55,858 --> 01:24:59,945
She never had visitors.

597
01:25:01,364 --> 01:25:05,242
And didn't go out often.

598
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:15,752
If you find my rent
money, tell me.

599
01:26:21,277 --> 01:26:23,403
My dear Nina:

600
01:26:24,030 --> 01:26:27,616
I'm writing a letter
I will never send.

601
01:26:27,783 --> 01:26:32,704
But I must tell you the truth,
even if it's only in my heart.

602
01:26:33,915 --> 01:26:36,333
How could you know how I
felt all these years..

603
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:39,127
about what you did for me?

604
01:26:39,295 --> 01:26:42,839
How could I bear
another sacrifice?

605
01:26:43,007 --> 01:26:46,009
Giving up your
future in New York..

606
01:26:46,552 --> 01:26:48,511
and yet..

607
01:26:48,679 --> 01:26:51,932
I knew your love was too strong.

608
01:26:52,099 --> 01:26:56,019
There would be no asking
you to change your mind.

609
01:26:56,187 --> 01:26:58,855
I had to make you hate me.

610
01:26:59,023 --> 01:27:01,024
And so I lied.

611
01:27:01,776 --> 01:27:05,111
I lied about wanting
to move out..

612
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:07,572
needing to be free.

613
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:13,828
The reason I moved to Sydney was
because I was pregnant with Arthur's baby.

614
01:27:14,497 --> 01:27:18,166
But then I guess it
was not meant to be.

615
01:27:42,358 --> 01:27:43,692
I know what you think of me.

616
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:46,486
That..

617
01:27:46,654 --> 01:27:48,905
That I didn't deserve her.

618
01:27:50,908 --> 01:27:53,034
You're right, I didn't.

619
01:27:54,829 --> 01:27:58,707
I mean, when we were
first together..

620
01:27:59,834 --> 01:28:04,504
Sophia would disappear for, I don't
know, a few hours every night.

621
01:28:04,672 --> 01:28:06,381
She'd never tell me
where she'd been.

622
01:28:06,549 --> 01:28:11,469
I assumed she was seeing someone
else, so one night, I followed her.

623
01:28:13,055 --> 01:28:15,098
Where was she going?

624
01:28:15,725 --> 01:28:17,642
To a bathhouse in Luwan.

625
01:28:17,810 --> 01:28:19,811
I mean, the weird thing was..

626
01:28:21,272 --> 01:28:23,273
the bathhouse was
restricted to men only.

627
01:28:23,441 --> 01:28:26,401
She had to disguise
herself to get in there.

628
01:28:27,069 --> 01:28:28,570
Yeah.

629
01:28:29,322 --> 01:28:31,781
She wore a suit, right?

630
01:28:31,949 --> 01:28:33,742
Yeah, why?

631
01:28:35,953 --> 01:28:38,747
It was her father's bathhouse.

632
01:28:39,957 --> 01:28:41,791
Her father's?

633
01:28:52,011 --> 01:28:53,470
Nina.

634
01:28:56,766 --> 01:29:00,185
There's something.. There's
something you should know.

635
01:29:00,353 --> 01:29:02,312
She lost..

636
01:29:03,356 --> 01:29:05,607
She lost your baby.

637
01:30:22,518 --> 01:30:24,477
Excuse me.

638
01:30:24,645 --> 01:30:30,150
My father left something here.

639
01:30:30,317 --> 01:30:33,445
His locker number is 173.

640
01:30:33,612 --> 01:30:35,947
I'm here to get it for him.

641
01:30:36,115 --> 01:30:40,535
We're not open yet.
They're still cleaning.

642
01:30:45,166 --> 01:30:48,460
Old Ding, leave us alone.

643
01:30:48,627 --> 01:30:51,921
This lady has some
business here.

644
01:30:54,216 --> 01:30:55,592
Please be quick.

645
01:30:55,759 --> 01:30:57,469
Thank you.

646
01:32:13,629 --> 01:32:15,380
The end of this story..

647
01:32:15,548 --> 01:32:17,757
is about things of the heart
that will never change.

648
01:32:28,519 --> 01:32:32,313
Madam. What is wrong, child?

649
01:32:33,315 --> 01:32:35,149
My mother is very sick.

650
01:32:38,487 --> 01:32:42,991
She calls for you in her sleep.

651
01:32:50,749 --> 01:32:53,084
But she has other sisters.

652
01:32:53,252 --> 01:32:57,130
She has no other sisters.
She misled you.

653
01:32:58,591 --> 01:33:01,634
She has never had
another laotong.

654
01:33:01,802 --> 01:33:06,806
For 10 years, she was
only their teacher.

655
01:33:07,683 --> 01:33:10,226
She has only one
sister of the heart.

656
01:33:10,978 --> 01:33:15,607
You have to see her
one last time.

657
01:33:18,193 --> 01:33:21,446
I beg you.

658
01:34:01,070 --> 01:34:04,405
I waited for you.

659
01:34:32,893 --> 01:34:37,105
Madam, I brought you
some things from home.

660
01:34:40,859 --> 01:34:42,610
I am sorry.

661
01:34:43,612 --> 01:34:47,949
I knew you could not want
me to destroy the fan.

662
01:35:44,798 --> 01:35:49,260
When Lily returned home after
Snow Flower's funeral..

663
01:35:49,428 --> 01:35:53,890
she looked at the fan and could not
allow things to end as they had.

664
01:35:55,726 --> 01:35:59,520
So she opened a new panel..

665
01:35:59,688 --> 01:36:04,734
dipped her brush, and wrote
a final inscription.

666
01:36:32,763 --> 01:36:35,348
The world is always changing.

667
01:36:35,974 --> 01:36:38,267
Every day it's changing.

668
01:36:38,936 --> 01:36:42,230
Everything in life is changing.

669
01:36:43,732 --> 01:36:48,402
We have to look inside ourselves
to find what stays the same..

670
01:36:48,570 --> 01:36:49,737
such as loyalty..

671
01:36:49,905 --> 01:36:51,572
our shared history..

672
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:53,699
and love for each other.

673
01:36:53,867 --> 01:36:59,080
In them, the truth of
the past lives on.

674
01:36:59,832 --> 01:37:04,335
Now I understand Lily's last
inscription for Snow Flower..

675
01:37:05,045 --> 01:37:12,051
and what it means
for Sophia and me.

676
01:37:18,058 --> 01:37:22,019
My entire life, I
have longed for love.

677
01:37:22,187 --> 01:37:25,481
I always thought I
understood it..

678
01:37:25,649 --> 01:37:30,194
but now I see, with
shame and sorrow..

679
01:37:30,779 --> 01:37:35,449
that I understand nothing
of deep-hearted love.

680
01:37:36,159 --> 01:37:38,744
The love between sisters.

681
01:38:46,939 --> 01:38:51,359
So many years without you.
This is my penance.

682
01:38:51,526 --> 01:38:53,694
If you will come back to me..

683
01:38:53,862 --> 01:38:56,530
I will never leave you.

684
01:38:57,074 --> 01:38:59,033
Never again.

685
01:38:59,826 --> 01:39:05,373
And we will be sisters
for 10,000 years.

686
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:03,000
