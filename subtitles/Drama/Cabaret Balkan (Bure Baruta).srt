Cabaret Balkan

2
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,680
Why are you laughing at me?

3
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,350
You think it's funny?
That I'm different?

4
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,880
That I'm mutilated?

5
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,920
Is that why you have come?

6
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,870
Welcome!

7
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,680
Tonight I will be...

8
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,040
...fucking around with you kids.

9
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,430
Playing

10
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,560
Script

11
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,920
Directed by

12
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,640
Damn this lousy country.
Anyone that had any salt

13
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,680
in his head fled from here.

14
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,960
And you return back?

15
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,040
Do you mind if I smoke?

16
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,720
Smoking kills.

17
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,880
Everything kills over here.
If I was a taxi driver in New York

18
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,960
or Paris, i wouldn't smoke.
Foreing ministers of 15

EU countries,
demanded from

20
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,160
president Milosevic

21
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,120
to stop the violence in Kosovo.
At the meeting with colleagues

22
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,550
from 12 mediterranean countries...
Look.

23
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,480
They killed a taxi driver yesterday.

24
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,990
He got a bullet in his neck.
So much police!

25
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,160
I have no idea what they're doing.

26
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,560
Look at this lunatic!
Who gave you 

27
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,680
a driver's license?

28
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:18,520
Faggot!
What should i do with him?

29
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,360
Should I kill him?

30
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,280
Come in! Come and get warm.
I'll take you to heaven,

31
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,480
baby.

32
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,480
Come, baby.

33
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,640
Let's go to heaven!

34
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,680
Good evening.
There's no problem!

35
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,240
You can talk.

36
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,470
I'm really sorry.
Let's not cause problems.

37
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,120
I don't have a driver's license.

38
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,720
Open!

39
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,640
Fuck it all.

40
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,630
Out!

41
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,350
Get out!

42
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,790
Get out you monkey!

43
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,470
Out!

44
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,830
What is happening here?

45
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,950
This cunt fucked up my car!

46
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,280
Calm down.
Sir, please be nice

47
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,790
and step out of your car.

48
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,550
He doesn't have driver's license.

49
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,080
Get out if I tell you so.
I don't have a driver's license.

50
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,440
I only have the car registration.

51
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,840
Will you get out?
Will you go alone

52
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,790
or do I have to pull you out?
Get him out,

53
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,240
or I will.
Get out,

54
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,070
you fucking cunt! Out!
I have a solution. Break the glass

55
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,320
and pull him out from front.

56
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,030
Calm down sir.

57
00:07:34,720 --> 00:08:05,680
He got away!
Does he live here?

58
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,400
Viktorovic?
I don't know. We're from Bosnia,

59
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,400
they gave us this garage.
Temporarily. There's no water

60
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,080
and they cut off electricity.
I'm not asking about the electricity,

61
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,800
but about Viktorovic.
The one that has that

62
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,280
idiot son, Aca.
I've found it. Apartement 13.

63
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,760
Third floor.

64
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,110
Have you come to register the refugees?

65
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,590
Don't nag, woman!

66
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,360
Did you remember how he looked?
When i see him, he wont look anymore

67
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,880
like he did as I remember him.

68
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,430
Calm down please.

69
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,360
Don't interfere please.

70
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,790
Here you go.

71
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,280
Good evening. - Good evening.

72
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,840
Is Aco here?

73
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,280
Aleksander is not at home.

74
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,000
Where is he?

75
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,920
I don't know. He went out
We'll wait.

76
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,800
-God knows when he'll be back.

77
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,920
We're in no hurry.

78
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,360
Can i help you? -No.
Would you like some coffee?

79
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,280
-I'd rather have some liquer. Jovo?

80
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,280
Liquer will be fine.

81
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,680
Liquer it is.

82
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,640
Just a moment.

83
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:32,840
Here you go.
To us!

84
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,200
-Cheers!

85
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,550
How old is Aco?

86
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,070
Aleksander? 18. Almost 18.

87
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,040
The worst years.

88
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,400
Homemade? -Yes. -Bravo.

89
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,880
Did Aco tell you?

90
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,000
Good, we can settle this.

91
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,280
What should we settle?
Some things

92
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,200
cannot be settled.

93
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,280
I've been driving for 31 years.
At 12

94
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,440
I nicked my dad's car.
Until now I have

95
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,350
never let a single scratch on it. Until now!
It's as it was new.

96
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,120
Better said, it was.

97
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,440
It's better then a new one.
I took from my mouth.

98
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,040
Sveto knows.
We'll settle everything,

99
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,510
Mr.... -Jovan.
Aco!

100
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,920
-Jovo! Calm down.

101
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,360
Aco!

102
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,430
Aco, come out!
Please don't, Jovo.

103
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,720
-It's ok. It's ok.

104
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,840
Good evening.

105
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,200
Open!
Where are you Aco?

106
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,920
Are you hiding? Running?
Please Sir.

107
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:05,430
Mr Jovan, please.
Why are you running?

108
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,470
Why are you hiding?

109
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,390
I was afraid. -Of me?
He broke my car window.

110
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,920
I was scared shitless.

111
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,790
Did you see my car?
It's falling apart.

112
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,080
It's no biggie.
What's is falling apart? I'll show you...

113
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,920
-Jovan! -Go away, Sveto!

114
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,800
You shouldn't have ran away.
You should have let the police,

115
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,230
make a report.

116
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,990
That's right.

117
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,080
The policeman came.
I showed him my 

118
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,870
car registration.
Then he started screaming,

119
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,440
that he'll pull me out.
He started jumping on the lid

120
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,760
and that's why I ran away.
You ran like a pussy. If you don't have 

121
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,880
a driver's license, you have your eyes at least!
You can see where you drive.

122
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,920
Do you have brains in your head?
Do you know the traffic signs?

123
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,750
You almost killed me!
He steps on the accelerator

124
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,630
and he doesn't care shit.
I guard him like the apple of my eye.

125
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,230
Stevo, it can go up to 140 on open.
120. -140. -120 engraved.

126
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,950
-I said 140.
What is it, why are you looking at me?

127
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,840
What will we do now?
Answer Mr. Jovan.

128
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,030
Why are you looking at me?
Monkey! Do you have any idea,

129
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,120
what you have done?
You fucked up my car!

130
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,990
You fucked up your car!
You fucked up this apartment.

131
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,360
Look!
You're locking yourself.

132
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,480
-Everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine.

133
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,040
-It won't!

134
00:14:48,120 --> 00:15:05,600
Let me be...
You're mine, Aco!

135
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,280
Sooner or later.

136
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,840
These people aren't normal.

137
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,640
They're partying again.

138
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,440
And you? Where are you going?
That's my business.

139
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,920
-That is our business.
Till I feed you,

140
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,670
it is our business!

141
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,480
Listen dad, I'm in a hurry.
There's no hurry.

142
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,150
Sit down!

143
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,560
I asked where you were going.

144
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,880
I have some business to do.
What business? Aren't you a bit

145
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,350
tired? Haven't you worked too much?
Go visit my boss tomorrow

146
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,440
and tell him, whose son you are.
Listen old man,

147
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,120
Such work is not for me.

148
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,720
What is good for you then? Balet?
Go there

149
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,240
and dont disgrace me.
Half of the country is unemployed.

150
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,750
People would kill for such a job,
yet you say it's not good for you.

151
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,680
What's good for you then? -I don't know.

152
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,960
Urban transport certainly ain't for me.
You're a professor and you drive a bus.

153
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,640
How can you do that?
I can.

154
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,550
Do I steal? Do I beg?

155
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,640
Are you listening to me?
Can't we have a

156
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,240
single evening without screaming?
How can I put her to sleep now?

157
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,910
How?

158
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,800
Leave me alone.

159
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,400
Sister, sister.
It's not my fault,

160
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,960
if Mujo left you.
He didn't leave me.

161
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,870
He had to.

162
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,040
Why are you looking at me?

163
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,670
Where is my cap?
You can't find your cap?

164
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,720
The cap is all that matters to you.
Everything will be fine,

165
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,920
we just have to find the cap.
We don't have anything,

166
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,400
and he's missing a cap.

167
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,670
You're a bit lacking under you cap.
Everyone else seems to find their way around.

168
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,190
-They find their way around? -Look at us.

169
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,200
I can see how they find their way around.
I'd rather be a bus driver

170
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,920
then a thief and a criminal.

171
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,120
Coffee? -Double.

172
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,750
I have to stay awake.

173
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,350
Night shift is killing me.

174
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,320
We're even out of gas.

175
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,950
Baby! Beer.

176
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,470
Give me two beers.

177
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,880
How are you Dimitrij?

178
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,390
I am good thank God.

179
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,840
Will you have anything to drink?

180
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,720
I've ordered beer.

181
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:32,390
Do you remember me? -No.
What happened to you?

182
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,190
I can't seem to remember you this way.

183
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,480
Don't ask.

184
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,680
Did you have an accident?

185
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:49,520
If only I had one.
Cheers.

186
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,950
-Cheers!
Did you have 

187
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,080
a car accident?

188
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,440
Did you fall down? -No.

189
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,720
I didn't.

190
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,310
Did someone beat you up?

191
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,750
Yes.

192
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,600
Who?
He'll be damned,

193
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,070
when I find him.

194
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,120
Don't you remember?

195
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,790
I didn't see him.
He slapped something on

196
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,670
your head, didn't he?

197
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,000
Yes.

198
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,950
How did you know?
You had a dirty business,

199
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,360
Dimitrij. Dirty.

200
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,030
Well you know...
When we start beating up policemen,

201
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,840
everything gets fucked up.

202
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:08,400
Fucked up for good.
How many are you?

203
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,240
60.000, 100.000?
A lot of you

204
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,880
for a city of million?
Too many. -Not enough.

205
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,830
-What's not enough? -You can see.

206
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,680
He wore you out good.

207
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,190
Somebody really doesn't like you.

208
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,790
They killed the God in you.

209
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,710
With a pole. -A pole?

210
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,350
And a hammer.
A pole and a hammer.

211
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,870
Bone by one.
The hammer weighed

212
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,800
7 or 8 kg.

213
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,640
Every single bone.

214
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,640
27 broken bones.
Three compound fractures.

215
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,800
All the ribs broken.
Broken skull.

216
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,360
Backbone injured.

217
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,720
That's not possible.
They put me together,

218
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,350
but not good enough.

219
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,440
I'm not satisfied.

220
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:34,910
They took one of my kidneys.
And the other one sometime works,

221
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,990
sometimes not.

222
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,110
You shouldn't drink at all.

223
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,880
But I drink.

224
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,510
I don't hold water at night.

225
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,710
As soon as I fall asleep,

226
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,360
I piss myself.

227
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,230
God damn him.
I would be better off,

228
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,600
If i was ran over by a truck.

229
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,400
Bad.

230
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,310
Really bad.

231
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,670
How will I manage?
Early retirement,

232
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,880
with no awards and medals.
I'm not complaining.

233
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,320
I've survived my own.
And as they say,

234
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,080
oldness - sadness.
I don't need anything else.

235
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,430
Ask for Dimitrij!

236
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,480
I've broken bones of hooligans .

237
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,520
How many women have i fucked!
I can't even count them.

238
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,670
And I still can do it.

239
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:29,680
Can't I, honey?
Do you know you beat you up?

240
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,390
-Who? Who?

241
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,160
I did.

242
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,870
You're joking. -With a pole.

243
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,750
And a 9 kg hammer.
I thought,

244
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,590
I broke 32 of your bones.
You didn't resist.

245
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,440
-You're lying.

246
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,720
You squealed like a pig.

247
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:03,310
Do you remember now? -Leave me alone!
You found me in the car 

248
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,830
with my girlfriend. -I don't' remember.
You pulled me out and...

249
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,230
-I don't remember.
You fucked my mother!

250
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,360
-It hurts! Hurts!

251
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,200
Why? - I don't know.

252
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,760
For nothing, Dimitrij!
You hit me with a truncheon between my legs.

253
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,680
Between my legs!
What did I do to you?

254
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,270
-I don't know.

255
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,560
I reported you,
but nothing happened,

256
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,750
because you were a big shot.
I lied for 2 days

257
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,590
in bed.
The third day I got up, but i

258
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,120
fell back into bed.
My balls were as

259
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,910
big as a watermellon.
I didn't even dare think about

260
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,120
a woman.
It hurts,

261
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,430
everytime I get an erection.

262
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,750
Can you fuck now?

263
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,070
I can't have children.

264
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,320
Will you have beer?

265
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,440
I'm paying now.

266
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,830
Why ? Tell me.

267
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,680
Why?

268
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,920
Why?

269
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,670
Where are you?

270
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,880
Where?

271
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,640
Who are you?

272
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,030
What?

273
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:32,270
Come. Come here.

274
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,960
Slowly. Slowly.

275
00:29:52,560 --> 00:30:15,240
It's only recreation.
I promised to take care of

276
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,590
Jelena, when you were in army.

277
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,310
Which Jelena?

278
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,960
Which? Your Jelena.

279
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,800
I didn't take care of her.

280
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,830
I fucked her.

281
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,720
I had to tell you.

282
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,360
This has lied heavy on my soul for 20 years.

283
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,910
Today i made a decision.

284
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:59,280
Aren't you angry?
At you? Do you have 

285
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,520
a better friend then me?

286
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,550
I don't.

287
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,400
Who fucks Jelena?

288
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:55,320
They're only women. Isn't it so?
Who got you your

289
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,870
first woman?

290
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,030
Who taught you how to play cards?

291
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:12,710
Who bought you your first record?
Who smuggled you every weekend

292
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,560
from the barracks?
Who put sugar

293
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,720
in your vans tank?

294
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,400
Who?

295
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,350
I did.

296
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,120
You.
Who got you

297
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,430
your garage?

298
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,920
Who?

299
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,160
I did.

300
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,920
Who poisoned your Lesika?

301
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,520
You poisoned Lesika?
We bought her together.

302
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,480
You trained her.

303
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,840
How did you poison her?

304
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,600
With poison.

305
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,390
You be damned.

306
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,950
Cheers.

307
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,760
Cheers.

308
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,150
I have a hard time telling you this,
but your wife

309
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,640
has a lover.

310
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,790
What?

311
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,040
You fuck Svetlana?

312
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,440
I used to, not any more.

313
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,510
You must have quarreled.

314
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,950
So?

315
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,200
Crush my head.

316
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,480
Yours?

317
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,950
Cheers.

318
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,800
Cheers.

319
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,720
Any more of it?

320
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,160
Your son...

321
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,840
What? He doesn't look like me?

322
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,320
No.

323
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,160
What shall I tell you?

324
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,280
Nothing. Hit me.

325
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,080
You?

326
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,280
I can't.

327
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,070
I knew about Jelena.

328
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,800
You knew?
I knew,

329
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,670
you would tell me someday about it.

330
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,280
It's funny to you.

331
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,430
To me it's horrible, kids.

332
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,960
Will you be nice to me?

333
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,200
Will you kiss me?

334
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,790
Of course you would like to take it from behind,

335
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,000
my Balkan swines!

336
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,990
I'm an honest son of a bitch.

337
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:56,270
Our virgin.
Like a swine I 

338
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,110
drag my heavy brain.
I am 

339
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,910
one complicated son of a bitch.

340
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,440
I don't give a damn!
That's knowledge and magic,

341
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,590
experience and fantasy.
I know the signs, codes, state

342
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,520
secrets, nature's alchemy.
I could harly find you

343
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,720
burek at this time of hour.

344
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,800
Don't you have small change?
I know all the main figures in Europe

345
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,880
and the gravediggers,
Worms where there is chaos.

346
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,880
Ghettos of paranoia,
hermetic circles,

347
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,670
exoteric circles.
Chiromancies, schizomanias,

348
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,510
necromancies, metapomanthies...

349
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,200
How boring, kids.

350
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,680
Ethnic tension.

351
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,030
Civil war.

352
00:39:53,480 --> 00:40:00,190
Fratricidal war.
If you have a gapin wound, you should 

353
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,560
pour boiling lead into it.
Don't wait for me to do it.

354
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,480
Don't be sorry about anyone.
If you feel sorry for anyone,

355
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,880
fuck him up until he dies.
Because death is beautiful

356
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,840
and the world is absurd.
Politics is insanity.

357
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:28,070
And I'm talking bullshit.
I rather sit in my spot

358
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,000
and drink.
Look at the sunset

359
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,470
in Dorcol.

360
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,560
I don't want to lift a finger.

361
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,590
That's all.

362
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,550
Mane, don't be full of it.

363
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,560
Why did you come?

364
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,070
I came to visit you.

365
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,630
To see how you're doing.

366
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,430
And how am I doing?

367
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,830
How are you?

368
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,440
Excellent, thank you.

369
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,280
And it will be even better.

370
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,360
And you?

371
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:27,430
How are you doing abroad?
I came foremost,

372
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,520
to see Natalija.

373
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,350
Leave my sister alone.

374
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,000
I want to put right everything.

375
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,080
You haven't dropped in for 5 years.
I had to return as 

376
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,590
a succesful man,
with money in my pocket.

377
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,680
I had to leave this shit.

378
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,640
It's too late.

379
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,280
What is too late?

380
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,910
Should I die here?
To lose my life

381
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,470
because of some fucking politicians,
that fuck you in your head,

382
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,200
and you keep silent?

383
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,640
That's true.
What's up with you?

384
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,520
I only have one life.

385
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,120
You're right, Mane.

386
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I have to see her.
You've caused enough problems already.

387
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,430
-I know.

388
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,750
What do you know?
I know they threw her out

389
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,160
of the orchestra.

390
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:29,270
That's all you know?
I have to see her.

391
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,360
-I always knew more then you.

392
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,280
I have to see her tonight.

393
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,150
There's no light, Mane.

394
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,680
There's only candles burning

395
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:59,200
in this country.
You screwed,

396
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,600
for coming back.

397
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,800
I screwed myself too.

398
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:22,840
We're all screwed.
Should I drive all night in circles

399
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,310
do you know where you would like to go?

400
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,910
You just drive.

401
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,920
Drive.

402
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,800
Fuck! There's a million marks here.

403
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:07,070
Not a million. Several millions!
Some millions for you,

404
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,430
some millions for me.

405
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,480
You're full of it!
Do you know whose it is?

406
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,960
-I don't know.

407
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,960
Why are you then so full of it?
You musn't know for whom

408
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:22,030
we work, so don't shit around.
Topi, what shall I do?

409
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,320
-Don't cock around.
The guy in front of you

410
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,080
cocked around,
and I bit off his entire ear.

411
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,880
He yelled like Van Gogh.

412
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,920
Sit.

413
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,360
I saved this for you.

414
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:46,870
Thank you, Topi, thank you.
Did you hear about the situation over here?

415
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,360
It's much worse.
You've come to the wrong place

416
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,280
at the wrong time.
Knowing the circumstances 

417
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,400
of Kozaracko kolo from '68...
We are from Kozara, Topi.

418
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,040
-No shit.
I've come to the conclusion,

419
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,720
that this is a special place. Right?

420
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,640
Right.

421
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,760
Everbody wants to get out of here.
But the Balkan is a barrel of gunpowder.

422
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,560
-That's very true.
Figuratively speaking,

423
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:21,640
Balkan is behind the worlds ass.
I call that the hemorrhoids

424
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,280
on the worlds ass.
Working title:

425
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,640
Pretty bleedy.
Subtitle: You're fucked

426
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,270
by me and people like me.

427
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,840
Why you?

428
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,950
Don't cock around.

429
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,470
Here, try.

430
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:56,150
It smells money and death.
You don't understand anything,

431
00:45:57,880 --> 00:47:14,110
you forsaken son.
You mind if i smoke?

432
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,680
-No.

433
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,680
Do you smoke? -No, no.
Don't we know each other

434
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,840
from somewhere? -No.

435
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,270
You don't remember me? -No.
Didn't we meet somewhere?

436
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,640
Maybe on the train?

437
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:55,070
No we didn't.
You drink?

438
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,280
-No, thanks.

439
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:02,230
You don't even drink. -No.

440
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,040
You will drink now!

441
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,360
Is there a special reason?

442
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,120
There is. -Really?
The moment I saw you,

443
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,350
I knew.

444
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,110
What did you know?

445
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:32,150
That I will sit opposite to you.

446
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,760
And that we'll drink vodka.

447
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:52,040
Where are you travelling to, boy?

448
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,880
Travel! Get lost.

449
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,040
Cheers.

450
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,910
Cheers.

451
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,200
Where are you headed?

452
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,190
I don't know.

453
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,310
How come you don't know?

454
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,870
I am on a run.

455
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,550
Why?

456
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:07,920
I didn't pay for the parking ticker.
You're lying.

457
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:16,150
-It's true, I'm lying.
I killed

458
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,910
my best friend.

459
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,680
Why?

460
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,390
Because he fucked my wife.

461
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,840
Leave that alone. It's not mine.

462
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,630
Whose is it?

463
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,790
You have beautiful eyes.
I don't trust women

464
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:59,550
with beautiful eyes any more.
The moment I saw you,

465
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,200
I knew.

466
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,790
What did you know?
That I will be sitting right beside you

467
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,280
and it wont be easy.
You decided

468
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:15,040
where to step out, didn't you?

469
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,440
Where will you step out?

470
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:24,360
I don't know. Why?

471
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:44,080
Because I'm going there too.
They should lock you up.

472
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,960
-Certainly, only between your legs.
Leave me alone.

473
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,520
-No way.

474
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,600
Leave me alone!

475
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,840
Good. Ok.

476
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,960
What will we do now?

477
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,470
I don't know.

478
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,190
Where did you get this?

479
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,630
From Marko.

480
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:29,390
Which Marko?
Excuse me,

481
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:58,550
when does the bus leave?
You're asking me?

482
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,070
-Yes, I'm asking you.
It should have left

483
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,480
15 minutes ago.
15 minutes ago?

484
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,120
-Yes.

485
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,120
Where is the driver?
Over there. He'll come.

486
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,840
- I know he'll come, but when?

487
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,310
Believe me I don't know.

488
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,190
What is he doing there?

489
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,640
Probably drinking coffee.

490
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,110
Drinking coffee?

491
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,790
Drinking coffee. He's probably drinking coffee.
The US administration

492
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,680
accused the Bosnian goverment,
of preventing the return of the

493
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:38,150
Serbian and Croatian refugees.
The accusation was made

494
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,600
on a conference in Sarajevo.

495
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,360
He's really drinking coffee.

496
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,910
Fuck this nation!

497
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:55,590
Everyone drinks coffee.
I'll get old before you all

498
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:00,800
drink your coffees.
If I was late,

499
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,160
would he wait for me?
Like hell he would.

500
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:09,110
Wouldn't he madam?
It would be a scandal anywhere else around the world.

501
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,480
Only we have a system like this.
Bravo! Can I ask something?

502
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,080
Did you pay for the ticket?

503
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,440
Excuse me?

504
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,950
Did you pay for the ticket?

505
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:25,030
I have a monthly ticket.
Madam has a monthly ticket.

506
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,040
Can I see it?
I only want to see it

507
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,920
for a moment.

508
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,480
Why all the trouble with the ticket?
The madam has a ticket.

509
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,640
I nice example for all.
You don't need a ticker.

510
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,200
-Why not?

511
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,000
Because there is no driver.
No one drives here.

512
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,960
You don't need a ticker.
The driver doesn't care at all.

513
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,600
He doesn't give a damn. He's drinking coffee.

514
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:47,080
He doesn't give a rat's ass about the bus.
That's why you don't need

515
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,760
this damn ticket.

516
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,600
What would you do with the ticket?

517
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,150
No system - no tickets.
You want me to drive?

518
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,280
Do you?
I'll start the engine and drive us

519
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,880
directly to hell.
I'll set it off

520
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,630
and he'll come immediately.
He drinks coffee

521
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,440
and he doesn't give a shit about us.

522
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,710
They fuck us.

523
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,390
They screwed us.

524
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,030
Isn't it so?

525
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:18,000
That's right.
Do you remember, madam

526
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,350
how it was under the Turks?

527
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,240
How should I know that?
How come you don't know?

528
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,240
We were under Turks for 500 years.
Of course we were,

529
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,720
but i don't know how it was.

530
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,080
But you remember the Germans.

531
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,280
I don't remember the Germans.
You don't even remember the Germans.

532
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,590
You forgot that war too?

533
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,320
That's what it's all about.
Nobody remembers

534
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,280
anything.
You need a new war,

535
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,590
god damn you.
Shut up young man

536
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,840
and bite your tongue.

537
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,240
I should bite my tongue?
I bit off half a woman's tongue.

538
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,520
She deserved it.

539
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,640
How old are you madam?
Excuse me?

540
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,840
-Hundred, aren't you?

541
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,760
Isn't it time for you to die?

542
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:11,990
Young man, calm down.
We're tight.

543
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,880
They propagate too fast.

544
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,080
My God.
Why do you call for God all the time madam?

545
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,000
Are you sick?
You're pale. Maybe you have cancer.

546
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,160
It comes with years.
You should be ashamed. I hope your 

547
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:34,950
tongue dries up, I tell you.
So, madam, I should bite my

548
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,670
tongue or should it dry up?
Do you know what you want?

549
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,430
Does anyone know what they really want?
You have no idea.

550
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:47,630
You're sitting here only for the drive.
Now you're really

551
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,280
going to drive.

552
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,120
Young man, where are you goinig?

553
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,990
To hell, old one.

554
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,520
It works.

555
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,640
It really works.

556
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,000
We're driving.

557
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,080
Stop, god damn you.

558
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,720
Everyone is crazy.

559
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,670
This is crazy!

560
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,400
Drive!

561
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,920
Did you see that?
Good, good.

562
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,670
You just drive.
It isn't the worst,

563
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,240
that could happen.

564
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,680
Fuck it. Bus stop.

565
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,680
Asshole!

566
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:36,200
Madam, madam.

567
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:42,680
Madam, control.

568
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:48,910
Everything will be fine. Don't worry.

569
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,310
I will take you home personally.

570
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,800
No. Please don't.
Please son,

571
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,840
we want to step out.
No problem, mother.

572
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:09,800
- Let me out too.
Slowly, be careful.

573
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,720
Take care. Good night.

574
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,270
Open the middle door, asshole.

575
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:33,760
Open!
Good evening. Do you need anything?

576
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:42,760
-Shame on you.
Is the jacket warm?

577
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,710
-Yes.
Does the wind blow through it?

578
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,270
-No.

579
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:56,390
And the knife...?
Does the knife let through?

580
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,910
-It does.

581
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,160
You two would like to step out too, wouldn't you?

582
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,400
No, no.

583
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:20,630
Good.
Do you get an erection,

584
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:26,960
when you see chicks on the street?
Give him some money.

585
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:30,390
-What do you want? Money?
Are you rich?

586
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,520
-No.
Why are you spending money right and left?

587
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,680
I asked you something else.

588
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,520
You'll pay for this.

589
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:41,880
I'll pay for it?

590
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,230
You're out of your mind.

591
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:50,520
Fuck this nation.
Nobody listens,

592
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,240
to what you say.
Nobody understands,

593
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,440
what they are asked.
Everyone answers

594
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,830
something completely different.

595
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,670
I will kill you all.
I will kill you all.

596
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,400
Not to bat an eyelid.
You just carry on whit you shit.

597
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,640
I have a simple question.
Don't be a wiseguy.

598
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,790
Remember it:
Do you get an erection,

599
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,520
when you look at babes? Now!

600
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,150
No.
Now you're talking. I don't believe you.

601
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,640
Would you like to lick the floor?

602
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,590
No.

603
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,070
Good. Now I believe you.

604
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,350
Wise. The floor is not clean.

605
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,760
Good evening.

606
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,950
Good evening.

607
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,950
Good evening.

608
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:02,360
I've been looking for a button like this for years.

609
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,270
What's your name?

610
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,880
Ana.

611
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,390
Ana. Nice name.

612
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,720
Do you have a boyfriend?

613
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,270
I do.

614
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,150
Is he jealous?

615
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,920
Yes.

616
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:30,480
And you? Do you cheat on him?
Do you like to drag along

617
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,560
with others in dark doorways?

618
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,920
No.

619
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,920
Do you believe her?
I believe her.

620
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:47,950
-Don't interfere.
Why are you being silly?

621
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,630
On spot.

622
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,040
Not city.

623
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,190
You sit here.

624
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:02,680
Ana, spread your legs.
Come on, spread your legs.

625
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,030
Do you hear me?
More. The man is old.

626
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,800
That's right.

627
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,560
Look!

628
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,560
Spread your legs!

629
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,560
Look! Look!

630
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,030
Are you getting a hardon?

631
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,230
You don't have to answer that.

632
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:31,280
But please, don't lie to me.

633
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,560
I don't want to answer.

634
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,510
That's right man, that's the way.

635
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,710
Was it nice for you?

636
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,590
I don't want to answer.

637
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:07,120
Good.
Keep the button

638
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:12,160
in memory of me.
Quiet, you monkey. Don't you see,

639
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:15,680
that I'm talking to the girl?

640
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:28,240
Call me sometime.
Finally you came.

641
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,150
We have been waiting for you.

642
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,070
You will be...

643
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,200
Sonny!

644
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,560
Sonny!

645
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,590
Sonny!

646
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,990
Tonight I will explain you everything.

647
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:24,160
At our spot.
I will, I will.

648
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,720
-Please.
Listen Natalija,

649
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:30,670
come tonight, please.
Just a moment, then...

650
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,080
-On the old spot.

651
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:50,590
Natalija, I beg you.
Is everyone here?

652
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,040
-Everyone.

653
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,870
As agreed.
The rest after the job is done.

654
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,230
-Yes.

655
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,710
Let it have some class.
The Vienna Philharmonic

656
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,000
will envy us.

657
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,440
Right from the balls.

658
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,160
Excuse me?

659
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:13,680
Excuse me?
I mean from the soul.

660
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,550
-Oh, yes.

661
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:39,470
From the soul.
Wait a minute, honey.

662
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:44,470
Something is not quite clear to me.
Did he tell you to spread your 

663
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,430
legs or did you do it yourself?
He ordered me to.

664
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,920
-He. I'm sorry.
And you didn't look at him?

665
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:55,910
-No.
And you have no idea why

666
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,830
he looked at you all the time?

667
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:01,480
I don't know.
He didn't ... -Stop it with

668
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,320
these macedonian jokes.
Why did he look at you?

669
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,120
Only you?

670
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,080
Why didn't he come look at me?

671
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,910
There is no reason, is there?

672
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,430
There is no reason, is there?
Yes, that's right.

673
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:27,270
-That's right! -That's righ.
Why are you doing this to me?

674
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,080
-Let me tell you something.
You start to lie before you even

675
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:34,070
open your mouth. You lie constantly.
I don't lie.

676
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,040
You're jealous.

677
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,080
I'm jealous?
Now I'm jealous.

678
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,470
Do you talk on the phone with him?

679
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,040
Do you date him?
So you laugh 

680
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,400
like two fools.
You look at each other

681
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,760
like two doves.

682
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,110
Like rats.

683
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:58,840
You dance naked in the moonlight.
When somebody looks at me this way,

684
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,160
my dear,

685
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,110
I fuck him "en passant".

686
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:07,600
And then I look like a fool.
Everyone at the coffeehouse stares at you

687
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,760
and then you say that I'm crazy.
When they look at you,

688
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,520
you like it.

689
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:16,680
You like it a lot.
I like it!

690
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,790
-You like it!

691
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,480
You idiot!
Where are you going?

692
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,600
-What? What? You know what?

693
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:26,590
What?

694
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,600
Fuck you!
That's your speciality,

695
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,760
my dear. Come here.

696
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,360
Take me home.
Lift your legs for me a bit.

697
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:36,760
-Take me home.
First we have to 

698
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,320
clear something up.
There is nothing to clear up.

699
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:39,840
Take me home.

700
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,080
You want me to take you to him?
Now he's the one to blame.

701
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,200
-Who's to blame then?

702
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,230
Am I guilty? - It's not your fault.
He's not to blame. I'm not to blame.

703
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,910
Who's to blame? Santa Claus?
He's not guilty? I'm not guilty.

704
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,630
Who is guilty then?
Am I guilty?

705
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,710
Am I guilty?

706
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,630
I am guilty!

707
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,190
You're not guilty.

708
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,840
You're not guilty.

709
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,790
Let's not argue any more.

710
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:31,120
What did you do wrong?

711
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,840
May I help you?

712
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,440
Are you guilty of anything?

713
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:42,390
Have you got a problem?
Are you looking for a problem?

714
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:45,310
-No and you?

715
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:47,950
Then look for the problem.

716
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,080
Don't cock.

717
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:50,440
What do you want?
Everything between us

718
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,840
has ended a long time ago.
I don't want to see you any more.

719
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,830
-You're making a mistake.

720
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:06,760
Natalija, am I intruding?

721
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:12,040
Yes, you're intruding.

722
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:19,000
Who is this monkey?
It's none of your business.

723
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:23,400
-It's none of my business?
Tell him to take a walk.

724
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:28,110
-Kosta is with me.
And he'll stay here.

725
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,240
What do you want?
We have to talk.

726
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:47,750
-We have nothing to talk about.
Kosta?

727
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:58,080
-Don't make a scene.
How are you, Kosta?

728
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,990
-What did Kosta do to you?
Who is to blame?

729
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,800
-Who is to blame?

730
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,080
You're asking who's to blame?
Ask yourself twice,

731
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:13,630
who's to blame.
Who's to blame?

732
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,720
Who's to blame?

733
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:28,480
Natalija, let's go.
Aren't you ashamed,

734
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:33,870
of showing yourself here?
I am ashamed. I'm sorry.

735
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,560
I did a mistake.

736
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,150
I want to apologise.
Apologise?

737
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:44,320
What's it to me?

738
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,550
Look at him.

739
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:57,520
I want to start again.
How many times

740
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,560
did we start again?

741
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:02,640
Natalija...

742
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:09,760
Natalija, this time it's different.
I have learned a lot.

743
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:13,270
I have learned everything.

744
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:19,040
I don't believe a word from you.
Same story every time.

745
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:20,920
Same shit.

746
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,840
I'm fed up with you.
Only I know how

747
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:29,600
I felt when you left.
I don't... I don't want to go though

748
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:33,030
this hell one more time.

749
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:37,400
You're out of my mind, Mane.

750
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:43,030
You will never change.
You could have at least left me a 

751
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,160
message, a letter...

752
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:48,110
Anything.

753
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,240
You know I hate goodbyes.

754
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,830
You hate goodbyes?

755
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:22,150
I'm not young any more.

756
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,910
I don't have time.

757
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,110
Natalija, I'm going.

758
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,440
Kosta.

759
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,920
I'm sorry, Kosta, just a moment.

760
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:56,150
I beg you.

761
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,950
Symphony orchestra.
Your symphony orchestra.

762
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,360
They're playing only for you.

763
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:35,150
For you only.

764
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,600
What are you doing?

765
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,960
Wait!

766
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:12,830
Idiot.

767
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:29,080
He drowned.

768
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:36,270
Because of me.

769
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,360
You're here, Kosta.

770
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:43,840
I'm here.

771
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,430
As long as we're alive and healthy.

772
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,870
Show us how it went.

773
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,910
Not now.

774
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,960
Come on.

775
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:52,760
Show us. Come on.
Good.

776
01:21:53,360 --> 01:22:02,030
How did it go?
Who's to blame?

777
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,990
Let's see who's to blame.

778
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:12,710
I am guilty. I am guilty.
The fish are guilty.

779
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:20,080
The fish are guilty.
The rats are guilty.

780
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,240
The rats are guilty.

781
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:28,190
I am guilty. I am guilty.

782
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:39,040
In the moonlight...
When somebody is looking at you,

783
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,830
you like it.

784
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:54,870
You like it!
Did you speak to him

785
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,950
on the telephone?

786
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,630
Did you run naked in the moonlight?

787
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:04,800
Naked in the moonlight.
Like doves in love.

788
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:10,790
Like rats, like rats.
You look at each other

789
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,760
like rats.

790
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:16,590
Tongue! Tongue!

791
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:38,240
I'm guilty. I'm guilty.
When somebody looks at me this way,

792
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,510
i fuck him "en passant".

793
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:43,600
Bravo, bravo!
En passant.

794
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:48,550
-Bravo!
Who's to blame?

795
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,150
I'm guilty. I'm guilty.

796
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:05,680
He's guite good.
It was a pleasure,

797
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:08,960
to meet you.

798
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:16,240
Good night.
They're so disgusting.

799
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:23,280
-Shut up, shut up.
Make way.

800
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,560
I'm taking her home. Get out of my way.

801
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:35,200
Come here.

802
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,160
Leave her.

803
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:52,560
Leave her alone.

804
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,950
Leave her alone.

805
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,950
Leave her alone.
What does anyone that has the honour

806
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:21,190
to meet Topi, have to do?

807
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:25,280
He has to sing him something.

808
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,510
I can't sing.

809
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:29,920
Maybe you're not aware of the fact that you can.

810
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:33,000
Come on, try.
You better sing.

811
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:40,350
Listen to my advice.
Do you know that one:

812
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:46,110
Toni, toni, clear sun.
Clear sun.

813
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:48,350
-Clear sun.
