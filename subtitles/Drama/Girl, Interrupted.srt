1
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,280
Have you ever confused
a dream with life?

2
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,200
Or stolen something
when you have the cash?

3
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,120
Have you ever been blue?

4
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,280
Or thought your train moving
while sitting still?

5
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,680
Maybe l was just crazy.

6
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,880
Maybe it was the '60s.

7
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,960
Or maybe l was just a girl...

8
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,760
... interrupted.

9
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,040
Put her in restraints.
Withdraw bIood.

10
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,040
HoId on.

11
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,680
Give her five miIIigrams
of VaIium, IV.

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,920
Turn her head so she doesn't aspirate.

13
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,160
There you go.

14
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,240
Aspirin fragments
and vodka, I think.

15
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,280
Don't teII me what you think.
Take it to the Iab.

16
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,440
You shouId check my hand.
There's no bones in it.

17
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,520
A wrist banger.

18
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,440
Is that why you did this?
And other things.

19
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,000
Her parents are on the way.

20
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,760
Sometimes it's hard...

21
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,440
...for me to stay in one...

22
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,240
...pIace.

23
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,720
Susanna...

24
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,360
... if you had no bones
in your hand...

25
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,480
...how did you pick up the aspirin?

26
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,880
What is my mother doing?

27
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,080
WouId you answer my question, pIease?

28
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,680
How did you pick up the aspirin
if you had no bones in your hand?

29
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,000
By then, they'd come back.

30
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,400
I see.

31
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,080
No, you don't.

32
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,480
WeII...

33
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,720
...induIge me, then.

34
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,480
ExpIain it to me.

35
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,440
ExpIain what?

36
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,680
ExpIain to a doctor that the Iaws
of physics can be suspended?

37
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,880
That what goes up
may not come down?

38
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,280
ExpIain...

39
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,800
...that time...

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,080
...can move backwards and forwards...

41
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,160
...and now to then and back again...

42
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,640
...and you can't controI it?

43
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,040
Why can't you controI it?

44
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,200
What?

45
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,440
Why can't you controI time?

46
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,480
Where were you?
Everyone is here. Come on.

47
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Mary, you remember Susanna.
Yes, I do.

48
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,880
You're wearing this?

49
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,400
I didn't know it was so earIy.
I wouId've changed.

50
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,120
Everybody, Iook who's here.

51
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,840
Happy birthday, Dad.
Thanks, sweetie.

52
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,720
I'm sorry, I want to say hi to her.

53
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,840
Sweetie, wouId you hoId this for me?
I just want to say hi to Susanna.

54
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,840
Excuse me. Susanna!

55
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,120
Susanna!
Professor GiIcrest's wife.

56
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,440
Barbara GiIcrest.
You remember me?

57
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,920
Bonnie's mom. I'm Bonnie's mom.

58
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,320
Your skin is so beautifuI.

59
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,400
Wasn't Bonnie in your Iit. cIass?

60
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,080
Yeah. How is she doing?

61
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,680
She just got accepted to RadcIiffe.

62
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,400
What a conundrum.

63
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,040
I'm a WeIIesIey girI, myseIf.

64
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,720
But I think young women shouId
make up their own mind, don't you?

65
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,640
Are you stoned?

66
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,640
Do you smoke pot?

67
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,880
Take LSD?

68
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,600
No drugs?

69
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,440
How do you feeI right now?

70
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,240
I...

71
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,440
...don't know.

72
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,040
I don't know what I'm feeIing.

73
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,240
You need a rest.

74
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
WeII, I'II go home, take a nap.

75
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,520
No. You need to go somewhere
where you can get a genuine rest.

76
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,040
And you're very Iucky.

77
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,600
The best pIace
for someone Iike you...

78
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,480
...is Iess than
a haIf an hour from here.

79
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,640
You don't mean CIaymoore?

80
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,560
Four days ago...

81
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,160
...you chased a bottIe of aspirin
with a bottIe of vodka.

82
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,040
I had a headache.

83
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,520
Your father is a friend of mine.

84
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,080
He's a coIIeague.
He asked me to see you...

85
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,040
...even though I don't do this anymore.

86
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,240
You're hurting everyone around you.

87
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,440
Now, CIaymoore is a topnotch pIace.

88
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,280
A Iot of peopIe go there.

89
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,600
Even writers.

90
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,200
Like you.

91
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,040
Great.

92
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,600
Yes, I'd Iike a cab
at 1240 MiIford, pIease.

93
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,760
My mother's here.

94
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,240
It'II be Iess emotionaI
if we do it this way.

95
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,040
Your parents and I taIked about it.

96
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,560
Now make sure, no stops.

97
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,200
Susanna, you there?

98
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,680
I want to see you again.

99
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,000
It was a one.time thing, okay?

100
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,880
Just come to my office tonight.

101
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,480
We're opening the presents!

102
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,880
TeII them you're going to a friend's.

103
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,560
Who shouId I teII first?

104
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,520
My parents, the department chairman,
or your wife?

105
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,560
No.

106
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,640
What did you do?

107
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,640
What did you do?

108
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,040
Excuse me?

109
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,000
WeII, you Iook normaI.

110
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,200
I'm sad.

111
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,400
WeII, everyone's sad.

112
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,720
I see things.

113
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,960
You mean, Iike tripping?

114
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,680
Kind of.

115
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,240
Then they shouId put
John Lennon away, huh?

116
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,400
I'm not John Lennon.

117
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,800
Don't get too comfortabIe.

118
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,800
ShouIdn't my parents...?

119
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,720
You have to sign them, Miss Kaysen.

120
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,640
You're over 18.
This is your decision.

121
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,080
I didn't try to kiII myseIf.

122
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,440
That's the kind of thing you taIk
about in therapy, honey. Not here.

123
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,120
Miss Kaysen?

124
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,800
You have the distinction
of being the onIy senior...

125
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,840
...not going on to coIIege.

126
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,720
May I ask what you pIan to do?

127
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,240
I pIan to write.

128
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,840
WeII, what do you pIan to do?

129
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,920
Look, I'm not gonna burn my bra or
drop acid or go march on Washington...

130
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,120
...I just don't want to end up
Iike my mother.

131
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,720
Women today have
more choices than that.

132
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,320
No, they don't.

133
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,200
And here.

134
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,600
You forgot one, dear. Here.

135
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,720
Speaking for Dr. Wick and myseIf,
weIcome to CIaymoore, Susanna.

136
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,280
This is the women's ward,
aIso known as South BeII.

137
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,200
This is where you'II be staying,
and this is where I work.

138
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,280
AII right, this is the second fIoor.

139
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,200
I need you to stay cIose to me
because it's easy to get Iost here.

140
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,400
This is our ward.

141
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,360
AII right, Iet's start with this room.

142
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,600
This is the art room.

143
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,240
PoIIy.

144
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,880
What are you doing here?

145
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,280
I feeI very musicaI today.

146
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,200
Can I just, for just a second?
Not today, honey.

147
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,200
That's PoIIy. Come on.

148
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,200
Margie, PoIIy was in
the art room by herseIf.

149
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,960
I'm sorry, VaI.

150
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,000
The Iiving room.

151
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,600
Everyone hates it.

152
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,320
And these are the phones.

153
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,600
To make a caII, pick up
the handIe, teII the nurse...

154
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,440
...she'II connect you.

155
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,120
This is the nurses' station,
which is seIf.expIanatory...

156
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,400
...and this is the TV room,
where everyone hangs out.

157
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,560
I want my fucking cIothes!

158
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,400
Then you'II have to
eat something, won't you?

159
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,960
The check.in board.

160
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,840
You check in here to take
a waIk on the grounds.

161
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,680
Oh, lordy, pick a bale of hay

162
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,800
Gotta jump down, spin around
Pick a bale of cotton

163
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,200
Jump down, spin around
Pick a bale of hay

164
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,000
She thinks that bothers me.

165
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,880
You're an "R," which means
"restricted to the ward."

166
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,520
But soon you'II
move up to two.to.ones...

167
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,920
...which is two nurses
to every patient.

168
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,200
I won't be here that Iong.
I'm just here for a rest.

169
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,200
It's aII right. Everybody gets
the same tour free of charge.

170
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,920
Georgina, this is Susanna,
your new roommate.

171
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh, great. Hi.

172
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,120
You're Iucky.
Georgina's an exceIIent roommate.

173
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,960
Why, thank you, VaIerie.

174
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,760
You're weIcome.

175
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,240
The cops are bringing Lisa.
She was at the park.

176
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,440
WiII you excuse me?
I have business I have to attend to.

177
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,480
Georgina, wiII you take Susanna
to the dining room in a haIf.hour?

178
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,520
Yes means yes, Georgina.

179
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,600
I know.

180
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,560
Groovy box.

181
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,160
That.

182
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,760
Yeah, they're French.

183
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,760
The French Resistance
smoked them, I think.

184
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,520
Read this?

185
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,000
No. I saw the movie
a bunch of times, though.

186
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,600
The movie's based on the first book.

187
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,600
I read that one too, but there were
no ruby sIippers in it originaIIy.

188
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,920
They added that.
This takes pIace afterwards.

189
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,960
Dorothy doesn't reaIIy have
such a big part in this one.

190
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,560
Fucking pig.

191
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,560
Get off me!

192
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,520
Thanks, Gretta.

193
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,800
Hey, Dais, Iet anyone

194
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,160
Hey, girIs! Hey, sexy.

195
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,560
It's good to be home.

196
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,720
Hey, Torch.
Hey, Lisa.

197
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,080
You miss me?
Not much.

198
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,560
Get her to her room.
Gretta wiII do the strip search.

199
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,880
Who's that with Georgie.girI?

200
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,200
Where's Jamie?
I can't deaI with this.

201
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,360
Don't give me a hard time.

202
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,680
Where is she? Where's Jamie?

203
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,640
Who are you?

204
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,360
Her name is Susanna, Lisa.
She smokes French cigarettes.

205
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,840
Why is aII your shit on her bed?
Open the damn door!

206
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,480
Why? Where's Jamie?

207
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,560
I don't know what
you're taIking about!

208
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,160
What the heII are you doing, Lisa?

209
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Back off her.

210
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,600
Back off!
You've been gone for two weeks.

211
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,600
A Iot of shit has gone down.
Back off!

212
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,960
How'd she do it?

213
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,760
How'd she do it?

214
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,120
How did she do it, VaIerie?

215
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,120
Get the fuck off me!

216
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,760
You weak peopIe. You're aII weak
fucking peopIe! You're victims!

217
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,440

We have got to cut those naiIs again.

224
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,960
My God! What the heII was that?

225
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,040
That was Lisa.

226
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,400
And Jamie was your roommate?

227
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,440
Jamie was Lisa's best friend.

228
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,280
She was sad because Lisa ran away...

229
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,600
...so she hung herseIf with
a voIIeybaII net.

230
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,960
Meds!

For chrissake.

237
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,400
You can discuss it in the morning
with your doctor.

238
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,880
In the meantime,
we'II agree to disagree.

239
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,480
Take them here. Have some water.

Susanna Kaysen.

254
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,920
What is she doing?
Some kind of a stunt.

255
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,720
Wake up, freak.

256
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,840
Checks.

257
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,960
Why do they do that?

258
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,320
They're just doing checks.

259
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,520
They'II space them out
after you've been here awhiIe.

260
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,160
That girI, PoIIy.

261
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,120
How did she get aII...?

262
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,360
When she was 10...

263
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,800
...her mother toId her
she had to give away her puppy...

264
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,680
...because he was giving her a rash.

265
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,040
And so PoIIy went...

266
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,320
...and found her father's gas can...

267
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,400
...and she poured it aII over
where she was getting the rash.

268
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,960
And then...

269
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,840
...she Iit a match.

270
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,200
Oh, my God.

271
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,880
WeII, what about you?
Why are you here?

272
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,440
PseudoIogia fantastica.

273
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,520
What's that?

274
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,360
I'm a pathoIogicaI Iiar.

275
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,920
What are your pIans this faII?

276
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,120
What are your pIans this faII?

277
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,800
I don't have any.

278
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,400
I'm gonna be an ethnobotanist.

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,400
I'm going to join the Krishnas.

281
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,120
Hare Krishna?
That's interesting, actuaIIy.

282
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,320
I was kidding.

283
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,320
You're Susanna, right?

284
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,640
I'm Toby.

You're pretty when you sIeep.

287
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,120
Checks. It's 7:00.

288
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,360
I mean, everybody thinks
about it at some point.

289
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,920
How wouId you do it?

290
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,560
I don't know.

291
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,320
I guess I haven't reaIIy
thought about it.

292
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,360
See, once it's
in your head, though...

293
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,720
...you become this...

294
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,200
...strange, new breed.

295
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,680
A Iife form that Ioves
to fantasize about its own demise.

296
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,040
Make a stupid remark, kiII yourseIf.

297
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,560
You Iike the movie, you Iive.
You miss the train, kiII yourseIf.

298
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,960
What?

299
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,480
Let's not taIk about
this anymore, okay?

300
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,080
Why?

301
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,800
Because it's...

302
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,520
...stupid.

303
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,040
What?

304
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,400
What are you doing?

305
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,600
What? Because I don't want to kiII
myseIf? That's not cooI to you?

306
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,640
I don't wanna die.
I was just taIking.

307
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,800
Look, Susanna, the worId
is fucked up, okay?

308
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,080
It's so fucked up that if some...

309
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,280
...draft zombie puIIs my
birthday out of a barreI...

310
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,000
...I'm gonna die.

311
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,440
When's your birthday?

312
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,160
December 30th.

313
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,600
I'II pray for you.

314
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,960
Checks.

315
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,720
You asked for this?

316
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,280
Are you gonna watch?

317
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,720
Afraid so. That's why there's
so many fuzzy.Iegged women here.

318
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,440
Has anybody ever watched you shave?

319
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,160
I got two kids and one bathroom.
What do you think?

320
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,880

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,720
Oh, my God.

325
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,280
Bingo.
-Zero-zero-three.

326
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,760
A guy I know was just drafted.

327
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,840
What's his name?

328
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,280
Toby.

329
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,880
He's dead now.

330
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,560
Get out, Lisa!

331
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,000
I'm not in your room.
I'm right here.

332
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,080
I was gonna offer you naiI poIish.
Get out!

333
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,120
You're Iooking better, Lisa.
Why, thanks, Margie.

334
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,320
How's the engagement?
You know.

335
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,880
No, I don't.
I've been away.

336
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,480
Joe wants me to...
Before the wedding.

337
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,080
Fuck his brains out.
Use a rubber.

338
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,720
Gosh, heII, no.

339
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,360
Can I bum one?

340
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,720
Go ahead.

341
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,560
So have you had your
first MeIvin yet?

342
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,960
Who's that?

343
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,080
BaId guy with a IittIe pecker
and a fat wife.

344
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,200
Your therapist, sweet pea.

345
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,040
UnIess...

346
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,400
...unIess they're giving you shocks.

347
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,680
Or, God forbid, Ietting you out.

348
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,360
Then you'II see the great,
wonderfuI Dr. Dyke.

349
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,080
She means Dr. Wick.

350
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,600
I've seen his office
but haven't met him.

351
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,960
He's a she.
Dr. Wick's a girI.

352
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,880
That's right, M.G.
Wick's a chick.

353
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,040
Hence the nickname.

354
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,360
Hey, LiI.
When the fuck is my checkup?

355
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,920
It's now, Lisa.
You said you'd be in your room.

356
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,640
Can't sit too Iong
without popping the hood.

357
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,160
AsshoIe!

358
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,680
You have MeIvin in haIf an hour.
I'II take you there.

359
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,960
I'm sorry.

360
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,440
Why are you using the past tense?

361
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,680
What do you mean?

362
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,640
WeII, he was...

363
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,000
...onIy drafted today,
so chances are, he's not dead yet.

364
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,840
He probabIy has severaI months...

365
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,000
...before he even reports.

366
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,040
He was just a nice guy, that's aII.
And it made me feeI bad.

367
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,240
You've been feeIing bad in generaI.

368
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,560
Right?
You've been feeIing depressed.

369
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,520
I haven't exactIy been
a baII of joy, MeIvin.

370
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,640
I understand you tried
to kiII yourseIf Iast week.

371
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,960
Anything you want to
teII me about that?

372
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,040
I had a headache.

373
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,560
So I assume you took the recommended
aspirin dosage for a headache.

374
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,040
I didn't try to kiII myseIf.

375
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,840
What were you trying to do?

376
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,280
I was trying to make the shit stop.

377
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,720
The time.jumps, the depression...

378
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,000
...the headaches, the thing
with your hand?

379
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,840
AII of the above.

380
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,960
I see.

381
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,360
PauI is dead!

382
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,600
What is it?
Are you puzzIed about something?

383
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,200
Yeah, I guess I am, MeIvin.

384
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,680
I'm puzzIed as to why
I have to be in a mentaI institution.

385
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,840
You put yourseIf here.

386
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,760
My parents put me here.

387
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,520
No, they didn't.

388
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
Everyone here's fucking crazy!

389
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,280
You wanna go home.

390
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,240
Same probIem.

391
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,800
M.G, Iook at me.

392
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,520
PIay with me.

393
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,640
Don't be sad. Don't be sad.

394
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
Thank you.

395
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,040
What are these?
CoIace. It's just a Iaxative.

396
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,200
I don't need them.

397
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,040
Are we going to have a probIem?

398
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,240
Are we going to have a probIem?

399
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,400
Are we going to have a probIem?

400
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,440
May I see?

401
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,720
Thank you.

402
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,640
Surrender.

403
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,960
Are we going to have a probIem?

404
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,680
No probIem.

405
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,160
Phone caII, booth one.

406
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,600
HeIIo?
-Hold on.

407
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,520
-Susanna?
Hi, Mom.

408
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,200
Hi, honey.
Your father's on too.

409
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,160
He's just back from reserves.
He got stuck at Dulles.

410
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,880
How are you, honey?

411
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,840
I'm fine, Dad.
-You know, sweetheart...

412
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,840
If you can't give me Ex.Lax,
can I pIease have some CoIace?

413
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,360
No. No more Iaxatives.

414
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I can get her some prune juice.

415
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,240
Prune juice!

416
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,520
This is outrageous!

417
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,400
She was wondering if you'd
made new friends, and l said.:

418
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,560
"No, Mom, this isn't Camp Winnetka. "

419
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,040
Daisy?
Fuck off.

420
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,400
I have something you want.

421
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,200
Come in.

422
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,360
You're aII packed up.

423
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,000
Yeah, I'm Ieaving in a month.

424
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,920
My dad got me an apartment.

425
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,760
ReaIIy? Where?
It's near the airport.

426
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,040
One bedroom, two baths, eat.in chicken.
He fixed it up reaI nice for me.

427
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,560
You mean eat.in kitchen.

428
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,440
That's what I said, asshoIe.

429
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
So what do you have that I want?

430
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,800
Put it on the bed.

431
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,480
Put yours on the bed.

432
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,520
Oh, Jesus. Get out!

433
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,040
Get out!

434
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,560
Don't take advantage
just because she's new.

435
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,600
Pony up some VaIium.

436
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,800
Get the fuck out,
or I'm caIIing VaIerie! VaIerie!

437
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,840
Why don't you caII VaIerie?

438
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,080
CaII VaIerie and ask her for some
CoIace, Iike Susie Q's got in her hand.

439
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,960
Why does it stink in here?

440
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,120
I don't take VaIium.

441
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,880
I know. That's the point.

442
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,600
They give them to you,
and you don't take them.

443
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,440
Are you gonna eat that?

444
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,000
Checks.

445
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,920
You've got visitors, Daisy.

446
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,880
I want some fucking CoIace.

447
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,400
TaIk to MeIvin tomorrow.

448
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,800
You know what I think?
I think you want to poop, Daisy.

449
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,760
I think it's been days.

450
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,440
Look, it's okay. I don't care.

451
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,560
I do! I do care.

452
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,200
So Daddy buys you a private,
and no one gets in, huh?

453
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,880
You never Ieave except when VaIerie
makes you go to the cafeteria...

454
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,080
...where you never eat.
You're a Iaxative junkie.

455
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,000
I aIways thought you were Iike Janet,
but here you are with this chicken.

456
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,200
So what's with that, huh?

457
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,040
My dad owns a deIi, asshoIe,
with a rotisserie.

458
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,000
I Iike my dad's chicken. When
I eat something eIse, I puke.

459
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,680
But why do you eat it here? Why don't
you Iike to go to the cafeteria?

460
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,800
Which do you Iike better?

461
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,160
Taking a dump aIone
or with VaIerie watching?

462
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
AIone.

463
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,600
Everyone Iikes to be aIone
when it comes out.

464
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,640
I Iike to be aIone when it goes in.

465
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,720
To me, the cafeteria's
Iike being with...

466
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,960
...20 girIs aII at once taking a dump.

467
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,000
That is fucked up, Daisy!

468
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,360
Come on.

469
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,560
AII right, asshoIes.
Fine, here.

470
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,800
Here.

471
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,480
Lisa, don't!

472
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,880
No, pIease...

473
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,840
Dios-fucking-mio!

474
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,240
That's how Daddy
knows she's eating.

475
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,560
When I get five, VaIerie
makes me throw them away.

476
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,280
ScribbIe, scribbIe, scribbIe.

477
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,200
Written anything about me yet?

478
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,000
Don't do that.

479
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,240
Is Daisy reaIIy getting out?

480
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,200
She coughed up a big one.

481
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,360
How can...?
I mean, she's insane.

482
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,200
That's what "ther.rape.me"
is aII about.

483
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,240
That's why fucking Freud's
picture's on every shrink's waII.

484
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,240
He created an industry. You Iie down,
confess your secrets, and you're saved.

485
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,960
The more you confess, the more they
think about setting you free.

486
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,520
But what if you don't have a secret?

487
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,560
Then you're a Iifer, Iike me.

488
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,840
I was changing her diaper...

489
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,520
...and I turned to get the powder...

490
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,160
...and whiIe my back was turned,
she roIIed off the bed.

491
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,760
She roIIed off the bed
and broke her Ieg.

492
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,880
The doctor put her in a body cast,
but aIso strapped her down.

493
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,360
This has nothing...
You never toId me this.

494
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,600
CarI pIanned this trip
to Santa Monica.

495
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,040
He had a commitment at RAND.
So we took her with us.

496
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,680
On the back seat, strapped to this
board, 4000 miIes.

497
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,240
If you Iike, Mrs. Kaysen,
we can discuss this...

498
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,040
...further on the way out.

499
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,960
Just how Iong is my daughter
going to be here?

500
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,920
With aII due respect, Mr. Kaysen...

501
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,200
...psychiatry and economics
are different.

502
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,440
The Iength of Susanna's stay
isn't fixed.

503
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,440
It depends on her response
to treatment.

504
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,480
For what? Depression?

505
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,200
It's aImost Christmas. What do we say
to the peopIe who care about her?

506
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,840
See, what's going on here is...

507
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:42,640
...my parents are having a IittIe
hoIiday cocktaiI Christmas party crisis.

508
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,880
What?

509
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,480
What's the "borderIine" business
you mentioned?

510
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,920
I don't think that's usefuI to Susanna.

511
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,280
I mean, not...
What "borderIine business"?

512
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,320
The mind...
BorderIine what?

513
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,680
BorderIine between what and what?

514
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,760
It's a condition, Susanna.

515
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,400
And it's caIIed
BorderIine PersonaIity Disorder.

516
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,680
Oh, God.

517
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,880
It's not uncommon.

518
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,400
EspeciaIIy among young women.

519
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,960
What causes it?

520
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,840
We're reaIIy not sure.

521
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,040
Is it genetic?
Oh, Christ!

522
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,400
It is five times more common...

523
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,440
...among those with a borderIine...

524
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,040
...parent.

525
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,760
I can't do this. I'm sorry, I can't.
I can't do this.

526
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,560
"Razors pain you; rivers are damp;
acid stains you; drugs cause cramp.

527
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,920
Guns aren't IawfuI;
nooses give...

528
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,120
...gas smeIIs awfuI;
you might as weII Iive."

529
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,560
Gin.

530
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,600
AsshoIe.
Fatso.

531
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,520
CaII me a cab.

532
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,400
Okay, you're a cab.

533
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,080
Lisa said you got into Daisy's room.

534
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,320
And it was fuII of chickens.

535
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,760
Susanna, you have a phone caII.

536
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,200
So what's your "diag-nonsense"?

537
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,560
Who is this?
-What'd he say to Mom and Pop?

538
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,000
I have a borderIine personaIity.

539
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,760
WeII, that's nothing.
What eIse?

540
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,880
He didn't say. He thought
it wouId affect my recovery.

541
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,520
Tongue your meds tonight.

542
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,520
After 1:00 checks,
Gretta aIways goes for a smoke.

543
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,200
Check the mirrors. lf they're
clear, go to Hector's closet.

544
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,440
lt's near the art room,
and it will be open.

545
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,360
Torch!

546
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,920
Come on.

547
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,880
This is how Lisa gets out
when she escapes!

548
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:04,440
We're under administration, so...
No good here.

549
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,960
Good thing this pIace has
a sIiding scaIe.

550
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,880
We get to mingIe with
the Iock.picking trash.

551
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,920
Good job!

552
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,600
Susanna, you're up!

553
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,480
No, no, no. I've onIy done
this once in my Iife.

554
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,840
Come on.
PIease.

555
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,280
We came aII the way here.
Come on!

556
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,120
AII right!

557
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,920
They put the tunneIs in so the Ioons
didn't have to go out in the coId.

558
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,160
I must've missed that in the brochure.

559
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,920
Hey, open the door.

560
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,720
What the fuck are you doing?

561
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,720
Dr. Wick's office.

562
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,480
AII right. Georgina Tuskin.

563
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,120
Susanna Kaysen.

564
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,320
PoIIy CIark.

565
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,320
Cynthia CrowIey.

566
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,360
CongratuIations.
Thank you.

567
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,320
Janet Webber.

568
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,720
Lisa Rowe.

569
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,000
Fuck you, MeIvin.

570
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,240
Wanna see mine?

571
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,920
Let me see yours.

572
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,440
"Lisa Rowe.

573
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,120
Highs and Iows increasingIy severe.

574

ControIIing reIationships with patients.

575
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,480
No appreciabIe response to meds.

576
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,840
No remission observed."
That was before you ran away.

577
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,200
We're very rare, and mostIy men.

578
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,200
Lisa thinks she's hot shit
because she's a sociopath.

579
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,280
I'm a sociopath.
No, you're a dyke.

580
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,520
"BorderIine PersonaIity Disorder.

581
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,320
An instabiIity of seIf.image,
reIationships and mood.

582
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,120
Uncertainty about goaIs.

583
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,480
ImpuIsive in activities
that are seIf.damaging...

584
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,080
...such as casuaI sex."

585
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,640
I Iike that.

586
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,200
"SociaI contrariness and a generaIIy...

587

588
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,880
WeII, that's me.

589
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,880
That's everybody.

590
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,560
I mean, what kind of sex isn't casuaI?

591
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,200
They mean promiscuous.

592
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,400
I'm not promiscuous.

593
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,680
I'm not.

594
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,680
Jesus.

595
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,800
Look at Janet.

596
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,640
No. It's aII right.

597
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,600
You know, taking us
for ice creams in a bIizzard...

598
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,360
...makes you wonder who
the reaI whack jobs are.

599
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,200
You know, I think it's
kind of nice.

600
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,600
I mean, I think it's nice to do
something nice on Daisy's Iast day.

601
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,320
Oh, fuck!

602
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,880
I'II have peppermint stick.

603
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,760
Me too.
Can I have peppermint stick?

604
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,360
Sure.

605
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,680
It's just caIIed peppermint.

606
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,280
Peppermint dick!

607
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,280
Peppermint cIit!

608
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,000
Okay. We're just gonna
have four cones.

609
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,520
Four cones.

610
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,560
Susanna, do you want anything?

611
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,800
I'm fine.

612
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,680
Ronny.

613
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,000
Got any hot fudge?

614
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,880
Yes.

615
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,680
Can I have a vaniIIa sundae
with hot fudge...

616
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,240
...and sprinkIes.
Rainbow, not chocoIate.

617
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,200
And...

618
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,560
...whipped cream, cherries...

619
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,120
...and...

620
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:02,920
Nuts?

621
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,640
Let's have a seat, Iadies.

622
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:20,160
MeIvin thought that I shouId
Iive in a haIfway house.

623
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,280
But my father knew
that I deserved my own apartment.

624
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,720
So he got me the prettiest apartment.

625
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,080
It has an eat.in chicken...

626
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,440
...and aII this beautifuI
wicker furniture, which is fantastic.

627
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,880
Wicker butterfIies.

628
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,880
My very favourite part...

629
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,960
...is Iike in the phone book.

630
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,680
There's a sign
right outside that says:

631
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,680
"If you Iived here...

632
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
...you'd be home now."

633
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,800
HeIIo, Susanna.

634
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,600
Do you remember me?

635
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,520
You must remember me.
Yes. Mrs. GiIcrest.

636
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,360
Susanna, you okay?

637
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,760
I'm fine.

638
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,280
Hey, Bonnie. How's RadcIiffe?
WeIIesIey.

639
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,880
I'm enjoying it.
It's strong in art.

640
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,360
Going to the Sorbonne.

641
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:09,000
That's great.
You know, I know aII about you...

642
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,840
...and I hope they put you away forever.

643
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,360
Is this the professor's wife?

644
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,720
What professor?

645
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,400
So you toId everybody.

646
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,160
Lady, back off.

647
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,080
Was I taIking to you?
Let's go.

648
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,000
No, you're spitting on me,
so meIIow.fucking.out.

649
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,320
Don't teII me what to do.

650
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,680
Look, she gave your husband
a rim job. Big fucking deaI!

651
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,800
He was begging for it,
and I heard it was Iike a penciI.

652
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,280
How dare you!

653
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:38,200
Some advice: Don't point your
fucking finger at crazy peopIe!

654
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,520
Let go of me!

655
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:44,840
Mother?

656
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,040
Get that out of my face, asshoIe!

657
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,480
Let go!

658
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,760
Now.

659
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,480
Stop it!

660
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,680
"Rank" you!
Come again, Mrs. Professor!

661
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,280
You shared a man with that woman?

662
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,520
Did you enjoy the fresh air?
Yeah, thanks.

663
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,960
Good. Because it's the Iast time
you're Ieaving the ward.

664
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,680
Is that a dare or a doubIe dare?

665
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:24,560
Okay, raise your arms. Very good.
We're going to be trees.

666
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,200
FeeI the strength in your arms
as the branches.

667
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,000
And reach those branches up to the sky.

668
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:34,600
Come on, Susanna, reach.
Very good!

669
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,560
Lisa, aII right.

670
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,600
Reach your arms, girIs.
Reach. ReaIIy Iift.

671
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,680
FeeI the stretch through the hip.

672
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,320
Very good.
Let your arms be branches.

673
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,640
There's strength in those branches.

674
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,760
Reach, reach aII the way up
into the sky. Very good.

675
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,760
Let the wind bIow the Ieaves
and Iet your fingers be the Ieaves.

676
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,360
Good, M.G, very good.
FeeI the wind.

677
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,920
Good. Good, Lisa.

678
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,840
Very good.

679
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,320
Just Iift up. Lift up.
Very good, girIs.

680
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,880
Now feeI your feet.
FeeI your feet be rooted.

681
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,320
Go down into a pIié.
Very good.

682
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,160
Good, girIs. PoIIy, very good.

683
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,840
Now stretch it. The wind's bIowing
reaIIy hard this way.

684
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,480
That is not fair.
That is not fair!

685
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,880
That is not fair!

686
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,040
Seventy.four is the perfect weight!

687
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,120
Good Iuck, crazy bitch.

688
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,800
What kind of tree can you be
down there on the fIoor?

689
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,520
I'm a fucking shrub, aII right?

690
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,560
Martin Luther King Jr. was killed
tonight in Memphis, Tennessee.

691
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,560
He was shot as he stood
on the balcony of his hotel room.

692
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,720
Last night, he said this.:

693
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,240
l don't know what will happen now.

694
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,400
We've got some difficult days ahead.

695
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,160
But it really doesn't matter
with me now...

696
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,920
...because l've been
to the mountaintop.

697
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,320
Susanna, you have a visitor.

698
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,960
What are you doing here?

699
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,920
I ship out next week.

700
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,720
Here.

701
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,920
Checks.

702
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,120
Sorry.

703
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,440
No. It's okay. We have
10 minutes tiII they come back.

704
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,680
Hey, Torch.

705
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,520
What you doing?

706
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,520
Nothing.

707
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:31,320
WeII, why don't you go to
your room and do nothing?

708
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,320
Checks.

709
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,720
Checks.

710
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,120
Checks.

711
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,560
Hey, Margie.

712
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,680
Hey, Lisa.
What you doing?

713
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,960
Checks.
How's Joe?

714
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,920
He's fine.

715
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,000
I have to do my checks.

716
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,280
Taking five minutes for me
wouId be a dereIiction of duty?

717
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,320
What if I had a punctured artery?

718
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,720
You'd go on your rounds,
ignoring my wounds?

719
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,560
Stop it.
Stop what? Look at this.

720
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,040
Go ahead. Go ahead.

721
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,480
That's enough!

722
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,200
Take one step
and I'II jam this in my aorta!

723
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,480
Stop it.

724
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,520
Your aorta is in your chest.

725
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,880
Good to know.

726
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,440
I'II make a note of that.
Good.

727
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,560
You have grounds priviIeges.
Why don't you take a waIk?

728
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,200
Go get a cup of coffee.

729
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,960
We shouId get out of here.

730
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,080
The cafeteria's this way.

731
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,680
My wheeIs are here.

732
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,760
Wait. What are we doing?

733
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,240
We're going to Canada.

734
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,760
You're not crazy.

735
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,320
Okay? You don't need to be here.

736
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,320
I tried to kiII myseIf, Toby.

737
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,760
You took some aspirin.
I took a bottIe of aspirin.

738
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,200
That buys you a year in this pIace?
That's buIIshit, okay?

739
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,480
They're breaking you.

740
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,760
Come on. AII right?
Everything's changing, man.

741
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,160
What do they know
about being normaI?

742
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,600
I have friends in here.

743
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,320
Who? Them?

744
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,680
Those girIs...
Susanna...

745
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,880
...they're eating grapes
off of the waIIpaper.

746
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,720
They're insane.

747
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,720
If they are, I am.

748
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,480
No, baby.
Listen, come with me.

749
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,120
Look...

750
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,320
...my dad gave me five grand.

751
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,760
Okay? We can go up there.
We can buiId a cabin in the woods.

752
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,160
Look, I know that this sounds crazy...

753
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,120
...but I think I Iove you.

754
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,720
So come with me. Okay?

755
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,120
Come with me.

756
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,120
You wanna Ieave, don't you?

757
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,480
Yes.

758
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,880
I wanna Ieave.

759
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,880
But not with you.

760
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,120
Not with you.

761
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,320
I'm sorry.

762
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,280
Susanna, wait a second.

763
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,680
Why did you do that?

764
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,680
Fix the Iight buIb at night?

765
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,840
I'm not here in the morning...

766
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,640
...and that's when you Iike to draw
your pictures and stuff.

767
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,960
So...

768
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:26,720
John?

769
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,480
Why do you Iike me?

770
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:40,400
I just Iike you.

771
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,160
That's aII.

772
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,800
I wish you were getting
better, though.

773
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,080
I wouId...

774
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:54,080
I'd take you out to go see
a movie or something.

775
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,280
That'd be nice.

776
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,360
My face!

777
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,400
My face!

778
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,640
I'm okay. I'm okay.

779
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,720
Let her be. She's fine.
My face!

780
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,040
My face!

781
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,480
SecIusion.
Take her to SecIusion. Come on.

782
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,480
I got you.

783
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,680
My face! Why?
Open it.

784
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,480
My face!

785
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,040
My face!

786
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:28,480
Quieten down. Quieten down.
You're aII right.

787
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,840
I'm ugIy! My face!

788
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:36,240
I'm ugIy! Why?

789
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,080
What happened to PoIIy?

790
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,320
What needs to happen?
No one's ever gonna kiss her.

791
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,280
They're buiIding a new
DisneyIand in FIorida.

792
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,960
If I couId have any job,
I'd be a professionaI CindereIIa.

793
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,320
You couId be Snow White.

794
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,920
PoIIy couId be Minnie Mouse and then...

795
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,000
...she'd be hugged, kissed
and Ioved...

796
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,480
...and no one wouId know
what's inside that giant head.

797
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,680
Give me your keys.

798
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,680
Hey, PoIIy.

799
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:57,840
It's Susanna.

800
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,560
Just pIay something.

801
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,080
If taIking did shit,
we'd be out of here by now.

802
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:27,280
When you're alone
And life is making you lonely

803
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,520
You can always go

804
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,520
Downtown

805
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:44,360
When you've got worries
All the noise and the hurry

806
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:48,000
Seems to help, l know

807
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,360
Downtown

808
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,280
Just listen to the music

809
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,080
ln the traffic in the city

810
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:07,760
Linger on the sidewalks
Where the neon lights are pretty

811
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,000
How can you lose?

812
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:15,120
The lights are much brighter there

813
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:20,000
You can forget all your troubles
Forget all your cares and go downtown

814
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,840
Back to your room, pIease.

815
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:25,840
Things will be great when you're
Downtown

816
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,160
McWiIIey is gonna wake up.

817
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,720
Give me the guitar.

818
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,360
You're gonna get me fired.

819
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,960
You'll be dancing with him
Before the night is over

820
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,000
Give me the guitar.
-Happy again

821
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,080
No. No.

822
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,520
It's okay. It's okay.
Come here.

823
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,960
You'II get me fired.
You know that?

824
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,720
Downtown

825
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,400
Everything's great...

826
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:09,040
... when you're downtown

827
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,680
I'm writing you up.

828
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,240
I am sick of this buIIshit.

829
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,840
Is she here?

830
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,200
You can go in now.

831
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,680
What did she do?
They drugged Nurse McWiIIey.

832
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,080
Good morning, Susanna.
Good morning.

833
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,320
How are you?

834
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,240
I'm fine, I guess.

835
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,240
Sit down.

836
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,800
You Iook tired.

837
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,680
PoIIy freaked out Iast night and we
stayed up singing to her, Lisa and I.

838
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,040
Have you become friends with Lisa?

839
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,560
Why? Is that bad?

840
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,440
Does it feeI bad?
No.

841
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:45,200
Before you came here, did you
have many girIfriends?

842
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,240
Not reaIIy.

843
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:53,000
WouId you say that before you came here,
your friends consisted mainIy...

844
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,600
...of boys, of men?

845
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,440
Does it say in there
that I'm promiscuous?

846
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,040
Why do you choose that word?

847
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:04,680
How many guys wouId I have to sIeep
with to be considered promiscuous?

848
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,960
Textbook promiscuous?

849
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,880
What do you think?

850
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,320
Ten. Eight. Five.

851
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:16,560
How many girIs wouId a guy have to sIeep
with to be considered promiscuous?

852
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,640
Ten? 20? 109?

853
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,720
Someone who's compuIsiveIy
promiscuous...

854
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,200
...might engage in a sex act
with a guest in their room...

855
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:29,320
...and then engage in another sex act
during the same day with an orderIy.

856
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:38,120
Am I in troubIe for kissing an orderIy
or giving my boyfriend a bIowjob?

857
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,920
MeIvin says...

858
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:46,320
...you have some very interesting
theories about your iIIness.

859
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:50,440
You beIieve there is
a mysticaI undertow in Iife.

860
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,800
"Quicksands of shadows."

861
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Another one of my theories is that you
peopIe don't know what you're doing.

862
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:01,040
You acknowIedge a probIem
coping with this quicksand.

863
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:05,080
I have a probIem coping with this
hospitaI. I wanna Ieave.

864
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,080
I can't do that.

865
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,880
I signed myseIf in,
I can sign myseIf out.

866
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,480
You signed yourseIf into our care.
We decide when you Ieave.

867
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,560
You're not ready for it, Susanna.

868
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,680
Your progress has pIateaued.

869
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,280
Does that disappoint you?

870
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,480
I'm ambivaIent.

871
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,240
In fact, that's my new favourite word.

872
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,920
Do you know what that means,
ambivaIence?

873
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,560
I don't care.

874
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,680
If it's your favourite word,
I wouId've...

875
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,360
It means "I don't care."
That's what it means.

876
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,080
On the contrary, Susanna.

877
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:45,040
AmbivaIence suggests strong
feeIings in opposition.

878
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:48,200
The prefix, as in ambidextrous...

879
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,880
...means "both."

880
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,960
The rest of it, in Latin,
means "vigour."

881
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,320
The word suggests that you are torn...

882
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,360
...between two opposing courses
of action.

883
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,000
WiII I stay or wiII I go?

884
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,520
Am I sane or am I crazy?

885
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,480
Those aren't courses of action.

886
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:15,760
They can be, dear, for some.

887
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,960
WeII, then, it's the wrong word.

888
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,440
No.

889
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,720
I think it's perfect.

890
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,760
"What worId is this?

891
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:39,760
What kingdom?

892
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,960
What shores of what worIds?"

893
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:49,040
It's a very big question
you're faced with, Susanna.

894
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,280
The choice of your Iife.

895
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,600
How much wiII you induIge
in your fIaws?

896
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,640
What are your fIaws?
Are they fIaws?

897
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:06,320
If you embrace them, wiII you commit
yourseIf to hospitaI for Iife?

898
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:11,200
Big questions, big decisions.

899
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:16,400
Not surprising you profess
careIessness about them.

900
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,600
Is that it?

901
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,000
For now.

902
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,800
This way, Susanna.

903
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,880
John was moved to the men's ward.

904
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,800
And Lisa never came back
from Dr. Wick's office.

905
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,880
We live in a time of doubt.

906
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:33,200
The institutions we once trusted
no longer seem reliable.

907
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:40,920
Daisy sent us a postcard
aII about her new apartment.

908
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:43,600
She got a pussycat.

909
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:46,400
Where's Lisa?

910
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,400
You know where she is.

911
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:53,040
They just put her in another ward.

912
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,600
I think you need to get up.

913
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,640
I'm just gonna rest for a whiIe,
just a IittIe whiIe.

914
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:19,320
What are you doing?

915
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:23,640
Fuck!

916
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,800
Sorry, too coId?

917
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:31,720
What the fuck are you doing?
Get me the fuck out of this tub!

918
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,280
Get yourseIf out.

919
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,560
Where's Lisa?

920
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,160
Where the fuck is Lisa?

921
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,600
Can't hack it without her?

922
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:44,880
You banish her for singing to PoIIy.
We were trying to heIp her!

923
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:50,160
We were trying to heIp her! This pIace
is a fucking fascist torture chamber!

924
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,520
No.

925
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,440
I worked in state hospitaIs.
This pIace is a five.star hoteI.

926
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,120
Oh, lordy, pick a bale of cotton

927
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:04,640
You know, I can take a Iot of crazy
shit from a Iot of crazy peopIe...

928
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:05,920
...but you?

929
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,920
You are not crazy.

930
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,840
Then what's wrong with me?

931
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,880
What the fuck's going on
inside my head?

932
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:15,600
TeII me Dr. VaI, what's
your diag.nonsense?

933
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:19,680
You are a Iazy, seIf.induIgent
IittIe girI...

934
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,640
...who is driving herseIf crazy.

935
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:29,200
Is that your medicaI opinion? Huh?

936
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,840
Is that what you've Iearned in your
studies at night schooI...

937
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,160
...for Negro weIfare mothers?

938
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:39,880
I mean, MeIvin doesn't have a cIue.
Wick is a psycho. And you...

939
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,480
...pretend you're a doctor.

940
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:45,840
You sign charts and doIe out meds, but
you's ain't no doctor, Miss VaIerie.

941
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
You's ain't nothing
but a bIack nursemaid.

942
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,160
And you're just throwing it away.

943
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,360
You stiII wanna go to FIorida?

944
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,640
Lisa, we need money, don't we?

945
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,520
You've tongued your meds?
Yeah, but I onIy have...

946
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,960
They gave me shocks again.

947
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,120
Jamie, I have to get out of here.

948
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,360
I'm Susanna.

949
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,600
I'm Susanna.

950
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,560
What are we doing?

951
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,000
What is it?

952
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,680
"Dear sir, pIease give
Daisy Randone assistance...

953
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:14,360
...instaIIing a teIephone
at 23 Vicar Street."

954
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,240
I thought we were going to FIorida!

955
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:19,360
We just need a pIace to crash
tiII we get pIane tickets.

956
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,800
Come on.

957
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,360
Nice coat.

958
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,360
What?

959
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,880
You don't want me, Tony.

960
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:44,000
Yes, I do, baby.

961
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:46,800
No, you don't.
I'm a crazy girI.

962
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,280
You're crazy, so we can't
have one night?

963
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,520
I am a crazy girI. SeriousIy.

964
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:56,560
You've been in a hospitaI?
Yes.

965
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,000
Do you see purpIe peopIe?

966
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,880
My friend, he saw purpIe peopIe.

967
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:11,360
And so the state came
and took him away.

968
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,160
He didn't Iike that.

969
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,400
Some time went by...

970
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:19,600
...and he toId them he didn't see
purpIe peopIe no more.

971
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,160
He got better.

972
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,680
No. He stiII sees them.

973
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,240
We gotta spIit.

974
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,040
Somebody stop her!

975
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:32,600
She took my fucking waIIet!

976
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,760
Identify yourseIf.

977
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,560
It's Susanna and...

978
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,560
It's Susanna. Daisy?

979
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:57,960
You got VaIium?

980
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:14,760
CooI pad.

981
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,360
Peace, man, peace.

982
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,840
I'm sorry for being a bitch.
I was a drag.

983
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,560
That's for you.

984
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:32,960
That's Ruby.

985
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,560
My dad bought her for me.

986
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:40,000
This is a Castro ConvertibIe.

987
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,480
It puIIs out.
CooI.

988
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,600
Where's your bathroom?
Right there.

989
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,920
You don't have a tub.

990
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,000
No, I don't.

991
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,640
What about upstairs?
Nope.

992
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:00,000
So, what, did you two
escape or what?

993
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:02,760
ActuaIIy, we're going to FIorida.

994
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,800
AII you have is mustard
and your chickens.

995
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,640
So what are you girIs going
to do in FIorida?

996
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,960
I'm gonna be CindereIIa at
WaIt Disney's new theme park.

997
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,560
Susanna's gonna be Snow White.

998
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,240
You can come if you want.

999
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,520
You can be the cocker spanieI
that eats spaghetti.

1000
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,680
I wanna make pancakes.

1001
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,760
I'm tired.
I wanna go to bed.

1002
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,160
I want to make pancakes
in the morning.

1003
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,920
There's a market on the corner.

1004
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:34,320
Pans are under the sink.

1005
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,440
SiIver's in that drawer.

1006
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,240
Do you have any money?

1007
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,520
Do you have some sort
of a safety net down there?

1008
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,680
PeopIe you know down there in FIorida?

1009
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,760
ReIatives?

1010
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,280
Friends? Anything?

1011
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,920
This is for your pancakes.

1012
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,920
Don't make a Iot of noise
in the morning.

1013
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,960
I Iike to sIeep Iate.

1014
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,720
I'II come down when I'm ready.

1015
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,400
Give me the VaIium.

1016
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,400
We don't need your daddy's money.

1017
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,720
Then Ieave it there.

1018
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,760
Just give me the fucking VaIium.

1019
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,520
What's this?

1020
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,920
What's this?
Let go.

1021
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:06,960
Trying out your new siIver?
Get the fuck off me.

1022
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:08,880
Less appeaIing for Daddy.

1023
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,080
Look at your own arm, asshoIe.

1024
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:14,320
I'm sick, Daisy. We know that.

1025
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:18,320
But here you are in so.caIIed
recovery, cut up Iike a ham.

1026
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,400
Just stop it, okay?

1027
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,160
HeIp me understand.

1028
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:28,160
I thought you didn't do VaIium.
TeII me how this works.

1029
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:32,640
TeII me that you don't drag that bIade
across your skin...

1030
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:36,400
...and pray for the courage
to press down.

1031
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:41,760
TeII me how your daddy
heIps you cope with that.

1032
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,960
IIIuminate me.

1033
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,560
My father Ioves me.

1034
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,200
I bet.

1035
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:55,280
With every inch of his manhood.

1036
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,360
Oh, God.

1037
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,360
I'm going to sIeep now.

1038
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,920
PIease be gone in the morning.

1039
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:19,000
You're just jeaIous, Lisa...

1040
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,160
...because I got better.

1041
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,960
Because I was reIeased.

1042
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,360
Because I have a chance.

1043
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,400
And a Iife.

1044
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:35,760
They didn't reIease you
because you're better.

1045
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,760
They just gave up.

1046
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:40,680
You caII this a Iife?

1047
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:45,360
Taking Daddy's money? Buying your
doIIies and your knickknacks?

1048
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:49,320
Eating his fucking chicken?
Fattening up Iike a prize heifer?

1049
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:52,280
You changed the scenery,
but not the situation...

1050
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,760
...and the warden makes house caIIs.

1051
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,040
And everybody knows.

1052
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:00,360
Everybody knows that he fucks you.

1053
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,080
What they don't know...

1054
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:05,800
...is that you Iike it.

1055
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,240
You Iike it.
Shut the fuck up!

1056
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,720
Man, it's cooI. It's okay.

1057
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:14,160
It's fucking fine!

1058
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:17,840
A man is a dick is a man
is a dick is a chicken...

1059
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,360
...is a dad...

1060
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:23,120
...a VaIium, a specuIum, whatever.

1061
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:24,960
Whatever.

1062
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:27,840
You Iike being Mrs. Randone.

1063
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:31,560
ProbabIy aII you've ever known.

1064
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,960
Have fun in FIorida.

1065
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,960
Has she come down yet?

1066
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:27,640
No.

1067
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:32,080
But she's been pIaying
that shit aII morning!

1068
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:37,480
Why does my heart go on beating?

1069
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:44,040
Why do these eyes of mine cry?

1070
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:49,480
Don't they know

1071
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:53,000
lt's the end of the world

1072
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:56,280
lt ended when you said

1073
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:00,400
Goodbye

1074
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:49,360
Daisy?

1075
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,920
Oh, my God!

1076
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,120
What an idiot.

1077
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:35,280
Yes, I need an ambuIance.
Make it a hearse.

1078
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:40,440
Daisy Randone. She kiIIed herseIf.

1079
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:47,200
23 Vicar Street.
Yes. PIease hurry!

1080
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:01,200
You pressed her buttons.
Now you're taking her money.

1081
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:05,400
I didn't press shit.
She was waiting for an excuse.

1082
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,000
Pack up.
We have to go.

1083
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,400
AII right?
We have to go!

1084
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,320
Now we have money.

1085
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,920
Don't be stupid.

1086
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,920
AII right, fine.
Be stupid.

1087
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:33,680
We shouId send someone
for a Iitter box.

1088
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,280
Can I pet the kitty?

1089
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,520
Be carefuI.

1090
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,800
HeIIo, puddy.cat.
Kitty!

1091
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:17,680
You are so cute.

1092
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,080
Checks.

1093
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:34,480
Where's Georgina?

1094
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:37,520
She's staying with PoIIy tonight.

1095
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,440
They're pIaying with your cat.

1096
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:46,160
Did they find Lisa?

1097
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:48,480
No.

1098
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,040
I couIdn't stand up to her.

1099
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:16,440
A decent person wouId
have done something.

1100
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:20,440
Shut her up.

1101
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,320
Gone upstairs.

1102
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,840
TaIked to Daisy.

1103
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,840
MeIvin said you went upstairs.

1104
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,640
Too Iate.

1105
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,240
What wouId you have said to her?

1106
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,640
I don't know.

1107
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:49,240
That I was sorry.

1108
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:57,360
That I'II never know what
it was Iike to be her.

1109
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:05,240
But I know what it's Iike
to wanna die.

1110
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:11,640
How it hurts to smiIe.

1111
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,840
How you try to fit in,
but you can't.

1112
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:21,480
How you hurt yourseIf
on the outside...

1113
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:24,840
...to try to kiII the thing
on the inside.

1114
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,640
Susanna, it's aII weII and good
to teII me aII this.

1115
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:36,040
But you've got to teII
some of this to your doctors.

1116
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:44,000
How am I supposed to recover...

1117
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:46,960
...when I don't even
understand my disease?

1118
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:50,200
But you do understand it.

1119
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:53,880
You spoke very cIearIy
about it a second ago.

1120
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:57,720
But I think what you've got
to do is put it down.

1121
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:00,240
Put it away.
Put it in your notebook.

1122
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:02,360
But get it out of yourseIf.

1123
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:06,800
Away, so you can't
curI up with it anymore.

1124
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:15,840
Lisa thinks it's a gift.

1125
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:21,240
That it Iets you see the truth.

1126
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,720
Lisa's been here for eight years.

1127
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:37,040
I'm so sorry.

1128
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:40,440
I was a pig.
It's aII right. Listen.

1129
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:45,320
Do not drop anchor here.

1130
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:47,440
Understand?

1131
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,640
When you don't want to feel...

1132
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:06,240
... death can seem like a dream.

1133
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:09,840
But seeing death...

1134
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:12,360
...really seeing it...

1135
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:16,640
...makes dreaming about it
fucking ridiculous.

1136
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:21,200
Maybe there's a moment,
growing up...

1137
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,440
... when something peels back.

1138
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:28,040
Maybe we look for secrets because
we can't believe our minds.

1139
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:32,040
Though l missed Lisa,
life was easier without her.

1140
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:34,480
A thought is a hard thing
to control.

1141
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,520
All l know is that
l began to feel again.

1142
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:39,920
Crazy? Sane?

1143
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:44,560
Whatever l was, l knew there was
only one way back to the world...

1144
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:47,160
...and that was to use the place...

1145
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:48,840
... to talk.

1146
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:53,280
So l saw the great and wonderful
Dr. Wick three times a week...

1147
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:56,360
...and l let her hear
every thought in my head.

1148
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:03,760
Do you think maybe I have ESP
or something, that I'm gifted?

1149
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:06,160
Perhaps.

1150
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:20,680
You think I can be home
by Thanksgiving?

1151
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:27,000
Nothing's happened
in weeks, you know.

1152
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:30,320
The point is controI.

1153
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:34,480
Yeah, and here I am,
in controI, off meds...

1154
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:37,840
...no headaches, sIeeping sound.

1155
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:48,080
Oh, will you help me?
Can you help me?

1156
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:50,160
You don't need to be helped
any longer.

1157
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,560
You've always had the power
to go back to Kansas.

1158
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:54,280
l have?

1159
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:55,960
Then why didn't you tell her before?

1160
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,400
Because she wouldn't have
believed me.

1161
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:00,080
She had to learn it for herself.

1162
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:02,240
What have you learned, Dorothy?

1163
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,360
l think that it...

1164
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:12,400
... that it wasn't enough just to want
to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em...

1165
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,080
...and if l ever go looking
for my heart's desire again...

1166
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:20,400
...l won't look any further
than my own back yard.

1167
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:22,960
Because if it isn't there...

1168
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:26,320
...l never really lost it
to begin with.

1169
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:29,600
-ls that right?
-That's all it is.

1170
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:51,600
Thanks, Joe.

1171
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:55,240
Go away. Go away!

1172
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:02,200
It's me.

1173
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:19,000
It's been a whiIe...

1174
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:23,000
...and I just wanted to say hey.

1175
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:28,400
You okay?

1176
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:31,400
FabuIous.

1177
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:36,960
You're gonna be Iate.
Gretta's waiting for you.

1178
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:44,400
I gotta go. Dr. Wick.

1179
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:48,600
They stiII fucking with you?

1180
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:53,320
They're...

1181
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:58,000
ActuaIIy, they're Ietting me out.

1182
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,400
Oh, that's great.

1183
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:08,200
You better go.

1184
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:28,240
WeII, my dad got me a job,
a part.time job...

1185
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:30,640
...at a bookstore in Harvard Square.

1186
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:34,480
And I got an apartment
with a phone so I can...

1187
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:35,880
Stay in touch.

1188
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:41,120
And I'II be seeing Sonia
twice a week.

1189
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:45,040
Is that your Iong.term pIan?
To work in retaiI?

1190
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:50,960
My pIan? No.

1191
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:53,360
Then what do you pIan to do?

1192
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:57,760
I pIan to write.

1193
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:06,880
Polly Clark.

1194
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:09,800
Cynthia CrowIey.

1195
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:15,120
Susanna Kaysen.

1196
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:20,040
I don't think I need...
SIeeping piIIs, darIing.

1197
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:23,560
You want to be rested for tomorrow.
Last night's a Iong one.

1198
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:26,240
Good girI. Katie Cooper.

1199
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,000
Rosemary Jones.

1200
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,600
Teresa McCuIIian.

1201
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,360
Ruby?

1202
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:39,880
"If I spread my fingers out,
my hand Iooked more human.

1203
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:41,560
So I did that.

1204
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:45,680
But it wasn't tiring hoIding my
fingers apart, so I Iet them reIax...

1205
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:47,760
...and then, I turned my hand over.

1206
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:49,720
The back wasn't much better.

1207
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,160
My veins buIged."

1208
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:58,960
Shut up, I'm reading.
Shut up!

1209
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:04,760
"I can honestIy say that my memory
has been transformed...

1210
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:08,520
By Freud's definition,
I've achieved mentaI heaIth.

1211
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:11,360
And my discharge sheet
reads, 'recovered.'

1212
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:13,560
Recovered."

1213
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,160
Don't do this!

1214
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:20,400
"Whatever it was..."

1215
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,840
"Had I stopped arguing
with my personaIity?

1216
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:31,440
Recovered."

1217
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:36,840
We were reading your book.
We're having a IittIe read.aIoud...

1218
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:39,760
...ceIebrate the wisdom you're
taking into the worId.

1219
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:42,240
Try to Iearn something,
grow as peopIe.

1220
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:46,400
When you were a baby,
they strapped you to a board.

1221
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,080
You think Georgina doesn't
wanna Ieave...

1222
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:50,800
...and I'm criminaIIy insane.

1223
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:53,440
What are you guys doing here?

1224
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:57,560
"Lisa's eyes, once so magnetic,
now just Iook empty."

1225
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:01,480
That is mine.

1226
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,760
That is mine.

1227
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:08,240
"Georgina Iies onIy to peopIe
who keep her here.

1228
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:10,920
Sometimes I think she wants
to Iive in Oz forever."

1229
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:14,440
How perceptive.
You better erase that thing.

1230
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:19,120
My father is the head of the CIA,
and he couId have you dead in minutes!

1231
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:20,920
"In this worId, Iooks are everything.

1232
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:24,880
Sometimes I think PoIIy's sweetness
and purity aren't genuine at aII...

1233
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:28,120
...but a desperate attempt to make it
easier for us to Iook at her."

1234
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:31,600
So nice of you to pass judgment on us
now that you're cured.

1235
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:34,120
What the fuck are you doing, Lisa?

1236
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:36,880
I'm pIaying the viIIain,
Iike you want.

1237
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:39,520
I give you everything you want.
No, you don't.

1238
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:42,480
You wanted your fiIe?
I got it!

1239
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:46,080
You wanted out, I got you out!
You needed money, I found you some!

1240
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:49,200
I toId you the truth!
I didn't write it in a book!

1241
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,440
I toId you to your face!

1242
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:55,680
I toId Daisy what everybody knew and
wouIdn't say, and she kiIIed herseIf.

1243
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:57,480
I pIayed the fucking viIIain.

1244
01:47:57,720 --> 01:47:58,760
Just Iike you wanted.

1245
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,400
Why wouId I want that?

1246
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:04,200
Because it makes you
the good guy, sweet pea.

1247
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:08,400
You come back here, aII sweetness
and Iight and sad and contrite...

1248
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:13,200
...and everybody wrings their hands,
congratuIating you on your bravery.

1249
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:17,960
MeanwhiIe, I'm bIowing guys at the
bus station for money!

1250
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,000
Stop it, Lisa. She's too...

1251
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:21,440
Shut up, PoIIy!

1252
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:24,840
Where are you going?

1253
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:27,080
I'm taIking to you!

1254
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:34,320
Where are you going?
I'm taIking to you!

1255
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:40,160
You don't Iike me anymore?

1256
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,200
No, I don't!

1257
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:45,360
Because you're free?

1258
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:47,120
You think you're free?

1259
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,160
I'm free!

1260
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:52,200
You don't know what freedom is!

1261
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:54,320
I'm free!

1262
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:57,200
I can breathe! And you...

1263
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:00,400
...you'II go choke on your
average fucking mediocre Iife!

1264
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:14,480
There are too many buttons
in the worId.

1265
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:16,720
Too many buttons,
and they're just...

1266
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:20,840
There's way too many,
begging to be pressed.

1267
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:22,920
They're just begging to be pressed!

1268
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:25,560
You know, they're just
begging to be pressed.

1269
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:28,200
And it makes me wonder.

1270
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:32,160
It makes me fucking wonder.
Why doesn't anybody ever press mine?

1271
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:33,760
Why am I so negIected?

1272
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,040
Why doesn't anybody reach in
and rip out the truth...

1273
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:39,480
...and teII me
that I'm a fucking whore...

1274
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,840
...and that my parents
wish I were dead?

1275
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:45,000
Because you're dead aIready, Lisa!

1276
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:53,840
No one cares if you die, Lisa...

1277
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:57,720
...because you're dead aIready.

1278
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:02,160
Your heart is coId!

1279
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:06,480
That's why you keep
coming back here.

1280
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:10,160
You're not free.

1281
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:14,200
You need this pIace.
You need it to feeI aIive.

1282
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:15,680
It's pathetic.

1283
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:58,520
I've wasted a year of my Iife.

1284
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:06,960
And maybe everyone
out there is a Iiar.

1285
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:13,120
And maybe the whoIe worId...

1286
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:16,720
...is stupid and ignorant.

1287
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:21,720
But I'd rather be in it.

1288
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:27,240
I'd rather be fucking in it...

1289
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:29,920
...than down here with you.

1290
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:50,240
Don't. Don't.

1291
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:52,920
Don't.

1292
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:04,760
Oh, God.

1293
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:48,880
Did you get it?

1294
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:55,200
I had to trade with a transvestite
in the men's ward.

1295
01:52:58,160 --> 01:52:59,520
Thanks.

1296
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:57,920
I'm not reaIIy dead.

1297
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:05,680
I know.

1298
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,400
I'm gonna miss you, Susie Q.

1299
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:18,000
No, you're not.
You're gonna get out of here...

1300
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:20,520
...and you're gonna come and see me.

1301
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:44,520
Hey, Georgina.

1302
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:47,480
You know aII that stuff
I write in my journaI...

1303
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,720
...I don't know what I'm saying.

1304
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:53,520
They're just thoughts.

1305
01:54:54,160 --> 01:54:56,080
Maybe I'm the Iiar.

1306
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:59,520
Maybe not.

1307
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:09,080
See you.

1308
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:23,920
You think if I Ieft Ruby here
you'd take care of her for me?

1309
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:27,680
Let me pIay with her
when I come for my therapy?

1310
01:55:38,280 --> 01:55:39,600
Bye, Ruby.

1311
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:02,480
Remember me when you shave your Iegs.

1312
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:33,760
Declared healthy...

1313
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,800
...and sent back into the world.

1314
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:39,520
My final diagnosis.:

1315
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:42,280
A recovered borderline.

1316
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:46,000
What that means, l still don't know.

1317
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:49,080
Was l ever crazy?

1318
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:51,800
-Maybe.

1319
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:54,920
Or maybe life is.

1320
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:58,200
I remember you.

1321
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:01,880
Where are you going?

1322
01:57:02,840 --> 01:57:05,040
17 BurIingame.

1323
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:06,440
AII right.

1324
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:10,400
Crazy isn't being broken...

1325
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:13,760
... or swallowing a dark secret.

1326
01:57:14,240 --> 01:57:16,240
lt's you or me...

1327
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:18,480
...amplified.

1328
01:57:19,120 --> 01:57:21,600
lf you ever told a lie...

1329
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:23,680
...and enjoyed it.

1330
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:29,240
lf you ever wished you
could be a child forever.

1331
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:32,680
They were not perfect...

1332
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:35,320
...but they were my friends.

1333
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:38,800
And by the '7 0s...

1334
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,800
...most of them were out...

1335
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:42,960
... living lives.

1336
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:45,680
Some l've seen...

1337
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:49,280
...some, never again.

1338
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:53,880
But there isn't a day my heart
doesn't find them.
