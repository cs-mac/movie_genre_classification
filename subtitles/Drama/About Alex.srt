Ben.

10
00:02:24,752 --> 00:02:25,751
Your page's set?

11
00:02:25,752 --> 00:02:27,287
Mm, yep.

12
00:02:27,288 --> 00:02:29,958
Almost.

13
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:32,598
Jesus, Alex.

14
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:37,598
Hello?

15
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:42,836
Yes, this is him,
but I'm at work.

16
00:02:53,747 --> 00:02:56,250
Used to have a freshman
roommate named Ben, but

17
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:59,590
that asswad hasn't
called me in ages.

18
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,525
What?

19
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:06,592
And no one was there?

20
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:07,661
He was...

21
00:03:07,662 --> 00:03:09,996
Alone?

22
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:11,365
Yeah, of course he was alone.

23
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:13,333
That was stupid.

24
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:16,303
Yeah, I can probably
get up in a couple hours. I just

25
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:19,846
need a little bit of time
to get out of here.

26
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,846
Well, he's gonna be okay.

27
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:28,249
That's the most important thing.

28
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:30,350
Okay.

29
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:30,618
I gotta take this.

30
00:03:30,818 --> 00:03:32,386
Hang on a sec.

31
00:03:32,387 --> 00:03:34,388
Babe?

32
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:35,489
Yeah, I'm fine.

33
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,490

Did the hospital say when
they'd be able to release

37
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:01,847
him?

38
00:04:01,848 --> 00:04:03,583
Said it might be tonight.

39
00:04:03,584 --> 00:04:04,717
Might be in the morning.

40
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:05,452
Do we call them?

41
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,387
Because I feel like if we...

42
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:08,755
I called them already.

43
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:10,723
There's nothing else we can do.

44
00:04:10,724 --> 00:04:11,892
Yeah.

45
00:04:11,893 --> 00:04:14,033
Just keep straight.

46
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:19,600
Babe?

47
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,636
Mm?

48
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,541
I got the fellowship.

49
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:28,744
Wow.

50
00:04:29,744 --> 00:04:30,576
Wow.

51
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:32,345
Yeah, I know.

52
00:04:32,346 --> 00:04:34,080
When were you going to tell me?

53
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:34,761
What do you mean?

54
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,049
I'm telling you now.

55
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,085
Yeah, h-how long
have you known?

56
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:40,087
I found out yesterday.

57
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:42,789
Yeah, I mean, it's, it's
great for you, right?

58
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,458
It's a great opportunity.

59
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:45,459
- Yeah
- Yeah.

60
00:04:46,026 --> 00:04:47,561
It is, but...

61
00:04:47,562 --> 00:04:51,063
And then about us
moving out there.

62
00:04:51,064 --> 00:04:53,800
I think we've had this
conversation like fifty times.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,471
I can't just quit my
job and move to LA.

64
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:54,160
Sarah's train should
be getting in.

65
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:55,828
Okay.

66
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:57,701
I'm gonna stay here.

67
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:02,535
Josh!

68
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:03,169
Hey.

69
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,873
Hey, Sarah, uh, hi.

70
00:06:06,874 --> 00:06:10,643
Hi.

71
00:06:10,644 --> 00:06:11,484
It's good to see you.

72
00:06:11,485 --> 00:06:14,047
Oh, yeah, it's good
to see you too.

73
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:16,450
Have you talked to Alex?

74
00:06:16,451 --> 00:06:19,152
No, but I can't wait to
ask that fucker what the

75
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:21,520
hell he was thinking.

76
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:23,890
Um, you're not actually
going to say that to him,

77
00:06:23,891 --> 00:06:24,924
- are you?
- Why not?

78
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:26,805
Because he's fragile and
that's not appropriate.

79
00:06:26,806 --> 00:06:27,528
How do you know?

80
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:29,665
When was the last time
you talked to him?

81
00:06:30,665 --> 00:06:31,931
That's what I thought.

82
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:33,132
What do you want to do, Sarah?

83
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:34,900
You wanna just tiptoe
around the whole thing?

84
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:37,169
Pretend like nothing happened?

85
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,806
No, no, I think we should...

86
00:06:39,807 --> 00:06:41,775
I think we should make
him feel safe and...

87
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,809
Oh, okay.

88
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,876
Loved, and...

89
00:06:43,877 --> 00:06:45,078
Yeah, and I think he's
going to think that that's

90
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,814
bullshit, and I think he's
going to see right through it.

91
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:48,547
<i>Sarah!</i>

92
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:49,249
What?

93
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,083
<i>Josh!</i>

94
00:06:50,084 --> 00:06:50,617
Hey.

95
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:52,055
Hi!

96
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:55,155
And you!

97
00:06:55,156 --> 00:06:57,590
We didn't even know
whether to expect you or not.

98
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:58,891
No, well...

99
00:06:58,892 --> 00:07:00,126
Where's Isaac?

100
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:01,828
Is he up here yet with
the new lady friend?

101
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:02,929
Is that happening?

102
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:03,897
With the who?

103
00:07:03,898 --> 00:07:04,998
Isaac's bringing someone?

104
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:05,799
Yeah.

105
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,600
His girlfriend.

106
00:07:06,601 --> 00:07:07,967
I didn't know he
was seeing anyone.

107
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:08,734
It's recent.

108
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:09,768
It's recent.

109
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:10,703
She's 22.

110
00:07:10,704 --> 00:07:11,638
No she's not.

111
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,571
Mhmm.

112
00:07:12,572 --> 00:07:13,907
Is she?

113
00:07:13,908 --> 00:07:14,474
What's wrong?

114
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,395
It's not like she's 11.

115
00:07:15,396 --> 00:07:16,342
Calm down.

116
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:18,383
Okay, first of all, you're
disgusting, and second of

117
00:07:18,384 --> 00:07:21,248
all, um, why does Isaac
think it's appropriate to

118
00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:22,249
bring a date to...

119
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,284
How is it inappropriate?

120
00:07:23,285 --> 00:07:24,518
I was this close to
bringing, I was this close

121
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,759
to bringing a date, and she
canceled at the last minute.

122
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
She had a thing.

123
00:07:32,158 --> 00:07:32,759
Hi.

124
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,061
It's okay that
I'm coming, right.

125
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:36,061
Yeah, of course it's okay.

126
00:07:36,062 --> 00:07:37,129
You said you wanted to
come, I said it's fine.

127
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:37,930
Of course it's fine.

128
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:39,131
Wait, what?

129
00:07:39,132 --> 00:07:40,452
No, I didn't say
I wanted to come.

130
00:07:40,453 --> 00:07:42,293
I said that I wanted to
be there for you if you

131
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:43,537
wanted me to be there.

132
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:45,458
Why would I tell you to
come if I didn't want you

133
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:45,959
to come.

134
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,806
I am so sorry, but we're
out of premium-class

135
00:07:47,807 --> 00:07:49,042
vehicles.

136
00:07:49,043 --> 00:07:50,243
Could we interest you in one
of our more affordable models?

137
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:51,204
Yeah, yeah. That's fine.

138
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:52,679
Anything with
wheels is fine. Thanks.

139
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,114
I shouldn't be here.

140
00:07:55,115 --> 00:07:57,052
Babe...

141
00:07:58,052 --> 00:08:00,687
I.. I wouldn't have
said you should come...

142
00:08:37,258 --> 00:08:39,826
<i>I'm just saying it's
an objective truth.</i>

143
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:42,696
Japanese are the most
wacked-out people on earth.

144
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:44,630
Oh my God, you're like
an 8 year-old racist.

145
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:45,699
An 8 year-old racist...

146
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,660
Look, you cram that many
people on an island, it's

147
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,302
like a throbbing inbred
hothouse of cultural miasma.

148
00:08:50,303 --> 00:08:56,142
Frankly, I'm surprised
they don't have more fetishes.

149
00:08:56,143 --> 00:08:57,677
Oh shit.

150
00:08:57,678 --> 00:08:59,079
Ben Ben!

151
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,312
You came.

152
00:09:00,313 --> 00:09:04,917
Against my better
fucking judgment, I came.

153
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:05,918
Get the fuck over here.

154
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,322
How you doing?

155
00:09:09,322 --> 00:09:11,291
Ben, get my back here please.

156
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:13,092
We're not just going to
pretend with Alex like

157
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:14,661
nothing happened here, right?

158
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:15,894
What are you going to say?

159
00:09:15,895 --> 00:09:16,796
"Hey Alex.

160
00:09:16,797 --> 00:09:18,632
Interesting choice
to commit suicide."

161
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:20,367
Thank you, Ben.

162
00:09:20,368 --> 00:09:21,401
Excuse me.

163
00:09:21,402 --> 00:09:22,835
- Hi!
- Oh my God...

164
00:09:22,836 --> 00:09:24,676
I can't believe that you
have her side on this.

165
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:25,971
Hey, hey, hey.

166
00:09:25,972 --> 00:09:27,172
There are no sides.

167
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:29,808
Let's just let
this be about Alex.

168
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:30,909
Right?

169
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,812
And speaking of which, I
think we should watch him.

170
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:35,882
What?

171
00:09:35,883 --> 00:09:38,084
What, do you want to
set up like a monitoring system?

172
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:41,287
Yeah. Kind of, but it'd be
casual.

173
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:43,989
You know, tag in, tag out,
have somebody with him at

174
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,090
all times.

175
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:46,326
How about you go first.

176
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:47,393
You want to start?

177
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:48,161
This is ridiculous.

178
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:49,129
No it's not, Josh.

179
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:49,798
This, this is ridiculous.

180
00:09:49,998 --> 00:09:51,598
- Is this not ridiculous?
- I Googled it.

181
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:52,098
You what?

182
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:52,766
I Googled it.

183
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:54,167
Case in point.

184
00:09:54,168 --> 00:09:58,138
I'm gonna get some air.

185
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,076
Is there not air in here?

186
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:24,163
You came.

187
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:26,072
Of course I came.

188
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:33,239
How you feeling?

189
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,173
I'm good.

190
00:10:34,174 --> 00:10:37,109
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

191
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,282
I mean I, you know, considering.

192
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:43,182
Um, Alex look, about the call...

193
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:44,484
Don't, no no.

194
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:47,749
Don't tell me that we're having
a party in honor of my suicide.

195
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,391
Attempted suicide.

196
00:10:51,392 --> 00:10:55,499
Geez, if it were a suicide
we'd both be wearing suits.

197
00:10:58,438 --> 00:10:59,965
Can't treat it lightly, okay?

198
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:02,969
Maybe we should get
him a muffin basket.

199
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,138
I'm serious, the
first 48 hours...

200
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:05,640
Alex!

201
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,909
- Hi!
- Hey.

202
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:12,211
Jesus, Alex.

203
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:14,132
If you wanted to see all
of us, you could've just

204
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,634
shot us an email.

205
00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:20,887
Wow.

206
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,254
We were going to pick you up.

207
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:23,415
Oh, no, don't worry about it.

208
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,324
This was...

209
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:26,526
Easy.

210
00:11:26,527 --> 00:11:28,494
Well.

211
00:11:28,495 --> 00:11:29,362
Do you need anything?

212
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:30,864
Do you want to sit down?

213
00:11:30,865 --> 00:11:31,830
Um, I'm good.

214
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:32,671
- You're hungry?
- No.

215
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:34,152
Do you want me to
make you a sandwich?

216
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:36,869
Um...

217
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,139
No, I uh, actually I
think I'm going to go get

218
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,075
changed.

219
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:44,480
I feel a little gross,
you know what I mean?

220
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,449
Um, I'll keep you company.

221
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,886
Excuse me.

222
00:11:55,288 --> 00:11:58,258
Way to act normal, by the way.

223
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,926
Way to be an asshole.

224
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,362
Real nice, just...

225
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:04,163
Sandwich, what, you want
to offer him anything

226
00:12:04,164 --> 00:12:05,498
else?

227
00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:07,399
So why'd you leave LA?

228
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,070
Um, I don't know.

229
00:12:11,071 --> 00:12:16,042
I, I just, you know the
acting thing was only

230
00:12:16,043 --> 00:12:20,015
going okay, and the city's
a fucking soul killer.

231
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,983
Yeah, I was running out
of cash, my mom was in

232
00:12:23,984 --> 00:12:28,356
fucking Bali, my dad left me
this, and you were, you know...

233
00:12:30,356 --> 00:12:32,294
We kind of lost touch.

234
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,896
What I was going to say
outside, when you first came...

235
00:12:36,897 --> 00:12:40,499
Hey, the world's
got enough people.

236
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,237
You have to
explain yourself, too.

237
00:12:44,205 --> 00:12:46,572
Josh is still an asshole.

238
00:12:46,573 --> 00:12:48,533
If he's going to be like
this all weekend, I swear

239
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,209
to God...

240
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,476
He's just dealing
with it, you know.

241
00:12:51,477 --> 00:12:52,512
In his own way.

242
00:12:52,513 --> 00:12:54,513
And shouldn't Isaac know
there's no such thing as a

243
00:12:54,514 --> 00:12:58,951
+1 to a friend's attempted
suicide weekend thing?

244
00:12:58,952 --> 00:13:00,192
It's not a fucking Bar Mitzvah.

245
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:01,955
You know you sound like Josh.

246
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:03,089
Oh my God, you're right.

247
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,624
Ugh...

248
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:06,593
How are you?

249
00:13:06,594 --> 00:13:08,894
How are you and Ben?

250
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:10,463
We're fine.

251
00:13:10,464 --> 00:13:14,367
Okay, so, not so good fine.

252
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:17,903
What's going on?

253
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:18,904
Hey?

254
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:24,310
I'm late.

255
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:26,412
How late?

256
00:13:26,413 --> 00:13:28,582
Late late.

257
00:13:29,582 --> 00:13:31,884
Does Ben know?

258
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:33,190
Nope.

259
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,056
Hey.

260
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:37,357
Hi.

261
00:13:37,557 --> 00:13:38,391
How you doing?

262
00:13:38,392 --> 00:13:39,157
Good.

263
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:39,878
You need anything?

264
00:13:39,994 --> 00:13:41,060
No, I'm still fine.

265
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:42,262
What?

266
00:13:42,263 --> 00:13:42,830
Here.

267
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,931
Hey, where's the
bathroom in here?

268
00:13:45,932 --> 00:13:47,133
Use the one upstairs.

269
00:13:47,134 --> 00:13:48,168
Trust me.

270
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:53,672
Isaac is calling.

271
00:13:53,673 --> 00:13:57,476
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

272
00:13:57,477 --> 00:13:58,444
<i>Really?</i>

273
00:13:58,445 --> 00:14:00,412
Can your +1 not use a GPS?

274
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:02,940
I thought young people
were good at those things.

275
00:14:03,317 --> 00:14:05,086
Be nice, Sarah.

276
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:08,023
Isaac is close, but lost.

277
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:09,591
You know what?

278
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,291
I'll just drive
out and meet him.

279
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:12,532
I'm gonna go get some firewood.

280
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:13,613
I'm gonna go pee in nature.

281
00:14:13,614 --> 00:14:15,146
I'll stay and watch Alex.

282
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:20,166
I mean I'll...

283
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:23,302
Put on some pasta for dinner.

284
00:14:23,303 --> 00:14:24,170
That sound good?

285
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:26,973
That sounds great.

286
00:14:26,974 --> 00:14:28,106
You want to come with me?

287
00:14:28,107 --> 00:14:29,142
Yeah, I'll come with you.

288
00:14:29,143 --> 00:14:30,283
Great.

289
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:39,719
You clearly have no idea
what you're doing, do you?

290
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,727
Fuck you.

291
00:14:47,727 --> 00:14:49,195
Here, give me it.

292
00:14:49,196 --> 00:14:50,442
I know.

293
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:04,344
Let me try again.

294
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:06,112
No.

295
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:06,613
No?

296
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,480
No.

297
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:11,484
I thought you all of calc
21, and then you went off

298
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:14,153
and you did better
than me on the exam.

299
00:15:14,154 --> 00:15:16,422
I'm not teaching you
how to chop wood.

300
00:15:16,423 --> 00:15:18,423
It's not my fault you
have performance anxiety.

301
00:15:18,424 --> 00:15:20,230
I perform just fine.

302
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,231
You don't have to
cook, you know.

303
00:15:26,232 --> 00:15:27,032
It's okay.

304
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:29,701
It's the only thing
that relaxes me.

305
00:15:29,702 --> 00:15:32,471
Really?

306
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:34,040
It's just...

307
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:37,677
Been a while since
I've seen everyone.

308
00:15:37,678 --> 00:15:39,518
You know, if you need to
get something off your

309
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,446
chest, you should...

310
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:45,118
I don't need you of all
people to give me advice on...

311
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:46,585
I'm sorry.

312
00:15:46,586 --> 00:15:48,488
No, it's...

313
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,489
I didn't mean that.

314
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,330
It's a fair point.

315
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:01,300
What?

316
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:02,201
They...

317
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:04,202
Are here.

318
00:16:04,203 --> 00:16:05,772
Oh.

319
00:16:05,773 --> 00:16:09,776
She's hot.

320
00:16:09,777 --> 00:16:11,076
Your...

321
00:16:11,077 --> 00:16:12,177
Your boobs are bigger.

322
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:13,350
That's not true.

323
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,550
That's not true.

324
00:16:17,551 --> 00:16:20,222
Ugh.

325
00:16:23,222 --> 00:16:24,322
No they're not.

326
00:16:24,323 --> 00:16:25,792
Hey!

327
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:27,493
Look who I found.

328
00:16:27,494 --> 00:16:28,661
Hey handsome.

329
00:16:28,662 --> 00:16:30,363
Oh, you didn't have to fly all
the way across the country.

330
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,644
Are you kidding me? I wanted to.

331
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:32,330
Alex, Kate.

332
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:34,133
Kate, Alex.

333
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:36,502
Hey, I-I've heard
a lot about you.

334
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:37,769
I've heard a lot about you.

335
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,339
What the fuck are those?

336
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,475
That's how you say "hi" now?

337
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:44,343
They're shiny and pointy.

338
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:45,544
They're Italian, motherfucker.

339
00:16:45,545 --> 00:16:46,982
You look like a lumberjack.

340
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:50,929
Oh, dude, if you'd told us
you were coming out of the

341
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,068
closet we could've
thrown you a party.

342
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:55,354
I told you my
friends are awesome.

343
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:57,590
Um, is there a
bathroom I could-

344
00:16:57,591 --> 00:16:59,524
upstairs!

345
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:03,296
Dinner is almost ready.

346
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:04,463
Hey.

347
00:17:04,464 --> 00:17:05,464
Yeah.

348
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:18,111
Sarah, this pasta is delicious.

349
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:21,314
Mm, it is pasta and
sauce from a can.

350
00:17:21,315 --> 00:17:23,816
Tomorrow, I'll make
something real.

351
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:26,451
Instagram tells me you're
still cooking a lot.

352
00:17:26,452 --> 00:17:28,386
Instagram lies.

353
00:17:28,387 --> 00:17:30,489
Unless Ramen counts.

354
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,225
So that's what being
a lawyer's like.

355
00:17:32,226 --> 00:17:33,293
Fulfilling all your
hopes and dreams?

356
00:17:33,294 --> 00:17:35,361
Not all of us can stand to
destroy the planet on the

357
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:36,828
backs of hedge funds.

358
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:38,730
<i>That's not what I meant.</i>

359
00:17:38,731 --> 00:17:41,566
I'm just saying, look, we
graduated, aside, aside

360
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:45,304
from you, at the onset of
the worst recession in 80 years.

361
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:47,772
History says that most of
us will never regain the

362
00:17:47,773 --> 00:17:50,509
income levels that we
might have otherwise enjoyed.

363
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:56,481
Isaac here is a beautiful anomaly,
and for that, we salute him.

364
00:17:56,482 --> 00:17:57,549
Thanks pal.

365
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,818
Appreciate it.

366
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:02,622
How's the uh, how's your
PhD going?

367
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,588
<i>Mm.</i>

368
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:04,856
What's that supposed to mean?

369
00:18:04,857 --> 00:18:06,225
It's just a simple question.

370
00:18:06,226 --> 00:18:07,293
Nah, it's had subtext.

371
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,393
Oh, you want the subtext?

372
00:18:08,394 --> 00:18:09,554
Of course I want the subtext.

373
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,995
Don't you know who
you're talking to?

374
00:18:10,996 --> 00:18:12,331
Did you forget who I am?

375
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:14,332
<i>Okay, so how's life up on
your academic high horse,</i>

376
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:17,435
uh, looking down on the
rest of us and despairing

377
00:18:17,436 --> 00:18:19,740
about the decline
of our culture?

378
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,677
It's comments like those,
Isaac, that make me despair.

379
00:18:24,678 --> 00:18:26,718
Actually, Josh, sorry, but
I'd like to know what the

380
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:28,581
hell you're doing there too.

381
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:31,214
<i>Yeah, all joking aside,
what are you writing about?</i>

382
00:18:32,596 --> 00:18:34,754
I'm writing about the
future of biography.

383
00:18:34,755 --> 00:18:39,691
How our ever-expanding
digital footprint, emails,

384
00:18:39,692 --> 00:18:44,297
texts, tweets, will inform
our understanding of

385
00:18:44,298 --> 00:18:45,864
history and ourselves.

386
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:47,633
Which is ironic.

387
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:48,834
Why?

388
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:51,903
Because I hate the modern world.

389
00:18:51,904 --> 00:18:53,972
Which era would you
rather have lived in?

390
00:18:53,973 --> 00:18:55,874
I'm sorry, what was
your name again?

391
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:56,642
<i>It was Kate?</i>

392
00:18:56,643 --> 00:18:57,643
- Kate? Kate.
- Josh...

393
00:18:57,644 --> 00:18:59,364
I'm just saying,
I'm sorry. It's Kate? Kate?

394
00:18:59,365 --> 00:18:59,679
Yeah.

395
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,520
<i>The only thing I hate
more than the present is</i>

396
00:19:01,521 --> 00:19:02,894
nostalgia for the past.

397
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:09,161
Hey, you don't have to do that.

398
00:19:09,162 --> 00:19:10,456
No, no let me do something.

399
00:19:10,457 --> 00:19:11,324
Nope!

400
00:19:11,325 --> 00:19:12,525
You want to take shifts?

401
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,595
He's compensating for the
fact that he can't chop wood.

402
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:17,156
Oh my God, when'd you
get so mean, Josh?

403
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,698
You're so mean.

404
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,767
Probably the same time you
traded in for those shoes.

405
00:19:21,768 --> 00:19:24,168
This whole footwear smear campaign
is really cutting me deep.

406
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:24,897
It's a real shame.

407
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:26,674
Maybe you should commit suicide.

408
00:19:28,674 --> 00:19:30,508
What?

409
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:31,876
Is it too s-
Alex is laughing.

410
00:19:31,877 --> 00:19:34,247
Look at that.

411
00:19:34,248 --> 00:19:35,750
That's a good joke.

412
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,329
So how did you and Isaac meet?

413
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:40,752
Mm...

414
00:19:40,753 --> 00:19:42,255
It's embarrassing.

415
00:19:42,256 --> 00:19:43,323
Why?

416
00:19:43,324 --> 00:19:46,925
Well, I was an, I was an
intern at his office, but

417
00:19:46,926 --> 00:19:49,562
we didn't start dating
until after I left, of course.

418
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,430
Of course.

419
00:19:51,431 --> 00:19:53,403
I think it's sweet.

420
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,870
Hey, I found two.

421
00:19:57,871 --> 00:19:59,639
Great.

422
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,876
Thanks.

423
00:20:03,876 --> 00:20:05,810
So are you going
to go with that?

424
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:06,811
Uh...

425
00:20:07,314 --> 00:20:09,634
There's a whole chapter
devoted to hair implants.

426
00:20:09,635 --> 00:20:10,875
You have to do it in his voice.

427
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,586
Or, no. Exhibit B: The mature
man's guide to style.

428
00:20:14,587 --> 00:20:15,820
Oh my God, do not move.

429
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:17,456
Hold that up right now.

430
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:20,459
Please, just pose
with the cover please.

431
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,594
Oh yeah.

432
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,555
<i>Would you like to hear
the section on hair plugs?</i>

433
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,699
How's your novel, Ben?

434
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,433
It's good.

435
00:20:28,434 --> 00:20:30,335
It'll be done soon.

436
00:20:30,336 --> 00:20:34,573
Is it better or worse
than your New York story?

437
00:20:34,574 --> 00:20:37,809
It is, without a doubt, longer.

438
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:38,911
<i>God, I loved that story.</i>

439
00:20:38,912 --> 00:20:40,578
It was so good.

440
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:42,547
It's the only reason
Siri went out with me.

441
00:20:42,548 --> 00:20:43,481
That's not true.

442
00:20:43,482 --> 00:20:44,249
That's true.

443
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,750
<i>- That's not true.</i>
- It's true.

444
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:47,321
Maybe a little bit.

445
00:20:48,321 --> 00:20:52,658
I think I still
have a copy here.

446
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:54,326
You know what we should do?

447
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:56,595
We should stage a
dramatic reading.

448
00:20:56,596 --> 00:20:57,997
That is not going to happen.

449
00:20:57,998 --> 00:20:59,498
Can you imagine?

450
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:00,966
Everybody would participate.

451
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:02,802
I'll be the roommate,
you could play...

452
00:21:03,002 --> 00:21:05,410
Josh, really it's fine.

453
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,110
Sarah.

454
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:11,712
What?

455
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:13,597
Enough with the
fucking pictures.

456
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:16,716
I'm sorry, I'm recording
this for posterity.

457
00:21:16,717 --> 00:21:17,549
Is that okay?

458
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,284
By what?

459
00:21:18,285 --> 00:21:19,445
By ruining it in the present?

460
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:20,819
No, that's your job.

461
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,886
Okay, come on.

462
00:21:21,887 --> 00:21:23,088
Hold on, hold on.

463
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:23,691
That's okay.

464
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:25,171
Sarah, let me ask you something.

465
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:26,726
What?

466
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:28,927
What, what are you going
to do with these pictures, huh?

467
00:21:29,028 --> 00:21:31,764
Are you going to post
them on Facebook?

468
00:21:31,765 --> 00:21:32,698
I don't know, maybe.

469
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:33,766
Would that make you mad?

470
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:34,847
<i>You're clinically obsessed.</i>

471
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,808
I like to see what
my friends are up to. Big deal.

472
00:21:37,002 --> 00:21:39,505
So what, your news feed
tells you that Isaac got a

473
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:43,441
new pair of Italian
loafers or Ben, Ben wrote

474
00:21:43,442 --> 00:21:45,377
a, a funny headline for
the post, and that makes

475
00:21:45,378 --> 00:21:46,879
you feel like you
still know somebody?

476
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,449
Yeah, kind of, because
that's what people do now, Josh.

477
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,784
People who care, at least.

478
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:53,545
Well, you know what,
I'm sorry, but maybe I'd

479
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:55,546
rather be in the fucking
dark as to what people are

480
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,989
up to than mistake some
false level of intimacy

481
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,424
for friendship.

482
00:21:59,425 --> 00:22:00,526
That is such bullshit.

483
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,594
We're still friends.

484
00:22:01,595 --> 00:22:04,829
Isaac is on his BlackBerry
sending emails to San

485
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,164
Francisco right now.

486
00:22:06,165 --> 00:22:07,900
Enough. Isaac...

487
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:08,934
Yeah?

488
00:22:08,935 --> 00:22:12,505
Remember when I got
stoned for the first time?

489
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:14,507
When we went to the
natural history museum?

490
00:22:14,508 --> 00:22:15,775
I remember you freaking out.

491
00:22:15,776 --> 00:22:16,910
<i>Yeah.</i>

492
00:22:16,911 --> 00:22:21,079
And you had to make me
dance and make me feel better?

493
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,783
And you did the devil dance?

494
00:22:23,784 --> 00:22:24,517
Oh my God.

495
00:22:24,518 --> 00:22:25,518
<i>Devil dance.
Devil dance?</i>

496
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,554
- I totally
<i>- it's my favorite thing.</i>

497
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,155
I thought you hated dancing.

498
00:22:30,156 --> 00:22:33,691
Isaac doesn't d-, Isaac dances.

499
00:22:33,692 --> 00:22:36,095
Okay, so what was
Isaac like in college?

500
00:22:36,096 --> 00:22:36,762
Dorky.

501
00:22:36,962 --> 00:22:37,930
Uncultured.

502
00:22:37,931 --> 00:22:39,964
Pretty much exactly
what he is right now.

503
00:22:39,965 --> 00:22:40,965
I was pretty dorky.

504
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,035
Okay, so you were
really adorable.

505
00:22:43,036 --> 00:22:45,008
Yeah, thanks.

506
00:22:48,008 --> 00:22:50,476
So what do you do, Kate?

507
00:22:50,477 --> 00:22:52,611
I work at a suicide and
crisis hotline for teens

508
00:22:52,612 --> 00:22:53,750
in the bay area.

509
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,270
That sounded strange. I'm
sorry, I didn't realize

510
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:00,719
until it came out of my mouth.

511
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,000
Shame I didn't have your number.

512
00:23:02,001 --> 00:23:04,369
You could've solved
all my problems.

513
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,634
Why did you lie?

514
00:23:16,635 --> 00:23:18,737
When?

515
00:23:18,738 --> 00:23:22,173
Alex, about the book.

516
00:23:22,174 --> 00:23:24,477
I didn't lie.

517
00:23:24,478 --> 00:23:27,048
I said the book will be
done soon and it will.

518
00:23:28,048 --> 00:23:30,482
Why not just say it's
still in research.

519
00:23:30,483 --> 00:23:31,550
Just, you know?

520
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:34,920
Because maybe this weekend
isn't about my problems.

521
00:23:34,921 --> 00:23:37,155
If you want to schedule
some time to do that, we can

522
00:23:37,156 --> 00:23:38,893
find it.

523
00:23:39,893 --> 00:23:41,927
She seems really sweet.

524
00:23:41,928 --> 00:23:43,562
Stop it.

525
00:23:43,563 --> 00:23:46,798
Tell us all about your
illicit office romance.

526
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,866
Hmm?

527
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:49,067
You're being so annoying.

528
00:23:49,068 --> 00:23:50,870
Did you play naughty intern?

529
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:51,871
That's not what happened.

530
00:23:52,005 --> 00:23:53,972
What, I think it's hot.

531
00:23:53,973 --> 00:23:55,508
Go to sleep.

532
00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:56,469
All of you, go to sleep.

533
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,742
Get out of here.

534
00:23:57,743 --> 00:23:59,210
I'm ready to go to sleep.

535
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:00,211
<i>I'm over it.</i>

536
00:24:00,212 --> 00:24:02,917
I'll go with you.

537
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:05,718
Good night.

538
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:06,518
Good night.

539
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,252
Night guys.

540
00:24:07,253 --> 00:24:09,822
Night.

541
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,690
Just gonna hang out?

542
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:14,093
How many times does she
wake up during the night?

543
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:16,014
Like do you have to feed
her, like, I don't know,

544
00:24:16,028 --> 00:24:17,829
hour and a half?

545
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,831
You're such an asshole.

546
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,592
Cause my friend, I have
some friends who have

547
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:22,902
kids, and they say
it's like Vietnam.

548
00:24:22,903 --> 00:24:24,539
<i>Go fuck yourself.</i>

549
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:29,941
He had been calling me a lot.

550
00:24:29,942 --> 00:24:31,876
Mm?

551
00:24:31,877 --> 00:24:35,980
Alex...

552
00:24:35,981 --> 00:24:45,981
Not too much to talk
about, just checking in.

553
00:24:45,991 --> 00:24:49,029
Always asking about the book.

554
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
"How's the book?

555
00:24:50,963 --> 00:24:51,803
How's the book going?

556
00:24:51,804 --> 00:24:53,911
How you doing
on the book?"

557
00:24:58,805 --> 00:25:02,945
Got to the point where I
was screening his calls.

558
00:25:10,584 --> 00:25:12,353
The taste in my
mouth, it's good.

559
00:25:13,353 --> 00:25:14,353
Agh!

560
00:25:35,008 --> 00:25:38,177
Isn't it so funny how
we're all breathing under

561
00:25:38,178 --> 00:25:39,878
the same roof again.

562
00:25:41,181 --> 00:25:44,350
Do you ever wish we
could just go back?

563
00:25:44,351 --> 00:25:47,385
Sometimes.

564
00:25:47,386 --> 00:25:49,287
Actually, no I don't.

565
00:25:49,288 --> 00:25:50,722
I really don't.

566
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:51,656
Why?

567
00:25:51,657 --> 00:25:52,691
Not at all.

568
00:25:52,692 --> 00:25:54,826
Because I...

569
00:25:54,827 --> 00:25:59,864
I don't know, I guess I
was mainly just scared.

570
00:25:59,865 --> 00:26:00,732
Of what?

571
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,901
Of you all.

572
00:26:02,902 --> 00:26:04,937
The possibility that
you didn't like me.

573
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,204
That's ridiculous.

574
00:26:06,205 --> 00:26:07,172
It's the truth.

575
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:12,076
I remember that that
feeling did not go away.

576
00:26:12,077 --> 00:26:16,347
Until, um, until junior
year when Ben had me at

577
00:26:16,348 --> 00:26:20,285
his parents' place for Easter.

578
00:26:20,286 --> 00:26:21,953
We took the train
there and back.

579
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:25,824
Barely talked, but you
know, it was, it was

580
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:26,959
better than talking.

581
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,831
It was just...

582
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,711
Just nice.

583
00:26:45,711 --> 00:26:48,413
Hm?

584
00:26:48,414 --> 00:26:52,418
I don't know how to say this.

585
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:57,221
But, have you ever thought
about going to therapy?

586
00:26:57,222 --> 00:27:00,058
Because, I've done
it a lot, and...

587
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:00,594
You have?

588
00:27:00,794 --> 00:27:01,294
Yeah.

589
00:27:01,295 --> 00:27:03,929
Why?

590
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:04,863
Seriously?

591
00:27:04,864 --> 00:27:05,998
Yeah, you're fine.

592
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:12,037
Oh, um, let me think, how
I'm constantly anxious and

593
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:16,874
I can never pinpoint why,
and how ever since college

594
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:19,812
I can only be with guys
who are assholes or

595
00:27:19,813 --> 00:27:21,747
married or both...

596
00:27:21,748 --> 00:27:23,281
Has the therapy helped?

597
00:27:23,282 --> 00:27:25,284
I mean, I take Xanax now.

598
00:27:25,285 --> 00:27:29,254
That helps, and also, you
know, the other stuff is

599
00:27:29,255 --> 00:27:30,154
helpful.

600
00:27:30,155 --> 00:27:31,675
It's through, it's
complicated, though.

601
00:27:31,676 --> 00:27:34,226
My therapist kind of
thinks that it's very deep

602
00:27:34,227 --> 00:27:38,764
rooted in my childhood and...

603
00:27:38,765 --> 00:27:42,034
I'm s-sorry I'm
talking about myself.

604
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,067
I'm so self-absorbed.

605
00:27:43,068 --> 00:27:44,236
This is why I'm in therapy.

606
00:27:44,237 --> 00:27:45,237
No it isn't!

607
00:27:45,238 --> 00:27:46,070
No it isn't.

608
00:27:46,071 --> 00:27:48,806
You just need sleep.

609
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:50,976
I know, but are you okay?

610
00:27:50,977 --> 00:27:53,912
Do you need something
right now before we go to sleep?

611
00:27:53,913 --> 00:27:57,850
Sarah, you're going to have
to stop asking me that, okay?

612
00:27:57,851 --> 00:28:00,152
Mmm...

613
00:28:00,153 --> 00:28:02,254
You're very nice.

614
00:28:02,255 --> 00:28:05,356
Well, I think you're doing
a really good job, and I'm

615
00:28:05,357 --> 00:28:07,726
just going to wait here
until you fall asleep.

616
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:14,866
Alright, forget it.

617
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,804
Good night, thank you.

618
00:28:18,805 --> 00:28:20,506
I'm glad you're here.

619
00:28:20,507 --> 00:28:23,040
Isaac.

620
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:24,409
Isaac.

621
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:24,910
Isaac!

622
00:28:24,978 --> 00:28:26,044
Uh huh?

623
00:28:26,045 --> 00:28:27,445
You're awake?

624
00:28:27,446 --> 00:28:30,250
Unh...

625
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,452
What do you like about me?

626
00:28:34,453 --> 00:28:35,354
What?

627
00:28:35,355 --> 00:28:37,489
You waited too long.

628
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,392
Baby, it's the
middle of the light.

629
00:28:40,393 --> 00:28:42,273
Well now, now I can't
trust what you say because

630
00:28:42,274 --> 00:28:45,329
it didn't just come to you.

631
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:49,268
Wait can we, can we just
talk about this in the morning?

632
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,909
No, we can't talk about
it in the morning.

633
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:54,272
I think, I think your
friends think I'm...

634
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:56,074
Stupid and young.

635
00:28:56,075 --> 00:28:58,075
They don't think you're
stupid or young.

636
00:28:58,076 --> 00:28:58,994
You're neither.

637
00:28:59,011 --> 00:29:00,077
Go back to sleep.

638
00:29:00,078 --> 00:29:01,512
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

639
00:29:01,513 --> 00:29:04,088
But...

640
00:29:10,088 --> 00:29:11,222
Oh, hey.

641
00:29:11,223 --> 00:29:12,924
Hi.

642
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:14,828
Oh, you know what I
wanted to tell you?

643
00:29:15,028 --> 00:29:16,268
What's that show that you like?

644
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:18,831
The one with, with all the
ladies and they're in a city.

645
00:29:18,832 --> 00:29:19,832
What is it? What is that?

646
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:20,700
The real housewives?

647
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:21,666
- Yeah, I don't
- the real housewives.

648
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:23,468
No, no, no, but I was
watching that show.

649
00:29:23,469 --> 00:29:24,568
No you weren't.

650
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:27,605
No, it was on, and I was
there, and I couldn't look

651
00:29:27,606 --> 00:29:28,926
away, and do you
want to know why?

652
00:29:28,927 --> 00:29:29,842
Oh, shut up.

653
00:29:29,843 --> 00:29:31,210
Sarah, do you want to know why?

654
00:29:31,211 --> 00:29:33,879
Because I realized why you
love that show so much.

655
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:39,489
Because at its core, it's
about the human condition.

656
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:44,155
No.

657
00:29:44,156 --> 00:29:45,469
What?

658
00:30:00,405 --> 00:30:02,374
I thought they hated each other.

659
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:03,441
They do and they don't.

660
00:30:03,442 --> 00:30:05,411
It's like a weird
game they play.

661
00:30:06,546 --> 00:30:09,647
Your friends are fucked up.

662
00:30:09,648 --> 00:30:12,184
They prefer complicated.

663
00:30:16,388 --> 00:30:17,623
Sarah and Josh.

664
00:30:17,624 --> 00:30:25,502
Just like old times.

665
00:30:30,502 --> 00:30:32,938
I wonder why I let
this keep happening.

666
00:30:32,939 --> 00:30:33,739
I don't know, Sarah.

667
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,374
Maybe because you want it to.

668
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,343
No, it's just something
I think I want and then

669
00:30:38,344 --> 00:30:44,082
later I feel awful about.

670
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,116
You alright?

671
00:30:45,117 --> 00:30:46,117
Yes.

672
00:30:46,118 --> 00:30:49,287
Are Ben and Siri acting
weird, or is it just me?

673
00:30:49,288 --> 00:30:50,956
It's just you.

674
00:30:50,957 --> 00:30:52,490
You think they heard us?

675
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:53,624
How would I know?

676
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:54,459
Well, I don't know.

677
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,228
She's a light
sleeper, that Siri.

678
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,461
And you're very loud.

679
00:30:57,462 --> 00:30:58,563
You've gotten louder.

680
00:30:58,564 --> 00:31:01,266
What is that supposed
to mean "she's a light sleeper?"

681
00:31:01,267 --> 00:31:02,334
Oh, I thought you were
talking about the fact

682
00:31:02,335 --> 00:31:03,235
that you got louder.

683
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,671
I don't, you know,
remember in college with

684
00:31:05,672 --> 00:31:07,605
those dorky little
orange earbuds?

685
00:31:07,606 --> 00:31:09,708
And she will still
complain about being woken

686
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:11,943
up by the church bells?

687
00:31:11,944 --> 00:31:12,944
You're still in love with her.

688
00:31:12,945 --> 00:31:14,185
I'm not still in love with her.

689
00:31:14,186 --> 00:31:14,780
Yes you are.

690
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,048
I'm not still in
love with her, Sarah.

691
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:20,052
I just find it fascinating
that Ben seems to get

692
00:31:20,053 --> 00:31:21,620
everything that
he wants in life?

693
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:23,555
Can I ask you a question?

694
00:31:23,556 --> 00:31:25,316
Where do you get off
thinking the whole world

695
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,686
is conspiring against you?

696
00:31:27,026 --> 00:31:28,360
You want to go again?

697
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:29,126
No.

698
00:31:29,127 --> 00:31:29,762
What?

699
00:31:29,962 --> 00:31:30,562
You're a dick.

700
00:31:30,563 --> 00:31:31,496
Yeah.

701
00:31:31,497 --> 00:31:33,131
All men are dicks, Sarah.

702
00:31:33,132 --> 00:31:34,432
We're hardwired that way.

703
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:36,233
Yeah, but you're a dick
who thinks he's better

704
00:31:36,234 --> 00:31:38,069
than a dick because he
can back up his dickish

705
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,672
behavior with psychobabble
and pseudoscience.

706
00:31:40,673 --> 00:31:42,106
Yeah, blah blah blah blah blah.

707
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:43,040
Let's go again.

708
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:44,041
I don't want to.

709
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:45,762
I think it would be a
good idea to go again.

710
00:31:45,763 --> 00:31:47,045
You can't go again.

711
00:31:47,046 --> 00:31:48,166
I can go again.

712
00:32:16,506 --> 00:32:19,243
<i>There are three stages
of finding friends in college.</i>

713
00:32:19,244 --> 00:32:21,445
<i>The first is desperation.</i>

714
00:32:21,446 --> 00:32:23,547
<i>Second is panic.</i>

715
00:32:23,548 --> 00:32:26,785
<i>The third is fate.</i>

716
00:32:26,786 --> 00:32:28,506
<i>When you wind up at
the same table together</i>

717
00:32:28,507 --> 00:32:31,233
<i>somehow, then your
real life begins.</i>

718
00:32:54,113 --> 00:32:55,615
Busted!

719
00:32:58,785 --> 00:33:00,419
Does everyone else know.

720
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,453
Paper-thin walls.

721
00:33:02,454 --> 00:33:05,656
Perfect.

722
00:33:05,657 --> 00:33:07,793
No one is judging.

723
00:33:07,794 --> 00:33:10,194
Ugh, besides me.

724
00:33:10,195 --> 00:33:14,066
It's like I'm this mature,
successful, adult woman,

725
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:15,947
except when I'm with Josh,
it's like I'm back in

726
00:33:15,948 --> 00:33:18,702
sophomore year and I'm
just total insecure, and...

727
00:33:18,703 --> 00:33:19,604
It's complicated.

728
00:33:19,605 --> 00:33:21,440
He was your first.

729
00:33:21,441 --> 00:33:22,641
It's not complicated.

730
00:33:22,642 --> 00:33:23,808
He's using me.

731
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:26,178
Who's to say you
aren't using him?

732
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:28,547
My therapist, actually.

733
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:32,584
Josh is a man-child who
uses sex, I'm serious, as

734
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:36,121
a means of processing
deep-seated emotional issues.

735
00:33:36,122 --> 00:33:38,457
And you are an overworked
tax attorney who could

736
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:39,490
stand to get laid.

737
00:33:39,491 --> 00:33:41,460
I'm a...

738
00:33:41,461 --> 00:33:43,381
Mergers and acquisitions
attorney who could stand

739
00:33:43,382 --> 00:33:45,329
to get laid, thank you.

740
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,097
Whatever.

741
00:33:46,098 --> 00:33:47,239
Are you still...

742
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,706
With...

743
00:33:54,707 --> 00:33:58,815
I think I might be a little...

744
00:34:02,815 --> 00:34:04,316
What?

745
00:34:04,317 --> 00:34:06,218
You don't run.

746
00:34:06,219 --> 00:34:07,619
Well, I'm thinking
of picking it up.

747
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,920
Alex, you're still recovering.

748
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,221
Why don't you take it easy?

749
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:13,125
I can always stop.

750
00:34:13,126 --> 00:34:16,495
I have been trying to get
motivated all morning.

751
00:34:16,496 --> 00:34:17,495
Come with me.

752
00:34:17,496 --> 00:34:19,730
Yeah?

753
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:21,198
How'd you sleep?

754
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,533
Fine, why?

755
00:34:22,534 --> 00:34:24,268
Really?

756
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:26,309
Just wanted to make
sure you weren't being attacked.

757
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,640
- There was a lot of...
- God.

758
00:34:29,641 --> 00:34:30,774
So how's Brooklyn?

759
00:34:30,775 --> 00:34:32,377
It's fine.

760
00:34:32,378 --> 00:34:33,812
Come visit.

761
00:34:33,813 --> 00:34:35,347
Sorry, sorry sorry.

762
00:34:36,481 --> 00:34:37,616
You okay?

763
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:41,685
Yeah.

764
00:34:41,686 --> 00:34:44,488
You'd better be fine.

765
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:48,359
I um, I saw the pictures
you posted the other day.

766
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,395
Yeah?

767
00:34:49,396 --> 00:34:51,316
Uh, were you and Ben went
to all the thrift shops

768
00:34:51,317 --> 00:34:51,863
and...

769
00:34:51,864 --> 00:34:54,265
Made your place
look so home-like?

770
00:34:54,266 --> 00:34:55,433
Yeah.

771
00:34:55,434 --> 00:34:56,901
Yeah I did.

772
00:34:56,902 --> 00:35:00,407
Now all you need is
a golden retriever.

773
00:35:02,407 --> 00:35:05,609
What?

774
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,645
What's going on?

775
00:35:07,646 --> 00:35:09,547
I got a job offer in LA.

776
00:35:09,548 --> 00:35:10,948
<i>Alright!</i>

777
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:12,517
It's a dream kind of offer.

778
00:35:12,518 --> 00:35:14,886
That's great.

779
00:35:14,887 --> 00:35:19,457
So then what's the bad news?

780
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:22,560
Ben's been resisting
at every turn.

781
00:35:22,561 --> 00:35:25,596
Fighting a lot about
going, fighting about

782
00:35:25,597 --> 00:35:29,667
staying, just, we haven't
even made love in...

783
00:35:29,668 --> 00:35:30,901
Weeks, and.

784
00:35:30,902 --> 00:35:32,971
Didn't need to know that part.

785
00:35:32,972 --> 00:35:36,376
I'm sorry, I...

786
00:35:37,298 --> 00:35:39,877
I just think some space
would be good for us both.

787
00:35:39,878 --> 00:35:42,684
Wait, wait, no, no, um...

788
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,285
You and Ben are
going to be fine.

789
00:35:47,286 --> 00:35:48,220
Okay?

790
00:35:48,221 --> 00:35:49,901
Ben's probably just
stressed out right now.

791
00:35:49,902 --> 00:35:50,834
He'll figure it out.

792
00:35:50,835 --> 00:35:53,658
He'll finish his book and...

793
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:55,627
What?

794
00:35:55,628 --> 00:35:58,629
Ben is...

795
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:03,834
Well, for starters he's blocked.

796
00:36:03,835 --> 00:36:05,837
Blocked?

797
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:10,442
Please, don't say
anything, obviously.

798
00:36:10,443 --> 00:36:12,707
He hasn't written
anything in almost a year.

799
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:19,850
Ha ha, look who it is.

800
00:36:19,851 --> 00:36:21,819
It's about time, you lazy bum.

801
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,388
Lazy?

802
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:27,527
It's not like you let
me sleep, you and Sarah.

803
00:36:28,527 --> 00:36:30,428
How's Siri?

804
00:36:30,429 --> 00:36:33,531
Siri...

805
00:36:33,532 --> 00:36:35,500
Is on a run.

806
00:36:35,501 --> 00:36:37,474
Okay.

807
00:36:41,474 --> 00:36:42,474
And she's back.

808
00:36:43,009 --> 00:36:45,810
Ben, can I ask you something?

809
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:50,982
Was it difficult, as a couple,
when the iPhone 4s came out?

810
00:36:50,983 --> 00:36:54,618
Because I can imagine,
here you are, minding your

811
00:36:54,619 --> 00:37:01,994
own business, and then everybody's
asking her a question.

812
00:37:02,994 --> 00:37:04,967
You're a fucking idiot.

813
00:37:07,967 --> 00:37:08,799
<i>Just a second!</i>

814
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
Oh.

815
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,707
It's all yours.

816
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:17,509
Thank you.

817
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,811
Hey, um...

818
00:37:19,811 --> 00:37:22,413
I'm sorry about what
I said last night.

819
00:37:22,414 --> 00:37:22,914
I'm...

820
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:24,049
It's okay.

821
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,183
Don't worry.

822
00:37:25,184 --> 00:37:27,551
You're not even 48 hours
removed from a traumatic event.

823
00:37:27,552 --> 00:37:29,872
You're suddenly the center
of love and attention and you're

824
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,823
feeling mildly manic
and also oddly angry.

825
00:37:31,824 --> 00:37:33,664
I imagine you're also
experiencing mood-cycling

826
00:37:33,665 --> 00:37:35,585
and you're scared as hell
of the next time you'll

827
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,727
crash, so, no.

828
00:37:36,728 --> 00:37:38,465
I'm not taking it personally.

829
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:39,965
Good.

830
00:37:40,032 --> 00:37:41,433
Don't worry, though.

831
00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:43,681
You'll level off.

832
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:57,915
What, uh...

833
00:37:57,916 --> 00:37:59,651
What style of yoga is that?

834
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,989
What, what form is that?

835
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:08,526
I took a yoga class once.

836
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:10,677
Yeah, but it wasn't for me.

837
00:38:25,677 --> 00:38:27,748
No, yeah, uh, mhmm.

838
00:38:29,748 --> 00:38:31,433
I'm going to give
you some space.

839
00:38:35,121 --> 00:38:36,227
You know what I miss?

840
00:38:36,228 --> 00:38:38,522
I miss living down
the hall from you.

841
00:38:38,523 --> 00:38:40,825
I could always pop over
whenever I wanted to talk.

842
00:38:40,826 --> 00:38:42,526
You just hate sleeping
alone and you needed

843
00:38:42,527 --> 00:38:44,729
somebody to talk to about Josh.

844
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,464
Don't be naive.

845
00:38:46,465 --> 00:38:50,834
Don't be naive about what?

846
00:38:50,835 --> 00:38:52,470
Isaac...

847
00:38:52,471 --> 00:38:54,671
Sarah...

848
00:38:54,672 --> 00:38:58,010
I always wanted
you to make a move.

849
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:01,414
That's funny.

850
00:39:02,414 --> 00:39:05,517
I'm serious.

851
00:39:05,518 --> 00:39:06,852
But you always,

852
00:39:06,853 --> 00:39:10,455
you always said that we shouldn't
because were such good friends.

853
00:39:10,456 --> 00:39:15,526
Oh, yes, that is what I
said, but that is not what

854
00:39:15,527 --> 00:39:16,527
I wanted.

855
00:39:17,846 --> 00:39:19,531
You're impossible,
you know that?

856
00:39:19,532 --> 00:39:20,265
I'm impossible?

857
00:39:20,266 --> 00:39:21,899
Yeah, you're totally impossible.

858
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,767
You're impossible!

859
00:39:23,768 --> 00:39:25,470
Shit!

860
00:39:25,471 --> 00:39:26,505
Sorry that...

861
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,408
Oh, is that butter?

862
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,889
No no no, don't wipe
it off, I got it.

863
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,250
- It's cream right there.
- Cheese.

864
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:35,199
It's cream cheese! Perfect!
Thank you.

865
00:39:35,547 --> 00:39:36,916
I'm gonna go wash up babe.

866
00:39:39,717 --> 00:39:40,951
Morning.

867
00:39:40,952 --> 00:39:42,958
Good morning.

868
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:50,495
I've got great
Southern exposure, so I

869
00:39:50,496 --> 00:39:52,564
was thinking of
installing a solar array.

870
00:39:52,565 --> 00:39:56,234
And um, maybe a few
rainwater basins too.

871
00:39:56,235 --> 00:39:57,368
That sounds great, Alex.

872
00:39:57,369 --> 00:39:59,770
Then you'd have everything
you need to start a cult.

873
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:01,906
I'm in.

874
00:40:01,907 --> 00:40:04,609
Hey, what do you think the
girls are doing right now?

875
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,743
I don't know, their hair?

876
00:40:06,744 --> 00:40:09,180
What if we propose
an elaborate swap.

877
00:40:09,181 --> 00:40:10,848
Yeah, I think you'd be thrilled.

878
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:12,584
The numbers aren't even.

879
00:40:12,585 --> 00:40:13,584
Ow!

880
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:14,705
The numbers are plenty even.

881
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:16,187
I've done, look...

882
00:40:16,188 --> 00:40:18,756
Alex, you get sweet nubile Kate.

883
00:40:18,757 --> 00:40:19,991
Oh great.

884
00:40:19,992 --> 00:40:21,091
Isaac, you get Sarah.

885
00:40:21,092 --> 00:40:23,012
I get Siri, 'cause, well,
that's all that's left.

886
00:40:23,013 --> 00:40:26,230
And Ben, you get published
in the new yorker.

887
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:27,235
That's hilarious.

888
00:40:33,706 --> 00:40:34,706
The fuck was that?

889
00:40:35,007 --> 00:40:37,510
I don't know, a dog?

890
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,714
Well, the boys better be
close, or they're gonna

891
00:40:42,715 --> 00:40:44,082
get drenched.

892
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:46,683
You want to go on a food run?

893
00:40:46,684 --> 00:40:48,124
I've just been
feeling a little sick.

894
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:50,721
I'll go.

895
00:40:50,722 --> 00:40:51,855
Oh, would you?

896
00:40:51,856 --> 00:40:52,957
<i>Yeah.</i>

897
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:54,725
Great.

898
00:40:54,726 --> 00:40:56,895
Would you, uh, pick
something up for me?

899
00:40:56,896 --> 00:40:58,897
Yes.

900
00:40:58,898 --> 00:40:59,730
- Now?
- Yeah.

901
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:00,964
Let's go.

902
00:41:00,965 --> 00:41:01,899
Cool.

903
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,801
Have fun!

904
00:41:03,802 --> 00:41:05,803
Boy, where'd you come from?

905
00:41:05,804 --> 00:41:08,171
There aren't that
many houses over here.

906
00:41:08,172 --> 00:41:11,142
Hello?

907
00:41:11,143 --> 00:41:13,646
Anyone lose a dog?

908
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:16,281
She looks hungry.

909
00:41:16,282 --> 00:41:17,162
You want some of that?

910
00:41:17,163 --> 00:41:18,363
Whoa, what are you doing, man?

911
00:41:18,364 --> 00:41:19,783
You don't feed a strange dog.

912
00:41:19,784 --> 00:41:20,852
Why not?

913
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:21,819
Cause you'll just confuse
it and make everything

914
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,787
worse.

915
00:41:22,788 --> 00:41:24,187
That's bullshit.

916
00:41:24,188 --> 00:41:26,148
Hey, look, as much as I
want to hang out with this

917
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:29,192
dog all day long, um, has anyone
else noticed it's pouring?

918
00:41:29,193 --> 00:41:30,694
We can't just leave it here.

919
00:41:30,695 --> 00:41:32,135
Owner should've put
some tags on him.

920
00:41:32,136 --> 00:41:33,196
Owner should've what?

921
00:41:33,197 --> 00:41:35,232
Let me see your pen.

922
00:41:35,233 --> 00:41:38,181
Okay, so the dog should be
punished for its owner's sins?

923
00:41:39,304 --> 00:41:41,973
Are you a republican now?

924
00:41:41,974 --> 00:41:43,975
So what if I am?

925
00:41:43,976 --> 00:41:48,346
So what if, what?

926
00:41:48,347 --> 00:41:51,181
Ben, did he tell you about this?

927
00:41:51,182 --> 00:41:52,750
Yum, grape...

928
00:41:52,751 --> 00:41:54,084
Hey, will this work?

929
00:41:54,085 --> 00:41:58,355
Uh, oh God no, that's not good.

930
00:41:58,356 --> 00:42:01,259
So, when did you and Isaac meet?

931
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,292
Freshman year.

932
00:42:02,293 --> 00:42:04,227
He lived down the hall from me.

933
00:42:04,228 --> 00:42:06,663
I was so nervous to
come on this trip.

934
00:42:06,664 --> 00:42:07,531
Really?

935
00:42:07,532 --> 00:42:09,734
Isaac looks up to
you guys so much.

936
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,201
It's like...

937
00:42:11,202 --> 00:42:13,270
Meeting his parents but
worse, because there's

938
00:42:13,271 --> 00:42:14,272
five of you.

939
00:42:14,273 --> 00:42:16,941
Well, be thankful you're
not meeting his parents.

940
00:42:16,942 --> 00:42:23,381
His mom is crazy.

941
00:42:23,382 --> 00:42:26,850
I'm so jealous of you.

942
00:42:26,851 --> 00:42:27,852
Why?

943
00:42:27,853 --> 00:42:30,321
Because, you guys just
have all these shared

944
00:42:30,322 --> 00:42:33,156
experiences that
I'll never have.

945
00:42:33,157 --> 00:42:34,792
Well, you know Isaac.

946
00:42:34,793 --> 00:42:35,993
He was...

947
00:42:35,994 --> 00:42:38,363
Shy and sweet.

948
00:42:38,364 --> 00:42:39,364
Really sweet.

949
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:42,332
He's the only one of us
from the Midwest, so...

950
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:46,236
He's the least neurotic
of the bunch by far.

951
00:42:46,237 --> 00:42:47,872
I can see that.

952
00:42:47,873 --> 00:42:48,872
Yeah.

953
00:42:48,873 --> 00:42:50,793
He takes me out to fancy
dinners all the time and

954
00:42:50,794 --> 00:42:55,834
it's really nice, but
it's not why I like him.

955
00:42:56,382 --> 00:42:58,049
Why do you like him?

956
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:01,051
Because he's grounded.

957
00:43:01,052 --> 00:43:02,252
And he's so kind.

958
00:43:02,253 --> 00:43:04,187
And...

959
00:43:04,188 --> 00:43:05,468
The other day, we celebrated our

960
00:43:05,469 --> 00:43:07,290
quarter-year anniversary.

961
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:08,344
Which is ridiculous.

962
00:43:09,027 --> 00:43:10,062
It's so ridiculous.

963
00:43:10,063 --> 00:43:14,799
But it made me really
happy, and I think he's

964
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,038
got the right priorities,
which is rare.

965
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:21,238
Everything okay.

966
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:22,707
Yeah.

967
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:25,109
Ugh! So many mushrooms.

968
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,377
Ooh, watermelon.

969
00:43:26,378 --> 00:43:28,018
There you are.

970
00:43:33,018 --> 00:43:34,819
Hey, big news.

971
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,787
What?

972
00:43:35,788 --> 00:43:37,355
Isaac voted for bush.

973
00:43:37,356 --> 00:43:39,122
That's not the news.

974
00:43:39,123 --> 00:43:41,359
We found a dog.

975
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,127
Oh my God.

976
00:43:44,128 --> 00:43:45,830
Where did you guys find it?

977
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,964
At the river in the woods.

978
00:43:47,965 --> 00:43:49,701
I'm going to go take a shower.

979
00:43:49,702 --> 00:43:52,022
Alex, hold on, would you give
me one second, I can come in.

980
00:43:52,023 --> 00:43:53,037
What, what, what, what?

981
00:43:53,038 --> 00:43:55,138
You're gonna come with
me and, and bathe me?

982
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:56,499
That's not what I
was going to say.

983
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,944
Okay, I'm fucking fine, okay?

984
00:43:59,945 --> 00:44:00,945
Okay?

985
00:44:01,012 --> 00:44:02,012
Everybody, I...

986
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,348
Thank you for your
concern, but I am fucking

987
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:07,819
fine, and just please,
stop following me around,

988
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,456
okay?

989
00:44:11,456 --> 00:44:16,093
What do we do?

990
00:44:16,094 --> 00:44:18,162
He said he's fucking fine.

991
00:44:18,163 --> 00:44:19,643
I'm going to check
on him in a minute.

992
00:44:19,644 --> 00:44:22,033
You know, I think he is, okay?

993
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,768
How do you know?

994
00:44:24,769 --> 00:44:26,474
I just know.

995
00:44:28,474 --> 00:44:29,806
Hey.

996
00:44:29,807 --> 00:44:30,475
Ha!

997
00:44:30,476 --> 00:44:32,276
Sweet nectar and ambrosia.

998
00:44:32,277 --> 00:44:33,778
There's more in the car.

999
00:44:33,779 --> 00:44:35,315
Oh my gosh!

1000
00:44:36,315 --> 00:44:37,982
Who is this!

1001
00:44:37,983 --> 00:44:38,850
You know Josh.

1002
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:41,887
He makes friends
everywhere he goes.

1003
00:44:42,887 --> 00:44:44,788
I missed you.

1004
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:48,994
I missed you too.

1005
00:44:57,369 --> 00:44:58,468
Jeff Goldblum.

1006
00:44:58,469 --> 00:44:59,270
Done.

1007
00:44:59,271 --> 00:45:00,238
Jeff Goldblum!

1008
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,839
Yeah.

1009
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,274
The dog was in the fly?

1010
00:45:03,275 --> 00:45:04,241
I think it's good.

1011
00:45:04,242 --> 00:45:05,776
You don't name
a dog "Jeff."

1012
00:45:05,777 --> 00:45:07,178
Why would it be
named Jeff Goldblum?

1013
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:09,499
It wouldn't be named Jeff,
it would be named Jeff Goldblum.

1014
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,380
How do you know the dog
is Jewish, first of all?

1015
00:45:11,381 --> 00:45:11,716
How did you just assume?

1016
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:12,996
How did you make that call?

1017
00:45:12,997 --> 00:45:15,185
That's the dog's name. You're
welcome.

1018
00:45:15,186 --> 00:45:16,453
Jeff Goldblum.

1019
00:45:16,454 --> 00:45:19,156
Then name the dog, please.

1020
00:45:19,157 --> 00:45:21,091
I think he likes the name Timmy.

1021
00:45:21,092 --> 00:45:22,192
Timmy, you're good, huh?

1022
00:45:22,193 --> 00:45:23,393
Timmy's a good name.

1023
00:45:23,394 --> 00:45:25,830
Come here, come here, come here.

1024
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:27,500
Shh, shh.

1025
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,335
Wait, hold on guys, seriously.

1026
00:45:31,436 --> 00:45:33,437
I think I can hear
Timmy's thoughts.

1027
00:45:33,438 --> 00:45:37,441
Gee, I sure am glad I'm inside
right now.

1028
00:45:37,442 --> 00:45:39,916
Instead of being out there
in the cold and rain.

1029
00:45:40,116 --> 00:45:42,272
The mean man with the
effeminate shoes didn't

1030
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:43,046
want me to come.

1031
00:45:43,047 --> 00:45:44,582
Hey!

1032
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:46,350
Timmy would kill
for these shoes.

1033
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:49,252
But I'll bite his ass later.

1034
00:45:49,253 --> 00:45:52,156
Why do we just assume
that dogs talk like that?

1035
00:45:52,157 --> 00:45:54,077
I mean, it's not like a
dog just opened his mouth

1036
00:45:54,078 --> 00:45:55,926
one day and that's what
it sounded like and we

1037
00:45:55,927 --> 00:45:57,565
assigned that voice to it.

1038
00:46:00,565 --> 00:46:02,066
Ignore them, Timmy.

1039
00:46:02,067 --> 00:46:02,734
Timmy?

1040
00:46:02,934 --> 00:46:03,934
That's his name.

1041
00:46:05,286 --> 00:46:06,971
Hey, I just thought
of something.

1042
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:07,971
What?

1043
00:46:07,972 --> 00:46:09,874
Um, I told Siri earlier
how much I loved your

1044
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:12,243
place, and all you guys
were missing was a dog,

1045
00:46:12,244 --> 00:46:14,078
and now...

1046
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,446
One appears!

1047
00:46:15,447 --> 00:46:17,416
You have your chance.

1048
00:46:18,416 --> 00:46:20,317
We're not getting a dog.

1049
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:21,285
Siri, it's not a dog.

1050
00:46:21,286 --> 00:46:22,285
It's Timmy.

1051
00:46:22,286 --> 00:46:23,821
<i>Yeah.</i>

1052
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:27,325
I'm not just a dog, I need a
house, and I like you

1053
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,160
guys the best.

1054
00:46:30,161 --> 00:46:31,561
<i>You guys have that
little backyard.</i>

1055
00:46:31,562 --> 00:46:32,897
It can run back and forth...

1056
00:46:32,898 --> 00:46:33,864
Yeah.

1057
00:46:33,865 --> 00:46:36,533
Timmy, where do you want to go?

1058
00:46:36,534 --> 00:46:39,337
He says, he says
he wants it too.

1059
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,173
That's too bad.

1060
00:46:42,173 --> 00:46:44,575
So, uh, what are
we making Sarah?

1061
00:46:44,576 --> 00:46:50,080
We are making chilled
watermelon soup and sea scallop

1062
00:46:50,081 --> 00:46:51,047
Risotto.

1063
00:46:51,048 --> 00:46:51,548
<i>What?</i>

1064
00:46:51,717 --> 00:46:52,757
<i>What are we making again?</i>

1065
00:46:52,758 --> 00:46:54,358
<i>I'm sorry, can you
do something helpful?</i>

1066
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:55,285
Did you say Risotto?

1067
00:46:55,286 --> 00:46:57,455
Can you please do
something helpful?

1068
00:46:57,456 --> 00:46:59,624
The joint's not going
to roll itself, Sarah.

1069
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:01,926
And I'm making a magical
appetizer dish that's

1070
00:47:01,927 --> 00:47:04,962
going to make your
Risotto so much better.

1071
00:47:04,963 --> 00:47:06,163
Alright, please?

1072
00:47:06,164 --> 00:47:07,231
Please what?

1073
00:47:10,068 --> 00:47:11,334
Uh oh.

1074
00:47:11,335 --> 00:47:14,071
What?

1075
00:47:14,072 --> 00:47:16,172
Give me a break, I'm
not listening to that.

1076
00:47:16,173 --> 00:47:17,642
What?

1077
00:47:17,643 --> 00:47:20,111
It's like we're gripped by
this never-ending nostalgia

1078
00:47:20,112 --> 00:47:22,613
for our parents' music.

1079
00:47:22,614 --> 00:47:24,915
It's oppressive.

1080
00:47:24,916 --> 00:47:26,951
What about Bruce
Springsteen is oppressive?

1081
00:47:26,952 --> 00:47:28,912
Let me tell you something
about Bruce Springsteen,

1082
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:29,153
okay?

1083
00:47:29,154 --> 00:47:31,421
Never, never trust anyone
who is that passionate

1084
00:47:31,422 --> 00:47:33,624
about the state of New Jersey.

1085
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:35,459
<i>You are so full of shit.</i>

1086
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,095
<i>Okay.</i>

1087
00:47:38,096 --> 00:47:38,596
Hmm?

1088
00:47:38,663 --> 00:47:39,623
What is he gonna do now.

1089
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:41,966
What've we got.

1090
00:47:41,967 --> 00:47:43,134
Arcade fire?

1091
00:47:43,135 --> 00:47:44,368
Yes. Arcade fucking fire.

1092
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:44,869
What?

1093
00:47:44,936 --> 00:47:46,236
What's wrong with this.

1094
00:47:46,237 --> 00:47:48,038
Too Canadian.

1095
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:50,073
What does that mean?

1096
00:47:50,074 --> 00:47:52,310
Too Canadian, really?

1097
00:47:52,311 --> 00:47:53,643
Does, does this
look too Canadian?

1098
00:47:53,644 --> 00:47:54,611
Really?

1099
00:47:54,612 --> 00:47:55,546
But who knows.

1100
00:47:55,547 --> 00:47:56,480
I don't know.

1101
00:47:56,481 --> 00:47:58,381
Maybe it fits our
postmodern profile for a

1102
00:47:58,382 --> 00:48:01,185
Canadian band to best
express American anxiety

1103
00:48:01,186 --> 00:48:04,254
during this gradual
post-empire period of decline.

1104
00:48:04,255 --> 00:48:06,991
Blah, blah, blah,
bullshit, blah.

1105
00:48:06,992 --> 00:48:08,725
Miss Kate?

1106
00:48:08,726 --> 00:48:11,529
Oh I don't,
I don't normally smoke.

1107
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:15,499
Honey, it's not going to bite.

1108
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,667
Okay.

1109
00:48:16,668 --> 00:48:18,736
Fine.

1110
00:48:18,737 --> 00:48:21,574
<i>I like Kate.</i>

1111
00:48:23,574 --> 00:48:25,347
There you go.

1112
00:48:28,347 --> 00:48:29,347
<i>Alright.</i>

1113
00:48:35,253 --> 00:48:37,321
<i>Alex, where did you
get these records?</i>

1114
00:48:37,322 --> 00:48:39,290
<i>I feel like I'm
at a garage sale.</i>

1115
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,297
I, I bought them at a garage
sale.

1116
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,397
Babe?

1117
00:48:47,398 --> 00:48:49,469
I'm okay.

1118
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,602
What's going on?

1119
00:48:52,603 --> 00:48:54,504
Come on...

1120
00:48:54,505 --> 00:48:56,640
Look, if now is not the
time to get fucked up, I

1121
00:48:56,641 --> 00:49:00,477
really, I don't.. I
don't know when is.

1122
00:49:00,478 --> 00:49:01,678
<i>Fuck it.</i>

1123
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:02,680
I'm dancing.

1124
00:49:02,681 --> 00:49:04,714
I'm gonna dance too.

1125
00:49:04,715 --> 00:49:06,082
Oh, here we go.

1126
00:49:06,083 --> 00:49:11,055
You should prepare
yourself for this.

1127
00:49:11,056 --> 00:49:12,741
This is what you
call a home run.

1128
00:49:13,025 --> 00:49:14,499
- Turn it up!
- That's right.

1129
00:49:18,195 --> 00:49:21,464
See that? Isaac,
who's the dancer now?

1130
00:49:21,465 --> 00:49:24,334
That's right Kate, Isaac
don't know these moves.

1131
00:49:24,335 --> 00:49:25,914
He won't show you these moves.

1132
00:49:41,485 --> 00:49:42,319
Hello.

1133
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,187
What is up?

1134
00:49:44,188 --> 00:49:45,790
This looks terrible.

1135
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:48,325
Thanks.

1136
00:49:48,326 --> 00:49:54,431
How serious were
you this morning?

1137
00:49:54,432 --> 00:49:56,366
About what?

1138
00:49:56,367 --> 00:49:59,569
You know what.

1139
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:03,707
I just thought...

1140
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:05,810
No, you know what, I'm
sorry I said anything.

1141
00:50:05,811 --> 00:50:08,379
I shouldn't have said anything.

1142
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,550
I'm not sorry.

1143
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:13,550
I'm not sorry.

1144
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:21,524
- Okay, then...
- Isaac!

1145
00:50:21,525 --> 00:50:22,326
Yeah.

1146
00:50:22,327 --> 00:50:23,861
Get your anti-government
ass in here.

1147
00:50:23,862 --> 00:50:25,666
Come on.

1148
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:34,639
I gotta go show those
fools how to dance.

1149
00:50:49,554 --> 00:50:54,258
♪ Don't know
what you want. ♪

1150
00:50:54,259 --> 00:51:02,300
♪ So if you come round here, don't
make it clear, I want to be your man ♪

1151
00:51:08,572 --> 00:51:10,643
What?

1152
00:51:12,643 --> 00:51:14,444
What's up?

1153
00:51:14,445 --> 00:51:15,745
Nothing.

1154
00:51:15,746 --> 00:51:17,848
Nothing?

1155
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:19,751
Since when do you
turn down a joint?

1156
00:51:20,751 --> 00:51:24,297
I'm just not in the mood.

1157
00:51:33,019 --> 00:51:34,230
Then tell me something.

1158
00:51:34,231 --> 00:51:36,466
I'm dying over here.

1159
00:51:36,467 --> 00:51:39,403
I didn't want to influence you.

1160
00:51:39,404 --> 00:51:41,305
On what?

1161
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,841
It should just be about us.

1162
00:51:43,842 --> 00:51:45,844
Really.

1163
00:51:46,844 --> 00:51:51,549
Oh... are you,
are you s...

1164
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:54,519
Are you saying...

1165
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,486
I don't know.

1166
00:51:56,487 --> 00:51:57,555
Are you sure?

1167
00:51:57,556 --> 00:51:59,689
No, I'm not sure.

1168
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,292
Just...

1169
00:52:01,293 --> 00:52:02,826
Feeling.

1170
00:52:02,827 --> 00:52:05,931
I got a test today, but...

1171
00:52:06,931 --> 00:52:10,335
What does that look mean?

1172
00:52:11,302 --> 00:52:14,238
I'm, um...

1173
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:17,808
I'm imagining a baby that
looks half like you and

1174
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:21,645
half like me.

1175
00:52:21,646 --> 00:52:22,645
That tends to happen.

1176
00:52:22,646 --> 00:52:27,454
No.

1177
00:52:30,454 --> 00:52:32,689
What if I moved to LA?

1178
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,625
I mean, sure when I got
there I'd be unemployed

1179
00:52:34,626 --> 00:52:37,928
and probably have to bus
tables or whatever those

1180
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:40,863
people in LA do until they...

1181
00:52:40,864 --> 00:52:42,366
Make better money, but...

1182
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,268
And please don't say that
if you don't mean it.

1183
00:52:45,269 --> 00:52:48,738
Of course I mean it.

1184
00:52:48,739 --> 00:52:52,509
All I'm saying is let's try.

1185
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:54,778
You want to try with me?

1186
00:52:54,779 --> 00:52:55,712
Yeah.

1187
00:52:55,713 --> 00:52:57,948
Yeah?

1188
00:52:57,949 --> 00:53:00,291
Yeah!

1189
00:53:14,833 --> 00:53:24,833

you so certain I'm yours to take. ♪

1190
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:35,744

1192
00:53:38,856 --> 00:53:40,925
Food's ready, you guys.

1193
00:53:41,925 --> 00:53:42,826
You guys!

1194
00:53:42,827 --> 00:53:44,996
Thank you.

1195
00:53:45,996 --> 00:53:48,369
Wow.

1196
00:53:52,369 --> 00:53:55,413
Mm.

1197
00:54:01,413 --> 00:54:04,814
This food is so
incredible, Sarah.

1198
00:54:04,815 --> 00:54:05,817
Oh God.

1199
00:54:08,585 --> 00:54:10,386
You guys, you're welcome.

1200
00:54:10,387 --> 00:54:11,787
You are incredibly
stoned right now.

1201
00:54:11,788 --> 00:54:13,188
I would just like
to point that out.

1202
00:54:13,189 --> 00:54:15,759
Sarah, we are barely high.

1203
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,328
Come on.

1204
00:54:17,329 --> 00:54:21,364
Okay, some of us
might be a little high.

1205
00:54:21,365 --> 00:54:22,066
Oh, sweetie.

1206
00:54:22,067 --> 00:54:24,067
Oh, I'm sorry.

1207
00:54:24,068 --> 00:54:27,104
I just really like how
cold it feels on my tongue.

1208
00:54:27,105 --> 00:54:28,238
Okay.

1209
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:29,406
How come you haven't opened
up your own restaurant yet?

1210
00:54:29,407 --> 00:54:30,540
What's the deal?

1211
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:33,643
Mm, it's called
law school loans.

1212
00:54:33,644 --> 00:54:35,979
How come we didn't do
more drugs in college?

1213
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,046
That's a good question.

1214
00:54:37,047 --> 00:54:39,582
I figured that I would be
far less curious now if I

1215
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:43,554
had just done a better job of
doing more drugs in college.

1216
00:54:45,056 --> 00:54:47,296
Well, you know we had a
good run freshman year.

1217
00:54:47,297 --> 00:54:49,359
Mhmm.

1218
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,761
You remember that time
Siri ate that weed brownie

1219
00:54:51,762 --> 00:54:53,830
and ran through someone's
yard buck-naked?

1220
00:54:53,831 --> 00:54:54,997
Stop it!

1221
00:54:54,998 --> 00:54:56,633
Oh touchy!

1222
00:54:56,634 --> 00:54:57,634
It's true! You did!

1223
00:54:57,635 --> 00:54:58,801
Stop it!

1224
00:54:58,802 --> 00:55:00,971
What happened to us?

1225
00:55:00,972 --> 00:55:02,406
We got serious.

1226
00:55:02,407 --> 00:55:03,287
And we got girlfriend.

1227
00:55:03,288 --> 00:55:04,875
Oh, hey, okay.

1228
00:55:04,876 --> 00:55:07,377
You know what this is like?

1229
00:55:07,378 --> 00:55:09,645
This is like one of
those '80s movies.

1230
00:55:09,646 --> 00:55:10,647
<i>What?</i>

1231
00:55:10,648 --> 00:55:11,814
Like one of those movies
where there's like a big

1232
00:55:11,815 --> 00:55:13,116
group of people...

1233
00:55:13,117 --> 00:55:14,951
I just don't see why
everything in our lives

1234
00:55:14,952 --> 00:55:17,453
has to be like something else.

1235
00:55:17,454 --> 00:55:18,721
That's real deep Siri.

1236
00:55:18,722 --> 00:55:19,723
I'm serious.

1237
00:55:19,724 --> 00:55:21,604
It's like we can't just
experience something and

1238
00:55:21,605 --> 00:55:22,091
let it be.

1239
00:55:22,092 --> 00:55:24,595
'Cause that's the way
the people relate today.

1240
00:55:24,596 --> 00:55:26,276
They don't, they don't
talk about anything.

1241
00:55:26,277 --> 00:55:27,397
They just reference things.

1242
00:55:27,398 --> 00:55:28,564
Thank, thank you.

1243
00:55:28,565 --> 00:55:29,866
Oh yeah, I had a great weekend.

1244
00:55:29,867 --> 00:55:30,834
I went to this wedding.

1245
00:55:30,835 --> 00:55:32,595
You know actually, it
was a lot like "wedding

1246
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:34,872
crashers," but
meets "memento."

1247
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,672
That sounds like a good weekend

1248
00:55:36,673 --> 00:55:38,433
yeah, it probably does sound
cool. Who knows?

1249
00:55:38,434 --> 00:55:39,868
Or like, I don't know
how I was feeling, it was

1250
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:42,111
probably, probably how
Rachel felt when Ross was

1251
00:55:42,112 --> 00:55:43,814
marrying that British girl.

1252
00:55:43,815 --> 00:55:44,948
Well, time out.

1253
00:55:44,949 --> 00:55:47,149
I'm pretty sure you just
admitted to watching "friends."

1254
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:48,886
Yes. You did. He did.

1255
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,622
There are Libyan refugees
who've seen "friends."

1256
00:55:51,623 --> 00:55:54,958
Oh, I have never felt this
stoned in my whole life.

1257
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:57,528
Wow, okay.

1258
00:55:57,529 --> 00:56:00,863
It's hot. It's hot. It's hot.

1259
00:56:00,864 --> 00:56:02,466
It's hot in here.

1260
00:56:02,467 --> 00:56:03,866
It's pot.

1261
00:56:03,867 --> 00:56:05,067
It's pot?

1262
00:56:05,068 --> 00:56:06,703
Oh, that's a funny joke.

1263
00:56:06,704 --> 00:56:08,906
Well,

1264
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:09,672
whoa!

1265
00:56:09,673 --> 00:56:10,908
Whoa, okay.

1266
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,749
Okay, that's a fun game
we're not going to play

1267
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:13,544
right now.

1268
00:56:13,545 --> 00:56:14,912
Is this a joke?

1269
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,213
Are you my dad?

1270
00:56:21,885 --> 00:56:23,053
Oh, that's me, sorry.

1271
00:56:23,054 --> 00:56:24,694
Are you sure you want
to answer right now?

1272
00:56:24,695 --> 00:56:26,723
<i>Maybe don't answer right now.</i>

1273
00:56:26,724 --> 00:56:27,890
And she answers it.

1274
00:56:27,891 --> 00:56:29,993
Uh huh?

1275
00:56:29,994 --> 00:56:31,928
Tonight?

1276
00:56:31,929 --> 00:56:33,230
Yeah, it's okay if..

1277
00:56:33,231 --> 00:56:34,198
Could be important.

1278
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:35,799
No, of course I'm okay.

1279
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,233
Okay.

1280
00:56:36,234 --> 00:56:37,201
Okay.

1281
00:56:37,202 --> 00:56:40,005
Bye.

1282
00:56:42,005 --> 00:56:43,239
Oh my God.

1283
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,107
<i>Hmm?</i>

1284
00:56:44,108 --> 00:56:46,944
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

1285
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,979
Oh my God oh my God oh my God
oh my God oh my God oh my God.

1286
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:49,447
What is it?

1287
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:50,113
Are you alright?

1288
00:56:50,114 --> 00:56:51,247
I'm so screwed.

1289
00:56:51,248 --> 00:56:53,408
They just asked me to cover
the crisis hotline tonight.

1290
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:54,084
Now?

1291
00:56:54,085 --> 00:56:55,051
Yeah.

1292
00:56:55,052 --> 00:56:56,118
Wow.

1293
00:56:56,119 --> 00:56:57,119
Can you say no?

1294
00:56:58,021 --> 00:56:59,189
I can't breathe.

1295
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:01,124
No, I think you're
going to do a great job.

1296
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:03,526
<i>I agree, she is going
to knock 'em dead.</i>

1297
00:57:03,527 --> 00:57:04,407
<i>Hey! That's not funny.</i>

1298
00:57:04,408 --> 00:57:05,495
I can't breathe.

1299
00:57:05,496 --> 00:57:06,796
That's a little funny.

1300
00:57:06,797 --> 00:57:07,330
No it's going to be okay.

1301
00:57:07,331 --> 00:57:08,211
It's going to be fine.

1302
00:57:08,212 --> 00:57:09,765
No, it's not okay.

1303
00:57:09,766 --> 00:57:15,605
No it's not okay, it's
not okay, it's not okay!

1304
00:57:15,606 --> 00:57:16,973
Okay, hang on for a bit.

1305
00:57:16,974 --> 00:57:18,642
Isaac, this is a big deal.

1306
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:19,676
People are going to die.

1307
00:57:19,677 --> 00:57:21,143
They're not going to die.

1308
00:57:21,144 --> 00:57:22,745
Hey, hey, Kate?

1309
00:57:22,746 --> 00:57:24,714
So, I have some
Xanax in my purse.

1310
00:57:24,715 --> 00:57:25,883
I'm going to go get it, okay?

1311
00:57:25,884 --> 00:57:26,917
I have Klonopin right here.

1312
00:57:26,918 --> 00:57:27,651
I've got one in my pocket.

1313
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:28,932
Yeah, but Xanax kicks in faster.

1314
00:57:28,933 --> 00:57:29,986
Klonopin lasts longer.

1315
00:57:29,987 --> 00:57:31,888
Which one do you prefer, Timmy?

1316
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:33,122
Timmy likes Klonopin.

1317
00:57:33,123 --> 00:57:34,691
Well Xanax gives me a headache!

1318
00:57:34,692 --> 00:57:35,826
It's going to be fine.

1319
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,147
It's... you're going to be
talking

1320
00:57:37,148 --> 00:57:38,388
just like you're talking to me.

1321
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:39,896
<i>But Klonopin has a little more
bite!</i>

1322
00:57:39,897 --> 00:57:43,933
Okay, so there you go,
and now you have the best

1323
00:57:43,934 --> 00:57:46,837
anti-anxiety medicine
money can buy.

1324
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,971
That's debatable.

1325
00:57:48,972 --> 00:57:49,692
Not helping. Stop.

1326
00:57:49,693 --> 00:57:51,607
There we go. Let's get Upsies.

1327
00:57:51,608 --> 00:57:52,308
Ohoho.

1328
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:53,243
<i>Ohh, alright!</i>

1329
00:57:53,244 --> 00:57:54,678
Hey!

1330
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:55,712
<i>She's up!</i>

1331
00:57:55,713 --> 00:57:56,980
Okay.

1332
00:57:56,981 --> 00:57:58,281
Josh.

1333
00:57:58,282 --> 00:57:58,783
What?

1334
00:57:58,983 --> 00:58:00,616
When did you start taking meds?

1335
00:58:00,617 --> 00:58:01,551
What?

1336
00:58:01,552 --> 00:58:02,553
Prescription drugs.

1337
00:58:02,554 --> 00:58:03,886
When did you start taking them?

1338
00:58:03,887 --> 00:58:04,955
The Klonopin thing?

1339
00:58:04,956 --> 00:58:05,656
Yeah.

1340
00:58:05,657 --> 00:58:06,857
I don't want to talk about it.

1341
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:07,924
Why?

1342
00:58:07,925 --> 00:58:10,127
Because I don't want
to talk about it.

1343
00:58:10,128 --> 00:58:12,729
I'm just curious.

1344
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:14,131
I'm not judging.

1345
00:58:14,132 --> 00:58:16,299
I went to a therapist
once, and I don't go

1346
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,234
anymore.

1347
00:58:17,235 --> 00:58:18,569
And they gave me that.

1348
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:19,537
Just once?

1349
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:21,378
I started going when I
realized I was writing a

1350
00:58:21,379 --> 00:58:23,839
dissertation that probably
no one in their right mind

1351
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,981
is ever going to read.

1352
00:58:29,981 --> 00:58:31,214
Let's play a game.

1353
00:58:31,215 --> 00:58:31,816
<i>Yeah.</i>

1354
00:58:32,016 --> 00:58:33,783
<i>Yeah!</i>

1355
00:58:33,784 --> 00:58:38,254
Alright, I actually have a game.

1356
00:58:38,255 --> 00:58:39,957
Ready? Get out of there.

1357
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:41,725
<i>What are the rules, then?</i>

1358
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,627
Okay.

1359
00:58:43,628 --> 00:58:44,595
Good question.

1360
00:58:44,596 --> 00:58:47,930
The rules are that there
are no rules until you

1361
00:58:47,931 --> 00:58:50,335
write them on a card.

1362
00:58:51,335 --> 00:58:53,035
Okay, are we in?

1363
00:58:53,036 --> 00:58:53,956
<i>Yeah, let's do it</i> okay.

1364
00:58:53,957 --> 00:58:55,997
I'll go first.

1365
00:59:00,878 --> 00:59:01,877
Okay.

1366
00:59:01,878 --> 00:59:03,779
Everyone one must pat
their heads and rub their

1367
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:06,383
bellies before playing a
card, or they have to take

1368
00:59:06,384 --> 00:59:07,384
a drink.

1369
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:08,790
What are we doing?

1370
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,788
Playing an imbecilic game.

1371
00:59:11,789 --> 00:59:12,888
Sounds good, I'm in.

1372
00:59:12,889 --> 00:59:14,059
Woo hoo!

1373
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:16,093
Okay.

1374
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:19,062
Okay, that's great, but
you have to rub your belly

1375
00:59:19,063 --> 00:59:20,303
and pat your head before you...

1376
00:59:20,304 --> 00:59:22,131
Can we stop saying belly?
It's...

1377
00:59:22,132 --> 00:59:23,200
Belly. Rub it.

1378
00:59:23,201 --> 00:59:26,370
Before you speak, you must
turn to the person on your

1379
00:59:26,371 --> 00:59:28,738
left, introduce
yourself, then hug.

1380
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:30,640
Are you fucking kidding me?

1381
00:59:30,641 --> 00:59:31,375
Come on big guy.

1382
00:59:31,376 --> 00:59:32,310
Let's do this.

1383
00:59:32,311 --> 00:59:34,243
Absolute... get the fuck,
get away from me.

1384
00:59:34,244 --> 00:59:35,444
You didn't introduce yourself.

1385
00:59:35,445 --> 00:59:36,365
You just read the card.

1386
00:59:36,366 --> 00:59:38,180
You didn't introduce yourself.

1387
00:59:38,181 --> 00:59:39,621
You didn't introduce
yourself either.

1388
00:59:39,622 --> 00:59:40,622
That's fair, okay.

1389
00:59:41,018 --> 00:59:42,785
Hello, my name is Sarah.

1390
00:59:42,786 --> 00:59:44,687
It's really nice to meet
you, and now we are...

1391
00:59:44,688 --> 00:59:45,721
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

1392
00:59:45,722 --> 00:59:46,922
Hi, I'm Josh.

1393
00:59:46,923 --> 00:59:50,228
This game is slowly
making me stupider.

1394
00:59:51,228 --> 00:59:52,995
Okay, I'll do it.

1395
00:59:52,996 --> 00:59:53,431
No, I got you.

1396
00:59:53,432 --> 00:59:57,268
Hold on.

1397
00:59:57,868 --> 00:59:58,068
Okay, first off, I have to..

1398
00:59:58,268 --> 00:59:59,268
Yeah.

1399
01:00:00,635 --> 01:00:01,478
Hi, how are you.

1400
01:00:01,479 --> 01:00:08,278
Hello.

1401
01:00:08,279 --> 01:00:09,413
Really?

1402
01:00:09,414 --> 01:00:10,534
Yeah. It's part of the game.

1403
01:00:10,535 --> 01:00:14,010
Why don't you read it?

1404
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:22,725
Um, suicide.

1405
01:00:22,726 --> 01:00:26,462
Everyone take a turn and
explain what it means to you.

1406
01:00:26,463 --> 01:00:27,397
Good job, man.

1407
01:00:27,398 --> 01:00:29,876
Thank you.

1408
01:00:38,876 --> 01:00:42,412
Uh, this card makes all of
Josh's rules invalid and

1409
01:00:42,413 --> 01:00:43,846
can be played at any time.

1410
01:00:43,847 --> 01:00:44,848
You can't do that.

1411
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:45,849
Just did.

1412
01:00:46,016 --> 01:00:47,049
Sorry, the card says you
can play the card at any time.

1413
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:49,151
It goes against the
underlying architecture of

1414
01:00:49,152 --> 01:00:51,955
the game of laying
cards and taking turns.

1415
01:00:51,956 --> 01:00:54,390
For being all strict about it,
you didn't introduce yourself.

1416
01:00:54,391 --> 01:00:56,426
Neither the fuck did you!

1417
01:00:56,427 --> 01:00:57,326
Okay, Josh.

1418
01:00:57,327 --> 01:00:58,962
Let's, uh, let's do that.

1419
01:00:58,963 --> 01:01:00,464
But you, you start.

1420
01:01:00,465 --> 01:01:01,297
Let's not.

1421
01:01:01,298 --> 01:01:04,267
No no, let's do it.

1422
01:01:04,268 --> 01:01:06,403
Okay.

1423
01:01:06,404 --> 01:01:07,770
Yeah.

1424
01:01:07,771 --> 01:01:10,439
I get sadness, okay?

1425
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,375
I certainly get anxiety.

1426
01:01:12,376 --> 01:01:13,475
I get depression.

1427
01:01:13,476 --> 01:01:16,078
I'm pretty sure that I'm
experiencing one of those

1428
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,482
things at all times, but
what I don't understand

1429
01:01:19,483 --> 01:01:21,785
is, Alex, is suicide,
because never once have I

1430
01:01:21,786 --> 01:01:25,154
not been absolutely
terrified of my own death,

1431
01:01:25,155 --> 01:01:27,991
and what that might do
to everyone around me.

1432
01:01:27,992 --> 01:01:28,825
<i>I'm done.</i>

1433
01:01:28,826 --> 01:01:30,346
I don't want to play
this game anymore.

1434
01:01:30,347 --> 01:01:31,895
No, I think this is
a really good game.

1435
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:34,064
We've been dancing around
the main point of this

1436
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,500
trip all weekend.

1437
01:01:36,501 --> 01:01:38,935
I mean Jesus Christ.

1438
01:01:38,936 --> 01:01:41,303
Nobody would even talk
about the downstairs

1439
01:01:41,304 --> 01:01:43,073
bathroom, let alone walk
in there.

1440
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:44,274
Alex, I've been in there.

1441
01:01:44,275 --> 01:01:45,776
It's a fucking mess.

1442
01:01:45,777 --> 01:01:47,243
So let's open that door.

1443
01:01:47,244 --> 01:01:49,779
Literally, metaphorically,
pardon the pun.

1444
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:50,946
Josh, stop.

1445
01:01:50,947 --> 01:01:53,250
Sarah, please shut up.

1446
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:55,317
I think Alex should,
should give it to us

1447
01:01:55,318 --> 01:01:56,520
straight here.

1448
01:01:56,521 --> 01:01:57,620
You know?

1449
01:01:57,621 --> 01:02:00,457
Tell us all what a good
job we all did of fucking

1450
01:02:00,458 --> 01:02:02,192
him up when he was down.

1451
01:02:02,193 --> 01:02:04,861
How we all noticed his
increasingly erratic

1452
01:02:04,862 --> 01:02:07,830
tweets and status updates,
and how we all thought

1453
01:02:07,831 --> 01:02:09,516
enough to do something about it.

1454
01:02:10,001 --> 01:02:10,501
Alright.

1455
01:02:10,568 --> 01:02:11,535
Sarah...

1456
01:02:11,536 --> 01:02:13,502
Let her go, she'll be fine.

1457
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,138
You're a piece of
shit, you know that?

1458
01:02:15,139 --> 01:02:16,573
I'm a truth teller.

1459
01:02:16,574 --> 01:02:19,542
Alex has been saying some,
no offense, you've been

1460
01:02:19,543 --> 01:02:21,210
saying some weird
stuff for a while.

1461
01:02:21,211 --> 01:02:24,915
And you can't
blame us for not...

1462
01:02:24,916 --> 01:02:26,876
Being able to see that
there was a bigger problem.

1463
01:02:26,877 --> 01:02:28,218
Some weird stuff?

1464
01:02:28,219 --> 01:02:30,085
I'm sorry, what was it
exactly Alex, that it...

1465
01:02:30,086 --> 01:02:31,287
Does anybody remember?

1466
01:02:31,288 --> 01:02:35,892
"Ask for me tomorrow and
you shall find me a grave man?"

1467
01:02:35,893 --> 01:02:38,160
Lot of ambiguity in that one.

1468
01:02:38,161 --> 01:02:39,261
Where the fuck were you?

1469
01:02:39,262 --> 01:02:39,902
That's my point?

1470
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:41,497
Where the fuck were any of us?

1471
01:02:41,498 --> 01:02:47,206
Okay, okay, um...

1472
01:02:48,206 --> 01:02:50,573
Alex called me a lot that day.

1473
01:02:50,574 --> 01:02:55,444
He called me a lot
that week, and uh...

1474
01:02:55,445 --> 01:02:58,314
And I didn't answer.

1475
01:02:58,315 --> 01:03:05,589
I didn't answer even though I
knew he wasn't doing well.

1476
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:10,526
The truth is, none of this
would've happened if I

1477
01:03:10,527 --> 01:03:15,098
would've been a better
friend to my friend.

1478
01:03:15,099 --> 01:03:16,031
No...

1479
01:03:16,032 --> 01:03:18,033
So, this one's on me.

1480
01:03:18,034 --> 01:03:19,350
No it's not, Ben, please.

1481
01:03:20,003 --> 01:03:24,140
No. It's not, I mean, I...

1482
01:03:24,141 --> 01:03:27,944
Yeah, I, I was upset that
you were not answering my

1483
01:03:27,945 --> 01:03:32,915
calls, but I...

1484
01:03:32,916 --> 01:03:38,555
I didn't want to die.

1485
01:03:38,556 --> 01:03:41,457
What?

1486
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:44,261
Well, I, know, I mean, I...

1487
01:03:44,262 --> 01:03:47,363
I thought I, I
thought I did. I did. I...

1488
01:03:47,364 --> 01:03:49,299
If you didn't want
to die then, w...

1489
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,268
I did, but then I, I
changed my mind, and I

1490
01:03:52,269 --> 01:03:56,071
called the hospital
myself, and... you know,

1491
01:03:56,072 --> 01:03:59,341
I, I think...

1492
01:03:59,342 --> 01:04:04,016
I, I really think that I
just wanted to, you know,

1493
01:04:05,016 --> 01:04:07,619
to see you, and...

1494
01:04:09,619 --> 01:04:11,288
You wanted to see me?

1495
01:04:11,289 --> 01:04:13,555
Well yeah, I mean, no,
but, you, and everyone.

1496
01:04:13,556 --> 01:04:14,524
Right right, everyone.

1497
01:04:14,525 --> 01:04:15,524
Right.

1498
01:04:15,525 --> 01:04:17,259
You wanted to see
everyone, so you slit your

1499
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:20,663
wrists, but not enough so
you would die, but..

1500
01:04:20,664 --> 01:04:23,066
I'm not saying that it makes
sense, I'm...

1501
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:25,301
You're right, it makes
absolutely no sense, Alex.

1502
01:04:25,302 --> 01:04:27,203
It makes no fucking sense.

1503
01:04:27,204 --> 01:04:30,941
Do you have any idea what
I've been going through?

1504
01:04:30,942 --> 01:04:32,342
What I've been
thinking and feeling?

1505
01:04:32,343 --> 01:04:33,609
- Yes, yes I do. I do.
- You do?

1506
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:34,770
- Please tell me-
- I'm sorry.

1507
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:35,611
Oh you're sorry?

1508
01:04:35,612 --> 01:04:37,113
I was trying to get
in touch with you.

1509
01:04:37,114 --> 01:04:37,794
I have a job man!

1510
01:04:37,981 --> 01:04:39,114
Fucking duties!

1511
01:04:39,115 --> 01:04:40,049
I have a fucking deadline!

1512
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,084
Oh yeah, you were so busy?

1513
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,218
I have a fucking job! Yes I was
fucking busy!

1514
01:04:42,219 --> 01:04:44,299
When you were writing your
book that you haven't been

1515
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:45,955
writing for a year?

1516
01:04:45,956 --> 01:04:47,716
Is that what you were
doing that you couldn't

1517
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:50,067
answer the phone one time?

1518
01:05:03,641 --> 01:05:05,016
Ben...

1519
01:05:12,016 --> 01:05:13,984
Hey.

1520
01:05:13,985 --> 01:05:14,985
Hey, Sarah, come here.

1521
01:05:15,018 --> 01:05:16,653
What?

1522
01:05:16,654 --> 01:05:17,620
Look at me.

1523
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:19,055
Look at me.

1524
01:05:19,056 --> 01:05:20,756
Sarah...

1525
01:05:20,757 --> 01:05:24,326
I'm sorry, okay?

1526
01:05:24,327 --> 01:05:27,296
Sometimes things,
they need to be said.

1527
01:05:27,297 --> 01:05:34,706
And in those instances,
being an asshole comes in handy.

1528
01:05:35,706 --> 01:05:40,746
You okay?

1529
01:05:41,746 --> 01:05:43,046
Stop.

1530
01:05:43,047 --> 01:05:45,681
What?

1531
01:05:45,682 --> 01:05:47,450
Josh, stop.

1532
01:05:47,451 --> 01:05:50,220
Seriously.

1533
01:05:50,221 --> 01:05:52,288
Come on.

1534
01:05:52,289 --> 01:05:54,124
All that talk about death?

1535
01:05:54,125 --> 01:05:56,292
Eugh.

1536
01:05:56,293 --> 01:06:00,798
Tell me you don't want to.

1537
01:06:01,798 --> 01:06:03,466
No, stop.

1538
01:06:03,467 --> 01:06:05,368
What?

1539
01:06:05,369 --> 01:06:06,535
You know what I want?

1540
01:06:06,536 --> 01:06:10,707
I want you to have acted
like my boyfriend 7 years ago.

1541
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:14,310
Taken me to a movie, bought
me a fucking ice cream cone.

1542
01:06:14,311 --> 01:06:16,178
That's what I want.

1543
01:06:16,179 --> 01:06:18,747
Instead of being the guy
who permanently fucked up

1544
01:06:18,748 --> 01:06:22,252
my expectations
for normalcy in a relationship.

1545
01:06:22,253 --> 01:06:24,620
The guy that made me
explain to my mom that

1546
01:06:24,621 --> 01:06:27,524
"no, Josh isn't exactly
my boyfriend, he is just

1547
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:30,692
someone who sleeps with me
when he comes home pining

1548
01:06:30,693 --> 01:06:33,699
for my best friend, too
drunk to see straight."

1549
01:06:35,699 --> 01:06:37,667
Sarah, I was 20.

1550
01:06:37,668 --> 01:06:40,437
So was I.

1551
01:06:40,438 --> 01:06:41,571
I...

1552
01:06:41,572 --> 01:06:44,774
My dad had just left my mom.

1553
01:06:44,775 --> 01:06:46,509
Is that your excuse?

1554
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:48,544
I was angry.

1555
01:06:48,545 --> 01:06:50,212
Okay?

1556
01:06:50,213 --> 01:06:51,314
I was angry.

1557
01:06:51,315 --> 01:06:57,525
I was angry at my dad, I
was angry at fucking Ben.

1558
01:07:01,525 --> 01:07:07,150
What, you didn't even see
what you were doing to me?

1559
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:27,788
One minute.

1560
01:07:42,465 --> 01:07:44,399
<i>What's your name?</i>

1561
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,236
<i>Amber?</i>

1562
01:07:46,237 --> 01:07:48,471
<i>Wow, that's a pretty name.</i>

1563
01:07:48,472 --> 01:07:52,709
<i>How old are you?</i>

1564
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:54,343
What's up?

1565
01:07:54,344 --> 01:07:59,816
What's going on?

1566
01:07:59,817 --> 01:08:03,252
Man, I'm sorry about that Amber.

1567
01:08:03,253 --> 01:08:08,290
That's tough to feel like
you've finally found that

1568
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:12,629
person, the right
person for you and...

1569
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,701
They don't feel the same.

1570
01:08:17,701 --> 01:08:19,202
Mm.

1571
01:08:19,203 --> 01:08:21,638
Hey, Amber, Amber, Amber.

1572
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:26,309
Most people I know, most
people in the world,

1573
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:29,912
they're actually really afraid
to feel what you're feeling.

1574
01:08:29,913 --> 01:08:32,549
They won't even let themselves.

1575
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:35,385
But you, you're...

1576
01:08:35,386 --> 01:08:37,886
You're willing to go there.

1577
01:08:37,887 --> 01:08:44,727
And to me, that means
that you're very brave.

1578
01:08:44,728 --> 01:08:46,528
And...

1579
01:08:46,529 --> 01:08:51,515
To me that means that you
are going to be just fine.

1580
01:09:05,515 --> 01:09:08,718
Hey.

1581
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:09,719
<i>Hi.</i>

1582
01:09:12,389 --> 01:09:13,389
Hi.

1583
01:09:16,226 --> 01:09:19,328
Will you pinch me again?

1584
01:09:19,329 --> 01:09:22,398
What?

1585
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:29,304
On why you want to try?

1586
01:09:29,305 --> 01:09:31,907
I want to.

1587
01:09:31,908 --> 01:09:33,015
I'm ready.

1588
01:09:39,015 --> 01:09:42,020
I know.

1589
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:46,889
Tell me more.

1590
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:50,593
I just need reasons.

1591
01:09:50,594 --> 01:09:53,395
Why?

1592
01:09:53,396 --> 01:09:58,635
Because it turns
out that I'm not.

1593
01:09:58,636 --> 01:10:02,471
It turns out it
was a false alarm.

1594
01:10:02,472 --> 01:10:05,340
I guess I was just worried
that maybe you got caught up in

1595
01:10:05,341 --> 01:10:07,181
the moment and said some
things that you didn't

1596
01:10:07,381 --> 01:10:09,301
really mean, and maybe
someday you'd regret them,

1597
01:10:09,302 --> 01:10:10,679
so...

1598
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:13,585
I just...

1599
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:17,053
Ben...

1600
01:10:17,054 --> 01:10:19,488
Please say something.

1601
01:10:19,489 --> 01:10:22,726
I don't, I don't know.

1602
01:10:23,726 --> 01:10:27,934
It's not like I was
lying back there.

1603
01:10:30,934 --> 01:10:32,868
Um, maybe you're right.

1604
01:10:32,869 --> 01:10:35,079
Maybe...

1605
01:10:43,079 --> 01:10:44,079
What?

1606
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:48,984
Really?

1607
01:10:48,985 --> 01:10:52,988
I push you that
much and you fold?

1608
01:10:52,989 --> 01:10:53,989
You're not even fighting me.

1609
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:55,030
I don't know what it is...

1610
01:10:55,031 --> 01:10:56,471
Come on please,
don't, don't do that.

1611
01:10:56,472 --> 01:10:58,560
You always pretend like
you're the one that's all

1612
01:10:58,561 --> 01:11:01,096
in, when you know like I
know if I was writing, if

1613
01:11:01,097 --> 01:11:03,866
I was on, we wouldn't even
be having this conversation.

1614
01:11:03,867 --> 01:11:05,347
You wouldn't even
be opting out of our

1615
01:11:05,348 --> 01:11:08,071
relationship and flying
across the country to LA...

1616
01:11:08,072 --> 01:11:09,871
- Wherever the
- can you even hear yourself?

1617
01:11:09,872 --> 01:11:11,640
This wouldn't
be happening. You know...

1618
01:11:11,641 --> 01:11:14,010
Do you really think
that's what this is about?

1619
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:15,844
This is not about you.

1620
01:11:15,845 --> 01:11:17,647
This has nothing to
do with your writing.

1621
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:19,288
This has everything
to do with my writing.

1622
01:11:19,289 --> 01:11:22,266
It's always had everything
to do with my writing.

1623
01:11:44,942 --> 01:11:46,643
Busted.

1624
01:11:50,447 --> 01:11:52,715
That was a dramatic night.

1625
01:11:52,716 --> 01:11:54,884
Yeah.

1626
01:11:54,885 --> 01:11:56,419
I was serious about
dinner, by the way.

1627
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:57,519
It was so good.

1628
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,389
Oh, thank you.

1629
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:00,189
Shut up.

1630
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:02,392
You should open
your own restaurant.

1631
01:12:02,393 --> 01:12:05,127
Yeah, can you imagine that
conversation with my parents?

1632
01:12:05,128 --> 01:12:09,064
Fuck it. Do it anyway.

1633
01:12:09,065 --> 01:12:13,837
So what, you just give
up on what you want?

1634
01:12:14,837 --> 01:12:16,679
Who says that's what I want?

1635
01:12:24,581 --> 01:12:27,849
Okay, it's what I want.

1636
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:28,785
You happy?

1637
01:12:28,786 --> 01:12:30,791
Yeah, I totally am.

1638
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,157
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1639
01:12:35,158 --> 01:12:36,725
I'm sorry.

1640
01:12:36,726 --> 01:12:37,926
No no, it's okay.

1641
01:12:37,927 --> 01:12:40,696
I'm sorry.

1642
01:12:40,697 --> 01:12:42,864
Hey, don't take that
personally, okay?

1643
01:12:42,865 --> 01:12:44,901
- It's kind okay.
- Of like...

1644
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:46,903
A new policy of
mine, apparently.

1645
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:47,904
What's that mean?

1646
01:12:48,005 --> 01:12:50,473
Um, I just did the
same thing to Josh.

1647
01:12:50,474 --> 01:12:51,706
Oh, great.

1648
01:12:51,707 --> 01:12:53,578
Great.

1649
01:12:54,578 --> 01:12:55,678
Isaac, I'm, come on.

1650
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:57,981
I didn't mean it like that.

1651
01:12:58,981 --> 01:12:59,849
I'm sorry.

1652
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:00,730
That was embarrassing.

1653
01:13:00,731 --> 01:13:02,099
I thought that's
what you wanted.

1654
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:03,653
No, I did.

1655
01:13:03,654 --> 01:13:04,886
I do, believe me.

1656
01:13:04,887 --> 01:13:05,955
Apparently not anymore.

1657
01:13:05,956 --> 01:13:07,956
Well, for a long
time I did want that.

1658
01:13:07,957 --> 01:13:09,027
Okay.

1659
01:13:10,027 --> 01:13:11,027
But...

1660
01:13:12,128 --> 01:13:13,128
But...

1661
01:13:14,530 --> 01:13:16,467
But that's, it's
not what you want.

1662
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:18,547
You don't know what I want.

1663
01:13:18,548 --> 01:13:20,068
I-Isaac, you
don't want this.

1664
01:13:20,069 --> 01:13:23,208
Your 19 year-old
self wants this.

1665
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:26,908
You want closure.

1666
01:13:26,909 --> 01:13:30,813
You want...

1667
01:13:30,814 --> 01:13:37,519
I think you're afraid that this
thing with Kate might be real,

1668
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,623
you think it could be real.

1669
01:13:40,623 --> 01:13:42,032
Sarah...

1670
01:13:49,032 --> 01:13:50,265
How did it go?

1671
01:13:50,266 --> 01:13:52,535
I don't think I have
any blood on my hands.

1672
01:13:52,536 --> 01:13:53,502
That's great.

1673
01:13:53,503 --> 01:13:54,503
That's good.

1674
01:14:04,046 --> 01:14:05,046
Hey.

1675
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:07,595
Hey.

1676
01:14:19,595 --> 01:14:22,230
You've been quiet all weekend.

1677
01:14:22,231 --> 01:14:26,868
Everyone likes talking
more than listening.

1678
01:14:26,869 --> 01:14:28,737
Sometimes I just
get tired of it.

1679
01:14:28,738 --> 01:14:30,639
I prefer the opposite.

1680
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,042
Well, if that, that is not
a rare quality, I don't

1681
01:14:34,043 --> 01:14:35,148
know what is.

1682
01:14:38,148 --> 01:14:40,550
Ben didn't mean it.

1683
01:14:40,551 --> 01:14:44,586
What he said to you.

1684
01:14:44,587 --> 01:14:46,621
It's okay, I, I...

1685
01:14:46,622 --> 01:14:49,759
No it's not.

1686
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:55,864
It's not okay, what they did.

1687
01:14:55,865 --> 01:14:58,346
It's not okay what I did either.

1688
01:15:10,346 --> 01:15:14,183
Can I see?

1689
01:15:14,184 --> 01:15:17,719
Why?

1690
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:20,221
I don't know.

1691
01:15:20,222 --> 01:15:21,858
Okay.

1692
01:15:54,858 --> 01:16:01,686
You know we both
have to let it go.

1693
01:16:23,686 --> 01:16:25,023
Where you been?

1694
01:16:26,023 --> 01:16:31,429
Oh, attempting to
have sex with Sarah.

1695
01:16:32,429 --> 01:16:34,330
Good for her for
turning you down.

1696
01:16:34,331 --> 01:16:38,942
Heh, thank you.

1697
01:16:45,942 --> 01:16:49,344
You know, I can't remember
what happened last.

1698
01:16:49,345 --> 01:16:54,256
Me writing something good
or me and Siri having sex.

1699
01:16:58,856 --> 01:17:01,223
So basically what you're
saying is that you're

1700
01:17:01,224 --> 01:17:04,460
blocked in more ways than one.

1701
01:17:04,461 --> 01:17:07,266
Yeah, that's one way to put it.

1702
01:17:10,266 --> 01:17:15,071
To think that I've been
jealous of you for 7 years.

1703
01:17:15,072 --> 01:17:17,310
Hm.

1704
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:22,978
Looks like someone
made a friend.

1705
01:17:22,979 --> 01:17:27,953
He's the only one
that understands me.

1706
01:17:29,953 --> 01:17:31,754
What happened to everyone?

1707
01:17:31,755 --> 01:17:33,421
Isaac and Kate went to bed.

1708
01:17:33,422 --> 01:17:37,292
I guess Siri did too.

1709
01:17:37,293 --> 01:17:39,060
And what about Alex.

1710
01:17:39,061 --> 01:17:43,510
I thought he was with you.

1711
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:55,978
<i>Ben, wait wait wait.</i>

1712
01:17:55,979 --> 01:17:58,880
<i>Ben...</i>

1713
01:17:58,881 --> 01:18:00,384
Hey, did you find him?

1714
01:18:01,384 --> 01:18:03,184
Ben.

1715
01:18:03,185 --> 01:18:04,853
Ben!

1716
01:18:04,854 --> 01:18:06,087
What's going on?

1717
01:18:06,088 --> 01:18:08,157
Wait, wait, wait,
Ben, Ben, Ben Ben.

1718
01:18:08,158 --> 01:18:09,258
Please, please, please.

1719
01:18:09,259 --> 01:18:10,158
Just let me...

1720
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:11,799
What can you possibly
say to me right now?

1721
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,261
That I, I love you.

1722
01:18:13,262 --> 01:18:14,295
I really I do, more than
anyone in the world.

1723
01:18:14,296 --> 01:18:15,363
Fuck you!

1724
01:18:15,364 --> 01:18:17,198
Please-oh!

1725
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:18,542
Ow!

1726
01:18:25,542 --> 01:18:26,876
Wait, Ben Ben Ben.

1727
01:18:26,877 --> 01:18:31,112
Ben, please, please,
I'm sorry, okay, no!

1728
01:18:31,113 --> 01:18:32,113
Ben!

1729
01:18:32,114 --> 01:18:34,952
Ben!

1730
01:18:35,952 --> 01:18:38,086
Where are your keys!

1731
01:18:38,087 --> 01:18:40,456
Sarah, where are your keys?

1732
01:18:40,457 --> 01:18:44,559
I gave them to Ben.

1733
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,360
<i>The fuck's going on?</i>

1734
01:18:45,361 --> 01:18:46,429
<i>I don't know.</i>

1735
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,797
<i>I don't know. Everybody's
getting together with everybody.</i>

1736
01:18:48,798 --> 01:18:53,434
♪ I heard it was
a real good time ♪

1737
01:18:53,435 --> 01:18:54,836
♪ I heard it was... ♪

1738
01:18:54,837 --> 01:18:56,372
Fuck!

1739
01:19:05,381 --> 01:19:07,149
Shit!

1740
01:20:42,679 --> 01:20:47,483
<i>Judgment has a way of creeping
into every relationship.</i>

1741
01:20:47,484 --> 01:20:51,487
<i>Even the most intimate.</i>

1742
01:20:51,488 --> 01:20:53,408
<i>If we're lucky, somewhere
along the way we meet a</i>

1743
01:20:53,409 --> 01:21:03,032
<i>few people who listen to us
without criticism or reproach.</i>

1744
01:21:03,033 --> 01:21:05,402
<i>We call those
people our friends.</i>

1745
01:22:05,595 --> 01:22:08,697
Nice shiner.

1746
01:22:08,698 --> 01:22:12,600
Nice driving.

1747
01:22:12,601 --> 01:22:14,737
What are you doing?

1748
01:22:14,738 --> 01:22:16,015
Writing.

1749
01:22:25,015 --> 01:22:33,421
Um, I'm uh, I'm a
little fucked up.

1750
01:22:33,422 --> 01:22:36,558
No shit?

1751
01:22:36,559 --> 01:22:41,462
Can I play that card now?

1752
01:22:41,463 --> 01:22:44,105
Sure.

1753
01:22:50,105 --> 01:22:56,644
I um...

1754
01:22:56,645 --> 01:23:01,783
I know that uh...

1755
01:23:01,784 --> 01:23:02,751
That it's UN...

1756
01:23:02,752 --> 01:23:07,055
Unhealthy to...

1757
01:23:07,056 --> 01:23:10,425
To need, um...

1758
01:23:10,426 --> 01:23:14,095
T-just too much from
people, and I've been

1759
01:23:14,096 --> 01:23:17,398
working really hard on...

1760
01:23:17,399 --> 01:23:20,402
On, on trying to like...

1761
01:23:20,403 --> 01:23:26,841
Set up healthy, uh...

1762
01:23:26,842 --> 01:23:29,310
Ways of...

1763
01:23:29,311 --> 01:23:33,247
Communicating and...

1764
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:35,517
I don't, I don't know,
I don't know why.

1765
01:23:35,518 --> 01:23:37,419
Hey, the world's got
enough people you've gotta

1766
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:39,503
explain yourself to, right?

1767
01:23:54,503 --> 01:23:58,552
Tell me if that's shit or not.

1768
01:24:10,552 --> 01:24:13,554
Thanks for last
night, by the way.

1769
01:24:13,555 --> 01:24:14,489
For what?

1770
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:17,759
For rebuffing me.

1771
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,194
Hey, what are friends for.

1772
01:24:20,195 --> 01:24:22,563
I've been thinking a lot this
morning about investment.

1773
01:24:22,564 --> 01:24:24,166
Yeah, that's not
weird or anything.

1774
01:24:24,167 --> 01:24:24,807
No, I'm serious.

1775
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:27,803
I think you should
open your place.

1776
01:24:27,804 --> 01:24:29,044
Eh, that's not going to happen.

1777
01:24:29,045 --> 01:24:31,305
What if I helped you get
on your feet, get set up,

1778
01:24:31,306 --> 01:24:35,376
get a little seed
money or something?

1779
01:24:35,377 --> 01:24:38,779
Okay, I don't need
anything from you.

1780
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:40,648
I don't need help
or a favor or...

1781
01:24:40,649 --> 01:24:42,209
It wouldn't be a
favor, it'd be selfish.

1782
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:45,187
I'd be making money off of you.

1783
01:24:45,188 --> 01:24:46,388
You're not being serious.

1784
01:24:46,389 --> 01:24:47,822
I'm totally serious.

1785
01:24:47,823 --> 01:24:49,858
Believe it or not, I'm a
pretty savvy businessman.

1786
01:24:49,859 --> 01:24:51,760
I know, but...

1787
01:24:51,761 --> 01:24:53,121
But what? Come on,
think about it.

1788
01:24:53,122 --> 01:25:02,537
Small place, lower east side,
12 tables, food from upstate.

1789
01:25:02,538 --> 01:25:05,773
Well, naturally the food
would have to be from upstate.

1790
01:25:05,774 --> 01:25:08,309
The dishes would be a
tasteful nod to the area's

1791
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:11,612
fading Jewish and
Chinese denizens.

1792
01:25:11,613 --> 01:25:12,380
That's perfect.

1793
01:25:12,381 --> 01:25:14,316
Like uh, egg drop
matzo ball soup?

1794
01:25:14,317 --> 01:25:16,218
Yeah.

1795
01:25:16,219 --> 01:25:17,786
Szechuan brisket.

1796
01:25:17,787 --> 01:25:19,688
Got sweet and sour Kugel.

1797
01:25:19,689 --> 01:25:20,656
Mm.

1798
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:21,889
Kung Pao...

1799
01:25:21,890 --> 01:25:23,625
Latkes?

1800
01:25:23,626 --> 01:25:25,426
Mm. That sounds really good.

1801
01:25:25,427 --> 01:25:26,327
That sounds terrible.

1802
01:25:26,328 --> 01:25:28,796
That does sound terrible.

1803
01:25:28,797 --> 01:25:30,965
What do you say?

1804
01:25:30,966 --> 01:25:34,872
Shake on it?

1805
01:25:36,472 --> 01:25:38,592
<i>Hey, you've reached Ben Kaplan's
cell phone.</i>

1806
01:25:38,593 --> 01:25:41,265
<i>Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

1807
01:25:43,246 --> 01:25:46,715
He's just blowing off steam.

1808
01:25:46,716 --> 01:25:48,817
Josh, I really fucked up.

1809
01:25:48,818 --> 01:25:51,286
I know.

1810
01:25:51,287 --> 01:25:53,755
He'll get past it.

1811
01:25:53,756 --> 01:25:55,890
It's ironic, though.

1812
01:25:55,891 --> 01:25:57,593
Why?

1813
01:25:57,594 --> 01:25:59,554
I just thought that if you
were ever going to slip

1814
01:25:59,555 --> 01:26:02,491
up, it would be with me.

1815
01:26:23,286 --> 01:26:24,385
Thanks for the ride.

1816
01:26:24,386 --> 01:26:26,688
Yeah.

1817
01:26:26,689 --> 01:26:28,991
So you'll, you'll
consider the offer?

1818
01:26:28,992 --> 01:26:32,394
Yeah, absolutely.

1819
01:26:32,395 --> 01:26:36,497
It's really fucking
good, you know?

1820
01:26:36,498 --> 01:26:39,802
Quite an auspicious start.

1821
01:26:40,802 --> 01:26:44,572
I guess I have you to
thank for that also.

1822
01:26:44,573 --> 01:26:47,720
Well...

1823
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:58,620
Good dog!

1824
01:26:58,621 --> 01:27:01,560
Hey Timmy.

1825
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:06,728
Thanks guys.

1826
01:27:06,729 --> 01:27:08,697
Happy I passed on the insurance.

1827
01:27:08,698 --> 01:27:12,667
Tell them it was an elk.

1828
01:27:12,668 --> 01:27:14,870
In the shape of a tree?

1829
01:27:14,871 --> 01:27:18,641
It jumped out like an elk.

1830
01:27:19,641 --> 01:27:21,082
<i>He really can't drive.</i>

1831
01:27:26,082 --> 01:27:28,582
Alex, you got any crazy
glue in the house?

1832
01:27:28,583 --> 01:27:30,858
<i>You won't even notice.</i>

1833
01:27:35,858 --> 01:27:38,359
So, do you hate me?

1834
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:39,627
No.

1835
01:27:39,628 --> 01:27:42,702
I could never do that.

1836
01:27:45,702 --> 01:27:48,805
Are you sure?

1837
01:27:49,805 --> 01:27:51,072
Yeah.

1838
01:27:51,073 --> 01:27:52,976
I'm sure.

1839
01:27:57,513 --> 01:27:59,673
You know, I couldn't
believe my luck freshman

1840
01:27:59,674 --> 01:28:02,917
year when I found out your
place was across the hall.

1841
01:28:02,918 --> 01:28:07,421
Then when we actually
spoke, it was like I

1842
01:28:07,422 --> 01:28:10,692
wanted to throw away all
ideas of dumb luck and

1843
01:28:10,693 --> 01:28:14,763
start invoking God and
fate and a bunch of other

1844
01:28:14,764 --> 01:28:15,764
capitalized words.

1845
01:28:16,032 --> 01:28:18,032
Ben why are you
saying this right now?

1846
01:28:18,033 --> 01:28:19,993
'Cause when good things
happen, you always want to

1847
01:28:19,994 --> 01:28:24,868
imagine them as fated.

1848
01:28:25,742 --> 01:28:29,577
And when bad things happen, of
course the world's this

1849
01:28:29,578 --> 01:28:35,951
cold and brutally random place.

1850
01:28:35,952 --> 01:28:38,786
I'm scared of what the
world'd look like without you.

1851
01:28:38,787 --> 01:28:43,425
You can't stay with me
because you're scared.

1852
01:28:43,426 --> 01:28:45,063
You're right.

1853
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:54,536
How was that for an
introduction to my friends?

1854
01:28:54,537 --> 01:28:58,474
A bigger disaster than I
could possibly imagine.

1855
01:29:00,176 --> 01:29:02,778
You're telling me.

1856
01:29:02,779 --> 01:29:04,912
Now you're going to dump
me as soon as we're not

1857
01:29:04,913 --> 01:29:07,849
stuck together at 30,000 feet.

1858
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:09,951
What are you talking about?

1859
01:29:09,952 --> 01:29:11,552
What do you mean what
am I talking about.

1860
01:29:11,553 --> 01:29:12,619
You just said it yourself.

1861
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:13,620
I'm...

1862
01:29:14,023 --> 01:29:16,157
I've made a total
fool of myself.

1863
01:29:16,158 --> 01:29:17,992
Baby, my friends
are the disaster.

1864
01:29:17,993 --> 01:29:19,693
You're amazing.

1865
01:29:19,694 --> 01:29:20,594
That's not true.

1866
01:29:20,595 --> 01:29:21,595
That's totally true.

1867
01:29:21,596 --> 01:29:24,467
You're the only sane
person here and you know it.

1868
01:29:25,467 --> 01:29:26,872
Hey.

1869
01:29:30,872 --> 01:29:32,188
I'm really glad you came.

1870
01:29:35,077 --> 01:29:36,644
You ready to meet my parents?

1871
01:29:36,645 --> 01:29:39,648
I don't think so.

1872
01:29:39,649 --> 01:29:42,082
I don't blame you. They're
fucking crazy.

1873
01:29:42,083 --> 01:29:44,957
Good Timmy.

1874
01:29:47,957 --> 01:29:52,527
So, we are all doomed,
romantically speaking.

1875
01:29:52,528 --> 01:29:55,730
Only on like a
deep karmic level.

1876
01:29:57,033 --> 01:29:59,612
For whatever reason, I'm
strangely okay with that.

1877
01:30:01,069 --> 01:30:02,237
- Yeah?
- What?

1878
01:30:02,238 --> 01:30:05,206
Maybe I'm turning
over a new leaf.

1879
01:30:05,207 --> 01:30:07,087
Maybe we should make one
of those pacts where if

1880
01:30:07,088 --> 01:30:11,712
we're still single when we're
35, we all just get married.

1881
01:30:11,713 --> 01:30:12,714
Who, the three of us?

1882
01:30:12,715 --> 01:30:15,817
Yes, and Timmy of course.

1883
01:30:15,818 --> 01:30:18,620
We'll make a great
dysfunctional family.

1884
01:30:18,621 --> 01:30:19,621
How's that sound Timmy?

1885
01:30:19,622 --> 01:30:21,893
I'd consider it.

1886
01:30:23,893 --> 01:30:25,693
Oh, hey, you going so soon?

1887
01:30:25,694 --> 01:30:27,496
<i>Flight to catch.</i>

1888
01:30:27,497 --> 01:30:29,137
We'll see if I can
rustle up Ben and Siri.

1889
01:30:29,138 --> 01:30:30,831
Thanks for coming, man.

1890
01:30:30,832 --> 01:30:31,767
See you soon, I hear?

1891
01:30:31,768 --> 01:30:33,535
Yeah, hopefully at
the end of the month.

1892
01:30:33,536 --> 01:30:34,669
I'm excited.

1893
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:35,769
What does that mean?

1894
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:37,690
Alex asked if there was
any openings at the place

1895
01:30:37,691 --> 01:30:39,358
I work, and I told
him there was a strong

1896
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:41,809
likelihood I could
get him a job.

1897
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:43,545
That's awesome.

1898
01:30:43,546 --> 01:30:44,513
Congratulations.

1899
01:30:44,514 --> 01:30:45,880
Thanks.

1900
01:30:45,881 --> 01:30:48,183
I think I have a strong resume.

1901
01:30:48,184 --> 01:30:50,285
Is that a suicide joke?

1902
01:30:50,286 --> 01:30:51,287
Too soon.

1903
01:31:01,029 --> 01:31:03,098
I'm going to miss you guys.

1904
01:31:03,099 --> 01:31:03,732
Not me.

1905
01:31:03,932 --> 01:31:06,134
I'll be checking
on my investment.

1906
01:31:06,135 --> 01:31:07,836
Ha, what investment?

1907
01:31:07,837 --> 01:31:09,103
Sarah's opening a restaurant.

1908
01:31:09,104 --> 01:31:10,804
- No I'm not.
- Is.

1909
01:31:10,805 --> 01:31:12,239
- No, what?
- He's...

1910
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:13,174
Crazy.

1911
01:31:13,175 --> 01:31:13,810
<i>Sarah.</i>

1912
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:15,010
What?

1913
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:16,891
Take the money before he
gets an even worse idea

1914
01:31:16,892 --> 01:31:18,763
what to do with it.

1915
01:31:21,716 --> 01:31:23,020
Where's your stuff?

1916
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:26,587
Yeah, about that.

1917
01:31:26,588 --> 01:31:27,956
I uh...

1918
01:31:27,957 --> 01:31:29,590
I think I'm hanging
around a while.

1919
01:31:29,591 --> 01:31:32,193
Seems like Ben got a good
idea for a story last

1920
01:31:32,194 --> 01:31:36,063
night and, so I told him
he should stay and write.

1921
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:37,765
So staying was an option?

1922
01:31:37,766 --> 01:31:38,800
You, you could stay.

1923
01:31:38,801 --> 01:31:39,667
I don't want to stay.

1924
01:31:39,668 --> 01:31:40,301
You want to stay?

1925
01:31:40,302 --> 01:31:41,303
No, I don't want to stay.

1926
01:31:41,304 --> 01:31:43,024
I'm sorry, can we take
a group photo please?

1927
01:31:43,025 --> 01:31:43,772
Yes.

1928
01:31:43,773 --> 01:31:44,305
I thought, I thought
we talked about this.

1929
01:31:44,306 --> 01:31:45,974
I know, but please.

1930
01:31:45,975 --> 01:31:48,242
You've got time for
exactly one photo.

1931
01:31:48,243 --> 01:31:49,176
Here, I'll take it.

1932
01:31:49,177 --> 01:31:50,045
Thank you Kate.

1933
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:51,145
Thank you.

1934
01:31:51,146 --> 01:31:52,306
<i>The car is dying to be in it.</i>

1935
01:31:52,307 --> 01:31:53,948
<i>We have to.</i>

1936
01:31:53,949 --> 01:31:55,829
<i>Yeah, and don't forget
to get my shoes in baby.</i>

1937
01:31:55,830 --> 01:31:56,751
<i>Oho, please.</i>

1938
01:31:56,752 --> 01:31:58,319
<i>Frame up for the shoes, please.</i>

1939
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,202
<i>It's the most important part.</i>

1940
01:32:13,202 --> 01:32:14,135
Alex, right?

1941
01:32:14,136 --> 01:32:15,202
Yeah.

1942
01:32:15,203 --> 01:32:16,677
You can join us if you want.

1943
01:32:17,006 --> 01:32:19,679
Oh, cool thanks.

1944
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:26,313
I send you on a mission
for sugar, you bring back

1945
01:32:26,314 --> 01:32:27,849
a lost boy.

1946
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:28,950
Hey man, I'm Josh.

1947
01:32:28,951 --> 01:32:31,118
Hey, Alex.

1948
01:32:31,119 --> 01:32:33,087
Um, I don't think we met. I'm
Ben.

1949
01:32:33,088 --> 01:32:33,722
Siri.

1950
01:32:33,922 --> 01:32:34,488
Oh, I'm sorry.

1951
01:32:34,489 --> 01:32:35,756
Ben, Siri. Siri, Ben.

1952
01:32:35,757 --> 01:32:36,825
Nice to meet you.

1953
01:32:36,826 --> 01:32:38,827
I think we're in the same dorm.

1954
01:32:38,828 --> 01:32:39,961
Yeah. Yeah?

1955
01:32:39,962 --> 01:32:45,969
Exactly. That's... shocking I
haven't met you before.

1956
01:32:46,969 --> 01:32:49,203
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

1957
01:32:49,204 --> 01:32:50,037
Isaac.

1958
01:32:50,038 --> 01:32:51,272
Josh.

1959
01:32:51,273 --> 01:32:53,041
Did you get enough
macaroni and cheese?

1960
01:32:53,042 --> 01:32:54,242
Shut up, Josh.

1961
01:32:54,243 --> 01:32:55,376
Did you order the Mountain?

1962
01:32:55,377 --> 01:32:56,911
Sh-I got this. Shut up Josh.

1963
01:32:56,912 --> 01:32:58,015
Hi. I'm Sarah.

1964
01:32:59,015 --> 01:33:00,047
Hi, Alex.

1965
01:33:00,048 --> 01:33:01,049
Nice to meet you.

1966
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:02,336
Nice to meet you too.

1967
01:33:04,953 --> 01:33:07,354
Ignore him, anything he says.

1968
01:33:07,355 --> 01:33:09,189
Can you believe these guys?

1969
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:10,729
I'm sure you'll fit right in.

1970
01:33:13,729 --> 01:33:17,264
Ben, want to just take a
solo, or do you want to

1971
01:33:17,265 --> 01:33:19,072
join the group?

1972
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:24,306
Come on.

1973
01:33:25,306 --> 01:33:27,110
Alright, posture everyone.

1974
01:33:28,710 --> 01:33:30,978
Uh, I'm going to need
you to get a lot closer

1975
01:33:30,979 --> 01:33:33,382
together than that.

1976
01:33:34,382 --> 01:33:35,450
Okay.

1977
01:33:35,451 --> 01:33:36,984
Come on, come on.

1978
01:33:36,985 --> 01:33:37,952
Alright.

1979
01:33:37,953 --> 01:33:39,553
I'm going to pose a
quick idea, you guys.

1980
01:33:39,554 --> 01:33:42,024
Maybe next time we
do this, it's a happy occasion.

1981
01:33:42,624 --> 01:33:43,904
Is there going to
be a next time?

1982
01:33:43,926 --> 01:33:44,826
Uh oh.

1983
01:33:44,827 --> 01:33:46,461
- Okay.
- Alex...

1984
01:33:46,462 --> 01:33:49,465
One, two...
