1
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:15,604
Open up, bitch.

2
00:01:15,605 --> 00:01:18,699
- What's up?
- Hey.

3
00:01:19,742 --> 00:01:21,743
- Oh, it's cute.
- Do you like?

4
00:01:21,744 --> 00:01:23,579
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

5
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,674
Yeah, I thought it'd go good
with my eyes anyway.

6
00:01:28,952 --> 00:01:32,546
That is pretty.
I like that.

7
00:01:33,924 --> 00:01:36,326
That sparkles.
I'm breaking up with Pete.

8
00:01:36,327 --> 00:01:38,361
You made out
with Tyler Winters?

9
00:01:38,362 --> 00:01:39,863
Oh.

10
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:42,765
Oh, my butt is so fat right now.

11
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:48,104
Mine shakes
more than yours.

12
00:01:48,105 --> 00:01:50,573
Have you heard of this new thing where
you can get your asshole bleached?

13
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:52,909
- Ew.
- No, I'm serious.

14
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,644
It's like this new thing
in all the salons.

15
00:01:54,645 --> 00:01:57,447
It first started with strippers
and porn stars,

16
00:01:57,448 --> 00:01:58,848
but now, like,
everybody is doing it.

17
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:00,517
You know, it just kind of
lightens the color.

18
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:02,285
See how mine's a little darker?

19
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:04,922
Get your butthole out of my face.

20
00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:07,491
- Is mine dark too?
- Yeah, a little bit.

21
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:09,093
- Really?
- Yeah.

22
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:11,962
You know, we should find a place
here in the mall who does it.

23
00:02:11,963 --> 00:02:14,431
Uh-huh.
Your butt looks okay to me.

24
00:02:14,432 --> 00:02:16,133
Yeah, you coming onto me now?

25
00:02:16,134 --> 00:02:18,502
Oh, Holly, faster.

26
00:02:18,503 --> 00:02:21,872
I love your bleached butthole.
It's so baby pink.

27
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:25,766
What are you doing?

28
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:29,146
I'm putting my clothes back on.

29
00:02:29,147 --> 00:02:31,315
Oh, did I forget
to take something off?

30
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:33,717
Hmm, I must be losing my mind.

31
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:35,520
Come on, Sherri, don't.
We're just gonna get caught.

32
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:38,089
Let's go.
Come on.

33
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,923
Come on, it'll be okay.

34
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,358
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

35
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:03,481
I know.

36
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,046
I know.

37
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:17,997
Hey, girls, hold on.
Hey.

38
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:20,566
- Oh my God, Mr. Krebbs.
- Yes.

39
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,535
- Holly, it's Mr. Krebbs.
- Hi, Mr. Krebbs.

40
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,670
How are you?
A little after-school shopping are we?

41
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,539
We're gonna go home right away
and do our homework.

42
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,441
- Yeah.
- I swear.

43
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,942
Yeah, I bet.

44
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,345
- I like your purse.
- Yes.

45
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,847
- But it doesn't go with your shoes.
- Thank you.

46
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,617
I accessorize.
I'm always holding the bag.

47
00:03:36,618 --> 00:03:38,552
Here's my wife.
Hey.

48
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:40,821
- Hi.
- Honey, these are two of my students.

49
00:03:40,822 --> 00:03:43,223
Sherri and-
oh, this is my wife.

50
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,192
- Hello.
- Have you met my wife before?

51
00:03:45,193 --> 00:03:47,761
Once at a school play,
but you weren't so...

52
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:50,964
Oh, no kidding.
Only five more weeks.

53
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:54,134
- Yeah, wow. Epidural, huh?
- Yeah.

54
00:03:54,135 --> 00:03:57,237
Well, speaking of going,
we have to go 'cause we're gonna be late.

55
00:03:57,238 --> 00:04:00,007
My dad's picking us up
so we'll see you in class.

56
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:01,541
- I hope so.
- Bye, Mr. Krebbs.

57
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,477
- Bye.
- See you. Bye.

58
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:06,914
Honey, let's get those towels
and get out of here.

59
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:08,848
My back is killing me.

60
00:04:10,986 --> 00:04:13,716
Hey, wait!
Hey! Hey!

61
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:17,358
Missed 'em.

62
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,427
Poor Mr. Krebbs.

63
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:21,729
He has to be stuck
with that fat ugly pig.

64
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,231
Dude, she's pregnant.

65
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:25,700
What is he doing with her anyway?

66
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:28,369
He was so wanting
to fuck us just then.

67
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,771
Ew, he's like 50.

68
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:33,366
- No, try like his 30s, dumbass.
- Whatever.

69
00:04:36,578 --> 00:04:38,580
No, he was checking us out.

70
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:40,549
I think he's kind of hot.

71
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,051
Oh shit.

72
00:04:42,052 --> 00:04:44,687
- Did anybody see?
- No, just go.

73
00:04:44,688 --> 00:04:46,678
Oh my God.

74
00:04:50,427 --> 00:04:52,451
Yes.

75
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:57,666
Woman on P.A.:
Tony, could you come to towels, please?

76
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:00,102
Tony, these folks are giving
towels as a gift

77
00:05:00,103 --> 00:05:02,071
and they want to know
what our exchange policy is.

78
00:05:02,072 --> 00:05:04,907
- If we still give cash back or...
- Oh, I'm afraid not.

79
00:05:04,908 --> 00:05:06,475
- No, sorry.
- That's what I was afraid of.

80
00:05:06,476 --> 00:05:07,777
We don't give cash back anymore.

81
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:10,380
But they can get credit to use
anywhere in the store.

82
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:12,248
And you can use it
not just at this store

83
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:14,584
but any of our stores
across the entire country.

84
00:05:14,585 --> 00:05:16,152
- Okay.
- So it's great.

85
00:05:16,153 --> 00:05:18,888
- Can I get my credit card back?
- Yeah, of course.

86
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:20,256
And here's your receipt.

87
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:22,959
Hey, we're having a great sale
on maternity upstairs.

88
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,894
- You guys should check it out.
- We're gonna pop.

89
00:05:24,895 --> 00:05:27,163
- You're ready to go?
- Almost ready, yeah.

90
00:05:27,164 --> 00:05:29,232
I'll call cleanup.

91
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:31,468
That was good.
That's lovely.

92
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:33,837
- Have a good one, guys.
- Okay, take care, you guys.

93
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:36,238
That's why we have the towels.

94
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:39,677
You are so bad.

95
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:41,779
It's not my fault.
You're wearing those pants again.

96
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,814
That guy's so funny.

97
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:47,648
- Oh, so you like Mr. Slick Manager guy?
- Yeah, right.

98
00:05:48,353 --> 00:05:50,554
I can tell you're not wearing
a thong, are you?

99
00:05:50,555 --> 00:05:52,454
No.

100
00:05:54,226 --> 00:05:55,960
You're not wearing any underwear?

101
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:58,462
I am barebacking it
all the way.

102
00:05:58,463 --> 00:06:01,265
You are like a little vixen.

103
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:03,200
A little minx.

104
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:06,270
Put you in our company
catalogue and eat you up.

105
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:07,938
Come into the storeroom
with me right now.

106
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:10,342
- You are crazy.
- Come on, who's gonna know?

107
00:06:10,343 --> 00:06:11,977
Forget it.

108
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:14,045
You liked it last time, didn't you?

109
00:06:14,046 --> 00:06:16,648
No, I hated every second of it.
All four of them.

110
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:18,683
- Oh, right.
- Now go away.

111
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:20,752
You're gonna get us fired.
Go.

112
00:06:20,753 --> 00:06:23,388
Who cares?
This place sucks.

113
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:25,223
- We'll get better jobs.
- Yeah?

114
00:06:25,224 --> 00:06:28,560
I'll become a professional magician.
You could be my assistant.

115
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:31,263
- There's big money in magic.
- Yeah, sure.

116
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:32,964
Great.

117
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:35,734
What, you don't trust me with a saw
and the whole cutting-you-in-half routine?

118
00:06:35,735 --> 00:06:37,936
Stop it.

119
00:06:37,937 --> 00:06:40,706
If you're such a good magician
why don't you just disappear?

120
00:06:40,707 --> 00:06:42,902
Okay?

121
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:46,312
The store is empty.

122
00:06:46,313 --> 00:06:48,114
Just take your break now.

123
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:50,783
- I promise I'll be quick.
- Oh, I know you'll be quick.

124
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:53,013
Good one.

125
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:56,284
What do you say?

126
00:06:57,558 --> 00:07:00,359
Let me just tell Marian
I'm gonna take my break now.

127
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,623
Thattagirl.

128
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,866
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

129
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:08,434
Can you help me?

130
00:07:08,435 --> 00:07:10,704
- My wife is redoing the bathroom...
- Uh-huh.

131
00:07:10,705 --> 00:07:12,973
...and she wants it to be
pretty much like this.

132
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,608
Okay.

133
00:07:14,609 --> 00:07:17,478
You know, she wants
to cover the toilet.

134
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,814
Okay. We're gonna have to take
inventory a little bit later.

135
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,250
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Yeah, okay.

136
00:07:23,251 --> 00:07:24,618
So you take care.
Okay.

137
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:26,220
I notice you have
different kinds of blues.

138
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:28,689
Yes, we do.
We have the aqua.

139
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,818
Man:
Baby blue. She loves baby blue.

140
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:35,929
- Great coverage.
- I like that.

141
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,232
- Hey-o. Hey, Grace.
- Hey, Tony.

142
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:40,502
Good afternoon, ma'am.
You're in good hands here.

143
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,604
- Grace is the best.
- I can see that.

144
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:45,507
That is the perfect color on you.

145
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,108
Isn't that the perfect
color on her, Grace?

146
00:07:47,109 --> 00:07:48,776
Oh, absolutely.

147
00:07:48,777 --> 00:07:51,779
The earth tones definitely
enhance your skin tone.

148
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,748
- Really?
- It really is great.

149
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:55,049
- She did a great job.
- Oh, thank you.

150
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,018
Grace, when you get done
helping this lovely lady,

151
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,486
would you meet me in the storeroom?

152
00:07:58,487 --> 00:07:59,854
I want to go over those
inventory problems.

153
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,523
- Okay.
- Great. Have a good one.

154
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:03,218
- You look great.
- Thank you.

155
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,155
What?

156
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:09,284
How did the-

157
00:09:30,082 --> 00:09:31,983
I'm so sorry.

158
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:34,452
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

159
00:09:34,453 --> 00:09:36,721
No, I'm not okay,
you stupid bitch.

160
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:39,256
I'm so sorry.

161
00:09:39,257 --> 00:09:40,958
Listen, it was an accident.

162
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,829
Accident?
I'll show you accident.

163
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:50,001
Here's your accident.

164
00:09:50,703 --> 00:09:54,229
Fucking step down, you fuck.

165
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:58,844
Can I help you?

166
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:00,879
Cut! Cut!
Fuck!

167
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,648
- Dan, deal with this.
- Cut cut.

168
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:04,844
Sir, excuse me.
We're in the middle of a movie.

169
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:54,702
Hey, Marty.
How are you doing?

170
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:56,136
Hey, Stephanie.

171
00:10:56,137 --> 00:10:57,938
I'd be doing a lot better if

172
00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:00,607
the ATM machine
hadn't eaten my card.

173
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:02,476
Okay.

174
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:06,847
So, um...

175
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,662
God.

176
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:23,865
Oh my God.
I swear to God I'm gonna throw up.

177
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:26,735
I'm gonna throw up.
Oh my God! Oh my God!

178
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:28,703
What crawled up his ass and died?

179
00:11:44,888 --> 00:11:47,089
Marty:
Phil Howard, please. Oh, hi, Phil.

180
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,225
We've got some good news for you.

181
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:51,761
We reviewed your claim
and we decided

182
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:53,829
it's best just to consider
your car totaled.

183
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,065
So you will be getting a check

184
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:59,401
in the amount of $4,552.

185
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:03,167
Of course you'll be responsible
for the $500 deductable.

186
00:12:10,714 --> 00:12:13,182
I'm sorry, Phil.
Can I just call you right back, please?

187
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,447
Thank you very much.

188
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:56,227
You are an A-hole, Stuart.

189
00:12:56,228 --> 00:12:58,262
Marty, can't you see I'm working?

190
00:12:58,263 --> 00:13:01,933
I am tired of your practical jokes.

191
00:13:01,934 --> 00:13:03,768
What the hell did you
put into my Coke?

192
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:05,937
In your Coke?
You're crazy.

193
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:08,639
Just stop it.
Just leave me alone.

194
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,042
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about, okay?

195
00:13:11,043 --> 00:13:13,044
Is there a problem, gentlemen?

196
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:15,314
Mr. Stonecipher,

197
00:13:15,315 --> 00:13:18,083
I am tired of Stuart
and his practical jokes.

198
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:21,353
I try to be professional
and I try to do a good job,

199
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:23,922
but he won't stop torturing me.

200
00:13:23,923 --> 00:13:26,592
Mr. Stonecipher, that's not true.
I mean, he's insane.

201
00:13:26,593 --> 00:13:28,427
Insane?

202
00:13:28,428 --> 00:13:33,232
He put pickle juice or something
in my Coke while I was down at the ATM.

203
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:36,034
Then when I came back I drank it,
I thought I'd been poisoned.

204
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:38,526
- Pickle juice?
- Yeah, okay-

205
00:13:40,373 --> 00:13:42,966
Smell.

206
00:13:49,316 --> 00:13:51,477
That's Coke, Marty.

207
00:13:57,124 --> 00:13:59,558
What?

208
00:14:14,141 --> 00:14:16,410
All right, how's that?
Can you see everything?

209
00:14:16,411 --> 00:14:19,213
Move it to the left a little bit
so you can see the whole couch.

210
00:14:19,214 --> 00:14:21,248
- My left or your left?
- Your left.

211
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:24,752
No no, my left. Sorry.

212
00:14:24,753 --> 00:14:26,487
Yeah, it's completely hidden.

213
00:14:26,488 --> 00:14:28,355
I mean, I know it's there
and I can hardly see it.

214
00:14:28,356 --> 00:14:31,659
All right, good. I'm gonna do the one
in the nursery after dinner in the bear.

215
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,960
Good.

216
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:34,929
Not in the bear.
That's gonna be the first place she looks.

217
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,464
- She'll never look there.
- Nannies are hip to this stuff.

218
00:14:37,465 --> 00:14:38,999
She's gonna be looking
for the nanny-cams.

219
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,069
Having a complete stranger come into
the house and take care of the baby

220
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,038
makes me very nervous.

221
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:46,273
The last time was a sign
not to do it again.

222
00:14:46,274 --> 00:14:48,076
Yeah, well, we have cameras now.

223
00:14:48,077 --> 00:14:51,246
Oh good, so when we come home
and we find the baby's got a broken neck

224
00:14:51,247 --> 00:14:53,114
we can just rewind the tape and say,

225
00:14:53,115 --> 00:14:55,283
"Oh look, there's the nanny
shaking the baby. "

226
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:57,852
- You decapitated it.
- No I didn't.

227
00:14:57,853 --> 00:14:59,843
It's okay, I can fix it.

228
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:02,524
There you go.
All right, what do you say?

229
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:04,893
I see this shit every day.

230
00:15:04,894 --> 00:15:07,562
Ben, you see?
I told you.

231
00:15:07,563 --> 00:15:09,264
Megan, please don't say
words like that.

232
00:15:09,265 --> 00:15:12,167
- You know what I would love?
- What's that?

233
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:15,837
I would really love for you
to make the salad.

234
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:17,206
Okay.

235
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,875
No no, huh-uh, Megan.
Don't touch the soft spot.

236
00:15:19,876 --> 00:15:21,444
Remember, we talked
about that, okay?

237
00:15:21,445 --> 00:15:23,946
But I was only touching it softly.

238
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:26,182
I know, but you
shouldn't touch it at all.

239
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:29,345
You know what?
We don't need this on while it's just us.

240
00:15:33,256 --> 00:15:35,519
Whip it good.

241
00:16:01,052 --> 00:16:03,577
I'm done.

242
00:16:13,231 --> 00:16:16,859
Willie:
Oh, fuck yeah, man.

243
00:16:19,638 --> 00:16:21,606
I'm gonna fucking film it.

244
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:24,242
Aw, yeah.

245
00:16:24,243 --> 00:16:26,611
How about that, man?
Would you sink it in that?

246
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,179
Carl:
Who me?

247
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,182
No, I hate perfect
beautiful teenage bodies.

248
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:33,583
Idiot.

249
00:16:34,753 --> 00:16:37,755
Oh man, she's showing us
the toothless smile.

250
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:41,125
God, look at that bitch
in the blue top, man.

251
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,161
They've been in here before, man.

252
00:16:43,162 --> 00:16:45,263
You think they're under 18, man?

253
00:16:45,264 --> 00:16:46,798
Fuck yeah.
Way under.

254
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,767
Oh, I never can fucking tell.

255
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:51,437
They came in and I sold them
booze and smokes once.

256
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:53,530
Oh well, fuck it.

257
00:17:01,781 --> 00:17:04,616
Tell you what:
Once I get my fucking record deal, man,

258
00:17:04,617 --> 00:17:07,820
it ain't gonna matter how old,
how fucking ugly I am.

259
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:11,824
All these hot teenyboppers
are gonna be fucking lining up

260
00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:15,227
to gobble the grits from
my fucking groin straw, man.

261
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:18,030
Listen to this fucking new tune.
It's called "Electrocuted. "

262
00:17:18,031 --> 00:17:19,632
I wrote it last night, man.

263
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:21,501
"Electrocuted"?

264
00:17:21,502 --> 00:17:24,637
Yeah, it's about a guy's
electrocution in the death house.

265
00:17:24,638 --> 00:17:26,706
Ready?
Dig it, man.

266
00:17:33,681 --> 00:17:37,383

284
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:35,772
Ahem.

285
00:19:01,538 --> 00:19:03,372
All right, thanks.

286
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:06,205
Ahem.

287
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,605
Oh shit.

288
00:22:18,374 --> 00:22:19,941
That was a close one.

289
00:22:19,942 --> 00:22:22,344
No, you know what?
Tony, we shouldn't do this anymore.

290
00:22:22,345 --> 00:22:25,448
Indeed.
Now bend over.

291
00:22:25,449 --> 00:22:27,884
No no, Tony.
I'm serious. I feel bad.

292
00:22:27,885 --> 00:22:30,253
Look, don't get all freaked out
just 'cause Marian came in.

293
00:22:30,254 --> 00:22:31,854
She didn't see us.
No one suspects a thing.

294
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:34,424
No, it's not that.
I'm a mother with children.

295
00:22:34,425 --> 00:22:38,127
All right, all the more reason you
deserve to have a little fun, you know?

296
00:22:38,128 --> 00:22:39,862
You've earned it.

297
00:22:39,863 --> 00:22:41,898
If my husband found out,
he'd kill us both.

298
00:22:41,899 --> 00:22:44,167
I got an idea.

299
00:22:44,168 --> 00:22:46,035
- What?
- Don't tell him.

300
00:22:46,036 --> 00:22:48,438
Okay, wait. Wait.

301
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:50,406
All right, but this is the last time.

302
00:22:50,407 --> 00:22:53,501
- Okay, whatever you say.
- You are so full of shit.

303
00:23:07,425 --> 00:23:10,621
Quit it, Tyler.
You're gonna mess up my makeup.

304
00:23:14,032 --> 00:23:16,200
Ew, get a room.

305
00:23:16,201 --> 00:23:18,502
I've got to go, yo.
I'll text you later.

306
00:23:18,503 --> 00:23:21,171
Ahem.

307
00:23:21,172 --> 00:23:24,308
So it looks like you and Tyler
aren't a secret any longer.

308
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:26,945
Whatever.
I'm over Tyler.

309
00:23:26,946 --> 00:23:29,247
Already?
Yeah, it didn't look like it.

310
00:23:29,248 --> 00:23:31,249
He's an idiot.

311
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,184
And he's hung like a mouse.

312
00:23:33,185 --> 00:23:35,720
I'm dumping him after
the Ludacris concert.

313
00:23:35,721 --> 00:23:38,022
- He's got tickets.
- Mmm.

314
00:23:38,023 --> 00:23:40,792
I like someone else now.

315
00:23:40,793 --> 00:23:42,293
Oh, who?

316
00:23:42,294 --> 00:23:44,596
- It's a secret.
- From me?

317
00:23:44,597 --> 00:23:47,065
He doesn't know yet.

318
00:23:47,066 --> 00:23:49,601
It's a little project I'm working on.

319
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:51,402
A project?
I like projects.

320
00:24:01,081 --> 00:24:03,515
Shh.

321
00:24:04,084 --> 00:24:06,385
It's okay.
It's okay.

322
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,680
Louise, are you free for lunch?

323
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:36,182
Oh, well, I was maybe
gonna have lunch with Ben,

324
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,717
but it wasn't definite.

325
00:24:37,718 --> 00:24:40,620
Let me give him a call
can I'll give you a call on email.

326
00:24:40,621 --> 00:24:42,055
- Okay, good.
- Okay? All right.

327
00:24:42,056 --> 00:24:44,991
Yeah, well, let's-

328
00:24:44,992 --> 00:24:46,993
Look, let Jerry defend him.
He's terrific.

329
00:24:46,994 --> 00:24:48,662
- Jerry?
- Yeah, and besides,

330
00:24:48,663 --> 00:24:50,664
he loves a good challenge.

331
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:53,099
Hang on.
It's my wife.

332
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,569
All right, guys,
we'll pick this up later.

333
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,538
- Hey, baby, what's shaking?
- Kiss my ass.

334
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,174
He doesn't see enough money in it.
Fucking Jew.

335
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:01,609
Are we on for lunch?

336
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,413
Oh, sweetie, I really wanted to,
but I can't get out of my lunch meeting.

337
00:25:05,414 --> 00:25:07,515
I thought for sure it was gonna cancel.
I'm sorry.

338
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:11,118
Oh, okay. Yeah, no problem.
I'll just see you tonight.

339
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:13,120
All right, I'll see you at home.
Bye bye.

340
00:25:13,121 --> 00:25:16,886
I love you.
Bye.

341
00:25:18,627 --> 00:25:20,394
Ben:
I'll tell you, what I'd really like to do

342
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:22,263
is just walk away
from the whole damn practice.

343
00:25:22,264 --> 00:25:24,765
- Man: Burned out, huh?
- No, you know what it actually is?

344
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:28,937
I'm sick of defending bad people
day in and day out.

345
00:25:28,938 --> 00:25:30,606
I mean, some of them
are really innocent,

346
00:25:30,607 --> 00:25:34,443
but the vast majority are scumbags.

347
00:25:34,444 --> 00:25:36,812
Killer walks free

348
00:25:36,813 --> 00:25:40,182
because I discovered that a cop
improperly labeled an evidence bag

349
00:25:40,183 --> 00:25:42,818
containing the bloody knife with
the guy's fingerprints all over it.

350
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:44,853
It's got to be thrown out.

351
00:25:44,854 --> 00:25:47,055
- You know?
- It's tough.

352
00:25:47,056 --> 00:25:49,358
Yeah.
I envy you.

353
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,895
Well, I mean, I'm in a whole
different category.

354
00:25:53,896 --> 00:25:58,101
The organizations I represent
fight for equal rights.

355
00:25:58,102 --> 00:26:00,603
You know, free speech.
Good causes, you know?

356
00:26:00,604 --> 00:26:03,072
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, when I win a case

357
00:26:03,073 --> 00:26:06,576
good decent people
get a better life.

358
00:26:06,577 --> 00:26:08,111
A fighting chance, you know?

359
00:26:08,112 --> 00:26:09,579
Hmm.

360
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,748
You should do
some pro bono for us.

361
00:26:11,749 --> 00:26:14,617
Might remind you why you
became a lawyer in the first place.

362
00:26:14,618 --> 00:26:17,487
Look, I do my share of pro bono.

363
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:19,422
I can't afford to do any more.

364
00:26:19,423 --> 00:26:21,090
Yeah.

365
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:24,527
It's funny. Having kids is what
completely shifted my values.

366
00:26:24,528 --> 00:26:26,262
You know?

367
00:26:26,263 --> 00:26:28,832
And I've got to keep the money
coming in now more than ever.

368
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,568
Lately, I hate what I'm doing,

369
00:26:31,569 --> 00:26:34,038
but I'm kind of stuck for a while.

370
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:37,408
Well, you know,
I hear that professionals

371
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:39,476
change their careers two to three
times in a lifetime.

372
00:26:39,477 --> 00:26:40,844
So do something else.

373
00:26:40,845 --> 00:26:43,074
Yeah, right.

374
00:26:46,084 --> 00:26:47,985
Want to get out of here?

375
00:26:47,986 --> 00:26:50,420
Yeah, let's do it.

376
00:27:39,706 --> 00:27:41,240
Hey, Stephanie.

377
00:27:41,241 --> 00:27:43,436
Hey, Marty.

378
00:27:44,711 --> 00:27:47,441
Let's see here.

379
00:27:48,048 --> 00:27:49,749
Mind if I join you?

380
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,810
Help yourself.

381
00:27:58,325 --> 00:28:01,158
Good old PB&J.

382
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,165
When I was little I used to put
potato chips right into the sandwich.

383
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:07,463
- You ever do that?
- Nope.

384
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:10,971
You know, more people
are allergic to peanuts

385
00:28:10,972 --> 00:28:13,707
than any other food.

386
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:16,109
I'm allergic to cats.

387
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,446
I had this girlfriend this one time,
she had four cats.

388
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,215
It was murder.

389
00:28:22,216 --> 00:28:24,417
You have any cats?

390
00:28:24,418 --> 00:28:26,408
Nope.

391
00:28:35,264 --> 00:28:37,561
Poor Marty.

392
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:43,704
What's with this crappy car?

393
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,477
You know, people are really crazy
for, like, little cat knickknacks

394
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:52,914
and, like, little, you know,
cat-related doodads.

395
00:28:52,915 --> 00:28:55,983
If you could figure out a way
to tap into that market,

396
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,952
you'd be laughing
all the way to the bank.

397
00:29:00,022 --> 00:29:01,924
I had an idea once for, like, a little-

398
00:29:01,925 --> 00:29:05,986
it was, like, a beverage, like, you know,
orange soda or grape soda or something.

399
00:29:06,963 --> 00:29:10,699
But it had a little car character on it

400
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,101
and it was called Catatonic.

401
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:17,335
You know, 'cause it-

402
00:29:20,643 --> 00:29:23,178
You know, I guess a lot of people

403
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:25,614
probably have really good ideas

404
00:29:25,615 --> 00:29:27,816
but the difference is

405
00:29:27,817 --> 00:29:29,685
distribution

406
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:32,451
and getting them out there,
you know?

407
00:29:33,858 --> 00:29:35,792
I have a funny joke for you.

408
00:29:35,793 --> 00:29:38,995
What did Catwoman's husband

409
00:29:38,996 --> 00:29:41,197
leave in the litter box for her?

410
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:43,996
Katmandu.

411
00:29:45,002 --> 00:29:47,629
Get it?
Like doo-doo.

412
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:54,811
- Hey, do you like movies?
- Nope.

413
00:29:54,812 --> 00:29:58,114
Oh, okay, yeah.
I didn't think so.

414
00:29:58,115 --> 00:30:00,850
Um, actually that's why
I was thinking instead

415
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:04,188
maybe sometime if you weren't-
if you were interested

416
00:30:04,189 --> 00:30:06,991
if you wanted to maybe,
like, get dinner or something,

417
00:30:06,992 --> 00:30:08,792
you know, somewhere

418
00:30:08,793 --> 00:30:11,328
just as, um, you know,
as an idea.

419
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:13,456
- Hey.
- Hey.

420
00:30:20,438 --> 00:30:22,872
Okay.

421
00:30:24,943 --> 00:30:27,138
Well.

422
00:30:32,952 --> 00:30:34,686
Okay, I'm shoving off.

423
00:30:34,687 --> 00:30:37,621
See you later, Marty.

424
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:42,227
My God, I can't believe
you guys just missed that.

425
00:30:42,228 --> 00:30:44,996
He just completely hit on me.
He asked me on a date.

426
00:30:44,997 --> 00:30:47,432
Farty Marty.

427
00:30:47,433 --> 00:30:49,868
Sherri:
Oh, hey, Mr. Krebbs.

428
00:30:49,869 --> 00:30:51,703
- Hey.
- Mr. Bates.

429
00:30:51,704 --> 00:30:53,972
Mr. Krebbs, thanks again

430
00:30:53,973 --> 00:30:55,907
for recommending
"Marjorie Morningstar. "

431
00:30:55,908 --> 00:30:58,610
- Oh yeah.
- I'm loving it. It's so romantic.

432
00:30:58,611 --> 00:31:00,979
I knew you were looking for
a good book and you want to be an actor

433
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,349
- so it seemed like a perfect fit. Hi.
- Hi.

434
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,251
It is.
I'm almost done.

435
00:31:05,252 --> 00:31:07,086
Good.

436
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:09,755
Well, see you.

437
00:31:09,756 --> 00:31:11,590
See you later.

438
00:31:11,591 --> 00:31:13,559
My God, did you see those nipples?

439
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,028
Look at those asses.
I think I'm gonna blow right now.

440
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:17,763
- Oh my God.
- Come on.

441
00:31:17,764 --> 00:31:20,232
Don't tell me you haven't thought about
bending these girls over a chair.

442
00:31:20,233 --> 00:31:22,568
- Do you know how old they are?
- My uncle once said it best:

443
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:24,804
If there's grass on the field,
play ball.

444
00:31:24,805 --> 00:31:27,006
- That your uncle that died in prison?
- Oh, that's very funny.

445
00:31:27,007 --> 00:31:31,010
Seriously, I'd like to fuck the
living shit outta that little bitch.

446
00:31:31,011 --> 00:31:32,545
Oh my God.

447
00:31:32,546 --> 00:31:36,016
You know, Barry, getting out
of high school,

448
00:31:36,017 --> 00:31:37,851
I've been around these
teenagers for decades.

449
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:39,486
They know exactly
what they're doing.

450
00:31:39,487 --> 00:31:42,155
- She was blatantly flirting with you.
- She was just being a kid.

451
00:31:42,156 --> 00:31:44,257
She wasn't flirting with me.

452
00:31:44,258 --> 00:31:47,194
They're highly sexualized.
Their hormones are raging.

453
00:31:47,195 --> 00:31:49,730
You don't think these kids
are having plenty of sex?

454
00:31:49,731 --> 00:31:51,298
- I don't know.
- Please.

455
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:53,133
They're like fucking rabbits.

456
00:31:53,134 --> 00:31:55,736
These little teenage geeks
they're fucking,

457
00:31:55,737 --> 00:31:58,338
they do not know
how lucky they got it right now.

458
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:00,507
One day they'll be old and paunchy

459
00:32:00,508 --> 00:32:03,778
and turning 50 and looking back
on how lucky they had it

460
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,713
and didn't appreciate it.
Kind of like you.

461
00:32:08,584 --> 00:32:11,951
- Well, see you.
- See you later.

462
00:32:12,788 --> 00:32:14,255
My God, did you
see those nipples?

463
00:32:14,256 --> 00:32:17,325
Working on a little
project, are we?

464
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:18,793
What do you mean?

465
00:32:18,794 --> 00:32:21,295
Please, Sherri,
I know you way too well.

466
00:32:21,296 --> 00:32:23,664
You want to fuck Mr. Krebbs.

467
00:32:23,665 --> 00:32:25,533
Perhaps.

468
00:32:25,534 --> 00:32:27,969
Sherri, you're crazy.

469
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,704
What?
He's kind of cute.

470
00:32:29,705 --> 00:32:31,706
Yeah, and his wife's
about to have a baby.

471
00:32:31,707 --> 00:32:34,977
Exactly.
He probably hasn't had sex in months.

472
00:32:34,978 --> 00:32:36,979
He's probably horny as shit.

473
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,471
Don't say anything to anyone.

474
00:32:40,216 --> 00:32:42,251
I won't.

475
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:44,686
Are you even reading
"Marjorie Morning Glory,"

476
00:32:44,687 --> 00:32:46,355
or whatever the fuck it's called?

477
00:32:46,356 --> 00:32:48,557
I read the back cover.

478
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:50,092
Oh God.

479
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,823
You are so pathetic.

480
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:11,548
¶¶ Opening a can or worms ¶¶

481
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:15,752

483
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:23,793
¶¶ Don't you dare throw them away ¶¶

484
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:27,697
¶¶ A harlot spikes the bowl ¶¶

485
00:33:27,698 --> 00:33:31,835
¶¶ With regurgitated brains ¶¶

486
00:33:31,836 --> 00:33:35,573
¶¶ We hide under
a broken rainbow ¶¶

487
00:33:35,574 --> 00:33:40,311
¶¶ Waiting for the rain to fade... ¶¶

488
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:42,413
¶¶ Hello, Megan ¶¶

489
00:33:42,414 --> 00:33:44,248
¶¶ Hello, monkey ¶¶

490
00:33:44,249 --> 00:33:46,283
¶¶ I love you, Megan ¶¶

491
00:33:46,284 --> 00:33:48,911
¶¶ I love you, monkey. ¶¶

492
00:33:55,193 --> 00:33:58,996
¶¶ Because déjà vu ¶¶

493
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:03,868
¶¶ It sounds like something not true ¶¶

494
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:06,972
¶¶ But I think ¶¶

495
00:34:06,973 --> 00:34:11,810
¶¶ That I have seen it with you ¶¶

496
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:14,980
¶¶ And I am sure ¶¶

497
00:34:14,981 --> 00:34:19,684
¶¶ I've never been here before ¶¶

498
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:23,155
¶¶ It's there at my door ¶¶

499
00:34:23,156 --> 00:34:27,559
¶¶ That is running on the floor ¶¶

500
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,362

00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:46,070
¶¶ We were high ¶¶

505
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:50,816
¶¶ And feeling no pain ¶¶

506

¶¶ With a hot beer on the red-eye. ¶¶

510
00:35:07,735 --> 00:35:10,204
Hey.

511
00:35:10,205 --> 00:35:12,072
- That was beautiful.
- Oh thanks, man.

512
00:35:12,073 --> 00:35:15,201
- Yeah, that's a good one, man.
- Thanks.

513
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:18,000
$8.13.

514
00:35:18,513 --> 00:35:20,814
- Just keep it.
- All right.

515
00:35:20,815 --> 00:35:23,840
- Thank you so much.
- Sure, right on, man.

516
00:35:26,154 --> 00:35:28,055
- Bye,
- All right, thanks.

517
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:30,319
- See you later.
- Bye.

518
00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:35,825
That'll work.

519
00:35:36,397 --> 00:35:39,567
Hey, man, I need
to borrow some money.

520
00:35:39,568 --> 00:35:41,703
You still owe me
fucking money, man.

521
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:44,672
I know. Look, I've got a ticket
that's gonna double

522
00:35:44,673 --> 00:35:46,541
tomorrow if I don't pay it.
Double.

523
00:35:46,542 --> 00:35:49,744
How'd you get a ticket, man?
You don't drive.

524
00:35:49,745 --> 00:35:51,379
Jaywalking.

525
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,081
Give me 50 bucks.

526
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:56,618
$50? Give me a break, Carl,
I can't, man.

527
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:59,687
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

528
00:35:59,688 --> 00:36:02,924
Carl, I can't. How much do you think
I make in this fucking dump?

529
00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:06,494
All right? I'm already letting you
eat that bullshit for free, man.

530
00:36:06,495 --> 00:36:08,764
If my boss found out
he'd fucking fire me.

531
00:36:08,765 --> 00:36:13,224
Just have your mom wire the fucking
money instead of sending a check.

532
00:36:21,778 --> 00:36:23,472
Hey.

533
00:36:24,214 --> 00:36:25,981
Hey.

534
00:36:25,982 --> 00:36:27,683
Uh-oh.

535
00:36:27,684 --> 00:36:29,818
Can we talk?

536
00:36:29,819 --> 00:36:31,887
I'm working.

537
00:36:31,888 --> 00:36:34,290
No, you know what?

538
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:35,891
I don't think that'd be
a good fucking idea.

539
00:36:35,892 --> 00:36:38,793
Please?
I miss you.

540
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,342
What the fuck are you doing here?

541
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,644
I just really miss you, okay?
I'm sorry.

542
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,546
Are you fucking kidding me?

543
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,348
What is this bullshit?

544
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,544
No, I want to get back together.

545
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:05,822
What- what about
fucking Arnondo,

546
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,891
or whatever
the fuck his name was?

547
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,393
I thought you guys
were going to Arizona.

548
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,692
It's Marco
and I came back.

549
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:17,368
Can you imagine for one fucking
second if I came up to you

550
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:20,371
and I said, "Hey, by the way,
we're breaking up

551
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:23,441
'cause I just met this
really unbelievable girl.

552
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:26,544
I never knew what love
was with you.

553
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:28,946
We can still be friends.

554
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:33,084
Oh, and you know, this girl is
an unbelievable flamenco dancer.

555
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:35,619
We're gonna put together
this fucking cabaret act

556
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,522
and go out to Arizona and dance
at her uncle's restaurant. "

557
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:39,925
Am I forgetting
any fucking shit?

558
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:41,860
Willie, stop it, okay?
I'm sorry.

559
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:43,929
I made a mistake, okay?

560
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:46,164
I made a horrible
horrible mistake.

561
00:37:46,165 --> 00:37:48,033
I'm only human.

562
00:37:48,034 --> 00:37:50,593
Can we just-

563
00:37:52,538 --> 00:37:55,273
Look, this ain't the place for this shit,
all right? I'm working, okay?

564
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:57,833
Can we talk somewhere else, please?

565
00:38:01,047 --> 00:38:03,572
- Please?
- Wait a fucking minute.

566
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:08,353
Watch the fucking store
for me for a minute, okay?

567
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:11,224
Don't do it, man.
That chick is bad news.

568
00:38:11,225 --> 00:38:12,959
I just need 10 or 15 minutes.

569
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,494
I'm gonna go next door
and have a cup of coffee.

570
00:38:14,495 --> 00:38:16,562
Just watch the fucking place.

571
00:38:16,563 --> 00:38:18,331
And what if a customer comes in?

572
00:38:18,332 --> 00:38:20,233
It's fucking dead at this hour, man.

573
00:38:20,234 --> 00:38:22,869
I don't know how
to work the register.

574
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:26,533
There's nothing to fucking work.
It's a computer with a laser.

575
00:38:27,408 --> 00:38:29,275
All right?

576
00:38:29,276 --> 00:38:31,411
Look, you see that?

577
00:38:31,412 --> 00:38:34,981
- That's a barcode.
- I know what a barcode is, dumbfuck.

578
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:37,950
Well, all you do
is scan it with the laser,

579
00:38:37,951 --> 00:38:40,587
the price pops up, all right?

580
00:38:40,588 --> 00:38:43,590
If they give you a five or a 10
or whatever they give you

581
00:38:43,591 --> 00:38:45,492
you just hit the number.
It's written, $5.

582
00:38:45,493 --> 00:38:47,661
You hit it.
All you do is hit sale.

583
00:38:47,662 --> 00:38:49,797
And it's- 806 is the code,
all right?

584
00:38:49,798 --> 00:38:52,633
Sale 806, it open-
it should open.

585
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:55,202
Escape.
If it doesn't open, hit escape.

586
00:38:55,203 --> 00:38:57,004
All right?

587
00:38:57,005 --> 00:38:59,873
It'll open.
It should fucking open.

588
00:38:59,874 --> 00:39:02,342
Just hit escape,
okay, if it doesn't open.

589
00:39:02,343 --> 00:39:04,578
They designed it so a fucking
monkey could work it, man.

590
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:05,946
It's nothing.

591
00:39:05,947 --> 00:39:07,915
Don't be a sap, man.

592
00:39:07,916 --> 00:39:11,753
Grow some fucking balls
and tell that chick to fuck off.

593
00:39:11,754 --> 00:39:13,955
Look, there's no way

594
00:39:13,956 --> 00:39:15,990
I'm taking this fucking bitch
back, man.

595
00:39:15,991 --> 00:39:19,358
Okay?
Just mind the store.

596
00:39:31,106 --> 00:39:33,041
Let me out!
Let me out!

597
00:39:41,618 --> 00:39:45,110
Hey, what about her?

598
00:39:45,922 --> 00:39:47,756
Someone will find her.

599
00:39:47,757 --> 00:39:50,088
Let's get out of here.

600
00:40:54,927 --> 00:40:57,061
Oh, don't come in here.

601
00:40:57,062 --> 00:41:00,326
Please don't come in here.

602
00:41:07,873 --> 00:41:10,341
Oh, fuck.

603
00:41:31,264 --> 00:41:33,391
Hey.

604
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,693
And a carton of Parliaments.

605
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,642
Uh, okay.
Will that be all, sir?

606
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:48,143
- Yeah.
- Okay.

607
00:41:48,782 --> 00:41:50,583
All right, then.

608
00:41:50,584 --> 00:41:52,885
Let me just put this

609
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:55,115
in a little baggie.

610
00:41:58,726 --> 00:42:00,893
The duct tape...

611
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:03,129
carton of Parliaments.

612
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,598
Okay, let's see.

613
00:42:17,012 --> 00:42:20,080
Just a sec.

614
00:42:30,191 --> 00:42:32,192
I'm growing a beard here, dude.

615
00:42:32,193 --> 00:42:34,684
I know.
These things are confusing.

616
00:42:36,898 --> 00:42:39,233
Carl:
Ay-yi-yi.

617
00:42:39,234 --> 00:42:41,068
- Let's go.
- I got it.

618
00:42:41,069 --> 00:42:42,970
Believe me, I'd like to.

619
00:42:42,971 --> 00:42:44,806
This guy must be new or something.

620
00:42:44,807 --> 00:42:47,809
Sorry, these things are tricky.
Very confusing.

621
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,544
Do you need a credit card?

622
00:42:49,545 --> 00:42:51,946
No no no, that would be worse.

623
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:53,415
What's the problem?

624
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:55,083
You know what?
Just take it.

625
00:42:55,084 --> 00:42:56,885
Just take it.

626
00:42:56,886 --> 00:42:58,486
What?

627
00:42:58,487 --> 00:43:01,923
This register is for shit.
Just take it. Take it, take it.

628
00:43:01,924 --> 00:43:04,358
No, man, no.
Look, here.

629
00:43:05,928 --> 00:43:09,625
Here's 40 bucks.
There's no way it's more than that.

630
00:43:10,533 --> 00:43:12,933
Keep the change, all right?

631
00:43:21,678 --> 00:43:24,442
What nice guys.

632
00:43:45,336 --> 00:43:48,371
- God!
- Oh my God, Mr. Krebbs.

633
00:43:48,372 --> 00:43:50,307
Oh, man.

634
00:43:50,308 --> 00:43:52,909
Sherri, what are you doing here?

635
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:56,079
My aunt lives here.
What are you doing here?

636
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,948
Well, I live here.

637
00:43:57,949 --> 00:44:00,717
Wow, what a coincidence.

638
00:44:00,718 --> 00:44:03,353
Do you always get home
this late from school?

639
00:44:03,354 --> 00:44:05,789
Uh, no.
I'm chairman of the book fair.

640
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:08,959
So a lot of organizing to do
these next few nights.

641
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,194
How's Mrs. Krebbs?

642
00:44:11,195 --> 00:44:13,396
She's so beautiful, by the way.

643
00:44:13,397 --> 00:44:14,865
Thank you.
No, she's good.

644
00:44:14,866 --> 00:44:16,534
She's good.
She's waiting for her pretzels.

645
00:44:16,535 --> 00:44:18,736
She's getting all those
cravings they talk about.

646
00:44:18,737 --> 00:44:21,272
You know, last month and all.

647
00:44:21,273 --> 00:44:24,675
So, um...
Yeah, anyway, I'm gonna go up-

648
00:44:24,676 --> 00:44:27,245
Um, I would love to get together

649
00:44:27,246 --> 00:44:29,873
and talk about the book sometime.

650
00:44:30,883 --> 00:44:32,450
Okay.

651
00:44:32,451 --> 00:44:34,519
Um...

652
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,487
Okay, well, um...

653
00:44:36,488 --> 00:44:38,122
we're gonna talk about
that in school, all right?

654
00:44:38,123 --> 00:44:40,024
And I'll see you tomorrow.

655
00:44:40,025 --> 00:44:42,823
Okay.

656
00:45:33,047 --> 00:45:34,781
Bad move, man.

657
00:45:34,782 --> 00:45:36,983
Shut up.
Any customers?

658
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,815
Nope.

659
00:45:41,422 --> 00:45:43,423
What the fuck is shit shit, man?

660
00:45:43,424 --> 00:45:46,092
God damn, Carl.

661
00:45:46,093 --> 00:45:48,429
Fucking pig, man.

662
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:51,228
Get on the other side of the counter.

663
00:45:51,967 --> 00:45:54,001
Motherfucker.

664
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:56,604
I can't believe you're such a pussy.

665
00:45:56,605 --> 00:45:59,473
Look who's fucking talking.

666
00:45:59,474 --> 00:46:03,244
You practically stalked Lucy
for the past five fucking years, man.

667
00:46:03,245 --> 00:46:05,212
No.

668
00:46:05,213 --> 00:46:06,814
We became friends.

669
00:46:06,815 --> 00:46:09,149
You're telling me that you
wouldn't go back with her?

670
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,651
No, I wouldn't.

671
00:46:10,652 --> 00:46:12,286
Well, would you fuck her?

672
00:46:12,287 --> 00:46:14,421
Yes, but that's different.

673
00:46:14,422 --> 00:46:16,323
Oh, different my fucking ass, man.

674
00:46:16,324 --> 00:46:19,594
Look, I ain't gonna play this whole
macho posturing bullshit.

675
00:46:19,595 --> 00:46:22,297
I can get past
the whole Arnondo thing.

676
00:46:22,298 --> 00:46:24,032
You know why?

677
00:46:24,033 --> 00:46:26,831
Because fucking love
is bigger than one little mistake.

678
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:31,139
Marco.
His name is Marco.

679
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,874
Whatever, man.
Fuck you.

680
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,442
Olé!

681
00:46:34,443 --> 00:46:37,707
Olé olé olé.

682
00:46:37,947 --> 00:46:41,016
Help me!

683
00:46:43,286 --> 00:46:45,686
I'm in here!

684
00:47:00,137 --> 00:47:03,572
Man on P.A.:
Tony, please pick up extension 2-5.

685
00:47:04,675 --> 00:47:07,575
Tony Gilbert, extension 2-5.

686
00:47:08,645 --> 00:47:10,746
Tony, 2-5, please.

687
00:47:10,747 --> 00:47:13,408
This is Tony.

688
00:47:14,384 --> 00:47:16,919
Nope, in the back.

689
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,855
Yeah.

690
00:47:18,856 --> 00:47:21,024
Well, what was the word
of the day, Michael?

691
00:47:21,025 --> 00:47:23,126
No no no, the word of the day
was initiative.

692
00:47:23,127 --> 00:47:25,322
Take some.
Find it yourself.

693
00:47:30,868 --> 00:47:33,393
Tell me when.

694
00:48:07,906 --> 00:48:09,640
Hey, sweetie,
you gonna play leapfrog

695
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:11,609
with the ladybug and the frog?

696
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:14,379
- All right.
- It's hard.

697
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,246
You can do it.
Jump back and forth and play leapfrog.

698
00:48:18,917 --> 00:48:20,953
All right.
Good job.

699
00:48:20,954 --> 00:48:23,547
That was good.

700
00:48:41,941 --> 00:48:43,642
Krebbs:
What, are you stalking me or what?

701
00:48:43,643 --> 00:48:47,146
- You would like that, wouldn't you?
- No, I would not.

702
00:48:47,147 --> 00:48:49,616
No, I like to come here on Sundays

703
00:48:49,617 --> 00:48:53,053
and have my iced coffee,
read the paper.

704
00:48:53,054 --> 00:48:55,555
Really?
I've never seen you here on a Sunday,

705
00:48:55,556 --> 00:48:58,558
It's my new tradition.

706
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,727
What are you writing?

707
00:49:00,728 --> 00:49:02,695
I am writing a screenplay.

708
00:49:02,696 --> 00:49:04,631
- Wow.
- Yeah.

709
00:49:04,632 --> 00:49:06,766
I didn't know you wrote screenplays.

710
00:49:06,767 --> 00:49:08,301
You wouldn't.
Nobody knows.

711
00:49:08,302 --> 00:49:11,704
I write them and nobody buys them,
so why would you know?

712
00:49:11,705 --> 00:49:15,041
Um, so what's it about?

713
00:49:15,042 --> 00:49:18,845
Uh, it's a supernatural
political thriller.

714
00:49:18,846 --> 00:49:20,981
Wow.

715
00:49:20,982 --> 00:49:23,050
- Okay, tell me.
- Yeah?

716
00:49:23,051 --> 00:49:25,152
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

717
00:49:31,226 --> 00:49:34,328
Wow, that sounds complicated.

718
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:36,330
It does, doesn't it?

719
00:49:36,331 --> 00:49:38,399
Yeah, it takes
a little bit of research,

720
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,401
but I like the political stuff.

721
00:49:40,402 --> 00:49:43,037
Oh, me too.

722
00:49:43,038 --> 00:49:45,039
- I love politics.
- Yeah?

723
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,908
I watch CNN all the time.

724
00:49:47,909 --> 00:49:50,640
Oh boy.

725
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:12,701
I want a hot dog.
I want a hot dog.

726
00:50:12,702 --> 00:50:15,170
- I want a hot dog.
- No.

727
00:50:15,171 --> 00:50:17,873
No hot dogs.
We eat healthy in this family.

728
00:50:17,874 --> 00:50:19,841
All right, who wants what?

729
00:50:19,842 --> 00:50:21,944
- I want a hot dog.
- No.

730
00:50:21,945 --> 00:50:23,880
Let her have a hot dog.
It's Sunday.

731
00:50:23,881 --> 00:50:25,548
- Ben!
- I want one too.

732
00:50:25,549 --> 00:50:29,185
- I want a hot dog.
- Fine. Fine.

733
00:50:29,186 --> 00:50:32,822
God, all right. I'll have a chicken
Caesar and an iced tea, all right?

734
00:50:32,823 --> 00:50:34,423
- All right.
- Are you happy now?

735
00:50:34,424 --> 00:50:37,360
- One hotdog for you.
- Plain with catsup too.

736
00:50:37,361 --> 00:50:38,919
With catsup.
One for me.

737
00:50:39,396 --> 00:50:41,464
A chicken Caesar
and an iced tea for Mommy,

738
00:50:41,465 --> 00:50:44,200
And one barbequed beef
sandwich for him.

739
00:50:44,201 --> 00:50:46,536
- Be right back.
- How can he eat that?

740
00:50:46,537 --> 00:50:50,139
- Ben.
- George, what are you doing here?

741
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,876
- I'm just coming from the gym.
- Really?

742
00:50:52,877 --> 00:50:55,145
- Hi, George Higgins.
- Hi.

743
00:50:55,146 --> 00:50:57,447
George, this is my wife Louise.

744
00:50:57,448 --> 00:50:59,082
- This is my daughter Megan.
- Hi.

745
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:00,284
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

746
00:51:00,285 --> 00:51:02,219
And that little larval human
over there is Josh.

747
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,788
You have a cute little family here.

748
00:51:04,789 --> 00:51:06,390
Thank you.

749
00:51:06,391 --> 00:51:08,625
Well, I'll let you get back to
doing what you were doing.

750
00:51:08,626 --> 00:51:11,228
So see you around the campus?

751
00:51:11,229 --> 00:51:13,430
- All right, take care, George.
- Bye.

752
00:51:13,431 --> 00:51:15,455
- Take care.
- Bye.

753
00:51:16,434 --> 00:51:19,436
- How do you know him?
- I see him around the courthouse.

754
00:51:19,437 --> 00:51:21,772
He works for one of those
civil liberties groups.

755
00:51:21,773 --> 00:51:24,776
Mommy,
since I'm having vegetables

756
00:51:24,777 --> 00:51:27,312
can't I have some ice cream?

757
00:51:27,313 --> 00:51:29,247
I don't think so.

758
00:51:29,248 --> 00:51:32,383
You know what?
He seems a little G-A-Y to me.

759
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:34,152
- You think?
- Yeah.

760
00:51:34,153 --> 00:51:36,087
- All right, I'll be right back.
- Just kidding.

761
00:51:36,088 --> 00:51:38,954
- You are so cute.
- I'm not even having vegetables.

762
00:51:39,858 --> 00:51:42,223
Be right back.

763
00:51:42,795 --> 00:51:45,029
Well, let's see
if you eat all your dinner.

764
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,765
And if you do, we'll think about
ice cream. How about that?

765
00:51:47,766 --> 00:51:49,100
Okay.

766
00:51:49,101 --> 00:51:50,969
So where is Mrs. Krebbs?

767
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:53,564
She's asleep.
She's taking a nap.

768
00:51:54,641 --> 00:51:56,175
You guys are a cute couple.

769
00:51:56,176 --> 00:51:58,644
How long have you been together?

770
00:51:58,645 --> 00:52:02,147
Been together seven years.
Been married for two.

771
00:52:02,148 --> 00:52:04,083
Wow.

772
00:52:04,084 --> 00:52:06,452
- Seven years?
- Seven years.

773
00:52:06,453 --> 00:52:10,252
That's a long time to only have sex
with one person.

774
00:52:11,157 --> 00:52:13,425
Excuse me?

775
00:52:13,426 --> 00:52:15,828
I'm sorry, Mr. Krebbs.

776
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:18,497
I'm just saying that seven years
with no variety...

777
00:52:18,498 --> 00:52:21,533
I mean, I know how guys are.

778
00:52:21,534 --> 00:52:23,169
I assure you I'm not a guy, okay?

779
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:24,771
I'm- I'm your teacher.

780
00:52:24,772 --> 00:52:27,674
I know you're my teacher.

781
00:52:27,675 --> 00:52:30,310
But last time I-

782
00:52:30,311 --> 00:52:32,846
- I checked...
- Mm-hmm.

783
00:52:32,847 --> 00:52:36,583
You're a guy too.
A very cute guy, I might add.

784
00:52:36,584 --> 00:52:38,785
Thank you.
Thank you for the compliment.

785
00:52:38,786 --> 00:52:40,620
I really appreciate that,
but I think...

786
00:52:40,621 --> 00:52:43,256
I'm gonna go on that note.
Okey-doke?

787
00:52:43,257 --> 00:52:46,126
So why don't we just
leave it there, okay?

788
00:52:46,127 --> 00:52:49,029
I've got all my stuff.
Thank you.

789
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:50,730
- I'll see-
- Um...

790
00:52:50,731 --> 00:52:53,666
You can't blame a girl for trying.

791
00:52:55,137 --> 00:52:57,696
See you in class.

792
00:52:58,974 --> 00:53:01,442
Woman:
There is somebody that works here

793
00:53:01,443 --> 00:53:03,678
who I thought maybe
I'd have a future with.

794
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:06,580
Ooh, do tell.

795
00:53:06,581 --> 00:53:08,416
Wait, is it that cute kid in shipping?

796
00:53:08,417 --> 00:53:10,651
What's his name?
Doug?

797
00:53:10,652 --> 00:53:12,386
No.

798
00:53:12,387 --> 00:53:14,411
He's a manager.

799
00:53:15,524 --> 00:53:17,458
Really?

800
00:53:17,459 --> 00:53:19,790
Who is it?

801
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:23,864
If I tell you you have to swear
not to tell a soul.

802
00:53:23,865 --> 00:53:26,868
He swore me to secrecy
and said we'd both get fired.

803
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:28,670
Scout's honor.

804
00:53:28,671 --> 00:53:30,706
Okay.

805
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:34,301
It's Tony Gilbert.
Do you know him?

806
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,986
Marian, will you call the New York
stores, see if they have her size?

807
00:53:44,987 --> 00:53:47,756
Hey, Tony, can I see you in the storeroom
about that inventory problem?

808
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:49,524
Oh, that's right.
Yeah.

809
00:53:49,525 --> 00:53:52,289
- Marian, you got this covered?
- Yes.

810
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:58,134
Come here.
I was so horny I was-

811
00:53:58,135 --> 00:54:00,470
Ow!
What the hell was that for?

812
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:03,373
- For Naomi, you asshole.
- Who's Naomi?

813
00:54:03,374 --> 00:54:05,908
You creep!
You don't even know who you sleep with.

814
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,010
The part-time girl in junior wear.

815
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:10,146
Oh, "Niomi. "

816
00:54:10,147 --> 00:54:12,215
What are you jealous about?

817
00:54:12,216 --> 00:54:13,649
No, I'm not jealous.
I'm angry.

818
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,618
How many other girls are you
boinking in dark corners?

819
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:19,611
None, I swear.
It was a one-time thing.

820
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,692
Why am I even lying to you?

821
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:24,660
Yeah, I screw around with
some of the girls, big deal.

822
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:27,431
- You're married with three kids.
- That's besides the point.

823
00:54:27,432 --> 00:54:29,032
What, are you gonna
leave your husband for me?

824
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:30,501
- No, but-
- Lydia, let's be honest here.

825
00:54:30,502 --> 00:54:32,503
We're both adults
having a little fun, right?

826
00:54:32,504 --> 00:54:35,905
I mean, I'm having fun.
I hope you're having fun.

827
00:54:36,408 --> 00:54:39,743
Frankly, you're more fun
than any of them.

828
00:54:39,744 --> 00:54:41,912
Oh, don't start doing
that thing with me.

829
00:54:41,913 --> 00:54:43,514
- What thing?
- That Tony thing.

830
00:54:43,515 --> 00:54:46,784
I'm not doing a Tony thing.
I'm being straight with you.

831
00:54:46,785 --> 00:54:49,686
Look, I don't drink, I don't smoke
and I don't do drugs.

832
00:54:49,687 --> 00:54:52,790
But everyone's got to have a vice.
So my vice is pretty girls.

833
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:55,693
But frankly, you know,

834
00:54:55,694 --> 00:54:57,729
you're different
than the other ones.

835
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:59,731
- Oh, please.
- No, I swear to God, you're sexier.

836
00:54:59,732 --> 00:55:02,667
There's something- like Naomi,
she's just like a girl.

837
00:55:02,668 --> 00:55:05,568
But there's something about you-
you're like a woman.

838
00:55:07,473 --> 00:55:09,774
For instance,
like, look at those boobs.

839
00:55:09,775 --> 00:55:12,577
I'm getting turned on just standing
here arguing with you.

840
00:55:12,578 --> 00:55:14,479
- You know what I'm saying?
- You're always turned on.

841
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,481
You're a walking hard-on.

842
00:55:16,482 --> 00:55:18,249
Just feel that.
You feel that?

843
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,151
Okay...

844
00:55:20,152 --> 00:55:22,153
Tony, stop.

845
00:55:22,154 --> 00:55:24,222
- I'm supposed to be mad at you.
- Good, be mad.

846
00:55:24,223 --> 00:55:27,526
Angry sex is good sex.
I'll get angry too.

847
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:29,995
I'll think about social injustice

848
00:55:29,996 --> 00:55:33,299
and how the Cubs can't win.

849
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,100
And the rainforest.

850
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:37,503
You know, you are out of your mind.

851
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:39,767
Come here, help me off
with these pants.

852
00:56:51,146 --> 00:56:53,381
Let's go. Daddy's probably
waiting for us by now.

853
00:56:53,382 --> 00:56:56,017
- I want this kitty.
- Next time, sweetheart.

854
00:56:56,018 --> 00:56:58,687
- Please.
- You have enough of them.

855
00:56:58,688 --> 00:57:01,918
- Some other time.
- Mom, I need it.

856
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,764
Hey, buddy.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

857
00:57:41,765 --> 00:57:43,866
My deposition ran long.

858
00:57:43,867 --> 00:57:45,468
No problem.

859
00:57:45,469 --> 00:57:49,639
And thank you for playing it cool
at the mall.

860
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,541
Of course.

861
00:57:51,542 --> 00:57:53,843
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

862
00:57:53,844 --> 00:57:55,612
I know what I want.
You know what you want?

863
00:57:55,613 --> 00:57:58,582
Kobe burger-

864
00:58:01,553 --> 00:58:03,486
I can't do this anymore.

865
00:58:04,489 --> 00:58:07,358
This is out of the blue.
Why?

866
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,020
Out of the blue?

867
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:13,497
I saw you with your family, man.

868
00:58:13,498 --> 00:58:16,333
I saw how happy you were.
They're beautiful.

869
00:58:16,334 --> 00:58:19,826
You're never gonna leave them
and I don't expect you to.

870
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:26,043
Look, I didn't expect to have these
feelings for you, but I do.

871
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:29,014
It hit me-
I need someone for me.

872
00:58:29,015 --> 00:58:31,182
I'm not gonna share you.

873
00:58:31,183 --> 00:58:34,311
I can't do this anymore.

874
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:40,792
Well, that's all well and good
and I understand that

875
00:58:40,793 --> 00:58:43,395
but we just don't cover acts of God

876
00:58:43,396 --> 00:58:46,197
in our insurance policy.

877
00:58:46,198 --> 00:58:49,034
If you actually reread your
homeowner's contract,

878
00:58:49,035 --> 00:58:51,002
and I can actually read to you

879
00:58:51,003 --> 00:58:53,733
from our manual and handbook-

880
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,081
I'm sorry.

881
00:59:02,082 --> 00:59:04,049
Can I call you back?

882
00:59:05,752 --> 00:59:07,753
It's really funny every time.

883
00:59:07,754 --> 00:59:10,356
Sour cream in my desk drawer-

884
00:59:10,357 --> 00:59:12,491
that's just brilliant.
That's hilarious.

885
00:59:12,492 --> 00:59:14,627
Sour cre-
who would do a thing like that?

886
00:59:14,628 --> 00:59:16,829
That is a perfectly
good waste of sour cream.

887
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:20,032
You know, I get it.
I'm the joke around here, okay?

888
00:59:20,033 --> 00:59:23,002
Everybody loves to pick on me.
I'm the nerd, okay?

889
00:59:23,003 --> 00:59:25,604
Let's mess with Marty's car.

890
00:59:25,605 --> 00:59:28,774
Let's lock him in
that locker all weekend.

891
00:59:28,775 --> 00:59:32,677
Let's pull his pants down
in the middle of gym class.

892
00:59:33,381 --> 00:59:36,349
Congratulations, Stuart.
You win, okay?

893
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:38,385
You know, out of all the people

894
00:59:38,386 --> 00:59:41,488
that have humiliated me
and bullied me

895
00:59:41,489 --> 00:59:43,056
you win, okay?

896
00:59:43,057 --> 00:59:46,026
Because your pranks
are the most creative

897
00:59:46,027 --> 00:59:48,061
and the most outrageous

898
00:59:48,062 --> 00:59:52,065
and the most- the most hilarious
for everybody, okay?

899
00:59:52,066 --> 00:59:55,402
So I hope you
are proud of yourself.

900
00:59:55,403 --> 00:59:57,803
Jerk!

901
01:00:00,509 --> 01:00:02,243
- Nice job.
- Yeah.

902
01:00:02,244 --> 01:00:04,609
That brought up some issues.

903
01:00:31,107 --> 01:00:33,475
Working late
on the book fair again?

904
01:00:33,476 --> 01:00:35,744
Sherri.

905
01:00:35,745 --> 01:00:37,813
Barry.

906
01:00:37,814 --> 01:00:39,948
Mr. Krebbs.

907
01:00:39,949 --> 01:00:43,885
Is that what you want me to
call you when you're fucking me?

908
01:00:45,255 --> 01:00:47,484
I think you should
go home now, Sherri.

909
01:00:48,591 --> 01:00:51,685
I don't suppose you
could give me a ride.

910
01:00:53,897 --> 01:00:56,024
Isn't that your car right there?

911
01:00:58,434 --> 01:01:00,925
It won't start.

912
01:01:17,588 --> 01:01:19,851
Get in.

913
01:02:00,565 --> 01:02:05,503
My, what a big cock you have,
Mr. Krebbs.

914
01:03:24,152 --> 01:03:27,280
Sherri:
I'll see you in class.

915
01:03:49,979 --> 01:03:52,313
Holly?

916
01:03:52,314 --> 01:03:55,616
I just fucked Mr. Krebbs.

917
01:03:55,617 --> 01:03:57,852
In the school parking lot.

918
01:03:57,853 --> 01:04:00,989
Meet me at Denny's immediately.

919
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:08,359
Hey-o, I'm back.

920
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:11,429
I'm sorry, I checked the whole storeroom
and we are completely out.

921
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:13,397
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry about that.

922
01:05:13,398 --> 01:05:15,232
We can order some.

923
01:05:15,233 --> 01:05:17,168
Go on the internet,
get some online maybe.

924
01:05:17,169 --> 01:05:19,003
No, that's okay.
Thank you.

925
01:05:19,004 --> 01:05:22,106
No problem. If you need help with anything
else, you know where to find us.

926
01:05:22,107 --> 01:05:24,199
- Okay, great.
- Okay.

927
01:05:26,044 --> 01:05:28,679
Courtney, you are doing
a fantastic job, by the way.

928
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,148
I mean really great. Are you sure
you haven't worked retail before?

929
01:05:31,149 --> 01:05:34,618
I suppose I do if you count selling
doughnuts in high school.

930
01:05:34,619 --> 01:05:37,355
I absolutely count selling doughnuts.

931
01:05:37,356 --> 01:05:40,292
You just have a great way
with the customers, you know?

932
01:05:40,293 --> 01:05:42,694
They really like you.

933
01:05:42,695 --> 01:05:44,526
Thanks.

934
01:05:48,668 --> 01:05:51,269
It's easy to see why.

935
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:53,431
Thanks.

936
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,233
Want to see my balls?

937
01:05:59,512 --> 01:06:01,546
Here they are.
Bath balls.

938
01:06:01,547 --> 01:06:03,215
You know, you put them in the bathtub
and they fizz

939
01:06:03,216 --> 01:06:05,150
and release oils and perfumes.

940
01:06:05,151 --> 01:06:07,120
You always smell really nice,
by the way.

941
01:06:07,121 --> 01:06:09,055
Do you take a lot of baths?

942
01:06:09,056 --> 01:06:11,824
I know perfectly well
what bath bombs are.

943
01:06:11,825 --> 01:06:13,893
Mr. Gilbert-

944
01:06:13,894 --> 01:06:16,429
- Tony.
- Mr. Gilbert.

945
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:19,565
I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your hands
and your innuendoes to yourself.

946
01:06:19,566 --> 01:06:22,602
Come on, don't be such
a stick-in-the-mud.

947
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:25,138
I'm just a touchy-feely
kind of guy, you know?

948
01:06:25,139 --> 01:06:27,240
And besides, there hasn't
been a girl this pretty

949
01:06:27,241 --> 01:06:30,243
who's worked here in, like, ever.

950
01:06:30,244 --> 01:06:33,679
Sometimes Little Tony takes over before
Big Tony knows what's going on.

951
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,882
Do you have, like,
any tattoos or anything?

952
01:06:35,883 --> 01:06:38,085
Well, tell Little Tony
I think he should know

953
01:06:38,086 --> 01:06:40,988
I had to sue my previous employer
for sexual harassment.

954
01:06:40,989 --> 01:06:43,023
It was a long drawn out process,

955
01:06:43,024 --> 01:06:45,526
that was really embarrassing
for all of us.

956
01:06:45,527 --> 01:06:48,495
I'd hate to put myself or anyone else
through that again.

957
01:06:48,496 --> 01:06:50,564
Really?

958
01:06:50,565 --> 01:06:52,794
Really.

959
01:06:53,434 --> 01:06:55,669
Well, uh, Courtney,

960
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:57,638
if I crossed
any line, I apologize.

961
01:06:57,639 --> 01:06:59,406
Just trying to be friendly.

962
01:06:59,407 --> 01:07:01,074
Well, I'm not here to make friends.

963
01:07:01,075 --> 01:07:02,876
I'm just here to do my job.

964
01:07:02,877 --> 01:07:06,642
So if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go help some customers.

965
01:07:20,029 --> 01:07:21,763
Barry.

966
01:07:21,764 --> 01:07:23,898
- Hey, Dennis.
- Hey, wait up.

967
01:07:23,899 --> 01:07:25,967
I've been looking for you.

968
01:07:25,968 --> 01:07:29,037
Come here.
I've got to talk to you.

969
01:07:29,038 --> 01:07:30,772
What's up?

970
01:07:30,773 --> 01:07:33,308
You fuck Sherri Van Hafton?

971
01:07:33,309 --> 01:07:35,674
What?

972
01:07:36,779 --> 01:07:39,441
It's a pretty simple question.
Did you fuck Sherri Van Hafton?

973
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:42,585
No, absolutely not.

974
01:07:42,586 --> 01:07:44,453
Why?

975
01:07:44,454 --> 01:07:47,122
Look, I'm not saying
I'd blame you if you did.

976
01:07:47,123 --> 01:07:50,726
I'd give my left nut to get some
of that stink on my pinkie,

977
01:07:50,727 --> 01:07:53,462
but kids are talking

978
01:07:53,463 --> 01:07:56,557
and word is that you did.

979
01:07:58,235 --> 01:08:00,236
All right, well, I didn't, okay?

980
01:08:00,237 --> 01:08:02,671
Barry.

981
01:08:03,607 --> 01:08:05,274
It's me.
Just be honest.

982
01:08:05,275 --> 01:08:07,640
I don't care.
I'm just curious.

983
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,815
It's true, isn't it?

984
01:08:11,816 --> 01:08:15,352
No, it's 100% not true.

985
01:08:15,353 --> 01:08:16,920
Okay?

986
01:08:16,921 --> 01:08:19,155
Well, if it's not true,
that's too bad.

987
01:08:19,156 --> 01:08:21,024
I was gonna ask you
if I could smell your fingers.

988
01:08:22,927 --> 01:08:24,628
But if it is true-

989
01:08:24,629 --> 01:08:26,796
I'm just saying if-

990
01:08:26,797 --> 01:08:29,733
lie about it.
Lie about it no matter what she says.

991
01:08:29,734 --> 01:08:33,103
I mean, ultimately it's just
her word against yours.

992
01:08:50,055 --> 01:08:52,455
Fucking asshole.

993
01:08:54,893 --> 01:08:57,795
Megan:
Norman threw up on the slide today

994
01:08:57,796 --> 01:09:00,398
and it went all the way down.

995
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:02,300
He did? Ew.

996
01:09:02,301 --> 01:09:04,826
And then Buddy Miller...

997
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:15,080
Mom, what are we
gonna do after this?

998
01:09:15,081 --> 01:09:19,117
After- well, I have to buy my dress
for tomorrow night.

999
01:09:19,118 --> 01:09:20,919
Can you buy me a dress too?

1000
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,155
We'll see.

1001
01:09:23,156 --> 01:09:25,824
Maybe- well, I do need
to get a dress for you

1002
01:09:25,825 --> 01:09:28,694
for Carrie's birthday party.

1003
01:09:28,695 --> 01:09:32,164
Can it not have a bow on it?

1004
01:09:32,165 --> 01:09:34,533
No, it doesn't have
to have a bow on it.

1005
01:09:34,534 --> 01:09:36,335
You should have seen his face.

1006
01:09:36,336 --> 01:09:38,570
What did you say?
What did you say?

1007
01:09:38,571 --> 01:09:40,006
Exactly what you told me to say.

1008
01:09:40,007 --> 01:09:42,241
Oh my God,
He must have totally freaked out.

1009
01:09:42,242 --> 01:09:44,377
What I would have given to
have been a fly on the wall.

1010
01:09:44,378 --> 01:09:45,878
You were so right.

1011
01:09:45,879 --> 01:09:48,281
First of all, the second
we were alone he started.

1012
01:09:48,282 --> 01:09:50,016
And just shameless.

1013
01:09:50,017 --> 01:09:52,285
See, I told you. The second you
got hired I knew you'd be next.

1014
01:09:52,286 --> 01:09:54,387
When he tried that
Casanova shit on me

1015
01:09:54,388 --> 01:09:55,888
I told him, "You touch me again,

1016
01:09:55,889 --> 01:09:58,358
I'm gonna sic my 300-Ib husband
on your bony ass. "

1017
01:09:58,359 --> 01:10:00,059
And what does
Little Tony think of that?

1018
01:10:01,528 --> 01:10:04,297
Do you think any girls here
have actually slept with him?

1019
01:10:04,298 --> 01:10:05,898
Oh, I don't know.

1020
01:10:05,899 --> 01:10:08,368
Only the stupid ones,
I would think.

1021
01:10:08,369 --> 01:10:11,600
Well, nice work, sister.

1022
01:10:26,154 --> 01:10:28,789
Mr. Krebbs, can I see you
for a minute please?

1023
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:30,491
Krebbs:
Yeah, sure.

1024
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:33,527
Guys, just start the next chapter
in the book, okay, please?

1025
01:10:33,528 --> 01:10:35,829
Thank you.
What's going on?

1026
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:38,432
What happened?
Is my wife okay?

1027
01:10:38,433 --> 01:10:40,334
- Barry Krebbs?
- Yeah?

1028
01:10:40,335 --> 01:10:43,071
You're under arrest for sexual assault
and rape of a minor.

1029
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,806
What? Rape?

1030
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:46,541
I didn't rape-
what are you talking about?

1031
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:48,510
- I didn't rape- this is a mistake.
- Barry, just-

1032
01:10:48,511 --> 01:10:50,845
- Bill, I didn't rape anyone.
- Barry, just do what they say.

1033
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:53,348
You have the right to remain silent.
If you refuse that right,

1034
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:56,117
anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

1035
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:57,719
You have the right to an attorney.

1036
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:00,211
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided to you.

1037
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:03,825
Do you understand these rights
as I've explained them to you?

1038
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:06,226
Yes.

1039
01:12:38,724 --> 01:12:42,326
Sir, there was a Middle-Eastern
guy onboard before.

1040
01:12:42,327 --> 01:12:45,163
I didn't see him get off,
but he left his knapsack on here

1041
01:12:45,164 --> 01:12:47,461
and it looks kind of suspicious.

1042
01:12:55,608 --> 01:12:57,973
Driver:
Get off the bus now.

1043
01:12:58,878 --> 01:13:01,446
Now, go go go.
Off the bus.

1044
01:13:01,447 --> 01:13:04,249
Step away from the bus.

1045
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:05,717
Step away from the bus now.

1046
01:13:05,718 --> 01:13:09,421
He had always been really nice
to all the kids at school.

1047
01:13:09,422 --> 01:13:12,024
Always helped us with our problems.

1048
01:13:12,025 --> 01:13:15,428
So when he asked me to stay after
school and help with the book fair

1049
01:13:15,429 --> 01:13:19,763
I was happy to help.

1050
01:13:20,935 --> 01:13:23,699
But when we got to his car...

1051
01:13:24,471 --> 01:13:26,773
that's when it happened.

1052
01:13:26,774 --> 01:13:29,042
He just came up behind me

1053
01:13:29,043 --> 01:13:31,744
and pushed himself against me.

1054
01:13:31,745 --> 01:13:34,280
Woman:
Does she have to relive every detail?

1055
01:13:34,281 --> 01:13:36,282
Ma'am, please.

1056
01:13:36,283 --> 01:13:39,185
And then he started saying
how sexy I was

1057
01:13:39,186 --> 01:13:41,711
and how he wanted...

1058
01:13:43,157 --> 01:13:45,559
to F me.

1059
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:48,796
I told Mr. Krebbs how
inappropriate this was

1060
01:13:48,797 --> 01:13:52,198
and that I was a virgin.

1061
01:13:54,035 --> 01:13:57,338
And then he just got
this wild look in his eyes

1062
01:13:57,339 --> 01:13:59,940
and he told me
how bad I wanted it

1063
01:13:59,941 --> 01:14:01,642
and just shoved me in the car.

1064
01:14:01,643 --> 01:14:04,478
He pulled out his...

1065
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:07,281
- you know.
- His penis?

1066
01:14:07,282 --> 01:14:08,983
Yes.

1067
01:14:08,984 --> 01:14:11,652
And he shoved it in my mouth.

1068
01:14:11,653 --> 01:14:13,087
Woman:
Oh my God.

1069
01:14:13,088 --> 01:14:15,090
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I tried to get out.

1070
01:14:15,091 --> 01:14:17,125
He just kept pulling me back in.

1071
01:14:17,126 --> 01:14:19,260
You have nothing to be
sorry for, sweetheart.

1072
01:14:19,261 --> 01:14:22,321
He pulled down my underpants...

1073
01:14:22,898 --> 01:14:26,799
and he shoved himself inside of me.

1074
01:14:27,436 --> 01:14:31,006
And I just kept saying no.

1075
01:14:31,007 --> 01:14:34,237
No no.

1076
01:14:36,145 --> 01:14:40,081
But he just kept going.

1077
01:14:44,821 --> 01:14:48,224
And then he told me if I ever
told anybody about this

1078
01:14:48,225 --> 01:14:51,125
he would kill me.

1079
01:14:52,562 --> 01:14:54,764
Then he threw me out of the car

1080
01:14:54,765 --> 01:14:57,563
and drove away.

1081
01:15:02,472 --> 01:15:04,735
Right, okay.

1082
01:15:06,276 --> 01:15:08,177
And these events,

1083
01:15:08,178 --> 01:15:11,280
they happened exactly as you
described them right here?

1084
01:15:11,281 --> 01:15:14,215
Yes.

1085
01:15:24,696 --> 01:15:26,925
Don't.

1086
01:15:31,869 --> 01:15:33,704
It's all a huge lie.

1087
01:15:33,705 --> 01:15:36,039
It's just-

1088
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:39,304
teenagers are crazy.
They're emotional unstable.

1089
01:15:40,378 --> 01:15:41,978
I mean, it's-

1090
01:15:41,979 --> 01:15:44,614
it's just some little bitch
trying to get back at me

1091
01:15:44,615 --> 01:15:46,284
for flunking her on a test.

1092
01:15:46,285 --> 01:15:48,219
She made the whole thing up.

1093
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:50,521
I mean-

1094
01:15:50,522 --> 01:15:53,456
come on, you know I would
never do anything like that.

1095
01:15:56,295 --> 01:15:58,854
Are you aware that...

1096
01:16:00,132 --> 01:16:02,867
that rape is a very serious charge?

1097
01:16:02,868 --> 01:16:06,037
Of course she's aware that rape
is a very serious charge.

1098
01:16:06,038 --> 01:16:07,472
What the hell kind
of question is that?

1099
01:16:07,473 --> 01:16:08,873
Miss Van Hafton,
are you also aware

1100
01:16:08,874 --> 01:16:12,744
that your school is equipped
with a very comprehensive

1101
01:16:12,745 --> 01:16:15,577
system of surveillance cameras?

1102
01:16:18,151 --> 01:16:20,084
I'm sorry, what?

1103
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:33,098
You're such an idiot.

1104
01:16:33,099 --> 01:16:35,658
What?

1105
01:16:36,836 --> 01:16:40,439
They have you on tape, Barry.

1106
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,641
What?

1107
01:16:42,642 --> 01:16:44,543
They have you

1108
01:16:44,544 --> 01:16:47,046
on tape

1109
01:16:47,047 --> 01:16:50,750
fucking a 16-year-old girl

1110
01:16:50,751 --> 01:16:53,685
right in the high school parking lot.

1111
01:17:00,861 --> 01:17:03,163
What kind of moron are you?

1112
01:17:03,164 --> 01:17:05,899
How many other teenyboppers
have you fucked?

1113
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:08,630
None! None!
Never! Never!

1114
01:17:10,938 --> 01:17:14,236
I- who told you
that there was tape?

1115
01:17:15,342 --> 01:17:17,936
The police.

1116
01:17:19,047 --> 01:17:22,209
In our car, Barry?

1117
01:17:23,251 --> 01:17:26,185
The car my father paid for?

1118
01:17:27,355 --> 01:17:30,016
God damn it, Barry.

1119
01:17:36,131 --> 01:17:38,360
It-

1120
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:53,107
All right.

1121
01:17:57,053 --> 01:17:58,954
I admit I had sex
with her

1122
01:17:58,955 --> 01:18:01,523
once in the car.

1123
01:18:01,524 --> 01:18:04,459
But she- she came onto me
so many times.

1124
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:07,028
She was like a Lolita.
You have no idea,

1125
01:18:07,029 --> 01:18:10,589
honey, the lengths that this girl
went to to seduce me.

1126
01:18:11,434 --> 01:18:13,925
And I-

1127
01:18:15,104 --> 01:18:18,139
Yeah, I got weak.
All right? I admit it.

1128
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:21,007
But I didn't rape her.

1129
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:25,209
Seduce you?

1130
01:18:26,416 --> 01:18:29,485
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

1131
01:18:29,486 --> 01:18:32,054
You're the grownup.

1132
01:18:32,055 --> 01:18:34,921
- You should have known better!
- I know! I know!

1133
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:41,230
Is it me?

1134
01:18:41,231 --> 01:18:43,699
Is it because I'm just so
fat and ugly now

1135
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:46,202
- you have to go out and fuck someone?
- No no no no.

1136
01:18:46,203 --> 01:18:48,170
No, honey, I love you.
I love you.

1137
01:18:48,171 --> 01:18:50,765
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever known and I love you.

1138
01:18:54,812 --> 01:18:57,212
I'm so sorry.

1139
01:19:29,281 --> 01:19:31,510
I'm sorry.

1140
01:19:39,391 --> 01:19:41,592
Okay.

1141
01:19:41,593 --> 01:19:43,795
You know what?

1142
01:19:43,796 --> 01:19:47,060
I've heard everything
I needed to hear, okay?

1143
01:19:47,599 --> 01:19:49,902
I'm going back to Philly
to have the baby there.

1144
01:19:49,903 --> 01:19:52,037
Don't go.

1145
01:19:52,038 --> 01:19:54,870
I hope she was worth it.

1146
01:20:04,651 --> 01:20:07,886
How about some stir-fried
chicken and vegetables?

1147
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:10,022
How does that sound?
Does that sound good?

1148
01:20:10,023 --> 01:20:12,150
No.

1149
01:20:13,426 --> 01:20:15,828
Now, Megan,
if you want to eat ice cream,

1150
01:20:15,829 --> 01:20:17,930
you have to eat
a healthier meal, okay?

1151
01:20:17,931 --> 01:20:20,266
- Okay.
- Okay.

1152
01:20:20,267 --> 01:20:22,502
All right, I'll be right back.

1153
01:20:22,503 --> 01:20:25,071
- You are the guarder of the bags.
- Okay.

1154
01:20:25,072 --> 01:20:26,473
- You are in charge.
- Okay.

1155
01:20:26,474 --> 01:20:28,464
- All right?
- Uh-huh.

1156
01:20:54,136 --> 01:20:56,404
You must be Megan.

1157
01:20:56,405 --> 01:20:59,032
I'm your mother's friend Joe.

1158
01:21:01,276 --> 01:21:03,811
This is Marty...

1159
01:21:03,812 --> 01:21:05,939
Listen, I've got some good news.

1160
01:21:19,828 --> 01:21:21,956
Megan?

1161
01:21:28,071 --> 01:21:30,471
Megan?

1162
01:21:34,644 --> 01:21:36,545
Excuse me, did you happen
to see a little girl?

1163
01:21:36,546 --> 01:21:38,914
She was sitting right here.
She had a purple shirt on.

1164
01:21:38,915 --> 01:21:41,416
She had a purple shirt on,
short brown hair.

1165
01:21:41,417 --> 01:21:43,919
No, I was turned around.

1166
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,121
Megan?

1167
01:21:46,122 --> 01:21:48,256
My little girl was just sitting
here a minute ago.

1168
01:21:48,257 --> 01:21:50,292
No one? You didn't see
her leave or anything?

1169
01:21:50,293 --> 01:21:52,028
Oh my God.

1170
01:21:52,029 --> 01:21:54,929
Megan!

1171
01:21:57,801 --> 01:21:59,962
Megan!

1172
01:22:00,471 --> 01:22:02,705
Megan!
Oh my God.

1173
01:22:02,706 --> 01:22:05,842
Megan! Oh my God.
Somebody help me.

1174
01:22:05,843 --> 01:22:08,878
Megan!

1175
01:22:08,879 --> 01:22:11,848
My little girl was sitting right here.

1176
01:22:11,849 --> 01:22:14,817
All I did was go to get some food

1177
01:22:14,818 --> 01:22:16,652
and I don't know where she is now.

1178
01:22:16,653 --> 01:22:18,677
Control, stand by.

1179
01:22:19,289 --> 01:22:20,923
Willie:
¶¶ And I'm dead drunk on the playground ¶¶

1180
01:22:20,924 --> 01:22:23,694
¶¶ Today ¶¶

1181
01:22:23,695 --> 01:22:25,596
¶¶ I scare the kids ¶¶

1182
01:22:25,597 --> 01:22:29,933
¶¶ Who come here to play ¶¶

1183
01:22:29,934 --> 01:22:33,470
¶¶ And, Amanda,
won't you come back ¶¶

1184
01:22:33,471 --> 01:22:36,373
¶¶ 'Cause my brain ¶¶

1185
01:22:36,374 --> 01:22:42,210
¶¶ It cannot live at all this way ¶¶

1186
01:22:42,881 --> 01:22:46,283
¶¶ 'Cause you had to do
your thing ¶¶

1187
01:22:46,284 --> 01:22:49,786
¶¶ I had to do my thing ¶¶

1188
01:22:49,787 --> 01:22:53,553
¶¶ But we both
did nothing at all. ¶¶

1189
01:22:57,963 --> 01:23:00,265
- Holy shit, man.
- What?

1190
01:23:00,266 --> 01:23:01,833
What?

1191
01:23:01,834 --> 01:23:04,369
Those guys look just like
the Candid Camera Killers, man.

1192
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:06,304
The two guys that killed
the fucking cop.

1193
01:23:06,305 --> 01:23:09,240
Oh my gosh.
Should we like call the cops or something?

1194
01:23:09,241 --> 01:23:10,975
What are you talking about?

1195
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:14,879
On the news they showed dashboard
footage of two guys killing a fucking cop

1196
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,048
and they looked just like
them motherfuckers, man.

1197
01:23:17,049 --> 01:23:19,951
Carl:
No way, I know those guys.

1198
01:23:19,952 --> 01:23:21,920
It wasn't them.
Those are nice guys.

1199
01:23:21,921 --> 01:23:23,956
How the fuck do you know them?

1200
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:26,025
The other night when you
were in the diner

1201
01:23:26,026 --> 01:23:27,693
they came in.

1202
01:23:27,694 --> 01:23:30,196
I couldn't get
the register open, right?

1203
01:23:30,197 --> 01:23:33,299
They gave me 40 bucks for like
10 bucks worth of shit

1204
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,134
and they said keep the change.

1205
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:36,936
Those are nice guys.

1206
01:23:36,937 --> 01:23:38,704
I thought you said nobody
came in here, man.

1207
01:23:38,705 --> 01:23:41,307
Oh, I did?
Oh. I lied.

1208
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:43,435
Fucking asshole.

1209
01:23:46,213 --> 01:23:47,913
Amanda:
Um, they're coming in here.

1210
01:23:47,914 --> 01:23:51,281
All right, Amanda, just get to
the bathroom and stay there, all right?

1211
01:24:14,342 --> 01:24:17,043
- Sherri.
- Barry.

1212
01:24:17,044 --> 01:24:19,535
Mr. Krebbs.

1213
01:24:20,047 --> 01:24:23,539
Is that what you want me to call you
when you're fucking me?

1214
01:24:26,955 --> 01:24:28,789
Holly.

1215
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:32,126
I just fucked Mr. Krebbs.

1216
01:24:32,127 --> 01:24:34,228
In the school parking lot.

1217
01:24:34,229 --> 01:24:36,597
Meet me at Denny's immediately.

1218
01:24:41,403 --> 01:24:43,598
I'm sorry.

1219
01:24:55,885 --> 01:24:57,818
- Hey.
- Hey.

1220
01:24:58,821 --> 01:25:00,689
You're the new guy.
I remember.

1221
01:25:00,690 --> 01:25:02,824
Carl: That's me.

1222
01:25:02,825 --> 01:25:05,193
What are you doing
on this side of the counter?

1223
01:25:05,194 --> 01:25:08,254
I got fired.

1224
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:13,828
It's a tough business,
this mini-mart shit, huh?

1225
01:25:15,872 --> 01:25:18,237
$16.68.

1226
01:25:28,919 --> 01:25:31,614
All right, thanks.

1227
01:25:39,396 --> 01:25:41,631
That's them, man.

1228
01:25:41,632 --> 01:25:43,266
What are you doing?

1229
01:25:43,267 --> 01:25:46,395
Calling the fucking cops, man.

1230
01:25:48,305 --> 01:25:51,207
Hello.
Yes, the Candid Camera Killers.

1231
01:25:51,208 --> 01:25:52,775
The two guys that killed the cop,

1232
01:25:52,776 --> 01:25:54,310
they're leaving my convenience store

1233
01:25:54,311 --> 01:25:57,014
on Huber and 15th right now
in a black car.

1234
01:25:57,015 --> 01:25:59,950
Their license plate

1235
01:25:59,951 --> 01:26:04,355
is F-O-O-T-D-O-C.

1236
01:26:04,356 --> 01:26:07,024
We've called the police.
They're on their way.

1237
01:26:07,025 --> 01:26:09,059
Our staff, they're combing
the mall right now.

1238
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:11,061
Have you been able to
reach your husband yet?

1239
01:26:11,062 --> 01:26:15,362
No, he has his fucking
phone turned off.

1240
01:26:20,972 --> 01:26:22,740
All right.

1241
01:26:22,741 --> 01:26:25,509
We got some good news
and we got some bad news.

1242
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:28,980
She admitted it
wasn't a forcible rape.

1243
01:26:28,981 --> 01:26:30,782
Thank God.

1244
01:26:30,783 --> 01:26:32,550
Not so fast.

1245
01:26:32,551 --> 01:26:36,782
Bad news is statutory rape
is still rape in the eyes of the law.

1246
01:26:41,293 --> 01:26:43,161
Ben, you've got to
get me out of this.

1247
01:26:43,162 --> 01:26:47,232
I mean, she came on to me.
The tape proves that, right?

1248
01:26:47,233 --> 01:26:49,033
It doesn't matter.

1249
01:26:49,034 --> 01:26:52,771
Look, she could be wearing
two band-aids,

1250
01:26:52,772 --> 01:26:55,306
a dollop of whipped cream,
six-inch fuck-me pumps

1251
01:26:55,307 --> 01:26:56,474
and begging for it.

1252
01:26:56,475 --> 01:26:59,879
If she's a minor, you as the adult
are supposed to walk away.

1253
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:01,647
I know.

1254
01:27:01,648 --> 01:27:05,651
I'm not saying it doesn't go
against every male instinct

1255
01:27:05,652 --> 01:27:08,654
that has been genetically passed
down through millions of years.

1256
01:27:08,655 --> 01:27:11,090
I mean, between you and me,
I've seen her.

1257
01:27:11,091 --> 01:27:14,193
Would have been a tough call
for any man.

1258
01:27:14,194 --> 01:27:17,390
You did it,
those are facts.

1259
01:27:20,667 --> 01:27:22,568
So what happens next?

1260
01:27:22,569 --> 01:27:24,969
Look, it's all on tape.

1261
01:27:25,472 --> 01:27:27,240
You've got to plead no contest
and hope

1262
01:27:27,241 --> 01:27:30,437
that because this is your first offense
you can get away with minimum.

1263
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:35,443
So can I get off with like a fine
or something and community service?

1264
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:39,552
You don't watch much TV,
do you?

1265
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:42,222
Look,

1266
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:45,158
if a person convicted
of statutory rape

1267
01:27:45,159 --> 01:27:48,361
is 21 years of age or older,
that's you,

1268
01:27:48,362 --> 01:27:51,965
and is eight years or more than
eight years older than the victim,

1269
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:54,167
which is also you,

1270
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:57,672
then no part of the minimum
sentence can be stayed,

1271
01:27:57,673 --> 01:27:59,740
probated or suspended.

1272
01:27:59,741 --> 01:28:01,542
What the hell does that mean?

1273
01:28:01,543 --> 01:28:04,245
I mean, what-
what's the minimum?

1274
01:28:04,246 --> 01:28:06,737
10 years.

1275
01:28:10,252 --> 01:28:12,520
And it could have been so much worse.
It could have been 20.

1276
01:28:12,521 --> 01:28:16,190
But because she lied
and we have the evidence on tape

1277
01:28:16,191 --> 01:28:19,125
I'm sure that we can get the minimum.

1278
01:28:20,229 --> 01:28:24,065
Of course, you'll have to register
as a sex offender when you get out.

1279
01:28:24,066 --> 01:28:26,300
And, uh,

1280
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:28,237
forget about teaching ever again.

1281
01:28:28,238 --> 01:28:30,706
And as far as your
unborn child goes,

1282
01:28:30,707 --> 01:28:33,642
you can forget about custody.
That's gonna be impossible.

1283
01:28:33,643 --> 01:28:37,044
But I can probably get you
supervised visitation rights.

1284
01:28:38,248 --> 01:28:39,815
All in all you're getting off
pretty easy.

1285
01:28:59,403 --> 01:29:01,004
Man:
I'm sorry to cut you off, Bonnie,

1286
01:29:01,005 --> 01:29:03,973
but what we're looking at here
is a high-speed pursuit in progress.

1287
01:29:03,974 --> 01:29:06,643
Police believe that
the Candid Camera Killers,

1288
01:29:06,644 --> 01:29:09,012
the alleged murderers
of Officer Lawrence Garby,

1289
01:29:09,013 --> 01:29:10,313
architect Stanley Jeffers

1290
01:29:10,314 --> 01:29:13,383
and abductors of Francine Figgs
are in that black sedan

1291
01:29:13,384 --> 01:29:15,318
heading north on Interstate 17.

1292
01:29:15,319 --> 01:29:18,087
- Can you believe this?
- Shit, man.

1293
01:29:18,088 --> 01:29:21,190
- A fast-thinking Quickie Mart clerk...
- Shit.

1294
01:29:21,191 --> 01:29:22,626
...took a picture
of the license plate

1295
01:29:22,627 --> 01:29:24,160
with a video phone
mere moments ago.

1296
01:29:24,161 --> 01:29:26,129
I could have been fucking killed.

1297
01:29:26,130 --> 01:29:28,757
No shit, man.

1298
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:48,919
We've seen some harrowing near misses
in speeds in excess of 80mph.

1299
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:52,590
The stolen car is registered
to a Dr. Vanay Rubastaba.

1300
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:47,546
- Oh!
- Oh shit!

1301
01:30:47,547 --> 01:30:50,116
Reporter: Whoa, did you see that?
That looks bad.

1302
01:30:50,117 --> 01:30:51,717
Motherfucker, man!

1303
01:30:51,718 --> 01:30:54,311
- Oh my God.
- Damn.

1304
01:30:55,622 --> 01:30:57,757
- I'm Ben Rosen, my wife-
- Follow me, sir.

1305
01:30:57,758 --> 01:31:00,026
Louise!
Baby, what happened?

1306
01:31:00,027 --> 01:31:01,695
- What happened?
- Oh, God, Ben.

1307
01:31:01,696 --> 01:31:03,664
I was just getting some food

1308
01:31:03,665 --> 01:31:06,533
and I swear to God
I was just 10 feet away from her.

1309
01:31:06,534 --> 01:31:08,635
I swear to God
I just looked for a second.

1310
01:31:08,636 --> 01:31:11,271
Why can't they find her, Ben?

1311
01:31:11,272 --> 01:31:14,241
- Why can't they find her?
- Shh.

1312
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:11,395
¶¶ Couldn't look you in the eye ¶¶

1313
01:33:11,396 --> 01:33:14,956
¶¶ You were someone else's lie ¶¶

1314
01:33:15,667 --> 01:33:19,295
¶¶ So you trash a little light ¶¶

1315
01:33:20,238 --> 01:33:23,073
¶¶ And when the colors seem to fade ¶¶

1316
01:33:23,074 --> 01:33:26,177
¶¶ Everything is black and gray ¶¶

1317
01:33:26,178 --> 01:33:28,746
¶¶ I couldn't look ¶¶

1318
01:33:28,747 --> 01:33:31,982
¶¶ I couldn't walk away ¶¶

1319
01:33:31,983 --> 01:33:35,817
¶¶ 'Cause you couldn't stay ¶¶

1320
01:33:36,989 --> 01:33:41,448
¶¶ Darling, save your love for me ¶¶

1321
01:33:42,995 --> 01:33:47,090
¶¶ Darling, save your love for me ¶¶

1322
01:33:48,601 --> 01:33:52,137
¶¶ If only you could set me free ¶¶

1323
01:33:52,138 --> 01:33:55,903
¶¶ Then I could live again ¶¶

1324
01:33:57,009 --> 01:34:01,605
¶¶ We'll start it where the story ends ¶¶

1325
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:10,378
¶¶ Darling, save your love for me ¶¶

1326
01:34:12,159 --> 01:34:16,288
¶¶ Darling, save your love for me ¶¶

1327
01:34:17,831 --> 01:34:21,500
¶¶ Look into this broken lens ¶¶

1328
01:34:21,501 --> 01:34:25,129
¶¶ And we can write the end ¶¶

1329
01:34:26,506 --> 01:34:31,033
¶¶ We'll start it where
the story ends. ¶¶

1330
01:34:43,091 --> 01:34:45,058
I got the photo of the damage

1331
01:34:45,059 --> 01:34:47,227
and it looks like they
clobbered you pretty good.

1332
01:34:47,228 --> 01:34:50,998
It looks like that
back rear-panel section

1333
01:34:50,999 --> 01:34:52,599
is probably gonna
have to go entirely.

1334
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,568
But the sides are-

1335
01:34:54,569 --> 01:34:56,403
there's just one little scratch, right.

1336
01:34:56,404 --> 01:34:58,705
And I think the best way
to go about that

1337
01:34:58,706 --> 01:35:00,173
would be to-

1338
01:35:00,174 --> 01:35:02,801
Are you Martin Dougle?

1339
01:35:08,284 --> 01:35:09,951
Yes.

1340
01:35:09,952 --> 01:35:13,250
I think you know
why I'm here.

1341
01:35:16,191 --> 01:35:18,626
'Cause it's your birthday!

1342
01:35:18,627 --> 01:35:20,128
Hit it!

1343
01:35:20,129 --> 01:35:22,824
¶¶ Everybody dance now... ¶¶

1344
01:35:35,946 --> 01:35:38,914
¶¶ Everybody dance now... ¶¶

1345
01:35:38,915 --> 01:35:40,950
You want it.

1346
01:35:40,951 --> 01:35:43,385
You know you do.

1347
01:35:44,821 --> 01:35:47,323
¶¶ Everybody dance now ¶¶

1348
01:35:47,324 --> 01:35:51,225
¶¶ Yeah yeah ¶¶

1349
01:35:51,728 --> 01:35:53,262
¶¶ Yeah ¶¶

1350
01:35:53,263 --> 01:35:55,831
¶¶ Everybody dance now ¶¶

1351
01:35:55,832 --> 01:35:59,034
¶¶ Yeah yeah ¶¶

1352
01:35:59,035 --> 01:36:01,103
¶¶ Yeah... ¶¶

1353
01:36:28,566 --> 01:36:32,035
¶¶ Opening a can of worms ¶¶

1354
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:36,540
¶¶ That are now out of date ¶¶

1355
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:40,111
¶¶ No matter what you do ¶¶

1356
01:36:40,112 --> 01:36:44,582
¶¶ Don't you dare throw them away ¶¶

1357
01:36:44,583 --> 01:36:48,586
¶¶ A harlot spikes the bowl ¶¶

1358
01:36:48,587 --> 01:36:52,590
¶¶ With regurgitated brains ¶¶

1359
01:36:52,591 --> 01:36:56,060
¶¶ We hide under
a broken rainbow ¶¶

1360
01:36:56,061 --> 01:37:01,260
¶¶ Waiting for the rain to fade ¶¶

1361
01:37:16,349 --> 01:37:20,619
¶¶ Déjà vu ¶¶

1362
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:24,623
¶¶ It sounds like something not true ¶¶

1363
01:37:24,624 --> 01:37:27,459
¶¶ But I think ¶¶

1364
01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:32,631
¶¶ That I have seen it with you ¶¶

1365
01:37:32,632 --> 01:37:35,467
¶¶ I am sure ¶¶

1366
01:37:35,468 --> 01:37:40,606
¶¶ I've never been here before ¶¶

1367
01:37:40,607 --> 01:37:43,643
¶¶ It's there's at my door ¶¶

1368
01:37:43,644 --> 01:37:48,047
¶¶ That is running on the floor ¶¶

1369
01:37:48,048 --> 01:37:50,850
¶¶ High ¶¶

1370
01:37:50,851 --> 01:37:55,555
¶¶ Up at the shooting range ¶¶

1371
01:37:55,556 --> 01:37:59,525
¶¶ Where the kids play ¶¶

1372
01:37:59,526 --> 01:38:03,463
¶¶ And there's bad blood ¶¶

1373
01:38:03,464 --> 01:38:06,558
¶¶ We were high ¶¶

1374
01:38:07,067 --> 01:38:11,305
¶¶ And feeling no pain ¶¶

1375
01:38:11,306 --> 01:38:15,442
¶¶ Where the trash drains ¶¶

1376
01:38:15,443 --> 01:38:20,471
¶¶ Is where we will lie ¶¶

1377
01:38:52,548 --> 01:38:55,750
¶¶ Looking out the window ¶¶

1378
01:38:55,751 --> 01:39:00,155
¶¶ With a hot beer on the red-eye ¶¶

1379
01:39:00,156 --> 01:39:03,258
¶¶ It seems so still ¶¶

1380
01:39:03,259 --> 01:39:07,695
¶¶ I know we're cruising fast
against the sky ¶¶

1381
01:39:07,696 --> 01:39:11,567
¶¶ The mountains below ¶¶

1382
01:39:11,568 --> 01:39:16,238
¶¶ They all have faces of snow ¶¶

1383
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:19,308
¶¶ They're bigger than I thought ¶¶

1384
01:39:19,309 --> 01:39:22,645
¶¶ They're almost touching me ¶¶

1385
01:39:22,646 --> 01:39:25,808
¶¶ But I'm high ¶¶

1386
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:31,487
¶¶ Up at the shooting range ¶¶

1387

¶¶ All their gun games ¶¶

¶¶ We're high ¶¶

1390

¶¶ And feeling no pain ¶¶

1391
01:39:47,104 --> 01:39:51,408
¶¶ Where the trash drains ¶¶

1392
01:39:51,409 --> 01:39:56,313
¶¶ Is where we'll lie ¶¶

1393
01:39:56,314 --> 01:39:59,349
¶¶ High ¶¶

1394
01:39:59,350 --> 01:40:03,453
¶¶ Up at the shooting range ¶¶

¶¶ And there's bad blood ¶¶

1397
01:40:11,830 --> 01:40:14,560
¶¶ We were high. ¶¶

1398
01:40:36,555 --> 01:40:40,259
¶¶ I'm getting electrocuted ¶¶

1399
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:43,295
¶¶ I am getting my head burned up ¶¶

1400
01:40:43,296 --> 01:40:47,165
¶¶ I am getting electrocuted ¶¶

1401
01:40:47,166 --> 01:40:50,702
¶¶ 'Cause I killed all of my neighbors ¶¶

1402
01:40:50,703 --> 01:40:54,039
¶¶ Burn me up, burn me up ¶¶

1403
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:57,175
¶¶ Burn me up,
burn me up ¶¶

1404
01:40:57,176 --> 01:40:59,344
¶¶ Yeah, burn me up ¶¶

1405

¶¶ By a jury of soccer moms ¶¶

1409

¶¶ Though I tried hard to dispute it ¶¶

1410

to hear that song ¶¶

1411
01:41:18,132 --> 01:41:22,035
¶¶ Burn me up, burn me up ¶¶

1412
01:41:22,036 --> 01:41:25,405
¶¶ Burn me up,
burn me up ¶¶

1413
01:41:25,406 --> 01:41:27,540
¶¶ Yeah, burn me up ¶¶

1414
