1
00:00:04,163 --> 00:00:06,154
All right. Fine!

2
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,674
Is she OK? Where is she going?

3
00:00:17,763 --> 00:00:21,073
She's fine. She gets stressed.
I have her looping around the block.

4
00:00:21,163 --> 00:00:26,362
<i>Too late for a mass evacuation, the situation
is dangerous and potentially catastrophic.</i>

5
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:32,552
<i>But all the citizens of New York can do
is sit, wait and pray for a miracle.</i>

6
00:00:32,643 --> 00:00:38,718
<i>We're now getting a live picture of the missile
as it approaches the city.</i>

7
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:43,279
<i>It appears certain that... Wait, what is that?</i>

8
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,482
<i>It is G-Girl!</i>

9
00:00:48,363 --> 00:00:53,039
<i>- She is approaching the errant missile.
- (man) Love that girl!</i>

10
00:00:54,243 --> 00:00:55,722
<i>My God!</i>

11
00:00:55,803 --> 00:00:58,192
<i>She just kicked it.</i>

12
00:00:58,283 --> 00:01:02,481
<i>She just deflected the missile
away from the city.</i>

13
00:01:04,403 --> 00:01:06,758
<i>We're safe! We are safe!</i>

14
00:01:07,843 --> 00:01:09,879
<i>(crowd cheers)</i>

15
00:01:18,163 --> 00:01:21,041
<i>(crowd chants) G-Girl! G-Girl! G-Girl!</i>

16
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:40,193
You know, Matt, there are some things
I don't need infravision to see through.

17
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:44,162
Sorry, what are you talking about?

18
00:01:44,243 --> 00:01:47,633
You and that slut from your office - Hannah.

19
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:52,001
She is not a slut.
That is a terrible thing to say, Jenny.

20
00:01:53,923 --> 00:01:58,519
- You want to screw her, don't you?
- No. No, I do not.

21
00:01:58,603 --> 00:02:00,355
I don't believe you.

22
00:02:00,443 --> 00:02:02,434
Can I say something?

23
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:05,481
Her boyfriend's a male model, OK? A model.

24
00:02:05,563 --> 00:02:08,361
I don't think she'd be very interested
in a guy like me.

25
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:10,161
I see your point.

26
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:14,680
So you want to screw her, you just can't,
because she's got a boyfriend.

27
00:02:14,763 --> 00:02:19,075
No, I'm just saying that we're friends
who work together. We're work friends.

28
00:02:19,163 --> 00:02:21,916
Don't lie to me!

29
00:02:25,443 --> 00:02:30,039
- What the hell did you do that for?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30
00:02:30,123 --> 00:02:33,081
I'll pay for that, I swear.

31
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:39,313
OK, don't... d-don't do that.

32
00:02:39,403 --> 00:02:42,236
Don't cry, OK? It'll be OK.

33
00:02:43,203 --> 00:02:46,673
I know I get a little crazy sometimes.

34
00:02:46,763 --> 00:02:48,754
It's just...

35
00:02:50,483 --> 00:02:52,872
I love you so much.

36
00:02:57,683 --> 00:03:255,878
OK... OK...

37
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:16,399
- Hey.
- Hey. How's it going?

38
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,274
Oh, sorry.

39
00:03:19,363 --> 00:03:23,197
Look at her. She's like a cheerleader
from Spank Me University.

40
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:28,957
Dude, what's wrong?
You look like shit.

41
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:32,877
Let's go with the lighter weight today,
shall we?

42
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:37,514
I'm actually thinking that
my first impression of Jenny was accurate.

43
00:03:37,603 --> 00:03:42,119
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, complete emotional basket case.

44
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,557
- Needy, jealous...
- Mm-hm. Jealous.

45
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:48,715
...control...
- Controlling. A trifecta. Perfect.

46
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:51,601
The truth is, I don't even love her.

47
00:03:53,963 --> 00:03:56,477
I'm in love with somebody else.

48
00:03:56,563 --> 00:03:58,713
You're in love with somebody else? Who?

49
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:01,112
Is it me? Oh, my God, it's me, isn't it?

50
00:04:01,203 --> 00:04:03,876
I feel the same way. I totally...

51
00:04:05,843 --> 00:04:08,596
That's not a good sign, is it?

52
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:12,278
- Who are you talking about?
- I don't wanna say. Not until I've told her.

53
00:04:12,363 --> 00:04:14,923
But, I mean, first I have
to break it off with Jenny.

54
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:18,473
- God knows how I'm gonna do that.
- OK, come with me. Listen.

55
00:04:18,563 --> 00:04:22,522
There are only two ways to successfully
break it off with a woman.

56
00:04:22,603 --> 00:04:25,163
You can either be ajerk or a weenie.

57
00:04:25,243 --> 00:04:30,636
Now, the jerk route is simple. You're like,
"Hey, babe, listen up. I'm dumping your ass."

58
00:04:30,723 --> 00:04:33,556
Just like that. It's quick, it's easy, it's painless.

59
00:04:33,643 --> 00:04:37,556
- I don't think you have the balls for it.
- Well, what's the weenie route?

60
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:40,635
OK, good. Weenie route. Let's go with that.

61
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:44,033
Sit real close, keep it romantic, OK?

62
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:49,595
Keep a kind of a sparkle in the eye,
take her hand. Give me your hand.

63
00:04:49,683 --> 00:04:52,072
You say, "Sweetheart,

64
00:04:52,163 --> 00:04:57,521
I think we need to take a little time off
from the relationship to re-evaluate things."

65
00:04:57,603 --> 00:05:00,071
Don't return any of her calls
for a year and a half.

66
00:05:00,163 --> 00:05:03,235
Pretty soon she'll give up
and you'll be in the clear.

67
00:05:03,323 --> 00:05:05,473
I can't believe I actually listen to you.

68
00:05:05,563 --> 00:05:08,839
Another thing. Make sure you do it
after you've had sex with her.

69
00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:11,562
It's really difficult the other way around.

70
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:27,034
<i>I was thinking, maybe we should
take a little time to... (clears throat)</i>

71
00:05:27,123 --> 00:05:29,717
Re-examine where this is going.

72
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:36,034
My God.

73
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,717
Are you breaking up with me?

74
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,721
No. No. Not at all.

75
00:05:45,403 --> 00:05:52,320
I mean, I just... I think it would be wise
to try and evaluate where we stand,

76
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:56,162
just to make sure we're on the same page.

77
00:05:58,043 --> 00:06:03,481
So you're not saying that we should
start seeing other people or anything?

78
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,952
No. No.

79
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:08,511
<i>- No, I'm not saying that.
- (relieved sigh)</i>

80
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:12,118
OK, good. You scared me there for a second.

81
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:19,075
Although seeing other people might
eventually be a part of the evaluation process.

82
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:27,034
Oh, my God.

83
00:06:28,363 --> 00:06:30,115
You are breaking up with me.

84
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:34,037
- Jenny, it's not you, OK?
- Shut up!

85
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:42,997
I know exactly what it is.
It's that slut from your office, Hannah.

86
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,472
- You're sleeping with her.
- I am not sleep...

87
00:06:45,563 --> 00:06:49,192
- But you want to!
- Jenny, now, hold on a second, OK?

88
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,843
You're such a liar!

89
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:57,236
Look, I am not a liar, all right? You wanna
know the truth? It's not Hannah, OK? It's you.

90
00:06:57,323 --> 00:07:00,872
You're needy, jealous, manipulative.
I can't take it any more.

91
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:03,955
- It's crazy.
- Don't call me crazy!

92
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:12,592
See? That's the kind of thing I'm talking
about. I can't handle that on a daily basis.

93
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,753
Well, handle this.

94
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,961
What are you doing?!

95
00:07:26,603 --> 00:07:29,515
You are so gonna regret this.

96
00:07:34,843 --> 00:07:36,834
Oh, man.

97
00:07:44,123 --> 00:07:45,920
- Wednesday? Thursday?
- No. No.

98
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:49,120
Friday? Saturday? Sunday?
Brunch? In the day?

99
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:51,194
Don't speak to me.

100
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:57,437
Oh, well. Look at it this way.

101
00:07:57,523 --> 00:08:255,753
The hard part is over.

102
00:08:255,843 --> 00:08:02,038
I don't know. She said I'd regret it.

103
00:08:02,643 --> 00:08:04,998
Don't worry about that. They always say that.

104
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,835
Yeah?

105
00:08:06,923 --> 00:08:08,914
I guess you're right.

106
00:08:09,803 --> 00:08:15,514
You know, there's something that I've been
dying to tell you ever since I found it out.

107
00:08:15,603 --> 00:08:18,276
- Found out what?
- I just need you to promise me...

108
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:21,275
- I promise.
- Hold on, let me finish, this is serious.

109
00:08:21,363 --> 00:08:27,359
- I need you to promise me that you're not...
- I promise. I won't tell anybody. Tell me.

110
00:08:28,403 --> 00:08:30,871
You know Jenny?

111
00:08:32,963 --> 00:08:34,954
Yeah.

112
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,674
She's G-Girl.

113
00:08:46,723 --> 00:08:48,714
Bullshit.

114
00:08:49,443 --> 00:08:50,592
Bullshit.

115
00:08:50,683 --> 00:08:53,720
Apparently, this old dog
still has a few tricks left.

116
00:08:53,803 --> 00:08:56,795
Oh, my God, you have been doing G-Girl!

117
00:08:56,883 --> 00:09:255,522
- I know! It's unbelievable. Me.
- Incredible.

118
00:09:255,603 --> 00:09:01,321
- I can't believe it.
- Knuckles.

119
00:09:01,403 --> 00:09:04,315
Imagine the heat I'll have
with the women when they find out.

120
00:09:04,403 --> 00:09:08,282
Wait. Whoa. Isn't she gonna mind
you revealing her secret identity?

121
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:11,196
I warned you, Matt Saunders!

122
00:09:11,963 --> 00:09:13,635
No!

123
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:21,360

Everything's great. Never better.

OK. I, uh... I broke up with Jenny.

134
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:08,954
You were right. I mean, she is
totally deranged, off-her-rocker crazy.

135
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:12,194
I should have listened to you
from the beginning.

136

Why don't you lay off
the crazy women for a while, huh?

137
00:10:15,363 --> 00:10:17,957
Come here. I'm sorry.

138
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:20,034
Hey, Hannah.

139
00:10:20,883 --> 00:10:24,558
There's been something that I've been
meaning to tell you for a long time.

140
00:10:24,643 --> 00:10:26,634
Yes?

141
00:10:26,723 --> 00:10:28,600
It's about you and...

142
00:10:33,163 --> 00:10:35,154
- Sorry. Are you OK?
- Out. Now.

143
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:37,359
I'm going through a weird phase.

144
00:10:37,443 --> 00:10:39,798
- I saw that!
- What? No, it was nothing, Carla.

145
00:10:39,883 --> 00:10:42,397
Nothing? You knocked her down! You hit her!

146
00:10:42,483 --> 00:10:46,556
- Was there groping? Did he grope you?
- No, it was an accident.

147
00:10:46,643 --> 00:10:48,634
An accident? OK, like a fender-bender?

148
00:10:48,723 --> 00:10:51,396
Here, we need to talk. Come here.

Listen, my friend.
You are headed for some serious trouble.

150
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,041
- Don't make excuses. That's the first mistake.
- OK.

151
00:11:00,123 --> 00:11:04,355
You have got to get your mind out of the
gutter long enough to nail this presentation.

152
00:11:04,443 --> 00:11:08,880
- I hear you, homegirl. I got it.
- What? What did you just call me?!

153
00:11:08,963 --> 00:11:10,157
What? I don't know.

154
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:14,839
If the company doesn't get this project,
we're going to take a major hit.

155
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:17,835
You really have a problem. Call my therapist.

156
00:11:17,923 --> 00:11:19,720
OK, I'll call him... her.

157
00:11:19,803 --> 00:11:21,521
- Matt.
- What?

158
00:11:21,603 --> 00:11:23,992
- Phone call.
- Oh, man.

159
00:11:26,123 --> 00:11:29,160
That boy has a major case of the hornies.

160
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:33,082
Yeah?

161
00:11:33,163 --> 00:11:36,519
There's the young kid that zooms around
in here. Did he do something?

162
00:11:36,603 --> 00:11:40,278
- It's just up here.
- Looks like they broke in, fried the camera

163
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:42,558
and then blew a huge hole
through the wall.

164
00:11:42,643 --> 00:11:45,874
- I've never seen nothing like it.
- Don't make no sense.

165
00:11:45,963 --> 00:11:48,761
We got a lot of nice cars -
his is the only one they took.

166
00:11:48,843 --> 00:11:50,481
Bitch.

167
00:11:50,563 --> 00:11:56,274
Somebody went to a lot of trouble.
You know who could have done this?

168
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:58,672
No. No, I don't.

169
00:11:58,763 --> 00:12:02,756
- Somebody with a grudge against you?
- Grudge? Against me?

170
00:12:04,163 --> 00:12:06,597
No. No, I don't. I'm sorry.

171
00:12:06,683 --> 00:12:08,878
- We'll let you know if it turns up.
- OK.

172
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:12,717
- Let's get to the paperwork.
- I wouldn't hold my breath on that, sir.

Sorry, just came to use your telescope.
Nice and dark, isn't it?

179
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,562
Wait a second. Is this all because of you?

180
00:12:42,643 --> 00:12:47,353
Yep, that'd be me. Ah, yes.

181
00:12:47,443 --> 00:12:49,673
There we go.

Come and have a look-see.

I don't see any...

- That's real mature.
- Save you a fortune in parking.

185
00:13:09,203 --> 00:13:13,276
Why are you doing this to me?
I mean, you're supposed to be the good guy.

00:13:13,363 --> 00:13:17,197
I am the good guy. You are the bad guy.

187

It's been a pleasure seeing you,
but I got a big day at the office tomorrow.

188
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,917
I've got an important presentation to make,
so I need to get some sleep.

189
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:29,997
I'm gonna have to say good night. You might
be the hottest girl I've ever gone out with,

You're the craziest, hands down!

I apologise. It's very rude.

Can you tell me why you're wearing a hat?

199
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:19,679
- No.
- Why am I not surprised?

200
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:22,312
- Hi. How are you?
- We can finally begin.

201
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,871
- Gentlemen, I give you Matt Saunders.
- You OK?

202
00:14:24,963 --> 00:14:27,397
I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:30,077

OK. Our design integrates

Why did you...

00:15:56,443 --> 00:16:00,356
It's hard to explain.
Let's just say it's a good time for me to leave.

224
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:04,516
- Where are you going?
- Don't know. Don't care.

225

Look, if there's something wrong,
I'd like to help.

Nice place.

You broke her heart, didn't you?

235
00:16:57,843 --> 00:17:01,074
What do you need? Why are you here?
I'm in the middle of a project.

236
00:17:01,163 --> 00:17:04,712
The same as you -
to get her out of my life for good.

237
00:17:04,803 --> 00:17:07,078
I want you to help me neutralise her.

238
00:17:07,163 --> 00:17:12,283
Hey, whatever she's done to me,
I'm not gonna help you kill her.

239
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:14,923
I didn't say "kill", I said "neutralise".

240
00:17:15,003 --> 00:17:18,200
It's a neutral word.
"Kill" is "kill". This is Switzerland.

241
00:17:18,283 --> 00:17:23,960
I have developed the means
of permanently stripping her of her powers.

242
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,596
No powers?

243
00:17:26,683 --> 00:17:31,882
So she'd just be another average,
everyday, run-of-the-mill, crazy ex-girlfriend?

244
00:17:31,963 --> 00:17:34,272
Yeah. That's gotta be better.

245
00:17:34,963 --> 00:17:39,434
- So what would you want me to do?
- Draw her out into the open.

246
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:42,640
Help me get her when her guard is down,
when she's vulnerable.

247
00:17:42,723 --> 00:17:47,274
Look, I don't mean to offend you,
but you have a reputation for doing things

248
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:49,718
that most people would consider to be...

249
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:51,475
No-nos?

250
00:17:51,563 --> 00:17:52,712
Yes.

251
00:17:52,803 --> 00:17:56,876
Yeah. Nothing to worry about. I'm retiring.

252
00:17:56,963 --> 00:18:255,113
- From supervillainy?
- Yeah.

253
00:18:255,203 --> 00:18:03,355
That's good. Look, if you're going to retire,
why notjust forget about her?

254
00:18:03,443 --> 00:18:05,911
That's what I'm gonna do.
I'm leaving town.

255
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:12,351
Because that woman, she just won't
leave me alone. She's obsessed with me.

256
00:18:12,443 --> 00:18:16,277
She has harassed me at every turn
and she never, ever stops.

257
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:22,518
So when you finally realise that she is not the
woman who is ever going to forget about you,

258
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:26,201
- then you give me a call.

Actually, two other women.

288
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:14,395
Maybe three.
I don't know - I didn't really get a good look.

Wow.

He took me to nice places

I don't really need to hear that.

The thing is,
I never really had any fun with him.

00:21:15,283 --> 00:21:20,357
You're the smartest,
most beautiful girl that I've ever met.

305
00:21:22,243 --> 00:21:25,519
And I'm completely
and totally in love with you.

306
00:21:26,723 --> 00:21:28,281
Oh.

307
00:21:46,843 --> 00:21:51,963
<i>(Matt) Oh, that was great. Didn't hurt at all.</i>

308
00:21:52,043 --> 00:21:58,676
I probably shouldn't tell you this,
but this might be the best moment of my life.

309
00:21:58,763 --> 00:22:01,516
That's not fair. I was gonna say that.

310
00:22:01,603 --> 00:22:03,036
Oh.

311
00:22:03,123 --> 00:22:05,114
<i>(Jenny) Hey! Sweetie!</i>

312
00:22:09,403 --> 00:22:10,722
Matt?

313
00:22:12,163 --> 00:22:14,802
I hate you, Matt Saunders!

314
00:22:16,963 --> 00:22:18,760
Get down!

315
00:22:41,763 --> 00:22:44,197
<i>(brakes screech, loud smash)</i>

316
00:22:45,043 --> 00:22:47,034
<i>(screaming)</i>

317
00:22:54,563 --> 00:22:57,680
Why did G-Girl throw a shark at us?

318
00:23:00,843 --> 00:23:03,198
I can't tell you.

319
00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:06,320
And she was so pissed off.
Have you done something?

320
00:23:06,403 --> 00:23:08,837
- Are you in trouble?
- No. Well, yeah.

321
00:23:08,923 --> 00:23:11,118
And as long as I'm here, so are you.

322
00:23:11,203 --> 00:23:13,876
You gotta get outside the city.
Go someplace and hide.

323
00:23:13,963 --> 00:23:16,796
San Diego. Tahiti. Utah.

324
00:23:16,883 --> 00:23:19,317
No, not Utah, Utah sucks. Anywhere else.

325
00:23:19,403 --> 00:23:21,997
But you gotta go someplace,
lay low for a while.

326
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,597
- I don't understand.
- Look.

327
00:23:24,683 --> 00:23:29,040
If I ever see you again,
this will all be over, OK?

328
00:23:29,723 --> 00:23:32,112
If?

329
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,194
Matt, wait.

330
00:24:05,723 --> 00:24:08,396
- Oh, it's you.
- Come in. Wait here.

331
00:24:09,723 --> 00:24:12,283
- Right here? Where?
- What? Right here.

332
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:15,161
- OK.
- Over there.

333
00:24:29,283 --> 00:24:31,274
Wow.

334
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:45,555
Look, I'm here cos I need your help, OK?
I just need to know how we're gonna stop her.

335
00:24:45,643 --> 00:24:51,275
I have spent the past ten years trying
to analyse the source of G-Girl's power.

336
00:24:51,363 --> 00:24:54,639
It is a unique type of radiation
that permeates every cell of her body.

337
00:24:54,723 --> 00:25:255,513
Yeah, I know about the meteor in high school.
She told me. I know.

338
00:25:255,603 --> 00:25:01,594
- She told you that?
- Yeah.

339
00:25:02,603 --> 00:25:04,992
Did she talk about me?

340
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:08,519
I mean, she said you guys were friends,
you had a falling out.

341
00:25:08,603 --> 00:25:12,835
Bullshit! That meteorite
changed everything between us.

342
00:25:12,923 --> 00:25:17,997
But now, I've got something
that will totally level the playing field.

343
00:25:21,963 --> 00:25:24,238
That?

344
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:25,961
The rock?

345
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:28,876
No, the ham. Yes, the rock.

346
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:35,079
A special rock.
It was a rock that gave off the radiation.

347
00:25:35,163 --> 00:25:38,519
I now have a rock
that will absorb the radiation.

348
00:25:39,803 --> 00:25:42,317
So if you got Jenny
close enough to this thing...

349
00:25:42,403 --> 00:25:46,442
It'll draw the radiation from her body,
sucking it out of her like a sponge.

350
00:25:46,523 --> 00:25:49,959
Draining her of her powers permanently.

351
00:25:50,043 --> 00:25:54,116
OK, so what do you need me for?
Why can't you just get her close to it?

352
00:25:54,203 --> 00:25:56,842
With that superhearing of hers?

353
00:25:56,923 --> 00:26:00,313
No, I need someone who can lure her to it.

354
00:26:00,403 --> 00:26:02,997
Someone who she has no cause to fear.

355
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:05,961
A weak and powerless simpleton.

356
00:26:06,043 --> 00:26:08,034
An idiot.

357
00:26:22,403 --> 00:26:27,875
<i>(Jenny) No, all of these invoices were
returned. None of them have been paid.</i>

358
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:30,318
Call back.

359
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:35,273
And these two are supposed to be...

360
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:42,074
Hi.

361
00:26:45,683 --> 00:26:46,638
Hi.

362
00:26:46,723 --> 00:26:47,997
What's this?

363
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:50,836
It's just a little something
I thought I'd bring by...

364
00:26:50,923 --> 00:26:52,595
- Flowers?
- Yeah.

365
00:26:52,683 --> 00:26:56,471
You think flowers
are going to make me forgive you?

366
00:26:56,563 --> 00:27:00,317
No. No, I do not think that.
I don't think that at all.

367
00:27:00,403 --> 00:27:03,600
Then what the hell are you doing here?

368
00:27:03,683 --> 00:27:10,282
OK, look. To be honest, I realise that
I've made the biggest mistake of my life.

369
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:16,552
I'm desperately in love with you and I'd
do anything for us to be together again.

370
00:27:21,963 --> 00:27:23,954
I would.

371
00:27:32,403 --> 00:27:34,314
Oh, God.

372
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,394
They're beautiful.

373
00:27:37,403 --> 00:27:38,995
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

374
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:42,041
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

375
00:27:42,123 --> 00:27:47,720
What do you think about today after work
you come by my place around seven

376
00:27:47,803 --> 00:27:53,673
- and I'll make us a nice dinner?
- Seven? I'd love to.

377
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,074
Matt?

378
00:28:23,043 --> 00:28:25,034
Matt?

379
00:28:28,323 --> 00:28:30,712
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, Jenny.

380
00:28:31,963 --> 00:28:34,079
Matt, it's beautiful.

381
00:28:34,163 --> 00:28:37,121
Oh, what is that? Is that for me?

382
00:28:37,203 --> 00:28:40,673
It is. It's a little something I got you cos...

383
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:44,119
I wanna apologise
for the terrible way that I've treated you.

384
00:28:44,203 --> 00:28:47,559
- Itjust wasn't right.
- You're so sweet. You didn't have to.

385
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,918
- It's true, I'm sorry.
- What is it?

386
00:28:50,003 --> 00:28:54,394
No peeking, OK? I want it
to be a surprise. Let's have a toast.

387
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,043
<i>(Jenny) You are amazing.</i>

388
00:28:57,123 --> 00:29:00,001
<i>(Matt) To second chances.</i>

389
00:29:01,003 --> 00:29:03,278
<i>(Jenny) To second chances.</i>

390
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:09,234
The man's not bad.
He might have a future in our business.

391
00:29:09,763 --> 00:29:11,958
You know, deep down,

392
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:16,559
I had a feeling that you'd realise
your mistake and come back to me.

393
00:29:16,643 --> 00:29:18,634
You are wise.

394
00:29:20,483 --> 00:29:23,361
- Do you wanna know a secret?
- Sure.

395
00:29:26,923 --> 00:29:29,437
That's why I didn't kill you.

396
00:29:29,523 --> 00:29:31,514
<i>(forced laugh)</i>

397
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,311
Matt?

398
00:29:54,403 --> 00:29:57,042
You are the sweetest guy I've ever met.

399
00:29:57,123 --> 00:30:00,035
- Oh, no, no, I'm not.
- Yes, yes, you are.

400
00:30:00,963 --> 00:30:03,477
You're sweet.

401
00:30:03,563 --> 00:30:05,554
Yummy.

402
00:30:06,803 --> 00:30:08,998
Matt?!

403
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,880
What are you doing here?

404
00:30:10,963 --> 00:30:13,431
Me?! What are you doing here?

405
00:30:13,523 --> 00:30:16,754
<i>You said your life was in danger.
And what's she doing here?</i>

406
00:30:16,843 --> 00:30:19,755
- Who's that? Do we know her?
- I don't know her.

407
00:30:19,843 --> 00:30:20,992
I don't know her.

408
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:26,111
You know how you tried to steal my
boyfriend by being such a big, fat whore?

409
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:28,717
- It didn't work.
- Jenny, stop. Let me handle this.

410
00:30:28,803 --> 00:30:30,202
- Are you back with her?
- No.

411
00:30:30,283 --> 00:30:32,274
- What?
- Yeah.

412
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,321
Look, it's very complicated, OK?

413
00:30:35,403 --> 00:30:38,122
How could you do this?
You told me you loved me.

414
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:41,036
Hannah, please, just do me a favour, OK?
Just leave.

415
00:30:41,123 --> 00:30:45,162
I mean, just try to have a little self-respect.
You're starting to look pathetic.

416
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:50,761
Matt! You are not... Oh, my God. There you
are. Thank God. I've been calling you all day.

417
00:30:50,843 --> 00:30:53,437
Playoff tickets. Amazing seats. You and me.

418
00:30:53,523 --> 00:30:56,117
- Not now.
- Tonight. Third base line. Yahoo!

419
00:30:56,203 --> 00:31:255,513
- Now is a terrible time, OK?
- Hey, what's in the box?

420
00:31:255,603 --> 00:31:04,074
- Stay away from that box.
- You know, Hannah,

421
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:08,042
why don't you just run along before I have
to kick your ass back to Munchkin Land?

422
00:31:08,123 --> 00:31:11,035
- Stay away from it.
- It looks big, it might be a nice present.

423
00:31:11,123 --> 00:31:14,911
- Are you threatening me?
- Push me one more time and you'll find out.

424
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:19,121
Oh, yeah? What are you going to do?
Squash me with your gigantic feet?

425
00:31:19,203 --> 00:31:21,922
- That's it!
- Don't touch me!

426
00:31:23,443 --> 00:31:27,561
Just do me a favour and leave
and take Hannah with you...

427
00:31:28,243 --> 00:31:31,553
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God! You're G-Girl.

428
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,398
You have been doing G-Girl?

429
00:31:35,283 --> 00:31:39,196
- Vaughn, open the box!
- Go! Go! Go! Watch the van!

430
00:31:40,883 --> 00:31:42,953
Open the damn box!

431
00:31:45,163 --> 00:31:46,482
Aargh!

432
00:31:46,563 --> 00:31:49,873
- It's not much of a present.
- Agh!

433
00:31:49,963 --> 00:31:51,954
I'm sorry.

434
00:31:54,563 --> 00:31:56,554
You bastard!

435
00:32:05,203 --> 00:32:07,922
Matt, that's a weird rock.

436
00:32:08,003 --> 00:32:09,322
Ah.

437
00:32:09,403 --> 00:32:13,362
A happy ending for everybody.
Well done, Mr Saunders.

438
00:32:13,443 --> 00:32:16,196
You did this? You helped him?

439
00:32:16,283 --> 00:32:20,595
I'm really sorry.
You did throw a shark at me, you know.

440
00:32:20,683 --> 00:32:24,358
Besides, Bedlam's gonna retire. It'll be OK.

441
00:32:25,323 --> 00:32:26,915
You idiot!

442
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:32,080
Looks like you're done, honey.

443
00:32:32,163 --> 00:32:36,759
You always thought
you were so much better than me.

444
00:32:36,843 --> 00:32:38,640
Now it's my turn.

445
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,874
Now I'll be the one with the powers.

446
00:32:41,963 --> 00:32:45,035
You'll be just plain old Jenny Johnson.

447
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:48,636
We're having a moment here.

448
00:32:50,243 --> 00:32:55,397
- Not so tough now, huh?!
- Hannah, don't let her touch the rock!

449
00:33:08,323 --> 00:33:10,553
Hannah!

450
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,682
Oh, no! Hannah!

451
00:33:16,403 --> 00:33:18,871
I can't even see her. We gotta get down there.

452
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,954
Oh, man!

453
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:23,839
I think she's dead, Matt.

454
00:33:23,923 --> 00:33:26,596
- I'm sorry. Let her go.
- We gotta dig her out!

455
00:33:26,683 --> 00:33:29,914
- We gotta start the grieving process.
- Are you crazy?

456
00:33:30,003 --> 00:33:32,471
- Come here. Give me a hug, bear cub.
- You!

457
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:36,997
I thought you were just ajerk!

458
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:39,358
Now I find out you're really stupid.

459
00:33:39,443 --> 00:33:41,593
Teaming up with Barry?!

460
00:33:47,963 --> 00:33:52,639
You broke my heart
and now I'm gonna break your everything.

461
00:33:56,283 --> 00:33:58,194
Hey!

462
00:33:58,283 --> 00:34:01,002
Let go of my boyfriend, you crazy bitch!

463
00:34:01,923 --> 00:34:04,437
Bring it!

464
00:34:09,403 --> 00:34:11,519
Oh, man!

465
00:34:11,603 --> 00:34:13,958
Yes, girl fight!

466
00:34:14,683 --> 00:34:16,480
Stupid!

467
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:19,479
Matt!

468
00:34:26,603 --> 00:34:28,594
No!

469
00:34:29,203 --> 00:34:30,955
Hannah!

470
00:34:31,043 --> 00:34:32,601
Hannah, are you OK?

471
00:34:33,523 --> 00:34:35,081
Oh, no!

472
00:34:41,923 --> 00:34:43,993
You rat!

473
00:34:47,123 --> 00:34:51,514
Oh, Matt. Matt, Matt, are you OK?

474
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,754
Uh-oh.

475
00:35:15,443 --> 00:35:17,434
Wow!

476
00:35:20,603 --> 00:35:22,878
Hannah, stop. Come on, stop.

477
00:35:22,963 --> 00:35:24,396
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

478
00:35:24,483 --> 00:35:27,555
I'm fine too. I thought I twinged my knee,
but I'm all right.

479
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:31,238
Come on. Forget about them. Let's go.

480
00:35:31,323 --> 00:35:33,473
Come on.

481
00:35:35,603 --> 00:35:38,993
They're gonna kill each other. This way.

482
00:35:41,003 --> 00:35:44,075
- Hey, it's you.
- Are you with them?

483
00:35:44,163 --> 00:35:46,154
As a matter of fact, I am.

484
00:35:47,203 --> 00:35:49,478
They went down there.

485
00:36:07,043 --> 00:36:09,511
Stop!

486
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:13,882
Look at yourself.
You're terrifying these people.

487
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:21,474
Jenny... Jenny,
this has gotta stop right now, OK?

488
00:36:21,563 --> 00:36:22,996
Please.

489
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:25,438
Just give me that, OK?

490
00:36:25,523 --> 00:36:27,957
There you go. Just give it to me.

491
00:36:28,043 --> 00:36:31,672
Wow. That was a lot heavier than I thought.

492
00:36:32,763 --> 00:36:34,799
Hi.

493
00:36:34,883 --> 00:36:39,513
Look, God knows
I don't want you mad at me, OK?

494
00:36:39,603 --> 00:36:42,037
And I'm sorry if I ever hurt you.

495
00:36:42,123 --> 00:36:46,036
And yeah, I know what we had
was something special.

496
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:48,353
And at times it was great.

497
00:36:48,443 --> 00:36:53,312
But it wasn't love, all right?
And deep down, you know that.

498
00:36:54,483 --> 00:37:255,682
You're a great girl.
And you deserve to be with the perfect guy.

499
00:37:255,763 --> 00:37:01,435
- You do.
- I do.

500
00:37:01,523 --> 00:37:06,722
And I know who the perfect guy for you is.
And he's here, right here, right now.

501
00:37:06,803 --> 00:37:08,794
Professor.

502
00:37:11,283 --> 00:37:13,513
- What?
- Barry?

503
00:37:14,363 --> 00:37:16,877
- Go on, Professor, tell her.
- Tell her what?

504
00:37:16,963 --> 00:37:19,716
She's my mortal enemy?
I want nothing but her destruction?

505
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:24,752
- Come on, Barry, please.
- Please stop calling me Barry.

506
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:28,472
It's true. This guy,
he's got a shrine to you in his house.

507
00:37:28,563 --> 00:37:32,158
There are pictures of you
all over the walls, just of you.

508
00:37:32,243 --> 00:37:35,599
This guy, he is hooked on you.
He really is.

509
00:37:36,523 --> 00:37:39,037
Is that true?

510
00:37:44,803 --> 00:37:49,957
Come on. You gotta open your heart to her.
It's now or never.

511
00:37:50,043 --> 00:37:52,796
It may be a little true.

512
00:37:54,803 --> 00:38:255,558
OK, OK, that's a good start.
Come on, Barry. Barry, come on.

513
00:38:255,643 --> 00:38:02,157
All right, all right!

514
00:38:02,243 --> 00:38:04,234
It's completely true.

515
00:38:05,723 --> 00:38:08,237
I love you.

516
00:38:08,323 --> 00:38:11,121
I've always loved you.

517
00:38:11,203 --> 00:38:15,594
But if you love me so much, then how come
you're always trying to hurt me?

518
00:38:15,683 --> 00:38:20,803
Because you hurt me. Because you
broke my heart into a billion pieces.

519
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:23,636
You ignored me.

520
00:38:23,723 --> 00:38:25,714
You left me behind.

521
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:33,240
So I thought if I had the powers,
you may learn to love me

522
00:38:33,323 --> 00:38:36,554
the way I have always loved you.

523
00:38:40,683 --> 00:38:42,674
Are you sure?

524
00:38:44,003 --> 00:38:46,119
Do you really love me?

525
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:52,233
Oh, yeah.

526
00:39:03,723 --> 00:39:06,635
It's over. Can you believe it?
I'm free. You were great.

527
00:39:06,723 --> 00:39:08,202
I can't believe that fight.

528
00:39:08,283 --> 00:39:11,241
I still think she'd kick my butt,
but I got a few good punches in.

529
00:39:11,323 --> 00:39:14,281
You saved my ass in there.
You were wonderful.

530
00:39:14,363 --> 00:39:17,400
And I'm really sorry
I didn't explain things to you sooner,

531
00:39:17,483 --> 00:39:21,874
- but I was just trying to protect you.
- I totally understand.

532
00:39:21,963 --> 00:39:23,032
Good.

533
00:39:23,123 --> 00:39:27,002
- Oh, my God, my hair.
- Oh, it doesn't look that bad. You can fix it.

534
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:28,960
Here, try this on.

535
00:39:29,043 --> 00:39:30,840
Thanks.

536
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:34,597
See? Adorable.

537
00:39:34,683 --> 00:39:36,878
- Yes, you are.
- No, not me.

538
00:39:36,963 --> 00:39:39,636
- Come here.
- Agh!

539
00:39:39,723 --> 00:39:41,395
- Tight.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

540
00:39:41,483 --> 00:39:45,032
- It's OK.
- I'm still getting used to all of this.

541
00:39:45,123 --> 00:39:50,880
You and me both. And you know, we're going
to have to talk about the relationship too.

542
00:39:50,963 --> 00:39:54,672
- Talk? You mean...
- Your powers.

543
00:39:54,763 --> 00:40:255,439
Just cos you have 'em doesn't mean
you have to use 'em, you know what I mean?

544
00:40:255,523 --> 00:40:02,515
You're a little scared of me.

545
00:40:02,603 --> 00:40:05,401
What? Scared?
No, come on, I'm not scared at all.

546
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:07,474
Come here.

547
00:40:16,203 --> 00:40:18,000
Are you ready?

548
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:22,201
Yeah! I am. I'm ready.

549
00:40:22,283 --> 00:40:24,797
OK. Here we go.

550
00:40:29,163 --> 00:40:31,358
OK, all right, I got it.

551
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:42,440
- Hold on, I think I tweaked something.
- Oh, you poor baby.

552
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:54,279
What the hell were you doing?!

553
00:40:56,363 --> 00:40:58,479
Sorry. Sorry.

554
00:41:10,283 --> 00:41:12,433
Oh.

555
00:41:12,523 --> 00:41:16,038
I brought it down for you.
Peace offering.

556
00:41:20,723 --> 00:41:23,681
You've done so much for us.
We couldn't be happier.

557
00:41:23,763 --> 00:41:26,231
- How...? How...?
- Asteroids.

558
00:41:26,323 --> 00:41:29,554
Most of that will just buff right out.

559
00:41:34,043 --> 00:41:36,637
- I'll fix that.
- I could trick it out for you.

560
00:41:36,723 --> 00:41:40,079
Rocket launchers, laser cannons,
voice-activated battle armour.

561
00:41:40,163 --> 00:41:42,313
<i>- (police radio)
- Do you hear something?</i>

562
00:41:42,403 --> 00:41:44,758
- No.
- There's a 747 in trouble.

563
00:41:44,843 --> 00:41:47,437
It's a 727. Time to go to work.

564
00:41:48,403 --> 00:41:50,792
You need a hand?

565
00:41:51,723 --> 00:41:54,112
- A hand?
- Yeah, any help?

566
00:41:55,123 --> 00:41:57,796
I never had any help.

567
00:41:57,883 --> 00:42:00,351
- Could be some heavy lifting.
- Yeah?

568
00:42:00,443 --> 00:42:02,240
- OK.
- Yeah? Really?

569
00:42:02,323 --> 00:42:05,952
- Yes.
- Yes! All right! Whoo!

570
00:42:08,003 --> 00:42:10,358
OK, ready. Whoo! Here I go.

571
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:20,040
Yeah!

572
00:42:20,923 --> 00:42:23,801
- Love you, honey!
- We'll be waiting!

573
00:42:25,563 --> 00:42:29,602
What are we gonna do with this stuff?
Wanna get a beer?

574
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:31,753
- Sure.
- Let's do it.

Yeah. Well, it helps

in two years, three months,
