1
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,175
Isn't the air nice, Tatsuo?

2
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,177
You'll get used to it here soon

3
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,637
I'm sure you'll make good friends here

4
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,535
It's Jun-shik!

5
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,667
I'm faster than a car!

6
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,518
Grandpa!

7
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:55,194
You show the signs of
a great imperial soldier already

8
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,447
Welcome, my boy

9
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,331
How've you been, Father?

10
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:11,794
Greet them

11
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,505
He's the new, young master

12
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,007
Jun-shik Kim, sir

13
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,884
I'm Eun-soo Kim, sir

14
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,719
Great, Tatsuo

15
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,472
You have a new friend your age

16
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:27,476
Tatsuo runs well. Like you

17
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:32,022
My brother's the best runner
in Kyung-sung, sir

18
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:35,359
I'm the best in Tokyo

19
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,362
No match for a country boy

20
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:41,323
Wanna race me?

21
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,162
Ready

22
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,126
Go!

23
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:11,562
Hasegawa beat Korea's Jun-shik Kim
in the 4th high school marathons!

24
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:16,817
Korea's son, Jun-shik Kim,
beat Hasegawa Tatsuo and won!

25
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:22,823
"HASEGAWA TATSUO
WINS NATIONAL MARATHONS AGAIN!"

26
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,243
"KIM JUN-SHIK WINS!"

27
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,628
Congratulations

28
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:41,800
Jun-shik Kim,
the light of Korean marathon

29
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:46,347
Hasegawa Tatsuo,
the star of Japanese marathon wins again

30
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,316
Good job chasing behind me

31
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,568
Must be your damn lucky day

32
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:09,995
Let's applaud Hasegawa Tatsuo

33
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,124
who won the national
high school marathon

34
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,127
and brought great honor
to Imperial Japan

35
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,386
Long live our Emperor!

36
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:28,097
Long live Imperial Japan!

37
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:33,310
Long live...

38
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:36,188
This is my grandson, Tatsuo

39
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,949
You must be very proud

40
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,910
I expect a lot from you

41
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,704
Thank you

42
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,673
It's a gift
from the Japanese Minister of Defense

43
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,136
Open it

44
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,679
Yes, sir

45
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:21,358
Give me that!

46
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:25,237
Get away!

47
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,038
Grandfather! Grandfather!

48
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:39,209
- Father!
- Grandfather! Grandfather!

49
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,379
Do something! Father, please!
Do something!

50
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,841
You're a doctor who saves lives!

51
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,802
Why aren't you doing anything?

52
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,020
- You killed him!
- No

53
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,313
You killed him!

54
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:00,105
No

55
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,649
Bring my grandfather back!

56
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:03,901
Let go!

57
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,736
He didn't kill anyone!

58
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:08,947
You bastards killed him!

59
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:09,615
Jun-shik!

60
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,950
Bring my grandfather back!

61
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:12,826
No!

62
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,161
- Daddy!
- No! I didn't do it!

63
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,997
Daddy!

64
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,165
- Jun-shik!
- Daddy!

65
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:18,874
Father!

66
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,876
Bring my grandfather back!

67
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,377
Father!

68
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:23,003
Jun-shik

69
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:23,962
Bring my grandfather back!

70
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,006
Let Go!

71
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,759
- Father! Father!
- Daddy... Daddy

72
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,979
Don't show your face around here again

73
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,900
Or I might kill you

74
00:08:55,744 --> 00:09:07,714
Korea's hero, Ki-jung Sohn
won an Olympic gold medal! Rejoice!

75
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:28,193
MAY, 1938, KYUNG-SUNG, KOREA

76
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:33,615
Why do you have sandbags strapped on?

77
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,077
Are you a marathon runner?

78
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:42,708
Korea's luck in the marathon
stops with Ki-jung Sohn

79
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:47,421
A Korean man will never be
an Olympic victor again

80
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,090
Koreans are banned from Olympics

81
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,719
'cause Sohn covered the Japanese flag?

82
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,304
If you were a bomb,

83
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,056
I'd run straight
into the Athletics Association

84
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:03,353
Marathon running is a science demanding
concentration and fighting spirit

85
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,690
I'll prove it once and for all
at the Olympic tryouts

86
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,775
Can you go any faster?

87
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,818
You might regret it

88
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,612
I'll pay double
if you get there in 30 minutes

89
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:14,114
Triple for 20 minutes

90
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,324
Hold on tight

91
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,201
Your victory in the tryouts is a given

92
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:20,120
What is your goal in the Olympics?

93
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,790
I'll win the gold and set a new record

94
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:27,377
- What a laugh?
- In honor of our great empire!

95
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:29,963
Look out!

96
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,549
Look out!

97
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,802
Let's go! Coming through!

98
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,271
Move! Out of the way!

99
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,193
To a marathon gold medal
at the Tokyo Olympics!

100
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,695
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

101
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,641
You're quite the runner

102
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,559
Here you are

103
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,979
Double would've been fine

104
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,316
Opportunities come to those
who don't give up

105
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,901
Jun-shik Kim

106
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,366
Jun-shik!

107
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:52,170
Are you okay?

108
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,840
Isn't that...

109
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:02,556
Are you all so happy
over half of a race?

110
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,229
I'm Ki-jung Sohn

111
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,647
Ki-jung Sohn's in Japan

112
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:14,109
Wanna bet?
If I win, I get to marry your sister

113
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:14,943
Hurry

114
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:21,575
You say Japan and Korea are one
yet you ban Koreans from tryouts?

115
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,453
Are you claiming
the Athletics Association is unjust?

116
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,413
Your comment, Mr. Chairman?

117
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,915
The board has decided

118
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,879
If a Japanese runner will win anyways,
what's the problem?

119
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:38,592
It'll be boring for Hasegawa
without Jun-shik Kim

120
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,762
I think Jun-shik Kim
shouldn't be in the discussion

121
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:42,763
See!

122
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,431
Jun-shik Kim?

123
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,232
Jun-shik

124
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,818
Jun-shik Kim, what have you been up to?

125
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,280
What are your thoughts on the ban
on Korean runners?

126
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,573
Are you still training?

127
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,576
How much do you train each day?
Your comments, please

128
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,494
Mr. Hasegawa?

129
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:09,122
Are you confident you'll win
even if Jun-shik Kim enters?

130
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:13,084
You think he stands a chance against me?

131
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,755
But aren't Jun-shik Kim's records better
than yours?

132
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,882
That was in the past

133
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:24,971
You think a mere rickshaw driver
can beat a well-trained marathoner?

134
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,140
If you could enter,

135
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,851
are you confident you can beat Hasegawa?

136
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:34,147
How good can a mere rickshaw driver be?

137
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:38,944
I'd be grateful just to enter the race

138
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,868
Here is your acceptance letter
from Berlin Medical University

139
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,328
Sign it

140
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,874
The marathon is more important to me
than my studies

141
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,419
This is the most important period
in your life

142
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,463
Focus on your studies

143
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:07,222
Our men are sacrificing their lives
to build a Greater East Asia

144
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,977
I don't want to be a coward
who runs away from war

145
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:16,481
War is futile

146
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,984
You are insulting Grandfather

147
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:22,571
Tatsuo, watch what you say

148
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:27,117
Think of the people before your country

149
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,035
That's the way of a doctor

150
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:34,833
Then I must treat the Korean people
who killed my grandfather?

151
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,711
Even if it kills me, I'll never do that

152
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:44,634
The picture is missing from the frame
in my room

153
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,470
Jong-dae! Why you

154
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,806
Why would someone steal
a picture of all things?

155
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,183
It should be around somewhere

156
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:55,395
Anyway, I hope you can enter the tryouts

157
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,147
Father will be so happy

158
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,315
Don't get your hopes up

159
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,775
Can't trust the Japs

160
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,987
Get more firewood. The fire's dying

161
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,072
Please?

162
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,168
It's so pretty

163
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,424
How do I look?

164
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,800
Eun-soo

165
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:30,263
I think you're the prettiest girl
in all of Asia

166

00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,836
Please win and bring hope to Korea again

168
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,924
I can really enter the race?

169
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:11,805
Show them how scary
a mere rickshaw driver can be!

170
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,848
Jun-shik

171
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,102
Listen carefully

172
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:20,146
The man in front of Jun-shik
is Ki-jung Sohn

173
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:24,025
Then, you must be holding
the Olympic tryouts entry form

174
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,236
If I'm right, hold it up high!

175
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,155
Yes!

176
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:30,907
Let me see!

177
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,410
Yes!

178
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,707
Sir! Sir!

179
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:41,459
Jun-shik!

180
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,714
Min-woo! Everyone!

181
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,551
Korea's best marathoner, Jun-shik Kim,

182
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,302
will run the marathon again!

183
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:54,222
Hurray for Jun-shik Kim! Hurray!

184
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:58,435
Jun-shik Kim! Jun-shik Kim!

185
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:06,568
Get the rice cake kings ate!
Rice cakes here!

186
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,154
Here you are

187
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,372
Father picked it out himself

188
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,082
The best pair there is

189
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,884
Promise you'll win the race today?

190
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,848
Tatsuo

191
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:41,394
Your father will be here soon!

192
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:52,655
Look

193
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:58,203
Let's relieve
all our Korean folks' heartaches today!

194
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:03,958
Jun-shik Kim! Jun-shik Kim!

195
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,543
Act according to the plans.

196
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,255
Runners to the starting line!

197
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,152
You can do it!

198
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,865
And they're off!

199
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,826
Tatsuo!

200
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,288
Go, Jun-shik

201
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:51,798
Tatsuo, go get 'em!

202
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,401
Hasegawa! Faster! Faster!

203
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:13,611
Jun-shik, you're halfway there!

204
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:17,282
Don't mind Jun-shik Kim

205
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,472
Hasegawa! Spurt ahead!

206
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,266
Spurt ahead!

207
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,606
Hasegawa!

208
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,449
The runners will come
into the stadium any minute!

209
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,117
Why are you so late?

210
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,702
A surgery took long

211
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,495
What a tense moment!

212
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,081
There! The runners can be finally seen!

213
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:11,419
Who is the first runner coming in?
Who will it be?

214
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:18,009
As expected,
it's Hasegawa with Kimura behind him!

215
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:25,892
What? There's another runner!
It's Jun-shik Kim!

216
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,102
You can do it

217
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,479
Jun-shik

218
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:34,525
Jun-shik Kim!

219
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,736
Go, Jun-shik!

220
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,241
Kimura! Kimura!

221
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,831
Hey! What's that bastard doing!

222
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:07,183
Jun-shik!

223
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,479
Jun-shik!

224
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,400
Tatsuo!

225
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,620
Jun-shik!

226
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:40,383
Jun-shik! The rickshaw won!

227
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:43,011
Jun-shik Kim! Hurray!

228
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,227
Jun-shik Kim!

229
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:01,696
The last runner is coming in!

230
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,240
It's a dream come true!

231
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:07,243
The medals will be awarded soon

232
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,871
I knew you could do it!

233
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:20,048
Ladies and gentlemen,
the results will now be announced

234
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:23,676
The winner of All Japan Olympic
Marathon Tryouts is

235
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:28,389
Hasegawa Tatsuo!

236
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,601
Second is number 13, Ando!

237
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:33,978
Third is number 18, Kimura!

238
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:37,774
Will the three runners
come up to the victory stand?

239
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:40,693
Hasegawa, Ando, and Kimura

240
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,071
Please come to the victory stand

241
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,990
- Jun-shik Kim was first!
- What's he saying?

242
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:53,915
Jun-shik Kim!

243
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,211
Spectators,
please calm down and be seated

244
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:03,800
Jun-shik Kim has been disqualified
for blocking Kimura's way

245
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:07,220
Disqualified? How!

246
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,431
Jun-shik

247
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,183
Jun-shik

248
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,898
Is this why you let me enter?

249
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:22,193
Go back. Didn't you hear
you've been disqualified?

250
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:25,696
You should've run fair and square

251
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,448
Fair and square?

252
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,409
Crazy bastards

253
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,161
Try Saying it again!

254
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:40,837
Jun-shik!

255
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:43,172
Jun-shik!

256
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,009
Jun-shik!

257
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,220
Damn bastards!

258
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:58,813
Damn bastards!

259
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:01,399
Jong-dae!

260
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:19,292
Hasegawa!
Please come up to the victory stand,

261
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:20,877
immediately!

262
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:25,590
The winner of the Olympic tryouts
is Jun-shik Kim!

263
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:29,343
Hasegawa, Ando, and Kimura!

264
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:32,805
Please come up, immediately!

265
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,940
You bastards cheated first!

266
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:54,702
Tatsuo!

267
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,121
Tatsuo!

268
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:04,795
This court has decided
on the following sentence

269
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:08,299
Based on section 4 of the legal code,

270
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:12,011
all accomplices of the riot

271
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:16,182
will become Imperial soldiers

272
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:20,770
and swear allegiance to the Emperor

273
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:24,440
Mother!

274
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:27,944
Mother!

275
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:29,946
I didn't do anything!

276
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:31,322
Jun-shik!

277
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,826
Jun-shik!

278
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:40,081
Jun-shik!

279
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,627
Jun-shik!

280
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:46,796
Eun-soo!

281
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:48,506
Jun-shik!

282
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,383
Father!

283
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,052
Father!

284
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,930
Jun-shik!

285
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:03,938
Soldiers must behave with decorum

286
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,481
Stop mumbling!

287
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:09,110
Soldiers must
always improve their battle skills

288
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:09,735
I don't believe this

289
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,947
Soldiers must
always improve their battle skills

290
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:19,495
Soldiers must serve with utmost loyalty

291
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:25,251
Soldiers must always be frugal

292
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,544
Frugal...

293
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,341
"JULY, 1939,
NOMONHAN, MONGOLIAN BORDERLAND"

294
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,735
Retreat!

295
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,237
Everyone retreat!

296
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:10,588
That Way!

297
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:23,851
Concentrate!

298
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,227
Get up there!

299
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,698
Retreat!

300
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,050
Min-woo!

301
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,808
You okay? It's me, Jun-shik

302
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:04,975
Wake up!

303
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:03,492
Shit. I should've fought
for independence instead

304
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:07,997
Who would've guessed we'd end up
fighting for the Japs here?

305
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:10,666
Our damn fortunes

306
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:12,835
I'm starving to death

307
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,504
You're hungry 24 hours a day

308
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:17,631
Grow up will you?

309
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:21,010
Hey! Hurry up!

310
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,387
Lazy Korean fools!

311
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,306
Yes, sir

312
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:26,557
Let's hurry

313
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,060
Hope you get shot down dead

314
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,955
He's really dead?

315
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,208
- Choon-bok! Your butt!
- What?

316
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,389
Where's it coming from?

317
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:09,433
I almost got my head blown off

318
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,105
The broken wall at 1 o'clock

319
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:20,402
I heard the 1st regiment
got attacked, too. It's him

320
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,196
Just our damn luck

321
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,448
Jong-dae! Cover me

322
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:25,658
No! Stay back, Jun-shik!

323
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:26,784
Cover him!

324
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:30,454
Choon-bok! Cover him!

325
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,805
Are you okay Jun-shik?

326
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:22,441
It's great you shot down just Japs,
but Noda's gonna kill us

327
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:26,153
She killed so many

328
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:30,115
Hey! Don't hog all the food!
Give me some

329
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,951
Don't slobber over it!

330
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,243
Give me some!

331
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:37,206
This is you?

332
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:44,254
You keep eating. I'll look at this

333
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:48,008
Fine, I'll show you. Let me see first

334
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,222
Not that sexy

335
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:55,099
She's crying

336
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,725
Coz you took her picture

337
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,228
No, it's coz you ate all her beef jerky

338
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,898
Fools. Why'd you make her cry?

339
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:12,157
The bullets happened to swerve
and hit only Japanese soldiers?

340
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:16,662
Did the bitch smell

341
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,708
your Kimchi breath? Talk, you fools!

342
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,042
Speak, you bastards!

343
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,838
Who sent you here! Say it!

344
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:32,553
I'm Shirai from Hailaer

345
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:37,850
You raped my mother before my father,
and raped me, too

346
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:39,727
Listen!

347
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:42,896
There are many like me in China

348
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:45,232
China will never lose to you!

349
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:51,280
I will never forgive! Never!

350
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:59,705
Tell me! Why did the bullets
fly past you Korean rubbish!

351
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,665
Speak, you bastards!

352
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,584
Damn it! Stop it!

353
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:09,965
I said no speaking Korean!

354
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,300
Enough

355
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:18,432
That won't bring back the dead!

356
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,310
Go back to your work places

357
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,801
What's all this? Who's coming?

358
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:57,763
Colonel

359
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:01,767
I'm Colonel Takakura

360
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:13,737
Company, halt!

361
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,366
Attention!

362
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,623
What? Why's that bastard here?

363
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,044
Colonel Hasegawa, what brings you here?

364
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:35,884
Private Takakura ever drive past
honorable Imperial soldiers' corpses?

365
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,010
Mukai!

366
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:38,345
Yes, sir

367
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:40,681
First!

368
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:45,519
For shamefully ordering a retreat,

369
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,397
you're demoted to private as of today

370
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:49,148
Second

371
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:55,445
Private Takakura will prove loyalty
to our Emperor and commit hara-kiri!

372
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:01,034
Be thankful our Emperor
granted you an honorable death!

373
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:17,467
Long live our Emperor!

374
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,355
Handle the deceased with due respect

375
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,148
Yes, sir

376
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:33,567
Remember, after feeding off corpses,

377
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:37,362
crows can come and gouge out your eyes

378
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,948
I'm Hasegawa Tatsuo

379
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,750
I came here to demolish

380
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,753
Soviet tanks!

381
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:58,175
I'll show them true power
of the Imperial army!

382
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:02,846
When out of bullets, Imperial soldiers
must charge with bayonets!

383
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:09,019
If bayonets are broken,
we must fight with bare hands!

384
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:13,815
Imperial soldiers do not leave
the battlefield till death!

385
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:14,733
Understood!

386
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:15,400
Yes, sir

387
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:18,111
We either win or die

388
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:20,155
First!

389
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,202
We'll build a pontoon bridge
over Khalkhin River within 48 hours

390
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:26,370
Second!

391
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:30,415
We'll form a special suicide unit
of 50 men to demolish tanks

392
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:35,921
All officers will stand with me
at the vanguard of the special unit!

393
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:36,922
Mukai!

394
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:37,506
Yes, sir!

395
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:40,592
Write up the list and have it
on my desk by tomorrow

396
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:41,635
Dismissed!

397
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,054
Dismissed!

398
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,805
I'm sorry about your picture

399
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:29,141
I glued it together

400
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,268
Take it

401
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,457
I have a sister like you back home

402
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:57,794
My name is Jun-shik Kim

403
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:12,851
Thank you

404
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,568
"Shei-shei ni"?

405
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:27,866
The sun's going down!
Hurry up, you bastards!

406
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,118
Stop dawdling!

407
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:32,996
Hurry up! Work harder!

408
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,541
When the sun goes down, it's over!

409
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,794
Squad 9!

410
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:42,547
Damn slow Korean dogs!

411
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,425
Build this in 2 days? He's insane!

412
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,220
They worked us from dawn!
Where's the food!

413
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:50,639
Stop talking about food!

414
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:52,432
You're making me hungry

415
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,353
Choon-bok? What's "Shei-shei ni"?

416
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,397
Learning Chinese?

417
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:00,816
Why do you keep asking?

418
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:02,234
Just tell me

419
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:03,944
It means thank you

420
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,156
Stop working!

421
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,370
Attention!

422
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:23,463
At ease

423
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:27,843
I heard Tatsuo was your marathon rival

424
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:29,344
He didn't stand a chance

425
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:31,513
Jun-shik's way better!

426
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:35,100
Come out!

427
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:38,520
Keep that in your mouth and come out!

428
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,314
Choon-bok Hwang!

429
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:47,904
Come out faster than a bullet,
or you'll drink all the water here!

430
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:56,288
Repeat after me

431
00:40:56,788 --> 00:41:02,252
I'm a barbarian

432
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:09,676
I'm a Korean

433
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:15,640
Repeat that, keep the fish in,
and do squats till sundown!

434
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:16,933
Begin!

435
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:38,663
Catching fish on duty
or running during bedtime!

436
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:42,459
You think this is a playground?

437
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:51,009
Make sure everything gets incinerated

438
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:52,469
Yes, sir!

439
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:55,597
No!

440
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:58,558
How dare you!

441
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:01,019
Not my running shoes!

442
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:04,064
Oh, is that so?

443
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,775
If you wanna run, do it barefoot

444
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,366
Where are you going, fool!

445
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:16,076
Damn bastards!

446
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:19,538
How many more beatings you need!
Korean dog!

447
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:23,959
No!

448
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:49,693
Gwang-choon? This side's sinking

449
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,653
What? There's a screw lose

450
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:53,071
Who unscrewed this?

451
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:54,864
It was there before

452
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,021
Squad 9! Step forward

453
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:33,278
If we went on like this tomorrow,

454
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:35,238
what would've happened?

455
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:40,619
From now on, the engineering unit
will fix up Squad 9's area

456
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:45,790
Squad 9 will hold the faulty
plank on their heads

457
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:49,878
And return to the base before sundown

458
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:54,674
The best marathoner will be leading you

459
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:04,017
The plank must be leveled!
Keep it leveled!

460
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,060
Noda, the bastard!

461
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:06,853
Save your breath

462
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,730
Just walk, Jun-shik
We'll hold up the plank

463
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:09,689
Don't worry

464
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:12,025
If you hurt your knee,
it's over! Listen!

465
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,360
Keep it leveled!

466
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:15,487
One! Two!

467
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:18,865
How is it? Cool enough for you

468
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,201
Squad 9 Sluggards!

469
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:39,218
John Yushe.

470
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:40,803
Yes sir.

471
00:44:40,804 --> 00:44:41,930
Yueh Sanchin.

472
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:42,638
Yes sir.

473
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:43,640
Jong-dae Lee!

474
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:45,016
Yes, sir

475
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:46,601
Jun-shik Kim!

476
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:47,727
Yes, sir

477
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:54,067
Why're they calling us this time?

478
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,402
Attention!

479
00:44:56,861 --> 00:45:00,990
The 50 soldiers called will fight
in tomorrow's attack

480
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:03,952
On a special suicide mission with me

481
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:06,830
What did he say? Suicide? Us?

482
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:11,543
We will carry bombs
and demolish enemy tanks at dawn

483
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:14,838
Fight like Imperial soldiers
and die with honor

484
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:18,508
I'll kill anyone. Who dares retreat

485
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:25,682
Koreans should be honored to be
included in this heroic mission

486
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:32,313
I'm not taking part in this operation

487
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,655
Oh, really?

488
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:43,783
For what reason?

489
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:48,455
The Korean soldiers
and I didn't volunteer

490
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:52,250
we cannot consent to
a mission that demands death

491
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:55,670
Your permission to shoot, sir!

492
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:57,380
Dare disobey me?

493
00:45:57,505 --> 00:46:03,428
All Koreans here, including our squad,

494
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:05,972
think the same

495
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:08,683
I'll ask again

496
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,143
Are you disobeying me?

497
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:12,312
This is insane

498
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:22,090
Execute him with the other POWs!

499
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:27,929
Before we march out tomorrow

500
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:44,445
Have fun on your last night

501
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,034
Stupid bastards!

502
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:03,381
Are you okay?

503
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:12,891
I'll be executed at dawn

504
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:16,561
Like this

505
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,863
The Japanese are evil

506
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:32,911
Korea and China are foolish

507
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:35,747
I'm not afraid to die

508
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:39,500
I'm just mad
I couldn't kill more Japanese fools

509
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:43,379
If I could, I'd get more revenge

510
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:48,301
I'd kill them all!

511
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:07,403
What are you doing?

512
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:11,658
If we're gonna die like dogs,
might as well save Jun-shik!

513
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:12,825
Hurry UP

514
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:14,661
Hurry!

515
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:17,372
Shirai

516
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:19,791
Why her?

517
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:21,209
Pull her out!

518
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:24,754
Why? At a time like this

519
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,547
It's coming!

520
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:38,893
Run!

521
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,029
Get down!

522
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,377
Jun-shik!

523
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:23,604
Let's head to the bridge and go south

524
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,064
on Khalkin River to cross the border

525
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:27,233
Where's Min-woo?
We're the only ones going?

526
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:28,735
He's out on a job with Noda

527
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:32,238
We can't take all 100 Koreans with us

528
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:33,489
Let's hurry

529
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:35,825
We don't have time. Come on.

530
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:13,112
Jun-shik!

531
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:15,656
Get on

532
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,451
Jun-shik! Jun-shik!

533
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:21,829
Jun-shik!

534
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:31,756
What's that?

535
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:34,675
It's an attack!

536
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:36,886
We could've gotten killed, too

537
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,846
Damn Japs! Good for them!

538
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:40,890
Let's go! Come on,

539
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:44,769
Jun-shik! Hurry up!

540
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:46,312
What's going on?

541
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,189
Soviet tanks are coming! Grab the oar!

542
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:49,398
Tanks?

543
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,652
Get on!

544
00:51:52,777 --> 00:51:53,778
Jun-shik!

545
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:55,029
The tanks are coming!

546
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:56,823
Get on!

547
00:51:56,948 --> 00:51:58,908
Go ahead without me

548
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,493
What did you say?

549
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,873
What the hell are you doing!

550
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:07,416
Crazy?

551
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:08,501
Get on, Jun-shik! Come on!

552
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,878
What the hell are you doing!

553
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,004
Come with us!

554
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:13,089
Let's all survive and meet again!

555
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:15,174
Jun-shik! Are you crazy?

556
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:17,009
Are you crazy?

557
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:19,095
Just get on!

558
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,680
If you go back, you're dead, too!

559
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:23,224
Come back! Jun-shik!

560
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,225
Jun-shik!

561
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,810
Jun-shik Kim!

562
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:21,157
Jun-shik!

563
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:23,492
Jun-shik!

564
00:53:23,618 --> 00:53:24,952
Shirai!

565
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:28,539
Watch out!

566
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:36,005
Watch out!

567
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:39,717
Shirai is an ace shooter

568
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:51,687
Shirai!

569
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:05,243
Shirai!

570
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:11,249
Shirai!

571
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:13,876
Shirai!

572
00:54:16,045 --> 00:54:17,505
Shirai!

573
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,133
Hurry.

574
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:31,519
Go save your friends

575
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:35,731
Thank you.

576
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:15,021
Stop!

577
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:18,899
Don't come!

578
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:20,943
Stop!

579
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:26,657
Stop!

580
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:37,585
It's an attack!

581
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:40,880
Don't come!

582
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,014
It's an attack, sir!

583
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:53,601
Get ready for battle!

584
00:55:53,726 --> 00:55:55,478
Block off the front with trucks!

585
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:57,605
Move the trucks up front!

586
00:55:58,439 --> 00:56:02,068
The rest to the first line of defense!

587
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:09,241
To the first line of defense!

588
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:19,126
Defend the first line of defense!

589
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,476
To the first line of defense!

590
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,747
Charge!

591
00:57:49,592 --> 00:57:51,886
Scatter!

592
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:14,325
Long live our Emperor!

593
00:59:00,496 --> 00:59:03,249
Long live our Emperor!

594
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:39,159
Die bravely like
a special suicide unit member!

595
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:46,333
You son of a bitch!

596
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:47,710
Min-woo! It's okay

597
00:59:55,426 --> 00:59:57,386
You go and die bravely!

598
01:00:03,726 --> 01:00:04,810
Min-woo!

599
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:11,400
Help me

600
01:00:18,407 --> 01:00:19,575
Min-woo

601
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:24,872
Min-woo

602
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,061
Fools!

603
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,064
Imperial soldier don't retreat!

604
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:34,525
How dare you run away!

605
01:01:37,403 --> 01:01:39,196
Charge!

606
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:41,865
Don't show your back to the enemy!

607
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:45,786
Don't back away!

608
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:47,329
Charge!

609
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:50,082
Charge!

610
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:54,294
Don't back down!

611
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:58,757
Don't run! Fight! Charge!

612
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:13,981
Want to get everyone killed?

613
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:16,483
If you want to die, do it alone!

614
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:19,278
We're not dying like dogs!

615
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:21,655
Order the retreat!

616
01:02:22,698 --> 01:02:27,161
Imperial soldiers must charge ahead
even as ghosts!

617
01:02:27,745 --> 01:02:31,707
Enough with the Imperial soldiers!

618
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:33,375
Order the retreat!

619
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,713
Colonel!

620
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:53,812
Here's your chance to die honorably
as an Imperial soldier!

621
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:04,823
Long live our Emperor!

622
01:03:05,616 --> 01:03:12,664
Long live Imperial Japan!

623
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:48,325
Where are we going?

624
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:52,412
Can we make it back home?

625
01:04:01,088 --> 01:04:03,090
Hurry UP!

626
01:04:03,215 --> 01:04:05,551
Move it! You bastards!

627
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:25,112
"CHITA"

628
01:04:29,992 --> 01:04:34,913
"OMSK"

629
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:42,462
"PERM"

630
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,843
"FEBRUARY, 1940, KUNGURSK,
SOVIET UNION PRISONER OF WAR CAMP"

631
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:59,730
We are not prisoners of war,
but criminals who started war

632
01:04:59,855 --> 01:05:14,745
We'll repay our debts to Soviet Union
with dedicated labor and reform

633
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:25,088
As proof you'll carry out the oath

634
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:27,466
The leader of you Japanese dogs,

635
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:35,849
Hasegawa Tatsuo,
must step on your national flag

636
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:54,076
We're not labors or criminals,

637
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:57,955
but proud Imperial soldiers!

638
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:01,917
You have no right to force us to reform!

639
01:06:04,336 --> 01:06:08,006
Imperial Japan will not abandon you!

640
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:11,677
Keep your dignity till the day

641
01:06:11,802 --> 01:06:14,221
you return and fight with honor!

642
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:20,227
Long live our Emperor!

643
01:06:20,352 --> 01:06:24,022
Long live Imperial Japan!

644
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:48,463
Hurry up! Move it!

645
01:06:54,052 --> 01:06:55,971
Walk in a line!

646
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:14,531
Colonel! Don't fall asleep, sir!

647
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,575
Shut up, fool! Keep moving!

648
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:23,415
Hurry up! You yellow bastards!

649
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:30,505
You slow sluggards!

650
01:07:36,178 --> 01:07:37,304
Newcomers to the left!

651
01:07:37,429 --> 01:07:38,513
Old maggots to the right!

652
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:39,973
Hurry!

653
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:45,353
Line up, you bastards!

654
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:47,439
Newcomers to the left!

655
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:50,317
Old maggots to the right!

Gwang-choon!

658
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:03,580
- Jun-shik!
- Jun-shik!

659
01:08:08,085 --> 01:08:09,753
I thought you were dead!

660
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:13,298
What a relief you're all alive

661
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:14,591
Where's Jong-dae?

662
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:17,010
Jong-dae's here, but

663
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:17,928
Attention!

664
01:08:18,053 --> 01:08:20,847
This is Anton, your supervisor

665
01:08:32,901 --> 01:08:34,778
I'm Anton

666
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:40,534
If Area 3 doesn't shape up,
it'll be hard to stay alive here

667
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:43,161
Officers or soldiers,

668
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:45,580
I won't tolerate anyone
slacking on the job!

669
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:49,668
Each group leader, take 20 new POWs

670
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:51,753
and go to your work areas!

671
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:52,963
Go!

672
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:59,928
Jong-dae!

673
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:01,680
Jun-shik!

674
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:06,685
You're alive!

675
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:09,521
I was so worried
I'd never see you again

676
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:10,230
Are you okay?

677
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:12,107
I'm fine. When did you get here?

678
01:09:12,232 --> 01:09:13,608
About two months ago

679
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:15,569
I rule here

680
01:09:15,694 --> 01:09:17,737
Nothing for you to worry about now

681
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:23,785
Korean dog! Jong-dae Lee!

682
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:30,292
I didn't like the way you were talking

683
01:09:30,417 --> 01:09:31,585
I'm sorry...

684
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:35,380
Thought I'd say that?

685
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:36,548
You damn Jap!

686
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:40,010
Dare call me a Korean dog?

687
01:09:40,135 --> 01:09:41,136
Give me that

688
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:44,514
Still think I'm a damn soldier
under you?

689
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:48,977
You stupid son of a bitch!

690
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:56,985
This isn't Kyung-sung or Nomonhan!

691
01:09:57,110 --> 01:10:03,408
This is the great
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!

692
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:06,286
I'm the colonel here!

693
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:08,205
And I'm the king!

694
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:09,873
You got that, fool?

695
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:13,126
You got that, fool?

696
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:19,549
Got that, you damn Japs!

697
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:30,435
Colonel

698
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:34,439
Wake up, sir!

699
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:38,235
Noda

700
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:49,246
If you wanna stay alive,
stay out of my sight

701
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:51,873
Hey!

702
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:54,084
So damn cold

703
01:10:55,627 --> 01:10:57,379
If we don't warm him up, He'll die

704
01:10:57,504 --> 01:10:58,880
Please move

705
01:10:59,673 --> 01:11:01,091
Who cares?

706
01:11:01,216 --> 01:11:04,135
That bastard's not even worth
stomping on

707
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:08,556
I beg you

708
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:11,851
Make room for him, please

709
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:21,987
Try saving him, then
It probably won't work

710
01:11:22,112 --> 01:11:26,157
What are you doing!
We have to save the Colonel!

711
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:38,920
Mukai! If he's a goner,
bring him to the incinerator

712
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:43,341
No use watching him die
Let's go

713
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:55,186
Jun-shik, have a drink

714
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,818
Look at that

715
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:03,236
If you get frostbitten here,

716
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:06,156
you end up being firewood like him

717
01:12:11,703 --> 01:12:15,665
This is the warmest place
in the whole camp

718
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:21,212
Your legs are your life
Take good care of 'em

719
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:26,676
I like it here

720
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:30,347
No Japs calling me a Korean dog

721
01:12:31,765 --> 01:12:34,267
We should go back when the war's over

722
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:36,227
I'm not

723
01:12:36,353 --> 01:12:37,562
There's nothing

724
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:40,148
but pulling a rickshaw there

725
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:45,320
Having a drink reminds me of home

726
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,156
Eun-soo's probably fine, right?

727
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,951
I miss her

728
01:13:00,335 --> 01:13:02,003
All stand!

729
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:05,215
Starting the day without bowing

730
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:07,467
towards our Emperor is contemptible

731
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:09,594
There is no exception here!

732
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:11,471
Get up!

733
01:13:13,098 --> 01:13:15,350
No need. Keep eating

734
01:13:15,475 --> 01:13:16,434
It's an order!

735
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:17,936
Crazy bastard

736
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:20,313
Everyone stand! Now!

737
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:28,071
Private Jun-shik Kim! Get up!

738
01:13:28,196 --> 01:13:30,448
Private Kim!

739
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,875
We're no longer your subordinates

740
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:46,005
We were unjustly dragged
and forced to become Imperial soldiers

741
01:13:46,131 --> 01:13:49,926
As the Soviets can't demand reform,

742
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:53,596
you have no right to force us to bow

743
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:55,056
Remember

744
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:57,725
From now on,
I'm not Private Jun-shik Kim

745
01:13:57,851 --> 01:14:00,603
but the Korean marathoner Jun-shik Kim!

746
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:02,397
Crazy fool!

747
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:04,315
You want to die!

748
01:14:04,441 --> 01:14:09,821
You're the crazy one
who killed hundreds of soldiers!

749
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:14,075
Commit hara-kiri like Colonel Takakura!

750
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:24,836
Bastard!

751
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:36,973
Since you have the energy to fight,
guess you're not hungry enough

752
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:42,020
Grudges between
a Korean and a Japanese, huh?

753
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:44,772
You got your wish

754
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:50,987
Fight till one of you dies!

755
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:52,530
Kill him, Jun-shik! Hurry!

756
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:53,615
Jun-shik!

757
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:55,950
Jun-shik! Hurry!

758
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:20,391
Jun-shik!

759
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:16,072
One of us should've died

760
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:18,366
Today's the day

761
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:20,910
Colonel! The knife, sir!

762
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:43,474
Colonel! Colonel!

763
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:06,080
Jun-shik! The knife!

764
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:32,732
Kill me, Korean dog!

765
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:37,528
Kill him!

766
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:16,984
Hold it up right!

767
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:20,154
Hurry up and do it!

768
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:30,039
Stop slacking off!

769
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:33,793
When did this happen?

770
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:35,211
It's okay, Jun-shik

771
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:36,713
Don't

772
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,717
It's okay

773
01:18:40,842 --> 01:18:42,552
Hold still

774
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,069
Germany invaded the Soviet Union

775
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:05,700
The Soviets may speed up exchanging
POWs to reinforce their army

776
01:19:09,996 --> 01:19:13,875
Number 1277!

777
01:19:17,837 --> 01:19:19,547
He's one of your men

778
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:21,215
Anton! Go catch him!

779
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:23,009
Yes, sir!

780
01:19:23,593 --> 01:19:26,429
It's time for frostbite examination

781
01:19:27,013 --> 01:19:30,349
Where's Choon-bok?

782
01:20:08,179 --> 01:20:10,139
Take him away

783
01:20:13,518 --> 01:20:14,769
Gwang-choon!

784
01:20:14,894 --> 01:20:17,730
No! No!

785
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:19,607
Drag him out!

786
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:23,569
Let's go!

787
01:20:24,654 --> 01:20:28,991
I'm fine! I can still work, sir!

788
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:31,118
Tell 'em Jun-shik!

789
01:20:31,244 --> 01:20:33,538
I want to live, Jun-shik!

790
01:20:33,663 --> 01:20:34,956
Gwang-choon!

791
01:20:35,081 --> 01:20:38,125
- I want to live, Jun-shik!
- Gwang-choon!

792
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:40,586
I want to live, Jun-shik!

793
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:42,004
Lets Go!

794
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:43,256
Help!

795
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:45,216
Gwang-choon!

796
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:50,680
Choon-bok? Choon-bok?

797
01:20:50,805 --> 01:20:53,349
You're not hiding in here, are you?

798
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:56,102
Choon-bok?

799
01:20:57,478 --> 01:20:58,938
Choon-bok?

800
01:20:59,063 --> 01:21:01,315
- You son of a bitch!
- Shut up!

801
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:05,611
Come out, pal!

802
01:21:05,987 --> 01:21:07,864
Come out!

803
01:21:08,531 --> 01:21:10,449
You wanna die?

804
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:14,245
I was starving

805
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:18,040
Put the bread down and come out now

806
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:28,009
What do we do?

807
01:21:30,261 --> 01:21:32,179
What do we do?

808
01:21:33,598 --> 01:21:35,099
Who's there?

809
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:36,601
How dare you steal, you bastard!

810
01:21:36,726 --> 01:21:38,060
He's the one

811
01:21:38,185 --> 01:21:41,022
- He's the thief!
- What are you doing?

812
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:46,527
Tell 'em I didn't eat it!
Please Jong-dae!

813
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:48,779
Jong-dae! Jong-dae!

814
01:21:48,905 --> 01:21:53,951
A rat sneaked
into our food storage today

815
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:59,957
Luckily we caught him,
thanks to comrade Anton

816
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:06,297
As you know,
stealing is punishable by death

817
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:14,722
Jong-dae! Tell 'em I didn't eat it!

818
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,600
I'm scared!

819
01:22:17,725 --> 01:22:22,605
Tell 'em I didn't eat the bread!

820
01:22:37,662 --> 01:22:40,081
Execute him!

821
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:49,298
Jun-shik! Gwang-choon!
Make it back home alive!

822
01:23:15,408 --> 01:23:16,367
Is it because of this?

823
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:18,077
This is more important
than a friend's life?

824
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:19,370
This is who you really are?

825
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:20,913
Call yourself human?

826
01:23:21,664 --> 01:23:23,874
Yeah, I'm not human

827
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:26,961
I'm not the Jong-dae you know!

828
01:23:27,086 --> 01:23:28,921
I'm Anton!

829
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:31,340
I'm Anton, you bastard!

830
01:23:31,465 --> 01:23:35,594
Call me Anton from now on! Got that!

831
01:23:39,724 --> 01:23:41,809
How long do you think this
armband will protect you?

832
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:44,562
How could you do that to Choon-bok?

833
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:46,522
What do you know?

834
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:50,651
You don't know anything!

835
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:54,030
Shut up and stay out of my life

836
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:58,576
Do you know that Gwang-choon died?

837
01:24:00,745 --> 01:24:03,539
He's probably nothing, but ashes by now

838
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:10,838
If you pull that again in front of them,
I'll kill you

839
01:24:20,473 --> 01:24:23,392
Your emperor abandoned you

840
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:26,312
How dare you speak of our Emperor!

841
01:24:26,437 --> 01:24:32,276
POW repatriation has been denied

842
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:37,239
We showed mercy on you,
but the Japanese refused

843
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:39,909
They're battling Americans
in the Pacific

844
01:24:40,034 --> 01:24:44,830
and have no interest in you

845
01:24:45,206 --> 01:24:47,958
You expect me to believe that?

846
01:24:48,084 --> 01:24:51,462
Imperial soldiers
are sons of the Emperor

847
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:53,130
A father does not abandon his son

848
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:55,758
That's what you want to believe

849
01:24:55,883 --> 01:25:00,554
You naive, poor, abandoned son

850
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:05,226
You will also face death
in the incinerator here

851
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:17,071
It's a Kokeshi

852
01:25:19,657 --> 01:25:21,951
Is your hometown Yamagata?

853
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:24,411
You're good

854
01:25:24,537 --> 01:25:28,290
You know, sir? Have you been there?

855
01:25:28,415 --> 01:25:31,961
My grandfather took me there
when I was young

856
01:25:32,086 --> 01:25:34,004
It's a beautiful place

857
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:37,925
I grew up there my whole life

858
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:40,261
My family ran a carpentry shop
for generations

859
01:25:40,386 --> 01:25:42,012
When I go back,

860
01:25:42,138 --> 01:25:45,599
I want to be a great carpenter
like my father

861
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:54,024
Do you know why I chose to be
your adjutant for Nomonhan, sir?

862
01:25:54,150 --> 01:26:00,489
Because I saw your firm conviction
for our country in your eyes

863
01:26:03,534 --> 01:26:05,119
Conviction

864
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,160
Look out!

865
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:50,998
Son of a bitch!

866
01:26:52,249 --> 01:26:53,792
Tsukamoto!

867
01:26:53,918 --> 01:26:56,045
You okay? Wake up!

868
01:26:56,170 --> 01:27:00,841
I go easy on you, you cripple,
and for what!

869
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:01,967
Jong-dae!

870
01:27:02,092 --> 01:27:04,011
We're doing our best, too!

871
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:06,639
Your best?

872
01:27:06,764 --> 01:27:11,310
I'll show you my best in beating!
You son of a bitch!

873
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:17,900
You call that your best! You bastards!

874
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:22,029
This is the best!

875
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:23,489
Jong-dae Lee!

876
01:27:23,614 --> 01:27:25,699
It's Anton, fool!

877
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,544
He's dead

878
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,630
Lieutenant!

879
01:27:41,215 --> 01:27:43,092
What?

880
01:27:43,926 --> 01:27:46,011
Never seen a man die before?

881
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:50,683
Get back to work, you bastards!

882
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:56,647
Work, you fools! Get back to work now!

883
01:27:56,772 --> 01:28:00,150
You fools never listen!

884
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:24,091
Damn Jap! How dare you!

885
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:29,471
Stop it!

886
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:33,183
I told you to stay out of my way!

887
01:28:34,101 --> 01:28:36,562
Damn Jap!

888
01:28:36,687 --> 01:28:39,690
I gotta beat it into your head?

889
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:44,903
You bastards!

890
01:28:50,659 --> 01:28:52,328
Damn Jap!

891
01:28:54,997 --> 01:28:56,373
You son of bitch!

892
01:28:57,249 --> 01:28:58,208
Kill 'em!

893
01:29:00,044 --> 01:29:01,795
Bastards! Back to your posts!

894
01:29:11,347 --> 01:29:12,681
Stop! You bastards!

895
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:23,525
There is no mercy for those
who started the riot!

896
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:25,527
Begin the executions!

897
01:30:56,076 --> 01:30:58,912
It's an urgent telegram, sir

898
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:05,335
Grab a uniform!

899
01:31:05,461 --> 01:31:08,046
Change into now!

900
01:31:08,172 --> 01:31:10,883
Germany has declared war against us

901
01:31:11,008 --> 01:31:14,678
Comrade Stalin has given you too,
your final calling

902
01:31:14,803 --> 01:31:16,930
The choice is yours

903
01:31:17,055 --> 01:31:21,602
Those who want to convert
may wear Soviet army uniforms

904
01:31:21,727 --> 01:31:24,271
- Go get the uniforms! Hurry!
- Yes, sir

905
01:31:37,618 --> 01:31:40,162
Hurry up and put it on!

906
01:31:40,954 --> 01:31:41,997
Anton

907
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:45,709
This is a great opportunity for you

908
01:31:45,834 --> 01:31:47,669
I hope you come back victorious

909
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:49,546
Long live the Soviet Union!

910
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:51,048
Good luck!

911
01:31:53,759 --> 01:31:55,219
Comrade!

912
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:59,139
Please give them a chance, too

913
01:32:00,766 --> 01:32:02,059
Let them go!

914
01:32:02,184 --> 01:32:05,062
Thank you, sir!
Long live the Soviet Union!

915
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:17,574
Hurry up and put it on!

916
01:32:28,377 --> 01:32:32,339
Hasegawa Tatsuo
This is your last chance

917
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:38,762
I'll say it one more time. Put it on.

918
01:32:59,449 --> 01:33:04,246
Let's give it a good shot

919
01:33:04,371 --> 01:33:09,376
It's better than freezing to death

920
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:11,003
Right, Jun-shik?

921
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:16,383
Long live the Soviet Union! Hurrah!

922
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:18,176
Bastards

923
01:33:24,433 --> 01:33:33,900
The Soviet army uniform suits
our colonel so well, doesn't it?

924
01:33:43,035 --> 01:33:45,579
"DECEMBER, 1941 ZHEDOVSK, SOVIET UNION"

925
01:33:56,298 --> 01:33:58,800
Get off! Get off, now!

926
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:02,387
Get off!

927
01:34:03,764 --> 01:34:05,807
Long live the Soviet Union!

928
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:09,061
Hurrah!

929
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:16,193
Get off! Move it!

930
01:34:26,995 --> 01:34:30,332
This will be a grave
for the Germans' today!

931
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:35,253
Thank you, sir!

932
01:34:35,379 --> 01:34:37,673
Show the cowardly Germans
the valor of the Soviet army!

933
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:47,349
It's mine!

934
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:02,155
You are proud Soviet soldiers!

935
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,699
Charge! Attack!

936
01:35:03,824 --> 01:35:05,450
Charge!

937
01:35:10,247 --> 01:35:12,290
Charge!

938
01:35:12,874 --> 01:35:14,334
Charge!

939
01:35:14,835 --> 01:35:16,712
Charge! Attack!

940
01:35:16,837 --> 01:35:18,422
Charge!

941
01:35:29,141 --> 01:35:31,643
Charge!

942
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:33,019
Fire!

943
01:35:54,374 --> 01:35:57,294
Charge! Charge!

944
01:36:24,196 --> 01:36:26,990
Let go, you bastard!

945
01:36:27,532 --> 01:36:31,870
What? You wanna live, too?

946
01:36:31,995 --> 01:36:33,413
I do, too!

947
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:36,291
I'm not dying here! You die!

948
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:37,876
You die!

949
01:37:04,027 --> 01:37:05,403
Tatsuo!

950
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:24,214
Move it! Move it!

951
01:37:28,134 --> 01:37:31,847
Charge! Charge!

952
01:37:31,972 --> 01:37:33,807
Charge!

953
01:37:36,518 --> 01:37:37,769
Jong-dae!

954
01:37:45,235 --> 01:37:48,113
Damn bastards!

955
01:37:52,409 --> 01:37:54,578
No bullets!

956
01:37:55,203 --> 01:37:57,414
Jong-dae! Let's run!
This is dying like dogs!

957
01:37:57,539 --> 01:38:00,000
It may be for you, but not me!

958
01:38:00,125 --> 01:38:01,209
Charge!

959
01:38:01,334 --> 01:38:03,712
You don't have any more bullets!

960
01:38:05,922 --> 01:38:10,051
Charge! Charge!

961
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:33,325
Charge!

962
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:35,243
Jong-dae! Stop!

963
01:38:35,952 --> 01:38:36,828
Come back!

964
01:38:36,953 --> 01:38:40,248
There is no retreat! Charge!

965
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:49,382
Charge! Attack!

966
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:57,974
There is no retreat!

967
01:38:58,725 --> 01:39:00,393
Attack!

968
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:02,520
Charge!

969
01:39:02,646 --> 01:39:04,356
Jong-dae!

970
01:39:05,482 --> 01:39:07,442
Charge!

971
01:39:21,247 --> 01:39:22,499
Jong-dae!

972
01:39:29,339 --> 01:39:30,632
Jong-dae!

973
01:39:39,557 --> 01:39:42,268
What's with my goddamned life

974
01:39:42,394 --> 01:39:45,188
Shit, I wanted to live it up

975
01:39:46,189 --> 01:39:48,858
I'm so sorry, Jun-shik

976
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:52,195
Jong-dae

977
01:40:01,871 --> 01:40:03,999
I want to see Eun-soo

978
01:40:04,124 --> 01:40:06,626
I miss Eun-soo

979
01:40:21,224 --> 01:40:22,684
Jun-shik

980
01:40:23,685 --> 01:40:25,228
No, Jun-shik

981
01:40:30,859 --> 01:40:32,694
Stay right here

982
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:36,740
Don't go out there

983
01:40:58,303 --> 01:41:03,308
Charge! There is no retreat!

984
01:41:03,433 --> 01:41:10,190
I'll kill anyone who tries to run!

985
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:13,651
Charge ahead! Attack!

986
01:41:13,777 --> 01:41:15,487
Fools!

987
01:41:16,154 --> 01:41:17,947
Attack!

988
01:41:18,073 --> 01:41:20,283
Imperial soldier don't retreat!

989
01:41:25,205 --> 01:41:26,539
Charge!

990
01:41:26,664 --> 01:41:28,166
Attack!

991
01:42:57,005 --> 01:42:59,382
You'll need it to make it
over the mountains

992
01:43:09,184 --> 01:43:10,894
Where do you plan to go?

993
01:43:14,314 --> 01:43:16,065
To German territory

994
01:44:48,616 --> 01:44:51,077
I hope we're going the right way

995
01:44:52,453 --> 01:44:54,914
I hope the snow stops

996
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:57,208
Even if we make it to German territory

997
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:59,961
it won't be easy to make it back home

998
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:04,507
You don't have to come,
if you don't want to

999
01:45:11,431 --> 01:45:12,974
Back then

1000
01:45:14,392 --> 01:45:16,728
Why didn't you kill me?

1001
01:46:48,986 --> 01:46:50,238
Tatsuo!

1002
01:46:50,863 --> 01:46:52,281
Wake up!

1003
01:47:48,129 --> 01:47:50,006
I'll go find some medicine

1004
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:53,259
Kim...

1005
01:47:58,097 --> 01:47:59,974
Jun-shik Kim

1006
01:48:05,396 --> 01:48:07,148
I'll be right back

1007
01:48:49,232 --> 01:48:52,401
Help! Help me!

1008
01:48:54,487 --> 01:48:56,614
Help me! I'm a Japanese soldier

1009
01:48:56,739 --> 01:48:58,658
My friend's in danger

1010
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:04,455
What's he saying?

1011
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:05,498
I'm a Japanese soldier

1012
01:49:05,623 --> 01:49:07,166
We're on the same side!

1013
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:09,835
Take him away!

1014
01:49:11,128 --> 01:49:14,590
I'm a Japanese soldier, not a POW!

1015
01:49:14,715 --> 01:49:15,967
Lets Go!

1016
01:49:17,093 --> 01:49:19,929
You bastard!

1017
01:49:20,888 --> 01:49:25,977
Help me!

1018
01:49:26,102 --> 01:49:28,312
A man is dying! Please!

1019
01:49:28,563 --> 01:49:31,857
Take him away, now!

1020
01:49:33,109 --> 01:49:35,528
Let go! Let go!

1021
01:49:36,153 --> 01:49:37,405
Tatsuo!

1022
01:49:38,531 --> 01:49:40,074
Tatsuo!

1023
01:49:41,284 --> 01:49:43,286
Lets Go!

1024
01:49:43,744 --> 01:49:45,580
Tatsuo!

1025
01:49:46,789 --> 01:49:48,374
Tatsuo!

1026
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:50,876
Search every corner

1027
01:49:51,002 --> 01:49:52,420
You go up that way

1028
01:50:02,305 --> 01:50:05,308
"3 YEARS LATER"

1029
01:50:05,433 --> 01:50:08,227
There's word that the Allied Forces

1030
01:50:08,352 --> 01:50:10,855
will invade Nord-Pas-de-Calais

1031
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:13,858
Then we hit the jackpot
getting stationed in Normandy

1032
01:50:13,983 --> 01:50:17,820
If Germany loses,
aren't we all dead anyways?

1033
01:50:17,945 --> 01:50:20,239
Think they'll take us back?

1034
01:50:20,364 --> 01:50:24,201
We'd be lucky if they don't
call us traitors and shoot us

1035
01:50:24,327 --> 01:50:25,578
That's why we should run away

1036
01:50:25,703 --> 01:50:27,455
You said you'll run for 2 years now

1037
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:28,664
I'm going for sure this time

1038
01:50:28,789 --> 01:50:31,584
I heard from a man in another unit

1039
01:50:31,709 --> 01:50:35,004
There's a secret merchant ship
to Jamaica at Cherbourg Harbor

1040
01:50:35,129 --> 01:50:37,882
How'll you get there? Swim?

1041
01:50:38,007 --> 01:50:40,134
If you get caught trying to run,
you'll be shot!

1042
01:50:40,259 --> 01:50:41,427
Wanna make a bet?

1043
01:50:42,470 --> 01:50:45,598
I bet 50 marks you can't run away

1044
01:50:45,723 --> 01:50:47,266
Bet 100 marks, stupid

1045
01:50:47,391 --> 01:50:49,477
Bet even your boots, you pig

1046
01:50:58,611 --> 01:51:00,946
"May, 1944, NORMANDY, FRANCE"

1047
01:51:01,072 --> 01:51:06,911
Our battalion
will build additional defense walls

1048
01:51:07,036 --> 01:51:09,497
and defense lines in the Atlantic

1049
01:51:09,622 --> 01:51:12,917
From tomorrow,
you will build defense walls

1050
01:51:13,042 --> 01:51:18,381
on the shore with unit 795

1051
01:51:18,506 --> 01:51:24,804
Our job is to build
the defense encampment on Normandy hill

1052
01:51:34,772 --> 01:51:37,024
March forward! Hurry up!

1053
01:51:43,823 --> 01:51:46,492
Squad 3! Unit 2! Go to barracks 14!

1054
01:52:40,004 --> 01:52:41,130
Hey

1055
01:52:47,386 --> 01:52:50,431
Shouldn't you give up
looking for your Korean friend?

1056
01:52:51,098 --> 01:52:52,558
You're the only Asian here

1057
01:52:52,683 --> 01:52:54,727
That guy's so lucky

1058
01:52:54,852 --> 01:53:00,107
He gets to go in and out of base at will

1059
01:53:30,262 --> 01:53:32,723
Tatsuo! Aren't you coming in?

1060
01:53:32,807 --> 01:53:33,891
Let's go

1061
01:53:34,016 --> 01:53:38,479
Go ahead, I'll rest here for a sec

1062
01:53:39,396 --> 01:53:40,773
See ya later, then

1063
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:46,171
I thought you might be dead

1064
01:54:46,839 --> 01:54:49,508
But you're here in the Eastern battalion

1065
01:54:49,633 --> 01:54:51,635
When did you come to Normandy?

1066
01:54:57,141 --> 01:54:58,767
Jun-shik?

1067
01:54:59,268 --> 01:55:01,103
Did you say something?

1068
01:55:01,228 --> 01:55:03,564
Can you repeat it?

1069
01:55:06,108 --> 01:55:07,651
Tatsuo!

1070
01:55:20,581 --> 01:55:22,666
It's more comfortable this way

1071
01:55:22,791 --> 01:55:26,503
I can't hear gunshots or screams

1072
01:55:55,115 --> 01:55:56,325
It's over

1073
01:55:58,494 --> 01:55:59,870
Let's play soccer

1074
01:55:59,995 --> 01:56:00,788
Tatsuo!

1075
01:56:00,913 --> 01:56:04,917
We're going to play against Squad 8!

1076
01:57:08,856 --> 01:57:10,649
Man, they're fast

1077
01:57:31,503 --> 01:57:36,133
I sometimes think of
when we first ran together

1078
01:57:36,884 --> 01:57:41,638
The day you moved in
I lost coz my rubber shoes fell off,

1079
01:57:41,764 --> 01:57:44,767
But I was happy to have
a new running mate

1080
01:57:47,978 --> 01:57:51,690
We came much too far

1081
01:57:55,235 --> 01:57:59,740
How long will it take
to run home from here?

1082
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:03,160
More than a year, right?

1083
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:11,752
We know the Allied forces
will attack Nord-Pas-de-Calais

1084
01:58:11,877 --> 01:58:18,383
The Eastern battalion will all be
sent to Nord-Pas-de-Calais!

1085
01:58:18,509 --> 01:58:26,934
You will all be reborn
as true German soldiers!

1086
01:58:27,059 --> 01:58:30,854
Pack up your gear

1087
01:58:30,979 --> 01:58:33,273
We move out at 09:00 hours tomorrow!

1088
01:58:33,398 --> 01:58:34,942
Dismissed!

1089
01:58:38,821 --> 01:58:42,866
We're all dead
I thought we'd be safe in Normandy

1090
01:58:43,659 --> 01:58:45,077
What's going on?

1091
01:58:47,246 --> 01:58:48,956
We're being transferred

1092
01:58:49,081 --> 01:58:50,707
It's nothing

1093
01:59:04,221 --> 01:59:07,266
Sending us to battle but
feeding us this rubbish

1094
01:59:08,433 --> 01:59:12,479
I thought we'd get wine and steak
when we came to France

1095
01:59:12,604 --> 01:59:14,064
Damn

1096
01:59:16,358 --> 01:59:17,609
Karim

1097
01:59:18,193 --> 01:59:21,905
I'm going to Cherbourg at dawn

1098
01:59:22,447 --> 01:59:23,657
Are you crazy?

1099
01:59:23,782 --> 01:59:26,201
I got the contact info from Roman

1100
01:59:26,326 --> 01:59:27,786
Is Roman going?

1101
01:59:29,037 --> 01:59:30,998
That liar

1102
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:33,625
How will you get there?

1103
01:59:38,463 --> 01:59:42,134
The food truck always leaves at dawn

1104
01:59:42,259 --> 01:59:45,929
We gotta go when you're on watch

1105
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:50,934
Think it over

1106
01:59:51,059 --> 01:59:55,022
If you get caught, you're dead

1107
01:59:56,440 --> 01:59:58,525
Is it coz of your friend?

1108
02:00:00,944 --> 02:00:02,196
Fine

1109
02:00:03,947 --> 02:00:06,283
I'll see you at dawn

1110
02:00:26,762 --> 02:00:29,973
We're not going to Nord-Pas-de-Calais

1111
02:00:31,558 --> 02:00:33,936
We're going to Cherbourg

1112
02:00:34,061 --> 02:00:35,562
Cherbourg?

1113
02:00:36,313 --> 02:00:40,859
A ship there will take us home

1114
02:00:41,860 --> 02:00:43,487
Jun-shik

1115
02:00:43,612 --> 02:00:45,197
Let's go home

1116
02:00:46,073 --> 02:00:49,743
where your sister and father are

1117
02:00:55,290 --> 02:00:58,710
Can we really make it home?

1118
02:00:59,002 --> 02:01:01,255
We could get killed on the way

1119
02:01:02,756 --> 02:01:07,261
Still, we can't die here

1120
02:02:02,024 --> 02:02:03,317
Karim!

1121
02:02:05,736 --> 02:02:06,987
Karim!

1122
02:02:20,417 --> 02:02:21,835
Karim!

1123
02:02:22,169 --> 02:02:23,712
Karim!

1124
02:02:23,837 --> 02:02:25,047
Tatsuo!

1125
02:02:25,172 --> 02:02:28,675
Those aren't planes, are they?

1126
02:02:30,218 --> 02:02:31,386
Tatsuo!

1127
02:02:46,360 --> 02:02:47,444
Tatsuo!

1128
02:03:20,185 --> 02:03:22,854
Jun-shik!

1129
02:03:23,730 --> 02:03:24,606
Jun-shik!

1130
02:03:24,731 --> 02:03:25,857
Tatsuo!

1131
02:03:26,733 --> 02:03:29,319
Tatsuo! Tatsuo!

1132
02:03:30,237 --> 02:03:31,154
Jun-shik!

1133
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:32,447
Stay there!

1134
02:03:32,572 --> 02:03:34,950
I'll come to you! Wait for me!

1135
02:03:36,451 --> 02:03:37,828
Hurry! It's an attack!

1136
02:03:37,953 --> 02:03:41,415
Prepare for battle!

1137
02:04:35,177 --> 02:04:37,137
All units to battle positions!

1138
02:04:37,262 --> 02:04:39,222
The Allied Forces have attacked!

1139
02:04:42,476 --> 02:04:46,646
To your battle positions!

1140
02:04:48,315 --> 02:04:52,611
Hurry and grab the machine gun!

1141
02:04:53,069 --> 02:04:53,987
Grab it!

1142
02:04:54,112 --> 02:04:56,156
Everyone to your battle positions!

1143
02:05:40,867 --> 02:05:43,370
Move it! Move it!

1144
02:06:17,404 --> 02:06:18,363
Fire!

1145
02:06:38,925 --> 02:06:39,926
Fire!

1146
02:07:03,158 --> 02:07:04,367
Jun-shik!

1147
02:07:07,412 --> 02:07:08,705
Jun-shik!

1148
02:07:09,497 --> 02:07:10,707
Tatsuo!

1149
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:14,919
Are you okay?
Let's get out of here, now!

1150
02:07:15,837 --> 02:07:18,006
Grab the machine gun! Now!

1151
02:07:18,131 --> 02:07:20,967
Hurry up, you fools!

1152
02:07:33,605 --> 02:07:35,899
Can't you see the enemy!

1153
02:07:36,691 --> 02:07:39,653
Reload and fire, now!

1154
02:07:39,778 --> 02:07:42,405
Allied forces attacked!

1155
02:08:04,594 --> 02:08:08,306
Send reinforcements!

1156
02:08:17,232 --> 02:08:18,358
Damn it

1157
02:11:25,253 --> 02:11:26,671
Let's run for it

1158
02:11:27,213 --> 02:11:28,756
Don't lag behind

1159
02:11:31,092 --> 02:11:34,137
You'll be watching my back as you run

1160
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:07,462
Are you okay?

1161
02:12:07,587 --> 02:12:08,922
This won't kill me

1162
02:12:09,047 --> 02:12:10,089
Let's go!

1163
02:12:17,263 --> 02:12:18,056
Jun-shik

1164
02:12:18,181 --> 02:12:21,601
Come on! We have to get home!

1165
02:13:08,523 --> 02:13:09,983
Tatsuo

1166
02:13:12,527 --> 02:13:13,987
Are you okay?

1167
02:13:34,882 --> 02:13:36,300
Jun-shik

1168
02:13:36,676 --> 02:13:38,344
Jun-shik

1169
02:13:56,738 --> 02:14:03,077
You're Jun-shik Kim from now on

1170
02:14:03,536 --> 02:14:08,791
If you say you're Japanese,
they might kill you

1171
02:14:10,918 --> 02:14:18,301
Say you were dragged here
and forced into the Eastern battalion

1172
02:14:18,885 --> 02:14:21,471
Jun-shik! Wake up!

1173
02:14:22,889 --> 02:14:26,476
I have no regrets

1174
02:14:27,185 --> 02:14:30,980
Though I couldn't achieve my dream

1175
02:14:33,858 --> 02:14:36,027
You can't go like this!

1176
02:14:36,444 --> 02:14:39,655
Let's go home and run together!

1177
02:14:39,781 --> 02:14:41,282
Jun-shik

1178
02:14:43,576 --> 02:14:50,666
I wanted to run again
when I go back home

1179
02:14:56,506 --> 02:15:03,513
Promise you'll make it back alive...

1180
02:15:06,557 --> 02:15:07,767
Jun-shik!

1181
02:15:11,062 --> 02:15:12,313
Jun-shik!

1182
02:15:14,273 --> 02:15:16,150
Jun-shik!

1183
02:15:18,736 --> 02:15:21,280
Jun-shik!

1184
02:15:23,116 --> 02:15:25,159
Jun-shik!

1185
02:17:03,466 --> 02:17:07,511
I sometimes think of
when we first ran together

1186
02:17:07,637 --> 02:17:09,138
The day you moved in

1187
02:17:10,389 --> 02:17:13,684
I was happy to have a new running mate

1188
02:17:36,374 --> 02:17:39,043
Ready, go!

1189
02:18:09,700 --> 02:18:20,800
