1
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,950
-You like the wine?
-Very much.

2
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,120
-Would you like some more?
-Please. No. Here.

3
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,090
You're good.

4
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,940
The wine, candles, the dinner.

5
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,030
What's next?

6
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,290
Let me set the mood.

7
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,430
Last time I saw a woman drink
like that, she was drowning.

8
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,470
-Did she die?
-I don't know. I was just a lifeguard.

9
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,480
You know, I don't want you
to get the wrong impression...

10
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,860
...that I invited you up here...

11
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:27,950
Markell, get your hand out of my shirt.
Come on, Markell, stop.

12
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,960
-Let's get in the back seat.
-Why can't we just watch the movie?

13
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,820
-It's boring.
-This movie ain't boring, it's good.

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,130
Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss.

15
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,060
-Do you love me, baby?
-Of course I love you.

16
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,150
Tell me why.
Tell me why you love me.

17
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,490
-Right now?
-Right now. I wanna know.

18
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,700
'Cause you're fine.

19
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,690
That's deep. That's real deep.
'Cause I'm fine.

20
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,200
But I see where you coming from.

21
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,250
-Why you trippin'?
-I ain't trippin'.

22
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,050
Let's get in the back seat
so you can give me some sugar.

23
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,050
-Can you get me popcorn? I'm hungry.
-Popcorn?

24
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,130
Some popcorn, please?
Something. Jujubes. Go on, please?

25
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,020
-I don't believe this.
-Get me popcorn.

26
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,990
And some Jujubes. And some Bonbons!

27
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,160
Justice, I was just thinking.

28
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,120
The real reason why I love you is
because, when I was in jail...

29
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,920
...you sent me all them nice poems.

30
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,050
I'm gonna get your popcorn.

31
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,300
-Kick him in the head.
-You're worried about nothing.

32
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,270
I'll fuck this fool up.

33
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,490
Damn.

34
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,080
I ain't giving you
no more quarters. Shit!

35
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:32,090
Is that the motherfucker
that was at the mall the other day?

36
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,050
-Is that him?
-I don't know.

37
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,730
-Look at his face, dude.
-That's not him.

38
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,940
That's him, dude, I'm telling you.
I remember him. That's him.

39
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,240
Let me get a...

40
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,830
That's that nigga that was talking shit
in front of all his homeboys.

41
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,750
Popcorn and Jujubes.

42
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,540
Shit. Look.

43
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,170
Oh, man. Shit.

44
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,600
You're sick!

45
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,090
-Is that a crime?
-Save it.

46
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:47,680
I think I just saw those fools
I had beef with last week.

47
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,680
So I shot.

48
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,890
Again, and again, and again.

49
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,030
Oh, it felt so good.

50
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,240
But in the end, I was still horny.

51
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,210
My sweet abyss still existed.

52
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,390
Markell! Markell, get up, baby.

53
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,100
Markell, baby, wake up. Markell!

54
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,520
Somebody help me, please!

55
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,440
Somebody help me!

56
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,610
Alone
Lyina, thinking last night

57
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,400
How to find my soul a home

58
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:18,360
Where water is not thirsty
And bread loaf is not stone

59
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,480
I came up with one thing
And I don't believe I'm wrong

60
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,120
That nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone

61
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,720
Alone, all alone

62
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,680
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone

63
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,440
There are some millionaires
With money they can't use

64
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:54,410
Their wives run 'round like banshees
Their children sing the blues

65
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,580
They've got expensive doctors to cure
Their hearts of stone

66
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:04,580
But nobody, no, nobody
Can make it out here alone

67
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,930
Now if you listen closely
I'll tell you what I know

68
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:20,130
Storm clouds are gathering
The wind is gonna blow

69
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:24,260
The race of man is suffering
And I can hear the moan

70
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,990
'Cause nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone

71
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,540
Alone, all alone

72
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:43,250
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone

73
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,510
We got the situation under control.

74
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,220
Just get out of here.
Let us do our job.

75
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,930
We got the situation under control.

76
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:09,450
Look at these. This one right here,
this is bad. Girl, that is to die for.

77
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,160
Jessie's. We do hair.

78
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,330
He just did my girl all wrong.

79
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:19,460
She's scared as hell. I caught her
running around here wearing sunglasses.

80
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,160
And you know how she like bragging
about her green eyes.

81
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,260
Top it off, she's still
in love with the nigga.

82
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,810
What's love got to do with it?

83
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,730
You just telling everybody's business.

84
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,560
I'd tell your business too
if you had something to tell.

85
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,690
Hey, Heywood. Hey, Dex.
How you doing, Maxine?

86
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,240
Come on, girl. You ready?
You got your hair with you?

87
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,700
What you think this is?

88
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,250
-I know you ain't getting smart.
-Shut up, girl.

89
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,960
That's what I thought. Come on.
Sit your butt down.

90
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,130
-So, what's up?
-Nothing up.

91
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,180
Morning, Jessie. Got any change?

92
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,030
Hell, no. And get your dirty,
unemployed ass away from my shop.

93
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,900
Baha? Baby, do me a favour.

94
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,740
Go to the liquor store and get me
two honey buns and... What else?

95
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,700
Some Big Red. Yeah, I know.

96
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,330
-Twenty.
-Yeah, a 20.

97
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,250
And bring me my change!

98
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,420
Leave this conditioner on
for five minutes.

99
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,040
You like that, don't you?

100
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,730
-Jessie, you are so beautiful.
-Thank you, Heywood.

101
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,020
-I love you.
-I love you too.

102
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,650
-And I love myself.
-I know. Get back to your client.

103
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,070
I love it when you're so forceful.

104
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,790
So...

105
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,920
Yeah.

106
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,630
-So he's out, huh?
-I don't know. I'm thinking about it.

107
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,050
I know y'all got
buck-wild last night.

108
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:22,010
-Where did y'all go?
-Could you put those over here?

109
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,100
-Snooty Fox Motor Inn.
-No, you didn't.

110
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,020
People, please remember
to turn in your receipts.

111
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,390
-We always do.
-I got mine right here.

112
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:36,030
-Still got them red walls and all that?
-Mirrors on the ceiling.

113
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,660
Same old, same old. I'm coming
up short. Are they turning in receipts?

114
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,290
They've been filling them out
and turning them in.

115
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,840
When was the last time you were there?

116
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,510
-What, Snooty Fox?
-Yeah.

117
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,220
-It's been so long, I don't remember.
-That's what I know.

118
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,770
My girl need her hair
and her nails done.

119
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,480
-Does she have an appointment?
-No.

120
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,690
-She don't have no hair, either.
-Heywood.

121
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,450
Maxine. Make an appointment.

122
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,370
Why are you always wearing hats?
What are you hiding?

123
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,620
-Give me my hat. I got new growth.
-Put it back on.

124
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:21,040
You need to let me do something
to that head of yours.

125
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:26,050
Lord, I'm tired. You got a poem for me?
Lord knows I need one.

126
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,710
I left my notebook in the car.

127
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,680
-Outgoing mail.
-Where are the stamps?

128
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,730
When you going to get a man?
Always asking questions about mine...

129
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,220
What, you still in mourning?

130
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,110
Sporting black, looking tore up from
the floor up, no time for your hair.

131
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,530
You can always tell when a woman
ain't giving up no coochie.

132
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:55,580
I like wearing black. Besides, I ain't
got time for no man in my life.

133
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,000
-Know what your problem is?
-So suddenly I got a problem?

134
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,260
-What's my problem?
-You make bad choices in men.

135
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,300
You don't know how to pick them.

136
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:20,030
Yo, what's up? What's up, Mr. Postman?
Got some spare change?

137
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,910
No, but I got a spare stamp
so you can mail a job application.

138
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,320
Begging-ass motherfucker.

139
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,880
Y'all didn't get nothing but bills.

140
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Why you always so mad?

141
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:51,350
You must ain't got no man
'cause you don't never smile.

142
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,940
-Do you?
-What do you want from me?

143
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:02,450
I think you kind of fly.
We could start with your phone number.

144
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,830
What's your name?

145
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,000
-Lucky.
-Lucky?

146
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,420
Come here, Lucky.
I wanna whisper something to you.

147
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,390
Let's cut the bullshit.

148
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,150
Now, what do you really,
really want from me?

149
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,570
-You wanna smell my poonani?
-Yeah.

150
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,400
You'd like that, huh?

151
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,170
Hold on a minute, baby.

152
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:53,220
Jessie? Come here
for a minute, please.

153
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,590
What?

154
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,380
This fine, young, dark brother...

155
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,890
...said he wanna smell my poonani.

156
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,980
Really?

157
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,270
Poonani?

158
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,950
-Should I let him?
-Yeah.

159
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,460
What do you think?

160
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:29,760
You need to get your ass some
breath mints. Crazy black bitches.

161
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,220
Get your ass out of here.

162
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,810
I don't know
why I fuck with these hoes.

163
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,810
Here, man.

164
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,980
Don't smoke it.
Take a stamp too.

165
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,360
God bless you, brother.
Bless you, man!

166
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,400
I'm not fucking with 101st no more.

167
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:53,910
I told that lady about them dogs.
She wants her mail, she gets it herself.

168
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,370
Did you not once consider
using your Mace?

169
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,210
Mace? That's like Binaca to rottweilers.
Y'all don't pay me enough!

170
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,720
-You're saying you don't want your job?
-Here you go.

171
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,550
Fucked his nose up.

172
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,480
Right in the middle, man.
Just like Robin Hood.

173
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,260
Y'all wanna get your asses to work
before you get fired?

174
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,270
-What's up, sergeant?
-What's happening?

175
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,240
-I can't call it.
-I'm calling it.

176
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,280
They trippin'. Put two more buddhaheads
on the mail carrier before me.

177
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,330
-Again?
-Got me sorting mail with Mexicans.

178
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,580
Chicago, why you talking
about Mexicans? I'll kick your ass.

179
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,420
Tell you what, you better quit
smoking that shit at lunch.

180
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,510
At least we got our own country.

181
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,130
Then why the fuck y'all
keep sneaking out?

182
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,060
That shit is funny, right?

183
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,060
Basketball-playing motherfuckers.

184
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,110
-I'm going to Oaktown. You wanna go?
-Yeah.

185
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,730
-You gonna bring a yamp?
-Here you go. You gonna bring a yamp?

186
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,200
-I got mine, man.
-Yamps. What the fuck is a "yamp"?

187
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,120
A young tramp. Now, do you mind?

188
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:16,240
Don't worry about
what the players is talking about.

189
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:22,340
Go have your yamps, corn bread,
ham hocks and whatever else you eat.

190
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,560
-Get out of here.
-Get the ZIP codes right.

191
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,270
-Fix that shit.
-lf we gonna do this...

192
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,650
...have that crazy hoe you fuck with
hook me up with one of her partners.

193
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,760
-I'm gonna hook you up.
-You always say that.

194
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,520
-Hook me up.
-You gonna call your cousin?

195
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:43,820
Not yet. We're supposed to find a way
up there anyway for our music thing.

196
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:48,500
Now it's like I'm getting paid
to go. I'm straight with that.

197
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,960
-See you later.
-Where you going?

198
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,040
Minding my business.

199
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,040
-What's up, nigga?
-Lounging, man.

200
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,040
-What y'all niggas doing?
-To be honest?

201
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,630
Looking for some busters to jack.

202
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,930
I wanted to tell you something.
Remember Little D? Little Derek?

203
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,390
-D-Dog from up there?
-Yesterday, he got his ass capped out.

204
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,550
-Popped his ass out, straight twisted.
-Gone?

205
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,690
But we gonna get the fools
that got him.

206
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,700
-Ain't no thing but a chicken wing.
-Yeah.

207
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,190
-See you.
-All right. Peace.

208
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,200
-Yeah, peace.
-There won't be no peace today.

209
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,990
Get you a motherfucking
tune-up, nigga.

210
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:12,080
There he is.
Mr. Postman working motherfucker here.

211
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,180
-Don't start. What's up, Bone?
-What's up?

212
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:19,220
-Shit. I can't call it.
-How you feeling?

213
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,350
-Tired than a motherfucker.
-Tired, huh?

214
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,220
This ain't none of that chronic,
but you can use some of this Thai bud.

215
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,020
They checking my piss at work.
I can't fuck with it.

216
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,080
That's a terrible thing.

217
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,540
How you doing, Ms. Jackson?

218
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,390
-She can't stand me with a passion.
-She hates your ass.

219
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,600
So, what's up?
You here to check up on Keisha?

220
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,150
I'm gonna give Angel money
to buy her clothes.

221
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,310
Now, you know motherfucking well
you ain't gotta give her money.

222
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,990
I'll take her to the swap meet, Fox
Hills Mall, get her whatever she needs.

223
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,250
No. You ain't got to do that.

224
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,630
-What you mean?
-lt's my daughter. I can handle it.

225
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,130
What did I tell you about this change?
Do I look like Las Vegas?

226
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,680
-Do I look like a slot machine?
-It's all I got.

227
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:31,980
Get your punk ass up out of here
and don't do that shit no more.

228
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,020
-You cold on these fools.
-I can't help it.

229
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:40,140
Check this out. It ain't like
I ain't got the money.

230
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,100
Besides, she call me Daddy
sometimes, anyway.

231
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,000
-What you mean, she call you Daddy?
-Just what I said.

232
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,670
-We gonna see who she call Daddy.
-We'll see.

233
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,450
-We gonna find out.
-What we gonna find out, then?

234
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,670
Well, let's see, then.

235
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,250
Well, hurry your slow ass up, then.

236
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,350
Keisha.

237
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,220
Hi, Daddy.

238
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,520
-Who's your daddy?
-You.

239
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:16,570
That's right. That's your son and
this is my daughter. Don't forget it.

240
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,030
Pothead.

241
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:25,290
It's like I'm her daddy since they
came from the same tired-ass hooker.

242
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,160
How's that?

243
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,750
-Difference.
-What's up, boy?

244
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,620
Felix.

245
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,840
What y'all two fools talking about?

246
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:43,770
-Talking about your yamp ass.
-Here we go. Simple Nick in the house.

247
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,340
Get your ass away from the TV.

248
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:52,190
What you cleaning up for?
This place looks fucked up as normal.

249
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:59,070
What you all nervous for?
You been basing?

250
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:05,000
I ain't doing shit. I don't remember
Saying, " I do, " to neither one of you.

251
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,700
-Has she?
-No, this is what you do:

252
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,510
Get her and get out of my house. Don't
forget to get her some tennis shoes...

253
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:16,720
If welfare wasn't paying the rent,
this wouldn't be your house.

254
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,520
-Fuck you.
-Get your ass back in the room. Tramp.

255
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,810
You know what I told your ass
about that shit!

256
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:29,310
Told her if I catch her doing
that shit again, I'm taking Keisha.

257
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:35,200
-She ain't got to be around this shit.
-Nothing wrong with her. She's crazy.

258
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:39,250
If something was wrong with her ass,
I'd know.

259
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,250
Brother Bone! Brother Bone!

260
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:49,970
Every time I sit down and wanna watch
a cartoon, somebody gotta call me.

261
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:55,850
-Here we go. Scarface.
-Get your stamp-licking ass up.

262
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,390
-What's up, man?
-Help me out, man.

263
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,810
What you got?

264
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,940
Go over there and sit with Tony, okay?

265
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,160
-What's up with all this change?
-That's all I got.

266
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,080
How do you like the Felix outfit?

267
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:17,580
Never mind that!
Just get the diamonds!

268
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,670
Wow, professor! Look at that!

269
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:26,880
Loose diamonds.
Let's go down and pick them up.

270
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,640
Who's that little character?

271
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,900
-Oh, my God!
-Hey, nigga. Get the fuck out of here.

272
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,480
-That is Lucky. That is Lucky!
-Lucky who? Get the fuck out.

273
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,030
Come on, Keisha.
We're going to see your grandma.

274
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,950
Don't be coming in my house
starting all that bullshit!

275
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,500
How you gonna be fucking some nigga
when my daughter's here?

276
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,210
Damn, here they go.

277
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:05,470
-Who is this motherfucker?
-Mind your own motherfucking business.

278
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,330
-I don't need this shit!
-Stupid-ass motherfucker.

279
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,160
-I wanna go too.
-Where are you taking Keisha?

280
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,680
How you gonna be fucking some nigga
while my daughter here?

281
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,850
Where you going with my
goddamn child?

282
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,850
In a time of secret wooing

283
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,770
Today prepares tomorrow's ruin

284
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,360
Left knows not what right is doing

285
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:59,660
My heart is torn asunder

286
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,120
In a time of furtive sighs

287
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,900
Sweet hellos and sad goodbyes

288
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,670
Half-truths told and entire lies

289
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,630
My conscience echoes thunder

290
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,720
In a time when kingdoms come

291
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,970
Joy is brief as summer's fun

292
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:25,600
Happiness
Its race has run

293
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:30,230
Then pain stalks in to plunder

294
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:38,030
-So, what you think?
-It's pretty. What you call it?

295
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,870
" In a Time."

296
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,590
Chicago paging me.
Let me see what he wants.

297
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,800
I can't use your phone?

298
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,550
You know better.

299
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,840
-You got some change?
-I'm straight.

300
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,430
What'd they say?

301
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,790
So, what's up?

302
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,600
Yeah. I'm ready.

303
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,850
We got a hair show to go
to up there, anyway.

304
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:49,530
What you mean, "a fine one"?
You trying to say I got ugly friends?

305
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,980
I ain't got no ugly friends.

306
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,500
You wanna talk about it?

307
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,290
I think you'll feel better
if you talk about it.

308
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,420
What the hell are they
doing out there now?

309
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:14,640
-I'll be glad when we get out of here.
-What's wrong?

310
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,260
What's wrong?

311
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,420
You got your styles together
for the Oakland show?

312
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,760
Yeah, I'm just gonna work
on Dina and Gina's head a bit.

313
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:49,020
If they like it, they like it.
If they don't, they don't.

314
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:55,720
Will you ride with us? We got us a
little caravan going. We gonna party.

315
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:00,230
Oh, Justice. Look at your face.

316
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,620
Listen, I know I'm not your mama,
and I'm not trying to be...

317
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,040
...but I gotta tell you,
you got to move on.

318
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,750
A man is a tool. You got to know
when to take him out the box...

319
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,510
...and when to put him back in. If you
lose one, go get yourself another one.

320
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,970
Take a chance, baby.
Do something different for a change.

321
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,810
There's another man
out there somewhere.

322
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,050
And out here, sometimes
you're gonna lose one.

323
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:36,150
Like a blow dryer or a good hairbrush.

324
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,790
What I got to do?
Play everybody's mama in this shop?

325
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,960
Hell, I got my own problems.

326
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:55,050
Okay, where's my brush?

327
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,510
I'm tired of my shit
disappearing around here.

328
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,810
Why you always borrowing
my shit without asking?

329
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:14,180
I asked you this morning if I could
borrow your brush, and you said yes...

330
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,870
...and I have returned it to you.
Why you gonna cry about it, Dexter?

331
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,750
-You sound like my little niece.
-Here we go again.

332
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,320
What's your new man talking about?

333
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:32,260
Girl, he want me to go on a run
with him. This is good.

334
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,840
I don't have to be messing
with it all the time.

335
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:39,500
-Just get up and go.
-You know, girl...

336
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,850
You're catching me
on the wrong goddamn day.

337
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,400
So you got balls?

338
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:49,400
I was All-City strong safety
at Dorsey High. I'll get in your ass.

339
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,530
And not the way
you want me to, Sexy Dex.

340
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,330
Please. Stop this right now.

341
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,540
-What's a " run"?
-You know what a run is.

342
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,460
I don't know what it is.
Stop messing with your head.

343
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,120
Now, what's a run?

344
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:11,920
A run? Well, it's like...
You really wanna know, girl?

345
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,890
If you don't stop playing with me...

346
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,600
Chicago, my boyfriend,
works at the post office...

347
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:21,650
...the one on Century and Van Ness.

348
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:27,020
Every so often, he and his friend
drive this mail truck up to Oakland.

349
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,910
-J, you listening to me?
-Yeah, I'm listening.

350
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,780
Like I said, they drive
this mail truck to Oakland.

351
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:40,710
And sometimes I go with them.
And I was thinking...

352
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,630
You're not having it, huh?

353
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:48,840
I got your bitch. Okay?
I got your bitch.

354
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,720
-Calm down.
-What you wanna do?

355
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,090
Not here.

356
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:57,650
What you doing seeing a mailman?
They don't make no money.

357
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:01,430
What he gonna do for you,
mail your bills for free?

358
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,610
Why you don't ever wanna have
no fun no more?

359
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:09,160
The world's just a big place
for us to go and fuck up in it.

360
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,160
You gonna end up being an old maid.

361
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:34,100
Need help?

362
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,230
You offer help
when all I got is one bag.

363
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,020
There you go.

364
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:44,480
Put that cigarette out.
I don't allow smoking in here.

365
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:49,160
Come on, Ma, I pay the bills here
and I can't have a cigarette?

366
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:53,280
Shut the fuck up
and put the cigarette out!

367
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:59,530
-You going up north to see Kalil?
-Yeah.

368
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:03,590
I'm finally gonna work
on this music thing.

369
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,310
Somebody could listen to our tape.
I ain't got to do this post office shit.

370
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,810
Don't be cussing around me, boy.
Be glad you got an honest job.

371
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:20,110
Don't go to Oakland every weekend.
You know how Aunt Audrey can get.

372
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,610
Ma, it ain't even like that.

373
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,490
Keisha here.

374
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:33,630
-Really? How's my grandbaby doing?
-Bad as ever.

375
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:41,540
I want her to stay with us for good.
Angel been fucking up, bad.

376
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,140
Basing. I can't have my baby
around that sh... Stuff.

377
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:51,980
Now, are you gonna take care of her?

378
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,020
Yeah.

379
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,190
Just remember, that's your baby.
I'm done raising kids.

380
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:06,960
Quit playing video games and figure out
what you gonna do with your life.

381
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,380
Packed my bags, my stuff...

382
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,140
Wait a second... White Boy.

383
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,360
Come on.

384
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,610
Shit!

385
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,570
I'll call lesha.

386
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,960
Come on, girl. Hurry up.

387
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:30,890
-Hello?
-lesha, what up? What you doing?

388
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:39,130
-I'll hold your jacket for you.
-Bet you will.

389
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:43,230
There go that damn cat again.
I'm gonna kick it one day.

390
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,820
Girl, you kick my cat,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

391
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:50,650
-We gonna have fun.
-I can't believe I'm doing this.

392
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,620
It's gonna be so on, just watch.

393
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,460
I ain't doing this.

394
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:01,790
Motherfucker said she from Ethiopia.
Knew damn well that bitch from Compton.

395
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,470
-She look it, though.
-With a kid named Lamar?

396
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,470
Girl, you got this.
I ain't riding in that.

397
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,520
-Why you gotta be a buster?
-Who you calling a buster?

398
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,520
-You. Take a chance.
-Take a chance, my ass. Look at this!

399
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:20,060
She's fly, now, ain't she, Lucky?
Look, man.

400
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:23,820
-Oh, my God, I know that bitch.
-You don't know her.

401
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:29,990
That's that hoe that work
in the salon on 54th. Here we go.

402
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,120
She act up and her ass is out.

403
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:36,630
Lucky is cool, girl.
That's Lucky right there.

404
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:40,050
He was in the salon, trying to mack.

405
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,470
-Sorry-ass, bald-headed...
-Just be cool.

406
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,850
-You know him, girl?
-She better not act up...

407
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,020
Lucky, this is Justice.
Justice, this is Lucky.

408
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:53,600
-And you already know Chicago.
-What's up, baby?

409
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:56,190
-Baby?
-Shit. Hi.

410
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:59,360
Anyway, let's go. Move!

411
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:04,400
Damn. Watch out, girl.
Get your ass in the back.

412
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,700
Shit, I ain't no fucking bellboy.

413
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,120
Take it easy on that mail!

414
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,500
Sit up here, girl.

415
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,720
Go ahead and
make your seat belts click, baby.

416
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:27,100
We follow all the safety guidelines
around these parts.

417
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,650
Y'all just hold on.

418
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,740
There you go. We out.

419
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,160
Stop. Stop.

420
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:27,780
You don't know
if you wanna kiss me or hit me.

421
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,300
-It's your way of showing you like me.
-I don't.

422
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,840
-Yes, you do. I know what you like.
-What?

423
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:37,670
Man, shit. Muscle! Feel it!

424
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,810
Nigga, that ain't shit.

425
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,890
It ain't? What's that?

426
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,270
Shit, don't be grabbing
my titty like that.

427
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:51,410
-What you want me to do, kiss it?
-Yeah, here. Psych!

428
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:54,320
Stop, Chicago.

429
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:59,250
See? That's better.
Be nice for a change.

430
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,710
Mind if I smoke?

431
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:45,130
Guess not.

432
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,700
You kind of quiet, huh?

433
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:13,360
I guess so.

434
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,540
I ain't got nothing to say.

435
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:23,220
Why you so mean?

436
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:27,430
What you got to be so mean about?

437
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,650
So you one of them angry bitches.
A feminist.

438
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,520
-What'd you call me?
-Said you a mean bitch.

439
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,270
We gotta stop this right now.
You don't know shit about me.

440
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:48,990
Don't be calling me no bitch.

441
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:54,790
I've been acting courteous. Nigga gotta
call you a bitch to get your attention.

442
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,460
I'm a black woman, okay?
I deserve respect.

443
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:02,800
Don't be calling me no bitch.
If I'm a bitch, your mama's a bitch.

444
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:07,850
Save that " black woman" shit.
You bleed once a month like every hoe.

445
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:12,020
We ain't talking about my mama,
we talking about your stuck-up ass.

446
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:16,070
You think a nigga's supposed
to do magic tricks for your ass.

447
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,490
-Pull this shit over right now.
-Where you gonna go?

448
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:23,620
I'll walk, motherfucker.
Pull over.

449
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:26,750
Garb-ass bitch! Get your shit!

450
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,090
I'm tired of your mouth. Talking all
that shit. Walk your ass home!

451
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:33,760
It'll do them fat-ass thighs
some good!

459
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:18,250
You just can't leave her
out in the middle of nowhere.

460
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:21,230
Chicago. Chicago, wake up.

461
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:25,440
Chicago, wake up.
Lucky's leaving Justice.

462
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:28,480
So what?

463
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:32,030

00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:38,700
Get up, Chicago.
Shit. He's leaving her.

466
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:41,870
You better get up

467
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,800
-Lucky, stop the truck.
-What's up?

468
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,340
Man, fuck that bitch.
Think she God's gift to a nigga.

469
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:52,680
Fuck her. Her ass can walk.

470
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,850
J, come on.

00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:01,310
Where you gonna go?
We out in the middle of nowhere.

472
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:05,070
Ain't you kind of hot out there?

473
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:09,020
Lucky said he'd apologize.

474
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:13,950
Justice.

475
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:19,540
She get kind of stubborn sometimes.

476
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,710
Can you stop the truck?

477
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,890
Why you letting him
upset you like this?

478
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:34,730
Girl, you know he trippin'
because he like you.

479
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:40,440
I know you ain't gonna let no nigga
make you walk all the way to Oakland.

480
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:44,200
J, come on.

481
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,910
Man, just chill, all right?

482
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:57,670
If you want to, we can call
the homeys if it's all that.

483
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:03,300
-They still gonna fuck you up.
-Get your ass in the truck.

484
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:08,850
-Shut up, Chicago!
-Frankly, my dear, I don't give a fuck.

485
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,730
"They still gonna fuck you up."

486
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,820
You drive, nigga.

487
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:31,870
Good, now I can get my drink on.

488
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:37,290
Put 20 on four.
Don't get too much liquor.

489
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:41,050
And bring me
some Cheetos and a 40.

490
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:46,560
-You need to put her ass in check.
-Mind your own fucking business.

491
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,480
Fuck that, let's stay on schedule.
Fuck that CP time.

492
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:55,190
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

493
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,070
-ls that your truck?
-Yeah, it's my rig.

494
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,860
Who the dude getting in the cab?

495
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,240
Pardon me.

496
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:07,750

Check and see if you see some Socko.

497
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,790
They don't have no eightball?
Y'all ain't got Olde E?

498
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:20,350
You know they don't sell that
outside the Black neighbourhoods.

499
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:25,520
Oh, well. Chicago just gonna
have to settle for a Miller Light.

500
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,190
I hope they got my gin.

501
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,320
You know how you get when you drink.
You know what your man said.

502
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:41,200
Chicago? That ain't my daddy.
I don't listen to him.

503
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:45,580
-He your man, though.
-Shit, I got him sprung.

504
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:49,050

505
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,340
You know he start stuttering
when he lying.

00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:54,220
No, no, wait, wait...

507
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:57,680
Money? You giving that hoe money?

508
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:01,310
Sometimes I like for my girl
to have the best.

509
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,900
Nigga, you getting played.
I can't believe this shit.

510
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:10,150
You gonna lose stripes over this.
How much pussy you get?

511
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:15,440
I don't hardly have to do nothing.
I been rationing it to him.

512
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,500
Rationing that ass.

513
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:21,490
I'm knocking it every other night.
She can't get enough.

514
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:24,070
You a lying motherfucker.

515
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:28,050
Nigga is weak, girl.
He ain't got no kind of rhythm.

516
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:32,470
Plus, he a preemie.
And you know what a preemie is.

517
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,770
Two-minute brother.

518
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:38,810
Let that bitch get her own job.
Drunk hoe.

519
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:43,520
She need to work in a liquor store,
much as she be drinking.

520
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:47,320
-Is that everything you want?
-Yeah.

521
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:52,370
-So, what you think about Lucky?
-I don't.

522
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:56,960
-I'm gonna get one of these. Want one?
-Yeah, girl.

523
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,880
Where the water at?

524
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,220
-There's a faucet in the back.
-Fill mine up too.

525
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:08,180
-You got this?
-Yeah, I got it.

526
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:09,930
At least I get some poon.

527
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:14,350
Just 'cause I don't pack my shit on a
trip don't mean I ain't getting none.

528
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,190
-I'm handling mine.
-Handling just like this:

529
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,650
Least I ain't losing no money.

530
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:25,410
Hey, partner, you like country music?
Garth Brooks, he's slamming, right?

531
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:33,040
-You old cow.
-Stop, stop, stop!

532
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:37,590
Don't fuck around.
I know what you're about to do.

533
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,990
Quit playing. No, stop!

534
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:43,300
Give me that. Stop!

535
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,020
Here you go, partner.

536
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:55,610

537
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:57,690
Would y'all come on?

538
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:01,730
Boy, you know
I got a schedule to keep to.

539
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:05,740
I'll give you a fucking schedule.

540
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:09,290
-Quit playing and get in.
-Have some fun, man.

541
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,090
Drink some of this.

542
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:31,150
Drink some more,
and drink it to the middle.

543
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:39,730
Shit. Where my 40 at?

544
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:45,540
-Damn, lesha, this ain't no 40.
-They didn't have no Olde E.

545
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:52,300
Got my Cheetos, though.

546
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:59,640
Love is a juice with many tastes

547
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:02,890
Some bitter, others sweet

548
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:07,260
A wine which has few...

549
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,980
Few vineyards

550
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,240
Your nails are so dirty.

551
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:45,730
What you writing?

552
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,070

553
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:53,520
-Say...
-What?

554
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:57,700
-Tell me how much you love me.
-Why?

555
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:02,210
-Because I said so.
-Is that what you wanna hear?

556
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,880
Hell, yeah.

557
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:07,670
Really?

558
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:10,550
Good.

559
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:20,480
You so dumb. The more I teach you,

560
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:25,110
-Something smell good, huh?
-Hell, yeah.

00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,160
-Yeah. You on my braids.
-Sorry.

563
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:36,540
-What's that smell?
-Smell like barbecue to me.

564
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:39,710
-Y'all smell that?
-What's that?

565
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:47,000
-Shit, look at all them black folks.
-A gang of folks.

566
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:16,870
Come on.

567
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,670
-Get out.
-Quit pushing me.

568
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,510
Barbecue. Come on, girl.

569
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,100
Y'all wait for me. Dang!

570
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:32,440

571
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:36,360
It's cool. It's cool. We gonna eat.
We're family.

572
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,020
Just act like we supposed to be here.

573
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:43,490
-Girl, stop drinking that shit.
-What's wrong with you?

574
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:47,790
Damn, it's hot out here.
My titties is sweating and shit.

575
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:51,170
We shouldn't be here, anyway.

576
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:11,770
-Is that barbecue?
-Looks like barbecue.

577
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:15,190
-Is that free barbecue?
-Shit. It gonna be free.

578
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,910
-We got a gang of freaks here.
-I ain't thinking about these brothers.

579
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:22,620
-What y'all gonna do?
-We gonna eat.

580
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:25,280
You crazy? This ain't your family.

581
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:28,500
-We black. We all family.
-Word.

582
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:32,290
Especially when it comes to barbecue.

583
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:38,000
Lordy, Lordy!
Will you look at the ladies? Hot damn!

584
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:44,940
-We related, huh?
-I hope we're distant relatives.

585
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:46,690
Really?

586
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:50,810
Well, you know,
third and removed don't count.

587
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:53,740
-I don't think so.
-My cousin, my cousin!

588
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:57,910
Look at my family over here.

595
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:24,310
With a lady like this, shit,

596
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:29,030
-What's your name, sweet thing?

00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:02,100
Uncle Herb. Aunt Aida Pearl.
That's Uncle Fred and his wife, Wilma.

605
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:06,110
Cousin Isaac, Cousin James,
Cousin Kwame. What's up, bro?

606
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,580
And them kids, I don't know
all their names. Bread-snatchers.

607
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:15,410
Sitting over here, we got Aunt April,
we got Aunt May and Aunt June.

608
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:18,130
I call them the Calendar Sisters.

609
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:20,530
-Look at them.
-Ain't they pretty?

610
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:25,050
-How y'all doing?
-Yes, sir. How you doing?

611
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,220
Food sure look good over there.

612
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:31,680
Don't it? Go over and help yourself.
You family, ain't you?

613
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:34,770
-It's cool?
-You better go get something.

614
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:38,720
Go ahead with him.
I'm gonna play some cards.

615
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:45,570
Bye. Look at them.
Don't they make such a cute couple?

616
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,630
-Are you all in love?
-Yeah.

617
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,470
Baby, what would you know about love?

618
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,470
Nothing.

619
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,850
How can you be in love
if you don't know nothing about it?

620
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,900
-Just the way things go.
-Are you married?

621
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,390
-Yeah.
-How long you been married?

622
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,190
About six months now.

623
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:23,780
I don't wear it all the time.

624
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:27,700
You don't mind
if she doesn't wear your ring?

625
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:29,150
He don't mind.

626
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:32,460
He can answer for himself,
if he's a real man.

627
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:35,040
Well?

628
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,500
No, no. I don't mind.

629
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:41,050
My husband would kill me
if I didn't wear no ring.

630
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:45,310
-I heard that.
-And I know that's right.

631
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,470
-Damn, you greedy.
-Gotta eat to live.

632
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:54,730
Well, why you so skinny, then?

633
00:57:54,900 --> 00:58:00,320
Look at the cute baby.
Can I hold her for you?

634
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:05,910
Look at you. I heard that.
Give me a burp. That spittle?

635
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,170
You be dating them
professional men, huh?

636
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:12,710
Doctors, lawyers, pharmacists?

637
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:17,590
Street pharmacists?
I knew you was like that.

638
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,850
Here. I'll take her now.

639
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:23,430
She is so cute. You sure?
What's her name?

640
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,730
Her name is lmani.

641
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:32,240
Hi, lmani. Hi there.
You're so cute. Yes, you are.

642
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:37,950
-Thank you.
-Thank you, lmani.

643
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:44,580
So you got a kid, huh?

644
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:51,170
-Why you ask me that?
-Because you look like the type.

645
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:55,680
-And what's the type?
-I don't know.

646
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:59,230
This. You just walking by.
You the type.

647
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:01,850
Anyway...

648
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:04,810
You got any kids?

649
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:08,740
Hell, no, I ain't got no kids.
I don't even like kids.

650
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:11,610
Sure don't look like that to me.

651
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:18,500
This here's kind of cool.

652
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:21,740
You ever been to one of these?

653
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:27,470
No, I ain't got much family.
Family I do have, we ain't this close.

654
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:32,850
I ain't never seen so many black folks
in one spot and there ain't no fight.

655
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:42,820
Let's get back to these
street pharmacists you used to see.

656
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:46,360
Let me tell you something.
I only went out with one.

657
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:52,120
He was my first boyfriend,
my first love. He meant a lot to me.

658
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:58,780
-So you was in it for the money?
-You're getting too damn personal.

659
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:07,930
What the fuck you know? You don't
even keep your fucking nails clean.

660
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:17,150
I want to talk to you about morals.

661
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:22,700
The morals of the young people today
is gonna get them in big trouble.

662
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:26,780
Because they act like
they don't know the difference...

663
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:29,330
...between right and wrong.

664
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:34,040
This is the truth. And one
of the reasons is their parents.

665
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:36,920
Parents are not taking care
of the children.

666
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:41,130
They don't tell them the difference
between right and wrong.

667
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:44,590
Wait now. No, ma'am.
You have to listen.

668
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:48,770
Because part of the responsibility
is the children.

669
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:50,810
Because this is their life.

670
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:55,440
It's not their mama's or papa's.
They have to think for themselves.

671
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:59,740
Even if their mama and papa
didn't do something about it...

672
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:04,730
...the children have to think
and try their best to come on up.

673
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:08,040
-Take this girl here.
-What about her?

674
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:12,330
That child ain't a bit more married
than the man in the moon.

675
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:16,670
-How you doing?
-Fine, how you doing?

676
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:20,840
She's flirting with another man.
Tell me she's married.

677
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,390
-She's young.
-She's loose.

678
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:26,100
She's not loose. You were young once.

679
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:29,610
Yeah, but I was never flitty.
I was never flitty.

680
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:31,730
She was never flitty.

681
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:40,570
I need to talk to my friend.
What's wrong with you?

682
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,660
Chicago gonna kick your ass.

683
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:47,040
-You gonna play cards or sightsee?
-Chicago, come on.

684
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:51,920
-Chicago ain't gonna do shit.
-You stupid? He'll kick your ass.

685
01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:57,470
-You're killing my action, girl. Stop.
-lesha, what action?

686
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,390
-What's up?
-She trippin'.

687
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:03,980
-She ain't doing nothing wrong.
-You got nothing to do with this.

688
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:06,940
-Calm down.
-She know what she's doing.

689
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:10,230
-Come on, girl.
-Wait, don't start nothing.

690
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:15,070
-I'm talking. I'm talking.
-Come on now, don't start fighting.

691
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:19,330
-What's wrong with you, man?
-I can't talk to nobody?

692
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:22,580
What's happening, man?

693
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:28,550
-You mind if I take some food to go?
-No, man. You go ahead.

694
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:30,720
-My cuz!
-Don't you worry.

695
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,430
Something don't look right over here.
I'm gonna have to get in this shit.

696
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,720
-Chicago, stop.
-Try to be cool.

697
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:41,140
-Gonna get his ass.
-We were just talking.

698
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:43,850
Get your hands off me. Shit.

699
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:46,070
-Fuck you.
-Get out of my face.

700
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:49,450
Why you gotta act up
every time we go someplace?

701
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:52,360
-Shut up.
-Why the fuck you gotta act up?

702
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:56,290
What's your problem?
Why the fuck you gotta disrespect me?

703
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:58,330
Fuck you. You don't own me.

704
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:01,920
Fuck you, bitch.
You and your drunk-ass pussy.

705
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:05,800
If I'm a bitch,
then why the fuck you with me?

706
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:09,830
-I don't know why.
-Then leave. Step the fuck off.

707
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:13,930
I don't keep no niggas
when they don't wanna be kept.

708
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:16,890
First of all, you don't keep shit.

709
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,470
All that talking.
Do that shit while you walking.

710
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:24,320
Pull over somewhere. I need
to talk to her. I'm sick of this shit.

711
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:27,360
I'm a black bastard now, right?
I wasn't when I bought you that shit.

712
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:31,740
You was a black bastard then,
and you a black fucking bastard now.

713
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:35,040
-Why the fuck we stopping?
-Good, I gotta pee.

714
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:39,070
You know why you got to pee?
Because you drink too much.

715
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:42,340
Get your hands off me.
I'll pee on your motherfucking ass.

716
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,510
Let me off this shit. I gotta pee.

717
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:50,720
Open the door.
You're gonna have some wet-ass mail.

718
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:53,100
Come here, lesha. I wanna talk to you.

719
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:58,230
What's wrong? Lucky fucking
with you, huh? I'm gonna fuck you up.

720
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:03,640
-Girl, come here. I wanna talk to you.
-Let me put on my jacket.

721
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:13,960
Shit. Look at you.

722
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:18,670
What's up, J?
What's the problem, girl?

723
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:24,080
This is the problem. I'm sick of this.
You act like an alcoholic bitch.

724
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:27,880
-Why you calling me a bitch?
-All you do is get drunk.

725
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:32,190
That's why I never go anyplace
with you. You always acting crazy.

726
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:36,280
Just like my damn mama.

727
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:39,020
I'm sorry.

728
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:43,120
God, I'm sorry, J.

729
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:49,700
It's okay. It's gonna be all right.
You just gotta freeze up on that shit.

730
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:54,550
I didn't know. I swear I didn't know.

731
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:59,090
You're my best friend, though.
I don't wanna hurt you.

732
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:04,850
And I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

733
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:07,060
You just gotta stop.

734
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:11,400
I know. God, I know.

735
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:18,150
Look at me.

736
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,400
I gotta pee.

737
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:25,360
-You old cow, come on.
-You a cow!

738
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:28,500
You're right.
Shit don't change. I told you.

739
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:31,420
Can't give these hoes shit.
They try to break your back.

740
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:42,920
-Still mad at me?
-Come on, it's hot. What's up?

741
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:46,100
I'm sorry, Chicago.

742
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:50,600
-Hey, that's nice. Who's that?
-My cousin Kalil.

743
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:53,900
-That's real nice.
-He write all this shit.

744
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:59,450
I help him with ideas. I'm gonna go
to Oakland and work on this music.

745
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:02,540
It's all right, man.
It ain't all that.

746
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:08,590
Why you always got something negative
to say? At least the nigga's creative.

747
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:11,880
Fuck, he ain't creative.
I'm creative.

748
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:14,430
-What you do?
-I can dress.

749
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:18,890
That's just like a nigga to down-talk
a man 'cause he trying and you ain't.

750
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:22,730
You ain't shit. Post office worker.
No-union-ass nigga.

751
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,860
-You work there too.
-I'm in the union.

752
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:29,610
That don't mean shit. You need a
fashion tip, sweatshirt-wearing ass.

753
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:32,780
Why y'all always fighting?
I thought you were friends.

754
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:35,700
-I just work with him.
-Fuck that nigga.

755
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:39,540
Can I get some air?
Breathing like a goddamn dragon.

756
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:42,030
Anyway...

757
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:53,550
Turn that shit up, man.

758
01:06:56,310 --> 01:07:01,060
A wise man once said,
"Look at the ocean and realize...

759
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:05,900
... that no matter how famous you are
or how much money you make...

760
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:10,070
...know that you'll never be
as important as the ocean. "

761
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,480
Why didn't I go to college?

762
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:17,990
Grandmamma would be rolling over in
her grave two times if she saw me now.

763
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:22,380
I wonder...

764
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:27,390
No, he probably got babies and shit.
Look at him.

765
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:31,850
He looks just like the type that got
a baby stashed away somewheres.

766
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:37,110
Damn, she kind of cute.
Got a nice little frame.

767
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:42,110
Maybe I should get that number,
see how the booty work.

768
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,740
Wonder what Kalil doing.

769
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:49,080
I wonder if my mama picked up
my clothes from the cleaners.

770
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,960
I know what I gotta do
when I get back.

771
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:57,630
I gotta call Terry with his fine ass.
Ask him to take me shopping.

772
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:02,050
I need to just let her ass go.
Fuck it.

773
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:07,270
I can just find me another bitch.
I'm a good-looking nigga.

774
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,600
Got a job. Income coming in.

775
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:13,730
Car. Apartment.

776
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:17,150
My shit is set.

777
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:23,110
Girl, when I get back to L.A.,
I'm quitting Chicago.

778
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:26,290
His tired ass.

779
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:34,550
-lesha, I'm gonna go on a diet.
-A diet?

780
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:38,050
Yeah. My ass is getting too big.

781
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:42,350
I ain't never heard you talking
about going on no diet.

782
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:48,340
I get it. You happy-go-Lucky.

783
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:51,690
-Don't be even trying that shit.
-Yes, you are.

784
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:53,400
No, I don't play that.

785
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,370
Hear them drums?
Where that shit coming from?

786
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:01,080
Who gives a fuck? We ain't stopping.

787
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:33,070
They got some cute shirts over there.

788
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:39,530
What's wrong with you?
Why you so quiet now?

789
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:44,250
Just thinking. I don't really
get a chance to think in the city.

790
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:50,590
This be the only time I can unwind.
Or when I'm with my cousin.

791
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,970
I'm getting tired of all this walking.

792
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:56,010
Yeah, me too, Lucky.

793
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:03,150
What you write about in that notebook?

794
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:05,860
That's my poetry.

795
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:09,150
You trying to say
my cousin's shit ain't poetry?

796
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:13,830
It ain't if he ain't got nothing deep
to say. Gotta have a voice.

797
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:18,370
-A perspective.
-What do you write about?

798
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,790
Whatever's in my heart.

799
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:26,090
And what's that?

800
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:37,230
I don't know. What's in yours?

801
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:41,610
I don't know.
Still trying to find out.

802
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:50,080
Niggas are scared of revolution.
Niggas are nothing but lovers.

803
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:54,080
Man, why we keep stopping?
We got a schedule to keep.

804
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:57,950
We got time. Why you trippin'?
We do this all the time.

805
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:03,970
Because we need to get where we got
to go. Your ass keep procrastinating.

806
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:08,470
You think you slick. Just trying
to gib to that bitch, that's all.

807
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,560
That's your fucking problem.

808
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,880
-Fuck you, limp motherfucker.
-What?

809
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:16,730
-I said, fuck you.
-You better check that bitch.

810
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:21,190
Shit. Gonna get me some plums.

811
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:27,370
You ain't gonna pull that.
She out of your league.

812
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,620
I'm getting tired of your black ass.

813
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:34,320
Man, fuck you.

814
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:37,000
Fuck all of them.

815
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:39,970
Don't need this shit
fucking my day up.

816
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:43,510
But there's one thing about niggas
I do not love.

817
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,970
Niggas are scared of revolution.

818
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,180
Don't eat that. You ain't washed it.

819
01:11:57,070 --> 01:11:59,950
-Yes, I did.
-Where?

820
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:05,740
-You're nasty.
-Want a bite?

821
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:11,710
I don't want none of that dirty plum.
Don't know whose hands been on it.

822
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:14,750
You know you want a bite.

823
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:34,150
-Wanna do something?
-What about them?

824
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,860
-Fuck them.
-All right.

825
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:38,820
All right?

826
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:46,160
How many brothers
and sisters you got?

827
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:49,840
I ain't got no brothers and sisters.

828
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:54,120
My mama didn't have the chance
to have any more kids.

829
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:04,390
lesha. Oh, man.

830
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,490
Shit.

831
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:25,210
-Is that it?
-Give me a couple minutes, all right?

832
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:29,920
Fuck that. A couple minutes, my ass.
You can't even hang that long.

833
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:32,840
-Fuck you.
-That's the problem. You can't.

834
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:37,390
-You the motherfucking problem.
-No, your dick's the problem.

835
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,980
Thought I'd give you something
before I quit your ass...

836
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:44,310
...but you can't even appreciate that.
Can't even do it right.

837
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,810
-Just shut the fuck up.
-Shut up?

838
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:48,240
Yeah. Shut up.

839
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,530
You must be embarrassed.
Is that what it is?

840
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:55,830
Shut the fuck up, all right?
I'm getting sick of this shit.

841
01:13:56,660 --> 01:14:00,000
-Don't come near me.
-What you mean, don't come near you?

842
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:03,210
-Get out of my face.
-How you just gonna leave?

843
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:06,260
You know why I left.
Don't even ask me that.

844
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:09,550
-I don't. Tell me why you left.
-You know why.

845
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:14,770
-You need to take your time and relax.
-You need to. You got the problem.

846
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:18,440
-I ain't got no goddamn problem.
-You got a problem.

847
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,900
Look, don't turn your back on me.

848
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:24,030
-Don't touch me.
-Don't turn your back on me.

849
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:25,900
-I need to.
-Why?

850
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:31,030
'Cause that's the reason the other
bitch left you. You can't hang.

851
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,870
-I can't hang?
-You can't hang.

852
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:37,210
-That's a fucked-up thing to say.
-It's a real thing to say.

853
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:40,880
That's what I get for fucking with
bitches like you. Y'all don't give a fuck.

854
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:44,010
-I don't give a fuck about you.
-No, you don't.

855
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:48,470
I had many niggas that
bought me better shit than you.

856
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,350
-Fuck you.
-Listen to what I got to say.

857
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,090
-Don't touch me.
-Listen to me, then.

858
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:56,310
What do I need to listen to?

859
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,690
How come my shit can't be all like this,
beautiful and shit? You fucked it up.

860
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:03,560
-You ain't a beautiful motherfucker.
-That's fucked up.

861
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:06,370
-I'm tired of arguing.
-Shut up.

862
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:10,490
-Don't turn away from me.
-You know what? You weak.

863
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:12,500
You a weak-ass punk.

864
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:16,710
You think you the shit because
you work out? You ain't buff.

865
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:21,590
I wish I never met your sorry ass.
You a sorry motherfucker.

866
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,510
Yeah, that's right.
Brush that weak-ass fade.

867
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:28,220
Nigga's dick can't
stay hard 5 minutes.

868
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:32,230
What the fuck you do, take steroids?

869
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:39,450
That's the reason why
I'm fucking somebody else.

870
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,730
Motherfucker!
What the fuck do you want?

871
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:10,470
-Calm down.
-You guys stop fighting!

872
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:13,360
-Don't fight with me.
-Leave her alone!

873
01:16:13,530 --> 01:16:17,700
-You ain't gonna do nothing?
-Hell, no. That's their business.

874
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:21,950
-Get off me!
-Shit. You bitch!

875
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:27,000
-How much shit I gotta take off you?
-Get the fuck off of her!

876
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:30,130
Shit!

877
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,680
Hey, motherfucker!

878
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:40,010
-You ain't got shit to do with this.
-Get the fuck off me.

879
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:43,180
-Get the fuck off her. You all right?
-Yeah.

880
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:46,650
-What's wrong with you?
-What's your problem?

881
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:50,570
-She hit me.
-You can't handle it better than that?

882
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:54,690
I'm gonna get Dooky and Monster
to shoot your fucking ass.

883
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:59,120
-They ain't gonna do shit.
-I told you to handle this shit.

884
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:04,580
-Shit wouldn't have been fucked up.
-You just want some pussy, that's all.

885
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:07,090
Fuck!

886
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:10,870
-Get your punk ass up.
-Fucker.

887
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:18,980
You little punk.
Coward motherfucker. Hit a man.

888
01:17:22,150 --> 01:17:27,390
Find a fucking bus, you little punk.
I'm leaving your ass!

889
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:31,350
Don't leave me. Leave them hoes.

890
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:36,410
Walk your ass the 15 miles
to Oakland. Get the fuck off my shit!

891
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:39,580
-But we got a job.
-Get the fuck off my shit!

892
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:41,670
Leave them hoes.

893
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:44,130
Yo, hold on, Lucky.

894
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:48,720
Hey, leave them hoes, man.

895
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,200
Shit.

896
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:14,330
Oh, boy.
This ain't my motherfucking day.

897
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:21,670
I can't believe he hit me.

898
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:25,090
Tired ass.

899
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:31,350
He gonna get fucked up, watch.

900
01:18:32,730 --> 01:18:36,510
Is it true the ribs can tell the kick
Of a beast from a lover's fist?

901
01:18:36,690 --> 01:18:39,940
The bruised bones record it well

902
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:43,240
The sudden shock, the hard impact

903
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,280
Then swollen lids

904
01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:50,080
Sorry eyes spoke not of lost romance
But of hurt

905
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:52,290
Hate is often confused

906
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:55,500
Its limits are in zones beyond itself

907
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:58,630
And sadists will not learn that

908
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:03,790
Love, by nature, extracts a pain
Unequalled on the rack

909
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,810
Why are we stopped?

910
01:19:06,970 --> 01:19:11,730
I don't know. I'll find out, though.

911
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:31,150
They was gonna break up anyway.

912
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:45,960
I remember when I was little...

913
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:50,120
...and my uncle Leon
used to come around.

914
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:56,180
He used to give me
and my cousins change.

915
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:03,480
He'd go to the liquor store
and buy a 40-ounce of beer.

916
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:06,820
Always throw us the change.

917
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:14,110
I'd always ask for the big nickel.

918
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:19,120
I couldn't pronounce "quarter, "
so that's what I called it.

919
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:33,810
Look at your nails.
Give me your hand.

920
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:37,270
Come on, give me your hand.

921
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:45,740
Anyway, so because of that,
my grandmamma used to say...

922
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:49,990
...I was always looking
for the big nickel.

923
01:21:57,580 --> 01:22:01,710
-That's before she died.
-When did she die?

924
01:22:03,170 --> 01:22:06,260
About two years ago.

925
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:10,430
She left me the house.

926
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:25,230
When I was 12,
my mama committed suicide.

927
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:37,670
She named me Justice
because she was in law school...

928
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:41,340
...when she was pregnant with me.

929
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:51,520
I'm all alone now, though.

930
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:58,600
I got a cat. Cute little cat.

931
01:22:59,530 --> 01:23:01,320
Damn.

932
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:28,370
Give me your hand

933
01:24:28,550 --> 01:24:33,540
Make room for me to lead and follow you
Beyond this rage of poetry

934
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:36,680
Let others have privacy
Of touching words

935
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:39,140
And love of loss of love

936
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:43,520
For me, give me your hand

937
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:57,290
Look, I gotta tell you something.

938
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:05,760
Shit, don't tell me you got something.

939
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:10,890
No. I'm only telling you this
because I care about you...

940
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:15,010
...and I think you should know
before we go any further.

941
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,720
A little girl, huh?

942
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:47,220
Why didn't you tell me
in the beginning?

943
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:53,480
I mean, how was I supposed
to know what we was doing?

944
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,820
I'm gonna go check on my cousin.

945
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:10,790
Aunt Audrey. Kalil.

946
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:15,090
Aunt Audrey. Kalil.

947
01:26:36,030 --> 01:26:38,860
Hey, where do you think you're going?

948
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:43,450
-Kalil!
-Shit, man, it's his cousin!

949
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:49,370
-Yo, man, somebody shot Kalil.
-Who shot him?

950
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:53,250
What relationship is
this woman to him?

951
01:26:55,630 --> 01:26:58,890
Just get away from me, man!

952
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:04,520
Cover him up, man! Cover him up!
What the fuck are you doing?

953
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:51,630
-What's up? What room we in?
-What happened to you?

954
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:04,110
Don't touch me.

955
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:08,370
If I had got there on time,
this never would have happened.

956
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:13,000
Instead of fucking with you.

957
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:16,500
What?

958
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:05,350
So we scraping the bottom
of the pudding cup now, huh?

959
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:10,020
Know what you talking about
before you judge.

960
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:13,480
Well, excuse me. I'm sorry.

961
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:19,100
You even walk different.

962
01:30:21,410 --> 01:30:27,370
Let's go, fellas, all right?
I don't got all day. Watch your head.

963
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:30,380
I thought there was gonna
be two of you.

964
01:30:32,090 --> 01:30:34,760
No, it's just me.

965
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:39,470
-See you the next time around.
-No, I don't think so.

966
01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:44,560
You don't fight no man with your fist.
You fight him in his wallet.

967
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:49,690
Instead of swinging at him,
you should have gave him some.

968
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:53,780
Wait till he went to sleep
and took that credit card.

969
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:57,280
-And we all would have had a party.
-On him!

970
01:30:57,450 --> 01:31:01,490
What credit card?
That nigga ain't got no credit card.

971
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:04,790
-No credit cards?
-Shit, then you is a fool.

972
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:06,940
-I'm telling you, men ain't shit.
-Ain't that the truth.

973
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:10,450
Excuse me?
I thought you were in love.

974
01:32:10,610 --> 01:32:14,570
Well, you thought wrong.
Don't be assuming shit, okay?

975
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:18,120
When you assume,
you make an ass out of you.

976
01:32:18,290 --> 01:32:23,170
Well, you were already an ass.
You got a lot to learn about the world.

977
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:29,050
Come on, y'all.
Let's go get a drink.

978
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:33,640
These little girls don't know
their cooch from a hole in the wall.

979
01:32:33,810 --> 01:32:36,810
-But they gonna learn.
-You got that right.

980
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:41,020
'Cause all I do is dress and rest.

981
01:32:41,190 --> 01:32:45,490
-'Cause love don't live here anymore.
-Come on, Jessie.

982
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:47,890
Morning, Lawrence. You hungry, baby?
Come here and get something to eat.

983
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:50,600
I ain't hungry.

984
01:33:51,110 --> 01:33:53,940
Too mad to eat.

985
01:33:55,280 --> 01:34:00,610
Audrey. Audrey, sit down. Sit down.
You gonna wear yourself out.

986
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:18,340
Lawrence.

987
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:25,980
Shante, check that chicken, baby.

988
01:34:26,350 --> 01:34:28,980
Make sure it don't burn.

989
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:34,610
Lawrence.

990
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:40,540
I want you to know,
you my favourite nephew.

991
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:46,910
Your mama and l, even though we're
sisters, we don't always get along.

992
01:34:48,420 --> 01:34:53,050
But I was always happy that
you and Kalil were like brothers.

993
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:57,640
Family's got to stick together,
no matter what.

994
01:35:01,350 --> 01:35:06,860
Aunt Audrey, I know you're probably
not thinking about this right now.

995
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:10,280
Probably ain't important to y'all.

996
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:16,330
But it's important to me...

997
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:20,710
...to know what you're gonna do
with the equipment.

998
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:23,500
We gonna sell it. We need the money.

999
01:35:23,670 --> 01:35:26,380
Why don't you mind your business?

1000
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:31,140
He put every dollar he had into that
equipment. You just gonna fuck it up?

1001
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:34,720
-Watch your mouth.
-I'm serious. You know he did.

1002
01:35:34,890 --> 01:35:38,020
What you think we should do?

1003
01:35:39,690 --> 01:35:44,440
Give it to me.
I'll do something with it.

1004
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:47,900
I'll do what he would
have wanted me to do.:

1005
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:50,320
Use it.

1006
01:35:50,910 --> 01:35:55,000
Tell Annie I said " hi." And I love you.

1007
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:57,620
I love you too.

1008
01:37:07,790 --> 01:37:10,540
Pretty women wonder
Where my secret lies

1009
01:37:10,710 --> 01:37:14,380
I'm not cute
Or built to suit a fashion model's size

1010
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:18,880
But when I start to tell them
They think I'm telling lies

1011
01:37:19,050 --> 01:37:23,430
I say, it's the reach of my arms
The span of my hips

1012
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:26,770
The stride of my step
The curl of my lips

1013
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:32,520
I'm a woman, phenomenally
Phenomenal woman, that's me

1014
01:37:32,690 --> 01:37:36,310
I walk into a room
Just as cool as you please

1015
01:37:36,490 --> 01:37:41,560
And to a man, the fellows stand
Or they fall down to their knees

1016
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:45,280
Then they swarm around me
Like a hive of honey bees

1017
01:37:45,450 --> 01:37:50,370
I say, it's the fire in my eyes
The flash of my teeth

1018
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:53,920
The swing in my waist
And the joy in my feet

1019
01:37:54,090 --> 01:37:59,390
I'm a woman, phenomenally
Phenomenal woman, that's me

1020
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:06,310
-Damn!
-Daddy, could we go to the store?

1021
01:38:06,730 --> 01:38:10,510
Go in the living room.
It's too dangerous in here.

1022
01:38:12,570 --> 01:38:15,910
Men themselves have wondered
What they see in me

1023
01:38:16,070 --> 01:38:20,790
They try so much
But they can't touch my inner mystery

1024
01:38:20,950 --> 01:38:25,000
When I try to show them
They still can't see

1025
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:29,550
I say, it's the arch of my back
The sun of my smile

1026
01:38:29,710 --> 01:38:33,090
The ride of my breasts
And the grace of my style

1027
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:40,020
I'm a woman, phenomenally
Phenomenal woman, that's me

1028
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:06,670
Now you understand
Just why my head's not bowed

1029
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:11,010
I don't have to shout or jump about
Or have to talk real loud

1030
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:14,850
When you see me passing
It ought to make you proud

1031
01:39:15,010 --> 01:39:19,640
I say, it's the click of my heels
The bend of my hair

1032
01:39:19,810 --> 01:39:23,190
The palm of my hand
The need for my care

1033
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:29,530
I'm a woman, phenomenally
Phenomenal woman, that's me

1034
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:52,470
Don't look at me.

1035
01:39:56,390 --> 01:40:00,100
Look at her. Sitting over there
in that cheap dress.

1036
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:04,230
-Acting like she don't know you.
-She know who I am.

1037
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:07,570
-Plastic Payless shoes.
-Cheap-ass weave.

1038
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:12,710
Ain't even human hair.
The bitch got yak hair in her head.

1039
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:15,580
Is there a problem?

1040
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:18,590
If you don't quit staring,
I'm gonna slap you.

1041
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:23,010
We're not having that here.
You take it to the street.

1042
01:40:23,180 --> 01:40:26,880
-We could take it out.
-Don't you mess with my man!

1043
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:31,390
Remember this: Every time
you kiss him, you tasting my pussy.

1044
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:35,430
-You got to go!
-That's wrong.

1045
01:40:35,650 --> 01:40:39,780
-Please, darling, cool it down.
-She need to whup her ass.

1046
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:42,520
None of that!

1047
01:40:42,740 --> 01:40:45,870
I'm kind of tired too.
Watch yourself.

1048
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:50,030
What's up?

1049
01:40:54,630 --> 01:40:58,800
-How much is it? Twenty-five?
-Yeah.

1050
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:06,720
Thanks. Excuse me.

1051
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:13,400
-What's up?
-Who's this?

1052
01:41:13,570 --> 01:41:18,530
-Keisha.
-Hi, Keisha. My name is Justice.

1053
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:22,990
-Can we sit down for a few minutes?
-Yeah, sure.

1054
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:31,130
-She's so cute.
-This is my baby.

1055
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:35,580
Look...

1056
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:44,100
It took me a long time
to come down here.

1057
01:41:44,270 --> 01:41:49,150
I mean, I know I made a mistake.

1058
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:52,190
But everybody make mistakes.

1059
01:41:54,490 --> 01:41:57,620
And I had a lot on my mind.

1060
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:00,740
I'm sorry.

1061
01:42:01,870 --> 01:42:04,830
I apologize.

1062
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,410
Forgive me?

1063
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:12,160
Come here.
I wanna whisper something to you.

1064
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:16,640
Get the fuck out of here.
I ain't falling for that again.

1065
01:42:17,510 --> 01:42:20,230
No, for real, though. Come here.

1066
01:42:20,390 --> 01:42:23,440
Come here. Come here.

1067
01:42:31,610 --> 01:42:33,660
Oh, my God!

1068
01:42:40,620 --> 01:42:43,710
Your nails are clean.

1069
01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:48,760
-I wonder why.
-They living a fairy tale.

1070
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:52,300
-What are y'all looking at?
-I wouldn't have forgiven you.

1071
01:42:52,470 --> 01:42:55,310
-What have you done with her head?
-Nothing.

1072
01:42:55,470 --> 01:42:59,640
That's just what it look like too.
Come on, let me fix your hair.

1073
01:42:59,810 --> 01:43:03,320
-Her hair look fine.
-Come on. It's a mess.

1074
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:08,600
-I guess my assumption was right.
-Ain't wearing black no more either.

1075
01:43:08,780 --> 01:43:12,620
They make an all right couple.
But he's not my type.

1076
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:17,700
-Kind of cute, though.
-Nice nose.

1077
01:43:17,910 --> 01:43:21,670
There's a few things
we could do with your hair.

1078
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:27,380
We can put some ponytails in it
and huge flower ribbons. Or barrettes.

1079
01:43:27,590 --> 01:43:33,230
Or we can put
some big, big, big curls in it.

1080
01:43:33,390 --> 01:43:37,230
Big locks.
Which way would you like it?

1081
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:41,180
-Curls.
-You like the curls? The curls, okay.

1082
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:44,780
-Do you go to school, Keisha?
-Yeah.

1083
01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:48,280
-You do? You like school?
-Yeah.

1084
01:43:48,450 --> 01:43:51,330
-What's your teacher's name?
-Mrs. Frazier.

1085
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:53,500
Mrs. Frazier?
