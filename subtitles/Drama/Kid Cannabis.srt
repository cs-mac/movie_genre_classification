1
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,801
Beautiful. Isn't it?

2
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,203
But listen. You hear it?

3
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,759
I hear it in my nightmares.

4
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,319
That's the sound of the feds,

5
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,799
working their unmanned drones, spending
more money trying to shut us down

6
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,359
than they did searching
for Osama Bin Laden.

7
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,769
42 billion spent in the war on pot.

8
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,159
140 bucks from every one of you

9
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,479
to fight a little green herb made
by God that grows in the sun.

10
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,648
And God doesn't make mistakes.

11
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,043
Go! Go go go!

12
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,759
I would have personally
paid 18 million in taxes

13
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,964
on the almost 60 million I
made from the medicine I sold.

14
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,683
But they never asked,
so I never offered.

15
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,367
I never got the bill,
so I didn't pay.

16
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,519
Here's the skinny.

17
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,199
I was a spongy kid from the
wrong side of the lake.

18
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,199
A high school dropout.
The lost cause.

19
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,364
The invisible kid whose name you
forget before I even finish saying it.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,319
But I ran a disciplined,
$68 million a year business

21
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,161
and employed hundreds of Wal-Mart-
shopping, exxon-buying Americans.

22
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,759
And we'd still be up and running,

23
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,519
trying to cope with the
demand, if murder and mayhem

24
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,371
hadn't entered the picture.
But hey,

25
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,083
you can't put the toothpaste
back in the tube, can you?

26
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,088
Topher moved to Idaho from
Boston when he was 15.

27
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,927
He took a lot of shit for his Boston
accent and for being full of shit.

28
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,279
But he's had my back ever since
he beat down Billy "the bull" Turrow,

29
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,802
who used to give me a daily thumping
for as long as I can remember.

30
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,399
We had one big thing in common.
Pot.

31
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,199
Talking about it, smoking it,
looking for more, better, cheaper.

32
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,970
You know the deal.

33
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,319
He liked getting high
almost as much as I did,

34
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,159
and that is saying a lot.

35
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,439
You can't believe half the shit
that comes out of his mouth,

36
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,759
but Topher had game. He'd get me to do
things I would have never done on my own.

37
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,644
He was my best fro.

38
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,599
What's up, motherfuckers?

39
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,479
Is this a party?

40
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,439
If I could erase one guy from this
story, it would be Brendan Butler.

41
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,799
He lost the plot years ago. Went to sleep
on the dirt floor of a Korean orphanage,

42
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,839
woke up in a mansion
in Coeur D'alene lake

43
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,679
with a silver spoon up his ass.

44
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,799
But no good deed goes unpunished.

45
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,719
He paid his adopted
daddy Warbucks back

46
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,119
by becoming the biggest, baddest,
loudest drug dealer in town.

47
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,959
Dealt his overpriced weed to
the frat pack at Gonzaga prep.

48
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,004
Us public school kids got
the sticks and seeds.

49
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,639
People talk about him being
an honors student, perfect S.A.T. Scores.

50
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,479
But he did some of
the stupidest shit I'd ever seen.

51
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,524
He was always talking
when he should have been listening.

52
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,484
Do you think people
will know what I am?

53
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,079
Who cares? The chicks
will have to ask, right?

54
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,519
Foot in the door,
dick in the whore.

55
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,119
Just let me do the talking.
I'll get us in.

56
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,999
- All right.
- Nate? Is that you?

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,159
- Hey, Ashli with an "I."
- It's me. How are you?

58
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,919
I'm great. What are you?

59
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,639
I'm... he's the floor
of a movie theater.

60
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,719
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Funny.

61
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,559
Cute. What are you?

62
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,199
I'm a leaf blower. Get it?

63
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,359
Creative. Original.

64
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,639
- What are you?
- French maid.

65
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,759
Yeah, never seen that before.
What are you supposed to be?

66
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,121
A cat.

67
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,199
- Girl scout.
- Do you have any cookies?

68
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,599
- Not for you.
- Okay, cool.

69
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,559
Fuck off. Let's go.
Sweet push-up bra.

70
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,650
I hate those bitches.
Fucking skanks.

71
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,679
Go ahead, compliments
of Brendan Butler.

72
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,881
Here you go.

73
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,088
No. Hold on. Hold up.

74
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,559
- I'm cool with Wang.
- Uh, Brendan Butler, sir.

75
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,199
- Yeah, Brendan.
- Hold up.

76
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,322
Really?

77
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,561
What?

78
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,401
Wang?

79
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,770
Who the fuck thinks
they can call me Wang?

80
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,239
Huh? Who the fuck thinks
they can call me Wang?

81
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,399
These two fucking clowns.

82
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,762
I'm a friend of, uh, Daniel Cox.

83
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,490
This isn't Daniel
Cox's fucking party.

84
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,999
- Yeah. He told us about it.
- It's all good, right? Just...

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,248
- Told you about it?
- Got some bud.

86
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,691
Oh, you got some bud? I got these.

87
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,159
Get the fuck out of here before
I ventilate you in your...

88
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,283
Fucking pussy bitch. Pussy?

89
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,839
Who's a pussy bitch?

90
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,804
You're a fucking pussy bitch.

91
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,599
I don't know if freako Bandito
was really shooting at us,

92
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,479
but I wasn't looking
back to find out.

93
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,879
- Don't fuck with me.
- You fucking prick.

94
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,368
Nice fucking costume. Fuck you.

95
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,967
Hey.

96
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,889
Can we make this a four-way?

97
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,160
But the truth was,
we were both losers by legacy.

98
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,486
I went to bed sick and tired
of being sick and tired.

99
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,919
Tired of my mom
working shitty jobs,

100
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,719
driving a shitty car,
living in a shitty house,

101
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,208
just to provide three hots and a
cot for me and my little bro.

102
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,048
But every chunk of coal wants
to be a diamond, right?

103
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,361
You want to know what I think
is wrong with pot? Nothing.

104
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,079
Would you rather be in a room
full of drunks or pot smokers?

105
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,359
Give me the pot smokers every time.

106
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,289
Laid back and friendly.

107
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,888
When was the last time a bar fight
broke out between potheads?

108
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,399
Drive drunk, you think you're doing
30 and you're really doing 90.

109
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,639
Drive high, you think you're doing 90
and you're really doing 30.

110
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,999
You stop at red lights twice.

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,639
Mother nature produces pot.
Man makes liquor.

112
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,719
Who do you trust? Seriously, the pizza
I used to deliver's killed more people

113
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,402
than all the weed ever
smoked in the state of Idaho.

114
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,722
- Mom awake?
- I don't know.

115
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,759
- You do your homework?
- Yeah.

116
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,122
- You really do your homework?
- Yeah.

117
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,922
All right. Here you go, buddy.

118
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,600
Mom?

119
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,044
Ma, it's time to get up.

120
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,164
Time to get up. Come on.

121
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,402
- What time is it?
- 7:45. You gotta go to work.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,759
I'd been working minimum wage
since I was a stem cell,

123
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,119
and it sucks in every
way and always will.

124
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,639
Delivering pizzas, shoveling
snow, bagging groceries,

125
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,479
trimming trees, whatever
I could hustle.

126
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,239
In Coeur D'alene, there was money
all around, but just out of reach.

127
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,919
Teasing, taunting, just
laughing at you for thinking

128
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,441
you were gonna get your
hands on any of it.

129
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,171
Pizza.

130
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,241
Come in!

131
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,326
Down the hall.

132
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,845
Uh, hi.

133
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,159
Thought they were sending
the redhead, uh...

134
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,519
- Jennifer.
- Yeah, Jennifer, that's her.

135
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,079
- The redhead, big tits.
- Yeah. I...

136
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,999
I mean, she-she's off. I'm Nate.

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,123
Hello, Nate.

138
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,651
It's 22.30.

139
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,399
Got change for a hun?

140
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,921
Uh, no, I can't. Sorry.

141
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,363
Okay, hold your horses.

142
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,322
Hey! Any of you
butt-heads got twenties?

143
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,483
Okay, excellent, thanks for your help.
I really appreciate that.

144
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,683
Get your hand off your nut sac.

145
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,682
- Do you believe these guys, huh?
- Yeah.

146
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,319
- You, uh, want a hit?
- Oh, no, I can't.

147
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,965
I gotta get back to work.

148
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,371
Like you'd hate to lose
this dream job, huh?

149
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,122
'Cause passing that pizza jockey
bar exam's a real bitch, huh?

150
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,405
Okay, excuse me.

151
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,844
All right. Turn your
head, little man.

152
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,039
You're about to see
what makes most women

153
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,925
fear the cock. Okay.

154
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,765
Get in there.

155
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,519
Haha. Oh, easy, speed racer.
That there's the B.C. Bud.

156
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,449
That's 600 a half
if you can find it.

157
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,844
600 a half?

158
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,479
Holy shit. Sorry.

159
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,364
Yes, it is.

160
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,719
You see the ground squirrel
on the bed there?

161
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,879
She bought herself a divorce,
a new set of tits,

162
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,759
and put her kid through
private school,

163
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,199
all by bringing down a
few pounds every month.

164
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,719
Down from where?

165
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,079
- From Canada, bro.
- How?

166
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,159
Don't get me wrong, tight
pussy is very, very nice,

167
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,089
but it's a little overrated.

168
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,289
That chick's kid's head?
The size of fucking Charlie brown.

169
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,885
In her box?

170
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,241
Really?

171
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,201
- All right, give me a second.
- All right.

172
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,323
I-I-I... here we go.
Um, all I have is a 20.

173
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,125
It's 22.30.

174
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,449
Can you break a Benjamin?

175
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,804
Then all I have is a 20.

176
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,801
Huh? We got a deal, Nate?

177
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,679
Thank you. There you go, sir.

178
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,042
Let me grab that. It's a write-off.

179
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,171
Now, shouldn't you be toodling
off back to pizza base camp?

180
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,481
Hmm?

181
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,479
Good to meet you, Nate.

182
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,921
Say hi to the big-titted
redhead for me.

183
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,240
Girls!

184
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,809
We got pie. Woo!

185
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,719
It was like I'd been living
my entire life in a fog,

186
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,002
and that night it finally lifted.

187
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,324
Like Donald trump says,

188
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,803
"if you want to make money,
stick with what you love and know."

189
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,119
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, ma. You're late.

190
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,159
Yeah. Some yuppies ran
out on their bill,

191
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,011
and Randy made me wash
dishes to cover their check.

192
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,680
Sucks.

193
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,201
Hey. You need to get some sleep.

194
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,687
- Good night, mom.
- Good night, baby.

195
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,839
Yes? Okay.

196
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,281
Tom? Tom.

197
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,889
Mr. Loya can see you now.

198
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,722
- First office to your right.
- Thank you.

199
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,526
Come in.

200
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,526
Come in.

201
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,005
Close the door there, yeah.

202
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,562
- I'm Joe Loya.
- Hi. Tom Clark. Pleasure.

203
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,046
Take it off.

204
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,449
- Take what off?
- The mask.

205
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,766
Okay.

206
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,719
I'm... I'm sorry.

207
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,129
I didn't want to be seen.
I'm a little nervous.

208
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,921
Sorry. Didn't mean
to weird you out.

209
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,439
So?

210
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,371
So. What can I do for you today?

211
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,848
Uh, marijuana.

212
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,079
I have a friend who...
kind of a friend,

213
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,645
that he or she

214
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,399
may-may-may be interested

215
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,968
in, uh, in the business.

216
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,239
So, you want to know how much time you
would do if you get popped dealing weed.

217
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,842
Um, not-not dealing. Transporting.

218
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,724
- Not-not me, though.
- Trafficking?

219
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,725
Yeah, but once again,
not me, my friend.

220
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,244
Uh, might be doing it.

221
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,205
- Maybe.
- Well, there are a lot of variables.

222
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,439
How much weight?
Are you crossing state lines?

223
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,079
Are you carrying a firearm?
Is this a federal case or a state case?

224
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,639
If it's a state case,
which state and who's the judge?

225
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,205
Do you have any priors?

226
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,439
The critical element in
whether you walk away

227
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,679
or you're there to stay
is have you stashed enough money

228
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,166
to pay my fee?

229
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,128
Oh. Okay.

230
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,047
Okay.

231
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,767
How much weed do you think
was sold in America last year?

232
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,479
I don't know. Not enough.

233
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,250
Come on, man. How much?

234
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,524
- 2 million pounds.
- No.

235
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,319
- 50 million pounds?
- No. No.

236
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,488
- I don't know. How much?
- All of it.

237
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,764
I mean, the market is huge.
It's infinite.

238
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,839
And you know who sells the sweetest,
dankest purple-hair buds

239
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,279
in the whole Western world? What's
with the 20 freaking questions?

240
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,239
Dude, man, Canada. Every ma and
pa kettle in Canada's a grower.

241
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,364
- You want to know why?
- No, Nate. Enlighten me.

242
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,839
If you get caught growing, slap on
the wrist. Nobody gives a shit.

243
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,123
It's like a speeding ticket
or an overdue library book.

244
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,722
- We don't live in Canada.
- It's a hundred miles away, dude.

245
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,204
- The border's wide open.
- The border's n...

246
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,559
If the border's wide open, why
did Ronnie price get popped

247
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,359
with a half a pound coming home from
a hockey tournament in Vancouver?

248
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,291
Dumbass, I'm not talking about
driving it across the border.

249
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,245
What are you talking about?

250
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,239
I'm talking about walking across the
5,000 miles they're not watching.

251
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,039
- You think that they're not watching.
- I know they're not watching.

252
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,999
Okay. My dad says if
anyone deals with drugs,

253
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,039
you better get rich quick, because
you're gonna get caught in the end.

254
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,323
Oh, yeah? You know
what my dad says?

255
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,928
Nothing, 'cause I don't have one,
so I gotta make it on my own.

256
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,044
I'm talking about pot here.

257
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,839
Thomas Jefferson and
George Washington grew it.

258
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,879
Columbus's sails were made out of it.
I mean, even the first pair of Levis

259
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,159
- were made out of it, man.
- You talk so much shit for a kid

260
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,599
who didn't graduate high school.

261
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,039
I'm saying we could
bring in a few pounds,

262
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,199
offload it in, what,
5 and a half seconds?

263
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,399
Get the 50 large we need to
open that custom bike shop

264
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,204
we've always been talking about.

265
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,079
Keep it small, just between us.

266
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,931
In and out, short and
sweet, we eat and treat.

267
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,879
Yeah, but you know how much time
we would do if we got caught?

268
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,119
I know exactly how much time.

269
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,563
Keep it under 5 pounds,
no weapons, no priors?

270
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,770
We'd do a year.
Be out in 4 months.

271
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,964
Wow. You've been chewing
on this for a while, huh?

272
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,488
Yeah, a while.

273
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,479
Pop that pussy

274
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,279
full of poppy

275
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,799
lunch at Nobu bring hot sake

276
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,729
go with me on Kawasakis

277
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,370
do you even know where we're going?

278
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,039
North. This way.

279
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,366
Come on.

280
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,644
So that's it, huh?
That's the border?

281
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,559
There's got to be a camera or some
motion detectors or some shit.

282
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,604
Let's find out. On my 3.

283
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,846
1, 2, 3, go.

284
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,719
- What the hell?
- Sorry, sorry, my foot got stuck.

285
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,641
Yeah, let's go again. Ready?
1, 2, 3, go.

286
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,839
I'd never ran as fast
as I did that day.

287
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,159
We ran like Kenyan
track stars on meth.

288
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,570
Like we were being chased by H.I.V-positive,
flesh-eating zombies on motocross bikes.

289
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,799
We were just waiting for
the sirens to go off,

290
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,039
the helicopters to come
swooping out of the sky,

291
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,319
for the lasers and ninjas
with searchlights.

292
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,726
Waiting for all the shit to fly out
of the sky, but surprise, surprise,

293
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,371
it never did.

294
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,839
- What do you think?
- I have no idea, man.

295
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,769
- Is it Canada?
- Could be.

296
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,451
Can't see any fucking cars.

297
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,284
Fuck it. Let's go. Come on.

298
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,483
Where the fuck are we?

299
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,764
- Dude.
- What?

300
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,844
It's in kilometers.

301
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,959
- So?
- We're in Canada, man!

302
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,241
- Really?
- Yes!

303
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,287
Wait. Go.

304
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,559
We needed startup capital,

305
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,919
so we went back to the lake
and found a sunken jet boat

306
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,559
in, like, 10 seconds.

307
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,764
The magic boat that
no one thought really existed.

308
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,319
Some sucker peeled off
the 1800 we were asking,

309
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,679
and boom, boom, boom,
we were knocking at the door

310
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,759
of the "A" room.
Financing in place,

311
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,079
route laid out.

312
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,124
Now, to get higher,
all we needed was a supplier.

313
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,199
Just be cool. Just
keep it cool, buddy.

314
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,721
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good. I got this.

315
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,159
Besides, we don't have
anything on us, so we're fine.

316
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,045
Relax. I've got it under control.

317
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,039
- Hello.
- See some I.D.

318
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,723
Sure. Not-not a very
good looking picture.

319
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,879
Dude, shut up. You as well.

320
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,286
Here you go.

321
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,449
Did you check the N.C.I.C.?

322
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,525
Where you boys headed?

323
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,400
Canada.

324
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,004
What part of Canada?

325
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,119
The inside part. Creston.

326
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,687
Yeah. We're just going to
visit some friends.

327
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,519
Any drugs or alcohol
in the vehicle?

328
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,119
Oh, no. I mean, we sold them
all to get this sweet ride.

329
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,319
0 to 60 in 3 days.
You feel?

330
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,601
Dude.

331
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,685
Take the left on your way out. Pull over
into the secondary inspection area.

332
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,999
- Really?
- Do I look like I'm joking?

333
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,964
- Shut up.
- All right.

334
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,719
- I'm sorry.
- The fuck is wrong with you, trying to be funny?

335
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,959
It was a dumb joke. Trying to
be a fucking comedian.

336
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,879
You're not funny.
It's pathetic. I'm sorry.

337
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,239
Get your sweaty shit together, man.
I'm not doing this with you

338
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,479
- if you're gonna be a fucking idiot.
- I'm nervous, okay?

339
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,842
Well, just shut up,
don't say anything.

340
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,050
Step out of the car, please.

341
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,479
- Everything okay?
- Yep, just head to the front of the vehicle, please.

342
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,761
All right.

343
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,679
There's nothing in the
fucking car, right?

344
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,159
- Nothing.
- You sure?

345
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,646
- I'm positive.
- All right.

346
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,765
What's this, guys?

347
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,719
Uh, that's a paintball gun, sir.

348
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,365
Why just one?

349
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,848
I don't-I don't play
paintball, sir.

350
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,359
All right, guys. Empty your pockets

351
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,679
for me, please, on the table.

352
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,406
I need you to take your socks
and shoes off, please.

353
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,879
Probably smell bad, but...

354
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,242
Shirts and shorts for me, please.

355
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,851
Ahh.

356
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,725
This is the fun part.

357
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,719
Which way?

358
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,919
Let me see. We go...
it says 3.7 miles

359
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,805
- to the main road.
- Miles or kilometers?

360
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,999
Oh, k... I don't know.
It doesn't say.

361
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,279
Well, that's kind of
a big difference.

362
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,847
- Kilometers or miles?
- All right, we'll figure it out.

363
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,759
- Where is it?
- Right up ahead.

364
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,803
This corner? Oh, right here.

365
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,046
Hey.

366
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,361
Morning.

367
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,683
There's no fucking way.

368
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,007
All righty, there you go, man.
Have a great day.

369
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,959
- What's up, dude?
- Hey, man.

370
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,639
- My name's Ted.
- Hey, Ted.

371
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,839
- Ted.
- Topher.

372
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,159
Topher? Nate Norman.

373
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,479
Nate. Pleasure.

374
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,079
Pleased to meet you guys.
Well, how can I help you?

375
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,839
Well, um, looking to get some bud.

376
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,919
No doubt. Okay, we've got
the sativas over here at this end,

377
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,479
and they're a really good head stone,
really uplifting kind of high,

378
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,359
make you want to go to the park and
run through and look at the flowers.

379
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,279
- We like getting high.
- And then, uh,

380
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,119
over here it's the indicas, which
are kind of like the body stones,

381
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,119
which, kind of like
wheelchair weed.

382
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,159
What's your favorite strain, Ted?

383
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,719
I love the king Kong, man.
Got a really nice burn to it.

384
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,759
You know, a lot of growers don't flush out the
fertilizer enough, and it makes you cough.

385
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,439
It's kind of harsh. The king Kong
it's got this beautiful burn.

386
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,559
- Really nice and potent, just...
- Can we smell the king Kong?

387
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,569
- Yeah.
- Yeah, for sure.

388
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,571
- And the...
- Oh, my God.

389
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,359
Some of the finest
herb in B.C. Here.

390
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,370
- Wow.
- Yep, that'll get you high just smelling it.

391
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,928
- Smells like tinkerbell's wings.
- Haha.

392
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,199
- How much...
- Yeah, how much does it cost?

393
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,925
We have 1800 bucks.

394
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,879
No, man, we don't
sell quantity here.

395
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,199
We're retail, not wholesale.

396
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,399
I think we should still...
Probably get some, yeah.

397
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,359
Well, check it out. Holy cow.

398
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,130
- Just walk away.
- Pardon?

399
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,445
Bail. Bail.

400
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,048
Look around. This place
is crawling with D.E.A.

401
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,239
They got the whole place
under surveillance.

402
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,842
You buy here, try and
get it back into the U.S. of a.,

403
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,566
you're facing federal
smuggling charges.

404
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,487
No parole in federal prison.

405
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,770
Walky walky.

406
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,600
Come on.

407
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,521
Take a right. Right right right.

408
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,279
How far away are we
from this place?

409
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,290
- About 5, 10 blocks.
- Oh, great.

410
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,759
So, do you grow your
own shit, or...

411
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,486
Uh, it's a plant. It grows itself.

412
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,439
All right, take a right up here.

413
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,928
- All right, man, just park.
- Anywhere. All right.

414
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,164
Come on, come on, come on.

415
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,925
Watch your step.

416
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,479
My lady cut her finger.

417
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,920
Couple times.

418
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,519
All right, 1800 U.S.

419
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,799
Can we smoke a blunt first?

420
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,279
I just saved your ass and
you're trying to test me?

421
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,289
- Give me the money.
- Uh, okay.

422
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,439
You guys gotta go now.
Go! Go now. Go.

423
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,165
Run! Go!

424
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,161
This shit's like Mexican
goat fuckers' weed, man.

425
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,719
It's not worth me carrying it
across the border.

426
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,479
Yeah, well, did you get
a receipt from that guy?

427
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,999
'Cause maybe we can ask him
for a refund or some shit.

428
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,201
No.

429
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,399
Major Tom to ground
control. Do you copy?

430
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,159
Yes, Mr. Fuckface, I can hear you.

431
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,599
All right. So, I'll pick you up
in 3 hours.

432
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,519
Meet you at mile 8
on millstone Lane.

433
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,639
Stay in the woods till
I come get you. Got it? All right.

434
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,079
- Wait. Wait wait wait.
- What?

435
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,839
- Why am I carrying it?
- Don't start now.

436
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,361
- I'm just asking.
- You're older than me.

437
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,999
- Exactly.
- You're in better shape.

438
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,959
You can obviously
use the fucking exercise.

439
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,679
- It's my car.
- I can drive.

440
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,239
- You can't drive stick.
- Yes, I can.

441
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,959
No, you can't. It's not
fucking stick, Nate.

442
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,639
- I'm afraid of bears.
- Like I'm fucking not?

443
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,919
It's already decided, man.
You're in the suit and gear.

444
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,119
- All right.
- I'll do it next time, okay?

445
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,402
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Fucking right you will.

446
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,721
Jesus.

447
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,370
Fuck. Where the fuck am I?

448
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,199
While Topher was trying to figure out if
the earth's magnetic poles had shifted,

449
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,039
I was cruising back
to the home country,

450
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,005
already dreaming about
how I was going to spend my money.

451
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,199
- Hello, Nate.
- Hi.

452
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,289
- Where's Christopher?
- Who?

453
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,769
- Christopher Clark.
- Oh, Toph?

454
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,559
He hooked up with one
of Canada's finest.

455
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,559
I'm gonna go home and
sleep at my mom's house.

456
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,330
Way to rub it in.

457
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,442
Could you pull into the secondary
inspection area, please?

458
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,760
Man. Fine.

459
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,479
Jesus.

460
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,479
And there's no drugs in the car?

461
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,490
- Take a look in the car.
- Please. Please do.

462
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,599
As the inbred beagle was hitting
on a moldy corndog in my car,

463
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,999
Topher had gotten
so turned around, he ended up

464
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,679
back on the same road
in Canada he'd started on.

465
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,119
- Fuck.
- Like I said,

466
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,599
he was from Boston.

467
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,882
I guess they don't get out
in the woods much there.

468
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,839
Open your mouth.

469
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,559
I was getting poked and prodded

470
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,119
for the second time that day.

471
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,319
I have to say, the
second cavity search

472
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,039
was a lot less painful.

473
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,279
- Drop your shorts.
- I just wish he had taken

474
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,244
the class ring off first. Yep.

475
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,805
Ground control, major Tom.
Do you read me?

476
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,601
Ground control, major Tom.
Do you...

477
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,368
Major Tom, where the fuck are you?

478
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,282
Nate? Nate?

479
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,399
Who are you calling?

480
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,999
Who the fuck is this?

481
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,531
The fuck's this?

482
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,571
Nate. Nate!

483
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,611
Major Tom, ground control.
Are you in?

484
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,446
Fuck.

485
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,160
Ground control. Where are you?
I'm at mile 8. Where are you?

486
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,006
Topher, I'm at mile 8.
Where are you?

487
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,847
- Ah, fuck.
- Jesus.

488
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,689
Shit. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

489
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,559
Holy shit.

490
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,206
- You okay?
- Yeah, man. It was a long run.

491
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,683
Holy shit. We did it!

492
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,683
- We fucking pulled it off.
- I can't believe it.

493
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,319
We sold that first pound in
about 5 nanoseconds.

494
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,719
Between Topher and me, we knew all
the head cases in Coeur D'alene.

495
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,641
We cleared two large selling
a pound of P.O.W. Dirt weed.

496
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,962
That was an eye-opener.

497
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,279
We knew we had the demand.
Now we had to get the supply.

498
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,399
If we had real weight
in high-grade rock star weed,

499
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,170
the sky was the limit.

500
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,450
So we went back up to Canada,
looking for a good connect.

501
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,599
Don't slow down. Just drive normal.

502
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,199
Why wouldn't I drive normal?
There's a cop.

503
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,767
Who cares? It's a cop.
Who gives a shit?

504
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:51,523
- He's doing his job.
- Don't drive too fast.

505
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,167
- Don't slow down.
- I'm not slowing down.

506
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,010
Why are they fucking...

507
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,481
Oh, shit.

508
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,120
Might as well
pull over here, where it's safe.

509
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,279
Drive forward more.

510
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,891
No stupid, fucking, juvenile jokes.

511
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,845
License, registration.

512
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:31,922
Hey. Can't actually find the registration,
I've had this thing so many years.

513
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,442
Were we doing anything
wrong, officer?

514
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,489
You're not wearing your seatbelt.

515
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,205
You fucker.

516
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,644
Sorry about that, officer.

517
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,531
Where you boys headed?

518
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,479
Creston.

519
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,251
Yeah, we're going to
visit a friend in Creston.

520
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,685
Where does your friend live?

521
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,039
Uh, high near the school...
Right near the high school, sir.

522
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,599
By the high school. Yellow house, I
can't remember the name of the street,

523
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,399
but I know how to
get there once I see the school.

524
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,719
There's a steeple
somewhere, I think.

525
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,809
You remember your friend's name?

526
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,406
Y... yep.

527
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,439
- What is it?
- Uh, Michel, but it's a dude.

528
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,719
- Yeah, Mee-Chel.
- Yeah, he's Russian.

529
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,399
French. Uh, both. Both.

530
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,887
Russian. Yes.

531
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,399
If you boys are looking
to score some weed,

532
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,284
you're in the wrong place.

533
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,531
You want to get on 36,
go north to Nelson.

534
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,919
That's where Canada
grows its finest green.

535
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,719
Uh, okay.

536
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,163
You boys have a really good day.

537
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,721
Wear your seatbelts. Thanks a lot.

538
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,647
Did he just tell us...

539
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,079
Go, go. Be cool.
Is he fucking with us?

540
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,601
This is awesome.
Canada's the coolest.

541
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,999
- Yes, $8.
- Go wild. All right.

542
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,326
All right.

543
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,131
Smells good.

544
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,925
Tastes good, too.

545
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,680
You want a bite?

546
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,006
Isn't there some shit about
smoking at a gas station?

547
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,009
My dad owns the gas station.

548
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,123
Huh. So he's

549
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,411
cool with his hottest daughter
just blowing herself up?

550
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,844
Do you want to write
a fucking report?

551
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,485
Do you want a hit?

552
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,924
I don't want to write a report.

553
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,559
I'm Topher.

554
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,841
Nicole.

555
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,959
Nate, come here, sexy.

556
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,639
Oh, this is my buddy, Darren.

557
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,959
What's up, dude? This is my boy Nate.
He's kind of shy around white girls.

558
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,079
Fuck you, I'm shy. Hi.
Nate. Pleasure.

559
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,760
Nicole. Don't be shy
around me, Nate.

560
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,639
I'm an easy girl to get to know.

561
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,969
Holy shit, this is
bomb-ass chronic.

562
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,884
You want to take
some home with you?

563
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,479
Uh... yeah.

564
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,799
Yeah. We, uh, how much?
How much we talking?

565
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,319
How much you looking for?

566
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,681
A lot.

567
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,199
We probably should have
suspected a set-up.

568
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,209
I would have claimed entrapment.

569
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,519
But you don't get
many second chances in life.

570
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,245
Or first chances, for that matter.

571
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,519
When an opportunity
like Nicole comes along,

572
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,008
you better be ready to
jump on and bite down hard.

573
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,847
Come on.

574
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,206
Hey, mom.

575
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,079
This is, uh, Topher and...

576
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,639
Nate. Hi. How are you?

577
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,759
- Good.
- How are you? Pleasure.

578
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,088
- Nate?
- How are you? Not bad.

579
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,999
That's my little sister Ella.

580
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,839
Hi, Ella. Hey there.

581
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,919
How are you?

582
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,559
These boys are looking
for some buds.

583
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,967
Sweet. Okay, hold on.

584
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,129
John! These boys come a-looking.

585
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,211
Around here.

586
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,241
Almost there, fellows. Let's go.

587
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,279
Little corner here.
Watch your heads. Low bridge.

588
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,239
Now we're stepping up.
Let's go. Step up.

589
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,279
Up, up. There you go.

590
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,323
All right, lose the masks.

591
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,366
Come on in.

592
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,769
Ever seen a vegging room before?

593
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,247
- No.
- Well, welcome then.

594
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,519
This is a completely controlled
and sealed environment.

595
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,719
Temperature, co2, humidity.
It's all controlled.

596
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,321
- Get the fuck away from it.
- We use rockwool

597
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,443
and these puffed lava
rocks. There you go.

598
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,407
Plants absolutely love it.

599
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,759
Let me show you the flowering room.

600
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,359
Whatever you do,
don't touch those yellow things.

601
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,319
- Why not?
- Whole place will blow up.

602
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,487
Really?

603
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,282
- No.
- They're fly traps.

604
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,611
I have been selecting
indica mothers

605
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,089
and cross-breeding them with
mostly indica male plants.

606
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,919
And this, oh, this is

607
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,724
my masterpiece.

608
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,321
Took me almost 20 years
to develop this strain.

609
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,439
The homozygous dominant
is what gets the great bud color.

610
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,479
This Durga Mata, she's a hybrid
of two different Shiva strains.

611
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,480
I get one from a U.S.
government laboratory.

612
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,079
Look at that thick stem, will you?

613
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,239
Short inner loaves,
long, pointy fingers.

614
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,965
Strong veins.

615
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,451
Tight, tight bud clusters.

616
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,769
I love the frosty look, don't you?

617
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,719
Fucking love it. Looks amazing.

618
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,639
Go ahead, take a big smell. Yeah?

619
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,727
Yeah.

620
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,799
Enormously high THC.

621
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,359
Very sweet, hashy taste.

622
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,291
And it finishes with
a Christmas cake mix

623
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,728
of tropical, fruity flavors.

624
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,850
Manatushka thunderfuck
and silver kush, see,

625
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,919
can't even carry this
bud's jockstrap.

626
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,679
It's two different universes.

627
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,159
They're not even in the
fucking same reality.

628
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,646
Look at me.

629
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,362
The shit that we grow
here is fucking insane.

630
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,606
This is the healthiest THC
delivery system that you can use.

631
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,999
You understand, it doesn't burn

632
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,439
the leaves, it just
heats them up enough

633
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,041
to release and activate the THC.

634
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,039
So, it feels like you're
inhaling cool air,

635
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,999
with a light kind of
candy corn taste.

636
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,487
Trust me, when you smoke
as much as we do,

637
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,723
it's the only way to go.

638
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,599
Yeah. I mean, your lungs
are the gateway to the bloodstream,

639
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,928
and they have to
last you a lifetime.

640
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,959
John used to be a two
pack a day smoker

641
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,879
- when we met.
- You are a goddess,

642
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,559
and you saved my life.

643
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,159
Of course, baby. You boys
don't smoke cigarettes, do you?

644
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,599
- He does.
- That's a nasty habit.

645
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,759
I mean, those things
are just full of chemicals.

646
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,479
We don't let Nicky
date smokers, do we?

647
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,489
Yeah, I actually just quit.

648
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,884
Hey. Hey, uh,

649
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,447
you mind if I get another slug?

650
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,764
Easy there, killer.

651
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,760
This isn't that Mexi schwag
you're used to smoking.

652
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,841
It will drop you like owl
shit on the forest floor.

653
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,399
- Dad, stop bragging.
- Nicole, baby,

654
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,409
it's not bragging
if it's the truth.

655
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,799
The THC content in here
is, what, 25 percent?

656
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,446
Your head's used to 7.

657
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,919
Coley bear, you want to
swirl down a little magic?

658
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,087
Yes.

659
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,368
Oh, thanks for asking me.

660
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,361
Oh, come on, mama bear,
you know you're always included.

661
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,770
- Your daddy's favorite girl.
- Oh, I better be daddy's only girl.

662
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,488
Someone's gonna get laid tonight.

663
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,321
Who?

664
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,087
This is pretty strange, huh, kid?

665
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,048
We don't deal in small quantity.

666
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,519
Nothing less than a hundred
a run, $1600 a pound.

667
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,119
Trust me, it's in both
of our best interests.

668
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,529
You're gonna want to keep your
risk-reward ratio nice and high.

669
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,119
Can you deal with
that kind of stock?

670
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:45,325
Remembering that effective
distribution is the key to success

671
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,319
for all of us in this business.

672
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,363
The only sure thing is the demand.

673
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,885
The rest of it is just plain,
old-fashioned hard work.

674
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,319
You're preaching again.

675
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,199
No. But, honey, this is important.
And let me tell them why.

676
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,971
Because when the money comes,

677
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,524
when it really, really
starts to come,

678
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,644
well, sometimes, boys, it is hard
to keep your go kart on the track.

679
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,762
Actually, we were
thinking more like 300 pounds.

680
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,000
Excuse me?

681
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,159
Can you get that many able bodies?

682
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,359
Serious soldiers with
soft, golden hearts?

683
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,159
- It's not a problem.
- People who you would blind trust

684
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,648
- in a forest fire or firefight.
- 100 percent.

685
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,809
These are guys I grew up with.

686
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,367
They're my brothers but from
different mothers.

687
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,491
Well, let's get down
to brass tacks.

688
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:45,364
Drug smuggling... yes.
That damn sure is what it ls...

689
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,883
Requires more cool, more integrity

690
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,839
than any other business. So much
is done on a wink and a handshake.

691
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,559
And if you did get busted, it's
usually because somebody was jealous.

692
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,922
They ratted you out.
Someone on the inside.

693
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,759
Someone on your first-string team,
all full of beer

694
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,719
and bullshit, who has no idea
what cool really means.

695
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,159
Clint Eastwood.
Clint Eastwood is cool.

696
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,279
12 to 20 words a picture,
no need to brag,

697
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,164
no need to boast.

698
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,210
And if you're not humble,

699
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,759
start flashing your hubris,
with your candy apple red...

700
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,959
Daddy, shut up. You're
way too stoned...

701
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,239
You're right. I fucking well am.

702
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,199
I think that we should
just keep it small at first.

703
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,129
We can handle it.

704
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,964
And I appreciate it.

705
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,039
Better to hear it now than to
have to experience it later.

706
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,571
We don't front product.

707
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,805
We're strictly cash and carry.

708
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,323
It keeps the air between
us clean and pure.

709
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,720
I understand.

710
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,930
300 pounds?

711
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,004
How fucking high are you?

712
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,519
Seriously, what type of Tony Montana,
bipolar shit are you on right now?

713
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,319
Because you almost had
a fucking heart attack

714
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,170
crossing the border carrying
nothing but your own weight.

715
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,399
Now you want to do
300 pounds a run?

716
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,359
Where the fuck are we gonna
get that kind of money?

717
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,399
- I'll get it.
- Oh, you'll get it.

718
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,199
Yeah. You got a fucking
oil well somewhere

719
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,559
in your backyard you
haven't told anybody about?

720
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,119
Look, dude, this is our big chance,
and it may be our only one,

721
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,084
so we have to take it. Okay?

722
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,639
300 pounds
will get you $640,000.

723
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:25,210
That's 3.8 million in a week, and that's
taking Sunday off for a little prayer, okay?

724
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,959
- Can you believe that shit?
- Fucking ridiculous. No, I don't believe...

725
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,479
Boys, why don't you stay over?

726
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,170
You're in no condition to drive.

727
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,488
Seriously, it's all good. Come on.

728
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,159
All right.

729
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,959
Thank God she came
out with the invite,

730
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,884
because right then, I couldn't have driven
a biscuit into a plate full of gravy.

731
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,999
I'm all for mixing
business with pleasure,

732
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,519
but I knew if this business
got done and done right,

733
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,122
there would be more pleasure than any
of us could handle without a spotter.

734
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,079
Thank God Topher was too dumb

735
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,679
to slop on the one
condom he brought,

736
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,566
because I needed it to get the
sample weed back across the border.

737
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,479
I never really tested
my gag reflex before,

738
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,759
but fuck me if the banana
taste in lubricant

739
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,566
didn't make me want to
puke like a sick puppy.

740
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,401
Fuck.

741
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,529
- Hello, Mr. Norman.
- Hi.

742
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,883
Right over to secondary inspection.

743
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,087
Great.

744
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,319
That was the only time I ever
drove product across the border.

745
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,919
I had an 8th of Durga Mata
in my lower intestine

746
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,600
'cause I knew I'd need it to
rustle up investors.

747
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,599
I just hoped it smelled and smoked
sweet after the journey it was taking,

748
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,929
and that they weren't gonna give me a
laxative and an hour on the shitter.

749
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,886
Drop them.

750
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,930
Hey, Barry. How you doing?
Nate Norman.

751
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,159
I have a business proposal for you.

752
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,931
Hey, Barry. My name is Nate Norman.

753
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,762
I have a business
proposition for you.

754
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,159
Barry Lerner. Not
his real name, FYI.

755
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,279
But someone I heard about through
this guy who used to run for Butler.

756
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,962
Remember when I said Butler should have
done less talking and more listening?

757
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,799
Feds have been trying
to nail Barry for years.

758
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,844
And if I had rolled on him,
I wouldn't be where I am today.

759
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,444
But he kept his word,
and I kept mine.

760
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,879
Can I get you another soda?

761
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,287
- Uh, sure.
- Anything else?

762
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,959
Uh, yeah. Could I have a beer sent
over to Barry Lerner over there?

763
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,519
Uh, what kind of beer?

764
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,159
- What do you got?
- We have a lot of different kinds of beers.

765
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,479
Just get what that guy's having
and send it over to him, please.

766
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,682
- All right, 6 bucks.
- Okay.

767
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:40,523
2, 3, 6, and as a bonus...

768
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,519
Here's some change. Baller.

769
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,926
Thank you.

770
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,689
Barry was from Israel.

771
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,999
Not the beaches with
the beautiful girls part,

772
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,839
but the Munich revenge part.

773
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,759
He'd been charged with
5 counts of murder

774
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,159
and aggravated assault, but never
got close to being convicted.

775
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,559
He brought ecstasy in
from the coast of Portugal,

776
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,639
cocaine from South Peru,
and funneled money

777
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,159
from the streets of
the northwest into his accounts.

778
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,599
But his real love and
passion was weed.

779
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,201
It's from that kid
with the glasses.

780
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,569
Hey. Uh, Barry?

781
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,006
How are you?

782
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,567
- Do I know you?
- Nate Norman.

783
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,406
Do I know you?

784
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,970
I know you do business
with Brendan Butler.

785
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,448
What the fuck is
with Brendan Butler?

786
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,399
It's cool, it's cool.

787
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,602
I'm not a cop or anything.

788
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,242
Know people who know people.

789
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,846
Look, why don't you go back to
your table and leave me alone?

790
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,322
"I am not a cop."

791
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,288
I have a business proposition for you,
if you're willing to hear me out.

792
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,283
I have cell phone stores.

793
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,959
Do you need a new phone?

794
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,889
Unhappy with your plan?

795
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:16,484
- No.
- Then we have no business to discuss.

796
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,281
Move on.

797
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,445
What do you want?

798
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,479
Where the fuck are you?

799
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,359
- I'm doing business.
- Just gonna leave me in bum-fuck Canada?

800
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,642
Seem like you're having
a good enough time, dude.

801
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,290
What kind of business
are you doing? Nate?

802
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,639
Dealing with a potential financier.
This could be big.

803
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,001
- Okay?
- Nate.

804
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,999
- I'm crystal.
- Hi.

805
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,439
Nate, what the fuck's
going on? Uh, Nate.

806
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,119
I know. I have something for you.
Come with me.

807
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,322
- Nate, who is that?
- I gotta go.

808
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,959
Sit down. Okay.

809
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,685
Barry bought a dance for you.

810
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,403
I knew what Barry was doing.

811
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,519
Do you have anything else?

812
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,319
He was using her to get all my info

813
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,439
and checking to see if
I was wearing a wire.

814
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,279
The guy was thorough, sharp,
and as detailed as a rocket launch.

815
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,239
- And I was glad he was.
- Stand up.

816
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,999
Okay. His ass was my ass
if this all turned to shit,

817
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,799
and let's be honest,
I didn't know what I was doing.

818
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,604
I was damn glad he did.

819
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,999
Taped it on her iPhone

820
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,679
she says she want
to put it on Viddy

821
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,839
but you gotta pay for
that look though really

822
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,999
get on your grind like
a good ho should be

823
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,999
there's enough tricks and
simps in the world today

824
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,839
for you to gather you
some big face fifties

825
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,159
make that pussy work for you

826
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,759
then bust it open for a trill nigga

827
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,319
just like you 'posed to

828
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,039
if you don't comply
shit pussy only pussy

829
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,844
I'ma call me another bitch over

830
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,080
Barry says if you
have anything to say to him,

831
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,250
you can tell me.

832
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,402
Just talk, Mr. big cock.

833
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,610
The clock is running.

834
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,771
Hi, Barry.

835
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,406
Here you are, sir.

836
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:26,088
This is better than anything
Brendan ever brought me.

837
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,719
I have a much better connect
than Brendan will ever have.

838
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,126
Oh, yeah?

839
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,479
Look, I'm honest and dependable,

840
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,809
and I will never run my mouth off
the way Brendan does.

841
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,759
The only reason I
even know about you

842
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,799
is because he's always full of
beer and bullshit.

843
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,799
Talking about crimping you

844
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,447
and running with your money or whatever
ghetto shit he's talking about.

845
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,481
Hmm.

846
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,967
That is $666,000.

847
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,124
For 300 pounds.

848
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,407
It's 2600 a pound. I'm paying 2200.

849
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,766
Okay.

850
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:25,320
Can I trust you, Nate?

851
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,846
Yeah.

852
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,570
You understand me?

853
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,363
You understand who I am?

854
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:37,648
Do you understand
what's going on today?

855
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,679
This goes beyond trust.

856
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:46,363
This is a second mortgage.

857
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,444
On your life.

858
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:53,804
If you were to burn me,

859
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,202
it would be a very bad day for you.

860
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:02,248
And for anyone and
everyone you know.

861
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,799
I know that you would
like your little brother

862
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,799
Phillip to raise his grades
in Mr. Harris's history class.

863
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,079
I know you would like
to see your mother

864
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,363
not have to refill
coffee for a living.

865
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,570
- Yeah.
- Do you understand

866
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:27,079
how easy it would be

867
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:31,444
to bury 170 pounds of rotting meat

868
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:36,289
where no one will ever find it?

869
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,919
I want you to remember
my words here.

870
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,559
I want you to keep it in your mind.

871
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,279
And I want you to let it guide

872
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,891
your actions.

873
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,966
I will.

874
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,486
Poppy.

875
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,963
I'll be right with you, son.

876
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,321
Go.

877
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,839
Yes, Vidal. We'll go to the beach.

878
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,168
We go to the beach now, okay?

879
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,926
You and poppy.

880
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,639
Now that I had the top-shelf
financing secured,

881
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,286
it was time to
assemble my "A" team.

882
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:30,440
But what I needed most was for
them to be mine, 100 percent.

883
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,247
One weak link and
my ship would sink.

884
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,202
Turned out I was gonna have to
whip donkeys into racehorses.

885
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,719
I've hand-picked you guys 'cause
you're all adaptable dudes

886
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,844
with no attitudes, just gratitude.
Am I right about that?

887
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,719
Mike hunt, you fed me
many times for free.

888
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,684
Now I'm gonna pay you back.

889
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,639
Terry, your dad being
a sheriff's deputy

890
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,519
is gonna put us at
a huge advantage.

891
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,479
You're gonna be our eyes and
ears inside law enforcement.

892
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,999
Dustin, you're the only jock in high
school who didn't beat the shit out of me.

893
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,399
I appreciate that. Even though
I know you've got a burnt knee,

894
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,444
you're still capable of kicking
ass and hauling grass.

895
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,079
Dylan, you've always
beat me in paintball.

896
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:14,080
I want you to have my back in case things
go down O.K. Corral style, you feel me?

897
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,879
Fucking Patrick. I mean, we've been friends
since we were, what? 5 years old?

898
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,679
Remember that time I got popped for
shoplifting and you took the heat?

899
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,961
Good man.

900
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,925
Scuzz.

901
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,730
You're just Scuzz.

902
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,520
So I have one question,
and one question only.

903
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,525
Can I trust you?

904
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,039
Because we hold each other's
futures in our hands.

905
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,199
United we stand, divided we fall.

906
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,359
And if we fall, it's because someone's
talking when they should be listening.

907
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,079
Someone who has no idea
what the concept of cool is.

908
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,839
Clint Eastwood is cool. 12 to
20 words a picture,

909
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,039
doesn't need to brag, doesn't need to
boast, just gets shit done.

910
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,719
How much are we getting paid? Runners get
paid 3500 a run and drivers get 1500 a run.

911
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:59,039
How much are you getting paid?
Enough to pay you 3500 a run.

912
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,079
I'm putting everything I have,
everyone I love out on a skinny limb.

913
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,329
So, if it works out, yeah,
I may take home some money.

914
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,799
You're gonna be part of
the "a" team, I need you

915
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,439
in the best shape of your life.

916
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,879
That means we train and we train
and then we train some more.

917
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,159
Pain is just weakness
leaving your body.

918
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:19,445
You want to stop and take a break?
Take a long one and don't come back.

919
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,808
We can't be in the forest.
We need to become the forest.

920
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,124
We need to be prepared for
any and every eventuality.

921
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,759
We're gonna rig Scuzz's
car with gas cans to explode

922
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,239
if we get pulled over by the cops.

923
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,079
Whoa! Oh, fuck off.

924
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,599
What the fuck? Why my car?

925
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,719
Because it's ready to blow anyway.

926
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,159
- And because I said so.
- Fucking chill. You sound like my dad.

927
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,839
He might be. I mean, the way your
mom sucks and fucks around town...

928
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,246
Fuck you.

929
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,999
We're using two cars,
one decoy and one load car.

930
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,559
Make sure all the cars are clean.
Insurance, even tire pressure.

931
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,919
And we never have the
crisp for the product

932
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,645
in the same car with the runners.

933
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,919
If we get tailed, the rear decoy

934
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,327
will attack and distract and
we will keep on rolling.

935
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,879
Remember the details.

936
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,519
Plan the run and run the plan.

937
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,399
Cell phones off.

938
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,161
If your phone's on, the feds
can trace you absolutely anywhere.

939
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,119
We maintain absolute silence.

940
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:21,688
If we trip off the motion sensors, they'll
be listening to us with hidden Mikes.

941
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,839
You close every gate you open,
you pack out what you pack in.

942
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,929
Don't even spit unless you have to.

943
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,639
Seriously, the last thing
we want to do is piss off

944
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,889
one of these survivalist
redneck types living in these woods.

945
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,524
It'll be 16.3 miles
across the trail.

946
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,159
Supplier will meet us at
the designated transfer spot

947
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,964
and we swap cash for stash.

948
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,486
Load up.

949
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,683
Hold the bag. Hold the fucking bag.

950
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,319
You'll be carrying 60 pounds each.

951
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,159
I know exactly how
much is going in,

952
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,319
I know exactly how
much is coming out.

953
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,439
So no loose pillows, no scraped
butts, no samples, nothing.

954
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,159
We got a job to do and
we're gonna do it.

955
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,639
They'll be watching from the air.

956
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,559
So when we head back,

957
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,639
we need to be ninjas.
Delta force strike team shit.

958
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,810
Seriously, invisible,
like baby's breath.

959
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,999
Once we make it across
the American side,

960
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,999
it's a flat-out sprint
to the finish line.

961
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,359
If we trip off any sensors,
they'll be looking for us.

962
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,079
We better be in our car
and on our way out

963
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,090
before they even wipe the doughnut
sugar off their mouths. Got me?

964
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,079
You got me or what?

965
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,520
Yeah.

966
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,724
Let's fucking do this.

967
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,405
All right, hold up.

968
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,729
- Hold up.
- What?

969
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,691
We're taking a break.

970
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,039
No. No no no. No sampling.

971
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,483
- Fuck you, Nate. Take it out of my paycheck.
- I will.

972
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,443
Now it's out of
your paycheck, motherfucker.

973
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,279
Those first few runs
went like clockwork.

974
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,439
We were cannabis camels,
team triple "B,"

975
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,799
humming along like
a perfectly oiled machine.

976
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,319
We could finally afford
unlimited wings and premium beer.

977
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,759
Guys, job well done, eh?

978
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,325
Yes. Yes.

979
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,126
Many more to come. Fuck, yeah.

980
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,165
And another thing.

981
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:42,759
I got something for you.

982
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,485
These wings are pretty...

983
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,279
Happy Birthday to me

984
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,562
this is only the beginning, guys.

985
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,926
Bam.

986
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,401
Jesus, guys, don't open it here.

987
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,484
Don't I get more than
the other driver?

988
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,126
Why?

989
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,399
Because I carried the product.
I took all the risk.

990
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,799
- We'll switch it up next time.
- Yeah, but I need it this time.

991
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,319
- Okay, yeah? And?
- Fuck you, Nate.

992
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,279
Guys, people are looking at us.

993
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,959
Don't fucking tell me to chill.

994
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,845
- Relax, Scuzz.
- Hey, are you Topher?

995
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,639
- What?
- I hear you're paying 3500

996
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,199
to haul great green across the border.
I'd love to get hooked up.

997
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,919
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who told you that, kid?

998
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,959
Who's talking to you, dick monkey?
Look, man, I'll do it for two G's,

999
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,519
and I promise I can run more pounds
than this fucking Teletubby.

1000
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,120
- Fucking beat it, kid.
- Get the fuck out of here right now, kid.

1001
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,319
- Fucking four-eyed fat fuck.
- What is going on?

1002
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,919
Your language. See how fucking long

1003
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,479
you can play before you get popped.

1004
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,364
Go back to daycare.

1005
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,439
- Okay, how you doing?
- What the fuck just happened?

1006
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,639
We do one job and all
of a sudden it's

1007
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,119
fucking all over the front pages?

1008
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,890
Who's talking?
What's going on here?

1009
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,239
- Not me, man.
- I didn't say shit, man.

1010
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,759
And why the fuck do they think
you're running the show, huh, Toph?

1011
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,719
- What's up with that?
- I don't know. Maybe because I look like a leader

1012
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,527
- and I had to carry your fucking ass the whole way.
- Outside, right now.

1013
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,291
Nate.

1014
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,445
- Topher, be really nice...
- Did that kid call him a Teletubby?

1015
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,519
What is wrong with you?

1016
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,759
Me? What is this?

1017
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,079
$3,500.

1018
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,639
30... are you fucking kidding me?

1019
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,879
Drug runners get paid, dude.
A what? I'm not a fucking runner.

1020
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,639
Dude, I thought we were partners.

1021
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,799
The whole buddy team.
Brothers from another mother.

1022
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,799
You wouldn't even have the fucking idea
if it wasn't for me. That's bullshit.

1023
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,079
It was my idea. I had
to talk you into it.

1024
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,559
You thought it was stupid.
I found the dream connect. Huh?

1025
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,399
The dream connect found you,
and then you fucked her.

1026
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,919
- Big deal.
- Jesus fuck.

1027
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,399
Hey man, I found the finances.

1028
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,599
I'm handling the administration and the
distribution. If anything goes wrong,

1029
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,679
going way off the
fucking page wrong,

1030
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,281
it's my ass signed and stapled to
the bottom line, okay?

1031
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,126
Look, I'll give you 7k.

1032
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,239
- Fuck your 7k.
- You said we were

1033
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,639
- splitting this shit 50-50.
- I never said that.

1034
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,919
You said we'd be millionaires.

1035
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,559
You will be. I mean,
at 7k a run,

1036
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,639
7 runs a week,
you'll be a millionaire

1037
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,639
in 16, 17 weeks.

1038
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,679
You said fucking
multi-millionaire, Nate.

1039
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,799
Then double that!
32 or 34, whatever.

1040
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,889
- Jesus Christ, man.
- Fucking unbelievable.

1041
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,844
Are you fucking kidding me?

1042
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,399
I need you to head up
the next few runs.

1043
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,279
And you've gotta
tighten it up, okay?

1044
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,879
You're the marine, I'm the...

1045
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,559
The head 'em up, move 'em out guy.

1046
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,519
I'm... I'm a desk jockey.
I'm the button-up...

1047
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,960
How much you getting paid?

1048
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,679
- I don't know.
- How much you fucking getting paid?

1049
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:35,639
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1050
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:38,281
I want 10 grand on the next
run, or I'm fucking done.

1051
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,439
Fine. I knew exactly how much money
I was making. Fucking earn it, though.

1052
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,599
More than enough to
give Topher's 10 grand a run

1053
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,399
and to make my mom's
wildest dreams come true.

1054
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,204
Best feeling in the world.

1055
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:52,006
Okay, maybe second best.

1056
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,719
How do you know these people?
Just some people from work.

1057
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,924
Is this one of your drug-dealer friends?
Shut up, Phillip. Phillip.

1058
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,719
Wow. Look at that view.

1059
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,319
It's pretty spectacular, huh?

1060
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,726
Oh, my God.

1061
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,600
Pretty sweet, huh?

1062
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,204
Would you look at that?

1063
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,361
Wow.

1064
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,719
And you say your friends live here.

1065
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,160
Yeah-huh.

1066
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,924
Oh, wow.

1067
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,245
What is this?

1068
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,884
Baby, whose house is this?

1069
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:44,959
It's our house, mom.

1070
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,207
What?

1071
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,799
Yeah. 7,800 square feet.

1072
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,286
Got our own dock.

1073
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,210
Built about 4 years ago.

1074
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,050
You got your own upstairs wing.

1075
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,721
Kitchen. Two bedrooms.
Two bathrooms.

1076
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,770
Anything you want.

1077
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,245
Oh, my God.

1078
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,723
How can you afford
this, sweetheart?

1079
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:09,519
Wait, wait, wait. You know what?
Stop... I don't wanna know.

1080
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,519
No, it's really... it's fine.

1081
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,199
These guys, these wall street guys,

1082
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:18,091
they hooked me up with this I.P.O.
And it just... it just blew up.

1083
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,279
And now things are skyrocketing.

1084
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,811
I'm cashing in.

1085
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,799
Oh, I love you.

1086
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,159
I love you too, mom. Welcome home.

1087
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,559
I don't think my mom really bought

1088
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,639
the I.P.O. Story. Any mom can

1089
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,039
look in your eye and see the lie.

1090
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,719
But it took my 11-year-old bro

1091
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,239
to point out what was really up.

1092
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,851
You're a drug dealer.

1093
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,771
Dealing drugs.

1094
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,851
That's what I heard.

1095
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,680
Who told you that?

1096
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,643
Mm, these guys from school.

1097
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,399
I don't do drugs.

1098
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,959
I hate drugs.

1099
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,446
- Really.
- Really.

1100
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,759
You don't do drugs, do you, kid?

1101
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,564
- No, I hate 'em.
- Good.

1102
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,439
Keep it that way, huh?

1103
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,919
But like everyone else,

1104
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,239
as long as they were
profiting in a fat way,

1105
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,119
no one wanted to know
where the bags of cash

1106
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,731
were really coming from.

1107
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,324
The next 6 months were
a green and bubbly blur.

1108
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,759
All we were doing was
running through the woods,

1109
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,088
and we were clearing
a million a week.

1110
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,119
And Topher was still
sampling the buds

1111
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,129
every time he went
over for a pickup.

1112
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,239
The Grefards were supplying

1113
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,599
the highest-quality product

1114
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,768
anyone had ever seen.

1115
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:33,161
We had an apartment in Spokane
that we used for the dropoffs.

1116
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,799
At first it was once a week.

1117
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,359
Then three times a week.

1118
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,971
Then every day of the week.

1119
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:51,688
And all of our lifestyles
were taking a serious upgrade.

1120
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,399
I finally got a legit eye exam.

1121
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,039
With the right prescription,
the world was starting to look

1122
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,571
a whole lot better.

1123
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,079
I'm not saying where.

1124
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,839
But I put a nice chunk
of my profit away

1125
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,159
for a rainy day.

1126
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,442
My own little 401K.

1127
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,399
Topher and I even joined a gym.

1128
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,759
Got myself a hot trainer and
was well on my way

1129
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,850
to losing 50 pounds of
pepperoni pizza baby fat.

1130
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,319
Everyone was happy.

1131
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,999
Prices were going down.

1132
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,645
And quality up.

1133
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,882
Everyone wanted a piece of the pie.

1134
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,886
We had the best-looking girls
in town in pairs.

1135
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:51,407
Girls that wouldn't've looked in our
direction now were sucking on the big bong.

1136
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,481
We were working hard and
playing even harder.

1137
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,799
And had forgotten old
man Grefard's advice

1138
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,319
about not flashing your hubris

1139
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,010
and candy apples, whatever.

1140
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,719
My head was so far up my ass,

1141
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,082
national geographic
couldn't've found it.

1142
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:28,168
But then one night,
we got a big wake-up call.

1143
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,330
What is it?

1144
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,959
Did you hear that? What's going on?

1145
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,605
Thought I heard something.

1146
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:24,959
Fucking hear anything...

1147
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,207
Shut the fuck up.

1148
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,686
Okay, do it.

1149
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,919
Scuzz! Put out the
fucking cigarette now!

1150
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:55,999
There's nobody here.

1151
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,804
Scuzz, put it out!

1152
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,843
All right. Come on, come on.

1153
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,359
What the fuck are you doing?

1154
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:43,721
Whoa.

1155
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,565
What the fuck are you doing?

1156
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,879
Same as you, bro.

1157
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,199
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

1158
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,084
Yeah, that's your first mistake.

1159
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,441
I got the franchise for this part
of the world, you understand?

1160
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,001
Give me the bag.

1161
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,479
Give me the fucking bag
before I bust a cap in your ass!

1162
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:02,682
Okay. Okay.

1163
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,159
Okay. I'm giving you the bag.

1164
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,885
Relax, bro, relax...

1165
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,203
Go go go! Go go go!

1166
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,441
Fuck!

1167
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,568
Fuckin' Asian ass-fuck Butler.

1168
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,719
I'd recognize that half-fag
voice anywhere.

1169
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,159
Thought our tickets were punched.

1170
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,771
I was scared spitless.

1171
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,799
If I was smart, I would've
gave him the weed

1172
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,879
and make you deal with
the fuckin' Asian fight club.

1173
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,403
You do that, Butler would've taken the
weed and killed everyone. Case closed.

1174
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,919
All these guys deserve triple
the money on the next run.

1175
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:36,039
Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah! Hazard pay!

1176
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:39,039
- We got fuckin' shot at.
- Guys, you knew the risks.

1177
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,519
Fuck man, we could've been killed.

1178
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,519
But you weren't, and it's over.

1179
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,759
So money's not gonna
change anything.

1180
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:45,959
Fuck yeah it will.

1181
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,799
It'll keep you in business, Nate.

1182
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,679
What do you guys want from me, huh?

1183
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:50,879
What do we want? What the f...

1184
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,159
We just got shot at.
Have you ever been shot at?

1185
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,359
- No.
- Have you ever been shot at?

1186
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,959
- No.
- We just got shot at.

1187
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,279
We just got fucking shot at.

1188
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,639
- Where were you?
- Well, I was on the phone...

1189
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,599
Well, I was... fuck you.
You were sitting

1190
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,439
on your computer eating fucking donuts
while we're doing all the fucking work.

1191
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:04,759
Fuck that!

1192
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,645
Jesus fucking Christ, you see
what we're fucking doing for you?

1193
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,959
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
Are you fucking high?

1194
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,639
- No, I'm not.
- You just sitting there, smoking bong loads

1195
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,319
while we're doing all
the fucking work?

1196
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,487
Come on, man.

1197
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,879
All right! Okay!

1198
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,321
Okay, all right. Okay.

1199
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,564
Jesus. Fuck.

1200
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:32,169
You'll get your triple
pay just this once, okay?

1201
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,289
I mean, I'm not gonna be making
anything, but that's okay.

1202
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,363
I want you guys to be happy.

1203
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,530
I want you guys to be safe.

1204
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,039
You're not just my employees.

1205
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,049
You're my best friends.

1206
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,050
I love you guys.

1207
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,569
So, yeah. This time I'll do it.

1208
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,531
Okay?

1209
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,279
We cool?

1210
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,051
Just find another route, please?

1211
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,600
Be safe?

1212
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,042
We're gonna be glocked and
cocked from now on.

1213
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,879
I did give them triple
pay for that run.

1214
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,719
And they all showed up
for my birthday bash.

1215
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:12,491
Taking full advantage
of my hospitality.

1216
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,559
Looking back, I probably should've

1217
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,279
reined things in earlier.

1218
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,879
But how do you keep
kids like this...

1219
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:40,159
Santa's broken toys
from broken homes

1220
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,639
and almost always broke...

1221
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,763
From celebrating their success?

1222
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,399
While we were celebrating
peace and prosperity,

1223
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:51,207
oxycontin-fueled jealousy
was lurking around the corner.

1224
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,162
Little fuckin'wannabe-me's!

1225
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,284
Think you can do what I do?

1226
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:05,450
I'll show you what I do.

1227
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,886
Dude, you're just gonna shoot some
random fucking geeks like that?

1228
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,367
Cool.

1229
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,119
- Hey, mom.
- How're you doing?

1230
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,926
- Good party?
- Yeah. Better in 30 seconds.

1231
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,119
It was pretty cool
being able to bring

1232
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,439
two fine and flexible girls
whose name I didn't know

1233
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,959
back to my bedroom. Oh, come on.

1234
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,128
I think mom got a kick out of it.

1235
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,119
A year ago, I couldn't
approach a girl

1236
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,719
if she was naked and
calling my name

1237
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:46,922
with a 40-ouncer in each hand.

1238
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,639
But I never fooled myself into
thinking I was getting babes

1239
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:52,931
because of my looks or my
thumb size and curved dick.

1240
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,759
I'd like to think they would've come
back for seconds even if I went back

1241
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,359
to delivering pizzas.

1242
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,519
I'd like to think that,
but I was stoned

1243
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,324
and delusional, to be honest.

1244
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:04,281
Hot chicks are starfuckers
in Coeur D'alene.

1245
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,250
And I was a star.

1246
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,679
Here come the fireworks!

1247
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:29,919
Huh?

1248
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,039
You wanna party without me?

1249
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,810
I own this place!

1250
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,282
Fuckin' swimmin'...

1251
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,279
I gotta check that out.
I gotta check that out.

1252
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,641
Okay.

1253
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,039
Maybe he wasn't
trying to hit anyone,

1254
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,359
but Brendan Butler
coming over to my house

1255
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:51,159
busting caps where my mom
and little bro live?

1256
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,203
You don't pull that kind of shit.

1257
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,439
Hey! Hey! What the fuck
are you doing here?

1258
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,959
What the fuck are you doing?

1259
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,400
Shit!

1260
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,725
You're fuckin dead, you
fucking cocksucker!

1261
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,199
My family's here!
My fucking family's here!

1262
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:14,643
Thank God everyone was
too wasted to shoot straight.

1263
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:15,799
You guys all right?

1264
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,684
Brendan Butler's a
fucking dead man.

1265
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,359
These are some guys I went to
school with in Cali.

1266
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,927
They're rock hard. Solid as fuck.

1267
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:30,119
Guys, this is Brendan.

1268
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,765
No names.

1269
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,611
Justin.

1270
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,161
Chicken head skinny motherfucker.

1271
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,691
These are them.

1272
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,571
Which one is it?

1273
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,006
Uh...

1274
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,359
The fat dude with the glasses.

1275
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:55,167
Nate Norman and Topher Clark.

1276
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,007
What's this?

1277
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,799
It's for expenses.

1278
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,639
- The bullets. 2, 3, whatever...
- No no no.

1279
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:12,571
This is supposed to be 50k each.

1280
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,639
Look, my brothers

1281
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,399
from Italian mothers,

1282
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,359
these guys have at least a million

1283
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,199
in cash and stash
hidden at their cribs.

1284
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,359
I don't think anyone's
gonna report it missing.

1285
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,848
And if you wanna rip and
rape the girlfriends,

1286
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:27,651
that's cool.

1287
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:34,724
If things go straight,

1288
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,279
I'll contract you
to provide security

1289
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,448
for my operation. Okay?

1290
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,323
75 G's a week.

1291
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,169
Have you guys ever
done this before?

1292
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,479
Fuck yeah.

1293
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,284
Yeah, man. What do you think?

1294
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:02,005
I think you're lying.

1295
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,005
But that's cool.

1296
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,479
I'll take enthusiasm
over experience

1297
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,079
any day of the week.

1298
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,799
You wanna rip it?

1299
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,321
- No man, we don't smoke that shit.
- No.

1300
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,239
I got way spooked by the shooting,

1301
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:24,079
and so my mom, my
little brother and I

1302
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,931
were holing up at
Barry Lerner's pad in the woods.

1303
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,759
I stupidly let Scuzz and
this chick Scuzz bucket

1304
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:34,963
crash at my place as long as they paid the
cable bill and boiled the sheets afterwards.

1305
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,079
- Don't fuckin' move!
- Face down, ass up!

1306
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,406
Do it!

1307
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:15,971
Don't look at us!

1308
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:17,919
Give me your fuckin' hands now.

1309
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,645
Give me your hands.

1310
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,679
Shut up. Give 'em to me.

1311
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:26,006
Shut up.

1312
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,719
Get him up. Come on.

1313
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:31,082
- Get up.
- Ow!

1314
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,680
What the fuck?

1315
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,450
Hey. Put some clothes on.

1316
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,444
Put some fucking clothes on!

1317
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:43,919
Not you, porn star.

1318
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,690
You don't need any clothes.

1319
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:48,925
- Get up.
- Ow! Ow!

1320
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,239
What, you can't lend a hand?

1321
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,919
- Really?
- He stinks like shit.

1322
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,088
- Fucking do it.
- Fuck!

1323
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:08,610
I don't think it's the dude.

1324
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,119
- What's your fucking name?
- Scuzz.

1325
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,559
- Where's the stash, Scuzz?
- I don't know...

1326
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,359
- Where's the money?
- I don't know. There's just

1327
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:15,679
what's in my wallet,
and there's a few

1328
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,399
- loose buds in the drawer.
- Which fuckin' drawer?

1329
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,039
- The one over there...
- Which one?

1330
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,439
The middle drawer on the left.
It's that one right there!

1331
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,246
Head down. Head down!

1332
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,479
Baby, what the fuck is happening?

1333
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,279
- I don't know.
- What's happening?

1334
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:30,159
I don't fucking know, okay?

1335
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,931
- Hurry up.
- There's nothing fucking in here.

1336
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,650
Where's the trash, Scuzz?

1337
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:35,961
Baby...

1338
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,799
Where is the cash, Scuzz?

1339
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,279
I don't fucking know, dude.
I don't know where...

1340
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,209
What the fuck you're talking about!

1341
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,439
- Ah! Fuck!
- Leave him alone!

1342
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,130
I don't know, dude!

1343
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,559
You're gonna show us
where the money is.

1344
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:50,919
I don't fucking know, man.

1345
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:53,159
I'm just crashing here
because Nate got spooked

1346
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,639
after Butler came in here shooting.

1347
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:55,999
This isn't even my house.

1348
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,839
Where is Nate?

1349
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,319
Nobody knows
where fucking Nate is, man.

1350
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,199
Everybody is rat-holed
up and quaking...

1351
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:05,051
- Ow fuck!
- Leave him alone!

1352
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,839
Ow! Fuck! Stop, stop!

1353
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,679
Do you want us to kill
your fucking girlfriend, huh?

1354
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:10,839
I don't want... hey, hey!

1355
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,839
You see me? I'm not
joking, motherfucker.

1356
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:16,559
- Ow! Fuck! I can tell...
- Stop! Stop!

1357
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,729
I can tell you where Nate's other pad is!
I can tell you where his other pad is!

1358
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,410
- Step, step.
- Okay.

1359
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,091
Which house is it?

1360
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,443
I'll recognize it if I see it.

1361
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,250
Look in the side window.

1362
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,079
If you fuck up and look at us,

1363
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,879
we will see pussy
girlfriend is dead

1364
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:06,082
in two fun-filled hours after you.

1365
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:07,879
Please, just let me go.

1366
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,923
Crystal, shut the fuck up.

1367
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,570
Don't look at me.

1368
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,730
I think it's that one up there.

1369
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:26,491
It should be one with
the pickup in the driveway.

1370
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,810
Past that one.

1371
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:32,251
Right here.

1372
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,159
This is Nate's house?

1373
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:39,439
Yeah, this is one of his pads.

1374
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,719
I mean, I was only here once.

1375
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,809
And I was fucked up
on Jaeger and Nyquil.

1376
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,964
Look at this fuckin' mess.

1377
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,490
Keep 'em fucking quiet.

1378
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,119
I really have to pee.

1379
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:33,159
It's a fucking rental.

1380
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:34,519
Don't pee in this fucking car.

1381
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:35,960
I swear to God.

1382
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,202
Daddy!

1383
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,765
Go! Go!

1384
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,879
Wrong fucking house, guys!

1385
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:30,919
I said that I wasn't sure

1386
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,479
which one it was, okay?

1387
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,119
Please, just stop! Stop it!

1388
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:35,199
Stupid fucking...

1389
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,319
Let us go, please!

1390
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:38,519
I oughta kill you right now!

1391
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,319
Wait, we...

1392
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,399
I don't know what
Mr. Scuzz and Ms. bucket

1393
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,279
said to get out of that car alive.

1394
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:45,879
Better not be fucking lying to me!

1395
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,081
Stop it!

1396
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,119
Please just let us go!

1397
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,039
Maybe the Mendiolas

1398
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,199
had a soft spot for weak,

1399
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,004
spineless turncoats.

1400
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:00,528
Maybe he turned around with talk of
Brendan's stash and cash. Who knows?

1401
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:02,079
Scuzz would turn in his mother

1402
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,408
for half a gram and a 50-buck of...

1403
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:11,008
What the fuck was that?

1404
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:13,847
Come on.

1405
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,841
- Please...
- Let's go, come on.

1406
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:21,559
You put your buck knife on his ass,

1407
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:23,444
peel it back like a grapefruit,

1408
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,370
he would've told you
where Nate lives.

1409
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,239
The guy had no idea where he lives.
And there's nothing in that house.

1410
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:29,839
No money, no drugs.

1411
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,486
The money was there. Bullshit.

1412
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,439
He just played all you posers

1413
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:37,007
like the squirrely,
soft amateurs you are.

1414
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:38,719
I should've known,

1415
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,079
comin' from the Cali salad bowl.

1416
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,039
We tore that place apart.

1417
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:44,079
Past the drywall,
down to the slab...

1418
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,886
You don't look for
the money, Gomer!

1419
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,399
You ask him where the money is.

1420
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,879
- One fucking time.
- Oh, you're telling us

1421
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,286
how to do it now?

1422
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,521
Yeah.

1423
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,163
I'm telling you how to do it.

1424
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,645
Yeah, you...

1425
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,846
You ask him where the
money is one time.

1426
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:07,168
And if he doesn't fucking talk,

1427
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,802
take his girlfriend
by the short hairs

1428
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:13,284
and knock her front teeth out,
and you gag her with cock.

1429
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,808
Tell her little
boyfriend he's next.

1430
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,961
He'll show you where the
money is real fast.

1431
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:25,159
Look, I want

1432
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,806
this done now.

1433
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:31,079
Jesus, I'll fucking get
the address myself.

1434
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,681
How about that? Huh?
I'll pin it to your blouse.

1435
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:37,679
I'll sharpen the knife, hire you a
counselor so you two can sleep at night

1436
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:40,963
after you cut Nate and
Topher's heads off.

1437
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,085
What about the bodies?

1438
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,885
What about the bodies?

1439
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,359
What do you want us to do with 'em?

1440
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,639
I don't know.

1441
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:50,968
Why don't you sell
them on fucking eBay!

1442
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,449
Fuck me!

1443
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:56,725
Do I have to tell you faggots
how to do everything?

1444
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:59,359
Fuck! Man, maybe I should

1445
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,085
teach you how to roll over, huh?

1446
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:04,011
Myrrh, roll over.

1447
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:08,806
See how easy that is?

1448
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,359
You would all be dead right now

1449
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,799
if I didn't talk my
way out of that car.

1450
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:22,879
I mean, fuck.

1451
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,919
I should be a lawyer.

1452
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:27,079
I mean, I could've broken
out of those handcuffs

1453
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:29,159
on my own. I could've taken

1454
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:30,959
either one of them on my own

1455
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,359
if I didn't have my hands tied

1456
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:33,639
behind my fucking back.

1457
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:35,159
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

1458
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:36,639
What'd you tell 'em, super-Scuzz?

1459
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,359
I tell them, "fuck all, man."

1460
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:39,919
So you didn't show them
where you thought I lived?

1461
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,719
Fuck you, Nate. The only reason
that you are still alive

1462
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,799
is because I took a beating,
and I didn't break.

1463
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,207
You would've pissed
your fucking dress.

1464
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:49,840
What was that?

1465
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:54,199
I said that you would
have pissed your fucking dress.

1466
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,399
Aah! Fuck!

1467
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,239
What the fuck!

1468
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,719
That was the dull end!
You want the sharp one?

1469
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,639
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1470
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:04,999
You think you're some sort
of fucking drug stud?

1471
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,079
My own house was broken
into last night!

1472
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,199
Fuck, that's right!
I showed them the house

1473
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,799
that you used to live in.

1474
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,759
This is chess, not checkers, right?

1475
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,559
But you thought I still
lived there, didn't you?

1476
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,679
Fuck you, Nate. I need
big money to be able

1477
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,079
to get out of town.

1478
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,079
Probably some plastic surgery.

1479
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,519
I need half a million at least.

1480
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:23,719
- Fucking dead.
- Fuck you!

1481
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,439
Fucking traitor!
Get the fuck away from me!

1482
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,679
Guys, chill the fuck out.
Put that down.

1483
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:29,359
What we need to do
is man the fuck up

1484
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,759
and get our shit together.

1485
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,883
- Fucking rat.
- Fuck you, Nate.

1486
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,879
The best defense is a good offense.

1487
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,919
We need... we need to
put our chips in a pile

1488
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:38,959
and hire some big,
scary motherfuckers...

1489
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,730
Some fuckin' rottweilers.

1490
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:42,928
- Push them back on their asses.
- Yeah.

1491
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,971
But this shit has to stop.
We're a fucking team.

1492
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:55,959
Listen, Gio.

1493
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:59,079
You get a one-time pass for
not knowing who I am.

1494
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,079
A one-time. Okay.

1495
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,679
What I mean... I am smart.

1496
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:04,848
I run shit in this
part of the world.

1497
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:07,639
Okay? So consider yourselves lucky.

1498
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,799
Huh? You don't know me.

1499
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,411
Okay? You're lucky you don't.

1500
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:12,119
'Cause I'm a bad fuckin' ass.

1501
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:13,765
Which fuckin' way?

1502
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,119
Which fuckin' way? Which
fuckin' way do you think?

1503
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,679
Fuckin' straight.

1504
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:20,279
What your fuckin'
father wanted you to be

1505
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,519
before you started
fuckin' this douchebag!

1506
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:26,279
You know, I don't gotta
tell people twice.

1507
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,319
Okay? Around here, you're
gonna learn this, boys.

1508
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:30,521
Huh?

1509
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,759
Okay? When I say, "go,"
people... people choke.

1510
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:36,530
They tremble, huh?

1511
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,519
And it gets done, capisce?

1512
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,529
We understand your frustration.

1513
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,411
Fuckin' frustration.

1514
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:45,159
Frustration...
I'm trying to win a game.

1515
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,601
You don't even know what
fuckin' sport we're playin'.

1516
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,850
Yo, here. See?

1517
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:02,199
This will be the perfect
place to, uh, dispose

1518
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:04,084
of a couple of punks, huh?

1519
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,599
When you slit their throats, you bring
the varmint to eat 'em quicker, okay?

1520
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,599
Huh? Or you just fuckin'
cut 'em up... I don't care.

1521
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:12,484
You think you can handle that?

1522
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,326
What the fuck?

1523
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:16,689
Think you can shut up now?

1524
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,401
Help me!

1525
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:34,769
You gonna shut up now?

1526
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,285
What about the dog?

1527
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,124
Leave the fuckin' dog.

1528
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,879
Brendan's disappearance brought
out the bottom-feeders,

1529
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,679
looking to take over his accounts.

1530
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:10,168
No one paid attention to
my "stop work and lay low" order.

1531
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:12,399
Hold up! Hold up!

1532
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,647
What?

1533
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,799
I have... I gotta take a shit, man.

1534
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:17,959
Come on, shit in your...,
man. We're not stoppin'.

1535
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,969
Fuck. Just let me take a shit.

1536
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,519
Look at this fucking guy.

1537
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:24,439
Where the fuck did
you find this guy?

1538
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:27,039
- Friend of Ronnie...
- Are you fucking kidding me?

1539
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,319
- Water?
- Yeah.

1540
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,442
Hurry up.

1541
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,839
Topher was making runs that
he didn't think I knew about,

1542
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,159
with a motley crew I wouldn't have
trusted as far as I could piss.

1543
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:39,679
But it took one
greedy cookie-eating,

1544
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:40,919
pee-stained bed wetter...

1545
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:42,119
Who I didn't even know...

1546
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:45,085
To put the final rusty
nail in our coffin.

1547
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,439
What the fuck are you doing?
Give me a second!

1548
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:52,483
Pinch that shit!

1549
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,279
Dude, wipe your
fucking ass! Let's go!

1550
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:02,606
Coming!

1551
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:22,761
Fuck.

1552
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,401
Fuck!

1553
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,046
Get away from it.

1554
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:44,131
3, 2, 1.

1555
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:45,799
The 21-year-old adopted son

1556
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,919
of a prominent Hayden lake family

1557
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,159
has been found.

1558
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:51,599
Uh, the police say
that the victim...

1559
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,962
Let's do it one more time.
3, 2, 1.

1560
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,879
Police say that the
victim is Brendan Butler.

1561
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,159
The 21-year-old adopted son

1562
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:00,799
of a prominent Hayden lake family

1563
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,679
had been missing for
more than a month.

1564
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:03,919
His body was discovered...

1565
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:05,719
This morning at 8:30 on this...

1566
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:07,319
This isolated logging trail.

1567
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:09,119
Police say that there were multiple

1568
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:10,959
stab wounds to his neck.

1569
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,719
Some of the sources that
we've been speaking with

1570
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,519
say that there may be
some drug connection.

1571
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:18,208
We'll have more in this developing
story coming up tonight at 10.

1572
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,163
That's good, right?

1573
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:28,001
Someone's taken out
the competition.

1574
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:29,719
It's better him than me.

1575
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:31,959
Well, who killed the
crazy gook then?

1576
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:32,959
He was jacked up on oxy,

1577
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:36,609
and he pulled the little dick and big
gun act on the wrong fucking guy.

1578
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,319
Did you do it?

1579
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:41,639
Excuse me?

1580
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,171
You heard me.

1581
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:45,119
Problem's been taken care of.

1582
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,845
That's not what I asked you.

1583
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:49,328
- You talk too much, man.
- I, what?

1584
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:52,519
Have a line.

1585
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:53,639
You powder too much.

1586
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:55,239
You snort too much of
that fucking shit.

1587
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,359
Can you even see what's
goin' on right now?

1588
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:00,119
- Mind your own business.
- I am minding my own fucking business...

1589
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:01,765
This is all of our business!

1590
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:06,206
I'm in charge.

1591
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:08,530
Did you pay to have him whacked?

1592
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:10,521
Huh?

1593
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:14,167
I run things for a reason.

1594
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,923
You don't need to know the details.

1595
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:20,203
Now, why don't you go sit down,

1596
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,364
watch some TV, huh?

1597
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:24,930
Go. Sit down.

1598
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,850
Anybody want some coke?

1599
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:35,279
Yeah. Yeah.

1600
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:36,766
Get over here.

1601
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:54,359
We popped you with 12
pounds of marijuana.

1602
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,483
Bagged for distribution.

1603
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,848
Do you know what a
criminal conspiracy is?

1604
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,559
- Yeah, I think...
- Yeah. It's when two or more people

1605
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,091
get together to commit a crime.

1606
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:10,289
Right there. Look at this.

1607
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,839
"Conspiracy to
distribute marijuana."

1608
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:14,239
There is a mandatory minimum,

1609
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:16,599
25 years in a federal penitentiary.

1610
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:18,679
25 years? That's fucked up.

1611
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:21,079
- I-I was just driving...
- Ripping off your doper buddies...

1612
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:21,919
- No!
- Yeah.

1613
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:25,169
We had people following you
parked on the side of the road.

1614
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,159
You weren't gone long
enough to get into Canada,

1615
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:30,079
so you went back there
to get what you'd stolen

1616
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:33,011
and hidden from your
buddies on the last run.

1617
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,241
Hmm?

1618
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:43,850
Are you gonna tell my mom?

1619
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,959
We've already confiscated
her minivan.

1620
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:48,527
I'm sure she'll find out
before the morning papers.

1621
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:53,159
- She's gonna kick my ass...
- She's not gonna kick your ass, Daniel.

1622
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:54,691
She's gonna be happy...

1623
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:56,599
Because you're gonna
help us find those guys

1624
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:58,928
that got you into
this mess in the first place.

1625
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:49,799
What the fuck?

1626
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:51,843
Time to get up, Nate.

1627
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:54,447
- How did you get...
- It doesn't matter.

1628
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:58,611
I have friends who look out for me.

1629
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:01,408
I'm looking out for you.

1630
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:04,799
And there's a really bad day
with your name on it,

1631
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,679
looking for a place to happen.

1632
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,928
Well, what should I do?

1633
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:10,642
Go.

1634
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:15,045
Spend some time with
my friends up north.

1635
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:20,971
- Now?
- I like you, Nate.

1636
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:22,999
You've always been
straight up with me,

1637
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,719
and in our business,

1638
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:27,331
that is rare.

1639
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:30,727
I am trying to help you live...

1640
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:33,165
Another day.

1641
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:42,411
Come on! Come on!
We're here. Go, go, go!

1642
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:44,759
Come on! Go, go, go, go.

1643
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:47,167
Fuck! Come on! Hurry up, go!

1644
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:49,399
Go, go! Get in.

1645
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:50,806
What the fuck...

1646
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:53,046
Come on, go!

1647
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,559
Go, go, go!

1648
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,719
Go! Cops! What the fuck? Go!

1649
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:01,119
Fuck! Shit! Where'd
they all come from?

1650
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:02,481
Fucking...

1651
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:04,679
Get out of the vehicle!

1652
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:06,723
Get down on the ground!
Show me your hands!

1653
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:09,239
We got a runner! We got a runner!

1654
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:11,439
Get out of the way.
Hands where I can see them!

1655
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,085
Hands where I can see them!

1656
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:22,241
Get down!

1657
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,166
Don't move.

1658
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:42,122
- Got him.
- Fuck you, cops!

1659
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:44,679
You smuggled over 18
tons of marijuana

1660
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:46,519
across an international border,

1661
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:49,769
at a value of over $68 million.

1662
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:51,799
You're facing life sentences

1663
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:54,480
with no possibility of parole.

1664
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:57,002
Take a good look at my tits, boys.

1665
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:58,679
'Cause if you don't cooperate,

1666
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:00,919
they're the last pair
you're ever going to see.

1667
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:02,959
I only have a few
"get out of jail early" cards.

1668
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,439
So first come, first served.

1669
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:06,119
I want to know who the
guy was at the top.

1670
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:07,479
Who pulled the strings.

1671
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:09,170
Who ran the show.

1672
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:15,966
Nate Norman.

1673
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,559
Yeah, it was fuckin' Nate.
Nate Norman.

1674
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,489
Nate gave all the orders.

1675
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:25,679
And we just went where he told us to go.
Nate never told us what was in the bags.

1676
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:27,039
We had no idea.

1677
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,239
Nate had all of the connections.

1678
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:30,679
Nate kept all the money.

1679
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:32,319
Nate supplied the financing.

1680
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,646
We didn't see shit.

1681
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:37,159
Nate told me if I left,
he'd kill my family.

1682
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:38,959
Nate had Brendan Butler killed.

1683
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,359
I'm pretty sure he did.

1684
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:41,599
That's what I heard.

1685
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:42,799
I'm pretty sure.

1686
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:44,399
Nate had Brendan Butler killed.

1687
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,319
That's a fact.

1688
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:47,090
He was bragging about it.

1689
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:50,925
Nate Norman.

1690
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,725
It was Nate's idea.

1691
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:58,210
He ran the show.

1692
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,290
Go, go, go!

1693
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:35,679
"Gone to Ecuador for a few months

1694
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:36,839
"to go hiking.

1695
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:38,719
"Have a bowl of BC bud on me.

1696
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:41,446
See ya soon, Nate."

1697
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,559
Let me see your hands!
Get your hands above your head!

1698
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:55,319
Right now! Hands over your head!

1699
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:56,679
Where's Nate? Nate Norman?

1700
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:58,211
I don't know!

1701
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:01,079
While I was hiding up in Canada,

1702
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:03,359
moving along the
underground railway,

1703
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,759
the feds were doing
every sleazy thing they could

1704
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,962
to try to get me back
in their jurisdiction.

1705
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,123
That's what the lawyer says, mom.

1706
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:17,599
You could do 10 years for money
laundering if I don't turn myself in.

1707
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,959
Stick it to Phillip if
they can't get to me.

1708
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:21,999
You just stay where you are, baby.

1709
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,999
They're just trying to
squeeze us to get to you.

1710
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,799
I just... I just
don't want you guys

1711
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,719
to get into any more
trouble because of me.

1712
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:31,279
Baby, they want to put you in jail

1713
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:33,528
for the rest of your
God-given life.

1714
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,319
They don't know what
a good boy you are.

1715
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:37,799
That... that you shoveled
Mrs. Roland's driveway

1716
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:39,319
every time the snow
plow blocked it in,

1717
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:42,000
and you never once asked
her for a wooden nickel.

1718
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,639
You stay where you are.

1719
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:45,966
Okay?

1720
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:49,530
Love you, mom.

1721
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:51,400
I'm sorry.

1722
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,884
Don't be sorry, honey.

1723
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,365
It's just pot.

1724
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,564
It's just pot.

1725
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,248
Welcome back, Mr. Norman.

1726
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:20,203
There's some people
waiting for you.

1727
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,399
I could have stayed up in Canada

1728
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:25,839
and had a semi-sweet life,

1729
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:28,805
but I couldn't risk mom doing
one day in the big house.

1730
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:33,159
I thought I would miss the cars,

1731
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:35,203
the houses, the girls,

1732
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:38,571
but I realized it was never
really about the money.

1733
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:41,008
It was about the
thrill of the chase.

1734
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:43,119
Good evening, Mr. Norman.

1735
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:44,970
Thank you for coming back.

1736
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:46,919
Leave the key in the ignition.

1737
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,724
You won't be needing those anymore.

1738
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:53,119
Hey, I'm not saying

1739
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:56,359
it wasn't nice swooping down and slipping
10 grand in your best friend's pocket,

1740
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:58,319
- for a hard day's work, hauling hemp.
- Jim.

1741
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:02,126
And guy, whose only other option
was a nametag and $4.25 an hour.

1742
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,639
But gratitude and loyalty

1743
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:05,159
are the first things
to run for cover

1744
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:06,519
when you're facing 10 years,

1745
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:08,927
busting rocks and dodging cocks.

1746
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:14,441
You know, for the record,

1747
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:17,081
I would've given up a
kidney for Topher.

1748
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,403
So when I got rolled
on and sold on,

1749
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:21,649
I really hurt right
down to the marrow.

1750
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,043
But he has to live
with what he did.

1751
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:25,925
Karma's a bitch.

1752
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:29,839
I got another dime to do

1753
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,719
at the "I fucked up
big time" frat house,

1754
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:33,239
but I've got a solid cell-late,

1755
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:35,599
who's got a great idea for
a money-making venture

1756
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,450
that's guaranteed to...

1757
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:40,639
I should probably just
keep my mouth shut.

1758
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:43,969
But you'll learn a lot in prison, if you
keep your head down and your ears open.

1759
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,439
I'm not saying it's the greatest
thing that's ever happened to me,

1760
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:48,039
but I'm making the best of it.

1761
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:49,519
That's all you can do.

1762
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:52,919
Play from where the man spots the ball.
Make the most of the opportunities

1763
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:54,610
life puts in front of you.

1764
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,530
And get a good lawyer.

1765
01:42:57,560 --> 01:42:59,285
Because mine sucked.
