<i>Jae Ho! Ra Il!</i>

3
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,920
Ra Il.

4
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,440
Ra Il! Ra Il!

5
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,260
Ra Il! Ra Il!

6
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,940
Ra Il!

7
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,360
Someone please!

8
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,560
Ra Il!

9
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,400
It's exhaustion. Your child experienced a considerable amount of mental shock.

10
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,320
Let's make sure he gets a lot of rest.

11
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,620
What happened?

12
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,160
Don't worry too much. They said it's exhaustion.

13
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:56,420
Can I be a good dad to Ra Il?

14
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:05,420
The feelings he has for that man...Do you think Ra Il can redirect them to me instead?

15
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,980
But if I keep trying to achieve that goal,

16
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,040
is there a chance that Ra Il could get hurt?

17
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,260
He's your son, Oppa.

18
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,120
For raising Ra Il like that,

19
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,660
thank you.

20
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,700
Now you do all of it, okay?

21
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,740
Let's go get something to eat.

22
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,060
No, Oppa. I'll stay here.

23
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,080
I know you haven't eaten yet. Let's go.

Ra Il.

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,260
Ra Il!

27
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,160
Ra Il!

28
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,980
Yes, welcome!

<i>- We will go in the private room.</i><br>- No, no, no!

30
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,140
Someone else has reserved that room so sit over here.

31
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,560
Sit over here.

32
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,420
Please give us two beef short rib soups.

33
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,560
Two <i>gal-bo</i>! (= Two <i>whores</i>! )<br> [similar to <i>gal-bi = short rib</i>]

39
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,820
Dad, are you awake?

40
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,580
Are you not sick anymore?

41
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,400
You, why are you here?

42
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,540
Why did you come here?

43
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,780
It's hard for you, Oppa, isn't it?

44
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,940
Yeah.

45
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,600
The problem is Ra Il and Jung Eun.

46
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,620
Right now, everyone is talking about the rumors coming out of those misleading articles written about you and Jung Eun.

47
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,800
Ra Il and Jung Eun are the ones being harmed the most.

48
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,940
People don't believe that Ra Il is your son.

49
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,760
That's why

50
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,820
I will make a public statement confirming that Ra Il is your son.

51
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,380
No, don't do that. We're not prepared for that yet.

52
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,820
Do you know what kinds of names people are calling Jung Eun?

53
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,640
You are a celebrity so you are used to these things but

54
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,220
it's going to be really hard for Ra Il and Jung Eun to cope with all of this.

55
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,840
I will meet the reporters and show them the DNA results.

56
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,260
Let's reveal that Ra Il is your son, Oppa.

57
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,620
You never know. It might get better.

58
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,160
Doing that won't resolve this situation.

59
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,120
It might even make things harder for Ra Il.

60
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,840
I suppose.

61
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:49,700
Ra Il's face, hand, hair, and body...

62
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,300
All of these may come from me, but

63
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,180
his heart doesn't belong to me.

64
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,380
I don't have the right to cause him any pain.

65
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,520
Especially considering I'm only his father by name.

66
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,980
Oppa.

67
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,380
Was it wrong for me to show up in Eun Dong's life again?

68
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,780
All I wanted was to be good to her.

69
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,300
My intention was to give her more happiness.

70
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,980
But instead, for both of these people,

71
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,280
I'm having thoughts about whether I'm giving them more pain.

72
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,980
No, Oppa. It's not like that.

73
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,360
But I really don't see a solution to this problem.

74
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,660
Also, Ra Il knows

75
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,640
that you are his dad, Oppa.

76
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,340
It seems like he found out somehow.

77
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,920
What?

78
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Are you okay?

79
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,990
Yes.

80
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,820
Ahjusshi...

81
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:55,130
Are you really my dad?

82
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,930
How did you find out?

83
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:10,180
But why didn't you come until now?

84
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,560
I'm sorry.

85
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,490
For me, that is

86
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,970
my biggest regret and apology to you.

87
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,280
Ahjusshi, please don't take my dad away from me.

88
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:36,330
I heard what the nurses were saying.

89
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,700
They said my dad tried to kill himself because of you.

90
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,600
I hate you, Ahjusshi.

91
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,880
Because of you,

92
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,200
my mom gets hated by people,

93
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:00,210
and I also get hated by my grandmother.

94
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,470
I'm sorry, Ra Il.

95
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:15,280
I was the happiest when you weren't here.

96
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,190
Same for my dad. Same for my dad.

97
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,450
Please

98
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,110
take good care of Ra Il.

99
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,250
I will let go of Eun Dong.

100
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,450
I will let Seo Jung Eun return to her rightful place.

101
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,960
I ask that you also

102
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,110
let the two of them go.

103
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,190
I will leave as well.

104
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:59,940
So that Eun Dong and Ra Il don't experience any more pain.

105
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,710
I don't see any other way we can resolve this entire situation.

106
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,940
Now we just need to leave it all up to fate.

107
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,380
Thank you for raising Ra Il well.

108
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,050
I will never forget that.

109

<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by The Unforgettable Love Team at Viki</i>

110
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,260
Here. Hyung asked me to give this to you, President.

111
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,570
He left it up to you, however you want to take care of it.

112
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,140
How did everything turn out like this?

113
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,940
Eun Ho Hyung said he was going to meet with Chief Jo today. He said he plans to make President Hwang testify as a witness.

114
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:03,080
- <i>Then there's a chance you may not have to go to prison.</i><br>- But instead, what would we have to do in return?

115
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,570
Knowing what type of person Jo Se Ryeong is, there's no way she would bestow such kindness without any conditions.

116
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,320
He said he's willing to turn this company over to her.

117
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,970
Well, I suppose with Eun Ho leaving, this company would no longer have any meaning for me.

118
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,430
But you know, I don't hate Eun Ho Hyung even one bit.

119
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,670
Why would you hate him? He's such a pitiful guy.

120
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,480
You've been through a lot.

121
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,040
Speaking of, it's you who's been going above and beyond.

122
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,230
It's okay if I spend a little time inside. Don't overdo yourself.

123
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,530
It's been a while. Should the three of us have a drink together?

124
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,370
Should we?

125
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,530
Here.

126
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,040
You guys have worked really hard.

127
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,890
What are you going to do?

128
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,650
Me?

129
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,060
Just...

130
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,240
Wondering whether I should go find a quiet spot to crawl into and live.

131
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,550
I can't be out and about too much since people know my face.

132
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,440
What are your plans, President?

133
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,050
I'll go back down to Chun Cheon.

134
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,490
What do you think about me running a motorcycle wholesale business?

135
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,940
Motorcycle.

136
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:09,640
Times were good back then, when I was racing around town fearlessly. Those were the days.

137
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,160
That little kid who finally put an end to my speed demon days,

138
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,460
who would've known she would become the center of my life?

139
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,710
Park Hyun Soo was really the coolest back in those days.

140
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,600
Hyun Bal.

141
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,870
You...

142
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,690
- Go into Chief Jo's company.<br>- I don't want to.

143
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,990
Even if I fall into the water and start drowning, I don't dog paddle.

144
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,600
- Go there, you bastard.<br>- I said I don't want to.

145
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,950
Ay, this punk.

146
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,200
You're pretentiousness is still a big problem.

147
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,260
You have to admit that I have some loyalty, right?

148
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,660
Loyalty, my ass.

149
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,060
Hurry up and pour it.

150
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,430
Fill it up.

151
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,350
-Dong Gyu.<br>-Yes, Hyung.

152
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,030
You

153
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,740
make sure to call me when you get married, okay?

154
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,420
Yes.

155
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,730
All this time,

156
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
you've really gone through a lot.

157
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,640
<i>And hey, after you get married, quit acting like such a smart ass.</i>

158
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,760
<i>I put up with your crap because I'm cool like that.</i>

159
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,520
Dad, I'll see you later.

160
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,130
Okay.

161
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:57,920
Ra Il, go outside for a little bit while Dad and I talk.

162
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,630
Okay.

163
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,920
Since you're awake now, I'm going to go.

164
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,860
Mother-in-law

165
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,590
told me to stay only until you woke up.

166
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,500
Mother-in-law will take care of your discharge from the hospital.

167
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,400
Let's talk when you get discharged.

168
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,890
Don't ever

169
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,580
do something like this again.

170
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,440
Don't ever

171
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,890
act like a coward again.

172
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm leaving.

173
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,210
I hope business goes well.

174
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,280
Are you going alone?

175
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,090
Yeah. I have to.

176
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,880
Take care. And I ask that you please take care of my employees.

177
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:31,270
I just want to ask you one thing.

178
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,140
If, let's say...

179
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,450
If Ji Eun Dong had never existed in this world,

180
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,030
would you have given your heart to me?

181
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,750
Why would Ji Eun Dong not exist in this world?

182
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,840
If I was born into this world,

183
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,240
it's only fate that Eun Dong would automatically follow.

184
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,980
If she never existed, then I probably wouldn't be here either.

185
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,730
- Aren't you nervous about leaving that woman behind?<br>- No.

186
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,760
I'm not worried.

187
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,420
Because we will definitely meet again.

188
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,990
That's how it is for us.

189
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,200
Take care of yourself.

190
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,520
<i>He's arrived! He's here!</i>

191
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,470
<i>Ji Eun Ho! Ji Eun Ho!</i>

192
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,770
<i> Just a moment. Just a word! Just one statement! Can you open your window?</i>

193
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,370
<i> Please give us some statements.</i>

194
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:52,200
All of you are working so hard. Let's go inside my house and talk.

195
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,760
Pardon?

196
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,830
This situation is entirely my fault.

197
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,280
That woman and that child are victims.

198
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,090
And the claim that she is your first love...?

199
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,600
Then what about that book?

200
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,220
All of that, I guess that was just me wasting time being foolish and kidding myself.

201
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,670
It's true, this was all of my own doing.

202
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:33,380
Is the child your son or Choi Jae Ho's son?

203
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,930
He is that man's son.

204
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,490
Please treat it as if I was just acting crazy on my own, and let's just put an end to this incident.

205
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,260
The child and the woman didn't do anything wrong.

206
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,870
Hello, Ms. Writer.

207
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,930
You came.

208
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,250
We had all of your pictures taken down, but there will probably be some people who still recognize you.

209
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,390
Please hang in there just a little longer. Soon everything will be forgotten.

210
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,060
Alright.

211
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,290
Eun Ho liquidated all of his assets.

212
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:30,640
But he insisted on buying a house for you to live in.

213
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:38,730
There are a lot of empty houses that have been put up for sale close to where you live right now.

214
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,200
What is Oppa doing right now?

215
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,080
The company is causing him an extraordinary amount of problems.

216
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,970
Remember last time I told you about President Hwang, that guy who left behind his entire mess for Eun Ho to deal with.

217
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,330
I swear, if we ever catch him...

218
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,080
<i>Hello?</i>

219
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,550
Oppa.

220
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,250
<i>Yeah.</i>

221
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,460
It's really nice here.

222
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:29,090
Really? That's such a relief.

223
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:34,330
You must be crazy busy because of everything going on with the company. Make sure to eat properly.

224
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,600
Of course.

225
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,290
<i>I will contact you as soon as I move in. I'll be able to see you then, right?</i>

226
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,620
Of course.

227
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:49,650
I feel so awful you're having such a hard time. Is there anything I can do for you?

228
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:55,300
No, there isn't. Don't worry, I took care of everything.

229
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,390
<i>That's a relief.</i>

230
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,590
Eun Dong.

231
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,140
<i>Yeah?</i>

232
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,310
You can't get sick, alright?

233
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:18,570
Why are you saying that? You sound like someone who's planning to leave all of a sudden.

234
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,820
<i> Oppa.</i>

235
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,820
Hmm?

236
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,910
<i> I will call you as soon as I'm done packing everything up.</i>

237
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:33,120
Oppa, call me as soon as you're done dealing with all of the company business. Got it?

238
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,980
Y--Yeah.

239
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:48,290
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by The Unforgettable Love Team at Viki</i>

240
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:05,620
Do you think I'll ever be able to buy this house back?

241
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:13,680
I bought this house for me and Eun Dong to live in together.

242
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,360
Who bought the vacation house?

243
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,060
Someone who runs a clothing business in Nam Dae Moon.

244
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,620
I gave him your message not to alter the house too much.

245
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,180
Told him there was a chance you might return and buy back the house.

246
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,810
Okay. You did well.

247
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,990
Did the article come out?

248
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,430
Yes.

249
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:53,860
Do you think that it will be enough for people to leave Eun Dong and Ra Il alone?

250
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,680
Yes. I think so.

251
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,840
Oh Hyung. Here.

252
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:08,480
This is for a language practice course. While you're over there, please take the opportunity to study English.

253
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,040
If you don't, you might encounter problems with your visa status.

254
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:21,040
You didn't tell Eun Dong that I was leaving, did you?

255
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,420
No. You told me not to.

256
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:32,620
If she finds out, I'm afraid she might insist on leaving with me.

257
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,780
Then, you can leave together.

258
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,040
What about Ra Il?

259
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:47,820
My father said that -- he said I am not a father yet.

260
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,340
That's why I am doing this. So I could become a real father.

261
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:59,460
Do you have any idea, man? This was a huge decision for me; it wasn't easy.

262
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,700
I know, Hyung.

263
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:15,740
The last thing on my list, there's a place I want to visit.

264
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,520
Hyung. It really has been a long time, hasn't it?

265
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,890
That's right.

266
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,210
<i>- Eun Dong! Have a good time. </i>

267

Yes, I will!

00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,590
Hey kid.

269
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,930
If you meet that Oppa,

270
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,630
tell him not to worry too much.

271
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,310
Tell him everything will work out fine.

272
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,550
Yes.

273
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,180

274
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,440
<i>Eun Dong, by the time you read this letter,</i>

275
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,120
<i>I will probably no longer be in Korea.</i>

276
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:24,760
<i>When I look at you and...When I look at Ra Il,</i>

277
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,560
<i>it will be hard for me to leave Korea,</i>

278
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,440
<i>and even harder for me to leave alone,</i>

279
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,740
so I'm just moving forward with this decision.

280
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,000
<i>My love Eun Dong,</i>

281

<i>and for coming back into my life, I'm so extremely grateful.</i>

<i>But right now,</i>

284
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,560
<i>we have no choice but to be separated like this.</i>

285
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,260
<i> For me, who waited for 10 years,</i>

286
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,580
<i>this short time will probably be nothing.</i>

287
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,220
<i>We will surely meet again</i>

288

<i>That's why I am not scared of any such things.</i>

292
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,140
<i>I will become a good dad for Ra Il.</i>

<i>Are you scared right now?</i>

<i> You were originally my woman from the start.</i>

<i>And then what? When she lives with another man?</i>

376
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,780
Take care of yourself.

377
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,700
Please let me see Ra Il every once in a while.

378
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,780
I'll explain things to him slowly over time.

379
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,300
Alright.

380
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,280
I'll do that. Let's do that.

381
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,140
Jung Eun.

382
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,040
I'm sorry. <i>I loved you.</i>

383
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:45,060
I thought that if I loved you, then you would have to love me as well.

384
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,380
But I became resentful because that didn't happen.

385
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:59,020
All of my wrongdoings where I had acted out of anger, I thought I was done paying the price for all of that.

386
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,660
But I think there's still a lot left to make up for.

387
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,600
I was foolish and mistaken.

388
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,700
It's all in the past now.

389
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,820
It will all be forgotten.

390
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,420
Please forgive me.

391
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,600
Okay.

392
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,900
You

393
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,740
helped raise Ra Il so flawlessly and spotlessly.

394
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:37,260
No, actually, you created half of Ra Il.

395
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:43,920
I'll make sure there is a place left for you as Ra Il's father.

396
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,020
I'll contact you as soon as the papers start getting processed.

397
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,940
Okay.

398
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,060
<i>Choi Jae Ho!</i>

<i>"Ji Eun Ho and Seo Jung Eun, Their Love is Genuine"<br>'Exclusive Interview With Choi Jae Ho, Former Baseball Player Who Attempted Suicide'</i>

400
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,930
<i>Ten years ago, I came to fall in love with a certain woman.</i>

401
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,190
That woman was carrying another man's child,

402
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:44,960
and she loved that man like crazy.

403
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,840
It was impossible for me to tolerate,

404
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,640
because that woman didn't love me.

405
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:57,120
So out of anger, I forced that woman into my car and started speeding down the street like a maniac.

406
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,070
That's how we got into the accident.

407
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:05,140
That's how I became disabled, and that woman lost her memory.

408
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,160
- And she lived as my wife for ten years.<br><i>-Hyun Soo Oppa...</i>

409
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,290
<i>Oppa</i>

410
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,940
That woman gave birth to that man's child

411
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:17,330
and with that, we became a family.

412
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,710
But ten years later, that man appeared.

413
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,730
To search for the woman he loved.

414
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,460
That woman is in fact Ji Eun Dong and that man is Ji Eun Ho.

415
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:40,670
The two of them had genuinely loved each other.

416
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,590
This is the truth.

417
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:06,380
<i>1 year later</i>

418
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,460

<i>- Throw it, let's see what you've got!</i><br>- Yah! <br>- Oh!

00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,120
- Very good!<br>- <i> Arigato! (thank you </i>in Japanese)

421
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,580
Okay great. This time then, I'm going to throw it up high.

422
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:21,590
- Yah! I got it!<br><i>- You got it?</i>

423
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,190
- Yah! Uh yoo! <br>- See, you can do it now that I've taught you.

424
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:29,080
- Open it! Open it all the way!<br><i>- I opened it!</i>

425
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,790
So, you were just listening patiently and holding it all in?

426
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:36,320
Violence is bad so I didn't hit him,

427
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,990
but just to make sure he doesn't say anything like that again, I gave him a piece of my mind.

428
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:44,180
You did well! I've got to say, my son is pretty cool.

429
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:47,420
Come on, who's son am I?

430
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:52,120
Ra Il, you know that you have another dad besides me, right?

431
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,020
Yup.

432
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:57,610
People don't all live the same way.

433
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:01,450
Each person has a different way that they love and different situations they face.

434
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:05,310
I know. I guess it would be nice having two dads.

435
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:08,700
I'm going to be cool from now on and just acknowledge it.

436
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:14,210
Ra Il, if you happen to meet with your other dad again, then call him Dad, okay?

437
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:16,060
You'll do that, right?

438
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:22,850
If I ever see him, I'll do that. Dad, if you tell me to do it, I will.

439
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,100
- Dad. <br>- Yeah?

440
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,220
Starting today, I'm going to sleep at your house.

441
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:34,030
Mom is all over the place lately because she's trying to write.

442
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:36,100
Really?

443
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:40,050
I'm Park Jung Eun! What is wrong with you?

444
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:43,010
Where would I have another synopsis?

445
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:46,900
I don't know, whatever then! Just forget it!

446
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:59,640
Ms. Writer.

447
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:03,620
There's a synopsis I've been working on for a while.

448
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,610
- What? <br>- Would you like to take a look?

449
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,080
- Mi Na!<br>- You've arrived!

450
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,530
- Grandpa!<br>- Aigoo ya.

451
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:15,480
- Hello.<br>- Aigoo look at you.

452
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,810
- Father, please take a seat. You too Mom, sit down. <br>- Let's go and sit.

453
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:24,910
Wow, you've prepared a lot of food! Oh, it's seaweed soup. Did you make it?

454
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:28,310
- Nope.<br> - Oh, Ajumma made it.

455
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:30,940
Nope. Ra Il's mom did.

456
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,690
Oh yeah?

457
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:36,410
You know how it's Oppa's birthday on Saturday. Ra Il's mom,

458
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:39,500
she also left this note.

459
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:48,200
<i>Father and Mother, <br>Thank you for giving birth to Hyun Soo Oppa.</i>

460
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:53,440
<i> I feel sorry and anxious about meeting with you, so I am just leaving behind this food I made for you.</i>

461
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,730
<i>Please be healthy.</i>

462
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:05,290
Hey, then you should have told her to stay. Why would you let her just leave like that? Sometimes, you are just really...

463
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,520
Oh! How can it be this delicious?

464
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:14,340
This is the first time I've tasted such delicious seaweed soup!

465
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:17,840
Wow, she really knows how to cook.

466
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:20,800
The seaweed soup tastes good.

467
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,280
- Eat a lot.<br>- Yes.

468
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,940
Mom, you completely forgot it was Oppa's birthday, didn't you?

469
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,460
No way! Why would I forget?

470
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:32,330
- It looks like you forgot...<br>- No, I didn't!

471
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,310
Do you have any actors or role models you admire?

472
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:39,110
I consider Kim Yoon Suk to be my role model.

473
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:44,580
Ah you're a Kim Yoon Suk fan? I'm a Kim Yoon Suk fan too! I'm happy to meet you.

474
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:48,030
They're here?

475
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,850
Kim Han Chul, Hong Chi Hwan, Kim Emma. What a snore-fest.

476
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:57,060
Start off by changing your names.

477
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:01,660
What in the world is <i>ki-man chuh-lee</i>? (= <i>dealing with deception</i>; mispronunciation of Kim Han Chul) One issue with betrayal and you're finished. Complete shutdown response.

478
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:05,390
And what are you going to shut down? Are you <i>Madame Aema</i>? (= a.k.a. Mrs. Emma, an erotic movie from 80s)

479
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:08,870
You know those names that hook you as soon as you hear them, like Ji Eun Ho. Ji Eun Ho.

480
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:10,920
Eun Ho!

481
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:16,940
- Eun Ho, that knucklehead, when is he coming?<br>- Jja-jan! I'm picking him up tomorrow.

482
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:21,970
Hello. Welcome.

483
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:31,030
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by The Unforgettable Love Team at Viki</i>

484
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:42,350
- Did you see Ji Eun Ho?<br>- Yeah!

485
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,320
He's <i>daebak (amazingly)</i> good-looking, isn't he? Omo, what do I do?

486
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,550
Did you see him? Ji Eun Ho, Ji Eun Ho!

487
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,900
Ji Eun Ho.

488
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,420
Are you on your way back to Korea?

489
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:16,180
When you go back to Korea, you're going to continue acting, right?

490
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:23,430
What are you doing? It's okay, he likes it!

491
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:43,230
Ah, I'm tired, tired! I feel horrible! How could I have been sitting in economy...

492
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,800
So embarassing. Hey!

493
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,380
Who's the actor and who's the manager?

494
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:52,600
Isn't it true that you had retired? Ahjussi, don't forget you're not an actor anymore.

495
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:56,240
Aigoo, a jerk like you...I could just...

496
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,440
It was my mistake, asking you to come meet me.

497
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,450
It's not like I got injured because I wanted to!

498
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:04,660
Who said anything?

499
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:07,960
You've been going on and on all this time!

500
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,700
It's because I'm utterly exhausted.

501
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:14,590
Hey, for 10 hours, I was sitting trapped like this as if I was stuck in a beehive!

502
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:17,060
I didn't sleep one wink!

503
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,580
Hyung, grab that pen for me over there?

504
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:23,430
Just constantly ordering me around for everything...

505
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,770
Oh, that feels so good!

506
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:33,170
Ayoo, ayoo, ugh. How does...

507
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:36,990
Who in the world drops a frozen piece of meat on his foot and gets injured like that?

508
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:39,550
I have never seen anyone like you, ever!

509
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:42,290
Some dummy who's never seen that happen is more ridiculous than the person who got injured.

510
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:45,430
- Ayoo, you can stop now already.<br>- What did you say, you punk?

511
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,190
Dummy?

512
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:49,360
Seriously?

513
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:55,100
This little asshole. I haven't seen you in a while and now what, you're coming up, are you? Coming up, eh?

514
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:59,200
How did you handle it over there, holding all that snarkiness in?

515
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,420
My goodness, now that I'm back, my mouth is starting to open up.

516
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,470
Hyung, admit it, you love being back in Korea, don't you?

517
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,230
Ayoo, ayoo, ayoo.

518
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:21,370
What am I doing with a guy like you...

519
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,770
Eun Ho. Eun Ho!!

520
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:27,260
Ayoo, this bastard! Ayoo!

521
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:31,510
Let me see... Didn't you get beaten by Kangaroo in Australia, did you?

522
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:34,820
- You look okay.<br>- Your joke is no fun.

523
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,960
Hey, bring a glass of ice coffee.

524
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,800
Ayoo.

525
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:44,490
Okay, okay. Now that you're sitting right here, it finally feels this office has found its groove.

526
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,670
Did you meet up?

527
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,390
No.

528
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,700
You have to get back to work.

529
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:03,610
I don't know. I just came in because of my visa.

530
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:06,390
I made an appointment for us to go see Writer Park Jung Eun.

531
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:12,620
Hey, I retired! Going back to work, doesn't that seem a bit weird?

532
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,520
I really don't have much desire.

533
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:20,300
And also, of all the writers out there, why Park Jung Eun?

534
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:25,120
Why does that woman focus on me so much? Am I the only actor who exists in Korea?

535
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,270
Ay, this is tiring.

536
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,730
Who asked you to appear in anything?

537
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,960
The plan is to produce.

538
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:47,090
My Love Eun Dong. Let's make a drama.

539
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:50,690
- What? <br>- Let's produce it.

540
00:52:57,930 --> 00:52:59,740
Hyung, it smells good, doesn't it?

541
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:04,880
Ay, why is the entryway so narrow?<br>- Bathroom, bedroom...

542
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,450
Hyung. Window.

543
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:15,460
Ayoo, this is it?

544
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,890
What is this?

545
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:23,210
Hey, how do you expect me to live in a place the size of a booger?

546
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:25,170
It's nothing but bright to me.

547
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:29,970
Hey, did I or did I not ask you to manage my money well?

548
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:33,710
What have you guys done with account I gave you? How...What did you spend the money on?

549
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,940
Did I give you that money to spend it on a house this small?

550
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,770
Hyung, you left us a booger-sized amount behind.

551
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:40,650
That booger wasn't this booger!

552
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:45,520
Hyung, really! You know exactly where President spent that money.

553
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:49,880
- Oh is that so?<br>- Okay, I understand. I will

554
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:53,290
- I'll ask them to transfer you to a bigger space.<br>- Hey!

555
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:58,130
Just because you start talking to me in baby talk, oooh jjoo jjo, you think I'll stop feeling bad all of a sudden?

556
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,140
This is a problem with your guys' level of sincerity. Sincerity!

557
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:02,800
Hyung, really, this was the best I could do!

558
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,390
The size is not what's important, it's your guys' basic <i>attitude</i>!

559
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:08,280
The problem is the <i>attitude</i>!

560
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,580
The start has got to be good for the ending to be good, you punk!

561
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:15,000
Oooh, <i>attitude...</i>

562
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:31,460
<i>Pretty Writer</i>

563
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:00,190
<i>Pretty Writer</i>

564
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,540
<i>Eun Dong</i>

565
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:34,510
Because of Dong Gyu's foot injury, I have to give you rides for a while.

566
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:40,930
- Where are we going right now?<br>- What do you mean, where? We're going to meet a writer.

567
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:45,460
Writer? Who? Park Jung Eun?

568
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:49,630
Park Jung Eun told me at a production site once about

569
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:55,290
a superstition saying if you rent out a pension for about a week and go there just to write, then bam, success!

570
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,520
She's in Chuncheon. Let's go meet her.

571
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:02,680
I think she has a lot of things she wants to hear from you since you're the original author.

572
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:09,060
Wow, the first person I go to visit after I return to Korea is Writer Park Jung Eun.

573
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:12,590
Hey, it's been a long time since I've gone to Chuncheon,

574
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:15,120
and it's funny that I'm going with you of all people.

575
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:17,790
You don't think it's the same for me?

576
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:22,290
Anyway, wow, it really has been a long time since the last time I went to Chuncheon.

577
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:25,340
The weather is great.

578
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:04,020
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by The Unforgettable Love Team at Viki</i>

579
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:54,340
I had no idea you were coming.

580
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:58,490
This time, I found you Oppa, okay?

581
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:02,570
You found me well.

582
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,450
How'd you do it?

583
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:12,970
I planned it with President, to meet you like this Oppa.

584
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:17,930
Not bad. It was dramatic.

585
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:32,950
Your company agreed to produce this drama.

586
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,110
- I heard.<br>- Also, Park

587
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:42,470
Jung Eun writer agreed to give me credit as co-writer.

588
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:46,400
Really? That's great.

589
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,550
Our Eun Dong has finally accomplished her dreams.

590
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:53,540
But

591
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:57,720
the main character is a woman.

592
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:04,090
It's a story about how this female character loved one man for 20 years.

593
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:11,890
The man doesn't know. He only knows about how he loved her.

594
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:20,160
That woman

595
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:24,870
loved that man much more, and before he did.

596
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:31,760
You see, at a young age of 13, she knew he was her first love.

597
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,990
Now I know.

598
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:49,990
So we can't cast you, Oppa.

599
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:55,900
- Why? <br>- I heard that you refuse if the main character is a woman.

600
00:59:56,290 --> 01:00:00,080
- Who said that? <br>- The writer.

601
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:03,590
Since the topic's come up, let's talk about it.

602
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:08,110
No matter what, of course the male main character loved the female main character. How could the woman love him more?

603
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:11,920
Absolutely not! The woman loved him so much more.

604
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,510
You want to debate it, who loved who more?

605
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:18,390
- Okay, sounds good. I'm confident.<br>- Then from now on

606
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:22,610
let's talk about who liked and loved more.

607
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,530
Anytime. I'm going to win that debate.

608
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:29,050
Okay, promise?

609
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:32,100
Stamp!

610
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,160
<i>- Promise.<br> - Okay, promise.</i>

611
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:49,150
<i>- I'll make a promise too. <br>- What's that?</i>

612
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:55,440
<i>What is it? Hey what is it?</i>

613
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,070
<i>Oppa, have you eaten?</i>

614
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:06,720
Make me home-cooked rice. I want to eat home cooking.

615
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:09,890
Okay, let's go.

616
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,790
