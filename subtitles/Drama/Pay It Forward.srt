1
00:01:34,577 --> 00:01:37,304
10-86, possible 4- 17. Baker, Henry.

2
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:40,409
3000 block ofBagley, 4- 17, 10-30.

3
00:01:42,077 --> 00:01:43,043
Get back!

4
00:01:43,244 --> 00:01:44,710
-I'll shoot her!
-Oh, my God!

5
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:46,501
3-L-90. I repeat:

6
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:50,165
3-L-90, request you notify hostage
negotiation team.

7
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:52,775
Have them respond to my Iocation.

8
00:01:58,277 --> 00:02:00,675
-See anything?
-Get those cars out of here!

9
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:05,804
Suspect is a maIe Caucasian,
approximateIy--

10
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,067
I'm a reporter.
How Iong have you been here?

11
00:02:08,944 --> 00:02:11,376
Domestic or drugs?
Is that his girIfriend?

12
00:02:11,577 --> 00:02:13,270
-Get out of here.
-Who is it?

13
00:02:13,477 --> 00:02:15,033
-TaIk to me.
-Get him out of here.

14
00:02:15,644 --> 00:02:17,303
-Go on!
-I got my passes.

15
00:02:17,977 --> 00:02:19,806
-Shit.
-I have every right to be here.

16
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,476
Where'd he go?

17
00:02:21,977 --> 00:02:25,137
Suspect has withdrawn into
the interior of the room.

18
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:27,707
We no Ionger have visuaI contact.

19
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,935
That was my car.

20
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,640
HoIy--

21
00:03:25,643 --> 00:03:27,700
Having a llttIe car troubIe?

22
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,072
That's a keen observation.

23
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,200
I can heIp you.

24
00:03:37,543 --> 00:03:38,600
It's the Jag.

25
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:42,369
You want me to drive home in your car?

26
00:03:42,576 --> 00:03:44,303
I want you to take my car.

27
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:48,432
I've had a Iot of Iuck IateIy.
I don't need it.

28
00:03:49,076 --> 00:03:51,735
You're giving me a new Jaguar
and you don't want anything?

29
00:03:51,943 --> 00:03:54,569
I can prove it. Give me your card.

30
00:04:05,343 --> 00:04:06,638
I'll be in touch.

31
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:09,706
What, you want me to kllI your
wife or something?

32
00:04:09,943 --> 00:04:10,931
No.

33
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:12,972
Tempting, but, no.

34
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:15,971
Call it generosity between
two strangers.

35
00:04:17,475 --> 00:04:20,237
Generosity? It's a Jaguar.

36
00:04:20,442 --> 00:04:23,000
You expect me to drive home
in a new Jaguar?

37
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:25,504
-That's right.
-You're a freak!

38
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:27,005
You are a freak.

39
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:30,766
You want me to get in this car? No way!
It'll probabIy bIow up.

40
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:34,305
That's reaI funny, bits and pieces of me
raining down in the street!

41
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:38,540
You think I'm going near that thing,
you're nuts!

42
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:40,570
Besides, I got a car.

43
00:04:43,109 --> 00:04:44,631
Sort of.

44
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:40,772
What? You llke it?

45
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:42,299
CooI bIade, huh?

46
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,498
-You want to see it?
-IKeep it in your pants.

47
00:05:47,075 --> 00:05:48,336
Fag.

48
00:05:49,008 --> 00:05:52,031
-He's gonna kllI you.
-I've got pepper spray.

49
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:42,229
ApparentIy, none of you have ever
seen a new teacher before.

50
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:45,434
I'm Mr. Simonet.

51
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:48,003
WeIcome to the seventh grade.

52
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:52,697
MiddIe schooI, that hellish, shaky
bridge you all must cross...

53
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:57,874
...before you become members of that
undyingIy enviabIe high schooI ellte.

54
00:06:58,308 --> 00:07:01,274
You may think you can't cross
this bridge fast enough.

55
00:07:01,474 --> 00:07:06,406
You'd rather cIose your eyes and not
think about it untll it's all over.

56
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:09,137
Well, I'm here to tell you...

57
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:12,136
...that is not an option
in this cIass.

58
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:15,201
Lateness.

59
00:07:17,774 --> 00:07:19,035
Tardiness.

60
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:22,866
To be Iate for your first cIass
on your first day of schooI.

61
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:24,972
What does that indicate?

62
00:07:25,974 --> 00:07:27,963
I'm having a bad hair day?

63
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:32,230
Perhaps what it indicates is
a Iack of respect.

64
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:35,770
You see, I'm going to be here
every day for you.

65
00:07:35,974 --> 00:07:40,202
And so I expect you to be here for me.

66
00:07:40,707 --> 00:07:43,434
On time, no excuses.

67
00:07:44,274 --> 00:07:45,103
Put that down.

68
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:46,870
Wait.

69
00:07:49,407 --> 00:07:50,532
Now...

70
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:54,437
...this cIass is sociaI studies.

71
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,502
That is you and the worId. Yes.

72
00:07:58,707 --> 00:08:02,799
There is a worId out there and even if
you don't want to meet it...

73
00:08:03,007 --> 00:08:06,461
...it's stllI going to hit you
right in the face.

74
00:08:07,107 --> 00:08:08,333
Belleve me.

75
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:13,962
Best start thinking about the worId
now and what it means to you.

76
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:19,033
What does the worId mean to you?

77
00:08:20,907 --> 00:08:22,770
Come on! A llttIe cIass
participation.

78
00:08:22,974 --> 00:08:25,098
Is it just this cIass you
want to get out of?

79
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:27,068
Your house, your street?

80
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,865
Any further any of you want to go
than that? Yes?

81
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,038
The mall. That's onIy two mlles
away from me.

82
00:08:36,173 --> 00:08:38,230
Let me ask you another question.

83
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:42,801
How often do you think about things
that happen outside of this town?

84
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,438
Do you watch the news? Yes? No?

85
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,629
All right, so we're not gIobaI thinkers
yet, but why aren't we?

86
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,438
Because we're 1 1 .

87
00:08:55,106 --> 00:08:56,629
Good point. What's your name?

88
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,169
Trevor.

89
00:08:58,373 --> 00:09:01,430
Maybe Trevor's right. Why shouId
we think about the worId?

90
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,094
After all, what does the worId
expect of us?

91
00:09:05,473 --> 00:09:06,699
Expect?

92
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,803
Of you.

93
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:11,827
What does the worId expect of you?

94
00:09:13,373 --> 00:09:14,464
Nothing.

95
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,370
Nothing.

96
00:09:18,173 --> 00:09:20,604
My God, boys and girIs, he's right.

97
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,066
Nothing.

98
00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:24,970
Here you are. You can't drive.
You can't vote.

99
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:28,468
You can't go to the bathroom
without a pass. You're stuck...

100
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:31,467
...right here in the seventh grade.

101
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,270
But not forever...

102
00:09:36,906 --> 00:09:39,633
...because one day you'll be free.

103
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:46,665
But what if on that day you're free...

104
00:09:47,073 --> 00:09:49,561
...you haven't prepared,
you're not ready...

105
00:09:49,773 --> 00:09:54,296
...and yet you Iook around you
and you don't llke what the worId is.

106
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:56,404
What if the worId...

107
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:59,933
...is just a big disappointment?

108
00:10:00,673 --> 00:10:02,138
We're screwed.

109
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:03,929
UnIess....

110
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:09,228
UnIess you take the things that you
don't llke about this worId...

111
00:10:09,472 --> 00:10:12,597
...and you fllp them upside down right
on their ass.

112
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:15,135
Don't tell your parents I
used that word.

113
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:17,698
And you can start that...

114
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,535
...today.

115
00:10:20,905 --> 00:10:23,804
This is your assignment.

116
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,130
Extra credit.

117
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:28,669
It goes on all year Iong.

118
00:10:31,072 --> 00:10:33,368
Wait a minute.
What's wrong with this?

119
00:10:33,572 --> 00:10:35,299
What's the matter? Yes?

120
00:10:35,805 --> 00:10:37,328
It's, llke, so....

121
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,964
There must be a word to finish
that sentence.

122
00:10:41,205 --> 00:10:42,501
-Someone heIp her.
-Weird.

123
00:10:42,705 --> 00:10:43,932
Weird. Crazy.

124
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:44,968
Hard.

125
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:46,933
-Bummer.
-Bummer.

126
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:48,798
Hard.

127
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,966
How about possibIe?

128
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:57,865
It's possibIe.

129
00:10:59,805 --> 00:11:02,566
The reaIm of possibllity...

130
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:07,365
...exists where? In each of you.

131
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:11,032
Here.

132
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,360
So you can do it.

133
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,267
You can surprise us. It's up to you.

134
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:22,961
Or you can just sit back
and Iet it atrophy.

135
00:11:24,805 --> 00:11:26,135
Atrophy.

136
00:11:27,205 --> 00:11:31,398
If there is a word you hear that you
don't understand, there's a dictionary.

137
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:32,968
Look it up.

138
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:37,135
And there are these dictionaries which
you wllI carry at all times...

139
00:11:37,371 --> 00:11:40,963
...because in this cIass, we're going
to Iearn to Iove words...

140
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:44,227
...and their meanings.
Any questions?

141
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:45,864
Yeah.

142
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:49,929
So, you'll llke, fIunk us if we
don't change the worId?

143
00:11:50,605 --> 00:11:52,468
No, I wouIdn't do that.

144
00:11:53,371 --> 00:11:56,394
But you might just squeak by
with a ''C''.

145
00:12:00,505 --> 00:12:02,437
What'd you ever do to change
the worId?

146
00:12:07,104 --> 00:12:09,366
Well, Trevor, I get a good
night's sIeep.

147
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,366
I eat a hearty breakfast.

148
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,628
I show up on time...

149
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:18,802
...and then I pass the buck to you.

150
00:12:22,305 --> 00:12:26,101
Now, I want you all to write your names
in these books and--

151
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:27,532
What's your name?

152
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:30,030
Molly, all right. I want Molly to
Iook up the word atrophy...

153
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:34,703
...and tell the cIass what it means.

154
00:15:44,202 --> 00:15:47,259
No, we're not in Mllwaukee.

155
00:15:48,635 --> 00:15:50,602
Straight to hell. Straight to hell.

156
00:15:50,802 --> 00:15:53,132
Four tequllas.
Who's having the fourth one?

157
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,460
-You are.
-Not for me, thank you.

158
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:59,294
-We bought it for you.
-Thank you so much. No thanks.

159
00:15:59,503 --> 00:16:01,298
-Why not?
-I promised my kid.

160
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,801
I know, it's horribIe.
You guys have fun.

161
00:16:05,002 --> 00:16:06,524
Wait, wait, wait. Here.

162
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:07,757
Thank you.

163
00:16:07,969 --> 00:16:10,265
What are you doing, Junior?

164
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,335
What are your doing, Jun?
What are you doing?

165
00:16:13,535 --> 00:16:15,195
You got her now. You got her now.

166
00:16:15,435 --> 00:16:17,594
You got him now. You got him now.

167
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:21,026
What time do you get off?

168
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:23,030
If onIy I weren't married.

169
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:27,260
He's married!

170
00:16:27,735 --> 00:16:30,201
I'm singIe! I'm singIe!

171
00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:50,500
-Hello?
-Hey.

172
00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:54,394
How'd it go?

173
00:16:54,602 --> 00:16:56,261
Are you there?
-Yeah.

174
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:57,934
How'd it go?

175
00:16:58,201 --> 00:16:59,167
What?

176
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,526
How'd it go?
How was your first day?

177
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:02,792
Okay.

178
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:06,263
Trev, you got to speak up.
I can't hear you.

179
00:17:06,702 --> 00:17:11,430
Sorry I wasn't home. I had
a chance to pick up another shift.

180
00:17:12,702 --> 00:17:14,099
You mad at me?

181
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:18,958
Trev, what are you doing?

182
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:20,698
Nothing.

183
00:17:21,701 --> 00:17:22,928
You find the spaghetti?

184
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:27,266
I'm eating it.

185
00:17:27,602 --> 00:17:28,590
Good.

186
00:17:29,101 --> 00:17:30,465
Come on, tell me what happened.

187
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:32,031
I got to go.

188
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:44,862
Spoon?

189
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:46,627
Spoon.

190
00:22:08,432 --> 00:22:09,728
Mom?

191
00:22:11,232 --> 00:22:12,459
Mom!

192
00:22:14,998 --> 00:22:17,658
My friend's coming in to
take a shower, okay?

193
00:22:18,265 --> 00:22:19,526
Okay.

194
00:22:39,965 --> 00:22:41,828
That's not really breakfast.

195
00:22:43,165 --> 00:22:44,630
You don't eat breakfast.

196
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:46,058
Well, Iet's have some.

197
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:49,322
I'll make some eggs.
I'll have some too.

198
00:22:52,032 --> 00:22:53,759
You sure you won't throw up?

199
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,059
-What's that mean?
-What do you think?

200
00:22:57,265 --> 00:22:58,423
Tell me what it means.

201
00:22:58,631 --> 00:23:00,995
-You're sneaking it.
-I'm not sneaking anything.

202
00:23:01,198 --> 00:23:02,289
Okay.

203
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:06,620
Wait, I'm sorry. You're right.

204
00:23:06,831 --> 00:23:09,456
-I want to taIk.
-You want to lle to me.

205
00:23:09,665 --> 00:23:11,597
I don't want to lle, I want to taIk.

206
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:13,661
-Do what you want.
-I want us to get aIong.

207
00:23:13,865 --> 00:23:14,853
I'm sorry.

208
00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:16,894
I can't find the tollet paper.

209
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:18,490
-Who are you?
-It's Jerry.

210
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:20,630
Get out! Get out of my house!

211
00:23:20,831 --> 00:23:21,922
-Thanks a Iot.
-Get out!

212
00:23:22,132 --> 00:23:24,495
-Do you need money for the bus?
-No, I got it.

213
00:23:24,831 --> 00:23:26,353
You said he couId take a shower.

214
00:23:26,564 --> 00:23:27,962
-I never said that!
-You did.

215
00:23:28,164 --> 00:23:30,255
I said to Iet a strange man
into my bathroom?

216
00:23:30,464 --> 00:23:32,089
He's my friend.

217
00:23:32,298 --> 00:23:33,889
You can't have a friend llke that.

218
00:23:34,131 --> 00:23:36,256
-It's for my assignment.
-What assignment?

219
00:23:36,464 --> 00:23:39,191
You won't get it.
Mr. Simonet wllI get it.

220
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:41,955
Who's Mr. Simonet?
Hey, I'm taIking--

221
00:23:42,164 --> 00:23:44,027
He's my teacher.

222
00:24:11,298 --> 00:24:12,286
Mr. Simonet?

223
00:24:12,498 --> 00:24:14,622
Yes, I'm Eugene...

224
00:24:15,164 --> 00:24:16,652
...Simonet.

225
00:24:19,664 --> 00:24:21,960
-Hello.
-Hello.

226
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,188
-What is this assignment?
-Excuse me?

227
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:29,091
What did you say for my son to
Iet a homeIess man in my house?

228
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:33,063
I have two probIems.

229
00:24:33,298 --> 00:24:35,525
One, I've no idea what
you're taIking about...

230
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,390
...and two, I don't know who you are.

231
00:24:37,597 --> 00:24:41,393
ArIene McIKinney. My boy is in your
sociaI studies cIass? Trevor?

232
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,761
Trevor.

233
00:24:43,964 --> 00:24:48,021
Yes, he's very attentive. He's very
exigent, which I llke.

234
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,892
-Exigent. Challenging, testing.
-I know what it means.

235
00:24:52,097 --> 00:24:54,460
Why did my kid bring a bum home?

236
00:24:54,664 --> 00:24:55,925
-I have no idea.
-Bullshit!

237
00:24:56,131 --> 00:24:58,221
I don't know how he interpreted
the assignment.

238
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,953
How do you think he interpreted it?

239
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,318
I don't know.

240
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,690
If you want to know, why don't you
taIk to your son?

241
00:25:05,897 --> 00:25:06,885
I taIk to him.

242
00:25:07,096 --> 00:25:08,255
Really?

243
00:25:08,463 --> 00:25:12,452
Then why did you come down here to ask
me what the assignment is?

244
00:25:14,297 --> 00:25:16,058
It's not a state secret.

245
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,091
Yeah? And?

246
00:25:22,797 --> 00:25:26,092
It's an assignment I give out at the
beginning of every year to inspire.

247
00:25:26,297 --> 00:25:28,160
I don't expect them to change the worId.

248
00:25:28,363 --> 00:25:30,386
-You don't expect them to change--
-Excuse me.

249
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,528
It's to get them to think,
not waIk on water.

250
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,820
An assignment they can't do?
What kind of teacher are you?

251
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,859
I didn't say that.
They make attempts.

252
00:25:39,063 --> 00:25:41,393
Now and then they cIean up graffiti--

253
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,061
This is my kid. You don't know him.

254
00:25:45,363 --> 00:25:47,556
Tell him he can do something,
he'll belleve you.

255
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,126
And when he can't, it'll wipe him out.

256
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,228
They ought to fire your ass
out of here right now.

257
00:25:54,696 --> 00:25:58,424
They probabIy won't do that because I
fllIed a very excellent quota.

258
00:25:58,629 --> 00:26:01,391
I'm just this side of parking in
the bIue zone.

259
00:26:01,596 --> 00:26:05,824
You think you can do whatever you want
because your face is messed up?

260
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:11,389
Why don't you put down in writing your
llttIe and Ioud compIaints...

261
00:26:11,596 --> 00:26:14,892
...and I'll make sure they get put
in the suggestion box.

262
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,655
Jesus.

263
00:26:20,263 --> 00:26:21,922
You are really something.

264
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,028
Thanks. I appreciate the euphemism.

265
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,287
I've aIways wanted to be something.

266
00:26:34,596 --> 00:26:36,755
Can I heIp you with something, miss?

267
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,892
No.

268
00:26:49,729 --> 00:26:53,718
Mr. Thorsen. HoId up, man!
I've been waiting all day for you.

269
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:57,054
-Why won't you return my calls?
-We're not friends.

270
00:26:57,262 --> 00:26:59,989
I got the pink sllp for the car.
Quite a stocking stuffer.

271
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:03,025
-You can't accept it?
-No, that wouId make me a moron.

272
00:27:03,229 --> 00:27:05,491
I just want to know about
these instructions.

273
00:27:05,696 --> 00:27:07,389
Do what they say. Pay it forward.

274
00:27:07,596 --> 00:27:09,494
-Why?
-Because you've accepted the car.

275
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,889
-You're obllgated.
-What if I don't feeI obllgated?

276
00:27:13,095 --> 00:27:16,118
What if I take my new car, get some
hookers and drive to Mexico?

277
00:27:16,329 --> 00:27:17,352
I'll never know.

278
00:27:17,562 --> 00:27:19,789
What is this? Come on, for reaI.

279
00:27:19,995 --> 00:27:22,484
An attack of totaI aItruism
from a lltigator.

280
00:27:22,696 --> 00:27:23,922
I've got a meeting.

281
00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:26,288
I've got a story. Okay?

282
00:27:26,496 --> 00:27:28,927
A partner at Channing and Moss
is giving away cars?

283
00:27:29,162 --> 00:27:32,719
Tell me a reason or I'll make one up.
Mine wllI be more interesting.

284
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:36,827
You've gone dotty, you're wearing
crystaIs, keeping too many cats at home?

285
00:27:38,828 --> 00:27:40,385
Look. Listen, pIease!

286
00:27:40,595 --> 00:27:42,652
My ex-wife has everything. Okay?

287
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:46,090
PIus, she's in a Iesbian reIationship
just to piss me off.

288
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:48,318
HeIp me out, pIease.

289
00:27:52,895 --> 00:27:54,861
My daughter has asthma.

290
00:27:55,162 --> 00:27:58,889
One night it was very bad,
the worst I'd ever seen it.

291
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:02,061
It was the middle of the night,
emergency room.

292
00:28:02,561 --> 00:28:06,050
We were waiting forever.
Couldn't get anyone to pay attention.

293
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:17,652
Her inhaIer doesn't seem
to be working.

294
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,418
Mr. Parker, what happened?

295
00:28:19,628 --> 00:28:21,924
My sister, she stabbed me.

296
00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:24,356
-We were here first.
-Stab wounds first.

297
00:28:24,561 --> 00:28:27,118
-She can't breathe. She's scared.
-I wllI Iet you know.

298
00:28:27,328 --> 00:28:29,056
Somebody has to see her.

299
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:31,794
It's never been this bad.
Do something.

300
00:28:31,995 --> 00:28:33,551
WouId you just sit down?

301
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:37,558
I'm sorry. We've been here 4 hours.
You need to get a doctor.

302
00:28:37,762 --> 00:28:39,250
No. Wait.

303
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:43,818
That's bullshit.
HeIp her right now.

304
00:28:44,028 --> 00:28:45,892
-Excuse me?
-Why you giving me shit?

305
00:28:46,094 --> 00:28:47,321
Ain't you got some oxygen?

306
00:28:47,528 --> 00:28:48,789
Let me get the supervisor.

307
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:51,620
You don't need a supervisor.
You the supervisor today.

308
00:28:51,828 --> 00:28:54,884
You are the supervisor today.
You feeI me on that?

309
00:28:55,094 --> 00:28:58,992
Take your ass down the hall, put the
girI on the tray and supervise her...

310
00:28:59,194 --> 00:29:01,819
...and get her some goddamn air.

311
00:29:02,328 --> 00:29:05,987
I got your back, sis. Bitch, you're
stllI here. Shit!

312
00:29:09,094 --> 00:29:11,855
Let go of my arm, man.
This ain't fair, man!

313
00:29:12,194 --> 00:29:14,558
Come on! Come on, man. Damn!

314
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:16,193
I thanked him...

315
00:29:16,495 --> 00:29:20,859
...and there were specifllc orifllces in
which I was told to shove my thanks.

316
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:23,118
He toId me, ''Just pay it forward.''

317
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,987
Three big favors for three other
peopIe. That's it.

318
00:29:26,194 --> 00:29:28,387
So it's llke a pass-it-on thing, then.

319
00:29:28,594 --> 00:29:31,117
You and this Iowllfe are in this chain
of do-gooders...

320
00:29:31,328 --> 00:29:34,851
...a kind of Mother Teresa conga llne?
That's a llttIe New-Agey for you.

321
00:29:35,061 --> 00:29:37,686
Sort of Tibetan? Are you in a cuIt?

322
00:29:38,594 --> 00:29:42,788
Mention my name, you'll be selling your
kidneys to pay for your Iawsuit.

323
00:29:42,994 --> 00:29:44,324
CuIt.

324
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:47,349
The guy! What was the guy's name?

325
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,254
Sorry, I'm Iate for my mass wedding.

326
00:30:19,494 --> 00:30:21,483
I know somebody's in here.

327
00:30:24,227 --> 00:30:25,853
I know you're there.

328
00:30:26,661 --> 00:30:29,422
Come out or I wllI find you
and shoot you.

329
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,388
PIease don't shoot.

330
00:30:33,727 --> 00:30:34,919
PIease.

331
00:30:35,427 --> 00:30:37,086
You stay right there.

332
00:30:37,494 --> 00:30:40,483
If I see you move one--

333
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:47,757
PIease don't pick it up!

334
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,222
PIease don't! I'm not moving.

335
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,421
PIease.

336
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,923
What are you doing to my truck?

337
00:30:59,427 --> 00:31:01,949
Let me show you. I'm just....

338
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,485
I'm just going to open the door, okay?

339
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,226
See?

340
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:21,252
Might be easier for you to sell now.
Now that it works.

341
00:31:21,493 --> 00:31:23,323
I didn't ask for your heIp.

342
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,989
You been llving in my garage?

343
00:31:26,193 --> 00:31:28,658
Not after tonight.
Can I come around and....

344
00:31:30,326 --> 00:31:33,690
I got a handyman job at the RoyaI MoteI.
They're giving me a room.

345
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:35,256
You stay right there!

346
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:37,652
PIease, I don't llke guns.

347
00:31:39,093 --> 00:31:41,581
What is going on with you and my son?

348
00:31:41,826 --> 00:31:43,257
He wanted to heIp somebody.

349
00:31:43,493 --> 00:31:47,425
Wanted to get somebody back on their
feet, so he gave me a llttIe money.

350
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,058
-He gave you money?
-Yes, ma'am.

351
00:31:50,393 --> 00:31:52,019
That's his savings.

352
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:56,684
Well, it's cIothes and shoes
and I got the job off it.

353
00:31:58,493 --> 00:32:00,220
You think you can keep it?

354
00:32:00,593 --> 00:32:03,491
Looks to me llke you've got yourseIf
a llttIe probIem.

355
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,658
I can llck it.

356
00:32:10,326 --> 00:32:12,690
How's that supposed to happen
all of a sudden?

357
00:32:13,226 --> 00:32:15,089
You ever been on the street?

358
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,649
My mom took us pretty cIose.

359
00:32:20,226 --> 00:32:24,022
Well, you can't know, not untll
you're Iooking at a dumpster.

360
00:32:24,825 --> 00:32:29,757
But when you cllmb in the first time,
and pull the newspapers over you...

361
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:33,718
...that's when you know you've
messed your llfe up.

362
00:32:34,326 --> 00:32:38,781
Somebody comes aIong llke your son
and gives me a Ieg up...

363
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:41,158
...I'll take it.

364
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,717
Even from a kid, I'll take it.

365
00:32:49,026 --> 00:32:51,685
I can't mess up again or I'll be dead.

366
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:56,054
I appreciate that you're trying to pay
back Trevor--

367
00:32:56,259 --> 00:32:58,248
I'm not allowed to pay back Trevor.

368
00:32:58,492 --> 00:33:02,050
-Then what is it you're doing?
-I'm paying it forward.

369
00:33:04,492 --> 00:33:06,355
I know you want me to go.

370
00:33:08,525 --> 00:33:09,684
I'll go.

371
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,991
What's paying it forward?

372
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,548
That's me.

373
00:33:18,292 --> 00:33:21,224
And that's three peopIe.

374
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:28,058
And I'm going to heIp them, but it has
to be something really big...

375
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:33,224
...something they can't do
by themseIves.

376
00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:35,691
So I do it for them...

377
00:33:37,091 --> 00:33:40,182
...then they do it for
three other peopIe.

378
00:33:42,191 --> 00:33:43,782
That's nine.

379
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:47,981
And I do three more....

380
00:33:48,191 --> 00:33:51,214
That's 27, so--

381
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:55,981
I'm not really good at math but it
gets big really fast. You know?

382
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:04,617
All right, all right, all right.

383
00:34:04,824 --> 00:34:06,484
A llttIe articuIation, pIease.

384
00:34:06,692 --> 00:34:08,715
-Yes?
-I think it's a good idea.

385
00:34:08,925 --> 00:34:10,857
-Shawn?
-It's stupid.

386
00:34:11,058 --> 00:34:12,388
-Adam?
-It's the honor system.

387
00:34:12,858 --> 00:34:14,915
-PeopIe bIow off the honor system.
-So what?

388
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,886
Just because you do.

389
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:22,252
Trevor, the cIass thinks that you've
come up with an overIy utopian idea.

390
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:24,390
Look that word up in a minute.

391
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:28,657
Like a perfect worId?

392
00:34:32,258 --> 00:34:33,553
So?

393
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:39,817
So what put this idea in your head?

394
00:34:43,225 --> 00:34:44,156
Because....

395
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:47,324
Everything sucks.

396
00:34:48,491 --> 00:34:49,923
He taIked to you about this?

397
00:34:50,491 --> 00:34:52,684
We've had our discussions.

398
00:34:54,457 --> 00:34:56,185
But you don't have to worry...

399
00:34:56,391 --> 00:34:59,551
...because I'll tell him we
can't taIk no more.

400
00:35:01,491 --> 00:35:03,014
No, don't do that.

401
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:06,613
WouId you llke a cup of coffee?

402
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:10,879
Yes, ma'am.

403
00:35:11,091 --> 00:35:12,556
Okay.

404
00:35:21,658 --> 00:35:24,783
I called the president
to talk aboutpollution.

405
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,616
But my mom said now they'll
put us on some llst...

406
00:35:27,824 --> 00:35:29,449
...so she hung up.

407
00:35:29,858 --> 00:35:34,119
For this assignment, I put up recycllng
fllers at two supermarkets.

408
00:35:34,324 --> 00:35:36,119
I'm going to put up a website
in Chinese.

409
00:35:36,324 --> 00:35:39,722
It'll tell all the kids in China to jump
up and down at the same time.

410
00:35:47,024 --> 00:35:49,751
The goaI being to knock
the Earth off its axis.

411
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,388
-Yeah.
-Thank you. Sit down.

412
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:57,583
Well, your ideas are as surprising
as they are variegated.

413
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:00,653
Add that to your llst of words
to Iook up.

414
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,820
But I want to focus for a moment on one
project we heard today.

415
00:36:05,391 --> 00:36:10,323
I've been teaching for many years and
it's the first new idea that aIso...

416
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:15,886
...requires an extreme act of faith in
the goodness of peopIe.

417
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:21,119
Trevor has made an attempt to
interact with the worId...

418
00:36:21,324 --> 00:36:23,256
...and that was the assignment.

419
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:27,388
And if I were an effusive person given
to easy praise...

420
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,284
...I wouId call that...

421
00:36:29,924 --> 00:36:31,355
...admirabIe.

422
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:34,579
The words from today:
utopian, enigma, quantum.

423
00:36:34,823 --> 00:36:37,051
Add variegated.
I want you to go home--

424
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:44,620
-Hey, Mr. Simonet.
-Hello.

425
00:36:55,024 --> 00:36:56,853
Were you just being nice?

426
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,017
About what?

427
00:37:00,024 --> 00:37:01,614
About my idea.

428
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:05,854
Do you think it's good or were you
just being teachery?

429
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,356
Teachery?

430
00:37:09,523 --> 00:37:10,511
Bullshitting.

431
00:37:12,556 --> 00:37:14,987
Do I strike you as someone
faIseIy nice?

432
00:37:15,757 --> 00:37:16,848
No.

433
00:37:17,623 --> 00:37:19,680
You're not even really all that nice.

434
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:26,386
Well, it was a sllp-up
and it wllI not happen again.

435
00:37:31,856 --> 00:37:32,981
What?

436
00:37:35,722 --> 00:37:37,279
What happened to your face?

437
00:37:54,656 --> 00:37:57,384
Did you draw the short straw today,
Trevor?

438
00:37:58,889 --> 00:38:02,049
It's not a very pertinent subject to
sociaI studies, is it?

439
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,388
Go and tell them that's
what I said.

440
00:38:04,589 --> 00:38:06,021
Tell who?

441
00:38:06,256 --> 00:38:07,778
I'll see you tomorrow.

442
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:36,643
-You know where Jerry is?
-Over there in 1 5.

443
00:39:08,522 --> 00:39:10,215
It's more product.

444
00:39:10,422 --> 00:39:11,910
Who is it?

445
00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:14,077
It's Trevor.

446
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:16,346
I'm Iooking for Jerry.

447
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,917
Jerry's not here.

448
00:39:21,688 --> 00:39:23,211
When wllI he be back?

449
00:39:23,422 --> 00:39:27,252
He's not coming back.
Now get out of here.

450
00:39:33,155 --> 00:39:34,314
Jerry?

451
00:39:34,521 --> 00:39:36,454
Get out of here!

452
00:39:38,688 --> 00:39:41,052
PIease come out, Jerry.

453
00:40:58,687 --> 00:41:02,642
I remember in 1 976 there were those
programs in the schooI system...

454
00:41:02,854 --> 00:41:06,446
-...and now, all that's gone.
-I gotta go.

455
00:41:09,054 --> 00:41:12,384
You ran out of cIass this morning.
I wanted to taIk to you.

456
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,777
-Hello.
-Hello.

457
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,677
Come in.

458
00:42:15,754 --> 00:42:17,481
Trevor's not feellng good.

459
00:42:17,687 --> 00:42:19,879
I'm sorry.
What's the matter?

460
00:42:20,086 --> 00:42:21,552
Just a tummy ache.

461
00:42:21,953 --> 00:42:23,419
Do you want to come in?

462
00:42:23,687 --> 00:42:25,346
Sure. Thank you.

463
00:42:27,186 --> 00:42:29,550
-Sit down.
-Thank you.

464
00:42:30,687 --> 00:42:32,743
-It's a very beautifuI home.
-Thank you.

465
00:42:32,953 --> 00:42:34,885
Have you llved in Vegas your
whoIe llfe?

466
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:36,245
Yeah.

467
00:42:43,086 --> 00:42:48,018
I toId him if you wanted to taIk to me
I wouId come to the schooI.

468
00:42:49,186 --> 00:42:52,050
Mrs. McIKinney, I didn't ask to see you.

469
00:42:53,086 --> 00:42:54,779
Well, Trevor said you did.

470
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:58,247
Yeah and he gave me a note from you...

471
00:42:59,753 --> 00:43:01,946
...which you didn't write.

472
00:43:02,186 --> 00:43:04,209
He gave you a note from me?

473
00:43:06,387 --> 00:43:10,251
Oh, God, that's horribIe.
He's been so--

474
00:43:10,452 --> 00:43:13,146
-No, I didn't mean you.
-No expIanation required.

475
00:43:13,352 --> 00:43:15,080
-Don't eIaborate.
-It's not personaI.

476
00:43:15,287 --> 00:43:17,253
-I'm used to this.
-WouId you stop?

477
00:43:17,586 --> 00:43:20,075
Can we just rewind here a llttIe bit?

478
00:43:20,686 --> 00:43:25,516
I obviousIy didn't reallze
how much Trevor llkes you.

479
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,349
That's nothing that we can't discuss
on parent-teacher night.

480
00:43:29,686 --> 00:43:31,618
Then why did you come?

481
00:43:32,886 --> 00:43:36,114
Why didn't you just tell me to
come to the schooI?

482
00:43:39,185 --> 00:43:41,743
Because you came to the schooI...

483
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:44,514
...to taIk to me about your son...

484
00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:47,185
...and I behaved llke a--

485
00:43:47,386 --> 00:43:48,682
An asshoIe?

486
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:51,610
Sorry.

487
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:54,451
Is that too traller-trash a word?

488
00:43:56,452 --> 00:43:58,645
How's ''rat bastard'' sit with you?

489
00:43:58,853 --> 00:43:59,716
It's pretty good.

490
00:44:00,586 --> 00:44:02,211
-''Dickhead''?
-Oh, I llke that.

491
00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:06,845
Look, I'm--

492
00:44:20,685 --> 00:44:22,878
I made all this food.

493
00:44:24,052 --> 00:44:25,779
It's just sitting here.

494
00:44:30,286 --> 00:44:33,116
I really don't know who eIse to
taIk to about him.

495
00:44:35,885 --> 00:44:38,283
-This is good.
-Thanks.

496
00:44:38,518 --> 00:44:40,746
I don't understand.
This is summer schooI?

497
00:44:42,386 --> 00:44:44,851
Why do you think Trevor stopped
taIking to you?

498
00:44:45,052 --> 00:44:46,449
I don't know.

499
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:49,011
He seems mad.

500
00:44:50,085 --> 00:44:52,846
Seventh grade is difficuIt,
but he seems happy at schooI.

501
00:44:54,518 --> 00:44:57,007
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's fine.

502
00:44:57,518 --> 00:44:58,779
How much do you see him?

503
00:44:59,518 --> 00:45:01,609
-As much as I can.
-How much is that?

504
00:45:02,685 --> 00:45:07,050
I'm not doing a bunch of skanky guys
instead of spending time with my son.

505
00:45:07,818 --> 00:45:09,545
I got two jobs.

506
00:45:11,351 --> 00:45:13,749
Right. I meant that.

507
00:45:14,184 --> 00:45:16,150
CouIdn't have just been a question.

508
00:45:20,485 --> 00:45:23,849
Mrs. McIKinney, do you think there
might be something...

509
00:45:24,084 --> 00:45:27,050
...outside of schooI that might be
bothering him?

510
00:45:28,285 --> 00:45:29,683
I don't know.

511
00:45:31,919 --> 00:45:34,908
I'm going to have to consuIt
my spirit guides here.

512
00:45:35,118 --> 00:45:37,414
You tell me Trevor's withhoIding
from you...

513
00:45:37,618 --> 00:45:41,345
...but won't tell me anything specific,
and you want me to divine why.

514
00:45:41,818 --> 00:45:45,545
Divine why?
You aIways taIk llke that?

515
00:45:45,752 --> 00:45:46,775
Yes.

516
00:45:46,984 --> 00:45:49,473
You go to some big fancy schooI?

517
00:45:49,984 --> 00:45:51,109
Yes.

518
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:53,840
Think you couId stop rubbing
my nose in it?

519
00:45:59,817 --> 00:46:01,147
Is there a father?

520
00:46:01,618 --> 00:46:03,641
He doesn't llve here anymore.

521
00:46:04,184 --> 00:46:05,774
I don't know where he is.

522
00:46:05,984 --> 00:46:08,007
I know what that's llke.

523
00:46:08,617 --> 00:46:12,414
ArIene, I've called you five times.

524
00:46:12,617 --> 00:46:13,605
-Bonnie.
-No, llsten.

525
00:46:13,817 --> 00:46:17,544
You don't call your sponsor once in
a whlle, you don't have a sponsor.

526
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,280
This is Eugene Simonet.

527
00:46:21,151 --> 00:46:23,140
You're not supposed to date for
a year.

528
00:46:23,351 --> 00:46:25,782
-It isn't a date.
-No, I'm Trevor's teacher.

529
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:27,377
We're having a conference.

530
00:46:29,018 --> 00:46:30,314
We're done.

531
00:46:30,517 --> 00:46:31,778
Were done.

532
00:46:51,018 --> 00:46:52,643
How couId you do that to me?

533
00:46:53,151 --> 00:46:55,140
Write a Ietter to him, sign my name?

534
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:58,908
-Why'd you have to mess everything up?
-I didn't mess this up.

535
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:02,140
What were you doing?
Standing at the door llstening?

536
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:05,441
-What happened to your stomachache?
-Why? You aIways lle.

537
00:47:05,651 --> 00:47:08,446
This wasn't my fauIt.
This was embarrassing.

538
00:47:08,651 --> 00:47:10,549
I did something good
and you don't know it.

539
00:47:10,751 --> 00:47:12,649
Honey, llsten.

540
00:47:13,684 --> 00:47:17,616
You can't just put two peopIe together
and make them llke each other.

541
00:47:17,817 --> 00:47:20,339
You onIy llke peopIe you
can get drunk with.

542
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:24,475
You're waiting for him to come back.

543
00:47:24,684 --> 00:47:26,343
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are!

544
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:27,777
No, I'm not!

545
00:47:28,017 --> 00:47:30,677
-Your father's not getting his foot--
-That's what you aIways say.

546
00:47:30,883 --> 00:47:32,872
-I mean it now.
-You aIways mean it.

547
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:36,015
What do you want me to say?
I say it, I mean it.

548
00:47:36,217 --> 00:47:39,240
When he's around you don't care
what happens to me.

549
00:47:39,484 --> 00:47:40,949
You don't even know I'm in the house.

550
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,139
-That's not true.
-It's true.

551
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:45,009
I Iove you.

552
00:47:45,217 --> 00:47:46,205
I Iove you.

553
00:47:46,417 --> 00:47:47,712
I'm doing the best I can.

554
00:47:47,917 --> 00:47:49,383
Don't Iove me.
I hate the way you Iook.

555
00:47:49,584 --> 00:47:50,981
Trevor, you need to stop.

556
00:47:51,183 --> 00:47:52,479
I hate that you're my mother.

557
00:49:43,049 --> 00:49:45,174
Trev, I'm going to come in, okay?

558
00:49:55,582 --> 00:49:57,514
You said that an hour ago.

559
00:49:58,982 --> 00:50:01,675
Do you understand my kid is missing?

560
00:50:03,682 --> 00:50:06,910
If I had a car I'd be out
Iooking for him!

561
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:20,882
What time do you think he took off?

562
00:50:21,181 --> 00:50:24,841
I don't know.
I'm sorry to do this to you.

563
00:50:25,081 --> 00:50:27,673
Bonnie wasn't home.
The cops wouIdn't come.

564
00:50:27,882 --> 00:50:30,439
And my friends are all drunks.

565
00:50:30,649 --> 00:50:32,877
-It's okay.
-And so am I.

566
00:50:33,415 --> 00:50:34,971
I'm a drunk too.

567
00:50:38,981 --> 00:50:42,311
I belleve some peopIe refer to
that as ''in recovery.''

568
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:52,946
Where are you going?

569
00:51:19,547 --> 00:51:20,774
Got enough?

570
00:51:20,981 --> 00:51:24,606
Need a ticket somewhere? Come on,
I'll get you a ticket.

571
00:51:24,814 --> 00:51:26,246
Come with me. I'll get you a ticket.

572
00:51:26,448 --> 00:51:28,811
I'll get you a ticket,
you son of a bitch!

573
00:51:29,015 --> 00:51:30,742
Honey, are you okay?

574
00:51:51,314 --> 00:51:54,303
For the rest of my llfe, I can
never be as sorry...

575
00:51:54,514 --> 00:51:57,173
...as I am for what I did to you.

576
00:52:05,147 --> 00:52:06,773
I didn't drink.

577
00:52:07,381 --> 00:52:09,813
I wanted to, but I didn't.

578
00:52:19,247 --> 00:52:21,543
You got no reason to trust me...

579
00:52:22,881 --> 00:52:26,210
...and I know you don't want to hear
any more promises...

580
00:52:27,047 --> 00:52:29,104
...so I'm just gonna tell you
the truth.

581
00:52:32,047 --> 00:52:33,570
I have a probIem.

582
00:52:35,214 --> 00:52:38,112
I have a really bad probIem.

583
00:52:39,314 --> 00:52:40,939
I've got to stop.

584
00:52:44,281 --> 00:52:46,338
And if you can be with me on this...

585
00:52:46,547 --> 00:52:51,377
...if you can think it's possibIe
that I can do it...

586
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,039
...then I think maybe I can.

587
00:52:56,747 --> 00:52:58,179
If you just...

588
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,474
...try a llttIe bit and heIp--

589
00:53:24,847 --> 00:53:25,835
You're stllI here?

590
00:53:26,047 --> 00:53:27,876
I hope it's okay.

591
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,069
-He's asIeep.
-Good, okay.

592
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,042
How did you know where he was?

593
00:53:32,613 --> 00:53:36,238
Well, kids, they either hitchhike
or they take a bus.

594
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:38,412
-Listen--
-You're weIcome.

595
00:53:39,713 --> 00:53:40,974
No, you don't have to.

596
00:53:41,179 --> 00:53:44,839
-I understand--
-Wait. Goddamn, I want to thank you.

597
00:53:47,313 --> 00:53:48,677
Thank you.

598
00:53:49,014 --> 00:53:50,206
You're weIcome.

599
00:53:53,613 --> 00:53:55,806
-Wasn't quite worth it, was it?
-No.

600
00:53:56,546 --> 00:54:00,171
I was wondering, do you want to come
back here sometime?

601
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,039
Have dinner with me?

602
00:54:06,446 --> 00:54:11,208
I'm not entireIy sure
that wouId be appropriate.

603
00:54:12,046 --> 00:54:14,807
Okay. I understand.

604
00:54:15,613 --> 00:54:17,306
-Good night.
-Good night.

605
00:54:29,713 --> 00:54:32,474
Why'd you do that man
the favor, Sidney?

606
00:54:33,713 --> 00:54:35,679
No, it's llke three favors, pIayer.

607
00:54:35,879 --> 00:54:37,402
You got to do three.

608
00:54:37,646 --> 00:54:40,237
I'll do the other two here
for my foIks.

609
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,207
A Iot of brothers need favors in here.

610
00:54:42,413 --> 00:54:44,311
But who toId you to do it?

611
00:54:47,912 --> 00:54:50,606
It's llke this idea I got.

612
00:54:52,346 --> 00:54:53,743
You gonna put this on TV?

613
00:54:53,979 --> 00:54:56,502
How did you come up with
an idea llke that?

614
00:54:57,812 --> 00:54:59,506
Man, it's llke....

615
00:55:00,413 --> 00:55:04,311
It's llke the worId is a shithoIe.
Excuse my French and shit.

616
00:55:04,512 --> 00:55:05,739
And it's llke...

617
00:55:06,812 --> 00:55:09,244
...I just thought, llke, boom!

618
00:55:09,479 --> 00:55:12,412
Like the whoIe shit couId be,
llke, better.

619
00:55:14,046 --> 00:55:15,909
It didn't start with anyone eIse?

620
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:18,709
No, nigger.
That shit came from here.

621
00:55:18,912 --> 00:55:21,503
The shit came from my head.
I can't lle.

622
00:55:21,712 --> 00:55:26,371
I been through some heavy-ass shit.

623
00:55:27,113 --> 00:55:29,840
But not no more,
because it changed me.

624
00:55:30,046 --> 00:55:31,671
And I'm changing this pIace, man.

625
00:55:31,879 --> 00:55:34,674
I mean, peopIe are llstening to me.

626
00:55:34,879 --> 00:55:36,868
PeopIe are staying cIean.

627
00:55:39,178 --> 00:55:43,804
I mean, it's llke some cosmic
AristotIe shit. You feeI me?

628
00:55:44,645 --> 00:55:46,702
-Yeah.
-Yeah, no doubt.

629
00:55:46,912 --> 00:55:49,173
-I feeI you.
-No doubt, dog, no doubt.

630
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,167
The thing is, Sidney...

631
00:55:54,545 --> 00:55:57,875
...somebody eIse is saying
that pay it forward was their idea.

632
00:55:59,779 --> 00:56:00,540
Who?

633
00:56:05,707 --> 00:56:06,798
I think you know who.

634
00:56:09,507 --> 00:56:10,495
That bitch?

635
00:56:11,407 --> 00:56:12,997
She a Iying-ass bitch.

636
00:56:13,206 --> 00:56:16,070
She's a Iying bitch.
She's got your head.

637
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:18,330
She makes a pretty good case,
though, Sid.

638
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,096
That oId crusty bag Iady?

639
00:56:20,306 --> 00:56:23,101
This is all from me.
All from my heart, dog.

640
00:56:23,306 --> 00:56:26,999
Sidney, it doesn't matter if you got
it from the Iady or not.

641
00:56:27,206 --> 00:56:28,762
You're the one paying it forward.

642
00:56:28,973 --> 00:56:31,666
In prison, no Iess.
The paroIe board wllI eat that up.

643
00:56:33,672 --> 00:56:35,900
-Oh, the paroIe board.
-The paroIe board.

644
00:56:37,573 --> 00:56:40,539
Oh, snap, yo. You good, man.

645
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:43,331
It's llke a carrot for
the mouse and shit.

646
00:56:44,572 --> 00:56:48,902
No doubt. It's too bad my paroIe don't
come up for another year, B.

647
00:56:52,373 --> 00:56:55,702
What if I can make it so your paroIe
comes up next month?

648
00:58:14,272 --> 00:58:15,669
Hello.

649
00:58:16,872 --> 00:58:18,963
Oh, hello.

650
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,395
Did you know I worked here?

651
00:58:23,805 --> 00:58:25,600
No, I didn't. Really.

652
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,531
Just dropped in for
a llttIe game of craps?

653
00:58:33,972 --> 00:58:36,665
No, I llke that coffee shop.

654
00:58:37,272 --> 00:58:38,931
They have good food.

655
00:58:40,072 --> 00:58:42,503
Yeah, they got good pancakes.

656
00:58:43,671 --> 00:58:44,796
Yeah.

657
00:58:45,671 --> 00:58:46,864
FIuffy.

658
00:58:49,072 --> 00:58:52,061
-Want me to bring you back something?
-Oh, no, thanks.

659
00:58:52,304 --> 00:58:55,293
-I get off in an hour.
-Really?

660
00:58:56,139 --> 00:58:57,832
Yeah, really.

661
00:59:01,505 --> 00:59:05,130
Well, if you were going to eat
anyway then....

662
00:59:07,238 --> 00:59:09,227
If you wanted, maybe....

663
00:59:10,738 --> 00:59:12,795
If you were hungry, we couId....

664
00:59:13,705 --> 00:59:16,296
We couId, if you were,
if you want to...

665
00:59:19,772 --> 00:59:21,237
...eat something...

666
00:59:23,038 --> 00:59:24,470
...sometime.

667
00:59:29,571 --> 00:59:31,400
Give me a seven iron, pIease.

668
00:59:31,605 --> 00:59:32,730
Yes, sir.

669
00:59:44,605 --> 00:59:46,070
May I heIp you?

670
00:59:47,204 --> 00:59:49,102
I am not staIking the governor, Jordy.

671
00:59:50,038 --> 00:59:51,731
Shit. ChandIer.

672
00:59:52,904 --> 00:59:55,734
You scared me. You Iook llke crap.
What are you doing here?

673
00:59:55,937 --> 00:59:58,732
-I want to taIk to him, Jordan.
-Your questions piss him off.

674
00:59:58,937 --> 01:00:00,800
-Is that why I got the bounce?
-He won't taIk to you.

675
01:00:01,004 --> 01:00:02,936
-Tell him I'm a candygram.
-Stop it.

676
01:00:03,138 --> 01:00:06,468
I've been sitting on a story for
2 years about a party he had.

677
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:11,126
The cIean-up crew found syringes,
size 1 2 high heeIs, animaI droppings.

678
01:00:11,338 --> 01:00:13,236
That can't be right, can it?

679
01:00:14,804 --> 01:00:16,293
You really had this, you'd have used it.

680
01:00:16,537 --> 01:00:18,833
Bullshit. His friends in high pIaces
had me kllI it...

681
01:00:19,038 --> 01:00:22,095
...but since I got fired,
I'm not feellng that IoyaI.

682
01:00:23,504 --> 01:00:26,027
-What do you want?
-Four mllllon dollars.

683
01:00:27,504 --> 01:00:29,402
I'm kidding, man. ReIax.

684
01:00:30,904 --> 01:00:32,927
A phone call.
I just need a phone call.

685
01:00:33,138 --> 01:00:36,729
I need a massage for a friend's
paroIe date. That's it.

686
01:00:42,804 --> 01:00:45,269
-They kept me 40 minutes over.
-Did you call him?

687
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:48,800
I couIdn't remember the name of the
restaurant. I remember the hoteI--

688
01:00:49,004 --> 01:00:52,561
If you're Iate he thinks
it means you don't respect him.

689
01:00:52,771 --> 01:00:53,600
What?

690
01:00:53,804 --> 01:00:56,964
If you're Iate, he'll think it means
you don't respect him.

691
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:06,036
Wear this.

692
01:01:06,237 --> 01:01:09,226
-I want to wear the green dress.
-You Iook llke a vampire in that.

693
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:10,992
I got to take a shower.

694
01:01:11,203 --> 01:01:12,862
-What?
-I smell horribIe.

695
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:16,525
No, you don't! You smell good.
You smell llke roses or something.

696
01:01:16,737 --> 01:01:19,362
Let me just wash under my arms.
Are you sure?

697
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:20,661
Yeah, I'm sure.

698
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:34,232
Don't interrupt him in
the middIe of a sentence.

699
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:36,236
Am I supposed to raise my hand?

700
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:39,027
-Get me my shoes. Those sandaIs.
-No, these.

701
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,100
I'm not wearing those.
They're too sexy.

702
01:01:41,303 --> 01:01:42,996
You're Iate. You owe him.

703
01:01:43,203 --> 01:01:46,363
-I owe him? Who are you?
-Go.

704
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:51,097
No stupid jokes! He's not
that kind of person.

705
01:01:51,303 --> 01:01:55,326
Thank you very much. Where's the phone?
I got to call for a cab.

706
01:01:55,536 --> 01:01:57,900
If I take a bus, I'll be
another hour Iate.

707
01:01:58,137 --> 01:02:01,297
-Stop yapping.
-I've got to call for a cab.

708
01:02:04,037 --> 01:02:05,333
Oh, my God!

709
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:09,335
Oh, my God. You're just about....

710
01:02:09,536 --> 01:02:11,866
You're the greatest son in the worId!

711
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:15,263
Okay, you have to go.
Here, here.

712
01:02:15,469 --> 01:02:16,662
Go, go.

713
01:02:17,336 --> 01:02:19,666
-Lock both doors!
-I wllI.

714
01:02:21,836 --> 01:02:24,802
-I Iove you!
-Love you too, Mom.

715
01:02:49,569 --> 01:02:51,159
I respect you!

716
01:02:52,703 --> 01:02:54,293
They kept me Iate at work...

717
01:02:54,503 --> 01:02:57,264
...and then I got on the bus to go
home and change, which was stupid.

718
01:02:57,469 --> 01:02:59,458
I'm sorry, but I was all the way--

719
01:03:01,202 --> 01:03:02,792
You're right on time.

720
01:03:17,036 --> 01:03:18,229
I'm sorry.

721
01:03:33,835 --> 01:03:37,233
I was llving in Vegas. One night I
was waIking down the street.

722
01:03:37,435 --> 01:03:39,594
Minding my own. Wasn't doing
nothing to nobody.

723
01:03:40,236 --> 01:03:42,168
I wasjust on my way to church.

724
01:03:44,435 --> 01:03:47,993
Out of nowhere these five BIoods just
peeIed out of a truck.

725
01:03:48,202 --> 01:03:51,361
And one of them, man,
was real black.

726
01:03:51,835 --> 01:03:54,733
Man, I start swinging one by one
llke, ''Nigger, take that!''

727
01:03:54,935 --> 01:03:57,400
Like Ali on them bitches.
I was like....

728
01:03:58,202 --> 01:04:00,134
''What's up, nigger, what's up?''

729
01:04:00,869 --> 01:04:04,733
All fllve of them got up
and started chasing me, man.

730
01:04:04,935 --> 01:04:06,730
''We going to kill you, Crip. ''

731
01:04:06,935 --> 01:04:09,230
I was like,
''You can't catch me, Blood. ''

732
01:04:10,201 --> 01:04:13,690
Then, man, all ofa sudden,
out ofnowhere...

733
01:04:13,902 --> 01:04:16,231
...that's when I ran into
this old lady.

734
01:04:16,535 --> 01:04:18,398
That's who you want to know about.

735
01:04:29,035 --> 01:04:30,160
Shit!

736
01:04:31,769 --> 01:04:34,462
Hey, you in troubIe?

737
01:04:36,168 --> 01:04:38,259
-What?
-Get in.

738
01:04:39,668 --> 01:04:40,963
Get in?

739
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:42,759
Come on, get in.

740
01:04:46,668 --> 01:04:47,826
Shit!

741
01:05:35,634 --> 01:05:36,759
What are we doing?

742
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,726
Whatever we want.

743
01:05:43,401 --> 01:05:44,389
Damn!

744
01:05:44,601 --> 01:05:49,329
You think I'm going for your dried-up
crusty ass? Whatever.

745
01:05:49,534 --> 01:05:52,728
Shoot. I smell better than you do.

746
01:05:53,701 --> 01:05:54,894
Yeah, all right.

747
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:58,098
All right, so what?
What you want?

748
01:05:59,634 --> 01:06:01,065
Don't matter...

749
01:06:01,267 --> 01:06:04,700
...because you ain't going to do it.

750
01:06:07,067 --> 01:06:10,295
You damn right about that. Shit.

751
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,359
Hey, not in my car.

752
01:06:14,734 --> 01:06:16,632
Shit, not in my car.

753
01:06:16,933 --> 01:06:18,797
Oh, my bad. My bad.

754
01:06:19,067 --> 01:06:23,022
This is your pad? You don't want me
to jack up your pretty curtains.

755
01:06:23,234 --> 01:06:25,530
Son of a bitch.

756
01:06:25,734 --> 01:06:29,859
I paid it forward for a hophead
son of a bitch.

757
01:06:31,134 --> 01:06:33,623
You paid it what? I didn't hear that.

758
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:38,698
I ain't going to tell you because your
ass ain't good enough to touch it.

759
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:41,059
Oh, my ass ain't good enough, huh?

760
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,793
Now you gonna tell me.

761
01:06:48,467 --> 01:06:51,365
You gonna tell me.

762
01:06:51,566 --> 01:06:55,658
An oId bat llving in her car in Las
Vegas tells you about pay it forward?

763
01:06:55,867 --> 01:06:59,391
She ain't want to, but I wouIdn't
stop untll she Iet it out.

764
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,589
What I really want to know is why?

765
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,857
Why did you pay it forward?

766
01:07:05,867 --> 01:07:10,765
Because don't nobody tell me what
I can and can't touch.

767
01:07:12,633 --> 01:07:15,156
You're not supposed to date
for a year.

768
01:07:15,366 --> 01:07:16,798
They're not dates.

769
01:07:17,034 --> 01:07:18,499
Seven dinners. What are they?

770
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,757
-It's a coupIe of aduIts sitting down.
-Does he pay?

771
01:07:21,967 --> 01:07:24,797
-He pays for everything.
-Did anybody ask you?

772
01:07:25,034 --> 01:07:27,329
-He doesn't know many peopIe.
-He llkes her.

773
01:07:27,533 --> 01:07:30,091
-So?
-He fixed your TV remote.

774
01:07:30,299 --> 01:07:33,561
-That's an engagement ring.
-And he doesn't drink.

775
01:07:33,767 --> 01:07:36,756
Don't you got to pee? Look.

776
01:07:39,033 --> 01:07:41,625
-I need a smoke.
-Yeah. Over there.

777
01:07:42,033 --> 01:07:45,557
-So has he kissed you?
-No, no, no, no.

778
01:07:45,767 --> 01:07:47,528
Does he want to?

779
01:07:48,733 --> 01:07:50,960
Sometimes I think he does.

780
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:54,529
He can't really want to
or he wouId've.

781
01:07:55,633 --> 01:07:56,792
Do you want him to?

782
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,892
I don't know.

783
01:08:01,733 --> 01:08:03,562
It's just taking forever.

784
01:08:04,767 --> 01:08:08,199
You ever gotten to know somebody
before you went to bed with him?

785
01:08:14,732 --> 01:08:17,460
-Is that bad?
-It's pathetic.

786
01:08:26,099 --> 01:08:27,531
Well, good night.

787
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,093
Do you want to come in?

788
01:08:33,499 --> 01:08:35,897
And stay?

789
01:08:39,665 --> 01:08:40,653
Come in.

790
01:08:44,033 --> 01:08:46,124
Trevor's inside the house.

791
01:08:46,333 --> 01:08:48,594
Well, he sIeeps llke the dead.

792
01:08:50,832 --> 01:08:53,389
I don't want to make it any
harder for you.

793
01:08:54,499 --> 01:08:57,556
You're supposed to wait a year.
Isn't that what Bonnie said?

794
01:08:57,766 --> 01:08:59,254
Okay.

795
01:09:05,298 --> 01:09:06,821
I can't.

796
01:09:12,033 --> 01:09:13,555
I'm sorry.

797
01:09:14,832 --> 01:09:16,991
No. I don't mean I can't.

798
01:09:20,432 --> 01:09:21,864
It's just....

799
01:09:22,632 --> 01:09:23,928
What?

800
01:09:27,832 --> 01:09:29,821
This is compllcated.

801
01:09:31,866 --> 01:09:36,230
I get it. It's okay to say you
don't llke me that way.

802
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:42,558
Is that what you think it is?

803
01:09:43,332 --> 01:09:44,820
It's okay.

804
01:09:48,732 --> 01:09:50,754
How couId you ever think that?

805
01:10:27,531 --> 01:10:28,622
What?

806
01:10:29,664 --> 01:10:31,153
What is it?

807
01:10:57,297 --> 01:11:00,821
-And you're doing this because?
-I need more llnks.

808
01:11:01,164 --> 01:11:04,096
You're spending $300 to find
an oId Iady...

809
01:11:04,331 --> 01:11:06,763
...so you can sell a story for $300.

810
01:11:06,997 --> 01:11:10,054
It's a news magazine feature. It's
not something you wipe your ass with.

811
01:11:10,264 --> 01:11:13,594
You have a IoveIy way of
expressing yourseIf.

812
01:11:13,831 --> 01:11:16,990
Do me a favor.
Don't change the Iocks on me, okay?

813
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:19,557
Chris? What are you hoping this'll be?

814
01:11:19,765 --> 01:11:22,162
You know, something that cIears a check.

815
01:11:23,698 --> 01:11:25,357
Are you sure that's all?

816
01:11:25,564 --> 01:11:29,291
I drank the Iast of the coffee.
PIease put it on the llst.

817
01:11:34,398 --> 01:11:35,421
Bye.

818
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,952
Who's there?

819
01:12:03,097 --> 01:12:05,063
-Do you Iook down on me?
-What?

820
01:12:05,264 --> 01:12:07,287
-Do you Iook down on me?
-No.

821
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:10,258
I don't taIk llke you. I haven't
read the stuff you read.

822
01:12:10,463 --> 01:12:12,191
That's not pertinent,
and you know it.

823
01:12:12,397 --> 01:12:15,057
Don't taIk to me llke that!

824
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:19,554
I'm sorry, but that's the way I taIk.
Words are all I have.

825
01:12:19,764 --> 01:12:20,752
Why?

826
01:12:20,964 --> 01:12:24,055
Why, because you think you Iook
llke shit?

827
01:12:24,263 --> 01:12:27,252
I don't care about your burns,
if that's what they are.

828
01:12:27,463 --> 01:12:30,089
-Is that what they are?
-Yes.

829
01:12:30,296 --> 01:12:34,786
Okay, well, whatever happened to you,
you Iook good to me.

830
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:40,328
Well, you Iook good to me too.

831
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:42,587
Okay, so?

832
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:48,257
So I've never been here before.

833
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:51,625
Okay, so you're scared.
I'm scared too.

834
01:12:51,864 --> 01:12:54,796
Listen, bad things have happened
to me, okay?

835
01:12:55,030 --> 01:12:58,087
I can't take my shirt off with a guy
without five beers...

836
01:12:58,296 --> 01:13:00,319
...but I want that with you.

837
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:03,223
More than I'm scared, I want that.

838
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:18,855
You don't see me.

839
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:22,726
My llfe....

840
01:13:26,863 --> 01:13:30,296
My llfe is famlliar. My llfe is....

841
01:13:30,629 --> 01:13:32,095
It's manageabIe.

842
01:13:32,296 --> 01:13:35,057
It's manageabIe. Every day.

843
01:13:35,929 --> 01:13:38,088
I have a thing I do every day.

844
01:13:38,296 --> 01:13:40,023
It's all I've ever known.

845
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:43,128
And it's a routine and as Iong
as I have that...

846
01:13:43,363 --> 01:13:46,692
...as Iong as I have that, I'm okay.

847
01:13:46,896 --> 01:13:48,623
If I don't have it, I'm Iost.

848
01:13:48,863 --> 01:13:52,556
So is that all you want?
Your goddamn manageabIe day?

849
01:13:52,763 --> 01:13:54,456
-It's what I have.
-It isn't.

850
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:57,287
-Is it what you want?
-Yes!

851
01:13:57,529 --> 01:13:58,961
I don't belleve you.

852
01:14:04,229 --> 01:14:06,093
Okay. That's the best I got.

853
01:14:06,295 --> 01:14:07,955
-It's not about you.
-Yes, it is!

854
01:14:08,195 --> 01:14:11,855
Something's been offered to you here
and you don't want it.

855
01:14:12,063 --> 01:14:13,722
Maybe you're scared to get rejected.

856
01:14:13,929 --> 01:14:16,326
I can't reject you.
You're too quick for me.

857
01:14:42,396 --> 01:14:44,589
You didn't call me a fag, did you?

858
01:14:49,895 --> 01:14:51,054
Look what I found.

859
01:14:51,262 --> 01:14:53,592
Give me that! That's my asthma spray!

860
01:14:53,795 --> 01:14:56,159
-Shut up!
-Stop it!

861
01:14:56,362 --> 01:14:57,827
-Stay stllI!
-Stop! HeIp me!

862
01:14:58,029 --> 01:14:59,290
-HoId stllI!
-Stop!

863
01:15:03,995 --> 01:15:05,461
Hey, McIKinney.

864
01:15:06,029 --> 01:15:06,960
Come here.

865
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:09,117
Let's hang out.

866
01:15:10,195 --> 01:15:12,820
HeIp me, pIease.

867
01:15:13,029 --> 01:15:14,585
Screw it. Come on.

868
01:15:16,062 --> 01:15:17,994
Let me go! Let me go!

869
01:15:38,428 --> 01:15:40,122
You cut my cIass.

870
01:15:42,294 --> 01:15:44,090
It's been four days.

871
01:15:45,628 --> 01:15:47,117
What's been four days?

872
01:15:48,228 --> 01:15:51,285
Why haven't you called my mother?
It's been four days.

873
01:15:59,094 --> 01:16:00,583
I don't know.

874
01:16:03,395 --> 01:16:04,827
Neither does she.

875
01:16:14,228 --> 01:16:15,694
Hey, what's the matter?

876
01:16:21,561 --> 01:16:23,356
Pay it forward didn't work.

877
01:16:24,528 --> 01:16:26,221
I couIdn't even do it.

878
01:16:31,861 --> 01:16:33,691
I was gonna heIp Adam.

879
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:40,351
HeIp Adam do what?

880
01:16:41,561 --> 01:16:43,186
Not get beat up.

881
01:16:44,361 --> 01:16:46,418
But I crapped out and I Iet him.

882
01:16:50,528 --> 01:16:52,187
I Iet him get beat.

883
01:16:53,761 --> 01:16:56,387
No. you didn't.
You didn't Iet him get beat.

884
01:16:56,594 --> 01:16:58,083
It happened.

885
01:16:58,861 --> 01:17:01,225
Sometimes there's nothing we can do.

886
01:17:04,094 --> 01:17:05,321
-It's not fair.
-I know--

887
01:17:05,527 --> 01:17:08,255
No. You don't know.

888
01:17:10,028 --> 01:17:11,687
You shouId call my mother.

889
01:17:11,894 --> 01:17:14,019
You couId do something if you wanted.

890
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:18,188
-Why are you chicken?
-I'm not chicken.

891
01:17:18,394 --> 01:17:21,054
Something's gonna happen,
then it'll be too Iate.

892
01:17:24,694 --> 01:17:26,717
What's gonna happen?
What do you mean?

893
01:17:28,494 --> 01:17:29,926
He'll come back.

894
01:17:32,394 --> 01:17:33,883
Who wllI come back?

895
01:17:34,861 --> 01:17:36,588
Hey, who wllI come--?

896
01:17:42,594 --> 01:17:43,958
Your dad.

897
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,258
Your dad wllI come back?

898
01:17:54,027 --> 01:17:55,015
And...

899
01:17:58,193 --> 01:18:01,091
...what wllI happen when he
comes back, Trevor?

900
01:18:04,761 --> 01:18:06,454
WllI he hurt you?

901
01:18:12,627 --> 01:18:14,422
WllI he hurt her?

902
01:18:21,293 --> 01:18:23,054
Not if someone's there...

903
01:18:25,193 --> 01:18:26,852
...instead of him.

904
01:18:35,993 --> 01:18:37,084
Trevor, it's...

905
01:18:37,693 --> 01:18:40,591
...compllcated for me now.

906
01:18:44,526 --> 01:18:46,992
Is the worId just shit?

907
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:52,292
No, it isn't.

908
01:18:55,926 --> 01:18:57,551
You did good work.

909
01:18:57,860 --> 01:19:00,224
Look at me.
I'm proud of you, Trevor.

910
01:19:00,593 --> 01:19:02,150
I'm proud of you.

911
01:19:06,259 --> 01:19:08,350
And anyway, for what it's worth...

912
01:19:09,426 --> 01:19:12,256
...I'm grading you on the effort,
not the resuIt.

913
01:19:17,027 --> 01:19:18,925
I don't care about the grade.

914
01:19:33,926 --> 01:19:36,790
I just wanted to see if the worId
wouId really change.

915
01:20:21,925 --> 01:20:23,186
Come in.

916
01:22:21,624 --> 01:22:22,555
Trevor!

917
01:22:23,357 --> 01:22:24,653
-It worked!
-Oh, God.

918
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:31,647
-Does he aIways get up earIy?
-What?

919
01:22:31,858 --> 01:22:33,085
He just saw me.

920
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:34,950
-It's okay.
-I'm his teacher.

921
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:36,918
Now you have to pay it forward too.

922
01:22:37,125 --> 01:22:38,351
Eugene!

923
01:22:38,858 --> 01:22:40,824
You shouId stllI call me Mr. Simonet.

924
01:22:41,025 --> 01:22:42,183
You had a sIeepover.

925
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:43,516
-Go back to bed.
-Why?

926
01:22:43,724 --> 01:22:45,690
It's too earIy and I got to
get to schooI.

927
01:22:45,891 --> 01:22:48,379
-No, it's a Sunday.
-It's a Sunday?

928
01:22:48,591 --> 01:22:49,921
It's a Sunday?

929
01:22:50,124 --> 01:22:51,522
Stay. Mom wllI make breakfast.

930
01:22:51,724 --> 01:22:55,383
I have a scheduIe that you
don't know about every Sunday.

931
01:22:55,591 --> 01:22:57,954
WllI you take care of him?
I'll call you Iater.

932
01:22:58,190 --> 01:22:59,951
Don't be a stranger!

933
01:23:00,724 --> 01:23:01,621
You llke him?

934
01:24:26,356 --> 01:24:27,720
Lady, come on.

935
01:24:28,156 --> 01:24:29,144
Go away.

936
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:31,818
I'm not going to hurt you, Iady.

937
01:24:32,023 --> 01:24:33,216
Here, take it.

938
01:24:33,423 --> 01:24:35,719
It's a nice thought
but it's not what I want.

939
01:24:37,956 --> 01:24:39,252
What are you doing?

940
01:24:39,456 --> 01:24:41,012
I'm not going to hurt you!

941
01:24:44,056 --> 01:24:46,454
Oh, my God. Listen to me.

942
01:24:47,089 --> 01:24:50,283
Nothing's this important.
Come down here.

943
01:24:50,523 --> 01:24:51,489
What are you doing?

944
01:24:51,690 --> 01:24:54,121
What do you care anyway?

945
01:24:54,356 --> 01:24:55,754
Because I owe somebody a favor.

946
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:57,647
Not me.

947
01:24:57,856 --> 01:24:59,322
Why not you?

948
01:24:59,523 --> 01:25:02,045
You know, a minute ago...

949
01:25:02,256 --> 01:25:06,245
...all I couId think about
was getting my next fix.

950
01:25:06,456 --> 01:25:10,945
And then I saw you
and I changed my thinking.

951
01:25:11,156 --> 01:25:13,452
Oh, pIease. Go away.

952
01:25:13,689 --> 01:25:15,780
Trust me. I'm not worth it.

953
01:25:16,289 --> 01:25:17,516
Why is that?

954
01:25:18,356 --> 01:25:20,219
-For God's sake.
-Come on, tell me.

955
01:25:20,423 --> 01:25:22,218
Why are you not worth it?

956
01:25:23,856 --> 01:25:27,414
Trust me. You wouIdn't understand.

957
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:31,450
Are you kidding me?
You think I llve at the Ritz?

958
01:25:35,189 --> 01:25:37,450
Have a cup of coffee with me.

959
01:25:39,522 --> 01:25:40,579
What?

960
01:25:48,522 --> 01:25:50,113
Do me a favor.

961
01:25:52,622 --> 01:25:54,281
Save my llfe.

962
01:26:02,956 --> 01:26:04,979
Get him, get him! Off the ropes!

963
01:26:05,589 --> 01:26:06,987
He missed him!

964
01:26:08,255 --> 01:26:09,482
He's dead!

965
01:26:12,088 --> 01:26:14,316
Come on, bIeed, dude.

966
01:26:15,122 --> 01:26:16,088
Give him a DDT.

967
01:26:16,988 --> 01:26:18,784
-What?
-It's gonna be a DDT.

968
01:26:18,988 --> 01:26:20,477
Drop him on his ass!

969
01:26:21,322 --> 01:26:23,413
I'm worried about you.
That's the DDT.

970
01:26:23,622 --> 01:26:24,553
-Hear me?
-He's dead!

971
01:26:24,756 --> 01:26:27,654
-He's paraIyzed, get out of the ring.
-You can't get out of the ring.

972
01:26:27,855 --> 01:26:29,412
He can. He has to get a chair.

973
01:26:29,622 --> 01:26:32,053
A chair?

974
01:26:35,422 --> 01:26:36,251
SIow motion.

975
01:26:41,489 --> 01:26:43,750
Trevor, when did you become
so vioIent?

976
01:26:44,422 --> 01:26:47,479
Take me to a match. You get
spIattered in the front row.

977
01:26:47,688 --> 01:26:48,949
I don't want to be spIattered.

978
01:26:49,155 --> 01:26:51,780
It'll be your
birthday present to me.

979
01:26:52,188 --> 01:26:55,382
You know what you're getting?
A new encycIopedia.

980
01:26:56,255 --> 01:26:57,221
Leather bound.

981
01:26:58,855 --> 01:27:01,685
Thucydides History of
the PeIoponnesian War.

982
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:04,513
No, I'm getting you 51
crackllng voIumes.

983
01:27:05,188 --> 01:27:09,086
There'll be pop quizzes every day on
the deveIopment of cotton farms.

984
01:27:09,288 --> 01:27:10,311
Hi, ArIene.

985
01:27:57,488 --> 01:27:59,113
You can't stay here, Ricky.

986
01:27:59,354 --> 01:28:00,547
I know.

987
01:28:01,688 --> 01:28:04,745
Look, I know what we had was
a nightmare, ArIene.

988
01:28:05,521 --> 01:28:08,043
-But I did it.
-You did what?

989
01:28:08,854 --> 01:28:12,082
I knew I couIdn't come back
unIess I was sober.

990
01:28:14,521 --> 01:28:16,043
It's the truth.

991
01:28:16,854 --> 01:28:21,048
Five months, two weeks and four days
are the truth.

992
01:28:22,521 --> 01:28:25,112
-Where you been?
-What does it matter?

993
01:28:25,354 --> 01:28:27,445
I knew I had to change.

994
01:28:28,354 --> 01:28:32,582
-Are you sober?
-Yeah, I got sober staying right here.

995
01:28:32,787 --> 01:28:34,515
Well, you're stronger than me.

996
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:36,709
Can you just stop for a minute?

997
01:28:37,254 --> 01:28:38,277
PIease?

998
01:28:38,521 --> 01:28:41,112
Can we just sit down and taIk?

999
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:01,508
God.

1000
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:03,379
I'm sorry.

1001
01:30:03,587 --> 01:30:04,745
What are you doing here?

1002
01:30:05,086 --> 01:30:08,779
-I want you to understand.
-No expIanation required.

1003
01:30:08,986 --> 01:30:11,316
PIease don't taIk to me llke that.

1004
01:30:11,953 --> 01:30:16,545
We had 13 years in, Eugene. He's sober
now. We've never been sober together.

1005
01:30:16,819 --> 01:30:17,750
I wish you Iuck.

1006
01:30:17,953 --> 01:30:21,044
I feeI llke I've got to
give him a chance.

1007
01:30:21,253 --> 01:30:23,718
A chance? A chance for what?

1008
01:30:24,387 --> 01:30:26,182
To change.

1009
01:30:26,387 --> 01:30:28,511
To try to make up for Iost time.

1010
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:32,083
To take Trevor to ball games?
Do ''daddy'' things with him?

1011
01:30:32,286 --> 01:30:34,774
Yeah, he promised to try.

1012
01:30:34,986 --> 01:30:36,952
-What shouId I do?
-Be smart.

1013
01:30:37,153 --> 01:30:38,584
He's his father.

1014
01:30:38,786 --> 01:30:40,376
He impregnated you, ArIene.

1015
01:30:40,586 --> 01:30:43,109
In what other way has he
been a father?

1016
01:30:43,319 --> 01:30:46,286
UnIess knocking somebody around
is a new famlly vaIue.

1017
01:30:46,486 --> 01:30:49,214
What do you mean?
He never touched Trevor.

1018
01:30:49,519 --> 01:30:51,678
Oh, that's right, onIy you.

1019
01:30:52,419 --> 01:30:55,874
He onIy took it out on you.
That's so much better.

1020
01:30:59,219 --> 01:31:00,742
What did Trevor tell you?

1021
01:31:00,953 --> 01:31:02,213
Enough.

1022
01:31:03,053 --> 01:31:06,780
Secrets llke that shouIdn't be kept.
What good does it do Trevor?

1023
01:31:06,986 --> 01:31:09,281
Ricky never meant to hit me.
We were drunk!

1024
01:31:09,486 --> 01:31:11,782
Christ!
What is it with women llke you?

1025
01:31:12,486 --> 01:31:15,452
Is that something you tell yourseIf?
''It's okay he beat me.''

1026
01:31:15,652 --> 01:31:16,845
''Trevor's okay.''

1027
01:31:17,052 --> 01:31:20,485
Trevor Iocked himseIf in a bathroom
and he can't breathe...

1028
01:31:20,686 --> 01:31:22,879
...and he's praying that it wllI stop!

1029
01:31:23,119 --> 01:31:26,483
-Trevor never went through that!
-You know what Trevor went through?

1030
01:31:26,853 --> 01:31:28,216
How do you know?

1031
01:31:28,452 --> 01:31:32,316
How do you know the next time after
you, he doesn't come for Trevor?

1032
01:31:32,552 --> 01:31:34,780
I know what I'm taIking about, ArIene.

1033
01:31:34,985 --> 01:31:38,815
My father got on his knees
and begged my mother...

1034
01:31:39,019 --> 01:31:42,144
...and my mother, she aIways
took him back.

1035
01:31:42,352 --> 01:31:43,511
I never understood it.

1036
01:31:43,718 --> 01:31:47,515
She'd cover the bruises and the cuts
and she'd take him back...

1037
01:31:48,419 --> 01:31:51,476
...because he begged and he cried.

1038
01:31:51,952 --> 01:31:54,180
Ask me what happened after
he came back.

1039
01:31:54,386 --> 01:31:57,284
You wanted to know what happened to me!
Now ask me!

1040
01:31:57,486 --> 01:32:00,713
-I don't llke this.
-''Did he hurt you?'' Ask!

1041
01:32:02,152 --> 01:32:03,345
Did he hurt you?

1042
01:32:04,386 --> 01:32:06,113
Not for Iong.

1043
01:32:06,319 --> 01:32:09,251
By 13 I was gone. I ran away.

1044
01:32:09,452 --> 01:32:13,384
But I missed her, so I had to go back
and see her.

1045
01:32:13,685 --> 01:32:15,514
So one night I did.

1046
01:32:16,651 --> 01:32:20,345
Ask what happened. ''What happened that
night you came back, Eugene?''

1047
01:32:20,551 --> 01:32:21,482
What happened?

1048
01:32:21,785 --> 01:32:24,580
He was there, drunk as usuaI.

1049
01:32:24,785 --> 01:32:26,648
OnIy this time, I wasn't the same.

1050
01:32:26,852 --> 01:32:31,148
I was 1 6 years oId and I was no Ionger
afraid of him.

1051
01:32:31,385 --> 01:32:33,045
And when I Iooked him in the eye...

1052
01:32:33,284 --> 01:32:38,182
...and toId him if he ever touched her
again, I wouId kllI him, he knew.

1053
01:32:38,485 --> 01:32:41,315
He knew that he wouId never exist
for me again.

1054
01:32:42,985 --> 01:32:45,008
And I'm standing in front of the house.

1055
01:32:45,218 --> 01:32:46,980
I'm screaming for her to come out.

1056
01:32:47,184 --> 01:32:50,150
I'm telling her she doesn't have
to take it anymore.

1057
01:32:50,351 --> 01:32:52,340
She doesn't.
She can come with me now.

1058
01:32:52,551 --> 01:32:53,539
I don't see it coming.

1059
01:32:53,785 --> 01:32:57,148
He hits my head with a two-by-four
and I'm bIeeding from my ear.

1060
01:32:57,351 --> 01:33:01,113
He's dragging me behind the house into
the garage. Then he's gone.

1061
01:33:01,318 --> 01:33:03,284
A minute, five minutes, I don't know.

1062
01:33:03,485 --> 01:33:07,440
Then he's back and wetting me down.
And I don't understand.

1063
01:33:07,651 --> 01:33:12,583
I don't understand why water
shouId smell so bad.

1064
01:33:13,284 --> 01:33:16,444
I don't understand. And then I see it.

1065
01:33:18,051 --> 01:33:19,540
I see...

1066
01:33:22,318 --> 01:33:23,477
...this...

1067
01:33:26,451 --> 01:33:28,212
...this gas can.

1068
01:33:29,518 --> 01:33:32,779
This red gas can from his truck.

1069
01:33:38,485 --> 01:33:41,349
And he Iooks at me one Iast time...

1070
01:33:43,318 --> 01:33:45,216
...and he llghts a match.

1071
01:33:49,617 --> 01:33:51,981
And the Iast thing I remember...

1072
01:33:52,617 --> 01:33:54,379
...and I'll never forget it...

1073
01:33:54,617 --> 01:33:56,140
...were his eyes.

1074
01:33:58,218 --> 01:34:01,184
His eyes, because they were
fllIed with this...

1075
01:34:03,118 --> 01:34:04,845
...immense...

1076
01:34:06,051 --> 01:34:07,949
...satisfaction.

1077
01:34:11,851 --> 01:34:12,839
I'm so sorry.

1078
01:34:13,118 --> 01:34:16,777
Don't tell me how sorry you
are for me!

1079
01:34:17,717 --> 01:34:20,013
Tell me how you'll stop it
happening to Trevor.

1080
01:34:20,217 --> 01:34:22,547
Ricky wouId never do that.

1081
01:34:22,951 --> 01:34:26,008
Oh, Jesus, ArIene. He doesn't have to.

1082
01:34:28,283 --> 01:34:30,442
All he has to do is not Iove him.

1083
01:35:47,716 --> 01:35:49,046
What's going on?

1084
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:51,977
What's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on.

1085
01:35:52,217 --> 01:35:54,206
-What are you doing?
-What's it Iook llke?

1086
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:55,279
You can't do this.

1087
01:35:55,483 --> 01:35:58,278
What are you putting in my room?
We had an agreement.

1088
01:35:59,616 --> 01:36:01,139
My son won't taIk to me.

1089
01:36:01,349 --> 01:36:04,213
He won't Iook at me!
You turn him against me?

1090
01:36:04,449 --> 01:36:07,347
I toId you I wasn't gonna make him
taIk to you.

1091
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:09,208
You couId get a job.

1092
01:36:09,449 --> 01:36:12,279
-What am I supposed to use for a car?
-Take the bus.

1093
01:36:12,483 --> 01:36:13,949
That'll be the day.

1094
01:36:14,616 --> 01:36:17,047
-You can't stay in this room.
-This is our room.

1095
01:36:17,249 --> 01:36:19,044
This is our house, our bed.

1096
01:36:19,282 --> 01:36:21,180
-You've been drinking.
-Kiss me.

1097
01:36:21,982 --> 01:36:25,937
Stop it! Stop it!
I want you out of this house.

1098
01:36:28,149 --> 01:36:30,707
-What's your probIem?
-I want you out.

1099
01:36:33,483 --> 01:36:36,040
Turn that down!
I'll come and pound your ass!

1100
01:36:36,249 --> 01:36:39,147
-Don't taIk to him llke that!
-Don't tell me how to taIk!

1101
01:36:39,349 --> 01:36:42,042
Don't tell me how to taIk to anybody.
I've had enough.

1102
01:36:42,249 --> 01:36:45,647
-Are you getting mad?
-What are you gonna do about it?

1103
01:36:46,416 --> 01:36:49,473
I llked you better when you had
a few drinks in you.

1104
01:36:50,882 --> 01:36:53,110
You want me out of the house, I'm out!

1105
01:36:53,316 --> 01:36:54,645
Sorry.

1106
01:37:00,316 --> 01:37:02,441
I think I made a mistake.

1107
01:37:07,949 --> 01:37:10,177
Everybody makes mistakes.

1108
01:38:11,348 --> 01:38:12,712
All right, bring them up.

1109
01:38:12,948 --> 01:38:15,278
Thank you. Carefully.

1110
01:38:15,482 --> 01:38:16,947
Thank you.

1111
01:38:17,615 --> 01:38:19,876
CarefuI. Did you get rid
of your hiccups?

1112
01:38:20,382 --> 01:38:22,939
ToId you hoIding your breath
wouId work.

1113
01:38:23,382 --> 01:38:26,280
Thank you. CarefuI. Thank you.

1114
01:38:29,115 --> 01:38:30,513
Very nice.

1115
01:38:31,015 --> 01:38:33,674
Give me that one. Thank you.

1116
01:38:34,981 --> 01:38:38,708
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1117
01:38:46,748 --> 01:38:48,214
Trevor, what is it?

1118
01:38:49,848 --> 01:38:51,780
Are you stllI gonna pay it forward?

1119
01:38:56,714 --> 01:38:58,680
You couId say you don't have to...

1120
01:39:00,647 --> 01:39:02,374
...because it didn't work out.

1121
01:39:05,015 --> 01:39:06,913
But I thought you stllI might.

1122
01:39:13,748 --> 01:39:17,703
Trevor, I wouId llke more than
anything to do that for you.

1123
01:39:19,347 --> 01:39:23,007
-When I find something worthy--
-I know somebody who needs something.

1124
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:27,442
-You have to Iet me find this--
-You know who it is.

1125
01:39:30,081 --> 01:39:31,171
Look...

1126
01:39:32,347 --> 01:39:35,836
...you don't understand everything.
All right?

1127
01:39:36,047 --> 01:39:38,377
So you do not know what you're asking.

1128
01:39:38,581 --> 01:39:40,843
Give her another chance.

1129
01:39:44,247 --> 01:39:47,372
I wllI pay it forward.
I promise you that.

1130
01:39:49,014 --> 01:39:50,946
But I cannot do that.

1131
01:40:04,847 --> 01:40:07,109
But that's why this is the one.

1132
01:40:08,681 --> 01:40:11,340
Because it's supposed to be
something hard.

1133
01:40:14,913 --> 01:40:18,743
If you heIp my mom, even if you're
stllI mad, in a way nobody couId--

1134
01:40:18,947 --> 01:40:22,402
-Did she ask you to taIk to me?
-No, she thinks you won't forgive her.

1135
01:40:22,613 --> 01:40:24,546
But I stllI think you couId.

1136
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:29,568
If you wanted to do something huge...

1137
01:40:33,347 --> 01:40:34,812
...for someone...

1138
01:40:36,347 --> 01:40:37,937
...for my project.

1139
01:40:42,513 --> 01:40:43,877
For me.

1140
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:51,607
She made her choice.

1141
01:40:51,813 --> 01:40:53,335
She said she made a mistake.

1142
01:40:53,546 --> 01:40:55,705
Well, that's the beauty of hindsight.

1143
01:41:13,646 --> 01:41:14,976
You don't care.

1144
01:41:17,513 --> 01:41:19,069
Yes, I do.

1145
01:41:20,246 --> 01:41:24,440
I wllI aIways care about you, aIways.

1146
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:29,140
Yeah.

1147
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:32,270
You're my teacher.

1148
01:41:33,413 --> 01:41:35,140
They pay you to.

1149
01:42:23,412 --> 01:42:25,878
-You got it?
-Yeah.

1150
01:42:30,046 --> 01:42:32,568
I ain't saying a thing tllI I
get one more.

1151
01:42:32,779 --> 01:42:36,370
You know, I thought you might
feeI that way.

1152
01:42:41,079 --> 01:42:42,874
No, no. Later.

1153
01:42:51,912 --> 01:42:53,878
I got my pIaces.

1154
01:42:54,579 --> 01:42:59,511
PIaces where nobody cares where
you park overnight.

1155
01:43:01,946 --> 01:43:04,173
Places where I live.

1156
01:43:05,545 --> 01:43:07,534
Anybody who knows me...

1157
01:43:07,746 --> 01:43:10,712
...knows where to fllnd me.

1158
01:43:23,345 --> 01:43:24,572
Hi, Mom.

1159
01:43:27,045 --> 01:43:30,569
-What are you doing here?
-I wanted to see you.

1160
01:43:32,612 --> 01:43:37,340
-After three years, why now?
-I can't watch you do this.

1161
01:43:41,145 --> 01:43:42,441
I drive by your house.

1162
01:43:42,644 --> 01:43:44,042
I know.

1163
01:43:46,045 --> 01:43:48,136
-He's big.
-Yeah.

1164
01:43:51,278 --> 01:43:52,937
What are you doing here?

1165
01:43:54,379 --> 01:43:57,004
Are you gonna try to put me
somewhere?

1166
01:43:57,212 --> 01:43:58,507
No.

1167
01:43:59,544 --> 01:44:01,272
Then what do you want?

1168
01:44:02,379 --> 01:44:05,776
I want to try to do something.

1169
01:44:10,112 --> 01:44:11,941
All the things...

1170
01:44:13,145 --> 01:44:14,974
...when I was a kid.

1171
01:44:16,811 --> 01:44:19,436
The booze...

1172
01:44:20,378 --> 01:44:21,935
...and the men.

1173
01:44:24,277 --> 01:44:26,766
What happened to me when you
weren't Iooking.

1174
01:44:31,045 --> 01:44:33,011
I know we're all weak.

1175
01:44:33,778 --> 01:44:37,767
-No, not you.
-No, I've been weak.

1176
01:44:41,678 --> 01:44:43,143
Here's the thing.

1177
01:44:47,644 --> 01:44:49,337
I forgive you.

1178
01:45:25,111 --> 01:45:28,305
-I don't llke your hair.
-I know. I'm not putting it back.

1179
01:45:33,177 --> 01:45:37,166
So I'd llke to see you sometimes.
Is that okay?

1180
01:45:39,944 --> 01:45:41,205
Yes.

1181
01:45:43,111 --> 01:45:44,236
You can't llve with me.

1182
01:45:47,944 --> 01:45:49,603
Who wouId want to?

1183
01:45:52,144 --> 01:45:53,507
Can I see him?

1184
01:45:54,777 --> 01:45:56,243
Not drunk.

1185
01:45:56,443 --> 01:45:58,909
You've got to be sober if just
for two hours.

1186
01:45:59,111 --> 01:46:00,940
Yeah, I can do that.

1187
01:46:01,276 --> 01:46:02,537
Okay.

1188
01:46:06,343 --> 01:46:08,105
Then I'll come and find you.

1189
01:46:08,310 --> 01:46:09,503
Okay?

1190
01:46:10,610 --> 01:46:11,871
Yeah.

1191
01:46:13,011 --> 01:46:14,135
Okay.

1192
01:46:15,044 --> 01:46:17,168
Why'd you do this, ArIey?

1193
01:46:23,276 --> 01:46:24,936
She told me why.

1194
01:46:26,877 --> 01:46:30,365
She toId me I had to do
something big...

1195
01:46:31,677 --> 01:46:33,006
...for three other peopIe.

1196
01:46:33,210 --> 01:46:36,699
Happy birthday dear Trevor

1197
01:46:37,043 --> 01:46:40,941
Happy birthday to you

1198
01:46:41,143 --> 01:46:43,938
And many more

1199
01:46:56,343 --> 01:46:58,275
What'd you wish for?

1200
01:46:58,477 --> 01:47:00,942
He can't tell you or it
won't come true.

1201
01:47:01,143 --> 01:47:02,302
Can I have some napkins?

1202
01:47:02,510 --> 01:47:03,498
Here you go.

1203
01:47:09,343 --> 01:47:10,468
I'll get it.

1204
01:47:16,676 --> 01:47:17,835
Mom?

1205
01:47:20,043 --> 01:47:24,135
I'm Chris ChandIer. I'm a reporter.
CouId I have a moment of your time?

1206
01:47:24,343 --> 01:47:27,241
Why? I don't have anything to
say about anything.

1207
01:47:27,476 --> 01:47:31,875
PIease. I've aIready spoken to your
mother, which naturally Ied me to you.

1208
01:47:32,076 --> 01:47:34,633
-My mother?
-She toId me about pay it forward.

1209
01:47:34,843 --> 01:47:37,036
How you heIped her.
I'm doing a story.

1210
01:47:37,243 --> 01:47:38,868
You can't. That's private.

1211
01:47:39,576 --> 01:47:43,406
It upset my son. It was a sociaI
studies thing and it didn't work.

1212
01:47:43,642 --> 01:47:45,165
SociaI studies?

1213
01:47:45,376 --> 01:47:48,365
Leave it aIone. He just wants
to get on with seventh grade.

1214
01:47:48,576 --> 01:47:50,804
It's his birthday and it's a bad time.

1215
01:47:51,010 --> 01:47:53,407
-I'm sorry--
-No, I'm sorry.

1216
01:47:53,642 --> 01:47:56,369
I've been tracking this story
from Los AngeIes.

1217
01:47:56,576 --> 01:47:58,940
Pay it Forward, the movement,
reached L.A.

1218
01:47:59,142 --> 01:48:01,370
-Come on. The movement?
-Yeah.

1219
01:48:01,576 --> 01:48:04,508
Your son had something to do
with this?

1220
01:48:16,908 --> 01:48:18,772
I really appreciate this,
Mrs. McIKinney.

1221
01:48:18,975 --> 01:48:20,271
It's up to him.

1222
01:48:21,842 --> 01:48:24,400
-Ready, sIugger?
-I guess.

1223
01:48:24,642 --> 01:48:26,437
Here you go. Up here, pIease.

1224
01:48:26,642 --> 01:48:28,608
Just llke you're getting a haircut.

1225
01:48:29,342 --> 01:48:31,672
-You been interviewed before?
-No.

1226
01:48:34,576 --> 01:48:35,905
This is for you.

1227
01:48:36,109 --> 01:48:37,097
Hi. How are you?

1228
01:48:37,309 --> 01:48:40,797
-What's your name?
-Chris ChandIer. Nice to meet you.

1229
01:48:41,009 --> 01:48:44,339
Less painfuI than the dentist.
Just be yourseIf, okay?

1230
01:48:44,576 --> 01:48:46,235
-Ready to go?
-I guess.

1231
01:48:46,442 --> 01:48:49,101
Come on, you got to have
some gusto here.

1232
01:48:49,309 --> 01:48:51,638
All right, Iet's go.
All right, great.

1233
01:48:52,075 --> 01:48:55,768
Just be yourseIf. ReIax.
It's gonna be a Iot of fun.

1234
01:49:02,009 --> 01:49:03,599
Okay, we're on?

1235
01:49:05,175 --> 01:49:09,800
Hi, I'm Chris ChandIer and I'm joined
today by an unusuaI seventh grader...

1236
01:49:10,009 --> 01:49:11,565
...Trevor McIKinney.

1237
01:49:12,075 --> 01:49:14,064
Trevor, you must be pretty proud of
yourseIf.

1238
01:49:14,275 --> 01:49:15,399
No.

1239
01:49:17,075 --> 01:49:18,768
So you're not proud at all?

1240
01:49:20,575 --> 01:49:22,564
I don't know. I guess.

1241
01:49:22,775 --> 01:49:27,003
Come on, you start a movement llke Pay
it Forward. You're not proud?

1242
01:49:27,608 --> 01:49:32,007
I guess. I mean, I got an ''A''
in sociaI studies.

1243
01:49:32,241 --> 01:49:34,764
But that was just for the effort.

1244
01:49:35,141 --> 01:49:37,005
Stuff I did, it didn't work out.

1245
01:49:38,241 --> 01:49:40,639
-You're here.
-Yeah, but--

1246
01:49:41,341 --> 01:49:43,807
I don't know. I tried reaI hard...

1247
01:49:44,842 --> 01:49:46,467
...but nothing really happened.

1248
01:49:47,308 --> 01:49:49,069
My mom's stuff worked.

1249
01:49:49,274 --> 01:49:52,399
She taIked to my grandma.
IKind of made up with her.

1250
01:49:52,775 --> 01:49:54,570
It was really hard for her.

1251
01:49:55,141 --> 01:49:58,835
It was great for me, because my
grandma came to my birthday party.

1252
01:50:00,842 --> 01:50:02,467
And I had really missed her.

1253
01:50:04,841 --> 01:50:07,501
And that's why Pay it Forward went to
all those pIaces...

1254
01:50:08,174 --> 01:50:09,367
...because of my mom.

1255
01:50:10,508 --> 01:50:13,065
Because she was so brave.

1256
01:50:13,675 --> 01:50:19,005
My stuff, I don't know. I think some
peopIe are too scared or something...

1257
01:50:19,441 --> 01:50:21,668
...to think things can be different.

1258
01:50:26,108 --> 01:50:27,971
The worId's not exactIy...

1259
01:50:29,375 --> 01:50:30,363
...shit.

1260
01:50:33,441 --> 01:50:38,396
I guess it's hard for some peopIe who
are used to things the way they are...

1261
01:50:38,607 --> 01:50:40,233
...even if they're bad...

1262
01:50:41,607 --> 01:50:43,005
...to change.

1263
01:50:44,807 --> 01:50:46,500
And they kind of give up.

1264
01:50:51,507 --> 01:50:53,598
When they do, everybody--

1265
01:50:55,574 --> 01:50:57,097
They kind of Iose.

1266
01:51:24,974 --> 01:51:26,132
Hi, ArIene.

1267
01:51:29,273 --> 01:51:32,433
I don't want to be one of those peopIe
he's taIking about.

1268
01:51:33,173 --> 01:51:34,901
And I've become one.

1269
01:51:37,741 --> 01:51:40,434
I don't want to spend another
second of wasted air.

1270
01:51:44,073 --> 01:51:46,733
PIease don't Iet me stay trapped
in here forever.

1271
01:51:46,940 --> 01:51:48,167
I won't.

1272
01:51:48,374 --> 01:51:51,067
I don't want to spend another second
without you.

1273
01:52:04,374 --> 01:52:05,362
See you around.

1274
01:52:05,574 --> 01:52:07,335
All right, see you Iater, guys.

1275
01:52:10,773 --> 01:52:11,761
Let me go!

1276
01:52:11,973 --> 01:52:13,598
-Stop it!
-Who'd you tell?

1277
01:52:15,073 --> 01:52:18,096
-Who'd you tell, tattIetaIe?
-I didn't tell anybody.

1278
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:23,133
I didn't say anything.

1279
01:52:23,340 --> 01:52:24,397
HeIp!

1280
01:52:28,606 --> 01:52:31,095
Stop it! Trevor!

1281
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,033
Come here.

1282
01:52:41,107 --> 01:52:42,095
Let me go!

1283
01:52:42,539 --> 01:52:44,368
Cut it out! No!

1284
01:52:46,973 --> 01:52:48,199
Get out of my face!

1285
01:52:48,406 --> 01:52:49,997
Punch him! Come on!

1286
01:52:50,606 --> 01:52:51,572
No!

1287
01:52:52,873 --> 01:52:53,804
Leave him aIone!

1288
01:53:16,139 --> 01:53:18,071
Someone get an ambuIance!

1289
01:54:13,339 --> 01:54:15,998
I guess it's hard for
some people who...

1290
01:54:16,206 --> 01:54:18,671
...are used to things
the way they are.

1291
01:54:18,872 --> 01:54:20,735
...even if they're bad...

1292
01:54:20,939 --> 01:54:22,200
...to change.

1293
01:54:25,705 --> 01:54:27,364
I guess they kind ofgive up...

1294
01:54:29,705 --> 01:54:31,171
...and when they do...

1295
01:54:32,538 --> 01:54:36,027
...everybody kind ofloses.

1296
01:54:36,905 --> 01:54:39,735
These moments make you sorry
to report anything.

1297
01:54:39,939 --> 01:54:43,393
This remarkable young man died
at 7:35 this evening.

1298
01:54:43,605 --> 01:54:48,435
There are now confllrmed incidents of
Pay it Forward in L.A., San Francisco.

1299
01:54:48,672 --> 01:54:50,194
In Phoenix, we're checking...

1300
01:54:50,405 --> 01:54:53,235
...if the 16 foster children who
received computers...

1301
01:54:53,438 --> 01:54:55,927
...is connected to this movement.

1302
01:54:56,171 --> 01:54:57,432
It's hard.

1303
01:54:57,672 --> 01:54:59,194
You can'tplan it.

1304
01:55:00,505 --> 01:55:03,528
You have to watch people more.

1305
01:55:05,438 --> 01:55:08,870
Sort ofkeep an eye on them
to protect them...

1306
01:55:11,205 --> 01:55:13,694
...because they can't always
see what they need.

1307
01:55:17,871 --> 01:55:22,099
It's like your big chance to fllx
something that's not like your bike.

1308
01:55:30,105 --> 01:55:32,196
You can fllx a person.

1309
01:55:32,405 --> 01:55:35,893
Is that what you want for your
birthday, everybody to pay it forward?

1310
01:55:36,271 --> 01:55:37,362
I can't ask for that.

1311
01:55:37,571 --> 01:55:41,004
-Sure you can. Why not?
-Wouldn't work.

1312
01:55:41,205 --> 01:55:42,500
Why?

1313
01:55:49,904 --> 01:55:52,097
I already blew out my candles.
