1
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:34,633
- Let's go.
- Whoo!

2
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,735
Have a
        good ride, guys.
        I feel for you.

3
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:50,582
             Water?

4
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,089
    Come on, beauty queens.

5
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,192
            Come on.

6
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,607
             Amos.

7
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,510
            A-M-O-S.

8
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,815
            Jenkins.

9
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:26,085
         J-E-N-K-I-N-S.

10
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:31,590
Do you have
   a personal representative
    present with you today?

11
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:33,625
No.

12
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:40,499
       Now, Mr. Jenkins,
     we'd like to thank you
    for going on the record.

13
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,434
        Your testimony,
      as you can imagine,

14
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,603
        is of the utmost
       importance to us,

15
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,372
     since you're the only
   survivor of the accident.

16
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,410
      So if you could just
      begin by telling us,

17
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:53,178
         best you can,

18
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,114
  what happened that morning.

19
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,684
        Do you remember
         leaving home?

20
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,423
    Well, it was, you know,
    just like any other day.

21
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:10,395
  I don't remember if we even
   started working, you know,

22
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,232
      before it happened.

23
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,868
       Well, how did you
          get to work?

24
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,404
           My truck.

25
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:22,141
        What was it like
     outside that morning?

26
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,409
        Was it raining,
           or stormy?

27
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,783
        Was it raining?

28
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:36,355
       I don't remember.

29
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,557
      Was there lightning?

30
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,828
          I can't say.

31
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,566
    Did your cap lamp work?

32
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,905
         It was working
       as far as I know.

33
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,477
      But then it went out
   like the rest of them did.

34
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,471
          What are you
       doing over there?

35
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,407
         Get away from
         that old mine!

36
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,347
         You don't know
         how deep those
          things are.

37
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,383
         Remember what
           Dad said?

38
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:51,556
        There are snakes
     and chiggers in there,
     you better watch out.

39
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,837
             -Hey.
       -Nice headphones.
        Let me see that.

40
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,840
         -This an MP3?
             -Yeah.

41
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,410
         -That's cool.
      -Look, it's even got
     a little camera on it.

42
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:16,848
 -I gave you everything I got.
         -Dude, we need
       three more bucks.

43
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,884
     I got like two bucks,
        give me a beer.

44
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:20,819
     What's in this wallet
         of yours, huh?
          -Hey, wait.

45
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,387
            Come on.
         Give it back.
       -Let me see this.

46
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,323
      You should have wads
        of cash in here.

47
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,724
  You hit the fucking jackpot.

48
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,592
       What do you mean?

49
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:31,396
          My dad said.
     You're gonna be rich.

50
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:36,335
        Hey, over here,
            come on.
    Dude, you better not...

51
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:37,769
- Whoa!
- Oh, shit!

52
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:41,406
    Mr. Jenkins, can we have
    a word on your recovery?

53
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:44,076
       No, it's not okay,
         it ain't okay.

54
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:45,477
    Get back out of the way.

55
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,979
    Get back out of the way.
         You all right?

56
00:05:56,556 --> 00:06:00,425
Hey, kid, it is good
    to see you again, buddy.

57
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,527
           Hey, Carl,
        nice to see you.

58
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,731
      Wow, it's a miracle,
       that's what it is.

59
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:11,436
     Hey, folks, how about
      a round of applause
  for Amos Jenkins here, huh?

60
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,851
      I heard that you was
      having some problems

61
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:28,754
       remembering stuff
    in the interview there.

62
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:32,491
        Yeah, you know,
  things get a little blurry.

63
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:34,993
     Don't let us down now.

64
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,529
     There's lots of folks
        counting on you.

65
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,099
          Ten men got
      crushed down there.

66
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,402
       Yeah, I don't need
      no reminding, Carl.

67
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,505
        Why are you boys
        interfering with
           my lunch?

68
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:49,408
    Basil, don't be a scab.
      You've been a miner
        your whole life.

69
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,809
          Easy, Carl.

70
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,911
           I ain't on
         no side here.

71
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,880
    Don't be underestimating
    the position you're in.

72
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:57,549
            Nobody's
   underestimating anything.

73
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:04,055
  That's the guy representing
      the other families.

74
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:09,094
      Hey, I'm just trying
   to take care of everyone.

75
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,897
     You're a victim, too,
           you know.

76
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,102
      Will you just let me
         do the talking
      with the union guys?

77
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:18,837
        They're a bunch
          of vultures.

78
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,540
      Every time something
    bad happens they just...

79
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,009
      Circle the carcass.

80
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,078
        I don't need you
    meddling in my business.

81
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:28,914
           Well, if I
        ain't meddling,

82
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,450
       everybody else is
       gonna be meddling,

83
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:34,119
   because everybody's gonna
   be wanting a piece of you.

84
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,927
           Hey, baby.
          What did you
          do all day?

85
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,864
You still
      playing those games?

86
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,467
     How many damn gunshots
     do I gotta listen to?

87
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,904
        Hey, sweetheart!
              -Hi.

88
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:56,808
         Let me see all
        these new games,
       you spoiled brat.

89
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,212
       Quit messing with
     my shit, Aunt Nellie.

90
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:01,480
Mom!

91
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,616
        Give me a kiss.

92
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,052
           Thank you.

93
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,661
         You should buy
         something nice
         for yourself.

94
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,163
        They don't need
       more stupid toys.

95
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:25,036
       Well, buying them
     new video games ain't
    gonna bring Junior back.

96
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,108
         Amos is back,
           you know.

97
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,646
         I don't know.
      It's probably gonna
         weird me out.

98
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,217
        He looked good,
   better than everyone said.

99
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,730
    You already break that?

100
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,298
        No, I'll fix it.

101
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,134
     It fell on the ground.

102
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,739
        Are we rich now?

103
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:04,876
       You see all those
      bills on the table?
    Why are you asking that?

104
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:08,046
     Well, because of Dad.
       Are we richer now?

105
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:16,021
      Well, sure. I mean,
  there's a little extra money
    that they gave everyone.

106
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:18,823
       I mean, that's why
     you got us this thing
         and the Xbox?

107
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,759
        Why? Did someone
     say something to you?

108
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,828
  No. They were just all like,
       "Oh, that's new."

109
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:28,800
        Just ignore it,
       there are so many
   trashy kids in this town.

110
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,205
    How long you gotta leave
    that crap in your hair?

111
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,675
  This crap? You want some of
  this crap in your hair, huh?

112
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,176
              -No.
           -Come on,
        get out of here.

113
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,811
          Go put your
        brother to bed.
             -Okay.

114
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,631
        For what we are
       about to receive,

115
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,766
          let us truly
       be grateful. Amen.

116
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,335
             Amen.

117
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,942
           How's that
           right arm?

118
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,777
      Oh, it's all right.

119
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,247
          Left side's
        perfect, though.

120
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,918
      I think I can start
     driving on my own now.

121
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,853
     I ain't stopping you.

122
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,891
         I was thinking
     I'd call that lawyer,

123
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,761
         that the union
        folks suggested.

124
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,966
         These lawyers,
      they'll trip you up,
    if you don't watch them.

125
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,969
          Make you say
      all sorts of stuff.

126
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:42,273
        They ain't gonna
     put words in my mouth.

127
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,909
        Are you so sure?

128
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,145
         And then what?

129
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:52,684
          You gonna be
          the big shot
        that closes down

130
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,919
   the Bonford Coal Company?

131
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,323
     We lost men in there.

132
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,260
      I'd keep to myself,
         if I was you.

133
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,730
     Just keep telling them
      you don't remember.

134
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,969
    Try to get back to work,
   back to being productive.

135
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,208
       How many notebooks
     do you think you need?

136
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,177
             Five.

137
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,313
       And you need pens
    and stuff too, probably?

138
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,318
              Yes?
      -Yeah, that's fine.

139
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,756
          Where's Dad?

140
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:34,859
    Dad? He's in Pittsburgh.
          Doing what?

141
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,362
       He left Wednesday.
      The coal convention.

142
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,101
          Is that me?

143
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,976
Stupid car.

144
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,181
             Fuck.
          -Oh, my God.

145
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,349
         Shit. Who the
         hell did that?

146
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,985
         Okay. Come on,
     let's get back inside.

147
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,354
   Come on, come on, come on.
      It's just some punk.

148
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,263
      Are they mad at Dad?
             What?

149
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,366
      Because of the mine?

150
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:18,737
     or that was just some
      dumb prank, or what.

151
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,206
          Yeah, well,
         online, people
        are mad at him.

152
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,874
          Please stop
      reading that stuff.

153
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,476
       I don't understand
        the half of it.

154
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:27,412
          Now I gotta
        get that fucking
        thing replaced.

155
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,754
           It's fine.

156
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,428
Hey,
   Mom will be back at nine.

157
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,963
          She went to
       the union meeting.

158
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,966
       I'm going out for
    a little bit, all right?

159
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,083
          I wanna go.

160
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:09,320
       No, you stay here.
     Keep your butt on that
   couch, and watch your TV.

161
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,324
          Don't move.

162
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,382
   Why are you following me?

163
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,918
          Go on back,
       I'll be home soon.

164
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,187
            Go back,
      before I smack you.

165
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,394
            Go home.

166
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,896
- Light it.
- There's one left.

167
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,031
            No. No.

168
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,365
        Like, swing it.

169
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,100
             Whoa!

170
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,405
No.

171
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,273
        That's some nice
       stuff right there.

172
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,621
What's that?
           Fireworks.

173
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,498
          Stay there.

174
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,221
           Hey, guys.

175
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,389
Nice.

176
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:56,027
       Good going, dude.
   Give me one of those, man.

177
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,428
         You ever heard
     of a six-pack before?

178
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,063
Man, that smells.

179
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,299
These smoke
        balls are lames.

180
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,102
   Shit, there ain't nothing
  to do in this fucking town.

181
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:07,238
        Get out of this
       fucking shithole,
    take the first damn bus.

182
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,606
I bet you've
      never been on a bus.

183
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,309
       No, he only rides
         in fancy cars.
        -Shut up, Kenny.

184
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,412
       Next dig, come on!

185
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,319
       Does your brother
     know to like do shit,
      like read and write?

186
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,154
     He can read a little.

187
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:31,229
    Do you think he's gonna
    be able like fuck girls,
  and get a driver's license?

188
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:38,069
That would suck
       if he has to live
     with your mom forever.

189
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,305
      JT, you might never
   get your driver's license.

190
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,042
     Hey, it's almost 7:00.
      Katie said we could
      all come over, so...

191
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,010
     Oh, I want to see her.
             -Yup.

192
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:49,981
Let's go.

193
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,249
     Dude, I just got here.
            Come on.

194
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,084
        Oh, yeah, we'll
         miss you, man.
             -Aww.

195
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,252
           Group hug!

196
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,256
          Oh, my God!

197
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,657
         You guys like
      to act like faggots?

198
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,060
        Ooh, girlfriend,
        you got a saucy
         mouth on you!

199
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,530
       Come on, come on.

200
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,302
            Wait up!
     -Dude, you better not.

201
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,340
Come on.

202
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,081
        Come on, James.
         Let's go home.

203
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,223
     Why you walking funny?
         You gotta pee?

204
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,491
          I think so.

205
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,393
       You can't hold it?

206
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,662
       Come on, this way.

207
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,666
           Hurry up.

208
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:44,635
            Come on.

209
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,340
          Go back here
         to this tree.

210
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,083
            Go pee.

211
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,103
      You and your retard
    brother are still here?

212
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,439
       You're an asshole.

213
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,741
    Why don't you speak up?
       I didn't hear you.

214
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,514
        I hope your dad
          goes to jail
     for killing 10 miners.

215
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:31,382
        What'd you say?

216
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,117
     Hope he rots in there
        for what he did.

217
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,519
       My dad had nothing
        to do with that.

218
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:39,323
 You're fucking trailer trash,
         and you people
    are fucking milking it.

219
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,748
              Hey!

220
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,517
I'm gonna beat
     your fuckin' head in!

221
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,103
              Oh!

222
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,246
              JT?

223
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,250
              JT?

224
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,234
              JT?

225
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,548
             James?

226
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,452
             James?

227
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:24,295
             James?

228
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,401
          Don't watch.

229
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,618
      What are you doing?
          Stay there.

230
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,686
          Don't move.

231
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,567
      If you tell anybody,
    I'm gonna be mad, okay?

232
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,635
             -Okay.
        -Okay, come on.

233
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,674
            Come on.

234
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,645
            Come on,
     we gotta go, come on.

235
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,515
        James, come on,
          we gotta go.

236
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:54,719
            Come on.

237
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,764
<i> Hello.</i>

238
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:16,434
        Hey, Sandy, hi,
           I'm trying
       to track down JT.

239
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:18,402
         Were they all
       going to Katie's?

240
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:19,704
       <i> Isn't he home yet?</i>

241
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:22,039
         Yeah, he's...
           He's not.
             <i> -No?</i>

242
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,542
     No, I called his phone
        a million times.

243
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,744
            Oh, no.

244
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:27,878
             Yeah.

245
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,349
            Oh, no.
     I'm sure it's nothing.

246
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,451
           All right.

247
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:35,820
         Yeah, I will.
       I'll let you know.
        All right. Bye.

248
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,865
       <i> Hi, this is Bill,</i>
    <i> please leave a message.</i>

249
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,000
      Bill, please call me
       when you get this.

250
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,443
  Go on and brush your teeth,
       James, it's 9:00.

251
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,115
         What's wrong?
        I want dessert.

252
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,551
        You can have an
      ice cream sandwich,
         and that's it.

253
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,488
     and get ready for bed,
       all right, buddy?

254
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:12,957
         You want some?

255
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,660
      No, I'm not hungry.

256
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,398
          Here you go.

257
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,501
         You guys gotta
      get back to going to
     bed at a decent hour.

258
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:25,736
      It's gonna be a rude
      awakening on Monday.

259
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:41,886
You better be good.

260
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,616
Now, we're gonna
     need your okay to get
 the word out to the community.

261
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:21,719
  And we still have the phone
      going to voice mail?

262
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:23,721
         Yeah, he's not
          picking up.

263
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:26,590
        Now, Mrs. Doyle,
     you answered a number
    of questions last night,

264
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:29,827
      but I'd like to fill
    a few holes for myself,
        so bear with me.

265
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,630
          Does JT have
        lots of friends?

266
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:34,532
           Yeah, he's
       a very social kid.

267
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:37,001
         He's got lots
         of activities,
      football, baseball.

268
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:38,836
           Baseball.
            Mmm-hmm.

269
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:41,305
         Would you say
       he's a happy kid?
       Yeah, I'd say so.

270
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,745
          He was real
      frazzled yesterday,

271
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:49,847
       you know, someone
      broke my windshield.

272
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,181
I'm sorry?

273
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:55,786
       Yesterday morning,
      somebody smashed up
         my windshield.

274
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:01,725
Well, would anyone
  be trying to hurt the family
       for a work reason,

275
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,061
     something in response
        to the accident?

276
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,597
Well, I can't even
         imagine that.

277
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:10,801
Do you have
     a sense of the miners
       that work for you?

278
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:14,905
          Any of them
       strange, violent,
       resentful of you?

279
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:18,309
      Have they expressed
          any threats?
            -No. No.

280
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:22,980
           Excuse me.

281
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:32,256
       She doesn't wanna
     think that this could
       involve foul play.

282
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,061
     Can't it be that we're
      just making a bigger
       deal out of this,

283
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:38,696
         that he's just
          goofing off,

284
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:40,598
         you know, with
        a friend of his?

285
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:38,155
         Was there any
         joking around
         in the woods,

286
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,657
       like, being rowdy?

287
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:44,094
       Just normal stuff.
       Talking, laughing.

288
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,063
       Anybody fighting?

289
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,299
    No, just goofing around.

290
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,741
      The other boys said
     that you brought beer.

291
00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:58,809
             Yeah.

292
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:02,846
         No, there was
       some whiskey, too.

293
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,184
       So after the guys
       left, did you ever
        see JT come back

294
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,819
      down that main path?

295
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:12,723
              No.

296
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:17,261
      But the boys told me
    that he went back to get
     the bottle of whiskey.

297
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,330
        So you must have
        seen him, right?

298
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:25,335
       I didn't see him.
  I guess I was already gone.

299
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,743
       Is there something
          that you're
        not telling me?

300
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,946
            No, sir.

301
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,769
Everybody,
    let's welcome Amos back.

302
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:00,804
Thank you very much.

303
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:03,340
We have a
    little surprise for you.

304
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:04,908
              No.

305
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,427
        You should take
        what's leftover.

306
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:24,795
              -Oh!
             -Yeah.

307
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,466
           Thank you.
          My dad might
         appreciate it.

308
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,971
       How you been doing
     these past few months?

309
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,274
           All right.

310
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,942
       Things got pretty
       ugly around here.

311
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,478
           It's good
         you missed it.

312
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,180
             Yeah.

313
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:48,018
       Well, if you ever
         need anything,

314
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,822
        or you wanna see
       a movie sometime,
       just let me know.

315
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:57,327
    I can't do that anymore.
  I can hardly move and stuff.

316
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,062
        I didn't mean it
           like that.

317
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,333
         I guess I just
       don't feel like my
      old self yet, Nell.

318
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:09,306
       Well, I guess it's
     gonna take some time.

319
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,509
     Nice seeing you, Amos.

320
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:21,084
     So you're saying that
    you never saw Bill Doyle

321
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:24,321
    or any other individual
     in management disable
           a monitor?

322
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,592
         Please answer
         the question.

323
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,495
           I say no.

324
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,265
      I never saw nothing
     regarding the monitor.

325
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,534
             Okay.

326
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:41,004
     Well, I'd like to ask
    you now about the issue
         of coal dust.

327
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,141
        Do you remember
         hearing about
      an incident in which

328
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:46,376
         Junior Briggs
        had an argument
        with Bill Doyle?

329
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,046
       Junior warned him
       he personally felt

330
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:50,914
      uncomfortable going
          in the mines

331
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:52,950
    with that level of dust.

332
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,522
   Can't say I remember that.

333
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:02,492
      Now, do you remember
    hearing a story in which

334
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:05,162
  Bill Doyle then reprimanded
      or threatened Junior

335
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:07,865
   for warning other workers
      about the coal dust?

336
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,405
        My memory's bad
        with this stuff.

337
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:20,377
      Well, if we gave you
         a little time,

338
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:24,147
   do you think you could try
   to recall any facts about
     the alleged incident,

339
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:25,883
     one way or the other?

340
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,484
             Yeah.

341
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,387
       Yeah, I could try,

342
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,422
   but I can't guarantee it.

343
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,615
     I wouldn't be too hard
    on myself, if I was you.

344
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:02,019
   I never could make a fuss.
   I had a family to support.

345
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,056
        All you got was
      a bump on the head.

346
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:07,591
     Don't be comparing us.

347
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,566
         What is that?

348
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,303
      I got that when you
      was in the hospital.

349
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,406
       It goes real good
     with them cigarettes.

350
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,480
        What's going on
           out there?

351
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:35,319
      Ah, they're looking
      for that Doyle boy.

352
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,530
   I'm gonna get me some air.

353
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,583
         You don't have
        to give speeches
      and thank everybody.

354
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:08,552
    The police can do that.

355
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,321
           The police
       have a job to do.

356
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,492
     I just don't think you
    need to play boss today.

357
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,062
      Diana, I just don't
        know what to do.

358
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:21,531
        I feel like I'm
     in a foreign country.

359
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,038
          Who's that?

360
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,353
             Amos?

361
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,390
          Bill Doyle.
             Bill.

362
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,093
       Thank you so much
      for coming out here.

363
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,295
         It sure means
          a lot to me.

364
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:55,298
     Well, I'd like to help
     you out any way I can.

365
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,435
       Real sorry to hear
      about this for you.

366
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:05,242
   I bet you got journalists
     and newspapers chasing
      after you now, huh?

367
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:06,443
         You're a real
           hero here.

368
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,713
         Well, I don't
        know about that.

369
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:14,551
         Well, anyways,
      it's good to see you
       on your two feet.

370
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,387
        Slow and steady
         with that cane
         now, you hear?

371
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,655
           Yes, sir.

372
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,492
           Bill, I...
        I was thinking.

373
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,829
     If you need anything,
      we run a Bible study

374
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:28,198
         at the church
         every Tuesday.

375
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:32,169
      I don't count on God
      for much these days,

376
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,638
          if you know
          what I mean.

377
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,507
        Yeah, I get it.
       I get that, boss.

378
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,476
           -Well, you
         take care now.
           -Yes, sir.

379
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:57,594
          Amos Jenkins
       just invited me to
     Bible study at church.

380
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,529
           Oh, that's
          who that is.

381
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,586
<i> No developments</i>
    <i> in the case of JT Doyle,</i>

382
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:26,656

390
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,798
         Amos Jenkins,
      how you doing, pal?

391
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,701
              Hey.
           Part-time.
      How's it going, man?

392
00:37:17,703 --> 00:37:19,469
        -How you doing?
       -Listen, I'm gonna
           take off.

393
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,239
       -Okay, be careful.
          -All right.

394
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,741
      -Good morning, Gus.
         -How are you?

395
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,744
        Well, do you got
       enough bolting men
     for the morning shift?

396
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,248
       What do you mean?

397
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:33,516
         I'd like to do
    a little something, Gus.

398
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:36,620
        I can't let you
        go in the mine.

399
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:39,389
         You have to be
         re-certified,
          re-trained.

400
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,293
      Gus, I ain't looking
       for a handout now.

401
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:45,795
      I just... You can't
      put me underground?

402
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,933
    Can you use a computer?

403
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:52,602
      Maybe I can put you
  in the dispatcher's office,

404
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,938
      or the hoist house,
         or something.

405
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:59,676
     I ain't the best, Gus,
       but I'll learn it.

406
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:04,814
      Well, thanks, y'all.
         I'd say we got
       a lot done today.

407
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,290
      Bill, can you stick
      around for a second?

408
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,825
       Yeah. Sure thing.

409
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:22,065
     As you probably know,
        there's gonna be
   an internal investigation.

410
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:27,537
     we've already started
     looking into timelines
     and events and things.

411
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,773
           And based
       on these findings,

412
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:34,377
        we really think
      it's best for you to
     seek your own counsel.

413
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,914
      Sure. I understand.

414
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:40,717
       And it's customary
    that you'll be suspended

415
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:43,386
         for the length
     of the investigation.

416
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,459
       This is... This is
     a rough time for you,
    Bill, we both know that.

417
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:54,597
  but you're gonna have to be
 gone by the end of the month.

418
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:57,767
         And then we'll
        see how it goes.

419
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,474
    I'll see you out, John.
        Take care, Bill.

420
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,562
      You're a lucky stiff
      with this swing set.

421
00:39:25,564 --> 00:39:26,629
            I know.

422
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,376
  What happened in the woods,

423
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:42,979
     that was an accident.

424
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,081
Yeah, accident.

425
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,453
      Like dad, remember?

426
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,158
         Yup. He didn't
           come home.

427
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:00,563
         That's right.
    It happened by mistake.

428
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,935
         Mom was upset.
           She cried.

429
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:10,473
    Yeah, you don't want her
      to cry again, right?
        You understand?

430
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:12,809
        You better keep
        your mouth shut.

431
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,948
       Where's that boy?

432
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,158
     Forget about that boy.

433
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,204
          You promise
          to be quiet?

434
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:44,174
              Yes.

435
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,977
       I won't give these
         to you anymore
         if you don't,

436
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,747
        you understand?

437
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,082
             -Yes.
             -Good.

438
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:19,509
      Good night, Georgie.
         -Take it easy.

439
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,694
          Why are you
         home so late?

440
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:40,663
        Sorry. I'm just
       going through some
        files from work.

441
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,567
         I already had
          a sandwich,
           I'm good.

442
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,790
         I've got three
         meteorologists
           on record

443
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:17,961
        saying lightning
         struck at 6:28
         and 6:29 a.m.,

444
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:19,996
         and apparently
           they were
        strong strikes.

445
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,799
      Maybe everyone will
     stop pointing fingers.

446
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:25,835
     Bill, company counsel
       is already talking
      criminal negligence,

447
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,707
        Just be careful
   what you say to the other
     employees, all right?

448
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:31,774
             Yeah.

449
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,345
        At least Jenkins
         ain't talking.

450
00:43:35,347 --> 00:43:38,214
         And seems like
        he's not joining
       the class action.

451
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:40,650
             -Yeah.
          -That's good
         news for you.

452
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,220
        I could sure use
        some good news.

453
00:43:44,222 --> 00:43:46,322
          Will you try
        to take it easy?

454
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:47,790
            I will.

455
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:16,819

       We're in session.

469
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,798
        I know. I, uh...

470
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,733
            I, uh...

471
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,136
Would you
      like to have a seat?

472
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:09,706
      Could someone please
     make a space for her?

473
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,975
Welcome.
          Have a seat.

474
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:18,981
Thank you.

475
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:23,986
       Thank you so much.
      I'm sorry. So sorry.

476
00:45:23,988 --> 00:45:26,089
We all welcome
       you here tonight.

477
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:29,325
     And we're all praying
      for the safe return
          of your son.

478
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:31,260
           It must be
       a difficult time.

479
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:33,129
           Thank you.

480
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,065
       We were discussing
       this week's topic,

481
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:39,268
       the importance of
    sharing your weaknesses
        with each other.

482
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,804
         Let's continue
        around the room.

483
00:45:41,806 --> 00:45:43,973
            Nellie,
      we're at you, right?

484
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:49,078
     Well, it's hard for me
  to talk about my weaknesses,

485
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:52,749
         since weakness
     isn't really something
       that we talk a lot

486
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:58,955
     So... And we're always
       just trying to put
        on a happy face.

487
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:02,325
    I'm trying to be strong
       for my sister and
    my nephews, especially.

488
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:05,962
You all know what I mean.

489
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:10,399
I've been praying
        a lot to help me
    in the past few months.

490
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:15,104
      my baby sister lost
    her son in the accident,
           you know.

491
00:46:17,175 --> 00:46:18,508
        It's causing her
     lots of depression...

492
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,943
       Ma'am, you having
       trouble breathing?

493
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:23,246
         Are you okay?
       You need some air?

494
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:25,047
           It's fine.

495
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:26,816
      Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

496
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,522
It looks like you're
   hyperventilating, sweetie.

497
00:46:32,524 --> 00:46:34,824
        Let me get a bag
    for you to breathe into.

498
00:46:34,826 --> 00:46:36,492
          Oh, please,
      please don't get up.

499
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:39,061
      Would you like to go
        to the fountain
      and get some water?

500
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:42,331
       It's in the hall.
         -Yes, I will.
       I will get some...

501
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,505
Please don't get up.
      I'll get some water.

502
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,349
Amos.
           -Oh, okay.
        I'm sorry, um...

503
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,922
       Well, I ain't sure
          what to say.

504
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:13,029
It's been awful
        rough to get out
      of a coma, for sure.

505
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:23,372
     You know, I thank God
    I'm alive, I really do,

506
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:29,212
        but I just want
      to be normal again.

507
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,348
        Everything back
        the way it was.

508
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,520
       I don't know what
      to do when I wake up
         every morning.

509
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:41,457
    Lost 10 miners in there,

510
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:43,359
      and I can't get them
        out of my head.

511
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:49,532
   It's rough on you to know
 that you're the only one left.

512
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:19,962
          You feeling
          any better?

513
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:23,566
          Not really.

514
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:28,504
          I'm happy to
        give you a ride,
        if you need one.

515
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,440
     I just need a minute.

516
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:36,579
         That was nice
         what you said.

517
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:41,584
       It must feel good
        to have a group
     of people to talk to.

518
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,022
          Yeah, well,
      it's about the most
      I've said in a year.

519
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:48,457
    We never officially met.

520
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:53,329
          You're Amos?
          -Yes, ma'am.

521
00:48:53,331 --> 00:48:55,932
            -Diana.
   -Nice to meet you, ma'am.

522
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,472
       I'm really not in
     a condition to drive.

523
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,475
          I sure ain't
        the best driver.

524
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:11,180
      You can get me from
      point A to point B,
           can't you?

525
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:13,616
      Yeah, I can do that.

526
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:20,222
       I'm just up here,
         on the right.

527
00:49:20,224 --> 00:49:22,058
          I know where
        you live, ma'am.

528
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:24,493
           It ain't a
        big town, is it?

529
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,700
         Got no leads?

530
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:37,106
    No, they found a runaway
    in Tennessee last week,
       but it wasn't him.

531
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:44,380
     What are all the folks
    in town saying about it?

532
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:48,451
       Everyone's really
         upset, ma'am.

533
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:55,758
          This is me.

534
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:03,199
         Let me get you
         to your door.

535
00:50:03,201 --> 00:50:04,667
       Oh, no. I'm good.

536
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:08,170
         Oh, it sticks.

537
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:13,676
      Your, uh... Your car
      gonna be all right?

538
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:17,580
      Yeah. I'll have one
     of Bill's guys get it
     for me in the morning.

539
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,516
           All right.
          -All right.

540
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:24,186
           Thank you.
          Good night.

541
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:36,532
         You go down to
       the police station
     to see the new photos?

542
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,167
             Yeah.

543
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:40,102
        There's nothing.

544
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,808
         And you heard
        they brought in
         some meth-head

545
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:48,778
        for questioning,
    and nothing came of it?

546
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,513
     I guess he was clean.

547
00:50:50,515 --> 00:50:52,448
       Yeah, that's what
         Peterson said.

548
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:02,591
        Everything just
        bounces off you
       so easy, don't it?

549
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:06,195
             Sorry?

550
00:51:06,197 --> 00:51:10,099
         It seems like
        you're cheerful,
     grilling your steaks.

551
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:13,736
     Well, we can't expect
    you to cook around here,
          now can we?

552
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:17,573
         We'd be eating
          potato chips
         and onion dip.

553
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:22,745
        Yeah, I'm sorry.
     I have something else
          on my mind.

554
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:28,684
    I don't have the luxury
  of sitting around the house
      all day in mourning.

555
00:51:28,686 --> 00:51:32,221
        And I don't have
     the luxury of drowning
       myself in my work.

556
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,790
       It must be a nice
      distraction for you.

557
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:38,661
       I'm just trying to
      actively do things,
             Diana.

558
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:42,264
        Don't you think
         it pains me to
       watch you unravel?

559
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,800
         We don't know
         anything yet.

560
00:51:44,802 --> 00:51:46,836
        It's like you've
       fucking given up.

561
00:51:46,838 --> 00:51:48,304
          I have not.

562
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:50,139
       Pills, cigarettes.

563
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:53,375
    It's hard to watch you.
         You should get
      your shit together.

564
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,473
          Mrs. Doyle?

565
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,312
         I didn't mean
        to startle you.

566
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:38,747
        No. It's, uh...

567
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:40,783
           It's okay.

568
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,819
          What are you
        doing out here?

569
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:47,823
           New pack.

570
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,394
     I wouldn't be out here
     too long if I was you.

571
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,564
      All kinds of weirdos
       out at this hour.

572
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:04,306
         God, not much
       fazes me anymore.

573
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:07,943
         I drive around
      a lot late at night.

574
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:09,845
          I'm just...

575
00:54:09,847 --> 00:54:11,880
         I think maybe
           I'm gonna

576
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:16,018
      spot him somewhere.

577
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,020
It's crazy.

578
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:19,722
         It's so crazy.

579
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:25,628
      No, it ain't crazy.

580
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:30,933
          What are you
        doing out here?
         It's so late.

581
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:36,538
         I can't sleep.
          I had to get
         some medicine.

582
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:40,542
             Oh...

583
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,303
         Can I do this?

584
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:19,982
           I'm sorry.

585
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:25,087
       Please, don't say
         you're sorry.

586
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,037
          What are you
          giving away?

587
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:52,007
        Free yard work.
    I can work any Saturday
      you want this month.

588
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:56,044
           Oh. Well,
       that sounds good.
       My yard's a mess.

589
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:00,682
    What's your name, ma'am?

590
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:02,551
          Diana Doyle.

591
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,120
        I have to put it
         on the ticket.

592
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:08,524
           Good luck.

593
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:41,523
        I've never been
       in a motel before.

594
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:49,131
        We used to come
      to a place like this
        in high school.

595
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,601
       The seniors would
        rent the rooms,

596
00:57:52,603 --> 00:57:55,103
      and we'd all file in
        with six-packs.

597
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:04,813
           You okay?

598
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:07,483
             Yeah.

599
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,624
         They're gonna
        find him, ma'am.

600
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:23,198
     Don't call me "ma'am."

601
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:04,907
You going in?

602
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:08,677
            Oh, no.
        I just swung by.

603
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:14,082
Why are you
         working there?

604
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:20,756
         Because I like
         to work, Carl.

605
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:23,692
      Coal is all I know.

606
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,795
      Makes you look like
       there's something
        wrong with you.

607
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:32,568
         You want those
        people to think
     you're on their side?

608
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:35,871
       This thing is big.

609
00:59:35,873 --> 00:59:37,105
      Don't you get that?

610
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:40,275
Dumb son-of-a-bitch.

611
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,980
       You like watching
      from the sidelines?

612
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:48,283
      I wonder what Junior
      and the rest of them
        would be saying

613
00:59:48,285 --> 00:59:50,118
         if they could
          see you now.

614
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,354
        Why don't you go
         fuck yourself,
        how 'bout that?

615
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:55,257
   Seems like you're feeling
   like your old self again.

616
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:58,226
       People been saying
    some interesting things.

617
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:05,801
       One of my workers
      said they saw you at
    Bible study on Tuesday.

618
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:11,273
          Yeah. Yeah,
        I've been twice.

619
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:14,209
      I guess that's good
       if it helps, huh?

620
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:15,611
           It gets me
       out of the house.

621
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:21,617
    This Bible study thing,
     it's what Amos Jenkins
         invited me to?

622
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:25,621
     Yeah, that's the one.

623
01:00:25,623 --> 01:00:29,758
      You do realize that
     he's the guy the Feds
     are talking to, right?

624
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,361
   If people in town see you
    talking to mining folks,

625
01:00:32,363 --> 01:00:33,895
       it could be weird,
        don't you think?

626
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:37,866
         What do I care
       what people think?

627
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:40,769
        You might wanna
    connect the dots, Diana.

628
01:00:40,771 --> 01:00:41,870
     It just looks shitty.

629
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:52,280
        Bunny and Sandy
       say they never see
          you anymore.

630
01:00:52,282 --> 01:00:53,715
          They say...
       Bunny and Sandy...

631
01:00:53,717 --> 01:00:55,684
        They say you're
     avoiding their calls.

632
01:00:55,686 --> 01:00:57,119
       Jesus. I can't...

633
01:00:57,121 --> 01:00:58,420
          I can't deal
     with their pitying...

634
01:00:58,422 --> 01:00:59,688
          They're not
          pitying you.

635
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:03,191
     It's not pity, Diana.
          They're just
      checking in on you.

636
01:01:03,193 --> 01:01:04,993
        -Oh, it's pity.
   -They're just being nice.

637
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:09,297
       Speaking of Sandy,

638
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:12,067
          I heard you
        hired a lawyer.

639
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:13,802
           Greenbaum?

640
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:17,439
       He's a lawyer the
      company recommended.

641
01:01:17,441 --> 01:01:21,076
        Yeah. Why is it
       you need your own
         lawyer anyway?

642
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:24,713
         Jerry doesn't
         have a lawyer.

643
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,951
     Company's not vouching
        for you anymore?

644
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,026
           It's worse
        than I thought.

645
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:40,262
        I ended up being
          more exposed
        than I thought.

646
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:42,197
         More exposed?
      What does that mean?

647
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:44,299
          It's not my
         fault, Diana.

648
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:48,804
           I just did
       what they told me
     they wanted me to do,

649
01:01:48,806 --> 01:01:51,940
      and in the process,
       I made a shitload
    of money for everybody.

650
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:56,845
         You were right
          to spare me
          the details,

651
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:59,247
          because they
         make me sick.

652
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:04,786
       And you don't care
        that I could be
       the fall-guy here?

653
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:08,290
         Well, I guess
          we both know

654
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:10,292
           it wasn't
       a lightning strike
         now, don't we?

655
01:02:10,294 --> 01:02:13,462
  Hey, you say what you will,
   but you like your things.

656
01:02:13,464 --> 01:02:16,431
    Your car, this remodel,
       all your clothes.

657
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:18,166
        So don't you go
        acting all high
          and mighty!

658
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:56,772
     My wife's putting you
       to work now, huh?

659
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:01,243
         Yeah, she won
          the raffle.

660
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:03,845
         Yeah, I heard.

661
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:06,848
             Bill.
             -Owen.

662
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:09,117
        Owen. Owen what?

663
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:11,086
          Owen Briggs.

664
01:03:11,088 --> 01:03:15,023
          Owen Briggs,
     you're in high school,
     right? In JT's school?

665
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:18,260
             Yeah.

666
01:03:18,262 --> 01:03:19,928
      You're Junior's son?

667
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:23,999
             Yeah.

668
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:26,067
    Yeah, you look like him.

669
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:30,906
     How's your mom doing?
          -She's fine.

670
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:37,412
      What I'd like to do
       is get rid of all
     this beach furniture,

671
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:38,880
      and the patio stuff,

672
01:03:38,882 --> 01:03:40,515
        just get it all
        moved out back.

673
01:03:40,517 --> 01:03:43,285
       Just generally get
    this corner cleaned out.

674
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:48,323
       You like to ride?

675
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:52,360
             Yeah.

676
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:02,537
        You have a bike?

677
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:04,940
           No, ma'am.

678
01:04:04,942 --> 01:04:07,209
        I did, but it's
      small now, I guess.

679
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:14,316
           Hey, Bill.

680
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,487
       Bill, can you dig
       out this old bike?

681
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:22,858
           Which one?
       The old blue one.

682
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:25,327
          JT got this
        new one anyhow.

683
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:26,595
           It's just
        collecting dust.

684
01:04:26,597 --> 01:04:30,232
Will you make sure
   it's still in good shape?

685
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:43,979
        All right. Good.

686
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:48,316
          I'll see you
       on Saturday, then.

687
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:56,491
          How do those
          wheels feel?

688
01:04:56,493 --> 01:04:58,660
         They're good.
   -Yeah, they're all right.

689
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,365
       All right, well...

690
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,369
      You sure it's okay?
       -Yeah, it's okay.

691
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:09,905
            Be safe.

692
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:14,736
              Hey!

693
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,640
          How did you
          get in here?
       I jumped the bank.

694
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:25,180
        You shouldn't be
    snooping around in here,
        it's dangerous.

695
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:29,351
        You're walking.
   -Yeah, I'm getting there.

696
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,357
      Are you taking care
         of your mama?

697
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:36,691
          Yeah, I am.

698
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:42,063
         Well, can you
       tell me what is it
         that you want?

699
01:06:42,065 --> 01:06:43,164
            Nothing.

700
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:44,499
           I was just
        looking around.

701
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,572
            Did you
         find anything?

702
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:53,108
              No.

703
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:59,114
       You think you can
      take me in the mine?

704
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:04,252
          You can't be
           going down
        in here too far.

705
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:06,755
            Is this
         the Number 3?

706
01:07:06,757 --> 01:07:08,556
       No, of course not.

707
01:07:08,558 --> 01:07:12,160
     It's been closed down.
           Sealed up.

708
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:18,600
       You miss your pop?

709
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:20,568
             Yeah.

710
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:24,205
       Sometimes I think
    James forgets about him.

711
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:26,207
      No. He don't forget.

712
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:28,243
        He's a sly one,
         your brother,

713
01:07:28,245 --> 01:07:30,345
    he's a whole lot smarter
     than you think he is.

714
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:34,349
           All right,
      turn on that light.

715
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,802
           Them beams
       hold up the roof,

716
01:07:53,804 --> 01:07:57,238
        and the face is
        all the way down
        about a mile in.

717
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:59,441
         Does this look
         like Number 3?

718
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:03,078
           Oh, that's
      a whole lot bigger.

719
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:15,623
          Did you see
          my dad die?

720
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:22,097
       Were you near him?

721
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:25,233
     Yeah. I was near him.

722
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:29,304
     We was all taking care
         of each other.

723
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:33,374
       Helping each other
    with the self-rescuers.

724
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:38,146
         Y'all couldn't
        breathe, right?

725
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:44,619
   We was having a hard time.

726
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:01,870
     How come you survived,
      and nobody else did?

727
01:09:01,872 --> 01:09:04,305
           Did you do
      something different?

728
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,609
      I had luck, I guess.

729
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:12,547
   It was a waste to save me,
     if you think about it.

730
01:09:12,549 --> 01:09:14,816
          I ain't got
      no family, no kids.

731
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,286
       You got your dad.

732
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:23,424
          That's true.

733
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,573
       What do you think
       it's like to die?

734
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:44,846
         Son, there was
    no one in pain in there.

735
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:48,850
       You understand me?

736
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:57,625
         Come on, now.

737
01:09:57,627 --> 01:10:00,762
        They'll give me
       an ass whooping if
    they find you down here.

738
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,837
        Go on, get that
       door open for me.

739
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:13,341
         Which button?
     That one right there.

740
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,559
         You can't use
        that bar of soap
         in your hair.

741
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:33,995
          I use soap.
   I'm a one-stop shop, baby.

742
01:10:33,997 --> 01:10:35,697
          I don't use
          that stuff.
              No.

743
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:37,765
           Come here.
         I'm gonna take
          care of you.

744
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:39,634
          I don't want
        the pink stuff.

745
01:10:39,636 --> 01:10:41,669
      I don't... Don't put
        that in my hair.
        I don't want it.

746
01:10:41,671 --> 01:10:42,837
          I use soap.

747
01:10:45,307 --> 01:10:47,342
           Come here.
            -No. No,
      I don't want that...

748
01:10:47,344 --> 01:10:48,509
           Come here.

749
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:51,246
     Don't say "no" to me.

750
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:53,514
         I'll say "no."
     -Don't say "no" to me.

751
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:57,318
            Oh, God.
     I got soap in my eyes.

752
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,653
          Oh, get in.

753
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:06,761
              Ah!

754
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:32,053
          Get it out.
        -It's okay, now.

755
01:11:32,055 --> 01:11:33,521
          Get it out.

756
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:36,958
       Are you all right?

757
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:40,361
         Are you okay?
        -I got it, baby.

758
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:55,043
         Come on, Owen.
          Owen, stop!

759
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:03,751
            That was
       such a pathetic...

760
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:11,025
          Wait for me.

761
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:29,344
          Nobody goes
       in there anymore.

762
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:40,088
       If you're scared,
         we don't have
       to go any further.

763
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:02,377
Did he
          do it again?
             -Yeah.

764
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:04,746
        That's the third
        time this week.

765
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:07,749
         He's a bundle
       of nerves lately.

766
01:13:07,751 --> 01:13:09,584
     What's wrong with him?
  Did he say anything to you?

767
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:10,852
              No.

768
01:13:10,854 --> 01:13:12,620
         Maybe if you'd
       stop babying him.

769
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:15,723
      You guys don't tell
      anybody what's going
       on in your heads.

770
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:18,659
      That's what I think.
    You just keep it all in.

771
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:21,028
            Please.

772
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:24,932
       You got work this
      morning, don't you?

773
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:26,734
             Yeah.

774
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:31,406
          Don't linger
      at that place, okay?
        Just in and out.

775
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:33,141
         Okay. I won't.

776
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:39,013
        How do you want
         these folded?

777
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:42,550
Oh, honey, I don't
    think the Salvation Army
         is gonna care.

778
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:51,959
   You're not gonna throw out
   any of JT's stuff, right?

779
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:55,096
        No, just, uh...
        This is all old,
         junkie stuff.

780
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:58,566
      I'm keeping all the
  special sentimental things.

781
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:02,503
       I can't even think
       to touch his room.

782
01:14:02,505 --> 01:14:04,172
        I wouldn't want
       to move a pencil.

783
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:08,709
Oh, my God.

784
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:10,778
      I got this the year
         I was married.

785
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:13,014
      Yeah, it looks old.

786
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:18,886
        It's crazy what
         you hold on to
      for no good reason.

787
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:25,827
       Have you ever been
        in a coal mine?

788
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:27,995
        Uh, not really.

789
01:14:27,997 --> 01:14:33,568
     I went on a field trip
   in grade school, and that
       was enough for me.

790
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:37,472
   I was real claustrophobic
          down there.

791
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:41,976
       I went down in one
         the other day.
     It was a rookie mine.

792
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,678
          My dad died
          in Number 3.

793
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:50,751
      I just wanted to see
      what it looked like
         where he died.

794
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:57,091
       Actually, we kept
   three of my dad's shirts.

795
01:14:57,926 --> 01:15:00,795
    We each picked one out.
     Me, my mom, and James.

796
01:15:01,763 --> 01:15:03,764
    We wear them sometimes.

797
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:09,871
      Oh, who's that now?

798
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:15,710
            Hang on,
      I'll be right back.

799
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:11,058
      We never talk about
      your son now, do we?

800
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:20,368
          I don't want
         to burden you.

801
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:22,770
          But you can,
         though, babe.

802
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,144
          It's just...

803
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:39,654
       Something I don't
       wanna talk about.

804
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:43,858
     I think about it every
      second of every day
       when I'm at home.

805
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:50,965
        So this is your
      vacation then, huh?

806
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:56,937
             Yeah.

807
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:58,739
              Mmm.

808
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:25,733
           Hey, Amos!

809
01:18:29,071 --> 01:18:30,237
             Shit.

810
01:18:40,782 --> 01:18:43,150
         Why can't you
       lift your arm up?

811
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:49,824
          See how the
        table's turned?

812
01:18:49,826 --> 01:18:53,427
   Just a couple months ago,
   I was doing this for you.

813
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:56,363
    Yeah. Ain't we the pair.

814
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:04,805
          You need you
       some medicine now.

815
01:19:04,807 --> 01:19:07,141
     That cough ain't gonna
      go away on its own.

816
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:13,080
     You want that oxygen?

817
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:15,916
       I'll get it later.
     Don't worry about it.

818
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:24,925
         You want me to
      turn that light off?

819
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,527
         Yeah. Turn it
          off for me.

820
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:39,807
    Make it a double, Patty.

821
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:46,447
          Here you go,
         and this one's
         on Bill Doyle.

822
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:55,289
      On Bill Doyle, huh?
         -Yup. On Bill.

823
01:20:03,832 --> 01:20:05,933
        What's up, Amos?
          -Hey, boys.

824
01:20:05,935 --> 01:20:07,268
     How's it going, buddy?

825
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:09,503
     What's going on, Amos?
     Let's buy you a drink.

826
01:20:09,505 --> 01:20:12,206
          Hey, Patty,
    get a round for the bar.

827
01:20:12,208 --> 01:20:13,474
     Yeah, get us a round.

828
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:16,343
Give Amos
         a double here.

829
01:20:16,345 --> 01:20:17,945
Yeah. Get him drunk.

830
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:20,381
         We're waiting
          to hear what
       you're gonna say.

831
01:20:20,383 --> 01:20:22,516
     You ain't gonna put us
     out of work, are you?

832
01:20:22,518 --> 01:20:24,852
         You know we're
         a dying breed.

833
01:20:24,854 --> 01:20:27,087
      Yeah. We're a dying
        breed, is right.

834
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:31,292
       I might as well be
        in the dirt with
       the rest of them.

835
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:36,931
          You wanna...
   You wanna take care of us?

836
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,467
        Yeah. I'll take
      care of you, Jerry.

837
01:20:40,469 --> 01:20:42,002
Are you sure
        you're not gonna
         fuck us over?

838
01:20:42,004 --> 01:20:43,337
       Yeah. If they find
        something wrong,

839
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:46,073
       they're gonna shut
      us down completely.

840
01:20:46,075 --> 01:20:48,175
    You like getting food on
  the table, don't you, Jerry?

841
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:49,476
           Yes, sir.

842
01:20:49,478 --> 01:20:51,946
- We need to work.
- We gotta work.

843
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:55,316
Have one
        with all of us.

844
01:20:55,318 --> 01:20:57,051
        Come on, cheers!
            Cheers.

845
01:20:57,053 --> 01:20:59,119
- To Bonford Coal, man.
- To Bonford Coal.

846
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,992
You enjoying
      your freshman year?

847
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:06,861
         Yeah, sort of.

848
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:11,398
           It's been
         a weird year.

849
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:13,634
I'm sure.

850
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:16,503
     Make any good friends?

851
01:21:16,505 --> 01:21:18,038
         Yeah, I guess.

852
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:21,976
     I'm not very popular,
           but I have
      a few good friends.

853
01:21:23,578 --> 01:21:26,113
      Well, that's really
         all you need.

854
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:28,983
      I think people that
     have a lot of friends

855
01:21:28,985 --> 01:21:31,352
        are usually not
       that interesting.

856
01:21:32,153 --> 01:21:34,622
       Were you popular?
    You seem like you were.

857
01:21:35,323 --> 01:21:36,490
             I do?

858
01:21:36,492 --> 01:21:41,462
         so that always
      brought me a certain
      amount of attention.

859
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:47,334
        What was he like
          that Friday?

860
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:48,636
              Who?

861
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:51,906
              JT.

862
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:59,313
        I know you were
     in the woods with him.
      With all them boys.

863
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:06,020
     He was joking around.

864
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:09,924
   He was having a good time
     with those fireworks.

865
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:17,164
       He was having fun?

866
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:19,066
             Yeah.

867
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:23,437
         You guys were
         all laughing,
      having a good time?

868
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:25,673
             Yeah.

869
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:30,477
         Was he happy?
        Do you remember?

870
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:37,084
             Yeah.

871
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:41,355
          That's good.

872
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:48,362
         Oh, I'm sorry,
            Owen...

873
01:22:48,364 --> 01:22:50,064
        I shouldn't have
     asked you about that.

874
01:22:50,066 --> 01:22:53,100
    That's... It's not fair,
      it's just upsetting.

875
01:22:58,039 --> 01:23:00,240
         You wanna use
         the restroom?

876
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:43,050
    You're testifying again?

877
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:45,185
             Yeah.

878
01:23:45,487 --> 01:23:47,788
       Last time, I hope.
           I hate it.

879
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:50,157
     When is that gonna be?

880
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:51,759
         I don't know.

881
01:23:58,233 --> 01:23:59,666
         In two weeks.

882
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:06,073
    What are you gonna say?

883
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:12,713
       Well, my dad don't
   want me to say nothing...

884
01:24:14,616 --> 01:24:16,450
       Nothing that would
    incriminate the company.

885
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:21,155
    What do you want to do?

886
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:24,191
       What do you mean?

887
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:28,829
    I mean, you always just
      do whatever he says?

888
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:30,497
              No.

889
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:36,670
   If you know what happened
    in that mine, you should
      say something, Amos.

890
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:42,676
     I don't wanna mess up
    your life more than it's

891
01:24:42,678 --> 01:24:45,079
    already been messed up,
     to tell you the truth.

892
01:24:47,549 --> 01:24:49,850
        You should worry
        about yourself.

893
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:54,655
       I mean, ain't your
        life messed up?

894
01:24:54,657 --> 01:24:56,123
         They made you
       a goddamn cripple.

895
01:24:56,125 --> 01:24:57,758
           I ain't no
        goddamn cripple.

896
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:00,294
         You're keeping
       quiet, and you're
       working there now?

897
01:25:00,296 --> 01:25:01,795
        What do you care
        if I work there
            or not?

898
01:25:01,797 --> 01:25:05,299
       What's it to you?
         -You shouldn't
         do it for me.

899
01:25:05,301 --> 01:25:07,668
          Why can't I
        be nice to you?
             -No...

900
01:25:08,269 --> 01:25:10,304
     You're hung up on this
      whole goddamn thing.

901
01:25:10,306 --> 01:25:11,605
        Way too hung up.

902
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:14,508
        I mean, what am
    I supposed to be to you?
        Your girlfriend?

903
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:15,742
         No, you ain't
         my girlfriend.

904
01:25:15,744 --> 01:25:17,311
   That would be beneath you.

905
01:25:17,313 --> 01:25:19,213
        I have a family.
      -I ain't good enough
         for you, am I?

906
01:25:19,215 --> 01:25:20,280
            Do you?

907
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:25,319
       Oh, Diana. I'm...
        -That is cruel.

908
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:27,754
        Diana, come on.

909
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:42,336
         This place is
        like a dungeon!

910
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:08,462
         These curtains
        are disgusting.

911
01:26:32,754 --> 01:26:35,589
       You want me to fry
     a bit of ham for you?

912
01:26:36,391 --> 01:26:38,792
        Cook it up with
       that string bean?

913
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:45,832
    I said, "Do you want me
      to fry up that ham?"

914
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:44,017
       What's the matter?

915
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:55,462
       I know you didn't
         say anything.

916
01:28:55,697 --> 01:28:57,030
       You've been good.

917
01:29:37,572 --> 01:29:38,839
            Uh, yes.

918
01:29:40,575 --> 01:29:42,609
          Can I talks
         to Joel Kitts?

919
01:29:43,811 --> 01:29:46,780
            Mmm-hmm.
           Yes, it's
         Amos Jenkins.

920
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:52,152
      Don't I get a hello?

921
01:29:52,987 --> 01:29:54,087
              Hi.

922
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:58,458
Are you hungry?
       -No, I got cereal.

923
01:29:58,894 --> 01:30:04,131
    You're good at cleaning
     other people's houses,
       but not your own?

924
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:08,001
      I saw your employer
       at the hair salon.

925
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,638
      I gotta say my heart
    goes out to that woman.

926
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:13,840
          Not knowing
       is gotta be awful.

927
01:30:19,547 --> 01:30:21,648
     You think Bill Doyle's
     gonna get in trouble?

928
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:23,750
   Don't he deserve trouble?

929
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:26,153
        Not if lightning
        struck the mine.

930
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,656
       They're not as bad
       as everybody says.

931
01:30:29,658 --> 01:30:31,691
        Who? The Doyles?
             -Yeah.

932
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,928
        Why? 'Cause they
        gave you a bike?

933
01:30:35,129 --> 01:30:38,131
   What about all the things
        I've given you?
     Your father gave you?

934
01:30:41,969 --> 01:30:44,204
      What's up your ass?
           Excuse me?

935
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:47,207
         Don't you talk
        to me like that.

936
01:30:47,209 --> 01:30:49,576
          Where's your
        fucking head at?

937
01:30:50,211 --> 01:30:52,579
     Even when you're here,
        you're not here.

938
01:30:52,581 --> 01:30:53,847
           I can't do
     everything on my own.

939
01:30:53,849 --> 01:30:55,449
        This is stupid!

940
01:30:57,785 --> 01:30:59,486
      Where are you going?

941
01:32:08,723 --> 01:32:10,657
     Well, look who it is.

942
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:18,131
        What do you say,
   you want you a milkshake?

943
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:19,799
             Yeah.

944
01:32:20,268 --> 01:32:22,769
           Get him...
       What do you want?

945
01:32:22,771 --> 01:32:24,538
       I want chocolate.

946
01:32:24,805 --> 01:32:26,640
Sure thing, sweetie.

947
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:40,053
      You're awful quiet.

948
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:48,094
       Hey, are you okay?

949
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:34,901
           Hey, Owen.

950
01:34:34,903 --> 01:34:36,936
       I didn't know you
       were coming today.

951
01:35:27,955 --> 01:35:29,889
<i> Was the coal dust</i>
    <i> level something that was</i>

952
01:35:29,891 --> 01:35:31,491
        <i> a concern before</i>
         <i> the accident?</i>

953
01:35:33,294 --> 01:35:34,761
<i> Yes, sir.</i>

954
01:35:34,763 --> 01:35:36,329
<i> Who voiced</i>
         <i> this concern?</i>

955
01:35:37,865 --> 01:35:39,799
<i> Well, we all did.</i>

956
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,902
       But it was Junior
    who made a fuss mostly.

957
01:35:44,271 --> 01:35:47,741
    He came to me a few days
      before the accident.

958
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:53,113
      he was gonna request
  a transfer to another mine.

959
01:35:54,815 --> 01:35:57,817
     He felt like something
     bad was gonna happen.

960
01:35:58,386 --> 01:36:03,423
        did Junior ever
   confront Bill Doyle about
     these safety concerns?

961
01:36:04,191 --> 01:36:05,859
           Yes, sir.

962
01:36:07,128 --> 01:36:09,028
   Junior said Bill told him

963
01:36:10,531 --> 01:36:14,167
      that he better keep
   his mouth shut if he knew
     what was good for him.

964
01:36:14,169 --> 01:36:16,870
       What do you think
      Bill meant by that?

965
01:36:17,538 --> 01:36:22,542
       I reckon he meant,
      "Don't start talking
   about it being dangerous."

966
01:36:24,512 --> 01:36:28,782
    Like, "Don't say nothing
    to the other workers to
        get them upset."

967
01:36:30,017 --> 01:36:33,853
   Would you say, in general,
   that there was a tradition
  of silence in the workplace?

968
01:36:36,490 --> 01:36:40,393
       Well, with Junior
  we could usually find a way

969
01:36:41,896 --> 01:36:45,331
      to get things fixed
   without hurting production
           too much.

970
01:36:46,267 --> 01:36:48,268
        But if, or when,
       you complained to
       higher management,

971
01:36:48,270 --> 01:36:51,371
     would you be afraid of
    any sort of retaliation?

972
01:36:55,376 --> 01:36:56,876
           Yes, sir.

973
01:36:58,879 --> 01:37:02,048
      I'd say that's just
      about the way it is.

974
01:37:04,318 --> 01:37:06,886
        Do you remember
      being rescued, Amos?

975
01:37:07,555 --> 01:37:09,923
        No. Not really.

976
01:37:12,293 --> 01:37:14,494
  I was too far gone, I guess.

977
01:37:17,565 --> 01:37:21,835
<i> You don't remember</i>
    <i> the men finally reaching</i>
        <i> you underground?</i>

978
01:37:24,872 --> 01:37:26,139
<i> I just remember...</i>

979
01:37:29,043 --> 01:37:31,010
   <i> I remember being carried.</i>

980
01:37:33,914 --> 01:37:36,616
     <i> Carried up, and seeing</i>
       <i> that light again.</i>

981
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:42,455
          <i> Like the air</i>
  <i> came back into me, like...</i>

982
01:37:43,457 --> 01:37:45,592
     <i> ...Breathe easy again.</i>
