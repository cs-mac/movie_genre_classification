BOXING REFEREE:
This bout, 15 rounds

2
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:16,749
for the heavyweight championship
of the world.

3
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:20,285
The challenger from
Louisville, Kentucky,

4
00:00:20,303 --> 00:00:25,174
weighing 210
and one-half pounds,

5
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:30,128
the former Olympic
light heavyweight champion,

6
00:00:30,146 --> 00:00:32,681
Cassius Clay.

7
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:34,433
Of those of you
who won't be able

8
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,151
to see the Clay-Liston fight,

9
00:00:36,186 --> 00:00:39,605
here is the eighth round
exactly as it will happen.

10
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:41,073
Clay comes out to meet Liston

11
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,141
and Liston starts to retreat.

12
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,943
If Liston goes back
an inch farther,

13
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:47,446
he'll end up
in a ringside seat.

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,616
Clay swings with his left,
Clay swings with his right.

15
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,835
Look at young Cassius
carry the fight.

16
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:55,504
Liston keeps backing,
but there's not enough room--

17
00:00:55,538 --> 00:00:58,323
It's a matter of time--
our Clay lowers the boom.

HOWARD COSELL: Sonny Liston's
not coming out.

20
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:05,047
Sonny Liston is not coming out.

21
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,199
He's out!
The winner and the new

22
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,135
heavyweight champion
of the world is Cassius Clay!

23
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,439
I'm the greatest fighter
that ever lived.

24
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,890
I don't have a mark on my face

25
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,608
and I upset Sonny Liston

26
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,277
and I just turned 22 years old.

27
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,778
I must be the greatest.

28
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:23,282
I shook up the world.
I shook up the world.

29

Cassius is not my name no more.

Officially Muhammad Ali now?

33
00:01:37,914 --> 00:01:39,047
Muhammad Ali.

34
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:42,468
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Muhammad Ali

35
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,202
has just refused to be inducted

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,305
into the United States
Armed Forces.

37
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:49,141
Notification of his refusal
is being made

38
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:50,776
to the United States Attorney,

39
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,178
the State Director of
the Selective Service System,

40
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,080
and the local
Selective Service Board

41
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,648
for whatever action
deemed to be appropriate.

42
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,485

Respectable.

45
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:49,151
Respect for law in a nation

46
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:53,789
is the most priceless asset
a free people can have.

47
00:02:53,823 --> 00:02:56,825
And the Chief Justice
and his associates

48
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:59,995
are the ultimate
custodians and guardians

49
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,548
of that priceless asset.

50
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,717
And when we consider
what a Chief Justice has

51
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:08,754
in the way of influence
on his age

52
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:13,225
and the ages after him, I think
it could fairly be said

53
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:17,396
that our history tells us,
our Chief Justices

54
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,350
have probably had a more
profound and lasting influence

55
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,151
than most Presidents have had.

56
00:03:23,186 --> 00:03:24,236
Good morning, Petrus.

57
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,104
Good morning, sir.
How was your summer?

58
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:28,190
It was good to get away,
Mr. Chief Justice, sir.

59
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,691
Nice to see you again.
You, too, sir.

60
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:30,826
Thank you.

61
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:32,811
Good morning.

[Door opens]

67
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:26,048
Mr. Connolly.
I'm Mrs. Paige, P-A-I-G-E.

68
00:04:26,082 --> 00:04:27,716
You're 27 minutes late.

69
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,084
You're not off to a good start.

70
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,303
I'm sorry. My car broke down.
Mr. Connolly.

71
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,205
Back down the corridor.

72
00:04:34,223 --> 00:04:35,924
The washroom is the third door on the right.

73
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,059
Thank you.

74
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,647
Straight ahead, Mr. Connolly.

75
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,981
We've got ourselves
a live one there,

76
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,883
huh, Mrs. P?

77
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:47,552
Don't flirt with me,
Mr. Becker.

78
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,220
It does not become you.

MEN: Morning, Chief.

00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:54,826
Good morning, sir.
Janet.

81
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:00,365
Ohh.

82
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,619
This term, we really must do

83
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,672
something about this office.

84
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,407
It's ridiculous.
It's not satisfactory.

85
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:13,011
It's smaller than my office
at the Court of Appeals.

86
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,414
I'm the chief, Petrus.
Makes no sense.

87
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:19,017
Take those geraniums
to Maintenance.

88
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,419
Oh, and Petrus,
don't overwater them.

89
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:22,688
They won't bloom.

90
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,356
Yes, sir.

91
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:30,362
Mr. Justice,
this is Kevin Connolly.

92
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:31,563
Sorry I'm late, sir.

93
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,949
Please, take a seat,
Mr. Connolly.

94
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:37,069
Your grandfather.

95
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,956
Yes. He was on the court
for 34 years.

96
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,958
"The great dissenter."

97
00:05:42,992 --> 00:05:45,210
The only justice to vote
against segregation.

98
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,796
Plessy v. Ferguson. 1896.

99
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,631
But even in his dissent
he still

100
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:51,666
called the white race
the dominant race

101
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,219
and vowed it would continue for all time. Heh.

102
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:58,173
Oh, sir, I--I'm sorry.

103
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,592
I wasn't thinking.
That's actually very rude.

104
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,762
You know your Court
history, Mr. Connolly.

105
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:07,816
Or maybe you just did some
research to impress me.

106
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:12,571
There is currently
a case in court.

107
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:15,240
Cohen v. California.

108
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,275
Cohen walked
through a courthouse

109
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:21,079
wearing a jacket with
the words "Fuck the Draft"

110
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,914
inscribed on the back.

111
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,584
He was sentenced to 30 days.

112
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,085
"Congress shall make no law

113
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,087
abridging the freedom
of speech."

114
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,924
That's a very literal interpretation
of the First Amendment.

115
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,493
Clearly, if the First Amendment protects speech of any kind,

116
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:37,429
it protects political speech.

117
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,330
And if the Court is saying that anti-war protests

118
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:41,383
are not protected
by free speech,

119
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,001
then it's not paying
attention to what's

120
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:45,554
going on outside its doors.

121
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,005
I know your war record, sir.

122
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:50,025
Oh? Then you know
I'm no pacifist.

123
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:52,444
You should know I was
a student activist.

124
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,780
I've worked as a legal
advisor to draftees,

125
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,982
informing them of their rights,
I'm a Democrat--

126
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,701
Mr. Connolly, I'm not
interested in your politics.

127
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:02,404
Here we're only
interested in the law.

128
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:06,691
Besides, it's all in here.
Huh.

129
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:07,959
Tell me something.
How would your wife

130
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,378
feel about relocating to DC?

131
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:12,547
Well, clearly,
we've talked about it,

132
00:07:12,582 --> 00:07:13,799
in principle, that is.

133
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,919
She... I think she'd
be very happy for me.

134
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,387
We're expecting
our first child, sir.

135
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:23,541
Oh, how marvelous. Ha!

136
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:26,211
Well, thank you
very much, Mr. Connolly.

137
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,153
Um... are you--are you
gonna hire me, sir?

138
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:39,191
Hmm. Well, we may not
agree on certain matters.

139
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,109
We may take different
positions on many things.

140
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,111
I'm only interested
in your I.Q.,

141
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,080
which I see is substantial.

142
00:07:45,114 --> 00:07:48,283
And your academic skills,
which I note are impressive.

143
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,735
I want brilliant people

144
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:53,238
and I'll take care of the rest.

145
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:56,958
Wow. That's great, sir.
Thank you, sir.

146
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,343
That's all.

147
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,514
Uh--on the other hand,

148
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:03,932
you could make
the argument that

149
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:05,217
wearing a jacket
in the courthouse

150
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,186
is not speech but conduct.

"An absurd and immature antic,"

152
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,940
and is therefore not protected by the First Amendment.

153
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:13,692
Now you're just showing off.

154
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,929
Yes, sir. Mr. Justice.

Guess that makes you the boss.

164
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,670
Oh, I guess it does.

165
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,306
What's with-- with all the lights in there?

166
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,142
That's the justice's eyesight, and it's getting worse.

167
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:48,727
That's you.

168
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,179
Yale, Harvard,
Columbia, Chicago.

169
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,464
That's the norm.
It's tradition.

170
00:08:53,482 --> 00:08:54,900
I don't believe we've ever had a clerk

171
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,135
from the University
of Missouri before.

172
00:08:57,153 --> 00:09:01,489
Yeah, no black clerks,
no women clerks.

173
00:09:01,524 --> 00:09:03,575
I guess that's tradition, too.

174
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,828
Great.
Another bleeding heart liberal

175
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:09,447
Well, you've landed with the wrong justice, my friend.

176
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:10,815
Plus, the Chief is Nixon's man,

177
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,284
and another conservative has just been

178
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,868
appointed to the Court.

179
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,956
Thank you, God, a change is gonna come.

180
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,090
Ow.

181
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,543
Why do you insist
on being called

182
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:22,877
Muhammad Ali now?

183
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,763
That's the name given to me by my leading teacher--

184
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,097
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

185
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,466
That's my original name.
That's a black man name.

186
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,669
Cassius Clay was my slave name.
I'm no longer a slave.

187
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:32,771
What does it mean?

188
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,672
"Muhammad" means
"worthy of all praises"

189
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,942
and "Ali" means "most high."

190
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,610
This will be an organization

191
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,862
that will give the black man
in this country

192
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:43,348
the right to defend himself.

193
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:46,017
It will encourage him
to defend himself,

194
00:09:46,035 --> 00:09:48,370
and it will teach him
how to defend himself.

195
00:09:48,404 --> 00:09:51,456
[Cheers and applause]
By any means necessary.

dance that I use

197
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:55,327
just before the shuffle.

198
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,495
I'm moving and I'm moving
and I'm jumping around

199
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,547
and just before you know it...

200
00:09:59,582 --> 00:10:03,335
a split second right after that
shuffle is the big punch.

We are 22 million people

who don't have our names.

204
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,716
We were named after
our slave masters.

205
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:20,885
So teaches the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad.

206
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:24,239
Once you become free,
find out who you are,

207
00:10:24,273 --> 00:10:27,225
then you will start saying.
"I am the greatest."

Oh. Thank you.

00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,162
I have big plans for the Court this year.

228
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,081
Oh?
During my first year,

229
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,332
it became quite clear to me

230
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,000
there was something wrong with the design

231
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,385
of the courtroom bench.

232
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,754
We're all seated straight in a line.

233
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:30,722
We can't hear each other.

234
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:31,789
We can't see each other.

235
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:33,458
It's terrible acoustics.

236
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:34,726
Here's my solution.

237
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,627
I'm going to curve the bench.
Ah.

238
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:38,430
You see, that way, we can see each other.

239
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,231
We can hear each other.

240
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,933
And it's going to prevent Hugo

242
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,019

The Minnesota twins.

They grew up together.

259
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:30,982
When Burger got married, Blackmun was his best man.

260
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,033
That's why Nixon appointed him.

He's gonna vote with
Burger every time.

a staunch defender
of our Constitution,

00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:45,914
I thought he couldn't have made a better choice,

267
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,882
and his first year on the Court

268
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:50,868
has proven the
President correct.

To Warren.
To Warren. Hear, hear, Warren.

270
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:57,225
I don't know.
What Presidents expect of their Justices

271
00:12:57,259 --> 00:12:59,210
and what those Justices deliver

272
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:01,212

different things.

sneak down to the basement

00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:09,120
[Laughs]

488
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,155
He was the first person to say,
"Don't rush into a decision."

489
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:13,040
He's been very kind.
He's been very understanding.

490
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,542
In his own way...
[Knocking on door]

491
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,661
Mr. Justice, it's time for conference.

492
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,631
You better get going, sir.

493
00:23:37,032 --> 00:23:39,867
Well, I suppose we
should start without him.

494
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:41,285
Yet again.

495
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,823
BURGER:
Phillips v. Marietta.

496
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,195
Now, the woman they wouldn't
hire had preschool children.

497
00:23:51,213 --> 00:23:53,214
How could she hold down a job?

498
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:54,715
That's for her to decide.

499
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:57,251
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

500
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:58,335
an employer can hire--

501
00:23:58,369 --> 00:23:59,753
What's shakin', Chiefy baby?

502
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,006
Oh. We started without you, Thurgood.

503
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,091
We're on Phillips v. Marietta.

504
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,310
Hi. Hey.
As I was saying,

505
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:07,211
as far as I'm concerned,

506
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:09,046
an employer can hire
whoever he wants

507
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:11,065
and for whatever reasons.

508
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:13,050
That is the boss's prerogative.

509
00:24:13,068 --> 00:24:17,521
Now, I'd like to hear why we should hear this case.

510
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:20,658
It's discrimination
on the basis of sex.

511
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,445
Your position amounts to a declaration that

512
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:28,949
part of the Civil Rights Act is unconstitutional.

513
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,918
[Chuckles]

514
00:24:30,952 --> 00:24:32,402
With all respect, Thurgood,

515
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,622
I don't want to argue
legal niceties.

516
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:35,923
You never do.

[Justices chuckling]

BURGER: My first clerk
back in '56

519
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,797
at the Court of Appeals
was a woman.

520
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,599
She had young children,

521
00:24:45,634 --> 00:24:48,252
and she had to leave
every evening at 6:00.

522
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,420
She had to go home.
She had to cook dinner.

523
00:24:50,438 --> 00:24:52,022
Didn't work out well at all.

524
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:03,400
Well, I see you all have
different opinions.

525
00:25:03,434 --> 00:25:06,403
All right.
Why don't we take a vote?

526
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:08,539
[All shouting]

527

[Shouting continues]

528
00:25:26,474 --> 00:25:30,261
BURGER: Clay, a.k.a. Ali,
v. the United States.

529
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,628
This is a waste of
the Court's time.

530
00:25:31,646 --> 00:25:33,597
No one wants to hear this case.

531
00:25:33,631 --> 00:25:36,016
Excuse me, Chief, I want to hear the case.

532
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,302
And I'll tell you why.

533
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,738
Ali never backed down
from his beliefs.

534
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,023
He took the consequences

535
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:44,108
of refusing induction.

536
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,277
Bill, you can't slow
us down on this.

537
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,812
We have a very heavy load of cases to consider today.

538
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,916
He took the consequences.
He lost his title.

539
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,818
He gave up almost
3 years in his prime,

540
00:25:54,836 --> 00:25:56,787
millions of dollars
so that he could stand up

541
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,006
for what his conscience
told him was right.

542
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,991
He's clearly a man
of great principle.

543
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:02,760
The Court is always
on dangerous ground

544
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:06,263
When it decides cases according
to the Justices' own views.

545
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,998
Which one of us is free
of those, John?

546
00:26:08,016 --> 00:26:11,668
I think it's terribly important
that we exercise self-restraint.

547
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:13,187
I think it's also important

548
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:14,671
that we express
what we believe.

549
00:26:14,689 --> 00:26:16,640
Ahh. I'm out of here.

550
00:26:16,674 --> 00:26:19,343
There's clearly
going to be a vote.

551
00:26:19,361 --> 00:26:21,845
I'm recusing myself.

552
00:26:21,863 --> 00:26:23,280
I was the Solicitor General

553
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,616
at the time of
Ali's conviction.

554
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,235
I hate the Nation of Islam, Elijah Muhammad,

555
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:31,521
and his bunch of
thugs and gangsters

556
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:33,874
organized from the jail.

557
00:26:33,908 --> 00:26:37,294
They preach racial segregation.

558
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,247
I am an integrationist.

559
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:47,388
¶

560
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:01,602
I was born in 1908,

561
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:02,603
the year Jack Johnson

562
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,321
knocked out Tommy Byrnes.

563
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:09,076
Oh, yeah, a Negro

564
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,613
was the heavyweight champion of the world.

565
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,531
What happened
the very next day?

566
00:27:18,586 --> 00:27:20,504
They went out looking for

567
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,172
the great white hope...

568
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,210
to take back the title.

569
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,018
There were race riots in
Springfield, Illinois,

570
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,769
the home of Abraham Lincoln.

571
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:43,811
89 Negroes...
were lynched that year.

To qualify for
conscientious objector status,

574
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,467
you have to satisfy
3 basic requirements.

575
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:09,219
We know what they are.
I shall quote them.

576
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:13,640
One, you must be conscientiously
opposed to war in any form.

577
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:16,009
Two, your opposition
must be based on

578
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,961
religious training and belief.

579
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:21,565
Three, you must show
your objection is sincere.

Hmm? No need to shout, Warren.

I'm listening.

584
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,526
Gentlemen, I'm wondering if,
in the future, we might not

585
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,111
end these sessions
a bit earlier.

586
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,196
Well, we can hardly get through the case load as it is.

587
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,498
It doesn't make much sense.

588
00:28:37,532 --> 00:28:40,417
Hugo is 83 years old.
He's not in the best of health.

I may be slowing up,
but I am not dead yet.

Yeah, Brennan won't
let them out

594
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,550
until they hear the Ali case.

595
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,802
You'll see-- 5 votes to 3, they'll hear it.

00:28:58,836 --> 00:29:02,473
Really?
5 votes to 3, they won't.

Anybody? Come on.

It's 5 to 3, they won't.
Here you go.

6 votes to two, they won't.

You're an idiot, Scott.

601
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,517
Brennan, Black, and Douglas

602
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:14,902
are gonna vote
to hear the case.

603
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,621
You're right.
OK, 5 votes to 3 for Ali.

You can't flip your bet, man.

Come on.
You already gave me your money.

All right, it's a squeaker.

607

But 4 votes to hear the case,

608

Brennan, Black, and Douglas,

609
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:29,366
and I got a hunch Stewart's gonna vote with them.

610
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:31,168
I got a hunch he won't.

611
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:33,203
To file for conscientious objector status,

612
00:29:33,221 --> 00:29:34,221
you have to be a member of

613
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:36,306
an organized religion or sect.

614
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:40,928
The Nation of Islam?
What is that?

615
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,347
Let's just take the vote and move on, please.

616
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,182
Look, I know where
most of you stand.

617
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:48,018
I don't expect the Court to find for Ali,

618
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,069
but at the very least,

619
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:51,405
I think we should
grant a hearing.

620
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:52,940
If we imprison

621
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,576
such a high-profile
war dissenter

622
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,578
without granting him
the full protection

623
00:29:57,612 --> 00:29:59,580
of the legal process,

624
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:00,998
it could be seen
that the government

625
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:03,333
prosecuted the case
on a political basis.

626
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,734
Stuff and nonsense.

627
00:30:04,752 --> 00:30:06,503
Say what, Chief?
BURGER: Bill?

628
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,755
You know my position.

629
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,959
If the Court won't rule on the legality of the war,

630
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,045
let's at least
rule on this case.

631
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,597
BRENNAN:
At least two.

632
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:18,015
BURGER:
Harry?

633
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,684
This is a very complex case.

634
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:23,437
Does Ali satisfy the 3 tenets

635
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:25,556
of conscientious
objector status?

636
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,024
I need more time
to look at this.

637
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,225
Oh, for God's sake.

638
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,694
Harry, you can't agonize over this any longer.

639
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,729
You just have to vote.

640
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:34,781
If you insist, but you're bullying me into this.

641
00:30:34,816 --> 00:30:37,484
On the face of it, I don't think Ali has a case.

642
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:39,987
BURGER: Byron?

643
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:42,155
I agree with the Chief.

644
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,441
This case is
a waste of our time.

645
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:46,577
I don't even know why we're discussing it.

646
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:47,711

647
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,215
Hugo?

648
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:53,250
I was against World War II

649
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,618
until Pearl Harbor,

650
00:30:54,636 --> 00:30:56,953
against the Korean
War start to finish,

651
00:30:56,971 --> 00:30:59,756
and against the Vietnam war from the start.

652
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,291
A waste. A mistake.

653
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:03,727
We're paying a high
price for that.

654
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:05,679
Hugo, what is your vote?

655
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,764
We should hear the case,
goddamn it.

656
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:09,633
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

657
00:31:09,651 --> 00:31:11,101
BRENNAN: That's 3.

658
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:14,804
Potter?

659
00:31:14,822 --> 00:31:17,107
I think Ali should
get his day in court.

660
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,158
I vote to grant.

661
00:31:18,192 --> 00:31:23,247
And 4. Ha!
No one wants to hear the case, huh?

662
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,865
You got that one wrong, Chief.

663
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,650
HARLAN: Well, all this
wouldn't have happened

664
00:31:26,668 --> 00:31:30,254
if the petitioner
had not been Muhammad Ali.

665
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,289
That's right.
We are hearing the case

666
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:35,375
because the petitioner is Muhammad Ali.

667
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:40,547
¶

668
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,718
4-4.

669
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:45,686
What'd he say?

670
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,857
¶

671
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,312
All right, gentlemen,
you've got your 4 votes.

672
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:56,730
The case will be heard.

673
00:31:57,865 --> 00:31:59,283
But it takes 5 to overturn.

674
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,118
Yeah, where's that fifth vote coming from?

675
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,686
Justice, Sir.
Good afternoon, sir.

676
00:32:02,704 --> 00:32:07,857
¶

677
00:32:09,043 --> 00:32:11,044
CLERK: Sir? What was
the vote on Ali?

678
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,529
We're going to hear the case,

679
00:32:12,547 --> 00:32:14,197
Lord only knows why.

680
00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:17,200
Bill Brennan's doing.
He politics his way around everything.

681
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,304
On Phillips vs. Marietta,

682
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,506
I want you to draft an opinion

683
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,891
that under
the Civil Rights Act,

684
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:28,261
an employer may not, in the
absence of business necessity,

685
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:31,598
refuse to hire a woman with
children of pre-school age.

686
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:34,101
Sir, that's not what you
told us before conference.

687
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,819
You said the employer
was within his rights

688
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:37,053
not to hire the woman.

689
00:32:37,071 --> 00:32:38,071
You said you were upholding.

690
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:40,490
That was a tentative vote.

691
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,559
Petrus, did you get hold
of the court plans?

692
00:32:42,577 --> 00:32:44,745
They're on your desk, sir.
Thank you.

693
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,449
He just changed his vote, just like that?

694
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,702
There's no mileage in voting with the minority.

695
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:53,120
If he votes with
the majority, he gets

696
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:56,039
to assign the opinion,
or write it himself.

697
00:32:56,073 --> 00:32:57,574
Complaining about Bill Brennan.

698
00:32:57,592 --> 00:32:58,592
He's got a nerve.

699
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:00,510
Chief is always
pulling the strings.

700
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,295
Do not underestimate him.

701
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:06,383
Hold all my calls, please.

702

703
00:33:20,314 --> 00:33:21,948
HARLAN:
It's Friday night.

704
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:25,786
Why aren't you at
home with your wife?

705
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,155
Oh, she's used to it, sir.

706
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:29,740
I just need to catch
up a little bit.

707
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,325
No, no. This is important.

708
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:33,960
You must take every
moment you can.

709
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,664
Pack up.
I'll give you a ride home.

710
00:33:40,134 --> 00:33:42,252
[Horns honking]

711
00:33:46,474 --> 00:33:48,225
Sir, would you
like me to drive?

712
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:52,312
New lenses.
It takes a while to adjust.

713
00:33:52,346 --> 00:33:54,731
You and Donna free
on Sunday for lunch?

714
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:57,517
[Tires screech]

715
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,469
Sir, please let me drive.

716
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:01,354
12:30 or 1 suit you?

717
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:04,908
That sounds nice.

718
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:10,080
¶

719
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:17,287
Thank you. Uhh.

720
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,989
This is nice.

721
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,011
Hello.
HOUSEKEEPER: Good afternoon.

722
00:34:25,046 --> 00:34:26,680
HARLAN: How are you
settling in?

723
00:34:26,714 --> 00:34:28,932
Fine, sir, thank you.

724
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:31,885
I'm enjoying DC. I have a dog.

725
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,804
He's good company. Ha ha!

726
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,171
DONNA: We're going
on lots of walks.

727
00:34:35,189 --> 00:34:37,941
Oh, I know the hours are long.
It's hard.

728
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,193
Here you go, ma'am.

729
00:34:41,062 --> 00:34:42,646
Oh, why, thank you, dear.

730
00:34:47,368 --> 00:34:48,985
How long have you
been married, sir?

731
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:51,020
Hmm? 43 years.

732
00:34:51,038 --> 00:34:52,322
Wow.

733
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:55,191
When I first met Ethel, she was married to somebody else.

734
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:57,077
But I stole her away from him.

735
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,995
[Laughter]

736
00:34:59,029 --> 00:35:00,247
Am I right, dear?

737
00:35:01,716 --> 00:35:03,967
We planned to have
the wedding at

738
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:06,470
Ethel's aunt's house
in Waterbury.

739
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,204
It was Hartford, John.

740
00:35:08,222 --> 00:35:11,808
Hartford.
You're absolutely right, my love.

741
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:13,677
But on the day,
the aunt fell ill,

742
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,095
so we had to switch
the ceremony

743
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,680
to the First
Congregational Church

744
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,715
in... where was it?

745
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:23,904
Farmington. Right.
That's right.

746
00:35:23,938 --> 00:35:26,990
Well, at the last minute,
I suddenly realized

747
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:29,726
that the marriage
license was invalid

748
00:35:29,744 --> 00:35:32,329
outside the Hartford
city limits.

749
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,948
So, we met in Hartford

750
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,566
for an early-morning wedding

751
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:38,335
and returned to Farmington

752
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,086
for an early afternoon wedding.

753
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:41,237
[Laughter]

754
00:35:41,255 --> 00:35:43,373
Well, as ever, sir,
another testament

755
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:45,091
to your devotion
to both the spirit

756
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:47,127
and the letter of the law.

757
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,597
Happiest day of my life.

758
00:35:50,631 --> 00:35:53,884
I...perhaps I should get ready.

759
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,886
We have guests for
cocktails, don't we?

760
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,804
No, no, not today. Not today.

761
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:58,939
Oh.

762
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,092
Silly me.

763
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,594
Silly you.

764
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,097
Kevin, after lunch,

765
00:36:08,115 --> 00:36:09,265
I'd like to take a quick look

766
00:36:09,283 --> 00:36:11,117
at Coolidge v. New Hampshire,

767
00:36:11,152 --> 00:36:12,319
if you wouldn't mind.

768
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,486
Of course.

769
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,705
Won't keep him long. Promise.

773
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,842

Give me a minute, please.

Ah, yeah, that's better. Ahh.

Um, would you like me to read for you, sir?

777
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:55,161
Yes, yes, that--that would be helpful, Kevin.
Thank you.

810
00:38:08,903 --> 00:38:11,354
People see this, they see
other athletes and entertainers

811
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:15,391
getting by on little excuses,
and I know I'm sincere.

812
00:38:15,409 --> 00:38:18,194
But now I get a heavy penalty
to the white preachers

813
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:21,731
that break in the government
house, burn up the draft card,

814
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:23,233
hang statutes of the President,

815
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:27,103
lay on the Pentagon steps,
leave America white citizens.

816
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,139
But I'm the bad one now,
the poor slave.

817
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:30,290
Now I'm the bad one.

818
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:33,593
COURT MARSHAL: All rise.

819
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,214
The honorable,
the Chief Justice,

820
00:38:38,248 --> 00:38:40,800
and the Associate Justices
of the Supreme Court

821
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:43,053
of the United States.

822
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:46,272
Oyez, oyez, oyez.

823
00:38:46,307 --> 00:38:48,257
All persons having business

824
00:38:48,275 --> 00:38:51,227
before the Honorable,
the Supreme Court of the United States,

825
00:38:51,261 --> 00:38:53,863
are admonished to draw near
and give their attention

826
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,432
for the Court is now sitting.

827
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:59,736
God save the United States
and the Honorable Court.

828
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:07,160
Docket number 2-9-9,
Cohen versus California.

829
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:14,084
BURGER:
Mr. Nimmer, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

830
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,802
The Court is thoroughly aware

831
00:39:15,836 --> 00:39:16,970
of the facts of this case.

832
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:19,305
It will not be necessary
to dwell on them.

833
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,758
At Mr. Chief Justice's
suggestion,

834
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,309
I certainly will
keep very brief

835
00:39:23,344 --> 00:39:25,145
the statement of facts.

836
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:27,147
What this young man did
was to walk through

837
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:29,682
a courthouse corridor
wearing a jacket

838
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,101
inscribed with the words--

839
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,636
Mr. Nimmer, we agreed, it is not necessary "Fuck the Draft."

840
00:39:33,654 --> 00:39:35,688
to dwell on the facts.

841
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,641
I suggest we avoid
using that word

842
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:40,660
for the rest of oral argument,

843
00:39:40,694 --> 00:39:44,480
and we simply refer
to it as... "that word."

844
00:39:44,498 --> 00:39:46,916
Yes, your honor.
MAN: The Court should rule on the war.

845
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:50,086
We are arguing that
the State may not,

846
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,922
consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments,

847
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,657
make the simple
public display...

848
00:39:54,675 --> 00:39:56,176
Every day in Vietnam,

849
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,762
young American men are killed

850
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,680
because this country
refuses to admit

851
00:40:00,714 --> 00:40:01,848
that we've made a mistake.

852
00:40:01,882 --> 00:40:03,499
POLICE OFFICER: Let's go.
Who wants to be

853
00:40:03,517 --> 00:40:06,502
the last person to die for a mistake?

854
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,004
POLICE OFFICER: That's enough.
This Court should rule

855
00:40:08,055 --> 00:40:09,472
on the war!

856
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:10,940
This Court should rule...

857
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,977
Well, people bring
passion to politics,

858
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:16,529
and vulgarity is
simply a side effect

859
00:40:16,564 --> 00:40:19,182
of a free exchange of ideas.

860
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,349
Calm down.

861
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:23,369
Get out.

862
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:27,624
He's right.
The Court should rule on the war.

863
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:30,043
Oh, Bill, you've been singing that song since '66.

864
00:40:30,077 --> 00:40:32,245
Yes, and I'll go on
singing it, Whizzer.

865
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:35,081
Bill, please. My name is Byron.

866
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,699
This is not a war
that's making the world

867
00:40:36,717 --> 00:40:37,717
safe for democracy.

868
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:39,035
It's a war of aggression.

869
00:40:39,053 --> 00:40:40,170
It is up to Congress

870
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,971
to challenge the
war, not the Court.

871
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,206
It's up to the Court to decide

872
00:40:43,224 --> 00:40:46,893
the constitutionality
of it, Byron.

873
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:49,012
If I was still in the Senate,

874
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:50,713
I would lead the charge!

875
00:40:50,731 --> 00:41:05,662

NIXON: They're trying
to say that they want peace.

877
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:13,419
They're trying to say that
they want to stop the killing.

878
00:41:13,454 --> 00:41:16,756
They're trying to say that
they want to end the draft.

879
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:20,743
They're trying to say that we
ought to get out of Vietnam.

880
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:25,181
I agree with everything that
they're trying to accomplish.

881

[Intercom buzzes]

883
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:36,592
Yes?
JANET: It's the White House, sir.

884
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:39,312
Thank you, Janet.
You can put the call through, please.

885
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:49,239
Who's acting for the vets?
Is it Ramsey Clark?

886
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,440
I believe so, sir.

887
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:52,959
Get Ramsey Clark on the phone,

888
00:41:52,993 --> 00:41:55,128
and the Solicitor General as well.
Yes, sir.

889
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:06,956
There is a real danger
to security, Chief.

890
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:10,977
The anti-war protestors
have advertised plans

891
00:42:11,011 --> 00:42:12,795
to shut down the city.

892
00:42:12,813 --> 00:42:15,265
"Advertised plans?"

893
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:16,849
The government has no business

894
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:20,403
anticipating unlawful conduct.

895
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,138
The Justice Department is seeking a re-instatement

896
00:42:22,156 --> 00:42:24,490
of the lower court order

897
00:42:24,525 --> 00:42:26,826
to prevent the Vets from camping on the Mall at night.

898
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,995
Well, the Appeals Court
rule they can stay--

899
00:42:29,029 --> 00:42:31,781
This is the Supreme Court,
Mr. Clark,

900
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:34,167
and if the United States
government

901
00:42:34,201 --> 00:42:36,485
believes there's
a danger to security,

902
00:42:36,503 --> 00:42:38,454
I will have no choice
but to reinstate

903
00:42:38,488 --> 00:42:39,706
the lower court order.

904
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:41,791
The city won't grant
them a permit

905
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,176
to camp anywhere else.

906
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:46,629
You'll be evicting
a peaceful group

907
00:42:46,663 --> 00:42:48,965
before their protest is over.

908
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:50,883
Well, due to
the lateness of the hour,

909
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:55,238
I believe the order won't
be instated until tomorrow.

910
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:56,539
Sir, first thing
in the morning,

911
00:42:56,574 --> 00:43:00,193
I will appeal the decision to the full Court.

912
00:43:00,227 --> 00:43:03,012
I'm not sure the other Justices

913
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,513
will support you.

914
00:43:04,531 --> 00:43:08,284
Well, that remains to be seen,
Mr. Clark.

915
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:13,456
¶

916
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:44,854
BURGER: I drove past
on my way here.

917
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,907
There are thousands of them
camped out there.

918
00:43:47,941 --> 00:43:50,576
Oh, Warren, they are veterans against the war.

919
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:52,395
Men and women who fought for their country.

920
00:43:52,413 --> 00:43:56,032
There is chaos, John.
Police barricades.

921
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:58,584
Traffic is stalled all the way up Pennsylvania Avenue.

922
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:00,703
It's as if the entire
city is under siege.

923
00:44:00,737 --> 00:44:01,754
They were in Court today.

924
00:44:01,789 --> 00:44:04,290
Tomorrow, they could
be in Chambers!

925
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:05,625
Tonight, I had to reinstate

926
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,260
the lower court order
to evict them.

927
00:44:07,294 --> 00:44:08,911
You shouldn't have acted alone.

928
00:44:08,929 --> 00:44:10,797
It was an emergency petition.

929
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:13,016
The president is
very concerned.

930
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,550
Excuse me, did I
hear you right?

931
00:44:14,584 --> 00:44:16,019
You spoke to the president?

932
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,970
I speak to him often.
He's a good friend.

933
00:44:19,473 --> 00:44:21,724
A Justice should be wholly removed from politics.

934
00:44:21,758 --> 00:44:24,260
I don't even vote in
Presidential elections.

935
00:44:24,278 --> 00:44:25,978
First thing tomorrow,
Ramsey Clark

936
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,097
will appeal my ruling
to the full Court

937
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:30,817
and I don't wish
to be overruled, John.

938
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:33,319
In 20 years, that has
only happened once.

939
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:36,122
Now, I need you.
I depend upon you

940
00:44:36,156 --> 00:44:37,373
to talk to the others.

941
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,775
Bill Brennan,
Thurgood in particular.

942
00:44:39,793 --> 00:44:41,277
Bill Douglas.

943
00:44:41,295 --> 00:44:44,714
The decision must be unanimous.

944
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:48,551
It is essential to both
the Court and the Nation

945
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:51,721
that we all
come aboard on this.

946
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,423
I would appreciate it, John.

947
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:58,177
¶

948
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,730
John, the Chief's order

949
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,798
is a breach of
the First Amendment.

950
00:45:02,816 --> 00:45:06,102
BRENNAN: Government's trying
to govern by court injunctions.

951
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:09,605
We're being asked to do
Nixon's dirty work.

952
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:12,308
MARSHALL:
The Chief should've gone into politics.

953
00:45:12,326 --> 00:45:14,744
That's his true calling, not the law.

954
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:17,113
Yeah, just like Bill Brennan.

955
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:19,165
Hugo, please.

956
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:21,650
HARLAN: I think you all
malign the Chief unfairly.

957
00:45:21,668 --> 00:45:24,170
Since his appointment,
debate in conference

958
00:45:24,204 --> 00:45:26,589
has been more open, much freer

959
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:29,342
than it ever was
under his predecessor.

960
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:31,594
You can't argue with that.

961
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:33,346
I know this is not ideal

962
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,498
and normally we have
the luxury of time

963
00:45:35,549 --> 00:45:39,769
but this was
an emergency petition.

964
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,854
And there's no point
in conflict.

965
00:45:41,889 --> 00:45:43,973
You just get locked.

966
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:46,008
I'm with you, John.

967
00:45:46,026 --> 00:45:47,643
To overrule the Chief would be

968
00:45:47,677 --> 00:45:50,530

00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:18,537
on behalf of Muslims,"

1127
00:54:18,571 --> 00:54:21,624
that is what is known as
participating in

1128
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:23,075
a holy war, is it not?

1129
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:25,127
It is, Mr. Justice, yes.

1130
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:26,829
And that is in the Quran.

1131
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:28,697
Yes, sir. It's also referenced

1132
00:54:28,715 --> 00:54:30,365
in Elijah Muhammad's book.

1133
00:54:30,383 --> 00:54:31,884
So, he would fight?

1134
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:38,223
Uh, ahem. Sir, Black Muslims

1135
00:54:38,258 --> 00:54:41,393
have taken some of their
beliefs from the Quran

1136
00:54:41,428 --> 00:54:44,013
and fashioned them
to the black man's

1137
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:46,682
experience in
the United States.

1138
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:48,183
BLACK:
In this holy war,

1139
00:54:48,217 --> 00:54:51,020
who would your client
be fighting?

1140
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:53,405
Sir, nowhere in the record

1141
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,407
has my client ever said

1142
00:54:55,442 --> 00:54:59,194
that he would
fight with weapons

1143
00:54:59,228 --> 00:55:01,947
against anybody.

1144
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:03,615
STEWART: Mr. Griswold,

1145
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:06,568
the Hearing Officer,
Judge Grauman,

1146
00:55:06,586 --> 00:55:08,170
recommended that Mr. Ali's

1147
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:11,790
conscientious objector
status be sustained.

1148
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:15,177
Why did the government choose
to ignore his findings?

1149
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:17,262
As your honors know,
the government is not

1150
00:55:17,297 --> 00:55:19,798
represented at such hearings.

1151
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,884
Well, what I'm
interested in learning

1152
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,802
is why
the government determined

1153
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:26,555
that Ali's beliefs were
not religiously rooted.

1154
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:27,773
We accept that his beliefs

1155
00:55:27,807 --> 00:55:29,725
are religiously rooted.

1156
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:33,428
You accept that his beliefs
are religiously rooted?

1157
00:55:33,446 --> 00:55:34,697
Yes, Your Honor, we do.

1158
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,732
But you question his sincerity.

1159
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:39,267
We do not question
his sincerity.

1160
00:55:39,285 --> 00:55:41,320
BRENNAN: You don't
question his sincerity?

1161
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:42,871
No, Mr. Justice, we do not.

1162
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:45,824
Mr. Griswold, what is
the government's objection?

1163
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,826
Sir, the only question
before the Court now

1164
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:51,296
is that his objection
was selective.

1165
00:55:51,331 --> 00:55:54,967
It is not enough for his objection to be religious;

1166
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:57,386
it must also be an objection

1167
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:01,123
to participation
in wars in any form.

1168
00:56:01,141 --> 00:56:01,974
The Petitioner
just doesn't want

1169
00:56:02,008 --> 00:56:04,226
to fight the white man's wars,

1170
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,812
and I can understand that.

1171
00:56:06,846 --> 00:56:07,930
At the same time, he has no

1172
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:10,349
religious or conscientious scruples against

1173
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,184
participation in wars which would defend

1174
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:13,819
the black man's interests.

1175
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:19,141
In this summary
of the first hearing,

1176
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:21,110
"Clay objects to being
in service because

1177
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:22,978
he has no quarrel
with the Vietcong."

1178
00:56:22,996 --> 00:56:24,947
In his own words, quote,

1179
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:29,785
"No Vietcong ever called
me nigger," unquote.

1180
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:35,124
Since Mr. Ali would participate in a holy war,

1181
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:39,595
he is not a true
conscientious objector.

1182
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:43,298
HARLAN: Mr. Eskridge,
people have always

1183
00:56:43,332 --> 00:56:46,218
fought wars for
religious reasons,

1184
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:49,471
and then would defend them
as being holy wars,

1185
00:56:49,505 --> 00:56:51,023
"just" as opposed to "unjust."

1186
00:56:51,057 --> 00:56:52,775
Like the Crusades.

1187
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:57,679
So, your client would
fight a holy war but--

1188
00:56:57,697 --> 00:56:59,448
and I'm quoting you here--

1189
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:04,236
"wouldn't fight with weapons
against anybody."

1190
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:06,688
I'm sorry. I'm confused.

1191
00:57:11,244 --> 00:57:13,361
How do you stand now with

1192
00:57:13,379 --> 00:57:15,297
the possibility of
going to jail?

1193
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:17,499
Oh, I don't know.
I'm just waiting any day now.

1194
00:57:17,533 --> 00:57:18,584
Do you think
about that, though?

1195
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:19,501
Do you ever think
what you'll do

1196
00:57:19,535 --> 00:57:20,919
or if you do go?

1197
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,005
Why, yes, you think about it at nights
when you're in the bed.

1198
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,040
You think about, you know,
if I went this way,

1199
00:57:25,058 --> 00:57:26,875
what could have happened,
if I went this way,

1200
00:57:26,893 --> 00:57:28,376
and I've figured it all out.

1201
00:57:28,394 --> 00:57:30,562
But whenever people want
to really make progress,

1202
00:57:30,597 --> 00:57:32,564
some have to sacrifice a lot,

1203
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:36,051
and I like to say
white America right now

1204
00:57:36,069 --> 00:57:38,220
spending $30 million
a day in Asia,

1205
00:57:38,238 --> 00:57:40,889
black and white boys are
dying unjustly for nothing

1206
00:57:40,907 --> 00:57:42,825
just to free somebody else.

1207
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:45,360
So, why should I worry about
going to little old jail

1208
00:57:45,394 --> 00:57:46,995
to free my poor people
who's been

1209
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,447
catching all hell
for 400 years.

1210
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:50,899
[Applause]

1211
00:57:50,917 --> 00:57:52,901
BURGER: Gentlemen, let's
take the vote. John?

1212
00:57:56,923 --> 00:57:58,590
I uphold his conviction.

1213
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:01,793
Uphold.

1214
00:58:04,097 --> 00:58:05,247
Free the man.

1215
00:58:06,432 --> 00:58:07,549
Uphold.

1216
00:58:08,968 --> 00:58:11,470
Oh, let's free the man,
for God's sake.

1217
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:13,105
BURGER: Potter:

1218
00:58:13,139 --> 00:58:15,090
I'm with Bill and Bill.
Go free.

1219
00:58:15,108 --> 00:58:16,258
BURGER: Harry?

1220
00:58:16,276 --> 00:58:17,442
Uphold.

1221
00:58:17,477 --> 00:58:20,195
I vote to uphold.
That's decided.

1222
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:23,282
As the senior Justice
on the majority side,

1223
00:58:23,316 --> 00:58:26,601
to write the opinion
I assign...

1224
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:34,159
5 to 3 against Ali.
Yes!

1225
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:37,713
John Harlan's been
assigned the opinion.

1226
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:39,248
Come on, boys,
let's go to lunch.

1227
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,550
We can drown our sorrows.

1228
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:43,969
You're welcome
to join us. Yeah.

1229
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,166
[Car horn honks]

1230
00:59:14,483 --> 00:59:17,286
I recommended to a fellow
trustee at the Smithsonian

1231
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,987
that unemployed blacks
be trained

1232
00:59:19,005 --> 00:59:21,323
to work as gardeners
at the Mall.

1233
00:59:21,341 --> 00:59:23,041
I think they'd be wonderful.

1234
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:25,160
They have such
a lovely sense of color.

1235
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:33,385
BRENNAN: Teddy,
Cutty Sark, please.

1236
00:59:35,504 --> 00:59:36,671
Sam, James.

1237
00:59:36,689 --> 00:59:37,839
Thank you, sir.

1238
00:59:37,857 --> 00:59:39,858
Kevin.
Sir?

1239
00:59:39,892 --> 00:59:41,343
Didn't he just
get married again?

1240
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:44,479
BRENNAN:
That won't stop him.

1241
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:46,898
Never does.

1242
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:53,288
Well... gloomy Guses all.

1243
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:55,157
Just bring the whiskey, please.

1244
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:00,412
I'm sorry you're
retiring, John.

1245
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:01,413
I'm going to miss you
on the Court.

1246
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:02,748
Oh, you'll get by, Warren.

1247
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,750
Won't be the same.
You've been a good friend to me.

1248
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:06,051
I can always depend on you.

1249
01:00:06,085 --> 01:00:08,637
Yeah, well, you're very good
at looking after yourself.

1250
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:10,005
You'll find new friends.

1251
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:16,178
Big fight ahead of us.
Roe v. Wade.

1252
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:17,729
Sir, your table is
just being prepared.

1253
01:00:17,764 --> 01:00:18,880
Thank you, Jacques.

1254
01:00:19,899 --> 01:00:21,400
With you gone, I'll probably

1255
01:00:21,434 --> 01:00:23,986
write that opinion myself,

1256
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,189
or maybe I'll give it
to Harry Blackmun.

1257
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:28,573
JACQUES:
Sir, please follow me.

1258
01:00:28,608 --> 01:00:29,741
Go ahead, John.

1259
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:34,162
Well, let's not get despondent.

1260
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:36,665
We have Roe v. Wade coming up.

1261
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:38,400
It's got all the ingredients.

1262
01:00:38,418 --> 01:00:41,569
Sexism. Right-wing fanaticism.

1263
01:00:41,587 --> 01:00:44,790
Misogyny. Race.

1264
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:47,909
It's a blockbuster,
boys. Ha ha ha!

1265
01:00:47,927 --> 01:00:49,577
Michelle!

1266
01:00:49,595 --> 01:00:52,080
One, Ali is sincere
in his objections.

1267
01:00:52,098 --> 01:00:54,516
Two, his position as
a Minister of Islam

1268
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:56,518
gives him the
appropriate credentials

1269
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:58,253
for religious training
and belief.

1270
01:00:58,271 --> 01:01:00,255
But, three,
we are not convinced

1271
01:01:00,273 --> 01:01:02,808
that he is conscientiously
opposed to all wars.

1272
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:04,643
Therefore, he does not qualify

1273
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:06,645
for conscientious
objector status.

1274
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:09,948
Therefore, by a majority
of 5 votes to 3,

1275
01:01:09,982 --> 01:01:12,317
his conviction is upheld.

1276
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:14,953
Kevin, I want you
to write the opinion.

1277
01:01:16,605 --> 01:01:18,657
Uh, no thank you, sir.

1278
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:20,992
No thank you. Wait,
are you recusing yourself?

1279
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:24,112
Uh, no, sir.
I--I don't want to be difficult,

1280
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:26,381
but if it doesn't matter to you,

1281
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,916
I wonder if I could switch with another.

1282
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:30,168
I'd take any case.

He's a properly ordained minister of the Nation of Islam.

not supposed to fight.

What is the problem?
Why are we sending him to jail?

1294

The Jehovah's Witness case?

1312
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:36,595
Yeah. 1955.
The Jehovah's Witnesses

1313
01:03:36,629 --> 01:03:39,130
were granted conscientious
objector status.

1314
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:41,883
They don't have
to go to Vietnam.

1315
01:03:41,917 --> 01:03:44,603
Yeah? So?

1316
01:03:44,637 --> 01:03:46,972
Well, this is what
the Jehovah's Witnesses say.

1317
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:50,442
If God commanded it,
they would fight.

1318
01:03:50,476 --> 01:03:53,761
And these are the words
from Ali's own statement:

1319
01:03:53,779 --> 01:03:55,096
"But the Quran do teach us

1320
01:03:55,114 --> 01:03:56,948
"we do not take part
in any war...

1321
01:03:56,983 --> 01:04:01,152
unless declared
by Allah himself."

1322
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:04,606
I mean, it's clear as day.
Ali, a Black Muslim,

1323
01:04:04,624 --> 01:04:06,074
a follower of Elijah Muhammad,

1324
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:07,542
is saying exactly

1325
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,494
what the Jehovah's
Witnesses are saying.

1326
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:12,914
He would only go to war
if his god commanded it.

1327
01:04:12,948 --> 01:04:15,283
His god. Allah.

1328
01:04:15,301 --> 01:04:17,469
Now, that's not gonna happen.

1329
01:04:17,503 --> 01:04:19,804
That's the same as
the Jehovah's Witnesses.

1330
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:22,390
How can Harlan not buy that?

1331
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:24,926
That's actually not bad.

1332
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,012
Harlan is always
hammering us about

1333
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:29,598
law, reason, precedent.

1334
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:33,301
Well, Sicurella
is the precedent.

1335
01:04:33,319 --> 01:04:35,987
And how can he make a reasoned
distinction between

1336
01:04:36,022 --> 01:04:37,989
The Black Muslims
and the Jehovah's Witnesses?

1337
01:04:38,024 --> 01:04:40,609
He can't. Ali is just the same

1338
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:41,976
as the Jehovah's Witnesses,

1339
01:04:41,994 --> 01:04:44,162
effectively opposed
to all wars.

1340
01:04:46,198 --> 01:04:48,366
Yeah. But you're still
gonna have to find a way

1341
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:52,153
to convince him to take
the Black Muslims

1342
01:04:52,171 --> 01:04:53,171
and their religious views

1343
01:04:53,205 --> 01:04:55,840
and how those views
relate to war seriously.

1344
01:04:57,176 --> 01:05:02,264
One more thing.
However you write it up,

1345
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:04,849
don't give him any reason
to find a political agenda.

1346

1444
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:43,605
Yes, sir.

01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:26,597
Ethel?

1449

Oh, my!

1451

Where do you think
you're going, huh?

1452
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:06,220
It's very late, you know.

1453
01:12:06,254 --> 01:12:07,472
And very chilly.

¶

1457
01:13:02,477 --> 01:13:03,494
Ahh.

1458
01:13:03,529 --> 01:13:05,496
Hiya, Johnny boy.
How you doing?

1459
01:13:05,531 --> 01:13:07,982
I have a little love note
for you this afternoon.

1460
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,250
Ah. Ha.

1461
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:11,035
Morning.
Morning, sir.

1462
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:12,170
Morning, gentlemen.

1463
01:13:30,505 --> 01:13:32,940
Could you ask Kevin Connolly
to come in, please?

1464
01:13:51,043 --> 01:13:52,460
Uh, sit down.

1465
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:55,213
Sir, I wanted
to try and explain.

1466
01:13:55,247 --> 01:13:56,464
Sit down.

1467
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:03,971
Sir, when you hired me,

1468
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:06,174
boy, I was just over the moon.

1469
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:09,543
And it's... it's an honor
and a privilege

1470
01:14:09,561 --> 01:14:11,512
to work in your chambers,

1471
01:14:11,546 --> 01:14:14,015
but I'm starting to feel like,

1472
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:16,150
like I don't belong here and...

1473
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:17,602
Take this down, please.

1474
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:20,855
You ready?

1475
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:22,490
Uh... yes, sir.

1476
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:28,896
Case 7-8-3, Clay, a.k.a. Ali,

1477
01:14:28,914 --> 01:14:30,915
versus United States.

1478
01:14:30,949 --> 01:14:33,034
Dear Chief.

1479
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:38,906
My original conference vote
was to affirm.

1480
01:14:38,924 --> 01:14:42,043
It is on that basis, of course,

1481
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:46,013
that you assigned
the opinion to me.

1482
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:49,183
Subsequent work
on such an opinion

1483
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:52,386
has brought me
serious misgivings.

1484
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:56,474
I now understand
that Black Muslims

1485
01:14:56,525 --> 01:15:00,528
oppose all wars
on religious grounds.

1486
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:04,232
You flipped.

1487
01:15:07,286 --> 01:15:11,038
Sir, are you-- are you changing your vote?

1488
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:13,324
Ahem. Last night,
I took another look

1489
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:14,909
at your original briefing.

1490
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:18,579
I read through
the Elijah Muhammad book

1491
01:15:18,613 --> 01:15:21,215
and yes, I'm changing my vote.

1492
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:25,786
Sir, there's really no need

1493
01:15:25,804 --> 01:15:28,089
for you to read this.

1494
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:32,226
I've--I've changed my mind.

1495
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:34,478
No.

1496
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:37,398
No.

1497
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:40,184
You've changed mine.

1498
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:45,907
And I salute you.

1499
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:53,247
All right. Let's press on.

1500
01:15:55,033 --> 01:16:00,621
The religious doctrine
of Islam states,

1501
01:16:00,655 --> 01:16:03,841
"Our refusal to go armed

1502
01:16:03,875 --> 01:16:06,928
is our proof
that we want peace."

1503
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:09,096
Sir! Sir.

1504
01:16:13,352 --> 01:16:16,387
Uh, "Elijah Muhammad goes on.

1505
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:18,856

1506

1507

01:16:32,404 --> 01:16:35,489

in any wars

1512
01:16:35,523 --> 01:16:38,242
which take the lives
of others."

1513
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:41,162
"In my opinion,
this passage proves

1514
01:16:41,196 --> 01:16:43,798
"that Black Muslims
are legitimately opposed

1515
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:46,751
"to all wars

1516
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:49,170
"And I am now convinced

1517
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:52,539
the conviction
should be reversed."

1518
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:55,893
My God!

1519
01:16:58,764 --> 01:17:00,564
The vote's a tie.

1520
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:11,025
John Harlan has
become an apologist

1521
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:12,777
for the Black Muslims.

1522
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:21,786
John Harlan is
one of the few people

1523
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:24,422
who could convince me
that there is such a thing

1524
01:17:24,456 --> 01:17:26,374
as a good Republican.

1525

1528
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:42,056
BURGER: John,
you have betrayed me.

1529
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:44,191
These are your last
days on the court.

1530
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:46,360
What on Earth
has taken hold of you?

1531
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:47,695
It's Bill Brennan, isn't it?

1532
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:49,697
He's the one who's
been twisting your arm.

1533
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:51,932
Twisting my arm? Really?

1534
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:53,451
Don't you patronize me, John.

1535
01:17:53,485 --> 01:17:58,989
Oh, come on in, Warren, and sit down,
for God's sake. Come on.

1536
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:05,296
Sit, sit.

1537
01:18:08,667 --> 01:18:10,501
Don't think I'm not sensitive

1538
01:18:10,552 --> 01:18:12,420
to how you judge me
sometimes, John.

1539
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:13,471
Now, come on, Warren.

1540
01:18:13,505 --> 01:18:15,423
Now you're making it
a little too personal.

1541
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:16,974
No, I'm not.

1542
01:18:17,008 --> 01:18:18,792
I count on you,
I depend on you.

1543

As my colleague, as my friend.

1544
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:22,096
We have the same values.

1545
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:24,732
We're both working hard toward a united Court.

1546
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:26,233
Yes, well, it occurs to me that

1547
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:28,135
sometimes we, we're inclined

1548
01:18:28,153 --> 01:18:31,188
to slide around the issues

1549
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:32,973
when we wish to achieve
certain results.

1550
01:18:32,991 --> 01:18:34,742
That's the way it's done, John.

1551
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:36,327
I am the Chief Justice

1552
01:18:36,361 --> 01:18:38,145
of the Supreme Court
of the United States.

1553
01:18:38,163 --> 01:18:39,280
It's my role.

1554
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:40,414
I think it's time we left

1555
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:42,083
politics to Congress,
don't you?

1556
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:44,318
Please. You're being so naive.

1557
01:18:44,336 --> 01:18:46,670
Apart from this place,
do you have any sense

1558
01:18:46,705 --> 01:18:48,422
of what goes on
in the real world?

1559
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:50,591
I know exactly what
goes on in the real world.

1560
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:52,093
All the more reason to protect

1561
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:55,012
the independence of the court.

1562
01:18:55,046 --> 01:18:56,964
So naive.

1563
01:18:56,998 --> 01:19:00,017
John, I don't understand
why you're doing this.

1564
01:19:00,051 --> 01:19:02,186
Why? You're
just about to retire.

1565
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:05,973
Because this Court
is a continuing body.

1566
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:08,225
It acknowledges
the Constitution,

1567
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:09,894
the problems of the day,

1568
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:11,345
and tries to reconcile the two,

1569
01:19:11,363 --> 01:19:13,364
and by God I respect that!

1570
01:19:13,398 --> 01:19:15,616
Oh, please.

1571
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:19,954
The vote is tied, 4 to 4,

1572
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:20,905
and it's not as if it's

1573
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:22,406
going to change anything.

1574
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:24,158
And I can assure you
that I am not

1575
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:25,876
going to shift my position,

1576
01:19:25,911 --> 01:19:27,711
and no one on the Court
will either.

1577
01:19:27,746 --> 01:19:29,046
How the hell
can you be so sure?

1578
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,697
It's wilful, John.

1579
01:19:30,715 --> 01:19:33,384
Do you hear me? It's wilful.

1580
01:19:33,418 --> 01:19:34,752
And what's the result?

1581
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:36,253
You're not going
to get another vote.

1582
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:38,255
Ali will still go to jail.

1583
01:19:38,306 --> 01:19:39,807
You've accomplished nothing.

more serious than that?

1606
01:20:55,467 --> 01:20:58,335
He has cancer, Mr. Connolly.

1607
01:21:00,955 --> 01:21:04,141
He's a very private man.

1608
01:21:04,175 --> 01:21:06,143
I would ask you
to respect that.

1609
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:08,679
Yes, ma'am.

1610
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,985
Well, we are 4.

1611
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:17,905
Thurgood has recused himself.

1612
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:19,473
Where is our fifth coming from?

1613
01:21:19,491 --> 01:21:22,693
Chaps, it's not enough
to get the fifth vote.

1614
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:24,194
In this case, the Court

1615
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:27,314
will have to be perceived
as having one voice.

1616
01:21:27,332 --> 01:21:29,833
The vote must be unanimous.

1617
01:21:29,868 --> 01:21:33,037
8-0?
HARLAN: 8-0.

1618
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:34,321
[Chuckles]

1619
01:21:34,339 --> 01:21:35,789
DOUGLAS: Against
the government?

1620
01:21:35,823 --> 01:21:38,592
Jesus, John.
The last time around,

1621
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:40,661
you were trying to get us to back the Chief.

1622
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,464
Potter?

1623
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:46,800
In this situation, I think
we have to really dig deep.

1624
01:21:46,834 --> 01:21:49,186
Find a reason to overturn.

1625
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:51,388
A reason that the others
would come aboard.

1626
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:57,311
You know what this Chief
is going to say.

1627
01:21:57,345 --> 01:21:58,946
If the court frees Ali,

1628
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,230
every black American

1629
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:01,782
will join the Nation of Islam

1630
01:22:01,816 --> 01:22:04,902
so he doesn't have to go
and fight in Vietnam.

1631
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:07,521
Now, that's what
he's going to say.

1632
01:22:07,539 --> 01:22:09,156
Well, got to find
a reason to reverse

1633
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:12,126
without setting a precedent.

1634
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,044
You don't change the law.

1635
01:22:14,079 --> 01:22:17,197
You make the ruling specific to the Ali case.

1636
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:23,036
Well, whatever trick
we come up with,

1637
01:22:23,054 --> 01:22:27,091
it's got to come from
a Republican appointee.

1638
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:29,476
Me or Bill...
they'll mangle us.

1639
01:22:31,096 --> 01:22:33,547
[Laughs]
BRENNAN: John?

1640
01:22:33,565 --> 01:22:36,600
DOUGLAS: John?
[Coughing]

1641
01:22:40,322 --> 01:22:41,572
You OK, Harry?

1642
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:45,776
I know you're
all concerned about

1643
01:22:45,827 --> 01:22:47,745
what you perceive as
my indecisiveness.

1644
01:22:47,779 --> 01:22:49,697
You think I can't
make up my mind.

1645
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:52,166
It's not that. It really isn't.

1646
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,668
It's that the issues
in this case are so grave.

1647
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:56,954
You answer one question,
even tentatively.

1648
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:58,238
You think you're safe and then

1649
01:22:58,256 --> 01:23:00,674
two more questions
appear on the horizon.

1650
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:02,926
As I see it, I can't
make a final judgment

1651
01:23:02,961 --> 01:23:04,745
until all the facts are in,

1652
01:23:04,763 --> 01:23:08,048
until all the arguments
have been analyzed.

1653
01:23:08,082 --> 01:23:10,768
But it's not
a math problem, Harry.

1654
01:23:10,802 --> 01:23:12,603
You want to find out
one answer.

1655
01:23:12,637 --> 01:23:14,054
It doesn't work that way.

1656
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:20,894
SAM: Here he is.
Sorry.

1657
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:23,313
CLERK:
You're up.

1658
01:23:28,653 --> 01:23:31,104
You must be feeling
pleased with yourself.

1659
01:23:31,122 --> 01:23:32,456
SAM:
Leave it alone, Becker.

1660
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:34,158
You crossed the line, Connolly.

1661
01:23:38,963 --> 01:23:40,964
Ask anybody,

1662
01:23:40,999 --> 01:23:42,416
no matter whose
side they're on.

1663
01:23:42,467 --> 01:23:44,134
John Harlan is one of the most respected

1664
01:23:44,169 --> 01:23:46,136
Justices in Supreme
Court history.

1665
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:49,306
Chief Burger humiliating him like that

1666
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:51,341
in front of everybody--

1667
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:53,977
they heard that all the way over on Capitol Hill.

1668
01:23:54,012 --> 01:23:55,962
He didn't humiliate him.
He just changed his mind

1669
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:57,347
and then he stood his ground.

1670
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:59,566
You know he's not
thinking straight.

1671
01:24:00,935 --> 01:24:01,902
Harlan did the right thing.

1672
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:04,354
It's Justice Harlan
to you, prick.

1673
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:09,693
When you go home at night,

1674
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:10,977
did you tell your wife

1675
01:24:10,995 --> 01:24:13,113
how you took advantage of a dying man?

1676
01:24:15,116 --> 01:24:16,250
You know what?

1677
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:18,836
I've wanted to
punch you in the mouth

1678
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:19,986
since I met you.

1679
01:24:20,922 --> 01:24:22,456
KEVIN: Put them up.

1680
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:23,507
You're kidding me.

1681
01:24:23,541 --> 01:24:25,709
I'm not kidding. Put them up.

1682
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,994
Wow.
Now, I'm not gonna tell you again.

1683
01:24:28,012 --> 01:24:30,264
You're making a mistake here.

1684
01:24:30,298 --> 01:24:31,882
In college, I boxed
in the Golden--

[Both grunting]

01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:36,503
[All shouting]

1687
01:24:36,521 --> 01:24:37,604
CLERK: Get off him!

1688
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:38,772
SECOND CLERK:
Hey, break it up!

1689
01:24:55,573 --> 01:24:57,124
STEWART: I've been troubled
by the government's case

1690
01:24:57,158 --> 01:24:59,910
against Ali since
the very beginning.

1691
01:25:01,296 --> 01:25:05,215
That's why I voted to hear
the case in the first place.

1692
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:08,252
Now, last night, my guys
and I, we took a look...

1693
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:09,837
What is there to look at?

1694
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:12,372
There are 3 conditions
that determine

1695
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:15,309
the status of
a conscientious objector.

1696
01:25:15,343 --> 01:25:17,594
The Appeals Board
ruled that Ali

1697
01:25:17,645 --> 01:25:19,146
did not meet any of them.

1698
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:21,682
But the Appeals Board
was not specific, Chief.

1699
01:25:21,716 --> 01:25:24,768
It did not say which
conditions it rejected.

1700
01:25:24,819 --> 01:25:26,153
What's your point?

1701
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:31,191
Griswold challenged Ali
on only one condition.

1702
01:25:31,242 --> 01:25:32,893
He conceded the other two.

1703
01:25:32,911 --> 01:25:36,947
In fact, he said that
he found Ali to be sincere

1704
01:25:37,064 --> 01:25:39,917
and that his objections
were religiously based.

1705
01:25:41,452 --> 01:25:44,171
So, how do we know
that the one condition

1706
01:25:44,205 --> 01:25:45,589
that Griswold singled out

1707
01:25:45,623 --> 01:25:47,574
was the same one
that the Appeal Board

1708
01:25:47,592 --> 01:25:50,043
used to hang Ali out to dry?

1709
01:25:50,077 --> 01:25:52,296
We don't.
The Appeal Board said nothing.

1710
01:25:52,347 --> 01:25:56,600
They gave no reasons.
It's an error of the law.

1711
01:25:56,634 --> 01:25:58,552
We have no choice
but to overturn.

1712
01:25:58,586 --> 01:25:59,720
I know what
you're doing, Potter.

1713
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:02,088
You're trying to hang this
on a technicality.

1714
01:26:02,106 --> 01:26:03,774
Yes, a technicality,
Chief, exactly.

1715
01:26:03,808 --> 01:26:05,526
That way we can
avoid a precedent

1716
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:08,028
and we can make the ruling
specific to the Ali case.

1717
01:26:08,062 --> 01:26:09,930
BURGER: This is
absolute nonsense.

1718
01:26:09,948 --> 01:26:12,149
If we do what
you're suggesting,

1719
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,650
then a man who refuses

1720
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:16,620
to fight for his country
on dubious grounds

1721
01:26:16,654 --> 01:26:18,405
will still go free.

1722
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:21,408
His belief's a matter
of conscience, Warren.

1723
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:22,876
Protected by
the First Amendment.

1724
01:26:24,963 --> 01:26:27,414
Byron, Hugo, Potter, and John

1725
01:26:27,448 --> 01:26:30,217
are all military men,
and so are you, Bill.

1726
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:31,952
Do you know what this means?

1727
01:26:31,970 --> 01:26:35,172
Yes. Yes, it means there'll
be no more soldiers

1728
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:38,225
left to fight
Nixon's dirty war.

1729
01:26:38,259 --> 01:26:39,309
DOUGLAS: That's
one way to end it.

1730
01:26:39,344 --> 01:26:41,228
Ha ha ha!

1731
01:26:41,262 --> 01:26:42,763
Well, guys, we're
losing focus here.

1732
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:44,631
We're not ruling on the war,

1733
01:26:44,649 --> 01:26:46,400
we don't want
to set a precedent,

1734
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:49,135
we're making this case
specific to Ali.

1735
01:26:49,153 --> 01:26:52,105
Byron, you don't agree
with this, surely.

1736
01:26:52,139 --> 01:26:57,444
Well, Chief,
I have to say, uh...

1737
01:26:57,478 --> 01:26:59,529
I think Potter's
on to something here.

1738
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:05,702
Hugo?

1739
01:27:05,753 --> 01:27:08,005
As long as
there's no precedent.

1740
01:27:08,039 --> 01:27:12,342
¶

1741
01:27:12,377 --> 01:27:13,493
Well...

1742
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:18,799
Harry, it looks as if
you and I are outnumbered.

1743
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:24,721
¶

1744
01:27:24,772 --> 01:27:27,557
I've explored this thoroughly, Chief.
I really have.

1745
01:27:27,609 --> 01:27:29,726
I looked at the arguments,

1746
01:27:29,777 --> 01:27:31,862
I listenedto what everybody had to say,

1747
01:27:31,896 --> 01:27:34,731
and I'm gonna vote
with the majority.

1748
01:27:34,782 --> 01:27:37,818
I believe that the judgment should be reversed

1749
01:27:37,852 --> 01:27:39,236
and Ali should be set free.

1750
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:44,408
¶

1751
01:27:48,463 --> 01:27:52,866
BURGER: Well. It seems
as if I am isolated.

1752
01:27:52,884 --> 01:27:55,419
Ah, look here.

1753
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:58,138
The Constitution
says quite simply

1754
01:27:58,172 --> 01:28:02,592
that you cannot favor
one religion over another.

1755
01:28:02,644 --> 01:28:05,062
Now, how can you make
a legal distinction

1756
01:28:05,096 --> 01:28:08,598
between Jehovah's Witnesses
and Black Muslims?

1757
01:28:10,351 --> 01:28:13,053
The only difference--
Black Muslims are black.

1758
01:28:14,405 --> 01:28:17,157
And that's why
they went after Ali.

1759
01:28:17,191 --> 01:28:20,577
And if that's not a racist
and political conviction,

1760
01:28:20,611 --> 01:28:22,162
I don't know what is.

1761
01:28:22,196 --> 01:28:26,867
If this court
sends Ali to jail,

1762
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:28,234
it is in effect saying there's

1763
01:28:28,252 --> 01:28:30,620
one law for whites
and one law for blacks.

1764
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:37,243
If you dissent, Chief,
it might be interpreted

1765
01:28:37,261 --> 01:28:38,929
as a racist vote.

1766
01:28:41,099 --> 01:28:42,049
What?

1767
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:43,850
HARLAN: You know,
you once said to me

1768
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:45,519
that it was essential

1769
01:28:45,553 --> 01:28:48,271
for both the Court
and the nation

1770
01:28:48,306 --> 01:28:50,607
that everyone comes on board.

1771
01:28:50,641 --> 01:28:54,695
Your words, Chief,
and you were right.

1772
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:56,363
Nobody wants a divided court.

1773
01:28:58,599 --> 01:29:00,984
The opinion is fine, Warren.

1774
01:29:02,737 --> 01:29:06,623
Please, let it go.

1775
01:29:06,657 --> 01:29:11,795
¶

1776
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:24,841
Well, I suppose an 8-0 decision

1777
01:29:24,892 --> 01:29:27,394
would be a good lift
for the black people.

Chaps, come on, chaps...

1783
01:29:58,993 --> 01:30:00,343
I know it's a tad early,

1784
01:30:00,378 --> 01:30:04,381
but it's never too early
for a good old hoot.

1785
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:06,600
Rebel Yell.
Does that appeal to you?

1786
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:07,500
First time for everything, sir.

1787
01:30:07,518 --> 01:30:09,553
It's my favorite. My favorite.

1788
01:30:09,604 --> 01:30:11,438
What happened to you?

1789
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:13,190
War wounds, sir.

1790
01:30:13,224 --> 01:30:22,232
What? Oh, my God.
[Laughs, coughs]

1791
01:30:22,283 --> 01:30:25,819
MAN: Contrary to his usual form,
Muhammad Ali seemed subdued

1792
01:30:25,853 --> 01:30:28,371
as he arrived at the south side
gym for a workout.

1793
01:30:28,406 --> 01:30:29,539
A Black Muslim, he thanked

1794
01:30:29,574 --> 01:30:31,691
Allah and the Court
for his good fortune

1795
01:30:31,709 --> 01:30:34,377
and told them how
he got the news.

1796
01:30:34,412 --> 01:30:36,296
I was on 79th street
on the south side

1797
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:38,248
and just bought my orange
in a grocery store

1798
01:30:38,299 --> 01:30:41,034
and the grocery owner
came out and grabbed me,

1799
01:30:41,052 --> 01:30:42,803
and hugged me
with tears in his eyes.

1800
01:30:42,837 --> 01:30:44,387
Little black fella, and told me

1801
01:30:44,422 --> 01:30:46,840
that you've just been vindicated
and you free,

1802
01:30:46,874 --> 01:30:49,042
8 judges all voted
in your favor,

1803
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:52,179
and he just hugged me
and squeezed me

1804
01:30:52,213 --> 01:30:54,147
and he was this short...

1805
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:05,108
I'm on my way, Mrs. Paige.

1806
01:31:05,159 --> 01:31:07,611
Good night, sir.
Good night.

1808
01:31:24,428 --> 01:31:27,264
MAN: When the Supreme Court
eventually decided

1809
01:31:27,298 --> 01:31:30,100
that you were right and you had a perfect right to do this,

1810
01:31:30,134 --> 01:31:33,303
you showed no resentment
against the men

1811
01:31:33,354 --> 01:31:35,605
who had kept you
away from boxing.

1812
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:36,923
You were very quiet about it.

1813
01:31:36,941 --> 01:31:38,424
Then I would be
a hypocrite if I did

1814
01:31:38,442 --> 01:31:41,811
because I expected
them to recognize

1815
01:31:41,863 --> 01:31:44,981
me for what I believed.

1816
01:31:45,032 --> 01:31:47,450
And they did what they thought
was right at the time.

1817
01:31:47,485 --> 01:31:49,602
They took my title.
At the time,

1818
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:51,938
they wouldn't let me box
nowhere in the country.

1819
01:31:51,956 --> 01:31:54,241
They just did what
they thought was right.

1820
01:31:54,275 --> 01:31:57,577
And for me to now to sue them,
or to condemn them,

1821
01:31:57,611 --> 01:31:59,329
or to speak out against them

1822
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:02,299
for doing what
they thought was right,

1823
01:32:02,333 --> 01:32:04,251
then this would be hypocritical.

1824
01:32:04,285 --> 01:32:06,136
So, how can I get
on them for doing

1825
01:32:06,170 --> 01:32:07,637
what they really
believed was right?

Muhammad Ali is the winner.

He's done it.
