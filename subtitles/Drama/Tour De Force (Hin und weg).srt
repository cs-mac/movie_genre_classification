Stage 13 of the Tour de France,

quite possibly
the most difficult climb

But one rider,
Italy's JuJu Peppi,

Hi, Slim. Welcome.

81
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,733
Slim Robinson was
sports royalty.

82
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,483
His uncle was Jackie Robinson,
who, of course,

was the first black man
in professional baseball.

And throughout his life,
Slim excelled at many different sports,

but obviously struggled
to stand out like his uncle,

which was very white.

89
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,433
And it made him happy,
because it was the last sport

90
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:59,666
where he could break
the color line.

is that I love bicycles.

When I was a kid,

00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:19,467

At a young age, Marty established
himself as the country's best cyclist,

it is truly an honor
to be here to represent Africa,

154
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,300
because... I don't know
if you know this, but Africa's

00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:49,316
Marty Hass would
walk into a bar,

159
00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:51,700
then he would go
over to the jukebox

160
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,183
and put on Bob Marley, "Legend,"

161
00:06:54,383 --> 00:06:56,667
and be shouting,
"African music!"

162
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:58,933
Jamaica is not in Africa.

163
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:01,834
Well, you seem very,
very proud of your homeland.

164
00:07:02,034 --> 00:07:03,133
Indeed I am.
You know, I miss it.

165
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,966
Being here in France,
I miss it back home,

166
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,800
and... I bless the rains
down in Africa.

167
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,533
Right, right,
like the song.

168
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,067
Oh, I'm not familiar
with that.

169
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:14,834
It's the lyrics
to the Toto song, "Africa."

170
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,700
Uh, I'm not familiar
with that.

171
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,400
But at any rate,
it's gonna take a lot...

172
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,700
Both:
To drag me away from you.

173
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,033
From you. That's what I was gonna say!
Shall we do it in harmony?

174
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:24,333
That's so bizarre.
I was gonna say,

175
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:26,667
"Drag me away from you,
from this great interview."

176
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:29,233
Real Africans didn't like
that song, "Africa."

177
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:30,467
That's why he was lying.

178
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,833
You ever seen the dudes
in the band Toto?

179
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:35,333
Those dudes shouldn't
be singing about Africa.

180
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:37,900
Hamm: There's an "honor among thieves"
code in cycling,

181
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,166
and openly discussing the use
of performance-enhancing drugs

182
00:07:41,366 --> 00:07:42,733
is certainly off-limits.

183
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:44,667
But we found
one former cyclist

184
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:46,767
who was bold enough
to speak frankly

185
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,900
under the guise
of anonymity.

186
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:56,066
I'm standing here with the
legendary Gustav Ditters.

187
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:57,783
You look like you're
going to be carrying

188
00:07:57,983 --> 00:07:59,300
a few extra pounds
on the bike this year.

189
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,933
Yes. This is what happens
when you train super hard,

190
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:02,800
on the bicycle.

191
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,434
Honeycut: Well,
it is quite impressive.

192
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:06,500
Looks almost like you
could play a real sport.

193
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:10,033
♪ ♪

194
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:11,933
Ditters:
Everyone was cheating.

195
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:14,033
Everyone...
except for me.

196
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:15,233
Honeycut:
I'm gonna have to work

197
00:08:15,433 --> 00:08:16,800
extra hard to keep up
with you out there.

198
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,833
That's right,
you heard it.

199
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:21,634
This year, I'll be on the bike,
riding alongside the riders,

200
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,050
conducting my interviews
during the race,

201
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,267
that is if I don't
pass out immediately.

202
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:29,333
What do you think about that, Gustav?
Fucking hell, mate.

203
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,700
Hamm: The 1982 Tour de France
was the most eccentric bike race

204
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,300
in the history of cycling,
in large part due to the fact

205
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,900
that virtually every rider
in the race was doping,

206
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,067
nearly all 170 of them.

207
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:58,966
The reason every rider was on drugs in the
'82 race

208
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,383
has to do with the
fact that credit cards

209
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,958
were introduced to
Finland the year before.

210
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:07,245
KultaBank issued the first
Finnish charge card,

211
00:09:07,445 --> 00:09:10,533
and they announced it with
a bizarre commercial.

212
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:45,850
Yeah, it's
a confusing commercial

213
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,933
for a dozen reasons
at least.

214
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:52,133
First of all, why is going down
on his wife payment for this guy?

215
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,634
And what's he paying for?
Spilling the milk?

216
00:09:55,834 --> 00:10:00,066
We saw him spill the milk, so why is she
drinking milk in the very next scene?

217
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,367
You'll notice the woman
doesn't climax,

218
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:05,350
which means the debt
has not been fully repaid,

219
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,333
and likely never will.
Right, guys?

220
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:12,100
Sorry, I just noticed
the crew is mostly women.

221
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:16,233
I'm not good at oral sex.

222
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,600
Hamm: The disciplinary cunnilingus
shown in the commercials

223
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,500
certainly did not do its job explaining
credit cards to the people of Finland.

224
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,500
and this included
the former president

225
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,683
of the UCI,
Ditmer Klerken.

226
00:10:26,883 --> 00:10:28,667
Well, the UCI
was in charge

227
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:30,900
of testing all the
riders for doping,

228
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,267
and the guy in charge of that had
a serious credit card problem.

229
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:38,100
I would see something,
like a cool car

230
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,733
a cool horse,
or something like this,

231
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:43,900
and... and I would hand them
this magic piece of plastic

232
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,734
and they would give me
the cool thing.

233
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:47,200
After three months,
Ditmer owed

234
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,666
nearly $16 million U.S.
to KultaBank.

235
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,999
Because he was
in this huge debt,

236
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:54,333
Ditmer sent every rider
a note saying

237
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:56,667
if they paid him $50,000,

238
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:58,634
they wouldn't
get drug-tested that year.

239
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:01,500
Ditmer: "Hey,
if you don't want to be drug tested,

240
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,300
"make a check out
to Ditmer Klerken

241
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,833
"in the amount
of $50,000 U.S.

242
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:07,066
"and you won't be.
Thanks you guys, Ditmer.

243
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,767
"PS, if you tell
anyone about this,

244
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:11,600
I'll fucking kill you!"

245
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,067
Silly.

246
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:15,500
Wright:
And here we go!

247
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,100
The 1982 Tour de France
has officially begun!

248
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,000
Guys came out flying on bikes!
Man, I wanted to be on a bike so bad.

249
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:47,033
Hamm: Day one,
207 kilometers from Basel to Mohlin,

250
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:50,100
up and over some of the most
breathtaking hillscapes in the world.

251
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,200
a serene landscape that
was completely juxtaposed

252
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,866
to the ugliness
that was about to ensue.

253
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:59,066
Wright: The riders still
holding tight in the peloton.

254
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:02,016
JuJu Peppi not surprisingly
at the front of the pack.

255
00:12:02,216 --> 00:12:04,966
And it looks like we've got
a beautiful fan up ahead!

256
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,367
Hey, hey, bella senora!

257
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:11,333
Wright: And JuJu went in for the
grope and is losing balance!

258
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:13,966
Can he stay up?
Oh no! Oh no!

259
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,600
JuJu's lost his balance!
He's fallen over!

260
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,000
It's a terrible crash!

261
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Yay!

262
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,650
Wright:
People are beginning to stand,

263
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,975
which is a good sign.
Is-a not my fault!

264
00:12:26,175 --> 00:12:28,300
I lose-a sight of the road!
Man: Hey, JuJu!

265
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,834
People:
Whoa!

266
00:12:40,734 --> 00:12:43,067
Hamm:
Jabin Dolchey was known for two things:

267
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:46,400
Fighting and his outfits
that he claimed to be made

268
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,734
from a high-tech breathable
material he called Spanlon.

269
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:52,500
Jabin Dolchey!
Speed the competition!

270
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,800
He was an odd bird,

271
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,734
and he seemed proud
of what everyone could see

272
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:59,033
was a very tiny,
misshaped penis.

273
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,300
Hamm: Jabin's punch kicked off the
most massive scuffle in Tour history.

274
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,100
Honeycut:
Well, this is just awful.

275
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,500
These men are literally trying
to tear one another apart.

276
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,133
Cyclists are
incredible athletes

277
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,300
as far as
endurance goes,

278
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,933
but a great deal of
'em fight like little bitches.

279
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,100
Tyson: They had a dance party,
and people said it was a fight.

280
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,400
As a boxer,
it was offensive to me.

281
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,000
And as is with every
accident near Switzerland,

282
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,567
a Saint Bernard is
the first responder.

283
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,367
It's really peaty.

284
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:42,400
They tried to
hurt each other,

285
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,216
but I am a...
a peaceful person.

286
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,033
I don't do things
like that.

287
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,217
Please!
No! No! I beg you!

288
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:54,434
No! No! Please! I'm naked!

289
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,634
Please put me down!

290
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:58,517
Everything I did that day,

291
00:13:58,717 --> 00:14:00,200
I did in self-defense.

292
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,200
Hamm:
French authorities finally arrived

293
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,000
and put the kibosh
on the fracas.

294
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,534
The first day
was canceled,

295
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:07,933
but with no major injuries,
the race was expected

296
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,300
to resume the following day,

297
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,267
were it not
for a forsaken water bottle.

298
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,467
Ah!

299
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,800
Ooh!

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,133
Woo!

301
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,400
If you take too strong
a dose of amphetamines,

302
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,200
they can act
as a super powerful aphrodisiac.

303
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,667
No, no, no.
Oui.

304
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:52,634
No!

305
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,634
No! No!

306
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
No.

307
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
No.

308
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,567
When I took a large
dose of amphetamines,

309
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:14,467
I ended up
having sex with a...

310
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:20,567
Oh, we have to try every drug
on our banned list,

311
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:21,634
so we know what
we're dealing with.

312
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:23,933
I actually paint what
the experiences are like,

313
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,233
so I can remember
the effects of each drug.

314
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:28,500
Would you like to see them?

315
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,667
So, this is what I painted
while I was on amphetamines.

316
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:36,100
It's kind of what I felt like
when I did the drug.

317
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,067
Yeah.

318
00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:44,300
This is when
I did crack cocaine,

319
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,333
so you can see how similar
the two drugs are.

320
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,467
Oh, this is from
when I did meth.

321
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:58,800
So, you can see that meth is a very
different drug than the other two.

322
00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah.

323
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,634

Ditmer Klerken held
a press conference.

327
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,400
Ditmer, Ditmer.
There are reports that you asked every rider

328
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,233
for $50,000 if they did not want
to be drug tested.

329
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:18,966
Is... is that true?
Yeah, that's true.

330
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:22,533
I mean, no. Fuck! No. I mean...
no, I mean it's not... not true.

331
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,067
Ah fuck! Ah.

332

Now you guys are never
going to believe me

333

because I said
it was true right away.

334
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,400
But no, no, no, that's...
that's not true.

335

But does anybody know
if you admit to something

336
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,000
like taking bribes

337
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,750
and you give all the money back,
for instance,

338
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,500
does that mean that
you could keep your job?

339
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,433
Ah! What a crazy
hypothetical question.

340

Where do I even come up
with this stuff?

341
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:45,533
And nobody ask me
if I'm cheating on my wife,

342
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:47,900
because I am.
Ah! I'm kidding.

No, no. Shit!

00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,766
Hamm: And one by one,
nearly every participant

345
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:55,866
in the race was disqualified
for sending the bribe money.

346
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:59,966
Of the 170 riders entered,
only five did not send checks.

347
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,400
With only
five riders left,

348
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,716
it seemed the Tour
would be canceled.

00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,833
I didn't pay Ditmer.
What I to do?

00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:08,834
But if-a they end the race,
then I am punished for what?

351
00:17:09,034 --> 00:17:10,600
Why punish me?
Look at me.

No, I would never do that.
Are you crazy?

In an unprecedented decision,

Wright:

He is absolutely tearing up the
Pyrenees like a man possessed.

470
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,233
Even taking into account
the past 10 days' rest,

471
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:35,933
this performance
is off the charts!

472
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:38,733
I do not know
what has got into this guy.

473
00:22:38,933 --> 00:22:41,900
Hamm: No one knew what had gotten
into Gustav Ditters that day,

474
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,434
but many suspected
something had, literally.

475
00:22:44,634 --> 00:22:47,200
Setting records is standard
protocol for the Tour de France,

476
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,867
but when you blow records away
and burn up a mountain

Did you just admit to being on drugs?

482
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,600

suspicious of Gustav's newfound energy.

of the proceeding piece

514
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,333
was a woman named
Victoria Young.

515
00:24:35,533 --> 00:24:38,300
I was originally an
animator for Sesame Street,

but then I got
fired from Henson,

because I couldn't

you'd expect.

Cyclists dope to get
their VO2 max levels up,

525
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:03,066
so Gustav figured,
"Why not add red blood cells

"from the creature with
the highest VO2 max level

A cheetah.

Hamm:
Whether it was effective or not,

Gustav did add a foreign
substance to his body.

538

And for doing so,
he was disqualified as a cheetah.

to bring my bike on the road,

00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,534
After that...

776
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:36,050
I rocked a trifecta,
and I passed out.

777
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,367
Man: Oh, cool, yeah.

778
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:42,300
Oh, that's when you, um,
puke and shit and jizz at the same time.

779
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,333
What's a basketball player
look like?

780
00:37:47,533 --> 00:37:48,933
We don't have that
in Napa.

781
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:52,467
That's a basketball player?

782
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:53,667
Jesus!

783
00:37:53,867 --> 00:37:57,033
That makes me even hornier
than the picture of a cyclist.

784
00:38:00,033 --> 00:38:03,133
Oh my shit, he is fine!

785
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:05,800
What the fuck
is in his shorts?

786
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,800
That was just a shocking
moment of television.

787
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,800
It was ferocious
and full of electricity.

788
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,533
It was... felicity.

789
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:26,167
When you put
a crazy person

790
00:38:26,367 --> 00:38:28,133
in charge
of the Tour de France,

791
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:29,733
crazy things will happen.

792
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:33,166
That was Ditmer Perten.
Was that "Perten"?

793
00:38:33,366 --> 00:38:34,400
That was Ditman Kirkman.

794
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,866
That was Ditmar Perper.

795
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:39,600
I mean, how the fuck do you say this
guy's name? What was his name again?

796
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,000
That was Ditman Klerker.
That was Ditman Klerken.

797

That was Ditmar Klerken.
Ditmen Klirken.

798
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,067
Ditman Klerker... Klerken.
Ditmen Klerken.

799
00:38:47,267 --> 00:38:49,634
Ditman Klerker.
Ditmen Klerken. Did I get it?

800
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:51,534
Ditmen Klerken.
Ditmen Klerken.

801
00:38:51,734 --> 00:38:54,500
That's his name, okay.
But he was crazy, though.
