-Hey.

She's not a kid.

She'll take care of herself.

<i>How could you not visit
your sister once, after she moved?</i>

<i>Are you almost there?</i>

22
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:19,259
I can't hear you.

<i>Are you almost there?</i>

24
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,149
Yes, I'm almost there.

<i>Send me pictures.</i>

<i>Check her fridge to see if it's full too.</i>

<i>I wonder if she even does
her laundry regularly.</i>

<i>which was the center of attention
for a while.</i>

31
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:55,169
<i>The pro baseball player Je-hyeok Kim</i>

32
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,629
<i>was arrested for excessive violence
against Choi,</i>

33
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:01,299
<i>who was attempting
to sexually assault his sister.</i>

34
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:04,179
<i>His trial begins this afternoon
at Seoul Western District Court.</i>

35
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:08,219
<i>They'll likely agree it was self-defense
and let him off with probation.</i>

36
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:10,519
<i>The victim is in critical condition,</i>

37
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:14,229
<i>and thus the public is waiting
to see how the court decides.</i>

38

I'm almost at the entrance.

41
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,489
Oh, no. This won't do.

42
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:25,489
There are too many reporters.

43
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:28,199
<i>Let's take my car. I parked it
in the next complex over.</i>

Okay.

45

Are you ready? Hurry up and come down.
Okay?

-<i>Okay.
-Those punks.

<i>You have a delivery, Mr. Kim.</i>

49
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,009
I'll pick it up later.

50
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:31,769
<i>This is abalone,
so you need to eat it soon.</i>

51
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:35,559
I'll be back before dinner.
I'll pick it up soon.

52
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:40,229
MR. RYU
Hurry up, you slow turtle.

53

Day of the verdict
Meeting with the club owner

54
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:47,549
Je-hyeok, give the station a call.

55
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,719
What?

56
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,759
Why?

57
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:54,309
To report a 300-million-won garbage car.

58
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:56,559
What is this? Seriously.

59
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:01,359
Aren't you cold?
How can you eat ice cream in the winter?

60
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,859
I can. It tastes good.

61
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,779
You dense little thing.
Is winter here? "No."

62
00:10:10,859 --> 00:10:12,449
Is it cold? "No."

63
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:14,619
You're so frustrating.

64
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:20,789
Hey. When will you take me here?

65
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:23,419
You said we'll get a table right away
if I go with you.

66
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:26,759
Good. Let's go today after the trial.

67
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,719
I'm meeting with the club owner later.

68
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:33,469
Let's go tomorrow, okay?

69
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,469
Look out the window, will you?

70
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:40,599
How can a person lack all sentimentality?

71
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,149
It's supposed to snow a lot today. Look.

72
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,779
It's nice out, though.

73
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:51,779
You're right.

74
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:56,239
Do you have any sunglasses?
Something cool looking?

75
00:10:57,619 --> 00:10:58,869
What's this?

76
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,829
He's so quick at times like these.

77
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,589
By the way...

78
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,929
Are you sure this isn't you?

79
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:13,799
Gocheok Gunman.

80
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:16,719
Am I nuts? Why would I stalk you?

81
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:19,519
He isn't a stalker. He's a fan.

82
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:20,769
That's a stalker.

83
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:24,099
There's a rumor that
he's a pro baseball scorekeeper.

84
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:26,819
There are so many freaks out there now.
It's dangerous.

85
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:32,449
Charge your phone.
You'll get a lot of calls today.

86
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:35,619
It's okay. 15% is plenty.

87
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:37,739
Do whatever you want.

88
00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:42,459
It's so nice out.

89
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,039
Snow?

90
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,379
No way.

91
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,339
Nothing is impossible.

<i>I'm not sure that's the reason,
but many have requested this song.</i>

97
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,539
<i>It's his entrance song,
selected by the fans.</i>

<i>Here's Sarah Brightman.

This song is everywhere today.

102
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,119
-Are we almost there?
-Yes, almost.

103
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:43,659
Once we pass the tunnel.

104
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:44,999
We're almost there then.

105
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:48,079
Hey, that tunnel is long.
I bet it's the longest in Seoul.

106
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:50,079
It takes over an hour to go through it.

107
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,129
For real?

108
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,629
No, I'm kidding.

109
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,969
How long could a tunnel be?

110
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,969
What are you doing?

111
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:07,599
They say if you can hold your breath
in a tunnel, your wish will come true.

112
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:09,099
What are you, an eight?

113
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,149
Plus, you breathed.

114
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,609
You're right.

115
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:15,069
What are you worried about?

116
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:18,569
The stars are all aligned for you already.

117
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:21,029
Okay, shall we go in?

118
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:23,779
Okay. Let's go.

<i>Case number 2016GO1178.</i>

<i>The defendant Je-hyeok Kim
chased the victim who was running away,</i>

121
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,799
<i>and assaulted him.</i>

122
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,469
<i>The defendant used a trophy,
a dangerous item, to assault him,</i>

123
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,589
<i>and critically injured him.</i>

124
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:45,009
<i>This was excessive and
exceeded justified self-defense.</i>

125

Excuse me. You're Je-hyeok Kim, right?

129
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:38,189
Do you know me?

130
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:41,649
Who in here doesn't know you?

131
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,489
Nexen Heroes' star lefty closer.

132
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,779
Korea's save record holder.
The monster closer.

133
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:48,119
Save king. ERA king.

134
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:51,199
Two-time Korean Series MVP.
Three-time Gold Glove winner.

135
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:54,539
Scouted by the Red Sox
for the highest salary in history...

136
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:57,089
But I see you here.

137
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:02,299
But actually, I'm Hyeon-jong Yang's fan.

138
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:04,799
He's just better looking.

139
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,809
This is odd. Why are you
going to Seobu Detention Center?

140
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:12,389
The hot shot criminals usually go
to Seoul or Nambu Detention Center.

141
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:16,189
If Nambu is like a first-class hotel,
Seobu is like

142
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,269
camping in a tent.

143
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,899
I like being prisonmates with a superstar,
but you must be annoyed.

144
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,819
Are you okay?

145
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:30,659
Are we going to a hotel?

146
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:33,789
Goodness. You're a druggie.

147
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:35,919
You can't keep that up.
Is this your first time?

148
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:39,709
No. I've been to many hotels.

149
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,959
You must be rich.

150
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:44,469
These are Cartier-style.

151
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:49,679
-I have two at home.
-Goodness. This man is in trouble.

152
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,559
He'll get beat up like crazy inside.

153
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,389
They'll smash your head in.

154
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,809
A close friend was also a druggie.
He couldn't get drugs in the slammer,

155
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:58,769
so he whined like a sick dog, and...

156
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:01,819
Mr. Driver. Mister?

157
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:04,069
Heater, please.

158
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:07,239
Please turn on the heater.

159
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,829
We're almost there.
This is Seobu Detention Center.

160
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:18,669
It faces north,
so we don't get much sunlight.

161
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,919
It has hardwood floors
and radiators for heat.

162
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:24,259
The auditorium is over 20 years old.

163
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:26,969
The platform is high,
so when the pastor preaches,

164
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:29,759
it feels like God is speaking,
so that's nice.

165
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,259
WE WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOUR FAMILY.

166
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,189
REFORM THAT PROVIDES DREAMS AND HOPES.
WE ARE BY YOUR SIDE.

167
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:41,399
WE WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOUR FAMILY.

168
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:43,779
SEOBU DETENTION CENTER

169
00:17:48,489 --> 00:17:52,079
SEOBU DETENTION CENTER

170
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:58,039
The shower heads were broken last time.
I wonder if they've fixed them.

171
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:09,929
OPEN REFORM, FUTURE FULL OF HOPE

172
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:30,819
My goodness.

173
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:49,379
Gosh, it's hard to get a cab.

174
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,509
Where would you like to go?

175
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,139
Please take me to Seobu Detention Center.

176
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:55,929
Why are you going there?

177
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:58,349
-To see my son.
-Goodness.

178
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:00,769
How long has he been inside?

179
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:04,809
It doesn't feel like long,
but time really flies.

180
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,279
It must be hard with the cold weather.

181
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:12,859
It's not like it isn't hard
when the weather is nice.

182
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:14,699
It's such a terrible place.

183
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,199
Do they feed them well?
Is it still just rice and beans?

184
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:22,369
He says they give them three meals a day,
but it can't be compared to food outside.

185
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:25,589
I'm bringing him some home-made food.

186
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:32,839
SEOBU DETENTION CENTER

187
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:34,429
We're here.

188
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:37,059
-Here.
-No. Just keep it.

189
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,679
-What?
-It's okay. I don't need it.

190
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:43,729
I have a child too.

191
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,809
Take it, son.

192
00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:48,149
Are you looking down on me now?

193
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:52,239
Ma'am. Put it in your son's
commissary account.

194
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:54,029
Please do it for me.

195
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:56,529
What?

196
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:04,999
How may I help you?

197
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,879
I'd like to see my son.

198
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:08,839
Fill out the visitation form.

199
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:13,509
What form? He never said that.

200
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:17,099
I need to feed my son
before the food gets cold.

201
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:19,349
You can't bring in food,
only commissary money.

202
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:24,059
What? Why is everyone talking
about commissary today?

203
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,859
You're saying I can't see my own son?

204
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,019
You can't do this here.

205
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:29,939
Mom!

206
00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:33,859
I said to come home.

207
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,989
I wanted to see where you work.

208
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:39,369
Plus, I need to go back right away.

209
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:42,159
Why? I said to stay the night.

210
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:44,079
Your dad will starve to death.

211
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:56,009
Hello?

212
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:00,259
They came through the gate already?

213
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,429
<i>Yes. They came early today.</i>

214
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:05,479
Okay. I'll be right there.

215
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:15,279
Mom, I need to go work. Sorry.

216
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,609
Okay, okay. You must be busy. Go.

217
00:21:17,949 --> 00:21:21,369
Eat well, and be careful of people, okay?

218
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:24,949
This place is crawling with crooks.

219
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,499
Don't worry, okay?

220
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,039
This place isn't
as dangerous as you think.

221
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,589
Hello.

222
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:45,429
MORALITY

223
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,849
Where are you going?

224
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,019
Je-hyeok Kim is here.

225
00:21:48,229 --> 00:21:49,559
We need to do cell inspections.

226
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,149
Why?

227
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,649
You didn't get the call?

228
00:21:57,069 --> 00:21:59,239
It's the captain's orders.
We need to hurry.

229
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:02,699
You go alone. That's fine.

230
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:05,369
-Sorry?
-You must not know since you're new,

231
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,119
but you can do it alone.

232
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:08,409
-Really?
-No.

233
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:10,499
Do you really think you can? Do you?

234
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,669
No, sir.

235
00:22:16,589 --> 00:22:18,169
When can I see Je-hyeok Kim?

236
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:30,059
TOOTHPASTE, LAUNDRY SOAP

237
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,369
WELCOME. WE'LL HELP YOU LIKE FAMILY.

238
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,079
It's so cold.

239
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:58,339
Hey. Look at me.

240
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,549
Sit here, Boss.

241
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:02,589
Let's speed it up.

242
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,049
The two of you.

243
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:06,469
-Yes?
-That way.

244
00:23:14,979 --> 00:23:16,939
What is this? It's a size 110.

245
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:17,939
SUPPLIES

246
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,319
I asked for a 105.

247
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,859
What do you take me for?

248
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,239
-You little fuck.
-Eyes down.

249
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,199
I'll gouge out your eyes.

250
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:30,199
You're with the Honey gang, right?
Do you know that your boss

251
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:32,079
sends my boss spam every holiday season?

252
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:33,369
I'll rip you to shreds.

253
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:35,209
Spam? What spam?

254
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,169
No. Stop.

255
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:41,169
Hey, mister. This isn't your bedroom.
Wake up.

256
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:43,219
What are you doing? Stop.

257
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:45,219
-What are you doing?
-Let's go singing.

258
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,969
-Go where?
-Karaoke.

259
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,139
Karaoke?

260
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,059
You were driving in this state?

261
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,479
Stop crying, and fill this out.

262
00:23:56,939 --> 00:23:57,769
I understand.

263
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:03,069
Hey. Let go of my hair.

264
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,409
Don't pull my hair.

265
00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:06,199
-Spam...
-Please leave.

266
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,119
You people...

267
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,079
Why are you fighting?

268
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,369
What's wrong with you?

269
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,249
-I'm a fan.
-Let's go, Nexen.

270
00:24:19,089 --> 00:24:20,379
This is insane.

271
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:24,339
Mister. Do you have this
with elastic along the hem?

272
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:25,679
No, we don't.

273
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:30,179
Then give me one a size bigger.
I'm going to roll it up.

274
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:34,229
Okay.

275
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,409
They say green brings you
peace in your heart,

276
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,829
so many of the items in the prison
are green.

277
00:24:52,499 --> 00:24:53,959
Yes. That's bullshit.

278
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:58,459
The clothes, cell phone, wallet,
watch that you have on you

279
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:01,459
will be kept safely
and returned to you when you're released.

280
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:03,799
How much do you have in your wallet?

281
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:05,679
About 500,000 won.

282
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:09,549
All of that will be converted
into commissary money.

283
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:12,599
You can keep up to 3 million won
in your commissary account.

284
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:17,059
Your family or friends can send you
commissary money online or at the prison.

285
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:21,819
Am I done?

286
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:23,569
No. They need to examine you.

287
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,069
They already did.
They measured my height and weight.

288
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,029
Measuring height and weight is
just a beginning.

289
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:31,239
The special exam is still left.

290
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,329
Anus check.

291
00:25:36,249 --> 00:25:39,249
Some people hide razors, money,
messages in there. Especially...

292
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:44,209
druggies like this hide drugs.
Many people hide illegal objects in there.

293
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:47,179
In the past, the guards checked
your butthole themselves.

294
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,549
It sucks being a prison guard.

295
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:53,389
Now, they use a camera
to protect inmate's human rights.

296
00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:55,139
If you squat on the platform,

297
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:57,269
the camera automatically takes a picture
of your anus.

298
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,599
It's my turn now.

299
00:25:59,689 --> 00:26:03,399
The guard who does the anus check
is here to take me in.

300
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,399
I'll see you again, so I won't say bye.

301
00:26:05,489 --> 00:26:07,649
We're in the same cell. 7A5.

302
00:26:08,489 --> 00:26:09,819
I'm also in 7A5.

303
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:11,319
Wing 7, first floor, cell 5.

304
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:13,449
See you later, Mr. Superstar.

305
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,369
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

306
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,119
Who is he, by the way?

307
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:21,419
He's a know-it-all.

308
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:25,629
Isn't it obvious? He's a know-it-all.

309
00:26:55,809 --> 00:26:59,529
ELECTRONIC VIDEO
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION DEVICE

310
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:07,449
Step on and take off your pants.
Remove your underwear as well.

311
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,849
Okay, good.

312
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:33,309
ANUS EXAMINATION

313
00:27:34,939 --> 00:27:36,599
Yu. Have you seen my walkie-talkie?

314
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:41,149
I think I left it in this office.

315
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:44,399
Where... Now where could I have put it?

316
00:27:44,489 --> 00:27:46,409
I don't know. Where could it be?

317
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,329
Do you think it's in here?
Take a good look.

318
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:52,239
Hey, Lieutenant Yu.

319
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:54,909
You know about the dinner tonight, right?

320
00:27:54,999 --> 00:27:56,329
In case you didn't get the call.

321
00:27:56,419 --> 00:27:58,459
Oh, my gosh. We do?
I didn't hear anything.

322
00:27:59,209 --> 00:28:01,419
Would you jot down
the time and place for me?

323
00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:03,549
Sure. I will. Hello.

324
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,219
-Hello.
-Hello.

325
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:09,849
Okay, Mr. Je-hyeok Kim. Please squat down.

326
00:28:09,969 --> 00:28:11,969
Please say, "Ah," as you squat.

327
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,269
Okay. Ah.

328
00:28:20,189 --> 00:28:21,769
What are you people doing in there?

329
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:24,439
Please help.

330
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:26,109
There's an emergency in wing 5!

331
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:28,319
Red alert! Get over there!

332
00:28:30,569 --> 00:28:34,659
And Lieutenant Yu. Hurry it up.
The newbies are waiting outside. Hurry.

333
00:28:34,749 --> 00:28:36,079
-Yes, Chief.
-Okay.

334
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:39,879
What are you doing? I said to go.

335
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:40,789
You people...

336
00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:43,049
-Hurry.
-Je-hyeok Kim. I'm a fan.

337
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:45,339
Hang in there until your appeal.

338
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:47,299
Please give me an autograph later.

339
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:48,879
Okay, I will.

340
00:28:58,229 --> 00:29:01,269
REFORM THAT PROVIDES DREAMS AND HOPES.
WE ARE BY YOUR SIDE.

341
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:21,789
It's okay. They'll get it out
at the hospital.

342
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:23,879
What did you say he swallowed?

343
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:25,879
A <i>baduk</i> stone,

344
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:28,629
-a <i>janggi</i> piece, a spoon head...
-Yes. Spoon head.

345
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:29,969
And?

346
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:32,429
A nail clipper.

347
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:34,309
What?

348
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:39,479

Lieutenant. Lighten up.

351
00:29:49,699 --> 00:29:53,949
If Je-hyeok Kim appeals,
he'll be here for another few weeks.

352
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,409
Today isn't your only chance.

353
00:29:57,409 --> 00:29:59,789
-You saw him in person, didn't you?
-Sure.

354
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:01,869
How was he?

355
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:04,669
It was my first time
to see a baseball player in person.

356
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:06,709
His physique...

357
00:30:10,469 --> 00:30:14,509
His frame itself is different
from regular people.

358
00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:21,479
Come with me.

do they?

362
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:05,689
Not in these days.

364

Didn't you

368
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:30,379
and I meet two years ago in Daejeon?

369
00:31:31,709 --> 00:31:35,379
I have a vague recollection of seeing you
in Daejeon Detention Center.

370
00:31:35,969 --> 00:31:37,759
That's right. Professor Myung, right?

371
00:31:37,849 --> 00:31:39,849
We met in Jeongseon, right?

372

Long time no see.

373
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:45,939
We were at Kimcheon Juvy together.

374
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:48,689
This punk is a total jailbird.

Baseball is the manliest sport.

Sure.

-Dae-bong Gal.
-Yes, I know.

I mean, please.

405
00:33:34,089 --> 00:33:36,709

I'm powerless.

Hello, Je-hyeok Kim.

409
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:45,969
It's nice to meet you.

410
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:48,849
Even our old man is greeting him.

411
00:33:49,439 --> 00:33:52,979
I didn't know that even you go crazy
for superstars.

412
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,859
Is it my turn now?

413
00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:00,859
I'm Professor Myung.

414
00:34:00,949 --> 00:34:03,159
Of course, I have another name,

415
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:06,989
but I have such great knowledge,
that everyone calls me "Professor Myung."

416
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:11,249
Okay. It's late. Shall we go to sleep now?

417
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:14,249
Says who? There are rules here.

418
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,879
You mean the ritual? Okay, go ahead.

419
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:21,009
Not you. We need to do it
for our superstar.

420
00:34:34,729 --> 00:34:37,189
We may have come to this blessed place

421
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,859
on different days
and for different reasons,

422
00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:44,159
but today, by drinking this glorious
and great blood together,

423
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:46,949
we wish to become brothers.

424

What are you doing? Hey.

425
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:51,709
Hey, guys.

426
00:34:52,249 --> 00:34:53,119
Lift the arm.

427
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:58,379
-Do we need more plastic?
-Hey. This is not right.

428
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:02,049
Je-hyeok Kim is a lefty pitcher.
Put it under his right arm.

429
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:06,259
Seriously!

430
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:07,849
Hold on.

431
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:10,559
Your body temperature may drop
from excessive loss of blood,

432
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:12,769
so if you feel cold or dizzy,

433
00:35:12,939 --> 00:35:15,439
you just have to raise your right foot
high into the sky.

434
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:18,689
Okay, let's begin.

435
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:19,979
Excuse me.

436
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:22,819
Seriously! Just a minute.

437
00:35:22,899 --> 00:35:25,909
Excuse me. Just a minute.

438
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:28,739
Excuse me. Hello? Hello.

439
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:31,119
Just a minute. Just...

440
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:33,869
Just a minute. Please?

441
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:36,249
Just a minute. Professor?

442
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:37,709
Professor.

443
00:35:40,129 --> 00:35:42,049
Professor. Just a minute.

444
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:51,849
Right foot.

445
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:56,769
Just a minute. Now I'm cold!

446
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:58,859
Professor, I'm freezing!

447
00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:02,779
My... My body temperature is dropping.

448
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:05,859
Please don't do this.
Professor, please don't.

449
00:36:08,949 --> 00:36:10,159
Fine.

450
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:12,869
I'll help you this one time.

451
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:16,669
Why? Because we're brothers now.

452
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:19,959
Thank you.

453
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:38,899
Je-hyeok. Your foot is free now.

454
00:36:38,979 --> 00:36:40,729
You may put it down.

455
00:37:34,279 --> 00:37:37,869
Hey, Mr. Superstar.
Turn off the light, will you?

456
00:38:04,269 --> 00:38:07,149
What are you doing? You're such a nitwit.

457
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:09,279
Are you going to do that all night?

458
00:38:18,449 --> 00:38:19,959
Hey. Je-hyeok Kim.

459
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:21,919
Why are you doing?

460
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:24,959
Well... I'm looking for the switch.

461
00:38:27,169 --> 00:38:29,669
Did you ever see someone turn off
the lights in prison?

462
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:33,549
There's no light switch in prison.

463
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:37,809
Don't pick on him so much, will you?
Seriously.

464
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:39,139
Go to sleep.

00:41:16,129 --> 00:41:19,009
I was just dry, that's all!

481
00:41:19,089 --> 00:41:20,799
Help!

482
00:41:21,509 --> 00:41:24,599
Shit. Let go of me, you jerks!

483
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:30,649
Let go! My feet aren't touching the floor!
Oh no!

484
00:41:32,609 --> 00:41:35,069
Help me!

485
00:42:09,389 --> 00:42:11,309
Kim. Here, use this.

486
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:13,559
It's nothing much.

487
00:42:15,439 --> 00:42:18,569
You can't find this in here.
Just let me know,

488
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:20,899
and I'll get you anything you want.

489
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:24,949
Thanks.

490
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:35,539
<i>The law isn't difficult</i>

491
00:42:36,459 --> 00:42:40,129
<i>The law isn't uncomfortable</i>

492
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:45,469
<i>The law helps us</i>

493
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:49,679
<i>The law protects us</i>

494
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:55,859
<i>A convenient world that's alive</i>

495
00:42:58,399 --> 00:42:59,569
It's time to eat, Kim.

496
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,609
I've ordered room service.

497
00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:07,989
<i>Meal time!</i>

498
00:43:09,699 --> 00:43:11,789
Meal time!

499
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:18,999
WING 7
DANGER

500
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:37,479
It's winter, so we get
beef and radish soup often.

501
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:39,189
-Right, gramps?
-Yes.

502
00:43:39,269 --> 00:43:41,739
Korean food in Seobu is pretty good.
I'll probably gain weight.

503
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,319
Here's your soup.

504
00:43:46,529 --> 00:43:47,369
Great.

505
00:43:59,789 --> 00:44:01,629
Hey! Errand Boy!

506
00:44:02,709 --> 00:44:03,039
-Yes?

507
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:04,289
Hey! Errand Boy!

508
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:07,709
-Yes?
-The omelet rolls.

509
00:44:07,869 --> 00:44:09,789
Are you kidding? Give us more.

510
00:44:09,879 --> 00:44:11,209
I'm so sorry.

511
00:44:12,129 --> 00:44:15,129
I may run out, so let me finish the floor
and then give you more.

512
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:18,589
Chief Jo said he'll kill me
if I run out of rations.

513
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:21,099
-Hey, compatriot. You may go now.
-Thanks.

514
00:44:22,009 --> 00:44:25,849
It doesn't look good to fight
first thing in the morning.

515
00:44:26,769 --> 00:44:29,729
Will someone get me my pouch?

516
00:44:36,899 --> 00:44:38,569
SESAME OIL
SOY SAUCE

517
00:44:38,659 --> 00:44:39,859
SPICY ANCHOVY SAUCE

518
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:46,449
There are so many things in this cell.
Everyone must have money.

519
00:44:46,539 --> 00:44:48,669
Professor Myung, get me some too, later.

520
00:44:48,749 --> 00:44:49,869
As long as you pay.

521
00:44:50,379 --> 00:44:52,249
Okay, everyone. Enjoy.

522
00:44:52,339 --> 00:44:53,419
Thank you.

523
00:44:56,799 --> 00:44:58,929
There's no beef in the beef soup here.

524
00:44:59,009 --> 00:45:01,639
It's like a cow dipped its feet briefly.

525
00:45:05,389 --> 00:45:06,849
This punk eats so damn quickly.

526
00:45:08,229 --> 00:45:11,689
It's because he hasn't had
home cooking in a while.

527
00:45:11,979 --> 00:45:13,519
Kim. You should eat too.

528
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:25,239
Hey, Jailbird.
What did you come in for this time?

529
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:28,829
I got a loan from a bank
to pay for my mom's surgery,

530
00:45:28,909 --> 00:45:29,999
but I couldn't pay it back.

531
00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:33,249
You came in
for a very humane reason this time.

532
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:38,089
I don't know if the food here
will be to your liking, Kim.

533
00:45:40,089 --> 00:45:42,799
-It's fine.
-That's a great relief.

534
00:45:43,009 --> 00:45:46,809
The head cook here came in
for murder and mutilation of the body,

535
00:45:46,929 --> 00:45:49,059
but he's a great cook.

536
00:45:54,859 --> 00:45:55,859
<i>Je-hyeok.</i>

537
00:45:56,609 --> 00:45:59,239
Are you okay?
Did you sleep well last night?

538
00:46:01,699 --> 00:46:04,819
How much longer must I stay here?

539
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,159
At most a month.

540
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:07,619
ATTORNEY VISITATION ROOM 3

541
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:10,039
I'll schedule an appeal
as soon as possible.

542
00:46:10,709 --> 00:46:13,579
I think the judge did this
because of all the media attention.

543
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:17,959
But the public sentiment is on your side,
so you'll win the appeal for sure.

544
00:46:20,759 --> 00:46:22,839
Hey. I got a new number.

545
00:46:26,929 --> 00:46:28,519
The reporters won't leave me alone.

546
00:46:50,539 --> 00:46:51,539
I have a favor to ask.

547
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:52,869
A private cell?

548
00:46:54,869 --> 00:46:58,589
Two ministers and the Chief Secretary
will be sent here today.

549
00:46:58,709 --> 00:47:01,009
The private cells are completely booked.
These punks.

550
00:47:03,089 --> 00:47:04,759
Don't worry. Wait a little bit.

551
00:47:05,259 --> 00:47:07,429
I'm making a deal with the warden here.

552
00:47:07,509 --> 00:47:09,759
I got you your own separate time
to exercise.

553
00:47:09,849 --> 00:47:11,429
I'll request a private cell too.

554
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:13,479
This is ridiculous.

555
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:15,899
How could they put you in the same cell
as thieves?

556
00:47:16,399 --> 00:47:17,359
No.

557
00:47:19,189 --> 00:47:21,859
Please take care of my credit card bills
and deliveries.

558
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:23,279
What?

559
00:47:24,899 --> 00:47:26,739
The abalone must've thawed out by now.

560
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:29,449
That too.

561
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:30,539
Okay.

562
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,369
I came in so suddenly.

563
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:34,499
Okay. Don't worry.

564
00:47:35,959 --> 00:47:37,629
I left the boiler on too.

565
00:47:38,209 --> 00:47:39,589
Okay, I'll turn it off.

566
00:47:40,209 --> 00:47:42,759
And I'm supposed
to send gloves and baseballs

567
00:47:43,339 --> 00:47:44,969
to Jung-min's baseball team.

568
00:47:45,379 --> 00:47:46,969
You send them for me.

569
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:50,509
He's your son, so you should know
what brand he likes, right?

570
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:52,349
Don't be late.

571
00:47:52,929 --> 00:47:54,099
Don't worry about my son.

572
00:47:54,929 --> 00:47:56,899
And he has no talent for baseball.

573
00:47:57,479 --> 00:48:01,479
Sports are meant for gifted people.
You need to be born with it, like you.

574
00:48:02,189 --> 00:48:03,109
Hey.

575
00:48:03,939 --> 00:48:05,859
Don't slack off on your workouts.

576
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:08,569
I'm sure you'll take care of it,
but still.

577
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:11,989
How's the gym here? Is it big?

578
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:29,589
Why don't you give us a suggestion too?

579
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:35,809
This guy is from the next wing over.
He just became a dad today.

580
00:48:35,889 --> 00:48:38,349
It's a girl, but they don't have
a name yet, so he wants advice.

581
00:48:41,059 --> 00:48:42,519
How about Mal-shim Kim?

582
00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:46,949
That sounds retarded.

583
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:52,579
It's my mom's name.

584
00:48:58,919 --> 00:49:00,169
Very stupid.

585
00:49:00,959 --> 00:49:01,999
A big moron.

586
00:49:03,589 --> 00:49:06,129
Don't stay together like that. Separate.

587
00:49:24,649 --> 00:49:26,109
You want a baseball?

588
00:49:28,279 --> 00:49:30,409
Yes. Will it be hard?

589
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:34,909
I think it'll be quicker
to get a bat and speed gun.

590
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:38,199
I guess so.

591
00:49:41,869 --> 00:49:43,589
Then, how about an apple...

592
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:45,299
An apple...

593
00:49:47,759 --> 00:49:50,009
That should be doable.

594
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:53,679
If you hold an apple,
it's similar to a baseball.

595
00:49:53,759 --> 00:49:56,809
So it should be of great help
with your training.

596
00:49:56,889 --> 00:49:58,639
Yes. Thank you.

597
00:50:00,729 --> 00:50:02,599
-How much...
-It's 50,000 won.

598
00:50:02,689 --> 00:50:04,809
Just deposit it
into my commissary account.

599
00:50:04,899 --> 00:50:06,899
Of course, you can take your time.

600
00:50:06,979 --> 00:50:10,189
Hey! Jailbird! You. You have a visitor.

601
00:50:11,069 --> 00:50:13,239
Me? I'm not expecting anyone.

602
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:15,619
Yes, you have. And, Je-hyeok Kim!

603
00:50:16,779 --> 00:50:19,659
You have a visitor. Sun-ja Park plus one.

604
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:21,119
Come out.

605
00:50:21,209 --> 00:50:23,369
WAITING ROOM FOR VISITATION

606
00:50:23,459 --> 00:50:25,289
Visitation is for ten minutes.

607
00:50:27,339 --> 00:50:28,339
Okay.

608
00:50:29,339 --> 00:50:30,339
I know.

609
00:50:30,509 --> 00:50:32,799
It'll be very short
if you speak so slowly like that.

610
00:50:34,219 --> 00:50:35,049
Okay.

611
00:50:36,389 --> 00:50:37,969
Who's here to visit you?

612
00:50:40,979 --> 00:50:42,019
My mom.

613
00:50:42,099 --> 00:50:44,479
Why did you think for so long? Who else?

614
00:50:45,019 --> 00:50:45,899
Who else?

615
00:50:46,479 --> 00:50:47,729
It's your mom plus one.

616
00:50:50,819 --> 00:50:52,319
<i>The visitation has begun.</i>

617
00:50:52,399 --> 00:50:53,909
Why did you come?

618
00:50:57,239 --> 00:50:58,159
Did you eat?

619
00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:01,249
I'm eating well. It's nice here.

620
00:51:04,169 --> 00:51:05,329
Are you sleeping well?

621
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,589
Yes. You don't need to worry.

622
00:51:10,049 --> 00:51:11,259
Isn't it cold?

623
00:51:12,589 --> 00:51:14,299
How's the heater? Is it warm enough?

624
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:16,639
Yes.

625
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:18,759
It's fine.

626
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:23,349
-Je-hee...
-Je-hee...

627
00:51:23,809 --> 00:51:24,769
Don't bring her.

628
00:51:26,689 --> 00:51:29,769
I'm sure she's just crying anyway.
Don't bother bringing her.

629
00:51:31,899 --> 00:51:33,319
Mom, I'm really okay.

630
00:51:39,279 --> 00:51:40,409
Oh, my.

631
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:42,449
I almost used up all the time.

632
00:51:43,499 --> 00:51:46,459
Ji-ho. You must have much more to say.

633
00:51:46,669 --> 00:51:48,329
I'll let you talk.

634
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:16,699
What? You still didn't tell her
that we broke up?

635
00:52:19,279 --> 00:52:20,579
I was going to.

636
00:52:31,089 --> 00:52:33,339
Stop. Nails.

637
00:52:39,219 --> 00:52:40,049
Are you okay?

638
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:41,929
No.

639
00:52:43,179 --> 00:52:45,349
- How's the food?
- It tastes like crap.

640
00:52:46,059 --> 00:52:46,889
Did you sleep well?

641
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:49,019
No. I didn't sleep a wink.

642
00:52:49,729 --> 00:52:51,809
- Isn't it cold?
- It is.

643
00:52:52,149 --> 00:52:53,149
I think I caught a cold.

644
00:52:58,359 --> 00:53:00,699
Your shirt looks very low-cut.

645
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:04,079
What's it to you? We broke up.

646
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:10,459
How can you laugh right now?

647
00:53:12,169 --> 00:53:13,129
You're right.

648
00:53:14,379 --> 00:53:15,419
Be careful of people.

649
00:53:17,549 --> 00:53:18,379
You be careful.

650
00:53:18,969 --> 00:53:20,339
I'm always careful.

651
00:53:20,429 --> 00:53:22,469
- Should we fight again?
- Should we?

652
00:53:22,549 --> 00:53:24,139
<i>You have one minute remaining.</i>

653
00:53:25,429 --> 00:53:26,269
What was that?

654
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:29,809
We have one minute left.

655
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:41,199
Ji-ho.

656
00:53:42,409 --> 00:53:43,489
I'm fine.

657
00:53:44,029 --> 00:53:46,739
So you don't need
to come here anymore. Okay?

658
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:49,249
Who said I would?

659
00:53:50,289 --> 00:53:51,289
You're right.

660
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:57,339
You did nothing wrong.

661
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:02,509
So don't be discouraged.

662
00:54:05,429 --> 00:54:07,099
We're all on your side.

663
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:14,109
<i>Your visitation has ended.</i>

664
00:54:14,189 --> 00:54:17,069
<i>Please exit
for the next visitation to begin.</i>

665
00:54:25,069 --> 00:54:26,529
And if you need anything...

666
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:34,249
That son of a...

667
00:54:42,929 --> 00:54:44,299
Hey, gramps.

668
00:54:45,339 --> 00:54:47,469
It still stinks.

669
00:54:47,759 --> 00:54:50,019
-Clean the toilet again.
-Okay.

670
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:52,229
Okay. I will.

671
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:55,559
Do it right the first time.

672
00:54:56,149 --> 00:54:58,109
Don't make me tell you to redo it.

673
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:07,239
How was your visit?

674
00:55:07,449 --> 00:55:09,199
Was it your girlfriend?

675
00:55:09,369 --> 00:55:12,709
What's this?
Mr. Superstar has a girlfriend?

676
00:55:13,659 --> 00:55:15,079
This is breaking news.

677
00:55:16,829 --> 00:55:17,669
No.

678
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:20,299
What?

679
00:55:20,379 --> 00:55:22,049
He says he doesn't have one.

680
00:55:25,929 --> 00:55:27,349
Shit. I need to pee.

681
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:31,219
Hey. Move.

682
00:55:33,179 --> 00:55:34,229
Excuse me.

683
00:55:35,439 --> 00:55:37,269
-What?
-Don't do that.

684
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:41,939
What's it to you?

685
00:55:57,329 --> 00:55:58,289
Look.

686
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:00,709
Mr. Superstar.

687
00:56:02,839 --> 00:56:05,219
Just mind your own business
until you get out.

688
00:56:05,509 --> 00:56:07,179
Don't mind yourself here.

689
00:56:08,549 --> 00:56:10,809
But he's an elderly man.
You're being too mean.

690
00:56:10,889 --> 00:56:11,759
Shit!

691
00:56:13,889 --> 00:56:16,229
There are no kids or adults
in the slammer.

692
00:56:17,309 --> 00:56:20,109
Everyone is a thief in here. Got it?

693
00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:22,439
I'm back.

694
00:56:23,609 --> 00:56:25,989
Look, Mr. Superstar.

695
00:56:27,609 --> 00:56:29,869
Just stay out of it, you fucking asshole.

696
00:56:33,489 --> 00:56:35,039
Apologize.

697
00:56:35,249 --> 00:56:36,079
What?

698
00:56:36,749 --> 00:56:37,919
I said to apologize.

699
00:56:42,169 --> 00:56:43,299
I don't want to.

700
00:56:44,339 --> 00:56:46,549
I said I don't want to, you fuck.

701
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:58,059
Shit. That little...
Who does he think he is?

702
00:56:59,479 --> 00:57:02,059
-You little...
-Stop it, you rat!

703
00:57:03,269 --> 00:57:04,609
Shut up, you rat.

704
00:57:05,859 --> 00:57:09,239
Stay out of my life, okay?

705
00:57:09,909 --> 00:57:12,069
Got it, you asshole?

706
00:57:27,669 --> 00:57:29,299
<i>Delivery!</i>

707
00:57:29,799 --> 00:57:31,839
Everyone, let's sit down.

708
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:34,719
Let's check the goods.

709
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:37,599
What are you doing, Kim? Sit down.

710
00:57:39,769 --> 00:57:41,689
Let me confirm your order.

711
00:57:42,609 --> 00:57:45,729
Six milks, three cartons of orange juice.

712
00:57:46,149 --> 00:57:49,029
Black tea, ginger tea, barley tea.

713
00:57:49,649 --> 00:57:53,159
Six chicken legs, sesame oil,
foam cleanser.

714
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:57,199
Electric razor.

715
00:57:58,499 --> 00:58:00,119
It's full again today.

716
00:58:00,539 --> 00:58:02,289
Professor Myung, it's your turn, right?

717
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,039
Please sign here.

718
00:58:07,549 --> 00:58:08,919
COMMISSARY ACCOUNT ACTIVITIES

719
00:58:09,009 --> 00:58:12,049
That's right. Professor,
why did you order an apple?

720
00:58:13,299 --> 00:58:16,219
The uncles here don't eat apples
because they don't taste good.

721
00:58:16,469 --> 00:58:18,429
You should order something
that's in season.

722
00:58:21,439 --> 00:58:24,189
Oh. Mr. Je-hyeok Kim. Hello.

723
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:28,649
If you need anything, place an order.
It's much nicer than a department store.

724
00:58:28,729 --> 00:58:29,689
Get lost.

725
00:58:29,859 --> 00:58:30,859
Okay.

726
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:39,159
Gramps.

727
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:42,669
One milk and one juice, right?

728
00:58:43,169 --> 00:58:45,629
Yes. Thanks. Thank you.

729
00:58:47,999 --> 00:58:48,919
Hey, Kim.

730
00:58:50,509 --> 00:58:51,799
Nice catch.

731
00:58:54,299 --> 00:58:56,049
It was just a practical joke we play.

732
00:59:02,389 --> 00:59:05,689
CAUTION: SLIPPERY
SILENCE

733
00:59:07,899 --> 00:59:09,779
You're really fit.
You're an athlete after all.

734
00:59:10,109 --> 00:59:11,689
But you have to wash very quickly.

735
00:59:13,739 --> 00:59:14,659
Okay.

736
00:59:14,739 --> 00:59:16,159
You're really in trouble.

737
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,329
-Me?
-Yes.

738
00:59:19,949 --> 00:59:22,079
-Why?
-Gramps has no money.

739
00:59:22,749 --> 00:59:25,919
We place orders all together
under one person's name,

740
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,459
and take turns paying.

741
00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:30,629
Gramps has no money,
so he works it off instead.

742
00:59:31,209 --> 00:59:34,839
That's how he survives in here. Why did
you get involved? You messed up, right?

743
00:59:37,469 --> 00:59:40,309
How was your visitation?
Your mom cried a lot, didn't she?

744
00:59:45,389 --> 00:59:47,439
Me? My sister.

745
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:51,029
I wondered what made her come.
My mom's surgery didn't go well.

746
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:53,399
She's in the ICU at Shinchon Hospital.

747
00:59:54,069 --> 00:59:55,359
She's in critical condition.

748
00:59:57,279 --> 00:59:59,449
She needs another surgery today,

749
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:01,699
but she can't get it
because we don't have the money.

750
01:00:03,449 --> 01:00:04,289
What?

751
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:06,499
Oh, I'm fine.

752
01:00:08,919 --> 01:00:10,499
There's nothing we can do.

753
01:00:11,419 --> 01:00:14,589
When my dad died in a car accident
when I was seven,

754
01:00:14,669 --> 01:00:15,969
I bawled my head off.

755
01:00:16,469 --> 01:00:18,969
But my uncle took
the insurance money and fled.

756
01:00:19,759 --> 01:00:22,469
I lived in a shack with
my maternal grandma, mom, and sister.

757
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:25,519
It caught on fire, and my grandma died.

758
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:28,309
My sister got a bad burn scar
on her face and became ugly.

759
01:00:28,899 --> 01:00:30,979
My poor sister.

760
01:00:33,939 --> 01:00:37,399
My mom did all sorts of work
at restaurants.

761
01:00:37,989 --> 01:00:40,319
She was hit by a hit-and-run driver
on her way from work.

762
01:00:40,659 --> 01:00:43,449
He was drunk and speeding,
but they still haven't caught him.

763
01:00:43,699 --> 01:00:45,659
My mom damaged her brain
pretty badly back then

764
01:00:45,749 --> 01:00:47,289
and got several rounds of surgery.

765
01:00:47,789 --> 01:00:49,629
I thought the last surgery

766
01:00:49,709 --> 01:00:52,459
would be the last one,
so I lied and got a loan from the bank.

767
01:00:54,049 --> 01:00:55,589
She probably won't make it this time.

768
01:00:58,589 --> 01:00:59,839
I think she'll pass away.

769
01:01:02,849 --> 01:01:07,099
Hey. It's our turn. Let's go.
We don't get hot showers that often.

770
01:01:15,899 --> 01:01:18,489
CAUTION: SLIPPERY

771
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:21,779
USE WATER SPARINGLY

772
01:01:28,409 --> 01:01:31,499
You don't have shampoo. Here, use this.

773
01:01:31,579 --> 01:01:33,589
Buy me some shampoo too, next time.

774
01:01:53,979 --> 01:01:55,569
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

775
01:01:58,149 --> 01:02:00,779
There isn't much left, but here.

776
01:02:02,699 --> 01:02:04,159
-Thank you.
-Not at all.

777
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:06,949
The hot water will cut off soon.

778
01:02:07,449 --> 01:02:10,459
It doesn't come out for
the entire ten minutes. You should hurry.

779
01:02:11,789 --> 01:02:13,669
Okay. Thank you.

780
01:02:31,059 --> 01:02:31,979
It's cold.

781
01:02:38,029 --> 01:02:39,859
Yes. Quitting time.

782
01:02:40,649 --> 01:02:41,649
Aren't you leaving?

783
01:02:45,529 --> 01:02:46,529
I should.

784
01:02:46,619 --> 01:02:48,119
JOON-HO LEE

785
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:51,329
Je-hyeok Kim Had a First Visitor
in the Detention Center

786
01:02:52,959 --> 01:02:54,119
First visitor?

787
01:02:54,919 --> 01:02:56,419
Even this is news?

788
01:02:56,879 --> 01:02:58,419
It must be such a pain for him.

789
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:00,709
I know.

790
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:05,679
My poor Je-hyeok. It must be such a pain.

791
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,139
So cold.

792
01:03:09,809 --> 01:03:11,389
You're back. Good job.

793
01:03:12,809 --> 01:03:14,019
You too.

794
01:03:22,279 --> 01:03:24,029
He's fine. Don't worry.

795
01:03:25,159 --> 01:03:27,569
He probably isn't asleep yet.
You can go look.

796
01:03:29,829 --> 01:03:34,289
<i>How long</i>

797
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:40,629
<i>Can a person live</i>

798
01:03:41,419 --> 01:03:46,589
<i>This dog poop like world</i>

799
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:47,969
<i>Round</i>

800
01:03:48,049 --> 01:03:51,009
Couldn't they play <i>Sex and Zen</i> instead?
They have no taste.

801
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:02,069
<i>But you know, Je-hyeok Kim is so clueless.</i>

802
01:04:02,689 --> 01:04:04,859
I feel like he'll cry
and ask for a private cell.

803
01:04:05,949 --> 01:04:08,199
He's a bit dumb.

804
01:04:10,369 --> 01:04:12,909
I don't know if he can survive in here.

805
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:16,959
He looks like the perfect idiot
that people pick on.

806
01:04:18,539 --> 01:04:19,789
Je-hyeok Kim

807
01:04:20,879 --> 01:04:21,879
has a bad temper.

808
01:04:23,959 --> 01:04:26,629
-What?
-Je-hyeok Kim has a bad temper.

809
01:04:29,549 --> 01:04:30,889
His fans all know.

810
01:04:37,189 --> 01:04:38,019
Hey, gramps.

811
01:04:40,769 --> 01:04:42,149
You love that, right?

812
01:04:44,069 --> 01:04:46,779
-Thank you.
-Sure.

813
01:04:48,659 --> 01:04:49,619
Eat it all right now.

814
01:04:52,029 --> 01:04:53,079
Eat it all right now.

815
01:04:54,829 --> 01:04:56,579
What are you waiting for? Eat.

816
01:05:04,379 --> 01:05:07,089
Hey, Kim. Stop glaring at me.

817
01:05:07,759 --> 01:05:08,929
You look like a fish.

818
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:11,889
I was just kidding.

819
01:05:12,469 --> 01:05:13,929
I'm so scared.

820
01:05:14,889 --> 01:05:17,639
I'm too scared of the superstar
to live here.

821
01:05:19,139 --> 01:05:22,559
Je-hyeok Kim is usually slow
and seems easy,

822
01:05:23,649 --> 01:05:26,279
but once he loses it, it's crazy.

823
01:05:27,149 --> 01:05:28,279
He's frightening.

824
01:05:46,919 --> 01:05:48,919
<i>That's why his nickname is
Mok-dong Psycho.</i>

825
01:05:49,469 --> 01:05:50,879
<i>Isn't he the Mok-dong Idol?</i>

826
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:53,009
<i>Idol? As if.</i>

827
01:06:18,329 --> 01:06:19,329
Get up.

828
01:06:25,209 --> 01:06:26,709
Hey. I said to get up.

829
01:06:29,209 --> 01:06:30,299
What is it?

830
01:06:36,009 --> 01:06:37,179
Are you nuts?

831
01:06:38,969 --> 01:06:41,559
-Speak nicely.
-What?

832
01:06:42,939 --> 01:06:45,859
I said to speak nicely, you asshole!

833
01:06:47,729 --> 01:06:48,939
Aren't you guys leaving?

834
01:06:50,649 --> 01:06:53,029
I should go. Go ahead.
I'll change and go too.

835
01:06:53,239 --> 01:06:54,989
Okay. I'll go then.

836
01:06:55,449 --> 01:06:56,279
See you tomorrow.

837
01:07:01,329 --> 01:07:08,129
HOUSEMATE

838
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:14,089
Hey. You left work already?

839
01:07:14,759 --> 01:07:17,759
Let go! Get over here, you jerk!

840
01:07:17,889 --> 01:07:20,139
Get over here! Come here.

841
01:07:20,219 --> 01:07:22,019
You come to me, jerk. You stupid ass.

842
01:07:22,099 --> 01:07:25,769
Hey! Let go. You're lost your marbles!

843
01:07:25,849 --> 01:07:28,859
You stupid asshole. You don't have
the guts to beat up a superstar, do you?

844
01:07:29,859 --> 01:07:30,899
Damn it!

845
01:07:30,979 --> 01:07:32,239
What are you doing?

846
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:34,859
Chief Jo!

847
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:37,159
This jerk is a complete psycho!

848
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:41,619
He's a mad dog! Look at me!
This jerk beat me up!

849
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:45,869
Je-hyeok. Did you do that to Seagull?

850
01:07:46,209 --> 01:07:47,709
Yes. I beat him up.

851
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:51,249
This crazy psycho shit!

852
01:07:53,009 --> 01:07:55,589
Blood!

853
01:07:56,049 --> 01:07:58,799
-Bring Seagull to the infirmary.
-Yes, sir.

854
01:08:00,429 --> 01:08:01,679
Let's go.

855
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:03,729
Come out.

856
01:08:03,809 --> 01:08:06,689
You're headed straight to
the segregation unit. You'll die.

857
01:08:14,149 --> 01:08:16,069
-Je-hyeok, come out.
-It was an accident.

858
01:08:16,149 --> 01:08:18,989
Rather than the segregation unit,
maybe he can wait in another...

859
01:08:19,069 --> 01:08:20,369
Drop the bull.

860
01:08:20,949 --> 01:08:23,079
Kim. I think you'll have to go.

861
01:08:35,919 --> 01:08:38,179
Hey. I'll take him.

862
01:08:38,509 --> 01:08:39,759
You will?

863
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:41,389
Go have some coffee.

864
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:51,229
That jerk messed with you again.

865
01:09:07,869 --> 01:09:09,039
Hey, Kim.

866
01:09:09,959 --> 01:09:11,169
Cigarette?

867
01:09:12,459 --> 01:09:14,879
No thank you. I quit.

868
01:09:16,759 --> 01:09:18,799
This is very valuable in here.

869
01:09:20,139 --> 01:09:24,929
Okay. I guess athletes
need to take care of their bodies.

870
01:09:27,809 --> 01:09:29,979
Then do you want one of these?

871
01:09:31,309 --> 01:09:35,319
Glass products like these
are nearly impossible to get in here.

872
01:09:36,609 --> 01:09:37,439
Thank you.

873
01:09:38,449 --> 01:09:40,859
Sure. You know,

874
01:09:41,239 --> 01:09:44,829
you check age and pride at the door

875
01:09:45,159 --> 01:09:46,789
when you come in here.

876
01:09:48,539 --> 01:09:52,539
Those who were nobodies outside
fight to become the boss

877
01:09:52,629 --> 01:09:55,549
when they come in here.
How ridiculous, right?

878
01:10:00,009 --> 01:10:03,049
But still, there are rules
even in a place like this.

879
01:10:04,349 --> 01:10:07,219
If you cause trouble as you did,
you're supposed to be segregated,

880
01:10:08,059 --> 01:10:11,729
but that could be held against you
when you appeal.

881
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:17,149
That's why I'm making an exception
and looking the other way

882
01:10:17,319 --> 01:10:18,149
because I like you.

883
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:23,029
Thank you. I owe you one.
I'll repay you for this.

884
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:25,619
Yes, of course you must.

885
01:10:37,919 --> 01:10:40,469
Well, you can just repay me now

886
01:10:40,969 --> 01:10:42,429
for what you owe.

887
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:45,099
With money.

888
01:10:47,179 --> 01:10:49,719
You have an appointment
with your lawyer tomorrow.

889
01:10:49,929 --> 01:10:53,809
Ask your lawyer to send money
to this account.

890
01:10:56,649 --> 01:10:58,229
Here you go.

891
01:10:59,729 --> 01:11:01,779
Oh, right. This would be better.

892
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:04,819
You can just call.

893
01:11:05,659 --> 01:11:08,369
Call your family or close friend

894
01:11:09,949 --> 01:11:11,659
and ask for 30 million won.

895
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:14,249
Have them deposit it
into that account now.

896
01:11:19,419 --> 01:11:20,259
Go on.

897
01:11:23,929 --> 01:11:27,969
What are you doing? Hurry.
Someone will come in.

898
01:11:35,229 --> 01:11:36,229
Chief Jo.

899
01:11:37,609 --> 01:11:41,649
Hi, Lee. What is it?
Why didn't you go home?

900
01:11:41,989 --> 01:11:43,819
You need to go to 2023. It's flipping out.

901
01:11:46,949 --> 01:11:50,329
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.
Get it done by tomorrow, please.

902
01:11:52,749 --> 01:11:55,039
God, what a nuisance.

903
01:11:55,169 --> 01:11:57,079
Seagull, that jerk.

904
01:11:57,249 --> 01:12:01,499
That's right. Please escort Kim
to his cell for me.

905
01:12:02,839 --> 01:12:05,379
While you're at it,
take advantage of the situation,

906
01:12:05,469 --> 01:12:08,009
and have a fan meeting with him.

907
01:12:08,139 --> 01:12:10,599
Your wish has come true.

908
01:13:13,839 --> 01:13:14,799
Joon-ho.

909
01:13:16,929 --> 01:13:18,049
What are you doing here?

910
01:13:18,139 --> 01:13:20,349
Hey, Superstar.

911
01:13:21,259 --> 01:13:23,219
-It's been a while.
-Shut it.

912
01:13:25,849 --> 01:13:28,649
-What are you doing here?
-What else? I'm a corrections officer.

913
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:32,609
You punk. And you come to see me now?

914
01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:34,739
That's not it.

915
01:13:35,029 --> 01:13:38,109
Some jerk swallowed a nail clipper,
so I was at the hospital

916
01:13:38,199 --> 01:13:39,699
for the past two days.

917
01:13:39,949 --> 01:13:41,779
I wanted to come right away.

918
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:46,119
What about you? You caused trouble
already, in that short time?

919
01:13:56,589 --> 01:13:58,679
How's your arm? Is it okay?

920
01:14:01,179 --> 01:14:03,809
Of course. That was so long ago.

921
01:14:05,219 --> 01:14:06,099
What about you?

922
01:14:07,519 --> 01:14:08,769
Me too.

923
01:14:10,519 --> 01:14:11,729
I'm good.

924
01:14:24,539 --> 01:14:28,869
FALL 2015

925
01:14:28,959 --> 01:14:30,539
<i>Only one out remains.</i>

926
01:14:30,619 --> 01:14:33,879
<i>Pitching is the Gwangju Jeil HS' ace,
the gifted teen pitcher.</i>

927
01:14:34,089 --> 01:14:37,089
<i>Will Gwangju Jeil win
or will it be a big upset?</i>

928
01:14:51,939 --> 01:14:53,359
Out!

929
01:15:07,999 --> 01:15:11,959
GWANGJU

930
01:15:16,589 --> 01:15:18,169
Uncle, me too.

931
01:15:28,429 --> 01:15:30,019
Don't do that to a kid.

932
01:15:31,019 --> 01:15:32,019
Is it good?

933
01:15:33,189 --> 01:15:34,189
Come here.

934
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:37,569
Here.

935
01:15:39,489 --> 01:15:40,649
Where's Coach?

936
01:15:40,949 --> 01:15:41,989
I don't know.

937
01:15:43,609 --> 01:15:45,409
Sit straight. Straighten your back.

938
01:15:48,909 --> 01:15:49,909
Instant noodles again?

939
01:15:49,999 --> 01:15:52,249
How can you eat noodles
after having barbecues?

940
01:15:52,459 --> 01:15:53,619
They're still growing.

941
01:15:54,209 --> 01:15:56,589
And kids prefer instant noodles
over barbecues.

942
01:15:57,039 --> 01:15:58,169
I brought beer.

943
01:15:59,169 --> 01:16:00,299
May we have some, Coach?

944
01:16:00,379 --> 01:16:03,299
It's a gift for winning.
And there's no practice tomorrow.

945
01:16:06,049 --> 01:16:08,889
Of course not. What's the point?
They'll be graduating soon.

946
01:16:09,929 --> 01:16:11,059
Did you decide where to go?

947
01:16:11,429 --> 01:16:13,139
Doosan? LG?

948
01:16:13,229 --> 01:16:14,979
Bears or Twins?

949
01:16:15,059 --> 01:16:16,189
Whoever pays more.

950
01:16:17,609 --> 01:16:20,529
Nice. I like your attitude.

951
01:16:21,109 --> 01:16:22,949
Okay, then. Excuse us.

952
01:16:23,609 --> 01:16:24,659
Let's go.

953
01:16:31,329 --> 01:16:33,579
How will you live without them?

954
01:16:33,999 --> 01:16:35,289
Just keep them here.

955
01:16:35,619 --> 01:16:38,249
They can keep living here with us
even after they go to the pros.

956
01:16:38,879 --> 01:16:40,499
They can't commute from Gwangju to Seoul.

957
01:16:43,169 --> 01:16:46,679
Gosh. One has clubs knocking down doors,

958
01:16:47,549 --> 01:16:49,969
but the other doesn't have a single offer.

959
01:16:51,719 --> 01:16:54,099
But in the long run,

960
01:16:55,479 --> 01:16:56,769
he'll do better.

961
01:16:57,519 --> 01:16:58,809
In whose lifetime?

962
01:17:26,179 --> 01:17:27,889
I guess even you can't beat alcohol.

963
01:17:38,059 --> 01:17:39,229
Are you up already?

964
01:17:39,399 --> 01:17:43,069
I guess habits are a scary thing
after all.

965
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:44,819
I'm going back to sleep.

966
01:17:46,279 --> 01:17:47,199
Go ahead.

967
01:17:47,319 --> 01:17:50,529
I guess he's still human, though.
Who would've thought we'd see the day?

968
01:17:51,369 --> 01:17:52,909
He already did.

969
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:57,039
He worked out already,
washed up and went to sleep again.

970
01:18:04,959 --> 01:18:07,339
What a devoted coach.

971
01:18:07,509 --> 01:18:09,929
You should just move in with them
in Seoul.

972
01:18:10,259 --> 01:18:11,179
I'll be back soon.

973
01:18:11,259 --> 01:18:13,559
Don't come back soon. Drive safely.

974
01:18:19,139 --> 01:18:20,309
Thank you for everything.

975
01:18:21,269 --> 01:18:23,769
I will never forget
all you've done for us.

976
01:18:31,529 --> 01:18:34,489
I'll buy you the most expensive thing
in Seoul.

977
01:18:36,579 --> 01:18:37,579
Thank you.

978
01:18:56,809 --> 01:18:58,599
What are you doing? Say bye to Daddy.

979
01:18:59,309 --> 01:19:01,309
-Is he going far away?
-Yes.

980
01:19:01,559 --> 01:19:03,359
He's going very far away.

981
01:19:10,529 --> 01:19:12,359
<i>Next, a car accident.</i>

982
01:19:12,609 --> 01:19:15,699
<i>There was a three-car collision
near the rest area in Jeongeup</i>

983
01:19:15,779 --> 01:19:18,079
<i>on the north-bound side
of the Honam Expressway.</i>

984
01:19:18,329 --> 01:19:21,419
<i>The driver of the sedan,
Hyuk-kwon Kim, the coach</i>

985
01:19:21,499 --> 01:19:24,669
<i>of the Gwangju Jeil High School's
baseball team died on the spot.</i>

986
01:19:25,129 --> 01:19:27,759
<i>Passengers, baseball players Kim and Lee,
were critically injured.</i>

987
01:19:27,839 --> 01:19:30,299
<i>They were transported to a hospital
and are being treated,</i>

988
01:19:30,379 --> 01:19:32,429
<i>but they are still in critical condition.</i>

989
01:19:32,799 --> 01:19:35,429
<i>Due to the accident,
there is massive congestion</i>

990
01:19:35,509 --> 01:19:37,059
<i>near the rest area in Jeongeup.</i>

991
01:19:37,309 --> 01:19:39,679
<i>The police state that...</i>

992
01:19:42,189 --> 01:19:44,859
JOON-HO LEE
JE-HYEOK KIM

993
01:19:56,279 --> 01:19:58,289
Thank goodness it wasn't worse.

994
01:19:58,869 --> 01:20:02,619
There's a 50% chance of success
for elbow surgeries.

995
01:20:03,749 --> 01:20:07,879
You are very muscular,
so I think you'll be able to return

996
01:20:08,419 --> 01:20:10,669
after a year of rehab.

997
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:15,889
It's quite serious.

998
01:20:17,049 --> 01:20:19,309
Your shoulder popped out from the impact
and broke.

999
01:20:19,889 --> 01:20:21,769
The left shoulder was
dislocated and fractured.

1000
01:20:22,179 --> 01:20:24,019
We need to look more closely,

1001
01:20:24,229 --> 01:20:28,439
but surgery seems to be the only option
at this time. However,

1002
01:20:29,269 --> 01:20:32,399
there's only a 10% chance of success.

1003
01:20:34,699 --> 01:20:37,869
It won't hinder your daily life,

1004
01:20:38,329 --> 01:20:40,199
but if you're a pitcher,

1005
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:43,369
it looks pretty bad.

1006
01:20:45,209 --> 01:20:47,539
If you don't get surgery,
it'll probably take

1007
01:20:49,379 --> 01:20:51,509
two to three years more
to rehabilitate it.

1008
01:20:52,919 --> 01:20:54,879
And... Well...

1009
01:21:04,689 --> 01:21:08,769
JOON-HO LEE
JE-HYEOK KIM

1010
01:21:08,859 --> 01:21:10,399
<i>We tried to stop him,</i>

1011
01:21:10,769 --> 01:21:12,779
<i>but he was certain he wanted to leave.</i>

1012
01:21:13,989 --> 01:21:15,779
<i>He said he won't continue
playing baseball,</i>

1013
01:21:16,279 --> 01:21:18,319
<i>and that he'll return home to his family.</i>

1014
01:21:19,239 --> 01:21:21,539
<i>His mother came today and took him home.</i>

1015
01:21:22,789 --> 01:21:26,119
<i>It's a shame. He had a good chance
with surgery.</i>

1016
01:21:39,639 --> 01:21:40,599
Je-hyeok.

1017
01:21:50,269 --> 01:21:51,269
Thank you.

1018
01:21:52,439 --> 01:21:55,399
No. I have nothing else to do anyway.

1019
01:21:56,989 --> 01:21:58,819
If you said you'd quit as well,

1020
01:22:00,369 --> 01:22:04,489
He may have broken down in heaven.

1021
01:22:05,659 --> 01:22:06,499
Thank you.

1022
01:22:07,329 --> 01:22:08,369
It's nothing.

1023
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:12,459
Je-hyeok.

1024
01:22:14,419 --> 01:22:15,459
It'll be very hard.

1025
01:22:16,509 --> 01:22:18,179
It may take a very long time, too.

1026
01:22:19,179 --> 01:22:20,339
It's okay.

1027
01:22:21,889 --> 01:22:23,469
I know it may take long,

1028
01:22:24,929 --> 01:22:26,599
but you know I'm slow.

1029
01:22:29,559 --> 01:22:32,769
No club scouted me anyway.

1030
01:22:33,819 --> 01:22:37,069
I'm late anyway, so I'll fix everything

1031
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:42,279
here and there, and start over.

1032
01:22:53,669 --> 01:22:55,669
What did you and Chief Jo talk about?

1033
01:22:56,379 --> 01:22:57,459
Nothing much.

1034
01:23:04,889 --> 01:23:05,719
Joon-ho.

1035
01:23:07,889 --> 01:23:09,309
May I make a phone call?

1036
01:23:19,439 --> 01:23:20,399
Make it quick.

1037
01:23:20,899 --> 01:23:22,989
If we get caught,
I'll be wearing that too.

1038
01:23:55,979 --> 01:23:58,069
Hello? Hey.

1039
01:24:00,069 --> 01:24:01,489
I have a favor to ask.

1040
01:24:01,989 --> 01:24:04,489
There's a certain excitement
that the word "first" gives you.

1041
01:24:04,569 --> 01:24:06,409
Like first love.
What about first imprisonment?

1042
01:24:18,499 --> 01:24:21,089
Hey. Joon-dol. This isn't a house.
It's a pigsty.

1043
01:24:24,179 --> 01:24:25,719
I need to submit this today.

1044
01:24:29,309 --> 01:24:30,719
What's Je-hyeok Kim's cell number?

1045
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:33,889
And why won't they give my bro a single?

1046
01:24:41,319 --> 01:24:44,739
"My bro"? Is Je-hyeok your brother?
I'm your brother.

1047
01:24:44,819 --> 01:24:46,699
What's your problem?

1048
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:49,829
You can finally be useful
to your little brother!

1049
01:24:51,079 --> 01:24:53,209
You should thank Je-hyeok Kim.

1050
01:24:53,289 --> 01:24:56,579
Your friend is a superstar.
You're so lucky. That's super cool.

1051
01:24:56,669 --> 01:24:59,039
Hey. I played a little baseball too,
back in the day.

1052
01:24:59,629 --> 01:25:01,589
And honestly,
I was slightly better than Je-hyeok.

1053
01:25:03,469 --> 01:25:05,219
No. You're different.

1054
01:25:05,929 --> 01:25:08,429
You and my bro Je-hyeok are way different.

1055
01:25:08,509 --> 01:25:10,349
How are we different? We're the same.

1056
01:25:11,969 --> 01:25:16,559
You're like crystal.
You're light and fragile, but...

1057
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:18,359
But?

1058
01:25:21,019 --> 01:25:22,109
My bro Je-hyeok...

1059
01:25:22,189 --> 01:25:24,189
Je-hyeok will overcome it
because he never gives up.

1060
01:25:25,569 --> 01:25:26,949
He's the man who never gives up.

1061
01:25:31,829 --> 01:25:33,749
So? What's his cell number?

1062
01:25:33,829 --> 01:25:37,499
I want to start with that this week.
Okay? Tell me.

1063
01:25:38,419 --> 01:25:39,499
Please, tell me.

1064
01:25:41,549 --> 01:25:42,499
Please?

1065
01:25:43,509 --> 01:25:44,509
Please, tell me.

1066
01:25:50,299 --> 01:25:54,519
<i>Money isn't hard</i>

1067
01:25:55,309 --> 01:25:59,439
<i>Money isn't uncomfortable</i>

1068
01:26:00,059 --> 01:26:03,439
<i>Money helps us</i>

1069
01:26:03,529 --> 01:26:07,609
<i>Money protects us</i>

1070
01:26:09,029 --> 01:26:11,409
The law protects and helps us?

1071
01:26:12,369 --> 01:26:14,539
What a freaking joke.

1072
01:26:15,539 --> 01:26:17,659
Whatever. What a crappy world.

1073
01:26:18,419 --> 01:26:22,209
Famous and rich punks
don't get punished in this crappy world.

1074
01:26:28,129 --> 01:26:29,089
Come out, Je-hyeok Kim.

1075
01:26:34,259 --> 01:26:35,429
Come out, you jerk.

1076
01:26:38,849 --> 01:26:41,559
9A2
SEGREGATION CELL

1077
01:26:49,569 --> 01:26:51,569
At least it's a private cell.

1078
01:26:53,909 --> 01:26:55,119
Great.

Justice really does prevail.

1083
01:27:10,009 --> 01:27:11,759
It is so very strange.

1084

What is?

1085
01:27:12,969 --> 01:27:18,059
Kim caused trouble yesterday.
Why was he segregated today?

1086
01:27:18,139 --> 01:27:21,479
Chief Jo is a psycho.

-You okay?
-Sure.

1099

You should've told me.

How did you find out?

1101
01:28:25,999 --> 01:28:26,879
Cho told me.

1102
01:28:27,959 --> 01:28:31,299
Chief Jo is a sly bastard.
You should've told me last night.

1103
01:28:31,919 --> 01:28:34,839
It's okay.
I can cover that much on my own.

1104
01:28:35,719 --> 01:28:37,009
Whatever.

1105
01:28:37,889 --> 01:28:39,349
That's why you're in there?

1106
01:28:41,729 --> 01:28:43,939
And you have money to burn, don't you?

1107
01:28:44,309 --> 01:28:45,649
Then give me some.

1108
01:28:56,409 --> 01:29:00,789
I wish Je-hyeok would rot in there
for just one week. That would rock.

1109
01:29:04,789 --> 01:29:06,079
What?

1110
01:29:06,749 --> 01:29:09,039
Are you that touched
that they served us mackerel?

1111
01:29:09,629 --> 01:29:11,759

That's enough, okay? That's enough.

1124
01:30:10,899 --> 01:30:13,269
Everyone here committed crimes.
They're bad people.

1125
01:30:15,239 --> 01:30:16,149
Okay.

1126
01:30:19,609 --> 01:30:22,739
It's because he said
he's a Hyeon-jong Yang's fan.

1127
01:30:22,829 --> 01:30:24,789
I wanted to steal his fan.

1128
01:30:25,829 --> 01:30:27,869
That old man isn't worth it either.

1129
01:30:29,749 --> 01:30:31,459
He has nine priors.

1130
01:30:32,379 --> 01:30:34,129
He came in for murder this time.

1131
01:30:36,129 --> 01:30:38,089
He stabbed someone walking by 20 times.

1132
01:30:54,729 --> 01:30:56,029
There.

1133
01:30:56,779 --> 01:30:58,699
He must've stabbed him with that.

1134
01:30:59,399 --> 01:31:01,909
Murderer!

1135
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:04,529
Murderer! You evil bastard!

1136
01:31:04,909 --> 01:31:06,289
You evil bastard!

1137
01:31:07,249 --> 01:31:09,459
You evil bastard! Murderer!

1138
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:16,049
He stabbed a person who was breathing
20 times

1139
01:31:16,129 --> 01:31:17,459
for looking at him for no reason.

1140
01:31:21,299 --> 01:31:24,509
Don't trust anyone.
Everyone here is a crook.

1141
01:31:29,059 --> 01:31:31,599
What are we going to do with you?

1142
01:31:31,689 --> 01:31:34,479
Can't you control your temper, you psycho?

1143
01:31:41,279 --> 01:31:42,319
Later.

1144
01:31:51,919 --> 01:31:55,999
SEGREGATION UNIT

1145
01:32:24,779 --> 01:32:26,029
SEOBU DETENTION CENTER

1146
01:32:26,869 --> 01:32:29,289
<i>Seeing the snow makes me want ice cream.</i>

1147
01:32:29,369 --> 01:32:31,079
You can have it once you win your appeal.

1148
01:32:31,159 --> 01:32:32,909
You just need to hang on
for one more week.

1149
01:32:32,999 --> 01:32:35,329
You have one week left.
Hang in there for one more week.

1150
01:32:35,419 --> 01:32:38,129
Hey! Seriously.
What a crappy world this is.

1151
01:32:38,209 --> 01:32:42,379
Some people can beat a person to a pulp
and walk out scot-free.

1152
01:32:42,469 --> 01:32:46,299
You never know. Life is so unpredictable.

1153
01:32:48,049 --> 01:32:50,429
Why aren't you ratting Je-hyeok out?

1154
01:32:50,519 --> 01:32:53,389
How is there no news about him
beating up a person?

1155
01:32:53,979 --> 01:32:57,439
This is such a strange place.
It isn't a place for people to live.

1156
01:33:00,529 --> 01:33:02,609
Give me a knife, you shit. A knife.

1157
01:33:02,689 --> 01:33:04,739
I can't get you a knife.

1158
01:33:04,819 --> 01:33:07,279
<i>I'll end up getting segregated
if I'm caught just holding it.</i>

1159
01:33:07,369 --> 01:33:10,539
<i>I will board the Ark of Salvation</i>

1160
01:33:10,869 --> 01:33:14,159
Dong-ho, what's wrong? Breathe.

1161
01:33:14,249 --> 01:33:15,919
Chief Jo.

1162
01:33:16,669 --> 01:33:19,089
Please call an ambulance.

1163
01:33:23,589 --> 01:33:25,469
<i>Wing 7! Inspection!</i>

1164
01:33:27,049 --> 01:33:30,009
<i>When you get out,
you'll never see these people again.</i>

1165
01:33:30,099 --> 01:33:32,849
That Errand Boy is a total thug too.
He's a real punk.

1166
01:33:33,099 --> 01:33:36,979
<i>Pro baseball player Je-hyeok Kim's appeal
begins today at 11 a.m.</i>

1167
01:33:37,059 --> 01:33:39,519
<i>It's the most important day of your life,</i>

1168
01:33:40,859 --> 01:33:42,029
<i>so hang on for one more day.</i>

1169
01:33:45,069 --> 01:33:47,319
<i>Good luck, Je-hyeok.</i>
