1
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,021
Who's there?!

2
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:04,039
Who's there?!

3
00:01:45,128 --> 00:01:47,195
What do you want?!

4
00:02:29,557 --> 00:02:32,172
<i>Some say
the world will end in fire. </i>

5
00:02:33,502 --> 00:02:35,454
<i>Some say in ice... </i>

6
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:41,079
From what I've tasted of desire,
I hold with those who favor fire.

7
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:46,007
But if I had to perish twice...

8
00:02:47,753 --> 00:00:00,000
I think I know enough of hate,

9
00:02:50,390 --> 00:00:00,000
To say that,
for destruction,

10
00:02:52,587 --> 00:02:56,980
Ice,
is also great.

11
00:02:59,076 --> 00:03:00,737
And would suffice.

12
00:03:01,694 --> 00:00:00,000
You know,
I've got an english final.

13
00:03:04,993 --> 00:03:07,052
I gotta focus.

14
00:03:21,484 --> 00:03:23,365
Marry me.

15
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:24,991
No.

16
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,093
Marry me.

17
00:03:40,382 --> 00:03:42,053
Change me.

18
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:52,120
Okey I will if you marry me,
It's called a compromise.

19
00:03:56,862 --> 00:00:00,000
It's just called coercion.

20
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:01,019
It's not fair.

21
00:04:02,388 --> 00:00:00,000
Marriage is just...

22
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:06,995
Is a piece of paper.

23
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:11,985
Where I am from,
it's the way one says, "I love you".

24
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:17,094
Where I come from,
at my age...

25
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:21,556
It's the way one says,
"I just got knocked up".

26
00:04:25,343 --> 00:04:29,100
So, you're worried about
what people will think.

27
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:32,818
You know, it's two out of three
marriages end in divorce.

28
00:04:35,257 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, I think you'll find
the...

29
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:42,238
Vampire, human divorce rate
is a little lower.

30
00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:49,084
Just marry me.

31
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:54,871
I can't.

32
00:04:56,865 --> 00:04:58,879
I have to be back at four.

33
00:05:22,327 --> 00:00:00,000
Four o'clock on the dot.

34
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,493
That kid trying to brown nose me
now or something?

35
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:32,532
He has a name.
And now he's too punctual for you?

36
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:41,717
Okey...

37
00:05:43,417 --> 00:00:00,000
You understand
why you're being punished, right?

38
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:50,311
- I know, I put you through hell.
- Yes, you did.

39
00:05:52,229 --> 00:00:00,000
But I have other reasons,
for grounding you.

40
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,307
Like...

41
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:04,885
I just want you to get
some separation from him.

42
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:08,891
Dad, there is nothing
you can say.

43
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:13,571
Edward is in my life.

44
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:18,249
Yeah, I'm gathering that.

45
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:24,746
So, alright. How about this?
I'll make you a deal.

46
00:06:26,220 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not grounded anymore,
if...

47
00:06:31,065 --> 00:00:00,000
You use your
new found freedom...

48
00:06:32,511 --> 00:00:00,000
to see some
of your other friends too,

49
00:06:34,724 --> 00:00:00,000
Like...
Like Jacob.

50
00:06:38,672 --> 00:00:00,000
He's going through
a really tough time right now,

51
00:06:40,344 --> 00:06:42,524
His Dad's
really worried about him.

52
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:44,999
I remember
when that was you.

53
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:50,645
You needed a friend,
Jake was there.

54
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,053
<i>Hey, it's Jake.
Leave a message. </i>

55
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:02,035
Jacob hadn't talk to me
in weeks.

56
00:07:03,120 --> 00:00:00,000
I wanted to fix it,
he just...

57
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,756
He wouldn't give me
the chance.

58
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:22,347
<i>"I miss you too.
Doesn't change anything. "</i>

59
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,889
You scared me.

60
00:08:04,633 --> 00:00:00,000
You're going now
to the reservation.

61
00:08:06,935 --> 00:08:10,517
How'd you --?
Alice...

62
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:16,107
Hey,
did you do this to my truck?

63
00:08:16,507 --> 00:00:00,000
Bella, you have to understand.
Your safety is everything to me.

64
00:08:20,432 --> 00:00:00,000
Jacob is not gonna hurt me!

65
00:08:21,895 --> 00:00:00,000
Not intentionally,
but the wolves have no control...

66
00:08:24,810 --> 00:00:00,000
Edward!
I have...

67
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:30,623
Until graduation,
to see him.

68
00:08:33,383 --> 00:00:00,000
And I'll be one of you,
and he'll hate me forever.

69
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,457
I'm sorry.

70
00:08:54,565 --> 00:00:00,000
- Hey.
- Just in time. Alright, check it out.

71
00:08:56,387 --> 00:00:00,000
- Alright, let's see what you got.
- My fellow students.

72
00:08:58,787 --> 00:00:00,000
- Cool.
- Right?

73
00:08:59,619 --> 00:00:00,000
- Wow.
- Okey, right? -- Cute.

74
00:09:00,989 --> 00:00:00,000
We are the future.
Anything is possible...

75
00:09:03,864 --> 00:00:00,000
... If you just believe.
- Nice.

76
00:09:05,548 --> 00:00:00,000
Blah, blah, blah...

77
00:09:07,206 --> 00:00:00,000
- Perfect.
- And got your self a speech.

78
00:09:09,086 --> 00:00:00,000
No, this will be my speech.

79
00:09:10,205 --> 00:00:00,000
When I want everyone to throw
diplomas at my head.

80
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,285
So...
Thank you.

81
00:09:15,984 --> 00:00:00,000
Ya gotta embrace the cliches,
Jess.

82
00:09:17,533 --> 00:00:00,000
They have the bread and butter
of all valedictorians.

83
00:09:20,043 --> 00:00:00,000
And that is why
you are not valedictorian.

84
00:09:22,594 --> 00:00:00,000
And Jess doesn't need cliches.
Speech is gonna be epic.

85
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:28,802
Epic? It'll change lives.

86
00:09:29,773 --> 00:00:00,000
I decided to throw a party.

87
00:09:31,538 --> 00:00:00,000
After all, how many times
we gonna graduate high school?

88
00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:36,853
A party? At your place?

89
00:09:38,496 --> 00:00:00,000
- I've never seen your house.
- No one's ever seen their house.

90
00:09:41,457 --> 00:00:00,000
A nother party, Alice?

91
00:09:43,425 --> 00:00:00,000
- It'll be fun.
- Yeah.

92
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:47,017
That's what you said last time.

93
00:09:51,822 --> 00:00:00,000
- Hey, Angela.
- Yes.

94
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:54,601
Do you need some help
with those?

95
00:10:24,368 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you know what she saw.
Tell me.

96
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:28,473
It was nothing.

97
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:31,462
You looked worried.

98
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:35,984
Just that everyone would notice
how strange Alice is.

99
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,093
I think that ship sailed
long ago.

100
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:43,589
I wonder what's wrong.

101
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,756
There's someone missing
in Seattle, over a year ago.

102
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:49,480
Charlie is doing what he can,
but...

103
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:54,362
Do you know something
about this?

104
00:10:57,511 --> 00:11:00,544
We've been tracking the situation
in Seattle for a while.

105
00:11:00,939 --> 00:00:00,000
Unexplained disappearances,
killings...

106
00:11:04,571 --> 00:00:00,000
If the situation gets anymore
conspicuous,

107
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:08,616
the Volturi will step in.

108
00:11:10,788 --> 00:00:00,000
If they go to Seattle,
they can come here.

109
00:11:13,040 --> 00:00:00,000
- They can see I'm still human.
- We won't get that far.

110
00:11:16,413 --> 00:11:18,638
But we'll go to Seattle
if we have to.

111
00:11:20,632 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll fax these down
the first thing.

112
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:23,373
Thank you.

113
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,552
- Hey.
- Hey.

114
00:11:28,032 --> 00:00:00,000
- You're ready for dinner?
- Yeah.

115
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:33,929
It is still just...
you and I, alright?

116
00:11:34,521 --> 00:11:36,330
No, I'm just dropping her off.

117
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:39,932
- See you later.
- Bye.

118
00:11:41,432 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh...
Bella.

119
00:11:43,521 --> 00:00:00,000
My parents wanted to
remind you about the...

120
00:11:45,409 --> 00:00:00,000
Airline ticket
you got for your birthday.

121
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:49,305
What airline ticket?

122
00:11:50,782 --> 00:00:00,000
A round trip ticket
to see Mom in Florida.

123
00:11:53,428 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow, that was generous.

124
00:11:55,733 --> 00:00:00,000
And it expires soon, they say
you might wanna use it this weekend.

125
00:11:58,313 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, I can't just drop
everything and go.

126
00:12:01,937 --> 00:12:04,807
It might be your last chance
to see her before you graduate.

127
00:12:05,299 --> 00:00:00,000
Well. It might not be
a bad idea.

128
00:12:07,778 --> 00:00:00,000
get out of the town
for a couple of days,

129
00:12:09,034 --> 00:12:11,313
get some distance.

130
00:12:12,608 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah,
I wouldn't mind seeing Mom...

131
00:12:15,649 --> 00:00:00,000
As long as you
use the companion ticket.

132
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:20,342
Wait, just two tickets?

133
00:12:22,513 --> 00:12:26,458
Super,
That makes me really happy.

134
00:12:28,946 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I did wanna see my Mom. </i>

135
00:12:31,362 --> 00:12:34,807
<i>I wanted to know that her life
was full by satisfying</i>

136
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:38,769
Aren't you gonna miss this?

137
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:44,010
Don't you just feel the vitamin D
soaking up in your pores?

138
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:49,145
Yeah, I'm gonna miss this.

139
00:12:51,132 --> 00:12:54,165
You know, colleges in Florida
are a lot sunnier.

140
00:12:58,479 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just saying,
if you go to university of Alaska...

141
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:02,785
I'm never gonna see you.

142
00:13:07,869 --> 00:13:10,037
They have a really great
science program.

143
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:13,154
You mean Edward program.

144
00:13:15,555 --> 00:00:00,000
The way he watches you...

145
00:13:17,864 --> 00:00:00,000
It's like he's willing to leap
in front of you,

146
00:13:19,395 --> 00:13:21,464
and take a bullet
or something.

147
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:23,896
Is that a bad thing?

148
00:13:24,784 --> 00:00:00,000
It's an intense thing.

149
00:13:27,296 --> 00:13:29,012
You're different with him.

150
00:13:30,381 --> 00:13:33,985
If he moves, you move.
Like magnets.

151
00:13:35,496 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know, we're just...

152
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:40,407
In love.
I get it.

153
00:13:41,353 --> 00:00:00,000
I just want to make sure,

154
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:44,706
you're making
the right choices for you.

155
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,435
You know, cause you're the one
who's gonna have to live with him.

156
00:13:52,251 --> 00:13:55,249
Alright, enough with the heavy.

157
00:14:02,093 --> 00:00:00,000
- Mom.
- Congraduation.

158
00:14:05,119 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't want you
to spending you're money.

159
00:14:06,664 --> 00:14:08,417
I didn't, come on.

160
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,768
Are these all our old trip T-shirts?
- Emm. -- Get out!

161
00:14:26,230 --> 00:00:00,000
I saved'em all.
I thought they'd make a good quilt.

162
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:30,847
To keep you warm up in Alaska.

163
00:14:31,601 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember this one?
Ensanada.

164
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,380
- The snake pit.
- Yep.

165
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:39,319
But this one is my favourite.
Here...

166
00:14:40,158 --> 00:00:00,000
The three-headed lobster
in Maine.

167
00:14:42,657 --> 00:00:00,000
- This is amazing.
- No, honey. I'm glad you've like it.

168
00:14:45,323 --> 00:00:00,000
I just figured, you know,
when you get older, have kids,

169
00:14:47,430 --> 00:00:00,000
We can add to it.
Maybe go visit...

170
00:14:48,882 --> 00:00:00,000
the world's largest catsup bottle
or something.

171
00:14:51,197 --> 00:14:53,203
- Thanks
- Oh...

172
00:14:55,099 --> 00:14:56,863
I'm glad you like it.

173
00:14:57,408 --> 00:15:01,356
I just thought, you should have
a little piece of me, up there in Alaska.

174
00:15:03,426 --> 00:15:05,747
- Mom.
- Yeah.

175
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:14,388
- I miss you.
- Oh, honey. I miss you too.

176
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,778
You sure this is
where you saw her?

177
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:36,796
She's almost here.

178
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:50,845
On your left!

179
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:29,695
Wait!
She's in their territory.

180
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:32,885
She'll get away!

181
00:16:34,136 --> 00:16:35,660
No she won't!

182
00:17:11,285 --> 00:17:12,949
Emmett, no!

183
00:17:45,802 --> 00:17:47,409
Did you regret going?

184
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:50,550
No.

185
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:56,484
It was really great to see my mom.
Just really hard saying goodbye.

186
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,233
- It doesn't have to be goodbye.
- Is that why you ask me to go?

187
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,877
You thought
I was gonna change my mind.

188
00:18:05,322 --> 00:18:07,614
I'm always hoping for that.

189
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:10,511
What?

190
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,733
If I asked you to stay in the car,
would you?

191
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:22,589
Of course not.

192
00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:35,892
Hey.

193
00:18:37,352 --> 00:18:41,364
- Charlie said you left town.
- Yeah. To visit my Mom, why?

194
00:18:42,165 --> 00:18:44,175
Just checking to see
if you're still human.

195
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:47,470
I'm coming here to warn you.

196
00:18:48,205 --> 00:00:00,000
If your kind
come on our land again...

197
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:51,972
Wait, what?

198
00:18:54,595 --> 00:18:57,968
- You didn't tell her?
- Just leave it alone, Jacob.

199
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,376
Tell me what?

200
00:19:01,376 --> 00:00:00,000
Emmett and Paul
had a misunderstanding,

201
00:19:04,690 --> 00:00:00,000
there is nothing
to worry about.

202
00:19:06,427 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen to you.

203
00:19:08,233 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you lie
to get her out of town, too?

204
00:19:10,301 --> 00:00:00,000
You should leave.
Now.

205
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:16,329
She has a right to know.

206
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,572
She is the one
the red-head wants.

207
00:19:20,856 --> 00:19:22,574
Victoria?

208
00:19:23,558 --> 00:00:00,000
- Alices's vision.
- I was trying to protect you.

209
00:19:28,591 --> 00:19:30,770
By lying to me.

210
00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:35,551
Okey. We're gonna talk
about this, but...

211
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,329
You!

212
00:19:37,892 --> 00:19:39,700
Why haven't you
called me back?

213
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:45,234
I had nothing to say.

214
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:49,658
- Well, I have tons. Hold on.
- Hey.

215
00:19:51,546 --> 00:19:52,748
Bella.

216
00:19:53,203 --> 00:19:56,122
- Edward, you have to trust me.
- I do trust you.

217
00:19:57,298 --> 00:19:59,055
It's him I don't trust.

218
00:20:10,255 --> 00:00:00,000
Lose the grin, Jacob.
We're just going for a ride.

219
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:15,286
Hold on tight.

220
00:20:28,755 --> 00:20:30,716
Are you sure,
this is a good idea?

221
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:35,237
I'm a "vampire girl",
remember?

222
00:20:36,196 --> 00:00:00,000
- Look who's back.
- Whatup, Bella?

223
00:20:38,805 --> 00:00:00,000
- Quil, you too?
- Yep. Finally made the pack.

224
00:20:42,524 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm glad you're here, Bella.

225
00:20:43,601 --> 00:00:00,000
Maybe we can get a break from
Jake's obsessive inner monologue.

226
00:20:46,275 --> 00:00:00,000
"I wish Bella would call".

227
00:20:47,861 --> 00:00:00,000
- "I wish Bella wouldn't call".
- "Maybe I should call Bella".

228
00:20:50,495 --> 00:20:52,618
"Maybe I should call Bella
and hang up".

229
00:20:53,632 --> 00:20:55,567
Alright, you can shut up now.

230
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:02,038
Bella, this is Leah Clearwater.
Harry's daughter.

231
00:21:02,643 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey.
I'm really sorry about your father.

232
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:08,903
If you're here to torture Jacob
some more, feel free to leave.

233
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:13,959
Fun, isn't she?

234
00:21:14,560 --> 00:00:00,000
- Bella... Hi.
- Hey.

235
00:21:17,512 --> 00:00:00,000
I was wondering when we'd see
your face around here again.

236
00:21:20,268 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, same here.

237
00:21:22,209 --> 00:00:00,000
Sam, we're good?

238
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:26,759
We're good. She won't be getting
through our line anytime soon.

239
00:21:38,085 --> 00:00:00,000
So, when did Leah
joined the pack?

240
00:21:40,862 --> 00:00:00,000
Around when her Dad died.
Her brother Seth, also phased.

241
00:21:45,445 --> 00:00:00,000
He's only fifteen.
One of the youngest we've had.

242
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:52,582
Sam keeps him home studying,
but he's chomping at the bit.

243
00:21:53,908 --> 00:21:55,777
Wish it was Leah
who'd stay home.

244
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:58,225
Come on,
don't be such a guy.

245
00:21:58,921 --> 00:22:04,821
No, it's... It's not a chick thing.
It's... You know, a triangle thing.

246
00:22:05,101 --> 00:22:08,928
We all have to live
the Leah, Sam, Emily pain-fest.

247
00:22:10,244 --> 00:00:00,000
Wolf telepathy, remember?

248
00:22:12,356 --> 00:00:00,000
So, Sam dumps Leah
for Emily?

249
00:22:15,117 --> 00:00:00,000
It wasn't like that.
Sam hates himself for hurting Leah.

250
00:22:20,274 --> 00:22:22,714
But, Emily was The One.

251
00:22:23,553 --> 00:22:26,227
Yeah, I guess it's sort of
chooses you sometimes.

252
00:22:28,445 --> 00:22:32,845
It's more than some crush, Bella.
Sam imprinted on Emily.

253
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,160
Do I want to know what that is?

254
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:49,661
Imprinting on someone
is like...

255
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:56,150
Like when you see her,
everything changes.

256
00:22:57,613 --> 00:23:01,683
All of a sudden, it's not
gravity holding you to the planet.

257
00:23:02,476 --> 00:23:03,933
It's her.

258
00:23:04,656 --> 00:23:10,056
Nothing else matters.
You would do anything...

259
00:23:11,332 --> 00:23:14,204
Be anything for her.

260
00:23:16,097 --> 00:23:18,668
It sounds like
you know the feeling.

261
00:23:22,244 --> 00:23:27,344
Have you...
imprinted on someone?

262
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,877
You'd know if I had.

263
00:23:38,465 --> 00:23:41,234
I just have a direct line
to Sam's thoughts.

264
00:23:43,245 --> 00:23:47,219
So for now, you're...
still you.

265
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:53,864
- And you're still you.
- Yeah.

266
00:23:59,327 --> 00:24:01,407
Until graduation.

267
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,097
graduation?

268
00:24:05,407 --> 00:00:00,000
You knew
this was gonna happen.

269
00:24:07,122 --> 00:24:08,872
Not in a month!

270
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:15,057
I mean, not before you've...
you've even lived!

271
00:24:16,097 --> 00:24:18,331
Or before I could...

272
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:26,466
For a second, just a second,
I thought...

273
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,675
But he's got his hooks in you
so deep.

274
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:35,241
- I decided this, not him.
- Bella, they're not even a live!

275
00:24:36,616 --> 00:24:38,592
It makes me sick!

276
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,818
Better you really be dead
than one of them.

277
00:24:56,775 --> 00:24:58,707
I can't believe you said that.

278
00:25:03,024 --> 00:00:00,000
Edward was right,
I shouldn't have come.

279
00:25:05,266 --> 00:25:08,459
Bella, come on.
Please.

280
00:25:11,521 --> 00:25:13,458
I'm sorry.

281
00:26:22,170 --> 00:00:00,000
You know...

282
00:26:23,893 --> 00:26:26,404
Edward could at least
respect meal times.

283
00:26:27,340 --> 00:00:00,000
I was just with Jake.

284
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:30,891
Oh...
Good.

285
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:41,272
I'll just give you two
some privacy then.

286
00:26:43,355 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey.

287
00:26:44,037 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you understand
how worried I've been?

288
00:26:45,808 --> 00:00:00,000
I was perfectly safe.

289
00:26:47,131 --> 00:26:49,617
I almost break the treaty
to make sure of it.

290
00:26:50,592 --> 00:26:53,021
- I know, I smell like a dog. I'm sorry.
- No, no. Something's wrong.

291
00:27:00,722 --> 00:27:03,788
- Edward, what's wrong?
- Someone's been in here.

292
00:27:09,683 --> 00:00:00,000
Who was it?
Someone we know?

293
00:27:13,027 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a stranger.
I didn't recognize his scent.

294
00:27:16,152 --> 00:00:00,000
A nomad passing through?

295
00:27:17,759 --> 00:00:00,000
A passer-by wouldn't have left
Bella's father alive.

296
00:27:20,451 --> 00:27:23,384
His scent disappeared about five miles
south of Bella's house.

297
00:27:25,192 --> 00:27:28,492
- Someone's orchestrating this.
- Victoria?

298
00:27:29,292 --> 00:00:00,000
- I would've seen her deciding.
- It has to be the Volturi.

299
00:27:32,930 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think
it's the Volturi either.

300
00:27:35,644 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been watching
Aro's decisions, too.

301
00:27:37,309 --> 00:00:00,000
So we keep looking.

302
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:41,305
We also take shifts,
guarding Bella at her house.

303
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,690
- A nother protection detail?
- Rosalie.

304
00:27:45,909 --> 00:00:00,000
No, she's right.

305
00:27:47,445 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't protect me,
watch my dad...

306
00:27:50,261 --> 00:00:00,000
and search for the intruder.

307
00:27:51,944 --> 00:00:00,000
- And for Victoria.
- And keep yourselves fed.

308
00:27:55,535 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not leaving you here
defenseless.

309
00:27:57,277 --> 00:27:59,325
Well, I'm not gonna
let you starve.

310
00:28:00,411 --> 00:00:00,000
And I wouldn't be unprotected,
I have...

311
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:06,257
What?

312
00:28:13,494 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoever it was,
he left his stink behind.

313
00:28:16,454 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll be hard to miss
when we cross it again.

314
00:28:19,232 --> 00:28:22,310
- We'll handle it from here.
- We don't need you to handle anything.

315
00:28:23,112 --> 00:00:00,000
- Or anyone.
- I could care less what you need.

316
00:28:26,140 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, we're done here.

317
00:28:28,023 --> 00:00:00,000
- No, you're done here.
- Stop!

318
00:28:30,907 --> 00:28:34,228
I'm tired of this.
From now on I'm Switzerland, Okay?

319
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:40,350
<i>Edward hated the idea,
but it wasn't about rivalry anymore. </i>

320
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:43,673
<i>It was about my safety,
and Charlie's. </i>

321
00:28:44,844 --> 00:28:48,327
<i>In the days that followed
I got them to at least try to work together. </i>

322
00:28:54,258 --> 00:28:56,718
<i>The wolves took over
so the Cullen's can hunt. </i>

323
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:02,470
<i>It wasn't exactly
an easy alliance. </i>

324
00:29:19,006 --> 00:29:20,644
Doesn't he own a shirt?

325
00:29:25,543 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm good here,
you should go.

326
00:29:27,554 --> 00:29:32,860
- I'm not gonna be going long.
- Don't rush. You need to hunt.

327
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:51,245
Maybe you rush a little bit.

328
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,570
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hi.

329
00:30:09,339 --> 00:00:00,000
So, whaddaya wanna do today?
Bike, hike, hang?

330
00:30:13,684 --> 00:30:16,460
Your call.
Or we're going to a party tonight.

331
00:30:19,483 --> 00:30:23,739
You sure this is okay?
I really hate being a party crasher.

332
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,243
Technically,
you're a Council Meeting crasher.

333
00:30:27,966 --> 00:30:33,066
See. The Council leaders,
Dad, Quil's grandpa, and Sue Clearwater.

334
00:30:33,698 --> 00:00:00,000
She took over for Harry
when he died.

335
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:37,386
Okay, I should not be here.

336
00:30:38,205 --> 00:00:00,000
You're okay.
I thought...

337
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:44,862
I mean, they thought it would be
good for you to hear the histories.

338
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,600
The histories? The tribe's histories?
Aren't they secret?

339
00:30:51,663 --> 00:30:55,220
We all got a role to play.
And you're a part of this.

340
00:30:55,950 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, it's the first time Seth,
Leah and Quil are hearing them, too.

341
00:30:59,016 --> 00:31:02,414
But you are the first outsider.
Ever.

342
00:31:04,551 --> 00:31:06,345
If I haven't known that,
I wouldn't believe you.

343
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,974
- And would've dressed better.
- Jake.

344
00:31:12,038 --> 00:00:00,000
- Hey.
- It's about time, you got here.

345
00:31:14,997 --> 00:00:00,000
Paul's been hoovering the grub.
But, I saved you some burgers.

346
00:31:18,148 --> 00:00:00,000
Good looking out, Bro.

347
00:31:20,373 --> 00:00:00,000
Bella, this is Seth Clearwater,
Leah's brother.

348
00:31:23,371 --> 00:00:00,000
- Newest member of the pack.
- Newest, bestest, brightest.

349
00:31:27,473 --> 00:31:29,114
And slowest.

350
00:31:31,783 --> 00:31:33,992
- Come on. Your dad's about to start.
- Alright.

351
00:31:36,293 --> 00:31:39,368
The Quileutes have been a small tribe
from the beginning...

352
00:31:40,492 --> 00:31:43,098
But we've always had magic in
our blood.

353
00:31:45,246 --> 00:00:00,000
We were great spirit warriors...

354
00:31:47,624 --> 00:31:52,724
Shape shifters,
that transform into the powerful wolf.

355
00:31:54,190 --> 00:00:00,000
This enabled us to scare off
our enemies,

356
00:31:57,789 --> 00:32:00,395
and protect our tribe.

357
00:32:01,978 --> 00:32:06,978
One day our warriors
came across a creature...

358
00:32:08,068 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It looked like a man,
but it was hard like stone, </i>

359
00:32:13,168 --> 00:32:15,524
<i>and cold as ice... </i>

360
00:32:35,154 --> 00:00:00,000
Our warriors' sharp teeth,
finally tore it apart...

361
00:32:39,322 --> 00:32:43,160
But only fire
would completely destroy it.

362
00:32:43,942 --> 00:32:47,733
They lived in fear,
the Cold Man was not alone.

363
00:32:48,955 --> 00:32:50,579
And they were right.

364
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:57,782
<i>She took her vengeance out
on the village. </i>

365
00:33:00,265 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Our elder chief,
Taha Aki, </i>

366
00:33:02,616 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>was the only spirit warrior left
to save the tribe, </i>

367
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:08,893
<i>after his son was killed. </i>

368
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:23,879
<i>Taha Aki's Third Wife could sees
that he would lose... </i>

369
00:33:24,915 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>The Third Wife
was no magical being, </i>

370
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,640
<i>no special powers, but one... </i>

371
00:33:33,176 --> 00:33:35,057
Courage.

372
00:33:45,949 --> 00:00:00,000
The Third Wife's sacrifice
distracted the Cold Woman,

373
00:33:49,256 --> 00:33:52,890
long enough for Taha Aki
to destroy her.

374
00:33:53,396 --> 00:33:55,531
She saved the tribe.

375
00:33:56,122 --> 00:33:59,412
Over time,
our enemies have disappeared.

376
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:02,268
But one remains...

377
00:34:03,672 --> 00:34:05,817
The Cold Ones.

378
00:34:08,031 --> 00:00:00,000
Our magic awakens
when they near.

379
00:34:10,573 --> 00:34:14,757
And we sense it now,
we feel the threat in our blood.

380
00:34:16,426 --> 00:34:18,600
Something terrible is coming.

381
00:34:20,603 --> 00:34:25,703
And we must all be ready.
All of us.

382
00:34:52,703 --> 00:34:54,578
What did you do to me?

383
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:03,015
- I'm so...
- Yeah, I know...

384
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:06,063
We'll find you someone
to drink.

385
00:35:14,276 --> 00:35:17,555
Just try not to get killed,
will you?

386
00:35:20,392 --> 00:35:22,514
I'm gonna need numbers.

387
00:35:23,911 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Seattle is in a state of terror... </i>

388
00:35:26,030 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Police are baffled by the
escalating murders and disappearances. </i>

389
00:35:29,961 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Theories range from a vicious new gang
to a wildly active serial killer... </i>

390
00:35:34,307 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>- Reporting live, Dawn Chubai. CNN.
- It's getting worse. </i>

391
00:35:36,832 --> 00:00:00,000
We're going to have
to do something.

392
00:35:38,949 --> 00:00:00,000
It takes more than one of our kind
to cause the damage they're reporting.

393
00:35:43,168 --> 00:00:00,000
Quite a few more.
They're undisciplined, conspicuous...

394
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,979
It's a Newborns.

395
00:35:50,255 --> 00:00:00,000
What, like new vampires?

396
00:35:52,120 --> 00:00:00,000
In their first few months
after the change.

397
00:35:54,305 --> 00:00:00,000
That's when we're at our most
uncontrollable,

398
00:35:56,817 --> 00:00:00,000
vicious, insane with thirst.

399
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:03,584
Something to look forward to.

400
00:36:05,078 --> 00:36:08,615
No one has trained these newborns,
but this isn't random.

401
00:36:09,029 --> 00:36:10,890
Someone's creating an army.

402
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:13,723
Oh, now we definitely
going to Seattle.

403
00:36:14,657 --> 00:00:00,000
An Army of vampires?

404
00:36:16,687 --> 00:00:00,000
And they've been created
to fight someone.

405
00:36:18,361 --> 00:00:00,000
We're the only clan
even close to Seattle.

406
00:36:20,271 --> 00:00:00,000
Regardless,
of who are they were may,

407
00:36:21,475 --> 00:36:23,834
if we don't put a stop to them,
the Volturi will.

408
00:36:24,986 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm surprised
they've let it go on this long.

409
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:28,843
Maybe they're behind it.

410
00:36:29,843 --> 00:00:00,000
In Italy,
I read Aro's mind...

411
00:36:32,589 --> 00:00:00,000
He wants me and Alice
to join him...

412
00:36:34,306 --> 00:00:00,000
He knows we'd never choose him
as long as our family is still alive.

413
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:40,300
An army
could solve that for him.

414
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,368
Hey.
Did you eat dinner yet?

415
00:36:54,275 --> 00:36:56,699
Um... no...
I haven't.

416
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:04,605
This kid Riley Biers,
disappeared over a year ago.

417
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:09,091
And his poor parents been papering
Seattle with these things ever since.

418
00:37:10,601 --> 00:37:12,516
You think
they should just give up?

419
00:37:15,298 --> 00:37:18,270
I wouldn't.
If it were you...

420
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,053
Not ever.

421
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:29,963
<i>I have to figure out
what to tell people... </i>

422
00:37:30,895 --> 00:37:33,286
Whu I won't be home
for Christmases.

423
00:37:34,601 --> 00:37:37,063
Why I won't visit.

424
00:37:38,662 --> 00:37:40,978
Why they'll never see me again.

425
00:37:41,424 --> 00:37:46,025
After a few decades,
everyone you know will be dead.

426
00:37:48,094 --> 00:37:50,107
Problem solved.

427
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,159
Why are you so against me
becoming like you?

428
00:37:57,862 --> 00:37:59,857
I've told you.

429
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:06,763
Be honest with me.
There's more.

430
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:12,285
I know the consequences,
of this choice you're making.

431
00:38:16,993 --> 00:38:22,844
I've lived through it,
and to let you suffer that.

432
00:38:24,450 --> 00:00:00,000
You believe I have a soul...

433
00:38:27,323 --> 00:38:29,338
I don't.

434
00:38:31,506 --> 00:38:36,206
But to risk yours, just for the sake
of never having to lose you.

435
00:38:38,605 --> 00:38:41,281
It's the most selfish thing
I'll ever do.

436
00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:49,425
I thought, maybe you were afraid
that I'll be too different.

437
00:38:51,445 --> 00:00:00,000
Unlike. I won't be, you know...
warm.

438
00:38:55,365 --> 00:38:57,413
And won't smell the same.

439
00:39:06,347 --> 00:39:09,250
You'll always be my Bella.

440
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:32,968
My Bella, just less fragile.

441
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:45,430
Gosh, it's so pretty here.

442
00:39:50,966 --> 00:39:54,141
So, Alice is planning
a big graduation party.

443
00:39:55,146 --> 00:39:56,913
Which you're invited to.

444
00:40:00,858 --> 00:40:03,845
Yeah,
I figured that.

445
00:40:11,293 --> 00:40:12,548
What?

446
00:40:14,366 --> 00:40:16,582
I just wanted to do this
differently.

447
00:40:17,402 --> 00:40:18,833
Smoother.

448
00:40:20,312 --> 00:40:22,287
But now, I'm out of time.

449
00:40:23,631 --> 00:40:25,009
To what?

450
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:28,115
You need to hear the truth,
Bella.

451
00:40:28,915 --> 00:40:31,448
Understand all your options.

452
00:40:32,902 --> 00:40:34,727
You need to know...

453
00:40:36,114 --> 00:40:38,869
That I'm in love with you.

454
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:43,177
And I want you to choose me,
instead of him.

455
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,743
I thought you understood.

456
00:40:49,898 --> 00:00:00,000
- I don't feel that way for you.
- I don't buy it.

457
00:40:52,445 --> 00:40:54,061
What don't you buy?

458
00:40:55,960 --> 00:00:00,000
That's how I feel.

459
00:40:58,035 --> 00:41:01,882
You feel something else for me,
you just won't admit it.

460
00:41:02,887 --> 00:41:07,987
So I'm not giving up.
I'm gonna fight for you.

461
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:13,106
Until your heart stops beating.

462
00:41:13,737 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, then you're not gonna have
to fight for long.

463
00:41:15,430 --> 00:00:00,000
You're rushing into it because
you're afraid you'll change your mind.

464
00:41:17,827 --> 00:41:19,330
No, I'm not.

465
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,248
I know what I want.

466
00:41:24,076 --> 00:41:27,001
You wouldn't have
to change for me, Bella.

467
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:30,360
Or say goodbye to anybody.

468
00:41:31,093 --> 00:41:34,099
I can give you more than him.

469
00:41:34,586 --> 00:41:37,905
I mean, he probably can't even
kiss you without hurting you.

470
00:41:40,328 --> 00:00:00,000
Feel that?

471
00:41:42,718 --> 00:41:47,031
Flesh and blood and warmth.

472
00:42:11,154 --> 00:00:00,000
Edward!

473
00:42:11,910 --> 00:00:00,000
If you ever touch her
against her will again!

474
00:42:14,380 --> 00:00:00,000
- Don't do this!
- She's not sure what she wants!

475
00:42:16,347 --> 00:00:00,000
- Don't do this!
- Well, let me give you a clue!

476
00:42:17,826 --> 00:00:00,000
- Wait for her to say the words!
- Fine! And she will!

477
00:42:21,917 --> 00:00:00,000
- Jacob. Just go, okay!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey...

478
00:42:24,922 --> 00:42:29,439
Easy guys, easy.
Let's take it down a notch. Alright?

479
00:42:32,487 --> 00:42:34,108
What's going on?

480
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:39,316
I kissed Bella.

481
00:42:43,215 --> 00:42:45,497
And she broke her hand...

482
00:42:46,821 --> 00:42:49,024
Punching my face.

483
00:42:50,814 --> 00:42:53,206
Total misunderstanding.

484
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,502
It's just a sprain,
should heal fairly quickly.

485
00:43:00,129 --> 00:43:03,093
Trying to walk and chew gum
at the same time again, Bella?

486
00:43:04,544 --> 00:00:00,000
- I punched a werewolf in the face.
- Bad ass...

487
00:43:07,641 --> 00:00:00,000
You're gonna be
one tough little newborn.

488
00:43:10,817 --> 00:43:13,281
Tough enough to take you on.

489
00:43:18,832 --> 00:43:20,978
Don't worry about it.

490
00:43:23,437 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, any Leads?

491
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:29,947
No sign of the intruder. But Victoria
continues to make appearances.

492
00:43:37,455 --> 00:43:40,690
Go blather to someone else
about the joys of becoming a newborn.

493
00:43:44,452 --> 00:43:48,249
Okay.
Rosalie...

494
00:43:50,467 --> 00:43:53,691
I don't understand what I did,
to make you hate me so much.

495
00:43:56,584 --> 00:43:58,455
I don't hate you.

496
00:44:00,852 --> 00:44:03,613
I don't particularly like you,
but...

497
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:12,745
- Bella, I envy you.
- What?

498
00:44:13,977 --> 00:44:16,454
- That's ridiculous.
- No, it's not.

499
00:44:18,513 --> 00:44:21,772
You have a choice.
I didn't.

500
00:44:22,635 --> 00:44:25,949
None of us did. But you do,
and you're choosing wrong.

501
00:44:27,344 --> 00:44:30,457
I don't care how miserable
your human life is.

502
00:44:31,186 --> 00:44:34,368
My life is not miserable.

503
00:44:37,027 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not perfect,
but nobody's life is perfect.

504
00:44:40,652 --> 00:44:44,952
Mine was.
Absolutely perfect.

505
00:44:46,491 --> 00:44:48,740
Everything as I still wanted.

506
00:44:49,611 --> 00:00:00,000
To be married,
with a nice house and a husband...

507
00:44:51,696 --> 00:00:00,000
to kiss me when he came home.

508
00:44:53,778 --> 00:44:55,931
A family of my own.

509
00:44:56,615 --> 00:44:59,615
<i>Royce King was
the most eligible bachelor in town. </i>

510
00:45:01,209 --> 00:45:02,977
<i>I barely knew him. </i>

511
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:11,800
<i>But I was young.
I was in love with the idea of love. </i>

512
00:45:12,807 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>On the last night of my life,
I left a friend's house late. </i>

513
00:45:16,371 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>- I wasn't far from home.
- Here she is. </i>

514
00:45:19,703 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, Rose!
Come over here!

515
00:45:22,704 --> 00:45:24,393
Here, hold this.

516
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:28,733
Hey, come over here.
We've been waiting for you.

517
00:45:30,354 --> 00:45:32,387
Here she is

518
00:45:34,258 --> 00:45:35,474
Royce.

519
00:45:36,609 --> 00:00:00,000
You're drunk.

520
00:45:38,426 --> 00:00:00,000
Isn't she lovely, John?
I told you she was a looker.

521
00:45:41,892 --> 00:00:00,000
It's hard to say
with all those clothes on.

522
00:45:44,812 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you say, Rose?
Why don't we take off a few layers?

523
00:45:49,115 --> 00:45:51,343
Stop it!...

524
00:45:53,586 --> 00:45:56,134
I'll see you tomorrow.
Sober.

525
00:45:57,807 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

526
00:45:59,346 --> 00:46:03,458
- Stop it! Just stop it! Let go! Stop it!
- Comeback! Hey, you'll do as I say!

527
00:46:08,814 --> 00:00:00,000
They left me in the street,
thinking I was dead.

528
00:46:12,209 --> 00:46:14,258
Believe me, I wanted to be.

529
00:46:15,807 --> 00:00:00,000
Carlisle found me,
he smelled all the blood...

530
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:21,212
- Thought he was helping me.
- I'm sorry.

531
00:46:23,985 --> 00:46:26,197
I got my revenge on them.

532
00:46:27,815 --> 00:00:00,000
One at a time.

533
00:46:29,812 --> 00:46:33,203
I saved Royce for last,
so he'd know I was coming.

534
00:46:51,237 --> 00:46:53,843
I was a little theatrical back then.

535
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:04,700
Things got better
after I found Emmett.

536
00:47:07,772 --> 00:47:09,710
But we'll always be this.

537
00:47:13,726 --> 00:47:18,047
Frozen,
never moving forward.

538
00:47:19,459 --> 00:47:23,492
That's what I miss the most,
the possibilities.

539
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:26,488
Sitting on a front porch
somewhere,

540
00:47:27,063 --> 00:00:00,000
Emmett gray haired
by my side,

541
00:47:29,726 --> 00:47:32,512
surrounded by
our grandchildren,

542
00:47:33,698 --> 00:47:35,819
their laughter.

543
00:47:37,446 --> 00:47:40,414
I understand,
that's what you want.

544
00:47:47,224 --> 00:47:50,960
But there's nothing
I'll ever gonna want, more...

545
00:47:52,873 --> 00:47:54,785
than Edward.

546
00:47:55,165 --> 00:47:56,844
You're wrong again.

547
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:02,230
After you've been changed,
there's one thing you'll want more...

548
00:48:03,342 --> 00:48:05,365
One thing you'll kill for...

549
00:48:07,597 --> 00:48:09,342
Blood.

550
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:18,234
What did I say,
about low profile?

551
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:32,506
Something's coming...

552
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:39,214
Something...
Bigger than any of us alone.

553
00:48:40,032 --> 00:48:42,007
And if you can't...

554
00:48:43,146 --> 00:48:45,462
control yourselves...

555
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:49,260
We're all going to die.

556
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,469
What's done is done,
just...

557
00:48:58,814 --> 00:49:01,115
clean up after yourselves.

558
00:49:09,759 --> 00:00:00,000
They've already drawn
too much attention.

559
00:49:12,890 --> 00:00:00,000
So has our "inaction".

560
00:49:15,201 --> 00:49:18,736
Others may begin to question
the Volturi's effectiveness.

561
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,427
Let them.

562
00:49:26,736 --> 00:49:29,055
Maybe we should consult
with Aro.

563
00:49:33,953 --> 00:49:36,326
Aro's decisions
are being watched.

564
00:49:38,401 --> 00:49:40,280
We must decide.

565
00:49:42,374 --> 00:49:46,320
Then decide sister.
It's time.

566
00:49:47,581 --> 00:49:49,448
Yes, it is.

567
00:49:54,263 --> 00:00:00,000
Either we let them do
what they were created for...

568
00:49:58,102 --> 00:49:59,859
Or we end them.

569
00:50:00,888 --> 00:50:03,474
Decisions, decisions...

570
00:50:13,266 --> 00:00:00,000
When we were five,

571
00:50:14,379 --> 00:00:00,000
they asked us what we wanted to be
when we grew up...

572
00:50:17,712 --> 00:00:00,000
Our answers were things like
astronaut, president...

573
00:50:22,371 --> 00:00:00,000
Or in my case, a princess.

574
00:50:25,172 --> 00:00:00,000
When we were ten,
they asked again,

575
00:50:27,711 --> 00:00:00,000
and we answered,
rock star, cowboy,

576
00:50:30,765 --> 00:00:00,000
or in my case,
a gold medalist.

577
00:50:33,603 --> 00:50:37,015
But now that we've grown up,
they want a serious answer.

578
00:50:38,072 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, how about this...

579
00:50:40,862 --> 00:50:42,935
who the hell knows?

580
00:50:46,698 --> 00:00:00,000
This isn't the time to make
hard and fast decisions,

581
00:50:48,899 --> 00:00:00,000
this is the time
to make mistakes.

582
00:50:51,573 --> 00:00:00,000
Take the wrong train
and get stuck somewhere.

583
00:50:54,675 --> 00:50:58,144
Fall in love,
a lot.

584
00:50:58,772 --> 00:00:00,000
Major in philosophy, because there's
no way to make a career out of that.

585
00:51:02,985 --> 00:51:06,500
Change your mind, and change it again,
because nothing is permanent.

586
00:51:07,675 --> 00:51:10,167
So, make as many mistakes
as you can.

587
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:13,414
That way, someday,
when they ask what we wanna be...

588
00:51:14,128 --> 00:51:19,105
we won't have to guess.
We'll know.

589
00:51:46,447 --> 00:00:00,000
You've made it!

590
00:51:48,274 --> 00:00:00,000
- Hey.
- What'd you think of my speech?

591
00:51:50,749 --> 00:51:53,327
Too easy-breezy, too self-helpful?
You may admit it.

592
00:51:53,757 --> 00:00:00,000
- No, you pretty much nailed it.
- Yeah?

593
00:51:56,614 --> 00:52:00,970
- It's like I was born to lead, right?
- Oh, great. I love this song, let's go.

594
00:52:25,648 --> 00:52:29,437
- What are you doing here?
- You invited me, remember?

595
00:52:30,166 --> 00:00:00,000
Was my right hook
too subtle for you?

596
00:52:32,744 --> 00:00:00,000
That was me
uninviting you.

597
00:52:34,966 --> 00:52:38,986
Look, Bella. I'm sorry...
about, you know...

598
00:52:40,030 --> 00:00:00,000
The kiss and your hand...

599
00:52:43,370 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd blame it on the whole
inner animal thing...

600
00:52:44,872 --> 00:52:49,618
But it was really just... me.
Being an ass.

601
00:52:50,457 --> 00:52:52,212
I'm really sorry.

602
00:52:53,567 --> 00:52:55,134
I brought you something.

603
00:52:55,653 --> 00:52:59,315
A graduation present.
I made it myself.

604
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:03,108
Oh...
You made this?

605
00:53:04,053 --> 00:53:07,230
It's really pretty.
Thanks.

606
00:53:21,881 --> 00:53:23,340
I'll be right back.

607
00:53:26,195 --> 00:00:00,000
- Alice, what did you see?
- The decision's been made.

608
00:53:29,355 --> 00:00:00,000
- What's going on?
- You're not going to Seattle?

609
00:53:32,726 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

610
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:36,438
They're coming here.

611
00:53:37,187 --> 00:53:40,718
- They'll be here in four days.
- This could turn into a blood bath.

612
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:44,068
- Who's behind it?
- I didn't see anyone I recognize.

613
00:53:45,222 --> 00:00:00,000
Maybe one...

614
00:53:47,331 --> 00:53:51,012
I know his face.
He's local, Riley Biers.

615
00:53:51,531 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't start this.

616
00:53:52,633 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoever did
is staying out of the action.

617
00:53:55,081 --> 00:00:00,000
They must be playing with
the blind spots in your vision.

618
00:53:57,438 --> 00:00:00,000
Either way,
the army is coming...

619
00:53:59,048 --> 00:00:00,000
and there aren't enough of us
to protect the town.

620
00:54:01,345 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold up!
What damn army?

621
00:54:04,061 --> 00:00:00,000
- Newborns. Our kind.
- What are they after?

622
00:54:07,627 --> 00:00:00,000
They were passing around
Bella's scent. A red blouse.

623
00:54:11,165 --> 00:00:00,000
They're after Bella?

624
00:54:13,291 --> 00:00:00,000
- What the hell does this mean?
- It means an ugly fight.

625
00:54:16,411 --> 00:54:18,633
With lives lost.

626
00:54:22,833 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright...

627
00:54:24,537 --> 00:00:00,000
- We're in.
- No.

628
00:54:27,041 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll get yourselves killed,
noway.

629
00:54:29,134 --> 00:54:33,654
- I wasn't asking for permission.
- Edward.

630
00:54:37,003 --> 00:54:39,289
It means
more protection for you.

631
00:54:39,904 --> 00:54:45,004
Jacob. Do you believe Sam
will agree to... an understanding?

632
00:54:46,320 --> 00:00:00,000
As long as we get to kill
some vampires.

633
00:54:49,080 --> 00:00:00,000
- Jasper?
- They'll give us the numbers.

634
00:54:53,475 --> 00:00:00,000
And the newborns won't know
they even exist.

635
00:54:56,118 --> 00:00:00,000
- That'll give us an edge.
- We'll need to coordinate.

636
00:54:58,834 --> 00:00:00,000
- Carlisle, they'll gonna get hurt.
- We'll all need some training.

637
00:55:02,904 --> 00:00:00,000
Fighting newborns requires
knowledge that Jasper has.

638
00:55:05,931 --> 00:55:07,785
You're welcome to join us.

639
00:55:09,328 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.
Name the time and place.

640
00:55:12,557 --> 00:00:00,000
Jake...

641
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:16,940
You don't know
what you're getting yourself in to.

642
00:55:17,878 --> 00:00:00,000
Bella...

643
00:55:19,855 --> 00:00:00,000
This is what we do.
You should be happy.

644
00:55:24,126 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at us, working together.

645
00:55:27,195 --> 00:55:30,506
You're the one who wanted us
to get along, remember?

646
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:41,831
Again!

647
00:55:54,699 --> 00:55:56,831
It's a graduation present.

648
00:56:16,027 --> 00:00:00,000
They don't trust us enough
to be in their human forms.

649
00:56:18,804 --> 00:56:21,312
They came.
That's what matters.

650
00:56:22,258 --> 00:56:24,182
Will you translate?

651
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:30,955
Hey, Jake.

652
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:38,266
Welcome.

653
00:56:40,108 --> 00:00:00,000
Jasper has experience
with newborns.

654
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,853
He'll teach us
how to defeat them.

655
00:56:47,304 --> 00:56:49,346
They want to know
how the "newborns" is differ from us.

656
00:56:50,472 --> 00:00:00,000
They're a great deal
stronger than us,

657
00:56:52,098 --> 00:56:55,062
because their own human blood
lingers in their tissues.

658
00:56:55,755 --> 00:00:00,000
Our kind is never more
physically powerful...

659
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:02,097
than in our first several months
of this life.

660
00:57:05,217 --> 00:00:00,000
Carlisle's right.

661
00:57:07,381 --> 00:57:09,739
That's why
they are created.

662
00:57:10,324 --> 00:57:14,221
A newborn army, doesn't need
thousands like a human army.

663
00:57:14,944 --> 00:57:17,321
And no human army
could stand against them.

664
00:57:19,191 --> 00:00:00,000
The two most important things
to remember are, first...

665
00:57:22,270 --> 00:00:00,000
Never let them
get their arms around you.

666
00:57:23,933 --> 00:57:27,069
They'll crush you instantly.
The second...

667
00:57:28,642 --> 00:57:31,458
Never go
for the obvious kill.

668
00:57:32,924 --> 00:57:38,024
They'll be expecting that.
And you will lose.

669
00:57:39,564 --> 00:57:41,277
Emmett?

670
00:57:47,981 --> 00:57:51,359
Don't hold back.
Not in my nature.

671
00:58:05,651 --> 00:58:07,210
Never lose focus.

672
00:58:28,317 --> 00:58:29,631
One more thing...

673
00:58:30,529 --> 00:58:33,140
Never turn your back
on your enemy.

674
00:59:20,269 --> 00:59:22,048
Some of you,
are gonna get hurt.

675
00:59:25,369 --> 00:59:29,169
Some of you
could get killed, because of me.

676
00:59:31,807 --> 00:59:34,264
It's gonna be a hundred times
worse than this, right?

677
00:59:57,358 --> 00:59:59,394
We're done for the day.

678
01:00:11,957 --> 01:00:13,983
Jasper...

679
01:00:16,475 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you sure, there's nothing
I can do to help?

680
01:00:19,408 --> 00:00:00,000
Your presence alone,
your scent will distract the newborns.

681
01:00:23,035 --> 01:00:27,443
Their hunting instinct will take over,
drive them crazy.

682
01:00:28,564 --> 01:00:30,697
Good. I'm glad.

683
01:00:32,788 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey.

684
01:00:34,374 --> 01:00:36,528
How do you know so much
about this?

685
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:42,507
I didn't have quite the same upbringing
as my adopted siblings.

686
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,068
Those bites are like mine.

687
01:00:50,911 --> 01:00:52,463
Battle scars.

688
01:00:54,013 --> 00:00:00,000
All the training the Confederate Army
gave me...

689
01:00:56,745 --> 01:00:59,042
was useless against
the newborns.

690
01:01:00,102 --> 01:01:04,049
Still,
I never lost a fight.

691
01:01:08,878 --> 00:00:00,000
This has happened
during the civil war?

692
01:01:11,850 --> 00:00:00,000
I was the youngest major
in the Texas cavalry.

693
01:01:14,701 --> 00:00:00,000
All without having seen
any real battle.

694
01:01:17,546 --> 01:01:18,761
Until...

695
01:01:20,554 --> 01:01:22,912
Until I'm not a certain immortal.

696
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:25,363
Maria.

697
01:01:29,762 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I was riding back
to Galveston... </i>

698
01:01:30,972 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>after evacuating
a column of women and children. </i>

699
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:35,881
When I saw her...

700
01:01:37,029 --> 01:01:39,183
I immediately offered her my aid.

701
01:01:46,859 --> 01:01:50,045
Lovely. And an officer.

702
01:01:57,009 --> 01:02:02,209
You'd better do it, Maria.
I can never stop once I've started.

703
01:02:05,008 --> 00:00:00,000
- What's your name, soldier?
- Major Jasper Whitlock, Ma'am.

704
01:02:09,791 --> 01:02:11,540
I hope you survive.

705
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:16,019
You maybe of
a great use to me.

706
01:02:20,883 --> 00:00:00,000
Maria was creating an army?

707
01:02:22,911 --> 00:00:00,000
They were very common
in the South.

708
01:02:25,050 --> 00:00:00,000
And cost a brutal battles
for territory.

709
01:02:28,758 --> 01:02:30,792
Maria won them all.

710
01:02:31,646 --> 01:02:36,646
She was smart, careful.
And she had me.

711
01:02:39,093 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I was the second in command. </i>

712
01:02:41,938 --> 01:02:45,783
<i>My abilities to control emotions
served her well. </i>

713
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:48,691
<i>I trained her newborns. </i>

714
01:02:51,747 --> 01:02:56,161
<i>An endless occupation since she never
let them live beyond their first year. </i>

715
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,580
<i>It was my job
to dispose of them. </i>

716
01:03:22,156 --> 01:03:25,031
<i>I could feel
everything they felt. </i>

717
01:03:37,617 --> 01:03:40,339
I thought what Maria and I had
was love.

718
01:03:41,727 --> 01:03:46,427
But I was her puppet.
She pulled the strings.

719
01:03:47,594 --> 01:03:50,052
I didn't know
there was another way...

720
01:03:51,938 --> 01:03:53,976
Until I found Alice.

721
01:03:55,476 --> 00:00:00,000
Now she'd seen me coming,
of course.

722
01:03:58,486 --> 01:04:00,870
Kept me waiting long enough.

723
01:04:04,428 --> 01:04:06,401
My apologies, Ma'am.

724
01:04:08,057 --> 01:04:10,144
I don't know what I'd have become
without her.

725
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:15,398
You'll never have to be
that again.

726
01:05:04,413 --> 01:05:05,490
What is it?

727
01:05:09,168 --> 00:00:00,000
The intruder...

728
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:14,565
The newborn army.

729
01:05:16,188 --> 01:05:18,669
They're all her puppets.

730
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:22,081
Victoria.

731
01:05:23,171 --> 00:00:00,000
Alice would've seen
if she wanted to make an army.

732
01:05:26,457 --> 00:00:00,000
Unless she's hiding
behind them,

733
01:05:29,633 --> 01:05:31,917
and she's letting
someone else decide.

734
01:06:00,475 --> 01:06:02,726
Welcome to the army.

735
01:06:11,902 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not just gonna hide,

736
01:06:12,759 --> 01:06:14,759
while you're taking
all the risks for me?

737
01:06:16,414 --> 00:00:00,000
If it's Victoria involved...

738
01:06:17,275 --> 00:00:00,000
I need to keep you as far away
from the fight as possible.

739
01:06:19,824 --> 00:00:00,000
Jasper said that
I could be of help.

740
01:06:22,124 --> 00:00:00,000
We won't need your help.

741
01:06:23,483 --> 00:00:00,000
With the wolves in this,
it's an easy win.

742
01:06:26,275 --> 01:06:28,441
The rest of us,
aren't gonna have enough to do.

743
01:06:29,064 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, either it's so dangerous
that I have to hide...

744
01:06:31,291 --> 00:00:00,000
Or it's so easy, that you're gonna be
side blind, which is it?

745
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:36,097
It's dangerous for you.
It's easy for us.

746
01:06:37,936 --> 01:06:40,205
I think it's dangerous
for us to be apart.

747
01:06:41,035 --> 01:06:43,028
How many times
we have to prove that?

748
01:06:43,703 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be worrying.
You'll be worried.

749
01:06:47,153 --> 01:06:49,427
And we''ll both
feel more horrible.

750
01:06:51,206 --> 01:06:52,292
Okay, you're right.

751
01:06:53,696 --> 00:00:00,000
So, I'm coming with you.

752
01:06:55,067 --> 01:06:57,011
No, we've got
to stay away together.

753
01:06:57,784 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't make you choose
between me and your family, it's...

754
01:07:00,691 --> 01:07:03,344
The only way I can protect you,
is to be with you.

755
01:07:07,881 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not fighting?

756
01:07:09,722 --> 00:00:00,000
What, you pull a muscle
or something?

757
01:07:11,877 --> 01:07:14,838
- He's doing it for me. Okay?
- Whatever.

758
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:17,053
Just tell me the plan.

759
01:07:17,795 --> 00:00:00,000
This field will give us
an advantage in battle.

760
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:22,600
We need to lure the newborns
with Bella's scent.

761
01:07:23,460 --> 00:00:00,000
It needs to end here.

762
01:07:25,163 --> 00:00:00,000
Edward and I
are going on a campsite.

763
01:07:26,829 --> 01:07:29,780
Even if he carries me,
they'll still pick up our scents.

764
01:07:30,211 --> 00:00:00,000
Your stench, however,
is revolting.

765
01:07:32,333 --> 00:00:00,000
Dude, you really don't want
to start comparing stinks.

766
01:07:34,507 --> 00:00:00,000
What he means, is that your scent
will mask mine if you carry me.

767
01:07:39,058 --> 00:00:00,000
Done.

768
01:07:40,532 --> 00:00:00,000
This is not a good idea.

769
01:07:42,095 --> 00:00:00,000
Edward.

770
01:07:43,273 --> 00:00:00,000
They won't want to get
anywhere near his... odor.

771
01:07:47,479 --> 01:07:49,243
Okay, let's just try it.

772
01:07:52,243 --> 01:07:55,113
- Eau de wolf, comin' up.
- Run.

773
01:08:04,795 --> 00:00:00,000
You gonna ask me
to sit out the fight, too?

774
01:08:07,667 --> 00:00:00,000
Or don't you care
about my safety?

775
01:08:10,104 --> 01:08:13,445
Of course I care,
but you'd say no.

776
01:08:14,038 --> 01:08:15,802
So I won't have a choice
anyways.

777
01:08:16,736 --> 00:00:00,000
Since I let Sam be alpha male.

778
01:08:19,447 --> 01:08:21,656
I got to live with the shots
he calls.

779
01:08:22,254 --> 01:08:24,469
Since you let Sam be alpha?

780
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:29,570
I didn't want to be in a pack,
let alone be it's their leader.

781
01:08:31,226 --> 01:08:32,666
Wow.

782
01:08:33,750 --> 00:00:00,000
- Chief Jacob.
- Opted out.

783
01:08:37,740 --> 00:00:00,000
But every choice has
it's consequences.

784
01:08:40,699 --> 00:00:00,000
- Some more than others.
- Don't start.

785
01:08:43,723 --> 00:00:00,000
Everybody makes choices,
you gonna have to accept mine.

786
01:08:46,658 --> 01:08:49,357
You can love more than
one person at a time.

787
01:08:50,203 --> 01:08:53,960
I've seen it,
with Sam, Emily, and Leah.

788
01:08:55,359 --> 00:00:00,000
Well...

789
01:08:56,443 --> 01:09:00,722
- I'm not a wolf, I can't imprint.
- It has nothing to do with imprinting.

790
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:05,179
It has to do with...
Feeling something for somebody.

791
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:08,556
And I know
you feel something for me.

792
01:09:09,569 --> 00:00:00,000
I can sense
how I make you feel...

793
01:09:11,834 --> 01:09:13,460
Physically.

794
01:09:14,598 --> 01:09:16,429
I make you nervous.

795
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:22,197
Jake.

796
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,248
Don't worry.

797
01:09:26,356 --> 01:09:28,975
I promised I wouldn't kiss you
again until you asked.

798
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:33,280
You're going to be keeping
that promise for a while, Chief.

799
01:09:36,979 --> 01:09:41,065
All I picked up was wolf stench.
No Bella.

800
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:46,968
- This will work.
- Great.

801
01:09:56,651 --> 01:09:58,903
- Okay, Alice. Don't be a stranger.
- Okay.

802
01:10:01,238 --> 00:00:00,000
Your alibi for the battle
is all arranged.

803
01:10:03,378 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

804
01:10:04,672 --> 00:00:00,000
I told your father that our whole
family's going camping this weekend.

805
01:10:07,367 --> 01:10:10,313
So you and I are having
a sleep over at my house.

806
01:10:11,129 --> 01:10:13,690
- Charlie is going fishing anyway.
- Charlie?

807
01:10:14,670 --> 00:00:00,000
You guys run
for the same basis now?

808
01:10:16,837 --> 01:10:18,677
Me, he likes.

809
01:10:19,663 --> 01:10:22,664
Actually, you and Edward will have
the house to yourself tonight.

810
01:10:26,406 --> 00:00:00,000
Like alone?

811
01:10:28,216 --> 01:10:31,778
We're all going hunting,
powering up for the battle.

812
01:10:34,372 --> 01:10:36,005
You're welcome.

813
01:10:37,725 --> 01:10:41,999
- Hey. Do you want a sandwich?
- No, I'm good.

814
01:10:43,508 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, the sister...
I like.

815
01:10:46,597 --> 01:10:50,145
Alice.
Yeah, she's great.

816
01:10:57,395 --> 01:10:59,799
Hey, Dad.
I was wondering...

817
01:11:00,932 --> 01:11:04,447
Why didn't you get remarried,
after Mom?

818
01:11:08,516 --> 01:11:09,867
I don't know...

819
01:11:11,356 --> 01:11:13,785
Guess I still haven't met
the right gal.

820
01:11:15,713 --> 01:11:18,335
- Why?
- I don't know.

821
01:11:21,149 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought you just...

822
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,227
Maybe you gave up
on the whole institution of it.

823
01:11:26,227 --> 01:11:27,889
Of marriage.

824
01:11:29,301 --> 01:11:31,460
But do you think
there's any value in it?

825
01:11:33,337 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

826
01:11:35,318 --> 01:11:36,874
Yeah, marriage has value.

827
01:11:38,513 --> 01:11:42,713
When you're older.
Much older.

828
01:11:44,678 --> 00:00:00,000
Like you're mother...

829
01:11:46,530 --> 00:00:00,000
It seem to work out fine for her
the second time round.

830
01:11:48,921 --> 01:11:52,283
- Later in life.
- Yeah, I guess.

831
01:11:54,350 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean...

832
01:11:55,615 --> 00:00:00,000
You definitely don't wanna
have to get married,

833
01:11:57,391 --> 01:12:00,963
because you weren't...
careful.

834
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:04,506
What?

835
01:12:05,082 --> 00:00:00,000
Look, you know
what I'm talking about.

836
01:12:06,295 --> 00:00:00,000
There's...

837
01:12:08,053 --> 00:00:00,000
Things, that you need
to think about it, if you...

838
01:12:09,690 --> 00:00:00,000
If you gonna be...
physically intimate.

839
01:12:11,302 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. Don't...
until we've enough of "The Talk".

840
01:12:13,855 --> 00:00:00,000
- Don't you just quit.
- It's just as embarrassing for me,

841
01:12:15,815 --> 00:00:00,000
- as it is for you.
- I doubt that.

842
01:12:17,998 --> 00:00:00,000
And don't bother, 'cause Mom
beat you too early ten years ago.

843
01:12:20,513 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, you didn't have a boyfriend
ten years ago.

844
01:12:22,473 --> 01:12:25,607
I'm sure things work
the same way.

845
01:12:27,408 --> 01:12:29,544
Alright.
So...

846
01:12:30,808 --> 00:00:00,000
You guys are...
taking precautions, and...

847
01:12:33,327 --> 01:12:36,946
Okay, dad. Please just
don't worry about that.

848
01:12:37,424 --> 01:12:41,083
Edward is... old school.

849
01:12:42,850 --> 00:00:00,000
Old school, great.

850
01:12:44,953 --> 00:00:00,000
What's that?
Like a code for something?

851
01:12:46,438 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh my god.
Dad...

852
01:12:48,311 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm a virgin!

853
01:12:50,097 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, go.
Glad we covered that.

854
01:12:52,789 --> 01:12:54,537
Me too.

855
01:12:58,147 --> 01:12:59,803
Virgin...

856
01:13:01,139 --> 01:13:03,505
Liking Edward
a little bit more now.

857
01:13:14,391 --> 01:13:16,695
What are you doing here outside?
What's wrong?

858
01:13:17,831 --> 01:13:19,366
Nothing.

859
01:13:38,891 --> 01:13:41,431
It seems the only fair,
that I'd be represented as well.

860
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:48,263
It's really pretty.

861
01:13:49,466 --> 01:13:50,957
Thanks.

862
01:13:58,721 --> 01:14:00,080
There's a bed.

863
01:14:01,615 --> 01:14:03,468
I thought you might need one
to sleep in.

864
01:14:06,639 --> 01:14:08,805
I think an air mattress
would've sufficed.

865
01:14:09,282 --> 01:14:12,580
- It is too much?
- No.

866
01:14:13,408 --> 01:14:14,936
No, it's perfect.

867
01:14:16,637 --> 01:14:18,441
I want to ask you something.

868
01:14:19,437 --> 01:14:20,912
Anything.

869
01:14:24,276 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, marriage
is the condition for you,

870
01:14:26,539 --> 01:14:28,524
to change me yourself, right?

871
01:14:30,529 --> 01:14:32,278
Yes.

872
01:14:34,555 --> 01:14:38,146
Okay. I want to negotiate my
own condition.

873
01:14:39,774 --> 01:14:42,485
Anything you want,
It's yours.

874
01:14:43,981 --> 01:14:45,693
Do you promise?

875
01:14:47,132 --> 01:14:48,620
Yeah.

876
01:15:09,979 --> 01:15:11,419
Bella... no.

877
01:15:14,053 --> 00:00:00,000
You've said that you wanted me
to have every human experience.

878
01:15:16,187 --> 00:00:00,000
Not the ones
that support risk killing you.

879
01:15:18,545 --> 01:15:20,134
You won't.

880
01:15:21,493 --> 00:00:00,000
And everyone says,
once I'm changed...

881
01:15:22,835 --> 01:15:25,276
all I'm gonna want is
to slaughter the whole town.

882
01:15:25,759 --> 01:15:27,996
That part doesn't last forever.

883
01:15:28,363 --> 01:15:30,004
I want you.

884
01:15:31,296 --> 01:15:36,336
While I'm still me.
While I still want you this way.

885
01:15:40,318 --> 01:15:42,183
It's too dangerous.

886
01:15:42,862 --> 01:15:46,617
Try...
Just try.

887
01:15:48,230 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll go to some ridiculously
expensive college

888
01:15:50,058 --> 01:15:51,837
and let you buy me a car.

889
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:55,355
I'll marry you, just try.

890
01:16:36,137 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop trying to take
your clothes off.

891
01:16:38,782 --> 01:16:41,345
- Do you want to do that part?
- Not tonight.

892
01:17:05,672 --> 01:17:08,555
Okay.
I mean, you don't...

893
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,355
But, fine.

894
01:17:15,041 --> 01:17:17,873
Believe me, I want to.

895
01:17:19,591 --> 01:17:21,935
I just want to be married
to you first.

896
01:17:24,524 --> 00:00:00,000
You really make me feel like
I'm some sort of like a villain trying...

897
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:30,578
steal your virtue
or something.

898
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:35,000
It's not my virtue
I'm concerned about.

899
01:17:36,989 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you kidding?

900
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:43,820
It's just one rule,
I wanna leave unbroken.

901
01:17:45,548 --> 01:17:49,067
It might be too late for my soul,
but I will protect yours.

902
01:17:50,457 --> 00:00:00,000
- I know it's not a modern notion.
- It's not modern.

903
01:17:55,136 --> 01:17:57,232
It's ancient.

904
01:17:59,346 --> 01:18:01,381
I'm from a different era.

905
01:18:03,777 --> 01:18:08,168
Things were...
a lot less complicated.

906
01:18:09,721 --> 01:18:14,721
And if I met you back then,
I would've courted to you.

907
01:18:16,397 --> 00:00:00,000
We'd have taken
chaperoned strolls,

908
01:18:18,682 --> 01:18:22,040
or had iced tea
on the porch.

909
01:18:32,473 --> 01:18:34,817
I may have stolen
a kiss or two.

910
01:18:35,709 --> 00:00:00,000
But, only...

911
01:18:38,904 --> 01:18:41,500
after asking
your father's permission.

912
01:18:43,116 --> 01:18:45,164
I would've got down
on one knee.

913
01:18:51,655 --> 01:18:53,962
And I would
presented you with a ring.

914
01:19:01,678 --> 01:19:03,152
This was my mother's.

915
01:19:07,032 --> 01:19:11,832
Isabella Swan. I promise
to love you, every moment forever.

916
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:16,897
And would you do me the extraordinary
honor of marrying me?

917
01:19:22,692 --> 01:19:23,692
Yes.

918
01:19:45,903 --> 01:19:47,861
You're not coming with us?

919
01:19:56,410 --> 01:19:59,141
It will be a last minute decision.

920
01:20:00,870 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you how it works.

921
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:06,936
The Cullens have powers.

922
01:20:07,531 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't underestimate them,
Riley.

923
01:20:10,593 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll have the numbers,

924
01:20:12,967 --> 00:00:00,000
but they'll be able to...

925
01:20:15,178 --> 01:20:19,084
anticipate your every move.

926
01:20:19,680 --> 00:00:00,000
- According to your friend.
- Yes.

927
01:20:22,970 --> 01:20:26,538
My dead friend.

928
01:20:28,697 --> 01:20:31,988
Laurent found out about
the things they could do,

929
01:20:33,987 --> 01:20:35,836
and they killed him.

930
01:20:37,619 --> 01:20:40,818
But not before he told me.

931
01:20:45,054 --> 01:20:46,916
Maybe he was wrong.

932
01:20:49,858 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean...

933
01:20:51,712 --> 00:00:00,000
This is supposed to be...

934
01:20:54,296 --> 00:00:00,000
Cullen territory.

935
01:20:57,331 --> 01:21:01,730
But we've been tearing it up
and I've never even seen them here.

936
01:21:02,417 --> 01:21:04,593
You don't trust me.

937
01:21:05,445 --> 00:00:00,000
With my life.
I'm just saying that...

938
01:21:07,906 --> 01:21:11,644
I'm doing this for us.
So that we can feed,

939
01:21:12,067 --> 00:00:00,000
without their retaliation.
I can't live in fear anymore,

940
01:21:17,167 --> 00:00:00,000
waiting for them to attack.

941
01:21:18,822 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't let them.

942
01:21:21,847 --> 01:21:26,847
I'm going to
end the Cullen clan.

943
01:21:29,346 --> 01:21:31,218
I swear.

944
01:21:48,088 --> 01:21:52,081
I love you. So much.

945
01:22:12,059 --> 01:22:13,442
You're going overboard.

946
01:22:14,130 --> 00:00:00,000
If this is all I can contribute,
I want to be thorough.

947
01:22:16,743 --> 01:22:18,794
The newborns will be frantic.

948
01:22:21,203 --> 01:22:24,084
It's Okay. Don't make yourself
uncomfortable.

949
01:22:24,685 --> 01:22:26,572
It doesn't bother me anymore.

950
01:22:28,202 --> 00:00:00,000
Since when?

951
01:22:29,709 --> 01:22:32,472
Since I spent 24 hours
thinking you were dead.

952
01:22:34,347 --> 01:22:35,959
You're not wearing your ring.

953
01:22:38,221 --> 01:22:40,161
Well, I didn't want to risk
losing it.

954
01:22:42,478 --> 01:22:44,479
Or risk Jacob seeing it?

955
01:22:47,176 --> 00:00:00,000
I think we should wait to tell him.
I mean, at least till after the fight.

956
01:22:50,896 --> 01:22:53,551
- If you're having second thoughts...
- I'm not.

957
01:22:53,777 --> 00:00:00,000
I just want him to have
a clear head.

958
01:22:56,537 --> 01:22:58,124
Whose head is unclear?

959
01:22:59,462 --> 01:23:01,115
Nobody's, I hope.

960
01:23:02,183 --> 00:00:00,000
Alice says
there's a storm coming.

961
01:23:04,155 --> 01:23:07,872
Yeah, I can feel it.
We should get going.

962
01:23:09,197 --> 01:23:10,878
I'll see you
in a couple of hours.

963
01:23:20,983 --> 01:23:22,468
Something up?

964
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:27,074
A bunch of vampires
trying to kill me.

965
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:29,870
Same old, same old.

966
01:24:47,231 --> 01:24:48,551
Thank you.

967
01:24:50,949 --> 00:00:00,000
You should get back
before the storm hits.

968
01:24:52,878 --> 00:00:00,000
No, I'm staying.

969
01:24:54,697 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll need my connection
to the pack,

970
01:24:55,870 --> 00:00:00,000
to keep tabs
on what's going on.

971
01:24:57,469 --> 01:25:00,179
- You're not going to fight?
- Seth will spell me in the morning.

972
01:25:01,335 --> 00:00:00,000
He's not happy
about missing the action,

973
01:25:03,195 --> 01:25:05,005
but it'll keep him
out of trouble.

974
01:25:06,111 --> 01:25:07,857
Let's get you inside.

975
01:25:25,882 --> 00:00:00,000
I should have chosen
a site lower down.

976
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:30,632
No, It's fine. I'm okay.

977
01:25:31,655 --> 01:25:32,897
What can I do?

978
01:25:45,934 --> 01:25:49,023
I can't sleep with all that
teeth chattering going on.

979
01:25:56,547 --> 01:25:57,709
Forget it.

980
01:25:58,991 --> 00:00:00,000
She may need her toes someday.
And let's face it...

981
01:26:04,091 --> 01:26:06,480
I'm hotter than you.

982
01:26:10,426 --> 00:00:00,000
Get your hand off me!

983
01:26:13,756 --> 00:00:00,000
Get your hands off her!

984
01:26:16,053 --> 01:26:17,788
Don't fight.

985
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:23,047
She gets sick, it's on you.

986
01:26:39,466 --> 01:26:41,210
Why!
you're freezing, Bella

987
01:26:42,845 --> 01:26:46,472
Relax,
You'll warm up soon.

988
01:26:47,802 --> 01:26:49,868
Faster
if you took your clothes off.

989
01:26:50,659 --> 01:26:54,044
- Jake.
- Survival one oh one.

990
01:27:24,805 --> 01:27:28,222
Can you, at least attempt
to control your thoughts?

991
01:27:30,485 --> 01:27:33,850
I really get under that
ice cold skin of yours, don't I?

992
01:27:36,478 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

993
01:27:38,642 --> 01:27:40,930
Are you doubting her feelings
for you?

994
01:27:43,902 --> 00:00:00,000
Nice...

995
01:27:45,899 --> 00:00:00,000
So picking through
my brain's okay,

996
01:27:48,767 --> 01:27:51,947
but letting me into yours,
forget it.

997
01:27:55,545 --> 01:27:56,628
Look...

998
01:27:58,309 --> 01:28:01,194
- I know she's in love with you.
- Oh, good.

999
01:28:01,694 --> 01:28:03,989
But she's in love with me, too.

1000
01:28:06,309 --> 01:28:08,596
She just won't admit it to herself.

1001
01:28:11,848 --> 01:28:13,661
I can't tell you
if you're right.

1002
01:28:15,743 --> 00:00:00,000
Then let me ask you something.

1003
01:28:18,406 --> 01:28:21,352
- If she chooses me...
- She won't.

1004
01:28:21,682 --> 01:28:23,334
If she did.

1005
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:26,784
Would you try to kill me?

1006
01:28:27,753 --> 01:28:29,847
That's an intriguing idea.

1007
01:28:34,743 --> 01:28:38,448
But no.
I couldn't hurt her like that.

1008
01:28:38,967 --> 00:00:00,000
see, you'd just turn her into
a bloodsucking demon like you.

1009
01:28:42,568 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want that.
I never wanted that.

1010
01:28:46,086 --> 01:28:48,538
- So stop her.
- I tried.

1011
01:28:50,178 --> 01:28:53,134
- I left.
- But you gave up too quickly.

1012
01:28:55,063 --> 00:00:00,000
If you'd stayed away
another six months,

1013
01:28:58,651 --> 01:29:01,939
I could've made her happy.
Trust me.

1014
01:29:03,392 --> 00:00:00,000
You have to consider...

1015
01:29:06,014 --> 01:29:08,885
that I might be better for her
than you are.

1016
01:29:10,763 --> 01:29:13,006
I have considered that.

1017
01:29:16,659 --> 01:29:18,432
I know you can protect her.

1018
01:29:21,323 --> 00:00:00,000
But you can give her a life,
a human life.

1019
01:29:24,865 --> 01:29:26,834
It's all I want for her.

1020
01:29:29,470 --> 00:00:00,000
But, I'm not...

1021
01:29:31,282 --> 01:29:35,358
I'm not going to force her
into anything, ever again.

1022
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:40,306
The last time I tried,
it almost killed us both.

1023
01:29:42,939 --> 01:29:45,449
Yeah, that I remember.

1024
01:29:49,579 --> 01:29:51,694
When you thought
she was gone...

1025
01:29:54,184 --> 01:29:56,386
that you'd lost her...

1026
01:29:58,426 --> 01:30:01,948
How did you... cope?

1027
01:30:03,484 --> 01:30:05,424
There're no words.

1028
01:30:11,238 --> 01:30:13,797
But I wouldn't wash it
on anyone, Jacob.

1029
01:30:16,333 --> 00:00:00,000
This might sound odd,
but I'm glad you're here.

1030
01:30:20,567 --> 01:30:21,781
Pretty neat.

1031
01:30:23,633 --> 01:30:26,941
As much as I'd love to kill you,
I'm glad she's warm.

1032
01:30:29,892 --> 00:00:00,000
If we weren't
natural enemies...

1033
01:30:32,547 --> 00:00:00,000
and you weren't trying to steal
my reason for existing...

1034
01:30:36,848 --> 01:30:39,225
I might actually like you.

1035
01:30:40,026 --> 01:30:41,504
Well...

1036
01:30:42,830 --> 01:30:46,657
If you weren't planning on sucking
the life out of the girl I love,

1037
01:30:47,969 --> 01:30:49,706
I might...

1038
01:30:56,459 --> 01:31:00,069
No...
Not even then.

1039
01:31:07,791 --> 01:31:11,489
But she could still
change her mind, you know.

1040
01:31:17,896 --> 01:31:19,794
Then I'd let her go.

1041
01:31:39,277 --> 01:31:40,768
Fine. Hi, Seth.

1042
01:31:44,257 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Jacob?
Did he already...

1043
01:31:46,006 --> 01:31:47,276
Not yet.

1044
01:31:48,926 --> 01:31:51,551
He's checking to see if the woods
are clear before he goes.

1045
01:31:59,635 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm really sorry
about last night.

1046
01:32:02,065 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't have been
easy on you.

1047
01:32:03,698 --> 01:32:06,818
It definitely won't make my list
of top ten favorite evenings.

1048
01:32:07,737 --> 01:32:09,376
You have a list?

1049
01:32:10,224 --> 01:32:12,063
All ten I spent with you.

1050
01:32:13,185 --> 01:32:15,421
Number one is when you said
you'd marry me.

1051
01:32:16,833 --> 01:32:18,637
Mrs. Cullen.

1052
01:32:21,540 --> 00:00:00,000
This is the twenty-first century,

1053
01:32:23,541 --> 01:32:25,541
I always wanna
hyphenate my name.

1054
01:32:26,211 --> 01:32:28,111
You're marrying him?

1055
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:30,067
Jake...

1056
01:32:34,034 --> 01:32:35,723
You knew he was listening?

1057
01:32:36,564 --> 01:32:38,414
He deserves to know.

1058
01:32:38,958 --> 00:00:00,000
- Jake, stop!
- Bella, let him...

1059
01:32:40,413 --> 01:32:41,133
Don't!

1060
01:32:44,797 --> 01:32:46,500
Jake, stop!

1061
01:32:49,661 --> 01:32:53,915
- Jake, please!
- I'm done! I'm so done!

1062
01:32:54,484 --> 00:00:00,000
- What can I do?
- You can't do anything.

1063
01:32:57,093 --> 00:00:00,000
I can. By going out there
and killing something.

1064
01:32:59,827 --> 00:00:00,000
No! You're not thinking clearly,
don't do that!

1065
01:33:03,093 --> 00:00:00,000
Maybe I'll get my self killed
and make it simple for you.

1066
01:33:05,346 --> 01:33:08,941
No! Just, Jake...
Stay!

1067
01:33:09,765 --> 01:33:11,356
Why?

1068
01:33:12,841 --> 01:33:15,086
Give me one good reason.

1069
01:33:15,803 --> 01:33:17,785
Because I don't wanna lose you.

1070
01:33:19,304 --> 01:33:21,077
It's not good enough.

1071
01:33:21,947 --> 01:33:24,144
Because you're too important.

1072
01:33:27,392 --> 01:33:29,229
Still not good enough.

1073
01:33:30,164 --> 01:33:31,739
Jacob!

1074
01:33:35,047 --> 01:33:36,689
Kiss me!

1075
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:43,984
I'm asking you to kiss me.

1076
01:34:30,813 --> 01:34:33,219
That should have been
our first kiss.

1077
01:34:39,166 --> 01:34:41,066
I gotta go.

1078
01:34:43,469 --> 01:34:45,483
I'll be back.

1079
01:35:15,031 --> 01:35:16,669
You saw.

1080
01:35:17,817 --> 01:35:21,842
No. But Jacob's thoughts
are very loud.

1081
01:35:22,828 --> 01:35:24,398
I don't know what happened.

1082
01:35:26,358 --> 01:35:27,784
You love him.

1083
01:35:32,291 --> 01:35:33,921
I love you more.

1084
01:35:35,748 --> 01:35:37,733
I know.

1085
01:35:51,715 --> 01:35:53,376
It's starting.

1086
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,335
Jacob just got there.

1087
01:37:01,091 --> 01:37:02,760
He's good.

1088
01:38:01,394 --> 01:38:02,865
Someone's hurt?

1089
01:38:03,813 --> 00:00:00,000
She's close.
I can hear her thoughts.

1090
01:38:07,182 --> 01:38:09,049
Seth, go.

1091
01:38:13,515 --> 00:00:00,000
She knew we weren't there,
but she caught my scent.

1092
01:38:16,144 --> 01:38:17,959
She knew you'd be with me.

1093
01:38:18,999 --> 01:38:20,699
She found us.

1094
01:38:24,092 --> 01:38:25,991
She's not alone.

1095
01:38:34,899 --> 01:38:38,174
Riley...
Listen to me.

1096
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:42,212
Victoria's just using you,
to distract me.

1097
01:38:42,810 --> 01:38:44,614
But she knows I'll kill you.

1098
01:38:48,001 --> 01:38:51,479
In fact, she'll be glad she doesn't
have to deal with you anymore.

1099
01:38:52,375 --> 01:38:54,368
Don't listen, Riley.

1100
01:38:54,670 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you
about their mind tricks.

1101
01:38:56,855 --> 00:00:00,000
I can read her mind,
so I know what she thinks of you.

1102
01:39:01,179 --> 00:00:00,000
He's lying.

1103
01:39:02,917 --> 01:39:08,017
She only created you and this army
to avenge her true mate, James.

1104
01:39:08,819 --> 01:39:12,727
It's the only thing
she cares about. Not you.

1105
01:39:14,486 --> 01:39:18,666
There's only you.
You know that.

1106
01:39:20,455 --> 00:00:00,000
Think about it.

1107
01:39:22,872 --> 01:39:27,672
You're from Forks,
you know the area.

1108
01:39:28,238 --> 01:39:30,565
That's the only reason
she chose you.

1109
01:39:31,703 --> 01:39:33,529
She doesn't love you.

1110
01:39:34,079 --> 00:00:00,000
Riley...

1111
01:39:36,298 --> 01:39:39,818
Don't let him do this to us.

1112
01:39:41,451 --> 01:39:43,973
You know I love you.

1113
01:39:57,122 --> 01:39:58,931
You're dead.

1114
01:40:13,277 --> 01:40:15,549
You won't get another chance
like this again.

1115
01:40:19,951 --> 01:40:21,323
You want her!

1116
01:40:23,154 --> 01:40:26,727
You want me to feel the pain
you felt when I killed James.

1117
01:40:28,538 --> 01:40:31,602
When I tore him to pieces.

1118
01:40:33,686 --> 01:40:37,160
When I turned him into ash.

1119
01:40:38,606 --> 01:40:43,423
When I turned him
into nothing.

1120
01:42:02,669 --> 00:00:00,000
Victoria!

1121
01:42:04,999 --> 01:42:06,079
Victoria!

1122
01:43:03,223 --> 00:00:00,000
- Something's wrong.
- Alice needs us to go.

1123
01:43:07,041 --> 01:43:08,467
And now.

1124
01:43:31,082 --> 00:00:00,000
- How long?
- A few minutes. Maybe ten.

1125
01:43:34,126 --> 00:00:00,000
The pack needs to leave.

1126
01:43:35,508 --> 01:43:38,176
The Volturi won't honor a truce
with the werewolves.

1127
01:43:45,275 --> 01:43:46,725
Leah, don't!

1128
01:44:03,599 --> 01:44:05,176
Jacob!

1129
01:44:08,321 --> 00:00:00,000
Jacob. Hold on, Carlisle
is gonna take care of you.

1130
01:44:11,092 --> 01:44:13,496
The bones on the right half
of his body are shattered.

1131
01:44:15,090 --> 01:44:17,520
- Bella.
- Jake, I'm right here.

1132
01:44:19,304 --> 00:00:00,000
- Jacob, you idiot. I had it.
- Leah.

1133
01:44:21,773 --> 00:00:00,000
I need to set the bones before
his accelerated healing kicks in.

1134
01:44:24,596 --> 00:00:00,000
- It's already starting.
- We need to get him out of here.

1135
01:44:26,857 --> 01:44:29,019
We're not gonna win a fight
with the Volturi.

1136
01:44:29,923 --> 01:44:32,796
- We'll take him back to Billy's.
- I'll be there as soon as I can.

1137
01:44:33,266 --> 01:44:34,696
Hang in there, Jake.

1138
01:44:46,462 --> 01:44:47,875
We got you.

1139
01:44:48,762 --> 01:44:50,318
They're coming.

1140
01:45:11,256 --> 00:00:00,000
Impressive.

1141
01:45:12,664 --> 01:45:16,256
I've never seen a coven escape
an assault of this magnitude intact.

1142
01:45:17,256 --> 01:45:18,842
We were lucky.

1143
01:45:20,208 --> 01:45:21,896
I doubt that.

1144
01:45:23,854 --> 00:00:00,000
It appears we missed
an entertaining fight.

1145
01:45:26,668 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes. It's not often
we're rendered unnecessary.

1146
01:45:30,497 --> 01:45:33,546
If you'd arrived a half hour ago,
you would've fulfilled your purpose.

1147
01:45:35,099 --> 01:45:36,938
Pity.

1148
01:45:40,050 --> 01:45:41,849
You missed one.

1149
01:45:48,552 --> 01:45:51,386
We offered her asylum
in exchange for her surrender.

1150
01:45:52,255 --> 01:45:54,151
That wasn't yours to offer.

1151
01:45:57,362 --> 01:45:58,751
Why did you come?

1152
01:46:04,713 --> 01:46:06,160
Who created you?

1153
01:46:07,682 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't need to do that.

1154
01:46:08,814 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll tell you
anything you want to know.

1155
01:46:11,182 --> 01:46:12,589
I know.

1156
01:46:14,760 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know

1157
01:46:17,153 --> 00:00:00,000
Riley wouldn't tell us.

1158
01:46:19,233 --> 00:00:00,000
He said our thoughts
weren't safe.

1159
01:46:21,530 --> 01:46:25,123
Her name was Victoria.
Perhaps you knew her.

1160
01:46:25,756 --> 00:00:00,000
Edward. If the Volturi had
knowledge of Victoria,

1161
01:46:29,269 --> 01:46:30,795
they would've stopped her.

1162
01:46:31,766 --> 01:46:33,533
Isn't that right, Jane?

1163
01:46:35,447 --> 01:46:37,139
Of course.

1164
01:46:38,492 --> 01:46:39,977
Felix.

1165
01:46:40,764 --> 01:46:42,731
She didn't know
what she was doing.

1166
01:46:44,171 --> 01:46:46,666
We'll take responsibility for her.

1167
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:49,146
Give her a chance.

1168
01:46:51,476 --> 01:46:54,337
The Volturi don't give
second chances.

1169
01:46:55,752 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep that in mind.

1170
01:46:57,947 --> 01:47:00,744
Caius will be interested to know
that she's still human.

1171
01:47:01,281 --> 01:47:02,921
The date is set.

1172
01:47:06,298 --> 01:47:08,185
Take care of that, Felix.

1173
01:47:09,173 --> 01:47:10,947
I'd like to go home.

1174
01:47:45,357 --> 00:00:00,000
- It's been going on for a while.
- Doc's rebreaking his bones.

1175
01:47:49,012 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd he have to butt in?
I could've taken that tick...

1176
01:47:50,939 --> 01:47:52,908
Oh, give it a rest, Leah.

1177
01:47:59,109 --> 01:48:01,256
The worst is over.
He'll be alright.

1178
01:48:02,033 --> 00:00:00,000
I gave him some morphine,

1179
01:48:03,104 --> 00:00:00,000
but his body temperature
will burn it off soon.

1180
01:48:05,474 --> 01:48:07,408
I'll come back
to set up a drip.

1181
01:48:08,312 --> 01:48:09,806
Thank you.

1182
01:48:19,511 --> 01:48:21,419
He's asking for you.

1183
01:48:35,784 --> 01:48:37,597
Hey, Jake.

1184
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:41,500
Hey.

1185
01:48:54,493 --> 00:00:00,000
I was worried about you.

1186
01:48:56,963 --> 01:48:58,954
You were worried about me?

1187
01:49:00,205 --> 01:49:01,794
Yeah.

1188
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:05,541
I guessed Edward
would read my thoughts.

1189
01:49:08,244 --> 00:00:00,000
Was he hard on you?

1190
01:49:10,393 --> 01:49:14,387
He wasn't even mad at me.
Or you.

1191
01:49:15,647 --> 01:49:17,447
Well, damn.

1192
01:49:19,620 --> 01:49:21,560
He's better than I thought.

1193
01:49:22,224 --> 01:49:24,244
He's not playing a game.

1194
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:27,570
Right.

1195
01:49:31,026 --> 01:49:33,006
Bella...

1196
01:49:35,705 --> 01:49:38,960
He's not as perfect
as you think.

1197
01:49:41,925 --> 01:49:43,962
I know who he is.

1198
01:49:48,067 --> 01:49:50,647
I must not talk about that.

1199
01:49:51,644 --> 01:49:54,867
I'd rather get all the rebreaking
done at once.

1200
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:03,977
At least I know
I did everything I could.

1201
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:10,986
Wasn't easy making you
admit your feelings for me.

1202
01:50:13,985 --> 01:50:17,307
I only fought them, because I know
they wouldn't change anything.

1203
01:50:25,399 --> 01:50:28,497
I'm exactly right for you,
Bella.

1204
01:50:30,854 --> 01:50:35,854
It would be as easy
as breathing with me.

1205
01:50:41,514 --> 01:50:43,914
You know I love you.

1206
01:50:50,609 --> 01:50:53,735
You know how much
I wish it was enough.

1207
01:51:05,392 --> 01:51:06,847
Should I come back?

1208
01:51:09,615 --> 01:51:12,049
I need some time.

1209
01:51:16,069 --> 01:51:18,748
But I'll always be waiting.

1210
01:51:23,193 --> 01:51:26,208
Untill my heart stops beating.

1211
01:51:28,254 --> 01:51:30,638
Maybe even then.

1212
01:51:52,686 --> 00:00:00,000
- August thirteenth?
- Yeah.

1213
01:51:55,662 --> 00:00:00,000
it's a month
before my birthday.

1214
01:51:57,659 --> 01:51:59,750
I don't need to be
another year older than you.

1215
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:03,660
Alice said she can get
the wedding together by then.

1216
01:52:04,612 --> 01:52:06,308
I'm sure she can.

1217
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:10,205
There's no rush.

1218
01:52:12,728 --> 00:00:00,000
I've chosen my life.
I want to start living it.

1219
01:52:16,939 --> 01:52:20,260
And so, you're gonna let Alice
plan the whole thing?

1220
01:52:20,807 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

1221
01:52:22,084 --> 00:00:00,000
Dress, the reception,
the guest list...

1222
01:52:25,165 --> 01:52:27,888
I mean, who knows
who she's gonna invite?

1223
01:52:30,073 --> 01:52:31,594
Does it matter?

1224
01:52:36,164 --> 00:00:00,000
I just don't know
why you're doing this.

1225
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:40,885
What? The wedding?

1226
01:52:44,537 --> 01:52:46,946
You're trying to make
everyone else happy.

1227
01:52:48,117 --> 01:52:50,552
But you're already
giving away too much.

1228
01:52:51,724 --> 01:52:53,210
You're wrong.

1229
01:53:01,201 --> 01:53:04,757
This wasn't a choice
between you and Jacob.

1230
01:53:08,297 --> 01:53:12,652
It was between who I should be
and who I am.

1231
01:53:16,201 --> 01:53:18,228
I've always felt out of step.

1232
01:53:19,171 --> 01:53:21,641
Like literally,
stumbling through my life.

1233
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:26,094
I'm never felt normal.

1234
01:53:28,846 --> 01:53:30,908
Because I'm not normal.

1235
01:53:32,070 --> 01:53:34,056
I don't wanna be.

1236
01:53:35,107 --> 00:00:00,000
I've had to face death...

1237
01:53:38,425 --> 00:00:00,000
and loss and pain,
in your world.

1238
01:53:42,401 --> 01:53:45,491
But, I've also never felt
stronger...

1239
01:53:48,391 --> 01:53:51,502
more real, more...
my self.

1240
01:53:53,542 --> 01:53:55,662
Because it's my world, too.

1241
01:53:59,026 --> 01:54:01,343
It's where I belong.

1242
01:54:07,689 --> 01:54:10,208
So, it's not just about me.

1243
01:54:11,988 --> 01:54:13,188
No, sorry.

1244
01:54:17,433 --> 01:54:20,455
I've made a mess trying
to figure all this out, but...

1245
01:54:21,516 --> 01:54:23,186
I wanna do it right.

1246
01:54:23,853 --> 00:00:00,000
And I wanna tie my self
to you,

1247
01:54:26,768 --> 01:54:29,328
in every way
humanly possible.

1248
01:54:32,545 --> 01:54:34,568
Starting with a wedding.

1249
01:54:38,490 --> 00:00:00,000
Actually...

1250
01:54:40,750 --> 00:00:00,000
Something,
a little more difficult first.

1251
01:54:44,259 --> 01:54:46,364
And maybe even dangerous.

1252
01:54:51,474 --> 01:54:53,575
We have to tell Charlie.

1253
01:54:57,039 --> 00:00:00,000
It's highly dangerous.

1254
01:54:59,258 --> 01:55:01,437
It's a good thing
you're bulletproof.

1255
01:55:03,642 --> 01:55:05,924
I'm gonna need that ring.
