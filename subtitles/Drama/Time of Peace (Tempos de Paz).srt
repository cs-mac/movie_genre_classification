Feng Ying went to find you?

00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,490
No wait. Listen to me first. Even though he is a bit annoying and the way he talks can be blunt,

55
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,110
don't take it to heart.

56
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,990
Let me tell you. Even though I am an assistant, I am the one making the decisions here.

57
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,080
- Huh? 
<i> - Take it easy first.</i>

58
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,620
What did you say?

59
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,940
<i> Yong Ze and I have decided to join Team Shadow.</i>

60
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,230
You guys decided to join Team Shadow?!

61
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,760
Okay. Bye bye.

62
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,540
Why didn't you tell me?

63
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,060
How did you make him change his mind?

64
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,530
- Me? 
 - That's right.

65
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,070
I didn't do anything.

66
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,120
Why would they decide to join Team Shadow if you didn't do anything?

67
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,820
They probably thought it through.

68
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,060
With a world class cyclist like me on the team,

69
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,130
to regain the glory that Team Shadow once had

70
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,670
has a high chance of happening.

71
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,090
Please. It's obvious that you're telling me bull crap.

72
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,420
Listen. As the saying goes,

73
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,340
"It's harder to be cold when you see each other face to face."

74
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,990
He was probably moved by my sincerity yesterday.

75
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,510
Also, there is another important point.

76
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,860
It must be my looks.

77
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,130
It's all right, not a big deal. It's not much. You don't have to thank me.

78
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,730
Yay! This is great!

79
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,570
Happy! Happy!

82
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,740
Brother Bao.

83
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,960
Are you sure you want these two with absolutely no talent?

84
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,760
To you, they are just bench warmers,

85
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,980
but to me, they deserve better.

86
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,170
Let's be clear.

87
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,720
Back then, it was Shen Qing who begged

88
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,150
Brother Bao to kindly take these two in.

89
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,300
And now we have to give you those two just because you asked?

90
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,540
<i> What do think Team Hurricane is? A shelter?</i>

91
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,000
<i> That's right.</i>

92
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,870
I wouldn't come and ask for them with nothing.

93
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,750
How much is the compensation fee to terminate their contracts?

94
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,400
Just tell me directly.

95
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,130
Going straight to the point. You're direct.

96
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,520
But I don't need money. I won't sell no matter what the amount is.

97
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,620
So what do you want?

98
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,770
It's simple.

99
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,100
You versus me, one on one.

100
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,260
If you win, then I will give you both of their contracts.

101
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,030
You can do whatever you want with them.

102
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,300
But if you lose,

103
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,510
I want Team Shadow to disband immediately.

104
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,960
And you, to return to the States.

105
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,020
Hey, you are going overboard.

106
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,760
Brother Bao this is a matter between us. It has nothing to do with Feng Ying.

107
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,930
How does it not concern Feng Ying? Today it is he who came to me for the contracts today.

108
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,050
What? Pride of Taiwan, are you afraid?

109
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,990
And I was wondering what it could be.

110
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,080
It turns out you merely want to race against me.

111
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,720
Sure, I accept.

112
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,710
- Hey, Feng Ying! 
 <i> - I don't agree to it! I don't agree to it!</i>

113
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,910
I don't agree to it! What kind of crappy place is this? So hard to find parking and I can't drive here.

114
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,540
I don't agree to it. I don't agree to it.

115
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,850
What were you guys saying just now?

116
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,080
You went to the wrong side!

117
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,840
What were you guys saying just now?

118
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,510
Brother Bao said he wants to have a one on one race, and if Feng Ying loses, Team Shadow will have to disband.

119
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,610
You are taking too much a risk. I don't agree to this.

120
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,150
Don't you worry. I will definitely not lose.

121
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:55,580
As long as the green hills are around,  you can always find firewood to burn.

122
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,210
Speed up! Speed up!

123
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,160
Persevere!

124
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,550
Stop.

125
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,950
Don't stop your legs. Hands on the drops!

126
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,280
Hurry!

127
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:33,180
Feng Ying. They sent us the time and location.

128
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,490
I am adamant on my standpoint. I disagree with this.

129
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,040
Same here.

130
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,920
I know it doesn't feel good,

131
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,380
but we will use the fairest and most open method.

132
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,190
We will conduct an...

133
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,830
Internal vote within Team Shadow.

134
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,150
That's a great idea. Majority rules.

135
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,490
Vote?

136
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,040
Yes.

137
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,260
Please raise your hand if you don't think we should accept Brother Bao's challenge.

138
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,500
- I am against it. 
 - I also disagree.

139
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,540
There are so many cyclists. We can find other ones.

140
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,020
We don't have to risk it for those two.

141
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,820
Excuse me. May I interrupt?

142
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,110
To be honest, I don't agree either.

143
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,560
Because Brother Bao is best at riding on mountain road, so if he doesn't choose a course on the mountain...

144
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,270
No, he will most definitely choose a track in the mountain. It will be too unfair to you.

145
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,210
That's right. It's too risky.

146
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,140
If Team Shadow is racing just because of the two of us,

147
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,670
we will feel apologetic.

148
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,260
See?

149
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,990
The weather looks great today.

150
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,350
We have not done enough sprinting, so let me ask again.

151
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,850
Do you agree for me to accept Brother Bao's challenge?

152
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,380
- I agree! 
 - I agree!

153
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,970
Another vote from me. See?

154
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,320
All right. I will go to scout the location.

155
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,750
David, Ai Li, give Xiao Long and Yong Zhe an orientation.

156
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,470
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

157
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,960
Go to do some research on the history of Brother Bao.

158
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,850
You are better than Ji Zi Qi at grasping the key point.

159
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,030
Hey, I--

160
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,710
And you,

161
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,080
follow me.

162
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,770
What are you saying?  You should believe in democracy.

163
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,000
I am very capable too!

164
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,000
<i>Hey!</i>

165
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,100
You do care about Team Shadow, right?

166
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,990
You are not the kind who, in case you lose the competition and Team Shadow disbands,

167
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,520
can just go back to the States unbothered, right?

168
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,000
Even if I don't care about Team Shadow,

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,730
I would still care about my own reputation, okay?

170
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,300
Is the team yours or mine?

171
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,400
Yours.

172
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,000
When I first went to the States, I practiced in the mountainous area every day.

173
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I have even won the title of King of the Mountains.

174
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,600
This is my advantage. Brother Bao doesn't know about it.

175
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,200
Team Shadow will most definitely not disband.

176
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,800
Please believe in your Chief, okay?

177
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,800
I believe, I believe. Chief,

178
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,200
go!

179
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,400
Go! Go! Go! Scout the location! Go!

180
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
<i> I must figure out why</i>

181
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,100
<i> you care about Team Shadow so much.</i>

182
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,500
Why is there white smoke coming out?

183
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,360
Why does it feel weird?

184
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,000
<i> What are you doing?</i>

185
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,600
What are you doing? What's going on?

186
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,700
Let's get off first to take a look.

187
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,300
It seems that the radiator might have broken. Or that all the engine oil has leaked?

188
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,900
This Han Sen! He doesn't regularly inspect the vehicle.

189
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,400
Wait here for a bit.

190
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,400
I will go to take a look up front about the road condition of the race course.

191
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,900
Hold up!

192
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,200
The car is like this already and you're still going to check on the road condition?

193
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,600
Don't you want to deal with this first?

194
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,200
Are you the assistant here or am I?

195
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,600
Call and ask for roadside assistance! Do I have to tell you what to do, Big Sister?

196
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Fine, I got it!

197
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,800
Don't go too far.

198
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,000
What do you need from me?

199
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,600
I want to remind you that about this competition, you can't afford to lose.

200
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,100
I know.

201
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,200
If I win, no one will be able to take what belongs to you.

202
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,900
But if I lose,

203
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,300
you will probably feel troubled.

204
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,100
This is a newly developed drug that will enhance your explosiveness.

205
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,500
Rest early.

206
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,600
An athlete's sleep is very important, isn't it?

207
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,100
Did you take care of the things that I told you about?

208
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,260
Okay. If this is done well, then we are even.

209
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:54,870
I don't need drugs to win against Feng Ying.

210
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,500
Feng Ying!

211
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,400
Not answering?!

212
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,200
So there you are. Why didn't you answer?

213
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,530
Hey, look--

214
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,620
Hold tight!

215
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,800
Ji Zi Qi! Hold tight!

216
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,130
Hold on tight!

217
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,000
Almost there! Pull harder!

218
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,400
<i> Hold tight!</i>

219
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,800
Hold tight! Hold tight!

220
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
I am almost out of strength!

221
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,900
I won't let go!

222
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,800
Almost there! You can do it!

223
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,000
Pull harder! I will pull you up!

224
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,400
<i> Don't let go!</i>

225
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,900
It's fine now!

226
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,200
It's fine now!

227
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,900
It was so scary.

228
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,600
I am still shaking...

229
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,400
<i> It was so scary.</i>

230
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,800
Don't be scared. You're fine now.

231
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
Don't be scared.

232
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,200
- So scary... 
 <i> - It's all good now.</i>

233
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
It scared me.

234
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,700
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

235
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,200
Thank you.

236
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,000
Thank you, Chief.

237
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,800
Are you snoring?

238
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,900
Oh my god!

239
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,800
And he is always saying how handsome he is,

240
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,400
how awesome he is. That he is a Shadow.

241
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,200
But now, he is a Shadow pig! Sleeping like a pig.

242
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,400
I must to record this and save it!

243
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,200
This is too good.

244
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,680
Let's see if you dare to order me around in the future.

245
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,950
<i>I know that you won't reply to my messages anymore,</i>

246
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:20,410
<i>But this is the only way to make me feel</i>

247
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,380
<i>like I can still talk to you.</i>

248
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,320
<i>Today, I finally mustered up the courage to message you.</i>

249
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,250
<i>How are you?</i>

250
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,360
<i>Do you miss me?</i>

251
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,440
<i>I know you will never reply,</i>

252
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:54,360
<i>but I want you to know that I will always love you.</i>

253
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,330
Why would I dream about Ji Zi Qi?

254
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,550
This dream is so realistic.

255
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,010
Go, go, go!

256

You lie to me every time!

285
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,510
I don't lie. I'm very gentle.

<i>Ouch, ouch! It hurts!</i>

287
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,850
Xiao Long, Yong Ze, when you go home today, pack your things and move over here.

288
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:10,770
Before Tour de Taiwan race is over, everyone needs to be managed together.

289
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,990
I'm sorry, but what about my private life?

290
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:21,270
And my personal time?

291
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,440
We didn't bring you here to have a party, okay?

292
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,550
<i> Living together is for easier management and standardized training.</i>

293
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,960
<i> And develop team spirit, understand?</i>

294
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,770
That's right.

295
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,650
Right, Chief?

296
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,280
Fine, I will go easy on you this time.

297
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,520
Thank you.

298
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,090
You!

299
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,990
Huh?

300
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,690
Shadow, are you okay with the race tomorrow?

301
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,530
That Brother Bao is really strong.

302
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:48,320
Especially on mountain road, he just ride through it like no one else.

303
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,480
And he got the first place in Taiwan before.

304
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,250
He's like Nezha sitting on the Fire Wheels. <i>(Zezha: Chinese mythological character)</i>

305
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,300
Ready?

306
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,940
I heard Ji Zi Qi has a boyfriend.

307
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,380
What boyfriend? Who?

308
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,610
Stop talking nonsense.

309
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,380
The dream I had yesterday... I dreamt of her again.

310
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,910
In the dream, she sent me a text message.

311
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,230
And she had long hair.

312
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,300
You dreamt about Ji Zi Qi...

313
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,050
Why are you talking so loud?

314
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,190
They say dream is your subconscious,

315
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,510
a desire that is deep within you.

316
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,130
I think this dream is most likely telling you to pursue Ji Zi Qi.

317
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,080
Me? Pursuing Ji Zi Qi?

318
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,010
I think it's most likely that there is some problem with my brain.

319
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,030
Ji Zi Qi with long hair might look pretty good.

320
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,060
Look good? What good?

321
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,840
It's still two noses and one eye.

322
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,080
I really want to see what Ji Zi Qi looks like with two noses

323
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,830
and one eye.

324
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,950
Cut the crap.

325
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,800
Two noses, one eye.

326
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,400
Grab his hand.

327
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:38,650
<i>Do you still remember the first time you fell asleep next to me?</i>

328
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,840
<i> I really want to know how are you doing now.</i>

329
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,020
<i>Do you still remember Onion? I went to see it today.</i>

330
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:52,320
<i>If possible, I really want to see you play with it again.</i>

331
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,790
<i>I know that you probably will never reply,</i>

332
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,520
<i>but I still want to say</i>

333
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,080
<i>I will always love you.</i>

334
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,410
Do you know why this is?

335
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,310
Why does it say "read"?

336
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:15,630
"Read" indicates that the other person has seen it.

337
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,810
The other person has seen it?

338
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,030
Do you want to confirm one more time?

339
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,640
Are you sure the other person has seen it?

340
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,970
You must know why, right?

341
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:32,850
Miss, do you want to call your friend to confirm?

342
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,420
Call?

343
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:44,370
I really want to call him too.

344
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,530
So, you're sure he's seen it?

345
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,790
Yes, he must have seen it.

346
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,550
Then, if you have any more problem,

347
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,710
please let me know. I will go on and work.

348
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,170
He has seen it, he has seen it.

349
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,000
You have seen it.

350
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,400
You really replied to me.

351
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,140
I am sorry. Thank you.

352
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,450
<i>Did you sleep well last night?</i>

353
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,520
I slept very well.

354
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,290
He needed to practice, and pack for returning to the States.

355
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,730
How could he sleep well?

356
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,140
I know everyone calls you the glory of Taiwan.

357
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,970
Your popularity is more than what Ji Fong had.

358
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:06,120
But in the field of cycling, we only talk about skill, not popularity.

359
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,860
Let me tell you. Over confidence becomes arrogance. You will become a joke.

360
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,410
Whether it is confidence or arrogance,

361
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,950
you will find out after the race.

362
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,680
It was Shen Qing who begged me to kindly take in these two.

363
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,990
I thought people trained by a famous coach must have decent skills,

364
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:25,700
but they made me realized,

365
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,260
as expected, all legends are exaggerated.

366
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,840
Famous coach is really nothing more than words.

367
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:37,090
Brother Bao, even though I am a part of Team Hurricane now,

368
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:40,210
I won't let you insult Coach Shen.

369
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,140
Whom do you think you are talking to?

370
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,810
- Look who's talking, traitor.
- What did you just say?

371
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,460
I just called you a traitor. Don't you like it?

372
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,200
Say it again. What did you say?

373
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,440
- Say it again!
- Louder!

374
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,520
- Shadow! 
 <i> - Hurricane!</i>

375
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,760
That's enough.

376
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:10,400
Cut the bull crap and let's start the competition.

377
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,000
Not a problem. I can't wait to see your defeated look.

378
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,100
Are you ready?

379
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,100
Ready!

380
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,800
<i> - Go! 
 - Go, go, go!</i>

381
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,600
<i> - Brother Bao, go! 
 - You can do it!</i>

382
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,000
Go!

383
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,400
- Brother Bao, go! 
 - You can do it!

384
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,000
What's wrong? Your are the cyclist returning from abroad.

385
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
You can't bike without girls next to you now?

386
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,710
Catch up with me!

387
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,800
Catch up with me! Speed!

388
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,600
♫ <i>The name you wrote disappears from my palm</i> ♫

389
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,200
♫ <i>I can't remember your smile</i> ♫

390
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:28,950
♫ <i>Don't care about the depth</i> ♫ 
♫ <i> Without the baggage for an idol</i> ♫

391
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:33,010
♫ <i>Fun is the best kind of art</i> ♫

392
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:37,030
♫ <i>Absent any preconceived notions</i> ♫ 
♫ <i> Or any constraints</i> ♫

393
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:41,020
♫ <i>A pot of cooked curry sauce can also go with yams</i> ♫

394
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,600
Glory of Taiwan, is your specialty taking a fall?

395
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,100
I'll go on ahead.

396
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,800
<i> That's strange. Didn't I inspect my wheels yesterday?</i>

397
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,900
<i> Why is there so much sand on the wheels?</i>

398
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,600
Looking at the time, they should be at the last segment of the path.

399
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,000
Hey, hey!  Hey, hey.

400
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,100
Don't you think it's strange that they are not worried at all?

401
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,500
They are doing it on purpose. It's a strategy and they are purposely showing it in front of us.

402
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,600
But it's Chief who's competing and not us,

403
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,200
why would they show that in front of us?

404
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,900
You have a point.

405
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,300
Chief!

406
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,160
Brother Bao!

407
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,400
<i>- Chief is back!
- Chief.</i>

408
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,400
<i> - How did that happen? 
 - Brother Bao!</i>

409
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,230
<i> - They are back! 
 - Chief! 
 - Brother Bao!</i>

410
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,600
<i> Let me help you! Are you okay?</i>

411
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,300
<i> Be careful! Jin Cheng!</i>

412
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,200
- Let's help him to the pavilion.
- Hurry.

413
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,200
How did you get injured so badly?

414
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,800
Brother Bao, what happened?

415
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,600
Hey, come here!

416
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,200
- How is he?
- Be careful!

417
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,200
Hurry and help him in here!

418
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,500
<i> Brother Bao, be careful!</i>

419
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,180
<i> How did you get injured this badly? What's the result?</i>

420
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,300
<i> What happened to the competition?</i>

421
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,700
How did you get injured this badly? What happened?

422
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,550
It must be Brother Bao. Let me talk to him!

423
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,200
I am fine.

424
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,000
There's always a risk with mountain bike racing.

425
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,800
No one did anything. It's I who fell carelessly.

426
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,600
Let me treat your wound. I will get the First Aid kit.

427
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,400
Chief, is it because there was an issue with your bike?

428
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,000
That's right. We really waited for you for a long time.

429
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,800
I found that there was a lot of sand and small rocks stuck on my wheels.

430
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,600
That's why I keep saying that you must inspect your bike before a competition. Understand?

431
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,800
- Understood.
 - Understood.

432
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,400
Bear with me.

433
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,700
Here I come.

434
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,880
- Is it okay? 
 - It's fine.

435
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,700
How did this happen?

436
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,900
Bear with me.

437
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,000
<i> What now?</i>

438
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,700
<i> Are you here to laugh at me? Go on with your bike!</i>

439
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,040
<i> Go away!</i>

440
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,220
How did the competition go? Who won?

441
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,070
You won, right? Brother Bao?

442
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,380
I said shut up!

443
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,490
Why was there sand?

444
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,710
<i> Is it okay?</i>

445
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,220
<i> It's okay.</i>

446
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:47,450
You seem pretty good at treating wounds. Have you learned it before?

447
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:49,270
My dad taught me.

448
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:51,800
- You dad taught you? 
 <i> - Yes.</i>

449
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,520
This competition ended because of me.

450
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,480
It counts as a loss for me.

451
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,820
Here are Zhong Xiao Long and Wang Yong Ze's contracts.

452
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,990
Let's go.

453
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,440
<i> - Brother Bao. 
 - Brother Bao.</i>

454
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,800
<i>Brother Bao...</i>

455
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,650
<i> Hello?</i>

456
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,280
I lost the competition.

457
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,550
And I terminated the contract.

458
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,260
<i> You rubbish.</i>

459
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,970
<i> Here, here.</i>

460
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:14,140
Look here, everyone. More dishes!

461
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,400
Knock yourself out! We still have a lot!

462
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,190
- There is really a lot of food. 
 - Eat lots!

463
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,280
Yong Ze, the food at your restaurant is really good.

464
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,150
Right? So good.

465
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,360
This, this is our signature dish. You must try it!

466
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,140
It's really good!

467
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,420
Let's do it together. Let's have a toast today,

468
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,400
celebrating the official debut of Team Shadow. Let's drink up!

469
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,460
Cheers!

470
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:39,160
Cheers!

471
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,440
You love drinking so much. Are you trying to get drunk or are you trying to get Team Shadow drunk?

472
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,230
Brother Han Sen, it's such a joyous occasion today. Here, let me give you a toast.

473
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,630
<i> Let's all drink together.</i>

474
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,390
Let's drink up.

475
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:53,510
It's such a happy day today.

476
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,930
<i>Let's drink up.</i>

477
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,320
What are we toasting to here?

478
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,930
I know. For Chief,

479
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:00,560
to stay healthy and wish him all the best!

480
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,030
<i> Wishing you good luck and prosperity.</i>

481
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,650
I wish you boundless happiness and a long, long life.

482
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:08,380
Brother Han Sen is really good at spewing nonsense.

483
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:11,360
I have been wanting to ask this for a while.

484
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,040
Why did Chief go back to save Brother Bao?

485
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,970
Isn't it easier to just head to the finish line?

486
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,520
This is victory multiplied by four.

487
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,650
Wow, that's amazing, but it's too cruel.

488
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:21,960
I am confiscating this, not going to let you eat this.

489
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,970
<i> That's okay.</i>

490
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:27,060
<i> I will just drink.</i>

491
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,560
<i> Drink more.</i>

492
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,870
Delivery girl.

493
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:35,760
- What? 
 - You...

494
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,090
What?

495
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:39,190
Nice one.

496
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:46,190
To be honest, from the first moment I saw you, I already knew you were great.

497
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,220
That's enough. Let me tell you, to be honest,

498
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:54,060
I also knew from the second moment I saw you,

499
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,360
you're not that annoying. Not bad.

500
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,620
- Cheers? 
 - Okay! After this, the past is in the past.

501
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:08,250
We are finally free!

502
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:11,000
I am so touched.

503
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:19,710
We are really getting closer to the Tour de Taiwan race.

504
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:21,860
We have to work hard together.

505
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,680
Chief, congratulations! We, as Team Shadow,

506
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,880
are finally established.

507
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,780
Ai Li, let's cheers together.

508
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,120
<i>I am a little tipsy.</i>

509
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,260
<i>Come on.</i>

510
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,380
Cheers!

511
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,790
<i>Don't drink it yourself.</i> Let's do it together.

512
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:41,390
Come on, Team Shadow,

513
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,310
go, go, go!

514
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,400
<i> Woah, he is drinking from an empty glass.</i>

515
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,340
<i> No, I drank some.</i>

516
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,850
<i> You drank from an empty glass!</i>

517
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:52,420
<i> No, it was full!</i>

518
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,230
<i>-  Three more as a punishment. 
 - No...</i>

519
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:56,310
<i> No, I can't drink that much.</i>

520
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:57,760
Cheers!

521
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:06,810
How are you so good at drinking?

522
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:14,160
It's probably because I used to drink with my roommate.

523
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:17,240
Impressive, right?

524
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:25,470
Oh right. I didn't get a chance to ask because of the competition.

525
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:29,630
Your last name is Ji, and you are so interested in cycling.

526
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,570
And your dad taught you how to treat wound.

527
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:35,840
In the cycling field, there aren't a lot of people whose family name is Ji.

528
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:38,870
Your dad should be Ji Fong.

529
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:44,430
My dad is Ji Fong.

530
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:46,790
Isn't he good looking?

531
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:49,200
As expected.

532
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,690
Let me tell you.

533
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:58,080
My dad is so handsome.

534
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,700
My dad was the key member of Team Shadow.

535
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,700
He was carrying the weight of all the Taiwanese fans' expectation

536
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,810
and hope on his shoulder.

537
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:14,050
And also Coach Shen's dream.

538
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:20,430
My dad's only wish was to get the champion on the Tour de Taiwan race.

539
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,610
Carrying my grandpa's dream?

540
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:32,370
Why are you crying?

541
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:36,690
- I always want to cry when I get to this part. 
 - Drink up.

542
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,310
Alcoholic, have a drink.

543
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,700
Hey,

544
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:53,750
I want to ask you something.

545
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,160
Do you know where Coach Shen is?

546
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:14,310
Why is everyone asking me for my grandpa's whereabouts?

547
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:18,130
I want to know more than any of you.

548
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,760
Everyone thinks of him as an inspirational figure,

549
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,650
and respects him. But has any of you ever thought that

550
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:26,750
Team Shadow...

551
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,840
What about Team Shadow?

552
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,520
Drink up.

553
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,960
Cheers!

554
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,330
Think hard about

555
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,740
how we are going to bring these drunks back.

556
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:53,000
And tomorrow morning we will have to gather everyone to have our first training practice.

557
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:04,410
Let me tell you. I can't do it. Even though I am strong,

558
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:08,810
it's too heavy. I really can't do it.

559
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,460
I will rely on you.

560
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:17,760
You have so much left.

561
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,490
Drink up! Finish this.

562
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:26,730
<i> Cheers! Team Shadow, go! Team Shadow is the best!</i>

563
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:35,220
<i> If Ji Zi Qi was the one who sent the message,</i>

564
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,640
<i> why does she seem so sad in the future?</i>

565
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,140
<i>I am still adjusting to the days without you by my side.</i>

566
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:45,360
<i>I really want to know how are you doing now.</i>

567
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:34,090
♫ <i>Don't care about the depth</i> ♫ 
♫ <i> Without the baggage for an idol</i> ♫

568
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:38,030
♫ <i>Fun is the best kind of art</i> ♫

569
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:42,080
♫ <i>Absent any preconceived notions</i> ♫ 
♫ <i> Or any constraints</i> ♫

570
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:46,080
♫ <i>A pot of cooked curry sauce can also go with yams</i> ♫

571
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:26,180
[ YOU KNOW ] 
 [ SHADOW ] 
 [ 2018 ]

572
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,620
[ YOU KNOW ] 
 [ SHADOW ] 
 [ 2018 ]

573
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:31,640
[ YOU KNOW ] 
 [ SHADOW ] 
 [ 2018 ]

574
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,050
Everyone, wake up!

575
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,250
<i> How much longer will it take?</i>

576
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:57,770
Move faster!

577
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:00,690
Stop slacking.

578
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:04,880
How much longer will it take? Assemble in five minutes.

579
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,640
Hurry up!

580
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,260
Are you playing around?

581
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,200
Hurry, hurry!

582
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,320
It's...

583
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:18,070
Time!

584
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:21,870
- Report to Chief, everyone is here. 
 - Count off!

585
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,640
- One. 
 - Two. 
 - Three, uh....

586
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,160
Three.

587
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,990
Four.

588
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:30,290
Where's Han Sen?

589
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:32,440
Opportunities are reserved for the ones who are prepared.

590
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:35,120
What are you waiting for? Hurry and go!

591
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,600
Good morning.

592
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,720
Good morning.

593
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,050
I have a day off today. I am the assistant's assistant.

594
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:05,580
Good morning.

595
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:09,230
Hi.

596
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,430
Good morning.

597
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,940
Good morning.

598
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,880
That concludes Aster's marketing plan for CI108.

599
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:38,670
Our marketing plan for CI108 spans over 10 years,

600
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:41,850
which goes to show we attach great importance to influenza vaccination.

601
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:44,530
I believe in the following 10 years,

602
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:47,970
the efforts by Aster on CI108

603
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:50,930
will supersede everyone else in the industry.

604
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:53,530
This part does sound appealing,

605
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:55,610
but it seems that your company

606
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:59,670
did not include our opinion about commission in the report.

607
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:05,190
About this part, we did receive information about your requirements,

608
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:08,520
but with all due respect, after all, all the benefits come from the same source.

609
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,250
Compared to food safety, drug safety is even stricter,

610
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,050
and of greater importance.

611
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:15,480
If we only care about cutting price for competition,

612
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,490
we will just repeat the same mistakes in recent years on food safety.

613
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,910
I believe, for a big factory with hundred of years of history like yours,

614
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:32,090
profit is definitely not the first priority in your plan.

615
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,250
CEO, should we listen to the Chairman's advice and discount by 2%?

616
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:51,020
In order to obtain the distribution rights of CI108,

617
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,720
Aster spent about seven years.

618
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:58,230
I dare to say, I know better about CI108 than any of you here.

619
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:01,080
To be honest, I even regard CI108 as my personal research project.

620
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,470
I can sell it even with my eyes closed.

621
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,350
I believe what CEO said is true,

622
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:16,510
but the headquarters still some additional consideration.

623
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,120
<i> Excuse me.</i>

624
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,570
<i> Hello? Please go on.</i>

625
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,180
<i> Okay.</i>

626
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:30,270
<i> Yes. I understand.</i>

627
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:41,490
Our headquarters fully understand the intent of your company.

628
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:46,050
Therefore, we agree to giving Aster the distribution rights of CI108.

629
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:47,950
Happy to work with you.

630
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,560
Congratulations.

631
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,310
- Happy to work with you.
- Congratulations.

632
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:10,030
CEO, our company have been trying to get CI108 for years.

633
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:12,550
Even Chairman wasn't able to get the distribution rights,

634
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:15,750
today, CEO, you did it.

635
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:19,870
This is such a great achievement. The Chairman must be happy.

636
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:34,320
Yes.

637
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:37,420
Okay, I understand. I will arrange immediately.

638
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:42,260
CEO, the Chairman said

639
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:44,860
he wants to eat with you tomorrow night.

640
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:47,370
Someone must have told him about the result just now.

641
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,190
Is that right? The news spread so quickly.

642
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:56,260
Then I am going to head out first.

643
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:03,450
Right, CEO, congratulations.

644
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:25,190
<i>[ Wei Wei: are you still in the meeting? You sacrificed so much for CI108. ]</i>

645
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:45,100
<i> Dad, your wish is finally starting to come true again.</i>

646
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:52,020
<i> your wish is finally starting to come true again.</i>

647
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:56,150
<i> Mom, today is the official first day of Team Shadow's re-establishment.</i>

648
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:59,430
<i> We finally took the first step.</i>

649
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,090
<i> - I won't disappoint you. 
 - I won't disappoint you.</i>

650
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,740
Go, go!

651
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,520
<i> Anyone wants to eat?</i>

652
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,330
I do!

653
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:53,390
<i>What?</i>

654
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:54,500
<i>Give me a push.</i>

655
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,170
<i>And this.</i>

656
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:16,240
Hey! Why are you so childish!

664
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:40,230
Not bad, huh? It was pretty good today.

665
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:44,540
We can enter Tour de Taiwan race now.

<i>He is such a monster.</i>

667
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,330
Look at Chief,

668
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:11,030
we ran on the beach today,

669
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:13,640
and then biked for more than 100 kilometers,

670
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,150
and he can still take his time to clean his bike.

671
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:18,700
I think this is really over the top. I can't believe this.

672
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:21,020
To be honest, this amount of training wasn't that much.

673
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:23,910
You haven't experienced the training that we had half a year before the competition when we were in the States.

674
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:25,840
That was truly hell.

675
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,900
Right, Ai Li?

676
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,550
Right.

677
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:33,370
David, how exactly was your training in the States?

678
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:37,680
You will know when you have off-site training anyway.

679
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,090
Right.

680
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:41,650
I know everyone worked hard,

681
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:45,760
but you guys are already half way in, if you want to drop out now...

682
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:49,060
No way!

683
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:01,220
Water.

684
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,710
Here.

685
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:14,440
It seems that you dad taught you a lot.

686
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,040
You know bikes pretty well.

687
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,750
Also, seeing how you biked today, you're not bad.

688
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:23,960
As expected, you do have some talent.

689
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,960
He is actually complimenting me?

690
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,880
Oh...

691
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,810
My dad really taught me a lot.

692
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:33,990
I really like cycling, so I studied on my own.

693
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:36,480
It's just that, no matter how much I study,

694
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,300
I can't match up with professional cyclists like you.

695
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:42,710
Of course, you can't match up with professional cyclists like us.

696
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:45,140
If you can, what does it make of us?

697
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:50,450
Let me tell you. If I am serious,

698
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:52,930
even you will be scared of me.

699
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:55,170
Hey! What are you doing?

700
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:59,360
For a bike that belongs to me, Shadow, do you think you can just touch it?

701
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,690
Let me tell you, it is gold-plated.

702
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,520
<i> I must touch it.</i>

703
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,170
<i>Touch.</i>

704
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:15,720
Yu Zhen, is it you?

705
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:18,890
- What are you doing? 
 - Thinking.

706
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:20,650
About what?

707
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,410
Thinking of you.

708
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:27,020
Do you want some water?

709
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:29,240
You know, an English study shows that

710
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:33,520
everyone who died on Earth had drunken water beforehand.

711
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,530
I even know, if you keep saying nonsense,

712
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:38,860
I will beat you to death.

713
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:41,880
Dying in your hands is my honor too.

714
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:48,630
Excuse me. Allow me to take the call first.

715
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,090
Hello?

716
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:52,430
Yes. What?

717
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:54,490
Shooting a commercial tomorrow?

718
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:57,040
But it's not on our schedule.

719
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:00,240
Let me tell you. For something of such a short notice, I will not agree to it.

720
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,200
Wasn't I cool?

721
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,280
As a world class manager, a case that I accept on your behalf must be a top case.

722
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,980
Put up a good show later. I will take care of everything else.

723
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:29,860
- Okay 
 - Got it.

724
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:31,630
Do your best!

725
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:34,210
Everyone, you are shooting a commercial soon!  So cool.

726
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:37,370
Do your best, everyone, do your best!

727
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:38,810
Do our best!

728
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:41,500
You usually don't look that special. After putting on clothes like these today,

729
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:44,290
you look pretty good.

730
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:46,060
Where is Feng Ying?

731
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:49,720
As a world class star athlete, of course the organizer prepared a...

732
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:52,330
VIP room?  So snotty.

733
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:53,850
Let me take a look.

734
01:03:58,270 --> 01:04:02,560
Wow, for sure it isn't the same for the international level.

735
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:16,950
Brother Shadow, let me put some makeup on for you.

736
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:18,480
Take off your jacket.

737
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,810
Why do I have to take off my jacket to put on makeup?

738
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:23,010
To make your more comfortable.

739
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:25,060
Come on.

740
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:29,130
Let me take it off for you.

741
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,030
What have you been doing lately?

742
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:35,670
Biking.

743
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:38,110
Do you make a lot of money biking?

744
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,060
What's your zodiac sign?

745
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,040
What blood type?

746
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,410
You are so buff.

747
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:49,780
Let me find something.

748
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,100
Brother Shadow, do you have a girlfriend?

749
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,750
Do you have a girlfriend?

750
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:09,420
Do you have a girlfriend?

751
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:12,310
What do you think about a type like me?

752
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:14,940
I think we are done with makeup here, right?

753
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:18,050
- I haven't done your hair yet.
- Thanks, thanks.

754
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,510
Thank you.

755
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:23,460
Brother Shadow!

756
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:28,020
I think... I really should go to find my teammates.

758

 - Director...

785
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:14,590
Hold on a second. What I want is not looking cool.

786
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:16,610
I think we are lacking some...

787
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:19,840
dramatic impact. Do you understand? Dramatic impact.

788
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:22,500
Dance okay?  Dance, can you do it?

789
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,680
Dance. I want dancing!

790
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,420
Again!

791
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:29,820
It's all your fault!

792
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:31,070
<i> If you guys make him unhappy,</i>

793
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:33,720
<i> then you are causing trouble for me! Do you understand?</i>

794
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,180
<i> Everyone, get out of the water!</i>

795
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:38,910
Get out of the water!

796
01:07:38,910 --> 01:07:41,690
<i> Biceps, biceps. Triceps, triceps.</i>

797
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:44,690
<i> Shoulder, shoulder. Remember to use your abs.</i>

798
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:46,890
<i> Biceps, biceps. Triceps, triceps.</i>

799
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:47,860
<i> Say it out loud!</i>

800
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:51,880
<i> Shoulder, shoulder. Remember to use your abs.</i>

801
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,420
<i> Biceps, biceps.</i>

802
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:58,040
<i>- Triceps, triceps. Shoulder, shoulder. 
 - Cut!</i>

803
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:01,200
<i> Biceps... Triceps...</i>

804
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:07,700
I still think we are lacking some...

805
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:11,190
aesthetics.

806
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:14,010
Pour water. Yes, pour water!

807
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:17,240
That's great. Pour water. Let's do it again.

808
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:20,280
Chief, the weather is so cold today, and they are going to pour water on us?

809
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,510
<i> Director said to pour water.</i>

810
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:23,390
<i> - Water! 
 - You should go to talk to him.</i>

811
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:25,170
Isn't this for charity?

812
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:27,710
Chief, I don't know what to say.

813
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:29,820
I'd rather go biking.

814
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:33,940
Hey, don't we practice cycling in the winter anyway? It's the same.

815
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:38,090
We are doing something for charity. Let's just endure for a bit.

816
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:04,720
<i> Art, is what makes people lose so many brain cells.</i>

817
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:09,760
<i> If we have liquid, it should also mean that we need to have solid as well?</i>

818
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,960
<i> Right. Ice!</i>

819
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,980
<i> It's so touching.</i>

820
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:18,870
<i> - Ice? 
 - Ice?</i>

821
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:21,000
<i> It's a brilliant idea.</i>

822
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,200
<i> That's what I like.</i>

823
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,670
I don't feel hot.

824
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,990
Isn't this too much?

825
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:46,360
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Our [ Right ] Time! Team @ viki</i>

827
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,540
<i>  Let's have dinner together tonight.</i>

828
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:56,150
<i> Being your boss, I have the responsibility to understand my employees.</i>

829
01:09:56,150 --> 01:10:00,410
<i> When you want to understand somebody, or something,</i>

830
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:03,620
<i> you can't just look at the surface.</i>

831
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:06,240
<i> You have to get near it,</i>

832
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,470
<i> get close to it.</i>

833
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:09,750
<i> Do you know what time it is right now?</i>

834
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:11,510
<i>Tada!</i>

835
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:14,540
<i> Sandwich, hot coffee.</i>

836
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:15,920
<i>  Am I not thoughtful?</i>

837
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,940
<i>Don't be so early!</i>

838
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:20,120
<i>  I said before that I will be responsible for my team's future.</i>
