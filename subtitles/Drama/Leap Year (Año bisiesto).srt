00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,995
Hello?

5
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,474
Hi Mom.

6
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,559
Fine and you?

7
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,074
How nice.
What are you doing?

8
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,277
Oh, it's raining?

9
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,395
It is already tomorrow is February.

10
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,391
What did you eat?

11
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,838
Delicious.

12
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,429
And who did,
you or Grandma?

13
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,834
Delicious...

14
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,514
Who?

15
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,799
Oh really?

16
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,550
Oh how nice.
You said hi for me?

17
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,519
Good afternoon. I'm Laura Lopez
the Your Business magazine.

18
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,077
Very well, thank you.
Is that you?

19
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,389
How nice.

20
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,594
Let me explain.

21
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,075
In the May issue
we will publish an article

22
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,113
30 tips to take advantage
the economic crisis.

23
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,993
And I wanted to ask, please,
you could share your ideas.

24
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,114
Exact.

25
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,552
Do you think he wants to build a
heritage for my sister and me?

26
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,638
But the father left that
property for me, Mom.

27
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,313
But Mom!

28
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,796
At the club I drink vodka.

29
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,752
I like the Mandarin.

30
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,553
So you're designer?

31
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,357
Listen, Raul.
I think she's an idiot.

32
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,793
She has light skin,
then you find hot.

33
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,999
Well, you know that, but I do not
I think that suits you.

34
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,315
It's all right...

35
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,599
Yes, I have eaten.

36
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,117
I ate with Miguel.

37
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,392
Actually he just left.

38
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,590
Yeah, let me sink
full of dirty dishes.

39
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,516
And made me a Chow Fan.

40
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,518
Chow Fan.

41
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,791
It is a Chinese fried rice.

42
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,638
He put shrimp.

43
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,159
He is fine,
It is again boyfriend.

44
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,915
Yeah, they went to Acapulco.

45
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,399
Exactly.

46
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,074
It's not like you
You are seeing them.

47
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,556
Because everyone is equal.

48
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,155
IT IS.

49
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,672
I know, the less you.

50
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,990
And what time did you say
him I was going to call?

51
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,428
It's all right,
then we'll talk tomorrow.

52
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,753
A kiss.

53
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,158
I love you so much.

54
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,474
I always use,
It is straightforward.

55
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,830
I have big, small,
of all flavors.

56
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,394
And there's no risk of infection.

57
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,475
That's incredible.

58
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,989
You can put both
lubricant you want.

59
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:27,744
Hello?

60
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,229
Hi Mom.

61
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,915
It is just the battery
phone.

62
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,917
No, I am eating dinner.

63
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,556
I did some steaks.

64
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,400
Why not talk about it
when I'm there?

65
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,311
Yes, I'll think.

66
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,111
Mom, I'm having dinner!

67
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,348
It's all right.

68
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,754
You too.

69
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Goodbye.

70
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,078
Get my pants?

71
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,509
Hi darling.

72
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,479
I was already sleeping?

73
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,314
Excuse me.
No, I'm on my way.

74
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,154
I do not know, in five minutes.

75
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,233
And me too.

76
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,070
It's all right.

77
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,719
You already see, okay?

78
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,150
Bye Bye.

79
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,236
Made peace?

80
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,710
And what did you tell him?

81
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,072
Oh, Raul ...

82
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,954
Well, it's like Grandma says,
'' There is no bastard without a jerk. ''

83
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,914
Oh, Raul!

84
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,795
For nothing here ...

85
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,478
Hey, you think that.

86
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,634
They did a park
amusement here at home.

87
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,070
Tomorrow I'll be there,
and buy walnut bread,

88
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,635
I'll get on a horse
carousel

89
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,916
I will be very happy.

90
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,473
Tell me you.

91
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,072
Okay, perfect.

92
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,316
Shall I come see you?

93
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,879
All right, whatever.

94
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,752
Yeah, I hope you here.

95
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,354
It's all right.

96
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,232
Sleep on the bus, right?

97
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,909
Little kisses!

98
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,395
How are you?

99
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,589
I'm fine and you?

100
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,671
I asked first.

101
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,469
How was it?

102
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,875
It went well.
Very tired.

103
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,468
Because?
8 hours by bus.

104
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,794
8 hours?

105
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,831
IT IS.
You are very good.

106
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,393
Inviting?

107
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,829
I am glad to see that
you are using the treadmill.

108
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,637
What Mom said?

109
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,909
Anything.

110
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,552
Call him later.
How is she?

111
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,955
With her boyfriend, as always.

112
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,036
And Grandma?

113
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,957
Still have that problem
in the eyes.

114
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,912
She will have to operate.

115
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,190
When?
At the end of the month.

116
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,630
I will see how I will be
work.

117
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,992
And how are you going
with Sofia?

118
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,353
Going ...

119
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,276
What will you do
on 14th birthday?

120
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,914
I think a movie
and then dinner.

121
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,629
Is that you?

122
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,628
Miguel is presenting me
her new boyfriend.

123
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,631
Are you ready?

124
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,631
I'm going to take a shower
and then we? - Let's go.

125
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,433
Do not put your feet
in my bed.

126
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,198
governments leave them on the street,

127
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,835
then they stop paying
health, education,

128
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,553
all utilities.

129
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,439
And as they have no money,
they have to sell.

130
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,074
So what's left?
The security.

131
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,078
It's the only thing the government
American worries.

132
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,352
And when security
It is their only political function

133
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,755
and their only source
legitimacy,

134
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,794
you have to make the
people feel in danger.

135
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,599
So people need
you and pay. Understood?

136
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,312
You do not feel
longing for Oaxaca?

137
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,431
It's a fucking bike racks.

138
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,039
I have many friends here.

139
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,272
I'm giving myself very well,
I am very happy.

140
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,119
Take care.

141
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,838
Go carefully.

142
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,316
Oso ... hi.

143
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,555
No for nothing.
What happened?

144
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,952
What happened?

145
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,719
But he told me,
I have the recording.

146
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,278
But who told you that?

147
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,198
And how do they know?

148
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,438
Which is,
how can it be a scam?

149
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,917
But you sent me
the contact,

150
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,680
you have chosen it as a
entrepreneurs of the year.

151
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,717
How would I know?

152
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,674
Yes, I better have checked.

153
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,355
But you're my editor.

154
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,717
And the way he spoke thought
it was a magazine of choice.

155
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,393
Well, okay.

156
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,199
Well, then do not publish.

157
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,470
They are already ready?

158
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,429
Excuse me.

159
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,150
I'm sorry, Oso.

160
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,271
How would I know
that would happen?

161
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,955
Excuse me...

162
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,669
Yes...

163
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,074
I get it.

164
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,913
But it's not fair to the reporter
scapegoated.

165
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,993
Until July?

166
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,595
Of course I have other work!
I'm Adolfo and ...

167
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,073
IT IS!

168
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,028
I get it.

169
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,869
It's ok.

170
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,799
I'll wait here.

171
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,279
Goodbye, Oso.

172
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,033
Wait a minute.

173
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,199
You come?

174
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,274
Why do men
always want to know that?

175
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,473
I my name is Arturo.

176
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,479
I know.

177
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,631
As you said
what was his name?

178
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,951
Why do you want to know?

179
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,632
Adolfo is Laura.

180
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,155
Lopez.

181
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,997
No, I'm in the magazine
Your Business with Oso.

182
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,519
Hello how are you?

183
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,311
We met in an Irish pub
about two months.

184
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,437
You are busy?

185
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,515
Okay, perfect.

186
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,359
Who is doing the summaries?

187
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,035
And I took a collaboratively and have
one free hour a week.

188
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,074
Okay, perfect.
I'll send you them right now.

189
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,834
And it okay if I call you
the second at 11am?

190
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,233
Okay, perfect.

191
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,112
You have the right number of Carlos,
the Latin Business magazine?

192
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,029
Okay, perfect.
Thank you, Arturo.

193
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,434
Adolfo, sorry.

194
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,240
So I'll call you
the second at 11am.

195
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,036
Thank you, bye.

196
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,399
Hello, ma'am, can I talk
Carlos Guerra, please?

197
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,348
I'm going!

198
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,673
It is green.

199
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,555
What?

200
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,719
I hurt you?

201
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,355
Do not.

202
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,509
Do you have whiskey?

203
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,550
Laura Lopez Martinez?

204
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,388
Meddler.

205
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,510
Long ago you
He came from Mexico?

206
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,148
And you like it?

207
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,916
I like this building.

208
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,390
Downstairs has an old couple
that seem to my parents.

209
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,437
I have dinner very often with them.

210
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,153
The front neighbor
It is my best friend.

211
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,189
Sometimes we go out
with her boyfriend.

212
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,358
On the day we met,
they had just left.

213
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,228
I take the kids
low at the fair

214
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,430
when their mother
Are you busy.

215
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,036
The building is not pretty,
but I feel ...

216
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,394
protected.

217
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,431
What do you know about me?

218
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,709
Anything.

219
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,478
Not if I ...
Do not.

220
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,198
Do you know what time is it?

221
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,879
I need to go.

222
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,634
AMAR ART

223
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,193
Shut up!

224
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,833
You crazy!

225
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,520
You're completely paranoid!

226
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,392
You crazy!

227
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,590
Go away,
goes away forever!

228
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,948
Bye!

229
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:51,830
Hello?

230
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,592
Hi what happened?

231
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,909
At where?

232
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,951
And what you
You are doing here?

233
00:47:02,145 --> 00:47:03,145
Ah yes.

234
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,831
It is the exposure
universities, right?

235
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,155
What is your name?
When you arrived?

236
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,393
Where are you?

237
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,632
Yeah, come here.

238
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,349
DO NOT COME TO HERE.

239
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,995
I HAVE A VISIT.

240
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,755
Where were you?
I here beating.

241
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,635
How are you?

242
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,069
I am fine.
Because I was drying her hair.

243
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,156
You women have no way ...

244
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,075
Who is it?

245
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,711
A friend.
I'll call her later.

246
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,117
After the exhibition we walk?

247
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,753
Where you want to go?

248
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,188
What time do you have that be there?
At 10am.

249
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,548
Let's go now.

250
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,989
Okay then.

251
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,432
Who were you with?

252
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,035
When?

253
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,151
The SMS you sent.
Do not be stupid!

254
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,074
With my brother.

255
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,436
You're a whore, a liar.

256
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,235
Thank you.

257
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,349
You're welcome.

258
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,439
I dislike.

259
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,438
Can I borrow?

260
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,953
An old rat

261
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,353
it was carpet

262
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,434
I was going to quit

263
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,153
He ended the burnt tail

264
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,679
She spent an ointment

265
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,557
and then tied a cloth

266
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,158
but the poor little mouse

267
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,630
He was without the tail

268
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,069
Tell me something
that no one knows about you.

269
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,835
I wanted to have a child.

270
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,917
It will be named Ariel.

271
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,150
And I will love it too.

272
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,913
And we'll both be
very happy together.

273
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,238
Far away from here.

274
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,352
My ass hurts.

275
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,672
Do not be a crybaby.

276
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,994
You know, I'll be an actor.

277
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,435
Oh yes?

278
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,918
At about one year
I did a commercial.

279
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,750
They never spent on TV,

280
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,757
but they paid me.

281
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,475
Wow.

282
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,430
And I also did a lot of testing.

283
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,080
You'll still talk to me
when famous?

284
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,753
Why marked
this day red?

285
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,629
You're welcome.

286
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,759
Let says.

287
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,996
On the 29th will do four years
my father died.

288
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,672
How many people died
on 29 February?

289
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,673
I do not know.

290
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,754
I suppose it's the only one.

291
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,479
Take the table.

292
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,119
Strip!

293
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,759
Close the eyes.

294
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,799
Lie belly up.

295
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,075
Masturbates.

296
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,635
Masturbates, motherfucker!

297
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,233
Close the eyes.

298
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,434
Want some quesadillas?

299
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,238
Do not.

300
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:35,909
If you want something else
I can go to the supermarket.

301
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,154
What do you feel being pissed?

302
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,639
Warmish.

303
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,237
Tell me more about you.

304
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,430
What you want to know?

305
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,869
When you lost
your virginity?

306
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,511
When I was 12 years old.

307
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,959
With whom?

308
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,032
It's none of your business.

309
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,636
What do you want to do with me?

310
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,955
The other.

311
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,309
Hi, Oso.

312
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,191
A little bit, but tell.

313
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,152
Thank you, Oso,
but ... you have a problem.

314
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,237
I'm leaving the country.

315
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,632
No, to live.

316
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,393
In Switzerland.

317
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,116
I will work at the embassy.

318
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,230
It is expensive in Mexico.

319
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,868
Thanks.

320
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,593
After tomorrow.

321
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:03,592
Yeah, I'm packing
everything like crazy.

322
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,320
It is my mother
He has a friend who is a diplomat.

323
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,119
Okay, perfect.

324
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:18,030
Yes of course,
we are in touch by email.

325
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:22,392
Yes, I send a postcard
when I get there.

326
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,239
Of course yes.

327
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,751
Come on, go to your meeting.

328
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,749
Thanks.

329
01:07:33,567 --> 01:07:34,567
Goodbye.

330
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,791
Why do not you cut me?

331
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,829
Would you like to cut my
throat while eating me?

332
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,156
Come inside me,

333
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,710
while watching me dying?

334
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,554
You start cutting
my breasts.

335
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:39,393
Can you imagine the blood coming out?

336
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,399
You spread throughout
my body.

337
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,438
Then you mete me ...

338
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,356
and while eating me ...

339
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,629
I'll be looking
in your eyes.

340
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,469
You can make a hole here ...

341
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,278
and yet another here.

342
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:22,148
And so I bleed
until death.

343
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,752
But I can keep talking
with you all the time.

344
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:50,437
And like anyway
I am dying,

345
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,949
you can beat me.

346
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,354
It cuts.

347
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,673
Burns me.

348
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,360
You can do
whatever you want to me.

349
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,835
Meanwhile I will
looking in your eyes,

350
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,235
and saying I love you.

351
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:14,393
And when I can not
more move,

352
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,591
and is very weak ...

353
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,197
and is dead ...

354
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,074
you can enjoy
within my body.

355
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,478
Would you kill me?

356
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,078
Do not worry.

357
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,475
No one would realize.

358
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,515
Nobody knows you
know me.

359
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:13,558
I can leave clothes
clean in the dining room.

360
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,276
And a bag for you
take dirty clothes.

361
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:28,115
You can use gloves
not to leave fingerprints.

362
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,997
And I give you the number
the nearby phone,

363
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:36,429
for he finds
my body.

364
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,269
You can come tomorrow at 22h?

365
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,352
Please?

366
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,158
What are you doing here?

367
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,838
What happened?

368
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:48,834
Come here.

369
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,193
She broke up with me.

370
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,393
It's all right.

371
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:07,510
She said I'm
taking very seriously.

372
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,839
She did not allow
I did not explain myself.

373
01:19:14,447 --> 01:19:15,447
It's all right.

374
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,595
All right, Raul, okay ...

375
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:21,680
It's all right.

376
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:23,874
Come here.

377
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:35,959
Do not Cry.

378
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,673
Calm down.

379
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,595
You will meet more girls.

380
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:53,232
You will meet many people
who will love you.

381
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,634
You will always have
each other.

382
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,391
You're my little brother.

383
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,391
And I'm your little sister.

384
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:30,392
It's the daddy?

385
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,679
IT IS.

386
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,518
When you picked up?

387
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:44,192
The last time I went to Oaxaca.

388
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,788
Mom never said, is not it?

389
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,591
You know what today is?

390
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:13,517
When I was little ...

391
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:20,559
I thought that my father
was is best person in the world.

392
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,438
She was a good person.

393
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,357
Everything will be fine.

394
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,592
Everything will be fine.

395
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,878
He did not come.
