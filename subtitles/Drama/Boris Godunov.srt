1
00:00:16,607 --> 00:00:20,332
Boris Godunov

2
00:02:20,217 --> 00:02:22,574
It was the year 1598.

3
00:02:22,774 --> 00:02:30,476
No lawful heir remained
after the death of Tsar Feodor, son of Ivan the Terrible.

4
00:02:30,676 --> 00:02:39,609
The road to power lay open to Boris Godunov,
the late Tsar's brother-in-law.
Yet, Godunov was slow in accepting the crown.

5
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:46,825
The people were made to plead with Boris
to accept the throne.

6
00:03:42,117 --> 00:03:46,607
You loafers - have you turned to wooden statues?

7
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:50,597
Down there - on your knees!

8
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:55,109
Faster! Go down!

9
00:03:57,255 --> 00:04:00,160
You're the devil's sons and daughters!

10
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:11,271
Lord in Heaven, do not reject us, oh Father.

11
00:04:12,178 --> 00:04:23,004
Lord, we beseech You that You protect us, o Father.

12
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:32,819
We are all orphans without You - help Your children. Lord!

13
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:49,678
And with tears we ask You, Lord in Heaven:
hear our wailing—hear our bitter cries.

14
00:04:50,595 --> 00:05:01,048
Help, Father—Lord in the skies above.
Oh Father, Benefactor, don't leave us - Help, Father!

15
00:05:02,897 --> 00:05:13,003
Help, Father—Lord in the skies above.
Oh Father, Benefactor, don't leave us - Help, Father!

16
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:29,775
Mityukh—say, Mityukh: why do we cry?

17
00:05:29,975 --> 00:05:32,124
Brother—I can't tell you.

18
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:35,948
We must find a Tsar to govern Russia.

19
00:05:36,148 --> 00:05:45,910
To hell with it! I'm hoarse from shouting.
I ask you, my darling dove—have you a drop of water?

20
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:52,202
Wait—I'll serve you in a moment.
Just do not shout so much, so you won't be so thirsty.

21
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:56,802
- Women, stop your silly chatter. Quiet!
- And who are you to tell us?

22
00:05:57,628 --> 00:05:59,972
Don't think that you can bully us!

23
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:05,204
Oh, you witches, keep your mouths shut!

24
00:06:05,304 --> 00:06:15,140
Listen to that little devil.
He's a fool—he's only boasting.
He's a heathen—he'll be roasting.
God have mercy on this sinner.
Let us run and look for shelter.

25
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:29,519
What's this? so silent? you spare your voices -

26
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,646
I'll show you!

27
00:06:31,646 --> 00:06:38,711
- Don't be mad, Nikitich; don't be mad, beloved.
- Let us do some breathing—then we'll do some praying.

28
00:06:38,911 --> 00:06:44,651
He won't let us breathe, the bastard.

29
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:49,576
Shut up—use your voices as you're told.

30
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,488
- All right.
- Well?

31
00:06:54,582 --> 00:07:02,728
Lord in Heaven, do not reject us, o Father.

32
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:13,422
Lord, we beseech You that You protect us, o Father.

33
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:29,939
We are lost without You.
Lord in Heaven:
hear our wailing—hear our bitter cries.

34
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:58,745
Help, Father!—Lord in the skies above:
o Father, o father in Heaven, o Father. . .ah. .

35
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:13,720
Quiet—and listen.
Hear what the Duma councillor has to say.

36
00:08:35,566 --> 00:08:46,043
Hear me, citizens of Moscow.
The Boyar has not relented.

37
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:58,039
He pays no heed to the Boyars of the Duma or the Patriarchs.

38
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:09,088
He does not want to hear of his accession.

39
00:09:09,288 --> 00:09:26,494
Woe to Russia, woe to us, the Russian people.

40
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:36,995
Our land groans, in lawlessness.

41
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:46,279
Let us pray to the Lord in His mercy

42
00:09:46,479 --> 00:10:02,833
that He may comfort our troubled Russia by His divine consolation,

43
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:25,991
and grant His guidance to Boris' weary soul.

44
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:18,846
Long may he live.
Tsar Boris Feodorovich.

45
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:26,081
Long life and glory- Our Tsar and Father.

46
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:28,179
Praise him!

47
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:39,746
As the sun is to Heaven, its highest glory,
glory to this country, to Russia.

48
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:47,474
Tsar Boris is glory, glory.
Long life and glory
Long life and glory. . . .

49
00:11:51,886 --> 00:11:55,407
Hail to Tsar Boris.

50
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:14,547
Long live Tsar Boris.
Long life and glory. Be happy, friends.
Jubilate, and be happy, friends.
Let us praise our Tsar, Boris Godunov.

51
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:24,781
Long life to him! Tsar Boris Feodorovich.
Long may he live.

52
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:34,994
Long life to him! Tsar Boris Feodorovich.

53
00:12:34,994 --> 00:12:36,150
Long may he live.

54
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:48,517
To the mightiest of Tsars, Boris,
be glory—glory—glory—glory!

55
00:12:49,756 --> 00:13:00,819
glory—glory—glory—glory!

56
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:31,306
My soul is sad -

57
00:13:35,027 --> 00:14:00,649
a strange and fearful omen
invades all my being with its dark foreboding.

58
00:14:02,219 --> 00:14:15,551
My Lord and God — You, my Eternal Father,

59
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:32,824
from Heaven's throne in mercy look on us,

60
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:49,673
and send to me, and to the power of my reign, Your holy blessing.

61
00:14:51,813 --> 00:15:18,315
Let me be kind and merciful like You,
let me bring glory to the Throne.

62
00:15:25,414 --> 00:15:34,019
And now we bend our knees
before the mighty Tsars who governed Russia.

63
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:40,700
And then I'll invite all the people to a feast!

64
00:15:42,774 --> 00:16:01,980
All - from Boyar down to the lowly poor,
all be my guests, all will be dearly welcome.

65
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:12,001
Glory—glory—glory. Long life and glory
Our Tsar and Father—long may he reign, the mighty ruler!

66
00:16:13,925 --> 00:16:23,438
As to Heaven the sun is its glory, glory.
so to Russia her great Tsar Boris is glory.

67
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:36,262
Glory—and long may he reign.
GLORY GLORY!

68
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:41,279
GLORY GLORY!

69
00:16:44,117 --> 00:16:48,671
GLORY GLORY!

70
00:17:26,469 --> 00:17:34,334
Just one more page, the last of all my stories,

71
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:42,100
and this will end the chronicle I wrote.

72
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:56,929
The work is done, entrusted to this sinner by God, the Lord.

73
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:16,428
And not in vain have I been called for many years to be a witness:

74
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:34,548
there'll come a day, a monk will read these papers,
and he will reap the fruits of all my toiling.

75
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:57,194
Then he will light, like me, his lamp at midnight,
and shake the dust of all too many years
to tell again the legends of the fathers.

76
00:18:58,194 --> 00:19:14,254
And thus the true believers will remember
all that befell our homeland in long forgotten times.

77
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:34,528
The dawn of day is near -

78
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:44,089
my lamp is but a flicker -

79
00:19:51,443 --> 00:20:02,659
Just one more page, the last of all my stories. . .

80
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:17,501
Lord in Heaven, Father, have mercy on Your slaves!
Merciful God.

81
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:27,816
From the flock of true believers
turn away all evil thoughts, merciful God!

82
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:34,664
That dream again!

83
00:20:34,864 --> 00:20:41,112
The third time I dreamt that dream!

84
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:53,062
How it haunts me, that cursed dream.

85
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,497
Awake so soon, brother?

86
00:21:02,485 --> 00:21:12,316
I beg you: give me your blessing, worthy father.

87
00:21:12,747 --> 00:21:33,936
May God the Lord protect you, son -
today, and always, and forever!

88
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:43,659
All through the night you never ceased your writing.

89
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:52,651
I was asleep—and yet I am not rested:
an evil dream has stirred my tortured heart.

90
00:21:52,651 --> 00:22:03,095
I mounted on a mighty stairway
that led me to a tower
and I saw all Moscow from on high.

91
00:22:04,045 --> 00:22:14,488
Like in an ant-heap the crowds below were running to and fro.
At me they laughed, and pointed with their fingers.

92
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:19,556
It frightened me, and I began to tremble . . .

93
00:22:19,996 --> 00:22:25,610
I tumbled down the stairs,

94
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:31,841
and I awakened.

95
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:54,880
But now, I want to ask a question that is on my mind:
Who killed young Dimitri, our Tsarevich?

96
00:22:56,229 --> 00:23:03,550
You, I am told, were present that frightful day in Uglich?

97
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:14,084
Yes, I was. Our Lord and God had destined me
to see and witness

98
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:20,822
the heinous crime.

99
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:28,296
I came at night.

100
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:40,905
Next morning dawn awoke me.

101
00:23:43,244 --> 00:23:50,428
there was a noise, the sound of tolling bells,

102
00:23:51,161 --> 00:23:56,110
- screams - shouts,
we all ran to the palace -

103
00:23:58,335 --> 00:24:02,306
What a sight we saw!

104
00:24:05,134 --> 00:24:12,838
A sea of blood, and in it the Tsarevich . . .

105
00:24:13,283 --> 00:24:21,465
this mother the Tsaritsa unconscious by his side.

106
00:24:22,914 --> 00:24:31,304
His faithful nurse was crazed with fear,
and sobbed in desperation.

107
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:36,320
And then, quite suddenly,

108
00:24:38,161 --> 00:24:49,684
the crowd cried out in wrath
and dragged in the servant who betrayed her helpless master.
"Confess the deed," the crowd shouted.

109
00:24:49,820 --> 00:25:04,611
The murderers, in fear of death,
admitted they killed the boy by order of Boris.

110
00:25:05,534 --> 00:25:18,842
He would be as old as you are—and Tsar today!

111
00:25:22,674 --> 00:25:26,678
But God did not allow it,

112
00:25:27,446 --> 00:25:40,151
and thus the crime that Tsar Boris committed
will conclude the chronicle I write.

113
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:59,877
Brother Grigori, by learning you have formed an eager mind:
to you I want to leave my work;

114
00:26:11,093 --> 00:26:16,506
This is the matin bell.

115
00:26:21,945 --> 00:26:32,552
Do give your blessing, Lord, to all Your slaves.
I need my stick, Grigori.

116
00:26:36,989 --> 00:26:46,191
Lord, have mercy on us, have mercy, God, on us all!

117
00:26:48,623 --> 00:27:05,053
Lord, have mercy on us, have mercy, God, on us all!

118
00:27:06,715 --> 00:27:31,733
Heavenly, mighty Father—ever just, eternal, have mercy. Lord!

119
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:41,316
Boris, Boris, you make the country tremble,

120
00:27:41,316 --> 00:27:50,942
and no one ever dares remember
the fate you meted out to the Tsarevich.

121
00:27:59,864 --> 00:28:15,125
Yet in this quiet cell
a monk recorded all that he knew
of this most heinous murder.

122
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:31,166
You will be called before your earthly judges,
nor can you flee the judgment of the Lord.

123
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:21,419
In a pond quite near lives a gander here,
oh—you my gander, dear! my beloved gander, dear!

124
00:29:21,619 --> 00:29:31,537
Now you must stay here, lovely gander, dear.
Likes to swim in every pond, of the willows he is fond.

125
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:40,553
Fold your little wings, darling gander mine!
Don't fly away from me, stay and keep me company.

126
00:29:40,753 --> 00:29:44,144
You will be my love like a turtle dove,
and this love will have no end ...

127
00:29:44,144 --> 00:30:02,379
Brothers and Christians, friends and honest people,
for the church we're building we ask you for a modest gift.
Bread on the waters—you'll be rewarded!

128
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:04,945
Wandering monks they are—two worthy pilgrims.

129
00:30:06,845 --> 00:30:12,504
The Lord may bless this house of yours!

130
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:18,944
Would you like to eat something, reverend fathers?

131
00:30:19,144 --> 00:30:23,617
We take whatever God may send, mistress.

132
00:30:26,365 --> 00:30:28,158
No wine today?

133
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:33,082
Why, of course, father!

134
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:36,618
I'll bring you some,
have a seat.

135
00:30:46,593 --> 00:30:50,104
What are you so glum about, companion?

136
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:59,687
Here we are close to the border now: Lithuania!
And that's where you asked us to take you.

137
00:31:05,603 --> 00:31:11,666
I'll never really be safe till I'm over the border!

138
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:18,052
And what's so good about Lithuania?

139
00:31:18,052 --> 00:31:24,778
Take us—: my friend Missail, and I, wicked sinner:

140
00:31:24,978 --> 00:31:30,654
since we escaped from the cloister walls,
we don't care a single rap what country we're in -

141
00:31:30,854 --> 00:31:37,412
Lithuania, Russia - what do we care?

142
00:31:37,412 --> 00:31:42,230
It's all the same to us
if there's some wine!

143
00:31:45,928 --> 00:31:48,763
Ah, there is some now.

144
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:56,075
Near Kazan—near the famous olden fortress

145
00:31:58,344 --> 00:32:01,887
sat Tsar Ivan—making merry at a banquet.

146
00:32:03,813 --> 00:32:13,350
Tartars got from him no pity
they were told to leave the city,
and not to come again to Russia!

147
00:32:18,376 --> 00:32:25,576
But one day the Tsar had enough, and in the dark of the night
asked his men to put a lot of mines all over the town.

148
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:31,819
But the Tartars kept on acting like the owners of the place,
when they saw Ivan, they simply laughed right in his face.

149
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:35,425
That's the way the Tartars are!

150
00:32:37,368 --> 00:32:47,407
And the Terrible Tsar was sad by day and night,
hung his head to the left, but later also to the right.

151
00:32:47,607 --> 00:32:57,076
Then he called for all his cannoneers,
and he ordered them to be prepared —
every one of them.

152
00:33:00,207 --> 00:33:11,735
As the fuses began to smolder merrily,
one young man threw a light into a powder keg,

153
00:33:11,935 --> 00:33:21,164
they exploded every single mine that could be found. Hey!
One could hear the blast for miles around - what a noise it was!

154
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:34,489
That's how it went in Kazan, the famous city!

155
00:33:44,697 --> 00:33:51,921
Tell me: don't you drink anything?
And it seems you don't even sing?

156
00:33:53,787 --> 00:33:55,528
I don't drink.

157
00:33:55,728 --> 00:33:58,886
Each to his own taste!

158
00:33:59,086 --> 00:34:06,280
. . . and mine is for wine! Come on, Missail,
let us drink a toast to our charming host. . .

159
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,917
Now listen, brother:

160
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:22,771
I do not care for those that don't like wine!

161
00:34:22,971 --> 00:34:29,246
Drinking may be piggish.
soberness is priggish!

162
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,419
Phew!

163
00:34:36,303 --> 00:34:41,643
There was a man,

164
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:48,065
a darling man,

165
00:34:49,724 --> 00:34:58,956
spurred his horse so it ran.

166
00:35:03,508 --> 00:35:06,498
He wore a cap ...

167
00:35:06,698 --> 00:35:11,130
Please tell me: this road out there,
where does it lead to?

168
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,710
... he did not care a rap

169
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,531
Into Lithuania.

170
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:22,256
... he was filthy, that chap!
- Is the border very far?

171
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:25,402
No, it isn't.

172
00:35:25,602 --> 00:35:34,625
if you hurry you can still get there tonight
- if they do not stop you

173
00:35:34,825 --> 00:35:37,258
Me? Why should they?

174
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:44,658
Somebody must have escaped from Moscow,
police have been ordered everywhere to look out for him!

175
00:35:44,858 --> 00:35:49,058
Eh! this does not seem to be my lucky day!

176
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:54,205
Do they always get them?
No—they don't!

177
00:35:54,405 --> 00:36:05,004
It might be desperate, if there were no other road
than just the high road, but let me tell you:

178
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:16,023
If you cross the main street, you'll find a foot-path
— keep on walking—you'll come to a chapel, near by a brook. . . .

179
00:36:16,223 --> 00:36:26,019
and from there to Khlopino—and then to Zaitsero
—From there on you cannot miss it: you are almost at the border.

180
00:36:27,243 --> 00:36:39,610
Police are everywhere—: therefore be careful!
They are out to fleece us, and rob us of our last copeck!

181
00:36:42,676 --> 00:36:51,300
Came to a door - he made: knock—knock

182
00:36:52,494 --> 00:36:59,368
and then he knocked again: knock- knock—knock.

183
00:36:59,568 --> 00:37:02,074
Who is it now?

184
00:37:06,232 --> 00:37:10,450
Them again! Oh, darn it all!

185
00:37:11,784 --> 00:37:25,622
There was a man ... a darling man . . .
spurred his horse so it ...

186
00:37:25,822 --> 00:37:27,775
Who are these two men?

187
00:37:27,975 --> 00:37:34,382
We are two lay brothers—
we are poor and honest,

188
00:37:34,582 --> 00:37:40,412
wandering through the villages,
begging for a copeck, or two!

189
00:37:40,612 --> 00:37:42,075
And you—who are you?

190
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:45,082
Our companion.

191
00:37:51,064 --> 00:37:53,754
A peace-loving friend of the law!

192
00:37:53,954 --> 00:38:00,415
I have come with these worthy old men,
I'm on my way home now.

193
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:14,052
Try to get milk from a stone!
That case is hopeless.

194
00:38:15,407 --> 00:38:19,635
Let's try the old ones.

195
00:38:19,835 --> 00:38:22,702
Lord above—have mercy on us sinners!

196
00:38:27,981 --> 00:38:33,952
How is everything? tell me:
how are they treating you?

197
00:38:33,952 --> 00:38:35,886
I'll tell you.

198
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:40,922
Alyokha: have you got that sheet?

199
00:38:41,122 --> 00:38:44,374
Let's have a look. Listen—

200
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:52,062
From his cell in Moscow escaped some unworthy monk:
Grishka Otrepyev

201
00:38:52,262 --> 00:38:56,321
Have you heard about it?

202
00:38:56,521 --> 00:38:59,046
No—never.

203
00:38:59,246 --> 00:39:07,750
Well, the Tsar has ordered us to find that heretic,
to arrest him and hang him!

204
00:39:09,344 --> 00:39:12,532
I'm sure you have heard that?

205
00:39:12,732 --> 00:39:15,102
I have not!

206
00:39:15,302 --> 00:39:18,587
Are you a reader?

207
00:39:18,787 --> 00:39:25,258
No—sorry. I was not meant to be.

208
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:31,015
Come, have a look at this.

209
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,236
Yes—I can read.

210
00:39:37,436 --> 00:39:43,948
Take this. Hurry up. Read aloud!

211
00:39:48,988 --> 00:39:56,422
"Be it known to every one:
that a heretic, named Grigori Otrepyev,
has run away from a Moscow monastery.

212
00:39:56,622 --> 00:40:08,592
After he listened to the Evil One, he set out
to tempt his brethren with visions of sin.

213
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:18,409
Now that Grishka may be trying to reach Lithuania.
The Tsar orders you to arrest this man . .

214
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:20,740
"... and to hang him!"

215
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:25,651
It says nothing here of hanging.

216
00:40:25,851 --> 00:40:29,721
Fool! You ought to learn to read between the lines. . . .

217
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:37,184
Again: ". . . to arrest and to hang him."

218
00:40:37,384 --> 00:40:42,712
". . . and to hang him."

219
00:40:42,912 --> 00:40:47,887
As for his age
. . . Grishka is . . .

220
00:40:48,087 --> 00:40:55,579
He's about fifty two. , . .
. . . has a rather red nose . . .
is of medium height, but heavy. .

221
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:59,056
That's him all right: let's catch him,
children!

222
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:06,807
Hands off! I warn you—don't lay hands,
you picked the wrong man. . . .

223
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:11,384
Who says I am Grishka?

224
00:41:11,584 --> 00:41:14,881
No, friends—: I don't care for such jokes!

225
00:41:15,535 --> 00:41:25,044
My reading may be halting—I don't say it is fluent ...
but I can try—let me try

226
00:41:25,044 --> 00:41:31,000
it seems my life may hang on my reading.

227
00:41:41,172 --> 00:41:56,573
. . . his age . . . age ... his age is twen. . . twenty!"

228
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:02,179
Who says "fifty-two"? Liar!

229
00:42:03,058 --> 00:42:09,468
"Of medium height ... he has reddish hair . . .

230
00:42:10,346 --> 00:42:19,027
and on his nose there is . . .
on his nose there is one little wart. . . .

231
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:32,589
Furthermore—one of his arms . . .
his arms ... is shorter ... one of his arms is ..."

232
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:39,776
I think it might be. . . .

233
00:42:42,633 --> 00:42:49,403
It's him. Don't let him get away!
- Get hold of him!

234
00:43:17,212 --> 00:43:24,843
Where are you, love of mine?
You, for whom I'm longing.

235
00:43:24,843 --> 00:43:32,419
Resting under the green-sward,
far from all who love you,

236
00:43:32,419 --> 00:43:40,647
you must be so lonely,
there under your tomb-stone.

237
00:43:40,647 --> 00:43:47,375
You don't see my sorrow.
You don't hear my crying.

238
00:43:47,375 --> 00:44:00,398
Why did you leave me?
Like you I am lonely.

239
00:44:00,731 --> 00:44:02,049
Good Heavens!

240
00:44:04,948 --> 00:44:14,410
What's this? What wolf has stirred
the hen amidst her brood?

241
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:21,969
Mightiest Tsar, forgive me:
but I am old, and everything upsets me.

242
00:44:22,169 --> 00:44:32,378
My Xenia,
my much beloved daughter!

243
00:44:32,578 --> 00:44:46,972
You shed a widow's tears before your wedding,—
for he who was betrothed to you is dead.

244
00:44:47,172 --> 00:44:55,812
Father and Tsar,
please do not heed
the tears that I am shedding,

245
00:44:56,012 --> 00:45:09,697
for all my grief must seem so unimportant
compared to your afflictions.

246
00:45:09,697 --> 00:45:18,086
And you, my son, my Fyodor
What is this?

247
00:45:18,286 --> 00:45:29,598
This is a map of Russia, of our country
from East to West.

248
00:45:29,798 --> 00:45:35,604
All this is beautiful, my son.

249
00:45:35,804 --> 00:45:55,826
As from the clouds you see our country,
this great and mighty realm before you:
the borders, rivers—cities.

250
00:45:56,026 --> 00:46:06,216
Go on, and study, Fyodor!

251
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:29,451
The time will come, perhaps it will be soon,
when you will be the Tsar of this holy land.

252
00:46:29,651 --> 00:46:36,589
Good-by—my son.

253
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:58,772
Mine is the highest power!

254
00:46:58,972 --> 00:47:08,120
In its sixth year my reign is calm and peaceful.

255
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:24,679
And yet my heart
has never known a moment's peace.

256
00:47:29,149 --> 00:47:41,516
How often have I heard it prophesied:
my power and my glory would be endless!

257
00:47:42,713 --> 00:48:03,321
But life, and fame, the heady wine of power,
the people's applause,
all that has lost its lure.

258
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:23,644
How heavy lies on me the hand of the Lord!
And every sinful soul must fear His verdict.

259
00:48:23,644 --> 00:48:40,677
There is darkness all around,
in vain I strive to flee from it.

260
00:48:42,957 --> 00:48:54,402
Oh, for a ray of hope to guide me!
My weary heart is aching with longing,

261
00:48:54,602 --> 00:49:01,562
it cries to God for mercy.
At times I hear around me a secret whisper ...

262
00:49:06,853 --> 00:49:18,897
I am betrayed, the Boyars hate me,
open revolt is rife in Lithuania,
hungry crowds and plague and devastation!

263
00:49:18,897 --> 00:49:34,392
Like an angry beast on the prowl
are the people, in hunger and poverty,
Russia moans.

264
00:49:35,178 --> 00:49:52,472
For all the sorrows that Heaven has sent us,
to punish the sins we committed, they blame the Tsar!

265
00:49:52,472 --> 00:50:07,971
For all their misfortunes they curse my very name,
curse and despise Boris!

266
00:50:11,087 --> 00:50:23,801
I cannot sleep at night, and yet I have night-mares!
The child appears to me, its bloody head,

267
00:50:24,001 --> 00:50:30,632
eyes red with crying, begging and pleading,
pleading for mercy.

268
00:50:30,832 --> 00:50:34,739
But there was no mercy.

269
00:50:34,939 --> 00:50:46,202
Gaping the wound in its body,
piercing the shriek, it cried in dying.

270
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:57,793
Oh—Lord above!
God!

271
00:50:59,695 --> 00:51:01,540
Ah, shush!

272
00:50:56,999 --> 00:51:02,871
What has happened?

273
00:51:02,871 --> 00:51:05,887
Ah—shush—shush! Quiet!

274
00:51:06,087 --> 00:51:09,610
Find out what's going on there!

275
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:13,538
- Shush—shush—shush
- Well—what now?

276
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:17,398
- Shush—shush—shush

277
00:51:17,598 --> 00:51:19,386
Ah— how they yell!

278
00:51:21,613 --> 00:51:24,218
Well—speak up!

279
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:26,826
Speak!

280
00:51:28,268 --> 00:51:39,077
Almighty Lord and Tsar,
Prince Vassily Shuiski is asking to be received.

281
00:51:39,277 --> 00:51:44,281
Shuiski? He's here?

282
00:51:44,281 --> 00:51:53,198
Tell him We shall be glad to see him,
to listen to his message!

283
00:51:54,746 --> 00:52:02,406
Last night one of Pushkin's servants came to tell us
that Shuiski and Mstislavski, and some others,

284
00:52:02,606 --> 00:52:08,497
and even Pushkin, held a meeting in the middle of the night:
a man, it seems, arrived from Cracow, to report. . .

285
00:52:08,697 --> 00:52:10,786
Arrest that man!

286
00:52:14,221 --> 00:52:20,115
Aha, Prince Shuiski.

287
00:52:23,478 --> 00:52:29,594
Almighty Tsar and Lord,
I greet you!

288
00:52:31,862 --> 00:52:35,513
Oh! it's you, my worthy Prince!

289
00:52:35,713 --> 00:52:44,032
the man who's proud to lead the brainless masses,
a master in the noble art of treason

290
00:52:44,232 --> 00:52:48,855
You—the evil spirit of the throne.

291
00:52:49,727 --> 00:52:54,671
Every oath that you swore you've broken threefold

292
00:52:53,671 --> 00:53:03,269
cunning hypocrite—wheedling flatterer,
a traitor disguised as a Boyar.
Deceiver! Snake!

293
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:16,200
When Ivan ruled Russia,
Shuiski was a name
that used to be received with honors!

294
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:26,301
Is this perhaps the news that you and Pushkin heard
when you received a message from all your Boyar friends
that I have banished.

295
00:53:26,501 --> 00:53:40,818
Yes, Sire.
The rumor speaks of a usurper;
the Poles—the Pope, they all are on his side!

296
00:53:42,671 --> 00:53:47,212
But—who is the man?

297
00:53:47,212 --> 00:53:51,343
Whose name has he usurped, the scoundrel ?

298
00:53:51,664 --> 00:54:00,116
Yes—first I want to know his name! You know it?

299
00:54:00,434 --> 00:54:06,388
Believe me, Tsar: your power is tremendous.

300
00:54:06,388 --> 00:54:22,077
Your charity, your kindness, and your bounty
have won the love of every humble slave,
and they have vowed their faith to you and to your throne.

301
00:54:22,077 --> 00:54:35,676
Yet, I must warn the Tsar, my master and my Lord,
although with sorrow and with grief my heart is bleeding,
you must be told that this may happen:

302
00:54:35,876 --> 00:54:49,291
if he should drive so far his criminal intentions
to enter Russia and to march on us,
and if he tries to captivate the crowds,

303
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:57,912
- Dimitri's name may be a mighty weapon!
- Dimitri? Tsarevich, leave us!

304
00:54:58,112 --> 00:55:03,076
Please Sire, me stay and let me hear ...

305
00:55:03,076 --> 00:55:07,179
No—no, you must not stay! You heard me

306
00:55:07,379 --> 00:55:14,544
Tsarevich, leave us!

307
00:55:16,281 --> 00:55:28,150
Take measures, don't delay:
have soldiers guard all Lithuanian frontiers at once,
that not a single soul can enter Russia any more!

308
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,613
That's all.

309
00:55:30,813 --> 00:55:39,215
No! stay here, stay here, Shuiski.

310
00:55:42,694 --> 00:55:54,498
I ask you: have you ever heard
that children who are dead, return from where they slumber,

311
00:55:56,222 --> 00:56:11,385
to prosecute the Tsar, the Tsar,
the ruler, elected by the people,
and crowned in solemn ritual by the Patriarch?

312
00:56:18,478 --> 00:56:22,261
What?

313
00:56:23,741 --> 00:56:26,542
You laugh?

314
00:56:26,742 --> 00:56:30,891
Why don't you laugh, then?

315
00:56:31,091 --> 00:56:37,272
Forgive me.
Almighty Tsar and Lord.

316
00:56:37,472 --> 00:56:41,541
Tell me, Prince:

317
00:56:41,741 --> 00:57:03,385
That day in Uglich, where the murder was committed,
and when Dimitri, the Tsarevich, was killed,
are you quite sure the victim was Dimitri?

318
00:57:03,585 --> 00:57:07,474
- Quite.
- Vasili Ivanich!

319
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:19,739
By all that you hold holy,
I beseech you, be frank with me.

320
00:57:19,939 --> 00:57:31,157
Truth is all I want!
I shall be magnanimous: the past is past,
and even your betrayal I can forget.

321
00:57:31,357 --> 00:57:47,514
But if you cheat me now, and lie to me,
I shall devise a punishment so devilish
that Tsar Ivan himself would tremble in his grave with horror.

322
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:51,160
Now answer me!

323
00:57:51,360 --> 00:58:04,060
You speak of punishment to scare me,
no death I fear, I only fear your displeasure!

324
00:58:07,256 --> 00:58:25,469
Everyone in Uglich had seen the body:
five days and nights it lay outside the old cathedral,

325
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:39,248
and with the child another thirteen corpses,
disfigured terribly, in rags, and blood-bespattered.

326
00:58:39,448 --> 00:58:55,562
One could see how all of them
had slowly started rotting.

327
00:58:57,607 --> 00:59:09,177
But then I saw Dimitri's face
was peaceful, pure, and radiant.

328
00:59:09,377 --> 00:59:31,157
But bloody red, frightfully, his wound was gaping,
yet on his lips, so chaste and so guileless,
a child's contented smile was playing.

329
00:59:31,357 --> 00:59:48,859
He looked as if he were asleep and dreaming a happy dream,
and in his right hand he clutched a little toy,
as though defending it.

330
00:59:49,059 --> 00:59:50,410
Enough!

331
01:00:10,091 --> 01:00:14,602
Ah!—for some air!

332
01:00:15,634 --> 01:00:20,705
I'm suffocating here.

333
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:39,428
I feel how all my blood is rushing to my head,
it's raging in my temples.

334
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:56,977
Oh guilty conscience,
how cruelly you punish!

335
01:01:07,492 --> 01:01:30,137
If you did but once in life an evil deed,
and though it was your fate that made you do it,
your soul is doomed, your heart is drowned in poison,

336
01:01:30,137 --> 01:01:43,247
it'll be hard, hard, one becomes oppressed,
like hammer blows pounding in your ears,
the thunder of damnation.

337
01:01:43,247 --> 01:01:48,746
Something smothers and chokes you ...

338
01:01:48,946 --> 01:01:51,775
My head is spinning.

339
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:58,444
before my eyes . . . the child ...
I see it lying there in its blood . .

340
01:02:01,764 --> 01:02:05,200
There ... there ...

341
01:02:06,279 --> 01:02:08,487
what is it?

342
01:02:07,487 --> 01:02:10,732
there in the corner

343
01:02:12,584 --> 01:02:21,395
It threatens me . . .
it grows . . . closes in
it moans and trembles . .

344
01:02:21,595 --> 01:02:25,196
Away! Away!

345
01:02:25,396 --> 01:02:30,487
not I ... I did not ... murder you

346
01:02:30,687 --> 01:02:35,592
away ... away, my child

347
01:02:35,792 --> 01:02:41,575
it was not I,
it was the people! away, my child

348
01:02:41,775 --> 01:02:43,802
away!

349
01:02:45,787 --> 01:02:47,149
away!

350
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:05,743
Oh Lord!

351
01:03:05,943 --> 01:03:15,762
You wouldn't want the death of a sinner.

352
01:03:17,565 --> 01:03:42,853
Have mercy on the soul of a criminal, Tsar Boris.

353
01:04:08,481 --> 01:04:25,940
Do not speak to me of love and passion,
all your solemn oaths, I fear, will not convince me.
Yes, my friend, your case is hopeless.

354
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:36,242
Moscow's haughty power will yet yield to Poland.
And her mighty soldiers, they will rot in prison.
And Boris, their ruler, we will beat forever!

355
01:04:36,242 --> 01:04:47,430
Yes, it sounds enchanting, but why don't you do it?
Show the Russians: you're the stronger.
And Boris is Tsar no longer!

356
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:59,354
For Poland's greater glory first we must destroy
the might of Moscow!

357
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:09,376
Marina cannot help us: her beauty is too cold
she's haughty—proud . . .

358
01:05:09,576 --> 01:05:12,299
And now—let's drink, my friends!

359
01:05:12,499 --> 01:05:19,434
To the health of the Mnishneks.
And here's to you, Marina!

360
01:05:20,669 --> 01:05:27,863
Drink with us to fame and beauty!
A glass of wine to toast Marina!
The crown of Tsars will yet adorn Marina!

361
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:32,297
Vivat! vivat!

362
01:05:47,461 --> 01:05:53,136
Dimitri! Tsarevich! Dimitri!

363
01:05:55,507 --> 01:05:59,577
It's you—Marina!

364
01:05:59,777 --> 01:06:09,633
You have come, beloved,
most beautiful of all.

365
01:06:13,725 --> 01:06:23,471
How the days are long, and lonely, dearest,
when I must be without you.

366
01:06:23,471 --> 01:06:36,798
Doubting, my heart is suffering tortures,
all that I cherish,

367
01:06:36,998 --> 01:06:48,027
all that my longing heart ever has hoped for,
the dream of love and passion that I dreamed now is shattered.

368
01:06:48,227 --> 01:06:53,047
I know:—you suffer.

369
01:06:53,247 --> 01:07:10,139
No sleep at night and yet you dream;
for day and night you always dream about Marina!

370
01:07:10,339 --> 01:07:18,607
Yet there's no sacrifice, however great,
that you won't bring for me,
if love demands it so!

371
01:07:21,797 --> 01:07:29,223
But when will you set out for Moscow as the Tsar?

372
01:07:29,223 --> 01:07:30,871
The Tsar?

373
01:07:31,071 --> 01:07:45,720
How cruel you can be, Marina,
in all your words I feel the chilly wind of winter.

374
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:55,604
See me lying at your feet,
a humble slave, I beg of you:

375
01:07:55,804 --> 01:08:07,155
do not deny me, and my ardent passion!

376
01:08:08,845 --> 01:08:11,748
Serve your Polish masters, you impostor!

377
01:08:11,948 --> 01:08:14,263
Marina-hear me first!

378
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:19,891
Go away, Polish slave!

379
01:08:20,091 --> 01:08:24,586
No, Marina!

380
01:08:24,786 --> 01:08:35,084
I will not have you throw into my face the bitter lot
of times that are behind me.
Lies! and you know you're lying.

381
01:08:35,284 --> 01:08:40,260
I am the Tsarevich!

382
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:53,417
And one day soon from Russia's farthest regions
a host of valiant men will heed the call of duty -

383
01:08:53,617 --> 01:09:04,553
I will lead them all! We will march on Moscow
and conquer the throne that fate has willed to me!

384
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:23,517
Yes, and then, as Tsar and master, enthroned in lonely splendor,
I shall sit above you, laughing and jeering at you!

385
01:09:23,717 --> 01:09:32,527
I shall be happy seeing you humbled at last,
and you, in abject obedience,
bewailing the glory that could have been yours,
will be crawling up to the throne on which I sit.

386
01:09:35,278 --> 01:09:40,732
Everyone will point a mocking finger at the foolish Polish lady,
and deride you!

387
01:09:40,932 --> 01:09:42,587
Deride me?

388
01:09:44,145 --> 01:10:00,502
My Tsarevich! I beseech you,
do forgive me for the evil words that I spoke.

389
01:10:00,702 --> 01:10:20,718
If I blamed you, if I scorned you,
believe me, Dimitri: love inspired all my words
love for your glory,
a deep, abiding love for you my master.

390
01:10:20,918 --> 01:10:44,673
My Lord and Tsar!
You may put all your trust in your Marina,

391
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:58,057
forget, yes, forget your Marina!

392
01:10:58,257 --> 01:11:15,841
Let fame be your only love,
and conquer the throne of the Tsar!

393
01:11:16,041 --> 01:11:28,635
Marina! Oh, how I wish
that your words were true -
do not betray a love that is holy!

394
01:11:28,835 --> 01:11:37,874
I love you, Tsar!
Yes, I love you. You are my hero!

395
01:11:38,074 --> 01:12:00,750
Oh—let me hear it again, Marina.
Yes, this deep delight that you promise me
will bring peace to my tortured heart,
for ever and ever you are mine!

396
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:05,295
My Tsar!

397
01:12:25,844 --> 01:12:36,140
- You, Tsarina, you will be forever mine!
- You have conquered my heart, and I love you.

398
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:46,464
- Come, and embrace the man you love.
- I'm forever yours. Oh, my Dimitri, the Tsar you will be!

399
01:12:46,664 --> 01:12:55,613
vivat! vivat!

400
01:13:49,513 --> 01:13:53,581
Say—is the service over?

401
01:13:53,781 --> 01:13:59,589
Yes, and once again he was cursed!

402
01:13:59,789 --> 01:14:08,232
What do you mean?
Once more they cursed Grishka Otrepyev's name.

403
01:14:08,432 --> 01:14:11,186
Grishka?

404
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:25,291
Listen, brothers, let me tell you
how the deacon, the fat one,

405
01:14:25,491 --> 01:14:37,260
started yelling:
"Grishka Otrepyev — Anathema!"

406
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:44,320
This is very funny - why should Dimitri care
if they are cursing Grishka?

407
01:14:44,781 --> 01:14:49,604
That's certain.

408
01:14:50,627 --> 01:14:53,762
 He is not Grishka!

409
01:14:53,962 --> 01:15:01,561
The Tsarevich is not Grishka.

410
01:15:02,218 --> 01:15:04,387
He's not Grishka

411
01:15:05,592 --> 01:15:23,030
For the Tsarevich they sang a requiem.

412
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:31,143
For a man that's alive?
Well, just wait.

413
01:15:31,864 --> 01:15:40,468
Our Tsarevich's alive,
he'll show Boris!

414
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:47,778
Some have seen him in the Kromy woods.

415
01:15:49,013 --> 01:15:56,680
They say his troops can't be very far from Moscow.
And soon he will destroy Boris and all his might.

416
01:15:57,110 --> 01:16:06,373
Triumphant, he will mount the golden steps
to the throne that rules over Russia.

417
01:16:06,573 --> 01:16:14,572
He'll save us all.
Through him Boris and all his henchmen will be doomed.

418
01:16:15,977 --> 01:16:25,305
Will you shut up? Stupid devils,
or are you longing for the torture-chamber?

419
01:16:27,905 --> 01:16:38,470
Trr, trr, trr, tr . . .
his hat is of tin - it makes such a din!

420
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:10,615
In the sky the moon is shining,
on earth, a kitten whining

421
01:17:10,815 --> 01:17:26,458
get up, you simpleton,
pray to God above you,

422
01:17:29,187 --> 01:17:44,290
ask that He should love you,
praise Lord Jesus!

423
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:57,958
Lovely weather . . . lovely moon-light

424
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:06,972
lovely weather

425
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:10,491
moon-light

426
01:18:15,465 --> 01:18:19,648
Greetings! Greetings,
dear simpleton Ivanich,

427
01:18:19,848 --> 01:18:32,461
get up and greet us!
Bow to show us your respect
and take off your cap —such a heavy cap .

428
01:18:34,325 --> 01:18:40,194
I have a kopeck, I'm hiding it here!

429
01:18:40,394 --> 01:18:43,325
Liar!
Do not try to fool us, fool!

430
01:18:46,837 --> 01:18:48,146
- Here

431
01:18:48,346 --> 01:18:55,452
Ah—ah—
Why did you take my kopeck away?

432
01:18:55,652 --> 01:19:02,101
Ah—ah—
Come and give it back to me!

433
01:19:02,301 --> 01:19:07,817
ah ... ah ... ah

434
01:19:07,817 --> 01:19:19,545
Please, in the name of Christ,
do save us from hunger! Tsar—Father,
in the name of the Saviour!

435
01:19:19,745 --> 01:19:26,254
Look, there's the Tsar.
Tsar — in the name of Jesus, our Saviour
you are our father.

436
01:19:26,454 --> 01:19:34,714
have mercy on us,
for we all are your children!
In the name of Lord Jesus, our Saviour.

437
01:19:34,914 --> 01:19:47,874
Your people cry — we're hungry
Tsar, give us bread to eat!
We are hungry Tsar—give us bread to eat!
In the name of Lord Jesus.

438
01:19:47,874 --> 01:20:10,313
We are hungry Tsar—give us bread to eat!
In the name of Lord Jesus.

439
01:20:14,405 --> 01:20:20,114
ah - ah - ah

440
01:20:24,614 --> 01:20:29,491
Boris, hear, Boris!

441
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:41,311
Those wicked boys are nasty to me.
ah - ah - ah

442
01:20:48,397 --> 01:20:52,242
Why does he cry so?

443
01:20:52,442 --> 01:20:57,382
Those boys,
they took my only kopeck away.

444
01:20:57,582 --> 01:21:05,001
Why don't you have them murdered?

445
01:21:07,356 --> 01:21:16,459
The way you murdered long ago our little Tsarevich!

446
01:21:17,754 --> 01:21:22,133
Be silent, fool!
Arrest the stupid fool!

447
01:21:30,123 --> 01:21:33,225
Don't touch him!

448
01:21:34,943 --> 01:21:42,810
Go, pray for me,
holy fool.

449
01:21:43,010 --> 01:21:43,871
No, Boris -

450
01:21:44,071 --> 01:21:48,580
I cannot pray for you, Boris.

451
01:21:50,355 --> 01:22:02,213
I cannot pray for King Herod.

452
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:22,303
The Holy Virgin forbids it.

453
01:22:52,265 --> 01:22:56,539
Let's set him down - right here,
let's make him comfortable.
Sit down!

454
01:22:56,739 --> 01:23:03,235
And so that he won't yell,
and that his noble throat won't suffer damage,
let's stop his mouth! That's it!

455
01:23:03,435 --> 01:23:10,583
But, listen: here sits a Boyar,
and you do not pay him homage.

456
01:23:10,783 --> 01:23:17,134
- What? No one greets him?
- That's a scandal!
Friends of Boris deserve more honor!

457
01:23:17,334 --> 01:23:27,318
Boris, the robber Tsar, he stole the throne of Russia,
but then this robber robbed the thief!
So—let's honor him for that, like any decent thief.

458
01:23:27,518 --> 01:23:37,215
Hey! Fomka—Epiklan, be his body-guard.
That's it.

459
01:23:39,328 --> 01:23:56,402
Dim in the sky are sun and moon —
and all the stars will have vanished soon—
the day of final reckoning has begun
for all the evil deeds Boris has done.

460
01:23:56,402 --> 01:24:13,624
Deep is the grief of this holy land,
and heavy is the hand of him who scorned the Lord,
that threefold cursed hand of him who killed a Tsar
for his sins he will pay in all eternity!

461
01:24:13,586 --> 01:24:19,041
Everywhere Boris has his henchmen,
who torture innocent people!

462
01:24:19,241 --> 01:24:23,915
Everywhere Boris has his henchmen,
who torture innocent people!

463
01:24:24,115 --> 01:24:31,135
Torture most frightful, hanging and beating,
the true believers must suffer

464
01:24:31,335 --> 01:24:35,593
- Death!
Death!

465
01:24:37,091 --> 01:24:42,955
Death for Boris!
Death for the killer Tsar!

466
01:24:43,155 --> 01:24:45,918
Kill Boris, the killer Tsar!

467
01:24:46,118 --> 01:24:53,741
He who has killed must die!

468
01:25:06,861 --> 01:25:11,475
Well Boyars, let's take a vote on it.

469
01:25:13,186 --> 01:25:16,946
First, tell us
what you think about him?

470
01:25:17,146 --> 01:25:22,520
Well—our opinion is,
and always has been:

471
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:25,461
- take notes, Andrei Mikhailich -

472
01:25:27,696 --> 01:25:36,549
The scoundrel, whoever he may be,
once he's caught, he shall be tortured

473
01:25:36,549 --> 01:25:41,379
and then we'll kill him,
and we'll hang his body

474
01:25:41,579 --> 01:25:46,137
Let him be food for the hungry crows!

475
01:25:48,686 --> 01:26:04,077
No! the flames shall burn his body,
and all the people shall be present to witness his death
and curse his ashes three times.

476
01:26:09,714 --> 01:26:23,007
And, falling on our knees, we'll pray and ask the Lord
to have mercy on our Russia,

477
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:31,739
the long-suffering.

478
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:39,660
But . . . Shuiski is not with us?

479
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:46,144
though he's a traitor,
when he is not with us
we miss him in our council.

480
01:26:46,344 --> 01:26:48,844
Boyars! I ask your pardon!

481
01:26:49,044 --> 01:26:51,857
Why, speaking of the devil!

482
01:26:52,057 --> 01:27:01,009
If I am late, forgive me,
and do believe me that I have my reasons!

483
01:27:03,044 --> 01:27:15,251
Last week I saw the Tsar, and when I left him,
my heart was heavy with pity for his soul's affliction . . .

484
01:27:15,451 --> 01:27:26,256
A secret door was open . . . and I saw ...

485
01:27:26,456 --> 01:27:30,333
Oh what a sight I witnessed, Boyars!

486
01:27:30,533 --> 01:27:41,195
His body shaking and mumbling to himself,
some strange and incoherent phrases,
a secret pain distorting his features.

487
01:27:41,395 --> 01:27:47,231
Thus I saw the Tsar of all the Russias!

488
01:27:47,231 --> 01:27:56,156
Then he began to stare into a corner,
he started to moan and to shiver.

489
01:27:56,156 --> 01:27:57,583
Lies! Lies!

490
01:27:57,583 --> 01:28:07,555
and, crying out, he called the dead Dimitri,
Seeing his ghost, he raised his hands to chase it

491
01:28:07,755 --> 01:28:10,724
"Away! away" he begged.

492
01:28:10,924 --> 01:28:13,853
- Away, away!
- Away, my child!

493
01:28:18,241 --> 01:28:20,430
Heaven! It's he!

494
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:26,611
Help us. Lord
Almighty God: have mercy and protect us!

495
01:28:28,234 --> 01:28:30,454
Away - away!

496
01:28:35,689 --> 01:28:38,857
Who says that I have killed him?

497
01:28:40,625 --> 01:28:43,748
It is not true:

498
01:28:46,057 --> 01:28:49,540
The child lives!

499
01:28:52,525 --> 01:28:58,640
And Shuiski -
I will have him drawn and quartered for all his lies!

500
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:02,628
May the Heaven's blessing be with you!

501
01:29:04,797 --> 01:29:08,412
What?

502
01:29:27,417 --> 01:29:33,299
I called for you, Boyars,

503
01:29:34,671 --> 01:29:41,552
because I always trust your wisdom.

504
01:29:43,447 --> 01:29:59,826
In times of danger and bitter trials
you are the guardians of my power, Boyars!

505
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:08,970
Almighty Lord and Tsar!
You know I am your humble slave,

506
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:14,058
yet duty bids me speak:

507
01:30:15,863 --> 01:30:28,838
here's what happened, Tsar:
a man came to your door,
he's very old and humbly hopes he might be allowed
to stand before his sovereign.

508
01:30:29,038 --> 01:30:46,695
A man of truth and wisdom,
his life was pure and blameless,
he says he knows a secret that he must tell you.

509
01:30:46,913 --> 01:30:55,743
Very well, Prince,
admit the man!

510
01:31:14,591 --> 01:31:23,351
One evening, close on the night, a shepherd came to me.

511
01:31:23,551 --> 01:31:35,583
His face was old with wrinkles.
he sat with me and this is what he told me:

512
01:31:36,846 --> 01:31:59,747
"From early childhood" he started
"I was blind, I'd never seen the dark of night nor daylight,
my eyes were dead!"

513
01:31:59,947 --> 01:32:19,626
Once ... I heard a voice in dreaming,
soft and childish, it called my name,
I still hear that voice . . .

514
01:32:19,826 --> 01:32:44,497
"Come! get up at once, find out where Uglich is,
go there and enter the cathedral.
And then you kneel and pray where my grave lies.

515
01:32:44,497 --> 01:32:54,447
"Know this, old man.
I am Dimitri, your Tsarevich!

516
01:32:54,647 --> 01:33:12,553
But I am now among the Angels of the Lord
and am endowed with all the blessed gifts of healing!"

517
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:16,545
I'm choking—choking!
Help me!

518
01:33:29,837 --> 01:33:33,651
I want to see the Tsarevich.

519
01:33:33,851 --> 01:33:38,178
I , . . cannot breathe . . .
cannot . . .

520
01:33:59,606 --> 01:34:07,244
Leave us alone,
all of you!

521
01:34:14,707 --> 01:34:22,698
Farewell, my son,
I am dying ...

522
01:34:29,070 --> 01:34:34,926
from now on
you will be the Tsar!

523
01:34:35,126 --> 01:34:43,111
Don't ever ask
how I ascended to this throne,

524
01:34:43,311 --> 01:34:48,017
my son,
you need not know. . . .

525
01:34:48,217 --> 01:34:55,547
Tsar you shall be,
and rightful ruler

526
01:34:55,747 --> 01:35:02,349
as my successor,
my son, my first-begotten.

527
01:35:04,484 --> 01:35:15,297
Hear me! My dear child!

528
01:35:15,497 --> 01:35:22,512
Do not trust the slanders of the seditious boyars,

529
01:35:22,712 --> 01:35:29,502
Never forget
that some are traitors in league with Lithuania.

530
01:35:29,702 --> 01:35:37,950
Punish treachery without pity,
without mercy!

531
01:35:38,150 --> 01:35:48,068
Yet, to be just in your judgment,
listen to your people.

532
01:35:48,268 --> 01:35:59,865
Like a warrior, defend the true belief,

533
01:36:00,065 --> 01:36:13,669
and revere the Saints,
and ask them to bless you.

534
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:24,748
Oh Lord! Lord!

535
01:36:26,176 --> 01:36:35,045
Look down upon a sinful father's tears.

536
01:36:35,045 --> 01:36:47,051
Not for myself I pray,
not for myself I beg You! Father!

537
01:36:53,526 --> 01:37:20,120
See my children,
send to them the light of Your unending love,—

538
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:29,575
Protect them both, forever. They are guiltless.

539
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:39,165
Angels of God the Lord:

540
01:37:41,976 --> 01:37:47,823
You who guard the eternal throne

541
01:37:51,671 --> 01:38:20,375
unfold your shining wings to give him shelter,
to save my son, my Fyodor, from every ill,
and from temptation.

542
01:38:32,599 --> 01:38:40,750
Hear those sepulchral sounds!

543
01:38:48,529 --> 01:39:00,667
Mortal brothers, weep and cry:
for his end is near...

544
01:39:00,867 --> 01:39:10,728
The funeral dirge ...
give me . . . the cloister's vestments

545
01:39:12,108 --> 01:39:19,876
the Tsar
withdraws to God!

546
01:39:19,876 --> 01:39:29,530
... his lips will close in eternal silence
Mercy! Hallelujah!

547
01:39:30,086 --> 01:39:36,058
Mighty Tsar, have courage,
the Lord will help you.

548
01:39:36,058 --> 01:39:42,390
No, no, my son,
this is the end.

549
01:39:46,849 --> 01:39:56,677
Dying, a child appears before our eyes,
we lament it, poor child ...

550
01:39:56,877 --> 01:40:10,008
Oh Lord, I am sorely afflicted.
Will my sins never be forgiven?

551
01:40:10,008 --> 01:40:12,953
... it struggles, it moans and sobs
and cries and begs for mercy,

552
01:40:13,153 --> 01:40:21,713
Oh fearful Death,
how cruel is your torture!

553
01:40:21,713 --> 01:40:28,941
... and cries and begs for mercy,
but death will show no mercy!

554
01:40:29,141 --> 01:40:40,625
Wait!
I still am Tsar!

555
01:40:41,819 --> 01:40:44,525
I still am Tsar!

556
01:40:46,156 --> 01:40:50,711
Heaven! Death!

557
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:54,466
forgive me, all ...

558
01:40:54,666 --> 01:40:57,520
the Tsar is now ...

559
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:00,387
Tsar ...

560
01:41:01,822 --> 01:41:04,255
forgive me ...

561
01:41:05,180 --> 01:41:06,610
forgive ...

562
01:42:20,609 --> 01:42:30,477
Ever rising, ever spreading grows the people's might.

563
01:42:30,677 --> 01:42:33,808
Like an ever-swelling tide.

564
01:42:59,378 --> 01:43:09,295
Bid him welcome, dearest friends,
the one and only Tsar!

565
01:43:09,495 --> 01:43:17,329
Bid him welcome,
him whom the Lord has saved
from the evil hands of his vilest foe!

566
01:43:17,529 --> 01:43:27,085
Bid him welcome, dearest friends,
and greet Dimitri, noble son of Ivan!

567
01:43:27,285 --> 01:43:38,014
Domine, Domine, salvum fac ...

568
01:43:38,214 --> 01:43:44,181
Nasty ravens, both of them.
It seems they also are defending the rightful Tsar.

569
01:43:44,381 --> 01:43:48,205
We won't have it, father Missail!

570
01:43:48,405 --> 01:43:50,981
We won't have it!

571
01:43:51,181 --> 01:44:03,803
Domine, Domine, salvum fac Regem,
Regem Demetrium Moscoviae ...

572
01:44:04,003 --> 01:44:07,232
Let's kill the cursed ravens!

573
01:44:07,432 --> 01:44:16,314
A tree! A tree! A rope!
Yes! we will hang you three-fold cursed enemies!

574
01:44:16,514 --> 01:44:21,287
Yes, dearest friends,
we will hang them on the highest tree!

575
01:44:21,287 --> 01:44:27,387
There they can pray for the universe in eternity!

576
01:44:56,795 --> 01:45:05,575
We, Dimitri Ivanovich,
by the grace of God, the Lord,
Tsarevich of all the Russias,

577
01:45:05,775 --> 01:45:14,085
Prince of the blood of noble forebears,
We assure you victims of Godunov of our kindness.

578
01:45:14,285 --> 01:45:21,751
To those whom Godunov made suffer
we will grant protection!

579
01:45:21,951 --> 01:45:27,157
Mighty Lord, our Tsar Dimitri,
glory to you!

580
01:45:27,357 --> 01:45:31,497
Rise, Boyars!

581
01:45:31,697 --> 01:45:42,656
I lead you fight with me
to free the land of our fathers!

582
01:45:42,856 --> 01:45:47,572
With me march on to Moscow!

583
01:45:47,772 --> 01:45:56,739
Deo gloria! Deo gloria!

584
01:45:56,939 --> 01:46:06,288
Deo gloria! Deo gloria!

585
01:46:41,137 --> 01:46:53,010
Gush forth, gush forth,
bitter tears!

586
01:46:53,210 --> 01:47:10,769
weep, weep, faithful heart,
weep in deep anguish:

587
01:47:13,213 --> 01:47:29,321
soon the foe will come
and darkness will fall

588
01:47:29,521 --> 01:47:45,268
night will blind us all
and no hope of dawn.

589
01:47:45,468 --> 01:48:02,506
Russia's sorrow is great.
Weep, weep, Russian people,

590
01:48:02,706 --> 01:48:12,984
starving people ...

591
01:48:15,525 --> 01:48:23,735
Thus ends Mussogsky's musical drama
"BORIS GODUNOV"

592
