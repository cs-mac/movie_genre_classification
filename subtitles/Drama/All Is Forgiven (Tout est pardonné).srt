Smile.

00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:38,323
Good.

<i>Neil hits him for the
six, a terrific shot,</i>

<i>Eldridge fields the ball.</i>

00:01:45,432 --> 00:01:47,266
<i>The crowd is really tense now</i>

<i>as it's Tyson's turn</i>

<i>to take up the attack again.</i>

00:01:50,738 --> 00:01:52,671
<i>The Typhoon bowls with avidity</i>

11
00:01:52,673 --> 00:01:54,740
<i>and it's slightly wide...</i>

12
00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:21,767
Today, I'm gonna
tell you a little story

13
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:22,968
of a witch

14
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,806
who was called <i>Nomahange.</i>

15
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:41,018
In a big pot, and
while they're cooking

16
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,953
the witch will sing

17
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:46,426
<i>Sisiboge!</i>

18
00:02:49,896 --> 00:02:51,762
Piet, Piet!!

19
00:02:51,764 --> 00:02:53,631
It's my... it's my Pa!

20
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:55,399
Come on.

21
00:02:55,401 --> 00:02:57,035
Don't worry, don't worry.

22
00:02:57,037 --> 00:02:58,539
I'm going to talk to him.

23
00:03:01,608 --> 00:03:03,041
You little bastard!

24
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:05,013
I told you not to come here.

25
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:19,753
<i>Voetsek!</i>

26
00:04:25,092 --> 00:04:26,691
Where is my daughter?

27
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:28,527
She hasn't been home
since last night.

28
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:30,028
No.

29
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,763
Just get out of here.
No.

30
00:04:31,765 --> 00:04:33,898
Just get out of here.
No. Where is my daughter?

31
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,600
No!

32
00:04:35,602 --> 00:04:36,667
Get out of here.

33
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:38,003
Just get out of here.

34
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:22,547
Hi, there.
Archbishop!

35
00:05:22,549 --> 00:05:23,814
Kefilwe,

36
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:25,018
I'll be right there!

37
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:43,501
Oh, you're right, she is beautiful.

38
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:44,638
Yes.

39
00:05:46,106 --> 00:05:48,543
When did your daughter disappear?

40
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:52,546
She disappeared
three year, Father.

41
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:56,814
Go on, please.

42
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:58,917
She go in the night.

43
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,552
She say she very afraid.

44
00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:04,588
She go to see
her boyfriend Osiswe.

45
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,991
She did tell me that Osiswe

46
00:06:05,993 --> 00:06:08,729
was in the mix
of security police.

47
00:06:12,566 --> 00:06:14,266
Father,

48
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:16,268
they're not coming back,

49
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,203
not she, not Osiswe,

50
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:19,207
are they?

51
00:06:21,241 --> 00:06:23,542
I'm gonna to look into it.

52
00:06:23,544 --> 00:06:24,745
I promise.

53
00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:33,821
Blomfeld! Come!

54
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:40,292
Come, Blomfeld!

55
00:06:49,803 --> 00:06:52,636
Hey, Blommie!
Hey, Blommie.

56
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:53,905
Hey, Blommie, Blommie.

57
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:10,657
Blomfeld.

58
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,239
Stop!

59
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:29,874
For fuck sake!

60
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:31,775
I been searched a dozen
times already, Kruger.

61
00:07:31,777 --> 00:07:34,581
And now you get
searched again, Blomfeld.

62
00:07:39,152 --> 00:07:40,318
You looking
for some hospital time

63
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,956
and a compensation claim, boy?

64
00:07:44,191 --> 00:07:46,256
Come. Walk.

65
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:09,114
The fuck are you staring at, <i>kaffir?</i>

66
00:08:09,116 --> 00:08:10,948
Not in my office,

67
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,282
unless you want me to throw this

68
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:13,852
in the waste bin.

69
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:19,758
Prisoner Blomfeld,

70
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,660
do you seriously think
the Archbishop

71
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:23,694
is going to bother to read this?

72
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:25,896
Let alone come
all the way out here

73
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:28,168
to see a convicted
death squad assassin?

74
00:08:32,171 --> 00:08:34,008
Dismissed!
Get him out of here.

75
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,616
Check you later, <i>poes.</i>

76
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:51,923
Well...

77
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:53,724
they're right.

78
00:08:53,726 --> 00:08:55,760
The tumor is halted, Your Grace.

79
00:08:55,762 --> 00:08:59,097
But it's too early
to be speaking of remission.

80
00:08:59,099 --> 00:09:00,732
Only time will tell.

81
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:02,199
So I can be run over

82
00:09:02,201 --> 00:09:04,068
by a bus tomorrow

83
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,938
and then I'll die a healthy man.

84
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:09,873
I heard your interview

85
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,809
on the radio.

86
00:09:11,811 --> 00:09:14,011
Truth and reconciliation
between all sides

87
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:16,414
would be a fine thing.

88
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,915
But it's too early

89
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:19,217
for us to be speaking
of remission?

90
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:21,886
May I have a word
in private, Doctor Biehl,

91
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:24,889
away from these ears
of this old goat?

92
00:09:24,891 --> 00:09:27,257
She's going to ask you to ask me

93
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:29,894
to rest.
No. I'm going to tell him

94
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:31,996
to order you to rest.

95
00:09:31,998 --> 00:09:34,866
When Mandela asked me to head

96
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:38,902
the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission,

97
00:09:38,904 --> 00:09:41,805
he gave me a choice

98
00:09:41,807 --> 00:09:44,108
precisely because he knew

99
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,810
I had no choice.

100
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:50,150
When the President speaks...

101
00:09:51,218 --> 00:09:52,751
we have no choice,

102
00:09:52,753 --> 00:09:54,318
do we, Doctor?

103
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,487
It seems not.

104
00:09:55,489 --> 00:09:58,490
Exactly! See?

105
00:09:58,492 --> 00:09:59,827
Move.

106
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:03,261
We grant amnesty to a black face,

107
00:10:03,263 --> 00:10:05,796
we are accused of being biased;

108
00:10:05,798 --> 00:10:08,031
If we grant amnesty to a white,

109
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:10,901
we are accused of being
Boer stooges.

110
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:12,270
It's impossible.
Sise,

111
00:10:12,272 --> 00:10:14,104
difficult is not
the same thing as impossible,

112
00:10:14,106 --> 00:10:15,939
is it, Archbishop?

113
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:17,744
Two politicians

114
00:10:19,012 --> 00:10:20,181
are deadlocked.

115
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:23,147
In the end...

116
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:25,784
one says,

117
00:10:25,786 --> 00:10:27,151
"Look,

118
00:10:27,153 --> 00:10:30,255
I'll admit I'm wrong

119
00:10:30,257 --> 00:10:33,893
if you'll admit I'm right."

120
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,529
"Agreed, agreed,

121
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:40,165
but you go first."

122
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:41,866
"Okay.

123
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:44,803
I'm wrong,"

124
00:10:44,805 --> 00:10:46,270
says the first politician.

125
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:48,405
And the second politician yells,

126
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:50,110
he yells,

127
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:54,145
"You're right!
You're right!

128
00:10:54,147 --> 00:10:55,979
You are wrong!
You are wrong!"

129
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,253
Bish, it's for you

130
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:08,860
Good people all over the world

131
00:11:08,862 --> 00:11:11,829
are praying for our success.

132
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:13,331
Well, maybe they need

133
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,166
to pray a bit harder.

134
00:11:16,168 --> 00:11:18,001
Oh, Alex, have hope.

135
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:21,206
No. You're gonna need
stamina, leading that lot.

136
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:25,009
Yes. But if the
Commission can weld itself

137
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:28,847
into somewhat of a united group,

138
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:31,852
then there's hope
for the nation.

139
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:50,037
Is that Blomfeld's letter?

140
00:11:51,271 --> 00:11:52,603
Yes, it is.

141
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:54,104
Which should have been shredded,

142
00:11:54,106 --> 00:11:56,040
as I advised.

143
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:58,610
I can't get it out
of my head, Vinnie.

144
00:11:58,612 --> 00:12:01,945
It is... it's so articulate.

145
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:05,186
He quotes Plato's <i>Republic</i>

146
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,620
and...

147
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:11,356
John Milton.

148
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:13,958
It's just...

149
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,559
it's quite engaging.

150
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:17,527
Don't go to Pollsmoor,

151
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,063
that's my advice.

152
00:12:19,065 --> 00:12:22,467
He's, um, only out
to harm you, you know,

153
00:12:22,469 --> 00:12:24,501
he'll try and destroy you.

154
00:12:24,503 --> 00:12:25,937
Don't exaggerate.

155
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:28,106
Don't.
Father,

156
00:12:28,108 --> 00:12:30,408
he's a psychopath
and a convicted killer.

157
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,976
I know who he is.

158
00:12:31,978 --> 00:12:33,113
Well, then?

159
00:12:36,282 --> 00:12:38,016
No one...

160
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:40,651
is beyond redemption, Vinnie.

161
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,343
Hmm.

162
00:13:06,345 --> 00:13:08,478
<i>Prisoner Blomfeld, go to C-Block.</i>

163
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,116
<i>You have a visitor.</i>

164
00:13:12,018 --> 00:13:14,452
Oh. All right.
Nice one.

165
00:13:14,454 --> 00:13:16,154
Bloody Hell.

166
00:13:16,156 --> 00:13:17,324
He fell over.

167
00:14:12,512 --> 00:14:14,114
Thank you, Sergeant.

168
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:18,516
<i>The fucking prison bastard</i>

169
00:14:18,518 --> 00:14:20,284
told me you wouldn't come.

170
00:14:20,286 --> 00:14:22,620
"No way," he said.

171
00:14:22,622 --> 00:14:23,688
But I knew you would come.

172
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,756
I knew you wouldn't be able

173
00:14:24,758 --> 00:14:27,424
to resist it.

174
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:29,394
Genius.

175
00:14:29,396 --> 00:14:31,294
Well, you are sure

176
00:14:31,296 --> 00:14:33,064
that I would come,

177
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:36,003
so I'm sure
that you are prepared.

178
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,368
Don't play with me, bru.

179
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,804
Don't delude yourself.

180
00:14:39,806 --> 00:14:41,338
Delude myself?

181
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,540
Thinking you can get inside here.

182
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:45,242
<i>Well, then</i>

183
00:14:45,244 --> 00:14:47,211
<i>let's stop the games</i>

184
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:48,780
before they go any further.

185
00:14:48,782 --> 00:14:51,082
This is no fucking game, <i>kaffir.</i>

186
00:14:51,084 --> 00:14:53,152
Hey. Hmm.

187
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:58,158
"Father."

188
00:14:59,591 --> 00:15:01,995
"Father"...will do.

189
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,229
You got to be kidding yourself

190
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:08,399
that what's gonna
happen here is random.

191
00:15:08,401 --> 00:15:10,200
I've read all about you.

192
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:11,301
Studied it.

193
00:15:11,303 --> 00:15:12,536
I've got plenty of time to do

194
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:13,539
what I need to do.

195
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,443
Mr. Blomfeld,

196
00:15:18,445 --> 00:15:21,015
what is it that you want?

197
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:24,651
Is it amnesty?

198
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:28,785
And if it is?

199
00:15:28,787 --> 00:15:30,387
Well, now,

200
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:32,622
I'm not saying that I can even

201
00:15:32,624 --> 00:15:35,593
consider your application.

202
00:15:35,595 --> 00:15:38,795
But if you want to be free,

203
00:15:38,797 --> 00:15:41,432
from then part of the process

204
00:15:41,434 --> 00:15:43,101
in seeking amnesty...

205
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,669
"Involves making a full

206
00:15:44,671 --> 00:15:46,103
and frank confession,

207
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:47,505
leaving nothing out."

208
00:15:47,507 --> 00:15:49,607
I know, I can bloody read.

209
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:52,309
You will have
to seek forgiveness.

210
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:54,511
You must ask for it.

211
00:15:54,513 --> 00:15:56,280
Forgiveness?

212
00:15:56,282 --> 00:15:58,748
Forgiveness for what?

213
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,586
For offing some black
bastard thieving scum

214
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:04,121
trying to steal my country?
It's our country.

215
00:16:04,123 --> 00:16:05,589
Fuck that! Your country.

216
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,757
What have your people
ever done to build it?

217
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,761
Two years ago,
we had an election.

218
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:13,197
A free election,

219
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,867
where anyone who wanted

220
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:19,303
to vote could do so

221
00:16:19,305 --> 00:16:21,842
without violence.

222
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,547
Now, that is an achievement.

223
00:16:29,681 --> 00:16:32,617
That's what helps you sleep
easy at night, is it?

224
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:35,152
Pride in your achievement,

225
00:16:35,154 --> 00:16:36,419
hmm?

226
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:38,392
Listen, boy...
Uh-uh,

227
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:42,529
"Father." We agreed on that.

228
00:16:44,163 --> 00:16:47,497
How does it feel...
hmm?

229
00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:50,468
Colluding with your
former white masters?

230
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,502
Colluding?

231
00:16:52,504 --> 00:16:54,472
In what way?
Once a slave,

232
00:16:54,474 --> 00:16:56,240
always a slave.

233
00:16:56,242 --> 00:16:58,175
Your white masters
haven't gone away,

234
00:16:58,177 --> 00:16:59,443
have they?

235
00:16:59,445 --> 00:17:00,578
You're still serving them

236
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,179
the same <i>kak!</i>

237
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:03,581
Except now it's called

238
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,183
"reconciliation".

239
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:07,584
You're covering them,

240
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:09,653
that's what it amounts to.

241
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,855
Come on,

242
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:12,923
be honest,

243
00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:15,192
it's easy if you try.

244
00:17:15,194 --> 00:17:17,862
We either learn to live together

245
00:17:17,864 --> 00:17:19,764
in this country

246
00:17:19,766 --> 00:17:21,666
or we will die together

247
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:23,633
in this country.

248
00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:25,635
Well done, <i>kaffir!</i>

249
00:17:27,273 --> 00:17:29,606
You've grasped the bottom line.

250
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:33,276
Life is one animal
eating another.

251
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:34,679
Death is one animal

252
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:35,880
being eaten by another.

253
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:37,848
You either have a full belly

254
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,916
or you're in a full belly.

255
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:41,585
Darwin. Unalterable facts.

256
00:17:41,587 --> 00:17:43,487
The rest is just
window dressing.

257
00:17:43,489 --> 00:17:44,758
Chintz.

258
00:17:46,392 --> 00:17:48,228
We are all God's children.

259
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,228
We are all connected

260
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,333
by a common humanity.

261
00:17:55,401 --> 00:17:58,505
I could tell you a thing
or two about humanity,

262
00:17:59,972 --> 00:18:01,772
about what's buried
in the red earth

263
00:18:01,774 --> 00:18:04,511
of this country, hmm?

264
00:18:06,312 --> 00:18:08,478
About "Disappearing,"

265
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,981
about the "Elimination,"

266
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:14,285
about the "Unconventional
Operational Methods,"

267
00:18:14,287 --> 00:18:16,890
about "Hit Squads,"
about "Hacksaw".

268
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:21,458
Oh, yeah.

269
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,265
So you think we share
a common humanity, <i>kaffir?</i>

270
00:18:26,966 --> 00:18:28,798
We are...

271
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,003
all capable of acts
of depravity.

272
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:33,638
Even you? Yes?

273
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,439
Yes, even me.

274
00:18:35,441 --> 00:18:37,475
Good boy!

275
00:18:37,477 --> 00:18:39,643
Now, the truth... When you sit
on that commission of yours,

276
00:18:39,645 --> 00:18:41,414
don't tell me
you don't feel anger?

277
00:18:42,781 --> 00:18:44,849
Oh, I feel anger.

278
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:47,485
And you wonder, don't you?

279
00:18:47,487 --> 00:18:48,819
Why God just doesn't

280
00:18:48,821 --> 00:18:50,487
fucking wipe the slate clean

281
00:18:50,489 --> 00:18:52,325
of his two-legged creation?

282
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,597
Sometimes I wonder that.

283
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:05,002
I feel sorry for you,

284
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:06,506
mission-school boy.

285
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:11,308
Turn the other cheek, hey?

286
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,577
To forgive is a choice

287
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:17,348
made by other ordinary people

288
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,417
much more courageous

289
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:22,352
than I will ever be.
Ah! Come on!

290
00:19:22,354 --> 00:19:24,755
Be a man. Own the fire
in your belly.

291
00:19:24,757 --> 00:19:27,725
Go for it.
I refuse your version

292
00:19:27,727 --> 00:19:29,560
of humanity,

293
00:19:29,562 --> 00:19:31,896
and I intend to continue

294
00:19:31,898 --> 00:19:33,797
to struggle...

295
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:34,867
against it.

296
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:42,843
How many on that commission
of yours are priests?

297
00:19:45,577 --> 00:19:47,077
Four.

298
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:49,880
Clever, our leaders,
aren't they?

299
00:19:49,882 --> 00:19:53,383
Forgiveness is fucking baked
into the cake.

300
00:19:53,385 --> 00:19:54,919
Civil war,

301
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:57,623
which you seem to want,

302
00:19:59,025 --> 00:20:01,624
is not in anyone's interest.

303
00:20:01,626 --> 00:20:04,094
A blood bath is inevitable.

304
00:20:04,096 --> 00:20:05,462
It's pure.

305
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:07,497
It's honest!

306
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:09,400
Out of the bloodbath

307
00:20:09,402 --> 00:20:11,401
emerges the victor.

308
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:13,103
The stronger, the superior,

309
00:20:13,105 --> 00:20:15,642
who the weak and inferior
have to kneel before.

310
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:21,379
You'll fail today

311
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:22,816
or you'll fail tomorrow.

312
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,449
I'm right, aren't I, <i>kaffir?</i>

313
00:20:26,451 --> 00:20:28,518
I can see it in your face,
you see,

314
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,086
I want the war between us

315
00:20:30,088 --> 00:20:32,590
to drag us all
into the bloody vortex,

316
00:20:32,592 --> 00:20:34,925
because the winner who emerges,

317
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:36,760
listen to me,

318
00:20:36,762 --> 00:20:38,597
will be white.

319
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,970
Visit's over.

320
00:20:46,972 --> 00:20:48,441
The visit's over!

321
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:56,516
Why did you ask me
to come here, Mr. Blomfeld?

322
00:20:58,116 --> 00:21:01,421
To offer you the very thing
you thought to offer me.

323
00:21:02,488 --> 00:21:05,456
Enlightenment.

324
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:06,957
We've been parading

325
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:09,560
our limitations all day.

326
00:21:09,562 --> 00:21:11,996
So, hopefully we'll find

327
00:21:11,998 --> 00:21:14,468
some enlightenment later.

328
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:19,102
I have killed.

329
00:21:19,104 --> 00:21:22,006
I've killed lots.

330
00:21:22,008 --> 00:21:24,708
Killed the <i>kaffirs</i>
because I chose to.

331
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,877
Exercised my free will to do it,

332
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:28,682
<i>enjoyed</i> it.

333
00:21:30,816 --> 00:21:32,949
So don't you come in here

334
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:34,485
with your fucking cross

335
00:21:34,487 --> 00:21:36,620
pretending you can love me.

336
00:21:36,622 --> 00:21:39,156
You swear...

337
00:21:39,158 --> 00:21:41,191
too much.

338
00:21:41,193 --> 00:21:43,694
Too right, my bru.

339
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:45,962
But now I'm inside your head,

340
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:47,465
staring right back at you

341
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:50,500
every time you look
in the mirror.

342
00:21:50,502 --> 00:21:51,835
Hatred,

343
00:21:51,837 --> 00:21:53,973
always in you, from now on.

344
00:21:56,142 --> 00:21:57,978
I'm right aren't I, <i>kaffir?</i>

345
00:22:02,148 --> 00:22:05,516
Brutality is the aberration,

346
00:22:05,518 --> 00:22:08,087
Mr. Blomfeld, not love.

347
00:22:09,154 --> 00:22:11,154
Think on that,

348
00:22:11,156 --> 00:22:12,723
no matter...

349
00:22:12,725 --> 00:22:14,961
how uncomfortable
it may make you feel.

350
00:22:40,018 --> 00:22:41,555
Thank you, Sergeant.

351
00:22:48,794 --> 00:22:49,796
Thank you.

352
00:22:52,297 --> 00:22:53,663
Be careful.

353
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,032
He was security police.

354
00:22:55,034 --> 00:22:57,901
Some of them are.

355
00:22:57,903 --> 00:22:59,570
<i>Amandla.</i>

356
00:22:59,572 --> 00:23:00,574
<i>Amandla.</i>

357
00:23:18,257 --> 00:23:19,726
I see now what your plan is.

358
00:23:22,595 --> 00:23:23,760
Fuck you all, Schmidt.

359
00:23:23,762 --> 00:23:25,161
Open.

360
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:29,134
Open.

361
00:23:55,961 --> 00:23:58,731
There goes the
holiday in Namibia Se Poes.

362
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,066
You said all the records
was destroyed?

363
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:05,702
There was just too much.

364
00:24:05,704 --> 00:24:07,271
Nobody's going
to find out anything

365
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:09,206
if you just <i>hou jou bek.</i>

366
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,177
And that goes for you too, Mosi.

367
00:24:18,985 --> 00:24:20,383
Let me sort this out.

368
00:24:30,129 --> 00:24:32,062
How is it, Chommie?

369
00:24:32,064 --> 00:24:34,297
Long time no see.

370
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:35,668
I see you got some new friends.

371
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:40,670
Can I help?

372
00:24:40,672 --> 00:24:41,738
Yeah, take him to the toilet,

373
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,175
looks like he needs a piss.

374
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:45,976
Where is the Archbishop?

375
00:24:45,978 --> 00:24:47,844
Why?

376
00:24:47,846 --> 00:24:50,314
Because he's not playing
in the sand.

377
00:24:50,316 --> 00:24:51,617
He's busy.

378
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:56,219
It's hard work.

379
00:24:56,221 --> 00:24:58,889
You need some sun screen.

380
00:24:58,891 --> 00:25:00,090
You might have a long wait,

381
00:25:00,092 --> 00:25:02,793
the Archbishop
is seeing someone.

382
00:25:02,795 --> 00:25:04,331
Waiting is our game, lady.

383
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:07,167
Waiting's our game.

384
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,743
<i>Mrs. Morobe, Kefilwe,</i>

385
00:25:19,745 --> 00:25:23,013
<i>there must be something else
you could tell me.</i>

386
00:25:23,015 --> 00:25:26,050
Nobody see her
ever since she go.

387
00:25:26,052 --> 00:25:27,954
Nobody knows nothing.

388
00:25:29,954 --> 00:25:32,022
But Mpho did tell me

389
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:34,294
that Osiswe was afraid.

390
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,199
So, she was frightened?

391
00:25:43,201 --> 00:25:45,137
I tell her, stay in house.

392
00:25:46,238 --> 00:25:47,438
Mpho tells me,

393
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,105
"I'm not Mamparra,

394
00:25:49,107 --> 00:25:51,043
I'm not live like prisoner."

395
00:25:58,017 --> 00:25:59,018
Father,

396
00:26:00,152 --> 00:26:01,951
Mpho did tell me that Osiswe

397
00:26:01,953 --> 00:26:04,822
was in the mix
of Security Police,

398
00:26:04,824 --> 00:26:09,093
afraid of Operation
Hacksaw or something.

399
00:26:09,095 --> 00:26:10,494
Hacksaw?

400
00:26:10,496 --> 00:26:12,232
Operation Hacksaw?

401
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:15,167
Father,

402
00:26:17,135 --> 00:26:19,202
I'm begging you, Father,

403
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:22,005
please!

404
00:26:22,007 --> 00:26:25,409
Find me just one piece of bone

405
00:26:25,411 --> 00:26:27,244
so I can make

406
00:26:27,246 --> 00:26:29,883
a decent burial for my girl.

407
00:26:32,284 --> 00:26:33,286
I promise,

408
00:26:34,452 --> 00:26:35,454
Mrs. Morobe,

409
00:26:37,189 --> 00:26:39,292
I promise.
Thank you.

410
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:54,071
Officer.
Good morning, Archbishop.

411
00:26:54,073 --> 00:26:55,805
Excuse me, Your Grace.

412
00:26:55,807 --> 00:26:57,039
I just want to ask him
a question.

413
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:58,241
It's okay.
Okay.

414
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:00,043
Can I ask you a question?

415
00:27:00,045 --> 00:27:02,880
It's about loyalty.

416
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:04,448
Sir,

417
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:08,185
you served your country
for 30 years,

418
00:27:08,187 --> 00:27:10,554
loyally,

419
00:27:10,556 --> 00:27:12,855
then you witch-hunted.

420
00:27:12,857 --> 00:27:14,925
That's <i>kak,</i> no?

421
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:17,326
This is not a witch hunt.

422
00:27:17,328 --> 00:27:19,529
Thank you, Officer.

423
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:23,167
Excuse me, sir,
Your Grace, just...

424
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:25,035
I was just wondering.

425
00:27:25,037 --> 00:27:27,239
Do you people think
you're better than us?

426
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:32,476
And the reason I say that
is because,

427
00:27:32,478 --> 00:27:34,277
let's say going forward,

428
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,846
we get a really <i>kak</i> president

429
00:27:36,848 --> 00:27:38,951
and those are our bodies
buried there.

430
00:27:40,553 --> 00:27:42,218
Will you still be digging us out

431
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,555
and crying about reconciliation?

432
00:27:45,557 --> 00:27:48,057
I pray we will.

433
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:49,258
I believe we will.
Yeah,

434
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,195
but you can't guarantee it,
can you?

435
00:27:51,197 --> 00:27:53,863
Thank you, officer.
Excuse me.

436
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:55,498
Listen, lady,
I am an officer of the law,

437
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,034
I can ask him what I'd like.

438
00:27:57,036 --> 00:27:58,235
Excuse me, Your Grace,
I'd like to ask you

439
00:27:58,237 --> 00:27:59,439
one more question.

440
00:28:01,873 --> 00:28:04,309
You tell me,
what good is any of this?

441
00:28:06,444 --> 00:28:10,881
What's... What's buried
should stay buried.

442
00:28:10,883 --> 00:28:12,048
The only thing

443
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,851
that will stay buried

444
00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:15,052
is anger

445
00:28:15,054 --> 00:28:17,153
and resentment.

446
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:19,288
Don't think you don't need us
on your side,

447
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,356
that's all I'm saying.

448
00:28:20,358 --> 00:28:22,292
There are no sides,

449
00:28:22,294 --> 00:28:25,161
we are one nation now.

450
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:26,132
One nation?

451
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,633
Hell, we're all going to be
covered in gold

452
00:28:30,635 --> 00:28:33,003
at the end of this rainbow.

453
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:35,371
Good day, officer.

454
00:28:35,373 --> 00:28:37,373
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

455
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:38,875
It's okay. It's okay.

456
00:28:38,877 --> 00:28:40,544
No, they've got nothing on us...

457
00:28:40,546 --> 00:28:42,112
It's a <i>klomp kak.</i>

458
00:28:42,114 --> 00:28:44,517
We just need to keep quiet,
keep our mouths shut.

459
00:28:46,317 --> 00:28:47,586
Mosi, come.

460
00:29:21,987 --> 00:29:23,890
So many secrets.

461
00:29:25,123 --> 00:29:27,623
It's like a cancer.

462
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:31,495
Is it that evil creature
in Pollsmoor?

463
00:29:31,497 --> 00:29:34,300
Don't let him inside,
you hear me?

464
00:29:36,335 --> 00:29:39,236
If I'm the only person
that he's inside,

465
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:41,874
then it wouldn't be so bad.

466
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:47,076
Note to self then, Archbishop,

467
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:49,545
don't go back into Pollsmoor.

468
00:29:49,547 --> 00:29:52,349
You hear me?

469
00:29:52,351 --> 00:29:54,150
Vinnie, can you...

470
00:29:54,152 --> 00:29:56,486
can you get Oliver
or one of our researchers

471
00:29:56,488 --> 00:29:58,956
to look and to give me
information

472
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:02,428
on this secret operation
called "Hacksaw"?

473
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:05,398
Okay.

474
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:29,655
Huh?
Of course, sir.

475
00:30:32,758 --> 00:30:33,960
Huh, do you?

476
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:22,975
What do you advise me?

477
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:34,517
Why Mogomat?

478
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,285
Yes, Benjamin's a bitch.

479
00:32:38,851 --> 00:32:40,053
You a wife.

480
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,719
He's the general's wife.

481
00:32:53,498 --> 00:32:55,599
Please explain to us

482
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:58,604
the purpose of the SSA.

483
00:33:00,706 --> 00:33:03,509
The SSA, Security police,

484
00:33:05,611 --> 00:33:07,713
its purpose was to extract
information.

485
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:11,680
We were told to keep it clean,

486
00:33:11,682 --> 00:33:12,684
but, uh...

487
00:33:15,586 --> 00:33:16,820
Go on,

488
00:33:16,822 --> 00:33:18,554
Mr. Xhosa.

489
00:33:18,556 --> 00:33:22,359
Torture included
the punching of genitals

490
00:33:22,361 --> 00:33:25,294
until blood came, and pus.

491
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,671
Electric rods in vaginas.

492
00:33:38,876 --> 00:33:39,878
Sorry.

493
00:33:43,582 --> 00:33:45,548
Does the name...

494
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,484
Mpho Morobe

495
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:49,122
mean anything to you?

496
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:54,925
No.

497
00:33:54,927 --> 00:33:58,227
What about operation Hacksaw?

498
00:33:58,229 --> 00:34:00,296
Mr. Chairman,

499
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:02,932
I must interrupt this witness.
I have here

500
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:05,869
a High Court order of <i>sub judice</i>

501
00:34:05,871 --> 00:34:07,938
that forbids further testimony
of this witness.

502
00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:21,650
Really?

503
00:34:21,652 --> 00:34:22,654
Alex.

504
00:34:28,794 --> 00:34:29,795
Colonel,

505
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:33,429
do you have nothing to say

506
00:34:33,431 --> 00:34:35,732
to these families?

507
00:34:35,734 --> 00:34:38,435
To David Lyon's family

508
00:34:38,437 --> 00:34:39,902
or...

509
00:34:39,904 --> 00:34:42,542
Simba Goniwe's family.

510
00:34:44,475 --> 00:34:47,544
Families who have had no news

511
00:34:47,546 --> 00:34:50,679
of their beloved son

512
00:34:50,681 --> 00:34:53,750
or their adored husband

513
00:34:53,752 --> 00:34:54,854
for years.

514
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:02,491
Do you have nothing to say

515
00:35:02,493 --> 00:35:05,297
that would ease their pain?

516
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:09,899
That might give them...

517
00:35:09,901 --> 00:35:11,768
closure?

518
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,941
I will say only this,
Archbishop,

519
00:35:16,008 --> 00:35:18,607
we were fighting a war

520
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:20,710
against communism.

521
00:35:20,712 --> 00:35:23,946
I was battling a threat
to us all.

522
00:35:23,948 --> 00:35:25,547
Communist regimes,

523
00:35:25,549 --> 00:35:27,783
harsh, repressive regimes,

524
00:35:27,785 --> 00:35:30,488
intent on making Africa theirs.

525
00:35:36,495 --> 00:35:37,763
Colonel,

526
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:42,966
look at the faces

527
00:35:42,968 --> 00:35:45,270
of these families.

528
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:52,277
They are your own people!

529
00:35:57,982 --> 00:35:59,852
Colonel, you cannot change

530
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:04,053
what is over

531
00:36:04,055 --> 00:36:06,625
or where you have been,

532
00:36:08,093 --> 00:36:10,426
but you can change

533
00:36:10,428 --> 00:36:12,998
where you now go.

534
00:36:14,832 --> 00:36:16,565
Mr. Chairman,

535
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:19,035
I have lodged a complaint
with the Public Protector

536
00:36:19,037 --> 00:36:21,471
to have a declaration
that this proceeding

537
00:36:21,473 --> 00:36:24,873
is a politically motivated slur

538
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:27,377
against my client's
honor and integrity,

539
00:36:27,379 --> 00:36:29,015
and that of the SADF.

540
00:36:30,114 --> 00:36:31,549
Really, son?

541
00:36:35,787 --> 00:36:37,786
This farrago...

542
00:36:37,788 --> 00:36:39,955
is alienating a large sector

543
00:36:39,957 --> 00:36:41,824
of white South Africa.

544
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:43,859
Now, if that was your intention,

545
00:36:43,861 --> 00:36:45,527
you have achieved it.

546
00:36:45,529 --> 00:36:47,696
And I do not see
how this furthers the aim

547
00:36:47,698 --> 00:36:51,000
of peace and reconciliation.

548
00:37:09,754 --> 00:37:11,120
Everyone,

549
00:37:11,122 --> 00:37:13,992
we are taking
a five-minute break, please.

550
00:37:26,671 --> 00:37:28,705
Mrs. Morobe,

551
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:30,440
Kefilwe,

552
00:37:30,442 --> 00:37:33,442
what are you still doing here?

553
00:37:33,444 --> 00:37:37,045
We're just sitting.

554
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,714
See,

555
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:41,016
tomorrow, Mpho is turning 20.

556
00:37:41,018 --> 00:37:43,089
I have candles to light.

557
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:45,991
Twenty.

558
00:37:47,091 --> 00:37:49,024
You should go home.

559
00:37:49,026 --> 00:37:51,694
When I get news of Mpho,

560
00:37:51,696 --> 00:37:54,797
I will tell you, I promise.

561
00:37:54,799 --> 00:37:56,533
Oh, she was...

562
00:37:56,535 --> 00:37:58,935
always wanting to study.

563
00:37:58,937 --> 00:38:00,839
Perhaps to be a doctor.

564
00:38:02,473 --> 00:38:04,908
She always saved for books.

565
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:05,975
Yes.

566
00:38:05,977 --> 00:38:07,645
Kefilwe knows.

567
00:38:13,551 --> 00:38:15,653
How can I pray for her

568
00:38:17,721 --> 00:38:19,725
if I don't know what happened?

569
00:38:33,171 --> 00:38:37,207
Good evening.
So how did it go?

570
00:38:37,209 --> 00:38:38,808
Interesting.

571
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,910
Well, I see you won't come in
for your cocoa,

572
00:38:40,912 --> 00:38:42,478
so I come out here.

573
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,913
Good night.

574
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:50,219
This music always reminds me

575
00:38:50,221 --> 00:38:53,459
of President Mandela's
inauguration.

576
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:55,958
I played it for them.

577
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,261
They wanted to know
about that day.

578
00:38:59,263 --> 00:39:02,165
But how do you convey it,

579
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:04,801
that sense of freedom?

580
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:08,237
That, uh, that first moment,

581
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,772
the taste of it.

582
00:39:09,774 --> 00:39:13,176
That sweet, sweet nectar.

583
00:39:13,178 --> 00:39:16,145
How do you convey it

584
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:18,982
to someone who was born

585
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:20,250
into freedom?

586
00:39:20,252 --> 00:39:22,618
You can't. You can't.

587
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,254
Oh, my dear, drink your cocoa,

588
00:39:24,256 --> 00:39:25,723
it's getting cold.

589
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:30,062
Remember...

590
00:39:31,696 --> 00:39:33,562
those jets

591
00:39:33,564 --> 00:39:36,065
flying overhead,

592
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:37,799
streaming smoke

593
00:39:37,801 --> 00:39:41,506
in the colors
of the new national flag

594
00:39:42,573 --> 00:39:43,741
and...

595
00:39:44,975 --> 00:39:48,277
everybody cheering.

596
00:39:48,279 --> 00:39:50,547
Yes. And you dancing

597
00:39:50,549 --> 00:39:52,815
with that fat white businessman

598
00:39:52,817 --> 00:39:54,152
like two seals.

599
00:39:55,587 --> 00:39:57,286
He wasn't a businessman.

600
00:39:57,288 --> 00:39:59,091
That's what I was telling them.

601
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:02,926
He was Nelson Mandela's...

602
00:40:02,928 --> 00:40:06,062
ex-jailer.

603
00:40:06,064 --> 00:40:09,701
And we were dancing because...

604
00:40:11,669 --> 00:40:14,904
those jets flying overhead,

605
00:40:14,906 --> 00:40:16,075
they were ours.

606
00:40:17,576 --> 00:40:19,078
Not someone else's.

607
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,815
Ours.

608
00:40:24,248 --> 00:40:25,951
We were free.

609
00:40:28,752 --> 00:40:31,120
I hope we don't let
this slip away.

610
00:40:31,122 --> 00:40:32,258
Oh, no.

611
00:40:35,259 --> 00:40:37,859
And what is it you were really
thinking about out here,

612
00:40:37,861 --> 00:40:40,029
my dear workaholic?

613
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:41,634
Hmm?

614
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:46,902
Mrs. Morobe
and her niece

615
00:40:46,904 --> 00:40:49,674
have been waiting
at the Commission

616
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:53,208
every day this week.

617
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:56,114
I... promised.

618
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,683
Mpilo,

619
00:41:00,685 --> 00:41:03,819
with your illness,

620
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:05,989
you know I've had mixed feelings

621
00:41:05,991 --> 00:41:08,123
about you continuing
the chairmanship.

622
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:10,326
Huh? What?

623
00:41:10,328 --> 00:41:11,960
Why didn't you tell me before?

624
00:41:11,962 --> 00:41:14,663
Oh, Desmond Mpilo Tutu,
you are incorrigible.

625
00:41:14,665 --> 00:41:16,966
There's still some life

626
00:41:16,968 --> 00:41:18,835
in this old goat yet then, huh?

627
00:41:18,837 --> 00:41:21,904
And I know it's important
for Mrs. Morobe,

628
00:41:21,906 --> 00:41:24,073
for all of us,

629
00:41:24,075 --> 00:41:26,274
this Blomfeld man.

630
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:28,176
Lavinia wants me
to get you to promise

631
00:41:28,178 --> 00:41:29,911
never to see him again.

632
00:41:29,913 --> 00:41:32,080
She says he's very dangerous.

633
00:41:32,082 --> 00:41:34,750
She showed me his letter.

634
00:41:34,752 --> 00:41:37,786
God knows what goes in his head.

635
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:40,156
He's very clever.

636
00:41:40,158 --> 00:41:42,391
That doesn't mean that
he should get the last word.

637
00:41:42,393 --> 00:41:44,761
Yes, which is exactly why

638
00:41:44,763 --> 00:41:47,196
I asked Varney
to get you his file.

639
00:41:47,198 --> 00:41:48,933
Know your adversary.

640
00:41:54,406 --> 00:41:56,105
You read this?

641
00:41:56,107 --> 00:41:57,610
Twice.

642
00:42:05,015 --> 00:42:07,352
Leah Nomalizo Shenxane.

643
00:42:10,422 --> 00:42:12,054
We've been married so long,

644
00:42:12,056 --> 00:42:14,290
I don't even remember...

645
00:42:14,292 --> 00:42:16,324
how long.

646
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:18,897
But every day,

647
00:42:19,997 --> 00:42:21,899
you surprise me more...

648
00:42:23,067 --> 00:42:24,370
and more.

649
00:42:26,203 --> 00:42:28,437
Come, come.

650
00:42:28,439 --> 00:42:29,705
Go over to the goat.

651
00:42:32,477 --> 00:42:34,379
Oh. Yes.

652
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,335
What do you advise me?

653
00:43:08,846 --> 00:43:10,049
Salute!

654
00:43:12,917 --> 00:43:14,119
Salute.

655
00:43:38,343 --> 00:43:40,446
Salute.
Salute!

656
00:44:24,388 --> 00:44:25,453
Salute.

657
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:26,522
Salute!

658
00:44:26,524 --> 00:44:27,859
Salute.

659
00:44:47,011 --> 00:44:48,080
Blomfeld!

660
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:56,120
You like my wall, Kruger?

661
00:44:57,288 --> 00:44:59,388
Yeah, I like it.

662
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:01,857
The <i>kaffirs</i> are up to something.

663
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:05,094
You should take the <i>kaffirs</i>
down a peg.

664
00:45:06,064 --> 00:45:08,399
You know what
"Paradise Lost" is, Kruger?

665
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:12,033
A nightclub?

666
00:45:12,035 --> 00:45:15,203
It's a poem, you clutch plate,

667
00:45:15,205 --> 00:45:16,441
about me.

668
00:45:21,145 --> 00:45:23,078
Fuck you.

669
00:46:02,553 --> 00:46:04,189
Aaah!

670
00:46:19,937 --> 00:46:21,270
Down!
Get down.

671
00:46:21,272 --> 00:46:23,575
Get the fuck down, you fuckers!

672
00:46:26,944 --> 00:46:28,013
Down!

673
00:46:30,047 --> 00:46:31,216
Down!

674
00:46:32,716 --> 00:46:35,119
Down. Now.

675
00:46:38,388 --> 00:46:40,121
Do you want a fucking lockdown,

676
00:46:40,123 --> 00:46:42,390
you animals?
No, sir!

677
00:46:42,392 --> 00:46:44,292
Are there rules
here, you bastards?

678
00:46:44,294 --> 00:46:46,228
Yes, sir!

679
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,096
Whose fucking rules are they?

680
00:46:48,098 --> 00:46:49,165
Yours, sir!

681
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:50,433
Whose fucking rules are they?

682
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:51,500
Yours, sir!

683
00:46:51,502 --> 00:46:52,600
Don't you forget it.

684
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:54,136
No, sir!

685
00:46:54,138 --> 00:46:55,471
Salute

686
00:46:55,473 --> 00:46:56,705
Salute!

687
00:46:58,542 --> 00:47:00,643
You're a man now, Idukwe.

688
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,080
<i>Ex-President F.W. de Klerk</i>

689
00:47:05,082 --> 00:47:07,716
<i>started off with
what Desmond Tutu later called</i>

690
00:47:07,718 --> 00:47:09,352
<i>a handsome apology.</i>

691
00:47:09,354 --> 00:47:12,654
<i>Apartheid was wrong.</i>

692
00:47:12,656 --> 00:47:14,757
<i>I apologize in my capacity</i>

693
00:47:14,759 --> 00:47:17,759
<i>as leader of the National Party</i>

694
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:20,529
<i>to the millions

695
00:47:20,531 --> 00:47:23,431
<i>who suffered

696
00:47:23,433 --> 00:47:24,500

00:47:32,509 --> 00:47:33,641
<i>for pass law offenses.</i>

702
00:47:33,643 --> 00:47:35,544
Hansie?

703
00:47:35,546 --> 00:47:37,145
What?

704
00:47:37,147 --> 00:47:39,448
The fete, Melissa's school fete.

705
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:40,451
You should come.

706
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,185
They'll wonder why
you aren't there.

707
00:47:44,187 --> 00:47:45,587
<i>Who for a long time were...</i>

708
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:48,324
Sanette and Jan are coming.

709
00:47:48,326 --> 00:47:51,396
I told them we'd all go
for a <i>braai</i> with the kids.

710
00:47:52,629 --> 00:47:53,731
A <i>braai.</i>

711
00:47:55,466 --> 00:47:57,234
Yeah, let's go for a <i>braai.</i>

712
00:48:00,705 --> 00:48:02,804
I'll say this for those blacks,

713
00:48:02,806 --> 00:48:05,076
at least their leaders
stand by their men.

714
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:09,478
<i>To the millions

00:48:27,598 --> 00:48:29,632
<i>suffered the indignities

723

<i>of racial discrimination.</i>

724
00:48:31,602 --> 00:48:33,669
<i>The head of the ANC's legal department,</i>

725
00:48:33,671 --> 00:48:35,837
<i>Matthews Phosa,

726
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,772
<i>that de Klerk sat in Pretoria</i>

727

<i>and knew everything that went on</i>

00:48:40,078 --> 00:48:43,078
<i>in the ANC's Quattro camp
in faraway Angola,</i>

729
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,017
<i>but nothing about Vlakplaas...</i>

730
00:49:18,683 --> 00:49:20,549
So, you're back, huh?

731
00:49:20,551 --> 00:49:22,054
Glutton for it, are we?

732
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:28,759
So you have whipped that pig de Klerk.
So what?

733
00:49:30,895 --> 00:49:32,694
So,

734
00:49:32,696 --> 00:49:35,431
we are living in Technicolor.

735
00:49:35,433 --> 00:49:38,567
Now they are saying
that it's time for

736
00:49:38,569 --> 00:49:40,569
the rainbow nation

737
00:49:40,571 --> 00:49:41,803
to unite.

738
00:49:41,805 --> 00:49:44,172
That's what they're saying,
is it?

739
00:49:44,174 --> 00:49:45,440
You, white boy in Hout Bay,

740
00:49:45,442 --> 00:49:47,442
with an up and under
behind the door?

741
00:49:47,444 --> 00:49:49,444
Terre Blanche and the AWB.

742
00:49:49,446 --> 00:49:51,346
You Green and Golds, is it?

743
00:49:51,348 --> 00:49:54,315
Shit, man, that is buffalo dung.

744
00:49:54,317 --> 00:49:56,754
You know, Mr. Blomfeld,

745
00:49:58,256 --> 00:50:01,924
when I left here last time,

746
00:50:01,926 --> 00:50:04,792
I didn't just even think,

747
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:08,163
"Well...
that's that.

748
00:50:08,165 --> 00:50:09,366
It's over."

749
00:50:10,801 --> 00:50:12,433
I have fully,

750
00:50:12,435 --> 00:50:15,707
fully investigated your case.

751
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:18,376
And?

752
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:21,680
And...

753
00:50:22,946 --> 00:50:25,883
amnesty for your crimes

754
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,688
is highly unlikely.

755
00:50:31,622 --> 00:50:34,355
You showed your victims

756
00:50:34,357 --> 00:50:35,790
no mercy,

757
00:50:35,792 --> 00:50:39,795
and besides the...

758
00:50:39,797 --> 00:50:41,867
extreme brutality,

759
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:45,667
your crimes reveal

760
00:50:45,669 --> 00:50:48,873
no political context.

761
00:50:53,477 --> 00:50:55,680
No political context?

762
00:50:57,647 --> 00:50:59,248
My context,

763
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,882
as you call it,

764
00:51:00,884 --> 00:51:04,819
stretches back some 300 years.

765
00:51:04,821 --> 00:51:07,355
When my ancestors
were farming this land

766
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:09,991
and building its cities,

767
00:51:09,993 --> 00:51:12,361
yours were creeping out
of the bush,

768
00:51:12,363 --> 00:51:13,797
trying to murder them.

769
00:51:15,332 --> 00:51:16,799
That's context.

770
00:51:16,801 --> 00:51:20,471
My people were murdered
by yours.

771
00:51:21,538 --> 00:51:23,806
In Zimbabwe.
Yes, I know.

772
00:51:23,808 --> 00:51:25,841
Zimbabwe, South Africa?
Same difference.

773
00:51:25,843 --> 00:51:27,710
Is it?
Is it the same?

774
00:51:27,712 --> 00:51:29,511
I don't know.
You're the expert on context.

775
00:51:29,513 --> 00:51:30,681
You tell me.

776
00:51:34,752 --> 00:51:36,919
Your people

777
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:41,660
Believed in this...

778
00:51:43,526 --> 00:51:45,629
this little subversive book.

779
00:51:47,931 --> 00:51:50,632
It's a beautiful little book.

780
00:51:50,634 --> 00:51:52,370
It's my favorite,

781
00:51:54,372 --> 00:51:57,038
which teaches us,

782
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,741
"Proclaim liberty

783
00:51:59,743 --> 00:52:02,411
to the captive,

784
00:52:02,413 --> 00:52:05,717
sight to the blind

785
00:52:07,417 --> 00:52:12,756
and to set
the oppressed free."

786
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:16,860
That's in Luke 4:18.

787
00:52:19,997 --> 00:52:22,998
Your people...

788
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,900
felt they were being oppressed

789
00:52:25,902 --> 00:52:27,305
by the British,

790
00:52:29,573 --> 00:52:31,739
they fought back

791
00:52:31,741 --> 00:52:33,544
and they became free.

792
00:52:35,578 --> 00:52:38,379
So you need to learn

793
00:52:38,381 --> 00:52:40,882
from your own history

794
00:52:40,884 --> 00:52:43,419
that when a people

795
00:52:43,421 --> 00:52:47,325
decide to be free,

796
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:52,330
my dear friend, nothing,

797
00:52:53,763 --> 00:52:57,899
absolutely nothing

798
00:52:57,901 --> 00:53:00,271
is gonna stop them
from becoming free.

799
00:53:06,343 --> 00:53:08,609
Yes. Very good.

800
00:53:08,611 --> 00:53:11,413
Very high-minded of you.

801
00:53:11,415 --> 00:53:14,716
But there's something
you just don't get, <i>kaffir.</i>

802
00:53:14,718 --> 00:53:18,520
Something you just do not get.

803
00:53:18,522 --> 00:53:21,824
Killing someone
is never political,

804
00:53:21,826 --> 00:53:24,893
no matter what anyone says.

805
00:53:24,895 --> 00:53:27,998
Killing someone is personal.

806
00:53:30,801 --> 00:53:33,837
It's always, always personal.

807
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,942
It's simple.

808
00:53:40,611 --> 00:53:42,944
You like to read, eh?

809
00:53:42,946 --> 00:53:45,748
Study on this,

810
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:48,484
"Unconquerable will,

811
00:53:48,486 --> 00:53:50,386
study of revenge,

812
00:53:50,388 --> 00:53:52,920
immortal hate,

813
00:53:52,922 --> 00:53:55,623
courage to never submit
or yield,

814
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:58,430
what else is not to be overcome?

815
00:54:00,029 --> 00:54:02,029
Better to reign in Hell

816
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:04,098
than to serve in Heaven."

817
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,803
Lucifer.

818
00:54:08,004 --> 00:54:10,040
You quoted that poem
in your letter.

819
00:54:14,578 --> 00:54:16,779
So papa was a teacher,
so I'm assuming he knows

820
00:54:16,781 --> 00:54:19,351
it's "Paradise Lost."

821
00:54:21,151 --> 00:54:23,018
And if you don't,
you're just one more

822
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,358
half-educated <i>mzee</i>
in my eyes.

823
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,560
You're a dreamer, my old Hotnot.

824
00:54:31,562 --> 00:54:32,960
I grant you that.

825
00:54:32,962 --> 00:54:35,129
A fucking dreamer.

826
00:54:35,131 --> 00:54:36,498
Dreamer?

827
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,535
Yes.

828
00:54:39,002 --> 00:54:42,804
I, for 40 years,

829
00:54:42,806 --> 00:54:45,940
I dreamed of voting...

830
00:54:45,942 --> 00:54:49,210
freely in a free country

831
00:54:49,212 --> 00:54:51,712
in the land of my birth.

832
00:54:51,714 --> 00:54:55,386
For 40 years,
I've been in the wilderness.

833
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,658
Now, it's finally come to pass.

834
00:55:05,529 --> 00:55:09,598
There was this one
neutralization

835
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,732
and I was standing there
on this <i>stoep</i>

836
00:55:11,734 --> 00:55:15,536
covered in <i>kaffir</i> brain,
and blood, and shit.

837
00:55:15,538 --> 00:55:16,939
My old head was throbbing

838
00:55:16,941 --> 00:55:20,007
<i>like</i> babelaas...

839
00:55:20,009 --> 00:55:22,647
<i>and after the killings,
we set a fire.</i>

840
00:55:24,747 --> 00:55:26,915
And I could hear this voice
inside my head

841
00:55:26,917 --> 00:55:29,917
as clear as you're
hearing me now,

842
00:55:29,919 --> 00:55:33,020
telling me I had no dreams,

843
00:55:33,022 --> 00:55:36,658
no passion, no hope.

844
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:41,496
"What is life without
them things?" it asked me.

845
00:55:41,498 --> 00:55:44,565
"I have passion, I have dreams."

846
00:55:44,567 --> 00:55:47,502
I remember shouting back.

847
00:55:47,504 --> 00:55:49,504
And all the boys were there,

848
00:55:49,506 --> 00:55:53,040
Francois, Hansie,
all the Hacksaw boys,

849
00:55:53,042 --> 00:55:54,643
<i>they were watching me
through the flames.</i>

850
00:55:54,645 --> 00:55:56,681
<i>The whole time that voice,</i>

851
00:55:57,982 --> 00:56:00,582
"What dreams, what dreams?"

852
00:56:00,584 --> 00:56:02,152
I had dreams!

853
00:56:05,055 --> 00:56:08,257
I had dreams once, I did.

854
00:56:08,259 --> 00:56:12,197
But you fucking people,
you stole them from me.

855
00:56:19,102 --> 00:56:23,071
How... How old...

856
00:56:23,073 --> 00:56:26,908
were you when you
joined the AWB?

857
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:30,846
What the fuck is that
got to do with anything?

858
00:56:30,848 --> 00:56:34,015
How old?

859
00:56:34,017 --> 00:56:35,220
Seventeen.

860
00:56:37,087 --> 00:56:40,091
And what has it got
you, Mr. Blomfeld,

861
00:56:44,194 --> 00:56:47,962
33 years of hate?

862
00:56:47,964 --> 00:56:49,998
Fuck you.

863
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,567
It's too much for you, isn't it?

864
00:56:51,569 --> 00:56:52,900
The Commission?

865
00:56:52,902 --> 00:56:55,303
That's plain enough.

866
00:56:55,305 --> 00:56:57,940
I didn't come here
to discuss The Commission.

867
00:56:57,942 --> 00:57:01,208
You can't forgive
the likes of me.

868
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:04,948
Breaking your faith,
isn't it, eh?

869
00:57:06,649 --> 00:57:09,850
I have watched the light
of life flicker out and die

870
00:57:09,852 --> 00:57:12,187
behind the eyes of so many
I have done.

871
00:57:12,189 --> 00:57:15,593
That is cock-stiffening,
I can tell you.

872
00:57:18,895 --> 00:57:22,633
I have ministered to the dying,

873
00:57:23,968 --> 00:57:26,904
and I'm no stranger to death.

874
00:57:28,339 --> 00:57:30,172
First, when the knife goes in,

875
00:57:30,174 --> 00:57:31,940
they just don't believe it.

876
00:57:31,942 --> 00:57:33,545
They are in shock.

877
00:57:35,312 --> 00:57:37,145
Then is coming acceptance.

878
00:57:37,147 --> 00:57:39,714
Oh, yeah.

879
00:57:39,716 --> 00:57:43,018
They are grateful, aren't they?

880
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,721
Sometimes I feel I can almost

881
00:57:45,723 --> 00:57:48,890
hear them whispering,

882
00:57:48,892 --> 00:57:52,227
"Thank you,

883
00:57:52,229 --> 00:57:53,698
thank you."

884
00:57:57,634 --> 00:58:00,234
So don't you come in here
and pontificate,

885
00:58:00,236 --> 00:58:03,337
you self-righteous doff.

886
00:58:03,339 --> 00:58:05,873
TRC has broken you inside,

887
00:58:05,875 --> 00:58:08,910
made the sham of your faith.

888
00:58:08,912 --> 00:58:11,178
I'm right, aren't I?

889
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,015
You can't forgive the beasts

890
00:58:13,017 --> 00:58:16,718
that you confront every day.

891
00:58:18,888 --> 00:58:20,888
That cancer is eating you alive.

892
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:22,790
You are so finished, boy.

893
00:58:22,792 --> 00:58:26,661
Don't you call me "boy"
again, Blomfeld.

894
00:58:26,663 --> 00:58:28,066
Or what?

895
00:58:41,377 --> 00:58:43,146
Under your mask...

896
00:58:47,216 --> 00:58:50,085
you're riddled

897
00:58:50,087 --> 00:58:51,889
with self-loathing.

898
00:59:07,471 --> 00:59:10,074
Easier to...

899
00:59:13,076 --> 00:59:17,045
to be angry at the world

900
00:59:17,047 --> 00:59:19,417
than to be angry at yourself.

901
00:59:21,785 --> 00:59:23,120
I understand.

902
00:59:33,096 --> 00:59:35,864
When they arrested you,

903
00:59:35,866 --> 00:59:38,136
you had this on you.

904
00:59:42,473 --> 00:59:44,839
You hung onto it

905
00:59:44,841 --> 00:59:47,912
for 40 years.

906
00:59:49,312 --> 00:59:50,448
Why?

907
01:00:01,225 --> 01:00:02,393
Visit's over.

908
01:00:04,995 --> 01:00:06,163
What happened?

909
01:00:08,397 --> 01:00:10,364
And don't hide behind

910
01:00:10,366 --> 01:00:13,970
Aristotle, or Plato, or Milton.

911
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,038
You're right,

912
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,908
you're right.

913
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:24,078
I have to stare in the mirror

914
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,984
at myself every day,

915
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:33,423
and so do you.

916
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,326
And you're not... you're not...

917
01:00:38,328 --> 01:00:41,529
you're not a fallen angel

918
01:00:41,531 --> 01:00:43,800
and I'm not God.

919
01:00:44,935 --> 01:00:48,439
We're both just men.

920
01:00:54,511 --> 01:00:55,913
One question...

921
01:00:58,948 --> 01:01:00,915
what do you know

922
01:01:00,917 --> 01:01:05,323
about this Operation Hacksaw?

923
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:16,233
I said, visit's over, <i>kaffir.</i>

924
01:01:22,906 --> 01:01:25,073
You are locked inside

925
01:01:25,075 --> 01:01:27,310
two prisons, Blomfeld.

926
01:01:28,979 --> 01:01:32,179
One is made of concrete

927
01:01:32,181 --> 01:01:35,417
and barbed wire.

928
01:01:35,419 --> 01:01:38,587
The other one

929
01:01:38,589 --> 01:01:41,121
is worse

930
01:01:41,123 --> 01:01:44,328
because it's there in your head.

931
01:01:47,564 --> 01:01:51,502
"The mind in its own place,

932
01:01:52,636 --> 01:01:55,203
and in itself,

933
01:01:55,205 --> 01:01:58,105
can make a heaven of hell,

934
01:01:58,107 --> 01:02:01,879
or a hell of heaven."

935
01:02:05,948 --> 01:02:07,350
That's Milton.

936
01:02:08,986 --> 01:02:11,419
So, if you're going to read him,

937
01:02:11,421 --> 01:02:12,620
don't cherry-pick.

938
01:02:12,622 --> 01:02:16,960
You must read him properly.

939
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:34,442
What the fuck is that?

940
01:02:34,444 --> 01:02:38,382
That is your way out of prison.

941
01:02:40,149 --> 01:02:44,551
That could be a way out

942
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:48,325
of your personal hell.

943
01:03:04,006 --> 01:03:08,111
Come out, Blomfeld.

944
01:03:10,013 --> 01:03:11,315
Come out.

945
01:03:12,381 --> 01:03:14,184
Don't stay there.

946
01:03:16,652 --> 01:03:18,955
God is waiting for you.

947
01:03:20,723 --> 01:03:22,426
Come out.

948
01:03:48,051 --> 01:03:50,453
<i>He quoted Milton at me.</i>

949
01:03:53,122 --> 01:03:55,025
I lost my temper.

950
01:04:01,631 --> 01:04:07,234
But he knows about Hacksaw,

951
01:04:07,236 --> 01:04:09,571
and whatever Hacksaw is,

952
01:04:09,573 --> 01:04:13,477
it is linked to the death
of Mpho Morobe.

953
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:30,593
Blomfeld.

954
01:04:37,466 --> 01:04:39,500
I'm thinking I go get me a beer

955
01:04:39,502 --> 01:04:42,103
when the shift is done.

956
01:04:42,105 --> 01:04:46,077
Maybe a sweet piece
of hundred-rand ass.

957
01:04:51,113 --> 01:04:52,746
Come on, bru,

958
01:04:52,748 --> 01:04:56,116
what the fuck is it between
you and that <i>kaffir?</i>

959
01:04:56,118 --> 01:04:58,353
Thinking you can sell out
and save your neck

960
01:04:58,355 --> 01:04:59,757
like the other braks?

961
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:09,230
What the <i>kaffir</i> gets
from me is medicine

962
01:05:09,232 --> 01:05:11,665
I choose to give him,
you fucking <i>poes.</i>

963
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:13,301
And understand this,

964
01:05:13,303 --> 01:05:16,471
nobody uses the word
informer about me.

965
01:05:22,379 --> 01:05:24,015
Fuck off, Francois.

966
01:05:33,689 --> 01:05:36,658
<i>I find it impossible to believe,</i>

967
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:39,627
<i>President de Klerk,
that the involvement</i>

968
01:05:39,629 --> 01:05:42,629
<i>of at least one cabinet minister</i>

969
01:05:42,631 --> 01:05:45,332
<i>and two police commissioners,</i>

970
01:05:45,334 --> 01:05:48,103
<i>in human rights violations
represents</i>

971
01:05:48,105 --> 01:05:51,839
<i>nothing more than aberrations
by mavericks,</i>

972
01:05:51,841 --> 01:05:54,808
<i>but many state-sponsored
killings</i>

973
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:56,810
<i>have been known to happen</i>

974
01:05:56,812 --> 01:05:58,245
<i>and the state has brought</i>

975
01:05:58,247 --> 01:06:01,451
<i>no senior ministers to justice.</i>

976
01:06:08,424 --> 01:06:11,461
What are you up to,
you fucking <i>kaffir?</i>

977
01:06:25,207 --> 01:06:27,774
Ha! No way,
my weaselly little <i>kaffir.</i>

978
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:30,680
No way is that shit
going to work.

979
01:07:00,877 --> 01:07:03,243
Hello, Father.

980
01:07:03,245 --> 01:07:05,513
Aunty got very sick.

981
01:07:05,515 --> 01:07:07,551
Now I don't know what to do.

982
01:07:11,254 --> 01:07:12,920
What is antimony, father?

983
01:07:12,922 --> 01:07:15,723
Antimony, some such thing,
doctors said.

984
01:07:15,725 --> 01:07:17,862
It's a poison, I'm afraid,

985
01:07:18,928 --> 01:07:20,296
it's a poison.

986
01:07:26,535 --> 01:07:28,204
You must not give up.

987
01:07:47,457 --> 01:07:48,957
What can you do?

988
01:07:48,959 --> 01:07:50,895
One man alone.

989
01:07:52,629 --> 01:07:54,498
I have a lead.

990
01:07:55,765 --> 01:07:57,734
I'm hopeful about it.

991
01:07:58,935 --> 01:08:01,536
So, please,

992
01:08:01,538 --> 01:08:03,303
don't give up hope

993
01:08:03,305 --> 01:08:05,441
and we will not give up on you.

994
01:08:07,009 --> 01:08:08,942
I did wrong.

995
01:08:13,817 --> 01:08:17,754
You made a little mistake,

996
01:08:19,623 --> 01:08:21,292
a little one.

997
01:08:28,664 --> 01:08:30,564
Sorry, Your Grace,

998
01:08:30,566 --> 01:08:33,033
there is nothing I can do,
really.

999
01:08:33,035 --> 01:08:34,602
If your name isn't on here,

1000
01:08:34,604 --> 01:08:37,005
you don't go in,
no matter who you are.

1001
01:08:37,007 --> 01:08:38,639
This is crazy.

1002
01:08:38,641 --> 01:08:40,476
Get me the governor.

1003
01:08:48,851 --> 01:08:52,287
Governor, it's imperative
that I see Mr. Blomfeld.

1004
01:08:52,289 --> 01:08:54,522
<i>Your Grace,
I have been overruled</i>

1005
01:08:54,524 --> 01:08:56,623
<i>by the Department
of Correctional Services</i>

1006
01:08:56,625 --> 01:08:57,891
<i>and there is simply nothing</i>

1007
01:08:57,893 --> 01:08:59,993
<i>I can do about it.</i>
I see.

1008
01:08:59,995 --> 01:09:01,696
<i>Good day, Your Grace.</i>

1009
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:06,336
Good day.

1010
01:09:12,007 --> 01:09:13,810
Wasted journey, huh?

1011
01:09:15,611 --> 01:09:16,743
No,

1012
01:09:16,745 --> 01:09:17,780
I got to see you.

1013
01:09:20,850 --> 01:09:21,852
Good day.

1014
01:09:23,419 --> 01:09:24,952
Howard, we need to contact

1015
01:09:24,954 --> 01:09:27,924
the Department of Correctional
Services immediately.

1016
01:09:31,561 --> 01:09:33,361
I'm sorry to be the
bearer of bad news, Arch.

1017
01:09:33,363 --> 01:09:35,563
Inkatha have issued a statement

1018
01:09:35,565 --> 01:09:36,767
to the press.

1019
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,934
It says that
the commission's findings

1020
01:09:39,936 --> 01:09:42,470
are failing
to investigate impartially,

1021
01:09:42,472 --> 01:09:44,438
that we're ANC stooges.
What?

1022
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,840
On what grounds?

1023
01:09:45,842 --> 01:09:47,574
That there is
no rational connection

1024
01:09:47,576 --> 01:09:48,710
between evidence given

1025
01:09:48,712 --> 01:09:50,111
and conclusions we draw.

1026
01:09:50,113 --> 01:09:51,778
Don't they realize the damage

1027
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:53,581
they are doing?

1028
01:09:53,583 --> 01:09:55,683
To all of us!

1029
01:09:55,685 --> 01:09:58,455
To... To... To their own...

1030
01:09:59,655 --> 01:10:01,924
people.

1031
01:10:10,033 --> 01:10:12,733
Excuse me. Can I
have you attention. Please?

1032
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:14,669
There has been a bomb threat
against the commission

1033
01:10:14,671 --> 01:10:16,738
and I'm afraid
the police have told us

1034
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:18,906
we have to cancel
today's session.

1035
01:10:18,908 --> 01:10:20,841
I'll get back to you
as soon as I can, all right?

1036
01:10:20,843 --> 01:10:23,411
Alex, the Archbishop
would love a word.

1037
01:10:23,413 --> 01:10:25,546
Please go gently on him.

1038
01:10:25,548 --> 01:10:27,114
I've never seen him so down.

1039
01:10:27,116 --> 01:10:29,953
I'll get back to you soonest.

1040
01:10:33,823 --> 01:10:35,989
Bish?

1041
01:10:35,991 --> 01:10:38,126
Bomb threat?
Good God. What's next?

1042
01:10:38,128 --> 01:10:39,626
What next?

1043
01:10:39,628 --> 01:10:41,629
What next?

1044
01:10:41,631 --> 01:10:43,430
Inkatha has made

1045
01:10:43,432 --> 01:10:46,400
a public attack

1046
01:10:46,402 --> 01:10:48,068
on the integrity

1047
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:50,738
of President Mandela himself.

1048
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:52,607
That's all we need.

1049
01:10:52,609 --> 01:10:53,944
Tribalism.

1050
01:10:56,913 --> 01:10:58,015
Bish,

1051
01:10:59,649 --> 01:11:01,648
this whole enterprise

1052
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:04,452
is in danger of collapsing,

1053
01:11:04,454 --> 01:11:05,589
isn't it?

1054
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:13,797
I don't know, Alex.

1055
01:11:16,598 --> 01:11:17,935
You tell me.

1056
01:11:21,671 --> 01:11:24,842
I just don't know.

1057
01:11:35,485 --> 01:11:37,484
My God,

1058
01:11:37,486 --> 01:11:39,823
why are you silent to me?

1059
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:44,627
Show me a sign, please?

1060
01:11:56,705 --> 01:11:57,841
Mpilo.

1061
01:12:02,912 --> 01:12:04,010
Oh, my darling.

1062
01:12:13,923 --> 01:12:16,023
Remember that time,

1063
01:12:16,025 --> 01:12:17,791
the kids wanted
to play on this beach

1064
01:12:17,793 --> 01:12:20,730
but it was whites only?

1065
01:12:22,097 --> 01:12:24,698
Uh, they wanted to swim so badly

1066
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,934
but the look on their faces,

1067
01:12:26,936 --> 01:12:29,202
I was so angry.

1068
01:12:29,204 --> 01:12:32,672
Yes, and humiliated.

1069
01:12:32,674 --> 01:12:34,143
I felt that way

1070
01:12:35,811 --> 01:12:37,545
the other day at Pollsmoor.

1071
01:12:37,547 --> 01:12:39,947
I see,

1072
01:12:39,949 --> 01:12:42,082
Pollsmoor.

1073
01:12:42,084 --> 01:12:45,886
Reminded me
of when I was a small boy,

1074
01:12:45,888 --> 01:12:48,158
walking to school
with my father,

1075
01:12:49,758 --> 01:12:52,628
crossing that white area,

1076
01:12:53,762 --> 01:12:56,296
watching my father's face

1077
01:12:56,298 --> 01:13:00,703
as he had to show
his pass to police

1078
01:13:01,971 --> 01:13:04,238
and them yelling at him

1079
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,840
and call him names.

1080
01:13:06,842 --> 01:13:09,779
And he endured it all
for my sake.

1081
01:13:11,713 --> 01:13:14,114
I just... I just...

1082
01:13:14,116 --> 01:13:16,119
I just stood there.

1083
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:20,988
I couldn't take away

1084
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:22,726
his humiliation.

1085
01:13:25,962 --> 01:13:29,132
I... I failed him.

1086
01:13:30,199 --> 01:13:33,036
Leah, I failed him.

1087
01:13:34,137 --> 01:13:37,138
Maybe that lost soul

1088
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:38,339
in Pollsmoor

1089
01:13:38,341 --> 01:13:39,676
is right.

1090
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:43,145
Maybe I'm just...

1091
01:13:44,981 --> 01:13:48,752
an... an... an old fraud...

1092
01:13:51,087 --> 01:13:54,020
delusional, and...

1093
01:13:54,022 --> 01:13:55,025
and...

1094
01:13:57,192 --> 01:13:59,093
unworthy.
Oh,

1095
01:13:59,095 --> 01:14:01,696
Mpilo, you're crazy.

1096
01:14:01,698 --> 01:14:02,763
No.

1097
01:14:02,765 --> 01:14:05,632
So what are you talking about?

1098
01:14:05,634 --> 01:14:07,367
You've spent a lifetime

1099
01:14:07,369 --> 01:14:10,037
defending the dignity of others.

1100
01:14:10,039 --> 01:14:12,907
Never to give up, never.

1101
01:14:12,909 --> 01:14:15,041
You're not going to give up now.

1102
01:14:15,043 --> 01:14:18,114
Absolutely not.

1103
01:14:21,717 --> 01:14:25,819
Yes.

1104
01:14:25,821 --> 01:14:28,558
So much hate over what?

1105
01:14:30,258 --> 01:14:32,326
Over what, huh?

1106
01:14:32,328 --> 01:14:37,063
A pigment of our imagination.
Ah.

1107
01:14:37,065 --> 01:14:41,268
Mr. Pollsmoor's completely
underestimated you,

1108
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:42,739
completely.

1109
01:15:16,338 --> 01:15:18,672
This pack,

1110
01:15:18,674 --> 01:15:20,741
plus this,

1111
01:15:20,743 --> 01:15:22,809
if you take out Blomfeld.

1112
01:15:22,811 --> 01:15:24,914
No hassle for a month
for any of your boys.

1113
01:15:26,915 --> 01:15:28,248
Why you want him dead?

1114
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:30,451
He's a fuckin' rock spider.

1115
01:15:30,453 --> 01:15:33,787
You understand,
it's good for you, him gone.

1116
01:15:33,789 --> 01:15:35,725
He wants your territory.

1117
01:15:38,794 --> 01:15:39,926
Make it soon.

1118
01:15:58,314 --> 01:16:00,781
Salute.
Salute.

1119
01:16:00,783 --> 01:16:02,185
Salute.
Salute.

1120
01:16:42,859 --> 01:16:43,927
Salute.

1121
01:16:47,997 --> 01:16:49,132
Salute.

1122
01:16:55,271 --> 01:16:56,840
Salute, salute, salute.

1123
01:19:26,955 --> 01:19:29,156
Can I help you
with something, <i>kaffir?</i>

1124
01:19:29,158 --> 01:19:32,593
You are Blomfeld?

1125
01:19:32,595 --> 01:19:34,929
What you want,

1126
01:19:34,931 --> 01:19:35,932
huh?

1127
01:19:37,065 --> 01:19:39,401
What you want?
I said.

1128
01:20:46,101 --> 01:20:47,636
This is a death knife.

1129
01:20:49,372 --> 01:20:50,703
You know what's going
to happen to you now,

1130
01:20:50,705 --> 01:20:52,438
don't you boy?
Yes, sir.

1131
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,610
What you say?!
I said, yes sir, I know.

1132
01:20:56,779 --> 01:21:00,480
You got some guts coming
over here trying to take me on.

1133
01:21:00,482 --> 01:21:02,181
What have I done to you?

1134
01:21:02,183 --> 01:21:03,250
Hmm?

1135
01:21:03,252 --> 01:21:04,684
Something from the past?

1136
01:21:04,686 --> 01:21:06,588
With your family maybe?

1137
01:21:09,091 --> 01:21:10,226
Why you do this thing?

1138
01:21:11,726 --> 01:21:14,064
I've been paid
to come and kill you.

1139
01:21:15,263 --> 01:21:16,462
Show me your marks.

1140
01:21:16,464 --> 01:21:17,797
Take your top off, fuck it!

1141
01:21:17,799 --> 01:21:19,733
I've got no marks, sir.

1142
01:21:19,735 --> 01:21:21,468
How come?

1143
01:21:21,470 --> 01:21:23,269
How come, no 28 tattoos?

1144
01:21:23,271 --> 01:21:24,975
I'm not a soldier yet.

1145
01:21:26,042 --> 01:21:28,141
I didn't think so.

1146
01:21:28,143 --> 01:21:30,109
How old are you?

1147
01:21:30,111 --> 01:21:32,179
Seventeen years, sir.

1148
01:21:32,181 --> 01:21:34,148
Seventeen?

1149
01:21:34,150 --> 01:21:36,419
So why they send you?

1150
01:21:38,354 --> 01:21:40,155
Nobody sent me.

1151
01:21:42,490 --> 01:21:44,291
Wanna be a man, eh?

1152
01:21:44,293 --> 01:21:46,693
Join the brotherhood, eh?

1153
01:21:46,695 --> 01:21:48,228
How long you're in for?

1154
01:21:48,230 --> 01:21:50,229
Four years, sir.

1155
01:21:50,231 --> 01:21:52,565
You kill me that becomes 20.

1156
01:21:52,567 --> 01:21:55,171
Is that what you want?
No, no, no, sir.

1157
01:22:01,177 --> 01:22:03,242
You're Mogomat's wifey?

1158
01:22:03,244 --> 01:22:05,180
Manservant, is that it?

1159
01:22:08,516 --> 01:22:11,417
You've fucked yourself now,
haven't you?

1160
01:22:11,419 --> 01:22:13,554
You're like a rat in a maze.

1161
01:22:13,556 --> 01:22:14,557
What's your name?

1162
01:22:16,191 --> 01:22:18,194
Mboweni, Benjamin.

1163
01:22:21,129 --> 01:22:23,132
Mboweni? You Tsonga?

1164
01:22:24,199 --> 01:22:25,599
My dad is a Tsonga.

1165
01:22:25,601 --> 01:22:27,270
He comes from Mpumalanga.

1166
01:22:35,477 --> 01:22:37,810
What they're gonna do
to you now, Benjamin?

1167
01:22:37,812 --> 01:22:39,379
They will... they will...

1168
01:22:39,381 --> 01:22:41,084
they will kill me, sir.

1169
01:22:43,619 --> 01:22:45,388
They will kill you.

1170
01:22:46,888 --> 01:22:49,355
Yes, they will.

1171
01:23:13,781 --> 01:23:15,581
I return one of your own.

1172
01:23:15,583 --> 01:23:17,283
See? Blomfeld,

1173
01:23:17,285 --> 01:23:18,618
you're taking our woman, now?

1174
01:23:20,321 --> 01:23:21,854
No, he bloodied me

1175
01:23:21,856 --> 01:23:23,657
by himself,
one-on-one.

1176
01:23:26,662 --> 01:23:29,598
Benjamin.

1177
01:23:37,673 --> 01:23:38,608
No Benjamin.

1178
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:49,819
Wait.

1179
01:24:10,772 --> 01:24:12,839
You can take me.

1180
01:24:12,841 --> 01:24:14,574
Sure you can.

1181
01:24:14,576 --> 01:24:16,643
But I take a few noses, ears,

1182
01:24:16,645 --> 01:24:18,578
and pricks with me,
for sure I do.

1183
01:24:24,852 --> 01:24:26,519
You all hate me
for what I've done

1184
01:24:26,521 --> 01:24:27,856
to your people.

1185
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:31,757
I absorb your hate.

1186
01:24:31,759 --> 01:24:33,730
I feed on it.

1187
01:24:36,397 --> 01:24:39,398
And you, Francois,
you <i>bliksem</i> cunt?

1188
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,734
You hate me for all those terrible
things we've done together.

1189
01:24:52,681 --> 01:24:53,813
Discipline.

1190
01:25:06,262 --> 01:25:07,794
No.
No one.

1191
01:25:09,932 --> 01:25:12,265
No one.
Yes, he does.

1192
01:25:14,402 --> 01:25:15,669
I stand for him.

1193
01:25:23,445 --> 01:25:24,581
Quiet.

1194
01:25:30,386 --> 01:25:31,588
Benjamin.

1195
01:25:40,529 --> 01:25:42,461
Salute!
Salute!

1196
01:26:11,659 --> 01:26:13,660
Blomfeld,

1197
01:26:13,662 --> 01:26:16,595
I'll offer you a drink.

1198
01:26:16,597 --> 01:26:18,465
In your fucking dreams, <i>kaffir.</i>

1199
01:26:24,506 --> 01:26:25,872
And don't come
back, you'll get a lick

1200
01:26:25,874 --> 01:26:27,977
of my fucking cigarette, dude!

1201
01:26:29,544 --> 01:26:30,876
Did Howard leave?

1202
01:26:30,878 --> 01:26:31,847
Yes.

1203
01:26:33,548 --> 01:26:35,415
You know I think
Mr. Pollsmoor is a lost cause.

1204
01:26:35,417 --> 01:26:36,550
I hope you haven't sent Howard

1205
01:26:36,552 --> 01:26:39,019
on a wild goose chase.

1206
01:26:39,021 --> 01:26:40,023
I haven't.

1207
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:43,825
I'm getting to know my enemy.

1208
01:26:44,892 --> 01:26:47,594
Leah has been teaching me.

1209
01:26:47,596 --> 01:26:49,095
Any news
about Mrs. Morobe?

1210
01:26:49,097 --> 01:26:50,363
Kefilwe called.

1211
01:26:50,365 --> 01:26:51,801
She's out of hospital.

1212
01:26:53,034 --> 01:26:54,533
Good.

1213
01:26:54,535 --> 01:26:55,538
Father,

1214
01:26:57,039 --> 01:26:58,839
you feeling better?

1215
01:26:58,841 --> 01:27:00,107
Yes.

1216
01:27:00,109 --> 01:27:01,375
The other night

1217
01:27:01,377 --> 01:27:02,908
I got really, really angry

1218
01:27:02,910 --> 01:27:03,977
with God.

1219
01:27:03,979 --> 01:27:06,011
So angry with God, I said,

1220
01:27:06,013 --> 01:27:08,447
"How can you allow
such and such and such

1221
01:27:08,449 --> 01:27:10,384
and such a thing to happen?"

1222
01:27:10,386 --> 01:27:12,919
So, I scolded God

1223
01:27:12,921 --> 01:27:14,955
for not showing the world

1224
01:27:14,957 --> 01:27:16,523
who was in charge.

1225
01:27:16,525 --> 01:27:18,328
I said, "Are you
in charge, God?"

1226
01:27:20,428 --> 01:27:22,429
But then,

1227
01:27:22,431 --> 01:27:23,863
I realized

1228
01:27:23,865 --> 01:27:26,065
that that was His way

1229
01:27:26,067 --> 01:27:27,934
of getting my backside

1230
01:27:27,936 --> 01:27:29,806
off of the pity potty.

1231
01:27:55,631 --> 01:27:57,563
Mrs. Van Den Bergh?

1232
01:27:57,565 --> 01:28:00,500
You're a very punctual man,
Mr. Varney.

1233
01:28:00,502 --> 01:28:02,969
They told me at the shop
you'd be arriving at 11:00.

1234
01:28:02,971 --> 01:28:04,470
11:00 it is.

1235
01:28:04,472 --> 01:28:07,776
Do you remember someone
called Piet Blomfeld?

1236
01:28:10,212 --> 01:28:13,078
You look like
you need a cup of tea.

1237
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,383
Come inside.

1238
01:28:18,587 --> 01:28:20,821
Oh, go then!

1239
01:28:20,823 --> 01:28:22,188
They think they're Alsatians.

1240
01:28:34,770 --> 01:28:35,836
That's blood.

1241
01:28:35,838 --> 01:28:38,508
You need vinegar to clean blood.

1242
01:28:46,781 --> 01:28:48,450
I said you need vinegar.

1243
01:29:06,601 --> 01:29:08,969
The acid cuts the blood.

1244
01:29:08,971 --> 01:29:09,972
Scrub.

1245
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:16,609
You're very lucky
to be here, Benjamin.

1246
01:29:16,611 --> 01:29:18,980
This place
is better than any school.

1247
01:29:20,749 --> 01:29:21,818
Hey!

1248
01:29:24,119 --> 01:29:26,952
First, it'll teach you
who you are.

1249
01:29:26,954 --> 01:29:28,188
Then, if you have the balls,

1250
01:29:28,190 --> 01:29:29,723
it'll teach you
that the only person

1251
01:29:29,725 --> 01:29:31,494
you can change is yourself.

1252
01:29:33,061 --> 01:29:34,063
Understand?

1253
01:29:38,699 --> 01:29:40,699
I know I gave my word
that I would stand for you,

1254
01:29:40,701 --> 01:29:42,472
but other than that,

1255
01:29:43,571 --> 01:29:45,106
I don't give a <i>poes.</i>

1256
01:30:40,061 --> 01:30:43,930
I told you not to come here.

1257
01:30:43,932 --> 01:30:45,898
Please...

1258
01:31:15,664 --> 01:31:17,333
fuck.

1259
01:31:34,348 --> 01:31:36,217
Kruger?

1260
01:31:40,422 --> 01:31:41,757
Pollsmoor.

1261
01:31:47,396 --> 01:31:48,598
Yes?

1262
01:31:49,865 --> 01:31:51,067
Archbishop,

1263
01:31:55,037 --> 01:31:57,703
they are going
to piss themselves in hell

1264
01:31:57,705 --> 01:31:59,307
they are, at what
I'm going to do.

1265
01:32:00,842 --> 01:32:02,442
Come see me.

1266
01:32:02,444 --> 01:32:04,376
Yes,

1267
01:32:04,378 --> 01:32:07,247
I'm going to tell you
about a certain <i>braai</i>

1268
01:32:07,249 --> 01:32:09,815
and what we done when we were
knocking back a few drinks.

1269
01:32:09,817 --> 01:32:12,318
<i>You will wish to God</i>

1270
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:13,756
<i>you never listened.</i>

1271
01:32:15,323 --> 01:32:17,122
After that,
you can forget about me.

1272
01:32:17,124 --> 01:32:19,861
You'll have what you came for
and you and I will be done.

1273
01:32:21,997 --> 01:32:24,033
I will come tomorrow.

1274
01:32:27,369 --> 01:32:29,772
It's a fucking mess of shit.

1275
01:32:33,842 --> 01:32:36,208
Let Mrs. Morobe know

1276
01:32:36,210 --> 01:32:39,748
that Blomfeld is going to talk.

1277
01:32:51,025 --> 01:32:52,193
Thank you.

1278
01:32:58,499 --> 01:33:01,434
This one's got my will in it.

1279
01:33:01,436 --> 01:33:03,502
This one's a just-in-case,

1280
01:33:03,504 --> 01:33:04,973
if you know what I mean.

1281
01:33:06,341 --> 01:33:08,808
Will you post
that one personally,

1282
01:33:08,810 --> 01:33:10,245
outside the prison?

1283
01:33:12,379 --> 01:33:14,747
Yes,

1284
01:33:14,749 --> 01:33:17,282
we will move you
to the high security corridor.

1285
01:33:17,284 --> 01:33:19,919
You will be safe there.

1286
01:33:19,921 --> 01:33:22,455
Safe? Yes.

1287
01:33:22,457 --> 01:33:23,959
Safe it is.

1288
01:33:26,794 --> 01:33:28,928
<i>Mr. Varney.</i>

1289
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:30,162
Mr. Varney.

1290
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,400
You forgot the press clippings.

1291
01:33:35,402 --> 01:33:36,870
Thank you.
There is something

1292
01:33:36,872 --> 01:33:38,339
that I haven't told you.

1293
01:33:39,874 --> 01:33:41,541
After it was over,

1294
01:33:41,543 --> 01:33:42,809
the shooting,

1295
01:33:42,811 --> 01:33:44,410
you have
to understand one thing,

1296
01:33:44,412 --> 01:33:47,880
Rian Blomfeld, Piet's father,
was a bigoted monster.

1297
01:33:47,882 --> 01:33:49,415
After it was over,

1298
01:33:49,417 --> 01:33:52,117
he beat Piet up so badly,

1299
01:33:52,119 --> 01:33:54,854
he broke his arm.

1300
01:33:54,856 --> 01:33:56,790
And then the family
moved to Zimbabwe

1301
01:33:56,792 --> 01:33:59,893
and they sent Piet
to a white boarding school.

1302
01:33:59,895 --> 01:34:01,894
He was just ten years old.

1303
01:34:01,896 --> 01:34:03,328
He was away

1304
01:34:03,330 --> 01:34:06,064
when the family was wiped out.

1305
01:34:06,066 --> 01:34:07,966
Revenge, people thought.

1306
01:34:07,968 --> 01:34:10,271
And he blames himself
for all of it.

1307
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:15,875
I hope you can help Piet,

1308
01:34:15,877 --> 01:34:16,943
can you?

1309
01:34:16,945 --> 01:34:18,881
I hope so.

1310
01:34:20,147 --> 01:34:21,814
Goodbye Mrs. Van den Bergh

1311
01:34:21,816 --> 01:34:23,185
and good luck.

1312
01:34:47,942 --> 01:34:49,943
So he's coming to see him then,

1313
01:34:49,945 --> 01:34:51,147
tomorrow.

1314
01:34:52,881 --> 01:34:54,180
Who?

1315
01:34:54,182 --> 01:34:55,614
Who's coming to see who?

1316
01:34:55,616 --> 01:34:58,117
That fucking <i>kaffir</i> Archbishop.

1317
01:34:58,119 --> 01:35:00,586
He's coming to see Blomfeld.

1318
01:35:00,588 --> 01:35:03,958
He got the department
to overrule the governor.

1319
01:35:05,259 --> 01:35:07,163
Blomfeld is fucking with me.

1320
01:35:12,933 --> 01:35:14,869
What is it
with you and Blomfeld?

1321
01:35:18,173 --> 01:35:20,810
We were in the same
hit squad together.

1322
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:24,143
He got arrested,

1323
01:35:24,145 --> 01:35:26,880
I went undercover.

1324
01:35:26,882 --> 01:35:29,983
Me and him, we go back,

1325
01:35:29,985 --> 01:35:31,050
way back,

1326
01:35:31,052 --> 01:35:33,452
even before Vlakplas.

1327
01:35:33,454 --> 01:35:35,390
Boss himself gave us orders.

1328
01:35:37,292 --> 01:35:38,360
Fucker!

1329
01:35:46,534 --> 01:35:49,068
Too fucking right, brother.

1330
01:35:49,070 --> 01:35:51,938
He crosses, he sinks me.

1331
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:53,305
Fuck.

1332
01:35:53,307 --> 01:35:55,908
I never took him for a canary.

1333
01:35:55,910 --> 01:35:58,310
You know, the governor's
got him on J-Wing.

1334
01:35:58,312 --> 01:35:59,912
Yeah?

1335
01:35:59,914 --> 01:36:03,218
Well, that won't
fucking save him.

1336
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:07,053
What are you gonna do, Sergeant?

1337
01:36:07,055 --> 01:36:09,956
I'm gonna put the shit
heap on lockdown.

1338
01:36:09,958 --> 01:36:11,456
I still got friends.

1339
01:37:07,716 --> 01:37:09,482
Fucking quick off the mark.

1340
01:37:09,484 --> 01:37:11,020
I give them that.

1341
01:37:26,301 --> 01:37:28,266
Time to pay,

1342
01:37:28,268 --> 01:37:30,536
but you burn in hell with me.

1343
01:37:30,538 --> 01:37:32,508
Oh, yeah, for sure you burn.

1344
01:37:37,579 --> 01:37:40,613
No lusting to hang on,

1345
01:37:40,615 --> 01:37:42,648
no prayers, no begging,

1346
01:37:42,650 --> 01:37:45,251
never submit, never yield.

1347
01:37:45,253 --> 01:37:47,153
Let them come.

1348
01:37:47,155 --> 01:37:50,059
Let them fucking come!

1349
01:38:55,789 --> 01:38:57,456
Well then,

1350
01:38:57,458 --> 01:38:59,458
how are you feeling now,

1351
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:00,561
a bit fucked?

1352
01:39:02,196 --> 01:39:05,266
So you thought
you could fucking snitch.

1353
01:39:06,534 --> 01:39:09,102
I am what I am.

1354
01:39:09,104 --> 01:39:10,435
See you in hell,

1355
01:39:10,437 --> 01:39:14,208
you knuckle-dragging maggot.

1356
01:40:22,877 --> 01:40:23,879
Hansi!

1357
01:40:25,213 --> 01:40:26,778
Hansi!

1358
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:27,815
Hansi!

1359
01:40:49,470 --> 01:40:53,206
<i>It was
the girl's time of the month.</i>

1360
01:40:53,208 --> 01:40:54,643
<i>So we stripped her naked.</i>

1361
01:40:56,543 --> 01:40:57,777
<i>We made her stand there</i>

1362
01:40:57,779 --> 01:41:00,313
<i>with her hands above her head</i>

1363
01:41:00,315 --> 01:41:03,482
<i>while the blood
ran down her legs,</i>

1364
01:41:03,484 --> 01:41:04,785
<i>to break her spirit.</i>

1365
01:41:07,855 --> 01:41:09,555
<i>Her boyfriend,</i>

1366
01:41:09,557 --> 01:41:11,590
<i>Siswe Nxumalo was still drugged</i>

1367
01:41:11,592 --> 01:41:13,960
<i>in the back of the bakkie.</i>

1368
01:41:13,962 --> 01:41:15,861
<i>Some of the boys,</i>

1369
01:41:15,863 --> 01:41:17,529
<i>Hansi Coetzee,</i>

1370
01:41:17,531 --> 01:41:18,663
<i>Francois Schmidt,</i>

1371
01:41:18,665 --> 01:41:20,366
<i>some of the others,</i>

1372
01:41:20,368 --> 01:41:21,666
<i>they went and got the tires</i>

1373
01:41:21,668 --> 01:41:23,704
<i>and the wood for the burning.</i>

1374
01:41:26,807 --> 01:41:28,674
<i>Oh, and Rensberger,</i>

1375
01:41:28,676 --> 01:41:30,275
<i>he went back to the farm</i>

1376
01:41:30,277 --> 01:41:32,748
<i>to collect the beers
and some steaks.</i>

1377
01:41:36,851 --> 01:41:39,318
<i>I went into the hut.</i>

1378
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:41,019
<i>The girl had tied
a bit of old plastic</i>

1379
01:41:41,021 --> 01:41:42,955
<i>around her middle</i>

1380
01:41:42,957 --> 01:41:44,991
<i>for decency.</i>

1381
01:41:44,993 --> 01:41:46,460
<i>It didn't cover much.</i>

1382
01:41:48,029 --> 01:41:49,364
<i>I made her kneel.</i>

1383
01:41:51,531 --> 01:41:52,598
<i>I had the Makarov</i>

1384
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:55,333
<i>with the silencer on.</i>

1385
01:41:55,335 --> 01:41:58,207
<i>I put it
to the back of her skull</i>

1386
01:41:59,507 --> 01:42:00,805
<i>and then I blew</i>

1387
01:42:00,807 --> 01:42:01,873
<i>the top of her head off.</i>

1388
01:42:08,615 --> 01:42:10,715
Switch it off!
Switch it off!

1389
01:42:17,324 --> 01:42:20,358
We will resume in ten minutes.

1390
01:42:32,373 --> 01:42:35,340
<i>While we waited
for the bodies to burn,</i>

1391
01:42:35,342 --> 01:42:37,410
<i>we opened...</i>

1392
01:42:37,412 --> 01:42:38,844
<i>we opened some beers</i>

1393
01:42:38,846 --> 01:42:41,316
<i>and we had...</i>

1394
01:42:42,816 --> 01:42:44,652
<i>someone said, let's...</i>

1395
01:42:46,654 --> 01:42:47,955
<i>we had a braai...</i>

1396
01:42:55,997 --> 01:42:59,334
Those two young people,

1397
01:43:00,868 --> 01:43:03,669
those children

1398
01:43:03,671 --> 01:43:06,040
had just been murdered

1399
01:43:09,343 --> 01:43:11,810
and you people,

1400
01:43:11,812 --> 01:43:14,482
as their bodies burned

1401
01:43:15,583 --> 01:43:17,451
had a <i>braai,</i>

1402
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:21,290
a barbecue?

1403
01:43:25,525 --> 01:43:26,662
Yes.

1404
01:43:30,565 --> 01:43:32,534
So help me God, I...

1405
01:43:35,002 --> 01:43:37,906
Was my baby an enemy
to the state?

1406
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:40,909
In what way?

1407
01:43:48,149 --> 01:43:49,715
I know nothing can bring

1408
01:43:49,717 --> 01:43:51,185
your daughter back.

1409
01:43:55,056 --> 01:43:56,558
I want to.

1410
01:44:00,595 --> 01:44:01,926
God above as my witness,

1411
01:44:01,928 --> 01:44:04,596
Mrs. Morobe.

1412
01:44:04,598 --> 01:44:07,369
I want nothing more than that.

1413
01:44:15,810 --> 01:44:18,113
I deserve to be punished.

1414
01:44:21,015 --> 01:44:23,118
I've lost my right to live

1415
01:44:28,122 --> 01:44:30,523
but I can't unmake
what's happened

1416
01:44:30,525 --> 01:44:32,361
even if I wish it so.

1417
01:44:35,128 --> 01:44:37,062
And...

1418
01:44:37,064 --> 01:44:40,435
I can't ask you to forget

1419
01:44:42,503 --> 01:44:43,538
and I...

1420
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:47,773
I can't ask you to forgive me.

1421
01:44:47,775 --> 01:44:49,875
I just can't...

1422
01:44:49,877 --> 01:44:51,079
I can't...

1423
01:44:56,883 --> 01:44:58,886
I can't forgive myself.

1424
01:45:02,222 --> 01:45:04,024
All I can say is, um...

1425
01:45:08,529 --> 01:45:10,031
I'm so...

1426
01:45:12,833 --> 01:45:14,769
I'm so...

1427
01:45:16,671 --> 01:45:18,103
very, very sorry

1428
01:45:18,105 --> 01:45:19,641
for what I've done.

1429
01:45:43,698 --> 01:45:46,133
Stand up, Mr. Coetzee.

1430
01:45:56,776 --> 01:46:00,712
You robbed me of the most

1431
01:46:00,714 --> 01:46:03,948
beautiful thing in my life

1432
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:08,053
and you left me as dead

1433
01:46:08,055 --> 01:46:11,125
as the two children.

1434
01:46:14,861 --> 01:46:18,899
You personally
did not kill my child

1435
01:46:20,133 --> 01:46:22,166
but you never

1436
01:46:22,168 --> 01:46:24,769
found it in your heart

1437
01:46:24,771 --> 01:46:26,707
to protect her.

1438
01:46:30,845 --> 01:46:35,813
A teenage girl at your mercy

1439
01:46:35,815 --> 01:46:39,086
but you never even tried.

1440
01:46:40,754 --> 01:46:43,658
What a small man you are.

1441
01:46:45,825 --> 01:46:48,096
Look at me, Mr. Coetzee.

1442
01:46:52,732 --> 01:46:54,599
When I hear you speak

1443
01:46:54,601 --> 01:46:56,835
of my child's death,

1444
01:46:56,837 --> 01:47:00,706
my heart cries out to kill you.

1445
01:47:00,708 --> 01:47:04,045
A mother's heart
cries out for that!

1446
01:47:05,812 --> 01:47:06,847
Yes...

1447
01:47:08,348 --> 01:47:10,748
I want to kill you

1448
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:12,787
like she was killed.

1449
01:47:15,222 --> 01:47:17,192
See what you have done!

1450
01:47:20,093 --> 01:47:23,929
But I do not want
my daughter's death

1451
01:47:23,931 --> 01:47:27,032
to be made dirty with revenge

1452
01:47:27,034 --> 01:47:29,134
and death

1453
01:47:29,136 --> 01:47:32,037
because she was beautiful,

1454
01:47:32,039 --> 01:47:34,238
too beautiful for ugliness

1455
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:36,310
to be her memory.

1456
01:47:42,216 --> 01:47:44,750
Mr. Coetzee,

1457
01:47:44,752 --> 01:47:47,219
my child...

1458
01:47:47,221 --> 01:47:50,723
looks down on us now.

1459
01:47:50,725 --> 01:47:53,328
I can feel it.

1460
01:47:56,062 --> 01:47:59,697
And she offers us a chance

1461
01:47:59,699 --> 01:48:02,604
to start again.

1462
01:48:03,803 --> 01:48:05,172
For you...

1463
01:48:06,406 --> 01:48:09,174
to make amends,

1464
01:48:09,176 --> 01:48:12,047
to be a big man,

1465
01:48:15,016 --> 01:48:18,282
and for me... and for me

1466
01:48:18,284 --> 01:48:22,189
to live again,

1467
01:48:23,324 --> 01:48:25,791
and for her sake,

1468
01:48:25,793 --> 01:48:28,129
I will do this.

1469
01:48:30,798 --> 01:48:33,831
Hansi Coetzee,

1470
01:48:33,833 --> 01:48:36,068
let her see us

1471
01:48:36,070 --> 01:48:39,874
make a clean slate for her sake.

1472
01:49:56,083 --> 01:49:58,216
Benjamin.

1473
01:49:58,218 --> 01:50:00,285
Good to meet you.

1474
01:50:00,287 --> 01:50:01,754
Do you know why you're here?

1475
01:50:01,756 --> 01:50:04,355
Something about the Blomfeld?

1476
01:50:04,357 --> 01:50:07,227
Yes, something about
the Blomfeld.

1477
01:50:09,129 --> 01:50:10,461
Governor?

1478
01:50:10,463 --> 01:50:11,764
Hello, Benjamin.

1479
01:50:11,766 --> 01:50:12,831
Yes, sir.

1480
01:50:12,833 --> 01:50:13,898
How are you?

1481
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:15,035
I'm good, sir.

1482
01:50:16,203 --> 01:50:17,970
Don't worry.

1483
01:50:17,972 --> 01:50:19,270
The department will transfer you

1484
01:50:19,272 --> 01:50:20,839
out of this prison

1485
01:50:20,841 --> 01:50:22,407
but before that,

1486
01:50:22,409 --> 01:50:23,474
I'm going to read you

1487
01:50:23,476 --> 01:50:25,109
the last will and testament

1488
01:50:25,111 --> 01:50:26,314
of Piet Blomfeld.

1489
01:50:30,985 --> 01:50:33,919
"All I have
are a few bits of junk,

1490
01:50:33,921 --> 01:50:35,487
except for my copy of the poem

1491
01:50:35,489 --> 01:50:37,790
<i>'Paradise Lost...'"</i>

1492
01:50:37,792 --> 01:50:38,857
<i>Which is to be given</i>

1493
01:50:38,859 --> 01:50:41,160
<i>to Benjamin Mboweni.</i>

1494
01:50:41,162 --> 01:50:42,426
<i>There is a little money of mine</i>

1495
01:50:42,428 --> 01:50:44,796
<i>in the Witwatersrand Bank.</i>

1496
01:50:44,798 --> 01:50:47,265
<i>That money
I leave to you, Benjamin,</i>

1497
01:50:47,267 --> 01:50:49,400
<i>for your use.</i>

1498
01:50:49,402 --> 01:50:50,469
<i>Understand, Benjamin,</i>

1499
01:50:50,471 --> 01:50:53,238
<i>it is not an apology</i>

1500
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:55,974
<i>but it is a reparation</i>

1501
01:50:55,976 --> 01:50:57,576
<i>to free you from the results</i>

1502
01:50:57,578 --> 01:50:58,844
<i>of what has been done</i>

1503
01:50:58,846 --> 01:51:00,248
<i>to your people.</i>

1504
01:51:12,525 --> 01:51:15,763
Oh, I wanted to talk to you.

1505
01:51:17,198 --> 01:51:18,529
Sit down.

1506
01:51:18,531 --> 01:51:19,767
Okay.

1507
01:51:25,338 --> 01:51:28,607
I've come to thank you.

1508
01:51:28,609 --> 01:51:31,977
You know, for what
you've been doing,

1509
01:51:31,979 --> 01:51:33,845
shining a light

1510
01:51:33,847 --> 01:51:35,449
into a dark place.

1511
01:51:37,284 --> 01:51:41,286
You are a brave woman,

1512
01:51:41,288 --> 01:51:44,055
Mrs. Coetzee.

1513
01:51:44,057 --> 01:51:47,925
I hated you at first.

1514
01:51:49,997 --> 01:51:51,296
Of course.

1515
01:51:51,298 --> 01:51:53,064
I'm just as easy to hate

1516
01:51:53,066 --> 01:51:54,569
as I am to love.

1517
01:51:56,136 --> 01:51:59,136
Well, I just...
I guess I just...

1518
01:51:59,138 --> 01:52:00,507
I lived in a bubble.

1519
01:52:02,243 --> 01:52:04,343
But now I ask myself,

1520
01:52:04,345 --> 01:52:06,478
"How could I not see?"

1521
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:08,647
I'm not talking
just about Hansi.

1522
01:52:08,649 --> 01:52:10,581
I guess I'm really talking about

1523
01:52:10,583 --> 01:52:13,385
everything that's been going on.

1524
01:52:13,387 --> 01:52:17,154
I pretended that
it wasn't happening, but...

1525
01:52:17,156 --> 01:52:21,126
I knew.

1526
01:52:21,128 --> 01:52:22,661
And at this point,

1527
01:52:22,663 --> 01:52:24,966
probably doesn't
mean much, but...

1528
01:52:27,133 --> 01:52:30,270
I want to say I'm sorry.

1529
01:52:32,272 --> 01:52:34,605
Why doesn't it mean much

1530
01:52:34,607 --> 01:52:37,378
to say you're sorry?

1531
01:52:39,113 --> 01:52:41,246
I guess because I think that

1532
01:52:41,248 --> 01:52:43,581
I'm a bad person

1533
01:52:43,583 --> 01:52:46,220
and that you'll think
these are just white tears.

1534
01:52:48,989 --> 01:52:52,690
Happily, tears,

1535
01:52:52,692 --> 01:52:54,494
they don't have any color

1536
01:52:56,163 --> 01:52:59,531
and I think you're a person

1537
01:52:59,533 --> 01:53:01,966
in need of a hug

1538
01:53:01,968 --> 01:53:04,538
just like the rest of us.

1539
01:54:05,598 --> 01:54:07,264
What was that for?

1540
01:54:07,266 --> 01:54:09,266
I'm sorry.

1541
01:54:09,268 --> 01:54:10,702
These last two years have been

1542
01:54:10,704 --> 01:54:12,336
hard for you, Leah.

1543
01:54:12,338 --> 01:54:13,471
But I just want you to know

1544
01:54:13,473 --> 01:54:15,172
I never took you for granted.

1545
01:54:15,174 --> 01:54:16,440
Never.

1546
01:54:16,442 --> 01:54:19,044
Why, you old goat,

1547
01:54:19,046 --> 01:54:21,513
are you asking me
for forgiveness?

1548
01:54:21,515 --> 01:54:22,613
I suppose I am.

1549
01:54:23,784 --> 01:54:25,349
Look at it.

1550
01:54:25,351 --> 01:54:27,251
What a beautiful sight.

1551
01:54:27,253 --> 01:54:30,255
Yes, the sea and all its colors.

1552
01:54:30,257 --> 01:54:31,489
I've always loved them.

1553
01:54:31,491 --> 01:54:32,690
No, no, no, I mean,

1554
01:54:32,692 --> 01:54:36,361
here on the beach.

1555
01:54:36,363 --> 01:54:38,330
Our beach.

1556
