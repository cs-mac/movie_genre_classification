1
00:02:15,726 --> 00:02:18,719
Mom, do you remember that one time
when we were little

2
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,639
and Gail made that huge dinner
out of nowhere?

3
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,599
Oh, my God, yeah!

4
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,199
That was amazing.

5
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,999
Mom, he made this soup, by the way.

6
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,239
Really?

7
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,679
Did you know he did his
internship in Chicago?

8
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,159
You did an internship?

9
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,839
I did an internship
at this kitchen.

10
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,799
I saw him chopping the carrots,

11
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,359
and he was like a professional
carrot-chopper, with a knife.

12
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,039
How long did you intern?

13
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,666
Two months, erm, like,
20 hours a week.

14
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,750
I could have kept going,
but I kind of quit,

15
00:02:45,973 --> 00:02:49,439
because I didn't get paid
and I started getting bored.

16
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,559
Yeah.

17
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,239
How do you go from
forensic science

18
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,639
to cutting up vegetables
in a restaurant?

19
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,967
I don't know. I mean, it was like
a fleeting interest.

20
00:02:59,988 --> 00:03:01,084
I don't know.

21
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,595
Would you consider going
back to school?

22
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,556
Erm, I mean, not immediately.

23
00:03:08,997 --> 00:03:12,959
I just want to get a job and get some
money, and then, I don't know.

24
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,239
It's not...

25
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:16,247
It's still a possibility.

26
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,117
I'm glad you came home.

27
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:25,279
I bought us a coffee table.

28
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,533
- Did you?
- He did.

29
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,583
- Oh, really?
- I'm assembling it.

30
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:30,538
It's coming right along.

31
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:33,238
And by coming right along,
I mean not at all.

32
00:03:33,664 --> 00:03:34,959
Still in the box.

33
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,279
So, how's it going?

34
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,479
I know you guys have
only been here a week, but...

35
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,439
It's really good, actually.

36
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,479
Yeah?

37
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,639
Yeah. I really like it.

38
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,359
I really like the place, and we're
not screaming at each other yet.

39
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,119
Yeah.

40
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,479
Well, that's good.
It's nice to see you guys together.

41
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,420
We did...
Never mind.

42
00:03:50,654 --> 00:03:52,160
- What?
- Nothing, nothing.

43
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,833
- Oh, come on.
- No, I forgot.

44
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:56,439
How about you?
How's work going?

45
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,650
It's good, it's good. Everybody's
really nice, and I'm lucky.

46
00:04:00,012 --> 00:04:01,166
Yeah?

47
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
Yeah, it's really good.

48
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,520
All right,
I'm going to go to bed now.

49
00:04:15,778 --> 00:04:16,679
OK.

50
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,381
- Good night.
- Good night.

51
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,467
You going to go to bed soon?

52
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,233
Erm, I don't know.
Not really tired.

53
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:25,563
It's weird you're never tired.

54
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,172
Tired in the morning.

55
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,367
Yeah.

56
00:04:32,812 --> 00:04:33,902
Me too.

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,041
All right.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,721
- Going to bed.
- OK.

59
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,784
- Good night.
- Good night.

60
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,553
Gail.

61
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,159
What up?

62
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,799
How's it going?

63
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,439
What are you doing here?

64
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,001
What do you mean?

65
00:05:44,532 --> 00:05:46,563
You're, erm, you're at my office.

66
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:47,504
Yeah.

67
00:05:47,624 --> 00:05:48,639
All right.

68
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,988
Hey, you want to go to the coast?

69
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,317
What?

70
00:05:55,437 --> 00:05:57,592
I have, like...
No.

71
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,129
It's whale watching week.

72
00:06:02,913 --> 00:06:04,519
Doug, I've got, like...

73
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,759
I have a job.

74
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,442
I can't just leave
and go whale watching with you.

75
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:10,531
Yeah, but it's a special occasion.

76
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,133
Can't you just do this
stuff tomorrow?

77
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:17,599
Not... I mean, no, I can't.

78
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,790
People just can't,
like, just leave work.

79
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,846
- Just once?
- They have things to do.

80
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:23,039
You can do it one time.

81
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,759
What if everybody here just went
whale watching today?

82
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,261
I made sandwiches.

83
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:18,017
Look at this sea life.

84
00:07:21,463 --> 00:07:23,830
Going to take this home
and put it in your bed.

85
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,329
That's what you get for bringing
me out here!

86
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,919
Thanks for coming in.

87
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,320
I appreciate it.

88
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,919
What I'm looking for is somebody
that can work, you know,

89
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,199
start now, here in the spring,
and through the summer, fall.

90
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,839
Winter's kind of slow,
but there'd be work year-round.

91
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,359
Got a couple of other guys
that work the night shift for us,

92
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,168
and we're looking for another man
to help out with that.

93
00:09:57,491 --> 00:09:59,858
Got insulated coveralls
and everything for you.

94
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:01,826
- Yeah, that's fine.
- All right.

95
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,182
Forensic science, criminal justice.

96
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,799
That's a pretty interesting field.

97
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,319
What, are you just taking a break?

98
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,839
Planning on going back to it?

99
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,599
Er, yeah.
Maybe eventually.

100
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,119
Eventually.

101
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,119
That's pretty neat stuff.

102
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,399
If it's anything like on the movies,
it's pretty darn neat.

103
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,417
Yeah.

104
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,817
OK.

105
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:24,070
Let's see.

106
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,036
Ice factory.

107
00:10:43,031 --> 00:10:45,140
I thought you might
get a job, like...

108
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,920
..in something crime-related,
like in a lab, or something.

109
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:54,878
No. I don't think you can get those
jobs if you don't finish school.

110
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,378
Are you sure you're going
to be OK in an ice factory?

111
00:10:59,498 --> 00:11:00,635
Yeah.

112
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:03,054
Why wouldn't I be?

113
00:11:06,895 --> 00:11:08,325
I don't know...

114
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:11,638
I didn't even know
they had ice factories.

115
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,239
Yeah. Where do you think they get
those bags of ice you buy?

116
00:11:14,493 --> 00:11:16,360
I don't know,
I never thought about it.

117
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:49,791
Hey, man.

118
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:52,422
What's going on?

119
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:54,486
Not much.

120
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,588
Do you usually take the bus?

121
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:01,427
Yeah.

122
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:06,603
I thought you had a car?

123
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:08,872
Yeah, I do.

124
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:12,225
Some asshole broke my window.

125
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,213
Now it's in the shop.

126
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:21,204
But it'll be ready tomorrow. I won't
have to put up with this bullshit.

127
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,494
Dude, think of me.
I've got to do this every day.

128
00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:29,889
I'm only kidding.

129
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:33,985
I'm only half kidding.

130
00:13:48,763 --> 00:13:49,959
Where you heading?

131
00:13:50,637 --> 00:13:52,946
I've got to go meet my ex-girlfriend.

132
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:54,400
Oh, yeah?

133
00:13:54,637 --> 00:13:56,231
Like a date or something?

134
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:58,879
No, like, just checking in, kind of.

135
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:00,696
She's here from out of town.

136
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:04,718
That's cool.

137
00:14:36,557 --> 00:14:37,623
Hi.

138
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,100
Hi.

139
00:14:44,107 --> 00:14:45,502
It's raining.

140
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:05,146
I'll be right back.

141
00:15:30,582 --> 00:15:32,837
That's a lot of stuff.
What is it, tea?

142
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,102
Yeah.

143
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,575
How are you?

144
00:15:39,926 --> 00:15:41,086
Pretty good.

145
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,399
How are you?

146
00:15:43,595 --> 00:15:44,743
Good.

147
00:15:45,724 --> 00:15:47,552
How's living with your sister?

148
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:49,966
It's good.

149
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:51,899
It's nice.

150
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:56,261
You like it more than
living with me?

151
00:15:58,505 --> 00:15:59,735
I don't know.

152
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,401
Maybe not.

153
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:08,106
So, what are you in town for?

154
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:10,438
For work.

155
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,919
I got a job in a law
office in Chicago

156
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,235
and their main office is here, so
they sent me up for some training.

157
00:16:20,075 --> 00:16:24,306
Yeah, I got a hotel room
and they paid for my ticket.

158
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,550
You work in a law office?

159
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,859
I do.

160
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,559
That's strange.

161
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,114
It is. I've worked in an office
before, though, so...

162
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:38,600
How about you?
What are you doing?

163
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,823
Oh, God.

164
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,842
I got a job working overnight
in an ice factory.

165
00:16:48,764 --> 00:16:53,545
I, like, load bags of ice into
crates, put them onto a truck.

166
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:58,190
I don't know.
This is the only thing I could get.

167
00:17:03,846 --> 00:17:05,803
Can I come and see
your place sometime?

168
00:17:06,216 --> 00:17:07,998
Erm, yeah, I guess so.

169
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,470
Guess so?

170
00:17:11,808 --> 00:17:13,484
I mean, there's nothing there.

171
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:16,798
But yeah, of course.

172
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,839
Actually, I invited all the people
that I work with

173
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,959
on the nightshift to come over
and play poker.

174
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,159
Oh, yeah?

175
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,355
Just, like, drink beer, play cards.

176
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,230
You want to come to that?

177
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:29,707
Sure.

178
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:50,434
Don't just take a tiny...
Just knock the rest back.

179
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,051
- The whole thing?
- Yeah.

180
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,598
There's, like, tons in there.

181
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:55,214
Well, it's like a shot.

182
00:17:57,441 --> 00:17:58,472
No.

183
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,417
You're supposed to sip it.

184
00:18:15,184 --> 00:18:16,159
Spade?

185
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,261
No?

186
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,245
Left of the dealer.

187
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:30,084
Did he just go?
No, he didn't go.

188
00:18:30,316 --> 00:18:31,216
Hello?

189
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:32,707
'Hey, it's Carlos.'

190
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,218
Hey, one second.

191
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,652
What's happening?

192
00:18:44,772 --> 00:18:46,224
It's your turn.

193
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,238
Why do I have eight cards?

194
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,936
Because you need to discard.

195
00:18:50,182 --> 00:18:51,781
You never discarded.

196
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:02,234
Come in.

197
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,399
How's it going?

198
00:19:05,681 --> 00:19:07,599
- How are you doing?
- Good, thanks for coming.

199
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:09,543
Thanks, thanks for having me.

200
00:19:10,158 --> 00:19:11,037
Hi.

201
00:19:11,298 --> 00:19:13,198
Hi, I'm Gail. Nice to meet you.

202
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,459
Yeah, that's my sister.
This is Rachel.

203
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:17,923
This is my friend Carlos, from work.

204
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:19,968
It's a nice place, man.

205
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:21,038
Thanks.

206
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:22,176
Thanks.

207
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:24,086
It's not fully done yet.

208
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:26,750
It's kind of nice, though.

209
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:29,253
Sorry.

210
00:19:29,373 --> 00:19:30,308
It's OK.

211
00:19:30,806 --> 00:19:32,525
Do you want some potato chips?

212
00:19:32,865 --> 00:19:34,836
Sure. Thank you.

213
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:36,777
We're playing rummy.

214
00:19:36,897 --> 00:19:37,902
It's your turn.

215
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:39,821
- It's my turn?
- No, Doug.

216
00:19:40,398 --> 00:19:42,040
I don't think I know
how to play rummy.

217
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,524
I've got a question for you.

218
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:21,356
Oh, yeah?

219
00:22:21,684 --> 00:22:26,885
Listen, I don't want
you to get offended.

220
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,542
Why am I going to be offended?

221
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:36,692
I don't know. I feel like some people
don't like being asked this question.

222
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:38,519
Erm...

223
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:44,639
Will you tell me how much
you get paid?

224
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,705
1,240. Why? How much you make?

225
00:22:49,045 --> 00:22:50,065
Eight.

226
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:52,593
Oh, don't worry.
They raise pay pretty good here.

227
00:22:52,713 --> 00:22:53,478
Yeah?

228
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,059
Yeah.
You'll get a raise soon.

229
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,398
If you don't quit first.

230
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:00,027
Why would I quit?

231
00:23:00,772 --> 00:23:02,389
I don't know, man.

232
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:05,002
You seem like the kind
that ends up quitting.

233
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:08,300
I mean, no offence,
it's just that, well,

234
00:23:08,696 --> 00:23:11,549
people only work here for
like a month or something.

235
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:13,236
- Really?
- Yeah.

236
00:23:13,787 --> 00:23:15,981
A lot of people want bigger things.

237
00:23:16,986 --> 00:23:18,767
I don't mind it, though.

238
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,056
I mean, I can think and move
ice at the same time, you know.

239
00:23:23,631 --> 00:23:26,537
Yeah, that's how my sister is.
She can multitask.

240
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,664
Hey, you know, that reminds me.

241
00:23:32,422 --> 00:23:34,130
You should come to
one of my DJ nights,

242
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,838
and bring your sister
and Rachel, too.

243
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,395
What DJ nights?

244
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,431
I DJ sometimes, man.

245
00:23:40,551 --> 00:23:41,672
You do?

246
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:45,894
Good shit. Latin shit from the '60s.

247
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:48,378
Shit you never heard before.

248
00:23:48,745 --> 00:23:50,339
This blows my mind!

249
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:51,948
Why?

250
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,600
I don't know.

251
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,850
You think, just because I move ice
I can't do something like that?

252
00:24:01,471 --> 00:24:03,078
No, I just, I don't know.

253
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:05,742
I never pictured you as a DJ.

254
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,942
So, what else do you do?

255
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,282
Nothing.

256
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:16,172
Well, I mean, I know you're not like
an ice professional, or anything.

257
00:24:17,452 --> 00:24:18,899
What did you do before?

258
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,775
I used to study forensic science.

259
00:24:20,895 --> 00:24:21,865
Really?

260
00:24:21,985 --> 00:24:23,079
Yeah.

261
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,077
That's much more surprising
than me being a DJ.

262
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,401
Is it?

263
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:31,118
Yeah. What, do you want to
be a detective or some shit?

264
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:32,573
Yeah, exactly.

265
00:24:33,728 --> 00:24:34,912
For real?

266
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:37,045
Don't mess with me, man!

267
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,918
I am going to be a detective one day.

268
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:41,884
What, like CSI and shit?

269
00:24:43,504 --> 00:24:46,499
I don't really want to be like
a CSI-type detective.

270
00:24:46,803 --> 00:24:48,638
I want to be more like
Sherlock Holmes.

271
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:49,978
Sherlock Holmes?

272
00:24:50,098 --> 00:24:51,094
Yeah.

273
00:24:52,232 --> 00:24:53,781
You've got to be kidding me, man.

274
00:24:54,003 --> 00:24:55,105
What?

275
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:56,758
Yo, Mike.

276
00:24:56,879 --> 00:24:57,879
Hey, Mike.

277
00:24:57,999 --> 00:24:59,918
Our friend Douglas wants
to be Sherlock Holmes!

278
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:00,919
No shit!

279
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,979
Sherlock fucking Holmes!

280
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:05,279
Why is that funny?

281
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:06,918
"Elementary, my dear Watson."

282
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,118
All that shit.

283
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:09,478
No, dude.

284
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:10,996
He doesn't say that.

285
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:12,238
He doesn't?

286
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,499
No, he doesn't say that, he
doesn't smoke a stupid pipe.

287
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:18,103
He doesn't wear that stupid hat.

288
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,443
Oh, shit, really?

289
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:24,086
Yeah. In the books, he's just,
like, the man.

290
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,129
Sherlock fucking Holmes.

291
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,682
You want to borrow one of the books?

292
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,398
What, a Sherlock Holmes book?

293
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:34,359
Yeah.

294
00:25:37,265 --> 00:25:38,678
I guess, man, sure.

295
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,088
I'll bring you one.

296
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:41,307
All right.

297
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:20,398
How's your milk shake?

298
00:27:20,763 --> 00:27:22,399
It's good. Do you want to try it?

299
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:23,518
I've got mine.

300
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:26,006
Yeah, but, like, mine
is really good.

301
00:27:26,338 --> 00:27:27,958
That may be true.

302
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,398
Mine is just as good.

303
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,838
That's why I ordered it.

304
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:32,478
Dude, just try the milk shake.

305
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,546
I don't want to try it.

306
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:35,002
I'll try your milk shake.

307
00:27:38,555 --> 00:27:39,820
See?

308
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:42,918
She ordered coffee! Of course she
wants to try the milk shake.

309
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,758
She wants to try everybody's,
I'm sure!

310
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:45,758
It's really good.

311
00:27:45,879 --> 00:27:47,071
I'll try your milk shake, Carlos.

312
00:27:47,191 --> 00:27:49,198
She's just trying to be irritating.

313
00:27:49,964 --> 00:27:51,534
I wanted to ask you something.

314
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:52,782
What?

315
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,694
What are you doing on Wednesday?

316
00:27:56,616 --> 00:27:58,174
I don't know. Why?

317
00:27:58,656 --> 00:28:00,639
Well, I've got an extra ticket
to this thing.

318
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:03,704
My cousin was supposed to go
with me, but he kind of bailed.

319
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,722
What is it?

320
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,958
Well, it's this really fun thing,

321
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:12,463
but you're not going to think
it's so fun at first.

322
00:28:12,722 --> 00:28:14,409
What? What is it?

323
00:28:15,563 --> 00:28:17,309
It's a Star Trek convention.

324
00:28:17,556 --> 00:28:19,479
Get out of here! Are you serious?

325
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,721
I don't want to do that!

326
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,841
Dude, it'll be fun, even if
you don't like Star Trek.

327
00:28:25,087 --> 00:28:26,411
I don't like Star Trek.

328
00:28:26,968 --> 00:28:29,038
Marina Sirtis is going to be there.

329
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:30,580
I don't know who that is.

330
00:28:30,968 --> 00:28:33,675
Dude, Marina Sirtis is famous,
even if you don't know Star Trek.

331
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,359
She's Counsellor Troi.

332
00:28:36,622 --> 00:28:38,109
I don't know what that means.

333
00:28:38,554 --> 00:28:39,523
Forget it.

334
00:28:39,643 --> 00:28:40,694
No, don't forget it.

335
00:28:40,814 --> 00:28:43,783
I know somebody who would love
to go to a Star Trek convention.

336
00:28:45,688 --> 00:28:47,443
I know someone at this very table

337
00:28:47,563 --> 00:28:50,139
who has been to several
Star Trek conventions.

338
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,624
Well, it's not me.

339
00:28:52,882 --> 00:28:54,337
What about you, Rachel?

340
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:58,074
You have any idea who
Counsellor Troi is?

341
00:29:05,652 --> 00:29:06,800
You finish it?

342
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,239
- Wow, that was fast.
- It's amazing.

343
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:10,358
Really?

344
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:12,638
It's brilliant shit, man.
Sherlock Holmes is the pimp.

345
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,158
Told you, man!

346
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,278
That's so cool.

347
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:16,729
Yeah, I had no idea.

348
00:29:16,849 --> 00:29:18,278
You going to let me
borrow another one?

349
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,358
Yeah, totally.

350
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:21,438
I think my favourite
was The Speckled Band.

351
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:22,278
Yeah, that was awesome.

352
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,398
Yeah, that was great, man.
I loved it.

353
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:26,390
- Who knew? All this time.
- I know.

354
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,738
Sherlock Holmes.

355
00:29:28,076 --> 00:29:29,046
I knew.

356
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:30,908
Yeah. I guess so.

357
00:29:32,681 --> 00:29:34,158
Did you just get here?

358
00:29:34,427 --> 00:29:36,394
No, I've been out
backed up with snow.

359
00:29:36,687 --> 00:29:37,990
Oh, my God, I hate that.

360
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,359
Yeah, it sucks.

361
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:54,279
I'm severely suffering
from post-lunch fatigue.

362
00:29:55,234 --> 00:29:56,184
Yeah.

363
00:29:59,225 --> 00:30:02,166
You look...contemplative.

364
00:30:02,797 --> 00:30:04,426
What are you thinking about?

365
00:30:06,276 --> 00:30:08,238
Well, er, nothing, man.

366
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:10,478
I just wanted to ask you
if it's really cool

367
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:13,611
if I take Rachel to the Star Trek
convention tomorrow.

368
00:30:13,731 --> 00:30:15,158
Yeah, of course.

369
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,159
I know she's your ex-girlfriend
and everything.

370
00:30:18,752 --> 00:30:20,346
I'm not bothered by it.

371
00:30:20,577 --> 00:30:23,278
I don't want you to think
we're on a date or anything.

372
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:24,799
It makes me uncomfortable.

373
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,799
I'm totally fine with it.

374
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:30,782
And you guys are dorks.

375
00:30:31,016 --> 00:30:32,715
All right, I'm heading in.

376
00:30:32,973 --> 00:30:34,079
All right.

377
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:22,460
What's up?

378
00:32:22,706 --> 00:32:23,838
Hey, what's going on?

379
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:25,478
Not much, man. What's happening?

380
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:26,798
Nothing.

381
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:28,838
Did you go to the convention?

382
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:30,478
Yeah, man. Did you talk to Rachel?

383
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:31,638
No.

384
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:33,318
It was pretty fucking great, man.

385
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:35,161
We met Marina Sirtis.

386
00:32:35,489 --> 00:32:38,159
You know Marc Alaimo, who plays
Gul Dukat on Deep Space Nine?

387
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,199
- He was there.
- I don't know who that is.

388
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,358
Gul Dukat, man!

389
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:44,096
One of the best characters
in Star Trek. He's amazing.

390
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,718
I got a signed 8 x 10.
Pretty fucking great.

391
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,598
Did Rachel get one?

392
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,765
Yeah, except hers
says, "To a lovely lady",

393
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,280
because she's a chick, you know.

394
00:32:52,797 --> 00:32:54,563
Anyway, we went to her
hotel room after

395
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:56,500
to watch an episode
of Next Generation.

396
00:32:57,719 --> 00:32:58,918
It was cool, it was chilled.

397
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,199
We just hung out, watched it
and went home, no big deal.

398
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,998
Yeah, that's cool.

399
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:06,118
You never told me
she was into baseball.

400
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:07,659
Is she into baseball?

401
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:09,238
I don't think so, man.

402
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,838
Well, we didn't talk about it,

403
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:12,958
but she had a stat books
thing on her night stand.

404
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:14,453
- Really?
- Yeah.

405
00:33:14,855 --> 00:33:17,518
That's weird. I used to try to
get her to go see the White Sox

406
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:19,478
all the time, and she never
wanted to go.

407
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:22,288
I don't know, I guess you
rubbed off on her or something.

408
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:24,118
So, hey, I wanted to tell you.

409
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:26,189
You should come and see me
spin on Saturday.

410
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:27,558
I think Rachel's coming too.

411
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:28,718
What time is it?

412
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,118
Eight o'clock.

413
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:31,718
You go on at eight?

414
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:33,998
Yeah, yeah. I'm not the main DJ.

415
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,497
Shit, that's early.

416
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:38,759
Yeah, well, you should come out,
man. It'll be fun.

417
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:42,438
I don't know.
There's a Blazers game.

418
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:46,785
Why don't you blow off your DJ gig
and come to my house?

419
00:33:47,796 --> 00:33:49,167
Yeah, right!

420
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:51,507
You should come, man.

421
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,027
- I highly recommend it.
- We'll see.

422
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:55,948
- All right, bro.
- Bye.

423
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,816
OK.

424
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,915
The new goal is to just see it
splatter.

425
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:05,838
Not to hit a mark.

426
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:08,118
We'll just see how much
we can splatter the grape.

427
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,638
Am I allowed to, like,
rough it up beforehand?

428
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:11,700
Yeah.

429
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,729
OK.

430
00:34:19,799 --> 00:34:21,798
It was already broken
before it left your hand!

431
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:23,158
Yeah, I know. That's all right.

432
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:24,839
That's not against the rules.

433
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,751
Oh, that was beautiful!

434
00:34:29,327 --> 00:34:33,382
If you open it, squeeze a little out
and get it juicy.

435
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:38,322
Oh, hit the wire, though.
That was fun!

436
00:34:38,442 --> 00:34:39,681
At least you dropped it.

437
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:56,098
Erm, so, guess
what I'm doing tonight?

438
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:57,496
What?

439
00:34:57,743 --> 00:34:59,295
You can't make fun of me.

440
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:00,798
I won't make fun of you.

441
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:02,416
You might, actually.

442
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:04,193
What are you doing?

443
00:35:05,126 --> 00:35:06,251
Erm...

444
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,268
..I'm going on a date.

445
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:12,091
So?

446
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,841
All right. I thought you'd
make fun of me.

447
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,904
Who are you going on a date with?

448
00:35:18,354 --> 00:35:20,053
This guy named Swen.

449
00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:22,887
Swen?

450
00:35:23,602 --> 00:35:25,225
- What?
- That's his name?

451
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,758
How do you know him?

452
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:32,386
He works across the street from me,
in an internet advertising company.

453
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:34,359
Is he nice?

454
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:35,674
Yeah, he's nice.

455
00:35:36,382 --> 00:35:37,838
So, where are you going?

456
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:39,678
I don't know. I don't know
if it's a date.

457
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:41,318
We're just going to
see this band play.

458
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,494
He works with these girls.
I don't know.

459
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:46,438
I mean, I don't really talk
to him, ever,

460
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:47,718
or hang out with him.

461
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,614
So I guess it's probably a date.

462
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:51,991
Yeah, that's a date.

463
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,279
Yeah.

464
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:51,948
'It's Carlos, man. Let me up.'

465
00:36:52,068 --> 00:36:54,013
Dude, it's late as hell.

466
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:56,797
'It's an emergency.
Please, just let me up.'

467
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,601
All right, hang on.

468
00:37:13,128 --> 00:37:14,638
I called you five times, man.

469
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:15,998
I was asleep.

470
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:17,758
Five fucking times.

471
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:19,278
Jesus, what?

472
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:20,318
It's Rachel.

473
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:21,398
What about her?

474
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,638
She said she'd come to my show
tonight and she didn't.

475
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:24,678
She just didn't show.

476
00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:26,038
So what?

477
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:27,478
She said she'd come for sure.

478
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,278
She went out of her way
to call me to say

479
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:30,838
she was definitely
going to come.

480
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:31,918
OK.

481
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:34,198
So I called her after my set,
and she didn't answer,

482
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:37,350
and then I keep trying to call her,
but it goes straight to voicemail.

483
00:37:37,643 --> 00:37:39,221
This is what you woke me up for?

484
00:37:39,455 --> 00:37:41,718
It's just weird, man!
I went over to her motel room

485
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,358
and all the lights were on in her
room, but when I knocked, no answer.

486
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:46,758
She's probably asleep.

487
00:37:46,979 --> 00:37:48,838
Why were all the lights on, then?

488
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:51,478
I don't know, Carlos. The lights are
on in here and I was asleep.

489
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,371
Well, how come she didn't
answer her phone?

490
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:55,038
How the hell should I know?

491
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:58,311
Just... It just doesn't
make sense, man.

492
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:02,758
Goddamn, dude, how much Sherlock
Holmes have you been reading?

493
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:04,818
This has nothing to do
with Sherlock Holmes!

494
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:10,638
I just got this weird feeling when I
was standing outside her motel room.

495
00:38:10,759 --> 00:38:12,078
Weird feeling about what?

496
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,838
I need you to go over there with me.

497
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:14,798
I'm not going over there!

498
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:16,638
Dude, you know about
these kinds of things!

499
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:18,038
What kinds of things?

500
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:19,409
Mysteries.

501
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:07,118
Hey, man, the light was on before.

502
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:09,679
So what? What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

503
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:13,758
Do you ever think that maybe
you shouldn't be snooping around?

504
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:14,678
Ssssh! Quiet!

505
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:16,310
Quiet. You be quiet!

506
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:18,878
Man, the door's open.

507
00:39:19,196 --> 00:39:21,478
So? Was it closed before?

508
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:22,953
Yeah.

509
00:39:28,146 --> 00:39:29,224
Rachel?

510
00:39:29,344 --> 00:39:30,963
Hello? Can you not go in there?

511
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:32,271
Are you serious?

512
00:39:45,693 --> 00:39:47,011
It's just weird.

513
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:50,048
Didn't I tell you something
weird was going on?

514
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:51,812
Maybe she checked out.

515
00:39:52,565 --> 00:39:53,998
Maybe something came up.

516
00:39:54,328 --> 00:39:55,535
Like what?

517
00:39:56,105 --> 00:39:57,335
I don't know, man.

518
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:00,438
Maybe going to see you play
isn't that important.

519
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:02,718
All I'm saying is that she told
me she was going to come

520
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:04,267
even if you decided to stay home.

521
00:40:04,387 --> 00:40:05,609
OK, fine.

522
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:13,589
What are we supposed to do?

523
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:16,499
I don't know. I just feel like
we've got to do something.

524
00:40:25,058 --> 00:40:26,616
Is there anything in there?

525
00:40:26,923 --> 00:40:29,982
Her phone charger.
She left her cellphone charger.

526
00:40:56,919 --> 00:40:58,194
Are we done here?

527
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:02,444
I don't know.

528
00:41:04,452 --> 00:41:06,061
I'm sorry, man, I don't know.

529
00:41:06,181 --> 00:41:08,022
Maybe she went to get a drink.

530
00:41:09,406 --> 00:41:12,078
Maybe she went to another place,
maybe she hated her hotel room.

531
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,763
Maybe she went back to Chicago.

532
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:17,998
There's really nothing out
of the ordinary in here, man.

533
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:20,260
This isn't the most suspicious
environment.

534
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:40,764
Don't react to anything
I'm about to tell you.

535
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:42,498
Just stay still.

536
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:46,588
OK.

537
00:41:48,952 --> 00:41:51,671
There's a guy in a pick-up truck
in the parking lot.

538
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:53,258
What?

539
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:56,903
There's a guy in a pick-up truck
parked in the parking lot.

540
00:41:58,039 --> 00:41:59,350
And he's watching us.

541
00:42:03,433 --> 00:42:05,226
No, no, no, Carlos!

542
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:24,065
Fuck!
Did you see that?

543
00:42:24,185 --> 00:42:25,299
Yes.

544
00:42:25,924 --> 00:42:27,460
Who the fuck was that?

545
00:42:27,695 --> 00:42:29,038
How the hell should I know?

546
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:30,918
I told you something fucked up
was going on!

547
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,251
I'm sorry. I thought
you were overreacting.

548
00:42:33,578 --> 00:42:34,665
What do we do?

549
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:36,062
I don't know.

550
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,958
We've got to find Rachel.

551
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,333
I agree. I don't know
where to start looking.

552
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:44,958
You know what we need?
We need common sense.

553
00:42:45,078 --> 00:42:47,079
- Common sense?
- We've got to call your sister.

554
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:48,478
No, we're not calling my sister.

555
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:49,518
Why not?

556
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:51,509
- She's on a date.
- So what?

557
00:42:51,759 --> 00:42:53,254
No, we're not calling my sister.

558
00:43:14,656 --> 00:43:15,992
You know...

559
00:43:16,439 --> 00:43:20,758
I think...I remember
hearing about a situation

560
00:43:20,879 --> 00:43:23,133
that was actually a little bit
like this.

561
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,932
A situation like what?

562
00:43:29,312 --> 00:43:31,979
A situation, you know,
where people disappear

563
00:43:32,225 --> 00:43:36,900
and there aren't any clues,
it's a dead-end, and...

564
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:40,005
Thanks.

565
00:43:40,255 --> 00:43:41,534
Any food?

566
00:43:42,038 --> 00:43:43,772
No, man. Coffee's fine.

567
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:50,557
I can't remember.
I think maybe they use DNA.

568
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:55,142
Or... I think that was
a different article.

569
00:43:58,114 --> 00:44:01,442
Maybe they never actually found him.
Not the one I'm thinking of.

570
00:44:33,567 --> 00:44:34,587
Shit.

571
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:37,130
What do we do?

572
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:54,905
Hello.

573
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:56,198
How are you?

574
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,558
Good evening.
What can I help you guys with?

575
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:00,598
Er, we'd like to get a room.

576
00:45:01,044 --> 00:45:02,118
A room?

577
00:45:02,238 --> 00:45:03,149
Yeah.

578
00:45:03,269 --> 00:45:04,415
What kind of room?

579
00:45:05,482 --> 00:45:08,869
I actually stayed in this
hotel before, in room 35,

580
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:11,716
and I had a really good
experience in there.

581
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,678
So if I could get that room again,
that would be really nice.

582
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:15,995
35.

583
00:45:21,197 --> 00:45:23,822
Er, it's occupied, so...

584
00:45:26,115 --> 00:45:27,369
..something else?

585
00:45:31,977 --> 00:45:34,157
Do you think I could have room 34?

586
00:45:56,577 --> 00:45:57,889
Meet me at the door.

587
00:45:58,009 --> 00:45:58,979
All right.

588
00:46:24,488 --> 00:46:26,785
All right, where do we start?

589
00:46:29,999 --> 00:46:31,198
You want to try the phone?

590
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:32,278
The phone?

591
00:46:32,399 --> 00:46:33,518
Redial.

592
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:35,079
Yeah, good idea.

593
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:47,607
Never mind. Thank you.

594
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,038
What happened?

595
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:50,855
It's the front desk.

596
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:52,452
Anything in there?

597
00:46:52,686 --> 00:46:55,650
No. Apple core, boarding pass.

598
00:46:58,665 --> 00:46:59,801
What's that?

599
00:47:00,912 --> 00:47:02,506
Look, look, look.

600
00:47:04,386 --> 00:47:05,998
That's her handwriting.

601
00:47:06,408 --> 00:47:07,826
Rachel's handwriting?

602
00:47:08,642 --> 00:47:10,464
Crown Motel, Amanda Brooke.

603
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:11,742
Amanda Brooke?

604
00:47:11,976 --> 00:47:13,652
Who the hell's Amanda Brooke?

605
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:15,493
I don't know.

606
00:47:15,808 --> 00:47:17,616
Well, we're at the Crown Motel.

607
00:47:25,292 --> 00:47:27,118
I'm going to find
the number for the motel.

608
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:28,639
Why?

609
00:47:30,399 --> 00:47:32,639
I'm going to call and ask
for Amanda Brooke.

610
00:47:47,999 --> 00:47:48,994
Hello?

611
00:47:49,275 --> 00:47:50,918
Hi, yeah.

612
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,798
I need you to put me
in touch with a guest.

613
00:47:54,017 --> 00:47:55,634
Her name's Amanda Brooke.

614
00:47:58,611 --> 00:47:59,830
Thank you.

615
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:22,085
What are you looking for?

616
00:48:22,205 --> 00:48:23,429
A pencil.

617
00:48:24,495 --> 00:48:26,171
What do you need a pencil for?

618
00:48:26,479 --> 00:48:28,126
There's a thing with the notepad.

619
00:48:36,796 --> 00:48:40,158
7206,

620
00:48:40,279 --> 00:48:42,008
218,

621
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:44,467
367, 418.

622
00:48:45,286 --> 00:48:46,880
What is that?

623
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:49,548
It's like a...

624
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:51,997
Is that a code, or something?

625
00:48:57,719 --> 00:48:58,794
Hello, again.

626
00:48:58,914 --> 00:49:00,121
Hello, again.

627
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:05,986
I'm sorry to bother you,
but we actually want to check out.

628
00:49:06,439 --> 00:49:07,438
Check out?

629
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:11,438
Yeah. I mean, we can pay full price
or whatever,

630
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:15,487
but we don't need this room any more.

631
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:17,753
That's weird.

632
00:49:18,392 --> 00:49:19,521
Weird in what way?

633
00:49:19,641 --> 00:49:22,050
Well, you're the second person
to do that tonight.

634
00:49:22,284 --> 00:49:23,315
Do what?

635
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,118
Check into this room, 34,
and then check right out again.

636
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:28,470
Some cowboy did the
same thing earlier.

637
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:30,369
Cowboy?

638
00:49:30,628 --> 00:49:32,878
Yeah, cowboy hat.

639
00:49:34,085 --> 00:49:35,890
Oh, damn.

640
00:49:39,061 --> 00:49:40,418
You know what?

641
00:49:40,538 --> 00:49:42,558
I think I forgot something
in the room.

642
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:47,078
I'm actually going to take
this and head back up.

643
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:49,438
We'll be back in a little bit.

644
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:50,918
Sorry.

645
00:49:51,038 --> 00:49:52,032
Thank you.

646
00:50:39,759 --> 00:50:41,359
Look at this.

647
00:50:44,054 --> 00:50:45,086
No.

648
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:46,877
That.

649
00:50:47,479 --> 00:50:48,626
Jim.

650
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,087
Hey. You waiting to get in?

651
00:52:22,803 --> 00:52:23,940
Good morning.

652
00:52:24,439 --> 00:52:25,599
Good morning.

653
00:52:27,407 --> 00:52:29,438
I thought you'd changed
to the day shift?

654
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:30,558
I did.

655
00:52:30,679 --> 00:52:32,055
Why aren't you at work?

656
00:52:33,263 --> 00:52:34,634
I called in sick.

657
00:52:35,803 --> 00:52:37,069
What are you doing?

658
00:52:37,999 --> 00:52:39,702
Reading about breaking codes.

659
00:52:40,496 --> 00:52:41,838
Breaking codes?

660
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:44,199
Why are you reading
about breaking codes?

661
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,083
Doug, did you actually
go to this website?

662
00:53:19,097 --> 00:53:21,429
- What website?
- The website on the card.

663
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:23,442
Look, look.

664
00:53:23,793 --> 00:53:25,358
Amanda Brooke.

665
00:53:26,524 --> 00:53:27,966
Amanda Brooke.

666
00:53:36,844 --> 00:53:38,389
Click on "Yes, let me in".

667
00:53:43,006 --> 00:53:44,638
It wants me to join.

668
00:53:44,759 --> 00:53:45,788
Go back.

669
00:53:49,999 --> 00:53:51,078
Scroll down a little.

670
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:52,700
Take the free tour.

671
00:53:54,075 --> 00:53:57,245
You seem pretty familiar
with how this kind of site works.

672
00:53:57,957 --> 00:53:59,246
Just click on it.

673
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:28,677
- Hey, Gail.
- What?

674
00:54:28,959 --> 00:54:31,079
Would you mind if
I smoked a pipe in here?

675
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:33,865
You have a pipe?

676
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:35,855
No, but I'm going to go buy one,
I think.

677
00:54:35,975 --> 00:54:37,393
You're going to buy a pipe?

678
00:54:38,438 --> 00:54:39,558
Yeah.

679
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:42,607
Sherlock Holmes smokes a pipe
to help him think.

680
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,928
Not a ridiculous, stupid, enormous
one like Basil Rathbone,

681
00:54:46,048 --> 00:54:47,618
but he does have one.

682
00:55:01,463 --> 00:55:03,958
Hello, there. Welcome to Broadway
Tobacco. I'm Virgil.

683
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:04,678
Hi. Doug.

684
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:05,718
Hi, Doug.

685
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:06,438
Nice to meet you.

686
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:07,478
Nice to meet you.

687
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:08,958
What can I do for you today?

688
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:11,118
I'm looking for a pipe.

689
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:13,478
What type of pipe
are you looking for?

690
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,087
I'm not really sure.

691
00:55:15,799 --> 00:55:16,948
Erm...

692
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:21,199
What appeals to you?

693
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:25,118
What about that one,
second in from the right?

694
00:55:25,526 --> 00:55:27,893
That's a Georgia.
That's a very nice pipe.

695
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:30,998
How's that feel in your hands?

696
00:55:31,318 --> 00:55:32,501
It's nice.

697
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,206
How much is this?

698
00:55:35,326 --> 00:55:36,639
$465.

699
00:55:40,586 --> 00:55:44,617
Actually, I was looking for something
more like around $20.

700
00:55:47,056 --> 00:55:48,368
Are they all that expensive?

701
00:55:48,614 --> 00:55:51,118
We've probably got one
down there for you.

702
00:55:51,378 --> 00:55:52,843
This one here.

703
00:55:55,159 --> 00:55:56,839
That one might be in your budget.

704
00:55:58,815 --> 00:56:00,214
How does that feel?

705
00:56:00,519 --> 00:56:01,479
It's OK.

706
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:05,998
You know how the other one has,
like, that hook?

707
00:56:08,931 --> 00:56:10,232
I kind of like that.

708
00:56:11,792 --> 00:56:14,390
Yeah, the design of them
makes them more expensive.

709
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:15,565
Yeah.

710
00:56:16,399 --> 00:56:18,478
I guess this one's pretty
utilitarian, huh?

711
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:19,688
Yes, it is.

712
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,318
Oh, shit!

713
00:56:34,439 --> 00:56:35,398
What?

714
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:36,679
I forgot to get tobacco.

715
00:56:47,245 --> 00:56:49,858
- They had it?
- Yeah. And look.

716
00:56:50,165 --> 00:56:51,879
- What's that?
- It's the magazine.

717
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:53,518
Why do you need that?

718
00:56:53,639 --> 00:56:54,893
Maybe there's clues.

719
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,016
Is it good?

720
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:21,538
Mmm. It's OK.

721
00:57:24,679 --> 00:57:26,441
It's not really helping me think.

722
00:59:03,259 --> 00:59:04,019
Gail!

723
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:05,098
What?

724
00:59:05,219 --> 00:59:06,779
Why didn't you answer?
I just called you!

725
00:59:06,899 --> 00:59:07,538
I didn't know you rang.

726
00:59:07,659 --> 00:59:09,138
You and Carlos.
Why didn't you answer?

727
00:59:09,259 --> 00:59:10,218
I didn't hear it!

728
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:12,049
Listen, I have it!
I figured it out.

729
00:59:12,169 --> 00:59:13,034
What?

730
00:59:13,154 --> 00:59:14,783
The numbers. Baseball stats!

731
00:59:15,259 --> 00:59:15,898
What?

732
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:18,458
The numbers. It's batting average
and on base.

733
00:59:18,579 --> 00:59:20,698
You know how the first number's
smaller than the rest?

734
00:59:20,819 --> 00:59:22,818
I knew Rachel didn't like baseball!

735
00:59:22,939 --> 00:59:24,807
She's using that book
like a code book.

736
00:59:24,927 --> 00:59:27,138
The first number in that
set of numbers is 70.

737
00:59:27,259 --> 00:59:28,298
1970.

738
00:59:28,419 --> 00:59:30,138
Then all the other ones
are in two and three hundreds.

739
00:59:30,259 --> 00:59:31,898
That's because they're baseball stats

740
00:59:32,019 --> 00:59:33,658
and they correspond to
a certain player.

741
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:36,058
I guess you add them up and
maybe it spells something out.

742
00:59:36,389 --> 00:59:37,820
I didn't figure that part out yet.

743
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,395
You've got to take me
to the library now.

744
01:00:09,482 --> 01:00:10,642
This is it.

745
01:00:20,566 --> 01:00:22,058
Clete Boyer.

746
01:00:22,179 --> 01:00:23,622
B O Y E R.

747
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:28,202
Batting average, 287.

748
01:00:29,228 --> 01:00:30,529
On base, 367.

749
01:00:35,414 --> 01:00:36,865
Bob Robertson.

750
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:39,778
Batting, 270.

751
01:00:40,171 --> 01:00:41,503
326.

752
01:00:42,293 --> 01:00:43,858
Al Oliver.

753
01:00:44,376 --> 01:00:45,898
Batting, 270.

754
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:48,030
266, 367.

755
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:54,612
Let's say it's the first letter
of the first name of a player.

756
01:00:55,339 --> 01:01:00,338
So we have L-J-I-B-B-H.

757
01:01:00,691 --> 01:01:02,658
That doesn't sound like anything.

758
01:01:02,779 --> 01:01:05,659
All right. First letter
of last names.

759
01:01:06,619 --> 01:01:10,258
T-H-R-E-E-P-M.

760
01:01:11,075 --> 01:01:12,313
3pm.

761
01:01:12,653 --> 01:01:14,294
3pm, all right.

762
01:01:14,739 --> 01:01:16,838
S-U-N-S-E.

763
01:01:17,459 --> 01:01:20,538
B-R - 3pm - S-U-N-S-E...

764
01:01:20,659 --> 01:01:22,060
Sun. Sunday?

765
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:23,664
- Sunday.
- Sunday.

766
01:01:23,784 --> 01:01:26,616
3pm, Sunday. Today.

767
01:01:28,141 --> 01:01:30,211
It's 2.48 right now.

768
01:01:30,739 --> 01:01:31,618
All right.

769
01:01:31,739 --> 01:01:33,135
S-E, hold on.

770
01:01:33,543 --> 01:01:36,058
S-E-B-R-O-O-K.

771
01:01:36,179 --> 01:01:37,818
S-E, South East Brook.

772
01:01:37,939 --> 01:01:39,098
Southeast Brooklyn.

773
01:01:39,219 --> 01:01:40,498
Southeast Brooklyn Street!

774
01:01:40,619 --> 01:01:41,698
We've got to go.

775
01:01:41,819 --> 01:01:42,978
But we don't have the cross street.

776
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:44,898
Doesn't matter. We got to go.
Bring this book.

777
01:01:45,019 --> 01:01:46,980
I have to check it out first, Doug.

778
01:02:28,455 --> 01:02:29,961
What is that?

779
01:02:31,326 --> 01:02:32,614
It's a knife.

780
01:02:32,899 --> 01:02:35,062
Doug, why do you have a knife?

781
01:02:35,658 --> 01:02:36,947
Just in case.

782
01:02:38,647 --> 01:02:40,178
Doug, give me the knife, please.

783
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:40,898
No!

784
01:02:41,019 --> 01:02:41,618
Doug!

785
01:02:41,739 --> 01:02:42,939
I'm going down there.

786
01:02:43,244 --> 01:02:45,037
I'll be right back.
I'm just going to...

787
01:02:46,899 --> 01:02:48,101
It's fine.

788
01:02:48,619 --> 01:02:49,459
Doug!

789
01:04:27,754 --> 01:04:28,891
'61.'

790
01:04:30,891 --> 01:04:31,922
Doug!

791
01:04:32,339 --> 01:04:33,378
What?

792
01:04:33,499 --> 01:04:34,776
'..357.

793
01:04:35,198 --> 01:04:36,338
Hello?

794
01:04:36,459 --> 01:04:37,699
'42.'

795
01:04:37,819 --> 01:04:38,849
'301.'

796
01:04:38,969 --> 01:04:40,388
Doug, it's Rachel!

797
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:42,057
'242.'

798
01:05:09,736 --> 01:05:11,143
What the fuck are you doing, Doug?

799
01:05:11,263 --> 01:05:13,296
What the fuck am I doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

800
01:05:13,416 --> 01:05:14,418
Me?

801
01:05:14,539 --> 01:05:16,338
Yeah! Why are you checked in
with a fake name?

802
01:05:16,459 --> 01:05:18,298
You said you were training
for a law office job!

803
01:05:18,419 --> 01:05:21,023
- What are you doing snooping around?
- You lied to me.

804
01:05:21,433 --> 01:05:22,858
Tell me what the fuck is going on.

805
01:05:22,979 --> 01:05:24,698
I already figured out
most of it anyway.

806
01:05:24,819 --> 01:05:27,822
Amanda Brooke, Sunday, 3pm,
Southeast Brooklyn.

807
01:05:28,146 --> 01:05:30,178
I did some investigating,
and I've concluded that

808
01:05:30,299 --> 01:05:32,339
you're involved in
some fucked-up shit!

809
01:05:34,101 --> 01:05:37,066
Don't walk away and try to blow me
off. I'm trying to help you.

810
01:05:38,572 --> 01:05:39,814
Let me help you.

811
01:05:41,736 --> 01:05:42,939
Fine.

812
01:05:47,192 --> 01:05:49,078
I was watching the phone.

813
01:05:49,772 --> 01:05:52,385
I found a place where I could see
the phone and not be seen.

814
01:05:53,022 --> 01:05:54,418
Why didn't you want to be seen?

815
01:05:54,539 --> 01:05:56,640
Because I don't have what I'm
supposed to have.

816
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,635
What are you supposed to have?

817
01:05:59,266 --> 01:06:02,266
I got sent here from Chicago
with a briefcase of money.

818
01:06:02,499 --> 01:06:05,183
What do you mean? Like an actual
briefcase full of money?

819
01:06:05,431 --> 01:06:06,553
How much money?

820
01:06:06,673 --> 01:06:08,378
I don't know. The briefcase
was locked.

821
01:06:08,499 --> 01:06:09,625
Who was it for?

822
01:06:09,745 --> 01:06:11,151
I don't know, exactly.

823
01:06:11,963 --> 01:06:14,190
Well, what do you know
about what happened to it?

824
01:06:14,499 --> 01:06:17,312
I went out for a couple of minutes
to get some coffee,

825
01:06:17,593 --> 01:06:19,444
and when I got back, it was gone.

826
01:06:20,339 --> 01:06:21,818
Did you notice anything else gone?

827
01:06:21,939 --> 01:06:23,115
Anything move?

828
01:06:23,235 --> 01:06:25,698
No, I don't think so.
I don't know.

829
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:27,127
Did anybody know you had it?

830
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:28,615
I don't know.

831
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:36,150
Do you know a Jim?

832
01:06:38,241 --> 01:06:41,452
Somebody named Jim ate Chinese
food in the room next to yours.

833
01:06:43,649 --> 01:06:45,098
Jim Warden.

834
01:06:45,219 --> 01:06:46,618
Who's Jim Warden?

835
01:06:46,739 --> 01:06:49,178
He's the one who set this whole
thing up in the first place.

836
01:06:49,399 --> 01:06:51,215
He's a photographer from Chicago.

837
01:06:52,579 --> 01:06:54,791
You go to his apartment
and take photos.

838
01:06:55,117 --> 01:06:56,978
Anyway, I needed money again.

839
01:06:57,099 --> 01:06:59,793
Really badly, so I called him.

840
01:07:00,379 --> 01:07:02,538
And he wasn't in Chicago any more,
he moved here.

841
01:07:03,108 --> 01:07:06,018
He said that he had something
better than pictures, that he

842
01:07:06,139 --> 01:07:09,298
had some friends who needed money
moved from Chicago to Portland,

843
01:07:09,419 --> 01:07:12,258
you know, by someone who wasn't
involved, someone neutral,

844
01:07:12,379 --> 01:07:14,205
someone who didn't want
to ask questions.

845
01:07:14,534 --> 01:07:17,030
So I said yes,
and I took the briefcase.

846
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:20,000
And now it's gone.

847
01:07:23,499 --> 01:07:25,338
Well, the people that you're
delivering it to

848
01:07:25,459 --> 01:07:26,898
don't know
that you don't have it.

849
01:07:27,019 --> 01:07:30,578
They want you to drop it off two days
from now, somewhere by Mount Hood.

850
01:07:30,699 --> 01:07:31,905
What are you talking about?

851
01:07:32,025 --> 01:07:33,725
Got the code from the payphone.

852
01:07:34,379 --> 01:07:38,191
Even so, how am I going to find
the briefcase in two days?

853
01:07:38,539 --> 01:07:40,287
This asshole Jim Warden has it.

854
01:07:40,407 --> 01:07:42,259
We'll just have to find him.

855
01:07:43,161 --> 01:07:44,298
I'll find him.

856
01:07:46,014 --> 01:07:47,128
OK.

857
01:08:54,026 --> 01:08:55,018
'Yeah?'

858
01:08:55,315 --> 01:08:57,578
Hey, I need to borrow your car today.

859
01:08:57,698 --> 01:08:58,578
'Huh?'

860
01:08:58,698 --> 01:09:00,752
I need to borrow your car.

861
01:09:01,366 --> 01:09:06,195
'OK, er, can we talk about this when
I get out of the shower, please?'

862
01:09:08,147 --> 01:09:09,589
Yeah, I guess so.

863
01:09:11,267 --> 01:09:12,955
You can borrow my car.

864
01:09:13,895 --> 01:09:15,090
Huh?

865
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:18,689
Yeah, if you need it today,
you can borrow it.

866
01:09:23,179 --> 01:09:24,990
Yeah, but don't you work at 12?

867
01:09:27,034 --> 01:09:28,178
Yeah.

868
01:09:28,734 --> 01:09:30,715
I'm going to need it longer
than that.

869
01:09:32,058 --> 01:09:33,538
Dude, you've got to work, too.

870
01:09:33,659 --> 01:09:35,578
I'm not going in. You'll have to
say I'm still sick.

871
01:09:35,699 --> 01:09:37,531
Why, what's going on?

872
01:09:37,807 --> 01:09:39,067
Look at this.

873
01:09:42,739 --> 01:09:44,298
Look at the photo credit.

874
01:09:44,692 --> 01:09:45,665
Yeah?

875
01:09:45,922 --> 01:09:47,211
It's Jim Warden.

876
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:49,818
The alleged cowboy.

877
01:09:49,939 --> 01:09:52,845
Rachel said that he shoots
out of his apartment,

878
01:09:52,965 --> 01:09:54,552
at least he did in Chicago,

879
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:57,663
and this is the most recent
issue of this magazine,

880
01:09:57,783 --> 01:09:59,336
so I can only assume
that this picture

881
01:09:59,456 --> 01:10:01,343
was taken from his
apartment here.

882
01:10:02,486 --> 01:10:03,514
So what?

883
01:10:03,634 --> 01:10:05,299
So look at the picture.

884
01:10:06,481 --> 01:10:08,450
It's a naked chick, man.

885
01:10:08,755 --> 01:10:10,208
Look out the window.

886
01:10:19,621 --> 01:10:20,825
It's a palm tree.

887
01:10:20,945 --> 01:10:22,098
Exactly.

888
01:10:22,219 --> 01:10:24,619
How many palm trees do you
know of in Portland?

889
01:10:29,282 --> 01:10:30,428
Not many.

890
01:10:30,548 --> 01:10:31,356
Right?

891
01:10:31,476 --> 01:10:32,519
Yeah.

892
01:10:35,371 --> 01:10:36,578
Right.

893
01:11:28,898 --> 01:11:30,263
Did you find anything?

894
01:11:30,761 --> 01:11:32,020
Yeah, he definitely lives here.

895
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:33,565
His name's on the buzzer.

896
01:11:41,859 --> 01:11:44,418
I feel like we should have
pistachios or something.

897
01:11:44,872 --> 01:11:46,966
Isn't that what people
do on stakeouts?

898
01:11:47,994 --> 01:11:49,330
I don't know.

899
01:11:50,427 --> 01:11:52,420
Yeah, we should have pistachios.

900
01:11:53,456 --> 01:11:55,273
There might be food in the glove box.

901
01:12:06,299 --> 01:12:07,471
Swedish fish.

902
01:12:09,059 --> 01:12:10,007
Want one?

903
01:12:10,127 --> 01:12:11,815
No, they get stuck in my teeth.

904
01:12:21,928 --> 01:12:24,014
What we going to do
if we see this guy?

905
01:12:25,537 --> 01:12:26,814
Follow him.

906
01:12:34,018 --> 01:12:36,244
I feel like we should be doing
something right now.

907
01:12:36,701 --> 01:12:37,815
Nah.

908
01:12:38,779 --> 01:12:41,451
We've got to hang back.
Just wait.

909
01:12:53,094 --> 01:12:56,390
Man, I feel like somebody
should be with Rachel.

910
01:12:58,151 --> 01:12:59,745
Can you blow off work?

911
01:13:03,249 --> 01:13:04,409
Yeah, man.

912
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:49,379
Doug, what's going on?

913
01:14:03,361 --> 01:14:04,545
Hey.

914
01:14:07,119 --> 01:14:08,558
Took a long time.

915
01:14:08,679 --> 01:14:10,580
Yeah, the bus was really slow.

916
01:14:12,279 --> 01:14:13,718
Has anything happened yet?

917
01:14:13,839 --> 01:14:15,118
Not a thing.

918
01:14:15,239 --> 01:14:16,505
Are you sure this is
the right place?

919
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:18,067
Yeah, the name's on the buzzer.

920
01:14:22,474 --> 01:14:24,654
I can only be in the driver's seat,
actually.

921
01:14:26,199 --> 01:14:27,814
What difference does it make?

922
01:14:28,371 --> 01:14:31,090
I just feel uncomfortable
when you drive.

923
01:14:55,978 --> 01:14:57,208
Happy now?

924
01:14:58,239 --> 01:14:59,439
Yes.

925
01:15:04,087 --> 01:15:05,977
Maybe we should play a game.

926
01:15:06,097 --> 01:15:07,427
What game?

927
01:15:09,677 --> 01:15:11,039
I don't know. 20 questions?

928
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:14,718
I don't really like those
road trip games.

929
01:15:14,839 --> 01:15:16,701
Well, just talk about something.
I don't know.

930
01:15:31,181 --> 01:15:32,798
I've got a question for you.

931
01:15:34,439 --> 01:15:36,984
And don't get offended,
I'm not trying to make fun of you.

932
01:15:38,212 --> 01:15:39,412
OK.

933
01:15:43,044 --> 01:15:44,767
Do you have any friends?

934
01:15:46,759 --> 01:15:48,081
Of course.

935
01:15:49,181 --> 01:15:51,439
I haven't seen you hanging
out with anyone.

936
01:15:54,759 --> 01:15:57,278
Don't you hang out with anybody
from high school or anything?

937
01:15:57,399 --> 01:15:59,958
No. The only people that are left
from high school

938
01:16:00,079 --> 01:16:02,456
are people I do not want
to hang out with.

939
01:16:06,879 --> 01:16:09,636
I guess I didn't tell you I had
a boyfriend recently, huh?

940
01:16:11,079 --> 01:16:12,078
When?

941
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:15,278
We broke up in November.

942
01:16:15,399 --> 01:16:17,352
- What was his name?
- Sam.

943
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:21,718
How long did you date?

944
01:16:21,839 --> 01:16:22,958
Six months.

945
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:24,678
Six months?
Why didn't you say anything?

946
01:16:24,799 --> 01:16:26,161
I don't know, just...

947
01:16:29,528 --> 01:16:31,344
Where did you meet this guy?

948
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:36,761
I don't really want to say.

949
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:42,903
Did you meet him on the internet?

950
01:16:43,023 --> 01:16:44,558
No... Yes.

951
01:16:46,083 --> 01:16:47,278
What a loser!

952
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:48,598
I know, I know.

953
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:50,038
That's not so bad.

954
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:51,278
It's pretty bad.

955
01:16:51,399 --> 01:16:53,558
I know a kid in Chicago who's
getting married to a girl

956
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:54,638
he met on the internet.

957
01:16:54,759 --> 01:16:57,033
Yeah, I know, it happens a lot,
but it's still weird.

958
01:17:04,121 --> 01:17:05,340
Sam was cool.

959
01:17:07,646 --> 01:17:08,900
I liked Sam.

960
01:17:09,322 --> 01:17:10,752
What happened?

961
01:17:11,759 --> 01:17:14,524
Our first date was walking over
the Hawthorne Bridge.

962
01:17:15,919 --> 01:17:17,506
That's considered a date?

963
01:17:17,626 --> 01:17:20,720
I think that the cool thing about
it, because it's not really a date.

964
01:17:20,959 --> 01:17:24,334
We met at the fountain on Salmon
Street and just walked across.

965
01:17:26,199 --> 01:17:27,278
It was pretty fun.

966
01:17:27,399 --> 01:17:28,438
That's it?

967
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:30,057
Well, we had dinner.

968
01:17:41,093 --> 01:17:43,159
Who's this guy? Look.

969
01:18:03,639 --> 01:18:05,386
Turn the car round.

970
01:19:47,134 --> 01:19:49,641
- We should just park here.
- Yeah, just pull up.

971
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:03,865
- He's got it.
- I know.

972
01:23:32,263 --> 01:23:34,009
He's pulling into a parking space.

973
01:23:34,279 --> 01:23:35,598
What should I do?

974
01:23:35,946 --> 01:23:37,358
Keep driving.

975
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:39,841
Look at that!
That's the truck from the motel.

976
01:23:39,961 --> 01:23:40,977
That's it?

977
01:23:41,097 --> 01:23:42,879
Here, pull up here.
Put into this space.

978
01:24:47,399 --> 01:24:48,581
What should we do?

979
01:24:50,073 --> 01:24:51,233
Think.

980
01:24:52,948 --> 01:24:54,508
We should call the cops.

981
01:24:55,172 --> 01:24:57,605
No. If we call the police, we're
never seeing that briefcase again.

982
01:24:57,851 --> 01:24:59,158
How are you guys doing?

983
01:24:59,279 --> 01:25:00,344
I'm all right.

984
01:25:00,464 --> 01:25:02,198
You need another drink, or...?

985
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:04,918
Er, no.
I think I'm all right.

986
01:25:05,146 --> 01:25:06,436
Good, OK. Let me know.

987
01:25:06,556 --> 01:25:07,639
Thanks.

988
01:25:16,999 --> 01:25:18,479
Looks like they're almost done.

989
01:25:25,999 --> 01:25:27,072
Doug.

990
01:25:27,605 --> 01:25:30,038
Do you think we should just take
the briefcase? Just grab it?

991
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:31,259
No.

992
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:33,838
Why not?
It's just sitting there.

993
01:25:34,131 --> 01:25:36,982
We'll just come out of the bathroom,
and I'll just walk

994
01:25:37,239 --> 01:25:41,518
in between that aisle, and then
I can just grab it and run.

995
01:25:41,639 --> 01:25:42,678
Shouldn't I do it?

996
01:25:42,799 --> 01:25:45,648
No! I am a much faster runner
than you. I ran track.

997
01:25:45,941 --> 01:25:47,764
Listen, you've got to go outside.

998
01:25:47,884 --> 01:25:50,771
You've got to get the car
and just meet me out front.

999
01:25:52,108 --> 01:25:54,118
We have to do this, like, now.

1000
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:56,518
I don't know. I feel our strength is
that we know who they are,

1001
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:59,228
and they don't have a clue who we
are. We should keep it that way.

1002
01:25:59,509 --> 01:26:01,758
Oh, I have an idea.
I have a really good idea.

1003
01:26:02,005 --> 01:26:04,231
Excuse me, ma'am.

1004
01:26:04,351 --> 01:26:06,369
Do you guys have a lost-and-found?

1005
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:07,541
Yeah.

1006
01:26:07,661 --> 01:26:08,878
I was just wondering.

1007
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:11,478
I know this is going to sound
really weird,

1008
01:26:11,599 --> 01:26:13,838
but I'm going to this costume party
later tonight,

1009
01:26:13,959 --> 01:26:15,318
and I don't have a costume,

1010
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:18,078
and I was just wondering if you had
some weird, old

1011
01:26:18,199 --> 01:26:21,238
lost-and-found stuff that's been
sitting there for months.

1012
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:22,518
Yeah.

1013
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:23,558
That's all right?

1014
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:24,598
That's fine.

1015
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:26,038
Whatever's been there longest.

1016
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:28,358
Yeah, we have loads of stuff.
I'll be right back.

1017
01:26:28,479 --> 01:26:30,198
Great. Thank you so much.

1018
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:39,958
All right, give me a dime.

1019
01:26:40,079 --> 01:26:40,718
Why?

1020
01:26:40,839 --> 01:26:43,826
Because I'm going to use it to take
the licence plate off your car.

1021
01:26:44,559 --> 01:26:45,633
Why?

1022
01:26:45,958 --> 01:26:47,338
So then they can't follow us.

1023
01:26:56,646 --> 01:26:59,078
As soon as I leave,
count two minutes.

1024
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:00,225
OK.

1025
01:27:01,096 --> 01:27:02,959
Don't do anything until two minutes.

1026
01:27:06,439 --> 01:27:07,517
You ready?

1027
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:08,958
Keys.

1028
01:27:09,079 --> 01:27:10,319
Oh, yeah.

1029
01:30:00,453 --> 01:30:01,158
Doug!

1030
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:03,020
- What?
- Get in the car!

1031
01:30:17,663 --> 01:30:18,897
What took you so long?

1032
01:30:19,017 --> 01:30:20,383
I don't know!

1033
01:30:20,799 --> 01:30:23,278
I was nervous, and it took me a
minute to get all my nerve to do it.

1034
01:30:23,399 --> 01:30:24,318
All right.

1035
01:30:24,439 --> 01:30:25,598
It wasn't that hard, though.

1036
01:30:25,719 --> 01:30:27,718
It was actually really easy,
I just took it and ran,

1037
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:29,118
and he didn't even expect it.

1038
01:30:29,239 --> 01:30:30,518
Are you all right?

1039
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:33,270
Yeah, yeah. Why did you
get out of the car?

1040
01:30:33,551 --> 01:30:35,189
Because you were taking too long.

1041
01:30:35,486 --> 01:30:36,559
Oh, my God.

1042
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:39,350
Gail. What?

1043
01:30:39,470 --> 01:30:40,674
I slashed their tyres.

1044
01:30:40,794 --> 01:30:43,180
What?! How did you do that?

1045
01:30:43,473 --> 01:30:45,718
I got the idea when I was coming out.

1046
01:30:45,839 --> 01:30:48,078
I figured if I slash his tyres,
they couldn't follow us.

1047
01:30:48,199 --> 01:30:49,653
I told you my knife was useful!

1048
01:30:50,519 --> 01:30:52,118
Wait, I've got to drive slower.

1049
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:54,715
I've got to drive slower, because
I don't want to get pulled over.

1050
01:30:55,039 --> 01:30:57,078
I can't believe we did that.
We just did that.

1051
01:30:57,199 --> 01:30:58,728
Yeah, we totally did.

1052
01:31:02,662 --> 01:31:04,138
OK, wait.

1053
01:31:04,759 --> 01:31:06,783
I'm just going to keep
going straight.

1054
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:37,699
You OK?

1055
01:32:37,819 --> 01:32:39,759
Yeah. Yeah.

1056
01:32:42,847 --> 01:32:46,386
All right. I'm going to call Carlos,
tell him to bring Rachel here.

1057
01:32:46,919 --> 01:32:47,518
OK.

1058
01:32:47,639 --> 01:32:49,003
I'll just be a minute.

1059
01:33:37,213 --> 01:33:38,839
You want to listen to music?

1060
01:33:40,199 --> 01:33:41,238
Yeah.

1061
01:33:42,025 --> 01:33:44,064
I don't know what's on
most of those.

1062
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:49,934
Think they're mostly mix tapes you
made me in high school, actually.

1063
01:34:17,112 --> 01:34:20,393
Hold on. I think there's something
at the beginning you might like.

1064
01:36:20,679 --> 01:36:23,519
