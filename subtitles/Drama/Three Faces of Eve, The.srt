If f sub x...

3
00:01:28,108 --> 00:01:31,972
...x, which is what we were trying to PROVE!

4
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:36,855
Notice the... the elegance of the proof,
it's beautiful!

5
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,302
It actually reminds me
of a quote by Socrates,

6
00:01:39,464 --> 00:01:43,460
"If measure and symmetry are absent
from any composition in any degree,"

7
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,700
"the ruin awaits both the
ingredients and the composition."

8
00:01:48,835 --> 00:01:53,758
"Measure and symmetry are beauty
and virtue the world over."

9
00:01:58,687 --> 00:02:03,156
- He's cute, do you think he's straight?
- Oh, yeah, he's too boring to be gay.

10
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:08,829
- Oh, is it 5:15? Is my watch correct?
- Yes, it is.

11
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,040
Thank you.

12
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:19,216
I'm releasing you a half hour early
today, I have a... a... an appointment.

13
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,577
I'm giving a lecture on my new book
tonight, if you are interested, please see me.

14
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,052
Ah... okay... um.

15
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:30,444
Thank you.

16
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:54,865
<i>Rose, get that mask off your face, it's been
15 minutes, it'll clog your pores.

17
00:02:55,673 --> 00:02:57,942
<i>We're going to be late,
it's almost seven o'clock.

18
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,369
All right, all right.

19
00:03:07,116 --> 00:03:11,294
Ah! You stupid bum! Three million
dollars a year! For what? For what?

20
00:03:11,976 --> 00:03:13,791
C'mon, c'mon, just one more out.

21
00:03:40,059 --> 00:03:43,870
- Barry Neufeld.
- Hi, Barry, it's Rose.

22
00:03:44,143 --> 00:03:47,214
Hi, what... oh, no, not again?

23
00:03:47,249 --> 00:03:51,112
I think it's an allergic reaction
to something I ate, you know.

24
00:03:52,686 --> 00:03:54,664
<i>My throat's starting to close up.

25
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:55,846
Oh!!

26
00:03:55,881 --> 00:03:57,240
It sounds like you're dying.

27
00:03:57,275 --> 00:04:01,648
Rose, it's the third time this month,
are you sure you're not allergic to me?

28
00:04:01,683 --> 00:04:04,673
Barry, please don't think that,
that's a terrible thing to think!

29
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:08,563
I'm going to be blacklisted at every restaurant
in Manhattan for not keeping reservations.

30
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:12,596
Why don't you call me next week?
Okay? If you still want to.

31
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:15,756
- Sure... feel better.
- Thank you.

32
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:16,881
<i>Bye.

33
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:17,730
Bye.

34
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,525
Do you think I should start with a joke?

35
00:04:36,258 --> 00:04:39,508
Oh, oh, you're serious! No, I don't
think so, there's not enough time.

36
00:04:39,543 --> 00:04:42,364
- For what?
- For you to develop a sense of humor.

37
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:49,956
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the author of "Absolute Truth",

38
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:53,795
Columbia's very own
Professor Gregory Larkin.

39
00:04:54,156 --> 00:04:55,836
You're going to be fine.

40
00:05:01,713 --> 00:05:07,189
Thank you, thank you very much, I'm honored
by this warm and gracious welcome.

41
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:13,185
As I stand here at the end of a journey,
I'm reminded of something Descartes once said...

42
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:17,223
"For whether I am awake or asleep, two
and three will always make five,"

43
00:05:17,245 --> 00:05:20,255
"the square can never have more than four sides,"

44
00:05:20,302 --> 00:05:24,265
"and it does not seem possible
that truths so clear and apparent"

45
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,538
"can be suspected of any uncertainty."

46
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,656
<i>This book has taken me
over 14 years to write.

47
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:36,101
And it not without a little sadness that

48
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,561
I say goodbye to it
consuming my days and nights.

49
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:42,972
And nights.

50
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:46,660
<i>And so...

51
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,130
<i>as I stand here...

52
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:57,208
And so, in coming up... "summing" up...

53
00:05:59,963 --> 00:06:03,003
<i>Excuse me,
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

54
00:06:06,044 --> 00:06:11,640
I thought it would feel differently,
I thought I would know more, I don't.

55
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:14,877
<i>I don't know anything, really.

56
00:06:15,956 --> 00:06:18,063
Thank you all for...

57
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:20,517
coming.

58
00:06:27,484 --> 00:06:28,749
Oh, God, what did I say?

59
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:33,629
It was fine, although I'd think twice about
doing volunteer work for a suicide hotline.

60
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:36,002
You were doing okay
until Candice walked in.

61
00:06:36,385 --> 00:06:40,683
Don't start, Henry, I just forgot to eat.
You should never drink on an empty stomach.

62
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:43,566
Listen, it's perfectly natural, she
left you, what, a year ago?

63
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:44,567
It's the stupid wine.

64
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:48,325
Thank God Candy left when she did,
or I never would have finished the book.

65
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:51,425
Thank God Rebecca left,
and Katherine, and Allison.

66
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,168
You're the only guy I know who can't
have sex and chew gum at the same time.

67
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:56,517
- Why does everything have to be about sex?
- Because everything is about sex.

68
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:58,744
Well, when I'm with someone,
when I'm involved with them,

69
00:06:58,828 --> 00:07:01,702
I tend to get a
little sidetracked, that's all.

70
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:06,055
<i>Greg, you call 14 years to write
a book a little sidetracked?

71
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,804
I bet she's still out there.

72
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:08,912
If I know Candice, she's...

73
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,160
No, no, no, no, Henry.

74
00:07:12,971 --> 00:07:16,774
She's out there, come on, face
her like a grown-up, come on.

75
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,996
Do me a favor, Henry, don't let me go home
with her, say we're going out to dinner.

76
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:22,628
We are, it may seem
odd not to invite...

77
00:07:22,688 --> 00:07:25,393
Please Henry, just don't
let me go home with her.

78
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:27,207
All right, all right.

79
00:07:27,565 --> 00:07:30,901
There you are, are you all right?

80
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:35,824
It was that stupid wine. Hello, Candice.

81
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:37,903
- Hi.
- You look great.

82
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:42,066
Thanks, I hope you don't mind me
showing up like this on your big night.

83
00:07:42,557 --> 00:07:46,653
It's just... I've been
thinking so much about you lately.

84
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:49,043
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

85
00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:54,151
- Do you want to go get a drink?
- No, no, I'd better not.

86
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,830
- Wanna grab a bite to eat?
- No, I'm not hungry.

87
00:07:58,071 --> 00:08:00,836
- Do you want me to take you home?
- Okay.

88
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:02,958
Good to see you, Henry.

89
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:06,115
- But Greg, you said...
- Bye, Henry.

90
00:08:08,984 --> 00:08:10,931
<i>Can... Candy, don't... don't leave.

91
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:13,330
<i>- That was great.
- I thought you were going to stay.

92
00:08:13,383 --> 00:08:16,461
<i>- Well, we're done. Is my shoe there?
- I still have feelings for you.

93
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,493
<i>Greg, I dumped you for another man,
how could you still have feelings for me?

94
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:23,675
- Besides, I'm still sort of with Paul.
- I thought that was over.

95
00:08:23,977 --> 00:08:25,519
Yeah, well, he was cheating on me,

96
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:29,343
I guess... I guess I just wanted to feel better
about myself before I see him tomorrow night.

97
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:33,893
- That's why you're here?
- Well, yeah.

98
00:08:34,755 --> 00:08:38,811
Look, you were always such a nice guy,
but let's face it,

99
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:43,372
we had nothing in common except
sex, and the fact you idolize me.

100
00:08:43,531 --> 00:08:47,483
I... I really do care for you... really.

101
00:08:47,796 --> 00:08:47,797
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.

102
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:52,484
- I just can't wind up with you.
- Can I call you sometime?

103
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:55,574
What for?

104
00:09:02,762 --> 00:09:04,571
<i>Rose, you going or what?

105
00:09:04,606 --> 00:09:06,093
No, I cancelled.

106
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,352
<i>So, what do you
want to do for dinner?

107
00:09:08,877 --> 00:09:09,508
What?

108
00:09:09,543 --> 00:09:11,560
<i>Why don't you make that
pasta with the artichokes?

109
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,934
<i>Then maybe later we can figure out what to do
with your hair for Claire's wedding.

110
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:24,062
<i>What is this?

111
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:26,768
Look at this.

112
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:27,420
<i>Escape!

113
00:09:27,472 --> 00:09:28,909
I wish I could escape.

114
00:09:29,471 --> 00:09:33,549
<i>The mating ritual is both speedy and
violent for these passionate insects.

115
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:37,137
<i>The lesser male often covering
the larger female.

116
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:44,302
<i>If unsuccessful in mounting, the male mantis
is often eaten by the females during copulation.

117
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:49,818
<i>We're the girls of 1-400 Hot Talk.

00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:04,332
<i>1-400...

123
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,321
<i>Yeah.

124
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:14,907
<i>So am l.
What are you wearing?

125
00:10:14,908 --> 00:10:17,606
Nothing special.

126
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:19,827
Felicia, can I ask you a question?

127
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,421
<i>Wanna know what I'm
wearing? Just a towel.

128
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:27,127
Ooh, I was drying myself off,
after a hot shower when you called...

129
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:28,760
<i>Felicia, Felicia, why do women leave?

130
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,039
What?

131
00:10:30,074 --> 00:10:32,166
Why do women leave?

132
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,158
<i>Especially beautiful women.

133
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,119
I can't go through this anymore.

134
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:42,485
Life is very complex.
There are no guarantees.

135
00:10:42,486 --> 00:10:43,742
<i>Why should that be?

136
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:46,874
The mathematical world
is completely rational.

137
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,075
<i>Uncomplicated by sex.

138
00:10:48,312 --> 00:10:50,590
- You think too much, Hon.
- Felicia, I...

139
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:52,868
Don't you want to know
how big my tits are?

140
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:58,175
No, no, I... I... I just want
to share my life with someone.

141
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,477
<i>Someone I'm not sexually attracted to.

142
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,238
What?

143
00:11:02,425 --> 00:11:05,426
How can two people come
together for what's a...

144
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:09,022
a lasting and substantial,
mutual respect, genuine affection

145
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:11,413
in a world that's run by
ad agencies selling great sex?

146
00:11:11,414 --> 00:11:13,642
Take out your own ad, I guess.

147
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,799
An ad?

148
00:11:49,484 --> 00:11:52,024
Look at me, I'm a grown woman
wearing a prom dress.

149
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:53,953
You are not, you look adorable.

00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:57,928
Adorable? I look like an over-the-hill
Barbie doll. It doesn't fit right, too tight.

151
00:11:57,929 --> 00:11:59,144
Too many Snoballs.

152
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:01,389
Why didn't you pick
out something looser in my color?

153
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:03,300
Because maids of honor don't wear black.

154
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,398
Now, it would help if you
fixed yourself up a little bit.

155
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:08,473
- Why don't you wear some make-up?
- I AM wearing make-up.

156
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,673
Let's go.

157
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:14,490
<i>And your hair looks good today, I like
it, the curls work, why don't you get a perm?

158
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,274
I tried that once, I look like
Shirley Temple on crack.

159
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:19,908
Where the hell is she?
I'm going to kill her.

160
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:23,005
I knew she would pull something
like this, she just can't stand the fact

161
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,910
that I'M the one getting
all the attention today.

162
00:12:25,068 --> 00:12:27,165
We should have had her
COMMITTED when she turned 60.

163
00:12:27,169 --> 00:12:30,567
Claire, you can't have someone
committed for excessive vanity?

164
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:31,834
<i>Thank you, Rose.

165
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:35,247
How wonderful to have two
compassionate daughters.

166
00:12:35,282 --> 00:12:37,516
I thought you were going
to wear make-up today?

167
00:12:38,063 --> 00:12:39,023
<i>I am wearing make-up.

168
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:39,551
Well?

169
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:40,812
<i>Oh, my God!

170
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:46,262
- What the hell are you wearing?
- This happens to be an imitation Scassi.

171
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,965
You're the mother of the
bride, not the opening ACT.

172
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,660
Fine! I'll go home and change.

173
00:12:50,776 --> 00:12:54,346
Oh, stop it, we're late already,
the priest is sweating.

174
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:57,005
All celibates sweat, Dear,
if they didn't, they'd explode.

175
00:12:57,006 --> 00:12:58,167
Come on, let's go.

176
00:12:58,213 --> 00:13:00,007
I just went to buy myself a
little snack.

177
00:13:00,204 --> 00:13:03,692
I can't sit through this ganze megillah
without eating something, I'll pass out.

178
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,960
- It'll only take 45 minutes.
- It'll feel like 2 hours.

179
00:13:07,132 --> 00:13:09,743
Not to mention that you're marrying
outside your faith, and on the Sabbath.

180
00:13:09,807 --> 00:13:11,606
Oh, Mother, the only
thing you ever taught me

181
00:13:11,686 --> 00:13:13,902
about the Sabbath is that
Bergdorf’s wouldn't be as crowded.

182
00:13:13,937 --> 00:13:15,178
Now, you listen to me!

183
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:16,091
<i>Take it easy, Claire.

184
00:13:16,523 --> 00:13:19,756
I want you to get out there and
I want you to remember today is MY day.

185
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:21,458
And if you don't behave
yourself, I'm gonna have your

186
00:13:21,464 --> 00:13:24,111
birth certificate blown-up
as a Christmas card.

187
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:27,420
I should have never
encouraged you to speak.

188
00:13:38,395 --> 00:13:42,115
Maybe she'll look back
and turn into a pillar of salt.

189
00:13:43,402 --> 00:13:45,103
<i>Hannah looks pretty good for her age.

190
00:13:46,512 --> 00:13:48,306
Alex looks nervous.

191
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,719
Oh, God, I hope I'm
doing the right thing.

192
00:13:53,504 --> 00:13:55,342
I think you are.

193
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,716
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the party is about
to get started. The dance floor is all yours!

194
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:08,971
<i>Okay, Girls, lick your lips, come in close,
come in close, oh, yes, ??? ???. Oh!

195
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,619
Sophia, tell Claire I'm looking for her.

196
00:14:12,777 --> 00:14:14,800
Your husband's a lucky guy.

197
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:23,213
- Waiter! Can we have more dressing?
- We were separated at birth.

198
00:14:23,372 --> 00:14:24,855
Two more drinks, when
you get a chance, please.

199
00:14:24,894 --> 00:14:28,373
- That would be nice.
- Okay, this looks delicious, I'm so happy.

200
00:14:28,815 --> 00:14:33,219
<i>And now, something a little
romantic, for all the lovers tonight.

201
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:33,637
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.

202
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:37,324
<i>- I can't believe he's married.
- I can't believe he chose CLAIRE over you.

203
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:39,971
<i>- I can!
- I told you not to introduce them.

204
00:14:40,038 --> 00:14:42,386
<i>Well, she already had a
husband, I thought it was safe.

205
00:14:45,126 --> 00:14:46,621
So, how are you handling all this?

206
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:50,722
I've learned my lesson... no more
fantasies about good looking men.

207
00:14:50,781 --> 00:14:55,716
- You never know, there's a guy out there somewhere.
- Oh, yeah? Who? Barry Neufeldt?

208
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,880
So, what's wrong with him...

209
00:14:59,338 --> 00:15:02,794
besides that fact that he looks like
Gumpy and he irritates the shit out of you?

210
00:15:02,954 --> 00:15:04,305
- Gumby.
- Gumby.

211
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:05,954
Gumby, not Gumpy.

212
00:15:08,316 --> 00:15:10,521
Why should that matter,
I'm no great prize, either.

213
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:13,992
Don't say that! You are a terrific
person and a great teacher.

214
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:16,809
The truth is I think I've
just reached the point.

215
00:15:16,844 --> 00:15:19,307
- What point?
- The point that you know you'll never get married.

216
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:23,463
Married? What's marriage
anyway? Oh, come on!

217
00:15:23,498 --> 00:15:26,506
A ring, a contract,
fighting and compromising.

218
00:15:27,065 --> 00:15:28,891
No, it can be more than that.

219
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,351
I'll tell you what I... what
I envy about people in love?

220
00:15:32,443 --> 00:15:33,705
Yeah?

221
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,818
I'd love it if someone who
knew me, really knew me.

222
00:15:38,978 --> 00:15:44,556
What I like, what I'm afraid of,
what kind of toothpaste I use.

223
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:48,667
I think that... would really be wonderful.

224
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:54,031
Hey, hey, hey, Sister-in-law.
You having a good time here?

225
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:55,031
Yeah.

226
00:15:55,032 --> 00:15:56,731
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
in honor of the bride's family...

227
00:15:56,813 --> 00:15:58,400
- Have you seen Claire?
- No.

228
00:15:58,401 --> 00:16:01,068
- I can't find her anywhere.
- I'll go find her for you.

229
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:03,925
Oh, thank you, you look
beautiful tonight by the way.

230
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,044
- Right.
- No, I'm not just saying that, you do, you really...

231
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:08,659
l heard you.

232
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:14,223
Why don't you have some coffee?
I'll go find Claire.

233
00:16:17,002 --> 00:16:20,192
Claire, where have you
been, Alex is looking for you.

234
00:16:20,227 --> 00:16:22,579
Oh, brother, it's starting already?

235
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:26,030
How could you do this?
I may never forgive you.

236
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:28,413
I may never forgive you,
but that's another story.

237
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:15,236
Yes! Aw! Yes! Aw!

238
00:17:16,977 --> 00:17:20,973
- Yes!!
- I'm Professor Gregory Larkin.

239
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:22,285
I'm calling about

240
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,611
<i>the response to my ad.
Is this Professor Morgan?

241
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,395
No, no, this is her sister, Rose
doesn't even know I answered the ad.

242
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,722
Oh, well, then maybe...
maybe we shouldn't be talking.

243
00:17:32,847 --> 00:17:35,859
Oh, no, no please, it's... it's just
that Rose would never answer an ad herself.

244
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,873
I mean you know, some of these
guys are such creeps and losers.

245
00:17:39,962 --> 00:17:42,133
<i>But when it said you taught at Columbia,

246
00:17:42,134 --> 00:17:44,305
ya know, something just clicked inside.

247
00:17:45,563 --> 00:17:49,440
- Now, you have seen her picture, right?
- Yes.

248
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,276
- And?
- And what?

249
00:17:54,517 --> 00:17:56,638
Nothing... great.

250
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:08,589
Make way, please.

251
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:21,267
<i>So, this is the scene
at my sister's wedding, right?

252
00:18:21,427 --> 00:18:26,903
<i>There she is getting drunk, regretting
she ever got married... for the third time, mind you.

253
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,361
My mother is so jealous, she's
sprouting snakes from her hair,

254
00:18:30,396 --> 00:18:32,580
and I'm thinking, this is perfect...

255
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:37,587
We've got three feminine archetypes here:
The divine whore... excuse me,

256
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:41,479
Medusa, and me.
Who am I, what archetype?

257
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,122
Trevor.

258
00:18:43,157 --> 00:18:44,832
The Virgin Mary?

259
00:18:45,486 --> 00:18:47,813
Thanks a lot, Trevor.

260
00:18:47,975 --> 00:18:54,331
No, the faithful handmaiden, always
the bridesmaid, never the bride.

261
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:57,291
It does prove, however, what Jung said all along, that

262
00:18:57,451 --> 00:19:02,086
myths and archetypes are alive
and well and living in my apartment.

263
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:09,164
As I... as I stood at the altar beside
my sister and her husband to be,

264
00:19:09,323 --> 00:19:13,801
it struck me that this ritual,
called a wedding ceremony,

265
00:19:13,962 --> 00:19:16,261
is really just the final
scene of a fairy tale,

266
00:19:16,262 --> 00:19:18,560
<i>they never tell you
what happens "after".

267
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:23,481
They never tell you that Cinderella drove the prince
crazy with her obsessive need to clean the castle.

268
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,260
That she missed her day job, right?

269
00:19:27,295 --> 00:19:31,675
No, they don't tell us what happens "after"
because there is no "after".

270
00:19:31,835 --> 00:19:36,310
The be-all and end-all
of romantic love was... Mike?

271
00:19:36,469 --> 00:19:37,699
Sex?

272
00:19:37,749 --> 00:19:41,427
<i>Mike! Mike, Mike, sex on
the brain, Mike! Right? Yes.

273
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:42,507
Marriage.

274
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:45,426
Marriage, that's right... but
it wasn't always like that.

275
00:19:45,787 --> 00:19:49,083
Around the 12th century there was
a notion known as "courtly love",

276
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:52,578
where love had nothing to do with
marriage and nothing to do with sex.

277
00:19:52,613 --> 00:19:56,807
In most cases it was defined as
a PASSIONATE relationship between

278
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:59,742
a knight and a lady of the
court who was already married,

279
00:20:00,302 --> 00:20:03,407
and so they could NEVER
consummate their love.

280
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:07,304
<i>In this way they would have
to rise above your ordinary,

281
00:20:07,305 --> 00:20:10,774
<i>you know, "going to the bathroom in
front of each other" kinda love, right?

282
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:16,530
<i>And they would go after
something more... DIVINE.

283
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:22,650
They took sex out of the equation,
and what was left was a "union of souls".

284
00:20:22,811 --> 00:20:24,361
Now, think of this...

285
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,969
<i>sex was always the fatal love potion.

286
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:29,819
Look at the literature of the time...

287
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:31,924
Lancelot and Guinevere, Tristan and Isolde.

288
00:20:31,983 --> 00:20:36,766
All consummation could lead to was
madness, despair or death.

289
00:20:37,425 --> 00:20:41,881
<i>Clinical experts, scholars and my Aunt Esther
are united in the belief that...

290
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:45,000
that true love has spiritual dimensions,

291
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:47,959
<i>while romantic love is
nothing but a lie, an illusion,

292
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:51,436
a modern myth, a soulless manipulation.

293
00:20:52,337 --> 00:20:54,754
<i>And speaking of manipulation...

294
00:20:54,913 --> 00:20:59,590
It's like going to the movies
and we see the lovers on screen kiss,

295
00:20:59,751 --> 00:21:03,351
and the music swells,
and we buy it, right?

296
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,012
So when my date takes me
home and kisses me goodnight,

297
00:21:06,013 --> 00:21:08,513
if I don't hear the Philharmonic
in my head, I dump him.

298
00:21:11,148 --> 00:21:15,145
Now, the question is,
why do we buy it?

299
00:21:15,306 --> 00:21:18,336
We buy it because, whether
it's a myth or a manipulation,

300
00:21:18,371 --> 00:21:21,251
let's face it, we all want
to fall in love, right?

301
00:21:21,741 --> 00:21:26,383
Why? Because that experience
makes us feel completely alive.

302
00:21:26,384 --> 00:21:29,312
Where every sense is heightened,
every emotion is magnified,

303
00:21:29,346 --> 00:21:33,699
our everyday reality is... is shattered,
and we are flung into the heavens.

304
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:39,216
It may only last a moment, an hour, an afternoon,
but that doesn't diminish its value.

305
00:21:39,376 --> 00:21:43,247
Because we're left with memories that we
treasure for the rest of our lives.

306
00:21:43,312 --> 00:21:46,361
I read an article a while ago... that said,

307
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:50,084
"When we fall in love, we
hear Puccini in our heads."

308
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,526
l love that.

309
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:54,454
I think it's because
his music fully expresses

310
00:21:54,582 --> 00:21:58,770
our longing FOR passion in
our lives, and romantic love.

311
00:21:58,848 --> 00:22:03,801
And while we're listening to La Bohème or Turandot,
or reading Wuthering Heights, or

312
00:22:03,963 --> 00:22:09,042
watching Casablanca,... a little
bit of that love lives in us, too.

313
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:14,598
So... the final question is:
Why do people want to fall in love,

314
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,567
when it can have such a short shelf life and
be devastatingly painful? What do you think? Stacy.

315
00:22:19,602 --> 00:22:21,384
It leads to propagation of the species?

316
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,727
- Randy.
- Psychologically we need to connect with somebody.

317
00:22:24,753 --> 00:22:25,662
- Could be.
- Jill.

318
00:22:25,697 --> 00:22:31,393
- Because we're we culturally preconditioned?
- Good answers, but much too intellectual for me.

319
00:22:31,553 --> 00:22:36,270
I think it's because...
as some of you already may know,

320
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:40,905
while it does last, it feels
fucking great, that's why.

321
00:22:42,906 --> 00:22:43,868
<i>Right?

322
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:50,341
<i>Thanks.
Thank you, thank you.

323
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:05,937
I'm halfway through my meal,
and you haven't even started yet.

324
00:23:06,097 --> 00:23:09,286
The perfect... bite.

325
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,583
You need a therapist.

326
00:23:21,685 --> 00:23:26,127
Ah, Rose, do we have to have the television on?
Can't we have a civilized conversation?

327
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:29,587
I know I'm not as intellectually stimulating
as some of your university people...

328
00:23:29,643 --> 00:23:34,151
All right, okay, I'm sorry, how was your day, Mother?

329
00:23:34,186 --> 00:23:38,680
- Who gives a shit?
- Come on! I said I was sorry, let's talk.

330
00:23:39,997 --> 00:23:43,185
I've lived too long, I should
be dead, not having conversations...

331
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:46,693
Would you stop it, please, give me that! Talk to me already!

332
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:54,032
All right. You haven't even noticed
l had my hair done differently.

333
00:23:55,793 --> 00:23:58,171
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I thought
you looked different.

334
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,358
Looks great.

335
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,537
What's different about it?

336
00:24:06,003 --> 00:24:08,032
The... um...

337
00:24:09,106 --> 00:24:14,115
There's nothing different about it. You're just like
your father, so easy to trip up.

338
00:24:18,941 --> 00:24:24,460
- So, how... how was work?
- Same as always.

339
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:29,257
Although I had one customer come in
looking for a make-over... she needed one.

340
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:33,028
Dyed blonde hair, blue eye shadow,
ash-brown foundation...

341
00:24:33,129 --> 00:24:34,953
- Hideous.
- Hideous, hideous.

342
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,483
Anyway, she was shocked when
she found out how old I was.

343
00:24:37,484 --> 00:24:39,992
Oh! How old were you?

344
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:46,372
Sorry.

345
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,037
I ran into Mr. Jenkins again.

346
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:51,302
- Oh, yeah.
- He cornered me in the elevator.

347
00:24:51,688 --> 00:24:54,626
He wants to take me to some
Alzheimer's benefit, I said forget it.

348
00:24:56,684 --> 00:24:58,980
I can't believe he still asks
you after all these years.

349
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,276
Why don't you go with him sometime?

350
00:25:01,302 --> 00:25:06,752
Oh, please! Those days are over, I raised
two daughters, I buried a husband, that's my life.

351
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,584
I have no interest in
starting another one.

352
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:11,859
Besides, he knows my situation with you.

353
00:25:14,998 --> 00:25:17,915
You're not seeing him because of me?

354
00:25:18,074 --> 00:25:21,720
How would it look? The mother's
dating and the daughter stays home alone?

355
00:25:22,444 --> 00:25:23,954
<i>Mom.

356
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,590
Who's looking?

357
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,786
Hello... Hi.

358
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:36,028
Hello, this is...

359
00:25:36,188 --> 00:25:39,542
Hello, I'm... I'm Gregory Larkin.

360
00:25:40,343 --> 00:25:43,745
Professor Gregory Larkin.

361
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,445
<i>Answer the phone, I'm sleeping.

362
00:25:53,246 --> 00:25:54,012
<i>Hello.

363
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:54,842
Hello.

364
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,835
Yes, is Professor Larkin there?

365
00:25:56,836 --> 00:25:57,364
<i>Who?

366
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,259
I mean, is Professor Morgan there?

367
00:25:59,373 --> 00:26:04,536
- Barely... who's this?
- This is Gregory Larkin.

368
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:10,692
<i>I'm a professor at the...
in the math department at Columbia.

369
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:15,121
<i>- I was just calling to see...
- What?

370
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:22,006
- How are you tonight?
- I'm fine. How you are?

371
00:26:23,405 --> 00:26:25,025
Fine.

372
00:26:32,563 --> 00:26:38,919
<i>I... I hope it wasn't presumptuous
of me, but I sat in on one of your classes and...

373
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:42,615
<i>I was very impressed with...
I hoped we could have dinner Saturday...

374
00:26:42,616 --> 00:26:43,834
Hold on!

375
00:26:45,915 --> 00:26:49,191
- Could you talk louder, please!
- I sat in on your class today.

376
00:26:49,851 --> 00:26:53,872
- Hold on a minute, hold on, don't go away.
- I was impressed with your teaching.

377
00:26:54,032 --> 00:26:58,067
<i>I was hoping that we could have dinner Saturday...

378
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:02,068
I can do this!
I can do this!

379
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:06,596
<i>Hello, can you hear me? Hello?

380
00:27:06,706 --> 00:27:11,764
Okay, let's start again... you're a math
teacher and you want to eat dinner.

381
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:13,993
I sat in on one of your classes.

382
00:27:14,128 --> 00:27:15,611
- Rose who's on the phone?
- Be quiet!

383
00:27:15,712 --> 00:27:17,756
- I'm sorry.
- No! Not you, not you.

384
00:27:17,757 --> 00:27:19,604
- Who's calling?
- I don't know!

385
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,651
Gregory Larkin.
Math department. Columbia.

386
00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:49,476
...as complex. But in
reality it is quite simple.

387
00:27:50,281 --> 00:27:55,553
It's simply a matter of pretending
that y is a function of x.

388
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:57,650
And so...

389
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:03,919
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

390
00:28:04,698 --> 00:28:08,326
- I saw you pass by.
- Yeah, I was just passing by, and...

391
00:28:09,918 --> 00:28:13,402
I'm sorry about calling
about calling the other night.

392
00:28:13,437 --> 00:28:15,627
I was so confused.

393
00:28:16,872 --> 00:28:21,192
- So, are we on for Saturday night?
- Sure.

394
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:25,830
- Good, I'm looking forward to it.
- Moi aussi.

395
00:28:32,824 --> 00:28:36,799
So, this one must be very good looking
for you to go to all this trouble.

396
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,323
Oh, I hate lipstick.

397
00:28:38,405 --> 00:28:41,327
It's not a good color for you, did
you try the samples I brought home?

398
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:44,880
- It doesn't matter, I'm not going.
- Oh, what do you want for dinner?

399
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:48,402
I don't care about dinner, I'm upset.
Can't you see that I'm upset?

400
00:28:48,422 --> 00:28:51,022
Well, how should I know, you're always
so relieved when you cancel your dates.

401
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:53,853
This is not a date, we're just
agreeing to eat at the same table.

402
00:28:54,015 --> 00:28:55,275
Then why does it matter how you look

403
00:28:55,376 --> 00:28:57,334
unless you think something
might happen with this one?

404
00:28:57,492 --> 00:28:58,742
Mother, will you stop
calling him "this one",

405
00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:00,592
it sounds like you're
picking out a lobster.

406
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:03,294
And nothing's going to happen,
he just likes the way I teach.

407
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:05,226
- You need more color.
- More color than this?

408
00:29:05,232 --> 00:29:07,467
Yes! Look, will you sit down
and let me do it.

409
00:29:07,468 --> 00:29:08,567
- All right.
- This is what I do in life.

410
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,308
Don't make me look like a clown.

411
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:11,925
No! You won't look like a clown...
here, you have to blend.

412
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:13,016
Where's the hairpiece?

413
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:16,074
Here! So do you want me to
make you something before I leave?

414
00:29:16,145 --> 00:29:17,914
Well it's not such a bad
thing to keep a man waiting,

415
00:29:17,915 --> 00:29:20,183
you don't want him to think he's
the only date you've had in years.

416
00:29:20,244 --> 00:29:20,900
He's not a date!

417
00:29:20,977 --> 00:29:22,827
- Where's the bow? Where's the bow?
- Here!

418
00:29:23,023 --> 00:29:23,862
Hi, Eddie.

419
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,901
Hey! Hey! Your mother did you up
again, looks terrific, Miss Morgan.

420
00:29:26,902 --> 00:29:27,582
Thank you.

421
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:28,491
<i>Want me to get you a cab?

422
00:29:28,492 --> 00:29:29,092
No, I'm fine.

423
00:29:29,093 --> 00:29:29,976
<i>All right.

424
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,513
Ooh, Good.

425
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:33,623
Sir!

426
00:29:41,754 --> 00:29:43,893
<i>Sorry.

427
00:29:46,555 --> 00:29:47,943
Hello!

428
00:29:50,109 --> 00:29:51,009
Are you sure about this?

429
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:53,082
- Yes, Lady, get in!
-  Now, where you gonna take me?

430
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,890
- Get in, Lady.
- Thanks.

431
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:59,254
Here's where I'm going, but don't go
'til I put up your window here.

432
00:29:59,307 --> 00:30:00,007
Oh no! No, no!

433
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:03,783
- They're broke, Lady! They're broke, Lady!
- My hair! No! My Hair!

434
00:30:03,945 --> 00:30:06,414
<i>Don't complain to me.
complain to the cab company.

435
00:30:06,415 --> 00:30:09,458
<i>- It's not my cab, Lady!
- Please, my hair... the window!

436
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:20,856
- Hi!
- Hi! Hi!

437
00:30:20,857 --> 00:30:23,209
I'm sorry, I apologize.

438
00:30:23,376 --> 00:30:25,429
I'm sorry, apologize for
what? You're exactly on time.

439
00:30:25,454 --> 00:30:29,924
Oh! No, I meant my... my hair. I must look
like l was attacked by wolves.

440
00:30:29,972 --> 00:30:34,325
Oh, well, then I apologize,
I... I didn't... I didn't even notice.

441
00:30:35,497 --> 00:30:36,678
Yeah... well...

442
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:40,016
Could you excuse me while I just go
over to the ladies' room?

443
00:30:40,017 --> 00:30:42,298
- Sure, sure.
- I'll be right back.

444
00:30:48,045 --> 00:30:51,004
<i>Do you enjoy dancing?

445
00:30:51,164 --> 00:30:54,795
<i>Yeah, I used to love to dance
with my father. You?

446
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:57,092
<i>Oh, I... I find it rather embarrassing.

447
00:30:57,127 --> 00:30:59,169
<i>- Really.
- I enjoy watching.

448
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,418
- Thank you.
- Thank you, very much.

449
00:31:03,396 --> 00:31:06,634
- Watching?
- Pairs...

450
00:31:06,793 --> 00:31:10,959
It's interesting how coupling appears
all throughout nature and in mathematics.

451
00:31:11,154 --> 00:31:13,311
Oh, yeah, you were telling
me something about pairs...

452
00:31:13,312 --> 00:31:15,469
Oh, the twin-prime conjecture.

453
00:31:15,735 --> 00:31:19,000
Yes, well, it explores
pairs of prime numbers,

454
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:22,266
numbers that are only
divisible by themselves.

455
00:31:22,428 --> 00:31:27,025
3- 5, 5-7,
Not 7-9 because...

456
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:33,147
- 9 can be divided by 3.
- That's right... that's right.

457
00:31:33,307 --> 00:31:36,230
Then you have 11-13, 17-19 and so on.

458
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:42,737
And what was discovered was what
often occurred were pairs separated by...

459
00:31:42,897 --> 00:31:44,501
One number in between.

460
00:31:45,157 --> 00:31:48,006
Exactly! Exactly!

461
00:31:49,327 --> 00:31:50,558
Did you read my book?

462
00:31:50,574 --> 00:31:52,300
No, no, I'm sorry.

463
00:31:52,313 --> 00:31:55,650
No, no, that's all right.
This... this is really marvelous.

464
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:58,567
Yeah, first date where I feel
like I'm winning on a game show.

465
00:31:58,902 --> 00:32:00,892
Oh, I... I... I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to lecture.

466
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,680
Oh, I... I... I'm sorry,
I... I didn't mean to call it a date.

467
00:32:04,968 --> 00:32:08,561
It's just rare that I meet a person
l can discuss these things with.

468
00:32:08,562 --> 00:32:11,061
Really?
It's just...

469
00:32:11,249 --> 00:32:13,716
- Some pepper?
- Oh, no, not for me.

470
00:32:13,805 --> 00:32:14,486
Thank you.

471
00:32:14,765 --> 00:32:18,146
When you get a chance, can you bring me
a little side dish of extra dressing?

472
00:32:18,147 --> 00:32:19,147
Sure.

473
00:32:20,762 --> 00:32:25,280
I don't particularly like salad,
l just like the dressing.

474
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:28,992
This twin prime
conjecture is interesting,

475
00:32:28,993 --> 00:32:31,847
what would happen if you
counted past a million?

476
00:32:31,882 --> 00:32:33,912
Would there still be pairs like that?

477
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:37,384
I can't believe you thought of that.

478
00:32:37,407 --> 00:32:41,007
This is exactly what is yet to be
proven in the twin prime conjecture.

479
00:32:41,655 --> 00:32:41,881
Really.

480
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:43,686
<i>Say, you know...

481
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:47,201
I have these tickets for
a concert next Saturday,

482
00:32:47,236 --> 00:32:49,340
I was wondering if can we do this again?

483
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:54,904
- Sure.
- Great. Terrific.

484
00:32:56,426 --> 00:33:00,403
What was it you... wanted to discuss
about my teaching?

485
00:33:00,504 --> 00:33:03,650
Oh, well, uh...

486
00:33:03,785 --> 00:33:07,655
I have a confession to make, that was
just an excuse to meet you.

487
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:11,730
- I hope you don't mind.
- Mind?

488
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:14,263
Not that I didn't find
your class fascinating.

489
00:33:14,316 --> 00:33:18,370
In fact I have so many
questions, the first of which is:

490
00:33:19,056 --> 00:33:22,011
How do you get them to stay?

491
00:33:27,903 --> 00:33:29,628
Well?

492
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:34,802
- Nothing.
- What happened to your hair?

493
00:33:35,964 --> 00:33:37,210
Don't ask.

494
00:33:39,006 --> 00:33:41,244
<i>You don't think you'll see him again?

495
00:33:41,245 --> 00:33:43,482
No, we're going out next week.

496
00:33:43,643 --> 00:33:45,821
So, he must like you.

497
00:33:49,323 --> 00:33:50,985
Did he kiss you?

498
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:54,953
No.

499
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,993
That's kind of sweet, actually.

500
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:16,832
- Hey.
- Hi.

501
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:19,426
This is Cindy.

502
00:34:26,743 --> 00:34:28,734
This is a spectrum analyzer,

503
00:34:29,118 --> 00:34:35,141
it makes graphic representations
of the music... watch.

504
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:42,537
- Who's the girl?
- Rose Morgan.

505
00:34:42,696 --> 00:34:47,492
Henry Fine, he's a professor
here in anthropology.

506
00:34:49,534 --> 00:34:51,386
<i>Beautiful music, isn't it?

507
00:34:51,387 --> 00:34:53,576
- Beautiful.
- Beautiful atmosphere.

508
00:35:11,684 --> 00:35:15,027
- Oh, God, I enjoyed that.
- Wasn't that terrific?

509
00:35:15,062 --> 00:35:17,994
- Yeah, thank you so much for inviting me.
- My pleasure, my pleasure.

510
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,545
Why don't... why don't you
come up to my apartment?

511
00:35:21,546 --> 00:35:24,531
I live just across the street, I
wanna give you a copy of my book.

512
00:35:25,198 --> 00:35:27,431
- Oh, I... I... I... I'd love that.
- Great.

513
00:35:27,537 --> 00:35:29,504
A copy of your book, I mean. I...

514
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:31,472
I didn't mean to imply I want to
come up to your apartment, right?

515
00:35:31,532 --> 00:35:35,514
- But... but Rose, I'm inviting you up.
- Oh, yeah.

516
00:35:35,674 --> 00:35:40,709
If... if... if you like this kind of music,
l have some... some wonderful CD's, but they're...

517
00:35:40,868 --> 00:35:43,455
well, they're also in my apartment.

518
00:35:44,586 --> 00:35:50,475
Greg, look, I have to be honest with you,
I... I'm a little out of practice with this.

519
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:53,641
Rose, I want you to feel comfortable,
that's very important to me.

520
00:35:53,642 --> 00:35:55,042
- It is?
- Yes, so...

521
00:35:55,084 --> 00:36:00,236
I want to tell you up front...
I'm not interested in sex.

522
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:03,903
- You're not?
- No, and it has nothing to do with you.

523
00:36:03,904 --> 00:36:04,903
- It doesn't?
- No.

524
00:36:05,179 --> 00:36:08,875
It actually has to do with what you were
talking about in your class the other day.

525
00:36:09,176 --> 00:36:10,677
- It does.
- Yes...

526
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:15,733
I, too, believe that it's illusions about
love and the emphasis on sex

527
00:36:15,894 --> 00:36:17,771
that keeps people today
separate and alone.

528
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:22,271
As... as... as... you said, yourself,
romance is a myth, a manipulation.

529
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:26,007
Oh, no, wait, I was... I was referring
to academic opinions that are purely subjective.

530
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,885
No, but Rose, Rose, you were right!

531
00:36:27,974 --> 00:36:32,015
Relationships that are based
on romantic love are worthless.

532
00:36:32,016 --> 00:36:34,180
There's no point to them,
they have no value.

533
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:36,362
Did you stay for my whole class?

534
00:36:36,525 --> 00:36:40,662
No, no, I... I left while you
were talking about the music

535
00:36:40,678 --> 00:36:42,901
that we hear when lovers kiss
in the movies, and... and...

536
00:36:43,061 --> 00:36:46,733
And I agree, it's... it's so
manipulative, because in real life,

537
00:36:46,768 --> 00:36:48,762
we don't hear music when we kiss.

538
00:36:49,078 --> 00:36:53,037
And the person you're with isn't a
movie star, it's a malicious... a malicious...

539
00:36:53,197 --> 00:36:56,323
- Fantasy?
- Fantasy, fantasy, right!

540
00:36:56,358 --> 00:36:58,014
- Do you mind if I sit down?
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

541
00:36:58,075 --> 00:37:05,073
This... this addiction to... to beauty and
perfection that's created by advertising,

542
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,642
it just feeds on people's pathetic desires.

543
00:37:07,697 --> 00:37:09,106
People, they don't...

544
00:37:09,161 --> 00:37:11,622
they don't have their own opinions
anymore, do you... do you agree?

545
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:12,068
Well, I know what you mean...

546
00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:15,227
The media tells us what's
beautiful and what's not.

547
00:37:15,388 --> 00:37:19,391
TV shows tell us what a relationship
is supposed to be like and feel like... and sex!

548
00:37:19,392 --> 00:37:20,131
Yeah?

549
00:37:20,424 --> 00:37:22,375
No, no, I don't even want to tell you
how that's ruined my life...

550
00:37:22,442 --> 00:37:23,510
Oh, no, go ahead and tell me.

551
00:37:23,601 --> 00:37:26,721
- Well, well, I... I go crazy.
- Really?

552
00:37:26,756 --> 00:37:27,670
- Literally.
- Yeah?

553
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,029
When I want someone sexually,
l go out of my mind.

554
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,055
- No kidding?
- Oh, oh, oh...

555
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:36,697
Do you remember that... that... that movie
where the woman, you know, kills the bunny?

556
00:37:36,857 --> 00:37:37,584
"Fatal Attraction"?

557
00:37:37,637 --> 00:37:39,326
Right! Right! Now,
granted, that was a film,

558
00:37:39,327 --> 00:37:41,015
- Yeah.
- But...

559
00:37:41,174 --> 00:37:42,948
I can understand what that
woman was going through.

560
00:37:42,983 --> 00:37:43,683
You can?

561
00:37:43,775 --> 00:37:46,714
- Not that I would ever kill an innocent animal.
- Oh, that's a relief.

562
00:37:46,749 --> 00:37:49,838
I'm all too familiar with that
feeling that you get when you

563
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,013
want someone so much that it
physically hurts not to have them.

564
00:37:52,014 --> 00:37:53,013
Yeah, I know... what you mean.

565
00:37:53,086 --> 00:37:56,912
This fiction, known as "falling in love",
it drives people crazy, as you said in your class.

566
00:37:56,913 --> 00:37:57,771
- I said that?
- At the end of it,

567
00:37:58,108 --> 00:38:01,613
- you're either mad, alone, or...
- I said "dead", dead.

568
00:38:01,648 --> 00:38:03,664
- Dead!
- The operative word was: fiction.

569
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:06,004
Right! Right, Rose, we're dead, dead.

570
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:12,101
Now... now I... I do believe that two people,
well, they... they CAN come together, even MARRY,

571
00:38:12,204 --> 00:38:14,014
for... for reasons that are more...

572
00:38:14,142 --> 00:38:17,358
more meaningful and more...
more concrete than sex.

573
00:38:17,393 --> 00:38:23,594
A love that grows in time out of respect,
love, trust, common interest.

574
00:38:23,755 --> 00:38:26,397
You ever notice how those friendships
last longer than most marriages?

575
00:38:26,398 --> 00:38:28,797
- Well, that's true...
- ...in this day and age...

576
00:38:28,872 --> 00:38:31,003
But I think the 12th
century was on to something.

577
00:38:31,113 --> 00:38:34,552
- Yeah?
- Would you like some coffee? Tea?

578
00:38:36,308 --> 00:38:38,571
Got any scotch?

579
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:41,510
<i>Yes. Yes.

580
00:38:41,668 --> 00:38:47,194
<i>So, are you busy during the week? I was hoping
you could help me with my teaching.

581
00:38:47,229 --> 00:38:49,812
<i>I'm sure you're much better
than you give yourself credit for.

582
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:53,701
<i>Hey, maybe you could sit in on one
of my classes, tell me what you think.

583
00:38:53,863 --> 00:38:58,338
If X squared plus Y squared
equals 16,

584
00:38:58,498 --> 00:39:01,782
<i>how do we find DV/DX
as an implicit function of X and Y?

585
00:39:01,978 --> 00:39:05,916
<i>Well, Y is a function of X,
so we could differentiate both sides.

586
00:39:06,117 --> 00:39:10,445
<i>The right hand side is...
...what is the left hand side?

587
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:15,145
<i>...and you're like walking
across the room like this,

588
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:18,687
<i>and you're into your
own thing, it's like...

589
00:39:18,848 --> 00:39:21,807
Your body language is very detached,
very alienating.

590
00:39:21,967 --> 00:39:24,156
I mean... you see what I'm saying?

591
00:39:24,325 --> 00:39:29,806
I... I... I just think that you have to
relate more to the kids... engage them.

592
00:39:29,966 --> 00:39:32,244
You're up there with
your back to the room,

593
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,522
having a great time
solving your own problems, but...

594
00:39:34,682 --> 00:39:37,661
It's like you're having a math
party, and you only invited yourself.

595
00:39:38,262 --> 00:39:39,955
- No math party?
- No math party.

596
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:43,510
So, relax, loosen up,
have some fun with it.

597
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:46,663
Relax, have fun... what was
the other thing you said?

598
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:51,469
"Loosen up". Greg, put the pen down,
I'm not going to test you on this stuff.

599
00:39:51,736 --> 00:39:54,197
Come on, teach me something, anything.

600
00:39:54,198 --> 00:39:55,559
- Okay!
- Um-huh.

601
00:39:56,992 --> 00:40:03,965
If a... if a ball is thrown into the air,
and its height, H, equals 100 T...

602
00:40:04,009 --> 00:40:08,425
Gregory, you fink, what are you doing?
No, turn around, turn around, talk to me.

603
00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:10,743
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

604
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:15,380
T is time in seconds, at what limit is
the speed approaching when T approaches...

605
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:17,898
You lost me, I'm absolutely...
What does that all mean?

606
00:40:17,899 --> 00:40:20,383
You have to put it in some
context, make up a story,

607
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:22,797
Jazz it up a little, maybe
find some humor in it.

608
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:25,051
Humor in calculus?

609
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,744
Well, try telling a story.

610
00:40:27,779 --> 00:40:29,376
- A story?
- All right.

611
00:40:31,297 --> 00:40:35,265
Oh, okay...once upon a time...

612
00:40:35,292 --> 00:40:40,133
- Um-huh.
- there was a... a ball,

613
00:40:41,454 --> 00:40:44,929
and it was thrown into the air,

614
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:53,806
and its height...
Maybe I should just write books.

615
00:40:53,966 --> 00:40:58,283
Why, no one understands those either?
Just kidding.

616
00:40:58,643 --> 00:41:01,645
Don't give up, don't give
up, do it again, try it again.

617
00:41:01,664 --> 00:41:03,684
- Tell you another story?
- Right, another story.

618
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,399
- Hi, Professor Larkin, Oh-oh, I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, no, no, no...

619
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:11,677
<i>That's all right.

620
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:13,923
Do we have an appointment?

621
00:41:14,118 --> 00:41:17,792
No, actually, I wanted to make one,
it's about next semester.

622
00:41:21,672 --> 00:41:25,573
Tomorrow... could you come
back tomorrow, after class?

623
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,454
My head is swimming,
it's hot in here.

624
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:35,859
Why don't you put your
head between your legs.

625
00:41:36,331 --> 00:41:37,831
That's a good idea.

626
00:41:40,622 --> 00:41:42,517
Pretty girl.

627
00:41:42,571 --> 00:41:43,849
<i>Very pretty.

628
00:41:43,904 --> 00:41:45,690
How can you tell
under all that make-up?

629
00:41:45,825 --> 00:41:47,248
<i>You don't use make-up, do you?

630
00:41:47,778 --> 00:41:51,002
What's the point, I still look like me,
only in color.

631
00:41:51,061 --> 00:41:53,959
<i>No, you're just too smart for
all that, you know who you are,

632
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,857
<i>you're a confident, no-nonsense,
no frills kind of woman.

633
00:41:57,018 --> 00:41:59,197
I sound like an airline.

634
00:41:59,198 --> 00:42:01,376
<i>I'm sorry, I'm probably saying it wrong.

635
00:42:01,537 --> 00:42:04,481
It's just that you
don't need any of that, Rose.

636
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:10,966
Thanks.
How's your head?

637
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,979
Yeah, I think, ya
know, food will help you.

638
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,008
- Pizza, maybe?
- Yeah! Yeah, that'd be great!

639
00:42:19,009 --> 00:42:20,434
<i>Thank you for helping me.

640
00:42:21,267 --> 00:42:25,092
<i>Where can we go? Someplace really interesting.
Dancing? Now, why did I say that?

641
00:42:25,165 --> 00:42:26,979
<i>Oh! You can take me to my
great dessert place.

642
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,592
<i>Sure!

643
00:42:27,864 --> 00:42:29,621
<i>why is everything that's
delicious, fattening.

644
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:32,939
Oh, my mother would kill me, but I'd love to...
What is that, a Danish? I mean...

645
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,878
This is the one, right here!

646
00:42:38,037 --> 00:42:42,385
Trees, they're so fascinating, they don't
even have to touch to propagate.

647
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:46,034
Greg, you would find that fascinating...

648
00:42:46,194 --> 00:42:50,234
- How many do I need?
- You need a 2... 1,2,3,4,5,6...

649
00:42:50,595 --> 00:42:52,272
Why didn't I see this move?

650
00:42:54,109 --> 00:42:55,746
Thank you very much, I owe you one.

651
00:42:55,752 --> 00:42:58,991
Sometimes you don't see what's
right in front of your face.

652
00:43:03,828 --> 00:43:08,144
Six and a five... gotcha, gotcha!

653
00:43:08,306 --> 00:43:09,579
Oh! The pretzel!

654
00:43:10,646 --> 00:43:14,139
Oh, you can have mine, you sounded so
excited over the phone, what was it?

655
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,089
Well, I'm not ready to write,
but let me run this by you...

656
00:43:16,092 --> 00:43:18,236
<i>I'm going to take my
idea about falling in love

657
00:43:18,237 --> 00:43:20,381
<i>as a societal, man-made,
cultural creation

658
00:43:20,536 --> 00:43:23,467
and expand that to include
a biological participation

659
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:25,598
and its effect on the individual man...

660
00:43:25,659 --> 00:43:27,650
- Do you see?
- You need a hobby.

661
00:43:28,061 --> 00:43:30,629
- You're gonna get it now, Kid.
- Oh, yeah?

662
00:43:33,534 --> 00:43:36,739
<i>God! I can't believe you've been dating
for three months and haven't even kissed!

663
00:43:36,774 --> 00:43:38,452
I can't figure-out the logistics of that.

664
00:43:38,612 --> 00:43:43,369
- How do you say "hello"?
- Well, we nod... it works... kind of.

665
00:43:43,529 --> 00:43:46,146
Are you telling me you
haven't even touched?

666
00:43:46,147 --> 00:43:48,764
Oh, I fell down once and he
picked me up, does that count?

667
00:43:49,485 --> 00:43:51,006
We talk a lot, that's what we do.

668
00:43:51,007 --> 00:43:54,206
- About what?
- Oh, about everything, it's great because I...

669
00:43:54,282 --> 00:43:56,961
I don't worry about what I say,
what I wear, what I eat.

670
00:43:57,122 --> 00:43:58,906
It's such a relief
eating in front of a man

671
00:43:58,982 --> 00:44:01,128
and not worrying whether he's
going to get frightened or not.

672
00:44:01,129 --> 00:44:02,129
I like that!

673
00:44:02,401 --> 00:44:04,297
- He's really fun to be with, too.
- Yeah?

674
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,805
Well, maybe "fun" is too cheerful a word...
he's "interesting"... that's what he is.

675
00:44:07,806 --> 00:44:08,206
Interesting.

676
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:10,067
- How many men can you say that about?
- Not many.

677
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:13,042
Do you think a TIE is too
personal a birthday gift?

678
00:44:13,137 --> 00:44:16,997
Not unless you're planning to use it
on something else, other than his neck.

679
00:44:17,156 --> 00:44:19,849
- Does he look good in vests?
- He'd look good in a garbage bag.

680
00:44:19,884 --> 00:44:23,215
- Why do you want him to meet your mother?
- I don't, it was my big mouth.

681
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,347
Ya know, I kept telling
him what a great cook I was,

682
00:44:25,419 --> 00:44:27,787
the next thing I know I'm
offering a birthday dinner.

683
00:44:27,847 --> 00:44:29,357
And I've got to find him something nice,

684
00:44:29,457 --> 00:44:31,465
'cause after he meets her, I'll
probably never see him again.

685
00:44:31,567 --> 00:44:33,322
<i>Hi, Girls! Rose!

686
00:44:33,323 --> 00:44:35,122
- Hi!
- Hi, Claire!

687
00:44:35,245 --> 00:44:36,967
I'm starving, can we eat?

688
00:44:36,968 --> 00:44:37,768
- Hi!
- Yeah!

689
00:44:37,861 --> 00:44:41,476
Oh, Honey, I hate to turn down a
meal, but I got a date with a post grad.

690
00:44:41,626 --> 00:44:43,954
Claire, help her find a
gift for Dr. Strangelove.

691
00:44:44,303 --> 00:44:45,940
- Who?
- ???

692
00:44:45,941 --> 00:44:47,378
Ya know, we should get you some blush.

693
00:44:47,857 --> 00:44:49,666
- No!
- I'm hungry, Claire.

694
00:44:49,758 --> 00:44:51,192
- Fruit.
- Fruit?

695
00:44:51,219 --> 00:44:52,100
Yes! Fruit!

696
00:44:52,201 --> 00:44:54,381
Why are you so grumpy today,
how's everything going?

697
00:44:54,382 --> 00:44:55,338
Oh, please!

698
00:44:55,373 --> 00:44:59,053
Ay, Claire, if he wasn't gorgeous, rich and
straight, I wouldn't have even bothered.

699
00:44:59,138 --> 00:45:00,419
- What's wrong?
- Nothing!

700
00:45:00,454 --> 00:45:04,331
I'm just sick to death of the sight of the man
l am bound to for eternity., that's all.

701
00:45:04,491 --> 00:45:07,573
- Why are you saying that?
- What am I saying that? Two soups please.

702
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:11,569
Because! No matter where I go,
no matter what I do, there he is.

703
00:45:11,727 --> 00:45:14,529
In the kitchen, in the bathroom,
on the phone, on my finger.

704
00:45:14,688 --> 00:45:18,130
I was asleep the other night.
When I wake up, he's staring at me.

705
00:45:18,131 --> 00:45:19,330
- Staring at you?
- Yeah.

706
00:45:19,385 --> 00:45:22,480
- I think that's sweet.
- Sweet? I think it's kinda strange.

707
00:45:22,481 --> 00:45:24,481
Eh! Hey! We're done! Let's go!

708
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:27,963
I mean, do you have any idea
how weird that makes me feel?

709
00:45:28,123 --> 00:45:30,407
I'm in the middle of one of my
lesbian orgies dreams, and

710
00:45:30,408 --> 00:45:32,692
he's staring at me like
I'm supposed to include HIM.

711
00:45:32,818 --> 00:45:34,630
I can't even fantasize in private.

712
00:45:34,668 --> 00:45:36,317
<i>Here's your change, Hon.

713
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:37,318
Thank you.

714
00:45:38,785 --> 00:45:39,849
One soup.

715
00:45:41,234 --> 00:45:44,698
So, Mom said you've been
seeing somebody pretty steady.

716
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:46,962
- She did?
- Is he cute?

717
00:45:47,762 --> 00:45:50,073
- Aw, shit!
- What?

718
00:45:50,074 --> 00:45:52,567
- Hi, Girls.
- Oh, hi, Alex.

719
00:45:52,602 --> 00:45:54,627
- Rose.
- What are you doing here?

720
00:45:54,787 --> 00:45:57,972
Well, I... I thought
I'd meet you for coffee.

721
00:45:58,747 --> 00:46:00,347
Is that a terrible thing to do?

722
00:46:01,866 --> 00:46:06,422
Excuse me, I'm going
to the ladies' room... alone.

723
00:46:11,223 --> 00:46:16,246
Can you believe this weather?
It's almost April and it's still cold.

724
00:46:18,141 --> 00:46:21,800
I'm glad I have you alone, actually.
Can I ask you a question?

725
00:46:22,116 --> 00:46:24,229
It may sound strange, but...

726
00:46:26,293 --> 00:46:31,126
Is Claire happy?
I mean, do YOU think she's happy?

727
00:46:33,581 --> 00:46:37,726
Yes, I... I... I... I think she is.. why?

728
00:46:37,789 --> 00:46:41,080
I'm being silly.
I'm a first-time husband, I guess.

729
00:46:41,546 --> 00:46:46,977
If she doesn't wake up every morning
telling me how ecstatic she is, I... I worry.

730
00:46:49,962 --> 00:46:53,918
Did you ever think that when you and I first met
I'd end up marrying your sister?

731
00:46:54,547 --> 00:46:56,753
And I have you to thank for it.

732
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:59,240
YOU made this possible.

733
00:47:00,876 --> 00:47:03,833
Knowing you has changed my life, Rose.

734
00:47:04,275 --> 00:47:09,551
- Don't... don't do that.
- What? What am I doing?

735
00:47:11,755 --> 00:47:14,311
You don't even know, do you?

736
00:47:17,987 --> 00:47:19,951
Oh, Rose.

737
00:47:20,011 --> 00:47:24,539
- Just tell Claire that I had to run, okay?
- Rose, Rose, I'm sorry.

738
00:47:29,809 --> 00:47:36,223
Wow! I really thought I was over him.
I hate this, it's so stupid, I...

739
00:47:36,383 --> 00:47:39,179
- and I sound so pathetic.
- No, no, not at all.

740
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:43,647
He asked if Claire was happy,
and I... I lied.

741
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:47,201
- Isn't that awful?
- Nothing criminal.

742
00:47:49,425 --> 00:47:51,557
Thank you for seeing
me on such short notice.

743
00:47:51,581 --> 00:47:54,536
You... you sounded so upset over the phone,
are you feeling any better now?

744
00:47:54,554 --> 00:47:56,925
Yeah, yeah, a little.

745
00:47:57,033 --> 00:48:00,810
- You know, Rose, it takes time.
- Yeah, I know.

746
00:48:01,471 --> 00:48:07,183
Greg, I want you to know that I...
I really value our friendship...

747
00:48:08,105 --> 00:48:09,748
it means a lot to me.

748
00:48:09,968 --> 00:48:14,037
- I feel the same way, which is why tonight...
- Tonight?!

749
00:48:14,072 --> 00:48:18,524
Well, I... I better go home, because I have to get
dinner ready. I'll see you at eight, okay?

750
00:48:18,983 --> 00:48:21,856
Shall I bring anything?
Something for your mother?

751
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:25,655
Yeah, a wooden stake and a crucifix.

752
00:48:26,056 --> 00:48:27,256
Bye.

753
00:48:29,876 --> 00:48:34,417
<i>Rose loves to fold napkins...
one of her idiosyncrasies.

754
00:48:36,033 --> 00:48:42,486
You'll have to forgive me, I came home late from work
and just threw this on. God knows how I look.

755
00:48:48,472 --> 00:48:49,572
I hope you like it.

756
00:48:50,207 --> 00:48:53,451
<i>God, Rose, it's art!

757
00:48:53,486 --> 00:48:55,990
- Oh, no, It's not art.
- No, no, no.

758
00:48:56,025 --> 00:49:01,144
An artist isn't just somebody who paints or sculpts,
it's somebody who sets the table a certain way,

759
00:49:01,306 --> 00:49:03,977
prepares a meal a certain way,
or teaches in a certain way.

760
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,858
- You're an artist, isn't she?
- Thank you.

761
00:49:07,501 --> 00:49:10,847
Why didn't you use the Limoges, Dear?
We have company.

762
00:49:11,418 --> 00:49:13,121
May I serve you?

763
00:49:15,097 --> 00:49:17,335
- Rose!
- Oh, my hands are clean.

764
00:49:17,696 --> 00:49:21,957
We go to all this trouble,
and Rose and I don't eat very much.

765
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:23,106
Really? Oh!

766
00:49:23,815 --> 00:49:27,229
Whenever I've been with Rose, I've noticed
she had a very HEALTHY appetite.

767
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:31,056
I can't stand women who eat
two bites and say they're full.

768
00:49:31,071 --> 00:49:32,570
Thank God.

769
00:49:35,367 --> 00:49:38,535
Rose, do you really
need extra salt, Dear?

770
00:49:38,536 --> 00:49:41,702
You know how much water a woman
retains with too much salt.

771
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,770
- Can I have some?
- There you go.

772
00:49:44,824 --> 00:49:48,003
<i>- And I love the potatoes, too.
- Uh-uh, you don't need them.

773
00:49:49,001 --> 00:49:51,246
<i>Have you ever sat IN
on one of your daughter's classes?

774
00:49:51,247 --> 00:49:54,028
<i>Oh, my mother sitting-in on
one of my classes? Right!

775
00:49:54,118 --> 00:49:54,518
<i>Rose!

776
00:49:54,519 --> 00:49:55,519
What?

777
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,520
Oh, that's... that's the best part.

778
00:50:04,715 --> 00:50:07,041
Rose tells me you've never been married.

779
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:08,966
Mom!

780
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:10,881
<i>That's all right, Rose.

781
00:50:12,287 --> 00:50:15,829
That's correct, Mrs. Morgan, l... I haven't.

782
00:50:15,864 --> 00:50:19,100
I guess it's the old saying that I
just haven't found the right girl.

783
00:50:19,628 --> 00:50:24,532
I have had several relationships that haven't
worked out, but, that... that's all going to change.

784
00:50:24,567 --> 00:50:26,333
Oh, really? Why?

785
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:33,902
Well, as I... as I told Rose,
l have a theory about love, and

786
00:50:34,062 --> 00:50:36,612
- sex.
- Does anybody want coffee?

787
00:50:36,613 --> 00:50:38,280
Oh, I'd love some.

788
00:50:38,315 --> 00:50:41,429
- What theory?
- Regular or decaf?

789
00:50:42,538 --> 00:50:46,510
- Regular.
- I can make cappuccinos.

790
00:50:47,476 --> 00:50:50,443
Cappuccinos, would you like
cappuccinos? How about that? Huh?

791
00:50:50,504 --> 00:50:52,412
Greg, why don't you come
to the kitchen and help me.

792
00:50:52,473 --> 00:50:54,971
Rose, why don't you
go put the coffee on?

793
00:50:54,972 --> 00:50:57,871
Mother, I made dinner, why
don't you put the coffee on?

794
00:50:57,906 --> 00:51:01,352
I raised two daughters, I buried
a husband, I've made my coffee.

795
00:51:10,366 --> 00:51:12,590
Well! Alone at last.

796
00:51:14,717 --> 00:51:17,645
- I've heard a lot about you.
- And I've heard a lot about you.

797
00:51:18,092 --> 00:51:19,604
Oh.

798
00:51:20,799 --> 00:51:23,526
You've been seeing a lot
of my daughter these last few months, and...

799
00:51:24,186 --> 00:51:29,597
I hope you don't mind my asking, but...
I'd like to know what your intentions are.

800
00:51:32,016 --> 00:51:33,766
My intentions?

801
00:51:35,542 --> 00:51:37,339
Well...

802
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:41,947
What a lovely meal!
Ah, gosh, you're a good cook.

803
00:51:41,948 --> 00:51:44,204
Oh, thank you, thank you.
I didn't oversell myself?

804
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:47,466
No, no, on the contrary, but you didn't
have to go to all that trouble.

805
00:51:47,626 --> 00:51:50,816
Of course I had to go to
all that trouble, it was your birthday.

806
00:51:51,986 --> 00:51:57,964
Ya know, what are friends for, but to give
each other presents and stuff, and...

807
00:51:58,423 --> 00:52:00,120
Happy birthday.

808
00:52:00,903 --> 00:52:02,160
Rose!

809
00:52:02,361 --> 00:52:04,606
Open it up, open up, open up, open up.

810
00:52:04,697 --> 00:52:07,802
- You shouldn't have done this.
- I know, I know, I know, I really hope you like it.

811
00:52:09,695 --> 00:52:10,925
What are these, dice?

812
00:52:11,155 --> 00:52:15,191
They once were dice, now
they're cuff links with...

813
00:52:15,526 --> 00:52:18,754
- Prime numbers!
- Two, three, five, no nine.

814
00:52:18,813 --> 00:52:24,201
- They are so beautiful! How did you do that?
- Had 'em made... especially for you.

815
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:27,100
Hope they're okay,
they were done very fast.

816
00:52:27,101 --> 00:52:29,651
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

817
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:36,144
Yeah, well...

818
00:52:37,442 --> 00:52:43,100
Rose, I've been meaning to ask you something,
and I can only say this once...

819
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:46,281
- What?
- Sit down.

820
00:52:47,959 --> 00:52:53,916
I think we have a lot in common and, although I'm aware
that certain variables are, and forever will be, unknown,

821
00:52:53,976 --> 00:52:56,467
as is the case with most
complex equations where you'd have

822
00:52:56,538 --> 00:52:58,956
- two complete, reverse...
- Greg, talk to me.

823
00:53:00,948 --> 00:53:02,883
I'm not saying this right, am I?

824
00:53:03,332 --> 00:53:04,261
What?

825
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:12,750
Well, this... this feeling you have for Alex,
well, it won't be the same with ME.

826
00:53:12,906 --> 00:53:19,855
You won't have that constant ache in the pit of
your stomach, because... well, we're not in love.

827
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:24,462
I think we DO share
a genuine AFFECTION for each other.

828
00:53:24,623 --> 00:53:28,819
We share a passion for knowledge,
rather than the physical passion.

829
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:35,015
Although, if sex is something
that interests you,

830
00:53:35,175 --> 00:53:40,376
I'm sure I could provide that on
occasion, given enough warning.

831
00:53:40,937 --> 00:53:42,680
What are you saying?

832
00:53:42,776 --> 00:53:46,570
Well, we were both in love and we were
both miserable, and we're both alone.

833
00:53:46,605 --> 00:53:49,648
Which is a waste, really,
because as people, we're quite valuable.

834
00:53:50,049 --> 00:53:51,474
Yeah?

835
00:53:51,509 --> 00:53:58,207
Rose, when I look at you, I see a woman
unlike any other I've known before.

836
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:02,504
Your mind, your humor,
your passion for ideas.

837
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:04,524
I'm very fond of you.

838
00:54:05,185 --> 00:54:09,125
I feel, in a strange way,
when I'm with you, I feel as if I'm...

839
00:54:10,361 --> 00:54:13,120
as if... as if I'm home.

840
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,582
- So I think we should get married.
- Huh?

841
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:22,177
People marry for sexual passion,
which fades, or beauty, which fades.

842
00:54:22,278 --> 00:54:24,599
Why are my reasons
more insane than those?

843
00:54:26,794 --> 00:54:29,376
Are you in shock, or just appalled?

844
00:54:30,471 --> 00:54:32,424
Blink if you can hear me.

845
00:54:35,993 --> 00:54:39,650
- What? Why are you laughing?
- I just... I'm sorry... I... what...

846
00:54:39,671 --> 00:54:44,224
This sounds silly,
but... but... I was just thinking...

847
00:54:45,066 --> 00:54:50,704
How... how can... how can I marry someone
that... that I've never even...

848
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,639
you know...

849
00:54:56,485 --> 00:54:57,878
Oh.

850
00:55:05,658 --> 00:55:07,215
kissed.

851
00:55:08,814 --> 00:55:12,672
Ya know, before you answer, there is
one other thing I have to tell you,

852
00:55:12,673 --> 00:55:15,931
I promised your sister I wouldn't, but I
can't enter into this without you knowing.

853
00:55:16,091 --> 00:55:19,641
- You love Claire, too?
- No! No... I... I...

854
00:55:19,676 --> 00:55:21,815
- You just slept with her?
- Oh, God! No!

855
00:55:21,828 --> 00:55:24,124
- You want to sleep with her?
- Rose! I don't even know your sister!

856
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:26,749
- Oh!
- No! No... it's about how I found you,

857
00:55:26,818 --> 00:55:29,999
- you see, I wrote this ad...
- An ad?

858
00:55:30,085 --> 00:55:32,090
- Yes.
- l think that's kind of great.

859
00:55:32,391 --> 00:55:33,754
- Oh, you do?
- Uh-huh!

860
00:55:34,006 --> 00:55:36,442
Oh, what a relief! Oh, I thought
you were going to be upset.

861
00:55:36,477 --> 00:55:37,920
Why? You picked ME.

862
00:55:38,081 --> 00:55:41,225
Well, actually, I found
you through this ad,

863
00:55:41,226 --> 00:55:44,371
<i>and there was this
charming woman on TV...

864
00:55:45,097 --> 00:55:48,781
<i>Alicia, I think her name was, I think...

865
00:55:58,511 --> 00:56:00,529
Well, well, well...

866
00:56:04,766 --> 00:56:06,275
<I>So?

867
00:56:08,229 --> 00:56:11,005
Gregory just proposed to me.

868
00:56:12,564 --> 00:56:14,274
Do you need a valium?

869
00:56:15,206 --> 00:56:20,081
Well, I know you don't have much respect
for my opinion, but I don't trust him.

870
00:56:20,142 --> 00:56:25,252
- I mean, where's the attraction?
- You mean: why is he attracted to ME?

871
00:56:25,253 --> 00:56:27,562
He's not mother, does that
make you feel better?

872
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:30,379
He doesn't want SEX,
he wants to be companions.

873
00:56:30,564 --> 00:56:32,202
Companions!

874
00:56:32,778 --> 00:56:35,296
<i>What sane person would
agree to that kind of marriage?

875
00:56:35,297 --> 00:56:38,351
I never HEARD of anything
so ridiculous, it's not natural.

876
00:56:38,386 --> 00:56:40,085
What's natural? Claire and Alex?

877
00:56:40,219 --> 00:56:43,451
He WANTS me, Mother! Maybe not the
same way you and CLAIRE were wanted.

878
00:56:43,512 --> 00:56:46,807
Sure he wants you!
He wants you to cook and clean for him!

879
00:56:46,813 --> 00:56:48,812
Then it would be much different than living here!

880
00:56:48,932 --> 00:56:52,248
I happen to know he found you
through an Ad! Your sister told me.

881
00:56:52,683 --> 00:56:55,010
I already know, Mom, sorry.

882
00:56:57,024 --> 00:57:03,042
Look... I know this isn't your
average proposal, but... let's face it...

883
00:57:03,201 --> 00:57:05,274
ya know, they're not
standing in line for me.

884
00:57:05,661 --> 00:57:08,914
And besides, we... we have a lot in
common, we really like each other!

885
00:57:09,078 --> 00:57:12,918
Then say yes! What do you want from me?!
I can live alone! I can manage!

886
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:17,180
If you think getting married under
these conditions is normal, then go ahead.

887
00:57:19,896 --> 00:57:21,409
Why do you do that?

888
00:57:22,964 --> 00:57:26,568
Why do you make it sound so... pathetic?

889
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:30,910
You had a life.
A husband who adored you.

890
00:57:30,992 --> 00:57:34,789
Why don't you want me to have
just a little bit of that?

891
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:41,145
I'm getting older, too, Mom.
Why can't you be happy for me?

892
00:57:41,306 --> 00:57:43,376
But you can't, can you?

893
00:57:45,321 --> 00:57:48,162
Because you're scared
to death of being alone.

894
00:57:48,197 --> 00:57:50,781
- And you're jealous.
- Jealous? Huh!

895
00:57:50,942 --> 00:57:57,859
Jealous because a man wants me.
A GOOD looking man wants me, how ridiculous!

896
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:03,048
Well, you know something, Mom?
A man does.

897
00:58:20,046 --> 00:58:25,725
Today, Gregory Thomas Larkin and Rose Rachel Morgan
have placed rings on each other's fingers,

898
00:58:25,885 --> 00:58:29,722
and have agreed to share their lives and hopes,
and to recognize each other as equals.

899
00:58:29,844 --> 00:58:34,120
They shall seek, through kindness and understanding,
to achieve a life together as they have envisioned.

900
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,407
We are gathered here to participate and
witness this special ceremony of marriage,

901
00:58:37,408 --> 00:58:40,534
which is a means of establishing
and continuing a home.

902
00:58:40,569 --> 00:58:44,596
Inasmuch as you have considered together to live
in wedlock and to exchange vows before witnesses,

903
00:58:44,757 --> 00:58:47,484
by the authority vested in me, and in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York,

904
00:58:47,485 --> 00:58:50,657
l now pronounce you husband and wife.
Here's your certificate and good luck.

905
00:58:50,658 --> 00:58:52,719
Thank you very much, Your Honor.

906
00:58:53,766 --> 00:58:57,346
- Congratulations! She's a great...
- Yes, she is, thanks.

907
00:58:58,053 --> 00:59:01,112
- I've heard so much...
- Likewise about you, you're pretty...

908
00:59:01,147 --> 00:59:02,012
We all ought to...

909
00:59:02,048 --> 00:59:04,558
Oh, absolutely, that would be wonderful,
excuse me, got to make a phone call.

910
00:59:05,107 --> 00:59:06,598
Congratulations!

911
00:59:06,607 --> 00:59:09,306
Had I known you were this good looking,
I'd've answered the ad for myself.

912
00:59:09,467 --> 00:59:16,041
Oh, Congratulations! She's the best person I know.
I mean, if l were a man, I'd be all over her.

913
00:59:17,299 --> 00:59:23,892
Good luck and congratulations, I'm sure you'll
both be very fascinating to watch.

914
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,496
<i>Marriage is the supreme sharing
of experience and an adventure...

915
00:59:31,952 --> 00:59:32,709
<i>Rose.

916
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:33,467
Yeah.

917
00:59:33,494 --> 00:59:36,535
<i>Isn't it amazing how many books
you accumulate over the years?

918
00:59:36,893 --> 00:59:39,685
<i>- Yeah, I know what you mean.
- Oh! I can't believe it.

919
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:41,535
<i>And the dust!

920
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:46,236
<i>- Ya know, this place needs a good cleaning.
- Well, we'll take care of that.

921
00:59:49,407 --> 00:59:52,346
- I made some room on the shelves for your books.
- Oh, good.

922
00:59:52,465 --> 00:59:57,886
- Need any help?
- No, everything's pretty much... put in its place.

923
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:07,487
- So, what would you like to do?
- Go to bed.

924
01:00:08,477 --> 01:00:14,664
To sleep... I mean... to, to... in order to sleep.
You go to the bed for sleeping.

925
01:00:17,554 --> 01:00:19,085
- Unless you'd rather do something else?
- I'm sorry, what?

926
01:00:19,173 --> 01:00:21,256
- What?
- No, no, go... go ahead.

927
01:00:21,431 --> 01:00:23,078
I wasn't going to say anything.

928
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:26,932
All right, all right, so,
do you want the bathroom first?

929
01:00:27,111 --> 01:00:28,011
No, I can wait.

930
01:00:28,012 --> 01:00:30,540
<i>No, no, no, no, you go.

931
01:00:30,575 --> 01:00:33,621
- Are... are you sure?
- No, no, you go... please... please.

932
01:00:48,315 --> 01:00:49,779
Oh, God.

933
01:01:02,257 --> 01:01:03,769
Your turn.

934
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:38,397
<i>Tired?

935
01:01:38,398 --> 01:01:39,756
Not really.

936
01:01:40,115 --> 01:01:44,544
- Me neither. These are nice.
- Thanks.

937
01:01:46,741 --> 01:01:50,695
- Do you want to watch some TV?
- Oh, sure, I have some tapes... old movies.

938
01:01:50,714 --> 01:01:52,925
- Oh, great.
- Oh, good.

939
01:01:54,746 --> 01:01:56,421
<i>I brought, let's see...

940
01:01:56,428 --> 01:02:00,636
"It Happened One Night", "Lawrence
of Arabia", "Now, Voyager"?

941
01:02:00,667 --> 01:02:03,437
How about "Lawrence of Arabia"?
It's nice and long.

942
01:02:06,087 --> 01:02:11,921
Okay, "Lawrence of Arabia" it is.

943
01:02:12,022 --> 01:02:15,868
- Just stick it in.
- Right.

944
01:02:44,444 --> 01:02:48,456
- Is it over?
- Yeah. Now, go to sleep.

945
01:03:05,716 --> 01:03:07,646
<i>Are you just looking, or buying?

946
01:03:08,975 --> 01:03:11,405
It all depends, I'm not sure yet.

947
01:03:11,606 --> 01:03:15,007
- So, how about you? It seems to be going well.
- Better than that.

948
01:03:15,034 --> 01:03:18,593
- Have you two...?
- No, and it hasn't made a bit of difference.

949
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:22,454
I don't know how you do it, but if it
works I give you both a lot of credit.

950
01:03:22,489 --> 01:03:24,457
Credit? Credit for what?

951
01:03:24,508 --> 01:03:27,371
Oh, I was just telling Henry
how sex isn't an issue for us.

952
01:03:29,467 --> 01:03:33,751
I mean, it's much less complicated
this way, not to mention sanitary.

953
01:04:14,247 --> 01:04:18,722
Yes, yes... it feels so
good to be writing again,

954
01:04:18,757 --> 01:04:21,600
- I'm having so many ideas for the new book.
- Yeah?

955
01:04:21,683 --> 01:04:25,085
I can't believe how easily it's coming,
I have outlines for three chapters already.

956
01:04:25,286 --> 01:04:26,286
That's great.

957
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,357
What a terrific idea this was of
yours, Rose, to come here to the Park.

958
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:32,156
I... I've never written in
the park, it's wonderful.

959
01:04:32,257 --> 01:04:32,917
<i>I'm glad.

960
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:35,796
Another one of these.

961
01:04:35,956 --> 01:04:37,581
Is that Barry?

962
01:04:38,336 --> 01:04:40,336
<i>I think it is.

963
01:04:41,633 --> 01:04:42,791
Barry.

964
01:04:43,574 --> 01:04:44,803
Barry.

965
01:04:45,269 --> 01:04:46,200
Hi, it's Rose.

966
01:04:46,201 --> 01:04:47,131
<i>Rose.

967
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:49,226
- Hi, how are you?
- How are you?

968
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:50,633
- Good to see ya.
- This is Gloria.

969
01:04:50,634 --> 01:04:51,433
- Hello.
- Hello.

970
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:54,804
- Oh! This is my husband, Gregory Larkin.
- Hello.

971
01:04:54,839 --> 01:04:56,545
<i>Hi, Gregory, yes, this is Gloria.

972
01:04:56,706 --> 01:05:00,082
- I heard you got married, congratulations.
- Thank you.

973
01:05:01,102 --> 01:05:02,476
Gosh, you look good, Barry.

974
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:06,876
- Well, being engaged agrees with me.
- Engaged! Oh, congratulations!

975
01:05:06,879 --> 01:05:09,005
Yeah, well, I finally found
someone who didn't cancel on me.

976
01:05:09,006 --> 01:05:10,932
Will you excuse me,
please, nice to meet you.

977
01:05:11,133 --> 01:05:13,020
It's nice to meet you, too, thanks.

978
01:05:17,177 --> 01:05:20,997
- I'm really happy for you... both.
- Thank you.

979
01:05:21,063 --> 01:05:25,061
- Thank you, Rose, and take care.
- You, too.

980
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,676
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's okay.

981
01:06:03,696 --> 01:06:04,933
What?

982
01:06:05,953 --> 01:06:08,995
The Jeans, the T-shirt, it's...
it's a great look on you.

983
01:06:08,996 --> 01:06:12,039
- Yeah?
- You should wear it to class sometime.

984
01:06:13,891 --> 01:06:15,857
Do you mind, I'd
love to get the scores.

985
01:06:15,929 --> 01:06:18,549
No, no, you go ahead,
I'm gonna read the paper.

986
01:06:19,787 --> 01:06:21,250
Oh, I didn't tell you...

987
01:06:22,348 --> 01:06:26,827
I RECIEVED a few invitations from some
European universities to lecture on my book.

988
01:06:27,028 --> 01:06:27,828
Oh, that's nice!

989
01:06:27,905 --> 01:06:31,913
Yeah, I told 'em, of course, that...
l wanted to check with you first.

990
01:06:33,262 --> 01:06:38,221
- Sounds good, for how long?
- Three months, starting in June after the term ends.

991
01:06:38,882 --> 01:06:41,338
- Three months?
- Um-huh.

992
01:06:42,657 --> 01:06:45,986
All right, guys, c'mon, let's get
a rally going here, c'mon, c'mon.

993
01:06:46,121 --> 01:06:48,775
<i>I never could understand
people's fascination with baseball.

994
01:06:48,935 --> 01:06:52,374
I don't see the point of playing a game
where you wind up at the same place you started.

995
01:06:52,935 --> 01:06:58,579
Well, actually, this should interest you,
because it's about stats and averages.

996
01:06:59,079 --> 01:07:00,841
Stats and averages?
Explain that to me.

997
01:07:00,876 --> 01:07:03,758
<i>Well, see that, every
time a player comes up,

998
01:07:03,784 --> 01:07:07,378
<i>they flash that three-digit number,
and that is the player's average.

999
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:12,026
<i>That is, how many times he HITS the ball,
in RATIO to how many times he comes-up to bat.

1000
01:07:12,085 --> 01:07:13,251
Now, which number is it?

1001
01:07:13,273 --> 01:07:21,448
<i>...equation such as the second derivative of the function f
with respect to the variable x equals a constant...

1002
01:07:28,358 --> 01:07:32,721
Anybody see the game yesterday?
That Marrakesh, what a bum, huh?

1003
01:07:36,193 --> 01:07:38,843
Let me try putting this another way.

1004
01:07:40,071 --> 01:07:45,348
When measuring trajectories, if a batter hits a ball,
how can we determine how far that ball will go?

1005
01:07:45,508 --> 01:07:48,179
<i>What are the variables
needed to hit a home run,

1006
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:50,849
pretending for a moment that
the bum COULD hit a home run?

1007
01:07:52,064 --> 01:07:56,914
- The VELOCITY with which the ball leaves the bat?
- The velocity! Correct!

1008
01:07:56,942 --> 01:07:58,723
<i>- I have a question.
- Um-hum.

1009
01:07:58,867 --> 01:08:01,391
Does a rising fastball really rise?

1010
01:08:05,258 --> 01:08:07,919
I don't know.
I'll have to ask my wife.

1011
01:08:09,999 --> 01:08:16,096
I could not believe it, suddenly the room
was filled with this tangible energy.

1012
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:21,822
We were actually exchanging ideas.
We were connected somehow.

1013
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:26,435
They participated,
they questioned, they stayed!

1014
01:08:28,009 --> 01:08:33,122
Rose, I cannot thank you enough. I was a better
teacher today than I've ever been, because of you.

1015
01:08:33,123 --> 01:08:34,962
Well, thank you, thank you very much.

1016
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:36,479
- Oh.
- Oh.

1017
01:08:37,465 --> 01:08:38,254
Fresh pepper?

1018
01:08:38,354 --> 01:08:42,188
No! She doesn't care for pepper,
but I'll have some, thanks.

1019
01:08:42,603 --> 01:08:46,437
Oh, and could you bring her a
little side dish of extra dressing?

1020
01:08:46,438 --> 01:08:48,855
She likes a little extra, thank you.

1021
01:08:48,856 --> 01:08:50,272
<i>Certainly, right away.

1022
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:56,204
So, I really feel that I should return the favor,
is there anything that I can do for you?

1023
01:08:56,305 --> 01:08:58,536
Anything that you... you want from me?

1024
01:09:04,591 --> 01:09:06,119
I'll have to think about that.

1025
01:09:06,841 --> 01:09:09,700
- Ma'am?
- Okay, just glop it on.

1026
01:09:10,858 --> 01:09:11,825
Thank you.

1027
01:09:13,110 --> 01:09:14,698
Enjoy your dinner.

1028
01:09:18,106 --> 01:09:20,966
- You're not eating.
- No, I'm watching your ritual.

1029
01:09:21,181 --> 01:09:22,996
- My what?
- Your ritual.

1030
01:09:23,107 --> 01:09:25,823
I just about got your sequence now, I think.

1031
01:09:26,018 --> 01:09:27,167
- My sequence?
- Yes!

1032
01:09:27,202 --> 01:09:31,979
You always start-out by
rotating the plate counterclockwise,

1033
01:09:32,139 --> 01:09:37,144
cut on the diagonal...
you remove the unwanted elements...

1034
01:09:38,096 --> 01:09:41,291
and... and now, I believe,
comes my favorite part:

1035
01:09:41,737 --> 01:09:44,401
- What?
- The loading of the fork.

1036
01:09:44,436 --> 01:09:48,893
I find it's just fascinating, the percentages
that you use of the different vegetables

1037
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:56,240
to create that ONE, harmoniously balanced, perfect bite.

1038
01:10:13,003 --> 01:10:15,159
You have a little...

1039
01:10:19,103 --> 01:10:20,396
Don't smear it.

1040
01:10:29,814 --> 01:10:33,133
That might stain, you might want to
put a little soap on that.

1041
01:10:34,473 --> 01:10:37,938
I'll... be right back.

1042
01:11:01,621 --> 01:11:04,497
<i>I want to ask you something,
just to reassure myself.

1043
01:11:04,656 --> 01:11:07,596
<i>- Don't stop.
- What do you think, I'm... I'm a machine?

1044
01:11:07,756 --> 01:11:11,834
<i>It is true for you, isn't it? This
overwhelming feeling we have for each other.

1045
01:11:11,869 --> 01:11:14,358
<i>It's as true for you
as it is for me, isn't it?

1046
01:11:14,493 --> 01:11:18,569
<i>- C'mon, c'mon, you're doing great, keep it up.
- Okay, ready?

1047
01:11:19,771 --> 01:11:23,577
Listen to that music, it's so ridiculous,
doesn't that just infuriate you?

1048
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:25,343
Yeah, I'm livid.

1049
01:11:27,087 --> 01:11:32,955
Rose, I came by your office today to take
you out to lunch, and you weren't there.

1050
01:11:33,684 --> 01:11:35,699
Where were you, at a
staff meeting or something?

1051
01:11:35,763 --> 01:11:37,334
No, I had lunch with Henry.

1052
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:44,198
Rose, he's a friend of mine,
but you have to watch out for him.

1053
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,266
Believe me, I'm not his type.

1054
01:11:46,311 --> 01:11:50,458
No, no, no, I'm serious, he
has trouble controlling himself.

1055
01:11:50,959 --> 01:11:51,928
What, what, what?

1056
01:11:52,263 --> 01:11:54,551
- Uh, did you pull something?
- I think so.

1057
01:11:54,699 --> 01:11:56,654
- Where?
- Right here.

1058
01:11:56,893 --> 01:11:59,383
- Right here?
- Yeah, oh, a little lower.

1059
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:07,260
Lower, closer to the spine, oh,
there, yeah, uh-huh, oh, yeah.

1060
01:12:08,726 --> 01:12:12,384
That's it, lean back into it.

1061
01:12:13,747 --> 01:12:19,504
You know, I was thinking, maybe you'd like to
meet me in Europe after your summer classes end.

1062
01:12:19,663 --> 01:12:22,994
We never had any kind of
honeymoon, vacation thing.

1063
01:12:22,998 --> 01:12:25,893
That's right. I would... gosh,
I would just love that.

1064
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:28,250
Would you?

1065
01:12:32,577 --> 01:12:38,775
- What's the matter, am I pressing too hard?
- No, no, no, it's just that... I'm all sweaty, and,

1066
01:12:38,935 --> 01:12:40,448
I have to floss.

1067
01:12:45,133 --> 01:12:47,327
When ya gotta floss, ya gotta floss.

1068
01:12:58,503 --> 01:13:00,481
<i>Claire, I don't know how to ask for it.

1069
01:13:00,923 --> 01:13:04,598
<i>I mean, we're so polite to each other, sometimes
I feel like we're roommates at a charm school.

1070
01:13:04,601 --> 01:13:07,598
Rose, wait, hold-on a sec,
I gotta put you on the speaker.

1071
01:13:08,236 --> 01:13:10,681
I am so frustrated, Claire,
I don't know what to do.

1072
01:13:10,842 --> 01:13:14,344
<i>Relax, give him a look that
let's him know you want SEX.

1073
01:13:14,379 --> 01:13:16,556
I tried that once, he thought
I had something's in my eye.

1074
01:13:16,837 --> 01:13:19,383
I'm talking about a look
that generates some HEAT.

1075
01:13:19,397 --> 01:13:23,354
God, you know, sometimes I swear he
feels something, too, I'm just not that sure.

1076
01:13:23,515 --> 01:13:29,014
<i>Men aren't that bright, Rose. It's easy.
Be subtle, mysterious, seductive.

1077
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:33,115
Subtle, mysterious, seductive?
Why don't men come with instructions?

1078
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:35,129
I gotta go... I got... bye, bye.

1079
01:13:40,669 --> 01:13:45,464
- More coffee?
- Oo, yeah, thanks. Well, my tickets just arrived.

1080
01:13:45,625 --> 01:13:49,677
My first lecture is in Paris,
on the 24th, I leave Saturday.

1081
01:13:49,988 --> 01:13:51,053
Great.

1082
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:53,933
- Do you want an English muffin or anything?
- No, no thanks.

1083
01:13:54,898 --> 01:13:57,093
Well, all right, I'm off, I have
to go, I have an early class.

1084
01:13:57,128 --> 01:13:58,826
All right, have a nice day.

1085
01:13:59,597 --> 01:14:02,848
Yeah. Well. Yeah. All right.

1086
01:14:02,883 --> 01:14:05,127
- Oh! By the way,
- Um-huh?

1087
01:14:05,461 --> 01:14:09,700
Ah... would telling you now that I'd like
sex TONIGHT be enough of a warning?

1088
01:14:12,171 --> 01:14:15,000
Or should... should... should we wait
'til you come back from Europe?

1089
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:16,938
Yeah? Right? That's better.

1090
01:14:16,973 --> 01:14:21,006
No, no, no, that's fine... that's fine.

1091
01:14:23,965 --> 01:14:28,771
All right, well, I guess
I'll... see you tonight.

1092
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,155
Have a nice day.

1093
01:14:39,279 --> 01:14:41,187
<i>Have you ever tried making love?

1094
01:14:41,277 --> 01:14:44,275
Well, that's just it, our relationship
was never based on that.

1095
01:14:45,433 --> 01:14:50,726
I don't understand, things were going so well.
Having sex now will ruin everything.

1096
01:14:51,953 --> 01:14:54,221
You're a very sick man,
you know that?

1097
01:15:24,497 --> 01:15:26,552
I have the game on for ya.

1098
01:15:28,172 --> 01:15:30,685
Oh, great.

1099
01:15:32,657 --> 01:15:34,106
Some wine?

1100
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:37,620
Oh, I don't know, Rose, before bed?
I'll wake up with a headache.

1101
01:15:37,655 --> 01:15:40,472
- One glass.
- All right, all right, one glass.

1102
01:15:40,572 --> 01:15:41,518
One glass.

1103
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:50,882
- Same score?
- Um-huh.

1104
01:15:53,885 --> 01:15:58,504
<i>This is good, it's sweet.
I normally don't like sweet, but...

1105
01:15:59,453 --> 01:16:04,772
- this is good.
- I'm glad you like it. Do you...

1106
01:16:07,841 --> 01:16:11,415
Would you mind terribly
if we MUTED the TV?

1107
01:16:12,216 --> 01:16:13,642
Oh, okay.

1108
01:16:18,772 --> 01:16:24,110
- Wha, wha, what are you doing?
- Ah, nothing... much.

1109
01:16:25,279 --> 01:16:27,424
All right. All right.

1110
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:32,395
Would it be all right if I sat down?

1111
01:16:43,862 --> 01:16:47,317
The wine, it... made me warm.

1112
01:16:47,352 --> 01:16:48,763
- I can fix that.
- It's okay!

1113
01:16:54,257 --> 01:16:55,370
Good game?

1114
01:16:56,469 --> 01:16:57,738
I can't hear it.

1115
01:17:07,365 --> 01:17:08,645
Ya know, Rose...

1116
01:17:10,489 --> 01:17:13,526
- No, that's all right, that's all right.
- Did I hurt you?

1117
01:17:13,543 --> 01:17:17,747
No, no, no, no, you didn't hurt me, no,
you missed me, and you didn't spill a drop.

1118
01:17:19,386 --> 01:17:24,529
- I guess...
- That's funny? I guess it's kinda funny.

1119
01:17:26,523 --> 01:17:29,922
Do you think we could...
turn the TV OFF?

1120
01:17:30,123 --> 01:17:31,105
All right.

1121
01:17:35,362 --> 01:17:37,155
That's better.

1122
01:17:37,856 --> 01:17:39,113
We have to relax.

1123
01:17:40,449 --> 01:17:41,822
I agree.

1124
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:48,219
So... uh...
uh... uh...

1125
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:51,303
- How... how... how are classes?
- Going well.

1126
01:17:51,791 --> 01:17:57,070
- And... and... and... and your book? How's that...
- The outline is actually...

1127
01:17:58,066 --> 01:18:00,013
- It's...
- It is what?

1128
01:18:00,248 --> 01:18:02,274
It's coming along...

1129
01:18:03,758 --> 01:18:05,074
it's almost there.

1130
01:18:06,305 --> 01:18:10,472
It's not at all what I expected,
it's... it's harder than I thought.

1131
01:18:11,942 --> 01:18:13,250
But I'll uh...

1132
01:18:13,287 --> 01:18:15,088
- You'll "I'll uh" what?
- I'll uh......

1133
01:18:16,221 --> 01:18:18,726
- I... I... I'm sure that I'll...
- What are you sure of?

1134
01:18:18,761 --> 01:18:21,111
I'm sure I'll... I'll get there.

1135
01:18:23,096 --> 01:18:24,968
I want you to get there.

1136
01:18:35,611 --> 01:18:36,750
What did you say?

1137
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:41,109
- Rose...
- Talk to me.

1138
01:19:03,578 --> 01:19:04,816
Oh, Rose.

1139
01:19:05,678 --> 01:19:08,398
- Oh, yes. Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

1140
01:19:08,558 --> 01:19:12,925
Oh, God. Oh, Rose. Oh, God.

1141
01:19:13,113 --> 01:19:15,561
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

1142
01:19:15,562 --> 01:19:16,597
No, no.

1143
01:19:16,952 --> 01:19:19,042
- I don't want to do this!
- What?

1144
01:19:19,077 --> 01:19:21,010
I'm sorry, Rose, I'm sorry.

1145
01:19:21,669 --> 01:19:24,120
<i>I'm sorry.
Sorry.

1146
01:19:59,969 --> 01:20:05,495
I have to say, Rose, I'm a little...
a little confused, a little disappointed.

1147
01:20:08,849 --> 01:20:11,595
Everything was going so well.

1148
01:20:12,776 --> 01:20:14,342
At least, I thought so, didn't you?

1149
01:20:15,727 --> 01:20:19,640
Well, is that the truth, or is that
some kind of female manipulation?

1150
01:20:19,675 --> 01:20:22,424
I wish... I wish you would just tell me the truth.

1151
01:20:22,681 --> 01:20:27,335
You knew the agreement, you knew how I felt.
Did you think that would change?

1152
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:29,051
Why?

1153
01:20:31,979 --> 01:20:35,677
I... I hoped that, even though
I initially made the offer,

1154
01:20:35,712 --> 01:20:38,076
that by now you would have seen
there was no need for it.

1155
01:20:38,236 --> 01:20:39,910
I'd hoped that we'd got beyond it.

1156
01:20:41,195 --> 01:20:43,193
Did you honestly think
this was the next step?

1157
01:20:46,385 --> 01:20:48,570
Geez, Rose, you have it all backwards.

1158
01:20:48,628 --> 01:20:51,920
You know, what we have usually comes
after all this nonsense is over.

1159
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:55,598
Most never get to where we are
in regards to sharing and respect.

1160
01:20:55,633 --> 01:20:57,471
Instead they try to keep the sex going,

1161
01:20:57,506 --> 01:21:00,236
and when that fades, then...
then they're on to someone new.

1162
01:21:00,335 --> 01:21:04,361
That's why... that's why our relationship works
because it was never physical.

1163
01:21:04,501 --> 01:21:07,699
I took every precaution to make sure
there was no physical attraction!

1164
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:14,563
Rose, Rose, I'm sorry.

1165
01:21:15,289 --> 01:21:20,252
Rose... it... it's just that...

1166
01:21:20,295 --> 01:21:22,983
I've never had this with
a woman before, the way

1167
01:21:22,984 --> 01:21:25,672
I can talk about everything
and share everything with you.

1168
01:21:29,612 --> 01:21:32,841
Are you... are you not satisfied with me?

1169
01:21:34,309 --> 01:21:35,279
<i>Rose.

1170
01:21:36,709 --> 01:21:38,878
<i>Maybe... maybe... maybe this is
something that had to come up,

1171
01:21:38,979 --> 01:21:41,090
<i>something we had to
struggle through together.

1172
01:21:42,408 --> 01:21:45,971
<i>Maybe... maybe this lecture tour
is coming at a good time, maybe...

1173
01:21:47,271 --> 01:21:49,534
we could use some distance
from each other for a while.

1174
01:21:50,484 --> 01:21:51,937
<i>Don't you think?

1175
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,280
<i>I thought we were good friends.

1176
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,287
Talk to me, Rose.

1177
01:21:59,921 --> 01:22:03,173
<i>Rose, c'mon, let me in, I'm... I'm sorry.

1178
01:22:04,173 --> 01:22:05,029
Rose.

1179
01:22:08,153 --> 01:22:09,963
<i>C'mon, open the door.

1180
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:21,458
<i>Would you open the door, please.
Come on, Rose.

1181
01:23:34,074 --> 01:23:35,826
<i>What are you doing here?

1182
01:23:39,712 --> 01:23:43,657
I just came to sleep in my own bed,
is that okay?

1183
01:23:45,289 --> 01:23:47,592
What happened? Is it Gregory?

1184
01:23:49,427 --> 01:23:52,787
<i>I don't want to say, "I told you so."

1185
01:23:52,948 --> 01:23:55,614
- Mom.
- What?

1186
01:23:56,876 --> 01:24:01,673
When I was a baby,
did you think I was pretty?

1187
01:24:03,822 --> 01:24:06,595
I don't know what you mean,
but all babies are pretty.

1188
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:11,161
No... no, I mean ME.

1189
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:14,533
Me.

1190
01:24:15,994 --> 01:24:18,394
You must have thought
SOMETHING about how I looked.

1191
01:24:21,015 --> 01:24:23,636
Oh, what's pretty, anyway?

1192
01:24:24,163 --> 01:24:26,181
<i>What good did it do your sister?

1193
01:24:34,788 --> 01:24:38,862
Do you remember...
when I was a little girl?

1194
01:24:40,924 --> 01:24:49,020
You used to tell me to... push up my nose
up with my index finger, so it wouldn't droop.

1195
01:24:49,055 --> 01:24:52,341
- I did not! Are you drunk?
- No.

1196
01:24:52,798 --> 01:24:56,835
That's what you told me.
It's funny, too, because...

1197
01:24:57,236 --> 01:25:01,473
l never would have...
thought I... I wasn't pretty...

1198
01:25:02,289 --> 01:25:04,768
if it weren't for those things you SAID.

1199
01:25:06,031 --> 01:25:10,444
If you've come home to say more
cruel things to me, I'm going to bed.

1200
01:25:11,271 --> 01:25:13,208
- Mom.
- What?

1201
01:25:16,049 --> 01:25:19,251
- How did it feel?
- How did WHAT feel?

1202
01:25:19,928 --> 01:25:22,657
- Being beautiful?
- Oh, stop it!

1203
01:25:22,692 --> 01:25:23,971
<i>No, I mean it.

1204
01:25:24,895 --> 01:25:26,228
<i>How did it feel...

1205
01:25:26,737 --> 01:25:31,735
having people look at
you with... such admiration?

1206
01:25:33,263 --> 01:25:40,832
Looking at yourself in the mirror...
with... such appreciation?

1207
01:25:43,895 --> 01:25:45,603
How did that feel?

1208
01:25:54,814 --> 01:25:56,791
It was wonderful.

1209
01:26:05,707 --> 01:26:09,358
Yeah.
I bet.

1210
01:26:17,677 --> 01:26:21,698
<i>- Hello.
- Hi, this is Gregory, is Rose there?

1211
01:26:21,733 --> 01:26:24,081
<i>No, she's gone out, can I take a message?

1212
01:26:24,593 --> 01:26:28,931
No, Hannah, the point is, I've... I've been giving
you messages, and she hasn't called back.

1213
01:26:28,956 --> 01:26:33,046
- I... I... I want to say goodbye to my wife.
- I'll tell her.

1214
01:26:45,845 --> 01:26:48,499
<i>Rose, I hated the
way we left each other.

1215
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:51,153
<i>I wanted to say goodbye to you
personally, not through your mother.

1216
01:26:52,942 --> 01:26:56,329
<i>I don't like leaving this way,
but my... my... my plane is here.

1217
01:26:57,422 --> 01:27:00,171
<i>I hope your mother
doesn't erase this... this message.

1218
01:27:03,299 --> 01:27:05,804
<i>I... I... I don't know what else to say.

1219
01:27:08,916 --> 01:27:11,335
<i>Rose, I hated the
way we left each other.

1220
01:27:11,581 --> 01:27:14,244
<i>I wanted to say goodbye to you
personally, not through your mother.

1221
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:29,190
You're up early.

1222
01:27:30,836 --> 01:27:32,482
I haven't been to bed.

1223
01:27:34,567 --> 01:27:37,407
- You haven't been to bed?
- No.

1224
01:27:39,203 --> 01:27:40,451
Why not?

1225
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:46,474
- What's the matter?
- I had a lot to think about... after you left.

1226
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:52,868
It's awful thing to do to a woman my age...
leave her alone with her thoughts.

1227
01:27:59,653 --> 01:28:01,578
You really love him, don't ya?

1228
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:07,547
Well, you do, it's obvious.

1229
01:28:09,327 --> 01:28:10,736
I know.

1230
01:28:12,126 --> 01:28:15,541
Ya know, that... that feeling that...

1231
01:28:16,507 --> 01:28:18,818
you have for Gregory...

1232
01:28:22,582 --> 01:28:29,518
l don't think I ever felt that,
not even for your father.

1233
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:38,041
It's not... not easy thing for me to say,
especially to you.

1234
01:28:40,733 --> 01:28:44,760
It's an awful thing
to look back on your life, and...

1235
01:28:45,573 --> 01:28:48,312
realize that you've settled.

1236
01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:54,585
The problem was that I...
I always felt l had more time.

1237
01:28:54,646 --> 01:29:01,323
I was... well, I mean now I...
inside, I... I feel... young.

1238
01:29:01,482 --> 01:29:07,018
Like a kid, that it's... just a beginning...
I have everything ahead of me.

1239
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,486
But I don't.

1240
01:29:12,922 --> 01:29:17,831
So... I guess...
I AM jealous.

1241
01:29:20,437 --> 01:29:26,776
Ya know, parents... they don't have
a plan to... hurt their children.

1242
01:29:28,593 --> 01:29:30,833
I never wanted to hurt you.

1243
01:29:31,550 --> 01:29:36,313
Mom, it's... I'm not that hurt.

1244
01:29:37,707 --> 01:29:39,758
Do you know what I thought
when you were a baby?

1245
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:41,558
What?

1246
01:29:41,947 --> 01:29:47,558
That you looked JUST like your father,
and that Claire looked like me.

1247
01:29:48,863 --> 01:29:49,902
What's that?

1248
01:29:54,861 --> 01:30:01,369
She was so pretty, even then.
Look at those eyes, those lips.

1249
01:30:02,097 --> 01:30:03,788
That's not Claire, that's you.

1250
01:30:04,977 --> 01:30:08,774
Me? Uh-uh! I never saw this picture.

1251
01:30:10,154 --> 01:30:13,827
- I found it when I was re-arranging the closet.
- This was me?

1252
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:18,251
I... I was pretty?

1253
01:30:19,613 --> 01:30:23,572
Your father adored you...
but you know that.

1254
01:30:23,849 --> 01:30:27,799
He never felt that way
about Claire... only you.

1255
01:30:29,324 --> 01:30:32,629
I don't think he ever HELD
a baby until you came.

1256
01:30:33,841 --> 01:30:36,478
And he never wanted to let you go.

1257
01:30:42,158 --> 01:30:46,095
- I'm glad you found this, Mom.
- Yeah, I am, too.

1258
01:30:49,374 --> 01:30:51,007
She was very pretty.

1259
01:30:52,295 --> 01:30:53,807
You were very pretty.

1260
01:30:56,206 --> 01:30:57,762
Remember that.

1261
01:31:55,884 --> 01:31:58,119
<i>Thank you all very
much for this warm welcome.

1262
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:01,294
It's truly an honor for me
to be here in your country.

1263
01:32:01,383 --> 01:32:06,935
Hello, Rose, I would love to speak with you.
<i>I never seem to catch you at home.

1264
01:32:07,079 --> 01:32:10,120
<i>I really think we should diss...
discuss this, Rose, and believe me,

1265
01:32:10,172 --> 01:32:13,998
<i>I have no judgment over what happened,
well, I just think we should talk.

1266
01:32:14,033 --> 01:32:17,436
<i>I'm leaving for Venice tomorrow
and I wanted to wish you a happy birthday.

1267
01:32:17,664 --> 01:32:22,555
I do have a... a present for you,
it's a... it's a week at a baseball camp.

1268
01:32:23,156 --> 01:32:24,055
Rose...

1269
01:32:34,628 --> 01:32:36,354
<i>Hello, Rose?

1270
01:32:39,503 --> 01:32:41,249
<i>Rose, are you there?

1271
01:32:46,263 --> 01:32:50,178
<i>- Henry, have you heard from her?
- She apparently cancelled her summer classes.

1272
01:32:50,339 --> 01:32:51,114
<i>How do you know that?

1273
01:32:51,181 --> 01:32:52,032
I called her mother.

1274
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:54,370
<i>She said Rose took a couple of months off.

1275
01:32:54,579 --> 01:33:00,308
- Rose, here, try this one, it's a size eight.
- Oh, I like the black one and I need a size six.

1276
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:05,194
<i>Hello, Rose, it's very important, I have
to say, I'm very surprised, I can't believe

1277
01:33:05,195 --> 01:33:08,813
<i>how childishly you're
behaving, it's so unlike you.

1278
01:33:08,973 --> 01:33:12,415
- How did she finally persuade YOU to come?
- It's a long story.

1279
01:33:12,789 --> 01:33:16,010
I'm changing my plans, I'm
coming home right after London,

1280
01:33:16,045 --> 01:33:18,354
<i>I'm supposed to be in
New York next Monday.

1281
01:33:18,389 --> 01:33:24,515
<i>My number here is:
01-71-25773-55.

1282
01:33:25,921 --> 01:33:28,743
<i>All prime numbers, by the way.

1283
01:33:41,715 --> 01:33:43,319
Hello?

1284
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:58,175
Rose? You here?

1285
01:34:04,886 --> 01:34:05,632
Rose?

1286
01:34:05,715 --> 01:34:08,761
<i>Hi! Don't come in, I'll be right out.

1287
01:34:32,152 --> 01:34:33,965
<i>May I have a glass, too, please?

1288
01:34:57,403 --> 01:35:00,736
Good to see you, Greg,
how was your trip?

1289
01:35:05,197 --> 01:35:06,841
Are you all right?

1290
01:35:07,339 --> 01:35:11,064
Oh, just a little dizzy, the
traveling doesn't agree with me.

1291
01:35:12,324 --> 01:35:13,632
You need a glass of water?

1292
01:35:13,673 --> 01:35:18,104
- Wha... what happened to you?
- Nothing, I just made a few changes.

1293
01:35:18,673 --> 01:35:21,722
- What did you do to your hair?
- I lightened it.

1294
01:35:21,907 --> 01:35:23,601
Your face...

1295
01:35:25,622 --> 01:35:27,019
You're wearing make-up.

1296
01:35:27,861 --> 01:35:31,144
Yeah, well, women do wear
makeup from time to time, Greg.

1297
01:35:31,547 --> 01:35:34,544
It's not like I had SURGERY or anything,
although my mother offered.

1298
01:35:34,545 --> 01:35:35,933
But... you never...

1299
01:35:36,384 --> 01:35:38,801
- Are you hungry?
- You never wore makeup.

1300
01:35:39,874 --> 01:35:45,390
I know, the... the "No Frills Girl", RIGHT?
Well, like I said, I made a few changes.

1301
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:48,010
- And you lost weight, too?
- Well, thank you!

1302
01:35:48,338 --> 01:35:51,537
Now, these have no oil or
butter, trust me, it's delicious,

1303
01:35:51,571 --> 01:35:52,931
you just have to get used to it.

1304
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,598
Among other things!
Wha... what've you done?

1305
01:35:55,629 --> 01:35:58,777
What've I done, I... I... I'm
wearing makeup, I lost a few pounds,

1306
01:35:58,812 --> 01:36:00,655
I didn't name names
before a Senate Committee.

1307
01:36:00,815 --> 01:36:04,601
Well... well, forgive me, but, you don't return
my calls, you completely cut me off, and then

1308
01:36:04,636 --> 01:36:06,770
I... I returned to find this... I'm...

1309
01:36:09,487 --> 01:36:11,614
- I... I'm...
- What?

1310
01:36:11,649 --> 01:36:12,873
Speechless.

1311
01:36:15,807 --> 01:36:20,827
- I guess you don't like it.
- Don't like it? I'm in shock.

1312
01:36:21,045 --> 01:36:24,202
I... I come home to find a completely
different woman in my apartment.

1313
01:36:24,237 --> 01:36:25,252
<i>Why did you do it?

1314
01:36:25,602 --> 01:36:28,601
Wait a minute! Why do I have to
EXPLAIN this to you or ANYBODY.

1315
01:36:28,761 --> 01:36:31,003
- I'm not anybody, I'm your husband.
- You could've fooled me.

1316
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:33,393
And I married a woman
who looked a certain way.

1317
01:36:34,558 --> 01:36:39,615
- To tell you the truth, I feel sort of betrayed.
- Betrayed! Oh! Please! Gregory, c'mon!

1318
01:36:39,676 --> 01:36:42,031
- You had no right.
- I had no RIGHT?

1319
01:36:42,066 --> 01:36:43,905
Why did you do this to me?

1320
01:36:44,035 --> 01:36:47,266
Do WHAT to you? I don't do
ANYTHING to you! That's the problem.

1321
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:50,270
What's the difference what I LOOK
like? You never looked at me ANYHOW.

1322
01:36:50,731 --> 01:36:53,759
If physical appearance doesn't matter,
then what's wrong with THIS appearance?

1323
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:56,203
I happen to like the way I look.

1324
01:36:56,387 --> 01:36:59,387
And I'm sorry if it upsets
your mathematical equation.

1325
01:36:59,422 --> 01:37:03,128
"Handsome, frightened man marries
unattractive, desperate woman."

1326
01:37:03,129 --> 01:37:04,707
- Is that how the ad read?
- No, no.

1327
01:37:04,742 --> 01:37:07,923
It's simply that I was
expecting someone ELSE.

1328
01:37:07,978 --> 01:37:12,013
I... I... I'm sorry, I don't know what to
say, I guess I'll just have to get used to it.

1329
01:37:12,261 --> 01:37:15,992
No you don't... you don't have
to get used to anything.

1330
01:37:16,398 --> 01:37:21,495
- Wha... what do you mean?
- Gregory, I don't want to continue.

1331
01:37:23,255 --> 01:37:25,335
I... I... I... I don't understand.

1332
01:37:27,056 --> 01:37:30,872
I... I really want to apologize.

1333
01:37:31,255 --> 01:37:35,053
I... settled for something
that I didn't want.

1334
01:37:35,686 --> 01:37:38,863
I thought I could live with that, I
thought that it would be enough, but...

1335
01:37:38,966 --> 01:37:42,244
I lied, I lied to myself, I lied to you.

1336
01:37:42,404 --> 01:37:47,852
To tell you the truth, I think your theories
about relationships are total bullshit.

1337
01:37:47,886 --> 01:37:51,364
I believe in love and
lust and sex and romance,

1338
01:37:51,365 --> 01:37:54,844
I don't want everything to add
up to some perfect equation.

1339
01:37:54,879 --> 01:37:59,477
I want mess and chaos, I want someone
to go crazy out of his brain for me.

1340
01:37:59,638 --> 01:38:02,437
I want to feel passion and
heat and sweat and madness!

1341
01:38:02,438 --> 01:38:05,236
I want Valentines and cupids
and all the rest of that crap!

1342
01:38:05,396 --> 01:38:09,757
I want it all, and I want to thank you.
I want to thank you, Greg, because

1343
01:38:09,917 --> 01:38:14,551
you FORCED me to look at things that I was
TOO lazy or too SCARED to look at.

1344
01:38:14,711 --> 01:38:19,228
I mean, can you imagine, all this time
I... I kept up this ridiculous fantasy that

1345
01:38:19,388 --> 01:38:22,778
- you, like Alex, would fall in love with me.
- Rose...Rose... no...

1346
01:38:22,813 --> 01:38:25,344
I know, I know, I know, I was wrong,
it was unfair of me to think you'd change.

1347
01:38:25,504 --> 01:38:28,966
- Rose... Rose... but I think...
- I know what you think, Greg, and just let me finish

1348
01:38:29,026 --> 01:38:31,272
- what I was going...
- Rose, Rose, I feel...

1349
01:38:31,425 --> 01:38:34,421
You feel very strongly about
your beliefs, I appreciate that, but...

1350
01:38:34,581 --> 01:38:38,401
I'm sorry that I broke our agreement, it was just
that I fell in love with you... stupid, right?

1351
01:38:38,402 --> 01:38:41,161
Rose... Rose... I feel... that...

1352
01:38:41,459 --> 01:38:45,968
I don't want you to feel bad.
Because I'm not in love with you anymore.

1353
01:38:48,616 --> 01:38:50,337
What?

1354
01:38:51,317 --> 01:38:54,896
Which ironically makes me perfect for
this marriage, except now I don't want it.

1355
01:39:01,989 --> 01:39:06,838
Suddenly... dinner doesn't seem like
such a good idea, does it?

1356
01:39:09,685 --> 01:39:12,713
I should... I should go.

1357
01:39:13,646 --> 01:39:18,929
- Whe... whe... where are you going? Your mother's?
- Just until I find my own place.

1358
01:39:21,284 --> 01:39:25,934
I... I hope at some point we can pick up
where we left off, as friends.

1359
01:39:26,334 --> 01:39:26,934
Friends?

1360
01:39:26,939 --> 01:39:32,945
I really do thank you, Greg, you're the first
man who wanted to marry me... for any reason.

1361
01:39:35,876 --> 01:39:37,840
Can I call you tomorrow?

1362
01:39:40,953 --> 01:39:42,467
What for?

1363
01:40:05,499 --> 01:40:07,763
<i>You all have copies
of the syllabus, right?

1364
01:40:07,798 --> 01:40:08,520
Yes

1365
01:40:08,521 --> 01:40:11,540
There will be four short
papers on assigned text.

1366
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:15,820
<i>Be prepared to also discuss these in class.

1367
01:40:15,895 --> 01:40:23,764
Now, some of my students from last term can
tell you how important these oral discussions are...

1368
01:40:24,730 --> 01:40:27,999
in... what, what?!

1369
01:40:30,330 --> 01:40:31,915
Yes, I have breasts.

1370
01:40:32,444 --> 01:40:36,806
They CANNOT, however, be the
subject of one of your papers. Now...

1371
01:40:37,007 --> 01:40:39,139
<i>Hey! A double play!

1372
01:40:39,666 --> 01:40:42,982
Of course I'll miss spending time
with her, but I feel proud that I...

1373
01:40:43,017 --> 01:40:45,536
I stood up for what I believe,
I still think I was right,

1374
01:40:45,571 --> 01:40:46,552
it could have worked.

1375
01:40:46,735 --> 01:40:51,097
Obviously not with her, but...
I think it was an invaluable experience.

1376
01:40:53,339 --> 01:40:57,337
- You're in bad shape, aren't you?
- Well, I just told you...

1377
01:40:57,372 --> 01:40:59,316
May I make a suggestion?

1378
01:40:59,476 --> 01:41:03,458
Put all your valuable possessions,
things you REALLY care about, in storage.

1379
01:41:04,394 --> 01:41:05,530
Why?

1380
01:41:05,594 --> 01:41:08,491
Trust me on this, you don't want anything
breakable in your apartment right now.

1381
01:41:08,552 --> 01:41:11,646
Henry, Henry, I just told you, I'm fine.

1382
01:41:11,686 --> 01:41:14,818
Really, I'm actually using
all of this in my next book.

1383
01:41:15,110 --> 01:41:17,298
Especially glass.

1384
01:41:18,349 --> 01:41:21,996
<i>I miss him, Claire,
but I don't think he's ready for me.

1385
01:41:24,465 --> 01:41:28,424
I still can't get used to seeing you
like this, it's sort of unnerving.

1386
01:41:29,127 --> 01:41:30,158
Thanks.

1387
01:41:30,281 --> 01:41:33,978
Makes you just like the rest
of us now, doesn't it? You'll see.

1388
01:41:34,618 --> 01:41:37,149
Now you'll spend an extra
hour in front of the mirror,

1389
01:41:37,219 --> 01:41:40,219
every morning and every night,
as if it'll make any difference.

1390
01:41:40,678 --> 01:41:43,345
Now you'll be the one to
walk into a room and scan it

1391
01:41:43,346 --> 01:41:46,013
for who looks better
than you and who doesn't.

1392
01:41:46,574 --> 01:41:49,975
And as the years go by,
the numbers change...

1393
01:41:50,135 --> 01:41:54,927
until, one day, you walk into a room and
you're the last woman ANY man notices.

1394
01:41:56,992 --> 01:42:01,532
Rose? My God! Rose!

1395
01:42:02,047 --> 01:42:05,495
- Hi, Alex.
- I can't believe it's you.

1396
01:42:05,896 --> 01:42:07,095
My God!

1397
01:42:07,163 --> 01:42:08,617
Alex, get a fucking grip.

1398
01:42:08,704 --> 01:42:10,810
- You look incredible!
- Thank you.

1399
01:42:10,904 --> 01:42:13,209
- Doesn't she look incredible?
- Yes, we already covered that.

1400
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:15,251
- Oh, yes!
- Can I have another drink.

1401
01:42:48,549 --> 01:42:50,778
<i>- I thought you hated salad.
- I do.

1402
01:42:51,345 --> 01:42:55,565
I just can't eat a big cheeseburger
in the middle of the day anymore, ya know?

1403
01:42:55,625 --> 01:42:57,516
- Doesn't it bloat you?
- Bloat me?

1404
01:42:57,684 --> 01:42:59,741
- Yeah.
- No, it doesn't bloat me.

1405
01:42:59,902 --> 01:43:04,728
Actually, I thought it went really well with
the spareribs I had for breakfast this morning.

1406
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:12,864
- What's the matter?
- I'm sorry.

1407
01:43:14,921 --> 01:43:17,776
I just thought we'd always be in the
same boat, ya know what I'm sayin'?

1408
01:43:18,524 --> 01:43:20,341
It made it easier somehow.

1409
01:43:20,947 --> 01:43:22,464
I know.

1410
01:43:26,389 --> 01:43:27,597
Tell you what.

1411
01:43:29,029 --> 01:43:31,835
I'll give you half my salad if you
give me half your burger.

1412
01:43:34,765 --> 01:43:38,587
- We'll need some more dressing.
- Definitely. Waiter!

I don't know WHY she wasn't happy.

1434
01:44:54,731 --> 01:44:57,236
I... I... I don't know how I could
have loved her any more than I did.

1435
01:44:57,789 --> 01:45:00,436
I don't think it would've mattered
how much you loved her.

1436
01:45:01,229 --> 01:45:02,459
- Rose.
- Uh-huh.

1437
01:45:02,694 --> 01:45:05,315
Did you know that Claire
was jealous of you.

1438
01:45:06,279 --> 01:45:08,265
- What! Jealous of me?
- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yes..

1439
01:45:08,282 --> 01:45:10,984
She used to get so mad at me
every time I'd talk about you.

1440
01:45:11,364 --> 01:45:13,125
She thought I had a secret crush on you.

1441
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:16,799
Maybe she was right.

1442
01:45:22,428 --> 01:45:25,943
- Do you want to have dinner with me?
- What?

1443
01:45:27,071 --> 01:45:29,194
Well, I'm asking you if you
want to have dinner with me.

1444
01:45:29,353 --> 01:45:35,464

I'll have to ask Claire.

- All right.
- Okay.

1446

"D"! Congratulations! You're improving!

1447

you're saying about twin primes.

- But I still don't understand.

elements from an infinite set and still HAVE
an infinite number of elements left over?

She can't not talk to me forever,
I... I've got...

1470
01:47:49,766 --> 01:47:50,924
<i> Gregory, what are you doing?

1471
01:47:51,006 --> 01:47:53,089
There're certain things
I have to explain to her.

1472
01:47:53,290 --> 01:47:55,683
<i>I think it's a little late for that, Gregory,
don't you think?

1473
01:47:55,684 --> 01:47:56,318
What!?

1474
01:47:56,753 --> 01:47:58,686
I said, "I think it's a
little late for that, Gregory".

1475
01:47:58,687 --> 01:48:00,619
<i>No, I don't think so.

1476
01:48:00,844 --> 01:48:05,573
What Rose and I have goes
far beyond what normal people...

1477
01:48:05,584 --> 01:48:08,289
<i>What's all that noise? What
are you trying to say, Gregory?

1478
01:48:08,924 --> 01:48:10,350
<i>Gregory, what is going on?

1479
01:48:10,351 --> 01:48:11,460
Could you just...

1480
01:48:11,461 --> 01:48:12,159
<i>Gregory!

1481
01:48:12,260 --> 01:48:13,017
Hannah!

1482
01:48:13,018 --> 01:48:13,240
<i>What!?

1483
01:48:13,275 --> 01:48:14,823
Put her on the God damned
damn phone right now!

1484
01:48:14,824 --> 01:48:16,497
<i>She's not here.

1485
01:48:16,897 --> 01:48:17,765
What!?

1486
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:20,453
<i>Look, I might as well tell you,
she's with Alex now.

1487
01:48:21,676 --> 01:48:22,453
Alex?

1488
01:48:22,835 --> 01:48:25,510
She's with him tonight,
he and Claire split-up.

1489
01:48:25,545 --> 01:48:28,140
I'm sure you know how much
she's always cared for him.

1490
01:48:28,551 --> 01:48:32,386
So, like I said, I see no point
in your pursuing this any further.

1491
01:48:42,144 --> 01:48:48,479
I'm so sorry to have keep you waiting.
So, Mr. Jenkins, which one do you like best?

1492
01:48:48,582 --> 01:48:52,851
To be perfectly honest,
l think you're more beautiful now.

1493
01:48:55,059 --> 01:48:56,507
Good answer.

1494
01:49:01,948 --> 01:49:03,869
Wai... wai... wai... wai...
wait a minute, wait a minute.

1495
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:05,101
What? What?
What's the matter?

1496
01:49:05,136 --> 01:49:08,596
What did you mean by, "You must have
loved me all along but just didn't know it."?

1497
01:49:08,597 --> 01:49:09,560
I don't...

1498
01:49:09,592 --> 01:49:12,256
Yeah, but, wait, wait, wait...
figure it out, 'cause I'd like an answer.

1499
01:49:12,541 --> 01:49:14,584
Well, I don't know, Rose, I
mean, you were different then,

1500
01:49:14,585 --> 01:49:16,527
you weren't the same as you are now.

1501
01:49:16,562 --> 01:49:17,885
So, how could you have LOVED me then?

1502
01:49:18,165 --> 01:49:22,076
Well, I loved you because of who you
were, not because I wanted who you are.

1503
01:49:22,111 --> 01:49:24,586
So now you want who I am
because I'm not who I was anymore?

1504
01:49:26,852 --> 01:49:28,025
Okay...

1505
01:49:29,641 --> 01:49:31,541
Rose, what?
Where are you going?

1506
01:49:32,142 --> 01:49:36,912
You know something, I have dreamt about
this moment from the first day we met.

1507
01:49:37,077 --> 01:49:40,076
I've played it out a
million times in my mind...

1508
01:49:40,077 --> 01:49:42,876
how you'd look, what you'd
say, what you'd think.

1509
01:49:43,177 --> 01:49:44,828
- And guess what?
- What?

1510
01:49:44,863 --> 01:49:46,054
You were better in my head.

1511
01:49:46,151 --> 01:49:48,237
Oh, Rose! Sugar! Maybe I just
had too much to drink, that's all.

1512
01:49:48,295 --> 01:49:53,149
No! No! It's not you, it's me. You see,
I don't feel anything, isn't that great?

1513
01:49:53,571 --> 01:49:57,429
I never thought about what I would feel,
I was only thinking about YOU.

1514
01:49:57,589 --> 01:50:00,943
I only wanted to make YOU happy, I
never thought I was good enough for you.

1515
01:50:00,944 --> 01:50:04,299
Oh, but you are good enough
for me, Rose. You are! You are!

1516
01:50:04,305 --> 01:50:06,110
I know, I know, but Alex...

1517
01:50:06,311 --> 01:50:08,436
you're not good enough for me.

1518
01:50:13,263 --> 01:50:15,000
Okay...

1519
01:50:15,463 --> 01:50:17,346
<i>Oh! She's with Alex now, Henry.

1520
01:50:18,146 --> 01:50:19,652
- Oh, God.
- I can't believe it.

1521
01:50:19,658 --> 01:50:22,095
I don't know what it is, my head or my stomach.

1522
01:50:22,096 --> 01:50:24,364
You need anything?
Drink this! C'mon! Lie down!

1523
01:50:24,419 --> 01:50:27,425
- I think I might have Chinese food poisoning.
- Here, give me your coat.

1524
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:31,188
I ordered Szechwan chicken but they
brought beef, except I think it was a CAT.

1525
01:50:31,189 --> 01:50:32,096
Cat!?

1526
01:50:33,026 --> 01:50:35,533
- I'm so dizzy.
- Easy! Easy!

1527
01:50:35,693 --> 01:50:39,908
I was in... the apartment, all alone, Henry.
I... I didn't know what to do.

1528
01:50:39,909 --> 01:50:42,087
C'mon! Give me your shoe! That's it!

1529
01:50:42,122 --> 01:50:45,929
- I'm sorry, Henry.
- Okay, you'll just stay here then, c'mon, c'mon.

1530
01:50:46,088 --> 01:50:47,808
- Oh, Henry!
- Yeah, that's good!

1531
01:50:48,009 --> 01:50:50,303
- I love Rose.
- I know.

1532
01:50:50,486 --> 01:50:54,404
I... I love the OLD Rose,
the one with no makeup,

1533
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:57,113
and baggy clothes, who
loves the perfect bite.

1534
01:50:58,125 --> 01:51:02,559
I love her, it's real.
It's not based on passion...

1535
01:51:02,879 --> 01:51:05,527
although I feel that.
Or lust...

1536
01:51:06,747 --> 01:51:09,055
although... I feel THAT.

1537
01:51:10,075 --> 01:51:13,815
<i>Or... or even physical attraction,
because she wasn't...

1538
01:51:15,278 --> 01:51:18,210
although I... I thought she
was quite beautiful.

1539
01:51:18,233 --> 01:51:20,443
Her eyes, her mouth,

1540
01:51:20,530 --> 01:51:25,876
<i>the way she held herself,
the way she made fun of herself.

1541
01:51:26,268 --> 01:51:29,800
She eats carrots now,
isn't that tragic?

1542
01:51:31,946 --> 01:51:33,505
What am I going to do?

1543
01:51:34,706 --> 01:51:39,503
Do you know that in the last two years
I've been with 11 different women?

1544
01:51:39,663 --> 01:51:44,753
Most of them half my age, not one
with a sense of humor I understood.

1545
01:51:44,897 --> 01:51:47,912
Now, I don't date these girls
because they're well read.

1546
01:51:47,934 --> 01:51:52,929
I gave one a copy of "A Farewell to
Arms", she thought it was a diet book.

1547
01:52:14,887 --> 01:52:18,868
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I want to see a Miss Morgan.

1548
01:52:18,928 --> 01:52:20,556
It's kind of late to be
visiting people, don't you think?

1549
01:52:20,591 --> 01:52:21,883
Please, just ring her apartment.

1550
01:52:21,976 --> 01:52:24,449
I don't believe Miss Morgan
would care to be disturbed at this hour.

1551
01:52:24,484 --> 01:52:26,228
- You don't believe?
- It's six o'clock in the morning...

1552
01:52:26,284 --> 01:52:28,083
- I believe...
- I don't CARE what you believe.

1553
01:52:28,122 --> 01:52:30,508
- I know her a lot better than you do.
- Go home, Pal!

1554
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:34,660
Rose!

1555
01:52:35,361 --> 01:52:37,281
- Rose!!!!
- Hey! Hey!

1556
01:52:37,316 --> 01:52:38,484
Do you hear that?

1557
01:52:40,798 --> 01:52:42,338
What the hell is going on?

1558
01:52:45,954 --> 01:52:46,990
<i>It's him, isn't it?

1559
01:52:47,525 --> 01:52:48,114
Gregory!

1560
01:52:48,115 --> 01:52:48,761
<i>Rose.

1561
01:52:52,109 --> 01:52:54,895
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh! Do you believe this?

1562
01:52:54,896 --> 01:52:55,655
<i>Rose!!!

1563
01:52:55,656 --> 01:52:56,714
Where are my shoes?

1564
01:52:57,427 --> 01:52:59,528
<i>What does he think he's
doing out there at this hour?

1565
01:52:59,848 --> 01:53:02,267
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go and find out.

1566
01:53:02,428 --> 01:53:03,714
<i>He's insane.

1567
01:53:03,804 --> 01:53:05,979
I know, isn't it wonderful?

1568
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:13,143
Get the hell out of here!

1569
01:53:13,162 --> 01:53:15,175
<i>Don't ya know people
are trying to sleep!

1570
01:53:15,176 --> 01:53:16,629
<i>Yeah! Pipe down!

1571
01:53:18,137 --> 01:53:19,163
You had enough?

1572
01:53:20,777 --> 01:53:24,431
- Stop that! Hey, what are you doing?
- Don't worry Miss Morgan, I'll call the police.

1573
01:53:24,512 --> 01:53:26,270
Don't call the police,
this is my husband!

1574
01:53:26,864 --> 01:53:29,047
- He doesn't have a key?
- Don't ask.

1575
01:53:29,073 --> 01:53:30,453
See, I told you I know her better than you.

1576
01:53:30,454 --> 01:53:31,968
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1577
01:53:32,003 --> 01:53:34,163
What... what... what is going on?
What are you doing here?

1578
01:53:34,189 --> 01:53:36,373
Well, I... I came to see YOU.

1579
01:53:36,421 --> 01:53:37,496
Why?

1580
01:53:37,531 --> 01:53:39,638
- Why did you come to see me?
- Well... I...

1581
01:53:39,968 --> 01:53:42,158
In... in... in light of
our last conversation,

1582
01:53:42,226 --> 01:53:46,081
and after speaking with Henry, I...
I... I've come to realize... that...

1583
01:53:46,241 --> 01:53:47,633
alth... alth... alth...
although you might...

1584
01:53:47,724 --> 01:53:50,404
might have significant reservations
about e... e... even considering...

1585
01:53:50,564 --> 01:53:53,980
Gregory! What! I'm aging here.
What is it you want to say?

1586
01:53:59,877 --> 01:54:01,502
God, you're beautiful.

1587
01:54:04,075 --> 01:54:07,821
Thank you.
Thank you, Gregory.

1588
01:54:13,635 --> 01:54:15,089
What?

1589
01:54:17,751 --> 01:54:23,630
I'm so sorry... for the way I acted
and for the things I said, I...

1590
01:54:24,628 --> 01:54:26,787
- I know that I hurt you, and...
- That's okay.

1591
01:54:26,868 --> 01:54:28,506
- And... and... and that's the...
- I understand.

1592
01:54:28,541 --> 01:54:29,505
last thing in the whole world I...

1593
01:54:29,663 --> 01:54:30,689
I accept your apology.

1594
01:54:30,716 --> 01:54:34,566
Rose! Rose! Please let me finish,
this is important for me to say.

1595
01:54:35,607 --> 01:54:36,916
Okay.

1596
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:42,683
That night...
That... that terrible night... I...

1597
01:54:45,139 --> 01:54:49,140
I... I wanted you so much,
I couldn't see straight.

1598
01:54:53,515 --> 01:54:56,270
I have to make sure you know that.
Rose, it wasn't YOU.

1599
01:54:57,156 --> 01:54:58,932
No! It wasn't you, Rose.

1600
01:54:59,132 --> 01:55:01,812
You're a very... a very sexy girl.

1601
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:08,643
And... and I know that it's unfair of me to say,
now you're with Alex, but...

1602
01:55:09,448 --> 01:55:13,256
Who said I... who said
that ??? I was with Alex?

1603
01:55:14,571 --> 01:55:16,025
Your mother.

1604
01:55:16,684 --> 01:55:19,436
My mother? Oh, great.

1605
01:55:21,762 --> 01:55:24,974
Oh, Greg! I'm not with Alex.

1606
01:55:27,026 --> 01:55:28,690
You're not?

1607
01:55:31,358 --> 01:55:33,169
Well...

1608
01:55:35,437 --> 01:55:36,926
Talk to me.

1609
01:55:38,996 --> 01:55:42,708
Rose... I love you.

1610
01:55:44,953 --> 01:55:48,244
And... I... I want to be married to you.

1611
01:55:49,188 --> 01:55:53,231
Gregory... you are married to me.

1612
01:55:54,786 --> 01:55:59,345
Right... that's right, that's right,
yeah, right.

1613
01:56:02,539 --> 01:56:03,477
What?

1614
01:56:03,512 --> 01:56:08,299
- I'm getting a little dizzy.
- Oh, that's all right, it'll pass, just hold on to me.

1615
01:56:08,458 --> 01:56:10,666
Rose, don't ever leave me again.

1616
01:56:10,667 --> 01:56:12,875
<i>I'm not leaving you... I love you.

1617
01:56:13,818 --> 01:56:16,024
I couldn't stand being away
from you, it was killing me.

1618
01:56:16,025 --> 01:56:17,360
Ah, I'm so glad.

1619
01:56:18,176 --> 01:56:20,665
I don't care if you ARE pretty,
I love you anyway.

1620
01:56:22,174 --> 01:56:26,034
Listen, everything's gonna drop as I get older,
and I'm gaining weight as we SPEAK.

1621
01:56:26,797 --> 01:56:28,894
Well, that's comforting.

1622
02:00:24,625 --> 02:00:27,269
<i>- Get in, Lady.
- Oh, no, not you again!

1623
02:00:27,270 --> 02:00:29,519
<i>- You know this guy?
- He's a good man.

1624
02:00:29,554 --> 02:00:32,085
<i>I can't believe this,
your windows are still broke?

1625
02:00:32,086 --> 02:00:34,617
<i>Complain to the cab company,
I got nothing to do with it.
