00:12:57,749 --> 00:13:00,116
              Get that smile
              off your face.

281
00:13:01,252 --> 00:13:02,384
        (EXCLAIMING)

282
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:20,301
                Darrell.

283
00:13:31,747 --> 00:13:34,948
         Sorry, but I can't
         let the Big Brothers
         see me talking to you.

284
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,883
       Thanks a lot.
       So what's up?

285
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:40,453
      Dean Big Brother Almighty
      went off on me.

286
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:43,889
 I told you not to pledge.
 So what else is new?

287
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:46,124
    I gotta bring a girlie back
    to the Gamma House tonight.

288
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,458
        He thinks I'm a virgin.

289
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,760
 Ah, for once in his life
 he's right.

290
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,228
 (DAP CHUCKLING)
              Come on, Dap.

291
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,296
 So what you want me to do?

292
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:55,431
       The Gamma grapevine says
       we'll be going over
       tomorrow night.

293
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:58,834
        And any fault they find
        will "X" me.
 Mmm-hmm.

294
00:13:58,836 --> 00:14:02,370
         I'm your first cousin,
         family blood.
         You've got to help me.

295
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:05,072
 Hey, Darrell,
 when you needed money,
 I gave it to you.

296
00:14:05,074 --> 00:14:07,541
 When you needed
 your laundry done,
 I did it for you.

297
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:09,843
 I got you food and stuff
 for your Big Brothers.

298
00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:12,879
 I just don't happen
 to have no females
 laying around the dorm.

299
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:15,214
 And even if I did,
 I wouldn't help you
 like that, man.

300
00:14:15,216 --> 00:14:17,783
         This one day,
         can you forget
         about your differences

301
00:14:17,785 --> 00:14:20,051
          with Dean
          Big Brother Almighty?

302
00:14:20,053 --> 00:14:21,485
 You mean Julian?
                 No,

303
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:23,353
     Dean Big Brother Almighty.

304
00:14:23,355 --> 00:14:25,321
     Uh-uh, Julian.
                     No, I mean

305
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,189
     Dean Big Brother Almighty.

306
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:29,424
 All right, already, Darrell.
 Damn.

307
00:14:29,426 --> 00:14:32,794
        Vaughn. Think about me.
        This'll be my neck.

308
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:35,163
  Can't you talk to Rachel?
  She has a lot of girlfriends.

309
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,365
 Rachel? No, no, no, no.

310
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:40,000
 No haps, man. What,
 have you been smoking crack?

311
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,536
 Don't you know any women?

312
00:14:43,538 --> 00:14:45,838
          The ones I know
          I asked already.

313
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,073
 Well, what about the ones
 you don't know?
 Did you ask them?

314
00:14:48,075 --> 00:14:49,174
        What am I gonna say?

315
00:14:50,377 --> 00:14:53,077
    Say, uh...

316
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:55,045
 I don't know. Tell them
 what they want to hear.

317
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:57,113
 You know,
 lie your butt off, man.

318
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,383
 Okay, okay. Better yet,

319
00:15:01,385 --> 00:15:03,852
  just be yourself,
  Darrell,

320
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:05,386
         okay?
               Okay.

321
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:07,187
  Come on, man.
  Come on. Get up.

322
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:08,821
 Come on. Get up, get up.
 Get up.

323
00:15:08,823 --> 00:15:12,457
 You will be
 a Gamma man tomorrow.

324
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:15,126
            Think so?
 You damn skippy.

325
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:17,128
 Wait a minute, wait a minute.
 You go first.

326
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,897
 We wouldn't want
 Dean Big Brother Almighty

327
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:22,232
                 (SHUSHING)
 to see us together,
 would we?

328
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:24,200
             Very funny.

329
00:15:24,202 --> 00:15:25,968
           Thanks, cuz.
           I won't forget this.

330
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,269
 All right, man.

331
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:30,338
                  Gamma!
       Yeah, yeah.

332
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:33,974
 This man had a vision.

333
00:15:36,211 --> 00:15:39,278
 And that vision
 was passed down
 to his son, Hayward.

334
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,879
 Mission College
 was founded to educate

335
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:42,347
 the sons and daughters
 of slaves...

336
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:45,216
      You don't have to
      recite our history to me.

337
00:15:45,218 --> 00:15:46,984
            Now, we have been

338
00:15:46,986 --> 00:15:50,887
           and we'll continue
           to be grateful

339
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:53,322
       for the support
       of the Snodgrass family.

340
00:15:53,324 --> 00:15:55,857
      The food is getting cold.

341
00:15:55,859 --> 00:15:57,124
              Oh, all right.

342
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:02,262
 CEDAR:
 Hold it. I've got
 something else to say.

343
00:16:02,264 --> 00:16:04,197
 This is a new day.

344
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,933
 There is a feeling
 that the predominantly
 black college,

345
00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:10,403
 for all intents and purposes,
 has outlived its usefulness.

346
00:16:10,405 --> 00:16:12,304
   Over the years,
   it has been vital

347
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:14,172
  to our elevation
  in this great country,

348
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:17,942
 but the need no longer exists
 in an integrated society.

349
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,978
           That's absurd.
           It does exist.

350
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:25,549
    It exists at Notre Dame

351
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:29,352
        and Yeshiva, Brandeis,
        at Brigham Young.

352
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:31,554
        Now you tell me,
        what is the difference?

353
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:34,124
 You want to know
 the difference?
 I'll tell you the difference.

354
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,993
 The difference is
 that the Catholics alone
 support the Notre Dames.

355
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:38,594
 The Jews alone
 support the Yeshivas.

356
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:40,529
   Mormons support
   the Brigham Youngs.

357
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:43,331
 Who supports
 the black colleges?
 I'll tell you who.

358
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:48,069
 The federal government
 and philanthropists
 like Snodgrass.

359
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:52,406
 Harold,
 why won't blacks support
 Spelman, Tuskegee,

360
00:16:52,408 --> 00:16:54,141
 Morehouse, Howard?

361
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:56,309
              We do.
 Barely!

362
00:16:56,311 --> 00:16:58,344
 Look,
 as Chairman of the Board,

363
00:16:58,346 --> 00:17:00,646
   I was sent here
   to talk with you.

364
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:04,249
 Now, he does not like
 this divestment mess,
 and I don't like it, either.

365
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:07,051
 Now, you better snip it
 right here at the bud,
 or I will.

366
00:17:07,053 --> 00:17:09,253
 'Cause if you don't,
 you stand a good chance
 of losing them.

367
00:17:09,255 --> 00:17:11,555
               There it is.

368
00:17:11,557 --> 00:17:14,291
 Yeah. People like them
 don't like to be told
 what to do with their money.

369
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:16,592
    Old, old money.

370
00:17:19,763 --> 00:17:22,764
          Shit, I tell you all
          time after time,

371
00:17:22,766 --> 00:17:25,032
         do not sit here again.

372
00:17:25,034 --> 00:17:28,568
         Stay off my bed.
         Stay in your own room.

373
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,770
        Ignorant motherfuckers,
        I swear, man.

374
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:32,638
 Sorry about the bed, homeboy.

375
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,673
 But check this out,
 we got a question
 for you, man.

376
00:17:34,675 --> 00:17:36,775
 What's up
 with your cousin Half-Pint?

377
00:17:36,777 --> 00:17:38,710
   Yo, man, why is he pledging?
                         Oops.

378
00:17:38,712 --> 00:17:42,447
         Yo, man, you wanna
         take your last breath?

379
00:17:42,449 --> 00:17:45,183
             I didn't think so.
             That's my cousin.

380
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:47,451
           You leave him alone.
           You don't talk
           about him like that.

381
00:17:47,453 --> 00:17:48,819
      We understand each other?

382
00:17:48,821 --> 00:17:50,654
    I'm sorry, man.

383
00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:54,157
 But seriously, man,
 what's up with the Pint, man?

384
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:56,058
             But seriously,
             who's going back

385
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,126
 to the administration building
 with me tonight?

386
00:17:58,128 --> 00:18:00,328
   GRADY: Not the kid. Uh-uh.

387
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,596
 Man, you crazy?
 We're going to the coronation.

388
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:04,431
          More butts
          and more titties.

389
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:06,633
           That's right,
           God damn it.

390
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:08,501
  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
  I thought y'all was down
  for the cause.

391
00:18:08,503 --> 00:18:10,135
          Yeah, you my brother,
          but goddamn, man.

392
00:18:10,137 --> 00:18:11,669
        That's right,
        goddamn.

393
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:13,771
    You should
    lighten up on that shit,
    Malcolm, seriously.

394
00:18:13,773 --> 00:18:15,105
        He's right, Nat Turner.

395
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:16,573
           Marcus Garvey.

396
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:18,474
 Frederick Douglass.

397
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:20,742
      Yeah. You all can kiss
      my black ass twice, hear?

398
00:18:20,744 --> 00:18:22,710
      Preach, Jesse. Preach on.

399
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:24,278
          Yo, Farrakhan, relax.

400
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,446
         Don't be so sensitive,
         my man. Chill.

401
00:18:26,448 --> 00:18:29,382
  What about the parade?
  Somebody coming
  to the parade with me, maybe?

402
00:18:29,384 --> 00:18:30,850
            Hey, I'm down, man,
            but not tonight.

403
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:33,252
       I gots to see some
       butts shaking, you know.

404
00:18:33,254 --> 00:18:35,287
      Word up. I'm with him.
      That ain't no joke, man.
      I can't...

405
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:37,455
  What about the rest of y'all?

406
00:18:37,457 --> 00:18:38,722
              Tomorrow.

407
00:18:38,724 --> 00:18:40,690
              All right, bet.
              Enjoy yourselves.

408
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:43,693
              I'll see you all
              tomorrow morning,
              9:00 a.m. sharp.

409
00:18:43,695 --> 00:18:46,595
 That's Kool and the Gang,
 brother.

410
00:18:46,597 --> 00:18:48,296
                     Later.

411
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:50,197
    Jordan, this look familiar?

412
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:51,631
        Looks like your mother.

413
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:53,799
          Yo, yo, my ball, man.
 You don't need it.

414
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:57,402
             Gamma.

415
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,609
 Anybody call me? Perry.

416
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:12,447
                 How you doing?
 How are you?

417
00:19:12,449 --> 00:19:13,681
              You recognize me?

418
00:19:13,683 --> 00:19:15,382
 Yeah, I've seen you on line.

419
00:19:15,384 --> 00:19:17,183
 Aren't you number one?

420
00:19:17,185 --> 00:19:18,551
               Yeah, that's me.
               Half-Pint,

421
00:19:18,553 --> 00:19:20,152
            Gammite number one.

422
00:19:20,154 --> 00:19:21,553

423
00:19:21,555 --> 00:19:23,354
      (CHUCKLING)
      Pleased to meet you.

424
00:19:23,356 --> 00:19:25,155
              Nice to meet you.

425
00:19:25,157 --> 00:19:26,823
     So it's almost
     that time, huh?

426
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:28,624
    Yeah, it'll be any day now.

427
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,425
     Are you excited?

428
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:31,692
                     A little.

429
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:38,164
     So, Half-Pint,
     what can I do for you?

430
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,266
    Well, I was wondering maybe
    if we could see each other,

431
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:41,834
             go out to a movie,
             a restaurant,

432
00:19:41,836 --> 00:19:44,303
             pop some Jiffy Pop
             popcorn together.

433
00:19:44,305 --> 00:19:47,306
    You know,
    enjoy each other's company.
          Yeah, sure.

434
00:19:47,308 --> 00:19:49,508
     That'd be nice.
     That sounds real good.

435
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,444
   Why don't you come by
   after you go over.
   I'm usually in at night.

436
00:19:52,446 --> 00:19:54,813
           I was thinking soon.
           How soon?

437
00:19:54,815 --> 00:19:57,282
            Like now,
            at the Gamma House.
            Sorry.

438
00:19:57,284 --> 00:19:59,317
       I can't.
             We could have fun.
             Big fun.

439
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:01,485
        Just give me one reason
        why not, just one.

440
00:20:01,487 --> 00:20:04,888
    First of all,
    I don't know you from Adam.

441
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,191
  You just pop out of thin air,
  and I'm supposed to say yes?

442
00:20:08,193 --> 00:20:09,825
          I've always been
          attracted to you.

443
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:12,527
         I just couldn't
         tell you before.
         I was shy.

444
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:15,663
        But now that
        I've been pledging,
        I'm a different person.

445
00:20:15,665 --> 00:20:17,531
     Well, I'm not
     attracted to you.

446
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:20,367
       Besides, I don't want
       a physical relationship.

447
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:22,502
        All you guys are dogs.

448
00:20:22,504 --> 00:20:24,470
   I've heard about you Gammas.

449
00:20:24,472 --> 00:20:28,207
     I'm not trying to dog you.
     Look at my face.

450
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:30,943
      Can't a real Gamma man
      be attracted to you, huh?

451
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:33,745
   Is this some type of a joke?

452
00:20:33,747 --> 00:20:36,948
        Did your Big Brother
        send you over here?

453
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,218
          I don't have time
          for children's games.

454
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,221
 And you're so small,
 I'd probably break you in two.

455
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,260
 WOMAN:
 See? See? See?
 I knew it. I knew it.

456
00:20:51,262 --> 00:20:52,928
    That's okay.

457
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,663
                    DINA:
                    <i> Gamma Rays,</i>

458
00:20:54,665 --> 00:20:58,400
            I call to order
            the 35th meeting
            of the Sister Order

459
00:20:58,402 --> 00:21:01,536
      of Gamma Phi Gamma
      Fraternity, Incorporated.

461
00:21:02,872 --> 00:21:04,471
       GAMMA RAYS: Meow.

462
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:05,905
               Kim, could you
               read the minutes

463
00:21:05,907 --> 00:21:07,473
         from the last meeting,
         please?

464
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,274
 All right.
 We decided that Velda

465
00:21:09,276 --> 00:21:11,476
 will take care of the music
 for the fashion show.

466
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,846
 Velda, please, none of that
 hip-hop, B-boys nonsense.

467
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:15,980
  GAMMA RAYS: Yeah.

468
00:21:15,982 --> 00:21:18,315
    I happen to like Run-DMC.

469
00:21:18,317 --> 00:21:20,650
 Nevertheless,
 leave it at home.

470
00:21:20,652 --> 00:21:22,985
 Miriam,
 did you call the boutiques?

471
00:21:22,987 --> 00:21:24,753
                    Yes, I did.

472
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:26,855
 Did you make
 a list of the suppliers?
                    Yes, I did.

473
00:21:26,857 --> 00:21:28,423
 She is such
 a pain in the ass.

474
00:21:28,425 --> 00:21:29,824
          Look. Let's not
          make this long, okay?

475
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:31,292
        We have to get dressed.

476
00:21:31,294 --> 00:21:32,726
      Now what have we decided?

477
00:21:32,728 --> 00:21:34,728
 Okay. I talked to the Brothers

478
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,663
      and the Gammites
      are definitely going over
      tomorrow night.

479
00:21:36,665 --> 00:21:37,830
 GAMMA RAYS: All right.

480
00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:39,531
             So we should
             give them a party.

481
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:41,466
        ALL: Yes.

482
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:44,669
 They haven't
 had fun for so long,
 a jam will be on.

483
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:46,237
      Where, at the frat house?

484
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,504
 Yeah, at the Gamma House.

485
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,838
 The brothers
 said it was cool,

486
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,272
 but we have to
 clean up first.

487
00:21:50,274 --> 00:21:51,473
              MIRIAM: Clean up?

488
00:21:51,475 --> 00:21:52,640
                 Are you crazy?

489
00:21:52,642 --> 00:21:53,974
       Look,
       we have been cleaning up

490
00:21:53,976 --> 00:21:56,710
             after those sorry,
             tired, trifling,

            from day one.

492
00:21:58,747 --> 00:22:01,681
      And I am not cleaning up.
      I refuse to clean.

493
00:22:01,683 --> 00:22:04,250
            Miriam, why are you
            always complaining?

494
00:22:04,252 --> 00:22:05,884
           This is for G-Phi-G.

495
00:22:05,886 --> 00:22:07,385
 For the black and silver.

496
00:22:07,387 --> 00:22:08,986
                 Yet and still,
                 I am no maid.

497
00:22:08,988 --> 00:22:10,921
  And we are?
 TASHA:
 Well, I have a question.

498
00:22:10,923 --> 00:22:12,522
 Who's gonna pay
 for it this time?

499
00:22:12,524 --> 00:22:14,524
          We're giving it,
          we should pay for it.

500
00:22:14,526 --> 00:22:16,526
          GAMMA RAY:
          We always pay for it.
 Common sense.

501
00:22:16,528 --> 00:22:18,394
       We are gonna pay for it.

502
00:22:18,396 --> 00:22:20,929
           Now, Dina,
           how much did we make
           from the bake sale?

503
00:22:22,465 --> 00:22:23,864
      Enough.

504
00:22:23,866 --> 00:22:25,799
                  I'm not going
                  to the party.

512
00:22:55,826 --> 00:22:56,925
                 I'm coming up.

    You got to go back out
    and bring in a freak.

                    Two freaks.

 Put it in a cage
 and mark it "Pussy."

671
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:12,314
 DR. FEELGOOD: Now, I motion
 for the death penalty.

672
00:32:12,316 --> 00:32:14,082
                  That'll work.

00:32:14,084 --> 00:32:17,018
 The Chair, having

         for these offenders
         of the law.

 Yes, sir.

                       Right.

683
00:32:36,568 --> 00:32:39,068
        See, we're gonna
        have to make a decision

684
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:42,905
       between the gas chamber,
       the electric chair,

      That's right.
      Yeah. That's right.

  Isn't she on the Gamma court?

717

  Not only is she on the court,

      If we don't leave now,

      a seat at the coronation.

 That's right, Rachel.
 Let's go.
 You can study later.

725
00:34:24,253 --> 00:34:28,755
           Rachel, you haven't
           seen anybody else
           since freshman year.

726
00:34:28,757 --> 00:34:31,324
        Don't you ever feel
        like seeing other guys,

727
00:34:31,326 --> 00:34:33,326
           like having
           other relationships?

728
00:34:33,328 --> 00:34:34,794
                  No.
 Yes, you do, Rachel.

00:34:34,796 --> 00:34:36,295
          No, I don't.

      Come on.
      Listen, Dap's a good guy.

731
00:34:38,465 --> 00:34:40,565
                    I like him.

00:34:46,104 --> 00:34:48,270
                 he's snaking.

736
00:34:48,272 --> 00:34:49,704
     Ooh.

737
00:34:49,706 --> 00:34:52,073
              He can't help it.

738
00:34:52,075 --> 00:34:53,741
                    He's a man.

739
00:34:53,743 --> 00:34:55,843
             It's their nature.
             Mmm-mmm.

740
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:58,578
                Are you coming
                or not, Rachel?

741
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,346
       No, I'm not going.

742

 Oh, come on, Doris.

 She put the "T" in tired.

 And that's all
 somebody would have to do

746
00:35:08,187 --> 00:35:11,188
 to get a bus
 and put a sign on it
 that says, uh,

747
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,323
 "All the fried chicken
 you want."

748
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:16,459
 And you know black folks
 would be on that bus
 in a hurry.

749
00:35:16,461 --> 00:35:18,794
 Or, "All the drugs you want."

00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:09,451
        We had static with Jane
        and the Gamma Rays.

843
00:41:09,453 --> 00:41:12,620

 not to let Julian bother me.

 with you and Jane, huh?

               The usual.
       Well, fuck 'em.

847
00:41:17,993 --> 00:41:20,159
 I don't give
 two motherfucks about them.
 So I don't see...

00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:21,994
               Here we go.
   Here we go, where?

849
00:41:21,996 --> 00:41:23,662
        Don't start, all right?

850
00:41:23,664 --> 00:41:25,830
 What are you talking about,
 "Don't start"?

851
00:41:25,832 --> 00:41:27,898
   I know I have
   my problems with them,
   but with you it's a crusade.

852
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,766
         I'm beginning to think
         you're color-struck.

853
00:41:29,768 --> 00:41:33,503
  You definitely have a thing
  against light-skinned blacks.

00:41:33,505 --> 00:41:35,905
      Who, me?
           Yes, you.

00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:38,908
 No, no, Rachel.
 It's them. It's not me.

856
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:44,546
 Come on, I adore octoroon
 and quadroon mulattoes.
 They're so unpure.

857
00:41:44,548 --> 00:41:46,781
          And you're 100% pure?

858
00:41:46,783 --> 00:41:50,651
      Massa was in your
      ancestors' slave quarters
      just like everybody else.

00:41:50,653 --> 00:41:52,786
 No, no, no, no.

       The rest suck.

 If people are cool with me,
 Rachel, I'm cool with them.

867

           You're full of shit.

868

00:46:04,798 --> 00:46:07,732
           I'm going to pledge

910
00:46:07,734 --> 00:46:09,133
            I've been to
            a couple of rushes,

911
00:46:09,135 --> 00:46:11,902
         and if they accept me,
         I'm gonna do it.

 First it was Julian,

 Everybody tripping or what?
 What is this?

914
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,041
 I don't believe this, Rachel.

915
00:46:19,043 --> 00:46:21,276
                 Believe it.

     You sure know how to spoil
     a pleasant evening.

917
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,913
 I know how to spoil
 a pleasant evening?

918
00:46:25,915 --> 00:46:28,282
 I didn't come in here
 talking about pledging
 no sorority.

919
00:46:28,284 --> 00:46:29,916
               I must have been
               sick in the head

920
00:46:29,918 --> 00:46:31,284
         to think
         I'd have your support.

921
00:46:31,286 --> 00:46:33,519
 Yeah, you must have been
 sick in the head,

922
00:46:33,521 --> 00:46:36,755
 'cause you ain't
 getting my support
 on nothing like that. No way.

923
00:46:36,757 --> 00:46:38,156
            Thought I would.

924
00:46:38,158 --> 00:46:40,458
  Yeah, well...

925
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:44,061
 You know them
 sororities are just as bad
 as fraternities, Rachel.

926
00:46:44,063 --> 00:46:47,164
      Vaughn, this is something
      that I want to do.

927
00:46:47,166 --> 00:46:49,332
         You have every right
         not to like the Greeks

928
00:46:49,334 --> 00:46:51,367
    but this is another matter.
 Now that's bullshit.

929
00:46:51,369 --> 00:46:53,102
     You haven't even
     considered the good things

930

 you've been a good student
 these past four years

1126
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:37,886
 and you've grown
 into a fine young man.

 You've become
 a disruptive force
 on this campus.

1131
00:58:48,196 --> 00:58:51,997
 You're hindering other folks
 from an education.

          Let me make it plain.

          really have a choice.

1139
00:59:13,484 --> 00:59:15,550
       With all due respect,
       President McPherson,

1140
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,219
       I don't believe
       this man knows
       the meaning of the word.

1141
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:22,122
      So what?
      You marched with King
      in the '60s. Big deal.

1146
00:59:32,132 --> 00:59:35,266
              Says who?

1147
00:59:35,268 --> 00:59:39,703
      There is no way
      you can defend
      not divesting completely.

1148
00:59:39,705 --> 00:59:41,838
          No ifs, ands
          or buts about it.

1149
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,940
              It's your program
              we don't like.

1150
00:59:43,942 --> 00:59:48,277

 hinder other students
 from getting an education.

1151
00:59:48,279 --> 00:59:49,645
     I'll do what I have to do.

1152

                     So will I.

               of living to do.

1155
01:00:00,689 --> 01:00:04,057
               I had classmates
               here at Mission
               just like you.

1156
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:06,893
        And now
        they're old and bitter.

    do you?

1166
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:52,765
         No, we didn't.

 Yeah.

1185
01:01:33,263 --> 01:01:36,030
 Did I just hear that
 you're going to pledge?

1186
01:01:36,032 --> 01:01:38,132
 Thanks for telling us.
 It's a big surprise.

1187

           We don't have any
           white meat today.

1325
01:07:09,287 --> 01:07:11,320
 Then why did you ask?

1326
01:07:11,322 --> 01:07:14,089
 So, Monroe,
 I'll give you that $30 back
 next week, man.

1327
01:07:14,091 --> 01:07:16,391
                   Yeah, right.

1328
01:07:16,393 --> 01:07:19,093
 Book,
 you got any salt down there?

1329
01:07:20,262 --> 01:07:21,661
           All right.

1330
01:07:24,365 --> 01:07:26,164
                   (CHATTERING)

1331
01:07:28,535 --> 01:07:32,470
 Excuse me, brothers.
 Think I can borrow
 the salt from y'all?

1332
01:07:32,472 --> 01:07:35,005
        We ain't finished.
        So I said to the bitch,

1333
01:07:35,007 --> 01:07:37,507
    "Look, you don't come to me
    with no shit like that."

1334
01:07:37,509 --> 01:07:40,042
 So when do you think
 you'll be finished?

1335
01:07:42,646 --> 01:07:44,379
             What time it is?

1336
01:07:44,381 --> 01:07:45,713
             (ALL LAUGHING)

1337
01:07:48,184 --> 01:07:49,750
         Later for them, man.

1338
01:07:49,752 --> 01:07:51,351
            I ain't thinking
            about them suckers.

1339
01:07:51,353 --> 01:07:52,618
                       LEEDS:
                       Yoo-hoo.

1340
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:54,686
            Look, don't start
            no shit, all right?

1341
01:07:54,688 --> 01:07:56,220
              Just let them go.

1342
01:07:56,222 --> 01:07:57,688
            Yoo-hoo. Over here.

1343
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:59,690
   What? What do you want, man?

1344
01:07:59,692 --> 01:08:02,592
     Do you boys go to Mission?
                          Yeah.

1345
01:08:02,594 --> 01:08:07,196
       Is it true what they say
       about Mission men?

1346
01:08:07,198 --> 01:08:09,531
           Hey, Grady, man, no.
           Let's go.

1347
01:08:09,533 --> 01:08:12,066
   Hey, yo, fuck them.
   We've already paid
   the money for this...

1348
01:08:12,068 --> 01:08:14,101
      Yeah, yeah. I know it.
      Let's go. Come on.

1349
01:08:14,103 --> 01:08:17,037
 No, man.
 I ain't finished eating
 my chicken yet, man.

1350
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:20,006
    Hey, yo, why we gotta...
     For them suckers, man?

1351
01:08:20,008 --> 01:08:22,274
              EDGE:
              Yo, Dap, hold up!
              Yo, Dap, man!

1352
01:08:22,276 --> 01:08:24,376
   Yo, Dap, chill for a minute.
 Squash it, Edge.

1353
01:08:24,378 --> 01:08:26,311
    Hey, yo, Dap, come on, man.
    Don't do that.

1354
01:08:26,313 --> 01:08:28,012
 Squash it.

1355
01:08:28,014 --> 01:08:29,646
              Yo, Missionaries.
    The jheri curl
    is popping shit.

1356

                  Missionettes.

1357
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:33,115
 Ready-for-the-world
 is popping shit.

1358
01:08:33,117 --> 01:08:35,317
 Come on. Man,
 what's up with that?

1359
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:38,586
     Yeah, brother.
     What do you want?

1360
01:08:38,588 --> 01:08:40,154
        You ain't no kin to me.

1361
01:08:40,156 --> 01:08:42,289
    That's right,
    and we ain't your brothers.

1362
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:44,658
  How come you
  college motherfuckers
  think you all run everything?

1363
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:47,127
 Is there a problem here?
             Big problems.

1364
01:08:47,129 --> 01:08:48,795
            I heard that.

1365
01:08:48,797 --> 01:08:51,430
           You come to our town
           year after year
           and take over.

1366
01:08:51,432 --> 01:08:54,499
          We was born here,
          gonna be here
          and gonna die here

1367
01:08:54,501 --> 01:08:56,701
            and can't find jobs
            'cause of you.

1368
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:58,502
    (STAMMERING)
    Yeah. Right.
    Now can we go?

1369
01:08:58,504 --> 01:08:59,803
  Okay, can we just go?

1370
01:08:59,805 --> 01:09:02,305
           I mean, we may not
           have your education,

1371
01:09:02,307 --> 01:09:03,806
           but we ain't dirt,
           neither.

1372
01:09:03,808 --> 01:09:05,674
  And ain't nobody said
  all of that, all right?

1373
01:09:05,676 --> 01:09:07,776
            You Mission punks
            are always
            talking down to us.

1374
01:09:07,778 --> 01:09:10,478
 Look, Brother,
 I'm real sorry that
 you feel that way, okay?

1375
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,213
 I'm really sorry about that.

1376
01:09:12,215 --> 01:09:14,615
              Are you black?
     Take a look in the mirror,
     man.

1377
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:17,351
 Look, you got
 a legitimate beef, all right,
 but it ain't with us, okay?

1378
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:19,419
               Are you black?

1379
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:21,487
 Look, man,
 don't ever question the fact
 whether I'm black.

1380
01:09:21,489 --> 01:09:24,457
 In fact, I was going to ask
 your country-bama ass

1381
01:09:24,459 --> 01:09:26,892
        why you got them
        drip-drip chemicals
        in your hair.

1382
01:09:26,894 --> 01:09:28,894
 That's right,
 God damn it.

1383
01:09:28,896 --> 01:09:31,529
   And then come out in public
   with a shower cap
   on your head.

1384
01:09:31,531 --> 01:09:33,230
          Like a fucking bitch.

1385
01:09:33,232 --> 01:09:34,664
       MOSES:
       Who you calling a bitch,
       bitch?

1386
01:09:34,666 --> 01:09:36,399
       Well, if the shoe fit...

1387
01:09:36,401 --> 01:09:38,667
    You know, I bet you niggers
    do think y'all are white.

1388
01:09:38,669 --> 01:09:40,735
       College don't mean shit.

1389
01:09:40,737 --> 01:09:45,206
            Y'all are niggers,
            and you going to
            be niggers forever.

1390
01:09:45,208 --> 01:09:47,675
               Just like us.
                 Niggers.

1391
01:09:52,648 --> 01:09:55,548
 You're not niggers.

1392
01:10:02,756 --> 01:10:04,922
          Come on, man.

1393
01:10:04,924 --> 01:10:07,891
              Fuck you up.

1394
01:10:07,893 --> 01:10:10,560
     Get the fuck out of here
     before I bust a cap
     in your young college ass.

1395
01:10:10,562 --> 01:10:11,794
                  Go on.

1396
01:10:15,766 --> 01:10:17,832
       Wait, wait a minute.
       You know what?

1397
01:10:17,834 --> 01:10:20,234
     (STAMMERING)
     I don't really
     want to believe that,

1398
01:10:20,236 --> 01:10:22,369
      I mean, but do we really
      act like that?

1399
01:10:22,371 --> 01:10:24,771
    My name's Bennett.
    I ain't even in it.

1400
01:10:24,773 --> 01:10:28,241
 (STAMMERING)
 No, no, but you know, what
 the guys were saying about us.

1401
01:10:28,243 --> 01:10:30,776
           That my name's Paul,
           and that's just
           between y'all.

1402
01:10:30,778 --> 01:10:32,377
 Yo, man,
 we're not wannabes.

1403
01:10:32,379 --> 01:10:33,845
            They were ignorant.

1404
01:10:33,847 --> 01:10:36,247
       I don't know, guys.
       I don't think so.

1405
01:10:36,249 --> 01:10:38,582
     Look, man,
     motherfuckers got to start

1406
01:10:38,584 --> 01:10:40,784
            and try and better
            theirself, man,

1407
01:10:40,786 --> 01:10:43,286
  just like we're trying to do.
   Dig it.

1408
01:10:43,288 --> 01:10:45,588
     (STAMMERING)
     Maybe they've tried it,
     and they've just given up.

1409
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:47,656
 Yeah, that's the deal, man.

1410
01:10:47,658 --> 01:10:49,557
 You think
 everything's so damn easy,
 don't you, Grady?

1411
01:10:49,559 --> 01:10:51,926
        Hell, yeah.
        You work or you starve.

1412
01:10:51,928 --> 01:10:53,727
         I want to eat sirloin.

1413
01:10:53,729 --> 01:10:55,729
 Then the guy
 was right, man.

1414
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:57,731
      I know the guy was right.
      I told you.

1415
01:10:57,733 --> 01:10:59,799
               What do he know?
     He knows a lot.

1416
01:10:59,801 --> 01:11:02,434
    So, like,
    do you think that maybe
    you could drive any faster?

1417
01:11:02,436 --> 01:11:03,835
       I'm going to be late
       for glee club.

1418
01:11:03,837 --> 01:11:05,269
 "I'm going to be late
 for glee club."

1419
01:11:05,271 --> 01:11:06,403
        See, you guys are
        like picking on me.

1420
01:11:06,405 --> 01:11:07,904
             ALL: No!

1421
01:11:07,906 --> 01:11:10,706
 No man, you our boy, man.

1422
01:11:10,708 --> 01:11:12,340
    (CHATTERING)

1423
01:11:15,611 --> 01:11:17,310
                   Hey, baby.
        Hey, baby.

1424
01:11:17,312 --> 01:11:18,577
                  Hey, baby.
         Hey, baby.

1425
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:20,478
 She's got a beard,
 motherfucker.

1426
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,513
 She looks just like your mama
 and shit, man.

1427
01:11:22,515 --> 01:11:24,848
       At least my mama
       ain't got no beard
       on the back of her neck.

1428
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:27,383
  Your mama got two titties
  on the back of her neck
  and shit.

1429
01:11:27,385 --> 01:11:28,751
         Yo, Jordan, Jordan.
         What?

1430
01:11:28,753 --> 01:11:31,019
       I heard your mom held
       Kareem to 15 points.

1431
01:11:31,021 --> 01:11:32,487
           (LAUGHING)

1432
01:11:32,489 --> 01:11:33,988
   The newspaper said
   your mama playing

1433
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:35,889
 fullback for the Hefty Hos
 and shit.

1434
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:37,657
  That's all right, man.
  At least she's starting, man.

1435
01:11:37,659 --> 01:11:39,525
         Your mama
         coming off the bench.

1436
01:11:39,527 --> 01:11:41,527
   That's right.
       She's a four-letter man.

1437
01:11:41,529 --> 01:11:42,794
     Oh, shut up.

1438
01:11:42,796 --> 01:11:44,662
     Your head can be
     used like a knife.

1439
01:11:44,664 --> 01:11:46,597
 Shut up.
         Ginsu II.

1440
01:11:46,599 --> 01:11:49,800
     Yo, when Booker comes,
     he's gotta come twice

1441
01:11:49,802 --> 01:11:52,936
     'cause his back of
     his head is thick enough
     for two people.

1442
01:11:52,938 --> 01:11:55,605
    So, anyway, Booker,
    look, man...

1443
01:11:55,607 --> 01:11:56,973
 Wait a minute.
 There's Julian.

1444
01:11:56,975 --> 01:11:58,808
 JORDAN:
 That shit wasn't funny, man.

1445
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:00,743
     BOOKER T:
     So what, man?
     I ain't stopping, man.

1446
01:12:00,745 --> 01:12:02,411
 No. You are stopping,
 'cause I've gotta talk to him.

1447
01:12:02,413 --> 01:12:03,612
         (CHATTERING)
 Pull over, Book.

1448
01:12:08,585 --> 01:12:10,384
