1
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:14,593
My father said it won't last long.
He said we'll take care of them.

2
00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:19,726
Sit down!

3
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:30,775
TO KILL A PRIEST

4
00:04:31,744 --> 00:04:35,506
The year 1981, for Poland,
was the year of Solidarity.

5
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:39,860
A free popular movement was born,
and it carried the hopes of millions of Poles.

6
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:44,694
The growth of Solidarity was so overwhelming,

7
00:04:44,695 --> 00:04:48,685
people felt that nothing
could ever stand in its path.

8
00:04:55,831 --> 00:04:59,212
WARSAW, December 12th 1981.

9
00:05:13,718 --> 00:05:15,174
Help!

10
00:05:16,197 --> 00:05:18,314
They're after Solidarity!

11
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:23,262
It's the militia!

12
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,696
They're arresting Solidarity!

13
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:50,082
Looks like they're gonna shoot us.

14
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:32,127
- Murderers!
- Get back.

15
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,259
- What's going on?
- This is a state of war!

16
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:30,441
Hands off me!

17
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,714
Bastards! Leave me alone!

18
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,198
Get on. You're under arrest.

19
00:08:03,512 --> 00:08:06,409
You hit me with some of that
and I'll have your ass!

20
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,568
Get them in the truck
and leave the guards here.

21
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:10,033
- Yes, sir.
- Good job.

22
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:12,743
Good night, sir.

23
00:08:14,835 --> 00:08:16,537
Ready to go.

24
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,823
Take me home.

25
00:08:49,606 --> 00:08:51,885
- Stefan?
- Yes.

26
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:19,065
I'm freezing.

27
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,882
What is this?

28
00:09:55,713 --> 00:09:56,998
What are you doing awake?

29
00:09:56,498 --> 00:09:59,446
Don't want to miss too many cartoons.

30
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:02,306
Do you know what this is for?

31
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,007
Mom's afraid.

32
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:08,115
Of what?

33
00:10:08,636 --> 00:10:10,717
- That they'll come.
- Who?

34
00:10:10,718 --> 00:10:12,501
The Solidarity people.

35
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,904
No one's going to come.

36
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:25,968
And, you can sleep late in the morning,
because there won't be any cartoons on TV.

37
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,195
Why?

38
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:31,146
They'll have something
more important to talk about.

39
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,620
That's it, come on, right,
good, good, keep coming!

40
00:10:49,158 --> 00:10:51,988
That's it! Give me more of that swing!

41
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:54,083
And remember your right.

42
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:55,615
Josef!

43
00:10:56,917 --> 00:11:00,439
Josef! Show him
how to keep up his guard.

44
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:13,755
Good... Come on, come on...

45
00:11:23,894 --> 00:11:26,836
What are you doing?
What's this, what's this?

46
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:30,720
Watch your right,
keep up your guard!

47
00:11:48,326 --> 00:11:49,955
That's it?

48
00:12:03,608 --> 00:12:07,426
I'm really sorry, father.
I didn't even recognize you.

49
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:09,283
That's ok.

50
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,691
We met during the strike?

51
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:17,169
Are you Anna's husband?

52
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:20,880
She didn't want to get married in church.

53
00:12:21,351 --> 00:12:24,312
- She's been arrested.
- When?

54
00:12:24,313 --> 00:12:27,790
The first night.
She drove right into a militia raid.

55
00:12:28,462 --> 00:12:30,548
With a bunch of Christmas trees.

56
00:12:34,877 --> 00:12:37,858
Well, what are you doing here?

57
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:43,360
I wanted to see what it was like
to be punched in the face.

58
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:46,745
Well, now you know.

59
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,727
Let's go!
Feliks, please, let's go.

60
00:13:02,671 --> 00:13:03,657
I caught you.

61
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:07,909
Stop talking about your boyfriends,
we've got a job to do.

62
00:13:12,196 --> 00:13:13,608
St. Martin's church.

63
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:14,609
You live nearby.

64
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:16,457
- Do they know you over there?
- No.

65
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:19,603
They're collecting
medical supplies and clothes

66
00:13:19,604 --> 00:13:23,415
for the people
who've been ... arrested.

67
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:27,121
Maybe you should bring a sweater
or an old jacket, something to give away.

68
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:29,029
- Can I have a car?
- Why?

69
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,425
You want to impress
your mother-in-law again?

70
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:36,971
Vizitki church.

71
00:13:37,064 --> 00:13:39,640
- A lot of young students there.
- How do you know?

72
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:42,370
Well, I checked it out, I thought
you might give me this one.

73
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:44,558
Did you go there with your
Solidarity friends?

74
00:13:48,974 --> 00:13:51,156
That you could get involved
with these people...

75
00:13:52,703 --> 00:13:56,199
Well, there are a lot of pretty boys in Solidarity.

76
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,811
St. Sebastian's church.

77
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:08,277
This one ... I take care of myself.

78
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:11,476
That's the one with the young priest.
Father Alek.

79
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,512
Hey, Feliks, he's a good-looking man...

80
00:14:17,577 --> 00:14:18,572
That's it.

81
00:14:25,592 --> 00:14:32,698
On the night of December 12th,
the government imposed the state of war.

82
00:14:34,352 --> 00:14:37,593
They arrested thousands of people.

83
00:14:41,075 --> 00:14:47,623
Some died. Others are in hiding,
hunted like common criminals.

84
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:54,276
A government by brute force
is not a government.

85
00:14:55,422 --> 00:15:01,774
It is tyranny, a deception,
and a blasphemy.

86
00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:07,128
They have forced silence upon us.

87
00:15:08,376 --> 00:15:12,681
But that silence is going to speak
for our brothers and sisters in prison.

88
00:15:14,138 --> 00:15:18,118
That silence is going to speak
for our sense of decency.

89
00:15:19,963 --> 00:15:24,231
That silence is going to speak
for our freedom of speech.

90
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,964
Let us pray.

91
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:26,271
- Holy mother of the imprisoned.
- Pray for us!

92
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:31,213
- Holy mother of the deceived.
- Pray for us!

93
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:36,260
- Holy mother of the betrayed.
- Pray for us!

94
00:16:36,576 --> 00:16:40,896
- Holy mother of the captured at night.
- Pray for us!

95
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:45,149
Holy mother of the miners who were shot.

96
00:16:45,156 --> 00:16:47,145
Pray for us!

97
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:50,180
Mother of suffering Poland.

98
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:53,371
Mother of independent Poland.

99
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:56,660
Mother of ever-faithful Poland.

100
00:16:57,277 --> 00:17:00,806
Pray for us!

101
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:48,889
How's the video?

102
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:53,145
Drove me mad yesterday,
but today it works like a charm.

103
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,214
Good.

104
00:19:07,318 --> 00:19:09,212
I hate crowds.

105
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:11,371
The body of Christ.

106
00:19:13,727 --> 00:19:15,392
The body of Christ.

107
00:19:19,877 --> 00:19:24,006
- I want you to baptize me.
- Did they beat you?

108
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:26,809
Anna!

109
00:19:41,783 --> 00:19:45,949
These demonstrations always start
in a church, and end in a church.

110
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:49,845
What exactly is your function, captain?

111
00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:51,508
I head the fourth department.

112
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:55,019
We're responsible for monitoring
religious activities, comrade colonel.

113
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:57,455
Yes, of course, I spoke to the minister.

114
00:19:58,112 --> 00:20:00,741
He's not entirely happy with your efforts.

115
00:20:01,444 --> 00:20:05,716
These priests are inciting
thousands of people to rebellion.

116
00:20:07,144 --> 00:20:10,118
What do you do about it, captain?

117
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:12,870
Nothing, captain?

118
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,085
Nothing!

119
00:20:22,141 --> 00:20:24,036
Is that you?

120
00:20:25,468 --> 00:20:26,394
Yes.

121
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:04,914
I had to...
I was in the midst of...

122
00:21:06,322 --> 00:21:08,750
You have to pray and cross yourself... you know.

123
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,474
Show me how you cross yourself.

124
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:28,490
Come on...

125
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:32,100
- In the name of the father...
- In the name of the father...

126
00:21:32,673 --> 00:21:34,294
- Right hand.
- Right hand.

127
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,886
- Even if you're left-handed.
- Yes.

128
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:39,302
- In the name of the father...
- In the name of the father...

129
00:21:39,303 --> 00:21:40,505
- The son...
- The son...

130
00:21:40,505 --> 00:21:42,154
- And the holy ghost...
- And the holy ghost...

131
00:21:42,154 --> 00:21:43,343
Amen.

132
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:48,591
- Amen.
- That's correct.

133
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:55,031
He's a very dangerous man.
He's very charismatic.

134
00:21:55,576 --> 00:21:59,198
The more the people listen to him, they believe him.
They're ready to follow him.

135
00:21:59,744 --> 00:22:01,592
They're stupid and backward.

136
00:22:05,163 --> 00:22:09,495
- You're ready to follow him?
- You're joking.

137
00:22:10,164 --> 00:22:11,574
Of course.

138
00:22:27,621 --> 00:22:29,255
Son of a bitch.

139
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:39,788
Mirek...

140
00:23:49,104 --> 00:23:50,964
Dammit...

141
00:23:51,905 --> 00:23:56,032
Let them be afraid...
Let them be afraid.

142
00:23:57,744 --> 00:24:02,815
You see...
They draw gallows on our door.

143
00:24:22,984 --> 00:24:24,626
Even the cops couldn't put up with her.

144
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:28,108
I bet she gave them a hard time.

145
00:24:41,382 --> 00:24:43,944
- What are you doing?
- The creche.

146
00:24:44,098 --> 00:24:49,767
This is not a creche!
This is not Christ's creche!

147
00:24:53,645 --> 00:24:57,060
You have no right to put
a whole parrish in danger.

148
00:24:56,957 --> 00:24:58,514
Help me take this away.

149
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,255
It'd be a sacrilege to step on baby Jesus.

150
00:25:09,829 --> 00:25:14,098
There's no reason to laugh.
They've come for you.

151
00:25:15,997 --> 00:25:18,868
They're waiting for you
outside the church.

152
00:25:31,286 --> 00:25:34,056
- Where are you taking him?
- We can't tell you.

153
00:25:35,248 --> 00:25:36,640
I'm sorry, father.

154
00:26:00,683 --> 00:26:04,006
Father, we've brought you here
for a confession.

155
00:26:04,007 --> 00:26:05,700
I've nothing to confess.

156
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:09,417
- A soldier's confession.
- In the middle of the night?

157
00:26:09,872 --> 00:26:11,272
He'll be executed at dawn.

158
00:26:11,997 --> 00:26:16,415
- He asked for you specifically.
- I will pray for you.

159
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:19,221
You can't talk about any of this.

160
00:27:26,214 --> 00:27:27,862
What happened?

161
00:27:30,764 --> 00:27:32,683
Disobeyed orders?

162
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,274
- The order to shoot.
- I did shoot.

163
00:27:40,234 --> 00:27:44,737
At my commanding officer. I missed.
Because of my hands.

164
00:27:45,396 --> 00:27:48,483
We should thank God for not letting you kill.

165
00:27:48,855 --> 00:27:51,222
They ordered us to shoot factory workers!

166
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:56,733
If everyone had done the same as me,
we would have won.

167
00:27:56,768 --> 00:28:02,309
Winning is not important. What's important
is that we're in the right.

168
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:04,230
It's easy for you to say.

169
00:28:05,027 --> 00:28:07,294
I'm the one that's going to die.

170
00:28:08,348 --> 00:28:10,811
All you know how to do is pray.

171
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:17,229
That's right.

172
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:25,491
You know, father, that's just for cowards!

173
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:30,080
You knew we couldn't win!
You betrayed us!

174
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:37,783
To be right is not enough.

175
00:28:49,095 --> 00:28:51,648
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.

176
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:06,275
What are you sins?

177
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:09,426
The sin of impurity.

178
00:29:10,552 --> 00:29:12,290
Christ!

179
00:29:12,982 --> 00:29:16,825
- Is that bad?
- No, no. Of course not.

180
00:29:19,017 --> 00:29:20,697
I stole...

181
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:25,556
Two bags of cement, from work.

182
00:29:26,707 --> 00:29:28,909
My dad was building a house and...

183
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:32,736
You have to go now.

184
00:30:49,004 --> 00:30:52,385
Good dog. You thought I deserted you?

185
00:30:54,128 --> 00:30:55,453
Spike!

186
00:31:01,356 --> 00:31:03,128
Spike! Come on!

187
00:31:09,443 --> 00:31:10,687
Goddamned animal!

188
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:22,252
- What are you doing here?
- Mom's upset.

189
00:31:22,945 --> 00:31:24,133
She went to find you.

190
00:31:26,872 --> 00:31:28,388
What for?

191
00:31:42,675 --> 00:31:44,460
I'm waiting for you.

192
00:31:54,477 --> 00:31:57,593
- You want me to stay with you?
- Tell me a story.

193
00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:03,059
Once upon a time there was
a young man named Mirek.

194
00:32:04,158 --> 00:32:09,870
- One day, his father decided to get him a dog.
- Really?

195
00:32:10,236 --> 00:32:11,974
Yes. Really.

196
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,704
- We'll call him...
- Buck!

197
00:32:13,704 --> 00:32:17,076
A boy in my class has got a dog,
he says, "I've got a Buck."

198
00:32:17,425 --> 00:32:19,020
Let's call him Pope.

199
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:23,189
Come Pope, lay down!
Pope, go get the paper!

200
00:32:24,097 --> 00:32:25,215
Mom?

201
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:31,075
Dad's going to buy me a dog, you know
what we're going to call him?

202
00:32:35,812 --> 00:32:37,555
Let me talk to your mom.

203
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,978
Halina, open the door!

204
00:32:40,095 --> 00:32:43,570
- Go back wherever you came from.
- I was at work - You liar!

205
00:32:43,812 --> 00:32:46,205
I went to your office
and they told me you were off duty.

206
00:32:46,205 --> 00:32:48,131
Who did you spend the night with last night?

207
00:32:48,131 --> 00:32:49,334
I was at work!

208
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:53,143
You left the kid by himself,
now open the goddamn door!

209
00:32:53,143 --> 00:32:58,572
You disgust me! We don't need you!
We're better off without you!

210
00:33:00,238 --> 00:33:01,627
Fine!

211
00:33:16,998 --> 00:33:20,544
I was working. You understand working?

212
00:33:21,877 --> 00:33:26,580
- Where were you?
- I can't tell you that.

213
00:33:29,715 --> 00:33:32,645
I'm terrified that they're going to kill you.

214
00:33:39,335 --> 00:33:44,520
Why can't you just lock them up?
Deport them, get rid of them!

215
00:33:45,672 --> 00:33:47,868
Can't you do something?

216
00:33:53,128 --> 00:33:55,394
- May I have a dog, mom...
- Shut up!

217
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,238
I'll get you a goddamn dog.

218
00:34:06,372 --> 00:34:09,630
- Kid wants a dog.
- Why not.

219
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:16,226
You haven't even touched me
since this whole thing started.

220
00:34:16,435 --> 00:34:18,516
Since what started?

221
00:34:37,404 --> 00:34:39,013
What's that?

222
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:42,016
What's that?

223
00:34:50,248 --> 00:34:53,807
- Does he fuck her?
- I wish. She'd like to fuck him.

224
00:34:54,566 --> 00:34:57,696
That's her husband.
They're in the priest's apartment.

225
00:34:57,697 --> 00:34:58,833
His aunt left it to him.

226
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,190
That's his dog.

227
00:35:04,377 --> 00:35:07,267
Whenever there's a political trial,
he has to be there.

228
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,492
We're like the untouchables, aren't we?

229
00:35:10,492 --> 00:35:13,076
If we had the FBI's money,
and the KGB's independence,

230
00:35:13,076 --> 00:35:14,746
nobody could stop us.

231
00:35:16,368 --> 00:35:17,876
- He's a boxer?
- He's learning.

232
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:21,759
It's not that funny,
pretty soon they'll learn to shoot.

233
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,296
Doesn't look like he could punch anybody.

234
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:28,359
In South America,
priests smuggle guns under their robes.

235
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:31,928
He only looks like an angel.

236
00:35:40,149 --> 00:35:41,788
Son of a bitch.

237
00:35:48,304 --> 00:35:52,258
This is the full plan of the church,
and the presbytery.

238
00:35:54,364 --> 00:35:56,145
This is his apartment.

239
00:36:05,426 --> 00:36:08,535
We should try to get you a job
at the UN mission in New York.

240
00:36:08,535 --> 00:36:10,603
Really? Do you think they'd send me?

241
00:36:10,603 --> 00:36:14,894
If I remember correctly, you tried to start
a Solidarity movement in the militia.

242
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:20,542
Somehow I don't think
they're going to forget that.

243
00:36:22,424 --> 00:36:24,276
You stood up for me?

244
00:36:26,221 --> 00:36:28,322
Maybe we can put your connections
to good use.

245
00:36:28,323 --> 00:36:29,333
Pretty sure.

246
00:36:29,748 --> 00:36:31,567
- You understand what I want to do?
- Yes.

247
00:36:32,412 --> 00:36:33,931
- You with me?
- Yes.

248
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:38,282
Good. What do I want to do?

249
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,727
I think you said you understood
what I wanted to do.

250
00:36:45,827 --> 00:36:47,628
So, what do I want to do?

251
00:36:50,452 --> 00:36:53,683
I want to nail that son of a bitch!

252
00:36:55,887 --> 00:36:57,492
He's got a big mouth.

253
00:36:59,036 --> 00:37:01,670
He doesn't have the balls to stand up
for what he preaches.

254
00:37:51,122 --> 00:37:52,718
Will you take the gun, please.

255
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,624
What the hell's going on?

256
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:56,555
Just deserted from ZOMO.

257
00:37:56,556 --> 00:37:57,604
Take my hand.

258
00:37:57,604 --> 00:37:59,903
I can't go into the streets.
Full of militia.

259
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,650
Will you turn off the light, please.

260
00:38:08,144 --> 00:38:09,413
Spike!

261
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:16,553
- It's the dog's name.
- Nice name for a dog.

262
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:21,016
- I guess you want help.
- Who are you?

263
00:38:21,138 --> 00:38:23,851
I founded a Solidarity movement.
In the militia.

264
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:25,774
Got demoted, transferred to ZOMO.

265
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:28,617
Took part in several actions,
but it demanded too much of me.

266
00:38:30,744 --> 00:38:32,731
Josef, come here.

267
00:38:40,222 --> 00:38:43,499
What are you doing?
Are you stupid?

268
00:38:43,913 --> 00:38:45,999
I don't believe in converts.

269
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,179
- We've got to check him out.
- We should.

270
00:38:48,214 --> 00:38:49,502
I'll get Stašek.

271
00:38:53,871 --> 00:38:56,108
Can't go out, there's still curfew.

272
00:38:59,248 --> 00:39:00,855
He's coming.

273
00:39:01,413 --> 00:39:02,768
Move away from your position.

274
00:39:06,914 --> 00:39:08,772
Move away from your position!

275
00:39:11,175 --> 00:39:12,933
Not this way, dammit, you'll scare him!

276
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:15,137
Get back to the street!

277
00:39:27,634 --> 00:39:30,165
He's following you!
I thought you knew what you're doing!

278
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:31,166
He's right be...

279
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:32,951
Shit!

280
00:39:33,343 --> 00:39:35,427
Shit! Shit!

281
00:39:35,883 --> 00:39:37,260
Get back to the street!

282
00:39:38,091 --> 00:39:41,712
Get in the van!
Get in the fucking van!

283
00:40:12,632 --> 00:40:13,780
I recognize him.

284
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:16,635
He was with the militia Solidarity boys
during the congress.

285
00:40:16,635 --> 00:40:18,813
- You sure? 
- Yes. Hello everybody!

286
00:40:19,123 --> 00:40:20,809
Stašek recognized him.

287
00:40:22,899 --> 00:40:24,728
Solid gun. No question about it.

288
00:40:25,177 --> 00:40:27,543
I'd like us to help him get across the border.

289
00:40:28,142 --> 00:40:29,974
Come on, father,
we're not that powerful.

290
00:40:29,975 --> 00:40:30,915
Yet.

291
00:40:34,253 --> 00:40:37,092
He can stay in my aunt's flat
for the time being.

292
00:40:50,922 --> 00:40:53,983
- This is good for him.
- Who?

293
00:40:54,391 --> 00:40:56,404
He can't go out in his uniform.

294
00:40:56,752 --> 00:40:58,879
You need it more than he does.

295
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:02,714
Almost...

296
00:41:04,998 --> 00:41:07,453
Alek, I don't trust him.

297
00:41:10,524 --> 00:41:13,252
You don't really believe him, do you?

298
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,414
I have no choice.

299
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,184
- I hate them all!
- Anna...

300
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:57,036
I meant to ask you...

301
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:01,174
Are you allowed to take communion
twice a day?

302
00:42:03,924 --> 00:42:07,355
Don't you know that god hates exaggeration?

303
00:42:08,754 --> 00:42:11,162
Don't get ??? with me.

304
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,648
- You're too saintly.
- Be careful.

305
00:42:14,145 --> 00:42:16,792
Sometimes... sometimes...

306
00:42:17,316 --> 00:42:19,953
- I feel like beating you up!
- Try!

307
00:42:54,626 --> 00:42:55,734
Keys.

308
00:43:11,928 --> 00:43:14,289
I always forget about this.

309
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,520
I'll bring you some sheets tonight.

310
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:53,512
I could jump.

311
00:43:54,646 --> 00:43:56,140
If I had to.

312
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:58,761
No one is going to look for you here.

313
00:44:04,772 --> 00:44:06,756
Make yourself at home.

314
00:44:14,182 --> 00:44:16,539
Why did you come to me?

315
00:44:17,466 --> 00:44:20,152
All of Warsaw knows you'd help anyone.

316
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:24,417
Even someone like me...

317
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:29,006
That's going to get me into
many troubles some day.

318
00:44:32,906 --> 00:44:34,340
No curtains.

319
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:45,712
Hello.

320
00:44:45,747 --> 00:44:48,018
- Is your husband home?
- Yes.

321
00:44:49,878 --> 00:44:52,062
Let me show you something.

322
00:44:52,563 --> 00:44:56,588
I lost my hair in the camp.
No vitamins. And the cold.

323
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:08,604
Aren't they lovely!

324
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:14,041
My husband wants to have them put asleep.

325
00:45:14,139 --> 00:45:16,922
But maybe I can find someone
who'd take them.

326
00:45:19,094 --> 00:45:21,484
My son wants a dog.

327
00:45:22,592 --> 00:45:27,232
I knew it. I knew at least one of them
would get into good hands.

328
00:45:28,014 --> 00:45:28,625
Come on.

329
00:45:29,903 --> 00:45:33,355
I'm sorry to bother the colonel at this hour.

330
00:45:42,986 --> 00:45:44,607
Come on in!

331
00:45:45,294 --> 00:45:47,308
Could I have a word with you.

332
00:45:47,389 --> 00:45:51,030
- We have no secrets here.
- It'll just take a minute.

333
00:45:55,987 --> 00:45:57,837
Don't you look in my cards.

334
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:05,869
I think I found a way to deal with that priest.

335
00:46:07,016 --> 00:46:10,217
Do you remember Feliks and his
"Solidarity"?

336
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:14,563
- The one I wanted to get rid of.
- Yes.

337
00:46:16,379 --> 00:46:18,486
Deserted last night.

338
00:46:18,885 --> 00:46:20,221
What?!

339
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:35,389
On your feet!

340
00:46:42,121 --> 00:46:44,193
Ok, take him downstairs.

341
00:46:49,699 --> 00:46:54,408
5 years for harboring a deserter.
You understand?! 5 years.

342
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,080
5 years for possession of firearms.

343
00:47:01,538 --> 00:47:04,706
And 5 years for possession of subversive propaganda.

344
00:47:05,093 --> 00:47:08,146
That's 15 years of hard labor, father.

345
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,287
Be careful.

346
00:47:12,731 --> 00:47:13,988
Sorry.

347
00:47:27,422 --> 00:47:30,191
None of this belongs to me.

348
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:31,385
Oh, yes?

349
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:36,481
- Who does it belong to, then?
- You.

350
00:47:37,696 --> 00:47:40,736
You put it there, don't you?

351
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,632
What do you think we are?
Idiots?

352
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:47,059
Yes.

353
00:48:08,629 --> 00:48:11,657
- Good job.
- Thank you.

354
00:48:14,136 --> 00:48:15,821
<i>The question being asked is of course: </i>

355
00:48:15,822 --> 00:48:20,217
<i>What kind of religious activity
can this equipment be used for?"</i>

356
00:48:25,618 --> 00:48:29,167
- Where is the priest?
- First cell on the right. - Thank you.

357
00:48:42,911 --> 00:48:46,543
He's scared. You can see
how scared he is.

358
00:48:46,629 --> 00:48:48,759
- You're obsessed with that priest.
- I got him!

359
00:48:49,278 --> 00:48:52,918
- Now you're going to have to let him go.
- What are you talking about?

360
00:48:53,412 --> 00:48:58,046
The minister has just received a personal call
from the episcopate.

361
00:48:58,047 --> 00:49:01,807
But it... You s...

362
00:49:04,056 --> 00:49:05,125
Dammit!

363
00:49:05,221 --> 00:49:08,481
You sons of bitches are playing politics!

364
00:49:08,482 --> 00:49:11,812
There's going to be a general amnesty
in a couple of weeks!

365
00:49:12,296 --> 00:49:14,683
They would have let him go anyway!

366
00:49:19,536 --> 00:49:21,372
We'll get him another time.

367
00:49:22,345 --> 00:49:23,775
Damn!

368
00:49:50,592 --> 00:49:54,936
- Bless me, my father, but I will not come.
- You will go.

369
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,289
Do you realize how hard it was
to get you released?

370
00:49:58,752 --> 00:50:01,796
Hiding a deserter is a criminal offense.

371
00:50:02,093 --> 00:50:03,587
They set me up.

372
00:50:03,753 --> 00:50:06,196
But you thought he was a deserter.

373
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:12,607
The church must maintain
its relationship with the state.

374
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:17,535
We have to conduct
a long-term policy of compromise.

375
00:50:18,538 --> 00:50:22,388
And your actions, and notably
your presence at political trials,

376
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:24,745
are inconsistent with that policy.

377
00:50:26,862 --> 00:50:30,332
They were people from my parish.
I had to be with them.

378
00:50:30,393 --> 00:50:32,038
They had broken the law.

379
00:50:32,066 --> 00:50:33,776
It wasn't a just law!

380
00:50:35,194 --> 00:50:36,231
Sit down.

381
00:50:42,263 --> 00:50:44,551
Why do you think people come to me?

382
00:50:45,858 --> 00:50:47,963
They come to me
because I'm on their side.

383
00:50:48,808 --> 00:50:53,585
If I turn my back on them,
they will turn their back on the church.

384
00:50:56,316 --> 00:50:59,843
The church is 2000 years old.

385
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:04,419
And has done very well without you so far.

386
00:51:07,804 --> 00:51:10,505
If you want the glory of a guerilla priest,

387
00:51:10,605 --> 00:51:11,917
go to Nicaragua.

388
00:51:13,592 --> 00:51:15,962
God's will is to help my people.

389
00:51:16,045 --> 00:51:20,560
Is it god's will that you use his church
to advance your petty personal ambitions?

390
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:22,334
I've never done that.

391
00:51:22,576 --> 00:51:27,015
Is it god's will that you destroy
the church of Poland?

392
00:51:28,943 --> 00:51:32,503
What do you want to do?
Hit me?

393
00:51:45,176 --> 00:51:46,224
Please go.

394
00:51:51,175 --> 00:51:54,826
This work you have undertaken
is unbalancing you.

395
00:51:55,505 --> 00:51:59,026
And this is why I'm ordering
you to Rome, to study.

396
00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:05,872
His holy father has expressed his joy
that you will be by his side.

397
00:52:09,099 --> 00:52:12,406
Is that the compromise you've agreed?

398
00:52:12,911 --> 00:52:15,410
They'll release me and
you send me out of the country?

399
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:19,082
If you refuse to go,
I'll send you to a rural parish

400
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:21,208
and you won't be allowed
to give any sermons.

401
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:26,163
You have no right to risk your life.

402
00:52:26,631 --> 00:52:28,548
God gave it to you.

403
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,453
It is a great sin.

404
00:52:33,107 --> 00:52:35,773
He who gives himself, saves himself.

405
00:52:36,822 --> 00:52:39,483
He who protects himself, loses himself.

406
00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:41,868
Who do you think you are?!

407
00:52:42,643 --> 00:52:45,126
A new Jesus Christ with dreams of martyrdom?!

408
00:52:46,944 --> 00:52:50,464
Are you trying to prove yourself
better than anyone else?

409
00:53:58,585 --> 00:53:59,794
- Hello.
- Hello.

410
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:07,259
Pope's dead. - What?
- They poisoned him.

411
00:54:07,888 --> 00:54:08,787
You're joking?

412
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,422
They must have thrown something
through the window.

413
00:54:11,422 --> 00:54:15,127
- You mean the dog Pope is dead?
- Yes.

414
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:25,594
Oh, shit...

415
00:54:48,022 --> 00:54:49,819
He's going to be cold.

416
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:54,033
He doesn't feel anything anymore.

417
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:56,980
- Go away.
- Just want to watch.

418
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,299
Dad, don't...

419
00:55:02,172 --> 00:55:04,630
Get the hell out of here!

420
00:55:10,606 --> 00:55:14,118
- Why don't they want to play with me?
- Who, them?

421
00:55:14,797 --> 00:55:20,391
Not just them. At school, no one wants
to play with me, or talk to me. Why?

422
00:55:25,165 --> 00:55:26,743
Why?!

423
00:55:34,015 --> 00:55:36,027
It's because of you.

424
00:55:50,737 --> 00:55:52,597
What's because of me?

425
00:55:59,402 --> 00:56:00,870
What's because of me?

426
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:09,371
Look at me when I talk to you!
What's because of me?

427
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,635
What's because of me?!

428
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,712
Everything.

429
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:32,203
You really think I'm so bad?

430
00:56:35,871 --> 00:56:37,938
What do you want me to do?

431
00:56:44,496 --> 00:56:48,648
- I want to make a cross for him.
- You don't put crosses on dogs.

432
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:55,661
The guys at school put crosses on the walls.
They say that they should be everywhere.

433
00:57:17,273 --> 00:57:23,035
A cross for Pope? It sounds like
a story for the catholic weekly.

434
00:57:24,395 --> 00:57:27,085
- I don't think it's so funny.
- You don't?

435
00:57:27,975 --> 00:57:30,697
My son puts a cross on his dog's grave
because his school friends think

436
00:57:31,027 --> 00:57:33,379
that crucifixes should be everywhere.

437
00:57:34,113 --> 00:57:37,619
They won't play with him,
because of who his father is.

438
00:57:39,382 --> 00:57:41,231
- That's the world you left us.
- We?

439
00:57:41,302 --> 00:57:43,336
Yes, you. You could have
cleaned it all up under Stalin.

440
00:57:43,336 --> 00:57:45,244
We did. With guns.

441
00:57:45,244 --> 00:57:46,843
We eliminated the scum.

442
00:57:46,843 --> 00:57:49,472
Now all you have to do
is get rid of a few priests.

443
00:57:49,472 --> 00:57:51,174
You should have hung them all
when you had the chance.

444
00:57:51,174 --> 00:57:53,927
The class struggle isn't over yet.
Read some Lenin!

445
00:57:53,927 --> 00:57:57,620
What fucking right do you have
to tell me about Lenin?

446
00:58:03,558 --> 00:58:05,977
Stefan, how could you?

447
00:58:06,131 --> 00:58:07,053
Why?

448
00:58:09,342 --> 00:58:10,916
Why is he so offended?

449
00:58:12,602 --> 00:58:15,708
Why doesn't he try to explain
to his grandson and his daughter-in-law

450
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:17,544
why they can't stop being afraid.

451
00:58:19,443 --> 00:58:21,720
This is terror, you understand?

452
00:58:22,787 --> 00:58:24,891
They're drawing gallows on our front door.

453
00:58:24,977 --> 00:58:27,675
Calm down, father's sick.

454
00:58:27,688 --> 00:58:29,406
Well, he wasn't sick
when I was in summer camp

455
00:58:29,406 --> 00:58:32,110
and the village boys were stoning us
and calling us Commies.

456
00:58:33,545 --> 00:58:35,069
I've still got the scars.
See?

457
00:58:35,069 --> 00:58:36,276
See that?
See it?

458
00:58:37,066 --> 00:58:45,832
Long life, long life, long life to our dear dad!

459
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:50,913
Once again, once again:
Long life to our dear dad!

460
00:58:50,914 --> 00:58:56,115
- Long life to our dear dad!
- What is this?

461
00:58:56,673 --> 00:58:58,037
It's your birthday.

462
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:06,479
And what am I supposed to do
with this, hang myself?

463
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:14,147
I told you we shouldn't do it.

464
00:59:37,966 --> 00:59:42,343
Halina? You shouldn't.
He's your husband.

465
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:49,336
He hasn't been my husband for a long time.

466
01:00:19,641 --> 01:00:20,799
Bastard!

467
01:00:22,445 --> 01:00:25,697
We must get Alek out of here.
The bishop was right.

468
01:00:26,074 --> 01:00:28,971
They won't touch him.
All of Poland knows him.

469
01:00:28,972 --> 01:00:29,972
He's there.

470
01:00:32,226 --> 01:00:34,987
- You should stay inside.
- Have you seen the dog?

471
01:00:35,355 --> 01:00:36,939
He'll be back.

472
01:00:39,708 --> 01:00:45,736
I don't hate them anymore.
They can beat me, kill me...

473
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:49,629
And I sincerely can pray for them.

474
01:00:50,198 --> 01:00:52,131
Do you understand?

475
01:00:52,918 --> 01:00:54,861
I'm free.

476
01:00:57,534 --> 01:00:59,635
I'm really free.

477
01:01:27,221 --> 01:01:28,706
Get out!

478
01:01:41,995 --> 01:01:43,709
I can't...

479
01:01:53,135 --> 01:01:55,224
You don't knock anymore?

480
01:01:57,532 --> 01:01:59,858
- What is it?
- It's my resignation.

481
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:04,883
I just promoted you.

482
01:02:04,884 --> 01:02:07,132
You're the youngest department
head in the ministry.

483
01:02:07,167 --> 01:02:09,254
- You make good money.
- I get paid for doing nothing.

484
01:02:09,254 --> 01:02:14,745
I spy, I video tape, I wire tap,
I drive around his apartment in circles...

485
01:02:17,091 --> 01:02:18,528
It's just a game.

486
01:02:18,528 --> 01:02:22,545
We catch the organizers, and then
they're all set free in a general amnesty.

487
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:25,191
You read the official communique?

488
01:02:25,191 --> 01:02:27,779
You think an article in the newspaper
is going to scare them?

489
01:02:27,779 --> 01:02:29,100
They're going to burn this
in the church while the

490
01:02:29,101 --> 01:02:31,487
entire congregation
stands up and applauds.

491
01:02:32,794 --> 01:02:35,128
You know, maybe... 
Well, maybe...

492
01:02:36,488 --> 01:02:39,322
Maybe I could go and take a shit
in front of an altar.

493
01:02:40,436 --> 01:02:43,881
But the goddamned politicians
will probably ask me to clean it up!

494
01:02:47,611 --> 01:02:50,797
I thought our job was to try to silence
these sons of bitches!

495
01:02:52,298 --> 01:02:54,005
We are working on that.

496
01:02:54,934 --> 01:02:56,745
Will you stop that?!

497
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:01,369
We have a plan to...

498
01:03:01,783 --> 01:03:04,760
How to blow up a church?
How to blow up a plane with a bishop on it?

499
01:03:05,138 --> 01:03:07,260
How to throw a priest off a train?

500
01:03:07,763 --> 01:03:09,780
To see if they can fly.

501
01:03:10,681 --> 01:03:12,253
Asshole.

502
01:03:14,558 --> 01:03:18,700
All our plans've become top secret, they're
locked up somewhere, I've got a safe for them.

503
01:03:21,988 --> 01:03:25,141
Please comrade, just accept my resignation.

504
01:03:31,005 --> 01:03:33,386
- I'll think about it.
- Thank you.

505
01:03:41,325 --> 01:03:45,907
- Your men still trailing that priest?
- Yes, you want us to tighten security?

506
01:03:46,403 --> 01:03:50,320
Tell them if he leaves the city,
they're not to follow him.

507
01:03:50,321 --> 01:03:51,321
Why?

508
01:03:52,827 --> 01:03:54,822
Take these with you.

509
01:03:58,291 --> 01:03:59,636
We fear pain.

510
01:04:02,292 --> 01:04:05,148
We fear being deprived of liberty.

511
01:04:07,201 --> 01:04:09,161
We fear for our lives.

512
01:04:10,262 --> 01:04:15,243
We overcame fear when we accepted
suffering in the name of higher values.

513
01:04:17,164 --> 01:04:19,033
In the name of truth.

514
01:04:22,246 --> 01:04:24,811
And when we overcome our fears,

515
01:04:24,812 --> 01:04:28,444
then we're truly free.

516
01:04:31,575 --> 01:04:33,728
Christ told his disciples,

517
01:04:35,854 --> 01:04:38,948
"Don't be afraid of those who kill the body."

518
01:04:41,899 --> 01:04:44,532
"They can do nothing to you."

519
01:05:01,117 --> 01:05:02,617
Christ.

520
01:05:03,023 --> 01:05:05,886
It's a historical fact that Christ
never existed, you know.

521
01:05:06,085 --> 01:05:09,141
His mother never, ahem, never did it.

522
01:05:10,445 --> 01:05:14,750
If he hadn't existed,
they wouldn't have had to kill him.

523
01:05:16,182 --> 01:05:22,142
All we need is one machine gun
right there, and then...

524
01:05:30,203 --> 01:05:31,780
That would be too easy.

525
01:05:48,523 --> 01:05:52,979
Look, I understand your frustration.
I think I can help.

526
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:56,055
Do you play Bridge?

527
01:05:59,094 --> 01:06:00,500
Yes.

528
01:06:02,049 --> 01:06:03,711
My place, Saturday evening.

529
01:06:21,014 --> 01:06:22,317
- Slow it down.
- Why?

530
01:06:22,772 --> 01:06:23,786
Just do it.

531
01:06:48,474 --> 01:06:50,028
Out!

532
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:05,599
What did you think of
the official communique?

533
01:07:07,457 --> 01:07:09,071
Excellent, for once.

534
01:07:09,923 --> 01:07:13,044
You think that we can't stop
the counter-revolution with a pen?

535
01:07:14,157 --> 01:07:16,392
I think what we need is action.

536
01:07:19,159 --> 01:07:21,329
Would you like it?

537
01:07:22,422 --> 01:07:25,151
It's exactly what I need.

538
01:07:28,926 --> 01:07:33,163
Low reds are still stronger than high blacks.

539
01:07:37,823 --> 01:07:41,075
You play very well.
I like your style.

540
01:07:42,305 --> 01:07:43,672
Thank you.

541
01:07:50,626 --> 01:07:53,000
It was a pleasure to meet you.

542
01:07:58,823 --> 01:08:00,290
- Good evening.
- Good night.

543
01:08:11,801 --> 01:08:15,425
- How's the puppy doing?
- He's dead. - No!

544
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:18,246
It must have been terrible for your daughter.

545
01:08:18,346 --> 01:08:20,130
For my son it was.

546
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:29,029
He likes you. You can handle it
any way you want.

547
01:08:31,269 --> 01:08:33,597
This is going to be the beginning
of a new life for you.

548
01:08:34,046 --> 01:08:37,723
- How far can I go?
- We trust you.

549
01:08:37,723 --> 01:08:42,364
- He's got a weak heart?
- His heart is his problem.

550
01:08:58,034 --> 01:08:59,728
It's here...

551
01:08:59,737 --> 01:09:02,090
Apartment 38, third floor.

552
01:09:03,065 --> 01:09:04,854
A militia captain lives across the hall.

553
01:09:04,915 --> 01:09:06,717
Couldn't they hide somewhere else?

554
01:09:07,237 --> 01:09:10,634
- They're less likely to be detected.
- Well...

555
01:09:16,102 --> 01:09:17,257
I'll be here...

556
01:09:32,289 --> 01:09:35,799
- Oh, I'm sorry...
- You frightened me.

557
01:09:36,331 --> 01:09:37,568
I'm sorry...

558
01:09:44,376 --> 01:09:45,781
Thank you.

559
01:10:06,025 --> 01:10:07,591
- Which floor?
- Third.

560
01:10:07,592 --> 01:10:09,729
I'm going to the fourth.

561
01:11:10,436 --> 01:11:11,208
Who is this?

562
01:11:12,979 --> 01:11:18,015
I've brought... I've brought you
the medicine you ordered from doctor Borek.

563
01:11:22,733 --> 01:11:25,799
It's confirmed. He's giving
a ceremony, in Kutno, tomorrow.

564
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,289
- Are we going to follow him there?
- Of course.

565
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:28,257
What's the plan?

566
01:11:28,257 --> 01:11:30,477
The bosses have finally realized

567
01:11:30,478 --> 01:11:32,908
that the counter-revolution
can't be stopped with a pen.

568
01:11:32,908 --> 01:11:33,957
Have we got clearance?

569
01:11:33,957 --> 01:11:38,066
- Did you get the uniforms?
- Yes, I got them on the free market.

570
01:11:38,066 --> 01:11:41,457
I took the caps from the locker room.
Nobody saw me.

571
01:11:43,231 --> 01:11:44,419
Is everything ready?

572
01:11:44,419 --> 01:11:48,422
Yeah, I got the sack of ropes
for rocks all locked in the safe.

573
01:11:48,518 --> 01:11:50,601
- The vodka?
- Yeah, I got the vodka.

574
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:57,401
If we're going to leave the city,
we'll need a... pass.

575
01:12:01,284 --> 01:12:03,052
That's valid all over the country.

576
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:04,687
You know who signs stuff like that?

577
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,746
Everything's ready, dad.

578
01:12:26,381 --> 01:12:29,140
They know what I look like.
What happens if they recognize me?

579
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:30,364
They won't have time.

580
01:12:33,305 --> 01:12:34,373
Fire!

581
01:12:38,225 --> 01:12:42,532
Bogdan, take this ring as a sign
of my love and my faithfulness.

582
01:12:42,532 --> 01:12:45,835
In the name of the father,
the son, and the holy ghost.

583
01:12:47,742 --> 01:12:52,106
Eva, take this ring as a sign
of my love and my faithfulness.

584
01:12:52,687 --> 01:12:56,172
In the name of the father,
the son, and the holy ghost.

585
01:13:22,370 --> 01:13:26,390
- What took so long?
- It was a double wedding.

586
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:28,303
After the militia came, I started counting.

587
01:13:28,304 --> 01:13:30,699
I said, "If he's not out by 100,
he's been arrested."

588
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:32,874
You got out at 132!

589
01:13:51,405 --> 01:13:52,765
Do you want me to drive?

590
01:13:53,956 --> 01:13:55,889
Don't go to Kutno tomorrow.

591
01:13:56,249 --> 01:13:58,748
I'll be back by the time you count to 1000.

592
01:14:02,332 --> 01:14:03,327
You're right.

593
01:14:04,876 --> 01:14:07,354
It would be better if Josef
didn't come with me tomorrow.

594
01:14:07,355 --> 01:14:09,735
It was not Josef I was thinking about.

595
01:14:35,644 --> 01:14:36,977
I...

596
01:14:38,455 --> 01:14:39,563
Thank you, Anna.

597
01:15:21,527 --> 01:15:23,207
Kiss me...

598
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:26,673
Just once.

599
01:15:32,193 --> 01:15:34,160
I'm not that strong.

600
01:15:46,921 --> 01:15:49,601
I don't want compassion!

601
01:16:15,331 --> 01:16:16,923
Why are you still up?

602
01:16:16,923 --> 01:16:19,025
I can't finish my sermon.

603
01:16:22,872 --> 01:16:24,694
I've the feeling I've said everything.

604
01:16:24,694 --> 01:16:27,015
They haven't heard you yet in Kutno.

605
01:17:11,081 --> 01:17:12,017
I'm sorry...

606
01:17:13,005 --> 01:17:14,043
Now what?

607
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:16,930
I should be writing my will.

608
01:17:17,619 --> 01:17:19,475
That's not funny.

609
01:17:29,175 --> 01:17:30,087
Hello.

610
01:17:31,793 --> 01:17:34,722
- Father Alek?
- Yes.

611
01:17:38,903 --> 01:17:41,761
Are you still going to Kutno tomorrow?

612
01:17:42,756 --> 01:17:43,954
Yes.

613
01:17:44,441 --> 01:17:46,018
Don't go.

614
01:17:47,009 --> 01:17:48,633
They're out to get you.

615
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:53,198
- How do you know?
- I work for them.

616
01:17:58,557 --> 01:17:59,752
Well, are you going or not?

617
01:17:59,753 --> 01:18:04,994
I don't know.
I'll decide tomorrow. Thank you.

618
01:18:04,994 --> 01:18:06,842
Don't try to be a fucking hero!

619
01:18:08,802 --> 01:18:10,283
Goddammit!

620
01:18:11,566 --> 01:18:13,734
Don't go.

621
01:19:54,439 --> 01:19:58,234
- Are you sure this is the church?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

622
01:19:59,771 --> 01:20:01,664
Where are the crowds?

623
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:04,144
Maybe he's not coming.

624
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:08,933
Stay here.

625
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,274
Nice sweater.

626
01:20:16,355 --> 01:20:17,796
It's French.

627
01:21:31,943 --> 01:21:34,937
The trial of Christ is still in progress.

628
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:39,914
Its actors are still among us.

629
01:21:42,018 --> 01:21:44,216
Only the names have changed.

630
01:21:44,823 --> 01:21:49,061
All those who hate,
all those who use violence,

631
01:21:50,054 --> 01:21:53,805
all those who cause the suffering
of their brothers and sisters,

632
01:21:54,498 --> 01:21:57,028
all those whe take away their freedom,

633
01:21:57,853 --> 01:22:00,564
participate in the trial of Christ.

634
01:22:02,658 --> 01:22:05,617
- This is a private mass, for the seminarists.
- I'm sorry.

635
01:22:05,618 --> 01:22:14,593
We ask you, oh Lord, to have pity on those
who use force against our brothers and sisters.

636
01:22:14,628 --> 01:22:18,537
Listen, oh Lord, to what your people pray.

637
01:22:53,951 --> 01:22:55,749
- Wake up.
- What?

638
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:59,428
Wake up, goddammit!
Start the car. Start the car!

639
01:23:10,812 --> 01:23:14,064
- Goddammit, start the fucking car!
- Pull the choke.

640
01:23:15,771 --> 01:23:17,809
Start the fucking car or I will fucking kill you!

641
01:23:18,695 --> 01:23:20,852
Start the car, goddammit!

642
01:23:21,482 --> 01:23:23,693
- Oh no.
- Shit, shit!

643
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:25,171
Get out, let's go!

644
01:23:25,708 --> 01:23:27,281
Push! Push!

645
01:23:29,175 --> 01:23:30,777
Would you get off the goddamn break?

646
01:23:32,201 --> 01:23:35,471
- Somebody get in the car for Christ's sake!
- I'll get in the driving seat.

647
01:23:37,547 --> 01:23:40,224
- Push! - I have it.
- Push! Harder!

648
01:23:41,475 --> 01:23:43,737
The one about the two militiamen and logic.

649
01:23:44,476 --> 01:23:47,829
Two militiamen meet, one's got a book.
The other one says:

650
01:23:47,829 --> 01:23:49,946
What's the book?
- Logic.

651
01:23:49,946 --> 01:23:52,037
- What's logic?
- Well, I'm going to tell you.

652
01:23:52,037 --> 01:23:56,490
Have you got an acquarium? - Yes.
- That means you like fish? - Yes.

653
01:23:56,490 --> 01:24:02,145
That means you like animals? - Yes.
That means you like people? - Yes, I do.

654
01:24:02,145 --> 01:24:04,305
So that means you like women? - Yes.

655
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:07,256
So that means you're not a faggot.
This is logic, you see.

656
01:24:07,256 --> 01:24:08,685
Now hold on, that's not it.

657
01:24:08,685 --> 01:24:12,073
Now what does this joker do?
I can't see a thing.

658
01:24:13,436 --> 01:24:17,334
Ok, so, the second militiaman
was so impressed with this

659
01:24:17,335 --> 01:24:18,663
he rushes into a bookstore,

660
01:24:18,663 --> 01:24:20,280
and buys the book, on logic.

661
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:26,951
- You want some of this sausage?
- No, no. I can't believe you're still eating.

662
01:24:26,951 --> 01:24:29,142
You have to overeat to show
how much you love them.

663
01:24:30,121 --> 01:24:32,165
Dim your headlights,
you dummy, you!

664
01:24:32,165 --> 01:24:33,833
I think he's doing it on purpose.

665
01:24:38,366 --> 01:24:39,625
Let him pass.

666
01:24:39,625 --> 01:24:42,631
So, the second militiaman
comes out of the bookstore,

667
01:24:42,666 --> 01:24:44,938
meets a third miltiaman
who sees the book, says,

668
01:24:44,938 --> 01:24:46,926
"What's the book?" He said, "Logic."
- "What's logic?"

669
01:24:46,926 --> 01:24:48,829
He said, "I'm going to tell you."

670
01:24:48,829 --> 01:24:51,872
"You got an aquarium?" He says, "No."
"Then that means you're a faggot."

671
01:25:03,293 --> 01:25:04,732
Stop the car.

672
01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:05,454
What? You're joking...
They're not cops.

673
01:25:08,909 --> 01:25:10,359
They're wearing uniform.

674
01:25:11,846 --> 01:25:13,335
Stop the car.

675
01:25:15,325 --> 01:25:17,287
Stop the car!

676
01:25:28,315 --> 01:25:32,291
- What's wrong?
- Get out of the car, please. - Why?

677
01:25:32,718 --> 01:25:35,018
- Have you been drinking? - No.
- Give me the keys.

678
01:25:37,148 --> 01:25:39,508
Come on out, alcohol test, come on.

679
01:25:52,466 --> 01:25:55,663
You don't need to say anything,
do you? Do you?

680
01:25:58,772 --> 01:26:01,491
Stick this in your mouth, that's good.
Just sit tight.

681
01:26:04,216 --> 01:26:06,991
That's not too tight, is it?
Not too tight?

682
01:26:07,339 --> 01:26:09,183
You sure? You're ok?

683
01:26:20,745 --> 01:26:22,215
What's wrong?

684
01:26:23,588 --> 01:26:24,986
Good evening, father.

685
01:26:26,635 --> 01:26:30,647
Don't fucking move!
Don't fucking move.

686
01:26:43,284 --> 01:26:44,479
Help!

687
01:26:52,069 --> 01:26:54,735
Hey Feliks, which lever is the trunk?

688
01:26:55,093 --> 01:26:56,231
The left one.

689
01:26:57,118 --> 01:26:58,440
Hey asshole!

690
01:26:59,215 --> 01:27:01,828
Don't fucking say my name.

691
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:25,145
Take off!

692
01:27:34,995 --> 01:27:36,493
Let's get these uniforms off!

693
01:27:39,066 --> 01:27:40,171
The buttons.

694
01:27:40,296 --> 01:27:42,731
Wait, I'll help you.
Keep your hands on the wheel.

695
01:27:44,566 --> 01:27:45,525
Help!

696
01:27:45,907 --> 01:27:50,215
- You didn't tie him up?
- What for? He's not going anywhere.

697
01:27:51,554 --> 01:27:53,447
Keep your hands on the wheel!

698
01:27:55,489 --> 01:27:58,042
What about that car?
They're going to find it.

699
01:27:58,142 --> 01:27:59,555
They won't find it for a while.

700
01:27:59,556 --> 01:28:01,447
We'll be back in Warzaw by then,
don't worry.

701
01:28:09,632 --> 01:28:11,635
Watch that kid!
Hold!

702
01:28:14,295 --> 01:28:17,248
- Stop the car!
- He's got to be dead. Keep going!

703
01:28:17,781 --> 01:28:20,116
We can't let him go.
He knows who I am.

704
01:28:20,665 --> 01:28:23,333
- He knows my name!
- Keep going!

705
01:28:30,175 --> 01:28:31,486
Give it some gas.

706
01:28:32,566 --> 01:28:34,448
Step on the clutch and give it some gas.

707
01:28:36,034 --> 01:28:38,652
Oh Jesus Christ, that's all we need.

708
01:28:40,385 --> 01:28:43,654
We can't go on like this. We've got to
let him go. A priest?

709
01:28:44,748 --> 01:28:46,865
He's not moving anymore.

710
01:28:48,507 --> 01:28:49,814
Slow down.

711
01:28:50,931 --> 01:28:52,247
Turn left up here.

712
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:53,143
Where?

713
01:28:53,144 --> 01:28:55,370
Right here. Up that dirt road.
Go check the fuel line.

714
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:05,993
Stop here.

715
01:29:07,168 --> 01:29:08,796
Open the hood.

716
01:29:08,942 --> 01:29:12,524
- Not that one, you asshole!
- Help! Help!

717
01:29:24,898 --> 01:29:27,069
I told you not to come.

718
01:29:27,479 --> 01:29:29,528
It's you?

719
01:29:37,413 --> 01:29:38,644
Get the rope!

720
01:29:43,014 --> 01:29:45,011
Hurry up!

721
01:29:48,536 --> 01:29:50,326
Put it on!

722
01:29:55,757 --> 01:29:58,058
You recognized me, you fuck!

723
01:29:59,903 --> 01:30:01,998
- That's enough!
- He knows who I am!

724
01:30:01,999 --> 01:30:04,072
- That's enough!
- He recognized me!

725
01:30:06,967 --> 01:30:08,260
That's enough!

726
01:30:12,733 --> 01:30:13,816
Let's go!

727
01:30:22,028 --> 01:30:25,051
I thought you said he had a weak heart!

728
01:30:26,339 --> 01:30:28,671
It seems pretty strong to me!

729
01:30:29,081 --> 01:30:30,625
Did you get that fixed?

730
01:30:31,683 --> 01:30:34,733
Mmm, I t-t-t-hink so...

731
01:30:43,071 --> 01:30:44,815
Open up!

732
01:30:46,166 --> 01:30:48,174
Open the door!

733
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:58,643
The priest...

734
01:31:00,888 --> 01:31:02,833
They kidnapped him.

735
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:05,945
Father Alek!

736
01:31:07,574 --> 01:31:11,081
They're going to kill him!
Where's the nearest phone?

737
01:31:10,986 --> 01:31:13,191
What do you want?

738
01:31:15,863 --> 01:31:18,120
Where's the phone?!

739
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,498
There, use the switch board...

740
01:31:23,801 --> 01:31:27,549
We must call the nearest priest.

741
01:31:34,905 --> 01:31:37,307
- Should I stop?
- Yes.

742
01:31:39,572 --> 01:31:42,803
Shut up! Just stay quiet.

743
01:31:43,824 --> 01:31:46,764
- Good evening. - Good evening.
- Papers, please.

744
01:31:50,602 --> 01:31:54,430
- Feliks, did you pick up the pass?
- No, I don't have the pass, no.

745
01:31:57,272 --> 01:32:00,014
- I know I've got it.
- Ok.

746
01:32:04,532 --> 01:32:07,839
- Is there some problem, officer?
- Some priest got kidnapped.

747
01:32:08,430 --> 01:32:11,030
Great. Okay. Good night.

748
01:32:13,543 --> 01:32:14,469
Hey!

749
01:32:15,025 --> 01:32:15,829
What?

750
01:32:16,276 --> 01:32:18,720
- You're from Warsaw, aren't you?
- Yes.

751
01:32:19,065 --> 01:32:23,938
My brother-in-law works in Praga precinct.
Jarek Glira. You know him?

752
01:32:27,145 --> 01:32:31,887
- You guys know a Jarek Glira.
- No. - You sure?

753
01:32:34,175 --> 01:32:37,733
- You never know. Good night!
- Good night.

754
01:33:10,829 --> 01:33:13,225
Come on, let's get it over with.

755
01:33:17,557 --> 01:33:20,179
It wasn't s-s-supposed to be like this.
It wasn't.

756
01:33:47,238 --> 01:33:48,724
Give me the bag.

757
01:34:02,021 --> 01:34:04,232
Get it down on him...

758
01:34:08,613 --> 01:34:09,638
Wait...

759
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:12,712
Get the stones.

760
01:34:18,341 --> 01:34:21,108
Get the stones,
throw the stones over.

761
01:34:31,102 --> 01:34:34,983
Everything's alright.
They'll never find him.

762
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:39,054
- C-c-couldn't possibly...
- Where's the vodka?

763
01:34:41,895 --> 01:34:43,595
No-no-not sinking.

764
01:34:44,553 --> 01:34:46,975
He's not sinking!

765
01:34:48,422 --> 01:34:49,485
He's not... not sink...

766
01:35:18,209 --> 01:35:21,002
I-I-It wasn't s-s-supposed to be l-l-like that...

767
01:36:03,136 --> 01:36:04,637
Stefan...

768
01:36:14,277 --> 01:36:15,775
Stefan...

769
01:36:46,034 --> 01:36:48,983
- You've been drinking...
- Yes...

770
01:37:43,457 --> 01:37:46,446
I thought you didn't love me anymore.

771
01:37:51,942 --> 01:37:53,159
Heard the news?

772
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:56,317
I've been after this guy for months,
just when I'm about to get him...

773
01:37:57,098 --> 01:37:58,348
He disappears.

774
01:37:59,265 --> 01:38:00,882
He's waiting for you.

775
01:38:03,167 --> 01:38:06,064
Send someone to Kutno
and get their licence plate numbers.

776
01:38:06,064 --> 01:38:09,670
No, no, you'll report everything
back to me. Good.

777
01:38:09,707 --> 01:38:11,088
Have you any idea who
kidnapped him?

778
01:38:11,553 --> 01:38:14,531
Any suspicions?

779
01:38:15,107 --> 01:38:16,591
No, I don't.

780
01:38:17,478 --> 01:38:19,911
That is what I thought.

781
01:38:22,056 --> 01:38:25,192
- Where is he? - Who?
- The priest!

782
01:38:25,533 --> 01:38:29,341
- He's floating somewhere.
- Shit, shit, shit!

783
01:38:31,605 --> 01:38:34,629
How could you let that bloody driver escape?

784
01:38:34,896 --> 01:38:37,185
We're covered from the top, aren't we?

785
01:38:38,576 --> 01:38:40,256
Aren't we?

786
01:38:41,471 --> 01:38:45,398
WE WANT FATHER ALEK!
WE WANT FATHER ALEK!

787
01:38:50,824 --> 01:38:53,004
Please let them through,
have a little respect.

788
01:38:54,092 --> 01:38:56,182
When was the last time you saw your son?

789
01:38:56,182 --> 01:38:58,286
Did the Interior Ministry try to contact you?

790
01:38:58,286 --> 01:39:00,239
Who do you think is responsible for the kidnapping?

791
01:39:02,101 --> 01:39:03,510
Have you seen the archbishop yet?

792
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:06,240
Did you expect anything like this to happen?

793
01:39:06,764 --> 01:39:08,727
Do you know who is reponsible for the kidnapping?

794
01:39:08,727 --> 01:39:10,462
Don't say anything.

795
01:39:10,462 --> 01:39:13,099
I only pray that they won't harm him.

796
01:39:13,099 --> 01:39:15,595
Do you have a photograph of him with you?

797
01:39:18,093 --> 01:39:20,324
Here he's with the pope.

798
01:39:20,798 --> 01:39:23,283
He's a good son.
We are proud of him.

799
01:39:34,279 --> 01:39:38,474
WE WANT FATHER ALEK!
WE WANT FATHER ALEK!

800
01:39:38,614 --> 01:39:39,894
Stašek!

801
01:39:42,230 --> 01:39:43,544
We know nothing!

802
01:39:52,148 --> 01:39:55,882
Now you are really making my day, captain.

803
01:39:58,020 --> 01:40:01,186
Listen to this.
Just play it.

804
01:40:04,391 --> 01:40:08,170
- Hello!
- Father Alek? - Yes.

805
01:40:09,347 --> 01:40:11,695
- Are you still going to Kutno tomorrow?
- Yes.

806
01:40:11,695 --> 01:40:14,365
Don't go. They're out to get you.

807
01:40:15,571 --> 01:40:16,589
How do you know?

808
01:40:17,855 --> 01:40:19,925
Why do I get the impression
that this is your voice?

809
01:40:19,925 --> 01:40:22,422
- Why would I do something like that?
- You tell me.

810
01:40:23,288 --> 01:40:25,881
What is it?!
What the hell do you want?!

811
01:40:26,501 --> 01:40:28,130
A call on the security line, sir.

812
01:40:36,149 --> 01:40:40,899
Is that you, colonel?
- I... Yes, it's me.

813
01:40:41,758 --> 01:40:44,576
The guilty must be found and punished.

814
01:40:45,935 --> 01:40:49,343
Yes... I understand.

815
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:51,972
I'm not sure that you do understand.

816
01:40:53,013 --> 01:40:56,946
From now on, you're on your own.
Do you understand that?

817
01:40:58,066 --> 01:41:01,720
- Yes I do, but...
- There's a witness.

818
01:41:03,249 --> 01:41:05,802
- Cou-Could I see you?
- No.

819
01:41:06,426 --> 01:41:09,863
It will be better for all concerned
if I never see you again.

820
01:41:15,288 --> 01:41:19,416
- That means I have to...
- That was not an order.

821
01:41:19,829 --> 01:41:21,112
Just advice.

822
01:41:24,737 --> 01:41:25,703
Yes.

823
01:41:26,302 --> 01:41:29,930
Good luck then. We're counting on you.

824
01:41:55,129 --> 01:41:58,677
YOU NEVER PLAYED BRIDGE

825
01:42:23,149 --> 01:42:29,880
First and above all:
I am an officer of the security service!

826
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:43,869
- You're finished?
- Yes.

827
01:42:45,137 --> 01:42:46,521
I said I went to Krakow.

828
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:50,265
Why Krakow?

829
01:42:50,912 --> 01:42:54,319
Well, it's the same distance.
And I met a girl there...

830
01:42:55,539 --> 01:43:00,187
Come on, Feliks. Who's going to
believe you and a girl?

831
01:43:05,893 --> 01:43:09,827
You think you're so clever,
you do it.

832
01:43:14,664 --> 01:43:16,718
I'm not a writer.

833
01:43:16,757 --> 01:43:18,162
You do it.

834
01:43:34,879 --> 01:43:37,925
I-I don't know what to write.

835
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:40,526
Well, say you were at home.

836
01:43:41,603 --> 01:43:43,850
Your wive will cover for you.

837
01:43:48,623 --> 01:43:54,363
M-m-my little boy was sick, you see,
so my mother-in-law was there, she...

838
01:43:54,363 --> 01:43:57,330
doesn't like me...
You see...

839
01:43:57,331 --> 01:44:02,132
You know, she doesn't like me.

840
01:44:04,213 --> 01:44:06,476
Feliks, you said that the men at the top...

841
01:44:07,482 --> 01:44:09,048
They didn't find the body.

842
01:44:12,237 --> 01:44:14,359
Open the door!

843
01:44:23,310 --> 01:44:24,726
Open the door,
we know you're there!

844
01:44:27,485 --> 01:44:28,908
We're fine.

845
01:44:39,567 --> 01:44:41,940
I-I-I had to tell them.

846
01:44:47,968 --> 01:44:49,431
- What's wrong?
- Pack some clothes.

847
01:44:49,431 --> 01:44:51,680
You have to move out immediately.

848
01:44:52,156 --> 01:44:54,393
- Just take what you absolutely need.
- Where is Stefan?

849
01:44:54,782 --> 01:44:58,566
They've all been arrested.
Stefan, Igor, Feliks, the colonel...

850
01:44:58,825 --> 01:45:01,892
We better hurry!
All of you: Don't waste time!

851
01:45:03,958 --> 01:45:05,237
Hand me that suitcase.

852
01:45:08,168 --> 01:45:09,679
Get dressed.

853
01:45:10,544 --> 01:45:12,503
Take your school books.

854
01:45:14,561 --> 01:45:16,302
We have to go.

855
01:45:19,050 --> 01:45:20,701
Mom...

856
01:45:21,312 --> 01:45:24,123
Dad killed that priest, didn't he?

857
01:45:34,356 --> 01:45:37,285
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, that I did it, I'm sorry...

858
01:45:41,272 --> 01:45:42,259
He did it for us.

859
01:45:44,131 --> 01:45:46,557
To stop them drawing those gallows
on our front door.

860
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:54,860
It was dad who was drawing them,
I saw him.

861
01:45:57,701 --> 01:45:59,271
We shouldn't tell anyone.

862
01:46:02,789 --> 01:46:06,115
I love him, mama.
I love him.

863
01:47:15,110 --> 01:47:17,468
Our Father

864
01:47:17,469 --> 01:47:19,340
who art in heaven,

865
01:47:19,341 --> 01:47:21,690
hallowed be thy name.

866
01:47:22,759 --> 01:47:23,775
Thy kingdom come.

867
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:26,132
Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

868
01:47:29,036 --> 01:47:31,302
Give us this day our daily bread,

869
01:47:32,986 --> 01:47:35,697
and forgive us our trespasses,

870
01:47:37,429 --> 01:47:42,784
as we forgive those
who trespass against us,

871
01:47:44,433 --> 01:47:47,934
as we forgive those
who trespass against us...

872
01:47:52,941 --> 01:47:56,541
Have you seen all these people?
All Warsaw is here.

873
01:47:56,542 --> 01:47:58,692
It's going to be an incredible funeral.

874
01:47:59,864 --> 01:48:01,408
Josef!

875
01:48:03,242 --> 01:48:05,778
All we've got to do...

876
01:48:07,772 --> 01:48:10,947
is go out, in the streets...

877
01:48:14,036 --> 01:48:16,557
There are half a million people.

878
01:48:18,191 --> 01:48:20,664
No one can stop us.

879
01:48:23,306 --> 01:48:24,990
He was a saint.

880
01:48:26,944 --> 01:48:28,601
But we aren't.

881
01:48:30,733 --> 01:48:32,999
He could forgive.

882
01:48:33,666 --> 01:48:35,643
But we can't.

883
01:48:37,872 --> 01:48:40,808
We... have to fight.

884
01:48:41,291 --> 01:48:45,426
Fight! Yes! Fight!

885
01:48:45,427 --> 01:48:47,037
With our bare fists!

886
01:48:50,101 --> 01:48:51,763
Because they took him away from us!

887
01:48:51,763 --> 01:48:53,218
He's here with us.

888
01:48:53,219 --> 01:48:56,025
Bullshit! He's not here!

889
01:48:56,553 --> 01:48:59,715
And he's not coming back.

890
01:49:01,686 --> 01:49:03,593
It's over.

891
01:49:05,198 --> 01:49:06,541
I...

892
01:49:11,881 --> 01:49:13,900
Leave me alone!

893
01:50:02,088 --> 01:50:04,977
I should have stayed with him!

894
01:50:59,045 --> 01:51:01,339
You're ready?

895
01:51:06,354 --> 01:51:08,418
Your honor...

896
01:51:10,345 --> 01:51:16,277
During the investigation, I described
my attitude towards the late priest as...

897
01:51:16,312 --> 01:51:20,336
as being professionally indifferent.

898
01:51:22,585 --> 01:51:24,808
I was not telling the truth.

899
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:29,661
How could I remain indifferent, when the law
was being broken time and time again

900
01:51:29,661 --> 01:51:32,882
by members of the Roman catholic clergy?

901
01:51:33,153 --> 01:51:34,709
How could I remain indifferent,

902
01:51:34,710 --> 01:51:37,536
when our children were being
incited to rebellion

903
01:51:37,536 --> 01:51:39,424
by these men in black robes?

904
01:51:39,424 --> 01:51:41,123
And what was I supposed to tell my men,

905
01:51:41,124 --> 01:51:43,933
when a priest caught with tons of
anti-government leaflets,

906
01:51:43,934 --> 01:51:47,348
weapons and ammunition, was released
because a bishop had pulled some strings?

907
01:51:49,654 --> 01:51:52,748
Your honor, it was my professional
obligation to try to stop him.

908
01:51:55,353 --> 01:51:57,814
I love my country.

909
01:51:57,837 --> 01:52:01,296
I have dedicated my life
to the strengthening of socialist Poland.

910
01:52:01,796 --> 01:52:05,762
We were on the brink of desaster,
and I felt that acting decisively

911
01:52:05,762 --> 01:52:08,374
against that priest
was the lesser of two evils.

912
01:52:11,807 --> 01:52:18,931
I'm responsible for the pain and the anguish of a
mother who will never see her son again,

913
01:52:18,966 --> 01:52:23,349
but despite everything, I'm a normal man,
with normal instincts,

914
01:52:23,841 --> 01:52:26,575
with normal reactions to evil.

915
01:52:27,411 --> 01:52:30,094
Today I'm deprived of
my dignity and pride,

916
01:52:31,448 --> 01:52:34,139
I've been sentenced to 25 years in prison,

917
01:52:34,139 --> 01:52:35,631
my family is in hiding,

918
01:52:35,632 --> 01:52:38,284
my wife and my son
have had to change their names.

919
01:52:38,284 --> 01:52:40,589
I've been degraded and thrown out of the party!

920
01:52:40,589 --> 01:52:43,737
I'm responsible for the downfall
of people who trusted me.

921
01:52:43,837 --> 01:52:46,384
But if I had to do it all over again,

922
01:52:46,384 --> 01:52:51,150
I know dozens of people in the ministry
would volunteer for the task!

923
01:52:58,580 --> 01:53:04,906
What is important, is that my son
be brought up as a good Pole

924
01:53:04,906 --> 01:53:06,239
and a good communist.

925
01:53:08,999 --> 01:53:12,136
What is important is
that the future is on our side!

926
01:53:32,663 --> 01:53:34,270
That's all.

927
01:53:35,670 --> 01:53:40,037
We'll have a public trial,
open to the foreign press.

928
01:53:40,038 --> 01:53:42,613
We'll turn this whole thing to our advantage.

929
01:54:24,095 --> 01:54:31,169
<i>Father, can you hear
the tolling of the bells </i>

930
01:54:31,170 --> 01:54:38,457
<i>Echo a hundred thousand sons
who wish you well? </i>

931
01:54:38,458 --> 01:54:43,474
<i>Tears will pour
from the Golden Eagle now </i>

932
01:54:43,475 --> 01:54:48,157
<i>He watches as your soul departs</i>

933
01:54:48,158 --> 01:54:53,316
<i>The fields and the sanctuaries
soon will overflow </i>

934
01:54:53,317 --> 01:54:58,629
<i>With the solidarity of hearts</i>

935
01:54:58,630 --> 01:55:03,244
<i>Into our lives you came</i>

936
01:55:03,245 --> 01:55:07,627
<i>With us you will remain</i>

937
01:55:07,627 --> 01:55:10,422
<i>You were given to the fight</i>

938
01:55:10,422 --> 01:55:13,036
<i>To the terror of the night</i>

939
01:55:13,036 --> 01:55:18,473
<i>And the many crimes of Cain</i>
