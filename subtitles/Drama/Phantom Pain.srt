1
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,850
Hey!

2
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:39,849
Chief!

3
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:42,013
Why aren't you drinking?

4
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,847
I don't usually drink.

5
00:02:45,224 --> 00:02:46,589
Why ordered then?

6
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:50,154
Drinking lemon tea every night is a bit suspicious.

7
00:02:50,695 --> 00:02:52,390
Isn't not drinking even more suspicious?

8
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:56,762
There's problem between Rachel and me.

9
00:02:57,568 --> 00:02:58,762
A fight?

10
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:00,563
We never fight.

11
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:02,169
Well, then that's a real problem.

12
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,576
It has to do with me.

13
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,774
Seeing another girl?

14
00:03:15,387 --> 00:03:17,321
Don't tell me you've crossed to the other side?

15
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:22,052
For you.

16
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:24,394
Really?

17
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:31,033
Oh, Chief.

18
00:03:31,202 --> 00:03:32,226
Thanks.

19
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:37,999
It's been five years.

20
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,574
Just to prove that I wasn't suited for her.

21
00:03:44,716 --> 00:03:48,015
Hey, do you know how whiskey came to be?

22
00:03:49,153 --> 00:03:51,121
Once upon a time, the alchemists thought

23
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:52,979
If you put something into a oven to burn it,

24
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:54,647
you can make something new.

25
00:03:54,892 --> 00:03:56,400
They started with gold, silver, bronze, steel.

26
00:03:56,601 --> 00:03:58,054
Afterwards they tried burning anything.

27
00:03:58,228 --> 00:03:59,889
One day they tried burning barley,

28
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:01,496
and ended up with alcohol.

29
00:04:01,732 --> 00:04:04,166
Did they drink it?

30
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:05,932
That's only ethanol.

31
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,567
They used it for disinfection at first.

32
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:10,330
But there wasn't that much to disinfect,

33
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,440
so they kept the leftover in barrels.

34
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:14,052
After storing it for a few years,

35
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,670
one day a person tried drinking it.

36
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:18,841
Whoa, it was sweet.

37
00:04:19,017 --> 00:04:20,507
Since then they started to brew whiskey.

38
00:04:20,952 --> 00:04:22,419
Did you need to go back that far?

39
00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:24,883
That's to prevent any misunderstanding.

40
00:04:26,457 --> 00:04:28,322
It's like investigating a homicide,

41
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:31,392
Each case has many possibilities.

42
00:04:31,628 --> 00:04:34,495
It takes time to nail the real murderer.

43
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,867
In our line of work we need
to have a lot of patience.

44
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:39,627
Can we not treat our women the same?

45
00:04:46,676 --> 00:04:47,700
Thanks... Chief.

46
00:04:55,986 --> 00:04:57,544
What's so good about drinking alcohol anyway?

47
00:04:57,788 --> 00:04:59,916
It's only good because it's hard to drink.

48
00:05:04,962 --> 00:05:07,629
Hello, Merry Christmas.

49
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:11,531
Yes.

50
00:05:12,201 --> 00:05:13,099
Got it.

51
00:08:30,498 --> 00:08:32,056
Officer, I'm scared.

52
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,563
I can't stop talking when I'm scared.

53
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:37,162
Normally, I'm not like that.

54
00:08:49,783 --> 00:08:52,513
Is the toi..toi..toilet leaking?

55
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,478
What?

56
00:08:54,756 --> 00:08:56,690
Is the toilet lea..leaking?

57
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:27,146
Mr. Lai,

58
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:28,230
I'm Inspector Lau Ching Hei

59
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:29,789
from the Hong Kong Island Regional Crime Unit.

60
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,757
The police have evidence to suspect your

61
00:09:31,758 --> 00:09:33,549
involvement in 3 homicide and rape cases.

62
00:09:33,761 --> 00:09:35,091
You are now under arrest.

63
00:09:35,263 --> 00:09:39,165
All you say will be submitted as evidence in court.

64
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:05,580
Inspector, I was just having a bit of fun.

65
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:51,683
Rachel died from blood loss.

66
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:56,190
The coroner said that she had an
abortion a few days prior to her death.

67
00:12:57,095 --> 00:13:00,723
She didn't tell Bong. Nor anyone else.

68
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:04,326
In the following few days,
Bong would not say anything.

69
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:07,062
When he spoke again, his first words were:

70
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:08,835
When the person you love,

71
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:12,799
suddenly disappears from
this world without a sound.

72
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,169
It's absolutely terrifying.

73
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:19,308
So it was with Rachel And her child.

74
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:31,659
Afterwards,
Bong placed a resignation letter on my table.

75
00:13:32,296 --> 00:13:35,823
When we met again,
He become a private investigator

76
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:38,330
and an alcoholic.

77
00:13:52,215 --> 00:13:54,480
This is my father. This is my husband.

78
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:57,743
Call me Hei.

79
00:13:57,955 --> 00:13:58,784
Sit down.

80
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:00,861
In the past,

81
00:14:00,862 --> 00:14:02,482
it used to be about fighting
crime and protecting the public.

82
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:04,679
Now, the superiors only look at the crime rate,

83
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,025
not the number or cases solved.

84
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:09,063
So now, we are doing more publicity
than investigating crimes.

85
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:11,000
Feels like any other job.

86
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:13,032
That's good. It's safer that way.

87
00:14:13,302 --> 00:14:14,895
I'm happy that my daughter marry you.

88
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:21,005
Cheers.

89
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:22,434
Cheers.

90
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:36,523
It must be hard for Bong to see Rachel die.

91
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:39,922
You better spend more time with him.

92
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:41,924
We see each other every week.

93
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:44,595
I even refer cases to him sometimes.

94
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:53,968
You said it's hard to find, so I asked Bong to.

95
00:14:54,511 --> 00:14:56,445
He gave it to us for our wedding gift.

96
00:14:58,014 --> 00:15:00,538
I've asked many people.
They all didn't want to sell theirs.

97
00:15:01,383 --> 00:15:02,681
How did he manage to get it?

98
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:03,909
I've asked him to meet up with us tonight.

99
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,212
You can ask him then.

100
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,851
What are you guys up to?

101
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:12,824
Guess...

102
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,762
Thank you.

103
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,028
Both you and your father are strange,

104
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:21,232
You can stay silent for the whole night.

105
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:27,941
What is it?
Why keep it here?

106
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,311
It's precious.
I won it in a competition!

107
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,604
It's priceless.

108
00:15:33,982 --> 00:15:36,314
The problem is that I don't like you
leaving the gun in the house.

109
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,185
Didn't you say that you were a journalist in Iraq?

110
00:15:42,424 --> 00:15:43,686
How can you be scared of guns?

111
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:46,955
But there's no one fighting a war here.

112
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:00,038
I am ...

113
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:02,538
A terrorist!
Hahaha. Are you scared?

114
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:14,985
Two months ago,

115
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:17,989
I found ten or so people
with that model of camera.

116
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,824
So I went to ask them one by one,

117
00:16:22,163 --> 00:16:26,566
Everyday I would go and harass them.

118
00:16:26,968 --> 00:16:28,230
Eventually,

119
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:30,702
In the end, there was one named Kwan

120
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:31,997
agreed to sell me his camera.

121
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:33,864
Why was he willing to sell it?

122
00:16:34,108 --> 00:16:36,702
He was in his 90's. It didn't matter to him.

123
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,343
Can you introduce him to me?

124
00:16:38,545 --> 00:16:39,876
I want to take his pictures to thank him.

125
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:41,946
He died two weeks ago.

126
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:47,387
We plan to take the team out

127
00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:48,886
for a banquet two weeks later.

128
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,790
Good. Let's get a few drinks to celebrate.

129
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:54,688
Beer girl. Come here!

130
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,319
Coming.

131
00:16:57,532 --> 00:16:58,794
How many bottles?

132
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:00,864
Another round of whiskey, please.

133
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:04,229
No whiskey.

134
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,968
No?

135
00:17:08,575 --> 00:17:10,702
What sort of attitude is that?
What company are you with?

136
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,173
Is this how you treat your customers?

137
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,211
The brand is right here.
Can't you see?

138
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,942
We all need friends in life.

139
00:17:19,253 --> 00:17:22,485
You've called me over dozens of times.
Each time it's whiskey.

140
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,247
Don't you know what I'm selling?

141
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:27,227
No, it's just that when I drink beer, I'll ...

142
00:17:28,295 --> 00:17:30,388
If I drink beer, I'll ...

143
00:17:33,568 --> 00:17:34,761
Hey, what are you doing?

144
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:39,266
Afterwards, Bong continued
to investigate Rachel's suicide.

145
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:41,668
He spent several months
and spoke to many people.

146
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:44,838
Months later, he finally found out

147
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:47,272
on that Christmas eve,

148
00:17:47,514 --> 00:17:49,071
Rachel had been in this bar for hours.

149
00:17:59,627 --> 00:18:03,119
For three hours,
No one knew whom she's waiting for.

150
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:05,093
Only that she had 4 glasses of whiskey

151
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:06,493
and never spoke to anyone.

152
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:11,095
Then she went home and killed herself.

153
00:18:13,973 --> 00:18:15,373
When things like this happen,

154
00:18:15,575 --> 00:18:18,136
most people would choose to escape.

155
00:18:18,578 --> 00:18:20,307
But I know Bong wouldn't.

156
00:18:20,547 --> 00:18:22,173
He has to know the reason.

157
00:18:22,482 --> 00:18:24,609
He won't quit until he finds out.

158
00:18:25,718 --> 00:18:27,277
It might seem meaningless.

159
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:30,455
But to him, this is the only way out.

160
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,655
Excuse me, Miss?

161
00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:37,624
Have you seen this woman

162
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:40,362
here?

163
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:43,866
Yes, two nights ago.

164
00:18:45,337 --> 00:18:46,396
What?

165
00:18:47,806 --> 00:18:49,104
Where?

166
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:52,607
Just before we got into bed together

167
00:18:52,812 --> 00:18:54,007
two nights ago.

168
00:19:02,923 --> 00:19:03,912
Susan.

169
00:22:06,404 --> 00:22:09,237
I don't know what's with me,
I always seem to want to sleep.

170
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,598
'Cos you're happy.

171
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:50,266
Are you awake?

172
00:22:55,717 --> 00:22:58,652
I've slept for the night.
Consider it rental for the room.

173
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:07,621
But you've slept for 3 nights.

174
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:12,861
You're right... I'm sorry.

175
00:23:33,122 --> 00:23:34,521
Where you working tonight?

176
00:23:38,127 --> 00:23:40,253
Taiping Road.

177
00:23:40,596 --> 00:23:42,119
"Beer Bottle Bar"

178
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:46,794
The more they drink, the less they cheat.

179
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,305
I don't go to that area often.

180
00:23:54,342 --> 00:23:55,570
What are you worried about?

181
00:23:57,212 --> 00:23:58,770
I'm not asking you to come.

182
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,478
I'll call you.

183
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:05,884
What for?

184
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:12,393
Call me whenever you want.

185
00:24:12,595 --> 00:24:14,153
We are buddies after all.

186
00:24:14,397 --> 00:24:15,921
But...

187
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:20,230
I want to...

188
00:24:20,436 --> 00:24:21,403
increase the price.

189
00:24:21,971 --> 00:24:22,960
OK.

190
00:24:23,873 --> 00:24:25,737
Buddies ought to be fair to each other.

191
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:29,844
Yeah, buddy.

192
00:24:30,478 --> 00:24:32,673
Let's go, buddy.

193
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,441
Bong, I'm taking statement.
I'll call you back.

194
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,727
Go on.

195
00:25:57,564 --> 00:26:01,226
Mr. Wong. Mr. Wong.

196
00:26:02,469 --> 00:26:07,599
Mr. Wong. Mr. Wong.

197
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:18,346
Help. Help.

198
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:23,883
You know what adultery is?

199
00:26:24,091 --> 00:26:25,559
You call these pictures evidence?

200
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:27,724
What kind of detective are you?

201
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:32,025
Don't worry.

202
00:26:32,298 --> 00:26:33,993
It's 99%

203
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:36,329
sure win at court.

204
00:26:37,237 --> 00:26:39,205
Ask your Solicitor Lau if you don't trust me.

205
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:41,201
I want 100% sure.

206
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:43,266
I don't know how Solicitor Lau could've hired you.

207
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:47,375
You're fired.
Forget about the final payment.

208
00:26:51,518 --> 00:26:54,577
Then,
the pictures where you're kissing Solicitor Lau.

209
00:26:54,788 --> 00:26:56,550
should I give them to you or him?

210
00:26:57,691 --> 00:27:01,451
Hello, Lau?
I'm coming to talk to you later.

211
00:27:02,562 --> 00:27:03,687
How much do you want?

212
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,030
Just give me the remaining amount..

213
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:10,931
If you try anything,
I'll sue you till you lose your license.

214
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,334
Sue?
I never had one to begin with.

215
00:27:23,015 --> 00:27:24,244
Put the bottle down.

216
00:27:37,863 --> 00:27:38,761
Where's Chief?

217
00:27:39,232 --> 00:27:40,630
There's something I want to see you about.

218
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:43,534
I want you to look into my father's case.

219
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,195
This one?

220
00:27:46,472 --> 00:27:48,235
Looks like the police have
already closed the case.

221
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:50,731
I don't know either of them.

222
00:27:51,477 --> 00:27:53,035
Neither did my dad.

223
00:27:54,313 --> 00:27:56,110
I don't get it.

224
00:27:57,249 --> 00:27:59,514
Man would never open the door to a strangers.

225
00:28:00,353 --> 00:28:03,845
Before he would open the door for anyone,
he would ask my father first.

226
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,617
Could it be that these criminals knew Man.

227
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,590
Or Man opened the door

228
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,795
by mistake?

229
00:28:16,634 --> 00:28:18,068
Even for my friends,

230
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:21,798
Man would get my father to have a look first.

231
00:28:23,242 --> 00:28:25,574
Because of this, we argued many times.

232
00:28:26,145 --> 00:28:29,012
I think the real murderer knows my dad.

233
00:28:29,515 --> 00:28:32,381
These two are just scapegoats.

234
00:28:36,254 --> 00:28:38,984
My mother died when I was four.

235
00:28:39,191 --> 00:28:41,056
I never really got to know my dad.

236
00:28:44,229 --> 00:28:46,322
I left home when I was 18.

237
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:49,398
It could be, I just wanted to know

238
00:28:49,701 --> 00:28:51,464
exactly what sort of person my father was.

239
00:28:53,104 --> 00:28:55,072
You'll help me, won't you?

240
00:28:59,978 --> 00:29:01,775
Actually, I really want to help you.

241
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,774
But this is a homicide, a big case.

242
00:29:05,116 --> 00:29:06,378
And I'm no longer a cop.

243
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:11,777
I thought you'd understand.

244
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,859
It's similar to why you always stay in this place?

245
00:30:02,706 --> 00:30:04,401
Do I need to call an ambulance for you?

246
00:30:07,612 --> 00:30:09,511
You're going to drink?
You must be asking for death?

247
00:30:15,385 --> 00:30:16,546
You've agreed to help Susan?

248
00:30:20,723 --> 00:30:21,815
What do you think?

249
00:30:24,661 --> 00:30:25,686
How about you?

250
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:30,566
She raised a good point.

251
00:30:31,503 --> 00:30:33,561
The one about Man not opening
the door to strangers?

252
00:30:35,106 --> 00:30:36,595
You believe that there was
a third person involved?

253
00:30:40,277 --> 00:30:43,143
I just feel that, a couple of adult men

254
00:30:43,347 --> 00:30:46,679
being afraid to open the door to strangers,
is a bit strange.

255
00:30:48,484 --> 00:30:49,713
Where will you start?

256
00:30:51,722 --> 00:30:53,211
Who's in charge of this case?

257
00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:54,219
Tsui the Bullshitter.

258
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:55,990
Tsui the Bullshitter?

259
00:30:56,594 --> 00:30:58,459
Can't help it. I am a suspect myself.

260
00:30:59,662 --> 00:31:01,790
Susan's dad left a lot of inheritance.

261
00:31:03,801 --> 00:31:06,326
Then actually, did you do it?

262
00:31:08,305 --> 00:31:09,896
Murder charge is not to be taken lightly,
Officer!

263
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:15,206
I'd like you to get me some information.

264
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:17,977
I also would like you to help me with something.

265
00:31:18,715 --> 00:31:21,513
Susan's been acting weird lately.

266
00:31:21,717 --> 00:31:23,708
Saying that she's being followed.

267
00:31:24,486 --> 00:31:27,284
If she's not calling the police,
she's calling the complaints dept.

268
00:31:27,991 --> 00:31:29,516
The doctor said that it's only a stress.

269
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,423
They started her on medication
but she won't take it.

270
00:31:32,463 --> 00:31:33,724
Please help me to persuade her.

271
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,067
That's easy.
Drink and be happy.

272
00:31:39,268 --> 00:31:41,168
The doctor said not to mix
alcohol with the medication.

273
00:31:42,339 --> 00:31:45,171
Oh crap.
She drank the whole bottle that day.

274
00:31:46,376 --> 00:31:47,706
You're kidding?

275
00:31:51,514 --> 00:31:52,811
Sorry.

276
00:33:58,105 --> 00:33:58,935
What's wrong?

277
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:17,954
Let's eat.

278
00:34:22,095 --> 00:34:23,027
I want to move.

279
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,484
I'll talk to the management office.

280
00:34:27,585 --> 00:34:29,133
Do you find me annoying?

281
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:38,038
I told you there's someone following me,
but you don't believe me.

282
00:34:38,547 --> 00:34:41,175
I told you my dad died under suspicious situation,
and you also don't believe me.

283
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:45,483
Do you just think that I'm lying, or that I'm crazy?

284
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,383
Of course, I trust you.

285
00:34:54,862 --> 00:34:56,453
You are my wife.

286
00:34:59,966 --> 00:35:01,457
I hope you trust me too.

287
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:04,134
If there's no trust, then this family will be over.

288
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:08,040
I never had a family when I was young.
I don't want to lose this one.

289
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,881
Hello? Hello?

290
00:36:06,382 --> 00:36:08,356
The things you've done,
be ready for the consequences.

291
00:36:21,748 --> 00:36:23,146
This is the living room.

292
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,642
That night, Chow's body

293
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:28,046
was discovered here.

294
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,713
His butler, Man was found in the study.

295
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:35,184
The CSI team dusted the place
and took pictures under UV light.

296
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:43,193
Chow's left shoulder had knife wounds,

297
00:36:43,403 --> 00:36:46,497
And there was repeated blunt trauma to his head.
It was the cause of death.

298
00:36:46,773 --> 00:36:48,866
The murder weapon was a brass Buddha statue.

299
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:52,243
On the left side of Man's abdomen and face,
there were knife wounds.

300
00:36:52,512 --> 00:36:55,537
His head also suffered blunt trauma.
And was also the case of death.

301
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,542
On the floor, 1 feet 10 inches from the
entrance had Man's bloodstains.

302
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:01,710
It appears that Man was the
one who opened the door.

303
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:05,119
The killers attacked immediately after entering.

304
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:08,451
That is the sequence of events
according to the report.

305
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,009
What's wrong, Man?

306
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:42,309
Accounting for the missing property

307
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:44,173
comes to about $3.87 Million.

308
00:39:44,347 --> 00:39:46,076
It must have been a premeditated
murder and robbery.

309
00:39:46,282 --> 00:39:47,873
These pictures were all taken in Macau?

310
00:39:48,617 --> 00:39:51,212
Chow was from Macau,
and had a transport business there.

311
00:39:51,688 --> 00:39:53,212
He migrated to Hong Kong afterwards.

312
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,229
It's Tsui the Bullshitter.

313
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,868
That's right, this is his case.

314
00:40:06,236 --> 00:40:07,430
Why would he pass it on to you?

315
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:10,403
He has a mistress.
He wouldn't dare not to give it to me.

316
00:40:10,607 --> 00:40:11,904
Mistress?

317
00:40:12,608 --> 00:40:14,599
His wife Shirley is smart.

318
00:40:14,777 --> 00:40:16,802
She's so clever, how could she not know?

319
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,912
Shirley is his mistress.

320
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:19,877
His wife emigrated to Australia in 1997.

321
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:26,352
Tsui, Bong is all yours.

322
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,787
Inspector Bullshit.

323
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:38,327
What's so funny?

324
00:40:39,367 --> 00:40:41,393
How's the weather in Australia?

325
00:40:42,905 --> 00:40:45,703
You find that funny? Listen up.

326
00:40:45,873 --> 00:40:47,670
If I didn't pass this case to your buddy,

327
00:40:47,943 --> 00:40:48,807
then you would have had nothing.

328
00:40:49,044 --> 00:40:49,511
OK.

329
00:40:49,612 --> 00:40:50,636
Stay away.

330
00:40:51,613 --> 00:40:53,547
The lock is connected to the security company.

331
00:40:53,749 --> 00:40:56,150
The alarm goes off if the code is not re-entered.

332
00:40:56,753 --> 00:40:59,119
Hey, the alarm didn't go off that day.

333
00:40:59,556 --> 00:41:00,613
So?

334
00:41:01,758 --> 00:41:04,454
The code must have been
used after they entered.

335
00:41:05,662 --> 00:41:06,959
So?

336
00:41:08,765 --> 00:41:12,131
So the two killers knew Chow or Man.

337
00:41:12,334 --> 00:41:14,461
Or the killers might have known the code.

338
00:41:15,704 --> 00:41:17,569
Didn't you read my report?

339
00:41:18,373 --> 00:41:20,170
It wasn't mentioned in your report.

340
00:41:30,118 --> 00:41:31,608
How much does it cost to hire a butler?

341
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,185
$10,000 to $20,000 a month.

342
00:41:33,388 --> 00:41:34,788
He treated the butler quite well.

343
00:41:35,023 --> 00:41:37,617
Man has worked here for over 20 years.

344
00:41:37,826 --> 00:41:39,589
This huge house was managed by him alone.

345
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:40,793
Sometimes he acted as the chauffeur too.

346
00:41:40,963 --> 00:41:43,055
Occasionally,
a maid would come to clean the house.

347
00:41:43,231 --> 00:41:45,222
It was actually the maid who found the bodies.

348
00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:48,535
Initially I though that Man had it up to here,

349
00:41:48,704 --> 00:41:51,638
couldn't take it any more and
committed a murder suicide.

350
00:41:58,748 --> 00:42:01,739
That morning there was a jogger there,

351
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,317
Who saw 2 men running over there.

352
00:42:04,553 --> 00:42:07,317
No one saw what car they took.

353
00:42:07,623 --> 00:42:09,090
Want to see their hideout?

354
00:42:09,258 --> 00:42:10,088
OK.

355
00:42:12,695 --> 00:42:15,424
Sir Lau, the number you were asking about.
The call came from a convenience store.

356
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,756
Located in Bai Hua Street.

357
00:42:17,732 --> 00:42:20,360
9:30 pm last night,

358
00:42:21,003 --> 00:42:23,470
I wasn't on duty.
Are you investigating a case?

359
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:24,731
Just a theft case.

360
00:42:25,172 --> 00:42:27,697
There's been a rise in pickpockets lately.

361
00:42:27,877 --> 00:42:31,544
I see.
I was sure that I had $40 in my pocket yesterday.

362
00:43:12,053 --> 00:43:14,716
Wong and Keung were both drug addicts.

363
00:43:14,922 --> 00:43:16,321
Both have criminal records.

364
00:43:16,623 --> 00:43:19,820
Just minor cases like thefts.

365
00:43:20,861 --> 00:43:22,589
Wong rented the house.

366
00:43:22,763 --> 00:43:25,630
He put poison in Keung's drink.

367
00:43:25,766 --> 00:43:28,394
Keung noticed something
wrong after having a drink,

368
00:43:28,601 --> 00:43:32,094
He pulled a knife and stabbed Wong.

369
00:43:35,275 --> 00:43:39,645
The knife is 7 inches long,
the same one used on Chow.

370
00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:48,517
In face of millions,
who could control themselves?

371
00:43:58,631 --> 00:44:00,428
Did the cops bust the door open?

372
00:44:01,967 --> 00:44:03,936
This door opens outwards,

373
00:44:04,138 --> 00:44:06,038
how could we break it inwards?

374
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,674
You pull to open the door.

375
00:44:09,877 --> 00:44:13,643
The door was locked.
And was just broken by you.

376
00:44:13,914 --> 00:44:17,009
They locked themselves in to kill each other.
Do you understand, super detective?

377
00:44:43,376 --> 00:44:45,468
Have you seen any suspicious
people pass through that day?

378
00:44:45,645 --> 00:44:46,703
Yeah, going that way.

379
00:44:54,286 --> 00:44:55,014
Back to the hilltop.

380
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,240
From the hilltop to Li Yu Men

381
00:47:05,415 --> 00:47:08,976
is at least 1.5 hours with 3 changeovers.

382
00:47:10,354 --> 00:47:13,290
You mean a third guy picked them up,

383
00:47:13,624 --> 00:47:16,184
and after they did the murder,
returned them to the Li Yu Men,

384
00:47:16,394 --> 00:47:17,953
and then killed them as well.

385
00:47:18,296 --> 00:47:20,025
Perhaps they drove themselves.

386
00:47:21,165 --> 00:47:23,396
So there's no third guy?

387
00:47:25,304 --> 00:47:27,533
Keung stabbed Wong very precisely.

388
00:47:28,405 --> 00:47:29,805
He didn't seem to be poisoned.

389
00:47:32,677 --> 00:47:34,644
So you're saying that there
was a 3rd person then?

390
00:47:34,844 --> 00:47:36,403
He could have just been lucky.

391
00:47:37,847 --> 00:47:39,371
Or maybe, he really was good with knives.

392
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:42,377
So, you're saying that anything is possible?

393
00:47:43,554 --> 00:47:44,452
That's possible.

394
00:47:46,524 --> 00:47:49,515
Police said the door was locked from inside.

395
00:47:49,693 --> 00:47:52,754
So after he killed them, how did he escape?

396
00:47:53,129 --> 00:47:53,960
The air-conditioner.

397
00:48:01,404 --> 00:48:02,427
Damn it.

398
00:48:02,939 --> 00:48:04,303
A bit far-fetched?

399
00:48:06,977 --> 00:48:08,274
Whiskey on rocks?

400
00:48:09,312 --> 00:48:10,438
Do you have beer?

401
00:48:11,814 --> 00:48:13,509
I thought that you don't drink beer.

402
00:48:15,186 --> 00:48:16,619
I'm thirsty.

403
00:48:17,622 --> 00:48:20,318
Hong Kong is so hot lately.

404
00:48:20,825 --> 00:48:23,521
It's almost winter. Isn't it abnormal?

405
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:25,855
Besides, it's very polluted.

406
00:48:30,734 --> 00:48:31,564
What's wrong?

407
00:48:33,503 --> 00:48:35,630
Chief said that you shouldn't drink alcohol.

408
00:48:36,439 --> 00:48:39,430
When talking about their own wives,

409
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:42,270
do all men make them sound
like crazy old women?

410
00:48:42,779 --> 00:48:44,804
Oh, don't worry about him. Come.

411
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:48,816
Shirley? Haven't seen her for a while.

412
00:48:49,019 --> 00:48:51,852
Trust me. I will introduce her to a good man.

413
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:53,022
How's our daughter?

414
00:48:53,523 --> 00:48:54,581
What's next?

415
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:58,360
I'll start investigating the victims.

416
00:48:59,062 --> 00:49:00,722
That's your dad and Man.

417
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:17,072
Hey Bong.

418
00:49:23,653 --> 00:49:24,585
Go.

419
00:49:42,471 --> 00:49:43,768
Hei has kept something important here.

420
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:44,564
Let me.

421
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:06,524
It's dangerous, get out quickly.

422
00:51:01,182 --> 00:51:05,347
This is a very difficult matter,
I don't think it will be resolved easily.

423
00:51:05,686 --> 00:51:07,517
How could it be so coincidental
that I ran into the suspect.

424
00:51:07,755 --> 00:51:09,551
But I let him slip away.

425
00:51:10,557 --> 00:51:11,489
You saw the suspect?

426
00:51:11,692 --> 00:51:12,590
Yes.

427
00:51:13,059 --> 00:51:13,957
Did you recognize him?

428
00:51:14,161 --> 00:51:15,424
Of course not.

429
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:34,273
Sorry, I should have believed you.

430
00:51:42,689 --> 00:51:43,678
I'm glad you're OK.

431
00:51:58,973 --> 00:51:59,997
Bong,

432
00:52:01,141 --> 00:52:02,609
are you OK?

433
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,241
I'm fine. You?

434
00:52:08,448 --> 00:52:09,848
Why don't you take Susan home first!

435
00:52:10,117 --> 00:52:11,343
I'll call you in a couple of days.

436
00:52:11,517 --> 00:52:12,507
Let's go.

437
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,538
So actually, did you do it?

438
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:19,783
Murder charge is not to be taken lightly,
Officer.

439
00:54:17,241 --> 00:54:19,106
Mister, did you want a beer?

440
00:55:38,709 --> 00:55:40,009
Another 2 dozen for table 3.

441
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:02,135
Hey, come back. Sit down.

442
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:04,247
Sit down.

443
00:56:04,481 --> 00:56:07,075
No. You might expose your identity.

444
00:56:07,984 --> 00:56:10,214
Shit. Think you're an undercover?

445
00:56:11,155 --> 00:56:12,281
Give him a glass of piss.

446
00:56:13,623 --> 00:56:14,612
Come closer.

447
00:56:18,361 --> 00:56:19,293
Cheers.

448
00:56:21,699 --> 00:56:23,290
You can go now. Scram.

449
00:56:24,067 --> 00:56:24,623
What? Go?

450
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,734
Go. Take your beer with you.

451
00:56:27,904 --> 00:56:28,962
I'll call you.

452
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,278
What happened to your head?

453
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:40,110
What do you mean by what's wrong?

454
00:56:41,586 --> 00:56:43,645
The customer got a bit over excited.

455
00:56:44,422 --> 00:56:45,855
What's up? Did you come to see me?

456
00:56:46,757 --> 00:56:48,554
No, I came to have a chat with my friend.

457
00:56:52,263 --> 00:56:53,730
What time do you finish tonight?

458
00:56:53,964 --> 00:56:54,988
What the hell's it to you?

459
00:57:04,808 --> 00:57:07,140
A week before he died,
Man called this number.

460
00:57:07,711 --> 00:57:09,303
Does it ring a bell?

461
00:57:11,081 --> 00:57:12,070
No.

462
00:57:14,417 --> 00:57:15,111
That's all?

463
00:57:23,859 --> 00:57:25,157
How did you meet Chief?

464
00:57:26,362 --> 00:57:27,589
Hasn't he ever told you?

465
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:33,802
I lost my camera at the mall once.

466
00:57:34,203 --> 00:57:35,829
Hei found it for me.

467
00:57:36,305 --> 00:57:38,466
After I invited him out for a dinner to thank him.

468
00:57:38,741 --> 00:57:42,701
I discovered that we had many,
many things in common.

469
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,875
Before we met,

470
00:57:45,114 --> 00:57:48,050
We had seen the same film in the same cinema,

471
00:57:48,218 --> 00:57:50,448
ordered the same dish at the same restaurant,

472
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:53,783
even took the same flight to the same place.

473
00:57:54,891 --> 00:57:57,290
Is Hei involved in this case?

474
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:59,552
No.

475
00:58:01,063 --> 00:58:02,963
Just want to know how these things begin.

476
00:58:03,966 --> 00:58:05,228
Never tried it before?

477
00:58:06,569 --> 00:58:07,695
Can't remember.

478
00:58:09,939 --> 00:58:12,635
Last time I went to the US,
he took me to the airport.

479
00:58:12,809 --> 00:58:16,300
Then he proposed to me at
the Los Angeles airport.

480
00:58:16,579 --> 00:58:18,012
I thought it was your idea.

481
00:58:20,049 --> 00:58:22,176
I just helped him find a flight that
would get there earlier than you.

482
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:24,915
Let's have dinner.

483
00:58:26,855 --> 00:58:28,287
Oh, you're here.

484
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:30,457
Just came to have a look. What's this?

485
00:58:30,592 --> 00:58:31,456
It's soup.

486
00:58:31,893 --> 00:58:32,860
Soup?

487
00:58:34,128 --> 00:58:36,289
You take this. I'll get another one.

488
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:43,336
Oxtail soup, good for your kidneys.

489
00:59:04,325 --> 00:59:05,690
She knows.

490
00:59:06,527 --> 00:59:07,459
About what?

491
00:59:08,596 --> 00:59:10,496
Susan knows that you put
medication into the soup.

492
00:59:12,801 --> 00:59:14,666
She says nothing,
because she doesn't want you to worry.

493
00:59:17,306 --> 00:59:18,135
Really?

494
00:59:26,515 --> 00:59:28,483
I checked out Wong's family today.

495
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:32,448
He only has a 70 year old
mother with Alzheimer's.

496
00:59:32,954 --> 00:59:34,386
She can't even hold up a bowl.

497
00:59:36,189 --> 00:59:37,087
What about Keung?

498
00:59:42,562 --> 00:59:44,792
How about dropping him home?

499
00:59:52,675 --> 00:59:54,165
I checked Man's call record.

500
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:56,470
Before the attack,
there were 2 calls to his phone.

501
00:59:56,811 --> 00:59:59,439
It's registered under Keung.
Here's the address.

502
01:00:03,618 --> 01:00:04,607
What about this guy?

503
01:00:07,821 --> 01:00:09,221
Let him sleep.

504
01:00:36,349 --> 01:00:39,113
October 27, the day before the murder.

505
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:46,319
I've checked the call record.

506
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:49,720
The last number dialed was 23365195.

507
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:51,227
That's Chow's home number.

508
01:01:02,577 --> 01:01:04,568
Keung was also from Macau.

509
01:01:06,712 --> 01:01:08,771
Maybe he knew Chow.

510
01:01:11,517 --> 01:01:12,313
Maybe.

511
01:01:18,992 --> 01:01:21,051
I think there's a third guy.

512
01:01:23,864 --> 01:01:27,162
Perhaps he's someone we both know?

513
01:01:38,411 --> 01:01:39,036
No idea.

514
01:01:53,493 --> 01:01:54,255
Bong.

515
01:02:17,082 --> 01:02:18,140
No.

516
01:03:58,517 --> 01:03:59,609
Police. Freeze.

517
01:04:00,818 --> 01:04:01,716
Let go of him.

518
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:07,750
Bong, you all right?

519
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,043
Police.

520
01:04:31,683 --> 01:04:32,775
Sorry.

521
01:04:45,396 --> 01:04:46,828
So, there's really a third guy.

522
01:04:46,996 --> 01:04:49,158
Why didn't he flee after the attack?
Why would he come back to his place?

523
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:55,995
What happened to your head?

524
01:04:58,140 --> 01:04:59,129
No big deal.

525
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:01,936
The customer got a bit over excited.

526
01:05:08,987 --> 01:05:10,078
Is this another one of your problems?

527
01:05:13,558 --> 01:05:14,923
Do you want me to go over to help?

528
01:05:16,694 --> 01:05:18,489
No need. It's just work.

529
01:05:28,672 --> 01:05:29,866
What am I doing here?

530
01:05:30,774 --> 01:05:32,366
We came out for a drink after dinner.

531
01:05:32,643 --> 01:05:34,075
You collapsed after two rounds.

532
01:05:35,712 --> 01:05:37,202
I can't remember a thing.

533
01:05:40,684 --> 01:05:41,912
What happened to your head?

534
01:05:44,755 --> 01:05:46,484
After you got drunk,
you smashed a bottle on me.

535
01:05:47,391 --> 01:05:48,379
That bad ...

536
01:05:49,392 --> 01:05:50,653
then, I'm really sorry.

537
01:05:50,826 --> 01:05:51,587
Don't worry.

538
01:05:52,461 --> 01:05:55,726
Check this license plate for me.
Might be a lead.

539
01:05:57,733 --> 01:05:59,325
Thanks.

540
01:05:59,535 --> 01:06:01,093
Let me buy you a drink.

541
01:06:01,671 --> 01:06:03,468
- Beer girl.
- Coming!

542
01:06:20,356 --> 01:06:21,414
The license plate has been tempered.

543
01:06:21,724 --> 01:06:25,251
The real number is GG8165.

544
01:06:26,629 --> 01:06:27,960
A phone was found.

545
01:06:28,197 --> 01:06:31,928
The last number dialed was 23589991.

546
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:44,302
October 29 was not a special festival.

547
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,041
But someone donated $10,000 to the temple.

548
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:50,309
That's why I remembered.

549
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:53,009
Did you meet this donor?

550
01:06:53,188 --> 01:06:55,452
No, he just left an envelope.

551
01:06:56,124 --> 01:06:58,251
Who is this man Fu?

552
01:06:58,626 --> 01:06:59,684
Ancestor.

553
01:07:10,272 --> 01:07:12,867
Wai Shu was on duty that day.

554
01:07:13,042 --> 01:07:14,942
She remembers that person.

555
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:16,871
Are you Wai Shu? Can you remember him?

556
01:07:17,046 --> 01:07:18,775
Yes, he is a man.

557
01:07:18,948 --> 01:07:21,678
How tall was he? How big?

558
01:07:22,585 --> 01:07:23,882
Look?

559
01:07:28,123 --> 01:07:30,250
If I could see clearly, then I would know.

560
01:07:30,426 --> 01:07:33,326
My eyes are failing. Everyone knows.

561
01:07:33,561 --> 01:07:35,996
I'm going blind, sir.

562
01:07:55,316 --> 01:07:57,647
Chow's time of death is 5:30 am.

563
01:07:57,818 --> 01:07:58,842
At 6:58 am

564
01:07:59,053 --> 01:08:00,987
Keung called the temple.

565
01:08:01,188 --> 01:08:02,713
At 7:10 am

566
01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:04,855
a snapshot of Keung's speeding car

567
01:08:05,125 --> 01:08:06,649
was taken on its way to the temple.

568
01:08:06,894 --> 01:08:09,727
Keung reached the temple at 7:20 am,

569
01:08:09,965 --> 01:08:12,558
stayed for 15 minutes and left.

570
01:08:12,735 --> 01:08:15,396
The autopsy report is as follows:

571
01:08:15,571 --> 01:08:18,164
Keung and Wong's time of death was

572
01:08:18,374 --> 01:08:20,433
between 6 am to 9 am.

573
01:08:21,143 --> 01:08:23,202
But the CCTV on the main road

574
01:08:23,411 --> 01:08:26,005
shows that Keung leaving the temple

575
01:08:26,213 --> 01:08:27,976
and crossing the road.

576
01:08:28,683 --> 01:08:31,617
Across the road is a bus stop.

577
01:08:31,785 --> 01:08:33,446
There is a bus that goes to Li Yu Men.

578
01:08:33,654 --> 01:08:35,315
It takes 1 hour.

579
01:08:35,522 --> 01:08:38,150
That means their time of death

580
01:08:38,392 --> 01:08:39,655
should be around 8:30 am.

581
01:08:39,828 --> 01:08:43,058
I knew from the start that
there was more to this case.

582
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:45,164
Follow it up, people.

583
01:08:49,737 --> 01:08:51,067
What are you waiting for!

584
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:56,569
What's wrong with him?

585
01:08:56,777 --> 01:08:58,074
He lost his handcuffs.

586
01:08:58,779 --> 01:09:00,110
He can just buy another pair.

587
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:01,246
Out of stock.

588
01:09:10,357 --> 01:09:14,624
Why do you think Keung would leave
Wong to go to the temple alone?

589
01:09:15,496 --> 01:09:18,953
Why would he be so stupid to give
Wong the opportunity to poison him?

590
01:09:21,502 --> 01:09:25,700
It's several million. If it were me,
I would split the money first.

591
01:09:27,342 --> 01:09:28,865
Maybe some things are more
important than money.

592
01:09:35,349 --> 01:09:37,180
I think I need to go to Macau.

593
01:09:57,838 --> 01:09:58,565
Why are you here?

594
01:09:59,505 --> 01:10:00,402
Looking for you.

595
01:10:00,806 --> 01:10:01,670
What for?

596
01:10:02,274 --> 01:10:03,367
Let's go to Macau.

597
01:10:03,643 --> 01:10:04,439
Don't mess around.

598
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:05,702
I'll pay you.

599
01:10:08,915 --> 01:10:10,041
Go to hell.

600
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:11,747
That's not what I meant.

601
01:10:17,324 --> 01:10:18,586
What the hell do you want?

602
01:10:21,962 --> 01:10:23,554
You want sex?

603
01:10:24,264 --> 01:10:26,797
You want sex? Come on.

604
01:10:26,934 --> 01:10:28,565
Is that what you want?

605
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:31,432
OK, come on.

606
01:10:32,204 --> 01:10:33,671
Just do it right here.

607
01:10:34,373 --> 01:10:35,431
Come on.

608
01:10:36,742 --> 01:10:37,834
Come.

609
01:10:38,945 --> 01:10:40,412
I've been thinking of you.

610
01:10:50,456 --> 01:10:53,289
You only ... only ...

611
01:10:54,493 --> 01:10:57,462
You only think of me when you get drunk?

612
01:10:59,398 --> 01:11:01,992
I've been sober for the past few days,
and I'm still was thinking about you.

613
01:11:03,435 --> 01:11:04,834
What about the next few days?

614
01:11:06,338 --> 01:11:08,499
Can't I just have a conversation with you?

615
01:11:11,577 --> 01:11:14,204
No ... I really want to talk to you

616
01:11:14,347 --> 01:11:16,405
But I'm not sure if I can love you.

617
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:19,477
Can we?

618
01:11:22,054 --> 01:11:23,180
Forget it.

619
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:24,979
What's wrong with you?

620
01:11:25,591 --> 01:11:28,492
I still haven't asked you what you want to do.

621
01:11:28,761 --> 01:11:31,525
You just like imagining things.

622
01:11:31,765 --> 01:11:35,290
You don't know what you want.

623
01:11:37,769 --> 01:11:38,827
I know.

624
01:11:40,705 --> 01:11:41,831
I know.

625
01:11:44,275 --> 01:11:47,676
Hey,
can you not give me money in the future?

626
01:11:47,812 --> 01:11:49,109
I'm not...

627
01:11:49,281 --> 01:11:51,043
I'm really not that sort of girl.

628
01:12:58,982 --> 01:13:00,176
Stealing wine?

629
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:04,484
No.

630
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:08,683
Red wine OK?

631
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,701
You know why people like drinking alcohol?

632
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:22,796
Why?

633
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,798
Because it's hard to swallow.

634
01:13:26,044 --> 01:13:27,443
Which moron said that?

635
01:13:37,989 --> 01:13:41,253
I'm done with your father's case.

636
01:13:44,293 --> 01:13:47,286
Keung didn't kill your dad for money.

637
01:13:47,498 --> 01:13:48,964
He had other reasons.

638
01:13:49,566 --> 01:13:51,193
When your dad was young,

639
01:13:51,401 --> 01:13:53,801
he ran a transportation company in Macau.

640
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:57,968
Did you learn anything from going to Macau?

641
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:08,716
Good on you.

642
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:16,055
I already told Susan.

643
01:14:17,894 --> 01:14:21,489
In Macau,
I found a homicide case from 25 years ago,

644
01:14:22,197 --> 01:14:25,258
a man Fu and his entire family were murdered,

645
01:14:25,968 --> 01:14:28,597
including his wife, mother and daughter.

646
01:14:30,073 --> 01:14:33,201
On the day of the massacre,
several killers entered the home

647
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,435
and killed without mercy.

648
01:14:34,978 --> 01:14:37,276
The entire family was dead.

649
01:14:37,581 --> 01:14:39,640
The killers also burnt the place
to destroy the evidence.

650
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:44,046
Fu was an anti-narcotics cop.

651
01:14:45,388 --> 01:14:48,983
He offended some people, and they took revenge.
Removing roots and all.

652
01:14:49,392 --> 01:14:50,792
But they missed one person.

653
01:14:50,993 --> 01:14:53,985
Fu's son, Keung.

654
01:14:56,933 --> 01:14:58,833
The police eventually caught a ten or so people.

655
01:14:59,068 --> 01:15:02,128
All of them had been investigated by Fu,

656
01:15:02,538 --> 01:15:05,565
including Man and Chow.

657
01:15:28,363 --> 01:15:29,853
Chow was in drug trafficking.

658
01:15:30,098 --> 01:15:33,660
Man was Fu's colleague.

659
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:37,505
Chow bribed Man to pull strings for him.

660
01:15:38,107 --> 01:15:41,099
Fu refused his bribe and exposed him.

661
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:47,471
Man quitted the force afterwards

662
01:15:47,682 --> 01:15:49,377
and started working for Chow.

663
01:15:51,019 --> 01:15:52,749
When Susan's mother died,

664
01:15:53,054 --> 01:15:55,989
Chow retired and moved to Hong Kong.

665
01:15:56,858 --> 01:15:58,689
The case turned cold.

666
01:16:00,062 --> 01:16:01,962
At that time, Keung survived the tragedy.

667
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:05,399
Waited for 25 years, and finally got his revenge.

668
01:16:11,573 --> 01:16:13,404
If you were him, what would you do?

669
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:20,943
If I had nothing to lose like him,

670
01:16:21,682 --> 01:16:24,880
I would have done the same.

671
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,131
What you laughing at?

672
01:17:17,137 --> 01:17:19,071
I like ...

673
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,206
I like you fighting for me.

674
01:17:20,407 --> 01:17:21,873
Come on, go upstairs.

675
01:17:24,845 --> 01:17:25,903
No, don't ...

676
01:17:26,647 --> 01:17:27,636
Bye.

677
01:17:34,922 --> 01:17:36,015
How cute.

678
01:17:41,962 --> 01:17:43,328
You've moved back to the hilltop?

679
01:17:44,265 --> 01:17:46,426
Susan's taken over her dad's fortune.

680
01:17:46,835 --> 01:17:48,735
She said that's her home after all.

681
01:17:52,005 --> 01:17:52,994
Chief,

682
01:17:54,641 --> 01:17:57,109
remember we went to Keung's house?

683
01:17:58,212 --> 01:17:59,702
That night when Tsui hit you?

684
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:04,617
I have been there by myself

685
01:18:05,985 --> 01:18:07,180
before we did.

686
01:18:12,393 --> 01:18:13,416
You thought I was a suspect?

687
01:18:16,764 --> 01:18:19,164
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

688
01:18:19,866 --> 01:18:21,562
I would have done the same if I were you.

689
01:18:51,031 --> 01:18:53,056
According to Mr. Chow's will,

690
01:18:53,233 --> 01:18:54,961
all the properties,

691
01:18:55,401 --> 01:18:58,302
stocks, bonds and cash

692
01:18:58,438 --> 01:19:00,565
will be inherited solely by Ms. Chow.

693
01:19:00,773 --> 01:19:03,139
In principle, all of Mr. Chow's fortune

694
01:19:03,309 --> 01:19:05,300
is now Ms. Chow's.

695
01:19:14,787 --> 01:19:16,778
Hello? Speaking.

696
01:19:18,157 --> 01:19:19,681
Broadband installation tomorrow night?

697
01:19:21,762 --> 01:19:24,389
Please give me a call before you come.

698
01:20:21,052 --> 01:20:21,950
What're you doing?

699
01:20:22,888 --> 01:20:24,355
I'll tell you later.

700
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:25,582
Why so mysterious?

701
01:20:26,325 --> 01:20:27,417
Don't look.

702
01:20:27,626 --> 01:20:28,150
Let me.

703
01:20:28,361 --> 01:20:29,918
I'll tell you later.

704
01:20:31,729 --> 01:20:32,856
Sure you're not coming?

705
01:20:33,063 --> 01:20:35,327
No. You go ahead.

706
01:20:35,734 --> 01:20:38,167
Get changed.

707
01:20:40,671 --> 01:20:42,639
After I'm changed, you take your medication.

708
01:22:40,689 --> 01:22:41,748
Susan is not coming?

709
01:22:42,557 --> 01:22:44,048
She is occupied.

710
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:49,322
I don't know how to break the news to Susan.

711
01:23:05,749 --> 01:23:07,409
I got this from a fellow in Macau.

712
01:23:08,551 --> 01:23:10,348
Chow got married in 1978

713
01:23:10,987 --> 01:23:13,888
but Susan was born in 1976.

714
01:23:14,957 --> 01:23:17,323
There's no father's name
on her birth certificate.

715
01:23:17,794 --> 01:23:19,490
Chow is not Susan's real father.

716
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:45,383
Lose.

717
01:23:45,554 --> 01:23:47,852
Lose.

718
01:24:22,258 --> 01:24:24,192
There was a gas explosion at your house.

719
01:24:24,593 --> 01:24:26,824
A male body was found in the scene.

720
01:24:26,996 --> 01:24:28,861
His name is Lai.

721
01:24:29,131 --> 01:24:30,996
He was one the criminals you caught.

722
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:33,028
Looks like he came for revenge.

723
01:24:33,236 --> 01:24:35,795
Mr. Lau, your wife suffered severe shock.

724
01:24:36,005 --> 01:24:37,029
She is in a coma.

725
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:39,070
We've done everything we could.

726
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:41,036
The rest is up to her.

727
01:26:43,397 --> 01:26:44,762
Mr. Lau, please wait outside.

728
01:26:44,965 --> 01:26:46,363
2cc of 1:1000 adrenaline.

729
01:26:46,532 --> 01:26:47,396
Yes.

730
01:26:47,834 --> 01:26:48,823
CPR.

731
01:27:58,503 --> 01:28:01,564
According to the weather report,
it will be sunny this week.

732
01:28:01,907 --> 01:28:06,073
That's good.
Not like last week where it was raining every day.

733
01:28:06,312 --> 01:28:08,246
Puts everyone in a bad mood.

734
01:28:08,882 --> 01:28:11,850
The temperature will be warmer, 22 degrees.

735
01:28:12,952 --> 01:28:14,977
It's been a while since you've been in the sun.

736
01:28:16,956 --> 01:28:20,323
Once you're awake,
I'll take you for a stroll in the sun.

737
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:32,361
Thanks for your help.

738
01:28:33,773 --> 01:28:35,000
No problem.

739
01:28:35,207 --> 01:28:38,575
It's better than drinking all day, right?

740
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:40,403
Shut up.

741
01:28:40,946 --> 01:28:43,312
Hang in there, Chief.

742
01:28:43,648 --> 01:28:45,810
Susan will wake up.

743
01:28:46,118 --> 01:28:49,781
Ask her to buy you new underwear.

744
01:28:50,022 --> 01:28:52,922
I've torn some while washing, sorry.

745
01:28:53,091 --> 01:28:55,116
Wait for me downstairs. Leave!

746
01:28:58,630 --> 01:28:59,926
Leaving again?

747
01:29:01,999 --> 01:29:03,125
Go.

748
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,602
Take the stairs.

749
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,304
Bye.

750
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:30,652
You've changed.

751
01:29:33,799 --> 01:29:35,129
For better or worse?

752
01:29:36,868 --> 01:29:37,800
Better.

753
01:29:43,707 --> 01:29:45,231
When I was a cop,

754
01:29:45,710 --> 01:29:48,041
I thought I could change the world.

755
01:29:48,279 --> 01:29:51,374
I tried so hard but failed.

756
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:53,614
I didn't know what I was doing.

757
01:29:55,518 --> 01:29:56,952
Now I know,

758
01:29:57,353 --> 01:29:59,584
it's the world that's changing me.

759
01:30:07,031 --> 01:30:08,055
Chief,

760
01:30:09,233 --> 01:30:12,999
there's something that I've wanted to tell you.

761
01:30:14,905 --> 01:30:18,069
Actually Rachel's baby wasn't mine.

762
01:30:20,879 --> 01:30:24,279
I've always wanted to know who
she was waiting for that night.

763
01:30:24,883 --> 01:30:26,440
Until one month ago,

764
01:30:26,950 --> 01:30:28,781
Fung helped me find that person.

765
01:30:30,454 --> 01:30:32,217
On the night that Rachel died,

766
01:30:32,356 --> 01:30:34,051
he was on his way to meet her.

767
01:30:35,092 --> 01:30:36,423
Unfortunately,

768
01:30:36,827 --> 01:30:38,987
he had an accident and went into a coma.

769
01:30:40,164 --> 01:30:43,621
I've always thought that once I found him,
I would bash the crap out of him

770
01:30:43,801 --> 01:30:44,995
or kill him.

771
01:30:45,669 --> 01:30:47,136
In the end I didn't.

772
01:30:47,738 --> 01:30:50,900
Now, I go and see him every
week to give him a body wash.

773
01:30:51,475 --> 01:30:52,839
I've become his carer.

774
01:30:58,081 --> 01:30:59,514
Chief, don't be like this.

775
01:31:01,584 --> 01:31:02,710
I'm fine.

776
01:31:05,788 --> 01:31:07,415
I still want to have new underwear.

777
01:31:31,614 --> 01:31:34,208
What would the world be when you wake up?

778
01:31:45,295 --> 01:31:46,455
Pack some clothes.

779
01:32:27,938 --> 01:32:28,905
Take the clothes to the hospital,

780
01:32:29,038 --> 01:32:30,563
then wait for me at the HK-Macau pier.

781
01:32:30,741 --> 01:32:31,571
Go.

782
01:32:35,577 --> 01:32:37,045
Tsui, this is Bong.

783
01:32:37,213 --> 01:32:38,736
Please check Sir Lau file for me.

784
01:33:28,130 --> 01:33:31,964
In the past my master baked the
quail in the belly of the geese.

785
01:33:32,167 --> 01:33:34,965
The goose was crispy, and the quails were sweet.

786
01:33:35,137 --> 01:33:36,900
But it's hard to find now.

787
01:33:38,273 --> 01:33:39,398
You're so fat.

788
01:33:39,607 --> 01:33:42,668
That's true. 20 years ago, I wasn't this fat.

789
01:33:42,844 --> 01:33:45,608
I was very slim, only 80 pounds.

790
01:33:46,148 --> 01:33:48,207
Right, I heard that you were an athlete before

791
01:33:48,383 --> 01:33:52,149
Yes. World Table Tennis champion. Undefeated.

792
01:33:52,954 --> 01:33:54,478
How about the match in 1978?

793
01:33:54,623 --> 01:33:56,454
1978...

794
01:33:56,558 --> 01:33:59,651
Yeah, I did lose that match
but I still came runner up.

795
01:34:00,494 --> 01:34:02,519
Do you remember the name
of the person who won?

796
01:34:02,731 --> 01:34:05,392
It was a long time ago. I don't remember.

797
01:34:05,634 --> 01:34:07,601
- All right.
- Thank you.

798
01:34:07,802 --> 01:34:09,735
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

799
01:34:09,903 --> 01:34:11,166
Thanks.

800
01:34:18,111 --> 01:34:18,669
Let's go.

801
01:34:24,618 --> 01:34:26,917
Captain Lau Ching Hei, line 3.

802
01:34:57,351 --> 01:34:58,409
Have you waken up?

803
01:35:01,554 --> 01:35:03,284
Did you marry me

804
01:35:04,058 --> 01:35:05,753
in order to kill Dad?

805
01:35:13,233 --> 01:35:14,131
Yes.

806
01:35:17,370 --> 01:35:19,270
So why are you still here?

807
01:35:21,841 --> 01:35:23,502
I don't want you to be hurt.

808
01:35:24,611 --> 01:35:26,511
I want to see you wake up.

809
01:35:29,083 --> 01:35:30,675
Have you ever loved me?

810
01:35:34,488 --> 01:35:35,420
I have.

811
01:35:40,461 --> 01:35:41,688
No, you haven't.

812
01:36:30,177 --> 01:36:31,837
I'm fine.

813
01:36:46,425 --> 01:36:47,619
I'm fine.

814
01:36:51,597 --> 01:36:52,928
Why did you get so drunk?

815
01:36:58,370 --> 01:36:59,702
I'm fine.

816
01:37:00,973 --> 01:37:06,276
I just solved Susan's dad's case.

817
01:37:06,912 --> 01:37:09,278
So I had a few to celebrate.

818
01:37:10,148 --> 01:37:11,912
While I was boozing,

819
01:37:12,117 --> 01:37:14,643
I thought about how Susan is at the moment,

820
01:37:15,053 --> 01:37:17,020
I really don't know how to tell her.

821
01:37:18,890 --> 01:37:20,916
So I kept thinking,

822
01:37:21,692 --> 01:37:23,284
and drinking.

823
01:37:25,129 --> 01:37:28,190
the more I thought, the more I drank.

824
01:37:28,733 --> 01:37:31,430
The more I drank, the more I thought.

825
01:37:34,439 --> 01:37:37,637
I went to Macau a few days ago.

826
01:37:37,976 --> 01:37:40,069
You know where I went?

827
01:37:41,713 --> 01:37:44,375
I went to Keung's primary school.

828
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:47,408
In 1978,

829
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:49,881
he won the inter-schools competition.

830
01:37:50,922 --> 01:37:53,448
He took his new table tennis bat.

831
01:37:55,626 --> 01:37:58,527
Carrying the new paddle,

832
01:37:58,797 --> 01:38:01,993
And went home to show his dad,

833
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,332
Instead,

834
01:38:04,536 --> 01:38:06,436
he saw his family

835
01:38:06,637 --> 01:38:09,129
get killed by Man and Chow.

836
01:38:54,618 --> 01:38:58,486
Keung was afraid and ran away.

837
01:38:58,656 --> 01:39:00,988
He witnessed the entire sequence of events.

838
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,890
He ran to his father's workplace.

839
01:39:12,703 --> 01:39:18,700
But he found that all of his father's friends
and colleagues were involved with the killers.

840
01:39:20,211 --> 01:39:22,007
So he didn't dare report it to the police.

841
01:39:23,278 --> 01:39:24,837
Because he knew

842
01:39:25,448 --> 01:39:28,906
the killers would finish the job.

843
01:39:31,721 --> 01:39:36,590
He became homeless and hid outside
a Sisters Covenant for a week.

844
01:39:38,062 --> 01:39:40,189
A Sister found him

845
01:39:40,931 --> 01:39:43,729
and took him into the Covenant's orphanage.

846
01:39:45,469 --> 01:39:47,835
The Sister asked him his name,

847
01:39:48,039 --> 01:39:49,870
Without hesitation, he said:

848
01:39:50,341 --> 01:39:52,900
My name is Lau Ching Hei.

849
01:39:58,515 --> 01:40:01,484
This name protected his life.

850
01:40:02,819 --> 01:40:05,447
When he heard Chow moved to Hong Kong,

851
01:40:05,889 --> 01:40:08,653
He followed him to Hong Kong.

852
01:40:08,958 --> 01:40:11,518
Got into school.
After college, he became a cop.

853
01:40:11,761 --> 01:40:13,592
Then he married Susan.

854
01:40:13,963 --> 01:40:16,932
In the end, he killed Chow.

855
01:40:20,571 --> 01:40:21,935
A bit far-fetched.

856
01:40:22,739 --> 01:40:23,966
Isn't it, Keung?

857
01:40:33,215 --> 01:40:33,943
You'll never understand.

858
01:40:36,952 --> 01:40:38,715
Have you ever lost everything?

859
01:40:39,188 --> 01:40:40,486
I have.

860
01:40:41,859 --> 01:40:43,849
I lost everything in one day.

861
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:46,585
My home, my family,

862
01:40:46,763 --> 01:40:48,560
even my own identity.

863
01:40:49,233 --> 01:40:50,859
I want Chow to experience that.

864
01:40:54,204 --> 01:40:59,835
I didn't think about revenge for a long time
Because there was no opportunity.

865
01:41:01,244 --> 01:41:03,336
4 years ago in the police record,

866
01:41:03,612 --> 01:41:04,841
I accidentally discovered
another person called Keung.

867
01:41:06,850 --> 01:41:10,216
He's also from Macau, with no relatives.

868
01:41:11,153 --> 01:41:13,348
The same ordinary name.

869
01:41:13,689 --> 01:41:15,623
This was an opportunity sent by above.

870
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:19,893
What about Wong?

871
01:41:22,265 --> 01:41:25,166
He said that for $50,000, he would kill for me.

872
01:41:25,768 --> 01:41:26,791
who cares if someone like that dies.

873
01:41:26,935 --> 01:41:28,265
And Susan?

874
01:41:32,373 --> 01:41:33,931
She was part of my plan.

875
01:41:35,977 --> 01:41:39,413
To get to Chow, I followed her

876
01:41:40,181 --> 01:41:43,015
to the movies, and restaurants.

877
01:41:43,653 --> 01:41:45,017
Even holidays.

878
01:41:48,857 --> 01:41:50,951
After we married, we came back to Hong Kong.

879
01:41:51,795 --> 01:41:53,159
I went to see Chow

880
01:41:53,830 --> 01:41:55,956
and told him I was Fu's son.

881
01:42:00,635 --> 01:42:02,194
Susan should not have died.

882
01:42:05,007 --> 01:42:06,531
Should my family have died?

883
01:42:18,754 --> 01:42:21,348
I always thought this was a perfect plan.

884
01:42:22,157 --> 01:42:23,454
I did everything perfectly.

885
01:42:24,927 --> 01:42:27,259
Then I saw Susan in the hospital.

886
01:42:29,565 --> 01:42:32,930
I realized that it didn't matter whether
she was Chow's daughter or not,

887
01:42:35,369 --> 01:42:36,801
She's my wife.

888
01:42:38,372 --> 01:42:39,771
My family.

889
01:42:44,378 --> 01:42:48,372
She was the same as my father,
mother, sister, and grandmother.

890
01:42:53,387 --> 01:42:54,855
They're all my relatives.

891
01:46:24,096 --> 01:46:25,926
Thank you.

892
01:46:31,669 --> 01:46:33,364
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

893
01:46:43,047 --> 01:46:45,412
When I said that I loved you,
I was serious.

894
01:46:48,285 --> 01:46:49,514
I know.

895
01:46:53,591 --> 01:46:57,084
You once said that I should not
give you any money in the future.

896
01:46:57,495 --> 01:46:58,827
You've got to keep your promise.

897
01:46:59,031 --> 01:47:00,089
Of course.

898
01:47:03,635 --> 01:47:06,103
No .. I meant ...

899
01:47:06,305 --> 01:47:08,170
No way ...

900
01:47:08,474 --> 01:47:09,964
That day I ...

901
01:47:18,449 --> 01:47:21,077
But you know... for things around the home

902
01:47:21,252 --> 01:47:23,618
could you give me just a little bit?

903
01:47:23,788 --> 01:47:25,186
How much?

904
01:47:25,456 --> 01:47:28,186
The more you pay, the better the service.

905
01:47:28,392 --> 01:47:29,518
Boss.
