1
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:12,631
How did those soldiers ever manage
to dig out these tunnels?

2
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,909
Let's get a rotation in here.

3
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:16,979
Hey, I found something!

4
00:02:31,995 --> 00:02:33,087
Hanako...

5
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:35,998
We soldiers dig.

6
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,162
We dig all day.

7
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:43,230
This is the hole that we will fight...

8
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,770
and die in.

9
00:02:48,112 --> 00:02:49,579
Hanako...

10
00:02:50,114 --> 00:02:53,379
am I digging my own grave?

11
00:03:27,176 --> 00:03:30,703
Today, I head for the post
where my men await.

12
00:03:31,614 --> 00:03:35,812
I am determined to serve
and give my life for my country.

13
00:03:36,953 --> 00:03:39,478
I believe I have organized
everything at home...

14
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:44,285
but I am sorry I wasn't able to attend
to the kitchen floor before I left.

15
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:46,724
I had all the intention...

16
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:49,228
but had to leave
without having the time...

17
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:51,724
and I am still worried about it.

18
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:55,129
So make sure to have
Taro take care of it promptly.

19
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,169
Damn this island!
The Americans can have it.

20
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,981
Nothing grows here.

21
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,982
It smells. It's hot. There are too many
damn bugs, and there's no water.

22
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,060
This island is part
of Japan's sacred homeland.

23
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:23,423
There's nothing sacred about this island.

24
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:28,163
Saigo.

25
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:32,405
We should just give the island
to the Americans...

26
00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:34,108
and then we can go home.

27
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,772
Saigo!

28
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:41,947
What did you say, soldier?

29
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:47,077
I said if we beat the Americans,
then we can go home.

30
00:04:48,257 --> 00:04:50,384
You there, is that what he said?

31
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:54,125
Yes, sir.

32
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:18,037
I'm Kuribayashi.

33
00:06:18,281 --> 00:06:20,943
Welcome, General.
I am Admiral Ohsugi.

34
00:06:21,317 --> 00:06:23,649
How long have you been
waiting here for me?

35
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:26,152
Three hours, sir.

36
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:27,653
Sorry to hear that.

37
00:06:27,857 --> 00:06:32,385
They wouldn't allow me to wire my arrival
after what happened to Admiral Yamamoto.

38
00:06:32,662 --> 00:06:33,788
I understand, sir.

39
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,895
This is my aide, Lieutenant Fujita.

40
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:39,023
What's the matter, Admiral?
You don't look very well.

41
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:42,568
It's nothing, sir. The water
doesn't agree with me here.

42
00:06:42,738 --> 00:06:44,228
Sorry to hear that.

43
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:46,397
This way to your quarters.

44
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:49,303
Admiral, I want to make a round
of the island first.

45
00:06:49,512 --> 00:06:51,537
Shall I fetch a vehicle?

46
00:06:51,714 --> 00:06:53,682
No, let's walk.

47
00:06:54,684 --> 00:06:56,311
Walking is good for the health.

48
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:58,646
It might be just what you need, Ohsugi.

49
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,333
So that's Suribachi.

50
00:07:25,381 --> 00:07:26,439
You unpatriotic...

51
00:07:27,183 --> 00:07:28,514
no-good peasants!

52
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:30,213
Hey, stop it!

53
00:07:33,956 --> 00:07:35,048
Stand up!

54
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:37,423
What are you doing?

55
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:41,460
These soldiers...

56
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,324
were conspiring
with unpatriotic words, sir.

57
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,496
I see.

58
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:51,366
And, Captain, do you have
such an excess of soldiers...

59
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,168
that you could put two
of them out of commission?

60
00:07:55,077 --> 00:07:56,271
No, sir.

61
00:07:57,213 --> 00:07:58,840
Then stop beating them.

62
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:01,513
Deny their lunch rations instead.

63
00:08:02,051 --> 00:08:05,748
A good captain uses his brain,
not just his whip.

64
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:12,455
What is all this?

65
00:08:13,095 --> 00:08:14,289
All this?

66
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:15,894
Trenches, sir.

67
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:18,362
Why are the men digging trenches here?

68
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:21,734
This is where the Americans
are expected to land.

69
00:08:23,572 --> 00:08:25,301
Have them stop immediately.

70
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:27,541
But, General...

71
00:08:28,144 --> 00:08:29,372
And, Captain...

72
00:08:30,212 --> 00:08:32,203
make sure these men get proper breaks.

73
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:34,982
They look like they're from Mars.

74
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,958
Stop digging!

75
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:07,780
Just as well.

76
00:09:08,984 --> 00:09:11,817
My stomach has been
bothering me anyway.

77
00:09:13,022 --> 00:09:15,252
A toast to General Kuribayashi...

78
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,620
a fine commander.

79
00:09:22,631 --> 00:09:24,292
Better than sake!

80
00:09:25,134 --> 00:09:26,863
I heard he lived in America.

81
00:09:28,104 --> 00:09:30,538
Maybe that's why he
doesn't want us digging trenches.

82
00:09:30,706 --> 00:09:32,435
Maybe he likes Americans.

83
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:36,270
No, stupid.
He studied the Americans.

84
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,147
So now he knows how to beat them.

85
00:09:42,852 --> 00:09:44,649
I heard from someone in the 204th...

86
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:49,950
that another general was
supposed to command the island...

87
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:53,787
but he didn't want the job.

88
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:59,292
So Premier Tojo gave it
to Kuribayashi instead.

89
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:04,571
Nozaki, you hear a lot of things...

90
00:10:06,008 --> 00:10:08,169
but your ears are full of wax!

91
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:13,872
Anyway, you can't trust anyone
from the 204th.

92
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:15,914
They're part of the Navy.

93
00:10:16,252 --> 00:10:19,244
I think this Kuribayashi
must be a superb general.

94
00:10:19,822 --> 00:10:21,016
Look...

95
00:10:21,757 --> 00:10:27,059
we're not digging those damn trenches
in the sand anymore, are we?

96
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:46,571
This heat is more than I had anticipated.

97
00:10:51,353 --> 00:10:56,381
This island is bigger than I thought.
I'm exhausted.

98
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:05,193
Ito, reporting for duty.

99
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:07,392
Thank you for coming right away.

100
00:11:08,637 --> 00:11:11,265
How much air force
do we have available?

101
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,068
41 Zekes and 13 bombers, sir.

102
00:11:14,243 --> 00:11:15,232
Is that all?

103
00:11:15,411 --> 00:11:19,472
In order to support Saipan,
we lost 66 planes a few days ago.

104
00:11:20,783 --> 00:11:25,117
We will have to rely on support
from the Combined Fleet then.

105
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,082
Is this the current defense plan?

106
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:37,732
And what about the Army troops?
Where will they be stationed?

107
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:42,434
I don't know exactly.

108
00:11:42,605 --> 00:11:45,472
They are under independent
command of Colonel Adachi.

109
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:48,007
You have not coordinated
your plans with the Army?

110
00:11:48,177 --> 00:11:50,941
According to Navy rules,
until the enemy lands...

111
00:11:51,113 --> 00:11:54,014
This is a real war!
You are aware of that, aren't you?

112
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:01,315
This will not work.

113
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,958
You are concentrating all
your efforts on the beaches.

114
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,557
- Move the artillery to higher ground.
- But, sir, we just had them...

115
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,322
moved down to the beaches.

116
00:12:09,498 --> 00:12:10,965
Well, move them back.

117
00:12:13,335 --> 00:12:15,929
Coordinate with the Army
and have them start immediately.

118
00:12:16,105 --> 00:12:19,165
Fortifications at Suribachi are the priority.

119
00:12:19,642 --> 00:12:20,939
I'm going to walk some more.

120
00:12:21,143 --> 00:12:24,010
- It's pitch black out there, sir.
- I know.

121
00:12:35,024 --> 00:12:36,514
This one is trouble.

122
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:41,827
Army commanders usually are, sir.

123
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,905
Another letter?

124
00:13:26,108 --> 00:13:29,202
You know that the mail only goes out
when there's a boat available?

125
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:31,077
I have a lot of family.

126
00:13:31,614 --> 00:13:34,412
Then how come all your letters
are addressed to your wife?

127
00:13:36,018 --> 00:13:37,178
Nosey!

128
00:13:37,386 --> 00:13:39,013
Here, let me do you a favor.

129
00:13:39,555 --> 00:13:42,718
Otherwise, your letters
will never make it through.

130
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:45,587
Hey, what are you doing?

131
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:49,464
I used to work at the censorship office
in Tokyo before I was transferred.

132
00:13:50,432 --> 00:13:52,229
You mean demoted.

133
00:13:53,202 --> 00:13:56,729
"To Hanako: We soldiers dig.
We dig all day."

134
00:13:56,939 --> 00:13:59,601
No, no, no. This will never pass.

135
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,202
Give me that back!

136
00:14:11,987 --> 00:14:16,390
There. You'll thank me
for this later, Saigo.

137
00:14:20,229 --> 00:14:21,389
Next!

138
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:29,131
Good!

139
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:57,290
Are you blind?

140
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:00,631
Can't you see the target?

141
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,303
Even my six-year-old could
shoot better than you do.

142
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:07,668
Do it again!

143
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:17,208
You're an embarrassment!
You call yourself an lmperial soldier?

144
00:15:19,154 --> 00:15:22,715
Tonight you will clean the boots
of your entire troop.

145
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:23,983
Go to the rear!

146
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:30,124
They should learn to clean their guns
properly, rather than their boots.

147
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:07,532
What are those tanks doing here?

148
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,863
Those are out of commission, sir.
They are waiting for parts.

149
00:16:12,074 --> 00:16:14,702
- For how long?
- About a month, sir.

150
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:37,930
Taro, America is filled with cars.

151
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:43,231
I have to be very careful
when I cross the street...

152
00:16:44,072 --> 00:16:46,632
there are so many cars everywhere.

153
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:51,702
Taro, are you behaving yourself
and listening to your mother?

154
00:16:52,447 --> 00:16:54,074
I miss you.

155
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:07,391
These civilians need to be
evacuated as soon as possible.

156
00:17:08,597 --> 00:17:10,326
Yes, sir.

157
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,684
Hanako...

158
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:15,529
we have a celebrity here.

159
00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:19,464
Baron Nishi, the Olympic gold medalist
in horse jumping.

160
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:23,667
He will lead the 26th tank regiment...

161
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:27,206
and has just arrived from Tokyo.

162
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,354
Nishi is very handsome, and there are
rumors of his womanizing skills.

163
00:18:47,596 --> 00:18:51,862
But there are no women
left on the island to woo.

164
00:19:18,226 --> 00:19:21,252
Lieutenant Colonel Nishi!
You brought your horse.

165
00:19:21,863 --> 00:19:23,023
From Chichi Jima.

166
00:19:29,104 --> 00:19:31,197
I used to be a cavalryman myself,
you know.

167
00:19:31,373 --> 00:19:33,432
Of course, I know.

168
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:37,110
I've been looking forward
to serving under you.

169
00:19:37,713 --> 00:19:40,204
One who understands horses
the way I do.

170
00:19:40,382 --> 00:19:44,546
When we used to ride horses
through the battlefield...

171
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,585
those were the good old days...

172
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,049
not like these mechanized contraptions.

173
00:19:51,393 --> 00:19:53,588
I could send for another horse...

174
00:19:54,463 --> 00:19:55,953
and we could ride together.

175
00:19:56,131 --> 00:19:57,792
I'm afraid my riding days are over.

176
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:04,168
But tell me about this famous horse
of yours that you won the Olympics with.

177
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:06,404
My stallion, Uranus.

178
00:20:17,786 --> 00:20:20,914
Oh, yes, this horse has a fine back.

179
00:20:24,493 --> 00:20:26,461
I bought him in Italy.

180
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:29,286
They were happy to get rid of him.

181
00:20:29,464 --> 00:20:32,194
He was such a wild horse.

182
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:37,501
No one could tame the beast,
but I told them...

183
00:20:37,672 --> 00:20:39,606
such a headstrong horse...

184
00:20:40,008 --> 00:20:43,375
is a perfect match for me.

185
00:20:47,783 --> 00:20:50,445
Come dine with me tonight.
I feel like having a drink.

186
00:20:51,353 --> 00:20:52,843
I think that can be arranged.

187
00:21:02,564 --> 00:21:04,998
How did you manage to get
the Johnnie Walker?

188
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:07,396
I drank some already.

189
00:21:13,742 --> 00:21:16,540
I'm sorry. This is all we have.

190
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:18,838
That's fine, as long as we have this.

191
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:24,982
What is this empty plate?

192
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:30,648
I have told our cook that all officers will
have the same rations and food as our men.

193
00:21:30,826 --> 00:21:33,886
I'm sorry, but serving three dishes
is regulation.

194
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:38,661
Oh, but of course we have the right to be
served more than three dishes per meal.

195
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:40,062
You're absolutely right.

196
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:53,044
When you think about it...

197
00:21:53,415 --> 00:21:57,715
it is regrettable that most of the
Combined Fleet was destroyed.

198
00:21:59,287 --> 00:22:01,050
We still have some battleships left...

199
00:22:01,223 --> 00:22:06,217
but we have very little striking power
from the air or sea.

200
00:22:07,362 --> 00:22:08,852
Nishi, what do you mean?

201
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,796
So you have not heard about
the Mariana battle?

202
00:22:17,906 --> 00:22:22,900
Admiral Ozawa's carrier and boat planes
were destroyed.

203
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,879
The lmperial headquarters...

204
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:30,416
is deceiving not just the people,
but us as well.

205
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:33,583
If you want my honest opinion, General...

206
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,224
the best thing to do...

207
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:42,587
would be to sink the island
to the bottom of the sea.

208
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:46,931
And yet, you still came?

209
00:22:50,105 --> 00:22:51,163
Well...

210
00:22:51,606 --> 00:22:56,600
I figured your men were going to need
all the tanks that I could bring.

211
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,027
This must be it.

212
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:49,397
Yes, the enemy must land here.

213
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:55,927
Run!

214
00:23:57,005 --> 00:23:58,597
Like you were one of the Americans!

215
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,740
Go on! Which direction would you take?

216
00:24:29,638 --> 00:24:30,866
Hey...

217
00:24:31,973 --> 00:24:34,066
I think your general has gone mad.

218
00:24:38,046 --> 00:24:39,775
Look at the gun he has.

219
00:24:44,386 --> 00:24:47,378
He probably took it
from a dead American.

220
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:49,923
Maybe.

221
00:24:57,999 --> 00:24:59,330
Break time is over.

222
00:25:00,068 --> 00:25:01,296
Back to work!

223
00:25:05,974 --> 00:25:07,669
Are you all right, Kashiwara?

224
00:25:08,276 --> 00:25:09,903
You look pale.

225
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,773
I'm fine. It's just the damn water.

226
00:25:14,482 --> 00:25:18,282
But... l... really... need to go.

227
00:25:37,706 --> 00:25:39,936
There will be a major change
in our strategy.

228
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:45,341
We will dig caves in the Motoyama,
Higashiyama, and Suribachi-yama areas.

229
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,283
We will build these underground
fortifications, and fight to the end.

230
00:25:50,585 --> 00:25:53,782
- What about the beach defenses, sir?
- Not needed.

231
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:58,954
But, sir, the beach trenches
are our first line of defense.

232
00:25:59,127 --> 00:26:02,494
Without the beach trenches,
how do you expect us to win?

233
00:26:02,664 --> 00:26:07,658
Hayashi, do you know how many cars
America produces in a year?

234
00:26:07,836 --> 00:26:08,996
Five million.

235
00:26:09,471 --> 00:26:12,531
The Americans' technological advancements
cannot be underestimated.

236
00:26:12,707 --> 00:26:15,505
They will cross the beaches eventually.

237
00:26:17,078 --> 00:26:19,603
If we waste our soldiers there,
there is no hope for victory.

238
00:26:19,781 --> 00:26:21,544
It is inevitable that men will die...

239
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,381
but I never heard of an island operation
without beach fortifications.

240
00:26:25,553 --> 00:26:29,182
General, it will be a futile waste of time
to start digging tunnels now.

241
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:30,984
We should force the enemy
near the island...

242
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:33,320
and launch a pincer drive
from the sea and air.

243
00:26:33,495 --> 00:26:35,861
I agree. That makes the most sense.

244
00:26:36,064 --> 00:26:37,156
Ohsugi...

245
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:39,894
doesn't the Navy know?

246
00:26:43,938 --> 00:26:47,430
The Combined Fleet has been completely
destroyed off the Marianas.

247
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:49,734
The island is now isolated.

248
00:26:55,316 --> 00:26:59,013
What's more, I received a new order from
the lmperial headquarters this morning.

249
00:26:59,387 --> 00:27:03,585
The remaining fighter planes are to be
sent back to Tokyo to defend the mainland.

250
00:27:03,758 --> 00:27:06,784
Outrageous! How are we to fight?

251
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:14,467
We do not have time for discussion.
We should head back.

252
00:27:47,469 --> 00:27:48,629
Dear Mother...

253
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:53,502
I have been commissioned
to a new troop today.

254
00:27:55,276 --> 00:27:58,768
I cannot talk about this transfer now.

255
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:02,078
Take good care of yourself.

256
00:28:16,264 --> 00:28:17,595
Look at this picture.

257
00:28:20,835 --> 00:28:22,530
That's some fancy castle.

258
00:28:23,838 --> 00:28:26,500
You know who this castle was built for?

259
00:28:27,342 --> 00:28:29,139
Someone who was already dead.

260
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:33,704
They must have had
a lot of money back then...

261
00:28:34,249 --> 00:28:36,342
to build a castle like that
for a dead person.

262
00:28:37,986 --> 00:28:40,181
Why are you reading that book anyway?

263
00:28:40,788 --> 00:28:43,484
We're never going to war over there.

264
00:28:44,692 --> 00:28:47,752
We'll be lucky if we even get
a hole in the ground when we're dead.

265
00:28:48,496 --> 00:28:50,487
Don't talk about that. It's bad luck.

266
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,967
Is this the 312th?

267
00:28:58,306 --> 00:28:59,705
That's right.

268
00:29:00,575 --> 00:29:03,169
I'm Nozaki. This is Saigo.

269
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:08,509
Shimizu, you can put your bedroll there.

270
00:29:12,987 --> 00:29:14,852
There's an empty space in the back.

271
00:29:16,491 --> 00:29:17,719
Don't mind him.

272
00:29:18,993 --> 00:29:22,429
His friend Kashiwara just died.

273
00:29:23,331 --> 00:29:25,094
That used to be his spot.

274
00:29:32,774 --> 00:29:34,708
But we are all going to die.

275
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,501
That's the plan, isn't it?

276
00:29:39,747 --> 00:29:41,738
For our country, it is an honor.

277
00:29:44,052 --> 00:29:46,350
Kashiwara died of honorable dysentery.

278
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:50,451
Shimizu, where are you from?

279
00:29:52,794 --> 00:29:54,056
Kanagawa-ken.

280
00:29:55,763 --> 00:29:57,788
Ozawa is from there, aren't you?

281
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:00,197
That's right.

282
00:30:04,138 --> 00:30:05,765
Where were you trained?

283
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:09,476
Maybe we were at the same school?

284
00:30:10,545 --> 00:30:11,603
No.

285
00:30:12,313 --> 00:30:14,474
I trained in Tokyo.

286
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:17,248
I trained in Tokyo, too. Where?

287
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:26,820
The Koho Kimmu Yoin Yoseijo.

288
00:30:38,606 --> 00:30:39,903
Hey...

289
00:30:41,376 --> 00:30:43,640
why do you think they put
a Kempeitai in our unit?

290
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:45,176
I don't know.

291
00:30:49,517 --> 00:30:52,680
He's not wearing the white armband.
He's not Kempeitai.

292
00:30:54,489 --> 00:30:56,650
He went to the Kempeitai
military academy.

293
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,693
Maybe he was kicked out.

294
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:05,592
He acts like a Kempeitai.

295
00:31:10,171 --> 00:31:12,639
Look at his holster.
That's not standard issue.

296
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:18,142
He's been put here to spy on us.

297
00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:22,372
Why would he spy on us?

298
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:27,847
Maybe it's those letters
you've been writing.

299
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:31,783
You should be careful.

300
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:00,512
Weed soup again?

301
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:06,082
Kuribayashi is conserving
our food supplies for the battle.

302
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:10,725
We'll be dead
before the Americans even get here.

303
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:15,695
And you would think that with all my
war effort contributions...

304
00:32:15,937 --> 00:32:19,532
we should be eating kasutera cakes
or sandwiches.

305
00:32:20,942 --> 00:32:22,102
What?

306
00:32:22,877 --> 00:32:28,110
I ran a bakery in Ohmiya with my wife.

307
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:30,380
Back when we could still get sugar...

308
00:32:31,853 --> 00:32:36,449
we sold ampan and kasutera cakes.

309
00:32:44,365 --> 00:32:48,267
However, his Kempeitai brethren...

310
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:51,703
used to come and take
whatever they wanted.

311
00:32:55,076 --> 00:32:56,771
For the war...

312
00:32:58,613 --> 00:33:00,410
For the country...

313
00:33:02,884 --> 00:33:04,442
Why bread?

314
00:33:07,622 --> 00:33:12,924
We ran into those types
at our clothing store as well.

315
00:33:15,263 --> 00:33:17,561
When we started making sandwiches...

316
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:21,261
they took those, too.

317
00:33:23,337 --> 00:33:26,932
And when we ran out of meat
and just had bread, they still came.

318
00:33:32,113 --> 00:33:36,447
Eventually, they took all of our
baking equipment for the metal...

319
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,248
and we were out of business.

320
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,957
I should have been a fisherman.

321
00:33:51,332 --> 00:33:53,527
It must have been hard on your wife...

322
00:33:56,437 --> 00:33:58,962
without the shop
and without her husband.

323
00:34:32,673 --> 00:34:36,632
Tell them to go away.
We have nothing to sell.

324
00:34:42,683 --> 00:34:46,414
Congratulations! Your husband
is going to war.

325
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:02,931
Thank you very much.

326
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:07,438
I'm happy to serve the country.

327
00:35:11,545 --> 00:35:15,037
Prayers for your eternal success at arms.

328
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:20,076
I beg of you! We have only each other.

329
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:26,282
This is not the time.

330
00:35:28,362 --> 00:35:33,026
We have all sent our husbands
and sons to war.

331
00:35:33,868 --> 00:35:38,066
We all have to do our part.

332
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:44,707
At least you'll have a little one
to carry on your name.

333
00:35:58,025 --> 00:36:00,550
I can't eat with you like that.

334
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:07,864
What am I going to do after you die?

335
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:16,471
I'm not in the coffin yet.

336
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,046
The men never come home,
not even a soul.

337
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,720
They'll never let you come home.

338
00:36:29,757 --> 00:36:31,156
Don't worry.

339
00:36:33,661 --> 00:36:35,288
And now, with the baby.

340
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:00,283
Can you hear me?

341
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:03,320
It's Dad.

342
00:37:06,293 --> 00:37:07,351
Listen.

343
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:14,028
Don't tell anyone
what I'm telling you now.

344
00:37:16,337 --> 00:37:17,497
It's a secret.

345
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,948
Your dad...

346
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:39,817
is going to come home for you.

347
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:37,277
Hurry up!

348
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:42,245
The enemy approaches!

349
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:54,366
This is ridiculous!

350
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:57,233
Why waste time digging these tunnels?

351
00:38:57,905 --> 00:38:59,964
They are all going to die anyway.

352
00:39:00,574 --> 00:39:04,135
At least he conceded
to the pillboxes on the beach.

353
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:18,786
You wanted to see me, sir?

354
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,484
Care for a drink?

355
00:39:26,967 --> 00:39:29,265
You have been looking
quite pale these days.

356
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:36,607
It's the water. It has
never agreed with me.

357
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:38,239
That's not good.

358
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,806
Why don't you go back
to the mainland to recoup?

359
00:39:44,418 --> 00:39:48,582
I have commissioned Admiral Ichimaru
to take your place.

360
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:52,589
We are wasting time
digging these tunnels.

361
00:39:53,294 --> 00:39:57,424
General, the island won't last
five days without fleet support.

362
00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:01,365
We should fight to the death.

363
00:40:02,803 --> 00:40:07,137
The tunnel-digging may be futile.

364
00:40:07,942 --> 00:40:11,844
Maybe the stand on lwo will be futile.

365
00:40:12,313 --> 00:40:14,508
Maybe the whole war is futile.

366
00:40:14,682 --> 00:40:16,343
But will you give up then?

367
00:40:16,684 --> 00:40:18,811
We will defend this island
until we are dead!

368
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:21,216
Until the very last soldier is dead!

369
00:40:22,056 --> 00:40:26,390
If our children can live safely
for one more day...

370
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:29,788
it would be worth the one more day
that we defend this island!

371
00:40:30,698 --> 00:40:31,892
Ohsugi...

372
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:36,492
if you have an ounce
of pride left as an officer...

373
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:38,702
I beg of you...

374
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,468
go back to headquarters
and ask them to send support.

375
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:10,898
So the rumor is true?
I couldn't believe it.

376
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:16,173
I'm grateful to be leaving this island.

377
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:19,902
We may have had our differences...

378
00:41:21,081 --> 00:41:23,948
but I'm truly sorry to see you go.

379
00:41:25,452 --> 00:41:28,615
General Hayashi, it is up to you now.

380
00:41:30,224 --> 00:41:35,093
Kuribayashi belongs behind a desk,
not commanding war.

381
00:41:35,863 --> 00:41:37,228
I understand.

382
00:41:37,564 --> 00:41:41,091
There are many of us
who agree with you, sir.

383
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:57,205
Listen.

384
00:41:57,718 --> 00:42:01,415
The Americans are likely to land here.

385
00:42:02,923 --> 00:42:05,323
Crossfire positions will be here...

386
00:42:06,493 --> 00:42:07,482
here...

387
00:42:08,629 --> 00:42:09,789
and here.

388
00:42:11,231 --> 00:42:12,493
The fact is...

389
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:18,969
we are completely
outnumbered in every sector.

390
00:42:20,774 --> 00:42:22,765
But we have a great advantage.

391
00:42:23,777 --> 00:42:26,337
Can anyone tell me what that is?

392
00:42:31,952 --> 00:42:34,944
The Americans are weak-willed
and inferior to Japanese soldiers.

393
00:42:35,122 --> 00:42:36,589
Very good, Shimizu.

394
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:38,981
Why is that?

395
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:40,851
They are not as disciplined...

396
00:42:41,028 --> 00:42:43,758
and they let their emotions
interfere with their duty.

397
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:45,193
That is correct.

398
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:51,861
Here is the uniform
of an American medic.

399
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,602
He should be your target.

400
00:42:55,442 --> 00:42:59,503
For Americans will risk the lives
of many soldiers to save this one.

401
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:01,505
Understood?

402
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,995
General, may I speak with you?

403
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,833
Please keep an eye on
Major General Hayashi.

404
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,300
Thank you for your concern, Nishi...

405
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:28,665
but we don't have any time to waste.

406
00:43:29,009 --> 00:43:32,240
We must think about what
we can do at this moment.

407
00:43:35,549 --> 00:43:37,016
Admiral Ichimaru.

408
00:43:40,187 --> 00:43:42,052
Reporting for duty, sir.

409
00:43:43,056 --> 00:43:44,683
Excuse me.

410
00:43:45,092 --> 00:43:47,686
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

411
00:45:46,146 --> 00:45:47,306
Jupiter!

412
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,447
Jupiter.

413
00:46:42,703 --> 00:46:43,897
Yamazaki...

414
00:46:44,938 --> 00:46:48,066
what are you doing just
sitting there? Help us...

415
00:47:28,048 --> 00:47:30,881
I think he's writing about us in his reports.

416
00:47:32,085 --> 00:47:33,746
He's just writing a letter.

417
00:47:34,254 --> 00:47:37,121
It's been two months, Nozaki.

418
00:47:38,592 --> 00:47:40,389
He would have reported us by now.

419
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,289
How can you be sure?

420
00:47:50,303 --> 00:47:53,101
Will they ever stop?

421
00:47:53,573 --> 00:47:56,599
Day and night, day and night...

422
00:47:58,979 --> 00:48:00,947
It's driving me crazy!

423
00:48:01,782 --> 00:48:06,151
If the damn Americans
are going to invade...

424
00:48:08,021 --> 00:48:09,989
why don't they hurry up and land?

425
00:48:24,671 --> 00:48:25,968
Tako-Chan...

426
00:48:26,306 --> 00:48:30,299
the four chicks that were born
two months ago have grown so much.

427
00:48:30,777 --> 00:48:34,804
The mother chicken leads them
for food every day...

428
00:48:35,315 --> 00:48:39,479
but they're giving me a hard time, picking
at the vegetable garden I have grown.

429
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:47,791
The fleet of American ships
has left Saipan.

430
00:48:56,203 --> 00:48:57,864
So they are on their way.

431
00:48:59,506 --> 00:49:01,303
Ready the troops.

432
00:49:37,043 --> 00:49:38,203
Men...

433
00:49:39,546 --> 00:49:42,538
the time has come
to show your true colors.

434
00:49:43,517 --> 00:49:45,849
As a member of the honorable
lmperial Army...

435
00:49:46,586 --> 00:49:49,054
I trust that you will fight with honor.

436
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:56,251
This island is of utmost importance
to Japan.

437
00:49:57,564 --> 00:49:58,929
Should the island fall...

438
00:50:01,234 --> 00:50:02,895
the enemy...

439
00:50:03,804 --> 00:50:07,900
will use it as their base
to attack our homeland.

440
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:10,901
For the mainland...

441
00:50:12,379 --> 00:50:13,937
For our homeland...

442
00:50:14,481 --> 00:50:16,915
Until the very last man.

443
00:50:17,784 --> 00:50:20,947
Our duty is to stop the enemy right here.

444
00:50:22,355 --> 00:50:23,822
Not one of you...

445
00:50:24,457 --> 00:50:27,654
is allowed to die until you have killed
10 enemy soldiers.

446
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:35,065
Do not expect to return home alive.

447
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:41,672
I will always be in front of you.

448
00:50:50,817 --> 00:50:52,478
Long live the Emperor.

449
00:51:36,563 --> 00:51:39,896
Take care and be well.

450
00:51:41,401 --> 00:51:46,532
I will fight courageously until the end,
in the spirit of Yamato.

451
00:51:47,707 --> 00:51:52,076
My heart will always be with you.

452
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:54,375
Takeichi.

453
00:52:10,764 --> 00:52:16,168
Every household is assigned a quota
of bag-making for the gunpowder.

454
00:52:16,937 --> 00:52:21,431
I cannot help but get tense when I think
that these will be used in battle.

455
00:52:22,275 --> 00:52:25,267
Taro and Yoko laugh at me for this.

456
00:52:26,179 --> 00:52:29,512
Takako, on evacuation in Nagano,
is also doing well.

457
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:32,444
I pray for your safety.

458
00:52:33,453 --> 00:52:35,853
Sincerely, Yoshi.

459
00:52:49,769 --> 00:52:51,464
No one can shoot me now.

460
00:52:55,475 --> 00:52:59,707
That's a nice belt.
My wife sent me one, too.

461
00:53:04,451 --> 00:53:08,615
Doesn't look like Mr. Kempeitai
has a thousand-stitch belt, does he?

462
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:11,480
Maybe he thinks it will clash
with his uniform.

463
00:53:11,658 --> 00:53:14,218
He probably doesn't believe
in superstitions, anyway.

464
00:53:19,165 --> 00:53:21,463
His mother made him one after all.

465
00:53:44,557 --> 00:53:47,720
- Maybe they're trying to sink the island.
- My head hurts.

466
00:53:47,994 --> 00:53:50,986
How many ships do you think
there are out there?

467
00:53:51,164 --> 00:53:54,861
At least 30. Maybe even 50.

468
00:53:55,201 --> 00:53:57,795
- They must be really close.
- I need to take a leak.

469
00:53:57,971 --> 00:54:00,701
Don't go near the sewers.
Dysentery is spreading through there.

470
00:54:00,874 --> 00:54:02,034
Where do I go then?

471
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:04,366
There is a pot at the end of the cave.

472
00:54:24,731 --> 00:54:26,596
The shit pot is full.

473
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,868
Someone needs to throw it out.

474
00:54:52,425 --> 00:54:54,825
If anything happens to that pot...

475
00:54:56,262 --> 00:55:01,165
you'll be carrying our shit away
with your hands.

476
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:10,032
Is this some kind of a joke?

477
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:13,538
Why are you always picking on me?

478
00:56:52,512 --> 00:56:56,972
Thank you, God. I take back
what I said before.

479
00:57:11,698 --> 00:57:13,529
Shall we commence fire?

480
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:14,992
Not yet.

481
00:57:20,106 --> 00:57:22,700
The men wish to commence firing.

482
00:57:30,216 --> 00:57:31,547
Hold your fire!

483
00:57:34,887 --> 00:57:36,218
Hold your fire!

484
00:57:36,556 --> 00:57:37,887
Hold your fire!

485
00:57:45,932 --> 00:57:48,958
They will take the beach
in no time if we do not resist.

486
00:57:49,135 --> 00:57:51,126
Wait until the beach is full.

487
00:58:13,826 --> 00:58:16,727
Let's go. Commence firing!

488
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:24,102
Commence firing!

489
00:58:25,238 --> 00:58:26,671
Commence firing!

490
00:59:28,801 --> 00:59:30,826
The guns of the Kitakubo unit
were destroyed.

491
00:59:31,003 --> 00:59:33,335
All the pillbox units on the beach
have been destroyed.

492
00:59:33,506 --> 00:59:35,406
However, all other forces are intact...

493
00:59:35,575 --> 00:59:37,839
and we estimate more than
1,000 enemy casualties.

494
00:59:38,344 --> 00:59:40,744
The pillbox destruction was unavoidable.

495
00:59:41,147 --> 00:59:43,240
Overall, that is good news.

496
00:59:43,516 --> 00:59:45,416
How are the men
holding up at Suribachi?

497
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:47,884
Forces are intact.

498
00:59:51,657 --> 00:59:53,056
What is the enemy situation?

499
00:59:53,226 --> 00:59:56,218
Approximately 20,000 men and 80 tanks.

500
00:59:56,629 --> 01:00:00,861
There has to be more than that.
They still have men waiting in the boats.

501
01:00:01,067 --> 01:00:03,558
Currently the enemy front extends...

502
01:00:04,036 --> 01:00:06,732
between Suribachi
and the south landing...

503
01:00:07,273 --> 01:00:09,537
and Chidori airfield south.

504
01:00:10,209 --> 01:00:14,407
Just as I thought... Suribachi
and the Motoyama airfield.

505
01:00:15,381 --> 01:00:17,679
They are making a two-pronged attack.

506
01:00:33,032 --> 01:00:36,195
That's not enough! I need more ammo.

507
01:01:01,427 --> 01:01:02,758
Take his place!

508
01:01:03,162 --> 01:01:05,289
- The machine gun is blasted.
- Use your rifle!

509
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,424
Watch out! lmbecile!

510
01:01:10,503 --> 01:01:11,731
I can't rely on you.

511
01:01:11,904 --> 01:01:15,101
Go send a report to Colonel Adachi
that we need another machine gun.

512
01:01:15,508 --> 01:01:16,770
Hurry up!

513
01:01:43,202 --> 01:01:45,466
Colonel Adachi is asking
for reinforcements.

514
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:50,138
We can't afford to send reinforcements.
Tell him to hold out.

515
01:02:01,521 --> 01:02:02,818
Shoot him!

516
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:13,162
- What's the matter?
- We're out of bullets!

517
01:02:31,851 --> 01:02:33,842
We are losing Suribachi.

518
01:02:34,687 --> 01:02:39,021
All is lost. Request permission
to lead a suicide mission.

519
01:02:39,525 --> 01:02:42,517
No. You must try to hold them off.

520
01:02:43,262 --> 01:02:47,096
Do what you can to survive
and join forces in the north caves.

521
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:48,992
But, sir...

522
01:02:49,702 --> 01:02:52,603
I have failed to hold Suribachi.

523
01:02:52,872 --> 01:02:55,773
Permit me to die with honor with my men.

524
01:02:56,108 --> 01:02:57,268
No, Colonel.

525
01:02:57,944 --> 01:02:59,275
This is an order!

526
01:03:04,717 --> 01:03:05,877
Adachi.

527
01:03:08,054 --> 01:03:09,214
Adachi!

528
01:03:22,134 --> 01:03:26,161
Sir, Captain Tanida
requests machine guns.

529
01:03:28,307 --> 01:03:29,604
It's over.

530
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:38,944
Suicide...

531
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:42,287
That's the only thing left.

532
01:03:43,222 --> 01:03:44,211
But...

533
01:03:45,558 --> 01:03:48,550
Here, take this to your commander.

534
01:04:33,506 --> 01:04:37,135
I heard General Kuribayashi
order Colonel Adachi to escape.

535
01:04:37,309 --> 01:04:38,333
Quiet!

536
01:04:41,881 --> 01:04:45,146
Escape is the coward's way.

537
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:47,546
Sit down!

538
01:04:59,699 --> 01:05:00,791
Men...

539
01:05:03,669 --> 01:05:04,727
we are...

540
01:05:07,573 --> 01:05:09,905
honorable soldiers of the Emperor.

541
01:05:13,646 --> 01:05:15,170
Don't ever forget that.

542
01:05:19,351 --> 01:05:21,251
The only way left for us...

543
01:05:23,189 --> 01:05:25,089
is to die with honor.

544
01:05:28,861 --> 01:05:30,351
This is our fate...

545
01:05:32,031 --> 01:05:34,363
to find our place at Yasukuni Shrine.

546
01:05:39,438 --> 01:05:41,099
I'll see you there.

547
01:06:00,893 --> 01:06:02,884
Soldiers, farewell!

548
01:07:58,177 --> 01:07:59,235
Stop!

549
01:08:06,852 --> 01:08:10,413
You should die like an honorable soldier.

550
01:08:11,323 --> 01:08:12,847
Look, Shimizu...

551
01:08:15,594 --> 01:08:18,392
we can still join the troops
in the northern caves.

552
01:08:19,365 --> 01:08:22,027
Our orders are to stay here until death.

553
01:08:22,201 --> 01:08:24,032
I heard General Kuribayashi himself.

554
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:26,831
That's what he said...

555
01:08:28,674 --> 01:08:30,005
over the radio.

556
01:08:31,443 --> 01:08:32,705
It's true.

557
01:08:36,882 --> 01:08:39,043
We can die here...

558
01:08:40,686 --> 01:08:43,211
or we can continue fighting.

559
01:08:46,625 --> 01:08:49,526
Which would better serve the Emperor?

560
01:08:52,398 --> 01:08:53,888
Which one?

561
01:09:16,088 --> 01:09:17,453
Where does this go?

562
01:09:17,623 --> 01:09:19,921
It will take us closer to Motoyama.

563
01:09:25,998 --> 01:09:27,829
Do you have orders to move back?

564
01:09:29,268 --> 01:09:31,236
Where are the rest of your men?

565
01:09:31,737 --> 01:09:33,068
All dead.

566
01:09:34,606 --> 01:09:36,471
It's the same with us.

567
01:09:44,483 --> 01:09:46,747
There should be an outlet
somewhere near here.

568
01:09:46,952 --> 01:09:48,112
Be quiet!

569
01:10:35,834 --> 01:10:40,669
So you thought you could blow us up,
or burn us alive, did you?

570
01:10:56,355 --> 01:10:58,687
- Have we heard from Suribachi?
- No, sir.

571
01:10:58,857 --> 01:11:00,381
Send a messenger!

572
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:12,359
Lieutenant Oiso has ordered us
to rendezvous at the east cave.

573
01:11:20,546 --> 01:11:23,515
We will make a run for Motoyama.

574
01:11:24,216 --> 01:11:26,844
There is no cover for two kilometers.

575
01:11:27,586 --> 01:11:30,214
It will be every man for himself.

576
01:11:36,895 --> 01:11:38,726
See you on the other side.

577
01:11:39,398 --> 01:11:43,198
If not on this earth,
then in the next world.

578
01:11:58,150 --> 01:12:00,812
Don't run with the herd.
That's where the enemy will fire.

579
01:12:00,986 --> 01:12:02,214
Stay back.

580
01:12:03,021 --> 01:12:04,386
That's cowardice!

581
01:12:06,325 --> 01:12:09,852
There is no use for a dead soldier.

582
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:41,952
Wait until the flare is gone.

583
01:13:08,086 --> 01:13:09,815
Crawl forward.

584
01:13:28,307 --> 01:13:29,831
What happened to the messenger?

585
01:13:30,075 --> 01:13:31,474
He never came back.

586
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:37,072
I will go to Adachi myself.

587
01:13:37,349 --> 01:13:40,477
Motoyama's transmitter
still works, General.

588
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,620
Why not try there, sir?

589
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:06,701
Sir, these men retreated
from Mt. Suribachi.

590
01:14:13,819 --> 01:14:15,184
What are your names?

591
01:14:15,487 --> 01:14:18,012
Saigo, from the 312th.

592
01:14:18,657 --> 01:14:20,181
Shimizu, reporting for duty.

593
01:14:22,361 --> 01:14:24,352
You escaped from Suribachi?

594
01:14:30,836 --> 01:14:32,861
How dare you!

595
01:14:34,773 --> 01:14:37,708
It was your duty
to stay in your position until death.

596
01:14:40,012 --> 01:14:41,570
You should have died...

597
01:14:42,514 --> 01:14:44,880
with your fellow troop members.

598
01:14:46,084 --> 01:14:49,918
You are both a disgrace.

599
01:14:54,059 --> 01:14:55,549
Get on your knees.

600
01:14:58,196 --> 01:15:00,892
- But, sir...
- I said, get on your knees!

601
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:23,553
I don't want you to kill
my soldiers needlessly.

602
01:15:25,257 --> 01:15:26,815
Put down your sword.

603
01:15:27,326 --> 01:15:28,657
Put it down!

604
01:15:35,067 --> 01:15:36,591
What's going on here?

605
01:15:38,937 --> 01:15:43,135
These men ran from Suribachi.

606
01:15:45,644 --> 01:15:50,479
Lt. Ito, I gave the order that all survivors
retreat to the north caves.

607
01:15:52,818 --> 01:15:54,479
I am very sorry, General.

608
01:15:56,755 --> 01:15:57,983
It's just...

609
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:00,758
Suribachi...

610
01:16:03,128 --> 01:16:04,527
has fallen.

611
01:16:25,851 --> 01:16:27,512
Now that Suribachi has been taken...

612
01:16:27,686 --> 01:16:30,086
the enemy will maneuver all forces
onto the hillside.

613
01:16:30,255 --> 01:16:32,280
We must move
our command center north, sir.

614
01:16:38,663 --> 01:16:39,789
Ito...

615
01:16:41,933 --> 01:16:44,128
fight for your fallen brethren...

616
01:16:45,971 --> 01:16:47,666
until the end.

617
01:17:10,229 --> 01:17:11,696
Get up!

618
01:17:15,968 --> 01:17:18,027
Major General Hayashi
is leading an attack.

619
01:17:18,203 --> 01:17:19,795
We are to join him.

620
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:25,741
Kuribayashi's orders are
to remain in the caves.

621
01:17:28,247 --> 01:17:32,547
Lieutenant lto says Kuribayashi
is a weak American sympathizer.

622
01:17:42,461 --> 01:17:45,294
We will take back Mt. Suribachi.

623
01:18:07,419 --> 01:18:09,444
Where is Major General Hayashi?

624
01:18:12,024 --> 01:18:13,389
We don't know, sir.

625
01:18:14,026 --> 01:18:15,459
Who is in charge here?

626
01:18:15,694 --> 01:18:17,594
I'm not sure.

627
01:18:20,766 --> 01:18:23,098
Stay here until
I determine the plan of action.

628
01:18:48,861 --> 01:18:50,351
We're dead.

629
01:18:56,335 --> 01:18:58,462
Pull back!

630
01:18:59,004 --> 01:19:00,835
We'll get reinforcements.

631
01:19:33,172 --> 01:19:38,007
Why didn't your regiment join the attack?

632
01:19:42,047 --> 01:19:43,742
Don't sit here like rats!

633
01:19:44,616 --> 01:19:48,211
Come out of your caves and fight!

634
01:19:50,022 --> 01:19:51,580
Where is your commander?

635
01:19:51,757 --> 01:19:53,622
We haven't received the order to attack.

636
01:19:57,296 --> 01:20:00,060
Didn't you receive the order
from General Hayashi?

637
01:20:01,467 --> 01:20:04,561
Kuribayashi countermanded
Hayashi's order.

638
01:20:05,104 --> 01:20:07,038
There is to be no attack.

639
01:20:10,709 --> 01:20:12,870
We will take back Suribachi...

640
01:20:13,812 --> 01:20:15,439
with or without Kuribayashi.

641
01:20:16,148 --> 01:20:19,379
There are already troops on the attack.
Get your men in order.

642
01:20:19,551 --> 01:20:22,179
Lieutenant, may I remind you
of your rank!

643
01:20:22,387 --> 01:20:24,753
Your disrespect for senior officers...

644
01:20:25,591 --> 01:20:28,389
puts your men at needless risk.

645
01:20:30,429 --> 01:20:32,420
I suggest you go back to your cave...

646
01:20:32,598 --> 01:20:36,466
or hand over your men.

647
01:20:46,678 --> 01:20:47,906
Enough.

648
01:20:48,313 --> 01:20:50,042
We'll do it ourselves.

649
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:02,525
That's against regulations.

650
01:21:02,861 --> 01:21:06,456
That's the officer who tried to kill us.
He doesn't care.

651
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:39,995
I won't go back.

652
01:21:42,034 --> 01:21:44,229
I've had enough of cave fighting.

653
01:21:46,471 --> 01:21:49,338
You men are now under
Lieutenant Colonel Nishi's command.

654
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:03,285
I will throw myself under an enemy tank.

655
01:22:06,892 --> 01:22:09,417
I will take out one of their machines.

656
01:22:38,056 --> 01:22:39,284
Hurry.

657
01:22:41,693 --> 01:22:43,092
What is the status?

658
01:22:44,896 --> 01:22:46,625
A thousand men were lost...

659
01:22:46,798 --> 01:22:48,698
in a night attack along Chidori airfield.

660
01:22:48,867 --> 01:22:51,631
Why? I have given them strict orders
not to kill themselves.

661
01:22:51,803 --> 01:22:55,569
It seems that the order to retreat
was not conveyed to all sectors.

662
01:22:56,441 --> 01:22:57,703
Hayashi.

663
01:22:58,210 --> 01:22:59,541
Damn you!

664
01:23:00,612 --> 01:23:02,102
And the American advancement?

665
01:23:02,714 --> 01:23:06,480
A battalion is headed north and we
are fighting back along the west ridge.

666
01:23:06,652 --> 01:23:10,918
Good. Once they cross the west ridge,
they will be surrounded on three sides.

667
01:23:12,324 --> 01:23:13,621
This just arrived.

668
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,918
Read it.

669
01:23:19,898 --> 01:23:21,422
From headquarters...

670
01:23:23,602 --> 01:23:28,266
"We regret that we are unable to send
reinforcements to lwo at this time.

671
01:23:29,675 --> 01:23:33,167
We earnestly hope you will
fight honorably...

672
01:23:33,945 --> 01:23:36,140
and die for your country."

673
01:25:18,216 --> 01:25:19,308
Bring him in.

674
01:25:35,133 --> 01:25:36,122
Bring him in.

675
01:25:46,578 --> 01:25:48,739
Shall I finish him off?

676
01:25:49,481 --> 01:25:51,472
No. Treat him.

677
01:25:52,918 --> 01:25:54,146
But, sir...

678
01:25:54,319 --> 01:25:56,947
Okubo, you would expect the same,
wouldn't you?

679
01:25:57,122 --> 01:25:58,419
Endo, treat him.

680
01:25:58,824 --> 01:26:01,622
We are low on morphine as it is.

681
01:26:03,094 --> 01:26:05,927
Sir, the Americans would not treat
a wounded Japanese soldier.

682
01:26:06,097 --> 01:26:09,066
Son, have you ever met one?

683
01:26:10,602 --> 01:26:11,728
Treat him.

684
01:26:49,207 --> 01:26:51,300
Where are you, American tanks?

685
01:26:52,377 --> 01:26:54,004
Come and get me!

686
01:27:09,661 --> 01:27:11,288
How is the prisoner doing?

687
01:27:11,796 --> 01:27:13,127
He is awake, sir.

688
01:27:17,068 --> 01:27:20,231
I will question the prisoner
for information.

689
01:29:06,778 --> 01:29:08,006
Damn.

690
01:29:10,382 --> 01:29:11,872
I've had enough of this.

691
01:29:12,617 --> 01:29:14,175
I'm going to surrender.

692
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:20,824
Go ahead and arrest me.

693
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:25,826
I don't care anymore. That's what
you were put here for, isn't it?

694
01:29:27,232 --> 01:29:29,700
To report treasonous thoughts.

695
01:29:34,205 --> 01:29:36,002
I was put here because...

696
01:29:37,475 --> 01:29:39,568
I was discharged from the Kempeitai.

697
01:29:42,847 --> 01:29:44,007
Discharged?

698
01:29:48,653 --> 01:29:51,918
I had only been in service
for five days.

699
01:29:55,193 --> 01:29:56,251
Shimizu...

700
01:29:56,428 --> 01:29:59,192
you must always be firm.

701
01:30:00,331 --> 01:30:04,529
Any mercy and people
will take advantage of you.

702
01:30:10,041 --> 01:30:11,201
That's unpatriotic.

703
01:30:11,509 --> 01:30:13,033
Go sort it out, Shimizu.

704
01:30:25,724 --> 01:30:28,557
You do not have the lmperial flag
properly displayed.

705
01:30:28,727 --> 01:30:29,955
I'm sorry.

706
01:30:30,128 --> 01:30:33,655
My husband has gone to war
and I couldn't put it up myself.

707
01:30:33,832 --> 01:30:36,528
It is unpatriotic
not to have the flag displayed.

708
01:30:36,701 --> 01:30:38,965
If you help me, I'll put it up now.

709
01:30:59,491 --> 01:31:01,425
Get that dog to shut up.

710
01:31:02,994 --> 01:31:04,188
What was that, sir?

711
01:31:05,330 --> 01:31:09,596
That dog is a nuisance.
It is disruptive of Army communications.

712
01:31:10,168 --> 01:31:12,227
I am very sorry, sir.

713
01:31:18,610 --> 01:31:20,703
Shimizu. Dispose of the dog.

714
01:31:22,013 --> 01:31:25,574
We can't have a dog interfering
with important military commands.

715
01:31:31,356 --> 01:31:32,983
Take the dog in the back.

716
01:31:33,324 --> 01:31:34,689
It's only a dog.

717
01:31:34,926 --> 01:31:37,486
It won't happen again.

718
01:31:37,962 --> 01:31:39,361
Take it out back.

719
01:31:39,864 --> 01:31:41,525
Keep the children inside.

720
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:43,962
Hurry up.

721
01:32:32,283 --> 01:32:34,581
Take the dog into the house
and keep him quiet...

722
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:36,309
and never let him out.

723
01:32:48,499 --> 01:32:50,023
It's taken care of, sir.

724
01:33:28,406 --> 01:33:30,306
Are you trying to make a fool out of me?

725
01:33:32,176 --> 01:33:37,478
If you can't even shoot a dog,
you'll never be able to handle the Reds.

726
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:40,649
You are unpatriotic!

727
01:33:46,891 --> 01:33:49,257
I was discharged for insubordination...

728
01:33:50,461 --> 01:33:52,156
and sent here.

729
01:34:00,972 --> 01:34:02,735
Don't look so glum, Shimizu.

730
01:34:04,275 --> 01:34:06,903
At least now only the enemy hates you.

731
01:34:12,016 --> 01:34:13,779
I don't blame the dog.

732
01:34:39,544 --> 01:34:40,704
Taro...

733
01:34:41,145 --> 01:34:44,046
tonight I attended my farewell party.

734
01:34:44,682 --> 01:34:47,207
The wives also attended,
so there was a lot of fuss.

735
01:34:47,385 --> 01:34:50,320
Greeting all the ladies...

736
01:34:50,555 --> 01:34:53,683
kept me from enjoying the food.

737
01:37:38,789 --> 01:37:40,814
Is there any information
of the enemy's plan?

738
01:37:41,626 --> 01:37:43,821
No, it's just a letter.

739
01:37:45,696 --> 01:37:47,493
It's from his mother.

740
01:37:49,967 --> 01:37:51,025
"Sam...

741
01:37:52,069 --> 01:37:54,435
I have mailed you
a couple of books to read.

742
01:37:55,039 --> 01:37:56,563
I hope that you like them.

743
01:37:57,975 --> 01:37:58,964
Yesterday...

744
01:37:59,710 --> 01:38:04,477
the dogs dug a hole under the fence.

745
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:10,082
They ran all over the neighborhood.

746
01:38:11,189 --> 01:38:13,384
By the time we found them...

747
01:38:14,592 --> 01:38:19,586
the Harrisons' roosters were terrorized.

748
01:38:20,398 --> 01:38:23,231
Don't worry about us.

749
01:38:24,502 --> 01:38:28,563
Just take care of yourself
and come back safely.

750
01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:32,671
Remember what I said to you...

751
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:37,907
always do what is right...

752
01:38:39,016 --> 01:38:41,211
because it is right.

753
01:38:42,386 --> 01:38:46,049
I pray for a speedy end to the war...

754
01:38:46,224 --> 01:38:47,623
and your safe return.

755
01:38:49,227 --> 01:38:50,558
Love, Mom."

756
01:39:25,229 --> 01:39:27,823
I'm sorry, sir. There is no more medicine.

757
01:39:27,999 --> 01:39:31,162
It's all right. I'm useless now.
Go help the others!

758
01:41:02,526 --> 01:41:04,551
Okubo, come here.

759
01:41:11,268 --> 01:41:13,031
How are we on ammunition?

760
01:41:15,106 --> 01:41:17,540
Not good, sir.

761
01:41:19,076 --> 01:41:21,044
Our mortars have been taken out...

762
01:41:21,846 --> 01:41:23,711
and we're out of machine gun ammo.

763
01:41:25,516 --> 01:41:28,849
We have only our rifles.

764
01:41:30,921 --> 01:41:31,910
Okubo...

765
01:41:32,089 --> 01:41:35,889
you are now in charge of the men.

766
01:41:40,631 --> 01:41:42,223
We can no longer hold this area.

767
01:41:42,967 --> 01:41:46,459
You must guide
the rest of the men north.

768
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:52,541
Take whatever food and ammo
we have left.

769
01:41:53,711 --> 01:41:56,077
What about you, sir?

770
01:41:59,483 --> 01:42:02,919
I'm tired of sharing this cave
with all of you.

771
01:42:03,754 --> 01:42:06,279
I'm a one-man show from here on out.

772
01:42:06,624 --> 01:42:08,387
What are you talking about, sir?

773
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:13,059
Your first order of business...

774
01:42:14,098 --> 01:42:15,827
is to find some water.

775
01:42:42,827 --> 01:42:43,987
Men...

776
01:42:45,463 --> 01:42:47,090
do your best.

777
01:42:48,599 --> 01:42:53,002
Do what is right...

778
01:42:54,839 --> 01:42:57,103
because it is right.

779
01:42:59,276 --> 01:43:00,504
Understood?

780
01:43:08,319 --> 01:43:13,279
I will make sure that they send you
medicine and food.

781
01:43:15,526 --> 01:43:16,857
It has been a great honor...

782
01:43:18,295 --> 01:43:19,523
to serve...

783
01:43:20,831 --> 01:43:22,298
under you.

784
01:44:01,438 --> 01:44:02,996
Hand me my rifle.

785
01:44:26,797 --> 01:44:28,697
I'm sorry, Okubo.

786
01:45:48,812 --> 01:45:52,009
Why am I not getting any reports?
Have we heard from Admiral Ichimaru?

787
01:45:52,182 --> 01:45:54,946
- No, sir.
- What about Nishi or Hayashi?

788
01:45:57,388 --> 01:46:00,448
- Send out messengers!
- We have. Many times.

789
01:46:00,691 --> 01:46:02,420
None of them have come back.

790
01:46:02,926 --> 01:46:04,689
You can't plan strategy like this!

791
01:46:15,873 --> 01:46:19,365
I have been thinking about
what Lt. Colonel Nishi said.

792
01:46:20,144 --> 01:46:21,543
He's right.

793
01:46:26,817 --> 01:46:29,718
I don't know anything about the enemy.

794
01:46:30,487 --> 01:46:34,150
I believed that the Americans
were cowards...

795
01:46:40,297 --> 01:46:42,060
but they weren't.

796
01:46:47,304 --> 01:46:49,465
I was taught...

797
01:46:51,108 --> 01:46:52,837
that they were savages...

798
01:46:54,645 --> 01:46:56,613
but that American soldier...

799
01:47:04,121 --> 01:47:06,248
his mother's words...

800
01:47:10,194 --> 01:47:12,321
were the same as my mother's.

801
01:47:13,530 --> 01:47:17,523
I want to fulfill my duty
for the general...

802
01:47:18,435 --> 01:47:20,596
and our country...

803
01:47:22,339 --> 01:47:24,466
but I don't want to die for nothing.

804
01:47:30,481 --> 01:47:31,846
What do you think?

805
01:47:44,061 --> 01:47:45,153
You...

806
01:47:46,463 --> 01:47:49,227
haven't lived enough to realize...

807
01:47:54,071 --> 01:47:56,539
what you are sacrificing.

808
01:48:04,882 --> 01:48:07,077
Will you surrender with me?

809
01:48:28,505 --> 01:48:29,836
Careful.

810
01:48:33,443 --> 01:48:37,243
They'll notice if we leave together.
You go first.

811
01:48:38,215 --> 01:48:39,978
I'll make up an excuse.

812
01:48:40,150 --> 01:48:42,778
After a while, I'll tell them
I'm going to check on you.

813
01:48:42,953 --> 01:48:44,944
We'll be gone before they even notice.

814
01:48:48,358 --> 01:48:50,383
Pretend that you have dysentery.

815
01:48:51,228 --> 01:48:53,458
Give me your dysentery look.

816
01:49:03,407 --> 01:49:05,068
I guess that'll have to do.

817
01:49:14,051 --> 01:49:15,609
Where are you going?

818
01:49:15,953 --> 01:49:17,580
I've got dysentery.

819
01:49:18,055 --> 01:49:19,989
You're going to surrender, aren't you?

820
01:49:20,157 --> 01:49:22,250
If you are, take me with you.

821
01:49:22,893 --> 01:49:25,487
- I've had enough of this war.
- Be quiet!

822
01:49:33,971 --> 01:49:36,462
Where are you going?

823
01:49:36,707 --> 01:49:39,175
He said he wasn't feeling well.
It could be dysentery.

824
01:49:39,343 --> 01:49:40,605
You two! Stop!

825
01:49:46,383 --> 01:49:47,680
Sir, maybe they got spooked.

826
01:50:04,968 --> 01:50:07,436
Miura, you're on guard.

827
01:50:08,105 --> 01:50:10,096
Make sure we have no more deserters.

828
01:51:36,393 --> 01:51:38,020
What unit were you with?

829
01:51:40,864 --> 01:51:44,766
Higashiyama 314th.

830
01:51:54,478 --> 01:51:55,911
Did you hear...

831
01:51:57,614 --> 01:52:01,209
I heard that they would give you a meal.

832
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:04,448
A meal...

833
01:52:08,625 --> 01:52:10,320
That sounds good.

834
01:52:15,332 --> 01:52:16,993
I'm from Yokohama, too.

835
01:52:20,437 --> 01:52:23,736
After this is over, you can come visit me.

836
01:53:40,050 --> 01:53:41,244
Lieutenant!

837
01:54:22,893 --> 01:54:24,690
Let this be a lesson to anyone else...

838
01:54:26,930 --> 01:54:28,557
who wants to surrender.

839
01:55:41,471 --> 01:55:45,339
We need to get through the crossfire
to reach the north...

840
01:55:46,209 --> 01:55:47,904
and join our forces at the front.

841
01:55:53,950 --> 01:55:55,042
Listen.

842
01:55:56,119 --> 01:55:58,610
We'll head for that cave
and make our way from there.

843
01:56:02,158 --> 01:56:03,716
Don't waste a bullet!

844
01:56:04,894 --> 01:56:06,327
Not a single one.

845
01:56:06,896 --> 01:56:08,454
Don't shoot recklessly.

846
01:57:09,125 --> 01:57:13,186
These are Nishi's troops
and the survivors from Suribachi.

847
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:19,268
Are there no officers?

848
01:57:23,106 --> 01:57:25,370
You all did a good job making it here.

849
01:57:26,443 --> 01:57:28,104
Fujita, water for them.

850
01:57:32,749 --> 01:57:35,650
I'm sorry, sir. There is no more water.

851
01:57:39,489 --> 01:57:40,581
I'm sorry.

852
01:57:41,925 --> 01:57:43,256
At least you can rest.

853
01:57:58,441 --> 01:58:00,068
You look familiar.

854
01:58:05,315 --> 01:58:06,907
You almost lost your head.

855
01:58:09,953 --> 01:58:14,014
That was the second time you saved me.

856
01:58:16,826 --> 01:58:18,259
The first time...

857
01:58:18,962 --> 01:58:22,591
was the day you landed on the island.

858
01:58:26,369 --> 01:58:28,303
Of course. I remember.

859
01:58:29,973 --> 01:58:31,600
Well, everything happens in threes.

860
01:58:48,291 --> 01:58:49,622
Hanako...

861
01:58:50,660 --> 01:58:53,060
This letter will probably
never get to you...

862
01:58:53,797 --> 01:58:54,786
but...

863
01:58:55,498 --> 01:58:57,728
it comforts me to write.

864
01:58:59,202 --> 01:59:01,727
For five days, we've been
without water and food.

865
01:59:03,039 --> 01:59:04,802
To survive...

866
01:59:06,576 --> 01:59:08,635
we do unspeakable things.

867
01:59:11,648 --> 01:59:13,479
There is no escape now.

868
01:59:14,250 --> 01:59:15,410
But...

869
01:59:16,653 --> 01:59:19,486
my only concern is for you and the baby.

870
01:59:26,029 --> 01:59:27,587
Dig up some worms.

871
01:59:46,683 --> 01:59:49,379
The battle is approaching its end...

872
01:59:49,953 --> 01:59:52,683
and there is no more ammunition,
no more water.

873
01:59:52,856 --> 01:59:56,348
All the survivors will engage
in a general attack.

874
01:59:57,694 --> 02:00:01,130
I pray for the victory
and safety of the Empire.

875
02:00:01,731 --> 02:00:03,858
I bid you farewell.

876
02:00:05,535 --> 02:00:09,596
For the country,
I could not fulfill all of my duties.

877
02:00:09,772 --> 02:00:13,708
Now that we have no ammunition,
it is with regret that we must perish.

878
02:00:20,216 --> 02:00:23,379
You made it all the way from Suribachi?

879
02:00:26,289 --> 02:00:28,484
That must have been quite a journey.

880
02:00:34,230 --> 02:00:35,822
You are quite a soldier.

881
02:00:38,167 --> 02:00:39,566
No, sir.

882
02:00:40,637 --> 02:00:41,968
I'm just a simple baker.

883
02:00:42,772 --> 02:00:44,569
You were a baker?

884
02:00:46,075 --> 02:00:47,133
Any family?

885
02:00:48,177 --> 02:00:49,474
A wife...

886
02:00:50,079 --> 02:00:54,641
and a baby girl born
last summer in Ohmiya.

887
02:00:58,121 --> 02:00:59,748
I haven't met her yet.

888
02:01:06,029 --> 02:01:07,428
It's strange.

889
02:01:09,999 --> 02:01:13,526
I promised myself to fight
until death for my family...

890
02:01:15,438 --> 02:01:19,772
but the thought of my family
makes it difficult to keep that promise.

891
02:01:43,166 --> 02:01:45,134
A radio transmission from the homeland.

892
02:01:58,815 --> 02:02:00,282
For General Kuribayashi...

893
02:02:00,450 --> 02:02:04,819
and his troops, who are fighting bravely
for our country...

894
02:02:04,988 --> 02:02:09,584
a song will be sung by the children of
Nagano, which is Kuribayashi's hometown.

895
02:02:09,926 --> 02:02:14,056
On the waves of the Pacific

896
02:02:14,230 --> 02:02:17,495
down south from the Imperial City

897
02:02:18,034 --> 02:02:22,698
a small lonely island floats

898
02:02:26,109 --> 02:02:29,738
The fate of our Imperial country

899
02:02:29,912 --> 02:02:34,576
lies in the hands of this island

900
02:02:37,387 --> 02:02:40,015
Iwo Jima

901
02:02:43,559 --> 02:02:47,051
As long as we stand

902
02:02:47,530 --> 02:02:51,626
we shall feel safe, as the Imperial land

903
02:02:51,801 --> 02:02:56,465
shall forever be at peace

904
02:02:59,742 --> 02:03:04,406
We shall fight with pride
and honor at any price

905
02:03:06,816 --> 02:03:10,377
Our proud island

906
02:03:10,987 --> 02:03:13,649
Iwo Jima

907
02:03:35,978 --> 02:03:37,309
Do me a favor.

908
02:03:38,981 --> 02:03:42,747
Stay here and burn all these documents,
and my military chest.

909
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:46,081
Everything happens in threes.

910
02:04:15,551 --> 02:04:17,576
We will make a general attack.

911
02:04:18,654 --> 02:04:20,986
Although Japan has lost...

912
02:04:21,724 --> 02:04:23,589
one day...

913
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:26,587
our people will praise your dedication.

914
02:04:27,730 --> 02:04:31,757
A day will come when they
will weep and pray for your souls.

915
02:04:34,470 --> 02:04:36,768
Be proud to die for your country.

916
02:04:43,913 --> 02:04:46,404
I will always be in front of you.

917
02:07:29,226 --> 02:07:30,454
No more.

918
02:07:32,663 --> 02:07:33,652
No more.

919
02:07:41,739 --> 02:07:43,434
Thank you, Fujita.

920
02:08:15,573 --> 02:08:16,733
This is an order.

921
02:09:25,209 --> 02:09:26,403
You again.

922
02:09:29,880 --> 02:09:33,646
I have one more favor to ask of you.

923
02:09:35,719 --> 02:09:36,913
Bury me...

924
02:09:38,055 --> 02:09:40,046
so that no one will find me.

925
02:09:54,638 --> 02:09:55,627
Taro...

926
02:09:56,073 --> 02:09:57,506
I will be home soon.

927
02:09:58,776 --> 02:10:00,767
I'm glad to be going back to Japan...

928
02:10:01,745 --> 02:10:05,146
but I'm a bit sad
to leave my friends behind.

929
02:10:08,619 --> 02:10:10,177
I drove home...

930
02:10:11,322 --> 02:10:12,311
but...

931
02:10:12,756 --> 02:10:15,350
it's lonely driving all by myself.

932
02:10:27,805 --> 02:10:29,796
Is this still Japanese soil?

933
02:10:39,316 --> 02:10:41,045
This is still Japan.

934
03:04:04,226 --> 03:04:05,591
Be careful.

935
03:10:31,379 --> 03:10:33,370
