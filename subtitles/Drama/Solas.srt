0
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,111
ALONE

1
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,389
See you later.

2
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,669
-Hello.
-Hello.

3
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,359
I'm glad you're here.

4
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,957
Your mother worries me
more than your father.

5
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,718
-She fainted again.
-Got a smoke?

6
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,672
There's no smoking here.

7
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,199
I'll smoke it later.

8
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,398
She seems very sad.

9
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,237
It must be from fatigue
and being here.

10
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,912
It's none of my business...

11
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,793
-She's too old for this.
-She wants to stay.

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,753
-lf you stayed with your father...
-No, I can't.

13
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,679
-You can't, or...?
-I can't.

14
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,550
-Only child?
-One of four.

15
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,599
What about the others?

16
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,270
They've all
gone up north.

17
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,115
Far away.

18
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,839
As far as they could.

19
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,395
Come, mother.

20
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,430
Thank you, doctor.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,718
The operation went well,

22
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,309
we'll take a look
when he wakes up.

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,434
If you want, you can call
tonight to see how he is.

24
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,429
But listen.

25
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,839
You can't stay here.

26
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,870
-You'll get ill yourself.
-Let's go.

27
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,717
Goodbye.

28
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,710
Mother...

29
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,550
Let's get the bar's
phone number

30
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,070
so the hospital can find us.
I know the owner.

31
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,269
You go.

32
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,634
-Why not you?
-There are lots of men.

33
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,871
This isn't the village.
Thank God it's not.

34
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,799
A brandy, fat man.
I'll pay you later.

35
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,113
You owe me a lot.

36
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,714
Do me a favor...
Put the bottle down!

37
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,353
My father's in the hospital.

38
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,912
Can I give them
your number?

39
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,237
Of course,
what are friends for?

40
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,512
-How's your dad?
-Thanks.

41
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,114
A drink on the house.

42
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,877
Here, this is the number.
Don't lose it.

43
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,753
The bathroom's here.

44
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,475
-Coffee?
-My doctor says I can't have it.

45
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,671
-Since when?
-A long time ago.

46
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,309
Don't mind the apartment.
I just moved in.

47
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,749
I'll change
the sheets for you.

48
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,311
-Where will you sleep?
-On the sofa bed.

49
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,597
-I don't mind the sofa bed.
-I do.

50
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,472
Let me do it.

51
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,314
The doctor said
I shouldn't stay

52
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,792
in the hospital,
but with my family.

53
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,832
He didn't have to.

54
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,719
Feel at home here.

55
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,832
Stay as long
as you need to.

56
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,233
It's stuffy in here.
It smells like mildew.

57
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,509
Smells?

58
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,949
It stinks!

59
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,190
-Open the windows.
-What for?

60
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,038
The smell's in the walls.

61
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,033
Even I have that smell.

62
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,589
From Isabelita.

63
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,833
She wants you
to be the godmother.

64
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,309
She's not baptized?

65
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,153
They're waiting.

66
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,438
Her mother just died.

67
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,716
I sent a telegram
to tell you about it,

68
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,390
but it was
to your old address.

69
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,555
When?

70
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,876
She died February 18th,

71
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,199
a week after
Isabelita had the baby.

72
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,674
I moved in January.

73
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,510
She lasted long enough
to see her granddaughter.

74
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,519
Isabelita always
asks about you.

75
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,878
She'd love it
if you were the godmother.

76
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,318
When do you go
to the hospital?

77
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,309
1:30 tomorrow.

78
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,952
It's usually clean.

79
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,832
You should pick up
after you shower.

80
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,071
The right one's hot.

81
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,710
I'm going out.

82
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,115
I have a job interview.

83
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,437
I made you an omelet
and there's soup.

84
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,632
There's no milk or fruit.

85
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,553
I never eat here.

86
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,192
I won't be gone long.

87
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,515
And your food?

88
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,312
I'll eat later.

89
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,669
You're thin.

90
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,710
A little.

91
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,995
And the hospital?

92
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,874
I'll call later.

93
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,674
Do it from the bar.

94
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,558
Don't stay out long,

95
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,475
this neighborhood
is dangerous.

96
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,316
Do you need anything?

97
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,110
Where are the clothespins?

98
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,237
Don't open the door
to anyone.

99
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,675
Come on.

100
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,754
You know the way?

101
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,034
-Maybe we can see your father...
-Not me.

102
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,913
Remember to catch
this bus going back.

103
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,759
He's as strong as an ox.

104
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,276
He's sleeping perfectly,
stitches and all.

105
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,835
-How are you?
-Fine, thank you.

106
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,599
He asked for you.

107
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,510
He doesn't like you being
with your daughter.

108
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,878
-ls there any problem?
-No.

109
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,589
Things happen.

110
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,395
I understand.

111
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,674
I'll let you see him.
Maybe you can calm him down.

112
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,992
-Ana, she's going to go in.
-Thank you.

113
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,278
The doctor told me to go,

114
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,594
that I wasn't needed.

115
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,989
Maria wanted me

116
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,078
to go to her place
to rest...

117
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,079
But I can stay here
if you want.

118
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,795
Stupid old woman!

119
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,990
Shit!

120
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,115
Shit!

121
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,077
I told you not to eat it.

122
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,793
And you go out

123
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,115
and do it here!

124
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,115
And I have
to clean up your shit!

125
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,399
Goddamnit!

126
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,068
-Excuse me.
-lt's all right.

127
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,069
-I can dry it off.
-You don't need to.

128
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,995
-I really am sorry.
-lt happens to me, too.

129
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,794
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, and sorry.

130
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,873
Look at this mess.
Next time,

131
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,513
you clean it up!

132
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,070
The neighbors will say
we're two old pigs!

133
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,469
You're late.

134
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,109
-Any problems?
-I caught the wrong bus.

135
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,039
Why did you buy that?

136
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,553
I went by the supermarket
and you needed things.

137
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,670
I'll pay you.

138
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,836
You don't have to.

139
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,109
Yes, I do.

140
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,875
They can't say
I take money from you.

141
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,314
-You got the job?
-Yes.

142
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,833
-Doing what?
-What do you think?

143
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,314
Cleaning up

144
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,359
other people's shit.

145
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,348
You don't have to be ashamed.
I did that for 12 years.

146
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,710
What? Don't give me
your life

147
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,035
as an example.

148
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,989
It's all I have.

149
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,430
Keep it.
Mine is enough for me.

150
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,519
If he doesn't set a date for
the wedding, tell him to fuck off.

151
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,870
I should have
already done that.

152
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,359
-What about the trousseau?
-Sell it.

153
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,790
All the linen is monogrammed.

154
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,070
You're so old-fashioned.

155
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,676
Hello,

156
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,195
come in.

157
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,830
Everything has
to be ready by 7:00.

158
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,508
Call me if there's
any problems.

159
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,312
Start with this room.

160
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,471
Can we take the leftovers?

161
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,876
You can from the table,

162
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,036
but don't touch the kitchen.

163
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,793
You don't want any?

164
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,434
There isn't much left.

165
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,714
That's all there is.

166
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,353
If you don't want it,
give it to me.

167
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,391
You're proud
for a poor girl.

168
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,556
Hey! Don't touch that!

169
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,517
I don't want drunks here!

170
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,591
Let us have a drink, boss.

171
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,109
What a killjoy!
Let's toast.

172
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,914
-Your health!
-Let's toast to this spread.

173
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,555
-Here.
-None left.

174
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,875
Here, come on.

175
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,356
Drink, girl, drink.

176
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,750
-A brandy.
-Hell, 5,000 pesetas!

177
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,313
Brandy, coming up!

178
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,079
Paying your debt?

179
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,599
Leave me bus money.

180
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,920
And give me a lottery ticket.

181
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,116
Only your drink
and the ticket.

182
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,317
The rest when you're rich.

183
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,315
What happened?

184
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,277
I got a blister

185
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,873
at a party.

186
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,631
I'll put something on it.

187
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,948
Come on, it'll get infected.

188
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,479
Let's see your hand.

189
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,359
What kind of party was that?
Here...

190
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,956
I'll put on some peroxide
and you'll be fine.

191
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,875
How's your wife?

192
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,919
She can hardly move.

193
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,312
Having twins is hard.

194
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,238
Raising them will be...

195
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,994
Who's with her?

196
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,158
My mother-in-law.
That's what she needs.

197
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,033
Waiter!

198
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,991
This one's on me.

199
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,317
-Six tapas and 12 beers.
-Not 12 beers!

200
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,953
-I kept track.
-You're wrong.

201
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,037
-I'm wrong?
-4 beers too many.

202
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,959
I won't argue
over four fucking beers.

203
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,515
The fucker's trying
to rob us!

204
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,154
Let's leave.

205
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,316
Don't come here again!

206
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,315
Goddamn him!

207
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,320
If I wanted to steal,
I'd go to a bank,

208
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,475
that way I could get rich!

209
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,274
I wouldn't steal
some idiot's last penny!

210
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,999
Goddamn...

211
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,077
Sorry, Maria. Those bastards
piss me off.

212
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,954
-Okay, fat man. I have to go.
-Wait.

213
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,151
-I'll buy you a drink.
-Another time.

214
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,315
Maria...

215
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,032
It's awful having kids.

216
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,155
It puts your wife
out of service.

217
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,715
That's good.

218
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,509
Get yourself ready
for when she's better.

219
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,792
Ready, Don Emilio?

220
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,514
I like this piece,
but I'm not sure.

221
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,634
Let me know when you decide.

222
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,115
Fine, don't worry about me.

223
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,593
-The loin is fresher.
-For a stew?

224
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,430
For how many?

225
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,399
Just one.

226
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,999
Get a half pound.

227
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,353
1,785 pesetas.

228
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,398
Take out the cheese.

229
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,235
-I can't, it's cut to order.
-Of course.

230
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,994
-The roast...
-Don't take out anything.

231
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,955
How much?

232
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,037
Pay me back later, Madam.

233
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,634
How much, Julia?

234
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,469
-How much have you got?
-1,400 and...

235
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,309
30 more...

236
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,519
You need

237
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,952
-355 more.
-Put it on my bill.

238
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,630
-I'll pay you as soon as I get back.
-Whenever you want.

239
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,233
Thank you, Miss.

240
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,199
And you, too.
I'll give it right back.

241
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,035
That lady's not from here.

242
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,589
She just arrived,
she's strange...

243
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,554
-What have you got today?
-Let's see. The wine...

244
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,190
Some beef loin...

245
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,949
Vegetables...

246
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,115
Another plant?

247
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,512
And when you go?

248
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,553
I'll leave them.
Plants are good company.

249
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,320
I don't have time
to look after them.

250
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,552
-Just water them...
-I had some, they died.

251
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,636
Well...

252
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,998
I'll find a place for them.

253
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,275
The doctor says your dad
can go to a room tomorrow.

254
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,108
The doctor takes good

255
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,754
care of your father.

256
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,029
It's his job.

257
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,389
He has a good heart.

258
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,557
It's easy with money.

259
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,311
Many rich people
don't have one.

260
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,717
Neither do the poor.
No one has a good heart.

261
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,554
Especially here.

262
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,549
Everyone here just looks
out for their own pocket.

263
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,715
-Good and bad people are everywhere.
-Tell me another day.

264
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,837
Some respect for your mother!

265
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,431
But you say some things...

266
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,915
You're just
like your father.

267
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,349
Then leave him.

268
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,715
Want me to go?

269
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,356
-I didn't say that.
-I asked you.

270
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,191
I said you could stay.

271
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,228
I have to go now.

272
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,349
Don't get your hands wet
and put a bandage on them.

273
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,912
-Have you see Juan?
-He's over there.

274
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,916
Are you fucking crazy?

275
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,599
-I did the test.
-And?

276
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,795
I'm pregnant.

277
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,151
Fucking hell! I told you
to take the pills!

278
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,549
What about condoms?

279
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,557
I don't like condoms.

280
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,313
You can't get pregnant.

281
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,995
This is fucked,

282
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,950
baby.

283
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,189
I don't want problems.

284
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,948
I'll pay if you want
an abortion...

285
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,309
I won't have your child.

286
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,789
Fucking great.

287
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,870
Paco...

288
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,955
How did your girl
do her abortion?

289
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,589
She went to

290
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,438
see a social worker.

291
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,232
-How much was it?
-Nothing.

292
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,595
Free, too.

293
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,910
But if you need cash,
I'll help.

294
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,793
Are we set?

295
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,713
I'll be back
in a couple of days.

296
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,753
Want money for coffee?

297
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,950
You don't?

298
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,436
Well...

299
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,552
Give me a kiss.

300
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,189
-Hello. Your money, thank you.
-You didn't have to hurry.

301
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,834
It was just a few cents.
Come in.

302
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,479
-Are you cooking?
-Yes, my stew.

303
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,990
-lt's burning.
-Damnit! Goddamnit!

304
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,110
Goddamnit to hell!

305
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,389
Your money.

306
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,989
Did you get burned?

307
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,873
-A little.
-You left it on.

308
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,600
-What's this?
-Potato and meat stew.

309
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,189
For you or for the dog?
Excuse me...

310
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,432
No, not even Achilles
could eat it.

311
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,755
All day

312
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,837
cooking, and for nothing!

313
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,950
I'll make something.

314
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,675
No, thank you.

315
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,155
-Some rice?
-Don't bother.

316
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,551
Rice? There's some here.

317
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,794
-Have you got tomatoes?
-No, thank you.

318
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,834
In the fridge...

319
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,277
You're going to cook now?

320
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,149
This was a nice

321
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,351
area, but the young people

322
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,189
moved out and now only
us old people are left.

323
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,755
Some cheese?

324
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,798
-lt's good.
-No.

325
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,237
I've already eaten.
Salt?

326
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,839
The owners made
smaller apartments,

327
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,349
and they rented them out

328
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,358
to people from the villages,
poor people,

329
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,395
bums, drug addicts,
prostitutes...

330
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,953
The scum of the city.

331
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,915
Not everyone, you're daughter
isn't like that.

332
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,670
By the way,

333
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,995
what's her job?

334
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,392
Damn gossipy old man.

335
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,718
Is that any of my business?

336
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,110
It's a professional defect.

337
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,351
We retired people are bored,

338
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,676
so we spy on other people.

339
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,354
At a cleaning company.

340
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,714
She's smart
and wanted to study,

341
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,511
but her father said no.
He's old-fashioned.

342
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,630
I understand.

343
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,909
You have no family?

344
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,673
No, I'm not from here.

345
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,989
I'm from La Felguera,

346
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,595
in Asturias.

347
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,910
I've lived here for years
but since my wife died,

348
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,754
I have no one,
here or there.

349
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,590
Achilles!

350
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,473
Achilles,
like the Roman emperor.

351
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,352
I think he was Roman...

352
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,313
He's an old friend...

353
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,637
the only one I have left...

354
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,713
And my bodyguard.

355
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,599
Touch me.

356
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,475
Quiet!

357
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,713
Now I'll touch you.

358
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,230
Now he sees
you're my friend.

359
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,074
Pet him and say
something nice.

360
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,635
He's an old fool
that likes affection.

361
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,992
You're very pretty

362
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,674
and very grumpy.

363
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,792
And very clever, too.
Watch what he does.

364
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,269
Here, Achilles.

365
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,157
He likes to go out a lot.

366
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,391
Achilles, the door!

367
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,116
He's an old scoundrel.

368
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,510
Inés, give me a cigarette.

369
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,554
-Finished upstairs?
-Yes.

370
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,115
Stay here. I'm sick
of being alone.

371
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,833
-And her?
-She won't talk.

372
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,349
-She hasn't changed?
-Not at all.

373
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,950
And I can't work like that,
silent all night.

374
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,235
Bastards!

375
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,229
You're all bastards!

376
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,273
Bastards!
Bastards!

377
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,832
-Calm down, girl.
-Bastards!

378
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,952
Calm down...

379
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,597
-Fourteen.
-Fourteen.

380
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,838
-Nine.
-9 years with my boyfriend.

381
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,793
-9 more if you're not careful.
-I know.

382
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,275
-Twenty-one.
-Twenty-one.

383
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,153
-Thirty-two.
-Thirty-two.

384
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,476
-Seventeen.
-Seventeen...

385
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,114
-My age when I first got laid.
-And...?

386
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,152
It was over in two seconds.

387
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,035
One left.

388
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,435
Thirty-eight.

389
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,954
Thirty-eight...

390
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,550
-Rhymes with...
-Masturbate.

391
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,517
You're so vulgar!

392
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,035
Here...

393
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,270
You look like a skeleton.

394
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,717
-Are you going to play?
-Let her eat first.

395
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,317
She can give me numbers
while she eats.

396
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,989
What's wrong?

397
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,113
You're pale, Maria.

398
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,669
I fell asleep.

399
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,119
Where's that chair from?

400
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,190
Downstairs,
it was thrown out.

401
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,108
It's in good condition.

402
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,759
Go to bed, it's late.

403
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,759
Want some food?

404
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,836
No.

405
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,196
-Some warm milk?
-No.

406
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,272
You have to eat.

407
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,708
Don't be a pain.

408
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,750
Who's it for?

409
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,748
The doctor's baby.

410
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,550
Will he pay you?

411
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,435
It's a gift.

412
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,879
Because he's so nice.

413
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,236
It keeps me busy.

414
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,149
You're so naive.

415
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,155
If you say so.

416
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,590
I say I'm going to bed.

417
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,318
I've got some aloe vera.

418
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,838
-Rosemary or flower scent?
-Rose water.

419
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,429
Go to sleep.

420
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,675
I've got delicate
rich girl's hands.

421
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,716
Right...

422
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,468
You always said that.

423
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,677
I should have been rich.

424
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,638
You didn't want to work.

425
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,354
Who does?

426
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,110
People should
be born twice.

427
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,352
Once rich and once poor.

428
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,231
So the rich will know poverty,

429
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,435
and the poor can enjoy life.

430
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,396
What if you
had another life?

431
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,635
Me?

432
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,472
If I had another life,

433
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,871
I'd only change one thing.

434
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,709
Give me one.

435
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,756
Here.

436
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,713
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

437
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,319
-Hello.
-Hello.

438
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,669
Look at this.

439
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,190
I'm bad with meat, but
I'm great at buying fish.

440
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,310
Looks fresh.

441
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,399
Looks? This bass swam
right to the fish shop.

442
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,278
It died in my hands.

443
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,673
Something this good

444
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,913
needs a good cook.

445
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,309
Well... I can cook it if I
get back early from the hospital.

446
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,635
What time?

447
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,435
It doesn't matter,
I'll wait.

448
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,592
I could be very late.

449
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,634
If it's not for lunch,
then for tea.

450
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,440
We'll have tea and bass.

451
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,391
Come on, we have a lot to do.

452
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,240
Don't be afraid,
we changed his room.

453
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,839
Come with me.

454
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,713
He's in good shape.

455
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,952
-Ana.
-Yes?

456
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,919
Take her to his room.

457
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,191
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

458
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,513
You're better, right?

459
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,355
Come closer.

460
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,870
Where were you?

461
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,710
In your daughter's place.

462
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,514
I smell men.

463
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,279
South Zone Health Center.

464
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,669
To the right.

465
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,996
-No smoking.
-Where do I put it out?

466
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,791
When's your appointment?

467
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,109
Maria Martinez.

468
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,715
That's me.

469
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,069
Make sure you
call me Sunday.

470
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,435
Take care.

471
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,550
Maria?

472
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,155
Come in.

473
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,075
SOCIAL WORKER

474
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,068
That's dull.

475
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,828
Where's my knife?

476
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,030
All right! Be patient.

477
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,355
Let's go.

478
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,034
Mother?

479
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,511
-Check the filters.
-I did last week.

480
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,280
-Well, check them again.
-All right.

481
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,719
-Hi, Miguel.
-Hi.

482
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,350
Is there
any hot water left?

483
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,915
-The Jacuzzi's ready.
-Here.

484
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,755
The mechanic's
checking the filter.

485
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,354
-She knew we came today?
-You told her.

486
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,709
What's up, shorty?

487
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,070
-Can we talk?
-Of course.

488
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,273
Give me a kiss first.

489
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,395
You have to eat
a little more.

490
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,229
Come on.

491
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,117
-Hello.
-Hello.

492
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,512
Some soup and potatoes.

493
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,756
Thanks. You didn't have to.

494
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,599
I stayed at the hospital.

495
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,429
I thought so.

496
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,313
-Come in.
-No, thank you.

497
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,318
-I have things to do.
-Of course.

498
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,033
-Enjoy the food.
-Thank you.

499
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,275
Goodbye.

500
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,195
Goodbye.

501
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,276
What are you looking at?

502
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,152
There's no privacy here.

503
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,310
Well...

504
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,795
What is it?

505
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,438
They'll do the abortion
next week.

506
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,235
Great! Does it cost anything?

507
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,759
-No.
-There you go.

508
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,192
Fast and free. Women
can't complain now.

509
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,719
My mom almost died

510
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,797
from an illegal abortion,

511
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,035
and paying for it.

512
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,189
I want you to come.

513
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,630
What for?

514
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,510
I'm afraid.

515
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,310
You?

516
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,115
Of what? It's
too late for that.

517
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,759
If I could, I would,

518
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,037
but we're

519
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,753
leaving on Monday.

520
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,754
Your Mom will go.

521
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,149
She doesn't know.

522
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,028
Well, tell her.

523
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,114
I never will.

524
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:37,911
Why not?

525
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,115
Because.

526
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,110
She didn't knock me up.

527
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,798
The father could be anyone...

528
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,918
-Bastard!
-Knock it off or you'll get it!

529
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,235
Will you go or not?

530
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,754
I told you I can't.

531
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,075
Besides,

532
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,237
I have to pay for the truck,

533
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,959
I need this job.

534
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,478
I have to work, too.

535
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,753
Don't worry,
I'll talk to your boss.

536
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,269
All right?

537
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,153
Come on, relax!

538
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,554
Everything's okay.

539
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,470
Come here. Come.

540
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,075
Come on...

541
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,549
Suck it like
you know how to.

542
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,316
Suck me the way I like.

543
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,119
-Be good.
-I want to have the baby.

544
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,756
What?

545
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,674
Are you crazy?

546
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,753
What are you saying?

547
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,868
-With the two of us...
-No! Okay?

548
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,112
I said so from the start.

549
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,556
-We could try...
-What? Try what?

550
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,916
Talk, don't stare at me.

551
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,789
Nothing to say?

552
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,314
I'll talk, then.

553
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,993
If you want a dick,

554
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,394
you can use mine.

555
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,957
But that's all we have.

556
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,549
Is that clear?

557
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,314
One more thing:

558
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,229
to be a mother,

559
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,477
you have to be a woman.

560
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,869
You're only half woman,
the other half is alcohol.

561
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,909
Shorty...

562
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,269
Between us...

563
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,279
things have
always been clear.

564
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,438
I never promised anything.

565
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,432
If you want a husband,
look somewhere else.

566
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,629
Think about it.

567
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,991
A child isn't a whim.

568
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,793
It's a mistake.

569
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,470
-A child isn't a mistake.
-No.

570
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,075
The mistake
is a mother like you.

571
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,679
Think about it.

572
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,470
Fuck you,
you son of a bitch!

573
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,359
-Hello.
-Hello.

574
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,276
You can

575
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,708
use my telephone.

576
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,111
I don't need to.

577
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,392
-Thank you. Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

578
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,313
The food was delicious,
we ate it all...

579
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,749
Achilles and I.

580
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,229
Hold on, your dishes.

581
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,676
Here.

582
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,754
Thank you.

583
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,830
Poor woman.

584
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,111
Doesn't she look sad?

585
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,959
Let's go inside.

586
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,149
Who is it?

587
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,875
I'm here with your daughter.

588
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,031
I told you not to knock.

589
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,709
-Here's the keys, see them?
-Yes, I see them.

590
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,355
Now what?

591
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,110
You woke up my mom,
what will she think of me?

592
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,552
-Who cares what she thinks?
-Don't shout...

593
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,070
I'll shout if I want to,
this is my home!

594
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,596
Or isn't it? Answer!

595
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,632
-lsn't it?
-Come to bed.

596
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,909
I don't want to!

597
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,717
Give dad orders sometime.

598
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,639
He's got balls.

599
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,357
He raises a finger
and you shit yourself.

600
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,792
They all have balls.

601
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,391
I'll cut them off!

602
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,075
-That's enough.
-Leave her to me.

603
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,278
You sure? I'm used
to dealing with drunks.

604
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,393
So am l, don't worry.

605
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,428
She has a temper,

606
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,194
but she's good...

607
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,596
-What happened?
-I told her not to drink so much.

608
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,234
-Something had to happen.
-Let's get her to bed.

609
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,915
Come closer.

610
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,549
Closer, damnit!

611
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,154
Afraid I'll smell you?

612
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,359
You never stop?

613
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,795
I like it.

614
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,633
Who's it for?

615
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,229
-The doctor...
-He's a bastard.

616
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,835
Don't say that.

617
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,429
All doctors are bastards.

618
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,594
They do what
they want with you.

619
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,389
Are we alone?

620
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,390
Yes.

621
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,349
I was thinking
of the past...

622
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,228
Have I been a good man?

623
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,196
Yes.

624
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,033
You hit me sometimes.

625
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,596
But have I acted
like a man?

626
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,752
We always had food.

627
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,428
As a man? Have I been
a good man?

628
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,033
What do you mean?

629
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,353
Forget it...

630
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,114
Stupid old woman,

631
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,753
you never understand.

632
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,151
It's late to ask that.

633
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,792
He must not have
an easy conscience. I do.

634
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,311
-Does it hurt?
-A little.

635
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,835
-Want to see the doctor?
-No.

636
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,792
You must be exhausted.

637
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,469
I'll stay today.

638
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,116
-You don't have to work?
-Not anymore.

639
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,993
A permanent vacation.

640
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,115
-He won't want you to.
-Ask him.

641
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,510
Sooner or later

642
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,836
it had to happen.

643
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,072
He knows that.

644
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,630
Be careful.

645
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,273
Let him be careful.

646
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,471
Woman!

647
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,830
Where the hell are you?

648
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,475
May I?

649
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,835
Are you here?

650
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,679
The bathroom...

651
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,669
What's wrong?

652
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,232
I'm all right.
I want to wash myself.

653
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,829
Something I ate
gave me diarrhea.

654
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,396
-I'll call the doctor.
-I just want to wash myself.

655
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,716
-Don't touch me...
-You need help.

656
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,989
No, I don't.

657
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,072
For God's sake!

658
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,552
I'm too old for
this foolishness.

659
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,429
Seeing a naked old man
won't kill me.

660
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,593
-I reek of shit!
-The pigs smell worse.

661
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,997
But I wash and
feed and care for them,

662
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,760
and sleep with them
if I need to!

663
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,189
Come on...

664
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,796
Some nice hot water...

665
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,639
Into the shower!

666
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,718
"The cat washes itself,

667
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,152
and the unwashed child
turns into a frog..."

668
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,391
Now you have to croak.

669
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,071
Come on, croak.

670
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,271
-Croak...
-Louder!

671
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,630
Croak...

672
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,476
Too hot!

673
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,515
Sorry...

674
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,794
I'm not hungry.

675
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,675
Want it?

676
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,876
-You're not hungry?
-No.

677
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,434
You eat it.

678
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,509
Thank you...

679
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,311
-Can I see the magazine?
-Of course.

680
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,236
You did that out of pity
for a poor old man.

681
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,228
What poor old man?

682
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,869
Why, then?

683
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,439
We're neighbors.

684
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,639
Neighbors help one other.

685
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,830
Of course.

686
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,598
So why do you ask?

687
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,510
We're leaving in a few days.

688
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,073
Why don't you go
to a nursing home?

689
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,510
To live with other
old people? No.

690
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,989
I'll stay in my own home.

691
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,634
I just ate
something bad earlier.

692
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,510
But I'm strong,
I'll show you...

693
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,438
No, you don't have to.

694
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,837
I know you're strong...
and stubborn. Come on.

695
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,268
You can go to bed.

696
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,078
I hate how old people smell.

697
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,348
Every age has its smell.

698
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,236
But old people reek
of piss.

699
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,069
Smell me.

700
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,908
What do I reek of?

701
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,675
Of piss?

702
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,309
It's late,
I have a lot to do.

703
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,555
Goodnight.

704
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,678
-Who's waiting for you?
-Nobody...

705
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,831
My daughter.

706
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,712
And you have to rest.

707
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,315
Goodnight.

708
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,509
If you need me,

709
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,153
bark loudly.

710
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,554
You're a good dog.

711
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,434
Goodnight, you two.

712
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,389
Goodnight.

713
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,518
Make sure to come
by tomorrow. I'll still

714
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:05,869
be a little sick.

715
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,995
And the bass is
in the freezer.

716
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,552
Well, if I can,

717
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,469
I'll cook it.

718
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,592
But I may not be able to.

719
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,155
If not tomorrow,
another day.

720
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,392
Goodbye.

721
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,115
Defeat is not
the enemy's triumph,

722
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,711
admitting the defeat is.

723
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,275
What do you say?

724
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:56,709
Want something?

725
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,429
Hello.

726
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,635
Hello.

727
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,350
-What's this for?
-They're going to examine me.

728
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,193
-Where's your daughter?
-I sent her away.

729
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,309
How do you feel?

730
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,669
I smell man on you.

731
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,918
Men from the bus...

732
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,509
You always stink
of the same one.

733
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,515
Well...

734
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,595
Let's see
if you can go tomorrow.

735
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,554
This will just take
a second.

736
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,909
Does this hurt?

737
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,276
And this?

738
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,592
It depends if you can
get house calls.

739
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,397
Grandma?

740
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,436
I'm talking.

741
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,308
-Sorry.
-ls there a medical center

742
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,635
near your house?

743
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,239
Yes, there is.

744
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,236
Perfect.

745
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,671
You can leave tomorrow
if you want to.

746
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,670
If you think there's
no problem,

747
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,271
I'd like to get out of here.

748
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,549
-I have a lot to do.
-But you can't work.

749
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,239
You have to rest.

750
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,799
I won't work, but...

751
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,389
I have to look

752
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,953
after what's mine.

753
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,152
This silly dog got

754
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,952
nervous when he heard you.

755
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,916
-Are you okay?
-Just a bit tired.

756
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,714
-I can make you some tea.
-No, thank you.

757
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,234
Your blood pressure...

758
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,595
-I can measure it for you.
-There's no need.

759
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,870
I just need to rest a bit.

760
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,799
My husband leaves
the hospital tomorrow.

761
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,788
I'm glad for him...

762
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,589
and for you.

763
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,309
I'll come by to say goodbye.

764
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,909
Yes, please do that.

765
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,356
Don't go without calling.

766
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,952
Let's go inside.

767
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,509
What stitch is that?

768
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:58,874
A straight one.

769
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,793
To the right and back.

770
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,476
-With a crochet needle?
-A number 3.

771
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,229
Another gift?

772
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,510
No,

773
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,189
this one's for you.

774
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,999
A sleeveless cardigan.

775
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:15,949
I saw a girl with one

776
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,513
in the hospital.

777
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,149
Try it on.

778
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,992
Tomorrow you dad gets out...

779
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,316
and we'll return
to the village.

780
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,268
It looks good on you.

781
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,079
What do you say?

782
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,919
It's very pretty.

783
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,676
I'll put the buttons on

784
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,838
tomorrow.

785
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,673
When I see Isabelita,

786
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,474
she'll ask if you'll
be the godmother.

787
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:15,875
What do I say?

788
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:19,630
When is it?

789
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,149
In a month.

790
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,354
Tell her I will.

791
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,313
She'll be happy.

792
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,999
She wants to see you.

793
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,354
Come on, eat

794
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,629
the omelet.

795
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,069
I'm not hungry.

796
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,749
Eat it!

797
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,509
Wait a minute.

798
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,113
Achilles, stay.

799
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,679
-Hello.
-Hello.

800
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:44,749
My daughter.

801
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,914
If you need anything,

802
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:50,270
-call her.
-Thank you.

803
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,511
Likewise, I live here.

804
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,433
I'm going to the bar,

805
01:07:58,880 --> 01:07:59,995
I'll wait there.

806
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:07,351
Madam,

807
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,797
it's been a pleasure.

808
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,636
In the few days
I have left,

809
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,110
in my many lonely hours
before me,

810
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,550
you will be
a pleasant memory.

811
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,037
Your words are touching.

812
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,191
Goodbye.

813
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,671
-I'll accompany you.
-Don't bother.

814
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,552
It's no bother.

815
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,075
On the contrary.

816
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:37,073
After seeing me naked,
my arm scares you?

817
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,349
Your wife was lucky,
you're good.

818
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,198
No, I made her suffer.

819
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:47,790
-Did you love her?
-Yes, but even so...

820
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,912
-You ever hit her?
-For God's sake, no!

821
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,755
I was right,
you're a good man.

822
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:02,958
Can I write to you?

823
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,515
I can't read.

824
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,070
-Can I call you?
-I have no phone.

825
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,000
-Do your neighbors?
-No.

826
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:16,868
Will you come back?

827
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,269
I don't know.

828
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,030
If you do,
will you visit me?

829
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,428
Yes, of course.

830
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,399
I wish you health.

831
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:29,989
Can I visit you?

832
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:32,115
Stop.

833
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,073
We're acting like kids.

834
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,555
Take care.

835
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,637
You're a very good dog.

836
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,239
You'll visit me?

837
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,359
Yes, I will,

838
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,109
don't worry.

839
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,555
I'll visit you.

840
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:53,355
Behave yourself.

841
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:55,635
Goodbye.

842
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,669
See you soon!

843
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,471
-Two coffees, right?
-Right.

844
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:05,749
And two brandies.

845
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,029
Right away.

846
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,673
-There.
-Well done.

847
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,915
Of course.

848
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,280
-Have I ever done it badly?
-Right.

849
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,474
How much is
a bottle of whisky?

850
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,349
Depends which.

851
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:29,749
3Dyc3, for example.

852
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,313
-Your change.
-Thanks.

853
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,431
For you, 1,000 pesetas.

854
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:35,789
Wholesale.

855
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,155
You want six?

856
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:43,790
No...

857
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,439
The other day...

858
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,039
Forget it.

859
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:51,198
If you're really sorry,
I'll forgive you.

860
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,873
Don't do it again.

861
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,915
I'll buy you a drink, okay?

862
01:10:58,560 --> 01:10:59,709
For being good.

863
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,478
Fuck you, fat man.

864
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,315
What number won?

865
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,911
23567.

866
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:21,033
Shit! My daily disappointment.
Another 200 pesetas wasted.

867
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,117
It could be worse.

868
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,436
Let's have another drink.

869
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,953
A toast.

870
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,476
-How's your hand?
-Better.

871
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:35,874
You're tough.

872
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,594
-Going back to the village?
-Yes, sir.

873
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,598
-Have a good trip.
-Thanks.

874
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,075
Two, please.

875
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:57,869
Not that one,

876
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,788
the seven's better.

877
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:03,433
Luck comes from
where you least expect it.

878
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,229
Bye, Manuel.

879
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,712
-Here.
-You keep them.

880
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,797
-Not both. Take one.
-No.

881
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,672
You need luck more than I.

882
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,597
-Go in and say goodbye.
-Don't insist, mother.

883
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,672
He doesn't want to see me.

884
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,039
If he's angry,
he'll take it out on you.

885
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,035
We already said goodbye once,
there's no need to repeat it.

886
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,628
I wish I could have

887
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,316
spent more time with you.

888
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,589
With me?

889
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,719
Don't get me wrong,

890
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,833
I'm worried about you.

891
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,308
And the kitchen
needs to be painted.

892
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,636
Forget about the kitchen.

893
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,149
You won't go in?

894
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,156
I like how you smell, mother.

895
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,676
That's from your dad, too.

896
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,594
-What?
-Smelling people.

897
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,756
What else is from him?

898
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:12,229
Your bad temper.

899
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,348
Take care.

900
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,909
-Doctor?
-Yes.

901
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,509
-A lady's here to see you.
-Show her in.

902
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,354
Since the analysis
hasn't changed,

903
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,714
keep giving him
250 milligrams.

904
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:48,188
-What's up?
-I have a present for you.

905
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,116
No.

906
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,594
I can't.

907
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,076
-Please accept it.
-lt's against my principles.

908
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,479
At least look at it.

909
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,315
Well...

910
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,039
This is beautiful!

911
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,633
A piece of art!

912
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,359
My wife will love it.

913
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:16,829
Thank you.

914
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,191
-Sorry, what's your name?
-Rosa Jiménez Peña.

915
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,714
Thank you, Rosa.

916
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,716
-You have him ready?
-Yes.

917
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,037
I'll come say goodbye.

918
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:27,997
All right.

919
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,428
-Bye.
-I'll be right there.

920
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,436
-Hello.
-Hello.

921
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:13,959
Your mother
was going to cook it,

922
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:17,153
now I don't know
what to do with it.

923
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:20,196
I don't feel like eating it,

924
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,799
so I'll give to you.

925
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,553
It's yours.

926
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,309
Is that coffee?

927
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:29,636
Yes.

928
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,390
-lt's burning.
-Shit!

929
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:47,989
Some coffee?

930
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,755
The old woman's senile.

931
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:00,993
Laughing to herself!

932
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,954
Better laugh than grumble.

933
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,957
-What do you mean?
-Nothing.

934
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:09,630
My grandma said it's as easy
to smile as to grumble.

935
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:19,716
The ambulance will take you home.
You have my number,

936
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:20,796
okay?

937
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,916
Why do you complain so much?

938
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:26,477
Have you suffered so?

939
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:29,035
Right, you're old,
you know more.

940
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:30,719
I didn't say that.

941
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,348
But I am older.

942
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,752
If I add up all my bad luck,
I may beat you.

943
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:36,790
Maybe not.

944
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,788
Look, it's absurd to fight
about who's suffered more.

945
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:44,959
What I am sure about

946
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:47,071
is that I'm worse off

947
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,477
because my time is over,

948
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:50,869
and you, girl,

949
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,119
have a lot ahead.

950
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:55,593
We can agree on that,

951
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:56,870
can't we?

952
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,396
I buy food
every day, so as

953
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,636
not to buy for the week.

954
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,877
A plan for more than

955
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,877
two days is too much.

956
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,638
Don't be tragic, neighbor.

957
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,239
You're the tragic one.

958
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:12,834
Stop gabbing,

959
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,314
let's play cards.

960
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:27,152
But no betting just
cigarettes or matches.

961
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,198
100 pesetas the game.

962
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:32,989
500.

963
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:35,788
-You'll lose lots, Miss.
-I'm generous.

964
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,070
But don't call me 3Miss3.

965
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,039
All right, neighbor.

966
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,830
I've worked
in six houses here,

967
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:52,590
and all the housewives
say the same thing:

968
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,553
3lt's so hard
to find good help3.

969
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,996
But then they pay shit.

970
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,993
They want hard work
for bad pay.

971
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,395
-Don't exaggerate.
-I'm not.

972
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:07,755
-You get what you pay for.
-Fine, don't get excited.

973
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:09,758
I only want to explain

974
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,996
that I can't afford help.

975
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,398
Okay, fine. But you
could pay someone

976
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,750
to come for a couple hours.

977
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:19,749
I don't like that.

978
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:21,952
-Why not?
-I don't know.

979
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:23,798
They come for two hours,

980
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,429
clean the place, and go.

981
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:27,830
It's so...

982
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,109
Cold?

983
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:30,955
More or less.

984
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:34,118
You want them to sing
and dance for you?

985
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,436
No, just I don't like it.

986
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:38,870
You don't want a maid.

987
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,594
-You wany company.
-Perhaps.

988
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:42,915
More expensive.

989
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:47,239
Come on. I'm talking about
friendship, you can't buy that.

990
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,596
You can buy anything now.

991
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,229
-You want to count it?
-No.

992
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,995
My old man did
teach me cards.

993
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,434
You owe me 3,500.

994
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,715
This looks good!

995
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,069
My first bass.

996
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:13,074
My father gambled
what we earned

997
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,713
in the fields.

998
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,912
The bastard got the money
and went to play.

999
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,669
If we complained

1000
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,156
he'd beat
the hell out of us.

1001
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,599
My brothers left
when they could.

1002
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,510
My sister married quickly,

1003
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:32,195
a mistake...

1004
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,510
And I stayed

1005
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,594
a bit longer.

1006
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:36,994
You didn't marry?

1007
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:38,309
I was demanding.

1008
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:41,070
I didn't want
to be like my mom.

1009
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,279
And I had bad luck.

1010
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,752
I didn't like many men,

1011
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,715
the one I did married
my best friend.

1012
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,599
And with all the men

1013
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,428
in this city...?

1014
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,473
You're a gossip.

1015
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:56,193
Sorry, forgive me.

1016
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,038
-lt's okay.
-I call it...

1017
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,159
A professional defect.

1018
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:03,034
We retired people
have nothing to do,

1019
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:04,753
so we gossip.

1020
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:08,473
Don't worry,
I'm having fun.

1021
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,309
A little gossip is healthy.

1022
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,114
In the village

1023
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:14,948
I hated it,
but here

1024
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,591
there's no one to talk to.

1025
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,633
You hold it all in,

1026
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,669
and it ends up burning
in your gut.

1027
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:25,355
You know what?

1028
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,035
Here's to gossip!

1029
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,119
What did you ask?

1030
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:36,555
Right...

1031
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:39,031
If I'd met any men here.

1032
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,389
A few.

1033
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,197
I fell for the worst one.

1034
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:48,755
After spending my life trying
to avoid what my mother did...

1035
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,234
He knocked me up

1036
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:55,391
and told me to fuck off.

1037
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,918
You shouldn't smoke.

1038
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,594
Nor drink so much.

1039
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:40,675
You mother knows?

1040
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:43,475
No one knows.

1041
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,348
Now I know.

1042
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:46,909
You don't matter.

1043
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,112
-You're just a neighbor.
-Neighbors

1044
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,197
are here to help
each other.

1045
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:54,149
How?

1046
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,631
I don't know. Listening.

1047
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:58,195
And that helps?

1048
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,239
So it won't burn

1049
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:02,709
in your gut.

1050
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,794
What will you do?

1051
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:12,509
I'm going

1052
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:13,869
to a clinic

1053
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,315
for an abortion.

1054
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:18,955
I'm afraid.

1055
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,679
I'm against abortion.

1056
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:23,829
You won't have one.

1057
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,633
Still, I'm against it.

1058
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,149
I don't give a shit.

1059
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,198
It's my problem, I decide.

1060
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:36,509
You're afraid?

1061
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:42,196
Of everything.

1062
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:46,230
Of it hurting,
of going alone...

1063
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,117
of not being sure about it.

1064
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,109
Then have the baby.

1065
01:24:58,480 --> 01:24:59,913
That's easy to say.

1066
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:03,997
A baby is serious.
It's not a dog.

1067
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,352
Achilles is serious.

1068
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,073
But he isn't a baby.

1069
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,716
Don't treat dogs like people.

1070
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,036
People are

1071
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:15,913
dying of hunger
and dogs eat well.

1072
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:19,510
Some dogs are nobler
and friendlier than people.

1073
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:20,391
Refering to me?

1074
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:21,997
Yes.

1075
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,315
Go to hell.

1076
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,313
All you know about me

1077
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,478
is that I'm pregnant.

1078
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,151
Men knock us up, and
we have to deal with it.

1079
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:32,556
Look...

1080
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:36,112
I grew up in a house
of six with no bathroom,

1081
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,954
my dad was a drunk
who beat my mom.

1082
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:41,674
When he had no excuse...
Excuse? Fuck!

1083
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:45,157
She never gave
that bastard an excuse...

1084
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,954
But when he didn't
hit her, he hit us.

1085
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,390
Why am I telling you this?

1086
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:02,989
You're not like him.

1087
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,349
What if I was?

1088
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:12,029
If I just drank and gambled
and hit the baby?

1089
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,038
I'm going to have a child

1090
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:20,598
so it can grow up
the way I did?

1091
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,953
I can't even...

1092
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:28,839
give it a father.

1093
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,513
If you would like,

1094
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:34,988
I can go with you,

1095
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:37,950
so you won't be alone.

1096
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:41,473
There are times when

1097
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:44,428
one should forget
one's principles.

1098
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:48,676
I don't want you to come,

1099
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,915
I don't want you
to say you agree.

1100
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,678
What I want

1101
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:01,158
is for you to say
my life will change.

1102
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,432
I'm 35 years old

1103
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,158
and I want this baby.

1104
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,838
I have no magic wand,

1105
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:20,749
but I could be

1106
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:22,832
an adoptive grandfather.

1107
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:26,950
I haven't much money,
but I have my pension.

1108
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:35,595
I'm going to bed.

1109
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:37,996
We're saying stupid things.

1110
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,393
Are you crazy?

1111
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,154
Or senile?

1112
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:48,589
An adoptive grandfather?

1113
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,758
-What the hell is that?
-A little respect, Miss!

1114
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:55,396
You just said the stupidest
thing I ever heard.

1115
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:56,555
Miss,

1116
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,074
I swear to God,

1117
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,833
on my word,

1118
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:02,270
and on my late wife's grave,

1119
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:05,074
that I have
not been joking

1120
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,589
nor taking lightly a topic

1121
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,792
as delicate as
the birth of a child.

1122
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:13,310
I was completely serious.

1123
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:17,514
I just had one son,

1124
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,679
and he died young.

1125
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,035
So you can understand

1126
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,237
I never had grandchildren,

1127
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,631
I was never a grandfather.

1128
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:32,838
All I am trying
to communicate to you

1129
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,235
is I'd love to be
a grandfather,

1130
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:39,319
and I would be willing
to assume the responsibility

1131
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,476
that would correspond to me.

1132
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,239
That's all.

1133
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,674
I've seen some
strange things,

1134
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:00,119
but this tops all.

1135
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:04,349
My dear,

1136
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:07,110
I already told you.
At your age,

1137
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,352
you haven't seen anything.

1138
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,353
I'll think about it.

1139
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:17,389
Be quick.

1140
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:21,554
I don't even know you.
Are you drunk?

1141
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,149
Do I look drunk?

1142
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:25,998
If later you're sorry

1143
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:28,398
or I don't like you?

1144
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,796
Don't complicate things.

1145
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:34,393
You want a baby
and I want a grandchild.

1146
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,470
I'll be a normal grandfather.

1147
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:39,748
We'll go to the park,

1148
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:42,353
I'll buy him toys,

1149
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,028
I'll play with him...

1150
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:48,238
What problems could I cause?

1151
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:51,513
If you don't like me,
you tell me.

1152
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,628
Calm down,

1153
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:04,389
I'll be okay.

1154
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,433
You want some coffee?

1155
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:13,311
Camomile tea, please.

1156
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,151
I can't have coffee
this late.

1157
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:22,275
Fine, grandpa.

1158
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,357
Tonight you'll get what you want.

1159
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:31,914
It's dawn.

1160
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,199
One more day.

1161
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,316
God's given us one more day.

1162
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,994
Dear Mother,
wherever you are.

1163
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:50,796
I named her Rosa after you.

1164
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,270
She weighs 7 pounds

1165
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:55,198
and she doesn't stop eating.

1166
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,672
I work in the same place,

1167
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:59,997
that's life.

1168
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,080
My hands don't hurt anymore.

1169
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,320
And I don't have
that pain inside,

1170
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:08,990
nor do I have nightmares.

1171
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:14,675
That's thanks to you
and to this little doll.

1172
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:19,395
The adoptive grandpa
was sad when you died...

1173
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:23,436
Well, we both were sad.

1174
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:27,118
I know he wanted
to see you again.

1175
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:29,872
But we're recovering,

1176
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:33,430
thanks to your granchild,
his and yours.

1177
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,877
He's become
a father to me, too.

1178
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:38,513
But we argue a lot.

1179
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:42,156
We're both stubborn,
but we always work it out.

1180
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,268
He wants us to live
in the country,

1181
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,637
he says it's better for her.

1182
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:51,231
He'll sell his flat
and fix up our house.

1183
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,717
The old man's crazy...

1184
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,078
but wonderful.

1185
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:59,156
It's a shame he's so old.

1186
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:03,278
Speaking of men,
I'm not seeing anyone.

1187
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:07,789
I like one,
but I'm in no hurry.

1188
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:12,435
I don't want to make
another mistake.

1189
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,917
I miss you, Mother.

1190
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,796
We both miss you.

1191
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:42,359
For my mother,
for all mothers.
