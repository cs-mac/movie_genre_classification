1
00:00:01,646 --> 00:00:03,271
[Rosen]: I see a car in my rear view
mirror.

2
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:05,542
I hear footsteps behind me.
I turn around and they're gone.

3
00:00:05,662 --> 00:00:07,303
<i>Previously on "Scandal"...</i>

4
00:00:07,371 --> 00:00:08,905
She could be getting into something
possibly dangerous.

5
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:09,609
With work.

6
00:00:09,729 --> 00:00:11,407
So Albatross, the mole,
the man who killed Wendy...

7
00:00:11,474 --> 00:00:13,875
he's the one who leaked
their names to the terrorists.

8
00:00:13,943 --> 00:00:15,277
(Olivia) You can't tell anyone
it came from me,

9
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:16,978
and you can't bring it
to the C.I.A.

10
00:00:17,047 --> 00:00:19,181
An anonymous source sent them
to my office this morning.

11
00:00:19,249 --> 00:00:20,782
That meeting isn't
on my schedule.

12
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,351
It's so late at night
and three times a week.

13
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:23,919
Who is it?

14
00:00:23,986 --> 00:00:25,620
He's not cheating on me, Cy.
He's cheating on you.

15
00:00:25,688 --> 00:00:27,988
The mole is not in the agency.
The C.I.A. Is clean on this.

16
00:00:28,057 --> 00:00:29,390
Thank you, Osborne.

17
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,182
(Quinn) He can't know
we're on to him.

18
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,899
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

19
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,270
His name's Jake Ballard.

20
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:45,971
He's a naval intelligence
officer

21
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:47,506
with the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

22
00:00:47,574 --> 00:00:49,341
Put him under the microscope,
see what you find.

23
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:51,643
- The more dirt, the better.
- It'd help to know why I'm doing this.

24
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:52,744
He sleeping with
your husband?

25
00:00:52,812 --> 00:00:55,914
In a manner of speaking, yes.

26
00:00:58,318 --> 00:01:00,619
So this source of yours...
The one who gave you

27
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:03,021
the fax transmissions
on the Kashfari hostages...

28
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:04,790
Yeah?

29
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:06,992
You think there's more
blood in that stone?

30
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,894
(Pouring) There might be.
Why do you ask?

31
00:01:08,962 --> 00:01:10,762
I want you to look into it.

32
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,631
Me? Don't you have a building
in Langley that does that?

33
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:14,466
I do, but so far
all they've done

34
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,333
is rule themselves out
as the leak.

35
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:18,368
- You need some backup.
- I need some backup.

36
00:01:18,436 --> 00:01:20,170
Someone I can trust.

37
00:01:20,238 --> 00:01:23,474
Which these days...
it's a very short list.

38
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:27,678
And who knows?
If things go well,

39
00:01:27,746 --> 00:01:29,346
maybe we find a place
for you here

40
00:01:29,414 --> 00:01:30,982
that's a little more official.

52
00:02:13,473 --> 00:02:15,207
So I've been thinking...

53
00:02:15,274 --> 00:02:17,742
about your family.

54
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,910
It's just it's been a while
since you had one

55
00:02:19,978 --> 00:02:23,214
- to, you know, watch.
- Slow down.

56
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:24,275
What? The speed limit is like...

57
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:25,730
You have to keep at least
100 feet between us and them.

58
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,951
Slow down.
(Sighs)

59
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,055
Anyway, I just thought
maybe we could find you

60
00:02:31,123 --> 00:02:32,589
a new family.

61
00:02:32,657 --> 00:02:34,892
Look, I know they were
special, Huck,

62
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,526
but every family's special
in their own little way,

63
00:02:36,593 --> 00:02:38,194
- don't you think?
- He's turning left.

64
00:02:38,262 --> 00:02:40,563
Next street.
And don't forget to signal.

65
00:02:40,631 --> 00:02:42,132
When you don't signal,
it draws attention.

66
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,634
(Clicks lever, signal clicking)

67
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,039
(Breathes sharply)
So, what do you say?

68
00:02:49,106 --> 00:02:51,007
I say we've been following
Osborne for a week,

69
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:52,974
and he hasn't made a drop
the entire time,

70
00:02:53,043 --> 00:02:55,077
hasn't been to
the dry cleaners even once,

71
00:02:55,145 --> 00:02:56,711
and he's driving
a new route tonight,

72
00:02:56,779 --> 00:02:58,680
which is very, very strange.

73
00:02:58,748 --> 00:03:01,383
So, what do you see?

74
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:02,884
Osborne's on his way
to a new drop?

75
00:03:02,952 --> 00:03:04,486
Mnh-mnh.

76
00:03:04,554 --> 00:03:06,321
- We've been made?
- We've been made.

77
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:08,456
We haven't been made. What makes
you think we've been made?

78
00:03:08,524 --> 00:03:09,658
You see that apartment
building up ahead?

79
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:12,561
- Yeah. Wait, isn't that...
- Olivia's.

80
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:15,196
- We've been made.
- We've been made.

- Who hired you?

You're having me followed.

Unless you have a crush on me,
I assume there's a reason.

Do you really think we don't
have a file on you?

94
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,072
The woman who's had her finger
in every pile of dirt

95
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,408
that gets dumped on this town? It's a
damned encyclopedia. (Phone clicks)

96
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,210
Yes, I'd like to report
a break-in.

97
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,313
I asked you a question,

98
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,914
and I am waiting for an answer.

99
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,117
Check my file.

100
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,585
Half my clients have
your pay grade or higher,

101
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:16,321
which means half my clients
would happily intervene

102
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:18,189
on my behalf and kick your ass

103
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,158
in whatever special way
their office allows,

104
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,926
which is why I suggest,
Director Osborne,

105
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:23,895
you leave my apartment
immediately.

106
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:26,897
This isn't over.

107

00:04:42,813 --> 00:04:45,881
Yeah. (Sighs)

112
00:04:50,454 --> 00:04:51,820
- Wow.
- Yeah.

113
00:04:51,888 --> 00:04:53,589
Really? Nowhere else to put him?
He's safest here.

114
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:55,324
Oh, come on!

115
00:04:55,392 --> 00:04:56,659
David walked into
someone ransacking

116
00:04:56,726 --> 00:04:58,827
his apartment last night.
Oh, God, is he...

117
00:04:58,895 --> 00:05:01,563
Fine. Shaken but fine.

118
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:03,465
Do you think it was Osborne
looking for the flash drive?

119
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:05,066
I think Osborne sent someone
else to do his dirty work,

120
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:07,869
because last night the man was
too busy threatening me.

121
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:09,304
- So he's on to us?
- He's on to us.

122
00:05:09,372 --> 00:05:11,273
- So what next?
- We lie low. We back off.

123
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,107
We don't take on the director
of the C.I.A.

124
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:14,709
without solid proof
he's the mole.

125
00:05:14,777 --> 00:05:16,943
In the meantime,
we have a client coming in.

126
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:19,146
(Harrison sighs
and clears throat)

127
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:21,415
- Who's the client?
- You've been on an all-night stakeout.

128
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:23,884
Why don't you go home
and get some sleep?

129
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:25,252
I'm not tired.
I can work.

130
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,920
Wait... who's the client?

131
00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:28,955
(Door opens)
I'd apologize for being late,

132
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:30,591
but, hell, I'm not that tardy, and
I ain't that sorry. (Door closes)

133
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:33,059
Darlin', if you'd do me
the kindness

134
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:36,896
and rustle ol' Hollis up
a coffee black as Texas crude

135
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:38,531
with three sugars sweet as you,

136
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,633
I'd be much obliged.

137
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:43,336
This is my favorite ex-wife
Debora.

138
00:05:43,404 --> 00:05:46,072
All he would tell me is you're
a bunch of specialized lawyers.

139

Don't think for one second I'm

I'm afraid we got a whole other
cat to skin.

142
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,347
Please, daddy.
(Crying)

143
00:05:56,415 --> 00:05:59,517

he wants you to wire
$20 million

he says if you go

00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:30,479
Please, daddy.

158
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:33,616
I'm so scared.
I just want to come home.

159
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:36,252
Just do what he says,
or else he'll hurt me!

160
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,621
Help...
<i>(Static crackling)</i>

161
00:06:40,624 --> 00:06:43,259
Only thing she forgot to do
is thank the damn academy.

162
00:06:43,326 --> 00:06:44,793
What is the matter with you?

163
00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:46,594
Y'all weren't buying
that little performance?

164
00:06:46,662 --> 00:06:48,764
That there is nothing more
than the fruits

165
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,801
of the six years of film school,
acting class, scene study,

166
00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:55,003
and whatever in hell else
Maybelle wanted to take

167
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:56,537
and I was a damn fool
to pay for.

168
00:06:56,605 --> 00:06:58,073
I had myself a good ol' laugh

169
00:06:58,141 --> 00:07:00,274
when I got it in my mail
last night.

170
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:03,177
You have been sitting on this
since last night?

171
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:06,413
Our daughter, our... baby
has been kidnapped,

172
00:07:06,481 --> 00:07:09,116
and you waited 12 hours
to tell anyone?!

173
00:07:09,184 --> 00:07:10,785
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking) Maybelle Doyle, 25,

174
00:07:10,852 --> 00:07:12,253
youngest of Hollis'
eight children

175
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,121
and only daughter with his
fourth ex-wife,

176
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:16,389
Manhattan power player
Debora Clarkson.

177
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:18,424
Apple fall far from the tree?
Evil tree, rotten apple.

178
00:07:18,492 --> 00:07:20,794
Imagine a pretty, young,
spoiled Hollis Doyle

179
00:07:20,861 --> 00:07:23,062
on pills and coke and speed.

180
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,665
Darlin', our baby
is a drug addict,

181
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:27,466
a user who's trying
to bleed me dry,

182
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:29,568
and the only way left since
I cut her off without a cent

183
00:07:29,636 --> 00:07:31,204
after that... what was it now?
Fourth?

184
00:07:31,272 --> 00:07:33,772
No, fifth stint in rehab.

185
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,540
So you don't believe
your daughter was kidnapped?

186
00:07:35,608 --> 00:07:37,442
- No, sir, I do not.
(Debora) - How can...

187
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,278
You saw that video.
She's not lying.

188
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:40,712
She's terrified.

189
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,249
Hollis, I advise you take
a moment to fully consider.

190
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:46,518
Ain't nothing to consider,
ponder, or cogitate on.

191
00:07:46,585 --> 00:07:48,953
That child has bled me dry
her whole life.

192
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:50,587
Now she's just at it again,

193
00:07:50,655 --> 00:07:52,523
on a bigger scale
with fancier dramatics.

194
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,692
After getting kicked out
of Georgetown for cheating,

195
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,294
daddy bought her a big, fancy
penthouse next door

196
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:57,962
to keep her out of trouble...
And it worked for a while.

197
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,331
Then Maybelle met Justin
Turner at a club.

198
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:01,899
Just as rich,
just as useless.

199
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:03,834
They started dealing,
forging checks, stealing cars.

200
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,536
Think Bonnie and Clyde
on pills and coke and speed.

201
00:08:06,603 --> 00:08:08,238
Even it wasn't a hoax,
I got me eight kids

202
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:09,706
with five wives.

203
00:08:09,773 --> 00:08:12,375
If I paid up, they'd just
come take the rest.

204
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:13,743
Pretty soon I'd be stuck
working the drive-thru

205
00:08:13,811 --> 00:08:16,146
at Gettysburger
just to pay ransoms.

206
00:08:16,214 --> 00:08:18,448
This is not hypothetical.
This is happening.

207
00:08:18,515 --> 00:08:20,149
This is our daughter!

208
00:08:20,217 --> 00:08:22,417
Miss Pope, please.

209
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:25,254
Our hands are tied if we
can't go to the authorities.

210
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:27,022
We'll do our best to get
your daughter home safely,

211
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,557
but I'm gonna need you
to cooperate.

212
00:08:28,624 --> 00:08:31,493
Hollis, I need your full
participation in this.

213
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:33,128
Oh, don't get me wrong.

214
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:35,297
- I want y'all to get my Maybelle back.
- But?

215
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:38,733
But... it'll be a cold day
in hell

216
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,891
before I pay one red cent
for that gal's heinie.

217
00:08:54,854 --> 00:08:57,422
- We have a men's room.
- Same pipes. What's the difference?

218
00:08:57,489 --> 00:08:59,257
I really need to explain to you
why you spitting your plaque

219
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:01,759
and your food bits all over
my kitchen is a problem?

220
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:03,228
You need to explain to me
why the devil

221
00:09:03,296 --> 00:09:05,230
- is suddenly our client.
- He needs help.

222
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:07,331
Why not help the murderer
you rigged an election with?

223
00:09:07,398 --> 00:09:09,366
It's the Christian thing to do.

224
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:12,236
- Gladiator.
- Suit. (Breathes sharply) Yeah.

225
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:14,138
Yeah, I know.

226
00:09:14,206 --> 00:09:16,140
- What the hell does that mean?
- Watch and learn,

227
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,642
rosen, watch and learn.

- Ooh. The angle of that sunlight.

I hear the Metro.

00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,168
It only runs above ground
in a few places,

242
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:47,936
so we can narrow down
the warehouse locations

This sort of crime's
always the ex-boyfriend.

249
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:01,382
Thanks for the heads-up.

250
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:03,084
The boyfriend Justin's
been M.I.A. six months,

251
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:05,019
- ever since he left lockup.
- No sign he was here.

252
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:06,720
None of the prints
I found matched his.

253
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:08,089
He could have been
wearing gloves.

254
00:10:08,156 --> 00:10:09,623
Plus, I mean,
look at this mess.

00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:11,491
- Signs point to a struggle.
- Could be she's just messy.

Not these shoes.

I didn't know you kept up
with fashion.

259
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:20,500
I keep up with girls
who keep up with fashion.

(Sighs) Oh...

264
00:10:27,274 --> 00:10:28,908

265
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:31,343
a man you and I have
never met or heard of.

266
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:33,145
I'm looking into it,
but right now... (Sighs)

267
00:10:33,213 --> 00:10:35,180
- There's a snake in the garden, Cy.
- I don't know anything yet.

268
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:36,916
A garden that we planted
and we cultivated

269
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:39,318
- and we harvested.
- I do not know anything yet.

270
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:41,620
Do I have to take care
of this myself?

271
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:46,457
I don't know anything yet.
Yet. <i>Yet!</i>

272
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:48,026
(Sighs) (Lowered voice)
I'm simply saying

273
00:10:48,093 --> 00:10:49,961
I realize that you are not
in the best position

274
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:52,363
- with him right now.
(Lowered voice) - Yes, I am

275
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:54,265
currently on the outside looking in.
(Sighs)

276
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,368
My nose is pressed up
to the glass of life

277
00:10:57,436 --> 00:10:59,870
right now, and I want
to thank <i>you</i> for that.

278
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:01,505
I do. Because, you know,

279
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:04,141
it reminded me never
to let my guard down,

280
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,343
not when something Mellie
this way comes.

281
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:07,912
But don't you worry about me.

282
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:09,580
I will once again
be his warrior.

283
00:11:09,648 --> 00:11:13,183
I will once again sit at
the right hand of the father.

284
00:11:13,251 --> 00:11:15,017
I'm on it, my guard is up,

285
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:17,386
and as a friend of mine
likes to say, it's handled.

286
00:11:19,356 --> 00:11:22,224
He says the kids are
coming down this weekend,

287
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:24,727
which is funny, since
the Secret Service

288
00:11:24,795 --> 00:11:26,896
doesn't have any travel
for the kids on their roster.

289
00:11:26,964 --> 00:11:31,600
That feels like a thing
you should be taking care of.

290
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:41,042
Did you need something?

291
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,212
I am, um, heading to bed.

292
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,380
Good night.

293
00:11:47,282 --> 00:11:49,116
You know,
I wanted to mention...

294
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:50,685
it might be hard for Jerry
and Karen to get away

295
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,620
- from boarding school this weekend.
- It'll be fine.

296
00:11:52,688 --> 00:11:54,121
We put in the request
a month ago.

297
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:56,891
No, I know, just...
with classes.

298
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,126
Karen has a paper,
and Jerry has Lacrosse,

299
00:11:59,194 --> 00:12:00,728
and they were just here
for the holidays,

300
00:12:00,796 --> 00:12:01,963
and before that to see Teddy...

301
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,198
We are going to play tennis
all weekend.

302
00:12:05,265 --> 00:12:06,867
Well, they are.
I'll coach.

303
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,635
Can't very well play tennis
and hold the baby

304
00:12:08,703 --> 00:12:10,003
at the same time.

305
00:12:12,406 --> 00:12:14,140
Tennis. That sounds...

306
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,375
You don't have to worry
about it.

307
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:17,043
No one expects you to join us.

308
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,145
Family activities aren't
your thing, I know.

309
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:24,384
<i>(Olivia) Director Osborne.</i>
<i>To what do I owe...</i>

310
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:26,052
<i>- Who hired you?</i>
<i>- Excuse me?</i>

311
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,753
<i>You're having me followed.</i>

312
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:30,356
<i>Unless you have a crush on me,</i>
<i>I assume there's a reason.</i>

313
00:12:30,424 --> 00:12:31,757
<i>What's the reason?</i>

314
00:12:31,825 --> 00:12:33,359
<i>Director Osborne,</i>
<i>all due respect...</i>

315
00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:35,894
<i>Who hired you?!</i>
<i>(Static blips)</i>

316
00:12:35,961 --> 00:12:37,929
<i>(Rewinding)</i>

317
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:41,066
(Pressing button)

318
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:50,608
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

319
00:12:50,676 --> 00:12:51,677
What about Alexandria?

320
00:12:51,797 --> 00:12:53,244
There's some warehouses near the
King Street stop.

321
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:53,874
 Good idea.

322
00:12:53,994 --> 00:12:55,046
We'll check there
after Greenbelt.

323
00:12:55,113 --> 00:12:56,547
Or, just thinking
outside the box,

324
00:12:56,614 --> 00:12:58,248
you could save gas and time
and maybe this girl's life

325
00:12:58,315 --> 00:13:00,383
if you get the F.B.I.
to look for you.

326
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:02,986
First of all, we're so much better
than the F.B.I. at this. (Door opens)

327
00:13:03,054 --> 00:13:05,255
Secondly... here's your
fourscore, extra bacon,

328
00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:07,190
and your hushpuppies,
of course.

329
00:13:07,258 --> 00:13:08,525
And here's the rest
of the mail...

330
00:13:08,593 --> 00:13:09,693
mostly invitations
to fund raisers...

331
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:10,761
Have we ruled out Takoma Park?

332
00:13:10,828 --> 00:13:12,395
It's too residential.

333
00:13:12,463 --> 00:13:13,763
And it doesn't look like
there are any stops

334
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,598
on the Red Line that go near
a Warehouse District.

335
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,967
- This package came for you.
- My hands are awful busy, darlin'.

336
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:19,602
Well, that's all right.
Wouldn't be the first time

337
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,270
you leant your boss a hand,
right, Trixie?

338
00:13:21,337 --> 00:13:23,172
This warehouse is like
a needle in a haystack.

339
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:25,474
The police have software
that can location map

340
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:27,209
everything down to a crack
in the sidewalk.

341
00:13:27,277 --> 00:13:29,143
And that would take three days.
She'd be dead by then.

342
00:13:29,211 --> 00:13:30,845
Have we pulled up maps...
(Trixie screams)

343
00:13:30,913 --> 00:13:32,547
(Screams and gasps)

344
00:13:32,615 --> 00:13:33,848
- What's going on?
- Oh, my...

345
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,383
- I touched it!
- Is that...

346
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:36,484
(Huck) - That's an...
- I touched it!

347
00:13:39,188 --> 00:13:40,138
Ear.

348
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,972
This is Olivia Pope.

349
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,921
I'll be negotiating
on behalf of the Doyle family.

350
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,274
<i>(Maybelle on speaker)</i>
<i>Daddy, why didn't you pay him?</i>

351
00:13:53,342 --> 00:13:54,809
<i>You saw what he did to me!</i>

352
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:56,276
(Olivia) You're gonna
have to talk to me, Maybelle.

353
00:13:56,344 --> 00:13:59,661
Whoever has you, you tell them
you're only talking to me.

354
00:13:59,781 --> 00:14:01,014
<i>He cut off my ear!</i>

355
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:02,649
Afraid I'll need
to see some proof.

356
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:03,884
Proof? Are you insane?

357
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:05,852
Maybelle, we're going
to need proof.

358
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,321
<i>He's saying... (Panting)</i>

359
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,923
<i>He... he says...</i>

360
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,325
Maybelle, what does he say?

361
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,327
<i>(Sobbing) He says that you</i>
<i>need to pay up in 24 hours,</i>

362
00:14:15,395 --> 00:14:18,063
<i>or else I'm going to lose</i>
<i>something less cosmetic!</i>

363
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:19,899
<i>(Sobbing)</i>

364
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:22,167
<i>Once the money is wired</i>
<i>into his account,</i>

365
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:25,203
<i>then he'll call and he'll</i>
<i>tell you where I am.</i>

366
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:28,407
<i>(Sobbing) Please,</i>
<i>daddy, please.</i>

367
00:14:28,474 --> 00:14:32,343
<i>This time, just listen to me...</i>
(Line clicks, dial tone)

368
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:36,948
(Beep) (Gasps and sobbing)

369
00:14:37,015 --> 00:14:40,017
I'm telling y'all
that's not her ear!

370
00:14:40,085 --> 00:14:44,322
- Wh-where would Maybelle get a human ear?
- Addicts are resourceful.

371
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:46,790
Hollis, you have to consider
the risk if you're wrong.

372
00:14:46,858 --> 00:14:48,592
I tell you what.
Get me a D.N.A. test.

373
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,268
A D.N.A. test takes
48 hours minimum. We have 24.

374
00:14:52,388 --> 00:14:54,230
That's y'all's problem.
I don't pony up any money

375
00:14:54,298 --> 00:14:55,866
till I have proof
that's her ear.

376
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:58,168
You just killed our daughter.

377
00:14:58,235 --> 00:15:01,771
Are you happy?
You just killed our baby!

378
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,673
Our daughter's nothing more
than a spoiled brat

379
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,174
who wants to get her hands
on my money!

380
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:06,676
If you think I'm gonna
give it to her,

381
00:15:06,743 --> 00:15:08,811
- you're crazier than she is!
- Charming family.

382
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,880
- Okay.
- Seriously.

383
00:15:10,948 --> 00:15:12,715
Not trying to sound like
a broken record here,

384
00:15:12,783 --> 00:15:14,083
but isn't this the time
to call the police,

385
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,918
bring in the F.B.I.?

386
00:15:15,986 --> 00:15:17,486
We're dealing with a class "A" felony.
(Laughs)

387
00:15:17,553 --> 00:15:19,554
(Huck) - It's just math.
- Math?

388
00:15:19,622 --> 00:15:21,957
You hire us, we negotiate
the ransom,

389
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:23,358
make an untraceable payment,

390
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:24,860
retrieve the victim
safe and sound.

391
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,461
We've never lost a client,
not once.

392
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:28,196
You call the cops,
you get a rescue team,

393
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:29,764
dogs, body armor, the works.

394
00:15:29,832 --> 00:15:31,132
Now, you don't spend
any of your own money,

395
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,701
but the victim's chance
of survival drops to 50%

396
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:35,335
in a rescue scenario.

397
00:15:35,403 --> 00:15:37,037
So, if I wanted to see
my loved one alive,

398
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:39,239
I wouldn't call the cops,
I'd call us.

399
00:15:39,307 --> 00:15:41,642
Every time. (Hollis and
Debora arguing indistinctly)

400
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,311
Hey, Liv.
Let me ask you a question.

401
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:45,746
Why are we helping Doyle?

402
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:48,215
Why is the devil our client?

403
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:52,852
Because even the devil
loves his kids.

404
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,073
Ma'am.
(Sighs)

405
00:15:58,141 --> 00:15:59,941
How can I help you today?

406
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:02,278
I'm going to need you to change
Fitz's schedule this weekend.

407
00:16:02,345 --> 00:16:03,779
Oh, no need to worry,
Mrs. grant.

408
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:05,080
I have already completely
cleared it

409
00:16:05,148 --> 00:16:06,781
so he can spend time
with the children.

410
00:16:06,848 --> 00:16:07,915
That's lovely.
And thoughtful.

411
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:09,684
But now I need you
to unclear it.

412
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:11,152
- Ma'am?
- He's a busy man.

413
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:12,620
He runs the greatest
nation on earth.

414
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:14,188
Surely he has things
he could be doing.

415
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:16,391
Well, he always has things
he <i>could</i> be doing...

416
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,625
Put them on his schedule
this weekend.

417
00:16:17,693 --> 00:16:20,227
Yes, ma'am.

418
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:22,128
(Lowered voice) Are you
keeping bad news from him

419
00:16:22,196 --> 00:16:23,930
in an effort to stay
on his good side?

420
00:16:23,998 --> 00:16:25,399
(Lowered voice)
I would think you have

421
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:27,133
enough problems of your own
to worry about

422
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:29,969
without meddling
in our private family affairs.

423
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:34,541
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

424
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:37,443
(Phone chimes)

425
00:16:37,511 --> 00:16:40,014
(Clicks and beeps)
Cyrus, I can't talk.

426
00:16:40,134 --> 00:16:40,764
Why not?

427
00:16:40,884 --> 00:16:43,514
Because Hollis Doyle's
daughter's been kidnapped.

428
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:46,552
Karma.

429
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,721
You are a bad man.

430
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:50,255
Just take a moment to feel
the karma.

431
00:16:50,324 --> 00:16:51,424
Good-bye, Cyrus.

432
00:16:51,491 --> 00:16:53,391
(Clicks and beeps)

433
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,461
(Chimes) (Sighing)

434
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:58,062
Jake, how are you?

435
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,531
I was just wondering
what you were up to.

436
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:00,799
I thought maybe we could
grab some lunch.

437
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:03,301
I'd love to, but I can't.
I'm in the middle

438
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:05,537
of something at work.
Maybe later, when I'm home?

439
00:17:05,604 --> 00:17:07,905
Yeah, maybe later,
when you're home. (Beeps)

440
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:13,244
(Clicks)

441
00:17:13,312 --> 00:17:15,779
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking) (Clatters)

442
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:17,748
(Camera shutter clicking)

443
00:17:17,816 --> 00:17:19,550
(Clicks)

444
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:21,719
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

445
00:17:23,822 --> 00:17:25,589
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

446
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:31,061
(Opens drawer)

447
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:34,564
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

448
00:17:41,138 --> 00:17:43,906
(Beeps)

449
00:17:43,974 --> 00:17:46,008
These documents came from
a flash drive that,

450
00:17:46,076 --> 00:17:49,411
until very recently, I believe
was in Osborne's possession.

451
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:51,546
The level of security clearance
required to access

452
00:17:51,614 --> 00:17:54,216
this information belongs
to a handful of people...

453
00:17:54,284 --> 00:17:57,052
You, Secretary of Defense,
the Vice President,

454
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,253
and Osborne.

455
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,687
Why do you assume it's Osborne?

456
00:17:59,755 --> 00:18:03,124
Because I saw him
threatening my source.

457
00:18:03,192 --> 00:18:05,059
You're not gonna tell me
who the source is, are you?

458
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,427
No, sir, I'm not.

459
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:08,930
I know this is a big gamble.

460
00:18:08,998 --> 00:18:11,599
But consider the damage
a guy like Osborne can do,

461
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,334
especially if we drag
our feet on this.

462
00:18:13,402 --> 00:18:15,402
You trust this source?

463
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,803
They brought home
the hostages, didn't they?

464
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:20,307
You asked me to do a job.

465
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,641
I did it.

466
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:24,477
And I am telling you,
Grayden Osborne is your mole.

467
00:18:26,614 --> 00:18:28,681
(Train whirring)

468
00:18:28,749 --> 00:18:29,907
So?

469
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:32,118
- Not the kidnapper's building.
- And why?

470
00:18:32,185 --> 00:18:33,886
It doesn't match the video.
The windows don't open.

471
00:18:33,954 --> 00:18:35,888
Very good.

472
00:18:35,956 --> 00:18:38,124
(Door opens) Hey...

473
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:39,892
How about them?

474
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,294
They live in an apartment.

475
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:42,861
So? Nice families
live in apartments.

476
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,630
Ah, no yard, no dog.

477
00:18:44,697 --> 00:18:46,898
They got a little dog.
It doesn't need a yard.

478
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:48,300
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

479
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:50,302
(Scoffs) That is not a dog.

480
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:51,736
You're never gonna find
the perfect family.

481
00:18:51,804 --> 00:18:54,672
Perfect families don't exist.

482
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,309
(Musical ringtone)
Hey, new message!

483
00:18:57,376 --> 00:18:59,177
And there's an attachment.
Pull it up on the TV.

484
00:18:59,245 --> 00:19:01,179
(Typing)

485
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,679
(Gasps) Oh, God!

486
00:19:02,747 --> 00:19:05,316
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

487
00:19:05,383 --> 00:19:06,616
(Debora gasps)

488
00:19:06,684 --> 00:19:08,986
Well, it was definitely
her ear.

489
00:19:09,054 --> 00:19:11,021
(Panting)

490
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:13,557
(Huck) Plaid curtains,
Western sunlight,

491
00:19:13,624 --> 00:19:15,459
electrical transformer
across the street.

492
00:19:15,526 --> 00:19:17,461
Just like in the video.
So where's Maybelle?

493
00:19:17,528 --> 00:19:19,728
I don't know, but she was
definitely here.

494
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:22,932
Pay 'em.

495
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,850
Pay 'em. Pay 'em
whatever they want.

496
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,833
- It doesn't work like that, Hollis.
- You hear me?

497
00:19:26,953 --> 00:19:30,039
Pay them son of a bitches,
get my baby back here now!

498
00:19:36,118 --> 00:19:37,419
We're all set up to wire
the money

499
00:19:37,487 --> 00:19:39,598
via electronic transfer
to the account number.

500
00:19:39,898 --> 00:19:41,382
However...
(Turns off TV)

501
00:19:41,502 --> 00:19:43,759
- We're only sending half of it.
- What?

502
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:45,192
If we give him
everything he's asking for,

503
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,660
you'll never see Maybelle
again.

504
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,796
He's already proven
he means business with the ear,

505
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,530
and it's a cleaner getaway
if there aren't any witnesses

506
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:52,899
- to testify against him.
- So what do we do?

507
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:54,901
To get her back?
What do we do?

508
00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:57,203
Pay half up front,
then wire the rest of it

509
00:19:57,271 --> 00:19:59,839
only when we see she's alive
and we can assure her safety.

510
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,541
I say we wire the whole
enchilada, get this over with!

511
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:04,110
With all due respect,
I'm not looking for your advice

512
00:20:04,178 --> 00:20:05,511
on how to handle this.

513
00:20:05,578 --> 00:20:07,545
I'm telling you
what my associates and I

514
00:20:07,613 --> 00:20:09,047
think the best way forward is.

515
00:20:09,115 --> 00:20:11,382
Is it risky? Yes.

516
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:13,782
Welcome to kidnapping.

517
00:20:15,754 --> 00:20:17,856
Do it.

518
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:24,962
(Typing continues)

519
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,230
It's done.

520
00:20:26,298 --> 00:20:28,866
$10 million.

521
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:30,301
(Voice breaking)
What if he doesn't call?

522
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:32,236
He will.

523
00:20:32,304 --> 00:20:34,138
Just wait.

524
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:40,743
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

525
00:20:40,811 --> 00:20:44,647
Is he dirty? Dirty? I don't know.
But I think I figured out

526
00:20:44,715 --> 00:20:46,916
how he and the president
know each other.

527
00:20:59,795 --> 00:21:01,496
What happened in Iran?

528
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:02,664
What are you talking about?

529
00:21:02,732 --> 00:21:04,098
Operation Remington.

530
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,767
It was '91,
the end of the Gulf war.

531
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:08,002
Your plane went down
over Iranian airspace...

532
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,572
Mountains west of Nurabad.
You were rescued.

533
00:21:10,606 --> 00:21:11,672
You've been looking into me?

534
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:13,106
Mission report is redacted,

535
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:14,875
even for my lofty level
of access.

536
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,910
What, are you looking for dirt
on me so you can keep your job?

537
00:21:16,978 --> 00:21:18,712
Maybe it was a simple
extraction.

538
00:21:18,747 --> 00:21:20,947
A handful of special forces
and a couple of black hawks,

539
00:21:21,015 --> 00:21:22,182
and you were tucked
into your bunk

540
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,717
just a few hours later.

541
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:26,420
Or maybe... you got caught
in a village

542
00:21:26,488 --> 00:21:28,120
and had to fight your way out.

543
00:21:28,188 --> 00:21:29,589
Maybe it was My Lai, Iranian style.
(Sighs)

544
00:21:29,657 --> 00:21:31,391
Maybe things got ugly.

545
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,459
- You want to stop playing games?
- I'm not playing any games.

546
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:35,060
You want to know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

547
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,296
I don't care what happened.
I don't need to know.

548
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:39,499
Point is, you did things.

549
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:41,000
(Breathing heavily)

550
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:42,468
Things you can't talk about.

551
00:21:42,536 --> 00:21:44,803
Heroic things you can't
put in your memoirs

552
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,506
because it would endanger
our military operations,

553
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:51,276
things that might even endanger
the foundation of the Republic.

554
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:53,044
Who knows?
Well, guess what.

555
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:54,879
(Breathes sharply)

556
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,381
So did I.

557
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,983
And just because
my battleground was in Ohio

558
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,718
and not the Persian Gulf
doesn't make me

559
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,953
any less of a patriot

560
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:06,123
or make my <i>service</i>
any less valiant.

561
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,526
And just like you, I can't
talk about that service,

562
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,227
that operation,
because doing so

563
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:13,263
would endanger the Republic
for which we stand.

564
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,399
But still,
I can be proud of it.

565
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,335
I am proud of it,
just as I hope you

566
00:22:18,402 --> 00:22:20,103
are proud
of Operation Remington.

567
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:21,839
You are equating
what you did in Defiance

568
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:23,874
with national security issues?

569
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,775
I'm saying the right side
and the wrong side...

570
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,644
(Breathing heavily)
Are determined not by me

571
00:22:27,712 --> 00:22:30,647
and not by you...

572
00:22:30,715 --> 00:22:32,315
but by history.

573
00:22:32,382 --> 00:22:35,517
History makes the heroes
and the villains, sir.

574
00:22:35,585 --> 00:22:38,520
You and I, we're just players.

575
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:46,295
(Exhales)

576
00:22:50,566 --> 00:22:51,699
Sit down.

577
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:53,468
Sir?

578
00:22:53,535 --> 00:22:55,503
Have a seat, Cy.

579
00:22:58,107 --> 00:23:00,308
(Exhales)

580
00:23:00,376 --> 00:23:01,943
I've ordered the F.B.I.

581
00:23:02,011 --> 00:23:03,711
To raid Grayden Osborne's
office and home

582
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:06,046
to seize any and all
communications.

583
00:23:06,114 --> 00:23:07,547
Why?

584
00:23:07,615 --> 00:23:09,383
Osborne's our mole, Cy.

585
00:23:11,286 --> 00:23:14,288
I received some documentation

586
00:23:14,356 --> 00:23:17,057
with some highly classified
intelligence

587
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,393
that only he and the Secretary
of Defense would have.

588
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,195
(Typing)

589
00:23:22,263 --> 00:23:24,297
- No call?
- No call.

590
00:23:24,365 --> 00:23:26,366
(Sighs)

591
00:23:29,704 --> 00:23:33,607
(Sniffling)

592
00:23:38,412 --> 00:23:40,379
(Door closes, bottles clink)

593
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:44,216
Drink?

594
00:23:44,284 --> 00:23:48,120
For the life of me,
I can't remember...

595
00:23:48,187 --> 00:23:50,088
when it happened.

596
00:23:50,156 --> 00:23:52,424
Even how.

597
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:54,292
One day she's the love
of my life,

598
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:57,595
my little sidekick,
my partner in crime.

599
00:23:57,663 --> 00:24:00,998
Just like that...

600
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,767
she's my enemy.

601
00:24:04,603 --> 00:24:06,638
Can only assume
the worst of her.

602
00:24:06,705 --> 00:24:08,272
(Breathing unevenly)

603
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,040
I let her down.

604
00:24:14,446 --> 00:24:16,012
(Voice breaking)
I let my baby down.

605
00:24:21,553 --> 00:24:24,220
(Musical ringtone)

606
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:31,260
(Beeps) Maybelle, it's Olivia.

607
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:32,795
<i>(Maybelle on speaker) He says</i>
<i>he doesn't have all the money!</i>

608
00:24:32,863 --> 00:24:34,163
<i>Where's the rest of the money?!</i>

609
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,331
Maybelle, tell him he'll get
the rest

610
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:36,799
upon confirmation of life.

611
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:38,485
That's non-negotiable.

612
00:24:42,538 --> 00:24:45,306
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>He says that's okay.</i>

613
00:24:45,374 --> 00:24:47,909
<i>But no surprises, or...</i>
<i>(Sobbing)</i>

614
00:24:47,977 --> 00:24:50,211
<i>Oh, God, please don't hurt me! Please!
Aah!</i> Don't you touch her!

615
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,880
Proof of life, and we wire you

616
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,782
the second $10 million
on sight.

617
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,951
- I'll give you the location where...
<i>- No!</i>

618
00:24:56,018 --> 00:24:58,352
<i>He says he chooses
where we go.</i>

619
00:24:58,419 --> 00:24:59,987
Okay.

620
00:25:00,054 --> 00:25:02,022
Give me the address.

621
00:25:05,494 --> 00:25:07,995
(Exhales)

622
00:25:08,062 --> 00:25:12,132
Maybelle, I need an address.

623
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,934
<i>There's an old gas station</i>
<i>on Route 50</i>

624
00:25:15,002 --> 00:25:17,103
<i>between Aurora Pike</i>
<i>and Stemple Ridge Road.</i>

625
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:21,774
<i>(Pants) He says...</i>

626
00:25:21,842 --> 00:25:24,143
<i>He says you have 20 minutes.</i>

627
00:25:28,915 --> 00:25:30,549
This is it.

628
00:25:33,285 --> 00:25:36,788
(Olivia) Here we are!
No authorities!

629
00:25:36,856 --> 00:25:39,324
As promised!

630
00:25:39,815 --> 00:25:41,832
Now it's your turn!

631
00:25:42,862 --> 00:25:44,829
(Rattling)

632
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:50,902
Send it.
So she's there?

633
00:25:50,969 --> 00:25:52,003
(Taps key) She's still alive?

634
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,005
Yeah. It's done.

635
00:25:54,072 --> 00:25:55,472
You have the money!
Now let her go!

636
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:57,207
- He could have a gun on her.
- He could have a gun on us.

637
00:25:57,275 --> 00:25:59,076
Maybelle, it's okay.

638
00:25:59,144 --> 00:26:01,745
Walk towards me.
No one's gonna hurt you.

639
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:04,014
He has his money.
You're free now.

640
00:26:04,081 --> 00:26:05,715
Walk towards me.
Let me go in.

641
00:26:05,783 --> 00:26:07,283
Easy, Huck. Come on.

642
00:26:07,351 --> 00:26:09,318
It's okay. You're free.
I can get this guy.

643
00:26:09,386 --> 00:26:10,486
Not our job.
Let me take...

644
00:26:10,555 --> 00:26:13,222
Huck, no! Come here, Maybelle.

645
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,858
(Tires screech)

646
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:23,679
If you want to, we can
still call the police.

647
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,433
No, no.

648
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:26,933
I'm just glad to have
my baby back.

649
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:28,368
(Monitor beeping)

650
00:26:28,436 --> 00:26:31,069
I can't believe
Justin did this to me.

651
00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:33,283
I can't believe he took
your money.

652
00:26:33,403 --> 00:26:35,619
You're home safe now.
That's all that matters.

653
00:26:39,938 --> 00:26:41,455
(Softly) Thank you.

654
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:45,284
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

655
00:26:45,351 --> 00:26:48,053
(Sighs)

656
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:51,857
(Phone chimes)

657
00:26:51,925 --> 00:26:53,759
(Beeps)

658
00:26:53,827 --> 00:26:57,312
- Cyrus.
- I'll be there in 20. I was thinking

659
00:26:57,432 --> 00:26:58,228
a nice Napa red with a side

660
00:26:58,348 --> 00:26:59,631
              of stovetop popcorn.

661
00:26:59,698 --> 00:27:02,014
- We'll go old school tonight?
- I can't.

662
00:27:02,134 --> 00:27:04,401
I'm... I have plans.

663
00:27:04,469 --> 00:27:06,003
Is it a date? Who is he?

664
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:09,173
You wouldn't know him.
I don't even know if I know him.

665
00:27:09,241 --> 00:27:12,536
There's something...
not quite right there,

666
00:27:12,656 --> 00:27:14,178
but I'm going with it,

667
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:15,712
because God knows,
when it comes to men,

668
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:17,380
my instincts haven't exactly
served me well.

669
00:27:17,448 --> 00:27:19,739
So I'm jumping.

670
00:27:20,451 --> 00:27:21,952
This is me jumping.

671
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:24,254
Why is everybody cheating on me?

672
00:27:24,322 --> 00:27:25,606
You don't mean...

673
00:27:25,726 --> 00:27:27,903
Not James, of course not.
My other marriage.

674
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:29,625
(Sighs)
But I think I'm back in.

675
00:27:29,693 --> 00:27:31,460
Now I just have to get rid
of the competition.

676
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:32,895
Fitz is getting advice
from someone else?

677
00:27:32,963 --> 00:27:34,029
- Yep.
- Who?

678
00:27:34,097 --> 00:27:35,331
You don't know him.

679
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:37,399
Go for the jugular.

680
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:38,500
I always do.

681
00:27:40,403 --> 00:27:42,338
How is he?

682
00:27:44,507 --> 00:27:46,141
You have a date

683
00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:48,973
with a new guy, remember?

684
00:27:49,093 --> 00:27:50,945
(Exhales) Good-bye,
Cyrus.

685
00:27:51,013 --> 00:27:52,180
Good-bye, Liv.

686
00:27:52,248 --> 00:27:54,548
(Sighs)
(Phone beeps)

687
00:27:54,616 --> 00:27:56,918
(Exhales)

688
00:27:56,986 --> 00:27:58,920
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

689
00:28:00,923 --> 00:28:03,523
Well, you look incredible.
A little underdressed

690
00:28:03,591 --> 00:28:05,158
for a 5-star
dining experience, but...

691
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:06,760
- I tried to call you.
- I know.

692
00:28:06,827 --> 00:28:08,262
I ignored the call.

693
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,664
I don't think
I'm going to go.

694
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,200
Two steps forward,
one step back.

695
00:28:13,268 --> 00:28:15,335
I have a lot of work to do,
and I'm really tired,

696
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:17,337
- and I just...
- You are afraid.

697
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:21,613
Of me. Of the unknown.
Of what this is.

698
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,879
You seem like a really
great guy,

699
00:28:25,946 --> 00:28:27,547
and maybe I'm just...

700
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,286
I had a relationship
with a man I thought was...

701
00:28:33,353 --> 00:28:35,154
(Breathes sharply)
and I'm not over it yet.

702
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:37,255
I don't know how to judge
anymore what's good,

703
00:28:37,323 --> 00:28:39,357
what's bad, if I...

704
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,593
someone mentioned him to me
on the phone five minutes ago,

705
00:28:41,661 --> 00:28:43,629
and I...

706
00:28:43,696 --> 00:28:45,831
I think about him.
I worry about him.

707
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:49,234
I wouldn't be on a date
with you. I...

708
00:28:49,302 --> 00:28:52,202
H-he's in my head
all the time. (Chuckles)

709
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,104
Close your eyes.
Wh-what?

710
00:28:54,172 --> 00:28:55,773
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

711
00:28:55,841 --> 00:28:57,675
You don't know me.

712
00:28:57,743 --> 00:28:59,744
I might be the worst guy
in the world.

713
00:28:59,812 --> 00:29:02,647
Or I might be the best.

714
00:29:02,714 --> 00:29:06,354
Whoever I am, I like you.
I like you a lot.

715
00:29:07,152 --> 00:29:08,552
I like how you say "What?"

716
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:10,320
When you answer the phone.

717
00:29:10,387 --> 00:29:12,589
How you always seem to be
wearing white.

718
00:29:12,657 --> 00:29:16,192
How wine seems to be
a food group for you.

719
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,328
I like that you know
who you are,

720
00:29:18,395 --> 00:29:21,498
and that you fix
everyone around you.

721
00:29:21,566 --> 00:29:25,334
But you seem...
sad to me, Olivia.

722
00:29:25,401 --> 00:29:28,671
I like you,
but you seem sad.

723
00:29:28,738 --> 00:29:30,506
And if you let me,

724
00:29:30,574 --> 00:29:32,875
maybe I can help you
not be so sad.

725
00:29:32,943 --> 00:29:34,209
Because whatever
happened to you...

726
00:29:34,277 --> 00:29:36,612
<i>Whoever</i> happened to you...

727
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,514
already happened, it's done.

728
00:29:38,582 --> 00:29:39,914
So maybe I can help you
start fresh.

729
00:29:39,982 --> 00:29:41,716
Maybe...

730
00:29:41,784 --> 00:29:43,050
I'm your do-over.

731
00:29:43,118 --> 00:29:44,686
(Stifled chuckle)

732
00:29:44,753 --> 00:29:46,821
'Cause you deserve
a do-over.

733
00:29:46,889 --> 00:29:49,123
So close your eyes.

734
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,353
Close... your... eyes.

735
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,968
(Exhales)

736
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:23,890
Are you still thinking
about him?

737
00:30:23,957 --> 00:30:25,722
(Softly) No.

738
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:30,828
Good night, Olivia.

739
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:35,733
Good night, Jake.

740
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:39,003
(Door opens)

741
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,139
(Door closes)

742
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:44,874
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

743
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:47,277
(Rustling)

744
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,115
Really? We eat in here.

745
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,118
Huck, throw it away!

746
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,253
- Shh! He's working on something.
- Come here.

747
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,056
(Abby scoffs)

748
00:31:02,892 --> 00:31:04,360
Really?!

749
00:31:04,428 --> 00:31:05,728
Huck, what are you working on?

750
00:31:05,795 --> 00:31:07,597
Finally got a call back
from my source at Justice.

751
00:31:07,664 --> 00:31:09,165
Turns out Maybelle's
ex-boyfriend's been sitting

752
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:10,766
in a Thai prison
for the last two months.

753
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:12,735
Customs caught him trying to poop out
a shampoo bottle full of heroin.

754
00:31:12,802 --> 00:31:14,604
 No one knew he
was there until now?

755
00:31:14,671 --> 00:31:16,304
- Rich parents kept it hush-hush.
- So he's not the kidnapper?

756
00:31:16,372 --> 00:31:17,705
No, she is.

757
00:31:23,078 --> 00:31:24,812
The frayed edge...

758
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,648
If a kidnapper
had cut off the ear,

759
00:31:26,715 --> 00:31:28,383
he would have pressed on
Maybelle's scalp for leverage.

760
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:29,618
It would have been a clean cut.

761
00:31:29,685 --> 00:31:30,985
But this isn't clean

762
00:31:31,053 --> 00:31:32,620
because she couldn't get
the necessary leverage.

763
00:31:32,687 --> 00:31:34,488
She had to saw through it.

764
00:31:34,556 --> 00:31:36,390
She did this to herself.

765
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,992
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

766
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,528
Maybelle kidnapped herself.

767
00:31:56,298 --> 00:31:57,632
Dulles airport.

768
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,834
(Beeps)

769
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:04,371
We reversed the deposits
to your father's account

770
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:06,006
and called the police.

771
00:32:06,074 --> 00:32:07,808
Of course you did.

772
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:09,143
(Scoffs)

773
00:32:09,211 --> 00:32:10,911
You always find a way
to screw me.

774
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:13,280
How can...

775
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,991
Do you realize
how worried we were?

776
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:18,885
How sick we were
when we thought s...

777
00:32:20,591 --> 00:32:22,407
How do you do
that to yourself?

778
00:32:22,527 --> 00:32:24,924
How do you cut yourself?
How do you hurt yourself?

779
00:32:24,992 --> 00:32:26,593
I needed the money.

780
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,528
How could you do this to us?

781
00:32:28,596 --> 00:32:30,396
We love you...

782
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,432
What do you want, mom?

783
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,101
I want you to come home.

784
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:38,703
I want to make it right.

785
00:32:38,771 --> 00:32:41,573
Whatever we did to make you...

786
00:32:41,641 --> 00:32:44,042
Hate us like this...
(Breathes sharply) I...

787
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,810
I... I want to
make it right.

788
00:32:45,878 --> 00:32:50,749
You can't. It's too late.

789
00:32:50,816 --> 00:32:53,317
Poor little rich girl.

790
00:32:53,385 --> 00:32:55,153
Excuse me?

791
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,621
What was it?

792
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:59,289
He worked late,
she missed your dance recitals,

793
00:32:59,357 --> 00:33:01,291
they threw you
in reform school, rehab,

794
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:03,460
they tried to buy your love
instead of earning it?

795
00:33:03,528 --> 00:33:05,395
Whatever they told you
in therapy,

796
00:33:05,463 --> 00:33:07,497
whatever sad cliche you're
still holding on to

797
00:33:07,565 --> 00:33:09,432
after all these years,
it doesn't matter.

798
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,269
No one feels sorry for you,
not anymore.

799
00:33:12,336 --> 00:33:15,137
You're being offered
a fresh start,

800
00:33:15,205 --> 00:33:17,839
a clean slate, a do-over.

801
00:33:17,907 --> 00:33:20,609
That doesn't happen.
No one gets that. Ever.

802
00:33:20,677 --> 00:33:21,910
And if you don't take it,

803
00:33:21,978 --> 00:33:24,413
you're not just spoiled
and selfish,

804
00:33:24,481 --> 00:33:26,748
you're stupid.

805
00:33:27,551 --> 00:33:30,485
You need to make
a choice, May.

806
00:33:30,553 --> 00:33:33,488
Because your mom and I...

807
00:33:33,556 --> 00:33:35,423
she can't go through this
again.

808
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:37,392
So you need to make a choice.

809
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,527
You want the money...

810
00:33:41,903 --> 00:33:43,620
Or you want your family?

811
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:47,768
You're offering me $20 million?

812
00:33:47,836 --> 00:33:49,436
You take the money,

813
00:33:49,504 --> 00:33:52,406
you don't come back.

814
00:33:52,474 --> 00:33:54,909
What's it gonna be?

815
00:33:54,977 --> 00:33:59,085
Money... or family?

816
00:34:04,284 --> 00:34:06,252
I...

817
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,890
Money... or family?

818
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:13,760
Money.

819
00:34:15,462 --> 00:34:18,097
I'll wire it to you tomorrow.

820
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,435
Go on.

821
00:34:27,641 --> 00:34:28,540
Get!

822
00:34:33,912 --> 00:34:36,213
(Sobbing)

823
00:34:36,281 --> 00:34:37,615
(Door closes)

824
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,958
(Sobbing continues)

825
00:34:47,026 --> 00:34:48,526
(Door closes)

826
00:34:51,595 --> 00:34:54,297
Hey, dad, it's me.

827
00:34:54,365 --> 00:34:57,300
Lindsay. Again. Uh...

828
00:34:57,368 --> 00:34:58,935
I'm not sure if you've
checked your messages.

829
00:34:59,003 --> 00:35:01,972
I've left you about ten.
I just...

830
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,540
I wanted to say
"Happy Birthday" to you

831
00:35:03,607 --> 00:35:05,408
instead of to a machine.

832
00:35:05,476 --> 00:35:07,376
But you're not picking up.

833
00:35:07,443 --> 00:35:11,914
Okay, well,
Happy Birthday... again.

834
00:35:11,982 --> 00:35:13,649
(Beeps)

835
00:35:13,717 --> 00:35:15,818
(Sighs)

836
00:35:18,421 --> 00:35:20,122
Tell me this isn't happening!

837
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,990
(Door slams) Tell me
those men in my office,

838
00:35:22,058 --> 00:35:24,726
those men in my <i>house...</i>

839
00:35:24,794 --> 00:35:26,961
The ones putting my entire
life into boxes and bags...

840
00:35:27,029 --> 00:35:29,864
It's happening.

841
00:35:29,932 --> 00:35:32,133
I am not the mole, Cy.

842
00:35:32,201 --> 00:35:34,602
I did not leak those documents.

843
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,538
No?

844
00:35:37,606 --> 00:35:40,040
(Softly) No.

845
00:35:40,108 --> 00:35:42,943
(Normal voice) I have spent
my entire adult life

846
00:35:43,011 --> 00:35:45,045
serving this country.

847
00:35:45,113 --> 00:35:46,947
I never went to any
of my son's soccer games.

848
00:35:47,015 --> 00:35:48,648
I missed my daughter's
high school graduation.

849
00:35:48,717 --> 00:35:50,450
I haven't been out to dinner
with my wife in years.

850
00:35:50,518 --> 00:35:53,920
Why? Because I have always
chosen <i>the Agency</i>

851
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:56,422
above anything else.

852
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:59,759
Not because it was my job.

853
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:01,127
Because it was my duty.

854
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,931
I am not your mole.

855
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:06,699
I am not a traitor!

856
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:10,668
Tell me that you do not
actually believe

857
00:36:10,737 --> 00:36:12,437
that I betrayed my country.

858
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:21,146
The president has decided

859
00:36:21,214 --> 00:36:24,916
he no longer needs
your services.

860
00:36:24,984 --> 00:36:27,417
And I serve at the pleasure
of the president.

861
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,128
(Sighs)

862
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:40,765
(Sighs)

863
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,101
You wanted to see me?

864
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:46,602
Lauren tells me you asked her

865
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,138
to change my schedule
this weekend.

866
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:49,839
You had several important
meetings she was going to cancel

867
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:51,841
because of the children's visit,
and I thought it was simply best

868
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:53,309
to cancel the children's
visit and...

869
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,245
<i>What</i> is wrong with you?

870
00:36:55,312 --> 00:36:57,413
Fitz, I was just
trying to be helpful.

871
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,481
They're our kids!

872
00:36:59,548 --> 00:37:00,983
You shipped them off
to boarding school

873
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,785
the minute they were
old enough to go,

874
00:37:02,852 --> 00:37:04,286
and now, on one of their
few free weekends,

875
00:37:04,353 --> 00:37:05,821
one of <i>my</i> few free weekends,
you cancel on them?

876
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:09,224
These are our children!

877
00:37:09,292 --> 00:37:10,759
I get it.

878
00:37:10,827 --> 00:37:12,460
You don't have the mother gene.

879
00:37:12,528 --> 00:37:14,295
You don't want to be
bothered to raise them

880
00:37:14,362 --> 00:37:17,564
or take care of them, but I'd
think you'd at least love them.

881
00:37:17,632 --> 00:37:19,100
I love them.

882
00:37:19,168 --> 00:37:20,734
You're cold.
I'm not cold!

883
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:22,703
Or maybe you just did it
to hurt me, I don't know.

884
00:37:22,771 --> 00:37:24,172
(Clatters)

885
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:26,707
I've been looking forward
to this visit, and you just

886
00:37:26,775 --> 00:37:28,442
cancel it without even
asking me?

887
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,010
Are you punishing me?
(Sets bottle down)

888
00:37:30,077 --> 00:37:32,112
I'm not... what about them?
Did you even think about

889
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,680
how this must make
Jerry and Karen feel,

890
00:37:33,747 --> 00:37:35,515
how rejected they must feel
by their own mother

891
00:37:35,582 --> 00:37:37,284
who cancels their visit
at the last minute?

892
00:37:37,351 --> 00:37:39,186
They didn't want to come!

893
00:37:39,253 --> 00:37:40,687
What?

894
00:37:40,754 --> 00:37:43,824
(Sighs)

895
00:37:43,891 --> 00:37:46,826
They didn't want to come, Fitz.

896
00:37:46,893 --> 00:37:48,493
They have called me
every single day

897
00:37:48,561 --> 00:37:50,329
since you summoned them to
the White House for this visit

898
00:37:50,396 --> 00:37:51,964
begging me to cancel this trip.

899
00:37:52,032 --> 00:37:54,033
Oh, please. If you think
I'm gonna buy that...

900
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,569
You are different.
You are <i>different.</i>

901
00:37:57,637 --> 00:37:59,905
Ever since... (Sighs)

902
00:38:01,808 --> 00:38:03,875
You're different.
And they are not babies.

903
00:38:03,943 --> 00:38:05,643
They are not Teddy.
They are teenagers,

904
00:38:05,711 --> 00:38:07,745
and they know their father's
not their father...

905
00:38:07,813 --> 00:38:09,147
I <i>am</i> their father!

906
00:38:09,215 --> 00:38:10,849
You stink like scotch.

907
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:13,718
They can smell it
on your skin all of the time.

908
00:38:13,785 --> 00:38:16,154
You are lubricated
all of the time now,

909
00:38:16,222 --> 00:38:18,088
which makes you mean.

910
00:38:18,156 --> 00:38:21,024
You're mean, Fitz!

911
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:22,726
Karen hates tennis,

912
00:38:22,793 --> 00:38:24,561
and you know that!

913
00:38:24,628 --> 00:38:26,596
You used to make it fun
and funny for her.

914
00:38:26,664 --> 00:38:28,332
The last time they were here,
you yelled at her

915
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:30,067
the entire time she played.

916
00:38:30,134 --> 00:38:31,869
And when you weren't
forcing her to play tennis,

917
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,837
you were firing
political questions at her.

918
00:38:33,904 --> 00:38:36,572
And Jerry...

919
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:39,876
He is shy and he is gentle,
and you know that,

920
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:42,511
and now... (Sighs)

921
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:45,014
He's afraid of you.

922
00:38:45,082 --> 00:38:47,183
It's you.

923
00:38:47,251 --> 00:38:49,018
You're different.

924
00:38:49,086 --> 00:38:51,186
And maybe I'm cold,

925
00:38:51,254 --> 00:38:53,221
and maybe I don't have
the mother gene,

926
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,290
and maybe a thousand other
things that make me

927
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:56,892
such a horrible villainous
bitch in your book,

928
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,694
but in Jerry and Karen's book,

929
00:38:59,762 --> 00:39:02,297
I'm still their mom.

930
00:39:02,365 --> 00:39:04,266
I haven't changed.
It's you.

931
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,867
You're not their father
anymore.

932
00:39:06,935 --> 00:39:08,435
And it's not because
you found out about Defiance.

933
00:39:08,503 --> 00:39:12,239
That's the thing
that is so... (Sighs)

934
00:39:12,307 --> 00:39:14,708
It's because you found
your precious Olivia

935
00:39:14,776 --> 00:39:16,243
doesn't have the secrets
of the universe

936
00:39:16,311 --> 00:39:17,945
tucked between
her magical thighs,

937
00:39:18,013 --> 00:39:20,747
that she is just a person
like everybody else,

938
00:39:20,815 --> 00:39:23,016
and that she is capable
of using you

939
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:24,717
just like everybody else.

940
00:39:24,785 --> 00:39:27,053
And suddenly you're devastated

941
00:39:27,121 --> 00:39:31,791
and you stop being
their father.

942
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:33,559
You're not their father
anymore.

943
00:39:33,627 --> 00:39:35,094
And you are not Fitz anymore.

944
00:39:35,162 --> 00:39:37,663
You know who you are?
You know who you've become?

945
00:39:37,731 --> 00:39:41,734
You're big Jerry.

946
00:39:41,802 --> 00:39:43,569
You're <i>your</i> father.

947
00:39:45,505 --> 00:39:47,139
Everybody
in this White House...

948
00:39:47,206 --> 00:39:49,575
Cyrus and me included...
tiptoe around,

949
00:39:49,643 --> 00:39:51,644
trying to figure out
how to get on your good side,

950
00:39:51,711 --> 00:39:53,512
but you don't have a good side!

951
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,113
You've turned into your father!

952
00:39:56,181 --> 00:39:59,617
So... you should understand

953
00:39:59,685 --> 00:40:03,220
how your children feel,

954
00:40:03,288 --> 00:40:07,124
considering how much
you hated your dad.

955
00:40:08,527 --> 00:40:10,161
They didn't want to come.

956
00:40:10,228 --> 00:40:13,029
And so I told them
they didn't have to.

957
00:40:13,097 --> 00:40:15,365
Deal with it.

958
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:16,800
(Scoffs)

959
00:40:16,868 --> 00:40:20,370
Put another glass of scotch
on top of it and just...

960
00:40:20,438 --> 00:40:22,405
deal with it.

961
00:40:26,543 --> 00:40:28,845
(Door opens)

962
00:40:28,912 --> 00:40:30,480
(Door closes)

963
00:40:40,557 --> 00:40:44,192
(Turns off engine)
This is it.

964
00:40:44,259 --> 00:40:46,361
This is it?
Where's the mom?

965
00:40:46,428 --> 00:40:49,330
Dad's name is Dave.
Daughter's Emily.

966
00:40:49,398 --> 00:40:51,633
Mother died a few years ago.

967
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:53,201
Cancer.

968
00:40:53,268 --> 00:40:56,170
Uh, since then, Dave's
been running half-marathons.

969
00:40:56,238 --> 00:40:59,473
Emily loves to paint.
Watercolors, mostly.

970
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:01,642
They're doing a lot better now.

971
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,677
This isn't what you wanted
at all.

972
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:06,294
No. No, they're not for me.

973
00:41:13,087 --> 00:41:14,388
(Exhales)

974
00:41:16,857 --> 00:41:19,759
(Breathes deeply)

975
00:41:22,362 --> 00:41:24,196
(Plate clatters, rustling)

976
00:41:31,638 --> 00:41:33,138
Hey, turn that up.

977
00:41:33,205 --> 00:41:34,806
<i>The "Times" is reporting</i>

978
00:41:34,874 --> 00:41:36,975
<i>that C.I.A. Director</i>
<i>Grayden Osborne...</i>

979
00:41:37,043 --> 00:41:38,677
(Abby and Harrison) Olivia! <i>Was
found dead earlier this evening,</i>

980
00:41:38,745 --> 00:41:41,046
<i>the victim</i>
<i>of an apparent suicide.</i>

981
00:41:41,113 --> 00:41:43,448
<i>A body found inside a vehicle</i>
<i>in rock creek park</i>

982
00:41:43,516 --> 00:41:47,184
<i>has allegedly been identified</i>
<i>as that of Osborne.</i>

983
00:41:47,252 --> 00:41:49,820
<i>The Central Intelligence Agency</i>
<i>has yet to make a statement.</i>

984
00:41:49,888 --> 00:41:51,255
(Sirens wailing,
police radio chatter)

985
00:41:51,322 --> 00:41:54,992
(Camera shutter clicking)

986
00:41:57,696 --> 00:41:59,063
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

987
00:42:06,171 --> 00:42:07,604
- Hi. You mind?
- Yeah.

988
00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:11,508
(Sighs and rubs hands)

989
00:42:11,576 --> 00:42:13,210
Chilly tonight, huh?

990
00:42:13,278 --> 00:42:14,344
Supposed to drop
even more tomorrow.

991
00:42:14,412 --> 00:42:16,346
Hmm.

992
00:42:16,414 --> 00:42:18,715
So it's done?

993
00:42:18,783 --> 00:42:20,450
It's done.

994
00:42:20,517 --> 00:42:22,685
And the police believe
it's a suicide?

995
00:42:22,752 --> 00:42:25,488
Hook, line, and sinker.

996
00:42:25,556 --> 00:42:28,958
I have to say,
it was staged perfectly.

997
00:42:29,025 --> 00:42:31,127
And now everyone thinks
that Osborne is the mole.

998
00:42:31,195 --> 00:42:32,895
- Hmm.
- Or was.

999
00:42:34,764 --> 00:42:37,532
Well... you stay warm now.

1000
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,733
Yeah, you, too.
