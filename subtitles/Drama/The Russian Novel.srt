1
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:12,946
When he passes me,
I cannot see him;

2
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:16,245
when he goes by,
I cannot perceive him. (Job 8:14)

3
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:11,570
A man was fishing all night.

4
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,670
He kept catching
and releasing the fish.

5
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:27,912
Another man asked
why he kept doing it.

6
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,292
He answered,

7
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:40,025
"I'm looking for the damn fish
I almost caught yesterday."

8
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:41,693
Another fisherman thought about
the fish being caught and released.

9
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:46,062
He wondered if any of them was the one
the man almost caught.

10
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,101
He decided to stop chasing
after his wife.

11
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,477
You read it.
Say something.

12
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,044
I like the beginning

13
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,514
and the ending.

14
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,717
That's it?

15
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:21,024
Interesting

16
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,328
but not well-written.

17
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:34,145
Another fisherman told Sinhyo
unbelievable things about his runaway wife.

18
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:42,578
The man didn't trust him,
but he wanted a listening ear.

19
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:49,828
Luckily, Sinhyo wanted to listen,
ready to believe anything.

20
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:56,302
Jungsuk said strangers told
him about his wife's real identity.

21
00:03:56,803 --> 00:04:06,678
It was like a huge secret
at first but didn't matter now.

22
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:13,850
She was an 'Avian Kind',
which went extinct a million years ago.

23
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:19,586
Sinhyo wasn't surprised
and kept listening.

24
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,465
You only went fishing, right?

25
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:46,543
You didn't tell uncle about me
not being at the carpenter's shop?

26
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,657
Anybody come to the shop,

27
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,129
looking for my wife?

28
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,830
Who else but you?

29
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,138
Hello?

30
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,443
Father's not home.

31
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:24,852
He doesn't read just anything.

32
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:30,561
How else should I call it then?

33
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,660
Why are you cussing?

34
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,205
Can you lend me a book?

35
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,004
What kind?

36
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,279
Dad told me to ask you.

37
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,344
He said smart people
know everything.

38
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,722
Garim's dad was father's student.

39
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,254
After his divorce,
he came to live at 'Wuyeonje'.

40
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:07,691
Father got him a teaching job
but he could never stick to anything.

41
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,070
Weird, long names.

42
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:16,708
Something "ski" and "skaya".

43
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,146
It's about a father and
son loving the same woman.

44
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,340
It's good.

45
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,943
So complicated.

46
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,647
The characters are like you.

47
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:30,418
Slow, long, complicated...

48
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,750
You're like a Russian novel.

49
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,868
Did you show him my manuscript?

50
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,805
You're rude, like on the phone.

51
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,706
Don't send it to him.

52
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,542
He doesn't like getting random stuff.

53
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,416
Think you know all about him?

54
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,691
I know him better than you.

55
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:12,725
Is it so hard to ask him to read it?

56
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,470
It just won't happen that way.

57
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,172
Don't you get it?

58
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:30,546
No other writers could understand
me except your dad, Gijin Kim.

59
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,781
I'm not trying to prove anything

60
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:41,889
but if he reads it,
I'd be happy to die today.

61
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:48,498
Then write it again and send it.

62
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:52,630
He wouldn't read
a line of your poor writing now.

63
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,870
I'm not kidding.

64
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:01,340
Do it again and send it.

65
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:07,312
Tell me how.

66
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:13,085
The plot could be interesting

67
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,093
but the writing itself is terrible.

68
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:26,405
I'm not a writer but
shouldn't writing be properly clothed?

69
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:31,635
I... never studied,

70
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,337
never went to school.

71
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,785
Teach me.

72
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:48,259
He came with a revised
script every week

73
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:51,225
and went home with assignments,

74
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,661
like a good student.

75
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:59,237
I wasn't bold enough to
ignore my dad's literature.

76
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,466
So I created a Drama Society.

77
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:12,507
We performed 2 or 3 times
a year in front of friends.

78
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,617
So fucking awkward.

79
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:23,056
Jehye was the only one
who wasn't a friend.

80
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:29,063
She started revising scripts and
memorized lines with us.

81
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:34,971
She asked questions.

82
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,935
Perhaps, she didn't notice.

83
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:43,641
Unlike her, we were
trying to escape reality.

84
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:50,356
Why do you never
perform your dad's work?

85
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:55,822
She always asked questions
and never talked about herself.

86
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,598
Why the same play
all year around?

87
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,431
How about posters?

88
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,170
I only knew her age,

89
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,675
that her major was nursing and
that her father is a pastor.

90
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:12,805
Why do we drink while
talking about others?

91
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,215
When I asked her a question,

92
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:19,914
she would simply stare
back with an open look.

93
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,756
What's wrong with you?

94
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,991
Want a fight, asshole?

95
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,570
Fuck!
I can't beat you!

96
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,470
Stop it!

97
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,335
Fucking nerds.

98
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,278
Don't hit me!

99
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,677
Even my father never lays
his hand on me.

100
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,213
Stop!
What's wrong?

101
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,384
The fucker insulted Gijin Kim.

102
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:55,355
"His philosophy reflects
the shortcomings of our time."

103
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,523
How is that an insult?

104
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,081
I can't voice my own view?

105
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,055
If you want to understand, study!

106
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:01,995
Asshole!

107
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,622
Stop it!

108
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,421
Go inside.

109
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:10,270
All you read is his works.

110
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,329
That's the extent of your
understanding, moron.

111
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,710
Everyone likes his works.

112
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,450
Tell Sunghwan I'm off.

113
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:30,654
I've read it all,
your writing.

114
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,561
Which ones?

115
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,028
All of them.

116
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,632
"Hammer", "Whispers in the Ear",
"Potion of a Thousand Years".

117
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,497
Do you want to
read my other stuff?

118
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:55,341
It was her first time
to express her view.

119
00:11:55,782 --> 00:12:03,814
A rare thing. She realized
it as it was happening.

120
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:09,351
He took her to the carpenter's shop.

121
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,290
It was cold and far,

122
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:17,631
so when they arrived,
they were sober.

123
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,105
I can write
all night like this.

124
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:35,118
I can't sit at the desk
after working all day.

125
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:38,847
You live here?

126
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,956
My uncle sent me here.

127
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:48,757
I have to earn a living.

128
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:56,608
I never read other novels
besides Mr. Kim's.

129
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,812
I did check out other books,

130
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,643
but I couldn't finish them
unlike Mr. Kim's.

131
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:14,620
Am I too dumb to write?

132
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,386
You're brilliant.

133
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,503
To me... you're a genius.

134
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:46,321
Sinhyo asked me to introduce
other writers besides my dad.

135
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:51,426
I recommended those
staying at 'Wuyeonje'.

136
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:57,332
He read Garim's father's works
and asked to meet him.

137
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,215
Been waiting for us?

138
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:26,927
It was both hard
and easy to read her.

139
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:30,370
She was expressionless,

140
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,170
but somehow her eyes
were so expressive.

141
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:40,243
I learned that you can express
a lot without saying or doing much.

142
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:48,720
When we went to catch the bus,
she mumbled, "There is a shortcut."

143
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:57,761
Without waiting for us,
she went ahead to the Bamboo Forest.

144
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:15,746
We are the only ones
allowed to trespass.

145
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,774
Who's "we"?

146
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,915
People at 'Wuyeonje'.

147
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,335
Anybody live there?

148
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,605
A shaman used to.

149
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:52,583
Garim told us about the shaman
and about her potion.

150
00:15:53,186 --> 00:16:00,183
She said the shaman's father's father and
his father's father made the potion

151
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:04,322
that fakes death
and raises one 3 days later.

152
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:09,328
Grind, mix and boil it.

153
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:13,068
The potion can fake death for 3 days.

154
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,139
I heard it took more than
1,000 years to make it.

155
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,803
The shaman made it?

156
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,444
You fall for such stories?

157
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,219
You made it up?

158
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,396
I took the bus back.

159
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:49,169
Kyungmi Lee made her
debut when she was 19.

160
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,869
She was a shoe factory worker.

161
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:55,248
It was the first time
for Gijin Kim to let a young,

162
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:58,445
female writer to stay at 'Wuyeonje '.

163
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:03,515
She didn't talk to us
on the way back.

164
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,951
She was different
with the writers at 'Wuyeonje '.

165
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:11,731
She wasn't talkative,
but by simply answering questions,

166
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,359
she dominated discussions.

167
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:23,698
How dare he call it trash cos
it's not about "the suffering of our times"?

168
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,780
Everyone's entitled to
their view but

169
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:33,241
why did he say it after
being on the judge panel?

170
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:38,856
He's making a point that the book's
success is thanks to him. Pathetic.

171
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:45,932
They seemed to be
discussing mundane stuff

172
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:52,505
but their talks were filled
with social views

173
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:56,703
- and literary philosophy.
- He said I lost my objectivity.

174
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,839
I said it depends on
one's mark in life.

175
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:03,916
I never considered myself special.

176
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:08,182
Kyungmi told her life stories
in relation to her book;

177
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:13,850
her labor union involvement and
the attempted rape by her step-dad.

178
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:21,092
She was serene and
persuasive, like her books.

179
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,811
Are you a writer?

180
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,309
Only writers who have published
are allowed here.

181
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,611
I'm just here with a friend.

182
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,387
I could tell.

183
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:52,258
You're so young,
but talented.

184
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,391
I didn't go to school properly.

185
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,399
Show me your works.

186
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,738
They're available
at the bookstore.

187
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:12,378
I'm also a writer.

188
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:17,011
I'm curious how you did it,
being so young.

189
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,554
I didn't get a good education.

190
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:25,396
I want to learn but
don't know where to begin,

191
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,325
who to ask.

192
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,662
Everyone's so smart.

193
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:35,099
It's hard to follow
what they are saying.

194
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:39,103
Want to look at my writing?

195
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,707
Next morning,

196
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:50,978
father called and told me to fetch
a package from the post office.

197
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,990
I left early.

198
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:57,092
I thought others were asleep.

199
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,132
Off to school?

200
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:07,971
On vacation.

201
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,997
Where are you going?

202
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,136
Going for a walk.

203
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:15,681
Where to?

204
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,114
I'll give you a ride.

205
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,115
I finished the books.

206
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,078
Huh?

207
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:26,154
The books you lent me.

208
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,929
Want more?

209
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,727
What were they?

210
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,796
Russian novels.

211
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:39,963
Ah...

212
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,370
Then how about French novels?

213
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,742
Japanese novels are also good.

214
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:51,941
You know a beech tree looks like?

215
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:56,252
Well... I've never seen one.

216
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:03,825
All your books mentioned
the beech tree.

217
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,262
How come you don't know
what they are?

218
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:13,928
How can you recommend those books
when you don't know that tree?

219
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:26,241
I went to the public library to
look up the beech tree.

220
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,707
He must be running errands
for his dad.

221
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:59,315
Doesn't Mr. Gijin Kim
come here often?

222
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,715
He rarely comes.

223
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,921
Even when he does,
no one knows.

224
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,493
Did you read my stuff?

225
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:18,234
Yes, more interesting that I thought.

226
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:26,840
You have no shame,
showing it to everyone.

227
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:30,646
That's it?

228
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,159
Where are you going?

229
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,996
I have a class in Gwanju.

230
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,630
Teaching or attending?

231
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:54,935
You must be teaching as
you're a writer despite being young.

232
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:58,072
Your manuscript's on my desk.

233
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,874
It's faster to take the shortcut
than waiting for the bus.

234
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:20,695
I heard 'Wuyeonje' people are
the only ones allowed to trespass.

235
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:26,336
I wish I could become a writer
and live at 'Wooyeonje'.

236
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,072
What did you think of my writing?

237
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:32,871
The stories were so ridiculous.

238
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,748
You mean it wasn't good?

239
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:40,819
I'm not as talented as you.

240
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,379
That's not for me to judge.

241
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:48,516
All the villagers take this path.

242
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,461
It used to be quiet
because of tramps.

243
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:56,227
You know so much.

244
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:57,863
I envy you.

245
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,471
So young yet so knowledgeable.

246
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:05,507
To build something,
shouldn't you work on the foundation first?

247
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,913
Talented or not,

248
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:11,742
to build something,
you need a good foundation.

249
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:15,782
And then,
you need good soil.

250
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:22,383
Giving advice to a person

251
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:28,996
without any foundation
is pointless.

252
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:33,964
Wow, how do you know that?

253
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,840
Being so young and
without a good education?

254
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,982
He talked about his childhood.

255
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:48,443
His mother killed herself after
killing his abusive father.

256
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:53,417
He didn't consider himself unlucky

257
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:59,387
but if it takes self-reflection
to be a writer,

258
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:02,056
that's what he'll do from now.

259
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:05,335
He kept talking about his life;

260
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,904
how he survived
with the help of relatives,

261
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,575
how he had to do hard work.

262
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,673
His story was shocking
but predictable.

263
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:22,546
He never considered
his life as a topic for writing.

264
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:28,324
He said we're all meant to
suffer to a certain degree.

265
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,293
So...

266
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:36,699
Dismissing reality can also
become a form of expression.

267
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:42,902
Garim never told anyone
about not going to school.

268
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,870
Nobody paid attention to her,

269
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:50,241
but she hated having to
explain herself to anybody.

270
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:55,542
Her friends also liked listening to
Garim talk about them.

271
00:25:56,522 --> 00:26:01,824
She thought her life
wasn't special or painful.

272
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:07,029
Isn't everyone's life that way?

273
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:11,028
She hated thinking deeply
about her life.

274
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:14,534
Talking about others was fun.

275
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:20,443
Compared to Russian novels,
the world was full of shorter,

276
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:25,346
simpler and chaotic stories.

277
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:29,610
I want to know
what people think of me.

278
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,314
I have an idea.

279
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:40,226
A shaman buried a
1,000-ear-old potion near here.

280
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,533
If you drink it, you'll die for 3 days
and then come back to life.

281
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,861
You saying I should take it?

282
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:49,469
If they think you're dead,
they'll reveal their true feelings about you.

283
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:53,501
Any side-effects?

284
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,574
You believe this story?

285
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,422
What if you find it?

286
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:04,855
When should I take it?

287
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:09,252
Take it near those
whose feelings you're curious about.

288
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,397
Why aren't you
at school anymore?

289
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,235
You don't like talking?

290
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,700
You talk a lot, though.

291
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,868
I just listen.

292
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:28,340
If you listen carefully,
you end up whispering back unconsciously.

293
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:32,046
It's different from talking.

294
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,016
I have to go to the cram school.

295
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:38,619
O.K.
I'll tell you if I find it.

296
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,600
How long are you staying here?

297
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,731
Don't know.

298
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:55,570
There isn't a time limit
for writing a book.

299
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,041
Working on a book?

300
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,843
What's it about?

301
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:04,815
Another story about factory girls?

302
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:05,684
Abused Women?

303
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,083
You know what?

304
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:10,019
I'm not like you.

305
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:13,148
I don't babble on about my work.

306
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:16,358
Why follow me all day?

307
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,626
If you have nothing better to do,

308
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:27,130
study grammar,
spelling and punctuation.

309
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,905
I didn't get a proper education.

310
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:39,550
I'm sorry but I get sensitive
when writing a book.

311
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:42,711
I wish I could help.

312
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,482
But I'm too preoccupied.

313
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,518
Sinhyo was envious of Kyungmi:

314
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,061
her artistic sensitivity
when she writes,

315
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:57,033
her cool attitude to all the praise

316
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:01,432
and that she's a writer
working at Wuyeonje.

317
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,437
He never considered his work
to be shameful or meaningless.

318
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:11,214
But after meeting
the writers at 'Wuyeonje ',

319
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:16,778
he realized his work
might never get published.

320
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:30,432
Sinhyo left
without a word next morning.

321
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,961
He didn't reappear for a while.

322
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,047
Nobody asked about
his whereabouts.

323
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:50,789
After 2 months, he came back.

324
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,280
He'd been in his hometown.

325
00:29:55,327 --> 00:30:00,196
Sungmin went to art school
but performed music.

326
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:05,729
Jihyun also majored in art,
but she also played music.

327
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:11,637
Maybe that's why they kept
on dating and breaking up.

328
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,810
I wasn't sure if they were in love.

329
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,280
Nothing seemed different whether
they were dating or not.

330
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:26,090
We' re going out.

331
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:29,683
For real?

332
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,387
Yeah.

333
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,396
We broke up.

334
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,194
Really?

335
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,162
Really.

336
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,894
We got back together.

337
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,670
There was something
different about Sinhyo.

338
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:51,583
He was always restless
but when he came back,

339
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,347
he wasn't the same.

340
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:58,217
He talked about the past 2 months.

341
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:03,053
He seemed excited,
but not the way he used to be.

342
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:08,089
He worked as if work is a blessing.

343
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,463
Sweating and quenching his thirst,

344
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:15,536
he believed it'd
somehow change him.

345
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:21,672
His stay at 'Wuyeonje ' changed him.

346
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:31,914
Being a writer doesn't have
a special meaning, he thought.

347
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:37,424
He worked like a man with
no other purpose in life.

348
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,990
He decided not to chase
after his wife.

349
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:46,704
He was determined to
forget about her.

350
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,129
You weren't around, so...

351
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,412
Hope I'm not bothering you.

352
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,929
I was worried about you.

353
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:55,029
Sunghwan said you were
out of touch for long.

354
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,405
Do I have to be with you?

355
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,111
No...

356
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:12,657
I don't want to give you
any pressure.

357
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,249
Don't get me wrong.

358
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:18,689
I thought about what I'm doing.

359
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:29,768
I thought Mr. Kim could
understand my work,

360
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:34,537
but turns out that's
not the solution.

361
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,151
I...

362
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,260
I really think your writing is...

363
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:54,199
I thought all I need were wing

364
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,530
but that wasn't it.

365
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:05,376
I'm only a puppy.

366
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:06,778
If a tiger gets wings,

367
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,838
he can soar high
and devour eagles.

368
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:17,079
If a puppy gets wings,

369
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:28,158
what difference does it make?

370
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:32,859
I still like your writing
more than anything.

371
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:41,646
No other writing made
me stay up all night.

372
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:44,114
I couldn't put it down.

373
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:48,417
I read "Avian Kind" many times.

374
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:56,223
I don't know what you
mean by a puppy and wings.

375
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,496
They are amazing.

376
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,158
You should keep on writing.

377
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:08,001
There's no meaning in writing.

378
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,636
They have meaning to me.

379
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:20,718
I don't care if you think
you're good or not, but keep writing.

380
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:24,248
I said his imagination
was phenomenal,

381
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:27,416
however good others may be.

382
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:33,794
His imagination was
beyond our time.

383
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:42,738
I half-understood what
I was saying but he was moved.

384
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:47,646
He explained how he got
the idea for "Avian Kind"

385
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,046
from writer Jungsuk Kim.

386
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:55,951
He went to his hometown having
decided to write again.

387
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:21,979
He told his uncle that
he's quitting his job to write,

388
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,717
that he's only there to write.

389
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:34,422
His uncle sighed, disappointed.

390
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:40,288
Never slept more than
4 hours in the last 2 months.

391
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:45,631
My fingers kept on moving until
the finger prints disappeared.

392
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:48,668
So?
Any difference now?

393
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:52,200
It's not complete.

394
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:56,076
I worked one and half months
on the one you read.

395
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,178
Working on something new now.

396
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,016
The main character's based
on you.

397
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:01,682
Me?

398
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,412
More beer?

399
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,922
Yeah.

400
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:11,088
What are you talking about?

401
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:13,490
Nothing much.

402
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,232
I love your music.

403
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,466
When you have some time,

404
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:21,497
let's hang and listen to music.

405
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:27,171
I want to hang out with
cool people like you.

406
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:32,844
I didn't get a good education,
you see.

407
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,045
Cut it out.

408
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:37,347
She's Sungmin's girlfriend.

409
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,446
No, we broke up.

410
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,116
Really?

411
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,984
Really.

412
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:45,890
Always wanted to date a musician.

413
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:52,002
Don't take it too seriously.

414
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,272
I just love your music.

415
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:58,072
Do you always categorize
women you're interested in?

416
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,143
Sorry?

417
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:02,043
He's in trouble now.

418
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,150
Do you always sort
women into jobs like musicians,

419
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,449
students or homemakers?

420
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,623
I haven't dated many women.

421
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:15,554
What about Jehye?

422
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:19,130
What?

423
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,032
What's going on
with you and Jehye?

424
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,727
I thought she was staying with you.

425
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:29,898
I came to find him.

426
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:31,970
What you doing?

427
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:34,504
Cooped up at home
since you came back.

428
00:38:35,013 --> 00:38:36,139
Get lost.

429
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:40,409
I guess you did hang out
with college kids in Seoul.

430
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,611
Go, dumbass!

431
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:46,419
I brought this pretty girl
who was looking for you.

432
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,900
You said it was a pretty girl.

433
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,502
Like someone bewitched,

434
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:08,545
he slept, smoked and
wrote in the same position.

435
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:12,211
I wasn't worried.

436
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,517
It's only that I wasn't a big help.

437
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:21,086
I never lived my life for
someone else before.

438
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,851
You may not understand.

439
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:26,060
I don't.

440
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,294
But I hope you do understand.

441
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:42,370
Is this meant to be fun?

442
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:59,188
If it weren't for me,
he'd have collapsed.

443
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,967
He spent the month without
seeing the sunlight,

444
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,901
in the same position.

445
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:10,907
I didn't want to stop him.

446
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:14,370
It may be hard to believe,

447
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:18,742
but it's the first time I feel I'm doing
something meaningful in life.

448
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:27,057
It's been over a month and
something amazing is happening.

449
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:32,429
I wish you could read
his works again.

450
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:36,227
Someday, he will be appreciated.

451
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:41,834
Why are you doing this?

452
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:49,405
Not everything
has to have a reason.

453
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:55,145
Don't worry,
I chose this.

454
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:02,022
If you want,
I can leave.

455
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:12,831
Do you like me?

456
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,201
You like my writing?

457
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:24,147
I'm not the type to love
or hate things.

458
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:32,249
I just know your writing's good.

459
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:40,861
I want to share this moment
when you're creating something.

460
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:45,729
Never knew city girls were this easy.

461
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:51,106
Always wanted to live a meaningful life,
even for a moment.

462
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:54,112
I may never save anyone but

463
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:59,448
I can help someone
create something great.

464
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:12,121
What's that?

465
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:16,964
Your fingers hurt.

466
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:20,370
Once you get used to it,
it'll be easier.

467
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:24,805
Too noisy.

468
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,341
Working on something new?

469
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:31,205
Yeah.

470
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:40,514
A famous writer's son secretly
rewrites his father's work.

471
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:44,523
He sends it secretly by post.

472
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:48,356
To his father?

473
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:50,430
It arrives months later sent

474
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,330
from a different name.

475
00:42:54,338 --> 00:43:00,402
The son thinks it's much
better than his father's.

476
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,680
Two emotions clash,

477
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:09,408
love and hate towards his father.

478
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:21,123
The son kills himself
and no one knows.

479
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,431
His father's reputation
soars sky high.

480
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,170
Great.

481
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:31,866
It's like a Greek tragedy.

482
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:38,682
The son's suicide sounds cheesy.

483
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:44,889
But can't come up
with a better ending.

484
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:49,849
Still, it's beautiful that he dies.

485
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:56,423
A pastor's daughter
shouldn't talk like that.

486
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:02,663
The new piece is incredible.

487
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:06,174
It's still rough yet,

488
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:09,375
it sweeps up your emotions.

489
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,846
His writing opens up
a mysterious world.

490
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:15,811
This shall be a masterpiece.

491
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:20,984
You might think
the suicide is ridiculous and immature.

492
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:30,057
If some story continues after suicide,
that will be great.

493
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,799
On my opinion.

494
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,035
All tragedies have time.

495
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:47,317
As time goes on,
it either becomes a tragedy or comedy.

496
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:55,925
Your music has such beauty.

497
00:44:57,195 --> 00:45:05,830
Makes you wonder
what'll happen after a long time.

498
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:09,464
Can't you keep
your thoughts to yourself?

499
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:12,202
Right,

500
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:14,442
right!

501
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:18,377
Why can't I do that?

502
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:20,313
Why am I so talkative?

503
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:25,950
Do you like novels?

504
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:27,684
No, I don't.

505
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,488
Wait,

506
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:35,433
you don't have to like them,
but can I show you my work?

507
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:37,560
You really hate novels?

508
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:39,865
Ok, I'll read it.

509
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:51,881
I've always wanted to
date a musician.

510
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:55,980
He seemed more confident.

511
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,516
There was something
different about him now.

512
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:08,299
What's this?

513
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:09,493
Give it to me later.

514
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,166
Skim through it.

515
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,668
I made changes.

516
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:23,005
Except for the opening and ending,

517
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:28,908
not much had changed.

518
00:46:30,388 --> 00:46:35,724
Still rough but there
was a sense of direction now.

519
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:41,024
Maybe he's different
because of what he wrote.

520
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:46,667
Maybe I knew all along
this day would come.

521
00:46:47,872 --> 00:46:52,832
Now people will be drawn into
his world of ideas.

522
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:11,758
You' re Sumin, right?

523
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,499
We met last week.

524
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:19,570
We have met but...

525
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:20,901
Remember?

526
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:22,695
The concert?

527
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,468
We met at Wuyeonje.

528
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:28,508
Oh, right!

529
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:31,843
I'm sorry.

530
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,509
I knew we'd met.

531
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,914
Do you still write?

532
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:45,959
Bits and pieces.

533
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,064
Still showing it to everyone?

534
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,168
Taking the bus?

535
00:47:57,775 --> 00:47:59,333
The subway.

536
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:03,547
I need to go.

537
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,673
Call me.

538
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:11,689
So absent-minded.

539
00:48:11,689 --> 00:48:13,554
I didn't give you my number.

540
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:19,926
Where are you going?

541
00:48:21,532 --> 00:48:22,726
Home.

542
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:28,398
And you?

543
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:30,667
Going home.

544
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:34,968
Want to come?

545
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,012
To my place?

546
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:42,376
No, to my place in Paju.

547
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:46,514
Heard of it?

548
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:54,795
So rural.

549
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,194
Outside Seoul it's all like that.

550
00:49:00,171 --> 00:49:01,934
I love it here.

551
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:05,169
The factory where
I used to work was near here.

552
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:10,242
Back then,
I was desperate to get out

553
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:13,384
but it's good to be back.

554
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:14,817
I can write here.

555
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:22,189
What are you working on now?

556
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:28,761
It's about a famous writer
and his son.

557
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:30,690
Mr. Gijin Kim?

558
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:34,004
I don't have anyone
particular in mind.

559
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:35,494
How can you not?

560
00:49:35,873 --> 00:49:38,706
You see what you see
and hear what you hear.

561
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,140
I finished it this morning

562
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:16,412
and decided to show it to
the first person I meet today.

563
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:24,748
Doing something for the first time
is always good, right?

564
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:32,524
Sure I can read it?

565
00:50:33,297 --> 00:50:34,730
Told you.

566
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:41,032
I was going to get the
first person I find to read it.

567
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:43,698
You hit the jackpot.

568
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:47,500
It was different
from her other works.

569
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,305
A love story but hard to
tell if they're in love.

570
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:54,783
Obscure but I was sure
critics would like it.

571
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:59,388
Complex but there was
strength in its clarity.

572
00:50:59,657 --> 00:51:02,717
Scenes with the lovers
made me uneasy.

573
00:51:03,027 --> 00:51:07,930
This was how successful
writers write.

574
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:10,932
Enjoying it?

575
00:51:12,036 --> 00:51:13,367
Pretty good.

576
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:22,978
I think I get it but
I'm not sure.

577
00:51:26,717 --> 00:51:28,651
Want to stay for breakfast?

578
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:37,093
Being with her in the room
felt uneasy and comfy.

579
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:40,426
Like reading her work.

580
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,728
It felt new.

581
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:53,076
If you want to work at 'Wuyeonje',
let me know.

582
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:56,242
I am not even a published writer.

583
00:51:57,815 --> 00:52:00,113
I meant you can stay
in my room there.

584
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:11,588
Do you use that in a war?

585
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:14,724
Of course.

586
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:21,799
This helps?

587
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:25,299
Even against tanks?

588
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:49,165
It'll be tough to be
in love with me.

589
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,398
Are you 100% sure?

590
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:53,725
Fuck,

591
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,863
you can't expect certainty
from a man.

592
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:09,210
Why did I kill my love?

593
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,185
Why did I have to?

594
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:16,121
It wasn't on purpose.

595
00:53:16,894 --> 00:53:21,888
You're like someone
born to kill him.

596
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:26,628
Was it on an impulse
or planned?

597
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,175
I'm not sure.

598
00:53:31,175 --> 00:53:32,540
I don't understand.

599
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:36,980
She can't be caught
or understood by people.

600
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:46,355
I know it's tough but we're not
here to do something easy.

601
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:55,888
I don't want to do this any more.

602
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:04,169
We've been doing
the same play for 2 years.

603
00:54:05,843 --> 00:54:10,041
I don't want to pretend to be doing
something worthy when we're not.

604
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:30,494
Are you still seeing Sinhyo?

605
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:32,995
Why do you ask?

606
00:54:36,173 --> 00:54:38,300
I think it's better for you not to.

607
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,275
Why?

608
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:48,716
You know.

609
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:51,111
You are regretting it.

610
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:58,023
Such a strange man.

611
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:04,457
He seems to hear and know everything
but doesn't say anything.

612
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:07,297
Why does he bring it up now?

613
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:09,837
So strange.

614
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:17,140
How come you're here so early?

615
00:55:21,385 --> 00:55:24,047
I wanted to stop
by before school.

616
00:55:24,755 --> 00:55:26,620
Good job.

617
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,325
Think you're my girlfriend?

618
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:43,099
No.

619
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:53,478
As soon as you finish,
I'll focus on my studies.

620
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,227
Lucky bastard.

621
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:11,733
An assistant!

622
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:14,994
Whatever.

623
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,029
What will you do?

624
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:21,209
Want to work at 'Wooyeonje'?

625
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:25,775
Do you think working there
will make any difference?

626
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:29,552
Better get going
before others come.

627
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:33,387
Dare to kick me out?

628
00:56:38,295 --> 00:56:41,890
Sinhyo decided to write
at 'Wuyeonje'.

629
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:46,896
He went there.

630
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:56,978
What are you looking for?

631
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,718
Still believe the story
about the potion?

632
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,379
Nothing to lose by believing it.

633
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:07,288
Want some help?

634
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:08,825
Must be near here.

635
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:09,793
Go.

636
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:11,124
You'll jinx it.

637
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:19,093
Oh, I'm bad luck?

638
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:26,774
What are you doing here?

639
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,879
I'll be using the
room for a while.

640
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:30,980
What?

641
00:57:32,082 --> 00:57:33,879
That chick let you do that?

642
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,509
Yeah.

643
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:38,679
Odd.

644
00:57:39,056 --> 00:57:43,152
I couldn't write
a word since I came here.

645
00:57:43,694 --> 00:57:45,423
Have some dumplings.

646
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:50,801
Since you're here,
we have drink.

647
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:54,202
Don't be cooped up in the room.

648
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:02,569
You seeing Kyungmi?

649
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,641
It's not like that.

650
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:07,076
What's it like then?

651
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:18,052
Don't date writers, especially
someone like Kyungmi.

652
00:58:18,362 --> 00:58:19,624
So tiresome.

653
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:24,430
Did I tell you?

654
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:25,790
What?

655
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:27,337
Same old story.

656
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,498
Don't.

657
00:58:31,575 --> 00:58:33,600
I went fishing
for 3 days nonstop.

658
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:40,181
Not a bite the whole time.

659
00:58:40,584 --> 00:58:47,581
But the guy next to me kept
on catching the fish.

660
00:58:48,425 --> 00:58:57,732
Strangely,
he kept letting them go.

661
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:00,031
Weird, huh?

662
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:03,337
Like he was making fun of me.

663
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,266
What happened?

664
00:59:06,977 --> 00:59:13,940
I asked why he kept
releasing the fish.

665
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:29,061
He said he's trying to catch the one
he caught the night before.

666
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:37,439
I got so frustrated, ended
up drinking for 3 days.

667
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:41,577
Why are you telling
the story now?

668
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:51,822
Strangely,
after listening to the story,

669
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:53,551
I had a strong urge to drink.

670
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:58,918
I was like a neutered animal.

671
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:01,391
I just drank.

672
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:06,699
Though I came to write,

673
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:09,164
I couldn't do a thing.

674
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:14,101
I was haunted by dreams.

675
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,636
I drank when I woke up.

676
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,711
I became sober only to sleep.

677
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:22,043
It was hard to tell
dreams from reality.

678
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:27,450
I tried writing
when I was sober,

679
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:29,715
but couldn't write a word.

680
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:34,731
After 3 days of drinking,

681
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:37,757
I realized 'Wuyeonje '
wasn't the place for me.

682
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,101
Going back?

683
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,375
Yeah.

684
01:00:48,879 --> 01:00:50,346
Want to go ice fishing?

685
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,808
No, I'm leaving.

686
01:01:00,924 --> 01:01:02,186
Leaving already?

687
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,349
Yes.

688
01:01:07,464 --> 01:01:09,591
Did you find that potion?

689
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,400
It was just to kill time.

690
01:01:16,573 --> 01:01:19,041
If you find it, do share it.

691
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,604
Change the beginning
and ending a bit.

692
01:01:25,315 --> 01:01:28,185
If you add a minor theme,

693
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:31,848
the contrast will become
greater in "Avian Kind".

694
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:34,212
You read it?

695
01:01:34,558 --> 01:01:36,753
It was was around.

696
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:45,927
The structure's good but,
it may be due to your personality,

697
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:52,804
your writing's not
sensitive and too naive.

698
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:56,538
Too stubborn,
overshadowing other strengths.

699
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:01,214
Why are you saying this now?

700
01:02:02,953 --> 01:02:05,717
Did we ever have time to talk?

701
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:11,451
Garim said things
no others told me.

702
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:15,128
I took her to the bus stop.

703
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:23,504
I never expected I'd have this
meaningful conversation with her.

704
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:28,867
She critiqued my loose plot.

705
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:34,139
Density doesn't come from
sentence structures

706
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:38,445
but from each letter and period.

707
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:46,552
If you treat words carelessly,
your writing loses its impact.

708
01:02:49,032 --> 01:02:51,830
Where did you learn that?
You don't even go to school.

709
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:54,766
You can't learn stuff like that
at school.

710
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:01,575
Amazing.

711
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:07,107
If I was like you at your age,
I'd have done great things.

712
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:16,851
Garim could become a greater
writer than her dad.

713
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:23,225
Despite the lack of education,
she was talented like Kyungmi.

714
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:27,325
But she wasn't uncomfortable
to be with unlike Kyungmi.

715
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:33,334
Maybe it was because Garim had no
intention to become a famous writer.

716
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:45,686
Sinhyo didn't have anywhere to
go in Seoul, so he went to Kyungmi's.

717
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:48,958
After the talk with Garim,

718
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:53,918
it felt right to work
at Kyungmi's place.

719
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:02,471
I'm not sure where he is.

720
01:04:02,739 --> 01:04:06,072
He wasn't at 'Wuyeonje '.

721
01:04:06,443 --> 01:04:08,604
He 'd already left.

722
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:17,716
Please, can you show
the scripts to Mr. Gijin Kim?

723
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:21,120
I know it's not easy,

724
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:26,318
but I have to do it for him.

725
01:04:35,572 --> 01:04:36,937
What are you doing?

726
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:39,941
What am I doing?

727
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:43,509
I am the landlady.

728
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:48,576
What's wrong?

729
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:54,081
What are you doing?

730
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:59,693
I'm the landlady.

731
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:17,640
What you looking at, asshole?

732
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:22,310
She wasn't getting
the recognition she deserved.

733
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:24,917
She wasn't sure

734
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:29,724
but she thought it's because
of her age and background.

735
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:35,391
She wasn't nominated for any
of the literary awards.

736
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:42,194
Some panel judges took her out,
saying they'll cheer her up.

737
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:47,670
But in fact, they were hoping that she'd
make a fool of herself after drinking.

738
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:54,778
She ended up
losing control and

739
01:05:55,185 --> 01:06:06,926
criticized authors old enough
to be her father.

740
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:11,229
Think I'm a joke?

741
01:06:18,608 --> 01:06:20,701
Weirdo!

742
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:29,779
Being weird doesn't mean anything!

743
01:06:31,254 --> 01:06:37,557
You are nothing.

744
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:48,593
You'll never make it.

745
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:53,873
Other guys won't
tell you that point.

746
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:58,077
You'll never make it.

747
01:06:58,882 --> 01:07:02,613
You obsess over tiny things,

748
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:07,486
can't see the big picture.

749
01:07:11,794 --> 01:07:16,026
Neither a poem nor a novel.

750
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:26,731
Nothing in Korean literature will
embrace your style.

751
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:31,409
Give up.

752
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:07,150
Let me sleep over at yours?

753
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:08,515
Got nowhere to go.

754
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:11,986
I heard you left 'Wuyeonje'.

755
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:17,153
I showed him your work.

756
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:22,296
You can see him
at school tomorrow.

757
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:58,633
I love your songs.

758
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:02,427
I love a woman who loves music,

759
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:05,141
who can play the guitar.

760
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,200
Sick and tired of hearing that.

761
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:15,048
Hey, show me some affection.

762
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:18,115
Stop it.

763
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:19,912
Don't you want to see
my father tomorrow?

764
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:26,291
Ah, your father.

765
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,090
Asshole,

766
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:34,628
why didn't you show it
to him earlier?

767
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:39,198
I'm so excited.

768
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:41,876
You have no idea.

769
01:09:42,445 --> 01:09:47,473
If it weren't for your dad,
I'd have been dead by now.

770
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:52,682
Have you read
Mr. Gijin Kim's work?

771
01:09:52,822 --> 01:09:55,086
Told you,
I don't read novels.

772
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:00,623
So hot!

773
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:04,289
I so want to date a musician.

774
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:07,832
How old are you?

775
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:11,964
How much older was Yoko
compared to John Lennon?

776
01:10:12,075 --> 01:10:14,669
Do you know how much
John Lennon earns each year?

777
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:20,606
So worldly.

778
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,477
I can also be worldly.

779
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:25,644
We'd make a great duo.

780
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:28,414
Get out.

781
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:32,787
Go and sleep on the streets.

782
01:10:35,031 --> 01:10:36,794
Asshole!

783
01:10:40,937 --> 01:10:42,165
Fuck it.

784
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:45,439
Can't you even pretend
to pity me?

785
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:50,909
Stupid fucker...

786
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,242
Grow up.

787
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:55,847
I wish I could live recklessly
like you.

788
01:10:57,453 --> 01:11:00,183
Why did you show it
to him now?

789
01:11:00,523 --> 01:11:03,924
Afraid of me getting
approved by your dad?

790
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:09,732
People who have much and
know much are such morons.

791
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:12,132
Stop it.
I'm going.

792
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:18,804
I wish I could live doing
whatever I want.

793
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,305
Grow up.

794
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:35,284
Can I...

795
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:38,359
go see your father tomorrow?

796
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:48,032
A miracle.

797
01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:51,673
He came to dawn prayer.

798
01:11:52,542 --> 01:11:54,567
He was drunk.

799
01:11:59,182 --> 01:12:02,982
I shouldn't be coming here drunk.

800
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:17,060
I was praying that God would
let me see him again.

801
01:12:20,603 --> 01:12:22,833
I quit my job,
got no place to go.

802
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:26,932
If I go back,
they'll kill me.

803
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:33,606
I am so tired.

804
01:12:42,425 --> 01:12:45,394
As I got warm,
sleep came over me.

805
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:51,299
Heard verses from the Bible,
from the Gospel of John.

806
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:56,602
Peter asked how
other disciples would die.

807
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:59,706
Jesus said,

808
01:13:00,276 --> 01:13:04,713
"Why does it matter to you?"

809
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:08,716
With that, I fell asleep.

810
01:13:09,185 --> 01:13:13,485
In my dream,
Garim talked about my novels.

811
01:13:14,257 --> 01:13:20,196
I talked about Kyungmi's works,
and Garim asked why it matters to me.

812
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,468
Go in.

813
01:13:36,846 --> 01:13:38,211
He read them all?

814
01:13:40,483 --> 01:13:41,745
Just go in.

815
01:13:45,288 --> 01:13:47,688
Thanks.

816
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:52,690
Nobody was really nice to me.

817
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:57,866
Nobody really taught me anything.

818
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:02,136
Don't expect too much.

819
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:04,564
He did say he read it.

820
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,252
You're Sunghwan's friend?

821
01:14:26,996 --> 01:14:27,894
Yes.

822
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:34,829
Why did you write that?

823
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:38,698
To amuse people?

824
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:43,507
I don't know why you wrote this.

825
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:50,447
It could be different from
what you're used to...

826
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:53,685
I've seen a lot of things like it.

827
01:14:57,293 --> 01:15:00,820
Not sure why people write
this sort of trash.

828
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:05,862
Written words remain,
while spoken words disappear.

829
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:08,660
Think hard and then write.

830
01:15:19,949 --> 01:15:24,386
It's better to
see him being hyper.

831
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:28,490
My heart breaks seeing
him like this.

832
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:32,856
I can't do anything.

833
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:36,230
I've done all I can.

834
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:45,469
Stay here
if you have nowhere to go.

835
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:51,111
Can you go to your hometown?

836
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:53,511
Not sure.

837
01:15:53,682 --> 01:15:54,979
I don't want to.

838
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:02,818
Stay.

839
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:05,818
I'll help you.

840
01:16:14,003 --> 01:16:20,602
I first read Mr. Kim's work
in middle school.

841
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:25,504
It was a page turner.

842
01:16:26,182 --> 01:16:31,085
I read everything he wrote
and anything about him.

843
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:38,724
I started writing.

844
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:43,254
I didn't mean to become a writer.

845
01:16:47,403 --> 01:16:48,768
I...

846
01:16:50,473 --> 01:16:56,139
wanted to meet him.

847
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:01,243
I thought if I do,

848
01:17:04,687 --> 01:17:12,822
my life would change.

849
01:17:15,164 --> 01:17:17,325
I don't know why.

850
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:25,330
Maybe I was fooling myself.

851
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:28,574
I don't know who to blame.

852
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:45,853
It's no one's fault.

853
01:17:49,932 --> 01:17:51,263
Stay.

854
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:01,734
I had to let him go.

855
01:18:02,278 --> 01:18:09,343
I had a feeling he'd back someday.

856
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:19,087
Thought about going back to
uncle's but if I went back,

857
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:23,665
I felt everything would be over.

858
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,661
I tried to kill time for now.

859
01:18:26,769 --> 01:18:28,862
But it wasn't easy either.

860
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:32,942
Though it was tough,

861
01:18:32,942 --> 01:18:36,173
I wanted to read
Mr. Kim's works again.

862
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:41,547
I also read the other
'Wuyeonje ' writers ' stuff.

863
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:45,779
Flipping through literary magazines,

864
01:18:46,155 --> 01:18:48,055
I found Kyungmi's writing.

865
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:51,791
Garim's father, Kyungmi,

866
01:18:52,161 --> 01:19:00,796
and others at 'Wuyeonje ' knew
why my writing couldn't be published.

867
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:04,997
Maybe I knew too.

868
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:14,739
Neither a novel nor a poem,
lacking coherency and style.

869
01:19:15,985 --> 01:19:17,282
A bastard.

870
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,316
Life's unfair.

871
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:24,022
I didn't choose to be born this
way and nor did my writing.

872
01:19:46,315 --> 01:19:50,479
I dreamt about meeting
Mr. Kim for past 10 years.

873
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,913
Now, I have nowhere to go.

874
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:57,285
I used to think being cold and
hungry wasn't a problem.

875
01:19:57,426 --> 01:19:59,986
Now I was afraid of hunger
and the cold.

876
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,433
What are you doing here?

877
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:13,866
So cold...

878
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:19,374
I was dying to get some rest.

879
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:29,519
I'll get a job soon.

880
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:31,791
You can finish it now.

881
01:20:33,629 --> 01:20:35,688
I threw it into the river.

882
01:20:38,467 --> 01:20:40,264
I remember everything.

883
01:20:57,653 --> 01:21:01,612
Jaehye rewrote everything
from her memory in 2 days.

884
01:21:01,724 --> 01:21:05,125
Sinhyo got back to work.

885
01:21:05,561 --> 01:21:13,468
He wrote as effortlessly as
he was breathing.

886
01:21:35,591 --> 01:21:37,718
What's the title?

887
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,218
Haven't decided yet.

888
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:48,462
I wish you never do.

889
01:22:01,183 --> 01:22:03,617
I'll show it to Sunghwan
when I'm done.

890
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:07,245
Why?

891
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:10,420
Want to see Mr. Kim again?

892
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:14,019
I decided while writing.

893
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:23,195
When I'm done, I'll give it
to Sunghwan then, go home.

894
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:39,015
Sinhyo finished writing
the last chapter that night.

895
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:43,125
Jaehye read it over
and over all night.

896
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:44,387
Want some medicine?

897
01:22:46,361 --> 01:22:49,626
No.
I just need to take some rest.

898
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,568
I'll copy this tomorrow.

899
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:55,862
Don't.

900
01:22:56,205 --> 01:22:57,900
I'll give it to
Sunghwan tomorrow.

901
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:01,437
That's why I'll make
copies tomorrow.

902
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:03,070
I said no.

903
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:06,943
What if you throw it into
the river like the last time?

904
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:09,783
I said no!

905
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:12,420
I'll give it to Sunghwan!

906
01:23:14,056 --> 01:23:15,887
What are you saying?

907
01:23:16,558 --> 01:23:17,923
We wrote this...

908
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:20,018
together.

909
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:22,820
Bullshit.

910
01:23:23,899 --> 01:23:25,298
Leave it.

911
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,390
He'll leave tomorrow.

912
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:58,695
He may never come back this time.

913
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:06,803
That night,
I had a vivid dream.

914
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:12,479
Garim talked
about my work in the dream.

915
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:21,518
Garim showed me the potion.

916
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:28,723
She said I could take a sip,

917
01:24:28,964 --> 01:24:32,331
saying my work may
seem different afterwards.

918
01:24:57,993 --> 01:24:59,290
What are you doing?

919
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:02,259
A sedative.

920
01:25:02,497 --> 01:25:04,294
You were in pain.

921
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,335
What?

922
01:25:06,335 --> 01:25:07,859
Why?

923
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:16,000
I don't want to see
you leave or suffer.

924
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,304
Some day,

925
01:25:20,716 --> 01:25:24,243
people will appreciate
you and your work.

926
01:25:25,654 --> 01:25:29,181
It'll make you sleep
like a dead man

927
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:34,653
for 2 or 3 days
or as long as you want.

928
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:38,023
Drink it, if you want.

929
01:25:43,071 --> 01:25:46,302
The world will be
different when you wake up.

930
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:56,381
Why?
You, too?

931
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:02,756
It won't be painful due
to the sedative.

932
01:26:04,126 --> 01:26:08,995
They'll think we killed ourselves
after writing the last book.

933
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,064
I wrote a will.

934
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:12,391
What?

935
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:18,400
I don't want to see you
leave or suffer.

936
01:26:18,707 --> 01:26:21,437
I want our work to
be remembered forever.

937
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:23,336
Fuck!

938
01:26:23,779 --> 01:26:24,871
What the hell!

939
01:26:28,817 --> 01:26:31,149
I... I didn't write it for this!

940
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:50,395
27 years later,

941
01:26:51,006 --> 01:26:53,338
Sinhyo woke up again.

942
01:27:06,188 --> 01:27:09,487
I heard on the news
that he woke up.

943
01:27:10,759 --> 01:27:12,693
It was like a miracle.

944
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:18,059
But miracles happen to
those who yearn for them.

945
01:27:19,201 --> 01:27:23,900
I was praying for that miracle.

946
01:27:25,841 --> 01:27:29,911
Sinhyo Kang,
often called the author of our era,

947
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:32,812
regained consciousness
after 27 years.

948
01:27:32,948 --> 01:27:40,616
Experts say it's a mystery that

949
01:27:41,656 --> 01:27:50,189
can't be explained
by current medical science.

950
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:05,804
I woke up from a deep slumber.

951
01:28:07,516 --> 01:28:09,950
Was it a dream within a dream?

952
01:28:10,552 --> 01:28:13,316
Everything feels like it
happened yesterday

953
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:18,252
and yet things seem distant.

954
01:28:19,861 --> 01:28:29,964
Was the sky always so transparent?

955
01:28:36,444 --> 01:28:39,174
Sinhyo, can you hear me?

956
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:46,952
- Do you recognize us?
- Sinhyo.

957
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:51,850
Can you look us?

958
01:28:54,796 --> 01:28:55,956
Sinhyo.

959
01:28:56,364 --> 01:28:58,832
Sinhyo, can you hear us?

960
01:29:01,102 --> 01:29:03,002
Can you hear us?

961
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:06,775
"The author who die in 20th century
awoke in 21st century"

962
01:29:06,775 --> 01:29:09,744
"The author who die in 20th century
awoke in 21st century"
I don't care much about what I wear.

963
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:15,240
Didn't know baldness ran
in our family.

964
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:19,782
Was it the potion?

965
01:29:20,956 --> 01:29:22,947
What happened to my hair?

966
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:26,224
You look the same to me.
Just like in the old days.

967
01:29:29,331 --> 01:29:30,491
Ready?

968
01:29:30,799 --> 01:29:35,668
Since waking up, people
suddenly want to talk to me.

969
01:29:36,071 --> 01:29:38,665
What do they want to know?

970
01:29:38,773 --> 01:29:47,841
My dreams from 27 years
or 27 years before the sleep?

971
01:29:49,851 --> 01:29:52,183
My friend said
you can use it for now.

972
01:29:54,689 --> 01:29:56,350
He's a great fan of yours.

973
01:29:56,992 --> 01:30:00,450
You came back to life
without any warning.

974
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:02,797
No time for us to prepare.

975
01:30:04,299 --> 01:30:08,201
You should stay with us,
your family.

976
01:30:10,438 --> 01:30:12,963
I didn't live with you before.

977
01:30:15,443 --> 01:30:17,673
Now, press this.

978
01:30:20,048 --> 01:30:22,016
Oh, I see.

979
01:30:22,918 --> 01:30:26,217
You must be tired.

980
01:30:26,788 --> 01:30:30,121
Minsu will come to go shopping.

981
01:30:32,127 --> 01:30:33,253
Got the card, right?

982
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:39,396
Have dinner with us.

983
01:30:40,635 --> 01:30:41,863
Yes.

984
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:48,370
Here's the card and some cash.

985
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:50,969
You swipe it.

986
01:30:51,613 --> 01:30:52,739
Swipe?

987
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:54,308
Swipe what?

988
01:30:54,716 --> 01:30:57,048
Give it to the cashier
and they'll do it.

989
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:05,158
Youngsters imagine
their future within

990
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:08,994
the boundaries
of their circumstances.

991
01:31:09,264 --> 01:31:11,755
Yet, if you get old suddenly,

992
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:16,560
you don't remember
what you imagined.

993
01:31:18,873 --> 01:31:23,936
I wanted to take time to
think about my future.

994
01:31:24,746 --> 01:31:26,304
I wasn't in a rush.

995
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:28,974
I'd been asleep for 27 years,

996
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:31,775
so no need to hurry now.

997
01:31:35,056 --> 01:31:35,920
Hello?

998
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:41,989
Did we really make it to
the semi-final at the World Cup?

999
01:31:42,130 --> 01:31:44,928
Moron.
Why are you asking me?

1000
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,559
Call the Soccer Association?

1001
01:31:50,105 --> 01:31:53,336
And what would I know
about Kim Il-sung's death?

1002
01:31:56,745 --> 01:31:59,077
Let me know
if you need any books.

1003
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:01,607
Anything else you need?

1004
01:32:04,753 --> 01:32:09,349
I need more time to
find out what I need.

1005
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:13,752
You'll see when you get to the firm,
but it's mostly relatives.

1006
01:32:31,713 --> 01:32:33,647
It's been over 10 years.

1007
01:32:33,748 --> 01:32:36,080
Someone asked
for a copyright consent.

1008
01:32:36,985 --> 01:32:40,944
We were lucky that
our family's in publishing.

1009
01:32:41,289 --> 01:32:48,627
Your writing's superb but
packaging is everything now.

1010
01:32:50,131 --> 01:32:52,224
You never met the person?

1011
01:32:53,435 --> 01:32:58,168
Uncle talked on the phone.

1012
01:32:58,606 --> 01:33:06,377
He wanted to see your writing
but there was nothing left anywhere.

1013
01:33:09,217 --> 01:33:10,809
That must have upset you.

1014
01:33:10,919 --> 01:33:13,820
Dad got a call to
go to the station.

1015
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:18,123
No one was there but the scripts.

1016
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:22,587
Not even a note.

1017
01:33:23,565 --> 01:33:28,298
So if that person had
claimed it was his writing,

1018
01:33:28,403 --> 01:33:31,065
we couldn't have done anything.

1019
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:40,812
The living legend thing was perfect for
marketing but now you're awake...

1020
01:33:42,917 --> 01:33:48,321
Once I decided to let time pass by,
I gained a peace of mind.

1021
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:52,091
I noticed many things
to enjoy in life.

1022
01:33:52,427 --> 01:33:55,555
I was once lost in time

1023
01:33:55,763 --> 01:34:00,223
but time had moved on
without waiting.

1024
01:34:01,069 --> 01:34:02,798
It was strange.

1025
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:07,738
Despite the passing of time,
people's taste doesn't change.

1026
01:34:08,209 --> 01:34:12,646
People like my works not
because they understand.

1027
01:34:12,914 --> 01:34:18,978
It's natural for the world to
change but also surreal.

1028
01:34:34,702 --> 01:34:48,014
Why don't you visit the settings
of your books for photo shoots?

1029
01:34:48,149 --> 01:34:50,344
That'd be simple.

1030
01:34:54,022 --> 01:34:57,788
We're publishing a book,
so why photos?

1031
01:34:58,026 --> 01:35:00,324
Because you aren't writing at all.

1032
01:35:03,264 --> 01:35:07,792
Why don't you
explain things properly?

1033
01:35:07,936 --> 01:35:10,871
I did.
You weren't paying attention.

1034
01:35:12,507 --> 01:35:17,968
Always talking fast.
So confusing.

1035
01:35:18,112 --> 01:35:24,108
O.K., don't do it, then.

1036
01:35:24,419 --> 01:35:25,750
I'll do it.

1037
01:35:27,288 --> 01:35:29,552
Why is everyone
in such a rush?

1038
01:35:30,325 --> 01:35:41,361
He's caught in time but
everything else changed.

1039
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:47,735
His body is older but
he stayed the same.

1040
01:35:47,842 --> 01:35:50,310
A stark contrast.

1041
01:35:50,445 --> 01:35:55,348
He looks like a sullen
young man in his 20's.

1042
01:35:57,719 --> 01:35:59,346
I need some fresh air.

1043
01:36:22,176 --> 01:36:25,942
Being in Paju brought
back memories.

1044
01:36:26,547 --> 01:36:37,082
Though there weren't
much remaining of the old Paju,

1045
01:36:38,593 --> 01:36:43,462
I walked as
if it'd rekindle old memories.

1046
01:36:44,399 --> 01:36:49,928
I remembered
what I did with Kyungmi.

1047
01:36:50,705 --> 01:36:51,865
Paju...

1048
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:55,202
Have you heard of Paju?

1049
01:37:04,485 --> 01:37:08,649
You're Sinhyo Kang, right?

1050
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:13,154
We've met.

1051
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:19,432
I don't recollect.

1052
01:37:19,534 --> 01:37:21,695
You came to our school.

1053
01:37:25,273 --> 01:37:27,571
I give lectures at many schools...

1054
01:37:27,809 --> 01:37:29,834
I am a fan.

1055
01:37:30,445 --> 01:37:31,969
I study Korean Literature.

1056
01:37:39,987 --> 01:37:42,012
You know what I'm doing?

1057
01:37:44,459 --> 01:37:48,725
I'm writing a paper on you.

1058
01:37:51,265 --> 01:37:52,289
Really?

1059
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:57,638
I knew you wouldn't believe it.

1060
01:37:57,638 --> 01:37:59,105
Such a coincidence.

1061
01:38:04,846 --> 01:38:05,972
I believe it.

1062
01:38:06,381 --> 01:38:08,474
The world is full of surprises.

1063
01:38:08,683 --> 01:38:11,413
Can I have your number?

1064
01:38:24,932 --> 01:38:32,236
I'm no good at expressing myself.

1065
01:38:33,241 --> 01:38:40,841
I'm actually ecstatic now.

1066
01:38:44,419 --> 01:38:46,114
Sleep is important.

1067
01:38:47,855 --> 01:38:53,851
If I have questions,
can I call you?

1068
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:02,459
Where have you been?

1069
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:06,031
Where is he?

1070
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:07,298
He's gone.

1071
01:39:07,408 --> 01:39:09,035
We're going to a barbecue.

1072
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:10,834
Join us?

1073
01:39:11,546 --> 01:39:12,979
No, thanks.

1074
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:30,127
Frankly,

1075
01:39:31,566 --> 01:39:36,060
I have no idea
what you're saying.

1076
01:39:36,604 --> 01:39:40,563
You're the photographer,
so do what you want.

1077
01:39:41,409 --> 01:39:45,743
But trying to capture time?
Amplify the contrast?

1078
01:39:46,013 --> 01:39:48,004
What are you saying?

1079
01:39:51,619 --> 01:39:53,143
I don't know.

1080
01:39:54,155 --> 01:39:58,854
I came up with the project.

1081
01:40:00,261 --> 01:40:04,823
You aren't just a writer

1082
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:08,860
the best known
21 st century's sleeping beauty.

1083
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:13,898
I'm interested in you.

1084
01:40:15,643 --> 01:40:17,167
Interested?

1085
01:40:18,646 --> 01:40:19,977
What?

1086
01:40:22,049 --> 01:40:24,074
Are you in right mind?

1087
01:40:24,619 --> 01:40:26,746
Do you know
how much older I am?

1088
01:40:27,889 --> 01:40:34,055
Mentally,
you're 27 which makes me older.

1089
01:40:37,265 --> 01:40:40,098
Have you read my books?

1090
01:40:41,536 --> 01:40:43,663
I don't read novels.

1091
01:40:46,107 --> 01:40:48,507
But I read yours.

1092
01:40:48,776 --> 01:40:51,006
Very interesting.

1093
01:40:53,548 --> 01:40:55,743
I drank for the first time in 27 years.

1094
01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:59,478
Memories came abruptly.

1095
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:05,681
Memories of not belonging anywhere.
I drank and talked.

1096
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:07,459
Strange.

1097
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:11,824
I am doing the same things,
but people look at me differently.

1098
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:18,399
I'm acting as I did at 27,
but at 54.

1099
01:41:19,173 --> 01:41:22,006
no one thinks I'm foolish.

1100
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:35,634
The age difference between
Yoko Ono and John Lennon?

1101
01:43:37,311 --> 01:43:40,041
Funny!

1102
01:43:40,414 --> 01:43:42,746
Recognize me?

1103
01:43:43,684 --> 01:43:46,175
Have you met Sunghwan?

1104
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:49,082
No.

1105
01:43:51,092 --> 01:43:53,993
I thought that'd be
the first thing you'd do.

1106
01:43:58,699 --> 01:43:59,757
Excuse me.

1107
01:44:20,888 --> 01:44:23,049
You must've been good-looking.

1108
01:44:24,625 --> 01:44:28,083
Not a big shot,
but such a player.

1109
01:44:28,429 --> 01:44:30,522
I had nothing to lose.

1110
01:44:30,631 --> 01:44:32,792
I used to hit on any girls.

1111
01:44:35,736 --> 01:44:41,038
I like older men,
hate rookies.

1112
01:44:41,976 --> 01:44:45,275
I stopped aging at 27.

1113
01:44:47,148 --> 01:44:49,241
This place is still there?

1114
01:44:51,185 --> 01:44:53,050
It was taken last spring.

1115
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:56,653
Good to see some things
stayed the same.

1116
01:44:58,526 --> 01:45:04,692
I kissed a famous writer there.

1117
01:45:05,933 --> 01:45:07,696
If you were a player back then,

1118
01:45:07,902 --> 01:45:11,736
I can imagine what's it
like for you now.

1119
01:45:13,974 --> 01:45:16,204
She was just 20.

1120
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:18,778
Heard of her?

1121
01:45:19,947 --> 01:45:22,347
She was good.

1122
01:45:22,716 --> 01:45:27,016
She thought she was a genius.

1123
01:45:28,622 --> 01:45:31,352
I don't know why I was
drawn to someone like her.

1124
01:45:32,259 --> 01:45:35,786
It's natural.

1125
01:45:36,630 --> 01:45:40,293
To me you're a genius.

1126
01:46:16,770 --> 01:46:17,930
Hello?

1127
01:46:18,572 --> 01:46:22,030
Sorry to wake you up.

1128
01:46:22,309 --> 01:46:26,143
You said I could call you
if I had a question.

1129
01:46:27,648 --> 01:46:28,808
What is it?

1130
01:46:29,650 --> 01:46:35,145
Is it true Jungsuk Kim's
the model for "Avian Kind"?

1131
01:46:35,422 --> 01:46:39,159
Did you intend to overlap
characters in "Whispers in Ears"

1132
01:46:39,159 --> 01:46:43,220
and "the Potion of
a Thousand Years"?

1133
01:46:43,464 --> 01:46:48,669
Did you know you'd come back

1134
01:46:48,669 --> 01:46:52,662
to life like the main character
in "Russian Novel"?

1135
01:46:58,078 --> 01:47:04,677
You know what time it is?

1136
01:47:09,123 --> 01:47:13,025
Oh dear, so many girls
are into old men.

1137
01:47:27,107 --> 01:47:32,909
Did you say the main character of
"Russian Novel" comes back to life?

1138
01:47:34,982 --> 01:47:38,352
They don't let men in
as it's a women's college.

1139
01:47:38,352 --> 01:47:43,790
I had a word with the professor.

1140
01:47:44,191 --> 01:47:48,855
I want to study your writing
at grad school.

1141
01:47:52,967 --> 01:47:55,697
Did I bring the wrong books?

1142
01:47:55,936 --> 01:47:57,995
I brought everything
including first editions.

1143
01:48:04,378 --> 01:48:06,710
Can you help me?

1144
01:48:12,553 --> 01:48:18,150
As I said, I may not seem it,
but I'm so honored.

1145
01:48:18,492 --> 01:48:23,623
If I can help you in any way,
I'd love to.

1146
01:48:24,198 --> 01:48:31,695
I want to learn more
about your works.

1147
01:48:32,373 --> 01:48:34,341
O.K.

1148
01:48:35,142 --> 01:48:37,711
Have you heard
of author Kyungmi Lee?

1149
01:48:37,711 --> 01:48:39,406
Yes.

1150
01:48:41,081 --> 01:48:42,810
How about Mr. Gijin Kim?

1151
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:47,016
He's famous, but
I'm not into his writing.

1152
01:48:57,197 --> 01:48:58,755
I was about to call you.

1153
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:01,266
Did you tamper with my book?

1154
01:49:01,535 --> 01:49:03,935
What are you saying?

1155
01:49:04,204 --> 01:49:07,264
Did you tamper
with my manuscripts?

1156
01:49:07,941 --> 01:49:10,933
Why would I?

1157
01:49:11,612 --> 01:49:13,273
Didn't you rewrite it?

1158
01:49:15,616 --> 01:49:18,585
You didn't do anything?

1159
01:49:20,521 --> 01:49:21,818
Anyway...

1160
01:49:26,894 --> 01:49:29,385
These pictures look good.

1161
01:49:29,797 --> 01:49:38,728
We can add pictures of the settings
and stories about them.

1162
01:49:38,839 --> 01:49:41,307
You said it'd be a few pictures.

1163
01:49:41,542 --> 01:49:49,677
It can be about memories with
Gijin Kim at Wuyeonje.

1164
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:53,777
Stories from your past.

1165
01:49:54,221 --> 01:49:56,121
I think it would be great.

1166
01:49:56,924 --> 01:50:00,461
I was never an official
writer at 'Wuyeonje'.

1167
01:50:00,461 --> 01:50:03,055
I only met Mr. Kim once.

1168
01:50:03,730 --> 01:50:05,925
That's not important.

1169
01:50:06,033 --> 01:50:07,830
You did work there.

1170
01:50:08,836 --> 01:50:11,238
People are interested now

1171
01:50:11,238 --> 01:50:13,707
but who knows what'll
happen in the future.

1172
01:50:13,707 --> 01:50:16,972
We have to rake in as much
as possible while we can.

1173
01:50:17,544 --> 01:50:22,345
Always thinking
of ways to sell me out.

1174
01:50:23,717 --> 01:50:26,379
The 21 st century is
all about business.

1175
01:50:27,821 --> 01:50:30,847
You know art
and I know business.

1176
01:50:30,958 --> 01:50:34,416
Business is this big
and art this little.

1177
01:50:37,831 --> 01:50:41,130
She last published in 1994.

1178
01:50:41,435 --> 01:50:43,494
She immigrated to New Zealand.

1179
01:50:45,072 --> 01:50:49,009
Except for the article for
the Women Writers' Society,

1180
01:50:49,009 --> 01:50:50,670
there is no more.

1181
01:50:51,445 --> 01:50:57,042
My prof heard she's
in another country.

1182
01:50:58,185 --> 01:51:04,556
1994 is when "Avian Kind"
was first published.

1183
01:51:04,992 --> 01:51:07,961
I had trouble
finding her last work.

1184
01:51:08,228 --> 01:51:10,287
The library didn't have it.

1185
01:51:11,465 --> 01:51:14,366
I hunted it out
at a used book store.

1186
01:51:15,602 --> 01:51:19,773
I'd given up
if school doesn't have it

1187
01:51:19,773 --> 01:51:21,934
but as I said,

1188
01:51:22,843 --> 01:51:25,437
it's is such an honor.

1189
01:51:26,213 --> 01:51:28,977
Stop saying that.

1190
01:51:30,984 --> 01:51:31,951
O.K.

1191
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:35,855
Kyungmi was well-received
even after that.

1192
01:51:36,990 --> 01:51:40,551
So why suddenly immigrate?

1193
01:51:41,795 --> 01:51:47,597
Jungsuk Kim was found by
at a fishing pond in 1998.

1194
01:51:48,368 --> 01:51:54,307
No one knows if it was
an accident or suicide.

1195
01:51:56,109 --> 01:52:00,102
It's either Kyungmi or Jungsuk,

1196
01:52:01,114 --> 01:52:02,950
I thought.

1197
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:08,354
The only ones talented
enough to tamper with mine.

1198
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:23,030
We think life is ours.

1199
01:52:23,470 --> 01:52:25,495
With some time,

1200
01:52:25,572 --> 01:52:30,032
we realize we're only a part of
the big river called life.

1201
01:52:31,612 --> 01:52:33,477
It flows through us,

1202
01:52:33,547 --> 01:52:35,782
but water becomes a stream
and streams to a river,

1203
01:52:35,782 --> 01:52:37,374
and finally the sea.

1204
01:52:37,784 --> 01:52:39,809
Life doesn't belong to us.

1205
01:52:43,624 --> 01:52:48,891
When the miracle you've longed
for finally happens,

1206
01:52:49,229 --> 01:52:52,289
your sincerity may be faded.

1207
01:52:52,432 --> 01:52:54,332
Would I have made
the same choice,

1208
01:52:55,636 --> 01:53:00,130
if I'd known what'd happen?

1209
01:53:01,742 --> 01:53:07,009
Kyungmi immigrated in the year
my first novel was published.

1210
01:53:07,114 --> 01:53:10,140
I thought it was her at first.

1211
01:53:10,651 --> 01:53:16,146
She knows me well
and writes well.

1212
01:53:17,724 --> 01:53:20,955
But the more I thought about it,

1213
01:53:21,061 --> 01:53:23,859
the more convinced
I became it wasn't her.

1214
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:26,998
Definitely,

1215
01:53:27,668 --> 01:53:31,798
this is not my work.

1216
01:53:38,045 --> 01:53:39,876
Why didn't you call me first?

1217
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:43,909
You haven't changed even
after such an experience.

1218
01:53:49,790 --> 01:53:51,451
She's my girlfriend.

1219
01:53:51,558 --> 01:53:52,786
Don't peep at her.

1220
01:53:52,993 --> 01:53:56,429
You sure know
how to get Seoul chicks.

1221
01:53:57,297 --> 01:53:59,697
I hit on him, actually.

1222
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:04,496
I'm mentally in my 20s,
so I can date her.

1223
01:54:05,339 --> 01:54:08,831
I wish I could be like you.

1224
01:54:17,084 --> 01:54:24,422
Remember the girl who came
when I was writing?

1225
01:54:25,425 --> 01:54:26,585
Yes,

1226
01:54:27,627 --> 01:54:29,618
she went to all
that trouble for you.

1227
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:33,158
What happened to the scripts
she gave you?

1228
01:54:33,266 --> 01:54:34,927
Did you have them?

1229
01:54:35,035 --> 01:54:35,831
No.

1230
01:54:36,036 --> 01:54:37,628
I wasn't interested.

1231
01:54:37,904 --> 01:54:39,633
Wouldn't have understood it anyway.

1232
01:54:45,145 --> 01:54:46,077
Hello?

1233
01:54:46,446 --> 01:54:49,415
I searched all night.

1234
01:54:49,816 --> 01:54:53,149
Nothing new on Kyungmi

1235
01:54:54,388 --> 01:54:59,985
but lots on Jungsuk's accident.

1236
01:55:01,361 --> 01:55:05,457
I don't remember it well,
cuz I was little.

1237
01:55:05,565 --> 01:55:08,432
Many memorial services.

1238
01:55:09,703 --> 01:55:11,432
He has a daughter.

1239
01:55:11,938 --> 01:55:18,537
Head of a memorial committee.

1240
01:55:18,945 --> 01:55:21,004
Does this help?

1241
01:55:21,615 --> 01:55:24,812
I know you hate it when I say this

1242
01:55:24,951 --> 01:55:29,820
but I'm honored to work for you.

1243
01:55:30,257 --> 01:55:36,560
If you can possibly tell
my professor about what I've done...

1244
01:55:37,964 --> 01:55:39,932
Do I sound weird?

1245
01:55:40,467 --> 01:55:41,661
No.

1246
01:55:42,769 --> 01:55:46,432
I'd be thankful if you can...

1247
01:55:47,507 --> 01:55:50,374
You don't have to but...

1248
01:55:54,347 --> 01:55:55,541
Hello?

1249
01:56:21,274 --> 01:56:22,764
Surprised to hear from me?

1250
01:56:25,111 --> 01:56:27,477
You're a celebrity, so yes.

1251
01:56:29,382 --> 01:56:31,680
I found your number easily.

1252
01:56:31,785 --> 01:56:34,219
Guess it's one of
the perks of being famous.

1253
01:56:34,721 --> 01:56:38,953
I wondered why you contacted me.

1254
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:44,897
It feels like yesterday.

1255
01:56:45,832 --> 01:56:49,268
You told me
a lot about my writing.

1256
01:56:49,469 --> 01:56:52,529
It helped me a lot.

1257
01:56:54,574 --> 01:56:57,566
Well, let me see...

1258
01:57:01,214 --> 01:57:04,012
I remember you were interesting

1259
01:57:05,252 --> 01:57:07,186
and close to Sunghwan.

1260
01:57:07,454 --> 01:57:08,716
That's all.

1261
01:57:09,789 --> 01:57:12,257
What did I say?

1262
01:57:15,195 --> 01:57:16,958
You don't remember?

1263
01:57:18,565 --> 01:57:19,862
You...

1264
01:57:21,334 --> 01:57:24,497
made such
a difference in my life!

1265
01:57:25,338 --> 01:57:30,708
How can you not remember?

1266
01:57:31,177 --> 01:57:44,215
I even thought you were
greater than your father.

1267
01:57:46,192 --> 01:57:47,454
Really?

1268
01:57:50,530 --> 01:57:51,758
Never mind.

1269
01:57:51,898 --> 01:57:55,561
Pointless to discuss it now.

1270
01:57:58,738 --> 01:58:04,176
You and Sunghwan were so alike.

1271
01:58:04,911 --> 01:58:06,003
Really?

1272
01:58:06,913 --> 01:58:11,509
Both long and complex...

1273
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:16,211
like Russian novels.

1274
01:58:21,561 --> 01:58:27,796
I realize how fear drives me
away from life.

1275
01:58:29,002 --> 01:58:31,630
I was trying to avoid a small fear.

1276
01:58:31,738 --> 01:58:36,107
Now it's become huge.

1277
01:58:46,886 --> 01:58:51,448
Who tampered with my works?

1278
01:58:52,692 --> 01:58:54,785
After all these years,

1279
01:58:55,095 --> 01:58:56,653
if I find out who,
will anything change?

1280
01:59:01,935 --> 01:59:06,338
Did you write them on your own?

1281
01:59:09,976 --> 01:59:11,011
Just...

1282
01:59:11,011 --> 01:59:14,037
it doesn't seem like it was
written by one person.

1283
02:00:06,966 --> 02:00:08,263
Hey.

1284
02:00:08,668 --> 02:00:09,726
Yes?

1285
02:00:11,071 --> 02:00:17,306
What you said in class.
Tell me more.

1286
02:00:18,645 --> 02:00:21,546
You'd know about it
better than me.

1287
02:00:24,451 --> 02:00:27,079
I'm asking your opinion.

1288
02:00:29,823 --> 02:00:31,723
I'm a bit disappointed.

1289
02:00:31,858 --> 02:00:34,053
I had big expectations
before I saw you.

1290
02:00:41,101 --> 02:00:42,261
Hello?

1291
02:00:51,678 --> 02:00:52,838
Sorry.

1292
02:00:53,513 --> 02:00:55,708
Had to get the kids ready
for cram school.

1293
02:00:56,282 --> 02:00:57,943
No worries.
I have lots of time.

1294
02:00:58,084 --> 02:00:59,719
Life keeps me busy.

1295
02:00:59,719 --> 02:01:01,550
I forget things.

1296
02:01:03,957 --> 02:01:08,519
But I think I remember
what happened.

1297
02:01:10,463 --> 02:01:15,833
Only Sunghwan knew
I stopped going to school.

1298
02:01:17,804 --> 02:01:20,473
He said I should go.

1299
02:01:20,473 --> 02:01:27,174
He tried to teach me useful things.

1300
02:01:27,714 --> 02:01:32,151
You really don't want to
become a writer?

1301
02:01:34,988 --> 02:01:37,690
If I asked a question,

1302
02:01:37,690 --> 02:01:39,783
he tried to find the answer for me.

1303
02:01:39,893 --> 02:01:44,125
He was stuffy like that.

1304
02:01:45,465 --> 02:01:48,400
I liked your writing.

1305
02:01:49,202 --> 02:01:53,161
I asked Sunghwan,

1306
02:01:54,207 --> 02:01:59,042
if you can be a novelist
like my dad.

1307
02:01:59,345 --> 02:02:05,113
It was a simple question.
You two were friends.

1308
02:02:05,418 --> 02:02:08,478
He's quite serious.

1309
02:02:09,689 --> 02:02:14,626
He pondered and started to talk.

1310
02:02:15,361 --> 02:02:16,692
What did he say?

1311
02:02:17,197 --> 02:02:18,858
Things I told you.

1312
02:02:20,967 --> 02:02:22,798
I don't remember much.

1313
02:02:23,803 --> 02:02:27,034
I was just rambling on.

1314
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:31,370
So what you said
at the bus stop...

1315
02:02:32,846 --> 02:02:37,545
They weren't my ideas but
what Sunghwan said.

1316
02:02:43,857 --> 02:02:44,846
Why?

1317
02:02:45,692 --> 02:02:49,059
Why did you tell me that?

1318
02:02:51,831 --> 02:02:53,389
Didn't you know?

1319
02:02:56,169 --> 02:02:59,468
I had a crush on Sunghwan.

1320
02:03:01,674 --> 02:03:06,134
I thought it's
what he wanted to tell you.

1321
02:03:07,647 --> 02:03:09,046
You know him.

1322
02:03:10,049 --> 02:03:13,951
He didn't know how to
say important things.

1323
02:03:16,489 --> 02:03:18,650
He's a complex maze

1324
02:03:18,758 --> 02:03:20,350
many characters,

1325
02:03:20,593 --> 02:03:21,992
long lines,

1326
02:03:27,066 --> 02:03:29,660
like a Russian novel.

1327
02:03:33,206 --> 02:03:36,175
My busy schedule
was just an excuse.

1328
02:03:36,342 --> 02:03:40,745
I wasn't intending to
find Sunghwan.

1329
02:03:42,482 --> 02:03:44,916
Excuse me.

1330
02:03:46,119 --> 02:03:47,279
Yes?

1331
02:03:47,854 --> 02:03:52,689
Do you happen to know
Sunghwan Kim?

1332
02:03:54,294 --> 02:03:55,886
Why do you ask?

1333
02:03:57,363 --> 02:04:01,060
He's a friend of mine.

1334
02:04:02,168 --> 02:04:05,296
He's not here.

1335
02:04:07,941 --> 02:04:15,211
Things didn't work out for him.

1336
02:04:16,816 --> 02:04:20,308
He was swindled
and lost everything.

1337
02:04:22,021 --> 02:04:26,117
Loan sharks threatened
to kill him.

1338
02:04:28,294 --> 02:04:32,697
Don't know what he's up to.

1339
02:04:34,267 --> 02:04:41,639
He worked here for a bit
but not now.

1340
02:04:43,409 --> 02:04:47,937
He lost everything?

1341
02:04:49,782 --> 02:04:51,682
Right.

1342
02:04:53,886 --> 02:04:57,822
Still, he's the son of
the great Gijin Kim.

1343
02:04:59,058 --> 02:05:01,253
Some say he's in his hometown.

1344
02:05:06,065 --> 02:05:07,800
What are you doing here?

1345
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:09,529
Think of it as a coincidence.

1346
02:05:09,635 --> 02:05:12,069
Can't you be more respectful?

1347
02:05:12,271 --> 02:05:14,239
I'm disappointed.

1348
02:05:14,741 --> 02:05:15,708
What?

1349
02:05:16,242 --> 02:05:18,437
How dare you be so rude?

1350
02:05:18,845 --> 02:05:21,541
Think everything should be
laid out for you?

1351
02:05:23,216 --> 02:05:24,478
Stop!

1352
02:05:24,717 --> 02:05:26,241
Who the hell are you?

1353
02:05:26,786 --> 02:05:29,277
I'm also here to find something.

1354
02:05:29,622 --> 02:05:30,850
What?

1355
02:05:30,990 --> 02:05:34,653
What do you know about me?

1356
02:05:35,995 --> 02:05:38,725
You're here for Mr. Sunghwan Kim?

1357
02:05:38,831 --> 02:05:40,093
Me too.

1358
02:05:44,370 --> 02:05:47,828
If you see him, tell me.
I'll do the same.

1359
02:05:49,042 --> 02:05:50,737
He went to Damyang.

1360
02:05:50,910 --> 02:05:52,207
Why are you looking for him?

1361
02:05:53,012 --> 02:05:54,604
Where's Damyang?

1362
02:05:55,615 --> 02:05:58,516
Aren't you going to
tell me anything?

1363
02:05:59,352 --> 02:06:00,284
Depends.

1364
02:06:12,398 --> 02:06:15,731
This isn't for fun,
you know.

1365
02:06:36,222 --> 02:06:37,712
He must be keeping

1366
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:45,322
a low-profile as he lost everything.

1367
02:07:03,883 --> 02:07:06,443
Aren't you going to
tell me the truth?

1368
02:07:06,552 --> 02:07:07,576
What?

1369
02:07:08,254 --> 02:07:10,848
Why you're looking for him?

1370
02:07:11,791 --> 02:07:13,224
Take a guess.

1371
02:07:14,594 --> 02:07:15,828
I like her.

1372
02:07:15,828 --> 02:07:17,056
She's my style.

1373
02:07:17,797 --> 02:07:20,595
You aren't his daughter, are you?

1374
02:07:21,267 --> 02:07:24,259
A novelist with such a poor
sense of imagination.

1375
02:07:24,971 --> 02:07:28,634
Should've known better than to ask.

1376
02:07:28,808 --> 02:07:30,276
Awesome.

1377
02:07:30,276 --> 02:07:32,437
What's your major?

1378
02:07:33,112 --> 02:07:34,447
I'm in high school.

1379
02:07:34,447 --> 02:07:35,209
What?

1380
02:07:35,715 --> 02:07:36,613
What?

1381
02:07:38,551 --> 02:07:40,576
Why didn't you tell me?

1382
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:42,244
You never asked.

1383
02:07:44,924 --> 02:07:49,554
Tell me
why you want to meet him.

1384
02:07:49,929 --> 02:07:52,124
I have something for him.
From my mom.

1385
02:07:52,265 --> 02:07:53,289
Mom?

1386
02:07:53,733 --> 02:07:54,995
Who's your mom?

1387
02:07:57,036 --> 02:07:58,264
Play your game right.

1388
02:07:59,138 --> 02:08:01,106
I love her style!

1389
02:08:29,135 --> 02:08:32,571
Why are you seeing
such an old man?

1390
02:08:32,905 --> 02:08:36,204
I know.
Call me a crazy bitch.

1391
02:08:39,278 --> 02:08:44,910
Wuyeonje had become a village center
after 3 different owners.

1392
02:08:45,818 --> 02:08:52,815
I don't want to stay at other places,
though here's no memory left.

1393
02:08:54,393 --> 02:09:02,698
And old memories are still
in my mind after 27 years.

1394
02:09:33,466 --> 02:09:35,457
There's a strange hut.

1395
02:09:39,472 --> 02:09:41,906
You never read my novels, huh?

1396
02:09:46,078 --> 02:09:48,103
Although I came to find him,

1397
02:09:48,214 --> 02:09:50,182
I wasn't in a hurry.

1398
02:09:50,883 --> 02:09:52,783
He was somewhere

1399
02:09:53,052 --> 02:09:57,955
and I knew we'd end up meeting.

1400
02:09:58,424 --> 02:10:04,260
The rewriter had to be him.

1401
02:10:05,064 --> 02:10:09,091
It was done just
as Garim had said.

1402
02:10:10,569 --> 02:10:14,869
It was a cold wintry night,
perfect for reminiscing.

1403
02:10:16,242 --> 02:10:19,939
If he rewrote it,

1404
02:10:20,780 --> 02:10:23,374
why didn't he claim as his own?

1405
02:10:23,916 --> 02:10:26,652
It was almost a new creation.

1406
02:10:26,652 --> 02:10:29,519
With his skills,

1407
02:10:29,655 --> 02:10:32,988
why didn't he become
a writer like his dad?

1408
02:10:42,601 --> 02:10:46,401
Why is it called
"the Russian Novel"?

1409
02:10:47,740 --> 02:10:49,708
I didn't give name the book.

1410
02:10:50,609 --> 02:10:53,737
Why do you think
it's called that?

1411
02:10:56,515 --> 02:10:59,109
I doubt we'll find him.

1412
02:10:59,518 --> 02:11:02,783
You find him
and give it to him.

1413
02:11:03,556 --> 02:11:04,989
Too cold.

1414
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:29,470
They're from my mom to him

1415
02:11:32,585 --> 02:11:37,181
and these from Sunghwan to her.

1416
02:11:38,357 --> 02:11:43,351
This is what she asked me
to give Sunghwan.

1417
02:11:44,830 --> 02:11:49,164
This is what she asked me
to give you.

1418
02:11:49,435 --> 02:11:51,596
Why didn't she give it
to me in person?

1419
02:11:54,106 --> 02:11:56,199
Who's your mom?

1420
02:11:57,510 --> 02:12:00,035
Do I remind of anybody?

1421
02:12:02,848 --> 02:12:04,281
Oh, my.

1422
02:12:04,383 --> 02:12:06,248
How old did you say you are?

1423
02:12:07,186 --> 02:12:08,921
Don't worry.

1424
02:12:08,921 --> 02:12:11,947
I'm not your daughter.

1425
02:12:12,291 --> 02:12:13,626
Right.

1426
02:12:13,626 --> 02:12:15,116
Can't be.

1427
02:12:19,131 --> 02:12:22,862
My mom's Jehye Lee.

1428
02:12:42,688 --> 02:12:46,089
The more you try to avoid fear,
the bigger it gets.

1429
02:12:50,563 --> 02:12:56,365
Your awakening was
something I always wanted.

1430
02:12:57,636 --> 02:13:01,037
But I didn't have the courage.

1431
02:13:01,273 --> 02:13:05,869
Perhaps you thought
I died with you back then.

1432
02:13:10,549 --> 02:13:15,816
I kept thinking you aren't mine.

1433
02:13:16,188 --> 02:13:18,156
It wasn't easy.

1434
02:13:19,358 --> 02:13:24,421
I wanted you to be free,
to be appreciated.

1435
02:13:25,364 --> 02:13:29,164
But I knew you'd leave.

1436
02:13:31,003 --> 02:13:41,937
Still, I did what I did
thanks to my youth.

1437
02:13:43,682 --> 02:13:47,812
I thought you died that night.

1438
02:13:48,153 --> 02:13:54,456
I was anguished and guilt-ridden.

1439
02:13:54,727 --> 02:13:59,255
I wanted your work to
be re-evaluated.

1440
02:13:59,798 --> 02:14:01,698
I couldn't do it,

1441
02:14:02,101 --> 02:14:04,934
- so I turned to Sunghwan.
- It's strangely beautiful.

1442
02:14:06,505 --> 02:14:11,772
But story itself
isn't easy to follow.

1443
02:14:15,915 --> 02:14:19,214
There's a fatal weakness.

1444
02:14:24,390 --> 02:14:27,689
Help him please.

1445
02:14:29,428 --> 02:14:30,554
What?

1446
02:14:31,730 --> 02:14:33,857
I want you to re-write it.

1447
02:14:35,467 --> 02:14:40,427
Did he ask you to do this?

1448
02:14:44,877 --> 02:14:46,242
He's...

1449
02:14:49,315 --> 02:14:50,748
dead.

1450
02:14:54,620 --> 02:14:58,488
I think I killed him.

1451
02:15:06,732 --> 02:15:09,701
As I rewrote it,

1452
02:15:10,269 --> 02:15:13,796
I realized neither
of us could be a writer.

1453
02:15:14,173 --> 02:15:15,507
Unlike him,

1454
02:15:15,507 --> 02:15:23,471
I didn't have the reckless desire
to shout to the world.

1455
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:28,750
I realized it as I was writing
under someone else's name.

1456
02:15:30,422 --> 02:15:35,883
The new version is different.

1457
02:15:37,429 --> 02:15:40,125
I don't know
how this could happen.

1458
02:15:41,133 --> 02:15:47,368
If I publish it,
I could be greater than my father.

1459
02:15:48,941 --> 02:15:52,570
Of course, I could never
recreate this again.

1460
02:15:56,215 --> 02:15:58,183
Hard to believe

1461
02:15:58,384 --> 02:16:03,083
but it took 10 years
for him to do it.

1462
02:16:03,622 --> 02:16:10,528
Can you imagine
what happened to him?

1463
02:16:12,164 --> 02:16:18,103
I feel guiltier towards
him than to you.

1464
02:16:18,437 --> 02:16:24,535
I don't have the courage to
see you two.

1465
02:16:26,712 --> 02:16:30,944
Give my letter to Sunghwan.

1466
02:16:31,216 --> 02:16:35,880
I've lived in Shanghai
for 20 years.

1467
02:16:36,789 --> 02:16:39,155
Even if I have
the courage to see you,

1468
02:16:39,358 --> 02:16:41,826
I'm too sick to travel.

1469
02:16:42,995 --> 02:16:47,694
If you'd woken earlier,
it may have been possible.

1470
02:16:48,033 --> 02:16:52,993
But miracles happen at
the most opportune time.

1471
02:17:06,518 --> 02:17:08,213
Is it the title?

1472
02:17:08,687 --> 02:17:10,314
The Russian Novel?

1473
02:17:10,723 --> 02:17:11,747
Yep.

1474
02:17:13,325 --> 02:17:15,020
Why?

1475
02:17:17,262 --> 02:17:18,593
It's long,

1476
02:17:18,997 --> 02:17:20,760
complicated

1477
02:17:22,735 --> 02:17:24,669
with many characters.

1478
02:17:29,408 --> 02:17:35,745
A fisherman was
fishing all night long.

1479
02:17:38,383 --> 02:17:45,846
He kept catching and
releasing the fish all night.

1480
02:17:47,693 --> 02:17:51,288
A fisherman was
fishing all night long.

1481
02:17:52,464 --> 02:17:55,234
Sinhyo walked to the pond asked,

1482
02:17:55,234 --> 02:17:58,135
why he was releasing
the fish he caught.

1483
02:17:59,471 --> 02:18:01,939
The fisherman said,

1484
02:18:02,641 --> 02:18:07,874
"I'm looking for the damn fish
almost caught yesterday."

1485
02:18:27,900 --> 02:18:30,536
When he passes me,
I cannot see him;

1486
02:18:30,536 --> 02:18:33,338
when he goes by,
I cannot perceive him. (Job 8:14)

1487
02:18:33,338 --> 02:18:35,067
- from Go the to his son
