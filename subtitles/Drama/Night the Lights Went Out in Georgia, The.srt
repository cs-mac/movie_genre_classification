1
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,428
A couple guys came to me,
and they gave me a proposition.

2
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,542
They come by with a car, and
I break it down to its component parts.

3
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:18,367
A chop shop.
How much money we talking about?

4
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:20,970
You'll make more money in two months
than you could in two years.

5
00:00:21,138 --> 00:00:22,678
- Who's that?
- That's Ryan.

6
00:00:22,803 --> 00:00:24,640
Is there something
you wanna tell me about?

7
00:00:24,864 --> 00:00:27,043
I will say that I feel a lot better.

8
00:00:27,246 --> 00:00:29,078
Look, I've got some bad news.

9
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:31,280
I'm pregnant, and it's yours.

10
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,215
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

11
00:00:33,383 --> 00:00:35,818
And I'm so scared.

12
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:37,251
Come here.

13
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,558
I am filled

14
00:00:43,214 --> 00:00:46,614
with pride and love as I look out
over this congregation.

15
00:00:47,065 --> 00:00:50,566
And there is our own star
on the football field, Luke Cafferty.

16
00:00:57,005 --> 00:01:00,305
Thank you, Luke, for making
your congregation so proud.

17
00:01:02,723 --> 00:01:03,823
Let us pray.

18
00:01:05,426 --> 00:01:07,294
Our father who art in Heaven...

19
00:01:08,062 --> 00:01:09,612
Hallowed be thy name,

20
00:01:10,197 --> 00:01:12,822
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...

21
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:30,342
Well, awesome.

22
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:33,441
I believe this belongs to you, sir.

23
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:36,212
Appreciate it again, huh?
I'll see you soon.

24
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,514
I can't take any more
of these skeletons.

25
00:01:40,806 --> 00:01:42,785
- What do you mean? Why not?
- You can guess.

26
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,021
I ain't asked any questions about
where you been getting these car frames,

27
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,724
but I ain't real interested in the cops
surprising me either.

28
00:01:49,116 --> 00:01:51,073
You keep showing up
with these stripped cars,

29
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:52,494
they're gonna show up too.

30
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:55,297
All right.

31
00:01:55,669 --> 00:01:57,443
- Sorry.
- Yeah, don't be.

32
00:01:57,612 --> 00:01:58,612
Thank you.

33
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:05,641
Let the tight end clear.
Slot receiver crosses underneath...

34
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:08,744
you hold. You hit the third receiver,
he's gonna be running the delay.

35
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:10,879
So that third receiver's
taking too long,

36
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,848
- and the defense is in my face...
- Listen!

37
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:15,918
You let the tight end clear.
Slot receiver crosses underneath,

38
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:17,653
you hold.

39
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,823
You hit the third receiver.
He's running a delay.

40
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,000
Can you see that?

41
00:02:24,594 --> 00:02:25,923
- You can see that?
- I can.

42
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:27,426
- You can see it?
- Yes, sir.

43
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:29,264
- You understand that?
- I gotta go,

44
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:32,782
'cause Mr. Merriweather's not
a happy man when I'm late.

45
00:02:33,962 --> 00:02:35,871
I want you to know
this stuff sooner than later.

46
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,005
Yes, sir.

47
00:02:38,355 --> 00:02:40,577
- How you doing, Coach?
- I'm doing good. How are you?

48
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,512
- How's the kid doing?
- Showing up on time, doing the work.

49
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,736
So I see you're doing a delay drag.

50
00:02:45,886 --> 00:02:47,749
You're gonna start putting in
timing patterns.

51
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:49,811
Thinking about it, yeah.

52
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,659
Looking forward to the game.

53
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:02,097
What was that supposed to mean?

54
00:03:03,112 --> 00:03:04,312
How you doing?

55
00:03:06,456 --> 00:03:08,937
Well, I woke up this morning,
and I'm still pregnant, so...

56
00:03:09,465 --> 00:03:10,765
had better days.

57
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:15,110
Kind of puts that B-minus I got
in geography into perspective.

58
00:03:15,619 --> 00:03:17,168
Talked to your mom yet?

59
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,317
- I don't know what I'm gonna do.
- You need to talk to your mom.

60
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,306
Why?

61
00:03:32,827 --> 00:03:34,227
She'll understand.

62
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,620
You don't know her.

63
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:45,961
Come on.

64
00:03:46,564 --> 00:03:48,467
- Where are we going?
- Give me your hand.

65
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:49,592
Trust me.

66
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,690
Let's go.

67
00:03:56,085 --> 00:03:58,109
- Hey, Tim. How are you?
- Hi, Mrs. Taylor.

68
00:03:58,268 --> 00:04:00,123
- Good.
- Sorry, Coach isn't here right now,

69
00:04:00,248 --> 00:04:02,160
but he should be back
in a couple hours or so.

70
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:03,759
I'm actually here to talk to you.

71
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:06,094
Okay. Everything all right?

72
00:04:06,592 --> 00:04:07,896
I need your help.

73
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:12,407
- Come on in.
- It's actually for a friend of mine.

74
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:21,969
Have y'all talked
about your options at all?

75
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:24,513
- Oh, Tim's not the father.
- We're just friends.

76
00:04:28,683 --> 00:04:31,820
Tim, I think it would be a good idea
for you to wait outside for a moment,

77
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:33,488
give Becky and I some privacy.

78
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,490
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

79
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,230
I'll be outside.

80
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:45,576
Have you told your parents?

81
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:46,616
No.

82
00:04:50,353 --> 00:04:53,775
Do you think it would put you in
any kind of harm, any kind of physical

83
00:04:53,943 --> 00:04:55,941
or emotional harm,
if you were to tell them?

84
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:56,804
No.

85
00:04:57,981 --> 00:04:59,198
It's just me and my mom.

86
00:04:59,323 --> 00:05:01,689
I just haven't been able
to tell her yet.

87
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,874
Well, I think my first suggestion
is gonna be

88
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,822
for you to try to find a way
to tell her

89
00:05:08,116 --> 00:05:11,121
as soon as you can.
I think that's gonna be real important.

90
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,157
Does the father know?

91
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:20,199
Yeah, he does, but...

92
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:23,128
I barely know him,

93
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:26,372
and I don't love him
or anything. And...

94
00:05:28,637 --> 00:05:30,579
It's just like this whole thing
is a bad dream...

95
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:34,155
- I understand.
- I just keep wanting it to go away.

96
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:38,786
What should I do?

97
00:05:41,427 --> 00:05:43,224
You have free medical assistance

98
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:45,153
available to you
throughout your pregnancy.

99
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,229
There's a teen clinic. They're real
helpful and knowledgeable there.

100
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:52,545
I can refer you
to the adoption agency.

101
00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:56,561
- That's local here.
- What if I don't...

102
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,940
What if I don't want
to have the baby?

103
00:06:01,113 --> 00:06:03,163
I can direct you to literature...

104
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,529
for that.

105
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,237
4x10: I CAN'T

106

Benj!, Collioure, DarKsh,
GillesSilb, Mpm, Ouazo

108
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:01,703
Let's go now, 5.
Good splits now. Come off the ball.

109
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,418
Vince, come here.

110
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:10,478
Bring it in!

111
00:07:11,135 --> 00:07:13,014
You're gonna want
to rush this play... Don't.

112
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,450
- Let the receivers clear.
- What about the offensive line?

113
00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:16,684
They're not blocking.

114
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:19,721
Why don't you just worry about the lanes
and worry about your job... How's that?

115
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:21,522
Come on, now, son.
Let's go.

116
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:25,159
You got this, 5.
Call it.

117
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:27,829
These guys got to get it together.
I mean, this is...

118
00:07:32,323 --> 00:07:33,635
Oh, man.

119
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,671
That boy couldn't get a bull
with a ball on the field today.

120
00:07:44,402 --> 00:07:46,496
He get his feet under him,
he'll be all right.

121
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:50,251
- Big Mary. Look who's here.
- Mary, Mary, quite contrary.

122
00:07:50,376 --> 00:07:51,486
How y'all doing?

123
00:07:51,735 --> 00:07:52,993
What's up, baby?

124
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:55,223
- How's it going out there?
- Not too good, man.

125
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:57,810
Vince would be lucky
to hit water from a boat today.

126
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,494
Pre-snap protection, now.
Come on!

127
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:02,212
- Do it!
- Give him some time. Let's go!

128
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:04,467
That kid can run
like the wind, brother.

129
00:08:04,592 --> 00:08:05,835
Not as fast as Virgil was.

130
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,360
Nobody cut upfield
like you did, boy.

131
00:08:09,084 --> 00:08:11,026
They're not very good, are they?

132
00:08:13,873 --> 00:08:14,942
What is this?

133
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:18,880
I mean, I...
Honestly, I bet I could sue them

134
00:08:19,048 --> 00:08:20,715
for false advertising.
What is this?

135
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:24,422
This is crap. This is not even something
that should go into our bodies...

136
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:25,797
I'm pregnant.

137
00:08:30,954 --> 00:08:32,904
That's not even funny, Becky.

138
00:08:33,123 --> 00:08:34,523
Why would you s...

139
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:51,609
No, you're not.
What...

140
00:09:03,303 --> 00:09:05,303
Damn it!
You're kidding me, right?

141
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:06,928
You're not kidding me?

142
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:09,816
You're telling me right now
that you're pregnant?

143
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,267
You're not!
Damn it, Becky!

144
00:09:20,536 --> 00:09:22,742
- Did she go down all right?
- Yeah, after four books

145
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:24,998
and a few stories,
I had to crawl out of the room again.

146
00:09:25,123 --> 00:09:28,091
- That's what it takes nowadays.
- She's getting smart like that.

147
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:30,951
Don't slam the door.

148
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:33,512
- Is Grace already asleep?
- Yes, you missed her.

149
00:09:33,637 --> 00:09:35,237
And you missed dinner.

150
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:37,776
- I was just busy. Sorry.
- So busy.

151
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:40,961
- Busy? You're always busy.
- Busy, busy all the time.

152
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:44,533
So speaking of being busy,
Wednesday night when we have dinner,

153
00:09:44,658 --> 00:09:46,283
I invited a friend over.

154
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,935
Oh, what kind of a friend?

155
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:50,938
Do you remember that guy Ryan?

156
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:53,450
- He works for Habitat...
- Ryan, I remember Ryan.

157
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:57,360
He's gonna come over. But I gotta
go do homework, and I love you guys.

158
00:09:57,485 --> 00:09:59,380
- Later.
- Love you. Nice talking to you.

159
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:01,115
- Don't wake her up.
- I won't.

160
00:10:01,283 --> 00:10:03,136
- How old is that kid?
- I don't know, honey.

161
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:06,761
That's not gonna last.
I can tell you that. It's a rebound.

162
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:10,977
So one thing
I got to tell you, though.

163
00:10:11,381 --> 00:10:14,662
Tim Riggins came over here today
with a girl from East Dillon high.

164
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:16,607
He came over here?

165
00:10:17,222 --> 00:10:19,567
- What did he come over here for?
- 'Cause she was pregnant.

166
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:23,137
Tim Riggins is gonna be a father?

167
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:26,259
I know. That's what
I thought too, but, no.

168
00:10:26,755 --> 00:10:28,309
No, they said he's not the father.

169
00:10:29,777 --> 00:10:31,530
But it was his girlfriend?

170
00:10:31,655 --> 00:10:33,297
No, I don't think it was.

171
00:10:33,422 --> 00:10:35,665
I don't know.
I think they were friends.

172
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,778
It was very...
it was very strange, honey.

173
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:40,588
Well, wait a second.
Why did he come over here?

174
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:43,731
I don't know
what his involvement is.

175
00:10:43,856 --> 00:10:46,193
I'll tell you one thing, though.
She needed someone to talk to.

176
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:51,323
- Did it go all right?
- I think so.

177
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:55,236
I did what I'm supposed to do.
I told her about some of her options

178
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,155
and told her she should talk
to her parents.

179
00:11:10,843 --> 00:11:11,843
Hey, mom.

180
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,388
I brought you home some barbecue...

181
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,655
Ribs, chicken, greens,

182
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:21,034
'cause I don't eat nothing
compared to you.

183
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:22,740
Mom.

184
00:11:53,014 --> 00:11:56,453
I need an ambulance to 2609 Chavez,
apartment 23.

185
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:19,887
What happened?

186
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:25,157
You O.D'd.

187
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:30,161
You had a little bit too much.

188
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:33,800
The doctor's got you sedated,

189
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,094
and...

190
00:12:41,989 --> 00:12:43,789
You're gonna be just fine.

191
00:12:45,081 --> 00:12:46,547
You're gonna be all right.

192
00:12:47,943 --> 00:12:48,943
Come here.

193
00:12:49,674 --> 00:12:51,324
Give your mother a hug.

194
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:52,303
No, don't.

195
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,833
It's so you won't hurt yourself.

196
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:06,569
Okay.

197
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:17,684
Mom.

198
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:23,447
Why do you keep
doing this to yourself?

199
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:35,617
Why do you keep doing this to me?

200
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,710
I mean, am I that bad?

201
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,950
Why don't you want to be with me?

202
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:50,343
Why do you want
to leave me by myself?

203
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:52,967
Because...

204
00:13:55,076 --> 00:13:56,576
I don't know if I...

205
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,888
I don't know
if I can do it by myself.

206
00:14:03,088 --> 00:14:04,088
Baby...

207
00:14:06,604 --> 00:14:08,557
I can't do it by myself, mom.

208
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,376
- Hey, how you doing?
- Fine. Everything's awesome.

209
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:24,865
Let me.

210
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:26,726
Can we talk, please?

211
00:14:26,851 --> 00:14:27,901
About what?

212
00:14:28,723 --> 00:14:31,504
- You know what I want to talk about.
- You haven't told anyone, have you?

213
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:34,412
'Cause that is seriously
the last thing I need right now.

214
00:14:34,537 --> 00:14:35,737
I didn't. I...

215
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:37,619
I haven't made the appointment yet.

216
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,060
- So just stop hassling me.
- Okay. I'm not hassling you.

217
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:44,067
This is my problem,
and I'm figuring it out on my own.

218
00:14:44,621 --> 00:14:46,833
- So you just need to forget about it.
- I can't.

219
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,916
That's what I'm trying to do.

220
00:14:50,504 --> 00:14:52,230
How's it going?
Did you do your homework?

221
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:53,640
Cool, can I copy it?

222
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,718
So I replaced the timing belt.
That was $110.

223
00:14:58,843 --> 00:15:01,348
I checked all the fluids.
I checked all your hoses.

224
00:15:01,516 --> 00:15:03,498
And just threw
in a free oil change...

225
00:15:03,623 --> 00:15:05,018
What you got going on here?

226
00:15:05,377 --> 00:15:07,153
What are you doing?
Don't touch that!

227
00:15:07,321 --> 00:15:08,803
What are you doing?

228
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:10,457
Chill, man.

229
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:13,860
Fixing cars is delicate, man.
I don't need you touching on things.

230
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:17,130
Relax. He didn't even touch anything.
I was looking at him the whole time.

231
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:20,587
So it's $140 all together.

232
00:15:23,324 --> 00:15:24,324
All set.

233
00:15:25,911 --> 00:15:28,192
Texas law requires that I inform you

234
00:15:28,317 --> 00:15:31,560
of the probable gestational age
of your pregnancy

235
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:33,671
at the time that we plan
to do the procedure.

236
00:15:33,796 --> 00:15:36,458
Now, you can estimate
the age by counting...

237
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,784
We get it, doctor.

238
00:15:37,952 --> 00:15:39,752
- All right?
- I'm sorry.

239
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:42,893
This is useless.

240
00:15:43,018 --> 00:15:46,242
You don't have to go through
the whole procedural options,

241
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:47,477
Blah, blah, blah.

242
00:15:47,602 --> 00:15:49,757
She's not having a baby.
She's having an abortion.

243
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,966
I understand. This is state mandated,
Everything that I'm saying.

244
00:15:53,134 --> 00:15:54,522
I'm trying to save our time.

245
00:15:54,647 --> 00:15:57,036
There's no point
in going through all the details.

246
00:15:57,204 --> 00:16:00,494
I don't care what the state mandates.
We really don't need to hear that.

247
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:04,120
After I finish, then she can
decide what she wants to do.

248
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:06,945
She's already decided
what she wants to do.

249
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:11,334
Unbelievable. I'm supposed to listen
to some right-wing doctor

250
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,607
Give me a trip,
take another day off from work

251
00:16:13,732 --> 00:16:15,821
So he can tell us we're trash.

252
00:16:15,946 --> 00:16:19,586
"Oh, you got a teenage daughter
who's pregnant. You must be trash too."

253
00:16:19,914 --> 00:16:22,114
- It's so insulting.
- I'm sorry!

254
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:24,283
- You don't...
- I'm sorry!

255
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:30,069
It's all right. It's all right.
You are gonna be fine.

256
00:16:30,361 --> 00:16:32,584
Listen to me...
You are gonna do this.

257
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:35,019
And you're gonna live your life,
and this is not...

258
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:37,343
You're not even gonna think
about it anymore, okay?

259
00:16:37,711 --> 00:16:39,276
You don't have to be sorry.

260
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:41,585
You're gonna be fine.
I promise.

261
00:16:42,032 --> 00:16:43,517
You're gonna be fine.

262
00:16:49,564 --> 00:16:50,564
Excuse me.

263
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,152
You're in charge
of the rehab programs, right?

264
00:16:53,277 --> 00:16:54,927
No, but I can help you with it.

265
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:57,697
The nurse said I should talk to you
about getting my mom into rehab?

266
00:16:57,865 --> 00:16:59,465
- What's her name?
- Regina Howard.

267
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:01,801
You're looking
at a 30-day in patient program.

268
00:17:02,712 --> 00:17:03,965
Here, let me see.

269
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:06,600
Looks like
we have an opening around...

270
00:17:07,052 --> 00:17:08,610
the beginning of the year.

271
00:17:10,566 --> 00:17:12,415
But I'm pretty sure you guys,

272
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,094
get cancellations all the time
or whatnot, because my mom...

273
00:17:15,219 --> 00:17:16,382
She needs help now.

274
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,758
Sorry, but the state residential centers
have a really long waiting list.

275
00:17:19,883 --> 00:17:21,254
So there are cancellations,

276
00:17:21,422 --> 00:17:24,396
but you're still probably
looking at around January.

277
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:25,521
January.

278
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:27,593
There are also

279
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,789
private rehab centers out there.

280
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,149
Like...

281
00:17:32,137 --> 00:17:33,266
This is one.

282
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:35,776
They almost always have openings.

283
00:17:37,393 --> 00:17:39,972
- This looks pretty expensive.
- Yeah.

284
00:17:45,141 --> 00:17:48,514
- You know what your problem is?
- No, but I'm sure you're gonna tell me.

285
00:17:48,824 --> 00:17:49,949
What is my problem?

286
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,819
You don't know how to coach Vince.

287
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:54,570
I don't know how to coach?

288
00:17:54,862 --> 00:17:58,090
Said you don't know how to coach Vince.
How to talk to him.

289
00:17:58,258 --> 00:18:01,378
You're not looking at me
and telling me that I can't coach Vince

290
00:18:01,503 --> 00:18:02,946
because he's black and I'm white?

291
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:04,342
- I'm not.
- So What?

292
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:06,662
I might be seeing some things
that you might be missing.

293
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:10,115
This is one of those supremely
irritating conversations that we have.

294
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,471
Are you seeing it
because you're black?

295
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:15,259
I don't understand Vince
because I'm black.

296
00:18:15,384 --> 00:18:17,239
I understand him because he's me.

297
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:20,085
Do you know what it's like to be
the most athletic guy

298
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,303
and then be told,
"Don't follow your instincts.

299
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:24,633
"Follow the playbook,
no matter what"?

300
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:38,348
What am I supposed to do?
What do you want?

301
00:18:38,473 --> 00:18:41,118
- The kid's got to learn the plays.
- Of course, I'm not stupid.

302
00:18:41,243 --> 00:18:42,521
... because they're black.

303
00:18:42,646 --> 00:18:44,509
- Would you stop it?
- I know he's got talent.

304
00:18:44,634 --> 00:18:46,460
I'm trying to give him a skill set.

305
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:47,733
You know what?

306
00:18:48,608 --> 00:18:51,173
You're telling me I can't coach
because you don't like what I do.

307
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,470
Can we have two more, Robin, please?

308
00:18:53,847 --> 00:18:55,450
I do appreciate you...

309
00:18:56,198 --> 00:18:58,918
callin' a cab last night.
But you need to face

310
00:18:59,086 --> 00:19:00,740
the realities about your age,

311
00:19:00,865 --> 00:19:03,915
which is that you can't go
drinking like that on a school night.

312
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,355
- Where is your car?
- Wait. Stop.

313
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,680
- Where is your car?
- Just stop.

314
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,930
I'm stopped.

315
00:19:12,046 --> 00:19:14,376
You don't even remember
what bar you were at, do you?

316
00:19:14,974 --> 00:19:16,138
Go around back.

317
00:19:18,286 --> 00:19:19,438
Good lord.

318
00:19:19,606 --> 00:19:22,274
You need to not feel like you got
to drink everybody down under the table.

319
00:19:22,442 --> 00:19:24,510
- It's right there.
- So it is.

320
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:28,505
There it is.

321
00:19:30,143 --> 00:19:31,143
Right.

322
00:19:31,832 --> 00:19:33,784
You gonna take me to my car?

323
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:35,354
You can walk.

324
00:19:35,647 --> 00:19:37,355
A walk will do you some good.

325
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,558
- Are you serious?
- Fresh air in your hair.

326
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:44,270
- Love you.
- Love you too.

327
00:19:45,198 --> 00:19:47,766
Hope you feel better today.
Love you!

328
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:49,768
- Feel better today!
- See you later.

329
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:58,518
We can't keep doing this.
We're begging to get busted.

330
00:19:58,643 --> 00:19:59,612
I get it.

331
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,747
- I'm not a moron.
- The cops are gonna show up.

332
00:20:01,915 --> 00:20:04,030
- What do you want to do?
- Figure something out.

333
00:20:04,155 --> 00:20:06,752
- That's what I want to do.
- Yeah, I'm coming! One second.

334
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,320
It's getting too risky.

335
00:20:08,488 --> 00:20:09,488
I get it.

336
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,852
We could...
We could, like, you know,

337
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:18,233
- drive them off a cliff.
- They have no engines, Billy.

338
00:20:18,358 --> 00:20:20,255
We've stripped them and sold them.

339
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,380
Good call.

340
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:27,239
I got another idea.

341
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:29,244
We can take them out to the lake,

342
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:32,144
just take the car frames out to the lake
and just dump them in the lake.

343
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:35,147
Yeah, just strap 'em on my back.
I'll swim out there.

344
00:20:35,315 --> 00:20:36,726
We could bury 'em.

345
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,151
We could take 'em out
in the middle of nowhere

346
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:42,095
and just dig a big-ass hole
and just bury them.

347
00:20:45,002 --> 00:20:47,196
- That's a lot of work.
- Yeah, it's a lot of work.

348
00:20:47,321 --> 00:20:49,066
It's a lot of money
we're making off.

349
00:20:49,191 --> 00:20:51,815
It's a lot of trouble
if we don't find a place for 'em.

350
00:20:57,186 --> 00:20:59,498
- Guess we'll bury 'em.
- All right.

351
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:06,051
So, Ryan, how long were you
in Indonesia for?

352
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:08,517
Maybe two months?

353
00:21:08,995 --> 00:21:11,450
First month, we just spent
clearing earthquake debris,

354
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:14,006
and then we started
rebuilding people's houses...

355
00:21:14,131 --> 00:21:16,490
I mean, an amazing experience.

356
00:21:16,682 --> 00:21:18,424
And was all that for school credit?

357
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:21,375
Started out that way, and then...

358
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,297
I kind of wanted
to take an extended leave,

359
00:21:25,465 --> 00:21:27,766
got hooked, and just been
traveling ever since.

360
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:32,704
Did you know you can travel the world
working for Habitat, rebuilding houses?

361
00:21:32,872 --> 00:21:33,909
Yes, honey.

362
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:36,945
So, coach...

363
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,481
Julie tells me you coach football.

364
00:21:41,181 --> 00:21:42,181
I heard...

365
00:21:42,747 --> 00:21:45,153
the other day
it was gonna rain on Friday.

366
00:21:45,392 --> 00:21:46,950
You know, how was that?

367
00:21:48,853 --> 00:21:49,903
How's what?

368
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:54,326
I mean, it must be weird, you know?
Everyone out there

369
00:21:54,494 --> 00:21:55,594
in the rain,

370
00:21:56,129 --> 00:21:57,329
playing football.

371
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,830
You know?
It's raining...

372
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:06,439
- Yeah, it can get pretty weird.
- Are you gonna stay in town or...

373
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:09,474
I'm gonna get some more
of these popovers.

374
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:14,246
Actually, I'm the team leader
of a new building project,

375
00:22:14,414 --> 00:22:16,676
so I'm gonna head
to Arizona next week.

376
00:22:16,801 --> 00:22:19,418
That's a shame.
But you know it's a beautiful place.

377
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,835
That is beautiful there in Arizona.

378
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,867
- Dry.
- It's a desert, honey.

379
00:22:23,992 --> 00:22:25,724
- Very dry.
- I've never been, but...

380
00:22:31,209 --> 00:22:34,032
- She ain't here.
- Actually, I came to talk to you.

381
00:22:37,948 --> 00:22:38,948
Come on.

382
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:49,100
Sir, I know
this is gonna sound a little suspect...

383
00:22:49,653 --> 00:22:52,187
seeing as I just now
started working for you, but...

384
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,820
I'm gonna need an advance
on my check.

385
00:22:57,258 --> 00:22:58,103
Why?

386
00:22:59,614 --> 00:23:00,964
It's nothing bad.

387
00:23:03,211 --> 00:23:04,211
How much?

388
00:23:06,578 --> 00:23:07,399
4 grand.

389
00:23:08,835 --> 00:23:10,569
So what kind of trouble you in?

390
00:23:11,718 --> 00:23:12,818
It's not me.

391
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,094
Between you and I?

392
00:23:20,536 --> 00:23:23,449
I've been trying to get my mom
checked into a rehab center.

393
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:29,221
Don't they have programs, you know,
for lower-income housing?

394
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,040
They're all full.

395
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:34,279
List... The whole city's trying
to get on that list.

396
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:35,664
How is she?

397
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,039
She's not good.

398
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,205
I can't give you an advance, Vince.

399
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:46,631
Son, I just don't have it.

400
00:23:47,294 --> 00:23:50,048
Look here. I want you to hear this.
Hear me now.

401
00:23:50,724 --> 00:23:53,445
I'm saying no to the money,
but not to you.

402
00:23:54,616 --> 00:23:57,916
I'm proud of you for asking me,
'cause I know it ain't easy,

403
00:23:58,084 --> 00:24:00,373
and I know you trying
to do something with your life now.

404
00:24:00,498 --> 00:24:02,796
And I want you to know
I believe in you.

405
00:24:04,308 --> 00:24:05,908
We'll figure this out.

406
00:24:10,112 --> 00:24:11,112
All right.

407
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:13,085
Thank you.

408
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,743
You're welcome.

409
00:24:21,572 --> 00:24:23,174
How come you believe in him?

410
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,678
Past three years, you been saying
that Vince ain't nothing

411
00:24:26,846 --> 00:24:28,306
but a no-good lowlife,

412
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:31,616
and suddenly you find it
so necessary to be there for him.

413
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,972
I can never get you
to come to Caleb's games

414
00:24:37,097 --> 00:24:40,726
or show up to the Lions' games
when I'm dancing on the sidelines

415
00:24:40,851 --> 00:24:44,229
or come to my academic smackdown
when I'm scoring points,

416
00:24:44,354 --> 00:24:45,354
but...

417
00:24:45,766 --> 00:24:48,985
you want to go
and watch Vince practice.

418
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,930
And you're proud of him.

419
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:59,134
I try really hard
to make you proud too.

420
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,489
Babe.

421
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,880
Hey, honey?

422
00:25:23,626 --> 00:25:26,604
What do you think Julie would do
if she got pregnant?

423
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:29,707
- What?
- She's not pregnant, honey.

424
00:25:30,784 --> 00:25:32,687
But what do you think she would do?

425
00:25:32,812 --> 00:25:34,262
What are you doing?

426
00:25:35,347 --> 00:25:37,622
I mean, would she...
Would she talk to us?

427
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:39,997
She would talk to us, wouldn't she?

428
00:25:40,643 --> 00:25:41,719
What would she do?

429
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:44,716
- Oh, babe, it's 3:00 in the morning.
- You think she'd feel comfortable...

430
00:25:44,841 --> 00:25:47,852
You want to talk about Julie
and having a hypothetical pregnancy.

431
00:25:47,977 --> 00:25:50,128
Are you crazy?
That's just wrong.

432
00:25:50,687 --> 00:25:52,393
We're both having nightmares.

433
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:54,365
Well, don't do that.
Come to bed.

434
00:25:54,533 --> 00:25:55,652
Come to bed.

435
00:25:57,301 --> 00:25:59,118
Come.
Y'all come to bed.

436
00:26:05,687 --> 00:26:06,788
Can't sleep?

437
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,414
How's the hip?

438
00:26:09,582 --> 00:26:10,582
It's good.

439
00:26:11,515 --> 00:26:12,817
Something's bothering you.

440
00:26:13,103 --> 00:26:17,107
I don't know what it is. I'm not gonna
pry if it's none of my business.

441
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:19,578
I'm good.

442
00:26:21,057 --> 00:26:22,350
Is it football?

443
00:26:24,676 --> 00:26:25,826
I'm your dad.

444
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,433
If something's bothering you,
it's bothering me.

445
00:26:39,146 --> 00:26:41,646
There's a girl,
and I got her pregnant.

446
00:26:42,043 --> 00:26:43,643
I got a girl pregnant.

447
00:26:52,368 --> 00:26:54,882
I really didn't mean
to disappoint you. I'm sorry.

448
00:27:01,207 --> 00:27:03,201
Vince, come here.
Come here.

449
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:07,205
- Yes?
- Look, this series,

450
00:27:07,373 --> 00:27:10,107
don't wait on your reads.
You see something you like, you take it.

451
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:11,876
- But you said...
- Don't worry about

452
00:27:12,044 --> 00:27:14,545
what I said. Worry about what
I'm telling you right now, understood?

453
00:27:15,147 --> 00:27:15,974
Yeah.

454
00:27:17,883 --> 00:27:19,479
- We good?
- Yeah. Good.

455
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:22,998
Okay, they're running wing trips,
double slant.

456
00:27:23,123 --> 00:27:25,753
I want you to run to the slant, and
I want you to knock Vince on his ass.

457
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:27,491

Why are you telling us the play?

458
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:29,488
I tell you because I want you
to sack Vince,

459
00:27:29,613 --> 00:27:33,213
and if you can't do that now,
you really are a bunch of jug butts.

460
00:27:33,565 --> 00:27:34,732
- Ready?
- Break!

461
00:27:45,762 --> 00:27:46,878
Ready. Set.

462
00:27:47,614 --> 00:27:48,775
Hut, hike!

463
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,336
Your father told me what's happened.

464
00:28:45,915 --> 00:28:48,403
I couldn't keep something
like this from your mother.

465
00:28:48,528 --> 00:28:49,828
It's okay, Luke.

466
00:28:50,403 --> 00:28:53,140
Mary and Joseph thought
they were in a situation, too, at first.

467
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,079
Becky and me
are not Mary and Joseph, mom.

468
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:57,424
Becky.
That's her name?

469
00:28:58,853 --> 00:29:01,003
Well, we need to meet this Becky,

470
00:29:01,686 --> 00:29:04,086
and then we'll figure out
what to do.

471
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,538
How did you figure out
how to get up here?

472
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,900
Well, any place I go,
I look for the highest building

473
00:29:25,957 --> 00:29:27,311
or vantage point or whatever,

474
00:29:28,506 --> 00:29:29,947
and I try to find a way up.

475
00:29:33,988 --> 00:29:35,639
This is pretty good.

476
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,555
It's higher up

477
00:29:38,248 --> 00:29:40,391
than any building
in Pavones, Costa Rica.

478
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,711
What's the best place
you've ever been?

479
00:29:44,191 --> 00:29:45,291
That's easy.

480
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,302
Senegal, West Africa.

481
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,190
I'll show you.

482
00:29:52,341 --> 00:29:53,541
Which is maybe

483
00:29:53,805 --> 00:29:56,307
9,000 miles that way,

484
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:58,242
which would make Oaxaca

485
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:02,032
1,000 miles in this direction
and New York

486
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:04,770
1,500 miles that way.

487
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,329
What about you?

488
00:30:08,846 --> 00:30:10,020
Where are you headed...

489
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,760
eventually?

490
00:30:13,836 --> 00:30:14,986
Eventually...

491
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:17,365
I don't know.

492
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:21,322
Do you hate it here?

493
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:23,142
I used to hate it,

494
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,210
and then...

495
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,279
I just...

496
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:30,681
kind of changed.

497
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,603
I guess I just...

498
00:30:34,844 --> 00:30:36,447
I really want to see the world.

499
00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:39,831
And that sounds really cliche.

500
00:30:39,956 --> 00:30:41,406
No, it doesn't.

501
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:49,965
Look.

502
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,028
What?

503
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:52,865
That's you...

504
00:30:53,813 --> 00:30:55,098
seeing the world.

505
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,375
It's really beautiful up here.

506
00:31:27,132 --> 00:31:28,332
This is the...

507
00:31:29,009 --> 00:31:31,547
stupidest thing we've ever done.

508
00:31:32,105 --> 00:31:34,137
Stupidest thing
we've ever done by far.

509
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:36,406
I don't want to hear about it
right now, Tim.

510
00:31:39,138 --> 00:31:40,238
This hole...

511
00:31:40,575 --> 00:31:42,412
never gonna be big enough, Billy.

512
00:31:42,956 --> 00:31:46,306
You know what, man?
I am sick of your lame-ass attitude!

513
00:31:46,597 --> 00:31:47,797
God, I mean...

514
00:31:48,393 --> 00:31:52,397
You gotta make it a 100 times worse than
what it is! Is it a bad situation? Yes!

515
00:31:53,005 --> 00:31:56,693
Are we doing everything that we can to
get out of it? You bet your ass we are!

516
00:31:56,861 --> 00:31:59,917
I don't understand what the point
of jumping on my case about it is

517
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:01,832
- every 5 seconds.
- The point is, I'm done.

518
00:32:03,134 --> 00:32:04,134
I'm done.

519
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,160
We've made our money.

520
00:32:06,671 --> 00:32:08,571
We've made it and then some.

521
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:11,586
Promise me we're out.
This is it.

522
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,332
No more illegal crap,
no more chop shop.

523
00:32:14,457 --> 00:32:15,979
We're done.
It's over, Billy.

524
00:32:19,461 --> 00:32:21,661
Let's just go back to fixing cars.

525
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,782
Riggins' Rigs, brothers, that's it.
Keep it simple.

526
00:32:28,348 --> 00:32:30,127
Promise me that.
We're done.

527
00:32:43,467 --> 00:32:46,376
And I want you to stop yelling at me
because I didn't go to college.

528
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,470
Anything else?

529
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:56,919
And I also want to be a partner.

530
00:32:58,408 --> 00:32:59,303
Maybe.

531
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,450
I'm kidding.

532
00:33:11,173 --> 00:33:14,423
Just 'cause you're a partner doesn't
mean I can't tell you to dig, so...

533
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:16,761
let's dig.

534
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:08,124
Is Miss Taylor here?

535
00:34:09,054 --> 00:34:10,234
Yeah, she is.

536
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:12,392
Come on in.

537
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:15,939
Hon, it's all right.

538
00:34:16,064 --> 00:34:17,624
You wanna go on into the kitchen.

539
00:34:17,749 --> 00:34:19,565
I'm really sorry I woke you guys up.

540
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,090
It's okay. It's all right.
Go on back to bed, sweetheart.

541
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:25,442
I've an appointment
for my abortion tomorrow.

542
00:34:26,477 --> 00:34:28,011
My mom knows.
She's coming with me.

543
00:34:29,763 --> 00:34:30,590
Good.

544
00:34:31,205 --> 00:34:32,021
Yeah.

545
00:34:32,836 --> 00:34:34,751
So why do I feel so weird?

546
00:34:38,282 --> 00:34:40,032
'Cause it's a hard thing.

547
00:34:40,717 --> 00:34:42,741
This is a hard situation.

548
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:48,083
Have you thought
about what you want?

549
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:53,369
We don't have any money.

550
00:34:54,832 --> 00:34:56,482
I'm in the tenth grade.

551
00:34:59,267 --> 00:35:00,917
It was my first time...

552
00:35:03,662 --> 00:35:05,050
and I threw it away,

553
00:35:05,175 --> 00:35:07,675
but I don't want to throw
my life away.

554
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:13,592
It was just really obvious that my mom
wants me to have this abortion...

555
00:35:16,438 --> 00:35:17,660
'Cause I was her mistake.

556
00:35:18,093 --> 00:35:20,682
And she has to just
struggle and hurt

557
00:35:21,061 --> 00:35:23,103
every day, and she wanted better,

558
00:35:23,228 --> 00:35:24,400
and I knew better,

559
00:35:25,008 --> 00:35:27,009
and I was just thinking,
"Forget what she wants."

560
00:35:27,134 --> 00:35:28,684
Like, "What do I want?"

561
00:35:29,221 --> 00:35:33,153
Maybe I could take care of this baby,
and maybe I would be good at it.

562
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:36,762
And I could love it,
and I would be there for it.

563
00:35:37,688 --> 00:35:40,699
And then I was just thinking
about how awful it would be

564
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:42,652
if I had the baby,

565
00:35:42,994 --> 00:35:45,991
and then I spent
the rest of my life resenting him...

566
00:35:47,554 --> 00:35:48,508
Or her.

567
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,098
Do you think I'm going to hell
if I have an abortion?

568
00:35:56,918 --> 00:35:58,477
No, honey, I don't.

569
00:36:10,466 --> 00:36:12,281
What would you tell your daughter?

570
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:20,067
I would tell her...

571
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:27,635
to think about

572
00:36:28,022 --> 00:36:29,072
her life...

573
00:36:32,035 --> 00:36:34,380
and think about
what's important to her

574
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:36,553
and what she wants.

575
00:36:37,604 --> 00:36:40,704
And I'd tell her that
she's in a real tough spot...

576
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,003
and that I would support her
whatever decision she made.

577
00:36:57,203 --> 00:36:59,180
I can't take care of a baby.

578
00:37:06,037 --> 00:37:07,037
I can't.

579
00:37:30,283 --> 00:37:31,833
You guys want a ride?

580
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:36,031
No, we'll be okay.

581
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:18,040
Let's get this kid back!
Come on!

582
00:38:18,956 --> 00:38:19,786
What?

583
00:38:23,891 --> 00:38:25,915
Come on, 44!
Come on, 44!

584
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:28,517
Push him inside!
Get the 15, come on!

585
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:33,189
Okay, Caleb!

586
00:38:33,357 --> 00:38:36,158
How many times I got to tell you,
you want to push your man inside!

587
00:38:36,326 --> 00:38:38,022
Don't let him use the sideline!

588
00:38:38,147 --> 00:38:40,729
Hey, force him into the middle
so that he can't use his speed!

589
00:38:41,407 --> 00:38:42,932
That's the third time they've run

590
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,271
that sweep play.
You got to be ready for it.

591
00:38:45,396 --> 00:38:46,446
Hey, Caleb!

592
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:52,424
You have fun out there, hear?

593
00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:53,549
All right.

594
00:39:04,089 --> 00:39:07,061
And visiting hours are on thursdays
between 4:00 and 7:00.

595
00:39:08,058 --> 00:39:09,648
And group starts in about

596
00:39:09,934 --> 00:39:11,693
ten minutes, so...

597
00:39:13,181 --> 00:39:16,031
- I'll give you a few moments, okay?
- Appreciate that.

598
00:39:18,468 --> 00:39:21,168
You know I'm gonna be home
real soon, okay?

599
00:39:22,022 --> 00:39:25,074
And I-I-I don't want you
worrying about me.

600
00:39:25,636 --> 00:39:26,786
Listen to me.

601
00:39:29,135 --> 00:39:30,485
I believe in you.

602
00:39:32,768 --> 00:39:34,068
You can do this.

603
00:39:35,703 --> 00:39:37,547
I know.
I can do this.

604
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:41,969
Come here.

605
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:45,796
Come on, mom.

606
00:39:45,921 --> 00:39:46,921
It's okay.

607
00:39:48,087 --> 00:39:50,237
- Thank you.
- Good luck, Vince.

608
00:40:05,432 --> 00:40:06,782
For today, the total bill

609
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:09,950
will be $4,000.
How did you want to pay for that?

610
00:40:14,735 --> 00:40:15,885
There you go.

611
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:21,630
Okay, thank you.

612
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:24,167
Thank you.

613
00:40:59,714 --> 00:41:00,964
I got you, man.

614
00:41:05,675 --> 00:41:08,681
I'm sorry it's been so hard for us
to talk the last couple of days.

615
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,198
Listen, Becky, if...

616
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:15,325
<i>I'm sorry if in any way
I've made you feel like this whole thing</i>

617
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:17,586
<i>is just your problem,
'cause it's not, okay?</i>

618
00:41:18,818 --> 00:41:21,668
I guess I just really
need you to know that...

619
00:41:22,766 --> 00:41:24,066
you're not in...

620
00:41:26,174 --> 00:41:27,195
That I'll be there

621
00:41:27,363 --> 00:41:29,020
<i>no matter what, okay?</i>

622
00:41:29,327 --> 00:41:30,327
<i>I will...</i>

623
00:41:31,473 --> 00:41:32,288
Like,

624
00:41:32,588 --> 00:41:34,777
help us raise our kid

625
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:36,505
or help you.

626
00:41:41,111 --> 00:41:43,879
<i>And I know that we're young,
and I know that we don't know</i>

627
00:41:44,047 --> 00:41:46,497
each other very well
right now, but...

628
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,284
that doesn't matter.
What matters is that

629
00:41:49,661 --> 00:41:51,807
<i>you need to know
you're not alone in this.</i>

630
00:41:52,224 --> 00:41:53,809
