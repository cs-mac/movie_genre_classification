1
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:04,243
Immaculate Conception

2
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:18,626
Well, Rachel. Let's start with prayer.

3
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:25,520
Heavenly Father, we are so grateful,

4
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:27,688
that we can gather here

5
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:32,694
Conversation with Rachel Angela McKnight on her 15th birthday.

6
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:38,241
We are grateful for her obedience and love of life.

7
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,786
Please bless this conversation with the frank

8
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:45,957
Let us keep your spirit.

00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,878
We look forward to the day of arrival savior. Amen!

10
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:52,587
Amen. -Amen.

11
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:04,349
What's this? -Cassette.

12
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:09,437
The regulations require the oral record of all conversations

13
00:03:09,604 --> 00:03:12,190
from 15 year.

14
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:14,150
Is new?

15
00:03:16,861 --> 00:03:19,405
But it can be used in a malicious purposes,

16
00:03:19,572 --> 00:03:22,158
therefore kept only trustworthy.

17
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,998
Will the conversation here?

18
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:32,627
Because they can be trusted, right?

19
00:03:34,754 --> 00:03:36,548
Reply son.

20
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:41,594
You can trust me. -Great.

21
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:44,806
Well, Rachel.

22
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:47,016
Here we go.

23
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:52,354
Do you believe in God, the Eternal Father? To us his son Jesus

24
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,981
came to redeem?

25
00:03:55,148 --> 00:03:58,361
And you know the commandments of God?

26
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:00,279
Ja.

27
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:06,244
Or backing a Paul McKnight as a prophet, seer, razkrivalca,

28
00:04:06,411 --> 00:04:09,079
you admit it to the sole of the Earth,

29
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:11,873
can fulfill the mission of the priest?

30
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:16,253
Ja. Until now, I want to say.

31
00:04:17,754 --> 00:04:22,175
It will be good. Next.

32
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:25,053
Hang out with any group or individual,

33
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:28,599
who teach or carry anything that would be contrary to

34
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:31,393
učenostjo with this church?

35
00:04:32,144 --> 00:04:36,189
I do not. If you do not include g. Willa.

36
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:39,734
on

37
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:45,698
Worship mom and dad? -You know it better than me.

38
00:04:46,908 --> 00:04:51,454
You can pritrdiš and you will still be close to the truth.

39
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:55,792
So move on with the utmost seriousness.

40
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,506
Do you live decently? Yeah.

41
00:05:12,976 --> 00:05:14,601
Show. No!

42
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,980
I want to hear just how I talk. -As a child!

43
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:23,070
How did it go? I think I did.

44
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:32,202
G. Will! Hold it!

45
00:05:32,453 --> 00:05:35,415
It is used in God's purposes.

46
00:05:36,456 --> 00:05:39,334
Rachel! Leave your brother alone.

47
00:05:46,383 --> 00:05:50,887
Look under the bed. -I can not find it!

48
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:52,056
Turn off the lights.

49
00:05:53,474 --> 00:05:54,558
Rachel ...

50
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:56,518
I know!

51
00:06:09,905 --> 00:06:12,324
Somewhere small. -Very small.

52
00:06:12,491 --> 00:06:15,787
Mine is. -Thank you lent it to her.

53
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,498
Do not forget to pray.

54
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:24,670
Tell us a story? It's late already.

55
00:06:24,837 --> 00:06:27,131
Please, Mom. -Please!

56
00:06:28,549 --> 00:06:29,592
Please.

57
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:33,971
Turn off the light.

58
00:06:38,642 --> 00:06:42,396
Once upon a time there was a princess ...

59
00:06:42,562 --> 00:06:43,605
* No

60
00:06:43,688 --> 00:06:46,149
Tell us a story. -I am telling you it.

61
00:06:46,316 --> 00:06:49,028
No, what about the Mustang. What?

62
00:06:49,904 --> 00:06:52,489
What about the red Mustang.

63
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:55,451
I've already told you?

64
00:06:57,911 --> 00:07:01,915
Good, but the secret is not to hear anyone else.

65
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,086
Raise your hand like this.

66
00:07:07,838 --> 00:07:11,674
Make tale character, and Nod,

67
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,512
You'll swear you will not tell anyone.

68
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:22,018
Once upon a time in the land

69
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:26,439
on the other side of the red rocks of southern Utah

70
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:28,983
Princess ... Perhaps you know.

71
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,821
It may even be in the room and tells you

72
00:07:32,988 --> 00:07:34,613
this story ...

73
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:37,741
... found

74
00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:40,661
Mustang.

75
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,874
Do you know what mustang? -Horse.

76
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,461
It was a hot day.

77
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:54,050
I was looking for someone that I lost.

78
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:57,343
Who had a birthday today.

79
00:07:57,552 --> 00:07:59,846
Rachel! -So.

80
00:08:00,556 --> 00:08:02,682
I searched and searched ...

81
00:08:04,642 --> 00:08:06,603
It was very sad.

82
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:11,400
Then I felt something.

83
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,364
Special feeling was, he brought me in a certain direction.

84
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,660
Then I found it!

85
00:08:24,078 --> 00:08:25,914
Red Mustang.

86
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,211
I wanted to pet him and would not let me.

87
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:38,009
I had a strong feeling that I will bring to Rachel.

88
00:08:38,926 --> 00:08:44,808
I felt my spirit crawls from the tip of your fingers down your leg up

89
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:49,020
knee to the skull,

90
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:51,439
and back through his hair.

91
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:56,027
And you know where this is leading me, right?

92
00:09:06,203 --> 00:09:08,038
I felt ...

93
00:09:08,163 --> 00:09:10,122
Mustang!

94
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,710
... red mustang ...

95
00:11:07,238 --> 00:11:10,115
You know that better than me.

96
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,869
I think I can ...

97
00:11:15,497 --> 00:11:18,917
Well, let's proceed with the utmost seriousness.

98
00:12:57,429 --> 00:12:58,763
Rachel?

99
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:07,022
What are you doing?

100
00:13:12,276 --> 00:13:16,697
Where is it? Where? Give it to me!

101
00:13:18,783 --> 00:13:20,744
Where did you put it?

102
00:13:23,371 --> 00:13:25,123
Give it to me! No, mine is.

103
00:13:25,206 --> 00:13:27,249
Stop it! You will get us in trouble.

104
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:28,917
No! Stop it!

105
00:13:31,254 --> 00:13:33,298
Stop it! Give it to me.

106
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:36,342
What is going on here?

107
00:13:43,182 --> 00:13:44,892
Come on.

108
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:50,564
What has happened, something you did not want?

109
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:55,193
You g. Will you do something? What? No!

110
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,196
No.

111
00:13:58,864 --> 00:14:03,577
Are you honest with me? -There is nothing to do.

112
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:18,925
Halo.

113
00:14:20,302 --> 00:14:22,554
Halo.

114
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:25,223
Halo.

115
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:32,146
Halo.

116
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,567
Hello, hello.

117
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:40,238
Works.

118
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:46,285
Here Rachel Angela McKnight.

119
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:50,456
Born on 8 May 1996

120
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:53,000
15 years old.

121
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:57,755
A few weeks ago I experienced a miracle.

122
00:15:00,174 --> 00:15:03,094
I heard an angelic voice

123
00:15:03,427 --> 00:15:07,014
for which I found myself in dire need.

124
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,525
And the angel said to her. "Do not be afraid, Mary,

125
00:15:20,027 --> 00:15:23,238
"For God is watching goodness.

126
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:29,702
"You got pregnant and gave birth to a son.

127
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:31,746
"And his name is ..."

128
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:32,998
Jesus.

129
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,836
Then Mary said to the angel:

130
00:15:38,212 --> 00:15:42,131
"How is this possible, but if you do not know a man?"

131
00:15:45,218 --> 00:15:47,219
And the angel answered.

132
00:15:47,888 --> 00:15:50,848
"Visiting this will Sv. Duh

133
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:54,602
"Power and High will overshadow.

134
00:15:55,937 --> 00:15:59,942
"Therefore, the holiest by you born

135
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:02,735
"Son of God."

136
00:16:06,072 --> 00:16:09,575
The only voice which I heard was the song on the tape.

137
00:16:11,285 --> 00:16:13,579
Is it possible that we did it on?

138
00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:17,875
This wonderful blessing of the heavenly life.

139
00:16:21,295 --> 00:16:24,673
Voice which sang of this miraculous and spiritual words ...

140
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,553
"Do not leave me waiting by the phone."

141
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:30,554
They live.

142
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:36,100
He has given me little one Jesus?

143
00:16:38,103 --> 00:16:39,479
Amen.

144
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,937
Tell Rachel to come over. I understand.

145
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:29,319
Do not leave me waiting by the phone.

146
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:41,247
Doing inventories at the end of the world?

147
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:46,085
For a long time I did not have.

148
00:17:46,335 --> 00:17:48,589
How much time?

149
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:51,842
Months. -It is normal.

150
00:17:52,343 --> 00:17:55,221
In your years come and go.

151
00:17:59,307 --> 00:18:01,476
Sometimes ...

152
00:18:01,851 --> 00:18:06,189
After a while you do not, it means you're pregnant.

153
00:18:08,358 --> 00:18:10,818
I think that's it.

154
00:18:15,573 --> 00:18:19,202
I'm so relieved. I thought you'd be angry.

155
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,458
A few months ago ...

156
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:29,336
When I was in the basement, I found a blue tape

157
00:18:29,628 --> 00:18:31,963
and something happened ...

158
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,718
I think I'm pregnant with God through this blue tape.

159
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:42,098
Get in the car.

160
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:57,072
I need the keys.

161
00:18:57,573 --> 00:19:00,784
Is everything all right? -Women's problems.

162
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,384
I would really like to explain. No, it's my fault.

163
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:21,887
I should not have charged the head of all those stories.

164
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:24,390
No! Do not talk about it.

165
00:19:25,183 --> 00:19:27,017
As long as we do not know for sure.

166
00:20:14,398 --> 00:20:17,860
Ten minutes had passed. -Good.

167
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,244
It's a miracle!

168
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:39,422
The role of mother is a very responsible job.

169
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:43,593
I did not have a choice.

170
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:48,306
Mom said she was surprised every time.

171
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:53,477
But I believe that the role of mother

172
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:56,939
can not be met without a father.

173
00:21:00,151 --> 00:21:03,654
The truth is that the man on the tape did it.

174
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:08,117
God's assistant tape.

175
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:17,960
Let's start with a prayer, Rachel. Will you lead?

176
00:21:23,757 --> 00:21:28,387
Dear Heavenly Father, we are grateful to you for this opportunity

177
00:21:28,512 --> 00:21:32,933
Conversation at the last minute, in order to understand the mysterious ways ...

178
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:37,980
We are grateful for the cassette and ...

179
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:39,690
Phones.

180
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:43,776
Please give us a good feeling

181
00:21:43,943 --> 00:21:47,948
and the spirit of understanding in the name of Jesus Christ.

182
00:21:48,198 --> 00:21:50,617
Amen. -Amen.

183
00:21:57,374 --> 00:22:01,460
Rachel, I was told that wearing a baby.

184
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,795
Is this true?

185
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:10,928
I called Ben Brooksbyja.

186
00:22:11,721 --> 00:22:16,267
His son, Elijah Brooksby, has agreed to marry you.

187
00:22:16,392 --> 00:22:18,727
Rachel, whoever did this,

188
00:22:18,811 --> 00:22:21,772
obviously not suitable for the father of your child.

189
00:22:21,855 --> 00:22:22,898
Not really.

190
00:22:23,023 --> 00:22:25,734
Rachel, you have sinned. I'm not.

191
00:22:27,236 --> 00:22:30,948
Maybe I was listening to something they should not.

192
00:22:31,198 --> 00:22:33,826
And then ... Then I got pregnant.

193
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:38,872
A few months ago

194
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:42,960
I found a tape in the basement,

195
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:45,838
recorded music, and I felt,

196
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:48,382
how my spirit slipping from the fingertips to the head.

197
00:22:48,506 --> 00:22:51,592
It was also as with Mary, as in your sermon!

198
00:22:51,676 --> 00:22:56,680
I found Rachel and g. Willa, who are doing something.

199
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:06,858
Rachel, get up, g. Will you sit down, please.

200
00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:20,037
G. Will, Rachel is pregnant with you?

201
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:21,372
I do not. No, I'm not.

202
00:23:21,497 --> 00:23:26,377
Now we are not talking to you, Rachel, but with g. Will.

203
00:23:26,543 --> 00:23:28,170
It was not me.

204
00:23:30,756 --> 00:23:33,426
I have no choice.

205
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:37,096
Tomorrow, g. Will you leave this family,

206
00:23:37,263 --> 00:23:39,807
Rachel, you're getting married to Elijahom Brooksbyjem.

207
00:23:40,224 --> 00:23:42,810
Mom, we did not do anything. To bed.

208
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:02,830
Elijah Brooksby?

209
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:06,082
Marrying Elijahom Brooksbyjem?

210
00:24:08,293 --> 00:24:12,131
I do not need to ask God, I know that's not right.

211
00:24:17,052 --> 00:24:18,177
The horse ...

212
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:23,258
Your big toes,

213
00:26:23,425 --> 00:26:25,636
as large as houses in a row ...

214
00:26:27,055 --> 00:26:29,264
So goes the story ...

215
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:32,768
Take it easy.

216
00:26:36,521 --> 00:26:37,856
Hallelujah.

217
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:23,108
Mom, wake up!

218
00:27:24,151 --> 00:27:25,444
Mama! Stop it!

219
00:27:30,908 --> 00:27:31,992
Rachel!

220
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:35,120
Rachel, stop! -Rachel, come back!

221
00:27:35,996 --> 00:27:38,999
Come on, open up.

222
00:27:39,082 --> 00:27:41,792
No, do not. Do not do this.

223
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,754
Stop immediately, Rachel!

224
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:49,217
Good evening, friends and relatives,

225
00:27:53,888 --> 00:27:56,098
rushing down the road,

226
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,559
after which I went.

227
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,400
Passing through the red rocks

228
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:10,321
from home, which I can not say home.

229
00:28:14,701 --> 00:28:18,371
I am looking for his father, the holy child,

230
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:22,583
a man who sings on the tape.

231
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,815
I'm here.

232
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,024
In the beginning was the word.

233
00:30:13,817 --> 00:30:16,236
And the word was with God.

234
00:30:18,446 --> 00:30:20,657
And the word was God.

235
00:30:22,368 --> 00:30:24,578
In him was life.

236
00:30:25,161 --> 00:30:28,164
And the life was the light of men.

237
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:32,376
And the light shone in the darkness.

238
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,297
And the darkness has not understood it.

239
00:30:37,965 --> 00:30:40,259
God sent a man.

240
00:30:41,052 --> 00:30:45,306
He was not the light, but he was witness to the light.

241
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,938
I am looking guy who plays the guitar.

242
00:30:54,105 --> 00:30:56,191
Perhaps it is a little younger than you.

243
00:30:57,193 --> 00:30:58,235
well

244
00:30:58,444 --> 00:31:02,031
There is a club where young people go to listen to music.

245
00:31:02,698 --> 00:31:03,906
It?

246
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:12,958
Hello, sir.

247
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:18,129
This time I first meet someone like you.

248
00:31:18,755 --> 00:31:22,675
Can I come in? -You must have 18 years.

249
00:31:23,551 --> 00:31:26,012
I was already at the bar.

250
00:31:26,304 --> 00:31:27,972
Get out of here!

251
00:31:28,264 --> 00:31:29,891
That's what I deserved.

252
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,312
That's my girl.

253
00:31:36,815 --> 00:31:38,567
Where have you been?

254
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:40,610
Thanks for letting us play.

255
00:31:41,861 --> 00:31:43,822
We can not stay and listen to other bands?

256
00:31:44,114 --> 00:31:46,908
What Madonna? We have a right.

257
00:31:47,075 --> 00:31:49,953
You can even hear the other bands?

258
00:31:58,377 --> 00:31:59,837
well

259
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:01,756
Next time.

260
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:04,967
Cheese is here.

261
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,473
Where are you going? -You want to come?

262
00:32:11,766 --> 00:32:13,767
John wants to give birth to my children.

263
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:16,395
What? -Just a little deaf.

264
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:19,982
Few deaf. -These are good options.

265
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:23,360
You're the girl from the prairies?

266
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:25,403
Come on already!

267
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:30,116
I only partial loss of hearing. It's quite sexy, is not it?

268
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,161
You did this?

269
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:39,419
Can I go with you?

270
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:45,757
Ja. It is a boy from the prairies to you?

271
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:48,259
Come on. What are you doing here?

272
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:51,262
We're going home and you will recognize his father.

273
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:54,390
Take the car keys and go.

274
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:58,227
Rachel, I was kicked out because you're going, if you're open.

275
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:01,563
I have a gun to bed. This conflict can be resolved

276
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:02,940
at my home.

277
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:08,445
Take the keys and go. Without recognition-Sun

278
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:12,575
Get out. Shit!

279
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:14,619
Are you really insist on the go early on the Virgin Mary?

280
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:16,996
I said I'm not going to let you drive.

281
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:21,541
Are you going? Close the door.

282
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:24,795
Motherfucker! That was close.

283
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,426
Everything is fine.

284
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,486
I wanted to make sure that you are honest.

285
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,747
You have once again interfered in my steering wheel, motherfuckers?

286
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,127
That's right, motherfuckers.

287
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:08,838
Say it!

288
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,093
We do not curse.

289
00:34:15,552 --> 00:34:16,638
well

290
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,724
Sooner or later you'll be cursing.

291
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:59,638
Promise to be recognized? I told the truth, Mr.. Will.

292
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:19,925
Vain.

293
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:23,469
You think I'm pretty?

294
00:36:25,055 --> 00:36:27,558
Here it is. Do you like it?

295
00:36:30,852 --> 00:36:32,438
Sit down.

296
00:36:34,523 --> 00:36:36,023
Sit down.

297
00:36:39,528 --> 00:36:43,489
I did not hear your name. -G. Will.

298
00:36:43,822 --> 00:36:49,578
G. Will? Hi, g. Will I g. Clyde.

299
00:36:50,454 --> 00:36:52,581
Call me Clyde.

300
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,626
Or master.

301
00:36:56,252 --> 00:36:58,296
As manager call me.

302
00:36:59,088 --> 00:37:01,381
I do not shoot, I promise.

303
00:37:01,507 --> 00:37:03,967
Hello! Clyde, put the rifle.

304
00:37:09,723 --> 00:37:12,976
Can I watch?

305
00:37:14,061 --> 00:37:17,564
Oh, my God! 're From the prairies?

306
00:37:17,898 --> 00:37:19,858
No, from Utah.

307
00:37:20,566 --> 00:37:21,694
Where is it?

308
00:37:22,153 --> 00:37:24,530
Let's get out of this hole.

309
00:37:27,074 --> 00:37:29,243
Would you play?

310
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,456
When you play? Rock 'n roll I really like.

311
00:37:35,748 --> 00:37:37,583
Currently we have a break.

312
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:41,713
Tomorrow you play. Yeah.

313
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:45,883
Come on, if you will. Bye.

314
00:37:46,676 --> 00:37:47,885
Bye.

315
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,475
Raise your toes.

316
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:56,478
It's called "Never" ...

317
00:37:56,644 --> 00:38:00,481
Say for example: "I have never been in jail."

318
00:38:02,066 --> 00:38:04,735
On a shrink because he was in jail.

319
00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:07,613
What happened?

320
00:38:08,155 --> 00:38:11,199
I shot my mom's dog, but he turned me.

321
00:38:11,909 --> 00:38:14,495
I was kicked out, but nothing serious.

322
00:38:14,995 --> 00:38:17,498
This is terrible.

323
00:38:18,414 --> 00:38:22,754
If you play this shit ... "I never" had a menstrual period.

324
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,839
Clyde ... That's so silly.

325
00:38:24,964 --> 00:38:27,592
So stupid.

326
00:38:27,758 --> 00:38:30,094
It's my turn.

327
00:38:31,637 --> 00:38:34,640
"I never" ate a hamburger.

328
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:37,475
All of us will overcome.

329
00:38:38,184 --> 00:38:41,187
I would like to try one, I'm pretty hungry.

330
00:38:41,438 --> 00:38:44,607
"I have never" been in Mexico.

331
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:47,694
"Never" was pregnant.

332
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:51,990
Clyde, stop those which apply only to one sex.

333
00:38:55,076 --> 00:38:58,204
Are you pregnant? -She's pregnant.

334
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:04,377
Yeah, something like that.

335
00:39:05,545 --> 00:39:08,422
Father, I am looking for, so that's okay.

336
00:39:10,299 --> 00:39:13,135
I did not commit.

337
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,641
So you're a slut? Do not be a jerk!

338
00:39:17,807 --> 00:39:20,351
Do not listen to him.

339
00:39:22,687 --> 00:39:25,814
"I never" speak after mobilcu.

340
00:39:26,691 --> 00:39:31,529
I have it. Where is it? You did not say you were pregnant?

341
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:34,865
All the girls are pregnant. All are pregnant.

342
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,034
What does this mean? Here you go.

343
00:39:38,326 --> 00:39:40,787
Hold it to your ear.

344
00:39:41,162 --> 00:39:42,705
Call her. -You take it off.

345
00:39:44,626 --> 00:39:45,834
They call her.

346
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:50,839
Hello?

347
00:39:54,634 --> 00:39:56,886
Here Rachel. Can you hear me?

348
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:00,807
Checking the microphone. One, two, three. Hello?

349
00:40:01,141 --> 00:40:04,560
Testing, one, two, three. Can you hear me?

350
00:40:04,727 --> 00:40:07,230
Do not leave me waiting by the phone.

351
00:40:07,397 --> 00:40:08,856
I like this one.

352
00:40:08,981 --> 00:40:11,651
Do not leave me waiting by the phone.

353
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:16,155
Beeps! -Press the green button.

354
00:40:16,865 --> 00:40:18,074
Push play.

355
00:40:20,035 --> 00:40:21,118
They live.

356
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:24,456
Would later be won?

357
00:40:25,873 --> 00:40:29,836
Ja. Hit. -Come into my room.

358
00:40:31,754 --> 00:40:33,130
Bye.

359
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:05,954
On the first day.

360
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,916
Check-in Electric Paradise. Las Vegas.

361
00:41:11,543 --> 00:41:13,794
I met a group of people.

362
00:41:14,755 --> 00:41:18,175
Clyde and a few girls

363
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,885
who took me to him.

364
00:41:22,637 --> 00:41:24,139
Clyde's ...

365
00:41:25,764 --> 00:41:29,894
perhaps Satan seed.

366
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:33,146
Here's Johnny.

367
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:53,292
They live.

368
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,795
They live.

369
00:41:59,214 --> 00:42:03,093
Would you like something to drink? No, thank you.

370
00:42:03,761 --> 00:42:05,970
Cool. Pico we have, if you're hungry.

371
00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:08,933
Thank you. I mean, cool.

372
00:42:31,746 --> 00:42:34,541
Would you ever marry me?

373
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,837
What?

374
00:42:44,842 --> 00:42:49,680
Want to go out sometime,

375
00:42:50,014 --> 00:42:53,977
that I could show you around town? Or some cool place.

376
00:42:54,852 --> 00:42:57,771
You say that guys do not? "Cool."

377
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,401
Just ...

378
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:04,736
Tell me when ...

379
00:43:05,738 --> 00:43:07,365
I mean ...

380
00:43:09,742 --> 00:43:10,910
Of course.

381
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:22,087
Could borrow some clothes? No, thank you.

382
00:43:22,546 --> 00:43:24,047
You're crazy to see.

383
00:43:26,883 --> 00:43:27,968
Thank you.

384
00:43:28,592 --> 00:43:32,389
At least you put on this. If you keep winking, you get wrinkles.

385
00:43:32,888 --> 00:43:34,392
I accept.

386
00:43:38,144 --> 00:43:41,064
Silly you look. Thank you.

387
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,318
Are you ready? For what?

388
00:43:44,818 --> 00:43:47,737
I'm leaving. I need your recognition.

389
00:43:49,656 --> 00:43:52,324
Today will be planted in the garden or go along?

390
00:43:52,658 --> 00:43:55,494
She is not. Yes, I am.

391
00:43:58,414 --> 00:44:03,253
If I were you would be watching her every move.

392
00:44:03,461 --> 00:44:06,672
Such girls can not be trusted.

393
00:44:07,298 --> 00:44:09,759
I'll be back, I promise.

394
00:45:18,075 --> 00:45:20,870
How are you feeling tonight?

395
00:45:30,921 --> 00:45:34,175
This song is called "Zombie."

396
00:46:27,644 --> 00:46:29,896
So many times I have to pee.

397
00:46:38,946 --> 00:46:45,410
Perhaps, over time, the music and styles have changed.

398
00:46:46,662 --> 00:46:51,125
I do not know whether this is what Johnny plays, music.

399
00:46:53,251 --> 00:46:55,254
Hi, I'm Kevin.

400
00:48:53,077 --> 00:48:55,454
I'm willing to admit.

401
00:48:56,498 --> 00:48:58,332
I want to leave.

402
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:03,505
You want it, right?

403
00:49:06,007 --> 00:49:09,217
Whatever you'll figure it out. Tell me what you want!

404
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:15,098
I want the truth. Recorded over the content of blue tape.

405
00:49:15,223 --> 00:49:16,350
Tonight.

406
00:49:19,228 --> 00:49:22,356
I do not know, I'm trying to be unconscious.

407
00:49:24,525 --> 00:49:26,276
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

408
00:49:34,868 --> 00:49:38,245
Good performance. Thank you.

409
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:43,960
Can we talk about your music? It is imperative.

410
00:49:44,252 --> 00:49:47,755
You know, it is not satanic or something.

411
00:49:48,131 --> 00:49:52,344
The concept of the important things, political, comic, etc..

412
00:49:53,595 --> 00:49:55,388
Cool.

413
00:49:56,348 --> 00:50:00,351
Can we talk here? -About what?

414
00:50:01,978 --> 00:50:04,688
About something related to music.

415
00:50:06,483 --> 00:50:07,566
Of course.

416
00:50:14,782 --> 00:50:20,454
I liked because it's older brother listened to ...

417
00:50:20,746 --> 00:50:23,332
Fugazi and stuff like that.

418
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:25,751
Yeah?

419
00:50:31,423 --> 00:50:33,258
If you hold your left foot forward, it is normal.

420
00:50:33,675 --> 00:50:35,344
Another way is silly.

421
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:36,762
Are you normal or stupid?

422
00:50:37,471 --> 00:50:39,014
What?

423
00:50:39,556 --> 00:50:42,517
Are you normal or stupid? -Foolish.

424
00:50:43,226 --> 00:50:45,562
You're probably normal.

425
00:50:47,022 --> 00:50:49,942
Rachel's brother? Do not intentionally.

426
00:50:50,233 --> 00:50:51,568
Why're running?

427
00:50:51,735 --> 00:50:54,405
She got pregnant, and the father agreed to the marriage.

428
00:50:55,071 --> 00:50:59,409
She was with her boyfriend. -He does not have a boyfriend.

429
00:51:00,576 --> 00:51:03,287
Have a crush on her? What does that mean?

430
00:51:03,455 --> 00:51:05,539
You fucked my sister? No!

431
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:10,294
Who is it? I do not know. He will not say.

432
00:51:12,297 --> 00:51:16,093
Sounds like a potential movie for women.

433
00:51:17,385 --> 00:51:19,512
You guess who it was? -No.

434
00:51:20,221 --> 00:51:21,597
I did not.

435
00:51:21,764 --> 00:51:23,140
Was your father?

436
00:51:23,808 --> 00:51:26,477
He is the father fucked your sister? Shut up.

437
00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:30,857
And now he wants a husband or boyfriend to take care of her?

438
00:51:31,357 --> 00:51:32,983
Ja.

439
00:51:34,777 --> 00:51:35,903
Yes, and ...

440
00:51:36,612 --> 00:51:40,283
I learned the main chords and that was it.

441
00:51:40,908 --> 00:51:42,326
Oh, yeah.

442
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:47,707
Have you ever played a song on your phone?

443
00:51:49,291 --> 00:51:52,669
Definitely the Nintendo and Wolfensteinu.

444
00:51:54,505 --> 00:51:56,298
Maybe the phones.

445
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:03,513
I am looking for someone who eats on the phone.

446
00:52:04,264 --> 00:52:05,306
And ...

447
00:52:43,051 --> 00:52:45,805
Are you okay?

448
00:52:53,562 --> 00:52:56,649
I do not see it. Is there? Oh crisis.

449
00:52:56,732 --> 00:53:00,443
You're not watching it? I'm not his babysitter.

450
00:53:00,986 --> 00:53:03,655
Let's get out of here.

451
00:53:03,822 --> 00:53:05,949
One, two, three ...

452
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,389
I will not take it. -Take. Do not be a martyr.

453
00:53:30,556 --> 00:53:32,933
I'm not like you! Do not take drugs!

454
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:35,061
Swallow.

455
00:53:56,332 --> 00:53:58,626
Adjusted're gonna hand, right?

456
00:54:11,556 --> 00:54:13,766
Have you noticed the beautiful women here?

457
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:19,354
Home are really the sweetest spirits.

458
00:54:21,399 --> 00:54:24,526
So say ugly girls. Yeah?

459
00:54:25,109 --> 00:54:28,238
Is it good? -The tablets work.

460
00:54:29,614 --> 00:54:32,534
Father to a heart attack if they saw me like this.

461
00:54:32,618 --> 00:54:34,536
It would banish me from the village.

462
00:54:34,995 --> 00:54:36,747
You're not there anymore.

463
00:54:36,913 --> 00:54:40,542
No, I'm going back tomorrow.

464
00:54:41,334 --> 00:54:44,504
I told you, with whom you had sex.

465
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:53,930
Speak Japanese?

466
00:54:55,222 --> 00:54:58,099
Japanese spoken.

467
00:55:15,409 --> 00:55:18,287
You know I do not like it?

468
00:55:19,538 --> 00:55:22,582
And Johnny Sun Why do you say that?

469
00:55:22,999 --> 00:55:26,544
Knocked you. What?

470
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,214
You're pregnant.

471
00:55:29,088 --> 00:55:32,676
A damaged edge.

472
00:55:34,595 --> 00:55:40,642
Immaculate conceived. God's son wears.

473
00:55:41,101 --> 00:55:43,353
This little fucker.

474
00:55:45,313 --> 00:55:48,316
I told him to say "motherfucker."

475
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,244
I can show you something?

476
00:56:27,063 --> 00:56:29,648
Do you know?

477
00:56:32,151 --> 00:56:34,987
I guess the older band.

478
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:43,036
Johnny did not sing.

479
00:56:47,082 --> 00:56:50,293
You think you're pregnant with this?

480
00:56:51,378 --> 00:56:53,505
With God's son?

481
00:56:58,385 --> 00:56:59,762
Ja.

482
00:57:22,449 --> 00:57:23,743
Are you okay?

483
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,964
We'll find the guy. If you want it to.

484
00:57:39,466 --> 00:57:42,845
You want it, right? Norica.

485
00:57:45,264 --> 00:57:47,724
You do not believe me.

486
00:57:49,476 --> 00:57:52,145
* No

487
00:57:57,693 --> 00:57:59,320
Why do not you ...

488
00:58:01,697 --> 00:58:02,905
marry me?

489
00:58:06,493 --> 00:58:10,581
To reserve. If you do not find this guy.

490
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,670
But you're not the type of cassette.

491
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:20,840
If we find it,

492
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:25,261
I can leave.

493
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:31,517
You would do that? Yeah.

494
00:58:36,272 --> 00:58:37,565
well

495
00:58:37,982 --> 00:58:39,400
Good? Yeah.

496
00:58:43,529 --> 00:58:46,365
We're married. Yeah?

497
00:58:47,282 --> 00:58:49,827
Just like that? Yeah.

498
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:56,292
Did we say "I love you"?

499
00:59:01,505 --> 00:59:02,797
* No

500
00:59:05,383 --> 00:59:06,927
Maybe someday.

501
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:09,012
Yeah, maybe.

502
00:59:17,895 --> 00:59:19,940
Do not tell g. Will.

503
00:59:20,816 --> 00:59:22,817
well

504
00:59:30,784 --> 00:59:31,951
Do you know ...

505
00:59:34,579 --> 00:59:37,540
I'm not going to touch you ... In this way.

506
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:41,502
If you do not want.

507
00:59:51,012 --> 00:59:52,388
Thank you.

508
01:01:27,063 --> 01:01:28,107
Is hungry.

509
01:01:28,274 --> 01:01:31,027
Must feed our children. Go to feed him.

510
01:01:38,075 --> 01:01:40,243
All poskakujmo!

511
01:01:40,411 --> 01:01:42,246
Shut up.

512
01:01:47,919 --> 01:01:50,962
We'll bring you food. Yeah, get some food.

513
01:01:51,129 --> 01:01:53,007
So great. -Here we'll wait.

514
01:01:53,173 --> 01:01:54,633
You want to come in?

515
01:01:54,758 --> 01:01:57,677
Let's hide! Why?

516
01:01:57,844 --> 01:02:01,598
Since they would not be here. No?

517
01:02:18,573 --> 01:02:22,451
They are at home? Probably asleep.

518
01:02:23,661 --> 01:02:25,955
Is it okay that we just came in?

519
01:02:26,623 --> 01:02:30,292
Yes, as long as they do not know, it's okay.

520
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:55,066
Are yours? -No.

521
01:03:01,698 --> 01:03:04,492
I really should not.

522
01:03:41,612 --> 01:03:43,697
Can we live here?

523
01:03:50,037 --> 01:03:51,747
* No

524
01:03:55,376 --> 01:03:57,544
We will live by the sea.

525
01:04:01,172 --> 01:04:04,384
Let's go over the wall? Yeah.

526
01:04:05,052 --> 01:04:07,471
Very tall! High-'s.

527
01:04:07,638 --> 01:04:09,056
You go. One ...

528
01:04:12,517 --> 01:04:14,144
I can not.

529
01:04:18,732 --> 01:04:22,568
We have to go. -Stay here, I'll be right.

530
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:22,518
Reported to the intruder on Windhaven Circle 1533rd

531
01:06:22,685 --> 01:06:25,480
Ja. Yes, I will.

532
01:06:25,647 --> 01:06:27,398
I'm sorry.

533
01:06:32,529 --> 01:06:34,322
Young lady! Hold it!

534
01:06:34,406 --> 01:06:35,783
Hold it!

535
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:37,785
Father! -Stop!

536
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,454
It's okay. Rachel, go.

537
01:06:40,704 --> 01:06:42,288
It's okay. Nothing.

538
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,248
Go!

539
01:07:01,641 --> 01:07:02,768
Jesus.

540
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:08,439
Watch your hand. Turn around, get up.

541
01:07:08,856 --> 01:07:10,149
My shoes.

542
01:07:10,817 --> 01:07:13,319
All statements can be used against you in court.

543
01:07:13,569 --> 01:07:14,737
Head back.

544
01:07:33,714 --> 01:07:38,344
Once upon a time in the land on the other side of the red rocks ...

545
01:07:38,427 --> 01:07:39,594
Red mustang ...

546
01:08:09,082 --> 01:08:11,417
Is that girl pregnant?

547
01:08:12,418 --> 01:08:13,586
Ja.

548
01:08:13,961 --> 01:08:17,214
She's not pregnant with you, huh?

549
01:08:19,008 --> 01:08:21,427
Immaculate conceived.

550
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,472
Just trying to help her.

551
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:29,519
Clyde, I just saved you again dungeons. Do not bullshit.

552
01:08:29,685 --> 01:08:33,606
Where have you been? -Nowhere.

553
01:08:35,233 --> 01:08:38,444
Also, you must stay here. -No.

554
01:08:38,528 --> 01:08:41,530
Here you will stay or go to the workhouse.

555
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:44,824
I do not care, so ...

556
01:08:51,498 --> 01:08:53,667
Turn to the left.

557
01:09:09,516 --> 01:09:11,726
Do you have some ID?

558
01:09:15,438 --> 01:09:16,814
Driving?

559
01:09:17,774 --> 01:09:20,235
Number of soc. Insurance?

560
01:09:21,445 --> 01:09:23,238
* No

561
01:09:55,478 --> 01:09:56,854
Can I help you?

562
01:09:57,438 --> 01:10:01,733
Yes, they live here Rachel Angela McKnight. I have 15 years.

563
01:10:03,443 --> 01:10:06,446
I saw your car and ...

564
01:10:06,613 --> 01:10:10,825
I wonder ... Are you thirsty?

565
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,251
Is she cute?

566
01:10:19,418 --> 01:10:22,629
About your car questions. I think I would like to buy.

567
01:10:22,796 --> 01:10:24,047
Who is it?

568
01:10:59,581 --> 01:11:03,961
Do you recognize me? Do not think so.

569
01:11:20,561 --> 01:11:22,646
This, however.

570
01:11:24,356 --> 01:11:29,319
I'm pregnant. Whatever you did, it worked.

571
01:11:34,199 --> 01:11:38,244
Is your voice on tape? Yeah.

572
01:11:39,578 --> 01:11:41,789
And from my ex-girlfriend.

573
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:05,938
I'm really sorry.

574
01:12:10,234 --> 01:12:14,697
I can not help you. You know, financially.

575
01:12:20,661 --> 01:12:23,122
You have your mother's eyes.

576
01:12:23,914 --> 01:12:27,626
The rest of it is like me. I'm sorry.

577
01:12:32,839 --> 01:12:36,176
Shit! Even I do not know your name.

578
01:12:37,677 --> 01:12:39,511
Rachel.

579
01:12:40,514 --> 01:12:43,059
Nice name.

580
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:46,728
Rachie.

581
01:12:48,188 --> 01:12:50,649
Only Rachel. -Good.

582
01:12:55,154 --> 01:12:58,532
I am looking for a man who is singing on this tape.

583
01:12:58,698 --> 01:13:00,450
You found it.

584
01:13:01,033 --> 01:13:05,080
You're not looking for what?

585
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:15,506
Are you well acquainted with my mother?

586
01:13:18,843 --> 01:13:20,595
I loved it.

587
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:33,649
In the booth, I'm on the other side of the corridor.

588
01:13:33,816 --> 01:13:36,652
If they do not they told ... Let's try this again.

589
01:13:38,237 --> 01:13:41,324
In the booth, I'm on the other side of the corridor.

590
01:13:41,574 --> 01:13:44,659
If you do not javis,'ll be here until time immemorial.

591
01:13:44,743 --> 01:13:47,913
I know you're out there, but I had to make a call,

592
01:13:48,039 --> 01:13:52,292
do not let me wait by the phone.

593
01:13:52,459 --> 01:13:56,629
Do not let me wait by the phone.

594
01:13:57,965 --> 01:14:00,759
I have to interrupt.

595
01:14:00,926 --> 01:14:05,305
Because your voice is strange feeling ...

596
01:14:07,098 --> 01:14:10,977
Instead of finding his father the Son of God,

597
01:14:12,438 --> 01:14:14,814
I found his real father.

598
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:31,956
Hello?

599
01:14:32,164 --> 01:14:33,499
Rachel?

600
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,752
G. Will?

601
01:14:35,877 --> 01:14:37,378
Where's the Snow?

602
01:14:37,837 --> 01:14:41,883
I do not know. Where are you? -In juvie.

603
01:14:44,886 --> 01:14:46,179
Bye.

604
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:49,806
Pleased to meet you. -The same.

605
01:14:51,058 --> 01:14:58,107
Where are you going? Brother-in juvie.

606
01:14:58,773 --> 01:15:00,943
I gotta go.

607
01:15:01,776 --> 01:15:02,820
Ja.

608
01:15:09,869 --> 01:15:11,369
well

609
01:15:12,245 --> 01:15:13,622
Bye.

610
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:36,519
I like your plaster.

611
01:15:39,856 --> 01:15:41,024
Si ...

612
01:15:41,357 --> 01:15:44,277
You picked or they're blue?

613
01:15:55,996 --> 01:15:57,706
What should I do?

614
01:16:00,710 --> 01:16:01,877
I do not know.

615
01:16:07,090 --> 01:16:09,761
Should I ... Should I go back?

616
01:16:13,263 --> 01:16:14,639
I do not know.

617
01:16:29,906 --> 01:16:31,114
I ...

618
01:16:31,573 --> 01:16:33,075
I will confess.

619
01:16:34,868 --> 01:16:37,537
On the tape to officially.

620
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:43,752
They will not let me go back.

621
01:16:45,753 --> 01:16:48,631
Want to go back? Yeah.

622
01:16:50,633 --> 01:16:52,552
ben

623
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:05,023
Ja.

624
01:17:07,901 --> 01:17:09,151
Dear Clyde,

625
01:17:11,278 --> 01:17:14,448
When I was a child, I talked like a child,

626
01:17:15,033 --> 01:17:17,033
understood as a child,

627
01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:19,452
thinking like a child.

628
01:17:21,079 --> 01:17:25,251
Then I grew up and got rid of baby stuff.

629
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:29,756
For it is better, if such is God's will,

630
01:17:30,006 --> 01:17:33,091
to suffer.

631
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:36,845
Rachel.

632
01:18:22,765 --> 01:18:24,768
Thus, it is best.

633
01:18:25,643 --> 01:18:28,395
Have already been agreed.

634
01:18:30,356 --> 01:18:35,027
If I do, it will be g. Will come home?

635
01:18:38,197 --> 01:18:39,281
* No

636
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:45,662
I'm sorry.

637
01:18:52,628 --> 01:18:56,090
Behold, Mary has become one of Joseph.

638
01:18:57,383 --> 01:19:01,178
But before they lay together, she was pregnant.

639
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,599
Her husband, an ordinary man,

640
01:19:06,932 --> 01:19:10,020
did not want it repealed,

641
01:19:10,103 --> 01:19:12,480
therefore, it is sent to a hidden place.

642
01:19:13,689 --> 01:19:16,066
When thinking about

643
01:19:16,275 --> 01:19:19,528
to him in a dream an angel of the Lord appeared

644
01:19:20,071 --> 01:19:23,116
and said. "Joseph, do not be afraid,

645
01:19:23,491 --> 01:19:26,953
"For what it is started it is God's."

646
01:19:49,892 --> 01:19:52,270
I'm looking for my nephew.

647
01:19:53,187 --> 01:19:57,942
Dark blonde hair. Angelic face.

648
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:06,908
Who are you? -Friend of the family.

649
01:20:08,118 --> 01:20:11,746
Say who you are. -I was looking for your sister.

650
01:20:12,122 --> 01:20:15,916
Why? -In order to take her home.

651
01:20:16,583 --> 01:20:18,044
It's home.

652
01:20:18,336 --> 01:20:19,379
Yeah?

653
01:20:20,506 --> 01:20:22,174
I'm taking?

654
01:22:23,708 --> 01:22:25,169
This is her van!

655
01:22:42,644 --> 01:22:44,020
This is her boyfriend.

656
01:22:44,146 --> 01:22:46,273
Shit! Boy have?

657
01:22:48,316 --> 01:22:49,609
Hey.

658
01:22:55,448 --> 01:22:57,492
Who are you?

659
01:23:00,495 --> 01:23:02,747
Rachel's father.

660
01:23:05,082 --> 01:23:07,251
Fucking parents.

661
01:23:16,176 --> 01:23:18,179
God, if you're there,

662
01:23:18,554 --> 01:23:20,723
save me from this.

663
01:23:22,016 --> 01:23:24,017
Clyde should not be anyway.

664
01:23:24,894 --> 01:23:26,186
Just this once.

665
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:32,276
Sincerely yours, Rachel Angela McKnight, 15

666
01:23:38,072 --> 01:23:42,828
For the beauty of the earth.

667
01:23:43,161 --> 01:23:47,707
For the beauty of the sky.

668
01:23:48,208 --> 01:23:52,963
For the love which from our birth

669
01:23:53,338 --> 01:23:58,176
all around us.

670
01:23:58,468 --> 01:24:03,431
To you we raise to the Lord.

671
01:24:03,806 --> 01:24:09,353
It is our praise.

672
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:20,365
Heavenly Father, thank you,

673
01:24:21,323 --> 01:24:24,410
that we can witness this regard

674
01:24:24,577 --> 01:24:26,703
between Rachel Angelo

675
01:24:27,288 --> 01:24:31,333
and fair and bottom Elijahom Brooksbyjem.

676
01:24:57,901 --> 01:24:59,819
What do we do?

677
01:25:00,069 --> 01:25:02,989
Yes, we should make a plan.

678
01:25:33,936 --> 01:25:35,938
Would you go?

679
01:25:36,772 --> 01:25:41,152
You should say something. Yes, it is fitting for.

680
01:25:49,076 --> 01:25:51,495
They live.

681
01:25:58,418 --> 01:26:04,425
This is my husband, Clyde. Nice to meet you.

682
01:26:05,384 --> 01:26:08,137
They are very similar to each other.

683
01:26:19,815 --> 01:26:21,106
Rachel.

684
01:26:22,901 --> 01:26:26,653
My mother was so worried about us.

685
01:26:27,947 --> 01:26:31,784
No one will judge you if you step out of the car ...

686
01:26:44,464 --> 01:26:47,092
Was it the mother? Yeah.

687
01:26:52,346 --> 01:26:54,390
Stop! What?

688
01:26:55,724 --> 01:26:56,851
Stop.

689
01:27:06,944 --> 01:27:08,320
I'm going back.

690
01:27:08,612 --> 01:27:10,072
Wait a minute.

691
01:27:13,325 --> 01:27:14,868
Here you go.

692
01:27:59,746 --> 01:28:00,955
Testing.

693
01:28:01,581 --> 01:28:02,749
Testing.

694
01:28:04,876 --> 01:28:07,086
Here Rachel Angela McKnight.

695
01:28:08,379 --> 01:28:09,463
15 years.

696
01:28:11,215 --> 01:28:13,759
For the last time Testing.

697
01:28:14,718 --> 01:28:16,511
Some sort of recognition.

698
01:28:29,525 --> 01:28:31,151
I know who I am.

699
01:28:34,947 --> 01:28:37,867
I know that that child is the son of God.

700
01:28:39,994 --> 01:28:41,870
Inspired by Heaven.

701
01:28:45,957 --> 01:28:49,126
The world will reveal the love of God.

702
01:28:49,670 --> 01:28:50,711
And ...

703
01:28:51,003 --> 01:28:54,342
God made sure that my every step

704
01:28:54,841 --> 01:28:57,053
led to his will.

705
01:29:01,431 --> 01:29:02,599
At least I think so.

706
01:29:07,937 --> 01:29:11,232
Let's go back to the beginning.

707
01:31:16,951 --> 01:31:21,162
