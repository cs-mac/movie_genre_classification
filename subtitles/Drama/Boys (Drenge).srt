1
00:00:54,006 --> 00:00:56,167
Hey, man.
What is this having-a-picnic shit in my car?

2
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:58,836
Please, man, I'm not getting my sex at home.

3
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,675
Don't deny me this.

4
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:03,181
What are you talking about?
You sleep with a beautiful woman every night.

5
00:01:03,285 --> 00:01:05,185
I'm married. That's what married means.

6
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:07,915
It means you sleep together, but you can't get none.

7
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:14,553
Watch it with all that shit, all right?

8
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,462
Look, where's your cup holders?

9
00:01:18,602 --> 00:01:19,771
I don't have one.

10
00:01:19,924 --> 00:01:21,525
The fuck you mean you don't have one?

11
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,351
$80,000 for this car, and you ain't got no damn cup holder?

12
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:28,744
It's $105,000 and this happens to be
one of the fastest production cars on the planet.

13
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:31,977
Zero to sixty in four seconds,
sweetie. This is a limited edition.

14
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,022
You damn right it's limited. No cup holder, no backseat.

15
00:01:36,124 --> 00:01:38,491
It's a shiny dick with two chairs in it.

16
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,389
I guess we the balls just dragging the fuck along.

17
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,191
Oh, damn.

18
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:45,164
Sorry.

19
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:52,457
Get it.

20
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:54,363
If you see, I can't get down there.

21
00:01:54,178 --> 00:01:57,614
You got an engineering floor here.
My shit ain't going down up in there.

22
00:01:57,716 --> 00:02:00,810
Go. Titty-titty, strutty-strutty.

23
00:02:00,952 --> 00:02:02,648
Go on. Make them want it.

24
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,451
I ain't your wife to be cleaning up after your filthy-ass.

25
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,964
You watch my hand.
My shit can't get down there.

26
00:02:07,964 --> 00:02:10,577
And when it does, it gets stuck.
Now, what do you come up with?

27
00:02:10,744 --> 00:02:11,655
You got this shit.

28
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:13,184
Now, you're gonna get that fry.

29
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:16,050
This ain't no goddamn Denny's. Don't eat in my....

30
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,154
I wouldn't be buying
no shit from Denny's anyway.

31
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,944
I don't like the way we been treated.

32
00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:22,831
They bit, Jack. Let's skank these fools.

33
00:02:23,051 --> 00:02:25,281
Yeah... You ain't interested
in the damn fry.

34
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:26,539
You all up in that.

35
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,643
- Get out of the car, man.
- Shit.

36
00:02:28,788 --> 00:02:31,552
- What the fuck?
- Me and my team have had a big week...

37
00:02:31,656 --> 00:02:33,624
so just get the fuck out of the car.

38
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:36,475
Damn. What are you weighing, 350?

39
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:39,283
I bet you're a big Popeye's
chicken-eating motherfucker, ain't you?

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,704
- Hey. Hey.
- Get the fuck out.

41
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:43,071
- Why I always gotta get the big thick motherfuckers?
- Get the fuck out.

42
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:46,272
- Get out of the car now!
- Aight! Aight! Ok!

43
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,708
- Aight. Hold on.
- Now this is some funny shit.

44
00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:51,440
Let me tell you how bad a day you're having.

45
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:53,140
Right now, you're jacking a couple cops.

46
00:02:53,249 --> 00:02:56,377
Yeah? I'm a stand-up comedian, and I suck!

47
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,003
That's why I need your car.

48
00:02:58,402 --> 00:02:59,714
Now, I ain't no Wesley Snipes.

49
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:03,555
I just hang out with stupid-ass
friends that drive stupid-ass cars...

50
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:05,973
that attract a lot of motherfucking attention!

51
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:07,355
You know what? I need to jump over this car...

52
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:09,882
...and smack you in your peasy-ass head.
That's what I need to do.

53
00:03:10,302 --> 00:03:13,328
- You're arguing over a motherfucking French fry!
- It's not about the French fry!

54
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,908
It's about your lack of respect for other people's property!

55
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:16,887
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey!

56
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:18,850
- Shut the fuck up!
- This shit is stupid.

57
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,071
Hold the fuck on!

58
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:23,479
You want something bad enough? Come get some!

59
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:28,355
You like that shit?

60
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,087
Wesley Snipes, Passenger 57.

61
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:33,958
Now give me a motherfucking Handiwipe.

62
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:36,034
Let's hear one of those jokes, bitch.

63
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:13,347
What do you think, guys? Looks like the real thing.

64
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:15,812
You remember your assignment?

65
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:17,752
Yeah, I'm the decoy.

66
00:05:17,856 --> 00:05:19,414
Yes, you are.

67
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:28,259
What the fuck you doing?

68
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,171
Hello. Police?

69
00:05:31,273 --> 00:05:35,676
I just saw something terrible.
A policeman shot on South Miami and First Street.

70
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:37,178
Help, please.

71
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:39,215
All units, officer down.

72
00:05:39,317 --> 00:05:41,376
Officer down. Respond code three.

73
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,137
All units in the vicinity, respond and identify.

74
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,408
This is Air Unit Two. We've got a full perimeter.

75
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:11,713
Officer down. We need additional ground units.

76
00:06:18,063 --> 00:06:20,793
Air Three, roger. Suspect or suspects unknown.

77
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:28,288
Gentlemen, it's clear.

78
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,887
We're inside.

79
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:09,091
We're in.

80
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:11,066
You've got 20 minutes.

81
00:07:21,656 --> 00:07:23,783
Goddamn taco is gonna kill me.

82
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:40,474
Ok guys, you got 12 minutes.
C'mon, let's go!

83
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,835
Clear. We're in.

84
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:28,334
Move your ass. We've got six minutes.

85
00:08:30,271 --> 00:08:32,502
Ready.

86
00:08:36,836 --> 00:08:39,168
Ready to fire. Go!

87
00:08:50,303 --> 00:08:50,720
Fire!

88
00:08:54,356 --> 00:08:55,862
- Clear.
- Go.

89
00:09:08,305 --> 00:09:10,266
Come on, come on! Let's go!
Get out of here!

90
00:09:11,345 --> 00:09:13,205
Move! Move!

91
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:40,194
Damn.

92
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:42,764
Did you have sweet dreams?

93
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:47,496
You're so nasty.

94
00:09:47,604 --> 00:09:50,869
You're always saying you want quality time.

95
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:54,933
Right now, I got the time and
you damn sure got the quality.

96
00:09:56,148 --> 00:09:59,482
- Come on now.
- You know what it is?

97
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:05,090
I can't remember the last time we fell asleep together.

98
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:08,765
Baby...

99
00:10:09,963 --> 00:10:13,365
Babe, it's my job. It's what it requires.

100
00:10:13,469 --> 00:10:16,905
You know I'm a better cop
when I get some in the morning.

101
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:20,063
- I feel lighter on my feet.
- But you're gonna have to keeep it in your pants, baby.

102
00:10:20,175 --> 00:10:22,075
I hear three little Burnetts coming down the hall.

103
00:10:22,177 --> 00:10:25,614
That's cold. You're leaving me here like a humping dog.

104
00:10:27,484 --> 00:10:29,782
- Hi, baby boy.
- Mommy.

105
00:10:29,888 --> 00:10:32,427
- Hey, boy, what's up?
- Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

106
00:10:36,662 --> 00:10:40,497
Dad, at school, people say I look weird.

107
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:42,796
They say my ears look funny.

108
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:45,770
Boy, your daddy has that same problem. I got the ears.

109
00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:49,401
You know what? They just out there
for you to listen to people's problems.

110
00:10:49,512 --> 00:10:51,742
You're an angel. These are your wings.

111
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:53,338
That's all.

112
00:10:53,483 --> 00:10:55,542
James, stop. Would you take them off...

113
00:10:55,652 --> 00:10:58,519
Your ears are better for you to listen with.

114
00:10:58,622 --> 00:11:00,681
Don't let me come down to school.
I'll arrest the principal.

115
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,692
- Mom, mom!
- What?

116
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,589
- James keeps pushing me! Quit! Quit!
- Talking about my boy's ears.

117
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,491
- Uncle Mike's in the house.
- What's up, Uncle Mike?

118
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,467
- Partner, partner.
- What's going on?

119
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,004
- Hey, Quincy, check it out.

120
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,356
- What? What? What?
- Hey, why did you take my food for?

121
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:16,283
Hey, girl.

122
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:19,530
Ooh, don't kiss me, Mike. I don't know
where your lips were last night. Move.

123
00:11:21,484 --> 00:11:23,816
Uncle Mike, did you have a date last night?

124
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,820
Oooh... Did I?!

125
00:11:25,922 --> 00:11:28,619
- Let me tell you, boy. This girl was...
- Hey!

126
00:11:28,726 --> 00:11:31,524
Don't tell my son your sleazy sex stories.

127
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,095
- I only tell your husband my sleazy sex stories.
- Hey!

128
00:11:35,234 --> 00:11:37,632
I don't want him knowing about
them either; gives him ideas.

129
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:40,261
Why you putting me in this? I'm with my babies.

130
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:43,468
- Ok? Thank you.
- Hello?

131
00:11:43,576 --> 00:11:46,340
- Eat. Go on, girl.
- No problem.

132
00:11:51,284 --> 00:11:54,448
- You're on the mike with Mike.
- Want Daddy to wipe your mouth?

133
00:11:54,555 --> 00:11:58,582
I think you mean to say, "Get our
asses down there, please, " Captain.

134
00:11:58,695 --> 00:12:01,596
- <i>Now! </i>
- Maybe not.

135
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:10,372
What's up, boy?

136
00:12:11,776 --> 00:12:15,143
- Hey, baby!
- Hey, Francine. Where's Howard?

137
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:18,412
He's down there. He's looking
for you. He's been in better moods.

138
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:23,657
Ahh... Damn.

139
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:25,221
Get it done, goddamn it.

140
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:28,461
Welcome to our nightmare, boys.

141
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:34,060
See this? What's wrong with this picture?

142
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,070
Remember this room?

143
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,008
These flats.
They look familiar, don't they?

144
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:42,568
There were these silver packets. They looked like bricks.

145
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,115
Little red tags on them, about so high.

146
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:47,015
- All that heroin is gone.
- This was our career bust...

147
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,179
worth $100 million.

148
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:51,621
- Gone.
- This is bad.

149
00:12:51,726 --> 00:12:54,251
No, let me call it what it is. This is fucked up.

150
00:12:54,361 --> 00:12:58,025
- You got that right, detective.
- Hello, Alison.

151
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:01,967
You guys know Captain Sinclair,
Internal Affairs' top watchdog.

152
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:04,902
I'd actually take that as a compliment
if I didn't know you so well.

153
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:09,409
Excuse me, but if you two want to
get personal, I could step out...

154
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:12,241
There's nothing personal here. I'm just doing my job.

155
00:13:12,349 --> 00:13:13,782
I love knowing that one leak...

156
00:13:13,884 --> 00:13:17,285
one headline could turn this nightmare into a media frenzy.

157
00:13:17,388 --> 00:13:21,155
That won't happen. We'll get the
dope back before that ever happens.

158
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,954
Good. Start by looking right here.

159
00:13:23,062 --> 00:13:26,998
This had to be an inside job, and I'll find out about it.

160
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,130
Sanchez, Ruiz, you're late.

161
00:13:32,672 --> 00:13:36,439
Somebody put this in for toxic drug fumes.

162
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:38,410
Yeah, this was a brilliant design.

163
00:13:38,513 --> 00:13:40,640
This was really intelligent. I like this.

164
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:43,515
I didn't ask how he feels. I said, "What did he see?"

165
00:13:43,619 --> 00:13:45,553
What does he know?

166
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,559
Where were y'all last night?

167
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:51,991
Listen, why don't ya'll have your cousins
bring the shit back, and we can all get some sleep.

168
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,998
We were gonna do that, but we came up with a problem.

169
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:57,433
Your mama snorted up all the dope.

170
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,165
You two, get over there.

171
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:04,336
O'Fee will be all right, but he's got nothing to tell us.

172
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:08,007
So they kill a decoy, it empties the station. Very smart.

173
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:11,553
But they don't kill a real cop because
they had the whole force on their ass.

174
00:14:11,653 --> 00:14:14,486
This was your case. You're back on it.

175
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:17,992
Sanchez, Ruiz, you back them up with whatever they need.

176
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:20,689
- Shut your mouths.
- But wait a second.

177
00:14:20,798 --> 00:14:22,891
It was Carrera's drugs in the first place.

178
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:25,163
But it couldn't have been him
because he was killed in prison.

179
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:27,068
What about the rest of his crew?

180
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:29,139
Those idiots don't have the precision to do this, but...

181
00:14:29,274 --> 00:14:31,538
just in case I'm wrong, you check them out.

182
00:14:31,643 --> 00:14:35,670
They'd have been up here with Uzis,
splashing O'Fee all over the place.

183
00:14:35,815 --> 00:14:37,511
Takes a lot of brains to pull this off.

184
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,609
- Big cojones too.
- What the hell are you talking about? "Cojones"?

185
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,725
It would take me a month to explain to you what cojones is.

186
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:46,851
- You're in Miami. You don't know...
- In English.

187
00:14:47,332 --> 00:14:49,959
Ho! Ho! <i>Hey!</i>
We've got nothing.

188
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,633
What's the matter with you? We've got nothing!

189
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,905
The guy who pulled this off knew what he was doing...

190
00:14:56,007 --> 00:14:58,407
and he left us nothing but a big "Fuck you."

191
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:03,501
Ruiz, Sanchez, find out who installed
the ventilating system. Do that now.

192
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:08,745
- That's cold. 
- Yeah, so is your mama's bed.

193
00:15:08,854 --> 00:15:11,152
This could definitely be an inside job. Don't rule it out.

194
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:15,927
We've got 72 hours before the FBI and the DEA...

195
00:15:16,032 --> 00:15:19,433
walk in here and shut us down, and we'll be the bad guys.

196
00:15:19,535 --> 00:15:22,561
Politics demand that somebody take the rap for this.

197
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:27,974
It's going to be us. Just do what you do, only faster.

198
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,774
Jo Jo, what's up?

199
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,940
You're still a chemist, right?
Cutting drugs and shit like that?

200
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:36,953
I don't know nothing about that.
I'm out of the drug business.

201
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:39,083
- You know something.
- You don't know nothing?

202
00:15:39,226 --> 00:15:40,989
I just said no to drugs.

203
00:15:41,094 --> 00:15:45,394
- What are you into, Jo?
- Rubber, rubber, rubber.

204
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,799
- You're selling tires? - Yeah.

205
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:52,898
- Jo Jo don't know nothing.
- Nothing. I know tires.

206
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:56,443
- You're telling me the truth, right?
- Would I lie to you?

207
00:15:56,577 --> 00:15:58,306
- Would you lie to me?
- I'm driving.

208
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,120
- Man, this is a waste of time.
- Come on, man.

209
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:12,719
In Max's line of work, she definitely gets the 411.

210
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:16,459
Maxi! How did I know I would find you up in here?

211
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,840
We have to talk. Is there someplace we can go?

212
00:16:22,977 --> 00:16:24,604
Yeah. Equipment room?

213
00:16:24,746 --> 00:16:26,941
- Behave yourself.
- I'm cool.

214
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:41,055
Listen, I need some help, again.

215
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,657
What else is new?

216
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:58,175
Major ill shit happened down at the police department.

217
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:01,017
There's a lot of heroin involved.
There will be a lot of cash involved.

218
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:04,389
There will definitely be some jolly young
men running around who want to party.

219
00:17:04,494 --> 00:17:06,018
What do you need?

220
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:08,530
A lot of people will talk to you that won't talk to me.

221
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:11,569
You mean customers?

222
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,195
I'm not asking you to get into any wild shit.

223
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:18,605
- Just call me if you hear something.
- I think I will call you.

224
00:17:28,054 --> 00:17:30,545
What the hell are you doing?

225
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:32,627
Trying to keep my shit quick.

226
00:17:32,728 --> 00:17:34,218
That's right. You ain't getting none at home.

227
00:17:34,363 --> 00:17:36,729
You got extra energy. Go ahead. Burn it off, baby.

228
00:17:39,002 --> 00:17:40,697
We got anything, Francine?

229
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:43,397
Sanchez says the air-conditioning contract went...

230
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:46,099
- to Manuel Arrona of Key Biscayne.
- Partner.

231
00:17:46,244 --> 00:17:50,237
He's working out of his house this week. That's the number.

232
00:17:57,225 --> 00:17:59,090
He's not answering.

233
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:01,423
I guess we should just leave.

234
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:05,522
What? Make a trip all the way down
here to high society for nothing?

235
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,259
That's why they have windows.

236
00:18:07,402 --> 00:18:09,267
- We can peek in. - Yeah, that should do it.

237
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:17,113
- I tripped.
- The handle just opened?

238
00:18:17,248 --> 00:18:18,943
Right after I tripped, it just opened.

239
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:23,283
I guess they want us to come in, take a peek.

240
00:18:23,423 --> 00:18:25,618
Hello?

241
00:18:25,726 --> 00:18:28,092
We're your new neighbors.

242
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:30,720
Don't be alarmed. We're Negroes.

243
00:18:30,831 --> 00:18:33,629
Man, there's too much bass in your voice.

244
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:36,226
That scares white folks. You've got to sound like them.

245
00:18:36,372 --> 00:18:39,967
We were wondering if we could borrow some brown sugar?

246
00:18:46,614 --> 00:18:49,311
- You fart?
- No, man...

247
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,052
Dead guy.

248
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:05,334
Looks like somebody's home.

249
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:18,181
Let me take a stab at this one.

250
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:20,881
He sells the ventilation plans to the bad guys.

251
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,357
- He gets rich, but he gets dead.
- You're right on that one.

252
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,487
- I'll go call Homicide.
- Whoa. Wait.

253
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,726
Why do you act like this every
time we're around a dead body?

254
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,303
It's cool. I just...

255
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,565
Please, look around.

256
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,403
The smell and the fumes...

257
00:19:38,514 --> 00:19:40,414
It's just unexpected, that's all.

258
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,924
Looks like our buddy Arrona was a bit of a gambler.

259
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:54,894
He's got dog track, jai alai.

260
00:19:54,964 --> 00:19:56,761
Probably needed the money to pay off his debts.

261
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:58,266
Bookie.

262
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,567
- Whoops.
- Damn, man.

263
00:20:03,709 --> 00:20:05,506
Watch where you're swinging a dead leg.

264
00:20:05,611 --> 00:20:07,078
My bad.

265
00:20:07,182 --> 00:20:09,844
Damn this. I'm calling Homicide.

266
00:20:09,948 --> 00:20:11,813
I'm a narcotics cop.

267
00:20:14,688 --> 00:20:16,816
Dead bodies.

268
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:20,419
Dead ends.

269
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:28,469
Maggots.

270
00:20:31,575 --> 00:20:35,272
- What's wrong with you?
- A little nauseous...

271
00:20:35,379 --> 00:20:39,509
I'm gonna...

272
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:49,188
What do you say we grab a couple burritos?

273
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:55,467
You drive almost slow enough to drive Miss Daisy.

274
00:20:57,907 --> 00:21:00,899
Man, the transaction is done, all right?

275
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,410
- We ain't got shit, so it's over.
- Relax.

276
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,982
We got it before. We'll get it again.

277
00:21:06,085 --> 00:21:08,645
Yeah, you got it all figured out, don't you?

278
00:21:08,754 --> 00:21:10,483
You got to have faith, player.

279
00:21:10,623 --> 00:21:14,115
By the time we figured out how, we'd be out of a job.

280
00:21:14,227 --> 00:21:18,665
No, scratch that. Everybody in
the damn unit will be out of a job.

281
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:23,760
But don't worry. They tend to
think Mike Lowrey will be all right.

282
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:28,035
Especially since they think you some rich kid playing cop.

283
00:21:28,143 --> 00:21:31,477
Look, man, I ain't got no trust fund.

284
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:35,019
For me: No job, no check.

285
00:21:35,116 --> 00:21:39,212
That's like all the other guys in the unit. Most of us.

286
00:21:39,321 --> 00:21:41,346
So I'm playing cop now?

287
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,787
This is a game. I'm just joking around.

288
00:21:44,896 --> 00:21:47,364
You always wanted to be Starsky or Hutch.

289
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:54,201
Know what? I'm so sick of this bullshit.

290
00:21:54,307 --> 00:21:57,835
I'm supposed to apologize for
my family leaving me money?

291
00:21:57,946 --> 00:22:00,540
All I ever wanted to be was a cop.

292
00:22:00,682 --> 00:22:03,150
I get up early and take it to the max every day.

293
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:06,550
I'm the first guy through the door
and the last to leave the crime scene...

294
00:22:06,655 --> 00:22:08,886
so fuck you and fuck them...

295
00:22:08,992 --> 00:22:12,223
and fuck everybody who got a problem with Mike Lowrey.

296
00:22:14,498 --> 00:22:16,966
- I love you, man.
- Fuck you, Marcus.

297
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:23,732
I do. You're cool with me. You're my partner.

298
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:27,007
Shut up. Slow-ass driver.

299
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:29,014
- Driving like a bitch.
- Why I got to be all that?

300
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:33,244
- Slow-ass Miss Daisy.
- I'll take me and you off this cliff...

301
00:22:33,355 --> 00:22:34,914
you keep fucking with me.

302
00:22:35,024 --> 00:22:37,424
Then it will be two bitches in the sea.

303
00:22:37,526 --> 00:22:40,586
- Is that what you want?
- Shut up.

304
00:22:40,697 --> 00:22:43,632
My wife know I ain't no bitch.

305
00:22:44,735 --> 00:22:46,430
- Yeah.
- I'm a bad boy.

306
00:22:46,537 --> 00:22:50,303
Bad boys, bad boys What you gonna do

307
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,208
What you gonna do when they come for you

308
00:22:53,312 --> 00:22:55,439
Shelly, only models, and that's all.

309
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:57,311
Max just dropped by. I have to go.

310
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,181
Bye.

311
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:04,114
You want me to call around looking for the newly rich?

312
00:23:04,224 --> 00:23:08,320
Are there any new guys partying
a lot, spending a lot of money?

313
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,624
Actually, this guy called me this morning, desperate...

314
00:23:10,731 --> 00:23:12,632
every two hours... looking for new girls in town.

315
00:23:12,735 --> 00:23:14,225
Are you available this afternoon?

316
00:23:14,337 --> 00:23:17,500
- It will be a quick $2,000.
- I've got plans with Julie.

317
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:19,633
- She's your roommate, right?
- Yeah.

318
00:23:19,742 --> 00:23:22,142
Bring her. She's cute. She's sexy. Go on.

319
00:23:22,245 --> 00:23:25,807
- She's not a working girl, Lois.
- Doesn't matter. He's on speedballs.

320
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:28,317
He's probably so messed up, he can't even get it up.

321
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:30,480
Maybe we'll go check it out.

322
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:32,955
It could be the party I'm looking for.

323
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:36,654
A party at the Biltmore?
That will really rock.

324
00:23:36,763 --> 00:23:39,324
- Julie, I owe you one.
- Forget about it.

325
00:23:39,435 --> 00:23:42,336
I'll just deduct it from the hundreds
off avors I already owe you.

326
00:23:42,438 --> 00:23:44,998
Am I turning into the guest that won't leave?

327
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:47,507
I like having you live with me.

328
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:50,511
I'm an out-of-work photographer
who doesn't know how to cook.

329
00:23:50,614 --> 00:23:53,447
- Not a big upside for you there.
- Come on.

330
00:23:53,551 --> 00:23:57,681
What incredibly hip individual
inspired this visit to the Biltmore?

331
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:00,019
- It's a favor for Mike Lowrey.
- Right.

332
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:03,027
The cop who I think you may be a little bit in love with.

333
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,530
Maybe I am, but we're just friends.

334
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:10,194
And if I were ever in trouble, he's
the only person I would call.

335
00:24:10,305 --> 00:24:13,297
I know. I think I've heard this before.

336
00:24:14,643 --> 00:24:17,476
- Hello.
- Hi.

337
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,912
You must be Max.

338
00:24:20,016 --> 00:24:21,916
Welcome. I'm Eddie.

339
00:24:22,018 --> 00:24:24,213
The Al Capone suite.

340
00:24:24,322 --> 00:24:28,760
- I guess we're a little early.
- This is my friend, Julie.

341
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:34,992
You like Al Capone, don't you?

342
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,999
I hadn't really thought about it much.

343
00:24:38,836 --> 00:24:41,499
I'm not kidding about this being Capone's.

344
00:24:41,608 --> 00:24:45,601
He had the place rigged with secret passageways.

345
00:24:45,712 --> 00:24:47,612
Ten minutes, we're out of here.

346
00:24:47,716 --> 00:24:49,741
- Five.
- Julie, one drink.

347
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,442
- What's the whispering about?
- One sip.

348
00:24:51,553 --> 00:24:53,249
It's Eddie here.

349
00:24:53,357 --> 00:24:55,086
Just girl chat.

350
00:24:55,192 --> 00:24:57,387
Where's the bathroom?

351
00:24:57,493 --> 00:24:59,358
Upstairs on your right.

352
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:02,522
Watch your step.

353
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:07,270
Come. Sit.

354
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:09,431
Enjoy yourself. Relax.

355
00:25:09,543 --> 00:25:12,535
Eddie's got some favors to play with.

356
00:25:12,646 --> 00:25:14,876
Yes, Eddie does.

357
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:17,610
I should have told you sooner about Eddie's private party.

358
00:25:17,718 --> 00:25:21,449
Now it's a surprise party.

359
00:25:27,397 --> 00:25:31,960
Okay, Max, we've been here about five minutes too long.

360
00:25:37,342 --> 00:25:40,311
I see you treat yourself well, Eddie.

361
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:42,813
Yeah.

362
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,480
I needed to blow off a little steam
after the move, you know?

363
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:53,789
So a little party with a couple of friends. That's all.

364
00:25:53,893 --> 00:25:57,022
I was gonna invite you guys.

365
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,998
Invite? It looks like I'm catering this.

366
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:06,329
I was looking for my two keys of dope,
and now I know where they are.

367
00:26:06,442 --> 00:26:08,343
Yours? It's our score.

368
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,347
- And the girl?
- Nobody.

369
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:17,149
- Just entertainment.
- Hi, I'm Max.

370
00:26:17,257 --> 00:26:18,952
Nice to meet you, Max.

371
00:26:20,995 --> 00:26:25,295
I like a woman who takes pride in her appearance.

372
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:29,534
Don't you?

373
00:26:29,638 --> 00:26:33,302
Yeah, I hate when a bitch lets herself slide.

374
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:36,311
You look like a model in that dress.

375
00:26:36,413 --> 00:26:37,812
Will you model for me, Max?

376
00:26:45,023 --> 00:26:48,050
Great. It's the goon squad.

377
00:27:15,292 --> 00:27:18,193
You were a cop for so long, you should know hookers talk.

378
00:27:18,295 --> 00:27:21,321
You couldn't wait four more days until I made the deal?

379
00:27:21,465 --> 00:27:23,764
I can't work with that kind of stupidity!

380
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:27,703
Stupidity? I got you connected inside!

381
00:27:28,808 --> 00:27:31,299
I brought you my family.

382
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:35,711
Eddie, it's my family now.

383
00:27:37,185 --> 00:27:40,120
Fouchet, we're still friends.

384
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,656
- What are you guys doing?
- You pissed him off.

385
00:27:45,594 --> 00:27:47,721
Use a smaller gun. You got blood on me again.

386
00:27:47,831 --> 00:27:51,734
- Hey, somebody's up there. Upstairs.
- Where? Go!

387
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:54,671
Get her! Move, Fergie!

388
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:10,990
Get her!

389
00:28:11,126 --> 00:28:12,889
What the fuck?

390
00:28:16,298 --> 00:28:18,858
Fucking shoes suck! Get her!

391
00:28:18,969 --> 00:28:21,904
- God!
- Move it!

392
00:28:28,314 --> 00:28:29,508
Go!

393
00:28:31,652 --> 00:28:33,677
Shoot her!

394
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:53,370
- I got her. Bullshit.
- I got her.

395
00:28:53,476 --> 00:28:56,206
No, I got her. What do you know about shooting?

396
00:28:56,313 --> 00:28:58,247
I can't believe she made it.

397
00:28:58,347 --> 00:29:00,440
- Jesus.
- Are you serious?

398
00:29:00,551 --> 00:29:03,247
- She jumped.
- Fuck.

399
00:29:04,322 --> 00:29:07,723
Find out who she worked for and where she lives.

400
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:22,076
It's about fucking time. Lowrey, Burnett, come here!

401
00:29:22,212 --> 00:29:24,942
Look at this. You see this guy?

402
00:29:25,047 --> 00:29:26,674
- He's dead, right?
- Yeah.

403
00:29:26,782 --> 00:29:29,080
- He look familiar?
- Eddie Dominguez.

404
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:31,279
- The ex-cop.
- Two points for you.

405
00:29:31,388 --> 00:29:33,788
There's some of our high-grade heroin over there.

406
00:29:33,892 --> 00:29:36,725
Sinclair will love that headline.

407
00:29:36,828 --> 00:29:38,762
There's no signs of forced entry.

408
00:29:38,865 --> 00:29:41,459
What the fuck is all this? It looks like Beirut.

409
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:43,229
It's the Al Capone suite.

410
00:29:43,338 --> 00:29:45,499
What can I say? Shit happens.

411
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,406
This is a real shitty day.

412
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:52,639
Looks like we have two shades of lipstick here, gentlemen.

413
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:54,773
Somebody is missing from the party.

414
00:29:54,884 --> 00:29:56,351
Listen to me.

415
00:29:56,486 --> 00:30:00,388
Your only function in life right now
is to find that person. Find her.

416
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,651
It's the only good lead we got all day.

417
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,194
Man, I'll check all calls to the room.

418
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:18,375
What you got over there, partner?

419
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:31,257
Cover her.

420
00:30:34,765 --> 00:30:36,460
He knew the girl?

421
00:30:49,282 --> 00:30:51,216
Look, man...

422
00:30:51,318 --> 00:30:54,253
we'll get the witness and the fools who did this.

423
00:30:54,387 --> 00:30:57,789
Yeah. Listen, catch a ride with Howard.

424
00:30:57,927 --> 00:31:01,192
- Where you going?
- Eight calls were made to Lois Fields.

425
00:31:01,296 --> 00:31:03,662
That's who Max used to work for. I'll check that out.

426
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:06,894
- I'll come with you.
- I'm all right. We'll catch up later.

427
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:11,270
- You okay?
- I'm cool.

428
00:31:19,118 --> 00:31:26,173
Hello? Hello?
Hello?

429
00:31:26,828 --> 00:31:28,227
Shit.

430
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:37,232
Yeah, baby. Look, I know quality time was my idea.

431
00:31:37,338 --> 00:31:40,398
- <i>Don't talk about quality time.</i>
- But... Hold on, baby.

432
00:31:40,508 --> 00:31:43,739
Look here, I need a full file on Eddie Dominguez.

433
00:31:43,847 --> 00:31:45,542
- <i>That will take a minute.</i>

- Hold on.

434
00:31:45,682 --> 00:31:47,548
- <i>Marcus, I got on the red one.</i>
- Baby?

435
00:31:47,653 --> 00:31:50,417
You have on the red one? The one with the snaps?

436
00:31:50,521 --> 00:31:52,546
- Why couldn't you wait till...
- <i>You're never home.</i>

437
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:54,886
- Theresa... Hold on.
- <i>All his files are blocked.</i>

438
00:31:55,028 --> 00:31:57,462
I don't give a damn about his personal files.

439
00:31:57,563 --> 00:32:01,022
- The man's dead. Unblock it.
- <i>Screw you. That's illegal.</i>

440
00:32:01,168 --> 00:32:02,567
Screw you!

441
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:06,769
- Fucking...
- <i>Marcus, are you talking to me?</i>

442
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:09,935
I'm not talking to... It's a term you use, baby.

443
00:32:10,046 --> 00:32:12,777
- "Screw you" is a cop term.
- <i>You ain't screwing nothing!</i>

444
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:15,680
Theresa...
Goddamn it!

445
00:32:19,056 --> 00:32:20,990
Where's Lowrey?

446
00:32:21,093 --> 00:32:22,583
I just paged him.

447
00:32:22,727 --> 00:32:25,195
He's following up this Lois Fields lead.

448
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:26,695
The madam?

449
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:45,884
21-2, request backup. 614 Reach Road.

450
00:33:16,492 --> 00:33:17,982
Don't mess with us.

451
00:33:19,595 --> 00:33:20,323
That might be him.

452
00:33:24,134 --> 00:33:26,125
Yeah. Lowrey's desk.

453
00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:29,171
I need to talk to Detective Mike Lowrey.

454
00:33:29,306 --> 00:33:31,001
This is Captain Howard. Can I help you?

455
00:33:31,108 --> 00:33:33,872
You can get me Lowrey.

456
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:35,947
This is not another paternity case, is it?

457
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:39,107
No, it's another murder case, you twerp.

458
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:41,846
Are you talking about the murder
case at the Biltmore Hotel tonight?

459
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:46,086
Listen, I've just seen my best friend get murdered...

460
00:33:46,194 --> 00:33:49,357
and I'll only talk to Mike Lowrey.

461
00:33:49,464 --> 00:33:51,557
Why only Mike Lowrey? I have a detective here...

462
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:53,600
None of your fucking business.

463
00:33:53,703 --> 00:33:56,171
Either I talk to Lowrey
or I'm gonna blow town.

464
00:33:56,306 --> 00:33:58,331
Mike, telephone!

465
00:33:58,441 --> 00:34:01,877
He's coming right now. Hold on, please.

466
00:34:02,013 --> 00:34:04,538
- Talk to her.
- Captain, I ain't got time for these games.

467
00:34:04,682 --> 00:34:07,015
This is the witness, the girl at the hotel.

468
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,556
Yeah, he just got out of the john. Hold on. Talk to her.

469
00:34:10,658 --> 00:34:13,718
- If you don't talk to her, she'll walk.
- Captain, I can't be Mike.

470
00:34:13,861 --> 00:34:15,419
Just talk to her now. She's gonna walk.

471
00:34:15,563 --> 00:34:17,724
- This is our witness.
- Calm down.

472
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:26,241
Hello. This is Mike Lowrey.

473
00:34:27,509 --> 00:34:30,740
He doesn't talk that way. Try to talk sexy.

474
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,746
- Come on, come on.
- You don't sound sexy enough.

475
00:34:32,883 --> 00:34:35,545
Captain! I'm in there!

476
00:34:36,688 --> 00:34:41,387
You don't know me. My name's Julie Mott.

477
00:34:41,492 --> 00:34:43,586
I was Max Logan's best friend.

478
00:34:43,696 --> 00:34:47,257
Whoa. Calm down. Talk to me now.

479
00:34:49,202 --> 00:34:53,969
- Yeah.
- She said if she ever needed anything...

480
00:34:56,245 --> 00:34:58,213
I need your help.

481
00:34:58,314 --> 00:35:01,772
Give me the address. All right.

482
00:35:01,918 --> 00:35:04,409
It's gonna be all right. Mike's to the rescue.

483
00:35:04,554 --> 00:35:07,284
- I'm on the way. All right.
- I'll see if I can find Lowrey.

484
00:35:07,423 --> 00:35:08,891
- I can't go.
- You have to go.

485
00:35:09,026 --> 00:35:11,620
- Go!
- Get Mike down here to handle this.

486
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:14,290
Get to this address now. Get out of the chair.

487
00:35:14,432 --> 00:35:15,815
You won't see your wife for a month!

488
00:35:15,815 --> 00:35:18,615
- Get out of the chair!
- Goddamn it, man.

489
00:35:30,452 --> 00:35:32,420
Get this fucking door fixed.

490
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,400
Mike Lowrey.

491
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:44,866
Easy. Mike Lowrey.

492
00:35:46,706 --> 00:35:48,196
Shit.

493
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:53,704
- Who's there?
- Mike Lowrey.

494
00:35:53,812 --> 00:35:55,780
How do I know it's Mike Lowrey?

495
00:35:55,882 --> 00:35:58,442
'Cause I'm Mike Lowrey.

496
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:00,347
We ain't got much time.

497
00:36:00,487 --> 00:36:02,785
Hold your badge up to the peephole.

498
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:05,723
I'm not letting you in until you do!

499
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:14,695
No way.

500
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,675
- What the fuck was that for?
- You're not Mike Lowrey!

501
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:22,575
What do you mean? You never even met him... <i>me</i>.

502
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,549
- Max described you differently!
- I'm undercover!

503
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,482
- All right!
- Prove it!

504
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,884
I knew Max from way back.

505
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:33,015
- I helped her brother get out of jail.
- Yeah, so?

506
00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:37,564
So, from time to time, we'd get
together, a little bump and grind.

507
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:40,397
- Wrong.
- Give me that!

508
00:36:40,536 --> 00:36:44,597
Give me the bat! You want to go out? Fine!

509
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:46,767
You don't want to believe me, you go at this shit alone!

510
00:36:48,678 --> 00:36:53,275
Oh, I forgot! The bad guys
 probably know where you live.

511
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:55,979
Which means they're coming for your ass. Good luck.

512
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:00,686
I saw the whole thing.

513
00:37:01,963 --> 00:37:05,057
I watched them shoot her like she was nothing.

514
00:37:07,971 --> 00:37:09,370
Please shut the door.

515
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:16,974
Look, lady...

516
00:37:17,078 --> 00:37:19,478
...you ain't got no more bats, golf clubs...

517
00:37:19,581 --> 00:37:23,540
or anything like that you could swing at me?

518
00:37:23,653 --> 00:37:25,712
I knew Max.

519
00:37:25,822 --> 00:37:30,453
I care about Max also.

520
00:37:30,562 --> 00:37:33,463
I'm just here to help you.

521
00:37:35,701 --> 00:37:37,362
You're not what I expected.

522
00:37:38,704 --> 00:37:41,868
I didn't expect to walk into Yankee Stadium either.

523
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:48,744
Now, we have to get out of here. Let's go.

524
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,477
I have to get my dogs. Come here, Dukie.

525
00:37:50,585 --> 00:37:53,487
Come here, Lukie, Dukie, whatever.

526
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:56,024
You got a back door?

527
00:37:56,126 --> 00:37:57,684
Where are we going?
Duke. Come here, Dukie.

528
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:01,960
- Protective custody.
- Fuck that. I'm only dealing with you.

529
00:38:02,067 --> 00:38:04,831
That was a cop that threw that
little party back at the Biltmore.

530
00:38:04,938 --> 00:38:07,873
Former cop. We got rid of him a long time ago.

531
00:38:07,973 --> 00:38:10,066
- Come on, Luke.
- Listen, lady.

532
00:38:10,177 --> 00:38:13,408
If you want to live, you ain't got
no choice. You got to trust me.

533
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,383
- My God!
- Go! Go!

534
00:38:22,726 --> 00:38:23,715
Move!

535
00:38:31,338 --> 00:38:32,862
Run!

536
00:38:45,452 --> 00:38:48,888
- Get the dog!
- Here, doggie!

537
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:52,015
Jesus Christ! Who the hell was that?

538
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:55,857
- Let's go!
- There is too much killing going on!

539
00:38:55,964 --> 00:38:58,592
- Go after them! I'll go around front!
- I got them!

540
00:39:00,836 --> 00:39:04,670
Come on! Move your ass! Let's go!

541
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:09,469
Fuck.

542
00:39:20,662 --> 00:39:23,825
- Get in the car! 
- Damn it.

543
00:39:28,404 --> 00:39:31,464
- Go, goddamn it! 
- Fucking door!

544
00:39:40,185 --> 00:39:44,087
How did you miss them? You fat fuck!

545
00:39:44,189 --> 00:39:45,817
Watch your fucking mouth!

546
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:47,757
If you'd lose some weight, you would have caught them!

547
00:39:47,861 --> 00:39:50,591
I'd like to squeeze your little fucking head, you bastard!

548
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:52,667
You're in trouble!
Now you're in fucking trouble!

549
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:55,132
- You get the license plate?
- Yeah, I got the fucking plates.

550
00:39:55,236 --> 00:39:56,726
You cockeyed fuck.

551
00:39:57,872 --> 00:39:59,670
This is your
goddamn getaway car?

552
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:03,541
We won't get away from anything in this.
Is this a goddamn family station wagon?

553
00:40:03,646 --> 00:40:06,513
My God, you have a baby seat in the back.

554
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:09,311
It's an undercover car. Undercover!

555
00:40:09,418 --> 00:40:12,286
Shit! I know they got a look at my license plate.

556
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,187
Were those the guys who shot Max?

557
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:15,782
What guys? I only saw bullets.

558
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:17,417
You tell me what they looked like.

559
00:40:17,527 --> 00:40:20,428
I don't know! I was too busy trying
to keep a bullet out your ass!

560
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:24,024
Julie, I'll need you to look through some mug shots...

561
00:40:24,136 --> 00:40:26,127
until you can identify Max's shooter.

562
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:28,264
- Where will we do that?
- Protective custody.

563
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:31,606
No way! I told you I am not going into protective custody!

564
00:40:31,712 --> 00:40:34,806
Look, lady, I'm not playing. You're really pissing me off!

565
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:36,475
I'll book your narrow ass!

566
00:40:36,585 --> 00:40:38,382
Yeah? I'll develop amnesia.

567
00:40:38,488 --> 00:40:41,355
I suddenly feel a little case of it coming on right now.

568
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:44,291
Fine, lady. Where would you feel safe?

569
00:40:44,394 --> 00:40:46,624
You want to do protective custody?

570
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,426
We'll do in-home protective custody.

571
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:51,366
At your place, all right? I can handle going to your place.

572
00:40:51,469 --> 00:40:52,993
Yeah, my place.

573
00:40:53,105 --> 00:40:55,630
My place is... No way.

574
00:40:57,577 --> 00:41:02,038
Right. My place. Yeah, my place's the shit.

575
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:05,017
Mike Lowrey place. You right.

576
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,145
That's the best idea you came up with tonight.

577
00:41:11,894 --> 00:41:14,227
Wait here. Wait <i>here</i>.

578
00:41:20,205 --> 00:41:23,538
- Detective Burnett, how are you? Long time no see.
- I'm cool.

579
00:41:23,642 --> 00:41:25,507
- Mr. Lowrey's not here. He's out.
- I know.

580
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:27,443
- He said I could use his place tonight.
- Really?

581
00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:29,642
He didn't mention it to me.

582
00:41:32,553 --> 00:41:35,078
Who's the chick? How's your wife?

583
00:41:36,956 --> 00:41:38,583
She's fine.

584
00:41:38,691 --> 00:41:40,091
Your kids are good?

585
00:41:40,194 --> 00:41:43,186
- Family's the most important thing.
- Is it?

586
00:41:43,298 --> 00:41:45,391
Mr. Lowrey told me you got a baby
factory going on at your house.

587
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,298
- Is that true?
- Here you go.

588
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:52,731
If that ain't enough, I'll run you in for extortion.

589
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,073
You know, I'm so stupid sometimes.

590
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,113
- Are you?
- Now that you mention it...

591
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:59,581
Mr. Lowrey did mention you coming by tonight.

592
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:01,175
What did he say? Did he say he had a key?

593
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:05,816
- Hang out. Here you go.
- Hang out?

594
00:42:05,925 --> 00:42:07,722
- Is this it?
- Yeah. You're hurting me.

595
00:42:07,827 --> 00:42:09,954
- Thank you.
- Good to see you.

596
00:42:10,064 --> 00:42:12,658
- Good to see you.
- Have fun.

597
00:42:13,734 --> 00:42:15,497
- It's not like that.
- Sure.

598
00:42:15,573 --> 00:42:17,393
It's not like that.

599
00:42:22,513 --> 00:42:26,279
Yeah, come on. Watch your step walking through.

600
00:42:26,383 --> 00:42:28,943
Damn, I must have left some incense burning.

601
00:42:29,054 --> 00:42:31,887
Welcome to Casa de Lowrey.

602
00:42:33,225 --> 00:42:35,785
This is kind of...

603
00:42:35,896 --> 00:42:38,126
I'm always moving my switches.

604
00:42:38,231 --> 00:42:40,495
I'm always decorating, so sometimes
I just don't know where shit is.

605
00:42:41,401 --> 00:42:44,269
Damn! Shit!

606
00:42:46,008 --> 00:42:48,067
Why am I tripping on shit I know is there?

607
00:42:50,647 --> 00:42:52,046
You found a light switch.

608
00:42:52,149 --> 00:42:54,948
I should have known it was there
since I decorated the place.

609
00:42:55,052 --> 00:42:56,849
Yeah.

610
00:42:56,955 --> 00:42:58,650
Hi, Mike. This is Yvette.

611
00:42:58,754 --> 00:43:01,814
Ignore this. It's one of my freaks, Yvette.

612
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:04,156
She's always calling. Got to have it.

613
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,355
Don't call no more now, freak.

614
00:43:07,466 --> 00:43:12,335
- All this on a cop's salary?
- I feel like having you right now...

615
00:43:12,438 --> 00:43:13,837
It's honest money.

616
00:43:13,941 --> 00:43:16,239
I'm a second generation rich kid.

617
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,709
So if you're not in it for the paycheck...

618
00:43:18,813 --> 00:43:21,146
are you some kind of action junkie?

619
00:43:21,249 --> 00:43:23,581
Yeah. If that's what you want to call it.

620
00:43:23,686 --> 00:43:27,884
I don't mind bats swung at my head,
bullets damn near grazing my ass.

621
00:43:27,989 --> 00:43:30,856
Gives me a rush. Look...

622
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,486
let me give you a broad stroke of the place.

623
00:43:33,598 --> 00:43:36,999
Got some T-bones in the fridge for Luke and Dukie.

624
00:43:37,101 --> 00:43:39,365
Sorry. Your fridge is this way.

625
00:43:39,471 --> 00:43:43,430
- I confuse my own shit.
- Wait a minute.

626
00:43:43,543 --> 00:43:48,106
- You're leaving me here alone?
- Yeah, I gotta get back to the PD.

627
00:43:48,214 --> 00:43:52,913
- These are Miami's peak crime hours.
- Apparently.

628
00:43:54,588 --> 00:43:57,752
They said that this deal was going down in four days.

629
00:43:57,861 --> 00:44:02,525
I obviously seem to be kind of a major glitch...

630
00:44:02,633 --> 00:44:06,160
You ain't with the bad guys now.

631
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:07,737
You're with the cops...

632
00:44:07,873 --> 00:44:10,707
with Mike Lowrey.

633
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:13,607
Everything will be all right. Trust me.

634
00:44:13,712 --> 00:44:15,577
I'll be back.

635
00:44:15,681 --> 00:44:19,139
I know there's no time to joke, but remember in the movie...

636
00:44:20,254 --> 00:44:21,915
All right.

637
00:44:22,989 --> 00:44:25,321
Thanks for everything, Mike.

638
00:44:26,761 --> 00:44:28,194
I'm going.

639
00:44:33,034 --> 00:44:35,469
- Chet.
- That was quick. You one of those guys?

640
00:44:35,571 --> 00:44:38,165
- In and out.
- It's not like that.

641
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:41,073
The girl's a witness. I need you to keep an eye out.

642
00:44:41,176 --> 00:44:42,803
- No problem.
- Now listen to me.

643
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:45,404
- Hear me. That's right.
- Me? Ok.

644
00:44:45,515 --> 00:44:50,476
The moment Lowrey gets in, have him call me at home.

645
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:52,181
- At my home.
- Call you at home.

646
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,155
Use this phone. Do not let him go upstairs.

647
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,285
Don't let him go upstairs? But he lives here.

648
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:58,660
I don't want to argue with Mr. Lowrey. I could lose my job.

649
00:44:58,766 --> 00:45:00,928
Trust me on this, okay?

650
00:45:01,035 --> 00:45:03,697
Call you from here. Don't let him up.

651
00:45:03,806 --> 00:45:05,671
- No problem.
- Important witness.

652
00:45:05,774 --> 00:45:07,002
Thank you.

653
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:09,407
I got a better idea. I'm getting off in two hours.

654
00:45:09,511 --> 00:45:12,139
If you want, I could go upstairs and watch the door.

655
00:45:12,247 --> 00:45:14,182
Like the cops do in the movies? They sit on a stool?

656
00:45:14,285 --> 00:45:15,684
I got a magazine and everything.

657
00:45:15,787 --> 00:45:17,186
I don't let anybody in or out.

658
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,218
Seriously, all kidding aside, I want to help.

659
00:45:21,327 --> 00:45:24,023
You're helping. Can you do it from here?

660
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:27,191
- Yeah, I can do it from here.
- Fine.

661
00:45:27,302 --> 00:45:29,793
- That helps. From here, okay?
- Ok. All right.

662
00:45:29,904 --> 00:45:33,169
It's funny that you ask me, because I was going to be a cop.

663
00:45:33,274 --> 00:45:34,673
I took the test and everything.

664
00:45:34,776 --> 00:45:37,711
Just didn't work out. Politics.

665
00:45:37,814 --> 00:45:40,112
Yeah. I know.

666
00:45:40,216 --> 00:45:42,150
- You're my deputy.
- I'm your deputy.

667
00:45:42,252 --> 00:45:44,846
- Watch out for everything.
- You got it.

668
00:45:44,989 --> 00:45:46,957
Take care, Chief.

669
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:48,523
I'm a deputy.

670
00:45:48,624 --> 00:45:52,686
Don't "honey baby" me. You smell like perfume.

671
00:45:52,797 --> 00:45:54,230
It was just...

672
00:45:54,332 --> 00:45:57,358
You don't even have your wedding ring on!

673
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:01,394
Damn.

674
00:46:01,507 --> 00:46:03,408
I went undercover.

675
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:08,243
It required taking off the ring
for a second, but I got the ring.

676
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:11,079
I just put my hand in my pocket
because that's where it was...

677
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,982
and it's right back on, baby.

678
00:46:14,577 --> 00:46:15,622
Shit...

679
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:18,622
Can I get a pillow?

680
00:46:18,729 --> 00:46:22,007
If it isn't the guy who doesn't return phone calls.

681
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:25,396
You mind telling me where the
hell you been the last 12 hours?

682
00:46:25,536 --> 00:46:27,436
I've been paging you all night.

683
00:46:27,538 --> 00:46:30,269
We got a situation here you need to know about.

684
00:46:30,376 --> 00:46:33,106
Look, Marcus.
I got a dead madam...

685
00:46:33,212 --> 00:46:35,646
I got a concussion and I got a real bad headache.

686
00:46:35,749 --> 00:46:38,479
You got a headache? Let me tell you what I did last night.

687
00:46:38,585 --> 00:46:40,576
I had to sleep on my couch.

688
00:46:40,689 --> 00:46:43,123
I wake up this morning,
I got a Power Ranger stuck up my ass.

689
00:46:43,225 --> 00:46:47,059
And while we're discussing my
ass, I damn near got it blown off.

690
00:46:47,163 --> 00:46:50,098
But guess what the good news is.
 I got a witness.

691
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:53,431
- Let me tell you about this witness. She likes to...
- Marcus, Marcus, shh.....

692
00:46:53,572 --> 00:46:58,236
- You sound like a nagging wife.
- I'm nagging. I'm nagging.

693
00:46:58,343 --> 00:47:01,642
You see what happens when you go
off with out me? You get into shit.

694
00:47:01,748 --> 00:47:04,444
Please, like shit don't happen when you're there.

695
00:47:04,584 --> 00:47:06,815
That ain't the point.

696
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,320
The point is if your partner pages you...

697
00:47:09,424 --> 00:47:11,255
you might want to get back to your partner.

698
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,793
I want to meet the man who whupped your ass.

699
00:47:13,927 --> 00:47:17,260
I want to meet who whupped Shaft's ass.

700
00:47:17,363 --> 00:47:20,800
Look at me, man. Last night,
you don't know what I've been through.

701
00:47:20,903 --> 00:47:24,464
My wife kicked me out of the house,
kicked me out of happy home.

702
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:29,170
But no.... you got to go
off by yourself. "I got this, partner."

703
00:47:29,278 --> 00:47:31,304
Bullshit.

704
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:33,350
I am feeling much better, though, thank you.

705
00:47:33,451 --> 00:47:35,282
- Yeah.
- And I'll get his ass.

706
00:47:37,123 --> 00:47:39,353
Be cool. Watch yourself.

707
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:42,859
What did I say? Did you hear what I said?

708
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:45,692
I heard what I said 'cause I was
standing there when I said it.

709
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:49,929
I told you to secure a witness.

710
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:53,803
Not to shoot up a neighborhood!
Not to do another dead body!

711
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:56,505
Just get the dope back, and do it quietly.

712
00:47:56,612 --> 00:48:00,207
Look, Captain, this whole situation is getting out of control.

713
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:03,376
- You're goddamn right!
- Look, man...

714
00:48:03,521 --> 00:48:07,218
I damn near had to pass a pop
quiz before she believed I was him.

715
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:11,895
Going, going... Shit. A little off.

716
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,329
I haven't killed anybody yet today, Captain.

717
00:48:14,467 --> 00:48:17,368
Do you want me to yell at you? I can do that.

718
00:48:17,471 --> 00:48:22,535
Let me tell you something. This
witness is my only good news.

719
00:48:22,678 --> 00:48:26,136
You guys are bad news. So what does that mean?

720
00:48:26,283 --> 00:48:29,377
That means if you have to be Mike Lowrey,
Santa Claus, FD Hutton...

721
00:48:29,485 --> 00:48:31,453
that's what you're gonna be!

722
00:48:31,555 --> 00:48:34,252
Wait a minute. What the hell is going on here?

723
00:48:36,393 --> 00:48:39,191
I was getting them all in before you showed up.

724
00:48:39,296 --> 00:48:42,459
Can somebody talk to me, please?
Can I know what's going on?

725
00:48:42,565 --> 00:48:47,435
Captain, these fools could have got
a look at my license plate last night.

726
00:48:47,505 --> 00:48:49,564
Where's the girl now?

727
00:48:51,477 --> 00:48:53,445
- His place. 
- What?

728
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:57,243
You left her by herself? Our only fucking witness?

729
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:59,548
You left a strange hooker alone in my apartment?

730
00:48:59,689 --> 00:49:03,284
The girl is not a hooker, as far as I know.

731
00:49:03,392 --> 00:49:06,919
I had to stash her somewhere; her
and her dogs, Luke and Dukie.

732
00:49:07,029 --> 00:49:09,429
So you left dogs in my house?

733
00:49:09,531 --> 00:49:11,898
There's dogs and a hooker in my house?

734
00:49:12,003 --> 00:49:14,471
How about you add some chimps? We can have a carnival.

735
00:49:14,606 --> 00:49:16,267
I said she isn't a hooker.

736
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:18,366
- Can you please...
- Shut up!

737
00:49:20,346 --> 00:49:23,406
For years, Sinclair has been up my
ass, trying to pin something on me.

738
00:49:23,549 --> 00:49:26,144
I'm always taking it for you. Do it for me!

739
00:49:29,624 --> 00:49:32,422
If we get this witness to ID the shooters...

740
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,323
maybe we catch our bad guys.

741
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:39,391
But until then, you are Mike Lowrey.

742
00:49:39,537 --> 00:49:41,664
You be him. That's what you are. You're him.

743
00:49:41,805 --> 00:49:44,137
I don't want to hear it. And you...

744
00:49:44,241 --> 00:49:47,472
You're you. You be you, but not in front of her.

745
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:49,046
You're him! You're you!

746
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:58,021
Can we get a time-out, Captain?
Am I the designated homeless?

747
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:00,150
Does it look like I care?

748
00:50:00,293 --> 00:50:02,990
Whatever it takes, all right?

749
00:50:03,132 --> 00:50:06,329
What did she say to you? The shooters
are making their drop in four days?

750
00:50:06,434 --> 00:50:07,924
So we got four days.

751
00:50:08,036 --> 00:50:11,528
Captain, what kind of plan is that?

752
00:50:11,673 --> 00:50:13,766
I can't be shacked up with that woman.

753
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:17,438
I have a family to look after. My wife will kill my ass!

754
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:20,381
You don't like your job? Quit.

755
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:24,218
Damn!

756
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:29,185
Look, I'll stay at the house with Theresa and the kids.

757
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:31,194
Thank you, but no thanks.

758
00:50:31,331 --> 00:50:33,390
You wouldn't last five minutes with my family.

759
00:50:33,533 --> 00:50:37,435
Please, married life is easy. You
only got one woman to satisfy.

760
00:50:39,439 --> 00:50:42,603
Yo, man. We ain't the Cosbys.

761
00:50:42,712 --> 00:50:45,203
Let's go. I got this.

762
00:50:45,347 --> 00:50:46,712
Go.

763
00:50:49,052 --> 00:50:51,486
Everybody wants to be like Mike.

764
00:50:51,621 --> 00:50:54,716
Yeah, and you're gonna be retired like him too.

765
00:50:54,826 --> 00:50:57,056
I'd have dunked it on your ass.

766
00:50:58,163 --> 00:51:00,461
Cleveland? I have never...

767
00:51:01,867 --> 00:51:04,563
Look, woman, I done told you.

768
00:51:04,671 --> 00:51:06,162
It's a federal subpoena.

769
00:51:06,273 --> 00:51:07,672
Am I supposed to tell them no?

770
00:51:07,776 --> 00:51:10,370
I don't know what you'll tell them. Why can't he go?

771
00:51:10,478 --> 00:51:13,413
- Why can't you go?
- I wanted to...

772
00:51:13,515 --> 00:51:16,075
but Captain Howard said I'm irresponsible.

773
00:51:16,184 --> 00:51:20,053
No, he said, "A loose cannon,"
because I've been shooting in public.

774
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:25,094
- Out of now here sometimes.
- Mike, please.

775
00:51:26,799 --> 00:51:29,962
Look, baby, the neighborhood has had a lot of break-ins.

776
00:51:30,103 --> 00:51:31,968
I can handle it. I don't need Mike to handle it.

777
00:51:32,071 --> 00:51:34,938
I know you can handle it, but I'm worrying about me.

778
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,476
Mike's going to stay here with you
and the kids, take care of y'all...

779
00:51:38,576 --> 00:51:40,043
just till I come back.

780
00:51:40,179 --> 00:51:42,944
Who will pick the kids up from day care and all that?

781
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:46,486
- Mike can't do it.
- Are you listening to me? I said...

782
00:51:46,554 --> 00:51:50,718
I read a book that could probably help y'all. I saw it on...

783
00:51:50,826 --> 00:51:53,386
Mike, please, man. Can you go down
and have a Coke and a smile?

784
00:51:53,496 --> 00:51:55,965
- Please?
- All right.

785
00:51:57,167 --> 00:51:58,600
Y'all want something?

786
00:51:59,737 --> 00:52:01,500
Bring me a Coke, Mike.

787
00:52:01,606 --> 00:52:04,040
- Baby, you want a Coke?
- I'm fine, thank you.

788
00:52:04,092 --> 00:52:05,212
Mike...

789
00:52:05,743 --> 00:52:07,301
A'ight, a'ight.

790
00:52:12,452 --> 00:52:14,977
So explain it to me, Elliot.

791
00:52:15,088 --> 00:52:17,022
We've got a problem with our chemistry set?

792
00:52:17,091 --> 00:52:18,524
It's not a chemistry set.

793
00:52:18,659 --> 00:52:21,527
He knows it ain't a chemistry set, asshole.

794
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:27,836
So, what is it?

795
00:52:27,972 --> 00:52:31,965
The cutting agent is a
highly volatile substance.

796
00:52:32,075 --> 00:52:33,719
- I don't care...
- The ether...

797
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:35,783
I don't care.
I don't care!

798
00:52:36,081 --> 00:52:38,675
I'm not a fucking
chemistry teacher, Elliot.

799
00:52:39,717 --> 00:52:41,090
So what is the problem?

800
00:52:41,149 --> 00:52:43,949
The problem is that there
just too moisture down here.

801
00:52:43,789 --> 00:52:47,527
- Yeah, it's totally fucked.
- You shut up!

802
00:52:48,016 --> 00:52:49,136
Ok...

803
00:52:49,464 --> 00:52:50,863
So what else?

804
00:52:50,966 --> 00:52:53,696
It's taking longer to cook than we originally planned.

805
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:56,772
If we rush it, we'll have a lot of drugs we can't sell.

806
00:52:56,838 --> 00:53:00,036
You're fucking with my timetable here.
I gave you a deadline.

807
00:53:00,141 --> 00:53:03,133
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, I understand.

808
00:53:06,184 --> 00:53:07,304
Julie!

809
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:09,683
Yeah.

810
00:53:11,671 --> 00:53:13,071
- Oh!
- Oh, um...

811
00:53:13,361 --> 00:53:14,481
Hi.

812
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:17,094
- You dressed?
- Yeah. I am.

813
00:53:18,331 --> 00:53:21,061
Look, we have to go through some mug shots.

814
00:53:21,167 --> 00:53:23,796
I'll hook into the computer. We can do this.

815
00:53:23,904 --> 00:53:26,304
Mike, who's the guy in all the photographs?

816
00:53:28,977 --> 00:53:31,343
Sometimes I don't even look at my shelves.

817
00:53:31,446 --> 00:53:33,539
I forget all the pictures were here.

818
00:53:33,648 --> 00:53:37,676
That's my partner, Marcus Burnett.

819
00:53:37,788 --> 00:53:41,121
I've never seen anything like this before.

820
00:53:41,226 --> 00:53:44,195
I can see how it may throw you a little bit.

821
00:53:44,295 --> 00:53:45,922
It's a cop thing.

822
00:53:46,065 --> 00:53:49,263
These pictures are up here for
every time he saved my life.

823
00:53:49,368 --> 00:53:53,930
It's the same thing with him.
If you go to his place, ain't nothing but pictures of me.

824
00:53:54,041 --> 00:53:56,509
It's like a shrine. Just a reminder.

825
00:53:58,045 --> 00:54:01,379
Because when I saw it, and it was the whole wall...

826
00:54:01,484 --> 00:54:04,476
I thought maybe they were pictures of your lover.

827
00:54:04,588 --> 00:54:08,319
- Of who?
- I thought maybe you were gay.

828
00:54:09,893 --> 00:54:13,990
That I was gay? No, baby.

829
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:18,729
I didn't mean to offend you.
It's okay to be a homosexual.

830
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:22,296
You're not listening. It's not registering.

831
00:54:22,406 --> 00:54:24,636
Believe me. Did you sleep in the bed?

832
00:54:24,742 --> 00:54:28,577
Didn't you feel the dents?
The dents come from all that.

833
00:54:28,681 --> 00:54:30,239
That's how I get down.

834
00:54:30,349 --> 00:54:32,977
That's sweet.

835
00:54:33,086 --> 00:54:34,986
Gay.

836
00:54:35,089 --> 00:54:37,387
If I was, I'd change the drapes in this motherfucker.

837
00:54:39,232 --> 00:54:40,352
No.

838
00:54:45,267 --> 00:54:49,328
- Want some?
- No, thanks. I don't eat flesh.

839
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,102
What?

840
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:56,009
That's flesh that you're shoveling into your mouth.

841
00:54:56,115 --> 00:54:59,175
That was a living, breathing creature.

842
00:54:59,286 --> 00:55:01,516
It probably had a name.

843
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:04,658
It's just baloney.

844
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,989
My baloney has a first name.

845
00:55:07,094 --> 00:55:10,530
Actually, your baloney has about 30 names...

846
00:55:10,633 --> 00:55:14,194
because they take odd parts from all different ones...

847
00:55:14,303 --> 00:55:18,172
Like the leftovers: The hooves and stomach lining...

848
00:55:18,275 --> 00:55:19,674
ears, stuff like that.

849
00:55:19,777 --> 00:55:23,645
They put it into this machine and grind it all up.

850
00:55:23,748 --> 00:55:26,717
Then out comes this sheet.

851
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:29,915
That's what you're eating now.

852
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,524
You know what?
I don't eat baloney no more.

853
00:55:35,628 --> 00:55:38,893
How about a pickle?
Can I eat it?

854
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,731
It has a lot of salt, but it's fine. It is a vegetable.

855
00:55:41,837 --> 00:55:46,069
A lot of salt in the pickle?
Let me rinse it off.

856
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:48,302
There we go.

857
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:51,836
How's that?

858
00:55:51,947 --> 00:55:56,248
- Just keep going.
- I don't even taste the salt now.

859
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:01,352
Go back. Go back.

860
00:56:07,901 --> 00:56:09,368
That's the guy.

861
00:56:09,469 --> 00:56:11,630
He was there in the room.

862
00:56:11,738 --> 00:56:16,175
We got a tip they were running major
drugs, something like 50 keys.

863
00:56:16,277 --> 00:56:18,211
So we step to the door. Boom!

864
00:56:18,313 --> 00:56:21,147
Freeze! Miami PD!
Get down! Get down! Get down!

865
00:56:21,251 --> 00:56:26,279
Out of nowhere, this little crazy pimp named
Chino punched me in the head with some brass knuckles.

866
00:56:26,389 --> 00:56:29,051
Chino had been running whores.
Your dad will explain that to you.

867
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:33,119
Look at it. Your dogs are shitting all over my place.

868
00:56:33,231 --> 00:56:34,789
Liquid shit.

869
00:56:34,901 --> 00:56:39,133
It doesn't help when you shellacking
it in with furniture polish.

870
00:56:39,238 --> 00:56:41,263
There's a piece right there. Please, get that.

871
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:43,809
- Fine.
- It looks like a chip of shit.

872
00:56:45,676 --> 00:56:48,611
Francine, can I please have the
 parole jacket on Noah Trafficante?

873
00:56:48,916 --> 00:56:50,781
- Thank you.
- You know what?

874
00:56:51,187 --> 00:56:53,121
I'm getting tired of this witness.

875
00:56:53,222 --> 00:56:56,123
I want to get back to my life the way it was.

876
00:56:56,225 --> 00:56:59,718
I'm tired. I got married so I could stop lying.

877
00:56:59,831 --> 00:57:01,731
I cannot believe you're complaining.

878
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:05,769
You got it easy compared to me,
living in that zoo you call home.

879
00:57:05,871 --> 00:57:08,271
- Why you have to call my place a zoo?
- Now you want to fight me.

880
00:57:08,374 --> 00:57:10,172
- I'm tired of you talking that stuff, man.
- You want to fight me.

881
00:57:10,277 --> 00:57:13,337
- Don't call my place a zoo.
- Listen... Francine, please...

882
00:57:16,114 --> 00:57:20,608
- Yo, that's my silk shirt, man!
- Yeah, it is kind of nice.

883
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:24,713
Since I'm gonna be like Mike, I
might as well dress like Mike.

884
00:57:24,826 --> 00:57:29,598
I wanna be, I wanna be
like Mike... Pow!

885
00:57:29,965 --> 00:57:33,025
You're sick. Something is wrong with you.

886
00:57:33,135 --> 00:57:35,036
You have a problem, and you should have yourself checked.

887
00:57:35,138 --> 00:57:36,799
Yeah. Probably.

888
00:57:38,643 --> 00:57:41,840
- Here's the file. He works at Club Hell.
- Thank you.

889
00:57:41,947 --> 00:57:43,881
Take care of this, please.

890
00:57:43,982 --> 00:57:46,974
- I've got to call the wife.
- Whose wife?

891
00:57:47,086 --> 00:57:49,487
Can you please do some work?

892
00:57:49,589 --> 00:57:52,080
One time today, just do something.

893
00:57:52,192 --> 00:57:55,389
- Do something that helps this case. 
- Boy...

894
00:57:55,496 --> 00:57:57,555
You look real handsome today, Marcus.

895
00:57:57,665 --> 00:57:59,895
See, it's not that kind of day.

896
00:58:00,003 --> 00:58:02,233
Leave me the fuck alone.

897
00:58:02,338 --> 00:58:04,067
Seriously. All right?

898
00:58:04,174 --> 00:58:08,110
- What's up? PMS?
- Damn the jokes.

899
00:58:08,212 --> 00:58:10,544
Ring it. I ain't in the mood.

900
00:58:10,648 --> 00:58:12,742
Yeah, that's cool. Hold on.

901
00:58:12,851 --> 00:58:14,910
All right. Write it down.

902
00:58:15,021 --> 00:58:16,420
Go ahead.

903
00:58:19,058 --> 00:58:21,049
All right.

904
00:58:21,161 --> 00:58:25,258
- How are things going with the kids?
- They're fine. You okay?

905
00:58:25,367 --> 00:58:29,360
- How's potty training going?
- Slowly, but surely...

906
00:58:29,471 --> 00:58:32,099
- You are so silly.
- Are you going to be late tonight?

907
00:58:32,209 --> 00:58:35,269
It will be 10:30, 11:00 before I get in.

908
00:58:35,377 --> 00:58:39,212
- Later.
- Don't wait up. I'll be all right.

909
00:58:43,053 --> 00:58:47,114
Why don't you rent a movie?
Something we can kick back to.

910
00:58:49,393 --> 00:58:52,454
- What you wearing?
- Man, give me the phone!

911
00:58:52,564 --> 00:58:55,124
- Baby!
- She hung up a long time ago.

912
00:58:55,235 --> 00:58:57,135
I was playing.

913
00:58:58,339 --> 00:59:00,852
- Hello?
- I was playing.

914
00:59:00,841 --> 00:59:03,970
Hey, man, don't play like that.

915
00:59:04,078 --> 00:59:05,807
That's my family. Don't break up a happy home.

916
00:59:05,914 --> 00:59:07,541
Stop wearing my clothes then.

917
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:14,820
Everybody's about the motherfucking
jokes today, ain't they? Hello?

918
00:59:14,924 --> 00:59:17,291
I cannot believe this.

919
00:59:17,395 --> 00:59:20,922
Come on, Fracine. This Eddie Dominguez
file cannot be that hard to get into.

920
00:59:21,032 --> 00:59:23,330
I've tried three times. I just can't get in.

921
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:25,369
Besides, this is illegal.

922
00:59:25,471 --> 00:59:27,496
Yeah, that never stopped you before.

923
00:59:28,776 --> 00:59:30,437
Just let me know if you get anything.

924
00:59:30,543 --> 00:59:33,842
Anything for you, but I can't get in. I tried.

925
00:59:46,865 --> 00:59:48,526
- What's up, Chet?
- Hey, Mr. Lowrey.

926
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:51,159
- Chet.
- Hey, Mr. Lowrey.

927
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,824
Ok. The Lowrey Brothers.

928
00:59:56,109 --> 00:59:59,704
Let's just get down to Club Hell and pick up Noah.

929
00:59:59,813 --> 01:00:02,714
Julie, it's me.

930
01:00:02,816 --> 01:00:05,786
You're supposed to be getting us
into this Eddie Dominguez file.

931
01:00:05,885 --> 01:00:08,376
It's gonna be a day or two before I can get Fletch out.

932
01:00:08,489 --> 01:00:11,981
- We don't have a day or two.
- I'm not the computer whiz.

933
01:00:12,092 --> 01:00:13,992
It's gonna take a while before we can hack the computer.

934
01:00:14,096 --> 01:00:17,588
- You're not taking care of shit.
- Mike, I was thinking about something...

935
01:00:18,768 --> 01:00:20,395
Hi.

936
01:00:20,502 --> 01:00:23,562
- You must be Marcus.
- I'm Marcus.

937
01:00:23,672 --> 01:00:26,197
- That's right.
- Right.

938
01:00:26,342 --> 01:00:28,173
I'm Julie.

939
01:00:28,278 --> 01:00:30,838
Julie. All right. It's nice to meet you.

940
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:36,013
You too. I recognize you from every one of the photographs.

941
01:00:36,122 --> 01:00:38,852
Yeah. He's my man, so we...

942
01:00:41,362 --> 01:00:43,695
All those on the wall.

943
01:00:43,798 --> 01:00:46,232
- Yeah.
- You must be very good.

944
01:00:46,335 --> 01:00:48,303
I'm sorry?

945
01:00:48,404 --> 01:00:51,931
As a partner. Your job, what you do.

946
01:00:52,042 --> 01:00:55,637
What time are we doing this thing tonight?

947
01:00:55,779 --> 01:00:57,975
- Excuse me?
- Mike said we were going to a club.

948
01:01:00,384 --> 01:01:03,945
Yeah. "We" as in me and my partner.

949
01:01:04,056 --> 01:01:07,287
You wanted home protective custody. You're at my house.

950
01:01:07,392 --> 01:01:09,054
That's just great.

951
01:01:09,163 --> 01:01:11,723
So I'll just stay here again...

952
01:01:11,832 --> 01:01:14,096
with Chet the mini-moron doorman to protect me?

953
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,895
Chet is very good.

954
01:01:16,003 --> 01:01:19,495
I'm sorry. That looks like a stain on your rug.

955
01:01:19,607 --> 01:01:21,940
- Damn.
- That was my baby, Luke.

956
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:25,173
He gets kind of nervous in new surroundings.

957
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:27,408
- He just shits, huh?
- Yeah.

958
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:31,478
It's like marking his territory. It's sort of a male thing.

959
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:34,580
I offered to pay Mike for the
cleaning, and he wouldn't hear of it.

960
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,251
- I'm getting rid of it.
- Yeah, you don't need that.

961
01:01:37,362 --> 01:01:40,525
I'm throwing that out anyway.
I just want a new look.

962
01:01:40,632 --> 01:01:43,533
Mike is a special guy.
Boy, Mike is special.

963
01:01:43,636 --> 01:01:46,036
I call him "Special Mike."

964
01:01:46,138 --> 01:01:49,336
It's funny how you can just laugh at that.

965
01:01:49,443 --> 01:01:51,775
That's why I love him. Now, me?

966
01:01:51,879 --> 01:01:54,905
Oooh... I'd be pissed.

967
01:01:56,450 --> 01:02:00,854
- Look at this cute dog on the couch.
- That's Luke.

968
01:02:00,958 --> 01:02:05,361
- Look how he crawls on the leather.
- You want to meet Duke? He's in bed.

969
01:02:05,462 --> 01:02:08,488
He's been feeling upset and having diarrhea...

970
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:10,294
and throwing up all morning.

971
01:02:10,401 --> 01:02:11,869
Oh, baby.

972
01:02:12,003 --> 01:02:15,234
Let's go see if little Duke is gonna be okay, shall we?

973
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:23,447
Me and you. Me and you.

974
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:25,459
Oh, Mike...

975
01:02:27,156 --> 01:02:29,716
- Lady, who are you?
- Who the hell are you?

976
01:02:29,825 --> 01:02:32,555
- You have to get out.
- Get your hands off me!

977
01:02:32,661 --> 01:02:34,891
- Lady, don't push me!
- Hey, I'm Yvette.

978
01:02:34,998 --> 01:02:38,230
- You're not the Yvette I know.
- Get your hands off me! What are you doing?

979
01:02:38,336 --> 01:02:40,236
Get out of here, all right?

980
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:45,276
Now if you don't stop stalking me, I'll
arrest your ass, you old psycho!

981
01:02:45,378 --> 01:02:49,406
- You asshole!
- Woman's into some weird shit.

982
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:52,178
- What is going on out here?
- Excuse me.

983
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:54,253
That was crazy Yvette...

984
01:02:54,356 --> 01:02:56,256
stalking me.

985
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,784
Yvette? I forgot she was coming.
You threw her out?

986
01:03:06,268 --> 01:03:08,532
Yvette is a masseuse.

987
01:03:11,874 --> 01:03:14,503
She massages shit.

988
01:03:14,646 --> 01:03:17,080
- She told me.
- Listen...

989
01:03:17,181 --> 01:03:19,911
are there any other totally hysterical...

990
01:03:20,052 --> 01:03:23,920
half-naked women popping by
tonight that I should know about?

991
01:03:24,023 --> 01:03:27,152
- She was naked?
- Titties were out a little bit.

992
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:28,625
You threw Yvette out naked?

993
01:03:31,399 --> 01:03:35,130
You're something... My wife would
hate... She hates womanizers.

994
01:03:37,269 --> 01:03:38,634
Can't believe you...

995
01:03:37,873 --> 01:03:41,105
- There's something wrong with you.
- There is?

996
01:03:41,211 --> 01:03:43,645
You don't respect other people's
shit. I've told you that for years.

997
01:03:43,781 --> 01:03:47,012
Ever since we started, you always have your trash all over.

998
01:03:47,118 --> 01:03:48,881
Enough! Please!

999
01:03:48,986 --> 01:03:51,454
Me and my partner...

1000
01:03:51,556 --> 01:03:55,152
are going to Club Hell to bust this fool Noah.

1001
01:03:55,261 --> 01:03:57,092
Does anybody have a problem with that?

1002
01:03:57,197 --> 01:03:58,824
Fine.

1003
01:04:00,467 --> 01:04:02,264
Don't blow the case.

1004
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:15,675
Frank, here's the deal: You stay put.
Anybody tells you to move, don't.

1005
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:19,813
Tell them you're making a delivery
for Mr. Fouchet. You got it?

1006
01:04:19,959 --> 01:04:23,486
Jeez. It's ether! It will explode!

1007
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:25,584
You dope!

1008
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:28,665
Don't even breathe, you knucklehead!

1009
01:04:41,317 --> 01:04:42,437
Noah...

1010
01:04:43,485 --> 01:04:45,282
I remember you.

1011
01:05:03,443 --> 01:05:08,746
Check it. We got two days left.
Let's try to do this right.

1012
01:05:08,848 --> 01:05:11,544
No gunshots, no dead bodies.

1013
01:05:11,685 --> 01:05:13,619
I'm not trying to lose my job on this one.

1014
01:05:13,721 --> 01:05:17,213
If I recall correctly, the last couple
dead bad guys belonged to you.

1015
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:19,759
And next time you have to kill them...

1016
01:05:19,861 --> 01:05:22,160
do it after you get the information we need.

1017
01:05:22,299 --> 01:05:23,960
That's just a suggestion.

1018
01:05:24,069 --> 01:05:27,061
Please. You ain't even trying to compare body counts.

1019
01:05:27,206 --> 01:05:30,937
One... Should I keep going? Damn, I'm out.

1020
01:05:33,145 --> 01:05:35,705
This guy Noah's parole jacket
says he works in there.

1021
01:05:35,816 --> 01:05:38,944
We're standing out front arguing
like a couple of school girls.

1022
01:05:39,086 --> 01:05:41,213
Why don't we put an end
to all this bickering?

1023
01:05:41,355 --> 01:05:44,916
- All right.
- Cause you're getting on my goddamn nerves.

1024
01:06:09,454 --> 01:06:14,392
- Look at you. Can you stay focused?
- What are you talking about? I'm focused!

1025
01:06:14,494 --> 01:06:17,486
Yeah, focused on all this scattered ass here.

1026
01:06:17,631 --> 01:06:20,031
Let's do what we came to do and get out of here.

1027
01:06:20,134 --> 01:06:22,796
- Simple.
- Fine. Let's split up, check around.

1028
01:06:22,905 --> 01:06:25,238
- Meet me at the bar in ten minutes.
- Fine!

1029
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:26,392
Fine!

1030
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:34,939
Holy shit. What the hell is he doing? Man!

1031
01:06:35,085 --> 01:06:37,452
That's the cop! There he is! See him?

1032
01:06:37,555 --> 01:06:39,853
- That's him!
- Yeah, I'm going!

1033
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:50,404
What's up?

1034
01:06:52,374 --> 01:06:55,673
Budweiser. Feel like I had a million of them.

1035
01:07:07,325 --> 01:07:09,418
What's up, motherfucker?

1036
01:07:24,043 --> 01:07:25,943
Tell me where to throw this jack-off!

1037
01:08:01,289 --> 01:08:02,813
Fuck!

1038
01:08:12,369 --> 01:08:16,431
Next time learn how to work the
safety with your punk ass!

1039
01:08:16,575 --> 01:08:17,974
I'll be back.

1040
01:08:26,305 --> 01:08:31,471
- Who done tore off and whupped your ass now?
- This really ain't the fucking time.

1041
01:08:31,693 --> 01:08:34,321
They know. Let's get Noah and get out of here.

1042
01:08:50,113 --> 01:08:52,673
The chick!

1043
01:08:52,783 --> 01:08:55,150
The girl! The bitch
from the rooftop!

1044
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:20,599
Julie!

1045
01:09:37,671 --> 01:09:40,105
- Let's go!
- That was the guy who shot Max!

1046
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:49,236
The truck! Let's take the truck!

1047
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,384
Right there!

1048
01:09:51,489 --> 01:09:55,152
Move! We're really in a hurry.

1049
01:09:57,295 --> 01:10:00,230
- Let's go!
- You're cops! Why are we running away?

1050
01:10:00,332 --> 01:10:03,324
- He's in there!
- Here! Go!

1051
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,272
This is good. Noah's chasing us!

1052
01:10:16,383 --> 01:10:18,951
What was that?

1053
01:10:19,207 --> 01:10:20,535
What the-?!
What was that?!

1054
01:10:20,655 --> 01:10:22,920
That was... I don't know.

1055
01:10:23,259 --> 01:10:27,286
But I had a perfectly good shot at him if your
friend Action Jackson over here...

1056
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:29,503
No! No! No!

1057
01:10:29,699 --> 01:10:31,724
This is official police business!

1058
01:10:31,835 --> 01:10:33,427
You had no business in there!

1059
01:10:33,570 --> 01:10:36,267
And can you please drive this thing?

1060
01:10:36,376 --> 01:10:38,742
Don't bring it here, all right?

1061
01:10:38,845 --> 01:10:41,177
You picked this slow-ass ice cream truck!

1062
01:10:42,982 --> 01:10:44,791
- What am I smelling?
- Just drive!

1063
01:10:44,936 --> 01:10:46,303
What am I smelling?!

1064
01:10:46,753 --> 01:10:50,315
Ether. Extremely flammable ether.

1065
01:10:50,424 --> 01:10:53,086
- Oh, shit.
- Goddamn.

1066
01:10:53,196 --> 01:10:56,131
You the man! You the
fucking man tonight!

1067
01:10:56,232 --> 01:10:59,360
You pick an ice cream truck that's a damn bomb!

1068
01:11:03,374 --> 01:11:05,638
Shit!

1069
01:11:05,718 --> 01:11:09,449
- This is protective custody?
- Yes!

1070
01:11:15,818 --> 01:11:17,218
Oh, shit!

1071
01:11:32,776 --> 01:11:35,074
You better do something, boy,
cause we're running out of road!

1072
01:11:35,121 --> 01:11:36,952
Who picked this dumb-ass road?

1073
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,909
All the goddamn roads in Miami,
and you're running out of it!

1074
01:11:39,983 --> 01:11:44,420
- You better come up with an idea fast!
- Why I gotta come up with all the ideas?!

1075
01:11:57,304 --> 01:11:58,393
Take this shit!

1076
01:11:58,868 --> 01:12:01,668
We're coming to a dead end!
There's no more road!

1077
01:12:10,186 --> 01:12:12,154
We're out of fucking road!

1078
01:12:15,259 --> 01:12:19,390
- Motherfucker's gonna blow!
- Get the fuck out!

1079
01:12:33,797 --> 01:12:34,917
Well...

1080
01:12:35,597 --> 01:12:37,895
Should I add this to your body count?

1081
01:12:40,524 --> 01:12:43,585
There goes our only lead to the dope.

1082
01:12:43,695 --> 01:12:46,755
Ain't this a bitch?

1083
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:48,869
"The dope"?

1084
01:12:50,036 --> 01:12:52,004
What are you talking about?

1085
01:12:52,104 --> 01:12:54,596
How about "there goes our only lead to Max's killer"?

1086
01:12:54,706 --> 01:12:55,777
He's still out there.

1087
01:12:57,876 --> 01:12:59,434
Oh, but that's not really important.

1088
01:12:59,544 --> 01:13:02,328
- It's not like it's your job to protect people. Holy shit.
- See what I'm saying?

1089
01:13:02,415 --> 01:13:04,474
- She's crazy.
- <i>I'm </i>crazy?

1090
01:13:08,824 --> 01:13:10,621
- You're gone!
- I'm out of here!

1091
01:13:10,725 --> 01:13:12,625
- What is wrong with you? Stop!
- She done fucking zoomed!

1092
01:13:12,728 --> 01:13:16,391
- This is the witness!
- That's it. You deal with her.

1093
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:18,020
-Julie. Listen.
- No way.

1094
01:13:18,234 --> 01:13:20,601
- Bullshit!
- Yes, you're right.

1095
01:13:20,704 --> 01:13:24,299
This started because of missing
drugs, but let me tell you something.

1096
01:13:24,408 --> 01:13:28,674
- There is absolutely nothing more important to Mike...
- Can't explain it...!

1097
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:31,408
than doing this guy that killed Max.

1098
01:13:32,518 --> 01:13:36,511
I know he has a hard time
expressing his real feelings.

1099
01:13:38,926 --> 01:13:41,827
Come on. It will be all right, okay?

1100
01:13:41,929 --> 01:13:43,830
We need you.

1101
01:13:43,933 --> 01:13:46,094
Part of the team.

1102
01:13:46,202 --> 01:13:49,035
I thought he was supposed to be the smooth one.

1103
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:54,837
- This has not been a good day.
- Damn right. This is bullshit.

1104
01:13:54,944 --> 01:13:57,175
We got two days to find these fools...

1105
01:13:57,283 --> 01:14:00,684
and we got no leads because you
cooked Noah's ass on the freeway.

1106
01:14:04,625 --> 01:14:07,025
- Shampoo?
- Hello.

1107
01:14:08,128 --> 01:14:10,359
- There.
- Well, let's just do that.

1108
01:14:11,634 --> 01:14:13,567
- What's up?
- Hey.

1109
01:14:17,807 --> 01:14:21,038
Julie, it don't take that long to get shampoo.

1110
01:14:21,142 --> 01:14:23,202
- Please, let's go.
- Look at this.

1111
01:14:23,312 --> 01:14:25,143
Animal tested. Animal tested.

1112
01:14:25,247 --> 01:14:28,045
Do you know how many chemicals are in this stuff?

1113
01:14:28,151 --> 01:14:31,120
I don't care if you go bald.
Just get it and let's go.

1114
01:14:31,108 --> 01:14:32,228
Jo Jo.

1115
01:14:32,323 --> 01:14:34,815
He is a chemist.

1116
01:14:34,927 --> 01:14:36,827
That's entirely too much heroin and too much ether...

1117
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:38,488
for just nobody to know nothing.

1118
01:14:38,598 --> 01:14:40,395
What is he talking about?

1119
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:43,663
You know the barrels of ether that
blew up on the ice cream truck?

1120
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:45,863
They were going to use that to process the heroin.

1121
01:14:45,972 --> 01:14:48,737
Yeah, they do that to cut it. It quadruples the value.

1122
01:14:48,844 --> 01:14:51,404
Yeah, you can't just stick it in the microwave.

1123
01:14:51,513 --> 01:14:53,777
Maybe you're onto something.
Let's just pay for this, all right?

1124
01:14:57,854 --> 01:15:00,346
- How much is that?
- Fourteen twenty-five.

1125
01:15:00,458 --> 01:15:02,756
Damn. I must have left my wallet somewhere.

1126
01:15:02,861 --> 01:15:08,060
Freeze, mother bitches!
Don't you move!

1127
01:15:08,166 --> 01:15:10,726
- I'm not understanding. I really don't.
- Shut up!

1128
01:15:10,836 --> 01:15:14,074
- Do you just attract violent people?
- Shut the fuck up!

1129
01:15:14,211 --> 01:15:16,031
Take it easy, alright?

1130
01:15:16,043 --> 01:15:19,274
- We are police officers.
- You're not police officers.

1131
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:22,781
- I'm not stupid. I know. I've seen police.
- What are you?

1132
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:25,177
- I'm going to reach for my badge.
- Badges?

1133
01:15:25,172 --> 01:15:27,334
You want badges, mother bitch?!

1134
01:15:27,527 --> 01:15:29,188
I give you badges! Here!

1135
01:15:29,527 --> 01:15:32,087
Ninety-nine cents each! I sell you some!

1136
01:15:32,196 --> 01:15:35,097
You got eight badges! I told
you this cop thing don't work.

1137
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:38,226
I blow you! Then I blow you!

1138
01:15:38,337 --> 01:15:41,059
Blow me? What the fuck? No.
Hump me. That's all right.

1139
01:15:41,059 --> 01:15:44,460
I'm from the Middle East! I kill before. I kill again!

1140
01:15:44,876 --> 01:15:48,243
- Fuck me, please! Hold on!
- No, you hold on!

1141
01:15:48,346 --> 01:15:50,338
Do you see the fucking emotion
 I'm going through now?

1142
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:52,350
That means this shit is serious.

1143
01:15:52,453 --> 01:15:56,082
Me and this motherfucker's not vibing
right now. That's what that means.

1144
01:15:56,191 --> 01:15:59,251
- You got something on your chest?
- That's what I'm saying!

1145
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:02,171
- Hello? The guy has got a cannon.
- What do you want?

1146
01:16:02,171 --> 01:16:03,254
- Do you want some?!
- I want some!

1147
01:16:03,254 --> 01:16:04,809
You want some bad enough,
then you come get some!

1148
01:16:04,809 --> 01:16:06,800
- I'm gone.
- Hey, freeze, bitch!

1149
01:16:07,237 --> 01:16:12,368
- <i>You</i> freeze, bitch!
- Oh, shit. I'm fucked.

1150
01:16:12,476 --> 01:16:15,503
Now back up, put the gun down...

1151
01:16:15,614 --> 01:16:18,811
and give me a pack of Tropical Fruit Bubblicious.

1152
01:16:18,918 --> 01:16:21,011
And some Skittles.

1153
01:16:25,125 --> 01:16:27,993
Hell of a night. I'm going to bed.

1154
01:16:28,095 --> 01:16:32,555
So make your self at home. It's your bed.

1155
01:16:33,735 --> 01:16:36,602
I'll sit down for a minute...

1156
01:16:36,706 --> 01:16:39,368
'cause I'm guarding shit, you know.

1157
01:16:39,475 --> 01:16:42,036
I'm watching out for the bad boys.

1158
01:16:42,147 --> 01:16:45,514
I can see things, you know...

1159
01:16:45,618 --> 01:16:47,381
real well from my "peripheals."

1160
01:16:47,486 --> 01:16:49,386
You know, for such a stud, Mike Lowrey...

1161
01:16:49,488 --> 01:16:54,722
you sure seem a little rigid about having a girl in your bed.

1162
01:16:54,828 --> 01:16:57,388
Who? Me? Mike Lowrey?

1163
01:16:57,498 --> 01:17:01,229
I'm not rigid. I'm comfortable.

1164
01:17:01,336 --> 01:17:03,395
This is my bed.

1165
01:17:03,505 --> 01:17:06,304
- Why would I be uncomfortable?
- I don't know.

1166
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:11,939
I think it's more than just wired.
Maybe it was all the guns and stuff.

1167
01:17:12,081 --> 01:17:16,575
I've never really shot a gun
before, and that's... All that steel.

1168
01:17:16,686 --> 01:17:21,090
I'm feeling... Don't you feel a little funny?

1169
01:17:22,661 --> 01:17:26,256
- I'm not a comedian, but...
- I don't mean that kind of funny.

1170
01:17:26,365 --> 01:17:29,459
I mean like funny.

1171
01:17:36,879 --> 01:17:39,871
Now, you don't want that.

1172
01:17:41,549 --> 01:17:43,211
'Cause when I come...

1173
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:45,108
I come with the thunder.

1174
01:17:45,591 --> 01:17:49,618
Mike, you sound like you're
saving yourself for marriage.

1175
01:17:53,065 --> 01:17:56,297
That ain't me. That's Marcus.

1176
01:17:56,401 --> 01:17:58,733
You know what I'm saying? He's the married one.

1177
01:17:59,072 --> 01:18:01,131
I got some other... Oh, no.

1178
01:18:02,075 --> 01:18:04,349
- I've seen it now. Turn the page.
- No.

1179
01:18:04,425 --> 01:18:06,378
Turn the page, girl.
I done already seen it.

1180
01:18:09,085 --> 01:18:11,485
Don't laugh.

1181
01:18:11,587 --> 01:18:13,577
I cannot believe he wore his Afro that big.

1182
01:18:13,577 --> 01:18:16,546
- I forgot all about that.
- I think he looked cute like that.

1183
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:19,517
What's Marcus's wife like?

1184
01:18:23,936 --> 01:18:25,403
She's like a wife.

1185
01:18:25,536 --> 01:18:30,599
I mean, she must be pretty
amazing to keep a guy like Marcus.

1186
01:18:34,616 --> 01:18:38,211
- Keep a guy like what?
- Like watching him tonight...

1187
01:18:38,318 --> 01:18:41,651
He's very sort of take-charge.

1188
01:18:41,754 --> 01:18:45,281
The way he was throwing guys this way and that.

1189
01:18:45,394 --> 01:18:47,692
There's something about him.
I don't know what it is.

1190
01:18:47,796 --> 01:18:50,196
He's so smooth, you know?

1191
01:18:50,299 --> 01:18:54,030
Boy, I bet his wife's...

1192
01:18:54,136 --> 01:18:57,731
enjoying the smoothness right this minute.

1193
01:18:59,810 --> 01:19:03,576
- He's got a quality women respond to.
- Sure.

1194
01:19:03,681 --> 01:19:05,205
I can't imagine the kind of woman...

1195
01:19:05,315 --> 01:19:09,843
that wouldn't find Marcus attractive.

1196
01:19:09,989 --> 01:19:13,721
Probably couldn't be around him and just...

1197
01:19:13,828 --> 01:19:15,728
You know, like our situation.

1198
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:19,561
- If two people were alone...
- Not with a guy like that.

1199
01:19:19,667 --> 01:19:21,259
Excuse me.

1200
01:19:25,109 --> 01:19:28,545
What is wrong with him? This one
goes on the bulletin board at work.

1201
01:19:28,679 --> 01:19:30,874
Uh-uh. Don't do that.

1202
01:19:31,993 --> 01:19:34,826
<i>Mike, put it back in. I cannot
believe you took it out.</i>

1203
01:19:35,286 --> 01:19:38,222
Come on. Marcus will kill us if he finds out.
Give it to me.

1204
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:40,187
<i>I can't believe I let you see it.</i>

1205
01:19:40,294 --> 01:19:41,784
Motherfucker!

1206
01:19:49,038 --> 01:19:50,471
Goddamn it.

1207
01:19:50,573 --> 01:19:54,771
Got some jewelry for you . I'm sorry, but damn that.

1208
01:19:54,877 --> 01:20:00,247
I think we need to address the serious
lack of trust in this relationship.

1209
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:01,772
- Please.
- Is this even legal?

1210
01:20:01,932 --> 01:20:03,283
I don't think this is legal.

1211
01:20:03,393 --> 01:20:08,990
I won't be long.
Oh, it's legal. Out of sight.

1212
01:20:09,227 --> 01:20:12,691
Sanchez, this is Lowrey.
Yeah, your mother. Listen.

1213
01:20:12,982 --> 01:20:15,344
I think these guys are
about to make a move.

1214
01:20:15,689 --> 01:20:18,658
Blue convertible, two visible
occupants. Check it out, all right?

1215
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,018
Hey, hey, here we go.

1216
01:20:25,979 --> 01:20:27,537
- Is that our guy?
- That's him.

1217
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:31,116
- Where's the girl?
- I don't see any girl. There's no girl.

1218
01:20:37,025 --> 01:20:40,052
Fuck off, barking-ass dog. Shut up.

1219
01:20:42,867 --> 01:20:44,596
Sneak on my own motherfucking house.

1220
01:20:46,202 --> 01:20:48,966
What in the world? Very strange.

1221
01:20:49,073 --> 01:20:52,305
His ass upstairs. Supposed to be my boy.

1222
01:20:52,411 --> 01:20:54,038
You motherfucker.

1223
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:56,239
Ducking and weaving up and down.

1224
01:20:56,382 --> 01:20:59,078
Look at this shit. Is this what you want?

1225
01:20:59,219 --> 01:21:01,619
Got me climbing like a fucking chimp.

1226
01:21:01,722 --> 01:21:04,214
But I ain't going out like that.

1227
01:21:04,327 --> 01:21:07,023
It don't take anybody that long to get into bed.

1228
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:11,430
Got my babies in the house.

1229
01:21:11,535 --> 01:21:13,833
Your man can't get no quality time...

1230
01:21:13,936 --> 01:21:16,531
but, oh yeah, my partner
can get some quality time.

1231
01:21:16,641 --> 01:21:17,767
I don't play that shit.

1232
01:21:26,551 --> 01:21:29,385
- There's somebody out there.
- Quick, get the kids.

1233
01:21:31,457 --> 01:21:34,324
I knew it! I didn't have to
call the fucking psychic line!

1234
01:21:34,427 --> 01:21:35,655
Freeze!

1235
01:21:40,934 --> 01:21:43,665
- Move and you're a dead man!
- Motherfucker!

1236
01:21:43,772 --> 01:21:47,037
Gun up to his head. They're going
to shoot each other. Unbelievable.

1237
01:21:47,142 --> 01:21:50,839
- Miami Police! Freeze!
- I am the police!

1238
01:21:50,948 --> 01:21:53,075
- Marcus, what are you doing?
- You're doing Theresa!

1239
01:21:53,182 --> 01:21:55,743
- I'm not doing Theresa!
- Nobody does my baby!

1240
01:21:57,956 --> 01:22:01,119
We could sneak up and snuff them both right now.

1241
01:22:01,227 --> 01:22:02,751
Yeah, but we're supposed to get the girl.
Forget them.

1242
01:22:02,895 --> 01:22:06,160
Never fuck with a cop's family, asshole.

1243
01:22:06,299 --> 01:22:09,029
- Doesn't that piss you off?
- That pisses the fuck out of me, baby.

1244
01:22:09,135 --> 01:22:11,069
Don't get me started. Get out of the car.

1245
01:22:12,206 --> 01:22:15,471
Fuck it! Some shit is making you crazy.

1246
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:18,579
You know damn well there's nothing
going on between me and Theresa!

1247
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:25,012
Man, I've been your partner for six years...

1248
01:22:25,123 --> 01:22:27,182
and I've been your boy all my life.

1249
01:22:27,325 --> 01:22:29,088
For you to even think...

1250
01:22:29,227 --> 01:22:32,391
To let some dumb shit like
that creep up in your mind...

1251
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:34,465
This is me! What is wrong with you?

1252
01:22:35,835 --> 01:22:38,303
It was just... I don't know.

1253
01:22:38,437 --> 01:22:40,389
I just...

1254
01:22:40,389 --> 01:22:42,113
Mike? Mike?!

1255
01:22:45,447 --> 01:22:47,381
Yeah, I'm fine.

1256
01:22:47,484 --> 01:22:49,884
Get the fuck out of here.
Where's Julie?

1257
01:22:49,987 --> 01:22:52,512
She's in the car, handcuffed to the steering wheel.

1258
01:22:52,654 --> 01:22:54,679
Are you trying to blow this case?

1259
01:22:54,822 --> 01:22:56,916
My bad, man. I ain't had no quality time.

1260
01:22:57,059 --> 01:22:59,050
You know how that is.
Sometimes you do dumb shit.

1261
01:22:59,161 --> 01:23:01,391
- Let's go.
- That's all that is.

1262
01:23:03,867 --> 01:23:05,926
Yo, my bad.

1263
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:07,901
It's cool.

1264
01:23:08,006 --> 01:23:11,238
Go. All right. Yeah.

1265
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,905
These calls were made to Club Hell...

1266
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:17,449
from this precinct.

1267
01:23:17,550 --> 01:23:19,108
Explain.

1268
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:23,248
I'll ask you one more time.
Give me a goddamn name!

1269
01:23:24,163 --> 01:23:25,907
Ok! Ok.

1270
01:23:27,729 --> 01:23:30,129
- All I know is his name.
- Give me his name.

1271
01:23:30,232 --> 01:23:33,258
You're looking at a lot of time.
You know that?

1272
01:23:33,403 --> 01:23:36,737
Fouchet.
Fouchet, I think.

1273
01:23:36,808 --> 01:23:38,114
That's his whole name?
Fouchet?

1274
01:23:38,389 --> 01:23:41,773
Fouchet. I'm just an errand boy.

1275
01:23:41,914 --> 01:23:43,779
Stop it, please. You're gonna make me cry.

1276
01:23:43,916 --> 01:23:46,783
I swear, watching the house was my first gig.

1277
01:23:46,921 --> 01:23:49,890
How sweet. Does that make you union?

1278
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:53,949
You know something, if you were a real cop,
 in the field working every day...

1279
01:23:54,096 --> 01:23:56,121
you'd realize that sometimes shit happens.

1280
01:23:56,230 --> 01:24:00,065
Don't give me that crap. You're
on your way to being reassigned.

1281
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:02,638
- Shut down soon.
- Who will reassign me? You?

1282
01:24:02,741 --> 01:24:04,641
You don't have the authority to reassign me.

1283
01:24:04,743 --> 01:24:07,507
Until you do, stay the hell out of here!

1284
01:24:07,612 --> 01:24:11,070
They should just bone and get that shit over with.

1285
01:24:11,182 --> 01:24:14,050
I'm getting really tired of this.

1286
01:24:14,154 --> 01:24:16,281
You're tired?

1287
01:24:16,423 --> 01:24:20,178
These guard dogs aren't cutting
it. They're overfed. They're lazy.

1288
01:24:20,458 --> 01:24:23,825
We need video surveillance 'cause
these guard dogs are nothing...

1289
01:24:23,963 --> 01:24:27,195
Jo Jo. Don't make this hard!

1290
01:24:30,571 --> 01:24:33,233
Nice running into you, Jo Jo.

1291
01:24:33,375 --> 01:24:36,105
Always making it hard on yourself, Jo Jo.

1292
01:24:36,211 --> 01:24:39,010
"Gee, Julie, what have you been
up to the last couple days?"

1293
01:24:39,115 --> 01:24:42,551
"Oh nothing. Just hanging out,
handcuffed to steering wheels."

1294
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:45,851
We're looking for someone who
can step on a shit load of heroin.

1295
01:24:45,955 --> 01:24:48,856
Do it real fast, real well. We're
looking for a real pro, Jo Jo.

1296
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:52,020
I told you already, I'm in the rubber business now.

1297
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:54,690
Jo Jo, we're not playing, man.

1298
01:24:55,802 --> 01:24:57,895
I'm telling you, man.
I'm straight, man.

1299
01:24:58,005 --> 01:25:00,132
I'm straight like a fucking
board, like an arrow.

1300
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,037
I'm so straight right now, I'm sick.

1301
01:25:02,142 --> 01:25:05,635
It's a lot of dope. Who
could cut it real quick?

1302
01:25:05,749 --> 01:25:09,310
"Cut it"? You cut it up?

1303
01:25:09,418 --> 01:25:12,444
- I don't know nothing about it.
- So sick of this bullshit.

1304
01:25:15,158 --> 01:25:18,423
- What's up, Jo?
- You're pulling a gun on me?

1305
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:21,988
You guys are cops! I can't believe this!
I should turn you in to Hard Copy.

1306
01:25:22,135 --> 01:25:23,941
- Put your ass on the TV set!
- What are you doing?

1307
01:25:23,836 --> 01:25:28,672
I got this! Jo Jo,
I got 15 bullets in this gun.

1308
01:25:28,751 --> 01:25:30,167
- Mike
- And I swear...

1309
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:32,858
if you don't start talking to me,
I'll fill your lying-ass full of hot shit.

1310
01:25:32,949 --> 01:25:34,216
- Now, what's up?
- Mike!

1311
01:25:34,216 --> 01:25:37,016
He's a former ganja-smoking motherfucker.
He ain't worth it!

1312
01:25:37,018 --> 01:25:39,646
Do you want some? I'll bust your ass too!

1313
01:25:40,691 --> 01:25:43,626
So sad. You're on your own, Jo Jo.

1314
01:25:45,862 --> 01:25:48,353
- What's up, Jo?
- I'm telling you like this.

1315
01:25:48,464 --> 01:25:51,922
You splatter his ass, he's no good to us!

1316
01:25:52,069 --> 01:25:54,595
Fuck that. I'm not going down over this shit!

1317
01:25:54,706 --> 01:25:58,870
- I'm not going down for you killing Jo Jo the tire man!
- Ok! Ok!

1318
01:25:58,978 --> 01:26:01,105
I don't want no brain fragments on me!

1319
01:26:01,213 --> 01:26:03,545
That shit gets in your clothes, and it stinks!

1320
01:26:03,649 --> 01:26:06,642
- Fuck that!
- I'll tell you what I know.

1321
01:26:06,754 --> 01:26:09,587
I don't know everything. I know a little bit.

1322
01:26:09,690 --> 01:26:11,590
Tell him something, Jo!

1323
01:26:11,693 --> 01:26:14,321
It's three guys. They got a laboratory...

1324
01:26:14,429 --> 01:26:16,624
No, it's two guys.

1325
01:26:16,732 --> 01:26:19,896
One guy died in a plane crash last year. It was fucked up.

1326
01:26:20,004 --> 01:26:23,633
There should be more! Fuck, man!

1327
01:26:23,742 --> 01:26:25,835
It's one guy, really. It's only one guy.

1328
01:26:25,943 --> 01:26:27,808
- Don't fuck with me.
- One main guy.

1329
01:26:27,912 --> 01:26:31,314
This guy's an Einstein,
motherfucking genius college boy.

1330
01:26:31,417 --> 01:26:34,284
Egghead motherfucker. He
got four eyes and glasses.

1331
01:26:34,388 --> 01:26:36,515
He got a rich mama and daddy
who live out in Coconut Grove.

1332
01:26:36,623 --> 01:26:38,784
Where? Tell him again, Jo Jo!

1333
01:26:38,892 --> 01:26:41,690
- I don't want you to get hurt!
- I'll tell you where he's at.

1334
01:26:41,796 --> 01:26:45,824
- You would do that for us?
- Yeah, I want to help you guys.

1335
01:26:45,936 --> 01:26:47,335
You stick that gun down.

1336
01:26:47,437 --> 01:26:51,999
I got the address in the office.

1337
01:26:54,277 --> 01:26:56,303
Thanks a lot, Jo Jo.
Why don't you go grab that?

1338
01:26:56,414 --> 01:26:58,348
- Cool.
- You can go ahead.

1339
01:26:58,450 --> 01:27:00,680
- Now?
- Now is real good.

1340
01:27:00,787 --> 01:27:02,914
Yeah. This is on me too.

1341
01:27:03,022 --> 01:27:07,015
You guys pick out some whitewalls
as a little gift from me to you.

1342
01:27:09,963 --> 01:27:12,830
You made me think you would
shoot me for a minute.

1343
01:27:12,932 --> 01:27:14,331
I was.

1344
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:19,537
When is this punk-ass
chemist coming home?

1345
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:25,341
So this is a stakeout.
Not what I imagined.

1346
01:27:25,448 --> 01:27:28,212
Thought there would be more conversation.

1347
01:27:28,317 --> 01:27:33,016
Sorry it's not up to your usual high standards.

1348
01:27:33,124 --> 01:27:35,958
Is he always like this on a stakeout?

1349
01:27:36,996 --> 01:27:40,727
What is it? Too much caffeine?
Not enough sex?

1350
01:27:40,833 --> 01:27:43,996
Ooh...I can't believe
she went there on you.

1351
01:27:44,103 --> 01:27:49,406
You don't know who you talking to?
That's Mike Lowrey over there.

1352
01:27:50,512 --> 01:27:52,377
King Ding-a-ling.

1353
01:27:52,481 --> 01:27:54,915
Why don't you whip it out for her, big boy?

1354
01:27:55,017 --> 01:27:57,212
Uh-huh. Right on your forehead.

1355
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:58,481
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

1356
01:28:08,233 --> 01:28:11,169
- There he is! Let's go! Move!
- I'm on him!

1357
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:27,279
What are our chances?

1358
01:28:27,390 --> 01:28:30,450
Remember Club Hell? Worse.

1359
01:28:32,396 --> 01:28:34,296
That's it. I'm calling major backup.

1360
01:28:34,396 --> 01:28:37,127
- I want swimming ducks in here.
- Whoa.

1361
01:28:37,233 --> 01:28:40,464
Hold it. You know Sinclair has
every phone in the station tapped.

1362
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:43,664
- We have to do that in person.
- Shit.

1363
01:28:43,774 --> 01:28:45,799
By the time we deal with her bullshit...

1364
01:28:45,911 --> 01:28:49,473
every junkie in America will be high off our bust.

1365
01:28:51,617 --> 01:28:53,414
Can we help you?

1366
01:28:53,519 --> 01:28:56,488
I staked out all night in that jalopy too.

1367
01:28:56,590 --> 01:28:58,148
I think I earned a peek.

1368
01:28:58,259 --> 01:29:02,663
This is real cop stuff. This is not Charlie's Angels.

1369
01:29:02,765 --> 01:29:05,199
It can't hurt for her to take a peek.

1370
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:09,327
It can't hurt to look? If they fire
a goddamn bullet over here, it will hurt.

1371
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:20,847
We have guests. Have them followed.

1372
01:29:20,953 --> 01:29:23,444
Don't do anything. Just call me with their location.

1373
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:30,995
This high-speed chase ending on a trestle...

1374
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:33,829
near the River Drive and 34th Street intersection...

1375
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:37,666
was captured two nights ago by our 6 Action News team.

1376
01:29:37,773 --> 01:29:39,241
 <i>Mom!</i>

1377
01:29:39,344 --> 01:29:41,835
Both police officers involved in the incident were uninjured.

1378
01:29:41,946 --> 01:29:44,380
I thought you said Daddy was in Cleveland.

1379
01:29:44,481 --> 01:29:46,415
He can't be in Cleveland.

1380
01:29:46,518 --> 01:29:49,078
The officers didn't like the presence of our camera.

1381
01:29:49,188 --> 01:29:51,418
No, baby.
Your daddy just <i>wishes </i>he was in Cleveland.

1382
01:29:51,524 --> 01:29:55,484
I'm telling you.
This Fouchet is a slick one.

1383
01:29:56,831 --> 01:29:59,766
FBI, DEA... They got nothing on him.

1384
01:29:59,865 --> 01:30:02,231
But he has to deal with us today.

1385
01:30:13,282 --> 01:30:15,250
What's that?

1386
01:30:15,351 --> 01:30:19,220
That's the last time they handcuff me. That's what that is.

1387
01:30:19,323 --> 01:30:20,915
Good boy.

1388
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:24,787
Excuse me, ma'am.

1389
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:26,989
All visitors must be announced!

1390
01:30:27,098 --> 01:30:30,933
Pisses me off. Lady!

1391
01:30:32,039 --> 01:30:34,098
I guess when you guys get back...

1392
01:30:34,208 --> 01:30:35,937
this will all be over, right?

1393
01:30:36,044 --> 01:30:38,945
You got that right. Don't worry, though.

1394
01:30:39,047 --> 01:30:41,982
You'll be set free, cut loose.

1395
01:30:42,085 --> 01:30:44,918
You'll be back to your old life.

1396
01:30:45,021 --> 01:30:47,990
Oops. No more handcuffs.

1397
01:30:52,563 --> 01:30:54,463
- Get up out of here.
- That should be Chet...

1398
01:30:54,565 --> 01:30:55,965
with my veggie burger.

1399
01:30:56,067 --> 01:30:58,194
- Move your ass!
- You got it.

1400
01:31:01,508 --> 01:31:03,601
Hi. Can I help you?

1401
01:31:03,711 --> 01:31:06,009
Yes, I'm here to kill my husband, Marcus Burnett.

1402
01:31:06,113 --> 01:31:09,811
And that would be the tall one or the short one?

1403
01:31:09,919 --> 01:31:13,753
- The short one.
- Thought so.

1404
01:31:13,855 --> 01:31:16,483
Is Chet ringing the...
Oh!

1405
01:31:16,591 --> 01:31:18,252
Baby...

1406
01:31:20,128 --> 01:31:21,528
Theresa...

1407
01:31:23,268 --> 01:31:27,068
- Let me get your husband. - Marcus, get over here.

1408
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:33,436
I'm a... I know what it looks like. Did you get my message?

1409
01:31:36,282 --> 01:31:41,743
Can you leave me and Mrs. Burnett alone for...

1410
01:31:41,887 --> 01:31:43,354
Right.

1411
01:31:45,293 --> 01:31:47,284
Y'all met?

1412
01:31:47,395 --> 01:31:49,158
Baby...

1413
01:31:49,264 --> 01:31:51,698
I know, so let me...

1414
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:56,328
As far as I'm concerned, you can keep
the wedding ring in your pocket...

1415
01:31:56,439 --> 01:31:57,907
because you , your new little girlfriend...

1416
01:31:58,008 --> 01:31:59,703
Ooh, shit.

1417
01:31:59,811 --> 01:32:02,871
And Mike will all be very happy living here.

1418
01:32:02,981 --> 01:32:05,541
- Trust me.
- Sweetie... Honey...

1419
01:32:07,118 --> 01:32:08,517
It's not even...

1420
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:10,885
I saw it on the news.

1421
01:32:10,991 --> 01:32:14,825
- That shit be having a slant.
- It's...

1422
01:32:14,928 --> 01:32:16,896
Baby, that's not even...

1423
01:32:16,998 --> 01:32:19,228
- You're no longer welcome in my house.
- He didn't tell you ...

1424
01:32:19,334 --> 01:32:21,734
I was coming in the airport early?

1425
01:32:21,836 --> 01:32:25,034
Remember I said call her? Hold on.

1426
01:32:25,141 --> 01:32:27,268
Tell her what I told you.

1427
01:32:27,377 --> 01:32:29,971
- You were gonna bring me to your place...
- Julie. Julie!

1428
01:32:31,349 --> 01:32:34,250
All right. I ain't even gonna...

1429
01:32:34,352 --> 01:32:36,116
We're not arguing about this.

1430
01:32:36,221 --> 01:32:39,384
I'm raising my... All right, here... Baby...

1431
01:32:39,492 --> 01:32:41,119
Believe me, we wanted to tell you.

1432
01:32:41,227 --> 01:32:43,320
It really doesn't matter anymore, Marcus...

1433
01:32:43,429 --> 01:32:46,421
Mike. Kojak. Whatever your name is.

1434
01:32:46,533 --> 01:32:48,764
Aside from that fact, I'll tell you something else.

1435
01:32:48,870 --> 01:32:53,102
If his wife could find us, I'm a lot better off on my own.

1436
01:32:53,207 --> 01:32:56,540
This... I could see how it would look a trip.

1437
01:32:57,578 --> 01:33:00,639
You see me run out. I got a shirt open.

1438
01:33:00,749 --> 01:33:02,614
You see Mike half-butt-naked.

1439
01:33:02,718 --> 01:33:04,447
Then you see the white girl.

1440
01:33:04,553 --> 01:33:09,252
So the shit looks like we having one big
motherfucking orgy here, and ain't nobody humping.

1441
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:11,793
Ain't nobody doing none of that.

1442
01:33:11,928 --> 01:33:14,955
It's not what it looks like. Hear what I'm saying.

1443
01:33:15,067 --> 01:33:17,797
Baby, she's a material witness.

1444
01:33:17,903 --> 01:33:19,871
- That...
- That's real!

1445
01:33:20,006 --> 01:33:21,906
Baby, listen. That ain't...

1446
01:33:22,008 --> 01:33:24,738
It was orders, baby.

1447
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,479
Can I talk to you?

1448
01:33:27,581 --> 01:33:30,277
Can you stop so I can talk to you, please?

1449
01:33:30,385 --> 01:33:33,877
Enough with the smooth shit, Mike. It won't work anymore.

1450
01:33:43,134 --> 01:33:45,193
I don't care what you say.

1451
01:33:50,811 --> 01:33:54,713
- Duck!
- Julie, get down now!

1452
01:34:26,318 --> 01:34:29,345
- Get out, now!
- Mike, help!

1453
01:34:34,963 --> 01:34:36,658
911!

1454
01:34:39,101 --> 01:34:41,935
Yeah, 911? Chet here.

1455
01:34:42,036 --> 01:34:44,266
Go upstairs and take this. Take it!

1456
01:34:46,610 --> 01:34:49,443
Don't worry. I'll keep everybody
calm until my backup arrives.

1457
01:34:49,546 --> 01:34:51,241
I love you, Marcus.

1458
01:34:52,516 --> 01:34:54,144
Shit! I forgot to give them the address!

1459
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:30,294
Come on! Move!

1460
01:35:30,396 --> 01:35:33,230
Go! Watch it!

1461
01:35:33,335 --> 01:35:34,825
- Keep going! - Son of a bitch!

1462
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:38,328
Get her in!

1463
01:35:40,709 --> 01:35:42,199
I'll kill you if you stop running.

1464
01:35:46,181 --> 01:35:47,239
Come on!

1465
01:36:07,105 --> 01:36:08,504
Move!

1466
01:36:22,091 --> 01:36:24,321
It's okay. I'm with the police.

1467
01:36:24,462 --> 01:36:26,259
It's cool. You look great.

1468
01:36:53,462 --> 01:36:55,293
Drive!

1469
01:36:58,201 --> 01:37:00,898
- Stop shooting!
- He's still on top!

1470
01:37:03,042 --> 01:37:04,441
I'll get rid of him!

1471
01:37:08,513 --> 01:37:10,310
There he goes!

1472
01:37:30,506 --> 01:37:32,770
Don't ever say I wasn't there for you.

1473
01:37:45,824 --> 01:37:47,223
What is it with you guys?

1474
01:37:47,326 --> 01:37:49,453
How come it's always good news, bad news?

1475
01:37:49,562 --> 01:37:52,691
You know exactly where the dope
is, but you lose our only witness.

1476
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:56,166
- I just don't get it.
- Hey, Lowrey. Pick up your phone.

1477
01:37:57,553 --> 01:37:59,012
- Lowrey.
- <i>Hi, Mr. Lowrey.</i>

1478
01:37:59,341 --> 01:38:03,972
I'm keeping your sweet little friend
for four hours until I make my deal.

1479
01:38:04,115 --> 01:38:05,514
And I will make my deal.

1480
01:38:05,616 --> 01:38:08,483
I've just put a bullet in the chemist...

1481
01:38:08,586 --> 01:38:11,111
who fucked with my timetable.

1482
01:38:12,323 --> 01:38:14,791
The other one is for the girl. Okay?

1483
01:38:14,926 --> 01:38:16,553
Son of a bitch!

1484
01:38:19,699 --> 01:38:22,133
Twisted motherfucker just shot one of his employees.

1485
01:38:22,269 --> 01:38:24,794
Said if we don't back off, he'll kill Julie.

1486
01:38:24,938 --> 01:38:27,806
- Not now.
- I told you to play by the rules.

1487
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:30,504
Don't do this to me now,
I am on the verge of solving this case!

1488
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:32,547
You turned South Beach into a war zone.

1489
01:38:32,682 --> 01:38:35,879
I finally got the authority to shut you
down. As of today, you're all reassigned.

1490
01:38:38,086 --> 01:38:39,485
This is lovely.

1491
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:44,954
This guy is painting me into a corner.

1492
01:38:45,063 --> 01:38:47,258
He'll kill the girl anyway, and we're won't let her die.

1493
01:38:47,397 --> 01:38:50,764
We're not walking away from this
bust, I don't care what she says.

1494
01:38:50,902 --> 01:38:53,030
The deal goes down in four hours.

1495
01:38:53,173 --> 01:38:56,165
The means you guys got two hours to find them.

1496
01:38:57,277 --> 01:38:59,336
It's time to get lucky.

1497
01:38:59,446 --> 01:39:01,710
Go do what you gotta do.

1498
01:39:03,616 --> 01:39:08,213
Fletcher, you told us this would
move a little quicker than this.

1499
01:39:08,323 --> 01:39:12,487
It's not that easy, okay? If it was, you'd be doing it.

1500
01:39:12,628 --> 01:39:15,188
Work your magic. You say you're
a computer whiz. Come on.

1501
01:39:15,331 --> 01:39:19,200
Back up off me. I'm doing
an illegal favor for you.

1502
01:39:19,337 --> 01:39:21,737
This is what I got put in jail for.

1503
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,364
So you back up off me.

1504
01:39:23,510 --> 01:39:27,139
You don't sit your lanky ass down... bottom line...

1505
01:39:27,247 --> 01:39:29,238
I will knock you the fuck out!

1506
01:39:29,348 --> 01:39:31,544
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Can you have a seat?

1507
01:39:31,652 --> 01:39:35,019
- You said you'd get me out of jail.
- I wasn't lying.

1508
01:39:37,826 --> 01:39:39,623
Cops are so dumb. Look, it's coming up.

1509
01:39:41,864 --> 01:39:44,163
Remember, you promised to get me out.

1510
01:39:44,994 --> 01:39:47,094
Right there. Eddie Dominguez...

1511
01:39:48,373 --> 01:39:51,399
There is it. Voila.

1512
01:39:53,145 --> 01:39:55,238
"Girlfriend"?

1513
01:40:03,155 --> 01:40:06,852
It was New Year's Eve and my ex-boyfriend, Eddie...

1514
01:40:06,958 --> 01:40:08,893
and this French guy...

1515
01:40:08,997 --> 01:40:12,125
took some really horrible pictures of me.

1516
01:40:12,266 --> 01:40:16,202
They said they would put them on the bulletin board...

1517
01:40:16,305 --> 01:40:17,932
of my kid's school...

1518
01:40:18,039 --> 01:40:20,975
unless I gave them a lot of narcotics information.

1519
01:40:21,111 --> 01:40:25,275
But I never gave them you or the girl!

1520
01:40:25,382 --> 01:40:28,078
Look, they got the girl. We need to get them now.

1521
01:40:28,219 --> 01:40:30,949
Because if we don't, they'll kill her.

1522
01:40:31,055 --> 01:40:34,457
- How do you make contact?
- I have their mobile phone number.

1523
01:40:35,563 --> 01:40:36,962
God.

1524
01:40:37,064 --> 01:40:40,329
I'm sorry. Listen, Mike,
I'll make it up to you.

1525
01:40:40,433 --> 01:40:42,458
I'll do anything you want.

1526
01:40:42,604 --> 01:40:44,572
We don't have a lot of time. Let's go.

1527
01:40:48,443 --> 01:40:50,638
You have such sexy ears. You know that?

1528
01:40:50,746 --> 01:40:53,306
I want to lick them.

1529
01:40:55,351 --> 01:40:57,683
- Yeah?
- Can I speak to Romeo?

1530
01:40:57,787 --> 01:40:59,346
There ain't no Romeo here, asshole.

1531
01:40:59,458 --> 01:41:01,426
What are you laughing at?

1532
01:41:01,559 --> 01:41:04,480
This cell phone will
keep triangulating him...

1533
01:41:04,695 --> 01:41:06,094
no matter where he goes.

1534
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:08,725
We'll watch on this map until he stops.

1535
01:41:11,173 --> 01:41:13,198
- Sector 234.
- The signal is still strong.

1536
01:41:13,307 --> 01:41:15,104
- We still have a lock.
- We got them.

1537
01:41:15,209 --> 01:41:19,703
- Come on, baby.
- Thank you.

1538
01:41:19,815 --> 01:41:23,273
Lucy was the queen, baby. Think about it.

1539
01:41:23,386 --> 01:41:25,355
Lucille Ball was a bimbo. What are you talking about?

1540
01:41:25,454 --> 01:41:28,279
- Desi was the whole brains behind the whole thing.
- How could you say that?

1541
01:41:28,416 --> 01:41:29,523
What do you mean how could I say that?

1542
01:41:29,419 --> 01:41:32,219
You take those bongos away
from that guy, he's nothing.

1543
01:41:32,462 --> 01:41:34,692
It's conga. Don't be so stupid. It's Desi and Lucy...

1544
01:41:34,798 --> 01:41:36,699
Yo, what's up?

1545
01:41:36,801 --> 01:41:38,826
The fucking pencil squad.

1546
01:41:38,938 --> 01:41:40,565
Did you get us assigned to traffic duty?

1547
01:41:40,704 --> 01:41:45,732
- This is real. We got something for you.
- This shit could get you killed.

1548
01:41:49,751 --> 01:41:51,514
Let's go.

1549
01:42:01,332 --> 01:42:03,095
Here we go.

1550
01:42:04,602 --> 01:42:07,969
It's Conrad. I'm calling in a favor.

1551
01:42:10,976 --> 01:42:12,466
Eastbound towards northwest 135th Street.

1552
01:42:14,113 --> 01:42:16,343
Keep going northeast.

1553
01:42:16,449 --> 01:42:19,179
If I'm wrong about this, you can fire my ass.

1554
01:42:19,286 --> 01:42:21,413
This is what I need.

1555
01:42:21,522 --> 01:42:23,752
I need a SWAT team, helicopters...

1556
01:42:23,858 --> 01:42:27,625
We're calling all cars, baby. Only
I don't know where I need them.

1557
01:42:29,266 --> 01:42:34,101
- Very nice car you got there.
- Yeah. That's my toy.

1558
01:42:34,204 --> 01:42:36,570
I'm taking it with me, for my collection.

1559
01:42:36,673 --> 01:42:39,939
How about the wire transfers?

1560
01:42:41,213 --> 01:42:44,671
Two wire transfers to your banks...

1561
01:42:44,784 --> 01:42:47,947
totaling $180 million.

1562
01:42:49,089 --> 01:42:50,522
And 20 in cash.

1563
01:42:54,661 --> 01:42:56,959
Damn.

1564
01:43:01,769 --> 01:43:03,828
This has been a shitty week.

1565
01:43:05,107 --> 01:43:07,200
Getting full integration on that signal.

1566
01:43:12,548 --> 01:43:14,982
Yeah, we're on the airfield now.

1567
01:43:15,085 --> 01:43:17,316
I bet you it's up in the old hangar section.

1568
01:43:23,028 --> 01:43:24,461
Go ahead. Bring it up.

1569
01:43:26,632 --> 01:43:28,827
Deposit confirmation requested.

1570
01:43:28,934 --> 01:43:30,903
90 million, Geldersbank of Zurich.

1571
01:43:35,811 --> 01:43:37,210
No easy approach.

1572
01:43:37,312 --> 01:43:38,973
No time. Fuck the backup.

1573
01:43:39,081 --> 01:43:43,041
- We have to go now.
- Not a problem.

1574
01:43:46,123 --> 01:43:50,526
- Got an itch? I'd love to scratch it.
- Scratch this, ok?

1575
01:43:50,628 --> 01:43:54,302
I'll scratch whatever you want
me to, you blue-eyed bitch.

1576
01:43:54,415 --> 01:43:55,535
Did you go to college?

1577
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:07,280
Thank you.

1578
01:44:09,187 --> 01:44:12,054
- You sure you want to do this?
- Let's go.

1579
01:44:12,155 --> 01:44:13,679
Tuck in your skirt, baby. Come on!

1580
01:44:13,790 --> 01:44:15,655
My shit always works sometimes!

1581
01:44:20,130 --> 01:44:23,657
This is the best you can buy. It's
been nice doing business with you.

1582
01:44:35,048 --> 01:44:36,242
Oh, shit.

1583
01:44:37,384 --> 01:44:39,409
Fouchet, it's a setup!

1584
01:44:45,794 --> 01:44:48,524
If I get killed, I'm fucking you up!

1585
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:52,292
Goddamn it, go.

1586
01:44:55,508 --> 01:44:56,728
Go, goddamn it!

1587
01:45:09,032 --> 01:45:10,432
Ok, Ok...

1588
01:45:15,329 --> 01:45:16,455
My God!

1589
01:45:45,432 --> 01:45:47,059
Fuck, man!

1590
01:46:02,618 --> 01:46:03,738
Julie!

1591
01:46:12,967 --> 01:46:14,901
Mother...

1592
01:46:35,025 --> 01:46:36,652
Get down!

1593
01:46:38,430 --> 01:46:40,091
Shit!

1594
01:46:44,504 --> 01:46:46,165
You forgot your boarding pass.

1595
01:47:10,034 --> 01:47:12,332
You motherfuckers!

1596
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:17,303
- What's up?
- Oh, shit!

1597
01:48:10,875 --> 01:48:14,902
- Mike, let's go!
- Shit! Mike, get in the car!

1598
01:48:17,982 --> 01:48:20,042
Get in! Come on!

1599
01:48:20,828 --> 01:48:22,012
Let's go! Get in!

1600
01:48:22,532 --> 01:48:24,345
- Get in the car, goddamn it!
- Get in!

1601
01:48:23,890 --> 01:48:25,221
This shit's gonna blow!

1602
01:48:26,626 --> 01:48:27,923
Get up!

1603
01:48:49,686 --> 01:48:52,712
Oh, shit! Please catch that motherfucker!

1604
01:48:52,823 --> 01:48:54,848
- He shot me.
- He shot you ? He shot me.

1605
01:48:54,959 --> 01:48:56,894
- You all right?
- Just had a little run-in...

1606
01:48:56,996 --> 01:48:59,089
with your friend Jim Brown, but I'm fine.

1607
01:49:00,801 --> 01:49:05,067
He steals our shit, kidnaps Julie, shoots at my wife.

1608
01:49:05,171 --> 01:49:07,435
Oh, we beating him down!
We beating him down!

1609
01:49:11,012 --> 01:49:13,742
Marcus, I just got one question for you, bro.

1610
01:49:13,849 --> 01:49:16,511
How the hell you leave my ass
at a gunfight to go get the car?

1611
01:49:16,618 --> 01:49:19,610
You have got to shut up and let him drive!

1612
01:49:27,465 --> 01:49:30,127
Seems like that gunshot wound
has improved your driving skills.

1613
01:49:34,308 --> 01:49:36,037
You got the right to remain silent.

1614
01:49:38,512 --> 01:49:41,699
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

1615
01:49:41,777 --> 01:49:44,538
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Getting it out of the way.

1616
01:49:55,499 --> 01:49:56,864
Just punch it, man! Go!

1617
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:05,668
This car's faster!
This is a faster fucking car!

1618
01:50:05,776 --> 01:50:09,371
It's one or the other, baby!
It's gonna be him or it's gonna be us!

1619
01:50:13,186 --> 01:50:14,676
You better fucking win, that's all I know!

1620
01:50:14,788 --> 01:50:16,722
You better win!

1621
01:50:37,783 --> 01:50:40,013
Now that's how you supposed to drive!

1622
01:50:40,119 --> 01:50:43,350
From now on, that's how you drive!

1623
01:51:08,653 --> 01:51:10,883
Freeze!

1624
01:51:15,830 --> 01:51:17,457
He ain't even worth killing.

1625
01:51:22,256 --> 01:51:23,376
Freeze!

1626
01:51:49,632 --> 01:51:51,032
Fouchet...

1627
01:51:51,536 --> 01:51:54,267
I bet when your punk ass woke up this morning...

1628
01:51:54,376 --> 01:51:58,176
you didn't think about 5:00
you'd have a hole in your leg, did you?

1629
01:52:01,716 --> 01:52:04,617
You couldn't kill me, you chicken shit, could you?

1630
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:07,382
Oh no, I could. You're talking like it's over.

1631
01:52:07,491 --> 01:52:09,425
I was just pausing.

1632
01:52:09,558 --> 01:52:12,584
I'm starting to get the hang of this marksman shit.

1633
01:52:12,729 --> 01:52:16,756
Shooting them from 30 yards while
they're running away. No, that's not it.

1634
01:52:16,902 --> 01:52:20,483
Here's where it is, right here.
Point-blank, up close and personal.

1635
01:52:20,483 --> 01:52:21,603
Mike!

1636
01:52:22,041 --> 01:52:24,305
That's what I'm talking about.

1637
01:52:24,412 --> 01:52:26,039
Would you do it?

1638
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:28,080
Mike, step off.

1639
01:52:28,182 --> 01:52:34,293
Do it. Do it! Do it!

1640
01:52:40,264 --> 01:52:42,357
It's over.

1641
01:52:48,439 --> 01:52:51,840
He's a joke. He's a
motherfucking joke.

1642
01:53:16,673 --> 01:53:20,336
I ever tell you I love you, man?

1643
01:53:20,443 --> 01:53:24,505
Yeah, you always be getting emotional after gunfights.

1644
01:53:24,650 --> 01:53:26,709
It's 'cause I'm glad we survived.

1645
01:53:26,817 --> 01:53:28,842
Shit.

1646
01:53:28,954 --> 01:53:31,718
What are you talking about?

1647
01:53:31,858 --> 01:53:34,419
I love you too, man.

1648
01:53:34,528 --> 01:53:36,519
Don't be looking at me. I said, "I love you ."

1649
01:53:36,663 --> 01:53:39,325
- I said that shit.
- You my boy, man!

1650
01:53:39,467 --> 01:53:41,731
No, you like my brother, man.

1651
01:53:41,837 --> 01:53:44,032
So what am I?

1652
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:48,376
- Man...
- Julie, sweetie, you ...

1653
01:53:48,478 --> 01:53:50,412
You're a little dangerous.

1654
01:53:50,481 --> 01:53:54,850
Yeah, you're like a magnet for random gunfire.

1655
01:53:54,952 --> 01:53:57,352
But you're all right. You're cool.

1656
01:53:57,421 --> 01:53:59,219
You down.

1657
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:03,090
So what's next?

1658
01:54:06,533 --> 01:54:10,435
See, there ain't gonna be no next.

1659
01:54:10,505 --> 01:54:12,440
Whoa, Marcus. Come on.

1660
01:54:12,542 --> 01:54:16,273
You wanted Mike Lowrey. You got him.

1661
01:54:16,378 --> 01:54:19,575
Right here. That's Mike. Old Mike Lowrey.

1662
01:54:19,713 --> 01:54:23,479
I'm going home to my wife to get my quality time.

1663
01:54:23,619 --> 01:54:25,450
Marcus, why don't you
stop playing, man.

1664
01:54:25,555 --> 01:54:28,080
I been beat three times since we been out here.

1665
01:54:28,225 --> 01:54:32,594
I'm cool man. I don't need help.
Please, back up.

1666
01:54:32,730 --> 01:54:34,630
Why are you going home to your wife?

1667
01:54:34,732 --> 01:54:36,928
You got shot in the leg. Your
dick probably don't work.

1668
01:54:37,037 --> 01:54:39,437
Marcus, do you have the keys?

1669
01:54:39,539 --> 01:54:42,201
Mike wanted me to go to this gunfight.

1670
01:54:42,342 --> 01:54:44,936
Then there was this witness.

1671
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:49,111
My man! Sorry.

1672
01:54:49,251 --> 01:54:51,776
- Can you let me out of here?
- I don't have the keys.

1673
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:54,445
What do you mean you don't have no keys?
Why wouldn't you have keys?

1674
01:54:54,591 --> 01:54:56,456
Would you ... Ouch.

1675
01:54:56,559 --> 01:55:00,325
Marcus, I thought you said you loved me. Show me love!
