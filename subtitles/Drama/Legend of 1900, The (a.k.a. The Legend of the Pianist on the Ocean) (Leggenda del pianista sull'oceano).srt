- Really?

And the cook used to treat it.

show me what you've learned?

as much energy as an opponent would?

While the elephant is asleep,
The insect has the advantage.

as the elephant wakes...

to eliminate the insect!

And, yet again...

843

if the military
can take control of Shanghai...

it will weaken the elephant
in a big way.

Halt! General?

950
01:36:59,125 --> 01:37:02,333
Ambassador, the General, he's dead.

Come on! Police!
Don't move or I'll shoot!

953

- We okay here?
- Are you all right?

954
01:37:14,375 --> 01:37:18,208
Freeze! You are all
in the Japanese compound.

955
01:37:18,292 --> 01:37:20,417
You have no authority here.

956
01:37:20,542 --> 01:37:25,000
Soldier, these weapons
are all the authority we need.

957
01:37:25,125 --> 01:37:27,375
These men are Chinese,
and they're in our custody.

What? I order you
to turn them over!

- Don't move! Freeze!
- Hold it!

Now we'll see who gives
the orders in my country.

Stop it!

Everyone, hold your fire!

Now then, this argument
will be solved in a peaceful manner.

964
01:37:49,667 --> 01:37:51,625
The General is dead.

But there will be
no more lost lives!

- Yes, sir?

But, sir!

I'm the one that's in charge now.
Understand?

You will all do

Captain,
A Japanese general is dead.

I must know who killed him.

974
01:38:28,708 --> 01:38:32,708
Someone will be held responsible.

975
01:38:32,833 --> 01:38:34,833
Otherwise the military
won't let it go.

976
01:38:34,917 --> 01:38:40,083
You need a scapegoat
to prevent our countries going to war.

977
01:38:40,167 --> 01:38:42,167
Mmm.

978
01:38:46,458 --> 01:38:50,083
All right.
I'm going to be that man.

[Man]
No! He can't do that.

What's going on?

What did I tell you?
I knew the Japanese forces would--

989
01:39:51,708 --> 01:39:54,458
Lives were lost this time.
It's terrible.

990
01:39:54,583 --> 01:39:58,708
You know the Japanese soldiers
are responsible for this.

991
01:39:58,833 --> 01:40:01,708
I knew there'd be killing.
I tried to tell. No one listens to me.

992

Chen Zhen, he was the real hero.
Let me tell you.

He took on the Niguchi warriors,
and he beat them all!

I know.
I saw it myself.

995
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:15,000
Ahh. Then the soldiers shot him.

Who is it?

No one, no one.
Go on.

I can't believe you have to leave
Shanghai and start all over.
