1
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,470
(lighter clicks)

2
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,210
Ben: Do you think mom is hot?

3
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,880
Elliot: No. Not really.

4
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,280
Why?

5
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,310
I don't know.
She's not my type.

6
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,450
You don't think
she's pretty?

7
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,430
Like, even if
she wasn't mom?

8
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,330
Uh, look, every opinion
is subjective.

9
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,330
You know, maybe she's pretty
in the universal sense.

10
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,240
I mean, who the fuck knows?

11
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,430
I'm just saying she
doesn't do it for me.

12
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,910
Do you think other people
think she's hot?

13
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,410
I don't know.

14
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,910
I mean, some people
fucking like McDonald's.

15
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,440
I like McDonald's.

16
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,320
Right, and apparently,
you think mom is hot, so.

17
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,320
What took you so long?

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,350
Find yourself a nice morbidly
obese rest stop suitor

19
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,360
To take that much needed edge
off the family road trip?

20
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,090
- I just got that.
- Yeah, me too.

21
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,290
Mom?

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,360
Shut up and get
in the car, Elliot.

23
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,830
Ben, who gave you
money for that shit?

24
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,100
Ben: Dad.

25
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,700
Guess her bathroom tryst
was not satisfying.

26
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,840
(starts engine)

27
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,710
Seat belts.

28
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,010
We good?

29
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,350
Ben: Um, okay.

30
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,690
And action!

31
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,020
So, Lynn.
Where are we headed?

32
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,930
We're going to Annapolis,
Maryland.

33
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,450
Hmm. And why?

34
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,930
Why are we going
to Annapolis, Maryland?

35
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,200
Because my oldest son,
your brother,

36
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,430
Is getting married.

37
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,170
Hmm. Now what is his name?

38
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,870
Dylan.

39
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,880
And, um, his bride to be?

40
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,310
Does she hail from Annapolis?

41
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,210
Yes. She does.

42
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,110
And what is her name?

43
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,410
Her name is Heather, Elliot.
Heather.

44
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,850
And do you like this
Heather Elliot?

45
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,190
(laughs)
she's very sweet.

46
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,090
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

47
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,100
So then, you have
three sons, correct?

48
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,390
And a daughter.
Your sister Alice.

49
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,490
And does this-- this Alice.

50
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,330
Is she, uh, from
a previous marriage maybe

51
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,170
Or the current one?

52
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,870
She's from a previous one.

53
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,000
Hmm. And, um,
this daughter, Alice,

54
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,710
Does she live with you
or the ex-husband?

55
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,240
She lives with us, Elliot.

56
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,380
Hmm, and this Dylan character.

57
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,940
Let's return to him
for a moment.

58
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,180
Does he also reside with us?

59
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,850
That's not funny, Elliot.

60
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,220
Okay, well,
I'm not trying to be funny.

61
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,920
I'm just trying to
establish the residency

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,290
Of the two eldest children.

63
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,730
Yeah, well, I've had enough.

64
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,960
Okay, well,
maybe we'll circle

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,760
Back around to that
a little later.

66
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,290
We won't circle back
around to anything later.

67
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay, well, um,
moving right along then.

68
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,840
Moving right along.

69
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,680
Uh, let's see.
This daughter, Alice.

70
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,980
Is she coming to
the wedding?

71
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,850
Why are you doing
this, Elliot?

72
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,320
Why-- why am l--

73
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,850
You know, to document.
Document.

74
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,260
The-- the travels
and the wedding

75
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,320
And just family time.

76
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,060
I'm not interested.

77
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,220
In what? You're not interested
in keeping a record?

78
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:07,100
No.

79
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,040
Okay, then how will we know that
any of this even took place?

80
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,660
You know, that it existed.

81
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,930
That what took place?

82
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,930
The wedding.
All that surrounds matrimony.

83
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,280
I'm sure they hired
a videographer.

84
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,180
True, but those guys don't
really dig deep enough.

85
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,050
Okay, you know what, Elliot?
I have--

86
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,950
Mom! Watch out! Watch out!
Jesus fuck! Fuck.

87
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,010
Turn that fucking
camera off, Ben!

88
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,150
Turn it off!

89
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,090
(soft music plays)

90
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,190
Ben: Taylor, like, told me
that mom and dad

91
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,170
Bought grandma and
grandpa this house.

92
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,230
I don't wanna hear another
word from either of you

93
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,290
For the next 24 hours.

94
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,270
Ben: Well, is that,
like, true?

95
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,930
Do you think I'm kidding?

96
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,170
I will take away every fucking
privilege you have.

97
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,410
Oh ho, and you are
quite privileged.

98
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,040
That goes for you too, Elliot.

99
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,810
Alice gets here
in three days.

100
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,080
Please, I'm begging you.

101
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,050
Don't make this any more
difficult for me

102
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,250
Than it already is.

103
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,280
I won't.

104
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,850
And no smoking.

105
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,980
Your grandfather already
has one foot in the grave.

106
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,120
But not from smoking.

107
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,860
It doesn't matter.

108
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,190
Oh, and just so
you're prepared,

109
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,830
The last time you went to rehab,
I told them you were in Sweden.

110
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,130
Sweden? What?

111
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:22,130
Jesus. I don't know
anything about Sweden.

112
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,770
Oh, shit.

113
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,270
Oh. Fantastic.

114
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,110
What happened?

115
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,620
Dad's heart slowed
down again.

116
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,780
Was he okay?
Is he alive?

117
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,220
He's fine.
He's all right.

118
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,590
They're just making sure
everything's okay.

119
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,680
Don't go in there.

120
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,660
(voice fades)

121
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,390
Dad?

122
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,160
EMT: You can't say the
pacemaker doesn't do its job.

123
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,390
- Mom?
- He's stable, Doris.

124
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,830
Mom, are you okay?

125
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,360
Yes, I'm fine thanks,
don't worry.

126
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,240
EMT: Does that feel good?

127
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,110
(Joe moans softly)

128
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,150
(emergency radio chatter)

129
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,020
Well, I don't understand.
He has a heart attack--

130
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,710
No, no, no.
It wasn't a heart attack.

131
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,690
The fentanyl just set
off his pacemaker.

132
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,210
Slowed down his heart.

133
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,590
Yeah, well, why didn't you
take him to the hospital?

134
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,750
I mean, I don't think he--

135
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,690
Why don't you go
get settled now.

136
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,360
I know you're worried,
ma'am, but he's stable.

137
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,800
In fact, he's fine.

138
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,660
Just needs to rest up a bit.
Take it easy.

139
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,760
In the morning, Doris,
you can give his doctor a call.

140
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,930
See what he thinks,
but his vitals are solid.

141
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,670
Yeah. I know.

142
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,180
Thank you so much
for coming, Jason.

143
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,800
I really appreciate it.

144
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,010
Has that wife of yours
had the baby yet?

145
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,140
- Two more weeks.
- Oh, good.

146
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,780
I gotta tell you girls,
your mother is just a doll.

147
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,080
You. Thanks again.

148
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,590
- You're welcome.
- Hey, can I ask you something?

149
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,920
If you took one of these
say with, like, aderol

150
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,320
And you're about 130 pounds.

151
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,160
Could-- could you stroke?

152
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,630
When's dinner coming?

153
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,760
I don't know.
Just be patient.

154
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,230
So, man, you all right?
You feeling all right?

155
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,790
You look a little pale there.

156
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,330
You need vitamin d.
I read--

157
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,270
You read that report, Donna.

158
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,810
It's not like I'm sick, I'm just
not really into the sun.

159
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,040
So it's like a trend
or something?

160
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,100
I think it's the Goth thing.

161
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,770
No, it's not Goth.
I'm not Goth.

162
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,750
But you always wear black.

163
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,720
That's Goth. He's Goth.
Brandon, isn't Elliot Goth?

164
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,480
Oh, god, Donna, do you remember
when he was 12 years old?

165
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,710
I'm, not.

166
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,380
Brandon pantsed him,

167
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,550
He was wearing Lynn's
pantyhose under his jeans?

168
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,320
Donna: Hysterical!

169
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,120
You don't still do that,
do you?

170
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,670
Go from fried chicken
to grilled chicken.

171
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,830
- Food's here!
- It's here.

172
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,040
What it is, is global warming.

173
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,010
That's exactly what it is.
I'm telling you right now.

174
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,310
The record temperature,
the hottest summer ever

175
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,150
Was back in the 1950s.

176
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,740
Tell me how
that makes sense.

177
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,680
Where do you get this?

178
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,150
Actually, since 1880,

179
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,280
Average temperatures around
the world have risen

180
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,050
1.4 degrees Fahrenheit.

181
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,030
What is he?
Doogie Howser?

182
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,720
No, because Doogie Howser
was a resident surgeon.

183
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,260
I was scared to death when I saw
that ambulance in the driveway.

184
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,670
- He's in bad shape.
- He's not in bad shape.

185
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,570
He just hates sitting around
all day with nothing to do.

186
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,900
But he's a fighter, mother.
He is.

187
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,740
Lord knows,
we've been through this before.

188
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,830
You couldn't kill him with
a double barreled shotgun.

189
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,310
The doctor said his heart
only had 30% capacity.

190
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,680
Yeah, but he's
in good spirits.

191
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,770
Well, that's good.

192
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,250
(wheezes)
lack of oxygen!

193
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,710
(laughter, wine glass tapped)

194
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,220
I would just like
to say to everyone,

195
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,090
(no audible dialogue)

196
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,790
That I make fantastic Martinis.

197
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,920
Sit down.

198
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,830
(overlapping dialogue)

199
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,160
That's original recipe,
crispy, extra crispy.

200
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,010
Yo, wait until you see
Heather's friends, man.

201
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,750
Dude, your dick
will be dying, son.

202
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,550
It's fucking--
fucking fire.

203
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,890
My dick will be dying?

204
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,190
Tell you, man, these bitches
are fucking delish.

205
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,030
Just like top notch,
you know?

206
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,620
It's just that pussy
you dream of.

207
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,970
Intriguing.

208
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,530
Hope you don't mind, man.

209
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,560
I keefed the nuggs with
a little bit of llello.

210
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,670
No, it sure as shit
beats the two packs

211
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,640
Of coricidin cough & cold
I ate last night.

212
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,870
What do you mean Alice isn't
coming until Friday?

213
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,510
Nothing, just that Alice
will be here Friday.

214
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,240
The rehearsal dinner
is on Saturday.

215
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,950
I know that, Bonnie,
but everything will be fine.

216
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,750
Can't she come any earlier?

217
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,950
No, she can't.
She has things to do.

218
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,550
And-- and this way,

219
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,530
Lee doesn't have
to drive down tomorrow.

220
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,930
Lee is driving?
I thought he always hired a car.

221
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,090
Bonnie, please.
I just got here.

222
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,100
- Don't get all worked up, Lynn.
- I'm not getting worked up.

223
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,540
I'm just asking.

224
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,630
Could we please not
get into a whole thing?

225
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,640
Both: I'm not getting
into a whole thing!

226
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,770
Hey, ladies.
Can't we just get along?

227
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,280
Hey, who was it
that said that?

228
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,650
- The guy-- the police beating.
- Black guy.

229
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,080
Brandon: He's blind.

230
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,180
Ben: Who?

231
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,710
The dog.
Pinky bones.

232
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,950
Elliot: Thank Christ.

233
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,760
What a gift from god.

234
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,520
If the dog could see his outfit,
he'd fucking immolate himself.

235
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,530
My mom designed
that outfit.

236
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,090
She opened up a business.

237
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,900
Well, that's what she said.

238
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,170
I think it's a good idea.
Trying to be supportive.

239
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,470
(laughter)

240
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,610
Oh, this poor dog.

241
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,710
That's fucking fashion.

242
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,850
It's a dog, man.
That's abusive.

243
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,290
That's what I've always
said about Lynn.

244
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,020
She has to make
everything about her

245
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,960
And her family and her
problems and their issues.

246
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,930
It's not about her,
it's about Dylan.

247
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,590
It's his wedding.

248
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,620
He wants her at
the wedding, right?

249
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,140
He wants Alice
at the wedding.

250
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,930
And she has her therapist
so she can talk to Paul.

251
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,840
I mean, who goes to a therapist
to talk to their ex-husband?

252
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,710
I don't know why you ask me
these kinds of questions.

253
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,680
Well, 'cause Elliot's
doctors just wanted--

254
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,270
No, there isn't.

255
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,680
So nobody in your family
had any history of depression,

256
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,910
Or obsessive
compulsive disorder...

257
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,950
- No. No.
-...Severe an--

258
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,650
Well, where'd he come from, mom?
The planet Mars?

259
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,750
Oh, maybe so.

260
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,630
But didn't dad's dad
have some kind of a--

261
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,690
Didn't he drink heavily?

262
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,000
Well, yeah,
but that was, you know.

263
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,800
Did he die of drinking?

264
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,110
No, of course not.

265
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,580
He, um, you know.
He--

266
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,580
What?

267
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,480
He shot himself.

268
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,780
He shot himself?

269
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,190
Yeah.

270
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,280
Well, I'd say
that's something.

271
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,820
It was a different time, Lynn.
It was during the depression.

272
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,890
A lot of people
shot themselves.

273
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,460
You know, I wasn't
crazy about Sweden

274
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:57,130
I mean, it was--
it was freezing.

275
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,270
Really? Even in June?

276
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,870
Yeah, you know, maybe it was

277
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,000
Just my preconceived
notions of Sweden.

278
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,110
Pro-- probably.

279
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,910
It's probably just
psychosomatic.

280
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,220
- I have anxiety.
- Careful.

281
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,980
I'm on medication.

282
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,620
Well, we all know that.

283
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,860
Man on TV:
...Limited spectrum of our
intellect and what we are.

284
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,590
(snoring)

285
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,730
Man: Our ancestors struggled
and fought and died--

286
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,780
(hocs, spits)

287
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:59,160
Oh, no fucking way.

288
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,540
It's gonna be weird, like,
meeting mom's ex-husband.

289
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,410
I guess so.

290
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,780
I've never even, like,
seen a picture of him before.

291
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,580
I did.

292
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,010
Well, what's he look like?

293
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,020
Kind of generic.

294
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,150
Know who he looked like?
He looked like T.J.

295
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,750
Our old babysitter.

296
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:28,630
But didn't Paul used to be,
like, physically abusive?

297
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,800
Yeah, I think so.

298
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:37,030
So are you gonna,
like, kick his ass?

299
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,940
Ben--Ben, why would
I kick his ass?

300
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,500
I don't know.

301
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,280
'cause he, like,
used to hit mom and shit?

302
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,110
Yeah.

303
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,640
I've hit mom before.

304
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,430
(background TV chatter)

305
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,480
Come on.

306
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,680
Fuck.

307
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,980
Alice, are you sure you feel
strong enough to come down here?

308
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,980
No. Okay, okay.

309
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,790
Okay, I'm just asking.

310
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,620
No, no, that will be fine.

311
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:53,070
I am just going to talk
to Paul very calmly.

312
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,800
I'm gonna do just what
Dr. Marcus said to.

313
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,930
Why would there be a fight?

314
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,910
It's just going
to be me and Paul

315
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,470
And that-- that therapist
whose profile we saw online.

316
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,840
Don't worry, Alice.

317
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,910
Exactly, exactly.

318
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,650
That's the plan.
That's all. That's the plan.

319
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,520
(loud knocking)

320
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,420
(groans)

321
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,920
Jesus fuck.

322
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,360
(knocking)
dude, I gotta drop a deuce!

323
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,410
(knocking)

324
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,780
Oh, shit.

325
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:44,080
Donna, go ask your father
what he wants for breakfast.

326
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,350
Come on, come on.

327
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,410
Let's go see.
Let's go see.

328
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,010
Let's go see what
granddad wants.

329
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,650
- Say hello, granddaddy!
- Oh, hi, baby.

330
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,920
Hey. Daddy, what do you
want for breakfast?

331
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,590
A bowl of life.

332
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,530
Ah, we're all out of life.

333
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,970
Oh.

334
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,300
Are you crying?

335
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,000
- No, no, no. That, it's--
- are you sure?

336
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,870
Yes.

337
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:14,400
Okay, well, what do you
want for breakfast?

338
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,480
Pancakes. Well done.

339
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,390
Okay, come on.
Who's a stinky pinky?

340
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,380
Say I'm a stinky pinky.
Boo-do-boo-do-boo. Yay.

341
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,050
I think daddy's been crying.

342
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,000
Was he watching
the price is right?

343
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,900
Yeah.

344
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,420
It's that darn home
defibrillator

345
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,560
Commercial they
always play.

346
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,700
It just makes him
so emotional.

347
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,600
Did he say what he
wants for breakfast?

348
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,600
Delicious. Mmmm.
Yeah, pancakes. Well done.

349
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,640
Have you eaten?

350
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,610
No, I have to go get ready.

351
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,010
For what?

352
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,020
I'm-- I'm gonna go see Paul.

353
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,920
Oh. I just don't get it.

354
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,550
What don't you get, mom?

355
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,720
I think you're just
asking for trouble.

356
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,320
I don't understand why we
can't just have a nice time.

357
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,830
Mom, l--

358
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,960
You always have to stir
the pot, don't you?

359
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,310
(toilet flushing)

360
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,900
What're you doing
in my bathroom?

361
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,410
I was just
dropping a deuce.

362
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,940
- A what?
- A deuce.

363
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,850
Like, deuce deuce,
which is, like,

364
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,350
Gangsta rap for tony 2 pistol,

365
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,410
But subtract one deuce
and you just get 2?

366
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,220
Like, the number?

367
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,320
Dropping a number 2?

368
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,830
Taking a poop?

369
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,620
What is wrong with you?

370
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,890
Well, I was
diagnosed with--

371
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,990
I know what you were
diagnosed with, Ben.

372
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,900
I'm your mother.

373
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,840
Is it my genes?
Is it my--

374
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,900
Am I a bad mother?

375
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,920
Well, actually,
I was thinking about it,

376
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,850
And both Elliot
and I have problems,

377
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,980
So I was wondering if it was
dad's genes, you know?

378
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,460
But then Alice is
also fucked up, so--

379
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,650
Don't cuss, Ben.

380
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,680
Sorry, I won't, but, like,

381
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,700
The only one who
is normal is Dylan.

382
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,290
And you didn't raise
him, like, at all.

383
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,030
So I concluded that
it must be you.

384
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:21,370
'cause, like, you're the
only common denominator.

385
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,110
I love you so much.

386
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,780
Come here.
Give me hug.

387
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,990
Did you wash your hands?

388
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,460
Mmm-hmm.

389
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,860
Okay, go ahead.

390
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,600
(door opens, closes)

391
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,900
I'm-- I'm on my way now.

392
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,500
- Bye. Uh-huh.
- Bye.

393
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:03,420
Ben, will you come take these
to your grandfather, please?

394
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,860
You know this whole
well done pancake thing,

395
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,560
It's just been in the
last two weeks.

396
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,970
His whole life, he liked
them golden and fluffy.

397
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:28,340
Now he wants them blacker than
the lady on the syrup bottle.

398
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,810
(laughs)
mom, you are such
a southern girl.

399
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,780
Don't tell anyone
I said that.

400
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,380
Whatever, you're, like, twice
as old as civil rights anyway.

401
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,940
(laughs)

402
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,450
Just take a tile, Donna.

403
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,890
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

404
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,520
So was granddaddy still crying
when you went in there?

405
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,690
I don't know.
He wasn't there.

406
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,260
(big band swing plays)

407
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,900
(indistinct shouting)

408
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,710
All right, blood.
Come on to the head.

409
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,010
Granddad?

410
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,610
Granddad's not here.

411
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,620
Whatever.

412
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,390
(yawns)

413
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,570
Daddy, you in here?

414
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,010
Oh.

415
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,380
- Sorry.
- (stammers)

416
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,360
Okay, sorry.

417
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,490
Hello, Lynn.
I'm Dr. Stanwyck.

418
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,290
It's nice to meet you.

419
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:54,950
Come on in.

420
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,260
Thanks.

421
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,460
- Hello, Lynn.
- Hey.

422
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,400
- You look great.
- Thank you.

423
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,700
Hi, Lynn.

424
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,630
Hi. I didn't realize that--

425
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,900
Of course, don't be silly.
Why wouldn't I be here?

426
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,270
You did say that this
was a family crisis.

427
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,780
Yeah, I told Paul
it was pressing.

428
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,330
Exactly.

429
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,570
Let's all sit down.

430
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,420
So as Lynn explained
to me over the phone,

431
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,220
Your son, Dylan--

432
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,990
Our son.
Our son.

433
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,220
Right, right.
I understand.

434
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,530
Dylan and Alice are the
children you and Paul had, Lynn.

435
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,690
Now, Dylan has asked Alice

436
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,200
To be the maid of honor
at his wedding Sunday.

437
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,670
Is that right so far?

438
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,610
- Yes.
- That's right, that's right.

439
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,580
And, um, Alice--

440
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,870
It's not a very easy time
for her right now.

441
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,310
So, I was thinking that
it'd be a good idea

442
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:52,610
If Paul and I could, um,

443
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,590
Talk through some issues
before she came down on Friday.

444
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,420
Daddy!

445
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,160
Daddy!

446
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,360
Where are you?

447
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:07,920
How is any of
this my fault?

448
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,730
It's not your fault.

449
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,600
I haven't seen or spoken
to my daughter in 7 years.

450
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,230
And I have no clue as to why.

451
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,400
- It's not what I wanted.
- No, it's what Alice wanted.

452
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,310
Is that really what Alice wanted
or is that what you wanted?

453
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,710
You certainly haven't
made any effort

454
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,410
To make it any better over
the last 7 years.

455
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,940
If that's even the truth,

456
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,610
Then I will ask Alice
to explain it to me.

457
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,880
Because I wanna start
resolving this once and for all

458
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,690
And put it behind us.

459
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:35,460
No, that is exactly what I'm
trying to get you not to do.

460
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,360
Lynn...

461
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,800
Not speak with
his daughter?

462
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,200
...Is this some sort of scheme

463
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,670
To get me down here to tell me

464
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,500
That I can't speak to my own
daughter at my son's wedding?

465
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,810
Maybe this isn't for you
to decide anymore.

466
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,810
Maybe that's what
you're afraid of.

467
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,840
I mean, Alice is old enough
to decide herself.

468
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,510
That's right.

469
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,520
This is between me
and Alice, Lynn.

470
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,210
It doesn't concern you.

471
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,410
Patty, seriously,

472
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,220
This has absolutely nothing
to do with you.

473
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,520
I think this has everything
to do with me.

474
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,550
I am her stepmother.

475
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,080
How could you be
her stepmother

476
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,320
When she doesn't even
consider him her father?

477
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,730
- Well, he is.
- No, he isn't.

478
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,860
- Yes, he is.
- Yes, I am.

479
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,560
No, you're not.

480
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,870
Being a father entails
certain responsibilities.

481
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,840
Patty: Yeah, so
does being a mother.

482
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,570
Okay, everybody, look.

483
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,340
I understand this is an
emotionally charged issue,

484
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:26,310
But let's try to stay
on course here.

485
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:29,750
I don't think Lynn means to say
that what Alice is going through

486
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,150
Is your fault, Paul.

487
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,580
Paul: Fine.

488
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,140
But I should be able
to talk to my daughter...

489
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,620
Yes, you should.

490
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,920
...About whatever's
going on in her life.

491
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,930
If my daughter
is going through

492
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,550
Some sort of self-destructive
phase then I want to he--

493
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,790
Wait, what, what?
You think this is a phase?

494
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,300
- That's not what he said.
- That's exactly what he said!

495
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,360
It's not what he meant.

496
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,370
I'm just trying
to protect my daughter.

497
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,460
- From who?
- From what?

498
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,910
From you!

499
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,140
- What did he--?
- I just explained it to you!

500
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,010
You just so enjoy trying
to tear this family apart.

501
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,710
Isn't that what
this is all about?

502
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,150
So that's his story now?

503
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,310
Is that the story you tell
everybody, Paul?

504
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:10,850
That I wanted to leave
alone with my daughter

505
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,860
And not raise my son.

506
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,390
Is that what you told her when
you were crying on her shoulder?

507
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,460
Did you leave out the part

508
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,860
Where you said,
go, Lynn, go?

509
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,840
Go and take Alice.

510
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:26,700
But if you take Dylan,
I'll take both your kids.

511
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,570
- What else did you leave out?
- All I know is that...

512
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,580
...I love my daughter.

513
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:33,210
And apparently,
she doesn't know that, Lynn,

514
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,370
And I don't understand it.

515
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,750
I don't understand that.

516
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,780
I don't give a fuck
what you understand,

517
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,620
Because what I know
is that my daughter

518
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,620
Has been silently slicing
at her arms and legs

519
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,290
With a straight-edged
razor for six years.

520
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,800
A straight-edged razor!

521
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:55,460
Now what don't you understand,
you solipsistic fuck?

522
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,570
Daddy?

523
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,510
(sobbing)
daddy?

524
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,510
Scared.

525
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,510
Daddy?

526
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:10,180
Oh, daddy.
Oh, my god.

527
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,580
Daddy.

528
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,320
What the hell are
you doing out here?

529
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,760
Don't say that word.

530
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:22,630
Third time in a month.

531
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,790
I just can't take it anymore.

532
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,630
Are you filming this?

533
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,730
Ben: Um--

534
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,670
Oh.

535
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,640
You're treating me
like an animal.

536
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,800
Well, that's
what's going on.

537
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,080
It's either this, daddy,
or the old folks home.

538
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,170
You make the choice.
Okay.

539
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,840
Okay, boys lift it.

540
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,550
I'm not an animal.

541
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,780
(background chatter)

542
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,220
She's running a little late.

543
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,280
I hope you're ready because
we have so much planned.

544
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,730
Brandon.
How you doing, buddy?

545
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,220
Heather looks beautiful.
She lost a lot of weight.

546
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,810
Yeah.
She looks great.

547
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,620
I saw Paul today.

548
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:29,360
Dad told me.
How'd it go?

549
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,620
Oh, it went very well.

550
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,220
I think we're really
making progress.

551
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,960
Yeah. Really?

552
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,630
Oh, doesn't he look wonderful?

553
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,640
How long has it been
since you've seen him?

554
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,940
- Six months?
- Four months.

555
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,410
Six months. Well.

556
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,180
I'm glad that at least you have
this little bit of time

557
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,940
To spend with your mother.

558
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,390
Shit.

559
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:01,450
Patty keeps asking me if I'm
gonna walk her to her seat.

560
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,360
Oh. Absolutely.
I understand completely.

561
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,070
Are you kidding me?

562
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,130
You're my mother.

563
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,270
(overlapping dialogue)

564
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,570
Ugh. I bet she has something
ridiculous like a vibrator

565
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,340
On the bed or something
ridiculous, she's disgusting.

566
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,710
Listen, listen.
So I open the bathroom door,

567
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:26,740
And I find Elliot in the buff,

568
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,810
Completely naked...

569
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,080
(laughter)

570
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,780
Putting on Lynn's lipstick.

571
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,560
(loud laughter)

572
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,730
(background chatter, music)

573
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,670
Ben: Hey. What's up?

574
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,800
Just bonding with family.

575
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,440
But they're
all over there.

576
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,740
Yes, Ben.
I realize that.

577
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,050
Thank you.

578
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:59,250
So, uh, what're
you doing then?

579
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:02,190
Nothing, Ben.

580
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,180
I'm doing absolutely nothing.

581
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,690
Does everyone seem
happy out there?

582
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,360
Yeah, of course, dad.

583
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,070
Um, the grass.

584
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,690
Does it seem a bit
overgrown to you?

585
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,170
No, not at all.

586
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,430
Landscapers do a great job.

587
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,460
You don't have to
worry about that.

588
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,170
It's my property.

589
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,640
I feel like I should be
taking care of it myself.

590
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,480
Yeah, but it's a good thing
that you don't have to, right?

591
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:34,680
You know that Elliot hasn't
even said a word to me?

592
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,520
What?

593
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,750
Didn't even say hello.

594
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,590
You know Elliot's--

595
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:42,860
Elliot's having a tough time.

596
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,660
17 is not an easy age.

597
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,500
I don't understand what's
so tough about his life.

598
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,760
He's a good looking kid,

599
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,700
You got all the money
in the world,

600
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,400
And he goes to all
the best schools.

601
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,200
He gets thrown out
of the best schools, dad.

602
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,710
You guys are just too
lenient with him.

603
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,480
You don't discipline
him enough.

604
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,810
He has to have
some consequences.

605
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,690
Okay, we do discipline him.

606
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:11,020
Elliot has a chemical imbalance
in his brain.

607
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,360
It's real.

608
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,590
He has depression,

609
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,530
Obsessive compulsive
disorder,

610
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,720
He has Tourette's
syndrome for god's sake.

611
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,060
He suffers from
severe anxiety

612
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,500
And he has difficulty
managing his emotions.

613
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:28,270
Now he's in therapy
and he's doing much better.

614
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,510
If you say so, baby.

615
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,410
TV host: Hello, Tiffany.
Are you over the shock yet?

616
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,470
Tiffany: I am.
Host: Ready to play?

617
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,710
Tiffany: I am, thank you.

618
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,380
Host: Okay, I wanna
start you off--

619
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,150
Announcer: They're slashing
regular health care

620
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,250
Like cancer surgery
or having a broken leg fixed--

621
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,190
(background chatter)

622
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:50,920
Did you see the girl,
remember Brandon was talking to?

623
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,590
(background chatter)

624
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:57,140
Life is just
closing in on you, Dylan.

625
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,800
No. No.
She's cool.

626
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,970
What? You're just gonna keep
saying it over and over again?

627
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,500
You know this isn't Peter Pan.

628
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,240
We can all clap our hands
and say we believe,

629
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,410
But it still doesn't mean
you're gonna enjoy

630
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:11,150
Only having sex with Tinkerbell
for the rest of your life.

631
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,020
(laughs)

632
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,110
Tinkerbell's hot, man.

633
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,590
Tinkerbell's very small.

634
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,450
Oh, yeah, yeah.

635
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,080
What're you doing
later tonight?

636
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,630
- I don't know.
- I don't know, man.

637
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,990
Maybe I'll have a drinking
contest with granddad.

638
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,430
You know, every time
there's a fox news alert

639
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,160
We could throw back
a shot of prune juice.

640
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,760
- First to shit loses.
- All right, all right.

641
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,100
Think I'll win?

642
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,130
Well, if you fucking
get bored of that...

643
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,330
- lmpossible.
-...We're gonna go to a party.

644
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,640
- Oooh.
- You should come.

645
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,010
Yeah, good deal.

646
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,200
I should tell my mom,
but she'll be cool.

647
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,150
Yeah, we're gonna get out.

648
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,780
We'll fucking roll out of here
in, like, 20 minutes, so.

649
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,040
Yeah, I should probably
take a shower.

650
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,450
I haven't showered in,
like, a week.

651
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Take a shower. You know.

652
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,620
You know, um--

653
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,560
You know, wash that hair
and, uh,

654
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,650
Throw on a little bit
of mommy's lipstick.

655
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:58,060
Whatever it is that you need to
do to get ready for the night.

656
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,760
Look there's--

657
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,700
There's a lot more
to that though.

658
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,200
Just fucking with you.

659
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,640
You'll get a kick out
of the real story.

660
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,040
I'm just fucking with you, man.
I'm not trying to--

661
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,560
Just sayin'.

662
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,630
(overlapping dialogue)

663
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,050
Whatever it is you like
to do, do it.

664
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,380
You made a very
big mistake.

665
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,980
Who're you talking to?

666
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,280
Your father.

667
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,720
Oh, cool.

668
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,280
So, listen, I'm thinking
I'm going to go out

669
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,380
With Brandon later.

670
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:31,450
Lee, let me call you
back in a minute.

671
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,190
Nope. It's 10 P.M.

672
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,230
So?

673
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,290
What do you mean, so?

674
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,030
Well, I mean why
can't I go?

675
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,440
Because I said so.

676
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,210
Because Brandon
is five years older

677
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,980
And I don't like you
hanging out with him.

678
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,040
So what am I supposed to do?

679
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,140
Sit around and play
fucking rummy cube

680
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:55,420
With your demented family?

681
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,150
You could spend some time
with your grandfather.

682
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:02,650
Oh, great. Yeah.
The guy's a fucking zombie.

683
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,930
Don't be so mean, Elliot.

684
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,260
Oh, well, sorry, mom.

685
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,160
He watches fox news
while he sleeps.

686
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,360
That's like the textbook
definition of zombie.

687
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,980
Have you been drinking?

688
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:22,880
No. Of course not.

689
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:28,080
Have you been doing
any drugs with Brandon?

690
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,290
No. I fucking promise.

691
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,450
Don't lie to me, Elliot.

692
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,720
I'm not lying to you, mom.

693
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,390
Then why are you acting out?

694
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:42,390
I'm not acting out.

695
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,370
Elliot, I swear to god,

696
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,930
If you have relapsed,

697
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,410
You're going right back
to Silver Hill.

698
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,240
I can't take
any more chances.

699
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,970
I'm not! Mom!

700
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:56,110
Just stop being such
a fucking bitch!

701
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,170
Don't talk to me that way!

702
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,150
Then stop accusing me
of shit I didn't do!

703
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,590
Okay, just lower your voice.

704
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:08,020
Why do you gotta be
such a fucking bitch?

705
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,530
What the fuck
is your problem?

706
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,160
Elliot, back away.

707
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,630
- Why? I'm not doing anything.
- Just back away now.

708
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,290
- I'm not doing anything.
- Elliot, please.

709
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,130
- I'm not doing anything.
- Just back away.

710
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:20,000
- You fucking cunt!
- No, no, no!

711
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,480
(crying)

712
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,300
(crying continues)

713
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:31,150
(sings)
Jack be nimble,
Jack be quick,

714
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:34,350
Jack go under the limbo stick.

715
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:39,220
(crying continues)

716
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,030
Yo, bachelor party.

717
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,050
Shit's gonna be
off the ho-ok.

718
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,690
Oh, my bad, my bad.

719
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,220
Not cool.

720
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,130
Yo, where'd that
nigga Elliot go?

721
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:56,400
Lynn: It's just so scary.
Doesn't it scare you?

722
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,040
Are you even aware of it
when it's happening?

723
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,270
Yeah, but it's like--

724
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,550
It's like this
switch gets flipped.

725
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,490
And something snaps
inside of me and l--

726
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,450
And--

727
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:15,190
Well, where does
it come from?

728
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:20,220
Because your reactions
to things are so extreme

729
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:23,130
It's just not normal.

730
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,610
It's like--

731
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,100
The moment I get here,
I'm forced to lie.

732
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,480
Lie about being
in fucking Sweden

733
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,210
And, you know,

734
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:39,240
Trying to hide the fact
that I have fucking issues.

735
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:42,780
So you can't--
you can't escape.

736
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,590
I know.

737
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,320
Like they only see you
in these stages.

738
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,560
These intermittent
stages of your life,

739
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,360
Which are usually embarrassing

740
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,660
Because growing up
fucking sucks.

741
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,300
They just cling on to them

742
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:02,540
And bring them up
whenever you're around.

743
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,970
That's because
that's all they have.

744
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,350
They don't know you, Elliot.

745
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:16,620
So, it's just like, the only
thing that ties us together

746
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:20,890
Are these horrible, fucking
moments of our lives.

747
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,190
I mean shit you wish had
never happened.

748
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,390
It's like everything
you're trying to avoid.

749
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,560
You don't want Alice
to come here

750
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,590
And deal with all the traumatic
shit of her childhood

751
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,010
And you're trying
to explain to them

752
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,600
That this could be really
fucking detrimental

753
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,040
But they don't understand.

754
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,940
They never will.

755
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,480
So you drive yourself crazy,

756
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,550
Alice cuts herself
and I just...

757
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:54,250
Turn into fucking
glenn beck.

758
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,840
So...

759
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:08,470
Are you gonna tell
dad about this?

760
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:14,980
Yeah, I have to.

761
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,980
(loud thunder, rain)

762
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:24,280
(wind howling)

763
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,020
(distant thunder)

764
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,840
(distant hammering)

765
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:54,100
(hammering continues)

766
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,840
(background chatter)

767
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,510
It's exactly where
it's supposed to be.

768
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,950
(overlapping dialogue)

769
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,290
I'm Lynn Hellman.

770
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,550
Uh, hi.
Foreman Fred.

771
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:09,060
May I help you with anything?

772
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,930
Well, not unless
you have a solution

773
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,930
On how to get a twelve foot
stake into the ground

774
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,830
Without damaging
the irrigation system.

775
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,000
Did you just wake up?

776
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,160
No.

777
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,810
You know, I was just thinking
that maybe the tent

778
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,240
Wasn't in the
right position.

779
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,910
That maybe if we move it
and if you face it this way--

780
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:31,080
We, Lynn, um, spent a lot of
time with Dylan and Heather

781
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,850
Going over all this.

782
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:34,280
I'm sure they would've
appreciated your input

783
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,980
About a month ago,
but irregardless,

784
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,220
I think that Fred and I've
got it covered, don't we?

785
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,820
We certainly do.

786
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:43,090
Of course, I have taken
orders from this little lady

787
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,260
For how many years?

788
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,930
- 15 years?
- Oh, jesus.

789
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,400
Am I getting old?

790
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,530
You, on the other hand,
you haven't aged a day.

791
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,330
Well, you know I'm not gonna
ever let you see me

792
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,170
Without my full
fluff and fold.

793
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,440
And a mighty fine
fluff and fold it is.

794
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,910
Oh, you.
You are a sweetheart.

795
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,910
You're gonna get me
in trouble with Paul.

796
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:05,510
I think this pollen
is giving me a migraine now.

797
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:08,210
I'm just gonna go inside.
Go inside.

798
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,850
Well I'll make sure
and share your thoughts

799
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,320
With Heather and Dylan.

800
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,980
I know they'll
appreciate it.

801
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,990
Donna.
Donna!

802
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,430
Donna?

803
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,930
- Like that hat, Donna!
- Thank you, thank you.

804
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,330
I can not the way she just
waltzed on to our property.

805
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:24,170
Somebody had to help
Heather with the wedding.

806
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,930
- Her mother has lupus.
- It's not lupus.

807
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,340
She says it's lupus.
It's chronic fatigue.

808
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,000
We all know what
that's about.

809
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,910
Whatever it is,
she can't help at all.

810
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:34,110
It's just so sad.
Poor Heather.

811
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,210
Paul's company put up
the entire tent for free.

812
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,910
Saved her family a fortune.

813
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,040
All that flirting is so
inappropriate.

814
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:44,490
And that-- and that--
that tarzan outfit.

815
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,890
Lynn, you're wearing a robe.

816
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:48,920
- I just woke up.
- Oh.

817
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,550
I had a horrible
night's sleep.

818
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,890
Don't get defensive.
No one cares.

819
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,420
No one cares.

820
00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:00,870
Ben: Do you think Alice,
like, might wanna kill herself?

821
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,900
Elliot: No, of course not.

822
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,270
But, like, one day
do you think she'll--

823
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:09,250
No, Ben. No.

824
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,250
She's gonna be fine.

825
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:15,280
I guess.

826
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,910
No, totally.

827
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,450
All right?

828
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,990
I was wondering,

829
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:28,090
Do you think autistic
people know they're autistic?

830
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,500
I think it depends
on how severe it is,

831
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:37,100
But in most cases,
I imagine so.

832
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,300
Yeah, because,

833
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:42,470
I know I was diagnosed with,
like, mild Asperger's syndrome,

834
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,420
But I didn't think
I was autistic.

835
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:50,910
No, you're definitely not.
Why? Did someone say that?

836
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,750
Yeah.

837
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:55,890
Donna was talking about
it to Bonnie and grandma.

838
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:57,560
With you in the room?

839
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,160
Yeah, but they
were whispering.

840
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,260
They didn't know I could hear.

841
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,730
But I've got, like,
amazing hearing.

842
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:08,760
I mean, like, I could
hear shit below 20 Hertz.

843
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:10,740
I just don't understand

844
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,370
Why you have to redesign
the whole dress.

845
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:15,240
I'm just putting
sleeves on it, mom.

846
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,340
It's not that big a deal.

847
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,350
Maybe not to you.

848
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,110
What's that
supposed to mean?

849
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:23,760
All I'm saying is that
I think that Alice

850
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,490
Would like to fit in
with the rest of the party

851
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:28,890
Rather than standing out
like a sore thumb.

852
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:38,100
Okay, you know what?
This is not up for debate.

853
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,110
Now don't get all
huffy and puffy.

854
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,800
I'm not getting
all huffy and puffy.

855
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,540
Now, you're in a state.
Am I right?

856
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:48,840
(phone rings)

857
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:55,150
Hello? Oh, hi, Paul.

858
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:57,160
Oh, it's fantastic.

859
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:59,990
We're all so
excited around here.

860
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:02,050
Yeah, right.

861
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:07,400
Joe, he's--
he's getting weaker.

862
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,330
Yeah, he keeps--

863
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:13,000
I once saw this PBS special with
all these great doo-wop singers.

864
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,060
Donna, please, shhh.

865
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,010
What? Oh, Paul?

866
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,310
She'll be on the phone
for at least 20 minutes.

867
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:21,010
- They do this every couple--
- I know that.

868
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:24,820
Yeah, that's Lynn.

869
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,410
(mom laughs)

870
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:31,360
Doris: I know. Oh, yeah.
That's right. Oooh, when?

871
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:33,650
I could just about
kill you right now.

872
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,320
In that case,
you'll have to pop inside.

873
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,490
I'll make you a cup of coffee.

874
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,970
Good. All right.

875
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,270
Well then I'll see the two of
you real soon, huh?

876
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,970
Okay, Paul, say hello
to the girls for me.

877
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:50,310
Yeah. Bye-bye.

878
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:00,980
Mom?

879
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,250
Mmm?

880
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:04,220
Mom, what did you just do?

881
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,720
What?

882
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,950
Did you just
invite them over?

883
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:11,660
Oh, good lord.

884
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,360
Are you pretending
to be oblivious,

885
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,130
Or do you really
not get it?

886
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,760
Get what?

887
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,530
How that might
make me feel?

888
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:24,300
Suddenly,
there was such a racket.

889
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:27,800
Seems like every guy on the ship
was yelling his head off.

890
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,750
So I got out of the room,
I ran up the stairs.

891
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:34,650
All the way up to the top deck
to see what was going on,

892
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,960
And there's a woman
standing there.

893
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,420
So I look over
and I'm looking.

894
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,400
And all of a sudden,
I realize

895
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:49,830
That's Doris

896
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:52,700
Standing there waiting for me.

897
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,610
Granddad?

898
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:11,310
Dude, did he
just die on camera?

899
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:16,290
Donna: It's okay.

900
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:17,800
You don't joke about that.

901
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:19,890
Elliot: Look, I'm sorry.

902
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:22,920
I didn't-- I didn't mean to
cause any sort of--

903
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:24,330
False alarm, don't worry.

904
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:25,960
- What happened?
- He did look dead, though.

905
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:27,030
Ben: He looked, like,
really dead.

906
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:28,730
Did something happen to dad?

907
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:31,830
- No.
- Yeah, something did happen.

908
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,240
No, nothing happened.

909
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,110
Something happened.
We thought he was dead.

910
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:38,050
- Elliot--
- we have it on camera.

911
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,350
What did you do
to him, Elliot?

912
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:41,750
What did I do--
nothing, mom.

913
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,690
What're you doing
with that camera?

914
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:46,820
Okay, he was telling a story
about World War II, and--

915
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,220
You brought up politics?

916
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,290
No, I didn't bring
up politics.

917
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:52,850
- For fuck's sake.
- Elliot!

918
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,200
Oh, you guys have never
heard the fuck word before?

919
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:57,670
Okay, Elliot,
just go to your room.

920
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,930
Mom, I'm not six years old
and I don't have a room.

921
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:01,100
This isn't my house.

922
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,510
Last I heard,

923
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:04,910
Your name was on
the fucking title.

924
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:07,380
Oh, oh, oh.
(gaps)

925
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,810
- You are a real asshole.
- Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

926
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:13,150
- You know that.
- I wasn't supposed to say it.

927
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:15,210
Okay, just get out.
Get out.

928
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:18,620
- Get out!
- Yeah, I'm on my way.

929
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:22,720
- Hey, aren't you--
- eat shit, Paul.

930
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,820
Some manners that kid has.

931
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,330
Oh, fuck you, Paul.

932
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:33,300
I'm sorry, I apologize.
I'm sorry.

933
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:37,830
Um, would anyone
like some tea or coffee?

934
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:40,070
Pass those, would you, dear?

935
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:43,170
(overlapping dialogue)

936
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:45,050
- Paul wants some.
- Oh, they look delicious.

937
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:49,350
Wait till you all see Alice.
Oh, god. What a beauty.

938
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:51,980
And she's just
as smart as a whip.

939
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,650
Really quick, yeah.

940
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:56,320
Really looking forward to having
a conversation with her.

941
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:00,630
Although, Lynn doesn't think
it's such a good idea.

942
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,260
I didn't say that, Paul.

943
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,360
Good. I'm glad there's
no problem then.

944
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,570
I'm just trying to make sure
Alice doesn't walk into

945
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:10,510
A, um, emotionally
volatile atmosphere.

946
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:14,100
It's a wedding, Lynn.
Weddings aren't volatile.

947
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:15,910
(light laughter)

948
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:18,780
You know, Paul, I don't think
you really understand

949
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,150
Just how fragile
Alice is right now.

950
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:22,280
And it's not your fault.

951
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,020
At all.

952
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,250
You see, the psychology
of self-injuring

953
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:28,230
Is very complicated.

954
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:32,030
And I think what
Alice is-- was doing

955
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:36,020
In her case is she was
trying to convert

956
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:39,770
Her emotional pain
into something tangible.

957
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:42,270
Like a physical pain.

958
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:46,040
I--I think we do understand.

959
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:50,610
Usually this kind of thing is
about seeking attention.

960
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,980
(heavy sigh)

961
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,080
What, did I say
something stupid?

962
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,420
- Okay, Patty, could I just--
- no.

963
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,550
It has become
a fad these days.

964
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:01,150
It's not a fad.

965
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:05,690
- I think that--
- I don't care what you think.

966
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:09,030
I am just trying
to explain to you

967
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:11,430
What's going on
with our daughter.

968
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:13,100
And I think in her case,

969
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,230
It's about her trying
to gain control.

970
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:17,740
Over what?

971
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,180
Over everything.

972
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,580
Everything in this
child's entire life

973
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:23,280
Has been beyond her control.

974
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,910
Our divorce,

975
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:27,680
The fact that she was forced
to spend summers with you.

976
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,120
The fact that she grew up
without her brother.

977
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,090
All of it. She had no
control over any of it.

978
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:35,560
Doris: But you did.

979
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,530
No, mom. I didn't.

980
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:52,070
Paul, tell me if I'm crazy,

981
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:56,670
Because I really don't remember
anymore, I really don't.

982
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,240
I mean, I blocked
so much of it out

983
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,910
That I don't know what's
true and what's not.

984
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:05,580
The night before I left,

985
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,620
We were in the kitchen

986
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:11,030
And you were screaming at me
about something, l--

987
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,030
I think you--

988
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:15,660
I think you lost your
keys or something.

989
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,070
And Alice was
holding on to my leg.

990
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:22,300
And you were screaming.
You were really screaming.

991
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:25,330
And she was terrified.
She wouldn't let go.

992
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,870
And then you grabbed me
by my shirt,

993
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:31,940
And you punched me
in the face.

994
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,680
You grabbed me by my shirt

995
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,950
And you punched me
right in the face.

996
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:39,960
Now tell me, Paul,

997
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,260
Did that actually happen?

998
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,130
Yeah, it happened.

999
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:10,580
It must feel good

1000
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:14,180
To get something like
that off your chest.

1001
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,620
(sobbing)

1002
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:48,930
(heavy sobbing)

1003
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:52,150
Hey, granddad.
Have you seen my camera?

1004
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:54,320
Nope.

1005
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:57,760
Oh, there it is.

1006
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,560
Elliot: Last night
I didn't sleep as usual.

1007
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:31,860
I got to thinking,

1008
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:35,860
Maybe around, like,
4 A.M or so,

1009
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,030
That you know,
it seems like there's been

1010
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:43,670
An inordinate amount
of drama since we got here.

1011
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:45,180
And it made me think that,

1012
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:46,940
Ifwe come down here
for a funeral,

1013
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,970
Instead of a wedding,

1014
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:53,750
We might actually all
be getting along.

1015
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:56,910
Now, begs the question
what does that mean?

1016
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,480
And the only conclusion
I've been able to come to,

1017
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:05,930
Is that death is actually
a more unifying force

1018
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,730
Within family than love.

1019
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:10,860
That's a mind
blowing concept.

1020
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:15,810
It is a despicable
thing to say.

1021
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,070
Really?

1022
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:21,080
Really.

1023
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:25,880
I mean, I know this sounds
kind of cynical, but--

1024
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,120
I mean, take 9/11
for instance.

1025
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,490
I know I was young
when it happened,

1026
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,860
But honestly,
when I think about it,

1027
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:41,200
It may have been the only time
in my entire life

1028
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:45,930
That I ever really,
truly felt connected

1029
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:48,530
To every single member
of my family.

1030
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:51,700
Like some strange,
intangible nexus

1031
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,840
Just unveiled itself
for a moment.

1032
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,250
I know it's still there.

1033
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,770
That's not what I'm saying.

1034
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:02,720
I guess I just think it's
weird that it takes tragedy

1035
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:05,990
To bring it out.

1036
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:11,090
Well, l-- perhaps it's just
the way you were brought up.

1037
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:16,800
Mmm.

1038
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:21,100
I am myself
and my circumstances.

1039
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:23,440
Did you hear about Alice?

1040
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,070
Yeah. I feel bad for her.

1041
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:26,630
Supposedly, it's bad.

1042
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,980
It's such a bizarre
thing to do to yourself.

1043
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:29,670
I don't get it.

1044
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,110
Now they're gonna sew
sleeves on her dress.

1045
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:32,710
She's so gruesome.

1046
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:35,150
Lynn says it's this
generation's anorexia.

1047
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,920
Anorexia, I can understand.

1048
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,050
Everybody wants to look good,
but this is just gross.

1049
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:40,850
It is.

1050
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:42,880
You don't do it, do you?
Any of your friends do it?

1051
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:44,450
No, of course not.

1052
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:46,160
See, so it's not
generational Donna.

1053
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,470
I didn't say it,
Lynn said it.

1054
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,730
I just hope
she looks nice.

1055
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:51,170
Well, it may not matter.

1056
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,530
- Why? What do you got?
- Why? What do you mean?

1057
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:53,900
Lynn said something about

1058
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,810
Not wanting to bring Alice
into this environment.

1059
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,430
(overlapping dialogue)

1060
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,910
How could she do
such a thing, you know?

1061
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:01,540
Do what?

1062
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,380
Alice isn't coming
to the wedding!

1063
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,880
What?

1064
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,910
That is not
necessarily a given.

1065
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:09,420
She wants
everything about her

1066
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,790
Because she wants
all the attention

1067
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:11,910
Because she's just
like her mother.

1068
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,820
Who said she's not coming?

1069
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:15,160
Donna said that
Lynn said it.

1070
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:17,130
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

1071
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,530
How could she do that?
How could she just not come?

1072
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:22,930
(muffled)
I dunno.

1073
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:29,000
What?

1074
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,670
How could she do that?
How could she not come?

1075
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:34,680
How can she ruin
her brother's wedding?

1076
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:36,080
What is wrong with you?

1077
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:38,640
Who said she's
not coming, mom?

1078
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:42,480
You should just tell her
to stop all this silly drama.

1079
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,090
This isn't about her.

1080
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:47,120
It's about Heather and Dylan.
It's their day.

1081
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,530
I know that!
She is coming!

1082
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:51,460
Who said she's not coming?

1083
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,730
It doesn't matter who
said it for god's sakes, Lynn!

1084
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:55,430
It was said!

1085
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,200
You should've just told
her to call her father

1086
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,030
And to resolve
this whole thing

1087
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:00,730
Instead now
it's all ruined.

1088
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:03,800
Oh, fine.

1089
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:26,560
(background chatter)

1090
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:11,010
(chatter abruptly stops)

1091
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,510
Hey, everybody.

1092
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,020
Oh, thank god.

1093
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:25,350
What's up, Alice?

1094
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:26,950
- How are you?
- I'm good.

1095
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:29,120
Yeah? Mom.

1096
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,060
- Hi.
- How are you?

1097
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:32,890
- I'm good. I'm good.
- You look good.

1098
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:34,900
Thank you. Hi!

1099
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:36,490
I'm not waiting
to give you a hug.

1100
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:37,800
Good.

1101
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,390
Thank you so much
for being here.

1102
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,370
Hey, what's
cooking everybody?

1103
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:45,710
Let's do all the introductions
and be pseudo polite--

1104
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:48,380
For the love of granddad's
elusive god,

1105
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,410
Can we just get dinner?

1106
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:52,680
And school. How's school?
Do you have a boyfriend?

1107
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,550
I know you do. You must because
you're too freaking gorgeous.

1108
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:57,520
I suppose. It's good.

1109
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:01,010
Bonnie, it's summer now.

1110
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:02,860
Donna, can you please
pass the roast?

1111
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:04,560
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1112
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,330
- No boyfriend?
- No.

1113
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,660
There must be
someone out there.

1114
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:10,290
No, l-- I can cut it.

1115
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:11,320
I don't mind.
I don't mind.

1116
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:14,570
Donna. Donna, please stop it.

1117
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:16,370
She can eat like
everyone else.

1118
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:18,340
I bet you there's someone
waiting in the wings.

1119
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,780
Lynn (VO): I think you lost
your keys or something.

1120
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:22,440
But you were screaming at me.

1121
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,710
And Alice was holding
on to my leg.

1122
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:28,690
And she was terrified.
She wouldn't let go.

1123
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,780
And then you grabbed me
by my shirt--

1124
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:35,950
Shit, Alice.
I'm sorry.

1125
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:37,020
- It's all right.
- That was a bad id--

1126
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:39,460
I didn't think about it.

1127
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:44,660
Dude, are you, like, crying?

1128
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,730
(sobbing)

1129
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:49,930
I think Alice handled
the family very well.

1130
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,600
(muffled TV)

1131
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:55,080
Yeah, she and Dylan
were cracking up

1132
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:57,450
About that dog in the outfit.

1133
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,850
A cowboy.

1134
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:02,950
I just don't know what I'm
supposed to do about Paul.

1135
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:05,860
That's a tough one.

1136
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:11,880
I just don't get
what the appeal is.

1137
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:14,370
Of Paul?

1138
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:16,770
No, the cowboy dog.

1139
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,500
Are you even
listening to me?

1140
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:23,030
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

1141
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:25,100
I just can't
get over that dog.

1142
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:27,410
Well, try, Lee.

1143
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:35,040
He had these little holsters
and--

1144
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:38,650
Little chaps he was wearing.

1145
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:41,720
(barks)

1146
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:45,630
(both laugh)

1147
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:48,390
So I'm pretty sure
grandma's a sociopath.

1148
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:50,490
No, I'm serious.

1149
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:52,130
I think it requires
investigation.

1150
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:54,830
I think you should write
your thesis paper on this.

1151
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:58,100
Yeah, call it
"heart of darkness 4."

1152
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:01,440
Thesis papers don't
have such poetic titles.

1153
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,610
Yeah.

1154
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:09,880
What the fuck are you doing
with drugs, Elliot?

1155
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,050
You got out of your fourth
rehab three months ago.

1156
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:14,960
Alice, come on.

1157
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:16,520
Weed's not a real drug.

1158
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,590
It's like a teddy bear.

1159
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:22,000
Or a gecko.

1160
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:23,900
You're not fucking around
with anything else?

1161
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:25,870
No, of course not.

1162
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,700
Seriously, Elliot.

1163
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:30,000
You fucking scared us.

1164
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,440
I promise.

1165
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:35,780
You really wanna
open the floodgates

1166
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:37,680
On the self-destructive
behavior,

1167
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,010
Little miss mutilation?

1168
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:41,420
No, it wasn't good.
You were really fucked up.

1169
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:45,110
I know.
I get it.

1170
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,720
I'm not doing
the bad shit anymore.

1171
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:52,860
I'm just doing normal,
teenage drugs.

1172
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,900
(blows three times)

1173
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:11,420
(chuckles)

1174
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:17,350
Wow. I see tablespoons,

1175
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:20,480
Teaspoons,

1176
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:23,960
Dinner forks,

1177
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,690
Dessert forks.

1178
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:29,390
But nary a knife in sight.

1179
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:31,700
- Really?
- Yup.

1180
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:32,860
Mmm-mmm.

1181
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,400
The knives have migrated.

1182
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,810
Maybe grandma's just baby
proofing the house

1183
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:39,900
For granddad.

1184
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:41,470
Do they honestly think

1185
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:45,040
That access to a butter
knife is my problem?

1186
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:49,350
Are you fucking kidding?
Abso-fucking-lutely they do.

1187
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:53,190
Dude, granny baker's already
swapped out your lady bic

1188
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:55,890
With a bucket of nair.

1189
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:59,830
(both laugh)

1190
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,990
(distant yell)

1191
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:04,520
I need an
ambulance right away

1192
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:08,270
To number 9 Overlook
Drive, please.

1193
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:10,640
Yes.

1194
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,700
Uh-huh.

1195
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:15,540
Don't touch him.

1196
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:16,510
(yells)

1197
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:18,020
Yes, he's still breathing.

1198
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:21,710
Thank you.

1199
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:23,240
(loud groan)

1200
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:25,420
Don't worry.
This is what happens.

1201
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:40,970
Ben (VO): Are you on drugs?
Elliot (VO): What?

1202
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:43,870
Ben: Did you,
like, take something?

1203
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:46,930
Uh, yeah.

1204
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:50,540
What'd you take?

1205
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:53,550
Fentanyl.

1206
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:56,380
What's fentanyl?

1207
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,720
It's like morphine.

1208
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:01,350
81 times more potent.

1209
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:06,450
Are you, like,
afraid of dying?

1210
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:11,900
Every second.
Every day, yeah.

1211
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:20,440
Doesn't make any sense.

1212
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,210
I know.

1213
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:32,250
What's it feel like?

1214
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:35,850
(soft moan)

1215
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:54,000
(no audible dialogue)

1216
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:30,740
Oh, in case your
mother didn't tell you,

1217
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:33,440
I won't be at the
rehearsal dinner.

1218
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:37,550
I'll be at the hospital
with your grandfather.

1219
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,960
Where's Paul?

1220
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,730
Doesn't look like he's here.

1221
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:50,730
Well, like,
why isn't he here?

1222
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:54,500
How the fuck
should I know?

1223
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:55,940
I just think it's
weird, like,

1224
01:05:55,970 --> 01:05:57,840
What if he got into
a car accident or something?

1225
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,470
Ben, shut the fuck up.
You're killing me.

1226
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:02,570
Whatever.

1227
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:09,580
(background chatter)

1228
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:14,290
Where's your sister?
Where's Alice?

1229
01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:17,490
Lee, would you go
check on Alice?

1230
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:18,620
I'm-- I'm wearing heels.

1231
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:21,560
Alrighty.

1232
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,620
Why didn't you
wear a shirt?

1233
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:25,260
What do you mean?
This is a shirt.

1234
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,360
No, it isn't a shirt.
That's a sweatshirt.

1235
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:28,270
That's a shirt.

1236
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:31,630
What's the holdup?
You ready?

1237
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,740
You ready?

1238
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:41,680
What do I say to him, dad?

1239
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:45,450
Who?

1240
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:47,620
Paul, what--
you know.

1241
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:51,460
What do I say to him?

1242
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,950
What'll we talk about?

1243
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,340
Well, uh, you know l
understand it's-- it's awkward,

1244
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:04,540
But, oh, he'll
probably, uh,

1245
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:07,570
He'll probably ask you
what you've been up to

1246
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:13,280
And you'll tell him
and-- and...

1247
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,450
You'll ask him
and he'll tell you

1248
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:18,510
And go on from there.

1249
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,490
It's-- it's
a rehearsal dinner.

1250
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:22,220
It's not the
camp David accords.

1251
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:25,660
Hey, are you hot?

1252
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:27,630
Feeling good?
Absolutely.

1253
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:32,730
(background chatter)

1254
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:38,480
Hey. Good to see you, Paul.

1255
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:40,500
Lee, good to see you.

1256
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:45,740
Oh, my god.
You guys look so big.

1257
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:47,410
Wow.

1258
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:48,650
Coming in for one.

1259
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:50,350
Paul, how's it going, man?

1260
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:51,410
Hanging in there.

1261
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:53,360
Hey, how are you doing, man?

1262
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:55,760
We met briefly, exchanged--
I don't know if you remember,

1263
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:57,230
But it was powertul for me.

1264
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:59,860
Alice, if you're comfortable,

1265
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:02,760
I'm gonna take these
two virtuous maidens,

1266
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,770
I'm going to defile them,

1267
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,270
With my thoughts and opinions

1268
01:08:07,310 --> 01:08:09,330
On the current state
of organized religion

1269
01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:11,840
Which are controversial,
Paul, rest assured.

1270
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:16,310
I'm sorry, he has problems.

1271
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:19,280
Well, that's sort of evident.

1272
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:23,620
Um, so, but you do not.

1273
01:08:23,650 --> 01:08:27,220
You, uh, you're all grown up.

1274
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:28,690
It's amazing.

1275
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:31,220
Sorry I missed it.

1276
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:33,390
But, um,
thank you for coming.

1277
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:34,830
It means a lot to everybody.

1278
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:37,460
Yeah. I mean,
Charlie and Sam,

1279
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,560
I hardly recognize them.

1280
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,590
They're so grown up.

1281
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,800
They always ask about you.

1282
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,240
They're like how come Alice
doesn't live with us anymore?

1283
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:48,340
Wait, is that how
they remember it?

1284
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:49,440
Like when I come
for the summers?

1285
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,610
They don't ever
think I lived there.

1286
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:52,510
No, no, no, no.

1287
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:54,810
- Why would they think that?
- It's not anything specific.

1288
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:57,320
It's, uh, just more of a--

1289
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:00,550
They were the little kids
and you were the big sister

1290
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:05,320
And it's in the past and
that's where it should stay.

1291
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:09,770
Um, and hopefully, everything's
forgiven, you know?

1292
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:13,640
What, uh-- the degree?

1293
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:17,730
What, uh, is that
something interesting?

1294
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:20,870
Yeah. It is interesting.

1295
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:23,110
It's, um, child development.

1296
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:25,120
- Uh-huh.
- Mmm-hmm.

1297
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:28,350
So that means that you
would be a-- a--

1298
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:32,250
Take care of babies,
pediatrician or--?

1299
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:35,520
No, child development
is more psychology.

1300
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:36,550
Psychology.

1301
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,190
Yeah, of course.

1302
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:41,290
Must've gotten that
from your mother.

1303
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:42,660
Got what?

1304
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:47,140
You know, the thing.
With Lynn.

1305
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:50,800
The therapist.
You know. Everything.

1306
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:54,330
That wasn't just her.

1307
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:59,320
O'grady: Is everyone here now?

1308
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:03,220
Okay. You wanna head in?

1309
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:04,850
O'grady: That's right.
And right down here.

1310
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:06,650
That's excellent guys.

1311
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:09,720
Now we're just going to split
off, okay perfect, thank you.

1312
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,730
And right this way, sweetie.
Right over here.

1313
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:17,760
That was great.
That was excellent.

1314
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:22,740
And now if we could have the
groom walk his mom to her seat.

1315
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:28,840
Okay, um--

1316
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,710
It, uh-- I just--

1317
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:34,380
Dylan, didn't you tell her?

1318
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:36,320
Tell me what, Lynn?

1319
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,650
Uh--

1320
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:44,350
I mean do you think that you can
just waltz right back into his--

1321
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,730
- Well--
- life?

1322
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,730
Did she push you
to do this to me?

1323
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:50,200
No, no. No.

1324
01:10:50,230 --> 01:10:53,400
No, it's just that--

1325
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:59,370
She's my mother, Patty.

1326
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:07,770
And--

1327
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:13,150
Weren't you the
one who said

1328
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:16,720
That parenting entails

1329
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:20,730
Certain responsibilities,
right?

1330
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:24,330
Well, I'm the one
that drove him to school.

1331
01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:25,700
I'm the one that put him to bed.

1332
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,230
I'm the one who tickled his back

1333
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:30,210
When he was afraid
and had a nightmare.

1334
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,440
I'm the one who
washed his clothes.

1335
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:36,240
Not you.
Not you!

1336
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:39,650
I was the one who was
always there, not you.

1337
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:44,450
Patty, why don't we
get a breath of air.

1338
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:46,180
We are outside, Paul!

1339
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,660
Fine. Back off.

1340
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:50,720
Just calm down.

1341
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:55,790
I'm-- I'm sorr--
sorry.

1342
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:58,270
I'm telling you, Lee,
now she's really gonna be

1343
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:59,770
On the fucking warpath.

1344
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,770
The fucking warpath.

1345
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,710
How you doing back there,
Elliot?

1346
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:10,340
I'm contemplating
the symbolic nature

1347
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:13,370
Of this seating arrangement.

1348
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:15,250
(rapping, beat boxing)

1349
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:17,850
here come the Hellmans
no sense of equilibrium

1350
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:20,450
the family members catalyst
like yellow cake and tritium

1351
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:23,120
from a fight we'll blow
our way to center stage

1352
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,560
this is rage, this is rage,
this is a crew with some rage

1353
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,360
Iet's slay the beast to save
the feast, animals in a cage

1354
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,260
get 'em, no cops
on this green earth

1355
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:32,290
going to keep us from rising
we fuck up genes, these rings

1356
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:34,070
and all the things
we brutalizing

1357
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:36,570
not one yuppie on this family
will be my own relation

1358
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:38,070
right hand up I go seven

1359
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:40,200
sieg heils
at Hellman nation?

1360
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,730
Oh, shit, Elliot!

1361
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:45,320
Coming all the way from MIC
straight to Annapolis

1362
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,810
Just to fucking kill it!

1363
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:47,720
In one, my goodness.

1364
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:50,720
Oh, my goodness, bitches.

1365
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:55,390
Oh my god, making my baby
batter boil, boy. Woo.

1366
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:56,860
They're like 6.5s.

1367
01:12:56,890 --> 01:12:58,590
Oh, my god.
Look at that one.

1368
01:12:58,630 --> 01:13:01,190
Look at that one, she's a
motherfucking thoroughbred!

1369
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:03,200
Oh, she's all
classy and shit.

1370
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:05,570
I bet she's got black,
satin sheets.

1371
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,800
Mmm, little runway strip
to park my plane in that.

1372
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,330
Mmm! Get my dick wet tonight.

1373
01:13:10,370 --> 01:13:11,770
I'd tap that.

1374
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:14,400
Boy, you don't even know
shit about tapping shit.

1375
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:16,640
Yeah, I do. I found this
book on my mom's bed

1376
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,480
All about the g-spot.

1377
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,380
I've been trying it out
on a few bitches.

1378
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:22,110
(overlapping dialogue)

1379
01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:24,140
You know how I can
be totally certain

1380
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:25,550
That you're full
of shit right now?

1381
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:27,180
I'm not, but how?

1382
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:30,590
Because if your mom really
knew where her g-spot was,

1383
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:33,230
She wouldn't have to make
costumes for dogs.

1384
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:35,790
Oh! Snap, nigga!

1385
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:38,200
- Seriously, you understand?
- What're you guys laughing at?

1386
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,400
- Baby batter.
- Shut the fuck up, Ben.

1387
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:44,100
Hey, Elliot, better dance
with me tomorrow night.

1388
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:49,140
Um, dancing isn't
particularly my thing.

1389
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,510
Wait, that's not true.
You can do the macarena.

1390
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:53,520
Really, Elliot?

1391
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:55,350
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, Ben.

1392
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:57,250
Yeah, I do. 'cause mom taught
you and you taught me.

1393
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:02,260
You were good.
Remember?

1394
01:14:02,290 --> 01:14:05,230
You guys know about
my brother Ben, right?

1395
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:07,360
You know how he
has severe autism?

1396
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,160
(laughter)

1397
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,400
You don't wanna talk
about it too much,

1398
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:15,390
Because if you talk about severe
autism to the retard too much,

1399
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,700
Then he gets low self-esteem,
and that's not good.

1400
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:19,300
Right, Ben?

1401
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:20,740
Isn't that right?

1402
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:26,210
Samantha, care for a smoke?

1403
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:28,580
You don't?

1404
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:29,980
It would make you look
so much more attractive.

1405
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:32,180
(knocking)

1406
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:35,020
Oh, my god, she is
such a fucking bitch.

1407
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:39,590
Better to be pale.
It's better to--

1408
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:41,360
(sighs)

1409
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,660
- Is he all right?
- He's fine.

1410
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:46,360
I'll tell you, you
can't find a better beer

1411
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,740
Than this michelob ultra.

1412
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:53,640
It's almost zero carbs.
How 'bout that?

1413
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:54,770
Interesting.

1414
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:57,980
(muted dialogue)

1415
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:19,070
Is he all right?

1416
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:21,070
He's fine.

1417
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:23,300
We have them made
for us in Indiana.

1418
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:25,640
- And really, the money is--
- right.

1419
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:28,240
Now the deal with GM,
was for carriages?

1420
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:31,020
- They don't look the same.
- Cubic zirconias look the same.

1421
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:32,850
I know, but I'm talking--

1422
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,540
It's just a status thing.
I just don't get that.

1423
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:36,490
It's interesting,

1424
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:40,320
Most people think that when
rock 'n' roll first hit--

1425
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,690
Boom-- that there
was nothing else.

1426
01:15:42,730 --> 01:15:47,160
Not true, because what most
people don't remember

1427
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:51,000
Was that there was
this strange time,

1428
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,660
Maybe three or four years,

1429
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:56,660
When everything sort of
coincided so that you had--

1430
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:59,610
You had your perry comos
and your bill haleys

1431
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,200
And your pat boones.

1432
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:05,180
And you had people
like Jill Corey.

1433
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:06,210
You remember?

1434
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:07,950
No.

1435
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:09,680
Yeah, you do, because
I played you that song.

1436
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,350
"make like a bunny honey".

1437
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:13,980
I'm gonna go call granny
and check on everybody.

1438
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:15,420
See how they are
at the hospital.

1439
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:17,690
Good. Tell them we're
praying for them.

1440
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:24,600
- Hey.
- Hey.

1441
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,700
Look, um,
I just want to say l--

1442
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:31,570
I think we got off on the wrong
foot back at the house.

1443
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:35,570
And-- and all I really
wanted to convey to you

1444
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:38,170
Was that-- that I really
have missed you.

1445
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:40,950
That we, all,
have missed you.

1446
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:43,220
Your mother said that you
weren't feeling good

1447
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:45,950
And so I just didn't
know what to expect.

1448
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:47,650
Well, after
everything you heard,

1449
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:49,280
I hope I didn't
disappoint you.

1450
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:50,420
Disappoint me?

1451
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:53,730
No, no way, no. No.

1452
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,490
What does that mean?

1453
01:16:55,530 --> 01:16:58,300
Sorry, I'm just being
kind of awkward.

1454
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:02,140
Um--
(clears throat)

1455
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:04,610
Dylan told me that you
gave him a big promotion.

1456
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,670
That's-- yeah,
that's really great.

1457
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:08,470
- He deserves it.
- Yeah.

1458
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:11,540
Done a great job, but he's
gotta build towards something,

1459
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:12,510
Like you're doing.

1460
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:14,380
Yeah, thanks.

1461
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:17,220
I mean, I had to take
some time off, but, um,

1462
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:19,350
I'm doubling up on courses
for September

1463
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:20,580
So I can graduate on time.

1464
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:22,260
- That's good.
- Yeah.

1465
01:17:22,290 --> 01:17:25,130
I'm-- I'm so happy you
finally found something.

1466
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:29,330
I mean, I really love it.
You know. I--

1467
01:17:29,370 --> 01:17:31,630
I don't know,
I feel like maybe

1468
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:35,300
I have something to
offer there in a way.

1469
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:39,500
Alice, I know everybody thinks

1470
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:44,950
That I don't understand
everything.

1471
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:47,180
And maybe they're right.

1472
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:51,350
But I want to.
I do.

1473
01:17:51,390 --> 01:17:53,380
Thanks, Paul.

1474
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:56,520
And you know, if you ever
want to just phone me,

1475
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,090
Or just wanna talk,

1476
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:01,150
Maybe you're feeling
down or something,

1477
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:04,130
I just don't want to
lose touch with you again.

1478
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:06,330
If that's what you want.

1479
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:13,340
Yeah, I mean, l'd--
I'd really like that.

1480
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:19,280
Maybe we could, um,

1481
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:23,310
Get lunch or something.

1482
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:39,870
I mean, um, maybe it could--

1483
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:45,170
Maybe it could
just be me and you.

1484
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:01,350
She's my wife.

1485
01:19:01,390 --> 01:19:03,920
Alice--

1486
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:12,900
I know.

1487
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:25,980
Uh, excuse me, barkeep.

1488
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:27,350
Yeah?

1489
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:30,620
Um, can I get three shots--
double shots

1490
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:32,620
Of your finest
whiskey, please?

1491
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:36,090
Um, how old are you?

1492
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:38,220
Okay, I'm 17,

1493
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:40,960
This is my family
and this is hell.

1494
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,300
I beg you.
Have some fucking sympathy.

1495
01:19:44,330 --> 01:19:45,930
I call it my Thursday list.

1496
01:19:45,970 --> 01:19:47,490
Alice is hysterical
in the parking lot.

1497
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:48,600
Give me my purse.

1498
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,570
Grab the kids.
I need to pee.

1499
01:19:50,610 --> 01:19:53,440
Alrighty.

1500
01:19:54,910 --> 01:19:57,440
Um, do you, like,
drink often?

1501
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:59,850
Only really
when I'm on opiates.

1502
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:02,010
Okay.

1503
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:05,320
But, like,
what I was, like, saying,

1504
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:10,320
Is that, like, my mother
really is the one who, like,

1505
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:13,450
Raised Dylan,
not your mother.

1506
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:18,160
And, like, I don't mean that in,
like, an offensive way,

1507
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,170
It's just, like, the truth.

1508
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:23,070
And, like, I guess,
like what I want to say

1509
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:27,870
Is that, like, I think it's,
like, pretty disrespectful

1510
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:31,940
That, like, your mother
forced Dylan to choose her

1511
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:34,210
To walking down the aisle.

1512
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:36,340
Mmm.

1513
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:39,650
So, yeah.

1514
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:48,520
You wanna know
something hilarious?

1515
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:50,290
Sure.

1516
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:51,490
You sure?

1517
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:15,930
(urinating)

1518
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:26,260
(door opens, footsteps)

1519
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,710
Sounds like
you're finished.

1520
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:39,150
What?

1521
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:41,170
Sounds like
you're finished.

1522
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,480
Wait, what?

1523
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,710
Come on out, Lynn.

1524
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:45,050
Why?

1525
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:48,390
Come out of the stall, Lynn.

1526
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:49,410
Okay, but, um--

1527
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:51,430
Oh, my god.
There you are.

1528
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:53,360
I've been, like, looking,
like, all over for you.

1529
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,370
You will never,
ever, ever believe

1530
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,590
What Elliot just said to me.

1531
01:21:56,630 --> 01:21:59,120
He's, like, so arrogant,
and also

1532
01:21:59,170 --> 01:22:01,070
A complete,
drunk drug addict.

1533
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:04,160
He ordered, like, three double
shots of, like, whatever,

1534
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:06,370
And I was like, um,
do you drink often?

1535
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:09,000
And he was like,
I like to mix it with opiates.

1536
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:10,170
So gross.

1537
01:22:10,210 --> 01:22:11,510
- They're disgusting.
- So gross.

1538
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:13,210
The whole family's
disgusting.

1539
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:16,050
I know. They're disgusting.
I hate them.

1540
01:22:16,090 --> 01:22:17,920
Who was that?

1541
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,550
Like, didn't even
wash her hands.

1542
01:22:19,590 --> 01:22:21,250
Good god, Paul.

1543
01:22:21,290 --> 01:22:23,450
Can't you keep
that fucking pit bull

1544
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:24,930
Of your wife under control?

1545
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:29,190
Elliot says that Lynn says
that when dad met you,

1546
01:22:29,230 --> 01:22:31,600
You were a stripper.

1547
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:35,000
And a coke whore.

1548
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,370
- Mmm.
- Is that true?

1549
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:40,210
- Really.
- Is that true?

1550
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:42,240
Baby, it's ridiculous.

1551
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:44,440
Mom, now you promise me
that's not true.

1552
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,970
- That piece of shit!
- You lying whore.

1553
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:48,210
What? What?

1554
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:50,120
Have you been telling
your kids

1555
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:51,810
That I was a stripper
and a coke whore?

1556
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:53,910
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

1557
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:56,020
- I didn't say that!
- Lynn, did you say that?

1558
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:58,560
- No, of course not!
- That's what Elliot told me!

1559
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,390
Fuck him!
He's a fucking asshole!

1560
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:01,950
Oh, what a good
mother you are.

1561
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,930
You're such a good mother.
So sweet.

1562
01:23:03,970 --> 01:23:06,230
Elliot has Tourette's syndrome!
He'll say anything!

1563
01:23:06,270 --> 01:23:08,030
He has no filter!

1564
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:10,070
Meanwhile you come
waltzing into this family

1565
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:11,800
And you try to
rip us fucking apart!

1566
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:15,370
I tried to rip your family
apart? Are you joking me?

1567
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:18,070
I raised Dylan. I'm not
the one who abandoned him.

1568
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:26,480
You could go fuck yourself!
You fucking redneck--

1569
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:29,980
(all yelling)

1570
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:33,590
Paul: Let go of her!

1571
01:23:33,630 --> 01:23:38,190
Goddamnit, let go of her!

1572
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,290
You found someone to
fight back, didn't you?

1573
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:42,360
You're goddamn right,
I'll fucking tear you apart!

1574
01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:44,240
She's gone!

1575
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:55,180
(overlapping dialogue)

1576
01:23:56,890 --> 01:23:59,880
Get out. Get out.
You son of a bitch.

1577
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,250
Think you just insulted
yourself, mom.

1578
01:24:01,290 --> 01:24:03,490
Shut up and go
fuck yourself!

1579
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:05,090
- What did I do?
- Go fuck yourself.

1580
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:06,790
The hell is going on?

1581
01:24:06,830 --> 01:24:08,350
She grabbed me.
She grabbed me.

1582
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:11,390
And she--
she strangled me.

1583
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,100
- What? Who?
- Patty!

1584
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:14,230
Patty assaulted me, Lee.

1585
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:16,070
- Really?
- Really?

1586
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:18,270
- And this motherfucker--
- okay, that's weird, mom.

1587
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:20,800
This motherfucker has been
drinking and doing drugs.

1588
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,370
Calm down, calm down.

1589
01:24:22,410 --> 01:24:25,380
I had a few, I had anxiety,
I had a fucking panic attack.

1590
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:27,140
Let's just get in the car.
Get in the car.

1591
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:28,910
Shut up!

1592
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:30,420
In the car.

1593
01:24:30,450 --> 01:24:32,450
- She's pissed.
- Oh, she's pissed, Ben?

1594
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:34,480
Thank you for telling
me that she's pissed.

1595
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:36,990
Otherwise I would
have no idea, Ben.

1596
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:39,290
(both sobbing)

1597
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:42,360
- Door is locked.
- Oh, this fucking thing.

1598
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,260
(beeping)

1599
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:45,890
Lee, open the door.

1600
01:24:45,970 --> 01:24:49,000
Lee: Goddamnit.

1601
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,130
Now why the hell they
can't make these things

1602
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:52,440
A little bit simpler?

1603
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,810
It's 12:13 ante meridian,

1604
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:56,440
And I'm reporting to you
live and on the scene

1605
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,510
Outside the home
of Joe and Doris baker

1606
01:24:58,550 --> 01:25:00,070
In the heart of
queen anne city,

1607
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,380
Annapolis, Maryland,

1608
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:03,390
Where just moments ago

1609
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:06,880
The diabolical force,
known as the Hellman family,

1610
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:09,410
Has finally submerged this
quaint, waterfront town

1611
01:25:09,490 --> 01:25:12,260
Into complete and utter chaos.

1612
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:15,460
With their overly sensitive
self-destructive daughter,

1613
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:17,360
Alice scissorhands,

1614
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,460
And the rather unseemly
and highly inappropriate

1615
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,130
Behavior of their mama familias,

1616
01:25:21,170 --> 01:25:23,200
Some have begun to wonder,

1617
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:26,040
How will tomorrow's
events unfold?

1618
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:30,840
Oh, wait, one moment.

1619
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,150
I'm getting something.

1620
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:35,810
Preliminary reports
are suggesting

1621
01:25:35,850 --> 01:25:39,480
That no matter the outcome,
Doris baker is

1622
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:43,930
And will remain
quietly furious.

1623
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:47,090
The question that begs to be
answered however, is,

1624
01:25:47,130 --> 01:25:51,160
Will they unite
for just one day?

1625
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:55,070
Or will all hell break loose and
split this family in two

1626
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:57,340
Like a Maryland blue crab?

1627
01:25:57,370 --> 01:26:00,340
(Ben & Elliot laugh)

1628
01:26:02,910 --> 01:26:07,320
This is Elliot Hellman reporting
to you live for fuck news.

1629
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:08,750
Back over to you, Ben.

1630
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:18,320
What's the name
of that tea I like?

1631
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:22,270
Which one?

1632
01:26:22,270 --> 01:26:24,320
The one I drink.

1633
01:26:24,370 --> 01:26:25,830
Green tea.

1634
01:26:25,870 --> 01:26:27,300
No, no, it's chamomile.

1635
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:29,430
So why are you asking me?

1636
01:26:29,470 --> 01:26:31,700
I'm asking what it's name is.

1637
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:36,470
Surrender. Surrender.

1638
01:26:36,510 --> 01:26:41,970
Yeah. Surrender to sleep.

1639
01:26:45,390 --> 01:26:49,920
Jesus Christ, Lee.

1640
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,090
Why don't you just
ask for it?

1641
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,930
Doris: No, no.
Never turn that light on.

1642
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:20,690
Mom, can I talk to you
for a minute?

1643
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:23,120
No, Lynn, you can't.

1644
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:27,790
Why is it you have never learned
when to just keep quiet?

1645
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:29,860
I just wanted--

1646
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:33,340
I know what you want.
We all know what you want, Lynn.

1647
01:27:33,370 --> 01:27:35,030
'cause you never
had the decency

1648
01:27:35,070 --> 01:27:36,970
Or the respect or the
consideration

1649
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:39,270
To keep anything private.

1650
01:27:39,310 --> 01:27:42,280
I'm just trying
to make things better.

1651
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:45,750
Yeah, yeah.
For who, Lynn? For me?

1652
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:48,340
Huh? Sitting here in
the middle of the night

1653
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:51,080
And I can't sleep.

1654
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:55,150
I'm totally exhausted
and I can't get to sleep.

1655
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:56,990
You're gonna make
things better for me?

1656
01:27:59,830 --> 01:28:02,300
The doctor said he's stable.

1657
01:28:02,330 --> 01:28:05,100
They can't do anything
else for him.

1658
01:28:07,870 --> 01:28:10,860
Just keep him comfortable.

1659
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:13,710
It's all--

1660
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:17,410
It's all I've done
my whole life,

1661
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:19,780
Kept him comfortable.

1662
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:32,750
I was seventeen years old
when I met your father.

1663
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:35,290
He was so handsome.

1664
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:39,700
So tall

1665
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:44,900
And strong and shy.

1666
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:50,670
I miss him.

1667
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:55,250
I miss the man I married.

1668
01:28:55,290 --> 01:28:57,080
I miss him when he's here

1669
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:58,680
And I miss him
when he's not here.

1670
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:03,180
Tonight I was lying
in bed and I thought

1671
01:29:03,230 --> 01:29:06,020
When did this happen?

1672
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:08,900
When did he disappear?

1673
01:29:10,870 --> 01:29:14,740
When did I first fall asleep

1674
01:29:14,770 --> 01:29:17,900
In an empty bed?

1675
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:20,140
In an empty house?

1676
01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:28,350
What did I do to deserve this?

1677
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:31,350
(sobbing)

1678
01:29:31,390 --> 01:29:34,320
What did I ever do
that was so bad?

1679
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:37,660
(sobbing)

1680
01:29:37,690 --> 01:29:40,190
And I know it's coming.
I know.

1681
01:29:42,770 --> 01:29:47,760
Every time I wake up, before
I open my eyes and listen,

1682
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:52,710
Hear if he's still breathing.

1683
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:57,940
I don't know what
I'm going to do...

1684
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:04,820
...When I wake up and he's not.

1685
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:09,790
When there's nothing
but the silence.

1686
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:13,060
Just silence.

1687
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:14,430
What am I going to do, Lynn?

1688
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:18,370
(crying)

1689
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,770
Okay, okay, okay.

1690
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:24,400
(laughs)
so?

1691
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:28,970
There it goes, huh?
There it goes, Lynn.

1692
01:30:29,010 --> 01:30:31,980
You got me.
(laughs)

1693
01:30:32,020 --> 01:30:34,680
That's what you came
down here for, isn't it?

1694
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:47,930
("Malaguena" plays)

1695
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:11,040
(no audible dialogue)

1696
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:36,110
(no audible dialogue)

1697
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:19,960
(no audible dialogue)

1698
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:31,290
("Malaguena" ends)

1699
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:35,740
I wasn't ready.

1700
01:32:35,770 --> 01:32:38,800
I'm still not ready.

1701
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:42,680
Things don't change, mom.

1702
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:48,570
People don't change.

1703
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:55,180
They don't matter.

1704
01:32:55,230 --> 01:33:00,030
You do, Alice.
You do.

1705
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:03,790
Lynn: And you can't let them
tell you who you are

1706
01:33:03,830 --> 01:33:05,270
Or what you're capable of,

1707
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:08,610
Because if you do,
then they win.

1708
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:10,610
I'm not like you, mom.
I'm not.

1709
01:33:10,610 --> 01:33:13,010
I wish-- I can't just
block it all out.

1710
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,880
Don't do this, Alice.

1711
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:19,810
Don't let them control the way
you feel about yourself.

1712
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:23,650
I can't help it.
I can't.

1713
01:33:23,690 --> 01:33:26,090
You're your own person.

1714
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:28,180
And you're strong.

1715
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:31,750
You're so goddamn
strong, Alice.

1716
01:33:31,790 --> 01:33:34,700
And when it was
just you and me,

1717
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:39,900
And we didn't have a fucking
soul on our side,

1718
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:43,100
I looked to you.

1719
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:45,700
I always looked to you.

1720
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:23,080
Elliot: You know,
if you don't mind, ladies,

1721
01:34:23,110 --> 01:34:24,600
I would just like to say how

1722
01:34:24,650 --> 01:34:26,740
Unbelievably gorgeous
you two look today.

1723
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:29,720
Just tremendous, you know?
Stunning. Marvelous.

1724
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:31,120
You know what, Elliot,
I would appreciate it

1725
01:34:31,150 --> 01:34:33,560
If you did not speak
for the next 24 hours.

1726
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:35,020
Why?

1727
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:36,790
'cause mom caught you
doing drugs and shit.

1728
01:34:36,830 --> 01:34:38,890
And, like, it's your
fault Patty went nuts.

1729
01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:40,830
Oh, I mean, yeah.
That's true.

1730
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:42,560
But I thought maybe we
could've moved on from that.

1731
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:44,190
You know, as a family.

1732
01:34:44,230 --> 01:34:46,700
I just don't have the energy
to move on from that.

1733
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:49,800
As a family.

1734
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:52,270
- Oooh, shit.
- Oooh, shit is right.

1735
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:54,070
What, you too?
No understanding.

1736
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:55,970
What's the matter, dad?
You never got drunk or stoned

1737
01:34:56,010 --> 01:34:57,140
When you were my age?

1738
01:34:57,180 --> 01:34:58,550
Not with the frequency

1739
01:34:58,550 --> 01:35:00,680
And degree of enthusiasm
that you do now.

1740
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:04,920
You, mom? You never skin popped
a little "d" back in the '70s?

1741
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:06,550
You know what, Elliot,
do me a favor.

1742
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:09,560
Just go ahead.
Go, go, go get high.

1743
01:35:09,630 --> 01:35:12,190
Go O.D.
Ruin your fucking life.

1744
01:35:12,230 --> 01:35:14,890
Because I'm giving up.
I'm just giving up.

1745
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:16,920
Really? That is awesome!
Wait, really?

1746
01:35:16,970 --> 01:35:18,700
Let's not get into
this right now.

1747
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:20,030
Can l? 'cause that
would be great.

1748
01:35:20,070 --> 01:35:21,870
- Elliot!
- What?

1749
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:24,930
Why do you have to be
such a fucking dick?

1750
01:35:24,970 --> 01:35:27,030
What are you so pissy about?

1751
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:29,170
Your chamber maiden dress?

1752
01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:32,310
See?

1753
01:35:32,350 --> 01:35:34,950
You're just so immature,
you know?

1754
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:37,180
When are you gonna
grow the fuck up?

1755
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:40,620
You know,
sometime near the end.

1756
01:35:51,470 --> 01:35:53,160
(background chatter)

1757
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:55,970
Bonnie: Oh, there's me!
(laughter)

1758
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:07,740
(background chatter)

1759
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:10,510
(light applause)

1760
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:19,560
And so he sees a road sign
with a trumpet exed out on it

1761
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,030
And he says to me, dad,

1762
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:25,470
How come people aren't allowed
to play the trumpet here?

1763
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:27,470
I said, aw, Dylan,

1764
01:36:27,570 --> 01:36:29,940
It means you're not allowed
to honk your car horn.

1765
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:31,740
(laughter)

1766
01:36:31,770 --> 01:36:35,510
But I just wanna raise
a toast to Dylan

1767
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:37,210
And his lovely bride, Heather.

1768
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:40,910
I know they're gonna have a long
and wonderful life together.

1769
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:45,650
I also wanna take a moment to
thank Patty, my lovely bride,

1770
01:36:45,690 --> 01:36:48,680
For putting together the
reception and the tent,

1771
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,560
And such a lovely slide show

1772
01:36:50,590 --> 01:36:52,960
That so wonderfully
captured our family.

1773
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,360
And last before I sit down,

1774
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:58,090
I just wanted to say
thank you to Alice

1775
01:36:58,130 --> 01:37:00,900
For coming home on such
a joyous occasion.

1776
01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:03,000
I know it means
a lot to her brother.

1777
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:04,840
And it means a lot
to the whole family.

1778
01:37:04,870 --> 01:37:07,900
So, thank you, Alice.

1779
01:37:10,050 --> 01:37:11,570
(scattered applause)

1780
01:37:11,610 --> 01:37:15,610
...And I always loved
Marilyn Monroe, obviously.

1781
01:37:15,650 --> 01:37:17,550
(laughter)

1782
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:21,820
So I said, now when you get up
to bat, you remember,

1783
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:25,490
I'm Marilyn Monroe,
and you're Joe DiMaggio.

1784
01:37:25,530 --> 01:37:28,620
So you look over at me

1785
01:37:28,660 --> 01:37:31,660
And I'm gonna blow
you a little kiss.

1786
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:35,070
And you are gonna hit it
right out of the park.

1787
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:38,840
And you know what?
He did.

1788
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:41,970
Okay, let's say
most of the time.

1789
01:37:42,010 --> 01:37:45,910
But did you notice today,

1790
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:48,580
When you stepped up to bat,

1791
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:51,450
I blew you a little kiss.

1792
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:56,490
Anyways, I love you, Dylan.

1793
01:37:56,530 --> 01:37:58,900
And I am so happy

1794
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:02,460
That you hit another
homer with Heather.

1795
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:06,430
And I know in my
heart of hearts,

1796
01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:10,600
That you two are a match
made in heaven.

1797
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:12,570
I love you.

1798
01:38:12,610 --> 01:38:15,670
(mouths)
I love you.

1799
01:38:15,710 --> 01:38:17,650
(light applause)

1800
01:38:20,380 --> 01:38:23,120
Lynn? Lynn.

1801
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:27,150
Would you like to come up
and share any stories

1802
01:38:27,190 --> 01:38:29,620
Of Dylan when he was
a little boy?

1803
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:38,160
Come on, give her
a little encouragement.

1804
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:40,230
(applause)

1805
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:06,160
Um, I'm Dylan's mother, Lynn.

1806
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:10,760
And, uh, I'm not very good
at this kind of thing.

1807
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:15,960
I-- I don't really have
any stories right now.

1808
01:39:16,010 --> 01:39:19,700
I didn't expect to speak.

1809
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:24,680
So, I guess, l--

1810
01:39:24,710 --> 01:39:30,180
I guess I just wanna say
how grateful I am to--

1811
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:34,920
To be a part of this
moment in your life.

1812
01:39:34,990 --> 01:39:38,690
And how happy I am
for the both of you.

1813
01:39:38,730 --> 01:39:41,390
I am.

1814
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:47,440
And I'm sorry I don't
have any funny stories

1815
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,870
From when you were
a little boy.

1816
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:56,010
I just know that l--

1817
01:39:56,050 --> 01:40:00,410
I just know that I love
you so much right now.

1818
01:40:00,450 --> 01:40:03,980
I love you so much, Dylan.

1819
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:09,050
You've grown into
such an amazing man.

1820
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:12,430
And when I look at you now,

1821
01:40:12,430 --> 01:40:15,860
I'm so proud of you.

1822
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:19,490
I'm so proud of the
man you've become.

1823
01:40:21,970 --> 01:40:23,530
That's all.

1824
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:34,650
(piano ballad plays)

1825
01:40:50,130 --> 01:40:53,070
(piano ballad continues)

1826
01:41:38,010 --> 01:41:41,070
(no audible dialogue)

1827
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:43,970
Hey, Lee.

1828
01:42:44,010 --> 01:42:45,070
Hey.

1829
01:42:45,110 --> 01:42:46,580
You know,

1830
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:51,450
You never get a band
at these things anymore.

1831
01:42:51,490 --> 01:42:55,550
God, we had
a fantastic band.

1832
01:43:00,830 --> 01:43:03,460
You know, Ben, I think my
youngest daughter

1833
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,870
Has a little crush on you.

1834
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:08,770
(light chuckle)

1835
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:12,070
Alice, do you think, uh,
maybe you and I could

1836
01:43:12,110 --> 01:43:13,770
Have a word in private?

1837
01:43:13,810 --> 01:43:14,900
Just--

1838
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:17,710
I'd rather not, Paul.

1839
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:20,740
Just for a second.
I was just--

1840
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:22,840
No.

1841
01:43:22,890 --> 01:43:24,410
It won't take long.

1842
01:43:24,450 --> 01:43:29,910
Paul, no.

1843
01:43:31,460 --> 01:43:36,520
(laughs)
okay. Read you loud and clear.

1844
01:43:36,570 --> 01:43:39,900
Just like when you
were a little girl.

1845
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:42,600
Message received. Okay.

1846
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:45,070
Lee, it's good seeing you.

1847
01:43:47,810 --> 01:43:52,650
Ben: That was, like, the most
bad ass thing I've ever seen.

1848
01:44:02,730 --> 01:44:05,660
(crickets chirp)

1849
01:44:14,940 --> 01:44:18,300
Mom, can I talk to you
for a minute?

1850
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:21,670
Excuse me.

1851
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:31,980
Mom, don't you have
anything to say to me?

1852
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:33,780
What do you want me to say?

1853
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:38,690
I wanna know why
you weren't on my side.

1854
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:43,090
You're my mother.

1855
01:44:43,130 --> 01:44:46,570
Why didn't you help me
fight for my children?

1856
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:49,440
Why couldn't you help me
fight for Dylan?

1857
01:44:49,470 --> 01:44:51,460
Christ's sakes, Lynn.

1858
01:44:51,510 --> 01:44:55,410
It's Dylan's wedding.
Can't you just let it be?

1859
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:57,570
Um, have you
guys seen Elliot?

1860
01:44:57,610 --> 01:44:59,840
Because, no one knows
where he went.

1861
01:45:04,750 --> 01:45:06,980
How you doing, grampa?

1862
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:08,850
I'm doing okay.

1863
01:45:08,890 --> 01:45:11,830
But I gotta get out there
and do some yard work.

1864
01:45:11,860 --> 01:45:14,300
Yeah, I feel you.

1865
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:15,820
Try to plow some of these
bridesmaids

1866
01:45:15,860 --> 01:45:17,460
If that's what you're
talking about.

1867
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:20,760
That isn't what
I'm talking about.

1868
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:32,610
Elliot!
Elliot?

1869
01:45:48,630 --> 01:45:53,030
(no audible dialogue)

1870
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:57,810
Elliot!

1871
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:01,970
Now, we gotta watch out
what we're doing.

1872
01:46:02,010 --> 01:46:04,910
It's dark out here.

1873
01:46:04,950 --> 01:46:08,680
Okay. Here we go.

1874
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:17,860
(no audible dialogue)

1875
01:46:27,970 --> 01:46:31,370
So he has nothing to lose.

1876
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:33,900
And he breaks up
with his fiance?

1877
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:36,910
Lee. Lee?
I don't know what to do.

1878
01:46:36,950 --> 01:46:40,400
It's very late and I don't
know where Elliot is.

1879
01:46:40,450 --> 01:46:42,470
And I'm getting scared.

1880
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:45,890
Well, where could he be?

1881
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:49,980
Dj: His name is Elliot Hellman,
about six one, six two--

1882
01:46:50,030 --> 01:46:51,960
Okay, we're off.

1883
01:46:51,990 --> 01:46:54,930
(riding mower starts)

1884
01:47:02,740 --> 01:47:04,900
Hey, uh, aunt Lynn?

1885
01:47:04,940 --> 01:47:06,570
What?

1886
01:47:06,610 --> 01:47:09,410
I don't know if I saw Elliot
for sure, for sure,

1887
01:47:09,450 --> 01:47:12,900
But I think I saw him
in an inner tube.

1888
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:15,440
Inner tube?

1889
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:19,390
Yeah. Like, uh,
in the chesapeake.

1890
01:47:19,420 --> 01:47:21,690
Oh, god.

1891
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:23,250
What?

1892
01:47:23,330 --> 01:47:25,990
Is this the harbor master?

1893
01:47:26,030 --> 01:47:31,470
Okay, I think my wife's sister's
kid is out in the bay.

1894
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:33,830
I think he's in an inner tube.

1895
01:47:38,670 --> 01:47:42,340
(no audible dialogue)

1896
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:46,580
(mouths)
the fuck is that?

1897
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:50,950
(all yelling)

1898
01:48:08,870 --> 01:48:11,240
(loud crash, horn honks)

1899
01:48:17,310 --> 01:48:20,250
(helicopter whirrs)

1900
01:48:46,810 --> 01:48:49,680
(slow piano ballad)

1901
01:48:49,710 --> 01:48:51,270
everything must change

1902
01:48:58,950 --> 01:49:01,680
nothing remains the same

1903
01:49:10,370 --> 01:49:12,420
everyone must change

1904
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:22,640
no one and nothing
remains the same

1905
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:33,450
now the young's the old

1906
01:49:39,260 --> 01:49:43,890
and mysteries do unfold

1907
01:49:48,970 --> 01:49:51,500
cause that's the way of time

1908
01:49:59,350 --> 01:50:03,480
nothing and no one
remains the same

1909
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:13,460
there are not so

1910
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,760
many things in life

1911
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:22,890
you can be sure of

1912
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:28,310
whoo

1913
01:50:29,710 --> 01:50:33,200
except the rain
comes from the clouds

1914
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:39,910
sunlight from the sky

1915
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:46,420
and hummingbirds do fly

1916
01:50:48,460 --> 01:50:52,700
young becomes the old

1917
01:50:57,740 --> 01:51:03,340
and mysteries do unfold

1918
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:13,310
that's the way of time

1919
01:51:18,690 --> 01:51:23,600
nothing, no one
remains unchanged

1920
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:32,860
there are so little things

1921
01:51:34,940 --> 01:51:38,680
so few things in life

1922
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:42,310
you can be sure of

1923
01:51:49,930 --> 01:51:54,920
except rain comes
from the clouds

1924
01:51:57,230 --> 01:51:59,790
sunlight from the sky

1925
01:52:02,270 --> 01:52:07,500
and humming birds do fly

1926
01:52:09,510 --> 01:52:14,410
everything's changed

1927
01:52:19,550 --> 01:52:22,610
everything

1928
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:32,670
everything must change
