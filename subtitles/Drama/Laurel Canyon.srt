{1}{1}25.000
{1116}{1186}-You want me to stop?|-No, don't stop. Why'd you stop?
{1190}{1268}I don't know. You moved your leg.|You want me to keep going?
{1272}{1334}Yeah, keep going. Don't stop.
{1462}{1536}Like that. Yeah.
{1540}{1593}Okay. Don't move.
{1597}{1641}Don't stop.
{1645}{1691}Oh, God.
{1695}{1793}Oh, Lord. Oh, Jesus.
{1797}{1841}Fuck me. Fuck me.
{1845}{1900}I'll fuck you.
{1998}{2093}{Y:i}Sam, hi, it's me. You don't need to|pick up. I know you're busy packing.
{2100}{2203}{Y:i}Just calling to say, "Yay!"
{2207}{2286}{Y:i}And listen, I'm kind of in a situation.
{2406}{2479}-What?|-I finished.
{2483}{2533}-You did?|-Yeah.
{2537}{2600}That was really good.
{2650}{2705}What about you?
{2727}{2781}You know, I'm fine.
{2785}{2823}-You sure?|-Yeah.
{2827}{2895}-Okay.|-Yeah, I'm good.
{3120}{3205}Oh, my mother asked|about April again.
{3212}{3323}-Why is she so fixated on April?|-I'm sure it's economic.
{3327}{3373}I can't leave then.
{3377}{3471}I know. She's probably just trying|to get a deal on rentals.
{3475}{3561}-Beat the June rush or something.|-You wanna change the plan?
{3565}{3618}No, I don't. Do you?
{3622}{3670}No.
{3707}{3773}I don't know why people|get married in June anyway.
{3777}{3857}I mean, what's wrong with January?
{4002}{4106}I just never saw the reason to go out|there. It's disruptive, in my opinion.
{4110}{4177}Alex should be here|to finish her dissertation...
{4182}{4276}...and you should stay in Cambridge|if you'll be practicing here.
{4280}{4341}Well, I'd rather be in Cambridge,|absolutely...
{4345}{4438}...but the Hausman Institute|is the best program in the country.
{4442}{4516}I think you should reconsider|psychiatry, Sam.
{4520}{4606}It's a feeble discipline.|If you're interested in brains...
{4610}{4698}...get to the thick of it, the grey matter.|That's honest medicine.
{4702}{4775}Why waste yourself on the hopeless?
{4779}{4833}-So impressive, Alex.|-The M.D. alone is....
{4837}{4901}-It's a tremendous achievement.|-Then the Ph.D.?
{4905}{4965}-I haven't finished it yet.|-Genetics, my God.
{4969}{5033}-Genomics.|-Oh, right, of course. Genomics.
{5037}{5088}How long are you staying|with your mom?
{5093}{5146}-We're not.|-Oh, I thought you were.
{5150}{5261}No, no, we're staying at her house,|but she's not living there now.
{5265}{5338}-She's an executive, isn't she?|-Not exactly.
{5342}{5406}She's in the entertainment industry.
{5410}{5465}She's a record producer.
{5470}{5562}That's right.|Alex mentioned that once.
{5592}{5673}Well, it seems you have|everything under control.
{5677}{5738}Definitely. We've covered everything.
{5750}{5793}Think about my suggestion.
{5797}{5862}Oh, and take care of Alex, please.
{5867}{5931}We don't want her joining|the Scientologists...
{5935}{5986}...or the vegetarians.
{6060}{6093}-You ready?|-Yeah.
{6097}{6187}You can't leave now.|We haven't had the cake.
{6239}{6271}-Q.|-Beautiful.
{6276}{6322}Thank you.
{6370}{6460}Wow, you're behind by 40.|You have to focus.
{6467}{6541}-I am focusing.|-No, you're not. You're distracted.
{6545}{6668}No, I just don't read the dictionary,|smarty-pants.
{6672}{6721}Could I get another juice?
{6725}{6771}Can I get another Scotch, please?
{6776}{6828}You shouldn't worry about it anymore.
{6832}{6888}I didn't plan on worrying|about it at all.
{6892}{7002}-It's not that much time.|-Yeah, theoretically, yeah.
{7017}{7095}Oh, God. I wish I had a Xanax.
{7100}{7146}Well, what did she say, a week?
{7150}{7198}She wasn't specific.
{7202}{7246}Thanks.
{7250}{7286}-Thank you.|-You're welcome.
{7290}{7348}I don't know why you didn't call|her earlier.
{7352}{7421}-Neither do I.|-I could've made other arrangements.
{7425}{7528}I know. I don't know why|I didn't call her back.
{7532}{7587}I should have.
{7772}{7816}Forty-seven.
{12008}{12090}-Whose cars?|-I don't know.
{12157}{12241}-She's really weird.|-I know. You've told me that before.
{12245}{12301}I just wanna re-emphasize.
{12305}{12357}Okay.
{12367}{12468}It's probably|a developmental disorder.
{12472}{12504}Sam.
{12508}{12541}Rarefied strain.
{12546}{12653}-Why are you telling me this again?|-I just don't want you to be surprised.
{12658}{12729}-It's temporary.|-I just don't want you getting upset.
{12782}{12846}Anyone's tolerable for a few weeks...
{12850}{12950}...even the developmentally disabled.
{12997}{13080}Come on. I need to pee.
{14102}{14159}Hey, hi.
{14163}{14241}What time is it? God, look at you.
{14245}{14301}-Oh, man, you look great.|-Thanks.
{14305}{14346}Really.
{14350}{14388}So do you.
{14392}{14448}Sorry. Alex, this is Jane, my mother.
{14452}{14487}Hi, nice to meet you.
{14491}{14556}Nice to meet you too, finally.
{14560}{14600}-It's a pleasure.|-Thanks.
{14605}{14648}Likewise.
{14652}{14703}Hello. I'm lan.
{14707}{14739}One of the crew.
{14743}{14802}lan, Dean, Rowan, Fripp.
{14807}{14852}-Hi.|-Hi.
{14857}{14909}This is my son.
{14914}{14962}Sam.
{14970}{15023}-And....|-Oh, Alex.
{15027}{15081}Alex. God, I'm sorry.
{15089}{15133}It's lovely to meet you, Alex.
{15137}{15188}As well, you, Sam.
{15192}{15235}Yeah.
{15257}{15320}Let's go outside for a second.
{15515}{15555}It's the shit I hate, you know?
{15559}{15643}I give them a gorgeous record,|and they say, "There's no single."
{15647}{15713}No superlatives, no thank-yous,|no congratulations.
{15717}{15766}Just, "Go back in and find it."
{15770}{15817}Otherwise...
{15836}{15904}...I would not be behind.|I'm never behind like this.
{15908}{16017}-Jane, you're always behind like this.|-No, I've changed. Truly, I have.
{17020}{17077}Just take your time|and finish the record...
{17081}{17153}-...and we'll stay in Malibu.|-You can't stay in Malibu.
{17157}{17213}-It's a couple weeks--|-It's Bobby's.
{17217}{17283}-What do you mean?|-I gave the house to Bobby.
{17287}{17350}You gave the house to Bobby?
{17372}{17438}Just for a while,|till he's back up on his feet.
{17442}{17483}He doesn't have feet.
{17487}{17554}-Bobby's a basket case.|-No, I gave him a deadline.
{17558}{17651}-Oh, I'm sure that will motivate him.|-Look....
{17655}{17711}It's complicated.|I feel a little guilty.
{17715}{17781}-Yeah, what?|-I left him.
{17785}{17885}-So you gave him the house?|-It was the right thing to do.
{17897}{18015}Why'd you break up with Bobby?|I thought Bobby was the real thing.
{18022}{18090}Well, then I got to know him.
{18130}{18173}-What do you want to eat?|-Curry.
{18177}{18258}-Sounds good.|-We're going for a bite. Care to join us?
{18263}{18311}No, thanks. We're exhausted.
{18315}{18356}No?
{18361}{18436}Our loss. Other time.
{18500}{18561}-See you, Jane.|-See you, baby. Bye. Later.
{18565}{18613}See you.
{18617}{18651}Hey.
{18655}{18716}-See you in the morning.|-Unless you want to--
{18720}{18781}See you in the morning.
{18785}{18825}Nice to meet you.
{18902}{18941}They don't have a single.
{18945}{19021}I'm sorry. I thought Sam|would've explained how things get.
{19025}{19103}No, he just thought you'd be gone.
{19107}{19160}I mean, finished.
{19164}{19265}Happens a lot in this business. Things|shift, plans change, people get fired.
{19275}{19311}Sure. Of course.
{19315}{19404}What are you gonna do? Things shift,|plans change, people get fired.
{19427}{19518}Yeah, we just hadn't planned|on a change of plan, so....
{19522}{19570}Well, who plans on a change of plan?
{19574}{19655}I mean, that would be sort|of paranoid, don't you think?
{19770}{19846}-Do you want something to drink?|-No, thanks.
{19850}{19961}Look, I think you guys should stay|as long as you want.
{19965}{20013}Really, I want you to be comfortable.
{20018}{20087}This has nothing to do with you.
{20112}{20177}I'm really happy to have you here.
{20187}{20262}-Want some?|-No, thanks. I'm okay.
{20277}{20338}-Sam?|-No.
{20564}{20611}She is so embarrassing.
{20615}{20658}She's fine. She's amusing.
{20662}{20731}Oh, yeah, like a minstrel show.
{20735}{20791}Come on.
{20795}{20883}Well, she's a little odd.
{20887}{20986}Her presentation's a little odd,|but I think she means well.
{20990}{21090}I don't know what she means.|In fact, I never have.
{21107}{21166}You made it sound|like she was autistic.
{21170}{21281}She is, in a way. I mean, she makes|the same mistakes over and over.
{21285}{21413}-She's obviously very accomplished.|-Yeah. The irony of all time.
{21417}{21458}I'm sorry, Al.
{21462}{21541}-What are you sorry about?|-For bringing you here.
{21545}{21616}I should have taken that spot|at Mass General.
{21620}{21688}Your dad was right.|We should've stayed. I fucked up.
{21692}{21770}-Stop it. You didn't fuck up.|-I fucked up.
{21807}{21888}-You didn't tell me she was successful.|-I told you.
{21892}{21946}You've hardly told me anything|about her.
{21950}{22042}-You hardly asked.|-That's not true.
{22517}{22597}-Sleep tight.|-All right.
{22879}{22961}-Do you think Sam likes me?|-No. Why would he?
{22965}{23043}There's nothing to like about you.|You're totally unlikable.
{23047}{23115}You bitch.
{23187}{23250}Wait. Come here, come here.
{23289}{23342}Shit.
{23457}{23538}-I'm sorry, did I wake you?|-Not at all. I can't sleep lately.
{23542}{23626}My clock's fucked. You don't have|to do that. Carmella's coming.
{23630}{23679}-It's no problem.|-Don't cut yourself.
{23683}{23767}Hey, hey, come on, I got it,|really. You're barefoot.
{23855}{23933}-Why are you up?|-I've gotta be at the hospital.
{23937}{24031}-It's so early.|-Yep, it's a real job.
{24035}{24125}-That's too bad.|-No, I don't feel bad about it.
{24182}{24238}-We should spend some time together.|-Yeah.
{24242}{24274}-With Alex.|-Yeah.
{24278}{24356}-She's sweet.|-I think so.
{24360}{24453}Hey, I've got box seats at the Bowl.|Maybe we could do that.
{24457}{24529}The four of us? Get some wine,|some weed, some chicken.
{24533}{24623}-The weather's been fabulous.|-Yeah. I won't have time for a while...
{24627}{24669}-...but I'll let you know.|-Okay.
{24673}{24731}But thanks for the offer.|That sounds nice.
{24735}{24785}Sure.
{24867}{24925}That's your new guy?
{24970}{25011}-How's it going?|-Great.
{25015}{25063}-Yeah?|-He's a beautiful man.
{25075}{25118}-I'm really happy.|-Yeah?
{25122}{25166}We have a really deep connection.
{25171}{25236}Probably deeper than I've had|with anyone...
{25240}{25320}-...even Bobby.|-Wow.
{25332}{25417}Didn't you have a deep connection|with that guy...
{25437}{25495}...Randy?
{25504}{25541}-Randy?|-Yeah, Randy.
{25545}{25613}The roadie with the limp,|lived here when I was 12.
{25617}{25658}-Ronny.|-Ronny.
{25662}{25767}Yeah, I had a connection with Ronny.|It wasn't particularly deep.
{25783}{25841}-What about Veronica?|-Veronica.
{25845}{25913}-You got deep with her.|-We stopped having sex...
{25917}{25974}...after the third month.
{25985}{26021}Anyway...
{26026}{26110}...lan gets me.|This is completely different.
{26142}{26193}Well, that's great.
{26197}{26236}That's great, Jane.
{26257}{26293}Listen...
{26297}{26380}...Alex is...
{26390}{26522}...working hard on her dissertation.
{26560}{26663}And I'd appreciate it if you could keep|it low-key while we're staying here.
{26667}{26735}Just keeping doors shut and stuff.
{26761}{26816}I think she'd appreciate it.
{26820}{26888}-I want her to feel comfortable here.|-Yeah, so do I.
{26892}{26978}You know, this situation's|kind of foreign to her.
{26983}{27107}She's used to working|in a lab or an office, alone.
{27112}{27161}She's not used|to being around people.
{27165}{27245}Wow, she must get Ionely.
{27312}{27364}Okay.
{27497}{27553}Okay.
{28940}{29021}Claudia, I'm not gonna slap|some bullshit together for radio.
{29025}{29108}{Y:i}-I don't work that way, you know that.|-I hear you. It's all good.
{29113}{29165}There's a slot open,|and we need to jump.
{29169}{29229}I gotta have all my elements|for the holidays.
{29233}{29288}-We need to move units.|-Christmas?
{29292}{29353}-Fuck that.|-Oh, Claudia...
{29357}{29433}...please don't take me there.|Please, don't depress me.
{29437}{29501}I don't care about Christmas.|Fuck Christmas.
{29506}{29596}This isn't Nat King Cole. You know that.|Why are you up my ass?
{29601}{29651}This is why we get|in trouble with you.
{29656}{29737}And this is why you always end up|coming back to me, Claudia.
{29810}{29863}God, I love that woman.
{29867}{29955}-Where are we?|-Two minutes.
{29987}{30056}Okay, this is the locked ward,|obviously...
{30060}{30126}...and these are the patients|in the locked ward...
{30130}{30250}...some of whom you'll be getting|to know intimately very, very soon.
{30287}{30319}I'm not stealing them.
{30324}{30376}You took my medication.
{30380}{30471}It's down your sleeve.|It's in her sleeve.
{30581}{30693}Sara Golan, second-year resident|extraordinaire.
{30697}{30733}Meet the new recruits.
{30737}{30789}-Hello.|-Hi.
{30810}{30901}I think I'm bringing them down.|Tell them it's not so bad.
{30905}{30946}It's not so bad.
{30950}{31032}You see, it's not so bad.
{31080}{31147}All right, onward.
{31320}{31396}Christmas. Slots and units.|In a limited universe.
{31400}{31465}-It's depressing, really.|-So up your Wellbutrin.
{31469}{31502}Rather have Vicodin.
{31506}{31561}Move that unit, lady in the tracksuit.
{31566}{31656}-You know what I think?|-I don't, but I'm dying to.
{31660}{31771}I think we made a beautiful record|and cowards notice last.
{31775}{31807}You're very deep.
{31811}{31858}-You think so?|-I do...
{31862}{31932}-...when you're not talking.|-Fuck off.
{32650}{32696}Oh, I'm sorry.|Let me turn it down.
{32700}{32753}No, it's fine, really.
{32757}{32828}So, what are you working on|upstairs?
{32833}{32906}-Excuse me?|-You seem exceedingly absorbed.
{32910}{32961}Oh, I'm writing.
{32965}{33036}-What, a novel?|-No, my dissertation.
{33040}{33096}Brilliant. What's it on?
{33100}{33166}-What's it on?|-You have a subject?
{33171}{33211}Specifically?
{33215}{33303}Yeah. We went to university.|We can handle it.
{33320}{33418}The genomic determinance of sexual|behaviour in the drosophila fruit fly...
{33422}{33489}...and its implications|for Homo sapiens.
{33494}{33566}Really? The sex life of flies?
{33570}{33651}No, the reproductive behaviour...
{33655}{33738}...of the fruit fly.
{33742}{33776}Excuse me.
{33780}{33893}Oh, he didn't mean it, Alex.|Honestly, he's got low self-esteem.
{33897}{33975}He had acne as a child.
{33980}{34036}You cunts.
{34147}{34191}-Hey.|-Hey.
{34195}{34296}Yeah, there's not much in here.|We've been doing takeout lately.
{34300}{34391}Oh, that's okay.|Is there a store nearby?
{34395}{34463}-Why don't you join us?|-Oh, no, l--
{34467}{34538}Seriously, Alex, you don't have|to be polite with me.
{34542}{34613}Polite isn't my thing.|I'm sure Sam told you that.
{34617}{34731}No, I wasn't being polite.|I should just get some air.
{34735}{34787}Air's good.
{34815}{34895}Always better than a cocktail|at this hour.
{34957}{35058}We'd like you to listen|to the record sometime if you want.
{35062}{35116}Oh, sure.
{35120}{35183}Yeah, I'd like to. I'd like that. Thanks.
{35187}{35228}Well, you'd be helping us out.
{35232}{35305}It's like a psychic sauna in there.|We're wasted.
{35310}{35401}Well, I'd love to listen,|but I don't think I'd be much help.
{35405}{35485}I don't really know anything|about popular music.
{35490}{35522}Sure, you do.
{35526}{35624}Anyone with instinct knows about|popular music. That's why it's popular.
{35672}{35756}You strike me as someone|with strong instincts.
{35760}{35798}I guess so.
{35807}{35916}Well, you know when you're repulsed|and when you're turned on, right?
{35920}{36011}I suppose so, in general, I guess.
{36016}{36128}That's all it is. Either it pulls you in|or it leaves you cold.
{36162}{36225}Sorry, you want some?|It's great for the colon.
{36237}{36279}Oh, no, thanks.
{36667}{36735}And they're definitely taking it?
{36752}{36820}Okay, thank you.
{37088}{37151}Hi, I'm calling about the apartment.
{37155}{37233}Is it? Okay. All right, thanks.
{37292}{37327}Everything all right?
{37430}{37476}Yeah.
{38097}{38138}What'd you get?
{38142}{38216}-Food.|-Good timing. I'm famished.
{38220}{38311}-Get on.|-No, I'm fine. I need the exercise.
{38315}{38397}You'll have a heart attack|dragging that load up the mountain.
{38401}{38433}No, it's fine, really.
{38437}{38508}Jane asked me to get you,|sweetheart. Get on.
{38710}{38786}I promise I won't tell your parents.
{38790}{38853}You really didn't have to get me.|I'm fine.
{38857}{38910}Now, hold on to me.
{38965}{39017}Tighter.
{39160}{39258}-So where are you staying now?|-Up in Laurel Canyon.
{39262}{39358}It's just that the house we're in|was supposed to be empty...
{39362}{39466}...but my mother is producing|a record there.
{39470}{39548}And she moved in because she left|her boyfriend...
{39552}{39621}...and she gave him|her beach house...
{39625}{39681}...because....
{39685}{39776}Well, anyway, it's convoluted|and not very interesting.
{39780}{39868}No, it's definitely interesting.
{39872}{39961}It'll work out. Really, it's more|a logistics issue at the moment.
{40062}{40166}-That was you in the car, right?|-Yeah.
{40170}{40203}You almost killed me.
{40207}{40251}Yeah, well....
{40255}{40330}-Yeah, I'm sorry.|-You should be.
{40428}{40533}It was unbelievable. Every call I made,|someone had just nabbed it.
{40537}{40618}I'm fine staying here, honey.|I don't mind. Really, I don't.
{40622}{40708}She's in your way, Al, you know?|I mean, she has no boundaries.
{40712}{40771}-You need your privacy.|-She's not in my way.
{40775}{40831}I'm working in private.|It's not a problem.
{40835}{40867}What about the noise?
{40871}{40931}They've been respectful|when the door's closed.
{40935}{41011}-What about when it's not closed?|-Well, then it's open.
{41015}{41071}-Can you hear them?|-No, not really.
{41075}{41136}"Not really," what is that?|That's yes, right?
{41140}{41211}No, that means, no, not really.
{41215}{41321}Al, don't get technical. I'm just trying|to work it out. I'm just trying to help.
{41325}{41397}-You are?|-Yeah, I am.
{41432}{41501}-Can she pick you up tomorrow?|-She said she could.
{41505}{41583}-Okay, then I'll start looking.|-Well, good. That'd be good.
{41587}{41641}Maybe we should look in the Valley.
{41645}{41759}It's cheaper and quieter.|North Hollywood or something.
{41907}{41971}Yeah, Mickey's here.|Everybody's here. Come over.
{41975}{42057}I'm not talking about work.|I've got a band with me.
{42102}{42167}-Hey!|-Hey.
{42186}{42246}You didn't have to go out.|We made tofu steaks.
{42250}{42301}Oh, yeah? Sorry we missed that.
{42305}{42373}-What have you got there?|-Pizza.
{42377}{42410}You want some?
{42425}{42475}Lovely.
{42531}{42567}Delicious.
{42572}{42604}Real meat.
{42672}{42767}-Whose kid is that?|-Oh, that's Rowan's baby, China.
{42807}{42892}Come here, you little heartbreaker.
{42927}{42978}Are you cold?
{42982}{43020}Meet my friend, Alex.
{43025}{43088}Say hello. "Hello."
{43092}{43136}-You want your dad?|-Yeah.
{43140}{43195}Neglectful dad.
{43245}{43345}-Can I get you two a drink?|-Sure.
{43715}{43750}Hello?
{43754}{43812}Hi. Is Sam there?
{43835}{43883}-Sugar?|-Please. Thank you.
{43887}{43931}I'm really sorry I woke you up.
{43935}{44045}No. I'm usually up before 6.|I overslept.
{44060}{44125}Morning. Sorry.
{44142}{44231}-Should we go?|-Well, Alex made coffee.
{44235}{44310}-Do we have time?|-I think so. I drive fast.
{44320}{44375}Okay.
{44382}{44421}Thanks for picking him up.
{44425}{44501}I wasn't expecting to be|apartment hunting. We weren't.
{44505}{44598}It's not a problem. Really,|I'm happy to. It's right on my way.
{44602}{44693}-That's convenient. Where do you live?|-In the Valley.
{44698}{44750}North Hollywood.
{44807}{44898}-Why can't you stay up here?|-It's a little tight, with everyone....
{44902}{44978}That's too bad. It's really nice.
{44982}{45053}I'd sacrifice space|to be up here any day.
{45097}{45185}-Are you a resident?|-Second-year.
{45193}{45256}-What do you do?|-I'm writing my dissertation.
{45260}{45320}-What on?|-Drosophila genomics.
{45330}{45446}-She's an M.D. as well.|-Wow, that's very impressive.
{45450}{45523}-Not really.|-Oh, it impresses me.
{45540}{45612}-Thank you.|-You must have a lot of patience.
{45617}{45746}I don't know, I couldn't imagine|analysing data all day. It seems so...
{45750}{45796}...tedious.
{45800}{45844}Well, it's not meaningless at all.
{45849}{45937}No, no. I didn't say meaningless.|Did I?
{45945}{46057}My English is terrible. I'm sorry.|I said tedious, I think.
{46065}{46102}Well, same difference.
{46106}{46168}But I didn't mean that. I meant....
{46173}{46208}I don't know the word.
{46212}{46251}Serious. That's all.
{46255}{46308}It's fine. Sorry, I didn't mean to--
{46312}{46409}No, no. I'm sorry, really.|I didn't mean the assault.
{46414}{46468}Insult. We should probably go.
{46602}{46671}-Well, it was nice meeting you.|-Yeah, you too.
{46675}{46725}Bye.
{46789}{46856}-Your girlfriend seems nice.|-Yeah.
{46860}{46938}She was tired.|She's usually more....
{46942}{47016}She's usually different.
{47020}{47093}A double degree.|She must love school.
{47097}{47163}Yeah. She got through fast.
{47167}{47215}She's really smart.
{47220}{47268}Yeah, she must be.
{47272}{47308}And ambitious.
{47312}{47345}Well, yeah.
{47395}{47453}Top in our class, actually.
{47457}{47493}Really?
{47497}{47540}Yeah.
{47544}{47607}How can you compete with that?
{48547}{48644}Methamphetamines, Ecstasy, generic,|ice. We're not sure what he took.
{48648}{48728}Vital signs haven't stabilized.|Page me if you have questions.
{48732}{48796}Thanks. You wanna start?
{48800}{48868}-No, he's yours.|-Okay.
{48873}{48938}-How you doing, Wyatt?|-I'm fucked up, okay?
{48942}{49038}Nazis are in the parking lot, waiting|to bang me, and I'm trapped in here.
{49042}{49132}Okay. How old are you?
{49142}{49193}-Eighteen.|-You have any family around?
{49197}{49253}No, I don't have any family, asshole.
{49257}{49361}Leave my fucking family out of it, you|paranoid Nazi freak in a white coat.
{49365}{49413}-Sit down.|-Leave my family out of it.
{49417}{49482}511 stat, okay? Wyatt, sit down.
{49486}{49586}Sit down. Sit down.
{49635}{49676}Okay.
{49680}{49782}What the fuck is 511, huh?|What the fuck is that?
{49786}{49851}Is that a fucking code?|Is that a fucking code?
{49856}{49907}Is that a fucking prison code?
{49920}{49975}Is that a fucking prison code?
{49981}{50020}Don't fucking take me out.
{50024}{50059}Please God, don't.
{50064}{50116}Don't fucking take me out.|Please don't.
{50120}{50156}Please don't take me out.
{50161}{50210}-It's okay.|-Please don't.
{50433}{50538}I'm not feeling that. What's up|with the gallop? The tempo's shit.
{50543}{50621}-I'm right. Right?|-Yep, tempo's shit.
{50743}{50826}No, no, no, no.|Let us get into it.
{50842}{50926}It's gonna have texture.|Like, you know, like ooze.
{50941}{50993}Sonic ooze.
{51000}{51071}Great. Sonic ooze.
{51113}{51161}Okay, baby, how about|a horn section?
{51165}{51235}A little Tijuana Brass, maybe?|I heard Herb's in town.
{51239}{51310}-Let's not get patronizing.|-That's not patronizing.
{51314}{51357}That was accommodating.
{51361}{51409}I was accommodating you.
{51461}{51516}Against my better judgment, even.
{54889}{54975}-Sweet, that's it. That's the direction.|-I've overplayed it.
{54979}{55038}No. We just gotta|straighten out the beat.
{55043}{55125}-It should be faster.|-No, I get what she's doing. It's sultry.
{55129}{55166}She's going for romantic.
{55186}{55237}Is that what you're going for, Jane?
{55244}{55273}A love song?
{55369}{55397}Come on!
{55401}{55485}Let him go. No, let him go!|Let me at him!
{55489}{55518}Those are mine.
{55523}{55569}-What are?|-Your tits.
{55574}{55626}You're such a brute.
{55698}{55740}Hello.
{55770}{55796}Hi.
{55872}{55947}-Am I interrupting?|-Absolutely not.
{55951}{56001}It's an unexpected pleasure,|really.
{56005}{56058}We were just discussing romance.
{56091}{56154}Come on in. Sit down, come on.
{56365}{56440}-I'll see you tomorrow.|-Yeah.
{56445}{56482}Have a good night.
{57733}{57797}I'm really starting to love this.
{57816}{57851}It's dated, you know?
{57855}{57957}It's not dated. We just wrote it.|It doesn't even have a date on it yet.
{57961}{58046}-Why are you so contrary?|-You wouldn't respect me otherwise.
{58050}{58098}-You think so?|-Babe...
{58102}{58145}-...I know so.|-Good.
{58149}{58211}I love a man who|speaks his mind...
{58248}{58298}...even when it's bullshit.
{58786}{58826}Hey, stranger.
{58948}{58998}-Hey, you.|-Hey.
{59072}{59121}What time did you come to bed?
{59125}{59164}-I tried to wake you.|-Really?
{59168}{59225}-You didn't move.|-I didn't even feel it.
{59234}{59269}How did it go yesterday?
{59285}{59360}-With the apartments.|-Good.
{59390}{59421}What's the status?
{59426}{59500}I saw a few things.|Most of them were pretty disgusting.
{59526}{59614}Yeah. I think it's gonna|take some time.
{59694}{59783}I was sure there was something|perfect in here, just ready to rent.
{59816}{59863}So how was work yesterday?
{59868}{59937}Strange. I had to deal|with a 16-year-old...
{59941}{60041}...having an Ecstasy-induced psychotic|episode, and he thought I was a Nazi.
{60045}{60080}How ironic.
{60084}{60128}-Yeah.|-And upsetting.
{60133}{60167}Yeah, he was pretty upset.
{60171}{60221}-I'm sure.|-This one looks good.
{60226}{60299}-Which one?|-This house in the Valley...
{60304}{60350}...on Greenleaf.
{60369}{60401}Right there.
{60444}{60481}Okay.
{60573}{60623}Were you in the studio|for a long time?
{60627}{60673}-No, not long.|-Just taking a break?
{60678}{60709}Yeah.
{60716}{60765}-Did you get much work done?|-Yeah.
{60769}{60839}I think they're pretty close|to finishing.
{60862}{60911}No, on your...
{60915}{60948}...dissertation.
{60960}{61018}Oh. Yeah, it's going really well.
{61022}{61077}-Did you enjoy yourself?|-Where?
{61082}{61113}In the studio.
{61118}{61160}Yeah, I did, actually.
{61164}{61222}-It was stimulating.|-Good.
{61226}{61262}Jesus.
{61299}{61409}I don't know how you two stand getting|up so early. That totally burned me out.
{61499}{61527}-Hello.|-Hi.
{61532}{61571}You're right on time.
{61590}{61654}Oh, he's very friendly.|He's a pussycat.
{61672}{61723}You see that?|He likes you already.
{61727}{61788}Come on in.|I'll show you the house.
{61856}{61938}I want you to take the gown|out of your bag and put it on.
{61942}{62039}-This isn't appropriate for public.|-You don't understand naked.
{62044}{62084}Naked is inner.
{62104}{62190}I am here with you.|There is no shame.
{62194}{62240}There is no separation.
{62254}{62279}And...
{62297}{62341}...I'm not ill.
{62351}{62397}Yes, you are ill, Gloria.
{62409}{62505}And I have no need|for a green synthetic nightie...
{62509}{62603}...used to conceal the essence|of my supple skin...
{62607}{62647}...and my aching soul...
{62652}{62733}...in the barren desert|that is this land.
{62746}{62803}I'm moving in with my son|in Costa Mesa.
{62807}{62878}He thinks I'm Ionely.|Truth is, he's Ionely.
{62882}{62955}Sweet kid.|Just can't seem to connect.
{62989}{63053}Me and my wife lived here 40 years.
{63057}{63131}It's lovely, really.
{63135}{63180}It's really lovely.
{63185}{63282}You seem like a very nice person.|I hope you take the place.
{63618}{63705}-Come on.|-Come on! You're nothing!
{63825}{63850}Come on!
{63854}{63893}Pussy!
{63902}{63964}Fucking pussy!
{64057}{64094}I don't know about trust.
{64098}{64156}Maybe she just needed a nap|or something.
{64160}{64189}Believe me.
{64193}{64249}She's been belligerent|with everybody else.
{64253}{64303}I dealt with her last year.
{64310}{64363}I just listened to her, really.
{64367}{64426}Yeah. Well, listening...
{64430}{64510}...it's better than medicating,|no matter what they tell you.
{64602}{64666}Can I tell you something?
{64685}{64751}Yeah. Sure.
{64853}{64884}Hi.
{64888}{64936}-Hi.|-Hi.
{65009}{65078}-Hi, how are you?|-Fine, thanks. You?
{65082}{65142}Fine, thanks.|Did I leave you enough room?
{65173}{65227}Oh, yeah. Yeah.
{65235}{65302}I'll see you in the morning.
{65604}{65665}Another day at the office.
{65688}{65720}All right.
{65725}{65785}-Hey, how's it going?|-Good, you?
{65795}{65820}Okay.
{65824}{65886}Hey, come on in the water.|It's delicious.
{65891}{65941}Maybe later. Thanks.
{65945}{66024}You're always welcome.|In fact, more than welcome.
{66081}{66171}Obviously, you're welcome.|Fucking hell, it's your house.
{66294}{66360}-I'm sorry.|-It's not your fault.
{66364}{66449}Someone else got there first.|The house was gone.
{66524}{66633}It wouldn't be the worst thing to stay|here a little longer. It's comfortable.
{66638}{66720}Well, depends on your definition|of comfort.
{66742}{66866}I mean, Al, I'm hardly ever here.|It's not for me, it's for you.
{66887}{66921}Is it?
{67258}{67353}-Can you get me some lemonade?|-I'll see if there's some around.
{67371}{67446}-How'd you sleep?|-I don't know.
{67450}{67530}Whatever you hit me with took me|down. I feel fucking drugged.
{67534}{67597}Yeah, well, you were drugged.
{67610}{67701}-I don't like downers.|-You weren't liking the uppers either.
{67705}{67741}Yeah.
{67747}{67839}-I told you not to call my house.|-Look, I had to contact your family.
{67844}{67891}You're underage. That's the law.
{67899}{67965}My mom's gonna kick my ass.
{67972}{68008}I mean, she's freaking now.
{68012}{68090}But she's gonna torch my fucking ass|when I get out of here.
{68094}{68157}Why are things so wrong|with your mom?
{68161}{68199}I don't know.
{68220}{68255}You seem like you do.
{68284}{68338}She just doesn't get me, all right?
{68342}{68440}She's in my face about my grades,|my hair, my friends, tattoos.
{68444}{68516}All this other shit. You know?
{68561}{68623}I can't do nothing right.
{68627}{68675}So why should I care?
{68975}{69000}Fuck.
{69004}{69054}-What?|-He missed the punch, fucked up--
{69058}{69157}Mickey, could you keep that to yourself|next time, let him play through?
{69161}{69206}Let me talk to him.
{69210}{69285}Sorry. Yeah. It's not there,|but that's a direction.
{69311}{69348}-It's okay?|-Yeah.
{69353}{69427}We'll finesse it in the mix.|We'll make it work.
{69559}{69595}What do you think?
{69599}{69689}-Truthfully?|-No, lie to me. Yeah, truthfully.
{69734}{69776}I'm not feeling it.
{69797}{69837}You're not feeling it.
{69848}{69902}-I'm sorry.|-That's okay. Don't apologize.
{69906}{69948}Just tell me what you mean.
{69952}{70041}I don't know what I mean, exactly.|I just.... I mean, l--
{70054}{70186}I guess it's just not pulling me in.|Or it feels like it's not pulling them in...
{70200}{70272}...exactly.... Or enough.
{70304}{70339}I don't know.
{70396}{70457}They don't seem inspired.
{70487}{70526}Inspired?
{70751}{70811}-Yeah?|-Progress report.
{70816}{70859}Excuse me?
{70864}{70920}Progress report?|No, "Hello, how are you?"
{70924}{71003}Jesus, Claudia, you're really warming|me up.
{71060}{71097}What?
{71129}{71221}I love capitalism as much as|the next guy, but this is off the charts.
{71225}{71291}Your commerce is so far up|my ass, I can't sit up.
{71295}{71359}Listen, the Age of Aquarius|never happened, okay?
{71363}{71443}{Y:i}-Get real. This is commerce.|-I want to tell you something...
{71447}{71521}...for your soul. Pushing for Christmas|and radio play...
{71525}{71589}...will only amount to shit|and wrapping paper.
{71605}{71702}I don't know what happened, Jane.|We really used to be on the same page.
{71715}{71771}I don't know what happened|either, Claudia.
{71775}{71819}I guess you started exercising.
{71824}{71869}{Y:i}Gotta go.
{71882}{71921}Bitch.
{71943}{71980}Cunt.
{72124}{72188}Can we just say how lovely|Jane looks today?
{72193}{72269}Can we just have a moment|of appreciation for our sweet...
{72273}{72304}...Iovely Jane?
{72418}{72448}Jane rocks.
{72527}{72576}Get the fuck out of my chair.
{72585}{72687}I had a math teacher in high school|who was sort of my mentor.
{72704}{72773}You know, I was one|of those science geeks...
{72777}{72825}...and my mother wasn't really around.
{72846}{72918}So he took me under his wing,|and he convinced me...
{72922}{72963}...that I should be a doctor.
{72967}{73044}Which seemed like the right idea|at the time.
{73062}{73143}You know, I guess I needed|to prove myself.
{73148}{73174}To who?
{73218}{73281}Who were you trying|to prove yourself to?
{73313}{73388}I don't know. My math teacher?
{73403}{73448}Your math teacher?
{73459}{73539}You got through Harvard Medical|School for your math teacher?
{73543}{73574}Yeah, no.
{73578}{73664}I guess I was trying|to prove myself to myself.
{73668}{73720}You know, I needed...
{73724}{73801}-...to prove that I wasn't a loser.|-A loser?
{73806}{73857}Why would you think|you're a loser?
{73862}{73960}I was around a lot of losers|growing up and....
{73965}{74044}Not worthless-type loser...
{74048}{74108}...or, you know, bad person. Just....
{74120}{74163}Just lost. People at loose ends.
{74167}{74219}And I didn't want to be that.
{74223}{74310}I wanted to be anything but that.
{74358}{74414}You're everything but that.
{74464}{74515}I set up a meeting with his mom.
{74519}{74581}It's not protocol,|but I think it'll help.
{74585}{74624}Is he still violent?
{74628}{74693}No. No, he was never violent.
{74715}{74776}I thought you had to restrain him.
{74784}{74831}No, I sedated him.
{74841}{74920}-Oh, I thought he was psychotic.|-Huh? No.
{74937}{75026}He had a psychotic episode.|He OD'd on...
{75030}{75074}...methamphetamines. But...
{75078}{75139}...he's not psychotic in general.
{75275}{75339}{Y:i}When did you start reading|Spin magazine?
{75343}{75431}-I'm not really reading it.|-You just looking at it?
{75435}{75482}I'm skimming it.
{75502}{75580}-Is it helping?|-Yeah, it's informative.
{75584}{75677}-It's good for an overview.|-What, like a primer?
{75681}{75784}-Yeah, something like that.|-Getting the basics, a light survey...
{75788}{75842}...of popular culture.
{75862}{75926}-Are you teasing me?|-No.
{75935}{75995}{Y:i}Should I be reading|the Journal of Medicine...
{75999}{76074}{Y:i}...or the Harvard Review?|Would that be more appropriate?
{76078}{76206}-Something more scholarly?|-No, come on, Al. I was teasing.
{76233}{76344}I could harass you about those porno|magazines, but I didn't even bring it up.
{76418}{76466}Wha--?
{76489}{76579}Come on. I don't care about|the porno magazines.
{76595}{76669}{Y:i}-I just didn't know you liked Juggs.|-Oh, God.
{76702}{76825}-Sorry I don't have enormous breasts.|-Please, stop it. Your breasts are fine.
{76843}{76878}Your breasts are...
{76893}{76924}...perfect.
{76943}{76977}Really.
{77136}{77202}Yeah, but who's had 72 lovers?
{77206}{77266}Where did you come up|with that fucking number?
{77270}{77342}I'm guessing from what you said.
{77346}{77403}Well, I'm 16 years older than you.
{77407}{77469}That's a lifetime of fucking.
{77473}{77563}And I am not apologizing.|My past isn't about you.
{77567}{77647}-Oh, that is cold.|-No, it's not. It's clear.
{77692}{77756}You're gonna keep me|in my place, are you?
{77760}{77815}I'm not gonna keep you anywhere.
{77831}{77921}You are free to move around.
{77925}{77990}Well, I'm not moving,|for your information.
{78028}{78120}You can work your tough-girl thing,|but I know you're in love with me.
{78167}{78214}That's irrelevant.
{79038}{79083}Kind of...
{79087}{79133}...tired, babe.
{79140}{79174}You know?
{80067}{80159}-You're up early.|-I know, and I'm not happy about it.
{80163}{80245}-You need some Valium?|-I don't wanna get back into that again.
{80249}{80309}Yeah, that wouldn't be good.
{80313}{80376}Try swimming. It helps.
{80391}{80464}-So how are you? How's work going?|-Good.
{80468}{80535}-Just not sleeping enough myself.|-Oh, I'm sure.
{80539}{80620}-Hospital's been busy.|-A lot of psychos, huh?
{80624}{80680}No, just a lot of...
{80684}{80741}...pained souls.
{80843}{80932}Listen, I appreciate your interest|in Alex.
{80936}{80994}I meant to tell you that.
{80998}{81100}I really like Alex. I like her a lot.|She's smart.
{81117}{81190}I was a little protective of her|when we first got here.
{81194}{81301}I just wasn't sure how she was|gonna deal with your scene.
{81305}{81382}I think she's dealing just fine|with my scene.
{81386}{81477}I think she likes it. Obviously,|she's getting stoned with you...
{81481}{81583}{Y:i}-...and she's reading Spin.|-I don't read Spin. I've never read Spin.
{81598}{81705}She found her own way into the studio.|It had nothing to do with me.
{81717}{81762}Yeah.
{81774}{81849}It's always like that with you,|isn't it? They....
{81861}{81933}They always just happen|to find their way in.
{81937}{81997}What's that supposed to mean?
{82042}{82120}It means you're charmed,|that's all.
{82124}{82164}Someone's looking out for you.
{82168}{82225}Nobody's looking out for you?|I'm sorry.
{82229}{82293}Come on. Your life looks good|from my perspective.
{82297}{82376}-I've worked for what I have.|-And I haven't?
{82399}{82472}-You are so stuck on the negative.|-I'm not.
{82476}{82520}Yes, you are.
{82527}{82658}-You've blocked out all the fun we had.|-I haven't blocked it out. It's all filed.
{82662}{82726}What about the trip to Veracruz?
{82730}{82796}Yeah. When Ronny went to jail?
{82800}{82855}Before that, when we were out|on his boat.
{82859}{82927}In the storm? That was fun?|That sucked.
{82931}{82992}No, it didn't.|You thought it was exciting.
{82996}{83071}I wasn't excited. I was hysterical.
{83075}{83197}There's a huge difference|between hysteria and excitement.
{83277}{83358}Are we ever gonna have|a relationship?
{83384}{83509}We're having a relationship.|Here we are, having it.
{83520}{83588}lan's got a room at the Chateau.|We'll stay there...
{83592}{83666}-...you can have the place to yourself.|-You should stay.
{83670}{83804}Alex is still looking for an apartment,|and we need something permanent...
{83808}{83853}...so just stay.
{83857}{83951}Why don't you ask her? Maybe|she wants to be alone in the interim.
{83970}{84018}I'm sure Alex wants you to stay.
{84022}{84117}I mean, she can't stay away from you|as it is.
{84431}{84477}He's gonna give her a frontal lobe.
{84481}{84568}No, no, he'll just give her Thorazine|and then lock her up.
{84597}{84655}I think she wants to be locked up.
{84659}{84708}Yeah, exactly.
{84712}{84756}{Y:i}Make your analysis at first...
{84760}{84848}{Y:i}... with three general patterns|of emotional response.
{84852}{84977}{Y:i}Rage is the response|to the primary stimulus of thwarting.
{84981}{85080}-Should I be embarrassed for us?|-I am. I really am.
{85096}{85142}You gonna have another?
{85146}{85229}-You know, I should probably go.|-Oh, come on, Golan.
{85233}{85295}How often do you get a night|and a morning off?
{85380}{85449}-I'd stay for another.|-Okay.
{85453}{85510}{Y:i}--and the emotional response to love...
{85514}{85623}{Y:i}... is usually the result|of a show of affection or favour.
{85627}{85728}-Tom, can I use your phone?|-Yeah, it's right over there.
{85796}{85873}-I think we'd do really well together.|-Absolutely.
{85877}{85910}For a while.
{85914}{85996}God, will you get past the cynicism?
{86000}{86070}I just broke up with somebody, baby.
{86090}{86149}I thought you forgot all about him.
{86199}{86232}{Y:i}Hello?
{86236}{86269}Al?
{86335}{86425}{Y:i}-Who are you with?|-Just some of the residents.
{86492}{86637}I'd like to leave, but Sara's driving,|and I don't want to be rude.
{86663}{86702}You want to come down?
{86715}{86781}No. I'll see you when you get home.
{86793}{86838}All right.
{87164}{87217}You're ageist.
{87221}{87264}-That's what it is.|-Oh, please.
{87268}{87319}Then what are you afraid of?
{87323}{87368}Breaking your heart.
{87372}{87455}Running your ass|into the ground, buddy.
{87459}{87507}Bollocks.
{87662}{87750}Why do you want to ruin this|with domesticity?
{87789}{87837}Because...
{87852}{87914}...I've never met a braver woman...
{87918}{88005}...and I'm deeply, deeply|attached to you.
{88214}{88274}Looks like we've got company.
{88556}{88634}-How you doing, Alex?|-Okay, I think.
{88638}{88729}-Getting some work done?|-No. Not tonight.
{88733}{88790}-Where's Sam?|-Out.
{88794}{88834}What, without you?
{88849}{88917}-Well, I didn't want to go.|-Pour yourself a drink.
{88921}{88989}-Spend time with us.|-Get a drink and come back out.
{88993}{89077}-Are you sure?|-She's sure. I'm positive.
{89172}{89246}I'll have another whisky sour|while you're at the bar.
{89250}{89304}So will Jane.
{89952}{90002}Cheers.
{90146}{90187}Tasty, eh?
{90191}{90248}It's a good combination.
{90252}{90332}You made it perfectly.|You should be a bartender.
{90412}{90487}-Do you want to come in?|-No, that's okay.
{90491}{90576}-You sure?|-Yeah, I'm okay.
{90580}{90634}Oh, have you|just washed your hair?
{90638}{90695}-No, I haven't.|-So?
{90719}{90801}So I just don't want to get wet.
{90805}{90881}Really? You seem like you do.
{90885}{90949}-Cut it out.|-What? She wants to swim.
{90953}{91028}-She's afraid to get wet.|-I'm not afraid.
{91218}{91268}You little tart.
{91272}{91326}You know what, you've had it.
{91361}{91470}-Shit! God! I can't believe you!|-See what I have to put up with?
{91474}{91533}-It's not so bad, is it?|-It's freezing.
{91537}{91603}That's because|your clothes are wet, silly.
{91607}{91720}-You really are a jackass. God!|-No. No name-calling now.
{91724}{91788}We're all adults here.
{92390}{92484}-That's better, isn't it?|-Well, it's definitely warmer.
{92488}{92594}I'd much rather be in here|than out there in that cold world.
{92646}{92701}You're so polite, Alex.
{92705}{92803}It's okay to leave the ivory tower|and live a little.
{94393}{94475}-Yes. I can drive.|-Well, you shouldn't. You're drunk.
{94479}{94539}I'm not drunk.|I drank less than you.
{94543}{94596}No, you did not.
{94655}{94768}-Well, you want to kill me again?|-I didn't kill you the first time, did I?
{94882}{94985}-Goddamn it, you're flustering me.|-Turn it to the right.
{94989}{95066}-I know how to open a door.|-Apparently, you don't.
{95070}{95160}-Give me a break. I'm drunk.|-You should let me drive.
{95265}{95315}Get in.
{95682}{95732}Sara.
{95736}{95783}Yeah?
{95817}{95912}I think we should take the high road.
{95926}{95982}What would that be?
{96052}{96102}Sublimation.
{96220}{96277}Is that okay?
{96319}{96363}It's intellectual.
{96398}{96469}-I know.|-Not very honest.
{96473}{96523}Well....
{96537}{96604}Not very satisfactory.
{96612}{96662}Satisfying.
{96675}{96745}I think you know what I mean.
{97608}{97654}Al?
{97667}{97702}Hey.
{97706}{97746}Al?
{97752}{97798}You up?
{97802}{97834}-Hi.|-You up?
{97838}{97934}-I am now.|-Can we talk?
{97972}{98015}Okay.
{98019}{98100}-Are you okay?|-Yeah. I'm just...
{98141}{98206}...wondering about something.
{98229}{98281}Okay.
{98326}{98438}Why does your father|hate psychiatrists?
{98442}{98504}He doesn't hate psychiatrists.
{98517}{98575}Okay, so...
{98579}{98632}...why does he hate me?
{98636}{98718}He doesn't hate you.|He thinks you're great.
{98776}{98844}Why are you concerned about|what he thinks suddenly?
{98855}{98937}You know, he's a puritan.|He quotes Proust and wears tweed.
{98941}{98985}He doesn't know anything about us.
{98989}{99073}Do you think that we should've...
{99077}{99143}...gotten married before?
{99147}{99205}Before when?
{99209}{99275}Before coming out here?
{100679}{100809}He runs around, spends my money on|drugs and ends up in a mental hospital!
{100813}{100912}Oh, I'm so close to letting go on him.|I'm at the end of my rope here.
{100916}{101001}I think that what's going on with Wyatt|is complicated...
{101005}{101094}...and I don't think your anger|is helping him with his problems.
{101098}{101130}My anger?
{101134}{101190}I'm not angry. I'm furious!
{101194}{101252}Because this is all about me,|you see.
{101256}{101331}I will not tolerate disgusting,|degenerate behaviour...
{101335}{101387}...and disrespect for me|and my values--
{101391}{101480}Mrs. Jones, listen. Give your values|a rest for a second.
{101484}{101516}Your kid's in trouble.
{103071}{103106}Yeah.
{103110}{103207}Oh, Jesus, Claudia.|Give me a fucking break.
{103241}{103309}My relationship with lan|has nothing to do with this.
{103313}{103383}It's none of your business anyway.
{103407}{103496}No. It is not slowing anything down.
{103500}{103580}These conversations|are slowing us down.
{103584}{103685}I can't believe I'm listening to this.|That was totally patronizing.
{103711}{103795}Claudia. It's lan McKnight.
{103815}{103904}Lovely. I don't know why you're|so fascinated with our sex life...
{103908}{103984}...but for the record,|Jane's an amazing shag.
{104027}{104106}More to the point, we're just|about done with the single.
{104110}{104230}I'm sure you'll be orgasmic when you|hear it. Let's give the telephone a rest.
{104234}{104276}Cheers.
{104280}{104318}Great.
{104322}{104402}You're a fucking diplomat.|This is it. It's going to hell.
{104406}{104438}Fuck her.
{104442}{104502}Who cares? We'll take it|somewhere else.
{104506}{104576}-You hire a lawyer.|-That's how I want to finish.
{104580}{104641}-What, with a lawsuit?|-No. With that song.
{104645}{104715}-Which song?|-The song I just played you.
{104750}{104808}-It's a ballad.|-So what?
{104812}{104880}-You want me to hand them a ballad?|-That's right.
{104884}{104944}You're kidding, right?|Tell me you're kidding.
{104948}{105011}No. I'm not fucking kidding.
{105020}{105102}-Alex was right.|-Alex was right?
{105106}{105214}-The other song doesn't pull you in.|-It pulled me right across the room.
{105378}{105410}I'm serious.
{105414}{105479}-Is this about Alex?|-No.
{105483}{105563}Alex doesn't know about this.|She's into flies and domination.
{105567}{105606}Determinism.
{105610}{105642}-lan.|-Jane.
{105646}{105689}lan!
{105695}{105738}Do you like it?
{105811}{105861}-Jane?|-What?
{105865}{105935}-Did you?|-Yeah.
{105942}{105982}Yeah?
{106004}{106050}I said I did.
{106065}{106150}Well, all right then.|Let's just finish the record, darling.
{106154}{106238}I can't stand to watch Claudia|wank you off any longer.
{106242}{106286}It's starting to make me jealous.
{108538}{108581}Oh, God. Sorry. Excuse me.
{108585}{108646}Sam? Hold on one second.|I'm just gonna--
{108650}{108692}-Hey.|-Hello.
{108696}{108745}Where?
{108749}{108801}No, I can't hear you.
{108891}{108946}There a lot of people there?
{108950}{109043}Yeah. I guess, like, 15, 20 or so.
{109068}{109162}Shrimp cocktail|and something else.
{109166}{109250}No, I didn't see any crab cakes.
{109259}{109359}-Do you want to come up?|-No. I probably won't.
{109363}{109459}No. No, stay.|Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
{109463}{109519}Okay. I will.
{109523}{109580}I promise.
{109680}{109717}Were you trailing me?
{109724}{109773}Maybe.
{109777}{109843}Why didn't you catch up to me?
{109951}{109987}Sara?
{110034}{110107}I was sublimating you.
{110348}{110455}You're not meant to be in a band.|You're meant to work in a bank.
{110459}{110505}And everything else is happening.
{110798}{110875}I'm not usually so aggressive.
{110897}{110971}-I don't believe that.|-I'm not.
{111026}{111068}I just....
{111072}{111145}I don't really know you. I....
{111172}{111231}I just feel connected to you.|I feel....
{111239}{111361}I feel safe with you,|like it's okay to be honest.
{111415}{111485}It's just one of those things.
{111528}{111599}I'm just attracted to you.
{111603}{111729}And it's not just because|I think you're incredibly sexy.
{111876}{112006}I think that you're incredibly|attractive too, Sara. I do.
{112039}{112089}You do?
{112100}{112168}Yeah. I think about you.
{112185}{112233}Trust me.
{112259}{112306}A lot.
{112328}{112400}How do you think about me?
{112430}{112478}How?
{112488}{112532}Yeah.
{112548}{112625}Do you think about|having sex with me?
{112711}{112762}Yeah.
{112766}{112817}How?
{112889}{112966}How do I think about|having sex with you?
{112970}{113002}Yeah.
{113006}{113087}Do you think about me|going down on you?
{113147}{113194}Yeah.
{113228}{113322}-That's part of it.|-Yeah, me too.
{113340}{113409}I think about how you'd taste.

{113569}{113642}-Do you resist me?|-No.
{113646}{113722}-Do you give yourself over?|-Yeah.

{116199}{116263}I mean, you're with someone.
{116297}{116368}Why would I let myself|fall in love with you?
{116390}{116431}What, like...
{116435}{116530}...I'm just an object to you?|I'm just, like, a piece of ass?

{120729}{120817}I think it's the best record|you've done too.
{120832}{120904}I didn't say "the best."
{120913}{121029}-She said the best, didn't she?|-I thought she said "the last."
