1
00:00:02,408 --> 00:00:06,085
Though decadent and corrupt,
weakened by politics and war,

2
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:10,402
the Roman Empire remained
the greatest power on earth.

3
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:13,955
Then a new people, the Huns,
fierce and independent,

4
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:15,866
appeared from the east.

5
00:00:15,907 --> 00:00:20,011
An ancient prophecy told of a man
who would one day unite the tribes

6
00:00:20,046 --> 00:00:23,451
and challenge Rome
for the right to rule the world.

7
00:01:24,896 --> 00:01:27,184
- My arrow fell short!
- Aim higher.

8
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:28,886
The deer outruns it.

9
00:01:28,931 --> 00:01:32,192
Perhaps it's time
you had a stronger bow.

10
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:35,531
We're on Dunnotis' land.

11
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:38,316
The chase was long.
We meant no harm.

12
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:41,100
We'll send him
the antlers as a gift.

13
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,360
Still, we might have been seen.

14
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:46,037
If Dunnotis complains, we kill him.

15
00:01:46,082 --> 00:01:49,238
Hush, boy. It's foolish for Huns
to kill Huns.

16
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:53,839
How can we conquer the western lands
if we fight among our own?

17
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:12,136
Father spoke of the western lands
during the hunt.

18
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:14,951
He was there once,
when he was young.

19
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:16,902
Did he discover them?

20
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:19,787
No, no... Others discovered them
long ago.

21
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:21,738
How?

22
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:25,112
A gadfly.

23
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:30,154
A warrior was taming a stallion,

24
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:33,636
and a gadfly bit the stallion
so hard, it ran away.

25
00:02:33,676 --> 00:02:37,566
The warrior followed
the stallion into the great marsh.

26
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:39,895
But there's no way past the marsh.

27
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:44,244
Oh, the horse found a way,
and the warrior followed the horse,

28
00:02:44,286 --> 00:02:48,449
- and on the other side...
- He found the western lands.

29
00:02:48,496 --> 00:02:50,998
Father says we'll conquer them.

30
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:54,998
- When the Great King comes.
- How will we know when he comes?

31
00:02:55,037 --> 00:02:58,335
The Great King
will kneel to no man,

32
00:02:58,376 --> 00:03:00,879
and all men will kneel to him.

33
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,941
He will rule the Hun as one nation,

34
00:03:03,978 --> 00:03:07,868
and hold the sword of the war god
in his hand.

35
00:03:07,908 --> 00:03:12,321
And...he'll go to bed
when he's told.

36
00:03:12,397 --> 00:03:14,057
Yes, Father.

37
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,422
(Arrow whistles )

38
00:04:11,992 --> 00:04:14,175
No! Attila, stop!

39
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:18,737
- I want to help! Let me help!
- Get under this cart.

40
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:21,445
You stay in there.
Get out of the way.

41
00:05:04,108 --> 00:05:05,495
Father!

42
00:05:08,665 --> 00:05:09,910
Father.

43
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:17,883
Father...

44
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:31,765
Get him!

45
00:05:43,525 --> 00:05:45,601
You are Mundzuk's son.

46
00:05:45,647 --> 00:05:47,415
Where is my grandmother?

47
00:05:47,456 --> 00:05:50,967
She is dead. Your father is dead.

48
00:05:51,004 --> 00:05:54,195
That's his reward
for hunting on our lands.

49
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,265
I am your master now.

50
00:05:57,302 --> 00:05:59,211
Kneel.

51
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:10,132
Kneel!

52
00:06:10,174 --> 00:06:14,480
And I might let you live as my slave.

53
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,449
Hyah! Hyah!

54
00:08:10,513 --> 00:08:12,316
What's your name, boy?

55
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:17,152
Attila, son of Mundzuk.

56
00:08:17,193 --> 00:08:19,624
Don't you recognize me?

57
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:24,111
I am Rua, your father's brother,

58
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:28,077
and it's a long time
since you've seen me.

59
00:08:28,117 --> 00:08:32,529
- My father's dead.
- Yes. Weeks ago.

60
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,895
You've been alone all this time?

61
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,137
You're safe now. Come.

62
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,593
Unless you prefer
living alone on the steppes.

63
00:09:04,472 --> 00:09:06,548
(Indistinct chatter)

64
00:09:20,372 --> 00:09:23,633
(Rua )
What are the three sacred animals?

65
00:09:23,677 --> 00:09:26,179
The wolverine,
because he never retreats,

66
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:28,850
the sheba,
because she protects her young,

67
00:09:28,895 --> 00:09:31,528
and the horse,
because it is sacred to the war god.

68
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:36,473
- How many layers in a bow?
- Two of wood, two of bone.

69
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:43,018
How long must you heat
the bow before you string it?

70
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:45,107
Until the outer layer sweats.

71
00:09:45,142 --> 00:09:47,324
You've been taught well.

72
00:09:48,447 --> 00:09:50,523
Go to your tent.

73
00:09:56,206 --> 00:09:58,637
He doesn't belong here.

74
00:09:58,676 --> 00:10:02,317
I took my brother's wife
and elder son.

75
00:10:02,364 --> 00:10:06,148
Should I leave the younger
to die on the steppe?

76
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,578
Yes.

77
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:09,727
Yes, for Bleda's sake.

78
00:10:09,774 --> 00:10:12,312
He's the elder.

79
00:10:12,348 --> 00:10:16,417
He'll get the larger portion
when I die.

80
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:21,103
There will be trouble between them.
I can see it already.

81
00:10:33,535 --> 00:10:35,647
Who's there?

82
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,606
Who are you?

83
00:10:46,686 --> 00:10:49,984
- Who are you?
- Attila.

84
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:53,810
- I am Galen.
- What are you?

85
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:57,363
- A girl. Are you blind?
- You look like an old woman.

86
00:10:57,402 --> 00:11:00,841
- I'm no older than you.
- Why aren't you with the others?

87
00:11:01,924 --> 00:11:04,000
They're afraid of me.

88
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:05,956
Why are they afraid of you?

89
00:11:05,994 --> 00:11:10,027
Because I read the stars and the sky
and the sun and the moon.

90
00:11:10,065 --> 00:11:11,618
You're a witch.

91
00:11:11,665 --> 00:11:16,457
I had a vision yesterday
that he would be born.

92
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:18,826
- Who?
- The Great King.

93
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:21,749
Stay back.
I was born ten years ago.

94
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:23,213
No.

95
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,936
You were born yesterday,
on the steppes.

96
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:31,451
Ah, yes.

97
00:11:31,496 --> 00:11:34,413
Yesterday, on the steppes.

98
00:11:40,054 --> 00:11:43,173
(Rua ) Some say it takes months
to make a bow.

99
00:11:44,263 --> 00:11:47,667
But...it takes 15 years.

100
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:51,040
It starts when the tree
is first planted.

101
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:56,052
You cut the wood too soon,
the bow lacks strength,

102
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:58,203
too late, it becomes brittle.

103
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:01,618
King Rua... We found them.

104
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,248
Are these the men
that attacked your camp?

105
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,753
(Rua ) They're yours.

106
00:12:20,793 --> 00:12:23,604
You do with them what you will.

107
00:12:25,803 --> 00:12:29,930
- There were more of them.
- They were killed. These remain.

108
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:38,352
- Kneel.
- Kneel to a boy?

109
00:12:38,397 --> 00:12:40,579
Submit to me and live.

110
00:13:41,123 --> 00:13:45,536
Attila!
Have you spoken to the scouts?

111
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:49,016
They saw no force of any kind
between us and the river.

112
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,750
Good.

113
00:14:10,487 --> 00:14:12,740
IMPERIAL PRISON
ROME

114
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:25,643
You should be used to it by now.

115
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,801
We guards eat the same food.

116
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:30,384
It's slave food.

117
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:33,612
Only a slave could get used to it.

118
00:14:52,617 --> 00:14:54,599
Aaargh!

119
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:09,834
I am Flavius Aetius.

120
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,653
Rome endures.

121
00:15:15,718 --> 00:15:17,794
I will endure.

122
00:15:21,841 --> 00:15:24,581
(Man ) Parthians, Scythians,

123
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:29,381
Macedonians, Picts, Gauls, Britons,
Angles, Franks, Jews, Egyptians.

124
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:32,023
The list of defeated peoples
is endless.

125
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:35,674
- Why are Huns different?
- They simply are, Majesty.

126
00:15:35,722 --> 00:15:40,728
- Wait till they face Roman troops.
- They've defeated us before.

127
00:15:40,766 --> 00:15:44,100
From the Eastern Empire.
We're made of different stuff.

128
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:48,305
- We have no troops near the border.
- Send them from somewhere else.

129
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:51,470
Not possible.
We're overextended as it is.

130
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:57,663
Is it serious? The Huns
have been a nuisance for decades.

131
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:02,229
- They've crossed into our territory.
- They're isolated raids.

132
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:07,379
And when they realize how little
resistance we can offer, what then?

133
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,137
Placidia, one man
might be able to deal with them.

134
00:16:12,182 --> 00:16:14,293
Aetius will not leave prison alive.

135
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,972
He knows their customs,
knows their king.

136
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,927
I said no.

137
00:16:18,966 --> 00:16:21,433
(Emperor groaning)

138
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:23,938
Felix, I know my son is...

139
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,236
immature, but he is learning.

140
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:29,357
He's emperor now,

141
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:33,922
and he'll rise to the occasion
as other emperors have before him.

142
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:38,333
There! I did it!

143
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:43,729
What shall I hit?
That vase sitting on the pedestal?

144
00:16:49,651 --> 00:16:51,489
Idiot!

145
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,032
He's ruined my shot!

146
00:16:55,286 --> 00:16:57,433
I'll think about what you said,

147
00:16:57,479 --> 00:17:01,607
but I have to be convinced that
the Huns are a serious threat.

148
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,457
(All yelling)

149
00:17:10,386 --> 00:17:13,162
(Woman ) Invaders! Invaders!

150
00:19:09,611 --> 00:19:11,271
(Screaming)

151
00:20:08,755 --> 00:20:10,593
(Baby crying)

152
00:20:15,086 --> 00:20:18,111
(Man ) Go! Get moving!

153
00:20:34,812 --> 00:20:37,279
Wait! Your name?

154
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:41,731
N'Kara.

155
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:45,554
You fight bravely.

156
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,450
Put her with the slaves.

157
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:55,226
Her sword was the bloodiest of all.

158
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,996
If she has kin, spare them as well.

159
00:21:33,504 --> 00:21:35,580
(Keys rattling)

160
00:21:38,826 --> 00:21:40,736
You may leave.

161
00:21:46,828 --> 00:21:50,505
I once swore you'd never
leave this prison alive,

162
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,812
but your friends have
begged me to be merciful.

163
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:55,931
In the light of their plea...

164
00:21:55,978 --> 00:22:01,185
(Laughs ) There's only one conceivable
reason for you to be here.

165
00:22:01,231 --> 00:22:04,422
- You need me.
- Why would I need you?

166
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:07,764
If I had to guess,
I'd say the Huns are on the move,

167
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:11,412
and you and the rest of Rome
are petrified with fear.

168
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:15,213
There have been reports
of a new warlord...

169
00:22:16,296 --> 00:22:19,901
among the southern tribes - Attila.
Do you know him?

170
00:22:19,948 --> 00:22:23,732
No, but I know King Rua,
and that's what matters.

171
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:28,153
My son is young. He needs someone
to guide his decisions.

172
00:22:28,193 --> 00:22:32,155
You can serve your country
instead of your own ambitions,

173
00:22:32,194 --> 00:22:35,669
- if that's possible.
- Anything's possible.

174
00:22:36,717 --> 00:22:38,520
What's your price?

175
00:22:38,561 --> 00:22:40,778
First, a full pardon.

176
00:22:40,822 --> 00:22:45,863
You tried to depose me, before
my son became of age. That's treason.

177
00:22:45,902 --> 00:22:48,227
Let's call that a misunderstanding.

178
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:55,982
What else?

179
00:22:57,069 --> 00:22:59,357
Full restoration of my estates,

180
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,973
personal staff, hand-picked by me,

181
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,563
and...

182
00:23:05,662 --> 00:23:09,446
reinstatement to the rank
of master of both services.

183
00:23:10,498 --> 00:23:14,353
If I am to deal with the Huns,
I must have the supreme command.

184
00:23:14,395 --> 00:23:17,585
- Felix has the supreme command.
- Remove him.

185
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,034
- He recommended your release.
- I'll thank him.

186
00:23:21,074 --> 00:23:25,001
- You can rot in this cell forever.
- And you?

187
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,065
You can find someone else
to deal with the Huns.

188
00:23:31,755 --> 00:23:33,487
Warden.

189
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,749
Release him.

190
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:47,990
He is your new supreme commander.

191
00:24:05,953 --> 00:24:09,322
The guard who brought me
my food, what's his name?

192
00:24:09,363 --> 00:24:11,439
Petronius, my lord.

193
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:29,084
- Father!
- Lydia.

194
00:24:30,132 --> 00:24:33,228
Oh, you're really free!

195
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,340
Oh, I was afraid to believe it.

196
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:39,064
I came to the prison
but they wouldn't let me see you.

197
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:42,928
My God, look at you.

198
00:24:43,979 --> 00:24:48,250
You're a young woman,
and a lovely one at that.

199
00:24:52,816 --> 00:24:54,962
The villa's really ours again?

200
00:24:55,947 --> 00:24:57,607
Yes.

201
00:24:57,651 --> 00:25:00,392
And the one in Sicily too.

202
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:04,080
Tomorrow I'll bring in workers.

203
00:25:05,688 --> 00:25:08,428
It'll be as beautiful as ever.

204
00:25:12,263 --> 00:25:16,890
(Galen ) Come on, move!
You wretches, move!

205
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:21,481
Ha, ha, you're in my lot now!

206
00:25:27,258 --> 00:25:29,025
(Attila ) King Rua,

207
00:25:29,067 --> 00:25:31,842
I bring you tribute from our victory.

208
00:25:33,173 --> 00:25:37,621
(Scoffs ) A victory over farmers?

209
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:42,179
The people are watching.

210
00:25:42,218 --> 00:25:46,524
You are brothers!
Embrace like brothers.

211
00:26:00,343 --> 00:26:05,622
Let us see the treasures
that Attila has brought us!

212
00:26:11,685 --> 00:26:15,054
Attila, don't let your brother's
envy spoil your victory.

213
00:26:15,095 --> 00:26:17,562
(Attila ) He's right.

214
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:21,312
It was a village defended
by peasants and farmers.

215
00:26:21,357 --> 00:26:25,247
We fight peasants
because no one else dare fight us!

216
00:26:25,288 --> 00:26:27,340
Yes. Not even the Romans.

217
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:32,346
- Rome? That's a different matter.
- We are Huns. We fear no one.

218
00:26:32,385 --> 00:26:33,974
True.

219
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,910
But, uh, why wake a sleeping lion?

220
00:26:40,317 --> 00:26:44,385
We were 50 leagues
into their territory.

221
00:26:44,423 --> 00:26:47,827
There were no legions,
no soldiers. Not one.

222
00:26:49,954 --> 00:26:54,260
Let me take a larger army
and go further.

223
00:26:54,303 --> 00:26:57,944
- How much further?
- To Rome itself.

224
00:26:59,486 --> 00:27:03,685
What will you do when you get there?
Scratch against the walls?

225
00:27:03,731 --> 00:27:05,807
They're wide as wagons,

226
00:27:05,853 --> 00:27:08,557
but they're made of stone,
not of wood!

227
00:27:25,788 --> 00:27:27,283
(Roars )

228
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:30,580
I scared you.
Galen scared the great Attila.

229
00:27:30,624 --> 00:27:34,444
- I could have killed you.
- What did you bring Galen?

230
00:27:34,485 --> 00:27:37,439
- Nothing.
- Attila always brings something.

231
00:27:37,478 --> 00:27:40,110
- You did, didn't you?
- Maybe.

232
00:27:40,156 --> 00:27:43,561
Did you have another vision
while I was gone?

233
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,250
- Maybe. What did you bring me?
- And no more about the god of war?

234
00:27:48,297 --> 00:27:52,295
That vision has been in our tribe
since we crossed the great marsh.

235
00:27:52,332 --> 00:27:56,010
After a hard battle,
the war god fell asleep.

236
00:27:56,056 --> 00:27:58,238
His sword dropped from his hand.

237
00:27:58,282 --> 00:28:00,879
Whoever finds it will rule the world.

238
00:28:00,926 --> 00:28:03,287
You must believe it, Attila.

239
00:28:03,326 --> 00:28:04,915
Why?

240
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:08,745
Because when you're
in my visions, so is the sword.

241
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:12,193
A handle of gold and ivory,
crowned with rubies.

242
00:28:13,451 --> 00:28:15,526
I won't even rule the tribe.

243
00:28:15,572 --> 00:28:19,285
When my uncle dies,
Bleda will be king.

244
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:23,149
Bleda's not in my visions. You are.

245
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:29,488
Go away, woman!

246
00:28:29,523 --> 00:28:31,848
Leave me alone.

247
00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:34,249
To think of the red-haired woman.

248
00:28:35,751 --> 00:28:37,625
The whole tribe knows.

249
00:28:37,664 --> 00:28:40,890
A red-haired woman
has caught Attila's eye.

250
00:28:40,935 --> 00:28:43,402
A red-haired woman has caught...

251
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,471
(Yells)

252
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:01,832
Tonight we celebrate
the victory of Attila,

253
00:29:01,878 --> 00:29:05,519
the first with Roman spoils.

254
00:29:05,566 --> 00:29:07,369
(All cheer)

255
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:13,009
Bleda, as the eldest,
you take precedence, however.

256
00:29:14,124 --> 00:29:16,200
Choose wisely.

257
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:23,752
Attila, your raid
has brought us many riches,

258
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:26,334
and I commend you.

259
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,208
Since I did not fight,

260
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:30,918
I claim nothing of value.

261
00:29:32,111 --> 00:29:34,163
Only...

262
00:29:34,198 --> 00:29:37,804
an animal, unknown in these parts.

263
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:46,510
A strange creature
with piercing eyes and red fur.

264
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:48,280
(Crowd laughing)

265
00:29:50,932 --> 00:29:52,841
Bring it in.

266
00:30:05,962 --> 00:30:10,125
Later tonight,
I may start my own race.

267
00:30:10,171 --> 00:30:13,575
Huns with red hair.

268
00:30:13,615 --> 00:30:15,667
(Crowd laughing)

269
00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:42,276
Attila, what are you doing?

270
00:30:42,317 --> 00:30:45,722
You can't kill Bleda. You can't!

271
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:48,923
Not in Rua's tent,

272
00:30:48,962 --> 00:30:51,667
but when he comes out,
I will be waiting.

273
00:30:51,711 --> 00:30:53,964
No. Your time has not yet come.

274
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:56,996
This morning I had another vision.

275
00:30:57,033 --> 00:31:00,782
Destiny has chosen you,
but only if you bide your time.

276
00:31:03,922 --> 00:31:06,034
I'm tired of your visions!

277
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:10,801
No! I won't let you.

278
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:13,867
(Groans )

279
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:20,930
A woman.

280
00:31:20,969 --> 00:31:24,029
Hey, Galen.

281
00:31:25,213 --> 00:31:29,317
If you fight with Bleda over a woman,
the tribe will turn its back on you.

282
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,536
Even if you win, you lose.

283
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,470
Go back to Rua's tent,
claim your share of the spoils,

284
00:31:35,512 --> 00:31:37,872
claim the conquered village.

285
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:41,874
- Am I a farmer, that I need land?
- Claim the village.

286
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:43,989
It was in my vision.

287
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,056
Next!

288
00:31:57,324 --> 00:31:59,400
The horse shied.

289
00:32:00,282 --> 00:32:02,500
You and your horse are one.

290
00:32:02,543 --> 00:32:04,654
His mistake is your mistake.

291
00:32:51,424 --> 00:32:52,918
(Yells)

292
00:33:08,227 --> 00:33:10,694
The beast with red fur.

293
00:33:12,332 --> 00:33:14,408
The toadstool who talks.

294
00:33:14,454 --> 00:33:17,479
Bleda mounts you
more often than he does his horse.

295
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:21,027
It is no choice of mine.
I'd sooner die than bed a Hun.

296
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,116
Then why don't you?

297
00:33:24,891 --> 00:33:26,967
My sister and mother.

298
00:33:27,014 --> 00:33:29,719
If I kill myself,
Bleda will kill them.

299
00:33:29,762 --> 00:33:31,707
They live because of Attila.

300
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:37,619
I've seen the way he looks at you,
and the way you look at him.

301
00:33:40,095 --> 00:33:42,171
I belong to Bleda.

302
00:33:42,217 --> 00:33:46,107
A Hun doesn't possess a woman
until she bears his child.

303
00:33:47,714 --> 00:33:52,305
If you bear Bleda's,
Attila won't want you.

304
00:33:54,637 --> 00:33:56,475
And how can I help it?

305
00:33:58,672 --> 00:34:02,943
These seeds.
Swallow one every day.

306
00:34:02,987 --> 00:34:05,904
They will keep
little Bledas out of your womb.

307
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,219
Attila or Bleda?

308
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,831
Bleda or Attila?

309
00:34:14,676 --> 00:34:17,487
I know who Galen would choose.

310
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,750
We don't even know
if the Huns will attack again.

311
00:34:35,794 --> 00:34:37,775
Trust me, they will.

312
00:34:37,812 --> 00:34:40,100
I lived among them when I was young.

313
00:34:40,142 --> 00:34:42,016
How did that happen?

314
00:34:42,056 --> 00:34:44,903
There was a treaty,
an exchange of hostages.

315
00:34:44,943 --> 00:34:48,004
They are brave, strong,
and far from stupid.

316
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,761
Is it true their women
walk around naked?

317
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:59,546
They crossed the border
here above Cologne.

318
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,357
They sacked 20 villages.

319
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:04,459
As I told Felix, we should
send troops to punish them.

320
00:35:04,495 --> 00:35:06,998
And as he told you,
we have none to send.

321
00:35:07,035 --> 00:35:11,554
If we pull legions from the west,
the Goths will pillage us instead.

322
00:35:11,593 --> 00:35:14,262
The Huns have violated
our territory,

323
00:35:14,306 --> 00:35:17,081
and therefore
insulted my divine person.

324
00:35:17,124 --> 00:35:18,998
The insult must be avenged.

325
00:35:19,037 --> 00:35:23,664
It was the Huns that drove the Goths
against us in the first place.

326
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:25,537
And split the empire.

327
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:29,326
That's why I rule the West
and Theodosius the East. I know.

328
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:32,324
Yet your divine brain
does not grasp the point.

329
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:37,013
What we must avoid at all costs is
fighting the Huns and Goths at once.

330
00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:39,312
(Girl giggling)

331
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,495
Mmm!

332
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:51,730
Traitor. I'm your sister.
You're supposed to help me.

333
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,648
You wanted to be kissed.

334
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:58,692
Flavius Aetius.

335
00:36:00,855 --> 00:36:02,931
The divine Honoria.

336
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:05,824
I hope you're
behaving yourself, Aetius.

337
00:36:05,865 --> 00:36:09,993
If you don't, Mummy said
she'll throw you right back in jail.

338
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,700
Forever.

339
00:36:11,745 --> 00:36:13,726
Mummy will have her joke.

340
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:19,984
- Shall we continue, divine one?
- We're going to the Forum.

341
00:36:20,025 --> 00:36:22,598
Pritella's daughters
will be there.

342
00:36:23,713 --> 00:36:25,480
We'll finish later.

343
00:36:25,522 --> 00:36:29,412
I have to talk with Mummy, anyway.
Later, Aetius.

344
00:36:29,452 --> 00:36:32,263
I...command it.

345
00:36:32,306 --> 00:36:34,038
(Honoria giggles )

346
00:36:34,949 --> 00:36:36,823
Goodbye, Mummy.

347
00:36:40,308 --> 00:36:42,252
Where is my son going?

348
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:44,473
To the Forum.

349
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:47,707
He needs rest
from his intellectual labors.

350
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:50,777
- But he is progressing?
- No.

351
00:36:50,814 --> 00:36:55,333
Nevertheless, whatever steps
you take, you will take through him.

352
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,977
After he obtains your approval.

353
00:37:02,747 --> 00:37:05,178
Some things need immediate attention.

354
00:37:05,217 --> 00:37:08,063
Training of troops,
stockpiling of supplies.

355
00:37:08,105 --> 00:37:10,181
See to that on your own.

356
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:12,765
- It would help if I had your seal.
- Why?

357
00:37:12,801 --> 00:37:16,478
Three years in prison
have destroyed my reputation.

358
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:19,194
I need proof
that I act on your behalf.

359
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,437
The Huns are at our border, Placidia.

360
00:37:23,482 --> 00:37:27,123
We must both forget old hatreds.

361
00:37:35,902 --> 00:37:38,014
(Aetius ) Petronius...

362
00:37:40,355 --> 00:37:43,653
Don't worry.
If I wanted you dead, you would be.

363
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:46,850
(Petronius ) I beg you,
forgive my foolishness.

364
00:37:46,896 --> 00:37:48,948
I was not well in the head.

365
00:37:50,688 --> 00:37:52,906
How does your head feel now?

366
00:37:52,949 --> 00:37:56,247
Ready for whatever service
you require, my lord.

367
00:37:56,289 --> 00:37:58,306
Good.

368
00:37:58,377 --> 00:38:01,009
I require you to kill someone.

369
00:38:01,055 --> 00:38:02,787
Who is it, my lord?

370
00:38:08,361 --> 00:38:10,270
The Emperor Valentinian.

371
00:38:11,735 --> 00:38:15,484
It's all arranged. You'll be gone
before anyone knows.

372
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,647
Ten gold talents now,
ten after it's done.

373
00:38:21,721 --> 00:38:23,381
A fortune.

374
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:27,459
- I'll be a hunted man forever.
- No, no, no.

375
00:38:27,496 --> 00:38:30,936
The Emperor's mother herself
will protect you.

376
00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:34,450
She's tasted power.
She doesn't want to give it up.

377
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,221
Her seal.

378
00:38:40,264 --> 00:38:44,914
She gave it to me for this purpose.
Keep it with you.

379
00:38:44,961 --> 00:38:48,222
If you're taken,
it'll be your protection.

380
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:57,170
Tomorrow noon, the Garden of Corona.

381
00:38:57,207 --> 00:38:59,532
Use the south gate.

382
00:38:59,573 --> 00:39:01,898
I'll see that he's alone.

383
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:26,601
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

384
00:39:30,848 --> 00:39:32,900
Halt.

385
00:39:39,198 --> 00:39:42,317
How dare you raise a weapon
against the Emperor!

386
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:50,668
I was walking by.
Thought he looked out of place.

387
00:39:50,714 --> 00:39:54,355
Thank God I followed him!
What are you doing here?

388
00:39:54,402 --> 00:39:58,043
I had an invitation from Mummy
to have a picnic.

389
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,003
See if you can find out who he is.

390
00:40:16,702 --> 00:40:18,814
He carries my mother's seal.

391
00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:21,528
How is that possible?

392
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:28,594
She invited me here...to be killed.

393
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,686
No. Your own mother?

394
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:32,833
I should have known!

395
00:40:34,167 --> 00:40:39,173
All this talk
of teaching me to be emperor

396
00:40:39,211 --> 00:40:41,572
was just to keep me off guard!

397
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,018
I'll have that bitch boiled alive.

398
00:40:46,065 --> 00:40:48,532
No, no, no. Sire.

399
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:51,036
- You have no proof.
- Her seal!

400
00:40:51,075 --> 00:40:54,716
She'll say it was stolen
or she loaned it someone.

401
00:40:54,763 --> 00:40:58,866
She'll have an explanation.
Trust me. I know how she works.

402
00:40:58,902 --> 00:41:00,526
Yes.

403
00:41:00,572 --> 00:41:03,870
You've been
her victim too, haven't you?

404
00:41:03,912 --> 00:41:08,360
- All those years in prison.
- I am not important.

405
00:41:09,653 --> 00:41:13,294
Rome is, and you are Rome.

406
00:41:15,044 --> 00:41:16,918
Act wisely.

407
00:41:18,002 --> 00:41:22,865
- What must I do?
- For now, nothing.

408
00:41:22,907 --> 00:41:28,399
When she finds out her scheme
has failed, she'll lay low.

409
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:33,587
We'll take care of her
when the time is right.

410
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:43,359
I put myself in your hands.

411
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:53,379
Attila, walk with Galen
in the woods.

412
00:41:53,418 --> 00:41:55,043
I'm tired.

413
00:41:55,088 --> 00:41:58,598
A short walk with your friend.
You won't regret it.

414
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,293
(Attila ) Woman...

415
00:42:06,047 --> 00:42:07,744
Where are you?

416
00:42:45,569 --> 00:42:47,229
Don't be afraid.

417
00:42:48,352 --> 00:42:50,261
I'm not afraid.

418
00:43:03,903 --> 00:43:05,979
Go back.

419
00:43:06,025 --> 00:43:09,465
If my brother misses you,
you'll be punished.

420
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:11,616
I don't care.

421
00:43:13,192 --> 00:43:14,687
Go back.

422
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:29,640
(Aetius ) Valentinian,
tell me what Rome is.

423
00:43:29,682 --> 00:43:31,864
A great city, a great country.

424
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:35,630
Rome is a fire...

425
00:43:36,919 --> 00:43:39,386
a golden flame of power,

426
00:43:39,424 --> 00:43:43,587
of majesty, beauty, knowledge.

427
00:43:43,633 --> 00:43:47,488
For a thousand years,
she has been the light of the world.

428
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,404
Go outside.

429
00:43:49,444 --> 00:43:51,388
Look around you.

430
00:43:53,270 --> 00:44:00,151
The Colosseum, the Senate,
Forum, theaters, markets, aqueducts,

431
00:44:00,193 --> 00:44:02,269
that bring water from 100 miles away

432
00:44:02,315 --> 00:44:05,340
so we can live like civilized
men instead of animals.

433
00:44:05,378 --> 00:44:11,427
Of course, you're saying
that Rome is rich,

434
00:44:11,466 --> 00:44:14,063
and we have to keep it that way.

435
00:44:16,232 --> 00:44:18,308
That's right.

436
00:44:18,353 --> 00:44:23,324
Tomorrow, I'll go to Ravenna and
take command of the Third Legion.

437
00:44:23,363 --> 00:44:25,961
It's two weeks' march
to the Hun border.

438
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:28,331
I'll need Senate approval tonight.

439
00:44:28,373 --> 00:44:32,300
- Tonight? They're all asleep.
- You are the emperor.

440
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,487
Wake them up.

441
00:44:35,784 --> 00:44:37,278
Yes!

442
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:40,540
I will enjoy that.

443
00:44:40,585 --> 00:44:43,681
Darling, I haven't seen you all day.

444
00:44:43,716 --> 00:44:45,590
Valentinian?

445
00:44:46,743 --> 00:44:51,191
Thank you. It's proved very useful.
I'm finished with it now.

446
00:45:00,346 --> 00:45:03,015
Attila, you still want to go to Rome?

447
00:45:04,103 --> 00:45:06,179
If you're serious, yes.

448
00:45:06,225 --> 00:45:11,017
I'm serious. Then again, perhaps you
won't need to go to Rome after all.

449
00:45:11,095 --> 00:45:13,421
I received a message.

450
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:18,396
It seems that Rome
is coming here, tomorrow.

451
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:54,682
We know of your incursion
into our territory.

452
00:45:54,722 --> 00:45:59,728
Officially, I protest.
But that's not my true purpose.

453
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:03,930
Our spies bring word that
the Goths plan to move against us.

454
00:46:03,977 --> 00:46:08,354
- Which tribe?
- The Visigoths west of the Rhine.

455
00:46:09,474 --> 00:46:12,250
Why not march your legion there?

456
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:16,941
For your sake, Rua,
and the sake of our friendship.

457
00:46:16,988 --> 00:46:21,223
Our spies tell us the Visigoths
plan to move against you as well.

458
00:46:21,267 --> 00:46:25,466
They've been paying tribute
to us for, uh...

459
00:46:25,512 --> 00:46:27,979
- Ten years.
- Ten years.

460
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:30,648
(Aetius ) And they hate you for it.

461
00:46:30,695 --> 00:46:35,843
Just as they hate us. They'll attack
you first to secure their rear,

462
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:40,600
then us while we sit here
quibbling over a few border villages.

463
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:57,967
He is of your tribe?

464
00:46:58,006 --> 00:47:00,710
The Visigoths tortured him.

465
00:47:00,754 --> 00:47:02,379
My spies saw it.

466
00:47:03,641 --> 00:47:07,116
Knowing the horse
is sacred to the Hun,

467
00:47:08,965 --> 00:47:12,334
they carved ten horses into his body
with heated knives,

468
00:47:12,373 --> 00:47:14,485
one for each year of tribute.

469
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:16,583
It took him three days to die!

470
00:47:18,427 --> 00:47:21,452
(Attila ) There should be more blood.

471
00:47:21,489 --> 00:47:27,362
These wounds were made after death.
Perhaps not by the Visigoths.

472
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:37,276
A Roman general has better things
to do than mutilate corpses.

473
00:47:42,154 --> 00:47:44,230
You've grown soft.

474
00:47:46,747 --> 00:47:51,646
The Huns I knew
would avenge such an insult.

475
00:47:51,687 --> 00:47:54,604
I came to offer an alliance.

476
00:47:54,644 --> 00:47:58,190
I'll march
against the Visigoths alone.

477
00:47:59,688 --> 00:48:00,933
Flavius!

478
00:48:03,793 --> 00:48:09,392
We, uh, divide the spoils equally?

479
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:10,889
Of course.

480
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:13,844
We'll join you.

481
00:48:13,883 --> 00:48:15,686
(Men laugh)

482
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:18,359
Make preparations, now!

483
00:48:33,574 --> 00:48:36,349
Who was the outspoken one?

484
00:48:36,392 --> 00:48:39,417
My nephew, Attila.

485
00:48:39,453 --> 00:48:43,273
Attila? I've heard of him.

486
00:48:43,315 --> 00:48:46,233
Yes. He's very ambitious.

487
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:50,576
Why, the other day,
he spoke of invading Rome.

488
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:52,602
Did he?

489
00:48:53,683 --> 00:48:57,609
I raised him and his brother
since they were children.

490
00:48:57,649 --> 00:49:00,246
They hated each other
from the first.

491
00:49:00,293 --> 00:49:04,255
There is the source
of their latest conflict.

492
00:49:04,294 --> 00:49:06,796
(Aetius ) A slave girl?

493
00:49:06,834 --> 00:49:09,989
(Rua ) Bleda claimed her
just to spite Attila.

494
00:49:11,634 --> 00:49:16,355
If they don't fight over her,
they'll find some other reason.

495
00:49:17,445 --> 00:49:20,540
Why not put Attila under my command?

496
00:49:20,576 --> 00:49:23,316
You'd have peace for a time,
at any rate.

497
00:49:38,457 --> 00:49:42,004
They march well, but can they fight?

498
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:45,719
I sense you'd rather fight
against us than with us.

499
00:49:46,842 --> 00:49:50,839
I've seen much Roman arrogance
but little Roman power.

500
00:49:54,426 --> 00:49:58,732
(Man ) Sentries are set, General. The
enemy is a league west of the Rhine.

501
00:49:58,775 --> 00:50:02,701
(Aetius ) Wake the camp
after the third watch, quietly.

502
00:50:02,741 --> 00:50:04,994
We'll occupy the rise at dawn.

503
00:50:05,037 --> 00:50:09,070
- The Huns will cut off any retreat.
- Yes, General.

504
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:24,024
The dead man in Rua's tent...

505
00:50:25,146 --> 00:50:28,621
The Visigoths
had nothing to do with it.

506
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:31,755
And you handled it very badly.

507
00:50:31,791 --> 00:50:34,187
You should have waited
till I was gone,

508
00:50:34,226 --> 00:50:36,338
and you should have seemed puzzled.

509
00:50:36,384 --> 00:50:40,690
"If he were tortured while alive,
why isn't there more blood?"

510
00:50:40,731 --> 00:50:45,879
Rua realizes the answer for himself
and is more likely to believe it.

511
00:50:45,916 --> 00:50:48,347
Trickery and deceit...

512
00:50:49,395 --> 00:50:52,170
That's the way of the Romans,
not of the Huns.

513
00:50:52,248 --> 00:50:55,165
Which way rules the world?

514
00:51:29,612 --> 00:51:33,218
A Frankish tribe must have
joined the Visigoths overnight.

515
00:51:33,265 --> 00:51:35,732
- We've just seen their standards.
- How many?

516
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:37,822
Their numbers have doubled.

517
00:51:50,799 --> 00:51:53,717
- Everything is ready?
- Yes, Father.

518
00:51:53,756 --> 00:51:56,425
- They have the high ground.
- Yes.

519
00:51:56,470 --> 00:52:00,076
But have they realized yet
what they're up against?

520
00:52:17,587 --> 00:52:22,273
At the first trumpet, the center
falls back, feigns a retreat.

521
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,821
The second, they turn and fight.

522
00:52:24,859 --> 00:52:29,414
The third,
the Huns attack the enemy flank.

523
00:52:29,451 --> 00:52:31,527
Yes, General.

524
00:52:37,001 --> 00:52:41,128
Take the message to Attila.
He attacks at the third trumpet.

525
00:52:41,175 --> 00:52:43,084
Yes, General.

526
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,081
Prepare for the charge.

527
00:52:51,194 --> 00:52:54,112
(All shouting)

528
00:54:12,986 --> 00:54:15,488
Sound the first trumpet.

529
00:54:15,526 --> 00:54:18,266
(Trumpets blaring)

530
00:54:22,832 --> 00:54:24,634
They're retreating.

531
00:54:25,824 --> 00:54:27,900
Roman cowards.

532
00:54:28,641 --> 00:54:32,390
No. It's a trick.

533
00:54:36,957 --> 00:54:39,032
Sound the second trumpet.

534
00:54:39,078 --> 00:54:41,545
(Trumpets blaring)

535
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:47,425
(All yelling)

536
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:55,037
The courier was killed.

537
00:54:55,082 --> 00:54:58,202
- His body was found a furlong away.
- Send another.

538
00:54:58,249 --> 00:55:00,645
I did. But he
won't get there in time.

539
00:55:06,807 --> 00:55:09,796
He'll expect us to attack the flank.

540
00:55:12,164 --> 00:55:13,896
He sent no orders.

541
00:55:13,939 --> 00:55:15,991
Attack on my signal.

542
00:55:22,462 --> 00:55:23,992
Go! Go!

543
00:55:24,897 --> 00:55:27,602
(All yelling)

544
00:56:17,883 --> 00:56:22,710
With a few more like him, Rome could
conquer the world all over again.

545
00:56:41,992 --> 00:56:44,068
Theodoric.

546
00:56:44,114 --> 00:56:46,226
It's been a long time,
Flavius Aetius.

547
00:56:46,271 --> 00:56:48,703
But the same result -
a Roman victory.

548
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:53,534
- Your terms?
- A third of your men sold as slaves,

549
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:58,096
2,000lbs of gold,
one half your fall harvest.

550
00:56:58,135 --> 00:57:00,009
Do you mean to starve us?

551
00:57:00,048 --> 00:57:02,966
Would you prefer my legions
burn the entire harvest?

552
00:57:03,005 --> 00:57:06,374
You would never dare
without the Huns at your back.

553
00:57:06,415 --> 00:57:10,305
Do you accept the terms,
or shall hostilities continue?

554
00:57:12,051 --> 00:57:13,925
I accept the terms.

555
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:19,180
Aetius. The girl is well?

556
00:57:19,217 --> 00:57:21,471
I told you before.

557
00:57:21,513 --> 00:57:25,890
Lydia is no concern
of yours and never will be.

558
00:57:31,012 --> 00:57:33,479
You knew each other from before?

559
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:35,592
Theodoric?

560
00:57:37,483 --> 00:57:39,559
Yes, our paths have crossed.

561
00:57:39,605 --> 00:57:41,265
(Muttering)

562
00:57:41,309 --> 00:57:43,421
You hate each other.

563
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:48,472
Strange as it may seem, we
were once married to the same woman.

564
00:57:48,511 --> 00:57:50,764
She died years ago. He blames me.

565
00:57:54,112 --> 00:57:59,806
So this fight was for Rome...
and to settle a grudge of your own.

566
00:57:59,853 --> 00:58:01,929
I strive for efficiency.

567
00:58:02,949 --> 00:58:07,575
You Romans play with kings and
nations as a child plays with toys.

568
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:09,686
(Aetius chuckles )

569
00:58:14,151 --> 00:58:16,404
I go back to Rome soon.

570
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:18,392
Come with me.

571
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:21,170
Learn how the world is ruled.

572
00:58:21,214 --> 00:58:25,805
See if Rome really does play with
nations as though they were toys.

573
00:58:26,989 --> 00:58:32,066
There's no one like you in Rome
and no one like me here.

574
00:58:32,103 --> 00:58:34,178
Today was just the beginning.

575
00:58:35,234 --> 00:58:38,947
We could do great things
together, you and I.

576
00:58:40,731 --> 00:58:43,019
If we don't kill each other first.

577
00:58:47,619 --> 00:58:50,917
What do you say, Attila?
Will you come?

578
00:59:02,684 --> 00:59:04,736
(Crowd cheering)

579
01:01:02,153 --> 01:01:05,663
Aetius, we congratulate you
on a great victory.

580
01:01:05,701 --> 01:01:08,203
The glory is yours, Caesar.

581
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:10,150
I present Attila,

582
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:14,496
whose courage and skill contributed
greatly to our conquest.

583
01:01:14,538 --> 01:01:18,665
Attila, we welcome you
as an ally and a friend.

584
01:01:18,712 --> 01:01:21,832
Let me introduce you
to some of our leading statesmen.

585
01:01:25,775 --> 01:01:28,064
Gentlemen, this is Attila.

586
01:01:28,106 --> 01:01:31,225
He's quite striking,
in a primitive way.

587
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:34,190
His clothes are made of animal skins.

588
01:01:34,229 --> 01:01:36,803
He'll have them off soon enough.

589
01:01:36,838 --> 01:01:39,614
Was it wise to bring him here?

590
01:01:39,656 --> 01:01:43,405
(Aetius ) One day he'll be king
of the Huns' most powerful tribe.

591
01:01:43,448 --> 01:01:45,524
Then we should kill him.

592
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:49,769
Then we'd be at war with the Huns,
just what we're trying to avoid.

593
01:01:49,815 --> 01:01:54,298
- Won't his elder brother be king?
- Attila will be king.

594
01:01:54,338 --> 01:01:59,379
Therefore, we'll seduce him with
wealth and treat him as a friend.

595
01:02:00,461 --> 01:02:03,450
And at the end
of all your scheming,

596
01:02:03,487 --> 01:02:06,334
- if he turns against us...
- He will not.

597
01:02:06,376 --> 01:02:10,503
It will be on your head, Aetius.

598
01:02:47,567 --> 01:02:51,172
Grachia, congratulations
on your latest victory.

599
01:02:51,219 --> 01:02:55,667
Kind of Your Grace to take note.
And this must be Attila.

600
01:02:55,708 --> 01:02:59,492
Grachia is the current champion
of the Circus Maximus.

601
01:02:59,535 --> 01:03:03,603
- Finest charioteer in the empire.
- Come and watch me race.

602
01:03:03,639 --> 01:03:06,486
I'll make sure you have
the finest seat.

603
01:03:07,536 --> 01:03:10,726
A chariot driver at a royal banquet?

604
01:03:11,815 --> 01:03:15,184
It's shameful how this city
fawns over athletes.

605
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:17,833
Some of them
have more money than I do.

606
01:04:06,506 --> 01:04:08,415
It suits you nicely.

607
01:04:11,446 --> 01:04:14,744
I wear it tonight only.

608
01:04:14,785 --> 01:04:17,940
- I have another present.
- It's not necessary.

609
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:20,097
I insist.

610
01:04:29,502 --> 01:04:31,613
What is this place?

611
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:33,735
A bath.

612
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,317
Go on, step in.

613
01:04:38,999 --> 01:04:41,596
You've never seen one?

614
01:04:43,244 --> 01:04:46,921
Aetius has only shown you
fortresses and aqueducts,

615
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:51,343
but I think the bath
is Rome's greatest achievement.

616
01:04:59,004 --> 01:05:01,115
It's hot.

617
01:05:01,195 --> 01:05:02,654
Yes.

618
01:05:02,691 --> 01:05:04,673
That's the point.

619
01:05:06,031 --> 01:05:07,728
How's it done?

620
01:05:07,771 --> 01:05:10,653
A furnace, a few pipes.

621
01:05:10,693 --> 01:05:12,567
It doesn't matter.

622
01:05:12,606 --> 01:05:16,319
It's very soothing
once you get used to the heat.

623
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:20,671
I had a feeling you might like it.

624
01:05:20,713 --> 01:05:23,667
I'm not as stupid as people think...

625
01:05:23,704 --> 01:05:25,780
as you probably think.

626
01:05:26,835 --> 01:05:32,114
It's just that brains don't
do a woman much good in Rome.

627
01:05:34,072 --> 01:05:36,148
Mummy's an exception.

628
01:05:37,204 --> 01:05:39,148
She had real power.

629
01:05:39,187 --> 01:05:42,342
But she's made sure
that I never will.

630
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:47,594
She favors my brother and has done
since the day he was born.

631
01:05:47,641 --> 01:05:51,460
He's a hopeless ninny,
but he's a man.

632
01:05:52,476 --> 01:05:54,136
So that's that.

633
01:05:56,059 --> 01:05:59,736
I say, if a woman can only
have power through a man,

634
01:05:59,782 --> 01:06:05,417
then let it be with the most
powerful man she can find.

635
01:06:33,215 --> 01:06:37,771
- (Sighs ) Rua grows old.
- What do you want me to do?

636
01:06:38,851 --> 01:06:42,326
He likes to drink ale
in the mid morning.

637
01:06:43,235 --> 01:06:48,656
Put this in the bowl
next to his bed.

638
01:06:48,697 --> 01:06:52,623
He will die peacefully,
and you will live well.

639
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,173
I was afraid you weren't coming.

640
01:07:16,216 --> 01:07:19,062
I have other things
to tend to besides you.

641
01:07:19,104 --> 01:07:21,322
I need mushrooms for my potions.

642
01:07:21,365 --> 01:07:25,006
Besides, Bleda hardly
touches you any more, anyway.

643
01:07:25,088 --> 01:07:26,712
Galen, wait.

644
01:07:26,757 --> 01:07:29,532
He's planning to have Rua murdered.

645
01:07:29,575 --> 01:07:31,343
Be quiet!

646
01:07:31,384 --> 01:07:35,168
You could be killed
for saying that, and I for hearing.

647
01:07:35,211 --> 01:07:38,544
Bleda bribed a guard to poison him.
I heard them.

648
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:40,696
You have to do something.

649
01:07:40,743 --> 01:07:42,652
- What can I do?
- Warn Rua.

650
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:46,131
- He wouldn't listen to me.
- Then use your powers.

651
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:51,556
It may be best for us if Rua dies.

652
01:07:51,597 --> 01:07:53,958
And Bleda becomes king?

653
01:07:53,997 --> 01:07:57,259
- Where is Attila?
- Rome.

654
01:07:57,303 --> 01:07:59,805
- How long has he been there?
- Weeks.

655
01:07:59,843 --> 01:08:02,025
Why does he tarry?

656
01:08:04,192 --> 01:08:06,065
I don't know.

657
01:08:06,105 --> 01:08:09,580
If there's one thing
that will bring him back,

658
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:12,288
it's news of Rua's death.

659
01:08:13,341 --> 01:08:16,152
Attila must return.

660
01:08:17,237 --> 01:08:19,146
You love him.

661
01:08:19,186 --> 01:08:22,211
A woman who does not is blind.

662
01:08:23,291 --> 01:08:26,316
But he would never love a toadstool.

663
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:33,338
- Why do you help me?
- You're in my visions.

664
01:08:33,381 --> 01:08:35,254
I must be true to them,

665
01:08:35,294 --> 01:08:39,221
and my visions tell me
Attila is in danger.

666
01:08:39,259 --> 01:08:42,379
He must return. Therefore,

667
01:08:42,426 --> 01:08:47,253
let today's king die
that tomorrow's may live.

668
01:08:56,829 --> 01:09:01,621
When you said Rome would seduce him,
I didn't know you meant my daughter.

669
01:09:01,665 --> 01:09:05,176
- I had nothing to do with it.
- It cannot continue.

670
01:09:05,213 --> 01:09:08,333
A marriage
would formalize the alliance.

671
01:09:08,379 --> 01:09:11,961
Married to a barbarian?
She'd be a laughing stock.

672
01:09:11,998 --> 01:09:16,481
I doubt it. But at least there'd be
a Rome to do the laughing.

673
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,675
Spare me your speech
about sacrifices for the empire.

674
01:09:19,721 --> 01:09:24,240
- Like it or not, we must make them.
- She's not yours to barter with.

675
01:09:24,278 --> 01:09:27,753
An alliance with the Huns
will secure our borders,

676
01:09:27,792 --> 01:09:30,983
and buy us time to make
ourselves great again.

677
01:09:32,071 --> 01:09:35,546
If he'll have her, they will marry.

678
01:09:35,619 --> 01:09:37,766
Over my dead body.

679
01:09:37,812 --> 01:09:40,279
Well, if you insist.

680
01:09:50,231 --> 01:09:53,351
He puts too much faith
in his influence over Attila.

681
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:55,474
Even if this marriage occurred

682
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,853
the Huns might think it
a great joke to attack us anyway.

683
01:09:58,895 --> 01:10:01,812
- It must not occur.
- The girl is obsessed.

684
01:10:01,886 --> 01:10:04,317
It may require drastic measures.

685
01:10:05,748 --> 01:10:07,824
Then take them.

686
01:10:09,853 --> 01:10:14,016
And Aetius
has outlived his usefulness.

687
01:10:15,141 --> 01:10:17,193
I understand.

688
01:10:22,169 --> 01:10:25,988
I never believed in destiny before,
but I do now.

689
01:10:26,031 --> 01:10:29,613
It was destiny
that brought us together.

690
01:10:29,649 --> 01:10:32,318
Do you believe in destiny, Attila?

691
01:10:32,363 --> 01:10:35,459
- Perhaps.
- Good.

692
01:10:35,494 --> 01:10:38,614
So many people
are so boringly virtuous.

693
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:42,443
"The will of God" this
and "the will of God" that.

694
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:46,235
Actually, I only know
one other person

695
01:10:46,314 --> 01:10:50,062
who really takes destiny seriously.

696
01:10:50,106 --> 01:10:51,980
Flavius Aetius.

697
01:10:52,019 --> 01:10:54,866
Strange, isn't it?

698
01:10:54,906 --> 01:10:59,390
I despise him but adore you.

699
01:11:00,577 --> 01:11:05,025
- What's his destiny?
- To save Rome, he says.

700
01:11:06,144 --> 01:11:08,397
And what's yours?

701
01:11:10,527 --> 01:11:13,445
A soothsayer in my village
says I'll find a sword.

702
01:11:13,484 --> 01:11:15,845
And when you find it?

703
01:11:16,998 --> 01:11:19,465
I'll rule the world.

704
01:11:19,503 --> 01:11:21,970
How sad for Aetius.

705
01:11:22,008 --> 01:11:25,342
Aetius can take care of himself.

706
01:11:27,922 --> 01:11:30,662
If you'll excuse me.

707
01:11:34,811 --> 01:11:38,251
- What do you think of her?
- She's pleasing.

708
01:11:38,289 --> 01:11:40,959
That's all?

709
01:11:41,003 --> 01:11:43,850
What else is there to say of a woman?

710
01:11:43,891 --> 01:11:47,924
(Chuckles ) You've never loved, then.

711
01:11:47,961 --> 01:11:51,116
Once. Perhaps.

712
01:11:52,901 --> 01:11:56,305
The slave girl, the red-haired one.

713
01:11:58,955 --> 01:12:02,501
A man in your position
can have as many women as you wish.

714
01:12:02,538 --> 01:12:04,614
Those that you love...

715
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:06,807
and those that are merely...

716
01:12:06,852 --> 01:12:08,928
useful.

717
01:12:08,975 --> 01:12:11,892
And if your destiny
is to conquer the world,

718
01:12:11,932 --> 01:12:15,609
you could do worse
than ally yourself with Rome.

719
01:12:15,654 --> 01:12:19,260
What if Rome is part of the world
I'm meant to conquer?

720
01:12:19,308 --> 01:12:22,985
Well, there are many ways to conquer.

721
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:26,707
You captured Honoria
without striking a blow,

722
01:12:26,752 --> 01:12:30,465
and she may be the key
to your next conquest.

723
01:12:32,702 --> 01:12:36,972
To conquest, however achieved.

724
01:12:39,972 --> 01:12:43,198
Father, this message
was brought to the villa.

725
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:57,082
Rua is dead.

726
01:12:59,977 --> 01:13:02,930
- I must leave at once.
- It's a bad season for travel.

727
01:13:02,969 --> 01:13:05,602
Bleda will be plotting against me.

728
01:13:05,648 --> 01:13:09,431
Get a fresh start in the morning.
I'll send an escort.

729
01:13:09,474 --> 01:13:12,629
Send a messenger
to announce your return,

730
01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:16,980
but take a different route
to make assassination difficult.

731
01:13:17,024 --> 01:13:20,570
Challenge him quickly,
and have a reason besides ambition.

732
01:13:20,608 --> 01:13:24,534
- A pretext.
- Exactly.

733
01:13:24,574 --> 01:13:28,642
For example, you might
accuse him of murdering Rua.

734
01:13:28,679 --> 01:13:31,775
- The fact is, he probably did.
- I have no proof.

735
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:35,285
It's no matter. It's good politics.

736
01:13:35,324 --> 01:13:37,826
It'll put him on the defensive.

737
01:13:38,907 --> 01:13:41,339
Attila...

738
01:13:41,377 --> 01:13:46,205
if things go badly, you know
you may always seek shelter here.

739
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:50,693
I will live or die among the Huns.

740
01:13:53,798 --> 01:13:57,546
Then rest.
You have a long journey ahead of you.

741
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:12,686
Have you been eavesdropping?

742
01:14:12,723 --> 01:14:15,119
No, learning.

743
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:18,598
You'll miss him, won't you?

744
01:14:18,637 --> 01:14:20,713
Yes, I'll miss him.

745
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:24,235
Rome produces
few such men these days.

746
01:14:25,352 --> 01:14:28,542
This Bleda,
will he really try to kill him?

747
01:14:28,587 --> 01:14:30,698
Of course.

748
01:14:31,962 --> 01:14:35,117
I'll say a prayer for him
before I go to sleep.

749
01:14:35,162 --> 01:14:36,858
Yes.

750
01:14:37,946 --> 01:14:40,199
Say one for Rome as well.

751
01:14:49,879 --> 01:14:51,955
Oh, I beg pardon, master.

752
01:14:52,001 --> 01:14:53,982
I thought you were leaving.

753
01:14:55,549 --> 01:14:57,530
(Coughs )

754
01:14:58,924 --> 01:15:01,498
(Gasping)

755
01:16:03,494 --> 01:16:05,332
Take him!

756
01:16:09,444 --> 01:16:11,555
Take him! Your king commands it!

757
01:16:16,332 --> 01:16:18,171
You are not yet king.

758
01:16:18,211 --> 01:16:20,358
Bring me my crown! Quickly!

759
01:16:20,403 --> 01:16:24,745
You see how he wants to steal
the crown, as he stole Rua's life?

760
01:16:24,786 --> 01:16:27,526
You lie.

761
01:16:27,569 --> 01:16:30,036
Rua should have died as he lived.

762
01:16:30,075 --> 01:16:32,542
A warrior, not in his sleep.

763
01:16:32,579 --> 01:16:35,877
No man can choose
the manner of his own death.

764
01:16:35,919 --> 01:16:40,153
- No, not if he's murdered.
- Rua died without issue,

765
01:16:40,198 --> 01:16:42,903
and I am the elder son
of his brother.

766
01:16:42,946 --> 01:16:45,484
Therefore, I am the rightful king.

767
01:16:45,521 --> 01:16:50,076
To what purpose? To be paid
for fighting in the service of Rome

768
01:16:50,114 --> 01:16:51,987
or some other nation?

769
01:16:52,027 --> 01:16:54,696
We will live
as Huns have always lived.

770
01:16:54,741 --> 01:16:57,481
What else should we do?

771
01:16:57,524 --> 01:16:59,706
We should rule the world!

772
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:02,181
You'd have us attack Rome?

773
01:17:04,795 --> 01:17:06,254
No.

774
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:08,888
(Bleda ) He has been bought off.

775
01:17:08,935 --> 01:17:13,834
Besides, he has a whore in Rome
who calls herself a princess.

776
01:17:18,815 --> 01:17:23,406
If we attack Rome,
we leave our flanks open.

777
01:17:23,442 --> 01:17:26,882
We will return
to find our villages burned

778
01:17:26,922 --> 01:17:29,139
and our women gone.

779
01:17:29,183 --> 01:17:32,100
(Priest) You've said
what we should not do,

780
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:34,880
but you've not said
what we should do.

781
01:17:36,593 --> 01:17:39,927
Attack north... Pannonia and beyond.

782
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:43,573
- Attack our own people?!
- Not of our tribe.

783
01:17:43,621 --> 01:17:45,174
But Huns nonetheless,

784
01:17:45,221 --> 01:17:47,997
and we've been at peace
for many years.

785
01:17:48,039 --> 01:17:51,929
And war will come again,
as it always has.

786
01:17:54,788 --> 01:18:00,766
You all know the ancient prophecy.
A conqueror will rise among us.

787
01:18:00,807 --> 01:18:04,697
The one who finds
the war god's sword.

788
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:08,036
Have you found this sword?

789
01:18:11,592 --> 01:18:13,051
No.

790
01:18:13,087 --> 01:18:15,898
Then your words are empty.

791
01:18:17,645 --> 01:18:20,006
I will give a different sign.

792
01:18:23,768 --> 01:18:26,650
I say you murdered Rua,

793
01:18:26,691 --> 01:18:29,573
and are not fit to take his place.

794
01:18:29,613 --> 01:18:32,602
And I say you lie.

795
01:18:32,639 --> 01:18:35,735
Then we'll meet tomorrow
when the sun awakens.

796
01:18:35,771 --> 01:18:38,890
Let the strongest prevail.

797
01:18:38,937 --> 01:18:42,341
And that will be the sign.

798
01:19:18,945 --> 01:19:21,341
He will tip his arrows with poison.

799
01:19:23,677 --> 01:19:27,496
If I die of poison, the tribe
will kill him. He knows that.

800
01:19:27,539 --> 01:19:30,658
This poison leaves no sign.

801
01:19:30,704 --> 01:19:33,409
How would Bleda get such a poison?

802
01:19:37,453 --> 01:19:38,698
You?

803
01:19:41,281 --> 01:19:42,941
Galen...

804
01:19:45,526 --> 01:19:47,851
What evil have you worked for him?

805
01:19:47,890 --> 01:19:49,658
Did he poison Rua?

806
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:52,167
Bleda swore he'd kill me
if I didn't help.

807
01:19:52,205 --> 01:19:55,230
Besides, I knew it would
bring you back from Rome.

808
01:19:55,266 --> 01:19:58,042
- I would have come back anyway!
- My visions...

809
01:19:58,084 --> 01:20:00,931
- Your visions!
- I was right to do what I did.

810
01:20:00,972 --> 01:20:03,818
This time tomorrow you'll be king.

811
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:06,492
- Give me some of your poison!
- I have none.

812
01:20:06,538 --> 01:20:10,500
There are no more mushrooms.
I've been looking for weeks.

813
01:20:12,801 --> 01:20:16,869
Then you've not only killed Rua,
you've killed me.

814
01:20:16,905 --> 01:20:21,212
No. If the poison enters you,
I'll draw it out.

815
01:20:21,254 --> 01:20:25,181
How? Will you be riding next to me
on a horse of your own?

816
01:20:25,221 --> 01:20:28,934
Attila, find the sword.

817
01:20:30,439 --> 01:20:33,630
If you have the sword,
nothing can touch you.

818
01:20:33,675 --> 01:20:37,565
Nobody has found it
in a hundred years.

819
01:20:37,605 --> 01:20:40,701
How am I supposed to find it
before sunrise?

820
01:20:56,392 --> 01:20:58,539
I'm through with you, woman.

821
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:03,025
Never speak to me again.

822
01:21:59,919 --> 01:22:02,517
Hyah! Hyah! Come on!

823
01:22:12,896 --> 01:22:14,972
(Chanting)

824
01:22:16,236 --> 01:22:20,755
Powers of earth and sky, be true
to the visions you have shown me.

825
01:22:20,793 --> 01:22:25,656
Give Galen's strength to Attila
and Attila's pain to Galen.

826
01:22:33,005 --> 01:22:35,081
(Groaning)

827
01:22:39,684 --> 01:22:41,629
(Groans )

828
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:49,072
(Grunting)

829
01:23:09,186 --> 01:23:10,645
Hyah!

830
01:23:15,414 --> 01:23:17,217
(Gasps )

831
01:23:29,121 --> 01:23:30,366
Hah!

832
01:23:33,053 --> 01:23:35,164
Ha. Ha.

833
01:23:38,444 --> 01:23:40,283
(Gasps )

834
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:52,391
(Screams )

835
01:23:59,423 --> 01:24:01,819
(Chanting)

836
01:24:14,453 --> 01:24:19,459
Give Galen's strength to Attila
and Attila's pain to Galen.

837
01:25:16,901 --> 01:25:19,533
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Hah!

838
01:26:08,251 --> 01:26:12,141
(Chanting) Attila! Attila! Attila!

839
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:26,262
(Chanting continues )

840
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:55,302
(Crack)

841
01:28:05,396 --> 01:28:07,056
(Yells)

842
01:28:50,031 --> 01:28:54,302
(Valentinian )
Aetius, what are the Huns up to?

843
01:28:54,346 --> 01:28:57,821
Attila is attacking
to the north of Pannonia, sire.

844
01:28:57,859 --> 01:29:02,201
Didn't you say there were just...
just more Huns to the north?

845
01:29:03,216 --> 01:29:05,648
Then he's fighting his own people.

846
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:10,973
Well done, Aetius.

847
01:29:11,009 --> 01:29:13,476
All to your greater glory, Majesty.

848
01:29:17,654 --> 01:29:21,023
You may fool an inexperienced youth,

849
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:24,574
but you know that Attila
isn't just attacking the Huns.

850
01:29:24,613 --> 01:29:28,290
- He's uniting them.
- At least he's not fighting us.

851
01:29:28,335 --> 01:29:31,395
But if he ever does,
the danger is twice as great.

852
01:29:31,432 --> 01:29:33,484
He will not attack Rome.

853
01:29:33,519 --> 01:29:36,745
He'll attack the Germans,
the Eastern Empire, but not Rome.

854
01:29:36,789 --> 01:29:38,105
How can you be sure?

855
01:29:38,146 --> 01:29:41,241
In Rome, he saw things
he'd never dreamed of.

856
01:29:41,277 --> 01:29:43,388
I saw doubt grow in his eyes.

857
01:29:43,434 --> 01:29:47,361
He came certain he could defeat us.
He left uncertain.

858
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:51,327
- And there's one other factor.
- What's that?

859
01:29:51,367 --> 01:29:54,248
Attacking Rome
would mean attacking me,

860
01:29:55,332 --> 01:29:58,072
and that, he will never do.

861
01:29:58,116 --> 01:30:03,086
- And if something happens to you?
- We'll have to see that it doesn't.

862
01:30:06,221 --> 01:30:08,368
Wine, anyone?

863
01:30:12,309 --> 01:30:14,883
We miss you, Galen.

864
01:30:14,919 --> 01:30:18,359
I wonder if
she still has her visions.

865
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:20,830
She had a vision about this place.

866
01:30:23,025 --> 01:30:27,224
- Near my old village.
- She's the reason I claimed it.

867
01:30:27,269 --> 01:30:29,843
That's why I buried her here.

868
01:30:41,150 --> 01:30:43,439
(N'Kara ) Will you go away again?

869
01:30:43,482 --> 01:30:46,257
(Attila ) It depends
what my scouts say.

870
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:48,897
(N'Kara ) You'll attack
Constantinople?

871
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:52,906
Not the city itself.
Not at first anyway.

872
01:30:53,989 --> 01:30:56,527
But the provinces are rich.

873
01:30:56,563 --> 01:30:58,639
Can't you postpone it?

874
01:31:00,425 --> 01:31:04,944
N'Kara, I have only
just begun to build my empire.

875
01:31:05,017 --> 01:31:07,448
I have to think of the future.

876
01:31:07,487 --> 01:31:09,954
I am thinking of the future.

877
01:31:09,991 --> 01:31:12,945
A king must teach
his prince how to govern.

878
01:31:12,984 --> 01:31:15,060
Prince?

879
01:31:16,706 --> 01:31:19,826
The midwives
confirmed it this morning.

880
01:31:24,603 --> 01:31:29,194
- I hope it will be a boy.
- Oh, it will! I know it will!

881
01:31:30,274 --> 01:31:32,350
(Laughing)

882
01:31:42,033 --> 01:31:44,109
Why doesn't he come?

883
01:31:46,313 --> 01:31:49,752
If he doesn't come soon,
you will die.

884
01:31:49,792 --> 01:31:53,540
A baby cannot be hurried,
even for a king.

885
01:31:53,584 --> 01:31:56,217
He will come when he comes.

886
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,036
Just see that he comes safely!

887
01:32:17,102 --> 01:32:19,083
Oh, you gods.

888
01:32:20,859 --> 01:32:22,935
Make it a boy.

889
01:32:24,651 --> 01:32:26,632
Make it a boy.

890
01:32:26,669 --> 01:32:28,851
Make him strong.

891
01:32:31,714 --> 01:32:34,039
A boy, Your Majesty.

892
01:32:50,222 --> 01:32:51,752
Yes.

893
01:32:52,831 --> 01:32:54,907
The son of a king.

894
01:32:59,129 --> 01:33:00,932
And N'Kara?

895
01:33:33,710 --> 01:33:35,786
N'Kara.

896
01:33:40,667 --> 01:33:42,506
You have your prince.

897
01:33:49,052 --> 01:33:51,128
Teach him well.

898
01:33:59,211 --> 01:34:00,871
No.

899
01:34:03,386 --> 01:34:04,809
No!

900
01:34:42,664 --> 01:34:44,740
(Thunder)

901
01:35:03,747 --> 01:35:05,822
Was this part of your vision?!

902
01:35:05,868 --> 01:35:10,032
Was this part of your vision,
and you didn't tell me?!

903
01:35:11,087 --> 01:35:13,305
I curse you, Galen!

904
01:35:14,392 --> 01:35:18,591
- And I curse you, gods!
- (Thunder crashes )

905
01:35:26,917 --> 01:35:29,099
(Grunting)

906
01:36:16,632 --> 01:36:18,778
(Yelling)

907
01:36:42,724 --> 01:36:44,112
Kneel!

908
01:36:44,151 --> 01:36:47,306
Kneel before your new king.

909
01:36:48,569 --> 01:36:50,478
Submit to him!

910
01:38:19,963 --> 01:38:24,067
(Woman ) The messenger said
the campaign was successful.

911
01:38:24,103 --> 01:38:26,570
Yes. The city fell quickly.

912
01:38:26,608 --> 01:38:30,534
The new siege engines worked
even better than I'd hoped.

913
01:38:30,574 --> 01:38:32,650
I'm glad.

914
01:38:34,436 --> 01:38:37,033
- You're well?
- Yes.

915
01:38:37,079 --> 01:38:39,784
- You were obeyed in my absence?
- Yes.

916
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:45,916
- And my other wives?
- Also well, my lord.

917
01:38:45,951 --> 01:38:48,027
Good.

918
01:38:49,639 --> 01:38:51,892
Where's my son?

919
01:38:51,935 --> 01:38:56,834
You have many sons, my lord.
Of which do you speak?

920
01:38:56,875 --> 01:38:58,571
The eldest.

921
01:38:59,658 --> 01:39:02,540
You have a dozen wives,

922
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:05,083
twice that many children.

923
01:39:06,581 --> 01:39:09,214
And yet, all of us taken together

924
01:39:09,261 --> 01:39:11,834
don't pleasure you
as much as he does.

925
01:39:11,869 --> 01:39:16,388
- He's my first-born.
- And child of the red-haired woman.

926
01:39:17,610 --> 01:39:20,635
I hold court this afternoon.

927
01:39:20,672 --> 01:39:23,554
In the meantime, I wish to rest.

928
01:39:24,638 --> 01:39:25,776
Attila...

929
01:39:29,856 --> 01:39:31,730
I missed you.

930
01:39:33,266 --> 01:39:35,175
It's good to be back.

931
01:39:50,104 --> 01:39:52,180
Attila...

932
01:39:52,226 --> 01:39:54,586
King of the Huns,

933
01:39:54,627 --> 01:39:58,755
lord of all lands from
the frozen ocean to the Black Sea,

934
01:39:58,802 --> 01:40:02,728
from the River Rhine
to the mountains of the East.

935
01:40:14,944 --> 01:40:19,013
Our Great King graciously
gives you leave to rise.

936
01:40:26,982 --> 01:40:30,101
I am King Canute of the Finns.

937
01:40:30,147 --> 01:40:35,082
We welcome you as a friend
and as a loyal subject.

938
01:40:35,122 --> 01:40:41,314
I bring tribute. Furs, gold
and silver, spices and perfumes.

939
01:40:42,602 --> 01:40:45,662
In the name of my people,
I accept the tribute.

940
01:40:58,884 --> 01:41:01,315
I am King Meloch of the Parthians.

941
01:41:01,354 --> 01:41:04,687
I beg you to settle a dispute
between myself

942
01:41:04,729 --> 01:41:06,603
and King Omar of Scythia.

943
01:41:06,642 --> 01:41:10,153
- Concerning what?
- The boundary between our nations.

944
01:41:10,191 --> 01:41:12,551
- Where is Omar?
- He arrives tomorrow.

945
01:41:12,591 --> 01:41:15,746
Justice requires that
I hear both parties at once.

946
01:41:15,792 --> 01:41:18,365
Yes, but if you only...

947
01:41:20,279 --> 01:41:24,906
Yes...Great King. Tomorrow.

948
01:41:28,316 --> 01:41:31,092
Attila. Attila.

949
01:41:33,048 --> 01:41:34,708
Attila.

950
01:41:35,552 --> 01:41:39,514
He's all I hear about.
I thought we were finished with him.

951
01:41:39,554 --> 01:41:43,682
No such luck, Majesty. He's still
here and stronger than ever.

952
01:41:43,729 --> 01:41:46,231
As long as he doesn't trouble us.

953
01:41:46,268 --> 01:41:50,265
But he troubles the rest
of the world, and they trouble us.

954
01:41:50,304 --> 01:41:53,945
Pleas for help
from Scythia, Alericum, Moesia,

955
01:41:53,992 --> 01:41:56,459
and from Theodosius himself.

956
01:41:56,496 --> 01:41:59,272
"From Theodosius,
Emperor of the East,

957
01:41:59,314 --> 01:42:01,984
"to his beloved nephew,
Valentinian.

958
01:42:02,063 --> 01:42:05,847
"I beseech you, send aid,
we are overrun by the Huns."

959
01:42:05,889 --> 01:42:07,549
Overrun.

960
01:42:07,594 --> 01:42:12,007
He exaggerates. The walls of
Constantinople are 20 feet thick.

961
01:42:12,047 --> 01:42:15,108
But dozens of smaller cities
have fallen.

962
01:42:15,144 --> 01:42:17,433
The provinces are stripped bare.

963
01:42:17,474 --> 01:42:21,922
Attila demands 3,000lbs of gold
to remove his troops.

964
01:42:23,389 --> 01:42:28,739
A Roman emperor, subject to
extortion like a common shopkeeper.

965
01:42:28,781 --> 01:42:31,557
(Placidia ) And if
Constantinople falls,

966
01:42:31,599 --> 01:42:35,834
there will be nothing left
for Attila to conquer but us.

967
01:42:35,878 --> 01:42:40,077
Aetius, you said if he threatened
the West it would be on your head.

968
01:42:40,123 --> 01:42:42,376
Do you begin to feel the weight?

969
01:42:52,752 --> 01:42:54,804
(Sighs )

970
01:42:54,839 --> 01:42:57,306
Well, Aetius?

971
01:42:58,806 --> 01:43:02,969
Once before, when Attila threatened,
I took a journey to meet him.

972
01:43:03,015 --> 01:43:06,384
- I propose to take another.
- To the Eastern Empire?

973
01:43:06,424 --> 01:43:08,156
Yes.

974
01:43:08,199 --> 01:43:12,054
I'll assess the situation
and deal with it personally.

975
01:43:12,095 --> 01:43:13,649
Yes.

976
01:43:14,253 --> 01:43:17,514
Good idea. Go immediately.

977
01:43:25,455 --> 01:43:29,867
- A word, Majesty, about your sister.
- What about her?

978
01:43:29,908 --> 01:43:32,541
It is rumored
that she's plotting against you.

979
01:43:32,587 --> 01:43:34,531
What? With whom?

980
01:43:34,570 --> 01:43:37,524
- With Eugenius, sire.
- Eugenius?

981
01:43:39,301 --> 01:43:43,121
- Not Eugenius her chamberlain?
- The same, sire.

982
01:43:45,181 --> 01:43:49,700
Honoria is conspiring against me...

983
01:43:49,738 --> 01:43:52,205
with a butler?!

984
01:43:57,566 --> 01:43:59,783
You are a goddess.

985
01:43:59,862 --> 01:44:03,266
We'll avoid killing him
if possible.

986
01:44:03,307 --> 01:44:05,939
He's a dolt, but he is my brother.

987
01:44:05,985 --> 01:44:08,132
I've never known such passion.

988
01:44:09,255 --> 01:44:13,288
Perhaps the fall festival
would be the best time to strike.

989
01:44:13,326 --> 01:44:17,003
No, Latorius doesn't think so.
He says it's too soon.

990
01:44:17,048 --> 01:44:19,550
You spoke of our plans to Latorius?

991
01:44:19,588 --> 01:44:22,505
We need an officer
of the guard on our side.

992
01:44:23,588 --> 01:44:26,435
My beautiful, stupid Eugenius.

993
01:44:27,346 --> 01:44:31,415
We must keep everything secret
until we are ready to...

994
01:44:39,696 --> 01:44:44,347
You should be leaving soon, Father.
The tide goes out at sunset.

995
01:44:44,394 --> 01:44:47,869
- News?
- Yes. Honoria's coming with me.

996
01:44:47,907 --> 01:44:50,196
She's been exiled to the East.

997
01:44:50,238 --> 01:44:52,385
She might have been executed.

998
01:44:52,429 --> 01:44:57,222
She'll probably wish she had been.
She's been given to Pulcheria.

999
01:44:57,265 --> 01:45:01,192
- I almost feel sorry for her.
- So do I, almost.

1000
01:45:01,232 --> 01:45:03,901
If you see Attila,
remember me to him.

1001
01:45:03,946 --> 01:45:07,729
Placidia was right.
I should have had him killed here.

1002
01:45:07,772 --> 01:45:10,133
He was a guest in our home.

1003
01:45:10,172 --> 01:45:14,371
Yes, well, I have to see
how dangerous he's become.

1004
01:45:16,087 --> 01:45:18,104
Take care while I'm away.

1005
01:45:18,139 --> 01:45:20,215
I will.

1006
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:27,939
- Did you meet with the ambassador?
- Briefly.

1007
01:45:27,985 --> 01:45:31,531
The longer I put him off,
the more gold he's willing to pay.

1008
01:45:32,613 --> 01:45:35,803
And yet, is that a gain
worthy of a great king?

1009
01:45:35,848 --> 01:45:39,394
I have long ears, sire,
the better to serve you,

1010
01:45:39,432 --> 01:45:42,349
and they've heard talk
among your generals.

1011
01:45:42,389 --> 01:45:45,899
Their loyalty is absolute,
yet they wonder.

1012
01:45:45,937 --> 01:45:48,013
We've conquered a hundred nations,

1013
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:51,464
pressed the Eastern Empire
to Constantinople,

1014
01:45:51,503 --> 01:45:55,358
- yet do not move against the West.
- The time is not right.

1015
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:58,590
- When will it be right, sire?
- When I say it is.

1016
01:46:00,062 --> 01:46:02,635
What other reason is given, Orestes?

1017
01:46:06,254 --> 01:46:09,445
Some say, sire, that you fear Aetius.

1018
01:46:11,438 --> 01:46:14,629
Forgive me, sire. A foolish rumor.

1019
01:46:16,135 --> 01:46:18,638
Who spreads this rumor?

1020
01:46:20,449 --> 01:46:22,525
- You, Great King.
- I?

1021
01:46:22,571 --> 01:46:25,560
Yes, by your refusal
to move against the West.

1022
01:46:27,825 --> 01:46:31,537
- You have courage, Orestes.
- (Sighs )

1023
01:46:31,581 --> 01:46:35,508
I would not serve you if I
did not dare to speak the truth.

1024
01:46:37,496 --> 01:46:43,332
I am ruler, not only of the Huns,
but of the hundred nations.

1025
01:46:43,376 --> 01:46:48,453
- Whose kings obey your commands.
- I need more than their obedience.

1026
01:46:48,490 --> 01:46:50,708
- I need their belief.
- In what, sire?

1027
01:46:50,751 --> 01:46:52,624
That's what I wait for.

1028
01:46:52,665 --> 01:46:57,315
The thing that will make them
not merely serve, but believe.

1029
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:03,928
- A sign, like the war god's sword?
- A sign or a reason.

1030
01:47:05,015 --> 01:47:07,376
What Aetius used to call a pretext.

1031
01:47:07,415 --> 01:47:09,918
And when it comes, I will know,

1032
01:47:09,955 --> 01:47:13,845
and then I will move
against the Western Empire.

1033
01:47:13,886 --> 01:47:14,681
Yes, sire.

1034
01:47:17,331 --> 01:47:19,407
CONSTANTINOPLE
CAPITAL OF THE EASTERN EMPIRE

1035
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:33,713
Aetius, welcome to the East.

1036
01:47:33,752 --> 01:47:36,077
(Aetius ) Thank you, Majesty.

1037
01:47:36,152 --> 01:47:39,556
I have kept your arrival secret,
as you requested.

1038
01:47:39,596 --> 01:47:41,814
It suits my purpose. Thank you.

1039
01:47:43,806 --> 01:47:48,433
And Honoria, I have not seen you
since you were six years old.

1040
01:47:48,468 --> 01:47:51,006
It pains me
that you grew up to be a traitor.

1041
01:47:51,042 --> 01:47:55,561
Fortunately, my sister Pulcheria
has agreed to take you in.

1042
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:57,403
Take me in to what?

1043
01:47:58,244 --> 01:48:03,001
Into a life dedicated to celibacy
and to the works of God.

1044
01:48:04,853 --> 01:48:08,816
- You must be joking.
- We shall see if I am joking.

1045
01:48:08,855 --> 01:48:12,533
- The devil's got in you.
- I'm not joining any ridiculous...

1046
01:48:12,612 --> 01:48:15,114
(Pulcheria ) But we'll get him out.

1047
01:48:15,152 --> 01:48:18,177
I can see we have
a lot of work ahead of us.

1048
01:48:23,293 --> 01:48:26,662
I had hoped you would bring troops,
Aetius.

1049
01:48:26,702 --> 01:48:29,205
Ever since Attila crushed our army,

1050
01:48:29,241 --> 01:48:32,052
we huddle, trembling,
behind our walls.

1051
01:48:32,094 --> 01:48:34,526
We have no troops to spare, Majesty.

1052
01:48:34,565 --> 01:48:38,384
- And money?
- Alas, we're short there, too.

1053
01:48:38,426 --> 01:48:41,343
Then why did you bother to come?

1054
01:48:42,879 --> 01:48:44,991
To devise a plan, sire.

1055
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:49,271
But it will take time.

1056
01:48:50,464 --> 01:48:52,860
We don't have time.

1057
01:48:52,899 --> 01:48:57,383
The nobles sell their very furniture
to meet Attila's demands,

1058
01:48:57,421 --> 01:48:59,888
while refugees flood the city.

1059
01:48:59,927 --> 01:49:03,188
The rich give them work
to prevent riots.

1060
01:49:03,232 --> 01:49:06,114
As you can see, I do my share.

1061
01:49:10,085 --> 01:49:14,948
You spoke of a plan.
What do you mean exactly?

1062
01:49:16,035 --> 01:49:19,131
An empire built so quickly
will have weaknesses.

1063
01:49:19,166 --> 01:49:22,048
(Theodosius )
How will you discover them?

1064
01:49:22,088 --> 01:49:25,005
(Aetius )
I'll visit Attila's territory.

1065
01:49:25,046 --> 01:49:29,387
(Theodosius ) Rather vague.
I have something more specific.

1066
01:49:29,429 --> 01:49:31,481
Assassination.

1067
01:49:34,856 --> 01:49:36,932
Forgive me, Aetius.

1068
01:49:36,978 --> 01:49:39,895
I wanted you to see
his work first-hand.

1069
01:49:41,953 --> 01:49:44,349
This is Lygus,

1070
01:49:44,388 --> 01:49:47,021
adept at seeing without being seen,

1071
01:49:47,068 --> 01:49:49,700
skilful with weapons,

1072
01:49:49,746 --> 01:49:51,371
as you can see.

1073
01:49:51,451 --> 01:49:54,820
And best of all, he has no tongue.

1074
01:49:54,860 --> 01:49:58,229
So if he's caught,
he can't give me away.

1075
01:50:00,705 --> 01:50:02,958
Attila has spies as we do.

1076
01:50:04,045 --> 01:50:06,892
He'll hear of your plan and foil it.

1077
01:50:06,932 --> 01:50:10,266
Perhaps, perhaps not.

1078
01:50:14,655 --> 01:50:17,680
- You like the girl?
- A refugee?

1079
01:50:17,718 --> 01:50:21,786
Her family was slaughtered by
the Huns. Shall I send her to you?

1080
01:50:21,823 --> 01:50:25,156
Yes, if I may request
one alteration.

1081
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:28,566
Please yourself. She is yours.

1082
01:50:39,774 --> 01:50:41,328
Your name?

1083
01:50:41,375 --> 01:50:43,557
Ilidico.

1084
01:50:45,966 --> 01:50:49,512
They tell me you have reason
to hate the Huns.

1085
01:50:49,550 --> 01:50:52,776
My father was village chieftain.

1086
01:50:52,821 --> 01:50:55,596
I saw him die, my mother as well.

1087
01:50:55,638 --> 01:50:57,298
Bones left...

1088
01:50:57,343 --> 01:51:00,012
for the vultures.

1089
01:51:00,057 --> 01:51:03,841
- But you managed to escape.
- To my sorrow.

1090
01:51:03,883 --> 01:51:07,181
Suppose I could arrange for you
to take revenge?

1091
01:51:07,223 --> 01:51:10,105
- How?
- By killing their king.

1092
01:51:11,886 --> 01:51:14,388
Attila himself? How is it possible?

1093
01:51:14,425 --> 01:51:17,758
My question first.
If it were possible, would you do it?

1094
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:22,426
- Yes, I would do it.
- Even if it meant your own death?

1095
01:51:23,888 --> 01:51:28,538
I would enter hell rejoicing if
I could send Attila there before me.

1096
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:36,821
We will assemble
in the courtyard in one hour.

1097
01:51:36,865 --> 01:51:41,313
Today we minister to the poor
in St Catherine's parish.

1098
01:51:50,990 --> 01:51:55,094
You hate this place as much as I do.
I can see it in your eyes.

1099
01:51:55,129 --> 01:51:58,391
What if I do?
I'm trapped here just as you are.

1100
01:51:58,434 --> 01:52:00,202
You're wrong.

1101
01:52:00,279 --> 01:52:02,675
Do you have friends on the outside?

1102
01:52:02,714 --> 01:52:06,747
I've written a note.
Have it delivered with this ring.

1103
01:52:08,629 --> 01:52:12,211
Take it and the ring
to prove the letter comes from me.

1104
01:52:12,872 --> 01:52:15,992
Have your friend deliver these
to the man I name

1105
01:52:16,039 --> 01:52:18,221
and you and I will be free forever.

1106
01:52:18,265 --> 01:52:23,436
- What man?
- Attila, King of the Huns.

1107
01:52:28,563 --> 01:52:32,003
We conquer cities, we rule the world,

1108
01:52:32,041 --> 01:52:35,267
and yet, we can't even build a bath.

1109
01:52:35,312 --> 01:52:37,673
There's a more pressing matter.

1110
01:52:37,712 --> 01:52:40,488
The Eastern emperor
has hired an assassin.

1111
01:52:40,531 --> 01:52:43,033
- I want a bath like in Rome.
- Majesty...

1112
01:52:43,071 --> 01:52:46,440
Our spies bring this rumor
every week.

1113
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,389
This rumor has substance.

1114
01:52:48,428 --> 01:52:51,524
- There are so many foreigners.
- Including you.

1115
01:52:51,559 --> 01:52:53,635
Or have you forgotten?

1116
01:52:53,681 --> 01:52:56,278
I trust I've proved my loyalty, sire.

1117
01:52:56,325 --> 01:52:58,401
So you have.

1118
01:52:58,448 --> 01:53:00,524
Many times.

1119
01:53:02,761 --> 01:53:04,220
(Sighs )

1120
01:53:04,258 --> 01:53:09,263
Orestes, if it is my destiny to die,
I will die.

1121
01:53:09,302 --> 01:53:14,794
- If not, no assassin can harm me.
- Still, I ask you to be prudent.

1122
01:53:14,833 --> 01:53:17,751
And I ask you,
why is this bath not finished?

1123
01:53:17,791 --> 01:53:20,638
The marble has to be brought
a thousand leagues,

1124
01:53:20,678 --> 01:53:22,825
the pipes angled and the furnace...

1125
01:53:22,870 --> 01:53:24,815
Enough.

1126
01:53:24,853 --> 01:53:28,815
- You have three days.
- Three days? But sire.

1127
01:53:28,854 --> 01:53:31,771
Yes, Great King, of course,
three days.

1128
01:53:43,396 --> 01:53:46,622
- That's Attila?
- Yes.

1129
01:53:47,989 --> 01:53:51,951
Try to keep the hatred
out of your eyes when you meet him.

1130
01:54:20,065 --> 01:54:22,046
(Choking)

1131
01:54:24,761 --> 01:54:26,837
Your name is Lygus.

1132
01:54:26,884 --> 01:54:30,490
You were sent by Theodosius,
Emperor of the East.

1133
01:54:30,572 --> 01:54:32,825
Is that not so?

1134
01:54:49,915 --> 01:54:51,302
(Yells)

1135
01:54:51,342 --> 01:54:53,418
(Groans )

1136
01:55:01,465 --> 01:55:03,374
Orestes!

1137
01:55:06,441 --> 01:55:09,395
You were supposed to call
when he showed himself.

1138
01:55:09,432 --> 01:55:13,038
- (Attila ) There was no need.
- I'll have him crucified.

1139
01:55:13,086 --> 01:55:17,427
He's a brave man
and loyal to his master.

1140
01:55:18,513 --> 01:55:20,944
- Send him back safely.
- Sire...

1141
01:55:22,026 --> 01:55:25,431
- How much was he to be paid?
- 50lbs in gold.

1142
01:55:25,470 --> 01:55:29,290
(Attila ) Place the sum in a sack,
hang it from his neck,

1143
01:55:29,332 --> 01:55:31,621
and let him return wearing it.

1144
01:55:35,699 --> 01:55:37,775
The emperor will be humiliated.

1145
01:55:37,821 --> 01:55:42,376
The blame lies with him
for giving the order, not this man.

1146
01:55:42,414 --> 01:55:47,276
There may be other attempts, sire.
Rome has spies throughout the city.

1147
01:55:49,058 --> 01:55:51,834
It's not my fate to be assassinated.

1148
01:55:51,877 --> 01:55:56,562
There are slaves, merchants, even
mercenaries who sell information.

1149
01:55:56,607 --> 01:56:01,649
Today a peddler asked my servant
your pretext for invading the West.

1150
01:56:06,245 --> 01:56:10,551
I'll find work near the bath,
sell myself as a slave if I have to.

1151
01:56:10,594 --> 01:56:12,919
Sooner or later, he'll notice me.

1152
01:56:13,863 --> 01:56:15,939
He will not be what you expect.

1153
01:56:17,725 --> 01:56:21,829
The other woman's village
was destroyed the same as yours.

1154
01:56:21,866 --> 01:56:25,828
She too began by hating him,
but her hatred turned to love.

1155
01:56:25,866 --> 01:56:28,499
Then she was weak.

1156
01:56:28,545 --> 01:56:31,462
(Horses neighing)

1157
01:56:50,811 --> 01:56:53,313
Is this the man you spoke of?

1158
01:56:53,350 --> 01:56:55,426
- Yes.
- Take him.

1159
01:57:06,988 --> 01:57:09,526
Kneel before the King of the Huns.

1160
01:57:11,615 --> 01:57:13,691
Leave us.

1161
01:57:17,738 --> 01:57:22,293
About an hour ago, a plot to kill me
failed. Were you part of it?

1162
01:57:22,331 --> 01:57:24,383
If I were, you'd be dead.

1163
01:57:26,748 --> 01:57:31,434
Yet you come disguised as a peasant.
Why not openly, as a friend?

1164
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:35,442
To see what I wish to see,
not what you wish to show me.

1165
01:57:35,481 --> 01:57:36,512
And?

1166
01:57:38,265 --> 01:57:40,317
You've done well.

1167
01:57:43,622 --> 01:57:48,972
The lands I rule are as vast
as both your empires put together.

1168
01:57:51,589 --> 01:57:56,108
There's more to empires than land.
Where are the Forums?

1169
01:57:56,146 --> 01:57:58,364
The Colosseums? The great Circus?

1170
01:57:58,408 --> 01:58:00,696
Theatres? Aqueducts?

1171
01:58:00,739 --> 01:58:02,992
Give us time, Aetius.

1172
01:58:03,035 --> 01:58:06,510
It took Rome centuries
to become what it is.

1173
01:58:08,671 --> 01:58:12,799
And what happens to us
while you're learning?

1174
01:58:12,845 --> 01:58:17,116
- Do we sink into chaos and ruin?
- Only if you resist us.

1175
01:58:20,743 --> 01:58:24,253
Civilized men are easy to conquer,

1176
01:58:24,292 --> 01:58:26,368
but civilization...

1177
01:58:27,179 --> 01:58:30,204
still belongs to the civilized,
not the barbarians.

1178
01:58:30,241 --> 01:58:33,575
It belongs to whoever
is strong enough to take it.

1179
01:58:37,964 --> 01:58:40,253
Aetius, join me.

1180
01:58:41,965 --> 01:58:44,847
Once, you invited me to Rome.

1181
01:58:44,887 --> 01:58:47,877
You said we could
do great things together.

1182
01:58:47,914 --> 01:58:49,823
We still can.

1183
01:58:49,862 --> 01:58:52,459
Only now I invite you to stay here.

1184
01:58:52,506 --> 01:58:54,582
To serve you?

1185
01:58:54,629 --> 01:58:58,212
I'm a better man
than the emperors you serve now.

1186
01:58:59,325 --> 01:59:01,472
I serve Rome.

1187
01:59:15,363 --> 01:59:19,432
Speak frankly. Do you plan
to attack the Western Empire?

1188
01:59:19,468 --> 01:59:21,793
I have no such plans at the moment.

1189
01:59:22,705 --> 01:59:24,543
But in the future?

1190
01:59:24,583 --> 01:59:27,287
No one can tell the future.

1191
01:59:27,331 --> 01:59:30,391
Let's strike a bargain here and now.

1192
01:59:30,428 --> 01:59:35,019
A treaty of peace
between your people and mine.

1193
01:59:35,055 --> 01:59:38,945
I think that's the first sign
of weakness I've ever seen you show.

1194
01:59:44,066 --> 01:59:45,868
Will you make the treaty?

1195
01:59:47,684 --> 01:59:53,175
Empires expand until someone
is strong enough to stop them.

1196
01:59:53,215 --> 01:59:57,105
So it was with Rome, so with us.

1197
01:59:57,147 --> 02:00:00,337
And so it will be
as long as men walk the earth.

1198
02:00:00,382 --> 02:00:02,814
Then our business here is done.

1199
02:00:04,696 --> 02:00:06,569
So it seems.

1200
02:00:58,169 --> 02:01:00,113
Well done, Orestes.

1201
02:01:00,152 --> 02:01:04,707
I will use it tonight.
Bring my wives.

1202
02:01:04,744 --> 02:01:07,413
Which ones, Your Majesty?

1203
02:01:08,710 --> 02:01:10,406
All of them.

1204
02:01:10,449 --> 02:01:13,022
It's the only way to avoid a fight.

1205
02:01:14,276 --> 02:01:16,220
Yes, Your Majesty.

1206
02:01:28,470 --> 02:01:30,130
Majesty?

1207
02:01:31,358 --> 02:01:34,027
That girl, who is she?

1208
02:01:34,802 --> 02:01:38,100
- A slave.
- How long has she been here?

1209
02:01:38,142 --> 02:01:39,874
Where is she from?

1210
02:01:39,917 --> 02:01:42,621
Newly arrived.
I don't know where she's from.

1211
02:01:42,665 --> 02:01:45,168
- I can find out.
- Yes.

1212
02:01:46,283 --> 02:01:51,004
Find out everything about her,
and bring her to me tonight.

1213
02:01:51,049 --> 02:01:53,718
But your wives, Majesty,
and the bath.

1214
02:01:53,763 --> 02:01:56,016
Tell them it's not finished.

1215
02:01:56,059 --> 02:02:00,472
Spare their feelings,
but tell them...whatever you wish.

1216
02:02:17,003 --> 02:02:18,735
Come closer.

1217
02:02:29,109 --> 02:02:31,363
Don't be afraid.

1218
02:02:35,476 --> 02:02:37,552
I won't hurt you.

1219
02:02:53,463 --> 02:02:55,372
What are you frightened of?

1220
02:02:55,411 --> 02:03:00,487
Among my people,
a woman who is taken before marriage

1221
02:03:00,525 --> 02:03:02,328
is dishonored forever.

1222
02:03:02,369 --> 02:03:04,386
You won't be dishonored.

1223
02:03:04,421 --> 02:03:07,576
Why else do kings
bring slaves to their quarters?

1224
02:03:07,622 --> 02:03:10,777
You won't be dishonored. I swear it.

1225
02:03:15,728 --> 02:03:17,804
Your name is Ilidico,

1226
02:03:18,755 --> 02:03:20,831
from a village to the north?

1227
02:03:20,878 --> 02:03:24,981
- My village was destroyed.
- And your family?

1228
02:03:25,017 --> 02:03:28,077
- Killed.
- I'm sorry.

1229
02:03:29,506 --> 02:03:31,866
Those things happen in war.

1230
02:03:33,645 --> 02:03:38,651
But whatever can be done
for your comfort will be done.

1231
02:03:38,689 --> 02:03:40,563
Why?

1232
02:03:42,308 --> 02:03:45,534
- You please me.
- You don't even know me.

1233
02:03:47,910 --> 02:03:50,235
But I will come to know you...

1234
02:03:52,153 --> 02:03:54,300
and you will come to know me.

1235
02:03:57,024 --> 02:03:59,100
As you wish, Great King.

1236
02:04:01,304 --> 02:04:06,475
When my village was destroyed,
I stayed in the forest for days.

1237
02:04:06,522 --> 02:04:08,598
Finally, I came to a road,

1238
02:04:08,644 --> 02:04:11,942
and the next day,
some travelers took me in.

1239
02:04:11,984 --> 02:04:14,272
I will have them rewarded.

1240
02:04:14,315 --> 02:04:18,657
They were killed by robbers,
but I was lucky again and escaped.

1241
02:04:20,543 --> 02:04:23,568
It wasn't luck
that brought you here.

1242
02:04:25,065 --> 02:04:28,469
The gods work in mysterious ways.

1243
02:04:28,510 --> 02:04:33,337
They take with one hand
and give back with the other.

1244
02:04:34,388 --> 02:04:36,464
I don't understand.

1245
02:04:39,224 --> 02:04:42,865
- Are you still frightened of me?
- Great King, I...

1246
02:04:42,912 --> 02:04:45,023
Call me by my name.

1247
02:04:46,391 --> 02:04:50,804
- Is it permitted?
- I command it.

1248
02:04:51,923 --> 02:04:56,027
Then, no,
I'm not still frightened of you...

1249
02:04:57,037 --> 02:04:58,911
Attila.

1250
02:05:09,179 --> 02:05:13,033
News from Pannonia.
Attila is getting married again.

1251
02:05:13,075 --> 02:05:14,664
- Is he?
- Yes.

1252
02:05:14,710 --> 02:05:18,008
To some slave girl
who suddenly took his fancy.

1253
02:05:18,051 --> 02:05:22,119
I suppose, in addition to the fortune
he already extracts from me,

1254
02:05:22,156 --> 02:05:25,311
I shall be expected
to send a royal wedding present.

1255
02:05:25,357 --> 02:05:28,310
That's what you get
for trying to kill him.

1256
02:05:28,348 --> 02:05:32,025
Why don't you stop being so smug
and form a plan of your own?

1257
02:05:32,070 --> 02:05:35,616
- That's what you're here for.
- I did form a plan.

1258
02:05:35,654 --> 02:05:39,200
And I have every reason to
believe that Attila's marriage

1259
02:05:39,238 --> 02:05:42,464
may not turn out
to be an entirely happy one.

1260
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:57,359
Gods of my father, curse this root,
and make it deadly.

1261
02:05:57,398 --> 02:06:00,102
And curse he who drinks it.

1262
02:06:01,121 --> 02:06:06,400
And give me the strength to hate
till my father's death is avenged.

1263
02:06:14,654 --> 02:06:17,085
Your Majesty, Lord Orestes.

1264
02:06:17,124 --> 02:06:20,350
- What is it?
- A message from Constantinople.

1265
02:06:20,394 --> 02:06:22,577
- From the emperor?
- No, my lord,

1266
02:06:22,621 --> 02:06:26,262
- a Roman princess named Honoria.
- This is her ring.

1267
02:06:26,308 --> 02:06:28,360
She wore it often.

1268
02:06:30,205 --> 02:06:31,734
Read it.

1269
02:06:31,771 --> 02:06:36,397
She says she's being held prisoner
on her brother's orders.

1270
02:06:36,433 --> 02:06:39,244
If you rescue her, she'll marry you.

1271
02:06:42,173 --> 02:06:44,984
I have no need of another wife.

1272
02:06:45,025 --> 02:06:49,058
She promises, as her dowry,
one half of the Western Empire.

1273
02:06:50,558 --> 02:06:52,254
There is my pretext.

1274
02:06:52,297 --> 02:06:54,657
She has no right to half the empire.

1275
02:06:54,697 --> 02:06:57,437
Perhaps you should consult a lawyer.

1276
02:06:57,481 --> 02:07:00,363
Attila is already
gathering his forces.

1277
02:07:00,402 --> 02:07:02,691
The wedding to the slave girl?

1278
02:07:02,734 --> 02:07:04,537
Postponed indefinitely.

1279
02:07:04,577 --> 02:07:08,088
All nations north of the Rhine
are to join the Huns

1280
02:07:08,126 --> 02:07:12,195
in a mighty crusade against
the wicked forces of the West.

1281
02:07:12,231 --> 02:07:14,936
Then we must present a united front.

1282
02:07:14,980 --> 02:07:18,135
Attila has hammered us long enough.

1283
02:07:18,181 --> 02:07:21,063
It's your turn now, Flavius Aetius.

1284
02:07:21,103 --> 02:07:24,852
I'm sending Honoria
back to Rome on the next ship,

1285
02:07:24,896 --> 02:07:27,777
and I wish you the best of luck.

1286
02:07:29,243 --> 02:07:33,134
He marches on Rome within the month.

1287
02:07:43,751 --> 02:07:47,392
I've neglected you
for the past few days.

1288
02:07:47,439 --> 02:07:50,108
I apologize.
There was much to be done.

1289
02:07:50,153 --> 02:07:54,910
They tell me you're going to war
to rescue a Roman princess.

1290
02:07:56,171 --> 02:07:58,709
I will probably never even meet her.

1291
02:07:58,745 --> 02:08:01,557
But it's given me
a reason to invade Rome.

1292
02:08:01,598 --> 02:08:03,816
And our wedding?

1293
02:08:04,834 --> 02:08:07,858
It will have to be postponed
until I return.

1294
02:08:08,591 --> 02:08:10,667
Several months at least.

1295
02:08:13,427 --> 02:08:16,060
And if I am not here
when you return?

1296
02:08:20,212 --> 02:08:24,031
I will tell my servants
you are free to leave at any time.

1297
02:08:25,256 --> 02:08:26,679
Wait.

1298
02:08:27,761 --> 02:08:31,366
I've displeased you.
We could marry before you leave.

1299
02:08:31,414 --> 02:08:35,542
My weddings are state affairs,
for royalty from many nations.

1300
02:08:35,589 --> 02:08:37,665
There is no time.

1301
02:08:40,529 --> 02:08:42,782
I thought I was the one in a hurry.

1302
02:08:45,921 --> 02:08:47,973
Perhaps I've changed.

1303
02:08:53,505 --> 02:08:55,557
I'm glad.

1304
02:08:56,636 --> 02:08:58,545
May I speak freely?

1305
02:08:59,629 --> 02:09:01,704
You may.

1306
02:09:02,968 --> 02:09:06,372
I've been told of another woman,
named N'Kara.

1307
02:09:08,605 --> 02:09:10,681
My first wife.

1308
02:09:10,727 --> 02:09:12,838
She died giving birth.

1309
02:09:15,110 --> 02:09:17,399
They say I'm of her very likeness.

1310
02:09:17,441 --> 02:09:20,561
You resemble her closely, yes.

1311
02:09:20,607 --> 02:09:22,932
Then who is it you marry?

1312
02:09:22,973 --> 02:09:25,677
Me or N'Kara?

1313
02:09:29,618 --> 02:09:32,287
If I had wanted nothing
but her likeness,

1314
02:09:32,332 --> 02:09:34,408
I would have taken you by now.

1315
02:09:34,453 --> 02:09:36,398
But I haven't, have I?

1316
02:09:37,480 --> 02:09:38,939
No.

1317
02:09:42,316 --> 02:09:46,385
Then wait until I return,
and you, not N'Kara,

1318
02:09:46,421 --> 02:09:48,603
will be queen of the world.

1319
02:10:30,709 --> 02:10:32,785
(Cheering)

1320
02:10:59,898 --> 02:11:01,974
(Yelling)

1321
02:11:16,284 --> 02:11:17,944
(Roaring)

1322
02:11:21,989 --> 02:11:23,614
(Screaming)

1323
02:11:34,932 --> 02:11:36,141
(Screams )

1324
02:11:44,081 --> 02:11:45,813
Battering ram!

1325
02:11:48,743 --> 02:11:50,272
(Screams )

1326
02:12:09,304 --> 02:12:11,593
(All yelling)

1327
02:12:39,259 --> 02:12:45,131
He's taken 30 cities in Gaul. Some
surrendered, some were destroyed.

1328
02:12:45,173 --> 02:12:48,992
- While we did nothing.
- They weren't necessary to us.

1329
02:12:49,035 --> 02:12:52,474
- Nevertheless, they were Roman.
- I understand your distress,

1330
02:12:52,513 --> 02:12:58,705
but in a crisis, that which is
unnecessary must be dispensed with.

1331
02:12:59,750 --> 02:13:04,578
Attila's carving a path wide enough
to protect him, but no further.

1332
02:13:04,620 --> 02:13:08,261
Clearly, he intends
to press on further west.

1333
02:13:08,308 --> 02:13:11,190
If he wants to conquer Rome,

1334
02:13:11,231 --> 02:13:14,077
why doesn't he
march south into Italy?

1335
02:13:14,118 --> 02:13:17,629
Then the free tribes of Gaul
might threaten his rear.

1336
02:13:17,667 --> 02:13:20,264
So he plans to conquer Gaul first?

1337
02:13:20,310 --> 02:13:22,386
As I would in his place.

1338
02:13:22,433 --> 02:13:24,509
Then where do we stop him?

1339
02:13:29,182 --> 02:13:33,903
Here, at Orleans.
He cannot afford to bypass the city.

1340
02:13:33,948 --> 02:13:36,095
He must be near there already.

1341
02:13:36,140 --> 02:13:39,745
- The siege began two days ago.
- We should send troops.

1342
02:13:39,793 --> 02:13:42,426
(Aetius ) I sent them some time ago.

1343
02:13:42,472 --> 02:13:46,743
- The city can hold for months.
- And then?

1344
02:13:47,795 --> 02:13:50,120
500 leagues from his base,

1345
02:13:50,161 --> 02:13:53,529
with winter coming on,
he'll have to withdraw.

1346
02:13:53,570 --> 02:13:56,974
- He'll be back next year.
- By which time, other plans of mine

1347
02:13:57,014 --> 02:13:58,888
will have taken effect.

1348
02:13:58,927 --> 02:14:05,250
Flavius Aetius, once again,
you have done Rome a great service.

1349
02:14:10,444 --> 02:14:12,388
What if Orleans falls?

1350
02:14:12,427 --> 02:14:14,609
I'm confident that it won't.

1351
02:14:14,653 --> 02:14:17,155
You should have a contingency plan,

1352
02:14:17,193 --> 02:14:20,217
and it should be
an alliance with the Visigoths.

1353
02:14:20,254 --> 02:14:24,417
- Theodoric wouldn't consider it.
- He might, at the right price.

1354
02:14:24,464 --> 02:14:27,061
She's his daughter, Aetius.

1355
02:14:27,107 --> 02:14:29,645
Can't blame him for wanting her back.

1356
02:14:29,683 --> 02:14:31,865
She's my child in every way.

1357
02:14:31,909 --> 02:14:33,890
Except by blood.

1358
02:14:33,926 --> 02:14:36,951
The fact of which
she is completely ignorant.

1359
02:14:36,989 --> 02:14:40,951
Whoever enlightens her dies.

1360
02:14:40,989 --> 02:14:43,492
I wouldn't meddle in family affairs,

1361
02:14:43,528 --> 02:14:47,870
but you always talk about
making sacrifices for the empire.

1362
02:14:47,913 --> 02:14:52,918
That sacrifice is not necessary,
because we don't need Theodoric.

1363
02:14:52,957 --> 02:14:56,503
Attila will be stopped at Orleans.

1364
02:14:58,454 --> 02:15:00,530
(Screaming)

1365
02:15:00,576 --> 02:15:03,909
Get those ladders back up - now!

1366
02:15:03,951 --> 02:15:06,691
(Confused shouting)

1367
02:15:22,076 --> 02:15:24,093
Move in there!

1368
02:15:25,276 --> 02:15:27,672
Bring the battering ram!

1369
02:16:34,266 --> 02:16:39,129
Train all the catapults at this
point, to the right of the gate.

1370
02:16:40,250 --> 02:16:42,326
It is done.

1371
02:16:50,269 --> 02:16:51,858
(Man ) Clear!

1372
02:16:51,904 --> 02:16:53,327
Pull!

1373
02:17:06,898 --> 02:17:10,825
Your Majesty.
Everything is in position.

1374
02:17:15,944 --> 02:17:17,604
Pull!

1375
02:17:18,693 --> 02:17:20,151
Pull.

1376
02:17:27,355 --> 02:17:28,423
Clear!

1377
02:17:28,469 --> 02:17:30,450
Pull.

1378
02:17:31,913 --> 02:17:33,537
Pull!

1379
02:17:35,357 --> 02:17:36,744
Pull!

1380
02:17:38,557 --> 02:17:39,873
Pull!

1381
02:17:48,752 --> 02:17:50,139
Pull!

1382
02:17:55,118 --> 02:17:56,506
Pull!

1383
02:18:02,841 --> 02:18:04,229
Pull!

1384
02:18:29,873 --> 02:18:32,162
- You are certain?
- Yes, my lord.

1385
02:18:32,204 --> 02:18:35,502
- I saw it with my own eyes.
- The troops?

1386
02:18:35,544 --> 02:18:39,648
- Those who survived were executed.
- The population?

1387
02:18:39,683 --> 02:18:43,266
Enslaved, and every building
burned to the ground.

1388
02:18:44,902 --> 02:18:46,776
Leave me.

1389
02:19:02,889 --> 02:19:04,763
(Giggling)

1390
02:19:05,986 --> 02:19:08,132
I think he loves me, Father,

1391
02:19:08,177 --> 02:19:10,715
even if he hasn't said so yet.

1392
02:19:10,752 --> 02:19:12,210
Who?

1393
02:19:12,248 --> 02:19:15,273
Livius. Who else?

1394
02:19:15,309 --> 02:19:18,263
Oh, yes, of course.

1395
02:19:19,344 --> 02:19:21,420
What's wrong?

1396
02:19:22,998 --> 02:19:26,924
- Attila's taken Orleans.
- You said that wouldn't happen.

1397
02:19:26,964 --> 02:19:29,040
It seems I was mistaken.

1398
02:19:30,408 --> 02:19:32,519
What will you do?

1399
02:19:32,565 --> 02:19:34,926
Take a journey to Gaul.

1400
02:19:37,852 --> 02:19:40,178
I'd like you to come.

1401
02:19:40,218 --> 02:19:43,029
Now? Just when Livius is...

1402
02:19:45,332 --> 02:19:47,621
If you think you'll need me.

1403
02:19:49,333 --> 02:19:53,046
- I think I might.
- I'll make ready.

1404
02:20:05,267 --> 02:20:07,628
(Valentinian ) Mmm...

1405
02:20:07,668 --> 02:20:09,744
(Laughing)

1406
02:20:23,150 --> 02:20:24,988
What's she doing here?

1407
02:20:25,029 --> 02:20:27,246
Take her back to prison at once.

1408
02:20:27,289 --> 02:20:31,287
- Valentinian, she's your sister.
- Well, tell her that.

1409
02:20:31,325 --> 02:20:35,287
She plots against me,
then offers my empire to barbarians.

1410
02:20:35,326 --> 02:20:38,172
She's come to beg your forgiveness.

1411
02:20:38,214 --> 02:20:40,290
Haven't you, Honoria?

1412
02:20:43,537 --> 02:20:46,242
As your sister and loyal subject,

1413
02:20:46,285 --> 02:20:48,503
I humbly beg your forgiveness.

1414
02:20:49,347 --> 02:20:51,220
I'm touched!

1415
02:20:51,260 --> 02:20:53,442
- I told you!
- Honoria, please.

1416
02:20:53,487 --> 02:20:55,848
You can't keep her locked up forever.

1417
02:20:55,887 --> 02:20:57,725
Can't I? We'll see.

1418
02:20:57,766 --> 02:21:01,550
- Guards, take her back to her cell!
- Valentinian...

1419
02:21:01,593 --> 02:21:03,669
Mother!

1420
02:21:05,002 --> 02:21:06,662
Tell me, Mother.

1421
02:21:06,707 --> 02:21:11,642
How can you be so concerned for one
child and so unfeeling to the other?

1422
02:21:11,681 --> 02:21:15,430
- What are you talking about?
- Let's stop pretending.

1423
02:21:15,474 --> 02:21:19,328
Your attempt to have me killed
in the Garden of Corona.

1424
02:21:19,370 --> 02:21:23,154
You thought I didn't know.
I've known since it happened.

1425
02:21:23,198 --> 02:21:26,911
- You're mad.
- If not for Aetius, I'd have died.

1426
02:21:26,954 --> 02:21:29,659
- The assassin carried your seal.
- Impossible.

1427
02:21:29,703 --> 02:21:31,612
I saw it myself.

1428
02:21:31,651 --> 02:21:37,452
Since you became emperor I've only
given my seal to one person.

1429
02:21:37,496 --> 02:21:39,049
Aetius.

1430
02:21:47,133 --> 02:21:51,475
(Aetius ) He's three days' march
from here and moving quickly.

1431
02:21:51,516 --> 02:21:54,814
(Theodoric) I'll withdraw
into the mountains,

1432
02:21:54,856 --> 02:21:58,640
or perhaps I'll join his army,
leaving you to stand alone.

1433
02:21:58,684 --> 02:22:00,901
Then you would be his servant.

1434
02:22:00,945 --> 02:22:03,198
I would also see Rome crushed.

1435
02:22:03,241 --> 02:22:06,195
I think I would enjoy that very much.

1436
02:22:07,868 --> 02:22:11,795
You and I have fought over land,
but we've also shared it.

1437
02:22:11,834 --> 02:22:15,416
We fought over religion,
but we're both Christian.

1438
02:22:15,452 --> 02:22:18,405
This isn't just
you and me against Attila.

1439
02:22:18,444 --> 02:22:21,113
It's our world against his world.

1440
02:22:25,263 --> 02:22:27,445
Name your terms.

1441
02:22:28,533 --> 02:22:30,821
My men to fight under my banner.

1442
02:22:32,395 --> 02:22:34,411
You and I to command jointly.

1443
02:22:37,822 --> 02:22:40,182
You will return my daughter to me.

1444
02:22:45,093 --> 02:22:48,771
- Ask for something else.
- I want my daughter.

1445
02:22:48,816 --> 02:22:53,122
She doesn't know she's your daughter.
She's lived as a Roman.

1446
02:22:53,165 --> 02:22:57,055
Without me as an ally,
there will be no Rome.

1447
02:23:03,289 --> 02:23:04,913
Hello, Father.

1448
02:23:08,298 --> 02:23:10,030
Who's this?

1449
02:23:13,586 --> 02:23:15,733
Father? Father?

1450
02:23:17,378 --> 02:23:18,837
Father!

1451
02:23:19,083 --> 02:23:20,921
Father...!

1452
02:23:22,388 --> 02:23:28,082
She'll be taken over the mountains
to Spain. You'll never see her again.

1453
02:23:32,338 --> 02:23:36,502
And now you know what it is
to have your child stolen from you.

1454
02:23:40,758 --> 02:23:42,810
Gather your army.

1455
02:23:43,889 --> 02:23:49,131
- We must withdraw at first light.
- And leave my villages unprotected?

1456
02:23:50,324 --> 02:23:52,471
Burn the villages.

1457
02:23:52,516 --> 02:23:55,470
Burn the crops.
Burn anything that doesn't travel.

1458
02:23:55,508 --> 02:24:01,178
Attila commands many nations,
but his best troops are still Huns.

1459
02:24:01,214 --> 02:24:03,432
If we take away his horses...

1460
02:24:04,519 --> 02:24:06,595
we can win.

1461
02:24:13,390 --> 02:24:15,466
Galen...

1462
02:24:16,521 --> 02:24:19,368
I used to make fun of your visions,

1463
02:24:21,984 --> 02:24:24,060
but I wish you were here now.

1464
02:24:32,873 --> 02:24:34,949
God of war,

1465
02:24:36,804 --> 02:24:42,083
you once gave me this sword
as a token of your favor.

1466
02:24:44,632 --> 02:24:49,804
When I've been in need,
you've guided me by sending a sign.

1467
02:24:58,757 --> 02:25:01,189
If I am still your chosen one,

1468
02:25:02,271 --> 02:25:05,011
if it is my destiny
to rule the world,

1469
02:25:07,907 --> 02:25:10,303
send me a sign now.

1470
02:25:17,334 --> 02:25:19,410
Send me a sign!

1471
02:25:33,268 --> 02:25:36,258
Your Majesty,
we were concerned about you.

1472
02:25:36,295 --> 02:25:39,936
- What's happened?
- Aetius has stopped retreating.

1473
02:25:39,983 --> 02:25:44,431
He takes position ten leagues away,
by a village called Shalom.

1474
02:25:47,359 --> 02:25:51,700
I thought the war gods refused me
a sign, but I was wrong.

1475
02:25:52,856 --> 02:25:56,295
What better sign than
an enemy prepared to fight?

1476
02:26:23,262 --> 02:26:27,888
Visigoths, the land
we fight on belongs to you.

1477
02:26:29,732 --> 02:26:32,306
Fight well, or it belongs to Attila.

1478
02:26:33,352 --> 02:26:36,447
Your wives and daughters
will be his slaves.

1479
02:26:39,822 --> 02:26:43,606
Romans, you too
fight for your country.

1480
02:26:43,649 --> 02:26:46,354
For if we fail,
Attila will march on Rome,

1481
02:26:46,397 --> 02:26:48,686
and there's no one to oppose him.

1482
02:26:48,729 --> 02:26:51,267
Remember your ancestors.

1483
02:26:52,347 --> 02:26:54,600
Add their strength to yours,

1484
02:26:55,686 --> 02:26:59,327
or a flame that has lit the lives
of men for a thousand years

1485
02:26:59,374 --> 02:27:02,399
will perish from the earth!

1486
02:27:02,436 --> 02:27:06,813
(Attila ) They retreat,
burn their own fields,

1487
02:27:06,854 --> 02:27:09,736
choose their ground with care.

1488
02:27:09,776 --> 02:27:13,524
They use tricks
because they are weak!

1489
02:27:14,682 --> 02:27:17,979
We are strong and so they fear us.

1490
02:27:19,169 --> 02:27:22,847
Huns, it's enough to remind you

1491
02:27:22,893 --> 02:27:26,819
that we've fought many battles
and never been defeated.

1492
02:27:27,797 --> 02:27:32,210
To you nations and tribes
who fight alongside us,

1493
02:27:32,250 --> 02:27:35,512
I say you are Huns in spirit!

1494
02:27:36,391 --> 02:27:38,229
You are invincible.

1495
02:28:11,633 --> 02:28:14,823
There is no retreat
from this place, Valorus.

1496
02:28:14,868 --> 02:28:17,406
We must hold this hill at all costs.

1497
02:28:17,443 --> 02:28:21,476
All is set, my lord.
They'll never make it up the hill.

1498
02:28:36,577 --> 02:28:38,938
It's marshland and they've dug pits.

1499
02:28:38,979 --> 02:28:40,923
We'll proceed on foot.

1500
02:28:40,961 --> 02:28:43,178
Dismount!

1501
02:28:43,222 --> 02:28:46,247
Archers to the front! All-out attack!

1502
02:28:46,284 --> 02:28:48,396
(Yelling)

1503
02:29:35,269 --> 02:29:37,522
Send a reserve unit to the line.

1504
02:29:37,565 --> 02:29:40,376
Second Cohort, forward!

1505
02:29:57,465 --> 02:29:59,054
Orestes!

1506
02:30:00,770 --> 02:30:04,874
- Orestes, fall back!
- Fall back! Fall back!

1507
02:30:12,981 --> 02:30:14,854
Fall back!

1508
02:30:19,835 --> 02:30:21,946
(Men moaning)

1509
02:30:33,055 --> 02:30:35,071
It's well entrenched, sir.

1510
02:30:35,108 --> 02:30:37,848
Keep half the company in reserve.

1511
02:30:37,891 --> 02:30:41,224
Send the other half
to aid against the Visigoths.

1512
02:30:42,378 --> 02:30:45,119
- On the flank?
- Yes.

1513
02:30:46,240 --> 02:30:50,404
Aetius will have to weaken
his position to reinforce them.

1514
02:30:50,485 --> 02:30:52,774
And when we does, we'll attack him.

1515
02:30:52,815 --> 02:30:54,891
Yes, sire.

1516
02:30:59,286 --> 02:30:59,973
Forward!

1517
02:31:01,339 --> 02:31:03,451
(Yelling)

1518
02:31:07,636 --> 02:31:09,712
It is done, sire.

1519
02:31:27,814 --> 02:31:30,484
They're attacking the Visigoths.

1520
02:31:35,956 --> 02:31:38,387
Hold this hill!

1521
02:31:46,531 --> 02:31:50,695
Reinforcement! Flank attack!
More men now!

1522
02:31:52,759 --> 02:31:55,950
Let me have three cohorts
to lend support.

1523
02:31:58,430 --> 02:32:00,506
General, we'll be outflanked.

1524
02:32:00,552 --> 02:32:04,371
- It could be a diversion.
- It's an all-out attack.

1525
02:32:04,414 --> 02:32:06,358
Why isn't Attila leading it?

1526
02:32:09,667 --> 02:32:11,683
General, I beg you.

1527
02:32:15,408 --> 02:32:18,362
- Take them.
- Third Cohort with me.

1528
02:32:43,309 --> 02:32:46,370
It's working, sire.
They've weakened their center.

1529
02:32:46,405 --> 02:32:49,287
Bring up the reserves.

1530
02:32:49,328 --> 02:32:51,439
Reserves to the front!

1531
02:33:59,464 --> 02:34:01,338
We'll never hold.

1532
02:34:01,377 --> 02:34:03,774
Forgive me. I should have stayed.

1533
02:34:03,813 --> 02:34:07,419
- I commanded. The blame is mine.
- You can still escape.

1534
02:34:10,006 --> 02:34:11,879
No.

1535
02:34:13,172 --> 02:34:17,134
I gave the only thing I love
to save Rome.

1536
02:34:17,173 --> 02:34:19,249
Now I've lost Rome, too.

1537
02:34:20,999 --> 02:34:23,075
I'll die here.

1538
02:34:24,479 --> 02:34:26,839
But I give you one last order.

1539
02:34:26,879 --> 02:34:29,584
- Kill Theodoric.
- Yes, General.

1540
02:35:41,052 --> 02:35:43,234
All legions...

1541
02:35:44,844 --> 02:35:46,920
to the front.

1542
02:35:53,924 --> 02:35:56,000
The King is dead!

1543
02:36:02,795 --> 02:36:04,871
Charge!

1544
02:37:33,633 --> 02:37:35,436
(Yells)

1545
02:37:36,729 --> 02:37:39,089
Sire, we must retreat!

1546
02:37:40,172 --> 02:37:42,046
No.

1547
02:37:42,782 --> 02:37:45,285
We're pressed on all sides!

1548
02:37:52,732 --> 02:37:55,128
All to us, here, now!

1549
02:38:10,301 --> 02:38:14,014
Valorus, you were magnificent.

1550
02:38:14,059 --> 02:38:18,258
The Visigoths assumed
the arrow came from the Huns,

1551
02:38:18,303 --> 02:38:20,805
took revenge,
and won the day for us.

1552
02:38:20,842 --> 02:38:25,290
Never let it be said
that God is without humor.

1553
02:38:26,409 --> 02:38:29,078
God has more humor than you think.

1554
02:38:29,122 --> 02:38:31,375
The Visigoths are leaving camp.

1555
02:38:33,297 --> 02:38:36,595
(Aetius )
Your father never would have left.

1556
02:38:36,638 --> 02:38:39,520
My father is dead
and I must look to my crown.

1557
02:38:39,559 --> 02:38:41,884
My brothers will start plotting.

1558
02:38:41,925 --> 02:38:46,124
- What difference can a day make?
- Enough, if spent fighting.

1559
02:38:46,170 --> 02:38:49,396
I'd lose good men,
needed against my brothers.

1560
02:38:49,440 --> 02:38:52,808
After the battle, I'll join you
against your brothers.

1561
02:38:54,519 --> 02:38:56,631
I won't owe my throne to a Roman.

1562
02:38:56,677 --> 02:39:00,081
I leave in the morning.
The decision is final.

1563
02:39:10,940 --> 02:39:14,202
The Romans have taken up
a defensive position.

1564
02:39:17,237 --> 02:39:19,739
- And the Visigoths?
- Gone.

1565
02:39:19,777 --> 02:39:24,011
Perhaps they mourn Theodoric or
they've quarreled with the Romans.

1566
02:39:24,056 --> 02:39:28,018
In any event, we face Aetius only.
He can't attack alone.

1567
02:39:28,753 --> 02:39:31,458
Nor are we strong enough
to attack him.

1568
02:39:31,501 --> 02:39:35,605
Then we can withdraw in good order
and return in the spring.

1569
02:39:36,685 --> 02:39:38,487
So it seems.

1570
02:39:38,529 --> 02:39:43,392
In that case, Your Majesty, may I
take the liberty of offering a gift?

1571
02:39:43,435 --> 02:39:45,379
A gift?

1572
02:39:45,417 --> 02:39:49,201
This morning I sent men to
the place where the sword broke.

1573
02:39:49,244 --> 02:39:52,020
They found these fragments.

1574
02:39:52,862 --> 02:39:56,860
There are smiths in Scythia who can
reforge this as strongly as ever,

1575
02:39:56,898 --> 02:39:58,974
if you will allow it.

1576
02:40:00,411 --> 02:40:03,187
- I will allow it.
- You see, Majesty,

1577
02:40:03,230 --> 02:40:07,263
your destiny has not ended,
it merely makes a new beginning.

1578
02:40:57,015 --> 02:41:00,656
Aetius, your wisdom and valor

1579
02:41:00,703 --> 02:41:04,249
have once again saved Rome
from the greatest peril.

1580
02:41:06,026 --> 02:41:09,631
Accept this laurel
from your grateful nation

1581
02:41:10,792 --> 02:41:12,381
and from your emperor.

1582
02:42:35,576 --> 02:42:37,652
(Clapping and chanting)

1583
02:43:37,328 --> 02:43:40,424
Orestes, we're retiring.

1584
02:43:40,460 --> 02:43:43,377
See that the guests
have everything they need.

1585
02:43:43,417 --> 02:43:45,148
Yes, Your Majesty.

1586
02:43:45,191 --> 02:43:48,631
And may I offer you
my heartfelt congratulations?

1587
02:43:48,670 --> 02:43:50,887
You're a loyal servant, Orestes,

1588
02:43:50,931 --> 02:43:54,572
and one of the few men
I've ever counted as a friend.

1589
02:45:30,222 --> 02:45:32,582
Come, N'Kara.

1590
02:45:33,979 --> 02:45:35,639
It's time.

1591
02:46:20,703 --> 02:46:22,921
In my country, we have a custom.

1592
02:46:22,963 --> 02:46:26,926
The bride and groom have one last
toast before the wedding bed.

1593
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:28,802
Is it permitted?

1594
02:46:30,131 --> 02:46:31,755
Of course.

1595
02:47:15,010 --> 02:47:17,512
(Choking)

1596
02:47:18,489 --> 02:47:19,948
Attila?

1597
02:47:19,984 --> 02:47:23,045
(Groaning)

1598
02:47:36,093 --> 02:47:38,074
(Panting)

1599
02:47:46,530 --> 02:47:48,403
N'Kara...

1600
02:48:19,685 --> 02:48:21,559
Great King?

1601
02:48:25,147 --> 02:48:27,222
Great King?

1602
02:48:30,609 --> 02:48:32,685
Your Majesty?

1603
02:49:26,759 --> 02:49:28,704
Dead.

1604
02:49:29,996 --> 02:49:32,498
(Laughing)

1605
02:50:38,671 --> 02:50:41,588
(All wailing)

1606
02:50:55,927 --> 02:50:58,144
You wish to see me, Majesty?

1607
02:50:58,188 --> 02:51:01,866
Yes. We're celebrating
the death of Attila.

1608
02:51:01,911 --> 02:51:04,651
Naturally,
we wished you to be present.

1609
02:51:04,694 --> 02:51:06,948
I'm flattered.

1610
02:51:06,990 --> 02:51:11,890
Is there any chance,
I wonder, of finding his grave?

1611
02:51:13,844 --> 02:51:15,647
It's doubtful, sire.

1612
02:51:15,687 --> 02:51:19,958
The slaves who buried him will have
been killed to keep it secret.

1613
02:51:20,002 --> 02:51:22,777
It's an old Hun custom.

1614
02:51:22,820 --> 02:51:28,134
It's a pity. I had hopes of
displaying his head in the Forum.

1615
02:51:28,177 --> 02:51:31,368
No doubt, that explains the custom.

1616
02:51:31,413 --> 02:51:35,825
At any rate, it appears
that your work is finished.

1617
02:51:35,866 --> 02:51:39,412
You were set free
to deal with Attila,

1618
02:51:40,597 --> 02:51:42,673
and you've dealt with him.

1619
02:51:55,905 --> 02:52:01,396
You said, "Anything that isn't
necessary must be dispensed with."

1620
02:52:02,794 --> 02:52:04,870
And with Attila gone...

1621
02:52:05,995 --> 02:52:08,070
you're no longer necessary.

1622
02:52:46,803 --> 02:52:51,251
(Narrator) 'With Attila dead,
there was no one capable of uniting

1623
02:52:51,291 --> 02:52:54,624
'the various nations
outside Rome's borders.

1624
02:52:54,666 --> 02:52:59,114
'With Aetius dead, there was
no one capable of protecting Rome.

1625
02:52:59,154 --> 02:53:02,795
'Within a generation,
the Western Empire fell,

1626
02:53:02,841 --> 02:53:06,317
'and the centuries of chaos
known as the Dark Ages

1627
02:53:06,355 --> 02:53:09,024
'descended on the Western world.'
