1
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,560
Halt. Look down.

2
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,400
Keep walking.

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,000
Inquiry Prison of the Ministry for State Security.

4
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,360
Address him as Captain.

5
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:40,920
Come in.

6
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,600
Sit down.

7
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,760
Hands under your thighs,
palms down.

8
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,360
What do you have to tell us?

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,640
I haven't done anything.

10
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,880
I don't know anything.

11
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,040
You've done nothing,
know nothing.

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,800
So you think we just
arrest innocent citizens on a whim?

13
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,880
No, not...

14
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,000
If you think our humane system
is capable of something like that,

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,200
...that'd be reason enough
to arrest you.

16
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,400
We want to jog your memory,
Prisoner 227:

17
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,600
Your friend and neighbor
fled the Republic on September 28th.

18
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,320
And we have reason to believe
he was helped.

19
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,960
I don't know anything about it.

20
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,400
He never told me, he wanted to leave.
I first heard about it at work.

21
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,280
Describe what you did
on the 28th of September.

22
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,960
- That's already on record.
- Once more please.

23
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,840
I took my kids to the park for a walk,

24
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,280
...ran into an old classmate
there, Max Kirchner,

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,560
...went to his place and
listened to music into the evening.

26
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,120
He has a phone. You can call him.
He'll corroborate everything.

27
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,720
<i>I can gladly give you the number.</i>

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,120
The enemy of our State is arrogant.

29
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,760
Remember that.

30
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,320
We have to be patient with him, some 40 hours of patience.

31
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,840
I'll fast forward some.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,400
I want to sleep.

33
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,040
Please let me sleep.

34
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,240
Hands under your thighs.

35
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,662
Please explain again
what you did on September 28th.

36
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,280
Please, just an hour, just a little...
just a little sleep...

37
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,760
<i>Tell me again what you did on this day.</i>

38
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,080
Why did you have to keep him
awake for so long?

39
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,960
I mean, that's inhumane.

40
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,160
An innocent prisoner becomes angrier
every hour he is kept there,

41
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,200
...because of the injustice done to him.

42
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,600
He screams and rants.

43
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,000
A guilty one becomes quieter,
says nothing...

44
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,640
...or starts to cry.

45
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,080
He knows that he rightly sits there.

46
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,640
If you want to know
whether someone is guilty or not,

47
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,800
...the best way is to keep asking
until they no longer can.

48
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,120
<i>...classmate Max Kirchner.</i>

49
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,480
We went to his place

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,680
...and listened to music into the evening.

51
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,800
He has a phone.
You can call him.

52
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,920
He'll corroborate everything.

53
00:03:44,513 --> 00:03:46,880
Anyone notice anything
about this statement?

54
00:03:48,004 --> 00:03:49,760
He says pretty much
the same thing.

55
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,520
He says exactly the same thing,
word for word.

56
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,080
Those who tell the truth
can paraphrase whenever.

57
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,400
Do that as well.

58
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,360
A liar has particular sentences to fall back on
during states of increased stress.

59
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,800
227 is lying. We have 2 important indications,
and can increase the intensity.

60
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,740
If you don't tell me the name of the escapee's helper,
your wife will be arrested tonight...

61
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,320
..and your kids put into
a state reformatory.

62
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
Is that what you want?

63
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,840
What's the helper's name?
Who was it?

64
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,440
- Glaesker.
- Come again, louder.

65
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,600
Glaesker. Werner Glaesker.

66
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,640
Werner...Glaesker.

67
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
Quiet.

68
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,880
Quiet!

69
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,480
Listen.

70
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,160
Can anyone tell me
what that is?

71
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,134
The preserved scent for the dogs.

72
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,320
It's to be removed after every interrogation,
and never left behind.

73
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,320
With interrogation, you are working
with enemies of Socialism.

74
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,880
Don't forget that.
Have a nice day.

75
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,000
That was good!
That was really good.

76
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,600
How was it,

77
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,000
...when we sat here together 20 years ago?

78
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,739
Ya know, they proposed me
for a professor job.

79
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,600
See, grades don't matter in the real world,
even though mine weren't too bad.

80
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,480
What's on your agenda?

81
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,400
Why do you always think
I have a hidden agenda?

82
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,560
- I just wanted to invite you to the theater.
- The theater?

83
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,200
I heard that Minister Bruno Hempf
is going to be there tonight.

84
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,800
I ought to attend
as head of the Culture Department.

85
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,680
It starts at 7.
We should get going.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The Lives of Others

87
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,280
Minister Bruno Hempf,
1 o'clock.

88
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,400
He worked for the Ministry,
before he was called into the Central committee.

89
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,440
Cleaned house in those
days with the theater scene.

90
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,320
Georg Dreyman, the poet.

91
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,040
He's the kind of arrogant guy
I always warn my students about.

92
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,800
Arrogant, but loyal.

93
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,560
If everyone were like him,
I'd be jobless.

94
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,000
He's our only unsuspicious author
and is still read in the West.

95
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,560
For him, the GDR is the best
country in the world.

96
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,760
See for yourself.

97
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,520
Dear child, what's wrong?
A new vision?

98
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,160
Say something, Martha! Please!

99
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,560
Your Arthur...

100
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,920
...no longer lives.

101
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,000
Arthur? Isn't it possible
you're wrong this time?

102
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,000
No sisters, believe me.

103
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
He has fallen into death.

104
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,080
The powerful wheel has ground him up.

105
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,280
I see it,

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
...and would rather see any other horror.

107
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,880
Why am I not spared from this vision?

108
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,440
Elena, go home.

109
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,400
And, did you like it?
Dreyman's good, huh?

110
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,280
I would have him monitored.

111
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,680
Monitored? That teaching is
corrupting your instincts, Wiesler.

112
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,549
I'd even be the point man.

113
00:08:58,786 --> 00:09:01,684
I told you he's cleaner than clean.
Even Hempf came to his premiere.

114
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,200
If you monitor someone like that,
you bite the hand that feeds.

115
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,960
I'm going downstairs for a sec.

116
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,480
"Faces of Love"

117
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,400
I'm hearing a lot about your work.
They say, "our culture is in good hands".

118
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,600
Your name is mentioned
often in the party.

119
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,920
We're "the shield and
sword of the party", Minister

120
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,800
We're conscious of that every moment.

121
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,200
What do you think of him?

122
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Georg Dreyman?

123
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,480
Maybe...

124
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,080
Maybe what?

125
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,240
Maybe he's not...not as clean as it seems.

126
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,960
Grubitz, that's why guys like you
and me are at the top.

127
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:24,920
The standard Stasi schmuck would've said:
he's one of our country's best, loyal, all this garbage

128
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,600
...but we see more.

129
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
You could make it up the ladder, Grubitz.

130
00:10:32,368 --> 00:10:36,520
There's something fishy about him.
I feel it in my gut, and it doesn't lie.

131
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,560
Next week Thursday is a party at Dreyman's.

132
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,760
A few shady people are coming,
Hauser and those vermin.

133
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,400
Try and organize something by then,

134
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,754
...something small and discreet,
procedures A and B.

135
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,080
Just his apartment, nothing flashy.
He has powerful friends.

136
00:10:56,703 --> 00:11:01,240
No one can find out about this
until we've found something.

137
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,000
And when you find something against him,
you've got a fat friend in the Central committee.

138
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
Know what I mean?

139
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,160
Minister, have a good evening.

140
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,160
Why's he still watching?

141
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:44,978
What's he even doing here?

142
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,160
I think, he fancies you.

143
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:09,120
I insist on proposing the toast tonight
to our community of culture.

144
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:16,000
A famous Socialist once said:
"The poet is the engineer of the soul."

145
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And Georg Dreyman is one of the most
important engineers in our country.

146
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,200
- Charming comrades.
- Paul! Stop that.

147
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,200
And of course Christa-Maria Sieland.
She is the most beautiful pearl of the GDR.

148
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,180
I won't accept any objections to that.

149
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,000
So, please raise your glasses and toast
to Christa-Maria Sieland. May you live long!

150
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,280
- The fact, someone like that can even address you...
- Please, stay here.

151
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,600
<i>And now another lively number.</i>

152
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,680
May I?

153
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,400
- How did you like my little speech?
- Thank you very much.

154
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
I liked your play as well.

155
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,920
Really, it was good.

156
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,720
"Engineer of the soul".
That was Stalin you quoted.

157
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,560
Oh yeah?

158
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,160
Well, I like to provoke
every now and then, Hauser.

159
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,920
But on the other hand,
I know how far I can take that.

160
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,000
In that way, I'm more like
our dear Dreyman.

161
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,160
He knows that the party needs the artist,
but the artist the party even more.

162
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,880
If you guys want to talk politics,
I need to find someone else to dance with.

163
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,640
- I'm ready.
- Too late, too late.

164
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,599
I've been following the developments
of our theater for a while.

165
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:49,360
- Didn't you follow them professionally before?
- Paul!

166
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,560
It's fine Herr Dreyman.
We've known each other for a long time.

167
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,920
Herr Schweiber.

168
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,920
You did a fine job tonight as well.

169
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,960
Dreyman, I'm glad you're
working with such directors now.

170
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,680
There were other times though...

171
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,680
You mean Jerska?

172
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,000
I think you sentenced him too harshly.

173
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,640
Of course. His statement
crossed the line. No question.

174
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,400
But...

175
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,000
...put yourself in his position for a minute,
you as a man of your word.

176
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,800
He can't take back his signature
from this declaration.

177
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,000
Comrade Hempf, the man could
work at any theater in the West.

178
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,000
But he doesn't want to leave,
because he firmly believes in Socialism and this country.

179
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,720
- His career ban is absolute...
- Who said anything about a career ban?

180
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,120
That doesn't exist here.
You ought to choose your words more carefully.

181
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,100
Comrade Hempf, I'll tell you this now:

182
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,200
My plays aren't so good,
that someone like Schweiber could direct them.

183
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,000
I need Jerska.

184
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,400
- And I think you sentenced him too hard...
- See here. I don't think so.

185
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,760
But that's what we all love about your plays.
The love of man, good people,

186
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,600
...believing that someone can change.

187
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,400
Dreyman...

188
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,400
...no matter how often
you write that in your plays,

189
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,600
...people don't change.

190
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,154
So how's he doing anyway?

191
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:29,896
He was hoping that his career b...

192
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,280
...that he'd be allowed to work again soon.

193
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,120
- Can he hope?
- Of course. As long as he's alive, and even longer.

194
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,040
As you know Dreyman,
"Hope is the last thing to die".

195
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,600
The Tech. Team will be ready
tomorrow morning for the wiretapping.

196
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,000
It's important that everything's done by Thursday.
It's all up to you.

197
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,600
Can you manage that?

198
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,320
Good night.

199
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,200
Need to go.
Otherwise, I'll get in trouble.

200
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,880
- By who?
- My girlfriend.

201
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,240
20 minutes.

202
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:38,920
Yes?

203
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,920
Frau Meineke, one word to anyone...

204
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,960
...and your Marscha loses
her acceptance to medical school.

205
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Is that understood?

206
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,000
Yeah.

207
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,440
Send Frau Meineke a thank-you gift
for her secrecy.

208
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,720
Thursday already.

209
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,200
Time goes by too fast.
It's better so.

210
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,760
- How're you doing?
- Not too bad.

211
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,833
It's not always this noisy.

212
00:22:41,314 --> 00:22:42,394
I know, just on Thursdays.

213
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,680
Yeah.

214
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,680
- We missed you at the premiere.
- Schweiber have a good epiphany?

215
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,240
- What was good, he stole from you.
- That's how my ideas stay alive.

216
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:15,000
Don't think me evil, but I can't stand
the sight of these fat, spiffed up people at such a premiere.

217
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,200
That doesn't sound like me, does it?

218
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,440
But maybe it does after all.
Maybe that wasn't the real me back then

219
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,400
...friendly and kind to people
off the concentrated feed of success,

220
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,440
...for which I'm indebted
to the big shots for their mercy.

221
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,600
But I'll stop complaining.

222
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:48,840
In my next life I want to be a writer,
a happy writer who can write all the time.

223
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,640
Like you.

224
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,320
What does a director have
if he's not allowed to direct?

225
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,600
Nothing more than a projectionist without films,
a miller without flour. He has nothing left.

226
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,800
Nothing left...

227
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,600
Albert, the Minister was at
the premiere too. Minister Hempf.

228
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,920
I talked to him about your ban.

229
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,600
It's looking good.

230
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,760
He gave me some hope,
was very literal, very specific.

231
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,560
Really?

232
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,760
That's nice.

233
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:28,040
Jerska, the wine connoisseur.
And how's our sacred drinker doing? Is he coming?

234
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,920
I forgot to ask him.

235
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,640
You're vigorous and strong.
And I need you.

236
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,800
- Don't bring this destructive cycle into your life.
- Albert's my friend.

237
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,440
- And you're mine too.
- Looks like something for a 50th birthday party.

238
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,760
I'm turning 40 though, aren't I?

239
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,040
Don't forget. You promised to wear
a tie for your birthday.

240
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,200
I would, but I don't have one.

241
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,280
No more excuse.

242
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,560
- A tie?
- You did say, you didn't want any books.

243
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,520
Or can't you tie one after all,
you old working poet?

244
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,080
Ya think, I can't tie a tie?

245
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,760
I was born with a tie.

246
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,120
You forget, I had to break free
of this chain of the middle class.

247
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,200
Then chain yourself to it just once more for me.

248
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,480
Tying a tie.

249
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,000
A minor detail.

250
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,280
Frau Meineke,
come here for a second.

251
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,560
Can you tie a tie?

252
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
You can't imagine
how grateful I am.

253
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,920
- Something wrong?
- No, I'm fine.

254
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,640
Done?

255
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,440
Wonderful! It's perfect.
Couldn't be better.

256
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,680
But this has to be our secret.
You can keep a secret, can't you?

257
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,280
Yes.

258
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,440
Gosh! I really didn't
think you could do it.

259
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,400
You don't beat around the bush
when it comes to what you can do.

260
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,040
You just didn't know
I can do almost anything.

261
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,800
<i>Our first guest.</i>

262
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,640
Our dear good neighbors
locked the door downstairs.

263
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,600
- Can you go?
- On my way.

264
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,800
Master? Our present.

265
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,360
I specifically said, no books. Thank you.

266
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,360
Want something to drink?

267
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,360
- Sure. A seltzer.
- Vodka for me.

268
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,200
I'll get it.

269
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,440
What the hell.
Why's Albert sitting by himself?

270
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,240
He doesn't want to talk to us.
He just turned us away.

271
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,200
I brought you something too.

272
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,400
- Did you really come here to read?
- It's Brecht anyway.

273
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,600
I feel like an impostor
amongst all these people.

274
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,760
Impostor? Come on Albert.
You're losing grip on reality.

275
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,600
You know we admire you.
Every one admires you.

276
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,440
Yeah, for something I did
10 years ago...

277
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,680
...and probably could never do again.

278
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,520
Ah. My favorite director.
Wait a sec, I need to talk to you.

279
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,320
Man, explain to me exactly
how you got this job.

280
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,000
Your talent, naturally. Of course!

281
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,200
But what else did you do? Hm?

282
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,960
Every one knows,
you're with the Stasi, you washout.

283
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,400
- That's an unbelievable allegation.
- Don't forget that...

284
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,800
- Paul!
- What?

285
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,160
Schweiber, excuse my friend.
He's had too much to drink.

286
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,480
What's with you?
You know he's with the Stasi.

287
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,080
No, Paul.
I don't know that.

288
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,840
You're such a miserable idealist,
you're almost some big shot.

289
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,989
Who do you think messed up Jerska so bad?
People like that.

290
00:31:17,014 --> 00:31:18,800
Narks, traitors and conformers.

291
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,000
You have to pick a side sometime,
otherwise you're not a person.

292
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,120
If you want to do something about it, then call me.
Otherwise we don't need to see each other anymore.

293
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,000
- Your friends don't have much taste, do they?
- That's really unfair.

294
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,240
The back scratcher, for example.
It's wonderful.

295
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,360
That's a salad fork.

296
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,680
Never the less.
Wonderful.

297
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,400
Check this out.
I'll write my next play with this.

298
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
You don't have any taste either.

299
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,680
For some things I do.

300
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,080
- From Jerska.
- Probably gave you a book.

301
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:51,280
"The Sonata of Good Men"

302
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:19,080
11:04 pm: "Lazlo" and CMS unwrapped gifts.
Afterwards prob. sexual intercourse.

303
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,400
You're late.

304
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:29,480
Excuse me, Captain. I got stuck at a red light,
can easily lose 4 minutes there.

305
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,120
You know how it is.

306
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:45,400
Already at it, eh? I don't believe it.
These artists! They've got it going on.

307
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,960
Ya know colleague, that's why I
monitor artists instead of priests or peacekeepers.

308
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,960
See you tomorrow at 11am.

309
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,400
Albert Jerska, the "Engerling" file.
Wiesler. Systematic as usual.

310
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,440
Take your jacket off.
Let's get some lunch.

311
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,160
<i>"Volleyball game at 7pm tonight."</i>

312
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,460
You haven't been here for a while.
The officer's table is over here.

313
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,240
Socialism has to start somewhere.

314
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:43,040
To your question about the limo
that brought Frau Sieland home the other night...

315
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,920
It's Minister Hempf's car.

316
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:56,399
Wiesler, we're not allowed to record senior comrades.
I deleted the citation from your report.

317
00:34:56,584 --> 00:35:00,545
Next time there's something like this,
report it to me personally, not written.

318
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,240
We're helping our Committee member
get rid of his rival.

319
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,320
In light of this new information,
I don't need to say what that means for my career.

320
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,560
And for yours.

321
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,560
If we do find something.

322
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,320
Is that why we enlisted?
Remember what we swore?

323
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,920
- To be "the shield and sword of the party".
- And what's the party other than its members?

324
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,800
If they've got a lot of influence,
all the better.

325
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,760
<i>I've got a new one.</i>

326
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,200
So, Honecker comes into his office
in the morning

327
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,200
...opens the window, looks at the sun,
and says...

328
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,680
...uh, what's wrong?

329
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,280
Oh excuse me.
That was...I'm just...I...

330
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,360
No, please colleague. We can still
laugh about our state officials. Don't worry.

331
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,240
I probably know it already anyway.

332
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,520
Come on. Tell it.

333
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,480
Well, Honecker,
I mean, the General Secretary

334
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,400
...sees the sun and says:
"Good morning, dear sun."

335
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,400
"Good morning, dear sun."

336
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,040
And the sun answered:
"Good morning, dear Erich."

337
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,320
At noon Erich sees it again
and says: "Good day, dear sun."

338
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,720
And the sun said: "Good day, dear Erich."

339
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,800
After work Honecker goes back to the window
and says: "Good evening, dear sun."

340
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,000
But the sun doesn't answer.

341
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,540
So he says again:
"Good evening, dear sun. What's wrong?"

342
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,600
And the sun answers:
"Oh kiss my ass, I'm in the West now."

343
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:58,760
Name?

344
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,200
Rank?
Department?

345
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,080
Me?

346
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,760
Stiegler.

347
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,135
2nd Lieut. Axel Stiegler.
Department M.

348
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,200
Don't think I need to say what that
means for your career, what you just did.

349
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,200
Please...Lieutenant Colonel...I just...

350
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,300
You just mocked our party.
That was political agitation.

351
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
Surely just the tip of the iceberg.

352
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm going to report this
to the Minister's office.

353
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,487
I was just kidding!
Pretty good, huh?

354
00:37:47,788 --> 00:37:50,502
Your's was good too.
But I've got a better one.

355
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,000
What's the difference between
Erich Honecker and a telephone?

356
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,600
Nothing.
Hang up and try again.

357
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,040
- Hey I gotta go home. See ya!
- Night.

358
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,000
Cold?

359
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,680
Christa, Christa. You forgot about
our date on Thursday.

360
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,680
Or did your poet have
2 birthdays in a row?

361
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Come on.
Get in.

362
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,200
Get in.

363
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,240
You don't know
what's good for you.

364
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,800
Don't worry.

365
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,400
I'll take good care of you.

366
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,800
Don't tell me
you don't need it too.

367
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,800
Just say the word
and I'll let you go right now.

368
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,400
I'm already busy.

369
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,400
Where do you think
I'm taking you to?

370
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,800
I'm taking you him.
You'll get there faster.

371
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,000
Time for some bitter truth.

372
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,200
Yeah?

373
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,080
These idiots.

374
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,080
See you next Thursday.

375
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Drive.

376
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,400
Christa?

377
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,360
Hold me tight.

378
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,640
Evening Captain.

379
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,040
You're 5 minutes late, again.

380
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,120
Good evening. 11th floor.
On the right.

381
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,400
<i>I'm already up here.</i>

382
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,600
- How did you get in the building?
- A few other guys from the Ministry live here.

383
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,800
I don't think I've ever been here before.

384
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,880
I don't think so either.

385
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,200
Was that good?

386
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,920
- Please, stay here a little longer.
- I can't.

387
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,160
I have another customer at 1:30.

388
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,920
I work by appointments.

389
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,400
1:30. You won't make it in time.

390
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,080
<i>Yeah I will.
Don't worry.</i>

391
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,800
Next time, book a longer time.

392
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,800
Bye.

393
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,240
Georg, did you heard about Hauser?

394
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,200
No. What about him?

395
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,520
His lecture tour in the West was cancelled.
He didn't get a travel permit.

396
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,280
Are you surprised?

397
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,080
If he's going to act so arrogant,
he ought to expect something like this to happen.

398
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,520
<i>Would you allow him to travel,
if you were in their shoes?</i>

399
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:42,560
"'Lazlo' supports Hauser's travel abroad ban."

400
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,280
- Have you seen my yellow volume of Brecht?
- What?

401
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,480
My Brecht volume.

402
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,200
Don't know where it is.

403
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,640
Weird. I can't find it.

404
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,200
<i>"On that day in blue-mooned September,
quiet under a young plum tree,"</i>

405
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,200
<i>"I held her there, that silent pale love,
in my arms like a graceful dream."</i>

406
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,800
<i>"And above us in the summer sky,
was a cloud I saw for a time."</i>

407
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:26,200
<i>"On top it was white and tremendous.
And as I looked up, there was not but one sign."</i>

408
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,800
- Yes?
- Georg? This is Wallner.

409
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,360
What is it?

410
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,160
<i>Georg, it's about Jerska.</i>

411
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,560
<i>He's dead.
He hung himself last night.</i>

412
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,440
<i>Georg?</i>

413
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,600
I'm gonna hang up, OK?

414
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,640
I'm thinking about what
Lenin said about Beethoven's "Appassionata".

415
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,680
"I can't listen to it,
otherwise I won't be able to finish the revolution."

416
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,200
Can someone who's
listened to this music

417
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,600
...really listened

418
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,000
...still be a bad person?

419
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,200
Do you really work for the Stasi?

420
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,400
Do you know what that is? The Stasi?

421
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,520
Yes. My dad says they're
bad men who lock people up.

422
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:06,960
I see.

423
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,280
What's the name of your...?

424
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,040
My what?

425
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,320
Your ball.
What's your ball's name?

426
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,800
You're weird.
Balls don't have names.

427
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,400
Everything is happening, Minister.

428
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,400
State-of-the-art technology

429
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,560
...under every light switch,
even in the john.

430
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,800
- The foyer is being monitored per procedure C...
- You said, you'd find something.

431
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Find something already.

432
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,200
I wouldn't want my worst enemy
to disappoint me.

433
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,600
Get out of here.

434
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,080
Nowack, you're going to monitor Christa-Maria.

435
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,000
Report every minute she's not
with me. Understood?

436
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,400
We banned Hauser's travel permit.

437
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,800
Maybe that'll get something going.
Those two are pretty close.

438
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,915
How's it going between
CMS and the Minister?

439
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:21,159
They're meeting tomorrow night,
if I understand their rhythm.

440
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:25,600
Good. The both of us have a lot
to gain from their love story.

441
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,400
Or a lot to lose.

442
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,120
Don't forget that.

443
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,200
In the past,
I was scared of only 2 things:

444
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,800
Being alone and not being able to write.

445
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,280
Since Albert's death,
I don't care about writing.

446
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,600
Or other people.

447
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,040
Now I'm just afraid of being without you.

448
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,800
Don't be scared of losing me tonight.

449
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,520
- I'm just going out for an hour.
- Where?

450
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,640
I'm meeting up with a classmate.

451
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,400
Really Christa?

452
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,120
- Really?
- What are you getting at?

453
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:23,600
I know.

454
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,840
I know where you want to go.

455
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,000
And I'm asking you, don't go.

456
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,600
You don't need him.

457
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,240
You don't need him.

458
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,600
I know about the pills, too.

459
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,360
And how little you trust your art.

460
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,480
At least trust me.

461
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,600
Christa-Maria...

462
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,080
You are a great artist.

463
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,200
I know it.
And your audience knows it too.

464
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,000
You don't need him.

465
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,760
You don't need him.

466
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,600
Stay here.

467
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,560
Don't go to him.

468
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:32,640
No, I don't need him,
don't need this scandalous system.

469
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
What about you?

470
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,880
You don't need it either,
even less than I do.

471
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,800
But you're in bed with him too.
Why?

472
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,720
Because they can destroy you too,
despite your talent you haven't doubted yet.

473
00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:00,120
Because they decide
who can act and direct.

474
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,080
<i>You don't want to end up like Jerska.</i>

475
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,800
<i>And I don't want that either.</i>

476
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,200
<i>And that's why I'm going.</i>

477
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:17,760
<i>You're right about many things.
I want to do things differently.</i>

478
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,080
But I'm asking you.

479
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,080
I'm begging you. Don't go.

480
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,440
So boss. On time?

481
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,400
Lemme guess
what they're up to.

482
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,120
Come on. I'll take over.

483
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,000
I can't be held responsible
for you doing overtime because of me.

484
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,480
"Don't go through this door."
Where's she off to?

485
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,480
Meeting an old schoolmate.

486
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,240
You can read the detailed report tomorrow.

487
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,400
I'll take care of it.

488
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,280
Good night.

489
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,600
What're you staring at?

490
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,680
Seltzer.

491
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,840
No, uh. Vodka.

492
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,040
2 shots.

493
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,240
Another shot.

494
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,360
Bring me a cognac, please.

495
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,800
Ma'am?

496
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,000
Please let me be.
I want to be alone.

497
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,600
Frau Sieland.

498
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,600
Do we know each other?

499
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,120
You don't know me,
but I know you.

500
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,600
A lot of people love you...

501
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,680
...because you are how you are.

502
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:04,920
- Acting isn't real.
- With you it is.

503
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,360
I've seen you on stage.

504
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,240
You were more yourself then, than...

505
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,000
...than how you are now.

506
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,280
So, you know how I am?

507
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,600
I am your audience.

508
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,320
- I have to go.
- Where are you going?

509
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,400
I'm meeting an old schoolmate. I...

510
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,440
You see? You weren't
yourself at all just then.

511
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,013
No?

512
01:01:52,716 --> 01:01:53,356
No.

513
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:10,160
You know this Christa-Maria Sieland well.

514
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:17,880
What do you think?
Would she hurt someone who completely loves her?

515
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,240
Would she sell herself for the art?

516
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,600
Sell herself for art?

517
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:30,560
But she has the art already.
That'd be terrible business.

518
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,880
You are a great artist.

519
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,960
Don't you know that?

520
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,680
And you are a good person.

521
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:26,400
<i>"As I took over, 'Lazlo' and CMS were arguing
about whether CMS should meet her schoolmate."</i>

522
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,440
<i>"Finally she went.
'Lazlo' seemed unhappy about this."</i>

Heavy intimacy ensued."</i>

<i>"He said repeatedly: "I have the strength now.
I will do something."</i>

530
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,760
<i>"What her comment means is uncertain:"</i>

531
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:12,120
<i>"Perhaps she wants to take care

532
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,680
<i>"The rest of the night was peaceful."</i>

533
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:22,000
Captain...
I was just, uh...

534
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,040
Good report.

535
01:04:27,091 --> 01:04:27,891
Really?

536
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,560
I didn't know he was doing so badly.

537
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,520
Me either.

<i>"From someone who's crossed over":
The State's head office for Statistics on Hans Beimler St.</i>

539
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,480
<i>...counts everything, knows everything:</i>

540
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,240
<i>how many shoes I buy per year: 2.3,</i>

541

<i>...how many books I read in a year: 3.2,</i>

542

<i>...and how many students graduate
every year with an 4.0 GPA: 6,347.</i>

543
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,080
<i>But there is one number not registered,</i>

544
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:29,600
<i>...perhaps because such a figure
hurts even the bureaucrats: suicides.</i>

545
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,000
<i>If you called the Beimler St. office and asked,</i>

546

<i>"How many people between the Elbe
and Oder rivers,"</i>

<i>...those grey men who take care
of our country's security and happiness.</i>

552
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,600
<i>Since 1977 our country has ceased
counting cases of suicide.</i>

553

<i>"Murdering oneself".
That's what they call it.</i>

<i>This act has nothing to do with murder.</i>

555

<i>It knows no bloodlust.
It knows no passion.</i>

556
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:13,040
<i>It only knows dying,
the dying of hope.</i>

557
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:19,240
<i>9 years ago, when we stopped counting suicides,
only one European country had a higher suicide rate:</i>

<i>Hungary.</i>

559

<i>After them was us,
the country of the living breathing Socialism.</i>

560

<i>One of these uncounted is Albert Jerska,</i>

561

<i>...the great director.</i>

562

<i>Today, I'd like to talk about him.</i>

563
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,400
I'm trying to get some stats on...

564
01:06:40,801 --> 01:06:45,301
how much more effective our
State's security works, as is generally believed.

565
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,240
Stupid me, I practiced my lecture for the tour here.

566
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,400
Since then I've taken quite a taste in music.

567
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,360
Should we meet at my place?

568
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,360
"3pm, Ehrenmal Pankow"

569
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,440
Is this safe enough?

570
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,200
My own personal bodyguard.
I call him Rolf. That's probably his name too.

571
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,640
I call him Rolf.
That's probably his name too.

572
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,120
Shoot.

573
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:40,760
Here.

574
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:52,760
You want to publish this?

575
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,680
In the West. With your help.
Will you help me?

576
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,760
Have you told Christa about this?

577
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,280
No.

578
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:07,960
Good, I'll help you

579
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:11,480
...under the condition you
continue to keep it a secret.

580
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:12,640
What?

581
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,920
Georg, it's for her protection.

582
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,560
This is something for "der Spiegel" magazine.

583
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:22,000
I'm good friends with one of the directors,
Gregor Hessenstein. You know him?

584
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:24,360
- Not personally.
- You need to meet him.

585
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,320
But publishing under your name
is out of the question.

586
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,320
Unless an intensive
48 hour interrogation sounds appealing.

587
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,560
Man, it's cold.

588
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,200
So, to my place after all?

589
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:42,160
There are no Stasis watching me.

590
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:46,680
May I remind you, I'm a personal friend of
Margot Honecker and a National Prize winner.

591
01:08:46,708 --> 01:08:47,669
2nd class winner.

592
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,160
I'm telling you guys, my place's clean.

593
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:54,560
Well, if we could somehow be sure...

594
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:59,800
I had an idea how we could check your apartment.

595
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:07,720
You guys know my uncle Frank visits every Saturday
from West Berlin with his slick, gold Mercedes.

596
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:10,920
For Herr Hauser,
this seems pretty risky.

597
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,280
Yeah, Georg's right.

598
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,180
Just dismantling the back seat and
hiding your nephew underneath.

599
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,080
I don't know,
I just don't know.

600
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,720
Believe me fellas,
they won't look under there.

601
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:27,520
Quick glance under the axle,
knock on the exhaust pipe and that's it, I'm over, Paul too.

602
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:33,080
They certainly aren't the brightest on the border.
You guys have that all wrong.

603
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:38,720
- Which border crossing are you taking?
- Heinrich-Heine Street.

604
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,480
<i>Always Heinrich-Heine Street.</i>

605
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:46,400
<i>The guys know me there, me and my gold Benz.
I'm good friends with the border patrol.</i>

606
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:51,520
Believe me, I'll call in 2 hours
with a bottle of Schultheiss in hand

607
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,720
<i>...and give you guys the good message:
Paul is over.</i>

608
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,200
What's up with Paul's Stasi-guy?

609
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:04,080
Rolf, Rolfy...
He thinks Pauly's at home.

610
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,040
Alright, I gotta go.

611
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:12,040
Otherwise the boy's gonna suffocate in the car.
Then he'd really be in trouble, wouldn't he?

612
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:28,640
Want another beer?

613
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,240
Checkpoint Heinrich-Heine Street.

614
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:38,920
Subscriber?

615
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:41,520
Subscriber?

616
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,120
Whatever.

617
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,960
Just this once, friend.

618
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,520
- Dreyman.
- OK, as promised, "Paul is over".

619
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:20,520
No checks? Nothing?

620
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:24,960
Naw, nothing out of the ordinary.
Those guys aren't that bad.

621
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:29,840
- So, he's over.
- Thank you for doing this for us.

622
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:34,240
Don't mention it.
It wasn't all that dangerous.

623
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,640
<i>Yeah, I guess not.</i>

624
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,600
- Yeah good, then thank you. See ya.
- Later.

625
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,280
What do we say,
if someone asks what we're doing together?

626
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,960
We'll say...

627
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:05,920
We'll say you're helping me
write a play.

628
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,040
For the 40th anniversary of the GDR.

629
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,320
Yeah.

630
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:12,920
That's sort of right.

631
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:21,240
Who would've thought
our State's security is so inapt.

632
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,640
Who'd of thought such idiots even exist!

633
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,640
Just wait.

634
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:56,640
"7:32pm: No further noteworthy incidents."

635
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,480
Hi captain.
Listen to this for a sec.

636
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,080
<i>For those in the West, we know why the rate
was the highest in '67.</i>

637
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:22,240
But in 1977, you need to explain that,
clarify the social conditions.

638
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,000
It ought to still be a literary piece,
not a journalistic inflammatory pamphlet.

639
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,200
The article is great the way it is.

640
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:32,080
I just want to make sure
that it'll be properly understood on our end.

641
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,080
It's going to create a stir either way.

642
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,640
- That's Hauser.
- Of course that's Hauser.

643
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,520
Then he's not in the Wes...

644
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,520
They're writing a play together.

645
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,920
For the 40th anniversary.

646
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:56,840
Well, it doesn't sound like a play to me.

647
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,120
What does it sound like to you?

648
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,800
I dunno, but not a play.

649
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,640
You think quite a bit, 1st sergeant Leier.

650
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,240
Are you an intellectual?

651
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,720
Me? No. That's not me.

652
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:16,040
Then don't act like one.

653
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:22,040
I chose you for this assignment
for your technical skills, not for asking questions.

654
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,480
Let your superiors do the thinking.

655
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:28,600
Sorry captain, I'll just...uh...

656
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:35,400
Have a good day, uh great day.
Good work. I mean...Good luck with the work.

657
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,480
<i>I can probably rewrite this.</i>

658
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,960
I'll send you then
what we have on the subjects.

659
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,360
Two weeks. Can you handle that?

660
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:53,120
Then I can possibly get it
into the first March issue, maybe even the cover.

661
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:57,200
That's Christa.

662
01:14:59,160 --> 01:14:59,960
Georg?

663
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,080
Christa, this is Gregor Hessenstein.

664
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,960
- Christa Sieland.
- Yes, I know.

665
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:11,360
So what're you guys conspiring to do?

666
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:16,320
Hauser and I wanted to write a play
together for the Republic's 40th anniversary.

667
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:17,520
<i>Written by 2 people?</i>

668
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:20,920
"Der Spiegel" might do a report on it. Maybe.

669
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,720
- And who's playing the main lead?
- We actually wanted to ask you that.

670
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:27,720
Christa, which role would you rather have,
Lenin or his dear old mother?

671
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,120
You can choose.

672
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,360
Well I can see I'm not wanted here.
I'm gonna take a nap.

673
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:43,920
I commend your caution.

674
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:48,920
The less people that know about this project, the better.
The Stasi aren't people you want to trifle with.

675
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:58,080
With that in mind,
I brought you something.

676
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,840
I would've preferred the torte.

677
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:08,120
-I already have a typewriter.
- One that's been documented by the Stasi.

678
01:16:08,519 --> 01:16:11,710
If this text is written with your typewriter
and intercepted at the border,

679
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,820
...then you'll be thrown into
Hohenschoenhausen the next day.

680
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:17,360
And that wouldn't be too swell.
Paul can attest that, huh?

681
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:23,520
Unfortunately all I have in this mini format is red.

682
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,600
That bother you?
Writing the article in red?

683
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,080
Shouldn't be a problem.

684
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,240
You have a place to hide
the typewriter after using it?

685
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,960
- I'm sure I'll come up with something.
- Don't treat this lightly.

686
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:41,440
I don't want the next article to be:
"Where's Georg Dreyman gone to?".

687
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,240
No one other than us knows
this typewriter even exists.

688
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,600
<i>Is the apartment really secure?</i>

689
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:49,640
Yeah.

690
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,480
This apartment is the last place in the GDR,
where I can say what I want unpunished.

691
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:58,600
Good. Then let's drink to that.

692
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,240
The bottle is real.

693
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:09,960
Cheers to you, for showing all of Germany
the true face of the GDR.

694
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,840
<i>Cheers! This is better than the Russian stuff.</i>

695
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,080
<i>Here's to a great success.</i>

696
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,960
I need to see Comrade Grubitz.
It's urgent.

697
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:48,080
I'm sorry, but the earliest available
time is tomorrow at 2:30...

698
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:53,280
If our informant's exposed,
then we'll get rid of the congregation, close the whole church.

699
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,480
It's as simple as that.

700
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,720
He ought to call the Pope
and complain to him.

701
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,960
Now that's enough.
I've had enough of this nonsense.

702
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,840
Wiesler, glad you're here.

703
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:05,720
Gotta show you something.

704
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:13,000
"Terms of Imprisonment for Political/Ideological Dissidents
of the Art Scene, according to Personality Profiles"

705
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,080
Pretty academic, huh?

706
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,200
Check this out.

707
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:23,960
Disseration advised by Professor Anton Grubitz.
How do ya like that?

708
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:31,480
I gave them a B. They shouldn't think that
earning their doctorate is easy with me,

709
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,880
...but this is really great work.

710
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:38,360
Did you know for example
there are only 5 kinds of artists?

711
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:44,640
For example, Dreyman.
He's type 4: Hysterical Anthropocentric.

712
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:47,840
Can't be alone, always has to talk,
have friends around.

713
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:51,600
You wouldn't want to put someone
like this on trial. He'd flourish there.

714
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,520
Everything has to be done by the book, outside the public eye.
We're done with him quicker that way.

715
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:00,080
Complete isolation without telling him
how long he'll be there.

716
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,240
No contact with anyone,
not even with the guards.

717
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:08,240
Best way to deal with him:
no persecution, maltreatment or scandals.

718
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,360
Nothing he could write about later.

719
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:16,160
After 10 months, we let him go.
To his surprise.

720
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,480
Doesn't give us any more trouble.

721
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,080
You know what the best part is?

722
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:26,320
Most of these Type 4s we dealt with
don't write any more,

723
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:29,240
...or paint, or whatever it is artists do.

724
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:33,360
And that's without us pressuring them.
It's just...

725
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,040
...so to speak

726
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,240
...their fate.

727
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,840
What did you want?
Any developments from Dreyman?

728
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:43,960
I wanted to talk to you about that.

729
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,320
I think it's time...

730
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,080
Time for what?

731
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,800
...that we make the operation smaller.

732
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:59,640
I don't think day and night shifts
are required for such an uncertain case.

733
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,240
Uncertain, huh?

734
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,820
So, you don't think we'll find
anything for the Minister?

735
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,360
Maybe if the operation were
smaller and more mobile,

736
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:12,560
...if we could find out some things about "Lazlo"
outside of his apartment.

737
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,880
Should I give Udo the case?

738
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,080
I'd rather take it myself.

739
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,360
Why?

740
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,080
Might still find something.

741
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:29,600
I need to be able to...

742
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:33,600
...come and go as I please
during the day, at night.

743
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,840
Maybe he's doing something
outside his apartment.

744
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,840
Something about this bothers me.

745
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,240
You're not telling me something.

746
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,320
Fine, I'll pull Udo out.

747
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,320
I could actually use him in this church case.

748
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:06,080
File the request with me
in writing,

749
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,840
...and give "lack of suspicious facts"
as your reasoning.

750
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:14,680
And Wiesler?

751
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,080
A piece of advice:

752
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:23,720
We're not in school anymore.
With projects, it's not about grades here,

753
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,240
...but success.

754
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,480
<i>...on Hans Beimler St.
counts everything, knows everything:</i>

755
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,840
<i>how many shoes I buy per year: 2.3,</i>

756
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,240
<i>...how many books I read in a year: 3.2,</i>

757
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:57,120
<i>...and how many students graduate
every year with an 4.0 GPA: 6,347...</i>

758
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:24,520
"5:00pm: 'Lazlo' read the first act of the
anniversary play to Hauser and Wallner."

759
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:58,720
"Dentist office"

760
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:08,720
- We're not writing a play, Christa.
- You don't have to tell me.

761
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:12,640
- But I want to. It's a piece about...
- You don't have to.

762
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,960
Maybe I'm as undependable
as your friends say.

763
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:21,960
I'm on your side.

764
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,160
No matter what.

765
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,680
Strain in the German/German relationship.

766
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:19,760
"Der Spiegel" published a story today
from an unnamed East German writer about suicide in the GDR.

767
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:23,760
It was prompted by a number of suicides
of East-Berlin artists,

768
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:26,960
...the latest, the theater director Albert Jerska.

769
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:33,360
Jerska took his life on Jan. 5th
of this year after a 7-year career ban.

770
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:38,200
Since 1977, the GDR has stopped publishing
its number of suicide cases.

771
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:41,760
<i>In that year, Hungary is the only European
country with a higher number.</i>

772
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:44,840
Yes General, we have...

773
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:47,520
Yes, we have...

774
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:54,120
General, we have an informant at "der Spiegel"
who's obtained a copy of the original article.

775
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,240
<i>- Obtained?! Way to control things.
Who wrote that shit?</i>

776
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,720
He didn't know who the author was either.
Because of the typewriter's font, we can...

777
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,880
<i>- You can't do anything.
Give me names.</i>

778
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,840
General, I will as soon as I find something.

779
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,760
<i>- I hope so.
Otherwise, I'll kill you myself.</i>

780
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:16,720
Andrea, where's the writing expert?

781
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:23,400
In conclusion, the typewriter can only be
a domestic portable typewriter.

782
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:27,120
More than likely, it is a Colibri.

783
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:30,200
If the original had been in black,
I could say for sure.

784
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,720
- And who has a typewriter like that?
- It's hardly used in our Republic.

785
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,480
What's that mean? What's Hauser use, for example?

786
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:42,760
The journalist Paul
uses the Valentino model.

787
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:47,240
- But this model has...
- Yeah, yeah. And Wallner?

788
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,720
Uses a domestic Optimal Elite.

789
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:56,920
- Georg Dreyman?
- He writes the first draft by hand

790
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:01,720
...and the final draft on a Wanderer Torpedo.
He's never written on anything else.

791
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,240
How big would this Colibri typewriter be?

792
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:11,040
It's one of the smallest produced.

793
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:15,000
19.5 x 9 x 19.5 cm

794
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,240
So, not hard to smuggle in as a book?

795
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:22,920
Thank you. You can go.

796
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:28,480
Goodbye, comrade.

797
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:37,840
GDR: The Secret Suicide Statistics

798
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,960
Andrea, put me through to Captain Wiesler.

799
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:53,960
"4:00pm: The group is exhausted
from lots of writing."

800
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,480
- Yes?
- Wiesler, have you heard about this suicide article?

801
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,840
In "der Spiegel", yeah.

802
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:11,360
<i>From where?</i>

803
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,720
Hauser called Dreyman and told him about it.

804
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:21,000
- Wiesler, this is extremely important
for my career and your's:

805
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:26,360
Did he mention anything suspicious?
Or do you have any ideas?

806
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:31,240
I don't believe he mentioned anything.
No he didn't.

807
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:39,240
On the 27th, a "Spiegel" editor using a fake name
crossed the border at Checkpoint Bornholmer St.

808
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:42,240
<i>...and stayed here for 4 hours,
Gregor Hessenstein.</i>

809
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:46,160
<i>The 6th division followed him
to Prenzlauer Berg, then lost him.</i>

810
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,240
<i>Did he have any contact with Dreyman?</i>

811
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:53,240
- Wouldn't I have reported that?
- Yeah, of course.

812
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:58,600
This text has "Poet" written all over it.
I'd be surprised if I'm wrong.

813
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:00,680
Well, keep your ears open.

814
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:09,000
Shit.

815
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,160
Get in.

816
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:44,320
If an employee deceives you,
they're severely punished?

817
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:46,200
Yes, yes they are.

818
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:49,520
A woman too? Or no?

819
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,120
Of course.

820
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:57,480
Shouldn't someone who serves
a bigger man cooperate?

821
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,280
You could say that.

822
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,240
Or maybe you should.

823
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:08,960
This is where Christa-Maria Sieland gets
her illegal antipsychotic drugs.

824
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,480
Thought you ought to know,
it's in your division.

825
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:18,120
Whether you break her neck or not,
I'll leave that up to you.

826
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,960
Either way, I don't ever want to see
her on a German stage again.

827
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,120
Now get out of here.

828
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:35,280
Shut the door!

829
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,960
Frau Sieland, come with us
to clear up this issue.

830
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:45,280
Come on.

831
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:05,520
<i>Well...</i>

832
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:10,480
<i>Comrade Sieland, looks like the end of your career.</i>

833
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:13,800
<i>That's too bad. You were good.</i>

834
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:16,240
Quite good.

835
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,600
A little too short, wasn't it?

836
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:22,360
Have a seat.

837
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:32,720
So what's a non-working actress do?

838
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:38,560
Please.

839
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,120
Isn't there anything I could do for you?

840
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:51,200
- For the State Security?
- It's a little too late for that.

841
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:56,640
I know almost all our artists.
I could find out a lot for you.

842
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:59,960
I believe you
but that won't help you.

843
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:12,960
Maybe there's something else
I could do for you

844
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:17,960
...something that wouldn't be
unpleasant for either of us.

845
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:24,480
Unfortunately you've...
how should I put this?

846
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,760
Made a powerful man your enemy.

847
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:31,240
That's why I'm more restricted than usual.

848
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:36,240
Is there anything that can save me?

849
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,400
I'm sorry. No.

850
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:52,480
There is one thing...

851
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:58,120
...since you hang around
a lot of writers and artists.

852
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:03,960
You don't happen to know anything about
an article that was in last week's "Spiegel"?

853
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:06,160
An article about suicide?

854
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:59,320
<i>State Security. Open the door.</i>

855
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:08,480
Open up!

856
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,720
The light in the study is on.

857
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:18,680
<i>Break the door down
before he destroys the evidence.</i>

858
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,120
Crowbar.

859
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,320
I don't think that's necessary.

860
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,840
- What's wrong comrades?
- We have orders to search your apartment.

861
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:31,160
<i>Here's the warrant.</i>

862
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,320
- What're you looking for?
- Security matter.

863
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:39,800
Bols and Muehler: bedroom, corridors
Reske: kitchen, bathroom, hallways.

864
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:43,240
Heiser and Thomas: living room, study.
Go.

865
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:33,760
What did you burn?

866
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:36,400
Bad texts.

867
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:44,720
This is Western literature, no?

868
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:48,120
That book was a present from Margot Honecker.

869
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:54,320
- What's the situation?
- Everything's going to plan.

870
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:02,960
Nothing. Just some Western books and newspapers.

871
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:07,920
- No sign of the target.
- Were you thorough?

872
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:11,720
<i>Yes sir. How should we proceed?</i>

873
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,240
- Lieut. Colonel?
- Get your men out.

874
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:27,480
Here is the address of the Ministry.
If something's been damaged, you can request compensation.

875
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,280
I'm sure everything's fine.

876
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:53,760
Yes?

877
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:57,240
<i>Wiesler, I'll be expecting you at
Hohenschoenhausen tomorrow at nine.</i>

878
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:05,000
<i>Well, I'll say what we're all thinking.
It was Christa-Maria.</i>

879
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,840
<i>The Stasi nabbed her,
she ratted you out.</i>

880
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:11,600
It wasn't her.

881
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:13,520
How do you know?

882
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:16,960
You said yourself,
she wasn't with you last night.

883
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:22,120
She knows the hiding place.

884
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:25,480
Yeah, she knows.

885
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:35,000
If you're right,
and the search does trace back to her,

886
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:37,720
...then she's our guardian angel.

887
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,040
Meeting Lieut. Colonel Grubitz.

888
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:47,600
Captain Wiesler.

889
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:50,080
Interrogation room #76

890
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:08,320
Yeah?
Come in.

891
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:13,920
Sit down.

892
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:21,800
And?

893
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,440
What was that about?

894
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:29,080
"What was that about?"
You're asking me?!

895
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:33,360
What do you suspect Dreyman to be?

896
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:37,520
He's the writer of the "Spiegel" article.

897
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:43,520
Who says?

898
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:48,080
Come on.

899
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:05,240
I dunno how you could've
done such sloppy work and missed this,

900
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:09,680
...but I know you're different than that,
particularly as an interrogator.

901
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:11,960
So I'm giving you one last chance.

902
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:15,120
Bring me Prisoner 662. Immediately.

903
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:21,760
Are you still on the right side?

904
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:28,680
- Yes.
- Then don't mess it up this time.

905
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,080
Should I restrain the prisoner?

906
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,240
She's not a prisoner, she's an informant now.
You can go.

907
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:06,360
So you're the officer in charge?

908
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,000
Then take charge of me.

909
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:27,320
10 hours left.

910
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,480
9.5 actually...

911
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:36,960
...before Herr Roessing tells the audience,
you're unable to be present due to an illness.

912
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:42,240
And that will be the last time
the theater world talks about you.

913
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:45,240
Is that what you want?

914
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,960
Tell us where the evidence is.

915
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:53,800
There is no evidence.

916
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:57,400
There is no typewriter.
I made that up.

917
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:00,120
I hope not.

918
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:03,720
Then we'll have to keep you here.

919
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:08,720
Perjury carries with it the penalty
of at least 2 years in prison.

920
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:13,480
Dreyman is going to prison either way.

921
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:15,760
Your statement took care of that

922
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:21,720
...along with the evidence we've
already found in the apartment.

923
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:27,480
At least save yourself.

924
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:32,960
You wouldn't believe how many people are here
because of futile heroism.

925
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,280
Think about your audience.

926
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:43,280
"Think about your audience."
He's gotta be joking.

927
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:49,960
Think about what the State's done for you

928
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,440
...your entire life.

929
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:58,240
Now you can do something for the State.
It would thank you.

930
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:03,120
Tell me where the typewriter is.

931
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:07,640
Dreyman will never know.

932
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:10,240
I'll let you go right now.

933
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:13,080
We won't go until you are there with him.

934
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:17,480
You know how to act surprised.

935
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,680
And tonight you'll be back on stage...

936
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:25,520
...in your element

937
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:29,680
...in front of your audience.

938
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,640
Tell me where the documents are.

939
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:52,040
Where are they?

940
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:58,280
In the apartment.

941
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:08,840
Under the door threshold,
between the living room and hallway.

942
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:13,360
You can remove it.

943
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:31,720
You mean here?
Mark the correct spot.

944
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:04,720
You look a bit worn out.
Don't forget, you're an informant now.

945
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:11,720
With that come responsibilities like
conspiring, secrecy, but also privileges.

946
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:34,880
Serhabla.

947
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:37,440
Call Wiesler for me.

948
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:40,120
<i>Captain Wiesler has already left, Lieut. Colonel.</i>

949
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:41,520
I see.

950
01:44:43,948 --> 01:44:45,388
Very good.
You're dismissed.

951
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:03,480
What's a knight do,
when he's thrown off his horse?

952
01:45:03,615 --> 01:45:05,012
He gets back on.

953
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,000
Go in and sleep it off.

954
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:10,240
What happened has nothing
to do with your home situation.

955
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:12,520
No, but with the entire country.

956
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:16,880
Christa?

957
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:20,600
Don't come near me. I was at Karschner's
and there wasn't any water. I need a shower.

958
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:42,240
- You left pretty fast.
- Well, the "Lazlo" case is still going on.

959
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:44,120
- They're both in the apartment?
- Yeah.

960
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:47,320
Today's report.

961
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:51,760
The last report for the "Lazlo" file.

962
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:13,480
Why didn't you call me?

963
01:47:14,858 --> 01:47:15,373
What?

964
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:18,720
Why didn't you call me?

965
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:20,840
I was in the countryside.

966
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:24,800
Hand the nail brush.

967
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:32,840
The Stasi were here,
they searched the apartment.

968
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:35,240
Who was here?

969
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:39,240
<i>State Security, open the door!</i>

970
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:41,040
Stay here.

971
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:52,840
Hello Comrade Dreyman.
Lieut. Colonel. Grubitz from the State Security.

972
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:57,000
Just wanted to make sure
last night's job was neatly carried out.

973
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:59,720
The study? We'll go in there.

974
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,520
Look through every book,
page by page.

975
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:31,720
Well what do we have here?

976
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:36,680
This threshold doesn't look
too kosher to me.

977
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:45,600
Could this be a secret compartment?

978
01:48:58,760 --> 01:49:00,760
Leave her.
She's not a suspect.

979
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:17,720
That actress.

980
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:53,160
I was too weak.
I can never make right what I've done.

981
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:55,680
Nothing needs to be made right.
Understand? Nothing.

982
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:56,800
I have the typewrit...

983
01:50:08,120 --> 01:50:11,720
Forgive me, forgive me...

984
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:45,520
Take your men back to headquarters.
The mission is over.

985
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:04,720
Comrade Dreyman, I called the search off.
We received bad information

986
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:07,040
I'm sorry.

987
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:10,320
Come on.

988
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:10,800
Don't delude yourself, Wiesler.

989
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:13,240
Your career is over...

990
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:17,120
...even if you were smart enough
to cover your tracks.

991
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:22,720
At most you'll be stuck in some cellar hole
opening mail until you're retired.

992
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:25,320
That's in 20 years.

993
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:27,760
20 years.

994
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:30,360
That's a long time.

995
01:52:40,362 --> 01:52:43,773
"Gorbatschow voted General Secretary
of Central Committee"

996
01:52:47,211 --> 01:52:49,691
4 years and 7 months later

997
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:08,240
The Wall is open.

998
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:14,520
The Wall is open.

999
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:24,680
<i>The border patrol's opened the gate.
The elation is overwhelming.</i>

1000
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:27,720
<i>Thousands are storming through.
It's unbelievable</i>

1001
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,880
<i>That's right listeners.
Nov. 9th, 1989 is a historical turning point...</i>

1002
01:53:57,160 --> 01:54:01,600
2 Years Later

1003
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:06,120
Dear child, what's wrong?

1004
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,640
Your Arthur no longer lives.

1005
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:17,840
Arthur? Isn't it possible you're wrong this time?
I saw him just this morning.

1006
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:21,320
No sisters, believe me.
He has fallen.

1007
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:25,499
The faithful men stand around him
as you do me,

1008
01:54:25,942 --> 01:54:32,095
...because of the high sun,
only 7 narrow shadows are cast on his noble, dead body.

1009
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:36,600
The powerful wheel has ground him up.
I see it

1010
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:39,680
...and would rather see any other horror.

1011
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:44,840
Why am I not spared from this vision?

1012
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:50,560
Elena, Go home
and mourn.

1013
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:53,400
I'll finish your shift.

1014
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:04,120
Too many memories, huh?

1015
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:11,040
Same here.
I needed to leave too.

1016
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:15,840
But what about you?

1017
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:18,360
Haven't written since the fall of the Wall.

1018
01:55:20,049 --> 01:55:21,099
That's bad.

1019
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:25,240
After all, our country
invested in you.

1020
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:29,360
But I basically get you, Dreyman.

1021
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:31,720
What's there to write about
in this Federal Republic?

1022
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:36,240
Nothing to believe in any more,
to rebel against.

1023
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:44,160
It was nice in our little Republic.
People understand that now.

1024
01:55:45,560 --> 01:55:49,179
- One thing I have to ask you.
- Anything, dear Dreyman. Anything.

1025
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:51,840
Why wasn't I ever bugged?

1026
01:55:53,720 --> 01:55:56,240
You monitored everyone.
Why not me?

1027
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:03,960
You were completely monitored.

1028
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:06,920
We knew everything about you.

1029
01:56:08,240 --> 01:56:09,720
I was completely monitored?

1030
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:14,240
Completely bugged.
The whole program.

1031
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:16,440
That's impossible.

1032
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:21,760
When you have a chance,
look behind the light switches.

1033
01:56:22,240 --> 01:56:23,440
Knew everything...

1034
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:30,920
We even knew that you couldn't really
give our little Christa what she needed.

1035
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:39,360
To think,
people like you lead my country...

Wait just a moment.

1038
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:04,720
I ordered the folder chronologically.
