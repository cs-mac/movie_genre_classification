The Emigrants

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,955
This is the story of some people
from Ljuder in Småland, Sweden

4
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,675
-who emigrated to North America

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,837
In 1844, Ljuder County had 1925 inhabitants

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,236
the population had tripled in a 100 years

7
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,514
In addition to 254 land-owning farmers

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,310
-there were 39 craftsmen,
92 landless peasants and 11 soldiers

9
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,753
Further, there were 2 7 4 servants,
23 unemployed, 104 paupers,-

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,317
-60 disabled, 5 slow individuals,
3 idiots, 3 whores and 2 thieves.

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,309
Four men controlled the County by power of their
spiritual or secular authority:

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,750
The Priest Brusander, Sheriff Innegren,-

13
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,078
- Lord, Knights and Lieutenant Paul Rudeborg,-

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,671
and the church deacon and merchant Per Persson.

15
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:26,273
It was as in most other Counties at this time.

16
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,913
Everyone must bow down to
the local authorities

17
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,431
-but no authority is without a God.

18
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,519
For what authority there is
has been granted by God.

19
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:00,035
And He who opposes those in authority,
He defies God's will.

20
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,314
And those who oppose the authority will be judged.

21
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,396
For those who have authority do not
strike fear in the hearts of those who do good

22
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,557
-only those who do evil

23
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,435
So, if you do not want to fear authority
you will have to do good

24
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,597
-and you will be rewarded by Him.

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,317
For he is God' servant leading you to good.

26
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,590
Amen.

27
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,436
-Can I have another piece of herring?
-You can't just eat herring

28
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:27,151
-But it tastes good
-She pickled it last week. .

29
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,152
-How long were you a farm hand here dad?
-About twelve years.

30
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:11,436
-But it wasn't in Alarum the whole time?
-No, it wasn't.

31
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,079
- You won't be taking over a Kingdom.

32
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,671
-But there is twice as much land here as
there was 25 years ago.

33
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,116
-If you want to be a farmer you will
need a woman.

34
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,551
- Recon I could get a good one if I wanted

35
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,355
-Don't sit there and brag, boy.

36
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,679
Kristina !

37
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,109
Eat now.

38
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,151
If only I had a horse. . .
but the farm can't feed a horse.

39
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:17,513
Dad has ploughed all the land there is,
yet we don't get any richer.

40
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,998
one should eat ones bread
sprinkled with the sweat of ones face

41
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,513
-Do you have money for the bank?
-we are 22 'Riksdaler' short.

42
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,670
-We could borrow money from Kristina's uncle.
-You can borrow from me.

43
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,910
- I will let Robert know about the cat.
She won't last much longer.

44
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,836
Are you thinking about something?

45
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:35,149
snow for Midsummer. . .
and a lot of it.

46
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,513
-It doesn't look good for the harvest.
-No, it doesn't.

47
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:48,433
When should we sow. If the harvest fails again
this year I don't know what we will do.

48
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,792
-We will put our faith in God.
-Faith. . .

49
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:59,155
If it was enough with faith we could reap a
hundred barrels of wheat this autumn.

50
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,910
We toil as hard as we can. and even so we only
barely make ends meet.

51
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:10,513
After 4 years we have no oxen and we're 70
'riksdaler' deeper in debt.

52
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,189
if only the weather would co-operate,-

53
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,075
-and keep the bounty of the soil from
all kinds of disasters.

54
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,273
bless us with wheat and chaff.

55
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,359
through the power of Jesus Christ,
our lord. Amen.

56
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,678
-Karl Oskar, I don't know. . .
-What's the matter?

57
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:22,069
-I'm thinking of the children.
-They're asleep. All three of them.

58
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,273
I'm thinking of food for the kids.

59
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,552
Food?

60
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,196
I mean, if we abstained, there wouldn't
be even more mouths to feed.

61
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,632
Abstain, for the rest of our lives?

62
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,869
Should we keep apart, for eternity?
I wouldn't be able to.

63
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,869
Not until I get so old that
moss starts sprouting on my ears.

64
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:27,511
why can't you work for your food and clothes.
Your 15 and strong and healthy.

65
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:34,039
-We can't keep you at home any longer.
-You ought to have left long ago.

66
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,234
You ought to be ashamed of your self.
Your sister has been a young lady for years.

67
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,437
What book is that?

68
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,030
Natural sciences
I got it from the Schoolmaster.

69
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,790
For he was a good reader, said Rinaldo.

70
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:04,553
He always said everyone ought to read
the Bible and natural sciences.

71
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,639
It contains everything there is
to know about this world.

72
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:14,437
It talks about the body.
And about the water. Listen to this:

73
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,599
''you can hold a piece of wood or rock
in your hand,''-

74
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,235
-'' but you can't hold water in your hand.''

75
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,353
''for water is liquid and withdraws.''

76
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,393
''all liquid things, such as,
water, beer, milk''-

77
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,150
-''can be dripped, and are called liquids,
because they are liquid.''

78
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:29,719
Ah, look at the boy, yes!
My little boy. .

79
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,628
I couldn't find my way to Nybacken this morning

80
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,837
Stop!

81
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,318
You have earn much harsher punishment,-

82
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,958
-but this time you got away with a slap.

83
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,628
louse.

84
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,069
I'll teach you to speed up!

85
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,512
aren't you going to teach Robert as well, Arvid?

86
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,317
Aren't you and the heifer going to the priest
to announce your engagement?

87
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,399
''strange exotic plants are:''

88
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,674
''sugarcane, which can grow three
bales tall and get thick as an arm''

89
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,995
read that again, the bit about the rice.

90
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,910
''rice is a grain grown in many warmer countries-

91
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,194
-''but the refined grains are carried all the
way to us, and then they're called 'risgryn'.''

92
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,354
''these are boiled with milk to make the
white and delicious rice porridge.''

93
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:51,794
''the best rice comes from the other side of
the ocean, from North-America.''

94
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,519
How wide is the ocean?

95
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:29,319
-It's all the fault of our Lord's weather. .
-Don't blaspheme, Karl Oskar.

96
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:37,429
Can this be called hay?
or is it cat's hair?

97
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,439
If you've taken the rest,
you might as well take this too.

98
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,633
Karl Oskar! You challenge God !

99
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,952
God forgive you for what you have done.
God forgive you, Karl Oskar.

100
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,511
What have you found?

101
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,430
-Are we going to die too?
-Yes, I suppose so.

102
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,559
-When will we die, dad?
-Not for a long time yet.

103
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,718
If we don't get rain soon,
we will have to do without milk.

104
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,470
you remember how many molehills we had last ye

105
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:04,710
-Where did you get that?
-I took some of my pay in spirits.

106
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,679
Aaron said there will be a house change next week.

107
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:22,035
Last year the priest asked me who we call
'our lords'. I couldn't answer.

108
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,359
''our lords are what we call the people, who in
addition to our parents,''-

109
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:33,316
-''have fatherly authority over us, such
as clergy, teachers and landlords.''

110
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:42,115
Do you know how many nobles and landlords
we have above us in this world?

111
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,038
The first is the King, Oskar 1st.

112
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,039
The second is County Chief.
The third is tax collector.

113
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,278
The fourth is sheriff Innegren,
and the fifth is the sheriffs deputy.

114
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:58,793
the sixth is the Priest,
and seventh, Aaron, our landlord.

115
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,994
I have to say. What a mountain of gents!

116
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,956
Do you know it now,
if they should ask you again?

117
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,995
the first is the King. . .

118
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,318
-And what's his name?
-Oskar the 1st.

119
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,398
and then we have. . .

120
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,598
The County Chief.

121
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,794
and then the tax collector after that?

122
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:38,358
-and then it's the priest.
-No.

123
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:49,515
The King, Oskar the 1st,
and then the County Chief. . .

124
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,152
Arvid !

125
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,990
-Are you going to chop wood in the middle of
the night?
-Old mother is going to die tonight.

126
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,112
-Put down the axe.
-I'm going to kill her!

127
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:59,112
-Have you gone insane!
-I'm going to chop her straight in the mouth !

128
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,755
Arvid, listen to me. . .

129
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,229
Don't touch that axe!

130
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:15,718
Listen to me!
Your making yourself miserable.

131
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,517
-You don't know what you're doing !
-I said, let go of the axe!

132
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,634
Arvid. . . come inside.

133
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,638
-Do you know what she's accusing me of?
-Yes.

134
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,595
It's that women that has made it all up

135
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,474
I have never done anything illegal with the heifer.

136
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,516
I believe you, Arvid. I have never believed the
things they have said about you.

137
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:06,430
Do you know what they call me?

138
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,677
The bull of Nybacken.

139
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:15,636
It's not so strange none of the girls
want anything to do with me.

140
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:24,830
Arvid. . . I have a secret.
You're the only one I can tell.

141
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,918
Can I trust you?

142
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,797
You have to promise not to tell anyone.

143
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:46,319
My lips are sealed.
Even if they chop my head off, my lips are sealed.

144
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,797
-I'm going to run away.
-Run away?

145
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:57,439
In the autumn, when they drive the timber to
Karlshamn, I'm taking the boat to America.

146
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:04,477
-Will you come with me, Arvid?
-Yes.

147
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,877
Look at this.

148
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,709
'description of the United States
of America,''-

149
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:25,234
-''with information and advice for emigrants.''

150
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:30,275
in America things aren't split into nobility
and commoners as they are here.

151
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,030
and you can address even the President as 'you'
if you want to.

152
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:41,789
The finest rice comes from
Carolina in North-America.

153
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,596
and it's forbidden to eat salted herring.

154
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,156
''in America no one works more
than 12 hours in a day.''

155
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:56,469
''many of the slaves have better houses,
food and circumstances than peasants in Europe''

156
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:02,994
'they keep their own chickens ands pigs. They can
grow what they want and sell their excess.''

157
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:08,558
-Then I will sell myself as a slave.
-That's illegal for white people.

158
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,150
but, you said America was a free country.

159
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:18,230
Yes, but this particular trade
is illegal for white people.

160
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,792
I'll come even so.

161
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,918
-How much is the fare?
-About 200 riksdaler.

162
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,510
Ah Hell. . . !

163
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,872
200 riksdaler?
I'll never be able to get that much.

164
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,232
-You don't have enough for the fare.
-We have forgotten about the highway!

165
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,069
No, no one can walk to America.

166
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:55,958
-Is there no way?
-No, America is an island.

167
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,072
The god-damn ocean.

168
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:33,271
Last year our harvest rotted away.
This year it's burning up.

169
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,309
We should manage on this till Christmas time,
I should think.

170
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,273
And what will we put on our bread afterwards?

171
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:06,470
-When will we die, mother?
-Only God knows that.

172
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,991
Dad has said that everyone will die.

173
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:20,390
There are a few drops.
Maybe we'll get a shower after all.

174
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,997
-Peek-a-boo!
-No, don't do that!

175
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,478
There's a fire.
There's a fire in the outhouse!

176
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:29,477
You got what you wanted.
That's your punishment.

177
00:38:55,080 --> 00:39:00,518
There was nothing we could do. .
Those few drops didn't help.

178
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,996
is this my little boy with his playhouse?

179
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:34,319
Sneaking away from your work,
you devils lazybones!

180
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,874
oh my god. . . oh my god !

181
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,109
Oh my god !

182
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,075
What is it?

183
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,034
. . .find a good Christian husband. . .

184
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:35,589
-Robert, what is it?
-My ear hurts.

185
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,429
What should I do?

186
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,633
Will have to try some spirits on a piece of wool.

187
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,434
This is going to sting at first,
but it will soon pass.

188
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,151
There. . . that's it.

189
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,232
It helped a little.

190
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,719
but it's still noisy.

191
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,150
It sounds like there's a whole ocean in there.

192
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,668
-Can you hear it?
-No.

193
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,509
Are you home so soon?

194
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,354
Karl Oskar?

195
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:35,116
What's the matter?

196
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:40,234
I broke the plough.
On a big stone bastard.

197
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:46,993
-The soil here is cursed.
-There is no need for profanity.

198
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:51,238
Can't you fix the plough?

199
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,559
Everything falls to pieces,
no matter how hard you work.

200
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:05,071
and there just keeps getting more and more of us.
-Leave the worries to God.

201
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,239
He's not going to feed the children
if we sit here with our hands in our laps.

202
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:16,994
Is it God's responsibility to feed
all the children you produce?

203
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:21,636
Don't blame God for impregnating your wife.

204
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:28,438
My dear, sweetness. . . I have never denied
my part in this.

205
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:33,873
You complain about us multiplying,
as though it were my fault!

206
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,709
I have never blamed you, Kristina?

207
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:43,949
But you never say anything.
So what am I supposed to think?

208
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:49,359
Don't you know that you are dearer to me
than anything else in the world, Kristina.

209
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:55,715
-Do you care for me as you once did?
-Of course I do. You know that.

210
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,998
We have to agree, the two of us.

211
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:10,831
We have to help each other.
There is no one else to help us.

212
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:22,110
Poor child, how he has beaten you !

213
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,237
Come in, Karl Oskar. Look at this.

214
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:34,071
-Who has done this?
-It was Aaron.

215
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,829
I was driving a load of beats
when I broke the axel.

216
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:44,354
He beat me with a fencepost.
I'm not going back there.

217
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,554
Aaron won't let him go just like that.

218
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,879
He hired him for a year.
He will send for the sheriff.

219
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,994
-I'm not going back.
-He shouldn't have to, dad.

220
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,317
No one in this family needs to take a beating.

221
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,797
Wouldn't it be better if we made
this good with Aaron?

222
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,113
I'll go talk to him.

223
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,030
Are you coming in your brothers place?
Then I will have a better farm hand.

224
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:49,790
You'll have to get someone else to beat.

225
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:55,711
The sheriff will have to drag him here then.
Let go of me!

226
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:00,755
You could always come and get him yourself.
Your welcome to come to Korpamoen.

227
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:36,314
- I'm looking for the boy Robert Nilsson.
- He's not here.

228
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:09,514
If you brother stays here in my
territory I'll get him.

229
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,674
There, go inside.

230
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,952
. . .you have to do everything yourself.

231
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:46,633
You said you would handle this.
Do I need to do this too? Answer me!

232
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:52,835
Shut your mouth ! I can't stand your nagging, woman

233
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,078
You could help me from time to time,
but you never do.

234
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:05,118
I'm sick of you. Shut up, bitch !
Shut your mouth, damn woman !

235
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:18,035
God-damn woman ! damn, damn, damn !

236
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,473
Satan !

237
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:39,156
He's a nice guy, that Innegren.
I can see what he was getting at.

238
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,955
Go to Kristina's parents in Duvemåla.

239
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:49,428
That's outside Innegrens territory.

240
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,870
You are kind, Karl Oskar.

241
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,475
Now I need to ask something else of you.

242
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,798
Yes, if I have it to give. . .

243
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,954
I want my share of the inheritance.

244
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:14,596
I am going to North-America.

245
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,710
You're surprised, Karl Oskar.

246
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:36,672
I wouldn't have imagined we were
thinking of the same thing.

247
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,156
There is a wheat field in America. . .

248
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:46,071
''hardworking farmers have good
opportunities to prosper''-

249
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,671
-''in the United States of America.''

250
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,314
That's something !

251
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,230
We might have to work as hard over there
as we do here at home.

252
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:07,992
But at least we can prosper at it,
that's something we can't do over here.

253
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,078
Look at dad !

254
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,749
And what of the children, what will become of them

255
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,475
Johan can take over the farm after us,-

256
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,593
-And the others?
Maid servants, farmhands. . .

257
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,555
but would you take responsibility for
taking them across the ocean-

258
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,559
-and endangering their lives?

259
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:41,678
If only someone else had gone before us,
but no one from here has left.

260
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,633
Then I will have to be the first.

261
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:52,348
-And you would take that responsibility?
-Someone has to.

262
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:09,275
Interrogation of farmer
Danjel Andreasson

263
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:15,438
Do you admit, Danjel Andreasson, that the
following persons reside at your house:

264
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:21,157
The criminal soldier Severius Pihl,
the disabled girl Sissa Svensdotter,-

265
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,317
-the unmarried Ulrika I vesterol,-

266
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:31,232
-her bastard daughter Elin,
and that you arrange meetings at your home?

267
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,316
This is true, father.

268
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:40,312
-And what do you do at these meetings?
-I convey the true teachings of God.

269
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:46,276
The devil is whispering your answers in your ear.

270
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,392
the presence of these honourable and trusted men

271
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:55,834
-I forbid you to practice any kind of preaching.

272
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,872
He has no power to forbid me this.

273
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,869
-Do you admit that my authority comes from God?
-No, father.

274
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:10,599
-Are you refusing to obey law and order?
-No law is above justice.

275
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:15,714
And are you so spiritually arrogant
that you dare call your self just?

276
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:20,675
I am filled by the spirit of our lord.
and I live my life according to the Bible-

277
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,234
-and my conscience.

278
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:28,798
Are you accusing me of leading souls astray,
and leading people straight into hell?

279
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:34,552
That is true. Is it not true
that the father sells spirits?

280
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,194
That is my legal right.

281
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:44,635
When the people drink the fathers spirit
and break the ten commandments,-

282
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:50,357
-hasn't the person breaking the commandments,
damned themselves to hell, father?

283
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,315
You're the one under interrogation, not me.

284
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:01,470
In the presence of these men
I forbid you to preach.

285
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,831
and if you continue your criminal practices,-

286
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,511
-you can be brought up in front of a court
and sentenced to fines or imprisonment,-

287
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:14,270
-and the third time you can
be banished from the land.

288
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:20,953
The father still can't banish
me from the Kingdom of God.

289
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:26,478
Despite the warnings Danjel Andreasson
continued his preaching.

290
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:31,156
Then father Brusander excommunicated him :

291
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:37,833
Danjel was banned from the communion and the
fellowship of the church.

292
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:46,158
Jesus Christ, who's body you are about to receive,-

293
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:49,716
-keep you for eternity.

294
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,594
Jesus Christ, who's blood you are about to receive,-

295
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:58,077
-keep you for eternity.

296
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,839
Jesus Christ, who's body you are about to receive,-

297
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:14,318
-keep you for eternity.

298
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,194
Jesus Christ, who's blood you are about to receive,-

299
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,869
-keep you. . .

300
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:29,792
Dear Danjel. Don't open.

301
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:35,631
Our Lord, Jesus Christ, is with us.
We have nothing to fear.

302
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,239
Who are you that disturbs
the piece at night?

303
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:47,672
It is sheriff Lönnegren. Open !

304
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:53,473
Who is the officer seeking at this hour?

305
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:58,958
You, Danjel Andreasson.
Now open this door, in the name of the law!

306
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,356
I do not obey the laws of humans.

307
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:08,077
If you won't open it is my duty to
kick this door in. Open !

308
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:12,352
The good officer should not increase his sin-

309
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,837
-through brute force against the Lord.

310
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:37,319
What are all these people doing here in the middle
of the night?
-We are gathered for a meal of Love.

311
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:43,754
-You are defiling the holy sacrament.
-We are enjoying the sacraments.

312
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:51,150
Here you can see Danjel Andreasson
distributing the holy communion.

313
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:57,276
-Have you given communion?
-Not to everyone. The officer interrupted.

314
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:02,679
No one who is not ordained, can give communion
The priest has explained this.

315
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:07,191
I do not follow the priest,
I follow the holy scriptures.

316
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:12,314
and nowhere in the scriptures does
it say that Jesus Christ was ordained a priest.

317
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:18,197
-Don't argue with that hair-splitter.
-Take down the names of everyone here.

318
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:24,795
I have forbidden you to preach.

319
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,549
yet you continue. therefore we have no choice
but to punish you according to the letter of the law

320
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,717
I beg you to think of your immortal souls.

321
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:36,755
Anyone who repents their sins/ confusion
are welcome in the church.

322
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:43,035
Move aside, priests! you stand there
black and evil as the devil himself.

323
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:52,595
Your mind is not improved. still you take
the blood of Christ in your filthy mouths.

324
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:57,919
-I dare for you !
-Are you harassing the priest, Ulrika?!

325
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:03,398
-I'm harassing the deacon as well.
-You should wash your mouth.

326
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,354
-With priest-spirit or priest-piss?
-Quiet, whore!

327
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:12,110
whore?! Did you say whore?
A whore to you, Per Persson !

328
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,949
If I'm a whore, then your a punter!

329
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:20,312
Do you remember when you came with riksdalerne
in one hand and your dick in the other-

330
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:25,958
-and asked me to lie on my back for you?
Then you behaved.

331
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:30,073
-Ulrika, be quiet.
-and what about that horehound !

332
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:36,275
No one denies him communion in church.
He is friends with those fat priests.

333
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,315
those comfortable lard bodies living
living in their fat flesh !

334
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:48,438
By the power of your authority you
ought to disperse the gathering.

335
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:52,678
I forbid you to continue the communion.

336
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,236
The father cannot banish the Lord
Jesus Christ from the house.

337
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:00,478
You think these are revelations from God,
but they are from the devil.

338
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:05,390
Get out of here, damn flesh-priests!
Out, I say!

339
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:13,108
Silently I must listen to my accuser

340
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:20,157
and innocently go

341
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:29,518
and forgive and forget

342
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:38,548
safe in the knowledge that God will judge justly

343
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:45,472
Judge at the spring court the year 1849.
Danjel Andreasson : 200 daler silver.

344
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:51,072
other participants at gathering : 100 daler silver
or 28 days in prison.

345
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:56,035
Jesus Christ, who's blood you're about to receive,-

346
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:01,075
-keep you for eternity.

347
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,555
-Can I have some porridge?
-No, not now.

348
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,834
You will get some tonight,
when your little brother is baptised.

349
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:39,953
-I want porridge.
-You can't have any! Go to grandma.

350
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:49,512
You will get porridge tonight, when we're
having guests. We are baptising our little boy.

351
01:01:55,400 --> 01:02:02,112
-The kids are here again.
-I don't suppose they've found much.

352
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:24,078
Anna ! No. . . get away!

353
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,678
Shame on you !

354
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:37,031
There, get out! There!

355
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:51,557
It was a shame to have to send them away.
Couldn't they have stayed at home?

356
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,877
We haven't got more than that?

357
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:01,157
You can't eat that.

358
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:08,152
-Mother is boiling soup on it.
-Take this. Run along home now.

359
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,590
Is it dads little helper coming?

360
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:39,354
You're not cold are you?

361
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,796
Run in to Mother now.

362
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:13,032
Anna ! Anna !

363
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:16,709
Anna !

364
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,394
Anna !

365
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:34,472
Oh no, child. . .

366
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:50,752
-Soon everything will be alright.
-Little Anna.

367
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,509
Let me dry you off a little.

368
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:03,033
The stomach is completely swollen.

369
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,115
Don't you think we have to get Berta from ldemo?

370
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:26,438
Let see how the little girl is.

371
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:33,756
Yes. . . she's very poorly.

372
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:41,911
The grains in the porridge have
swelled to twice their size.

373
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:49,230
They might have burst the stomach,
in which case there is nothing I can do for her.

374
01:05:54,680 --> 01:06:00,789
We'll have to see how she is tomorrow,
if things take a turn for the better,-

375
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:06,631
-but if they don't, I'm afraid
God will take this little girl with him.

376
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,911
Yes, I think so.

377
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:19,235
But we have to believe it might turn.
Nobody knows what might happen.

378
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:12,958
You've been sitting here all day.
Won't you let me make the coffin?

379
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:27,953
Listen.
Won't you let me make it for you?

380
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:58,198
Now I'm no longer opposed to moving to North-America

381
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:39,949
Don't touch the washing with your filthy fingers!

382
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:47,238
Leave the washing be. Don't make it mucky
now that we've gotten it clean.

383
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:12,995
We can bring that along too.

384
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:18,274
There, yes. Let grandpa keep that.

385
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:29,875
''on roads like these one travels
at great speeds.''

386
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,198
''two to three miles an hour,
yes, sometimes even faster.''

387
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:40,270
''many large wagons are bound together
and are pulled by a steam engine.''

388
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:44,871
''on the road is lain powerful
cross beams made of wood,''-

389
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:50,836
-''and the metal bars used to guide the
wagons are attached to these.''

390
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:57,752
''each wagon is so comfortable it makes
disembarking unnecessary.''

391
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:03,193
''these railroads, where one through the
bower of steam can enjoy a comfortable journey,''-

392
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:09,395
-''have reached a length of 8000 English miles
in America.''

393
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:15,829
The grass grows so thick that one has enough for
winter fodder for a cow in just two days.

394
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:22,029
Does the railroad lay on the ground unguarded
night and day?

395
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:25,755
Doesn't the iron get stolen?

396
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:30,715
In America there is such an abundance of iron
that no one steals as much as a track.

397
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,798
It's the same with silver and gold.

398
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:40,519
In America they will hang a thief immediately,
often before he has time to confess.

399
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:45,111
Americans are the most honest people in the world.

400
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:48,357
they must have a bastard or two even they.

401
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:04,072
-You have some people with you.
-Six.

402
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:08,876
You will be more. Your family will
be bigger than you can imagine.

403
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,152
You haven't asked the council of your children
or grandchildren.

404
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:18,673
-I am thinking of my children.
-I am thinking about mine.

405
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:26,195
Since he's been able to button his own trousers
he's never once asked our council.

406
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:30,711
and no one wants un-requested advice.

407
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,633
Is your ear hurting?

408
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:44,275
It will be OK once we get to America.

409
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:55,318
I read about a man whose family had been
eaten by a crocodile.

410
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,511
there were three children,
and it had just swallowed the wife.

411
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:06,509
but the woman's head got stuck in it's
throat so that the animal choked.

412
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:12,954
That was her way of getting even.
The ground was soaked in human blood.

413
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:18,518
-Are we going to those parts?
-You know Roberts fantasies?

414
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,679
They're not fantasies.
I've read it.

415
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,033
Kristina?

416
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:46,834
From Karl Oskar

417
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,110
Could it be the sheriff?

418
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:18,714
-Who is it?
-Danjel. Can I come in?

419
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,875
-May God bring peace to your house.
-Is something wrong at home?

420
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,278
No, everything is fine with wife and children.

421
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:33,871
-Then, what's the matter?
-What is it?

422
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:41,309
-I have a message for you, Karl Oskar.
-From whom?

423
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:46,955
From God.

424
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,719
The Lord woke me and said :

425
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:55,551
''Go to Karl Oskar, husband of your
beloved niece.''

426
01:14:55,680 --> 01:15:00,674
He spoke to me as He spoke to Abraham
He said :

427
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:06,158
''Leave your motherland,
your family and your fathers house,''-

428
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,158
-''travel to a country I will show you.''

429
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:14,434
''Go to Karl Oskar at Korpamoen.
He will be of help to you.''

430
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:19,395
Do you want to come with us to America?

431
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:24,878
We live in a time of persecution in
my motherland.

432
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,870
I am prohibited to seek my God.
I have been banished from the land.

433
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,992
but the Lord will open a new land to me.

434
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:38,113
We shall travel there together,
and no one need be afraid.

435
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:41,789
So you will be six?

436
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:47,074
We will be eight, with children and guests.

437
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:50,470
Are you bringing all your guests as well?

438
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:58,109
Ulrika and the girl are coming.
I have promised them.

439
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:02,870
-Does Danjel need a farmhand?
-Yes.

440
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,754
The other one ran away with the coming
of the time of persecution.

441
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:12,876
I know one that would be handy in America.
His name is Arvid.

442
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,877
We will place it all in the hands of the Lord.

443
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:24,235
He will aid us with all His mighty power,
So we can cross the perilous ocean safely.

444
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:33,753
You're going to be a bad example to
my other parishioners, Karl Oskar Nilsson.

445
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:37,395
You're known as a fast and handy farmer

446
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:41,752
Capable of making a living from your farm.

447
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:44,917
I'm afraid I can't, father.

448
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:52,116
You have enough food. one should be
content as long as there is food on the table.

449
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:58,554
Have you really thought about this 'adventure'
you're dragging your family along to?

450
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:03,071
Do you know the truth about the country
that tempts you?

451
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:09,594
Have you not been misled?
By smoke and mirrors?

452
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:15,670
This could be the downfall of you and yours.
I have to advice against it.

453
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:20,635
-You believe I want only the best for you?
-I believe the father has good intentions.

454
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:24,389
Think of your parents.
Your father is a cripple.

455
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:27,910
The old ones have enough to manage on.

456
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:31,828
You have been possessed by the
spirit of discontent

457
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:38,069
I have already sold, and am now free.
May I go about my business?

458
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:48,433
I will give you your emigration license.

459
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,755
And I will ask the Lord to bless you and yours
on the journey to far away lands.

460
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:17,398
May you never regret your bold choice.

461
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,511
Thank you, humbly. .

462
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:39,912
Stop, that's enough ! That's enough.

463
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:43,589
Enough? What are you talking about?
Just a little more!

464
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:59,109
Aren't we going soon?

465
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:49,155
Nobody knows what they wear on their
feet in America.

466
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:54,274
I am sure you can wear these in front of
Americans without having to be ashamed.

467
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:58,757
They were expensive.

468
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:04,398
To think that so many are emigrating
at the same time. Jonas Petter as well.

469
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:08,752
Karl Oskar, there is something
I have to tell you.

470
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:14,079
-I'm in that way again.
-hmmmm. . .

471
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:24,638
-It couldn't have come at a worse time.
-What?!

472
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:28,958
I'm just saying. . . this isn't the best time.

473
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:32,038
I can't get pregnant only when it suits you !

474
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:37,359
It's not just my fault that I'm pregnant again.
It's your fault too!

475
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:42,918
-this isn't the best time for you !
-Why do you have to take this so badly?

476
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:49,070
-You're afraid I will be a hindrance!
-I never said that.

477
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:52,510
I'm just afraid this will make it even
harder on you.

478
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:59,751
ether. We should be friends on this, our last evening

479
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:07,468
-Well. . . I don't feel well.
-I know, I know.

480
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:12,549
-You need to speak softly to me.
-No harsh words from me.

481
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:29,152
Drive slowly through the gate.

482
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:16,792
It's a good thing your so thin,
or I would have had to walk along side.

483
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:58,839
Arvid, when we get to Karlshamn,
I'm going to buy an English textbook.

484
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:03,238
There will be time to learn during the voyage
You can borrow it if you want.

485
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:08,309
-I don't need it.
-You don't speak English, do you?

486
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:13,833
No, not now. But when I step ashore
in America I will.

487
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:20,990
So you think you will be fluent
as soon as you step ashore?

488
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:25,836
-Who told you that?
-Danjel.

489
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:32,433
But you will have to teach yourself
the language, for you are not of the spirit.

490
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:38,237
-Could this be true?
-You don't think Danjel is lying?

491
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:44,959
When we step ashore the holy spirit will reach
out to all true believers,-

492
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:51,758
-and everyone who is born again through Jesus
Christ shall be able to speak American.

493
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:57,432
-Have you read the Gospels?
-Yes. . .

494
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:01,917
But I haven't heard about that part.

495
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:12,195
Hey, Robert? I'm afraid of America.

496
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:17,678
-Why?
-Maybe they are mean to the newcomers.

497
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:23,079
No, you have nothing to be afraid of.
There are so few women in America-

498
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:31,471
-that they are treated like gold and jewels.
You will have everything you ever wanted.

499
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:38,153
so that the wagons won't fall off,
they've attached little hooks. . . . . .

500
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,839
God's peace!

501
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:16,988
There was the bishop with his rod pointing
to high heaven like a church candle.

502
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:22,717
They couldn't bury him like that so they
called all the priests in the area,-

503
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:26,196
-such as the priest Stenmark,
who read over his body,-

504
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:30,677
-but still it wouldn't go flaccid.
The devil refused to leave his body.

505
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:38,354
Eventually they asked the old maid
Magda for help,-

506
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:42,758
-she went into the room where he was lying
and stayed there through the night,-

507
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:49,513
-and in them morning when the rest came in,
he was fit for burial like normal people.

508
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:54,475
-I wonder if we'll get seasick on the ship.
-It's not that bad.

509
01:29:54,600 --> 01:30:00,675
-You only vomit a little.
-Probably like being knocked up.

510
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:07,876
-They say it's meant to be terrible.
-Don't you remember what I said?

511
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,391
-Have you forgotten what I told you?
-No, of course not.

512
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:19,710
People who have Christ in them can take the
sea, even if they are not used to it.

513
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:23,230
I believe you. I'm not afraid.

514
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:27,911
-Don't you get seasick like everyone else?
-No, Karl Oskar.

515
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:34,354
-Christ died for my sins.
-You have doubts, Karl Oskar.

516
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:39,998
I have heard that married women suffer more
than others at sea.

517
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:43,317
Not if they are true in spirit, Jonas Petter.

518
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:51,028
Most women are of the flesh. You can make
bastards in the marriage bed like anywhere else.

519
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:57,269
I thought the scurvy and the cholera
were more dangerous than seasickness?

520
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:02,235
-I've heard that. . .
-Let us give praise to the Lord on this the
first day of our voyage.

521
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:09,156
Thank you, Lord, for keeping your hand over us.

522
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:12,511
This the first day of our voyage.

523
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:26,196
Johan !

524
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:35,118
Where are we meant to live?

525
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:41,475
Let's see. You and you. Go over here.

526
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:45,149
-Karl Oskar!
-I'm coming.

527
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:55,190
Here?

528
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:59,438
-There is no room.
-I want to stay with my family!

529
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:02,916
I don't understand what your saying.

530
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:07,397
Let me speak to the captain?

531
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:24,596
Arvid ! Over here.

532
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:29,111
The beasts at home in the barn have more space!

533
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:58,276
Passengers and cargo

534
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:19,874
-Nice with some fresh air.
-Yes.

535
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:12,555
-I got 16.
-Yeah, so did I.

536
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:16,673
-Do you want to climb her?
-Yeah, let's do it.

537
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:39,357
-This far, but no further.
-They wouldn't let us go further.

538
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:42,995
-How many did you get?
-36.

539
01:37:54,160 --> 01:38:00,315
What if the sea rises.
Then we will all drown.

540
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:07,915
No. if the sea rises, so does the ship.

541
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:27,392
How many are you?

542
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:32,275
Don't the whole family come running.
One person is enough.

543
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:36,313
They keep popping out babies those people.
Come over here!

544
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:43,676
and bring something to carry
bread and such in.

545
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:58,679
Don't we get potatoes?

546
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:03,271
-No milk either?
-We don't carry goats aboard.

547
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,755
I don't want to stay on this ship.
I want to be at home.

548
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:39,239
potatoes. they didn't have any potatoes. We're get

549
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:42,352
-No milk either?
-No.

550
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:47,031
It stinks of piss here.
I need a clothes peg.

551
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:53,872
-When do we get to use the kitchen?
-Will probably be a while with so many people.

552
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:59,518
Karl Oskar, little-Marta is burning up.
And she won't eat.

553
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:03,235
How's it going?

554
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:07,148
Do you think she caught it off that
girl over there?

555
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:12,957
No, she's just got a cold.
That one over there has struma.

556
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:21,276
-Does she have to live so close.
-Who?

557
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:27,277
-the merry one?
-Why do they call her ''merry''?

558
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:32,030
-Because she is never sad.
-And if anyone has cause to be sad, it's her.

559
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:37,792
-If anyone entitled were to cry blood. . .
-Never you mind about that.

560
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:44,359
We have so much else to think about. I'm sorry
you don't get to live with us.

561
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:52,114
You like going on the swing !

562
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:58,753
We hardly have enough water for the food,
and we can't ask the first mate for any more.

563
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:03,954
You can borrow some water of us.
We don't use that much.

564
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:09,989
-Thank you so much.
-Where are you headed when you get there?

565
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:14,792
We're not sure. What about you?

566
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:19,277
We have a son in Minnesota.

567
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:23,359
-Is the soil good there?
-The soil is great there.

568
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:30,033
-He's got 500 acres to himself.
-He's a good lad.

569
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:39,278
He wrote to tell us he had 500 acres.
We brought him a grinding stone as a present.

570
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:44,758
-They are very expensive in America.
-Are they?

571
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:48,634
I'm sick and hunched over.
I have a pain in my heart.

572
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:54,551
It let's up in the morning. But if I take a
pinch or two of 'snus', it starts up again.

573
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:05,634
It's a pain. . .

574
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:12,552
. . .like this. but it starts up.

575
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:30,317
''Move the lips a little. But neither round
nor pout them.''

576
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:35,798
'It is important that there is no
pouting of the lips,''-

577
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:42,712
-''especially when producing the
very common sj-sound.''

578
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:47,914
-Do you understand this?
-Yes.

579
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:55,754
I'll show you. You mustn't go like this.

580
01:43:55,880 --> 01:44:02,991
I don't pout my mouth like that
when I'm speaking Swedish either.

581
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:07,352
Say the sj-sound.

582
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:10,711
Seasick.

583
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:13,115
Seasick.

584
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:15,834
Don't stick your lips that far forward.

585
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:20,311
seasick.

586
01:44:20,440 --> 01:44:25,753
-say it again.
-seasick.

587
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:32,558
seasick.

588
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:35,478
Yeah, you managed that alright.

589
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:40,230
It won't hurt to know a little
of the English language

590
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:44,672
so that when you step ashore you've
taken some of the burden off the holy spirit,-

591
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:48,588
-and that can't possibly be a sin.

592
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:56,638
Say: ''rail, star, shoot.''

593
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:05,391
rail, star, shoot

594
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:11,516
rail, star, shoot

595
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:22,913
And continue in this way to learn
the proper placement of the tongue as well.

596
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:27,079
Stick out your tongue. Let me have a look at it.

597
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:41,359
You'll have no problem learning
English with that tongue.

598
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:53,112
Elin ! Elin, come over here!
I need your help over here.

599
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:07,716
. . .it started to bleed,
then he passed out,-

600
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:14,439
-but she prepared a compress to stop the blood,-

601
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:18,075
-and then she stopped the blood, and when he
woke up it was no longer bleeding.

602
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:25,231
It made him a bit slow afterwards.
But completely devoted to her even so.

603
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:29,273
She saved what she had cut off and dried it,-

604
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:34,269
-and they would bring it out and show people
when they had guests and such.

605
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:40,157
He only had a little left. That's why they
called lsak from Aranset ''stumpy''.

606
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:44,558
And that's as true as I stand here before you.

607
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:51,432
Ahh, what a life!
No farmer to force one out-

608
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:55,189
-to feed the horses.

609
01:47:55,320 --> 01:48:00,155
and they feed you as well,
so much it leaves you out of breath.

610
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:03,750
It was good fortune that we come along.

611
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:10,956
I'm going to go ask them
how much further we have left.

612
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:17,914
How far do we have left to North-America?

613
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:24,678
Just as far as it is from North-America
to here, with a difference of about 50 miles.

614
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:35,076
You sheep's cunt! Do you think we farmers
are stupider than you.

615
01:50:37,880 --> 01:50:46,117
-What is it? You're not sick are you?
-I'm covered in lice!

616
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:51,872
Don't look at me. This is disgusting !

617
01:50:52,000 --> 01:51:00,192
In all my life I've never had a louse,
until I came here. . .

618
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:03,915
Don't take it so hard.

619
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:09,194
You must have got them off another passenger.

620
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:16,077
It's you, you old whore, you've given me lice!

621
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:19,431
Your men have spread your lice all over the parish.

622
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:23,997
Now you're going to America
to spread your lice there as well?

623
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:29,911
Ah, I see your wife has brought her lice from home?

624
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:35,672
They probably didn't want to be separated from such
an upstanding woman. Control your wife instead.

625
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:39,156
Kristina from Korpamoen,
we're having this out!

626
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:44,115
You accuse me of infesting this ship with lice!
You accuse me of bringing vermin.

627
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:50,952
Danjel, she has insulted the body of Christ
and the purity of his lamb.

628
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:54,117
She only has herself to blame for having lice.

629
01:51:54,240 --> 01:52:00,952
-Ask for forgiveness on your knees!
-I'd rather kneel to the devil himself!

630
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:05,517
-Did you hear, Danjel ! She swore!
-Shut up, the both of you !

631
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:13,035
Since I was born again I have been free of lice.
You won't find any lice on me!

632
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:17,631
-Have you no shame?!
-You accused me!

633
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:24,029
-Anyone who wants is free to look for themselves.
-Do not fall for the temptation of arrogance.

634
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:31,589
You shouldn't use your body to awaken
sinful lusts in the men folk.

635
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:37,636
I will clear my name!
Inga-Lena here will be my independent witness.

636
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:41,309
Come and look, Inga-Lena.

637
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:49,191
-Now you've done it.
-I called her a ''whore''. And I stand by that.

638
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:53,279
You shouldn't say such things about Ulrika.

639
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:59,396
-Well, Inga-Lena. Did you find any lice?
-No.

640
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:03,433
-Not as much a s a little egg?
-No.

641
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:07,872
There you see!
Kristina on your knees. . .

642
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:14,678
-Never! I'd rather jump in the ocean !
-On your knees, I said !

643
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:18,759
I don't want you on this ship any longer!
Slut! Whore!

644
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:22,270
Danjel, look!

645
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:26,234
Me too. . .I've got. . .

646
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:37,918
This creature is also one of God's creations.

647
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:44,832
It has been sent as a trial for us,
so that we may grow stronger.

648
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:52,679
Now we know things are really bad for Sweden,
even the lice are emigrating.

649
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:34,274
Dear Inga-Lena. . . Dear wife!

650
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:39,269
Dear wife, are you seasick?

651
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:44,599
-My dear, sweet Danjel. I'm sorry!
-Have you lost your faith?

652
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:48,554
Have you been listening to the enemy?

653
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:24,556
We're sinking !

654
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:28,116
It's just a storm. Be quiet.

655
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:34,634
-Can't you feel we're sinking !
-That's just the seasickness.

656
01:56:34,760 --> 01:56:38,878
Karl Oskar, I can't breath.

657
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:44,358
You have as much air as me. Be quiet now!

658
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:05,992
I can't see where to vomit in this darkness.

659
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:17,833
I drowned a cat once. It suffered before it died.

660
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:23,478
-Do you think I will be forgiven?
-What are you talking about?

661
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:29,709
-I can hear the cat crying down there!
-You're just imagining things.

662
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:39,075
Oh God, I have been an unfaithful servant.

663
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:11,876
Let me out of here!

664
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:28,434
Come on, Robert.
You can't just lie here, you get that.

665
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:11,313
It can't be good for you
to lie all alone, Karl Oskar.

666
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:35,314
-Won't you eat a little?
-No.

667
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:41,117
-Did you manage to give the kids some food?
-They get enough to survive.

668
02:00:43,320 --> 02:00:50,635
-It's a good thing their healthy.
-So will you be as soon as the weather calms.

669
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:55,754
Won't you take a spoon of the Prince's drops?

670
02:00:58,640 --> 02:01:03,873
Am I fantasising, or. . .?

671
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:14,150
It is the little girl who died.
It wasn't seasickness it was struma.

672
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:22,994
-I have to say something.
-What?

673
02:01:23,120 --> 02:01:27,636
I will never set my foot in America.

674
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:34,598
Yes, Karl Oskar. I've known it ever since
we boarded this ship.

675
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:39,111
I won't get out of here alive.

676
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:43,870
What are these fantasies of yours!
Seasickness isn't fatal.

677
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:48,790
We will step ashore in America.
You and me together.

678
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:29,514
Can't you wait a little!
He often lies like this in the mornings.

679
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:32,598
You have to shake him hard and long
before he wakes up.

680
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:37,350
His heart stops sometimes,
but then it starts right back up again.

681
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:42,076
This man is a dead as one can get.
I've seen dead people before.

682
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:47,433
Can't you wait a little? An hour or so, only.

683
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:53,317
-Till he starts to smell?
-Just a little longer!

684
02:02:54,720 --> 02:03:00,989
Be a good first mate.
I won't let you take him !

685
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:22,509
It's me who should be here now!

686
02:04:52,240 --> 02:04:57,678
-Why aren't we going to live in a house, Mother?
-in America we will live in a house.

687
02:04:57,800 --> 02:05:01,759
Here look at this.

688
02:05:01,880 --> 02:05:06,556
You're bringing a bad wife with you to America.

689
02:05:06,680 --> 02:05:11,834
-Marta ! Come here, Marta.
-Come over here to Mother.

690
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:22,594
She's gotten so grumpy.
What's the matter, Inga-Lena?

691
02:05:24,280 --> 02:05:28,478
I'm so dizzy.

692
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:32,434
I don't think I'm feeling well.

693
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:40,035
Lately I've had blood in my stool.
I think it's scurvy.

694
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:44,517
You must stay in bed,
and let Danjel do your chores.

695
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:49,077
He mustn't find out.
He has enough to worry about.

696
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:55,070
-Is he unwell, as well?
-No, but he is having a crisis of faith.

697
02:05:55,200 --> 02:06:01,116
-He walks around suffering.
-He could still help out a little.

698
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:05,313
You mustn't say anything, but. . .

699
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:10,673
Danjel has confessed that he has committed
the graves sin there is.

700
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:14,190
He has believed himself free of sin.

701
02:06:14,320 --> 02:06:19,474
But then he got seasick,
and after that he has been a changed man.

702
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:24,879
He says there isn't a single
just person here, Ulrika.

703
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:28,959
She escaped both the lice and the seasickness.

704
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:32,959
He says God has protected this vessel for her sake.

705
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:40,270
Don't mention anything about this to Danjel,
and don't tell him I'm unwell. Promise me!

706
02:06:56,440 --> 02:06:59,557
Oh my God, Kristina !
What has happened to you?

707
02:07:02,680 --> 02:07:08,357
I'm so tired, Karl Oskar.
I can't take it any longer.

708
02:07:08,480 --> 02:07:13,634
-Are you in great pain?
-I'm just so tired.

709
02:07:13,720 --> 02:07:21,149
It's because of all the blood you've lost.
We have to stop it. Lie still !

710
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:28,748
-I don't want Mother to bleed any more.
-I'll go wake the captain.

711
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:32,589
No, no. . . don't leave me, Karl Oskar!

712
02:07:39,680 --> 02:07:43,036
My wife is bleeding to death.
Can the captain do anything?

713
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:08,276
Change the compress on her forehead once every hour

714
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:44,873
-Karl Oskar?
-Yes.

715
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:50,677
-You will be kind to the children won't you?
-Yes, of course.

716
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:57,118
That's good to hear. From now on
you'll have to be both mother and father to them.

717
02:08:57,240 --> 02:09:01,631
Don't talk like that, Kristina.

718
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:07,551
-Don't you want anything?
-No, nothing.

719
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:20,269
Do you want a sugar cube?
I've been saving them for you.

720
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:27,272
You a kind man, Karl Oskar.
I don't have the strength to chew.

721
02:09:33,400 --> 02:09:39,032
dear, Kristina. Kristina !

722
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:44,070
I wanted. . .

723
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:49,149
I wanted. . .to ask your forgiveness.

724
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:54,593
What would I have to forgive you?

725
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:58,508
That I wanted to make this journey.

726
02:09:58,640 --> 02:10:03,919
-I wanted to as well.
-But it was me who pushed for it.

727
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:10,309
You wanted to make things better for us,
better for all of us.

728
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:16,913
Don't be sad, Karl Oskar.

729
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:21,397
So you forgive me? Kristina?

730
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:29,234
I have nothing to forgive you.
Remember that.

731
02:10:29,360 --> 02:10:32,113
That's good to hear. .

732
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:43,751
I like you.

733
02:10:46,040 --> 02:10:50,113
I always have.

734
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:57,635
-We are the best of friends.
-Yes, we are.

735
02:10:57,760 --> 02:11:02,436
We are the best of friends, we are.

736
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:11,637
-I'm going to sleep a little.
-Yes, sleep.

737
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:17,676
-Sleep. You need it.
-Only a little while.

738
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:23,079
Of course you should sleep. Only. . .

739
02:11:23,200 --> 02:11:26,829
As long as you don't. . .

740
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:59,198
Dad ! Mother has stopped bleeding.

741
02:12:05,640 --> 02:12:10,111
-She is dead.
-No, she is alive.

742
02:12:10,240 --> 02:12:14,119
I think she'll make it now.

743
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:20,793
-She just died.
-Can't you see for yourself?

744
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:27,073
Inga-Lena died a while back.

745
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:33,912
She never told me she was that poorly.
She never once complained.

746
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:40,879
Earth to earth, dust to dust.

747
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:46,074
Jesus Christ will wake you on the day of reckoning

748
02:12:58,280 --> 02:13:08,030
her the Lords angels sing

749
02:13:17,320 --> 02:13:23,077
And the Lord said onto you as he said onto Moses:

750
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:27,352
''you shall not reach there.''

751
02:13:27,480 --> 02:13:32,474
You, my beloved, didn't get to
see the new land either.

752
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:38,516
You reached the other shore ahead of us.

753
02:13:38,640 --> 02:13:43,555
But when I wanted to set out,
for America you said :

754
02:13:43,680 --> 02:13:48,470
''where you go, I goeth.''

755
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:53,230
''where you stay, I stayeth.''

756
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:57,911
''where you die, I dieth,''-

757
02:13:58,040 --> 02:14:02,033
-''and there I will be buried.''

758
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:38,119
-will we get there by midsummer?
-Yes, I think so.

759
02:14:38,240 --> 02:14:42,392
Then we've been at sea for exactly 10 weeks.

760
02:14:42,520 --> 02:14:47,116
-Do you want to read the English book?
-Yeah, let's do that.

761
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:56,834
What were you meant to say again when
seeking a placement?

762
02:14:56,960 --> 02:15:02,671
''what can you do?
l am used to farm work.''

763
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:07,828
-Let me practice mine as well?
-''I am the new servant girl.''

764
02:15:07,960 --> 02:15:13,751
''l am the new servant girl.''

765
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:17,316
''wash your hands before food.''

766
02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:22,116
-''wash your''. . .
-Shit!

767
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:33,672
''wash your hands
before you handle the food.''

768
02:15:33,800 --> 02:15:36,678
-befor-e!
-befor-e.

769
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:44,759
Why do they think all maids
have dirty hands in America?

770
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:50,598
I don't know.

771
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:55,555
It's probably because everything
is so nice and clean in the new world-

772
02:15:55,680 --> 02:15:59,514
-that they have to ask those who
came from the old, dirty world.

773
02:16:33,480 --> 02:16:38,873
Are you going to throw all that out?
I can clean and mend them when we get ashore.

774
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:43,278
The sight of these garments will
onyx be a torment to us.

775
02:16:43,400 --> 02:16:46,517
don't want to be ashamed in front of the American

776
02:16:46,640 --> 02:16:50,872
When they see these rags
they will wonder who we are,

777
02:16:57,360 --> 02:17:03,117
Robert! Robert!
They can see America ! They can see America !

778
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:17,751
Hold on tight.

779
02:19:17,880 --> 02:19:20,997
Now it's your turn.

780
02:19:37,720 --> 02:19:44,034
Jump ashore! There you go!

781
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:48,950
Such a good boy to make it ashore on your own.

782
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:57,870
-What do we do with the cargo?
-As interpreter I'm in charge.

783
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:02,915
Can you keep an eye on this whilst
I go change some money with the captain?

784
02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:07,352
I've heard Landberg is coming with us.

785
02:20:09,160 --> 02:20:12,709
It says something about California.

786
02:20:20,320 --> 02:20:23,596
It's about ships for California.

787
02:21:01,120 --> 02:21:04,032
Stop that!

788
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:08,517
The Fin says every tenth person here is a thief.

789
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:13,668
He also says every fifth woman is a whore.

790
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:21,309
Do you want to buy a dog? Isn't this a nice
watch? He's running away.

791
02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:10,152
-Does your ear hurt again?
-No, just howling.

792
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:32,398
-Arvid !
-He smells of spirits.

793
02:22:34,400 --> 02:22:38,029
No. Come, Arvid.

794
02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:40,151
Give me a dollar!

795
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:48,994
Are you asleep, Kristina?

796
02:23:49,080 --> 02:23:52,834
He's moving.

797
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:58,795
He'll be ok.

798
02:24:01,720 --> 02:24:04,598
Close your eyes. And smell.

799
02:24:06,320 --> 02:24:09,596
It can't be!

800
02:24:09,720 --> 02:24:14,475
Now you can eat and drink
as much as you can stomach

801
02:24:14,600 --> 02:24:17,751
We have enough of that.

802
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:26,555
Have you ever seen such a beautiful apple?

803
02:24:26,680 --> 02:24:29,911
I got it as a gift.

804
02:24:32,320 --> 02:24:35,118
Come here, let's see.

805
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:41,675
There you go, and there.

806
02:24:44,240 --> 02:24:48,233
I think America is a good place.
We won't need to regret our choice.

807
02:25:07,880 --> 02:25:10,917
Wait here, I'm going to go look for our places.

808
02:25:15,160 --> 02:25:19,597
Robert! Arvid ! We're going over here.

809
02:25:19,720 --> 02:25:23,599
Wait here, Kristina.
I'm going to go get them.

810
02:26:00,440 --> 02:26:03,079
The train's leaving. Hold on tight!

811
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:49,076
-Landberg, can't we open the doors?
-They're locked. They'll open them when we stop.

812
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:55,878
Three fingers ripped of the left hand.
That's how powerful the steam engine is.

813
02:26:56,000 --> 02:27:03,634
-What if the steam gets out?
-I don't think so, but. . .

814
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:09,073
This is a strange invention. Not many people
back home have been this comfortable.

815
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:12,795
Does anyone collect the shit,
so that it may benefit the soil?

816
02:27:12,920 --> 02:27:17,789
You remember you promised we would stick together

817
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:23,711
I won't forget my word. No matter what happens.
We stick together, no matter what.

818
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:32,595
-How much is this?
-25 cent.

819
02:27:32,720 --> 02:27:38,955
It help against cholera, diarrhoea,
hair loss and other things.

820
02:27:39,080 --> 02:27:43,278
-Doesn't smell very nice.
-Is it meant to be a pain killer?

821
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:48,793
They have nice looking money.
Decorated with all the stars of the night sky.

822
02:27:48,920 --> 02:27:53,118
They represent the 13 first states.

823
02:27:53,240 --> 02:27:56,994
It says something there,
at the top, under the woman.

824
02:27:57,120 --> 02:28:01,591
''in god we trust''.
that means ''in God we trust''.

825
02:28:01,720 --> 02:28:07,829
What is he saying? Have you heard anything like it?
There is a confession of faith on their money!

826
02:28:07,960 --> 02:28:12,351
This is a good and God-fearing
country we have arrived in.

827
02:28:12,480 --> 02:28:16,792
We should thank the Lord we have been
able to come here.

828
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:52,751
-Aren't you going to eat?
-We don't have anything more to eat.

829
02:29:36,320 --> 02:29:41,678
-If bread is good enough for you.
-Thank you !

830
02:29:54,200 --> 02:29:58,478
If there are no delays we will
be in Buffalo by the morning.

831
02:30:34,960 --> 02:30:38,589
The look almost like the nobility at home.

832
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:45,353
I've told you that people aren't separated into
nobility and commoners over here.

833
02:30:45,480 --> 02:30:50,508
I only said they weren't segregated
into different places.

834
02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:55,953
There are those who are doing well, and. . .

835
02:30:56,080 --> 02:30:59,834
There are two different kinds of people in America.

836
02:30:59,960 --> 02:31:03,475
Those who have lived here long enough to get rich,-

837
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:08,913
-and the new arrivals,
who haven't had time to get rich yet.

838
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:13,556
To think they got to sea when they don't have to.

839
02:31:27,520 --> 02:31:31,513
Now I've found out the truth,
and you owe us some answers.

840
02:31:32,480 --> 02:31:36,075
-You've tricked us.
-What are you accusing me of?

841
02:31:36,200 --> 02:31:42,389
-You said we were travelling 250 miles.
-That's what the captain on the Charlotta told me.

842
02:31:42,520 --> 02:31:47,469
Our interpreter has told us we're going 1500 miles.
And he doesn't lie.

843
02:31:47,600 --> 02:31:50,478
But you lie. You lying cunt!

844
02:31:50,600 --> 02:31:56,835
Here we sail across one ocean after another
All because we trust you.

845
02:31:56,960 --> 02:32:00,111
Are you accusing me. . .? You old. . .

846
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:05,633
Just say. The whole word. Say it!
You old slut!

847
02:32:05,760 --> 02:32:08,069
Calm down ! You are both right.

848
02:32:08,200 --> 02:32:14,036
American miles are shorter than Swedish miles.
There are six American miles to every Swedish.

849
02:32:14,160 --> 02:32:18,711
If there are others who think I have
misled you, then step forward.

850
02:32:18,840 --> 02:32:22,958
-Be quiet now.
-No, I want to know the truth.

851
02:32:23,080 --> 02:32:27,392
I haven't asked you all to follow
me to Minnesota.

852
02:32:27,520 --> 02:32:32,833
I haven't asked to lead you.
You can settle wherever you want.

853
02:32:32,960 --> 02:32:37,909
-Shake hands now.
-Didn't you hear what he called me!

854
02:32:38,040 --> 02:32:46,311
-You called me a liar.
-Shake hands now.

855
02:32:46,440 --> 02:32:50,991
-Shake hands.
-Ulrika !

856
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:57,355
You know we trust you.
And that we all owe you.

857
02:33:02,920 --> 02:33:06,230
I can't take 'merry' any longer.

858
02:33:06,360 --> 02:33:10,273
She belongs to Danjel's family
and she's good with children.

859
02:33:10,400 --> 02:33:13,710
I like her better now that we have arrived.

860
02:33:13,840 --> 02:33:20,871
Danjel said they have done her an injustice.
That she was sold at an auction when she was little

861
02:33:22,280 --> 02:33:26,831
She's furious cause she hasn't had a man in a while

862
02:33:26,960 --> 02:33:30,555
She should have a stake in her,
as long as it was barked.

863
02:34:29,720 --> 02:34:32,518
all aboard !

864
02:34:46,640 --> 02:34:49,916
Isn't little-Marta with you?

865
02:34:50,040 --> 02:34:53,316
No. Isn't she aboard the boat?

866
02:34:53,440 --> 02:34:57,115
Are you sure?
I thought she was with you.

867
02:34:57,240 --> 02:34:59,674
The child is left ashore!

868
02:35:04,560 --> 02:35:09,554
-Marta ! Marta !
-Karl Oskar!

869
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:13,753
-What's happened?
-Is Marta there?

870
02:35:14,640 --> 02:35:17,552
No, I haven't seen her.

871
02:35:17,680 --> 02:35:22,071
Marta ! Little-Marta !

872
02:35:25,640 --> 02:35:27,949
Marta !

873
02:35:29,840 --> 02:35:31,796
Little-Marta !

874
02:35:31,920 --> 02:35:38,712
Have you seen my daughter?
She is so small. Please!

875
02:35:42,600 --> 02:35:45,194
Marta !

876
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:50,629
Little-Marta !

877
02:35:50,760 --> 02:35:55,117
She's not here. Marta !

878
02:35:55,240 --> 02:36:01,076
You let her go. She's fallen in the lake!

879
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:07,150
-Where is she?! Marta !
-The boat is leaving.

880
02:36:08,440 --> 02:36:13,594
-We can't just leave her.
-What about the other kids!

881
02:36:13,720 --> 02:36:20,831
Wait, good people!
Little-Marta. . . Little-Marta is left behind !

882
02:36:20,960 --> 02:36:23,679
-hurry up, lady!
-We have to look for her!

883
02:36:23,800 --> 02:36:29,909
Wait! Wait!

884
02:36:30,040 --> 02:36:32,793
Hurry up!

885
02:36:39,120 --> 02:36:42,829
get that plank up.

886
02:36:44,120 --> 02:36:49,069
She was down on the beach playing with the shells.

887
02:36:49,200 --> 02:36:53,432
She was having so much fun,
I could hardly get her to come along.

888
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:10,677
-What did you say the disease was called?
-Cholera.

889
02:39:44,920 --> 02:39:47,912
It just comes up again.

890
02:39:57,880 --> 02:40:02,635
Did you get anything else?
No bread or anything?

891
02:40:02,760 --> 02:40:07,709
We should be wary of the ships food.
The disease could come from there.

892
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:11,674
Put it away,
where no one can see it, Robert.

893
02:40:34,320 --> 02:40:38,438
We must buy milk!

894
02:42:04,080 --> 02:42:11,634
Lord. . . you have said I should have no
other Gods but you.

895
02:42:11,760 --> 02:42:19,075
But I worshiped my daughter. And now
you've taken my idol away from me.

896
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:24,228
I thank you my lord and saviour.

897
02:43:19,080 --> 02:43:25,269
respected sir,
how can l reach Taylor's falls?

898
02:43:25,400 --> 02:43:28,915
how can we reach Taylor's falls?

899
02:43:30,600 --> 02:43:36,516
-how can l reach Taylor's falls?
-I don't really understand.

900
02:43:38,400 --> 02:43:43,076
how can l reach Taylor's falls?

901
02:43:43,200 --> 02:43:47,830
So you're going to Taylor's falls?
That's about three days walk form here.

902
02:43:47,960 --> 02:43:53,398
But I wouldn't travel in weather like this.

903
02:43:53,520 --> 02:43:58,958
At least I would get dry before setting off.

904
02:43:59,080 --> 02:44:06,077
-What did he say? What did he say?
-He said something about the weather.

905
02:44:06,200 --> 02:44:10,557
-What did you ask him?
-For directions to Taylor's falls.

906
02:44:10,680 --> 02:44:15,549
-And what did he say?
-Something about the weather.
I'll ask someone else.

907
02:44:15,680 --> 02:44:18,638
did it say that in the book?

908
02:44:25,520 --> 02:44:32,517
-''can l help you?''
-No, just take a seat and relax.

909
02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:40,355
Everything is wet.

910
02:44:43,600 --> 02:44:47,434
I've never seen a man so handy around the house.

911
02:44:47,560 --> 02:44:52,714
No, that's the kindest and good hearted
man I have ever met.

912
02:44:52,800 --> 02:44:56,349
You wouldn't think he was a priest.

913
02:45:50,440 --> 02:45:55,355
-''Mr Andres Mansson''. . .
- Anders Månsson, yes.

914
02:45:55,480 --> 02:46:00,793
-''Taylor's falls post office.''
- Does he know Anders Månsson?

915
02:46:00,920 --> 02:46:06,711
Taylor's falls post office.
Taylor's falls. . . that is very close.

916
02:46:07,720 --> 02:46:12,874
Close. It is close. . . to here.

917
02:46:12,960 --> 02:46:16,589
I think it is close.

918
02:46:16,720 --> 02:46:22,670
It's very close. . .
I would like to. . .

919
02:46:22,800 --> 02:46:28,432
''what distance is it from here?''

920
02:46:28,560 --> 02:46:32,439
Two days.

921
02:46:32,560 --> 02:46:37,918
Maybe three with the children.

922
02:46:38,040 --> 02:46:44,149
Three days, and you will have to walk.

923
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:08,869
Hey, Robert? When we get there I'm not
staying with Danjel any longer.

924
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:14,757
-What are you going to do?
-Seek a place with some nobility.

925
02:49:14,880 --> 02:49:21,149
-I won't stay with Karl Oskar.
-What are you going to do?

926
02:49:21,280 --> 02:49:28,675
Certainly not become a farm hand.
I want to go west, to California.

927
02:49:28,800 --> 02:49:32,793
California? What is there?

928
02:49:39,640 --> 02:49:43,758
You have to promise not to tell anyone.

929
02:49:43,880 --> 02:49:46,474
I promise.

930
02:49:58,920 --> 02:50:02,629
-Am I hurting you?
-No, it's my ear.

931
02:50:02,760 --> 02:50:06,992
-It comes from time to time.
-Does it howl as much as before?

932
02:50:07,120 --> 02:50:11,989
Does it howl? Let me hear?

933
02:50:12,120 --> 02:50:14,793
You can try.

934
02:50:20,280 --> 02:50:24,398
-Can you hear it?
-Yes.

935
02:50:48,200 --> 02:50:53,513
Our Lord, we thank you for our daily bread.

936
02:50:59,960 --> 02:51:06,798
and for a new land which has
opened its gates to us,-

937
02:51:06,920 --> 02:51:14,235
- and we have come here to
live and prosper in peace.

938
02:51:14,360 --> 02:51:18,990
but we would have been as newly born lambs-

939
02:51:19,120 --> 02:51:24,274
-had you not protected and guided us oh lord.

940
02:51:24,400 --> 02:51:32,990
Oh ever lasting you, who's hand

941
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:40,390
reaches out from generation to generation,
from land to land

942
02:51:40,520 --> 02:51:47,870
and protects the world from harm

943
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:55,839
in the morning the flowers open

944
02:51:55,960 --> 02:52:03,514
but die before the end of day

945
02:52:03,640 --> 02:52:10,796
and her rich bounty

946
02:52:10,920 --> 02:52:17,837
is the people on this earth

947
02:53:01,880 --> 02:53:06,271
Surely no one can live here? It's an outhouse.

948
02:53:26,120 --> 02:53:29,396
Can you explain it to him?

949
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:32,671
we want to buy milk.

950
02:53:32,800 --> 02:53:38,875
Have you no manners, boy?
Put down the gun !

951
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:45,394
What are you doing with the gun in the outhouse?
-Mother?

952
02:53:45,520 --> 02:53:48,159
You come unexpected.

953
02:53:48,280 --> 02:53:52,114
I never thought we would make it.

954
02:53:55,160 --> 02:54:00,359
Where is dad? Is he dead?

955
02:54:00,480 --> 02:54:06,635
He is dead like all the others
at the bottom of the sea.

956
02:54:06,760 --> 02:54:14,155
Here you can see our iron pot.
One of the feet have come off.

957
02:54:14,280 --> 02:54:18,034
And you have our old kettle.

958
02:54:18,160 --> 02:54:22,711
oh yes. . .

959
02:54:25,720 --> 02:54:31,113
But come in, come in. Everyone from Sweden.

960
02:54:31,240 --> 02:54:35,791
Thank. It's been a long journey.
Good that we found you.

961
02:54:35,920 --> 02:54:42,234
-Why are you living in the outhouse?
-This is my house, Mother.

962
02:54:42,360 --> 02:54:46,069
This?

963
02:54:46,200 --> 02:54:52,514
But, Anders, you wrote.
Are you tricking your old mother?

964
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:55,791
Show us your farm !

965
02:54:58,440 --> 02:55:02,115
Come in now.

966
02:55:17,280 --> 02:55:19,953
Mother?

967
02:55:23,040 --> 02:55:25,873
Mother!

968
02:55:47,600 --> 02:55:53,550
Nice forest over there.

969
02:55:57,000 --> 02:56:01,676
And we could make a road up there.

970
02:56:14,160 --> 02:56:18,278
There is two feet of top soil here as well.

971
02:56:18,400 --> 02:56:24,555
Our lords sun has never
shone down on a more beautiful landscape.

972
02:56:24,680 --> 02:56:28,229
Any it would be difficult to find better
farm land in all of creation.

973
02:56:28,360 --> 02:56:33,434
It's a mosquito hole.
With swampy beaches, both here. . .

974
02:56:33,560 --> 02:56:38,475
-You're never satisfied, Karl Oskar.
-We have walked far enough.

975
02:56:38,600 --> 02:56:42,673
We'll stay here. the is
plenty of space for all three of us.

976
02:56:42,800 --> 02:56:48,557
-But it might be better up ahead.
-We should thank the lord for what we have here.

977
02:56:48,680 --> 02:56:53,310
If you're not happy with this spot,
then your just being plain picky.

978
02:56:56,040 --> 02:56:59,555
By the other lake you said things were even better.

979
02:56:59,680 --> 02:57:03,036
-By Ki-Chi-Saga?
-Yes, exactly.

980
02:57:03,160 --> 02:57:09,076
I don't know. There aren't many
who have gone that far in.

981
02:57:09,200 --> 02:57:14,194
If we've moved over a 1000 miles,
surely we can travel one more mile to have a look.

982
02:57:14,320 --> 02:57:17,198
Ki-Chi-Saga. . .

983
02:57:18,760 --> 02:57:23,470
There, now they can see that
the land has been claimed.

984
02:57:31,160 --> 02:57:35,438
The greenest fields are always
those furthest away.
