00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,920
A Dariusz Jab³oñski film

2
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,520
Based on the book

3
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:53,920
STRAWBERRY WINE

4
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,760
Where's the police station?

5
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,440
What do you need
the station for?

6
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,960
He's only had a few.

7
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,160
I'm going to the police station.
Him you can keep.

8
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,600
It's like this, Lubica,
the womenfolk are complaining...

9
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,000
This better be the last time:

10
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,760
If you've got the itch to lead
your neighbor into temptation,

11
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,280
then do it in private.

12
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,080
Right then.
Get out of here and be good.

13
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,720
Distinctions, awards...

14
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,160
So what's the deal?

15
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,080
Honestly now:
Who sent you?

16
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,760
Regional command?
HQ maybe?

17
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,680
- Personal reasons, sergeant.
- But here?

18
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,980
In the middle of nowhere:?

19
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,500
I wanted a job as far away
from the capital as possible.

20
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,640
Well this is about
as far as it gets.

21
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,300
I applied for staff because
I'm due for retirement next year.

22
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,440
But from the capital???
Things are a bit different around here,

23
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,040
but you'll get the hang of it soon.

24
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,600
Now to find you
something to do...

25
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,320
Area's pretty big,
but sparsely populated though.

26
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,920
You'll see for yourself tomorrow.

27
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,720
You'll take the company...
bicycle.

28
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,720
In the morning you'll go and patrol
state property undergoing liquidation.

29
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,200
Right here.

30
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,000
We'll quarter you
at citizen Lewandowski's.

31
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,360
Used to live there myself.

32
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,280
What're you staring at?

33
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,560
Ain't nothing wrong with her.

34
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,680
How do you know?

35
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,000
I can see.

36
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,600
Want me to carve 'er up for you,
Wasylczuk?

37
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,120
I'll carve 'er up myself.
Don't like killing 'em is all.

38
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,500
I do. Main thing's for the critter
not to get scared.

39
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,040
Bad job spoils the meat.

40
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,680
Reeks of fear...

41
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,000
Stay away from my woman.

42
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,240
My woman doesn't need any help.

43
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,920
You were away a long time.

44
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,560
She said she did.

45
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,120
No.

46
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,000
You better get married,
Semen,

47
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:41,240
rather than helping out
folks all over the village.

48
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,560
Playing matchmaker?

49
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,520
I hide them if I don't know
who's coming.

50
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,080
That'll do.
Pass me a towel.

51
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,560
- Do you want some food?
- No. Have to work on the cart.

52
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,440
- Tomorrow. Get some rest.
- I'm heading off tomorrow.

53
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,720
- You just got back.
- I'm going to work.

54
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,920
What do you see in those woods?

55
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,400
God,
you live like a wolf.

56
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,280
What is there to see here?
Got anything special to show me?

57
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,040
You used to be different...

58
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,480
That's what you think.
I'm the way I always was:

59
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,440
I'm off tomorrow.
He'd better not come here.

60
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,280
Leave him out of this.
He's a good man.

61
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,240
Tell him to take his goodness

62
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,240
somewhere else.

63
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,160
Done.

64
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,160
This'll fix anything.
So long as it's rubber.

65
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,880
Inner tubes, galoshes,
padded boots.

66
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,760
Those were the days when
the state farms were still around.

67
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,240
State farm here, one over in Ni¿na,
one up in Mosczaniec...

68
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,320
...ten tractors in every farm,

69
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,160
four wheels on every tractor,

70
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,240
trailers, too...

71
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,100
Menfolk, womenfolk, kids...

72
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,320
...each of 'em with two legs,
galoshes on both,

73
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,480
not counting spares.

74
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,680
Now it's just farmers
and poor folk.

75
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,080
Patch 'em up themselves.

76
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,400
Sell me some cigarettes?

77
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,520
Not yet...

78
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,000
Someday.

79
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,740
No, thanks.

80
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,360
No need to thank me.
Wine's like wine.

81
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,580
Used to make 'em better though.
Three bottles and you were gone.

82
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,520
This just makes you want to piss.

83
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,520
"Strawberry Wine".

84
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,720
That's Pop.
No... that's Ma,

85
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,040
and that's Pop,

86
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,480
and that's me.

87
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,060
Got sent down here in '77.

88
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,400
Doing four years costs you no tears,
and leaves no smears.

89
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,560
I herded cows, fired bricks,
dug ditches, chopped trees.

90
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,460
- For what?
- My belief.

91
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,500
I believed they wouldn't nick me.

92
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,280
Then I got out and it
was more of the same:

93
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,800
Timber, animals, ditches...

94
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,300
Is it bad here?

95
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,000
Worse than anywhere else?

96
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,920
That's Olena.
Ruthenian girl.

97
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,720
We got married
in an Orthodox church.

98
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,400
This house...
for the two of us.

99
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,600
Six years ago...

100
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,920
That bar at 10,
Grochowska street, Warsaw

101
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,320
it still exist?

102
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,880
Now have you ever seen a police station
closed during the day?

103
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,640
Bless you my son:

104
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,140
You must be the new one.
Just like your boss.

105
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,280
Two weeks now and
I still haven't seen you in church.

106
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,960
I don't go.

107
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,040
I don't believe in God.

108
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,260
Not much at any rate.

109
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,780
Never mind.

110
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,440
Views don't have to stop
you coming to Mass.

111
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,180
Though your boss still has
the same views

112
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,560
he had under communism.
They won't let him enter a church.

113
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,140
He's never been...

114
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,000
I...
might come one of these days.

115
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Nothing more I can do here.

116
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,120
Secular authority

117
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,360
should not be seen fraternizing
with spiritual authority.

118
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,800
That's the way it's always been,
and it's for the better.

119
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,160
- Surely not always?
- You might think not, but it has.

120
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,360
A man has to know whom to listen to
in different sides of life.

121
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,620
But the police is getting along well
with the Church now, isn't it?

122
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,320
Prayer doesn't improve
the clear-up rate any.

123
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,320
The times we had back then,
my boy:

124
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,680
Politics is a clash of ideas...

125
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,560
You wouldn't understand today.

126
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,200
Seventeen years waiting
for a crown.

127
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,320
Well?

128
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,840
It's sort of...

129
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,360
Come quick:

130
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,640
What are you waiting for?
Hop on:

131
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,360
Stop:

132
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,700
Stop:

133
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:16,900
To the bar: : :
Stop:

134
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,040
To the bar: : :

135
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,360
I'm telling you: Stop:

136
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,960
What are you doing?
Stop:

137
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,240
You will be mine: : :

138
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,680
Come on:
Where are you going? :

139
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,360
Turn it off, you f...
I'm telling you, turn it off:

140
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,680
Let it go:
Shit:

141
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,260
Doesn't count. You were supposed
to drive up to the counter.

142
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,360
But don't worry.
You'll make it next time, Janek.

143
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,520
Going to take my clothes?

144
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,100
Back home in Slovakia
when I was a girl

145
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,020
the boys would play that game.

146
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,600
Everybody went down
to the river to bathe

147
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,460
and hid everyone else's clothes.
Girls would take the boys' clothes, either.

148
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,040
They don't anymore?

149
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,620
There's no boys or girls left.

150
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,080
Either they've moved to the city
or they're just born old.

151
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,680
I'm cold.
Turn around.

152
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,600
Ready.

153
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,920
What are you doing?

154
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,400
Promoting you to general...

155
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,880
...so you won't be afraid
of anything.

156
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,560
I'm not even a constable.

157
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,000
Are you married?

158
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,760
No.
Not any more.

159
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,280
Can you still tell?

160
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,280
Do you miss her?

161
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
No.

162
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,240
Not her.
Just...

163
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,840
my daughter.

164
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,920
Where is she?

165
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,560
She's gone.

166
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,480
I don't stand a chance,
do I?

167
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,480
It's dry.

168
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,640
I like it better when it's wet.

169
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,160
Well it's not anymore.

170
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,400
Tough job with her.

171
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,500
She's not from around here.

172
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,700
I know that much.
Where is she from?

173
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,240
Thereabouts.

174
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,840
At the back of beyond.
Slovakia.

175
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,280
Her mother died,
she ran away

176
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,920
and came here
to look for her father,

177
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,820
a Pole who was supposed to have spent
one night at her mother's place.

178
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,560
She's not happy here either.
One guy tried to hang

179
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,140
himself because of her
and you saw what Janek did.

180
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,160
They'll book him for sure.

181
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,480
Did she find her father?

182
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,000
Maybe she did
and maybe she didn't.

183
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,420
How come you're out here?

184
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,320
Player doesn't work.
Head's busted.

185
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,120
Neat, huh?

186
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,120
Neat.

187
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,440
No sweat.

188
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,600
It's American.
Quick-drying.

189
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,280
How 'bout you, you know,

190
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,680
get around to him a bit
the way you do.

191
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,500
It's always good to know
what's going down.

192
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,640
You're a real pig,
you know that?

193
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,320
Pig or no pig...

194
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,600
Hurry up or we'll be late.

195
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,480
I have to change.

196
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,120
Waste of fuel, buddy.

197
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,280
Well?
All quiet?

198
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,120
There was a scuffle
but I calmed them down.

199
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,000
Took this away from them.
They wanted to cut up the tables.

200
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,960
We're smoking here,
but we're actually exhaling thataway.

201
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,400
Join us, won't you?

202
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,000
Mix it with soda
and no one'll know.

203
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,200
No thanks.
Some other time.

204
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,200
It didn't hurt him none.

205
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,679
Wasylczuk.

206
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,920
If I'd just sat down for a while
in the bar...

207
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,080
Then you'd have stayed there.
When he gets something in

208
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,880
his head there's no stopping
him no matter what.

209
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,120
Kociejny sure is something.

210
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,220
They don't make 'em
like that anymore.

211
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,160
There was nothing
you could have done.

212
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,460
But if I hadn't stepped outside...

213
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,720
If you think
he'd have let a uniform stop him

214
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,640
you're too dumb to even be a cop.

215
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,560
GREAT OPENING

216
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,840
Hoosteller please.

217
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,640
I beg your pardon?

218
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,400
Cigarettes.

219
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,840
Carry on? :

220
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
Keep it up:

221
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,080
See.

222
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,800
Soon as you come here
this tragedy happens.

223
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,320
Screwed up our figures.

224
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,140
Lucky it's not just the crime
rate that went up.

225
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,600
The clear-up rate followed suit.

226
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,500
One could say you apprehended

227
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,600
the culprit red-handed.
That counts for something.

228
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,960
I didn't apprehend him.
He turned himself in.

229
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,000
Doesn't matter.
Main thing is you were on the scene.

230
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,260
Irka:
Turn them frogs off:

231
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,040
They are Italians, Edek.

232
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,540
That's what I said.

233
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,540
Turn it off
and play something in English.

234
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,840
What's the difference?

235
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,680
Might be all the same to you.

236
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,000
It isn't to me.

237
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,900
When I was in da hood in Noo Yawk,
we had this def gig...

238
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,940
The Man sent a homey down
in a chine and we cruised up

239
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,580
Park into the Upper West Side
where we hogged mainlines...

240
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,560
What's a mainline?

241
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,800
Cause you've always been
a great one for hogging.

242
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,840
A mainline...
is a mainline.

243
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,120
Five bucks a yard.

244
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,120
Don't they have excavators
over there?

245
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:15,360
Sure. But that was specialized
hazardous hogging.

246
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,560
So Zalatywój,
how's business?

247
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,100
What exactly is hogging?

248
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,280
Ask him.
I've never been much for English.

249
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,340
What is it? :

250
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,720
Ditches, shovels, digging:

251
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,680
...and pigs will fly.
Buy me a wine, will you.

252
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,720
It's pointless.

253
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,840
Don't even pay for fuel.

254
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,000
Delivered three pairs today,

255
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,240
got two to fix up...

256
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,200
Yo:
Zalatywój:

257
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,160
I asked you
how's business:

258
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,200
Yo:
Zalatywój...

259
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,280
you Gypsy mutha...

260
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,640
- I'll pass by Dukla.
- You do that.

261
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,480
- What time do you get off?
- In the evening. Then I'm out of here.

262
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,140
He was supposed to take you
away from all this.

263
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,760
He did.
Took me to Dukla.

264
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,560
What do you want?

265
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,200
I thought
you wanted more than that.

266
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,800
Shouldn't have missed
your chance.

267
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:13,640
- Meet me down by the river tonight.
- I'm a married woman now, Andrzej.

268
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,560
Winter here always like this?

269
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,000
Not by a long shot.
Just off to a slow start this year.

270
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,880
- A horse.
- I don't see no horse.

271
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,800
Looks like yours.

272
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,220
Not a chance...

273
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,040
- Hauling timber, too.
- What timber?

274
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,040
Mietek?

275
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,160
Does the forest ranger
know about this?

276
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,980
How would I know
what he knows?

277
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,780
Man,
if you want to freeze your ass off,

278
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,340
then I'll tell him to take it back,
all right?

279
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,860
But if you want it warm,
then get your jacket on,

280
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,600
we'll chop it up,
and that's that.

281
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:46,800
- But I'm a policeman.
- Get over it...

282
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,680
You'll freeze.

283
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:37,680
- This the only one there was, Chief?
- I kinda like it. It's old stock.

284
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,320
Back then even the Christmas
decorations were official issue.

285
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,440
Yes...

286
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,960
yes,

287
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,680
yes sir.

288
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:20,200
Well... Kociejny's got a pass
for Christmas.

289
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:23,000
Yellow alert for us.

290
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,060
Well, Kociejny?
Home for the holidays, huh?

291
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,540
How much leave'd they give you?
Two days, three?

292
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,040
For good behavior?

293
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,960
So what's it like inside?
Just wondering, you know.

294
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,520
Must be interesting I bet.

295
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,580
When I was in Grinpoint...

296
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,200
Go and see for yourself.

297
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,300
Don't cost nothing.

298
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,640
Guys like me don't go.
We got this.

299
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,840
Cash flow, margins, accounts.

300
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,040
Affairs of the heart are
out of style.

301
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,480
I got married, by the way.

302
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,840
She's too good for you.

303
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,480
- That's it?
- That's it.

304
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,280
Quiet as a lamb.

305
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,160
Not going home for the holidays?

306
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,680
I don't have a home.

307
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,880
Then...

308
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,560
Merry Christmas:

309
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,920
Merry Christmas:

310
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,480
Merry Christmas...

311
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,600
Merry Christmas:

312
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,520
Merry Christmas: :

313
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,360
Merry Christmas:

314
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,720
Same to you...
Got papers for that?

315
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,020
They say that tonight the lion
shall lie down with the lamb,

316
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:15,600
and you want papers...
Merry Christmas:

317
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,760
- A Merry Christmas to you, Irena:
- Same to you, Andrzej, same to you:

318
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,120
Have a seat officer.

319
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,240
Christmas...

320
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,080
Irka:
Get a glass over here:

321
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,640
Bet they'll be locking up soon.

322
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,400
You know, officer,

323
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:28,320
you can see a fair piece of sky
from my cell.

324
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,120
There's an airport nearby.

325
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,480
When the weather's good the planes
up there look like gold crosses.

326
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,820
Crosses?

327
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:45,360
Like the ones you wear on your neck,
you know...

328
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,160
I've never been on a plane.
What about you?

329
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,360
I have.

330
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,360
- High up?
- I guess. Above the clouds.

331
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,440
What's it like up there?

332
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,120
Beats me.
Blue.

333
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,280
Like heaven kind of.
Peaceful.

334
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,640
Were you afraid?

335
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,760
I was.

336
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,260
But it's a different sort of fear.

337
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,620
Like you were watching
yourself from far away

338
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,940
and only knew
that the other you was scared.

339
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,800
It's like fear but it isn't.

340
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:34,720
Like looking at yourself from far off,
you say?

341
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,320
Something like that.

342
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,600
You still sore at me?

343
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,440
No.

344
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,680
I blame myself.

345
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,400
That's good.

346
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,680
Man should blade himself
for everything.

347
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:05,880
I'm here for him to tell me
what it's like.

348
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,160
Who?

349
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,640
Him.

350
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,280
This is from me.

351
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,120
Monarchs.

352
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:53,320
They can fly up
to six thousand kilometers,

353
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,920
and yet they look so fragile.

354
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,520
Went by the river the other day.

355
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,120
Frozen over.

356
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,200
Might thaw in the spring.

357
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,080
I didn't know
you could make pierogi too, Mietek.

358
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,160
You'd be surprised
at what I can do...

359
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,780
So how come you
never do anything?

360
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,940
Don't feel like it I guess.

361
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:42,100
It's not that I'm lazy,
only a bit here and a bit there

362
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:45,680
don't make for anything permanent.

363
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,200
Same with everybody here.

364
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,680
It's the weather.

365
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,440
Work's like weather.
It changes.

366
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:01,360
I spent seven years
working in one place.

367
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,200
Every day?

368
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,840
Yup.
In an office.

369
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,160
Good job,
you don't get dirty.

370
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,440
Just sleepy.

371
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,940
I wouldn't mind working
but all I can do is drive a tractor.

372
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,360
Not much demand for that lately.

373
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,200
To each his own.

374
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,840
Damn it:

375
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,040
On Christmas Eve?

376
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,220
We didn't have electricity
in ¯³obiska thirty years back.

377
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,300
Folks saw more then, too.

378
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,700
Get outta here.
I don't want to swear on a holiday,

379
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,500
but you're talking rubbish.

380
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:53,120
They did too.
Take my granny: Saw something every day.

381
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,800
Like what?

382
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:00,760
All sorts of things...
Don't you believe in that?

383
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:05,800
These things are beyond our grasp
and should stay that way,

384
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:09,500
otherwise
they wouldn't be there at all.

385
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,860
My grandma knew all about it.

386
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:16,460
In broad daylight she saw things
others didn't even see at night.

387
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:21,960
She stopped seeing
when they hooked up the power.

388
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,400
Glad tidings:

389
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,420
Egyptian darkness
all the way down to Dukla.

390
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,380
Candles in windows everywhere.

391
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,000
And me with three pairs of boots
to deliver.

392
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,800
- On Christmas Eve?
- If it's urgent it's urgent.

393
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,760
Let me have a nip,
I'm freezing.

394
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,440
Should do something about the chassis
for the winter.

395
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,160
...you're the one,

396
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:40,280
Now you've gone
and left me crying bitter tears,

397
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:46,920
When I met you,
you were barely seventeen,

398
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:54,560
I remember seeing you
down by the lake.

399
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:02,520
And you told me
that your name was Beata,

400
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:10,200
So enchanting was
the beauty of that name.

401
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:17,880
Every day that summer
I would take you sailing

402
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:26,320
And your love it did
engulf me like a flame...

403
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,040
Dammit...

404
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,360
...just like Midnight Mass...

405
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,440
I'm not seeing this.

406
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,000
- I'm not seeing this at all.
- Of course not.

407
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,640
It's foggy out.

408
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,500
Same deal as usual,
Chestnut.

409
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:54,660
Mosey on down thataway,
and take the second right.

410
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,900
I'll take the roundabout way
and be back home half an hour after you.

411
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Anybody meets you,
mum's the word.

412
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,980
What do you know,
froze to death.

413
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,880
So hot-blooded and all.

414
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,680
This is all that's left
of the Orthodox church.

415
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,440
They took it to a museum.

416
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,280
This was the presbytery.

417
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,880
And this was the nave.

418
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,240
And you're standing
on the threshold.

419
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:12,200
You're giving off a chill.

420
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,680
Froze to death,
didn't I?

421
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,760
But it's warm.
You should have thawed.

422
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,440
You only die once,
can't change anything later.

423
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,900
Looks like you can,
since you're sitting here.

424
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,040
I am and I'm not.

425
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:29,480
So why'd you come here?

426
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:38,480
Wanted to talk.

427
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,340
You know,
it's not so bad over there,

428
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,360
can't complain,

429
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,920
but, well...

430
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,080
And the silence...

431
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,940
Have you seen your wife?

432
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:58,920
Didn't notice me then,
wouldn't notice me now.

433
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:07,760
- Gotta be going.
- Go then.

434
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,400
But I have to lock up the station.

435
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,080
I'm a ghost, remember?

436
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:27,699
By the way: You wouldn't happen to know
whether there's a pigsticking in the area?

437
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:29,799
You get around.

438
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:35,799
Pigsticking's what I miss
the most over there.

439
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:52,920
- And the detergents?
- What about them?

440
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,160
- How're they moving?
- Moving, I guess.

441
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,560
- What kind sells best?
- Don't remember.

442
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:04,680
- So what are you doing there, then?
- What are you asking stupid questions for?

443
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,680
The cheapest kind sells best.

444
01:09:17,799 --> 01:09:19,520
Stop that:

445
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,540
- What should I get for tomorrow?
- Whatever.

446
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,279
What is this? :
You doing me a favor here? :

447
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,080
I'm bored.

448
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:33,160
What with?

449
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,960
All this.

450
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:43,480
Look out: : :

451
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:46,200
For God's sake:

452
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,280
Tried to kill me:
Didn't even slow down.

453
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:29,420
- Mietek?
- Nah. Edek. On the Dukla road.

454
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,120
- Didn't even look back.
- Report it tomorrow.

455
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:37,580
Can't. I was driving my rig.
It's like I wasn't there.

456
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:41,320
I had no right to be.
Still got the shakes though.

457
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:45,600
- Me too.
- So, how's about we...

458
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,660
Nothing here.

459
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,920
We'll go to the bar,
sit with other people.

460
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:50,080
What do you say:?
Money plus Lubica means a good time:

461
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,460
I didn't know
he could play that well.

462
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:12,020
All Gypsies can.
Well, nearly all of them.

463
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:16,160
- He's a Gypsy then?
- Maybe he is. Who cares.

464
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,940
- I'll come by the river if you want.
- I do.

465
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:31,080
I'll be there. Tomorrow.
I'll do everything tomorrow.

466
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,300
Eeny meeny miny mo...
Catch a tiger by the toe.

467
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,800
Lubiczka,
Lubiczka...

468
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,960
Must be a draft somewhere.

469
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:54,360
Lubiczko, I'd wash your feet
and drink the bath-water...

470
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:00,300
Had to pay a five grand fine
for driving up those steps...

471
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,480
It's not you I came back for,
Janek.

472
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,200
Stay:

473
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,480
You're all the same.

474
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:12,640
No, Janek,
someone waits for me by the river.

475
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,340
Not enough music for you?

476
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,920
- What music?
- Last night's.

477
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:27,300
- What do you mean?
- You know damn well what I mean.

478
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,520
Everybody saw you.

479
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:35,280
In broad daylight, polka-dancing
with that... Lubica.

480
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,720
Chief,

481
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,740
it was at night,

482
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:44,960
I was off duty.

483
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:52,600
Come quickly:

484
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,180
I can't remember a thing...

485
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,360
I don't know...

486
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,480
I don't remember...
I don't know how...

487
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:27,400
Couldn't catch up with it.

488
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:31,360
I wanted to catch some small-fry.

489
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:37,040
She liked to come here...

490
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:08,520
No chance of buying smokes
until they open the bar, bro.

491
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:19,840
Traded them in...

492
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:25,600
Life goes on, bro...

493
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,640
Life goes on.

494
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:55,200
Who called them?

495
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,260
He doesn't remember a thing.

496
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:04,520
How could he have called
if he was in shock?

497
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:17,080
If they couldn't get
the knife out of his hand...

498
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:21,720
how could he have made
a phone call?

499
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,280
It's not that obvious.

500
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,740
Not that obvious at all.

501
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:34,680
Someone had to make that phone call.
But who?

502
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,960
We don't know.
Somebody.

503
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:42,880
That much we know.
He called because no one else could have.

504
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:46,760
How could he have done
a thing like that?

505
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:49,080
Killing a man is one thing,

506
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,680
but a woman?
Lubica?

507
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:56,160
What'd she do to him?

508
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,400
Where did he call from?
Did anybody see him?

509
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:06,040
How can he know where he called from
if he can't remember a thing?

510
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:08,980
There are only three phones
in this shi... in our village.

511
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:12,200
- Over here and at the priest's house:
- The village head has the third one.

512
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:15,460
It's off the hook.
What are you driving at?

513
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,800
Nothing's going to
bring her back to life:

514
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:21,540
We have the victim,
we have the perpetrator,

515
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:25,960
we have clear-up,
and you want to play cops...

516
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,540
Actually I wanted to see you

517
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:21,060
and thought
the cemetery might be a good place.

518
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,360
Natural, wouldn't you say?

519
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:30,080
Why do you have to appear
to me of all people?

520
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,500
Because you're not
from around here.

521
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,920
And because
you don't really believe in me.

522
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,600
The others would straight away.

523
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:42,960
Can't smoke either.

524
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,120
I went to see the priest.

525
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,560
He was having a pork chop.

526
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,960
The aroma...

527
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:54,600
He see you?

528
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:58,920
Not on your life.
Didn't see me, didn't hear me, nothing.

529
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:05,240
If a specialist
can't see you then

530
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:08,000
maybe you don't exist after all.

531
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:10,540
He's no specialist
when it comes to ghosts.

532
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,980
Knows a thing or two
about people is all.

533
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:17,120
That makes me the expert...

534
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,520
So...

535
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:24,960
- Do you...
- You want to know who did it?

536
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,480
Yes.

537
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:31,800
When you got here
you didn't care about anything.

538
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:41,560
I'm old and tired.

539
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:46,280
I should come back...

540
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,400
Lights.

541
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,440
The healthy kind.

542
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,720
From the kiosk.

543
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:36,920
You bought things from her?

544
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,680
It wouldn't have been right.

545
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,880
I sent my housekeeper.

546
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:49,120
She stocked those...

547
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:53,240
Publications
of a pornographic nature.

548
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:57,920
But it's a freedom.

549
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,040
That's it.

550
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:15,400
Poor soul gone astray.

551
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,960
Poor lambkin.

552
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:24,360
Souls will stray
when you set them free.

553
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:30,160
Quite so, quite so.

554
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:37,160
- Shall I take them inside now? :
- Let them air a while longer.

555
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:46,400
I've been a priest
for twenty eight years now.

556
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:50,760
I spent twenty six years
in the mili... police force.

557
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,280
It has to be done.

558
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:12,620
Either way it won't hurt,
even if it doesn't help,

559
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:15,700
and why shouldn't it help,
since it can help.

560
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:19,240
You said it.
Pass the hat.

561
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,340
That should do the trick...

562
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:29,480
Mietek, it's not like we're chipping
in to buy booze here. This is serious:

563
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:32,120
This is for me to do.

564
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:49,640
So, here you are.

565
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:57,360
I was having a nap.

566
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:00,620
They say you don't age in church.

567
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:05,640
Even if that's not true
you do sleep easier.

568
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,520
So, here you are.

569
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:10,840
Have a look.

570
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,360
Saint Catherine,

571
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,480
patron of the parish,

572
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:19,080
St. Florian,
patron saint of firemen.

573
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:22,560
And over there, if you prefer,
is the feretory with St. Joseph.

574
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,660
It's light enough
if four men spread the weight.

575
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:28,400
You're young and fit...

576
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:31,540
Yes but I've come
about something else.

577
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:34,600
Official business you might say.

578
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:37,200
He's waiting...

579
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,720
For it is written that:

580
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:44,780
"It is hard for thee
to kick against the pricks".

581
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,580
But you might
not be familiar with that.

582
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:51,480
If it's official business
let's go to the vicarage.

583
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:03,560
So what did he say exactly?

584
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:09,040
He said he was tired
and wants to go back there.

585
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:17,000
It's just not right:
Here one moment, there the next.

586
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:27,600
He could never stay put
when he was alive either.

587
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:29,740
Hot-blooded he was.

588
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:34,000
And he also said we had it all wrong
about the murder...

589
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,680
...that it wasn't Janek.

590
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:42,040
He said he'd tell me...

591
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:47,360
if I had a mass sung for him.

592
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,440
Put that away.

593
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:05,960
The intention's quite unusual.

594
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:12,440
You'll carry the feretory
one of these days.

595
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,780
- Well?
- Nice.

596
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:50,120
Sort of like
she was getting married.

597
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:53,840
Got it?
Pass it here, then.

598
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:57,400
Zalatywój wanted it that way...

599
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:38,440
It's like he's here
and yet he isn't, huh?

600
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:42,840
- You believe in all that?
- In all that what?

601
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:47,480
Well, the way things are over there,
that there is an over there, you know...

602
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,920
I guess I do when
I don't think about it.

603
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:55,200
When I start thinking about it
then I don't really know.

604
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:08,120
You keep hanging there

605
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:14,160
while we've got to figure
things out on our lonesome.

606
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:28,880
Relax.
No one can see me.

607
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:32,920
You go on ahead.
I'll be waiting by the church.

608
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:36,320
Look,
I don't even cast a shadow.

609
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:44,280
Got a watch?
I wouldn't want to be late.

610
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:47,120
We'll make it.

611
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:52,600
It begins at six.

612
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:00,640
You call this a mass?

613
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:04,160
Where's the people?
Where's the organist?

614
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:07,680
There's Mietek and W³adek...

615
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:12,340
I don't mean buddies,
I mean people.

616
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:16,080
Kociejny, get real.

617
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:23,080
It's Saturday,
where am I supposed to get people from?

618
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,720
I want a proper mass,

619
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:31,240
or else...

620
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,120
Everybody up:

621
01:35:57,240 --> 01:36:01,000
- Get up: I mean you:
- What for?

622
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:03,420
You know damn well what for,
don't think I forgot:

623
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,940
And you,
and you Radek too:

624
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:09,800
You're all under arrest:

625
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:15,720
Get a move on:

626
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:20,120
Move on:

627
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,440
What about the bill? :

628
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,520
Give me:

629
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:31,960
Come on, get moving:

630
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:39,320
Hurry up!
Hurry up!

631
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,600
Move it!
Hurry up!

632
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:54,480
Run for it!

633
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:56,800
Hurry!
Move it!

634
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:02,040
Hurry!
Hurry!

635
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,320
- Flat, huh?
- Flat, sure.

636
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:10,880
Fifth one this week.

637
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,840
It's autumn.
They're flying home.

638
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:30,320
What about the spring?
They fly to work?

639
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:33,860
You can never really tell
with geese,

640
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:37,120
but when you think about it...

641
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:45,840
Almost new:

642
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,600
Time does fly...

643
