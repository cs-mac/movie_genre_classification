I'm supposed to be dying.

74
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,690
Um, I've got a disease
called cancer.

We all die.

We all die.

Not pleasant, but we do.
It happens.

92
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,380
I could get hit
by a truck tomorrow.

93
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,110
Hopefully not a large truck.

99
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,940
If something like that did happen,
it would really be a drag

100
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,320
because there are a lot of things
I wanna tell you and say to you.

101

Uh...

There's not a lot you can trust in this world.
There just isn't.

So I wanted to leave
you this videotape,

104

you know something
about me, who I am.

106
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,280
Well, this is me.

Uh, let's... Look at this.

112
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,270
Oh, my goodness.

113
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,730

It's amazing.
How is that possible?

116
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,190
Who the heck is this guy? He looks
like a loose kind of guy, doesn't he?
It's amazing.
How is that possible?

Oh. Here's a picture
of me and my mom, Rose.

I was a natural disaster.

Oh, here you go. This is my dad.
Take note of that.

131
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:55,490
It's one of the few pictures
you'll see of my dad awake.

132

See what I mean? Look there.

Your mom sounded concerned.

447
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:02,910
Concerned?
If she loves me so much,

448
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:02,920
why doesn't she get on an airplane
and come on out here and see me?

You should call her.

I don't need to keep having
it over and over again.

458
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,170
Be grateful they're there.

459
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:14,180
Look. I spent 20 years
trying to get out of Detroit.
Be grateful they're there.

460
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,470
Look. I spent 20 years

461
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,380
I don't need to go back.

462
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,140
Paul's getting married.

463
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,380
You're kidding.

464
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,460
To whom?

465
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,550
I don't know. Anya something.
Your mom said she was lovely.

466
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:31,560
Anya. Yeah, that's perfect.

468
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,150
Probably in food services or
sanitation, somethin' like that.

469
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,160
It's April 21st. I thought
it might be nice if we went.

00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,820
You mean we're invited?

472
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:46,430
Look. Forget it. I'll probably
be dead by that time anyway.

473
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,650
Great. Then we'll have the perfect
excuse of not showing up.

474
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,450
Come on. We haven't
been there in four years.

475
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,100
Will you at least
think about it?

476
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,450
I'll see.

477
00:19:59,450 --> 00:19:59,460
We need family, Bob.
I'll see.

478
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,690
We need family, Bob.

479
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:00,700
It's true. If it wasn't for
my mom, who would I have?

Hmm?

482
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,850
You'd have me.

483
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,430
We got the lab
reports back this morning.

484
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,050
I'm sorry, Bob.
They don't look very good.

485
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:16,060
There's been no reduction
in tumor size or density.
I'm sorry, Bob.

We're losing ground, Bob.

have to face things as they are.

You have a spring
to look forward to.

have drugs to manage the pain.

something more I could say.

I'm gonna beat
this thing, Gail.

I'll beat it.

538
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,100
I know.

539
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,220
Look at this. This is crazy.

540
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,030

They can't even fix their own hallways.

551
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,500
That's what we're gonna find out.
Okay.

552
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,210
Here. 202.

553
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,920
Which of these things doesn't
belong here? Pick two.

554
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,080
Here. Read something.

555
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,400
Oh. Thanks.

Oh, good. Sports. Great.

558
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,330
I feel better already.
Let's go.

559
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,980
Mr. Jones?

560
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,080
Take off your shoes
and lie down.

561
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:47,820
How you doin'?

562
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:47,830
Look. Just so you know. I'm
looking for a miracle here, so...
How you doin'?

00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:51,630
Look. Just so you know. I'm
looking for a miracle here, so...

564
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,480
Do you believe in miracles?

565
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:53,490
I will if this works.
Do you believe in miracles?

567
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,680
Uh-huh. Very bad stomach, huh?

568
00:25:59,680 --> 00:25:59,690
You take too much Rolaids.

How'd you know that?

572
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,870
It fell out of
your pocket. Half empty.

573
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,260
Pretty good.

574
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,490
Mmm-hmm.

575
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,170
You had your appendix
out a long time ago.

576
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,830
You were a child.

577
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,520
Yes?

578
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,310
Four or five?

579
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,580
Five.

580
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:39,590
Five. That's what I thought.
Five.

581
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,600
Five. That's what I thought.

582
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,040
Aha. The tumors are here.

587
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,040
Mmm-hmm. The disease
comes from the kidneys.

588
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,370
Very sick.

589
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,800
You just get comfortable.

590
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,580
I work.

591
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,560
You must relax. Relax.

592
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,580
I am relaxed.

593
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:30,590
Where's Gail?
I am relaxed.

00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,280
Where's Gail?

595
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,410
What is that? That hurt.

596
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:34,420
You fight me.
What is that? That hurt.

597
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,030
You fight me.

You make it hard for me to do.

600
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,100
You hold too much anger inside.
It poisons you.

601
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,760
I'm not holdin' on to anything.

602
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:51,030
Do you want to carry so much
pain into your next life?

603
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:54,990
My next life?

604
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,130
The last second of your life

605
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:57,140
is the most important
moment of all.

A holy terror.

1241
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:42,720
How about when I was 10?
Oh, when you were four, yes.
A holy terror.

1242
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,280
How about when I was 10?

1243
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:44,290
You were different at 10.
How about when I was 10?

1244
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:46,040
You were different at 10.

1245
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,180
You used to disappear for
hours into the basement.

1246
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:48,190
You would play with your trains.
You had an erector set...
You used to disappear for
hours into the basement.

1247
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:52,150
You would play with your trains.
You had an erector set...

1248
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:53,400
We never saw you.

1249
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:57,500
Why? What happened?
Why did I disappear?

1250
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:59,410
You, uh...

1251
00:56:59,410 --> 00:56:59,420
You were ashamed of us by then.
You, uh...

1252
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:02,220
You were ashamed of us by then.

1253
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:02,230
You hid everything from us.
You were ashamed of us by then.

1254
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:04,630
You hid everything from us.

1255
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:06,510
You didn't bring
your friends home.

1256
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:06,520
One time, your mother came to the
school to talk to the teacher,
You didn't bring
your friends home.

1257
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:12,040
One time, your mother came to the
school to talk to the teacher,

1258
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:12,050
and you pretended
not to know her.
One time, your mother came to the
school to talk to the teacher,

1259
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:14,640
and you pretended
not to know her.

1260
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,660
Not to know your own mother.

1261
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:16,670
She cried for two days.
Not to know your own mother.

1262
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:18,100
She cried for two days.

1263
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,990
Dad, come on.
It's my wedding day.

1264
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:23,660
What'd I tell you? Every time we
get together this shit happens.

1265
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:23,670
Well, what do you think...
What'd I tell you? Every time we
get together this shit happens.

1266
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:25,810
Well, what do you think...

1267
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:25,820
I mean, why do you
think I did that?
Well, what do you think...

1268
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:28,140
I mean, why do you
think I did that?

1269
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:28,150
It was a long time ago.
I mean, why do you
think I did that?

1270
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:30,350
It was a long time ago.

1271
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:32,780
You always thought
you were too good for us.

1272
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:32,790
That was your problem.
You always thought
you were too good for us.

1273
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:34,510
That was your problem.

1274
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:37,840
I think that...

1275
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:39,980
I...

1276
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:43,020
I think your kid should know

1277
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,900
that his father was too
good for his own family,

1278
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:45,910
that the first chance
he gets, he runs away.
that his father was too
good for his own family,

1279
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:49,030
that the first chance

He changes his name,
and he doesn't ever come back.

he gets, he runs away.

1281
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,430
He changes his name,
and he doesn't ever come back.

1282
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:57,000
You know, you're
changing the subject.

1283
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,180
I'm sorry I brought it up.

1284
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:58,190
I'm not changing anything. You're the
one who changes things, "Jones".
I'm sorry I brought it up.

1285
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:02,690
I'm not changing anything. You're the
one who changes things, "Jones".

1286
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:02,700
What's the matter?
You don't like my name?
I'm not changing anything. You're the
one who changes things, "Jones".

1287
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,740
What's the matter?
You don't like my name?

1288
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:04,750
Your father's name?
Your grandfather's name?
What's the matter?
You don't like my name?

1289
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:07,520
Your father's name?
Your grandfather's name?

1290
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:07,530
I'm sorry. Please, Dad.
Just forget it, you know...
Your father's name?
Your grandfather's name?

1291
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:10,820
I'm sorry. Please, Dad.
Just forget it, you know...

1292
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,730
Change everything.
You run from everything.

1293
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:13,740
You know what?
Change everything.
You run from everything.

1294
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,560
You know what?

1295
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,520
I never ran.

1296
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:20,070
I never ran. I left!

1297
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:21,600
You know why? I wanted a life.

1298
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:21,610
You can't have
a life with your family?
You know why? I wanted a life.

1299
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:23,880
You can't have
a life with your family?

1300
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:28,990
If it wasn't for your wife, for her
phone calls, you'd be a dead man to us.

1301
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:29,000
That's the truth!
What do you want me to do?
If it wasn't for your wife, for her
phone calls, you'd be a dead man to us.

1302
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,270
That's the truth!
What do you want me to do?

1303
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:30,280
You want me to call and listen to
this same stuff over and over again?
That's the truth!
What do you want me to do?

1304
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:34,150
You want me to call and listen to
this same stuff over and over again?

1305
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:37,600
Why would I do... Why would
any rational person do that?

1306
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:37,610
A man who loves
his family calls them.
Why would I do... Why would
any rational person do that?

1307
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:39,840
A man who loves
his family calls them.

1308
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,910
Oh. Dad, he really
does love you.

1309
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,540
Not in my book.

1310
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:44,550
Don't tell me...
Not in my book.

1311
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:45,500
Don't tell me...

1312
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:45,510
Don't tell me about love, okay?
Don't tell me...

1313
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:46,870
Don't tell me about love, okay?

1314
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:46,880
You know why? Now
shut up for a minute.
Don't tell me about love, okay?

1315
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,850
You know why? Now
shut up for a minute.

1316
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:54,330
I've lived in Los Angeles
10 years.

1317
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,910
You never came to see me once.

1318
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:04,860
You never saw what kind
of business I made,

1319
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,520
what kind of life I live,

1320
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,880
so don't tell me about love.

1321
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:08,890
Come on, Bobbie.
You know Mom doesn't fly.
so don't tell me about love.

1322
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:12,220
Come on, Bobbie.
You know Mom doesn't fly.

1323
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,080
What about trains?

1324
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,540
It's too far.
I can't go that far.

1325
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:15,550
See? Exactly.
It's too far.
I can't go that far.

1326
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,050
See? Exactly.

1327
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,060
See?

1328
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:19,070
Now, maybe when
the baby is born.
See?

1329
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:21,070
Now, maybe when
the baby is born.

1330
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:21,080
Yeah. Right. Right.
Then I can come.
Now, maybe when
the baby is born.

1331
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,320
Yeah. Right. Right.
Then I can come.

1332
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:23,330
You know what? Forget it.
Yeah. Right. Right.
Then I can come.

1333
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:25,240
You know what? Forget it.

1334
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:29,150
We'd just hack over the same shit anyway.
It's boring.

1335
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:46,650
How do people's
lives come to this?

1336
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,660
I gotta tell you
something, Bobbie.

1337
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:57,530
I love you.

1338
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,620
I really do, but...

1339
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:04,210
You can be

1340
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:07,860
a stuck-up, arrogant son of a
bitch sometimes. You know that?

1341
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:09,010
I mean, you stopped
talking to me

1342
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:09,020
'cause I make a career
choice you don't approve of.
I mean, you stopped
talking to me

1343
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:12,300
'cause I make a career
choice you don't approve of.

1344
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:13,260
What kind of bullshit is that?

1345
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:15,630
That's not true, Paul.
You rejected me.

1346
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:18,480
Oh, man, I rejected
Los Angeles.

1347
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,680
I couldn't live
your life out there.

1348
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,820
I needed my family.
I needed my friends.

1349
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,660
All you cared about
was business.

1350
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:26,670
I was out there two weeks.
All you cared about
was business.

1351
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:28,740
I was out there two weeks.

1352
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:28,750
We had dinner, what, twice?
I was out there two weeks.

1353
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,920
We had dinner, what, twice?

1354
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:34,420
Even then I felt like a client.

1355
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:38,440
You could've had a job
starting at $60,000 a year.

1356
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:38,450
Instead, you chose
the junk business.
You could've had a job
starting at $60,000 a year.

1357
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:40,300
Instead, you chose
the junk business.

1358
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:44,160
Scrap metal, Bobbie.
It's called scrap metal.

1359
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:44,170
It's junk.
It's always been junk.
Scrap metal, Bobbie.
It's called scrap metal.

1360
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:46,890
It's junk.
It's always been junk.

1361
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:46,900
See, this is where we differ.
It's junk.
It's always been junk.

1362
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,260
See, this is where we differ.

1363
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:48,270
You always hated Dad
for being a junk man.
See, this is where we differ.

1364
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:51,240
You always hated Dad
for being a junk man.

1365
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,440
I always loved him
for being a hard worker.

1366
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,110
That's the difference.

1367
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:55,120
I never said I hated him.
That's the difference.

1368
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,780
I never said I hated him.

1369
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:59,240
Yeah, Bobbie, you have.

1370
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,370
Well, okay,
let's forget the semantics.

1371
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:02,380
Look, he's your dad
for God's sake. I mean...
Well, okay,
let's forget the semantics.

1372
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:05,840
Look, he's your dad
for God's sake. I mean...

1373
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,260
You used to bounce
up and down on his knee.

1374
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:10,600
You rode the train
together to Cleveland.

1375
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,920
I remember you used to talk about
that all the time as a kid,

1376
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:13,930
how he took you
on the Pullman car,
I remember you used to talk about
that all the time as a kid,

1377
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:18,150
how he took you
on the Pullman car,

1378
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:19,100
just the two of you.

1379
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:19,110
I still remember
the look in your eye.
just the two of you.

1380
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:21,930
I still remember
the look in your eye.

1381
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:26,410
What happened
to that look, Bobbie?

1382
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:31,560
I don't know.

1383
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:35,400
You know, it's funny,

1384
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:38,850
for all your complaining
about Dad,

1385
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:43,010
I get the sense you're gonna
turn out just like him.

1386
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,360
Well, I gotta go in.
I really do.

1387
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,980
I'm leaving for my
honeymoon in half an hour.

1388
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,830
You gotta show it
to them too, Bobbie.

1389
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:13,270
Maybe one day.

1390
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:13,280
They're not gonna be
around forever, you know.
Maybe one day.

1391
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,320
They're not gonna be
around forever, you know.

1392
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,630
It's leaving.

1393
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:32,960
Hey, wait!

1394
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:36,410
What's the matter?

1395
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:41,140

Are you all right?

1403
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,840
This is my last trip home.

1404
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:10,320
It's not getting any better.

1405

You don't have to tell me.
It's not getting any better.

It's still there.

1411
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:17,940
Right there.

1412
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:20,950
The anger. The fear.

1413
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:24,080
You are not
a very good student.

1414
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,900
Life is trying to teach you,

1415
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,500
but you don't listen.

1416

Opportunities come

What are you talking about?
I did exactly what you said.

I went to Detroit.
I went 2,000 miles.

1420
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:38,990
I saw my parents.

1421

I did not tell you
to see your parents.
I saw my parents.

1423
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:45,030

you needed to forgive.

01:03:56,930 --> 01:03:59,180
Great. My heart.

1430
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:03,760
How exactly does one get there?

1431
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,620
Feel in the center
of your chest.

1432
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:11,620
Imagine your finger
pushing into it,

1433
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,500
deeper and deeper.

1434
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:13,510
When you start to feel happy,
deeper and deeper.

That is the place of love
you are there.

That is the place of love

1441
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,320
and forgiveness.

1442
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:30,310

Yeah. I'm sorry.

1565

That was
a spontaneous emission,
Yeah. I'm sorry.

You're an amazing woman,

I must be. I live with you.

1573
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:11,530
Am I really that difficult?

1574
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:14,030
Some things
you don't want to know.

1575
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:21,450
I love you.

Okay?

1648
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:59,560
Well, maybe you should
start on the Tilt-A-Whirl.

1649
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,130
No, no, no.

1650
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:03,490

Some things you just
gotta do alone, hon.

01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,910
Good luck.

1655
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,210
You ever been
on a coaster before?

1656

Not since I was six.
I've been too afraid.

But... Oh!

1674
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:41,110
Just a few more drops,
but really great ones!

1675
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:57,020
You can let go now.

1676
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:02,230
My hero.

1677
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:07,380
Hey, you did it.

1678
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:08,660
A snap.

Okay, now, the important thing to

01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:49,820
"Hi, Brian. Brian Jones."

1727
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:52,030
Do it. But ever since Cary
Grant and Fred Astaire died,

1728
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:52,040
there are very few guys
who can pull that off.

What?

1733
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:03,450
My contractions have started.

1734
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:04,340
I can't hear you. What?

1735
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:04,350
I'm having contractions.
I can't hear you. What?

Oh, damn! What are you doing?

1742
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:15,990
I forgot the camera. Oh.
Oh, damn! What are you doing?

01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:19,000
This is great. That's it.

1746
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,320
Oh, God! Oh, God! Okay, okay. How you doin'?
Good. That's it.

1747
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:22,330
Can you turn this way

Shut up!
Okay, all right. Sorry.

but her contractions
are getting further apart.

1782
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:20,170
We need for them
to be closer together

1783
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:21,860
and more regular to make progress.
Right.

1784
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:21,870
I'd like to start pitocin,
which will increase

1796
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:39,940
Hey, Doctor! How do you

- Bob, grab your camera.
- What?

1806
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:04,610
The baby's head is crowning. How often
do you get to see your baby being born?

1807
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:06,690
- Can you hold her?
- Sure.

1808
01:19:06,690 --> 01:19:06,700
Okay, Gail.

Yeah? Look at him.
I don't get it.

1942

I hate to be the one
to tell you this, but...

It's going too fast.

1995

I want him in my bed.

I want him in my bed.

It's not the same. I know.

2039
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,300
Oh, Mom.

2040
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:28,320
So this friend of mine
introduces me to your mother.

2041
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,590
And at first,

2042
01:30:30,590 --> 01:30:30,600
nothing in me responded to her.
And at first,

2043
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:33,860
nothing in me responded to her.

2044
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:37,950
Maybe I was intimidated
by how beautiful she was.

2045
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:40,600
I kept saying to myself,

2046
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:40,610
"She's too tall, too skinny.
I kept saying to myself,

2047
01:30:40,610 --> 01:30:43,520
"She's too tall, too skinny.

2048
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:47,290
"She knows too much
about public relations."

2049
01:30:47,290 --> 01:30:50,010
But she had, uh,

2050
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:50,020
compassion,
and she was really open.
But she had, uh,

2051
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:54,330
compassion,
and she was really open.

2052
01:30:54,330 --> 01:30:59,550
Even then, though,
I didn't think it was love.

2053
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:04,360
I just liked her.
I just really liked her.

2054
01:31:06,910 --> 01:31:09,300
She made me feel good.

2055
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:09,310
And I felt whole, somehow.
She made me feel good.

2056
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:13,820
And I felt whole, somehow.

2057
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:18,710
Then one day I woke up,

2058
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:21,790
and I realized,

2059
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:26,360
I love this woman.

2060
01:31:27,090 --> 01:31:32,220
Just hit me. I just love her.

2061
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:40,400
So, I guess
what I've learned is,

2062
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:46,160
liking someone is just as
important as loving them.

2063
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:46,170
And if you like somebody
long enough,
liking someone is just as
important as loving them.

2064
01:31:46,170 --> 01:31:51,090
And if you like somebody
long enough,

2065
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:51,100
and enough enough,
And if you like somebody
long enough,

2066
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:53,750
and enough enough,

2067
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:53,760
you learn what love is, too.
and enough enough,

2068
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,890
you learn what love is, too.

2069
01:32:01,270 --> 01:32:04,560
So... That's it.

2070
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:07,120
What do you think?

2071
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:11,670
I... I think
I'm gonna throw up.

2072
01:32:12,590 --> 01:32:16,810
Really? Let me tell you about
this other girl in Detroit.

2073

01:38:11,350 --> 01:38:13,640

2206
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:05,290

Get up. Hurry up.

2208
01:39:13,790 --> 01:39:16,260
Hey, Paul, what's going on?

You'll see.

Toro, hup! No, no, down!
Hup! Hup! Hup!

2225
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:26,710

Don't forget this.
Don't ever forget this.

2229
01:40:50,810 --> 01:40:53,980
Hey, Brian?

2230
01:40:57,490 --> 01:41:00,120
I was just downstairs,

2231
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:03,740
thinkin' about some things.

2232
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:07,990
I thought
I'd come up here and...

2233
01:41:08,690 --> 01:41:11,730
Have a talk with you,
man-to-man.

2234
01:41:15,380 --> 01:41:17,130
Listen.

2235
01:41:17,130 --> 01:41:17,140
This whole, uh, dying thing,
Listen.

2236
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:20,880
This whole, uh, dying thing,

2237
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:23,480
not my idea.

2238
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:28,020
Sometimes, stuff just happens.

2239
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:34,060
You know, my brother was right.

2240
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:34,070
I could've turned out
just like my father.
You know, my brother was right.

2241
01:41:34,070 --> 01:41:38,580
I could've turned out
just like my father.

2242
01:41:40,550 --> 01:41:43,050
He was really a good guy,

2243
01:41:43,050 --> 01:41:43,060
but he worked all the time,
and he wasn't around too much.
He was really a good guy,

but he worked all the time,
and he wasn't around too much.

2245
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:56,530
You would've spent
your whole life being angry.

2246
01:41:57,480 --> 01:42:00,010
You don't wanna do that.

2247
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:05,260
You'd have never
known me, Brian.

2248
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:11,310
I don't want you
to feel bad about me dying.

2249
01:42:13,770 --> 01:42:18,030
Dying's a really hard way
to learn about life.

2250
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:21,170
That's what happened.

2251
01:42:26,790 --> 01:42:30,980
Boy, I'm so grateful

2252
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:30,990

I've had with you.
Boy, I'm so grateful

I've had with you.

2254
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:41,550
'Cause it's absolutely the
happiest I've ever, ever been.

2255
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:51,210
Nice to meet you, Brian.

2256
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:26,180
Good.

2257
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,540
One more? No, no more.

2258
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:33,150
No? Definitely not? Definitely.

2259
01:43:34,430 --> 01:43:36,640
Okay.

2260
01:43:44,700 --> 01:43:47,100
It's happening so fast.

01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:47,110
It's a blessing.
It's happening so fast.

2262
01:43:47,110 --> 01:43:48,350
It's a blessing.

2263
01:43:48,350 --> 01:43:48,360
Believe me, I've been around.
Now, let me take this.
It's a blessing.

2264
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:52,800
Believe me, I've been around.
Now, let me take this.

2265

I love you, Dad.

2266

I love you, too.

2267
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:16,930
No.

2268
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:21,950
It's okay.

2269
01:45:22,010 --> 01:45:26,230
It's okay.
You don't have to talk.

2270
01:45:27,730 --> 01:45:30,300
I know.

2271
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:33,470
I know what's in your heart.

2272
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:37,940
It's okay.

2273
01:45:38,170 --> 01:45:40,030
Shh. No.

2274
01:45:51,990 --> 01:45:55,320
I love you.

2275
01:45:55,530 --> 01:45:58,680
You're the love of my life.
