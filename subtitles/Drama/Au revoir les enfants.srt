1
00:00:41,203 --> 00:00:45,105
Julien, don't start this again.
Be reasonable.

2
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:49,471
It's naughty to cry.
You promised.

3
00:00:49,778 --> 00:00:52,144
I'm not crying.
Really.

4
00:00:52,815 --> 00:00:56,307
I'll see you in three weeks,
and you'll be home for mardi gras.

5
00:00:56,518 --> 00:00:58,645
Time will fly.

6
00:00:58,854 --> 00:01:01,982
Why do you say that?
You know it won't.

7
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:04,284
Dad and I will write often.

8
00:01:04,793 --> 00:01:08,024
I don't give a damn about Dad,
and I hate you.

9
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:11,225
<i>Hi, Julien.</i>

10
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:14,298
Hello, children.

11
00:01:14,503 --> 00:01:16,903
You want to be with your friends.

12
00:01:17,106 --> 00:01:20,940
Yeah, right.
I can't stand that idiot.

13
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:28,115
Still smooching?

14
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:31,218
A bright boy like you
mustn't miss the train.

15
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,412
- François, I forbid you to smoke.
- It's only corn silk.

16
00:01:34,623 --> 00:01:36,420
- So?
- It doesn't count.

17
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,650
Bye, Mom.

18
00:01:39,862 --> 00:01:41,386
Be good.

19
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,493
All aboard!

20
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:45,493
Go on now.

21
00:01:58,747 --> 00:02:01,739
You think I like this?

22
00:02:02,184 --> 00:02:04,311
I miss you every moment.

23
00:02:05,354 --> 00:02:07,982
I'd like to dress up
as a boy and join you.

24
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,751
I'd see you at school every day.
It'd be our secret.

25
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:16,091
You know I can't keep you
in Paris with me.

26
00:02:44,493 --> 00:02:49,829
Written and Directed by
LOUIS MALLE

27
00:04:22,558 --> 00:04:25,152
- Did you have a good vacation, Julien?
- Yes, Father.

28
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,328
- Your parents are well?
- Yes, Father.

29
00:04:29,665 --> 00:04:32,031
- What'd you get for Christmas?
- Books.

30
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:35,135
Just books?
That's lousy.

31
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:45,611
ST. JOHN OF THE CROSS
CARMELITE CONVENT

32
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:07,898
Have you ever read Verne?

33
00:05:08,103 --> 00:05:10,128
<i>Just 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.</i>

34
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,239
Laviron, did you put
your things away?

35
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:28,480
Ach! Black market, Mr. Quentin.
I arrest you.

36
00:05:29,524 --> 00:05:31,492
<i>Your jam ist konfizkated!</i>

37
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:33,552
Let me go!

38
00:05:33,762 --> 00:05:35,627
Quentin, stop it.

39
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:40,101
Next time I'll smash your face in.
I swiped it from my brother.

40
00:05:40,302 --> 00:05:42,031
She's a real dish.

41
00:05:46,441 --> 00:05:48,500
She's got no tits.

42
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:51,472
Look out! Monkeys!

43
00:06:07,362 --> 00:06:09,660
Good evening, Father.

44
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:14,299
- Is this bed free?
- Yes. D'Eparville has whooping cough.

45
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,760
Take this one.

46
00:06:19,207 --> 00:06:22,267
Children, this is Jean Bonnet,
your new schoolmate.

47
00:06:22,878 --> 00:06:25,312
Mr. Moreau, find him a locker.

48
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:30,218
- Good night, children.
- Good night, Father.

49
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:37,417
- Hey, Bonnet!
- Where's your Easter bonnet?

50
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:40,390
That's enough!
Leave him alone!

51
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:42,927
I'll show you your locker.

52
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,928
Take this one.
Go get your things.

53
00:06:52,674 --> 00:06:54,505
What's your name?

54
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,776
<i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.</i>

55
00:07:03,585 --> 00:07:06,952
Shut up and get to bed.
It's just a blackout.

56
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:12,389
My name's Julien Quentin.
Mess with me and you'll be sorry.

57
00:07:14,296 --> 00:07:16,924
Babinot, vacation's over.

58
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:22,361
Good night, everyone.

59
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:55,827
Cut it out!

60
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,038
Hey, that's my place.

61
00:08:03,912 --> 00:08:06,107
- What's today?
- French lit and religion.

62
00:08:11,086 --> 00:08:15,318
- No hot water?
- No. We're not sissies here.

63
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:36,005
"Verily I say unto you,

64
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:39,736
unless you eat the flesh
of the Son of Man and drink his blood,

65
00:08:40,148 --> 00:08:42,742
<i>you have no life in you."</i>

66
00:08:46,154 --> 00:08:47,712
Father, give me a hand.

67
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:52,927
"Whoever eats my flesh
and drinks my blood has eternal life.

68
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:55,228
For my flesh is food indeed,

69
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,222
<i>and my blood is drink indeed."</i>

70
00:08:57,432 --> 00:09:01,027
We starve and freeze,
yet we fast for communion.

71
00:09:01,236 --> 00:09:02,396
What a place.

72
00:09:02,604 --> 00:09:05,664
- You're taking communion?
- I'm no ass-kisser like you.

73
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:10,677
"Star of the sea,
here lies the heavy sheet

74
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,744
The deep swell,
the ocean of wheat

75
00:09:12,948 --> 00:09:14,779
The turbulent spume
and our full granaries

76
00:09:14,983 --> 00:09:17,213
Here, your eyes
on this immense cope

77
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:19,353
Here your voice
on this weighty plain

78
00:09:19,554 --> 00:09:21,784
Our absent friends,
depopulated hearts

79
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,550
Here, the stretch
of our shattered fists

80
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,158
<i>Our weariness and our full force - "</i>

81
00:09:26,361 --> 00:09:29,194
Quentin, you're ready
for the Comédie-Française.

82
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:32,662
Can you tell us
who Charles Peguy was?

83
00:09:32,868 --> 00:09:35,268
He was killed
in the First World War.

84
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,370
You're starting at the end
of the story.

85
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:39,164
His mother mended chairs.

86
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:43,776
Stop laughing like idiots.
Peguy's mother was a good woman.

87
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,811
What about you, Bonnot?
You know anything about Peguy?

88
00:09:49,117 --> 00:09:51,017
No, sir.
And my name's Bonnet.

89
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:53,653
As in Easter bonnet!

90
00:09:53,855 --> 00:09:55,880
Very funny, Babinot.

91
00:09:56,691 --> 00:09:58,352
To get back in the swing
after vacation,

92
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,427
write an essay
on the first two verses.

93
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,461
You have half an hour.

94
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:40,230
I'd like to confess.

95
00:10:55,984 --> 00:10:58,544
- Are you nuts?
- It doesn't even hurt.

96
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:26,839
Quentin, take it easy!

97
00:11:27,349 --> 00:11:28,976
Careful, children.

98
00:11:33,288 --> 00:11:34,880
Take that, Negus.

99
00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:41,821
This'll warm him up.

100
00:11:55,076 --> 00:11:58,204
I'm Bayard, the fearless knight.

101
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,043
Love live France!

102
00:12:03,451 --> 00:12:05,612
Playing rough, Quentin?

103
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:11,686
Bastard!

104
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,425
En garde, Laviron!

105
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:15,528
Coward, traitor, villain!

106
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,599
I'm Negus, the Black Knight,
protector of widows and orphans.

107
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:24,334
Get back, Moor!
I'm Richard the Lionhearted.

108
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:28,270
I'll drive you from Jerusalem,
infidel Saracen.

109
00:12:29,077 --> 00:12:30,044
Son of a bitch.

110
00:12:30,245 --> 00:12:32,577
Allah is God
and Mohammed is his prophet.

111
00:12:32,781 --> 00:12:34,510
Tremble, my friend.

112
00:12:34,883 --> 00:12:39,911
Lion heart, flea brain,
pig face, cow turd.

113
00:12:51,132 --> 00:12:52,861
Go, Negus.

114
00:12:53,768 --> 00:12:55,531
Is that his real name?

115
00:12:56,104 --> 00:12:57,731
What do you think?

116
00:12:58,573 --> 00:13:00,837
He looks nasty.
You know him?

117
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:03,806
That's Lafarge, my best friend.

118
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,008
Death to the Saracens!

119
00:13:10,985 --> 00:13:12,418
Well done!

120
00:13:16,624 --> 00:13:19,684
Playtime's over.
Back to class.

121
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:24,124
Babinot, hurry up.

122
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:38,041
It doesn't even hurt.
Hold still while I put on a bandage.

123
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,505
You boys will kill yourselves
on those stilts.

124
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,813
Someone'll break a leg one day.

125
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:49,684
Hey, we said 45.

126
00:13:52,227 --> 00:13:53,956
The richer they are,
the more they steal.

127
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:58,064
Joseph, what are you up to?
Back to your potatoes.

128
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:02,198
There, all better.

129
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,441
You drink too much, Mrs. Perrin.

130
00:14:10,645 --> 00:14:13,842
Quiet, brat! Nothing wrong
with a drop of the good stuff.

131
00:14:24,993 --> 00:14:27,985
- Got any stamps?
- I'm not trading with you guys anymore.

132
00:14:28,196 --> 00:14:29,823
I've got some jam.

133
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,861
After lunch.

134
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:36,832
The doctor's wife loves your jam.

135
00:14:37,038 --> 00:14:39,939
It puts her in the mood.
Know what I mean?

136
00:14:54,923 --> 00:14:56,891
Pass the basket.

137
00:15:03,431 --> 00:15:06,764
Now there's straw in the bread!
I'm gonna write to my dad.

138
00:15:06,968 --> 00:15:09,801
- What can he do?
- Complain.

139
00:15:12,173 --> 00:15:14,641
I remind those
who've received food from home

140
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:16,935
to share with their fellow students.

141
00:15:19,347 --> 00:15:21,440
You want some salami?

142
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:23,344
I'm warning you - it's horsemeat.

143
00:15:25,253 --> 00:15:27,517
I have to eat. I'm anemic.

144
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:30,714
What about us?
Didn't you hear Father Jean?

145
00:15:32,794 --> 00:15:35,490
There's not enough for everyone.
Let your folks feed you.

146
00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:39,231
There's one piece left.

147
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:41,959
- You take it.
- Thanks. You're a pal.

148
00:15:55,717 --> 00:15:58,015
Today, St. Simeon Stylites.

149
00:15:58,219 --> 00:16:01,620
"St. Simeon was 13
and tending his father's sheep

150
00:16:01,823 --> 00:16:04,587
when he heard this verse
from the Bible:

151
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,521
'Woe unto you who laugh now,

152
00:16:06,728 --> 00:16:09,060
<i>for the day shall come
when you shall weep.'</i>

153
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:14,598
He left home to become a hermit
and lived 30 years atop a column.

154
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:19,972
He stood upright, without shelter,

155
00:16:20,174 --> 00:16:22,734
absorbed in almost
continuous prayer.

156
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,409
Vitamin crackers.

157
00:16:48,636 --> 00:16:50,604
Here. It'll taste better now.

158
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:57,371
- I've got two.
- Thanks. I'm not hungry anymore.

159
00:16:58,446 --> 00:17:00,414
That guy gets on my nerves.

160
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:04,144
- There's little Joseph now.
- You got the jam?

161
00:17:06,854 --> 00:17:09,687
Stop it!
These are my clean pants!

162
00:17:14,128 --> 00:17:16,187
Joseph's in love, boys.

163
00:17:17,965 --> 00:17:20,058
Your girlfriend looks like a slut.

164
00:17:20,268 --> 00:17:21,895
How about your sister?

165
00:17:22,103 --> 00:17:24,594
What's she look like?

166
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:30,944
- Is the teacher tough?
- No, he's nice.

167
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:34,637
- Have you had him?
- Yes. He was amazed at my Latin.

168
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:50,027
- They'll be ready to eat in three months.
- Sure, for Parents' Day.

169
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:52,756
<i>So parents will say,
"You eat so well here!"</i>

170
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:56,135
Let's see the stamps.

171
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:05,201
A 15-centime Madagascar.
The guy said it's real rare.

172
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,070
Somewhat rare.

173
00:18:08,182 --> 00:18:12,084
I think I'll keep my jam.
The grub here is lousy.

174
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:14,787
You're a real Jew.

175
00:18:22,397 --> 00:18:24,365
So, you're in love?

176
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,693
Don't joke around. It's serious.
Could you spare 50 francs?

177
00:18:28,903 --> 00:18:31,337
Women cost a bundle.
You'll find out.

178
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:34,599
No, I won't.
Besides, you're rich.

179
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:38,802
On what they pay me here?
If I could find another job -

180
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:41,379
I'm broke. Ask François.

181
00:18:43,284 --> 00:18:47,084
Ciron, put some wood in the stove.
It's freezing in here.

182
00:18:48,556 --> 00:18:51,616
No need to play the fool.

183
00:18:53,428 --> 00:18:57,831
Who can prove that the sum
of the two opposite sides AB plus CD

184
00:18:58,032 --> 00:19:00,865
equals the sum
of the other two sides?

185
00:19:02,336 --> 00:19:03,633
The new boy.

186
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:06,773
- His name's Easter Bonnet, sir.
- Knock it off.

187
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,143
We know that tangents of a circle
from a given point are equal.

188
00:19:16,451 --> 00:19:20,217
Therefore A equals a,

189
00:19:20,688 --> 00:19:23,418
B equals b...

190
00:19:33,768 --> 00:19:35,065
You think?

191
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:38,397
Turns your brain to mush,
but he doesn't have a lot to lose.

192
00:19:46,814 --> 00:19:49,749
Right. Very good.

193
00:19:52,553 --> 00:19:54,521
- Everyone understand?
- Yes, sir.

194
00:19:57,158 --> 00:19:58,853
Great! An air raid!

195
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:02,461
We'll go down to the shelter.

196
00:20:03,831 --> 00:20:05,822
But class isn't over.
Bring your books.

197
00:20:30,258 --> 00:20:32,226
Hurry up, children.

198
00:20:32,426 --> 00:20:35,259
<i>- Mother Michel lost her cat
- Quiet!</i>

199
00:20:40,868 --> 00:20:42,893
Now for some algebra.

200
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:46,302
Follow along in your books.
Page 61.

201
00:20:49,143 --> 00:20:50,906
Algebraic numbers

202
00:20:51,112 --> 00:20:55,446
are like arithmetic numbers in that...

203
00:21:00,454 --> 00:21:01,978
Give me some light?

204
00:21:02,189 --> 00:21:04,054
Get lost.

205
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:06,222
Lift up the light.
I can't see.

206
00:21:06,427 --> 00:21:08,019
I'll get caught!

207
00:21:08,863 --> 00:21:10,888
You're such a pain!

208
00:21:23,277 --> 00:21:25,404
They're bombing the station.

209
00:21:25,713 --> 00:21:29,080
- No, it's the barracks.
- Calm down and stay seated.

210
00:21:31,786 --> 00:21:34,414
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with you...

211
00:21:49,971 --> 00:21:51,905
The lovebirds!

212
00:21:54,609 --> 00:21:56,440
Quentin, turn that off!

213
00:22:03,117 --> 00:22:05,415
Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

214
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,349
Give us this day our daily bread,

215
00:22:07,555 --> 00:22:11,286
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive our trespassers,

216
00:22:11,492 --> 00:22:15,952
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

217
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:19,590
To bed now. Good night.

218
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,401
Just curl up
like a little doggie.

219
00:22:35,316 --> 00:22:37,216
Did you do this?

220
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:27,098
Shit!

221
00:24:29,396 --> 00:24:31,125
What is it?

222
00:24:51,652 --> 00:24:54,644
One, two...

223
00:24:55,456 --> 00:24:59,256
three, four...

224
00:25:04,665 --> 00:25:06,496
Shoulders back!

225
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:15,074
You've got biceps
like papier-mâché!

226
00:25:23,384 --> 00:25:25,614
She's showing off her ass.

227
00:25:26,287 --> 00:25:28,016
It's a lot better than yours.

228
00:25:28,222 --> 00:25:30,190
Quiet!

229
00:25:30,391 --> 00:25:32,757
Ciron, 20 extra push-ups!

230
00:25:35,095 --> 00:25:38,587
Keep going!
Get those rear ends down!

231
00:25:54,348 --> 00:25:55,975
It's an A-sharp.

232
00:25:56,183 --> 00:25:58,151
Can't you hear
when you hit a wrong note?

233
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,012
Go on.

234
00:26:07,294 --> 00:26:09,353
You should try the violin.

235
00:26:09,897 --> 00:26:11,524
Do you hate music?

236
00:26:11,732 --> 00:26:14,223
Not at all. But my mother
forces me to take piano.

237
00:26:14,435 --> 00:26:18,565
She's right. If you stop now,
you'll always regret it.

238
00:26:19,607 --> 00:26:21,074
Time's up.

239
00:26:21,642 --> 00:26:22,734
See you Tuesday.

240
00:26:23,244 --> 00:26:24,871
Good-bye, miss.

241
00:26:31,218 --> 00:26:33,743
- What's your name?
- Jean Bonnet.

242
00:26:35,723 --> 00:26:37,691
Let's hear you play.

243
00:26:39,994 --> 00:26:41,484
Try this.

244
00:27:36,383 --> 00:27:38,078
Ass-kisser.

245
00:27:58,405 --> 00:28:00,464
Bonnet, get back to your seat.

246
00:28:16,223 --> 00:28:18,748
"My darling, as you know,

247
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:21,450
it's very hard
for me to write to you.

248
00:28:21,662 --> 00:28:24,392
Mr. D. was going to Lyon,

249
00:28:25,032 --> 00:28:27,557
and he agreed to mail this.

250
00:28:27,768 --> 00:28:29,963
<i>Your aunt and I seldom go out - "</i>

251
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,694
Julien Quentin.

252
00:28:32,206 --> 00:28:34,003
Confession.

253
00:28:40,614 --> 00:28:43,014
Your mother's up to something.

254
00:28:51,492 --> 00:28:54,052
Oh, yes - I fought
with my sister on vacation.

255
00:28:54,261 --> 00:28:56,024
Nothing else?

256
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,822
I don't think so.

257
00:28:58,032 --> 00:28:59,932
No evil thoughts?

258
00:29:01,368 --> 00:29:05,134
You know what I mean.
Everyone has them.

259
00:29:05,873 --> 00:29:08,501
- Even you?
- Even me.

260
00:29:10,978 --> 00:29:13,469
- What's wrong?
- Frostbite.

261
00:29:13,747 --> 00:29:15,305
Show me.

262
00:29:19,953 --> 00:29:21,716
It's a vitamin deficiency.

263
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,520
Tell Mrs. Perrin
to give you cod-liver oil.

264
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:28,091
It's the cold.
It's freezing in school.

265
00:29:28,295 --> 00:29:29,728
I know.

266
00:29:30,164 --> 00:29:32,598
But think of those
less fortunate than you.

267
00:29:35,536 --> 00:29:38,403
You told your mother
you wanted to take holy orders.

268
00:29:38,772 --> 00:29:40,330
She told you?

269
00:29:40,908 --> 00:29:44,002
I don't think you have
any calling for the priesthood.

270
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,670
It's a sorry job anyway.

271
00:29:55,889 --> 00:29:58,153
Say three Hail Marys.

272
00:29:58,525 --> 00:30:00,322
You may stand up.

273
00:30:08,502 --> 00:30:10,493
Who told you that?

274
00:30:11,338 --> 00:30:13,363
You mustn't believe rumors.

275
00:30:17,144 --> 00:30:18,805
What can I do?

276
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:24,347
We're in the Lord's hands.

277
00:30:34,695 --> 00:30:36,925
Do you get along well
with your new classmate?

278
00:30:37,131 --> 00:30:38,359
Bonnet?

279
00:30:38,565 --> 00:30:40,556
Be very nice to him.

280
00:30:40,968 --> 00:30:43,903
The others look up to you.
I'm counting on you.

281
00:30:44,705 --> 00:30:46,263
Why? Is he sick?

282
00:30:46,473 --> 00:30:49,806
Not at all.
Run along now.

283
00:31:15,636 --> 00:31:17,900
- Pétain's a loony.
- He is not.

284
00:31:18,105 --> 00:31:19,936
If we didn't have Pétain,
we'd be in deep shit.

285
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,801
- Says who?
- My father.

286
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:23,738
My father says Laval
sold out to the Germans.

287
00:31:23,944 --> 00:31:25,707
Jews and Communists
are worse than Germans.

288
00:31:25,913 --> 00:31:28,143
- Your Dad says that?
- No, I do.

289
00:31:28,348 --> 00:31:30,009
I'm not surprised.

290
00:31:38,158 --> 00:31:40,592
Don't dawdle.
Stay together.

291
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,428
- Good, isn't it?
- What?

292
00:31:46,033 --> 00:31:47,728
<i>The Three Musketeers.
How far are you?</i>

293
00:31:47,935 --> 00:31:50,995
- Milady's trial.
- She's a real bitch.

294
00:31:53,006 --> 00:31:56,533
- What are you gonna do later?
- I don't know. Math.

295
00:31:56,743 --> 00:31:59,974
Math's a bunch of shit,
unless you want to be an accountant.

296
00:32:00,347 --> 00:32:02,281
My father was an accountant.

297
00:32:08,222 --> 00:32:10,349
PUBLIC BATHS
Hurry up, children.

298
00:32:10,557 --> 00:32:12,582
Quentin, come along.

299
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,954
Come on, Babinot.

300
00:32:23,704 --> 00:32:25,604
NO JEWS ALLOWED

301
00:33:13,153 --> 00:33:15,280
Remember,
we don't have much time.

302
00:33:15,489 --> 00:33:17,116
You haven't bathed in two weeks.

303
00:33:18,258 --> 00:33:20,920
Bonnet, is it true
you're not gonna be confirmed?

304
00:33:21,128 --> 00:33:22,618
I'm a Protestant.

305
00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:25,627
A heretic - disgusting!

306
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:33,131
Bonnet isn't a Protestant name.

307
00:33:33,507 --> 00:33:35,134
It sure is.

308
00:33:38,045 --> 00:33:40,605
- Second shower.
- Not a tub?

309
00:33:40,814 --> 00:33:42,441
A shower. Now go!

310
00:33:42,649 --> 00:33:46,676
Babinot, what are you doing?
That's enough now.

311
00:33:49,623 --> 00:33:52,251
Bonnet, take the tub at the end.

312
00:33:52,793 --> 00:33:54,522
- Can I have a tub too?
- In there.

313
00:33:54,728 --> 00:33:56,753
- What about me?
- In there.

314
00:33:58,065 --> 00:34:01,228
- It's tiny. My feet'll stick out.
- It'll have to do.

315
00:34:26,259 --> 00:34:28,318
<i>You should try the violin.</i>

316
00:34:37,337 --> 00:34:39,532
<i>Quentin, what are you doing?</i>

317
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,101
<i>I'm waiting for your tub.</i>

318
00:34:58,825 --> 00:35:01,123
Smart-aleck.
I told you to hurry up.

319
00:35:05,832 --> 00:35:07,891
I can't help it.

320
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:10,001
My soap won't lather.

321
00:35:17,144 --> 00:35:19,135
Hurry up. It's freezing.

322
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:26,319
- That guy's got some nerve!
- Shut up.

323
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,648
It's cold. We'll run back.
Let's go!

324
00:36:40,393 --> 00:36:43,658
Pull your arms back.

325
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,565
Squat, one and two.

326
00:36:51,171 --> 00:36:52,968
Again.

327
00:37:05,785 --> 00:37:07,650
Looks like the mountain troops.

328
00:37:07,854 --> 00:37:09,879
No, they're militia.

329
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:12,786
This is a search.

330
00:37:13,126 --> 00:37:15,185
You have no right to enter here.

331
00:37:15,529 --> 00:37:17,360
This is a private school.

332
00:37:17,564 --> 00:37:20,032
Only children and men of the cloth.

333
00:37:23,169 --> 00:37:24,659
What do those collaborators want?

334
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:26,896
- We have orders.
- From whom?

335
00:37:27,107 --> 00:37:28,369
Our superiors.

336
00:37:28,575 --> 00:37:30,372
- I'll complain.
- To whom?

337
00:37:31,511 --> 00:37:34,947
- You can go in now.
- Already? Great!

338
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:50,523
<i>Hey!</i>

339
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,893
<i>Your jam was a big hit.
Got any more?</i>

340
00:37:54,534 --> 00:37:56,764
What did the militia want?

341
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:59,837
They're snooping around.
Heard there were draft dodgers here.

342
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,268
Draft dodgers?

343
00:38:01,474 --> 00:38:04,932
Guys hiding out
to avoid forced labor in Germany.

344
00:38:05,145 --> 00:38:07,511
Like Moreau, the monitor.
- Really?

345
00:38:07,714 --> 00:38:11,172
Moreau's not his real name.
But I don't care.

346
00:38:11,718 --> 00:38:14,016
With my leg, I'll be exempt.

347
00:38:14,688 --> 00:38:17,020
- Joseph!
- Coming.

348
00:38:17,591 --> 00:38:19,684
She's worse than going to Germany.

349
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:29,696
<i>Rollin. average. Nine and a half.</i>

350
00:38:29,903 --> 00:38:31,803
Bonnet? Not here.

351
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:33,870
Good riddance.

352
00:38:34,674 --> 00:38:36,039
Quentin.

353
00:38:36,242 --> 00:38:39,609
Intelligent, but a bit pretentious.

354
00:38:39,846 --> 00:38:41,404
This, for example:

355
00:38:41,615 --> 00:38:45,642
<i>"Peguy sees the cathedral
as a grand and generous beacon."</i>

356
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,721
Take your seat.

357
00:38:55,128 --> 00:38:56,720
Where were you?

358
00:39:02,102 --> 00:39:04,366
Ciron, 12 points.

359
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:07,563
Where do you get barges
in the middle of wheat fields?

360
00:39:07,774 --> 00:39:10,709
On the Foussarde Canal, sir.
I was there on vacation.

361
00:39:11,411 --> 00:39:12,537
Bonnet.

362
00:39:12,946 --> 00:39:16,677
<i>131l2. Good work.
Sensitive and well-written.</i>

363
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:20,016
Quentin, you've got competition.

364
00:39:25,592 --> 00:39:28,152
Who hasn't had
his vitamin cracker?

365
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:32,462
D'Arsonval, stop lagging.

366
00:39:32,666 --> 00:39:34,566
I can't pay you right away.

367
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:38,027
You promised.

368
00:39:40,407 --> 00:39:43,706
Ask the little shit. I'm sure
the miser's hoarding some sugar.

369
00:39:44,377 --> 00:39:46,538
Want some marbles?

370
00:39:53,253 --> 00:39:54,880
<i>Julien Quentin?</i>

371
00:39:55,722 --> 00:39:57,349
Wait!

372
00:39:57,957 --> 00:39:59,788
Julien Quentin.

373
00:40:17,477 --> 00:40:20,002
<i>The apartment seems empty
without you.</i>

374
00:40:20,213 --> 00:40:23,580
<i>Paris is no fun these days.
They bomb us nearly every night.</i>

375
00:40:23,783 --> 00:40:27,184
A bomb killed
eight people yesterday.

376
00:40:27,387 --> 00:40:28,911
<i>Charming!</i>

377
00:40:29,222 --> 00:40:30,814
<i>The girls are back in school.</i>

378
00:40:31,024 --> 00:40:33,584
<i>Sophie works at the Red Cross
Thursdays and Sundays.</i>

379
00:40:33,793 --> 00:40:35,784
<i>So many unfortunate people.</i>

380
00:40:36,062 --> 00:40:38,792
<i>Dad's at the plant in Lille.
His factory's hardly producing.</i>

381
00:40:38,998 --> 00:40:40,829
<i>He's in a foul mood.</i>

382
00:40:41,234 --> 00:40:43,634
<i>It's really time this war ended.</i>

383
00:40:44,404 --> 00:40:46,668
<i>I'll come get you Sunday at 8.00,
as we agreed.</i>

384
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,837
<i>We'll have lunch at Le Grand Cerf.</i>

385
00:40:49,175 --> 00:40:51,643
<i>Can't wait to give you a big hug.</i>

386
00:40:51,945 --> 00:40:53,503
<i>Your loving mother.</i>

387
00:40:53,747 --> 00:40:55,681
<i>P.S. Eat your jam.
I'll bring you more.</i>

388
00:40:55,882 --> 00:40:57,747
<i>Take good care of your health.</i>

389
00:41:39,025 --> 00:41:40,390
Beat it, buddy.

390
00:42:41,654 --> 00:42:44,452
"First prize in arithmetic - Jean...

391
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,631
Jean Kippel...

392
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,205
<i>Kippelstein."</i>

393
00:43:14,153 --> 00:43:15,643
I'm hungry.

394
00:43:16,723 --> 00:43:18,315
What's a perpendicular bisector?

395
00:43:18,524 --> 00:43:22,324
- A perpendicular in mid-segment.
- What's it good for?

396
00:43:45,385 --> 00:43:47,353
That's a theta, not a tau.

397
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:11,173
We'll continue next time.

398
00:44:14,747 --> 00:44:16,078
Greek is useful, you know.

399
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:18,874
All scientific words
have Greek roots.

400
00:44:56,689 --> 00:44:58,714
Who do you like best?
Athos or d'Artagnan?

401
00:44:58,925 --> 00:45:00,449
Aramis.

402
00:45:01,527 --> 00:45:02,789
He's a hypocrite.

403
00:45:02,996 --> 00:45:04,896
Yeah, but he's the smartest one.

404
00:45:07,433 --> 00:45:09,162
Why don't you take Greek?

405
00:45:09,535 --> 00:45:12,129
- I took Latin.
- Where?

406
00:45:12,805 --> 00:45:16,138
At school in Marseilles.

407
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:19,642
You're from Marseilles?
You don't have an accent.

408
00:45:21,047 --> 00:45:22,878
I wasn't born there.

409
00:45:23,483 --> 00:45:25,178
Where were you born?

410
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:29,352
You wouldn't know it
if I told you.

411
00:45:31,257 --> 00:45:34,886
Is Greek hard?
- Not once you know the alphabet.

412
00:45:35,128 --> 00:45:37,221
Are your parents in Marseilles?

413
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,528
My dad's a prisoner.

414
00:45:45,738 --> 00:45:47,399
He didn't escape?

415
00:45:48,641 --> 00:45:51,109
And where's your mother?

416
00:45:55,081 --> 00:45:56,776
You won't tell me?

417
00:45:57,183 --> 00:45:59,515
- In the unoccupied zone.
- There's no unoccupied zone anymore.

418
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:02,813
I know that. Now lay off.
I don't know where she is.

419
00:46:03,022 --> 00:46:05,718
She hasn't written in three months.
Happy now?

420
00:46:11,764 --> 00:46:13,789
What are you two up to?

421
00:46:15,068 --> 00:46:17,298
I have a cold.

422
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:21,204
Enough nonsense.
Go out and play.

423
00:46:25,278 --> 00:46:27,872
Hippo's a bastard.
Always snooping around.

424
00:46:31,584 --> 00:46:36,112
<i>St. Thomas's proofs
of God's existence don't hold water.</i>

425
00:46:36,322 --> 00:46:38,153
I don't agree.

426
00:46:38,491 --> 00:46:41,551
Since we can imagine God,
he must exist.

427
00:46:42,628 --> 00:46:43,822
That's just sophistry.

428
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:47,466
At least Bergson seeks
transcendence in science.

429
00:46:48,401 --> 00:46:50,631
Hey, I want to talk to you.

430
00:46:55,641 --> 00:46:58,735
- That's strong.
- It's the real thing, dummy.

431
00:47:01,581 --> 00:47:04,709
Let's go somewhere else.
The monkeys will catch us here.

432
00:47:08,488 --> 00:47:10,149
- Do me a favor.
- What?

433
00:47:10,356 --> 00:47:12,483
Pass a note to your piano teacher.

434
00:47:12,692 --> 00:47:15,422
- You're crazy! I'll get expelled!
- She won't say anything.

435
00:47:15,628 --> 00:47:17,220
You're such a scaredy-cat.

436
00:47:18,698 --> 00:47:20,666
François, what's a yid?

437
00:47:20,867 --> 00:47:23,995
- A Jew.
- I know, but what exactly is a Jew?

438
00:47:24,203 --> 00:47:26,899
- Someone who doesn't eat pork.
- Are you kidding me?

439
00:47:27,106 --> 00:47:28,596
Not at all.

440
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:30,672
What have people got against them?

441
00:47:30,877 --> 00:47:34,074
The fact they're smarter than us,
and they crucified Jesus.

442
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,111
That's not true.
It was the Romans.

443
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:39,347
Is that why they have
to wear yellow stars?

444
00:47:39,552 --> 00:47:41,952
- Will you take my letter to Davenne?
- No.

445
00:47:42,155 --> 00:47:44,214
What do you want with her anyway?
- Never mind.

446
00:47:44,423 --> 00:47:47,915
<i>Be nice. I'll lend you my
Arabian Nights. It'll give you a hard-on.</i>

447
00:47:48,294 --> 00:47:50,057
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

448
00:47:54,901 --> 00:47:56,528
You smell awful, Joseph.

449
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:00,238
Stop it, right now!

450
00:48:01,874 --> 00:48:03,501
He called me a creep!

451
00:48:03,709 --> 00:48:06,769
That's enough now.
Calm down and go back to the kitchen.

452
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,405
<i>"Down, Joseph!
To your kennel!"</i>

453
00:48:10,616 --> 00:48:12,345
I'm not a dog!

454
00:48:12,552 --> 00:48:14,247
Stop it, D'Arsonval!

455
00:48:25,831 --> 00:48:29,062
Damn, a cross.
Another wrong trail.

456
00:48:31,971 --> 00:48:34,701
We have to get back to the crossroads,
quickly and quietly.

457
00:48:36,108 --> 00:48:38,440
There must be another trail
at the fork.

458
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,609
I wonder where the others are.

459
00:48:43,382 --> 00:48:44,542
What's today?

460
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:47,241
January 17. Thursday.

461
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,856
You realize there'll never be
another January 17, 1944?

462
00:48:52,258 --> 00:48:54,021
Never again.

463
00:48:54,427 --> 00:48:55,894
Shut up and get a move on!

464
00:48:56,095 --> 00:48:59,155
In 40 years,
half these guys'll be dead and buried.

465
00:49:00,032 --> 00:49:01,829
Come on.

466
00:49:02,201 --> 00:49:05,898
I'm the only one in this school
who thinks about death. It's incredible!

467
00:49:11,711 --> 00:49:14,737
You're our prisoners.
Follow us.

468
00:49:14,947 --> 00:49:17,074
We're gonna tie your hands.

469
00:49:21,354 --> 00:49:23,322
There are two missing.
Over there! It's Quentin!

470
00:51:18,437 --> 00:51:19,836
Wow!

471
00:51:43,929 --> 00:51:47,387
I found the treasure.
The Greens win.

472
00:53:54,226 --> 00:53:55,693
Didn't they catch you?

473
00:53:55,895 --> 00:53:58,989
Yes, they tied me to a tree,
but I got free.

474
00:53:59,198 --> 00:54:00,665
Bastards!

475
00:54:02,568 --> 00:54:04,593
I found the treasure.
All by myself.

476
00:54:09,808 --> 00:54:11,935
Are there wolves in these woods?

477
00:54:25,157 --> 00:54:26,624
It's that way.

478
00:55:48,407 --> 00:55:49,635
We go left. I'm sure.

479
00:55:49,842 --> 00:55:52,709
- No, we go right.
- I told you, we go left.

480
00:56:47,466 --> 00:56:50,128
It's the high wall
next to the church, right?

481
00:56:50,803 --> 00:56:54,239
I know it.
We Bavarians are Catholic.

482
00:57:04,416 --> 00:57:07,647
Good evening, Father.
Lost any children?

483
00:57:07,853 --> 00:57:11,516
We looked everywhere.
Always playing the fool, Julien!

484
00:57:11,724 --> 00:57:15,319
That's not fair.
I found the treasure.

485
00:57:15,661 --> 00:57:19,119
But everyone had vanished.

486
00:57:23,902 --> 00:57:25,870
It's all right, my boy.

487
00:57:26,071 --> 00:57:27,663
What happened?

488
00:57:28,173 --> 00:57:30,164
They got arrested by the Krauts.

489
00:57:31,243 --> 00:57:32,574
Could the Krauts

490
00:57:32,778 --> 00:57:34,143
have their blanket back?

491
00:57:36,048 --> 00:57:37,606
Thank you very much.

492
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:42,349
No civilians in the woods after 8:00 p.m.
Don't you know there's a curfew?

493
00:57:42,554 --> 00:57:44,545
You think we did it on purpose?

494
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:47,349
I caught hell because of you.

495
00:57:47,559 --> 00:57:48,958
You won because of me, jerk.

496
00:57:49,161 --> 00:57:50,890
Come on. Hurry up.

497
00:58:06,712 --> 00:58:08,202
Calm down.

498
00:58:08,413 --> 00:58:09,846
Lafarge, out!

499
00:58:16,655 --> 00:58:18,247
Feeling better, twerp?

500
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:20,854
A present from Joseph.

501
00:58:21,493 --> 00:58:23,222
And a letter from your mom.

502
00:58:23,428 --> 00:58:24,918
She's your mom too.

503
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:26,825
But you're her pet.

504
00:58:27,099 --> 00:58:29,260
Dad's always off in Lille.
I bet she's getting plenty.

505
00:58:29,468 --> 00:58:32,665
- What do you mean?
- Women are all whores, my friend.

506
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:34,302
Sorry, Sister.

507
00:58:34,506 --> 00:58:35,837
What an idiot!

508
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:38,168
- Swabbing time.
- Again?

509
00:58:38,377 --> 00:58:40,937
Three times a day.
Sit up straight.

510
00:58:42,481 --> 00:58:44,142
Open your mouth.

511
00:58:44,516 --> 00:58:47,883
Open wide.
Keep your tongue down.

512
00:58:56,995 --> 00:58:59,828
Listen here!
Open your mouth!

513
00:59:12,578 --> 00:59:15,604
- Were you scared last night?
- Not really.

514
00:59:15,814 --> 00:59:17,805
I hear you saw some wild boar.

515
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:20,314
Were there lots?
- Around 50.

516
00:59:21,353 --> 00:59:23,321
What about the Germans?

517
00:59:23,622 --> 00:59:25,613
Did they really fire at you?

518
00:59:26,024 --> 00:59:28,151
- Just a few bursts.
- Come on!

519
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:31,552
Nice book.

520
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:34,197
What is it?

521
00:59:34,399 --> 00:59:36,697
<i>The Arabian Nights.
It's my brother's.</i>

522
00:59:36,902 --> 00:59:38,893
It's banned by the monkeys.
- Why?

523
00:59:39,104 --> 00:59:41,971
It's really dirty.
I'll lend it to you.

524
00:59:42,174 --> 00:59:44,005
Recess is over.

525
00:59:47,246 --> 00:59:49,373
We've got our religion class.

526
00:59:49,581 --> 00:59:51,139
See you tomorrow.

527
00:59:53,185 --> 00:59:55,619
- Kiss Mother Michel for me.
- Oh, we will.

528
00:59:58,891 --> 01:00:00,654
<i>The Arabian Nights.</i>

529
01:00:26,752 --> 01:00:28,276
You're disgusting.

530
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,415
It doesn't hurt it.

531
01:00:31,189 --> 01:00:32,816
It's dead.

532
01:00:36,461 --> 01:00:38,622
A present from Joseph.

533
01:00:40,832 --> 01:00:42,663
No, thanks.
I don't like pâté.

534
01:00:42,868 --> 01:00:44,301
Go on. Eat it.

535
01:00:44,503 --> 01:00:46,630
I said no.
I don't like pâté.

536
01:00:48,774 --> 01:00:50,742
Because it's pork?

537
01:00:51,677 --> 01:00:54,077
Why do you always ask
such stupid questions?

538
01:00:55,247 --> 01:00:58,239
Because your name's Kippelstein,
not Bonnet.

539
01:00:59,451 --> 01:01:02,682
<i>Do you say "Kippelstine"
or "Kippelsteen"?</i>

540
01:01:10,696 --> 01:01:13,529
Bonnet, get back in bed
this minute or I'll report you!

541
01:01:16,501 --> 01:01:18,264
And you quiet down.

542
01:01:33,218 --> 01:01:35,778
- Are your parents coming?
- The whole family.

543
01:01:46,098 --> 01:01:48,726
Aren't you dressing up?
No visitors?

544
01:01:49,134 --> 01:01:51,364
What the hell is it to you?

545
01:02:09,321 --> 01:02:13,257
My message today is especially
for the youngest among you

546
01:02:13,458 --> 01:02:16,484
who will be confirmed
in a few weeks.

547
01:02:16,895 --> 01:02:18,021
My children,

548
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:20,357
we live in a time
of discord and hatred.

549
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:23,998
Lies are all-powerful.
Christians kill one another.

550
01:02:24,302 --> 01:02:26,827
Those who should guide us
betray us instead.

551
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:31,403
More than ever, we must beware
of selfishness and indifference.

552
01:02:32,444 --> 01:02:36,210
You're all from wealthy families,
some very wealthy.

553
01:02:36,915 --> 01:02:40,851
Because you've been given much,
much will be asked of you.

554
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:44,082
Remember the Bible's stern lesson:

555
01:02:44,322 --> 01:02:47,780
"It's easier for a camel
to pass through the eye of a needle

556
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:51,496
<i>than for a rich man
to enter the kingdom of heaven."</i>

557
01:02:51,696 --> 01:02:52,993
St. James said,

558
01:02:53,198 --> 01:02:58,397
<i>"Now, you rich, weep and wail
for the woes awaiting you."</i>

559
01:02:58,603 --> 01:03:02,664
<i>Your wealth has rotted,
and your garments are eaten by worms."</i>

560
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:07,141
Worldly wealth corrupts souls
and withers hearts.

561
01:03:07,345 --> 01:03:10,906
It makes men contemptuous, unjust,

562
01:03:11,116 --> 01:03:13,414
pitiless in their egoism.

563
01:03:13,652 --> 01:03:16,587
I understand the anger
of those who have nothing

564
01:03:16,788 --> 01:03:20,121
when the rich feast so arrogantly.

565
01:03:29,568 --> 01:03:31,365
He's hitting pretty hard.

566
01:03:33,672 --> 01:03:34,866
I don't mean to shock you

567
01:03:35,073 --> 01:03:39,601
but only remind you
that charity is a Christian's first duty.

568
01:03:40,178 --> 01:03:43,204
St. Paul tells us in today's Epistle,

569
01:03:43,415 --> 01:03:47,044
"Brothers, be not wise
in your own conceits.

570
01:03:47,252 --> 01:03:49,243
Do not repay any man
evil for evil.

571
01:03:49,688 --> 01:03:52,316
If thine enemy hunger, feed him.

572
01:03:52,524 --> 01:03:54,788
<i>If he thirst, give him drink."</i>

573
01:03:56,328 --> 01:04:00,594
Let us pray for the hungry,
for those who suffer,

574
01:04:00,932 --> 01:04:02,957
for the persecuted.

575
01:04:03,668 --> 01:04:05,761
Let us pray for the victims

576
01:04:06,138 --> 01:04:08,333
and for their executioners as well.

577
01:05:17,943 --> 01:05:20,878
<i>- Will you give concerts?
- Not right away.</i>

578
01:05:21,079 --> 01:05:22,876
I still need practice.

579
01:05:23,315 --> 01:05:25,875
It's hard to get started.

580
01:05:27,786 --> 01:05:29,048
It's Duvallier's dog.

581
01:05:29,254 --> 01:05:31,882
- It'll bite you.
- He doesn't bite.

582
01:05:36,561 --> 01:05:38,461
En garde, Easter Bonnet.

583
01:05:40,031 --> 01:05:42,591
Help me, you guys!
Get the heretic!

584
01:05:45,804 --> 01:05:47,829
You're really getting on my nerves.

585
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:50,365
Go, Julien!

586
01:05:56,982 --> 01:05:59,382
Julien, have you gone mad!

587
01:06:01,419 --> 01:06:03,319
Your best suit.

588
01:06:04,055 --> 01:06:06,455
What'll they say at the restaurant?

589
01:06:09,227 --> 01:06:12,094
What's gotten into you boys?
You think it's funny?

590
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:27,601
Was everything all right, Mr. Meyer?

591
01:06:27,812 --> 01:06:30,872
Thank you.
The rabbit was tolerable.

592
01:06:31,716 --> 01:06:34,241
Mrs. Quentin,
your table's this way.

593
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:38,587
François, sit over there.
Julien here.

594
01:06:42,727 --> 01:06:45,787
- We haven't seen you lately.
- Vacations.

595
01:06:49,834 --> 01:06:51,131
What fish do you have?

596
01:06:51,336 --> 01:06:54,328
We haven't had fish in ages, ma'am.

597
01:06:54,539 --> 01:06:59,306
I recommend the rabbit.
Half a meal coupon per serving.

598
01:06:59,511 --> 01:07:01,502
Is it rabbit or cat?

599
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,178
Rabbit, sir.
With sauteed potatoes.

600
01:07:04,382 --> 01:07:07,874
- In butter?
- Margarine.

601
01:07:08,353 --> 01:07:09,820
No coupons required.

602
01:07:10,021 --> 01:07:14,617
Very well. We'll have the rabbit,
and a bottle of Bordeaux.

603
01:07:23,268 --> 01:07:24,496
The place is full of Krauts.

604
01:07:24,703 --> 01:07:27,297
I thought they were all
on the Russian front.

605
01:07:27,639 --> 01:07:29,539
You caught their eye.

606
01:07:33,745 --> 01:07:35,906
Your parents couldn't come?

607
01:07:36,981 --> 01:07:38,278
Poor boy.

608
01:07:38,583 --> 01:07:39,880
What about Dad?

609
01:07:40,085 --> 01:07:43,111
He said he was coming.
- He couldn't. Problems at the plant.

610
01:07:43,321 --> 01:07:44,583
As usual.

611
01:07:44,789 --> 01:07:47,849
Your poor father
is under a lot of pressure.

612
01:07:48,193 --> 01:07:51,651
- Is he still for Pétain?
- No one is anymore.

613
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:56,399
I heard of your ordeal in the woods.
I gave Father Jean a piece of my mind.

614
01:07:56,835 --> 01:07:59,303
Those boy scout games are ludicrous
in this freezing cold.

615
01:07:59,504 --> 01:08:01,404
You could've died, my darling.

616
01:08:01,906 --> 01:08:04,898
Guns do go off!
- Makes a man of him.

617
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:08,876
That's just what Father Jean said.

618
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,206
I mean really!

619
01:08:10,415 --> 01:08:13,213
- He was with me in the woods.
- Oh, so it was you.

620
01:08:14,486 --> 01:08:16,681
I bet you're from Lyon.

621
01:08:16,888 --> 01:08:19,118
The name Gillet is from Lyon.
They're all in the silk trade.

622
01:08:19,591 --> 01:08:21,718
His name's Bonnet, not Gillet.

623
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:23,459
Of course.

624
01:08:23,661 --> 01:08:25,026
He's from Marseilles.

625
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:29,394
I knew a Bonnet there, a cousin
of the Du Perrons. Is she your mother?

626
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:33,762
How strange.

627
01:08:34,773 --> 01:08:36,502
His father's an accountant.

628
01:08:36,841 --> 01:08:38,172
Really.

629
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:53,821
Your papers, please.

630
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:02,332
Your papers, sir.

631
01:09:19,918 --> 01:09:22,648
Can't you read?

632
01:09:22,854 --> 01:09:24,651
This place is off limits to yids.

633
01:09:31,463 --> 01:09:33,454
Why are those men bothering people?

634
01:09:33,898 --> 01:09:35,957
That gentleman looks very proper.

635
01:09:37,535 --> 01:09:39,196
Mr. Meyer's been coming here
for 20 years.

636
01:09:39,704 --> 01:09:42,673
I can't just throw him out.
- Shut up, flunky!

637
01:09:43,541 --> 01:09:45,907
I can have your license revoked.

638
01:09:46,744 --> 01:09:47,768
Collaborators.

639
01:09:47,979 --> 01:09:49,469
Quiet, François.

640
01:09:50,648 --> 01:09:52,309
Did you say that?

641
01:09:52,584 --> 01:09:54,814
He's a child.
He doesn't know what he's saying.

642
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:58,951
We serve France, lady.
He insulted us.

643
01:09:59,891 --> 01:10:01,984
Go away!

644
01:10:03,962 --> 01:10:07,159
It's monstrous.
You should be ashamed.

645
01:10:07,632 --> 01:10:09,031
Not at all.

646
01:10:13,538 --> 01:10:15,005
Leave him alone.

647
01:10:15,206 --> 01:10:17,800
He's right.
Send the Jews to Moscow!

648
01:10:24,015 --> 01:10:25,778
Get the hell out of here!

649
01:10:28,653 --> 01:10:31,178
You understand?
Get the hell out!

650
01:10:43,334 --> 01:10:44,892
We'll meet again.

651
01:10:48,406 --> 01:10:50,931
Say what you will,
but some of them are decent.

652
01:10:51,242 --> 01:10:53,267
He was showing off for you.

653
01:11:04,322 --> 01:11:05,789
Aren't we Jewish?

654
01:11:06,291 --> 01:11:09,454
- That's all we need!
- Isn't Aunt Reinach Jewish?

655
01:11:09,861 --> 01:11:12,694
- She's Alsatian.
- You can be Alsatian and Jewish.

656
01:11:13,064 --> 01:11:15,897
That's quite enough!
The Reinachs are devout Catholics!

657
01:11:16,634 --> 01:11:18,397
If they heard you!

658
01:11:18,736 --> 01:11:21,728
Mind you,
I have nothing against Jews.

659
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:25,567
Except for that Léon Blum.
They can hang him.

660
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:31,371
Julien, sit up straight.

661
01:11:34,285 --> 01:11:36,617
Your friend is nice.
He doesn't say much.

662
01:11:36,854 --> 01:11:38,287
He has his reasons.

663
01:11:38,523 --> 01:11:41,515
- Then he's no dummy.
- Not at all.

664
01:11:43,695 --> 01:11:46,186
Where's François?
What's he up to?

665
01:11:46,397 --> 01:11:49,525
He always gives the Krauts
wrong directions.

666
01:11:49,801 --> 01:11:51,359
Very clever!

667
01:11:55,506 --> 01:11:58,964
- What if I joined the resistance?
- Nonsense. You must finish school.

668
01:11:59,177 --> 01:12:01,839
Some things are
more important than school.

669
01:12:02,413 --> 01:12:03,880
Julien wants to become a monkey.

670
01:12:04,082 --> 01:12:06,482
Not a monkey.
A missionary in the Congo.

671
01:12:06,684 --> 01:12:10,051
Stop using that stupid word.
It's awful.

672
01:12:10,421 --> 01:12:12,685
You should be grateful
to those poor monks who -

673
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:15,358
<i>"...work so hard to educate you."</i>

674
01:12:15,827 --> 01:12:17,294
Precisely!

675
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:21,528
You're a real pain.
Leave me alone.

676
01:12:23,635 --> 01:12:25,398
Fernande!

677
01:12:28,406 --> 01:12:29,964
You know her?

678
01:12:32,410 --> 01:12:34,810
Julien, are you sure
you want to become a priest?

679
01:12:35,013 --> 01:12:37,106
- Would you object?
- Not at all.

680
01:12:37,415 --> 01:12:39,713
Your father and I would be proud.

681
01:12:40,518 --> 01:12:43,578
But why not engineering,
like Grandpa?

682
01:12:43,788 --> 01:12:45,346
Don't worry.

683
01:12:45,556 --> 01:12:49,185
He'll give up the church for a girl.
He's a lover boy, like Joseph.

684
01:12:59,003 --> 01:13:01,904
Laviron's sister is a real dish.

685
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:04,137
I'm gonna sweet-talk her.

686
01:13:10,882 --> 01:13:12,850
I can't kiss you anymore?

687
01:13:14,185 --> 01:13:17,052
Look at that.
You've got a little mustache.

688
01:13:18,623 --> 01:13:22,491
Can I go back to Paris with you?
Dad won't know.

689
01:13:37,675 --> 01:13:39,438
Did you have a good lunch?

690
01:13:46,084 --> 01:13:49,383
Your mother's nice.
Boy, can she talk fast.

691
01:13:49,754 --> 01:13:51,153
She's crazy.

692
01:13:54,959 --> 01:13:56,756
You'll see her again soon.

693
01:14:01,299 --> 01:14:02,891
I know how to thread it.

694
01:14:03,101 --> 01:14:05,934
It'll break like last time.

695
01:14:06,137 --> 01:14:07,866
No, it won't.

696
01:14:14,746 --> 01:14:16,577
<i>Your jam's great.</i>

697
01:14:17,148 --> 01:14:19,708
- Adrienne made it.
- Is that your sister?

698
01:14:20,017 --> 01:14:21,746
No, she's the cook.

699
01:14:23,888 --> 01:14:25,981
What's funny?
Don't you have a cook?

700
01:14:26,758 --> 01:14:29,750
You always eat out?
- No. My mom's a great cook.

701
01:14:39,036 --> 01:14:41,334
- You're eating my jam.
- Stop it.

702
01:14:41,539 --> 01:14:43,302
Move over, guys.

703
01:14:47,445 --> 01:14:49,037
We're ready.

704
01:14:49,647 --> 01:14:51,911
Turn out the lights, please.

705
01:15:57,615 --> 01:15:59,583
The fat lady's gonna go sliding.

706
01:16:00,685 --> 01:16:02,550
Looks like Mrs. Perrin.

707
01:16:43,561 --> 01:16:45,028
She's beautiful.

708
01:17:23,768 --> 01:17:25,565
He's in love.

709
01:17:27,238 --> 01:17:28,762
She loves him too.

710
01:18:24,495 --> 01:18:25,826
Shit!

711
01:18:43,647 --> 01:18:45,239
Time to get up.

712
01:18:45,716 --> 01:18:47,946
Quentin wets the bed.

713
01:18:48,853 --> 01:18:51,253
Quentin wets the bed.

714
01:18:58,329 --> 01:19:00,797
<i>Hurry up in the washroom.</i>

715
01:19:01,165 --> 01:19:03,065
It never fails.

716
01:19:04,435 --> 01:19:06,426
I'm having a great dream.

717
01:19:06,637 --> 01:19:10,334
I feel like peeing.
I open my fly. Everything's great.

718
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:15,811
Then I wake up and feel
the warm piss on my stomach.

719
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:18,207
It's no fun, let me tell you.

720
01:19:22,686 --> 01:19:24,517
Try it. Don't be scared.

721
01:19:25,756 --> 01:19:28,054
Go on. Keep your head up.

722
01:19:31,662 --> 01:19:33,027
Get back up.

723
01:19:33,397 --> 01:19:36,332
- Bed wetter.
- Sagard, you're gonna get it.

724
01:19:40,071 --> 01:19:42,301
You dirty thief!

725
01:19:42,506 --> 01:19:43,939
You're the thief!

726
01:19:44,141 --> 01:19:46,405
Just you wait, you thief!

727
01:19:47,645 --> 01:19:50,045
Father Michel,
I caught him stealing lard!

728
01:19:50,247 --> 01:19:52,215
He put it in his bag to sell!

729
01:19:53,417 --> 01:19:55,282
Not in front of the boys, Mrs. Perrin!

730
01:19:55,486 --> 01:19:58,512
- I told you he was stealing!
- It's not true, damn it!

731
01:19:58,722 --> 01:20:01,122
She's the thief!
She's a liar!

732
01:20:01,492 --> 01:20:03,221
Get back in the kitchen.

733
01:20:05,429 --> 01:20:07,829
I told that idiot he'd get caught.

734
01:20:11,335 --> 01:20:15,101
Joseph was selling our supplies
on the black market.

735
01:20:15,806 --> 01:20:19,867
Mrs. Perrin should have told us.
She may have been in on it.

736
01:20:20,211 --> 01:20:21,974
But that's not all.

737
01:20:22,913 --> 01:20:26,940
We found these in his locker.
Private food supplies.

738
01:20:27,384 --> 01:20:29,249
He named all seven of you.

739
01:20:29,453 --> 01:20:31,421
Whose pâté is this?

740
01:20:32,089 --> 01:20:33,488
Mine.

741
01:20:33,691 --> 01:20:36,159
- And the jam?
- Mine.

742
01:20:36,927 --> 01:20:38,588
Know what you are?

743
01:20:38,796 --> 01:20:41,196
A thief, just like Joseph.

744
01:20:41,398 --> 01:20:43,866
I didn't steal.
That jam was mine.

745
01:20:44,068 --> 01:20:45,797
You should've shared it.

746
01:20:46,270 --> 01:20:49,000
I believe true education
consists in teaching you

747
01:20:49,206 --> 01:20:51,401
to make good use
of your freedom.

748
01:20:51,942 --> 01:20:53,204
And this is what happens!

749
01:20:54,578 --> 01:20:58,207
You disgust me. There's nothing
I despise more than the black market.

750
01:20:58,649 --> 01:21:00,082
Always money!

751
01:21:00,451 --> 01:21:02,942
It wasn't for money.
We traded, that's all.

752
01:21:03,254 --> 01:21:04,744
For what?

753
01:21:05,055 --> 01:21:06,215
Cigarettes.

754
01:21:06,423 --> 01:21:11,122
Quentin, if it weren't for your parents,
I'd kick you out at once.

755
01:21:11,395 --> 01:21:13,124
You and your brother.

756
01:21:14,665 --> 01:21:17,031
I have to fire Joseph,
even though it's unfair.

757
01:21:19,603 --> 01:21:22,003
You're all confined to school
until Easter.

758
01:21:23,474 --> 01:21:25,374
Now go back to class.

759
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:36,415
Where do I go now?
I don't even have a place to sleep.

760
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:41,157
Get back to class.

761
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,160
Go see the bursar.
He'll pay you a month's wages.

762
01:21:52,369 --> 01:21:55,964
I end up taking the rap.
It's not fair.

763
01:21:58,576 --> 01:22:00,100
Come on, Joseph.

764
01:22:22,066 --> 01:22:24,557
- What are you doing here?
- Choir practice.

765
01:22:24,768 --> 01:22:27,931
You two help me
with the flowers for Sunday.

766
01:22:37,314 --> 01:22:39,874
<i>We'll take it from
"O Lord, in thee..."</i>

767
01:22:41,952 --> 01:22:43,579
Bonnet's not here?

768
01:22:43,787 --> 01:22:46,756
- No, miss. He's in the infirmary.
- Really?

769
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:19,212
It's easy.
Do this with your left hand.

770
01:23:35,039 --> 01:23:36,666
We'd better get to the shelter.

771
01:23:40,944 --> 01:23:43,970
<i>Everyone in the shelter, and hurry!</i>

772
01:23:55,626 --> 01:23:58,493
They won't miss us.
They never count.

773
01:24:57,454 --> 01:24:59,979
I hope the Americans land soon.

774
01:25:02,493 --> 01:25:04,654
Will you stay at this school
when the war's over?

775
01:25:06,997 --> 01:25:08,988
I don't know. I doubt it.

776
01:25:13,737 --> 01:25:15,295
You scared?

777
01:25:17,241 --> 01:25:18,731
All the time.

778
01:25:24,181 --> 01:25:26,012
How long's it been
since you saw him?

779
01:25:27,317 --> 01:25:30,081
My father?
Almost two years.

780
01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:34,958
I never see mine either.

781
01:25:51,308 --> 01:25:53,003
What are you doing here, Joseph?

782
01:25:54,478 --> 01:25:56,275
I forgot some things.

783
01:25:59,082 --> 01:26:00,709
What about you?

784
01:26:12,429 --> 01:26:15,796
"Could I, lad,
belong to anyone but you?

785
01:26:16,733 --> 01:26:20,100
She swiftly cast aside her veils,
removed her clothing,

786
01:26:20,304 --> 01:26:22,499
and appeared naked
as the day she was born.

787
01:26:22,706 --> 01:26:24,901
Blessed be the womb that bore her.

788
01:26:25,442 --> 01:26:29,105
The princess was
as soft and white as fine linen.

789
01:26:29,379 --> 01:26:31,939
Her whole being
exuded a scent of amber.

790
01:26:32,516 --> 01:26:34,916
He took her in his arms,

791
01:26:35,118 --> 01:26:38,519
probing her intimate depths,
and found she was a virgin pearl.

792
01:26:38,822 --> 01:26:42,314
His hand roved
over her lovely limbs and neck

793
01:26:42,526 --> 01:26:45,324
and through
the richness of her hair.

794
01:26:45,963 --> 01:26:49,899
She responded by eagerly displaying
her many gifts.

795
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:54,093
She had the sinuous grace of Araby,
Ethiopian ardor,

796
01:26:54,304 --> 01:26:57,535
the startled candor of the French,
the high art of the Indians,

797
01:26:57,741 --> 01:26:59,436
Yemeni coyness,

798
01:26:59,643 --> 01:27:03,670
and the narrow passage
of a Chinese girl.

799
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:09,048
Each embrace became a coupling,

800
01:27:09,253 --> 01:27:12,347
and each coupling
the wildest fornication,

801
01:27:12,556 --> 01:27:16,458
until, weary from
their passionate writhings,

802
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:21,620
they fell asleep in each other's arms,
drunk with pleasure.

803
01:27:21,965 --> 01:27:23,899
<i>Thus ended - "</i>

804
01:27:30,908 --> 01:27:34,571
The Russians have begun
a major offensive in the Ukraine.

805
01:27:35,546 --> 01:27:39,505
British radio claims
the Germans have been overrun

806
01:27:39,716 --> 01:27:42,446
along a 60-mile front west of Kiev.

807
01:27:42,686 --> 01:27:45,154
Radio Paris claims
the attack was repulsed

808
01:27:45,355 --> 01:27:47,186
with heavy losses.

809
01:27:47,758 --> 01:27:50,659
The truth is likely
somewhere between the two.

810
01:27:50,861 --> 01:27:53,762
<i>Radio Paris tells German lies</i>

811
01:27:53,964 --> 01:27:55,591
Meanwhile, in Italy,

812
01:27:55,799 --> 01:28:01,066
the Americans and British
are pinned down at Monte Cassino.

813
01:28:01,905 --> 01:28:04,874
Take out your notebooks
for an algebra problem.

814
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:10,002
We're going to multiply
two monomials.

815
01:28:11,815 --> 01:28:14,375
May I be excused, sir?
It's the soup.

816
01:28:14,685 --> 01:28:17,051
It's always you, Sagard.
Go on.

817
01:28:52,155 --> 01:28:54,521
Dr. Müller. Gestapo.

818
01:28:57,661 --> 01:29:00,562
Which one of you
is Jean Kippelstein?

819
01:29:05,369 --> 01:29:06,996
Answer me.

820
01:29:07,604 --> 01:29:09,265
There's no one by that name
in this class.

821
01:30:07,097 --> 01:30:08,758
Let's go.

822
01:30:39,463 --> 01:30:41,397
That boy is not French.

823
01:30:43,066 --> 01:30:45,000
He's a Jew.

824
01:30:46,336 --> 01:30:51,774
Your principal committed
a serious crime by hiding him.

825
01:30:55,912 --> 01:30:57,311
The school is closed.

826
01:30:57,514 --> 01:31:01,541
You have two hours to pack your bags
and line up in the yard.

827
01:31:07,491 --> 01:31:09,425
Was Bonnet a Jew?

828
01:31:14,297 --> 01:31:16,322
Keep calm, children.

829
01:31:21,304 --> 01:31:24,068
Quiet down
and listen to me, children.

830
01:31:25,509 --> 01:31:27,841
They've arrested Father Jean.

831
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:31,538
It seems we've been denounced.

832
01:31:32,082 --> 01:31:33,982
What about Bonnet?

833
01:31:34,184 --> 01:31:36,175
Bonnet, Dupré and Lafarge
are Jewish.

834
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:39,553
Father Jean took them in
because their lives were in danger.

835
01:31:40,791 --> 01:31:45,023
Go to the dormitory
and pack quickly and calmly.

836
01:31:45,362 --> 01:31:48,422
But first we'll say a prayer
for Father Jean and your friends.

837
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:53,627
Our Father, who art in heaven...

838
01:32:13,824 --> 01:32:15,655
Negus got away.

839
01:32:18,361 --> 01:32:19,726
They didn't get Negus.

840
01:32:19,930 --> 01:32:24,128
They're looking for him and Moreau.
Father Jean had resistance leaflets.

841
01:32:25,035 --> 01:32:28,163
When you're ready,
go to the dining hall.

842
01:32:28,471 --> 01:32:32,635
Quentin, pack Laviron's bag
and take it to the infirmary. Hurry!

843
01:32:32,843 --> 01:32:34,435
Want some help?

844
01:33:28,398 --> 01:33:32,095
Don't worry.
They'd have gotten me anyway.

845
01:33:35,071 --> 01:33:36,732
Negus got away.

846
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,439
I know.

847
01:33:45,382 --> 01:33:47,407
Take these.
I've read them all.

848
01:33:55,992 --> 01:33:57,857
<i>You want The Arabian Nights?</i>

849
01:34:24,321 --> 01:34:27,119
- What are you doing here?
- I brought his bag.

850
01:34:30,694 --> 01:34:32,423
Are you gonna get up?

851
01:34:36,066 --> 01:34:37,158
What do you want now?

852
01:34:37,367 --> 01:34:39,358
We can't stay here.
They're searching the attic.

853
01:34:57,887 --> 01:34:59,980
Sister, put a compress on him!

854
01:35:00,190 --> 01:35:01,452
Hurry!

855
01:35:01,725 --> 01:35:04,057
You'll get us all arrested!

856
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:33,082
There's a Jew here.
I'm sure of it.

857
01:35:33,656 --> 01:35:35,089
We haven't seen anyone.

858
01:35:35,291 --> 01:35:37,759
You, come here.

859
01:35:40,196 --> 01:35:42,460
Pull down your pants. Quick!

860
01:36:31,347 --> 01:36:32,939
What happened?

861
01:36:33,216 --> 01:36:35,741
- It's her.
- Get out!

862
01:36:37,587 --> 01:36:40,351
I'm going over the roof.
Good-bye, Julien.

863
01:37:10,487 --> 01:37:12,785
He's a friend.

864
01:37:18,428 --> 01:37:20,658
What are you doing with them?

865
01:37:25,001 --> 01:37:26,400
Here.

866
01:37:28,938 --> 01:37:30,997
Aren't you happy?
You'll get a vacation.

867
01:37:40,316 --> 01:37:41,840
You don't smoke?

868
01:37:50,226 --> 01:37:52,387
Don't worry about it.
They're just Jews.

869
01:37:57,467 --> 01:37:59,196
You really liked Bonnet?

870
01:38:07,043 --> 01:38:09,341
Don't act so pious!
You guys are to blame!

871
01:38:09,646 --> 01:38:12,376
I got fired
for doing business with you.

872
01:38:12,582 --> 01:38:14,607
Mrs. Perrin stole more than I did.

873
01:38:19,255 --> 01:38:20,950
Stop acting so pious!

874
01:38:21,157 --> 01:38:23,352
There's a war going on, kid.

875
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:46,612
Are there any other Jews among you?

876
01:38:49,252 --> 01:38:50,651
Answer me!

877
01:39:11,174 --> 01:39:14,234
What about you?
Sure you're not Jewish?

878
01:39:14,444 --> 01:39:15,706
Your name?

879
01:39:15,912 --> 01:39:17,743
Pierre de la Roziere.

880
01:39:18,047 --> 01:39:20,038
Go stand against the wall.

881
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:05,594
You think they'll arrest us?

882
01:40:05,895 --> 01:40:07,795
We didn't do anything.

883
01:40:32,588 --> 01:40:34,556
We were in the chapel.

884
01:40:35,124 --> 01:40:37,957
We came for confession.

885
01:40:47,970 --> 01:40:50,336
That soldier did his duty.

886
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:53,804
His orders were
to let no one leave.

887
01:40:55,378 --> 01:40:59,314
The strength of the German soldier
is his discipline.

888
01:41:00,416 --> 01:41:04,011
That's what you French lack:
discipline.

889
01:41:08,257 --> 01:41:09,986
We're not your enemies.

890
01:41:10,460 --> 01:41:14,590
You must help us rid France
of foreigners and Jews.

891
01:41:50,433 --> 01:41:53,402
Good-bye, Father.

892
01:41:57,073 --> 01:41:59,633
Good-bye, children.
See you soon.

893
01:42:23,566 --> 01:42:25,796
<i>Bonnet, Negus and Dupré</i>

894
01:42:26,002 --> 01:42:27,663
<i>died at Auschwitz.</i>

895
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:30,600
<i>Father Jean

897
01:42:36,312 --> 01:42:38,280
<i>More than 40 years have passed,</i>
