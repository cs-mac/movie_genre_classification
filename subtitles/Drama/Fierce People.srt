00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:39,773
<i>There's this tribe in South America</i> 
 <i>called the Ishkanani.</i>

3
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,263
<i>That means ''Fierce People''.</i>

4
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:47,711
<i>They're the meanest people</i> 
 <i>in the world.</i>

5
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,483
<i>They'll cut off your thumbs</i> 
 <i>and they'll shit in your hammock...</i>

6
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,178
<i>just like we say hello.</i>

7
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:00,058
<i>Look at that jerk!</i> 
 <i>That's me at 15.</i>

8
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,464
<i>That's me in our loft</i> 
 <i>in New York City.</i>

9
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,499
<i>That's my father, Fox Blanchard...</i>

10
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:09,798
<i>the anthropologist who made</i> 
 <i>first contact with the Ishkanani.</i>

11
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:15,141
<i>I was conceived after my mother</i> 
 <i>attended his lecture at her college.</i>

12
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,678
<i>Never met him. But just shy</i> 
 <i>of my 16th birthday...</i>

13
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,181
<i>he surprised me</i> 
 <i>with a copy of his documentary...</i>

14
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,947
<i>and an invitation to spend the summer</i> 
 <i>with him and the Fierce People.</i>

15
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,418
<i>That's my mom.</i>

16
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,853
<i>I don't know who that guy is.</i>

17
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:38,798
<i>Back then she was a professional</i> 
 <i>masseuse. Very professional.</i>

18
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,800
<i>She held a degree</i> 
 <i>in Swedish massage...</i>

19
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,065
<i>and she never slept with the clients.</i>

20
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,807
<i>This man probably got many things</i> 
 <i>from my mother that night...</i>

21
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:51,265
<i>but a Swedish massage</i> 
 <i>was definitely not one of them.</i>

22
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,483
<i>Mom liked to brag</i> 
 <i>that Ogden C. Osborne...</i>

23
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,451
<i>seventh richest man in America...</i>

24
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:02,856
<i>once gave her a $1,000 tip and</i> 
 <i>all he got was a one-hour back rub.</i>

25
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:07,486
<i>She bought a pair of binoculars for me</i> 
 <i>and eight balls of blow for herself.</i>

26
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,764
<i>It's supposed to be this big tragedy</i> 
 <i>if the kid's parents get high...</i>

27
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:15,131
<i>but my mom was kind of fun</i> 
 <i>when she was loaded.</i>

28
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,672
<i>I mean, how many kids can say</i> 
 <i>their moms like debating...</i>

29
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,334
<i>whether Space Ghost</i> 
 <i>could beat up Speed Racer?</i>

30
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,415
<i>But most of the time</i> 
 <i>she wasn't fun at all.</i>

31
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,082
<i>Especially in the morning.</i>

32
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,681
<i>Especially this morning.</i>

33
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,731
Finn! Get in here! 
 Get this thing off me!

34
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:48,368
Mom! What the hell are you doing? 
 We have to get my passport!

35
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:52,005
You gotta get it together! 
 I know what you are looking for!

36
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,375
I'll be fine as soon as 
 I get a pick-me-up, you know?

37
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,970
The passport office closes at four. 
 I'm leaving tomorrow.

38
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:03,909
<i>To the Ishkanani, life-altering</i> 
 <i>moments don't happen by accident.</i>

39
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,853
<i>They would say</i> 
 <i>that that bookcase didn't fall...</i>

40
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,855
<i>it was pushed by evil spirits...</i>

41
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,619
<i>who steal the souls of children</i> 
 <i>while they sleep.</i>

42
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,960
<i>I've always believed invisible</i> 
 <i>forces were at work that day.</i>

43
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,098
<i>Forces I didn't yet understand.</i>

44
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,603
There you are. Go.

45
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,747
Everybody on the ground! Now! 
 On the ground!

46
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:48,817
You could've said it was for me. 
 You didn't have to take the blame.

47
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,359
Really? Well, do you want me 
 to go back and tell the truth, mom?

48
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,525
It's right there. I would be 
 more than willing to do that.

49
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,151
-My God! I can't believe you're... 
 -Give me the phone.

50
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,877
The telephone, please?

51
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,755
I need to be alone.

52
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:27,230
<i>A series of forever-altering events.</i>

53
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:31,832
<i>A tumbled bookcase, a drug bust</i> 
 <i>and a phone call.</i>

54
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:36,499
<i>The phone call to the seventh</i> 
 <i>wealthiest man in America.</i>

55
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,181
<i>A man so rich, he promoted</i> 
 <i>his chauffeur to be chief of police...</i>

56
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,671
<i>in his own little kingdom.</i>

57
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,480
Mom?

58
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,194
-What? 
 <i>-There's a cop downstairs.</i>

59
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,162
<i>Pack your stuff.</i> 
 <i>We're leaving.</i>

60
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:03,202
Mom! What's going on? 
 Where's this guy taking us?

61
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,905
We're going to Mr. Osborne's place 
 in the country.

62
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:09,208
What? The geezer from the hospital? 
 What's she gonna do with him?

63
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,210
The courts have placed you 
 in my custody...

64
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,213
while your mom gives Mr. Osborne 
 physical therapy.

65
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:18,017
My mother is a fucking 
 masseuse, all right?

66
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,620
This summer, you're gonna have 
 to start watching your language.

67
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,623
Summer? What the hell do you mean? 
 Are you crazy?

68
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,059
I gotta be in New York 
 for court, mom.

69
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,728
No, you don't. Mr. Osborne 
 took care of all that.

70
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,264
-lsn't that great, Lambie? 
 -What do you mean?

71
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,892
I'm not such a bad mother.

72
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:43,343
<i>This is the story of my time</i> 
 <i>amongst the Fierce People...</i>

73
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,611
<i>during the summer of 1980...</i>

74
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,273
<i>in deepest, darkest New Jersey.</i>

75
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:31,770
Mr. Osborne's got 9,356 acres.

76
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,674
Over 10 square miles.

77
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,207
See that?

78
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:43,516
Makes his pear brandy 
 just the way they do in France.

79
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:11,707
Let's do it.

80
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,869
It's a dream.

81
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,381
-Thank you. Bye. 
 -All right.

82
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,678
-Thank you. 
 -Bye.

83
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:48,015
Thank God I wore underwear.

84
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,494
Making punch?

85
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,764
I got my first AA meeting 
 today, Finn.

86
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,645
-I'm gonna do things right this time. 
 -I'll say.

87
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,375
You've never had 
 a rich boyfriend before.

88
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:19,752
I told you, Mr. Osborne 
 is not my boyfriend.

89
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:23,586
He's a kind man 
 who's willing to help us out.

90
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,126
You find this book here?

91
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,296
I've had that book 
 for several months now.

92
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,231
Really? Does it have 
 a happy ending?

93
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,068
Does being a shit about all this 
 make it easier for you?

94
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,263
In a word, yes.

95
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,905
You gonna snort that?

96
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,607
Whose car?

97
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,109
Mr. Osborne's butler 
 brought it back for us to use.

98
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:55,287
-Can I drive it? 
 -You don't have a license.

99
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,990
You're the one who said 
 it was for us to use.

100
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,193
I did say that. 
 I know you're mad at me...

101
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:04,730
Mad? No, I'm grateful.

102
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,800
I almost got stuck having 
 to spend the entire summer...

103
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,336
in the South American rain forest 
 with the Ishkanani.

104
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:14,774
But, lucky me, I get to be here 
 with you, which is wonderful.

105
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,641
Go ahead. If you get arrested, 
 I'll just say you stole it.

106
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,138
It's actually not as much fun 
 if you're not down for the count.

107
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,967
Thank you, sir.

108
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,968
The servant's entrance is in the rear. 
 You'll find appropriate parking there.

109
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,578
Herbert! 
 <i>No!</i>

110
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,375
-Let me get that for you. You go in. 
 -Thank you.

111
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:33,919
Herbert, if you had any idea...

112
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,652
how long I've been waiting to get 
 this woman across my threshold.

113
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,761
-Whitney! 
 -Hi, Whitney!

114
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,626
Gentleman and a scholar.

115
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,605
<i>Whitney!</i>

116
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,751
Gentleman and a scholar.

117
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:49,728
<i>''Dear dad, since I can't be</i> 
 <i>with you and the Fierce People...</i>

118
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,755
<i>I'll make an anthropological</i> 
 <i>study of the people of Vlyvalle.</i>

119
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,102
<i>From the society magazines left</i> 
 <i>around the house we're staying in...</i>

120
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,605
<i>I'm able to figure out who is who.</i>

121
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,608
<i>It's weird how much</i> 
 <i>they're like a tribe.</i>

122
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:06,145
<i>By my count, Mr. Osborne</i> 
 <i>has had about six wives.</i>

123
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,614
<i>His daughter lives here</i> 
 <i>with her two kids.</i>

124
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,517
<i>The chief's grandson flies around</i> 
 <i>in a hot air balloon...</i>

125
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:16,422
<i>with a babe in a dashiki.</i> 
 <i>And his sister is into horses.</i>

126
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:19,124
<i>And there's this cop</i> 
 <i>who runs errands for Mr. Osborne.</i>

127
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,786
<i>And he looks just like Barry White.</i>

128
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,262
<i>Now Mom, she also</i> 
 <i>works for the chief.''</i>

129
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,231
<i>-Daddy?</i> 
 -Herbert.

130
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,806
-Daddy? Hi. 
 -Hi.

131
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:38,043
You didn't tell me 
 that your new friend was a doctor.

132
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,479
I felt so foolish yesterday.

133
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:45,351
The maid was just going on and on 
 and on about Dr. Earl this...

134
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,253
and Dr. Earl that.

135
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:51,883
-Felt foolish? Amazing. 
 -I thought she was just a masseuse.

136
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:57,095
Well, you were wrong. 
 Dr. Earl, meet my daughter Pilar.

137
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,830
It was nice to meet you, Dr. Earl.

138
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:14,075
Christ! No wonder I'm sick.

139
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,382
What's wrong?

140
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,191
I never told anyone I was a doctor!

141
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,231
For 10 square miles I'm king.

142
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:35,567
If I say you're a doctor, 
 you're a doctor.

143
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:39,867
Which is not to say there's anything 
 wrong with being a masseuse.

144
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,399
Okay?

145
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:49,579
Oh, God! Oh, God!

146
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:56,956
<i>''There's this big retard in the woods</i>

Sure.

155
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,571
You're weird.

156
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,220
-Jilly. 
 -I still have to vacuum.

157
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,485
Jilly, I'm sorry! It's just that...

158
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,849
Just never seen him before.

159

 <i>everyone has an animal spirit.</i>

<i>It's called your nureshi.</i>

161

<i>It's a spiritual counselor that keeps</i> 
 <i>the tribe from breaking your taboos.</i>

Mom! Look at that.

164
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:35,487
I'll stop giving you shit about 
 Osborne if you put that one on.

165
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,824
Come on, please! 
 And I'll put that tallyho outfit on...

166
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,527
and we can parade around 
 with that stuffed dog thing.

167
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,897
-The color matches your eyes. 
 -Hi!

168
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,666
Her eyes are the color of celery?

169
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,637
-How you doing, Liz? 
 -You know, one day at a time.

170
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:52,968
That's what they say, right?

171
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:58,844
This is my son, Finn. 
 And this is Dr. Leffler.

172
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,641
You can call me Dick.

173
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,275
Nice to meet you, Dr. Dick.

174
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:05,984
I left a message on your machine...

175
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,953
see if you wanted a lift 
 to tomorrow's nooner.

176
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,787
-I'd like that. 
 -Great. Till then.

177
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:13,882
See ya.

178
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:21,400
Mom? You're allowed to date Dr. Dick 
 while you're sleeping with Osborne?

179
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,503
His name is Dr. Leffler. 
 I met him at AA.

180
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,371
You're not supposed to know that 
 because it's anonymous.

181
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:29,675
I'm not dating him. And cut it out 
 about me screwing Osborne!

182
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,344
You think it's a good idea, 
 sleeping with Osborne's doctor?

183
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,745
Jesus, Finn!

184
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:37,583
<i>I didn't mind my mother doing Osborne.</i> 
 <i>I mean, she's done worse.</i>

185
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,609
<i>I just didn't like her thinking</i> 
 <i>that she was fooling me.</i>

186
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,972
Bryce! Open up this door.

187
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,305
Bryce!

188
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,875
Open this door immediately!

189
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,485
I know that you're in there.

190
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,859
Coco, if you wanna hide from me...

191
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:24,124
you should make less noise 
 when you're rutting!

192
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:31,036
-What are you doing? 
 -Nothing.

193
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:35,541
If you wanna keep your job, you 
 should spend less time eavesdropping.

194
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,668
I don't work for you.

195
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:44,245
-What's your name? 
 -Finn Earl.

196
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,448
Right, the famous doctor's son.

197
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,591
Bryce, this is rude!

198
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:56,823
You already stood me up for tennis! 
 We're gonna be late to see your father!

199
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,535
I don't know 
 what he sees in that girl.

200
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,505
She claims to be a Nigerian princess.

201
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:11,243
But people claim to be all sorts 
 of things they're not these days.

202
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,301
Don't they?

203
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,278
Honor bright.

204
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,709
Are they making faces 
 behind my back?

205
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,813
No.

206
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,749
Get back!

207
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,590
No Bryce, no Coco.

208
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,512
My thanks, young squire. 
 And your name is, sir?

209
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,848
-Finn. 
 -Finn!

210
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:54,219
You're a gentleman and a scholar, 
 and a most gifted bullshitter.

211
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,985
Thank you. Where is 
 your grandfather's house?

212
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,127
Walk through those big firs, stay 
 on the path and you can't miss it.

213
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,830
-Got it. Thanks. 
 -Good day.

214
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,094
-Bye, Finn. 
 -Bye.

215
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,411
You smoke pot with my girlfriend 
 again, you're dead.

216
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,915
Now get the fuck out of here.

217
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:38,856
Fuck!

218
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,570
Shit!

219
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,707
Shit!

220
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,316
Oh, man!

221
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,682
Oh, God!

222
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,695
I'm so sick of you bastards 
 shooting our deer!

223
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,425
I didn't do anything to your deer!

224
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:16,329
-Get it off me now! 
 -Shit.

225
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,469
Shit!

226
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:33,085
You're lucky you didn't hit a tendon. 
 How did you catch your foot?

227
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,950
I landed on a tin can.

228
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,123
-I don't like to be lied to. 
 -It's the truth, I swear.

229
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:41,760
-What are you guys doing here? 
 -We were upstairs visiting your father.

230
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,031
-What has my daughter done to you? 
 -Nothing. She helped me.

231
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:50,335
-If I were you, Finn, I'd sue us. 
 -Bryce, this is not funny.

232
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:53,972
I got here as quick as I could! 
 Lambie!

233
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,273
-Mom, I'm fine. 
 -What did you do?

234
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:57,442
-Nothing, nothing. Stop. 
 -Are you all right?

235
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:02,047
Don't freak out. I'm fine.

236
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,783
I'm sorry, I have no insurance.

237
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:07,152
She doesn't have to worry about 
 the bill. Finn and I are old friends.

238
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,677
-You raised a gentleman and a scholar. 
 -Thank you!

239
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,223
Where are we going?

240
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:23,767
Dad, I would like you 
 to meet Mr. Finn Earl.

241
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:32,910
What's wrong with him?

242
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,939
He's in a coma.

243
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,741
Gates says it was a stray bullet.

244
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,815
Fucking poachers will shoot 
 anything that moves.

245
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,523
You don't like me putting up 
 the traps, dad...

246
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,514
but somebody's gotta stop 'em.

247
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,294
Leffler says he can't hear 
 what I'm saying.

248
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,466
Do you think it's weird...

249
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,230
that I talk to my dad 
 if I know he can't hear me?

250
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:03,499
I've never even seen my dad 
 and I write him letters all the time.

251
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,444
He always likes meeting my friends.

252
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:27,294
We are friends, right?

253
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:32,571
You don't hold the whole trap thing 
 against me, do you?

254
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:36,701
No. I'm actually kinda glad 
 it happened.

255
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,939
I mean, you know...

256
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:47,876
Me, too.

257
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:03,663
Maya seems like a nice girl.

258
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,127
Yeah. She's okay.

259
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,209
She invited you to her birthday party?

260
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,817
No. Are you invited?

261
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,011
Nope.

262
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,961
<i>Adolescence is a time of indulgence</i> 
 <i>for the girls.</i>

263
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,797
<i>What's the chivalrous thing to do</i> 
 <i>when you make out with a girl...</i>

264
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:36,801
<i>with her comatose father laying</i> 
 <i>next to you like a big root vegetable?</i>

265
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:40,906
<i>I knew I should call her.</i> 
 <i>But what do I say?</i>

266
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,641
<i>''Hi. I like kissing you.</i>

267
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:45,576
<i>Thanks for letting me touch</i> 
 <i>your boob. Can I do it again?''</i>

268
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,305
Finn!

269
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,737
Finn?

270
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:56,988
Could I have some privacy, please? 
 I'm trying to make a phone call.

271
00:25:56,988 --> 00:26:00,116
-Okay, I'll tell Maya Langley to beat it. 
 -What?

272
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:02,985
Shoot!

273
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:05,386
Damnit!

274
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,156
Shut up!

275
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,441
-I just Windexed that! 
 -Yeah, well, too bad.

276
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,603
-Hi. 
 -Hi.

277
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,578
I got tired of waiting 
 for you to call me.

278
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,821
I don't know if I should let 
 my sister see that, Finn.

279
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:32,223
That's a film my dad made...

280
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:35,460
-on his first trip to South America. 
 -Your father's Fox Blanchard?

281
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,429
I read him in my anthro class 
 at Harvard. Maya...

282
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,626
do you realize this man's father 
 is the Elvis of anthropology?

283
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:44,631
-Well, I guess I do now. 
 -It's movie time.

284
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,735
-What is that? 
 -A tapir.

285
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,834
It's a small hog pig-like animal.

286
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:55,146
How are they gonna eat all that?

287
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:58,638
After a feast, the women 
 hide the leftovers in their vaginas.

288
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,680
-That's disgusting! 
 -Fantastic!

289
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,388
God, your dad is so cool.

290
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:10,856
You look like him.

291
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:14,599
I was gonna spend the summer 
 doing field work.

292
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:17,369
I would kill to be doing that 
 with your father.

293
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,738
-Why don't you go? 
 -I got busted.

294
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:22,507
-What for? 
 -Coke.

295
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:25,577
Very cool. I'm impressed, Finn.

296
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:29,911
My mother thought living in Vlyvalle 
 would be a wholesome influence for me.

297
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,455
I think the Ishkanani 
 have it all figured out.

298
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,149
What do you mean?

299
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,152
It's fuck, kill.

300
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:49,300
Unlike us domesticated creatures, 
 they like something, they fuck it.

301
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,063
If they don't, they kill it.

302
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:54,906
-Do you always have to say ''fuck''? 
 -Virgins fall into two categories.

303
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,074
-Finn, you paying attention? 
 -Yeah.

304
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,443
They either love the F word 
 and they don't wanna do it...

305
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:01,579
or they hate the F word 
 and they're dying to do it.

306
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,449
-Cut it out! 
 -Let's watch it backwards.

307
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,974
Stop it!

308
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,292
Fuck. Kill.

309
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:23,524
Fuck. Kill. 
 Fuck. Kill.

310
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,144
-Want me to see if I can get you in? 
 -Maya invited you!

311
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,044
You want me to speak to her?

312
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,380
For me? 
 Oh, no. That's not likely.

313
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,612
Then I guess I should 
 throw this away then.

314
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,624
-Are you serious? 
 -Serious.

315
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:22,286
-Oh, really! 
 -Really.

316
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:24,526
My foot!

317
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,389
So that's Osborne's new super drug.

318
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:55,382
I wonder if she charges the old goat 
 by the hour or by the orgasm.

319
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,904
-You know, Mom? 
 -What?

320
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:09,941
Since you've gotten sober, 
 you've gotten much better looking.

321
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:14,310
-It's hardly the time to put me down. 
 -No, I'm serious! Really!

322
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,916
-Okay. Thank you. 
 -You're welcome.

323
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,518
-I've gotta have a drink. 
 -No, you don't have to have...

324
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,921
-Just a little get-through. Relax. 
 -You don't have...

325
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:25,287
-Just to calm my nerves. 
 -Liz!

326
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,158
-Liz... 
 -Hi!

327
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,592
-I've been looking everywhere for you. 
 -I'm right here.

328
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,497
-You look amazing. 
 -Thank you.

329
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,694
-I want you to meet some friends. 
 -Okay. All right.

330
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:53,585
I go to the doctor. I feel like I got 
 an elephant standing on my chest.

331
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,486
He says, ''There's nothing wrong 
 with you. Go home.''

332
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,722
So I go to this other doctor, 
 he gives me antibiotics.

333
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:02,853
-He's fantastic. I mean I feel... 
 -What?

334
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:08,099
What the hell is that? 
 Who did that?

335
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:12,537
I like the way you eat shrimp. 
 Marcus Gates, son of a black man.

336
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,595
Finn Earl.

337
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,441
Osborne invited me here 
 to meet a fat cat...

338
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,776
who bought a scholarship 
 to Princeton.

339
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,111
What's your excuse?

340
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:24,015
I'm an anthropologist doing 
 a study of primitive peoples.

341
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,984
You definitely picked 
 one twisted tribe.

342
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,219
I'm here. 
 You got any questions?

343
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:36,194
Yeah. Who's the guy 
 with the woman in the crown?

344
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:39,998
Oh, yeah. Gershons. 
 Hawaiian royalty.

345
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,567
The husband pulled strings 
 for Osborne over on Wall Street.

346
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,159
Hawaiians?

347
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:48,506
Why don't any of the Hawaiians here 
 look Hawaiian?

348
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:52,310
It's asshole code for people 
 of the Jewish persuasion.

349
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,178
The natives don't want anybody 
 to know that they're anti-Semitic.

350
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:21,294
My age ended my position in life.

351
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,608
It warms my heart...

352
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,411
to see you all so...

353
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,520
-Grandpa? 
 -Daddy?

354
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,385
-Daddy! 
 -Shit.

355
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,583
I just wanted to see 
 if you'd miss me.

356
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,055
I really hurt my knees.

357
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,164
Herbert, my hat.

358
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:58,267
Maestro, if you please.

359
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:05,073
<i>A pretty girl is like a melody</i>

360
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:10,077
<i>That haunts you night and day</i>

361
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:17,818
<i>Just like the strain</i> 
 <i>of a haunting refrain</i>

362
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:21,432
<i>She'll start up on a marathon</i>

363
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:25,459
<i>And run around your brain</i> 
 <i>You can't escape</i>

364
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,172
<i>She's in your memory</i>

365
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:34,471
<i>By morning, night and noon</i>

366
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:42,144
<i>She will leave you</i> 
 <i>and then come back again</i>

367
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:47,781
<i>A pretty girl</i> 
 <i>is just like a pretty tune</i>

368
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,053
Happy birthday, Maya.

369
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,158
Finn!

370
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,057
Finn!

371
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:02,131
-They were horrible to you, right? 
 -No.

372
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,934
Sexy liar.

373
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:11,616
I didn't know the Ishkanani 
 went for public displays of affection.

374
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:14,052
Maya, when did you start 
 dating the help?

375
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,688
For your information, Finn's mother 
 and my grandfather are old friends.

376
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:20,748
Paige, can you help me with this? 
 I can't seem to get it right.

377
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:24,659
-Bryce, you're not wearing underwear! 
 -I know!

378
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,787
It looks like a penis, only larger.

379
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,423
-Paige? 
 -Here comes my mother.

380
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,935
Hold this. Hi, Mommy.

381
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:44,749
Pay attention, Finn. There's gonna be 
 a quiz on this afterwards.

382
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,718
-Mom, spare us. 
 -Your mother is teaching Yoga...

383
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:52,924
to Happy Rockefeller. The stepson 
 was eaten by cannibals.

384
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,461
McCallum is over there.

385
00:34:56,461 --> 00:35:00,431
-lan and Dwayne look like relatives. 
 -That's very observant, Finn.

386
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:04,202
They're not the only ones of our tribe 
 with hair the color of cheese doodles.

387
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:07,772
-There's Pete, the bartender. 
 -Bryce...

388
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,603
Thank you, Jenny.

389
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:14,245
Take Jenny. 
 All their mothers were maids.

390
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:17,215
They used to call him 
 ''Maid To Order McCallum''.

391
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,418
Why would any maid 
 want to sleep with McCallum?

392
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,819
Not all of them did.

393
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,855
McCallum doped up Dwayne's mother 
 and dead-horsed her.

394
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,618
That's just vulgar.

395
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:39,533
I'm getting tired.

396
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:52,678
Not too many of those, Pilar. 
 Good night.

397
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:54,742
Herbert.

398
00:35:58,389 --> 00:35:59,754
We can smoke.

399
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:11,235
Were you one of the doctors who worked 
 on my father at Sloan Kettering?

400
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,999
We both know I'm not a doctor.

401
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,766
I thought as much.

402
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:23,379
So how long exactly have you 
 been friends with my father?

403
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,576
You should ask him that.

404
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:31,254
If my father answered my questions, 
 then I wouldn't have to ask you.

405
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:32,479
Liz...

406
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:34,748
Hi.

407
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,023
I'll leave you to it.

408
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:46,569
I wanted to wait before this 
 next song to ask you to dance.

409
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,941
-You don't wanna do that. 
 -It's just a sip.

410
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,670
It's more vodka than Cola.

411
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,243
We let Pilar think we don't know.

412
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,038
So much for the slow dance.

413
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:02,076
-Let's cut a rug. 
 -All right.

414
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:03,777
Ready?

415
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,649
-Here we go. 
 -My God.

416
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:15,519
-Downshift to second! 
 -What the hell do you mean?

417
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:24,328
You gotta spend the night!

418
00:38:57,268 --> 00:39:00,471
Mr. Osborne wants you at his house 
 for lunch tomorrow...

419
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,666
one o'clock sharp. Don't be late.

420
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,751
Finn Earl, sir.

421
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:26,954
Hi.

422
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,123
Hi.

423
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:36,741
You know, I hear a lot of rumors...

424
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:41,045
and innuendo 
 about your mother and me.

425
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:45,383
The only innuendo I know 
 is that you're nailing my mom.

426
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,647
Nailing your mom?

427
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:54,556
Don't you ever use that expression 
 in reference to your mother, you hear?

428
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,523
Your mother and l...

429
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,194
we're just friends.

430
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:06,226
What?

431
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:10,508
You bring us out here, 
 you give us a house...

432
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:14,137
but there's nothing between you? 
 Why should I believe you?

433
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:15,937
Sit down.

434
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,473
Sit down!

435
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,421
What are you doing?

436
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:45,032
Take a good look, sonny. 
 You're only gonna get to see it once.

437
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,411
You don't have any balls.

438
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:53,943
Precisely.

439
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:59,250
Surgical procedure 
 is called an orchiectomy.

440
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,527
The theory being that 
 if they cut off your balls...

441
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:06,330
it'll slow down your cancer. 
 My prostate...

442
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:10,301
You know what a prostate is, right? 
 It's a little thing, it's up your ass.

443
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:14,067
Mine, unfortunately, 
 was the size of a baseball.

444
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:16,730
I was in a coma.

445
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:20,005
My then wife gave them 
 the green light.

446
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,340
When I met your mother...

447
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:26,877
I was a eunuch.

448
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,683
You know what a eunuch is, don't you?

449
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:39,597
Well, if that doesn't satisfy you, 
 you can get the hell out of my house.

450
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:43,124
On the other hand, if it does, 
 we could have lunch. Your choice.

451
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,304
-Lunch. 
 -Good choice.

452
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:48,498
Herbert!

453
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,639
When they cut your balls off...

454
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,680
you'd expect your voice 
 to go up an octave.

455
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,147
But mine didn't.

456
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,918
I'm not trying to be a wiseass...

457
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,991
but why are you and my mother 
 such good friends?

458
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:15,958
Wiseass.

459
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,969
I didn't meet your mother 
 until a year ago.

460
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,808
<i>The surgeons had just performed...</i>

461
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,570
their dastardly deed on me.

462
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,342
<i>I was pretty down.</i>

463
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:37,912
-Hello. 
 <i>-And your mother walked into my room.</i>

464
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:40,412
Hi.

465
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,719
She was like an angel.

466
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,792
I dropped my cartridge.

467
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:50,492
I tell you what...

468
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:55,773
if you still wanna pull the trigger 
 after I give you a foot rub...

469
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,035
I'll give you your bullet.

470
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,266
Okay?

471
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:01,744
<i>She saved my life.</i>

472
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,550
Here. You're gonna need this.

473
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:12,713
It's a toothpick. Gold.

474
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,826
Gold toothpick?

475
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,336
<i>''Dear dad, today I met the chief.</i>

476
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:30,372
<i>It's weird how wrong</i> 
 <i>you can get things in your head.''</i>

477
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:38,203
Good morning, sir.

478
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,148
No, hold on a second.

479
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,118
Not like that.

480
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,197
That lower down the shaft. 
 Take this. Couple them together.

481
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:54,824
-Over? 
 -Wait a second.

482
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,430
Stand still.

483
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:05,502
What are you doing?

484
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:09,206
lmagining what it would've been like 
 to have been with you.

485
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:18,310
-How was it? 
 -It's not over yet.

486
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:26,993
I almost forgot, I've gotta move 
 our one o'clock to four.

487
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,598
That doesn't work for me.

488
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,704
Dick has invited me 
 to the golf luncheon.

489
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:42,703
The golf luncheon. 
 And that's important, isn't it?

490
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,479
Well, it is important to me.

491
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:51,848
I don't pay you to go to 
 golf luncheons with Dr. Dick.

492
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,595
I'm going whether you like it or not.

493
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:01,598
I'll have a severance check 
 dropped off for you this afternoon.

494
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:04,465
And thank you 
 for fucking up my game!

495
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,194
Shit.

496
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:14,508
Don't do this to me.

497
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:24,444
How can someone 
 so exquisitely beautiful...

498
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,250
so intelligent...

499
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,857
and so complicated as you are...

500
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:37,094
get sucked in by a scared, 
 suburban phony like Dick Leffler?

501
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,497
I'm really trying...

502
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,800
to take my life seriously.

503
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:48,969
Okay.

504
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,772
Look...

505
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,916
you take the next two weeks off...

506
00:45:57,121 --> 00:46:00,887
and you two lovebirds can have 
 my place in East Hampton.

507
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:03,950
Really?

508
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:09,066
Thank you! Thank you.

509
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:13,867
Just remember, this place isn't 
 as goddamn fabulous as it looks.

510
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:23,807
You ever notice the resemblance 
 between your grandfather and Finn?

511
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:30,053
If I thought Finn was one 
 of grandpa's bastards...

512
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:32,487
I wouldn't let him sleep 
 with my sister, would l?

513
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,326
Fortune time!

514
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:39,596
-What are you doing? It's my deal. 
 -Relax. Enjoy the show.

515
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:42,800
You're not going to do something 
 that I'm gonna regret, are you?

516
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,735
This is going to be fun.

517
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,970
-It's gonna be fun for everyone. 
 -It's never fun.

518
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,807
-No, Bryce. 
 -Last time he did this, people cried.

519
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,742
-You got me fired once this summer. 
 -You'll like this.

520
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:56,237
For Marcus Gates I predict...

521
00:46:56,747 --> 00:47:00,239
in 20 years time, 
 you'll be senator...

522
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:02,510
from the great state of New Jersey.

523
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,655
-Bravo, Marcus. 
 -Senator Gates.

524
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,917
Well done.

525
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,725
What, we don't rate 
 a fortune of our own?

526
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,750
No, you both inherit 
 from the same trust.

527
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:14,554
See, they're cousins. Coal mine.

528
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:18,867
I smell Episcopalian voodoo.

529
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,498
The past and the future 
 are connected here.

530
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,802
Oh, yes.

531
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:29,980
Your great-grandfather made his fortune 
 by putting children to work in mines.

532
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,541
When they got older 
 and went on strike, he shot them.

533
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:35,308
Bryce.

534
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:39,583
He poisoned his partner 
 and he had sex with his son's wife.

535
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,050
Here's where the curse comes in.

536
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:47,698
A robber baron begets 
 three generations of losers...

537
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,529
each lamer than the next.

538
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:52,736
By the time you're old and gray...

539
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:56,399
you'll have to suck up to people you 
 wouldn't share a toilet seat with now.

540
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:00,738
You are such an asshole, Bryce!

541
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,671
I don't make the future, 
 I just predict it.

542
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:10,888
-Finn! 
 -Bryce, please don't. Seriously.

543
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:15,325
Stand up. Trust me, you'll like it. 
 For Finn I predict...

544
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,027
graduation from Harvard 
 with honors.

545
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:22,297
First contact with a tribe 
 of cannibals in South America.

546
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:28,199
I see a beautiful wedding 
 to my lovely sister, Maya.

547
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:34,303
And last but not least I predict 
 lifelong friendship with myself.

548
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:40,950
-Welcome to the tribe, brother. 
 -Thank you.

549
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:50,717
Hi!

550
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,023
Apple juice.

551
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,844
What is this place?

552
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:56,456
This is my island. You're the first boy 
 I ever brought here.

553
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,262
Take off your clothes.

554
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:18,039
Close your eyes. Come on.

555
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,891
-Shit! 
 -Oh, Jesus!

556
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,931
-What the hell was that? 
 -Our clothes are gone!

557
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:25,400
Oh, my God! Christ!

558
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:32,305
When you and Osborne talk, 
 do I ever come up?

559
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,008
How do you mean?

560
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:38,687
Sometimes I think he hasn't made up 
 his mind about me.

561
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:42,950
-He thinks you're great. 
 -He said that?

562
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,028
Well, he must like you a little...

563
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:48,520
or he wouldn't have given us his house 
 in East Hampton for two weeks.

564
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:50,458
How about that?

565
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:55,828
He did what? 
 What did you tell him?

566
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:57,504
What does he think this is?

567
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,469
I might have said that you liked me.

568
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:07,406
Jesus Christ. What are you 
 trying to do to me here?

569
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:09,918
Why? What just happened?

570
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,523
Look, the bastard lost his balls, 
 but he didn't lose his pride.

571
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,115
There are rules out here.

572
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:18,057
This you do not advertise.

573
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,462
ls that so, Dr. Dick?

574
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:27,571
If I were you, I'd tell your son 
 to get ready for a fall.

575
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:28,595
My son?

576
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:32,175
He's hanging out with the Langley kids, 
 getting bombed every night.

577
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:35,178
What? Finn?

578
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:38,944
Alcohol is the least of it. Bryce 
 and Maya are always getting high.

579
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:44,479
Listen to me. My son 
 would never do drugs.

580
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:46,388
You just don't get it, do you?

581
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,887
You and Finn are toys to them.

582
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:52,685
And why would you set your son up 
 for a lifestyle he's never gonna have?

583
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:14,511
Where have you been?

584
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:18,588
-I was swimming up at the lake. 
 -Naked? With Maya?

585
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,658
-Somebody stole my clothes. 
 -Jesus, what's all over you?

586
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:25,729
Mom, come on! Could I get dressed 
 and then we'll talk about it?

587
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:27,128
Let's talk about this.

588
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:30,967
-You know what this is? 
 -It's not mine.

589
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:32,302
-Really? 
 -Really.

590
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:34,634
-Cut the crap! 
 -No, really.

591
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,807
-You wanna get fucked up? 
 -Mom, that's not...

592
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:40,844
-What are you doing? 
 -I have a great idea.

593
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:44,047
-What are you doing? 
 -Let's get high together.

594
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,514
Stop. Don't do it.

595
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:49,886
Mother, son. 
 I know about this, Finn.

596
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:53,413
Mom, don't do this. Please stop!

597
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:55,525
-Don't do it! 
 -You ready?

598
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:59,518
-Please, stop it! Mom, stop! 
 -Why?

599
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:04,464
'Cause I'm tired of being your excuse 
 for screwing up your life.

600
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:26,646
Get up.

601
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:29,086
-Summer's over for you. 
 -Mom?

602
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:33,897
There's gonna be some changes 
 around here. Like getting a job.

603
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:38,568
I'll tell Mr. Osborne we don't need 
 Jilly anymore. You'll clean the house.

604
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:40,303
I'll pay you whatever Jilly got.

605
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:43,173
What? You bring me to a place 
 where everyone's rich...

606
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,073
and you want me to be the maid?

607
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,530
Finn! <i>Che cosa fai, kiddo?</i>

608
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,498
Actually, I'm looking for you.

609
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:11,759
Get in the car.

610
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:24,971
Would madam prefer her coffee 
 with one lump or two this morning?

611
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:28,985
I took the liberty of making 
 an assortment of breakfast meats...

612
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:30,646
for madam this morning.

613
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:34,552
This isn't gonna let you off the hook.

614
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:41,264
Can you not do that right now? 
 I'm eating.

615
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:43,199
-So sorry, madam. 
 -Thank you.

616
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:45,759
Of course! Very, very sorry.

617
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:50,662
-What are you doing, Finn? 
 -Corralling dust bunnies!

618
00:56:56,613 --> 00:57:00,083
You know, I'm really gonna miss 
 working for you.

619
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,519
-What are you talking about? 
 -I'm afraid...

620
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:05,283
I'm going to have 
 to give madam notice.

621
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:08,725
I'm still mad at you, Finn.

622
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:12,162
I know it'll be very difficult 
 to find someone to replace me...

623
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,631
but you're just gonna have to.

624
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:18,465
-You don't get it. I'm serious. 
 -So am l.

625
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:22,028
I'm working for Mr. Osborne now. 
 Full time.

626
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:27,444
Really? Well, then go downstairs, 
 get on the phone...

627
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,479
and tell Mr. Osborne you're sorry, 
 but you don't wanna work for him.

628
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:33,381
I'm sorry, I can't lie to someone 
 who's done so much for us.

629
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:38,018
-You don't call the shots here. 
 -No, Mr. Osborne does.

630
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,683
Pretty snappy, uh?

631
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,311
What is this?

632
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:14,424
-Like a war club? 
 -Jesus Christ. Be careful, son.

633
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:16,858
-Why? 
 -My testicles are in there.

634
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,286
Stop.

635
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:20,890
You're so...

636
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:27,070
No, that's from Borneo. 
 Witch doctor gave it to me in 1945.

637
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:31,370
There's a picture around here of me 
 and Stillwell and Doolittle somewhere.

638
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:33,636
I'd love you to find that.

639
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,546
Any of the pictures 
 from World War ll...

640
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:39,640
just put it in a stack 
 marked ''World War lI''.

641
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:42,148
Christ, would you look at that!

642
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:47,156
And anything you don't know 
 or don't recognize somebody...

643
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:50,353
just put it in a pile called 
 ''See Osborne''.

644
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:55,457
-That is gonna be a pretty big pile. 
 -That's why they call it a job.

645
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,300
Who is this?

646
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:16,418
That's Creamsicle.

647
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:20,419
-Her name was Creamsicle? 
 -No.

648
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:24,422
No, she smelled like a Creamsicle.

649
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:28,892
Mr. Osborne, 
 Creamsicle's don't smell.

650
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:38,931
Smells good, doesn't it?

651
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,539
King of Norway introduced me to her.

652
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,071
She had a mole...

653
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:49,046
shaped like Cuba.

654
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:54,079
She and Billy Holiday 
 got into a catfight over me.

655
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:02,130
-Feet. 
 -Feet.

656
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:09,699
The two of them used to sing duets, 
 one in each ear.

657
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:12,939
Billy Holiday could sure sing.

658
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:17,007
Creamsicle used to hit the high notes.

659
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:20,082
-Bye, Finn. 
 -Bye.

660
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:23,976
Feet.

661
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,665
-Jesus! 
 -You have no right...

662
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:37,700
to undermine my authority 
 with my son.

663
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,303
He asked me for a job. 
 I gave him a job.

664
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,839
And thank you, too, 
 for sabotaging me with the doctor.

665
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:47,538
-The house in East Hampton. 
 -You knew it would scare him off!

666
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:52,247
No, it was a gamble. I just thought 
 the odds were in my favor.

667
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:59,646
You don't want Finn lollygagging around 
 the clubhouse all day long.

668
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:05,758
Let him work for me. 
 I'll teach him some things.

669
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:09,599
-Things he can never use? 
 -For God's sakes, woman!

670
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,464
What is your problem?

671
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:13,493
I don't like...

672
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,171
feeling jealous of my son's happiness.

673
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:23,137
You are such a good mother.

674
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,348
Not yet. But I will be.

675
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:52,275
Robert! He practically did 
 every permutation of that...

676
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:55,411
-That's very dashing. 
 -That's me.

677
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:59,282
The one next to me is 
 Walter Chrysler and that's...

678
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:01,150
What's his name?

679
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,311
-The fella who wrecked the railroads. 
 -What's this?

680
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:11,194
Bryce and me. Hot-air balloon race. 
 We won the State Championship.

681
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:14,464
ls that Maya's father? 
 He was shot?

682
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:17,433
-Yeah, stray bullet. 
 -Who shot him?

683
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:18,957
Probably a poacher.

684
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:24,601
I think maybe it was somebody 
 who didn't like rich people.

685
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:45,762
Grandpa! I'm sorry I'm late. 
 I couldn't find my uniform.

686
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:49,027
-Because I gave it to Finn! 
 -Daddy, I don't think it's a good idea.

687
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:52,969
For Christ sakes, he's won it 4 times 
 in a row! You don't care, do you?

688
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:55,505
No, that's fine. 
 I was gonna suggest it myself.

689
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:59,375
Good luck. Everyone's counting on you. 
 Gotta keep that trophy in the family.

690
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:02,211
Bryce, I've never done this before. 
 I don't know what to do.

691
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:03,906
Ballooners!

692
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:08,885
If he has a heart attack while you're 
 up there, just pull that cord slowly.

693
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:13,015
I'm not deaf, you know? 
 Come on, Finn, get in here.

694
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:18,349
A heart attack...

695
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:23,566
Looks like you've been 
 replaced, Bryce.

696
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:27,593
Good to have new blood in the race. 
 Gives the competition a chance.

697
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:30,870
It's okay, mom.

698
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:32,701
Steady!

699
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:36,840
Go!

700
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:38,771
High. Smile.

701
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:40,699
Very good!

702
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:49,113
Excuse me. Sorry. 
 Just one second, everyone.

703
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:52,321
-I have an announcement to make. 
 -This better be good, Bryce!

704
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:54,790
-Bryce for president! 
 -Tonight's your lucky night.

705
01:04:54,790 --> 01:05:00,162
Thank you. To acknowledge the good 
 fortune we enjoy here in Vlyvalle...

706
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:03,499
next year, over on the south pasture...

707
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:06,491
we're gonna be opening 
 the Ogden C. Osborne Youth Center.

708
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:09,805
It's gonna be a year-round home...

709
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:11,974
-Did you know about this? 
 -No. Did you?

710
01:05:11,974 --> 01:05:13,965
...for kids who don't have 
 the same opportunity.

711
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:16,677
Over my dead body.

712
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:46,240
Stop it!

713
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:48,708
What are you doing?

714
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:01,216
Stop!

715
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:25,680
<i>Throughout history, rape has been</i> 
 <i>used as a weapon in tribal warfare.</i>

716
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:34,223
<i>An Ishkanani warrior believes</i> 
 <i>if he is humiliated...</i>

717
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:38,861
<i>his ''nureshi''or animal spirit</i> 
 <i>will be so ashamed...</i>

718
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:43,423
<i>that it will literally claw itself</i> 
 <i>free from the warrior's soul.</i>

719
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:59,275
Lambie!

720
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:04,050
It's time to get up!

721
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:10,926
Mr. Osborne called! 
 <i>He wants to start early today!</i>

722
01:07:10,926 --> 01:07:12,154
<i>Finn!</i>

723
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:25,434
Hey, sleepy. What time did you 
 get in last night anyway?

724
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,233
Honey?

725
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:30,980
What is this? 
 What happened to you?

726
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,845
Somebody jumped me.

727
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:34,240
What?

728
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,751
-What does that mean? Who? 
 -I didn't see him.

729
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:42,024
What do you mean? 
 Somebody just hit you and ran away?

730
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:43,651
Yeah, sort of.

731
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:47,963
-Where did this happen, Finn? 
 -In the field, mom.

732
01:07:47,963 --> 01:07:50,830
-In the field? 
 -I'm fine! Just let me sleep!

733
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:53,793
Okay.

734
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:57,763
Okay.

735
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:05,347
Gates, I did not bring my son here 
 to get beat up in a field!

736
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:07,008
I wanna know who did this!

737
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:15,651
I'm okay.

738
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:22,394
I want you to let me pamper you. 
 I brought you some ice for your eye.

739
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:31,464
Honey?

740
01:08:33,642 --> 01:08:37,942
-What happened to you? 
 -Mom, just leave it alone.

741
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:43,618
Mom, please.

742
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:47,078
It's okay. Let me see.

743
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:50,417
It's okay. Let me see.

744
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:56,959
My God!

745
01:08:58,934 --> 01:08:59,992
Baby!

746
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:05,341
Baby! Oh, my God!

747
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:10,212
Mom, please wait! You can't...

748
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:14,450
-You can't tell anyone. 
 -Who did this to you?

749
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:20,355
I don't know! But you can't 
 tell anyone, mom. Swear.

750
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:24,484
He's fine.

751
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:28,222
He just needs some rest.

752
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:33,836
-You didn't sound like he was fine. 
 -I know. I overreacted.

753
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,772
Let me go up and talk to him. 
 Maybe I can jog his memory.

754
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:41,010
-He didn't see who did it. 
 -I want Dick to have a look at him.

755
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,679
-Stay where you are. 
 -In order to make an official report...

756
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,613
I don't need an official report.

757
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:50,619
If you need help with anything, 
 just gimme a call.

758
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:53,155
-I need some painkillers. 
 -I can only prescribe painkillers if...

759
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:55,089
Give her the goddamn pills.

760
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:04,600
Thank you. I'm sorry 
 if I worried anybody.

761
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:07,937
Liz, tell him not to worry. 
 We'll find out who did this.

762
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:08,995
Okay.

763
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:22,073
Find out what really happened.

764
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:30,349
I'm so sorry.

765
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:34,996
I thought we'd be safe here.

766
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:40,635
I just want everything to be okay.

767
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,672
I'm so sorry.

768
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:55,750
<i>I made a list of all the people</i> 
 <i>who might have had reason to do this.</i>

769
01:10:56,518 --> 01:11:00,750
<i>Once you've lost your nureshi,</i> 
 <i>there's only one way to get it back.</i>

770
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:04,627
<i>Find the guy who did it,</i> 
 <i>cut his heart out...</i>

771
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:06,561
<i>and show it to the village.</i>

772
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:22,807
What are you doing?

773
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:27,674
Packing us. For New York.

774
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:30,983
-I shouldn't have brought you here. 
 -I'm staying.

775
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:33,218
-What? 
 -I'm staying.

776
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:35,749
Why?

777
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:40,621
So I can find out 
 who did this to me.

778
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:49,638
I thought you said 
 you didn't want anyone to know.

779
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:50,764
I don't.

780
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:56,670
Just can't leave here 
 until I get my nureshi to come back.

781
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:04,379
-Lambie... 
 -Don't call me Lambie anymore.

782
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:19,093
Stop.

783
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:25,237
Your girlfriend's here.

784
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:27,498
Don't call her that.

785
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:34,316
I swear to God, I could kill 
 Dwayne and those poachers.

786
01:12:34,316 --> 01:12:36,685
Couldn't have been Dwayne. 
 He was busted...

787
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:40,556
dealing deer antlers to Fish and Game 
 agents an hour before he got jumped.

788
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:43,081
Grandpa had Gates question McCallum.

789
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:47,191
You wearing my jacket, he didn't 
 exactly love my Youth Center idea.

790
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:52,201
-What've you two been up to? 
 -We had been planning a big party.

791
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:55,003
-What's the occasion? 
 -It's your birthday.

792
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:59,508
-Finn is not ready for a party. 
 -No! I want a party!

793
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:02,773
Let's have a party! 
 Let's invite the guy who beat me up!

794
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:21,854
He didn't just do this to you, Finn.

795
01:13:22,364 --> 01:13:23,956
He did it to my family.

796
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:28,659
First my father gets shot, 
 now you get beaten up.

797
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,978
Maya will understand if you go back 
 to New York till we catch this guy.

798
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:39,014
I wanna be here when they get him.

799
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:42,609
-He could come after you again. 
 -Then I'll know who he is.

800
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:49,723
You're tougher than you look.

801
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:52,050
Come here.

802
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:07,168
This makes us more than friends. 
 Now don't tell anyone about this.

803
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:51,585
I missed you... so much.

804
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:56,149
Watch it. My ribs still hurt.

805
01:14:57,059 --> 01:15:00,262
-Does it hurt to kiss me? 
 -No, of course not.

806
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:01,593
Then why don't you?

807
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:04,657
I don't know. 
 My mother might come in.

808
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:11,639
What is it with you?

809
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:17,312
You never wanna kiss me. 
 We're never alone.

810
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:19,414
Why did you tell 
 everybody at your party...

811
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:23,407
that my mother and your grandfather 
 were old, old friends?

812
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:29,458
-They are old friends. 
 -She's your grandfather's masseuse.

813
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:31,927
Why couldn't you 
 tell people the truth?

814
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:34,329
Are you embarrassed 
 that I'm not rich?

815
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:37,457
ls the fact that I am rich 
 and you're not gonna be a problem?

816
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:42,004
-'Cause, Finn, if it is... 
 -What? You're gonna dump me?

817
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:45,741
You're gonna do that anyway! 
 It's a joke between us.

818
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:49,700
Sooner or later, you're gonna get bored 
 screwing the poor boy at the party.

819
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:54,577
Why do you hate me so much?

820
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:17,432
<i>''Dear dad...</i>

821
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:21,967
<i>you know the thing the Ishkanani say</i> 
 <i>about showing a heart to the village?</i>

822
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:26,179
<i>Well, that's the part that's</i> 
 <i>gonna be a problem for me.</i>

823
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:34,756
<i>If everybody knows what happened,</i> 
 <i>for the rest of my life it'd be:</i>

824
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:35,824
<i>''You know Finn Earl...</i>

825
01:16:35,824 --> 01:16:38,816
<i>the guy who got beat up</i> 
 <i>and dead-horsed by some guy?''</i>

826
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:43,865
<i>And no matter</i> 
 <i>how great things turned out...</i>

827
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:47,970
<i>even if I ended up marrying Maya and</i> 
 <i>I became a famous anthropologist...</i>

828
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:51,773
<i>people would always say: ''No question,</i> 
 <i>after Finn got it in the ass...</i>

829
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:53,866
<i>he really got his shit together.''</i>

830
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:02,272
Mr. Osborne thinks it's time 
 for you to get back to work.

831
01:18:07,115 --> 01:18:09,049
I'll wait for you downstairs.

832
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:54,459
Have a look at that.

833
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:01,032
She's really got a lot of pubic hair.

834
01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:04,399
That woman is my mother.

835
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:11,641
I'm serious.

836
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:15,548
That fella there...

837
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:19,012
he ran the telegraph company.

838
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:22,488
You know who took this Kodak moment?

839
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:24,783
No.

840
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:26,888
My father.

841
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:33,026
This? Blackmail. 
 Pure and simple.

842
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:37,873
My dad leveraged this guy 
 to get his telegraph company...

843
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:40,809
to get our little hardware store...

844
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:44,112
the contract to supply his company 
 with all the copper wire...

845
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:47,445
they were gonna string 
 across these great United States.

846
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:51,546
This dirty little picture...

847
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:56,082
brought us wealth, class...

848
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:58,550
and respectability.

849
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:02,388
Why are you showing me this?

850
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,496
<i>Ex malo bonum.</i>

851
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:07,695
Out of bad comes good.

852
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:12,634
That's what people like you and me 
 are put on this earth to prove.

853
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:17,173
What really happened to you?

854
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,138
What did my mom tell you?

855
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:22,781
She said you got beat up.

856
01:20:25,453 --> 01:20:27,580
Said she didn't want 
 to say anything more.

857
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:30,485
Neither do l.

858
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:52,912
-What's wrong with you? 
 -Fuck you!

859
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:55,015
Fuck you, too.

860
01:20:59,054 --> 01:21:01,784
I'm sorry, Jilly. 
 I didn't mean to...

861
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:04,284
What's wrong?

862
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:07,823
Dwayne knocked me up.

863
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:11,298
What are you gonna do?

864
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:16,237
Christ. I'm seventeen.

865
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:20,069
I can't even afford 
 to look after myself.

866
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:33,144
I know it's not much, 
 but will this help?

867
01:21:59,814 --> 01:22:01,111
What's wrong?

868
01:22:03,218 --> 01:22:05,118
I'm the one that's pregnant.

869
01:22:06,388 --> 01:22:09,755
That guy that beat me up 
 didn't just...

870
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:50,422
Finn!

871
01:22:56,905 --> 01:22:58,770
You are never...

872
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,268
Shit!

873
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:03,201
<i>Finn!</i>

874
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:06,605
Finn...

875
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:28,303
<i>If a prospective bridegroom</i> 
 <i>exhibits cowardice in battle...</i>

876
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:31,932
<i>the maidens will undergo</i> 
 <i>a ritual bath in the Orinoco.</i>

877
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:36,277
<i>Cleansed by the river spirits,</i> 
 <i>a new marriage will be arranged...</i>

878
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:38,438
<i>with an acceptable young warrior.</i>

879
01:23:56,564 --> 01:24:00,898
Now that you're not dragging us 
 to Finn's birthday party...

880
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:22,821
Whitney! Don't run away.

881
01:24:23,324 --> 01:24:24,518
Where you going?

882
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:43,203
Whitney!

883
01:24:47,482 --> 01:24:48,506
Whitney!

884
01:24:50,952 --> 01:24:51,976
Whitney!

885
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:10,661
Whitney, can I come in?

886
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:20,215
You were there 
 the night Finn got hurt.

887
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:22,945
Right? And...

888
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:26,381
you saw what happened, 
 you saw who did it, right?

889
01:25:33,328 --> 01:25:34,693
Who did this?

890
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:38,559
-Can you tell me? 
 -Gentleman and a scholar.

891
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:46,337
-What? 
 -Gentleman and a scholar.

892
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:50,868
Gentleman and a scholar. 
 Gentleman and a scholar.

893
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:56,644
-Miss Earl, sir. 
 -I have something to say to you.

894
01:25:58,753 --> 01:26:01,187
You said you wanted to know 
 what really happened with Finn.

895
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:03,986
What messed him up with Maya.

896
01:26:04,859 --> 01:26:08,693
Why don't you ask that sick, 
 twisted grandson of yours?

897
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:12,426
Are you telling me 
 Bryce beat up Finn?

898
01:26:13,768 --> 01:26:17,295
-He didn't just beat him up. 
 -What else did he do?

899
01:26:18,973 --> 01:26:21,168
I can't. 
 I promised Finn I wouldn't.

900
01:26:24,646 --> 01:26:26,443
Then you tell me what you know.

901
01:26:37,959 --> 01:26:39,722
Oh, Jesus...

902
01:26:42,063 --> 01:26:43,553
I don't think...

903
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,469
and I don't believe...

904
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:52,840
that my grandson...

905
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,774
is capable of...

906
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:07,645
If you value our friendship...

907
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:13,958
you won't ever bring up 
 this matter again.

908
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:17,896
What do I tell my son 
 about people like you?

909
01:27:36,484 --> 01:27:37,542
Maya!

910
01:27:38,987 --> 01:27:40,921
I need to talk to you.

911
01:27:41,356 --> 01:27:45,893
I can understand your grandfather 
 protecting the prick for screwing you.

912
01:27:45,893 --> 01:27:48,953
-But the maid? 
 -Maya, please.

913
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:51,524
Maya!

914
01:28:41,115 --> 01:28:44,243
Jesus Christ! 
 Bryce, what are you doing here?

915
01:28:44,752 --> 01:28:47,687
-What the hell are you doing here? 
 -I have a present for you.

916
01:28:47,922 --> 01:28:53,094
Check this out. 
 This is a real monkey skull.

917
01:28:53,094 --> 01:28:55,029
These are real quail feathers.

918
01:28:55,029 --> 01:28:58,795
The Ishkanani wear this 
 when they're feeling fucked up.

919
01:29:00,234 --> 01:29:03,670
Helps them see the spirit world. 
 Check it out.

920
01:29:06,574 --> 01:29:10,271
Yes, Finn, this is a happening look.

921
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:14,015
-You've gotta talk to her for me. 
 -Who?

922
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:16,584
-Maya. 
 -Oh, it'll blow over.

923
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:20,455
-You screwed the maid. So what? 
 -It's not like that. It's really not...

924
01:29:20,455 --> 01:29:23,151
Don't worry about Maya.

925
01:29:24,392 --> 01:29:28,692
I got something that is 
 gonna cheer you up.

926
01:29:29,397 --> 01:29:30,965
-Close your eyes. 
 -I'm not in the mood.

927
01:29:30,965 --> 01:29:36,028
Trust me, you will be. 
 Come on, close them.

928
01:29:39,741 --> 01:29:42,977
-What the hell is that? 
 -It's liquid acid.

929
01:29:42,977 --> 01:29:45,468
-Oh, shit! 
 -Relax.

930
01:29:46,514 --> 01:29:50,245
I don't think that's gonna help. 
 You don't wanna fight it.

931
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:52,982
This stuff will make you 
 see everything.

932
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:56,823
I'll catch you later then.

933
01:30:05,133 --> 01:30:07,468
<i>Children are sacred to the tribe.</i>

934
01:30:07,468 --> 01:30:10,671
<i>Their souls being more vulnerable</i> 
 <i>to the ''yamahiroterri''...</i>

935
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:13,141
<i>and the other spirits</i> 
 <i>of the underworld.</i>

936
01:30:13,141 --> 01:30:16,702
<i>Children are nurtured,</i> 
 <i>protected and loved.</i>

937
01:30:17,512 --> 01:30:21,215
<i>There is a special bond</i> 
 <i>between mother, father and child...</i>

938
01:30:21,215 --> 01:30:24,786
<i>that extends from this life</i> 
 <i>into the next.</i>

939
01:30:24,786 --> 01:30:28,278
<i>How many forest spirits do you have?</i>

940
01:30:29,023 --> 01:30:33,289
<i>The Shaman reminds our anthropologist</i> 
 <i>that there are three forests.</i>

941
01:30:33,728 --> 01:30:37,528
<i>The here and now,</i> 
 <i>the one we go to when we die...</i>

942
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:40,067
<i>and the forest beneath us.</i>

943
01:30:40,234 --> 01:30:43,004
<i>The underworld,</i> 
 <i>where evil spirits...</i>

944
01:30:43,004 --> 01:30:44,839
<i>wait for a chance to rise up...</i>

945
01:30:44,839 --> 01:30:47,603
<i>and steal the souls of our children.</i>

946
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:52,013
Think, Finn. 
 Think of Speed Racer...

947
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:55,107
and his struggle with Racer X.

948
01:30:56,317 --> 01:30:59,081
<i>Finn, listen to the Shaman.</i>

949
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:03,157
<i>He is asking you to remember</i> 
 <i>the myth of Racer X...</i>

950
01:31:03,157 --> 01:31:05,682
<i>Speed Racer's darker half-brother.</i>

951
01:31:07,995 --> 01:31:13,234
<i>The Shaman reminds your father</i> 
 <i>that the soul is always in jeopardy.</i>

952
01:31:13,234 --> 01:31:16,260
<i>The myth of the jaguar, how does that</i> 
 <i>connect to my son's sadness?</i>

953
01:31:22,176 --> 01:31:23,734
<i>Can you speak to him for me?</i>

954
01:31:24,445 --> 01:31:25,776
<i>Tell him I love him?</i>

955
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:30,485
<i>Marriage is for life.</i>

956
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:33,120
<i>Our concepts of separation,</i> 
 <i>divorce...</i>

957
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,523
<i>remarriage, and a second family...</i>

958
01:31:35,523 --> 01:31:37,658
<i>are unthinkable to the Ishkanani.</i>

959
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:41,958
The good and the bad 
 are within you, Finn.

960
01:31:51,639 --> 01:31:54,540
<i>Finn, listen to the Shaman.</i>

961
01:31:55,443 --> 01:31:57,812
Your nureshi is waiting to see...

962
01:31:57,812 --> 01:32:01,908
how you fight this battle 
 inside yourself.

963
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:07,518
<i>He is saying your nureshi</i> 
 <i>has not deserted you.</i>

964
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:19,423
Grandpa?

965
01:32:22,537 --> 01:32:23,663
What do you think?

966
01:32:27,441 --> 01:32:29,644
You care about people, Bryce?

967
01:32:29,644 --> 01:32:30,668
Yes.

968
01:32:32,013 --> 01:32:33,378
That's what this is about.

969
01:32:34,315 --> 01:32:37,648
I don't mean do you care 
 what they think about you.

970
01:32:39,253 --> 01:32:41,956
Do you care about 
 what happens to them?

971
01:32:41,956 --> 01:32:46,827
I'm sorry, Grandpa, I'm confused. 
 Did you take your medicine today?

972
01:32:46,827 --> 01:32:50,388
Don't fool with me, boy. 
 I can eat you for breakfast.

973
01:32:54,535 --> 01:32:56,298
You and I both know...

974
01:32:58,005 --> 01:33:00,337
that your father wasn't hit...

975
01:33:01,442 --> 01:33:03,501
by some stray bullet, don't we?

976
01:33:13,187 --> 01:33:14,415
Why Finn?

977
01:33:16,724 --> 01:33:18,817
Why did you do that to Finn?

978
01:33:28,903 --> 01:33:30,996
You gave him my place 
 in your balloon.

979
01:33:36,243 --> 01:33:37,938
That's my place, Grandpa.

980
01:33:39,213 --> 01:33:42,580
That's mine. It's not his. 
 I'm your grandson.

981
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:46,450
He doesn't even belong here.

982
01:33:47,088 --> 01:33:50,491
Two thousand years ago, I would've done 
 that in front of the whole village.

983
01:33:50,491 --> 01:33:51,822
They would've clapped.

984
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:01,029
You made a mess of everything.

985
01:34:07,008 --> 01:34:08,407
Get out of my sight.

986
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:15,047
Get that thing out of my sight.

987
01:34:20,021 --> 01:34:21,249
Go on, get!

988
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:27,256
All turned to shit.

989
01:34:29,296 --> 01:34:30,888
You disgust me.

990
01:34:39,173 --> 01:34:40,197
I said...

991
01:34:54,889 --> 01:34:56,857
<i>No!</i>

992
01:34:56,857 --> 01:34:59,927
Grandpa won't wake up! 
 Somebody!

993
01:34:59,927 --> 01:35:01,554
Grandpa won't wake up!

994
01:35:25,853 --> 01:35:28,720
<i>The family is having</i> 
 <i>people over for a wake.</i>

995
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:32,715
-They didn't invite us. 
 -I'm inviting you.

996
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:39,433
-We're leaving. 
 -What do you mean, we're leaving?

997
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:41,902
I'm not staying here 
 a moment longer.

998
01:35:41,902 --> 01:35:44,837
What happened between you two? 
 He loved you.

999
01:35:49,076 --> 01:35:52,713
You know what? You don't 
 wanna go, that's up to you...

1000
01:35:52,713 --> 01:35:55,807
but I'm going, 'cause he 
 was a good friend to me.

1001
01:36:04,391 --> 01:36:07,628
<i>Just make me</i>

1002
01:36:07,628 --> 01:36:11,565
<i>Make me a pallet on the floor</i>

1003
01:36:11,565 --> 01:36:13,968
<i>Just make me</i>

1004
01:36:13,968 --> 01:36:17,927
<i>-Make me a pallet on the floor</i> 
 -It's Creamsicle.

1005
01:36:18,539 --> 01:36:22,843
<i>And if you make me a pallet</i>

1006
01:36:22,843 --> 01:36:25,613
<i>On your floor</i>

1007
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:30,141
<i>And it's because, I swear...</i>

1008
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:34,388
When this is all over, 
 we'll get him.

1009
01:36:34,388 --> 01:36:41,123
<i>That you made me a pallet</i>

1010
01:36:56,744 --> 01:36:58,979
-Who is that? 
 -A pair of tits.

1011
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:03,780
Put the pictures down. 
 Get your hands off the pictures!

1012
01:37:04,685 --> 01:37:05,743
Okay.

1013
01:37:19,767 --> 01:37:24,805
Grandpa always said you had what it 
 takes to end up with the most toys.

1014
01:37:24,805 --> 01:37:26,670
What is that supposed to mean?

1015
01:37:29,777 --> 01:37:32,143
He also said 
 you couldn't trust happiness.

1016
01:37:33,614 --> 01:37:34,842
Or was it money?

1017
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:38,375
I don't know. 
 I can't remember.

1018
01:37:40,788 --> 01:37:44,417
Maya, I'm really sorry 
 about everything.

1019
01:37:49,797 --> 01:37:52,061
-You wanna see my tattoo? 
 -Sure.

1020
01:37:58,739 --> 01:38:01,640
I did it with a razor blade 
 and charcoal.

1021
01:38:02,743 --> 01:38:04,768
Sorry I left off the second ''N''...

1022
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:07,342
but I passed out 
 before I could finish it.

1023
01:38:10,918 --> 01:38:15,582
-It's ''Fin''. It means ''the end''. 
 -I know what it means.

1024
01:38:16,423 --> 01:38:20,018
-Young love. 
 -What is that shit?

1025
01:38:20,361 --> 01:38:22,090
It's Grandpa's ashes.

1026
01:38:22,363 --> 01:38:25,499
-He hasn't even been cremated yet. 
 -I know.

1027
01:38:25,499 --> 01:38:27,194
Finn knows what I mean, right?

1028
01:38:27,801 --> 01:38:29,826
Isn't that called ''endokenblu''?

1029
01:38:32,273 --> 01:38:33,570
Freak.

1030
01:38:39,613 --> 01:38:42,810
What's with her? 
 Trouble in paradise?

1031
01:38:46,387 --> 01:38:48,582
Here. Fire me up.

1032
01:39:08,575 --> 01:39:09,769
Cool lighter, huh?

1033
01:39:14,915 --> 01:39:17,679
Keep it. You've earned it.

1034
01:39:55,122 --> 01:39:58,057
Hey, Lambie. 
 Looking for me?

1035
01:39:58,659 --> 01:40:00,490
You were supposed 
 to use that on yourself.

1036
01:40:01,528 --> 01:40:05,966
That night on the field, I just had 
 to know what it would feel like.

1037
01:40:05,966 --> 01:40:07,434
Stop moving.

1038
01:40:07,434 --> 01:40:10,904
Everyone wonders what it would 
 feel like to do whatever they want...

1039
01:40:10,904 --> 01:40:12,633
to take whatever they want.

1040
01:40:12,873 --> 01:40:15,175
I followed that urge 
 to the end of the road.

1041
01:40:15,175 --> 01:40:17,006
I own my own hunger.

1042
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:22,049
-Can you say the same? 
 -You are such a sick fuck.

1043
01:40:22,049 --> 01:40:23,141
Come on.

1044
01:40:25,786 --> 01:40:26,844
Come on.

1045
01:40:29,957 --> 01:40:31,049
Do it!

1046
01:40:38,065 --> 01:40:39,089
Do it.

1047
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:49,509
Where you going, Lambie?

1048
01:40:50,377 --> 01:40:51,469
Where you going?

1049
01:41:09,797 --> 01:41:10,889
Marco?

1050
01:41:13,767 --> 01:41:15,064
Marco?

1051
01:41:16,837 --> 01:41:18,600
You're supposed to say Polo, Finn.

1052
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:25,735
After your funeral, I'll fuck 
 your mother like I fucked you.

1053
01:42:28,175 --> 01:42:29,642
Christ!

1054
01:42:31,512 --> 01:42:32,672
That hurts!

1055
01:42:36,717 --> 01:42:37,741
No!

1056
01:42:39,386 --> 01:42:42,378
-No, Finn! 
 -Shut up!

1057
01:42:44,091 --> 01:42:45,581
You fuck!

1058
01:42:52,666 --> 01:42:54,327
Welcome to the tribe, brother.

1059
01:43:46,653 --> 01:43:48,822
What are you doing? 
 That's not our car.

1060
01:43:48,822 --> 01:43:50,190
It is now.

1061
01:43:50,190 --> 01:43:52,215
I'm taking it as severance pay.

1062
01:43:53,927 --> 01:43:55,519
Oh, God. Now what?

1063
01:44:05,772 --> 01:44:07,296
I'll see if we left anything.

1064
01:44:07,975 --> 01:44:11,545
-Hi. 
 -I can't stay long.

1065
01:44:11,545 --> 01:44:14,412
They're shipping me off to some 
 boarding school in Switzerland.

1066
01:44:17,017 --> 01:44:18,245
Can I write you?

1067
01:44:21,421 --> 01:44:23,013
Gates just told us what happened.

1068
01:44:24,825 --> 01:44:25,849
I didn't...

1069
01:44:28,729 --> 01:44:31,755
I didn't know about my brother.

1070
01:44:32,966 --> 01:44:35,127
I mean, about anything. 
 It seems like...

1071
01:44:36,036 --> 01:44:40,340
My whole life I've never really 
 known a thing. I'm really sorry.

1072
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:41,398
It's okay.

1073
01:44:45,612 --> 01:44:48,274
Finn, I'm so sorry.

1074
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:50,774
I'm not.

1075
01:44:51,885 --> 01:44:53,250
I got to meet you.

1076
01:44:57,824 --> 01:44:59,121
You better write me.

1077
01:45:01,428 --> 01:45:02,486
Definitely.

1078
01:45:03,797 --> 01:45:04,889
Definitely.

1079
01:45:07,768 --> 01:45:10,566
This was on my grandpa's desk. 
 I was supposed to give it to you.

1080
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:16,970
I'm gonna miss you.

1081
01:45:48,909 --> 01:45:53,903
<i>'''Ex malo bonum.'</i> 
 <i>Out of bad comes good.</i>

1082

1083
01:46:11,064 --> 01:46:13,532

1084
01:46:13,834 --> 01:46:15,734
<i>he'd moved on to a different tribe.</i>

1085
01:46:17,037 --> 01:46:19,106
<i>I too had moved on, I guess.</i>

1086
01:46:19,106 --> 01:46:22,337

1087
01:46:27,013 --> 01:46:28,708
<i>But I did learn this much.</i>

1088
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:33,918
