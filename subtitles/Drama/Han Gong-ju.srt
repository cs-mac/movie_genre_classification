00:01:57,256 --> 00:02:00,765
<i>[The Virtuous Queen of Han]</i>


3
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:03,468
<i>[Episode Thirty]</i>


4
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:08,974
Since the Empress left the palace,
signs of rainfall keep appearing.


5
00:02:08,974 --> 00:02:11,284
It is enough to prove that
in the Empress' absence


6
00:02:11,294 --> 00:02:13,205
the wind and rain would come.


7
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:19,475
<i>The Empress arrives!</i>


8
00:02:19,475 --> 00:02:22,844
Happiness and peace to the Empress!


9
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,882
Great blessings to Your Majesty.


10
00:02:34,882 --> 00:02:35,882
You may all rise.


11
00:02:35,882 --> 00:02:38,005
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty!


12
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:39,956
Since Empress is already here


13
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:42,967
I shall see if it is as
King of Huainan said.


14
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:47,108
That with Empress on the platform,
rain will not fall.


15
00:02:47,108 --> 00:02:50,108
I ask that Your Highness leave the
platform as soon as possible


16
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:52,858
for the sake of the people and nation.


17
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:56,552
I've already pleaded with the gods
to soon bless us with rainfall.


18
00:02:56,552 --> 00:03:00,324
Should Empress' presence infuriate
the gods and cease the rainfall


19
00:03:00,324 --> 00:03:02,322
wouldn't that cause more
suffering to the people?


20
00:03:02,322 --> 00:03:04,205
How could Your Highness bear to do so?


21
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:06,876
- Yes, exactly.
- Please leave, Your Highness.


22
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:08,843
Your Highness, please leave now.


23
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:10,668
Your Highness, please leave now.


24
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:12,758
- Please leave now.
- Leave now.


25
00:03:23,506 --> 00:03:25,388
If my departure would
bring rain and wind


26
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:27,316
I would retreat to the
other side of the world.


27
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:32,368
If sacrificing my life would bring
rain to my suffering people


28
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:34,114
I wouldn't dare stay living.


29
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:37,014
But the climate cannot
be changed by a ritual.


30
00:03:37,014 --> 00:03:39,625
I am of the imperial family.


31
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:43,875
I will not allow anyone to confuse
the public with superstition.


32
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,566
If rain is to fall,
how could it be ceased by me?


33
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:48,323
If rain is not to fall


34
00:03:48,323 --> 00:03:50,825
how could it be changed by
King of Huainan?


35
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:55,401
Today, the gods will be our witnesses.


36
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,264
We shall see who is
right and who is wrong.


37
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:09,037
May the gods bless my
people of Great Han


38
00:04:09,037 --> 00:04:11,462
not to be swayed by superstitions.


39
00:04:11,462 --> 00:04:14,750
I'm willing to share the worries
and joys here with the people.


40
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,502
I will wait here for rainfall
to nourish my people.


41
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:49,072
Empress holds the umbrella
to pray to the gods


42
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:51,764
for rainfall to nourish the people!


43
00:04:51,764 --> 00:04:55,331
I ask that Your Highness
leave the platform quickly


44
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:57,060
so that I may plead to Tai Yi again...


45
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,069
Empress holds the umbrella
to pray to the gods


46
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:01,348
for rainfall to nourish the people!


47
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:03,216
Leave now! Don't stay here!


48
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:05,059
Shut up!
Empress is praying for rain!


49
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:06,879
- Leave now!
- Leave!


50
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:10,191
Whether it rains or not


51
00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:15,349
I will be be your god
and watch over you.


52
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,737
Emperor and Empress are of one mind!


53
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:23,254
Their kindness will bless the people!


54
00:05:23,254 --> 00:05:26,268
Emperor and Empress are of one mind!
Their kindness will bless the people!


55
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:29,188
Emperor and Empress are of one mind!
Their kindness will bless the people!


56
00:05:29,188 --> 00:05:32,154
Emperor and Empress are of one mind!
Their kindness will bless the people!


57
00:05:32,154 --> 00:05:37,429
Emperor and Empress are of one mind!
Their kindness will bless the people!


58
00:05:37,429 --> 00:05:40,357
Emperor and Empress are of one mind!
Their kindness will bless the people!


59
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:43,907
Gods!
Please don't rain yet.


60
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:46,708
Rain after the Empress leaves.


61
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,674
Help my Jiao Er, gods!


62
00:05:49,674 --> 00:05:52,806
Emperor and Empress are of one mind!
Their kindness will bless the people!


63
00:05:52,806 --> 00:05:55,746
Emperor and Empress are of one mind!
Their kindness will bless the people!


64
00:05:55,746 --> 00:05:58,945
Emperor and Empress are of one mind!
Their kindness will bless the people!


65
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:02,499
- It's raining!
- It's raining!


66
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:07,556
- It's raining!
- It's raining!


67
00:06:07,556 --> 00:06:10,148
- Prayers for rain are answered!
- Gods bestowed rain upon us!


68
00:06:10,148 --> 00:06:11,653
We owe this to the Empress!


69
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:12,667
Yes!


70
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,073
Thank you, gods!


71
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:23,427
God of sun, Tai Yi,
took pity on us!


72
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:26,294
Empress prayed for rain!


73
00:06:26,294 --> 00:06:28,667
Gods bestowed rain upon us!


74
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:31,010
Empress holds the umbrella and
gods bestowed rain upon us!


75
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,708
It is finally raining!


76
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,659
- It is raining!
- This is great!


77
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:41,400
This is great!


78
00:06:55,386 --> 00:06:57,083
The rain came just in time.


79
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,246
If it keeps on raining,
the drought is sure to be relieved.


80
00:07:00,246 --> 00:07:02,104
Great Han is truly blessed.


81
00:07:02,104 --> 00:07:05,559
What was important was that
Sister made it in time to the platform


82
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:06,943
and broke the rumor of the jinx.


83
00:07:06,943 --> 00:07:09,068
King of Huainan is really cunning.


84
00:07:09,068 --> 00:07:13,087
When it started raining, he immediately
knelt down to thank the gods.


85
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:14,128
Exactly.


86
00:07:14,128 --> 00:07:16,665
It was as if he was the one
who got the rain to fall.


87
00:07:16,665 --> 00:07:19,943
What an act he put on.
His Majesty will never let him off.


88
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,683
Xi Niang, now that you are
the general's mother-in-law


89
00:07:23,683 --> 00:07:25,785
you've definitely changed.
You're so insightful now.


90
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:27,534
How could I be compared to you?


91
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:29,035
You're suddenly so knowledgeable.


92
00:07:29,035 --> 00:07:31,321
You understand everything,
from astronomy to geography.


93
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:34,034
You could tell it was going to rain
just by watching the ants move.


94
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:36,405
Such remarkable foresight!


95
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:39,688
I think you're praising me,
but why do you sound so sarcastic?


96
00:07:39,688 --> 00:07:41,513
Are you so unwilling
to give me credit?


97
00:07:41,513 --> 00:07:44,201
We really owe it to Uncle Yi.


98
00:07:44,201 --> 00:07:45,977
If it hadn't been for Uncle Yi


99
00:07:45,977 --> 00:07:47,996
Liu An would have gotten
away with his scheme.


100
00:07:47,996 --> 00:07:49,746
Not only would the Empress be the jinx


101
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:52,720
but the reputation of His Majesty
would also be damaged.


102
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,717
Sister is vindicated again.
It was all Uncle Yi's doing.


103
00:07:56,717 --> 00:07:59,794
Vindication came because
of the Empress' kindness.


104
00:07:59,794 --> 00:08:02,484
The gods are aware of her virtue.


105
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:04,215
We owe it to Uncle Yi's quick wit


106
00:08:04,215 --> 00:08:06,999
for challenging Liu An with
his own conflicting theories.


107
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:10,270
You made use of his 'Pattern of Heaven'
to allow the people to see the truth


108
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,842
and not be swayed by superstition.


109
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:13,878
Stop praising me.


110
00:08:13,878 --> 00:08:14,989
Actually...


111
00:08:14,989 --> 00:08:16,891
Actually we all deserve credit for this.


112
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:18,292
How could he take all the credit?


113
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:21,068
Wei Qing should take credit
for stalling Liu An's ritual.


114
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:25,833
Master Duan escorted the Empress to the
ritual platform in the nick of time.


115
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,039
And His Majesty is wise and decisive.


116
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:29,688
I reported to him
that it would soon rain


117
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:32,059
and His Majesty immediately made
all the right arrangements.


118
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,748
That's how Liu An failed.
How delightful!


119
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:34,808
Don't forget me!


120
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:37,133
You? Why do you deserve any credit?


121
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,976
Jia Er and I kept yelling
to boost the morale.


122
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,088
We were the ones who
started the chants.


123
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,781
We were yelling at the
top of our lungs!


124
00:08:42,781 --> 00:08:44,528
We even got all
the people to yell with us.


125
00:08:45,532 --> 00:08:47,667
Wei Qing, don't you think that
we deserve some credit?


126
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:50,104
All right, all of you deserve
some credit for it.


127
00:08:50,104 --> 00:08:51,932
His Majesty will definitely
keep it in mind.


128
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:56,374
Your Highness, Bai Min is here to report
that His Majesty summons you.


129
00:09:02,691 --> 00:09:03,691
<i>[Feichang Palace]</i>


130
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:05,263
Your Majesty, Her Highness is here.


131
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:09,446
Great blessings to Your Majesty.


132
00:09:09,446 --> 00:09:11,868
Greetings to Your Majesty.


133
00:09:13,028 --> 00:09:14,028
You may all rise.


134
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,656
You've been aggrieved.


135
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:24,481
With the wise arrangements
of Your Majesty


136
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,975
and the assistance of everyone


137
00:09:25,975 --> 00:09:28,608
not only have I upheld my reputation


138
00:09:28,608 --> 00:09:30,939
but the people are also
unswayed by superstition.


139
00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:33,745
I do not feel aggrieved.


140
00:09:33,745 --> 00:09:38,634
Duan Hong, Wei Qing. I shall reward
the both of you well for your credit.


141
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:41,249
I wouldn't dare take credit for it.


142
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:45,973
Your Majesty, the one who deserves
the most credit is Uncle Yi.


143
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:48,878
Yi Han has indeed
performed exceptionally.


144
00:09:48,878 --> 00:09:52,528
If you hadn't discovered the
moving of the insects in time


145
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:54,061
and the changes in
the winds and clouds


146
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,080
Empress would have had
gained a bad reputation


147
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,645
and the dignity of the imperial
family would have been at risk.


148
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:00,277
I am but a civilian.


149
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:03,229
I just happened to know
some common knowledge.


150
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:05,350
It allows me to spot signs of rainfall


151
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,385
and the affection between
Your Majesty and Your Highness.


152
00:10:09,385 --> 00:10:11,312
It's rare that you don't
take credit for this.


153
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:15,249
Is it common knowledge to have read


154
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:18,249
'Gan and Shi's Celestial Book'
and 'Pattern of Heaven'?


155
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:23,358
You may just be a cook,
but you are well-educated and profound.


156
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:26,033
Your Majesty, I was only putting
what I learned to use.


157
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:27,986
I am not profound.


158
00:10:27,986 --> 00:10:29,186
You do not have to be modest.


159
00:10:30,469 --> 00:10:33,825
None of the court officials
are as good as this cook.


160
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:36,189
It seems that you aren't simply a cook.


161
00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:37,915
I wish to reward wise men.


162
00:10:37,915 --> 00:10:40,335
But the more I think about this,
the more confused I get.


163
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:43,212
Since such a wise man has stayed by
the Empress' side for so many years


164
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:44,610
why didn't you assist me as well?


165
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,177
Could it be that I am foolish...


166
00:10:47,077 --> 00:10:51,014
or that I am not virtuous enough
to get your assistance?


167
00:10:51,014 --> 00:10:52,729
Your Majesty, I am but a...


168
00:10:52,729 --> 00:10:54,321
Stop it.


169
00:10:57,538 --> 00:11:00,773
There are only two kinds of people
who are not employed by the emperor.


170
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:03,821
One is a prisoner who fled
from his punishments.


171
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:07,561
And the other is an enemy
who has conspiracies in his heart.


172
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:10,937
Tell me now.
Which one are you?


173
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,461
What is your intention,
hiding in the palace for years?


174
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,580
Yi Han, answer me!


175
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:23,665
Are you a fugitive or my enemy?


176
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,955
I am not your enemy.
I am a sinner.


177
00:11:40,135 --> 00:11:41,135
Sinner?


178
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:42,849
I have sinned deeply.


179
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:44,753
I am ashamed to use my real name.


180
00:11:44,753 --> 00:11:47,110
Not to mention rendering my
services to the imperial court.


181
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,052
How have you sinned?


182
00:11:49,052 --> 00:11:50,960
I met my mentor when I was young


183
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,960
and inherited his knowledge
of medicine, divination


184
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,094
astronomy, geography,
and all sorts of other things.


185
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:57,840
But I was to be blamed for
my own arrogance.


186
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,516
I was over-confident in my intelligence
and the favor of my mentor


187
00:12:00,516 --> 00:12:03,166
so I challenged my senior to a
contest of sorcery and divination.


188
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,364
Although I defeated my senior


189
00:12:04,364 --> 00:12:08,382
my mentor was then resented
and executed by my senior.


190
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:11,074
His skills weren't as good as yours,
so he murdered out of jealousy.


191
00:12:11,074 --> 00:12:14,089
Didn't the local officials
do anything about it?


192
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:16,026
I wouldn't dare to lie to Your Majesty.


193
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,531
Although my senior was later
sentenced to death for his actions


194
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:21,070
my mentor still died because of me.


195
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,522
Therefore, I swore to myself
that I'd conceal my identity


196
00:12:24,522 --> 00:12:27,627
and stand aloof from worldly affairs.


197
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:34,106
I burned myself and use the
pain as a constant reminder.


198
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:39,831
Your Majesty, I am willing to
vouch for Yi Han's character.


199
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:42,657
I met Uncle Yi when I was just a child.


200
00:12:42,657 --> 00:12:44,403
He gave to me the teaching


201
00:12:44,403 --> 00:12:46,403
'don't fight, don't stand out,
don't show.'


202
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:52,749
Since then, I've lead my life and
treated others with that lesson.


203
00:12:55,742 --> 00:13:00,374
'Don't fight, don't stand out,
don't show.'


204
00:13:00,374 --> 00:13:02,935
It is indeed how Empress has
conducted herself.


205
00:13:02,935 --> 00:13:09,610
So Empress can lead the harem in
harmony because of Yi Han's lesson?


206
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,106
I wouldn't dare take credit for that.


207
00:13:11,106 --> 00:13:12,865
Her Highness is kind and
generous by nature.


208
00:13:12,865 --> 00:13:13,979
She needs no reminder.


209
00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:15,978
These are just words of
modesty from the Empress


210
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:17,478
to show her respect for the elders.


211
00:13:17,478 --> 00:13:21,887
Your Majesty, Uncle Yi not only
taught me the ways of life


212
00:13:21,887 --> 00:13:23,995
but I also know deep in my heart


213
00:13:23,995 --> 00:13:27,104
that I was favored by Your Majesty
because of Uncle Yi's assistance.


214
00:13:29,777 --> 00:13:31,620
That year after the flood,
food was scarce.


215
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,471
Empress was still a child then,
but she shared her bread with me.


216
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:36,747
<i>She saved my life.</i>


217
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:39,608
<i>Her natural inclination to
self sacrifice was impressive.</i>


218
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:41,071
<i>Years later, when we met again</i>


219
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,430
<i>Her Highness was as modest
and generous as she used to be.</i>


220
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,603
She was even more virtuous.


221
00:13:44,603 --> 00:13:46,844
Your Majesty happened to visit
the Pingyang Manor then.


222
00:13:46,844 --> 00:13:52,389
I saw that Your Majesty had
the look of affection so...


223
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:56,146
So you used the seed of a fruit


224
00:13:56,146 --> 00:13:58,624
<i>to help highlight me
before His Majesty's eyes.</i>


225
00:14:04,898 --> 00:14:08,144
The fruit could be of assistance only to
one who would sacrifice to help others.


226
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:10,009
It helped show your virtue
before His Majesty.


227
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:13,840
It was because I feel deeply for
Her Highness' virtue.


228
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,643
If she can stay by Your Majesty's side


229
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:17,406
it will be a great
blessing to the people.


230
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:19,425
When I had wanted to
leave the palace for good


231
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,124
<i>Uncle Yi gave me an accessory.</i>


232
00:14:21,124 --> 00:14:24,308
<i>That was to make His Majesty
notice me and keep me with him.</i>


233
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:29,668
Your Majesty, Yi Han not only
assisted the Empress


234
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,921
but also taught me much
about commanding armies.


235
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:34,778
I went to the battle in
the western regions


236
00:14:34,781 --> 00:14:37,326
armed with Uncle Yi's knowledge
of the local conditions.


237
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:39,446
Yi Han deserves credit for that as well.


238
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:42,562
You just said that you wanted to
stand aloof from worldly affairs.


239
00:14:42,562 --> 00:14:44,628
Why have you stayed
in the palace for so many years?


240
00:14:45,617 --> 00:14:48,984
Years ago, Yi Han was the head chef
at Pingyang Manor.


241
00:14:48,984 --> 00:14:52,003
Princess recommended him to the
palace to be of assistance to my sister.


242
00:14:52,003 --> 00:14:55,599
It was not Yi Han's intention
to stay in the palace.


243
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:57,633
Your Majesty, the Empress ran
into great obstacles


244
00:14:57,633 --> 00:14:59,133
in her first few years in the harem.


245
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:02,317
I believe that Yi Han chose to stay on
in order to protect Her Highness.


246
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:08,061
Your Majesty, I dare to guarantee that
he never seeks to take any credit


247
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:09,927
for taking care of me all these years.


248
00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:12,383
- Not to mention any desire for fame...
- That is enough.


249
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,210
Speak up for yourself.


250
00:15:16,142 --> 00:15:19,537
This is all because it was
my destiny to meet the Empress.


251
00:15:19,537 --> 00:15:23,600
I stayed to repay her
kindness for saving my life.


252
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,936
Her Highness is the role model for all


253
00:15:25,936 --> 00:15:28,988
and I thought that I could finally
retire to return to my hometown.


254
00:15:28,988 --> 00:15:33,008
But then Her Highness was framed by
villains to stain her reputation.


255
00:15:33,008 --> 00:15:35,768
I had no choice but to go against
my oath and approach the platform.


256
00:15:37,845 --> 00:15:41,065
Your Majesty, although Yi Han
concealed his identity


257
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,269
I can guarantee that he
is loyal to Your Majesty.


258
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:46,845
It was Yi Han who spotted
King of Huainan's scheme


259
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,409
and exposed his lies on the platform.


260
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:51,345
Without him, it would have been hard
to clear Her Highness of a bad name.


261
00:15:51,345 --> 00:15:55,558
Yi Han does indeed deserve credit
for having anticipated the outcome.


262
00:15:55,558 --> 00:15:57,532
Since you know well of
astronomy and geography


263
00:15:57,532 --> 00:16:00,552
I will appoint you as the Grand Scribe.


264
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:02,557
Thank you, Your Majesty.


265
00:16:02,557 --> 00:16:06,178
But I had only hoped for Her Highness
to be free from false accusations


266
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:08,460
and that the people would not
be swayed by superstition.


267
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,137
That would ease my guilt of
having broken my oath.


268
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,678
As a sinner, I'm ashamed
to be awarded a title.


269
00:16:13,678 --> 00:16:20,117
I beg Your Majesty to allow me to stay
as a cook to atone for my sins.


270
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:22,159
Since you do not want to
be appointed as an official


271
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:27,292
I will reward you with a manor so
that you may live and work in peace.


272
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:29,022
Thank you, Your Majesty.


273
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,032
I am deeply grateful.


274
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:35,755
But Her Highness, General Wei,
and Master Duan


275
00:16:35,755 --> 00:16:38,396
treat me as their family.


276
00:16:38,396 --> 00:16:43,306
How could a manor be as good as
being together with my family?


277
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:47,662
All right, I'll bestow you
an imperial entry permit.


278
00:16:47,662 --> 00:16:50,502
In addition to Jiaofang Palace


279
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:54,699
I hereby order Wei Qing and Duan Hong
to set up your quarters in their manors.


280
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:57,151
So that you may stay
at their homes at will.


281
00:16:57,151 --> 00:16:59,465
- I'll obey the orders.
- I'll obey the orders.


282
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:01,601
Your Majesty, thank you
for being so understanding.


283
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,727
I will also award you with one
thousand taels of gold.


284
00:17:04,727 --> 00:17:07,751
Your Majesty, Yi Han is not
one who seeks benefits.


285
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:10,981
I bow to thank Your Majesty
for your rewards.


286
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,668
I am not after the rewards


287
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:17,697
but disasters have struck and
the people are in difficulties.


288
00:17:17,697 --> 00:17:20,786
I plan to use the rewards given to me to
help those who are alone and in need.


289
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:21,972
Please allow me to do so.


290
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:27,080
- Get up now.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.


291
00:17:28,653 --> 00:17:30,571
I didn't expect you to
have such kind thoughts.


292
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:32,371
I shall bestow the title
of 'Elder' to you.


293
00:17:32,371 --> 00:17:35,311
I will also reward you with a carriage
that carries the flag of goodwill.


294
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:38,071
It should come with a crossbar to
indicate that you're meritorious.


295
00:17:38,071 --> 00:17:44,309
You shall drive the carriage of goodwill
to relieve the people of the disaster.


296
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:48,434
I thank Your Majesty on behalf
of the people for your kindness.


297
00:17:49,506 --> 00:17:52,561
Those who offer comfort to the
people will all be rewarded.


298
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:58,225
But those who create trouble and confuse
the people will not be let off easily.


299
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:16,694
Your Majesty, I have brought you
Liu An, King of Huainan.


300
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,123
Sinner Liu An asks
Your Majesty for forgiveness.


301
00:18:25,203 --> 00:18:26,230
You ask for forgiveness.


302
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:28,685
You left your territories
without permission


303
00:18:28,685 --> 00:18:30,403
and confused the people
with superstitions.


304
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:33,102
You've slandered the Empress
and stirred up a commotion.


305
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:35,158
Which sin are you
pleading for forgiveness?


306
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:40,432
I am confident of my
knowledge in Daoism


307
00:18:40,432 --> 00:18:42,218
and know a bit about astronomy.


308
00:18:42,218 --> 00:18:45,069
My deceased mentor spoke
to me in my dreams


309
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:49,741
to save the people from suffering.


310
00:18:49,741 --> 00:18:51,741
In response, and with haste,
I made a huge mistake.


311
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:55,543
This heavy rain is just
like a timely warning.


312
00:18:55,543 --> 00:18:59,399
I know that I have sinned greatly!


313
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:01,695
You have indeed sinned greatly!


314
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:04,898
It is enough to take your life!


315
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:06,418
Your Highness is kind and generous.


316
00:19:06,418 --> 00:19:08,282
King of Huainan might have sinned


317
00:19:08,282 --> 00:19:10,573
but it was all for the
sake of the people!


318
00:19:10,573 --> 00:19:13,283
I beg Your Highness to sentence
him to a lighter penalty!


319
00:19:13,283 --> 00:19:16,370
I do not dare to agree with
the Chancellor's opinion.


320
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,427
Should everyone use the people
as an excuse to break the laws


321
00:19:19,427 --> 00:19:21,003
what good are the laws and regulations?


322
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:22,766
King of Huainan has
committed a deadly crime.


323
00:19:22,766 --> 00:19:25,501
How are we to discipline the
officials if we let him off lightly?


324
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:29,288
Your Majesty, I've practiced
Daoism and wrote books


325
00:19:29,288 --> 00:19:31,735
in order to seek the best
interests for the people.


326
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:33,465
Since I left Huainan


327
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,609
I came to the capital on my
own to plead for rainfall.


328
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:38,655
Although I had no intention of treason


329
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:41,389
I do have the intention
to die for my deeds.


330
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:44,837
Fortunately, the gods bestowed rain
upon us all and the people are saved.


331
00:19:44,837 --> 00:19:48,367
Your Majesty's and the Empress'
reputation are further glorified.


332
00:19:48,377 --> 00:19:51,782
I have no regrets.


333
00:19:51,782 --> 00:19:54,477
I am willing to accept
the death penalty.


334
00:19:55,858 --> 00:19:58,791
All right! Since you've confessed to
your crime and accepted the penalty


335
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,757
I will grant you your wish!


336
00:20:00,757 --> 00:20:02,596
- Guards!
- Hold it!


337
00:20:02,596 --> 00:20:05,038
Your Majesty, Meng Tzu once said


338
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,513
that the people come before the
nation and before the ruler.


339
00:20:07,513 --> 00:20:09,089
I might be a man of military training


340
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:10,928
but I have also had tuition
since I was young.


341
00:20:10,928 --> 00:20:13,477
I know that even as officials,
we have to put the people first.


342
00:20:13,477 --> 00:20:15,948
Although King of Huainan did not
follow the laws of the nation


343
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,834
and offended the Emperor and Empress,
the people still owe him gratitude.


344
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:20,360
I hope Your Majesty will reconsider.


345
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,980
Master Duan misuses the words of
the saints to cover up the sins.


346
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,204
It is ridiculous.


347
00:20:24,204 --> 00:20:26,892
The people comes first and therefore
they must be protected by laws.


348
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,445
If we make an exception for
not punishing the wrongdoer


349
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:33,951
there will be more cases of wrongdoings
that will cause the people more harm!


350
00:20:33,951 --> 00:20:35,868
My father often said that
to err is to be human.


351
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:38,561
It is also acceptable to make up
for one's sins with one's merits.


352
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:40,675
King of Huainan has always been
known to be virtuous.


353
00:20:40,675 --> 00:20:42,928
His many kind deeds to protect
the people are documented.


354
00:20:42,928 --> 00:20:45,166
It should be enough to make
up for one reckless mistake.


355
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:48,424
Your Majesty, King of Huainan
once pledged with his own life.


356
00:20:48,424 --> 00:20:50,549
It is evident how much he
cares about the people!


357
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,598
Moreover, King of Huainan is
already of an old age.


358
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:55,112
He traveled alone to the capital
and is now exhausted and weak.


359
00:20:55,112 --> 00:20:57,528
It is said that the old and
the young shouldn't be punished.


360
00:20:57,528 --> 00:20:59,518
I beg Your Majesty to spare
him of his punishment.


361
00:20:59,518 --> 00:21:01,842
The old and the young should
not be punished, indeed.


362
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:06,962
King of Huainan Liu An left
his territories unauthorized.


363
00:21:06,962 --> 00:21:10,419
He confused the people and
slandered the Empress.


364
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:12,981
He deserves to be slain for his sins.


365
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:16,565
But in regards to his concern for
the people, I'll spare him his life.


366
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:18,683
I command him to leave
the capital immediately!


367
00:21:18,683 --> 00:21:21,611
Thank you, Your Majesty!


368
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:25,455
In regards to Liu An's old age,
he is unfit to travel long distances.


369
00:21:25,455 --> 00:21:28,782
I shall bestow to him the cane of
turtle-doves as an elderly


370
00:21:28,782 --> 00:21:32,394
to retire in peace in Huainan.


371
00:21:32,394 --> 00:21:34,776
He will no longer need to be here
in court to seek audience.


372
00:21:34,776 --> 00:21:37,727
Thank you, Your Majesty!


373
00:21:54,176 --> 00:21:56,148
My King, your carriage is ready.


374
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,101
You may embark on your journey.


375
00:21:58,101 --> 00:22:01,311
His Majesty said that I do not need
to seek audience with him anymore


376
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:05,007
but the truth is that he forbids me
to enter the capital again.


377
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:10,153
I might never have the chance
to be in these walls again.


378
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:12,016
Master Duan, please excuse me.


379
00:22:12,016 --> 00:22:16,165
Allow me to look at
Chang An for a bit longer.


380
00:22:16,165 --> 00:22:17,929
My King is a man of sentiments.


381
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:23,102
Master Duan spoke up for me
without any fear of His Majesty.


382
00:22:23,102 --> 00:22:24,748
You are the one with great sentiments.


383
00:22:24,748 --> 00:22:27,641
Master Duan spoke boldly
in defense of justice.


384
00:22:27,641 --> 00:22:30,375
Please accept this bow of mine.


385
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:33,794
Please get up, My King.
I don't deserve this.


386
00:22:33,794 --> 00:22:36,539
Actually, I stood up for
you not for justice


387
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:39,092
but for my own
personal interests.


388
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:42,280
Master Duan, feel free to
tell me what it is about.


389
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,318
May I ask how that
amber beast came about?


390
00:22:46,318 --> 00:22:50,192
Master Duan is referring to this?


391
00:22:50,192 --> 00:22:51,872
This accessory looks familiar to me.


392
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:55,017
My father once had a similar accessory.


393
00:22:55,017 --> 00:22:59,076
What? Could it be that I have
met your father before?


394
00:22:59,076 --> 00:23:01,486
It's a pity that I am leaving soon


395
00:23:01,486 --> 00:23:03,740
and won't be able to pay
your father a visit.


396
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,446
When I was young, I was separated from
my father when we fled from a disaster.


397
00:23:07,446 --> 00:23:09,863
I have hoped to reunite with my father.


398
00:23:09,863 --> 00:23:11,925
My King, do you remember that
many years ago


399
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:16,851
you saved a man who gave that to
you to thank you for saving his life?


400
00:23:16,851 --> 00:23:20,670
That man is about my age.


401
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,734
Now that I think about it, he does have
the same surname as Master Duan.


402
00:23:23,734 --> 00:23:26,576
He came from...


403
00:23:26,576 --> 00:23:28,009
Is it Pingyang County?


404
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:29,788
It is indeed Pingyang County.


405
00:23:29,788 --> 00:23:31,526
This is truly a linked destiny.


406
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:35,273
Many years later, this accessory
is given back to his son.


407
00:23:35,273 --> 00:23:41,096
It seems that by fate, I was
to come to Chang An for you.


408
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:45,388
May I ask where my father is now?


409
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:50,225
Back then, he was severely poisoned
and on the verge of death.


410
00:23:50,225 --> 00:23:52,932
Fortunately, My King tried all
sorts of antidotes on him


411
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,003
and made him a remedy
with tofu to treat him.


412
00:23:56,003 --> 00:23:59,069
I've heard of King of Huainan's
filial affection.


413
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:00,664
You made food remedies for your mother.


414
00:24:00,664 --> 00:24:03,258
Who knew that my father had the
honor of trying it for himself


415
00:24:03,284 --> 00:24:04,382
and was even cured?


416
00:24:04,382 --> 00:24:06,980
Unfortunately, right after he recovered


417
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,207
he left this behind and left.


418
00:24:09,207 --> 00:24:12,359
I have no idea where he is now.


419
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:18,071
I remember that your father once
said that he would live in Huainan.


420
00:24:19,796 --> 00:24:20,796
Master Duan!


421
00:24:20,796 --> 00:24:22,357
My King is my father's savior.


422
00:24:22,357 --> 00:24:23,503
You deserve my salute.


423
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,879
Since my father is in Huainan


424
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:28,123
I beg My King to help me search for
my father so that we may reunite.


425
00:24:28,123 --> 00:24:29,515
Please get up.


426
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:32,870
Master Duan, please rest assured.


427
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,926
I will definitely do my best
to search for your father.


428
00:24:35,926 --> 00:24:40,084
Duan Hong will never forget
King of Huainan's kindness.


429
00:24:40,084 --> 00:24:42,801
Master Duan's filial affection
has moved the gods.


430
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:47,290
As long as I shall live,
I will fulfill your wish.


431
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,978
I'm afraid that after
I've returned to my territories


432
00:24:50,978 --> 00:24:52,978
I might not even be able
to fend for myself.


433
00:24:52,978 --> 00:24:56,150
I might let you down.


434
00:24:58,062 --> 00:24:59,469
Why would My King say that?


435
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,328
The favors of the Emperor
are unpredictable.


436
00:25:03,328 --> 00:25:07,326
Now that His Majesty doubts me


437
00:25:07,326 --> 00:25:12,785
he bestowed this copper cane
to ban me from the capital.


438
00:25:12,785 --> 00:25:16,559
Who knows if he might one day bestow
poisonous wine to me to kill me?


439
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:22,894
By then, in order to prove
my loyalty to His Majesty


440
00:25:22,894 --> 00:25:26,853
I can only give in and
wait for death to take me.


441
00:25:29,115 --> 00:25:30,516
My King cares about the people


442
00:25:30,516 --> 00:25:33,340
but you came to the capital
for them without permission.


443
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,271
Hence, His Majesty misunderstood you.


444
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,469
Although My King never means to
go against His Majesty


445
00:25:39,469 --> 00:25:42,294
one way to protect yourself
is to have your own army.


446
00:25:42,294 --> 00:25:46,673
Master Duan, why have you said so?


447
00:25:46,673 --> 00:25:48,584
The imperial court plans
to promote enfeoffment.


448
00:25:48,584 --> 00:25:50,685
The title of the feudal king
and lands will no longer


449
00:25:50,685 --> 00:25:51,967
be inherited by first born sons.


450
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,023
Feudal kings are allowed to leave
their lands to other children as well.


451
00:25:55,869 --> 00:25:57,619
It might be called enfeoffment


452
00:25:57,619 --> 00:26:00,606
but the effect of it is to weaken
the feudal kings by taking their lands.


453
00:26:00,606 --> 00:26:03,766
Master Duan, thank you for the heads up.


454
00:26:05,804 --> 00:26:06,996
I have spoken too much.


455
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,040
<i>A Prefect of the
Gentlemen-of-the-Palace</i>


456
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,141
<i>who is said to be the
Emperor's favorite official</i>


457
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:25,583
is actually so foolish!


458
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,779
My King used but a few words,
and he was already deceived.


459
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:30,448
How difficult could it be?


460
00:26:30,448 --> 00:26:34,756
It is gods' blessings that I met him.


461
00:26:34,756 --> 00:26:40,637
A small accessory is actually
identical to one his father had.


462
00:26:42,192 --> 00:26:45,951
I just went along and made up the
story of how I met his father.


463
00:26:45,951 --> 00:26:49,572
Kinship is always
difficult to get rid of.


464
00:26:49,572 --> 00:26:54,053
Moreover, he was separated
from his father for years.


465
00:26:54,053 --> 00:26:58,391
When it came to kinship,
he let his guard down.


466
00:26:58,391 --> 00:27:01,704
He would believe anything I said.


467
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,032
He sees My King as his savior.


468
00:27:03,032 --> 00:27:05,437
He even revealed the new policy
to weaken the feudal states.


469
00:27:05,437 --> 00:27:07,966
I said that his father is in Huainan


470
00:27:07,966 --> 00:27:10,908
so he will naturally come
to warm up to me in the future.


471
00:27:10,908 --> 00:27:12,828
He is the Prefect of the
Gentlemen-of-the-Palace.


472
00:27:12,828 --> 00:27:16,740
He holds the great power of
safeguarding Chang An.


473
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:22,388
It will be of great use to
stay friends with this person.


474
00:27:22,388 --> 00:27:24,026
My King is wise.


475
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:30,862
Do good for the sake of the people?


476
00:27:30,862 --> 00:27:33,135
He actually had other plans in mind.


477
00:27:33,135 --> 00:27:35,289
If he truly is virtuous


478
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:38,403
why would he try to
win you over right away


479
00:27:38,403 --> 00:27:40,403
when you mentioned the accessory?


480
00:27:40,403 --> 00:27:42,292
I was born in poverty.


481
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:44,437
Why would my father possess
such a valuable belonging?


482
00:27:44,437 --> 00:27:45,896
He was so eager to win over my favor


483
00:27:45,896 --> 00:27:48,838
that he didn't even think twice before
establishing a connection with me.


484
00:27:48,838 --> 00:27:50,812
It seems that Liu An came
to the capital alone


485
00:27:50,812 --> 00:27:54,115
to slander the Empress for
his own conspiracies.


486
00:27:54,115 --> 00:27:56,505
He didn't just plan these recently.


487
00:27:56,505 --> 00:27:59,079
Once all these events were put together


488
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:01,711
I couldn't help but think that
Guan Fu and Chancellor Dou


489
00:28:01,711 --> 00:28:04,222
were referring to King of Huainan
when they said that Tian Fen


490
00:28:04,248 --> 00:28:06,415
had conspired with someone
to go against Your Majesty.


491
00:28:06,415 --> 00:28:07,535
I thought that as well.


492
00:28:08,743 --> 00:28:10,719
Therefore, I had no choice
but to let him go free.


493
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:16,821
I'm afraid he may have conspired with
others of power in the name of virtue.


494
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:20,417
Moreover, his brothers and
sons are all still in Huainan.


495
00:28:21,821 --> 00:28:24,076
Who knows how many soldiers
and provisions they now own?


496
00:28:24,076 --> 00:28:26,768
Now that the drought subsided and
there are enemies at the frontier


497
00:28:26,794 --> 00:28:27,848
Wei Qing will go to war.


498
00:28:27,848 --> 00:28:30,656
If the feudal kings act up now,
we could be in danger.


499
00:28:30,656 --> 00:28:33,342
Your Majesty had no choice but
to use this delaying tactic.


500
00:28:33,342 --> 00:28:36,606
I hope that releasing him
will turn him into our bait


501
00:28:36,608 --> 00:28:40,003
and we can lure out all
of his partners in crime.


502
00:28:41,128 --> 00:28:44,013
I'll wait patiently for the right
moment to wipe them all out!


503
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,665
Otherwise Your Majesty could have
him die a thousand times over


504
00:28:46,665 --> 00:28:49,665
with any one of the
crimes he committed.


505
00:28:49,665 --> 00:28:52,540
It's been hard on you to
put on this act with me.


506
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,667
You pretended to be
friendly with Liu An.


507
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:58,936
I'm afraid that you might be
misunderstood as ganging up with rebels.


508
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:03,655
I would risk it all to rid
the nation of villains


509
00:29:03,655 --> 00:29:05,655
and seek revenge on
Guan Fu and Chancellor Dou!


510
00:29:24,025 --> 00:29:25,305
It is so tiring to take a trip.


511
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,344
I even had to give out bag after bag
of rice to the victims of the disaster.


512
00:29:28,344 --> 00:29:31,302
If My Lady finds it too tiring,
you should have stayed in the manor.


513
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,436
You don't need to be out
there doing such hard work.


514
00:29:33,436 --> 00:29:35,762
Fortunately, this satin outfit
of yours isn't stained.


515
00:29:35,762 --> 00:29:37,929
I couldn't afford to
pay the compensation.


516
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:39,291
My son-in-law has gone to war


517
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,334
so I definitely have to be out
doing charitable work


518
00:29:41,334 --> 00:29:43,144
to get some blessings to
pray for his safety.


519
00:29:43,144 --> 00:29:45,823
In that case,
work harder next time.


520
00:29:48,877 --> 00:29:51,759
That jade bracelet is quite nice!
You could give that to the victims...


521
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:54,036
This was bestowed to me
by Empress Dowager!


522
00:29:54,036 --> 00:29:55,663
It must not be sold or given to another.


523
00:29:55,663 --> 00:29:58,196
I couldn't bear to be
punished for disrespect.


524
00:30:00,013 --> 00:30:01,378
Then those earrings...


525
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:04,219
Jia Er gave these to me!


526
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,466
What about that hairpin?


527
00:30:05,466 --> 00:30:07,579
What would victims of the
disaster want hairpins for?


528
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:08,735
They can't have it as food.


529
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:13,318
If you can't bear to part with anything,
how can you do charity work?


530
00:30:13,318 --> 00:30:15,663
Even if there are blessings,
I'm afraid you won't get them!


531
00:30:16,802 --> 00:30:18,565
Just now, those victims kept saying


532
00:30:18,565 --> 00:30:21,284
Thank you, My Lady.
Warm blessings, My Lady.


533
00:30:21,284 --> 00:30:24,781
Yes, yes. My Lady doesn't
usually do charitable work


534
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,907
but now that you do,
you're blessed with offspring!


535
00:30:27,907 --> 00:30:29,054
Knock on wood!


536
00:30:29,054 --> 00:30:30,638
How could I be blessed with offspring?


537
00:30:30,638 --> 00:30:33,390
Don't assume that you can say such
nonsense because you're an Elder.


538
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,538
What are you thinking?


539
00:30:35,538 --> 00:30:38,940
I am saying that your daughter,
Jia Er, is carrying a child.


540
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,082
Anyone can tell that my
daughter is carrying a child!


541
00:30:41,082 --> 00:30:43,555
Her stomach is already so big!
Do I need you to tell me that?


542
00:30:43,555 --> 00:30:48,718
But do you know if she is
expecting a son or a daughter?


543
00:30:48,718 --> 00:30:50,256
You know how to foretell that as well?


544
00:30:50,256 --> 00:30:52,435
Is it a son or a daughter?
Tell me!


545
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:53,746
- A boy...
- It's a boy?


546
00:30:53,746 --> 00:30:56,110
Or a girl is equally joyous.


547
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,353
Is that so important?


548
00:30:57,353 --> 00:30:58,493
You're teasing me!


549
00:30:58,493 --> 00:31:00,744
Go on and tell me
if it's a son or a daughter!


550
00:31:00,744 --> 00:31:01,992
I won't let this go!
Tell me!


551
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:04,033
She's given birth, My Lady!


552
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:06,724
She gave birth when she
went to visit the Empress!


553
00:31:06,724 --> 00:31:07,850
Is it a boy or a girl?


554
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,936
It's a boy!
Both mother and son are well.


555
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:13,168
The gods have truly blessed us!


556
00:31:13,168 --> 00:31:15,109
Charitable families are
bound to have great joy!


557
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:16,668
- This is great!
- Great! Great...


558
00:31:25,242 --> 00:31:27,659
Your Highness, if you aren't
satisfied with this jade loop


559
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:29,703
I will be sure to make
alterations to it right away


560
00:31:29,703 --> 00:31:32,253
so that Your Highness can take it
with you to Chang An in time.


561
00:31:32,253 --> 00:31:33,936
It is fine.


562
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:37,984
This just needs to be polished
a bit more so that it shines.


563
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,984
Yes.


564
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:40,888
<i>General Wei has returned!</i>


565
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,616
The army of Great Han has won again!


566
00:31:45,605 --> 00:31:47,829
This is great!
This is such wonderful news!


567
00:31:47,829 --> 00:31:52,136
Indeed. General Wei is valiant
and skilled in warfare.


568
00:31:52,136 --> 00:31:54,482
On his way back to Chang An


569
00:31:54,482 --> 00:31:58,485
there must be people who are
cheering for him along the way.


570
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:10,879
Great Han has gained great
victory in war again!


571
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:12,763
This is truly an occasion
to be celebrated!


572
00:32:12,763 --> 00:32:15,263
Tonight, before the banquet for
all officials and marquesses


573
00:32:15,263 --> 00:32:17,580
I wish to gather with my family first.


574
00:32:19,128 --> 00:32:20,128
Wei Qing!


575
00:32:21,551 --> 00:32:22,551
Present!


576
00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:23,971
Our enemies are at bay.


577
00:32:23,971 --> 00:32:25,612
You deserve the most credit for it.


578
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:27,886
Your sister and your wife are
both very proud of you.


579
00:32:27,886 --> 00:32:32,604
I will award you the title of
Marquess of Changping in front of them.


580
00:32:39,646 --> 00:32:40,878
Thank you, Your Majesty.


581
00:32:40,878 --> 00:32:43,559
I will definitely do my best
to serve Your Majesty.


582
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:44,871
Good!


583
00:32:46,224 --> 00:32:48,668
There are two joyous events for
the household of General Wei.


584
00:32:48,668 --> 00:32:50,019
Your child was just born.


585
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:51,449
Have you named him yet?


586
00:32:51,449 --> 00:32:53,920
Your Highness, we have yet to name him.


587
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,753
This is Wei Qing's first child.


588
00:32:55,753 --> 00:32:59,692
I will give him a good name.


589
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,543
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.


590
00:33:03,151 --> 00:33:06,239
What about... 'Kang'?


591
00:33:08,885 --> 00:33:11,669
'Kang' stands for unyielding will,
courage, and righteousness.


592
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:13,989
Your Majesty, thank you
for blessing this child.


593
00:33:13,989 --> 00:33:15,598
It also means to be of a great match.


594
00:33:15,598 --> 00:33:18,044
It refers to the affection of his parents.


595
00:33:18,044 --> 00:33:19,743
Both meanings of 'Kang' are good.


596
00:33:19,743 --> 00:33:21,591
The child shall be named Wei Kang.


597
00:33:21,591 --> 00:33:23,033
Do you have any objections?


598
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:26,066
Wei Kang is a very good name.
Thank you for naming him, Your Majesty!


599
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:27,795
Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty.


600
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:35,095
Your Majesty, the Marquess of Ruyin
seeks audience.


601
00:33:35,095 --> 00:33:36,966
- Summon him.
- Yes.


602
00:33:46,142 --> 00:33:48,711
Marquess of Ruyin, Xia Hou Po,
greets Your Majesty.


603
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:49,937
Don't stand on ceremony!


604
00:33:49,937 --> 00:33:51,639
The national banquet is yet to begin.


605
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:55,189
Marquess of Ruyin has
arrived very early.


606
00:33:55,189 --> 00:33:57,271
I know that Your Majesty is
having a family gathering


607
00:33:57,271 --> 00:33:58,786
so I especially came over in advance.


608
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:02,764
I am here to greet Empress Dowager
and all the relatives.


609
00:34:04,327 --> 00:34:08,286
I heard that General Wei
was valiant and skilled in warfare.


610
00:34:08,286 --> 00:34:10,303
You have gained victory
once again for the nation.


611
00:34:10,303 --> 00:34:13,493
I hereby congratulate General Wei
on your victorious return.


612
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:18,511
Your Majesty, Ruyin might be small


613
00:34:18,511 --> 00:34:20,962
but I hope to contribute to the nation.


614
00:34:20,962 --> 00:34:26,484
I wish to donate Ruyin's annual profits
to serve as the army's provisions.


615
00:34:26,484 --> 00:34:30,250
The profits of the territories are
originally the salary of the marquesses.


616
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:34,466
It is rare of you to offer your salary
besides the time for tributes.


617
00:34:34,466 --> 00:34:39,122
When the army of Great Han wins again,
I am sure to give you some credit.


618
00:34:39,122 --> 00:34:41,459
I didn't do this for rewards.


619
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:43,881
I only ask that...


620
00:34:46,825 --> 00:34:48,357
I may say a few words to the Princess.


621
00:34:54,104 --> 00:34:55,104
Go ahead.


622
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,837
I heard that Your Highness has been
searching for a good mentor


623
00:34:57,837 --> 00:34:59,337
for the young marquess.


624
00:35:00,563 --> 00:35:02,181
There is a talented
man of both literary


625
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:04,314
and military skills in Ruyin
by the name of Sang Yi.


626
00:35:04,314 --> 00:35:07,096
Sang Yi is known for
his kindness and virtue.


627
00:35:07,096 --> 00:35:09,614
When the Emperor was just born


628
00:35:09,614 --> 00:35:13,207
your father had wanted to invite
him over to be your tutor.


629
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:15,653
I have heard Mother mention him before.


630
00:35:15,653 --> 00:35:17,605
But this man does not seek any
titles or rewards.


631
00:35:17,605 --> 00:35:20,209
He would rather retire to the
countryside and cultivate himself.


632
00:35:20,209 --> 00:35:23,676
Even though royalties went to beg him


633
00:35:23,676 --> 00:35:26,002
he refused to leave the
mountains to teach them.


634
00:35:26,002 --> 00:35:30,310
I've already convinced this great man
to tutor the young marquess


635
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,310
in Pingyang County.


636
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:36,948
Princess can be at ease and no
longer worry for the young marquess.


637
00:35:36,948 --> 00:35:41,642
She won't have to travel between
Chang An and Pingyang so often.


638
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:43,571
This is such a great gift.


639
00:35:43,571 --> 00:35:45,937
Of all the tributes that kings
and marquesses have given


640
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:48,729
none is as precious
and valuable as yours.


641
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,904
Your Highness, may I be
so bold as to ask you


642
00:35:51,904 --> 00:35:55,417
that if I use this gift as
a betrothal gift


643
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:57,549
is it of appropriate sincerity?


644
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,692
I have admired Princess for a long time.


645
00:36:03,692 --> 00:36:05,859
I am willing to protect and
follow her until the end.


646
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:11,480
I beg Empress Dowager to
grant me permission.


647
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,297
I beg Your Majesty to grant me my wish
and bestow this marriage to me.


648
00:36:17,455 --> 00:36:20,089
Marquess of Ruyin is not only
concerned about the national affairs


649
00:36:20,089 --> 00:36:22,303
but also willing to share the
burdens of the Princess.


650
00:36:22,303 --> 00:36:24,468
I have no objection to this marriage.


651
00:36:24,468 --> 00:36:27,015
But even as the ruler of a nation


652
00:36:27,015 --> 00:36:29,877
my sister's marriage must be
decided by my sister herself.


653
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:34,535
I wonder what Your Highness
thinks of this marriage?


654
00:37:16,354 --> 00:37:17,948
I ask that Your Majesty consent to it.


655
00:37:19,881 --> 00:37:20,881
You have my consent.


656
00:37:35,058 --> 00:37:37,631
Sister, why have you asked me over?


657
00:37:38,741 --> 00:37:40,102
Have a seat.


658
00:37:44,935 --> 00:37:48,207
I asked you over to try some of
Uncle Yi's grilled meats.


659
00:37:48,207 --> 00:37:52,288
Uncle Yi will be going down south on
his carriage of goodwill tomorrow.


660
00:37:52,288 --> 00:37:55,098
He won't return to Chang An
for quite some time.


661
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:58,667
I still remember years ago
when I was accused of murder


662
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:00,814
and imprisoned in Lateral Courts.


663
00:38:00,814 --> 00:38:04,317
Princess had wanted to please
Empress Dowager


664
00:38:04,317 --> 00:38:07,317
with Uncle Yi's grilled meats,
in order to save me.


665
00:38:07,317 --> 00:38:11,649
Princess has never backed down,
even if she was implicated


666
00:38:11,649 --> 00:38:14,649
from trying to save
the both of us.


667
00:38:14,649 --> 00:38:20,100
Today, Princess will leave Chang An
to be married to the faraway Ruyin.


668
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,464
She is marrying so well.


669
00:38:21,464 --> 00:38:23,788
We should be happy for her.


670
00:38:29,212 --> 00:38:33,198
Princess is getting married but
you feel reluctant, don't you?


671
00:38:33,198 --> 00:38:36,178
No, why would I?


672
00:38:36,178 --> 00:38:39,263
I'm truly happy for her that
she has found a great husband.


673
00:38:39,263 --> 00:38:41,225
Marquess of Ruyin comes
from a prestigious family.


674
00:38:41,225 --> 00:38:43,316
His lands are rich
and he is well-educated.


675
00:38:43,316 --> 00:38:45,011
He is a good match for Princess.


676
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:50,727
Empress Dowager was right, after all.


677
00:38:50,727 --> 00:38:51,935
Empress Dowager?


678
00:38:51,935 --> 00:38:54,930
She had asked about you and Princess?


679
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:58,562
At that time, there were widespread
rumors about me and Princess.


680
00:38:59,568 --> 00:39:02,654
Empress Dowager summoned me into the
palace and listed all the consequences.


681
00:39:05,658 --> 00:39:09,446
Now, it seems worthwhile.


682
00:39:09,446 --> 00:39:13,254
Otherwise, Princess would have been
accused of supporting her familiars


683
00:39:13,254 --> 00:39:17,033
to gain authority in and out of
the palace for conspiracies.


684
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:20,330
You would also be reproached by others.


685
00:39:21,933 --> 00:39:23,163
It must be difficult for you.


686
00:39:23,163 --> 00:39:26,009
But can you really let it go?


687
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:31,405
At the time, I really couldn't...


688
00:39:32,873 --> 00:39:34,332
But now I am at ease.


689
00:39:36,102 --> 00:39:38,057
However, Princess has a tough character.


690
00:39:38,057 --> 00:39:39,468
Should she learn of the truth


691
00:39:39,468 --> 00:39:42,308
I'm afraid that she would bear
grudges against Empress Dowager.


692
00:39:42,308 --> 00:39:44,147
Don't worry, my brother.


693
00:39:44,147 --> 00:39:47,069
This matter is only known to us.


694
00:39:47,069 --> 00:39:50,303
I will never say a word about this.


695
00:39:50,303 --> 00:39:54,589
Marquess entrusted Princess
and young marquess to me.


696
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:57,435
Not only is the Princess blissful now


697
00:39:57,435 --> 00:39:59,678
but the young marquess has
also gained a great tutor.


698
00:39:59,678 --> 00:40:03,462
Now I can finally be relieved.


699
00:40:04,406 --> 00:40:08,220
You think of only the commitment,
but what of yourself?


700
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:13,812
More than anything,
I want to know if you are happy.


701
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:15,328
Please don't worry.


702
00:40:15,328 --> 00:40:19,187
Jia Er and I are getting
along very well.


703
00:40:19,187 --> 00:40:21,183
That's good then.


704
00:40:21,183 --> 00:40:28,102
I only hope that Princess and her
husband can support one another


705
00:40:28,102 --> 00:40:31,560
through life's ups and downs,
in both joy and bitterness, like we do.


706
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,823
That lowly stable boy thinks
that he can defeat me?


707
00:41:47,823 --> 00:41:51,471
Look who's got the lady in the end?


708
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:53,772
My mission is then accomplished.


709
00:41:53,772 --> 00:41:58,602
If anyone should learn that I was the
one who told you to spread the rumors


710
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:04,691
in order to overthrow the emperor...


711
00:42:04,691 --> 00:42:06,089
How would I dare to tell anyone?


712
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:12,334
If your tongue is too loose
and stirs up great trouble


713
00:42:12,334 --> 00:42:16,439
I will definitely take
all your rewards back.


714
00:42:16,439 --> 00:42:19,518
And then punish you heavily.


715
00:42:19,518 --> 00:42:21,749
I understand.


716
00:42:21,749 --> 00:42:23,654
- Leave now.
- Yes.
