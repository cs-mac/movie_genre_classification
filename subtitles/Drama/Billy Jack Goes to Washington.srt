00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,675
<i>Pat o'brien: The picture
you're about to</i> see

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,135
<i>is dedicated as
a loving tribute</i>

3
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,138
<i>to that special breed
of human being who,</i>

4
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,141
<i>from the beginning, has been
the backbone and wonder</i>

5
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,352
<i>of that spirit that was
to become the American dream.</i>

6
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:23,815
<i>The individual who would
stand up and fight</i>

7
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,150
for what
he believes is right,

8
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,319
<i>no matter how overwhelming
the odds.</i>

9
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:45,170
<i>The story takes place
in our nation's capital,</i>

10
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,297
<i>when certain isolated groups
of people</i>

11
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,632
<i>were beginning to ask
for a freeze on the building</i>

12
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,260
<i>of nuclear plants,
and the stockpiling</i>

13
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,221
<i>of nuclear weapons.</i>

14
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:59,016
<i>About six months before
our story begins,</i>

15
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,644
<i>congress had appointed a
committee under the chairmanship</i>

16
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,855
<i>of senator Sam foley...</i>

17
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:07,108
<i>To investigate the allegations
of these groups,</i>

18
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,236
<i>that through campaign
contributions</i>

19
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:12,364
<i>and lucrative construction
contracts,</i>

20
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,075
<i>the nuclear industry had
actually gained control</i>

21
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,702
<i>over the nuclear regulatory
commission,</i>

22
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:21,123
<i>and the governmental agencies
that were supposed to police it.</i>

23
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,710
<i>As our picture opens,
senator foley,</i>

24
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,587
<i>after months
of closed sessions,</i>

25
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:31,425
<i>without warning,
abruptly cancels the hearing,</i>

26
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,386
<i>and, in an unusual move,</i>

27
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,305
<i>mysteriously seals
all the information</i>

28
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,850
<i>uncovered during
the investigation</i>

29
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,019
<i>as "classified top secret."</i>

30
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,981
<i>And then quietly
gives the green light</i>

31
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:49,359
<i>for the continued development
of nuclear plants</i>

32
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,819
<i>and nuclear weapons.</i>

33
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,948
Well, i-- I'll take your
questions one at a time,

34
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,908
- to make it manageable.
- Senator, I've been hearing

35
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,576
that you didn't actually
want these hearings cancelled.

36
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,161
Is there someone who's been
ordering these

37
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:00,996
hearings canceled?

38
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:04,416
You know better that that, Joe.

39
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,335
With so many deaths that
have been reported, the public--

40
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,003
that's true.

41
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,087
...beginning to suspect
a cover-up.

42
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,380
Senator, if your committee,
which is supposed to police

43
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,759
nuclear safety, is cancelled,
who gonna do the policing?

44
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,179
L-- my announcement stands.

45
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:20,473
Now, I see no point
in any further responses.

46
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,565
No more questions.

47
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,442
Is something wrong, sir?

48
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:32,735
He's sick.

49
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,947
- Get a doctor here!
- Please, clear the aisles.

50
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,740
I'm gonna call a doctor.

51
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,747
Give me
the urgent desk, please.

52
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,754
- Pardon me. Pardon me.
- Are you senator foley's aide?

53
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:52,672
She is.

54
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,925
Okay. Here's his briefcase
and all his papers.

55
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,677
- Oh. I'll give 'em to her.
- Okay, thank you.

56
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,181
- I'm gonna go call his wife.
- Okay, honey. Be right there.

57
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:09,356
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
- I'll get it. That's all right.

58
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,358
- I'm really sorry.
- I know that.

59
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,942
Bye-bye.

60
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,494
Yes, operator. I want to make
a person-to-person call

61
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,915
to governor Hubert hopper,
and bill it to my office number.

62
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,709
This is senator Joseph Payne.

63
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,506
Hello.

64
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,757
You're kidding.

65
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,093
I know it couldn't have come
at a worse time.

66
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,637
Call Bailey, tell him
I'm taking the next flight home.

67
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,181
What is it, Hubert?

68
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:15,185
Sam foley died.

69
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,523
Thank you.

70
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,483
I don't even
understand the question.

71
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:23,693
Just go back and tell them--

72
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,194
I don't even know what
they want from me anymore.

73
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:29,365
Do you have foley's nuclear
file? That's all I'm asking.

74
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,080
I tell you on Saturday
they come after you.

75
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,331
Try to take an afternoon off,

76
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,041
can't even play
a game of tennis.

77
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,168
What was that all about?

78
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:44,668
Well, some clown from the
justice department.

79
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,091
He's asking me if I've
got any of that material

80
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,844
that foley's committee had
on the nuclear contracts.

81
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,512
- Do you?
<i>'</i> No!

82
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,223
I don't know what ever
happened to any of that stuff.

83
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,391
I do.

84
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,185
What?

85
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,104
I have it.

86
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,274
What?

87
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:07,027
That, honey, is our ticket up.

88
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,822
Dan, are you crazy?

89
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,074
Come on, we need a fourth.

90
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,367
Great idea!

91
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,536
Come on,
it's only your husband.

92
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,955
You've been here all day.

93
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,039
- Come on.
- Please.

94
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,373
Let's go.
Come on, you need it.

95
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,500
Come on, come on, come on.

96
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,459
I'm coming.
I'm up, I'm up.

97
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,710
Don't forget your racquet.

98
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,088
Hey, I'll tell you
about it later, ok?

99
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,298
I love you.

100
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,683
Mcghan, go in there
and tell Bailey

101
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,352
that I've got to
give them an answer.

102
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,603
Why don't you tell him, hubie?

103
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,354
I mean after all,
it's your office.

104
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,274
All right,

105
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,528
all right, I will.

106
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:55,447
My concern is with this willet
creek nuclear plant on the fire.

107
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,705
Well, what's wrong with it?
It's ready to roll, isn't it?

108
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,123
Oh, yeah,
it's attached as a rider

109
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,624
where no one will notice it.

110
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,916
Then what are you
worried about?

111
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,585
Nothing, unless the man
we appoint as senator

112
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,963
begins to ask questions.

113
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,715
I mean, unless you're
absolutely sure of him.

114
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,551
It might be better
to postpone the nuclear plant

115
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,136
until the next session
of congress.

116
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,389
No, Joe, it's just not
possible to postpone.

117
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,724
Now we'll just have to appoint
somebody we can trust.

118
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,811
Now, wait a minute,
someone we can trust?

119
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,312
Well, who did you think
we'd appoint,

120
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,897
the chairperson
of a feminist league?

121
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,400
Well, there you go again, Jim.

122
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,152
Is that all you're ever
concerned about is Washington?

123
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,821
Don't you guys ever
think about my problems

124
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,988
down here in the state?

125
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,573
You're panicking, Hubert!

126
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,450
In my judgment,
the simplest thing to do

127
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,494
is to slip this thing through
just the way it's going

128
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,663
and get it over with,
don't you agree Joe?

129
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,581
Absolutely.
But we have to be sure

130
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,333
the man we pick will go along.

131
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,918
Judge Miller.

132
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,922
Miller? Oh, for god's sakes,
come on, will ya?

133
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,257
Horace Miller.
It's a good idea.

134
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,926
I mean, he was a reliable guy
before we put him on the bench,

135
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,678
he's a reliable guy
now that he's on the bench.

136
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,929
Now, what have you got
against him, hubie?

137
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,765
I mean he's exactly
what you want.

138
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:02,143
He's got class, dignity, he's
always kept his skirts clean.

139
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,103
You forgot one
little thing Jim.

140
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:08,604
Those people out there won't
stand for it, not for a minute!

141
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,110
We've given you your man.
Just make the announcement.

142
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,535
I won't do it.

143
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,038
Look, I can't just go out there
and give them an ultimatum.

144
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,665
I've got to make them feel
like they have a voice!

145
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,962
How about if we work for some
Harmony here, gentlemen, huh?

146
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:34,463
What do you say?
A little Harmony?

147
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:38,345
Horace Miller.

148
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,439
Billy Jack?

149
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,524
A half-breed Indian nut?

150
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,860
An ex-convict.
He's not even eligible.

151
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,238
He is now. I've already
granted him a full pardon,

152
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,531
restored all of his rights,
enabling him to be appointed.

153
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:02,032
And you have also
buried yourself, Hubert!

154
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,622
Governor, that's the most
stupid political stunt

155
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,874
anyone's ever tried
to pull on Bailey.

156
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,504
Jim! Jim, you want
to hear me out?

157
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,596
Jim, listen to me
for a minute!

158
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,765
Look, Jim, it's only
for two short months.

159
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,433
Now, even if he takes
the appointment,

160
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,810
he'd never run
for re-election,

161
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,603
and he'd never make it
if he did run.

162
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,064
The man is so disinterested
in everything political,

163
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,483
he probably wouldn't even
show up in the senate.

164
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,610
And look, by appointing him,

165
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,321
overnight our party
gets a whole new image.

166
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,948
You know, we get the human
righters, the environmentalists,

167
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,699
the Indians, the blacks,
the chicanos,

168
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,742
all those
who feel left out.

169
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,202
We get the youth vote.

170
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,705
Now, all that rubs off on us
for the next election,

171
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,498
and in two months
he's replaced.

172
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,542
Now you tell me, what
the hell's wrong with that?

173
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,629
Makes a lot of sense,
Mr. Bailey.

174
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,548
It's very clever.

175
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,967
We can really use that to
create the image of the party

176
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,804
that's bringing everybody
together.

177
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,181
That's real middle-of-the-road
America stuff.

178
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,850
And it fits in perfectly
with your campaign

179
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,310
of Joe Payne,
man of the people.

180
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:12,023
It's still a risk.

181
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,941
Okay, all right.

182
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,860
But don't let
that dumb cowboy--

183
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,528
ah-ah! Indian.

184
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,696
Cowboy, Indian, whatever!

185
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,032
Don't let him
open an eye, an ear,

186
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:25,619
or more important, his mouth.

187
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,375
Billy Jack:
Ah, grandfather...

188
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,127
What do we know of Washington,

189
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:37,297
let alone the dirty world
of politics?

190
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:41,510
Maybe that's why
you should go. As a test.

191
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:45,473
Politics has
its own kind of violence.

192
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:49,143
But how can I even think
of changing things out there

193
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,062
when I have so much work to do
in changing myself, in here?

194
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,857
If you want to become
a whole person,

195
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,485
you must first try
to make society better.

196
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,489
Before you have a right
to turn your back on it.

197
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,699
I don't think that I could
do it away from here,

198
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,535
though, grandfather.

199
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:09,205
I mean, the canyon lady
is all my strength now.

200
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,208
Then pray to her at sunrise.

201
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,251
If you ask her spirits
to guide and purify you,

202
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:18,381
dedicate your work to her,
and do the best you can,

203
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:22,881
then your work
will be your prayer,

204
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:27,014
and the results need
not concern you.

205
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,482
You know that classified
material senator foley

206
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,902
was waving around before
he had his heart attack?

207
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,404
I have it.

208
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:09,325
A lot of people wondering
what happened to that stuff.

209
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,452
I can leak it,
or I can trade it.

210
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,666
Well, what do you have in mind?

211
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:22,167
A white house level appointment,
and a salary of say, $48,000.

212
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,759
You play dangerous games, Dan.

213
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,553
Gary, I'm not playing games.

214
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,472
You get back to me
within 72 hours,

215
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,640
or I'll have to leak
this thing to the post.

216
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,060
Or maybe I'll give it to some
crusading young senator

217
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,438
who needs the publicity.

218
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,357
Well, all I can do
is make a report.

219
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,617
And in that spirit, we have
gathered here tonight to

220
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:56,117
acclaim and to bid godspeed to
the newest, and maybe in time,

221
00:15:56,706 --> 00:16:01,206
the best senator our state
has ever seen, Billy Jack.

222
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:13,305
Thank you, governor,
and, ladies and gentlemen,

223
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,433
I don't think we need
two men in Washington

224
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:19,353
when we have a senator like
Joseph Payne representing us.

225
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,067
He probably
doesn't remember me,

226
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:29,567
but you see, ah, he knew
my uncle very well.

227
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,115
William trotter was the name

228
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,493
they put on him
in the Christian school.

229
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,997
Man of the bear
was his Indian name.

230
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,666
Well, senator Payne
and my uncle worked together

231
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,833
on the restoration
of that Indian land

232
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,503
up around green lake
years ago,

233
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:49,004
and well, ah, I remember that my
uncle told me that Joseph Payne

234
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:54,596
was the finest man
that he had ever known.

235
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,238
Billy, you're so much
like your uncle.

236
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,367
Oh, well, thank you.

237
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,496
When I look at you, I can
almost see him sitting behind

238
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:22,791
that roll top desk, with his hat
on, getting out his newspaper.

239
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,752
He said he always
kept the hat on

240
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,254
so he'd be ready to do battle.

241
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,173
William trotter--
man of the bear--

242
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:32,885
editor, publisher, and
champion of lost causes.

243
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,304
Yeah, he always said the only
causes worth fighting for

244
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,888
were the lost causes.

245
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,473
You don't need to tell me.

246
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,934
We were a team, the two of us.

247
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,937
Struggling Indian
out of journalism school,

248
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,189
struggling lawyer-

249
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,691
they used to call us the twin
champions of lost causes,

250
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,569
and we took on plenty.

251
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,615
You might call us the first of
the store-front law centers.

252
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,866
We didn't have much to eat,

253
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,618
but we sure had
plenty of lost causes.

254
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,329
It was before your time.

255
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,999
Yeah, but our people
still talk of those battles.

256
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,128
His last fight
was his best, Billy.

257
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:10,339
He and that four page newspaper
against the mining syndicate

258
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,967
that had come to strip mine the
land, just like that black mesa.

259
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,803
Steal the reservations,
pollute the air,

260
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,346
and rape the sacred hill.

261
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:21,266
Ah, they tried everything--
bribery, intimidation.

262
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:23,769
And then.

263
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,103
What happened?

264
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,482
They found him slumped over
his desk one morning.

265
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:32,402
Shot in the back.

266
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:36,115
When I got there,
i could still see him

267
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,450
sitting at that roll top desk.

268
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,704
Still with his hat on.

269
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,166
Still with his hat on.

270
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,757
Come in

271
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:54,884
am I interrupting?

272
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,219
Oh, come in, Saunders.

273
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,305
Sit down, sit down.

274
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,475
Now, what's all this about
you're wanting to quit?

275
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,935
Look, senator,
i wasn't given a brain

276
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,480
just to tell some nature boy
what time it is.

277
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,982
I'm not a registered nurse.

278
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,275
Sam foley couldn't
get along without you,

279
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,569
and neither can i
at the moment.

280
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,654
Five minutes, senator.

281
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,114
You've got to get
to the floor.

282
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,365
I'll be right there,

283
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,034
and get that foreign relations
material ready, will you?

284
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,953
It's right there at your
fingertips, all of it.

285
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,372
Now look, Saunders, I haven't
got time to go into all this,

286
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,333
but foley told me wild horses

287
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,628
couldn't pull confidential
material out of you.

288
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:35,049
I'm an old hand at following
instructions, senator.

289
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:39,549
I need someone who can be
trusted to occupy Billy Jack

290
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:40,971
and keep him out of trouble.

291
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,348
Oh, but, senator,
i just, I won't do that.

292
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,143
But, Saunders, you too smart
a girl to do anything foolish.

293
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,437
Now if certain things
happen to me,

294
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:53,024
I'm taking everybody
up with me.

295
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,693
Sir, when I first got
to this city,

296
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,655
my eyes were big
green question marks.

297
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:01,033
Now they're big green
dollar marks.

298
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,117
All right.

299
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,828
You finish this job properly,

300
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:07,164
keep him away from anything
that smells of politics,

301
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,083
and not only will you receive
a very handsome bonus,

302
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:13,420
but one of the best jobs
in Washington.

303
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,713
Thank you, sir.

304
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,884
Thank you very much, senator.

305
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,343
Oh, senator,
does the smell of politics

306
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:24,844
include the willet creek
nuclear reactor?

307
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,146
If you're speaking
of the deficiency bill,

308
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,565
especially that.

309
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,370
Senator, good morning.

310
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,662
We were a little curious

311
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,332
how you'd be voting
on the energy bill.

312
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,543
Oh, ah, I'll be voting no
on the energy bill.

313
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:58,044
I see. Ls this the way senator
Payne advised you to vote?

314
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:01,343
Senator Payne is also voting no,
is that what you mean?

315
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,596
Yes, thank you.

316
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,349
To my mind, I can think
of nothing more pressing,

317
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,017
in view of the depletion
of our resources

318
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,729
and the advanced inadequacy
of our technology

319
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:16,229
to magically solve our problems
as we have supposed.

320
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,861
And in view of the imminent
possibility

321
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,864
of our running out
of energy of all kinds,

322
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,365
I urge immediate passage

323
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,492
of the gentleman
from Colorado's bill.

324
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,669
Pardon me, senator,
but either I'm hearing things,

325
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,587
or I actually heard you

326
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,464
just urging passage
of the energy bill.

327
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,383
That's right.

328
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,593
Well, sir, I just told
the press outside

329
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,262
that both of us
were voting no.

330
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,347
I am voting no.

331
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,641
I'm sorry.
Now I don't understand.

332
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,394
You see,
half the people back home

333
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,729
wanted a speech urging
passage of the bill,

334
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,648
and the other half
wanted us to vote no.

335
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,193
This way, everybody's happy.

336
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,945
In order to get the vital
issues taken care of,

337
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,156
you've got to
sugar coat the rest

338
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,158
so there's a little
something for everybody.

339
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,826
But, sir,
this is a vital issue.

340
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,120
Exactly.
It's much too sensitive

341
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,122
to ever come up for a vote.

342
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,581
It will be referred
back to committee

343
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,750
where it'll be buried.

344
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,252
You'll get used to it.

345
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,838
Ah, Joe, I'd like
to work out a little trade

346
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,216
on my cotton subsidy bill.

347
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,259
Frankly, senator,
i think I made a mistake

348
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,636
when I accepted
this appointment.

349
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,638
No, wait a minute.

350
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,766
Didn't you say something about
a national children's camp?

351
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,768
Now, I assume you were
in earnest about that?

352
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,352
Well, yes, very much so.

353
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,520
Well, there.

354
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,023
I've got a job for both of you.

355
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,150
Why don't you
put a bill together

356
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,193
to accomplish that and
present it to congress?

357
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,362
Now, that'd be a great
experience for Billy,

358
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,823
and for you
as a legislative aide.

359
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,534
You know, if we could do just

360
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,369
that one thing
while we're here--

361
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,204
I mean, if we could
make that children's camp

362
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,371
become a reality.

363
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,456
Well, what's to stop you?

364
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,082
Saunders
will help you with it.

365
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,918
There isn't anyone on the hill

366
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,711
smarter than Saunders
about senate procedure.

367
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,508
You know, this whole business
of politics is a kind of art--

368
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,092
a hand-me-down
from one generation

369
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,053
to the next art at that.

370
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,821
Guard:
Guards, halt.

371
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,455
Well?

372
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,583
It's all been arranged.

373
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,752
White house
or state department?

374
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:45,215
Junior executive level for six
months, then it's up to you.

375
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,634
When will the appointment come?

376
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,345
30 days after delivery.

377
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:54,057
How will they know the delivery
is all that you have?

378
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,809
You wouldn't hold back any
hidden copies from me,

379
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:56,643
would you, Dan?

380
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:58,270
Hey! Come on.

381
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,356
How long have we
known each other?

382
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:07,154
You have my word.

383
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,906
What do you mean,
the head man's writing a bill?

384
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,909
He's a senator, isn't he?

385
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:13,243
Wants to work all night.

386
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,828
Honey, you know foley's
classified files?

387
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,081
Does anyone besides me
know you've got that?

388
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:21,001
Hey, honey, not now.

389
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,920
We'll talk about it
later, okay?

390
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,130
Don't work too hard.

391
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,422
And have a good time.

392
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,934
You have any idea
what it takes

393
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,603
to get a bill passed
through congress?

394
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,813
I haven't the vaguest idea

395
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,148
what it takes to
get a bill passed,

396
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,358
but Payne said
you're an expert.

397
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,943
Just tell us,
what do we have to do?

398
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:51,031
Let's pretend its tomorrow
and your bill is ready.

399
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,450
You just take it on over
to the honorable senate

400
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,451
and you introduce it.

401
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,577
How?

402
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,203
You get to your feet
and take a deep breath,

403
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,538
and you start spouting.

404
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:01,542
Then a curly-haired page
will take it down to a desk

405
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,126
where a long-faced clerk
will read it

406
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,129
and refer it
to the right committee.

407
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,296
Why a committee?

408
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,630
Because that's how congress

409
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,507
or any other large body
has to be run.

410
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,051
All your work has to be
done through committees.

411
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,052
Yeah, but why?

412
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,178
You can't just take a bill

413
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,470
no one's
ever heard of before

414
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,514
and discuss it
among 100 men,

415
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,391
most of whom
aren't there anyway

416
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:21,311
because they're off
on campaigns or committees.

417
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,812
Anyway, where are we?

418
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,564
- We're in committee.
- In committee, right.

419
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,150
All right, well they hand it
down to a sub-committee.

420
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:29,236
And then they really
give it a going over.

421
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:32,239
They hold hearings, they call
in people, they ask questions.

422
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,659
Now, days are going by,
senator. Days, weeks maybe.

423
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,077
All right, say finally
after all that,

424
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,703
they think it's quite a bill.

425
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,914
It goes on over to
the house of representatives

426
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,415
for a debate and a vote.

427
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,668
Only it has to wait
its turn on the calendar.

428
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,419
A calendar?

429
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,839
Calendar. You know,
the order of business.

430
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,716
Anyway, your bill has to wait
way back there in line,

431
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,385
unless you know somebody
on a steering committee

432
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,511
and you can
get them to think--

433
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,929
- what is that?
- What?

434
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,597
A steering committee.

435
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,516
It's a committee
of majority party leaders,

436
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,185
and they decide whether
a bill is important enough

437
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,354
to be moved up
to the head of the list.

438
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,064
I betcha we could
get Payne to help.

439
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,232
Oh, yeah.

440
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,192
Oh, yeah, he'll be a big help.

441
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,861
Oh, okay, where are we?

442
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,445
We're in the house.

443
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:15,949
Ah, house makes more changes,
and more amendments,

444
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,867
and they send it
back over to the senate.

445
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:20,120
The senate doesn't like what
the house did to the bill,

446
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,871
so they make more changes.

447
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:25,458
And then the house doesn't like
those changes, so it's stymied.

448
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:29,546
So they have to call in
a man from both houses,

449
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,756
and they go into a huddle,
called a conference,

450
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,133
and they battle it out.

451
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,469
Now, in the meantime,
all the lobbyists interested

452
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,972
are holding cocktail parties
for and against the bill,

453
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:43,472
and unmarked envelopes are being
generously supplied with cash

454
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,646
and passed out
to all the swing votes.

455
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,982
Anyway, after all this
vivisection,

456
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,317
it begins to be traded.

457
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,320
That means that somebody
can trade off a portion

458
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,404
in their bill

459
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,739
if you'll trade off
a portion in your bill

460
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,992
and make everybody happy.

461
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:02,912
And after all this, the bill
finally comes to a vote.

462
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:07,413
Oh, yeah, the big day finally
comes, and congress adjourns.

463
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,504
You catching on, senator?

464
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,088
Sort of.

465
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,759
Well...

466
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:19,262
When do we start?

467
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:20,764
What?

468
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,851
Senator, do you think
we could get on

469
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:26,436
with the particulars now?

470
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,979
Four hundred acres, you say?

471
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,481
Where's it gonna be located?

472
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,775
Situated in ambrose county,
kerry canyon,

473
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,778
right at the fork
on the river,

474
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,864
about a mile and half
upstream on willett creek.

475
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:40,158
- Where?
- Willett creek.

476
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,703
It's just where the stream
rolls down into the river.

477
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:43,870
In kerry canyon?

478
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,122
Yeah, why?
Do you know about it?

479
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,039
Have you ever been out there?

480
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,499
No, no, I haven't.

481
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,711
Have you discussed this exact
location with senator Payne?

482
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:54,506
No, not the exact location.

483
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,049
Why?

484
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,843
No reason. No reason.

485
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:02,347
Four hundred acres,
either side of willett creek.

486
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,558
So, dragging me up
to the hill at this hour,

487
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,060
this really better be good.

488
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,728
I don't know
if it's gonna be good,

489
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,355
but it's certainly
gonna be interesting.

490
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,231
You know, for a guy who's
supposed to have been so brave,

491
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,566
I've never seen anybody
more nervous

492
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,402
about getting up
and reading a bill.

493
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,569
By the way, honey,

494
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,405
do you know where the keys
to the safe deposit box are?

495
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,156
Yeah, but why?
Don't you?

496
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,324
Oh, sure.

497
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:22,659
What'd ya ask for?

498
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,701
Just checking.

499
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,953
Come on.

500
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,586
Sit tight, fellas,
the show is about to begin.

501
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:34,879
What show?

502
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,590
Would you tell us
what's happening?

503
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,842
Certainly. If you look
right down there,

504
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,927
you'll see the principle
actor in our little drama,

505
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,763
don quixote with the bill.

506
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:47,058
And over there, a very important
supporting character, Mr. clean.

507
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,852
- Mr. clean?
- Mcgann.

508
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,353
You mean Bailey's deep throat?

509
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,105
The same.

510
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,191
And right below you is the
co-star, our man of the people.

511
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:57,611
Soul of honor, on a tightrope.

512
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,738
Bill all set?
Oh, yes, senator.

513
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:00,780
Got it here.

514
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,574
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

515
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,701
Saunders,
what part do we play?

516
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,868
Oh, anything you like--

517
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,579
shortstop, center field,
whatever.

518
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,788
What are you good at?

519
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,123
You'll have to excuse her,
people.

520
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,541
- She's a little freaked out.
- No, darling.

521
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,251
Listen, in a couple
of minutes,

522
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,045
don quixote
over there with the bill

523
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:18,048
is going to stand up and repeat
two very important words--

524
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,050
willett creek.

525
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,469
When that happens,
our man of the people

526
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,220
will fall right off
of his tightrope,

527
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:27,432
and Mr. clean over there will
disappear in a white tornado.

528
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,227
Dan, what are those kids
supplying her with?

529
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,146
Should we give her
a blood test or something?

530
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,355
Why, do you think
she's pregnant?

531
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:35,732
That's not exactly
what I had in mind.

532
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:36,983
I'm sorry. Are you?

533
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,068
I don't really think
that's even funny.

534
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,277
Well, I'm just asking.

535
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,113
Or asking her. Excuse me.

536
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,739
- There's ways.
- Well are you?

537
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,948
- No.
- All right.

538
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,159
Introduction of bills
and joint resolutions.

539
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,160
Ah, sir!

540
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:56,128
The chair recognizes

541
00:29:56,128 --> 00:30:00,628
the rather strong-lunged
junior senator, Jack.

542
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:05,678
Mr. president,
i have here a bill

543
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,682
that I would like
to introduce to the senate.

544
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,392
You may speak louder, senator.

545
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,939
I said that I have
a bill here, sir,

546
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:20,360
that I would like to, uh,
introduce here to the...

547
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,820
To the senate.

548
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,868
Order in the gallery.

549
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:31,997
Our junior senator
is about to make a speech.

550
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:36,497
I am sending to the desk,
Mr. president,

551
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,711
for appropriate reference,

552
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:42,632
a bill that would result
in the appropriation

553
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,717
of a sufficient sum

554
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:47,846
to establish
a national youth camp,

555
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,807
the money of which
would be paid

556
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,892
back to the United States
treasury

557
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:55,353
by fundraising activities

558
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:59,483
done on a voluntary basis
by youth all over America.

559
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:03,983
You see, this camp would be
situated on, and adjacent to,

560
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:07,490
a stream known
back in my state

561
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:11,369
as willett creek
in kerry canyon.

562
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:15,870
And it would be for the purpose
of bringing together children

563
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,920
from all walks of life
who have been impoverished,

564
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:25,175
deprived, and abused,
and they would come--

565
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,218
listen Joe, I'm getting
leery of this guy.

566
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,720
Everyone
keeps calling him dumb,

567
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,346
but we forget
he's a west point graduate,

568
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,766
and when he finds out there's
a nuclear plant going up

569
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,184
where he wants to build
that kids' camp,

570
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,227
he's going to start asking
questions six ways from Sunday.

571
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,646
Quiet, chick, I want to think.

572
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,564
How could Saunders let him
pick willett creek?

573
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,732
No, I'm sure Saunders had
nothing to do with picking

574
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,608
the location.

575
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,236
The important thing is
the deficiency bill

576
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,780
is going to be read
in the senate tomorrow.

577
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,615
Tomorrow, Joe?

578
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,992
He'll hear that section
on the nuclear plant.

579
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,326
He can't be there tomorrow.

580
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,245
I know that.
Get a hold of yourself.

581
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,581
I'm in over my head.
I'm calling Bailey.

582
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,791
You'll do nothing of the kind.

583
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,252
Bailey's methods wouldn't work
in a situation like this.

584
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,004
He'd come in with a bulldozer.

585
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,048
Get Saunders over to my office
as soon as you can.

586
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,300
Convention?

587
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,302
What kind of convention
are you talking about?

588
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,012
I'm not really clear on it,
senator.

589
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,973
It's some national coalition
of citizen action groups.

590
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,392
They've come here to try

591
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,185
and get a national initiative
passed by the congress.

592
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,853
You know,
like that referendum thing

593
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,939
they had in California
on nuclear energy.

594
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,482
- Nuclear energy?
- Don't worry.

595
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,485
It's just a rinky-dink
grass roots type of thing.

596
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,570
All right.
Then get him over there.

597
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:28,947
Him and Jean, and those kids.

598
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,740
I don't want one of them
anywhere near the senate

599
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,825
when that deficiency bill
comes up on the floor.

600
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,622
I can count on you, Saunders?

601
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,624
Anything for a bonus, senator.

602
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:47,127
Joe, Billy Jack's little
raiders are digging up

603
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:50,718
some very sensitive material
on the whole nuclear program

604
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:54,264
that's making a lot of people
all over the hill very nervous.

605
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,724
Enough to get some pressure
applied, if you need it.

606
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,520
No.

607
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:07,610
I don't know who
your friends are, but no.

608
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:08,528
I'll handle this.

609
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,155
See, what this is is

610
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:14,200
these are people from all sorts
of consumer advocate groups

611
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:17,120
who have found that doing
their own thing

612
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,832
in their separate places
isn't enough.

613
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,544
So, added to that they've
kind of gotten together,

614
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,505
not instead of what you're
doing, but in addition, right?

615
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:30,675
And, um, they've decided
to put all their power together

616
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,385
and try to get
a national initiative

617
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,303
for a nuclear freeze.

618
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:38,016
You gotta help me.
I don't know what that is.

619
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,892
A national initiative?

620
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,728
The initiative basically means

621
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,855
that people can write
their own laws,

622
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,857
and if they get enough
signatures on petitions,

623
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,359
then it goes on the ballot
for all the people to vote on.

624
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,696
And if fifty percent plus one
of the people vote for the law,

625
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,239
it becomes the law of the land.

626
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,033
So you want this
instead of a congress?

627
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,201
This will be
as well as a congress.

628
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,704
The congress can do their work,
they can get the laws through.

629
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,915
They will continue the same
way they are going on now--

630
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,418
through bribery, mostly--

631
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:08,003
...but this will be
a chance for the people

632
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,298
themselves to have a direct
say in the government.

633
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,676
It costs so much now
to get elected

634
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,804
that the congressmen
aren't any of them free.

635
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,847
They belong to the people
who paid for their elections.

636
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,390
They don't belong
to any of us at all.

637
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,725
I mean, how many times

638
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,852
have you heard someone
complaining about something

639
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,979
but totally unable
to do anything about it?

640
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,606
And besides that,

641
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,774
it makes government
responsive to the people.

642
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,901
You need an alternative route.

643
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,694
If the congress is
bought out on an issue,

644
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,655
like they are on nuclear power,
for example,

645
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,448
you need an alternative
route for the people.

646
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,866
And when they get mad,

647
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,909
there should be a creative
response by the people.

648
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,829
Think of what would have
happened during 1967 and 1968,

649
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,915
during the Vietnam war,
if the people could have gone

650
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,584
and petitioned
and put on the ballot

651
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,087
a vote against
the Vietnam war.

652
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,755
We would have ended it
in 1968.

653
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,423
We wouldn't have had
to have the demonstrations.

654
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,426
We wouldn't have had
to have the Kent states.

655
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,927
Might not have had
to have the war.

656
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,595
It's also going to influence
members of congress,

657
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,932
because they like to be on
the right side of the issue,

658
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,934
and if they know that it's
a very controversial issue,

659
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,435
and there's going to be
a national initiative

660
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,854
if they don't take action,

661
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,313
they're going to be more
hesitant about it.

662
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:09,274
They're going to say "lt's going
to make me look like a fool."

663
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,858
They're going to be
more careful.

664
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,570
What is it you want him to do?
I don't quite understand.

665
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,780
Well, we'd like him to
sponsor a bill in the senate

666
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,073
to give people
a national initiative.

667
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,035
- Right.
- But he just sponsored a bill.

668
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,328
Isn't that what you just did?

669
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,830
- I am.
- He came and marched there.

670
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,997
He was the ones who--

671
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,332
what are you doing
on your lunch hour?

672
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:30,086
There's a tiny
little catch to this thing.

673
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,129
Remember before when I was
introducing these people?

674
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,673
I was telling you
about this neat picnic

675
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,758
- that we're having, huh?
- Yeah.

676
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,135
Well, we're all invited,

677
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,846
but you're kind of
specially invited

678
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,430
because in order to get people

679
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:43,641
to know about
the nuclear freeze,

680
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,311
they're having this huge
parade and rally,

681
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:50,811
and, uh, they'd just love
to have a senator to be...

682
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:58,277
To be the...
The grand Marshall.

683
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,741
They would like what?

684
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,952
For you to be
the grand Marshall.

685
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,955
What fun it would be.

686
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,164
I mean, you could write it

687
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,250
under "special events"
in your diary.

688
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:44,452
This all of it?

689
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:53,127
As an old country boy,
I'll give you a little advice.

690
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:58,174
Pigs get fat,
hogs get slaughtered.

691
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,849
You were a fool, Dan.

692
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,222
Dan: Please, don't.

693
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,435
Please, don't.

694
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:24,928
Jean: I wish there was some
way we could help, Saunders.

695
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:27,764
Is there anything we can do?

696
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:31,601
Billy Jack: Do you know
anybody who had it in for him?

697
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,811
I mean, there must
be some reason.

698
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,021
Saunders: Come on, Billy.

699
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,189
This is Washington, baby.

700
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,357
The big leagues.

701
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,485
Murder is just
a way of life here.

702
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,694
Billy Jack: Do you really
believe that?

703
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,321
Saunders: They murder
presidents here, Billy!

704
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,158
They murder men who are
running for president here!

705
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,703
They murder the Martin Luther
kings and the Jimmy hoffas!

706
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,287
Lobbyists?

707
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,331
Lobbyists like Dan?

708
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,125
Small fry.

709
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,543
They go one a week.

710
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:00,964
It's always made to look
like a heart attack,

711
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,298
a rape murder,

712
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:06,010
an overdose or suicide.

713
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,556
Billy Jack: Ls there
some way we could use

714
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:12,642
the office here
to investigate it?

715
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:17,063
Oh, would you two come off
your goddamned decency crap?

716
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:20,733
Do you know how much money
is spent here every week?

717
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,818
12 billion dollars.

718
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,488
That's two hundred and fifty
million dollars an hour,

719
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,573
up for grabs
each and every hour.

720
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:30,535
It's all secret groups
and who you know!

721
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,411
Cliques!

722
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:35,415
Secret groups
within the secret groups!

723
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,208
Read this, senator.

724
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,084
Senator Jack, read it.

725
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:43,089
This is the deficiency bill,
senator.

726
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,423
Did you hear of it?

727
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:45,425
Read it!

728
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,260
Check section number 40.

729
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,678
You know what's going up

730
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,596
right where you want
your little camp to be?

731
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:51,931
A nuclear reactor.

732
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,098
Remember the name?

733
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,850
Nuclear reactor, senator,

734
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,019
going up right where never
never land is supposed to be.

735
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,187
Did you ever read about that?

736
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,354
Well, of course you didn't.

737
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,440
They read all about it
today in the senate,

738
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,067
but you weren't
supposed to be there.

739
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,360
That's why we dragged you down
to that stupid convention

740
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,570
and bullcrapped you
into thinking

741
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:09,115
we were gonna really
help you get it financed.

742
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:12,076
That's why they sent you
here in the first place!

743
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,369
Because you wouldn't
know a nuclear reactor

744
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,288
from an erector set.

745
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,541
You want to be a senator.

746
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,917
Why don't you just try

747
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,295
and mess up
Mr. Bailey's little graph?

748
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,547
And all the other baileys
that are gonna come in here

749
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,799
year after year.

750
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,300
You can't.

751
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:31,721
Baby, you can't,
not in 19 million years.

752
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,764
Why don't you just go home?

753
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,684
Go home before they kill you.

754
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,870
Billy you hardly gave me
a chance to get dressed.

755
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,747
I apologize for barging in
at this hour, sir,

756
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,708
but this is extremely
important to us.

757
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,251
Of course, come on in.

758
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,627
Ah, no thank you, sir.

759
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,130
Well, can I get you
something? Chick!

760
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,631
No, uh, thank you.

761
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:14,847
Uh, senator, look,
i may not know Washington

762
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,515
and how things operate here,

763
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,601
but I do know
that willett creek district

764
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,019
like the back of my hand,

765
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,854
and tonight I was informed

766
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,648
that a nuclear plant
is gonna go up there.

767
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,192
Is that what's bothering you?

768
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,526
I thought from the way
you sounded

769
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:28,903
there was a fire somewhere.

770
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,821
Senator, that's right next
to a big earthquake fault.

771
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,032
No, that's all been put
through the state legislature

772
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,284
and approved. They had
the finest seismologists

773
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,828
and geophysicists in the country
check over that sight.

774
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,413
That's just the point.

775
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,457
There are at least
a hundred places in the state

776
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,750
that are obviously safer.

777
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,545
Senator, something very
strange is going on here,

778
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:49,257
and I'm sorry, but I am not
going to vote on that bill

779
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,259
until I get a lot
of questions answered.

780
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,344
Billy, you're jousting
with windmills.

781
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,636
How so?

782
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,388
You're trying
to understand in a month

783
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:59,433
everything about a project
that took two years to set up.

784
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:02,562
The reasons, the surveys,
the benefits--

785
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,480
speaking of benefits,

786
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,108
what does a man named Bailey
have to do with all of this?

787
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,611
What makes you think Bailey
has anything to do with it?

788
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:13,947
Senator, we heard that
the whole thing was his idea.

789
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,951
Do you fully realize
what you're saying?

790
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,453
You might as well accuse me
of helping to frame a bill

791
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,289
to benefit one individual,

792
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,542
of helping to frame
a scheme for graft.

793
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,753
No, no, senator,
nobody's trying to imply that,

794
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:31,215
but we do know that this Bailey
has something to do with it,

795
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,134
and I think it's critical that
we, for both of our sakes,

796
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,262
find out exactly what.

797
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,478
Billy Jack: All right,
i want everybody up.

798
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,981
I want to find out all
about this Mr. Bailey,

799
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,315
and I don't mean

800
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,651
just his newspaper, radio,
and television stations.

801
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,486
I want to find out
how many of his companies

802
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,739
are making a profit
on this nuclear reactor.

803
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,949
And I'd like to know
exactly who he's paying off

804
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,493
here in Washington in order
to get all the contracts.

805
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,537
Carol: Just find the secret
file foley had on him

806
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,121
when he had
his heart attack.

807
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,624
Why? What does foley's
file got to do with Bailey?

808
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,627
We're pretty sure it contained
all the names, dates,

809
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:10,630
and amounts of all the nuclear
payoffs, including Bailey's.

810
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,256
Not to mention who's been
canceling

811
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,840
all the nuclear
hearings.

812
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,676
Next you guys will think
Bailey can reach

813
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,968
all the way
into the white house.

814
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,638
Are you kidding? This town
is just one big clique,

815
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,724
and everybody's in bed
with everybody else.

816
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:22,975
All right, then let's find out

817
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:26,228
who exactly is in bed
with Mr. Bailey.

818
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:29,232
Now he wants to talk to every
one of the congressmen,

819
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,525
including bill from the
willett creek district here.

820
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:34,278
He's got all their names,
their voting records.

821
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,822
In one month, he's got more
groups out to destroy him

822
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,241
than any man in the history
of the senate.

823
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:40,409
Come on now, mcghan,
don't be ridiculous.

824
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,160
If it's so ridiculous,
why has the white house

825
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,913
already got a whole unit
investigating it?

826
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:47,374
I don't see the problem.

827
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,502
Let the white house
take care of him.

828
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:52,171
Now just a minute, Jim.
This is ridiculous!

829
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,089
I told you I'd handle him.

830
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,842
I strongly object to you
bringing Jim into this.

831
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:58,302
Mr. Bailey,

832
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,678
<i>senator Jack
is here to see you.</i>

833
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,514
Oh, fine, show him in.

834
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:05,059
Did you ask Billy Jack
to come over here?

835
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,728
Chick.

836
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:12,228
Jim, if you bring him in here,
you can count me out.

837
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,363
Go ahead.

838
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,199
Count me out.

839
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,249
Good morning, senator.
Mr. Bailey's expecting you.

840
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:37,884
Senator,
glad you could make it.

841
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:41,095
Chick, does the senator
know all the boys here?

842
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,554
Uh, some of them, Mr. Bailey.

843
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:45,057
Fine. You know congressman
Underwood I'm sure,

844
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,934
and Mr. barkoff of
the utilities commission.

845
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,895
Chick, acquaint him
with the others,

846
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:51,564
and have Orlando
bring him some breakfast.

847
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:53,399
Excuse me for just one moment.

848
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:56,777
Senator, this is Joe saldo
from the interior.

849
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,863
Matthew tillard of the nuclear
regulatory commission.

850
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,369
Jim, that boy is a senator.

851
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,914
However it happened,
he's a United States senator.

852
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:10,541
Now, we're not back home.

853
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,168
This is Washington, D.C.

854
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:14,628
Sq?

855
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,797
This boy is different.

856
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:17,923
Honest.

857
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,759
He's a decent man.

858
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:22,219
And besides,
he thinks the world of me.

859
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,223
We can't do this to him.

860
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:29,518
Joe, some our closet friends
are liable to go bankrupt

861
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,561
if this bill
doesn't go through.

862
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,814
Now, I am not going
to let that happen.

863
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:36,107
I don't care how much
he worships you.

864
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,944
I won't stand for it.

865
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:41,906
- You won't stand for it?
- That's right!

866
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,867
I won't have any part
of crucifying that boy.

867
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:49,789
Oh, I see.

868
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,001
Well, maybe I can fix it

869
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,628
so that you and your
half breed friend in there

870
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:58,547
can go back home together.

871
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,173
What on earth
are you talking about?

872
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:05,554
Seems such a shame,
after all these years,

873
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,765
especially with
the last elections

874
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,559
and the party scattered.

875
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,479
I mean, you were shaping up
to be the logical man

876
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,523
to build it all back
together again.

877
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,443
It only takes 20 or 30 of us

878
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,944
to pull off
a national convention,

879
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:22,029
you know that.

880
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:28,448
Well, I guess we're just going
to have to find somebody else.

881
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:32,289
But right now,
you go back in there

882
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:35,584
and explain to Mr. Jack
all about willett creek.

883
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,795
Well, after all,
it's your bill.

884
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,048
You engineered
the whole thing.

885
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:44,260
Well, what do you
think he's gonna do

886
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,428
when you tell him
the whole story, huh?

887
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:48,764
Smile, roll over,
and show us his belly

888
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,432
just because
he worships you?

889
00:46:56,522 --> 00:47:00,442
All right, I'll take
the next plane home, Joe,

890
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,820
if that's what you want.

891
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,739
I'm just sorry
it had to work out this way.

892
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:12,788
No hard feelings
if I have to come after you.

893
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:21,501
Jim, it's... just
that I like this boy.

894
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,133
And...

895
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:28,303
And I don't want to see you
get too rough on him.

896
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:37,229
You know, you really had me
worried there for a minute.

897
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:41,817
Listen, why don't you
go back to your office, huh?

898
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,861
I'll give you a call
as soon as I'm through.

899
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,155
No, you don't have
to go back that way.

900
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,626
Sorry to have kept you
waiting, senator,

901
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:02,504
but I had a small domestic
problem to cope with,

902
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:05,341
but since I'm in town
for a couple of weeks,

903
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:07,134
I thought I'd take
this opportunity

904
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,385
of knowing you better.

905
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:09,929
A little coffee?

906
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,221
No, thank you.

907
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:15,767
They tell me that you're
right on your toes.

908
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:17,978
Made a lot of enemies
overnight.

909
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,980
Well, that's fine, great.

910
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,940
Means your doing something.

911
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:27,070
You know a lot of people
told me that you were dumb.

912
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:32,826
But somehow I think
that you're smart enough

913
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:36,539
to understand a situation
when it's explained to you.

914
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:38,123
Like what?

915
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:40,626
The reactor on willett creek.

916
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,961
Mmmmm.

917
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:47,462
Just what's your interest
in this reactor, Mr. Bailey?

918
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,011
Well, you should know
the answer to that, senator.

919
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,555
I mean, as chairman
of the political party

920
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:55,307
and office in our state,

921
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:58,852
anything that benefits the state
is of interest to me.

922
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,188
And, besides
being a politician,

923
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,689
I have a lot of holdings
in the state,

924
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,901
like newspapers
and some other odds and ends.

925
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,987
Construction companies?
Equipment companies?

926
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:11,824
Architectural firms,
things like that?

927
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:15,327
I told you he was smart.

928
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,995
Good!

929
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:20,124
Well, let's lay out everything
on the table, Billy.

930
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,669
If I thought that you had the
welfare of the state at heart

931
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,714
like I do-- well, for example,

932
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:31,093
if you were to be cooperative
about this project

933
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,844
instead of obstructive,

934
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:36,348
well, then I'd say
you'd be a man to watch.

935
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,516
For instance,
there's no reason

936
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,852
why you couldn't come
back to that senate seat

937
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:42,855
for as long a time
as you wanted.

938
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:47,355
Take these gentleman here,
or your idol Joe Payne.

939
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:51,363
They don't have to ever worry
about being re-elected,

940
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:54,240
or anything else,
for that matter,

941
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,452
because they take advice.

942
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,538
Are you trying to tell me

943
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,624
that you tell all
of these gentlemen here

944
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:06,378
and that you tell
Joe Payne what to do?

945
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:08,880
Joe Payne has been
taking my advice

946
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:12,217
ever since he started running
for office over 30 years ago.

947
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,512
You're a liar.

948
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:26,231
Billy, Washington is a very
small and incestuous town.

949
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:30,569
I came here prepared for you.
I give you my word on that.

950
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,116
If you so much as open your
mouth on that senate floor

951
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,076
tomorrow when that bill
is read--

952
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:51,423
now that...

953
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:54,884
Is exactly what I think
of your threat, Mr. Bailey.

954
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,460
Hey, have any of you guys
seen Carol?

955
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,546
No, I think
she went to the deli.

956
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:33,590
The deli
at this time of night?

957
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,259
Who went with her?

958
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,552
Um, I don't think
anybody went with her.

959
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:39,596
You're kidding.

960
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:41,390
Oh, cripes.

961
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:34,943
What the hell
is going on out here!

962
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,614
Don't!

963
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:52,419
Get away from her!

964
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:14,854
Ok, who are you guys anyway?

965
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,070
Why are you doing this?

966
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,451
What do you want?

967
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,328
We need your clothes...

968
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,663
Off.

969
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,286
Looks like one
of your neighborhood

970
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:09,621
welcoming committee

971
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:13,166
dropped this expensive
walkie talkie back there.

972
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:15,586
They aren't neighborhood.

973
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:18,505
Uh, who-- who did hire you?

974
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:22,467
Ah, come on, fellas,
you can tell us.

975
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:24,845
There's nobody else
in the warehouse here.

976
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:27,138
FBI?

977
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:29,474
CIA street fighting team?

978
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:33,770
Or maybe Bailey.

979
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,524
Whose idea was it to use
black agents, fellas?

980
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:42,403
Is it supposed to make it
look like a racial incident?

981
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:51,205
You guys ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

982
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:53,624
I mean, kunta kinte would
turn over in his grave

983
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,543
if he saw you hire out
to the man like this.

984
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:02,507
You know, it's bad enough
when policemen break the law

985
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:07,008
by opening people's mail,
tapping telephones, but rape?

986
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:10,515
I mean, you know,
the next thing is

987
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:14,311
you guys will get it in your
heads to assassinate somebody.

988
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,813
You don't buy
any of that, do ya?

989
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:17,940
No way.

990
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,027
Well, I guess
that makes us even

991
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,321
because the one thing
that I really can't buy

992
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,282
is policemen
who break the law.

993
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:50,848
Hold it!

994
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,148
I'll tell you, friend.

995
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:05,691
Now, you really are
one hard man to...

996
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,157
Purify

997
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,713
ah, senator,
and what can I do for--

998
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:29,177
oh, hello, Billy.
Come on in.

999
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:35,475
Well, did you have
your talk with Bailey?

1000
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,810
I had my talk
with Mr. Bailey.

1001
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,522
He told me that he's been
telling you what to do

1002
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,440
for the past 30 years.

1003
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:47,320
I called him a liar.

1004
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:51,821
Listen, son, come on over here
and sit down, will you?

1005
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:56,742
I'm sorry. I don't feel very
much like sitting down, sir.

1006
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:01,084
Oh, lord,
i know how you feel.

1007
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,712
I was hoping you'd be
spared all this.

1008
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:07,924
You've been living
in a dream world, Billy.

1009
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,636
The idealist sees everything
as black and white,

1010
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:12,137
angel and devil,

1011
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,347
but that isn't how it goes
in the real world.

1012
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:17,601
It's cruel, brutal, unfair.

1013
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,477
You don't belong here, Billy.

1014
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,771
Forget Bailey
and what he said.

1015
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:24,107
Forget you ever heard of
the willett creek reactor.

1016
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,317
That doesn't
answer my question.

1017
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:28,778
Does Bailey
tell you how to vote?

1018
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:33,279
Now, listen, Billy.
Please try to understand.

1019
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:37,078
I know it's tough to run head-on
into the world of facts,

1020
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:40,457
but it's a question
of give and take.

1021
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,667
You've got to play
by these rules.

1022
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:44,378
You've got to compromise.

1023
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:47,422
If one must shut his eyes
that a reactor has to be built,

1024
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,173
it's a small compromise.

1025
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:53,094
The best men ever to serve in
this senate had to make deals.

1026
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:55,138
You understand that?

1027
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:59,308
Your Thomas Jefferson
had to make one on slavery,

1028
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,227
or the declaration
of independence

1029
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:03,480
would have never have gone
out of committee.

1030
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,358
Now, believe me,
i know how you feel.

1031
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:11,859
30 years ago,
i had those ideals too.

1032
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:13,490
I was you!

1033
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,617
I had to make the decision
you're being asked to make

1034
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:16,909
today, and I made it.

1035
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,162
I compromised.

1036
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,247
Yes, I compromised,

1037
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:24,251
so that all these years
i could sit in the senate

1038
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:27,671
and serve the people
in a thousand beneficial ways.

1039
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:30,757
You have to make alliances
with organizations

1040
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,717
like Bailey's and
the big corporations.

1041
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:35,429
You have to play ball,
or you can't survive.

1042
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:37,848
You can't count
on the people voting.

1043
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:40,350
You know how many people
voted in my last election?

1044
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,186
Less than 22%
of the registered voters.

1045
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,521
All I had to do was get 11%,

1046
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:49,359
and Bailey's machine can
turn that out every time.

1047
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,819
I know you're not going
to decide as I did.

1048
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,488
I can see that in your eyes.

1049
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:57,200
But I told you all this
because...

1050
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:03,248
I've grown very fond of you--
like a son, in fact--

1051
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:06,084
and I don't want
to see you get hurt.

1052
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:09,712
The powers here,
and the baileys,

1053
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:12,757
they're ruthless, Billy.

1054
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:16,136
I think you're beginning
to see some of that.

1055
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:20,182
You've already gone too far.

1056
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:24,436
You're no longer safe here.

1057
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:29,899
When that deficiency bill
comes up in senate tomorrow,

1058
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,192
stay away.

1059
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:34,696
Just stay away.
It's that simple.

1060
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,032
Please.

1061
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,535
Just stay away.

1062
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:57,385
And under previous orders,

1063
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,261
the senate
resumes consideration

1064
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,930
of yesterday's unfinished
business,

1065
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:02,349
which the clerk will read.

1066
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:06,849
A bill, hr7700, providing
for deficiency appropriations

1067
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:11,191
for the fiscal year 1977,
and for other purposes.

1068
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:12,692
The bill is open
to amendments.

1069
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:15,069
- Mr. president.
- Senator Jack.

1070
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,571
Mr. president,
i wish to address myself

1071
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:20,074
to section 40 of the bill.

1072
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:22,577
I want specifically to talk
about the nuclear plant

1073
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,246
- on willett creek.
- Mr. president!

1074
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:26,831
Will the senator yield?

1075
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:31,586
Yes, yes, sir.

1076
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:35,506
Mr. president, I have
risen to a difficult task

1077
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:39,886
to say that out of evidence
that has come to my attention,

1078
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:44,181
I consider senator Jack
unworthy to address this body.

1079
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,482
Order in the senate!

1080
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,905
The chair will clear the gallery
unless order is restored.

1081
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:01,532
- What in the hell is going on?
- I don't know.

1082
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:04,285
Payne's jumping Billy Jack
about something.

1083
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:05,662
Proceed, sir.

1084
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:09,624
I have hesitated to speak,
but in all conscience I must.

1085
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:13,794
It is a charge as grave
as has ever been made

1086
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,839
from this floor
against a fellow member.

1087
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:20,260
I refer to the bill he has
presented in this chamber,

1088
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:23,137
providing for his
national youth camp.

1089
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:26,266
Senators,

1090
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:30,766
I have conclusive
evidence to prove

1091
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:34,315
that my colleague
owns the very land

1092
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,234
described in his bill.

1093
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:43,867
He bought it the day following
his appointment to the senate,

1094
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:47,954
and he is holding it,
using this body

1095
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:52,454
and his privileged position
for his own personal profit.

1096
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,836
- Tonto had a racket?
- It doesn't make sense!

1097
01:01:55,837 --> 01:02:00,337
Accordingly,
i offer a resolution

1098
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:04,554
for an immediate inquiry
by the select committee

1099
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:09,054
on standards and conduct as
to the fitness of my colleague

1100
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:13,354
to continue to sit
in this chamber.

1101
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:30,330
Order, the committee calls
governor hopper, please.

1102
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:32,498
Governor hopper.

1103
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:33,416
Governor,

1104
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:37,503
were you there the morning that
Mr. Allen was present?

1105
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:40,048
Ah, yes Mr. chairman,
i was present the morning

1106
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:42,341
that Kenneth Allen
came to the state capital,

1107
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:46,679
bringing proof that Billy Jack
had a deed to that campsite.

1108
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,516
I, uh, frankly was
in a state of shock.

1109
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:51,184
I mean, Billy Jack
of all people.

1110
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:53,561
He is a hero to people
all over my state.

1111
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:56,021
Now, governor, what did you do

1112
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:58,357
when Mr. Allen brought this
to your attention?

1113
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:00,943
Ah, I had a consultation with
the head of the department

1114
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:03,696
of records, Mr. Arthur Kim.

1115
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:07,575
Mr. Kim, do you remember
recording this deed?

1116
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:10,411
Yes.

1117
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:13,081
On the date set forth here?

1118
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:16,292
Mr. Kenneth Allen came
before me to record this deed,

1119
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:20,255
setting over these 400 acres
in the name of Billy Jack.

1120
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:25,050
Order, please.

1121
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:28,721
How long have you known
senator Jack, Mr. Allen?

1122
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:30,724
Oh, many, many years.

1123
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:33,393
He often camped
around willett creek.

1124
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:37,063
Now, a lot of people were afraid
of Billy Jack, but I liked him.

1125
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:39,148
And then when he came to me
with this proposition--

1126
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:42,110
what proposition,
please, Mr. Allen?

1127
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:45,571
Well, he said he had a chance
to sell that leased land

1128
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:48,157
for at least five thousand
dollars an acre.

1129
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:51,077
Me, I was happy to get
five hundred dollars an acre.

1130
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:55,247
So, we set it up like this:
I deeded him the land,

1131
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,917
and he gave me a contract
guaranteeing me

1132
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:01,629
half of what he got
if he made the sale.

1133
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:04,465
Well, in a way, it sounded
kind of fishy at the time,

1134
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:08,052
but that's the way most
of these developers work.

1135
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:10,138
So it wasn't until he sent me
this telegram

1136
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:13,266
that I realized there was some
really dirty business going on.

1137
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,268
May we see the telegram,
please?

1138
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:17,270
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1139
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:23,859
"Urgent.
Camp bill introduced.

1140
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,862
"Senator Payne will help.

1141
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,738
"You have a deal on that land.

1142
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:29,657
"Contracts to follow.

1143
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:30,991
Billy Jack."

1144
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:35,163
Order, please.

1145
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:39,000
That contract you mentioned,
have you got that document?

1146
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,836
That land wouldn't be in his
name if I didn't, yes, sir.

1147
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,587
Signed, sealed,
and delivered.

1148
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:48,842
Order, please.

1149
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:51,720
After a long study
of this signature,

1150
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:55,683
it is my professional opinion
that it definitely is

1151
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:57,810
Billy Jack's
own handwriting.

1152
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:04,942
Therefore, it is my opinion
as a professional,

1153
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:08,488
and as an expert
on handwriting,

1154
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:11,324
that the signature
of Billy Jack

1155
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:14,952
on this contract
is a forgery.

1156
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:24,958
It is difficult to tell the real
thing and a clever forgery,

1157
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,840
and you'll get differing
opinions from experts,

1158
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:31,511
but I'd be willing to stake
my 40 years in this profession

1159
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:34,055
on the fact that this
is not a forgery

1160
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:37,975
and is the actual signature
of Billy Jack.

1161
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:46,275
Mr. chairman, gentlemen...

1162
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:53,654
This is an excruciatingly
painful duty for me.

1163
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:59,830
This young boy

1164
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:02,750
is the nephew
of my very dearest friend.

1165
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:08,839
I sponsored him
in the senate.

1166
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:13,340
I helped him
frame his camp bill.

1167
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:17,765
And when he presented it
to the senate,

1168
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:21,977
I went over
to congratulate him,

1169
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:25,606
but I pointed out
to him that

1170
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:30,107
a nuclear plant was going up
on the very site

1171
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:33,447
he had selected for his camp.

1172
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:37,948
I said there are hundreds of
equally good campsites nearby.

1173
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:42,206
I suggested that he

1174
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:46,628
choose another site
for his camp.

1175
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:49,464
He got furious.

1176
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:52,467
He said "move the plant."

1177
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:54,886
I had heard about
his violent temper,

1178
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:59,386
but I was amazed
at his reaction.

1179
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:02,476
He began to argue with me.

1180
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:06,977
He said that "unless
i get that very same site,

1181
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,901
"i will attack
the willett creek plant.

1182
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:14,401
I'll charge graft,
political motives."

1183
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:21,324
He would use anything he could
think of to defeat it.

1184
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:25,999
Well, faced with that,
gentlemen...

1185
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:32,586
In spite of my very deep
personal feelings for the boy...

1186
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,177
My sense of duty...

1187
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:42,846
Required that his expulsion
from the senate

1188
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:46,145
would be the only
acceptable solution.

1189
01:07:54,654 --> 01:07:56,822
Senator Jack, please.

1190
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:11,462
The committee is ready for your
testimony now, senator Jack.

1191
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:41,534
Order!
Order in this courtroom!

1192
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:44,245
That's it.
He's drawn and quartered.

1193
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:46,830
You know, I didn't think
he was guilty until this moment.

1194
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:02,930
We'll get the whole thing
over all the front pages.

1195
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:06,224
Yeah, we'll be sending some
photos for the TV coverage.

1196
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:09,561
Listen, make sure you give Joe
Payne a big buildup, will ya?

1197
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:13,732
Yeah, sort of an "Abraham
sacrificing his son

1198
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:16,068
for the good of the people"
sort of thing.

1199
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:19,906
Yeah, sure, they're having
a hell of a time.

1200
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,907
You'll never guess
who I found.

1201
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:07,078
Saunders.

1202
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:11,040
And guess what she found
in her safety deposit box.

1203
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:16,462
All of foley's
classified material.

1204
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:23,427
She's willing to come back and
make a fight of it if you are.

1205
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:26,013
To make a fight of what?

1206
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:28,765
- You mean you're gonna quit?
- Who's the enemy?

1207
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:32,102
I don't even know who
I'm supposed to be fighting.

1208
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:34,730
Look, Billy, who better
than you knows that

1209
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:37,734
you can't reform congress
from within?

1210
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:40,194
So why don't you use
the filibuster

1211
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:41,445
as a way to teach people

1212
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:45,946
how they can get
a national referendum?

1213
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:49,579
Even if you lose,
who cares?

1214
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:50,746
You'll have taught people

1215
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,665
how to get around
a corrupt congress.

1216
01:10:56,961 --> 01:11:01,215
Your quitting is sure gonna
shatter a lot of hopes, though.

1217
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:04,593
Well, I'm sorry about that.

1218
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:06,804
But this is different.
Lt's-- lt's--

1219
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,057
it's just too sophisticated.

1220
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:15,812
Maybe you're right.

1221
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:18,732
Maybe if the only solution
you have to crucial problems

1222
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:23,233
is to take off your boots
and kick people in the head,

1223
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:25,531
maybe you
just should go home.

1224
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:46,089
"L have sworn
upon the altar of god

1225
01:11:46,928 --> 01:11:51,098
"eternal hostility

1226
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:55,598
"against every form
of tyranny

1227
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:59,148
over the mind of man."

1228
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:22,064
<i>That we here,
highly resolve</i>

1229
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:25,567
<i>that this nation shall,
under god,</i>

1230
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:28,654
<i>have a new birth of freedom.</i>

1231
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:30,989
<i>And that government
of the people,</i>

1232
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:34,994
<i>by the people,
and for the people</i>

1233
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:37,746
<i>shall not perish
from the earth.</i>

1234
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,075
Senate will come to order.

1235
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:17,078
Clerk will call the roll.

1236
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:19,246
Well, we've got a full house
today, haven't we?

1237
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:21,790
Yup, they always turn out
for the execution.

1238
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:23,501
Hi, Ralph.
- Hi, sweeney.

1239
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:25,252
They expel senator Jack
today, huh?

1240
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:27,629
Well, where are the drums,
the guillotine?

1241
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:29,173
In fact,
where's senator Jack?

1242
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:30,424
I guess he hasn't stopped
running

1243
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:32,509
since he left
that committee room.

1244
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:33,761
Hey Ralph, by the way,

1245
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:35,596
what are you saving
the two seats for?

1246
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:38,390
I don't know.
Jean asked me to hold them.

1247
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:41,060
- Mr. hyrim.
- Here.

1248
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:42,561
- Mr. Jack.
- Here!

1249
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:47,608
You know, that guy
is either crazy

1250
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:49,818
- or a glutton for punishment.
- Maybe both.

1251
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:58,869
- What's Saunders doing here?
- Saunders!

1252
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:01,538
- I thought she left--
- what's Saunders doing in town?

1253
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:04,208
- Where have you been?
- Hi, guys.

1254
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:07,211
Saunders, are you behind
these shenanigans?

1255
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:09,630
- Me?
- What shenanigans?

1256
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:14,218
- Mr. Zimmerman.
- Here.

1257
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:16,261
The quorum is present.

1258
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:17,721
The quorum is present.

1259
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:21,142
- Mr. president?
- Senator Brighton?

1260
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:23,894
Mr. president, on behalf
of the select committee

1261
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:25,896
on standards and conduct,

1262
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:29,649
I send to the desk a report
of that committee

1263
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:32,110
on the investigation
of senator Billy Jack

1264
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:35,155
as unanimously directed
by the committee.

1265
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:38,033
I also report an original
resolution

1266
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:42,038
for the senator's expulsion,
which I ask to be read.

1267
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:44,081
Without objection?

1268
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:51,296
So ordered.

1269
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:53,674
Whereas it has been shown,
by the investigation

1270
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:56,510
of the select committee
of standards and conduct,

1271
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:59,679
that senator Billy Jack,
as United States senator,

1272
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:02,808
did engage in a course
of unethical conduct

1273
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:07,062
calculated to benefit his own
personal and financial worth,

1274
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:09,857
and whereas such conduct
derogates from the public trust

1275
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:12,150
expected of a senator,
and brings the senate

1276
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:15,154
into contumely disrepute
and dishonor,

1277
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:17,906
resolved that it is
the judgment of the senate

1278
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:21,285
that senator Billy Jack
be, and hereby is,

1279
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:24,079
expelled from
the United States senate.

1280
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,999
Mr. president, I move
the immediate adoption

1281
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:30,419
of the resolution and ask
for all the yays and nays.

1282
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:31,962
- Stand up!
- Mr. president!

1283
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:33,755
Mr. president,
i have the floor,

1284
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:35,507
and am about
to ask for a roll call

1285
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:36,759
on the passing of
this resolution

1286
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:38,177
without any further delay.

1287
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:41,346
Mr. president, I believe i
addressed the chair first, sir.

1288
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:43,307
The senator can say nothing
at this time

1289
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:45,684
that would not be
in bad grace, sir.

1290
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:48,978
Senator Jack is still
a member of this body

1291
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:53,479
and as such, has equal claim
to the attention of this chair.

1292
01:16:53,818 --> 01:16:55,861
You were about
to recognize me, sir.

1293
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:58,905
That is merely
your assumption, senator.

1294
01:16:58,906 --> 01:17:01,491
Let him speak!

1295
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:12,127
Before I proceed further,
i would like to say

1296
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:15,297
to the visitors that they
are here as our guests,

1297
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,882
and they should conduct
themselves as such,

1298
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:22,383
and we might add that
such crudely-voiced sentiments

1299
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:26,600
will in no way affect
the judgment of this chair.

1300
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:34,062
The chair recognizes...
Senator Jack.

1301
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:39,988
Thank you sir.

1302
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:41,907
Hold on to your hat,
Jean, here we go.

1303
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:46,077
Well, gentlemen, I guess
you're in a pretty tall hurry

1304
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:48,830
to get me out of here,

1305
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:51,166
and from the way the evidence
is piled up against me,

1306
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:53,961
I can't say
that I blame you much.

1307
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:56,088
And I'm perfectly willing
to go, Mr. president,

1308
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:58,799
as soon as this group
has legally voted that way,

1309
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:01,426
but before I go,

1310
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:04,972
there are some things that
i want to say to this body.

1311
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:07,432
Mr. president,
will the senator yield?

1312
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:08,767
No!

1313
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:11,102
No, senator,
i will not yield.

1314
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:13,313
Now, I yielded once before,
and if you'll recall,

1315
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:14,940
I ended up
being splattered

1316
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,983
across the headline of every
newspaper in this country

1317
01:18:16,984 --> 01:18:18,902
and was practically
never heard of again.

1318
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:22,489
And incidentally, gentlemen,

1319
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:24,115
we might as well
all get together

1320
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:26,868
on this yielding business
right now.

1321
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:29,705
You see, I had some pretty
good coaching last night,

1322
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:33,792
and I found out that if I yield
only for a personal privilege,

1323
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:36,169
a point of order,
or a question,

1324
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:38,130
I can hold this floor
till doomsday,

1325
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:42,175
or at least as long as I can
stand on my own two feet.

1326
01:18:42,176 --> 01:18:44,344
In other words,
Mr. president,

1327
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:47,139
I have a piece to speak,
and come hell or high water,

1328
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:49,641
I am going to stand
on this floor and speak it.

1329
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:51,852
Mr. president,
will the senator yield?

1330
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:54,813
- Will senator Jack yield?
- Yield how?

1331
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:56,981
Will he yield for a question?

1332
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:58,984
For a question, yes,
for a question.

1333
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:01,820
I wish to ask
my junior colleague,

1334
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:04,823
this piece he
intends to speak,

1335
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:07,492
does it concern
section 40 of the bill?

1336
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:09,995
- It does.
- Every aspect of this matter

1337
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:12,080
was dealt with during
the committee hearings.

1338
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:13,749
- Mr. president--
- I wish to ask

1339
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:17,419
my distinguished colleague,
has he one scrap of evidence

1340
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:20,547
to add now to the defense,
that he did not give

1341
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:22,507
and could not give
during that same hearing?

1342
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:24,510
There are no defenses
against forged papers,

1343
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:25,677
and you know it,
senator Payne.

1344
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:28,180
The committee ruled otherwise!

1345
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:30,515
The gentleman stands
guilty as charged.

1346
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,351
I stand guilty as framed!

1347
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,728
I believe I speak for
every member present

1348
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:37,021
when I say that no one
cares to hear

1349
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:39,524
what a man of his condemned
character has to say

1350
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:41,860
about any section of any
legislation

1351
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,194
before this house!

1352
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:45,572
Mr. president,
i was guilty as framed!

1353
01:19:45,572 --> 01:19:48,366
And I was framed because I was
going to stand up here and tell

1354
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:51,203
that section 40 is nothing
but a nuclear ripoff!

1355
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:53,288
I was going to stand
in this chamber

1356
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:55,916
and tell about a certain
James Bailey back in my state,

1357
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:57,918
who wanted to put that
plant through

1358
01:19:57,918 --> 01:19:59,127
for his own
personal profit.

1359
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:00,879
Mr. president,
will the senator yield?

1360
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:02,922
No, I will not yield!

1361
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:04,883
Now this same James Bailey

1362
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:09,053
promised me a seat in this
chair for the next 20 years

1363
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:11,723
if I went along and voted
for something that he knew

1364
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:14,393
and I knew was a fraud
on the American people.

1365
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:16,603
And he also told me

1366
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:19,063
that if I dared to stand up
in this chamber

1367
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:22,567
and oppose that nuclear plant,
he would break me in two.

1368
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:25,112
All right.
All right, Mr. president,

1369
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:26,780
I stood up the other day,

1370
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:29,991
and I tried to address myself
to section 40,

1371
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:32,244
and the long arm of Mr. Bailey

1372
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:34,454
reached into this sacred
chamber,

1373
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:36,915
and he grabbed me
by the back of the neck!

1374
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:40,293
Mr. president Mr. president!
A point of order.

1375
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:42,629
Mr. president,
do I have the floor?

1376
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:45,173
Senator Payne will state it.

1377
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:49,674
It was I who rose in this
chamber to accuse him.

1378
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:54,178
He is claiming that I was
carrying out criminal orders

1379
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:56,434
and falsified evidence.

1380
01:20:56,435 --> 01:21:00,605
He has imputed to me conduct
unworthy of a senator,

1381
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:03,317
and I demand that he be
made to yield the floor.

1382
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:05,110
Mr. president, I did not say

1383
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,778
that senator Payne
was in that room!

1384
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:08,864
But I was in that room!

1385
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:14,703
Order!

1386
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:19,708
I accuse this man
by his tone,

1387
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:23,128
by his careful denials of
deliberately trying to plant

1388
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:24,963
damaging impressions
of my conduct.

1389
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:28,841
I'll tell you why--
because Mr. Bailey,

1390
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:30,969
a respected citizen
of our state,

1391
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:33,471
had brought with him
the evidence against this man,

1392
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:36,308
and we were urging Billy Jack
to resign.

1393
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:39,978
Why?
To avoid bringing disgrace

1394
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:41,813
upon a clean
and honorable state,

1395
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:42,981
and upon this body.

1396
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:45,066
But senator Jack refused.

1397
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:47,652
He threatened
to bring that very disgrace

1398
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:49,529
down upon the state
and all of us present

1399
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:51,823
if we refused
to let him go through

1400
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:53,659
with this contemptible scheme.

1401
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:54,993
- Mr. president--
- finally--

1402
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:57,161
Mr. president,
do I have the floor?

1403
01:21:57,162 --> 01:21:59,414
...there was only one way
to answer this man.

1404
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:03,669
The truth, which I rose
and gave to this body.

1405
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:07,506
Mr. president, he is trying
to blackmail the senate,

1406
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,549
just as he tried
to blackmail me.

1407
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:12,678
To prevent his expulsion,
he would probably even try

1408
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:14,346
to hold up
the deficiency bill,

1409
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:16,014
vital to the entire country,

1410
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:17,849
which must be passed
immediately today.

1411
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:19,184
Do I have the floor?

1412
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:22,228
Gentlemen, I have lost
Patience with this gentleman!

1413
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:25,273
I am sick and tired of this
contemptible young man.

1414
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:27,776
I apologize to this body
for his appointment.

1415
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,235
I regret I ever knew him,

1416
01:22:29,236 --> 01:22:32,697
and I refuse to stay
and listen to him any longer.

1417
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:36,952
And I hope every member
of this chamber feels as I do.

1418
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:49,631
Senators will be in order!

1419
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:51,674
Senators
will address the chair.

1420
01:22:51,675 --> 01:22:54,928
- Mr. president!
- Senator Warner.

1421
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:58,473
Mr. president, what does the
gentleman want of this body?

1422
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:00,142
I'll tell you what I want.

1423
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:02,686
I want one week,
just one week

1424
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:04,729
to bring proof of the charges
into this chamber

1425
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,440
that I brought
against Mr. Bailey.

1426
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,358
And I want the senate
to promise me

1427
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:09,817
that they will not pass the
deficiency bill

1428
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,152
for that one week.

1429
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:12,821
Will the senator yield?

1430
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,572
For a question only.

1431
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:18,285
Has the senator
the effrontery to stand there,

1432
01:23:18,285 --> 01:23:21,288
convicted and in disgrace,

1433
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:23,498
and try to force
the postponement

1434
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:24,833
of this deficiency bill?

1435
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,793
For one lousy week!

1436
01:23:26,793 --> 01:23:29,003
Mr. president,
i appeal to the senator.

1437
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:31,256
Is he fully aware
that this bill

1438
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:33,091
has been months
in both houses,

1439
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:34,509
delayed and delayed--

1440
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:37,888
Mr. president,
if the senate yields

1441
01:23:37,888 --> 01:23:41,182
to this kind of blackmail
at this time, from this man,

1442
01:23:41,183 --> 01:23:43,393
whatever credibility
this body has left

1443
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:45,228
will be totally destroyed.

1444
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:47,689
Mr. president,
it is an insult to this body

1445
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,190
to have to listen.

1446
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:52,444
An insult to our colleague
senator Payne.

1447
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:55,905
And I, for one, will follow
the senator's example

1448
01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:58,950
and refuse to remain
in this chamber

1449
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:02,996
as long as that man
holds the floor.

1450
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:15,508
President: Senator Jack.

1451
01:24:15,509 --> 01:24:18,303
Looks like I'm just going
to have to present my case

1452
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:20,138
from this floor,
Mr. president--

1453
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:22,765
that is, if you ladies
and gentlemen of the press

1454
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:25,769
will carry my remarks
accurately.

1455
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:31,065
In other words, sir,
wild horses are not going

1456
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:32,650
to drag me off of this floor

1457
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:34,235
until I've at least
had the opportunity

1458
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:36,738
to present my evidence
to the people of my state,

1459
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:38,906
and I don't care
if that takes me

1460
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:40,241
for the rest of this year.

1461
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:42,410
Filibuster!

1462
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:43,662
Filibuster!

1463
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:55,340
Joe, get this.
Billy Jack on the floor,

1464
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:56,841
just as they were ready
to throw him out,

1465
01:24:56,842 --> 01:24:57,968
and he's holding it!

1466
01:24:57,968 --> 01:25:00,971
Filibuster. Billy Jack is
filibustering the senate.

1467
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:03,139
Listen, you've got to get me
everything he's saying

1468
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:04,307
to the networks, okay?

1469
01:25:04,308 --> 01:25:05,475
- Consider it done.
- Thanks.

1470
01:25:05,475 --> 01:25:06,809
When they read my story.

1471
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:09,020
- Oh, Ralph.
- Saunders, I promise you,

1472
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:10,689
they're gonna hear about this
in patagonia!

1473
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:11,856
They'd better!

1474
01:25:11,857 --> 01:25:14,317
The entire senate
got up and walked out!

1475
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:16,653
Oh, Ralph, come on,
that's straight stuff.

1476
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:18,821
You've gotta kick it up
a little bit, get on his side.

1477
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:20,073
Fight for him, huh?

1478
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:22,825
You guys understand
what this is all about, please.

1479
01:25:23,994 --> 01:25:27,163
Joe, scratch all that
and take this.

1480
01:25:27,164 --> 01:25:30,083
The most Titanic
battle of modern times

1481
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:31,584
has broken out in Washington.

1482
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:34,004
A new young David,
without a slingshot,

1483
01:25:34,004 --> 01:25:36,548
has risen to do battle
on the senate floor

1484
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:38,508
with not one mighty goliath
but many.

1485
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:39,800
Oh, Ralph, I love you.

1486
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:44,597
That they are endowed with
certain inalienable rights,

1487
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:48,184
and among them
are life, Liberty,

1488
01:25:48,185 --> 01:25:50,395
and the pursuit of happiness.

1489
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:06,203
Uh, uh, Mr. president--

1490
01:26:06,203 --> 01:26:10,703
Mr. president,
we seem to be alone, sir.

1491
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:13,918
Now, I'm not complaining
for social reasons,

1492
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:18,419
but, uh, I think
it would be a shame

1493
01:26:18,548 --> 01:26:20,299
if these gentlemen
miss the evidence

1494
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,426
that I would like to present,

1495
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:23,719
so I would like
to call your attention

1496
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,972
to the standing rules
of the senate.

1497
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:29,558
Uh, rule 5, section...

1498
01:26:29,559 --> 01:26:31,644
Section 3.

1499
01:26:31,645 --> 01:26:36,145
Sir, it says,
and I'm quoting now,

1500
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:41,738
"lf a quorum shall not
be found to be present,

1501
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:44,782
"then a majority
of the senators present

1502
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:48,244
"may direct the sergeant
of arms to request,

1503
01:26:48,245 --> 01:26:51,498
"and if necessary to compel,

1504
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:54,334
the attendance
of the absent senators."

1505
01:26:54,334 --> 01:26:55,793
Unquote.

1506
01:26:55,794 --> 01:27:00,294
Uh, Mr. president, I guess it
looks like I am the majority,

1507
01:27:01,425 --> 01:27:05,679
so... I so compel.

1508
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:09,808
Well, in the absence
of a quorum, being suggested,

1509
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:12,143
clerk will call the role.

1510
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:14,938
Bailey: Now where the hell
is that long distance call?

1511
01:27:14,938 --> 01:27:16,481
Assistant:
We're trying to get it.

1512
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:20,151
Will you do me a favor and get
more direct lines out of here?

1513
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:21,820
Chick, have you got
hold of Hendrix?

1514
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:22,987
They're looking for him.

1515
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:24,155
Looking for him?

1516
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:25,824
Now, look, why the hell
isn't an editor

1517
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:27,575
at his desk where he belongs?

1518
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:30,828
Joe.

1519
01:27:32,539 --> 01:27:35,208
Joe, why aren't you
on the senate floor?

1520
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:37,543
Jim, that boy is talking
to the state now,

1521
01:27:37,544 --> 01:27:38,711
the whole country.

1522
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:40,380
- The story is out.
- So what?

1523
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:42,048
The fight is out in the open,
that's all.

1524
01:27:42,048 --> 01:27:43,466
That's what I mean.

1525
01:27:43,467 --> 01:27:45,552
If he can turn public opinion
against us,

1526
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:47,512
if any part of this sticks--

1527
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:49,388
he won't even get started.

1528
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:52,392
I'll make public opinion
out there in five hours.

1529
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:53,976
I've done it all my life.

1530
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:57,063
Now look, will you leave
public opinion to me, Joe?

1531
01:27:57,063 --> 01:27:59,023
Now go on, get back
to the senate there

1532
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:01,401
and keep those honorable
gentlemen in line.

1533
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:04,362
Jim, I hit him from the floor
with everything I know.

1534
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:06,906
I don't have the stomach
for it anymore.

1535
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:09,075
Now you listen to me, Joe.

1536
01:28:09,075 --> 01:28:13,162
If he starts to convince
those senators,

1537
01:28:13,163 --> 01:28:15,748
you might just as well
blow your brains out,

1538
01:28:15,749 --> 01:28:18,585
because this is it,
the whole works.

1539
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:22,171
We've got to smash that guy
and bury him.

1540
01:28:22,172 --> 01:28:26,092
Mcghan:
Jim, Hendrix on line 4.

1541
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:28,052
Go on back to the senate, Joe.

1542
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:29,179
Go on.

1543
01:28:30,764 --> 01:28:33,266
Now where the hell
have you been?

1544
01:28:33,266 --> 01:28:34,892
All right, never mind.

1545
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:38,104
Look, I want you to line up
every newspaper, TV,

1546
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:40,189
and radio station
in the state.

1547
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:42,734
I want you to call in
all the lous.

1548
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:45,903
Yeah, I want them to keep
everything Billy Jack says

1549
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:47,113
out of the media.

1550
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:48,364
Defend the party.

1551
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:49,783
What do you mean with what?

1552
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:52,202
He's a criminal,
convicted by the senate,

1553
01:28:52,202 --> 01:28:53,953
and now blocking
the relief bill

1554
01:28:53,954 --> 01:28:55,205
and starving people.

1555
01:28:55,205 --> 01:28:56,456
He's one of those
crazy radicals

1556
01:28:56,456 --> 01:28:58,875
making a mockery of our courts
and institutions.

1557
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:00,585
With what, he asks.

1558
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:04,213
And buy up every minute
you can of every station

1559
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:05,882
over 2 watts in the state,

1560
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:08,968
and keep those commercials
spouting against him.

1561
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:12,973
Look, I don't give a damn what
your problems are! Just do it!

1562
01:29:12,973 --> 01:29:15,100
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
this can't go on.

1563
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:16,267
It's ridiculous.

1564
01:29:16,268 --> 01:29:17,894
Fantastic.
For one nuclear plant?

1565
01:29:17,894 --> 01:29:19,979
Why don't we throw section 40
out and him with it?

1566
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:21,982
What do you mean?
And repudiate Joe here?

1567
01:29:21,982 --> 01:29:24,651
Henry, you've got to get
that man off the floor.

1568
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:27,278
Come on, boys.
You know as well as I do

1569
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:29,823
as long as Mr. Jack holds
that floor legitimately,

1570
01:29:29,823 --> 01:29:31,157
he's going to hold it.

1571
01:29:31,157 --> 01:29:33,409
And if anyone were to ask me,

1572
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:36,454
I'd say the young fella's
making a lot of sense.

1573
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:40,499
Sense? You call blackmail
sense, Henry?

1574
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:43,127
Look, Joe, I didn't like this
radical from the beginning,

1575
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:44,754
but if the man
weren't Sincere,

1576
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:46,672
how could he stage
such a good fight

1577
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:48,299
against these impossible odds?

1578
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:49,759
Well, that's just fine,
Martin, that's just fine.

1579
01:29:49,759 --> 01:29:51,761
I'm glad to hear that after
20 years of working

1580
01:29:51,761 --> 01:29:54,305
with you fellas, you're ready
to take his word over mine.

1581
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:58,643
...what it means.
If he's just that much right,

1582
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,186
then I'm totally wrong.

1583
01:30:00,186 --> 01:30:01,228
Joe, isn't there just some way

1584
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:02,688
we can get that
nuclear plant out of there,

1585
01:30:02,689 --> 01:30:04,357
just so we can get
the deficiency bill through?

1586
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:06,442
It's not a question
of a nuclear plant.

1587
01:30:06,443 --> 01:30:07,777
It's a question of my honor

1588
01:30:07,777 --> 01:30:09,987
and the integrity
of the select committee.

1589
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:12,365
Yes, and the senate itself.

1590
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:14,283
But if that's what you want
to do, go ahead!

1591
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:15,868
Throw out section 40.

1592
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:18,288
I'll resign from the committee
and we'll be through with it.

1593
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:20,331
Now wait a minute,
wait a minute. Wait, wait.

1594
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:22,292
This is a lot of nonsense.

1595
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:23,501
Now, Joe's right.

1596
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:25,127
A deal is impossible.

1597
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:28,214
We have got to go on the way we
have been doing and break him.

1598
01:30:28,214 --> 01:30:29,715
Keep him talking.

1599
01:30:29,716 --> 01:30:30,967
No relief.

1600
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:32,551
Maintain a watch in relays.

1601
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:36,389
I mean, after all, how long
can a man stand on his legs?

1602
01:30:36,389 --> 01:30:38,391
Is that the way you feel,
John?

1603
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:40,476
For once,
we're in total agreement.

1604
01:30:40,477 --> 01:30:43,646
- Charlie?
- Right, I couldn't agree more.

1605
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:46,900
Gentlemen, time to leave
the man on the floor.

1606
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:53,652
Now tell me, does anybody
in this chamber really--

1607
01:31:00,664 --> 01:31:04,125
I guess we have the night shift
coming on, Mr. president.

1608
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:14,427
Here.

1609
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:15,845
Thank you, Jimmy.

1610
01:31:21,351 --> 01:31:25,851
Oh, Mr. president,
i am very happy to learn

1611
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:28,900
that the senate rules
provide for human frailty

1612
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:32,236
and that I am allowed
under the rules

1613
01:31:32,237 --> 01:31:35,698
a two- or three-minute
break for emergencies.

1614
01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:40,199
Uh, Mr. president, right now,
it is such an emergency.

1615
01:31:46,292 --> 01:31:49,586
Charlie, I want the entire
morning edition front page

1616
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:51,922
nothing but a blast
to shove him off the floor.

1617
01:31:51,923 --> 01:31:53,799
And I want telegrams,
you understand?

1618
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,552
Telegrams pouring in
to senator Payne's office.

1619
01:31:56,553 --> 01:31:58,137
All right,
here's how we do it--

1620
01:31:58,138 --> 01:32:01,224
a convicted thief purportedly
representing you

1621
01:32:01,224 --> 01:32:03,893
has totally crippled
the United States senate.

1622
01:32:03,893 --> 01:32:05,144
You got that?

1623
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:07,730
Billy Jack:
Now we come to the real reason

1624
01:32:07,731 --> 01:32:10,400
senator foley
sealed this file.

1625
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,735
Oh, ugly as the facts are,

1626
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:14,779
but the contributions
and the kickbacks,

1627
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:17,740
that's penny ante stuff
compared to the real reason

1628
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:20,994
that foley classified this
as top-secret.

1629
01:32:20,994 --> 01:32:25,456
No, gentlemen, the real reason
lies here, in this file.

1630
01:32:25,457 --> 01:32:28,251
What does it reveal?
Oh, nothing much--

1631
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:32,751
just the astonishing fact
that over a ten-year period

1632
01:32:33,673 --> 01:32:37,426
at 58 different
nuclear plants,

1633
01:32:37,427 --> 01:32:41,848
there were at least
141 technical mishaps

1634
01:32:41,848 --> 01:32:46,185
that came dangerously close
to a complete meltdown.

1635
01:32:46,186 --> 01:32:50,190
Now let me put that for you
in another way, gentlemen.

1636
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:53,610
All the while that the nuclear
regulatory commission

1637
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:56,487
was pointing to
three mile island as proof

1638
01:32:56,488 --> 01:32:58,615
of the safety
of their program--

1639
01:32:58,615 --> 01:33:01,618
after all,
no one got killed, right?--

1640
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:03,953
and was assuring us under oath

1641
01:33:03,953 --> 01:33:07,539
that it was a freak accident
that could never happen again,

1642
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:12,040
they had, in their possession,
here in foley's file,

1643
01:33:12,462 --> 01:33:15,965
full knowledge that there
was an accident

1644
01:33:15,965 --> 01:33:19,009
on the average
of at least once a month,

1645
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:23,510
each and every month,
for the last ten years.

1646
01:33:23,807 --> 01:33:27,352
Each accident of which
came dangerously close,

1647
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:31,481
sometimes within-- within
even hours to a meltdown

1648
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:34,859
that was similar or worse to
the one at three mile island,

1649
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:37,528
and any one of which
could have destroyed

1650
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:41,199
the entire community
that the plant was located in.

1651
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:45,699
Hey, but Mr. Bailey
and all of your Mr. baileys

1652
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:48,748
are gonna make huge profits.

1653
01:33:48,748 --> 01:33:51,584
So the nuclear regulatory
commission

1654
01:33:51,584 --> 01:33:55,170
lies through its teeth
to the American people,

1655
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:59,671
and you gentlemen,
you swear to it.

1656
01:34:21,114 --> 01:34:23,533
Saunders, Jean,
you better wake up.

1657
01:34:23,533 --> 01:34:24,617
You guys are in trouble.

1658
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:25,909
What?

1659
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:28,203
Brady's column, too.
I can't believe it!

1660
01:34:28,204 --> 01:34:29,705
What are you talking about?

1661
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:32,208
You better call your boy off,
Jean. He's getting nowhere.

1662
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:33,709
- Why?
- It's murder.

1663
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:35,753
Almost nothing of what he's
saying is being printed

1664
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:37,546
or heard back
in your home state.

1665
01:34:37,547 --> 01:34:39,423
- What?
- Brady's column, radio,

1666
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:40,925
wire service,
television stations,

1667
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:42,801
everything has been scratched.

1668
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:44,762
How in the hell
can they do that?

1669
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:46,722
Well, so now in the meantime,

1670
01:34:46,723 --> 01:34:48,141
all of Bailey's
stations and friends

1671
01:34:48,141 --> 01:34:49,725
are pouring out
the party line, right?

1672
01:34:49,726 --> 01:34:51,394
Better believe it.
He's got demonstrators

1673
01:34:51,394 --> 01:34:53,813
coming out of party headquarters
in every corner of that state.

1674
01:34:53,813 --> 01:34:56,857
And that's what you'd call
freedom of the press, right?

1675
01:35:06,075 --> 01:35:07,701
It's just not fair.

1676
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:08,994
How do you stand it here?

1677
01:35:08,995 --> 01:35:10,204
Jean, Jean, come on.

1678
01:35:10,205 --> 01:35:12,081
No, I'm not gonna come on.

1679
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:15,292
Saunders, telephone.

1680
01:35:15,293 --> 01:35:18,546
One simple little tool

1681
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,506
could turn this government

1682
01:35:20,506 --> 01:35:23,634
back into being a government
of the people

1683
01:35:23,635 --> 01:35:27,221
instead of a government
of corporations,

1684
01:35:27,222 --> 01:35:31,722
and that tool is
the national initiative.

1685
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:33,102
Well...

1686
01:35:36,356 --> 01:35:37,774
What is it, Saunders?

1687
01:35:37,774 --> 01:35:39,442
Tell Billy to stop.

1688
01:35:39,442 --> 01:35:41,610
He's beat, Jean.

1689
01:35:41,611 --> 01:35:44,488
They just busted up
your TV station

1690
01:35:44,489 --> 01:35:46,657
and cut your
transmitting cable.

1691
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:59,416
Greed,
greed exists in all of us.

1692
01:36:01,047 --> 01:36:05,547
And the whole purpose
of the constitution

1693
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:07,845
is to protect the people

1694
01:36:07,845 --> 01:36:12,345
that we are sent here
to represent from our greed.

1695
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:18,602
Then, if we're really gonna have
a representative government,

1696
01:36:21,567 --> 01:36:26,067
we have to give people back
the tool...

1697
01:36:28,283 --> 01:36:32,620
So that is we fail
to protect their rights,

1698
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:37,120
they can protect
their rights...

1699
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:39,794
By a national initiative.

1700
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:44,294
For a right without
the tool to remedy it

1701
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:48,802
is no right at all.

1702
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:50,137
Well--

1703
01:36:50,138 --> 01:36:53,224
Jean, he's killing himself
for nothing.

1704
01:36:53,224 --> 01:36:55,476
Stop him.

1705
01:36:55,476 --> 01:36:57,853
I can't make him stop.

1706
01:36:57,854 --> 01:37:02,354
Mr. president,
will the senator yield?

1707
01:37:04,485 --> 01:37:07,779
Yield how, senator Payne?

1708
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:09,156
For a question.

1709
01:37:09,157 --> 01:37:12,285
Will the senator yield
to his colleague?

1710
01:37:12,285 --> 01:37:15,162
For a question.

1711
01:37:15,163 --> 01:37:19,663
Yes, yes, senator Payne,
I'll yield for a question.

1712
01:37:20,793 --> 01:37:23,128
The senator
has repeatedly stated

1713
01:37:23,129 --> 01:37:27,591
that he is speaking
to the people of our state.

1714
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:31,345
He is waiting, as he
so fancifully put it,

1715
01:37:31,346 --> 01:37:34,515
for them to come marching
here in droves.

1716
01:37:34,515 --> 01:37:37,017
Would the senator
be interested in knowing

1717
01:37:37,018 --> 01:37:39,603
what the people
of our state are saying?

1718
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:46,690
Oh, you bet, senator Payne.
You bet I would.

1719
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:51,361
Mr. president, have I permission
to bring into this chamber

1720
01:37:51,407 --> 01:37:55,907
evidence of the response
of the people of my state?

1721
01:37:55,995 --> 01:37:58,497
Is there any objection?

1722
01:37:58,498 --> 01:38:00,374
No.

1723
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:02,418
You may proceed.

1724
01:38:02,418 --> 01:38:03,836
Pages.

1725
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:07,256
All of you, please.

1726
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:36,160
There it is, gentlemen.

1727
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,828
The gentleman's answer.

1728
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:42,208
Letters, telegrams--
50,000 of them--

1729
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:46,045
demanding
that he yield this floor.

1730
01:38:46,045 --> 01:38:50,507
I invite the senate
to read them.

1731
01:38:50,508 --> 01:38:53,886
I invite my colleague
to read them.

1732
01:38:53,886 --> 01:38:57,973
The people's answer
to Billy Jack!

1733
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:21,724
Well...

1734
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:28,730
I guess this looks like...

1735
01:40:30,608 --> 01:40:33,152
Just another lost cause.

1736
01:40:37,532 --> 01:40:41,327
You people,
you people up there

1737
01:40:41,327 --> 01:40:44,663
wouldn't know about
lost causes.

1738
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:48,918
But Mr. Payne does.

1739
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:53,464
He once told me

1740
01:40:53,464 --> 01:40:56,300
that the only causes
worth fighting for

1741
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:58,010
were the lost causes.

1742
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:04,224
And he fought for them once...

1743
01:41:04,225 --> 01:41:08,229
For the only reason that any
man ever fights for them--

1744
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:13,859
because there's this burning
thing in here...

1745
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:20,570
That says no matter
how great your defects...

1746
01:41:20,575 --> 01:41:24,203
How bad your faults or how
many mistakes you've made...

1747
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:30,413
You've got to try to live
your life by a simple rule--

1748
01:41:31,586 --> 01:41:35,339
just to love your neighbor
as much as yourself.

1749
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:38,258
You've forgotten all that,
haven't you, senator?

1750
01:41:38,259 --> 01:41:42,263
It's part of the great
political campaign speeches.

1751
01:41:42,263 --> 01:41:44,723
Or the crap
you tell young senators

1752
01:41:44,724 --> 01:41:46,934
who come in here believing.

1753
01:41:46,934 --> 01:41:49,645
Believing in everything
they read in the history books

1754
01:41:49,645 --> 01:41:51,772
about this great body
the senate.

1755
01:41:58,195 --> 01:42:00,280
You think I'm licked,
don't you?

1756
01:42:00,281 --> 01:42:02,866
You all think I'm licked, huh?

1757
01:42:02,867 --> 01:42:05,452
Why, because Payne's
guardian angel

1758
01:42:05,453 --> 01:42:07,830
can manufacture overnight

1759
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:10,499
all this phony letter
campaign?

1760
01:42:10,499 --> 01:42:11,666
Huh?

1761
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:14,003
This?

1762
01:42:14,003 --> 01:42:15,462
Here, you read it.

1763
01:42:15,463 --> 01:42:17,006
Go ahead, Mr. majority leader,

1764
01:42:17,006 --> 01:42:18,340
why don't you guys
read this stuff?

1765
01:42:18,341 --> 01:42:19,300
You read it.

1766
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:20,843
Here, all of ya!

1767
01:42:24,305 --> 01:42:26,390
I mean, you know how
to manufacture that stuff

1768
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:28,809
every time you want to run
for re-election.

1769
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:30,977
Every time you want
to stuff a nuclear plant

1770
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:31,979
down people's throat,

1771
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:33,480
then you know how
to manufacture that stuff

1772
01:42:33,481 --> 01:42:35,900
with your Madison Avenue
boys overnight!

1773
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:38,319
And then once you get inside
this chamber,

1774
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:41,071
you forget all about it
until the next six years!

1775
01:42:47,787 --> 01:42:48,788
Y.-

1776
01:42:50,247 --> 01:42:54,209
you think that just because

1777
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:58,255
you come marching in here
with all these lies

1778
01:42:58,255 --> 01:43:00,757
that I'm gonna quit?

1779
01:43:00,758 --> 01:43:02,926
I mean, senator,
i don't care--

1780
01:43:02,927 --> 01:43:05,346
I don't care
if all of the baileys,

1781
01:43:05,346 --> 01:43:08,932
all of your baileys,
come marching in here

1782
01:43:08,933 --> 01:43:11,852
with all their armies
and all the national guards

1783
01:43:11,852 --> 01:43:16,352
and you fill this chamber
with lies!

1784
01:43:18,693 --> 01:43:22,363
And, senator, that's
all they are is lies!

1785
01:43:25,366 --> 01:43:29,203
I am gonna stand
on this floor,

1786
01:43:29,203 --> 01:43:33,703
and I am gonna fight
for this lost cause

1787
01:43:33,916 --> 01:43:36,376
until the people rise up

1788
01:43:36,377 --> 01:43:38,504
and get rid of your
party conventions

1789
01:43:38,504 --> 01:43:40,464
and your political machines

1790
01:43:40,464 --> 01:43:42,799
and once again have a voice

1791
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:46,637
through their own national
initiative.

1792
01:43:46,637 --> 01:43:49,556
Because you see, those of us--

1793
01:43:49,557 --> 01:43:53,227
those of us
who know that simple rule,

1794
01:43:53,227 --> 01:43:56,230
to try to deal fairly
and honestly and justly,

1795
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:57,314
even with the little guy,

1796
01:43:57,314 --> 01:43:58,648
with the little man out there

1797
01:43:58,649 --> 01:44:01,318
who doesn't have
a party machine or a Bailey--

1798
01:44:01,318 --> 01:44:04,904
those of us have
a sacred trust, Mr. Payne.

1799
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:07,407
And you once had
that scared trust.

1800
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:13,660
And you also know that the men
that live by that rule...

1801
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:20,166
Are willing to die
for those lost causes.

1802
01:44:20,379 --> 01:44:24,424
Just as that man we both
once loved...

1803
01:44:24,425 --> 01:44:26,009
Died for his.

1804
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:29,346
Remember that,
slumped over his desk,

1805
01:44:29,346 --> 01:44:32,307
with a bullet in his back.

1806
01:44:32,308 --> 01:44:34,560
You remember that,
senator Payne?

1807
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:40,399
Well...

1808
01:44:44,528 --> 01:44:46,988
I'm gonna stay here,

1809
01:44:46,989 --> 01:44:50,367
and I'm gonna fight
for this lost cause.

1810
01:45:03,672 --> 01:45:05,382
Can I please..

1811
01:45:08,344 --> 01:45:10,262
Can I have a drink of water?

1812
01:45:14,391 --> 01:45:15,683
Billy!

1813
01:45:19,271 --> 01:45:20,981
Get a medical in here!

1814
01:46:13,701 --> 01:46:16,412
Mr. president!
Mr. president!

1815
01:46:16,412 --> 01:46:19,206
What is the pending business
before the senate?

1816
01:46:19,206 --> 01:46:22,584
The question before
the senate is the motion

1817
01:46:22,585 --> 01:46:24,628
to adopt the senator's
resolution

1818
01:46:24,628 --> 01:46:28,214
on the expulsion
of senator Billy Jack.

1819
01:46:28,215 --> 01:46:32,715
Mr. president,
i insist upon my motion,

1820
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:36,473
and I demand
the yays and nays.

1821
01:47:03,876 --> 01:47:06,169
No! No! No! No! No!

1822
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:08,505
No! No! No! No! No!

1823
01:47:08,505 --> 01:47:10,882
No! No! No! No! No!

1824
01:47:10,883 --> 01:47:13,176
No! No! No! No! No!

1825
01:47:13,177 --> 01:47:15,596
No! No! No! No! No!

1826
01:47:15,596 --> 01:47:17,931
No! No! No! No! No!

1827
01:47:17,932 --> 01:47:20,267
No! No! No! No! No!

1828
01:47:20,267 --> 01:47:22,644
No! No! No! No! No!

1829
01:47:22,645 --> 01:47:24,772
No! No! No! No! No!

1830
01:47:24,772 --> 01:47:27,316
No! No! No! No! No!

1831
01:47:27,316 --> 01:47:29,609
No! No! No! No! No!

1832
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:32,029
No! No! No! No! No!

1833
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:34,322
No! No! No! No! No!

1834
01:47:34,323 --> 01:47:36,575
No! No! No! No! No!

1835
01:47:36,575 --> 01:47:38,952
No! No! No! No! No!

1836
01:47:38,953 --> 01:47:41,205
No! No! No! No! No!

1837
01:47:41,205 --> 01:47:43,665
No! No! No! No! No!

1838
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:45,751
No! No! No! No! No!

1839
01:48:26,834 --> 01:48:28,460
You did it.

1840
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:32,422
So, no matter what they do
to you now, you did it.

1841
01:48:32,423 --> 01:48:35,843
And you didn't even have to
once take off your boots.

1842
01:48:52,234 --> 01:48:54,277
The clerk will read
the resolution.

1843
01:48:54,278 --> 01:48:58,778
By title, for the information
of the senate.

1844
01:48:58,991 --> 01:49:01,451
Senate resolution 336

1845
01:49:01,452 --> 01:49:04,455
calling for the expulsion
of senator Billy Jack.

1846
01:49:04,455 --> 01:49:06,665
The yays and nays
are requested

1847
01:49:06,665 --> 01:49:08,333
for the adoption
of the resolution.

1848
01:49:08,333 --> 01:49:10,626
Is there a sufficient second?

1849
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:14,923
No.

1850
01:49:14,923 --> 01:49:18,551
Obviously, there's
a sufficient number.

1851
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:20,512
Clerk will call the roll.

1852
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:22,013
No, he's--

1853
01:49:22,014 --> 01:49:25,475
I didn't quite get
your remarks, senator Payne.

1854
01:49:25,476 --> 01:49:28,729
No! No!

1855
01:49:28,729 --> 01:49:31,148
Expel me, not him!

1856
01:49:31,148 --> 01:49:33,358
I am not fit to be a senator.

1857
01:49:33,358 --> 01:49:36,861
Everything he said about the
willett creek project is true.

1858
01:49:36,862 --> 01:49:38,655
It is a fraud.
It's a crime.

1859
01:49:38,655 --> 01:49:40,823
It's a crime against
the people of the state

1860
01:49:40,824 --> 01:49:42,867
that sent me here,
and I committed it.

1861
01:49:42,868 --> 01:49:45,662
Expel me!

1862
01:49:45,662 --> 01:49:47,372
Everything that that boy
said is true.

1863
01:49:47,372 --> 01:49:49,874
Everything he said
about Bailey and me,

1864
01:49:49,875 --> 01:49:52,961
about the political corruption
in my state, it's true.

1865
01:49:52,961 --> 01:49:56,089
Everything he said about most
of us in this chamber is true,

1866
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:57,382
and we know it!

1867
01:49:59,051 --> 01:50:01,470
I am not fit for any office.

1868
01:50:01,470 --> 01:50:05,970
I am not fit for any place
of honor or trust.

1869
01:50:06,642 --> 01:50:11,142
I demand that this senate
expel me.

1870
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:15,525
Expel me, not him.

1871
01:50:15,526 --> 01:50:17,486
Expel me.
