1
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,351
That shit!

2
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,437
- Hello!
- Hello!

3
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,354
- So, did you ask 'em?
- Yep. They said fine.

4
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,271
Oh, good!

5
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,277
Sure it's okay with your mom,
though, right?

6
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,436
Yeah, she doesn't care.
She's working.

7
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,357
Isn't she coming up this weekend?

8
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,596
I don'tknow.

9
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,478
So, ah, come on, how cute is he?
Spitit out.

10
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,790
- Oh, he's kind of gorgeous.
- Yeah?

11
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,078
He's sort of like a cousin, butnot
really. He wants to be a forestranger.

12
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,512
Oh, good! Well, then after dinner
we could set a fire in your room,
and he can come and rescue us.

13
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,200
You should've seen the look
on her face.

14
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,517
I never laughed so hard, I swear to God.
I just can'tbelieve you mightmiss it.

15
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,158
Oh.

16
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,356
Hi, Gulliver.
How you doin', boy?

17
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,310
Hey, Pilgrim.

18
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,634
Come here.

19
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,193
Hey, babe.
You're such a beautiful boy.

20
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,710
What are you thinkin', huh?
What are you thinkin', boy?

21
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,633
You wanna go for a ride?

22
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,159
Let's go for a ride.
Come on. Come on, boy. Come on.

23
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,877
- Hello?
- It's me.

24
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,872
- Hi.
- Hi.

25
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,278
- So what train are you taking?
- Um, I should be in by 2:00.

26
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,518
Okay.
You wantme to pick you up?

27
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,431
No, I can take a cab.
Grace go riding?

28
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,870
Mm-hmm. What do you want to do
about dinner?

29
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,992
- I hadn't thought.
- I can ask to try thatplace
Emily says...

30
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,430
- Oh, hang on.
- They're here, so...

31
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,157
l, I'll let you go. We'll figure it out
when you gethere, okay?

32
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,239
Yeah, okay. Okay. Bye.
Hello?

33
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,234
Please! Oh, God, please!

34
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,079
Oh, wait. Have you seen that
stupid cereal commercial? It's like...

35
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,636
-And where are the paintings? It's about
her work, and we can't even see it.
-But we're trying to...

36
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,194
We can change the colour of the deck,
and we can move it up so then
you can see the paintings...

37
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,073
We need to see the paintings.
She's an artist.

38
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,713
- Have you checked on her going rate?
- Gottschalk.

39
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,633
Yes. The legal department's
on thatrightnow.

40
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,751
- David!
- Did you speak to Felton?

41
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,030
Yes, we're suing.

42
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,391
Well, is that absolutely necessary?
lt'll justmake it a bigger story.

43
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,195
- Am I on the speaker?
- David, he signed an agreement
thathe wouldn't talk to the press...

44
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,153
and now he's libelled me
by saying I faked the figures.

45
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,869
- You're not going soft on me, are you?
- Well, nothing like a good public feud.

46
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,558
Exactly!

47
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,197
- You know thatkid Adam?
- Yeah.

48
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,869
- Mm-mmm, he's very cute!
- l, I think you'd make a good couple,
Grace.

49
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,558
- I don't think so.
- Oh, I do!

50
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,596
- You think he's cute?
- Eww! Are you serious?

51
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,632
- I think he's cute.
- Oh, I think he's lucky
thathe lives next door to you.

52
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,796
- I think, I think l...
- What do you think?

53
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,757
I think you have a crush on him.

54
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,357
All right, let's take a shortcut.
Let's take a shortcut.

55
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,948
- You know, we can't even read it.
- Friday is confirmed.
- Right, okay.

56
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,272
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We have to reshoot this.

57
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,436
- I said it
- I said that
- I said it

58
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,834
- It's "that." It's "that."
- I said it

59
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,430
- I swear to God, it's "that."
- lt, it, it, it!
- It's "that."

60
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,238
- All right, fine.
Let's start again. Ready?
- All right, fine, fine, fine.

61
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,676
All right.
I methim at a party

62
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,349
And he told me how to drive

63
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,313
He said he'd like to do itbackwards

64
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,317
I said it
It

65
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,635
- Come on.
- Judith.

66
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,393
I said it
lt!

67
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,516
Come on!

68
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,479
Gulliver. Gulliver, up!
Up, Gulliver! Whoa!

69
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,795
- Judith!
- Hey! No! No, no, no!

70
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,115
Grace, look out!

71
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,119
- Pilgrim! Judith, Judith!
- Grace!

72
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,432
Hello!

73
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,836
No!

74
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,196
Gulliver!

75
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,313
Gulliver, stop!
Hold it, Gulliver!

76
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,596
Gulliver! Come on!

77
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,557
Robert.

78
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,197
Judith's dead.

79
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,630
And what about Grace?

80
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,598
- She's in pretty bad shape.
- It's a multiple trauma.

81
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,553
- Where is she?
- She's still in the O.R.

82
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,315
- O.R.? What for?
- l-lt's just... It's...

83
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,752
It's a mid-shaft, tib-fib fracture
with a vascular compromise, meaning
the blood supply to the lower leg...

84
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,832
They think they have to take part
of the leg off.

85
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,032
Which leg?

86
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,275
T-The rightleg.

87
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,797
Oh, Jesus.

88
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,393
Okay.

89
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,311
Just take it easy.

90
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,069
This is gonna be tough on both of us.

91
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,754
So let's notmake it any harder
than ithas to be.

92
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,711
Judith.

93
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,679
- Thatbag's almost empty.
- Oh, they'll be in to change it.

94
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,509
If you leave it up to these people...
Excuse me.

95
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,359
- My daughter needs a new I.V.
- Yes, I know. We have her down.

96
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,994
Well, I'd like it
taken care of now, please.

97
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,310
You have to stay on top
of these people constantly.

98
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,317
I'm sorry.

99
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,671
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

100
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,357
We really should lether get some rest,
and I do have to change the bandage.

101
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,439
You can come back in a couple of hours
and see how she's doing.

102
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,314
Mrs MacLean? Mrs MacLean,
you have a call on line two.
You can take itright there.

103
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,993
- Hello?
- Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?

104
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,428
Her leg was very damaged,
and they had to remove it.

105
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,438
Oh, God. Annie, I'm so sorry.

106
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,080
Listen, l, I know
that you're being hit with a lotnow...

107
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,955
and it's hard to think
about anything else,
butl have to talk to you aboutPilgrim.

108
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,231
Hello?

109
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,117
Yeah, I'm here.

110
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,312
I've never seen an animal
with these injuries still breathing.

111
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,908
I'd like your permission
to puthim down.

112
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,160
- It's, it's really the best thing...
- Uh, l... Y... Uh...

113
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,795

114
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,548
Um, look, Liz.
The doctor's here rightnow...

115
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,035
and l, I can'tmake this decision
on my own.

116
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,759
- Annie, I understand that,
butl have to know...
- Uh, just do what you can.

117
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,440
- Okay?
- Annie, no matter whatl do,
this horse will never be the same.

118
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,592
Well, look, l, l, l, I just don'tknow.
It's Grace's horse, so when she...

119
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,077
- It's notright to make it suffer.
- I cannot deal with this now, Liz.

120
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,272
l-lf you need a yes or a no,
then don't do it.

121
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,474
Okay? Just, just, just, j-just do
what you can for him, okay?

122
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,158
Right.

123
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,710
Animal should be put down.
Anybody can see that.

124
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,919
What did he say?

125
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,468
Nothing.
He's just going off duty.

126
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,478
Well! That's importantinformation, huh?

127
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,318
Christ.

128
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,510
Doctors, huh?

129
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,032
I'm gonna get to know all
the nurses' names.

130
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,670
It's, it's good to know their names.

131
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,031
- I'll go get some of her things.
- I'll go.

132
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,035
No! I'll go.
You stay, in case she wakes up.

133
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,952
You guys go on ahead.
I'll be up by Christmas.

134
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,996
Oh, I meant to tell you. I got
those tickets for the Knicks game.

135
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,513
Good.

136
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,712
- Wanna come, Annie?
- No. Why don't you go with a friend,
Grace?

137
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,637
Yeah.

138
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,393
Wanna eat something else, honey?
We can order out something else.

139
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,239
No, I'm justnot thathungry.
That's all.

140
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,231
Well, you should try to eat anyway.
It's the only way you're gonna...

141
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,999
I said I wasn'thungry.

142
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,675
- Wanna watch some television?
- I think she should finish first.
- Maybe.

143
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,709
I just... l... I can't.

144
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,877

145
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,758
No, Dad! I gotit. Gotit.

146
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,035
Sorry.

147
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,875
- You've got to stop doing that.
- What?

148
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,478
Helping her all the time.

149
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,434
Running to her every time she trips,
anticipating her.

150
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,473
You know, Annie,
this didn't justhappen to you.

151
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,439
Hi, Grace.

152
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,153
I don't care whathe told you.
The man's a liar.

153
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,396
He's a actor, for God's sake.

154
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,590
He'd do anything to get a cover.

155
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,109
Gracie, whathappened?

156
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,558
It doesn'tmatter.
I just...

157
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,274
I don't wanna come back.
That's all.

158
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,588
Well, what are you gonna do? I mean,
you have to go to school, sweetheart.

159
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,711
I said no!

160
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,469
I don't want to come back.
That's it. I wanna go home.

161
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,670
Grace, listen to me. Hmm?

162
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,031
Your leg is justhealing, and you have
to give the rest of you time as well.

163
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,990
Is that your version of a pep talk?

164
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,113
Well, you're not staying home all day,
feeling sorry for yourself.

165
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,629
You're gonna get up,
and you're gonna figure this out.

166
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,557
Fine.

167
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,031
It's still early.
What's your next class?

168
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,836
Gym.

169
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,755
Appears to be an excellent jump.
Head and hands, eyes, perfect.

170
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,719
Pilgrim moves with absolute confidence
at the command of Miss MacLean.

171
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,750
- Whatis it, sweetheart?
- I wanna see Pilgrim.

172
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,034
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi.

173
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,712
It's so good to see you.
How are you doing?

174
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,870
- She's doing just great.
Aren't you, kiddo?
- I'm fine.

175
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,037
Watch your step.

176
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,118
Mind how you go.
It's muddy back there.

177
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,912
Back there?

178
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,511
W-Well, what do you, what do you mean?
Why isn'the in the barn
with the other horses?

179
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,710
Well, Grace, you see...

180
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,038
Pilgrim justisn't the same horse
thathe used to be.

181
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,152
As a matter of fact, maybe now's
not the best time for you to see him.

182
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,994
I really wanna see him.

183
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,318
Can you open it, please?

184
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,959
Hey!

185
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,191
Hello, beautiful boy.

186
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,594
- No! No!
- Grace.
- Oh, God, no, no, please.

187
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,395
- No, Grace.
- No, no, no, no. Leave me alone!

188
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,189
Here. Grace. Grace!

189
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,471
Mr MacLean, I'm so sorry.

190
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,554
- Dad, why didn't you tell me?
- I'm so sorry.

191
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:51,079
You should've told her, Annie.
This animal is beyond help.

192
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,918
Annie, can I have your permission now
to puthim down?

193
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,953
No.

194
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,310
And getme every publication on riding,
racing, breeding.

195
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,273
Everything.
Medical publications as well.

196
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,994
Veterinarian journals. And tell them
it's me, and I wantitnow.

197
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,516
- Hold on, hold on. Gottschalk.
- I'll call him back.

198
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,716
- He says he's on his way
to the airport, he really needs...
- Lucy, I'll call him back.

199
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,234
I'll call him back.
Just getme whatl want.

200
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,396
"A million years before man...

201
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,193
"they grazed the vast
and empty plains...

202
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,117
"living by voices
only they could hear.

203
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,637
"They first came to know man
as the hunted knows the hunter...

204
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,712
"for long before he used horses
for his labours...

205
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,349
"he killed them for meat.

206
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,038
"The alliance with man
would forever be fragile...

207
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,277
"for the fear he'd struck
into their hearts...

208
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,630
"was too deep to be dislodged.

209
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,795
"Since thatNeolithic moment...

210
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,390
"when a horse was firsthaltered...

211
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,035
"there were those among men
who understood this.

212
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,030
"They could see

213
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,469
"and soothe the wounds

"The secrets uttered softly
into troubled ears.

215
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,271
These men were known
as the Whisperers."

216
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,070
It's perfectly shot,
perfectly cropped...

217
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,310
perfectly laid out,
and I am so bloody bored.

218
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,516
Start again.

219
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,269
Thank you.
Would you excuse me for a moment?

220
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,197
Yes.

221
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,071
- Hello?
- Yeah, this is Tom Booker.
I got a message you called.

222
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,159
Oh, hello, Mr Booker.
It's Annie MacLean from Cover.

223
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,157
You know, the magazine.

224
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,311
Um, well, thank you
for returning my call.

225
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,908
- Is there something
I can do for you, ma'am?
- Yes, yes.

226
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,794
I read this article about what you do
for people with horse problems.

227
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,151
Well, truth is, I help horses
with people problems.

228
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,191
Well, whichever way
you want to putit.

229
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,791
Uh, this article said that you were,
you were a, a horse whisperer.

230
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,351
Oh, they said that, huh?
A whisperer. Hmm.

231
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,313
And I was hoping that you'd come
to New York...

232
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,153
and take a look atmy daughter's horse
and possibly do some...

233
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,835
Ma'am, I'm sorry, butl'm,
I'm afraid you've misunderstood
whatever itis you read.

234
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,480
Because that's not exactly whatl do.
I mostly conduct clinics, you see, and...

235
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,194
Well, could you come to New York
just for the day?

236
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,117
- It's only a few hours by plane.
- And I'm not doin' them now.

237
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,038
I'm on my way to Montana where I have
a ranch to take care of.

238
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,913
Well, I'd pay your fare, of course.
Uh, first class.

239
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,713
Ma'am, first class to Montana
is a waste of good money.

240
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,191
Well, if you could just give me a time
when you'd be available.

241
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,431
Say, am l, am I being too polite here
when I say "no" in Nevada?

242
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,232
Does thatmean "yes" where you are?

243
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,920
Look, I'm really sorry for your
situation, but there's nothing I can do.

244
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,191
You just called the wrong person is all.
I'm sure there's some fine horse doctors
back east.

245
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,117
No, butl don't want a horse doctor.

246
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,198
- I want, I want you.
- So l, I hope everything goes okay
with you and your horse.

247
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,794
- Well, but you see, it's notmy horse.
- So, so, goodbye now.

248
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,875
Grace?

249
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,991
Grace, it's Mom.

250
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,634
Grace?

251
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,750
Grace?

252
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,549
Are you all right?

253
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,030
- I've decided aboutPilgrim.
- Oh.

254
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,037
I think we should puthim down.

255
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,319
It's not fair to lethim suffer.

256
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,915
- Well, I think that's a very...
- Maybe they should putme down, too.

257
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,598
- What?
- I'm notmuch use anymore.

258
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,476
You're getting a fax.

259
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,068
- You're up late.
- Is it?

260
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,758
- How was the dinner?
- Is Grace asleep?

261
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,677
- Yeah, I think so.
- Nothing we haven'theard before.

262
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,633
Justlouder this time. That's all.

263
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,789
- So why'd you go?
- Well, one of us had to.

264
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,309
They're still our friends, Annie.

265
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,272
Listen, I had a thought.
What do you think
we go someplace warm, the three of us?

266
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,552
Bermuda or the Bahamas or...
What?

267
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,716
Mmm, nothing.

268
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,876
No, I just don'tknow if Bermuda
would be such a good idea.

269
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,516
- Grace would have to wear
summer dresses or shorts.
- Oh, yeah, of course, of course.

270
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,635
Whatis it?

271
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,399
I want to take Pilgrim out to see this
horse guy. Drive him out to Montana.

272
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,390
- No, I'm serious.
- Now, wait a minute.

273
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,598
- I thought you said you didn'tlike
the way he sounded on the phone.
- Well, I didn't.

274
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,638
- I want to take Grace with me.
- You're kidding!

275
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,836
Liz'll find me a trailer.
We can stay atmotels along the way.

276
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,990
- What, you made arrangements already?
- No, I just checked out a few things.
You know.

277
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,999
- Wait a minute. Drive a crazed horse
all the way to Montana with...
- Oh, he's not crazed, Robert.

278
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,395
- Don't exaggerate.
- No, I can't justpack up and leave.

279
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,159
- Well, I'm not asking you to.
I'll do it.
- By yourself? How?

280
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,078
- You can't take care of Pilgrim.
- He'll be sedated.

281
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,230
- I do know a thing or two abouthorses.
- What about the magazine?

282
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,430
I'm in charge.
I can oversee things from Montana.

283
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,351
- I can take my fax, my computer.
- Oh, you're in charge.

284
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,749
Well, what about Grace? The doctor says
she needs stability and security.

285
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,189
Well, I can't say he's being
all that effective with her.

286
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,313
- Are you a psychiatrist?
He says it takes time.
- Well, I don't care whathe says!

287
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,556
I cannot sithere and pretend
everything's gonna be all right.

288
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,591
- I am notpretending. I am trusting.
- We have to do something, Robert.

289
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,958
- Other people know more
about this than we do.
- We are losing... We are losing her!

290
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,749
I don't care what the doctors say.
They don'tknow her.

291
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,879
I don't care
if this doesn't sound rational.
Nobody is suggesting anything better!

292
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,268
l, I can't explain it, Robert.
I justhave this feeling.

293
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,675
I justknow it's the right thing.

294
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,551
Why, Annie?

295
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,194
I justknow it.

296
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,555
Does this, uh, cowboy vet
know that you're coming?

297
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,558
Yeah.

298
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,031
Whatif Grace doesn't wanna go?

299
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,076
She will if you think she should.

300
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,394
- And you think it's best
if I don't come.
- No, that's not whatl said.

301
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,511
Daddy?

302
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,914
I don't wanna go.

303
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,675
Straightback. Come on.
A little closer. A little more.

304
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,273
Watch it. Getbehind him.

305
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,990
Hold it! Getback! Hold it.

306
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,917
- Watch it!
- There he goes, Eddie!

307
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,555
- Why don't you getinside and...
- Lady, we're doing the best we can!

308
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:29,237
- It's the only way to load
this kind of horse.
- Keep trying.

309
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,557
- Maybe we should give him
another sedative.
- We did.

310
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,278
Get the gate! Get the gate!

311
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,119
Let's get out of here!
Hold that door!

312
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,914
You got a gun, justin case?

313
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,831
Of course not.

314
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,911
That's probably best.

315
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,271
You may want to shoot yourself
halfway to Ohio.

316
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,992
Grace, are you hungry?
Do you want to stop for lunch?

317
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,111
I don't care.

318
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,989
I want to find a place before
it gets dark. What do you think?

319
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,959
- Grace?
- Doesn'tmatter.

320
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,871
Okay, Lucy, look.
This is whatl'll do.

321
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,468
I'll get to the nextmotel,
see if they have a fax and then...

322
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,991
Oh, wait, hang on. Uh...
I gotta go, okay? Later.

323
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,191
Grace, do you want
to put your music on up here?

324
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,230
Grace.

325
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,272
Do you want to put your music on
up here?

326
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,478
And when you purchase
your Eureka World Deluxe Vac...

327
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,309
Here the agricultural markets
and farm news headlines continue to...

328
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,237
Insecticide for small grains.

329
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,316
Important to always read
and follow label instructions...

330
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,750
This here man was rejuvenated
in the grace of the Lord.

331
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,717
He was washed.

332
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,794
Mmm, Grace, look at this.

333
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,559
Do you wanna see that?

334
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,672
- I don't care.
- "I don't care."

335
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:34,280
Oh, it'll be fun. You haven't seen
any of the sights yet. It's history.

336
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,994
When I was 13, I used to love
doing things like this.

337
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,918
Oh, you were never 13, Mom.

338
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,751
Oh.

339
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,911
Greatidea, Mom. Now what?

340
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,118
- How long is this gonna go on?
- What?

341
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,354
You know whatl mean.

342
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,154
Do you want us to go back home?
Is that what you want?

343
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,840
What are you asking me for?
You didn't ask me if I wanted to come
in the firstplace.

344
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,757
Now I get to decide? Sorry.

345
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,676
Do you know who I'm doing this for?
I'm doing this for you.

346
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,548
Bullshit! It's all about you, about
you deciding, about you being right!

347
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,636
-lt's like we work for you or somethin'!
-I don'tbelieve this!

348
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,228
- How come Daddy didn't come, huh?
- What do you mean?

349
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,954
You know everything.
You figure it out.

350
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,595
- Your father had to work.
- Yeah, right!

351
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,871
- Would you please stop acting like
you know what you're talking about?
- You are amazing, you know?

352
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,793
I mean, you actlike I don't even live
in thathouse anymore.

353
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,519
What, you think
I don'tknow what's going on?
You think I'm still five years old!

354
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,830
- When you actlike this, you are.

355
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,235

359
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,270
- You okay, ma'am?
- Yeah, I'm, I'm fine.

360
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,794
That young lady's gettin'
a little worried.

361
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,876
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

362
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,515
- Good night, ma'am.
- Good night.

363
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,231
You buckled up?

364
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,600
- Are you cold?
- A little.

365
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,596
You may have seen
the Kennel Club champion being rewarded
with a box of chocolates the other day.

366
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,517
Veterinarians and humane...

367
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,394
Butl can't get you out of my mind
Everybody...

368
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,311
Winter weather got you down?

369
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,313
Wilson Travel is offering charter
packages to sunny Orlando, Florida.

370
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,868
Well, looks like lots of precipitation,
as we mentioned, overnight.

371
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,952
GreatFalls, an inch and a half.
Plus, itlooks like
about another half an inch.

372
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,113
He had an epiphany. Paul had
been transformed by the grace of God...

373
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,475
so he was a new creation in Christ.

374
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,118
Is there a man who is completely...

375
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,119
Hop on down to the Northern Plains
John Deere. We'll be glad to see you.

376
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,354
Gee, this place looks like fun.

377
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,554
- Don't they believe in signs
around here?
- What would they say?

378
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,633
- "Ten miles to Big Rock,
twenty miles to Bigger Rock"?
- No.

379
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,354
- Great trip, Mom.
I'm having so much fun.
- I think I should turn here.

380
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,514
Oh, yeah, those rocks over there,
much more interesting.

381
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,432
Can we take a look atBronty's foal
when we're done here, Dad?

382
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,351
Sure, as long as she don'tmind.

383
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,790
There's this kid at school says
we should have imprint-trained him.

384
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,071
Says if you do it soon as they're born,
makes 'em real easy to handle later on.

385
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,116
That's what some folks say.

386
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,510
There's this thing on the TV
about a guy who does it with geese.

387
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,070
He has this aeroplane,
and these baby geese all grow up
thinking it's their mom.

388
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,159
And he flies it, and they just follow.
You hear about that, Uncle T?

389
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,196
Yeah. Heard aboutit.

390
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,788
Well, what do you think
about all that stuff?

391
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,589
Well, I'll tell ya, Joey,
itmightbe all right for geese to
grow up thinkin' they're aeroplanes...

392
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,154
buthorses, as far as I can tell,
can't fly.

393
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,391
We expecting company?

394
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,714

Annie MacLean from New York.
We talked on the phone.

398
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,312
I had a little bit of a hard time
finding the place. There are no signs.

399
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,637
Oh, there are plenty of signs,
justnotmany of them printed.

400
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,832
Why do I get the impression
that you're justnot driving through?

401
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,078
I want you to take a look atmy horse.
Now, it won't take long.

402
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,469
And if you still feel the same way,
then I'm sure I can find...

403
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,477
You thinkin' aboutpersonally
driving me back east?

404
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,388
Oh, no, no, no. No, I broughthim along,
and my daughter, too.

405

406
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,239
- You hauled him all the way outhere?
- Well, yeah.

407
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,232
I had a trailer. It's notlike
I made him run alongside the car.

408
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,033
- By yourself?
- Mm-hmm.

409
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,995
Well, ma'am, I appreciate the pains
that you've obviously gone through...

410
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,072
Look, please don't do
the "Shucks, ma'am" thing again.

411
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,829
I have just driven a few thousand miles
for a few minutes of your time.

412
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,030
I have broughthim
all the way outhere.

413
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,674
Just take a look athim.
If you still feel the same way...

414
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,797
I will be on the road by morning, and
you'll never hear from me again, okay?

415
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,558
Deal?

416
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,994
We're at the Lazy J Motel.
Whenever you're free.

417
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,319
You don'thave to call.

418
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,951
Jesus!

419
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,473
- No, this is what you call the boonies.

421
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,230
No services,
and there's one doctor in town.

422
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,715
Butl managed to find a therapist
for Grace.

423
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,876
I had to drive, like, two hours.

424
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,033
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

425
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,592
- Yeah?
- Uh, I'm Tom Booker.

She's on the phone.

427
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:50,069
- Could l...
- Mom, there's a cowboy here.

428
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,870
This is not Gottschalk's business.
Why is he interfering with this?

429
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,871
I told him I'd take care of it.

430
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,549
No. I told him I'd take care of it,
and I will take care of it.

431
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,194

434
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,475
Uh, it's completely ridiculous.
It's completely ridiculous.

435
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,353

439
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,069
No, really?
I can'tbelieve that.

440
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,716
- Is she gonna be long?
- Probably. She's on the phone
23 hours a day.

441
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,752
- What does she do?
- She's an editor.

442
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,155
An editor? Ah, ah, yeah.

443
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,478
Justin case she hasn't told you,
which she probably hasn't...

444
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,556
I don't wanna be a part of this,
okay?

445
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,399
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

446
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,916
Hi. Sorry about that.

447
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,715
Grace, this is Mr Booker.
Did you look atPilgrim yet?

448
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,751
I was gonna take thatlook now.

449
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,798
Would you like me to come with you?
I have to run over to the office
and give Mr Peterson a cheque.

450
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,472
- Doesn'tmatter.
- Grace?

451
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,593
Do you wanna come with us,
take a look atPilgrim?

452
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,029
- Probably best she stay behind anyway.
- Okay.

453
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,430
- Howdy, Lester.
- Howdy.

454
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,034
- Goin' to see thathorse?
- Yeah, I thoughtl might.

455
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,517
Well, I hope you gotinsurance.
That dirty son of a bitch.

456
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,795
Well, you're the closest
anyone's ever gotten.

457
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,357
I have to be honest with you.

458
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,153
I still feel you've made
a long trip for nothin'.

459
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,560
Butbefore I even think aboutit...

460
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,593
I need to know somethin' rightnow.

461
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,870
And it's a question for Grace.

462
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,276
You see, when I work with a horse,
it's no good justme doin' it.

463
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,430
- The owner's gotta be involved, too.
- Well, that'll be a little complicated.

464
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,870
You can make it as complicated
or as easy as you like.

465
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,554
But she's the one that's gonna
be ridin' him. Am I right?

466
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,558
Hey? Right?

467
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,709
Now, here's the deal.

468
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,274
I don'tknow thatl can do anything.

469
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,630
Butl'm prepared to give it a go,
if you'll help.

470
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,717
- Oh, you have a problem with that?
- Isn'tit, like, obvious?

471
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,554
Not to me.
Either you want to or you don't.

472
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,037
- Look, I'll talk to...
- Excuse me. With all due respect,
this is her decision, not yours.

473
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,277
Now, I don't wanna waste
anybody's time here, mostly mine.

474
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,238
Well, nothin' else to do around here.

475
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:25,189
That's not good enough.
I can'thelp you.

476
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,112
What do I have to do?

477
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,471
I said, what do I have to do?

478
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,318
Well, what does she want?

479
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,796
- Does she want you to take care
of her horse?
- Somethin' like that.

480
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,838
- And they're stayin' in a motel?
- The Lazy J.
Can I have some butter please?

481
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:50,193
- Not exactly a tourist stop.
- Well, well, what about the girl?
Doesn't she go to school?

482
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,438
- I don'tknow.
- You know, I just think she's got
a lot of nerve showin' up here.

483
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,273
Draggin' that, you know, poor animal
and that child all the way...

484
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,797
Honey, don't eat with your fingers.
Frank, don't you think
she's got a lot of nerve?

485
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,316
Well, hell, I don'tknow. According
to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman.

486
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,356
She must've thoughtit was worth it.

487
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,752
Yeah. Well, I guess they'll want
feedin', bein' outhere all day long.

488
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,793
- I don't think they'll expect that.
- What, they gonna drive 40 miles into
town every time they want a hamburger?

489
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,912
- Mixed salad.
- What?

490
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,873
Well, I believe women from New York
eatmixed salads.

491
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,956
- Ain't thatright, Tom?
- I believe so.

492
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:28,358
Well, that's just what we need!
A vegetarian from New York
on our cattle ranch.

493
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,592
A Great Traveller, interested,
notmerely a good one...

494
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,716
is a kind of introspective.

495
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,631
As she covers the ground outwardly...

496
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:41,633
so she advances towards fresh
interpretations of herself, inwardly.

497
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,149
And this is the quality
which lends Frea Starks' books...

498
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,074
the memorable poetic density
which is their special cachet.

499
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,237
Moreover, itis this quality
which makes them as fresh and strike...

500
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,069
You're at a good place to quit.

501
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,589
Oh, I gothim movin' out a bit.
That's aboutit.

502
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,399
It's still a long ways away
from gettin' a leg over him.

503
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,513
Well, we're movin' along.

504
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,070
What's he doing?

505
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,398
Is this some kind
of physical therapy?

506
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,190
Hello? Hello?

507
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,629
What? No, you're breaking up.

508
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,195
Hold on. Hold on.

509
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,556
Don't start a fight with him.
Joey, give me your rope.

510
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:38,036
Just to pull him back.
We'll never gethim outta there.
Letme go in after him.

511
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,475
Mr Booker, I'm really not comfortable
with you taking these kind of risks.

512
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,234
- Oh, God!
- Hey, hey! Pilgrim!

513
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,351
Lethim go!

514
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,391
Lethim go.

515
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,670
Does thathurt you?

516
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,071
Only when I kick somebody.

517
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,957
Don't you go to school?

518
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,389
Taking a break.

519
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,993
Don't you?

520
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,755
School term's out early for us
so we can work the ranch.

521
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,315
Look athim outin the pasture.

522
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,915
He must've been a big,
beautiful-lookin' horse.

523
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,474
How was he to ride?

524
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,518
Excuse me.
I've got chores to look after.

525
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,231
Are we in the way?

526
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,836
Should we leave?

527
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,076
I guess we'll go then.

528
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,469
From now on,
leave your phone somewhere else.

529
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,588
Miss MacLean, would you and
your daughter like to stay for dinner?

530
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,789
Joe, take off your hat at the table.
I don't want to say it again.

531
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,396
Uh, dear Lord...

532
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,119
we are humbly thankful
for these gifts...

533
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:44,159
for the blessings on our home,
our family and our guests.

534
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,198
And bless those that aren't
as fortunate.

535
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,874
Bless all God's creatures. Amen.

536
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,434
- Amen.
- Amen.

537
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,393
- Like some roastbeef?
- Looks great. Thanks.

538
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,477
Thank you.

539
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,311
- Want some milk?
- Yeah. Thanks.

540
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:23,237
OI' Hank got us
a couple more men...

541
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,515
to move the cattle.

542
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,552
And whatkind of cattle
do you raise, Mr Booker?

543
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,513
Well, we run a mixed herd,
butmostly Black Baldies.

544
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,158
And, uh, what're, what're those?

545
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:36,755
- Black Angus Herefords
instead of straightHerefords.
- Oh, Black Angus.

546
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,359
- There you go.
- Of course.

547
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,914
And, uh, what's,
what's the difference?

548
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,510
- Well, they suit the weather better.
- And their utters are black
instead of pink.

549
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,029
They don't getburnt
with the sun bouncin' off the snow.

550
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,590
- They make good mothers.
- Our daddy raised straightHerefords.

551
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,558
You know, that's interesting. Um...

552
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,433
I've always wondered every time l,
you know, when I go into a restaurant...

553
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,950
what's the difference between a regular
steak and a Black Angus steak?

554
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:03,356
I can never taste the difference,
butl could swear that one
was more tender than the other.

555
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,395
I didn'tknow there was
thatmuch difference between the cows.

556
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,875
Of course, I've never been on
a cow farm before.

557
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,235
Seems to me that the bulls
have the best of the time.

558
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:18,195
Justlaying around the fields,
waiting for somebody to come along
and ask them to do their work.

559
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,389
So on balance,
I reckon I'd choose being a cow.

560
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,075
Yeah.

561
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,317
- Hey, young man.
- You getback up to bed!

562
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,998
So how's the Lazy "J"
holding up for you?

563
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,395
Oh, it's fine.

564
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,034
I still can't get used to how dark
it gets around here, though.

565
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:55,199
Every time I leave the ranch,
I hold my breath
until I can see the motel.

566
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:58,357
Well, by golly,
that's a lot of drive time.

567
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:03,799
You know, Tom, while you're working
on thathorse of theirs...

568
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,111
Annie and Grace should move
into the old creek house.

569
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:18,552
Nobody's usin' it. It's silly for her
to be driving back and forth...

570
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:20,955
when she, she don'tknow her way around
that well.

571
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,435
Well, that's very kind of you,
butreally we're fine where we are.

572
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,869
Oh, hell, look,
I know the Lazy "J."

573
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,956
Whole place is as good
as falling down around your ears.

574
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:31,112
Frank, they're already
all settled in.

575
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,549
And anyway, I'm sure
they want their privacy.

576
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,878
Well, it's got doors, Diane,
and private as can be.

577
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,589
Tom?

578
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,989
I don'thave a problem with it.
I think it's up to Annie.

579
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,033
Well, it'd be great for when my dad
comes to visit.

580
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,628
Where is your dad, honey?

581
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,433
He's athome, working.

582
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,351
You know, um... I don'tknow, um...

583
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,878
Is it worth it, really? I mean,
how long do you think you'll carry on
working with Pilgrim?

584
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,190
That depends on Pilgrim.

585
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:11,190
I know. Me, too.
When are you comin' to visit?

586
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:17,588
Yeah, well, there'll be plenty of room
'cause we're moving down to the ranch.

587
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,989
Yeah, yeah. They've got this really cute
little house down by the creek.

588
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,156
It's really pretty.

589
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:26,353
Okay. Okay.
I love you, too.

590
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,076
Ho-Hold on.

591
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,037
Dad wants to talk to you.

592
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,479
Hi.

593
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,160
- Well, she sounds like
she's doing all right. How is she?
- Yeah.

594
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:41,111
You know, I think she seems
to be getting more comfortable
on the ranch...

595
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:44,437
which is, which is the only reason
I said yes to this move.

596
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,193
Well, thatmakes sense.

597
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:51,154
So, how are you doing out there
in Marlboro country?

598
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:54,755
- Is the magazine complaining at all?
- Yeah, butnothing I can'thandle.

599
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,394
Lucy says she thinks Gottschalk's
plotting. But what else is new, hmm?

600
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,796
So when are you coming home?

601
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,196
You know, I asked him thatmyself
tonight, and he doesn'tknow.

602
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:07,790
Hmm. I miss you, Annie.

603
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,149
Yeah, I know.
We miss you, too.

604
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,678
- Good night.
- 'Night.

605
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,508
Did you ask him to come visit?

606
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,556
You already did.
Do you wantme to help you pack?

607
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:46,279
- Hi.
- Howdy.

608
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,275
What's he doing?

609
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,437
He's tryin' go gethim
to hook on.

610
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,757
How's it going?

611
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,356
Get over there!

612
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,550
Ha! Come on!

613
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:33,115
Hey, you over there!

614
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,595
Wanna make yourself useful?

615
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,110
- Hey, Hank.
- Yeah?

616
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,151
I think you got a volunteer here.
You wanna take care of her?

617
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:56,112
Where's Grace? Grace?

618
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,077
- You okay?
- Yeah.

619
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,991
- Cocktail hour yet?
- What?

620
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:47,389
I said, is it cocktail hour yet?

621
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,437
Come here a second.

622
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:01,198
You handled thatpretty well.
I think it's time you started earning
your keep around here.

623
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:03,356
So when we're not working,
you're not doing your therapy...

624
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,637
I'd like you to help out
with the horses, you know,
rubbin' them, cleanin' the stalls.

625
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,637
Think you can handle that?

626
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:11,792
- That's not a question, is it?
- Nope.

627
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,751
Okay.

628
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,799
Hey, cowboy.

629
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:26,708
When I was out walkin'
one morning for pleasure

630
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,270
Spied a cowpuncher
come a-lopin' along

631
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:34,273
His hat was throwed back
and his spurs was a-jinglin'

632
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:38,319
And as he approached
he was singin' this song

633
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:44,674
Hey, you little ones.
How are you?

634
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:47,797
He was only 18, he had a flat
on his little pickup, and...

635
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,876
You know you're not allowed
to go swimming in the river.

636
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,514
And Marie here made the bestpie.
Cherry pie. Go get some.

637
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:56,275
As luck would have it, he didn'thave
all the lug nuts off...

638
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,756
but the jack slipped and fell
right on thatrock he calls a head.

639
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,473
Is he okay?

640
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,194
Well, itrearranged his scalp
about 12 inches...

641
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:09,517
Buthe always dreamed of having a place
where he could raise horses...

642
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:11,870
and have a whole separate life.

643
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:14,520
My grandson Joe is named for him.

644
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,393
And somebody told him
about a place called Stockett.

645
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,317
He got on his horse
and he rode over there...

646
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,954
and he got off, and he walked
as far as he could one way.

647
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:25,072
And then he turned around, and he walked
as far as he could to the other.

648
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:29,557
And then he decided that
that's where he was going to settle.

649
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:32,911
And that's where we raised
Frank and Tommy.

650
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,714
- Where do you call home?
- She's from New York, Mom.

651
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:42,399
Um...

652
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:45,995
Well, I was born in London,
butl'm from all over really.

653
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:49,112
My father was a diplomat,
and so we moved constantly.

654
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,430
Oh, my.
That sounds very important.

655
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,437
No.

656
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,875
No, he was, he was a wonderful man.

657
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,037
He died when I was 12, but we,
we lived all over the world.

658
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:03,159
We... It's, it's not the same as,
as knowing a place like this.

659
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:08,354
Well, sometimes people carry it
more on the inside...

660
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,396
than the outside.

661
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:17,075
If ithadn'thave been
for them troublesome doggies...

662
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:20,795
I suppose I could gather up
some of these cups and plates.

663
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,711
- You guys done with these?
- Yeah?

664
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,631
You better give me thatrecipe.
It was really...

665
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:27,359
I know, I know.
Be glad to tell her anything.

666
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,317
This family has quite a history.

667
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,834
Yeah, it's a story, all right.

668
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:38,030
- I love how she calls him Tommy.
- Yeah, always did.

669
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,674
I think she always favoured him.

670
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,597
She loves tellin' this story about...

671
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:46,871
when he was two years old,
he ran off...

672
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,918
and they found him sleepin'
in the barn...

673
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,278
between two gianthooves
of a Percheron stallion.

674
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:58,029
He said thathorse was protectin' him,
and nobody could convince him otherwise.

675
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,635
Why do you always wear thathat?

676
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,676
'Cause it fits my head.

677
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,191
- Wanna try it on?
- Come on!

678
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,670
What do you wantme to do?
What do you wantme to do?

679
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,916
Huh? What?
What do you call that?

680
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,671
Okay, one more time.

681
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,910
You gonna, you gonna sit on me? Here.

682
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,514
So you can watch this 'cause I don't
wanna do this too many times, okay?

683
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:54,955
Put your finger up. Okay?

684
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:04,356
Okay? Loop's knotted, right?

685
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:08,314
Looks like the only way to getit off
is to break the touch, right?

686
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,277
Now watch.
You watchin'?

687
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:13,352
Watch careful.

688
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,277
- Again! Again!
- Again! Again! One more time.

689
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,231
Oh, no, no. I don't fall
for that one twice.

690
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,715
Now, you guys get on in
before your mother calls you.

691
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,880
- Here.
- So...

692
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,797
Thank you.

693
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:47,675
- What?
- Do you ever sit still
for just a minute?

694
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,398
Well, you sit still too long
in New York and you getrenovated.

695
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,751
Why is it, Mr Booker,
that sometimes I get the feeling
that you're laughing atme?

696
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:02,075
I don'tknow. Why?

697
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:05,470
No. You're supposed to say
you're notlaughing atme.

698
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,309
Oh, I see. You take care of both sides
of the conversation, do you?

699
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,908
It's a man's world, Mr Booker.
Most women have to.

700
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,556
You can call me Tom.

701
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,510
Maybe I am laughin' a little bit.

702
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,558
I figure since you're here, itmight
be nice to relax into the place a bit.

703
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,277
Yeah.

704
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,039
Well, it's beautiful country.

705
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,116
And I could see having
some kind of a...

706
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,631
you know, vacation place, retreat.

707
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,354
Butl don'tknow how you do it
full-time.

708
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,755
Don't you miss
the rest of the world?

709
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,030
What's there to miss?

710
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,549
Well, if you've never lived
in a city with...

711
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:52,036
with museums and theatre and...

712
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,951
and restaurants and music...

713
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:57,032
uh, well, I can't explain.

714
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,549
Well, does Chicago count?

715
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,917
- You lived in Chicago?
- That's where I metmy wife.

716
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,877
You, you were, you were married
to a woman in Chicago?

717
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,271
Yeah, really. A woman.

718
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,914
No, I'm sorry. I didn't, I didn't...
No, I'm so...

719
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,991
I was studying engineering...

720
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,509
and she was studying music,
the cello.

721
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,277
And I once heard her play
a Dvorak concerto...

722
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:32,188
and I thoughtit was
the mostbeautiful piece of music
I'd ever heard in my life.

723
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:39,755
So, just who's laughin' at who here?

724
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,317
Jogger, huh?

725
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:42,318
I don't jog, Mr Booker. I run.

726
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:45,310
Well, that's lucky for you.

727
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,392
Grizzlies around here
mostly go for joggers.

728
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:51,512
You sleepin' okay in thathouse?

729
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,910
Well, I don't sleep well anywhere,
but the house is fine, yeah.

730
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:12,192
Oop. I have a way with animals.

731
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,117
That's all right.
He's just young.

732
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:16,276
Here, hold out your hand
just a little lower. That's it.

733
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,476
So he can get the smell of you.

734
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,391
He's beautiful.

735
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:28,234
- Now, how come you don'tride anymore?
- Hmm?

736
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,874
Grace told me you used to ride
when she was younger.

737
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,191
- She did?
- Yep.

738
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,031
