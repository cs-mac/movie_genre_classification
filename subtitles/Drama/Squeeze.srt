We concede. What the hell you doin'?

I'm playin' golf. What's it look like?

Hogwash. Get out of your head,

Temper's instant death in golf.

It's like boxin', right?

this ain't no U.S. Open,

better known as Screaming Jesus,

which for those who are unwashed
d and uninitiated,

641

that means that you can do

Did you see it?

00:31:42,517 --> 00:31:43,518
Oh, it's way down there.

660
00:31:43,618 --> 00:31:44,819
It's way down there.

We ain't gonna interfere with anybody.

677
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:15,116
Hit them. Hit them.

678
00:32:15,216 --> 00:32:16,918
Don't even worry about the fair way.

a man of action.

00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,583
Let's have a little action,
huh?

706
00:33:22,683 --> 00:33:24,852
Let's bet I can put this on the green...

709
00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:29,657
What part of that didn't you understand?

With your putter?

With my putter.

00:33:31,893 --> 00:33:35,763
I can tell you right now,
I'll take that bet.

How sure are we?

714
00:33:38,032 --> 00:33:39,701
Pretty damn sure.

...in the south end of an angry
bull headin' north...

I'll tell you what, Little John, calm down.

I'll let you buy this putt right
here for $1,000.

in the process?

Don't spend it all in one place, baby.

00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:15,056
I know. It's just it doesn't rhyme.

769
00:36:15,156 --> 00:36:17,125
That's why I always forget it.

770
00:36:17,225 --> 00:36:18,025
So where's your girlfriend?

771
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:19,961
She's missin' out on all the fun.

772
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:21,028
Oh, she, uh...

773
00:36:21,128 --> 00:36:22,563
...She's taking French classes.

774
00:36:22,663 --> 00:36:24,499
She really wants to go to Paris.

775
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,834
Something about a past life
attraction or something.

776
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,669
Too bad she's not a
little more obsessed...

777
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,659
...with makin' money in this life.

778
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:34,041
So, Riverboat, what got you caught up...

779
00:36:34,141 --> 00:36:35,276
... in all this racket anyway?

780
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:38,279
Well, now...

781
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:40,748
... Well, when I was a kid,

782
00:36:40,848 --> 00:36:42,917
I was pretty good at pitchin' horseshoes.

783
00:36:43,017 --> 00:36:45,253
One day after I got whipped pretty good...

784
00:36:45,353 --> 00:36:47,054
... for the few dollars I had.

785
00:36:47,154 --> 00:36:48,789
I discovered the son of a bitch...

786
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:53,376
...had moved the pitch back one
foot, 41 feet.

787
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,898
I tracked his sorry ass down...

788
00:36:56,998 --> 00:36:57,999
...and asked for my money back.

789
00:36:58,099 --> 00:36:59,967
You should have kicked his ass.

790
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:02,970
Yeah, well, I did get my money back.

791
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:05,039
And then he taught me some things...

792
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,009
...much more valuable than money.

793
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:09,443
What's that?

794
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:10,778
Well...

795
00:37:10,878 --> 00:37:15,216
...  Uh, see that watermelon over there?

796
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,417
AUGIE: Yeah.

797
00:37:16,517 --> 00:37:19,020
Now, what are the odds that you could...

798
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,123
... pitch one of these
cards across the room...

799
00:37:22,223 --> 00:37:24,892
...  and have it stick in that melon?

800
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,728
I would say the odds are pretty
good it can't be done.

801
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,973
Okay. Stick one of them $100 bills...

802
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:33,548
...you just won on that table.

803
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,036

00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,276

808
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:45,213
Ha.

809
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:46,247
Oh.

810
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,448
AUGIE: Wow.

811
00:37:47,548 --> 00:37:50,251
See, if you try to pitch it nor
mal like a baseball,

812
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,652
won't stick,

813
00:37:51,752 --> 00:37:54,088
but if you pull it back by your wrist...

814
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,157
...  and then fling it out backwards,

815
00:37:56,257 --> 00:37:57,892
it generates more velocity.

816
00:37:57,992 --> 00:38:01,511
Card flies sure and straight and...

for the right cause,

All right, you know what?

994
00:46:40,414 --> 00:46:43,884
I know I can't talk you out of this,

995
00:46:43,984 --> 00:46:48,489
so you go do whatever it is the
hell you gotta do.
