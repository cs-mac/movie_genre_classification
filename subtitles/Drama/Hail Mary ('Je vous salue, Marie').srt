00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,400
THE BOOK OF MARY

2
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,310
What do you think?

3
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,950
You'll escape routine if you're alone?

4
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,350
No, that's not it.

5
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,480
But I just can't stand this deal,

6
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,710
putting up with anything as
long as we stay together.

7
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,720
You always come back to that.

8
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,120
Admit it you are

9
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,280
so afraid of being abandoned,

10
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,640
you're fleeing into loneliness.

11
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,510
You should know by now.

12
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,720
Since you're here

13
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,030
for once

14
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,630
let's be serious.

15
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,720
Seeing you is hardly a blessing now.

16
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,690
Even for Mary.

17
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,630
It's no good.

18
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,280
And I’ve had it.

19
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,480
I can't work, I can't sleep.

20
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,800
I see, if we separate you'll sleep again?

21
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,520
You see how brutal you are?

22
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,260
You're brutal too, in your way.

23
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,450
You won't face up to things.

24
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,480
Listen Paul, you’ve cheated on
the contract from the start.

25
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,110
You can't brush that off.

26
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,040
I think it takes constant
inventiveness to succeed.

27
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,400
In your line of work,
you've lots of time for that.

28
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,910
It doesn't interest you, that's all.

29
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,990
So we play it safe and stay together.

30
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,790
What does that do for the child?

31
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,560
Loving's not investing.

32
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,350
You can save too,

33
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,600
not just give, or expect
everything from one person.

34
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,840
The way you've set things up,
you could talk that way.

35
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,950
You're never here.

36
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,000
I spent much more time at home.

37
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,560
I put a lot in and get little back.

38
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,970
We've been over this so often.

39
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,560
What other way is there?

40
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,890
Before, you didn't work,
you took care of Mary.

41
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,460
But now we're closer
to an even footing.

42
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,300
I don't agree.

43
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,180
I'm still here for serving,
caring for things.

44
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,430
That's a mother's job,
not a woman's.

45
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,580
I am tired.

46
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,190
Things have got to change for a while.

47
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,270
You're so impatient.

48
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,350
May be.

49
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,170
What I know now is...

50
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,320
that I don't need to be dominated
to feel understood.

51
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,150
I no longer need to lose.

52
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,040
I don't see where that gets you either.

53
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,390
I don't know.

54
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,910
I want to see clearly.

55
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,470
I wish you understood.

56
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,780
Understanding's scarce.

57
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,230
Truth is often deadly.
Your truths are fatal,

58
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,840
So don't complain afterwards.

59
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm not complaining,
just trying to see clearly.

60
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,160
Why is everyone so scared...

61
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,550
of clarity?

62
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,140
Your eyes hurt?

63
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,140
No, I'm alright.

64
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,950
I don't need your total sincerity.

65
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,470
It's comforting,
but not interesting.

66
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,960
Let's not start again.

67
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,980
No, let's not.

68
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,960
But try to understand sometimes.

69
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,740
For 10 years we've copied.

70
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,200
Now I want to invent.

71
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,610
No one's stopped you.

72
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,230
Anyway, women don't invent much.

73
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,750
Even the soul was invented by a man.

74
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,920
You're really encouraging.

75
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,270
You don't need encouragement now.

76
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,830
We can see how well you
do on your own.

77
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,500
Good morning! We continue
with our operation.

78
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,630
Now we cut the eye in half.

79
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,630
It's black, if you can see that.

80
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,520
I put this inside, it's the pupil.

81
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,840
The pupil, seen from outside,
magnified, of course,

82
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,040
is brown.

83
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,910
The eye is enormous,

84
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,010
but the pupil takes up a lot of space.

85
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,320
The rest is water.

86
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,920
Water, yes.

87
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,440
The pupil floats like a baby
in the belly of its mother.

88
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,160
When you look at things,
it's because of the pupil,

89
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,600
because it floats,

90
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,070
and when we move

91
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,430
as you see, it shifts.

92
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,160
Understand what I’m saying?

93
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,400
It's complicated, a bit technical.

94
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,550
Yes, it's mechanical and technical

95
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,820
and at the same time surgical.

96
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,200
You operate once for this illness.

97
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,530
If you do it twice, the patient dies.

98
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,580
In any case the eye withers.

99
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,080
It's a very serious operation.

100
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,560
Yes, I entirely agree there.

101
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,760
You undergo it after you've
almost been sick.

102
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,210
Because this gentleman,
you see his eye,

103
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,880
has been completely... shaken, see?

104
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,880
It's had a shock.

105
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,470
The eye's been completely terrorized,

106
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,750
so...

107
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,670
we can't do much for it.

108
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,270
Well, that's all for this program.

109
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,140
Good bye.

110
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,430
Spoken to Mary?

111
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,950
Not yet,

112
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,920
but I'll speak to her, of course.

113
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,080
And you'll have to tell her
what keeps you so far from her,

114
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,390
and from me.

115
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,800
You've thought of what
it'll mean to her,

116
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,720
shuttling between parents?

117
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,630
Stop talking as if it
was all my doing.

118
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,280
Silence, please.

119
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,230
My spirit with a heavy
fear forebodes

120
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,350
In black battalions,
stray ghosts ride

121
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,500
Driving me on to moving roads

122
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,540
closed in by bloodied
skies on every side.

123
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,420
How strange and wicked was our act?

124
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,270
Can you explain my trouble
and my fright?

125
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,640
Silence!

126
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,950
I said, silence!

127
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,920
Who can tell me...

128
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,430
what Baudelaire meant
to express in this poem?

129
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,110
If you weren't asleep, that is.

130
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,080
Get out your notebooks,
I'll give you some dictation.

131
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,280
Hurry! We have other things to do.

132
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,150
My spirit with a heavy fear forebodes...

133
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,090
Heavy fear,

134
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,980
black battalions,

135
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,650
with two "t's",

136
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,540
and stray ghosts...

137
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,950
Silence!

138
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,950
Yes?

139
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,110
Mary, I have something to tell you.

140
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,670
All right.

141
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,120
Go on. And make sure you've
made no spelling errors.

142
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,480
I have to talk to the principal.

143
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,990
I'm sure you know what it is.

144
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,320
Dad's going to live elsewhere.
Not for a long time.

145
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,080
Until winter, for example.

146
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,550
Right. To continue:

147
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,170
that seek to lead me
on shifting ways...

148
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,270
Mary!

149
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,160
You'll see dad on weekends and holidays.

150
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,360
Anyway, it's not for long.

151
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,540
Have we committed a strange act?
Explain if...

152
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,470
It's not that we don't love
each other anymore.

153
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,420
On the contrary.

154
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,410
But if he stays here we'll quarrel.

155
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,600
There's no cause to worry.
I'd tell you if there were.

156
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,320
Believe me, you can trust me.

157
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,880
Why don't you want us to go to Capri?

158
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,580
Because you're an ass.

159
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,480
You scare me, Paul.

160
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,270
- I've arrived earlier than I predicted.
- Do you need help?

161
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,180
Don't just stand there, answer me!

162
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,810
No, not necessary.

163
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,800
I'll just take two or three things.
Won't be long.

164
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,800
I'm in a hurry, Mary.

165
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,880
You go to Capri, Paul.

166
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,080
See you Saturday, OK?

167
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,010
Tell me...

168
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,800
about when I was little.

169
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,150
Again!

170
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,040
Go ahead.

171
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,290
You seem especially fond of hearing that.

172
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,600
You're right.

173
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,690
It's the strongest memory of love.

174
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,670
It's hard to recover that strength

175
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,550
without going backward.

176
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,160
It is thus.

177
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,080
You just have to be able
to give and accept.

178
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,600
I'll prepare something to eat.
See you downstairs.

179
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,960
Dry your hair well.

180
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,380
Mary!

181
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,160
Hello.

182
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,630
What's up?

183
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,870
I'm taking a train.

184
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,480
Where are you going?

185
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,140
To see my father.

186
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,240
Doesn't he live here?

187
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,710
Not right now.

188
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,680
- Your folks divorced?
- No, they're not.

189
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,740
- Is it your bear?
- Yes.

190
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,470
In any case...

191
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,030
I am glad my parents are not divorced.

192
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,160
You have no luck.

193
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,080
That's enough.

194
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,060
Hello, Mimi.

195
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,680
My name's not Mimi, it's Mary.

196
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,740
Where you going, Mimi?

197
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,610
To see my father.

198
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,880
That's right, he's gone away.

199
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,980
It's good for him, a little...

200
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,240
It's no big deal.

201
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,770
Of course not.

202
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,490
and you can travel with your bear,
so it's no trouble.

203
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,890
It's not a bear, it's a panther.

204
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,020
Certainly, you're right.

205
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,620
I'm a dumbbell about animals,
I don't know.

206
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,060
And where do you go?

207
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,080
Passing the time. I'm on relief.

208
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,800
I'm not working these days.

209
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,460
I stay at home.
I have a lot of housework,

210
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,890
I like my place to be clean,
you see.

211
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,980
- Get bored?
- Not at all, because...

212
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,390
I study my own case.

213
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,600
And I have my afternoons programmed.
I go out...

214
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:30,420
on my bike, my moped,
whatever you want to call it.

215
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,100
It takes me everywhere.

216
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,180
I get back at 7 or 9 in the evening.

217
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,140
If the weather is good, I take my time,

218
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,850
I stop where I please.

219
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,130
Forever damned be
the feckless dreamer

220
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,040
who, in his stupidity, first strove,

221
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,870
enamored of an insoluble
and sterile problem

222
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,580
to mix honesty with love.

223
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,580
Have you studied triangles?

224
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,620
We've just started.

225
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,410
I have to know the 4 types for Monday.

226
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,740
Know what a jagged line is?

227
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,220
One that changes direction.

228
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,160
Yes, but how?

229
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,380
By forming angles.

230
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,260
And an angle?

231
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,330
It's when the lines close.

232
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,900
And when they meet?

233
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,740
That's the vertex.

234
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,490
Also called an intersection.

235
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,310
An angle's like this.

236
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,770
Yes, but also like this.

237
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,890
No, it's like this.

238
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,100
To get that, you first need this.

239
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,800
All right.

240
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,940
There are 4 kinds of triangles.

241
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,520
The right-angle triangle,

242
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,980
It looks like this.

243
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,210
The side opposite the right angle
is the hypotenuse.

244
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,260
The equilateral triangle

245
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,570
is the one that has three equal sides.

246
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,460
The isosceles triangle

247
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,060
You listening, Mary?

248
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,700
The isosceles has two equal sides

249
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,900
and the scalene has three unequal sides.

250
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,020
Draw them, helps you
to remember them.

251
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,510
Are you hungry?

252
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,300
Yes, terribly.

253
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,300
Want a bite?

254
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,620
That the concerto I liked so much?

255
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,180
Yes, that's the one.

256
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,010
Don't recognize it?

257
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,930
Oh, yes.

258
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,430
No, not really, in fact.

259
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,090
Sounds like talk, don't you think?

260
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,290
People in a discussion.

261
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,330
Agreeing or disagreeing?

262
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,690
A bit of both.

263
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,410
Changes of mod, icy, exasperated,

264
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,650
I demand.

265
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,750
fire, fire, attention, error, horror, suffering...

266
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,860
Hey, calm down.

267
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,630
There's a Mahler symphony I can't find.

268
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,250
Ask mom for it next time.

269
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,300
OK.

270
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,620
Mary, bring your pajamas, too.

271
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,900
and don't forget your toothbrush again.

272
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,610
We've got to go now. It's time.

273
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,810
You ready?

274
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,070
What?

275
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,780
Mary.

276
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,750
Come, Mary.

277
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,290
Are you dead or just tired?

278
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,820
I am dead.

279
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,820
But everything that happens
should interest you.

280
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,600
You are so curious.

281
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,100
You surprise me.

282
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,940
It's not like before.

283
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,100
Nothing can stay the same.

284
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,830
It becomes,

285
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,660
It becomes,

286
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,340
It becomes different.

287
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,430
When a thing stops moving,

288
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,270
it's dead.

289
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,690
You must have confidence, Mary.

290
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,060
Sure, still, it's not like before.

291
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,620
In French, Mary is "Marie".
Know what it makes?

292
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,850
What?

293
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,210
A-I-M-E-R : to love.

294
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,250
Ah, yes.

295
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:12,130
You're beautiful!
Your dress is beautiful!

296
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,420
We'll be late. We must be going.

297
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,260
The hairdo becomes you.

298
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,600
Think so? It's not my favourite.

299
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,500
You're darling, really.

300
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,730
I'll leave you the number.

301
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,770
If something comes up, call.
Anyway I won't be home late.

302
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,540
Don't forget tomorrow.
I get to go out.

303
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,150
I haven't forgotten.

304
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,810
We should've gone already.

305
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,170
I have to go, dear.

306
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,420
Don't watch TV too late.

307
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,810
I'll kiss you when I come in.

308
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,740
Good bye.

309
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:26,010
It would be killing the unification
of Europe in the egg.

310
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,010
This business must be smothered,

311
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,670
in the egg.

312
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,930
Can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs.

313
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,740
So I don't know.

314
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,960
I don't know what to say.

315
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,900
Get lost!

316
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,740
It's the only way.

317
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:01,100
AT THAT TIME

318
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:23,300
HAIL MARY

319
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,970
Out of my mouth is shit.

320
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,440
Stop talking.

321
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,060
Then you stop eating.

322
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,900
AT THAT TIME

323
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,200
With you, silence can be unbearable.

324
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,370
We can get married, if you like.

325
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,300
I'm not afraid.

326
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,060
Maybe that could help us.

327
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,850
I wonder...

328
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,670
What?

329
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,770
All women want something unique.

330
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,860
Can't you see I’m not listening?

331
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,890
You know,

332
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,610
Men think they enter a woman.

333
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,000
AT THAT TIME

334
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,330
How are you doing with Mary?

335
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,540
That's my business.

336
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,900
... when there's a break-out, move fast.

337
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,250
I wondered if some event
would happen in my life.

338
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,060
I've had only the shadow of love,

339
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,890
in fact, the shadow of a shadow,

340
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:44,300
like the reflection of
a water-lily in a pond,

341
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,370
not quite, but shaken
by the ripples in the water,

342
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,800
so that even the reflection
is deformed and not yours...

343
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,370
Nevertheless,

344
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,620
So the sun, visible at last,

345
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,020
began to shine on the primeval oceans

346
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,090
and then, it's said, life appeared

347
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,440
entirely by chance.

348
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,890
There was hydrogen, nitrogen...

349
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,330
AT THAT TIME

350
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:29,160
What if it wasn't chance?
AT THAT TIME

351
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,100
AT THAT TIME

352
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,260
100 times that of the universe?

353
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,760
What does that mean?

354
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,700
That there was never time.

355
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,290
chance had no time.

356
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,840
Since life hadn't time to appear

357
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,830
On earth!

358
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,140
then it came from elsewhere,

359
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,080
from space.

360
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,530
We wonder what an
extra-terrestrial looks like.

361
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,100
Go to a mirror and look at yourself.

362
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,930
OK,

363
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,290
It's just a hypothesis, but...

364
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,340
Look at this dip.

365
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,330
It can only be explained...

366
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,690
by something in this cloud
intercepting light...

367
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,010
at a specific wavelength.

368
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,620
There's a bacteria,

369
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,820
of a very common sort,

370
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:36,380
that absorbs light at 3,4 microns.

371
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,630
That's its signature.

372
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,940
Any body, inert or alive,

373
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,620
leaves its special mark
on the electric field.

374
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,240
In my opinion,

375
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,290
this establishes

376
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,380
a very strong presumption

377
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,620
that life exists in space.

378
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,180
We're from there.

379
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,880
We are extraterrestrials.

380
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,180
we weren't born in
an amino acid soup.

381
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,930
suddenly, by chance.

382
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,280
No deal,

383
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,900
The figures say "no".

384
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,260
What if it wasn't chance?

385
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,890
Exactly.

386
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,170
The astonishing truth is

387
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,030
that life was

388
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,210
willed,

389
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:31,950
desired, anticipated, organized,
programmed by a determined intelligence.

390
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,800
Eve, stand behind Pascal.

391
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,840
My name's Eva.

392
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,860
Yes, stand behind Pascal
and cover his eyes.

393
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:47,000
They say it'd take
1.35 trillion years...

394
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,890
to find the solution blindfolded, but

395
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,110
if there's someone beside you
who can see,

396
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,660
and says no to every wrong move,

397
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,910
and yes to every move
toward a solution

398
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,900
at the rate of one move per second,

399
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,070
how long is needed?

400
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,070
2 minutes.

401
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:13,500
From 1.35 trillion years to 2 minutes.

402
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,340
That's what happened.

403
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,740
Memory!

404
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,470
Yes.

405
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,280
Yes.

406
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,240
Yes.

407
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,350
Yes.

408
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,350
No.

409
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,920
Yes.

410
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,430
Yes.

411
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,860
No. No.

412
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,480
Yes.

413
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,270
Yes.

414
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,750
Yes, yes.

415
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,250
Yes, yes. No.

416
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,570
Were you exiled for these ideas?

417
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,830
These... and others.

418
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,000
See you Monday.

419
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,020
Is the law of falling bodies
because life fell from the sky?

420
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,010
Yes, good bye.

421
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,110
Well!

422
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:12,850
Coming!

423
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,950
Like a drink at my
place one evening?

424
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:19,930
That's another story.

425
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,330
Your shoe, your shoe!

426
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,710
The question is if this creature
called man ever existed.

427
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:25,340
The man as he appears in legends...

428
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,540
is nothing more than a figment
of the popular imagination.

429
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,210
While there are Bourbons in Spain
there'll be no peace.

430
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,090
That's not your line, Uncle Gabriel!

431
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,040
Right!

432
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,340
- Straight ahead!
-Where's that?

433
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,190
Here's $500.

434
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,560
No, it's closed.

435
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,560
How about there?

436
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,180
No, there should be a house alongside.

437
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,600
What are you looking for?

438
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,200
Here! Here!

439
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,370
Stop at this station.

440
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,110
No, no.

441
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:26,840
Here's $500, for God's sake.

442
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,050
We'll be back!

443
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,700
You've a daughter, Mary?

444
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,010
- What's it about?
- Mary...

445
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,680
She's here!

446
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,890
For God's sake!

447
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,990
Mary, help!

448
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,190
- Mary!
- Mary!

449
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,570
Why are you here? We said Saturday.

450
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,820
Don't, dad, it's Joseph.

451
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,420
They brought me here.

452
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,220
I'm sick of your tricks.

453
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:34,940
Forget it!

454
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,490
OK, what is it?

455
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,380
It's you, Mary.

456
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,130
It's you, Mary.

457
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,650
What do you want?

458
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,290
and you?

459
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,220
and you?

460
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:16,970
What do you want?

461
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:20,600
What do you want?

462
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,900
And you, my lady?

463
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:32,510
Your fiancée?

464
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,620
What's it to you?

465
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:37,540
We couldn't care less.
But you're going to have a child.

466
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,430
By whom?

467
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,140
- You'll have a baby.
- I sleep with no one.

468
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:45,830
Mary, shit,

469
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,300
who are these people?

470
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,400
Go on! Straight ahead!
Here's $500.

471
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,210
By whom?

472
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:54,460
It won't be his, never!

473
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,400
By whom?

474
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,700
Don't play innocent!

475
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,740
By whom?

476
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:02,470
Mary.

477
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:06,660
Mary, be pure, be rough.
Follow thy way.

478
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,710
My way!

479
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,960
but the voice or the word?

480
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,580
Don't be silly!

481
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:18,160
I know where you're going
and soon you will too.

482
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,380
Don't forget!

483
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,240
Don't forget, what goes in, goes out.

484
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,220
And what goes out, goes in!

485
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,690
I am tired, shall we stop?

486
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,320
We each go on,

487
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:13,460
and each of us attains
what he can reach.

488
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:16,560
It's the last verse written by Hölderlin.

489
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,030
The last verse of earth.

490
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,020
Gracious.

491
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,330
Those ants are strictly
the invisible man.

492
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,260
I swear it was here!

493
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,620
You never find ants near water.

494
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:32,560
Wrong. Some ants seek gold.

495
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,340
I read Scientific American too.

496
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,700
What about these ants?

497
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,540
Olivier found an anthill.

498
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,900
He rigged wiring to warm
the ants in winter.

499
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,540
He wanted to keep them awake,

500
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,410
in winter,

501
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:51,610
hoping they'd use that leisure time,

502
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:52,980
- to invent things.
- What?

503
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:54,500
Music, maybe.

504
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:12,540
There's no escape.

505
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:41,770
What's this? Miracles don't exist.

506
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:44,810
Kiss me.

507
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:51,370
What's it all these? What's it?

508
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,940
There's no escape...

509
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,510
for us.

510
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:57,570
AT THAT TIME

511
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:59,770
Let's go on with our story;
AT THAT TIME

512
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:01,920
AT THAT TIME

513
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,000
Imagine...
AT THAT TIME

514
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,130
Imagine...

515
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,170
our descendants in
8 million years, 100 million.

516
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:11,940
Their wisdom and knowledge
are unimaginable today.

517
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,610
They suddenly notice

518
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,860
that the supposedly fixed
balance of the universe

519
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,490
is subtly changing.

520
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:37,180
Won't our descendants try
to preserve life?

521
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:39,490
Kiss me.

522
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,740
I kiss you, I do.

523
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:45,420
- Just once, Mary.
- You should trust me.

524
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,910
A prior intelligence programmed life.

525
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,460
It struggled to exist

526
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:20,100
in a pitiless universe.
It preserved life.

527
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:20,520
AT THAT TIME
in a pitiless universe.
It preserved life.

528
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:20,900
AT THAT TIME

529
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,260
How'd you think of it?

530
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,610
Because of computers.

531
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,740
When I think about it,

532
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:31,960
that computer intelligence stuns me.

533
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:44,450
If our distant descendants

534
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:49,730
decided to encode,

535
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:54,520
life as they know it

536
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:59,300
in a message of magnesium,

537
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,400
or boron,

538
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,650
or God knows what,

539
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:12,780
wouldn't they try to transmit the secret

540
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:13,830
of Creation?

541
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,970
Maybe the message has
always been clear.

542
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:23,860
Yes, that voice deep in our consciences

543
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:25,610
whispers, if we listen:

544
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:30,680
you're born of something,
somewhere else, in heaven.

545
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,850
Seek and you will find more

546
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,400
than you dream of.

547
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,410
Come to see the princess?

548
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,500
You can't fall any lower.

549
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:08,940
Who asked you?

550
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,740
Do I tell him to come?

551
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:14,940
Leave me alone.

552
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:21,630
Mary!

553
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:23,410
Why not tell the truth?

554
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,180
I am telling it!

555
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,190
Maybe the words come out wrong,

556
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,920
or it's my voice,

557
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,070
but it's the truth.

558
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,590
It'd be simpler if you said

559
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:35,170
you've seen other men.

560
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,820
I sleep with no one.

561
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,400
So where's the child from?

562
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:52,800
Where'll it come from?

563
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,730
Answer me.

564
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:06,820
Look at me!

565
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,590
I'm looking at you.

566
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,630
Child must come from somewhere

567
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,810
For two years now
I can't touch you, why?

568
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:21,340
- Kiss me!
- I do not know, Joseph.

569
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:24,650
By God! It's incredible.

570
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,000
Call or stop by the theatre.

571
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,060
- Please kiss me.
- Not that way.

572
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,190
I do kiss you, really.

573
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,380
You must be sleeping around.
It's the only answer.

574
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,850
Guys with big cocks!

575
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:57,760
We're through, Mary,

576
00:51:57,970 --> 00:51:58,910
Ciao.

577
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,190
Hi, you here too?

578
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,290
I keep dreaming.
Can't sleep. It wears me out.

579
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,430
Last night, before I went home,

580
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,580
I dreamed I had to paint
the whole building.

581
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:23,200
I thought: that'll take time.

582
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:25,930
That'll take time. I couldn't sleep.

583
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,130
Must be a reason.
You should make notes.

584
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:34,120
Yes, but I can't write, so I draw.

585
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:38,420
If it's a picture, you can't forget.

586
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:40,570
I must learn to write,

587
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,990
if I want to forget.

588
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:43,740
- That's it. Your dad well?

589
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,190
Yes, thanks.

590
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,390
Still pumping gas?

591
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:49,300
He wants out.

592
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,050
You getting married soon?

593
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,680
Broken up with Joseph?

594
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:00,510
He seemed serious.

595
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,890
Esther, the dossier of madam Malignon.

596
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,320
What's wrong, Mary?

597
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,810
I've got a pain!

598
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:16,460
In the belly.

599
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:19,660
We'll have a look.

600
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:21,660
Take her blood pressure, Esther.

601
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,540
Go next door and undress.
Be right there

602
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:29,900
Yes?

603
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,340
No.

604
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,740
Yes. No, not and no.

605
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,810
If you put on weight,

606
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,480
you'll be fine.

607
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,540
Does the soul have a body?

608
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:03,580
What do you mean, young lady,
the body has a soul.

609
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,100
I thought it was the opposite.

610
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:13,860
Doctor!

611
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,500
Doctor, I must be pregnant.

612
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,780
When was your last period?

613
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,060
Take off  your panties
and lie down there.

614
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,940
It's no use.

615
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,590
What?

616
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,050
I didn't hear you.

617
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,610
I've always wondered what
we know about a woman,

618
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:46,140
and I found that all you can know

619
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,690
is what a man already knew.

620
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,380
There's a mystery there.

621
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,740
Do you want this child?

622
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,140
Is it with Joseph?

623
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,580
It wasn't with anybody.

624
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,730
Some song and dance! Lie down.

625
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,100
It's no song and dance. I'm happy.

626
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:21,710
Now tell about your period.

627
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:25,810
I must examine you,
if you say it hurts.

628
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:28,250
It came normally, very intense.

629
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,320
- When?
- Friday.

630
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:33,470
Then quit being stupid. It's nothing.

631
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:36,860
See for yourself!
I haven't slept with anyone.

632
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,100
I touch no one.

633
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:46,740
Nobody caresses me.

634
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:52,580
I want you to see if
my baby's already there.

635
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:57,250
You're hiding something from us.

636
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:59,340
I'm not, I tell you.

637
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:01,430
You see.

638
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:08,100
I'm going to have a baby and
I haven't slept with a man.

639
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:11,820
Joseph won't believe it.

640
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:14,690
You tell him.

641
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,530
Lie still!

642
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:21,530
Will you hurt me?

643
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:23,100
Don't be afraid..

644
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,450
I was there when you were born.

645
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,770
Being a virgin should mean

646
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,890
being available

647
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:40,740
or free,

648
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:44,700
not being hurt.

649
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:50,230
Well, do you believe me?

650
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,930
do you believe me?

651
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:58,790
It's true that it's true.

652
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,780
Tell Joseph.

653
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,140
Esther!

654
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:18,620
May I get dressed?

655
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,300
It must be mine.

656
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:47,860
where to now?

657
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:50,100
Paradise villa, Hermance road.

658
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,610
I quit work at 5 p.m.

659
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:52,880
Sure, that's OK.

660
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:57,290
Is it in France?

661
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,860
It's very close, you'll see.

662
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,770
It's as pretty as Czechoslovakia.

663
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,220
Well?

664
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:15,760
Well!

665
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:59,170
Yet I rejoiced in giving
my body to the eyes...

666
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:02,880
of Him who has become
my Master forever,

667
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,500
and glanced

668
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,020
at this wonderful being.

669
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:13,860
For in truth, He was that,
then and always,

670
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:16,780
not for his looks nor what he did,

671
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,420
but in the silent power of what he was,

672
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,330
the power gathered up in him,
vast as a mountain on the sky

673
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,700
as unamontañaque raises haciael sky

674
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:29,330
that you can't measure or name,

675
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:32,320
but only feel.

676
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,770
Tonight?

677
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:43,250
No, I’ve a practice session.

678
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:45,300
OK, i'll go jump in the lake!

679
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,850
Oh, jump in the lake?

680
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,380
Ophelia's no role for you.

681
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,650
What are you talking about?

682
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:56,900
"To be or not to be..."
Don't know it?

683
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,020
I had to quit school when I was 12.

684
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:03,700
Sorry.

685
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:07,680
I  must go.

686
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,780
OK, i'll go jump in the lake!

687
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:11,580
No, stop it!

688
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,450
Yes?

689
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:28,250
Andrea.

690
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,700
What's on your mind?

691
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:43,260
Night changes its own look
and meaning.

692
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:47,770
Heidegger, "Three Lectures...

693
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:49,660
in the Bavarian Akademie".

694
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,760
- Winter of 59.
- Yes.

695
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:56,420
Know whay he wasn't shot?

696
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:02,100
As soon as we talk politics, you clam up.

697
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:04,380
It's OK, Andrea, you can leave.

698
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:08,660
It'certain, isn't it?

699
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:15,620
I think politics today...

700
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,000
must be the voice of horror.

701
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:21,300
The voice, but the way or the word?

702
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:26,180
The voice of horror,
of which nothing can be said.

703
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,170
Can I put this on?

704
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:30,490
what's it?

705
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,810
You can't find that in Prague.

706
01:01:59,140 --> 01:01:59,970
You OK?

707
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:07,840
A smoke, a sax solo,
that's all a man wants.

708
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:11,180
I often wonder that in music...

709
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,190
What?

710
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:20,540
We marvel at a new phrase, but,

711
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:24,050
really, there could be nothing.

712
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,960
This is the time.

713
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:41,980
And the place.

714
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:55,420
Yes?

715
01:02:56,590 --> 01:02:58,060
No, not tonight.

716
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:00,260
Not tonight.

717
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:19,310
I think the spirit acts on the body,
breathes through it,

718
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,040
veils it to make it fairer than it is.

719
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,500
For what is flesh...

720
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:26,620
alone?

721
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:33,790
I have business. I'll be in late.
Write down the pump figures.

722
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:34,770
Yes, dad.

723
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:40,980
What is flesh...

724
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:44,300
alone?

725
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:51,480
You may see it and feel only disgust.

726
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:55,660
You may see it in the gutter, drunken,

727
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:59,290
or in the coffin, dead.

728
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:04,330
The world is as full of flesh
as a grocer's counter

729
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:07,060
is full of candles at the start of winter.

730
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:11,200
But not until you've brought
a candle home

731
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,060
and lit it

732
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:15,400
can it give you comfort.

733
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:10,130
Come on.

734
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:19,680
Don't you like my body?

735
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:21,330
That's not it.

736
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:23,090
Then what?

737
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:28,170
Joseph!

738
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:31,820
It's because of her.

739
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:32,940
I don't know.

740
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,300
It's making me sick. I don't know.

741
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:43,220
I know, it's her.

742
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:48,810
It always is...

743
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:54,520
Mary.

744
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,140
I'm a real woman, too.

745
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,190
Yes.

746
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,220
I'd like to love you,
but I don't know how.

747
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:05,230
Let's go home.

748
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:06,210
Come on.

749
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:18,570
I'm coming.

750
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:31,200
You're complicating things,

751
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:36,660
don't you think?

752
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:38,460
If God exists, nothing's allowed.

753
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,170
- How?
- If God exists, nothing

754
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,730
is allowed.

755
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:43,690
What are you doing with that tramp?

756
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:46,520
No, uncle Gabriel.
Not like that!

757
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:49,300
When he's around, I forget
my lines! It's awful.

758
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:51,730
He's a real nothing. Got the list?

759
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:54,920
What list?

760
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,340
He wants to know everything.

761
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:00,580
Like everyone.

762
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:04,150
He doesn't even know
how to walk his dog.

763
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:05,170
Like everyone.

764
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,090
He's scared of the hole.

765
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,410
Like everyone.

766
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:10,730
He has no taste in ties.

767
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:13,850
- Yes, zero equals zero.
- He lacks trust.

768
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:15,430
That's no fault.

769
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:19,460
What's the common denominator
between zero and Mary?

770
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:21,620
Mary's body.

771
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,930
- Answer, nitwit.
- Dunno.

772
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:26,920
He wears blind man's glasses,
the dolt.

773
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,820
Try and follow the movement...

774
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:32,280
Not with your hand, your eyes!

775
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:34,530
She'll make a fool of me!

776
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:35,450
Look me in the eyes.

777
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:37,450
- If some guy's knocked her up...
- we are not "some guy".

778
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:38,340
I don't get it.

779
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:40,250
Have trust!

780
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:42,090
Trust!

781
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:43,190
I have none left.

782
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:45,980
And love, you jerk!

783
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:50,330
Love...

784
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:57,780
I'm going, ciao.

785
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:51,300
I've come.

786
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,970
What's wrong? Your eyes again?

787
01:08:57,750 --> 01:08:59,850
- What's the book?
- It's for you.

788
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,900
Into the maze of life goes
the dashing young man,

789
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:08,980
with the best horse, the finest armour
and the most beautiful clothes.

790
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:12,600
to be knight, lord, a great prince,
he wants it all.

791
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:17,170
But someone unseen awaits him
without weapon, title or pride : God!

792
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:22,900
Thanks a lot.

793
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:23,890
Don't want it?

794
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:25,260
I prefer mine.

795
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:26,770
Would've been a change.

796
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:28,290
I'll pass it up.

797
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:33,280
He's funny, he calls the rain "Sister Rain",

798
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:35,420
and the fire, "Brother Fire".

799
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:36,730
And the body?

800
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:39,890
What about the body?

801
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:43,250
The body...

802
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:45,940
The body...

803
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,930
The body, "Brother Donkey".

804
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,900
Why does my body repel you?
Don't say "I kiss you, I do".

805
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,740
I'm scared, too.

806
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:20,760
All this doen't happen every day.

807
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:26,700
So I am a bit scared.

808
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:31,020
One's better as a pair...

809
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:41,170
Why don't you believe the
spirit affected the body?

810
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:43,270
I believe the opposite.

811
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:47,840
That scares me.

812
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:52,740
At least say you don't love me.

813
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:58,370
I can't stand this silence.

814
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,580
Brother Silence.

815
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:14,730
I know you love me.
But it has to be something else.

816
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:18,100
You don't care if we see each other,
or if I’m sick or dead..

817
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:19,820
Am I alive?

818
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,170
Maybe I can only harm you.

819
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:26,350
I don't understand,.

820
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:30,220
I don't understand it.

821
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:34,960
Mary.

822
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:38,210
Are a great secret,

823
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:42,100
It's a big secret.

824
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:56,890
My love...

825
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:59,200
we don't know how to say it,

826
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:02,660
So immense

827
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:07,220
that all is consumed

828
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,460
and you'll leave me.

829
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,500
Anyway, I must know.

830
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:16,940
Know what?

831
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:32,660
The hand of god is upon me
and you cannot interfere.

832
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:36,400
What now?

833
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:49,650
I must go home.

834
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:51,180
There was no point in coming.

835
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:55,710
You body's not the snag,
but it's your lack of trust!

836
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:58,070
Why can't I want the child to be mine?

837
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,900
Tell me who you did it with,

838
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:02,530
I don't care, if you stay with me,

839
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:06,010
if I stay with you, sleep with you,
wake up with you.

840
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,490
And Juliette?

841
01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:14,100
I don't love her. I love you.

842
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,210
Very well.

843
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:29,500
Look.

844
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:37,980
Give me your hand.

845
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:39,860
Come on, by God.

846
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:42,670
There, feel.

847
01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:16,200
You see, I’m sleeping with no one.

848
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:22,390
But i'll still have a child.
You must believe it.

849
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:26,460
I'll only be your shadow.

850
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:33,100
God's shadow...
Isn't that what all men are...

851
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:35,930
for a woman who loves her man.

852
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,590
Let the soul be body...

853
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:50,410
Then no one can say the body is soul,
since the soul shall be body...

854
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:12,300
Thy will be done...

855
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:09,120
Yes, she's married.

856
01:16:09,230 --> 01:16:12,380
Then excuse me. Good bye, lady.

857
01:16:13,530 --> 01:16:14,370
Lady...

858
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:19,560
Who is it? I received your letter.

859
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:28,180
So basketball's like that.

860
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:31,210
Fatigue, victory,

861
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:33,610
fatigue.

862
01:16:39,450 --> 01:16:40,760
What did you mean by :

863
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:47,140
"That's not enough".

864
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,450
You said you could see I loved you.

865
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:00,220
Yes.

866
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:06,940
I see it.

867
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:09,150
But you said that's not enough.

868
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:10,990
You'll find something.

869
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,300
What do you do all day now?

870
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:16,170
Talk to me.

871
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:20,480
It's unbelievable, he never comes.

872
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:26,570
I've waited for 4 days,

873
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:33,700
I fixed the motor, put in
a phone and video.

874
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:35,910
It's all working.

875
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:43,420
He phones to say he's coming
but by evening he hasn't shown up.

876
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:50,260
Rich folks are weird.

877
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:52,260
AT THAT TIME

878
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:55,140
- Which one is it?
- The big white one there.

879
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,130
AT THAT TIME

880
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:58,130
- Can I go see it?
- Yes.

881
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:07,920
We're getting married,
can I see you naked...

882
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:10,590
just once.

883
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:13,690
I'll only look.

884
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:17,780
Yes...

885
01:18:21,770 --> 01:18:22,810
You'll look.

886
01:18:51,150 --> 01:18:52,770
It's been ages since I’ve had a...

887
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:54,510
normal conversation.

888
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:57,180
Yet nature prevails.

889
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:00,900
I want to talk, like others.

890
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:04,380
Because, though I hide it,
I'm in pain, like others.

891
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:06,260
Even a bit more.

892
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:36,020
They'll wrest from me that
which I dare not give.

893
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:41,630
You'll act chastely with me.

894
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:46,410
Don't take from someone
who enver took from you.

895
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:51,710
To be chaste is to know
every possibility,

896
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:53,140
without ever straying.

897
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,740
That's an impossible task.

898
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:02,970
To acomplist it, one has to admit...

899
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,460
that the stars we see at night

900
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:09,010
are vast worlds located
very far from ours

901
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:13,100
and everybody knows

902
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,940
that the stars are just lamps
hanging from the sky

903
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:19,730
most of which are very close to us.

904
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:26,460
For us may be the best explanation

905
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:30,930
of our origins is this idea
of another world

906
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:32,370
located farther in space.

907
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:35,540
It is only, he said,

908
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:39,300
a legendary deformation of
Horla's idea of the world

909
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:43,930
whose dogs knew of it
since ancient times.

910
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:47,820
Go, Arthur.

911
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:51,180
The time has come.

912
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,780
I'll go see the boss lady.

913
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:00,380
This time I think we've won.

914
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:22,060
I no longer wish to understand.

915
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:35,130
Does it matter what I am or am not?

916
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:37,820
No, not already.

917
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:51,970
We can't escape one another
any more than...

918
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:54,610
we can escape him.

919
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:40,980
Mary, what are you doing?

920
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:50,320
Mary stop it!

921
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:58,090
Joseph.

922
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:02,180
Joseph.

923
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:05,500
Joseph.

924
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,470
Tell me you love me.

925
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:12,660
- I love you!
- No!

926
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:20,300
I love you.

927
01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:22,380
No.

928
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:24,700
No.

929
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:30,670
- I love you.
- No.

930
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:36,740
But Maria, I love you.

931
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:39,180
No, no, no.

932
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:50,980
But why?

933
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:53,230
Why?

934
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,120
Because!

935
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:06,580
Because it is law.

936
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:17,740
- Got it?
- Yes.

937
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:20,310
I will sacrifice myself.

938
01:24:20,470 --> 01:24:21,830
Asshole!

939
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:24,780
First, a hole is not a hole.

940
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:27,210
And second: Taboo wipes out sacrifice.

941
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:31,730
But why?

942
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:33,620
Because he is the rule!.

943
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:51,420
Joseph,

944
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:54,570
I love you.

945
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:57,200
Mary.

946
01:24:58,350 --> 01:24:59,140
No.

947
01:25:13,570 --> 01:25:14,340
Yes.

948
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:16,770
Is that, I love you?

949
01:25:19,550 --> 01:25:20,070
Yes.

950
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:28,360
Is that it?

951
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:32,500
- That?
- Yes.

952
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:38,750
I love you.

953
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:39,900
Yes.

954
01:26:01,210 --> 01:26:03,100
Suddenly a light shone in my heart,

955
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:06,410
warm and gentle as a glowing fire...

956
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:10,920
What on earth, or even heaven,

957
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:15,380
beats knowing you please the one you love,
and who is your master.

958
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:20,220
I remember what he said about sin

959
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:22,200
as we watched the dragonflies:

960
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:26,810
if you thought of it rightly,
it just wasn't there.

961
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:31,460
It disappears like the covers of dragonflies

962
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,530
when they fight for their freedom.

963
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:43,400
We are speaking

964
01:26:43,610 --> 01:26:44,610
His word.

965
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:45,620
Mary.

966
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:47,530
How else can we be close...

967
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:50,220
to his word than by speaking it?

968
01:26:59,820 --> 01:27:00,660
Mary.

969
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:05,700
Yes, what?

970
01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:08,500
We're speaking

971
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:10,490
and we're speaking of the word

972
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:17,870
What we're speaking of, the word,
is always ahead of us.

973
01:27:38,230 --> 01:27:41,380
Then you won't leave me?

974
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:43,640
I'll stay.

975
01:27:52,710 --> 01:27:54,020
I'll never touch you.

976
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:03,470
I'll stay.

977
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,530
Don't believe the dollar will drop.

978
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,610
Don't believe the vacation will be fun.

979
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:28,500
You can believe rain falls downward.

980
01:28:28,810 --> 01:28:29,920
It's a law of nature.

981
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:33,180
The world is too sad!

982
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:36,060
It isn't sad, it's big.

983
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:38,940
I must go.

984
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:42,460
Don't I count for you?

985
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:44,290
My wife and son count too.

986
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:47,700
Now that I’ve a visa, I must go see
what's going on, no?

987
01:28:50,010 --> 01:28:50,980
Understand?

988
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:03,290
Till how much do your wife
and son count?

989
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:04,340
I don't get it.

990
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:07,210
Bastard!

991
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:12,730
I'm sorry.

992
01:29:12,730 --> 01:29:13,420
Doesn't matter.

993
01:29:14,570 --> 01:29:17,510
You say your wife's in jail,
and you sleep with me.

994
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:19,300
- Eve, please.
- Eva.

995
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:23,650
It's all over with Eve.
Go on, beat it, since
it's what you want.

996
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:29,540
Give me back my 32,000 francs.

997
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,610
I'll send it to you.

998
01:29:33,620 --> 01:29:34,980
You really are a nothing.

999
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:27,030
What makes a soul is its pain.

1000
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:31,810
He'll be the first to hear
my pain for them.

1001
01:30:33,070 --> 01:30:34,120
And he told me:

1002
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:37,930
Daughter, I’m suffocating
to see you suffocate.

1003
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:48,180
God's a creep, a coward who
won't fight,  who counts

1004
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:51,650
on ass alone, that is, on a
quiet heart, for existence

1005
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:53,820
an excess of ingress.

1006
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:56,420
I want no carnal joy:

1007
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:00,770
I don't want to wear out
my heart in one go,

1008
01:31:01,450 --> 01:31:02,740
or my soul, in one go.

1009
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:05,810
Even pain won't get me in one gone.

1010
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:08,130
and I will not disappear

1011
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:09,260
into it,

1012
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:11,950
but it will disappear with me.

1013
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,500
It will always be horrible

1014
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:55,970
for me to be the master,

1015
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:58,810
but there'll be no more sexuality in me.

1016
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:02,110
I'll know the true smile of the soul,

1017
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,110
not from outside,

1018
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:12,820
but from inside.

1019
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:16,650
Like a pain that's always deserved.

1020
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:51,820
It's not a matter of experience,
but of total disgust, total hatred.

1021
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:56,020
and not of morality or dignity.

1022
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:14,730
It's necessary

1023
01:33:14,730 --> 01:33:17,620
that the Father and Mother must fuck
to death over my body.

1024
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:20,920
Then Lucifer will die,

1025
01:33:22,290 --> 01:33:23,390
and we'll see...

1026
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,540
We'll see who's weariest,

1027
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:30,930
him,

1028
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:32,090
or me.

1029
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:38,930
Earth and sex are in us.

1030
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:42,020
Outside there are only stars.

1031
01:33:50,730 --> 01:33:53,380
Wanting isn't expanding by force.

1032
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:57,440
It's recoiling into oneself

1033
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:00,010
from level...

1034
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:01,900
to level, for eternity.

1035
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:10,350
You don't need a mouth-hole to eat with...

1036
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:14,920
and an asshole to swallow infinity.

1037
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:17,800
Your ass must go in your head

1038
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:21,020
and so descend to ass level,

1039
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:22,840
then go left,

1040
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:28,250
or right, to rise higher.

1041
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:36,660
God is a vampire who suffered me in him...

1042
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:38,780
because I suffered and he didn't,

1043
01:34:39,370 --> 01:34:41,010
and he profited from my pain.

1044
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:13,140
Mary is a body fallen from a soul,

1045
01:35:14,110 --> 01:35:18,510
I am a soul imprisoned by a body.

1046
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:23,130
My soul makes me sick at heart,
and it's my cunt...

1047
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:25,650
I am a woman...

1048
01:35:26,590 --> 01:35:29,060
though I don't beget my man
through my cunt.

1049
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:42,060
I am joy.

1050
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:48,160
I am she who is joy, and
need no longer fight it,

1051
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:50,580
or be tempted,

1052
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:53,460
but to gain an added joy.

1053
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:25,830
I am not resigned,

1054
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:29,090
resignation is sad.

1055
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,440
How can one be resigned
to god's will?

1056
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:36,280
Are we resigned to being loved?

1057
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,800
This seemed clear to me.

1058
01:36:40,210 --> 01:36:41,370
Too clear.

1059
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
AT THAT TIME

1060
01:40:09,050 --> 01:40:13,800
AT THAT TIME

1061
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:26,220
oh, Mary, what a strange road...

1062
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:28,210
I had to take to reach you.

1063
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:30,300
Now what's wrong?

1064
01:40:36,230 --> 01:40:37,120
Here they are!

1065
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:39,900
Do you believe it now?

1066
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:44,090
Will he call Joseph "dad"?

1067
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:49,260
What'll you do?

1068
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:54,620
Tell him later that's not his father?

1069
01:40:57,380 --> 01:40:58,420
That's life.

1070
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:00,520
Joseph.

1071
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:03,330
I came about the station.

1072
01:41:03,780 --> 01:41:04,670
We'll talk about it.

1073
01:41:05,190 --> 01:41:07,710
I figured it out,
I can pay it back in two years.

1074
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:13,900
Sure.

1075
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:24,700
- Yes.
- No.

1076
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:26,390
Dad, Joseph.

1077
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:28,180
Thank you very much, Mary.

1078
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:30,580
And why?

1079
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,970
For every woman.

1080
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:38,740
How did he look?
What was he like?

1081
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:41,100
There are no looks...

1082
01:42:41,430 --> 01:42:43,220
in love, no outward seeming,

1083
01:42:43,630 --> 01:42:44,780
no likeness.

1084
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:48,250
No, only our hearts will
tremble in the light.

1085
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:51,450
I can't describe him
as he stood there,

1086
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:55,450
but I can tell you how the women
looked on seeing him.

1087
01:42:56,850 --> 01:42:58,010
Come with me.

1088
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:03,410
Come with me.

1089
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:08,450
What's your name?

1090
01:43:08,450 --> 01:43:09,250
Fabian.

1091
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:13,070
Now you name's Peter.
And what's your name?

1092
01:43:13,170 --> 01:43:13,960
Florent.

1093
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:16,010
From now on your name's James.

1094
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:19,210
What's my name?

1095
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:22,830
Where's my coffee? I'm late.

1096
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:26,240
Where's my coffee?
Where's my coffee?

1097
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:37,050
Boys'd better be nice this morning.

1098
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:46,770
Or we won't play whale tonight.

1099
01:43:47,540 --> 01:43:48,730
Please, mom,

1100
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:49,800
let's play whale!

1101
01:43:51,210 --> 01:43:53,160
What's that called?

1102
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:58,300
The hedgehog, or the lawn.

1103
01:43:58,770 --> 01:44:00,500
What's that called?

1104
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:04,060
Bells.

1105
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:06,090
What's that called?

1106
01:44:09,530 --> 01:44:10,930
Loaves, bread...

1107
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:14,040
He's too old to see you naked now.

1108
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:18,700
"Quia respexit", Joseph.

1109
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:20,970
Someday, you know,

1110
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:24,690
he who is your father may forget you.

1111
01:44:26,370 --> 01:44:29,570
Then you'll regret I’m not around.

1112
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:43,770
Look at me!

1113
01:44:46,830 --> 01:44:48,930
I am He who is.

1114
01:44:49,090 --> 01:44:50,740
Quit clowning! Get in!

1115
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:51,730
No!

1116
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,820
I must tend to my father's affairs.

1117
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:58,580
By God, we'll see about that.

1118
01:45:00,270 --> 01:45:01,320
No, stop it!

1119
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:03,940
Stop it!

1120
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:06,570
He'll be back.

1121
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:20,310
When?

1122
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:21,470
At Easter.

1123
01:45:22,180 --> 01:45:23,410
or Trinity Sunday.

1124
01:45:55,660 --> 01:45:56,570
Lady...

1125
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:02,920
Hello, lady!

1126
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:05,230
What is it?

1127
01:46:05,230 --> 01:46:08,320
Nothing. Hail, Mary.

1128
01:47:36,110 --> 01:47:37,580
I am of the Virgin,

1129
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:40,720
and I didn't want this being.

1130
01:47:41,770 --> 01:47:43,400
I only left my imprint on
the soul that helped me.

1131
01:47:44,450 --> 01:47:45,220
That's all.
