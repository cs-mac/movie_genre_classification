1
00:00:13,734 --> 00:00:14,933
<i>It's like</i>

2
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:16,702
<i>he's sort of going through</i>
<i>a mid-life crisis</i>

3
00:00:16,802 --> 00:00:18,836
<i>but it's been lasting about 10 years.</i>

4
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,267
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>do you think</i>

5
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:22,168
<i>he's actually got any musical talent?</i>

6
00:00:22,268 --> 00:00:23,966
<i>Well, I mean,</i>
<i>he's all right.</i>

7
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,268
<i>He can play the guitar</i>
<i>a bit and all that,</i>

8
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,335
<i>but he's so into country and western.</i>

9
00:00:28,435 --> 00:00:29,700
<i>I mean, it was all right</i>

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,735
<i>when he was into progressive</i>
<i>rock and everything.</i>

11
00:00:31,835 --> 00:00:33,686
<i>I didn't mind that at all, you know,</i>

12
00:00:33,786 --> 00:00:35,578
<i>but we're just so different now.</i>

13
00:00:35,678 --> 00:00:37,435
<i>I like Missy Elliot,</i>
<i>I like Lil' Kim</i>

14
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:39,367
<i>and I don't think</i>

15
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:41,202
<i>Dolly Parton's had much</i>
<i>to say for herself</i>

16
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:43,434
<i>for a long time,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

17
00:00:43,534 --> 00:00:46,302
<i>How are things between you, Carol,</i>

18
00:00:46,402 --> 00:00:47,636
<i>in the bedroom department?</i>

19
00:00:47,736 --> 00:00:49,636
<i>I won't let him in the house,</i>

20
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:51,602
<i>so I'm not going to let him</i>

21
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:53,000
<i>in the bedroom,</i>
<i>am I?</i>

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,902
<i>Well, if he's not even</i>
<i>allowed in the house</i>

23
00:00:55,002 --> 00:00:56,167
<i>I reckon there's a great deal</i>

24
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:57,836
<i>the two of you need to talk about.</i>

25
00:00:57,936 --> 00:00:59,033
Fucking Vanessa.

26
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:00,569
<i>All right,</i>
<i>I think it's time</i>

27
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:02,100
<i>we welcomed</i>

28
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,001
<i>Carol's partner, Charlie.</i>

29
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:10,868
Howdy, folks.

30
00:01:13,033 --> 00:01:16,601
* I am the Midlands cowboy *

31
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:20,167
* I go from town to town *

32
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:22,735
* I wear my boots and Stetson *

33
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:25,268
* And the bad guys Wear a frown *

34
00:01:25,368 --> 00:01:27,419
* I sing my songs *

35
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,500
* I right the wrongs *

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,001
* I wear this great apparel *

37
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:32,500
* Most of all *

38
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,934
* I wanna sing
About my love for Carol **

39
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:40,801
<i>Thank you.</i>

40
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,936
<i>I think he sounds a bit selfish,</i>

41
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,300
<i>and I think you need</i>

42
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,651
<i>to start taking on</i>
<i>some responsibility, Charlie.</i>

43
00:01:46,751 --> 00:01:48,968
<i>How can you call me selfish?</i>
<i>You don't know me.</i>

44
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,367
<i>I mean, I'm great with my kids.</i>

45
00:01:50,467 --> 00:01:52,085
<i>I get them up,</i>
<i>make their breakfast.</i>

46
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:53,769
<i>I pack their lunch,</i>
<i>take them to school.</i>

47
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:55,368
<i>I pick them up,</i>
<i>I bathe the lads-</i>

48
00:01:55,468 --> 00:01:56,667
<i>But you need to earn money.</i>

49
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:57,901
<i>What do you know about it?</i>


50
00:01:58,001 --> 00:01:59,169
<i>You've probably got no kids.</i>


51
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:00,367
<i>Who'd want kids with you?</i>

52
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:02,300
<i>Oh, I can't have you...</i>

53
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,902
<i>I can't have you insulting my audience.</i>

54
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:05,368
<i>Well,</i>
<i>she's insulted me.</i>

55
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:06,400
<i>I hope he doesn't</i>

56
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,035
<i>talk to you like that at home, Carol.</i>

57
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:09,119
<i>No, no.</i>

58
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:10,133
Fuck, Carol.

59
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:11,968
<i>Don't get me wrong,</i>
<i>he is a good dad.</i>

60
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:13,769
<i>He's the best dad</i>
<i>in the world, you know?</i>

61
00:02:13,869 --> 00:02:15,267
<i>I've got my daughter,</i>
<i>Donna.</i>

62
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:16,702
<i>He's not the father of Donna, right,</i>

63
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:18,100
<i>but he took me and Donna in</i>

64
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,168
<i>when she was a little girl</i>
<i>and all that,</i>

65
00:02:20,268 --> 00:02:21,469
<i>and he's an absolute diamond</i>

66
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:22,467
<i>and I love him.</i>

67
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:23,936
<i>I've been with him all this time...</i>

68
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:25,467
Bad sister.

69
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:26,500
<i>but the thing is,</i>

70
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,302
<i>I'm sort of getting to the age now</i>

71
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:29,802
<i>that he was when we met</i>

72
00:02:29,902 --> 00:02:31,434
<i>and I sort of think...</i>

73
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:32,834
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

74
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:35,068
<i>He's going backwards and I'm</i>
<i>trying to move us on...</i>

75
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:36,233
Charlie, man.

76
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,535
<i>Well, you say he's a great father,</i>

77
00:02:38,635 --> 00:02:39,667
<i>and as it so happens,</i>

78
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:41,535
<i>we've got your best friend, Shirley,</i>

79
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:42,734
<i>her daughter,</i>
<i>Marlene,</i>

80
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:44,235
<i>and your older daughter, Donna,</i>

81
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:45,736
<i>all waiting backstage.</i>

82
00:02:45,836 --> 00:02:47,234
<i>Come on out, girls!</i>

83
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:53,133
Oh, fuck.

84
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:57,267
Hi, girls. Welcome.

85
00:02:57,367 --> 00:02:59,468
Shirley, you're Carol's very
good friend. Do you think...

86
00:02:59,568 --> 00:03:01,919
I mean, there's obviously
a lot of love going on here.

87
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:04,335
Do you think they stand
a chance of making it together?

88
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,600
Um, I don't know.

89
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,635
<i>I think they're both</i>
<i>a bit mixed up, really.</i>

90
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:09,966
Ah, baby.

91
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:12,035
<i>You think they're confused?</i>

92
00:03:12,135 --> 00:03:13,535
Yeah, a bit, yeah.

93
00:03:13,635 --> 00:03:14,966
<i>Not as confused</i>

94
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:16,235
as you're going to be, Shirley,

95
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:17,200
because...

96
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,268
Could we dim the lights, please?

97
00:03:19,368 --> 00:03:21,267
We've got a surprise for you.

98
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,968
Where do you think
your boyfriend Dek is now,

99
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:25,200
Shirley?

100
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,000
Um, he's waiting with the car.

101
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,836
You think he's waiting with the car.

102
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:32,434
You're entirely wrong,

103
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:35,033
because, ladies and gentlemen,
let's welcome Dek!

104
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:48,235
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

105
00:03:48,335 --> 00:03:50,000
Fanny.

106
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,067
<i>What are you doing?</i>

107
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,500
Oh, God.

108
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,202
It's been a year
and a half now, Shirley,

109
00:04:01,302 --> 00:04:04,368
that we've been together.

110
00:04:04,468 --> 00:04:07,302
What are you doing?

111
00:04:07,402 --> 00:04:09,167
Oh, my God.

112
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:11,168
Shirley, you're a better woman

113
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:12,567
than I could ever be.

114
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,734
No, than I could ever be with.

115
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:22,268
You're a wonderful,
fantastic mother.

116
00:04:22,368 --> 00:04:25,033
You're beautiful.

117
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:28,035
I love your hair and your little hands

118
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:32,035
and your eyes,
both of them,

119
00:04:32,135 --> 00:04:34,400
and...

120
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,066
you're a role model and an idol

121
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,101
and you're something to gaze down on

122
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:41,367
like a...

123
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:42,702
like a piece of nice art...

124
00:04:42,802 --> 00:04:45,567
Oh, God.

125
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:47,500
and I hope you'll make me

126
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,101
the happiest man in Britain today

127
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:54,100
by saying yes

128
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,901
when you ask me to marry you.

129
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,268
Dek, I can't believe
you're doing this now.

130
00:05:06,368 --> 00:05:08,300
Yes?

131
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,135
Yes, Shirley.

132
00:05:11,235 --> 00:05:13,302
Yes.

133
00:05:13,402 --> 00:05:15,467
Please?

134
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:23,133
<i>I can't, Dek. No.</i>

135
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,234
<i>There'll be more Face To Feltz</i>
<i>after the break.</i>

136
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,334
Fuck it.

137
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:41,634
Fuck it.

138
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:50,534
No, ta.

139
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:11,000
I got her to sign a T-shirt,
you know.

140
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:23,719
I was singing on the TV show

141
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,868
when Shirley,
she said no.

142
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,367
Stop it.

143
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:35,434
It's not funny.

144
00:06:35,534 --> 00:06:37,101
Watch my bloody hat.

145
00:06:37,201 --> 00:06:38,834
Come on, Dek.

146
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:04,968
See you, Charlie.

147
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:48,966
You all right,
Marlene?

148
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:51,869
Yeah, I just feel a bit sorry for Dek.

149
00:08:51,969 --> 00:08:52,933
Don't be daft.

150
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,569
You didn't do nothing.

151
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:56,434
I did, Mum.

152
00:08:56,534 --> 00:08:58,818
I helped him write that poem.

153
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:01,133
Marlene, why didn't you tell me?

154
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:04,767
I just wanted people
to think I'd got a dad.

155
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:11,268
Hey, I really like Dek.

156
00:09:11,368 --> 00:09:12,767
I know you do.

157
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:13,902
It's just not that simple,

158
00:09:14,002 --> 00:09:15,253
you know?

159
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:16,601
I know.

160
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:24,335
I know what you're doing,
talking about me.

161
00:09:24,435 --> 00:09:25,734
Can we talk, please?

162
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:27,168
I can't now.
I'm late for work.

163
00:09:27,268 --> 00:09:28,569
Don't go off like this, eh?

164
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:29,936
I can't fake it, Shirley.

165
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,434
You've wounded me.

166
00:09:33,868 --> 00:09:35,836
See, I'm a laughing stock,
aren't I?

167
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:36,966
No, you're not.

168
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:39,001
Yes, I am, Shirley. Yes, I am!

169
00:09:39,101 --> 00:09:41,001
Come and sit down, please.

170
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:42,333
Sit down?

171
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:44,435
Sit down in my own house
and be laughed at?

172
00:09:44,535 --> 00:09:45,700
No way, Shirley!

173
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,100
I'm going to work now.

174
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,802
At least thereI'm going to get
a little bit of respect.

175
00:09:51,902 --> 00:09:54,734
Have a nice day.

176
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:57,033
Emerson,
put these on him.

177
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,601
Boys, are you in that bathroom yet?

178
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:05,634
Come on. You better be
in there, you know.

179
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:09,434
Not this again.

180
00:10:09,534 --> 00:10:11,667
You little buggers,
what have I told you?

181
00:10:11,767 --> 00:10:14,133
I've told you time and time
again, don't be doing that.

182
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:16,868
Otherwise I'm going to send you
to your dad's, up to the pit.

183
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:19,402
Come on, you've got to get up.

184
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:20,567
I can't take much more.

185
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,467
You should have put a lock on the door,

186
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:24,585
shouldn't you?
They can pick the lock, Carol.

187
00:10:24,685 --> 00:10:26,634
Phoar, it stinks in here.
Come on, get up.

188
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:29,018
I want to put this duvet cover
in the washing machine.

189
00:10:29,118 --> 00:10:31,368
Oh, no! Oh, Donut, where's
the back of your knickers?

190
00:10:31,468 --> 00:10:33,535
No, stop!
Look at that, look at that!

191
00:10:33,635 --> 00:10:35,036
What's going on in here?

192
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:36,467
Donut, how could you?

193
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,219
You can fucking have him!

194
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:39,936
I knew you fancied him.

195
00:10:40,036 --> 00:10:41,700
Get in there.

196
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,602
Get in that bathroom.

197
00:10:44,702 --> 00:10:46,167
I love you.

198
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:47,333
There's only you.

199
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:48,769
Are any of us in the paper?

200
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:49,801
No!

201
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:51,567
Is that you, Texas?

202
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:53,767
Yeah, we're working Saturday,
okay?

203
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:55,869
Yeah, yeah,
the old colliery club, yeah.

204
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:58,153
No, they've put their money
down a few quid,

205
00:10:58,253 --> 00:11:00,402
but apparently they're
not doing much business

206
00:11:00,502 --> 00:11:01,836
since the pit closed.

207
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:03,200
Okay, Texas?

208
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,968
See you Saturday, kid.

209
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:07,267
Yahoo!

210
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:12,066
Get off the car, Donut.

211
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,135
Lean against the wall
or on the curb or something.

212
00:11:14,235 --> 00:11:15,535
Don't flipping flop all over the car.

213
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:16,634
You know the rules.

214
00:11:16,734 --> 00:11:18,502
I've got things on my mind, Dek.

215
00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:20,200
So have I, so have I.

216
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:25,300
Don't slam the door.

217
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:29,819
You ever worn a thong, Dek?

218
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,901
* They're on the road again *

219
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:38,133
* They're on the road again *

220
00:12:27,968 --> 00:12:29,500
Fucking brilliant, eh?

221
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,669
Did you feel the brakes on that?

222
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:33,053
Hey, you forgot something.

223
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:34,367
How was it in the back, Billy?

224
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:36,368
Superb. Weren't it comfy?
Aye, great.

225
00:12:36,468 --> 00:12:38,335
That's real mock-leather,
by the way.

226
00:12:38,435 --> 00:12:39,367
Is it?

227
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,669
Yeah, and did you open
any of the presents

228
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:42,767
while you were there as well?

229
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,934
Fucking shite!

230
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:02,118
Fucking hell, man.

231
00:13:02,218 --> 00:13:03,700
Where the fuck is he?

232
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,769
It was me that stole the car
full of presents.

233
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,136
Jimmy, come on.

234
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:08,420
Hey, Jimmy!
Ta-da!

235
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,634
Is that you, you fanny?

236
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:11,985
Get in the car.
You're driving, come on.

237
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:14,302
What the fuck is it?
A fucking Mini on acid?

238
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:15,867
Aye, that'll be fucking right.

239
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:18,202
Come on, Jimmy,
hurry up, would you?

240
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:20,233
Jumbo, you fucking...

241
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,968
You're sitting on...
Look at that.

242
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,069
Tickets to the Krankies.

243
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:26,167
They're mine.
I want them.

244
00:13:29,634 --> 00:13:32,936
This isn't happening, man.

245
00:13:33,036 --> 00:13:34,367
It's all the waiting.

246
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:36,335
I've been planning
this heist for months.

247
00:13:36,435 --> 00:13:38,968
We've got one chance.

248
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,985
Anybody fancy a McChuckle burger?

249
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:44,702
I'm fucking starving,
by the way.

250
00:13:44,802 --> 00:13:45,801
Aye.
Aye.

251
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:47,801
I'm hungry as well.

252
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:49,302
No, you can't have a Chuckle McBurger.

253
00:13:49,402 --> 00:13:50,919
Why not?

254
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:52,467
Whoa, whoa.

255
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:53,934
Here we go, boys.

256
00:13:56,434 --> 00:13:58,002
On three.

257
00:13:58,102 --> 00:13:59,602
One, two...

258
00:13:59,702 --> 00:14:02,467
three.

259
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:08,469
Oh, excuse me, pal.
Give us the money.

260
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:09,834
Fuck off.

261
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,569
Give us the fucking case.
Fuck off.

262
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:13,136
Give us the fucking case!

263
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:14,701
Fuck off.
Give us the case!

264
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:33,434
Let it go,
you fucking twat.

265
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:37,300
One-two, Dougy, one-two.

266
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:41,135
That's the fucking busies.

267
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:43,133
Move!

268
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:44,367
Come on, then.

269
00:14:50,701 --> 00:14:51,701
Come on, Billy!

270
00:14:56,234 --> 00:14:57,202
Ah, fuck this.

271
00:14:57,302 --> 00:14:58,167
Jimmy!

272
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:00,469
Jimmy, you fucking bastard!

273
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:02,100
Wait till I get you!

274
00:15:04,434 --> 00:15:07,234
Run! Run for your life!

275
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,785
Come on, lads.
Flipping heck.

276
00:15:14,885 --> 00:15:16,801
You're wearing the tread on them.

277
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:24,400
Can you put me through

278
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,368
<i>to the Face To Feltz guest help line?</i>

279
00:15:28,468 --> 00:15:30,600
Yes.

280
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,985
That's right, yeah,
she turned me down.

281
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:37,335
Yeah, so how do we go about this now?

282
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:38,500
Do we...

283
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,735
Is it I talk and you listen
and then you...

284
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:42,867
When I stop,

285
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:44,634
you tell me what's wrong with me?

286
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:49,869
Okay, then shall I start now?

287
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:53,567
Come on, Jimmy.

288
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,502
They'd have done the same thing, man.

289
00:15:56,602 --> 00:15:59,434
Fuck,
they'd seen your face, man.

290
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:04,469
Seen a bit of your face.

291
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:05,834
Ah, fuck it.

292
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:07,769
Fuck them, man.
They're bastards anyway.

293
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:09,786
Bet they've fucking
grassed you up already.

294
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,769
Fucking face it, man.
They're fucking scumbags.

295
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:15,200
I mean, you know it, I know it.
Huh? Huh?

296
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:37,268
Jesus Christ, man.

297
00:16:37,368 --> 00:16:38,667
Fucking...

298
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:41,418
Fucking face-painting money.

299
00:16:41,518 --> 00:16:44,135
Thanks very much, Mr. Plonko.

300
00:16:44,235 --> 00:16:46,467
See you later,

301
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,834
MiniMini,
fucking piece of shit.

302
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:03,802
I feel like a father
to her daughter Marlene,

303
00:17:03,902 --> 00:17:06,702
and we're very much in love.

304
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:08,186
Very much.

305
00:17:08,286 --> 00:17:09,600
Well, we were.

306
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,068
Well, we still are very much in love

307
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:15,035
and she means the world to me.

308
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:17,334
She's an angel.
She's...

309
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,601
Nottingham, mate?

310
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:08,501
Hello.

311
00:18:16,901 --> 00:18:19,602
Where did you get your outfit from?

312
00:18:19,702 --> 00:18:22,869
Just bought it on the way home.

313
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:26,167
Did you?

314
00:18:26,267 --> 00:18:27,700
Do you like it?

315
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,767
Yeah, I like it a lot, yeah.

316
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:33,966
Nice.

317
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:36,402
Dek, are you still in love with me?

318
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:39,268
Are you still in love with me?

319
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,066
What?

320
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,785
Of course I am. Don't be stupid.

321
00:18:43,885 --> 00:18:45,944
Because I'm in love with you.

322
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:48,107
I'm still in love with you.

323
00:18:48,207 --> 00:18:50,267
I love you.
I love you.

324
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:55,302
I'm sorry I said no.

325
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:56,367
No-

326
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:58,467
No, I am.

327
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:06,735
Is it all right?

328
00:19:06,835 --> 00:19:08,234
Yeah.

329
00:19:23,267 --> 00:19:24,267
Oh, my God,

330
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:25,734
I'm getting so many looks.

331
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:27,869
Did you pay for them drinks?
You did, didn't you?

332
00:19:27,969 --> 00:19:29,200
Yeah, we ain't famous, Carol.

333
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,135
We're the only ones here
that have been on the telly.

334
00:19:32,235 --> 00:19:35,035
We saw you lot on the telly.
Oh, I'd have died, Shirl.

335
00:19:35,135 --> 00:19:37,066
Didn't you know he
were going to do that?

336
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,335
No, I didn't know.
We don't blame you, though.

337
00:19:39,435 --> 00:19:41,068
He's not a patch on your last fella.

338
00:19:41,168 --> 00:19:42,233
We were saying,
weren't we?

339
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,869
Yeah, it's not really
your business, is it?

340
00:19:43,969 --> 00:19:48,600
Oh. Well, excuse me for breathing.

341
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,435
Yeah, well,
at least someone asked her,

342
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:51,834
you bloody swamp monster.

343
00:19:51,934 --> 00:19:53,635
She gets on my nerves, that one.

344
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,333
Anyone want a lucky pen?

345
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:57,834
Hello, is that Perfect Pizzas?

346
00:19:57,934 --> 00:19:59,868
Hello, Zak, lad,
are you all right?

347
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,869
No, I'm just writing
a couple of tunes, you know.

348
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,200
Yeah, no, I'm in on my own.

349
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,534
Can you send me a 12 incher
'round, please, son?

350
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:13,402
Yeah, and I know what I'd like
to do with it too.

351
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:15,067
Thanks a lot, kid.

352
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:18,868
Oh, I'm sorry,
darling.

353
00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:25,001
What's wrong with me tonight?
For God's sake. Where is it?

354
00:20:25,101 --> 00:20:27,435
Huh?
Where is it? Is it behind you?

355
00:20:27,535 --> 00:20:29,168
Where's what? What?
This.

356
00:20:29,268 --> 00:20:30,200
What?

357
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,667
Yeah, this.
Yeah?

358
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:33,435
Yeah, this lad at
school's got one, Dek.

359
00:20:33,535 --> 00:20:34,867
Just take it to work or something.

360
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,335
If you're bored, play
with your binoculars.

361
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,300
What?

362
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,602
Just play with them,
whatever.

363
00:20:38,702 --> 00:20:39,667
All right.

364
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:41,535
I won't see anything anyway. It's dark.

365
00:20:41,635 --> 00:20:43,368
Stop sayin' that.
Okay, I'm doing it.

366
00:20:43,468 --> 00:20:44,769
I'm going to do it now.

367
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,000
All right.
Go on.

368
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:51,701
I can't see anything.

369
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:56,333
Why are you laughing?

370
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:58,802
Oh, you're just dead funny, Dek.

371
00:20:58,902 --> 00:21:01,033
I know.

372
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:06,569
<i>Skegness is my heaven,</i>
<i>it's number 37.</i>

373
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:08,586
Come on, it's destiny, isn't it?

374
00:21:08,686 --> 00:21:10,569
<i>Chips and curry on a plate,</i>

375
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:11,534
<i>38.</i>

376
00:21:11,634 --> 00:21:13,534
What do you need?
39.

377
00:21:13,634 --> 00:21:14,635
<i>Telling lies is naughty,</i>

378
00:21:14,735 --> 00:21:16,101
<i>40.</i>

379
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:17,066
Yes!

380
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,267
<i>We have a winner.</i>

381
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:20,267
Oh, bloody hell,
it's the swamp monster.

382
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:22,302
What are you looking at?
Do you want a picture?

383
00:21:22,402 --> 00:21:23,567
Just leave it, Carol.

384
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:25,200
No, I'm fed up with this bingo lark.

385
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,300
I'll tell you what.
This town's a bit too small-

386
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:30,100
You twat!

387
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,867
That really hurt.

388
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:34,502
I'm going to the toilet.
Come on, move.

389
00:21:34,602 --> 00:21:35,769
Watch the drinks.

390
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:36,966
Ah, fuck the drinks.

391
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:38,501
I'm going to need a stitch in this.

392
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:45,534
Carol, wait up for us.

393
00:21:45,634 --> 00:21:46,801
Stop being so bloody mardy.

394
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:49,418
Shut up. I've got a hole
in the back of my head.

395
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:52,001
You've got hole in the front
of your head as well.

396
00:21:52,101 --> 00:21:53,233
Cheeky.
Hold on.

397
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,936
That's how tumors start, you know.

398
00:21:55,036 --> 00:21:56,033
Don't be stupid.

399
00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:57,401
Yeah, you won't be laughing

400
00:21:57,501 --> 00:21:58,952
when I start spazzing out

401
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:00,501
and frothing at the mouth.

402
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,335
* Oh, I'm on the trail
I've escaped from jail *

403
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:50,767
* And I'm looking For Texas Tom *

404
00:22:52,234 --> 00:22:54,702
Come on, kids.

405
00:22:54,802 --> 00:22:55,933
Mum, hey.

406
00:22:56,033 --> 00:22:57,902
What's the matter with you?
My socks are itchy.

407
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,319
Can I go back and change them, Mum?

408
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,677
No, you can't.
They're all right.

409
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:01,966
Here's your bag. Take your bag.

410
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:03,902
Give me that ball.
You're late, you.

411
00:23:04,002 --> 00:23:05,369
Well, bloody sue me, then.

412
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:06,802
Come on, boys.
Let's go.

413
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:08,336
Mind your fingers.

414
00:23:08,436 --> 00:23:09,801
All right, Marlene.

415
00:23:09,901 --> 00:23:11,333
Dad, my socks are itchy.

416
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,302
Ah, well, I'll sort it out after.

417
00:23:13,402 --> 00:23:14,836
File a complaint.

418
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:17,267
See you.

419
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:18,868
Okay, kids,
here we go.

420
00:23:18,968 --> 00:23:20,435
* Oh, I'm an old cowpoke *

421
00:23:20,535 --> 00:23:21,901
* I'm always broke *

422
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:25,785
* I'm taking the kids Off to school *

423
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:29,994
* Give him two arms To cling to *

424
00:23:30,094 --> 00:23:34,282
* And something warm To bring you *

425
00:23:34,382 --> 00:23:38,535
* When the nights Are cold and lonely *

426
00:23:38,635 --> 00:23:42,500
* Stand by your man *

427
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,768
* And tell the world You love him *

428
00:23:47,868 --> 00:23:53,001
* He's giving All the love he can *

429
00:23:53,101 --> 00:23:54,700
* Ooh, baby *

430
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,469
Charlie, wait.
Charlie, can you just...

431
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,136
Bloody hell, Jimmy,
you frightened

432
00:23:59,236 --> 00:24:00,801
the bloody life out of me there.

433
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:07,100
What the hell's going on, Jimmy?

434
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,135
You frightened the life
out of the bloody kids there.

435
00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:11,035
Get out, you dopey bugger.
Go on-

436
00:24:11,135 --> 00:24:12,434
No offense, Charlie.

437
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,502
No offense? What the bloody
hell are you playing at?

438
00:24:14,602 --> 00:24:16,252
I didn't have anywhere to sleep, man.

439
00:24:16,352 --> 00:24:17,968
Didn't you? Well,
I'm sorry about that,

440
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:19,567
but that's not my bloody fault.

441
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,567
I'm sorry. I just needed
to see her, you know-

442
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:23,802
Well, she doesn't want
to see you like this, does she?

443
00:24:23,902 --> 00:24:25,467
She's my daughter, Charlie.
I know she's your-

444
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:27,869
Jimmy, I'm sorry, but look,
we've got to get off, okay?

445
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:29,267
She's my wee lassie, Charlie.

446
00:24:39,734 --> 00:24:41,601
Fuck!

447
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:44,634
How did Jimmy look?

448
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:47,435
Jimmy's Jimmy,
isn't he?

449
00:24:47,535 --> 00:24:48,567
Oh, aye.

450
00:24:50,467 --> 00:24:51,901
Where's my air rifle?

451
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:55,133
Oh, come on, don't be soft, Dek.
Sit yourself down.

452
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:02,634
You told me he was in prison,
Carol.

453
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,135
I believed you.
Hang on. I never said that.

454
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:06,567
Yes, you did,
you big, fat liar.

455
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:08,435
Hey, come on, there's
no need for that, Dek.

456
00:25:08,535 --> 00:25:09,867
Well, he's her brother, Charlie.

457
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,101
Yeah, well, he's her ex as well,
in case you'd forgotten.

458
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:14,302
Did you know about this, Shirl?

459
00:25:14,402 --> 00:25:15,634
No.

460
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,500
We should call the police.

461
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,552
He's probably after Marlene now,
ain't he?

462
00:25:24,652 --> 00:25:26,569
This is my brother we're talking about.

463
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:27,734
He's only your foster brother.

464
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:29,202
He could have
Hannibal Lecter's DNA strands

465
00:25:29,302 --> 00:25:30,767
for all we know.

466
00:25:30,867 --> 00:25:33,234
You bastard.
Don't you dare say that.

467
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:38,534
Get off. He bloody gets on my nerves.

468
00:25:38,634 --> 00:25:40,368
Out of order there, Dek.
You're out of order.

469
00:25:40,468 --> 00:25:43,133
Welsh wanker.

470
00:25:49,901 --> 00:25:51,400
I blame it all

471
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,836
on that bloody Vanessa
bloody Feltz show.

472
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:58,066
Should never have gone on it.

473
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:02,469
They never tell you
that's going to happen

474
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:06,100
when you go on.

475
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,702
You turn me down, and that
just leaves the door open

476
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,836
for him to come walking
back into your life,

477
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:13,000
don't it?

478
00:26:13,968 --> 00:26:15,567
Now look what you've done, eh?

479
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:26,802
You all right?

480
00:26:26,902 --> 00:26:28,801
Yeah.

481
00:26:28,901 --> 00:26:30,869
Do you want to watch The Weakest Link?</i>

482
00:26:30,969 --> 00:26:32,133
Yeah, go on, then.

483
00:26:36,067 --> 00:26:37,700
<i>According to many people,</i>

484
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,735
<i>the secret of successful entertaining</i>

485
00:26:39,835 --> 00:26:41,167
<i>is being in control.</i>

486
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,067
Do you reckon I could have him,
Charlie?

487
00:26:44,234 --> 00:26:46,335
It's not funny.

488
00:26:46,435 --> 00:26:48,434
Lads at work said

489
00:26:48,534 --> 00:26:50,268
he put someone in hospital
when he was 12.

490
00:26:50,368 --> 00:26:52,667
Is that true?

491
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:54,602
Look, it was just all schoolboy stuff,

492
00:26:54,702 --> 00:26:55,901
wasn't it?

493
00:26:58,601 --> 00:27:00,567
I'll go and find him, okay?

494
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:04,033
No, don't go, Charlie.

495
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:06,835
I'll cook you some tea, mate.

496
00:27:06,935 --> 00:27:09,602
It's crispy pancakes tonight.

497
00:27:09,702 --> 00:27:11,434
Charlie?

498
00:29:02,334 --> 00:29:04,400
Jimmy.

499
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:45,966
Shirl?

500
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:47,966
What are you doing?

501
00:29:48,066 --> 00:29:50,100
I'm going to get some lemonade.

502
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,966
There's some in the fridge.
I don't like it.

503
00:29:52,066 --> 00:29:54,135
There's nothing wrong with it.
I don't like that one.

504
00:29:54,235 --> 00:29:55,700
All right.

505
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,785
<i>Miami is, without a doubt,</i>
<i>the most stylish...</i>

506
00:29:58,885 --> 00:30:01,836
I'm going to go up to the garage
and give the car a wash.

507
00:30:01,936 --> 00:30:03,486
It's half price at night.

508
00:30:03,586 --> 00:30:05,066
All right, yeah, whatever.

509
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:06,836
<i>Jennifer Lopez,</i>
<i>Donatella Versace,</i>

510
00:30:06,936 --> 00:30:08,933
<i>and many more...</i>

511
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:11,235
Right, well,
I'm going to go now.

512
00:30:11,335 --> 00:30:13,602
Okay. See you later.

513
00:30:13,702 --> 00:30:14,902
I'm going.

514
00:30:15,002 --> 00:30:16,133
Dek...

515
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:17,700
Do you want a spin, Donut?

516
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,451
No, just pick us up a kebab, please.

517
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:23,168
I'm not going through town, Donut.

518
00:30:23,268 --> 00:30:24,400
You don't need to.

519
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,735
They sell them in the petrol
station, frozen ones.

520
00:30:26,835 --> 00:30:28,066
Oh, do they?

521
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:30,502
Can you get me a can of Red Bull
while you're there?

522
00:30:30,602 --> 00:30:32,802
Oh, yes.
Get the lads something as well.

523
00:30:32,902 --> 00:30:34,133
Oh, yes,
the lads, yes.

524
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:36,368
Dek, will you get us a Twix?
And a Twix.

525
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:38,369
Oh, and a spicy Pot Noodle.

526
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,300
Spicy Pot Noodle.
Okay.

527
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,500
Don't forget to warm up the kebab.

528
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,233
Oh, no, of course not.
I tell you what, Donut.

529
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:48,968
I'll swim to Turkey and get you
a nice fresh one, shall I?

530
00:30:49,068 --> 00:30:50,300
Just warm it up.

531
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,767
Can I just remind you all,

532
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:54,467
I've been downstairs on my own,

533
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:56,968
in my own house...
Dek, just go to the garage.

534
00:30:57,068 --> 00:30:58,033
all night.

535
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:23,501
Come on in and have a cup of tea.

536
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:26,685
Maybe just sit here for a bit, Charlie.

537
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:28,811
I don't know what you're worried about.

538
00:31:28,911 --> 00:31:30,902
There's only going to
be me and you there.

539
00:31:31,002 --> 00:31:32,200
Fucking hell.

540
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:40,502
Four chili wowsers,
four chili wowsers,

541
00:31:40,602 --> 00:31:42,436
a cheese lollipop...

542
00:31:42,536 --> 00:31:44,300
Jesus, man, you okay?

543
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,552
I've killed her.
I've killed my baby.

544
00:31:46,652 --> 00:31:49,128
Oh, you're all right,
you're okay.

545
00:31:49,228 --> 00:31:51,265
You're fine now.
Am I still here?

546
00:31:51,365 --> 00:31:53,333
Yeah, you're just in shock,
mate.

547
00:31:53,433 --> 00:31:55,602
Going a bit fast there, pal, you know.

548
00:31:55,702 --> 00:31:57,836
Sorry, mate. I don't
usually go that fast.

549
00:31:57,936 --> 00:31:59,353
Hey, are you all right?

550
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:00,836
Charlie, man.
Charlie.

551
00:32:00,936 --> 00:32:02,133
I've killed Baby.

552
00:32:02,233 --> 00:32:03,734
You know this guy,
Charlie?

553
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:06,300
Yeah, Jimmy, this is Dek.
Dek, this is Jimmy.

554
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:20,368
Jimmy, get your...

555
00:32:20,468 --> 00:32:22,133
Go and get your bag,

556
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:24,202
and you,
pull your bloody self together.

557
00:32:24,302 --> 00:32:25,500
Go home to Shirley, will you?

558
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,702
Hey, don't you be sick.
I'm the one who should be sick.

559
00:32:28,802 --> 00:32:31,035
Where am I going to get a door
to fit this?

560
00:32:31,135 --> 00:32:33,400
Houston, bloody Texas?

561
00:32:42,767 --> 00:32:43,801
Shirley...

562
00:32:45,534 --> 00:32:46,701
Shirley...

563
00:33:37,901 --> 00:33:39,300
See him taking the motor away.

564
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,367
Yeah, I know,
I've seen it from upstairs.

565
00:33:46,133 --> 00:33:48,735
What a way for you and Dek to meet, eh?

566
00:33:48,835 --> 00:33:50,968
Unbelievable, man.

567
00:34:03,267 --> 00:34:06,218
So, what are you back for, Jimmy?

568
00:34:06,318 --> 00:34:08,827
Should never have went away,
Charlie.

569
00:34:08,927 --> 00:34:11,402
Biggest mistake I made in my life.

570
00:34:11,502 --> 00:34:13,300
Don't be soft, lad.

571
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,734
You were never happy down here.

572
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:18,801
I was never happy anywhere else,
was I?

573
00:34:23,501 --> 00:34:25,267
I wanted Shirley to say no...

574
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:29,885
when that fanny asked her
to marry him on the telly.

575
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:32,335
Is there nobody who doesn't
watch that bloody show?

576
00:34:32,435 --> 00:34:37,968
Big chance for me, Charlie, man.

577
00:34:38,068 --> 00:34:41,000
Last chance.

578
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,752
I'm going to lose you next,
aren't I, Shirl?

579
00:34:43,852 --> 00:34:46,469
Oh, what are you saying
things like that for?

580
00:34:46,569 --> 00:34:48,769
It's true.
Why is it true?

581
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:50,567
Hmm?

582
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:53,200
Because Jimmy's back?

583
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,869
Says more about what you think
of me, Dek,

584
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,066
don't it?

585
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:00,567
Why do you think

586
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:02,902
I'm going to want to go back to him?

587
00:35:03,002 --> 00:35:05,135
He's like this...

588
00:35:05,235 --> 00:35:06,467
big mystery.

589
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:10,068
Like this Zorro figure
waiting in the shadows,

590
00:35:10,168 --> 00:35:11,834
just waiting to pounce on me.

591
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:14,001
He's like a virus and I can't breathe-

592
00:35:14,101 --> 00:35:16,769
Hey. Hey, stop it.
Stop it.

593
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:19,534
I don't care about Jimmy.

594
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:25,352
He left us, Dek.

595
00:35:25,452 --> 00:35:28,569
I'm with you now.

596
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:29,934
Okay?

597
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:34,300
Okay.

598
00:35:42,334 --> 00:35:44,802
Come upstairs with me.

599
00:35:44,902 --> 00:35:47,801
Yeah. Yeah.

600
00:35:47,901 --> 00:35:49,101
You want an M.O.T.?

601
00:35:49,201 --> 00:35:50,267
Mm-hmm.

602
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:51,468
Full service?

603
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:52,769
Oh, yeah.

604
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:54,067
Respray or...

605
00:35:58,601 --> 00:36:00,202
Who's that?

606
00:36:00,302 --> 00:36:01,868
Don't know.

607
00:36:08,968 --> 00:36:09,968
Shirley...

608
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:18,335
Oh, my God.

609
00:36:18,435 --> 00:36:20,103
Oh. Oh, my God.

610
00:36:20,203 --> 00:36:21,801
Oh, my God,

611
00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:24,200
it's a pink plastic pig.

612
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,902
Your legs will never fit in there.

613
00:36:27,002 --> 00:36:28,133
I can't.

614
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:30,469
I'm going to have to...
I can't go out in that.

615
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:31,869
I'm going to lose business.

616
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:34,302
Babe, I can't.

617
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:35,601
You can.

618
00:36:37,901 --> 00:36:40,434
* Tomorrow *

619
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:45,502
* Tomorrow *

620
00:36:45,602 --> 00:36:48,167
* They say *

621
00:36:48,267 --> 00:36:50,167
Know what you're doing?
Yeah.

622
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:52,167
North Wales Champion
four times running.

623
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:58,335
* And even though today *

624
00:36:58,435 --> 00:37:01,452
* We will be parted *

625
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,500
* My love for you *

626
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,300
Hey, no,
that's the upper body.

627
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,133
No, it's not.
You can't use the upper body.

628
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:10,869
It's got to be in the arm.
Well, do what I'm doing, then.

629
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:12,936
This is what you're doing.
This is what he's doing.

630
00:37:13,036 --> 00:37:14,167
No, he's not.

631
00:37:14,267 --> 00:37:15,936
You're just being mardy
because you're losing.

632
00:37:16,036 --> 00:37:17,367
Ah! Cancel it.
Cancel it.

633
00:37:17,467 --> 00:37:19,502
It's gone. Cancel the game,
that doesn't count.

634
00:37:19,602 --> 00:37:20,734
You've pulled it, man.

635
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:22,435
You severed something from the bone.

636
00:37:22,535 --> 00:37:23,700
He's only 17.

637
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,602
He hasn't been in a serious
car accident, has he, Donna?

638
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,235
Neither have you.
It was only a bump.

639
00:37:28,335 --> 00:37:30,352
It was a near-death experience.

640
00:37:30,452 --> 00:37:32,435
I had a car door this far...

641
00:37:32,535 --> 00:37:33,968
this far from my eye.

642
00:37:34,068 --> 00:37:36,033
My eye, Donna.

643
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,767
If it wasn't for my...

644
00:37:41,867 --> 00:37:44,268
my guardian angel over there,

645
00:37:44,368 --> 00:37:46,735
I wouldn't have pulled through.

646
00:37:46,835 --> 00:37:48,902
She's pissed,
isn't she?

647
00:37:49,002 --> 00:37:50,500
She is pissed.

648
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,936
We're in a new phase now
in the relationship,

649
00:37:53,036 --> 00:37:55,053
and I don't mind her being pissed.

650
00:37:55,153 --> 00:37:57,135
It's just another quality, isn't it?

651
00:37:57,235 --> 00:38:00,200
Of her, of Shirley.

652
00:38:01,968 --> 00:38:04,133
Thank you kindly,
folks.

653
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:07,469
That was a request for Jeannie
there behind the bar.

654
00:38:07,569 --> 00:38:08,634
Shirley, my arm.

655
00:38:08,734 --> 00:38:10,235
Shirley, careful, darling,
please.

656
00:38:10,335 --> 00:38:11,667
Shirley, stop it.

657
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:13,101
Come and have a dance,
Dek, together.

658
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:14,635
Shirley, don't.
Oh, come on.

659
00:38:14,735 --> 00:38:15,767
Shirley...

660
00:38:15,867 --> 00:38:17,302
Come up there and service me.

661
00:38:17,402 --> 00:38:19,003
Okay, Shirley.

662
00:38:19,103 --> 00:38:20,634
My arm, my arm!

663
00:38:20,734 --> 00:38:25,467
* If you knew just how blue *

664
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:28,318
* That I get When I'm not with you *

665
00:38:28,418 --> 00:38:31,135
* Oh, you'd cry A million tears *

666
00:38:31,235 --> 00:38:34,734
* You'd cry *

667
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:38,568
* And if you start To break my heart *

668
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:42,368
* When you see That I'm falling apart *

669
00:38:42,468 --> 00:38:45,836
* Oh, you'd cry A million tears *

670
00:38:45,936 --> 00:38:47,934
* You'd cry *

671
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:53,118
* And if the raindrops Make a river *

672
00:38:53,218 --> 00:38:56,400
* Then your tears Would make a sea *

673
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,402
* But your tears
Would count for nothing *

674
00:39:00,502 --> 00:39:02,135
Bloody hell.

675
00:39:02,235 --> 00:39:03,567
Hello.

676
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:05,836
My favorite sister.
How are you doing, darling?

677
00:39:05,936 --> 00:39:07,066
I'm all right.

678
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:08,534
They said you were back.

679
00:39:08,634 --> 00:39:10,569
Am I not top of your list
no more or something?

680
00:39:10,669 --> 00:39:12,569
Fucking hell. Glad you're
pleased to see me.

681
00:39:12,669 --> 00:39:14,019
Well, I thought you were dead.

682
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:15,400
Made a comeback,
didn't I?

683
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,966
Oh, are you all right, my duck?

684
00:39:17,066 --> 00:39:19,268
I'm all right, duck.
Well, all right, duck.

685
00:39:19,368 --> 00:39:21,267
God, you won the lottery or something?

686
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:23,402
Just about, baby.
Get yourself a new shell suit.

687
00:39:23,502 --> 00:39:25,001
Oh, no, no,
I'm not having that.

688
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:28,233
No, go on.
Ah, go on, then.

689
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:31,035
I'm thirsty.
I'm getting something to drink.

690
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,667
Oi, oi, get us a drink.
Get me a lager.

691
00:40:06,501 --> 00:40:09,235
Shirley.

692
00:40:09,335 --> 00:40:12,033
Shirley!

693
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,167
Dek, I want to go home.

694
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:27,035
What, because of that wazzock?

695
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:29,367
No bloody way, babes.

696
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,902
Why can't you just leave us alone, eh?

697
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:39,934
Huh?

698
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:44,936
Just take your new
gay haircut and flip off.

699
00:40:45,036 --> 00:40:46,335
Oh, you can talk,
peanut head.

700
00:40:46,435 --> 00:40:48,619
It's all right, Carol.

701
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:50,869
I was leaving anyway.

702
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:52,834
Go on, then.

703
00:40:52,934 --> 00:40:54,467
Well,
you know where the door is.

704
00:40:54,567 --> 00:40:57,702
Oh, Jim, don't go
just because of that prat.

705
00:40:57,802 --> 00:41:00,934
Come on, mate. Out you go.
Right, come on.

706
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:05,018
Taxi for Wilson.

707
00:41:05,118 --> 00:41:06,867
Get out of my way.

708
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,702
Mum, do you want me to come with you?

709
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:11,836
No, you're all right, babe.

710
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,634
All right?

711
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:16,001
<i>Sorry about that little disturbance,</i>

712
00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:17,367
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

713
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:19,869
<i>Apparently someone's been</i>
<i>given the correct change</i>

714
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:21,135
<i>by one of the barmaids.</i>

715
00:41:21,235 --> 00:41:22,300
What?

716
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,333
<i>That'd be a bloody first,</i>
<i>wouldn't it?</i>

717
00:41:24,433 --> 00:41:26,669
<i>Okay, by the way, you've</i>
<i>probably heard around the club,</i>

718
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:27,801
Stop it.

719
00:41:27,901 --> 00:41:30,035
<i>I've been forced to have a vasectomy.</i>

720
00:41:30,135 --> 00:41:32,802
<i>I didn't want to do it,</i>
<i>but the wife did.</i>

721
00:41:32,902 --> 00:41:35,535
<i>Anyway, we asked the kids to vote on it</i>

722
00:41:35,635 --> 00:41:37,968
<i>and I lost 13-12.</i>

723
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:04,801
Dek, are you all right?

724
00:42:04,901 --> 00:42:07,268
You seem dead weird.
No, I've just got wind.

725
00:42:07,368 --> 00:42:10,101
Not bothered about last night, are you?

726
00:42:10,201 --> 00:42:12,200
No. I'm fine.

727
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,035
Fine, then. I'll go.

728
00:42:14,135 --> 00:42:15,567
Okay.

729
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:19,300
Enjoy yourself.
Yeah, see you later.

730
00:42:22,501 --> 00:42:24,000
Come on, Dek.

731
00:42:25,133 --> 00:42:26,985
Marlene!

732
00:42:27,085 --> 00:42:28,901
What?

733
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:37,267
Morning.

734
00:42:37,367 --> 00:42:39,033
Hello.
Hello.

735
00:42:39,133 --> 00:42:40,467
What do you want, Dek?

736
00:42:47,801 --> 00:42:49,400
Marlene...

737
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,235
I know it's your birthday next week,

738
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:56,100
but this is an early present

739
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,151
and I'd like you to open it now.

740
00:42:58,251 --> 00:43:00,377
My granddad gave it to my father,

741
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:02,569
and my father gave it to me, and...

742
00:43:02,669 --> 00:43:05,100
Dek, it's a man's watch.

743
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,585
Yes, it is a man's watch, Marlene.

744
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:10,000
The Queen gives her crown to her sons

745
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,702
and it passes on down the family
like that.

746
00:43:12,802 --> 00:43:14,753
It's...
It's a heirloom.

747
00:43:14,853 --> 00:43:16,769
A heirloom, they call them,

748
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:18,233
and, um...

749
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:20,552
I'd love you to have it.

750
00:43:20,652 --> 00:43:22,811
You do like it,
don't you?

751
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:25,035
Yeah, I love it.
It's...

752
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:26,435
silver and stuff.

753
00:43:26,535 --> 00:43:27,834
Yeah.

754
00:43:29,167 --> 00:43:31,335
It's like the crown jewels.
I'd best be going to school.

755
00:43:31,435 --> 00:43:33,335
Oh, all right then. Bye.

756
00:43:33,435 --> 00:43:35,001
Tell the time.

757
00:43:35,101 --> 00:43:35,934
I will.

758
00:43:59,901 --> 00:44:01,200
Hey, baby.

759
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,801
What are you doing here?

760
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:09,067
Look, I don't want to cause you
any trouble, Shirley.

761
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:13,769
I know Marlene's birthday's coming up

762
00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:15,233
and I didn't want to miss it.

763
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:17,834
Well, I am going to miss it-
I'm going back up the road-

764
00:44:17,934 --> 00:44:21,400
but I just wanted to make sure
she got her presents, you know.

765
00:44:24,067 --> 00:44:25,569
Are you going back to Glasgow?

766
00:44:25,669 --> 00:44:28,066
Aye.

767
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:30,567
All right.

768
00:44:33,868 --> 00:44:36,268
Mad the other night, eh?

769
00:44:36,368 --> 00:44:39,000
Hmm?

770
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:42,235
Yeah, I was a bit drunk.

771
00:44:42,335 --> 00:44:45,100
I felt something.

772
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,367
I thought I felt a wee...

773
00:44:48,467 --> 00:44:50,035
thought I felt a wee something,

774
00:44:50,135 --> 00:44:51,600
you know?

775
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,368
Thought you felt something.

776
00:44:53,468 --> 00:44:56,901
A wee something.

777
00:44:57,001 --> 00:44:59,335
You must think I'm really stupid.

778
00:44:59,435 --> 00:45:00,267
No.

779
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,402
I'm with Dek now.

780
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:07,133
He's great,

781
00:45:07,233 --> 00:45:08,400
and Marlene is great.

782
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,667
You know, it's really great.

783
00:45:12,434 --> 00:45:14,100
I saw you turn him down on the telly.

784
00:45:16,868 --> 00:45:21,300
I'll make sure
Marlene gets these presents.

785
00:45:40,367 --> 00:45:41,801
Between you and me, I uh...

786
00:45:41,901 --> 00:45:45,836
think he was knocking her about
when they lived together.

787
00:45:45,936 --> 00:45:46,901
No.

788
00:45:47,001 --> 00:45:49,333
Oh, aye, yeah.

789
00:45:49,433 --> 00:45:51,035
Well, you can tell, can't you?

790
00:45:51,135 --> 00:45:52,966
You know, terrible.

791
00:45:53,066 --> 00:45:54,769
So what was the crack then, Boss?

792
00:45:54,869 --> 00:45:56,519
What kicked it off?

793
00:45:56,619 --> 00:45:58,235
Oh, well, I went white.

794
00:45:58,335 --> 00:45:59,867
White.

795
00:45:59,967 --> 00:46:01,135
You did not go white.

796
00:46:01,235 --> 00:46:02,834
Donut,

797
00:46:02,934 --> 00:46:04,302
I know what color I was,

798
00:46:04,402 --> 00:46:05,667
and it was white.

799
00:46:05,767 --> 00:46:07,267
How do you know what color I was?

800
00:46:07,367 --> 00:46:09,368
You were down the hall,
dancing like a little girl.

801
00:46:09,468 --> 00:46:10,968
So come on,
then, Darkus.

802
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,133
What happened, man?

803
00:46:12,233 --> 00:46:13,534
Yeah, what did you do, boss?

804
00:46:13,634 --> 00:46:15,133
I didn't have to touch him,
did I?

805
00:46:15,233 --> 00:46:16,867
When you're like that,
when you've got that...

806
00:46:16,967 --> 00:46:19,302
I just walked across the hall.
There he was by the bar.

807
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:21,068
Stood.
He's only down there.

808
00:46:21,168 --> 00:46:22,067
He's only that big.

809
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:25,652
Yeah, tiny little thing.

810
00:46:25,752 --> 00:46:27,261
And you didn't hit him?

811
00:46:27,361 --> 00:46:30,267
Didn't have to hit him.

812
00:46:30,367 --> 00:46:32,302
It's all in the silence of the...

813
00:46:32,402 --> 00:46:33,567
of the...

814
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:34,867
Zen, isn't it?

815
00:46:34,967 --> 00:46:36,352
Come on, he used to be solid.

816
00:46:36,452 --> 00:46:37,767
You're telling us he walked?

817
00:46:37,867 --> 00:46:39,802
Well, he might have been solid
when you knew him,

818
00:46:39,902 --> 00:46:40,933
but he ain't solid now.

819
00:46:41,033 --> 00:46:43,368
He wasn't solid when
he was faced with me,

820
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:45,734
with that whiteness.
I'd have given him

821
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:47,769
another five, six seconds,
and it would have, you know...

822
00:46:47,869 --> 00:46:50,302
The whiteness would have
gone to another color.

823
00:46:50,402 --> 00:46:52,186
You know, I'd have gone...

824
00:46:52,286 --> 00:46:54,035
Ha! You know,
and pah, pah!

825
00:46:54,135 --> 00:46:55,033
Boof!

826
00:46:55,133 --> 00:46:56,836
You should've done.

827
00:46:56,936 --> 00:46:58,867
Isn't it?

828
00:46:58,967 --> 00:47:01,135
I mean, I could've done,
couldn't I?

829
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,400
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

830
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:05,918
Oi, Jimmy.

831
00:47:06,018 --> 00:47:07,100
Hey, Jimmy.

832
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,469
What are you doing back in town,
Jimmy?

833
00:47:10,569 --> 00:47:13,101
Welcome to hell, Jimmy.

834
00:47:13,201 --> 00:47:14,367
Welcome to hell.

835
00:47:14,467 --> 00:47:15,769
You're messing with my family,

836
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:17,033
Jimmy.

837
00:47:17,133 --> 00:47:18,600
Dek, you got customers, mate.

838
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:21,068
You stay away from my family,
Jimmy, huh?

839
00:47:21,168 --> 00:47:22,200
Dek.

840
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,802
Dek, you've got customers.

841
00:47:23,902 --> 00:47:25,334
You got a customer.

842
00:47:37,167 --> 00:47:39,000
Sorry to interrupt,
boys.

843
00:47:41,367 --> 00:47:43,485
Can we have a word?

844
00:47:43,585 --> 00:47:45,635
I'm all ears, Jimmy.

845
00:47:45,735 --> 00:47:47,033
No,

846
00:47:47,133 --> 00:47:49,218
in private, man.

847
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:51,333
A private word?

848
00:47:51,433 --> 00:47:53,968
Do you want me to come back?
No, no.

849
00:47:54,068 --> 00:47:56,267
You stay there.

850
00:47:56,367 --> 00:47:59,834
I'll have a word in private with you.

851
00:48:05,267 --> 00:48:08,567
Would you like to come through
to the office?

852
00:48:19,767 --> 00:48:21,233
Think we should...

853
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,535
Do you think we should go
and help him out?

854
00:48:23,635 --> 00:48:25,367
Tea break, mate,
isn't it?

855
00:48:25,467 --> 00:48:28,035
Yeah, it's not really
the time for it, is it, really?

856
00:48:28,135 --> 00:48:30,235
Go on, then.

857
00:48:30,335 --> 00:48:31,886
Say it.

858
00:48:31,986 --> 00:48:33,461
Say what?

859
00:48:33,561 --> 00:48:34,966
Sorry.

860
00:48:35,066 --> 00:48:37,802
What do I need to say sorry to you for,

861
00:48:37,902 --> 00:48:39,300
you fucking fanny?

862
00:48:41,567 --> 00:48:43,333
Well, maybe...

863
00:48:43,433 --> 00:48:45,035
Maybe you shouldn't apologize to me,

864
00:48:45,135 --> 00:48:46,519
but you should apologize to Shirley.

865
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:48,678
She's frightened to death of you.

866
00:48:48,778 --> 00:48:50,767
You've really scared her, Jimmy.

867
00:48:50,867 --> 00:48:52,602
Now, I don't know
what happened in the past

868
00:48:52,702 --> 00:48:53,901
between you and her,
but I...

869
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:56,067
I think you used to knock her about.

870
00:49:05,968 --> 00:49:09,300
It's going to get really nasty
in here in a minute.

871
00:49:11,834 --> 00:49:14,602
Look at the state of you.

872
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:17,434
You're not even half a man.

873
00:49:20,234 --> 00:49:22,802
You think I'm going to let you
take my Shirley away from me?

874
00:49:22,902 --> 00:49:24,367
Are you fucking joking?

875
00:49:27,934 --> 00:49:30,066
No.

876
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:32,769
I'm going to take you
right out of the picture,

877
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:34,501
and it'll be before you know it.

878
00:49:37,467 --> 00:49:38,934
All right, Tex?

879
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,235
Hello.

880
00:50:37,335 --> 00:50:38,952
Scotland?

881
00:50:39,052 --> 00:50:40,600
Scotland!

882
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,368
Oh, sweet mother of God.

883
00:50:42,468 --> 00:50:44,136
It's happening.

884
00:50:44,236 --> 00:50:45,869
They're here.

885
00:50:45,969 --> 00:50:47,000
Oh...

886
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,235
Where's my suitcase?

887
00:50:50,335 --> 00:50:51,534
What?

888
00:50:52,834 --> 00:50:55,068
Dek, what are you doing?

889
00:50:55,168 --> 00:50:57,335
Just take the kid and go!

890
00:50:57,435 --> 00:50:59,667
Dek...

891
00:50:59,767 --> 00:51:02,033
what on earth are you doing?

892
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,933
Dek, what are you doing?

893
00:51:13,033 --> 00:51:15,302
Go to your room, get under
the bed, and stay there.

894
00:51:15,402 --> 00:51:16,436
Is this a joke or something?

895
00:51:16,536 --> 00:51:17,535
No, it's serious,
Marlene.

896
00:51:17,635 --> 00:51:18,667
Go, go, go, go, go!

897
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,966
Hiya.

898
00:51:23,066 --> 00:51:25,100
Me and my pals,

899
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,135
we're down here
looking for a mate of ours.

900
00:51:28,235 --> 00:51:29,467
He lives...

901
00:51:29,567 --> 00:51:30,968
In fact, I think he lives here.

902
00:51:31,068 --> 00:51:32,068
His name's Jimmy.

903
00:51:32,168 --> 00:51:33,119
Jimmy?

904
00:51:33,219 --> 00:51:34,100
Jimmy.

905
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,168
Aye, we're friends of Jimmy.

906
00:51:35,268 --> 00:51:36,233
Sorry?

907
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:38,285
He said we're great pals of Jimmy.

908
00:51:38,385 --> 00:51:40,302
Well, I know it sounds a wee bit weird

909
00:51:40,402 --> 00:51:41,734
but we heard he was here-

910
00:51:41,834 --> 00:51:43,502
I've not seen him.
Not for three years.

911
00:51:43,602 --> 00:51:44,767
Now, if you don't mind,

912
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:46,669
I've got to go and see to my daughter.

913
00:51:46,769 --> 00:51:48,033
Well, maybe if he's passing,

914
00:51:48,133 --> 00:51:49,901
you could give us a wee bell, eh?

915
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:54,734
No, get out!

916
00:51:54,834 --> 00:51:57,567
Jimmy, you wee bastard, you!

917
00:51:57,667 --> 00:51:59,685
My daughter's there,
you bastards!

918
00:51:59,785 --> 00:52:02,044
Have you seen somebody called Jimmy?

919
00:52:02,144 --> 00:52:04,368
Come on, Marlene.
Come on. Downstairs.

920
00:52:04,468 --> 00:52:06,402
Jimmy!
You wee bastard, you!

921
00:52:06,502 --> 00:52:07,567
Jimmy!

922
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:08,767
He's in here!

923
00:52:11,934 --> 00:52:13,352
Jimmy...

924
00:52:13,452 --> 00:52:14,767
Out. Now.

925
00:52:14,867 --> 00:52:16,302
I'll count to three.

926
00:52:16,402 --> 00:52:17,269
One, two...

927
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:18,234
Okay, okay.

928
00:52:20,934 --> 00:52:22,902
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

929
00:52:23,002 --> 00:52:24,033
Who are you?

930
00:52:24,133 --> 00:52:27,167
Derek Slater, 98 Second Avenue.

931
00:52:27,267 --> 00:52:29,035
And what the fuck have you come as,

932
00:52:29,135 --> 00:52:30,334
you big streak of piss?

933
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,569
I'm looking for Jimmy.

934
00:52:37,669 --> 00:52:39,066
Jimmy?

935
00:52:39,166 --> 00:52:40,551
You seen him?

936
00:52:40,651 --> 00:52:41,966
Not here, no.

937
00:52:42,066 --> 00:52:43,135
So you have seen him?

938
00:52:43,235 --> 00:52:44,936
Not...

939
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,667
Not here.

940
00:52:46,767 --> 00:52:48,202
Now, don't fuck me around.

941
00:52:48,302 --> 00:52:49,734
Sorry.

942
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:51,936
I've seen him in town.

943
00:52:52,036 --> 00:52:53,569
Where?

944
00:52:53,669 --> 00:52:55,133
By...

945
00:52:55,233 --> 00:52:56,300
By a river.

946
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,702
Are you taking the piss out of me?

947
00:52:58,802 --> 00:53:00,200
No. I'm a civilian.

948
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,018
Look, just leave your number

949
00:53:03,118 --> 00:53:05,767
and I'll get right back to you

950
00:53:05,867 --> 00:53:08,002
as soon as I hear him
or see anything of him.

951
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:10,234
I promise, I promise,
I promise, I promise.

952
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,767
You'd better be straight with me, pal.

953
00:53:21,467 --> 00:53:23,501
Please don't do anything sexual.

954
00:53:26,567 --> 00:53:28,234
Come on.

955
00:53:36,601 --> 00:53:38,167
Hey, Billy.
What?

956
00:53:38,267 --> 00:53:40,335
Can we go see The Tales of Robin Hood?</i>

957
00:53:40,435 --> 00:53:41,634
Can you fuck...

958
00:53:41,734 --> 00:53:43,267
Fuck that.
I'm starving.

959
00:53:43,367 --> 00:53:44,968
I know. They've got
medieval banquets up there.

960
00:53:45,068 --> 00:53:46,100
Who stole this fucking van?

961
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,802
Ripping legs off of chickens and stuff.

962
00:53:47,902 --> 00:53:48,968
It's absolutely brilliant.

963
00:53:49,068 --> 00:53:50,300
I tell you, Jumbo...

964
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,167
I said, who stole this fucking van?

965
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:00,167
Here you are.
Have this cushion.

966
00:54:00,267 --> 00:54:01,802
No, no, I don't need
another cushion, darling.

967
00:54:01,902 --> 00:54:02,933
You'll be all right.

968
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:04,835
I don't need another.
You'll be all right.

969
00:54:04,935 --> 00:54:06,667
Take it away.
No, look, it's in my throat now.

970
00:54:06,767 --> 00:54:08,902
I can't breathe. Listen.
I can't breathe. Take it away.

971
00:54:09,002 --> 00:54:10,802
Put it there, then.
Put it there.

972
00:54:10,902 --> 00:54:11,933
That's it.

973
00:54:12,033 --> 00:54:13,936
Leave it there. That's it.

974
00:54:14,036 --> 00:54:16,019
Thank you.

975
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,033
Oh, that's...

976
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:20,101
That's quite nice.

977
00:54:20,201 --> 00:54:21,100
Here you go.

978
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,968
Thank you, darling.

979
00:54:23,068 --> 00:54:23,966
Right.

980
00:54:24,066 --> 00:54:25,101
Got everything you need now?

981
00:54:25,201 --> 00:54:26,667
Yeah. Yeah.

982
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:29,235
Do you mind if I go out
for a little bit?

983
00:54:29,335 --> 00:54:30,569
Where are you going?

984
00:54:30,669 --> 00:54:32,001
I don't know.

985
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:33,000
Just...

986
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,434
get some fresh air and stuff.

987
00:54:34,534 --> 00:54:37,702
You know,
it's been dead weird today.

988
00:54:37,802 --> 00:54:40,000
Hmm.

989
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,469
Do you want me to come with you?
No, it's all right.

990
00:54:42,569 --> 00:54:44,886
I'd quite like to be on my own.

991
00:54:44,986 --> 00:54:47,268
How long are you going to be?

992
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:48,569
I don't know.

993
00:54:48,669 --> 00:54:49,969
Just...

994
00:54:50,069 --> 00:54:51,300
not long.

995
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,502
Are you all right?

996
00:54:52,602 --> 00:54:54,133
Mm-hmm.

997
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,234
Okay.

998
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:01,634
I love you, Shirl.

999
00:55:25,968 --> 00:55:28,335
Oh, my God.

1000
00:55:28,435 --> 00:55:29,600
What?

1001
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,100
Dek, Baby's back.

1002
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:38,500
Whoo!

1003
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,751
* I smell something In the air *

1004
00:55:41,851 --> 00:55:44,968
* It smells like barbecue... *

1005
00:55:45,068 --> 00:55:47,400
Whoo!
That one. Do that.

1006
00:55:48,534 --> 00:55:50,200
* That barbecue... *

1007
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,968
Go on, do it again.
All right.

1008
00:55:52,068 --> 00:55:54,269
* I smell barbecue... *

1009
00:55:54,369 --> 00:55:56,567
* You smell barbecue... **

1010
00:56:06,067 --> 00:56:07,901
Shirley...

1011
00:56:13,033 --> 00:56:15,035
talk to me, baby.

1012
00:56:15,135 --> 00:56:17,067
Shut up.

1013
00:56:22,167 --> 00:56:25,167
What are you here for really?

1014
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,600
I told you.

1015
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,936
I tried to tell you.

1016
00:56:32,036 --> 00:56:34,300
Why now?

1017
00:56:38,567 --> 00:56:40,934
Because I never really
ever wanted to go away.

1018
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,635
I was too young.

1019
00:56:46,735 --> 00:56:49,334
I felt too young.

1020
00:56:51,334 --> 00:56:52,867
If I'd have stayed with you,

1021
00:56:52,967 --> 00:56:55,268
we'd have ended up
splitting up anyway, baby.

1022
00:56:55,368 --> 00:56:57,968
You didn't stay to find out,
did you?

1023
00:57:01,868 --> 00:57:04,133
No.

1024
00:57:12,234 --> 00:57:15,233
That's why I'm here, babe.

1025
00:57:15,333 --> 00:57:18,700
I think that you and me
should be together.

1026
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,902
I absolutely think that
you and me should be together

1027
00:57:21,002 --> 00:57:22,601
and I want it back.

1028
00:57:26,033 --> 00:57:27,334
I want it back.

1029
00:57:30,834 --> 00:57:33,569
Hang on, we're spinning,
we're spinning!

1030
00:57:33,669 --> 00:57:36,268
Hang on, hang on,
I'm on the grass.

1031
00:57:36,368 --> 00:57:37,969
Come on.

1032
00:57:38,069 --> 00:57:39,667
Hang on.

1033
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:46,400
Shirley...

1034
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,000
I've not got any right

1035
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,835
to ask you for anything, darling,

1036
00:57:49,935 --> 00:57:51,600
but if you feel anything at all,

1037
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,668
if there's anything
left at all, then tell me

1038
00:57:53,768 --> 00:57:55,702
and I'll fucking
hang about here, you know?

1039
00:57:55,802 --> 00:57:57,267
I'll hang about here forever.

1040
00:57:59,167 --> 00:58:01,235
I think you know
the answer to that one,

1041
00:58:01,335 --> 00:58:03,467
don't you?

1042
00:58:05,968 --> 00:58:07,702
Oh, God, I'm confused.

1043
00:58:07,802 --> 00:58:10,367
I know.

1044
00:58:12,801 --> 00:58:15,868
Oh, Jimmy.

1045
00:58:15,968 --> 00:58:18,236
I missed you.

1046
00:58:18,336 --> 00:58:20,534
I'm sorry.

1047
00:58:20,634 --> 00:58:24,135
* Baby's the best car On the road *

1048
00:58:24,235 --> 00:58:27,469
* She's the best car On the road *

1049
00:58:27,569 --> 00:58:30,801
* She killed an old lady And a toad **

1050
00:58:45,367 --> 00:58:47,534
Can you all get out, please?

1051
00:58:47,634 --> 00:58:50,001
Come on, Dek, mate,
let's just go.

1052
00:58:50,101 --> 00:58:51,567
Please.

1053
00:58:51,667 --> 00:58:54,300
Please, just get out.

1054
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:00,000
Come on, you two.

1055
00:59:06,901 --> 00:59:09,518
I don't have to go, do I?

1056
00:59:09,618 --> 00:59:12,133
I need to be alone,
Marlene.

1057
00:59:12,233 --> 00:59:14,100
Yeah, but are you
going to be all right?

1058
00:59:17,701 --> 00:59:18,868
Please, Marlene.

1059
00:59:18,968 --> 00:59:20,033
Please, darling.

1060
00:59:20,133 --> 00:59:22,001
Dek, look at you.
You're in a right state.

1061
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:23,000
Please.

1062
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,133
See you later, then.

1063
01:00:31,834 --> 01:00:33,534
Hello, it's me.

1064
01:00:33,634 --> 01:00:38,101
The bloke who fell
out of the airing cupboard.

1065
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:42,552
Listen, I know where he is.

1066
01:00:42,652 --> 01:00:46,933
I know where he's stopping.

1067
01:00:47,033 --> 01:00:49,769
No, don't you dare
come around to my house.

1068
01:00:49,869 --> 01:00:52,135
I don't want this linking back to me.

1069
01:00:52,235 --> 01:00:55,469
Can't I just tell you?

1070
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:58,734
It's really easy to find.

1071
01:00:58,834 --> 01:01:03,469
No, you stop playing games
with me, mister.

1072
01:01:03,569 --> 01:01:05,534
Sorry, sorry.

1073
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,801
Well, I don't...

1074
01:01:12,334 --> 01:01:13,569
Okay, okay.

1075
01:01:13,669 --> 01:01:14,801
Flipping heck.

1076
01:01:14,901 --> 01:01:16,367
I'll meet you at dawn,

1077
01:01:16,467 --> 01:01:19,801
but I'm choosing the rendezvous.

1078
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:27,834
All right, all right.

1079
01:02:27,934 --> 01:02:29,700
I heard you the hundredth time.

1080
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:33,335
Jimmy, answer the bloody door,
would you, lad?

1081
01:02:33,435 --> 01:02:35,567
Jimmy?

1082
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:38,234
All right. Who do you think
I am, Linford Christie?

1083
01:02:40,067 --> 01:02:42,167
Milk?

1084
01:02:42,267 --> 01:02:44,035
I get mine from the shop, thanks.

1085
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:45,569
What about a yogurt?

1086
01:02:45,669 --> 01:02:47,700
Or spuds?

1087
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:48,968
Is that you, Dek?

1088
01:02:49,068 --> 01:02:49,868
No.

1089
01:02:53,367 --> 01:02:54,534
Fucking cracker,
Billy.

1090
01:02:54,634 --> 01:02:56,702
Where's Jimmy? I know
he's been staying here.

1091
01:02:56,802 --> 01:02:57,968
I don't know what you're talking about.

1092
01:02:58,068 --> 01:02:59,702
I don't know...
Want some more?

1093
01:02:59,802 --> 01:03:01,402
what you're talking about.
Okay.

1094
01:03:01,502 --> 01:03:03,868
Fuck!
Fucking hell!

1095
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:08,902
Take him out, Billy.

1096
01:03:09,002 --> 01:03:11,267
Take him out.

1097
01:03:11,367 --> 01:03:13,000
This has nothing to do with me!

1098
01:03:20,968 --> 01:03:22,767
It's nothing to do with me,
is it?

1099
01:03:34,601 --> 01:03:36,567
Get behind him.
Get behind him.

1100
01:03:42,267 --> 01:03:45,067
My foot! My foot!

1101
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:51,000
Take a look upstairs.

1102
01:04:29,234 --> 01:04:30,902
Here you are, babe.

1103
01:04:31,002 --> 01:04:32,286
Oh, ta, love.

1104
01:04:32,386 --> 01:04:33,600
Do you know what?

1105
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:36,469
My bloody foot's throbbing now.

1106
01:04:36,569 --> 01:04:37,703
Aw. You all right?

1107
01:04:37,803 --> 01:04:38,934
Yeah, not bad.

1108
01:04:41,334 --> 01:04:42,267
Bloody hell.

1109
01:04:42,367 --> 01:04:45,000
What a fucking mess.

1110
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,268
So, where were you,
then, Jim?

1111
01:04:46,368 --> 01:04:48,500
What?

1112
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,367
When all this was kicking off.
Where were you?

1113
01:04:52,901 --> 01:04:55,001
Oh, he'd just nipped out, love.

1114
01:04:55,101 --> 01:04:56,467
Nipped out?

1115
01:04:56,567 --> 01:04:58,101
What, half past 5:00 in the morning?

1116
01:04:58,201 --> 01:04:59,702
Where did he nip out to?

1117
01:04:59,802 --> 01:05:01,268
Tell her about Dek, Charlie.

1118
01:05:01,368 --> 01:05:02,434
Huh?

1119
01:05:02,534 --> 01:05:04,702
Oh, just forget about all that.

1120
01:05:04,802 --> 01:05:05,936
Tell her about Dek.

1121
01:05:06,036 --> 01:05:07,067
Tell me what?

1122
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:11,066
Fucking Dek grassed us up, all right?

1123
01:05:11,166 --> 01:05:13,335
He saw him standing outside
when they arrived.

1124
01:05:13,435 --> 01:05:15,634
Oh, Dek grassed you up, did he?

1125
01:05:15,734 --> 01:05:17,233
I don't know whether he grassed him up

1126
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:19,569
or Dek was with them
when they came to the door.

1127
01:05:19,669 --> 01:05:21,233
I'll deal with that streak of piss

1128
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:22,868
when the time comes,
but, the point is,

1129
01:05:22,968 --> 01:05:24,485
they were looking
for you, weren't they?

1130
01:05:24,585 --> 01:05:26,068
What the fuck are you getting at here?

1131
01:05:26,168 --> 01:05:27,434
Aye, they were looking for me.

1132
01:05:27,534 --> 01:05:29,569
I didn't smash the house up,
Carol, okay?

1133
01:05:29,669 --> 01:05:30,867
Dek fucking grassed us up.

1134
01:05:30,967 --> 01:05:33,001
It's his fault the place
is smashed up, not mine.

1135
01:05:33,101 --> 01:05:35,269
Well, of course it's your fault.

1136
01:05:35,369 --> 01:05:37,502
See? See, it's always the same.

1137
01:05:37,602 --> 01:05:38,933
Every time you come back,

1138
01:05:39,033 --> 01:05:40,635
you bring trouble with you, don't you?

1139
01:05:40,735 --> 01:05:42,267
Every bloody time.

1140
01:05:42,367 --> 01:05:44,135
Look at you.
He don't care.

1141
01:05:44,235 --> 01:05:45,933
You're like a little...

1142
01:05:46,033 --> 01:05:47,968
What's that word?
He's immature, isn't he?

1143
01:05:48,068 --> 01:05:50,033
Like a little kid.

1144
01:05:50,133 --> 01:05:51,968
Well, I've had enough, Jim,
all right?

1145
01:05:52,068 --> 01:05:53,635
I've really had enough now.

1146
01:05:53,735 --> 01:05:55,100
Coming around here,

1147
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,001
always causing trouble
on my bloody doorstep.

1148
01:05:57,101 --> 01:05:58,669
A few fucking tapes, man.

1149
01:05:58,769 --> 01:06:00,066
A few tapes?

1150
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:01,534
There's some originals there.

1151
01:06:01,634 --> 01:06:03,535
He saved up for 10 years for all that.

1152
01:06:03,635 --> 01:06:04,700
A lot of shite.

1153
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,335
Bloody sent to Nashville
for some of them.

1154
01:06:06,435 --> 01:06:07,500
Do you know what I mean?

1155
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,167
You've broken his bloody heart,
but, of course,

1156
01:06:09,267 --> 01:06:11,651
as long as it don't affect you,
it don't matter, does it?

1157
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:14,101
You don't give a shit about
anyone but yourself, do you?

1158
01:06:14,201 --> 01:06:16,269
I don't want it no more, Jimmy.

1159
01:06:16,369 --> 01:06:18,402
I tell you,
I'm fed up with it.

1160
01:06:18,502 --> 01:06:19,634
What?

1161
01:06:19,734 --> 01:06:21,468
I don't want you 'round here anymore.

1162
01:06:21,568 --> 01:06:23,268
I don't want you bringing trouble

1163
01:06:23,368 --> 01:06:24,867
to my doorstep,
all right?

1164
01:06:24,967 --> 01:06:26,567
Have you got nothing
to say for yourself?

1165
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:29,435
What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to do?

1166
01:06:29,535 --> 01:06:31,801
I want you to go,
that's what I want you to do.

1167
01:06:31,901 --> 01:06:34,435
Well, it's not your fucking
house to tell me to go, is it?

1168
01:06:34,535 --> 01:06:35,836
Yeah, but I'm still married to him.

1169
01:06:35,936 --> 01:06:36,901
I still care about him.

1170
01:06:37,001 --> 01:06:38,669
He's the father of my bloody children.

1171
01:06:38,769 --> 01:06:40,101
What if my kids had been here?

1172
01:06:40,201 --> 01:06:41,567
I mean,

1173
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:43,033
you might not give a shit

1174
01:06:43,133 --> 01:06:45,002
about your kid,
but I care about my kids,

1175
01:06:45,102 --> 01:06:46,936
but you don't think about that,
do you?

1176
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:48,735
Because you're stupid.
Fuck off.

1177
01:06:48,835 --> 01:06:50,867
No, you fuck off.

1178
01:06:50,967 --> 01:06:53,000
Go on, get out. I'm sick
of the sight of you.

1179
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:56,202
Don't look at me like that.
Why don't you just go?

1180
01:06:56,302 --> 01:06:58,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1181
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,168
I think you'd better
pack your bag and I think

1182
01:07:00,268 --> 01:07:01,502
you'd better get off, mate.

1183
01:07:01,602 --> 01:07:02,934
Yeah, thanks,
Charlie.

1184
01:07:08,334 --> 01:07:09,200
Thanks, man.

1185
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,467
Pathetic.

1186
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:19,966
What's that?

1187
01:07:20,066 --> 01:07:21,768
What's that when it's at home?

1188
01:07:21,868 --> 01:07:23,385
Fucking that's what it is.

1189
01:07:23,485 --> 01:07:24,933
That's what it's about.

1190
01:07:25,033 --> 01:07:26,968
Right, that's what it's about.
You thieving.

1191
01:07:27,068 --> 01:07:28,000
Aye, fucking...

1192
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,035
I'm trying to better myself,
ain't I, Carol?

1193
01:07:30,135 --> 01:07:31,233
Better yourself?
Oh, lovely.

1194
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:32,600
What are you fucking complaining about?

1195
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,068
You've had a touch out
of this bag as well, and him.

1196
01:07:35,168 --> 01:07:36,667
Oh, lovely.
We ain't seen him for years.

1197
01:07:36,767 --> 01:07:38,936
We get a little present off him,
and that's all right.

1198
01:07:39,036 --> 01:07:39,933
You're mad in the head.

1199
01:07:40,033 --> 01:07:41,233
You're the fucking one that's mad.

1200
01:07:41,333 --> 01:07:43,168
You're the one that's mad,
going out thieving.

1201
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:44,368
I'm supposed to be your brother.

1202
01:07:44,468 --> 01:07:45,367
Brother?
Then act like it.

1203
01:07:45,467 --> 01:07:47,001
I've looked after you
all my bloody life.

1204
01:07:47,101 --> 01:07:49,333
I'm fed up with looking after you.

1205
01:07:49,433 --> 01:07:51,102
When have you ever
fucking looked after me?

1206
01:07:51,202 --> 01:07:52,836
I've looked after you
for the last 20 years!

1207
01:07:52,936 --> 01:07:54,653
When we were 15 years old,

1208
01:07:54,753 --> 01:07:56,400
I was the one that stopped you

1209
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,700
putting needles in your bloody arms.

1210
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,267
Ilooked after you.
16-year-old with Donna.

1211
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:02,335
On the fucking street
like a stupid wee lassie.

1212
01:08:02,435 --> 01:08:04,368
I was the fucking one
that took care of you.

1213
01:08:04,468 --> 01:08:05,867
You were around for two months, mate,

1214
01:08:05,967 --> 01:08:07,667
and don't you dare
bring my kid into this.

1215
01:08:07,767 --> 01:08:09,836
Go on, why don't you piss off
back to Jockland?

1216
01:08:09,936 --> 01:08:11,300
You're a fucking disgrace.

1217
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,268
You're an idiot.

1218
01:08:15,368 --> 01:08:17,133
Fucking disgrace?

1219
01:08:17,233 --> 01:08:19,001
I'm fucking ashamed
to call you a sister.

1220
01:08:19,101 --> 01:08:21,267
Fine. Don't, then.

1221
01:08:21,367 --> 01:08:24,168
You know, I live without you
all the time, baby.

1222
01:08:24,268 --> 01:08:27,035
Don't make no difference
to me now, you being here.

1223
01:08:27,135 --> 01:08:29,400
So that's it?

1224
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:32,368
Yeah, if that's the way you want it.

1225
01:08:32,468 --> 01:08:34,400
I don't know.

1226
01:08:53,634 --> 01:08:55,667
Hello?

1227
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:24,467
What are you doing?

1228
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:32,335
I thought you were in work.

1229
01:09:32,435 --> 01:09:34,669
I didn't go in.

1230
01:09:34,769 --> 01:09:36,734
Nor me.

1231
01:09:36,834 --> 01:09:40,101
Where have you been?

1232
01:09:40,201 --> 01:09:41,634
Oh, uh...

1233
01:09:41,734 --> 01:09:43,501
out and about.

1234
01:09:46,734 --> 01:09:48,868
I just came back
to get a few things together-

1235
01:09:48,968 --> 01:09:51,035
I don't want you to leave.
I don't want to leave.

1236
01:09:51,135 --> 01:09:52,767
Please don't go.

1237
01:09:52,867 --> 01:09:56,435
I'm not going to leave.

1238
01:09:56,535 --> 01:09:59,667
I just think...

1239
01:09:59,767 --> 01:10:02,268
I just think you need some...

1240
01:10:02,368 --> 01:10:04,267
time.

1241
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:07,235
Some space to think things through.

1242
01:10:07,335 --> 01:10:09,719
I'm so scared, Dek.

1243
01:10:09,819 --> 01:10:12,877
Don't be scared.

1244
01:10:12,977 --> 01:10:16,001
I'm so scared.

1245
01:10:16,101 --> 01:10:17,367
Shh.

1246
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:24,801
Oh, Dek...

1247
01:10:24,901 --> 01:10:27,836
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1248
01:10:27,936 --> 01:10:30,836
I forgot about you.

1249
01:10:30,936 --> 01:10:33,968
I'm sorry.

1250
01:10:43,234 --> 01:10:45,966
No. No.

1251
01:10:46,066 --> 01:10:48,635
Dek, nothing happened.

1252
01:10:48,735 --> 01:10:50,486
Nothing happened.

1253
01:10:50,586 --> 01:10:52,195
I can't, Shirley.

1254
01:10:52,295 --> 01:10:53,869
Nothing happened.

1255
01:10:53,969 --> 01:10:55,734
I can't.

1256
01:11:01,567 --> 01:11:05,535
I took them to Charlie's this morning.

1257
01:11:05,635 --> 01:11:06,667
Who?

1258
01:11:06,767 --> 01:11:09,502
Those men who were after Jimmy...

1259
01:11:09,602 --> 01:11:12,100
I showed them where he was.

1260
01:11:22,801 --> 01:11:25,567
Oh, my God.

1261
01:11:34,601 --> 01:11:36,135
Carol, stop it!

1262
01:11:36,235 --> 01:11:37,434
No.

1263
01:11:37,534 --> 01:11:38,667
That's enough.

1264
01:11:38,767 --> 01:11:40,268
Bollocks.
He deserves it, that poxy grass.

1265
01:11:40,368 --> 01:11:41,467
Carol, please.

1266
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,936
You see the state of Charlie's place?

1267
01:11:43,036 --> 01:11:44,333
Well, he deserves it as well.

1268
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:46,734
You come anywhere near me,
you numbnut,

1269
01:11:46,834 --> 01:11:49,101
and I'll knock your fucking block off!

1270
01:11:49,201 --> 01:11:50,669
Carol, listen.

1271
01:11:50,769 --> 01:11:52,167
Anyone get hurt?

1272
01:11:52,267 --> 01:11:53,502
We're all hurt,
Shirley.

1273
01:11:53,602 --> 01:11:55,933
All right?

1274
01:11:56,033 --> 01:11:57,502
Get away from that window!

1275
01:11:57,602 --> 01:11:58,801
Get in there!

1276
01:11:58,901 --> 01:12:01,235
That's it. I've done my bit.

1277
01:12:01,335 --> 01:12:03,286
Done my bit.

1278
01:12:03,386 --> 01:12:05,334
Get away.

1279
01:12:13,834 --> 01:12:15,066
No, I just...

1280
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:17,869
I just think you should just go, Dek.

1281
01:12:17,969 --> 01:12:20,701
I've just had enough now.

1282
01:12:56,534 --> 01:12:58,669
How are you getting
on there, Wordsworth?

1283
01:12:58,769 --> 01:13:01,202
Not bad. I've got the, uh...

1284
01:13:01,302 --> 01:13:02,801
who it's by.

1285
01:13:02,901 --> 01:13:04,502
I just made a name up.

1286
01:13:04,602 --> 01:13:06,335
What's the name?

1287
01:13:06,435 --> 01:13:07,836
Roger Myers.

1288
01:13:07,936 --> 01:13:09,133
Who?

1289
01:13:09,233 --> 01:13:10,669
Do you have to talk so loud?

1290
01:13:10,769 --> 01:13:12,667
I'm watching telly.

1291
01:13:12,767 --> 01:13:14,467
<i>Kids by Roger Myers.</i>

1292
01:13:33,801 --> 01:13:35,302
Hey, babe.

1293
01:13:35,402 --> 01:13:36,801
Is he in?

1294
01:13:36,901 --> 01:13:38,734
No, he's gone.
Where is he?

1295
01:13:38,834 --> 01:13:41,035
I don't know. He's...
He's left.

1296
01:13:41,135 --> 01:13:43,235
What, gone gone?
Yeah.

1297
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:46,167
Jesus.

1298
01:13:48,033 --> 01:13:51,084
They just fucking turned
their backs on me, Shirley.

1299
01:13:51,184 --> 01:13:54,168
Carol, she's thrown me out.
She went fucking ballistic.

1300
01:13:54,268 --> 01:13:55,534
Went crazy, threw me out.

1301
01:13:55,634 --> 01:13:58,435
You can't stay here, Jimmy.
You can't stay here.

1302
01:13:58,535 --> 01:14:01,302
Baby, come on, I'd wait
1000 years for you, Shirley,

1303
01:14:01,402 --> 01:14:03,469
but I'm in a bit of a spot.

1304
01:14:03,569 --> 01:14:05,267
You've got to go.

1305
01:14:05,367 --> 01:14:08,085
Baby, look, all I've got
is the gear on my back.

1306
01:14:08,185 --> 01:14:10,869
No, just don't, don't...
don't, Jimmy, please.

1307
01:14:10,969 --> 01:14:12,834
Man...

1308
01:14:12,934 --> 01:14:14,066
Look, babe-

1309
01:14:14,166 --> 01:14:15,951
You have to go.
Leave.

1310
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:17,767
What do you want me to do?

1311
01:14:17,867 --> 01:14:21,133
Do you want me to go back to Glasgow?

1312
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,567
Babe...

1313
01:14:24,667 --> 01:14:26,968
what do you want me to do?

1314
01:14:29,133 --> 01:14:33,100
<i>...overlooking Les Baux-de-Provence,</i>

1315
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:37,101
<i>regarded as one of the most</i>
<i>beautiful villages in France.</i>

1316
01:14:37,201 --> 01:14:38,669
Marlene, it's time to come home.

1317
01:14:38,769 --> 01:14:42,567
Can't I stay here tonight?

1318
01:14:42,667 --> 01:14:44,301
No, I'd like you to come home, please.

1319
01:14:44,401 --> 01:14:46,001
She's all right.
She can stay with me.

1320
01:14:46,101 --> 01:14:48,300
I don't mind, Shirley.
No.

1321
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,202
I really want you to come home.

1322
01:14:50,302 --> 01:14:51,867
Go on.

1323
01:14:51,967 --> 01:14:53,702
See you in a bit.

1324
01:14:53,802 --> 01:14:55,902
See you later.

1325
01:14:56,002 --> 01:14:57,669
See you, darling.

1326
01:14:57,769 --> 01:14:59,402
Goodnight, love.

1327
01:14:59,502 --> 01:15:01,133
Yeah. Baby.

1328
01:15:01,233 --> 01:15:03,235
Ah, she's dead delicate,
ain't she?

1329
01:15:03,335 --> 01:15:04,769
Who's delicate?

1330
01:15:04,869 --> 01:15:07,100
Me.

1331
01:15:10,267 --> 01:15:12,901
Jimmy.

1332
01:15:16,667 --> 01:15:21,302
Marlene, your dad's
come to stay for a bit.

1333
01:15:21,402 --> 01:15:22,869
Speak to him, please.

1334
01:15:22,969 --> 01:15:24,268
Please, Marlene.

1335
01:15:24,368 --> 01:15:25,700
No.

1336
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,400
Marlene, please.

1337
01:15:29,968 --> 01:15:31,367
She'll be fine, you know.

1338
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:45,933
* The summer days Are gone too soon *

1339
01:15:46,033 --> 01:15:52,251
* You shoot the moon
And miss completely *

1340
01:15:52,351 --> 01:15:58,611
* And now you're left
To face the gloom *

1341
01:15:58,711 --> 01:16:04,936
* The empty room
That once smelled sweetly *

1342
01:16:05,036 --> 01:16:08,569
* Of all the flowers you plant *

1343
01:16:08,669 --> 01:16:10,836
* If only *

1344
01:16:10,936 --> 01:16:13,033
Thanks, baby.

1345
01:16:13,133 --> 01:16:16,101
These pillows all right for you?

1346
01:16:16,201 --> 01:16:18,167
They're cool, yeah.

1347
01:16:18,267 --> 01:16:21,669
* Why you had To each be lonely *

1348
01:16:21,769 --> 01:16:23,268
See you in the morning.

1349
01:16:23,368 --> 01:16:25,233
Aye.

1350
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:29,267
* Was it just the season? *

1351
01:16:32,801 --> 01:16:39,535
* And now the fall Is here again *

1352
01:16:39,635 --> 01:16:43,569
* You can't begin to give in *

1353
01:16:43,669 --> 01:16:45,333
* It's all over *

1354
01:16:45,433 --> 01:16:51,801
* When the snows Come rolling through *

1355
01:16:51,901 --> 01:16:58,552
* You roll in too With some new lover *

1356
01:16:58,652 --> 01:17:05,268
* Will you think of times
You've told me *

1357
01:17:05,368 --> 01:17:11,600
* That you knew the reason *

1358
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:18,268
* Why we had To each be lonely? *

1359
01:17:18,368 --> 01:17:20,734
* It was just the season *

1360
01:17:20,834 --> 01:17:22,985
Well, you can get in with me, right,

1361
01:17:23,085 --> 01:17:25,202
but just for a cuddle,
and that's it.

1362
01:17:25,302 --> 01:17:26,966
Sound as a pound.

1363
01:17:27,066 --> 01:17:29,066
All right?
And I mean it,

1364
01:17:29,166 --> 01:17:31,268
you go anywhere you're not meant to go,

1365
01:17:31,368 --> 01:17:32,936
and I'll knock you out, all right?

1366
01:17:33,036 --> 01:17:33,901
Fine.

1367
01:17:34,001 --> 01:17:34,901
I've done it before, remember?

1368
01:17:35,001 --> 01:17:37,435
I won't rummage.
I won't rummage at all.

1369
01:17:37,535 --> 01:17:38,667
You watch yourself.

1370
01:17:38,767 --> 01:17:41,269
Rummage?
That's disgusting.

1371
01:17:41,369 --> 01:17:43,801
Well, you know what I mean.

1372
01:17:43,901 --> 01:17:47,767
I think the posh people
call it "caressing."

1373
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:58,535
* Will you think of times
You've told me *

1374
01:17:58,635 --> 01:18:00,302
Here all right,
then, huh?

1375
01:18:00,402 --> 01:18:01,986
What is it?

1376
01:18:02,086 --> 01:18:03,600
Bouncy castle.

1377
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:06,467
Yeah, but Jimmy,
I'm 12.

1378
01:18:06,567 --> 01:18:11,769
* Why we had To each be lonely *

1379
01:18:11,869 --> 01:18:17,836
* It was just the season *

1380
01:18:17,936 --> 01:18:20,167
* Oh **

1381
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:27,936
Do you want another packet of crisps?

1382
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,053
No, I've had four already

1383
01:18:30,153 --> 01:18:32,135
and my gums are killing.

1384
01:18:32,235 --> 01:18:33,901
Scratchy.

1385
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,836
Do you want anotherCoke?

1386
01:18:43,936 --> 01:18:46,434
No. Look, Jimmy,

1387
01:18:46,534 --> 01:18:48,834
you don't have to buy
me stuff, you know.

1388
01:19:09,133 --> 01:19:11,067
Do you not remember that?

1389
01:19:13,868 --> 01:19:16,434
I used to do that to you
when you were...

1390
01:19:18,434 --> 01:19:19,567
a wee baby.

1391
01:19:19,667 --> 01:19:22,767
Look, Jimmy, what do
you expect me to say?

1392
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:27,867
Nothing, baby.

1393
01:19:27,967 --> 01:19:30,435
Can't we just talk
about something else?

1394
01:19:30,535 --> 01:19:32,968
Sure.

1395
01:19:38,234 --> 01:19:40,400
Hey.

1396
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,435
All right?

1397
01:19:41,535 --> 01:19:42,667
Yeah.

1398
01:19:42,767 --> 01:19:44,836
Did you have a nice time?
Yeah, it was good.

1399
01:19:44,936 --> 01:19:46,903
Did you?
Yeah.

1400
01:19:47,003 --> 01:19:48,901
Where is he?

1401
01:19:49,001 --> 01:19:52,168
I think he's just down the road
talking to one of his mates.

1402
01:19:52,268 --> 01:19:53,886
What did you do?

1403
01:19:53,986 --> 01:19:55,534
Oh, all sorts.

1404
01:19:55,634 --> 01:19:57,367
Went for a meal,
went shopping.

1405
01:19:57,467 --> 01:19:59,702
Did you? Did he get you something nice?

1406
01:19:59,802 --> 01:20:00,901
Yeah.

1407
01:20:01,001 --> 01:20:02,302
What did he get you?

1408
01:20:02,402 --> 01:20:04,066
Oh, all sorts.

1409
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:05,669
Lots of special treats for you?

1410
01:20:05,769 --> 01:20:09,200
Yeah.
Good.

1411
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,168
What's the matter?

1412
01:20:15,268 --> 01:20:18,400
Marlene, what's wrong?

1413
01:20:21,133 --> 01:20:22,635
Marlene,
what's the matter?

1414
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:24,436
Nothing.

1415
01:20:24,536 --> 01:20:26,167
Hey.

1416
01:20:26,267 --> 01:20:27,836
There's nothing wrong.

1417
01:20:27,936 --> 01:20:29,434
What is it?

1418
01:20:31,534 --> 01:20:33,334
That's probably him now.

1419
01:20:36,767 --> 01:20:38,067
Ah, there you are.

1420
01:20:40,167 --> 01:20:41,634
Wondered where you got to.

1421
01:20:45,934 --> 01:20:47,033
Excellent.

1422
01:20:50,367 --> 01:20:51,669
Are you all right?

1423
01:20:51,769 --> 01:20:52,634
Marlene?

1424
01:20:52,734 --> 01:20:54,434
I'm going to go to my room.

1425
01:20:54,534 --> 01:20:56,502
Okay. I'll come up in a minute, yeah?

1426
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:57,567
Okay.

1427
01:20:57,667 --> 01:20:59,200
Don't go peeking in no bags now.

1428
01:21:01,334 --> 01:21:02,702
Your presents are for tomorrow.

1429
01:21:02,802 --> 01:21:04,452
I won't, don't worry.

1430
01:21:04,552 --> 01:21:06,168
I'll come up, Marlene.

1431
01:21:06,268 --> 01:21:07,234
Okay.

1432
01:21:15,767 --> 01:21:17,368
I think that went really well.

1433
01:21:17,468 --> 01:21:18,901
Yeah.

1434
01:21:19,001 --> 01:21:20,469
You get her a birthday present,

1435
01:21:20,569 --> 01:21:21,819
did you?

1436
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:23,100
Aye.

1437
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,968
That bear.

1438
01:21:25,068 --> 01:21:27,200
Yeah.

1439
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,802
It's going to take
a wee bit of time, you know?

1440
01:21:29,902 --> 01:21:32,067
Yeah, I know.

1441
01:21:42,567 --> 01:21:43,634
I'm starving.

1442
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:40,751
Hey.

1443
01:22:40,851 --> 01:22:42,400
Hi.

1444
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,068
Happy birthday.

1445
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:45,467
Thanks.

1446
01:22:47,667 --> 01:22:49,300
Oh, have you not waited for us?

1447
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,469
No, I'm going to go
into town with my mates.

1448
01:22:51,569 --> 01:22:53,434
Yeah?
Yeah.

1449
01:22:53,534 --> 01:22:55,968
Well, I were going to make us
a birthday tea later.

1450
01:22:56,068 --> 01:22:58,569
I'll probably be back by the afternoon.

1451
01:22:58,669 --> 01:23:01,734
Good.

1452
01:23:01,834 --> 01:23:04,767
How much did you get?
About 55 quid.

1453
01:23:04,867 --> 01:23:07,168
Did you? What are you
going to get with it?

1454
01:23:07,268 --> 01:23:08,500
Some clothes

1455
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,235
and I'm probably going to get

1456
01:23:10,335 --> 01:23:12,934
a new box for my watch.

1457
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:28,200
Are you missing Dek?

1458
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:34,300
A bit, yeah.

1459
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:40,200
I'm sorry,
sweetheart.

1460
01:23:42,534 --> 01:23:46,400
Jimmy's your dad.

1461
01:23:47,567 --> 01:23:51,300
Yeah?

1462
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,335
All right, Mum,
I'd best be going.

1463
01:23:53,435 --> 01:23:55,335
Be careful, yeah?

1464
01:23:55,435 --> 01:23:57,200
I will.

1465
01:24:56,868 --> 01:24:59,519
Gloves, check.

1466
01:24:59,619 --> 01:25:01,811
Fuel, check.

1467
01:25:01,911 --> 01:25:04,557
Oil, check.

1468
01:25:04,657 --> 01:25:07,233
Mirrors...

1469
01:25:07,333 --> 01:25:08,868
Virgin Mary, Mother of God,

1470
01:25:08,968 --> 01:25:10,434
what are you doing here?

1471
01:25:10,534 --> 01:25:12,035
When were you going to tell us

1472
01:25:12,135 --> 01:25:13,767
you were leaving?

1473
01:25:15,601 --> 01:25:17,933
Oh, yeah.

1474
01:25:18,033 --> 01:25:21,834
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1475
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,085
Oh, yeah.

1476
01:25:26,185 --> 01:25:27,767
Baby.

1477
01:25:27,867 --> 01:25:30,334
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

1478
01:25:33,367 --> 01:25:35,435
Oh, yeah.

1479
01:25:35,535 --> 01:25:37,535
Baby, baby.

1480
01:25:37,635 --> 01:25:39,703
Jimmy?

1481
01:25:39,803 --> 01:25:41,837
Baby.

1482
01:25:41,937 --> 01:25:43,603
Jimmy.

1483
01:25:43,703 --> 01:25:46,434
What?

1484
01:25:46,534 --> 01:25:48,300
Are you going to give me a hand here?

1485
01:25:49,701 --> 01:25:51,934
Doing a grand job yourself,
there, sweetheart.

1486
01:25:54,601 --> 01:25:56,667
Tell you what, Shirley, baby.

1487
01:25:58,701 --> 01:26:01,167
I could fair get used to this.

1488
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,836
What's the matter?

1489
01:26:12,936 --> 01:26:14,569
Hmm? Nothing.

1490
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:15,667
Nothing.

1491
01:26:15,767 --> 01:26:17,635
I just want it to be perfect
for Marlene.

1492
01:26:17,735 --> 01:26:18,767
It is perfect.

1493
01:26:18,867 --> 01:26:20,400
It's double perfect.

1494
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:23,335
Wee spread like that for a wee lassie.

1495
01:26:23,435 --> 01:26:25,619
Are you going to get changed?

1496
01:26:25,719 --> 01:26:27,901
I'm changed. Look at my hat.

1497
01:26:30,667 --> 01:26:32,267
Oh, aye, it's going to be perfect.

1498
01:26:32,367 --> 01:26:34,902
Do you want to know how I know
it's going to be perfect?

1499
01:26:35,002 --> 01:26:37,169
No. How do you know
it's going to be perfect?

1500
01:26:37,269 --> 01:26:39,402
Do you know how I know
it's going to be perfect?

1501
01:26:39,502 --> 01:26:40,634
No.

1502
01:26:40,734 --> 01:26:42,000
Because I'm here.

1503
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,067
You'll break the chair.

1504
01:26:47,667 --> 01:26:49,702
Here you are.
Ta.

1505
01:26:49,802 --> 01:26:51,234
Cheers.

1506
01:27:04,968 --> 01:27:06,567
I won't sing the song.

1507
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,702
Well, go on, then.

1508
01:27:13,802 --> 01:27:15,601
Blow it out.

1509
01:27:20,767 --> 01:27:22,302
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

1510
01:27:22,402 --> 01:27:24,300
Thanks.

1511
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,869
Are you going to make a wish?

1512
01:27:25,969 --> 01:27:27,669
I already have done.

1513
01:27:27,769 --> 01:27:29,435
I want to come with you.

1514
01:27:29,535 --> 01:27:32,567
Oh, Marlene...

1515
01:27:32,667 --> 01:27:35,868
I'd love you to come with me,
but you can't.

1516
01:27:35,968 --> 01:27:39,135
See, I can't take you away
from your mum.

1517
01:27:39,235 --> 01:27:42,167
It would kill her.

1518
01:27:42,267 --> 01:27:43,702
What,
so you're just going to leave?

1519
01:27:43,802 --> 01:27:45,233
Piss off without even trying?

1520
01:27:45,333 --> 01:27:48,235
Hey, come on, don't
use that language now.

1521
01:27:48,335 --> 01:27:50,536
Dek, you're just like Jimmy.

1522
01:27:50,636 --> 01:27:52,802
I'm nothing like Jimmy, Marlene.

1523
01:27:52,902 --> 01:27:54,936
Jimmy left, you're leaving.

1524
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:56,334
What's the difference?

1525
01:27:59,133 --> 01:28:01,467
I didn't want to go, sweetheart.

1526
01:28:03,701 --> 01:28:05,934
That's the difference.

1527
01:28:07,434 --> 01:28:09,569
Guess how many times
I've seen them now,

1528
01:28:09,669 --> 01:28:10,834
Shirley.
I don't know.

1529
01:28:10,934 --> 01:28:12,669
Guess how many times.
I don't know.

1530
01:28:12,769 --> 01:28:14,734
Twenty-seven.
27 times, man.

1531
01:28:14,834 --> 01:28:18,569
Just keep getting better and better.

1532
01:28:18,669 --> 01:28:20,669
* Whatever you want *

1533
01:28:20,769 --> 01:28:22,402
* Whatever you like *

1534
01:28:22,502 --> 01:28:24,066
* Whatever you say *

1535
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:25,200
Will you play my guitar?

1536
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,836
No, I don't want to play the guitar.

1537
01:28:26,936 --> 01:28:28,068
Want to pluck me, baby?

1538
01:28:28,168 --> 01:28:29,101
I don't want to.

1539
01:28:29,201 --> 01:28:30,185
Come on.

1540
01:28:30,285 --> 01:28:31,200
Stop it.

1541
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:32,751
Will you turn it down, please?

1542
01:28:32,851 --> 01:28:34,268
Oh, come on.
It's brilliant, man.

1543
01:28:34,368 --> 01:28:35,333
Oh, God.

1544
01:28:35,433 --> 01:28:36,618
* You're showing off *

1545
01:28:36,718 --> 01:28:37,834
* You're showing out *

1546
01:28:37,934 --> 01:28:39,335
I'm going to nip over to Carol's

1547
01:28:39,435 --> 01:28:40,669
and see if Marlene's there.

1548
01:28:40,769 --> 01:28:42,503
* Give me a shout *

1549
01:28:42,603 --> 01:28:44,267
* I take it all *

1550
01:28:44,367 --> 01:28:45,619
* You squeeze my dry *

1551
01:28:45,719 --> 01:28:46,901
Where are you going?

1552
01:28:47,001 --> 01:28:50,834
* And now today
You couldn't even say goodbye **

1553
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:20,501
Look, are you going
to change your mind or what?

1554
01:29:23,167 --> 01:29:24,801
No.

1555
01:29:27,968 --> 01:29:29,233
What are you doing?

1556
01:29:29,333 --> 01:29:31,435
You can stuff your bloody
watch. I don't want it.

1557
01:29:31,535 --> 01:29:33,335
Oh, Marlene,
we can't part like this.

1558
01:29:33,435 --> 01:29:34,535
I don't want it, Dek.

1559
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:37,452
Marlene, please.

1560
01:29:37,552 --> 01:29:40,300
Please, darling.

1561
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:44,335
Dek, what is it that you're scared of?

1562
01:29:44,435 --> 01:29:47,286
I'm not scared.

1563
01:29:47,386 --> 01:29:50,234
Not anymore.

1564
01:29:55,801 --> 01:29:57,801
Marlene...

1565
01:30:00,667 --> 01:30:03,468
Marlene,
look at me.

1566
01:30:03,568 --> 01:30:06,334
She doesn't want me.

1567
01:30:09,634 --> 01:30:12,567
What else can I do?

1568
01:30:23,701 --> 01:30:25,033
Marlene?

1569
01:30:57,567 --> 01:30:59,468
What's going on, Dek?

1570
01:30:59,568 --> 01:31:01,367
Oh, Shirley, I...

1571
01:31:01,467 --> 01:31:03,168
I don't know where to start.

1572
01:31:03,268 --> 01:31:04,467
Sorry?

1573
01:31:07,868 --> 01:31:10,802
I was leaving town forever this morning

1574
01:31:10,902 --> 01:31:13,203
till Marlene popped up in the back seat

1575
01:31:13,303 --> 01:31:15,569
and told me she wanted
to elope with me...

1576
01:31:15,669 --> 01:31:16,767
Elope?

1577
01:31:18,667 --> 01:31:20,735
and I had to bring her home, Shirley,

1578
01:31:20,835 --> 01:31:22,268
or she would have run away...

1579
01:31:22,368 --> 01:31:24,719
Oh, my God.

1580
01:31:24,819 --> 01:31:27,100
Oh, Dek.

1581
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:30,869
but that's not
the important bit, Shirley.

1582
01:31:30,969 --> 01:31:32,069
Excuse me?

1583
01:31:32,169 --> 01:31:33,200
See, uh...

1584
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:36,768
I thought I was meant to leave,

1585
01:31:36,868 --> 01:31:40,334
but I'm here now, aren't I?

1586
01:31:42,801 --> 01:31:44,202
And so are you.

1587
01:31:44,302 --> 01:31:45,500
Yeah.

1588
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,335
I don't understand you, Dek.

1589
01:31:48,435 --> 01:31:49,434
I don't.

1590
01:31:52,834 --> 01:31:55,834
I love you,

1591
01:31:55,934 --> 01:31:58,734
and I love your daughter...

1592
01:32:01,801 --> 01:32:06,035
and I never want to leave you, ever,

1593
01:32:06,135 --> 01:32:07,836
and whatever it takes,

1594
01:32:07,936 --> 01:32:09,767
whatever,

1595
01:32:09,867 --> 01:32:12,200
I'm not going anywhere, Shirley.

1596
01:32:15,934 --> 01:32:19,101
I want to be with you
for the rest of my life.

1597
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:20,567
I want to grow old with you...

1598
01:32:23,334 --> 01:32:25,834
till one of us...

1599
01:32:25,934 --> 01:32:27,634
dies in the other's arms.

1600
01:32:38,634 --> 01:32:43,202
It's me you should be with,
Shirley, not Jimmy.

1601
01:32:43,302 --> 01:32:47,467
You should be with me.

1602
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:56,200
Oh, God.

1603
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:57,968
This looks cozy.

1604
01:33:04,033 --> 01:33:06,501
Am I missing something here?

1605
01:33:12,868 --> 01:33:14,069
All right, Marlene?

1606
01:33:14,169 --> 01:33:15,267
Birthday cake's

1607
01:33:15,367 --> 01:33:18,267
melting in here,
darling. Let's go.

1608
01:33:23,234 --> 01:33:25,469
Come on, Shirley. Stop
messing about. Let's go.

1609
01:33:25,569 --> 01:33:27,634
Marlene, inside the house.
Let's move.

1610
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:34,402
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

1611
01:33:34,502 --> 01:33:36,534
Hey, who fucking asked you?

1612
01:33:36,634 --> 01:33:39,035
Don't be fucking telling my
daughter what to do, okay?

1613
01:33:39,135 --> 01:33:40,600
Marlene, shift.

1614
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:42,702
She's not a dog, Jimmy.
Fuck off.

1615
01:33:42,802 --> 01:33:44,233
Oh, God.

1616
01:33:44,333 --> 01:33:45,968
Just fuck off.

1617
01:33:47,968 --> 01:33:49,335
Shirley, Marlene, inside.

1618
01:33:49,435 --> 01:33:50,567
Let's go.

1619
01:34:08,133 --> 01:34:10,133
No, Dek, please don't.
No, it's okay.

1620
01:34:13,033 --> 01:34:16,268
Listen, Jimmy.

1621
01:34:16,368 --> 01:34:18,252
Take Baby

1622
01:34:18,352 --> 01:34:20,167
and just...

1623
01:34:20,267 --> 01:34:22,801
flip off back to Glasgow,
will you?

1624
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:28,267
No!

1625
01:34:28,367 --> 01:34:29,418
Fucking hell.

1626
01:34:29,518 --> 01:34:30,527
My fucking lip.

1627
01:34:30,627 --> 01:34:31,567
Sorry, Jimmy.

1628
01:34:31,667 --> 01:34:33,200
Fuck. Fuck's sake.

1629
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:34,836
Are you all right,
mate? I'm sorry.

1630
01:34:34,936 --> 01:34:35,901
Fuck off.

1631
01:34:36,001 --> 01:34:37,066
Fuck off.
Sorry.

1632
01:34:37,166 --> 01:34:39,735
Fucking hit me there.
Fuck's sake.

1633
01:34:39,835 --> 01:34:41,135
Sorry, are you all right?

1634
01:34:41,235 --> 01:34:43,635
Marlene, come here.

1635
01:34:43,735 --> 01:34:44,667
Sorry.

1636
01:34:44,767 --> 01:34:46,168
He just fucking hit me there.

1637
01:34:46,268 --> 01:34:47,502
Is it bad?

1638
01:34:47,602 --> 01:34:48,669
Is it?

1639
01:34:48,769 --> 01:34:49,767
Is it bad?

1640
01:34:49,867 --> 01:34:50,901
It's all right.

1641
01:34:51,001 --> 01:34:52,968
Come on, baby. You and me, eh?
Let's go, man.

1642
01:34:53,068 --> 01:34:54,068
No, stop it.
Inside.

1643
01:34:54,168 --> 01:34:55,200
Come on.
No.

1644
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:56,669
It's not about you and me,
Jimmy.

1645
01:34:56,769 --> 01:34:57,700
What?

1646
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:59,135
It's always been about you.

1647
01:34:59,235 --> 01:35:01,100
What?

1648
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,418
This was a family.

1649
01:35:03,518 --> 01:35:05,702
It's our family.

1650
01:35:05,802 --> 01:35:07,400
No, no.

1651
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,968
This is my family.

1652
01:35:09,068 --> 01:35:10,500
What?

1653
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:13,367
I don't want you to break it up.

1654
01:35:15,767 --> 01:35:18,669
I just want you to go.
It's too late.

1655
01:35:18,769 --> 01:35:21,802
You're three years too late.

1656
01:35:21,902 --> 01:35:24,936
It's over, Jimmy.

1657
01:35:25,036 --> 01:35:28,067
I want you to leave.

1658
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:32,901
You'll be all right.

1659
01:35:36,267 --> 01:35:37,734
Dek, it's you I love.

1660
01:35:40,267 --> 01:35:42,334
It's always been you.

1661
01:35:44,968 --> 01:35:48,100
* Adia I do believe I failed you *

1662
01:35:50,701 --> 01:35:54,501
* Adia I know I've let you down *

1663
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,368
* Don't you know I tried so hard *

1664
01:35:59,468 --> 01:36:02,267
* To love you in my way? *

1665
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:08,734
* It's easy, let it go *

1666
01:36:14,334 --> 01:36:18,300
* Adia I'm empty since you left me *

1667
01:36:20,534 --> 01:36:24,033
* Trying to find a way To carry on *

1668
01:36:26,601 --> 01:36:29,452
* I search myself and everyone *

1669
01:36:29,552 --> 01:36:32,511
* To see where we went wrong *

1670
01:36:32,611 --> 01:36:35,507
* There's no one left To finger *

1671
01:36:35,607 --> 01:36:38,434
* There's no one here to blame *

1672
01:36:38,534 --> 01:36:41,867
* There's no one left
To talk to, honey *

1673
01:36:41,967 --> 01:36:46,502
* And there ain't no one
To buy our innocence *

1674
01:36:46,602 --> 01:36:53,368
* 'Cause we are born innocent *

1675
01:36:53,468 --> 01:36:56,734
* Believe me, Adia *

1676
01:36:56,834 --> 01:37:01,918
* We are still innocent *

1677
01:37:02,018 --> 01:37:07,033
* It's easy We all falter *

1678
01:37:07,133 --> 01:37:08,767
<i>...and are now thinking</i>

1679
01:37:08,867 --> 01:37:11,302
<i>about swapping their Ascot home</i>

1680
01:37:11,402 --> 01:37:13,802
<i>for a taste of the Miami high life.</i>

1681
01:37:13,902 --> 01:37:17,303
* Adia, I thought
That we could make it *

1682
01:37:17,403 --> 01:37:20,087
Fishing? Now I've stolen my own boat,

1683
01:37:20,187 --> 01:37:22,836
I can see myself
on the ocean, you know.

1684
01:37:22,936 --> 01:37:24,000
In that?
Aye.

1685
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:25,033
I'll come with you, man.

1686
01:37:25,133 --> 01:37:26,501
You'll kill yourself.
It's ridiculous.

1687
01:37:28,133 --> 01:37:30,068
Thought it was you,
you fucking scumbags.

1688
01:37:30,168 --> 01:37:32,185
Hey, where's my money,
you wee bastard?

1689
01:37:32,285 --> 01:37:34,268
Any of you know the way to Glasgow?

1690
01:37:34,368 --> 01:37:37,068
Jimmy, can I come with you?

1691
01:37:37,168 --> 01:37:38,534
Upstairs.

1692
01:37:38,634 --> 01:37:39,834
Let's go to the back.

1693
01:37:39,934 --> 01:37:41,802
Not in the back.
There's people down there.

1694
01:37:41,902 --> 01:37:43,635
Don't make me sit on the end.

1695
01:37:43,735 --> 01:37:45,167
Come on, sit here.

1696
01:37:45,267 --> 01:37:48,235
No, sit over there.
Oh, move up, Shirl.

1697
01:37:48,335 --> 01:37:50,802
Come on, let's sit together.

1698
01:37:50,902 --> 01:37:53,986
No, don't start squashing me.

1699
01:37:54,086 --> 01:37:57,100
Ah! Oh! No, I don't like it.

1700
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:58,300
Right, don't abandon me now, girls.

1701
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,368
Just let me get my balance.
I'll be all right.

1702
01:38:00,468 --> 01:38:02,469
Give me your hand.
Give us your hand.

1703
01:38:02,569 --> 01:38:04,434
I'll be okay.
No, hang on.

1704
01:38:04,534 --> 01:38:07,035
It's slipperier
than last time, isn't it?

1705
01:38:07,135 --> 01:38:09,066
Right, come on.
Hang on.

1706
01:38:09,166 --> 01:38:11,702
Just let me steady myself.
Right, that way.

1707
01:38:11,802 --> 01:38:13,667
Yeah.
Come on, let's go.

1708
01:38:20,701 --> 01:38:21,933
It's not me.

1709
01:38:22,033 --> 01:38:24,167
That would be brilliant.
Oh, God!

1710
01:38:30,734 --> 01:38:31,966
All right?
Yeah.

1711
01:38:32,066 --> 01:38:34,268
Shall we go for a pizza after?
What?

1712
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:37,933
* Innocent *

1713
01:38:38,033 --> 01:38:40,367
* Believe me, Adia *

1714
01:38:40,467 --> 01:38:42,567
No, just look straight ahead.

1715
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:44,467
Dek, stop it,
because I'll fall over.

1716
01:38:45,534 --> 01:38:48,033
That's better.

1717
01:38:48,133 --> 01:38:53,135
* It's easy We all falter *

1718
01:38:53,235 --> 01:38:55,133
I'm going!

1719
01:38:55,233 --> 01:38:57,818
* Doesn't matter *

1720
01:38:57,918 --> 01:39:00,434
* Believe me, Adia *

1721
01:39:00,534 --> 01:39:05,467
* We are still innocent *

1722
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:15,469
* 'Cause we are born innocent *

1723
01:39:15,569 --> 01:39:19,367
* Believe me, Adia *

1724
01:39:19,467 --> 01:39:25,402
* We are still innocent *

1725
01:39:25,502 --> 01:39:31,402
* It's easy We all falter *

1726
01:39:31,502 --> 01:39:34,534
* Does it matter? *

1727
01:39:53,434 --> 01:39:59,836
* 'Cause we are born innocent *

1728
01:39:59,936 --> 01:40:03,300
* Believe me, Adia *

1729
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:09,502
* We are still innocent *

1730
01:40:09,602 --> 01:40:15,669
* It's easy We all falter *

1731
01:40:15,769 --> 01:40:19,203
* Does it matter? *

1732
01:40:19,303 --> 01:40:22,667
* Believe me, Adia *

1733
01:40:22,767 --> 01:40:30,233
* We are still innocent *

1734
01:40:30,333 --> 01:40:38,135
* 'Cause we are born innocent *

1735
01:40:38,235 --> 01:40:41,267
* Believe me, Adia *

1736
01:40:41,367 --> 01:40:47,435
* We are still innocent *

1737
01:40:47,535 --> 01:40:53,569
* It's easy We all falter *

1738
01:40:53,669 --> 01:40:56,734
* Does it matter? **

1739
01:41:10,868 --> 01:41:15,234
* Today I'm standin'
On the brink of tomorrow *

1740
01:41:18,801 --> 01:41:24,000
* Watchin'
As the day just passes me by *

1741
01:41:27,434 --> 01:41:34,218
* Thinkin' about the joy
And the sorrow *

1742
01:41:34,318 --> 01:41:41,067
* Brings a little teardrop To my eye *

1743
01:41:43,701 --> 01:41:48,801
* Yesterday
We pledged our love together *

1744
01:41:52,067 --> 01:41:57,067
* We said that we'd
Just stand side by side *

1745
01:41:59,968 --> 01:42:06,869
* But today you're on the arm
Of another *

1746
01:42:06,969 --> 01:42:13,834
* Taking vows As someone else's bride *

1747
01:42:16,601 --> 01:42:24,600
* Tomorrow *

1748
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:29,834
* They say it never arrives *

1749
01:42:33,167 --> 01:42:37,051
* But if you only knew *

1750
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:41,827
* How much that I love you *

1751
01:42:41,927 --> 01:42:46,601
* Then would surely realize *

1752
01:42:49,467 --> 01:42:55,100
* Looking back to when
Our love first started *

1753
01:42:57,467 --> 01:43:02,434
* It's funny How time just passes by *

1754
01:43:06,334 --> 01:43:14,035
* And even though today
We will be parted *

1755
01:43:14,135 --> 01:43:19,234
* My love for you Could never die *

1756
01:43:22,667 --> 01:43:29,901
* Tomorrow *

1757
01:43:30,001 --> 01:43:35,934
* They say it never arrives *

1758
01:43:38,834 --> 01:43:42,602
* But now that I can see *

1759
01:43:42,702 --> 01:43:46,367
* How much you meant to me *

1760
01:43:46,467 --> 01:43:52,567
* I was a fool To never realize *

1761
01:43:55,567 --> 01:44:02,966
* Tomorrow *

1762
01:44:03,066 --> 01:44:09,567
* I was fool To never realize **
