1
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:05,606
- I miss you, Satinin'.
- I miss you.

2
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:11,028
- I waited up all night for you to call.
- We went on an all-night bivouac.

3
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:16,826
I just got back a while ago
and cleaned up.

4
00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:19,245
They treating you right?

5
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:22,373
They don't treat you decent
I'm going to call that President myself.

6
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:27,294
They're treating me fine, Mama.

7
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,756
Some of the guys gave me some static.

8
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:33,926
When they see I'm like everybody else,
they cool down.

9
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:39,306
It's all over, Mama.

10
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:42,268
They're not gonna remember me
when I come back.

11
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:44,186
Of course they are, baby.

12
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:47,314
You just got to trust the Colonel.

13
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:52,486
I miss you, Elvis.

14
00:00:53,404 --> 00:00:56,574
I miss you, Mama.

15
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:02,121
Mama, I gotta go now.

16
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:05,249
The drill sergeant wakes me up
about the time I used to go to bed.

17
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,838
You really got to go?

18
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:15,593
I guess not.

19
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,929
I ain't got a lot to say though, Mama.

20
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:22,099
You don't gotta say nothing, baby.

21
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:25,770
Just don't hang up.

22
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:46,248
Hey, Presley.

23
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,168
There's this rule that lets enlisted men

24
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,296
live off-base with their families
if they're nearby.

25
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,010
This house is going to do just fine.

26
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:01,138
They're gonna like it. We're gonna
line one up in Germany, right?

27
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:04,517
- I want 'em there, too.
- It'll be taken care of.

28
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:05,935
Good.

29
00:02:05,976 --> 00:02:09,063
This general asked me
if I wanted to work for the USO.

30
00:02:09,146 --> 00:02:12,108
- Entertain the troops.
- For free?

31
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:14,860
I got a call like that.
From the White House.

32
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:18,030
Would Elvis like to sing for
the President? "How much?" I asked.

33
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:21,659
Does the President work for free?
No, we stick to our principles.

34
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,079
Meanwhile, I piddle away my career.

35
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:28,207
Our career. I built it, I can keep it
going whether you're out there or not.

36
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,753
Your name's in the paper every week.
Magazines every month.

37
00:02:33,838 --> 00:02:36,465
Your records are selling
as I parcel 'em out.

38
00:02:36,507 --> 00:02:39,635
King Creole is doing well, and
I'm negotiating a couple more films.

39
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:43,430
You got no room to complain.

40
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:47,893
Hello.

41
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:50,855
Hi, Daddy.

42
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:52,857
What's wrong?

43
00:02:52,857 --> 00:02:55,401
When?

44
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:58,154
Oh, my God. I'm on my way.

45
00:02:58,195 --> 00:03:01,282
- What's wrong?
- Mama's in hospital. It's her liver.

46
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:04,618
- I gotta pack and get to Memphis.
- Now? You can't do that.

47
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:06,704
Why the hell not?

48
00:03:06,704 --> 00:03:09,874
You think you'll get special allowance
because you're Elvis Presley?

49
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,711
- Quite the opposite, in fact.
- I'm going.

50
00:03:13,711 --> 00:03:16,881
- Go AWOL, and they'll ruin you.
- Don't you give me that crap.

51
00:03:17,214 --> 00:03:19,925
You say you're the great snowman,
go snow 'em.

52
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:23,053
You brag about being able to twist
everyone around your pinkie finger,

53
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:27,141
you work your magic, Colonel, and
do it now, or, by God, we're through.

54
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:48,078
Mama?

55
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:58,422
Mama.

56
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:04,261
Come on, let me see
that beautiful face of yours, baby.

57
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:19,610
It's gonna be all right.

58
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:40,548
Mama!

59
00:04:50,474 --> 00:04:53,394
She's gone, Daddy.

60
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:56,564
Our Satinin' is gone forever.

61
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,317
Why would God take her away from us?

62
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:03,487
- [Elvis Presley: Loving You]
- Winter, summer, springtime too

63
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:12,079
Loving you

64
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,916
Loving you

65
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,587
Makes no difference where I go

66
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:25,509
Or what I do

67
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:30,347
Doesn't she look beautiful?

68
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:34,435
She loved you guys very much.

69
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:42,735
Oh, Red.

70
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:45,696
I'm so sorry, man.

71
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:47,948
- I'm so sorry.
- I know.

72
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:51,118
Look, I'm out of the Marines now,

73
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:55,539
so I'm back if you need me, OK?

74
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:59,627
Thanks, man.

75
00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:05,216
Look who I found out at the gate.

76
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:16,393
Oh, she loved you, Dixie.

77
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:19,814
We all loved her, Elvis.

78
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:23,150
I killed her.

79
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,320
All that worry about me traveling.

80
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,157
She wanted me to quit and kept asking me
over and over, and I wouldn't quit.

81
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:41,585
She's gone, man.

82
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,184
America's latest export to Europe
is not the Hula-Hoop or Coca-Cola

83
00:06:57,935 --> 00:06:59,687
but the king of rock 'n'roll.

84
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:02,857
Elvis Presley has changed
his Hollywood limousine for a tank,

85
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:06,444
as he patrols in Germany
with the Third Armored Division.

86
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,529
America salutes you.

87
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:20,291
Elvis.

88
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:32,511
Just keep your hands
away from his mouth.

89
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:35,639
We're having a party tonight.
Some of my Army buddies are coming.

90
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:39,143
Currie Grant, Esposito
and Charlie Hodge.

91
00:07:39,143 --> 00:07:42,313
Charlie Hodge.
Don't he just act like he knows it all?

92
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:45,483
- Thank you, Grandma.
- That ain't funny.

93
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,822
Where you been all night, Daddy?

94
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:54,533
Out with friends.

95
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,619
Friends my ass.

96
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,829
You were with that Stanley woman.

97
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:01,999
- I know what's going on. She's married.
- It ain't none of your nevermind.

98
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,878
It's been just three months.

99
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,006
- You're cheating on two people.
- Look, Elvis.

100
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,010
I loved your mama
as much as a man can love a woman.

101
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:16,514
But I'm tired of crying.
I'm a lonely man.

102
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:19,391
It's an insult to her memory.

103
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,393
You watch your mouth, son.

104
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:24,522
I know what you've been up to with
those French hooch dancers in Paris.

105
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,191
What would your mama say?

106
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:30,194
I'm the one who pays the bills.
Don't ever forget it.

107
00:08:30,194 --> 00:08:33,030
How can we forget it
when you keep reminding us

108
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,200
every time you
don't get your way?

109
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,631
Thanks, babe.

110
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:53,092
- Elvis, you ever listen to opera?
- What?

111
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:55,219
Sure. Yeah, I love Caruso.

112
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:58,389
And what's the other guy?
The Lion. Titta Ruffo.

113
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,060
Listen to this.

114
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:14,405
- Yeah, I love this.
- You could sing this too, you know.

115
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:17,575
You got the register and the range.
You love gospel.

116
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:21,245
Not much difference.

117
00:09:35,718 --> 00:09:38,012
Well, what do we have here?

118
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:41,182
This is Priscilla Beaulieu. This is
the girl I've been telling you about.

119
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:45,603
Hi. I'm Elvis Presley.

120
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:48,773
Hi.

121
00:09:49,565 --> 00:09:52,693
Come and sit down next to me.

122
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,535
- So do you go to school?
- Yeah.

123
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:04,455
And what are you? Junior? Senior?

124
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:06,832
- Ninth.
- Ninth what?

125
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:09,960
- Grade.
- Ninth grade?

126
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:13,964
- Man, you're just a baby.
- Well, thanks a lot.

127
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:18,135
Well, the girl's got spunk.

128
00:10:22,473 --> 00:10:25,518
- Do you have to go?
- It's way past my curfew.

129
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,770
My daddy's gonna kill me.

130
00:10:27,812 --> 00:10:30,940
I'm sorry to hear that.

131
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,820
- Good night, Priscilla.
- Good night.

132
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:42,993
Good night, Currie.
See you on the base.

133
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:53,337
Did you see that face? Those eyes?

134
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,090
I've been looking for that woman
my whole life.

135
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,260
- She's really young.
- That's OK.

136
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:02,763
That just means I can raise her
to be the woman I want her to be.

137
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:06,434
God Almighty, man, she's as cute
as a bug, but she's just 14.

138
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,940
You could go to prison for life.

139
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:17,736
It might be worth it, Daddy.

140
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:25,286
Love me tender

141
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:28,581
Love me dear

142
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:31,709
Tell me you are mine

143
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:37,965
I'll be yours through all the years

144
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:44,054
Till the end of time

145
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:50,227
Love me tender

146
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:53,272
Love me true

147
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:56,400
All my dreams fulfill

148
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,157
For my darling I love you

149
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,497
And I always will♪

150
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:20,925
I'm so glad you came back.
I didn't know if you would.

151
00:12:21,258 --> 00:12:24,428
- I didn't think you'd ask me.
- Oh, honey.

152
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:29,683
I want to be alone with you.

153
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,020
- Well, we are alone.
- No.

154
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,357
I meant really alone.

155
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:40,903
Would you come upstairs to my room?

156
00:12:40,945 --> 00:12:43,239
Don't be afraid.

157
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,367
I would never do anything
to harm you, Priscilla. Ever.

158
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:51,413
I'll treat you like my sister.

159
00:12:51,455 --> 00:12:54,542
Please.

160
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:58,546
- All right.
- All right.

161
00:12:58,796 --> 00:13:01,882
You go on up first, and I'll be up
in a minute. It'll look better.

162
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:06,137
Okay.

163
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:13,853
It was nice to talk to someone.

164
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:16,981
I miss that.

165
00:13:17,481 --> 00:13:20,568
- Gets lonely here.
- Are you going home soon?

166
00:13:21,318 --> 00:13:23,654
In six months, yeah.

167
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:26,073
But we won't quit then.

168
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:29,243
I feel like we're close.

169
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:33,998
How I just wish Mama'd
been there to meet you.

170
00:13:34,415 --> 00:13:36,876
She would have liked you
as much as I do.

171
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,795
I wish I could have met her, too.

172
00:13:39,837 --> 00:13:42,923
There's this photograph of her
when she was your age.

173
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,260
Oh, man.
You look an awful lot like she did.

174
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:51,599
Same eyes.

175
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:56,687
Beautiful cheekbones.

176
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:03,277
My father says if you expect
to see me again he's got to meet you.

177
00:14:04,695 --> 00:14:07,865
I'll meet any man to keep you.

178
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:17,750
Slow down.

179
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:20,753
We've plenty of time, little one.

180
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:23,881
Sir, right now I'm driving a jeep
for the Third Armored Division.

181
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:28,719
I guess you're very anxious
to get home, huh?

182
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,057
Yes, sir. Only six more months now.

183
00:14:33,724 --> 00:14:36,268
How do you like being stationed here?

184
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,104
We love it.

185
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:41,232
Couldn't be happier.
We're gonna be here three more years.

186
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:46,612
Let's get down to brass tacks, Elvis.

187
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:49,740
You got women coming at you from
every direction, all over the place.

188
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:53,661
Why do you want to date my daughter?

189
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:56,831
Well, sir, I happen to be
very fond of your daughter.

190
00:14:57,498 --> 00:15:00,668
She's a lot more mature than her age,
and I like her company.

191
00:15:01,836 --> 00:15:04,922
It hasn't been easy for me,
bein' away from home and all.

192
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:08,175
I guess you might say
I needed someone to talk to.

193
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:11,512
You don't have to worry, Captain,
Mrs Beaulieu,

194
00:15:13,264 --> 00:15:16,350
I'll take good care of her.

195
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:28,028
No, please, I want to do it.
Please. I love you.

196
00:15:30,114 --> 00:15:31,949
I've learned to love you.

197
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:35,119
But Daddy keeps reminding me
of your age.

198
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:38,289
I could get into a lot of trouble
for this, Cilla.

199
00:15:40,124 --> 00:15:43,294
- Maybe when I go home...
- I don't want you to go.

200
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:47,173
I'm kinda mixed up about me and you.

201
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:50,301
I mean, maybe me being away
will help me to figure things out.

202
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:54,138
That's all the more reason
for us to do it.

203
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:57,308
At least I'll have that
to remember you by.

204
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:03,147
No.

205
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:06,317
Some day but not yet.

206
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:10,404
You're just too young.

207
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:16,744
Come on, it's time to go.
I promised your daddy.

208
00:16:20,164 --> 00:16:22,041
Are you tired?

209
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,043
No, I'm OK.

210
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:27,171
I'm tired cos you and me stay up so late
and I have to be at school by seven.

211
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:31,091
How you doin' at school?

212
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:34,261
Finding it hard to stay awake
in some classes. Like in algebra.

213
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:36,722
I got a D.

214
00:16:36,764 --> 00:16:39,850
If my dad finds out
he is going to kill me.

215
00:16:40,935 --> 00:16:44,105
Here.

216
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,276
If you get tired, take these.
They'll help you stay awake.

217
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:53,197
No more than one,
or you'll be doing cartwheels.

218
00:16:53,197 --> 00:16:55,866
- What are they?
- Don't worry, they're safe.

219
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:58,077
They give them to us on maneuvers.

220
00:16:58,119 --> 00:17:00,704
Put them in your pocket.
Don't tell anybody.

221
00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:03,874
Don't take them every day.
Only when you need energy.

222
00:17:03,874 --> 00:17:07,044
I love the way you take care of me.

223
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:11,590
I don't want you moping
after I've left.

224
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:14,552
- I don't...
- Try and have a good time.

225
00:17:14,552 --> 00:17:17,721
- And write me every chance you get.
- I'll write every day.

226
00:17:17,972 --> 00:17:21,058
Get pink stationary and address them
to Joe, so I know it's from you.

227
00:17:24,395 --> 00:17:27,273
I want you to stay
just the way you are.

228
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:28,941
Untouched.

229
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:31,277
As I left you.

230
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:33,779
I will.

231
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:36,740
And I don't want to see
that sad little face.

232
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,617
Now give me a smile.

233
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:41,745
I'll take that with me.

234
00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:46,000
I want you to have this.
So everyone knows you belong to me.

235
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,920
Oh, God, Elvis.

236
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,597
This is it, baby.

237
00:18:03,934 --> 00:18:06,562
Come on. Come on, baby.

238
00:18:06,604 --> 00:18:09,690
Don't worry.
I'll call you as soon as I can.

239
00:18:13,277 --> 00:18:16,447
Bye, Cilla.

240
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:20,785
Elvis.

241
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,913
Elvis!

242
00:18:23,954 --> 00:18:27,041
I love you.

243
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:35,216
Has sobering Army life changed
your mind about rock 'n' roll?

244
00:18:37,301 --> 00:18:39,887
Sobering Army life?

245
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:43,057
No. I was in tanks a long time.

246
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,478
And they rock and roll quite a lot.

247
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:50,106
You break any hearts in Germany?

248
00:18:50,147 --> 00:18:53,234
No special one. There was a little gal
I was seeing quite often over there.

249
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:59,907
And there was some stories.

250
00:19:00,324 --> 00:19:03,494
"The girl he left behind."

251
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:05,955
Yeah, but no big romance.

252
00:19:05,996 --> 00:19:09,125
I got to be careful
how I answer that question.

253
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:12,294
Any plans, details
you can share with us?

254
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:14,713
I guess I got to cut some more records.

255
00:19:14,713 --> 00:19:17,842
Then I'll take a train to Miami. I'm
doing a TV special with Frank Sinatra.

256
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,096
And I'm really looking forward to that.

257
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:24,348
I guess I have one new fan.

258
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,684
As well y'all know,

259
00:19:26,725 --> 00:19:29,854
Frank was no big fan of rock 'n' roll
before I went in the Army.

260
00:19:33,232 --> 00:19:36,360
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

261
00:19:39,864 --> 00:19:42,533
Hey, man.

262
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:43,909
Ten-hut.

263
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:46,245
- How you doin'?
- Boy, I missed you guys.

264
00:19:46,287 --> 00:19:49,331
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too, Elvis.

265
00:19:49,373 --> 00:19:52,168
- How's Bill Black?
- He's selling some records.

266
00:19:52,209 --> 00:19:55,087
- Good for him. Steve, how are you?
- Good. And you?

267
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:56,964
- Real good.
- Good.

268
00:19:56,964 --> 00:20:00,134
I got these demos for you.
There are some real rockin' hits.

269
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:03,721
- I got Stuck on You...
- Skip the rockin', I ain't into that.

270
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:07,266
We're gonna do opera.

271
00:20:07,308 --> 00:20:09,560
Opera?

272
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:11,979
You're kidding, right?

273
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:14,231
[Elvis Presley: It's Now or Never]

274
00:20:14,231 --> 00:20:16,692
It's now or never

275
00:20:16,734 --> 00:20:19,820
Come hold me tight

276
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:23,949
Kiss me my darling

277
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:27,161
Be mine tonight

278
00:20:28,496 --> 00:20:31,582
Tomorrow will be too late

279
00:20:35,336 --> 00:20:38,422
It's now or never

280
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:42,259
My love won't wait

281
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:45,763
It's now or never

282
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,767
Come hold me tight

283
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:53,646
Kiss me my darling

284
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:57,775
Be mine tonight

285
00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:02,196
Tomorrow will be too late

286
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:08,702
It's now or never

287
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,706
My love won't wait

288
00:21:13,457 --> 00:21:16,585
It's now or never

289
00:21:18,462 --> 00:21:21,632
My love won't wait

290
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:28,139
It's now or never

291
00:21:28,848 --> 00:21:31,976
My love won't wait♪

292
00:21:33,144 --> 00:21:36,272
Colonel, I want to talk to you
about West Side Story.

293
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:38,774
Have a seat.

294
00:21:38,816 --> 00:21:41,777
It's a big classy film,
and they want me for the lead.

295
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:43,654
I can act the hell out of it.

296
00:21:43,654 --> 00:21:46,824
Have you seen the shooting schedule?
Six months.

297
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:49,201
We could make five films in that.

298
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:52,329
But it's a chance to do something
special, something really good.

299
00:21:52,997 --> 00:21:56,167
Elvis, let me give you a lesson
in economics.

300
00:21:58,085 --> 00:22:01,005
G.I. Blues. Your first movie back.

301
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:03,966
One of them blame musicals
you always gripe about.

302
00:22:04,008 --> 00:22:07,052
A blockbuster. Made us millions.

303
00:22:07,094 --> 00:22:10,181
Your second movie.

304
00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:12,600
Flaming Star.

305
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:15,019
An ambitious drama. Well reviewed.

306
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:18,189
Made zilch. What does that tell you?

307
00:22:19,106 --> 00:22:21,984
Why don't you tell me?
You're chomping at the bit.

308
00:22:22,026 --> 00:22:24,320
Folks live sad lives.

309
00:22:24,361 --> 00:22:27,448
Your job is to give them 90 minutes
to forget their pitiful circumstances,

310
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:31,869
not rub their faces
in some phoney, righteous misery.

311
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:35,623
What they want to see is some paradise
that they can never afford to visit,

312
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:41,629
lots of pretty girls and Elvis Presley
fighting and singing a half-dozen songs

313
00:22:44,715 --> 00:22:47,802
that we can stick on a soundtrack album.

314
00:22:47,968 --> 00:22:50,346
That's our bread and butter, son.

315
00:22:50,387 --> 00:22:52,598
You stick with what sells.

316
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,726
You don't see the snow-cone man
switch from cherry juice to prune juice

317
00:22:56,977 --> 00:23:00,064
just because he's got some blockage
in the poop chute.

318
00:23:00,481 --> 00:23:03,651
Didn't everything work out like I said?

319
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:06,028
While you were away playing soldier?

320
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,156
Hasn't everything worked out
exactly like I said it would?

321
00:23:10,741 --> 00:23:12,493
Yes, sir.

322
00:23:12,493 --> 00:23:14,286
OK.

323
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:17,414
You are the money maker,
I am the money finder.

324
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:20,584
Let's do our jobs.

325
00:23:20,584 --> 00:23:23,754
Yes, sir.

326
00:23:51,949 --> 00:23:55,035
I take your bags.

327
00:23:55,703 --> 00:23:58,789
I got another shot. I got another shot.
What you got on me here, Red, man?

328
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:04,295
- Twenty bucks you choke.
- Twenty bucks I choke you.

329
00:24:07,882 --> 00:24:10,968
There she is. It's Priscilla.

330
00:24:11,635 --> 00:24:14,722
Oh, baby. It's about time.
Where you been all my life?

331
00:24:15,723 --> 00:24:18,100
I've been missing you.

332
00:24:18,142 --> 00:24:20,811
- Let me take a look at you.
- You like?

333
00:24:20,811 --> 00:24:23,981
I do, baby, you look beautiful.
You look so grown up, baby.

334
00:24:24,815 --> 00:24:26,275
You look so beautiful.

335
00:24:26,317 --> 00:24:28,736
Everybody, this is Priscilla.

336
00:24:28,736 --> 00:24:31,489
I haven't seen her in two years.
This is Gene.

337
00:24:31,489 --> 00:24:33,949
What a girl, she sure is one pretty.

338
00:24:33,991 --> 00:24:37,077
Smith, away you stay.

339
00:24:38,662 --> 00:24:41,749
God, I missed you so much.

340
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:45,002
I couldn't get you off my mind.

341
00:24:46,754 --> 00:24:49,840
- Did you wait for me?
- I told you I would.

342
00:24:51,175 --> 00:24:54,261
That means a lot to me.

343
00:25:09,026 --> 00:25:11,570
Wait.

344
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:13,072
Wait, baby.

345
00:25:13,114 --> 00:25:16,200
- This is getting out of control.
- Don't you want me?

346
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,620
Yes. But not yet.

347
00:25:20,204 --> 00:25:22,498
I don't want to spoil you.

348
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,626
It's got to be the right time
and the right place.

349
00:25:30,214 --> 00:25:33,384
- Time to go.
- What?

350
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:36,345
I told your daddy
we'd do this thing proper.

351
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:39,390
Otherwise he'd make you go home.

352
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,600
You're staying at the Barrises'.

353
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:44,728
They're good people.

354
00:25:47,731 --> 00:25:50,818
How would you like to go to Vegas
with me tomorrow?

355
00:25:52,153 --> 00:25:55,239
We could head out about midnight,
sleep all day, then hit the shows.

356
00:25:57,491 --> 00:25:59,660
Smith.

357
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,830
- So, what did you think of the song?
- I liked it. It's really sweet.

358
00:26:03,581 --> 00:26:06,250
I prefer the fast songs,
like Jail house Rock.

359
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,461
Why don't you do more songs like that?

360
00:26:08,502 --> 00:26:11,589
I didn't ask you to tell me how to sing!
I just asked you if you liked it!

361
00:26:12,673 --> 00:26:15,760
I get enough amateur opinions.
I don't need one from you.

362
00:26:20,014 --> 00:26:23,100
I'm sorry, Satinin', come here.
Come here.

363
00:26:23,851 --> 00:26:27,021
Come on.

364
00:26:28,105 --> 00:26:31,275
I'm sorry. I just finished
that recording session,

365
00:26:31,275 --> 00:26:33,652
and I'm real proud of it, that's all.

366
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:36,781
That was better than the hogwash
they give me to sing in them movies.

367
00:26:37,615 --> 00:26:40,493
Stupid movies. Stupid songs.

368
00:26:40,534 --> 00:26:43,621
Each one makes more money than the last,
so I don't even get to tour.

369
00:26:45,122 --> 00:26:48,083
I'm sorry.

370
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:50,419
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

371
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:53,547
When we get to Vegas I'm going to get
you the best dresses money can buy.

372
00:26:59,386 --> 00:27:02,473
Lamar. Red.

373
00:27:02,556 --> 00:27:05,643
Charlie. Gene. Joe.

374
00:27:07,978 --> 00:27:11,065
- Pretty slicky.
- Not bad, Elvis.

375
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,651
Won't it be strange,
being dressed alike?

376
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:16,821
Hell no.
You all look like an organization.

377
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:22,493
All right, go and get dressed.

378
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:28,916
Now, come on, now, guys. Go on.

379
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:32,503
Gene, I said get going.

380
00:27:34,588 --> 00:27:37,675
You make that dress
look like a million bucks. Turn around.

381
00:27:38,175 --> 00:27:41,345
Charlie, get tickets for Red Skelton.

382
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:44,598
See if you can get someone
to do Cilla's hair and makeup for her.

383
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:47,476
What's wrong with my hair and makeup?

384
00:27:47,518 --> 00:27:50,604
There ain't nothing wrong with it.
This here's Vegas.

385
00:27:51,021 --> 00:27:54,191
You just need more makeup on your eyes,
make 'em stand out.

386
00:27:54,442 --> 00:27:57,611
I don't want you looking plain.
And I like makeup.

387
00:28:05,703 --> 00:28:08,789
You look amazing, baby.

388
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:18,424
Why do you always have the TV on?

389
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:21,552
...that resulted in new pledges to
China by the United States.

390
00:28:22,136 --> 00:28:23,971
It keeps me company.

391
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:26,432
...Mr. Eisenhower made to Taiwan...

392
00:28:26,474 --> 00:28:28,726
But I'm here.

393
00:28:28,726 --> 00:28:30,811
...provides shelter for his host.

394
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:33,981
A warm, candid vignette
of two world figures in a friendly...

395
00:28:34,565 --> 00:28:35,775
Leave it on.

396
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:38,527
President Eisenhower's office
in Gettysburg

397
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:41,655
is becoming a must-stop for
distinguished visitors to the country.

398
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:45,576
Chen Cheng, Vice President
and Premier of China...

399
00:28:45,576 --> 00:28:48,746
Can you believe it, baby?

400
00:28:50,748 --> 00:28:53,834
Who'd ever thought we'd pull this off?

401
00:28:56,253 --> 00:28:59,423
I don't want it to end.

402
00:29:00,341 --> 00:29:03,427
I don't want to think about
you going away.

403
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:09,600
We'll have a good time.

404
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:14,188
We'll think about that
when the time comes.

405
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:43,467
Congratulations. You got three
of the top grossing films this year.

406
00:29:46,637 --> 00:29:49,723
See what happens when you pay attention
to the Colonel?

407
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,350
Yeah.

408
00:29:51,392 --> 00:29:54,478
But I also see that West Side Story
got ten Academy Awards.

409
00:29:54,728 --> 00:29:57,106
Try to cash one of them at the bank.

410
00:29:57,148 --> 00:29:59,400
But people remember who won, Colonel.

411
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,570
- You think people will forget you?
- If I keep making the movies I do.

412
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,240
They won't as long as I'm alive.

413
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,160
Elvis, I need to talk to you.

414
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,329
Yes, Grandma.

415
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:16,417
- It's been two days.
- She's tired. She's been sleeping.

416
00:30:17,168 --> 00:30:19,336
- For two days?
- It's OK, Daddy.

417
00:30:19,336 --> 00:30:22,089
- She's not used to the lifestyle.
- Lifestyle?

418
00:30:22,089 --> 00:30:25,259
Priscilla? Honey, it's Grandma.

419
00:30:25,676 --> 00:30:27,678
You all right?

420
00:30:27,678 --> 00:30:29,972
Priscilla, hon?

421
00:30:30,014 --> 00:30:33,100
- What'd you give that young 'un?
- We oughta call a doctor.

422
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,520
Oh, hell, no!
We're not calling any doctor.

423
00:30:36,854 --> 00:30:40,024
Look, she's comin' to.

424
00:30:40,858 --> 00:30:43,944
She's gonna be OK.

425
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:47,364
Elvis?

426
00:30:47,865 --> 00:30:50,951
- What's wrong?
- Baby, you had us scared.

427
00:30:51,786 --> 00:30:54,872
You been out for two days
on those Placidyls I gave you.

428
00:30:55,206 --> 00:30:58,375
Two days?
But that's two days off of my trip.

429
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:04,131
What's today?

430
00:31:04,131 --> 00:31:06,801
- Twenty-eighth.
- Elvis!

431
00:31:06,801 --> 00:31:08,928
I leave in three days.

432
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:12,056
Baby, we still got plenty of time.

433
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:14,475
I promise I'll make it up to you.

434
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:17,645
One huckleberry, two huckleberry,
three huckleberry.

435
00:31:17,728 --> 00:31:20,022
You know I love her.

436
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,150
Her daddy's concerned about
her being back for school.

437
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:25,903
What do I care about school?

438
00:31:25,903 --> 00:31:28,656
Why don't you put her in a school here?

439
00:31:28,656 --> 00:31:31,826
Son, she's gonna have to go back.
You had an agreement.

440
00:31:32,576 --> 00:31:35,496
- Screw the agreement!
- You know better than that.

441
00:31:35,496 --> 00:31:38,457
Presleys do not back out
on their word.

442
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:41,585
She's goin' back to Germany,
we're goin' to Graceland.

443
00:31:42,086 --> 00:31:45,172
Look out! Oh, got it, oh...

444
00:31:47,174 --> 00:31:50,344
Smith, get these folks out of here.

445
00:31:50,511 --> 00:31:53,597
Me and Priscilla want some peace
and quiet. And take Honey with you.

446
00:31:54,515 --> 00:31:57,518
Get the ball.

447
00:31:57,518 --> 00:32:00,146
A cows purple,
Cilla and me one fix.

448
00:32:00,187 --> 00:32:03,274
On that.

449
00:32:03,691 --> 00:32:06,026
What is that?

450
00:32:06,026 --> 00:32:09,196
A purple cow is vanilla ice-cream
and new grape soda. You'll like it.

451
00:32:09,947 --> 00:32:13,117
No, I mean that way you're talking.

452
00:32:14,285 --> 00:32:16,537
Well, that's our secret language.

453
00:32:16,537 --> 00:32:18,914
We've been doin' it since we were kids.

454
00:32:18,956 --> 00:32:22,042
You take the last word and put it up
first, and the first word up last.

455
00:32:23,627 --> 00:32:26,797
Like... loves Cilla Elvis.

456
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:31,969
- Kind of childish.
- Yeah?

457
00:32:32,052 --> 00:32:35,139
Why don't you try it?

458
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:39,643
Much Cilla loves Elvis very.

459
00:32:39,643 --> 00:32:42,813
Oh, that's it. Now everyone will think
we've been talkin' nonsense,

460
00:32:44,231 --> 00:32:46,734
and it'll just be our own
secret language.

461
00:32:46,734 --> 00:32:49,570
Private code. It'll be our very own.

462
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,031
A secret for our world.

463
00:32:52,072 --> 00:32:55,159
- You and me?
- Me and you.

464
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,163
Go I don't want to.

465
00:32:59,163 --> 00:33:02,333
Neither me.

466
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:05,836
Cry I want to.

467
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:23,062
What's wrong?

468
00:33:23,104 --> 00:33:26,190
I was just telling Mama how much she'd
have loved Priscilla. She would, Daddy.

469
00:33:27,691 --> 00:33:29,485
Yeah, she would.

470
00:33:29,527 --> 00:33:32,154
You gotta help me get her
back here permanent.

471
00:33:32,196 --> 00:33:34,073
Help you?

472
00:33:34,115 --> 00:33:37,201
Son, I think this here is a bad idea
all the way around.

473
00:33:38,035 --> 00:33:41,038
They buried Jerry Lee Lewis
for these shenanigans.

474
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:43,415
You gotta help me find a way, Daddy.

475
00:33:43,457 --> 00:33:46,544
It's important to me.
She's important to me.

476
00:33:47,378 --> 00:33:50,464
- Aw, hell, she's a miserable as I am.
- Yeah, I know she is.

477
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:53,717
Maybe her daddy'd go for it

478
00:33:53,717 --> 00:33:56,887
if we found a good Catholic school
for her here to finish her senior year.

479
00:33:58,305 --> 00:34:01,392
And have her stay some place other
than Graceland.

480
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:04,812
That's a great idea, Daddy.
Catholic school.

481
00:34:05,146 --> 00:34:08,315
Oh, man, I love them uniforms.

482
00:34:10,651 --> 00:34:13,821
Wake up, Elvis. I'm home from school.

483
00:34:16,323 --> 00:34:18,284
I got 'em making you breakfast.

484
00:34:18,325 --> 00:34:21,203
Orange juice, home fries,
a pound of bacon, burnt,

485
00:34:21,245 --> 00:34:24,331
and a Spanish omelet. Right?

486
00:34:24,498 --> 00:34:27,585
Coffee. Coffee first.

487
00:34:30,087 --> 00:34:33,090
Honey, do you really need
all these pills?

488
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,260
Placidyls, Seconals, Guinals,
Dexedrines, Quaaludes.

489
00:34:40,347 --> 00:34:42,433
I know what I'm doin'.

490
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:45,436
Here.

491
00:34:45,436 --> 00:34:48,606
This here explains
everything that I take.

492
00:34:49,273 --> 00:34:52,359
Ingredients, side effects, everything.

493
00:34:54,278 --> 00:34:56,655
Ain't nothin' I don't know about 'em.

494
00:34:56,697 --> 00:34:58,908
And I'm not dependin' on 'em.

495
00:34:58,949 --> 00:35:01,702
I use 'em like a doctor does.

496
00:35:01,702 --> 00:35:04,872
You could use a few Dexies.
Help you lose some weight.

497
00:35:05,873 --> 00:35:08,959
And don't slump.
And don't wrinkle your forehead.

498
00:35:09,293 --> 00:35:12,379
That's a bad habit too.

499
00:35:14,215 --> 00:35:16,425
- How's school, darlin'?
- It's good.

500
00:35:16,467 --> 00:35:19,553
I need money for books. Getting a dollar
out of your daddy is like pulling teeth.

501
00:35:21,388 --> 00:35:24,433
That's Daddy. He's pretty tight.

502
00:35:24,475 --> 00:35:26,977
That's why I have him pay my bills.

503
00:35:26,977 --> 00:35:30,147
I don't trust anybody else.

504
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:35,569
You gotta understand,
Daddy came up hard.

505
00:35:36,153 --> 00:35:39,323
But I'll talk to him
about giving you an allowance.

506
00:35:42,326 --> 00:35:45,412
I've gotta go to LA
to do this movie, Satinin'.

507
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:51,293
Who's in it with you?

508
00:35:51,335 --> 00:35:54,422
Now don't be getting jealous.
It's just another Hollywood starlet.

509
00:35:55,548 --> 00:35:57,883
Redhead, this time.

510
00:35:57,883 --> 00:36:01,011
She was in that movie that made fun
of me going into the Army.

511
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,265
Bye Bye Birdie.

512
00:36:04,265 --> 00:36:07,435
- What's her name?
- Ann-Margret.

513
00:36:10,438 --> 00:36:12,606
And foot. And foot.

514
00:36:12,606 --> 00:36:15,776
That's it. Now turn her in.

515
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:21,866
That's great. Great.

516
00:36:21,866 --> 00:36:24,994
It'll be fabulous. Get some lunch.

517
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,290
- That sure was fun.
- Sure as hell was.

518
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,877
- You can move, baby.
- You can sing, baby.

519
00:36:42,303 --> 00:36:45,389
This is one movie I might enjoy makin'.

520
00:36:46,098 --> 00:36:49,226
She's like a female you.

521
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:53,647
Now Odetta's Tomorrow Is a Long Time
is a great song.

522
00:36:55,149 --> 00:36:58,235
- You should record that.
- We tried but couldn't get the rights.

523
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,989
Elvis Presley? Why not?

524
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:05,117
They wouldn't accept the Colonel's deal.
Every song I record,

525
00:37:06,243 --> 00:37:09,330
the songwriter's gotta give up
50 percent of his royalties.

526
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:12,833
- Colonel does a good job, doesn't he?
- No, that's outrageous!

527
00:37:14,835 --> 00:37:16,670
Why?

528
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,840
- We give them a big hit all the time.
- You don't make enough money,

529
00:37:20,424 --> 00:37:22,718
You have to go rob some poor songwriter?

530
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,679
No wonder you have no decent songs
for your films.

531
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:28,849
Oh, come on, Rusty,
why you being so hard on me?

532
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:32,937
I'm hard on you
because someone has to be.

533
00:37:33,437 --> 00:37:36,607
Elvis, you are a great singer.

534
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:40,069
You deserve great songs.

535
00:37:44,198 --> 00:37:46,158
For me?

536
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,286
- What's the occasion?
- You and me together.

537
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:52,706
Isn't that enough of an occasion?

538
00:37:52,832 --> 00:37:55,960
Oh, yes, it is.

539
00:37:56,877 --> 00:37:59,630
Open it.

540
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:02,758
All right.

541
00:38:07,888 --> 00:38:10,975
- Bob Dylan.
- Yeah.

542
00:38:11,058 --> 00:38:14,145
- You know who that is, right?
- Of course.

543
00:38:15,479 --> 00:38:18,441
See, maybe if you change your contract,

544
00:38:18,482 --> 00:38:21,569
you could record some of this new stuff.

545
00:38:22,153 --> 00:38:25,239
- You know, maybe like the Beatles.
- I don't wanna hear about them.

546
00:38:29,577 --> 00:38:32,413
ls baby jealous?

547
00:38:32,455 --> 00:38:34,790
I hear they treat their fans like crap.

548
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,251
You think they should be treated
with love.

549
00:38:37,251 --> 00:38:40,421
- That's right.
- Well, baby,

550
00:38:41,046 --> 00:38:44,175
I think you should show me
some of that love.

551
00:38:44,258 --> 00:38:47,428
Cos I'm your biggest fan.

552
00:38:54,894 --> 00:38:58,022
Elvis! What prompts this rare pleasure?

553
00:38:58,522 --> 00:39:01,650
I have Ann-Margret outside.
I want you to manage her.

554
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:05,988
Well...

555
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:09,116
...she's a wonderful talent. I could
certainly do something with her.

556
00:39:10,868 --> 00:39:14,038
Of course, it'd take some time,
some work.

557
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:17,208
But I think I could do it
without neglecting your career.

558
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:21,420
- Neglect?
- Certainly.

559
00:39:21,462 --> 00:39:24,590
I'd have to donate half my time to her.
At least at the start of things.

560
00:39:26,425 --> 00:39:28,010
That much?

561
00:39:28,052 --> 00:39:31,138
To do her justice, yeah.

562
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,726
Look, son,
you know where my loyalties lie.

563
00:39:38,479 --> 00:39:41,649
I was just talking to the director
of this here masterpiece.

564
00:39:41,982 --> 00:39:44,902
Have you seen how much
he's putting her in the film?

565
00:39:44,944 --> 00:39:48,072
All them close-ups of her?
He's in love with the girl, I swear.

566
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:53,285
Don't he understand that this
is an Elvis Presley picture

567
00:39:53,577 --> 00:39:56,747
and that all that extra shooting
puts us over schedule,

568
00:39:56,831 --> 00:39:59,917
which means over budget? That's
stealin' money out of our pockets.

569
00:40:00,668 --> 00:40:03,587
- I'm not worried about money.
- You shouldn't be.

570
00:40:03,587 --> 00:40:05,798
That's not your job, it's mine.

571
00:40:05,798 --> 00:40:08,926
How deep are you in
with this showgirl, Elvis?

572
00:40:10,594 --> 00:40:13,389
That's a personal question, I know,

573
00:40:13,431 --> 00:40:16,517
but you crossed the line
when you asked me to represent her.

574
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:20,438
Do you love her?

575
00:40:20,646 --> 00:40:23,774
I like her. A lot.

576
00:40:24,024 --> 00:40:26,610
Well, don't you have
some responsibilities

577
00:40:26,652 --> 00:40:29,530
in Memphis you're forgetting?

578
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:32,700
You made some commitments there,
and I know you to be a man of your word.

579
00:40:33,951 --> 00:40:37,079
I am. I am.

580
00:40:38,205 --> 00:40:40,458
How would it look?

581
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:43,586
You toss aside this 16-year-old child
that you have moved into your home

582
00:40:46,172 --> 00:40:49,216
with promises of marriage?

583
00:40:49,216 --> 00:40:52,386
Could raise a mighty stink.
Maybe threaten your career.

584
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:55,973
She's not 16, she's 17 now.

585
00:40:56,307 --> 00:40:58,768
Yeah.

586
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:01,604
I have to get back to set.

587
00:41:01,645 --> 00:41:04,190
Elvis.

588
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,942
This Ann-Margret representation idea.

589
00:41:06,984 --> 00:41:10,070
Think long and hard if it's something
you want me to do.

590
00:41:10,237 --> 00:41:13,407
Oh, just forget about it.

591
00:41:34,762 --> 00:41:37,848
I never thought I'd get
too serious with an actress.

592
00:41:38,766 --> 00:41:41,852
They're always into their own careers.

593
00:41:41,852 --> 00:41:44,939
And their men always come second.

594
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:48,109
I couldn't be second place to anybody
or anything.

595
00:41:50,027 --> 00:41:53,114
Maybe you just haven't found
a woman who can handle both.

596
00:42:00,371 --> 00:42:03,541
Baby, don't I make you feel
like you're number one?

597
00:42:06,544 --> 00:42:09,630
That you do, Rusty. That you do.

598
00:42:11,549 --> 00:42:14,468
Tell me,

599
00:42:14,468 --> 00:42:17,430
how far you ever gone
on a motorcycle?

600
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:20,558
Gentlemen, start your engines.

601
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:33,070
I really wanna see you.

602
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:36,198
Now's not the time to come out.
There's a problem on the movie.

603
00:42:36,657 --> 00:42:39,743
- What kind of problem?
- All hell's broken loose.

604
00:42:40,077 --> 00:42:42,913
This crazy director's in love
with Ann-Margret.

605
00:42:42,955 --> 00:42:46,083
He's given her all these close-ups
and wants her to sing with me.

606
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:48,335
You'd think it was her movie.

607
00:42:48,335 --> 00:42:51,213
The Colonel almost crapped
cubes of blue marble.

608
00:42:51,255 --> 00:42:53,507
How are you and her getting along?

609
00:42:53,507 --> 00:42:56,677
She's OK. Typical Hollywood starlet.

610
00:42:57,678 --> 00:42:59,889
I've been reading about you and her.

611
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:02,516
I told you about reading
those gossip rags.

612
00:43:02,516 --> 00:43:05,102
- ls there anything to it?
- Hell, no.

613
00:43:05,144 --> 00:43:07,021
I wanna come out there now.

614
00:43:07,021 --> 00:43:10,191
No, not now. We're wrapping soon.
I'll be home in about two weeks.

615
00:43:13,194 --> 00:43:16,322
You just keep your cute little ass there
and keep the home fires burnin'.

616
00:43:17,364 --> 00:43:20,493
The flame is burning on low. Someone
better come on home and light the pilot.

617
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,248
You're beginning to sound like me.
I better watch it.

618
00:43:26,749 --> 00:43:29,877
Look, I'll be home soon.
You get everything ready, OK?

619
00:43:31,295 --> 00:43:34,465
Bye.

620
00:43:50,231 --> 00:43:52,983
That is an outrageous lie!

621
00:43:52,983 --> 00:43:55,361
I can't believe she'd say that!

622
00:43:55,402 --> 00:43:58,489
- So it's true.
- No. We're not engaged.

623
00:43:59,865 --> 00:44:02,993
But you're seeing her.
Those gossip rags were true.

624
00:44:04,245 --> 00:44:07,331
Why doesn't she take her ass
back to Sweden where she belongs?

625
00:44:10,042 --> 00:44:12,044
Look, damn it!

626
00:44:12,086 --> 00:44:14,797
I didn't know things
were gonna get out of hand.

627
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:17,925
I want a woman who's gonna understand
that things like this might happen.

628
00:44:19,009 --> 00:44:22,096
Are you gonna be that woman or not?

629
00:44:22,513 --> 00:44:24,765
It's over, Cilla.

630
00:44:24,765 --> 00:44:27,935
I swear to you, it's over.

631
00:44:29,061 --> 00:44:31,105
Forgive me.

632
00:44:31,147 --> 00:44:34,275
Please?

633
00:44:40,614 --> 00:44:43,701
I'll go to LA,
get this thing straightened out.

634
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:50,958
Mrs Kennedy, Caroline,
Little John-John,

635
00:44:52,376 --> 00:44:55,546
saluting the President's casket.

636
00:44:56,297 --> 00:44:59,467
The caissons, followed by
a black-jacketed riderless horse.

637
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:06,098
A pair of boots strapped backwards
in the stirrups

638
00:45:07,558 --> 00:45:10,019
signifies a fallen leader...

639
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,062
Elvis.

640
00:45:12,062 --> 00:45:14,315
I heard the news in London.

641
00:45:14,315 --> 00:45:17,485
It's so sad.

642
00:45:25,493 --> 00:45:28,579
You have to know, I didn't tell
those reporters anything.

643
00:45:31,415 --> 00:45:34,585
I didn't. I don't know
where they got the story.

644
00:45:37,588 --> 00:45:40,758
That bastard Colonel Parker set me up.

645
00:45:43,928 --> 00:45:47,014
It'd never have worked anyway.

646
00:45:47,431 --> 00:45:50,518
You have your career, and I got mine.

647
00:45:50,684 --> 00:45:53,854
I have commitments.

648
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,296
It was December 1956 when one artist had
nine concurrent hits in the top 100.

649
00:46:20,631 --> 00:46:22,842
That artist was Elvis Presley.

650
00:46:22,883 --> 00:46:25,970
His record was shattered this week
as the Beatles find themselves

651
00:46:26,804 --> 00:46:29,890
with 14 hits in the top 100 and
Can't Buy Me Love at number one.

652
00:46:30,224 --> 00:46:33,394
And here it is, Can't Buy Me...

653
00:46:34,228 --> 00:46:37,314
Thanks. Oh, Red, go put that up.

654
00:46:38,566 --> 00:46:40,359
You guys read that jive?

655
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:42,903
Hal Wallis says
he only puts me in pictures

656
00:46:42,903 --> 00:46:46,073
so he can afford to make classy movies,
with Peter O'Toole and Richard Burton.

657
00:46:47,408 --> 00:46:50,494
Double-dealing son of a bitch.
And the Colonel ain't no better.

658
00:46:51,162 --> 00:46:53,789
Why don't they put me
in a classy production?

659
00:46:53,831 --> 00:46:56,917
Those bastards are riding my career to
hell in a hand basket. Come on, Joe.

660
00:47:00,087 --> 00:47:03,257
Red, I'd move if I were you.

661
00:47:08,345 --> 00:47:11,432
- Where's Cilla?
- She's gettin' her hair done.

662
00:47:12,683 --> 00:47:14,810
I'm bored out of my gourd.

663
00:47:14,852 --> 00:47:17,938
Come on, let's go shopping.
Come on, Red.

664
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:24,403
I'll take this and let each fella
pick what he wants.

665
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:27,198
- Whatever you say.
- You don't have to do that, E.

666
00:47:27,198 --> 00:47:30,201
Maybe we can get some burgers.
Your daddy told me...

667
00:47:30,201 --> 00:47:32,745
- You tryin' to tell me what to do?
- No, E...

668
00:47:32,787 --> 00:47:35,873
Then shut up. Go get yourself
some wheels, damn it.

669
00:47:37,124 --> 00:47:38,501
Now.

670
00:47:38,542 --> 00:47:39,960
We got 'em all...

671
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,046
Vernon's gonna be mad.

672
00:47:42,046 --> 00:47:45,216
Lamar, this has big enough seats
even you could make out in the back.

673
00:47:47,301 --> 00:47:49,929
How do you do, ma'am.
My name's Elvis Presley.

674
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:52,640
Oh, I know that! I'm Katie Day.

675
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,810
How do you do, Katie Day?

676
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:58,813
- Are you looking to buy a Caddy?
- In my dreams.

677
00:47:58,813 --> 00:48:00,981
No, I'm just window shopping.

678
00:48:00,981 --> 00:48:04,110
I used to do the same
when all I had was dreams.

679
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:07,238
Howard, I want you to take a pink
ribbon, put it around that car

680
00:48:07,655 --> 00:48:09,740
and hand the keys to Katie Day here.

681
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:12,910
What? Oh!

682
00:48:13,661 --> 00:48:16,622
- Thank you.
- Drive safely now.

683
00:48:16,664 --> 00:48:18,541
- Take care now.
- I will.

684
00:48:18,582 --> 00:48:21,460
- God bless you, baby.
- Oh, no, God bless you.

685
00:48:21,502 --> 00:48:24,588
God bless you, Elvis!

686
00:48:25,005 --> 00:48:27,800
Do you know how much money
you spent last month?

687
00:48:27,842 --> 00:48:30,177
Over $500,000.

688
00:48:30,177 --> 00:48:32,430
And more the month before.

689
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:35,516
You're gonna break us,
put us in the poorhouse.

690
00:48:35,516 --> 00:48:38,686
- I can always earn more money.
- Why can't you just stop buying stuff?

691
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:43,107
Cos I like the look on folk's faces
when I buy 'em somethin', Daddy.

692
00:48:44,942 --> 00:48:47,278
You remember when we were dirt poor.

693
00:48:47,278 --> 00:48:50,448
How nice it would've been
if someone bought me a car.

694
00:48:50,698 --> 00:48:53,075
I ain't sayin'
that it ain't a nice thing,

695
00:48:53,117 --> 00:48:56,203
but you keep this up, and we're gonna be
livin' in a Tupelo shotgun shack again.

696
00:49:00,124 --> 00:49:03,210
Elvis?

697
00:49:05,379 --> 00:49:08,466
I gotta take a nap, Daddy.

698
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:11,385
Where are my sleeping pills?

699
00:49:11,385 --> 00:49:14,555
You're nodding off already.
Do you need 'em?

700
00:49:20,561 --> 00:49:22,313
- Nice shot.
- Yeah!

701
00:49:22,313 --> 00:49:25,483
- Gene, honey, I wanna go home.
- When we're finished.

702
00:49:26,901 --> 00:49:30,070
- Gene...
- Damn it! Turn that crap off!

703
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:34,033
I'm sick of this English Invasion jive.

704
00:49:34,074 --> 00:49:37,161
Why don't you listen to the originals?
Like Muddy Waters?

705
00:49:37,745 --> 00:49:39,955
Now there was a singer.

706
00:49:39,997 --> 00:49:43,084
The hell with these Beetle Bugs
or Rolling Rocks. English critters!

707
00:49:46,253 --> 00:49:48,923
Don't mind him,
it's just the pills talkin'.

708
00:49:48,923 --> 00:49:52,093
That's OK, I'd be mad too if those
English guys put me out of business.

709
00:49:52,843 --> 00:49:55,304
When was the last time
you had a hit, Elvis?

710
00:49:55,346 --> 00:49:58,349
Nobody talks to me like that, you bitch!

711
00:49:58,349 --> 00:50:01,519
- What the hell are you doin'?!
- Oh, God!

712
00:50:03,938 --> 00:50:07,108
I think you broke her ankle, E.

713
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,113
Get her the best doctor you can find.

714
00:50:12,113 --> 00:50:14,990
And buy her a car. A Cadillac, T-Bird.

715
00:50:15,032 --> 00:50:17,326
Whatever you say, E.

716
00:50:17,368 --> 00:50:19,662
Find my anti-depressants, Charlie.

717
00:50:19,703 --> 00:50:22,790
I've been lookin' everywhere,
and I can't find 'em.

718
00:50:25,042 --> 00:50:28,212
- None of you bastards hid 'em, did you?
- I'll see if I can find them.

719
00:50:45,062 --> 00:50:48,232
- I'm worried about you, Son.
- Why?

720
00:50:49,066 --> 00:50:52,153
What are you looking at me
like that for? I got a zit?

721
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:53,946
It's the pills, E.

722
00:50:53,988 --> 00:50:57,074
We're concerned about your health.

723
00:50:57,324 --> 00:50:59,535
I know what I'm doin'.

724
00:50:59,577 --> 00:51:02,663
- I'm just tryin' to help you, Son.
- I don't need no advice from you.

725
00:51:04,165 --> 00:51:06,584
You work for me, that's it. Understand?

726
00:51:06,584 --> 00:51:09,754
- I'm your daddy.
- And I'm of age, old man.

727
00:51:09,754 --> 00:51:12,923
I don't need a daddy anymore.

728
00:51:27,021 --> 00:51:29,940
- So, Larry, what are you into?
- What do you mean?

729
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,610
You know, man,
what rocks your boat?

730
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:35,780
Like me, I'm into... Aw, hell, I don't
even know what I'm into anymore.

731
00:51:38,449 --> 00:51:41,535
Music, obviously.

732
00:51:41,619 --> 00:51:44,538
Karate. I picked that up in the Army.

733
00:51:44,538 --> 00:51:47,708
Yep, I like karate.
You?

734
00:51:48,626 --> 00:51:51,712
Jeez, let me see.
Well, I'm into hair, obviously.

735
00:51:55,049 --> 00:51:58,135
But, you know, last few years I've been
thinking about the big questions,

736
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,807
like where do we come from?

737
00:52:02,807 --> 00:52:05,976
Why are we here? Where are we going?

738
00:52:06,143 --> 00:52:09,313
Oh, man, just keep talkin', man.
Keep talkin'.

739
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:13,150
- What do you mean three hours?
- Just like I said.

740
00:52:13,818 --> 00:52:16,237
For a trim?

741
00:52:16,237 --> 00:52:19,406
I swear to God, man,

742
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,827
no one knows how empty I feel.

743
00:52:24,245 --> 00:52:27,415
I mean, no one knows anythin' about me,
man, least of all me.

744
00:52:30,501 --> 00:52:33,671
And what is this emptiness?

745
00:52:35,506 --> 00:52:38,509
I have no right to feel this way.

746
00:52:38,509 --> 00:52:41,178
- What do you want?
- E, are you OK in there?

747
00:52:41,178 --> 00:52:44,348
- Everything's fine.
- You've been in there four hours, man.

748
00:52:44,932 --> 00:52:48,102
I said everything's fine, damn it!
Leave us alone!

749
00:52:49,019 --> 00:52:52,106
- He shoots...
- That's it. Go, baby, go, go, go, go!

750
00:52:53,274 --> 00:52:54,942
He's got it!

751
00:52:54,942 --> 00:52:58,112
- He's gone, he's gone.
- Twenty, 15, ten...

752
00:52:58,195 --> 00:53:00,990
- Elvis, what are you doin'?
- Listen to this.

753
00:53:01,031 --> 00:53:03,242
This is how God works.

754
00:53:03,284 --> 00:53:06,370
"I may be expressin' through you
beautiful symphonies of sound,

755
00:53:06,954 --> 00:53:10,124
color and language,
that manifests itself as music.

756
00:53:11,459 --> 00:53:14,545
And which so affect others
as to cause them to acclaim you

757
00:53:14,962 --> 00:53:17,548
as one of the great ones of the day

758
00:53:17,548 --> 00:53:20,718
and hail you as a wonderful preacher
and teacher."

759
00:53:22,136 --> 00:53:23,846
Huh?

760
00:53:23,888 --> 00:53:25,639
Don't you get it?

761
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:28,809
Ever since Mama died, I been trying
to figure these things out.

762
00:53:29,393 --> 00:53:31,854
Why God took her away from me.

763
00:53:31,896 --> 00:53:34,440
Why He gave me this success and fame.

764
00:53:34,482 --> 00:53:37,568
Why out of all of the millions,
He picked me to be Elvis Presley.

765
00:53:39,069 --> 00:53:41,614
These books are explaining things to me.

766
00:53:41,655 --> 00:53:44,158
Why is there so much suffering
in the world?

767
00:53:44,158 --> 00:53:46,827
Why am I not happy
when he gave me all this?

768
00:53:46,827 --> 00:53:49,080
Don't we make you happy?

769
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,249
No, Lamar, you don't. None of this does,
that's the whole point.

770
00:53:53,667 --> 00:53:55,377
You gotta read these books.

771
00:53:55,419 --> 00:53:58,380
If it don't have Batman in it,
it ain't in my library.

772
00:53:58,422 --> 00:54:00,966
- Or naked women.
- Amen.

773
00:54:01,008 --> 00:54:04,095
Oh, the hell with the lot of you.

774
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:11,018
Cilla?

775
00:54:11,018 --> 00:54:14,188
Wake up, wake up,
I wanna read you somethin'.

776
00:54:14,605 --> 00:54:17,691
Oh, Baby, it's 2am.

777
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,446
All right, Larry.
I just want the damn truth, man.

778
00:54:23,697 --> 00:54:26,784
I mean...
What the hell am I doin' wrong?

779
00:54:29,453 --> 00:54:31,872
- Or maybe God doesn't love me.
- Come on!

780
00:54:31,872 --> 00:54:35,042
Hey, you shut up or get out of the car!

781
00:54:37,378 --> 00:54:39,672
All I wanna know is the truth.

782
00:54:39,713 --> 00:54:42,716
To know and experience God.

783
00:54:42,716 --> 00:54:45,886
But ever since we started,
I haven't had one experience.

784
00:54:46,637 --> 00:54:49,515
Nothing. And I believe, man.

785
00:54:49,557 --> 00:54:52,643
I really do believe. And I want it,
Larry. I want it so bad, man.

786
00:54:55,146 --> 00:54:57,231
What the hell is wrong with me?

787
00:54:57,231 --> 00:55:00,401
It isn't a prize, Elvis.
It's not something one earns.

788
00:55:02,403 --> 00:55:05,573
Nobody knows when that moment
of revelation might come.

789
00:55:06,824 --> 00:55:09,994
It could take your whole life.
For some, it never happens.

790
00:55:15,082 --> 00:55:18,252
ls this thing gonna work or not?
We're runnin' out of highway.

791
00:55:18,669 --> 00:55:21,756
That's funny.
It'll be up in just one sec.

792
00:55:22,089 --> 00:55:25,176
Can we start that playback, please?

793
00:55:25,426 --> 00:55:28,387
Cut! Cut!
Sorry about this.

794
00:55:28,429 --> 00:55:31,515
Just get the damn thing workin',
will ya?

795
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:38,856
Man, that bites, huh?

796
00:55:41,192 --> 00:55:44,361
Go on, guys.

797
00:55:48,616 --> 00:55:50,034
What?

798
00:55:50,034 --> 00:55:52,703
You're startin' to look
like a kettle of crap.

799
00:55:52,703 --> 00:55:55,831
- That's none of your business.
- But it is my business.

800
00:55:55,873 --> 00:55:58,959
No one's gonna pay
to see a burned-out Elvis.

801
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:02,296
Now, you've been late to the set.
More than once.

802
00:56:03,047 --> 00:56:05,257
That's not like you at all.

803
00:56:05,299 --> 00:56:07,593
Have you even read this piece of crap?

804
00:56:07,635 --> 00:56:10,179
Do you know the lines I gotta say?

805
00:56:10,221 --> 00:56:12,640
You wouldn't hurry up
to get here either.

806
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,683
It's not professional, son.

807
00:56:14,725 --> 00:56:17,436
You signed on to do this,
you owe them your best.

808
00:56:17,478 --> 00:56:20,564
I signed on to do this movie
cos you told me to.

809
00:56:20,815 --> 00:56:23,484
- I need the money.
- You do.

810
00:56:23,484 --> 00:56:26,654
You spend like a drunken sailor.
Now, that's none of my business,

811
00:56:27,321 --> 00:56:30,407
but you show up on time, say the lines,
stupid or not, that is my business.

812
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:36,330
Yes, sir.

813
00:56:37,915 --> 00:56:41,085
Now what's this about
some religious kick you're on?

814
00:56:45,589 --> 00:56:47,800
How dare that son of a bitch?

815
00:56:47,842 --> 00:56:50,469
He doesn't know the first thing
about my life.

816
00:56:50,511 --> 00:56:53,597
It's not a kick, it's my life.
It's real.

817
00:56:54,181 --> 00:56:57,351
And what happens in this house
is my own private business.

818
00:56:57,685 --> 00:57:00,771
It's none of the Colonel's affair
or anybody else's.

819
00:57:01,772 --> 00:57:04,942
My God, if I ever catch the traitor
in my own house!

820
00:57:05,109 --> 00:57:08,154
- What are you looking for?
- My Dexies.

821
00:57:08,195 --> 00:57:10,781
He's bitchin'
because he thinks I look beat.

822
00:57:10,781 --> 00:57:13,951
- Where are they?
- You've already had a fistful...

823
00:57:14,535 --> 00:57:17,621
Maybe they're in the can.

824
00:57:21,292 --> 00:57:22,918
Elvis?

825
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,046
Honey. Honey, you're OK.

826
00:57:27,214 --> 00:57:30,301
No, you don't wanna look at that, honey.
Come on. Vernon!

827
00:57:32,052 --> 00:57:35,222
What's the matter with you boys?
What do you think your job is?

828
00:57:36,223 --> 00:57:38,934
Someone has to be with him
24 hours a day.

829
00:57:38,976 --> 00:57:42,062
I don't care if you have to go
into the donica with him.

830
00:57:42,229 --> 00:57:45,399
Look at him. If they have to stop
the film because of this,

831
00:57:45,816 --> 00:57:48,986
it's gonna fall on you boys' heads.

832
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:52,656
There's going to be some changes
around here.

833
00:57:53,073 --> 00:57:56,160
First, all them religion books

834
00:57:57,328 --> 00:58:00,164
is to be carted out of here and burned.

835
00:58:00,164 --> 00:58:03,334
Some of you think
that maybe Elvis is Jesus Christ,

836
00:58:04,001 --> 00:58:07,088
that he should wear robes and walk down
the street, saving the world.

837
00:58:08,422 --> 00:58:11,592
- But that's not who he is.
- He's not trying to save the world.

838
00:58:12,593 --> 00:58:15,471
He's trying to save himself.

839
00:58:15,513 --> 00:58:18,599
Second, from now on,
everything goes through Joe,

840
00:58:20,017 --> 00:58:23,187
who will be present
at all hair-cutting sessions,

841
00:58:23,187 --> 00:58:26,357
which will be limited to one half-hour.

842
00:58:26,941 --> 00:58:29,902
Elvis needs to concentrate on his work.

843
00:58:29,944 --> 00:58:32,446
I don't want him reading any more books

844
00:58:32,446 --> 00:58:35,616
or involved in things
that clutter up his mind.

845
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:41,288
We've gotta take care of business.

846
00:58:41,705 --> 00:58:44,792
Now get the hell out of here.

847
00:59:10,651 --> 00:59:13,821
Why are you doing this to yourself?
This religious kick, the drugs?

848
00:59:16,323 --> 00:59:19,410
What is it you want?

849
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:22,663
You said that to me
the first time we met.

850
00:59:22,663 --> 00:59:24,707
I remember.

851
00:59:24,749 --> 00:59:27,835
Rich and famous.
You wanted to be a movie star.

852
00:59:28,753 --> 00:59:31,839
Well, I got it for you,
so I'm asking you again.

853
00:59:33,257 --> 00:59:36,343
What is it you want now?

854
00:59:37,845 --> 00:59:40,639
I don't know.

855
00:59:40,681 --> 00:59:43,768
Are you just bored, is that it?

856
00:59:44,101 --> 00:59:47,271
There's that.

857
00:59:47,855 --> 00:59:49,899
I get so lonely.

858
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:53,027
What about that little girl
you've got cooped up in there?

859
00:59:53,277 --> 00:59:56,113
She make you happy?

860
00:59:56,113 --> 00:59:59,074
- Sometimes.
- Well, son,

861
00:59:59,116 --> 01:00:02,203
that's more than most folks ever get.

862
01:00:02,787 --> 01:00:05,873
Why don't you latch on to her
before she wises up?

863
01:00:06,874 --> 01:00:09,960
The whole scene
is starting to get unseemly.

864
01:00:11,462 --> 01:00:13,464
You hear me?

865
01:00:13,464 --> 01:00:16,634
She's legal now,
so what are you waiting for?

866
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:22,556
The right time.

867
01:00:22,807 --> 01:00:25,392
If that's the case, I'd check my watch,

868
01:00:25,392 --> 01:00:28,562
because if ever there was a time
to set things straight, it's now.

869
01:00:33,234 --> 01:00:35,861
- Congratulations, Son.
- Thank you, Daddy.

870
01:00:35,903 --> 01:00:38,989
- It wasn't how I imagined your wedding.
- I know what you're saying, Mum.

871
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:43,160
When the Colonel said he would take care
of it, I thought it would still be big.

872
01:00:44,578 --> 01:00:46,789
Yeah, it got out of hand with him.

873
01:00:46,831 --> 01:00:49,917
He didn't want it to be this big media
event and excluded half our friends.

874
01:00:51,085 --> 01:00:54,255
Red went home furious.

875
01:00:55,089 --> 01:00:56,674
I'm sorry, Mama.

876
01:00:56,674 --> 01:00:59,510
Come on.
We'll be late for the press conference.

877
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:02,388
Come on, baby. Sorry, Mama.

878
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:05,516
Press conference?
That's a real low-key event, yeah.

879
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:08,769
The Colonel would sell tickets
to the honeymoon if we let him.

880
01:01:44,305 --> 01:01:46,891
Cilla, my wife.

881
01:01:46,891 --> 01:01:50,060
I love you.

882
01:02:04,325 --> 01:02:07,286
They got me singin' to a dog.

883
01:02:07,328 --> 01:02:10,414
At least it's a talkin' dog.
There's a bunch of fans out at the gate.

884
01:02:11,165 --> 01:02:14,251
We best fly below the radar
so we get you to the airport pronto.

885
01:02:14,752 --> 01:02:17,213
- Can you believe I'll be a daddy?
- We can.

886
01:02:17,254 --> 01:02:20,174
We just can't believe
Priscilla's gonna be a mom.

887
01:02:20,174 --> 01:02:21,467
Hit it, Joe!

888
01:02:21,509 --> 01:02:23,719
Just a few more seconds, E.

889
01:02:23,761 --> 01:02:26,847
We're passin' through a
mob of fans here at the gate.

890
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,689
Little Lisa Marie.

891
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:39,026
- Isn't she the most beautiful thing?
- I know.

892
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:49,787
Oh, she's a miracle.

893
01:02:51,122 --> 01:02:54,291
I can't believe
I'm a part of this beautiful child.

894
01:02:56,043 --> 01:02:59,213
She's so perfect.

895
01:02:59,964 --> 01:03:03,050
Let's face it, Elvis. The movies
ain't doin' what they used to,

896
01:03:03,717 --> 01:03:06,637
and the records,
they're not doin' much better.

897
01:03:06,637 --> 01:03:09,807
It's the material you shove down
my throat. You can't polish a turd.

898
01:03:10,808 --> 01:03:13,978
Now don't go pointing blame.
The way you go through money,

899
01:03:14,478 --> 01:03:17,648
we can't just sit and wait
for good stuff to come along.

900
01:03:17,898 --> 01:03:21,068
You bought a ranch, couple
dozen pickup trucks for your pals,

901
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:25,156
I don't know how many horses,
and now a house in Beverly Hills.

902
01:03:26,574 --> 01:03:29,660
- You need the money, boy.
- All right, all right.

903
01:03:30,411 --> 01:03:32,329
What's the deal?

904
01:03:32,329 --> 01:03:35,499
Elvis, we need to
kick-start this career of yours.

905
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:39,920
We started big in TV,
and we can restart big in TV.

906
01:03:41,005 --> 01:03:44,175
I done made this deal with Singer
sewing machines for a Christmas special.

907
01:03:45,176 --> 01:03:48,345
No, now this is an
important opportunity, son.

908
01:03:48,429 --> 01:03:50,890
And if I flop, we're done.

909
01:03:50,931 --> 01:03:53,517
- You won't flop.
- Oh, come on, Colonel.

910
01:03:53,517 --> 01:03:56,687
It's one thing to flop
in a film that's been done.

911
01:03:57,104 --> 01:03:59,982
It's another to fall
on your face in front of...

912
01:04:00,024 --> 01:04:03,110
- How many saw The Ed Sullivan Show?
- Fifty-two million.

913
01:04:05,529 --> 01:04:07,364
Just meet the director.

914
01:04:07,364 --> 01:04:10,534
He's a young hotshot that's done
a couple of rock 'n' roll shows.

915
01:04:12,036 --> 01:04:15,206
You don't like him,
we get somebody else.

916
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:20,127
All right. I'll meet him.

917
01:04:20,127 --> 01:04:23,297
Let's be frank. I don't think most kids
know who the hell you are anymore.

918
01:04:26,217 --> 01:04:29,386
It's the '60s, man. You hear
what they're playin' on the radio?

919
01:04:30,221 --> 01:04:33,390
The Mamas and the Papas,
The Stones, Marvin Gaye...

920
01:04:33,724 --> 01:04:36,811
I know, I know. I listen to everything.

921
01:04:38,395 --> 01:04:41,190
The Rascals, Aretha Franklin.

922
01:04:41,232 --> 01:04:44,318
There's a song out right now, MacArthur
Park. Richard Harris sings it.

923
01:04:46,487 --> 01:04:49,657
- Would you have sung that tune?
- Damn right. That there's a great song.

924
01:04:50,825 --> 01:04:53,911
Jimmy Webb, he can flat-out write.

925
01:04:55,413 --> 01:04:58,499
Here's what I have in mind.
We tape it over three days.

926
01:04:58,666 --> 01:05:01,752
The first day is in front of a live
audience. Elvis' big comeback.

927
01:05:04,088 --> 01:05:07,174
Now, I know you'll be nervous,
so we'll just get that out of the way.

928
01:05:08,175 --> 01:05:11,345
The next two days,
we tape several staged numbers,

929
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:15,266
drawing on your own
personal and musical life.

930
01:05:16,684 --> 01:05:19,770
- I like it.
- There is a problem, Elvis.

931
01:05:21,772 --> 01:05:24,942
The Colonel and NBC want you
to sing just Christmas songs.

932
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,112
I think that's too limiting

933
01:05:28,112 --> 01:05:31,282
and the exact opposite
of what you should be doin'.

934
01:05:32,116 --> 01:05:35,286
What do you think?

935
01:05:36,454 --> 01:05:39,540
I think let's do it.
It's gonna be great, Steve.

936
01:05:40,791 --> 01:05:43,210
- All right, man.
- All right.

937
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:46,380
He's backstage, he'll be here.

938
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:49,550
What's goin' on, Elvis?

939
01:05:51,302 --> 01:05:54,388
I'm sorry, Steve.
I can't do it, man. I can't go on.

940
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,727
- What?
- This whole thing was just a bad idea.

941
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:06,317
I haven't played in front of a live
audience in more than seven years, man.

942
01:06:08,819 --> 01:06:11,906
I don't know if I can do it anymore.
And what if they don't like me?

943
01:06:15,159 --> 01:06:18,329
Don't like you? Oh, my God.

944
01:06:18,913 --> 01:06:21,999
Elvis, you created rock 'n' roll.

945
01:06:23,834 --> 01:06:25,836
You were the king.

946
01:06:25,836 --> 01:06:29,006
You step out there,
you're gonna be king again.

947
01:06:31,592 --> 01:06:33,761
It's just like ridin' a bike.

948
01:06:33,761 --> 01:06:36,931
Once you get out on stage,
it's gonna be like old times.

949
01:06:37,098 --> 01:06:40,267
I just went out there.
Those are your fans, Elvis.

950
01:06:40,351 --> 01:06:43,521
You can't let 'em down.
You have never let the fans down.

951
01:06:44,021 --> 01:06:46,941
- That's true.
- And some of 'em are lookers.

952
01:06:46,941 --> 01:06:49,151
I ain't gonna lie to you.

953
01:06:49,193 --> 01:06:51,862
If nothin' else, just do it for me.

954
01:06:51,862 --> 01:06:55,032
It'd be one of the few times I get to
play to your face instead of your ass.

955
01:07:07,211 --> 01:07:10,339
Don't worry about a thing.
It's just a jam session.

956
01:07:10,381 --> 01:07:13,467
You're just sittin' with the band.

957
01:07:14,718 --> 01:07:17,805
- Come on, E!
- My boy, my boy.

958
01:07:19,723 --> 01:07:22,810
- Oh, my, boys. Been a long time.
- Long time. Yes, siree.

959
01:07:23,727 --> 01:07:26,647
- It's been a while.
- I forgot what you looked like.

960
01:07:26,647 --> 01:07:29,817
Oh, did you now?

961
01:07:30,067 --> 01:07:33,154
- All right, good night.

962
01:07:37,658 --> 01:07:39,994
Well, what do I do now?

963
01:07:39,994 --> 01:07:43,164
- Play us somethin'.
- Well, all right.

964
01:07:44,832 --> 01:07:48,002
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Something wrong with my lip.

965
01:07:49,754 --> 01:07:52,923
Remember that one, baby?
I done 29 pictures like that.

966
01:07:53,758 --> 01:07:56,844
- And the finger, Elvis?
- The finger, that's right, the finger.

967
01:07:57,845 --> 01:08:01,015
I was down in Florida, and the state
police decided to come and film my show.

968
01:08:03,684 --> 01:08:06,854
I had to stand still, and all I could
move was this little finger here.

969
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:15,446
It got more applause than I did.

970
01:08:15,446 --> 01:08:18,616
Hey, Elvis, sing me that song
about Lawdy Miss Clawdy.

971
01:08:20,034 --> 01:08:22,787
Twelve years I've been
on stage with this man,

972
01:08:22,787 --> 01:08:25,956
and this is the first word
he's ever said to me. First word.

973
01:08:26,373 --> 01:08:29,460
And for that now I'm gonna take his
guitar. Come on, Scotty, give it up.

974
01:08:31,045 --> 01:08:34,131
That's all I got to say.

975
01:08:41,055 --> 01:08:44,141
Well lawdy, lawdy, lawdy Miss Clawdy

976
01:08:46,644 --> 01:08:49,730
Well you sure look good to me

977
01:08:52,483 --> 01:08:55,653
Well please don't excite me baby

978
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:58,906
I know it can't be me

979
01:09:02,076 --> 01:09:05,162
Well I give you all my money gal

980
01:09:07,665 --> 01:09:10,751
But you just don't treat me right

981
01:09:12,336 --> 01:09:15,506
You like to ball every morning

982
01:09:15,673 --> 01:09:18,843
Don't come home till late at night

983
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:26,350
I will tell, tell my mama

984
01:09:26,851 --> 01:09:28,978
Lord I swear to God

985
01:09:29,019 --> 01:09:32,106
What you've been doing to me

986
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:35,776
I'm gonna tell everybody that

987
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:39,530
I am in misery

988
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:44,869
I said bye

989
01:09:44,869 --> 01:09:46,912
Bye bye baby

990
01:09:46,954 --> 01:09:50,040
Girl I won't be calling no more

991
01:09:52,626 --> 01:09:55,713
Goodbye to little darlin'

992
01:09:55,713 --> 01:09:58,883
Down the road I go

993
01:09:59,049 --> 01:10:02,136
Da-da-da da da da-da ♪

994
01:10:06,474 --> 01:10:08,684
Thank you very much.

995
01:10:08,726 --> 01:10:11,812
That was a beautiful thing, man.
Did you hear 'em?

996
01:10:11,896 --> 01:10:13,647
My ears are still ringin'.

997
01:10:13,647 --> 01:10:16,817
- Just like the old days.
- Old days? Just listen to us.

998
01:10:16,901 --> 01:10:20,071
We're young. There's days ahead.
I'm gonna go down to Nashville.

999
01:10:20,821 --> 01:10:22,740
- Still got that studio?
- Yeah.

1000
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:25,910
We're gonna woodshed like we did before.
Come up with stuff and cut records.

1001
01:10:27,161 --> 01:10:30,331
- I love that idea.
- Once we're done, we'll tour again.

1002
01:10:30,998 --> 01:10:34,168
- I'm talkin' Europe, Japan, Australia.
- What about the Colonel?

1003
01:10:34,919 --> 01:10:38,005
I thought you never toured
because he was an illegal alien.

1004
01:10:38,339 --> 01:10:41,425
I don't know. Screw him.
We're gonna do it, brother.

1005
01:10:41,509 --> 01:10:44,595
We'll be waitin'.
Ready, willin' and half able.

1006
01:10:44,595 --> 01:10:47,765
Go on, D.J. I'll see you guys later.
Red! Come here, man.

1007
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:52,937
Get the car ready.
We're done for tonight.

1008
01:10:53,771 --> 01:10:56,941
- Steve, that was great.
- Congratulations. You were great.

1009
01:10:57,441 --> 01:11:00,528
- Thank you, brother.
- Hey, look at that.

1010
01:11:01,946 --> 01:11:05,032
- New beginnings.
- Yeah. A new beginnin'.

1011
01:11:09,036 --> 01:11:12,123
Let me ask you, do you ever think
about gettin' rid of the entourage?

1012
01:11:13,916 --> 01:11:16,377
It's not an entourage.
One is my driver,

1013
01:11:16,377 --> 01:11:19,547
one takes care of appointments,
and there's bodyguards.

1014
01:11:19,797 --> 01:11:22,091
You think you need the bodyguards?

1015
01:11:22,133 --> 01:11:25,094
I get bothered every time
I go out so, yeah.

1016
01:11:25,136 --> 01:11:28,222
Really? No offense, but when
was the last time you went out alone?

1017
01:11:29,056 --> 01:11:32,184
Uh...
It's been a while. It's been a while.

1018
01:11:35,146 --> 01:11:38,232
I bet you, if we went out
to Sunset Strip right now,

1019
01:11:39,316 --> 01:11:42,403
you wouldn't get bothered at all.

1020
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:47,408
- You think?
- I think.

1021
01:11:49,493 --> 01:11:52,663
I'll take you up on that bet. All right.

1022
01:11:53,581 --> 01:11:56,709
- Stairway's secure. Ready, E.
- I'm gonna go downstairs with Steve.

1023
01:11:57,668 --> 01:12:00,796
- I'll get the boys.
- No, just me and Steve. It's all right.

1024
01:12:04,842 --> 01:12:07,928
Come on. I'm gonna get changed.

1025
01:12:08,763 --> 01:12:11,932
Hey, how you doin'?

1026
01:12:13,517 --> 01:12:16,604
- Hey, how are you, man?
- Peace, man.

1027
01:12:17,688 --> 01:12:20,775
Hey, how you doin'?

1028
01:12:27,782 --> 01:12:30,868
It's 1968.
The times, they're a-changing, man.

1029
01:12:33,162 --> 01:12:36,290
You can change, too.

1030
01:12:39,126 --> 01:12:42,296
He's still dressed.

1031
01:12:42,797 --> 01:12:45,966
That's OK. I like to unwrap my presents.

1032
01:12:52,473 --> 01:12:55,017
What's wrong?

1033
01:12:55,059 --> 01:12:58,187
- I'm just goin' through some things.
- You worried about the TV show?

1034
01:12:59,897 --> 01:13:03,067
- Yeah.
- The hardest part's over, isn't it?

1035
01:13:03,984 --> 01:13:07,071
The audience loved you.

1036
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:10,199
Only two days of taping,
just like making a movie.

1037
01:13:12,743 --> 01:13:15,871
Why don't we make our own movie?

1038
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,087
We can't do this. It's too soon.

1039
01:13:23,921 --> 01:13:27,091
- Oh it's OK. The doctor says it's OK.
- It's not that, Cilla.

1040
01:13:29,927 --> 01:13:33,013
It's just...

1041
01:13:34,181 --> 01:13:37,309
I've never been able to make love
to a woman who's had a child.

1042
01:13:37,810 --> 01:13:40,563
What?

1043
01:13:40,604 --> 01:13:43,691
- I don't believe that.
- It's true.

1044
01:13:44,567 --> 01:13:47,695
Cos I'm a mama,
you can't make love to me?

1045
01:13:47,737 --> 01:13:50,114
I'm not your mama, Elvis.

1046
01:13:50,114 --> 01:13:53,284
Satinin', I love you.
And we'll be OK, I promise.

1047
01:13:56,203 --> 01:13:59,373
It's just...
I just need a little bit more time.

1048
01:14:00,207 --> 01:14:03,335
I got a lot goin' on right now.

1049
01:14:08,382 --> 01:14:10,634
I know you do, baby.

1050
01:14:10,676 --> 01:14:13,804
We have the amusement pier
and the bordello set.

1051
01:14:15,055 --> 01:14:18,017
Here we're gonna
build the road to nowhereville.

1052
01:14:18,017 --> 01:14:21,145
- Oh, man, I been on that road before.
- I hear that.

1053
01:14:21,228 --> 01:14:24,398
You two! Come here.

1054
01:14:32,073 --> 01:14:34,742
This is supposed to be
a Christmas special.

1055
01:14:34,742 --> 01:14:36,827
That's what we sold the sponsor.

1056
01:14:36,827 --> 01:14:39,997
Elvis feels we can not
have a proper Christmas special

1057
01:14:40,247 --> 01:14:43,334
unless we have at least one
Christmas song. Right, Elvis?

1058
01:14:45,419 --> 01:14:47,254
Yes, sir.

1059
01:14:47,254 --> 01:14:50,174
We're having somethin'
written for the finale.

1060
01:14:50,174 --> 01:14:53,177
- A Christmas song?
- Something special.

1061
01:14:53,177 --> 01:14:56,347
- Elvis insists on a Christmas song.
- I haven't heard that from Elvis.

1062
01:14:58,849 --> 01:15:01,936
I'm telling you that Elvis
wants a damn Christmas song.

1063
01:15:02,269 --> 01:15:04,772
Isn't that what you want, Elvis?

1064
01:15:04,772 --> 01:15:07,942
- Yes, sir.
- All right. Glad we got that settled.

1065
01:15:19,954 --> 01:15:23,082
Why do you put up with him
bullying you? Treatin' you like a child?

1066
01:15:25,459 --> 01:15:28,379
I've thought a lot about
that over the years.

1067
01:15:28,379 --> 01:15:31,507
I'd try to explain it to you,
but you just wouldn't understand.

1068
01:15:32,007 --> 01:15:35,136
- I think I do.
- How?

1069
01:15:35,636 --> 01:15:38,764
You know nothin' about
the world I come from.

1070
01:15:41,142 --> 01:15:44,311
Actually, I know a lot about you, Elvis.

1071
01:15:44,895 --> 01:15:47,857
It's my job.

1072
01:15:47,898 --> 01:15:50,985
You're not that poor kid from Tupelo
anymore. You live in the big house.

1073
01:15:53,404 --> 01:15:56,031
You could be your own boss man.

1074
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:59,160
And you've certainly
outgrown that old carny.

1075
01:16:02,246 --> 01:16:05,291
I gave him my word.

1076
01:16:05,332 --> 01:16:08,461
Besides, before me there was
no such thing as a rock star.

1077
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:15,676
He wrote the book on how to make one.

1078
01:16:16,302 --> 01:16:19,430
Anyone else I'll hire
will just have read it.

1079
01:16:22,183 --> 01:16:25,144
Well, maybe it's time
to write a new book.

1080
01:16:25,186 --> 01:16:28,314
Your own book.

1081
01:16:30,691 --> 01:16:33,152
I'm gonna get me a boss man

1082
01:16:33,194 --> 01:16:35,613
One who's gonna treat me right

1083
01:16:35,613 --> 01:16:38,074
I work hard in the day time

1084
01:16:38,115 --> 01:16:39,950
Rest easy at night

1085
01:16:39,950 --> 01:16:43,120
Big boss man

1086
01:16:43,704 --> 01:16:46,332
Can't you hear me when I call?

1087
01:16:46,373 --> 01:16:49,460
Can't you hear me when I call?

1088
01:16:49,794 --> 01:16:52,880
I said you ain't so big

1089
01:16:53,464 --> 01:16:56,634
You're just tall that's all...

1090
01:16:58,010 --> 01:17:00,513
- Cut, cut, cut!
- Was that all right?

1091
01:17:00,554 --> 01:17:03,641
- All right? Man, that was perfect.
- All right.

1092
01:17:03,891 --> 01:17:07,061
We're gonna go into the
Guitar Man sequence after that.

1093
01:17:07,228 --> 01:17:08,979
- I like it.
- That's great.

1094
01:17:08,979 --> 01:17:12,108
All right, all right.

1095
01:17:28,582 --> 01:17:31,669
What now?

1096
01:17:34,338 --> 01:17:35,965
What's this?

1097
01:17:36,006 --> 01:17:39,051
That's the demo for the finale.
Where'd you get it?

1098
01:17:39,093 --> 01:17:41,595
It's not a Christmas song.
It's one of them

1099
01:17:41,595 --> 01:17:44,765
hippie, communist,
American-hatin' protest songs.

1100
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:47,435
Actually, it's more like a gospel style.

1101
01:17:47,435 --> 01:17:50,604
It's a new direction, Colonel.
I like it, and I'm doin' it.

1102
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:54,316
What's going on here, Elvis?

1103
01:17:54,316 --> 01:17:57,236
Oh, just a few other new directions,
Colonel.

1104
01:17:57,278 --> 01:18:00,114
I'm gonna tour again.
Europe this time.

1105
01:18:00,114 --> 01:18:03,242
I don't care that you got
some birth certificate problem

1106
01:18:03,534 --> 01:18:06,162
or you're an illegal alien,
as some say.

1107
01:18:06,203 --> 01:18:09,290
And after Europe, I don't know.
Japan. Who knows?

1108
01:18:10,624 --> 01:18:13,043
Why are you being like this?

1109
01:18:13,085 --> 01:18:16,046
Cos I don't want to be bored anymore,
Colonel.

1110
01:18:16,046 --> 01:18:19,008
I don't want to sing
another song I don't believe in

1111
01:18:19,049 --> 01:18:21,552
or make another
movie I don't care about.

1112
01:18:21,552 --> 01:18:24,722
This TV thing has me excited
for the first time in years.

1113
01:18:25,097 --> 01:18:28,225
I'm havin' fun,
and I don't wanna lose that feeling.

1114
01:18:28,476 --> 01:18:31,562
A feeling? I'm not sending you out
on some cockamamie tour

1115
01:18:32,062 --> 01:18:34,106
just because of some feeling.

1116
01:18:34,148 --> 01:18:37,234
Then I'll find somebody who will.

1117
01:18:38,611 --> 01:18:41,739
Son, let me explain some things to you.
We have a contract...

1118
01:18:43,365 --> 01:18:46,494
You always told me a contract can be
re-negotiated. Broken, if need be.

1119
01:18:47,495 --> 01:18:50,289
Maybe it's time
we tore up this contract.

1120
01:18:50,331 --> 01:18:52,750
That's what you want?

1121
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:55,878
After all my years of dedication
to you and your career? All my work?

1122
01:18:57,254 --> 01:19:00,299
- You ungrateful hillbilly!
- Watch your mouth!

1123
01:19:00,341 --> 01:19:03,427
- Get out of my office!
- I paid for this office!

1124
01:19:03,844 --> 01:19:07,014
- You're fired.
- You can't fire me. I quit!

1125
01:19:07,264 --> 01:19:10,392
I'm holdin' a press conference
to tell 'em you're fired.

1126
01:19:11,185 --> 01:19:13,229
Go ahead!

1127
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:16,357
But if you wanna end
our business relationship,

1128
01:19:16,732 --> 01:19:19,110
you have to pay up what you owe me.

1129
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:21,570
Fine. Write me a bill.

1130
01:19:21,612 --> 01:19:24,698
Oh, I was expecting something like this,
so I prepared some documents.

1131
01:19:27,952 --> 01:19:31,122
There's money I've advanced you.

1132
01:19:32,623 --> 01:19:35,709
Then there's bookings that I haven't
taken my full commission from.

1133
01:19:36,877 --> 01:19:39,964
Then there's expenses, future
monies to deal with, movie profits,

1134
01:19:42,049 --> 01:19:45,136
I get a percentage of the residuals
on them too, and the records.

1135
01:19:45,970 --> 01:19:49,140
Then there's other
items of mutual interest.

1136
01:19:50,224 --> 01:19:53,394
So you wanna be free of me, you're
going to have to pay for the privilege.

1137
01:20:12,747 --> 01:20:15,207
Where we gonna
get millions of dollars?

1138
01:20:15,249 --> 01:20:16,792
I'll talk to my agents.

1139
01:20:16,834 --> 01:20:19,587
They in cahoots with the Colonel.

1140
01:20:19,587 --> 01:20:22,131
I'll get us a lawyer,
figure something out.

1141
01:20:22,173 --> 01:20:24,967
Lawyer's steal faster
than a man with a gun.

1142
01:20:25,009 --> 01:20:27,595
We could lose everything, E.

1143
01:20:27,595 --> 01:20:30,723
What about your word?
You made a promise. He kept up his end.

1144
01:20:31,223 --> 01:20:34,351
Lately his end's been draggin',
and I been doin' all the heavy liftin'.

1145
01:20:35,436 --> 01:20:38,564
I'll figure somethin' out.
Please, I'm dyin' here.

1146
01:20:41,108 --> 01:20:44,236
- I can manage myself.
- But how is all I'm askin'.

1147
01:20:45,112 --> 01:20:48,282
You can't handle money.
I got the bills to prove that.

1148
01:20:48,282 --> 01:20:50,201
You don't even carry any money.

1149
01:20:50,201 --> 01:20:53,370
You don't know your phone number.
How you gonna manage yourself?

1150
01:20:54,205 --> 01:20:57,333
- I'll get somebody else.
- Who? Who, Elvis?

1151
01:21:09,303 --> 01:21:12,431
I was thinking about
our conversation yesterday,

1152
01:21:12,973 --> 01:21:16,102
and if you want to tour,
well, I'll set it up. We'll tour.

1153
01:21:18,312 --> 01:21:19,980
What about the movies?

1154
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:22,817
Well, that's going to
be a harder nut to crack.

1155
01:21:22,858 --> 01:21:25,986
We're obligated to three films,
and the next has been set up.

1156
01:21:26,404 --> 01:21:29,573
It's called The Trouble With
Girls and How to Get Out of It.

1157
01:21:29,907 --> 01:21:33,077
Sounds like a winner.
What about this?

1158
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:37,498
Oh, that. Trifle.

1159
01:21:40,835 --> 01:21:43,921
- So where we gonna tour?
- Las Vegas. I cut us a hell of a deal.

1160
01:21:45,256 --> 01:21:48,384
Mr Presley, we need you on the set.

1161
01:21:48,676 --> 01:21:51,762
Think about it, son. Vegas.

1162
01:21:52,054 --> 01:21:55,182
Guess what, Steve?
I'm touring Vegas.

1163
01:21:57,017 --> 01:22:00,187
Can I get a marker ready, please?

1164
01:22:00,896 --> 01:22:04,024
And we're ready.

1165
01:22:07,194 --> 01:22:10,322
Quiet on the set, please.

1166
01:22:11,866 --> 01:22:14,994
- You ready, Elvis?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1167
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:18,289
If I Can Dream, scene 18. Mark it.

1168
01:22:39,477 --> 01:22:42,605
There must be lights
burning brighter somewhere

1169
01:22:46,817 --> 01:22:49,945
Got to be birds flying higher
in a sky more blue

1170
01:22:54,158 --> 01:22:57,286
If I can dream of a better land

1171
01:22:58,579 --> 01:23:01,665
Where all my brothers
walk hand in hand

1172
01:23:01,749 --> 01:23:03,918
Tell me why?

1173
01:23:03,959 --> 01:23:05,795
Oh why?

1174
01:23:05,836 --> 01:23:08,923
Oh why can't my dream come true?

1175
01:23:13,094 --> 01:23:16,263
Oh why?

1176
01:23:16,514 --> 01:23:19,642
There must be peace
and understanding sometime

1177
01:23:24,021 --> 01:23:26,565
Strong winds of promise

1178
01:23:26,607 --> 01:23:29,693
That will blow away
all the doubt and fear

1179
01:23:31,862 --> 01:23:34,949
If I can dream of a warmer sun

1180
01:23:36,117 --> 01:23:39,203
Where hope keeps shining on everyone

1181
01:23:39,787 --> 01:23:41,747
Tell me why?

1182
01:23:41,789 --> 01:23:43,666
Oh why?

1183
01:23:43,666 --> 01:23:46,794
Oh why won't that sun appear?

1184
01:23:56,303 --> 01:23:59,390
We're lost in a cloud

1185
01:24:00,141 --> 01:24:03,227
With too much rain

1186
01:24:03,978 --> 01:24:07,106
We're trapped in a world

1187
01:24:07,732 --> 01:24:10,901
That's troubled with pain

1188
01:24:11,652 --> 01:24:14,822
But as long as a man
has the strength to dream

1189
01:24:17,825 --> 01:24:20,995
He can redeem his soul and fly

1190
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:32,506
Deep in my heart
there's a trembling question

1191
01:24:36,927 --> 01:24:40,014
Still I am sure that the answer

1192
01:24:40,973 --> 01:24:44,101
Answer's gonna come somehow

1193
01:24:44,351 --> 01:24:47,521
Out there in the dark

1194
01:24:48,022 --> 01:24:51,108
There's a beckoning candle
Oh, yeah

1195
01:24:52,443 --> 01:24:54,653
And while I can think

1196
01:24:54,695 --> 01:24:56,447
While I can walk

1197
01:24:56,447 --> 01:24:58,407
While I can stand

1198
01:24:58,449 --> 01:25:00,242
While I can talk

1199
01:25:00,284 --> 01:25:03,412
While I can dream

1200
01:25:04,121 --> 01:25:07,208
Please let my dream

1201
01:25:07,792 --> 01:25:10,961
Come true
Whoa

1202
01:25:15,216 --> 01:25:18,385
Right now

1203
01:25:19,303 --> 01:25:22,389
Let it come true right now
