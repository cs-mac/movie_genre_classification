1
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,312
But did you know that Dostoyevsky
came to Spa to gamble, not to write?

2
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,917
A mad life.
A mad voice.

3
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,749
And in the peat moors of Wallonia
we hear another voice.

4
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,399
The even more famed voice of Apollinaire
whose words ring in our memory :

5
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,158
'Overwhelming grief'

6
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,238
"Strangled my heart
in the desolate fens"

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,908
"Life twists itself around strong trees"

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,590
"Life takes bites of death by degrees"

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,436
Thank you for your attention.

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,473
Thank you very much.

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,233
Will you be publishing those poems?

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,271
No, they're by Apollinaire.
- Shame.

13
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,755
Bravo, Mathieu, it was wonderful.

14
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,555
Victor is taking me home.
- See you tomorrow.

15
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,074
Why your interest in the fens?
- My father was from the fens.

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,397
Have you written much about them?
- Yes, all my life.

17
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,070
Where will it be published?
- I have a publisher in Liege.

18
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,198
You're miles away.

19
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,549
I wonder if I ran over an animal
this evening.

20
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,909
On the Grande Fagne moors.

21
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,549
What were you doing there?

22
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,356
I felt like driving around.

23
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,713
Did Victor take you home?

24
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,797
He found your examples remarkable.

25
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,755
When we drove through Verviers,
he asked me if I'd like a drink.

26
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,589
Redcurrants or raspberries?
- Cherries, Marie.

27
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,031
He drives on the left
when he's been drinking so I said :

28
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,994
"Let's have a drink at home
and wait for Mathieu."

29
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,199
Why do you always wear brown stockings?
- Because you like them.

30
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,914
It's the other guy who likes them.

31
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,397
I prefer light stockings.
- That's news to me.

32
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,034
Brown stockings are aggressive
and common.

33
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,270
Light stockings are distinguished.
Everyone knows that.

34
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,630
Some more brown bread?

35
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,674
It's not brown bread.
It's sourdough bread from Stoumont.

36
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,709
White bread is distinguished.

37
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,832
Sourdough bread is common.
Everyone knows that.

38
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,556
Did the other guy teach you that?
- Bread and stockings, it's the same.

39
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,399
Mad. She's out of her mind.

40
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,956
It's dripping, Jeanne.
- OK, it's dripping...

41
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,871
I'll finish this first.

42
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,157
Otherwise I can't control
the sugar to milk ratio.

43
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,831
I've been saying this for twenty years.
Mind the drip.

44
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,148
What did Victor want?

45
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,319
I asked him in. As you know...
- Yes, he drives on the left.

46
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,556
So you let him in.

47
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,714
Yes, he wanted to show me his module.
- His module?

48
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,430
Did Victor show you his module?

49
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,200
Quiet, or she'll never finish the story.

50
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,355
Milk?

51
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,997
He wanted to show me the new module
for the Town Council.

52
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,599
Are you listening?
- Of course.

53
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,753
Will you take me or can I have the car?

54
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,393
Here.

55
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,631
What a night, eh?

56
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,869
There. Now eat. Eat.
I feel very well.

57
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,669
We're meeting at eleven, remember?

58
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,709
We're meeting at eleven.
- Go and choose furniture.

59
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,997
You won't lose everything.
I'm leaving my cat behind.

60
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,719
You can keep your cat,
because you don't have another one.

61
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,912
Okay, okay.

62
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,428
Can I have the car for 10 minutes?
- When we get to the museum.

63
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,675
Could it have been a dream?
- Tell me, Marie...

64
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,349
Yes?

65
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,793
You could wear long skirts. You don't
have to show your thighs to the world.

66
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,958
John likes it.
- "John likes it".

67
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,550
Are you going to find the animal?
Do you know where it is?

68
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,639
It can't have gone far.
Come along, they're waiting for me.

69
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,714
65,925.

70
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,559
Good morning, Vincent.
- Mr Victor is here.

71
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,992
Where is he?
- In the archive.

72
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,710
He's lost in the archive.

73
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,154
I'm not in for anyone, Vincent.

74
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,835
I've a problem with my anthology
of legends from the Ardennes.

75
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,679
I'd like your opinion.

76
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,749
In the archive of Verviers
I found an original act from 1813.

77
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,871
It's so extraordinary

78
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,675
that I wonder if I should include it
in the historical section.

79
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,552
I know.

80
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,350
What do you know?

81
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,348
Jeanne told me everything.
- Everything?

82
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,031
That you are awful
and that you drive on the left.

83
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,677
She's confused.
She's mixing things up.

84
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,314
Listen, this is my problem.

85
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,318
"ln memory of the late brothers
Henri and Renard,

86
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,035
wretchedly murdered at the
unspeakable place that is Pont Noir,

87
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,631
I, Martin le Podestat, their father,
have had written, in their memory..."

88
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,479
However, Henri had the reputation

89
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,717
of being unspeakable himself
because of the evil eye.

90
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,948
He died when he drowned
in a pool at Pont Noir.

91
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,792
But then... do you follow me?

92
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,439
Why does their father say
"wretchedly murdered"?

93
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,188
It's contradictory, you see?

94
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,948
I've never liked modern art.

95
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,675
Is this dog yours?

96
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,233
Don't be afraid.
I am sorry about last night.

97
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,112
I didn't see him.

98
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,711
It was a sharp bend.
I thought I had hit a deer.

99
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,388
You're not from around here?

100
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,955
No, wait, I want to help you.

101
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,355
You can't leave the dog like that.

102
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,230
If you're scared...

103
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,632
Damn.

104
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,917
Look, here...

105
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,831
How did it go in Liege?

106
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,270
Extraordinary. Yes.

107
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,431
Extraordinary.

108
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,430
"Gales and gusts
Trapped in the hollows of the dead fens"

109
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,430
"And undone in..."
"Gales and gusts", superb alliteration.

110
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,070
One of my colleagues in Verviers
said to me only last night :

111
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,195
"Of all the poets of the fen,
Mathieu Gregoire has the finest pen."

112
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,435
That's nice, eh?

113
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:21,112
And then : "Creature of the moors
Girl as dark as night"

114
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,118
So simple, so sublime.

115
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,108
Allow me to tell you, Jeanne...
- Don't hold back, Victor.

116
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:34,635
Without you, this source
would be less bountiful.

117
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,431
That's beautifully put.

118
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,518
Just one more. Here.

119
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,358
The more so since the book is dedicated
to Marie, and without me, Marie...

120
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,958
We chose the furniture this morning.
- She's still not back.

121
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,959
Victor, you must have thought
of something for your presentation.

122
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,871
I was talking to Jeanne about it.
If I may...

123
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,036
You may, Victor.

124
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,552
He was thinking of something modern.
Russian writers. Tolstoy and so on.

125
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:17,438
Solzhe... Solzhenitsyn. His traditional
side, his revolutionary side...

126
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,234
Our audience...
- Jeanne, the plum liqueur?

127
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,677
Our audience is a fairly mixed one.

128
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,556
We have to find the modulus.

129
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,878
And it's a good thing that...

130
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,872
Drenched.
I am drenched.

131
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,038
"ln bitter gall and deadly poison."

132
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,556
Sorry?

133
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,233
"The sweetness of love is drenched
in bitter gall and deadly poison."

134
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,829
Maurice Sceve, sixteenth century.

135
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,435
I'm going to discuss Louise Labe.

136
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,309
Labe?

137
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,233
The Beautiful Rope Maker
lover of ice and fire.

138
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,192
Sixteenth-century sonnets.

139
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,071
"l live, I die, I burn and I drown."

140
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,518
"Labbe", did you say?
- One "B".

141
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:29,711
Aren't you afraid that's too obscure
for most people?

142
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,071
Physical love is their bread and butter.

143
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,511
This is delicious.

144
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,277
Sour plums from our own garden.

145
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,119
Distilled in the abbey.
- No, no more.

146
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,788
You're on foot today.
- That's true.

147
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,711
Well, I'm going to say goodbye,
dear friends.

148
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,435
They can wait a little longer.
- I have no one waiting for me.

149
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,635
I was suddenly thinking...

150
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,069
Who will be reading
Louise Labe's poems? An actress?

151
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,794
You could find an actress, Victor.

152
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,189
I'll get an actress from Liege then,
to prevent local jealousy.

153
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,070
Goodnight, dear Jeanne.

154
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,754
"Gales and gusts"

155
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,995
"Trapped in the hollows of dead forests"
Mathieu...

156
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,795
Sometimes I miss teaching.

157
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,118
Don't forget the actress.

158
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,793
She's still not back.
- She'll come.

159
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,310
Can't they just take the last train?
- You know they like to take the road.

160
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,354
We can't sit and wait for her all night.

161
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,551
She has her key.

162
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,116
I have to wait and lock up.
I've done that for fifteen years.

163
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,072
In my own house.

164
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,350
And it's over with Victor.

165
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,515
Victor?

166
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,598
Do you think I'm blind?
"May I say, my dear Jeanne..."

167
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,109
To your hands and your eyes
I hold no surprise

168
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,236
Marie knows what she's doing.
And John is not a bad young man.

169
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,913
Don't look so worried.

170
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,710
Go to sleep. I'll join you later.

171
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,277
Good night, Mathieu.

172
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,632
Good night, Jeanne.

173
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,438
I'm not going to wait till daybreak.

174
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,556
I won't wait all night
until madam comes home.

175
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,632
It's always the same.

176
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,080
In the past it was girl friends
and now...

177
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,237
I'll bolt the door and switch off
the lights. I'm going up to Jeanne.

178
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,790
Keep your cat.
You don't have another.

179
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,070
I'm cross. Very cross.

180
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,354
She's not too old for a beating.

181
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,913
Incredible.

182
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:32,195
Juliette... Come here, come.
Come, Juliette.

183
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,428
See you tomorrow.
- Yes, tomorrow.

184
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,197
Don't forget to bolt the door.

185
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,551
Can I borrow the Volvo?
- Yes, of course.

186
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,389
Don't forget.
Lock the door. Lock it.

187
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,349
Lock the door. She no longer
has a dog. She's lost it.

188
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,749
She doesn't have her dog any more.

189
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,510
Her dog is dead. She's lost her dog.
Cat and dog... no.

190
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,030
No, it's a foreigner.
She's lost her dog.

191
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,276
You see?
She hasn't got her dog now.

192
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,993
A dog and a cat. No, no.

193
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,352
He's a foreigner, you see?
A foreigner.

194
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,358
Hello?

195
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,515
Hello?

196
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,313
I couldn't just leave you here.

197
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,749
No, there's no need to be afraid.

198
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,158
I didn't know what to do.
Maybe you need my help?

199
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,591
Why are you here?

200
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,316
It's going to get very cold.

201
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,149
But that's none of my business.
It's your business.

202
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,077
Do you understand me?

203
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,429
No?

204
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,038
That cape isn't going to keep you warm.

205
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,356
You're running a temperature.

206
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,630
Your feet must be freezing.

207
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,109
I'll be back with medication.

208
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,311
Medication.

209
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,635
My name is Mathieu Gregoire.

210
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,553
Go on then.

211
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,836
That's better, isn't it?

212
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,838
Hello, Mr Gregoire.

213
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,710
We'd given up waiting for you.

214
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,550
Will you take my place?

215
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,030
We don't see you very often now,
Mathieu.

216
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,596
I expect that suits you, doesn't it?

217
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,271
I found a young, charming actress.

218
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,996
She's very cultured.

219
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,351
We talked about Louise Labe
and she knows her work.

220
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,759
What a terrific choice :

221
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,758
"Kiss me again and kiss me more"

222
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,396
"A luscious kiss
alive with your love"

223
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,828
Wonderful, isn't it?

224
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,713
Ask the Deputy.

225
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,679
Victor, you've lost.

226
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,189
So what are you complaining about?

227
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,951
Are they getting married soon?
- There's no rush.

228
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,390
We were 1 9 when we got married.

229
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:15,754
"Time flies by", as Marot said.

230
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,949
Or was it Ronsard?

231
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,516
Alas, time may freeze
But we never cease

232
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,912
You were out a long time.
We thought you might be here.

233
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,350
I was copying documents for Vincent.

234
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,676
What are you writing now?

235
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,554
One only knows
when it's finished, Marie.

236
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,635
We'd like to get married at the end
of November. A civil wedding.

237
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,639
All right.

238
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,230
When is the contract signed?
A week before the wedding?

239
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,958
The day before.

240
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,519
Belle?

241
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,516
Come here. Come on.

242
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,760
You are Belle. Yes, Belle.

243
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,318
I won't ask anything more of you.
Never speak to me.

244
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,795
I don't want to know who you are.
Come on.

245
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,479
Everything's all right.

246
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,312
Listen, Belle.

247
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,353
Listen, Belle.

248
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,911
Gales and gusts

249
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:54,035
Trapped in the hollows of dead forests
And undone in your hair

250
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,798
I don't know why.

251
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,878
A poet reciting his own work,
that's ridiculous.

252
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,756
I can tell you everything because you
understand nothing and say nothing.

253
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,994
It's settled for November 28th.

254
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,510
On November 24th
we sign at the notary's office.

255
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,636
Bring the wood in.

256
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,432
The wood.

257
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,115
Where have you been all this time?

258
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,272
I forgot the salt.

259
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,638
Can I use the Volvo for a few hours?

260
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,953
Can I use the Volvo?

261
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,391
I have to be in Liege at eleven.
- I'll be back at ten.

262
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,991
You're always late.
- Ten sharp at the kiosk, OK?

263
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,710
Where have you been all this time?

264
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,159
I didn't see you at the museum.

265
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,035
I wanted to let you know that I think,
if I may say so

266
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,949
I've found a new classification method
for the fen legends.

267
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,232
For my volume of legends, remember?

268
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,036
Are you listening, Mathieu?

269
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,949
I wanted to ask you

270
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,994
if I could use the same method
for the library filing cards.

271
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,077
I'm in a hurry, I'm waiting for my car.

272
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,793
But couldn't we...

273
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,232
Yes. An important appointment in Liege.
My publisher is very punctual.

274
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,035
You're having a lot of success in Liege.

275
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,878
Right, Mathieu?

276
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,396
Don't you know what time it is?
What will they say in Liege?

277
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,717
Could you give me a lift to Liege?

278
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,155
I have to go somewhere else first.

279
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,394
Belle?

280
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,351
You mustn't worry so much when I'm late.

281
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,877
What...?

282
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,839
Here.

283
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,473
Belle.

284
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,358
Thank you.

285
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,510
I will ask Thomart to do the catering.

286
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,078
Does he do catering?
- Yes.

287
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,033
He did the wedding
at the Collignon's.

288
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,190
And then I went to the bank.
The money seems to be going fast.

289
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,950
I bought some reference books
on the 16th century.

290
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,191
And the repairs on the Volvo
also cost a pretty penny.

291
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,715
You know, Mathieu,
I never ask anything of you.

292
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,440
Is your talk progressing well?

293
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,718
Yes and no.

294
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,910
Are you worrying about Marie?

295
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,711
I will introduce you to the audience
at six o'clock.

296
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,515
And at eight there's a discussion.

297
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,115
Can you give me a lift?

298
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,996
Who is that man?

299
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,396
Why did you run away?

300
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,631
Where did he come from?

301
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,916
How did he find you again?

302
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,919
I asked Thomart what it would cost,
but he hasn't replied yet.

303
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,078
If it's more than 25,000, I'll say no.

304
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:04,278
Refurbishing the living room
will also cost a packet.

305
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,832
Are you listening, Mathieu?

306
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,590
I don't want to take
all the responsibility on my own.

307
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,995
It concerns you too!

308
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,715
Mathieu, are you listening?

309
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,434
Mathieu, listen to me!

310
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:32,591
What's got into you? Why don't you
answer? I'm not just an animal, am l?

311
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,196
No, don't touch me. No.

312
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,550
Do you want to leave?
Do you want us to leave?

313
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,753
Belle?

314
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,873
Tell me...

315
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:57,630
Is that man your husband?
Your boyfriend? An accomplice?

316
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,352
Or is he a rebel?

317
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,998
Tell me.

318
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,355
It can't go on like this.

319
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,674
We have to put an end to it.

320
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,916
We have a few minutes to decide.

321
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,999
I have to give a talk at six o'clock.
At six.

322
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,669
It's no use running away.
He will find us.

323
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,830
Or we'd have to leave the country.

324
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,352
Go very far away.

325
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,796
We'd need money.

326
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,996
It's ridiculous.

327
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:19,359
You have to break with that guy.
Make it clear to him.

328
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,997
I'm going to talk to him.

329
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,596
Where is he?

330
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,433
Oh, God, no! Damn!

331
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,638
Belle, he's gone, with my car!
All my papers are in it!

332
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,469
My talk...
They're already waiting for me!

333
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,869
Wait till I get hold of him!

334
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,436
Sort this out once and for all!

335
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,511
We've got to kill him! Kill him!

336
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,233
Presents.

337
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,313
Tinned food.

338
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,793
Wine.

339
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,432
Pineapple.

340
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,637
Trinkets from Spa.

341
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,753
Mathieu Gregoire. Present.

342
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:26,990
It's madness. He's been driving
through my town in my Volvo!

343
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,998
He's gone to shops where they know me!

344
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,877
Now everybody knows!
He's going to ruin us!

345
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,957
You base creature!

346
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,151
See what I do with your present!

347
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,949
What happened?
- Car broke down. Nothing serious.

348
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,435
I'm sorry. It was nothing, really.

349
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,349
May I introduce Mariette Mirmont?
Mathieu?

350
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:04,235
I haven't seen your paper.
What am I to read?

351
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,556
And in what style?

352
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:22,029
The love sonnets of Louise Labe,
the Beautiful Rope Maker.

353
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:28,879
We are less familiar with her Debate
between Folly and Love or her elegies

354
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:35,838
in which she admits having been
struck early by the darts of love.

355
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:43,709
"Not sixteen winters had I seen
When first love's perils took me in"

356
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,870
But the young soldier
who seduced her went to war.

357
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,958
And then she had other lovers.

358
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,793
The 1 6th century seems
far removed from us.

359
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,879
You will find that Louise Labe,
just like Maurice Sceve

360
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:04,358
at first sight seems to drown us
in unusual language.

361
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:09,759
Simple thoughts, which we all know well

362
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,509
but which we do not recognize
at first sight.

363
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,870
Knowledge and recognition.

364
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,277
Allow me to make a musical comparison.

365
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:28,072
This is the national interpretation
by a distant people

366
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:31,431
of a tune well-known
to our southern neighbours.

367
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,791
I wonder if you will recognize it.

368
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,311
So you recognized it.

369
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,117
Who did you, O Diana, meet on the way

370
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,278
Who took your bow and arrows away?

371
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,317
I teased, says she, a passer-by

372
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,592
At whom I cast my shafts in vain

373
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:32,430
And last my bow. He took them up

374
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:37,919
And shooting, broke my heart in twain

375
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,031
Bravo.

376
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:53,116
Louise confidently opposes
the folly of love with everyday life.

377
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:58,110
But is lost in the arms
of her lover in Sonnet Xlll.

378
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,390
If I hold him close to me

379
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,716
The way the ivy clasps the tree

380
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,718
Death comes, in envy of my bliss

381
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,718
Of kiss upon still sweeter kiss

382
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,549
Then will I die, in ecstasy

383
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:18,437
No, not "lf I hold him, death comes".
It's "lf as I hold him, death comes".

384
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,837
If death came
while he gave me kiss upon sweeter kiss

385
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,919
I would die in ecstasy.
Isn't that it? I would die happy.

386
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,477
"Never without love"
could have been her motto.

387
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,035
But also "never without pain".

388
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,710
Because in the 1 6th century
there are few more moving words :

389
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,752
I live, I die, I burn and drown

390
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,111
I quake with cold and perish with heat

391
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,313
My life so hard and yet so sweet

392
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,831
At once I shrivel and l...

393
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,954
Who has a question for the speaker?

394
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,879
What's so special
about that 1 6th-century author?

395
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,996
It is a timeless expression of love.

396
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:16,352
Why are you speaking on a subject
that doesn't interest us?

397
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,271
Bravo, Mr Gregoire, it went very well.

398
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,311
Are you mad?

399
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,353
You will pay for this.
I'm calling the police.

400
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,471
I was mistaken. I am truly sorry.

401
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:00,036
I want the police.
I'm going to lodge a complaint.

402
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,797
I am from Robertville.

403
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,679
"lf I were clutched unto his chest"
lf.

404
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:18,113
"lf his arms would grasp me tight
And if he said : Let us delight"

405
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,595
You see why I stress the "if"?

406
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:26,557
Jeanne, we must try to persuade
the man to drop the charges.

407
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,909
"lf I hold him close to me"

408
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,429
It's very subtle.

409
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:38,111
Those people upset him.
It's unbelievable.

410
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:41,551
I will make sure Mathieu explains.

411
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,993
Congratulations, Mr Gregoire,
I enjoyed your talk very much.

412
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,760
A pity today's youngsters are so rude.

413
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:55,637
I tried explaining it
to that charming foreigner in your car.

414
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:59,469
He didn't understand me.
Didn't speak German or French.

415
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,468
Thank you, Mrs Jolite.
- For a foreigner he was very friendly.

416
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,911
Again, congratulations and thank you.

417
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,909
If you should ever need me,
I am at your service.

418
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:14,317
It's a promise, I'll call you.

419
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:23,710
I was saying to Mr Gregoire,
today's youngsters are so rude.

420
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:28,914
But I did enjoy the evening
and wanted to congratulate him.

421
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:32,996
I did like your presentation,
Mr Gregoire.

422
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:38,433
And I wonder and so does Marie

423
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,310
whether your approach to the aspect...

424
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:49,316
the poetic aspect as seen
through the biography of the poet

425
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,318
reveals the essence of her work.

426
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,353
I mean to say,
what you wished to demonstrate.

427
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:59,955
That's why I brought you
a small present.

428
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:07,319
A collection of articles by Genette.
Gerard Genette. Do you know him?

429
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:13,914
And a collection of texts by Barthes.

430
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,591
I thought...
- Of course, thank you.

431
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,633
Right.

432
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,510
Everybody here wants to think for me.

433
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:58,670
Let it be, Mathieu.
Let's go. Come.

434
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,668
What's she like, the woman in Liege?

435
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,990
Brunette? Blonde?

436
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,356
A pert behind?

437
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,077
Is she naughty?

438
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,398
Does she bite?

439
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:38,233
She's great, good friend. A horse.
- A horse?

440
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:44,114
Yes, shaped like this. And that.

441
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:50,717
She scratches. And she has
a wonderful curve to her waist.

442
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:57,917
Like the finest Rubens.
- Rubens?

443
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:06,439
Mathieu, my friend.
Welcome back, brother.

444
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,716
The whole city lies at my feet.

445
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:14,230
I want to meet her. Take me along.

446
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,670
What? You idiot.

447
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,199
Scum! Bastards!

448
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,719
Let us sleep.

449
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,434
I will prove to you that I love women.

450
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,072
To you alone.

451
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,918
Come along to my house.
- What?

452
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,837
My collection.

453
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,233
Come.

454
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,552
Coarse, dark hair.

455
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,515
For the hollow in the hips

456
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,716
and the curve of the buttocks.

457
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,151
Supple hairs

458
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,392
tightly packed

459
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,434
for in between.

460
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,072
Soft, blonde hairs.

461
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,312
Perfect

462
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:37,193
for the gentle stimulation

463
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,511
of the tender inner thigh.

464
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:55,111
My Belle.

465
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,438
It doesn't work
with that man here.

466
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,595
Either he goes or we go.

467
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:20,675
We cannot go, so he has to go
whether he likes it or not.

468
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,588
I won't leave without you,
that's certain.

469
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,110
This is unbearable.

470
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,314
Nobody in the area knows him.

471
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,717
And no one has seen him.

472
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,036
Except in Spa perhaps.

473
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,670
Did he go into town again?

474
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,272
Into town?

475
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,996
Then there's no risk.

476
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,640
We must force him to go.

477
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,517
He will come back.

478
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,713
We can't stop him from coming back.

479
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,434
And compromising us.

480
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,356
There's no point talking to him.

481
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,916
If it has to be done...

482
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:37,477
Belle, at the firebreak. There.

483
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,839
Tomorrow four o'clock sharp.
The edge of the forest. The firebreak.

484
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,673
You will come with him.

485
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,552
Understood?

486
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,437
Why did you do that?

487
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,518
Volvo.

488
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:15,232
Keep out of sight.

489
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,315
We must go far away.

490
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,751
But not now.
Most of all we must be careful.

491
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,190
We mustn't arouse suspicion.

492
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:34,036
We mustn't meet for a few days.
You'll have food.

493
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:39,356
Monday, after the wedding,
I'll get money from the bank.

494
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:43,314
We will cross the border at night
through the forest.

495
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:47,752
Four o'clock. If I'm not there,
you hide and wait for me.

496
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,830
But don't act suspicious.

497
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,635
She'll be back, you'll see.

498
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,550
She'll come and see us soon.

499
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:45,951
At first life will be difficult
for her and then...

500
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,711
She'll manage all right.

501
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,511
She's happy.

502
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,679
And you?

503
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,076
I'm not unhappy.

504
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,918
I love you, Jeanne. I love you.

505
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,154
I have never stopped loving you.

506
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,555
I have never loved you so much.

507
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,551
I have to go.

508
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:27,874
Leave this place.
Stop writing.

509
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:34,075
Life is passing me by.
It has no purpose.

510
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,599
Excuse me.

511
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,315
Excuse me, don't take any notice.

512
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:58,790
Annie. How beautiful you look.
Hello, Marcel.

513
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,470
Thank you for the flowers.
They're wonderful.

514
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,716
I'm so glad to see you.

515
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,394
You look so radiant.
- Thank you.

516
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:12,310
How is Mathieu?
- Shouldn't you be asking after Marie?

517
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,715
Yes, that's true. Where is she?

518
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:19,198
She's busy packing suitcases.

519
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,358
Thank you.

520
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:31,031
I'm going to publish Folly and Love
with a new preface.

521
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:35,552
It will be interesting in connection
with what they're doing in Verviers.

522
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:42,672
May I congratulate you?
- You may, Victor.

523
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,876
Very beautiful, the...

524
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:52,108
I shall go and say hello to Jeanne.

525
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:58,277
I didn't notice you, I'm sorry.
Good afternoon.

526
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,029
Don't worry. I'll call him.

527
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:11,553
Marcel wishes to speak to you.
- Only for a moment. I apologize.

528
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:18,916
I shouldn't disturb you on a day
like this but I have to talk to you.

529
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,749
It's an insignificant thing.
I'm sure you know what I mean.

530
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:27,431
I'll come and see you in the museum
on Monday afternoon.

531
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:47,959
In Belgium, you can only publish poetry
at your own expense or in magazines.

532
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:53,029
Up to the age of six she was
very quiet, like her father.

533
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:58,470
But once she went to school
she changed.

534
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:01,069
She had such good teachers.

535
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:04,829
She really flourished then.

536
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,995
Very delicate.

537
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,350
Must be a good year.

538
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,915
It's a Chateau La Conseillante from '38.

539
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:30,829
We also drank it at Marie's
First Communion.

540
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:29,030
Well, have a good journey.
- Do you have some money?

541
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,149
I'd like to buy something
on the way.

542
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:17,348
Come on, Belle, we're going away.
Right now.

543
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,198
Right now.

544
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:24,039
Money, Mathieu. Money.

545
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,992
That's true.
What was I thinking?

546
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,511
Money.

547
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:15,954
Will you play for us, Jeanne?
- No, it's too long since I've played.

548
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:19,357
Please.
- Jeanne, don't make us beg.

549
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,471
Just play something.

550
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:34,989
I was on the way to the museum
and now I bump into you.

551
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,839
We're always chasing behind
and time flies by.

552
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,429
Or we never cease, as you put it.

553
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:45,957
Everything all right with Jeanne?

554
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:47,549
Yes, thank you.

555
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:51,469
It's not serious.
Just a matter of routine.

556
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:57,232
The man from Robertville that you hit
did lodge a complaint.

557
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,079
Now I have to ask you some questions.

558
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:05,877
I didn't want to spoil the fun
at the wedding.

559
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,069
Of course.

560
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:11,558
Perhaps we could go
to Robertville together?

561
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:16,151
I have to take those gentlemen there
too, for a different case.

562
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:20,432
Do you mean now?

563
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:23,119
As you wish.

564
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,035
To avoid any unpleasantness.

565
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:31,396
All right. Thanks, Marcel. But quickly
because I have other commitments.

566
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,070
I'll come in your car.

567
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,472
Would you rather I'd been on my own?

568
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:51,553
No, no.

569
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,999
Which road do you want
to take to Robertville?

570
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:04,549
Doesn't matter.
Take the road you know best.

571
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:57,597
Over there.
The body is in a hole.

572
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:59,836
Since when, Mathieu?

573
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,913
Thursday.

574
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,472
But it's a dog.

575
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,389
I must be mistaken.

576
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,677
Idiot.

577
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:14,956
Wait for me in the car.

578
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,950
What does this mean?

579
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:24,030
I received a note
from the German authorities.

580
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:28,028
A young smuggler was found
near the border.

581
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:32,589
For our friendship's sake
I tried to keep you out of it.

582
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,638
You've been tricked somehow.

583
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,714
You're not making it easy for me.

584
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,395
What kind ofgame is this?

585
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:53,352
Ifhe's still alive
why is she still waiting for me?

586
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:19,589
They robbed me,
tricked me from the start.

587
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,719
Thoroughly.

588
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:25,029
They're already long gone.

589
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,235
She couldn't do it.

590
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,197
She didn't trick me.

591
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:14,672
She killed him for me,
together with me.

592
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:20,038
We carried him together.

593
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:22,879
Drowned him together.

594
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,719
In one of the pools at Pont Noir.

595
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:27,713
A pool

596
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,871
at Pont Noir.

597
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:08,435
She really did it for me.

598
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,833
It's all true.

599
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,558
It's all true.

600
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:20,355
She didn't deceive me.

601
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,435
As long as she comes back.

602
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:29,151
As long as she comes back.
