1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,005
Man Ok, we're home!

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,008
Ah! Did she still not find it?

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,010
What is the problem?

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,013
See... that is...

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:17,017
That is I believe that Stylist Jang lost a watch.

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,019
Watch?

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,021
Which watch?

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,025
The watch that was sponsored this time.

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,029
Ha! She made such a big deal asking us to keep it safely,

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,032
How could she lose that?

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,036
Hey, Jang Man Ok, are you crazy...?

12
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,048
Why are you yelling?

13
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,057
I heard you lost the watch.

14
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,059
Are you insane?

15
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,012
Watch? What kind of watch?

16
00:01:02,012 --> 00:01:04,014
Our sponsored watch?!

17
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:07,017
Do you know how much the watch cost?

18
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:10,110
Even your lifetime salary will not be enough.

19
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,112
Ah! Be quiet.

20
00:01:12,112 --> 00:01:15,115
Man Ok, What happened? When and where did you lose it?

21
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:19,119
After I followed you to take the watch from you. . .

22
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,122
Then, I came back to the make-up room

23
00:01:22,122 --> 00:01:23,123
The watch has gone.

24
00:01:23,123 --> 00:01:24,124
Bravo!

25
00:01:24,124 --> 00:01:26,126
Well done! You haven't start that long yet you lost the watch.

26
00:01:26,126 --> 00:01:29,129
You end up losing a watch that is sponsored?

27
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:32,132
If you don't find it, you'll have to pay for watch. What are you going to do now?

28
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:35,135
Are you adding oil to fire now?

29
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:37,137
Hey, you may go first.Please leave now.

30
00:01:37,137 --> 00:01:41,141
If you can't handle this properly, then you'll be out immediately.

31
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:44,144
Ms. Jang Co-di

32
00:01:44,144 --> 00:01:46,146
I will definitely find it! Everything will be fine if I find it.

33
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:50,150
How? Do you think the watch will appear if you cry like this here?

34
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,153
If you sit and cry, will someone solve it for you instead?

35
00:01:55,155 --> 00:01:57,157
You said you were a pro?!

36
00:01:57,157 --> 00:01:58,158
Ah! Please! Give it a break!

37
00:01:58,158 --> 00:02:01,021
I told you to get out!

38
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:08,028
Clean everything up!!

39
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:13,213
I will find the watch. I have to find it!

40
00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:16,216
I will help you look for it.

41
00:02:17,217 --> 00:02:21,221
That person. I don't like him from head to toe.

42
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:25,225
Especially that lips! I hate it the most!

43
00:02:28,228 --> 00:02:32,232
What did I do? Did I say a wrong thing?

44
00:02:32,232 --> 00:02:35,235
This is my chance to get her fired and I will not see her ever again!

45
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,243
Why aren't leaving?

46
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:44,244
Because of this.

47
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:46,246
What is this?

48
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:49,249
The cat pajamas you got at the fan meeting.

49
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:52,252
I packed it and brought if but I didn't know what to do with it.

50
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:54,254
Get rid of this.

51
00:02:56,256 --> 00:03:00,030
I thought it wouldn't be possible because of your allergies.

52
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:04,034
Then is it alright if I give it Kang Hwi hyung?

53
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:06,036
He asked me to give it to him earlier.

54
00:03:06,036 --> 00:03:08,038
That's alright. Leave it in the basement.

55
00:03:08,038 --> 00:03:09,039
In the basement?

56
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,311
Yes! the basement!

57
00:03:12,312 --> 00:03:14,314
Yes.

58
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:20,320
Thank you, Kang Hwi.

59
00:03:22,322 --> 00:03:23,323
Go get inside now.

60
00:03:23,323 --> 00:03:26,326
No, I said I will send you home.

61
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:30,330
Oh! It'll be the first time you're riding my car. My car is really nice.

62
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,335
Let's go.

63
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,344
what is that? Are those two dating?

64
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,353
Episode 4~Part 1~

65
00:03:54,354 --> 00:03:59,359
Hasn't she come yet? Could something happened to her?

66
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,413
Sorry, my friend.

67
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:20,420
Oh, that car looks same as Kang Hwi's car.

68
00:04:24,424 --> 00:04:28,428
Today, don't think about anything.

69
00:04:28,428 --> 00:04:30,430
Thank you, Kang Hwi.

70
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,432
You're going to the shop tomorrow, right?

71
00:04:32,432 --> 00:04:34,434
I must. By finding it somehow

72
00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:36,436
Call when you go, I'll go with you.

73
00:04:36,436 --> 00:04:38,438
No, I can go alone.

74
00:04:38,438 --> 00:04:40,440
I have no schedules tomorrow.

75
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,441
I was going to go shopping tomorrow anyway.

76
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:43,443
It's a good thing, go with me.

77
00:04:43,443 --> 00:04:47,447
See Kang Hwi,  you needn't.

78
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:49,449
Go in, I'm leaving.

79
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,452
- Go back safely. - Yes.

80
00:04:53,453 --> 00:04:57,457
Forget about the watch for now and sleep tight, alright?

81
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,050
Yes.

82
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:21,521
What is this? Confess truthfully!

83
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:26,526
The guy before, he wouldn't be my Kang Hwi oppa, right?

84
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,530
It is your oppa.

85
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,538
Hey! Don't joke around with me and tell me the truth.

86
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,540
How could you be coming with my oppa?

87
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,544
Ah! You said you saw everything. He is indeed your oppa!

88
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,547
Why? How could he be my oppa?

89
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:51,551
How can a commoner like you be with my oppa?

90
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:55,555
Don't leave anything out and tell clearly in detail.

91
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:59,559
And in detail, so that I can comprehend the situation!

92
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,062
I am the stylist for Take One.

93
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:03,063
Stylist?

94
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:06,066
You? How?

95
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,068
It just happened somehow.

96
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,610
Ah! You're frustrating. Tell me properly!

97
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,614
Later let's talk later.I'm really tired now. Go now.

98
00:06:14,614 --> 00:06:16,616
When later? Jang Man Ok...

99
00:06:16,616 --> 00:06:18,618
I'm feeling immensely betrayed by you!

100
00:06:18,618 --> 00:06:22,622
You see Kang Hwi oppa's face every day and how could you not tell me a word about it? Huh?

101
00:06:22,622 --> 00:06:24,624
It's not been too long since I started and I was out of my mind.

102
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:27,627
Still, this is such an important thing!

103
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:29,629
Mom and I didn't even know that...

104
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:33,633
and we were so worried that you might be suffering somewhere

105
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:36,636
For someone who said you worried, how could you not give a single call?

106
00:06:38,638 --> 00:06:41,641
That... I did that all for you.

107
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:45,645
Then for me, please leave. Huh? Let me get some sleep!

108
00:06:48,648 --> 00:06:51,651
Jang Man Ok!

109
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:53,653
Hey! Jang Man Ok!

110
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:07,077
Pain in the Ass For My Entire Life

111
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:10,710
Ah! Seriously! Han Ga Ryeong!

112
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:44,744
<I>Subtitles brought to you by The Maid of House 2 Team @ Viki.

113
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:55,755
What more has come up?

114
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:11,811
Tae Ik oppa said that he will take a verification photo in the pajamas and put it up on the fan cafe. I'm so looking forward to it.

115
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:27,827
I will just take one photo Just one

116
00:08:45,845 --> 00:08:47,847
Huh? Huh?

117
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:53,853
First, give me the watches.

118
00:09:02,092 --> 00:09:05,095
Then this

119
00:09:14,914 --> 00:09:17,917
She turns her phone off in this situation?

120
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:21,921
Ah! I don't know, I don't know it isn't even my business.

121
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:34,934
What is thus? What is this guy?

122
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:37,937
How could he call all night long?

123
00:09:38,938 --> 00:09:40,940
Wow! He sent a text at 3 a.m. at dawn?

124
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,942
How dare you turn off your cell?

125
00:09:42,942 --> 00:09:44,944
If you see this, call immediately!

126
00:09:44,944 --> 00:09:47,947
If you don't want to regret it, it would be good to call quickly, Stylist Jang!

127
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:52,952
Ah! Seriously! This rude bastard! What does he want to make me do now?

128
00:09:53,953 --> 00:09:58,958
I'm sorry but today I'm really busy!

129
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,103
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

130
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,105
I requested so much, but if you do this, it is problematic.

131
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:09,109
Can't you wait just one more day, please? Just one more day!

132
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,101
Instead, if you can't return it by tomorrow,

133
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:14,101
you must take the responsibility and compensate for it.

134
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:18,101
Thank you. Thank you very much.

135
00:10:18,101 --> 00:10:20,102
But can you find it?

136
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:24,102
It is such an expensive product, that if someone saw it, he would have taken it immediately.

137
00:10:24,102 --> 00:10:26,102
I must find it somehow.

138
00:10:28,102 --> 00:10:31,103
But if...

139
00:10:31,103 --> 00:10:35,103
by chance... I can't find it, how much do I have to compensate?

140
00:10:35,103 --> 00:10:37,103
You can pay for its actual price.

141
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,103
30 million won.

142
00:10:39,103 --> 00:10:40,104
30 million won?

143
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:42,104
Sh! Be quiet!

144
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:44,104
Oh goodness!

145
00:10:44,104 --> 00:10:46,104
How can a watch be that expensive?

146
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,104
I already told you.

147
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:52,105
It is an highly-priced watch that normal people don't even get to see.

148
00:10:52,105 --> 00:10:54,105
That

149
00:10:55,105 --> 00:10:57,105
I will buy that watch.

150
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:01,111
I will pay for the watch.

151
00:11:04,114 --> 00:11:04,114
Are you crazy?

152
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:07,117
Why? I earn a lot of money.

153
00:11:07,117 --> 00:11:08,118
I can pay for that.

154
00:11:08,118 --> 00:11:10,111
Still, this isn't right.

155
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:12,111
What?

156
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:14,111
I was at fault.  Why would you pay for it instead?

157
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:16,111
It's weird.

158
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:18,111
There's nothing weird about it.

159
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,112
If you think about it, I'm also at fault.

160
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:24,112
If I hadn't joked around back then, you wouldn't have vacated the waiting area.

161
00:11:24,112 --> 00:11:26,112
Then you wouldn't have lost the watch.

162
00:11:26,112 --> 00:11:28,112
So, I'm also at fault.

163
00:11:28,112 --> 00:11:32,113
Anyway, it is my responsibility, so I will take care of it.

164
00:11:32,113 --> 00:11:34,113
Don't bother about it, Kang Hwi.

165
00:11:34,113 --> 00:11:37,113
Why? I want to help.

166
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,114
Strangely, Man Ok, you seem familiar.

167
00:11:40,114 --> 00:11:42,114
You even saved me when we first met.

168
00:11:42,114 --> 00:11:44,114
Ah that was

169
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:48,114
You don't know this, right? You look exactly like the girl I used to like.

170
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:51,115
What? Me?

171
00:11:51,115 --> 00:11:54,115
Yes. You look exactly like my first love.

172
00:11:57,115 --> 00:12:01,121
Whatever, if you have anything to request, you have to ask me first, alright?

173
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,122
You must! Alright?

174
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,124
Yes.

175
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:07,127
Uh? What is this? Are you touched?

176
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,121
Thank you.

177
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:13,121
Really, there is only you.

178
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:15,121
Hey this is nothing.

179
00:12:15,121 --> 00:12:18,121
If you get to know me, I am a more touching person.

180
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:26,122
Eventually, you aren't going to call, is that it?

181
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:28,122
That's fine with me.

182
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,123
I am in no hurry at all.

183
00:12:32,123 --> 00:12:33,123
It is slightly chilly, right?

184
00:12:34,123 --> 00:12:35,123
Oh!

185
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,123
Hey!

186
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:42,124
What are you doing like a village ahjussi? Where did you get that dowdy hat?

187
00:12:42,124 --> 00:12:43,124
I see that the two of you went somewhere together.

188
00:12:43,124 --> 00:12:45,124
What's it to you what others do?

189
00:12:45,124 --> 00:12:47,124
Why? Are you curious?

190
00:12:47,124 --> 00:12:48,124
Not at all.

191
00:12:48,124 --> 00:12:50,125
I'm sorry I couldn't call.

192
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,125
I was running around because of the watch.

193
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,125
Hey, that's alright. You needn't report everything to him.

194
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,125
Anyway, he isn't even bothered.

195
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,125
Of course.

196
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,125
Why should I be bothered?

197
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,130
It isn't even my business.

198
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:05,135
See! His consideration for others is less than the Achilles tendon of an ant.

199
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:07,137
Don't be bothered about that kind of guy and let's go in.

200
00:13:11,131 --> 00:13:12,131
Wait!

201
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:17,131
Hey! Put those scissors away.

202
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:18,131
Why?

203
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,132
Not you...

204
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,132
But Stylist Jang.

205
00:13:23,132 --> 00:13:25,132
So, why?

206
00:13:25,132 --> 00:13:28,132
I have some business with Stylist Jang. What?

207
00:13:28,132 --> 00:13:30,133
Do you have a problem?

208
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:39,133
Cut this. Prettily!

209
00:13:44,134 --> 00:13:48,134
By any chance...Did you call me last night because of this?

210
00:13:52,135 --> 00:13:54,135
Don't you think this is too much?

211
00:13:54,135 --> 00:13:57,135
Wow! How could the two of you be so different?

212
00:13:57,135 --> 00:14:01,141
Sir Kang Hwi even came with me to the shop because he was worried.

213
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,143
What is this, Mr. Lee Tae Ik?

214
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:07,147
Why is one Sir and the other Mister'?

215
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:10,141
Why? Why don't you ask that great Sir to find the watch for you?

216
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:13,141
That is my job.

217
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:16,141
Ah! Is that so?

218
00:14:16,141 --> 00:14:19,141
If you can't find the watch, you will have to compensate for it

219
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:21,142
Do you have the money?

220
00:14:21,142 --> 00:14:23,142
You wouldn't have any regardless of whether I ask you or not.

221
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:28,142
See, if you had left when I told you to, this wouldn't have happened.

222
00:14:34,143 --> 00:14:36,143
Hey, what is this? Do you know how much this is?

223
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,143
I won't do it! I won't!

224
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:41,144
I'm a stylist, not a gardener.

225
00:14:41,144 --> 00:14:43,144
Why do you make me do things like this also?

226
00:14:43,144 --> 00:14:45,144
Since you aren't good at being a stylist, I have to make you do this kind of thing.

227
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:48,144
Who's the one who created big trouble as soon as she started work?

228
00:14:50,145 --> 00:14:52,145
If you say that you will leave immediately today,

229
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:55,145
I will take care of the watch problem somehow.

230
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:55,145
That's alright!

231
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:59,145
I will never break the contract first and leave.

232
00:14:59,145 --> 00:15:01,151
If you can't find the watch, you must leave.

233
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,152
That is also a violation of the contract.

234
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:05,155
I will find it. It will do if I find it, right?

235
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:09,159
I guarantee you that you'll never find it. Never!

236
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,151
Hey! Where are you going?

237
00:15:15,151 --> 00:15:16,151
To find the watch!

238
00:15:25,152 --> 00:15:28,152
I asked all the staff to check everywhere, but I don't think it is here.

239
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:39,153
Why?

240
00:15:39,153 --> 00:15:40,154
Did you find the watch?

241
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:42,154
There is no way you could have found it.

242
00:15:42,154 --> 00:15:44,154
I'm busy now, I'm going to hang up.

243
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:46,154
Stylist Jang! Hey! Stylist Jang!

244
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:49,154
Ah! Why?

245
00:15:49,154 --> 00:15:51,155
Come here running when I say it nicely.

246
00:15:51,155 --> 00:15:52,155
I'll give you just one hour.

247
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,155
Ah, seriously! This rude bastard!

248
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:04,164
Here!

249
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,168
Ah! But, why is she still not coming?

250
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,161
See if you are even one minute late!

251
00:16:12,161 --> 00:16:14,161
Lee Tae Ik, let me use the sauna.

252
00:16:14,161 --> 00:16:16,161
Hey! How did you get in here?

253
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:18,161
Huh? The door was open.

254
00:16:18,161 --> 00:16:19,161
Let me use the sauna.

255
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:21,162
It wasn't made for you to use.

256
00:16:21,162 --> 00:16:24,162
I will pay for this month's electricity bill. Don't be so cheap.

257
00:16:27,162 --> 00:16:28,162
Oh!

258
00:16:28,162 --> 00:16:29,162
What is this?

259
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:31,163
Hey!

260
00:16:31,163 --> 00:16:33,163
What is this? Why is this here?

261
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:37,163
No way Did you pocket this?

262
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,163
No, I didn't.

263
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,164
Hey! The evidence is right here. How can you say that it isn't?

264
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:44,164
Wow! Lee Tae Ik, seriously! I didn't think you were like that.

265
00:16:44,164 --> 00:16:45,164
I told you that it isn't.

266
00:16:45,164 --> 00:16:46,164
How dare you think of me like this?

267
00:16:46,164 --> 00:16:47,164
Give it to me!

268
00:16:47,164 --> 00:16:49,164
I will put it back where it was.

269
00:16:51,165 --> 00:16:56,165
But why didn't you say anything to Man Ok earlier, when you had this?

270
00:16:57,165 --> 00:16:58,165
That is I

271
00:16:58,165 --> 00:17:02,172
By any chance, were you purposely trying to give Man Ok a hard time?

272
00:17:03,173 --> 00:17:06,176
Hey! When did I?

273
00:17:06,176 --> 00:17:09,179
Look at you! Look at you! Your face has become red!

274
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,171
You were trying to get rid of her using this as an excuse, right?

275
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:13,171
Hey!

276
00:17:13,171 --> 00:17:14,171
How could you think of something like that?

277
00:17:14,171 --> 00:17:15,171
Am I you?

278
00:17:15,171 --> 00:17:18,171
Then what is it? Tell me, huh? Tell me.

279
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:25,172
Stylist Jang is here. Please open the door.

280
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:28,172
You're caught in the act. Man Ok!

281
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,173
Won Kang Hwi!

282
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:31,173
Don't do it!

283
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:33,173
Ah, why?

284
00:17:33,173 --> 00:17:36,173
Do you know how much our Man Ok suffered emotionally because of you?

285
00:17:36,173 --> 00:17:37,173
Things like this need to be revealed completely.

286
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:43,174
What Lee Tae Ik, a Hallyu star, did against a powerless stylist needs to be told to the whole world.

287
00:17:43,174 --> 00:17:45,174
Stop with the nonsense!

288
00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:47,174
I'm warning you.

289
00:17:47,174 --> 00:17:49,174
I don't think you are in a position to warn Sir Me, now.

290
00:17:49,174 --> 00:17:51,175
Why don't you move aside?

291
00:17:51,175 --> 00:17:55,175
Hey! Yes, yes The watch... I was going to return it.

292
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:56,175
But Stylist Jang

293
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,175
What about me?

294
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,182
Hey! How did you come in?

295
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:04,184
The door was open.

296
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:07,187
Hey! I told you the door was open.

297
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:07,187
Hi, Man Ok.

298
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:11,181
I would have come earlier if I had known Kang Hwi was here.

299
00:18:13,181 --> 00:18:15,181
What is it that you have to say to me?

300
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:16,181
Huh?

301
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:18,181
You asked me to come running because you had something to say to me.

302
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,182
Tae Ik said that he will solve the watch problem for you.

303
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:24,182
What?

304
00:18:24,182 --> 00:18:24,182
Really?

305
00:18:24,182 --> 00:18:28,182
It's the truth. So, you needn't worry about it anymore.

306
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:32,183
Suddenly What are you saying?

307
00:18:32,183 --> 00:18:34,183
You aren't playing a joke on me by any chance, right?

308
00:18:34,183 --> 00:18:36,183
What joke?

309
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:43,184
Hey! Lee Tae Ik, the Hallyu star, thinks so much of his family, he wouldn't play a joke like that.

310
00:18:43,184 --> 00:18:44,184
Isn't that true?

311
00:18:45,184 --> 00:18:46,184
That's right.

312
00:18:46,184 --> 00:18:49,184
I don't play silly jokes like somebody.

313
00:18:50,185 --> 00:18:51,185
Here.

314
00:18:51,185 --> 00:18:53,185
Ta da!

315
00:18:53,185 --> 00:18:54,185
Oh!

316
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:59,185
How did you find this?

317
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:01,191
See, what happened was Tae I

318
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:04,194
Hey.Aren't you taking a sauna?

319
00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:06,196
C... can I?

320
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:10,191
Continuously from now on?

321
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,191
Yes.

322
00:19:26,192 --> 00:19:30,193
Ga Ryeong. Till when do we have to be like this?

323
00:19:31,193 --> 00:19:32,193
Wait a bit.

324
00:19:32,193 --> 00:19:34,193
Didn't you hear what the part-time employee said earlier?

325
00:19:34,193 --> 00:19:37,193
That swindler is a regular here.

326
00:19:37,193 --> 00:19:40,194
A culprit definitely returns to the (crime) scene.

327
00:19:41,194 --> 00:19:42,194
No. No. (in French)

328
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:44,194
Nora thinks differently.

329
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:46,194
The swindler is not an idiot.

330
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:49,194
Since we could be waiting here, would he come back here?

331
00:19:49,194 --> 00:19:51,195
- Is that so? - Yes <I>(in French)

332
00:19:51,195 --> 00:19:55,195
Just waiting here is...

333
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,195
Stupid! It's a stupid thing to do.

334
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:04,204
We don't know his name or his phone number. How do we find him?

335
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,207
I shouldn't have heard about the press card.

336
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,209
Where on earth did they get the press cards from? They went in so easily.

337
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:12,201
Press card! Ga Ryeong, I thought of something!

338
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:14,201
What?

339
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:17,201
It is a really important thing.

340
00:20:17,201 --> 00:20:20,202
If that man comes, please give him this memo.

341
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:22,202
Excuse me, this is a little

342
00:20:24,202 --> 00:20:26,202
What? You need to drive.

343
00:20:26,202 --> 00:20:31,203
Non! This is a bribeno, a present.

344
00:20:33,203 --> 00:20:37,203
Nora, you seem not to know, but these things

345
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,204
I just have to convey this to him, right?

346
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:44,204
We have to catch that rat-like creature.

347
00:20:44,204 --> 00:20:46,204
This rat-like creature!

348
00:20:48,204 --> 00:20:50,205
- So Ji Seung! This rat-like creature! - Hyung!

349
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:52,205
That rat!

350
00:20:52,205 --> 00:20:56,205
Where are you going! Catch him!

351
00:21:02,212 --> 00:21:03,213
Where did he go?

352
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:04,214
Welcome!

353
00:21:12,211 --> 00:21:13,211
Aigo! Shocks!

354
00:21:14,211 --> 00:21:17,211
I'm paying for this.  My throat is a little dry

355
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:28,212
Thank you for last time. We went in safely because of you.

356
00:21:28,212 --> 00:21:31,213
Can I get 3 more this time?

357
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:33,213
My friends made a request

358
00:21:33,213 --> 00:21:36,213
Please call me!

359
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,213
I guess they luckily didn't get caught.

360
00:21:40,214 --> 00:21:41,214
Didn't they check?

361
00:21:47,214 --> 00:21:50,215
Ah! I can't hand these out randomly

362
00:21:50,215 --> 00:21:53,215
what are the names of your friends?

363
00:21:53,215 --> 00:21:56,215
A million won per person, total 3 million, you know, right?

364
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,215
Swindler! Bastard!

365
00:21:58,215 --> 00:22:02,222
Hey! What are you doing?

366
00:22:02,222 --> 00:22:04,224
How dare you rob the money of a fan?

367
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:07,227
Return our money when we say it nicely.

368
00:22:07,227 --> 00:22:08,228
Ah! Just a moment! Just a moment! Ah!

369
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:09,229
I...

370
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:12,221
Man Ok Kwan, affiliated to the Korean Hapkido Association and which boasts a 50 years tradition...

371
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:14,221
I am the best friend of Jang Man Ok, the master of Man Ok Kwan.

372
00:22:14,221 --> 00:22:17,221
How dare you con us?

373
00:22:17,221 --> 00:22:20,222
I'll give it... I will give it to you, so first release this hand

374
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:23,222
Oh! And you, out down the camera!

375
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:25,222
Ga Ryoeng, don't release him, what if he deceives us again?

376
00:22:25,222 --> 00:22:28,222
I won't. I won't. This time, it's the truth.

377
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:31,223
Ah, really, it hurts listen to me.

378
00:22:31,223 --> 00:22:34,223
Hey! If it is the 3 of us, we can even set up a company.

379
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:37,223
Then you will get press cards and everything

380
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:41,224
And you can go to all the showcases or whatever that you like.

381
00:22:41,224 --> 00:22:42,224
Really?

382
00:22:42,224 --> 00:22:43,224
Vrai?

383
00:22:43,224 --> 00:22:44,224
Yes, really.

384
00:22:45,224 --> 00:22:48,224
Yes, Kang Hwi.

385
00:22:48,224 --> 00:22:51,225
I took care of it well.

386
00:22:51,225 --> 00:22:54,225
No, I'm at home

387
00:22:54,225 --> 00:22:58,225
Yes, Kang Hwi, I'll see you tomorrow.

388
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:03,233
Oh! Shocks!

389
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:08,238
See you tomorrow. Kang Hwi, you, too.

390
00:23:08,238 --> 00:23:11,231
Why are you getting surprised? Are you guilty of something to me?

391
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:13,231
Hey! What guilt?

392
00:23:13,231 --> 00:23:19,231
My friend. Should we have an in-depth conversation in awhile?

393
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,232
I signed an agreement.

394
00:23:22,232 --> 00:23:23,232
Agreement?

395
00:23:23,232 --> 00:23:24,232
What agreement?

396
00:23:24,232 --> 00:23:29,232
Not to tell anything about the lodgment.

397
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:31,233
Really?

398
00:23:31,233 --> 00:23:35,233
Then you really can't tell anybody.

399
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:39,233
They say that there are many people who compensate a huge amount because they broke that.

400
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:40,234
Yes.

401
00:23:40,234 --> 00:23:41,234
I plan on not saying anything.

402
00:23:41,234 --> 00:23:44,234
I will also never tell anybody,

403
00:23:44,234 --> 00:23:50,235
so friend, just tell me slightly. Slightly..

404
00:23:51,235 --> 00:23:53,235
Hey! Han Ga Ryeong!

405
00:23:55,235 --> 00:23:59,235
- Oh! It's grandfather! Volume up! Volume! - Volume?

406
00:23:59,235 --> 00:24:02,242
Yes, grandfather.

407
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:06,246
Of course we were obviously in training now.

408
00:24:06,246 --> 00:24:08,248
Ay! Ay! Ay!

409
00:24:08,248 --> 00:24:10,241
The kids are so diligent.

410
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:13,241
Yab! Yab! Ay! Ay!

411
00:24:13,241 --> 00:24:17,241
Yes, grandfather, don't worry. Come back safely.

412
00:24:24,242 --> 00:24:26,242
Bad girl!

413
00:24:26,242 --> 00:24:32,243
I even shouted along, you can't even tell me that? You completely have no loyalty.

414
00:24:36,243 --> 00:24:39,243
Nora, speed up! We can never lose her today.

415
00:24:39,243 --> 00:24:42,244
Yes, let's go <I> (in French)

416
00:24:50,245 --> 00:24:53,245
Why are you stopping?

417
00:24:53,245 --> 00:24:59,245
No, no! In Paris, you must yield first. We are next.

418
00:24:59,245 --> 00:25:02,252
You don't know the basics of tailing after someone.

419
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:03,253
Huh?

420
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:09,259
Ah! That pain!

421
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:22,252
Why is she going round and round? I'm getting car sick

422
00:25:49,254 --> 00:25:50,255
Take One, rehearsal starts.

423
00:25:50,255 --> 00:25:51,255
It's all the same.

424
00:25:51,255 --> 00:25:57,255
From the beginning of the 2nd verse, Tae Ik come to the middle, Kang Hwi come to the center from the left.

425
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:00,260
Kang Hwi, come forward.

426
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:04,264
Kang Hwi, are you alright?

427
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:07,267
What's the matter? Are you alright?

428
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:09,269
Yes. It's nothing.

429
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:11,261
Today we are singing live on live telecast, will you be alright?

430
00:26:11,261 --> 00:26:12,261
You aren't able to concentrate from before.

431
00:26:12,261 --> 00:26:14,261
Are you alright? Hyung?

432
00:26:14,261 --> 00:26:18,261
I think my lens disappeared.

433
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:19,261
I will go out briefly.

434
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:23,262
I'm sorry, just a moment.

435
00:26:26,262 --> 00:26:29,262
Tell them we will do it by AR.

436
00:26:47,264 --> 00:26:49,264
Why am I like this?

437
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:11,271
If you are going to say hi, do it properly, or just act like you didn't see me.

438
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:16,271
Hello.

439
00:27:16,271 --> 00:27:17,271
Uh, yes.

440
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:23,272
You heard that I am doing the sports drink commercial which you were doing, right?

441
00:27:23,272 --> 00:27:25,272
What to do because I am sorry?

442
00:27:25,272 --> 00:27:30,273
But that company was looking for a fresh image.

443
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:34,273
They are looking for a new face to represent the company.

444
00:27:34,273 --> 00:27:37,273
Fresh?

445
00:27:37,273 --> 00:27:38,273
I guess you don't even look at the mirror?

446
00:27:38,273 --> 00:27:41,274
Or you act like you don't know even if you do.

447
00:27:41,274 --> 00:27:44,274
Change your hair salon. Or change your stylist.

448
00:27:44,274 --> 00:27:46,274
Aren't you fed up of being called a fake Won Kang Hwi?

449
00:27:46,274 --> 00:27:49,274
If it was me, I would feel completely bad.

450
00:27:53,275 --> 00:27:55,275
Ah, right!

451
00:27:55,275 --> 00:27:59,275
That commercial, I'm going to keep doing it.

452
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:04,284
It tasted so bad, so I was going to quit. But they said that they would raise my contract fee by two-folds.

453
00:28:04,284 --> 00:28:07,287
If I knew you were going to do it, I would have told them that I'm not going to do it.

454
00:28:07,287 --> 00:28:08,288
Sorry!

455
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:10,281
Don't be disappointed,

456
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:12,281
if they need a new look, they'll look for you again.

457
00:28:12,281 --> 00:28:15,281
Because you are fresh.

458
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:17,281
Right?

459
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:19,281
Work hard!

460
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,282
Aish!

461
00:28:23,282 --> 00:28:25,282
Ah! Aish!

462
00:30:48,304 --> 00:31:01,311
Subtitles brought to you by the Maid of the House 2 team at viki.com

463
00:31:03,313 --> 00:31:05,315
Hey! Seriously? Are you happy?

464
00:31:05,315 --> 00:31:07,317
Do you not know that I can't use anything?

465
00:31:07,317 --> 00:31:11,311
Did you ever hear that you hurt your eye slightly when you were a kid?

466
00:31:11,311 --> 00:31:14,311
Dogs, cats, rabbits... I hate things like that the most.

467
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:16,311
Omo! Oh my!

468
00:31:16,311 --> 00:31:20,312
Hey, Lee Tae Ik, how could you work with a person of such low standards?

469
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,312
Stylist Jang!

470
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:26,312
Tae Ik hyung's cell is turned off. And Stylist Jang won't pick up.

471
00:31:26,312 --> 00:31:27,312
Get me out.

472
00:31:27,312 --> 00:31:29,312
Say, "Please get me out."

473
00:31:29,312 --> 00:31:30,313
Are you crazy!

474
00:31:30,313 --> 00:31:33,313
Tae Ik!

475
00:31:34,313 --> 00:31:36,313
Are you asking me to sleep outside?

476
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:40,314
If sleep together and get into a scandal, will you take responsibility?
