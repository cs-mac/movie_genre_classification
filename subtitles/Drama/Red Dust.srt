1
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:43,146
I thought so!
This flow isn't worth a dime!

2
00:01:43,564 --> 00:01:45,435
I told you Guidon
tapped them too young.

3
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:48,500
It'll take three years with the best
of care to get them back in shape.

4
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,838
Guidon, that squealing liar!

5
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,318
Before he left, he told me he'd
cleaned out all the bamboo in 347.

6
00:01:54,675 --> 00:01:57,325
- Yes, he did.
- We could use some rain.

7
00:01:57,386 --> 00:02:00,611
The rains will just flood us rotten if
those drain ditches aren't finished.

8
00:02:01,974 --> 00:02:03,564
And look at those slugs!

9
00:02:25,164 --> 00:02:27,453
That's another one of
Guidon's finished jobs.

10
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,763
Whining for leave
when I'm shorthanded.

11
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:31,816
I knew he'd overstay it.

12
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,200
He would have come up
on today's boat, sure.

13
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:38,156
Yeah? He tells me any more of his
lies, and I'm gonna kick in his face.

14
00:02:38,594 --> 00:02:40,011
Not that, Denny.

15
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:42,473
It's hard enough for a man
to breathe up here as it is.

16
00:02:43,474 --> 00:02:46,273
Here she comes, for fare!

17
00:02:59,365 --> 00:03:00,971
That roof'll go in a minute!

18
00:03:28,503 --> 00:03:29,953
Here's Limey.

19
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,409
Hey, did you bring Guidon?

20
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,929
Yes, I dropped him.

21
00:03:39,964 --> 00:03:41,946
He's home to stay all right.

22
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:45,152
The prodigal is returned.

23
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:47,343
He's got a lot of nimble
explaining to do.

24
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:02,170
Maybe he's already pawned in here. ?

25
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:07,493
These dust storms...

26
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:10,793
are something like the fogs
off the coast of Labrador

27
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:15,850
Only the result is different.

28
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:19,156
Hold up a whole day's distilling.

29
00:04:20,115 --> 00:04:22,495
Tomorrow, you and Guidon
take a clearing squad

30
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:36,275
Mr. Guidon come back,
him very happy see me.

31
00:04:36,845 --> 00:04:38,722
Me hit like hell to see him.

32
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:51,386
Grab his feet.

33
00:04:56,594 --> 00:04:58,454
Smells like he could have
been drinking benzene.

34
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:01,503
At that, he'd sell pretty
well in the States,

35
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:05,290
if you put a label on his chest
and  sealed up both ends.

36
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:07,767
All right...Heave!

37
00:05:08,586 --> 00:05:10,581
Hey! What's the idea?

38
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:14,331
You poor sap...

39
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:17,032
How many times do I have to
tell you, you haven't a chance of...

40
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:24,109
Well, for the love of mud! Where
am I sleeping, on a race track?

41
00:05:24,244 --> 00:05:26,632
Come on, let's have it. Who are you?
Where'd you come from?

42
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:28,150
Don't rush me, brother.

43
00:05:28,776 --> 00:05:30,998
I'm Pollyanna, the glad girl.

44
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:33,492
I see. Came on up the boat
with him, eh?

45
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:36,158
I came up on the boat,
sure, but not with that.

46
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,895
He was in the steerage,
as far as I was concerned.

47
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:41,759
I thought I had convinced
this drunken...

48
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:42,892
Get him out of here, will you?

49
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,746
Why did you get off the boat at all?

50
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,233
You know it doesn't stop here
again for four weeks, don't you?

51
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:51,610
Sure, I do.
Think I'm overjoyed about it?

52
00:05:51,645 --> 00:05:53,233
But it's just got to be, that's all.

53
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:54,904
- Well then?
- I left the boat here

54
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:57,368
for the same reason I took it
at Saigon. - What reason?

55
00:05:57,592 --> 00:05:59,273
I got mixed up in a little trouble

56
00:05:59,308 --> 00:06:02,399
and I thought I'd stay away out of town
until the gendarmes forgot about it.

57
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:04,549
And what a cast-iron nerve you got!

58
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:06,743
You have to have in my line.

59
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:10,250
But don't worry, big boy,
I'll stay out from under foot.

60
00:06:10,484 --> 00:06:13,868
I'll even pay for my board if
you insist on it nicely.

61
00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:18,468
You're the head man
around here, aren't you?

62
00:06:19,218 --> 00:06:21,729
- Come on, Mac. - You're not
gonna leave the corpse here?

63
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,931
It's his room. Didn't you know?

64
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,129
Honest, I didn't. I just took the first
room the houseboy showed me.

65
00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:28,545
Oh please, you guys.

66
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,695
This place is full of lizards
and cockroaches as it is.

67
00:06:31,921 --> 00:06:33,189
One more won't hurt.

68
00:06:41,697 --> 00:06:45,255
You know, Denny,
she might be able to sew.

69
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,787
I haven't got a pair of pants to my name
with a full set of buttons on them.

70
00:06:49,822 --> 00:06:52,245
It's bad enough having to play
around with them in Saigon,

71
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,780
much less have one in your house.

72
00:06:54,293 --> 00:06:55,587
Not bad-looking.

73
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:57,015
That doesn't change her.

74
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,913
Aha! Beans!

75
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,610
What happened to
that quarter of beef?

76
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,947
You leave the refrigerator
door open again?

77
00:07:03,982 --> 00:07:05,265
Yes, sir, Mr. Denny.

78
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,267
Ice all water.
You don't want the beef now.

79
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:11,384
All stinky! Stinky!

80
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,857
Better eat something, Denny.

81
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:18,813
Yeah, later maybe.

82
00:07:27,023 --> 00:07:29,899
Mac...did you ever want to quit?

83
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:33,373
Oh, sure.
I quit your old man once.

84
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:35,303
When I sobered up in Singapore

85
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:37,276
I saw a Britisher loading rubber,

86
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:38,601
and I turned around and came back.

87
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:43,602
The company's made me a swell offer.

88
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:46,535
I could sell out pretty.
- But you won't.

89
00:07:47,186 --> 00:07:48,986
You was born smelling rubber

90
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:51,447
and sweating to get it
and you'll die that way.

91
00:07:51,482 --> 00:07:52,519
You think so?

92
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:56,355
Do you think I'll spend my
whole life in this dry rot

93
00:07:56,405 --> 00:07:58,752
just so the rest of the world
can ride around on balloon tires?

94
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:00,625
- Sure you will.
- Who says so?

95
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:04,844
Why should I spend the rest of my
days worrying about guys like Guidon?

96
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:07,795
Kicking a herd of crawling
coolies around...

97
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,019
fighting fever...

98
00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:12,610
swallowing dust one month,
wading in mud the next,

99
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:16,230
just so some old woman can take
her hot water bottle to bed with her?

100
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:18,930
Yeah and just as long as
there's one baby in the world

101
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,717
to suck on a rubber nipple.

102
00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:29,179
Now, listen, Dennis, you've got
your yearly case of nerves.

103
00:08:30,272 --> 00:08:31,934
Now why don't you go
down to Saigon and...

104
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:33,306
to blow the lid off?

105
00:08:33,503 --> 00:08:35,138
Get a laugh out of your liquor?

106
00:08:36,068 --> 00:08:39,223
With this outfit running away as it is,
how am I going to get to Saigon?

107
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:43,464
Well, as a matter of fact, what came up
from Saigon isn't so bad-looking.

108
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:47,794
I've been looking at her kind
ever since my voice changed.

109
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:57,775
Let's lay off tomorrow,
and knock that fellow over.

110
00:08:58,485 --> 00:08:59,527
I never got time.

111
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:07,461
Don't mind me, boys.
I'm just restless.

112
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:10,512
Hello, Polly.

113
00:09:10,547 --> 00:09:12,732
I thought you were
going back to sleep.

114
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:16,402
Not with that alley cat
yodelling out there.

115
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:19,181
Guess I'm not used to
sleeping nights anyway.

116
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:22,266
Listen.

117
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:25,714
Tomorrow you and Guidon see about
clearing a road down to that creek area.

118
00:09:25,749 --> 00:09:27,108
I thought you were
going to let that wait

119
00:09:27,143 --> 00:09:29,432
until that new
survey engineer fellow...

120
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:31,333
- You mean Willis?
- Yeah.

121
00:09:31,368 --> 00:09:33,223
He's due on Limey's
next trip up, isn't he?

122
00:09:33,258 --> 00:09:35,038
Yes, but I'm not counting on him.

123
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:37,670
Probably some textbook
ingenue like the last one.

124
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,964
What's Polly's name?

125
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:43,668
She never had one.

126
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:46,530
Well I'll have to tend to that.

127
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:48,509
You can't have a poor
bird without a name.

128
00:09:48,544 --> 00:09:49,889
You just tend to minding
your own business.

129
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:55,611
This place certainly reeks of
hospitality and good cheer.

130
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,155
Or maybe it's this cheese.

131
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:04,835
Oh, gorgonzola!
My favorite tango!

132
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:10,163
Mr. Denny, you no want eat?

133
00:10:10,198 --> 00:10:11,628
No, clear this stuff.

134
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:14,898
You won't grow up to be
a big strong boy like

135
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:17,786
grandpa here if you don't
eat your din-din, Fred.

136
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:22,770
Say listen, Lily, as long as you've got
to use it, the name's Dennis Carson.

137
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:23,850
Okay, Fred.

138
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:26,926
This name is Vantine,
as long as you've got to use it.

139
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:29,101
Don't worry, I won't
have much occasion to.

140
00:10:30,183 --> 00:10:32,533
Nice light-hearted
little fellow, isn't he?

141
00:10:32,568 --> 00:10:34,645
We've had a hard day's
work, Vantine.

142
00:10:35,664 --> 00:10:37,680
What else do you do besides work?

143
00:10:38,393 --> 00:10:39,990
Don't you know any games?

144
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,519
If it was the summer of 1894,
I'd play games with you, sister.

145
00:10:45,508 --> 00:10:47,123
But life is much simpler now.

146
00:10:47,158 --> 00:10:49,290
I bet you painted
your hometown red!

147
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:50,585
I'll say I did.

148
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:52,488
Good night, Denny.

149
00:10:52,523 --> 00:10:54,020
- Good night, Mac.
- Good night.

150
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:07,199
Here... Cut that out
and eat something.

151
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:10,293
You'll just get stewed.
- I never get stewed.

152
00:11:10,328 --> 00:11:12,652
What if I did?
Would it turn your hair gray?

153
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:15,547
No, but it'll put red spots
on your liver.

154
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:17,614
Especially if you don't
eat something.

155
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:21,084
Come on, big boy, I know
you've had a hard day in the office.

156
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:22,167
Get out of here!

157
00:11:22,202 --> 00:11:24,887
Put the rest of that cheese in your
mouth, where it'll do the most good.

158
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,801
I'll go quietly, officer.

159
00:11:52,985 --> 00:11:55,162
That's roquefort,
the other's gorgonzola.

160
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:58,628
- I happen to like roquefort.
- I like gorgonzola.

161
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:01,475
Is there any brand that would
stop you from talking?

162
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,855
I'll order a ton of it.

163
00:12:03,663 --> 00:12:04,990
I'll keep quiet.

164
00:12:06,469 --> 00:12:09,302
You know you wouldn't like roquefort
if you knew the way it was made.

165
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:12,601
They've got a whole town that does nothing
but make roquefort somewhere in France.

166
00:12:12,736 --> 00:12:14,670
I was reading about it
the other day.

167
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,019
It comes from sheep's milk,
did you know that?

168
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,949
And they do the rottenest
things to the sheep...

169
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:21,912
Ewes, don't they call 'em?

170
00:12:22,247 --> 00:12:25,520
Before they milk them, the sheep people
slap them all around underneath

171
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:28,334
to make the milk thicker and
then they put it in a cave and...

172
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:30,899
I don't care where it's made
or who slaps who.

173
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:33,937
All I want you to do...
- You don't have to snarl about it.

174
00:12:33,972 --> 00:12:37,020
There are a lot of people who would be mighty
interested to know how they slap cheese...

175
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:38,686
I'm not interested in cheese.

176
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:43,595
You said you liked roquefort
and I was just telling you

177
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,690
how they slap it out...

178
00:12:44,725 --> 00:12:46,830
You want me to slap you
out of this room?

179
00:12:47,553 --> 00:12:49,452
You and what man's army?

180
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:54,155
If you don't keep quiet I'm gonna
lock you up in one of the outhouses.

181
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,274
What would you think of that?

182
00:12:55,713 --> 00:12:59,244
I'd still like roquefort.
I mean gorgonzola!

183
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:10,273
There, I knew you had
a laugh in you, that's perfect.

184
00:13:10,308 --> 00:13:12,317
Shake and go to the
head of your class.

185
00:13:15,976 --> 00:13:17,818
Now wait a minute, Fred.

186
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,337
Come here.

187
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:22,314
Hey!

188
00:13:24,686 --> 00:13:27,264
You talk too much, but
you're a cute little trick at that.

189
00:13:27,735 --> 00:13:29,352
Why haven't you been around before?

190
00:13:29,957 --> 00:13:31,610
You change your mind quick enough.

191
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:35,290
Your hair's always been that color?

192
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:37,128
Always been a towhead.

193
00:13:37,653 --> 00:13:39,377
And you always shut
your face off that way?

194
00:13:39,412 --> 00:13:40,863
Well, I like that!

195
00:13:48,342 --> 00:13:51,147
Hello, Lily!
Hello, Lily!

196
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:11,122
Well...
Goodbye, Denny.

197
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:13,804
Goodbye, kid.
It's been nice having you.

198
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,297
- Where's the rest of that beer lot?
- Coming up!

199
00:14:16,332 --> 00:14:18,501
Gee, Denny, I don't want
any ceremony but...

200
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:20,613
but...

201
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:24,072
turn around and give me the works.

202
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,550
What?

203
00:14:26,276 --> 00:14:29,911
Oh, I'm forgetting the expenses, huh?

204
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:33,518
Oh, Denny, no.

205
00:14:34,762 --> 00:14:36,229
- What's the matter?
- Please, don't.

206
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:38,045
This wasn't like that.

207
00:14:40,564 --> 00:14:42,944
Where's that fellow, Willis?
Did you bring him?

208
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:45,249
He's in the port cabin.

209
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,910
Here you are, kid.
It isn't half enough.

210
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,834
But when I get down to Saigon,
there'll be more.

211
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:55,182
Keep your chin up.

212
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,050
Willis?

213
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,982
- Mr. Carson?
- Right.

214
00:15:32,293 --> 00:15:33,795
Gary Willis, I take it.

215
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,436
Got any more luggage?

216
00:15:42,128 --> 00:15:43,175
Yes?

217
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:46,596
Babs, this is Mr. Carson.
My wife.

218
00:15:46,873 --> 00:15:48,112
Your who?

219
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:50,392
Mrs. Willis.

220
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,968
- Oh. How do you do?
- Well, thank you.

221
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:56,679
A rather longer trip
than we expected.

222
00:15:58,156 --> 00:16:00,034
What's the matter?
Dizzy?

223
00:16:00,483 --> 00:16:02,635
Gary's been feeling the heat
a little more than usual today.

224
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,095
- Oh, I'm all right.
- Take it up to the house.

225
00:16:06,342 --> 00:16:08,595
Mr. Carson will see that you
run a nice cold tub, darling.

226
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,083
He looks like he's
ready for one himself.

227
00:16:13,012 --> 00:16:14,104
Thanks, dear.

228
00:16:17,782 --> 00:16:19,296
This is Mac, Mr. and Mrs. Willis.

229
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:20,812
How do you do.

230
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,946
This way, lad.
We'll get the duffel up.

231
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,442
My, it's good to be here!
Where's the plantation?

232
00:16:27,902 --> 00:16:29,002
That's it.

233
00:16:29,137 --> 00:16:31,820
- I mean the main house.
- That's it.

234
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,046
Why? Is it a big shock to you?

235
00:16:37,906 --> 00:16:39,944
Well, of course,
I haven't been inside yet.

236
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:42,707
Well, you're a big shock to me.

237
00:16:43,656 --> 00:16:45,045
What do you mean?

238
00:16:45,252 --> 00:16:46,962
I didn't expect you at all.

239
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:51,449
Gary darling, wait a moment.

240
00:16:59,421 --> 00:17:02,008
- Kind of rustic and
pioneering, isn't it? - Yes.

241
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:07,758
- We can't live the rest of our lives in
the bridal suite, darling. - No.

242
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:10,940
But where do you take a bath?

243
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:13,407
Would the lady like to
take a bath? I show you.

244
00:17:19,948 --> 00:17:21,089
See?

245
00:17:22,336 --> 00:17:24,144
Pretty lady just take off clothes.

246
00:17:24,807 --> 00:17:26,556
Hold the water top side of head.

247
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:29,620
Water goes all over.

248
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,305
But isn't there any curtain?

249
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,943
No, no curtain. Take a bath,

250
00:17:35,978 --> 00:17:37,826
talk with people in here, same time.

251
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:41,001
That will be fixed, darling.

252
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:44,305
- Where's our room?
- Follow Hoy.

253
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,279
Nice room, very nice.

254
00:17:46,928 --> 00:17:48,288
Nice room. Very nice.

255
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,018
- That's all.
- All right, me come again.

256
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:04,759
Babs, I didn't know it was
going to be like this.

257
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:07,633
I may as well face it,
this is no place for you.

258
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,370
Here now, any place
is my place, where you are.

259
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,536
And I'll put a curtain
on that bath place,

260
00:18:13,077 --> 00:18:15,735
I'm gonna get a broom, and some
soap and water for this room...

261
00:18:15,989 --> 00:18:17,001
And I'll...

262
00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:19,141
Why darling, what's the matter?

263
00:18:20,347 --> 00:18:23,985
Here now, you're all worried and
hot and excited, all at once,

264
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,787
and that's bad. Take your
coat off and lie down.

265
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:28,824
Heat never hit me like this before.

266
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:30,708
It's gone now.

267
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:37,688
Men think they can stand anything.

268
00:18:38,023 --> 00:18:40,879
Gosh. You think we can
stand this bed?

269
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:44,249
Who else is going to?

270
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:52,879
Pardon me.

271
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,350
I feel like a fool,
landing here this way.

272
00:18:55,963 --> 00:18:59,358
You've no idea how anxious I am
to get started working, Mr. Carson.

273
00:19:00,011 --> 00:19:02,999
Say, there's a great new mulch for
replanting I wanted to talk to you about.

274
00:19:03,034 --> 00:19:04,168
Yes, lie down, will you?

275
00:19:06,987 --> 00:19:08,023
Let me see your tongue.

276
00:19:17,012 --> 00:19:19,335
Say, what's the idea of all this?

277
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,284
That's quinine.
Give him four right away.

278
00:19:23,722 --> 00:19:24,906
And here's a bromide.

279
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:27,558
It will give him a good night's
rest, and he needs that.

280
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:30,330
Here's the thermometer.

281
00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:32,558
Take his temperature every
four hours and let me know.

282
00:19:32,593 --> 00:19:34,547
- Is there anything really
wrong with me? - Yes.

283
00:19:35,136 --> 00:19:36,613
You've got the start of
a good attack of fever.

284
00:19:36,648 --> 00:19:38,076
- Fever?
- Listen Carson, are you...

285
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,803
Now stop getting excited,
both of you.

286
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:41,522
It's the surest way
to help it along.

287
00:19:42,718 --> 00:19:44,232
Get him undressed and
under the covers.

288
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:45,901
You'll pull through
if you follow orders.

289
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:48,883
Mr. Carson.

290
00:19:49,877 --> 00:19:51,543
- I'd like to speak to you
a moment. - Certainly.

291
00:19:51,578 --> 00:19:53,809
- Now, Babs!
- I'll only be a moment, Gary.

292
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:06,441
Mr. Carson, I wonder
if you really...

293
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:19,721
Of course, we must
get a doctor at once.

294
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:22,378
The nearest doctor's in Saigon.

295
00:20:22,982 --> 00:20:24,695
That's three days down
and three back.

296
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:27,919
Then we must go back with the boat.

297
00:20:28,786 --> 00:20:30,843
Frankly, I'd just as soon you did.

298
00:20:31,198 --> 00:20:32,874
But I've got a little conscience left.

299
00:20:33,387 --> 00:20:35,289
He'd likely be dead by the time
you got there.

300
00:20:38,398 --> 00:20:40,234
Now, all I want you to do
is to keep your head.

301
00:20:40,987 --> 00:20:42,365
He'd be burning up
by tomorrow night.

302
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:46,453
But if he's here with me instead of
being bumped about in that cigar box,

303
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:48,007
he'll have a chance.

304
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,832
I've only missed out on a couple,
and I've had dozens.

305
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:02,133
I won't stand for this!

306
00:21:02,656 --> 00:21:05,993
Do you think you can treat Gary
like one of your coolies?

307
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:09,191
Why not? He's just another
worker on the place.

308
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,172
Only he's coming down with the fever
and therefore isn't quite as valuable.

309
00:21:12,344 --> 00:21:14,072
I won't have you talk like that!

310
00:21:14,178 --> 00:21:16,003
I never...
- I know you won't.

311
00:21:16,323 --> 00:21:19,079
The only excuse you have for being
here is to help take care of him.

312
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:23,266
Now get in there and give him that quinine
and take a little yourself while you're at it.

313
00:21:24,086 --> 00:21:25,656
Give him all the water
he wants and more.

314
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:27,575
The china boy will give you
whatever else you need.

315
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,973
You're not going to leave him?

316
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:30,927
You're not going out?

317
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:33,280
Yes. I work here.

318
00:21:33,315 --> 00:21:36,052
You don't expect me to sit
around and hold his hand, do you?

319
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:45,993
All right. If that makes
you feel any better.

320
00:22:26,008 --> 00:22:27,106
What was that?

321
00:22:29,706 --> 00:22:31,017
That was a tiger.

322
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,917
A tiger? He sounded so close.

323
00:22:35,074 --> 00:22:38,697
He just sits out there in the bush
and swears at us every now and then.

324
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:41,491
He won't come within a hundred
yards of the compound.

325
00:22:42,206 --> 00:22:43,671
Now don't give him another thought.

326
00:22:43,832 --> 00:22:46,622
I see. If you're sure he won't.

327
00:22:46,877 --> 00:22:47,944
I...

328
00:22:48,128 --> 00:22:51,011
I 'm sorry about this morniing.
Let me apologize.

329
00:22:51,882 --> 00:22:53,750
It's quite unnecessary, really.

330
00:22:54,301 --> 00:22:57,422
You know, running a plantation
sometimes gets on the nerves.

331
00:22:57,554 --> 00:22:59,060
With your husband arriving sick and

332
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:01,608
wondering just how you were going to
fit into the scheme of things here...

333
00:23:01,643 --> 00:23:02,717
You don't have to explain anything.

334
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,824
All you've got to do
is to get Gary through this.

335
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:09,288
Of course. I need him almost
as badly as you do.

336
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:12,371
You...
gave him that bromide?

337
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:14,378
Yes, he's asleep.

338
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:16,137
Is there anything more I should do?

339
00:23:16,365 --> 00:23:19,398
No, let him sleep as late as he can in
the morning, and I'll look at him then.

340
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:21,890
- I will.
- By the way...

341
00:23:22,496 --> 00:23:25,296
my room is that front
one off the porch,

342
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:27,007
If you should want me
during the night.

343
00:23:27,626 --> 00:23:30,971
- Thank you.
- Are we friends now?

344
00:23:31,941 --> 00:23:34,621
Does that really matter so much
at the moment, Mr. Carson?

345
00:23:36,258 --> 00:23:37,591
Good night.

346
00:23:52,084 --> 00:23:53,677
Lady scared of the cat?

347
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:54,884
Why not?

348
00:23:55,052 --> 00:23:57,009
She probably never thought
of one except in the zoo.

349
00:23:57,484 --> 00:23:58,522
She's beautiful, isn't she?

350
00:23:59,043 --> 00:24:00,077
Very.

351
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:01,904
Only don't start
telling her, will you?

352
00:24:02,461 --> 00:24:04,277
Reserving that privilege
for yourself?

353
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,524
Explain the joke
and I'll die laughing.

354
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:10,699
Somebody would have had
a lot of explaining to do

355
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,665
if she and Vantine had ever met.

356
00:24:12,963 --> 00:24:14,368
What would you have said, Denny?

357
00:24:14,403 --> 00:24:15,561
Called it your sister?

358
00:24:16,028 --> 00:24:18,294
No, we'd have panned her
off better as your governess.

359
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,389
Can you imagine the mixed feminine
population we would have had then?

360
00:24:22,424 --> 00:24:24,872
That's one trouble we
haven't got, so let's forget it.

361
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:26,659
She's gone and...
- Hi there!

362
00:24:26,694 --> 00:24:28,248
Hey, you guys still up?

363
00:24:30,843 --> 00:24:32,934
Hey, where's the
reception committee?

364
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:38,593
It's been a nice little walk. Did you
hear that hungry pussycat back there?

365
00:24:38,706 --> 00:24:41,598
I'd begun to feel like
a porterhouse steak.

366
00:24:41,633 --> 00:24:42,652
What's the idea?

367
00:24:42,687 --> 00:24:44,036
I bounced back, that's all.

368
00:24:44,071 --> 00:24:46,158
One month up here and
I turn into a rubber check.

369
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,287
What happened?

370
00:24:47,322 --> 00:24:49,850
You tell him, Admiral. I want
to get away from these eagles.

371
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,636
A disaster, gentlemen.
A blooming disaster.

372
00:24:54,356 --> 00:24:55,808
Well come on, out with it!
Let's have it.

373
00:24:55,843 --> 00:24:57,381
I ain't saying how it happened...

374
00:24:57,828 --> 00:24:59,515
But we got past
the rapids all right.

375
00:25:00,314 --> 00:25:02,772
And I'd just left the bridge
to go down to get a pot of tea

376
00:25:02,807 --> 00:25:05,511
and before you knew it,
that orangatang at the wheel

377
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,413
runs the nose right
in the mud bank.

378
00:25:07,795 --> 00:25:09,045
The current gets her in deeper,

379
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:11,591
and tried to pull her out,
a shaft snaps in two...

380
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:13,454
like a stick of macaroni.

381
00:25:13,489 --> 00:25:16,792
That old shaft's been due to snap
for the last twenty odd years.

382
00:25:16,827 --> 00:25:18,886
That boat's a sister ship
to the Ark!

383
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:20,710
And Noah here couldn't understand

384
00:25:20,778 --> 00:25:23,245
why I wouldn't stay onboard
with a bunch of monkeys.

385
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:26,306
What was the matter
with using the tender?

386
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:27,982
Tender? I'll say it was.

387
00:25:28,017 --> 00:25:30,808
We put it in the water
and the bottom dropped out.

388
00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:32,835
How long is that boat
going to be laid up?

389
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,813
Well, I gotta get a couple of boys
trekking down to Saigon for help,

390
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,771
and by the time I get a new shaft and
propeller in it, it'll be, let me see now...

391
00:25:39,806 --> 00:25:41,611
It'll be at least six weeks,
even if you're lucky.

392
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:43,563
I guess you're right, Mr. Carson.

393
00:25:44,237 --> 00:25:45,730
I'm not lucky this season.

394
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,144
Well, you boys can stay here and
give the story to the papers,

395
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:51,116
I'm gonna drop the
body in the hay.

396
00:25:51,151 --> 00:25:52,192
Just a minute.

397
00:25:53,442 --> 00:25:55,546
You'll be much more
comfortable upstairs.

398
00:25:57,032 --> 00:25:58,585
Willis brought his wife.

399
00:26:00,002 --> 00:26:01,585
Oh, a lady!

400
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:05,994
Now no noise, you understand?

401
00:26:06,696 --> 00:26:08,778
Willis is up to his gills
in the fever.

402
00:26:09,631 --> 00:26:11,951
What a pleasant little house
party this is gonna be!

403
00:26:11,986 --> 00:26:14,358
Never mind about that.
Get upstairs and keep quiet.

404
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:28,089
Me very glad, Miss Van
come back. Very glad.

405
00:26:28,502 --> 00:26:30,506
Hoy old pal, that's nice
to hear from someone,

406
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:32,777
even though you are
slightly simple-minded.

407
00:26:33,127 --> 00:26:35,186
Thank you. I make
new kind of biscuits.

408
00:26:35,221 --> 00:26:36,790
Special for Miss Van.

409
00:26:39,702 --> 00:26:42,093
Say, which tree did
this one ooze out of?

410
00:26:43,238 --> 00:26:46,093
Miss Van tell funny joke!
Oh, funny!

411
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,086
Clear that brush out on 291.

412
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,565
- Hey, Mac!
- Yeah?

413
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,956
That old bullock's gone lame.

414
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:56,974
I'll look after it, Denny.

415
00:26:57,543 --> 00:26:58,651
Gary, don't!

416
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,520
Babs, I'm not sick.

417
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:03,010
If I get up and move around,
and stop thinking about it...

418
00:27:03,045 --> 00:27:05,442
You don't know how sick you are.
Now, please, dear.

419
00:27:05,477 --> 00:27:06,574
Where's Carson?

420
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:08,555
He'll know I'm all right
by just looking at me.

421
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,916
I know, but you can't get up.

422
00:27:09,951 --> 00:27:11,514
You've got to stay in bed.

423
00:27:12,462 --> 00:27:14,784
I'll speak to Mr. Carson and see
what you can have for breakfast.

424
00:27:15,438 --> 00:27:17,218
- All right.
- That's a boy.

425
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:29,121
- Oh! Good morning.
- Hello.

426
00:27:29,156 --> 00:27:32,102
We haven't met but don't let
that stop you if you're hungry.

427
00:27:34,026 --> 00:27:35,270
I was looking for Mr. Carson.

428
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:38,052
He's outside, being noisy
about something or other.

429
00:27:38,087 --> 00:27:41,546
You better sit down and drink your
pinapple juice before it starts cooking.

430
00:27:41,581 --> 00:27:42,958
As you say, we haven't met.

431
00:27:43,331 --> 00:27:44,478
I'm Mrs. Willis.

432
00:27:44,513 --> 00:27:46,374
Yeah I know, they told me
about your husband.

433
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:48,139
How is he today?

434
00:27:48,595 --> 00:27:50,018
I hope we can get a doctor.

435
00:27:50,231 --> 00:27:51,807
Oh, these fool doctors!

436
00:27:51,842 --> 00:27:54,893
Even if you did get one, why, all
he'd do is sit by the side of the bed

437
00:27:54,928 --> 00:27:57,650
and start crabbing the government
for not stamping out fever.

438
00:27:57,685 --> 00:27:59,337
Then they prescribe brandy
and have

439
00:27:59,372 --> 00:28:01,110
to sample themselves
to see if it's any good,

440
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:03,149
and by the time you're
deciding whether to live or die,

441
00:28:03,184 --> 00:28:05,558
they're under the bed
singing "Sweet Adeline"

442
00:28:05,793 --> 00:28:07,526
You seem to be very familiar
with the country.

443
00:28:08,297 --> 00:28:09,188
Are you...

444
00:28:09,598 --> 00:28:11,203
married to one of the men here?

445
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:13,502
Do you think I'd live in
a menagerie like this?

446
00:28:14,028 --> 00:28:16,648
I've been visiting my brother. He
has the next plantation below here,

447
00:28:16,683 --> 00:28:18,019
and it's a lovely place.

448
00:28:18,054 --> 00:28:20,616
You know he copied it from
our old family plantation

449
00:28:20,651 --> 00:28:23,311
in Bluefield, West Virginia.
Have you ever been to Bluefield?

450
00:28:24,466 --> 00:28:25,594
No, I haven't.

451
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:27,147
We're the Jeffersons there.

452
00:28:27,325 --> 00:28:29,002
I'm Vantine Jefferson.

453
00:28:29,303 --> 00:28:31,456
You know, I was supposed to
be happy about staying home

454
00:28:31,491 --> 00:28:33,515
and marrying the son
of another FFB.

455
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:36,817
But I'm just the restless,
adventurous type I guess.

456
00:28:36,852 --> 00:28:39,399
I had to come out to stay with
my brother and see the world.

457
00:28:40,048 --> 00:28:41,444
Then you're visiting here too.

458
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:44,171
Oh no! But how I got here!

459
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,653
Mr. Carson nearly died laughing.

460
00:28:46,688 --> 00:28:49,523
I got on a boat to go down to Saigon,
you know, to do a little shopping?

461
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,071
And the boat turns back to pick up
some elastics or something

462
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,211
and gets stuck in the mud.

463
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:57,522
My dear, and I had to walk
back through the jungle!

464
00:28:57,658 --> 00:29:00,314
Wait'll the folks back in
Richmond hear about this.

465
00:29:02,265 --> 00:29:03,768
Aren't you gonna drink
your pineapple juice?

466
00:29:03,803 --> 00:29:05,912
When Mr. Carson comes in,
will you tell him I want to see him?

467
00:29:06,002 --> 00:29:07,074
Yes, madam.

468
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:08,933
You didn't believe
a word of it, did you?

469
00:29:10,235 --> 00:29:11,503
Did you expect me to?

470
00:29:12,176 --> 00:29:13,334
No.

471
00:29:15,925 --> 00:29:17,974
But there was a guy
on the next plantation,

472
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:19,508
even though he wasn't my brother.

473
00:29:19,527 --> 00:29:21,748
and that story about
the boat's all true, see?

474
00:29:21,883 --> 00:29:23,614
I haven't any connection
here at all,

475
00:29:24,016 --> 00:29:25,413
whether you believe it or not.

476
00:29:31,163 --> 00:29:34,318
Why Denny, you're all shaved
and dressed up fancy!

477
00:29:36,954 --> 00:29:38,121
You even smell good.

478
00:29:38,256 --> 00:29:39,351
What have you been telling her?

479
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:41,624
You don't think I'd...

480
00:29:42,563 --> 00:29:45,000
Say, I know when to keep
my mouth shut. - I hope so.

481
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,711
I merely said I came
from the next plantation

482
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:49,138
and the boat broke down.

483
00:29:49,215 --> 00:29:51,043
She'll believe that
if you'll back me up.

484
00:29:51,134 --> 00:29:53,094
I don't want to crawl in and
dirty up her goldfish bowl.

485
00:29:53,129 --> 00:29:55,154
Now listen, this woman's decent.

486
00:29:55,189 --> 00:29:57,659
You watch your language and stop
running around here half-naked.

487
00:29:57,694 --> 00:30:00,326
- I'll stay as comfortable as I like.
- You'll go back to Saigon.

488
00:30:00,561 --> 00:30:02,941
On what? That speedboat
stuck in the mud?

489
00:30:02,976 --> 00:30:04,912
No. Slung in a hammock
through the bush.

490
00:30:05,698 --> 00:30:07,052
Oh, I see.

491
00:30:07,268 --> 00:30:11,002
Two weeks in the swamp playing tag
with your trusted coolies at night.

492
00:30:11,586 --> 00:30:13,160
I guess that would be
good enough for me.

493
00:30:13,195 --> 00:30:15,242
You can keep your mouth shut
and keep out of the way.

494
00:30:15,824 --> 00:30:17,612
Pretty lady want see Mr. Denny.

495
00:30:17,647 --> 00:30:19,011
All right.
Now remember what I said.

496
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,920
Say, Denny.

497
00:30:22,443 --> 00:30:23,470
What?

498
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:26,573
Oh, nothing. You look
kind of cute, that's all.

499
00:30:31,521 --> 00:30:34,031
Gary, I told you not to get up.
You shouldn't.

500
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:35,455
Come in!

501
00:30:36,465 --> 00:30:39,413
He insisted on getting up.
- Not obeying orders, eh?

502
00:30:39,743 --> 00:30:41,372
Hoy! Bring me some blankets,
snap into it!

503
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,545
Gosh! What hit me?

504
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:47,094
Fever chills. You've got to get
used to them for a couple of days.

505
00:30:47,527 --> 00:30:48,985
Get me a coat, anything.

506
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,882
- Denny, can I help?
- Yes, tell Mac to go on out.

507
00:30:56,126 --> 00:30:58,151
- Get me the medicine box, Hoy.
- Yes, sir.

508
00:31:09,989 --> 00:31:11,498
You won't leave him now, will you?

509
00:31:11,852 --> 00:31:13,032
You'll stay?

510
00:31:13,951 --> 00:31:16,012
Naturally.
There are things to be done.

511
00:31:18,491 --> 00:31:20,448
Come on, boy, dig in your heels.

512
00:32:04,224 --> 00:32:05,318
Here.

513
00:32:07,112 --> 00:32:08,527
Hi, Doc.

514
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,030
How am I doing?

515
00:32:12,573 --> 00:32:14,287
Great. Eat your spinach.

516
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:16,033
The rest of your milk.

517
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,158
All of it now.

518
00:32:41,549 --> 00:32:44,178
Well, it looks as though
you were gonna stay married.

519
00:32:45,249 --> 00:32:46,581
He's really through it?

520
00:32:46,941 --> 00:32:49,598
There's no more chance...
- He'll be outside working in a week.

521
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:56,221
I don't know what to say.

522
00:32:57,193 --> 00:32:59,264
You'd better think
about getting some sleep.

523
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:00,658
I know I am.

524
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:04,132
I mean, when I think of what I
did the first day we came...

525
00:33:05,868 --> 00:33:07,136
slapping you.

526
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:09,966
And here, ever since...

527
00:33:11,183 --> 00:33:12,564
it's been almost three days,

528
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,108
you stayed with him
practically every minute,

529
00:33:16,901 --> 00:33:18,671
pulling Gary through
this terrible...

530
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:22,992
Don't you see how ashamed I am?

531
00:33:24,882 --> 00:33:25,887
Oh that. I...

532
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:28,199
Out here we all slap each
other sooner or later.

533
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:31,745
You're just getting it out of
your system a little early, that's all.

534
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:37,676
Well, apologies or even
thanks would be silly now.

535
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,760
I just want you to know that
I owe you a great deal.

536
00:33:44,747 --> 00:33:46,719
I'll take your IOU.

537
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,538
Remember now.

538
00:33:57,732 --> 00:33:59,576
Don't hesitate to call me
if you need me.

539
00:33:59,803 --> 00:34:00,910
I won't, thanks.

540
00:34:02,521 --> 00:34:05,002
- Good night.
- Good night.

541
00:34:24,264 --> 00:34:25,559
What are you doing here?

542
00:34:26,157 --> 00:34:29,497
- I was just roaming around.
- Yeah?

543
00:34:29,532 --> 00:34:31,542
Go to bed. Nobody asked
you to lose any sleep.

544
00:34:31,577 --> 00:34:33,455
- How is he, Denny?
- He's through it.

545
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,141
Oh, gee, that's swell.
He's such a nice kid.

546
00:34:36,729 --> 00:34:39,001
Say, what's this? Some new
kind of an alarm clock?

547
00:34:39,136 --> 00:34:41,402
It doesn't seem to ring
or tick at all. - Hey!

548
00:34:42,295 --> 00:34:43,852
It was a barometer!

549
00:34:44,026 --> 00:34:45,716
I wouldn't swear to it now.

550
00:34:46,968 --> 00:34:48,013
Say listen,

551
00:34:48,114 --> 00:34:50,155
if you're just roaming around,
keep it up, will you?

552
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,296
I'm dead on my feet.

553
00:34:52,331 --> 00:34:54,721
I'm sorry, Dennie, can't I...

554
00:34:55,189 --> 00:34:56,714
Here. Let me get those.

555
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:06,615
There.

556
00:35:12,518 --> 00:35:14,597
Denny, have you got a headache?

557
00:35:15,587 --> 00:35:17,015
Maybe. I don't know.

558
00:35:17,471 --> 00:35:19,349
Would you like me
to rub your forehead?

559
00:35:19,596 --> 00:35:20,706
No.

560
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:24,001
Could I get you a drink
or something?

561
00:35:25,087 --> 00:35:26,242
No thanks.

562
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,562
Beat it to bed, will you?

563
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,731
Let's forget about the drink.

564
00:35:37,187 --> 00:35:39,567
I'll just rub your forehead
with sandpaper!

565
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,993
No, we'll just let Willis go out
and look around today.

566
00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:49,758
I thought I'd show him
that roadside and then

567
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:51,924
where we're going to lay
out the new stand on...

568
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:55,371
I don't care what you show him! Let him
get his bearings andl know where he's at.

569
00:35:55,406 --> 00:35:57,232
We'll find out soon enough
if he knows his business.

570
00:35:57,233 --> 00:35:59,533
Well, don't bite my arm off.
What's the matter with you?

571
00:36:04,392 --> 00:36:06,797
Hey, aren't you going out with us?

572
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,668
No, I'm not.

573
00:36:12,018 --> 00:36:14,166
You were mean not to awaken me.

574
00:36:14,218 --> 00:36:16,154
I wanted to see you off
on your first day.

575
00:36:16,352 --> 00:36:18,407
You need all the sleep
you can get for a while.

576
00:36:19,066 --> 00:36:20,943
You lost plenty over me.

577
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,330
All the trouble I've been to
everybody around here.

578
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:27,862
Dennis is a prince, isn't he?

579
00:36:28,602 --> 00:36:30,329
He was rather wonderful.

580
00:36:30,927 --> 00:36:33,042
Believe me, I'm going to
try to make it up to him.

581
00:36:35,749 --> 00:36:37,001
Wish me luck, darling.

582
00:36:37,036 --> 00:36:38,712
You don't need it, you're good.

583
00:36:41,016 --> 00:36:43,051
I've got to hurry, they're waiting.

584
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:47,510
Bye, honey. Now don't worry...
- Here.

585
00:36:50,095 --> 00:36:51,796
I don't know what
time we'll be back.

586
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,081
What the...

587
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,754
Hey! Hey!

588
00:37:03,746 --> 00:37:06,009
How many times have I told you
to let down those curtains?

589
00:37:06,603 --> 00:37:08,553
Why? They've all gone
off to work.

590
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:11,269
You heard me. Let them down!

591
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,843
What's the matter?

592
00:37:15,437 --> 00:37:17,314
Afraid I'll shock the Duchess?

593
00:37:17,704 --> 00:37:20,569
Don't you suppose she's ever
seen a French postcard?

594
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:26,795
You'll let those curtains down or
this is the last bath you'll ever have.

595
00:37:29,896 --> 00:37:31,076
Get out of there!

596
00:37:33,107 --> 00:37:34,333
Hey, what's the idea?

597
00:37:34,506 --> 00:37:36,271
- What?
- Getting in that barrel?

598
00:37:37,176 --> 00:37:41,263
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I'm
going over Niagara Falls.

599
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,534
You're supposed to
rinse off with that gourd.

600
00:37:46,938 --> 00:37:49,209
Hey, listen. You know
we drink that water?

601
00:37:49,244 --> 00:37:53,259
Yeah, well you won't this. Unless
you're stubborn and insist on it.

602
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:55,574
Come on, get out!

603
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:58,026
Oh, don't, Denny.
I'm in it now, stop!

604
00:37:58,438 --> 00:37:59,953
No, don't, Denny!

605
00:38:00,054 --> 00:38:03,063
Gee! Can't a girl take a bath
in privacy without...

606
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,505
Oh, good morning!

607
00:38:06,065 --> 00:38:08,201
You're just in time to see
the trained seal.

608
00:38:08,236 --> 00:38:10,324
Hey, Denny, scrub my back.

609
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:12,089
Get back in that barrel.

610
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:15,024
Don't, Denny! You just said
you didn't want me in it.

611
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,779
One more occurence like this and you'll
live in that shack across the river.

612
00:38:17,814 --> 00:38:19,425
I will not! And if
you think I give a...

613
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:32,376
Pardon the disturbance. One of
the guests was misusing the plumbing.

614
00:38:33,803 --> 00:38:35,459
I thought you'd gone with Gary.

615
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:40,303
No, I'm...tied up here this morning.

616
00:38:44,424 --> 00:38:45,710
What are your plans?

617
00:38:49,674 --> 00:38:52,096
I thought I'd take a walk
before it gets too hot.

618
00:38:53,392 --> 00:38:54,627
By the way,

619
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,158
you haven't had much of a chance
to see what goes on here.

620
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,353
Would you like to see
how we make the stuff?

621
00:38:59,664 --> 00:39:00,861
Why...

622
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:03,464
Why, yes. I'd love to.

623
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,599
Okay.

624
00:39:04,861 --> 00:39:06,095
Should I put on some boots?

625
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:07,923
No, you're all right.

626
00:39:10,906 --> 00:39:11,942
Thank you.

627
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:16,746
- Good morning, Bob.
- Good morning, sir.

628
00:39:18,218 --> 00:39:20,248
Here's where we find out
what a bad day we've had.

629
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,464
- Why, it's milk!
- Oh no, just rubber.

630
00:39:29,177 --> 00:39:31,574
But you could drink it if
you care to stretch a point.

631
00:39:32,271 --> 00:39:34,888
I once knew a man
who made a joke like that.

632
00:39:34,923 --> 00:39:37,236
He was run over by a truck.
- Were you driving it?

633
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:38,900
- Yes!
- You're out of luck here.

634
00:39:38,935 --> 00:39:41,522
We only have ox carts, and
every ox knows me personally.

635
00:39:43,778 --> 00:39:45,568
Here's where the milk
turns to cheese.

636
00:39:45,603 --> 00:39:47,312
You know, it usually takes
three hours or more,

637
00:39:47,347 --> 00:39:50,349
but for your entertainment,
I'll perform a miracle.

638
00:39:50,384 --> 00:39:52,723
You see, nothing up the sleeves...

639
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:56,196
no trap doors, no mirrors...

640
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,005
All visible to the naked eye.

641
00:40:00,784 --> 00:40:02,491
Just pour in acetic acid.

642
00:40:02,892 --> 00:40:06,364
The more acid, the quicker the
liquid rubber resents the insult,

643
00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:08,655
and stiffens up into
an indignant mass.

644
00:40:21,373 --> 00:40:23,464
There. Crude rubber.

645
00:40:27,283 --> 00:40:29,095
Well, I can't believe it.

646
00:40:35,086 --> 00:40:36,507
But how does it...

647
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:46,743
Master cook refuses to
roll it thin enough.

648
00:40:48,521 --> 00:40:51,713
You're a strange lot of
civilized barbarians...

649
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:54,427
working and living
your whole lives out here.

650
00:40:54,638 --> 00:40:55,998
Somebody's got to do it.

651
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:59,797
But don't you ever miss the people
and the comforts of the outside world?

652
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,284
Don't you ever get tired of this?

653
00:41:01,604 --> 00:41:05,025
We go on fighting it and grumbling
about the life but we're born to it.

654
00:41:06,969 --> 00:41:08,621
Perhaps it's hard for
a woman to understand.

655
00:41:08,748 --> 00:41:09,760
A little.

656
00:41:09,995 --> 00:41:13,358
I just realised that I've seen but
one woman since I've been here.

657
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,040
For instance, where are the
wives of all these natives?

658
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:18,138
Back country, in the villages.

659
00:41:18,173 --> 00:41:19,796
They've got to sign on
without them.

660
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:23,555
You mean you don't allow
wives on your plantation?

661
00:41:24,172 --> 00:41:26,612
Women don't belong here,
white or native.

662
00:41:26,647 --> 00:41:28,252
If they're white,
they can't stand the gaffe.

663
00:41:28,387 --> 00:41:29,295
If they're native,

664
00:41:29,552 --> 00:41:31,601
one of them is bound to drift
from the coolies' quarters,

665
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:33,368
and end up waiting
on you at breakfast.

666
00:41:34,009 --> 00:41:35,754
And that's curtains for
a man in this country.

667
00:41:38,113 --> 00:41:39,999
Here's something
that might interest you.

668
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,387
This is...

669
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:49,369
what pencil erasers look like
before they're born.

670
00:41:52,754 --> 00:41:53,841
There you are.

671
00:41:56,117 --> 00:41:58,703
See all the little pencil erasers
trying to erase each other?

672
00:41:59,287 --> 00:42:00,298
Yes.

673
00:42:04,413 --> 00:42:06,204
What about that girl...

674
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:07,821
back at the house.

675
00:42:08,089 --> 00:42:09,395
Vantine, isn't it?

676
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,471
Yes, what about her?

677
00:42:13,351 --> 00:42:14,535
I mean...

678
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:17,699
Is she a part of the life here?

679
00:42:18,553 --> 00:42:19,703
Very definitely.

680
00:42:19,975 --> 00:42:21,930
If a man wants to be interested.

681
00:42:26,447 --> 00:42:27,574
- Big rain's coming.
- Yeah!

682
00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:28,986
Perhaps we'd better
get back to the house.

683
00:42:29,021 --> 00:42:31,749
- Is there going to be a storm? - Usually
it only threatens this time of the year.

684
00:42:31,784 --> 00:42:33,298
It's a little early for the monsoon.

685
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:41,075
Look out for the traffic!

686
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:46,045
I'd have walked right into it.
I was wool gathering.

687
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,149
No profit in wool these days!

688
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:49,901
What about?

689
00:42:50,971 --> 00:42:52,369
Well, you said...

690
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:56,081
that a white woman out here couldn't
stand "the gaffe", as you called it.

691
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:59,892
Perhaps I was thinking
of my mother.

692
00:43:00,188 --> 00:43:02,826
Her grave is on the hill at
the far edge of the compound.

693
00:43:03,342 --> 00:43:06,704
You know, I faintly remember asking
my father if he was digging a well.

694
00:43:08,064 --> 00:43:10,593
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

695
00:43:11,187 --> 00:43:14,319
However, I'm not forcasting
any such dark future for you.

696
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,975
But don't you really think
I could fit in out here?

697
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,321
Don't you think that
I could be happy?

698
00:43:24,994 --> 00:43:27,715
Would you mind if I made it
my job to see that you are?

699
00:43:30,017 --> 00:43:33,429
Well, I want everyone
to like me out here.

700
00:43:33,464 --> 00:43:34,870
That's not difficult.

701
00:43:35,517 --> 00:43:38,565
I have a special fondness for somebody
who stands up and fights back.

702
00:43:39,261 --> 00:43:42,597
Particularly if she's a woman who looks
extraordinarily beautiful when she's doing it.

703
00:43:43,293 --> 00:43:45,633
And even more beautiful
when she's calmed down.

704
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:52,047
That's a very polished little
speech for a...

705
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:53,640
barbarian.

706
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:56,357
You admitted the barbarian
was civilized, didn't you?

707
00:43:56,899 --> 00:43:58,658
Why, I've forgotten what I said.

708
00:44:01,307 --> 00:44:03,111
Are you going to
forget what I said?

709
00:44:06,298 --> 00:44:09,210
- Goodness, what's happening?
- Come on, we've got to make it!

710
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:44,855
Hoy, hurry up, you idiot!

711
00:44:45,733 --> 00:44:47,692
Peep, peep! Like you, water!

712
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,000
Better be nice!
Better be quite nice!

713
00:45:24,444 --> 00:45:25,607
Thank you.

714
00:45:29,702 --> 00:45:31,233
Please, let me down.

715
00:45:32,836 --> 00:45:34,439
Aren't you comfortable?

716
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:39,391
Why...

717
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,606
We shouldn't have done that.

718
00:46:10,082 --> 00:46:11,520
But we did.

719
00:46:36,734 --> 00:46:38,727
- Hoy! Tell them to saddle up.
- All right.

720
00:46:41,221 --> 00:46:43,326
Did the Duchess sprain her ankle?

721
00:46:48,122 --> 00:46:51,312
It must be wonderful
to be big and strong.

722
00:46:51,547 --> 00:46:52,965
Think how all the girls...

723
00:46:55,866 --> 00:46:58,910
Be careful the rain doesn't wash
the rouge off your mouth!

724
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:29,983
Do you mind if I stay
in here with you?

725
00:47:30,361 --> 00:47:32,389
Think you can stand the company?

726
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,888
Please, it's...

727
00:47:36,672 --> 00:47:37,882
It's just that I...

728
00:47:41,019 --> 00:47:43,932
Pity the poor sailors
on a night like this.

729
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:46,861
Dear little sailors!

730
00:47:49,638 --> 00:47:51,579
How long is it going to keep up?

731
00:47:52,253 --> 00:47:54,224
Does it ever stop,
even for a minute?

732
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,936
Not even for lunch.

733
00:48:07,094 --> 00:48:11,300
Stop playing stoop tag.
You'll know it if you're hit.

734
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:34,919
Here. Put this inside you.

735
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,396
All of it.

736
00:48:45,433 --> 00:48:47,781
It'll make you forget
a lot of things.

737
00:48:52,449 --> 00:48:53,859
That was nice of you.

738
00:48:55,648 --> 00:48:57,616
It's stupid of me
to be so frightened.

739
00:49:01,618 --> 00:49:05,006
This storm isn't the only thing that
has you worried around here, is it?

740
00:49:05,534 --> 00:49:09,312
I saw him kick the door shut. He came
out with rouge all over his mouth.

741
00:49:09,448 --> 00:49:10,504
Why...

742
00:49:10,539 --> 00:49:12,754
I suppose he asked
to use your lipstick!

743
00:49:18,066 --> 00:49:19,829
I don't know how it happened.

744
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:22,551
I didn't do anything.

745
00:49:23,402 --> 00:49:25,398
He didn't have any reason
to believe that I'd...

746
00:49:25,987 --> 00:49:28,021
I didn't hear any cries for help.

747
00:49:32,326 --> 00:49:34,312
I don't know what came over me.

748
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:37,844
I should have stopped him.

749
00:49:39,054 --> 00:49:42,038
I tried but...
- But you couldn't.

750
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:47,463
Even when you tried...
Could you?

751
00:49:48,572 --> 00:49:49,597
No.

752
00:49:50,942 --> 00:49:52,379
That's why I'm scared.

753
00:49:57,517 --> 00:49:58,988
Oh, it's too silly!

754
00:49:59,491 --> 00:50:01,174
What do I mean I'm scared?

755
00:50:01,787 --> 00:50:04,026
It was just one of those
excitement-of-the-moment things.

756
00:50:04,604 --> 00:50:06,792
Well, watch out for the
next moment, honey.

757
00:50:06,827 --> 00:50:09,008
It's longer than the first.

758
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:17,401
Gosh, these peaches are good.

759
00:50:18,831 --> 00:50:21,225
I never ate so much in
my life, how about that?

760
00:50:21,408 --> 00:50:23,525
You know, ever since
we were married

761
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,757
that one over there has been
after me for not eating enough.

762
00:50:26,097 --> 00:50:29,481
Guess you're not worried about me wasting
away after this meal, are you, Mrs. Willis?

763
00:50:29,685 --> 00:50:31,000
You have rather stuffed yourself.

764
00:50:31,324 --> 00:50:32,807
That's what a full day's
work will do for you.

765
00:50:32,842 --> 00:50:35,257
Full day's work? I'll say it was.

766
00:50:35,817 --> 00:50:37,683
Those coolies are tough
to handle, aren't they?

767
00:50:37,718 --> 00:50:39,699
Didn't I tell you they
were a lazy bunch?

768
00:50:39,734 --> 00:50:42,173
I mean, I didn't know they
were so sneaky about it.

769
00:50:42,212 --> 00:50:45,592
The minute you turn your back on them, they're
up to something or other they shouldn't be doing.

770
00:50:47,168 --> 00:50:49,378
Are they always like that?
- I'm afraid so.

771
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:52,802
I was telling him about the time
that malay tried to knife you in the back.

772
00:50:53,059 --> 00:50:55,315
It's a great country
for that sort of thing.

773
00:50:58,516 --> 00:51:00,854
I guess Mac could have
used you out there today.

774
00:51:01,072 --> 00:51:03,185
But I imagine you had
plenty to do around here.

775
00:51:03,288 --> 00:51:04,937
You should have seen us, Babs.

776
00:51:05,368 --> 00:51:08,802
We were up to our knees in water trying to
get a drain ditch through to the main channel.

777
00:51:08,937 --> 00:51:10,534
And every time
we looked for a coolie...

778
00:51:12,506 --> 00:51:16,581
Hey, darling! What game are
you playing? What's the score?

779
00:51:16,935 --> 00:51:18,196
Babs!
- What?

780
00:51:20,387 --> 00:51:22,519
- Set them up in the other alley!
- Oh Gary, please don't!

781
00:51:23,078 --> 00:51:24,122
Babs!

782
00:51:24,157 --> 00:51:27,988
This little taste of bad weather we've had today is
enough to upset anybody, if they're not used to it.

783
00:51:28,196 --> 00:51:29,687
Why don't you turn in early?

784
00:51:30,075 --> 00:51:32,150
I think I will if you'll
all excuse me.

785
00:51:32,285 --> 00:51:33,766
Good night.
- Good night.

786
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:35,476
- I'll be in soon, darling.
- All right, dear.

787
00:51:37,492 --> 00:51:40,882
I might have realized, all that
thunder and lightning today...

788
00:51:42,816 --> 00:51:44,268
Gee, I'm dumb.

789
00:51:44,303 --> 00:51:46,389
No, how were you to know?

790
00:51:55,584 --> 00:51:57,682
Well Gary, now that
you're in shape again,

791
00:51:57,717 --> 00:52:00,057
we can start out on the first
real job I have for you.

792
00:52:00,092 --> 00:52:01,346
Great! You know me.

793
00:52:01,683 --> 00:52:04,388
You and Mac and Guidon will leave
here tomorrow, take a full crew.

794
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:07,089
Camp down below the south creek
for the next 3 or 4 weeks.

795
00:52:08,268 --> 00:52:10,537
Remember? I started to tell
you about it the other day.

796
00:52:11,221 --> 00:52:13,373
There's that 500 acres
I want you to survey.

797
00:52:14,161 --> 00:52:16,929
Lay out a course for best drainage,
then throw up a bridge over the creek

798
00:52:16,964 --> 00:52:18,912
and cut through a road
leading back to the compound,

799
00:52:18,947 --> 00:52:19,910
for shortest
and easiest hauling.

800
00:52:19,945 --> 00:52:23,504
We can't do that job now, Denny.
The rains have started.

801
00:52:23,701 --> 00:52:25,294
It's a nice time to pick for it.

802
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,685
What's the matter with you guys?
Getting soft?

803
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:30,032
This plantation's got
to increase production.

804
00:52:30,354 --> 00:52:32,532
Okay, Denny,
if you're dead set on it.

805
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:34,139
Well believe me, I am.

806
00:52:34,245 --> 00:52:36,365
I've got to begin to
earn my salt here.

807
00:52:36,638 --> 00:52:38,974
Let me see:
Three or four weeks.

808
00:52:40,256 --> 00:52:42,152
What about Babs?
Will it be all right for her?

809
00:52:42,187 --> 00:52:44,428
If she wants to go, but I think
it would be foolish to take her.

810
00:52:44,463 --> 00:52:48,358
Down in them swamps? Why,
that's no place for a woman, boy.

811
00:52:48,393 --> 00:52:50,626
There won't be a dry
blanket in the outfit.

812
00:52:51,015 --> 00:52:52,435
No, it's tough enough for a man.

813
00:52:52,955 --> 00:52:54,957
But I'll be riding down every
now and then while you're there.

814
00:52:54,992 --> 00:52:56,932
Maybe I could bring her
along for a visit. - Fine!

815
00:52:57,475 --> 00:53:00,146
I'd better go in and see if
there's anything I can do for her.

816
00:53:00,554 --> 00:53:02,301
I'll come back later
and talk it over.

817
00:53:02,336 --> 00:53:04,224
The morning's time enough,
just a few details.

818
00:53:04,259 --> 00:53:05,518
Right.

819
00:53:05,896 --> 00:53:08,315
Come on, you fellows.
We've got to cover up those vats.

820
00:53:19,792 --> 00:53:21,073
That's a sensible girl.

821
00:53:24,303 --> 00:53:26,496
You must be dreadfully tired, Gary.

822
00:53:28,984 --> 00:53:30,216
Silly!

823
00:53:36,694 --> 00:53:38,550
You'd better be
pretty nice to me, lady.

824
00:53:39,354 --> 00:53:41,681
I'm gonna leave you widowed
for three or four weeks.

825
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:42,830
Why...

826
00:53:43,522 --> 00:53:45,138
what do you mean?

827
00:53:45,273 --> 00:53:47,649
Dennis is sending me out
on my first field trip.

828
00:53:48,819 --> 00:53:50,927
Mac, Guidon and I
are leaving in the morning.

829
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:53,388
I asked Dennis if you
could go along, darling.

830
00:53:54,786 --> 00:53:57,858
He says it's an awfully
rotten area, even for a man.

831
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,265
Gary...

832
00:54:03,437 --> 00:54:04,771
- Yes?
- Maybe I...

833
00:54:05,573 --> 00:54:08,491
Well...maybe I'd better go.

834
00:54:09,448 --> 00:54:11,667
But do you really think you
could stand it down there?

835
00:54:12,996 --> 00:54:14,729
It's nothing but a swamp, you know.

836
00:54:15,562 --> 00:54:18,454
Sleeping in tents, in
the wet and everything.

837
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,058
What do you think?

838
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,235
I don't know what to think.

839
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,015
It's all right, darling.

840
00:54:38,243 --> 00:54:39,300
Hey.

841
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,113
Yeah?

842
00:54:41,248 --> 00:54:44,002
A few days ago you said something
about sending me back to Saigon,

843
00:54:44,037 --> 00:54:45,571
in a hammock through the bush.

844
00:54:46,031 --> 00:54:47,575
You've been behaving yourself.

845
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:48,635
Maybe.

846
00:54:48,941 --> 00:54:50,730
Bring on the hammock and
the coolies, will you?

847
00:54:54,764 --> 00:54:56,403
What's the matter with you?
Crazy?

848
00:54:58,181 --> 00:55:00,074
Just a little nauseated.

849
00:55:00,109 --> 00:55:03,935
This rain seems to have uncovered
a pile of garbage around here.

850
00:55:06,681 --> 00:55:09,182
Stop looking through keyholes.
It's bad for the eyes.

851
00:55:09,552 --> 00:55:12,145
Can I have the coolies?
Nice, speedy ones?

852
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,065
No. I can't spare one.

853
00:55:14,702 --> 00:55:16,576
I'll reduce your rent, however.

854
00:55:17,678 --> 00:55:19,342
Increasing production, eh?

855
00:55:23,483 --> 00:55:26,674
Listen, what goes on
here is my business.

856
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:29,362
Suppose I were to tell
that nice white kid.

857
00:55:29,813 --> 00:55:31,777
He'd make it his business,
wouldn't he?

858
00:55:33,478 --> 00:55:35,449
Suppose I tell him myself.

859
00:55:58,022 --> 00:56:01,350
Okay, mark it station 30 plus 24.

860
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,542
Station 30 plus 24.

861
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:14,035
Can't you whistle another tune?
That's all I've heard for three weeks.

862
00:56:14,524 --> 00:56:16,679
Maybe Dennis will bring
my saxophone when he comes.

863
00:56:16,914 --> 00:56:18,183
You didn't know I had one, did you?

864
00:56:18,555 --> 00:56:20,887
Yeah? When's he coming,
that's what I wanna know.

865
00:56:38,514 --> 00:56:39,885
Look, Miss Van!

866
00:56:47,968 --> 00:56:50,364
Goodness, you even
find them in the jungle.

867
00:56:51,272 --> 00:56:54,161
Pretty lady pretty pants,
peep peep!

868
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:00,280
Yeah, a lady! That's why
he's so nuts about her.

869
00:57:02,331 --> 00:57:06,166
Mr. Denny very very happy.
Mr. Denny got love.

870
00:57:07,742 --> 00:57:11,813
He's in love all right.
The real thing too, I guess.

871
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:15,260
Of all the people in the world!

872
00:57:16,073 --> 00:57:17,880
Miss Van never been in love?

873
00:57:18,015 --> 00:57:20,361
Hoy thought one time
you and Mr. Denny...

874
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:22,449
- Never mind about that!
- Yes, Miss Van.

875
00:57:28,998 --> 00:57:31,117
What you been eating? Cement?

876
00:57:35,943 --> 00:57:38,508
- Mrs. Willis, clean clothes.
- Come in.

877
00:57:46,321 --> 00:57:49,378
- Where Hoy put this?
- Any place over there, Hoy.

878
00:57:49,513 --> 00:57:50,690
All right.

879
00:57:53,127 --> 00:57:55,404
- Hoy!
- Here, Mr. Denny.

880
00:57:59,619 --> 00:58:01,161
Did you put that new lamp
in Mrs. Willis's room?

881
00:58:01,196 --> 00:58:02,566
Yes, Mr. Denny.

882
00:58:02,601 --> 00:58:05,172
You'll find a couple more pheasants
hanging up in the back shed.

883
00:58:05,407 --> 00:58:06,506
Fix them for dinner tonight.

884
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:08,393
You know, the way
Mrs. Willis likes them.

885
00:58:08,428 --> 00:58:09,710
Yes, Mr. Denny.

886
00:58:13,575 --> 00:58:14,660
Can I come in?

887
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:18,839
Wait a minute.

888
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:25,778
All right, come in.

889
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:32,206
I...
Did you get the lamp all right?

890
00:58:32,241 --> 00:58:33,626
Yes, thanks so much.

891
00:58:33,661 --> 00:58:35,298
Does it light up all right?

892
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:36,980
Lights up perfectly.

893
00:58:38,694 --> 00:58:40,743
I heard you order the pheasants.

894
00:58:40,778 --> 00:58:42,930
Well, I thought you might
like a little change.

895
00:58:44,158 --> 00:58:47,124
Yes...a change.

896
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,935
I'm glad.

897
00:58:54,938 --> 00:58:56,130
You're glad?

898
00:59:05,404 --> 00:59:07,148
I never thought this could happen.

899
00:59:07,937 --> 00:59:09,068
What?

900
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:11,766
I'm afraid I'm pretty
crazy about you.

901
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:14,949
Always? For keeps?

902
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:17,135
And after that too.

903
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,352
We'll get out of
this rotten country.

904
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,170
I've always known that some day...

905
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:26,829
We'll have a swell time, Babs.

906
00:59:28,918 --> 00:59:32,046
Don't call me Babs, dear.
Do you mind?

907
00:59:33,212 --> 00:59:34,360
Why not?

908
00:59:37,091 --> 00:59:38,296
Oh.

909
00:59:40,217 --> 00:59:41,574
Say, look...

910
00:59:42,668 --> 00:59:44,424
I've got to go down river today.

911
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,693
They're having a little
trouble with the coolies.

912
00:59:49,138 --> 00:59:51,739
- You'll see him?
- Yes.

913
01:00:00,176 --> 01:00:02,316
Are you gonna tell him so soon?

914
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:05,846
Sure. Might as well
get it over with.

915
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,224
Now?

916
01:00:09,252 --> 01:00:10,833
No, can't we just...

917
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:14,030
- Oh, Dennis maybe...
- Want to back out?

918
01:00:15,184 --> 01:00:16,661
Oh, no.

919
01:00:18,146 --> 01:00:20,354
But he's so...helpless.

920
01:00:22,032 --> 01:00:23,758
Well, it's just a tough break.

921
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,982
Oh, Dennis, you'll come back to me?

922
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:31,916
Day after tomorrow.

923
01:00:33,592 --> 01:00:36,353
- I'm frightened.
- What of?

924
01:00:38,612 --> 01:00:40,778
Say, at that,
it might be better if...

925
01:00:41,451 --> 01:00:44,073
Did Gary leave you a gun?
- It isn't that.

926
01:00:45,724 --> 01:00:47,552
You do love me, don't you?

927
01:00:49,259 --> 01:00:50,662
Want it in writing?

928
01:00:58,082 --> 01:00:59,382
Goodbye, kid.

929
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,343
It's only for a couple
of days, and then...

930
01:01:04,371 --> 01:01:05,756
Goodbye, dear.

931
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:24,515
Now listen.

932
01:01:25,225 --> 01:01:28,049
I'm going down river and probably
won't be back till morning.

933
01:01:29,211 --> 01:01:32,683
If you can't be pleasant to her while I'm
gone, just keep out of her way, understand?

934
01:01:32,718 --> 01:01:34,489
Oh, that's too bad!

935
01:01:35,223 --> 01:01:37,505
She and I could have had
such a lovely day.

936
01:01:37,665 --> 01:01:40,532
Just two girls together
with so much in common.

937
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:41,730
You heard me.

938
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:44,990
I thought we might run up a few
curtains and make a batch of fudge,

939
01:01:45,025 --> 01:01:48,707
while we were planning what to wear to
the country club dance Saturday night.

940
01:01:48,714 --> 01:01:50,067
Just remember, Lily:

941
01:01:50,685 --> 01:01:52,468
All those lame cracks
won't help you any

942
01:01:52,503 --> 01:01:54,274
if I come back and find out you've
been annoying her in any way.

943
01:01:54,309 --> 01:01:56,941
Oh, I wouldn't touch her with
your best pair of rubber gloves!

944
01:02:13,315 --> 01:02:14,562
Hey!

945
01:02:16,326 --> 01:02:18,972
Hey, Denny!
Here's the boss!

946
01:02:25,948 --> 01:02:26,954
Hello, boys!

947
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:29,151
I hear you're having
a little cat trouble.

948
01:02:29,186 --> 01:02:32,950
Yes, he's a big tom tiger! The first
bullock was chewed up last week.

949
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:37,230
Same old story. I can't convince
them he isn't a man-eater.

950
01:02:37,445 --> 01:02:39,391
Can't haul any more
lumber for his bridge.

951
01:02:39,799 --> 01:02:41,755
The brave fellows won't
go in and cut it out.

952
01:02:43,878 --> 01:02:45,213
All like that.

953
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:47,718
If you can't get them back
to work, Denny, nobody can.

954
01:02:47,918 --> 01:02:50,837
The quickest way to fix that is to
put a little lead in the friendly cat.

955
01:02:50,872 --> 01:02:53,670
Did the runners spot it? - He was
over the rim of the hill last night.

956
01:02:53,743 --> 01:02:54,639
Let's have a look.

957
01:02:54,674 --> 01:02:57,788
We'll put up some blinds, and
stake out a few bullocks tonight.

958
01:03:04,037 --> 01:03:06,095
Babs didn't feel like
coming down, huh?

959
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:08,967
- Why, no...
- You see, I was...

960
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:11,070
I was sort of expecting it.

961
01:03:11,093 --> 01:03:13,752
It's a long hard trip, you know,
bad weather and all.

962
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:15,463
She...

963
01:03:15,689 --> 01:03:17,160
She didn't send a note or anything?

964
01:03:17,295 --> 01:03:19,479
No, as a matter of fact,
she didn't have time.

965
01:03:19,842 --> 01:03:23,336
I came right away, just yelled in that I was
going as they brought the horse around.

966
01:03:24,852 --> 01:03:27,154
She...sends her love of course.

967
01:03:29,402 --> 01:03:31,459
She couldn't send very much...

968
01:03:32,136 --> 01:03:33,659
I brought most of it along with me.

969
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:35,785
How's your work been coming?

970
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:38,537
I'll take you over everything I've done
tomorrow. I think you'll be pleased about it.

971
01:03:38,572 --> 01:03:41,328
I've worked night and
day to rush the job, I...

972
01:03:42,187 --> 01:03:43,855
I sure want to get
back to the house.

973
01:03:44,229 --> 01:03:45,537
- Hey, Mac
- What?

974
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:47,739
We'll each take a blind tonight,
you take Gary in with you.

975
01:03:47,878 --> 01:03:49,042
Okay Denny.

976
01:03:49,511 --> 01:03:51,055
Couldn't I stick along with you?

977
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:52,922
Mac and I have been cooped
up so long together

978
01:03:52,957 --> 01:03:54,964
we haven't got
a new joke between us.

979
01:03:55,013 --> 01:03:57,291
- Sure, if you like.
- Then we can talk things over.

980
01:04:09,754 --> 01:04:11,612
That cat'll be good
and hungry again.

981
01:04:12,144 --> 01:04:14,726
He'll start stalking one of the
baits soon after sundown.

982
01:04:16,128 --> 01:04:17,164
Yeah.

983
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:26,811
- That's a mighty nice lad, Denny.
- I guess he is.

984
01:04:27,502 --> 01:04:31,246
But just as you thought,
he'll never make the grade.

985
01:04:32,022 --> 01:04:34,324
Poor lad.
He wants to make good, too.

986
01:04:35,059 --> 01:04:37,274
His fever came back on
him a little bit yesterday,

987
01:04:38,028 --> 01:04:40,701
but he sat up all night
going over his charts.

988
01:04:41,596 --> 01:04:44,203
And say, to hear him
talk about you,

989
01:04:44,976 --> 01:04:47,798
he'd cut off both his legs
if you gave him the word.

990
01:04:48,349 --> 01:04:51,042
- Better stake out that
other bullock. - Okay, Denny.

991
01:04:57,089 --> 01:05:00,392
Say...Can I have first shot at him?

992
01:05:00,976 --> 01:05:02,680
If you guarantee you won't miss.

993
01:05:02,948 --> 01:05:04,267
Well, you'll be right there.

994
01:05:04,754 --> 01:05:07,734
I'd give anything to be able to
take the hide back to Babs.

995
01:05:08,184 --> 01:05:09,344
Let's get up.

996
01:05:33,548 --> 01:05:36,054
It's something like spearing
sunfish with a lantern.

997
01:05:36,702 --> 01:05:38,190
Only not so easy.

998
01:05:40,378 --> 01:05:42,346
Nothing's easy down
in this country.

999
01:05:42,797 --> 01:05:45,265
That's what makes the life
worth living, I say.

1000
01:05:49,366 --> 01:05:51,305
What are you going to do
after you leave here?

1001
01:05:51,813 --> 01:05:53,157
Oh, I don't know.

1002
01:05:53,573 --> 01:05:56,208
That's a little far ahead
to think of now, I guess.

1003
01:05:56,532 --> 01:05:58,683
I always thought I'd like to
go on doing this sort of thing,

1004
01:05:58,718 --> 01:06:01,219
go to South America,
you know, expeditions?

1005
01:06:02,908 --> 01:06:04,453
That was B.B.

1006
01:06:05,405 --> 01:06:07,985
- B.B.?
- Yeah!

1007
01:06:08,857 --> 01:06:10,238
Before Babs.

1008
01:06:11,324 --> 01:06:12,590
Oh.

1009
01:06:13,444 --> 01:06:14,801
You must think I'm an awful ass,

1010
01:06:14,856 --> 01:06:17,308
to keep talking about Barbara
this way all the time.

1011
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:19,485
No.

1012
01:06:24,173 --> 01:06:25,257
Here's your gun.

1013
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:30,794
I always feel a fellow can talk about
things that are close and intimate to him

1014
01:06:31,638 --> 01:06:33,102
when he's with a guy who...

1015
01:06:33,646 --> 01:06:35,664
well...who understands.

1016
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,504
That's why I'm not at all
ashamed to tell you,

1017
01:06:38,739 --> 01:06:40,254
I'd fold up without Babs.

1018
01:06:41,926 --> 01:06:45,234
Just being away from her
this long has proven that.

1019
01:06:49,917 --> 01:06:52,904
This would be a bad country to
raise children in, wouldn't it?

1020
01:06:54,873 --> 01:06:57,558
- Oh, I don't know.
- See...

1021
01:06:58,622 --> 01:07:00,978
Babs and I were going
to have children right away,

1022
01:07:01,577 --> 01:07:03,128
and this job came up.

1023
01:07:05,374 --> 01:07:06,473
Kids.

1024
01:07:07,028 --> 01:07:09,351
First a couple of boys,
and then a girl perhaps.

1025
01:07:11,664 --> 01:07:13,813
Will I walk down the main street!

1026
01:07:15,734 --> 01:07:17,739
I guess we'll wait until
we get back home.

1027
01:07:17,774 --> 01:07:20,433
Before we left, we bought a piece
of property outside New York

1028
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,739
up on the Hudson.

1029
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:25,132
We're going to build
and settle down there.

1030
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:28,204
It's only 35 miles from New York,
and it's real rural country.

1031
01:07:28,883 --> 01:07:29,904
A guy can commute...

1032
01:07:30,371 --> 01:07:33,614
Babs will be right there with all the
people she's known and grown up with.

1033
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:35,793
All our closest friends
have settled there too.

1034
01:07:36,529 --> 01:07:38,793
And it'll be a swell place
for the children.

1035
01:07:40,454 --> 01:07:42,592
And when their Uncle Dennis
comes up from the tropics,

1036
01:07:42,627 --> 01:07:44,889
he can tell them about the
time their dad shot a tiger

1037
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:47,290
as he charged ruthlessly through
the... - Keep quiet, will you?

1038
01:07:48,826 --> 01:07:50,054
What's the matter?

1039
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:53,287
I thought you said we could
talk until it got dark?

1040
01:07:54,189 --> 01:07:56,664
Well, we won't talk anymore.
Better not.

1041
01:08:24,552 --> 01:08:25,976
Yay! You got him!

1042
01:08:27,118 --> 01:08:29,754
Gee, that was a swell shot.
He was too fast for me.

1043
01:08:31,247 --> 01:08:33,711
Gee! Look at it!

1044
01:08:35,801 --> 01:08:37,295
Gee, what a thrill that was.

1045
01:08:44,455 --> 01:08:46,450
I'm going home tonight,
Mac. Get my horse.

1046
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,718
But it's a rotten ride
this late, Denny!

1047
01:08:48,753 --> 01:08:50,109
I have to go, I tell you.

1048
01:08:50,555 --> 01:08:52,461
All right!

1049
01:08:56,983 --> 01:08:58,709
Feel like you could
eat some supper?

1050
01:08:59,306 --> 01:09:00,631
Not particularly.

1051
01:09:00,778 --> 01:09:03,200
I guess you must be
pretty well done in at that.

1052
01:09:03,934 --> 01:09:06,673
You take my cot, and
turn in right after chow.

1053
01:09:06,823 --> 01:09:08,925
I got the most comfortable
cot in the outfit.

1054
01:09:09,022 --> 01:09:11,285
No, I'm going back right now.

1055
01:09:11,886 --> 01:09:13,272
- Going back?
- Yeah.

1056
01:09:14,426 --> 01:09:17,533
I've got a fresh batch of young trees
coming through for coagulation tomorrow,

1057
01:09:17,563 --> 01:09:19,003
and I gotta be on hand.

1058
01:09:19,895 --> 01:09:22,423
I thought we could spend the morning
going over everything I'd done.

1059
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:25,526
No, I'll leave it to you guys.
Mac says you're doing great.

1060
01:09:26,018 --> 01:09:28,820
- Say, I think it's too much for you.
- Can't be helped.

1061
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,923
Goodbye, kid.

1062
01:09:34,397 --> 01:09:35,680
So long, Denny.

1063
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:40,503
Bye, Denny!

1064
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:52,746
It doesn't seem at all worthwhile
for Denny to go back this way.

1065
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:55,507
Six hours in the dark.

1066
01:09:56,023 --> 01:09:57,396
Through this weather.

1067
01:09:58,135 --> 01:10:00,238
You ought to know whether
it's worthwhile or not.

1068
01:10:00,631 --> 01:10:01,867
What do you mean?

1069
01:10:02,179 --> 01:10:04,958
Just what I say. You ought to
know your wife better than I do.

1070
01:10:08,619 --> 01:10:10,401
What the devil are you driving at?

1071
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:13,271
Why do you suppose he sent
you up on this job for?

1072
01:10:13,817 --> 01:10:16,467
He got you up and out of the house
as soon as you could walk, didn't he?

1073
01:10:17,059 --> 01:10:18,415
Why, the night before we left,

1074
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:21,306
it was an open book on both their
faces there was something up.

1075
01:10:21,655 --> 01:10:23,633
He's been making a play
for your wife ever since...

1076
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:26,148
- Hey!
- Why, you...

1077
01:10:26,771 --> 01:10:29,285
- Cut it, you two!
- Get him and hold him!

1078
01:10:29,648 --> 01:10:32,048
- Did you hear what he said? Why...
- Now wait.

1079
01:10:32,264 --> 01:10:34,416
Don't pay any attention to
his drunken mouth, lad.

1080
01:10:34,651 --> 01:10:35,977
He's been drinking all day,

1081
01:10:36,012 --> 01:10:38,927
and whenever he gets that way,
he always gets ugly about Denny.

1082
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:40,649
Now forget it.

1083
01:10:41,799 --> 01:10:42,821
All right, Mac.

1084
01:10:44,292 --> 01:10:45,401
Okay.

1085
01:11:19,971 --> 01:11:21,336
Hey, Limey!

1086
01:11:28,551 --> 01:11:30,250
Hello, Mr. Carson!

1087
01:11:30,868 --> 01:11:33,852
What are you doing so far
off the manor this time of the night?

1088
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:35,289
Communing with nature?

1089
01:11:35,476 --> 01:11:36,859
When will you get fixed up?

1090
01:11:37,066 --> 01:11:38,607
All ship-shape again.

1091
01:11:38,986 --> 01:11:40,953
We'll be dropping her back
again in the morning,

1092
01:11:40,988 --> 01:11:43,879
and then I'll head back and pick up that
little girl with the golden locks, eh?

1093
01:11:44,564 --> 01:11:45,639
Yes.

1094
01:11:46,374 --> 01:11:48,957
Won't you come aboard
and take a nip?

1095
01:11:49,192 --> 01:11:52,720
I'm just about to wring the
neck off another bottle.

1096
01:11:52,755 --> 01:11:55,047
No, thanks.
See you tomorrow, Limey.

1097
01:11:55,082 --> 01:11:56,897
Aye aye, sir!

1098
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:02,513
Well, if it ain't old Master Fred,

1099
01:13:02,661 --> 01:13:05,055
back after all these years!

1100
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:12,435
Is the burial private?

1101
01:13:12,998 --> 01:13:14,914
Or didn't you bring
the body with you?

1102
01:13:17,223 --> 01:13:19,887
You don't look a day older
than when you went away.

1103
01:13:20,848 --> 01:13:22,903
We just loved your postcard.

1104
01:13:23,203 --> 01:13:25,572
My, you ought to see
how little Emily's grown.

1105
01:13:25,626 --> 01:13:27,035
And the twins...

1106
01:13:28,599 --> 01:13:30,058
Thanks, old man.

1107
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:33,435
Don't care if I do.

1108
01:13:38,429 --> 01:13:40,897
Well now, tell me everything
you've been doing.

1109
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:43,856
Guidon sends you his love.

1110
01:13:43,891 --> 01:13:47,055
How is dear, dear Guidon?
As divine as ever?

1111
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:49,020
Say, what's ever become of...

1112
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:51,708
What's his name, that young
fellow with the attractive wife?

1113
01:13:52,692 --> 01:13:54,251
You'd be surprised.

1114
01:13:54,978 --> 01:13:57,569
Dear me!
And he was so nice too.

1115
01:13:58,126 --> 01:14:00,215
Treacherous climate down here.

1116
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,828
Where did you get that kimono?

1117
01:14:02,863 --> 01:14:04,838
Now Fred, don't change the subject!

1118
01:14:05,873 --> 01:14:07,453
What are you trying to do,
get drunk?

1119
01:14:09,114 --> 01:14:10,772
That's not a bad idea.

1120
01:14:11,325 --> 01:14:13,744
What is it?
Did your team win?

1121
01:14:14,674 --> 01:14:16,634
No, we lost.

1122
01:14:17,232 --> 01:14:19,009
107 to nothing.

1123
01:14:19,313 --> 01:14:20,665
What's the matter? Wet field?

1124
01:14:21,928 --> 01:14:24,084
Sloppy. Sticky.

1125
01:14:27,403 --> 01:14:28,876
You know what I've just been?

1126
01:14:29,749 --> 01:14:32,259
- What?
- I've been noble!

1127
01:14:33,693 --> 01:14:37,572
I give you Saint Dennis,
the big sacrifice boy.

1128
01:14:37,896 --> 01:14:42,390
Oh...there isn't gonna
be any funeral.

1129
01:14:43,394 --> 01:14:46,875
Sure, mine.
With a lily in my hand!

1130
01:14:48,081 --> 01:14:50,536
Little Denny is an angel
now with a harp

1131
01:14:50,571 --> 01:14:52,809
and a big, round, rosy halo.

1132
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,595
Fred, I'm awful glad.

1133
01:14:56,332 --> 01:14:58,481
Are you?
Well, I'm not.

1134
01:14:59,441 --> 01:15:01,533
Of all the sap tricks.

1135
01:15:02,324 --> 01:15:04,743
He is a nice white kid, isn't he?

1136
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:07,516
What are you gonna do about...

1137
01:15:10,731 --> 01:15:12,048
I don't know.

1138
01:15:13,104 --> 01:15:14,677
I'll fix it up tomorrow.

1139
01:15:14,939 --> 01:15:17,356
You were pretty close to
something there, Fred.

1140
01:15:18,462 --> 01:15:21,182
- Yeah.
- Maybe you aren't out yet.

1141
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:23,830
She'll get over it.

1142
01:15:24,268 --> 01:15:26,061
I was thinking more about you.

1143
01:15:26,652 --> 01:15:27,689
Forget it!

1144
01:15:28,856 --> 01:15:30,873
Mind if I get a little
drunk with you, Fred?

1145
01:15:32,275 --> 01:15:35,384
So you went noble, eh?
Hallelujah, brother!

1146
01:15:43,048 --> 01:15:44,092
Come here.

1147
01:15:44,127 --> 01:15:47,273
- Why! Mr. Carson!
- Come here, you lug!

1148
01:15:47,408 --> 01:15:49,475
Well, it's about time!

1149
01:15:50,983 --> 01:15:52,753
Welcome home, stranger.

1150
01:15:53,956 --> 01:15:55,995
You're not a bad kid, Lily.

1151
01:15:57,435 --> 01:15:58,700
You know about us?

1152
01:15:59,211 --> 01:16:02,177
We belong here.
They don't, those two.

1153
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,903
Ah, it's a dirty rotten country.

1154
01:16:05,215 --> 01:16:07,711
And we're dirty rotten people,
I suppose, eh?

1155
01:16:07,746 --> 01:16:09,283
- Sure.
- Who is?

1156
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:11,311
- You are!
- Take that back!

1157
01:16:28,866 --> 01:16:29,918
Dennis!

1158
01:16:32,102 --> 01:16:33,766
Wouldn't you know it!

1159
01:16:37,103 --> 01:16:38,712
Sorry we woke you up.

1160
01:16:40,114 --> 01:16:41,122
Are you?

1161
01:16:41,384 --> 01:16:42,800
We were just kidding.

1162
01:16:44,670 --> 01:16:45,742
Dennis!

1163
01:16:46,443 --> 01:16:48,126
Well Fred, it's not too late.

1164
01:16:48,286 --> 01:16:49,860
I don't want you here!

1165
01:16:51,616 --> 01:16:53,632
Why, certainly.

1166
01:16:55,988 --> 01:16:59,353
Okay, Fred, you can check
the wings and halo at the desk.

1167
01:16:59,739 --> 01:17:01,569
- I'll be right up, Vantine.
- Dennis!

1168
01:17:01,743 --> 01:17:02,932
What?

1169
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:05,562
- What did you mean?
- I meant what I said.

1170
01:17:07,268 --> 01:17:10,452
- What's happened to you?
- Figure it out for yourself.

1171
01:17:11,486 --> 01:17:13,552
- You're drunk.
- Sure I'm drunk.

1172
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:16,680
That's why I'm telling you the truth.
You want to hear some more truth?

1173
01:17:17,637 --> 01:17:20,144
I didn't say anything to your husband
down there and I'm glad I didn't.

1174
01:17:20,179 --> 01:17:22,563
I've just been kidding you all the
time, and everybody knew about it.

1175
01:17:22,598 --> 01:17:24,221
- Stop it!
- If you want to come down here,

1176
01:17:24,256 --> 01:17:25,601
you come down under our rules.

1177
01:17:25,636 --> 01:17:28,016
And if you want to cheat on your
husband, that's okay with me.

1178
01:17:28,251 --> 01:17:30,322
And I'm the boy you're
looking for. - Stop it!

1179
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:31,521
And let me tell you this:

1180
01:17:32,806 --> 01:17:35,936
I'm not a one-woman man, I never
have been and I never will be.

1181
01:17:36,357 --> 01:17:37,792
And if you wanna take your turn...

1182
01:17:43,234 --> 01:17:46,294
All right, if it makes
you feel any better.

1183
01:17:50,848 --> 01:17:52,968
- Denny!
- I'm hit.

1184
01:17:53,275 --> 01:17:54,285
Where?

1185
01:17:55,047 --> 01:17:56,169
I'm finding out.

1186
01:17:56,677 --> 01:17:59,459
- No bull's eye?
- Naw!

1187
01:18:02,972 --> 01:18:04,146
Babs!

1188
01:18:04,739 --> 01:18:06,342
What's the matter? What happened?

1189
01:18:06,377 --> 01:18:09,134
- I shot him.
- Why?

1190
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:13,653
- Because he...because he...
- Because I made a pass at her.

1191
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:19,237
Oh, Gary! Help me.
Help me!

1192
01:18:26,502 --> 01:18:28,996
Then you haven't...
Guidon said that you and...

1193
01:18:29,131 --> 01:18:32,154
Guidon's a liar! You ought
to be proud of her.

1194
01:18:32,432 --> 01:18:34,305
This bozo's been after
her every minute.

1195
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:36,911
And tonight he comes in drunk
and tries to break into her room

1196
01:18:36,946 --> 01:18:37,988
and she shoots him.

1197
01:18:38,223 --> 01:18:41,400
The way any virtuous woman,
with a beast like that...

1198
01:18:42,471 --> 01:18:45,150
If I were you, Mr. Willis,
I'd take her away from here,

1199
01:18:45,185 --> 01:18:46,744
and the quicker the better.

1200
01:18:46,917 --> 01:18:48,304
And now, as long as
you aren't dead,

1201
01:18:48,339 --> 01:18:50,436
I suppose we'll have
to save your rotten life!

1202
01:18:50,571 --> 01:18:51,623
Hoy!

1203
01:18:52,018 --> 01:18:53,862
I thought you were a great guy.

1204
01:18:53,897 --> 01:18:55,179
Never mind about me.

1205
01:18:56,006 --> 01:18:58,175
The boat will get here
in the morning, see?

1206
01:18:58,286 --> 01:19:01,240
You two pack your tennis rackets
and go back where you belong.

1207
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:03,387
I'll do that all right.

1208
01:19:05,012 --> 01:19:07,168
If she hadn't plugged you,
I'd have done it myself.

1209
01:19:07,533 --> 01:19:08,679
Come on, Babs.

1210
01:19:08,801 --> 01:19:11,723
Oh, Gary, I'm so sorry!

1211
01:19:12,093 --> 01:19:14,234
So sorry.
- Sorry, nothing.

1212
01:19:15,456 --> 01:19:16,798
I'm proud of you.

1213
01:19:26,196 --> 01:19:28,542
Oh, Denny!
Denny, does it hurt awful?

1214
01:19:28,674 --> 01:19:30,428
Oh, stop blubbering.

1215
01:19:30,463 --> 01:19:32,464
You've been using your head
pretty well up to now.

1216
01:19:32,731 --> 01:19:34,624
Get me the medicine kit.
- Okay.

1217
01:19:36,331 --> 01:19:40,332
Oh, Mr. Denny...Mr. Denny...

1218
01:19:40,732 --> 01:19:43,773
Oh, shut up! Go heat some water.
- Yes sir!

1219
01:19:46,055 --> 01:19:49,095
- Medicine kit coming up.
- That's more like it.

1220
01:19:50,765 --> 01:19:52,182
Give me the iodine.

1221
01:20:01,059 --> 01:20:02,440
Here now...

1222
01:20:02,524 --> 01:20:05,124
Press that thing through there
and pull it out the other end.

1223
01:20:05,302 --> 01:20:08,228
You mean, push the bullet
out or something?

1224
01:20:09,044 --> 01:20:11,904
No, that bullet's 50 yards
out in the compound.

1225
01:20:11,938 --> 01:20:13,308
Come on, clean out that hole!

1226
01:20:13,524 --> 01:20:15,529
- Oh, Denny!
- Come on.

1227
01:20:15,711 --> 01:20:17,258
One for the money...

1228
01:20:18,763 --> 01:20:20,050
Two for...

1229
01:20:21,023 --> 01:20:22,624
Two for the show.

1230
01:20:23,050 --> 01:20:26,084
- Three to get ready...
- Oh, Denny!

1231
01:20:26,287 --> 01:20:27,991
Come on, hurry up, you sap!

1232
01:20:31,044 --> 01:20:33,283
Four to...go.

1233
01:20:37,758 --> 01:20:40,242
Come on, all the way through.

1234
01:20:43,746 --> 01:20:46,219
It was something I overlooked.

1235
01:20:49,037 --> 01:20:52,581
"And the next day, when the big
round sun was high in the heaven,

1236
01:20:52,792 --> 01:20:55,616
little Bobby Chipmunk could
hardly believe his eyes,

1237
01:20:55,684 --> 01:21:00,461
because there across Farmer Brown's
meadows he saw little Molly Cottontail."

1238
01:21:02,145 --> 01:21:06,160
A chipmunk and a rabbit!
Say I wonder how this comes out.

1239
01:21:06,754 --> 01:21:08,731
"But the faster he ran
across the ground,

1240
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:12,323
the faster she went,
hippity hop hippity hop..."

1241
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,992
Fred! Stop it!

1242
01:21:14,085 --> 01:21:17,955
Sorry. Once more and you
get the works right there!

1243
01:21:19,714 --> 01:21:22,419
Can't you read anything
but bedtime stories?

1244
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:25,000
I've read you everything
four times.

1245
01:21:25,761 --> 01:21:29,152
Except one certain item.
- What?

1246
01:21:29,386 --> 01:21:32,874
Well, I didn't want to upset you.
You're not well yet, you know.

1247
01:21:33,001 --> 01:21:35,157
- Let me see.
- I'll read it.

1248
01:21:36,027 --> 01:21:37,691
Where is it?

1249
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:43,017
Here: "Sailing for San Francisco
on the Mohawa Maroo,

1250
01:21:43,311 --> 01:21:46,544
was Mr. Gary Willis and
his attractive wife of...

1251
01:21:47,037 --> 01:21:50,549
Look how they spelled
"Philadelphia"! "Ffil".

1252
01:21:51,013 --> 01:21:53,095
Well anyway, let's see now.

1253
01:21:55,048 --> 01:21:56,693
"Way across the meadow..."

1254
01:21:58,056 --> 01:21:59,757
Come on Fred, shake out of it.

1255
01:22:02,014 --> 01:22:06,166
"Way across the meadow, as old Daddy
Sun was setting behind the purple hills,

1256
01:22:06,299 --> 01:22:11,057
little Molly Cottontail went
hippity hop, hippity hop..."

1257
01:22:12,385 --> 01:22:14,101
Fred?

1258
01:22:14,726 --> 01:22:15,935
What, Lily?

1259
01:22:16,036 --> 01:22:17,616
You big cheese!

1260
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:20,559
Roquefort or gorgonzola?

1261
01:22:27,087 --> 01:22:29,905
Me come again, peep peep!
