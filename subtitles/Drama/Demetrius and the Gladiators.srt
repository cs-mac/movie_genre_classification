1
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,708
Then, Christians, die you shall!

2
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:19,952
Go! Both of you!

3
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:22,118
Into your kingdom!

4
00:00:44,858 --> 00:00:46,849
For the big fisherman.

5
00:03:22,339 --> 00:03:25,244
Prefect. Where's the prefect 
of the guard?

6
00:03:25,286 --> 00:03:26,653
Here, sire.

7
00:03:26,968 --> 00:03:30,466
- How long till sunrise?
- Two hours, sire.

8
00:03:56,204 --> 00:03:58,195
My lady.

9
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,482
Wait here.

10
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:03,840
Open.

11
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,490
- Where's Claudius?
- In his own room.

12
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:12,064
Doesn't your husband 
sleep here?

13
00:04:20,852 --> 00:04:24,739
- Well, what have you to report?
- This is very interesting, sire.

14
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:28,371
This is the report of Pontius Pilate,
our governor in Jerusalem.

15
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,583
The legends of a Messiah 
have said to...

16
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,736
Don't waste my
time with legends.

17
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:38,029
I want to know one thing.
Gallio and the lady Diana...

18
00:04:38,202 --> 00:04:41,163
...why weren't they afraid to die?

19
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:43,840
Perhaps they're not dead, sire.

20
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:47,351
- Not dead?
- According to their superstition.

21
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:50,703
Their king, this Jesus,
claims to have "overcome death...

22
00:04:50,922 --> 00:04:54,392
...not only for himself,
but for all who had faith in him".

23
00:04:54,634 --> 00:04:57,228
These are his words
as a spy reported them.

24
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:02,275
You mean those Christians thought
they were going to live for ever?

25
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:03,486
Ridiculous.

26
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,419
Of course, but the point is 
they believed it.

27
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,159
Therefore 
they were not afraid.

28
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:11,745
Everyone's afraid of death.

29
00:05:12,693 --> 00:05:15,082
Take you, my dear uncle.

30
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,486
Are you prepared to die now?

31
00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:19,828
Of course you're not.

32
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:23,586
You're sweating.
Your knees are shaking.

33
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:26,296
Very amusing.

34
00:05:26,456 --> 00:05:30,972
Death's one inch from your heart,
one little push on the dagger.

35
00:05:31,252 --> 00:05:33,129
Shall I, Claudius?

36
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:36,606
If you do, sire,
my knees will stop shaking...

37
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:38,911
...I will not sweat any more.

38
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:42,085
I won't be half as amusing dead
as I am alive.

39
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:45,565
The question is: are you alive?

40
00:05:47,184 --> 00:05:49,493
Would you say so, Messalina?

41
00:05:49,686 --> 00:05:52,678
As his wife, you're in the best
position to know.

42
00:05:54,107 --> 00:05:56,746
My devotion to my husband
is well known, sire.

43
00:05:56,943 --> 00:05:59,377
It's the talk of the Forum.

44
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,164
And your devotion 
to your emperor?

45
00:06:03,657 --> 00:06:06,251
Your wife is truly beautiful, Uncle.

46
00:06:07,745 --> 00:06:10,464
Except for her ears.

47
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:13,053
They're shaped like keyholes.

48
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:16,571
Who are your spies at court?

49
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:21,246
Never mind. I'll find out.

50
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:32,378
Suppose it were true. Suppose this Jesus
had found the secret of eternal life.

51
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:36,605
It's only superstition, sire.
Philosophers have disproved the idea...

52
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:40,037
Philosophers!
Their brains are full of mildew!

53
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:47,237
I have the power of life and death
over every being in the empire!

54
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,687
My power is as great
as any god's! True?

55
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,380
- True, sire.
- Then why should I have to die?

56
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:58,501
Why should I have to suffer death
like any plebeian, any slave?

57
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,549
- Is that logical? Is it?
- No, sire.

58
00:07:06,049 --> 00:07:08,040
Perhaps there was a spell.

59
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,751
A spell to make one immortal.

60
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:13,670
Like a god.

61
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:17,522
What have you found out
about the robe?

62
00:07:17,727 --> 00:07:19,877
- The robe?
- Yes. The robe.

63
00:07:20,062 --> 00:07:22,053
The robe of this Jesus.

64
00:07:22,231 --> 00:07:25,906
Tribune Gallio was carrying it
at his trial today. Where is it?

65
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:29,063
The lady Diana gave it to a slave
as she left the hall.

66
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,316
She said something about it
being for the fisherman.

67
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:34,602
Fisherman.

68
00:07:34,784 --> 00:07:36,581
Yes, that fits.

69
00:07:36,745 --> 00:07:39,862
One of their leaders
is called the fisherman.

70
00:07:40,081 --> 00:07:44,359
You're observant, Messalina.
It may please me to reward you.

71
00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:48,105
I wouldn't let her
sleep alone, Uncle.

72
00:07:48,297 --> 00:07:50,891
No one in this palace
can be trusted.

73
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:56,631
Prefect! 
Prefect of the guard!

74
00:07:56,847 --> 00:08:00,362
He's calling for his guards to find him
the robe to bring him eternal life.

75
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,591
- He's mad.
- No.

76
00:08:02,602 --> 00:08:05,103
Quite logical, when you consider 
that most of the emperors...

77
00:08:05,128 --> 00:08:07,184
...go more or less mad.

78
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,353
Every emperor stakes his life
on the loyalty of the Praetorian Guards.

79
00:08:11,486 --> 00:08:14,762
So if they can keep him alive at all,
why not for ever?

80
00:08:14,989 --> 00:08:16,422
He nearly killed you.

81
00:08:16,574 --> 00:08:20,283
Men do not kill what they despise.
Only what they fear.

82
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:24,828
Why don't you send
for a slave to do that?

83
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,190
Or do you enjoy
being on your knees?

84
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,899
With a tyrant, 
it's better to live on your knees...

85
00:08:29,924 --> 00:08:32,154
...than stand erect 
and be killed.

86
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:36,097
And you have the blood
of the Caesars in you.

87
00:08:36,342 --> 00:08:38,731
Rome was full of heroes once.

88
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:42,576
They're all dead...

89
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:44,968
...and their wives are widows.

90
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,517
Our friends, Marcellus and Diana,
are with Him.

91
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:58,928
Let us not mourn them.

92
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:00,911
Let us rather envy them...

93
00:09:00,913 --> 00:09:03,454
...that they could go joyfully 
and with pride in the service...

94
00:09:03,473 --> 00:09:05,728
...of their belief.

95
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:08,392
Jesus spoke to us of death...

96
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,936
...the night he faced his own.

97
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,514
The night they took him 
before Pilate.

98
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:16,934
It was our last supper together.

99
00:09:18,006 --> 00:09:21,794
After we had risen from the table,
he washed our feet...

100
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:25,206
...and then he spoke.

101
00:09:26,514 --> 00:09:29,950
He told us that in his Father's house
are many mansions.

102
00:09:30,184 --> 00:09:33,301
That he went to prepare
a place for us there.

103
00:09:33,521 --> 00:09:37,480
"And where I am," he said,
"there you may be also."

104
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:44,577
Our friends are
in our Father's house.

105
00:09:45,907 --> 00:09:49,104
Some day we'll all walk
that same road...

106
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:52,960
...and at its end we'll find them.

107
00:09:53,164 --> 00:09:55,314
Find our master.

108
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,968
His everlasting love.

109
00:09:59,837 --> 00:10:00,877
Amen.

110
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:02,310
- Amen.
- Amen.

111
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:12,208
I know what you say
is true, Peter.

112
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:14,714
But it's still in my mind...

113
00:10:14,717 --> 00:10:17,817
...that only yesterday 
they were warm with life.

114
00:10:18,104 --> 00:10:20,664
Young, breathing...

115
00:10:20,857 --> 00:10:23,052
...laughing.

116
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:25,623
- Now it's...
- They never doubted.

117
00:10:30,282 --> 00:10:32,750
I'm sorry, Peter...

118
00:10:32,952 --> 00:10:34,544
...but I loved them so much.

119
00:10:34,703 --> 00:10:38,829
Even Jesus himself on the cross
thought he was forsaken.

120
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:45,536
I remember.

121
00:10:47,465 --> 00:10:50,775
Only you, of all of us here,
have that memory.

122
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,240
You saw him on his cross.

123
00:10:53,429 --> 00:10:57,866
But we all saw desolation
give way to joy, death to life.

124
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,280
Friends, while I'm away
in the north...

125
00:11:03,522 --> 00:11:07,197
...Demetrius will be
my eyes, my ears, my voice.

126
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:11,463
Come to him with your problems
as you would come to me.

127
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:17,107
This was our master's robe.

128
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:20,269
He wore it
when he healed the sick.

129
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:22,968
He wore it when he comforted
the sorrowing.

130
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:27,875
He wore it when he spoke to the multitudes
as no man has ever spoken.

131
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,090
He wore it when he went
to the cross to die for us.

132
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,503
Keep it for me.

133
00:11:35,677 --> 00:11:37,668
Keep it.

134
00:11:38,346 --> 00:11:40,735
You saved it for us.

135
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:45,235
God be with you all.

136
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,387
- God be with you, Peter.
- God be with you, Peter.

137
00:12:34,732 --> 00:12:36,723
Good morning, Demetrius.

138
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:40,655
- You never make a mistake, do you, Kaeso?
- I'd know your step anywhere.

139
00:12:40,905 --> 00:12:43,021
- Peter's safely on the road.
- Good.

140
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:45,110
- Have you had your breakfast?
- No.

141
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:48,356
Lucia will get it for you. Lucia!

142
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:49,807
Lucia!

143
00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:52,233
- Where is that girl?
- Coming.

144
00:12:56,628 --> 00:12:59,549
- Demetrius has had no food.
- It's ready.

145
00:13:07,096 --> 00:13:08,343
Here's your breakfast.

146
00:13:08,348 --> 00:13:10,837
I saved you some apricots. 
I know you like them.

147
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,250
- I hid them for you.
- Thank you.

148
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:17,633
If there was only one apricot left
in the world, she'd give it to you.

149
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:23,593
Peter gave me our master's robe
to keep for him.

150
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,423
- May I?
- Of course.

151
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:37,861
I never thought of Jesus
as being so tall.

152
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,473
- Was he as tall as you, Demetrius?
- Just about the same.

153
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,546
You'd think his robe
would be made of silk and gold.

154
00:13:45,757 --> 00:13:49,193
He was a carpenter.
All his life he'd worked with his hands.

155
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:52,225
- Like us.
- Just like us.

156
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:27,511
By order of the emperor,
I am authorised to pay 20 pieces of gold...

157
00:14:27,963 --> 00:14:30,636
...for information
concerning the robe...

158
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:34,122
...which once belonged
to the criminal called Jesus...

159
00:14:34,762 --> 00:14:37,959
...crucified
for sedition in Jerusalem.

160
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:42,981
Well? 20 pieces of gold.

161
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:47,910
The penalty
for concealment is death!

162
00:14:49,108 --> 00:14:51,099
Start the search!

163
00:15:03,121 --> 00:15:05,157
Anyone here 
know of this robe?

164
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:08,619
It's said to be of homespun,
red in colour.

165
00:15:10,587 --> 00:15:12,817
Are you slave or free here?

166
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:14,724
I am a born freeman.

167
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:16,793
All the others have been freed.

168
00:15:16,968 --> 00:15:18,765
Christians?

169
00:15:22,515 --> 00:15:25,905
I'll have a look around.
Get back to your work.

170
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:32,430
You! Come back here!

171
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:39,451
No!

172
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,846
Why did you run? 
Why did you...

173
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:24,378
Demetrius of Corinth.

174
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:26,699
Assaulting a decurion
of the Praetorian Guard...

175
00:16:26,741 --> 00:16:28,538
...in the execution of his duties.

176
00:16:28,702 --> 00:16:31,217
- Is the decurion here?
- Here, sir.

177
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:39,249
The evidence seems impressive.
Are you slave or free?

178
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,119
Free, sir.

179
00:16:42,673 --> 00:16:44,982
Mark of a slave, sir.

180
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:47,484
I was a slave,
but my master freed me, sir.

181
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:50,135
A slave may be freed by
emancipation before a praetor...

182
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:51,890
...inscription
on the censor's record...

183
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:55,464
...testament on death of master
or declaration before witnesses.

184
00:16:55,518 --> 00:16:58,679
- Can you provide proof of any of these?
- No, sir.

185
00:16:58,897 --> 00:17:02,333
- Were you bought or born to the house?
- Bought, sir.

186
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,558
Where is your master?

187
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,718
Dead.

188
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,752
A Greek should be able
to invent a better story than that.

189
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:13,243
Flavius, do you think
he'd make a gladiator?

190
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:15,485
Look at the decurion's face!

191
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:19,598
Sentenced to be trained
for the arena.

192
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:35,593
- Where is the master?
- Strabo!

193
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,881
- More prisoners.
- Open up.

194
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,040
You prisoners are lucky
to be sentenced to train...

195
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:54,792
...as gladiators
in the Claudian school...

196
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:57,043
...rather than to one
of the imperial schools.

197
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,469
This is the best.

198
00:17:58,473 --> 00:18:00,808
We have the best trainers,
the best physicians...

199
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:04,305
...to watch over your skins,
your health, your food.

200
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,338
We'll feed you well
and dress you well.

201
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,980
You'll have meat at every meal.

202
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,862
Gladiators trained in this school 
are sought after...

203
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:17,392
...for the most important
festival games...

204
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:20,872
...and also for the emperor's
private enclosure.

205
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:23,772
That's because
we have an iron motto:

206
00:18:23,976 --> 00:18:27,013
"We live well, we die well."

207
00:18:27,229 --> 00:18:29,220
Unchain them.

208
00:18:30,941 --> 00:18:33,371
It may seem to you
that in being sentenced to this place...

209
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,880
...you're being sentenced 
to death.

210
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,890
That's not necessarily true.

211
00:18:37,114 --> 00:18:40,924
I, Strabo, was sentenced here
as you are, but I fought well.

212
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:44,743
I won fame and a fortune, too.
And I won my freedom.

213
00:18:44,996 --> 00:18:47,880
The emperor himself
calls me by name.

214
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:52,090
Even the most famous of the charioteers
has to give way to me.

215
00:18:52,712 --> 00:18:55,595
I fought 52 times in the arena.

216
00:18:56,173 --> 00:18:58,511
I killed 52 men.

217
00:18:59,968 --> 00:19:02,295
Perhaps one of you 
will do as well.

218
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:04,852
Come.

219
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,108
Dardanius here
is the best of netmen.

220
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:14,007
You've seen his name often 
where the girls have scratched it...

221
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:15,769
...on the walls of Rome.

222
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,581
He likes the way we live here.
He likes to kill. He's a born butcher.

223
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:25,806
But he can have his choice
of fair ladies. Tonight he will.

224
00:19:25,848 --> 00:19:28,613
And so will you
when you're ready for the arena.

225
00:19:30,372 --> 00:19:35,002
Glycon was a king in his own country.
Now he's the king of swordsmen.

226
00:19:35,293 --> 00:19:38,627
Learn to use a sword like him
and you may well earn your freedom...

227
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:42,220
...as he'll earn his very soon,
perhaps tomorrow.

228
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:51,366
You'll train with wooden swords
till you're ready for the steel.

229
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,976
These men here 
will fight tomorrow.

230
00:20:04,154 --> 00:20:07,316
Half of them will live,
half of them will die.

231
00:20:07,615 --> 00:20:09,606
They know it.

232
00:20:11,285 --> 00:20:13,753
Some men who are sent here
don't seem to like it.

233
00:20:13,954 --> 00:20:17,341
They'd rather live badly than die well,
so they try to escape.

234
00:20:17,374 --> 00:20:19,365
Like this one.

235
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,813
All his training was wasted.

236
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:26,884
He dies badly
like a common criminal.

237
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,322
Try to escape
and this is your reward.

238
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:32,500
Strabo, Claudius is arriving.

239
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:34,614
Line up the men 
who fight tomorrow.

240
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:36,964
You're luckier 
than most recruits.

241
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,782
On your first day 
you'll see the owner of the school.

242
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:41,776
Come.

243
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:02,538
My lord Claudius.

244
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:04,527
My lady.

245
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:07,299
So these are the men, eh?

246
00:21:08,172 --> 00:21:11,086
Well, I hope you drew up
a better list than last time.

247
00:21:11,128 --> 00:21:13,351
They know it's for
a special occasion, my lord.

248
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:15,543
Oh. Probus.

249
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:19,130
Dardanius.

250
00:21:20,851 --> 00:21:23,001
Barak. Good.

251
00:21:23,812 --> 00:21:26,565
Tomorrow is the emperor's birthday.

252
00:21:26,773 --> 00:21:30,607
You men will have the honour
of competing in the palace itself...

253
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,249
...in the emperor's private arena.

254
00:21:33,446 --> 00:21:36,119
I expect you to make
a good impression.

255
00:21:36,323 --> 00:21:39,338
You are my birthday present
to Caligula.

256
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,924
They'll do you proud, my lord.

257
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,473
Every man has sworn 
to die well if he has to.

258
00:21:43,515 --> 00:21:45,196
To die with style.

259
00:21:45,248 --> 00:21:47,463
I've also let them know
there's something special...

260
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:50,714
...in the way of entertainment tonight, 
thanks to our lady.

261
00:21:51,963 --> 00:21:53,954
Say a word to them, my lady.

262
00:21:58,678 --> 00:22:02,193
I'm sending you a feast
prepared in my own kitchens.

263
00:22:02,431 --> 00:22:05,662
Rare delicacies from every province
of the empire...

264
00:22:05,893 --> 00:22:08,518
...and wine
from the imperial cellars...

265
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:12,563
...packed in snow and brought
by runners from the Alps.

266
00:22:12,816 --> 00:22:16,331
I can assure you the rest
of the entertainment will be...

267
00:22:16,762 --> 00:22:19,166
...of the very highest quality.

268
00:22:20,323 --> 00:22:22,845
Guard! Guard!

269
00:22:22,887 --> 00:22:25,307
Lock the gate!
Stay where you are!

270
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,712
Mark him!

271
00:22:27,872 --> 00:22:30,548
- Stay where you are.
- Stop him!

272
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,073
Stop him! Mark him!

273
00:22:33,377 --> 00:22:35,174
Lock the gate!

274
00:22:48,182 --> 00:22:50,963
The best prospect of the lot 
had to be a coward.

275
00:22:51,005 --> 00:22:52,802
- I'm no coward.
- Then why did you run?

276
00:22:52,844 --> 00:22:55,238
- Bind him!
- Wait.

277
00:22:58,275 --> 00:23:00,266
Why did you run?

278
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:03,055
I don't think you're a coward.

279
00:23:03,097 --> 00:23:06,246
You had no real chance of escaping. 
You must have known that.

280
00:23:06,783 --> 00:23:10,416
This is a place where men are trained
to kill each other like animals.

281
00:23:11,371 --> 00:23:14,708
- And men aren't animals?
- No.

282
00:23:15,141 --> 00:23:19,367
We admire a magnificent animal who fights.
Why not a man who fights?

283
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:22,256
Because God didn't put man on earth
to destroy his own kind...

284
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:25,183
...nor a woman to enjoy
their agonies as they die.

285
00:23:25,185 --> 00:23:26,876
- Dog!
- Wait.

286
00:23:28,011 --> 00:23:30,525
- What's your name?
- Demetrius.

287
00:23:30,722 --> 00:23:34,128
You spoke of a god, Demetrius.
Which god?

288
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:36,800
There is only one God.

289
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:40,679
He's one of them.
This is very interesting.

290
00:23:40,773 --> 00:23:42,172
A Christian.

291
00:23:42,316 --> 00:23:45,047
- Are you a Christian?
- Yes.

292
00:23:45,052 --> 00:23:47,218
- And you won't fight?
- No.

293
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,627
He can't, my dear. 
It's against his religion to kill.

294
00:23:50,968 --> 00:23:52,547
We'll see about that.

295
00:23:53,095 --> 00:23:54,508
- Strabo.
- Yes, my lady.

296
00:23:54,508 --> 00:23:56,134
Put him in the arena 
tomorrow afternoon.

297
00:23:56,176 --> 00:23:59,722
Messalina, he won't fight.
You know what Caligula will do.

298
00:23:59,764 --> 00:24:02,422
I'm more interested in what
this Christian will do...

299
00:24:02,627 --> 00:24:07,222
...when he sees
that his choice is kill or die.

300
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,921
Here they come!

301
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:32,945
Look, Dardanius!

302
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,360
Sit here and watch the game.

303
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:38,637
- Watch me win this.
- Get on with the play.

304
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:50,418
You may see a few things 
you didn't bargain for, my lady.

305
00:24:50,443 --> 00:24:52,173
These men 
aren't exactly children.

306
00:24:52,178 --> 00:24:54,335
They know that half of them
will be dead tomorrow night.

307
00:24:54,347 --> 00:24:56,874
I'll try not
to be shocked, Strabo.

308
00:25:12,151 --> 00:25:14,142
Your name is Demetrius?

309
00:25:21,576 --> 00:25:24,261
I'm from Corinth, like you.

310
00:25:25,455 --> 00:25:27,685
This is my first time here.

311
00:25:27,874 --> 00:25:30,870
- Do you always eat like this?
- I don't know.

312
00:25:31,002 --> 00:25:32,993
This is my first time, too.

313
00:25:33,921 --> 00:25:35,912
And you're fighting tomorrow!

314
00:25:37,424 --> 00:25:39,301
You must be a famous warrior.

315
00:25:39,468 --> 00:25:41,429
I'm a potter.

316
00:25:42,846 --> 00:25:46,886
Only a potter? And they're sending
you into the arena tomorrow?

317
00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:50,073
You must have done
something awfully bad.

318
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,067
I did.

319
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,221
I'm a Christian.

320
00:25:56,442 --> 00:25:58,034
Strabo...

321
00:25:58,194 --> 00:26:02,790
...when you were fighting in the arena
what did you think about the night before?

322
00:26:03,073 --> 00:26:05,871
It doesn't pay a gladiator
to think, my lady.

323
00:26:06,577 --> 00:26:09,045
When you caressed a woman...

324
00:26:09,246 --> 00:26:12,636
...was your mind on her
or on death?

325
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,635
You don't expect to die.
You never think it'll be you that gets it.

326
00:26:18,213 --> 00:26:21,205
There's only one man down there
who knows he's going to die.

327
00:26:21,674 --> 00:26:25,872
You're wrong, Strabo.
When the time comes, he'll fight...

328
00:26:26,137 --> 00:26:28,933
...because he wants to live,
like any other man.

329
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:31,429
My lady, I tried to teach him
something this afternoon.

330
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:34,547
He wouldn't make a move to defend himself.
Wouldn't even pick up the sword.

331
00:26:34,561 --> 00:26:36,755
And he admitted 
he was a warrior once.

332
00:26:36,797 --> 00:26:40,132
He was brought to Rome
as a prisoner of war, but he won't fight.

333
00:26:40,174 --> 00:26:41,767
Why, you...

334
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:50,212
All right, you're out of the game.
Get back.

335
00:26:50,215 --> 00:26:52,660
He's out. 
Come on, whose throw?

336
00:26:53,004 --> 00:26:55,130
- Mine. Let's go.
- Throw the dice.

337
00:26:55,331 --> 00:26:57,128
Watch this one.

338
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:00,992
The stakes must be high.

339
00:27:02,212 --> 00:27:04,139
They're gambling
for a longer life.

340
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:06,889
The winner gets me
for his opponent tomorrow.

341
00:27:08,885 --> 00:27:10,477
Venus. I threw Venus.

342
00:27:12,805 --> 00:27:14,796
I win.

343
00:27:26,318 --> 00:27:28,309
I won you, Christian.

344
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:31,020
Tomorrow you're mine.

345
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,390
Now I want to show you something.

346
00:27:34,576 --> 00:27:36,612
Watch.

347
00:27:36,786 --> 00:27:39,386
Is it true that 
when you strike a Christian...

348
00:27:39,886 --> 00:27:41,660
...he must turn 
the other cheek?

349
00:27:45,753 --> 00:27:48,848
Well, go ahead. Turn the other cheek.
Let's see you.

350
00:27:58,432 --> 00:28:00,627
Anyone else?

351
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:02,800
I am no Christian.

352
00:28:12,194 --> 00:28:15,464
- Who is he?
- Glycon, the Nubian.

353
00:28:15,506 --> 00:28:18,390
My lord Claudius has been considering
giving him his freedom.

354
00:28:18,617 --> 00:28:20,750
Oh, yes. I remember.

355
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:27,084
Have him fight
the Christian tomorrow.

356
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:30,462
That should make it
even more interesting.

357
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:36,692
Listen to me.

358
00:28:37,672 --> 00:28:41,007
The worst sort of life is better 
than the best kind of death.

359
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:43,591
Forget your religion
for just one day.

360
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:46,227
Kill him. He is no good.

361
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:48,710
Your god will thank you for it.

362
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:51,512
Thank you for what you did.

363
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:56,731
This god of yours...

364
00:28:56,861 --> 00:29:01,679
They say he thought as well of a slave
as of a patrician, even an emperor.

365
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:03,884
Can this be true?

366
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:07,428
It was one of the greatest
of his truths.

367
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:10,544
No wonder they crucified him.

368
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:18,416
The gladiators have arrived
at the palace enclosure, sire.

369
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,638
Well? What have you to report?

370
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,181
The robe is no longer 
in Rome, sire.

371
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,442
The man who has it, 
the one they call the fisherman...

372
00:29:28,484 --> 00:29:30,628
...is said to have left 
the city and gone north.

373
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:34,230
- I've issued orders to...
- I want the robe, not excuses!

374
00:29:34,313 --> 00:29:36,304
Find it!

375
00:29:36,982 --> 00:29:41,929
I hope you've provided better
entertainment than last time, Uncle.

376
00:30:32,117 --> 00:30:34,073
Senators...

377
00:30:34,244 --> 00:30:36,041
...my subjects...

378
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,139
...my loyal guards...

379
00:30:39,332 --> 00:30:41,562
...we are touched by your devotion.

380
00:30:41,751 --> 00:30:43,848
In honour of our birthday...

381
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:48,660
...a gift of 50 gold pieces 
for every member of the guard.

382
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,546
We will proceed now
with the marriage of life and death.

383
00:32:34,482 --> 00:32:36,313
Hail Caesar!

384
00:32:36,484 --> 00:32:39,922
We, who are about to die,
salute you.

385
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,307
Begin the games!

386
00:34:33,802 --> 00:34:35,793
Get ready.

387
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,630
Demetrius. Glycon.

388
00:34:48,357 --> 00:34:50,348
Take it.

389
00:34:53,487 --> 00:34:56,056
There's one chance for you.
A slim one.

390
00:34:56,098 --> 00:34:58,454
- Have you ever used a sword?
- Yes.

391
00:34:58,659 --> 00:35:02,975
Fight as hard as you can.
Try to kill me. Use your shield well.

392
00:35:02,996 --> 00:35:06,551
Sometimes, very rarely,
if two men put up a good enough fight...

393
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:07,915
...they let them both live.

394
00:35:07,957 --> 00:35:08,968
Do you understand?

395
00:35:09,085 --> 00:35:12,309
If they think we're pretending,
they'll cut our throats.

396
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:16,834
If they begin to guess, defend yourself,
because then I'll have to kill you.

397
00:35:31,022 --> 00:35:33,388
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

398
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,174
- That's Glycon, isn't it?
- Yes, sire.

399
00:35:40,216 --> 00:35:43,298
Good. I don't know 
the other one.

400
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,917
A Greek. 
A most unusual man, sire.

401
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:48,004
We thought 
he might amuse you.

402
00:35:53,544 --> 00:35:56,342
Cut hard at me,
make it look good. Attack!

403
00:36:12,478 --> 00:36:17,246
It's poor, Claudius.
Your gladiators are too fond of each other.

404
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:36,762
It's no good. They know.
Sorry, friend. Fight for your life.

405
00:37:09,365 --> 00:37:13,258
- Glycon, pick up your sword.
- I can't. You've won.

406
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:17,559
Look, Glycon. It's life.

407
00:37:17,747 --> 00:37:20,330
Not yet. 
The emperor decides.

408
00:37:22,919 --> 00:37:25,132
They want him spared, sire.

409
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,871
Cut clean, friend.

410
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,803
Sire, I'm a freeman of Rome.

411
00:37:40,018 --> 00:37:42,470
I claim my right of appeal 
to the emperor.

412
00:37:42,495 --> 00:37:44,832
Your rights 
are what I say they are.

413
00:37:45,065 --> 00:37:46,657
But you may speak.

414
00:37:46,816 --> 00:37:49,252
I ask you to withdraw
your command, sire.

415
00:37:49,256 --> 00:37:50,799
Why should I?

416
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:54,338
I'm a Christian.
I can't take a man's life.

417
00:37:54,782 --> 00:37:56,500
Very well.

418
00:37:56,659 --> 00:37:58,729
Your request is granted.

419
00:37:58,911 --> 00:38:02,512
- The Nubian goes free.
- Thank you, sire.

420
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:13,295
Christian!

421
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:15,457
Stay there!

422
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:24,761
Macro, go down and cut
the dog's throat.

423
00:38:24,977 --> 00:38:26,774
Take your time with it.

424
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,928
Let him die slowly.

425
00:38:29,148 --> 00:38:33,054
Sire, is that worthy of you?
A man who won't even fight back?

426
00:38:33,096 --> 00:38:34,774
What do you mean not worthy?

427
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:37,595
Are you daring
to plead for his life?

428
00:38:37,637 --> 00:38:40,042
I'm only thinking
of your own amusement.

429
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:44,177
Why waste his death?
Make him a birthday present to your tigers.

430
00:38:44,787 --> 00:38:47,828
I think I begin
to understand, Claudius.

431
00:38:47,874 --> 00:38:50,786
She wants him
to have a chance for life.

432
00:38:51,002 --> 00:38:53,800
I didn't know your taste
ran to Christians.

433
00:38:53,804 --> 00:38:55,605
- Did you, Claudius?
- It doesn't, sire.

434
00:38:55,965 --> 00:38:57,956
Your eyes betray you.

435
00:38:59,134 --> 00:39:00,931
Very well.

436
00:39:01,094 --> 00:39:05,042
When the tigers are finished with him
you won't want what's left.

437
00:39:06,224 --> 00:39:08,294
Macro...

438
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:10,971
...give him the dagger
and come back.

439
00:39:22,823 --> 00:39:25,709
Release the tigers!

440
00:43:06,616 --> 00:43:09,878
- He's lost much blood, my lady.
- I want him to live.

441
00:43:13,081 --> 00:43:15,780
- What are you doing?
- We are going to bleed him, my lady.

442
00:43:15,822 --> 00:43:17,146
The blood of slaves is impure.

443
00:43:17,171 --> 00:43:19,795
We thought letting some out
to improve his health.

444
00:43:19,837 --> 00:43:22,095
Bleed him when his trouble
is loss of blood?

445
00:43:22,137 --> 00:43:23,955
Get out, both of you!

446
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,633
The fools. 
Who can be trusted?

447
00:43:27,844 --> 00:43:29,835
I'll stay with him, my lady.

448
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,878
Get blankets. He should be kept warm.
And heat some wine for him.

449
00:43:35,143 --> 00:43:37,134
Heated wine.

450
00:43:53,785 --> 00:43:55,913
I wish I knew 
how to pray to his god.

451
00:43:55,938 --> 00:43:58,963
Save your breath.
The wine will do him more good.

452
00:43:59,249 --> 00:44:02,632
- I make you responsible, Strabo.
- I'll do everything I can, my lady.

453
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:05,230
If he dies,
I'll send you back to the arena.

454
00:44:17,385 --> 00:44:19,376
Leave us.

455
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:24,555
I understand I have you
to thank for my life.

456
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,595
Caligula 
would have wasted you.

457
00:44:26,685 --> 00:44:29,438
You could become
a valuable piece of property.

458
00:44:29,646 --> 00:44:32,135
- Why did you send for me?
- I didn't.

459
00:44:32,177 --> 00:44:34,337
My husband 
wants to question you.

460
00:44:34,526 --> 00:44:36,842
- Claudius?
- Yes?

461
00:44:36,845 --> 00:44:40,046
- The slave Demetrius is here.
- I'm not a slave.

462
00:44:40,127 --> 00:44:43,464
You're our property,
whatever you want to call it.

463
00:44:43,506 --> 00:44:45,841
Good afternoon. 
I hope you're feeling better.

464
00:44:45,845 --> 00:44:46,928
Yes, sir.

465
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:49,606
If you could survive our physicians,
you could survive anything.

466
00:44:49,873 --> 00:44:53,210
But then it's hard to kill a man
who believes he'll live forever.

467
00:44:53,252 --> 00:44:57,003
- You do believe that, don't you?
- Claudius, come to the point.

468
00:44:57,045 --> 00:44:58,389
Oh, yes.

469
00:44:58,548 --> 00:45:02,671
The emperor is interested in the robe
that Jesus wore to the cross.

470
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,510
Can you tell me where to find it
or the whereabouts of the man who has it?

471
00:45:06,512 --> 00:45:08,215
Peter, I believe he's called.

472
00:45:08,432 --> 00:45:11,000
No, sir. I can tell you nothing.

473
00:45:11,769 --> 00:45:15,005
Caligula might take it into his head
to question you himself.

474
00:45:15,798 --> 00:45:16,930
He has his methods.

475
00:45:16,972 --> 00:45:18,885
I know his methods.

476
00:45:19,067 --> 00:45:21,376
And you'd die for this robe?

477
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:25,225
You're an intelligent man.
You can't believe it could cast a spell.

478
00:45:25,949 --> 00:45:28,224
Only the spell of memory.

479
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:30,787
I took it from the foot 
of the cross myself...

480
00:45:31,345 --> 00:45:34,804
...just before he died calling 
on his Father to forgive his enemies.

481
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:37,157
He did that?

482
00:45:38,586 --> 00:45:41,923
What men will do under
the inspiration of their beliefs!

483
00:45:41,965 --> 00:45:46,367
I have none myself, none at all,
though my wife is a priestess of Isis.

484
00:45:46,426 --> 00:45:50,626
I'm sure the Christians look on my faith
as debauched superstition.

485
00:45:50,764 --> 00:45:52,163
Don't you?

486
00:45:52,165 --> 00:45:54,497
The priestess of Isis
knows where her faith is.

487
00:45:54,579 --> 00:45:57,712
- We believe that love rules the world.
- So do we.

488
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,890
Well, then why are you 
such hypocrites?

489
00:46:00,896 --> 00:46:03,927
Why do you pretend to be so pure,
above all temptation?

490
00:46:03,973 --> 00:46:07,652
I think you misunderstand, my dear.
When a Christian speaks of love...

491
00:46:07,905 --> 00:46:10,294
- ...he means...
- I'm asking Demetrius.

492
00:46:10,491 --> 00:46:14,173
Jesus said,
"Love ye one another as brothers."

493
00:46:15,746 --> 00:46:17,543
Tell me...

494
00:46:17,706 --> 00:46:20,967
...how do you manage
to love a woman as a brother?

495
00:46:22,585 --> 00:46:24,158
You don't.

496
00:46:24,921 --> 00:46:27,374
It's a pity you can't tell me 
something about the robe.

497
00:46:27,378 --> 00:46:30,073
It might even mean 
your freedom.

498
00:46:30,968 --> 00:46:32,959
I can tell you nothing, sir.

499
00:46:34,221 --> 00:46:36,212
Albus.

500
00:46:37,558 --> 00:46:41,187
- Return this man to the gladiator school.
- Why, Claudius?

501
00:46:41,436 --> 00:46:43,713
You might have
further questions for him.

502
00:46:43,772 --> 00:46:47,553
We could find useful employment for him
here among our own bodyguards.

503
00:46:47,609 --> 00:46:50,282
At least until he's fit
for the arena again.

504
00:46:50,486 --> 00:46:52,463
As you say, my dear.

505
00:46:52,505 --> 00:46:55,701
Besides, when he knows us better,
he might be willing to tell us more.

506
00:46:55,741 --> 00:46:59,836
Albus, feed him,
then return to me for instructions.

507
00:46:59,878 --> 00:47:02,471
Yes, my lady. Come!

508
00:47:10,547 --> 00:47:14,050
Have you exhausted all the other sources
of your amusement?

509
00:47:14,052 --> 00:47:17,108
- But don't you find him interesting?
- He's a remarkable young man.

510
00:47:17,387 --> 00:47:21,549
He has something that Rome has lacked
since the early days of the republic.

511
00:47:21,591 --> 00:47:24,230
Something to believe in: faith.

512
00:47:24,435 --> 00:47:27,340
Our early conquests
weakened it...

513
00:47:27,365 --> 00:47:30,635
...and my family, we Caesars, 
killed and buried it.

514
00:47:31,442 --> 00:47:35,390
Strange, if the memory of a dead Jew
should bring it to life again.

515
00:47:35,432 --> 00:47:37,392
Messalina.

516
00:47:37,572 --> 00:47:39,722
Don't hurt him.

517
00:47:39,908 --> 00:47:42,463
Don't destroy what he has.

518
00:47:42,505 --> 00:47:45,797
- Are you going to interfere?
- No, my dear.

519
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:48,259
I never interfere.

520
00:47:54,797 --> 00:47:57,869
This is your post.
Don't leave it.

521
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:05,096
It's warm. Open the door.

522
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,097
Guard!

523
00:48:52,893 --> 00:48:54,884
Pick it up.

524
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,169
Do you have a woman, 
Demetrius?

525
00:49:04,362 --> 00:49:06,159
No.

526
00:49:07,281 --> 00:49:11,115
There's one thing about your religion
that still puzzles me.

527
00:49:11,369 --> 00:49:15,170
Why should one want to live out
such a dull life forever?

528
00:49:15,331 --> 00:49:18,472
To be a Christian these days
is anything but dull.

529
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:23,168
My husband tells me
you wouldn't fight because of a rule.

530
00:49:23,421 --> 00:49:26,219
A commandment,
issued by your god.

531
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:28,591
- There are ten of them.
- Tell me about them.

532
00:49:28,593 --> 00:49:29,972
They're very simple.

533
00:49:29,997 --> 00:49:33,168
Thou shalt not kill,
thou shalt not steal...

534
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:36,992
...thou shalt not bear false witness
against thy neighbour...

535
00:49:40,813 --> 00:49:43,850
...thou shalt not covet
thy neighbour's wife...

536
00:49:44,066 --> 00:49:46,057
...and so forth.

537
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:49,199
Where shall I put these?

538
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:51,353
Back on the floor.

539
00:49:55,827 --> 00:50:00,678
Tell me, are Christian wives
all so ugly that no one desires them?

540
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:03,249
I didn't say 
they weren't desired.

541
00:50:03,968 --> 00:50:05,877
I only said there's 
a commandment against it.

542
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,279
A commandment
against everything.

543
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:12,013
Don't look,
don't touch, don't fight...

544
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,648
...don't breathe, don't live.

545
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,946
Is there nothing human
in your religion?

546
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:22,212
Well, there's no commandment
that says a woman can't talk like a fool.

547
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,182
Be careful, Demetrius.

548
00:50:31,152 --> 00:50:34,144
My claws can be sharper
than the tiger's.

549
00:50:37,241 --> 00:50:41,181
My lady, the emperor
wishes to see you at once.

550
00:50:43,121 --> 00:50:45,112
Come with me.

551
00:51:24,285 --> 00:51:26,637
Do you know these objects?

552
00:51:27,288 --> 00:51:29,747
Yes. They're my uncle 
and my cousin.

553
00:51:29,789 --> 00:51:33,673
They made an attempt on my life.
What should be done with them?

554
00:51:34,503 --> 00:51:39,389
- The penalty for such a crime is death.
- You have sentenced them.

555
00:51:39,431 --> 00:51:41,738
Macro, take them out!

556
00:51:45,054 --> 00:51:49,265
Sire, I claim my right of trial
before the Senate.

557
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:51,040
You've had your trial!

558
00:51:51,048 --> 00:51:54,431
Let their heads be hung
in the Senate House as a reminder.

559
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,277
Go.

560
00:52:03,947 --> 00:52:08,800
They said that I must die because
I aspire to be a god. Because I'm mad.

561
00:52:09,118 --> 00:52:11,910
But you knew all about
their plan, didn't you?

562
00:52:11,918 --> 00:52:12,881
No, sire.

563
00:52:12,883 --> 00:52:15,674
Don't lie to me!
I've heard who put them up to it.

564
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:19,885
There isn't a man in Rome who'd dare.
But you'd dare, Messalina.

565
00:52:19,927 --> 00:52:21,302
You'd dare anything.

566
00:52:21,344 --> 00:52:22,561
- Deny it!
- Sire...

567
00:52:22,563 --> 00:52:24,441
- Deny it, I said!
- Sire, I didn't!

568
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:26,979
I'll give you witnesses
to your treachery!

569
00:52:27,004 --> 00:52:28,962
You. You'll swear
that she's guilty.

570
00:52:29,004 --> 00:52:31,602
- Yes, sire.
- And you! And you! And you!

571
00:52:32,057 --> 00:52:33,649
You hear?

572
00:52:33,808 --> 00:52:38,048
I deny nothing, sire. But what I said
was falsely reported to you.

573
00:52:38,521 --> 00:52:41,954
Do you deny saying
that I aspire to be a god?

574
00:52:41,996 --> 00:52:44,305
I said you are a god.

575
00:52:45,069 --> 00:52:48,095
Isis herself revealed it to me 
in the temple.

576
00:52:49,656 --> 00:52:51,692
Isis?

577
00:52:51,867 --> 00:52:53,842
That I'm a god?

578
00:52:53,884 --> 00:52:57,495
She said the gods themselves
look upon you as one of them.

579
00:52:57,537 --> 00:53:00,014
I spoke of this wonder
in the court...

580
00:53:00,056 --> 00:53:02,836
...but your faithful courtiers
laughed in my face.

581
00:53:02,878 --> 00:53:06,253
- The same who have accused me.
- Is this true?

582
00:53:06,506 --> 00:53:08,383
- Is it true?
- No, sire.

583
00:53:08,549 --> 00:53:11,845
Liars! Traitors!

584
00:53:11,887 --> 00:53:14,839
So, you deny 
that I am a god!

585
00:53:14,881 --> 00:53:17,480
I'll hang all your heads
in the Senate House!

586
00:53:17,505 --> 00:53:19,175
I'll have you torn to pieces!

587
00:53:19,217 --> 00:53:23,678
Kneel! Kneel! Kneel!

588
00:53:23,897 --> 00:53:26,847
Kneel to your god!

589
00:53:33,072 --> 00:53:35,762
Some wine. 
There on the table.

590
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:40,857
Now you've seen it.
Now you know.

591
00:53:40,899 --> 00:53:44,861
Do you wonder that I behave as I do?
That we're all a little mad here?

592
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:48,006
Today in Rome many innocent people
know what it is to be accused.

593
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:50,669
Innocent? 
Who said I was innocent?

594
00:53:50,714 --> 00:53:51,794
Caligula was right.

595
00:53:51,819 --> 00:53:54,492
I put those two up to it 
and they bungled it.

596
00:53:54,717 --> 00:53:59,222
Oh, if I were a man... If I were Claudius,
I'd have killed Caligula long ago.

597
00:53:59,264 --> 00:54:02,506
I'd have won the guards to my side
and taken the empire for my own.

598
00:54:02,548 --> 00:54:04,864
But he's no better
than the rest of them.

599
00:54:05,465 --> 00:54:07,180
Where was he tonight
when I needed him?

600
00:54:07,185 --> 00:54:08,962
I had only my wits to save me.

601
00:54:09,803 --> 00:54:11,794
And not for the first time.

602
00:54:18,603 --> 00:54:20,912
I don't want
another night like this.

603
00:54:23,357 --> 00:54:26,554
I have a villa by the sea.
Claudius never goes there.

604
00:54:27,695 --> 00:54:30,926
I need protection, and I want you
to come with me. Will you come?

605
00:54:33,242 --> 00:54:34,284
Why do you ask me?

606
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:36,622
You said yourself
I was your property.

607
00:54:36,828 --> 00:54:38,898
I'm not asking you 
as my property.

608
00:54:41,332 --> 00:54:44,290
I can free you. We'd be equals.

609
00:54:45,253 --> 00:54:49,087
I'm offering you life, Demetrius,
and a great deal more.

610
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:51,137
Why do you choose me?

611
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,736
Because you'd never crawl to anyone.
Because you're a man.

612
00:54:55,763 --> 00:54:58,436
Think, Demetrius. You're not blind.

613
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,596
Do I have to say it all?

614
00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:04,077
For ten years I've been married
to a man old enough to be my father.

615
00:55:04,312 --> 00:55:07,941
I've never been close to another man.
I've never wanted to.

616
00:55:08,983 --> 00:55:12,373
I need you, Demetrius.
I need your strength.

617
00:55:20,369 --> 00:55:22,439
You don't need me, Messalina.

618
00:55:22,621 --> 00:55:26,216
A woman with your wit,
your courage and your reputation.

619
00:55:27,209 --> 00:55:29,325
All Rome knows
why you married Claudius.

620
00:55:29,503 --> 00:55:32,540
If anything should ever happen to Caligula,
Claudius will become emperor.

621
00:55:32,922 --> 00:55:35,082
Since then, all of Rome
knows that a steady...

622
00:55:35,107 --> 00:55:37,463
...procession of men 
has stood guard at your door.

623
00:55:37,594 --> 00:55:39,391
Albus!

624
00:55:40,763 --> 00:55:44,153
When the truth is ugly,
only a lie can be beautiful.

625
00:55:44,934 --> 00:55:47,548
It would have been better
for both of us if you'd believed me.

626
00:55:49,021 --> 00:55:50,097
My lady.

627
00:55:50,102 --> 00:55:52,330
Return this man
to the gladiator school.

628
00:55:53,066 --> 00:55:56,085
Tell Strabo I'll send instructions
in the morning.

629
00:55:56,194 --> 00:55:58,185
Yes, my lady.

630
00:56:05,036 --> 00:56:07,027
White ball.

631
00:56:07,205 --> 00:56:10,641
- Lycidas draws a black ball.
- Last week and this week, too!

632
00:56:10,875 --> 00:56:12,866
Dardanius draws a black ball.

633
00:56:15,713 --> 00:56:17,625
He has a right to choose
like the rest of us.

634
00:56:17,629 --> 00:56:20,043
He has a right,
and I have orders.

635
00:56:21,927 --> 00:56:24,260
Demetrius 
draws a black ball.

636
00:56:28,141 --> 00:56:30,132
White ball.

637
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:41,347
- What do you want?
- This is Kaeso's pottery?

638
00:56:42,821 --> 00:56:45,619
- I've been a long time finding you.
- We don't sell at this hour.

639
00:56:45,824 --> 00:56:47,815
I didn't come to buy.

640
00:56:51,246 --> 00:56:53,919
You are friends of a Corinthian
named Demetrius?

641
00:56:54,124 --> 00:56:58,117
What do you know about Demetrius?
You've seen him, he's alive?

642
00:56:59,379 --> 00:57:01,370
Yes, he's alive.

643
00:57:02,924 --> 00:57:06,209
He told me about 
this place... and you.

644
00:57:06,251 --> 00:57:07,875
I couldn't get him
out of my mind.

645
00:57:07,886 --> 00:57:10,442
- That's why I came here.
- Where is he?

646
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:14,235
It won't do you any good to know,
but I'll see him tonight.

647
00:57:14,267 --> 00:57:18,226
- If you want to send him a message...
- Where is he? Tell me.

648
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,155
He's been sentenced to the arena.
He's in the gladiator school.

649
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,391
- Can you read?
- A little.

650
00:57:29,782 --> 00:57:31,898
What does it mean?

651
00:57:32,076 --> 00:57:35,289
It's the pairings for the combat tomorrow
in the palace enclosure.

652
00:57:35,331 --> 00:57:37,128
There, his name.

653
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:41,282
Take me to him.

654
00:57:42,669 --> 00:57:43,914
To the gladiator school?

655
00:57:44,839 --> 00:57:46,997
They'd never let a girl
like you in through the gates.

656
00:57:46,999 --> 00:57:52,035
Please. I don't know your name
or why you came here, but please help me.

657
00:57:52,345 --> 00:57:54,336
Please.

658
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:03,219
Here they come!

659
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,883
Lucia!

660
00:58:31,215 --> 00:58:33,206
Who is that girl with Demetrius?

661
00:58:34,509 --> 00:58:36,500
I've never seen her 
before, my lady.

662
00:58:36,678 --> 00:58:38,873
She hasn't quite the look 
of the rest of them.

663
00:58:39,346 --> 00:58:40,695
No, she hasn't.

664
00:58:40,932 --> 00:58:42,739
Sometimes a man's
sweetheart finds out...

665
00:58:42,764 --> 00:58:44,710
...he's here and sneaks
in with the others.

666
00:58:50,232 --> 00:58:54,623
Please don't be angry.
I took another's place. I had to come.

667
00:58:54,903 --> 00:58:56,734
You're not angry?

668
00:58:56,905 --> 00:58:58,623
Of course not.

669
00:58:58,699 --> 00:59:00,590
We tried to find out 
what had happened to you.

670
00:59:00,631 --> 00:59:03,004
No one would tell us.

671
00:59:03,245 --> 00:59:05,236
I prayed that...

672
00:59:06,331 --> 00:59:08,322
Oh, Demetrius.

673
00:59:12,754 --> 00:59:15,029
I'm very grateful, Lucia...

674
00:59:15,214 --> 00:59:16,966
...but you can't stay here.

675
00:59:17,133 --> 00:59:19,849
- You must go.
- No, Demetrius, I won't go.

676
00:59:19,852 --> 00:59:21,843
I have a right to be here.

677
00:59:23,806 --> 00:59:26,837
Tomorrow they'll... 
they'll kill you?

678
00:59:28,143 --> 00:59:29,940
Yes.

679
00:59:32,981 --> 00:59:35,779
I've loved you
since you first came to us.

680
00:59:36,985 --> 00:59:39,499
You never knew.

681
00:59:39,695 --> 00:59:41,890
And I'd never have told you.

682
00:59:43,282 --> 00:59:46,479
No, Demetrius,
I won't let you send me away.

683
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:50,214
These last few hours 
belong to me.

684
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:06,543
I've changed my mind, Strabo.
The Christian's not to fight tomorrow.

685
01:00:06,804 --> 01:00:08,396
I'm glad, my lady.

686
01:00:08,556 --> 01:00:12,549
Then he isn't entitled to entertainment.
Send him out.

687
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:15,119
- But, my lady...
- You know the rules.

688
01:00:16,772 --> 01:00:18,793
Yes, my lady.

689
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:52,461
Demetrius!

690
01:00:56,976 --> 01:00:59,365
- Demetrius!
- Stop!

691
01:00:59,562 --> 01:01:01,359
Demetrius!

692
01:01:04,775 --> 01:01:07,573
Get back. Get back, all of you.
Back to your quarters.

693
01:01:15,452 --> 01:01:17,886
- You're wasted on that Christian.
- No.

694
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,149
- Forget him.
- No. No!

695
01:01:28,673 --> 01:01:31,556
Demetrius! No!

696
01:01:35,005 --> 01:01:36,926
Demetrius!

697
01:01:47,315 --> 01:01:49,704
Demetrius! Demetrius!

698
01:01:52,111 --> 01:01:55,782
God, help her!
God, help her!

699
01:01:56,032 --> 01:01:58,830
If you are a God, help her!

700
01:02:02,162 --> 01:02:04,153
Demetrius!

701
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,071
Get away!

702
01:02:54,086 --> 01:02:56,077
Move!

703
01:03:19,401 --> 01:03:20,993
She's dead!

704
01:04:02,817 --> 01:04:05,047
- Give me a sword.
- You're not fighting today.

705
01:04:05,236 --> 01:04:07,306
I said give me the sword!

706
01:04:07,488 --> 01:04:09,524
Let him have it, Strabo.

707
01:04:09,699 --> 01:04:11,639
If you want to give 
the emperor some sport,

708
01:04:11,965 --> 01:04:15,161
send these others out
to him one by one.

709
01:04:17,831 --> 01:04:19,822
Why, it's the Christian.

710
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,753
- Again?
- He wasn't to fight.

711
01:06:14,607 --> 01:06:17,326
I didn't draw him, Strabo!
You can't send me out there!

712
01:06:17,527 --> 01:06:19,916
- You know the rules!
- We've changed the rules!

713
01:06:20,112 --> 01:06:22,262
- We go now, together.
- Come on.

714
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,310
Not Glycon! Go back!

715
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:04,021
Sire, I speak for the guards.

716
01:08:04,377 --> 01:08:07,130
The Prefect
Cassius Chaerea may speak.

717
01:08:07,547 --> 01:08:11,426
Never at any games in history have Romans
seen what we have seen here today.

718
01:08:11,842 --> 01:08:14,640
We say that this man
has earned his freedom for life.

719
01:08:20,058 --> 01:08:24,574
And we'd like to have a sword like his
in the Praetorian Guard.

720
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:30,145
You forget that these Christians owe
allegiance to another king, another god.

721
01:08:31,444 --> 01:08:32,512
Silence!

722
01:08:32,537 --> 01:08:35,240
Sire, the guards want a hero.
Listen to them.

723
01:08:35,489 --> 01:08:38,367
Ask him, sire.
Put him to the question.

724
01:08:41,412 --> 01:08:43,243
Christian...

725
01:08:43,413 --> 01:08:48,203
...do you renounce your false god,
this king of an invisible kingdom...

726
01:08:48,502 --> 01:08:51,858
...who expects to come back
some day and rule the earth?

727
01:08:53,256 --> 01:08:55,285
There is no other king
but Caesar.

728
01:08:57,010 --> 01:09:02,289
There is no power greater than his,
in this world or any other.

729
01:09:02,723 --> 01:09:05,999
By the mercy of Caesar,
you are a free man.

730
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:10,216
Prefect, 
you may induct him...

731
01:09:10,241 --> 01:09:13,406
...into the guards
with the rank of tribune.

732
01:09:13,692 --> 01:09:16,411
Tonight let him sacrifice
in the temple.

733
01:10:31,431 --> 01:10:33,149
Isis...

734
01:10:33,308 --> 01:10:36,903
...Queen of the Mysteries,
Mother of Egypt...

735
01:10:37,145 --> 01:10:39,261
...Protectress of Rome...

736
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:42,511
...your servant Demetrius
offers you sacrifice.

737
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:52,585
Well, are you waiting
for your goddess to strike me dead?

738
01:10:55,037 --> 01:10:57,505
What have you and I
to do with gods?

739
01:10:57,706 --> 01:11:01,858
I rejected mine because what he taught
was against all reason and reality.

740
01:11:02,127 --> 01:11:05,403
Do you think I'll accept
this obscenity in his place?

741
01:11:09,968 --> 01:11:11,959
We need no gods, you and I.

742
01:11:13,346 --> 01:11:15,576
We have each other...

743
01:11:15,765 --> 01:11:17,756
...for as long as we live.

744
01:11:18,684 --> 01:11:20,754
There is no past.

745
01:11:20,936 --> 01:11:22,654
No future.

746
01:11:22,813 --> 01:11:24,804
Only now.

747
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:46,862
Do you see her, Claudius?

748
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:51,098
The goddess Diana?

749
01:11:52,049 --> 01:11:54,517
Every night she comes to me...

750
01:11:54,718 --> 01:11:56,788
...to my arms.

751
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:58,767
There.

752
01:11:59,931 --> 01:12:01,808
There she goes.

753
01:12:01,975 --> 01:12:05,092
- Now do you see her?
- No, sire.

754
01:12:05,311 --> 01:12:07,302
Why not?

755
01:12:10,107 --> 01:12:13,099
Only you gods
are privileged to see each other.

756
01:12:15,237 --> 01:12:18,035
Of course.
What are you doing here?

757
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,231
You sent for me, sire.

758
01:12:20,409 --> 01:12:22,206
Oh, yes.

759
01:12:22,369 --> 01:12:25,167
I thought you might 
be lonely, Uncle.

760
01:12:26,831 --> 01:12:28,423
Caesar is considerate.

761
01:12:28,583 --> 01:12:31,893
We haven't seen Messalina
for nearly three months.

762
01:12:32,837 --> 01:12:36,034
- She has been busy at the temple.
- How pious.

763
01:12:36,841 --> 01:12:40,311
- Which temple, Uncle?
- The temple of Isis, sire.

764
01:12:40,552 --> 01:12:42,349
Oh, no, Uncle.

765
01:12:42,513 --> 01:12:46,791
No. Messalina worships this summer
at the temple of Venus.

766
01:12:47,059 --> 01:12:50,938
Even now at the seashore
Venus is rising from the waves...

767
01:12:51,187 --> 01:12:54,145
...and Messalina's there
to welcome her.

768
01:12:54,357 --> 01:12:56,951
Deny that she is there, Uncle...

769
01:12:57,151 --> 01:13:00,587
...and that our newest tribune
is her constant visitor.

770
01:13:02,281 --> 01:13:04,476
Shall I take steps?

771
01:13:05,659 --> 01:13:09,777
After all, I'm responsible
for the morals of the court.

772
01:13:10,789 --> 01:13:13,383
Messalina is my wife, sire.

773
01:13:13,583 --> 01:13:18,020
Any steps that are to be taken,
I prefer to take myself.

774
01:13:18,922 --> 01:13:20,958
My poor uncle...

775
01:13:21,132 --> 01:13:25,284
...the tribune's so young,
so strong, so handsome...

776
01:13:25,553 --> 01:13:27,748
...and so brave.

777
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:29,921
A hero of Rome.

778
01:13:30,641 --> 01:13:32,632
I made him one myself.

779
01:13:34,812 --> 01:13:37,000
Did you know that 
when he goes out for the palace,

780
01:13:37,008 --> 01:13:39,914
the guards cheer him
louder than they do me?

781
01:13:40,692 --> 01:13:42,683
Did you know that, Uncle?

782
01:14:30,405 --> 01:14:33,397
The first cup for thirst...

783
01:14:35,243 --> 01:14:37,916
...the second for joy...

784
01:14:38,121 --> 01:14:40,237
...the third for delight...

785
01:14:40,415 --> 01:14:42,531
...and the fourth for folly.

786
01:15:56,236 --> 01:15:58,033
Glycon.

787
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:04,278
- Who is that?
- A man to see the tribune, my lady.

788
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:08,459
I'll see him.
Leave me alone with him.

789
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:19,049
- You're the fisherman.
- And you're Claudius's wife.

790
01:16:19,299 --> 01:16:22,132
- What do you want?
- My business is with Demetrius.

791
01:16:22,343 --> 01:16:24,413
- This is my house.
- I know.

792
01:16:24,595 --> 01:16:26,829
I was told, if I wanted to see him,
I have to come here.

793
01:16:26,973 --> 01:16:30,568
You're wasting your time.
He doesn't want to see you.

794
01:16:30,810 --> 01:16:33,085
I'm sure he can say that 
for himself.

795
01:16:37,107 --> 01:16:38,938
You can leave now.

796
01:16:39,109 --> 01:16:40,861
Why are you afraid?

797
01:16:41,028 --> 01:16:43,019
I, afraid?

798
01:16:43,697 --> 01:16:46,052
You'll never get him back.

799
01:16:46,241 --> 01:16:48,318
What can you offer him?
The company of slaves...

800
01:16:48,324 --> 01:16:50,780
...and beggars,
the refuse of Rome?

801
01:16:51,162 --> 01:16:55,474
Poverty and self-denial?
Prayers, tears, death?

802
01:16:56,167 --> 01:16:58,296
You see, I've studied
your teachings.

803
01:16:58,338 --> 01:17:00,981
And I, Fisherman,
I can give him the world.

804
01:17:01,172 --> 01:17:03,653
If he has to choose between us, 
do you think he'd hesitate...

805
01:17:03,658 --> 01:17:06,034
...for one minute?
Of course not.

806
01:17:06,301 --> 01:17:09,179
And that's why you hate me.
I can see it in your eyes.

807
01:17:09,638 --> 01:17:11,788
What you see in my eyes is pity.

808
01:17:14,434 --> 01:17:16,629
- Get out!
- Messalina!

809
01:17:23,484 --> 01:17:25,873
- So they sent for you.
- No, Demetrius.

810
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:28,300
My work in the north
was finished.

811
01:17:28,489 --> 01:17:30,634
Well, if you found
enough fools to satisfy you...

812
01:17:30,659 --> 01:17:32,330
...I can't be
important to you.

813
01:17:32,372 --> 01:17:33,702
Jesus himself 
thought no man...

814
01:17:33,727 --> 01:17:36,173
...was unimportant,
and no woman.

815
01:17:36,204 --> 01:17:37,434
He was wrong.

816
01:17:37,476 --> 01:17:39,743
As he was wrong
in so many things.

817
01:17:41,251 --> 01:17:43,401
You are no longer
important to me, Peter.

818
01:17:43,586 --> 01:17:44,750
I have nothing against you...

819
01:17:44,792 --> 01:17:47,046
...but what you have to say
doesn't interest me.

820
01:17:47,256 --> 01:17:49,451
So far I haven't said anything.

821
01:17:49,634 --> 01:17:51,625
Then why did you come here?

822
01:17:51,802 --> 01:17:54,839
Do I have to give a reason
for wanting to see an old friend?

823
01:17:55,514 --> 01:17:57,505
He's right, Messalina.

824
01:17:58,267 --> 01:18:00,927
We can't refuse our hospitality
to an old friend, can we?

825
01:18:00,936 --> 01:18:03,634
- Send him away.
- No. Not until he's had some wine with us.

826
01:18:03,730 --> 01:18:07,882
- Glycon, bring wine.
- Thank you. I've already had some.

827
01:18:08,151 --> 01:18:11,109
Ah, you shouldn't
have done that, Messalina.

828
01:18:11,321 --> 01:18:13,357
He's my friend.

829
01:18:13,531 --> 01:18:16,316
We travelled here together
from Galilee, persuading people...

830
01:18:16,341 --> 01:18:19,232
...to give up their lives
for a beautiful dream.

831
01:18:25,083 --> 01:18:27,517
Take it, Peter. It's real.

832
01:18:27,711 --> 01:18:29,986
Hot, spiced with cinnamon
and cloves.

833
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:32,163
It wasn't made out of water.

834
01:18:33,133 --> 01:18:36,091
Did you know that Jesus
could turn water into wine?

835
01:18:36,302 --> 01:18:38,770
- That was only one of his tricks.
- Yes, only one.

836
01:18:38,971 --> 01:18:41,041
Anything that was base,
he could make noble.

837
01:18:41,224 --> 01:18:44,930
He found a leper and he made him clean.
He found death and he made life.

838
01:18:44,935 --> 01:18:46,608
He found you a slave
and he made you free.

839
01:18:46,633 --> 01:18:47,353
Get out!

840
01:18:47,354 --> 01:18:50,019
So now you've won a great victory
over him, haven't you, Tribune?

841
01:18:50,044 --> 01:18:51,966
You've made yourself
a slave again.

842
01:18:52,943 --> 01:18:55,883
- Let him go, Demetrius.
- Peter!

843
01:18:56,696 --> 01:18:58,755
That's right, 
I'm through with it. All of it.

844
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:00,076
Don't ever try to come back.

845
01:19:00,283 --> 01:19:03,434
- I have no intention of coming back.
- I know you better than that.

846
01:19:03,661 --> 01:19:04,896
You never give up.

847
01:19:04,938 --> 01:19:06,932
You didn't let go of Marcellus 
until he was dead.

848
01:19:06,956 --> 01:19:07,964
You brought him to me.

849
01:19:07,969 --> 01:19:10,732
Yes, and in doing so
condemned him to his death!

850
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:15,889
But your tricks won't work on me,
because I know them.

851
01:19:16,131 --> 01:19:18,520
Tell that to Jesus
the next time you see him.

852
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:21,185
Has he made any of his
miraculous appearances lately?

853
01:19:21,386 --> 01:19:25,299
Walking through the Forum, perhaps,
or strolling on the surface of the Tiber?

854
01:19:25,557 --> 01:19:28,087
Tell him what I said. 
Tell him, Peter!

855
01:19:28,685 --> 01:19:31,483
He'll know 
without my telling him.

856
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:48,651
You talked to Peter, didn't you?

857
01:19:50,997 --> 01:19:53,067
What did you tell him about me?

858
01:19:53,249 --> 01:19:55,968
I don't discuss your affairs
with anyone, sir.

859
01:19:56,169 --> 01:19:58,239
You freed me and I am grateful.

860
01:19:58,421 --> 01:20:00,696
You must have told him something.

861
01:20:00,882 --> 01:20:06,240
I asked him if one who'd killed
30 men in the arena, as I have...

862
01:20:06,554 --> 01:20:08,509
...could ever hope 
to sleep at night.

863
01:20:08,847 --> 01:20:12,203
Why did you ask him that?
Why should he know the answer?

864
01:20:13,602 --> 01:20:15,593
Take your hand away.

865
01:20:17,397 --> 01:20:21,948
You're under my orders, Glycon.
I forbid you to ever see this man again.

866
01:20:22,235 --> 01:20:24,510
I won't obey that order, Tribune.

867
01:20:24,696 --> 01:20:28,166
You are my superior,
but I choose my friends.

868
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:35,501
We were friends once, Glycon.

869
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:38,375
I know.

870
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:42,057
I suppose I should blame myself
for what has become of you.

871
01:20:42,295 --> 01:20:44,190
When I put that sword
in your hand it killed...

872
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:46,358
...more than Dardanius
and the others.

873
01:20:46,591 --> 01:20:48,741
It killed you.

874
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:51,316
I hope you sleep well, sir.

875
01:20:52,513 --> 01:20:54,504
Good night.

876
01:21:10,447 --> 01:21:12,324
Demetrius?

877
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:14,606
Demetrius.

878
01:21:14,784 --> 01:21:16,581
Demetrius!

879
01:21:30,215 --> 01:21:34,254
So, the mob can jeer me
in the Forum...

880
01:21:34,511 --> 01:21:36,502
...tear down my statues.

881
01:21:39,724 --> 01:21:42,796
Where were the guards
when these sacrileges were committed?

882
01:21:43,019 --> 01:21:45,319
Sire, my men were 
under arms all night...

883
01:21:45,344 --> 01:21:47,695
...but we haven't enough
to patrol the entire city.

884
01:21:47,815 --> 01:21:51,125
Are you insinuating
that the entire city is against me?

885
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:53,816
Sire, there's a shortage of grain.
It's only natural...

886
01:21:53,818 --> 01:21:56,273
And I must take 
the blame for that, too?

887
01:21:56,615 --> 01:22:00,449
There's a shortage because
I've emptied my treasury for the guards.

888
01:22:00,702 --> 01:22:03,694
They take my gold
and give me nothing in return.

889
01:22:05,498 --> 01:22:07,641
These are my orders:

890
01:22:07,792 --> 01:22:10,511
one more desecration 
of this sort...

891
01:22:10,712 --> 01:22:13,863
...one more unpunished
insult to your emperor...

892
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:18,368
...and every tenth man in the guards
is to be crucified at the city gates!

893
01:22:18,636 --> 01:22:20,866
Post that at the guards'
headquarters!

894
01:22:21,055 --> 01:22:26,059
Sire, not the guards.
Your power depends on their goodwill.

895
01:22:26,061 --> 01:22:28,803
- Don't publish such an order.
- I'm the emperor!

896
01:22:29,062 --> 01:22:32,213
I can do what I please
with whom I please!

897
01:22:33,233 --> 01:22:35,827
The lady Messalina, sire.

898
01:22:36,027 --> 01:22:38,018
Show her in.

899
01:22:40,448 --> 01:22:45,238
You didn't tell me she was back in Rome,
or didn't you know it?

900
01:22:51,124 --> 01:22:53,718
Stop there. Search her!

901
01:22:58,173 --> 01:23:01,370
It pleases you
to question my loyalty, sire.

902
01:23:01,593 --> 01:23:04,153
I've come to give you
new proof of it.

903
01:23:04,345 --> 01:23:06,687
Must have been an
irresistible impulse to bring you...

904
01:23:06,712 --> 01:23:08,873
...from the seashore 
at this hour.

905
01:23:08,891 --> 01:23:11,564
- I think you'll agree that it's important.
- Speak up!

906
01:23:11,769 --> 01:23:14,647
I have no secrets
from your husband.

907
01:23:14,855 --> 01:23:18,376
My news concerns the robe.
The magic robe.

908
01:23:18,378 --> 01:23:21,315
Yes, yes, I remember.
Have you got it?

909
01:23:21,570 --> 01:23:23,162
I know how to get it.

910
01:23:23,321 --> 01:23:26,176
The man who owns it,
the one who calls himself the fisherman...

911
01:23:26,178 --> 01:23:28,334
...is back in Rome.

912
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:30,718
Sometimes, Uncle, 
I think I made a mistake...

913
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,524
...not to marry her myself.

914
01:23:32,789 --> 01:23:35,349
The workings of her mind
appeal to me.

915
01:23:35,541 --> 01:23:37,997
She leaves her warm bed 
in the cold dawn...

916
01:23:38,002 --> 01:23:40,943
...to rush here
full of zeal and loyalty.

917
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:43,461
Why, Messalina?

918
01:23:43,632 --> 01:23:46,988
The robe, sire,
holds the secret of eternal life.

919
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:49,542
Seize this fisherman.
He's dangerous to you.

920
01:23:49,698 --> 01:23:51,110
A threat to your power.

921
01:23:51,152 --> 01:23:53,126
Dangerous to me...

922
01:23:53,308 --> 01:23:55,299
...or to you?

923
01:23:55,476 --> 01:23:59,048
Has this fisherman been making
trouble for you with your lover?

924
01:23:59,605 --> 01:24:03,234
Of course. You're not interested
in the robe for me.

925
01:24:03,484 --> 01:24:05,714
You want to get rid
of the fisherman.

926
01:24:07,112 --> 01:24:10,229
And you!
Why didn't you bring me this news?

927
01:24:10,449 --> 01:24:12,667
This fisherman comes and goes
as he pleases...

928
01:24:12,671 --> 01:24:15,226
...making fools
of the whole Praetorian Guard!

929
01:24:15,537 --> 01:24:18,927
I want the robe!
And I want it today!

930
01:24:19,165 --> 01:24:20,541
I'll do my best, sire...

931
01:24:20,583 --> 01:24:22,625
...but the Christians 
will protect their leader.

932
01:24:22,835 --> 01:24:25,294
They'll hide him and they'll hide
the robe of their king.

933
01:24:25,357 --> 01:24:27,050
It may take more than one day.

934
01:24:27,092 --> 01:24:29,437
I didn't ask you for excuses!

935
01:24:31,928 --> 01:24:35,083
Get me the robe!
Take hostages! Kill them!

936
01:24:35,305 --> 01:24:37,936
Torture them by the hundred
till they agree to give it up!

937
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:40,161
You'll find one that will talk.

938
01:24:40,477 --> 01:24:42,035
Wait.

939
01:24:42,037 --> 01:24:43,683
There's one of your
own tribunes who has...

940
01:24:43,710 --> 01:24:45,880
...special qualifications
for this duty.

941
01:24:46,149 --> 01:24:49,221
Who knows their leaders,
their hiding places.

942
01:24:49,444 --> 01:24:53,676
We'll give Demetrius an opportunity
to earn the cheers he receives.

943
01:24:54,574 --> 01:24:56,565
These are my orders. Go!

944
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:12,496
Guards, forward march!

945
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:19,670
Guards, halt!

946
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:24,591
What do you want here?

947
01:25:25,436 --> 01:25:26,932
Don't you know me, Kaeso?

948
01:25:26,974 --> 01:25:29,692
The footsteps I heard
were those of a stranger.

949
01:25:31,150 --> 01:25:33,760
- I want the robe. Where is it?
- I haven't seen it.

950
01:25:33,777 --> 01:25:36,052
Perhaps I can help you,
Demetrius.

951
01:25:40,825 --> 01:25:43,667
- What do you want with the robe?
- I want to take it to the emperor.

952
01:25:43,709 --> 01:25:45,417
- Why?
- I am giving you a chance.

953
01:25:45,523 --> 01:25:48,242
Unless he gets his hands on it,
he'll wipe you out.

954
01:25:48,499 --> 01:25:51,138
You mean we can buy our lives
with our master's robe?

955
01:25:51,752 --> 01:25:53,743
It's only a piece of cloth.

956
01:25:53,921 --> 01:25:56,913
And you'd let
a thousand people die for it?

957
01:25:57,132 --> 01:26:00,442
That's what you want, isn't it?
You and your god...

958
01:26:00,677 --> 01:26:02,747
...who let his own son
die on a cross.

959
01:26:03,054 --> 01:26:07,172
Who let Stephen and James die,
Marcellus and Diana, and a hundred others.

960
01:26:07,434 --> 01:26:10,090
The same god who turned
his face from me when I begged him...

961
01:26:10,093 --> 01:26:11,651
...to save
an innocent girl's life.

962
01:26:12,605 --> 01:26:15,836
- You blame God for that?
- Who else can I blame?

963
01:26:16,067 --> 01:26:19,901
- Then you still believe there is a god.
- I believe in nothing.

964
01:26:20,154 --> 01:26:22,145
Where's the robe?

965
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:25,731
You'll find it in there.

966
01:26:47,054 --> 01:26:49,045
She's not dead.

967
01:26:49,223 --> 01:26:50,815
No.

968
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:56,761
Lucia.

969
01:27:04,487 --> 01:27:06,584
Ever since the night
she was so cruelly hurt...

970
01:27:06,586 --> 01:27:08,589
...she's been as you see her...

971
01:27:08,866 --> 01:27:12,552
...in some darkness where
her injured mind has crawled for refuge.

972
01:27:22,546 --> 01:27:26,778
It's very strange.
No one's been able to take it from her.

973
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:30,929
It's as if, even in her darkness,
she finds some comfort in it.

974
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:35,084
- Get it from her.
- How?

975
01:27:35,266 --> 01:27:39,259
How should I know?
One of your miracles. Wake her up.

976
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,956
Would it be kindness to bring her
back to remembrance and shame?

977
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:46,341
To learn that her sacrifice
was for nothing?

978
01:27:46,568 --> 01:27:50,686
That the man she worshipped
now reviles and ridicules his god?

979
01:27:55,201 --> 01:27:57,237
You could do much for her.

980
01:27:57,412 --> 01:27:59,403
Only you.

981
01:27:59,997 --> 01:28:03,427
When she comes into the light again 
she'll need infinite kindness...

982
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:05,548
...infinite love.

983
01:28:08,505 --> 01:28:11,338
If you want the robe,
pray for it.

984
01:28:12,843 --> 01:28:14,834
Once you knew how.

985
01:28:28,733 --> 01:28:30,724
Lucia.

986
01:28:33,571 --> 01:28:35,562
Lucia.

987
01:28:39,826 --> 01:28:41,817
Oh, God.

988
01:29:15,818 --> 01:29:19,891
Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do.

989
01:29:54,772 --> 01:29:56,763
Father, forgive me.

990
01:29:57,691 --> 01:29:59,682
Forgive me, Father.

991
01:30:19,211 --> 01:30:21,247
Demetrius, what...

992
01:30:21,422 --> 01:30:23,731
Why are you dressed like that?

993
01:30:23,924 --> 01:30:25,915
Like our enemies?

994
01:30:26,885 --> 01:30:29,604
I've been no one's enemy
but my own.

995
01:30:29,804 --> 01:30:32,443
Like you, 
I've been in darkness.

996
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:36,000
I... I had a terrible dream, 
Demetrius.

997
01:30:36,042 --> 01:30:38,688
- I can't remember...
- Don't try.

998
01:30:39,397 --> 01:30:41,592
Let me have the robe, Lucia.

999
01:30:45,194 --> 01:30:48,266
You must take it to the emperor,
if it will save lives.

1000
01:30:48,489 --> 01:30:50,764
No, Demetrius.

1001
01:30:50,949 --> 01:30:54,100
Peter's right.
There's no danger.

1002
01:30:55,704 --> 01:30:57,501
You'll come back.

1003
01:31:00,041 --> 01:31:02,077
You came back to me.

1004
01:31:20,477 --> 01:31:21,897
I said there was no danger...

1005
01:31:21,922 --> 01:31:24,130
...but there is for you.
Do you understand?

1006
01:31:24,356 --> 01:31:27,268
Make your way to the palace.
You know the Augustan steps?

1007
01:31:27,484 --> 01:31:30,760
Wait for me there.
I'll come out to you as soon as I can.

1008
01:31:39,453 --> 01:31:41,984
They're not cheering. 
Do you notice it, Claudius?

1009
01:31:42,026 --> 01:31:46,697
Yes, sire. Your threat against them
was posted on the gate as they came in.

1010
01:31:46,739 --> 01:31:48,579
And they dare take offence?

1011
01:31:48,753 --> 01:31:51,028
I've pampered them long enough.

1012
01:31:51,214 --> 01:31:53,808
- Well?
- The tribune has returned, sire.

1013
01:32:08,355 --> 01:32:10,346
That's it?

1014
01:32:11,858 --> 01:32:13,530
That's the robe?

1015
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:15,685
Give it to me.

1016
01:32:23,786 --> 01:32:25,777
Wait here.

1017
01:32:54,774 --> 01:32:56,765
Get out!

1018
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:08,901
Kill him!

1019
01:33:11,873 --> 01:33:13,067
No!

1020
01:33:24,051 --> 01:33:26,042
Rise.

1021
01:33:27,971 --> 01:33:29,962
Rise!

1022
01:33:33,352 --> 01:33:37,630
By the power of this robe,
I command you to rise!

1023
01:33:43,736 --> 01:33:46,637
It's a fraud. 
You've cheated me!

1024
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:49,138
This is what you asked for, sire.

1025
01:33:49,638 --> 01:33:52,090
The robe that Jesus of Nazareth 
wore to the cross.

1026
01:33:52,132 --> 01:33:55,554
You lied. 
It has no magic powers!

1027
01:33:56,874 --> 01:34:00,708
- No one ever said it had.
- It's a fraud, and so was Jesus.

1028
01:34:00,961 --> 01:34:03,591
I tried it.
I had a prisoner killed.

1029
01:34:03,755 --> 01:34:05,746
I ordered him to rise.

1030
01:34:05,924 --> 01:34:08,722
- He's still dead!
- You did that?

1031
01:34:10,053 --> 01:34:13,045
You killed a man
to test our master's robe?

1032
01:34:13,681 --> 01:34:15,672
Stop him! You! Seize him!

1033
01:34:17,643 --> 01:34:20,999
Threaten your emperor, will you?
Christian!

1034
01:34:21,230 --> 01:34:24,104
Macro, get the Armour
and the weapons!

1035
01:34:25,859 --> 01:34:27,850
You shall kill him out there.

1036
01:34:28,612 --> 01:34:32,127
I took you out of the arena.
Now you'll go back to it...

1037
01:34:32,490 --> 01:34:35,332
...and die as
you should have died long ago.

1038
01:34:36,119 --> 01:34:38,314
May God forgive you
for what you've done.

1039
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:10,674
My loyal guards...

1040
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:13,966
...by your sullen attitude here today, 
you have questioned steps...

1041
01:35:13,991 --> 01:35:16,516
...that I have found it 
necessary to take...

1042
01:35:16,824 --> 01:35:19,882
...in order to preserve
the imperial dignity.

1043
01:35:20,243 --> 01:35:24,282
Now I will show you proof
that my actions were justified.

1044
01:35:24,539 --> 01:35:26,416
That treason is everywhere.

1045
01:35:26,583 --> 01:35:28,854
That it has even shown 
its face among those...

1046
01:35:28,879 --> 01:35:31,203
...who are sworn
to protect my person.

1047
01:35:31,462 --> 01:35:33,453
In your own ranks.

1048
01:35:33,798 --> 01:35:37,757
Let what you'll see now
be a lesson to all among you...

1049
01:35:38,010 --> 01:35:40,604
...who fail in loyalty
to your emperor.

1050
01:35:40,804 --> 01:35:44,026
The instrument of my justice 
will be the greatest...

1051
01:35:44,029 --> 01:35:46,917
...gladiator who
ever fought in the arena.

1052
01:35:47,227 --> 01:35:49,058
Macro.

1053
01:36:00,990 --> 01:36:02,787
- Put them back.
- What have you done?

1054
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:05,333
- I want no shield.
- Demetrius, it's not too late.

1055
01:36:05,375 --> 01:36:07,986
- I'll go to Caligula.
- Come on!

1056
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:10,969
Don't let him kill you.
Fight him.

1057
01:36:11,166 --> 01:36:12,599
We'll go away from here.

1058
01:36:12,751 --> 01:36:16,630
It doesn't matter that you're a Christian.
I'll be a Christian too, if you say so.

1059
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:19,030
Don't let him kill you, 
Demetrius!

1060
01:36:48,868 --> 01:36:51,302
Watch, my loyal guards.

1061
01:36:51,496 --> 01:36:53,566
Watch him die.

1062
01:36:53,748 --> 01:36:57,457
- Life! Life!
- Let him live! Let him live!

1063
01:37:04,258 --> 01:37:06,818
- Let a traitor live?
- Sire...

1064
01:37:07,219 --> 01:37:09,972
...the guards demand mercy.
They demand life.

1065
01:37:10,305 --> 01:37:11,704
Demand!

1066
01:37:11,848 --> 01:37:14,567
No one makes demands of God!

1067
01:37:18,646 --> 01:37:20,443
Claudius, stand clear!

1068
01:37:20,982 --> 01:37:22,973
No! No!

1069
01:37:38,373 --> 01:37:39,692
Hail Claudius!

1070
01:37:39,833 --> 01:37:55,420
Hail Claudius! Hail Claudius!

1071
01:37:56,682 --> 01:38:01,756
You have made me emperor
and I will try to serve Rome well.

1072
01:38:03,146 --> 01:38:06,183
I want it clearly understood
that I am not a god...

1073
01:38:06,399 --> 01:38:09,232
...nor am I likely to become one.

1074
01:38:10,862 --> 01:38:14,793
Nor am I quite the fool that
I have pretended to be all these years...

1075
01:38:14,907 --> 01:38:19,219
...in order to preserve my life.
That is ended.

1076
01:38:19,995 --> 01:38:23,829
You have made me Caesar,
and I will act the part.

1077
01:38:24,082 --> 01:38:26,073
- Hail Claudius!
- Hail Claudius!

1078
01:38:35,843 --> 01:38:37,834
Messalina.

1079
01:39:01,159 --> 01:39:05,710
It's no secret from any of you
that I've mocked my marriage vows.

1080
01:39:05,997 --> 01:39:09,466
That I've openly disgraced
my husband and myself.

1081
01:39:10,292 --> 01:39:12,283
That, too, is ended.

1082
01:39:14,213 --> 01:39:17,922
I am Caesar's wife,
and I will act the part.

1083
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:21,126
- Hail Caesar!
- Hail Caesar!

1084
01:39:24,764 --> 01:39:27,597
- Sire.
- Tribune.

1085
01:39:28,810 --> 01:39:32,120
Sire, I've deeply wronged you.

1086
01:39:32,522 --> 01:39:35,719
You wronged yourself.
You merely disappointed me.

1087
01:39:37,067 --> 01:39:40,104
I give you your last commission
as Tribune of the Guards.

1088
01:39:40,696 --> 01:39:42,288
Go to your Christian leaders...

1089
01:39:42,448 --> 01:39:46,844
and tell them that as long as they commit
no acts of disloyalty to the state...

1090
01:39:47,077 --> 01:39:49,511
...they will have nothing
