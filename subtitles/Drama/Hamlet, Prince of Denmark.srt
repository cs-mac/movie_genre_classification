1
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,600
- (DISTANT) Who's there?
- Nay, answer me.

2
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,400
- Stand and unfold yourself.
- Long live the king!

3
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,400
Bernardo?

4
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,000
- He.
- You come most carefully upon your hour.

5
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,400
'Tis now struck twelve.
Get thee to bed, Francisco.

6
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,400
For this relief much thanks.
'Tis bitter cold, and I am sick at heart.

7
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,600
- Have you had quiet guard?
- Not a mouse stirring.

8
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Well, good night.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,400
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
the rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

10
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,800
I think I hear them. Stand, ho!

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,600
- Who's there?
- (MAN) Friends to this ground.

12
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,000
- (2ND MAN) Liegemen to the Dane.
- Good night.

13
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,400
- Farewell. Who hath relieved you?
- Bernardo has my place.

14
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,200
Give you good night.

15
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,000
Holla! Bernardo!

16
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,000
Say, what, is Horatio there?

17
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,400
A piece of him.

18
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,400
Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.

19
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,200
- Has this thing appear'd again tonight?
- I have seen nothing.

20
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,600
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
and will not let belief take hold of him

21
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,800
touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,600
I have entreated him
to watch the minutes of this night,

23
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,800
that if again this apparition come,
he may approve our eyes and speak to it.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,600
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

25
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,200
Sit down awhile,
and let us once again assail your ears,

26
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,400
that are so fortified against our story,
what we have two nights seen.

27
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, sit we down,
and let us hear Bernardo speak of this.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,400
Last night of all, when yond same star
that's westward from the pole

29
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,200
had made his course to where now it burns,

30
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,800
Marcellus and myself, the bell beating one...

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,600
Peace! Look where it comes again!

32
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,400
In the same figure like the king that's dead.

33
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,200
Thou art a scholar, speak to it, Horatio.

34
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,600
Looks it not like the king? Mark it, Horatio.

35
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,400
Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.

36
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,200
- It would be spoke to.
- Question it, Horatio.

37
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,000
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,

38
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,600
together with that fair and warlike form

39
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,600
in which the majesty of buried Denmark
did sometimes march?

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,800
By heaven, I charge thee speak!

41
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,600
- It is offended.
- See, it stalks away.

42
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Stay! Speak, speak!

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I charge thee speak!

44
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,200
'Tis gone and will not answer.

45
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
How now, Horatio.

46
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,200
You tremble and look pale.
Is not this more than fantasy?

47
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,200
Before my God, I might not this believe
without the avouch of mine own eyes.

48
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,200
- Is it not like the king?
- As thou art to thyself.

49
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Such was the very armour he had on
when he the ambitious Norway combated.

50
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,800
So frown'd he once, when in an angry parle,
he smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.

51
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
- 'Tis strange.
- Thus twice before at this dead hour

52
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,400
with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.

53
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,400
In what particular thought to work I...

54
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
..I know not.

55
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,400
But in the gross and scope of mine opinion,

56
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,400
this bodes some strange eruption to our state.

57
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,400
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,

58
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,000
why this same strict and most observant watch
so nightly toils the subject of the land,

59
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,400
and why such daily cast of brazen cannon
and foreign mart for implements of war.

60
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,200
Who is't that can inform me?

61
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,800
That can I. At least the whisper goes so.

62
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,400
Our last king,
whose image even but now appear'd to us,

63
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,400
was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,

64
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,200
thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
dared to the combat;

65
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,400
in which our valiant Hamlet - for so
we esteem'd him - did slay this Fortinbras,

66
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,800
who by a seal'd compact,
well ratified by law and heraldry,

67
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,400
did forfeit, with his life, all his lands
which he stood seized of, to the conqueror.

68
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,600
Now, sir, young Fortinbras,

69
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,600
of unimproved mettle, hot and full,

70
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,200
hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes

71
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,600
for food to some enterprise
that hath a stomach in't,

72
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,000
which is none other,
as it doth well appear, but to recover of us,

73
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:39,800
by strong hand and terms compulsatory,
those foresaid lands so by his father lost.

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,400
This is the motive of our preparation.

75
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,800
I think it bee'en so. Well may it sort

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,400
that this portentous figure
comes armed so like the king

77
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,400
that was and is the question of these wars.

78
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,000
But soft. Behold where it comes again!

79
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,000
I'll cross it though it blast me.

80
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,400
Stay, illusion!

81
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,000
If thou hast any sound
or use of voice, speak to me.

82
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,800
If there be any good thing to be done
that may to thee do ease, speak to me!

83
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,600
(COCK CROWS)

84
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,600
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
which foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!

85
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,400
- Stop it, Marcellus.
- Shall I strike at it?

86
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Do, if it will not stand.

87
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
(BERNARDO ) 'Tis here!

88
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
'Tis here!

89
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,000
'Tis gone!

90
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,200
We do it wrong to offer it the show of violence,

91
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,200
for it is invulnerable,
and our vain blows malicious mockery.

92
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,400
- It was about to speak when the cock crew.
- Then it started as upon a fearful summons.

93
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,800
I have heard the cock,
that is the trumpet to the morn,

94
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,400
doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
awake the god of day,

95
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,600
and at his warning,
whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,

96
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,000
the extravagant and erring spirit
hies to his confine.

97
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,000
Of the truth herein,
this present object made probation.

98
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,800
It faded on the crowing of the cock.

99
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Some say that 'gainst that season
wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,

100
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,200
this bird of dawning singeth all night long.

101
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,200
And then no spirit dares stir abroad,
the nights are wholesome,

102
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,600
then no planets strike, no fairy takes,
nor witch hath power to charm,

103
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,200
so hallow'd and gracious is that time.

104
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,000
So have I heard and do in part believe it.

105
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:50,800
But look, the morn in russet mantle clad
walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.

106
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,200
Break we our watch up. Let us impart
what we have seen tonight unto young Hamlet.

107
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,000
For upon my life,
this spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.

108
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:08,800
Let's do't, I pray, and I this morning know
where we shall find him most convenient.

109
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
(APPLAUSE)

110
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,200
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
the memory be green,

111
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:33,600
and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief
and be contracted in one brow of woe,

112
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,400
yet so far hath discretion fought with nature

113
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,600
that we with wisest sorrow think on him
together with remembrance of ourselves.

114
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,000
Therefore our sometime sister,

115
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,600
now our queen,
the imperial jointress to this warlike state,

116
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,400
have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,

117
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,000
with one auspicious and one dropping eye,

118
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,600
with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,

119
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,400
in equal scale weighing delight and dole,

120
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
taken to wife.

121
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,400
Nor have we barr'd your better wisdoms,
which have gone with this affair along.

122
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,000
For all, our thanks.

123
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,600
Now follows that you know young Fortinbras,
holding a weak supposal of our worth,

124
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,000
or thinking by our late dear brother's death
our state to be disjoint,

125
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,800
he hath not fail'd to pester us,
importing surrender of lands

126
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,800
lost by his father to our most valiant brother.

127
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,400
So much for him. Now for ourself.
Thus much the business is:

128
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,200
we have here writ to Norway,
uncle of young Fortinbras -

129
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,600
who, impotent and bedrid,
scarcely hears of this his nephew's purpose -

130
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,800
to suppress his further gait herein, in that
the proportions are made out of his subject.

131
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,800
We here dispatch you,
Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,

132
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,800
for bearers of this greeting to old Norway;

133
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:13,600
giving you no further power to business
with the king more than these articles allow.

134
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,200
Farewell. Let your haste commend your duty.

135
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,800
- In all things will we show our duty.
- We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.

136
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,200
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?

137
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,000
You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?

138
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,800
You cannot speak of reason
to the Dane and lose your voice.

139
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,200
What wouldst thou beg
that shall not be my offer, not thy asking?

140
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,800
The head is not more native to the heart
than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.

141
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,000
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?

142
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,400
My dread lord, your leave to return to France,

143
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,000
from whence I came to Denmark
to show my duty in your coronation,

144
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,400
yet now I must confess, that duty done,

145
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,200
my thoughts bend again toward France
and bow them to your gracious pardon.

146
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,800
Have you your father's leave? Polonius?

147
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,400
He hath, my lord, wrung from me
my slow leave by laboursome petition,

148
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,200
and at last upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:

149
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,400
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.

150
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,800
Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
and thy best graces spend it at thy will.

151
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,400
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son.

152
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,400
A little more than kin, and less than kind.

153
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,600
- How is it the clouds still hang on you?
- Not so, my lord.

154
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,800
I am too much i' the sun.

155
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:06,400
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
and let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.

156
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
seek for thy noble father in the dust.

157
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:20,000
Thou know'st 'tis common - all that live must die,
passing through nature to eternity.

158
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
Ay, madam, it is common.

159
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,400
If it be,
why seems it so particular with thee?

160
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,800
"Seems", madam?!
Nay it is! I know not "seems".

161
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,

162
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,000
nor customary suits of solemn black,

163
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,400
nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
no, nor the fruitful river in the eye,

164
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,

165
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:52,200
together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
that can denote me truly.

166
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:58,600
These indeed seem,
for they are actions that a man might play.

167
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,400
But I have that within which passes show,

168
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,000
these but the trappings and the suits of woe.

169
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,200
'Tis sweet and commendable
to give these mourning duties to your father,

170
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,000
but you must know your father lost a father,
that father lost lost his,

171
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,800
and the survivor bound
in filial obligation to do obsequious sorrow.

172
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,400
But to persever in obstinate condolement
is a course of impious stubbornness.

173
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,400
'Tis unmanly grief.
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,

174
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,600
a heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
an understanding simple and unschool'd.

175
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:41,600
For what we know must be, why should we
in our peevish opposition take it to heart?

176
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Fie! 'Tis a fault to heaven,
a fault against the dead...

177
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,200
..a fault to nature, to reason most absurd,
whose common theme is death of fathers.

178
00:14:53,400 --> 00:15:00,000
We pray you, throw to earth this unprevailing
woe, and think of us as of a father.

179
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,800
For let the world take note,
you are the most immediate to our throne.

180
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:15,600
With no less nobility of love than that which
father bears his son, do I impart toward you.

181
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,400
For your intent
in going back to school in Wittenberg...

182
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,200
it is most retrograde to our desires,
and we beseech you, remain here

183
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,200
in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
our chiefest courtier, cousin, and son.

184
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
Stay with us. Go not to Wittenberg.

185
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,000
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.

186
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,000
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.

187
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,600
Be as ourself in Denmark.

188
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,600
Madam, come. This gentle and unforced accord
of Hamlet sits smiling to my heart,

189
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,800
in grace whereof no jocund health
but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell.

190
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,400
At the king's rouse, the heavens shall bruit again,
re-speaking earthly thunder.

191
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
Come away.

192
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:31,600
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt,
thaw and resolve itself into a dew.

193
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,600
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
his canon 'gainst self-slaughter!

194
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,400
O God.

195
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
God.

196
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,600
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable
seem to me all the uses of this world!

197
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,600
Fie on't. Oh, fie!

198
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,200
'Tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed.

199
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,000
Things rank and gross in nature
possess it merely.

200
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,600
That it should come to this.

201
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,000
But two months dead -
nay, not so much, not two -

202
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,600
so excellent a king,
that was to this Hyperion to a satyr...

203
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,000
..so loving to my mother

204
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
that he might not beteem the winds of heaven
visit her face too roughly.

205
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,000
Heaven and earth! Must I remember?

206
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:31,000
Why, she would hang on him as if
increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on.

207
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,600
And yet, within a month...

208
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,800
Let me not think on't.

209
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,800
Frailty, thy name is woman!

210
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,600
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
with which she follow'd my poor father's body,

211
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,600
like Niobe, all tears, why she, even she -

212
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,400
O, God! A beast that wants discourse
of reason would have mourn'd longer -

213
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,600
married with my uncle,

214
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,800
my father's brother,

215
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,800
but no more like my father than I to Hercules.

216
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,800
Within a month,

217
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,200
ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
had left her galled eyes, she married!

218
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:28,800
O, most wicked speed, to post
with such dexterity to incestuous sheets!

219
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,600
It is not nor it cannot come to good.

220
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,800
But break, my heart,
for I must hold my tongue.

221
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,600
- Hail to your lordship!
- I am glad to see thee well.

222
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,800
Horatio, or I do forget myself.

223
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,200
The same, my lord,
and your poor servant ever.

224
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,400
Sir, my good friend,
I'll change that name with you.

225
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,400
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?

226
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,200
- Marcellus?
- My good lord.

227
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,200
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
What in faith make you from Wittenberg?

228
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,000
- A truant disposition, good my lord.
- I would not hear your enemy say so.

229
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,200
What is your affair in Elsinore?
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.

230
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,600
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.

231
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,800
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student.
It was to see my mother's wedding.

232
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,200
- Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
- Thrift, Horatio.

233
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,400
The funeral baked meats
did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.

234
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,400
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
or ever I had seen that day.

235
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,200
My father... Methinks I see my father...

236
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Where, my lord?

237
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,400
In my mind's eye, Horatio.

238
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I saw him once; a was a goodly king.

239
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:11,000
He was a man, take him for all in all.
I shall not look upon his like again.

240
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,200
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.

241
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,600
- Saw who?
- My lord, the king your father.

242
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,000
- The king my father!
- Season your admiration for awhile

243
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,000
with an attent ear,
till I may deliver this marvel to you.

244
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
For God's love, let me hear.

245
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,000
Two nights together had Marcellus and Bernardo

246
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,000
on their watch in the middle of the night
been thus encounter'd.

247
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:44,000
A figure like your father, armed at point exactly,
cap-à-pie, appears before them

248
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,200
and with solemn march goes stately by them.

249
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Thrice he walk'd
by their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes

250
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,600
within his truncheon's length,

251
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,400
whilst they, distilled to jelly with the act of fear,
stand dumb and speak not to him.

252
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,600
This to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did,
and I with them kept the watch.

253
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,800
As they had deliver'd both in time,
form of the thing, each word made good.

254
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,600
The apparition comes. I knew your father.
These hands are not more like.

255
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,800
- But where was this?
- Upon the platform.

256
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
- Did you not speak to it?
- I did, but answer made it none.

257
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,000
Yet once methought it did address itself
to motion like it would speak,

258
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,800
but even then the morning cock crew loud,

259
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,800
and at its sound it shrunk in haste away
and vanish'd from our sight.

260
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,800
- 'Tis very strange.
- As I do live, 'tis true.

261
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,200
We did think it our duty to let you know of it.

262
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,000
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.

263
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,600
- Hold you the watch tonight?
- We do.

264
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,600
- Arm'd, you say? From top to toe?
- From head to foot.

265
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,200
- Then saw you not his face?
- He wore his beaver up.

266
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,000
- What look'd he, frowningly?
- More in sorrow.

267
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,600
- Pale or red?
- Very pale.

268
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
- Fix'd his eyes upon you?
- Most constantly.

269
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
- Would I had been there.
- It would have amazed you.

270
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,600
- Very like. Stay'd it long?
- One might tell a hundred.

271
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,400
- (BOTH) Longer.
- Not when I saw't.

272
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,600
His beard was grizzled...no?

273
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,800
It was as I have seen it in his life, a sable silver'd.

274
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,400
I will watch tonight.
Perchance 'twill walk again.

275
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,400
- I warrant it will.
- I'll speak to it,

276
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,400
though hell itself should bid me hold my peace.

277
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,000
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
let it be tenable in your silence still.

278
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,600
Whatsoever else shall hap tonight,
give it an understanding, but no tongue.

279
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,400
I will requite your loves. Fare you well.

280
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,800
Upon the platform
'twixt eleven and twelve I'll visit you.

281
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,200
- Our duty to your honour.
- Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.

282
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,000
My father's spirit...in arms.

283
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:10,200
All is not well. I doubt some foul play.
Would the night were come!

284
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,000
Till then sit still, my soul.

285
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,600
Foul deeds will rise,

286
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,600
though all the earth o'erwhelm them,
to men's eyes.

287
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,600
My necessaries are embark'd.

288
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:33,600
Farewell. And, sister, as the winds
give benefit and convoy is assistant,

289
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,000
do not sleep, but let me hear from you.

290
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,400
Do you doubt that?

291
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:46,400
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,

292
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,600
a violet in the youth of primy nature,
forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,

293
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,200
the perfume and suppliance of a minute, no more.

294
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,800
No more but so?

295
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,400
Think it no more.

296
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,400
Perhaps he loves you now, but you must fear,

297
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,200
his greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own.

298
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,600
For he himself is subject to his birth.

299
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,800
He may not,
as unvalued persons do, carve for himself,

300
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
for on his choice depends
the sanity of this whole state.

301
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,400
Therefore must his choice be circumscribed

302
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,600
unto the voice and yielding
of that body whereof he is the head.

303
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:34,400
Then if he says he loves you,
it fits your wisdom so far to believe it

304
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,000
as he in his particular act and place
may give his saying deed,

305
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,200
which is no further than the main voice
of Denmark goes withal.

306
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:49,000
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
if with too credent ear you list his songs

307
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,400
or lose your heart...or your chaste treasure
open to his unmaster'd importunity.

308
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,400
Fear it, Ophelia. Fear it, my dear sister...

309
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:07,600
..and keep you in the rear of your affection,
out of the shot and danger of desire.

310
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:13,600
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep
as watchman to my heart.

311
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,200
But good my brother,
do not, as some ungracious pastors do,

312
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,400
show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
whiles like a reckless libertine

313
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,200
himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
and recks not his own rede.

314
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
O, fear me not.

315
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,400
Yet here, Laertes!
Aboard, aboard, for shame!

316
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,200
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
and you are stay'd for.

317
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,800
There.

318
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,800
My blessing with thee!

319
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,800
And these few precepts
in thy memory look thou character.

320
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Give thy thoughts no tongue,
nor any unproportioned thought his act.

321
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,800
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.

322
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,200
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,

323
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,400
grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel,

324
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:12,400
but do not dull thy palm with entertainment
of each new-hatch'd, unfledged courage.

325
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,200
Beware of entrance to a quarrel,

326
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,400
but being in,
bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.

327
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,400
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice.

328
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,600
Take each man's censure,
but reserve thy judgment.

329
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,600
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
but not express'd in fancy. Rich, not gaudy,

330
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,800
for the apparel oft proclaims the man,
and they in France of the best station

331
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,800
are of a most select and generous choice in that.

332
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,200
Neither a borrower nor a lender be,

333
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:56,200
for loan oft loses both itself and friend,
and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.

334
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,200
This above all - to thine ownself be true,

335
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,200
and it must follow, as the night the day,
thou canst not then be false to any man.

336
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,200
Farewell, my blessing season this in thee.

337
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,000
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.

338
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,000
The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.

339
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,400
Farewell, Ophelia,
and remember well what I have said to you.

340
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:32,400
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
and you yourself shall keep the key of it.

341
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Farewell.

342
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,200
What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?

343
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,600
So please you,
something touching the Lord Hamlet.

344
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:01,200
Marry, well bethought. 'Tis told me,
he hath oft of late given private time to you,

345
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,400
and you yourself have
of your audience been free and bounteous.

346
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,800
What is between you? Hmm?
Give me up the truth.

347
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,800
He hath of late made many tenders
of his affection to me.

348
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Affection? (SCOFFS) Pooh!

349
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,400
You speak like a green girl,
unsifted in such perilous circumstance.

350
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,400
- Do you believe his "tenders"?
- I do not know what I should think.

351
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:34,400
Marry, I shall teach you. You have ta'en
tenders for true pay which are not sterling.

352
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:40,000
Tender yourself more dearly,
or you'll tender me a fool.

353
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,000
He hath importuned me
with love in honourable fashion.

354
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to.

355
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,400
And hath given countenance to his speech
with almost all the holy vows of heaven.

356
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,600
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks.

357
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:03,000
I do know, when the blood burns,
how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows.

358
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,000
These blazes, daughter,
giving more light than heat, extinct in both,

359
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,600
even in their promise as they are a-making,
you must not take for fire.

360
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,000
In few, Ophelia, do not believe his vows.

361
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,200
This is for all.
I would not, from this time forth,

362
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:27,000
have you so slander any moment's leisure
as to talk with the Lord Hamlet.

363
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Look to't, I charge you.

364
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,600
- Come your ways.
- I shall obey, my lord.

365
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,800
The air bites shrewdly.

366
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,000
- It is very cold.
- It is a nipping, eager air.

367
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,600
- What hour now?
- It lacks of twelve.

368
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,600
- No, it is struck.
- Indeed? I heard it not.

369
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,400
Then draws near the season
wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.

370
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,200
(FANFARE AND CANNONFIRE)

371
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,000
- What does this mean?
- The king doth take his rouse,

372
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,200
keeps wassail, and the swaggering upspring reels.

373
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,000
As he drains his draughts of Rhenish,

374
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,400
the kettle-drum and trumpet
thus bray out the triumph of his pledge.

375
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,800
- Is it a custom?
- Ay, marry, is't.

376
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,200
But to my mind, though I am to the manner born,

377
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,200
it is a custom more honour'd
in the breach than the observance.

378
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
This heavy-headed revel east and west
makes us tax'd of other nations.

379
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,800
They clepe us drunkards,
and with swinish phrase soil our addition.

380
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:51,400
Indeed it takes from our achievements
the pith and marrow of our attribute.

381
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,600
So, oft it chances in particular men

382
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:04,000
that for some vicious mole
of nature in them, as in their birth,

383
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,200
wherein they are not guilty,
since nature cannot choose his origin,

384
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:15,200
by the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,

385
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:20,200
or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
the form of plausive manners...

386
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,400
..that these men,
carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,

387
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:37,600
being nature's livery or fortune's star,
his virtues else as infinite as man may undergo,

388
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,600
shall in the general censure
take corruption from that particular fault.

389
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,800
Look, my lord! It comes!

390
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,000
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!

391
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,800
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,

392
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,200
bring with thee airs from heaven
or blasts from hell,

393
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,600
be thy intents wicked or charitable,
thou comest in such a questionable shape

394
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,400
that I will speak with thee.

395
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,400
I'll call thee Hamlet...king...

396
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,000
..Father...royal Dane...

397
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,200
O, answer me!
Let me not burst in ignorance,

398
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,800
but tell why thy canonized bones,
hearsed in death, have burst their cerements,

399
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,600
why the sepulchre,
wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,

400
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,800
hath oped his ponderous
and marble jaws to cast thee up again.

401
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,800
What may this mean, that thou,
dead corse, again in complete steel

402
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
making night hideous and we fools of nature

403
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:50,000
so horridly to shake our dispositions
with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?

404
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,000
Say, why is this? Wherefore?

405
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,200
What should we do?

406
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,200
It beckons,
as if it some impartment did desire with you.

407
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,200
- It waves you to removed ground. Do not go.
- By no means, my lord.

408
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,600
- I will follow it.
- Do not!

409
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,800
Why? I do not set my life in a pin's fee,

410
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,800
and for my soul, what can it do to that,
being immortal as itself?

411
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,400
It waves me forth. I'll follow it.

412
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,800
What if it tempt you toward the flood
or the summit of the cliff

413
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,000
and there assume some other horrible form,
which might draw you into madness?

414
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,400
- Think of it!
- It waves me still! Go on! I'll follow thee!

415
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,800
- You shall not go, my lord!
- Hold off your hands! My fate cries out

416
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,400
and makes each petty artery in this body
as hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve!

417
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,000
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.

418
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,000
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him
that lets me! I say away!

419
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Go on. I'll follow thee.

420
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,200
- He waxes desperate with imagination.
- Let's follow him.

421
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,600
- 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
- Have after.

422
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:06,000
- To what issue will this come?
- Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

423
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,800
- Heaven will direct it.
- Nay, let's follow him!

424
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,600
Whither wilt thou lead me?

425
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,600
Speak!

426
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,600
I'll go no further.

427
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,200
- Mark me.
- I will.

428
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Soon I to sulph'rous flames
must render up myself.

429
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,800
- Alas, poor ghost!
- Pity me not,

430
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,200
but lend me thy serious hearing.

431
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Speak. I am bound to hear.

432
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,800
So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear.

433
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,800
What?

434
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,600
I am thy father's spirit,

435
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,400
doom'd to walk the night,
and for the day confin'd to fast in fires,

436
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,000
till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
are burnt and purged away.

437
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:42,400
But that I am forbid, I could a tale unfold
whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul,

438
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:48,000
freeze thy young blood, make thy two eyes
like stars start from their spheres,

439
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,200
thy knotted locks to part,
and each hair to stand on end

440
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,800
like quills upon the fretful porpentine.

441
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,600
But this eternal blazon must not be to ears
of flesh and blood. List. O, list.

442
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
If thou didst ever thy dear father love...

443
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,600
- O God!
- ..revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.

444
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,800
- Murder?!
- Murder most foul,

445
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
as in the best it is,
but this most foul and unnatural.

446
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Haste me to know't,
that I with wings as swift as meditation

447
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,600
or the thoughts of love may sweep to my revenge.

448
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,600
I find thee apt. Duller shouldst thou be

449
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:35,000
than the fat weed that roots itself
on Lethe wharf, wouldst thou not stir.

450
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Now, Hamlet, hear.

451
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:44,400
'Tis given out that,
sleeping in my orchard, a serpent stung me -

452
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:49,800
so the whole ear of Denmark is by
a forged process of my death rankly abused -

453
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,000
but know, noble youth, the serpent that did sting
thy father's life now wears his crown.

454
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,600
O my prophetic soul. My uncle!

455
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,400
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
with witchcraft of his wit,

456
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,800
with traitorous gifts - O wicked wit
and gifts that have the power so to seduce! -

457
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,600
won to his shameful lust the will
of my most seeming-virtuous queen.

458
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,400
O Hamlet...what a falling-off was there,

459
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,000
from me, whose love was of that dignity

460
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,200
that it went hand in hand even
with the vow I made to her in marriage,

461
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,800
and to decline upon a wretch
whose natural gifts were poor to those of mine.

462
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,600
But virtue, as it never will be moved,
though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,

463
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,200
so lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,

464
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,800
will sate itself in a celestial bed
and prey on garbage!

465
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,200
But, soft, methinks I scent the morning air.
Brief let me be.

466
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,800
Sleeping within my orchard,
my custom always of the afternoon,

467
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,800
upon my secure hour thy uncle stole
with juice of cursed hebona in a vial,

468
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,400
and in the porches of my ears
did pour the leperous distilment,

469
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:24,400
whose effect holds such an enmity with blood
of man that it courses through the body,

470
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,800
and with a sudden vigour doth posset
and curd the thin and wholesome blood.

471
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:37,200
So did it mine,
and a most instant tetter bark'd about,

472
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:43,200
most lazar-like, with vile
and loathsome crust all my smooth body.

473
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,000
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand of life,

474
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,800
of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd,

475
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,200
cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,

476
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,200
no reckoning made, but sent to my account
with all my imperfections on my head.

477
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
- O, horrible.
- (HAMLET) O, horrible!

478
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,600
(GHOST) Most horrible.

479
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,200
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.

480
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,600
Let not the royal bed of Denmark
be a couch for damned incest.

481
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,400
But howsoever thou pursuest this act,
taint not thy mind,

482
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,400
nor let thy soul
contrive against thy mother aught.

483
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:41,600
Leave her to heaven and to those thorns
that in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her.

484
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,600
Fare thee well at once.

485
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:52,200
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near
and 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.

486
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,800
Adieu.

487
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,400
Adieu, adieu.

488
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,600
Remember me.

489
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,200
(SOBS)

490
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:24,200
(WAILS IN ANGUISH)
O all you host of heaven!

491
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
O earth!

492
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,600
What else? And shall I couple hell?

493
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,400
Fie! Fie!

494
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,000
Hold, hold, my heart!

495
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,600
And you, my sinews,
grow not instant old, but bear me stiffly up.

496
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:49,600
Remember thee? Ay, thou poor ghost, whiles
memory holds a seat in this distracted globe.

497
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,800
Remember thee?
Yea, from the table of my memory

498
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,800
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,

499
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,600
all saws of books, all forms, all pressures past

500
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,000
that youth and observation copied there,

501
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:07,600
and thy commandment all alone shall live
within the book and volume of my brain,

502
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,600
unmix'd with baser matter.

503
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,400
Yes.

504
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,200
Yes, by heaven. O most pernicious woman!

505
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,400
O villain. Villain! Smiling, damned villain!

506
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:29,600
My tables. Meet it is I set it down,
that one may smile, and smile, and be a villain -

507
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,400
at least it may be so in Denmark.

508
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:37,000
So, uncle, there you are!

509
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,600
Now to my word.
It is "Adieu, adieu, remember me."

510
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
I have sworn't.

511
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,800
(HORATIO ) My lord? My lord?

512
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,400
(MARCELLUS) Lord Hamlet?
(HORATIO ) Heaven secure him!

513
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,600
- So be it!
- (MARCELLUS) Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!

514
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,000
(SCREECHES) Hillo, ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

515
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,400
- Come, bird, come!
- How is't, my noble lord?

516
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,800
- What news?
- Wonderful!

517
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
- My lord, tell it.
- No, you will reveal it.

518
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,400
- Not I, by heaven.
- Nor I.

519
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,800
- How say you then, you'll be secret?
- Ay, by heaven, my lord.

520
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,400
There's ne'er a villain dwelling
in all Denmark...but he's an arrant knave.

521
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,600
There needs no ghost to tell us this.

522
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Why, you are in the right.
So I hold it fit that we shake hands and part,

523
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,400
you as your desire shall point you -
for every man hath desire, such as it is -

524
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,600
and for mine own poor part, I'll go pray.

525
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,800
- These are but wild and whirling words.
- I'm sorry they offend you, heartily.

526
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,400
- Yes faith, heartily.
- There's no offence.

527
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:47,400
Yes, by Saint Patrick,
but there is, Horatio, and much offence too.

528
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,000
Touching this vision here, it is an honest ghost.

529
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,400
For your desire to know what is between us,
o'ermaster't as you may.

530
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:01,000
Now, good friends, as you are friends,
scholars and soldiers, give me one request.

531
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,400
- What? We will.
- Never make known what you have seen.

532
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,000
- We will not.
- Nay, but swear't.

533
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,600
- In faith, not I.
- Nor I, in faith.

534
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,600
- Upon my sword.
- We have sworn already.

535
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,200
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed!

536
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,200
(GHOST) Swear.

537
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,000
(MANIACALLY) Boy, say'st thou so?
Art thou there, truepenny?

538
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:29,000
Come on! You hear this fellow
in the cellarage. Consent to swear.

539
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,400
- Propose the oath, my lord.
- Never to speak of this.

540
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,400
- Swear by my sword.
- (GHOST) Swear.

541
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,600
<i>Hic et ubique?
Then we'll shift our ground.</i>

542
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,000
Come hither and lay your hands
again upon my sword.

543
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,800
Swear never to speak of this that you have heard.

544
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,800
(GHOST) Swear by his sword.

545
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Well said, old mole!
Canst work in the earth so fast?

546
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,400
A worthy pioner!
Once more remove, good friends.

547
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,800
Day and night, but this is wondrous strange!

548
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,800
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.

549
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,400
There are more things in heaven and earth
than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

550
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:18,800
But come, here, as before, never,
how strange or odd soe'er I bear myself -

551
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,400
as I perchance hereafter shall think meet
to put an antic disposition on -

552
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,000
that you, seeing me, ne'er shall,

553
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:31,200
with arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase

554
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,200
as "Well, well, we know,"
or "We would and if we could,"

555
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,400
or "If we list to speak,"
or such ambiguous giving out,

556
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,600
to note that you know aught of me -
this do swear,

557
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,400
so grace and mercy at your most need help you.

558
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,800
(GHOST) Swear.

559
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Rest. Rest, perturbed spirit.

560
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,800
So...

561
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,600
Gentlemen,
with all my love I do commend me to you.

562
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,800
Let us go in together.

563
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,800
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray!

564
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,600
The time is out of joint.

565
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:30,000
O cursed spite, that ever I was born to set it right.

566
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,000
(GASPS, THEN LAUGHS DEMENTEDLY)

567
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,200
Nay, come, let's go together.

568
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,000
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.

569
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,200
- I will, my lord.
- You shall do marvellous wisely,

570
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,600
before you visit him,
to make inquire of his behavior.

571
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,000
My lord, I did intend it.

572
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,200
Marry, well said, very well said.

573
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,800
Look you, sir, inquire me first
what Danskers are in Paris,

574
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,200
and how, and where they keep,
what company, at what expense,

575
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,800
and finding by this drift of question
that they do know my son,

576
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,600
come you more nearer
than your particular demands will touch it:

577
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,400
Take you,
as 'twere some distant knowledge of him,

578
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:25,200
as thus - "I know his father
and his friends, and in part him."

579
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,800
- Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
- Very well, my lord.

580
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:37,400
"And in part him... But", you may say "not well,
and if't be he I mean, he's very wild,

581
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:41,800
"addicted...so and so." and there put on him
what forgeries you please,

582
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,800
marry, none so rank as may dishonour him,

583
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,600
but such wanton, wild and usual slips as
are companions most known to youth and liberty.

584
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,600
As gaming, my lord.

585
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:59,200
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing,

586
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,200
quarrelling...drabbing, you may go so far.

587
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,800
My lord, that would dishonour him.

588
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,600
'Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.

589
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,400
- But, my good lord...
- Wherefore should you do this?

590
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,800
- Ay, I would know that.
- Marry, sir, here's my drift -

591
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:23,200
you laying these slight sullies on my son,
your party in converse, him you would sound,

592
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,800
having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
the youth you breathe of guilty,

593
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,200
be assured he closes with you
in this consequence -

594
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,200
"Good sir,"' or "friend", or "gentleman",
according to the addition of man and country.

595
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,600
Very good, my lord.

596
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:46,000
And then, sir, does a this... Does...
What was I about to say?

597
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,400
I was about to say something. Where did I leave?

598
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,400
At "closes in the consequence", at "friend"
and "gentleman".

599
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,200
At "closes in the consequence"...?

600
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,800
Ay, marry! He closes thus -

601
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,200
"I know the gentleman. I saw him yesterday" -
or t'other day, with such, or such -

602
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:11,400
and as you say, "there was a gaming",
"there o'ertook in's rouse",

603
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:18,800
"there falling out at tennis", or perchance
"I saw him enter such a house of sale"...

604
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.

605
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,800
See you now, your bait of falsehood
takes this carp of truth.

606
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,600
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
with assays of bias,

607
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,400
by indirections find directions out.

608
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:40,200
So by my former lecture and advice,
shall you my son.

609
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,800
- You have me, have you not?
- My lord, I have.

610
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,600
- God be wi' you.
- Good my lord!

611
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,200
- Observe his inclination in yourself.
- I shall, my lord.

612
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,000
Let him ply his music.

613
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,000
- Well, my lord.
- Farewell.

614
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,400
How now, Ophelia!

615
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,600
(SOBS)

616
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,600
- What's the matter?
- My lord, I have been so affrighted!

617
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,400
With what, in the name of God?

618
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:16,600
My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,

619
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,400
no hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,

620
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:26,000
ungarter'd and down-gyved
to his ancle, pale as his shirt,

621
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:31,400
his knees knocking each other,
and with a look so piteous in purport

622
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:37,400
as if he had been loosed out of hell
to speak of horrors, he comes before me.

623
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,200
- Mad for thy love?
- My lord, I do not know, but I do fear it.

624
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,600
- What said he?
- He took me by the wrist and held me hard,

625
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:56,200
then goes he to the length of all his arm,
and with his other hand thus o'er his brow,

626
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:01,200
he falls to such perusal of my face
as he would draw it.

627
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,200
Long stay'd he so.
At last, a little shaking of mine arm

628
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,600
and thrice his head thus waving up and down...

629
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:18,800
..he raised a sigh so piteous and profound

630
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,400
as it did seem to shatter all his bulk
and end his being.

631
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,400
That done, he lets me go,

632
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:34,600
and with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
he seem'd to find his way without his eyes;

633
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:41,000
For out o' doors he went without their helps,
and to the last bended their light on me.

634
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,000
Come.

635
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:50,200
Go with me. I will go seek the king.

636
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,600
This is the very ecstasy of love.
Have you given him any hard words of late?

637
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:01,800
No, my lord, but I did repel his letters
and denied his access to me.

638
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,400
That hath made him mad.

639
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,800
I am sorry that with better judgment
I had not quoted him.

640
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,800
I fear'd he did but trifle,
and meant to wreck thee. Now I'm sorry.

641
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,400
Go we to the king. This must be known,

642
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:28,400
which, being kept close, might move
more grief to hide than hate to utter love.

643
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:37,200
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
Moreover that we much did long to see you,

644
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:41,800
the need we have to use you
did provoke our hasty sending.

645
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,200
Something have you heard
of Hamlet's...transformation.

646
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:51,200
So I call it, sith nor the exterior
nor the inward man resembles that it was.

647
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,400
What it should be,
more than his father's death,

648
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:59,400
that hath put him so much from
the understanding of himself, I cannot deeme of.

649
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:04,800
I entreat you both that,
being so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,

650
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,000
that you vouchsafe your rest here some little time,

651
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:14,400
so by your companies to draw him on
to pleasures and to gather, so much as you may,

652
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,200
whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
that, open'd, lies within our remedy.

653
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:25,200
Good gentlemen, two men there is not living
to whom he more adheres.

654
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:31,800
Both Your Majesties might put your dread
pleasures more into command than to entreaty.

655
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
But we both obey
and give up ourselves in the full bent

656
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,400
to lay our service freely at your feet.

657
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,200
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.

658
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,000
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.

659
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,200
And I beseech you instantly
to visit my too much changed son.

660
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,400
Heaven make our presence and our practises
pleasant and helpful to him.

661
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,800
Ay.

662
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,200
Amen.

663
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:03,200
The ambassadors from Norway,
my good lord, are joyfully return'd.

664
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,800
Thou still hast been the father of good news.

665
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Have I, my lord?

666
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:16,800
I assure my liege, I hold my duty as I hold
my soul, both to my God and my king,

667
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:23,600
and I do think - or else this brain hunts not
the trail of policy so sure as it did -

668
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,400
that I have found the very cause
of Hamlet's lunacy.

669
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,200
O, speak of that. That do I long to hear.

670
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:36,400
Give first admittance to the ambassadors.
My news shall be the fruit to that feast.

671
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,000
Thyself do grace to them and bring them in.

672
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:47,000
He tells me, dear Gertrude, he hath found
the source of all your son's distemper.

673
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,000
I doubt it is no other but the main,

674
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:54,400
his father's death and our...o'erhasty marriage.

675
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,000
Well...we shall sift him.

676
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,800
(APPLAUSE)

677
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:06,600
Welcome, my good friends!
Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?

678
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,200
Most fair return of greetings and desires.

679
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,400
Upon our first, he sent out
to suppress his nephew's levies,

680
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,800
which appear'd to be a preparation
'gainst the Polack.

681
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Better look'd into, he truly found
it was against Your Highness,

682
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:26,400
whereat grieved that so his sickness
and impotence was falsely borne in hand,

683
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:32,000
sends out arrests on Fortinbras, which he,
in brief, obeys, receives rebuke from Norway,

684
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,600
and in fine makes vow never more to give
the assay of arms against Your Majesty.

685
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:46,200
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy, gives
him threescore thousand crowns in annual fee

686
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:51,800
and his commission to employ those soldiers
so levied as before against the Polack,

687
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:56,000
with an entreaty
that it might please you to give quiet pass

688
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,200
through your dominions for this enterprise

689
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,600
on such regards of safety and allowance
as therein are set down.

690
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,400
It likes us well. Go to your rests.

691
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,800
At night we'll feast together.
Most welcome home.

692
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,000
This business is well ended.

693
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:33,400
My liege and madam, to expostulate
what majesty should be, what duty is,

694
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:40,000
why day is day, night night, and time is time,
were but to waste night, day and time.

695
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,800
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,

696
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,600
and tediousness the limbs
and outward flourishes, I will be brief.

697
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,200
Your noble son is mad.

698
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:59,400
Mad call I it, for to define true madness,
what is't but to be nothing else but mad?

699
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,000
- But let that go.
- More matter with less art.

700
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:09,000
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
That he is mad, 'tis true.

701
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,800
'Tis true 'tis pity, and pity 'tis 'tis true.

702
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,600
A foolish figure - but farewell it, I will use no art.

703
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:23,000
Mad let us grant him, then. And now remains
that we find out the cause of this effect,

704
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:29,200
or rather say, the cause of this defect,
for this effect defective comes by cause.

705
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,600
Thus it remains and the...remainder thus.

706
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:38,600
Perpend. I have a daughter -
have while she is mine -

707
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:43,400
who in her duty and obedience,
mark, hath given me this.

708
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,000
Now gather and surmise.

709
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:53,600
"To the celestial and my soul's idol,
the most beautified Ophelia..."

710
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:59,200
That's an ill phrase. It's a vile phrase.
"Beautified" is a vile phrase.

711
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:06,200
But you shall hear. Thus, "ln her excellent
white bosom, these...et cetera"

712
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,200
Came this from Hamlet to her?

713
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,200
Good madam, stay awhile, I will be faithful.

714
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:18,000
"Doubt thou the stars are fire,
Doubt that the sun doth move,

715
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,800
"Doubt truth to be a liar,
But never doubt I love.

716
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,800
"O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers.

717
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:31,400
"I have not art to reckon my groans,
but that I love thee best, O more best, believe it.

718
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:35,000
"Adieu. Thine evermore most dear lady,

719
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,600
"whilst this machine is to him, Hamlet."

720
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,200
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me.

721
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,200
But how hath she received his love?

722
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,600
- What do you think of me?
- As of a man honourable.

723
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,800
I would fain prove so.

724
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,600
But what might you think,
when I had seen this hot love on the wing -

725
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,800
as I perceived it before my daughter told me -

726
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:07,400
what might you or your queen here think
if I had play'd the desk or table-book,

727
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:13,200
or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
or look'd upon this love with idle sight.

728
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,800
What might you think?
No, I went round to work

729
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:23,400
and my young mistress thus I did bespeak,
"Lord Hamlet is a prince. This must not be."

730
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,800
Then I prescripts gave her,
that she should lock herself from his resort,

731
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,200
admit no messengers, receive no tokens.

732
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:36,000
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
And he, repelled - a short tale to make -

733
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:40,200
fell into a sadness, thence to a watch,
thence into a weakness,

734
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,200
thence into a lightness, and by this declension,

735
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,000
into the madness wherein now he raves,
and all we mourn for.

736
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,400
Do you think 'tis this?

737
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:55,400
- It may be, very likely.
- Take this from this if this be otherwise.

738
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,800
How may we try it further?

739
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
You know sometimes he walks four hours
together here in the lobby.

740
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,800
At such a time, I'll loose my daughter to him.

741
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,600
Be you and I behind an arras then,
mark the encounter.

742
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:19,400
If he love her not, let me be no assistant
for a state, but keep a farm and carters.

743
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,600
We will try it.

744
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:26,600
But look where sadly
the poor wretch comes reading.

745
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:42,400
Away, I do beseech you, both away.
I'll board him presently.

746
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:55,400
- How does my good Lord Hamlet?
- Well... God-a-mercy.

747
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,800
- Do you know me, my lord?
- Excellent well.

748
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,800
- You are a fishmonger.
- Not I.

749
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,400
- Then I would you were so honest a man.
- Honest?

750
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:29,800
To be honest, as this world goes,
is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.

751
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:36,200
- That's very true, my lord.
- If the sun breed maggots in a dead dog...

752
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,600
- Have you a daughter?
- I have, my lord.

753
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:46,800
Let her not walk i' the sun. Conception
is a blessing, but as your daughter may conceive,

754
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,600
friend, look to 't.

755
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,800
How say you by that?
Still harping on my daughter.

756
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,800
Yet he knew me not, said I was a fishmonger.
A is far gone, far gone.

757
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
And yet in my youth I suffered
much extremity for love, very near this.

758
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,400
I'll speak to him again.

759
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,600
What do you read, my lord?

760
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,000
Words.

761
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,600
Words. Words.

762
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,000
What is the matter, my lord?

763
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:21,200
- Between who?
- I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.

764
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:28,000
Slanders, sir. For the satirical rogue
says here that old men have grey beards,

765
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:33,600
that their faces are wrinkled, their eyes
purging thick amber and plum-tree gum...

766
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,000
..that they have a plentiful lack of wit
and weak hams,

767
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,400
all which, though I most potently believe,

768
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:48,600
yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down,
for you yourself, sir, shall grow old as I am,

769
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:52,200
if like a crab you could go backward.

770
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,000
(CHUCKLES)

771
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,200
Though this be madness, yet there is method in't.

772
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,400
I'll speak to him again.

773
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:04,800
- My lord, will you walk out of the air.
- lnto my grave?

774
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Indeed, that's out of the air.

775
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:13,800
How pregnant sometimes his replies are!
My lord, I will take my leave of you.

776
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:20,200
You cannot, sir, take from me anything
that I will more willingly part withal...

777
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,800
except my life...

778
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
except my life...except my life!

779
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,400
Fare you well, my lord.

780
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,200
These tedious old fools.

781
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,800
You seek the Lord Hamlet.

782
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,400
- There he is.
- God save you, sir.

783
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,400
- My honoured lord!
- My most dear lord!

784
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,600
My excellent good friends!

785
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:59,200
How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz.

786
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,200
Good lads, how do ye both?

787
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,000
- As the indifferent children of the earth.
- Happy in that we are not over-happy.

788
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:11,600
- On fortune's cap we are not the button.
- Nor the soles of her shoe.

789
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:16,200
- Then you live about her waist.
- Faith, her privates we.

790
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,600
(ALL LAUGH COARSELY)

791
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,400
In the secret parts of fortune?

792
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:27,200
O, 'tis true...she is a strumpet.

793
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,000
What news?

794
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:37,200
None, my lord...but that the world's grown honest.

795
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,200
Then is doomsday near.

796
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,600
But your news is not true.

797
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:48,000
Let me question more in particular.
What have you, my good friends,

798
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:52,400
deserved at the hands of fortune,
that she sends you to prison hither?

799
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,600
- Prison, my lord?
- Denmark's a prison.

800
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:59,800
- Then is the world one.
- One in which there are many dungeons.

801
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,200
- Denmark being one of the worst.
- We think not so.

802
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:08,400
Then, 'tis none to you.
For there is nothing either good or bad

803
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,000
but thinking makes it so.

804
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
To me it is a prison.

805
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,600
Why, then your ambition makes it one;
'tis too narrow for your mind.

806
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:24,400
O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell
and count myself a king of infinite space

807
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:29,600
were it not that...l have bad dreams.

808
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,200
Which dreams indeed are ambition,

809
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:37,200
for the very substance of the ambitious
is merely the shadow of a dream.

810
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:41,000
A dream itself is but a shadow.
Shall we to the court?

811
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,800
- (BOTH) We'll wait upon you.
- No such matter.

812
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:50,200
I will not sort you with the rest of my servants,
for I am most dreadfully attended.

813
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,400
But, in the beaten way of friendship,
what make you at Elsinore?

814
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:59,200
To visit you, my lord. No other occasion.

815
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:04,800
Beggar that I am,
I am even poor in thanks, but I thank you.

816
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:10,200
And sure, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were you not sent for?

817
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,000
Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation?

818
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,600
Come, come. Deal justly with me.

819
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,600
Come. Nay, speak.

820
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:24,800
- What should we say, my lord?
- Why, anything, but to the purpose.

821
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,000
You were sent for.
There is a kind of confession in your looks,

822
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,200
which your modesties
have not craft enough to colour:

823
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:37,200
I know the good king and queen
have sent for you.

824
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:41,000
- To what end, my lord?
- That you must teach me.

825
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:48,400
But let me conjure you, by the rights
of our fellowship and the obligation of our love,

826
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,800
be even and direct with me
whether you were sent for or no?

827
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,600
- What say you?
- Nay, then I have an eye of you!

828
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,200
If you love me, hold not off.

829
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,600
My lord, we were sent for.

830
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:07,200
I will tell you why, so shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery,

831
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:12,000
and your secrecy
to the king and queen moult no feather.

832
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:19,800
I have of late,
but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth,

833
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,000
forgone all custom of exercises,
and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition

834
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:30,200
that this goodly frame, the earth,
seems to me a sterile promontory...

835
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:38,400
..this most excellent canopy, the air,
look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament,

836
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:42,800
this majestical roof fretted with golden fire...

837
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:50,800
..why, it appears no other thing to me than
a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.

838
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,600
What a piece of work is a man.

839
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:02,800
How noble in reason, how infinite in faculties,

840
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,000
in form and moving how express and admirable,

841
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,400
in action how like an angel,

842
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:14,400
in apprehension how like a god -

843
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,200
the beauty of the world,

844
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,400
the paragon of animals...

845
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:29,000
And yet, to me...
what is this quintessence of dust?

846
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,000
- Man delights not me.
- (LAUGHS)

847
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:41,400
No, nor woman neither,
though by your smiling you seem to say so.

848
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:47,200
- There was no such stuff in my thoughts.
- Why did you laugh then?

849
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:52,200
To think if you delight not in man,
what entertainment the players shall receive.

850
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,400
We coted them on the way.
Hither are they coming to offer you service.

851
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:03,000
He that plays the king shall be welcome.
His Majesty shall have tribute of me.

852
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:08,000
- What players are they?
- Those you were wont to take delight in.

853
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,200
How chances it they travel?

854
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:14,000
Their residence, both in reputation
and profit, was better both ways.

855
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:17,200
Their inhibition comes
by means of the late innovation.

856
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,200
Do they hold the same estimation as they did?

857
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,400
- No, indeed.
- Do they grow rusty?

858
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:27,200
Their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace,
but there is an eyrie of children,

859
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:33,400
little eyases, that cry out on the top of question
and are most tyrannically clapped for't.

860
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,400
These are now the fashion,
and so berattle the common stages

861
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:42,000
that many wearing rapiers are afraid
of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.

862
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:47,000
What, are they children? Will they pursue
the quality no longer than they can sing?

863
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:51,400
Will they not say when they shall grow
themselves to common players?

864
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,200
Their writers make them exclaim
against their own succession.

865
01:08:55,400 --> 01:09:01,200
There's been much to do. The nation
holds it no sin to tar them to controversy.

866
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:07,000
It is not very strange,
for my uncle is the king of Denmark,

867
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,600
and those that would make mows at him
while my father lived

868
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:15,000
now give a hundred ducats apiece
for his picture in little.

869
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:20,000
'Sblood, there is something in this
more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.

870
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,200
(FANFARE)

871
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:26,600
There are the players. Gentlemen,
you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands.

872
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:30,600
The appurtenance of welcome is fashion.
Let me comply with you in this garb.

873
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:37,400
You are welcome. But my uncle-father
and aunt-mother are deceived.

874
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,000
In what, my dear lord?

875
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:43,000
I am but mad north-north-west.

876
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:49,600
When the wind is southerly,
I know a hawk from a handsaw.

877
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,200
- Well be with you, gentlemen.
- Hark you, Guildenstern,

878
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,600
and you - at each ear a hearer.

879
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,200
That great baby is not yet
out of his swaddling-clouts.

880
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:04,600
I will prophesy he comes to tell me
of the players; mark it.

881
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,000
You say right, sir,
Monday morning; 'twas then indeed.

882
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,200
My lord, I have news.

883
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:17,400
(MOCKINGLY) My lord, I have news to tell you.
When Roscius was an actor in Rome.

884
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,400
- The actors are come hither, my lord.
- Buzz, buzz!

885
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,800
- Upon my honour...
- Then came each actor on his ass...

886
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,400
The best actors in the world,
either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral,

887
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,400
pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
tragical-historical...

888
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,200
(BOTH)
..tragical-comical-historical-pastoral...

889
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,200
..scene individable or poem unlimited -

890
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:41,800
Seneca cannot be too heavy
or Plautus too light. These are the only men.

891
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,800
O Jephthah, judge of lsrael,
what a treasure hadst thou!

892
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,400
- What a treasure had he, my lord?
- Why, "One fair daughter and no more,

893
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,800
"The which he loved passing well."

894
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,200
- Still on my daughter.
- Am I not in the right?

895
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:03,200
I have a daughter that I love passing well.

896
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:08,000
- Nay, that follows not.
- What follows, then, my lord?

897
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:14,400
Why, "As by lot...God wot..."

898
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,200
But look where my abridgement comes!

899
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,200
(LAUGHTER AND MUSIC)

900
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:33,800
Welcome, all. I am glad to see thee well.

901
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,800
Welcome, good friends.

902
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,600
Ah, my old friend!

903
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:48,800
Why, thy face is valenced since I saw thee last.
Com'st thou to beard me in Denmark?

904
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,400
What, my young lady and mistress?

905
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:58,200
Your ladyship is nearer to heaven than
when I saw you last by the altitude of a chopine.

906
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:04,800
Pray God your voice, like apiece
of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring.

907
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
(SINGS HIGH NOTE)

908
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,400
Masters, you are all welcome.

909
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,400
We'll e'en to't like French falconers,
fly at anything we see.

910
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:19,000
We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us
a taste of your quality, a passionate speech.

911
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:25,800
- What speech, my good lord?
- I heard thee speak me a speech once,

912
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,800
but it was never acted, or not above once,
for the play pleased not the million.

913
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,000
'Twas caviare to the general.
One speech in it I chiefly loved.

914
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,200
'Twas Aeneas' tale to Dido,

915
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:45,000
and thereabout of it especially
where he speaks of Priam's slaughter.

916
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:49,000
If it live within your memory,
begin at this line -

917
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:55,200
let me see, let me see... "The rugged Pyrrhus,
like the Hyrcanian beast..."

918
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:59,600
No. 'Tis not so. It begins with Pyrrhus.

919
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:07,000
"The rugged Pyrrhus...he whose sable arms,

920
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:10,000
"Black as his purpose, did the night resemble

921
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,600
"When he lay couched in the ominous horse,

922
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,800
"Hath now this dread
and black complexion smear'd

923
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
"With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot

924
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:24,800
"Now is he total gules, roasted in wrath and fire,

925
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
"And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,

926
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:32,600
"With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus

927
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,200
"Old grandsire Priam seeks."

928
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,000
- So, proceed you.
- 'Fore God, my lord, well spoken,

929
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,800
with good accent and good discretion.

930
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:55,800
"Anon he finds him,
Striking too short at Greeks.

931
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:00,600
"His antique sword,
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,

932
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:05,200
"Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,

933
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:09,200
"Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;

934
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,400
"But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword

935
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,400
"The unnerved father falls.

936
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:21,400
"Then senseless llium,
Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top

937
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:27,200
"Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear..."

938
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:32,000
- This is too long.
- It shall to the barber's with your beard!

939
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:38,200
Prithee, say on. He's for a jig
or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps.

940
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:43,800
Say on. Come to Hecuba.

941
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:52,600
- "But who had seen the mobbled queen..."
- The mobbled queen.

942
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,200
Oh, that's good. Mobbled queen's good.

943
01:14:55,800 --> 01:15:00,200
"..run barefoot up and down,
threat'ning the flames

944
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:08,200
"With bisson rheum, a clout upon that head
Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,

945
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:14,400
"About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up -

946

"Who this had seen,
with tongue in venom steep'd,

947
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,600
"'Gainst Fortune's state
would treason have pronounced:

948

"But if the gods themselves did see her then,

949
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,800
"When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport

950

"In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,

954

"And passion in the gods!"

955
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:55,200
Look, whe'er he has not changed his colour
and has tears in's eyes. Prithee no more.

956
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
'Tis well.

957
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I'll have thee speak out the rest of this...soon.

958
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:12,600
Good my lord,
will you see the players well bestowed?

959
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:19,600
Let them be well used, for they are
the abstract and brief chronicles of the time.

960
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:27,200
After your death you were better have
a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.

961
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:33,200
- I shall use them according to their desert.
- God's bodykins, man, much better.

962
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:40,800
Use every man after his desert
and who shall 'scape whipping?

963
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,200
Use them after your own honour and dignity.

964
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:49,600
The less they deserve,
the more merit is in your bounty.

965
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,800
Take them in.

966
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,800
Come...sirs.

967
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play tomorrow.

968
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:06,600
Dost thou hear me, old friend.
Can you play "The Murder of Gonzago"?

969
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,400
- Ay, my lord.
- We'll ha't tomorrow night.

970
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:13,000
You could study a speech of some dozen lines,

971
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,800
which I would set down
and insert in't, could you not?

972
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,800
- Ay, my lord.
- Very well. Follow that lord,

973
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,800
and look you mock him not.

974
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,800
- My good friends!
- (THEY LAUGH)

975
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,200
I'll leave you till night.
You are welcome to Elsinore.

976
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,800
- Good my lord.
- Ay, so.

977
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
God buy you.

978
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,600
Now...

979
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,800
..I am alone.

980
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:18,200
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I.

981
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:24,400
Is it not monstrous that this player here,

982
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:29,800
but in a fiction, in a dream of passion,

983
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:36,800
could force his soul so to his own conceit
that from her working all his visage wann'd,

984
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:44,800
tears in his eyes,
distraction in's aspect, a broken voice,

985
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:51,000
and his whole function suiting
with forms to his conceit?

986
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,600
And all for nothing.

987
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,200
For Hecuba!

988
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:04,600
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
that he should weep for her?

989
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:13,000
What would he do had he the motive
and the cue for passion that I have?

990
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:17,800
He would drown the stage with tears

991
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,200
and cleave the general ear with horrid speech,

992
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:24,400
make mad the guilty and appal the free,

993
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:30,000
confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
the very faculties of eyes and ears.

994
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:36,600
Yet I, a dull and muddy-mettled rascal,
peak like John-a-dreams,

995
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:43,400
unpregnant of my cause, and can say nothing...

996
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:47,600
no...not for a king...

997
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:53,800
..upon whose property
and most dear life a damn'd defeat was made.

998
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Am I a coward?

999
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:06,000
Who calls me villain, breaks my pate across,
plucks off my beard and blows it in my face,

1000
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:10,400
tweaks me by the nose, gives me the lie
in the throat as deep as to the lungs?

1001
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,800
Who does me this? Ha!

1002
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,200
'Swounds, I should take it,

1003
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:20,200
for I am pigeon-liver'd
and lack gall to make oppression bitter,

1004
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:26,200
or ere this I should have fatted
all the region kites with this slave's offal.

1005
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:34,000
Bloody, bawdy villain!

1006
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:40,400
Remorseless, treacherous,
lecherous, kindless villain!

1007
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,400
O, vengeance!

1008
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,200
Why, what an ass am l!

1009
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:58,000
This is most brave,

1010
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,400
that I, the son of a dear father murder'd,

1011
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:08,000
prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
must like a whore unpack my heart with words,

1012
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:14,000
and fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
a scullion! Fie upon't! Foh!

1013
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,200
About, my brain.

1014
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:31,000
I have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play

1015
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:35,800
have by the very cunning of the scene
been struck so to the soul

1016
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,000
that presently
they have proclaim'd their malefactions,

1017
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:46,600
for murder, though it have no tongue,
will speak with most miraculous organ.

1018
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:51,400
I'll have these players play something
like my father's murder before mine uncle.

1019
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,800
I'll observe his looks. I'll tent him to the quick.

1020
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,200
If he but blench, I know my course.

1021
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:04,200
The spirit that I have seen may be a devil,

1022
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:08,400
and the devil hath power
to assume a pleasing shape,

1023
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:17,200
yea...and perhaps out of my weakness
and my melancholy,

1024
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:22,200
as he is very potent
with such spirits, abuses me

1025
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:26,000
to damn...me.

1026
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:32,000
I'll have grounds more relative than this.

1027
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,000
The play's the thing

1028
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:45,200
wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

1029
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:55,600
Can you, by no drift of conference,
get from him why he puts on this confusion,

1030
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:01,600
grating so harshly all his days of quiet
with turbulent and dangerous lunacy?

1031
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:06,400
He does confess he feels himself distracted,
but from what cause will by no means speak.

1032
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,600
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,

1033
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:16,000
but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when
we would bring him on to confess his true state.

1034
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:19,000
- Did he receive you well?
- Like a gentleman.

1035
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:23,800
- But with much forcing of his disposition.
- Niggard of question, but free in his reply.

1036
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:29,000
- Did you assay him to any pastime?
- Certain players we o'erraught on the way.

1037
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:34,000
There did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it:

1038
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:37,000
They have already order to play before him.

1039
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:41,800
'Tis most true. He beseech'd me to entreat
Your Majesties to see the matter.

1040
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,600
With all my heart, and it doth
much content me to hear him so inclined.

1041
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:51,400
Good gentlemen,
drive his purpose in to these delights.

1042
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,800
- We shall, my lord.
- Sweet Gertrude, leave us too,

1043
01:23:54,800 --> 01:24:02,400
for we have sent for Hamlet hither that he,
as 'twere by accident, may here affront Ophelia.

1044
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:07,000
Her father and myself, lawful espials,
will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,

1045
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:12,200
we may of their encounter frankly judge,
and gather by him, as he is behaved,

1046
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:17,000
if't be th'affliction of his love or no
that thus he suffers for.

1047
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I shall obey you.

1048
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:28,200
Ophelia, I do wish that your good beauties
be the happy cause of Hamlet's wildness.

1049
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:33,200
So shall I hope your virtues
will bring him to his wonted ways again,

1050
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,400
to both your honours.

1051
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:38,200
Madam, I wish it may.

1052
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,600
Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious,
so please you, we will bestow ourselves.

1053
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:50,400
Read on this book, that show of such
an exercise may colour your loneliness.

1054
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:56,600
We are oft to blame in this. With pious action
we do sugar o'er the devil himself.

1055
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,600
O, 'tis too true.

1056
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:04,400
How smart a lash
that speech doth give my conscience.

1057
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,800
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,

1058
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:14,600
is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
than is my deed to my most painted word.

1059
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:20,200
- O heavy burden!
- I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.

1060
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,400
To be...or not to be...

1061
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,200
that is the question -

1062
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:14,200
whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,

1063
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:18,200
or to take arms against a sea of troubles,

1064
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:22,800
and by opposing end them.

1065
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
To die...

1066
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,200
..to sleep...

1067
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:37,200
..no more, and by a sleep
to say we end the heart-ache

1068
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:41,600
and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to,

1069
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:45,600
'tis a consummation devoutly to be wish'd.

1070
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,400
To die...

1071
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,600
..to sleep...

1072
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:59,000
...to sleep, perchance to dream.

1073
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:05,000
Ay, there's the rub.

1074
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:11,000
For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come

1075
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:17,600
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
must give us pause.

1076
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:22,400
There's the respect
that makes calamity of so long life.

1077
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:29,400
For who would bear the whips
and scorns of time, the oppressor's wrong,

1078
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,800
the proud man's contumely...

1079
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,400
..the pangs of despised love...

1080
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:42,600
..the law's delay, the insolence of office,
the spurns that merit of the unworthy takes,

1081
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,800
when he himself might his quietus make
with a bare bodkin?

1082
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:51,200
Who would these fardels bear,

1083
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:57,200
to grunt and sweat under a weary life,

1084
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:03,800
but that the dread of something after death...

1085
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,800
the undiscover'd country

1086
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:15,800
from whose bourn
no traveller returns, puzzles the will...

1087
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,800
and makes us rather bear those ills we have

1088
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,200
than fly to others that we know not of?

1089
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:31,800
Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all,

1090
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:38,000
and thus the native hue of resolution is
sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,

1091
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:47,400
and enterprises of great pitch and moment
with this regard their currents turn awry...

1092
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,400
and lose the name of action.

1093
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,600
Soft you now, the fair Ophelia!

1094
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:15,400
Nymph, in thy orisons
be all my sins remember'd.

1095
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,200
Good my lord,
how does your honour for this many a day?

1096
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:24,200
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)

1097
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:29,400
I humbly thank you. Well, well, well.

1098
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:35,200
My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
that I have longed long to redeliver.

1099
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:39,000
- I pray you, now receive them.
- No, not I.

1100
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:41,600
I never gave you aught.

1101
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:45,600
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,

1102
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:52,600
and with them words of so sweet breath
composed as made the things more rich.

1103
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:57,200
Their perfume lost, take these again,

1104
01:29:57,400 --> 01:30:03,600
for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor
when givers prove unkind.

1105
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,400
- There, my lord.
- Ha... Ha...

1106
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,800
- Are you honest?
- My lord?

1107
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:14,200
- Are you fair?
- What means your lordship?

1108
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:18,200
Your honesty should admit
no discourse to your beauty.

1109
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:21,200
Could beauty have better commerce
than with honesty?

1110
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:28,000
Ay, for the power of beauty will sooner
transform honesty from what it is into a bawd

1111
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:31,400
than honesty can translate beauty
into his likeness.

1112
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:36,400
This was sometime a paradox,
but now the time gives it proof.

1113
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:41,400
I did love you...once.

1114
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:48,000
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.

1115
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:53,800
You should not have believed me,

1116
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,400
for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock

1117
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,000
but we shall relish of it.

1118
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,200
I loved you not.

1119
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:06,600
I was the more deceived.

1120
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:14,400
Get thee to a nunnery.
Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?

1121
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Myself, I could accuse me of such things
that it were better my mother had not borne me.

1122
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:29,200
(SHOUTS) I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious,

1123
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:34,200
with more offences at my beck
than I have time to act them in.

1124
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:40,800
What should such fellows as I do?
We are arrant knaves, all. Believe none of us.

1125
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:49,200
Go thy ways to a nunnery.

1126
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,600
Where's your father?

1127
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,400
At home, my lord.

1128
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:10,000
Let the doors be shut upon him,

1129
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:15,800
(SOBS) that he may play the fool
nowhere but in his own house.

1130
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,600
- Farewell.
- O, help him, you sweet heavens!

1131
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:24,600
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague
for thy dowry - be thou as pure as snow,

1132
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:28,200
thou shalt not escape calumny.
Get thee to a nunnery.

1133
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:32,400
Or if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool.

1134
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:37,400
For wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them.

1135
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:40,400
To a nunnery, go, and quickly too. Farewell.

1136
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:45,200
- Heavenly powers, restore him!
- I have heard of your paintings too!

1137
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:49,800
God has given you one face,
you make another. You jig, amble, lisp,

1138
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,600
you nick-name God's creatures,
you make your wantonness your ignorance.

1139
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:56,200
Go to, I'll no more on't!

1140
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:07,400
It hath made me mad.

1141
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,800
I say, we will have no more marriages.

1142
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:23,200
Those that are married already,
all but one, shall live.

1143
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:26,000
The rest shall keep as they are.

1144
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,000
To a nunnery, go.

1145
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:38,600
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!

1146
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:46,200
The courtier's, soldier's,
scholar's, eye, tongue, sword,

1147
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:53,000
the expectancy and rose of the fair state,
the glass of fashion and the mould of form,

1148
01:33:53,200 --> 01:34:00,000
the observed of all observers, quite, quite down.

1149
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:08,400
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched...

1150
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:17,800
..that suck'd the honey of his music vows,
now see that noble and most sovereign reason

1151
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:24,600
like sweet bells jangled out of time and harsh,

1152
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:30,200
that unmatch'd form and feature
of blown youth blasted with ecstasy.

1153
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:38,000
O, woe is me to have seen what I have seen...

1154
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
..see what I see.

1155
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Love? His affections do not that way tend,

1156
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:00,400
nor what he spake, though it lack'd form
a little, was not like madness.

1157
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:05,800
There's something in his soul
o'er which his melancholy sits on brood.

1158
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:09,000
I do doubt the hatch will be some danger,

1159
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:15,400
which to prevent, he shall to England
for the demand of our neglected tribute.

1160
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:19,800
Haply the seas and countries different
with variable objects

1161
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,000
shall expel this something-settled
matter in his heart,

1162
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,600
whereon his brains still beating
puts him from fashion of himself.

1163
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:35,400
It shall do well, but yet do I believe
his grief sprung from neglected love.

1164
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:40,800
How now, Ophelia. You need not tell us
what Lord Hamlet said. We heard it all.

1165
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,800
My lord, do as you please, but if you hold it fit,

1166
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,400
after the play let his queen-mother
entreat him to show his grief.

1167
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:54,800
Let her be round with him.
I'll be placed in the ear of their conference.

1168
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,200
If she find him not, to England send him,

1169
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:02,000
or confine him
where your wisdom best shall think.

1170
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,800
It shall be so.

1171
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,400
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.

1172
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:46,200
Speak the speech as I pronounced it to you,
trippingly on the tongue,

1173
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:51,200
but if you mouth it, I had as lief
the town-crier spoke my lines.

1174
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:57,600
Nor do not saw the air too much
with your hands, thus, but use all gently;

1175
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:03,600
for in the very torrent, tempest,
and, as I may say, whirlwind of your passion,

1176
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:07,000
you must acquire a temperance
that may give it smoothness.

1177
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:11,200
- I warrant your honour.
- Be not too tame neither.

1178
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:13,800
Let your own discretion be your tutor.

1179
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,600
Suit the action to the word, the word to the action;

1180
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:23,000
with this special observance,
that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature.

1181
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:26,600
For anything so overdone
is from the purpose of playing,

1182
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,400
whose end, both at the first and now,

1183
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:33,800
was and is to hold,
as 'twere, the mirror up to nature,

1184
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,400
to show virtue her own feature,
scorn her own image,

1185
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:43,200
and the very age and body of the time
his form and pressure.

1186
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:49,400
Now this overdone, or come tardy off,
though it make the unskilful laugh,

1187
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:52,400
cannot but make the judicious grieve;

1188
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:57,600
the censure of the which one must
in your allowance outweigh a theatre of others.

1189
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:00,200
- Mmm...
- (ALL LAUGH)

1190
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,800
Go make you ready.

1191
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:07,600
How now? Will the king hear this piece of work?

1192
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:13,400
- And the queen too, and that presently.
- Bid the players make haste!

1193
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:17,000
- Will you two help to hasten them?
- We will.

1194
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:19,200
What ho, Horatio.

1195
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:21,800
Here, sweet lord, at your service.

1196
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Horatio?

1197
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:30,200
Thou art e'en as just a man
as e'er my conversation coped withal.

1198
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:33,200
- My dear lord...
- Do not think I flatter.

1199
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:39,200
What advancement may I hope from thee that
no revenue hast but thy good spirits to feed thee?

1200
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:43,800
Why should the poor be flatter'd? Dost thou hear?

1201
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:49,800
Since my dear soul was mistress
of her choice and could of men distinguish,

1202
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,800
her election hath seal'd thee for herself.

1203
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,400
For thou hast been as one,
in suffering all, that suffers nothing,

1204
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:03,000
a man that fortune's buffets and rewards
hast ta'en with equal thanks,

1205
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:08,800
and blest are those whose blood and judgment
are so well commeddled

1206
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:14,800
that they are not a pipe for fortune's fingers
to sound what stop she please.

1207
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:19,200
Give me that man that is not passion's slave,

1208
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:22,600
and I will wear him in my heart's core,

1209
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:28,200
ay, in my heart of heart...as I do thee.

1210
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:32,600
Something too much of this.

1211
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,200
There is a play tonight before the king.

1212
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:42,000
One scene of it comes near the circumstance
which I have told thee of my father's death.

1213
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:47,800
When thou seest that act afoot, even with
the very comment of thy soul observe my uncle.

1214
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:53,400
If his occulted guilt do not itself unkennel,
it is a damned ghost that we have seen,

1215
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:56,800
and my imaginations
are as foul as Vulcan's stithy.

1216
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:03,800
Well, my lord, if he steal aught whilst
this play is playing and 'scape detecting,

1217
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,400
- I will pay the theft.
- (FANFARE)

1218
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:11,000
They are coming to the play. I must be idle.

1219
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:13,400
Get you a place.

1220
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,400
Ah!

1221
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,200
- How fares our cousin Hamlet?
- Excellent, i' faith,

1222
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,400
of the chameleon's dish!

1223
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:38,200
I eat the air, promise-crammed.
You cannot feed capons so.

1224
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:44,400
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet.
These words are not mine.

1225
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:47,000
No, nor mine now.

1226
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:54,600
My lord, you played once
in the university, you say?

1227
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:58,000
That did I, my lord,
and was accounted a good actor.

1228
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:03,200
- What did you enact?
- I did enact Julius Caesar.

1229
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:07,200
I was killed in the Capitol. Brutus killed me.

1230
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:12,200
'Twas a brute part of him
to kill so capital a calf there.

1231
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:15,000
(ALL LAUGH)

1232
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:18,400
- Be the players ready?
- They stay upon your patience.

1233
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:21,800
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.

1234
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:27,000
No, good Mother, here's metal more attractive.

1235
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:30,400
- Do you mark that?
- Shall I lie in your lap?

1236
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:35,400
- No, my lord.
- I mean, my head upon your lap?

1237
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:39,600
- Ay, my lord.
- Did you think I meant country matters?

1238
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:41,800
I think nothing, my lord.

1239
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,600
A fair thought to lie between maids' legs.

1240
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:46,600
- What is, my lord?
- Nothing.

1241
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:50,800
- You are merry, my lord.
- Who, I? O God, your only jig-maker!

1242
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,600
What should a man do but be merry?

1243
01:41:53,800 --> 01:42:00,400
For look you how cheerfully my mother looks,
and my father died within these two hours.

1244
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:03,800
- Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
- So long?

1245
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:09,600
Let the devil wear black,
for I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens!

1246
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:13,400
Died two months and not forgotten yet!

1247
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:19,600
Then there's hope a great man's memory
may outlive his life half a year.

1248
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:23,000
(MERRY CHAMBER MUSIC)

1249
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:45,800
(SINISTER MUSIC)

1250
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:15,200
- What means this, my lord?
- Marry, this is miching mallecho.

1251
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:17,400
It means mischief.

1252
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:20,800
Belike this show
imports the argument of the play.

1253
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:25,600
We shall know by this fellow. The players
cannot keep counsel. They'll tell all!

1254
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:30,800
For us, and for our tragedy,
Here stooping to your clemency,

1255
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,600
We beg your hearing patiently.

1256
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:36,600
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?

1257
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:40,200
- 'Tis brief, my lord.
- As woman's love.

1258
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:44,200
Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round

1259
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:48,000
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,

1260
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:50,800
And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen

1261
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,200
About the world
have times twelve thirties been

1262
01:45:54,400 --> 01:46:00,600
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
Unite commutual in most sacred bands.

1263
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:06,600
So many journeys may the sun and moon
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!

1264
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:12,400
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,

1265
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:15,200
So far from cheer and from your former state,

1266
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:21,400
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must.

1267
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:27,200
Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too:
My operant powers their functions leave to do;

1268
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:30,600
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,

1269
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:34,000
Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind

1270
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:37,800
- For husband shalt thou...
- O, confound the rest!

1271
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:41,400
Such love must needs be treason in my breast.

1272
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:46,600
In second husband let me be accurst!
None wed the second but who kill'd the first.

1273
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,400
Wormwood! Wormwoo...!

1274
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:54,600
The instances that second marriage move
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.

1275
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:59,800
A second time I kill my husband dead,
When second husband kisses me in bed.

1276
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:05,000
I do believe you think what now you speak,
But what we do determine oft we break.

1277
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:11,000
Purpose is but the slave to memory,
Of violent birth, but poor validity.

1278
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:14,800
So think thou wilt no second husband wed,

1279
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:18,400
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.

1280
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:22,200
Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,

1281
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:25,200
Sport and repose lock from me day and night,

1282
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:28,400
To desperation turn my trust and hope,

1283
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:31,400
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,

1284
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:36,800
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
Meet what I would have well and it destroy,

1285
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:42,200
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
lf, once a widow, ever I be wife.

1286
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:46,600
- If she should break it now.
- 'Tis deeply sworn.

1287
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,800
Sweet, leave me here awhile.

1288
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,600
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile

1289
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:01,400
The tedious day with sleep.

1290
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,800
Sleep rock thy brain,

1291
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,600
And never come mischance between us twain!

1292
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Madam, how like you this play?

1293
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:25,200
The lady doth protest too much, methinks.

1294
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:28,400
O, but she'll keep her word.

1295
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:30,600
Have you heard the argument?

1296
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:37,000
- Is there no offence in 't?
- No, they do but jest, poison in jest.

1297
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:39,200
What do you call the play?

1298
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:42,600
"The Mousetrap", marry, how tropically.

1299
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:48,000
It is the image of a murder done in Vienna.
Gonzago is the duke, his wife Baptista.

1300
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:52,400
You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish
piece of work, but what o' that?

1301
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:56,400
Your Majesty and we
that have free souls, it touches us not.

1302
01:48:56,600 --> 01:49:01,600
Let the galled jade wince,
our withers are unwrung.

1303
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:05,400
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.

1304
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:07,800
Begin, murderer.

1305
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:12,800
Pox, leave your damnable faces and begin!

1306
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:18,200
Come. The croaking raven
doth bellow for revenge.

1307
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:23,600
Thoughts black, hands apt,
drugs fit, and time agreeing,

1308
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:27,000
Confederate season, else no creature seeing,

1309
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:30,600
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,

1310
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:35,000
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,

1311
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:41,400
Thy natural magic and dire property,
On wholesome life usurps immediately.

1312
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:43,600
(WAILS)

1313
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:47,200
He poisons him in the garden for his estate!

1314
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:50,600
His name's Gonzago. The story is extant.

1315
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:55,600
You shall see anon how the murderer
gets the love of Gonzago's wife.

1316
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:59,000
- The king rises.
- What, frighted with false fire?

1317
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:02,800
- How fares my lord?
- Give o'er the play.

1318
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,600
Give me some light.

1319
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:28,600
- Away!
- Lights, lights, lights!

1320
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,600
(HAMLET LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

1321
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:39,800
(HAMLET) # Why, let the stricken deer go weep

1322
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,800
# The hart ungalled play

1323
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:46,400
# For some must watch, while some must sleep

1324
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:50,200
# Thus runs the world away #

1325
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:54,600
O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word
for a thousand pound.

1326
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:57,200
- Didst perceive?
- Very well, my lord.

1327
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:01,000
- Upon the talk of the poisoning?
- I did very well note him.

1328
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:06,000
Ha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!

1329
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:11,600
# For if the king like not the comedy,
Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdie #

1330
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:14,800
- Come, some music!
- My lord, vouchsafe me a word.

1331
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,800
- Sir, a whole history.
- The king...

1332
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:21,000
- Ay, sir, what of him?
- ..is in his retirement distempered.

1333
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,600
- With drink, sir?
- Rather with choler.

1334
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:26,200
Signify this to his doctor.

1335
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:30,400
For me to put him to his purgation
would plunge him into far more choler.

1336
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:36,400
Good my lord, put your discourse into some
frame and start not so wildly from my affair.

1337
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,800
I am tame, sir. Pronounce.

1338
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:47,000
The queen, your mother, in most great
affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.

1339
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,200
- You are welcome.
- This courtesy is not of the right breed.

1340
01:51:54,400 --> 01:52:00,800
If it shall please you to make me a wholesome
answer, I will do your mother's commandment.

1341
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,200
Sir, I cannot.

1342
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:08,400
- What, my lord?
- Make you a wholesome answer.

1343
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:13,600
My wit's diseased. But, sir, such answer
as I can make, you shall command -

1344
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:18,400
or, rather, as you say, my mother.
No more, but to the matter.

1345
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:23,600
Then thus she says - your behaviour hath
struck her into amazement and admiration.

1346
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:27,600
O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother!

1347
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:32,000
Is there no sequel at the heels
of this mother's admiration? lmpart.

1348
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
She desires to speak with you in her closet,
ere you go to bed.

1349
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,600
We shall obey were she ten times our mother.

1350
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:43,000
Have you any further trade with us?

1351
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:45,600
My lord, you once did love me.

1352
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:49,800
And do still, by these pickers and stealers.

1353
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:54,600
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper?

1354
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:59,800
You do surely bar the door upon your own liberty
if you deny your griefs to your friend.

1355
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,600
Sir...l lack advancement.

1356
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:09,400
How can that be? You have the voice
of the king himself for your succession.

1357
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:15,400
Ay, but while the grass grows...
The proverb is something musty.

1358
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:19,200
Ah, the recorders! Let me see one.

1359
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:28,000
To withdraw with you, why do you go about
as if you would drive me into a toil?

1360
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:33,000
O, my lord, if my duty be too bold,
my love is too unmannerly.

1361
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:37,600
I do not well understand that.
Will you play upon this pipe?

1362
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:41,600
- My lord, I cannot.
- I do beseech you.

1363
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:45,400
- I know no touch of it.
- It is as easy as lying.

1364
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:50,800
Govern these ventages, give it breath,
and it will discourse most eloquent music.

1365
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:55,000
- Look you, these are the stops.
- But these cannot I command.

1366
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:59,800
- (ANGRILY) I have not the skill!
- How unworthy a thing you make of me.

1367
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:05,200
You would play upon me,
you would seem to know my stops,

1368
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:08,400
you would sound me to the top of my compass.

1369
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:15,000
There is much music in this little organ,
yet cannot you make it speak.

1370
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:20,200
'Sblood, do you think I am easier
to be played on than a pipe?

1371
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:25,600
Call me what instrument you will, though
you can fret me, yet you cannot play upon me!

1372
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:30,000
- God bless you, sir.
- My lord, the queen would speak with you.

1373
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:34,600
Do you see yonder cloud
that's almost in shape of a camel?

1374
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:40,400
- By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
- Methinks it's like a weasel.

1375
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:43,800
- It is backed like a weasel.
- Or a whale.

1376
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,200
- Very like a whale.
- They fool me to the top of my bent.

1377
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:50,400
I will come by and by.

1378
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:54,400
- I will say so.
- "By and by" is easily said.

1379
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:04,200
Leave me...friends.

1380
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:24,600
'Tis now the very witching time of night,

1381
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:28,000
when churchyards yawn

1382
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:33,200
and hell itself breathes out
contagion to this world.

1383
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:43,600
Now...could I drink...hot blood,

1384
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:53,000
and do such bitter business
as the day would quake to look upon.

1385
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:57,200
Soft...now to my mother.

1386
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,800
O heart, lose not thy nature.

1387
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:05,600
Let not the soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.

1388
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:12,200
Let me be cruel, not unnatural.
I will speak daggers to her, but use none.

1389
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:15,600
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites.

1390
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:20,600
How in my words soever she be shent,

1391
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:26,800
to give them seals never my soul consent!

1392
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:37,800
I like him not!

1393
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:44,200
Nor stands it safe with us
to let his madness range.

1394
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:52,600
Therefore I your commission will dispatch,
and he to England shall along with you.

1395
01:56:54,400 --> 01:57:01,200
The terms of our estate may not endure hazard
so near as doth hourly grow out of his brows.

1396
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:06,400
We will ourselves provide.

1397
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:09,200
Most holy and religious fear it is

1398
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:14,200
to keep those many many bodies safe
that live and feed upon Your Majesty.

1399
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:20,800
The cease of majesty dies not alone,
but like a gulf doth draw what's near it with it.

1400
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:29,000
It is a massy wheel to whose huge spokes
ten thousand lesser things are adjoin'd,

1401
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:32,000
which, when it falls, each small annexment,

1402
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:36,400
petty consequence, attends the boist'rous ruin.

1403
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:40,800
Never alone did the king sigh,
but with a general groan.

1404
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:46,600
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage,

1405
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:51,400
for we will fetters put about this fear,
which now goes too free-footed.

1406
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:54,000
We will haste us.

1407
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:03,600
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.

1408
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:07,200
Behind the arras,
I'll convey myself to hear the process.

1409
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:09,600
Fare you well, my liege.

1410
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:14,800
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
and tell you what I know.

1411
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Thanks, good my lord. (SPLUTTERS)

1412
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:26,800
O, my offence is rank.

1413
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:30,200
It smells to heaven.

1414
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:38,200
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't -
a brother's murder.

1415
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Pray can I not,
though inclination be as sharp as will,

1416
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:47,800
my guilt defeats my intent,
and, like to double business bound,

1417
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:52,600
I stand in pause
where I should first begin, and both neglect.

1418
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:55,200
This cursed hand, thick with brother's blood,

1419
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:59,600
is there not rain enough in heaven
to wash it white as snow?

1420
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:03,000
Whereto serves mercy
but to confront the visage of offence?

1421
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:08,600
What's in prayer but this two-fold force,
to be forestalled ere we fall or pardon'd?

1422
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:12,800
Then I'll look up. My fault is past.

1423
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:17,600
But, O, what form of prayer can serve my turn?

1424
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:22,000
"Forgive me my foul murder"? That cannot be,

1425
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:30,000
since I am still possess'd of its effects -
my crown, mine own ambition and...my queen.

1426
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:34,800
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?

1427
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:39,800
In the corrupted currents of this world
offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,

1428
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:44,600
and oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
buys out the law.

1429
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:47,800
But 'tis not so above.

1430
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:52,600
There the action lies in his true nature,
and we ourselves compell'd

1431
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:57,000
even in the teeth and forehead
of our faults to give in evidence.

1432
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,400
What then?

1433
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:02,000
What rests?

1434
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:05,200
Try what repentance can. What can it not?

1435
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:09,800
Yet what can it when one can not repent?

1436
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,200
O wretched state!

1437
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:19,200
O bosom black as death!

1438
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:25,000
O limed soul, that,
struggling to be free, art more engaged.

1439
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:33,000
Help...angels!

1440
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:39,000
Make assay! Bow, stubborn knees...

1441
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:50,200
..and, heart with strings of steel

1442
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:53,400
be soft as sinews of the newborn babe.

1443
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:05,200
All may be well.

1444
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:10,400
(MOUTHS SILENTLY)

1445
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:15,800
Now might I do it...pat.

1446
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:22,000
Now he is praying, and now I'll do't.

1447
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:28,800
And so he goes to heaven,

1448
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
and so am I revenged.

1449
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:38,400
That would be scann'd - a villain kills my father,

1450
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:44,400
and for that, I, his sole son,
do this same villain send to heaven.

1451
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:48,400
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.

1452
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:53,800
He took my father grossly, full of bread,

1453
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:58,600
with all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May.

1454
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:05,600
Am I then revenged to take him in the purging
of his soul, when he is season'd for his passage?

1455
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:13,600
No. Up, sword, and know thou
a more horrid hent, when he is drunk asleep,

1456
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:17,600
or in his rage,
or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed,

1457
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:23,000
at game a-swearing, or about some act
that hath no relish of salvation in't,

1458
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:28,200
then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,

1459
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:34,600
and his soul may be as damn'd
and black as hell whereto it goes.

1460
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:37,800
My mother stays.

1461
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:43,800
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.

1462
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:55,800
My words fly up.

1463
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,200
My thoughts remain below.

1464
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:06,800
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.

1465
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:26,000
A will come straight. Tell him his pranks
have been too broad to bear with,

1466
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:29,600
and that Your Grace
hath stood between much heat and him.

1467
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:32,800
I'll silence me even here. Be round with him.

1468
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,800
- (HAMLET) Mother!
- I'll warrant you, fear me not.

1469
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,600
- Withdraw, I hear him coming.
- Mother?

1470
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:46,000
Now...Mother,

1471
02:03:46,200 --> 02:03:48,400
what's the matter?

1472
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:51,800
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.

1473
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Mother, you have my father much offended.

1474
02:03:55,200 --> 02:03:57,600
You answer with an idle tongue.

1475
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:01,200
- You question with a wicked tongue.
- How now, Hamlet!

1476
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:04,000
- What's the matter now?
- Hast thou forgot me?

1477
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:08,600
Not so. You are the queen,
your husband's brother's wife.

1478
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:16,400
And, would it were not so, you are my mother.

1479
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:19,800
Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.

1480
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:25,800
Sit you down. You go not till I set you up
a glass where you see the inmost part of you.

1481
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:30,000
What wilt thou do?
Thou wilt not murder me? Help! Help, ho!

1482
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:32,800
- (POLONIUS) Help! Help!
- How now! A rat?

1483
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:35,400
Dead for a ducat! Dead!

1484
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:37,800
(POLONIUS) I am slain!

1485
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,800
- What hast thou done?
- I know not. Is it the king?

1486
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:45,400
- What a rash and bloody deed is this!
- A bloody deed?

1487
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:49,400
Almost as bad as kill a king
and marry with his brother.

1488
02:04:49,600 --> 02:04:53,600
- As kill a king?
- Ay, lady, 'twas my word.

1489
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool!

1490
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:06,800
Farewell.

1491
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:12,000
I took thee for thy better.

1492
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:14,200
Take thy fortune.

1493
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.

1494
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:24,400
Leave wringing of your hands. Peace!

1495
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:31,400
Sit you down, and let me wring your heart,
for so I shall if it be made of penetrable stuff,

1496
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:36,000
if damned custom have not brass'd it
so that it is proof against sense.

1497
02:05:36,200 --> 02:05:39,800
What have I done
that thou darest wag thy tongue so?

1498
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,400
Such an act that blurs the grace of modesty,

1499
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:48,200
calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
from the forehead of an innocent love

1500
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:53,000
and sets a blister there,
makes marriage-vows as false as dicers' oaths!

1501
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:57,400
Ay me, what act that roars so loud
and thunders in the index?

1502
02:05:57,600 --> 02:06:05,200
Look here upon this picture, and on this,
the counterfeit presentment of two brothers.

1503
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:12,000
See, what a grace was seated on this brow -
Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself,

1504
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:16,000
an eye like Mars to threaten and command,

1505
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,800
a station like the herald Mercury
new-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill,

1506
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:27,600
a combination and a form indeed
where every god did seem to set his seal

1507
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:30,800
to give the world assurance of a man.

1508
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,200
This was your husband.

1509
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:39,000
Look you now what follows.

1510
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:43,200
Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
blasting his wholesome brother.

1511
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:49,400
Have you eyes? Could you on this fair mountain
leave to feed and batten on this moor?

1512
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:53,200
Have you eyes? You cannot call it love,

1513
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:58,000
for at your age the blood is tame
and waits upon the judgment,

1514
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:01,400
and what judgment would step from this to this?

1515
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:04,600
Sense you have, else could you not have motion,

1516
02:07:04,600 --> 02:07:08,000
but that sense is apoplex'd,
for madness would not err

1517
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:10,800
nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd

1518
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:15,000
but it reserved some quantity of choice
to serve in such a difference.

1519
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:18,400
What devil was't that thus hath cozen'd you
at hoodman-blind?

1520
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:20,600
O shame, where is thy blush?

1521
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:24,400
Rebellious hell,
if thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,

1522
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:28,800
to flaming youth let virtue be as wax
and melt in its own fire.

1523
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:33,400
Proclaim no shame
when the compulsive ardour gives the charge,

1524
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:38,400
since frost itself as actively doth burn
and reason panders will.

1525
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:40,600
O Hamlet, speak no more!

1526
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:43,800
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,

1527
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:48,400
and there I see such black spots
as will not leave their tinct.

1528
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:55,400
Nay, but to live in the rank sweat
of an enseamed bed, stew'd in corruption,

1529
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:58,600
honeying, making love over the nasty sty!

1530
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:01,000
O, Hamlet, speak no more!

1531
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:05,600
These words like daggers enter in mine ear!
No more, sweet Hamlet!

1532
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:10,800
A murderer and a villain, a slave that is not
twentieth part the tithe of your precedent lord!

1533
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:15,200
A vice of kings,
a cutpurse of the empire and the rule,

1534
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:20,000
that from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
and put it in his pocket!

1535
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:23,000
A king of shreds and patches!

1536
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:34,800
Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,
you heavenly guards!

1537
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,400
What would your gracious figure?

1538
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:40,200
Alas...he's mad.

1539
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:43,600
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,

1540
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:52,000
that, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
the important acting of your dread command?

1541
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:55,000
- O, say!
- Do not forget.

1542
02:08:55,200 --> 02:08:59,000
This visitation is but to whet
thy almost blunted purpose.

1543
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:04,000
But, look...

1544
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,200
amazement on thy mother sits.

1545
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:15,600
O, step between her and her fighting soul.
Speak to her, Hamlet.

1546
02:09:17,200 --> 02:09:20,400
How is it with you, lady?

1547
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:25,200
Alas, how is't with you,

1548
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:31,600
that you do bend your eye on vacancy
and with the incorporal air do hold discourse?

1549
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:35,000
- Whereon do you look?
- On him.

1550
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:38,800
On him! Look you, how pale he glares!

1551
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:44,000
His form and cause conjoin'd,
preaching to stones, would make them capable.

1552
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Do not look upon me, lest with this piteous
action you convert my stern effects.

1553
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:55,600
Then what I have to do will want true colour -
tears perchance for blood.

1554
02:09:56,600 --> 02:10:00,000
To whom do you speak this?

1555
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:03,800
Do you see nothing there?

1556
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Nothing at all, yet all that is I see.

1557
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:10,400
Nor did you nothing hear?

1558
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:13,200
No, nothing but ourselves.

1559
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:16,600
Why, look you there!

1560
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:19,200
Look how it steals away!

1561
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:24,800
My father, in his habit as he liv'd!

1562
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:28,400
Look where he goes even now out at the portal!

1563
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:35,800
This is the very coinage of your brain.
This bodiless creation ecstasy is very cunning in.

1564
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:47,800
Ecstasy? My pulse,
as yours, doth temperately keep time,

1565
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:51,000
and makes as healthful music.

1566
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:55,600
It is not madness that I have utter'd.

1567
02:10:55,600 --> 02:11:02,400
Bring me to the test, and I the matter
will re-word, which madness would gambol from.

1568
02:11:02,400 --> 02:11:09,400
Mother, for love of grace,
lay not that flattering unction to your soul,

1569
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:13,200
that not your trespass,
but my madness speaks.

1570
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:16,800
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,

1571
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:22,000
whilst rank corruption,
mining all within, infects unseen.

1572
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:27,600
Confess yourself to heaven, repent what's past,

1573
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:35,200
avoid what is to come, and do not spread
the compost on the weeds to make them ranker.

1574
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:40,400
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

1575
02:11:42,200 --> 02:11:49,800
O, throw away the worser part of it,
and live the purer with the other half.

1576
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:55,600
Good night, but go not to mine uncle's bed.

1577
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:05,200
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.

1578
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:12,000
Refrain tonight, and that shall lend
a kind of easiness to the next abstinence,

1579
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:14,600
the next more easy.

1580
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,600
Once more, good night,

1581
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:26,600
and when you are desirous to be bless'd,
I'll blessing beg of you.

1582
02:12:31,200 --> 02:12:37,600
For this same lord, I do repent,
but heaven hath pleased it so

1583
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:44,600
to punish me with this and this with me
that I must be their scourge and minister.

1584
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:49,800
I will bestow him,
and will answer well the death I gave him.

1585
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:55,800
So, again, good night.
I must be cruel only to be kind.

1586
02:12:57,200 --> 02:13:00,600
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.

1587
02:13:10,200 --> 02:13:12,800
One word more, good lady.

1588
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,200
What shall I do?

1589
02:13:15,400 --> 02:13:19,200
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do -

1590
02:13:19,200 --> 02:13:24,000
let the bloat king tempt you again to bed,
pinch wanton on your cheek,

1591
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:29,400
call you his mouse, and let him,
for a pair of reechy kisses

1592
02:13:29,600 --> 02:13:32,800
or paddling in your neck
with his damn'd fingers,

1593
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:36,600
make you to ravel all this matter out,

1594
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:44,000
that I...essentially...am not in madness,

1595
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:49,000
but mad in craft.

1596
02:13:49,200 --> 02:13:51,400
'Twere good you let him know.

1597
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:57,800
Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
and breath of life,

1598
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:02,400
I have no life
to breathe what thou hast said to me.

1599
02:14:03,400 --> 02:14:07,000
I must to England, you know that?

1600
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:10,800
Alack, I had forgot. 'Tis so concluded on?

1601
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:14,400
There's letters seal'd, and my two schoolfellows,

1602
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:19,800
whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
they bear the mandate.

1603
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:23,800
They must sweep my way
and marshal me to knavery.

1604
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:33,800
Let it work. For 'tis the sport to have
the engineer hoist with his own petard,

1605
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:39,800
and it shall go hard
but I will delve one yard below their mines

1606
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:43,200
and blow them at the moon.

1607
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:52,400
O, 'tis most sweet when in one line
two crafts directly meet.

1608
02:14:54,200 --> 02:14:59,800
This man shall set me packing,
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.

1609
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:03,800
Mother, good night.

1610
02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:13,400
Indeed this counsellor is now most still,
most secret and most grave,

1611
02:15:13,400 --> 02:15:18,200
who was in life a foolish...

1612
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,000
..(SOBS) prating knave.

1613
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:28,600
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.

1614
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,200
Good night, Mother.

1615
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:42,600
There's matter in these sighs,
these profound heaves, you must translate.

1616
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:45,000
'Tis fit we understand them.

1617
02:15:45,200 --> 02:15:47,400
Where is your son?

1618
02:15:53,200 --> 02:15:56,600
Bestow this place on us a little while.

1619
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:05,600
O, my own lord, what have I seen tonight.

1620
02:16:05,800 --> 02:16:08,600
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?

1621
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:17,400
Mad...as the sea and wind
when both contend which is the mightier.

1622
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:24,400
In his lawless fit,
behind the arras hearing something stir,

1623
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:30,400
whips out his rapier, cries, "A rat! A rat!"

1624
02:16:30,600 --> 02:16:37,800
and in this brainish apprehension
kills the unseen good old man.

1625
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:53,200
O heavy deed!

1626
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:03,200
It had been so with us, had we been there.

1627
02:17:04,400 --> 02:17:11,000
His liberty is full of threats to all -
to you yourself, to us, to everyone.

1628
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:15,600
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?

1629
02:17:15,800 --> 02:17:20,400
It will be laid to us, whose providence
should have kept short, restrain'd

1630
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:23,600
and out of haunt this mad young man,

1631
02:17:23,600 --> 02:17:28,600
but so much was our love
that like the owner of a foul disease,

1632
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:33,400
to keep it from divulging,
let it feed even on the pith of life.

1633
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:39,200
- Where is he gone?
- To draw apart the body he hath kill'd,

1634
02:17:39,400 --> 02:17:42,000
o'er whom his very madness, like some ore

1635
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:47,400
among a mineral of metals base shows itself
pure - he weeps for what is done.

1636
02:17:47,600 --> 02:17:49,800
O Gertrude, come away!

1637
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:56,400
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
but we will ship him hence.

1638
02:17:57,800 --> 02:18:03,600
This vile deed we must with all our majesty
and skill both countenance and excuse.

1639
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:06,800
Ho, Guildenstern!

1640
02:18:09,600 --> 02:18:12,800
Friends both, go join you with some further aid.

1641
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:17,200
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain
and from this closet dragg'd him.

1642
02:18:17,400 --> 02:18:22,200
Go seek him out - speak fair -
and bring the body into the chapel.

1643
02:18:26,400 --> 02:18:30,000
Gertrude, come away.

1644
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:35,200
My soul is full of discord and dismay.

1645
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:38,400
Safely stowed.

1646
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:42,200
(GUILDENSTERN) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!

1647
02:18:42,200 --> 02:18:45,800
Soft, what noise?
(CALLS OUT) Who calls on Hamlet?

1648
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:51,400
O, here they come.

1649
02:18:57,400 --> 02:19:02,200
- What have you done with the dead body?
- Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.

1650
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:05,600
Tell us where 'tis
that we may bear it to the chapel.

1651
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:09,200
- Do not believe it.
- Believe what?

1652
02:19:09,400 --> 02:19:14,200
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
To be demanded of a sponge -

1653
02:19:14,400 --> 02:19:18,400
what replication should be made
by the son of a king?

1654
02:19:18,600 --> 02:19:21,200
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?

1655
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:25,000
Ay, sir, that soaks up
the king's countenance, rewards, authorities.

1656
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:28,000
But such officers do the king best service,

1657
02:19:28,200 --> 02:19:33,800
he keeps them, like an ape, in his jaw -
first mouthed, to be last swallowed.

1658
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:39,200
When he needs what you have gleaned,
it is but squeezing you,

1659
02:19:39,400 --> 02:19:43,400
and, sponge, you shall be dry again.

1660
02:19:44,400 --> 02:19:48,000
- I understand you not, my lord.
- I am glad of it.

1661
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:54,200
- A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
- My lord, tell us where the body is.

1662
02:19:54,400 --> 02:19:58,800
The body is with the king,
but the king is not with the body.

1663
02:19:59,400 --> 02:20:02,600
- The king is a thing.
- A thing, my lord?

1664
02:20:03,800 --> 02:20:06,000
Of nothing.

1665
02:20:08,600 --> 02:20:11,200
Bring me to him.

1666
02:20:11,800 --> 02:20:14,600
Hide fox, and all after!

1667
02:20:18,400 --> 02:20:21,800
I have sent to seek him and to find the body.

1668
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:25,000
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose.

1669
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:28,200
Yet he's loved of the distracted multitude,

1670
02:20:28,400 --> 02:20:31,400
who like not in their judgment but their eyes,

1671
02:20:31,600 --> 02:20:35,600
and where 'tis so, the scourge is weigh'd,
but never the offence.

1672
02:20:35,800 --> 02:20:41,800
To bear all smooth and even, this sudden
sending him away must seem deliberate pause.

1673
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:46,400
Diseases desperate grown by desperate
appliance are relieved, or not at all.

1674
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:48,000
How now?

1675
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:50,600
Where the body's bestow'd
we cannot get from him.

1676
02:20:50,800 --> 02:20:53,600
- But where is he?
- Without, my lord. Guarded.

1677
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:59,000
- Bring him before us.
- Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in the lord.

1678
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:09,600
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?

1679
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
- At supper.
- At supper? Where?

1680
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:15,200
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.

1681
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:19,800
A certain convocation
of politic worms are e'en at him.

1682
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,200
Your worm is emperor for diet.

1683
02:21:22,400 --> 02:21:26,200
We fat all creatures to fat us,
and ourselves for maggots.

1684
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:30,200
Your fat king and your lean beggar
is but variable service -

1685
02:21:30,400 --> 02:21:32,600
two dishes, but to one table.

1686
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:35,000
- That's the end.
- Alas. Alas.

1687
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:38,400
A man may fish
with the worm that hath eat of a king,

1688
02:21:38,600 --> 02:21:42,000
and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.

1689
02:21:42,200 --> 02:21:44,400
What dost thou mean by this?

1690
02:21:44,400 --> 02:21:49,800
Nothing but to show you how a king may
go a progress through the guts of a beggar.

1691
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:57,400
- Where's Polonius?
- In heaven. Send thither to see.

1692
02:21:57,600 --> 02:22:02,600
If your messenger find him not there,
seek him in the other place yourself.

1693
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:09,400
But if you find him not within this month,
you shall nose him as you go into the lobby.

1694
02:22:09,800 --> 02:22:11,600
Go seek him there.

1695
02:22:12,800 --> 02:22:15,800
He will stay till you come.

1696
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:22,400
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety -
which we do tender,

1697
02:22:22,600 --> 02:22:27,800
as we grieve for that which thou hast done -
must send thee hence with fiery quickness.

1698
02:22:27,800 --> 02:22:32,800
Prepare thyself. The bark is ready,
the wind at help, everything is bent for England.

1699
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:34,800
- For England?
- Ay, Hamlet.

1700
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:38,800
- Good.
- So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.

1701
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,800
I see a cherub that sees them.

1702
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
But, come, for England.

1703
02:22:44,200 --> 02:22:46,000
Farewell, dear Mother.

1704
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:50,200
- Thy loving father, Hamlet.
- My mother.

1705
02:22:50,200 --> 02:22:58,000
Father and mother is man and wife,
man and wife is one flesh...so my mother.

1706
02:22:59,800 --> 02:23:02,000
Come.

1707
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:05,200
- For England!
- Follow him at foot.

1708
02:23:05,400 --> 02:23:10,400
Tempt him with speed aboard.
Delay it not. I'll have him hence tonight.

1709
02:23:21,400 --> 02:23:23,200
And, England,

1710
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:28,400
if my love thou hold'st at aught,
thou mayst not coldly set our sovereign process,

1711
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:33,200
which imports at full,
by letters congruing to that effect,

1712
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:35,000
the present death of Hamlet.

1713
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:41,200
Do it, England. For like the hectic
in my blood he rages, and thou must cure me.

1714
02:23:42,200 --> 02:23:48,400
Till I know 'tis done, howe'er my haps,
my joys were ne'er begun.

1715
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:56,000
Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.

1716
02:23:56,200 --> 02:23:59,600
Tell him that, by his licence,
Fortinbras craves the conveyance

1717
02:23:59,800 --> 02:24:02,200
of a promised march over his kingdom.

1718
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:04,600
You know the rendezvous.

1719
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:10,000
If that His Majesty would aught of us,
we shall express our duty in his eye.

1720
02:24:10,200 --> 02:24:13,200
- Let him know so.
- I will do't, my lord.

1721
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:19,600
Go softly on.

1722
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:33,000
- Good sir, whose powers are these?
- They are of Norway, sir.

1723
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:36,000
- How purposed, sir?
- Against some part of Poland.

1724
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:40,000
- Who commands them, sir?
- The nephew of old Norway, Fortinbras.

1725
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:42,800
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir?

1726
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:48,600
Truly, we go to gain a patch of ground
that hath in it no profit but the name.

1727
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:53,200
- I would not farm it.
- Then the Polack never will defend it.

1728
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:56,200
Yes, it is already garrison'd.

1729
02:24:58,200 --> 02:25:00,400
I humbly thank you, sir.

1730
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,400
Will't please you go, my lord?

1731
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:10,200
I'll be with you straight go a little before.

1732
02:25:18,200 --> 02:25:25,200
How all occasions do inform against me
and spur my dull revenge.

1733
02:25:27,400 --> 02:25:34,800
What is a man if his chief good and market
of his time be but to sleep and feed?

1734
02:25:34,800 --> 02:25:37,400
A beast, no more.

1735
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:42,600
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
looking before and after,

1736
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:48,600
gave us not that capability
and godlike reason to fust in us unused.

1737
02:25:50,400 --> 02:25:54,000
Now, whether it be bestial oblivion,

1738
02:25:54,200 --> 02:25:59,200
or some craven scruple
of thinking too precisely on the event,

1739
02:25:59,400 --> 02:26:01,800
I do not know why

1740
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:06,800
yet I live to say this thing's to do.

1741
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:13,800
Sith I have cause, and will,
and strength, and means to do it.

1742
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:22,400
Examples gross as earth exhort me.
Witness this army of such mass and charge

1743
02:26:22,600 --> 02:26:28,400
led by a delicate and tender prince,
whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd

1744
02:26:28,600 --> 02:26:31,600
makes mouths at the invisible event,

1745
02:26:31,800 --> 02:26:38,400
exposing what is mortal and unsure
to all that fortune, death and danger dare...

1746
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:43,600
..even for an egg-shell.

1747
02:26:44,200 --> 02:26:50,800
Rightly to be great
is not to stir without great argument,

1748
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:57,200
but greatly to find quarrel in a straw
when honour's at the stake.

1749
02:26:58,400 --> 02:27:04,000
How stand I then,
that have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,

1750
02:27:04,200 --> 02:27:08,000
excitements of my reason
and my blood, and let all sleep?

1751
02:27:08,200 --> 02:27:14,800
While, to my shame, I see the imminent death
of twenty thousand men

1752
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:20,200
that, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
go to their graves like beds,

1753
02:27:20,400 --> 02:27:24,600
fight for a plot
whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,

1754
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:29,600
which is not tomb enough
and continent to hide the slain?

1755
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:35,200
O, from this time forth,

1756
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:40,600
my thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth.

1757
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:04,200
I will not speak with her.

1758
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:10,400
She is importunate, indeed distract.
Her mood will needs be pitied.

1759
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:16,000
- What would she have?
- She speaks much of her father,

1760
02:28:16,200 --> 02:28:20,800
says she hears there's tricks i' the world,
and hems, and beats her heart,

1761
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:26,600
spurns enviously at straws, speaks things
in doubt that carry but half sense.

1762
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:32,600
Her speech is nothing, yet the unshaped use
of it doth move her hearers to collection.

1763
02:28:32,800 --> 02:28:36,600
They botch the words up fit to their own thoughts,

1764
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:41,200
which, as her gestures yield them,
make one think there might be thought,

1765
02:28:41,400 --> 02:28:43,800
though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.

1766
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,400
It were good she were spoken with,

1767
02:28:46,600 --> 02:28:51,000
for she may strew dangerous conjectures
in ill-breeding minds.

1768
02:28:51,400 --> 02:28:53,400
Let her come in.

1769
02:28:56,400 --> 02:29:01,400
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,

1770
02:29:03,400 --> 02:29:06,600
each toy seems prologue to some great amiss.

1771
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:15,200
So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
it spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

1772
02:29:23,800 --> 02:29:27,000
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?

1773
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:31,000
How now...Ophelia?

1774
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:40,200
# How should I your true love know

1775
02:29:40,400 --> 02:29:42,400
# From another one?

1776
02:29:42,600 --> 02:29:45,200
# By his cockle hat and staff

1777
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:47,400
# And his sandal shoon #

1778
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:50,200
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?

1779
02:29:50,400 --> 02:29:52,600
Say you? Nay, pray you, mark.

1780
02:29:52,800 --> 02:29:55,000
# He is dead and gone, lady

1781
02:29:55,200 --> 02:29:57,000
# He is dead and gone

1782
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,600
# At his head a grass-green turf

1783
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:01,400
# At his heels a stone #

1784
02:30:01,600 --> 02:30:04,200
- Nay, but Ophelia...
- Pray you, mark.

1785
02:30:04,400 --> 02:30:06,600
# White his shroud as the mountain snow

1786
02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:08,600
# Larded with sweet flowers

1787
02:30:08,800 --> 02:30:11,800
# Which bewept to the grave did not go

1788
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:15,400
- # With true-love showers #
- How do you, pretty lady?

1789
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,800
Well, God dild you!

1790
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:24,400
They say the owl was a baker's daughter.

1791
02:30:24,600 --> 02:30:29,600
Lord, we know what we are,
but know not what we may be.

1792
02:30:29,800 --> 02:30:32,800
- God be at your table.
- Conceit upon her father.

1793
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,200
Pray, let's have no words of this,

1794
02:30:35,400 --> 02:30:39,600
but when they ask you what it means,
say you this...

1795
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:45,600
# Tomorrow is Saint Valentine's Day,
all in the morning betime

1796
02:30:45,800 --> 02:30:50,400
# And I a maid at your window
to be your Valentine

1797
02:30:50,800 --> 02:30:55,400
# Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,
and dupp'd the chamber-door

1798
02:30:55,600 --> 02:31:00,600
# Let in a maid, that out a maid
never departed more #

1799
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:04,000
- Pretty Ophelia...
- Without an oath, I'll make an end on't.

1800
02:31:04,200 --> 02:31:08,200
# By Gis and by Saint Charity,
alack and fie for shame

1801
02:31:08,400 --> 02:31:12,800
# Young men will do't if they come to't -
by Cock, they are to blame

1802
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:19,200
# Quoth she, "Before you tumbled me,
you promised me to wed"

1803
02:31:19,400 --> 02:31:23,600
He answers -
# "So would I ha' done, by yonder sun

1804
02:31:23,800 --> 02:31:26,400
# And thou hadst not come to my bed #

1805
02:31:26,600 --> 02:31:30,600
- How long hath she been thus?
- I hope all will be well.

1806
02:31:30,800 --> 02:31:35,400
We must be patient,
but I cannot choose but weep

1807
02:31:35,600 --> 02:31:39,400
to think they would lay him in the cold ground.

1808
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:41,800
My brother shall know of it!

1809
02:31:44,800 --> 02:31:48,400
And so I thank you for your good counsel.

1810
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,400
Come, my coach.

1811
02:31:51,800 --> 02:31:57,200
Good night, ladies. Good night, sweet ladies.

1812
02:31:57,400 --> 02:32:00,200
Good night.

1813
02:32:00,400 --> 02:32:02,600
Good night.

1814
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:07,400
Follow her close.
Give her good watch, I pray you.

1815
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:16,800
O, this is the poison of deep grief.
It springs all from her father's death.

1816
02:32:17,800 --> 02:32:23,000
And now behold - O Gertrude, Gertrude! -

1817
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:28,600
when sorrows come,
they come not single spies but in battalions.

1818
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:35,200
First, her father slain; next, your son gone,

1819
02:32:35,400 --> 02:32:38,600
and he most violent author
of his own just remove;

1820
02:32:38,800 --> 02:32:43,400
the people muddied, thick and unwholesome
in their whispers for good Polonius' death;

1821
02:32:43,600 --> 02:32:47,800
and we have done but greenly
in hugger-mugger to inter him;

1822
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:52,800
poor Ophelia divided
from herself and her fair judgment,

1823
02:32:52,800 --> 02:32:58,600
without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;

1824
02:33:00,400 --> 02:33:07,000
last, and as much containing as all these,
her brother is in secret come from France

1825
02:33:07,200 --> 02:33:12,600
and wants not buzzers to infect his ear with
pestilent speeches of his father's death.

1826
02:33:12,800 --> 02:33:19,000
O my dear Gertrude, this, like to
a murdering-piece, gives me superfluous death.

1827
02:33:19,200 --> 02:33:21,200
(BANGING)

1828
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:23,400
Alack, what noise is this?

1829
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:27,000
Attend! Where are my Switzers?
Let them guard the door.

1830
02:33:27,200 --> 02:33:29,400
- What's the matter?
- Save yourself, my lord.

1831
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:32,600
The ocean eats not the flats with more haste

1832
02:33:32,600 --> 02:33:36,200
than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
o'erbears your officers.

1833
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:41,600
The rabble call him lord, and, as the world
were now but to begin, custom not known,

1834
02:33:41,800 --> 02:33:44,800
they cry, "Choose we! Laertes shall be king!"

1835
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:50,000
Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it
to the clouds, "Laertes shall be king!"

1836
02:33:50,200 --> 02:33:57,000
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!

1837
02:33:57,200 --> 02:33:59,200
- (CRASH)
- The doors are broke.

1838
02:33:59,400 --> 02:34:01,600
(LAERTES) Where is this king?

1839
02:34:01,800 --> 02:34:05,600
O thou vile king! Give me my father!

1840
02:34:05,800 --> 02:34:08,200
Calmly, good Laertes.

1841
02:34:08,200 --> 02:34:11,800
That drop of blood that's calm
proclaims me bastard,

1842
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:15,600
cries cuckold to my father,
brands the harlot even here,

1843
02:34:15,800 --> 02:34:18,800
between the chaste unsmirched brow
of my true mother.

1844
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:23,600
What is the cause, Laertes,
that thy rebellion looks so giant-like?

1845
02:34:23,800 --> 02:34:26,800
Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.

1846
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,200
There's such divinity doth hedge a king

1847
02:34:29,400 --> 02:34:34,800
that treason can but peep to what it would,
acts little of his will.

1848
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,800
Tell me, Laertes, why thou art thus incensed.

1849
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:39,800
Let him go, Gertrude.

1850
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:43,600
- Speak, man.
- Where is my father?

1851
02:34:43,800 --> 02:34:45,400
- Dead.
- Not by him.

1852
02:34:45,600 --> 02:34:48,600
- Let him demand his fill.
- How came he dead?

1853
02:34:48,800 --> 02:34:52,400
I'll not be juggled with! To hell, allegiance!

1854
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:57,600
Vows, to the blackest devil!
Conscience and grace to the profoundest pit!

1855
02:34:57,800 --> 02:35:00,600
I dare damnation.

1856
02:35:00,600 --> 02:35:07,400
To this point I stand, that both the worlds
I give to negligence, let come what comes,

1857
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:11,000
only I'll be revenged most throughly for my father.

1858
02:35:11,200 --> 02:35:14,800
- Who shall stay you?
- My will, not all the world's.

1859
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:18,800
Laertes, if you desire to know
the certainty of your dear father,

1860
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:23,200
is't writ in your revenge that
you will draw both friend and foe?

1861
02:35:23,400 --> 02:35:26,800
- None but his enemies.
- Will you know them then?

1862
02:35:27,200 --> 02:35:30,200
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms,

1863
02:35:30,400 --> 02:35:34,000
and like the kind pelican
repast them with my blood.

1864
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:39,000
Why, now you speak
like a good child and a true gentleman!

1865
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:43,800
That I am guiltless of your father's death,
and am in grief for it,

1866
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:47,400
it shall as level to your judgment 'pear
as day does to your eye.

1867
02:35:47,600 --> 02:35:50,600
How now, what noise is that?

1868
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,600
O heat, dry up my brains.

1869
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:13,600
Tears seven times salt burn out the sense
and virtue of mine eye.

1870
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:22,200
By heavens, thy madness shall be paid
with weight till our scale turn the beam.

1871
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:24,400
O rose of May!

1872
02:36:26,400 --> 02:36:28,000
Dear maid,

1873
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:30,400
kind sister,

1874
02:36:30,600 --> 02:36:32,400
sweet Ophelia!

1875
02:36:33,800 --> 02:36:36,200
O heavens!

1876
02:36:36,400 --> 02:36:41,200
Is't possible, a young maid's wits
should be as mortal as an old man's life?

1877
02:36:41,400 --> 02:36:44,400
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,

1878
02:36:44,400 --> 02:36:48,800
it sends some precious instance of itself
after the thing it loves.

1879
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:52,600
# They bore him barefaced on the bier

1880
02:36:52,800 --> 02:36:56,200
# Hey non nonny nonny, hey nonny

1881
02:36:56,400 --> 02:37:01,600
# And in his grave rain'd many a tear #

1882
02:37:01,800 --> 02:37:03,800
Fare you well, my dove!

1883
02:37:05,400 --> 02:37:10,400
Hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge,
it could not move thus.

1884
02:37:11,600 --> 02:37:16,200
You must sing "a-down a-down",
and you "call him a-down-a".

1885
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,800
How the wheel becomes it!

1886
02:37:19,800 --> 02:37:23,400
It is the false steward
that stole his master's daughter.

1887
02:37:23,400 --> 02:37:25,600
This nothing's more than matter.

1888
02:37:26,600 --> 02:37:30,400
There's rosemary. That's for remembrance.

1889
02:37:30,600 --> 02:37:35,200
Pray you, love, remember.

1890
02:37:35,400 --> 02:37:37,800
There's pansies. That's for thoughts.

1891
02:37:39,400 --> 02:37:44,200
A document in madness,
thoughts and remembrance fitted.

1892
02:37:46,200 --> 02:37:49,800
There's fennel for you, and columbines.

1893
02:37:51,800 --> 02:37:57,600
Here's rue for you. And there's some for me.
We may call it herb of grace a Sundays.

1894
02:37:57,800 --> 02:38:01,000
O you must wear your rue with a difference.

1895
02:38:01,200 --> 02:38:03,000
There's a daisy.

1896
02:38:05,800 --> 02:38:11,600
I would give you some violets,
but they withered all when my father died.

1897
02:38:13,200 --> 02:38:15,600
They say he made a good end.

1898
02:38:15,800 --> 02:38:19,200
# For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy #

1899
02:38:19,400 --> 02:38:23,800
Thought and affliction, passion,

1900
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:29,400
hell itself she turns to favour and to pretti...

1901
02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:33,000
# And will he not come again?

1902
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:36,400
# And will he not come again?

1903
02:38:39,800 --> 02:38:42,400
# No, no, he is dead

1904
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,600
# Go to thy death-bed

1905
02:38:46,800 --> 02:38:49,400
# He never will come again

1906
02:38:51,800 --> 02:38:54,600
# His beard was as white as snow

1907
02:38:55,600 --> 02:38:59,200
# All flaxen was his poll

1908
02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:02,600
# He is gone, he is gone

1909
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,200
# And we cast away moan

1910
02:39:05,400 --> 02:39:08,400
# God ha' mercy on his soul #

1911
02:39:10,800 --> 02:39:15,800
And of all Christian souls, I pray God.

1912
02:39:19,800 --> 02:39:21,800
God buy you.

1913
02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:27,400
Do you see this, O God?

1914
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:29,600
Laertes...

1915
02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:35,400
I must commune with your grief,
or you deny me right.

1916
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:43,000
Go make choice of your wisest friends,
and they shall judge 'twixt you and me.

1917
02:39:43,200 --> 02:39:46,600
If by direct or by collateral hand
they find us touch'd,

1918
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:50,800
we will our kingdom give, our crown, our life,
to you in satisfaction.

1919
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:55,600
But if not, be you content
to lend your patience to us,

1920
02:39:55,800 --> 02:40:01,000
and we shall jointly labour with your soul
to give it due content.

1921
02:40:03,400 --> 02:40:05,400
Let this be so.

1922
02:40:06,200 --> 02:40:10,200
His means of death, his obscure funeral -

1923
02:40:10,200 --> 02:40:13,200
no trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,

1924
02:40:13,400 --> 02:40:17,800
no noble rite nor formal ostentation -
cry to be heard,

1925
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:23,000
as 'twere from heaven to earth,
that I must call't in question.

1926
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,400
And so you shall.

1927
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:31,000
And where the offence is let the great axe fall.

1928
02:40:47,600 --> 02:40:51,200
- God bless you, sir.
- Let him bless thee, too.

1929
02:40:51,400 --> 02:40:54,800
He shall, sir, an't please him.

1930
02:40:56,000 --> 02:41:01,200
There's a letter for you, sir. It came from
the ambassador that was bound for England...

1931
02:41:03,400 --> 02:41:08,000
if your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.

1932
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:28,800
"Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this,
give these fellows means to the king.

1933
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:33,200
"They have letters for him.
Ere we were two days old at sea,

1934
02:41:33,400 --> 02:41:36,000
"a pirate of warlike appointment gave us chase.

1935
02:41:36,200 --> 02:41:41,800
"Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put
on a compelled valour, and I boarded them.

1936
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:46,600
"On the instant they got clear of our ship,
so I alone became their prisoner.

1937
02:41:46,800 --> 02:41:53,000
"They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy.
I am to do a good turn for them.

1938
02:41:56,200 --> 02:41:59,200
"Let the king have the letters I have sent

1939
02:41:59,400 --> 02:42:03,600
"and repair to me with as much speed
as thou wouldst fly death.

1940
02:42:03,800 --> 02:42:07,000
"I have words to speak
which will make thee dumb,

1941
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:09,600
"yet are they too light for the matter.

1942
02:42:09,800 --> 02:42:12,400
"These fellows will bring thee where I am.

1943
02:42:12,600 --> 02:42:15,600
"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
hold their course for England -

1944
02:42:15,600 --> 02:42:18,400
"of them I have much to tell thee.

1945
02:42:18,600 --> 02:42:23,800
"Farewell. He that thou knowest thine, Hamlet."

1946
02:42:26,400 --> 02:42:30,400
Come, I will give you way
for these letters, and do't the speedier

1947
02:42:30,600 --> 02:42:35,200
that you may direct me to him
from whom you brought them.

1948
02:42:45,200 --> 02:42:51,200
Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
and you must put me in your heart for friend,

1949
02:42:51,400 --> 02:42:54,000
sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,

1950
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:58,000
that he which hath your noble father slain
pursu'd my life.

1951
02:42:58,200 --> 02:43:03,000
It well appears, but tell me
why you proceeded not against these feats,

1952
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:09,400
so crimeful and so capital in nature,
as by your safety and wisdom you were stirr'd up.

1953
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:14,000
O, for two special reasons,
which may to you seem much unsinew'd.

1954
02:43:14,200 --> 02:43:18,000
The queen his mother lives almost by his looks,

1955
02:43:18,200 --> 02:43:23,800
and for myself -
my virtue or my plague, be it either which -

1956
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,600
she is so conjunctive to my soul that,

1957
02:43:26,600 --> 02:43:32,000
as the star moves not but in his sphere,
I could not but by her.

1958
02:43:32,200 --> 02:43:35,400
The other motive
why to a public count I might not go

1959
02:43:35,600 --> 02:43:40,600
is the love the general gender bear him,
who, dipping all his faults in their affection,

1960
02:43:40,800 --> 02:43:45,000
work like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
convert his gyves to graces.

1961
02:43:45,200 --> 02:43:50,600
And so have I a noble father lost,
a sister driven into desperate terms,

1962
02:43:50,800 --> 02:43:57,000
whose worth stood challenger
on mount of all the age for her perfections.

1963
02:43:57,200 --> 02:44:02,800
- But my revenge will come.
- Break not your sleeps for that.

1964
02:44:02,800 --> 02:44:09,800
You must not think that we can let our beard
be shook with danger and think it pastime.

1965
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,200
You shortly shall hear more.

1966
02:44:14,200 --> 02:44:16,400
I loved your father,

1967
02:44:17,200 --> 02:44:21,400
and we love ourself, and that,
I hope, will teach you to imagine...

1968
02:44:21,600 --> 02:44:24,400
- What news?
- Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.

1969
02:44:24,600 --> 02:44:28,400
- These to Your Majesty, this to the queen.
- From Hamlet?

1970
02:44:30,600 --> 02:44:33,400
- Who brought them?
- Sailors, my lord, they say.

1971
02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:39,600
I saw them not. They were given me by Claudio.
He received them of him that brought them.

1972
02:44:41,600 --> 02:44:44,600
Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.

1973
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:52,000
"High and mighty, you shall know
I am set naked on your kingdom.

1974
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:55,800
"Tomorrow shall I beg leave
to see your kingly eyes,

1975
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:01,600
"when I shall thereunto recount the occasion
of my sudden and strange return. Hamlet."

1976
02:45:01,800 --> 02:45:03,800
What should this mean?

1977
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:08,200
Are all the rest come back
or is this some abuse and no such thing?

1978
02:45:08,400 --> 02:45:12,200
- Know you the hand?
- 'Tis Hamlet's character. "Naked"?

1979
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:17,800
And in a postscript, he says "alone".
Can you devise me?

1980
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:25,200
I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come.
It warms the very sickness in my heart

1981
02:45:25,200 --> 02:45:28,800
that I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
"Thus did'st thou."

1982
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:32,200
If it be so, Laertes -

1983
02:45:32,400 --> 02:45:36,600
as how should it be so, how otherwise? -
will you be ruled by me?

1984
02:45:36,800 --> 02:45:40,800
Ay, my lord, so you will not
o'errule me to a peace.

1985
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,400
To thine own peace.

1986
02:45:44,800 --> 02:45:50,200
If he be checking at his voyage,
I will work him to an exploit

1987
02:45:50,400 --> 02:45:55,200
under the which he shall not choose but fall,
and no wind of blame shall breathe,

1988
02:45:55,400 --> 02:45:58,400
but even his mother shall call it accident.

1989
02:45:58,600 --> 02:46:04,600
My lord, I will be ruled, the rather if you could
devise it so that I might be the organ.

1990
02:46:10,600 --> 02:46:12,600
It falls right.

1991
02:46:13,200 --> 02:46:17,200
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,

1992
02:46:17,400 --> 02:46:21,800
and that in Hamlet's hearing,
for a quality wherein they say you shine.

1993
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:25,800
Two months since,
here was a gentleman of Normandy.

1994
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:32,000
He gave you such a masterly report for art
and your defence, and your rapier most especial,

1995
02:46:32,200 --> 02:46:36,600
that he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
if one could match you.

1996
02:46:36,800 --> 02:46:40,400
This report of his did Hamlet
so envenom with his envy

1997
02:46:40,600 --> 02:46:46,000
that he could nothing do but wish and beg
your sudden coming o'er to play with you.

1998
02:46:46,200 --> 02:46:49,400
Now, out of this...

1999
02:46:52,600 --> 02:46:55,200
What out of this, my lord?

2000
02:46:56,000 --> 02:47:01,600
Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow?

2001
02:47:01,800 --> 02:47:07,400
- Why ask you this?
- I know love is begun by time,

2002
02:47:07,600 --> 02:47:13,200
and I see, in passages of proof,
time qualifies the fire and spark of it.

2003
02:47:13,400 --> 02:47:19,000
There lives within the very flame of love
a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it,

2004
02:47:19,200 --> 02:47:23,400
and nothing is at a like goodness still,
but goodness,

2005
02:47:23,600 --> 02:47:27,800
growing to a pleurisy, dies in his own too-much.

2006
02:47:29,600 --> 02:47:33,600
But to the quick o' the ulcer -
Hamlet comes back.

2007
02:47:33,800 --> 02:47:38,800
What would you undertake to show yourself
in deed your father's son more than in words?

2008
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
To cut his throat i' the church.

2009
02:47:43,200 --> 02:47:48,000
No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
revenge should know no bounds.

2010
02:47:48,200 --> 02:47:52,400
But good Laertes, will you do this,
keep close within your chamber?

2011
02:47:52,600 --> 02:47:57,000
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come back.
We'll praise your excellence,

2012
02:47:57,200 --> 02:48:02,600
set a varnish on your fame, bring you in
fine together and wager on your heads.

2013
02:48:02,800 --> 02:48:08,000
He, being remiss, most generous and free
from all contrivings, will not peruse the foils,

2014
02:48:08,200 --> 02:48:13,600
so that with ease, or with a little shuffling,
you may choose a sword unbated,

2015
02:48:13,800 --> 02:48:18,400
and in a pass of practise requite him
for your father.

2016
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:24,600
I will do't,
and for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.

2017
02:48:25,800 --> 02:48:30,400
I bought an unction
so mortal that but dip a knife in it,

2018
02:48:30,600 --> 02:48:33,200
where it draws blood, no cataplasm so rare,

2019
02:48:33,400 --> 02:48:37,000
collected from all simples
that have virtue under the moon,

2020
02:48:37,200 --> 02:48:41,000
can save the thing from death
that is but scratch'd withal.

2021
02:48:41,200 --> 02:48:47,200
I'll touch my point with this contagion,
that if I gall him slightly, it may be death.

2022
02:48:47,400 --> 02:48:50,000
Let's further think of this,

2023
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:54,600
weigh what convenience both of time and means
may fit us to our shape.

2024
02:48:54,600 --> 02:48:56,400
If this should fail,

2025
02:48:56,600 --> 02:49:00,400
and our drift look through our bad performance,
'twere better not assay'd.

2026
02:49:00,600 --> 02:49:05,800
Therefore this project should have a second
that might hold if this did blast in proof.

2027
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:12,600
Soft, let me see.
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings...

2028
02:49:12,800 --> 02:49:14,800
Oh! I ha't.

2029
02:49:17,400 --> 02:49:22,600
When in your motion you are hot and dry
and that he calls for drink,

2030
02:49:22,800 --> 02:49:27,200
I'll have preferred him a chalice
for the nonce, whereon but sipping,

2031
02:49:27,400 --> 02:49:31,800
if he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
our purpose may hold there.

2032
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
Stay, what noise?

2033
02:49:41,400 --> 02:49:47,800
One woe doth tread upon another's heels,
so fast they follow.

2034
02:49:52,400 --> 02:49:57,600
Your sister's...drown'd, Laertes.

2035
02:50:01,600 --> 02:50:03,600
Drown'd?

2036
02:50:06,400 --> 02:50:10,600
O...where?

2037
02:50:11,800 --> 02:50:18,800
There is a willow grows aslant the brook
that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.

2038
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:25,600
There with fantastic garlands she would make
of daisies, crow-flowers, nettles

2039
02:50:25,800 --> 02:50:31,400
and long purples which liberal shepherds
give a grosser name,

2040
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:36,400
but our cold maids
do dead men's fingers call them.

2041
02:50:38,400 --> 02:50:46,200
There on the pendent boughs
her coronet weeds clambering to hang,

2042
02:50:46,400 --> 02:50:49,200
an envious sliver broke,

2043
02:50:49,400 --> 02:50:54,800
when down her weedy trophies
and herself fell in the weeping brook.

2044
02:50:55,000 --> 02:51:02,000
Her clothes spread wide,
and mermaid-like awhile they bore her up,

2045
02:51:02,200 --> 02:51:08,600
which time she chanted snatches of old lauds,
as one incapable of her own distress,

2046
02:51:08,800 --> 02:51:13,600
or like a creature native
and indued unto that element,

2047
02:51:13,600 --> 02:51:21,000
but long it could not be till that her garments,
heavy with their drink,

2048
02:51:21,200 --> 02:51:26,800
pull'd the poor wretch
from her melodious lay to muddy death.

2049
02:51:29,800 --> 02:51:33,800
Alas...then she is drown'd?

2050
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
Drown'd.

2051
02:51:38,600 --> 02:51:40,600
Drown'd.

2052
02:51:44,600 --> 02:51:50,200
Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,

2053
02:51:53,600 --> 02:51:58,000
and therefore I forbid my tears,

2054
02:52:02,400 --> 02:52:05,400
but yet it is our trick;

2055
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:11,800
nature her custom holds,
let shame say what it will.

2056
02:52:17,600 --> 02:52:20,600
When these are gone, the woman will be out!

2057
02:52:22,800 --> 02:52:24,800
Adieu, my lord.

2058
02:52:25,800 --> 02:52:29,800
I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze...

2059
02:52:31,200 --> 02:52:36,200
but that this folly douts it.

2060
02:52:38,600 --> 02:52:40,600
Let's follow, Gertrude.

2061
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:48,800
How much I had to do to calm his rage!

2062
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:52,000
Now fear I this will give it start again.

2063
02:52:52,200 --> 02:52:54,600
Therefore let's follow.

2064
02:52:57,400 --> 02:53:02,400
Is she to be buried in Christian burial
when she wilfully seeks her own salvation?

2065
02:53:02,600 --> 02:53:06,200
I tell thee she is,
therefore make her grave straight.

2066
02:53:06,400 --> 02:53:09,000
The crowner finds it Christian burial.

2067
02:53:09,200 --> 02:53:14,400
How can that be, unless she drowned herself
in her own defence?

2068
02:53:14,600 --> 02:53:18,600
- Why, 'tis found so.
- It must be "se offendendo".

2069
02:53:18,800 --> 02:53:22,200
For if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act,

2070
02:53:22,400 --> 02:53:27,000
and an act hath three branches -
to act, to do, to perform.

2071
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:30,800
- Argal, she drowned herself wittingly.
- Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver...

2072
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:36,000
Give me leave. Here lies the water - good.
Here stands the man - good.

2073
02:53:36,200 --> 02:53:42,600
If the man go to this water, and drown himself,
it is, will he nill he, he goes.

2074
02:53:42,600 --> 02:53:47,600
But if the water come to him and drown him,
he drowns not himself.

2075
02:53:47,800 --> 02:53:51,800
Argal, he that is not guilty of his own death
shortens not his own life.

2076
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:55,800
- But is this law?
- Ay, marry is't, crowner's quest law.

2077
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,800
If this had not been a gentlewoman,

2078
02:53:58,800 --> 02:54:02,000
she should have been buried
out o' Christian burial.

2079
02:54:02,200 --> 02:54:08,200
There thou say'st. The more pity that great folk
should have countenance in this world

2080
02:54:08,400 --> 02:54:12,400
to drown or hang themselves
more than their even Christian.

2081
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
Come, my spade.

2082
02:54:15,200 --> 02:54:20,600
There is no ancient gentleman
but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers.

2083
02:54:20,800 --> 02:54:24,000
- They hold up Adam's profession.
- Was he a gentleman?

2084
02:54:24,200 --> 02:54:27,800
- He was the first ever bore arms.
- Why, he had none.

2085
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:31,200
Art a heathen?
How dost thou understand the Scripture?

2086
02:54:31,400 --> 02:54:34,000
The Scripture says "Adam digged".

2087
02:54:37,400 --> 02:54:41,400
Could he dig without arms?
I'll put another question to thee.

2088
02:54:41,600 --> 02:54:44,800
If thou answerest me not to the purpose,
confess thyself...

2089
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:48,400
- Go to.
- What is he that builds stronger

2090
02:54:48,600 --> 02:54:52,400
than either the mason,
the shipwright, or the carpenter?

2091
02:54:52,600 --> 02:54:56,600
The gallows-maker,
for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.

2092
02:54:56,600 --> 02:55:03,800
I like thy wit well. The gallows does well,
but it does well to those that do ill.

2093
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:07,600
Thou dost ill to say the gallows
is stronger than the church.

2094
02:55:07,800 --> 02:55:12,200
Argal, the gallows may do well to thee.
To't again, come.

2095
02:55:12,200 --> 02:55:15,400
Who builds stronger than a mason,
a shipwright, or a carpenter?

2096
02:55:15,600 --> 02:55:18,400
- Tell me that and unyoke.
- Marry, I can tell.

2097
02:55:18,600 --> 02:55:20,600
To't.

2098
02:55:20,800 --> 02:55:26,400
- Mass, I cannot tell.
- Cudgel thy brains no more about it.

2099
02:55:26,600 --> 02:55:31,200
When you are asked this question next,
say "a grave-maker".

2100
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:35,600
- The houses he makes...
- ..last until doomsday.

2101
02:55:36,200 --> 02:55:40,400
Go, get thee to Yaughan.
Fetch me a stoup of liquor.

2102
02:55:40,600 --> 02:55:44,200
# In youth, when I did love, did love

2103
02:55:44,400 --> 02:55:46,600
# Methought it were very sweet

2104
02:55:46,800 --> 02:55:49,800
# To contract the time a my behove

2105
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:53,000
# Methought there was nothing meet #

2106
02:55:54,400 --> 02:55:59,400
Has this fellow no feeling of his business,
that he sings at grave-making?

2107
02:55:59,600 --> 02:56:03,600
Custom hath made it in him
a property of easiness.

2108
02:56:04,400 --> 02:56:09,800
'Tis e'en so, the hand of little employment
hath the daintier sense.

2109
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,600
# But age with his stealing step

2110
02:56:12,800 --> 02:56:15,800
# Hath claw'd me in his clutch

2111
02:56:15,800 --> 02:56:18,400
# And shipped me intil the land

2112
02:56:18,600 --> 02:56:21,600
# As if I had never been such #

2113
02:56:22,600 --> 02:56:26,400
That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once.

2114
02:56:26,600 --> 02:56:32,200
How the knave jowls it to the ground,
as if it were Cain's, that did the first murder.

2115
02:56:32,400 --> 02:56:36,800
This might be the pate of a politician,
which this ass now o'erreaches,

2116
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,800
one that would circumvent God, might it not?

2117
02:56:39,800 --> 02:56:42,800
- It might, my lord.
- Or of a courtier,

2118
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:47,400
which could say "Good morrow, sweet lord.
How dost thou, sweet lord?"

2119
02:56:47,600 --> 02:56:50,600
This might be my lord Such-a-one,

2120
02:56:50,600 --> 02:56:54,600
who praised my lord Such-a-one's horse,
when a meant to beg it.

2121
02:56:54,600 --> 02:56:57,800
- Ay, my lord.
- Why, e'en so.

2122
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:04,400
And now my lady Worm's, chapless, and knocked
about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:

2123
02:57:04,600 --> 02:57:08,200
Here's fine revolution
and we had the trick to see't.

2124
02:57:08,400 --> 02:57:10,800
# For and a shrouding sheet

2125
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:14,400
# O, a pit of clay for to be made

2126
02:57:14,600 --> 02:57:18,000
# For such a guest is meet #

2127
02:57:19,600 --> 02:57:25,000
There's another.
Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?

2128
02:57:25,200 --> 02:57:29,400
Why does he suffer this rude knave now
to knock him with a shovel,

2129
02:57:29,600 --> 02:57:33,200
and will not tell him of his action of battery?

2130
02:57:33,400 --> 02:57:35,400
Hmm?

2131
02:57:36,200 --> 02:57:38,400
I'll speak to this fellow.

2132
02:57:41,600 --> 02:57:44,400
- Whose grave's this, sirrah?
- Mine, sir.

2133
02:57:44,600 --> 02:57:47,600
# O, a pit of clay for to be made

2134
02:57:47,800 --> 02:57:49,800
# For such a guest is meet #

2135
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:53,000
Indeed, I think it be thine. Thou liest in't.

2136
02:57:53,200 --> 02:57:57,600
You lie out on't, so therefore it's not yours.
I do not lie in it, yet it is mine.

2137
02:57:57,800 --> 02:58:02,400
Thou dost lie in it to say it is thine.
'Tis for the dead, therefore thou liest.

2138
02:58:02,600 --> 02:58:06,200
'Tis a quick lie. 'Twill away gain from me to you.

2139
02:58:06,400 --> 02:58:09,200
- What man dost thou dig it for?
- No man.

2140
02:58:09,400 --> 02:58:11,600
- What woman, then?
- None, neither.

2141
02:58:11,800 --> 02:58:16,600
- Who is to be buried in't?
- One that was a woman, sir, but she's dead.

2142
02:58:16,800 --> 02:58:19,800
How absolute the knave is!

2143
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:24,600
We must speak by the card
or equivocation will undo us.

2144
02:58:25,400 --> 02:58:27,600
How long hast thou been a grave-maker?

2145
02:58:27,800 --> 02:58:34,000
Of all the days in the year, I came to't that day
our last king, Hamlet, overcame Fortinbras.

2146
02:58:34,200 --> 02:58:37,400
- How long is that since?
- Cannot you tell that?

2147
02:58:37,600 --> 02:58:42,600
Every fool can tell that. It was the very day
that young Hamlet was born,

2148
02:58:42,800 --> 02:58:46,200
he that is mad and sent into England.

2149
02:58:46,400 --> 02:58:49,200
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?

2150
02:58:49,400 --> 02:58:51,400
Why, because he was mad.

2151
02:58:51,600 --> 02:58:55,800
He shall recover his wits there,
or if he do not, 'tis no matter there.

2152
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,400
- Why?
- 'Twill not be seen in him there.

2153
02:58:58,600 --> 02:59:01,400
There the men are as mad as he.

2154
02:59:01,600 --> 02:59:05,400
- How came he mad?
- Very strangely, they say.

2155
02:59:05,600 --> 02:59:08,800
- How strangely?
- Faith, e'en with losing his wits.

2156
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:12,000
- Upon what ground?
- Why, here in Denmark.

2157
02:59:12,200 --> 02:59:19,000
I have been sexton here,
man and boy, thirty years.

2158
02:59:19,200 --> 02:59:22,800
How long will a man lie in the earth ere he rot?

2159
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:29,400
If he be not rotten before he die -
as we have many pocky corses nowadays

2160
02:59:29,600 --> 02:59:34,200
that will scarce hold the laying in -
he will last some eight year, nine year.

2161
02:59:34,400 --> 02:59:39,200
- A tanner will last you nine year.
- Why he more than another?

2162
02:59:39,400 --> 02:59:45,400
His hide is so tanned with his trade,
that he will keep out water a great while,

2163
02:59:45,600 --> 02:59:52,400
and your water is a sore decayer
of your whoreson dead body.

2164
02:59:52,400 --> 02:59:58,400
Here's a skull now hath lain in the earth
three and twenty years.

2165
02:59:58,600 --> 03:00:01,400
- Whose was it?
- A whoreson mad fellow's it was.

2166
03:00:01,600 --> 03:00:05,000
- Whose do you think it was?
- Nay, I know not.

2167
03:00:05,200 --> 03:00:11,600
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue!
Poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once.

2168
03:00:11,800 --> 03:00:14,400
This same skull, sir, was, sir...

2169
03:00:15,600 --> 03:00:18,600
..Yorick's skull, the king's jester.

2170
03:00:18,800 --> 03:00:21,200
- This?
- E'en that.

2171
03:00:21,400 --> 03:00:23,400
Let me see.

2172
03:00:27,600 --> 03:00:29,000
Alas.

2173
03:00:30,800 --> 03:00:32,800
Poor Yorick.

2174
03:00:34,600 --> 03:00:36,600
I knew him, Horatio.

2175
03:00:38,200 --> 03:00:42,800
A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.

2176
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:49,400
He hath borne me on his back a thousand times,

2177
03:00:49,600 --> 03:00:55,200
and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is.

2178
03:00:55,400 --> 03:00:57,400
My gorge rises at it.

2179
03:00:57,600 --> 03:01:02,400
Here hung those lips
that I have kissed I know not how oft.

2180
03:01:02,600 --> 03:01:05,000
Where be your gibes now,

2181
03:01:05,200 --> 03:01:09,400
your gambols, your songs,
your flashes of merriment

2182
03:01:09,400 --> 03:01:12,800
that were wont to set the table on a roar?

2183
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:16,400
Not one now to mock your own grinning.

2184
03:01:17,200 --> 03:01:19,200
Quite chap-fallen.

2185
03:01:21,200 --> 03:01:24,200
Now get you to my lady's chamber

2186
03:01:24,400 --> 03:01:28,600
and tell her, let her paint an inch thick,

2187
03:01:28,800 --> 03:01:32,000
to this favour she must come.

2188
03:01:34,200 --> 03:01:37,200
Make her laugh at that.

2189
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:44,000
Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.

2190
03:01:44,600 --> 03:01:46,400
What's that, my lord?

2191
03:01:46,600 --> 03:01:52,000
Dost thou think Alexander
looked o' this fashion in the earth?

2192
03:01:52,200 --> 03:01:57,000
- E'en so, my lord.
- And smelt so? Pooh!

2193
03:01:57,200 --> 03:01:59,000
E'en so.

2194
03:01:59,200 --> 03:02:02,600
To what base uses we may return, Horatio!

2195
03:02:02,800 --> 03:02:06,400
Why may not imagination
trace the noble dust of Alexander

2196
03:02:06,600 --> 03:02:09,200
till he find it stopping a bung-hole?

2197
03:02:09,400 --> 03:02:12,600
'Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.

2198
03:02:12,800 --> 03:02:14,800
No, faith, not a jot, as thus -

2199
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:20,200
Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
Alexander returneth into dust.

2200
03:02:20,400 --> 03:02:24,800
The dust is earth, of earth we make loam,

2201
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:30,800
and why of that loam, whereto he was converted,
might they not stop a beer-barrel?

2202
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:36,800
Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,

2203
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:41,200
might stop a hole to keep the wind away.

2204
03:02:42,600 --> 03:02:48,200
O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,

2205
03:02:48,400 --> 03:02:52,400
should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw.

2206
03:02:55,400 --> 03:02:58,200
Soft! Soft a while!

2207
03:02:58,400 --> 03:03:01,200
Here comes the king, the queen, the courtiers.

2208
03:03:01,400 --> 03:03:04,000
Who do they follow, with such maimed rites?

2209
03:03:04,200 --> 03:03:09,000
This doth betoken the corse did
with desperate hand fordo it own life.

2210
03:03:09,200 --> 03:03:11,200
Couch we awhile and mark.

2211
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:56,400
- What ceremony else?
- That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.

2212
03:03:56,600 --> 03:03:58,600
What ceremony else?

2213
03:03:58,800 --> 03:04:03,000
Her obsequies have been as far
enlarged as we have warrantise.

2214
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:07,800
Her death was doubtful, and but that
great command o'ersways the order,

2215
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:11,600
she should in ground unsanctified have lodged
till the last trumpet -

2216
03:04:11,800 --> 03:04:16,600
for charitable prayers, shards, flints
and pebbles should be thrown on her,

2217
03:04:16,800 --> 03:04:20,400
yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
her maiden strewments

2218
03:04:20,600 --> 03:04:23,400
and the bringing home of bell and burial.

2219
03:04:23,600 --> 03:04:27,400
- Must there no more be done?
- No more be done.

2220
03:04:27,600 --> 03:04:30,400
We should profane the service of the dead

2221
03:04:30,600 --> 03:04:36,400
to sing sage requiem and such rest to her
as to peace-parted souls.

2222
03:04:39,600 --> 03:04:41,800
Lay her i' the earth.

2223
03:04:43,800 --> 03:04:48,400
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
may violets spring.

2224
03:04:49,600 --> 03:04:55,200
I tell thee, churlish priest, an angel
shall my sister be when thou liest howling.

2225
03:04:55,400 --> 03:04:57,600
What, the fair Ophelia?

2226
03:04:59,200 --> 03:05:02,600
Sweets to the sweet.

2227
03:05:03,800 --> 03:05:05,800
Farewell.

2228
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:10,600
I hoped thou wouldst have been my Hamlet's wife.

2229
03:05:10,800 --> 03:05:18,000
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd,
sweet maid, and not have strew'd thy grave.

2230
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:25,200
O, treble woe fall ten times treble
on that cursed head

2231
03:05:25,400 --> 03:05:29,000
whose wicked deed
thy most ingenious sense deprived thee of.

2232
03:05:29,400 --> 03:05:35,600
Hold off the earth awhile, till I have
caught her once more in mine arms.

2233
03:05:52,800 --> 03:05:59,600
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
till of this flat a mountain you have made

2234
03:05:59,800 --> 03:06:03,400
to o'ertop old Pelion
or the skyish head of blue Olympus!

2235
03:06:03,600 --> 03:06:07,800
What is he whose grief bears such an emphasis,

2236
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:11,200
whose phrase of sorrow
conjures the wandering stars

2237
03:06:11,200 --> 03:06:14,200
and makes them stand
like wonder-wounded hearers?

2238
03:06:14,400 --> 03:06:16,600
This is I, Hamlet the Dane!

2239
03:06:16,800 --> 03:06:20,600
The devil take thy soul!

2240
03:06:20,800 --> 03:06:24,600
Thou pray'st not well!
Take thy fingers from my throat!

2241
03:06:24,800 --> 03:06:27,800
(KING) Pluck them asunder.
(HORATIO ) My lord, be quiet.

2242
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:33,400
Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
until my eyelids will no longer wag.

2243
03:06:33,600 --> 03:06:37,600
- O my son, what theme?
- I loved Ophelia!

2244
03:06:37,600 --> 03:06:43,200
Forty thousand brothers could not with
all their quantity of love make up my sum.

2245
03:06:43,400 --> 03:06:46,200
- What wilt thou do for her?
- He is mad!

2246
03:06:46,400 --> 03:06:52,000
- For love of God, forbear him.
- Woo't weep? Woo't fight? Woo't fast?

2247
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:57,600
Woo't tear thyself? Woo't drink up eisel?
Eat a crocodile? I'll do it!

2248
03:06:57,800 --> 03:07:03,600
Dost thou come here to whine?
To outface me with leaping in her grave?

2249
03:07:03,800 --> 03:07:07,200
Be buried quick with her, and so will l!

2250
03:07:07,400 --> 03:07:13,000
And if thou prate of mountains,
let them throw millions of acres on us,

2251
03:07:13,200 --> 03:07:18,200
till our ground, singeing his pate against
the burning zone, make Ossa like a wart!

2252
03:07:20,600 --> 03:07:25,400
Nay, an thou'lt mouth, I'll rant as well as thou!

2253
03:07:25,600 --> 03:07:29,600
This is mere madness.
Awhile the fit will work on him.

2254
03:07:29,600 --> 03:07:33,800
Anon, as patient as the female dove
when that her couplets are disclosed,

2255
03:07:33,800 --> 03:07:36,200
his silence will sit drooping.

2256
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:43,200
Hear you, sir.
What is the reason that you use me thus?

2257
03:07:43,400 --> 03:07:45,400
I loved you ever.

2258
03:07:46,800 --> 03:07:52,800
But it is no matter.
Let Hercules himself do what he may,

2259
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:58,800
the cat will mew and dog will have his day.

2260
03:08:00,200 --> 03:08:03,200
I pray you, good Horatio, wait on him.

2261
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:08,600
Strengthen your patience
in our last night's speech.

2262
03:08:08,800 --> 03:08:11,600
We'll put the matter to the present push.

2263
03:08:13,800 --> 03:08:17,000
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.

2264
03:08:22,600 --> 03:08:25,600
This grave shall have a living monument.

2265
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:32,400
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see.
Till then in patience our proceedings be.

2266
03:08:34,400 --> 03:08:38,200
So much for this, sir. Now shall you see the other.

2267
03:08:38,400 --> 03:08:41,600
- You do remember all the circumstance?
- Remember it, my lord?

2268
03:08:41,800 --> 03:08:46,000
Sir, in my heart there was fighting
that would not let me sleep.

2269
03:08:46,200 --> 03:08:49,400
Methought I lay worse
than the mutines in the bilboes.

2270
03:08:49,600 --> 03:08:53,200
Rashly - and prais'd be rashness for it.

2271
03:08:53,400 --> 03:08:59,400
Let us know, our indiscretion sometimes
serves us well when our deep plots do pall.

2272
03:08:59,600 --> 03:09:05,200
And that should learn us
there's a divinity that shapes our ends.

2273
03:09:05,400 --> 03:09:07,000
That is most certain.

2274
03:09:07,200 --> 03:09:12,400
Up from my cabin,
in the dark groped I to find out them,

2275
03:09:12,400 --> 03:09:16,000
finger'd their packet,
and withdrew to mine own room again;

2276
03:09:16,200 --> 03:09:21,800
making so bold, my fears forgetting manners,
to unseal their grand commission,

2277
03:09:21,800 --> 03:09:25,400
where I found, Horatio - O royal knavery! -

2278
03:09:25,600 --> 03:09:29,200
an exact command,
larded with many several sorts of reasons

2279
03:09:29,400 --> 03:09:32,800
importing Denmark's health and England's too,

2280
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:39,000
with, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
that on the supervise, no leisure bated,

2281
03:09:39,200 --> 03:09:44,200
no, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
my head should be struck off.

2282
03:09:44,400 --> 03:09:47,600
- Is't possible?
- Here's the commission. Read it at leisure.

2283
03:09:47,800 --> 03:09:51,000
- Wilt thou hear how I did proceed?
- I beseech you.

2284
03:09:51,200 --> 03:09:56,400
Being thus benetted round with villanies,
I sat me down, devised a new commission,

2285
03:09:56,600 --> 03:10:03,000
wrote it fair - I once did hold it,
as our statists do, a baseness to write fair,

2286
03:10:03,200 --> 03:10:05,800
but, sir, now it did me yeoman's service.

2287
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:09,400
- Wilt thou know what I wrote?
- Ay, my lord.

2288
03:10:09,600 --> 03:10:14,800
An earnest conjuration from the king,
as England was his faithful tributary,

2289
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:19,000
as love between them
like the palm might flourish,

2290
03:10:19,200 --> 03:10:24,600
as peace should still her wheaten garland wear
and stand a comma 'tween their amities,

2291
03:10:24,600 --> 03:10:28,400
and many such-like "as"es of great charge,

2292
03:10:28,600 --> 03:10:32,800
that on the view of those contents,
without debatement further, more or less,

2293
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:36,000
he should those bearers put to sudden death,

2294
03:10:37,200 --> 03:10:40,000
not shriving-time allow'd.

2295
03:10:41,800 --> 03:10:46,000
- How was this seal'd?
- Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.

2296
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:50,600
I had my father's signet in my purse,
which was the model of that Danish seal.

2297
03:10:50,800 --> 03:10:55,200
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.

2298
03:10:57,000 --> 03:11:01,600
Why, man, they did make love to this employment.

2299
03:11:01,800 --> 03:11:04,400
They are not near my conscience.

2300
03:11:04,600 --> 03:11:08,200
Their defeat does by their own insinuation grow.

2301
03:11:08,400 --> 03:11:11,800
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature
comes between the pass

2302
03:11:12,000 --> 03:11:15,000
and fell incensed points of mighty opposites.

2303
03:11:16,800 --> 03:11:21,200
- Why, what a king is this!
- Does it not stand me upon -

2304
03:11:21,200 --> 03:11:24,400
he that hath kill'd my king, whored my mother,

2305
03:11:24,600 --> 03:11:30,000
popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
thrown out his angle for my proper life -

2306
03:11:30,200 --> 03:11:33,200
is't not perfect conscience
to quit him with this arm?

2307
03:11:33,400 --> 03:11:39,400
And is't not to be damn'd to let this canker
of our nature come in further evil?

2308
03:11:47,600 --> 03:11:54,000
It must be shortly known to him from England
what is the issue of the business there.

2309
03:11:54,200 --> 03:12:02,200
It will be short. The interim is mine.
And a man's life's no more than to say "one".

2310
03:12:04,200 --> 03:12:07,800
But I am very sorry that to Laertes I forgot myself.

2311
03:12:08,800 --> 03:12:13,200
For by the image of my cause
I see the portraiture of his.

2312
03:12:13,400 --> 03:12:19,000
I'll court his favours. But the bravery of his grief
did put me into a towering passion.

2313
03:12:19,200 --> 03:12:21,000
Peace, who comes here?

2314
03:12:21,200 --> 03:12:26,200
- Your lordship is welcome back to Denmark.
- I humbly thank you, sir.

2315
03:12:26,200 --> 03:12:28,800
Dost know this water-fly?

2316
03:12:28,800 --> 03:12:32,600
- No, good my lord.
- 'Tis a vice to know him.

2317
03:12:32,800 --> 03:12:35,000
He hath much land, and fertile.

2318
03:12:35,200 --> 03:12:38,800
'Tis a chuff, but spacious in the possession of dirt.

2319
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:44,600
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure,
I should impart a thing from His Majesty.

2320
03:12:44,800 --> 03:12:47,800
I shall receive it with all diligence of spirit.

2321
03:12:47,800 --> 03:12:51,600
Put your bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.

2322
03:12:51,800 --> 03:12:56,600
- I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
- No, believe me, it's very cold.

2323
03:12:56,800 --> 03:13:02,000
- The wind is northerly.
- It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.

2324
03:13:02,200 --> 03:13:06,600
But yet methinks it is very sultry
and hot for my complexion.

2325
03:13:06,800 --> 03:13:13,400
Exceedingly, my lord. It is very sultry,
as 'twere...I cannot tell how.

2326
03:13:15,400 --> 03:13:23,000
But, my lord, His Majesty bade me signify to you
that he has laid a great wager on your head.

2327
03:13:23,200 --> 03:13:26,200
- This is the matter...
- I beseech you, remember.

2328
03:13:26,400 --> 03:13:30,600
Nay, good my lord, for my ease...in good faith.

2329
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:38,400
Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes -

2330
03:13:38,400 --> 03:13:43,000
believe me, an absolute gentleman,
full of most excellent differences,

2331
03:13:43,200 --> 03:13:46,000
of very soft society and great showing.

2332
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:51,000
Indeed, to speak feelingly of him,
he is the card or calendar of gentry,

2333
03:13:51,200 --> 03:13:54,800
<i>the continent of what part a gentleman would see.</i>

2334
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:58,800
<i>Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you,</i>

2335
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:03,000
though I know, to divide him inventorially
would dizzy the arithmetic of memory,

2336
03:14:03,200 --> 03:14:06,200
and but yaw in respect of his quick sail.

2337
03:14:06,200 --> 03:14:13,600
<i>But I take him to be a soul of great article,
and his infusion of such dearth and rareness</i>

2338
03:14:13,800 --> 03:14:19,200
<i>as to make true diction of him,
his semblable is his mirror</i>

2339
03:14:19,400 --> 03:14:23,200
<i>and who else would trace him,
his umbrage, nothing more.</i>

2340
03:14:23,400 --> 03:14:28,000
- Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
- The concernancy, sir?

2341
03:14:28,200 --> 03:14:31,600
Why do we wrap the gentleman
in our more rawer breath?

2342
03:14:33,200 --> 03:14:35,000
Sir?

2343
03:14:35,000 --> 03:14:39,600
Is't not possible to understand
in another tongue? You will do't, sir, really.

2344
03:14:39,800 --> 03:14:44,800
- What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
- Of...of..of Laertes?

2345
03:14:45,800 --> 03:14:49,600
His purse is empty already.
All his golden words are spent.

2346
03:14:49,800 --> 03:14:52,800
- Of him, sir.
- I know you are not ignorant...

2347
03:14:53,000 --> 03:14:57,600
I would you did. And yet, in faith, if you did,
it would not much approve me.

2348
03:14:57,800 --> 03:15:01,000
You are not ignorant
of what excellence Laertes is...

2349
03:15:01,200 --> 03:15:06,800
I dare not confess that,
lest I should compare with him in excellence.

2350
03:15:07,000 --> 03:15:10,000
But to know a man well were to know himself.

2351
03:15:10,200 --> 03:15:16,200
I mean for his weapon. But in the imputation
laid on him by them in his meed, he's unfellowed.

2352
03:15:17,600 --> 03:15:20,800
- What's his weapon?
- Rapier and dagger.

2353
03:15:22,200 --> 03:15:26,400
That's two of his weapons. But well.

2354
03:15:26,600 --> 03:15:28,800
The king, sir, hath laid, sir,

2355
03:15:28,800 --> 03:15:34,600
that in a dozen passes between yourself
and him, he shall not exceed you three hits.

2356
03:15:34,800 --> 03:15:40,600
It would come to immediate trial
if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.

2357
03:15:40,800 --> 03:15:44,400
How if I answer no?

2358
03:15:47,000 --> 03:15:52,000
I mean, my lord,
the opposition of your person in trial.

2359
03:15:53,600 --> 03:16:00,400
Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please His
Majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me.

2360
03:16:00,600 --> 03:16:05,200
Let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing,
and the king hold his purpose.

2361
03:16:05,400 --> 03:16:13,000
I will win for him and I can. If not, I will
gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.

2362
03:16:13,200 --> 03:16:16,200
- Shall I re-deliver you even so?
- To this effect.

2363
03:16:17,800 --> 03:16:21,400
After what flourish your nature will.

2364
03:16:21,600 --> 03:16:24,400
I commend my duty to your lordship.

2365
03:16:24,600 --> 03:16:25,800
Yours, yours.

2366
03:16:39,600 --> 03:16:43,000
He does well to commend it himself.

2367
03:16:43,200 --> 03:16:46,600
There are no tongues else for's turn.

2368
03:16:46,800 --> 03:16:50,200
This lapwing runs away
with his shell on his head.

2369
03:16:50,400 --> 03:16:54,200
A did comply with his dug before he sucked it.

2370
03:16:54,400 --> 03:16:59,000
- You will lose this wager, my lord.
- I do not think so.

2371
03:16:59,200 --> 03:17:05,200
Since he went into France, I have been
in continual practice. I shall win at the odds.

2372
03:17:05,400 --> 03:17:10,200
But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
about my heart: but it is no matter.

2373
03:17:10,400 --> 03:17:14,600
- Nay, good my lord...
- It is but foolery,

2374
03:17:14,800 --> 03:17:20,000
but yet it is such a kind of gaingiving
as would perhaps trouble a woman.

2375
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:27,200
If your mind dislike anything, obey it.
I will say you are not fit.

2376
03:17:27,400 --> 03:17:34,400
Not a whit, we defy augury. There's a special
providence in the fall of a sparrow.

2377
03:17:36,600 --> 03:17:39,800
If it be now, 'tis not to come.

2378
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:43,800
If it be not to come, it will be now.

2379
03:17:44,000 --> 03:17:48,800
If it be not now, yet it will come.

2380
03:17:50,800 --> 03:17:55,400
The readiness is all. Let be.

2381
03:17:57,200 --> 03:18:00,800
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.

2382
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:04,200
Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong.

2383
03:18:04,400 --> 03:18:07,000
But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.

2384
03:18:07,200 --> 03:18:10,600
This presence knows,
and you must needs have heard,

2385
03:18:10,800 --> 03:18:13,600
how I am punish'd with a sore distraction.

2386
03:18:13,800 --> 03:18:18,000
What I have done that might your nature,
honour and exception roughly awake,

2387
03:18:18,200 --> 03:18:22,000
I here proclaim was madness.

2388
03:18:22,200 --> 03:18:25,400
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.

2389
03:18:25,600 --> 03:18:30,600
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
and when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,

2390
03:18:30,800 --> 03:18:33,200
Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.

2391
03:18:33,400 --> 03:18:36,200
Who does it, then? His madness.

2392
03:18:36,400 --> 03:18:42,600
If't be so, Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd.
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.

2393
03:18:42,800 --> 03:18:49,200
Sir, let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
free me so far in your most generous thoughts

2394
03:18:49,200 --> 03:18:54,800
that I have shot mine arrow o'er the house
and hurt my brother.

2395
03:18:55,000 --> 03:18:59,800
I am satisfied in nature, whose motive
should stir me most to my revenge,

2396
03:19:00,000 --> 03:19:05,200
but in my terms of honour I stand aloof
and will no reconcilement

2397
03:19:05,400 --> 03:19:08,200
till by some elder masters of known honour

2398
03:19:08,200 --> 03:19:12,600
I have a voice and precedent of peace
to keep my name ungored.

2399
03:19:12,800 --> 03:19:17,400
Till that time, I do receive your offer'd love
like love, and will not wrong it.

2400
03:19:17,800 --> 03:19:23,000
I embrace it freely,
and will this brother's wager frankly play.

2401
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:26,000
- Give us the foils.
- Come, one for me.

2402
03:19:26,000 --> 03:19:32,800
I'll be your foil. In mine ignorance your skill
shall like a star in the night stick fiery off indeed.

2403
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:36,400
- You mock me, sir.
- No, by this hand.

2404
03:19:36,600 --> 03:19:39,000
Give them the foils, young Osric.

2405
03:19:39,000 --> 03:19:41,600
- Hamlet, you know the wager?
- Very well.

2406
03:19:41,800 --> 03:19:44,600
You hath laid the odds on the weaker side.

2407
03:19:44,600 --> 03:19:49,400
I do not fear it.
Since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.

2408
03:19:49,600 --> 03:19:53,800
- This is too heavy. Let me see another.
- This likes me well.

2409
03:19:53,800 --> 03:19:57,200
- These foils have all a length?
- Ay, my good lord.

2410
03:19:59,600 --> 03:20:05,400
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
If Hamlet make the first or second hit,

2411
03:20:05,600 --> 03:20:10,200
or quit in answer of the third exchanges,
let all ordnance fire -

2412
03:20:10,200 --> 03:20:13,400
the king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath.

2413
03:20:13,600 --> 03:20:17,800
In the cup an union shall he throw

2414
03:20:17,800 --> 03:20:23,200
richer than that which four successive kings
in Denmark's crown have worn.

2415
03:20:23,400 --> 03:20:25,400
Give me the cup.

2416
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:33,400
Let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
the trumpet to the cannoneer without,

2417
03:20:33,600 --> 03:20:40,200
the cannons to the heavens, the heaven
to earth, "Now the king drinks to Hamlet."

2418
03:20:42,600 --> 03:20:45,600
(FANFARE)

2419
03:20:47,600 --> 03:20:50,800
Come, begin.
You, the judges, bear a wary eye.

2420
03:20:58,200 --> 03:21:02,000
- Come on, sir.
- Come...my lord.

2421
03:21:08,800 --> 03:21:10,200
- One!
- No!

2422
03:21:10,400 --> 03:21:13,600
- Judgment.
- A hit. A very palpable hit.

2423
03:21:13,800 --> 03:21:18,800
- Well, again.
- Stay. Give me drink.

2424
03:21:20,600 --> 03:21:25,200
Hamlet, this pearl is thine. Here's to thy health.

2425
03:21:32,000 --> 03:21:36,600
- Give him the cup.
- I'll play this bout first. Set it by awhile.

2426
03:21:36,800 --> 03:21:38,200
Come.

2427
03:22:18,400 --> 03:22:23,200
- Another hit. What say you?
- A touch, a touch, I do confess.

2428
03:22:23,400 --> 03:22:26,800
- Our son shall win.
- He's fat and scant of breath.

2429
03:22:27,000 --> 03:22:32,200
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.

2430
03:22:32,200 --> 03:22:34,600
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.

2431
03:22:34,800 --> 03:22:37,800
- Good madam.
- Gertrude, do not drink.

2432
03:22:39,000 --> 03:22:41,800
I will, my lord. I pray you, pardon me.

2433
03:22:44,200 --> 03:22:47,200
(SOFTLY) 'Tis the poison'd cup. It is too late.

2434
03:22:48,400 --> 03:22:53,600
- I dare not drink yet, madam. By and by.
- Come, let me wipe thy face.

2435
03:22:54,400 --> 03:22:58,000
- My lord, I'll hit him now.
- I do not think't.

2436
03:23:00,400 --> 03:23:03,400
And yet it is almost against my conscience.

2437
03:23:04,600 --> 03:23:10,000
Come, for the third, Laertes. You but dally.
I pray you, pass with your best violence.

2438
03:23:10,200 --> 03:23:13,400
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.

2439
03:23:13,600 --> 03:23:15,600
Say you so?

2440
03:23:15,800 --> 03:23:17,800
Come on.

2441
03:23:25,600 --> 03:23:28,400
(APPLAUSE)

2442
03:23:33,600 --> 03:23:36,800
Nothing neither way.

2443
03:23:44,600 --> 03:23:46,800
Have at you now.

2444
03:24:00,800 --> 03:24:03,800
- Part them! They are incensed!
- Nay, come again!

2445
03:24:22,600 --> 03:24:27,400
- Look to the queen there, ho!
- They bleed on both sides. My lord?

2446
03:24:27,400 --> 03:24:32,400
As a woodcock to mine own springe,
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.

2447
03:24:34,000 --> 03:24:38,200
- How does the queen?
- She swounds to see them bleed.

2448
03:24:38,400 --> 03:24:46,200
The drink! The drink!
O my dear Hamlet...the drink, the drink...

2449
03:24:46,400 --> 03:24:49,200
I am...poison'd.

2450
03:24:51,000 --> 03:24:56,800
O villainy! Ho! Let the doors be lock'd!
Treachery! Seek it out!

2451
03:24:57,000 --> 03:25:02,400
It is here, Hamlet! Hamlet, thou art slain.

2452
03:25:02,600 --> 03:25:09,000
No medicine in the world can do thee good.
In thee there is not half an hour's life.

2453
03:25:09,200 --> 03:25:14,800
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
unbated and envenom'd.

2454
03:25:17,800 --> 03:25:23,200
The foul practise hath turn'd itself on me...

2455
03:25:23,400 --> 03:25:28,000
Lo, here I lie, never to rise again.

2456
03:25:28,200 --> 03:25:32,600
Thy mother's poison'd. I can no more.

2457
03:25:35,000 --> 03:25:37,400
The king...

2458
03:25:37,600 --> 03:25:40,200
The king's to blame!

2459
03:25:40,400 --> 03:25:43,200
The point envenom'd too!

2460
03:25:43,400 --> 03:25:46,600
Then, venom, to thy work.

2461
03:25:49,600 --> 03:25:51,400
(WHISPERS) Treason.

2462
03:25:51,600 --> 03:25:53,800
Treason!

2463
03:25:54,200 --> 03:25:57,200
O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt!

2464
03:25:57,400 --> 03:26:02,600
Here, thou incestuous, murderous,
damned Dane, drink off this potion!

2465
03:26:02,800 --> 03:26:07,200
Is thy union here? Follow my mother!

2466
03:26:09,800 --> 03:26:14,800
He is justly served.
It is a poison temper'd by himself.

2467
03:26:17,200 --> 03:26:20,200
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.

2468
03:26:21,200 --> 03:26:27,200
Mine and my father's death
come not on thee, nor thine...on me.

2469
03:26:29,800 --> 03:26:32,200
Heaven make thee free of it.

2470
03:26:32,400 --> 03:26:35,200
I follow thee.

2471
03:26:35,200 --> 03:26:37,400
I am dead, Horatio.

2472
03:26:40,000 --> 03:26:42,000
Wretched queen, adieu!

2473
03:26:44,200 --> 03:26:49,000
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,

2474
03:26:49,200 --> 03:26:55,000
that are but mutes or audience to this act,
had I but time -

2475
03:26:55,200 --> 03:27:01,200
as this fell sergeant, death,
is strict in his arrest - (WAILS) I could tell you...

2476
03:27:01,400 --> 03:27:03,400
But let it be.

2477
03:27:04,000 --> 03:27:07,600
Horatio, I am dead.

2478
03:27:08,800 --> 03:27:14,800
Thou livest. Report me
and my cause aright to the unsatisfied.

2479
03:27:15,000 --> 03:27:20,400
Never believe it. I am more an antique Roman
than a Dane. Here's still some liquor left.

2480
03:27:20,600 --> 03:27:24,000
As thou'rt a man, give me the cup. Let go!

2481
03:27:24,200 --> 03:27:29,200
Horatio, if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
absent thee from felicity awhile,

2482
03:27:29,400 --> 03:27:37,000
and in this harsh world draw thy breath
in pain to tell my story.

2483
03:27:37,200 --> 03:27:39,600
(DISTANT CANNONFIRE)

2484
03:27:39,800 --> 03:27:44,000
- What warlike noise is this?
- Young Fortinbras, come from Poland,

2485
03:27:44,000 --> 03:27:47,400
to the ambassadors of England
gives this warlike volley.

2486
03:27:47,600 --> 03:27:53,000
O, I die, Horatio.
The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.

2487
03:27:54,400 --> 03:27:57,600
I cannot live to hear the news from England,

2488
03:27:57,800 --> 03:28:02,600
but I do prophesy the election lights on Fortinbras.

2489
03:28:04,600 --> 03:28:07,800
He has my dying voice.

2490
03:28:08,000 --> 03:28:10,800
So tell him...

2491
03:28:11,000 --> 03:28:17,600
with the occurrents
more and less which have solicited...

2492
03:28:23,200 --> 03:28:25,400
The rest is silence.

2493
03:28:38,200 --> 03:28:41,400
Now cracks a noble heart.

2494
03:28:47,400 --> 03:28:51,000
Good night sweet prince,

2495
03:28:51,200 --> 03:28:53,800
and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.

2496
03:28:54,000 --> 03:28:56,800
(FANFARE AND DRUMS BEATING)

2497
03:28:57,000 --> 03:28:59,200
Why does the drum come hither?

2498
03:29:03,200 --> 03:29:05,400
Where is this sight?

2499
03:29:09,600 --> 03:29:12,600
What is it you would see?

2500
03:29:12,800 --> 03:29:16,600
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.

2501
03:29:16,800 --> 03:29:20,000
This quarry cries on havoc.

2502
03:29:22,600 --> 03:29:27,800
O proud death,
what feast is toward in thine eternal cell

2503
03:29:27,800 --> 03:29:33,600
that thou so many princes
at a shot so bloodily hast struck?

2504
03:29:33,800 --> 03:29:39,400
The sight is dismal,
and our affairs from England come too late.

2505
03:29:39,600 --> 03:29:43,200
The ears are senseless
that should give us hearing

2506
03:29:43,400 --> 03:29:46,000
to tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,

2507
03:29:46,200 --> 03:29:50,400
that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.

2508
03:29:50,600 --> 03:29:53,800
Where should we have our thanks?

2509
03:29:53,800 --> 03:29:58,000
Not from his mouth,
had it the ability of life to thank you.

2510
03:29:58,200 --> 03:30:00,800
He never gave commandment for their deaths.

2511
03:30:02,600 --> 03:30:07,400
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
you from the Polack wars

2512
03:30:07,600 --> 03:30:10,400
and you from England are here arrived,

2513
03:30:10,600 --> 03:30:15,800
give orders that these bodies
high on a stage be placed to the view,

2514
03:30:16,000 --> 03:30:20,400
and let me speak to the yet unknowing world
how these things came about,

2515
03:30:20,600 --> 03:30:24,200
so shall you hear of carnal,
bloody, and unnatural acts,

2516
03:30:24,400 --> 03:30:29,000
of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,

2517
03:30:29,200 --> 03:30:33,200
of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause

2518
03:30:34,400 --> 03:30:41,400
and, in this upshot, purposes mistook
fall'n on the inventors' heads.

2519
03:30:41,600 --> 03:30:43,600
All this can I truly deliver.

2520
03:30:43,800 --> 03:30:48,000
Let us haste to hear it.
Call the noblest to the audience.

2521
03:30:50,000 --> 03:30:54,400
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.

2522
03:30:55,600 --> 03:31:01,800
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.

2523
03:31:02,000 --> 03:31:09,800
Of that I shall have also cause to speak, and
from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.

2524
03:31:11,600 --> 03:31:15,600
But let this same be presently perform'd,
even while men's minds are wild,

2525
03:31:15,800 --> 03:31:18,600
lest more mischance on plots and errors happen.

2526
03:31:21,400 --> 03:31:26,000
Let four captains bear Hamlet
like a soldier to the stage,

2527
03:31:26,200 --> 03:31:31,600
for he was likely, had he been put on,
to have proved most royal.

2528
03:31:34,400 --> 03:31:42,200
And for his passage, the soldiers' music
and the rites of war speak loudly for him.

2529
03:31:50,000 --> 03:31:51,800
Take up the bodies.

2530
03:31:53,400 --> 03:32:00,000
Such a sight as this becomes the field,
but here shows much amiss.

2531
03:32:03,200 --> 03:32:06,000
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
