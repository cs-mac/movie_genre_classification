1
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:56,475
Driver.

2
00:01:57,675 --> 00:02:00,874
- Driver, stop!
- What type is in there?

3
00:02:02,273 --> 00:02:04,669
The man up there. He is bleeding
to death.

4
00:02:05,268 --> 00:02:07,466
We can't stop. Not here.

5
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,267
The brakes won't hold.

6
00:02:56,227 --> 00:02:58,226
Orderly, Orderly!

7
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,417
and just as guilty as a soldier would be.....

8
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:13,414
...who deserted his post under fire.

9
00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:16,011
Now in making an example of you, I....

10
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:25,204
I beg your pardon sir. I have some
wounded outside. I am looking for the...

11
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:29,802
Oh yes, yes, yes. You want the
Italian unit. We are the English unit you see.

12
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,397
- Yes number 207.
- They're in the other wing. Moved in today.

13
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,597
Yes out that way, straight ahead.

14
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:38,195
Thank-you Major.

15
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:12,367
What's the girl's friend been doing?

16
00:04:16,962 --> 00:04:18,563
Typical male conceit.

17
00:04:27,954 --> 00:04:29,353
I think they're going to send her
back home.

18
00:04:29,753 --> 00:04:31,551
It's a dirty shame.
She'll be disgraced.

19
00:04:31,552 --> 00:04:34,799
- It's the regulations.
- At least to have a baby here???

20
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:37,561
If they send her back now, all her friends will know.

21
00:04:37,596 --> 00:04:40,134
She's only herself to blame.

22
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:42,431
This is war, Fergie. And she loved him.

23
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,143
Shh, here they come.

24
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,337
Well, is it necessary for us all to be
here at one time? Get back to your post.

25
00:04:57,135 --> 00:05:01,532
You'll be packed and ready to leave
within the hour.

26
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:06,928
Molly.

27
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:11,925
Can I help pack.

28
00:05:12,924 --> 00:05:15,120
I guess so....if you want to.

29
00:05:16,118 --> 00:05:17,921
Why of course I want to.

30
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,517
- Good girls.
- I beg your pardon?

31
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:24,912
I say, she's the only human being in
the whole lot of us.

32
00:05:26,912 --> 00:05:30,110
I'm sorry Miss Barkley appears to
sympathize with one....

33
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:32,906
....that has disgraced the uniform
we all wear.

34
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,691
- Baby!
- Rinaldi!

35
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:55,689
Get away. You're filthy.

36
00:05:56,687 --> 00:05:59,085
You Anglo-Saxons. You're not to
clean yourself.

37
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:01,884
Did you bring me some good
kisses, baby? Did you have trouble finding us?

38
00:06:02,484 --> 00:06:03,283
No.

39
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:04,482
How do you feel? Is there going to
be an offensive?

40
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,478
Were you under fire? Madonna, but
I worried about you!

41
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:09,878
Yes, I can see how much you've
been worrying.

42
00:06:10,277 --> 00:06:13,873
I had 7 operations today baby and
one of them was beautiful.

43
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,271
I took the heart out.

44
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,270
It lay in my hand, and beat like this.

45
00:06:20,868 --> 00:06:23,465
You should have seen it. It was lovely.

46
00:06:24,065 --> 00:06:26,662
Soon Rinaldi will be the best
surgeon in all the court.

47
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:28,662
Then in all the army.....

48
00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:30,862
and some day, in all of Italy.

49
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,858
- Why not in all the world?
- Why not?

50
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:36,856
You will like it here baby.

51
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:38,853
What sort of a town is this?
Any girls?

52
00:06:39,155 --> 00:06:41,051
Many beautiful English nurses.

53
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:42,051
No, I mean girls.

54
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:44,101
Girls to, the house's full of them.

55
00:06:44,378 --> 00:06:45,275
Another villa Rosa?

56
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,613
Some of them have never been to the front before.

57
00:06:47,648 --> 00:06:48,773
perhaps...

58
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,077
but the nurses are much nicer

59
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:55,445
The most beautiful is Miss Barkley
I am in love with her.

60
00:06:55,644 --> 00:06:56,245
Does she know it?

61
00:06:56,644 --> 00:06:57,442
Not yet.

62
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:58,641
Have you any money?

63
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,839
- Yes.
- Lend me 50 lire.

64
00:07:01,441 --> 00:07:02,039
What for?

65
00:07:02,438 --> 00:07:05,636
I want to make on Miss Barkley the
impression of a man of sufficient wealth.

66
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:07,235
- All right.
- Thank-you.

67
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:10,031
You are my great and good friend
and financial protector.

68
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:11,232
And you're an ass.

69
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:14,828
Now we will eat and drink and I will
take you to meet Miss Barkley.

70
00:07:15,627 --> 00:07:18,025
But, you must make for me a good
impression upon her.

71
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:20,623
- Now listen......
- But you must.

72
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:22,624
And you can have a nurse too.

73
00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:26,618
There is another one named Miss
Ferguson. She is also very, very nice.

74
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:28,218
- No.
- No?

75
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:36,920
First we will eat and drink and then
we'll go and see the girls

76
00:07:38,716 --> 00:07:39,927
Yes.

77
00:07:51,617 --> 00:07:53,812
You know what an American is?

78
00:07:53,813 --> 00:07:54,813
yes

79
00:07:54,814 --> 00:07:55,813
What is it?

80
00:07:58,633 --> 00:07:59,347
She doesn't know.

81
00:08:01,094 --> 00:08:01,788
Well I'm an American.

82
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:03,893
Then what are you doing here?

83
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:06,549
Drinking, mostly.

84
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:07,886
He likes the uniform.

85
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:09,788
He's wrong.

86
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,127
I like them languages.

87
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:15,047
Then what were you doing in Italy?

88
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:16,980
Studying.

89
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:19,012
Studying what?

90
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,613
Architecture.

91
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,241
You know what that is?

92
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:25,229
Yes.

93
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:26,183
What?

94
00:08:29,574 --> 00:08:32,286
You see, she doesn't know.

95
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:36,032
Neither do I.

96
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:37,439
Oh, you've had too much wine.

97
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:42,583
It's filthy wine....it takes the enamel off your
teeth and leaves it on the roof of your mouth.

98
00:08:44,071 --> 00:08:45,277
- Where was I?
- Architecture.

99
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,171
Oh yes. Look.....

100
00:08:48,972 --> 00:08:49,771
.....I'll explain.

101
00:08:51,969 --> 00:08:54,968
This my dear, is called an arch....

102
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:48,124
The arch my dear, is perhaps the
oldest of architecturial devices.

103
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:50,720
Arch. Architecture.

104
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,118
The very word will tell you how
inextricably the two are one.

105
00:09:56,717 --> 00:09:57,517
In a word my dear.....

106
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:58,915
Architecture.....

107
00:09:59,514 --> 00:10:02,112
...is the most ancient of the arts.

108
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,208
You'd better put your shoe on,
you'll get cold feet.

109
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:15,603
If you please, I'd like to go now.

110
00:10:16,202 --> 00:10:17,602
The air raid seems to be over.

111
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:18,601
Catherine.

112
00:10:20,003 --> 00:10:20,800
Catherine.

113
00:10:22,598 --> 00:10:24,796
- Catherine.
- Here I am Fergie. I'm coming.

114
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:27,392
Oh, I was so worried.

115
00:10:28,193 --> 00:10:29,193
Did you think I'd been blown away?

116
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:31,191
I didn't know what to think. Nobody
saw where you went.

117
00:10:32,189 --> 00:10:32,990
Who's that man.

118
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:35,786
Oh, I don't know.
Some lunatic.

119
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,386
Come on.

120
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:50,775
What if we take the mountains to
the north. Behind them are more

121
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:55,772
and behind those more yet. And we
take them all only if the Austrians stop fighting.

122
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:57,969
One side of course will stop.

123
00:10:58,569 --> 00:11:01,366
- It will go on forever.
- Like him.

124
00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:15,157
No, no, no. It is not true.

125
00:11:15,556 --> 00:11:16,753
But you don't want us to attack?

126
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:20,752
If we must have war, I suppose we
have to attack.

127
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:23,149
But, so many die that way.

128
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,547
But what is death to a Christian.

129
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,336
Don't encourage him Fergie.

130
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:41,933
Frederico.

131
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:44,132
- You are back safe.
- Hello Father.

132
00:11:44,931 --> 00:11:47,131
- I am so glad.
- He prays and prays for you Frederico.

133
00:11:47,531 --> 00:11:49,128
Every time you go out the door, he
does the same.

134
00:11:49,728 --> 00:11:50,527
Oh, I pray for you all.

135
00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:53,323
You are late baby. How is it up
there? Quiet?

136
00:11:53,523 --> 00:11:54,722
You nearly missed the party.

137
00:11:55,723 --> 00:11:56,523
But it is very dull.

138
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:59,721
But Miss Barkley is her and her
friend Miss Ferguson.

139
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:02,318
The one you will like. Come.

140
00:12:07,115 --> 00:12:10,709
Miss Barkley, permit me to present
to you...

141
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,910
... my friend and war brother Lt. Henry.
He has just returned back from the front.

142
00:12:14,508 --> 00:12:15,506
How do you do?

143
00:12:16,307 --> 00:12:17,904
How do you do?

144
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,905
And this is Miss Ferguson.

145
00:12:21,104 --> 00:12:22,903
-How do you do?
- How do you do?

146
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,495
Now he begins again, that fellow.
Quick let us go into the garden.

147
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:49,080
Now, you stay here.

148
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,676
I will find something for us to drink.
Asti? Grappa? Vermouth?

149
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:56,075
- Which do you like?
- All of them.

150
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,874
Then you shall have them.

151
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:17,456
-Nice out here.
- Isn't it?

152
00:13:21,454 --> 00:13:23,652
We seem fated to bump into each
other in the dark.

153
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:28,048
I'm sorry about that. I mistook you
for someone else.

154
00:13:28,248 --> 00:13:29,447
So I gathered.

155
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:32,846
- I had been drinking.
- I gathered that too.

156
00:13:34,643 --> 00:13:35,841
- Mad?
- No.

157
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,640
- You're an American, aren't you?
- Yes.

158
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,838
Then what are you doing in the
Italian army?

159
00:13:42,637 --> 00:13:45,434
It's not really the army, it's only the
ambulance.

160
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,633
It's very odd. Why did you do it?

161
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:50,632
I don't know. Why did you?

162
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:52,427
Oh, I joined up in England.

163
00:13:53,028 --> 00:13:56,228
The fact is the boy I was engaged
to had gone across.

164
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:04,020
- Where is Miss Ferguson.
- Why don't you go and see?

165
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:07,618
Yes, do bring her out Captain
Rinaldi.

166
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:21,006
Have some?

167
00:14:21,605 --> 00:14:22,206
Thanks.

168
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:26,002
He's sore.

169
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:27,599
What for?

170
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,597
Because I'm here with you.

171
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:31,798
Women prefer him as a rule.

172
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:38,191
Shall we take a walk?

173
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:40,790
Yes, let's.

174
00:14:43,788 --> 00:14:45,984
- Where is he now?
- Who?

175
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:47,785
The boy you were engaged to.

176
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:49,383
He's dead.

177
00:14:50,782 --> 00:14:52,181
He was killed in Assam.

178
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:54,578
Were you engaged long?

179
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,778
Eight years. We grew up together.

180
00:14:57,377 --> 00:14:58,379
Why didn't you marry?

181
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:01,372
I didn't know what the war was like
then

182
00:15:02,972 --> 00:15:04,971
If I had to do over again, I'd marry him.

183
00:15:14,765 --> 00:15:17,362
When I joined up, I had this silly
idea that he may......

184
00:15:17,562 --> 00:15:19,559
.....come to the hospital where I was.

185
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:22,758
With a saber cut I suppose and a
bandage around his head.

186
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:26,155
Shot through the shoulder.
Something picturesque.

187
00:15:26,953 --> 00:15:29,551
This is a picturesque front. Not
France.

188
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:31,352
He didn't have a saber cut.

189
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:33,750
They blew him to bits.

190
00:16:21,908 --> 00:16:23,309
What are you thinking about now?

191
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:25,108
About whiskey.

192
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:27,305
What about whiskey?

193
00:16:27,705 --> 00:16:29,302
About how nice it is.

194
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:31,503
You're nice too.

195
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:38,296
No.

196
00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:39,494
- Why not?
- No don't.

197
00:16:40,095 --> 00:16:41,095
- Yes.
- No please!

198
00:16:48,088 --> 00:16:49,487
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?

199
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:50,686
It's all right.

200
00:16:51,486 --> 00:16:52,885
I'm dreadly sorry. Really.

201
00:16:54,683 --> 00:16:56,482
I just couldn't bear...

202
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,881
...the nurses' evening-off aspect of it.

203
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:01,677
It's quite all right. I don't mind at all.

204
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:04,074
Poor man.

205
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:08,073
You see......I've been leading a
funny sort of life.

206
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:11,469
Besides, you're so very beautiful.

207
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:14,468
You don't have to talk a lot of
nonsense, I said I'm sorry.

208
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:18,863
We could get along.

209
00:17:20,462 --> 00:17:21,460
Couldn't we?

210
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,860
You're sweet.

211
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:26,057
- No I'm not.
- Yes, you're a dear.

212
00:17:28,456 --> 00:17:31,053
I'd be very glad to have you
kiss me now, if you don't mind.

213
00:18:11,485 --> 00:18:12,775
Your are looking for someone?

214
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,067
Have you seen Miss Barkley?

215
00:18:14,102 --> 00:18:15,455
Miss Barkley?

216
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,225
Didn't she go out there with you?

217
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,326
With me?

218
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:19,586
No.

219
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:21,613
But just a little while ago?

220
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:27,228
I thought I saw her go out to the garden gate
with the lieutenant Henry.

221
00:18:27,263 --> 00:18:29,147
She went out with an officer?
Alone?

222
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:33,531
Well, perhaps I was mistaken,
you know it is quite dark out there.

223
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:34,486
Oh she wouldn't do that.

224
00:18:34,521 --> 00:18:37,473
No. No I am sure I was mistaken.

225
00:18:37,508 --> 00:18:39,544
Where is she then?

226
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:45,915
You're a real girl.

227
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,959
I'm a crazy girl.

228
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:48,817
What?

229
00:18:48,853 --> 00:18:50,569
with bad ??? ideals??

230
00:18:50,604 --> 00:18:52,284
It's nice
and enough.

231
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,040
It's nice. I suppose that has to be enough

232
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,911
for people who live as we live.

233
00:19:04,946 --> 00:19:08,135
Back home I'd have courted you and send you flowers.

234
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,767
Out here you crowd it all into one hour.

235
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:15,110
Not the way it's got to be, out here.

236
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:17,290
look,

237
00:19:20,456 --> 00:19:22,295
tomorrow morning I have to go to the front again.

238
00:19:23,573 --> 00:19:24,377
if a shell got me

239
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:26,893
and you never saw me again

240
00:19:29,808 --> 00:19:32,710
then we'd both be sorry that we've been so formal

241
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:34,208
waiting

242
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:38,258
besides, what's this so fine,
putting it off

243
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:39,510
dragging it out?

244
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,412
hearing the auditions ??? tonight

245
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,277
- you're so.... tomorrow
- no

246
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:44,900
no wait, no please...

247
00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:53,517
Catherine

248
00:19:55,815 --> 00:19:56,746
Catherine

249
00:20:00,988 --> 00:20:02,903
thank you for the lovely concert

250
00:20:02,938 --> 00:20:05,380
I hope you are not worried about Miss Barkley?

251
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:07,696
It's not like her to disappear this way.

252
00:20:07,731 --> 00:20:09,975
Perhaps if she felt ill and went home alone.

253
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:10,891
perhaps

254
00:20:10,926 --> 00:20:11,772
good night

255
00:20:22,823 --> 00:20:23,698
why didn't you tell me?

256
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:25,460
it doesn't matter.

257
00:20:25,495 --> 00:20:29,049
if it had to happen,
I'd rather it were like this.

258
00:20:29,084 --> 00:20:32,247
a new church out???
and those stars

259
00:20:32,282 --> 00:20:33,426
why not?

260
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:34,215
why not?

261
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,024
there's a war on.

262
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:39,504
and tonight who cares,
and tomorrow who knows.

263
00:20:42,828 --> 00:20:44,023
what did you say your name was?

264
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:45,940
stop it

265
00:20:51,621 --> 00:20:55,249
if you know how I was back home,
you'd feel very sorry.

266
00:20:56,879 --> 00:20:57,930
please, stop it

267
00:21:06,957 --> 00:21:09,370
we blame everything on the war,
but that's rot

268
00:21:09,405 --> 00:21:11,749
it's something in ourselves

269
00:21:16,883 --> 00:21:19,394
the lady sat in the public square

270
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:21,905
and mourned her lost innocence

271
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:24,930
don't be sorry

272
00:21:24,965 --> 00:21:26,863
I'm not

273
00:21:28,845 --> 00:21:29,643
I love you

274
00:21:34,024 --> 00:21:35,082
oh darling

275
00:21:57,129 --> 00:21:59,528
Did you have a nice time baby?

276
00:22:00,927 --> 00:22:02,925
You made progress with her, eh?

277
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:04,923
We're friends.
If that's what you mean?

278
00:22:05,322 --> 00:22:09,921
I mean...was she nice to you,
practically speaking?

279
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,621
Shut up!

280
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:13,616
I am a man of extreme delicacy, but
was she.....

281
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,416
Rinaldi! Will you please shut up.

282
00:22:17,215 --> 00:22:18,615
If you want to be a friend of mine,
shut up.

283
00:22:19,413 --> 00:22:21,011
I am your best friend and your war
brother.

284
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,409
Then shut up.

285
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:29,405
Miss Barkley prefers you to me.
That is very clear.

286
00:22:31,003 --> 00:22:33,802
But Miss Ferguson is very nice too.

287
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,599
Do you like her?

288
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:38,597
No!

289
00:23:10,225 --> 00:23:11,476
That you of all people...

290
00:23:12,765 --> 00:23:14,105
you're all geese, that's what you are

291
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,382
silly geese.

292
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:18,568
stop this bunk??? about woman's part in the war

293
00:23:18,603 --> 00:23:21,266
we must bring solace to the men who fight

294
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:23,685
sacrifice ourselves,
give ourselves

295
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,956
if you'd known him for a long time,

296
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:29,600
had been in love with him

297
00:23:29,635 --> 00:23:31,209
but you only met him tonight

298
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,098
How long must you know a man
before you can love him?

299
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:38,618
Are you pretending to be in love with that man?

300
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,073
I think I am.

301
00:23:42,908 --> 00:23:43,863
I must be.

302
00:23:43,898 --> 00:23:46,466
it couldn't have happened.

303
00:23:48,811 --> 00:23:50,191
you're just another humped up steam???

304
00:23:50,226 --> 00:23:51,517
one in a hundred

305
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,886
you'll probably never see him again.

306
00:23:57,191 --> 00:23:58,546
he said if he'd met me back home

307
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:00,674
he'd have courted me

308
00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:02,696
send me flowers

309
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:04,725
but now

310
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:09,543
I suppose I won't ever see him again

311
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:39,428
Howdy. Good luck.

312
00:25:21,594 --> 00:25:22,990
- Turn back.
- Back?

313
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,590
Yes, back!

314
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:58,162
- I want to see Miss Barkley.
- She's on duty.

315
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:00,963
Wait, don't go in there.

316
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:25,740
Why we come back here for?

317
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,341
Lt. knows what he's doing. Please.

318
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,336
- What's wrong?
- Aren't we going to get started here?

319
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:36,333
I thought you started. What are you
doing here?

320
00:26:36,933 --> 00:26:39,929
We come back Senor Capitano.
The Lt. forgot something.

321
00:27:02,113 --> 00:27:04,111
Hi....you're all right aren't you?

322
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,907
Yes, I'm all right.

323
00:27:07,907 --> 00:27:08,705
I came to..

324
00:27:09,705 --> 00:27:10,706
I thought.....

325
00:27:12,303 --> 00:27:13,104
...you see.

326
00:27:14,503 --> 00:27:16,499
I'm going to be away for a while..

327
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:20,897
...and I didn't want you to think that
I'd just gone away.

328
00:27:21,498 --> 00:27:22,496
No, I...

329
00:27:23,294 --> 00:27:24,095
What I mean is.....

330
00:27:25,093 --> 00:27:26,691
....I'd hate to have you feel that...

331
00:27:27,891 --> 00:27:29,690
it wasn't important to me..

332
00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:32,686
..about us.

333
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,285
I don't exactly know how to say it.

334
00:27:36,885 --> 00:27:38,883
You said it very nicely dear, thank-you.

335
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:42,477
No, no I didn't.

336
00:27:43,677 --> 00:27:45,478
- You mustn't feel.
- Will you be gone long?

337
00:27:47,075 --> 00:27:47,675
No.

338
00:27:48,674 --> 00:27:52,670
Only a few days. There's going to
be a show up above Plava.

339
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,869
A show? You'll be careful won't you?

340
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,865
I won't get hit.

341
00:27:59,065 --> 00:28:00,264
Hold this.

342
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:06,860
Here....

343
00:28:08,657 --> 00:28:09,856
It's a St. Anthony.

344
00:28:15,852 --> 00:28:19,449
They said St. Anthony is very
useful to guard you from harm.

345
00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:22,048
I'll take good care of him.

346
00:28:29,242 --> 00:28:30,441
But I wish I could kiss you.

347
00:28:46,829 --> 00:28:48,227
He is my friend and a good soldier

348
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,424
I would hate to see him lose his
head over a woman.

349
00:28:52,422 --> 00:28:53,622
Aren't you exaggerating a bit.

350
00:28:54,221 --> 00:28:55,021
I think not.

351
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,020
Couldn't we send her back to the
base, Major?

352
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:59,617
Oh, if you could send her away it
would simplify everything

353
00:29:01,216 --> 00:29:02,615
Could perhaps send her to Milan.

354
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:07,211
Excellent my dear Major.
Magnificent. No wonder the

355
00:29:12,808 --> 00:29:14,804
What did you say her name was?

356
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,097
We won't get anything else to eat,
once the attacks start.

357
00:29:26,295 --> 00:29:27,495
This is all they given me.

358
00:29:28,495 --> 00:29:29,894
Starting to eat the rations?

359
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:33,091
No, we'll all eat together. Come on
and sit down.

360
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:39,886
Thank-you.

361
00:29:40,285 --> 00:29:41,883
Here, you cut this.

362
00:29:52,274 --> 00:29:53,674
Here, take some cheese.

363
00:29:56,872 --> 00:29:58,670
Wash it down with wine.

364
00:30:00,668 --> 00:30:02,667
Who caused the attack?

365
00:30:18,453 --> 00:30:19,652
Bersaglieri.

366
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:24,649
If nobody would attack,
the war would be over.

367
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,435
420?
- No, 305...

368
00:30:42,035 --> 00:30:46,033
- It sounded like a Skoda to me.
- Skoda, that's what I say.

369
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:07,614
Lt.! Are you hurt?

370
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:10,211
My leg.

371
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:14,808
Both of my legs.

372
00:31:23,802 --> 00:31:27,596
Lacerations of the scalp and
possible fracture of the skull.

373
00:31:28,397 --> 00:31:32,015
Multiply superficial wounds of the
left and right thigh

374
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,976
......left and right knee and right
foot.....

375
00:31:35,011 --> 00:31:41,387
profound wounds of right knee and foot
in current line of duty. Next patient

376
00:31:53,577 --> 00:31:57,375
Lift him up on the table. Carefully.

377
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:14,164
How do you feel, baby?

378
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:18,356
Rinaldi. What are you doing here?

379
00:32:18,757 --> 00:32:19,955
Boneldo telephoned me.

380
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:22,554
The Major gave me permission to come.

381
00:32:24,353 --> 00:32:26,550
No one shall hurt you baby. I won't
let them.

382
00:32:27,151 --> 00:32:29,148
No butcher is going to touch my war
brother.

383
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:32,147
Only Rinaldi can take you and
never hurt you.

384
00:32:33,146 --> 00:32:34,942
You must forgive baby, for talking
so much...

385
00:32:36,142 --> 00:32:38,342
...but I am, I am very moved to see
you bodily wounded.

386
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,737
I will see that you are decorated for
bravery.

387
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:47,135
Perhaps we can you you the
medallio d'argento, but surely the bronze

388
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,133
I didn't carry anybody. I couldn't
move.

389
00:32:50,731 --> 00:32:52,529
Surely there was something very
heroic in what you did.

390
00:32:54,127 --> 00:32:56,128
I was blown up eating cheese.

391
00:32:59,124 --> 00:33:02,122
Don't worry baby. I will fix you so
that you are as good as new.

392
00:33:02,321 --> 00:33:06,319
You will see, everyday, I learn to
do things smoother, quicker.

393
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,115
Soon, very soon, you will be
walking again.

394
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,313
I brought a present for you.

395
00:33:13,313 --> 00:33:15,512
You will find it under your blanket,
next to your heart.

396
00:33:16,312 --> 00:33:18,708
It is a bottle of brandy baby. Very
good brandy.

397
00:33:19,507 --> 00:33:21,907
The infantry captured it from the
Austrians on San Gabrielle.

398
00:33:23,305 --> 00:33:24,504
I have another surprise for you.

399
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:26,303
Take a deep breath.

400
00:33:27,101 --> 00:33:28,500
Where do you think you will go from
here?

401
00:33:29,498 --> 00:33:32,697
To the Italian hospital where they
have the male nurses with the beards?

402
00:33:33,297 --> 00:33:33,896
No!

403
00:33:34,296 --> 00:33:37,093
I will arrange everything with my
friend, the British Major.

404
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:41,291
You will go to Milan. To the
beautiful Miss Barkley.

405
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,488
That makes you happy?

406
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,686
Poor Rinaldi. So alone with the
war...

407
00:33:47,686 --> 00:33:50,482
No one to make fun of. No one to
lend him money.

408
00:33:51,483 --> 00:33:55,680
While you are in Milan with the
beautiful Miss Barkley.

409
00:33:56,879 --> 00:34:00,274
Making love in Milan to the chaste
Miss Barkley.

410
00:34:23,057 --> 00:34:23,857
Look out for the step.

411
00:34:45,439 --> 00:34:46,637
Why do you stop?

412
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:50,435
I am superintendent. May I have
your medical papers please.

413
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:53,031
They're in my coat. In the
buttoned-down pocket.

414
00:34:55,629 --> 00:34:57,230
Take him up those stairs, down the
corridor.

415
00:34:57,628 --> 00:35:00,426
His room is the one at the end.
You show him Julio.

416
00:35:01,825 --> 00:35:02,823
Who are you?

417
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:07,621
I am the porter, Lt. Come follow me.

418
00:35:18,811 --> 00:35:20,611
Now Lt., we must lift you up on the bed.

419
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:24,608
- All right. But keep my legs straight.
- Yes, yes Lt.

420
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:29,202
Can I get you anything?

421
00:35:29,602 --> 00:35:32,002
- Get me some brandy.
- It is not allowed.

422
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,798
Wasn't I wounded, fighting for the
glory of Italy?

423
00:35:36,197 --> 00:35:38,395
- You'll find some money in my pocket.
- As you wish.

424
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,588
- So it's you!
- Ferguson.

425
00:35:47,388 --> 00:35:49,187
- Is Catherine here?
- As if you didn't know.

426
00:35:49,586 --> 00:35:50,786
I believe that's why you got
wounded.

427
00:35:51,186 --> 00:35:52,185
- Where is she?
-You ought to be still.

428
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,182
Here's your chart. I must take your
temperature.

429
00:35:55,581 --> 00:35:56,582
Does she know I'm here?

430
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,579
Under the arm please.

431
00:36:09,171 --> 00:36:10,770
- Hello darling.
- Catherine.

432
00:36:12,768 --> 00:36:13,567
You're lovely.

433
00:36:14,368 --> 00:36:15,567
- Are you badly hurt?
- You're lovely.

434
00:36:16,566 --> 00:36:19,762
- Oh my poor darling. It's your leg isn't it?
- You're the loveliest thing I ever saw.

435
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:26,556
I have to go now darling, I can't stay.

436
00:36:27,157 --> 00:36:28,954
- Will you come back?
- Later, but we have to be awfully careful.

437
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,955
- You've got to come back.
- I will, when I can.

438
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:33,352
- Tonight?
- I'll try?

439
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:35,549
Somebody's coming.

440
00:36:37,547 --> 00:36:38,546
Tonight.

441
00:36:44,343 --> 00:36:45,542
I'll take that thermometer now.

442
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,138
Good gracious.

443
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:53,335
Fetch the doctor.

444
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:57,133
It's a miracle you're not delirious
with such a fever.

445
00:36:57,932 --> 00:37:00,529
- I haven't got any fever.
- Stay quiet.

446
00:37:01,328 --> 00:37:02,727
It's not what you think.

447
00:37:28,106 --> 00:37:29,105
I've brought you a few little things.

448
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:32,105
And this is mosquito netting and
this is a bottle of vermouth.

449
00:37:32,504 --> 00:37:33,702
You like vermouth?

450
00:37:35,102 --> 00:37:37,100
- And these are English papers.
- Thank you for that.

451
00:37:38,098 --> 00:37:38,898
It was very good of you to come.

452
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,698
I mustn't stay long. They warned
me not to tire you.

453
00:37:42,296 --> 00:37:43,495
You seem very tired yourself.

454
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:45,892
I am tired. I have no right to be.

455
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:47,490
You have the war disgusted.

456
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,690
No, I hate the war.

457
00:37:51,489 --> 00:37:53,287
- I don't enjoy it.
- But you do not mind it.

458
00:37:53,886 --> 00:37:57,684
You do not see it. Oh, you must
forgive me. I know that you are wounded.

459
00:37:57,884 --> 00:37:58,882
That was an accident.

460
00:37:59,483 --> 00:38:01,082
Still even wounded, you do not see it.

461
00:38:01,681 --> 00:38:05,476
I can tell. I do not see it myself, but
I feel it a little.

462
00:38:06,677 --> 00:38:07,676
Come in Cath.

463
00:38:10,674 --> 00:38:12,271
Don't go yet Father. It's still early.

464
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:15,670
Are you sure. With the operation in
the morning, he should rest.

465
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,868
He's strong.

466
00:38:17,468 --> 00:38:19,464
He has a lovely temperature. It is
always normal.

467
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:21,663
I'm very proud of his temperature.

468
00:38:22,262 --> 00:38:24,062
Maybe all of our children will have
fine temperatures too.

469
00:38:24,463 --> 00:38:26,860
Our children will probably have
beastly temperatures.

470
00:38:28,658 --> 00:38:30,256
Don't mind us Father. We're in love.

471
00:38:31,455 --> 00:38:32,259
I know....

472
00:38:33,056 --> 00:38:34,655
I can see it in your faces.

473
00:38:35,653 --> 00:38:36,852
You approve, don't you, Father?

474
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:40,450
You spoke of children.

475
00:38:43,647 --> 00:38:47,443
This too is the war. Without the war,
you would have married in Gods grace.

476
00:38:50,641 --> 00:38:51,640
Is it not so?

477
00:38:56,035 --> 00:38:57,435
And you?

478
00:39:01,431 --> 00:39:03,430
I hadn't thought about it like that.
But...

479
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,027
yes, I suppose so.

480
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:27,811
Father, are you...

481
00:39:29,009 --> 00:39:30,208
Is that the marriage service?

482
00:39:49,903 --> 00:39:53,789
Don't you realize father
that army regulations prevent us from marrying?

483
00:39:56,135 --> 00:39:57,098
it's in Katano??

484
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,680
Poor chap.

485
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:13,277
It's such a crazy marriage.

486
00:40:13,877 --> 00:40:15,277
At least I'm in white.

487
00:40:18,075 --> 00:40:18,874
No orange blossoms.

488
00:40:19,273 --> 00:40:20,272
I can smell them.

489
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:23,668
No organ music.

490
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:24,870
I can hear it plainly.

491
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:43,249
It was a foolish notion perhaps.

492
00:40:44,306 --> 00:40:46,357
I have not the right to say you are married.

493
00:40:46,654 --> 00:40:48,251
Yet it has made me happy to do this.

494
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,052
For now, from my heart, can I say I
bless you in His name.

495
00:40:52,649 --> 00:40:53,848
Thank-you Father.

496
00:40:56,046 --> 00:40:57,443
Good-bye and be happy, both of you.

497
00:40:58,044 --> 00:40:59,044
Thank-you Father.

498
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,241
- Give my regards to the mess.
- I will.

499
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:07,439
And get well soon. I will come
again the next time I am in Milan.

500
00:41:08,237 --> 00:41:10,036
- Good-bye my dear.
- Good-bye.

501
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,805
Is Miss Barkley here?

502
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:23,470
no.

503
00:41:36,964 --> 00:41:37,664
Shut the door.

504
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:40,458
- But dear!
- please darling

505
00:41:50,001 --> 00:41:51,660
we mustn't do it.
your operation's in the morning.

506
00:41:51,695 --> 00:41:52,815
it's our wedding night.

507
00:41:54,432 --> 00:41:55,282
oh darling

508
00:41:58,124 --> 00:41:59,137
you'll have to take your oil.

509
00:41:59,172 --> 00:42:00,926
castor oil? no!

510
00:42:00,961 --> 00:42:02,100
you'll take it from me

511
00:42:02,135 --> 00:42:03,736
I'll take anything from you

512
00:42:05,261 --> 00:42:06,030
if you stay

513
00:42:08,797 --> 00:42:10,571
oh darling darling

514
00:42:10,606 --> 00:42:12,310
I want what you want.

515
00:42:12,346 --> 00:42:14,402
there isn't any me any more,
just what you want

516
00:42:14,437 --> 00:42:15,664
you're sweet

517
00:42:23,364 --> 00:42:25,541
when I think about the way...

518
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:26,274
such a lovely way

519
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:31,278
feel all we feel...

520
00:42:31,313 --> 00:42:33,862
no woman in my heart beat..

521
00:42:33,897 --> 00:42:36,469
I'm mad about you...

522
00:43:48,338 --> 00:43:51,839
That's the opera I made my debut in
at La Scala.

523
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:53,238
They threw benches at him.

524
00:43:53,637 --> 00:43:56,634
-That's a lie.
- Yes, they did. I threw six benches myself.

525
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,434
That's not funny.

526
00:44:04,428 --> 00:44:05,627
Oh now he is offended.

527
00:44:06,027 --> 00:44:08,627
He'll get over it. That's his sore
spot. We always tease him.

528
00:44:09,225 --> 00:44:12,022
- You don't care whom you hurt.
- Now don't you get mad too.

529
00:44:12,422 --> 00:44:14,621
Catherine and I were thinking of
asking you to our wedding.

530
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,018
Weren't we Catherine?

531
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:18,418
- You'll never get married.
- We will!

532
00:44:18,818 --> 00:44:20,815
No you won't.
You'll fight before you marry.

533
00:44:21,415 --> 00:44:22,613
- Oh, we never fight.
- You've time yet.

534
00:44:22,813 --> 00:44:23,813
We won't fight ever.

535
00:44:24,013 --> 00:44:25,011
You'll die then.

536
00:44:25,811 --> 00:44:28,209
Fight or die. That's what people do.

537
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:30,607
- They don't marry.
- Fergie...

538
00:44:33,205 --> 00:44:34,407
I'm not crying.

539
00:44:37,003 --> 00:44:38,402
Maybe you'll be all right, you two.

540
00:44:40,071 --> 00:44:41,340
Watch out you don't get her into trouble.

541
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:42,837
I won't get her into trouble.

542
00:44:42,872 --> 00:44:43,971
We've had enough.

543
00:44:44,006 --> 00:44:45,068
They'll kill you.

544
00:44:46,398 --> 00:44:47,397
Why, Fergie.....

545
00:44:48,595 --> 00:44:49,795
What is the matter with her?

546
00:44:50,793 --> 00:44:52,194
She doesn't like me, that's all.

547
00:44:52,593 --> 00:44:54,792
Oh no. She just likes me more.

548
00:45:02,184 --> 00:45:03,583
Are you on night duty tonight?

549
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,581
Yes, but you won't care.
You'll go right off to sleep.

550
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,980
You wait and see......

551
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:13,575
Darling.....how many other girls
have you ever loved?

552
00:45:14,373 --> 00:45:14,974
None.

553
00:45:15,373 --> 00:45:16,372
How many, really?

554
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,372
None.

555
00:45:19,371 --> 00:45:20,782
How many have you...

556
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:23,187
how do you say it?

557
00:45:23,222 --> 00:45:24,318
... loved?

558
00:45:25,366 --> 00:45:26,767
- None.
- you're lying to me.

559
00:45:28,165 --> 00:45:28,965
Of course.

560
00:45:29,364 --> 00:45:31,961
that's right, just keep on lying,
that's what I want you to do.

561
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:34,557
Were they pretty?

562
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,159
I've never been with anyone.

563
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:37,958
That's right darling.

564
00:45:39,754 --> 00:45:40,554
What were they like?

565
00:45:41,554 --> 00:45:42,353
I don't know anything about it.

566
00:45:43,355 --> 00:45:46,750
You're just mine. That's true.
You've never belonged to anyone else.

567
00:45:48,348 --> 00:45:49,747
I don't care if you have though. I'm
not afraid of them.

568
00:45:50,145 --> 00:45:51,544
Only don't tell me about them.

569
00:45:52,945 --> 00:45:54,344
You never told them you loved them
did you?

570
00:45:54,943 --> 00:45:56,942
- No.
- I knew you wouldn't.

571
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,938
-Oh darling, I do love you.
- Then, kiss me.

572
00:46:01,939 --> 00:46:03,537
- Right here on the street?
- Yes.

573
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:18,525
I'll go in first.

574
00:46:32,112 --> 00:46:34,111
What is this? If I may ask.

575
00:46:34,311 --> 00:46:35,512
What was in it.

576
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,307
That's Kümmel. That's the best kind. It comes
in those bear shaped bottles from Russia.

577
00:46:41,505 --> 00:46:42,303
And these.

578
00:46:43,905 --> 00:46:46,102
That's brandy, wine and whiskey.

579
00:46:46,701 --> 00:46:48,300
And I have been pitying you for
being wounded.

580
00:46:49,499 --> 00:46:51,496
Pity is something that is wasted on you.

581
00:46:51,696 --> 00:46:52,096
Thank you.

582
00:46:52,697 --> 00:46:53,896
If you're so anxious not to go back
to the front......

583
00:46:54,696 --> 00:46:56,494
.....I should think you'd try
something more intelligent.

584
00:46:57,093 --> 00:46:58,891
Not self-inflicted alcoholism.

585
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:00,888
- What?
- I said alcoholism.

586
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:05,487
And I also say, that I'll see you
convalescent leave is canceled.

587
00:47:07,084 --> 00:47:08,683
You'll go back to the front tomorrow night.

588
00:47:33,064 --> 00:47:34,862
Have I time for a drink before the
train leaves?

589
00:47:35,062 --> 00:47:36,062
- For the front?
- Yes.

590
00:47:36,462 --> 00:47:37,861
In about 20 minutes senor
Capitano.

591
00:48:09,367 --> 00:48:11,471
it's a fine room, a lovely room

592
00:48:11,506 --> 00:48:12,561
it's alright

593
00:48:12,596 --> 00:48:15,271
the red plush is just the thing.

594
00:48:15,306 --> 00:48:17,684
those mirrors are very attractive too

595
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:21,738
people who go in for vice
seem to have very good taste about it

596
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,664
you're a grand girl

597
00:48:23,699 --> 00:48:25,651
oh darling

598
00:48:28,553 --> 00:48:31,059
I wish you could do something really simple

599
00:48:31,094 --> 00:48:33,567
everything we do seems so innocent and right.

600
00:48:34,137 --> 00:48:35,938
You're a fine simple girl.

601
00:48:36,336 --> 00:48:39,534
I am a simple girl. Nobody but
you ever realized it.

602
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:41,931
At first, I thought you were a crazy
girl.

603
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:43,528
I was a little crazy at first.

604
00:48:48,527 --> 00:48:49,924
Is that your train?

605
00:48:50,124 --> 00:48:50,923
Maybe.....

606
00:48:51,523 --> 00:48:55,520
It makes a return. But it stays in the
station here until it is time to leave.

607
00:48:56,121 --> 00:48:57,519
There's really lots of time.

608
00:49:02,715 --> 00:49:07,111
But at my back, I always hear, time's
wicked chariot hurrying near"....

609
00:49:08,509 --> 00:49:10,908
I know that poem. It's by Marlowe.

610
00:49:11,262 --> 00:49:13,361
only it's about a girl
who wouldn't live with a man.

611
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:22,500
Listen.

612
00:49:29,096 --> 00:49:30,294
It's only the rain.

613
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,292
I hate the rain.

614
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:34,090
I like it.

615
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:35,688
I'm afraid of the rain.

616
00:49:36,491 --> 00:49:37,488
Afraid, why?

617
00:49:37,887 --> 00:49:38,687
I.....

618
00:49:39,486 --> 00:49:40,885
Oh, perhaps it's silly.

619
00:49:41,285 --> 00:49:42,083
What? Tell me.

620
00:49:42,483 --> 00:49:43,682
- No. Don't make me.
- Tell me.

621
00:49:45,284 --> 00:49:46,082
All right.,

622
00:49:47,681 --> 00:49:50,678
I'm afraid of the rain, because
sometimes I see me dead in it.

623
00:49:50,876 --> 00:49:51,475
No!

624
00:49:52,475 --> 00:49:54,074
And sometimes I see you dead in it.

625
00:49:55,474 --> 00:49:57,871
-Well that's more likely.
-Oh no darling, don't say that.

626
00:50:03,268 --> 00:50:04,467
That is your train.

627
00:50:06,265 --> 00:50:08,261
"Time's winged chariot".

628
00:50:14,657 --> 00:50:15,857
I'll come with you.

629
00:50:16,257 --> 00:50:19,655
No, please, I don't want you. Not
at the station.

630
00:50:20,254 --> 00:50:21,453
All right darling.

631
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:23,251
How often will you write?

632
00:50:23,451 --> 00:50:25,248
As often as I can. Do they read
your letters?

633
00:50:25,848 --> 00:50:27,446
They can't read English enough to
hurt anything.

634
00:50:27,846 --> 00:50:29,046
Well I'll make them very confusing.

635
00:50:29,646 --> 00:50:30,845
But not too confusing.

636
00:50:31,244 --> 00:50:33,043
Oh, I should have got you a going-
away gift.

637
00:50:33,243 --> 00:50:34,840
A whistle to make you feel better in
the dark.

638
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,439
Or a sword. I'm sure we could get
a used sword very cheap.

639
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:40,037
Swords aren't very useful at the
front.

640
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:42,435
Oh I see, they get in the way of
your legs when you are running.

641
00:50:43,233 --> 00:50:45,433
They might be useful at mess
though.

642
00:50:48,231 --> 00:50:49,829
I'm afraid I have to start, darling.

643
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:54,626
I hate to leave our fine house.

644
00:50:55,825 --> 00:50:56,824
So do I.

645
00:50:59,021 --> 00:51:01,618
We never stay settled very long in a
home, do we?

646
00:51:02,218 --> 00:51:03,219
We will.

647
00:51:05,217 --> 00:51:07,415
I'll have a fine home for you when
you come back.

648
00:51:09,014 --> 00:51:10,811
Say I'll come back to Catherine.

649
00:51:13,011 --> 00:51:14,210
I'll come back to Catherine.

650
00:51:21,803 --> 00:51:23,203
I'll always come back.

651
00:51:27,598 --> 00:51:29,998
Maybe this time, you'll be hurt just a
little in the foot.

652
00:51:30,996 --> 00:51:31,796
Or the lobe of the ear.

653
00:51:32,195 --> 00:51:34,194
Oh no. I want your ears just the
way they are.

654
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:36,190
Your feet have been hurt already.

655
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:44,089
I want a ticket to Switzerland
please.

656
00:53:44,488 --> 00:53:46,688
- Where Senora, to what town?
- The nearest one to Italy.

657
00:53:47,287 --> 00:53:49,285
- That would be Brissago.
- Then give me a ticket to Brissago.

658
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:50,483
All right.

659
00:53:52,081 --> 00:53:53,081
Oh Fergie, I was afraid you wouldn't
come.

660
00:53:53,281 --> 00:53:54,679
Would you mind telling me what this
is all about?

661
00:53:55,278 --> 00:53:58,031
- I'm going away.
- So I gathered by this, but where, why.....

662
00:53:58,066 --> 00:53:59,826
To Switzerland, to have a baby.

663
00:54:03,651 --> 00:54:04,796
I knew he's get you in trouble.

664
00:54:04,831 --> 00:54:06,254
it wasn't his fault

665
00:54:06,289 --> 00:54:07,331
what are you going to do about it?

666
00:54:07,366 --> 00:54:08,519
he doesn't know it.

667
00:54:08,554 --> 00:54:09,672
You didn't tell him?

668
00:54:10,271 --> 00:54:12,469
What would be the good. It would only
worry him and he would have to go anyway.

669
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:14,270
Aren't you going to tell him.

670
00:54:15,068 --> 00:54:17,865
Well, not yet.
I may write him from Switzerland.

671
00:54:19,265 --> 00:54:20,864
-You're a fool.
- Here Signora.

672
00:54:22,064 --> 00:54:23,263
- On track three.
- Thank-you.

673
00:54:24,062 --> 00:54:25,061
What's the hurry?
Why tonight?

674
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:26,459
I couldn't go back to that hospital.

675
00:54:27,257 --> 00:54:28,456
I couldn't stand it. Not with him
gone.

676
00:54:28,856 --> 00:54:31,854
- But you'll be all alone in Switzerland.....
- Now don't worry Fergie, I'll be all right.

677
00:54:35,053 --> 00:54:36,451
You're not afraid of anything are you?

678
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:39,049
Only of going back to that hospital.

679
00:54:40,449 --> 00:54:41,647
Don't scold me Fergie.

680
00:54:45,243 --> 00:54:46,642
I'll carry it.

681
00:55:23,813 --> 00:55:25,011
I've always told you I was a crazy girl.....

682
00:55:26,011 --> 00:55:27,609
I couldn't bear Milan while you were away.

683
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:30,410
So, I've chucked the war and come
to live in this little Swiss town....

684
00:55:30,808 --> 00:55:32,207
......as near as possible to the
Italian border.....

685
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,206
and you.

686
00:55:34,005 --> 00:55:37,001
And darling, it's an adorable place
and we'll be very happy here.

687
00:55:37,602 --> 00:55:38,600
I've taken a suite....

688
00:55:42,997 --> 00:55:44,796
....in the best hotel.

689
00:55:45,395 --> 00:55:50,592
And I am fairly wallowing in luxury.
The bed is Empire and fit for an empress.

690
00:55:51,591 --> 00:55:53,988
There is a maroon velvet carpet,
ankle deep.......

691
00:55:54,587 --> 00:55:56,787
....and a bathroom, or darling the
bathroom.

692
00:55:57,586 --> 00:56:00,183
It's a black marble, with silver
fittings.

693
00:56:01,582 --> 00:56:04,782
I've just dined in state, at my sitting-
room window.

694
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:09,776
From which there is a divine view
of the lake, shimmering in moonlight.

695
00:56:21,765 --> 00:56:24,365
I'm an awful liar darling.....

696
00:56:25,164 --> 00:56:28,560
It's not really a nice place at all. It's
mean, cheap and horrible.

697
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,358
But it doesn't matter where I live....

698
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,357
....because I don't really live at all,
when I'm not with you.

699
00:56:36,354 --> 00:56:37,553
Darling....

700
00:56:40,153 --> 00:56:42,749
What I really want to tell you is...

701
00:56:43,549 --> 00:56:46,745
......I shall lie awake in the dark and cry
because you are not here.

702
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,545
I'm lonely and frightened.

703
00:56:51,142 --> 00:56:52,341
And I love you.

704
00:57:05,334 --> 00:57:06,531
-Hurry baby.
- Why?

705
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:08,528
- It's time to go.
- Go where?

706
00:57:09,127 --> 00:57:11,925
But I told you before to the Villa
Rosa. New girls. Everybody is going.

707
00:57:12,325 --> 00:57:13,124
No, not me.

708
00:57:13,523 --> 00:57:16,722
But you must. It will be a fine party
and besides I said that you would go.

709
00:57:17,521 --> 00:57:18,918
I can't. I've got to write a letter.

710
00:57:20,518 --> 00:57:24,516
To that little......everyday, more
letters. You might as well be married.

711
00:57:25,115 --> 00:57:25,914
That's my business.

712
00:57:26,914 --> 00:57:30,310
Oh baby. How are you ever going
to come back to me?

713
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:34,907
Serious, like a shopkeeper with a
liver. Where is my war brother, who

714
00:57:35,107 --> 00:57:36,904
......and go to the Villa Rosa every night?

715
00:57:38,104 --> 00:57:39,102
Leave me alone, will you?

716
00:57:41,103 --> 00:57:43,101
Why? Isn't she just a girl?

717
00:57:44,499 --> 00:57:45,498
Keep her out of this.

718
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:49,096
Secrets. Believe me baby.....

719
00:57:49,697 --> 00:57:52,493
...secrets subjects are not good for
soldiers.

720
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:56,489
Why don't you be like me? All fire
and smoke.

721
00:57:57,091 --> 00:57:58,089
And nothing inside.

722
00:57:59,088 --> 00:58:01,486
- Come on baby.
- You're drunk, stop it.

723
00:58:02,085 --> 00:58:05,082
Of course I am drunk. You come
with me and you will be drunk too.

724
00:58:05,684 --> 00:58:06,882
Come on baby.

725
00:58:07,882 --> 00:58:10,877
Oh, I am sorry. Now you must
come. There is no more ink.

726
00:58:12,076 --> 00:58:13,874
Get your hands off me and get out!

727
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:21,069
Poor baby....

728
00:58:21,669 --> 00:58:24,069
Tomorrow I will get you drunk,
and I will take out your liver

729
00:58:24,669 --> 00:58:27,664
...and I will put you in a good Italian
liver and make a man of you again.

730
00:58:29,063 --> 00:58:30,061
Ciao baby

731
00:58:41,455 --> 00:58:43,053
You're going out Senor Capitano?

732
00:58:44,052 --> 00:58:45,051
Yes, why?

733
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:47,048
The mail just came, Senor
Capitano.

734
00:58:47,448 --> 00:58:49,448
You censure it.

735
00:58:50,646 --> 00:58:52,644
Senor Capitano.....the officers' mail too?

736
00:59:09,431 --> 00:59:11,828
- Aren't you going to open them
Senor Capitano? - No!

737
00:59:12,428 --> 00:59:13,427
I'm in a hurry.

738
00:59:31,613 --> 00:59:33,812
- Send this one back.
- Yes, Senor Capitano.

739
00:59:34,411 --> 00:59:36,410
I do not like to see himself lose his
head over a woman.

740
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:38,806
Yes Senor Capitano.

741
01:00:01,791 --> 01:00:04,187
And today my letters came back.
Everyone that I'd ever written to her.

742
01:00:04,585 --> 01:00:05,385
Came back?

743
01:00:05,784 --> 01:00:08,184
Just marked return to sender.
Person unknown.

744
01:00:08,584 --> 01:00:09,782
Well, that's very strange.

745
01:00:10,381 --> 01:00:13,778
-32 letters. She never got one.
- Well, that's why she never wrote you.

746
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:17,776
No, she'd have written me anyway.
Something's happened to her.

747
01:00:18,176 --> 01:00:20,973
- Have you tried......
- I can't get any information at all.

748
01:00:21,372 --> 01:00:23,971
- I've got to go and find her, myself.
- Now, can you?

749
01:00:24,971 --> 01:00:26,369
I'm going to Milan.
I'll find her.

750
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:30,165
Leave of absence forbidden
since that battle in the north again.

751
01:00:30,564 --> 01:00:32,565
- I'm going anyway.
- that's desertion.

752
01:00:34,164 --> 01:00:36,361
- I don't care, I'm going.
- You'll be caught.

753
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,158
- You mustn't do this Frederico
- Yes I must.

754
01:00:40,157 --> 01:00:41,757
That's what I wanted to tell you padre.

755
01:00:42,756 --> 01:00:44,355
What does this war mean to me
anymore?

756
01:00:44,754 --> 01:00:46,351
What does anything mean, but
finding her.

757
01:00:46,751 --> 01:00:49,349
- But Frederico, consider the.......
- I can depend on you padre?

758
01:00:54,346 --> 01:00:56,543
Say good-bye to Rinaldi and the
others for me.

759
01:00:57,343 --> 01:00:58,345
- When are you leaving?
- Now.

760
01:00:59,144 --> 01:01:02,340
While they are at dinner. And by
morning when they miss me, I'll be

761
01:01:03,538 --> 01:01:05,535
If they ask me.....what do I
say...what....

762
01:01:05,935 --> 01:01:06,734
Anything you like.

763
01:01:08,135 --> 01:01:10,532
- Good-bye Father.
- Good-bye Frederico.

764
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:12,930
May the Lord bless and preserve
you.

765
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:30,027
What are you doing in the yards?

766
01:07:30,427 --> 01:07:32,226
- Looking for stragglers.
- What do you do with them?

767
01:07:32,625 --> 01:07:34,023
Send them back to fight invaders.

768
01:07:34,623 --> 01:07:37,223
Every foot of Italian soil must be
regained.

769
01:07:37,622 --> 01:07:39,820
- Suppose they don't want to go back?
- Then we shoot them?

770
01:07:59,203 --> 01:08:00,002
Who's there?

771
01:08:00,802 --> 01:08:01,602
Where's Catherine?

772
01:08:03,202 --> 01:08:05,399
- What are you doing back here?
- Where's Cathy?

773
01:08:06,397 --> 01:08:09,795
I know you. You run away. You're a
deserter.

774
01:08:10,196 --> 01:08:12,794
- Where is she? I've got to see her.
- You can't. She's gone.

775
01:08:13,795 --> 01:08:16,190
- Gone! Where?
- You'd better get out.

776
01:08:19,188 --> 01:08:20,189
Has she been transferred?

777
01:08:20,787 --> 01:08:23,385
If you don't get out of here, I'll
scream and bring the whole

778
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:25,982
- Why'd she go. Where? Tell me.
- No!

779
01:08:27,183 --> 01:08:28,484
Tell me where she is!

780
01:08:28,493 --> 01:08:30,687
go ahead and choke me, but I won't tell,
you've done her enough harm.

781
01:08:30,722 --> 01:08:32,022
what do you mean?

782
01:08:32,057 --> 01:08:33,409
I said you'd get her into trouble.

783
01:08:33,444 --> 01:08:34,604
I hate you.

784
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:36,277
I hate you, understand? I won't tell
you anything.

785
01:08:38,075 --> 01:08:39,676
I hope they catch you.
I hope they shoot you.

786
01:08:40,674 --> 01:08:43,470
To pay you back for what you've
done to her. Making her have a baby.

787
01:08:45,671 --> 01:08:46,269
Baby?

788
01:08:46,669 --> 01:08:49,266
I warned you, but you didn't care.
Not about her.

789
01:08:49,865 --> 01:08:51,663
- Now she's had to go away.
- Where?

790
01:08:52,062 --> 01:08:53,663
Where? For pity's sake, tell me.

791
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:54,863
- Fergie!
- No!

792
01:08:55,262 --> 01:08:57,060
No, no!

793
01:09:07,251 --> 01:09:12,049
And get me some clothes. A full
outfit. I can't go around in this uniform.

794
01:09:13,047 --> 01:09:15,245
As long as I don't get mixed up in it
myself.

795
01:09:15,645 --> 01:09:19,643
You won't. I just want you to get
some things and put an

796
01:09:20,042 --> 01:09:22,440
I really oughtn't to, if I had any sense.

797
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:27,234
I know I shall have awful gas pains
in the morning as a result of this.

798
01:09:27,638 --> 01:09:28,435
Just say......

799
01:09:29,434 --> 01:09:32,031
Catherine, where are you?

800
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:34,829
I am free at last.

801
01:09:36,231 --> 01:09:38,827
Meet me at the Palace Hotel,
Stressa.

802
01:09:40,226 --> 01:09:41,624
Signed Frederic.

803
01:10:12,401 --> 01:10:17,594
The Major made an obituary
speech in your memory and the

804
01:10:18,793 --> 01:10:20,593
Vermouth. One for you?
Two vermouth.

805
01:10:21,392 --> 01:10:22,991
You see, we all thought you were
dead.

806
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:27,787
It never occurred to us that you
could be shell-shocked, wandered

807
01:10:28,388 --> 01:10:29,586
How did you find me?

808
01:10:30,785 --> 01:10:32,583
I saw your advertisement in the paper.

809
01:10:33,781 --> 01:10:39,619
But as soon as we knew, we arranged everything.
Rinaldi will work on you, one of his miraculous cures.

810
01:10:39,654 --> 01:10:39,978
You will go back a hero.

811
01:10:40,576 --> 01:10:41,975
I'm not going back.

812
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:44,373
They will decorate you for bravery.
They will even promote you.

813
01:10:45,773 --> 01:10:46,772
No!

814
01:10:47,771 --> 01:10:49,570
I'm through the war. Get that
straight.

815
01:10:50,567 --> 01:10:53,366
But you can't do that. You can't say
I am through with the war.

816
01:10:53,565 --> 01:10:54,167
They will not let you do that.

817
01:10:54,765 --> 01:10:55,566
Two vermouth.

818
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:06,556
- Can I speak to you a moment sir?
- It's all right Harry, he's my friend.

819
01:11:06,955 --> 01:11:07,953
I.......

820
01:11:08,553 --> 01:11:11,952
He keeps telling me it is dangerous
for me to stay here any longer.

821
01:11:11,953 --> 01:11:16,733
The policeman was in tonight.
He spoke of notifying the carabiniere.

822
01:11:16,768 --> 01:11:19,748
- When will they come?
- Tonight, tomorrow , who knows......but soon.

823
01:11:21,144 --> 01:11:22,942
My boat is still ready sir.

824
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:25,939
Thank-you Harry.

825
01:11:28,137 --> 01:11:29,937
If they arrest you, no one can save you.

826
01:11:30,538 --> 01:11:32,134
- I know that.
- They will shoot you.

827
01:11:32,735 --> 01:11:36,531
Look! Get this through your head,
I'm not going back!

828
01:11:37,732 --> 01:11:40,330
I'm going to wait here until I can find
Catherine.

829
01:11:42,127 --> 01:11:43,526
And how do you expect to do that?

830
01:11:44,924 --> 01:11:46,325
I've got some people looking for her.

831
01:11:47,722 --> 01:11:50,320
- If that is more important than......
- She's going to have a baby.

832
01:11:52,518 --> 01:11:53,518
My baby.

833
01:11:59,312 --> 01:12:01,511
So. That means everything to you.

834
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:04,508
Yes, it would.

835
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:07,307
It means that I got to find her...

836
01:12:08,106 --> 01:12:09,105
... and get her out of Italy.

837
01:12:09,904 --> 01:12:12,903
- Perhaps she's no longer in Italy.
- What makes you say that?

838
01:12:14,301 --> 01:12:15,500
She is in Switzerland.

839
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:17,498
Where?

840
01:12:18,297 --> 01:12:19,496
- Brissago.
- Brissago?

841
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:22,494
Harry!

842
01:12:45,975 --> 01:12:46,976
Will you do one for me too?

843
01:12:48,176 --> 01:12:49,574
Yes madame. Step around here.

844
01:12:52,871 --> 01:12:56,041
No. Just the head please.

845
01:13:30,942 --> 01:13:32,339
Isn't there any mail for me yet?

846
01:13:33,138 --> 01:13:36,536
Ah, madame. Yes, yes today there
are letters.

847
01:13:37,135 --> 01:13:38,536
- Many letters.
- Many!

848
01:13:39,535 --> 01:13:42,132
- 20.
- 20! Well that was worth waiting for....

849
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:24,100
It is across the lake. Off course,
about 55 km.

850
01:14:24,498 --> 01:14:25,097
I'll make it.

851
01:14:25,896 --> 01:14:27,695
- But at the frontier, there will be sentries.
- I know.

852
01:14:28,293 --> 01:14:30,094
And you will have to watch out for
patrol boats. I will.

853
01:14:30,494 --> 01:14:33,290
- If it blows too hard......
- I won't drown.

854
01:14:35,688 --> 01:14:36,887
Have you enough money? Here.

855
01:14:40,284 --> 01:14:40,885
Won't you need it?

856
01:14:41,884 --> 01:14:43,682
There must be a Villa Rosa in Ponte None.

857
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:48,280
Always the same girls, until they
become like old friends. Like war comrades.

858
01:14:48,679 --> 01:14:50,077
Take it baby, please, please.

859
01:14:51,077 --> 01:14:51,675
You're a good egg.

860
01:14:52,874 --> 01:14:56,272
No, I am not a good egg. I am a
fool.

861
01:14:57,672 --> 01:15:00,867
But, if I had understood how you felt
about her......

862
01:15:02,267 --> 01:15:03,666
Good luck baby.

863
01:15:19,053 --> 01:15:20,452
Ciao baby.

864
01:15:27,047 --> 01:15:28,445
It doesn't work.

865
01:15:28,847 --> 01:15:32,043
- Should I get a new cylinder doctor?
- It is a new cylinder.

866
01:15:34,042 --> 01:15:36,838
Oh I wanted so to have this baby
and not make any trouble....

867
01:15:38,841 --> 01:15:40,837
....and now I'm all done... All
gone to pieces.

868
01:16:05,217 --> 01:16:07,215
She is losing strength fast doctor.

869
01:16:07,615 --> 01:16:09,014
There's no use. I'll have to operate.

870
01:16:12,809 --> 01:16:14,410
That was lovely.....

871
01:16:16,209 --> 01:16:19,605
...Frederic....darling.....

872
01:16:24,602 --> 01:16:25,999
You mustn't worry darling.

873
01:16:27,598 --> 01:16:29,197
I'm not going to die now.

874
01:16:31,996 --> 01:16:35,791
I got past the place where I was
going to die.

875
01:16:39,502 --> 01:16:40,584
practically.

876
01:16:40,989 --> 01:16:43,786
Of course you are not going to die.
You mustn't think about it.

877
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:29,149
- Is she going to be all right?
- Are you her husband?

878
01:17:29,348 --> 01:17:29,747
Yes.

879
01:17:30,347 --> 01:17:32,747
She kept calling for you all night. lt
would have been better if you'd been here.

880
01:17:33,345 --> 01:17:34,944
I'm sorry.....is she in danger?

881
01:17:35,543 --> 01:17:37,941
- She is very weak.
- Do you suppose I could see her now?

882
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:40,141
- Later......later.
- It won't be long.

883
01:18:20,508 --> 01:18:21,706
You can't die.

884
01:18:24,705 --> 01:18:25,704
Did you call?

885
01:18:30,299 --> 01:18:32,300
No, I didn't say anything.

886
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,479
Not yet.

887
01:18:57,077 --> 01:18:58,877
- Is she all right?
- I hope so.

888
01:18:59,476 --> 01:19:00,077
The baby?

889
01:19:00,476 --> 01:19:03,073
A boy, but it was already dead
before she ever came in here.

890
01:19:03,871 --> 01:19:05,071
But she'll be all right?

891
01:19:05,671 --> 01:19:07,471
That's not in my hands any longer.

892
01:19:10,467 --> 01:19:13,264
Go across the street and get
yourself some breakfast.

893
01:19:14,064 --> 01:19:15,264
You look as if you need it.

894
01:19:15,664 --> 01:19:17,662
It will be some time before she can
see you.

895
01:20:10,829 --> 01:20:13,227
You've had children?
What was it like?

896
01:20:13,826 --> 01:20:15,426
I beg your pardon? What did you say?

897
01:20:18,624 --> 01:20:22,546
Nothing. Some coffee please
and a brioche.

898
01:20:32,812 --> 01:20:34,810
It's in the papers. Italy has won.

899
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:36,409
Thank God it's over.

900
01:20:36,609 --> 01:20:38,006
This is the beginning of the end....

901
01:20:39,006 --> 01:20:42,803
....but it will be a long time before
they can rebuild.

902
01:20:44,402 --> 01:20:46,599
In the early morning hours of
November 4th.....

903
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:51,197
the Austrio-Hungarian supreme command....

904
01:20:51,797 --> 01:20:54,793
..accepted the armistice conditions laid down
by the General Badoglio.

905
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:58,590
Don't let her die.

906
01:21:00,788 --> 01:21:03,386
Oh God, please don't let her die.

907
01:21:04,385 --> 01:21:06,984
I'll do anything for you, if you don't
let her die.

908
01:21:08,383 --> 01:21:10,981
You took the baby......that was all
right..

909
01:21:11,579 --> 01:21:13,377
...but don't let her die.

910
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:19,973
Please, please dear God, don't let
her die.

911
01:21:45,952 --> 01:21:47,351
Her husband's out there.

912
01:21:49,148 --> 01:21:50,549
Might as well let him in.

913
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,544
I knew he was coming.

914
01:21:58,342 --> 01:22:00,341
When I went under, I knew he was here.

915
01:22:05,135 --> 01:22:06,335
You won't tell him will you?

916
01:22:07,536 --> 01:22:08,335
Tell him what?

917
01:22:10,333 --> 01:22:11,332
That I'm going to die.

918
01:22:15,129 --> 01:22:17,928
- No, we won't tell him.
- Thank-you.

919
01:22:21,322 --> 01:22:22,323
Doctor......

920
01:22:24,722 --> 01:22:25,920
...have I long?

921
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:34,913
Don't you see?

922
01:22:36,114 --> 01:22:37,311
I have to know.

923
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:39,908
Not long.

924
01:22:46,902 --> 01:22:47,902
Let him come in.

925
01:22:49,701 --> 01:22:50,901
No wait.

926
01:22:53,299 --> 01:22:56,294
Could I have my bag first?

927
01:23:07,887 --> 01:23:09,486
Such a mess.

928
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,879
He never liked me to be pale.

929
01:23:27,072 --> 01:23:28,270
You can go in now.

930
01:23:43,458 --> 01:23:45,457
- Catherine.....
- Darling......

931
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:55,248
- You're all right?
- I'm fine.

932
01:23:56,446 --> 01:23:57,646
Did you worry about me?

933
01:23:59,447 --> 01:24:02,243
I came as soon as I found where
you were.

934
01:24:02,643 --> 01:24:03,241
Poor darling.....

935
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:05,838
Let me look at you.

936
01:24:09,636 --> 01:24:11,236
You're wet and tired.....

937
01:24:12,234 --> 01:24:14,232
Sit down now darling.....here.....

938
01:24:21,626 --> 01:24:23,225
You're going to be all right
Catherine.

939
01:24:31,218 --> 01:24:33,017
Do you want me to do anything
Cat?

940
01:24:34,417 --> 01:24:36,416
- Can I get you anything?
- No.

941
01:24:37,816 --> 01:24:39,211
Just talk to me.

942
01:24:40,011 --> 01:24:42,209
Tell me that you haven't stopped
loving me.

943
01:24:43,009 --> 01:24:45,607
You know I couldn't stop.

944
01:24:46,207 --> 01:24:48,006
I like to hear you say it though.

945
01:24:48,804 --> 01:24:50,203
I'll never stop loving you.

946
01:24:50,802 --> 01:24:51,803
Never?

947
01:24:53,003 --> 01:24:54,001
Not even....

948
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,197
..if I died.

949
01:24:58,357 --> 01:24:59,602
Never!

950
01:25:04,205 --> 01:25:06,561
You'd never do odd things with any other girls

951
01:25:06,596 --> 01:25:08,534
or say the same things, would you?

952
01:25:09,742 --> 01:25:10,609
never

953
01:25:10,792 --> 01:25:12,590
I want you to have other girls.

954
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:14,988
I don't want them.

955
01:25:16,386 --> 01:25:17,586
That's right dear.

956
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:26,380
Try to sleep, Cat.

957
01:25:32,373 --> 01:25:33,572
When I get well......

958
01:25:36,572 --> 01:25:38,369
...we'll take a little house in the
mountains....

959
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:42,967
We always planned a house of our
own, remember?

960
01:25:43,966 --> 01:25:45,564
I'll get you a fine house.

961
01:25:47,363 --> 01:25:49,560
We'll live in it until the war is over.

962
01:25:51,759 --> 01:25:55,556
Then you'll go back to America and
be a splendid architect.

963
01:25:57,353 --> 01:25:59,952
We'll be married all over again......in
a church.

964
01:26:00,952 --> 01:26:02,351
In a church.

965
01:26:05,348 --> 01:26:06,346
Darling.....

966
01:26:07,545 --> 01:26:08,543
....I'm going to die.

967
01:26:09,945 --> 01:26:11,743
- Don't let me die.
- Cat!

968
01:26:12,741 --> 01:26:15,539
Take me in your arms, hold me
tight.

969
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:18,138
- Don't let me go........
- Catherine.

970
01:26:18,738 --> 01:26:20,136
It's dark out there alone.

971
01:26:20,937 --> 01:26:23,732
I don't want to leave you anymore.
I've been alone so much.

972
01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:29,928
You can't die. You're too brave to die.

973
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:38,521
You're a fine girl. A brave girl.

974
01:26:39,919 --> 01:26:41,118
Yes...I....

975
01:26:41,918 --> 01:26:43,517
...I am a brave girl.

976
01:26:43,917 --> 01:26:45,916
Whatever happens, you'll not be
afraid.

977
01:26:47,115 --> 01:26:48,712
I'll not be afraid.

978
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:52,910
We've never been apart. Really.
Not since we met.

979
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:55,508
Not since we met.

980
01:26:56,307 --> 01:26:57,305
We never can be.

981
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:01,303
- Never parted.
- In life and in death.

982
01:27:02,102 --> 01:27:03,101
Say it, Cat!

983
01:27:04,499 --> 01:27:08,696
In life and in death, we'll never be
parted.

984
01:27:11,095 --> 01:27:13,293
You do believe that? Don't you, Cat?

985
01:27:16,090 --> 01:27:16,889
I believe it...

986
01:27:19,489 --> 01:27:20,888
....and I'm not afraid.

987
01:28:09,849 --> 01:28:10,847
Peace.......

988
01:28:14,016 --> 01:28:14,200
Peace
