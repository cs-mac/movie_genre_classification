Well, what's protocol, then?

492
00:35:32,094 --> 00:35:33,426
Protocol?

493

This mountain is still moving.

00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,267
I've been a miner
for 25 years!

495
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:43,468
I've seen 5 collapses!

496
00:35:44,673 --> 00:35:48,376
You know how many
men we saved?

497
00:35:48,378 --> 00:35:50,210
No one!

498

tell us anything?

499

<i>Yes.</i>

Lunchtime.

I think we should
wait for everyone.

522
00:37:05,534 --> 00:37:07,534
Why?

523
00:37:07,536 --> 00:37:08,903
- I'm hungry.
- YONNI: Dario.

524
00:37:08,905 --> 00:37:11,873
This food is for an emergency.

525
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:15,275
So, what is this, Yonni?
A picnic?

526
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:16,177
Take it easy.

527
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:17,845
I'm going to eat, Yonni.
Come on.

528
00:37:17,847 --> 00:37:20,148
- Dario... Use your head.
- I want you to move.

529
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,450
- Dario! Hey!
- Move!

530
00:37:24,222 --> 00:37:25,420
Come on!

531
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:28,925
Look at this crap.

532
00:37:28,927 --> 00:37:31,225
Works for me.

533
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,167
You knew, didn't you?

534
00:37:39,405 --> 00:37:41,206
You knew they never
finished the ladders.

535
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:43,175
You knew this place
was a deathtrap

but you let us come down
anyway, Lucho.

Listen.

538
00:37:50,786 --> 00:37:53,720
I asked Castillo
about the ladders.

539
00:37:53,722 --> 00:37:56,657
I asked him again and again.

540
00:37:56,659 --> 00:37:58,592
He had the certification!

You took the food!

550
00:38:23,956 --> 00:38:25,425
What are you doing, Dario?

551
00:38:25,427 --> 00:38:28,025
- Having lunch.
- Oh, having lunch?

552
00:38:28,027 --> 00:38:29,961
You're having lunch?

Let me tell you.

00:38:47,315 --> 00:38:49,885
- There is no ladders to climb.
- Yeah.

561

just caved in.

We are buried alive.

567

That is the big deal.

00:39:07,172 --> 00:39:11,008
This is all the food we have
left to keep us alive.

569

ration it carefully!

here until we are rescued!

Do you hear any drills?

573
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,060
That's because
they're not drilling for us.

574
00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:32,498
We're too far down.

575

It took 100 years for them
to dig this deep.

<i>How long do you think
that's going to take?</i>

577
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,911
<i>Do you think
the owners are going</i>

578
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:44,447
<i>to spend that kind of money?</i>

579
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:48,250
They didn't even
finish the ladders!

580
00:39:57,697 --> 00:40:00,264
They'll wait three days,

581
00:40:01,635 --> 00:40:04,802
then close the mine
and put up the gravestones.

I don't believe that!

585

They'll dig us out!

With their bare hands,
if it's necessary!

I believe we'll make it
out of here

It's your problem.

00:40:54,629 --> 00:40:56,161
Yep.

00:40:58,634 --> 00:41:00,366
Yeah. That's the way.

get here pretty quick.

Yep. Give me.

There's 18 cans of tuna.

598
00:41:07,444 --> 00:41:09,911
165 grams a can.

599

GOLBORNE: <i>Early today, the
mining company's rescue team</i>

608
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,961
<i>made an attempt
to enter the mine.</i>

609
00:41:52,963 --> 00:41:55,296
<i>Through the
ventilation chimneys.</i>

610
00:41:55,298 --> 00:41:57,100
<i>But, a secondary collapse</i>

611
00:41:57,102 --> 00:41:59,200
<i>blocked off
any possible access to it.</i>

612
00:41:59,202 --> 00:42:01,801
<i>The mining company has now
relinquished control.</i>

<i>The Chilean government is

619

that we can't afford
to fall on our asses

Sougarret. Andre Sougarret.

628
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,411
I'm your new chief engineer.

629
00:42:40,682 --> 00:42:42,149
Says who?

630
00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:43,718
The President.

631
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,555
Now, assuming they're alive,
we got 33 men down there.

632
00:42:47,557 --> 00:42:50,024
They are running out
of food and water.

633
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:52,160
<i>But there is adequate air.</i>

634
00:42:52,162 --> 00:42:53,695
<i>We know that they can survive</i>

635
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:55,832
for a period of time if
they are relatively healthy,

636
00:42:55,834 --> 00:42:57,432
but we don't know that.

637
00:42:57,434 --> 00:42:59,370
Some of them could be injured.

638
00:42:59,372 --> 00:43:03,041
Some of them are in the early
or later stages of silicosis.

639
00:43:03,043 --> 00:43:04,975
<i>Miner's lung disease.</i>

640
00:43:04,977 --> 00:43:09,448
What I do know, is that if we
don't get them up fast,

641
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:12,449
we're going to be
bringing up 33 corpses.

642
00:43:13,722 --> 00:43:15,253
<i>Here's what we know.</i>

643
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:18,858
<i>The men were working
in the lower half of the mine</i>

644
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,561
<i>when it collapsed.</i>

645
00:43:20,563 --> 00:43:24,064
That puts them here,
at the refuge.

646
00:43:24,066 --> 00:43:26,033
A 5 meter-wide space

647
00:43:26,035 --> 00:43:28,635
200 stories down.

648
00:43:28,637 --> 00:43:30,305
<i>My readings indicate</i>

649
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:33,609
<i>that a massive rock
displaced itself here.</i>

650
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:37,280
We're talking about
700,000 tons of diorite.

651
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:39,347
<i>Or twice the mass</i>

Obviously,

654
00:43:44,624 --> 00:43:49,961
we can't go in through the
front door, so to speak.

655
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:51,930
So we're going
to have to drill.

656
00:43:51,932 --> 00:43:53,798
Best case scenario,

657
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,333
we reach them in eight days.

658
00:43:59,508 --> 00:44:00,975
Eight days?

659
00:44:00,977 --> 00:44:02,975
They're too far down,
too deep.

660
00:44:02,977 --> 00:44:04,378
Eight days?

661
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,077
But that's not
the biggest problem.

662
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,849
It's the deviation factor.

663
00:44:07,851 --> 00:44:10,617
Look. Here's the refuge.

664
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:13,787
If you run these drills
24 hours a day

665
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:15,791
at full speed,

666
00:44:15,793 --> 00:44:20,729
the drill is going
to deviate, like this.

667
00:44:20,731 --> 00:44:22,231
Or like this.

668
00:44:22,233 --> 00:44:25,467
In fact, it can bend
20 different ways.

669
00:44:26,905 --> 00:44:30,240
And even if everything goes
according to plan,

670
00:44:30,242 --> 00:44:32,407
the odds are still
going to be against us.

What I'm saying, Minister,

673
00:44:42,423 --> 00:44:45,691
is that there's a less than
1% chance of finding them.

674

The drill bit fractured

Forgive her for everything
