1
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:05,996
Auntie, you're wearing lipstick!

2
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,230
Nosey kid!

3
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:09,239
Scram!

4
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:37,625
Papa, Aunt Jewel has no clothes on!

5
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,136
What?

6
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,147
Where's Mama?

7
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,345
Hiding.

8
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,183
Why are you dressed like that?

9
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:43,158
I'm going out with Mama.

10
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,729
No way.
Just change it.

11
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,594
-Just this once.
-Just do it.

12
00:07:58,043 --> 00:07:59,010
Where's Mama?

13
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,476
I haven't seen her.

14
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:02,376
-Join us.
-No, thanks.

15
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:04,949
Mama's attending a hearing today.

16
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,542
We'll never see the end
of that hearing.

17
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,653
Will you buy groceries today?

18
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,280
DO NOT ENTER

19
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,473
Alan?

20
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,180
Alan?

21
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,985
It's already the afternoon.
Go buy Clorox.

22
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:28,976
No wonder it smells here.

23
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,556
Have you seen Mama?

24
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,163
Mama.

25
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,531
What are you doing here?

26
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,261
The lawyer's here.

27
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:28,107
If your Papa gets acquitted,
I'll damn your brother to hell.

28
00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:30,340
Mama.

29
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:33,818
I'm the aggrieved party here,

30
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:40,518
and yet he testified in favor
of his bastard father.

31
00:12:41,693 --> 00:12:43,752
And you...

32
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,832
You also want him acquitted,
don't you?

33
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:52,665
Mama, leave the decision
to the court.

34
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,740
The attorney is waiting.

35
00:12:57,342 --> 00:13:01,608
He cheated on me,
and you're siding with him.

36
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:04,614
I'm not siding with anyone.

37
00:13:04,716 --> 00:13:08,914
He's my father,
so I don't want him to go to jail.

38
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:16,127
Even though he left us
for his mistress,

39
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:19,857
you still don't want him
to go to jail?

40
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:28,505
Nayda, your father
is not exempt from the law.

41
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:33,176
I've talked with Judge Animas.

42
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:37,215
He is not going to acquit him.

43
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,779
He's fair.

44
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,320
He's not corrupt.

45
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:50,855
You'll be disappointed if your father
goes to jail, won't you?

46
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,513
-Give me some more rice.
-More rice, sure.

47
00:15:05,637 --> 00:15:10,506
Attorney, do you think
Mama Flor's going to win?

48
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:14,101
I haven't lost a single court case.

49
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:20,652
If Papa Edwin lost the case,
how many years would he face?

50
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:24,984
Possibly 2 years and a half in prison.

51
00:15:25,857 --> 00:15:28,121
Is that a wig?

52
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,661
Attorney?

53
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,269
You haven't had breakfast yet?

54
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,472
Hi. How are you?

55
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:57,220
Mama, why don't you eat?

56
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:59,415
I don't want to eat.

57
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,956
-Don't lose your eyeglasses.
-I won't, Mama.

58
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:08,032
I'm already full.

59
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:12,359
It's bad to leave leftovers
on your plate.

60
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,598
Let's go!

61
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:21,970
Nayda, El Lobo might call
about depositing the check.

62
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,547
Don't let the check bounce.

63
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:25,138
Do we have enough cash?

64
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,014
Call up the lender.

65
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,385
Come, Grandson,
give Grandma a kiss.

66
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:37,890
Grandma, is Grandpa going to jail?

67
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:40,889
We'll see.

68
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:41,998
Let's go.

69
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,330
Jewel, come on!

70
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,836
Are you ready?

71
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,465
Mama, the attorney didn't pay
for his food again.

72
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:17,865
That freeloading attorney!

73
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:20,267
To think that he charges Mama
too much for every hearing,

74
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,669
and he doesn't pay for his food.

75
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:22,762
What did he have?

76
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:26,469
2 sausages, 1 coffee, and 1 egg.

77
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,307
-Finish your milk.
-I don't want it anymore.

78
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:29,937
Finish it!

79
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:32,448
Did you know that if your father
loses the case,

80
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,519
he'll get 2 years in jail?

81
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:36,917
Get going.
The boy is late for school.

82
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,081
Come on! Let's go!

83
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,886
Lando!

84
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:43,290
-Here.
-Give me a kiss, Mama.

85
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,455
Here, put this on.

86
00:18:23,568 --> 00:18:25,627
Miss Nayda.

87
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,331
Where's Alan?

88
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,431
I sent him on an errand.

89
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,238
Can I have a Coke?

90
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,877
Merly, aren't you supposed
to be at work?

91
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,644
I've quit.

92
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,514
Why?

93
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:44,747
Jobs are scarce these days.

94
00:18:44,856 --> 00:18:49,520
I can always go back
to the restaurant any time.

95
00:19:33,204 --> 00:19:35,331
Hello.

96
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:38,239
Here.

97
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,879
What are you doing here?

98
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,813
Why didn't you see me last night?

99
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,783
I was working all night.

100
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:50,948
Have you told Auntie Flor?

101
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,354
Not yet.

102
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:56,551
When are you going to tell her?

103
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:59,721
I'm waiting for the right time.

104
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,561
When is the right time?

105
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,797
Leave it to me.

106
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:10,824
Son of a bitch!

107
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,606
Hello! Good morning!
Yes, sir.

108
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:20,973
What check?

109
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,173
El Lobo.
Go ahead and approve it.

110
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,648
I will deposit before clearing.

111
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:29,015
Yes, thank you.
Thank you.

112
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,416
I just washed it last night
and now you're wearing it?

113
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:33,616
Don't you have 2 of those?

114
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,090
The other one is a different color.

115
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,093
-Give it to me!
-Stop it!

116
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,992
Stop arguing!

117
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,462
You asshole! It's mine!

118
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,658
Mr. Singh?
This is Nayda.

119
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:48,000
Can I borrow 10,000 pesos, please?

120
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,267
The check is going to clear soon.

121
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,842
Yes.

122
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:56,941
-Miss Nayda!
-Yes, sir. Thank you.

123
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:02,882
Miss Nayda,
Alan and Ronald are fighting!

124
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:06,115
Hey, stop that!

125
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:09,057
What are you fighting about?

126
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,219
Stop that!

127
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,591
Stop it!

128
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:14,562
Fuck you!

129
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,099
Fuck you, too!

130
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,897
That's my shirt!
Fuck you!

131
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:20,061
You're an asshole!

132
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:21,832
You're an asshole, too!

133
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,068
You've got plenty of clothes!

134
00:22:25,176 --> 00:22:26,700
Why are you siding with him?

135
00:22:26,811 --> 00:22:28,108
I'm not siding with anyone!

136
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,204
That's enough!
Why aren't you cleaning up?

137
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:31,612
It's not even dirty.

138
00:22:31,716 --> 00:22:33,377
Go clean up!

139
00:22:34,285 --> 00:22:35,684
Get him!

140
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,312
He's a thief!

141
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:46,562
Merly! Merly!

142
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:48,927
Merly!

143
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:52,928
Fuck you!

144
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,903
Get back here!

145
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:01,878
You lazy asshole!

146
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,175
Hey, come here!

147
00:23:12,323 --> 00:23:13,819
Stop him!

148
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:16,792
Stop! Stop him!

149
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:20,888
Get him!

150
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:23,124
He's coming up!

151
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,060
Stop!

152
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:31,401
You lazy asshole!

153
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:33,807
Give that back to me!

154
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,013
Stop!

155
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,543
Fuck you!

156
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,951
-Stop him!
-Get him!

157
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,921
Hurry up!

158
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:59,167
Ronald! Alan!

159
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,534
Did you get him?

160
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,176
Hey! Hey!

161
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,906
Fucking thief!

162
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:12,107
Get away from me!

163
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,685
Stop, or I'll shoot!

164
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,254
Get him up.

165
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,922
Fuck you!

166
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,391
Get him!

167
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,762
What, you're gonna fight?

168
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,233
We're gonna beat you up.

169
00:26:38,262 --> 00:26:39,320
Ouch!

170
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,727
It hurts.

171
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,663
Slowly.

172
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:46,203
My boil, it hurts.

173
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,907
Let's switch positions.

174
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,639
Move here.

175
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,032
It feels good.

176
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:22,429
Wait, I think my boil burst.

177
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:25,024
Looks like it's bleeding.

178
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:32,332
Stop, don't touch it.

179
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:42,385
Are you okay?

180
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,785
Are you tired?

181
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:19,985
Service?

182
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,388
How much?

183
00:29:21,492 --> 00:29:22,857
300.

184
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,694
Too expensive.
I don't have that much money.

185
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,791
How about 200?

186
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,531
Do you do anal?

187
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:37,199
How about a blowjob?

188
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:48,741
I want a full service.

189
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:52,353
Service?

190
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:56,019
Service?

191
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:01,826
Sir, it's really cheap.
Blowjob?

192
00:30:05,836 --> 00:30:09,135
Follow me to the hotel.

193
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,003
Yes, sir.

194
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:13,133
I'll text you the room number.

195
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:16,372
I'll tell the receptionist
I've got company.

196
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,505
Okay, sir.

197
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,017
Don't stand me up.

198
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:22,880
Wait.

199
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,683
I've got an emergency message.

200
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,657
I'm sorry, my grandma
just had an asthma attack.

201
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,719
-Next time.
-Okay.

202
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,189
Hey, who texted?

203
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,631
The Captain, he wants to see me.

204
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:40,260
Really? Ask him if he wants an orgy.

205
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:43,169
You're crazy!
He's conservative.

206
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,435
Walk nicely.
You are so gay!

207
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:47,238
There you go!

208
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:50,906
Here's Peter.

209
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,573
There, they are waiting for you.

210
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:53,945
Did you miss me?

211
00:30:54,051 --> 00:30:56,110
Of course!

212
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,551
-How's it going?
-I'm okay.

213
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:17,502
Leaving already?

214
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:19,671
Yes, Ma'am.

215
00:31:54,745 --> 00:31:57,407
So now you're crying?

216
00:31:59,283 --> 00:32:02,343
What should I do?

217
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,523
Go home.

218
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:11,956
Why don't you want to tell
Mama Flor?

219
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:18,732
Alan.

220
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:24,633
By the way, fix the bathroom.
It's backed up.

221
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:26,334
Okay.

222
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:08,716
Ronald, you are such a slob.

223
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:10,684
How many times
do I have to tell you

224
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:13,052
not to mix your dirty clothes
with ours?

225
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,124
I'm getting fed up.

226
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:16,386
I'm sorry.

227
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,291
I heard that you fought with Alan.

228
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:21,126
Well, he took my shirt.

229
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:25,168
You're both Zenaida's relatives,
you shouldn't fight.

230
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,238
-You should be ashamed.
-I am.

231
00:33:28,372 --> 00:33:29,703
I don't know about Alan.

232
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:33,743
Next time you should settle
your fights over drinks.

233
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:39,645
Later on tonight, let's celebrate
when Mama Flor wins.

234
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,513
Sure.

235
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,291
So what's your drama, bitch?

236
00:33:49,393 --> 00:33:51,327
Let's go.

237
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:23,323
Go. I've got work to do.

238
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,337
Use the ladies' room.

239
00:34:40,444 --> 00:34:42,412
It stinks!

240
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,286
Miss Nayda.

241
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,386
Did you and Alan fight again?

242
00:35:32,496 --> 00:35:34,794
I'm pregnant.

243
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:37,657
Just as I thought.

244
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:39,998
-Hey, your change.
-2 sticks of cigarettes, please.

245
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,072
-2?
-Yes.

246
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:44,299
Have you told Alan?

247
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:46,569
Yes, I did. A week ago.

248
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:51,580
It's almost 3:00.
Get Lando to pick up Jonas.

249
00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:54,040
What did he say?

250
00:35:54,151 --> 00:35:57,157
He said he'd talk to Mama Flor,

251
00:35:57,601 --> 00:36:00,647
but he hasn't talked to her yet.

252
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:03,283
Mama is attending a hearing.

253
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:07,228
Miss Nayda, please talk to Alan.

254
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:11,834
No, you two should tell Mama.

255
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:20,505
BEDMATES

256
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:26,310
FROLIC IN THE WATER

257
00:36:30,487 --> 00:36:33,547
This movie theater is still open?

258
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:35,215
Let's look at what's showing.

259
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,554
Maybe something lewd!
Let's go!

260
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,389
Lewd, of course.

261
00:36:38,495 --> 00:36:41,794
"Frolic in the Water."
That's crazy!

262
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:42,797
Let's go in, quick!

263
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,462
And what do you expect
to watch here? Disney movies?

264
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:46,565
Stupid fags.

265
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,368
Mother, double-time!
Our fairy godmother, quick!

266
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:52,533
You faggots! As if you're
going to run out of dicks!

267
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:56,306
Come on, faster.
Your dick is always slow.

268
00:36:56,413 --> 00:36:59,422
Always expect the gays here

269
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:03,012
when they're not at the beauty parlor.

270
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,917
5, 5, 5, fast!

271
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:06,751
Mama, the moolah, quick!

272
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:09,792
Here, it's what you're good at.

273
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:11,053
The tickets, quick.

274
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:14,494
I expected you last week.

275
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:18,399
Well, you know,
we've been so busy.

276
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,770
It's up there.
Sister, the boys kept me fully booked.

277
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,102
Just drop the tickets in the box.

278
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,937
You were gone for a long time.

279
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:28,671
A boy kept asking for you.

280
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,144
-A boychick?
-Yes.

281
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:32,010
I've passed him on to Ed.

282
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:35,210
Miss Nayda, I'll tend the ticket box.

283
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,049
Okay, enjoy!

284
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:53,099
Are you the owner, Ma'am?

285
00:37:53,203 --> 00:37:54,500
May I help you?

286
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,199
We'd like to ask a favor from you.

287
00:37:57,307 --> 00:38:00,470
Can we go in?

288
00:38:00,577 --> 00:38:02,010
Is there a problem?

289
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:05,104
A favor, please.
Can we go in?

290
00:38:05,215 --> 00:38:07,115
We have no money for tickets.

291
00:38:07,217 --> 00:38:08,775
We don't grant free entries here.

292
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:13,721
We're not going to watch the movie.
I'll just look for my son.

293
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,255
How old is your son?

294
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,384
16.

295
00:38:17,494 --> 00:38:19,223
Minors are not allowed entry here.

296
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:22,321
I heard he tags along
with the homosexuals to gain entry.

297
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:25,630
That's their business, not yours.

298
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:28,603
I'm certain your son isn't here.
We don't admit minors here.

299
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:31,402
You're bothering us.
There's a customer waiting.

300
00:38:31,508 --> 00:38:33,203
Okay?

301
00:38:34,144 --> 00:38:36,612
How many?

302
00:38:58,168 --> 00:39:01,535
Queenie, you're early today!

303
00:39:01,638 --> 00:39:04,300
Bitch!

304
00:39:05,175 --> 00:39:08,474
Babe, we've run out
of watermelon seeds.

305
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,570
Okay, I'll buy some later.

306
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:17,143
The corn nuts.
Buy the corn nuts from Mrs. Sally.

307
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:18,744
Most vendors get their supply
from her.

308
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,721
Why do you want corn nuts?

309
00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:24,260
I crave it.
Maybe I'm the one who is pregnant.

310
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:25,453
Knock it off.

311
00:39:25,562 --> 00:39:28,554
I'm just being sweet.

312
00:39:56,326 --> 00:39:58,920
Papa, I did good in math.

313
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:01,224
10 x 1 = 10.

314
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:02,798
10 x 2 = 20.

315
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,367
10 x 3 = 30.

316
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,333
Repeat that to your Mom.

317
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,461
Did you eat your snack?

318
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,369
Yes, I finished it.

319
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:11,964
So what did you buy
with your money?

320
00:40:12,075 --> 00:40:13,872
I bought bubble gum.

321
00:40:13,977 --> 00:40:18,641
-Did you get the change?
-Yes, 2 pesos.

322
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,087
Uncle, Jerome texted.
Papa's acquitted.

323
00:40:59,189 --> 00:41:00,781
Cousin Flor lost the case?

324
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,223
How fortunate for Papa.

325
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:05,056
How unfortunate for Auntie.

326
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:08,325
Lando, Papa's acquitted.

327
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,832
Mama, my teacher gave me this.

328
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:12,629
I got the math right.

329
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:13,998
-Really?
-Yes, Mom.

330
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,696
Show me how you did it.

331
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,798
10 x 1 = 10.

332
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,343
10 x 2 = 20.

333
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:24,243
10 x 3 = 30.

334
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:26,111
Very good.

335
00:41:26,216 --> 00:41:28,081
Take your bath.

336
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:29,685
Jonas!

337
00:41:29,786 --> 00:41:31,686
Scrub yourself well.

338
00:41:31,788 --> 00:41:33,517
Why must I always take a bath?

339
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:37,185
Because you always stink.
Go now.

340
00:41:50,974 --> 00:41:52,407
Are you studying, too?

341
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:54,909
No, sir.

342
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,240
Fool!

343
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:06,313
When I die...

344
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:13,457
...I want to be cremated.

345
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:20,661
And throw the ashes...

346
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,204
Wait, give me 150 pesos first.

347
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:25,366
Just wait, I'm not done yet.
Later.

348
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:46,521
Leave before somebody sees us.

349
00:43:46,723 --> 00:43:50,853
Shit, you didn't even come.
You left me hanging.

350
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,766
Jonas, take your bath.

351
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:03,999
Later, Mama.

352
00:44:04,107 --> 00:44:05,836
Do as I say! You stink!

353
00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:08,204
Do as I say!

354
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:10,642
Do as I say!

355
00:44:10,747 --> 00:44:13,648
It didn't fit my mouth.
He shot a big load.

356
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,082
I almost choked.

357
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:18,677
It's good you didn't choke.

358
00:44:25,328 --> 00:44:26,761
Was the fag here?

359
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,830
What fag?

360
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,167
Jonas saw the 2 of you.

361
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,566
That one?
It was nothing.

362
00:44:33,703 --> 00:44:35,034
You call that nothing?

363
00:44:35,138 --> 00:44:37,231
This is not a whorehouse.

364
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:40,867
It's nothing.
It's just for fun.

365
00:44:41,511 --> 00:44:44,378
It's bad for the business.

366
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:30,412
Nayda, there you are!

367
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,455
What are you doing here?

368
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:39,522
Uncle, why did you marry a girl?

369
00:46:40,263 --> 00:46:41,924
I want to be a father.

370
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:44,000
Besides, Susan loves me.

371
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:49,697
For a change,
I'm the one being loved.

372
00:46:52,842 --> 00:46:54,776
You're laughing at me?

373
00:46:54,911 --> 00:46:58,278
I'm laughing at myself.

374
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:02,382
I'm a nursing graduate,

375
00:47:03,381 --> 00:47:08,222
what the hell am I doing here?

376
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,283
Why are you looking for me?

377
00:47:10,393 --> 00:47:12,327
Cousin Flor is back!

378
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:15,159
Why didn't you say so?

379
00:47:15,865 --> 00:47:17,833
Oh, my gosh!

380
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,236
Mama!

381
00:47:30,413 --> 00:47:31,675
Where is she?

382
00:47:31,781 --> 00:47:35,478
In the kitchen
talking to Alan and Merly.

383
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:41,348
If I didn't get pregnant,
I wouldn't have gotten married.

384
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,085
Mama!

385
00:47:43,793 --> 00:47:45,351
Mama!

386
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:53,567
Alan!

387
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:55,933
Speak up!

388
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,563
You jerk!

389
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:00,700
You got a woman pregnant
without thinking.

390
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:05,645
Can you afford to feed
another mouth?

391
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:10,519
Your wages can't even support
your vices!

392
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,554
Idiot!

393
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:18,022
You shameless fool!
What an ingrate you are!

394
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:21,534
I took you in, gave you shelter

395
00:48:21,908 --> 00:48:25,364
and a job so you can have
a decent live.

396
00:48:25,468 --> 00:48:28,528
Can't you wait for the proper time?

397
00:48:29,739 --> 00:48:33,140
Here's another problem.

398
00:48:33,943 --> 00:48:41,850
I'm neck-deep in troubles
and here you bring another.

399
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,447
Look at me! Look at me!

400
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:54,520
What? Are you passing
this responsibility on to me?

401
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:57,191
The movie house
is going bankrupt!

402
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,734
Our 2 movie houses
have closed down.

403
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:02,999
This one is all we've got now.

404
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:05,639
And you're having a kid?

405
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:08,404
Where the hell will I get the money
to feed all of you?

406
00:49:08,511 --> 00:49:10,706
Tell me where...

407
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:14,477
I'll get a job after I give birth.

408
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:18,212
You're another one.

409
00:49:18,321 --> 00:49:21,916
How could you let this idiot
impregnate you?

410
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:26,086
You think he's got money
because he's my relative?

411
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:27,891
All of them are dirt poor!

412
00:49:27,997 --> 00:49:30,363
As poor as rats!

413
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,661
Mama, please don't shout.

414
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:34,828
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!

415
00:49:56,426 --> 00:50:02,524
You, do your parents know
your condition?

416
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:05,032
Not yet.

417
00:50:09,205 --> 00:50:12,106
Then tell them.

418
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:15,582
Come back on Sunday, and

419
00:50:16,105 --> 00:50:19,012
we'll talk about the wedding.

420
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:21,276
Thank you very much.

421
00:50:21,384 --> 00:50:23,318
Yeah, right.

422
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:27,322
All right.
You can go home now.

423
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,813
SEEDLING

424
00:50:56,986 --> 00:51:00,979
YOUNG SCREW PINE

425
00:51:11,901 --> 00:51:16,463
Mama, I'll do that later.

426
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:20,070
Many of them are already dry.

427
00:51:22,278 --> 00:51:25,679
Has the El Lobo check
been deposited?

428
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:30,310
Yes. There was a long line
at the bank.

429
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:41,255
Wish life were this simple.

430
00:51:46,035 --> 00:51:50,335
This one's wet.

431
00:51:56,012 --> 00:52:00,847
This one's dry.

432
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:10,156
This one, half-wet, half-dry.

433
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:16,331
Mama, your shoes got wet!

434
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:19,162
Oh, my!

435
00:52:20,069 --> 00:52:22,367
They're still new.

436
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:27,538
It's only now
that I'm wearing them again.

437
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:38,286
Mama.

438
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:01,510
That fucking judge!

439
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,578
He acquitted your father.

440
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:18,520
Okay, watch me.

441
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:22,758
Swing your hips like this.

442
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:23,898
There you go.

443
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,632
Hey, fag.
Your boobs.

444
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:27,999
You prick, I'm gonna suck you dry.

445
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:29,799
Chest out. Like that.

446
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:33,137
-1, 2...
-Hey, stop teaching her that--

447
00:53:33,242 --> 00:53:35,073
Hey, stop meddling.
Don't mind them.

448
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:37,271
Just follow me.

449
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,075
Come on!

450
00:53:41,584 --> 00:53:43,051
Come on, fag, just follow me!

451
00:53:43,152 --> 00:53:44,414
See, it's really easy!

452
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,886
Chin up! Chest out!
Sway your hips some more!

453
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:50,482
Oh, boy, what a dumb girl you are!
Come on, move your fucking ass!

454
00:53:50,593 --> 00:53:52,026
Mama, wait a minute.

455
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:54,863
Wait a minute.
1, 2... Like this.

456
00:53:54,964 --> 00:53:55,862
Do it one more time!

457
00:53:55,965 --> 00:53:57,023
You're almost there!

458
00:53:57,133 --> 00:54:01,001
That's it! Keep going!

459
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:02,765
See?

460
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:04,601
One more time.

461
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:10,509
Fucking faggot!

462
00:54:10,613 --> 00:54:12,547
What the fuck?

463
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:16,176
Fuck off!

464
00:54:16,285 --> 00:54:17,718
Assholes!

465
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:19,185
Let's go.

466
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,658
Tell Alan to paint this.

467
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,328
It's too dirty.

468
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:41,143
COCKSUCKER

469
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:00,128
Hey, Miss Nayda, let me do that!

470
00:55:00,229 --> 00:55:02,288
No, I'll do it myself.

471
00:55:02,398 --> 00:55:04,593
-I just wanna help.
-Thanks, I can manage.

472
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:07,795
-Sure, you're okay?
-I am.

473
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,355
If I were you, I'd settle for

474
00:56:38,502 --> 00:56:40,955
a live-in arrangement with Merly.

475
00:56:41,063 --> 00:56:43,964
Marriage is just a piece of paper.

476
00:56:44,066 --> 00:56:47,832
It doesn't guarantee
that you'll stay together forever.

477
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:50,405
Look at Auntie Flor.

478
00:56:50,506 --> 00:56:55,409
Her marriage broke up anyway.

479
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:49,626
See you next week.

480
00:57:54,203 --> 00:57:56,137
It's only 110 pesos.

481
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,003
110 pesos, my ass.

482
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:00,335
It's withered.

483
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:01,501
This one?

484
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:04,341
80 pesos.

485
00:58:05,047 --> 00:58:06,241
It's already withered.

486
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,317
No, it's not.

487
00:58:08,484 --> 00:58:11,009
Are you giving it to someone?

488
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,351
I'm gonna give it to him, stupid.

489
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:24,128
Jonas.

490
00:58:24,233 --> 00:58:26,601
I've taken my bath, Mom.

491
00:58:28,437 --> 00:58:29,734
Where did that flower come from?

492
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:33,536
Uncle Ronald said you bought it.

493
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:38,371
Sure, I forgot all about it.

494
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:45,913
Mama, you smell sour already.

495
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:42,296
How much for everything?

496
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:47,940
This one and this one.

497
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:49,909
How many did you order?
3, right?

498
01:00:50,012 --> 01:00:51,843
1, 2, 3.

499
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:54,674
80 pesos.

500
01:01:07,696 --> 01:01:09,789
Your change.

501
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:23,073
Just a second.

502
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,443
Look after the stove.
Tonette, mind the canteen.

503
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:28,108
I gave the kid too much change.

504
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:32,244
Hey, kid! Just a moment!

505
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:35,662
The change I gave you,

506
01:01:36,955 --> 01:01:40,052
I gave you 50. It should be 20.

507
01:01:40,162 --> 01:01:41,220
No, sir, 20.

508
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:45,323
No, I gave you 50 by mistake.

509
01:01:45,434 --> 01:01:47,425
No, sir, 20.

510
01:01:47,536 --> 01:01:50,027
Let me take a look.

511
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:52,038
Is this the one I gave you?

512
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:53,904
The other pocket.

513
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:56,534
Something must be wrong
with your eyes.

514
01:01:56,645 --> 01:01:58,237
20?

515
01:01:58,347 --> 01:02:00,008
Are you sure it was 20?

516
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:01,879
It could be here.

517
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:03,918
Nothing.

518
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:09,853
20... That was a 20.

519
01:02:17,566 --> 01:02:18,897
What happened?

520
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:22,095
No... 50, but he was holding a 20.

521
01:02:22,204 --> 01:02:24,672
How much exactly
did you hand him?

522
01:02:25,173 --> 01:02:27,139
I don't know.

523
01:02:28,577 --> 01:02:30,807
Let me check the cash box.

524
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:35,509
How much cash is there?
How much have we sold?

525
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:44,718
Give me one.

526
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,711
I won't stay long, Papa.

527
01:03:06,815 --> 01:03:10,376
We'll wait for you at the restaurant.

528
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:32,772
Boy! Boy!

529
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:35,105
Looks like she's due soon.

530
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:36,701
Dressed to kill!

531
01:03:36,812 --> 01:03:39,372
When are you going to be a mom --
I mean, a dad?

532
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:41,540
November.
Will you be the Godfather?

533
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:45,177
Too many sponsors already!

534
01:03:45,287 --> 01:03:48,415
-Brother, where's Mama?
-Upstairs.

535
01:03:49,825 --> 01:03:51,156
How's Mama?

536
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,854
Not good.

537
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:57,296
I'm with Papa and Carol.
They're at the restaurant.

538
01:03:57,399 --> 01:03:59,367
-Where's Jonas?
-Upstairs.

539
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:02,995
Visit us on Christmas.
Stay with us.

540
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:05,733
-We'll see.
-Even if it's just for a little while!

541
01:04:05,841 --> 01:04:08,401
We're very busy here.

542
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:11,639
Jewel, why the long face?

543
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:13,271
Heard you're going to college
next year.

544
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:15,373
Yes, Brother.

545
01:04:15,851 --> 01:04:17,682
Okay.

546
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:20,318
BEDMATES

547
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:33,091
Sir, it's good to see you.

548
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:38,473
How much?

549
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:39,802
It's up to you.

550
01:04:39,908 --> 01:04:40,772
Where do we go?

551
01:04:40,876 --> 01:04:43,436
Let's just stay here.

552
01:05:19,214 --> 01:05:20,738
Mama.

553
01:05:20,849 --> 01:05:22,373
It's you.

554
01:05:27,356 --> 01:05:29,290
I'm sorry.

555
01:05:31,593 --> 01:05:34,153
I still need to take a bath.

556
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,731
I'll wait, then.

557
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,162
What do you want from me?

558
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,898
I need to explain.

559
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:49,001
Go on. Make it fast.

560
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:54,481
Mama, it wasn't my sole decision
to testify in favor of Papa.

561
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:59,919
I consulted with Nayda
and Danny before he died.

562
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:05,792
Just as I thought.
You all conspired against me.

563
01:06:06,428 --> 01:06:10,159
Mama, please listen to me.

564
01:06:10,265 --> 01:06:15,134
If the court proved that Papa
was keeping another family,

565
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:19,264
the law would recognize
his children with Carol.

566
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:25,078
If the court proved
that your father has another family,

567
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:27,774
then I could file a legal separation.

568
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:29,350
That's what I wanted.

569
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:31,816
If the court failed to prove that,

570
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,720
the law would not recognize
his other children.

571
01:06:35,824 --> 01:06:39,282
Nayda, Jewel, and I,
we are his legal heirs.

572
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:41,727
His children with Carol
do not inherit anything.

573
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:43,855
You are after the money.

574
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:46,764
I'm not after the money, Jerome.

575
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:51,306
I want to prove
that your father cheated on me!

576
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:53,898
Because that's the truth!

577
01:06:54,676 --> 01:06:56,234
I'm going to appeal the case.

578
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:58,313
Mama, aren't you tired?

579
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,244
You've spent a fortune
on the lawyer's fees.

580
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,750
I'll hire another lawyer.

581
01:07:03,852 --> 01:07:05,615
Papa has been acquitted.

582
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:10,215
He was acquitted because
he and the judge lack morals.

583
01:08:09,017 --> 01:08:12,919
NO LOITERING HERE!!!

584
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:16,067
No! Don't!

585
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:20,133
Please don't!
Have mercy on me!

586
01:11:20,275 --> 01:11:21,970
You're mine!

587
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:23,203
You're mine!

588
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:25,404
No! Please don't!

589
01:11:38,226 --> 01:11:40,387
Hey, she's mine!

590
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,582
I love you so much.

591
01:12:07,756 --> 01:12:10,054
I love you, too.

592
01:12:12,794 --> 01:12:16,355
Miguel, why did you do this to me?

593
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:26,304
That was fast.

594
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:29,309
Why are you looking at me
like that?

595
01:12:33,381 --> 01:12:35,372
You bastard!

596
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:11,424
There's a goat!

597
01:16:40,161 --> 01:16:43,258
Mr. Lando, there's a goat
inside the movie house!

598
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:44,361
There's a goat!

599
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:47,392
Come on, hurry up!
Let's catch it!

600
01:16:50,605 --> 01:16:53,005
Over here, Mr. Lando!

601
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:56,209
There it is! Hurry up!

602
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:09,988
Chase it! Over there!

603
01:17:16,664 --> 01:17:19,326
Right here, right here!

604
01:17:40,021 --> 01:17:41,454
What happened?

605
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:43,683
There was a goat--

606
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:46,692
Go back inside.

607
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:48,820
Go, go, go!

608
01:18:39,581 --> 01:18:41,845
-Have you had dinner?
-Not yet.

609
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:44,510
Go, have your dinner.

610
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:56,290
Mama, a goat
got inside the movie house.

611
01:18:56,397 --> 01:18:58,422
A goat? What goat?

612
01:18:58,533 --> 01:19:01,001
There's a hole in the wall.

613
01:19:01,102 --> 01:19:03,570
What happened to the goat?

614
01:19:03,671 --> 01:19:07,402
It's gone. Lando and the boys
chased it out.

615
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:13,448
There's a lot to fix
in this movie house.

616
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:15,093
Gotcha!

617
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:23,203
You can't catch me!

618
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:30,881
Brother, give me that!

619
01:21:31,352 --> 01:21:35,049
That's mine! Give it to me!

620
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:36,520
Ouch! I can't see!

621
01:21:36,624 --> 01:21:38,319
Sister Nayda,
Jonas is wearing lipstick.

622
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:40,053
Give that to me!

623
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:41,492
Wanna play?

624
01:21:41,596 --> 01:21:44,793
Okay, here it is.

625
01:23:21,863 --> 01:23:23,854
What is your name?

626
01:23:23,965 --> 01:23:25,057
Ryan.

627
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:26,326
How old are you, Ryan?

628
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:27,992
17.

629
01:23:28,803 --> 01:23:31,135
Can I have a cigarette?

630
01:23:41,249 --> 01:23:43,240
Do you have any siblings?

631
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:44,750
-I have one.
-What's his name?

632
01:23:44,852 --> 01:23:45,978
Jason.

633
01:23:46,087 --> 01:23:47,452
What does Jason do?

634
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:49,853
He works in the market.

635
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:52,359
How much does he earn?

636
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:56,419
Depends on the sales.

637
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:59,295
Sometimes 70 or 80.

638
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,425
Only 70 pesos a day?

639
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:03,731
Who's better looking
between you two?

640
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:05,305
He is.

641
01:24:05,406 --> 01:24:06,600
Who's got a bigger dick?

642
01:24:06,707 --> 01:24:08,231
He does.

643
01:24:08,342 --> 01:24:09,969
Then why isn't he in the sex trade?

644
01:24:10,077 --> 01:24:11,305
He's not into it.

645
01:24:11,412 --> 01:24:16,714
And you?
Do you have a small dick?
