1
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:41,436
Alyssa.

2
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:46,608
This is ridiculous.

3
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:48,962
I want you
to go give your dad a hug.

4
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:50,297
Why?

5
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,007
Because he'll be gone
for his birthday.

6
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,093
Can we have a party
for him while he's gone?

7
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:59,014
I hope you're showered
and ready for school.

8
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:15,071
Sam broke his closet.

9
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,708
Beat it!
Get outta there! No, wait.

10
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,586
Stay there. Good boy.
Right there.

11
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,671
Come to daddy.

12
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,643
Come here, Guster!

13
00:04:50,982 --> 00:04:52,234
Have a nice day.

14
00:04:53,818 --> 00:04:55,987
- Stay.
- This has got to stop.

15
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:58,740
He escaped.
Now he's back in.

16
00:04:58,823 --> 00:05:03,119
Does it give you some sort
of perverse pleasure...

17
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:08,166
to expose your penis in front
of my 16-year-old daughter?

18
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,965
My exposure does not
face your windows.

19
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,591
George, this is the third time.

20
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:18,510
The plumber's due out tomorrow.

21
00:05:18,593 --> 00:05:21,680
You will just have
to explain that to the police.

22
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,308
You were the one neighbour
I could tolerate.

23
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,522
Coleen!

24
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:34,317
Just how far out
that window did you have...

25
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,778
to stick your head
to be able to see my dick?

26
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:41,324
I like your PJs!

27
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:51,459
I wish you'd talk to him.

28
00:05:51,543 --> 00:05:53,003
He needs a man.

29
00:05:54,462 --> 00:05:56,047
His father's a man.

30
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:59,593
- A man he respects.
- He respects nothing.

31
00:05:59,676 --> 00:06:03,096
Thanks for talking
about me behind my back.

32
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:05,432
It's useful in court.

33
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:07,434
Are you wearing eye make-up?

34
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:11,646
Take it off.

35
00:06:14,065 --> 00:06:17,152
If I just walk out
the door right now...

36
00:06:17,235 --> 00:06:19,029
who's gonna be here tonight
for the follow-through?

37
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:24,868
Have a nice flight.

38
00:06:28,914 --> 00:06:30,290
Queer.

39
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,792
What did you say?

40
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:34,586
Dad said it first.

41
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:42,093
I get chocolate cake
for your birthday.

42
00:06:42,177 --> 00:06:43,303
Are your hands clean?

43
00:06:54,606 --> 00:06:56,191
He's a fuckin' freak.

44
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,659
Dude, nice look.

45
00:07:05,742 --> 00:07:07,744
I saw your dad this morning.

46
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,166
Josh, what do you say?
Is he in?

47
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,876
Been thinking
about the job, man?

48
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,047
Forget him.

49
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,258
Two hours a week
for three hundred cash.

50
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:24,135
The whole summer.
Do the math.

51
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:26,054
He's not gonna do it, Josh.

52
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:28,515
Guess he doesn't have it in him.

53
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:31,935
They consider this a hatchback
or a station wagon?

54
00:07:33,144 --> 00:07:34,854
Les get outta here, dude.

55
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:38,608
Think about it.
I'll be around.

56
00:07:41,236 --> 00:07:44,197
Dude, I was in total REM.

57
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:48,743
Benson Kitter Architecture.
Can I help you?

58
00:07:48,827 --> 00:07:50,036
Yes, sir.

59
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:58,670
Done? Close to done?

60
00:07:58,753 --> 00:08:01,464
- I'm doing the grass.
- Fuck the grass.

61
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:04,342
Burke bid out the Berlin Plaza.
Did he tell you?

62
00:08:04,426 --> 00:08:07,137
I was gonna start that
on Monday.

63
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,140
He likes the look of the
computer models better anyway.

64
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,017
You take too long.

65
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,435
When you're done
mowing the grass here...

66
00:08:13,518 --> 00:08:15,145
do you mind bringing
the house up to my office?

67
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,147
Got a presentation to make.

68
00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:41,004
I wouldn't make a habit of it.

69
00:09:08,073 --> 00:09:09,366
I could be anyone.

70
00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:14,371
Then why do you stay you?

71
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:16,122
You should lock your door.

72
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:19,668
Ring the bell before
you try the door.

73
00:09:22,254 --> 00:09:25,548
Did Sam call to tell you
he won't be over this weekend?

74
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:30,053
Why did you let him
pierce his chin?

75
00:09:32,764 --> 00:09:35,433
What kind of a mother
can't stand her own son?

76
00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:42,649
I don't know.

77
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:06,006
Why aren't you coming
for the weekend?

78
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:14,055
What is he doing? George?

79
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:18,351
- George, what are you doing?
- He doesn't answer.

80
00:10:18,435 --> 00:10:19,603
He never answers.

81
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,146
Why does he have
a lock on his door?

82
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:22,939
Because he put a lock on it.

83
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:26,443
Do you really think I told him
he could put a hole in his face?

84
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:30,071
Just climb up there and tell him
what he can and can't do.

85
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:34,284
Take him for the summer, OK?
Whip him into shape.

86
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:38,747
Make him smile!
Let him hate you for a while.

87
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,341
You need all the brain cells
you've got.

88
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:57,849
Go away!

89
00:11:05,273 --> 00:11:07,776
I don't know what to do anymore.

90
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:10,570
You take him.
Just take him.

91
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:13,490
You're such a good father.

92
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:23,792
What are you doing in my room?

93
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,710
I didn't go in your room.

94
00:11:25,794 --> 00:11:29,381
I locked the door! Get out!

95
00:11:29,464 --> 00:11:33,426
What do you think, I'm stupid?
I locked the door!

96
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,929
This is my room!

97
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:39,933
You have no right in here!
This is mine!

98
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:42,060
This is stupid.

99
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:45,647
Why can't you all just die
and leave me alone?

100
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,129
Benson, Kitter, Fein,
Silver and Associates.

101
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:11,756
Can I help you please?
George, good morning.

102
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,134
Mr Burke would like
to see you in his office.

103
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:42,245
Come on in. Have a seat.

104
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,124
- Orange juice? Croissant?
- No, I'm good.

105
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,127
What are you on, George?

106
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,421
Beg your pardon?

107
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,007
How much weight have you lost?

108
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,383
I don't know.

109
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:57,510
Five, ten pounds.
Haven't been very hungry.

110
00:12:57,594 --> 00:12:59,930
How's your wife?

111
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:05,185
When we divorced a decade ago,
she was very angry.

112
00:13:05,268 --> 00:13:06,728
Now she's just hostile.

113
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:09,105
Right.

114
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:10,607
I did tell you, didn't I,
that I would be ready...

115
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,234
to start the Berlin model today?

116
00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:18,740
George, this is not me.

117
00:13:18,823 --> 00:13:22,535
We can show clients
endless options.

118
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:24,162
We can change anything,
really...

119
00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:26,456
in a matter of hours
on the computer...

120
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,376
but you won't change.

121
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:36,716
I've been here twenty years.

122
00:13:37,842 --> 00:13:40,220
Maybe that's too long.

123
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,848
Maybe?

124
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,142
It's too long.

125
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,145
Listen.

126
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,982
They decided
on a week a year severance...

127
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:55,151
but I got 'em to twenty-six, OK?

128
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:58,446
You can learn all you need to on
the computer long before that.

129
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,033
Maybe even find a job
closer to home.

130
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:05,328
I hate this job.

131
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:06,913
George,
what are you talking about?

132
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:08,456
You love your job.

133
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,251
Nope.
From the day I started to today.

134
00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:14,212
Can't stand it.

135
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:15,839
Well, good.

136
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,258
Then it sounds like
I'm doing you a favour.

137
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:22,387
You know what?
I feel better about this.

138
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:25,890
Good. I was hoping you would.

139
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:42,449
- Can I ask you one favour?
- What can I do for you?

140
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:47,162
I built my first model here
when I was twenty-five.

141
00:14:47,245 --> 00:14:49,915
There must be hundreds of 'em
around the office.

142
00:14:49,998 --> 00:14:53,960
I was wondering if I might
pick a few to take home.

143
00:14:54,044 --> 00:14:57,672
Just the ones that
really mean something to me.

144
00:14:57,756 --> 00:15:01,134
Well, those...

145
00:15:01,217 --> 00:15:04,888
I mean, George,
we can't really keep our work.

146
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:08,141
I could maybe ask them
if you could choose one...

147
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:10,894
but they're a part of the firm.

148
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:14,272
Look, why don't you go
out there and look them over.

149
00:15:14,356 --> 00:15:16,775
Every single one of them, OK?

150
00:15:16,858 --> 00:15:20,195
Pick the one you like the best.
Take it with you.

151
00:15:21,238 --> 00:15:23,156
Now, run it by me first.

152
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,493
Just in case, you know.
I'm sure it'll be OK.

153
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,510
George, Mr Burke
would like to see you.

154
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,679
- Fine.
- In his office when you're able.

155
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:10,972
Sure.

156
00:17:13,975 --> 00:17:15,936
I'll keep this one
if that's all right with you.

157
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:18,438
You're a great architect
and a miserable human being.

158
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:19,689
that's mine.

159
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:22,150
No, George, don't! Shit!

160
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,612
You're not even
a fucking architect...

161
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:27,322
and you're
a miserable human being.

162
00:17:27,405 --> 00:17:30,242
You're right. You win.

163
00:17:50,262 --> 00:17:52,180
Sir?

164
00:17:52,264 --> 00:17:53,306
Sir, are you all right?
Can you hear me?

165
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,934
Is he breathing?

166
00:17:56,017 --> 00:17:57,811
Come on.

167
00:17:57,894 --> 00:17:59,354
Someone call 911.

168
00:19:17,098 --> 00:19:19,142
That took care of the pain?

169
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:22,312
I could kiss you.

170
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:30,695
No food.

171
00:19:32,072 --> 00:19:33,615
I'm painless.

172
00:19:38,536 --> 00:19:42,040
What would you do if you had
three or four months to live?

173
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,003
I'd eat a lot of red meat.

174
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:48,421
Good for you.

175
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:51,091
What would you do?

176
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,470
Build a house.

177
00:19:55,553 --> 00:19:56,930
Yeah? What kind of house?

178
00:19:59,516 --> 00:20:02,060
You know what
mortise and tenon is?

179
00:20:04,854 --> 00:20:08,775
I've got every part of it ready.
It's like a jigsaw puzzle.

180
00:20:08,858 --> 00:20:12,904
Only pieces now waiting
to make sense.

181
00:20:12,988 --> 00:20:14,114
Been through design review...

182
00:20:14,197 --> 00:20:17,158
the planning commission,
city council.

183
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:23,832
No one's really said...

184
00:20:23,915 --> 00:20:26,042
that four months
is all you have, have they?

185
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,256
Nobody's even pretended
to offer treatment.

186
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:36,803
So you tell me,
when would you start...

187
00:20:36,886 --> 00:20:38,179
eating red meat?

188
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:43,435
Can you build a house
in four months?

189
00:20:43,518 --> 00:20:45,270
I can die trying.

190
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:49,566
Good for you.

191
00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:54,112
I've not been touched in years.

192
00:20:54,195 --> 00:20:59,367
Really?
No, I mean, not a friend?

193
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:02,454
Your mother?
People have to be touched.

194
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:04,706
Everyone gets touched
by somebody they love.

195
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,209
I know.

196
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:09,669
It's weird, isn't it?

197
00:21:11,296 --> 00:21:14,758
I know my son,
when he was younger...

198
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:19,596
ten or eleven even,
he used to run up...

199
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,640
and throw his arms around me.

200
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:21,241
I'm sorry.

201
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:30,584
I'm scared.

202
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:03,199
Where have you been?
I called everyone everywhere.

203
00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:04,659
You just vanished.

204
00:23:04,743 --> 00:23:07,537
- You could be dead.
- Not today.

205
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:10,332
You are inconsiderate and
absolutely devoid of emotion.

206
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:15,086
You're the most beautiful woman
I have ever known.

207
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,797
- What?
- I don't mean just physically.

208
00:23:17,881 --> 00:23:19,758
Even your anger is perfect.

209
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:22,135
And where have you been
for a week?

210
00:23:22,218 --> 00:23:23,845
Four days.

211
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:26,806
I have to talk to you.

212
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,099
Why would they tow your truck?

213
00:23:30,644 --> 00:23:32,938
I'm gonna tear down the shack
and build the house.

214
00:23:35,106 --> 00:23:36,858
You've been saying that
for twenty years.

215
00:23:36,942 --> 00:23:39,945
While we were dating
you said it.

216
00:23:40,028 --> 00:23:42,322
- Now there's nothing to stop me.
- Oh, money?

217
00:23:43,281 --> 00:23:44,699
Severance pay.

218
00:23:44,783 --> 00:23:46,952
And I'm gonna cash in
my life insurance policy.

219
00:23:47,035 --> 00:23:49,246
Where will you live?

220
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:50,997
In the garage.

221
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:54,167
Look, I wasn't serious
about you taking Sam...

222
00:23:54,251 --> 00:23:56,544
so you don't have to get
into any actual construction...

223
00:23:56,628 --> 00:23:58,630
to get out of it.

224
00:23:58,713 --> 00:24:00,674
When does school let out?

225
00:24:00,757 --> 00:24:02,425
Friday. Tomorrow.

226
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:03,843
Oh, God.

227
00:24:03,927 --> 00:24:07,180
I hate the thought
of him home all day.

228
00:24:07,264 --> 00:24:08,765
I'll be by Saturday
to pick him up.

229
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:11,851
He doesn't want to spend
the weekends with you anymore.

230
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:15,605
Not for the weekend.
For the summer.

231
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:18,316
One of you would end up dead.

232
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,318
But at least we'd have
a house to show for it.

233
00:24:20,402 --> 00:24:23,071
Forget it, really.
I'll survive.

234
00:24:24,781 --> 00:24:26,199
I want him with me.

235
00:24:26,283 --> 00:24:27,993
No, you don't. Trust me.

236
00:24:28,076 --> 00:24:30,620
I want Sam for the summer.

237
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:39,879
Jesus.

238
00:24:39,963 --> 00:24:41,298
Well, I'm married.

239
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:50,223
The whole summer, Sam.
Party in Tahoe.

240
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:52,559
I don't know, Corey.
Let me think about it, OK?

241
00:24:52,642 --> 00:24:54,311
All we gotta do is sand
and paint the cabin.

242
00:24:54,394 --> 00:24:56,187
My daïs gonna let me
use his boat.

243
00:24:56,271 --> 00:24:58,023
My charm's gonna
let me use my rod.

244
00:24:58,106 --> 00:24:59,858
And you know that
Incan Village is the place...

245
00:24:59,941 --> 00:25:01,401
to hook up with some hump.

246
00:25:01,484 --> 00:25:02,611
OK, I'll ask.

247
00:25:02,694 --> 00:25:04,029
All right,
I'm just saying it beats...

248
00:25:04,112 --> 00:25:06,239
letting townfolk
go down on you for the summer.

249
00:25:07,449 --> 00:25:09,534
I haven't done anything.

250
00:25:09,618 --> 00:25:12,454
I know what the deal is.
Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.

251
00:25:12,537 --> 00:25:14,164
Obviously you don't know
what the deal is...

252
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:16,207
because there is
no fucking deal.

253
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,836
Lighten up, dude.

254
00:25:45,028 --> 00:25:47,239
- Good morning, Mr George.
- Hiya.

255
00:25:47,322 --> 00:25:49,157
Mrs Kimble is in the backyard.

256
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:50,283
And...

257
00:25:51,368 --> 00:25:52,577
Packing.

258
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,498
Good.

259
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:14,182
Almost ready?

260
00:26:19,604 --> 00:26:21,565
Would you mind
turning this down?

261
00:26:25,944 --> 00:26:27,487
It won't be all work, you know.

262
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:33,910
It won't be all work!

263
00:26:36,955 --> 00:26:38,623
I heard you already.

264
00:26:38,707 --> 00:26:41,918
Your mom and the boys
can come by anytime.

265
00:26:42,002 --> 00:26:44,546
What, to check up on me?

266
00:26:44,629 --> 00:26:46,214
I'll be there
to check up on you.

267
00:26:46,298 --> 00:26:47,674
Why would you be there?

268
00:26:47,757 --> 00:26:49,718
Well, I live there.

269
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:53,221
You live in Corey's
parents' cabin in Tahoe?

270
00:26:53,305 --> 00:26:55,223
What are you talking about?

271
00:26:55,307 --> 00:26:57,559
- Who's Corey?
- Corey's my friend.

272
00:26:57,642 --> 00:26:58,810
I'm going to spend
the summer, OK?

273
00:26:58,894 --> 00:27:00,228
No, you're not going anywhere.

274
00:27:00,312 --> 00:27:01,855
You're spending the summer
with me.

275
00:27:01,938 --> 00:27:04,274
Shit! No fucking way!

276
00:27:04,357 --> 00:27:07,277
Robin, did you tell Sam he was
spending the summer with me?

277
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,612
What was I supposed to do?

278
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:10,030
I tried to call.
Your phone isn't working.

279
00:27:10,113 --> 00:27:11,323
I don't have a phone anymore.

280
00:27:11,406 --> 00:27:14,159
Who are you, anyway?
I don't even know you.

281
00:27:14,242 --> 00:27:15,619
You'll know me
by the time we're through.

282
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:16,912
I'm not going.

283
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:19,080
I'll get your bag.

284
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:23,418
Would you tell him
that I'm not going?

285
00:27:23,501 --> 00:27:25,629
You already promised me!

286
00:27:25,712 --> 00:27:27,797
- George, I did say he could go.
- Is this everything?

287
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:30,175
Mom, please. Tell him!

288
00:27:30,258 --> 00:27:32,552
George, I...

289
00:27:32,636 --> 00:27:35,347
He is not spending
the entire summer...

290
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,724
with some kid in Tahoe!

291
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:41,019
He can hate me.
You can hate me.

292
00:27:41,102 --> 00:27:42,646
He can try to kill me
while I'm sleeping!

293
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:44,022
I don't care!

294
00:27:44,105 --> 00:27:47,025
Sam is spending
the summer with me, OK?

295
00:27:47,108 --> 00:27:48,735
He's my son. He's sixteen.

296
00:27:48,818 --> 00:27:50,153
that's it!

297
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:51,905
Can I hate you, too?

298
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:55,158
You can do anything you want.

299
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:57,827
- Go get in the truck.
- You go fuck yourself!

300
00:28:02,123 --> 00:28:03,500
Listen to me.

301
00:28:05,085 --> 00:28:07,420
I want that thing
out of your chin, OK?

302
00:28:07,504 --> 00:28:09,172
You got nipple rings,
naval rings...

303
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:10,382
those come out, too.

304
00:28:10,465 --> 00:28:12,175
And there's no make-up
at my house.

305
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:13,843
No glue sniffing, huffing...

306
00:28:13,927 --> 00:28:16,388
no pills, no grass.

307
00:28:16,471 --> 00:28:18,848
You've worn out your welcome
at this house, Sam.

308
00:28:18,932 --> 00:28:21,226
This may be the worst summer
of your entire life...

309
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:22,727
but you've earned it.

310
00:28:22,811 --> 00:28:25,647
Now go pick up the suitcase,
get in the truck, now.

311
00:28:30,277 --> 00:28:32,696
I'll hate you
for the rest of my life.

312
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:35,240
Well, you can't even begin to
know how much I hate my father.

313
00:28:35,323 --> 00:28:36,950
Think of it
as a family tradition.

314
00:28:50,964 --> 00:28:52,215
You like garlic?

315
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:53,508
Do you like garlic bread?

316
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:19,409
Thinking of jumping?

317
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:20,994
Pushing.

318
00:29:22,871 --> 00:29:24,122
Well, don't jump
till you hear...

319
00:29:24,205 --> 00:29:27,500
the wave crash
against the cliff.

320
00:29:27,584 --> 00:29:29,920
Water'll take you out.
Let it.

321
00:29:31,254 --> 00:29:34,382
First time I did it,
younger than you...

322
00:29:34,466 --> 00:29:37,010
I thought I'd break my neck...

323
00:29:37,093 --> 00:29:40,597
and just sort of
float out to Catalina.

324
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,099
You don't always get
what you wish for, Sam.

325
00:29:54,402 --> 00:29:57,364
Shit. Shit.

326
00:29:58,281 --> 00:30:00,533
Hello!

327
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,833
Oh, my God.

328
00:30:16,424 --> 00:30:17,717
I don't believe this!

329
00:30:19,386 --> 00:30:21,263
Are you totally insane?

330
00:30:23,557 --> 00:30:24,724
God!

331
00:30:26,309 --> 00:30:27,477
I don't believe this.

332
00:30:27,561 --> 00:30:29,563
I got a total wacko
for a father.

333
00:30:31,106 --> 00:30:32,691
I almost saw Catalina!

334
00:30:37,445 --> 00:30:39,573
What have you gotten
all over yourself?

335
00:30:39,656 --> 00:30:41,366
What is this?
Is this pasta sauce?

336
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:43,743
You crazy dog, Guster.

337
00:30:43,827 --> 00:30:45,161
Come here. Lick it.

338
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:46,955
You're crazy, you know this?

339
00:30:54,087 --> 00:30:56,631
What are you doing here?

340
00:30:56,715 --> 00:30:59,634
They're trying to make me
spend the summer here...

341
00:30:59,718 --> 00:31:01,303
but I'm leaving in the morning.

342
00:31:01,386 --> 00:31:03,096
Where to?

343
00:31:04,306 --> 00:31:06,099
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.

344
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:09,853
I guess if you stay,
I'll see you around.

345
00:31:12,397 --> 00:31:13,815
You should stay.

346
00:31:15,191 --> 00:31:16,443
Where's your dad?

347
00:31:22,282 --> 00:31:23,825
He jumped into the ocean.

348
00:31:27,203 --> 00:31:28,747
Well, tell him I say hello.

349
00:31:57,984 --> 00:32:02,030
I'm not taking a dump
with you in here.

350
00:32:02,113 --> 00:32:06,910
My brothers say It's the worst
smell they've ever smelt.

351
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:16,086
Which side of the bed
do you want?

352
00:32:16,169 --> 00:32:18,505
- I'm not...
- Just kidding.

353
00:32:18,588 --> 00:32:21,716
The sofa's a pull-out.

354
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,176
Jesus.

355
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,596
You know, I think
you have to have a door...

356
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,850
between where you cook
and where you crap.

357
00:32:30,934 --> 00:32:33,228
Even in the bush,
tribal people don't like that.

358
00:32:33,311 --> 00:32:36,022
They have a place for both.

359
00:32:36,106 --> 00:32:38,191
Probably It's, like, a law.

360
00:32:40,944 --> 00:32:42,445
God!

361
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:45,198
Probably in the Bible.

362
00:32:45,282 --> 00:32:47,951
It's at least
a building code violation.

363
00:32:52,122 --> 00:32:53,290
Good night.

364
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:56,710
I have to take a dump.

365
00:33:43,465 --> 00:33:45,216
You wearing sunscreen?

366
00:33:48,094 --> 00:33:50,847
Are you wearing sunscreen?

367
00:33:55,352 --> 00:33:56,728
I wonder where he's living?

368
00:33:56,811 --> 00:33:58,188
About time.

369
00:33:58,271 --> 00:34:02,692
They're finally tearing down
this pile of junk.

370
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:07,864
Barbara, Tom.

371
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,202
Guess how many
low-income apartments...

372
00:34:12,285 --> 00:34:14,621
the city approved for this lot.

373
00:34:14,704 --> 00:34:16,122
Ballpark figure.

374
00:34:16,206 --> 00:34:17,666
No. Not today.

375
00:34:17,749 --> 00:34:20,126
There was also some talk
about a drug-rehab centre.

376
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,336
Jerk.

377
00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:24,506
We can't do anything.

378
00:34:33,598 --> 00:34:35,267
What are you doing?
Don't touch me.

379
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,893
I warned you yesterday.

380
00:34:36,977 --> 00:34:38,937
You can't touch me.

381
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,898
You stayed.

382
00:34:44,276 --> 00:34:46,611
Rub him down, will you, Alyssa?

383
00:34:53,994 --> 00:34:55,245
He's insane.

384
00:34:55,328 --> 00:34:59,165
You look better without make-up.

385
00:34:59,249 --> 00:35:01,209
I can't even take a shower here.

386
00:35:01,293 --> 00:35:03,169
Come over to my house
whenever you want.

387
00:35:03,253 --> 00:35:05,130
I'll tell my mom.

388
00:35:05,213 --> 00:35:08,883
I might not even stay anyway.

389
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:10,510
I'll get your back.

390
00:35:10,594 --> 00:35:11,803
No, that's OK. Thanks.

391
00:35:11,887 --> 00:35:14,222
Ever had anyone
besides your mom or dad...

392
00:35:14,306 --> 00:35:16,391
put it on for you?

393
00:35:16,474 --> 00:35:18,476
It's weird how different it is.

394
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,229
Turn around. Just lay down.

395
00:35:21,313 --> 00:35:23,690
Do you remember me?

396
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:26,693
From when you lived here before?

397
00:35:28,445 --> 00:35:31,197
So I've decided that
I'm not going to shave...

398
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:33,825
my legs or my pits this summer.

399
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:35,243
I mean, Paula Cole
isn't a vertical kisser.

400
00:35:35,327 --> 00:35:38,371
Really?

401
00:35:38,455 --> 00:35:41,708
So, your daïs really
going to build his house?

402
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:43,084
I don't know.

403
00:35:43,168 --> 00:35:47,213
Your dad dated my mom
after her divorce.

404
00:35:47,297 --> 00:35:48,423
Really?

405
00:35:48,506 --> 00:35:51,384
Yeah. I wanted him to marry her.

406
00:35:51,468 --> 00:35:52,761
Why?

407
00:35:54,804 --> 00:35:56,014
Turn over.

408
00:36:02,145 --> 00:36:03,688
Josh and I are actually
going to South Coast.

409
00:36:03,772 --> 00:36:06,274
Do you want a ride?
Maybe see a movie?

410
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:09,319
No, thanks.

411
00:36:09,402 --> 00:36:11,404
All right, well,
don't forget your front.

412
00:36:11,488 --> 00:36:13,281
I'll see you around.

413
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:25,418
Pretty, isn't she?

414
00:36:26,878 --> 00:36:28,463
For a girl.

415
00:36:38,306 --> 00:36:40,183
Feel free to pitch in anytime.

416
00:37:37,032 --> 00:37:39,075
Sam, do you ever...

417
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:42,203
get the slightest inkling
you might want to help me...

418
00:37:42,287 --> 00:37:45,749
instead of doing
absolutely nothing?

419
00:37:45,832 --> 00:37:47,876
Here.

420
00:37:51,087 --> 00:37:53,798
I hate turkey.

421
00:37:53,882 --> 00:37:55,175
No, you don't.

422
00:37:55,258 --> 00:37:58,470
If I say I do, I do.

423
00:37:58,553 --> 00:38:04,643
Please, take that thumbtack
out of your face.

424
00:38:04,726 --> 00:38:05,894
- Let me just get it out.
- Why?

425
00:38:05,977 --> 00:38:08,146
Come on. It bugs me.

426
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:11,691
You snore at night.
That really bugs me.

427
00:38:11,775 --> 00:38:13,818
Can I take you out?

428
00:38:19,532 --> 00:38:22,827
You know, your brothers
are right about that smell.

429
00:38:22,911 --> 00:38:24,454
That was the most
god-awful thing...

430
00:38:24,537 --> 00:38:26,081
I've ever had my nose around.

431
00:38:26,164 --> 00:38:28,208
- Told you.
- It's toxic.

432
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:31,044
Thought you guys
might be hungry.

433
00:38:31,127 --> 00:38:33,546
We're fine.
Turkey sandwiches.

434
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,840
Oh, well. For later, then.

435
00:38:44,724 --> 00:38:47,394
- Makes me sad.
- Why?

436
00:38:49,145 --> 00:38:50,605
I used to live here.

437
00:38:50,689 --> 00:38:53,149
And you hated four out of
the five years that you did.

438
00:38:53,233 --> 00:38:56,987
I was here six years,
and I only hated two.

439
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,656
Which two?

440
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:02,075
The first and the last.

441
00:39:03,868 --> 00:39:06,246
I don't even like
turkey sandwiches.

442
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:07,831
What's this pizza?

443
00:39:07,914 --> 00:39:10,125
Sam's favourite.

444
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:12,085
Sure you don't want any?

445
00:39:16,214 --> 00:39:17,674
George, you're too thin...

446
00:39:17,757 --> 00:39:20,802
from what you used to be anyway.

447
00:39:22,846 --> 00:39:25,056
Why the first and the last?

448
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,559
The first because I wasn't sure
you really loved me...

449
00:39:27,642 --> 00:39:31,187
and the last because I wasn't
sure I really loved you.

450
00:39:35,525 --> 00:39:37,611
I was up on that roof
this morning tearing it down...

451
00:39:37,694 --> 00:39:41,740
and it struck me,
strong as anything ever has...

452
00:39:43,116 --> 00:39:45,243
I'm happy today.

453
00:39:45,327 --> 00:39:47,787
What were you before today?

454
00:39:47,871 --> 00:39:51,458
I don't know what it was...

455
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:55,045
the way the sun struck the ocean
or the sound of the waves.

456
00:39:55,128 --> 00:39:56,713
It was simple, whatever it was.

457
00:40:00,008 --> 00:40:02,302
Then I started thinking...

458
00:40:02,385 --> 00:40:06,181
when the last time was
that I felt like this.

459
00:40:06,264 --> 00:40:08,225
Do you remember?

460
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:15,899
Yeah, the one time
I remember for sure.

461
00:40:15,982 --> 00:40:20,695
I was with Sam in the ocean...

462
00:40:20,779 --> 00:40:23,949
saving him from the waves.

463
00:40:24,032 --> 00:40:28,203
He had his head on my shoulder,
and we were laughing.

464
00:40:31,623 --> 00:40:34,834
I could feel his heart
pounding against my chest.

465
00:40:37,754 --> 00:40:42,050
I remember I kissed his hair.

466
00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:44,261
This was before it was blue.

467
00:40:49,015 --> 00:40:52,143
We have it on video.

468
00:40:52,227 --> 00:40:55,230
It was when my parents were
down for his sixth birthday.

469
00:40:55,313 --> 00:40:56,898
I remember that.

470
00:41:11,871 --> 00:41:13,957
I got to go.

471
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,208
What is it?

472
00:41:15,292 --> 00:41:19,045
Oh, nothing. I'm fine.

473
00:41:19,129 --> 00:41:21,590
I'll drop off your lunch
tomorrow.

474
00:41:28,138 --> 00:41:29,764
I'm going for a walk.

475
00:41:29,848 --> 00:41:31,391
I need some money.

476
00:41:31,474 --> 00:41:33,894
You'll have money when you work.

477
00:41:35,896 --> 00:41:37,230
You're predictable.

478
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,283
You haven't been happy
in ten years?

479
00:42:53,848 --> 00:42:56,643
I'm not doing it.

480
00:42:56,726 --> 00:42:58,395
It's going to be good.

481
00:42:58,478 --> 00:43:01,773
You know, nobody
would blame me if I left.

482
00:43:01,856 --> 00:43:05,860
I'd blame you.
I want you here.

483
00:43:05,944 --> 00:43:09,197
Why don't you just go beg
some money off my dad...

484
00:43:09,281 --> 00:43:12,033
so you can move
into someplace decent...

485
00:43:12,117 --> 00:43:14,744
with a real kitchen
and a real bathroom?

486
00:43:14,828 --> 00:43:20,250
I'd rather sell my nuts
to a castrati.

487
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:22,210
I don't beg.

488
00:43:22,294 --> 00:43:24,421
And I don't take a shower
in the middle of the yard!

489
00:43:24,504 --> 00:43:26,214
I can promise you
complete privacy.

490
00:43:26,298 --> 00:43:27,632
No, you can't!

491
00:43:27,716 --> 00:43:29,217
You can't promise me anything...

492
00:43:29,301 --> 00:43:31,219
because you don't
have anything to promise.

493
00:43:31,303 --> 00:43:36,099
You live in a garage, OK?
You don't have cable.

494
00:43:36,182 --> 00:43:37,309
You're not hooked up
for the internet...

495
00:43:37,392 --> 00:43:39,227
because you don't even
own a computer.

496
00:43:41,563 --> 00:43:43,940
And you don't have a job.

497
00:43:47,611 --> 00:43:49,571
Just try it.

498
00:43:49,654 --> 00:43:52,657
that's all I'm asking.
Just try it.

499
00:43:54,826 --> 00:43:58,204
Come on, Sam.
I'm begging, OK?

500
00:43:58,288 --> 00:44:00,957
Go fuck yourself.

501
00:44:13,929 --> 00:44:15,096
Is Alyssa home?

502
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,514
She went out with a friend.

503
00:44:23,563 --> 00:44:26,191
I didn't recognize you.

504
00:44:26,274 --> 00:44:30,237
Alyssa said you two don't even
have plumbing over there.

505
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,530
Not a shower.

506
00:44:32,614 --> 00:44:34,282
Come on.

507
00:44:42,332 --> 00:44:45,919
I hope your ex-husbanïs
equipped for the havoc of Sam...

508
00:44:46,002 --> 00:44:48,880
because it seems absolutely
blissful here tonight.

509
00:44:52,342 --> 00:44:53,885
There you go.

510
00:45:03,979 --> 00:45:08,233
Do you think It's odd
your kids don't hug you?

511
00:45:08,316 --> 00:45:09,484
Should I?

512
00:45:09,568 --> 00:45:12,279
It would worry me.

513
00:45:12,362 --> 00:45:15,031
If I let everything that
should worry me worry me...

514
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:18,201
I'd be dead from worry.

515
00:45:19,536 --> 00:45:21,871
What would you be
if you asked Ryan and Adam...

516
00:45:21,955 --> 00:45:24,291
to run in here right now
and hug you?

517
00:45:24,374 --> 00:45:26,918
I'd be you.

518
00:45:29,588 --> 00:45:32,883
I'll do it,
if that's what you want.

519
00:45:39,514 --> 00:45:40,724
Kurt, is that you?

520
00:45:40,807 --> 00:45:43,935
There has to be
a logical explanation.

521
00:45:44,019 --> 00:45:45,228
No hot water.

522
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,065
Your buddy Mr Dokos
called to complain...

523
00:45:49,149 --> 00:45:53,612
that you and a boy are squatting
illegally in your garage.

524
00:45:53,695 --> 00:45:56,156
Check the permits.

525
00:45:56,239 --> 00:45:58,825
It was built as a guest house.

526
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:00,952
It's a legally-rentable unit.

527
00:46:04,915 --> 00:46:06,374
Now, that's got to be illegal.

528
00:46:09,669 --> 00:46:11,504
Dokos?

529
00:46:11,588 --> 00:46:13,757
I'll piss on his lawn.

530
00:46:16,468 --> 00:46:18,470
Bro, I need you tonight.

531
00:46:21,014 --> 00:46:22,891
I locked the door.

532
00:46:24,392 --> 00:46:28,104
It'll take you
twenty, thirty minutes.

533
00:46:28,188 --> 00:46:29,689
Does Alyssa know?

534
00:46:29,773 --> 00:46:31,024
No. Nothing.

535
00:46:31,107 --> 00:46:32,567
She sent me up here
to see if you wanted...

536
00:46:32,651 --> 00:46:35,111
to hang out with her
and her mom and watch a movie.

537
00:46:35,195 --> 00:46:36,738
You got any more weed?

538
00:46:36,821 --> 00:46:39,282
You got any money?

539
00:46:39,366 --> 00:46:42,202
Three hundred cash, two hours.

540
00:46:55,298 --> 00:46:56,550
You don't have to do a thing.

541
00:46:56,633 --> 00:47:00,512
Just get in, get out,
as quick as you can.

542
00:47:00,595 --> 00:47:05,183
Close your eyes.
Think of whatever.

543
00:47:08,186 --> 00:47:10,522
So, What's the deal
between you and Alyssa?

544
00:47:10,605 --> 00:47:13,692
Don't even. I'm there.

545
00:47:13,775 --> 00:47:16,903
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

546
00:47:16,987 --> 00:47:20,407
Wouldn't even fucking go out
with me until she was sixteen.

547
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:25,120
That wasn't even a rule.
That was just her own thing.

548
00:47:25,203 --> 00:47:28,748
She figures things out
on her own, and that's it.

549
00:47:37,507 --> 00:47:40,218
If this rings, run.

550
00:47:42,012 --> 00:47:43,889
He already knows about
everything you can't do.

551
00:47:43,972 --> 00:47:48,518
And you can tell him
not to look at you if you want.

552
00:47:48,602 --> 00:47:51,146
This feels too weird now.

553
00:47:51,229 --> 00:47:54,232
I don't like it.

554
00:48:02,991 --> 00:48:04,618
Beats working.

555
00:48:54,668 --> 00:48:56,586
You want to roll down
the window, please?

556
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:57,796
Look at me.

557
00:48:57,879 --> 00:48:59,798
Whad you just toss
into the brush?

558
00:48:59,881 --> 00:49:01,091
Nothing.

559
00:49:03,176 --> 00:49:04,761
Hey, you! Kid!

560
00:49:04,844 --> 00:49:06,471
Stop right there!
Hold it, kid!

561
00:49:10,892 --> 00:49:12,811
Turn off your engine.

562
00:50:18,835 --> 00:50:21,004
Lunch.

563
00:50:21,087 --> 00:50:23,840
Lunch? It's not breakfast yet.

564
00:50:30,138 --> 00:50:33,141
I dreamed about your house
last night.

565
00:50:33,225 --> 00:50:34,809
Finished or unfinished?

566
00:50:34,893 --> 00:50:36,561
It was perfect, George.

567
00:50:36,645 --> 00:50:38,146
It was amazing.

568
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:39,481
It was so real.

569
00:50:41,107 --> 00:50:43,068
Didn't you once dream that
you could lick people well?

570
00:50:43,151 --> 00:50:45,195
That wasn't a dream.
That was Sam.

571
00:50:47,197 --> 00:50:48,907
Right.

572
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:50,283
His ear infection.

573
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:53,578
My tongue around the edge
of his ear is what cured him.

574
00:50:53,662 --> 00:50:57,040
Will you go in that garage
and lick his attitude?

575
00:50:57,123 --> 00:50:59,459
The antibiotics
weren't working...

576
00:50:59,542 --> 00:51:02,796
and that is what I believe,
George.

577
00:51:06,758 --> 00:51:09,219
You're wrong
about that first year.

578
00:51:16,977 --> 00:51:19,813
I've been wrong
a lot in my life.

579
00:51:23,567 --> 00:51:25,235
Hindsight.

580
00:51:27,028 --> 00:51:29,823
It's like foresight
without a future.

581
00:51:36,955 --> 00:51:39,082
I have three hours
before I go get the kids.

582
00:51:39,165 --> 00:51:41,459
Where will I be most useful?

583
00:51:41,543 --> 00:51:44,421
With your hands or your tongue?

584
00:51:44,504 --> 00:51:46,506
You're not well.

585
00:51:54,556 --> 00:51:56,975
- I just hit it?
- Hit it as hard as you can.

586
00:51:57,058 --> 00:51:58,810
that's it. Yes.

587
00:52:05,191 --> 00:52:07,193
I should go.

588
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,209
- Good morning.
- Sam, Ryan has a game later.

589
00:52:23,293 --> 00:52:24,961
He asked if you'd go watch.

590
00:52:32,135 --> 00:52:34,304
George Monroe?

591
00:52:34,387 --> 00:52:36,223
- Robin.
- Excuse me.

592
00:52:38,266 --> 00:52:39,517
Mr Monroe.

593
00:52:41,937 --> 00:52:44,147
I've been dreading you.

594
00:52:44,231 --> 00:52:46,858
Bob Larson, city inspector.

595
00:52:46,942 --> 00:52:49,152
Hi, Bob.

596
00:52:49,236 --> 00:52:50,820
Do you have
an unenclosed toilet...

597
00:52:50,904 --> 00:52:52,447
in proximity to a kitchen?

598
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:57,118
- A violation?
- Yes.

599
00:52:57,202 --> 00:52:59,120
And if I enclose it?

600
00:52:59,204 --> 00:53:02,082
An exhaust system
or a window is code.

601
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:05,585
Where is it?

602
00:53:05,669 --> 00:53:07,420
A friend of yours is here.

603
00:53:07,504 --> 00:53:10,590
Did you go through my pants?

604
00:53:10,674 --> 00:53:13,009
I want it back.
Where'd you put it?

605
00:53:14,594 --> 00:53:15,971
I think I may have a solution.

606
00:53:16,054 --> 00:53:18,139
Where'd you hide it?

607
00:53:18,223 --> 00:53:20,850
You're unbelievable,
you know that?

608
00:53:20,934 --> 00:53:22,102
Where is it?

609
00:53:22,185 --> 00:53:24,437
Where'd you put it,
in these shirts?

610
00:53:26,231 --> 00:53:27,691
Just tell me where it is.

611
00:53:27,774 --> 00:53:30,151
I'll look for it myself.
You don't have to...

612
00:53:30,235 --> 00:53:32,445
Would you stop that?

613
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:48,044
I want to know where it is now!

614
00:53:48,128 --> 00:53:50,171
You got no right
going through my things!

615
00:53:50,255 --> 00:53:52,299
It's an invasion of privacy.

616
00:53:54,301 --> 00:53:56,845
I need that back.
I had to work for that.

617
00:53:56,928 --> 00:54:00,849
- Doors.
- I hate to ask about the window.

618
00:54:00,932 --> 00:54:03,143
Where is it?

619
00:54:03,226 --> 00:54:04,394
I flushed it down the toilet.

620
00:54:04,477 --> 00:54:08,523
No! Oh, my God.

621
00:54:22,913 --> 00:54:27,083
If I had a gun,
I swear to God I'd kill you.

622
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:30,670
What's in my pants is none
of your fucking business.

623
00:54:30,754 --> 00:54:32,047
Look, I'd say
you're in compliance.

624
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:33,506
I hope this makes
the pain in the ass...

625
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:35,342
that called you happy.

626
00:54:35,425 --> 00:54:37,427
- You and me both.
- Bye.

627
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:40,138
Everything about you
is my business...

628
00:54:40,222 --> 00:54:43,600
what you smoke, what you sniff,
what you swallow.

629
00:54:43,683 --> 00:54:45,435
It's all my business.

630
00:54:45,518 --> 00:54:48,188
I've been using
since I was twelve!

631
00:54:48,271 --> 00:54:53,151
You're also unbelievably stupid,
you know that?

632
00:54:53,235 --> 00:54:56,404
You didn't give a shit about
anything I did up until now!

633
00:54:56,488 --> 00:54:59,824
I'll apologize
for everything but today!

634
00:54:59,908 --> 00:55:02,035
Today, I give a shit!

635
00:55:02,118 --> 00:55:03,703
Yeah? You're too fucking late.

636
00:55:03,787 --> 00:55:05,163
These gloves are for you.

637
00:55:05,247 --> 00:55:06,957
You can't make me do a thing.

638
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,959
- Sit down.
- No!

639
00:55:09,042 --> 00:55:10,210
I'll call the cops...

640
00:55:11,836 --> 00:55:13,797
Get off!

641
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,923
that's child abuse!

642
00:55:15,006 --> 00:55:16,383
You're in big shit now!

643
00:55:16,466 --> 00:55:19,803
People go to prison
for what you just did to me!

644
00:55:27,769 --> 00:55:30,105
My dad used to play this game.

645
00:55:30,188 --> 00:55:31,648
I never really even
understood what it was...

646
00:55:31,731 --> 00:55:33,233
until after he was gone.

647
00:55:33,316 --> 00:55:36,278
I was holding for somebody else.
It wasn't even mine.

648
00:55:36,361 --> 00:55:39,155
The game was to make me
smaller than he was...

649
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:41,658
smaller, always smaller.

650
00:55:41,741 --> 00:55:43,118
No matter what.

651
00:55:43,201 --> 00:55:45,120
He could be almost invisible
as a human being...

652
00:55:45,203 --> 00:55:47,539
but I still had to be smaller.

653
00:55:47,622 --> 00:55:50,166
So that if I got
good grades in school...

654
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,960
then I was a pussy
for not playing football.

655
00:55:52,043 --> 00:55:55,797
Or if I cut my hair for him,
it was never short enough.

656
00:55:55,881 --> 00:55:57,591
If I shaved my head,
then I looked like a psycho.

657
00:55:57,674 --> 00:56:00,468
I never won the game... never.

658
00:56:00,552 --> 00:56:03,096
And if he couldn't...

659
00:56:03,179 --> 00:56:06,808
make me smaller with words...

660
00:56:10,604 --> 00:56:13,231
I'll have to pay him back.

661
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,825
I won't ever hit you.

662
00:56:23,909 --> 00:56:26,328
Ever.

663
00:56:26,411 --> 00:56:27,871
I don't want you smaller.

664
00:56:27,954 --> 00:56:30,373
I want you to be happy.
You're not.

665
00:56:30,457 --> 00:56:32,626
Not here with me,
not home with your mother...

666
00:56:32,709 --> 00:56:34,586
not alone, not anywhere.

667
00:56:34,669 --> 00:56:37,297
You're what I was
most of my life, Sam.

668
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,799
I see it in your eyes,
in your sleep...

669
00:56:39,883 --> 00:56:41,509
in your answer to everything.

670
00:56:41,593 --> 00:56:44,554
You're barely alive.

671
00:56:44,638 --> 00:56:46,473
I'm not even listening.

672
00:56:46,556 --> 00:56:48,934
You know the great thing,
though?

673
00:56:49,017 --> 00:56:51,519
Is that change
can be so constant...

674
00:56:51,603 --> 00:56:53,271
that you don't even
feel the difference...

675
00:56:53,355 --> 00:56:55,941
until there is one.

676
00:56:56,024 --> 00:56:59,069
It can be so slow
that you don't know...

677
00:56:59,152 --> 00:57:04,074
that your life is better
or worse until it is.

678
00:57:04,157 --> 00:57:06,243
Or it can just blow you away...

679
00:57:06,326 --> 00:57:07,911
make you something different
in an instant.

680
00:57:11,581 --> 00:57:14,626
It happened to me.

681
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,172
Build this house with me.

682
00:57:22,551 --> 00:57:23,843
Come on.

683
00:57:38,441 --> 00:57:40,860
You fuck.

684
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:57,520
I have to pay back what
you flushed down the toilet.

685
00:58:57,604 --> 00:58:59,648
I want ten dollars an hour,
then I'm done.

686
00:59:07,781 --> 00:59:10,784
This all has to come down
before we can start again.

687
00:59:13,411 --> 00:59:15,247
Knock it down.

688
00:59:22,337 --> 00:59:26,132
I have hated this house
from the moment my father...

689
00:59:26,216 --> 00:59:27,676
put it in my name.

690
00:59:27,759 --> 00:59:31,346
Twenty-five years
of hating what you live in.

691
00:59:31,429 --> 00:59:33,473
Hating what you are.

692
00:59:33,557 --> 00:59:36,142
This is an end of it, Sam.

693
00:59:36,226 --> 00:59:39,604
Finally gonna build
something of my own.

694
00:59:39,688 --> 00:59:41,523
Something I can be proud
to give you.

695
00:59:41,606 --> 00:59:43,316
Don't.

696
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,361
- I don't want it.
- Fine.

697
00:59:46,444 --> 00:59:48,280
You can do whatever
you want with it.

698
00:59:48,363 --> 00:59:49,906
All I want is for you
to remember...

699
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:51,700
that we built a house together.

700
00:59:51,783 --> 00:59:53,910
We haven't built shit.

701
00:59:53,994 --> 00:59:56,955
You're just tearing
your father down.

702
00:59:57,038 --> 00:59:58,415
Try it. Feels good.

703
01:00:14,431 --> 01:00:15,599
Go!

704
01:00:18,435 --> 01:00:20,729
Come on!

705
01:00:29,529 --> 01:00:31,573
After you.

706
01:00:35,493 --> 01:00:37,913
It's going down.
that's it.

707
01:01:01,353 --> 01:01:02,896
Morning.

708
01:01:05,106 --> 01:01:06,900
You're up early.

709
01:02:13,008 --> 01:02:15,760
Sam, did you hear
Josh got arrested?

710
01:02:15,844 --> 01:02:17,053
His parents took his car.

711
01:02:17,137 --> 01:02:19,055
They're making him
ride a bike all summer.

712
01:02:19,139 --> 01:02:22,642
Is this like a pastime
with people? Go away.

713
01:02:22,726 --> 01:02:27,564
I've seen lots of people.
It's not a big thing for me.

714
01:02:30,233 --> 01:02:32,152
OK, could you hand me a towel?
I'm getting out.

715
01:02:32,235 --> 01:02:33,320
I'm coming in.

716
01:02:33,403 --> 01:02:35,113
I don't want you to.

717
01:02:35,196 --> 01:02:36,907
Why are you so uptight?

718
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:38,909
I'm not.

719
01:02:38,992 --> 01:02:40,911
I don't even know
what that means.

720
01:02:40,994 --> 01:02:43,955
Look, it just means
I'm gonna shampoo my hair...

721
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:45,999
and stay out of your way.

722
01:02:46,082 --> 01:02:47,167
Hand me a towel.

723
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:48,710
Please.

724
01:02:58,053 --> 01:03:00,180
You don't have to stay.

725
01:03:23,536 --> 01:03:26,081
I thought
you'd be up with the sun.

726
01:03:26,164 --> 01:03:28,375
It's my stupid back.

727
01:03:28,458 --> 01:03:32,546
What can I do, anything?

728
01:03:32,629 --> 01:03:34,881
Run to the pharmacy?

729
01:03:34,965 --> 01:03:37,217
I have some Demerol at home.

730
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,470
I took something. I'm fine.

731
01:03:50,188 --> 01:03:53,149
- Where's Sam?
- He won't use my shower.

732
01:03:53,233 --> 01:03:54,985
I don't get it.

733
01:03:56,069 --> 01:03:57,696
Come here, Guster!

734
01:03:57,779 --> 01:03:59,447
You brought your kids.

735
01:03:59,531 --> 01:04:03,034
Yeah. I kind of said that maybe
they could do something.

736
01:04:03,118 --> 01:04:05,370
You know, help.

737
01:04:05,453 --> 01:04:07,622
They really wanted to come.

738
01:04:07,706 --> 01:04:10,041
I really wanted to come.
They wanted to be with me.

739
01:04:11,751 --> 01:04:13,336
I don't think
they'll be too much trouble.

740
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:16,339
I'll find something
that won't kill 'em.

741
01:04:16,423 --> 01:04:17,549
Or wound.

742
01:04:17,632 --> 01:04:19,050
Let them keep
their eyes and fingers.

743
01:04:20,552 --> 01:04:23,305
You're a good mother, Robin.

744
01:04:24,764 --> 01:04:25,974
Do you need help?

745
01:04:26,057 --> 01:04:28,768
No, come on.

746
01:04:28,852 --> 01:04:31,271
- Yes.
- Hold on.

747
01:04:31,354 --> 01:04:32,731
Oh, God.

748
01:04:32,814 --> 01:04:34,524
Put your arm around me.
There you go.

749
01:04:34,608 --> 01:04:35,859
You don't want any breakfast?

750
01:04:35,942 --> 01:04:38,236
No, thanks.

751
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,362
Guster, come here.

752
01:04:42,616 --> 01:04:44,075
What was that for?

753
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:46,202
Mom said I should.

754
01:04:46,286 --> 01:04:48,288
I woulïve anyway.

755
01:04:48,371 --> 01:04:49,581
Who are you?

756
01:04:49,664 --> 01:04:51,875
- Who are you?
- I'm his brother.

757
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:53,168
I'm his friend.

758
01:04:53,251 --> 01:04:55,128
Mom said we could build a house.

759
01:04:55,212 --> 01:04:56,755
Hi, Alyssa.
You want to build a house?

760
01:04:56,838 --> 01:04:58,632
Hi, Mom.

761
01:04:58,715 --> 01:05:01,718
- Morning.
- Hello.

762
01:05:01,801 --> 01:05:03,637
Thanks for letting him
use your shower.

763
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,598
He's got
a standing invitation.

764
01:05:06,681 --> 01:05:08,308
So you want to build a house?

765
01:05:08,391 --> 01:05:10,268
Think it will stay up?

766
01:05:10,352 --> 01:05:12,229
I don't know.

767
01:05:25,283 --> 01:05:28,995
Wait for my signal.
Slow.

768
01:05:30,497 --> 01:05:31,665
Brace it.

769
01:05:31,748 --> 01:05:34,292
Put all your body weight
against it.

770
01:05:34,376 --> 01:05:35,710
Keep going.

771
01:05:35,794 --> 01:05:38,588
There you go.

772
01:05:38,672 --> 01:05:40,173
Well done. Perfect!

773
01:05:40,257 --> 01:05:43,343
Hey! Where should I put this?

774
01:05:45,595 --> 01:05:47,264
Sam, we need you over here.

775
01:05:53,728 --> 01:05:55,522
Adam, pass me that.

776
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:22,299
Not funny.

777
01:06:23,717 --> 01:06:25,927
- Where do you want this one?
- Right up here.

778
01:06:34,603 --> 01:06:36,897
OK, hand it up.

779
01:06:40,358 --> 01:06:42,611
Lookin' good.

780
01:06:42,694 --> 01:06:44,404
Hi, Mom!

781
01:07:00,253 --> 01:07:03,298
Hey, Mom, did you know George
before you knew Dad?

782
01:07:03,381 --> 01:07:06,968
Long before.

783
01:07:07,052 --> 01:07:10,555
Tell him how you made me
fall in love with you.

784
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:14,142
I smiled at him.

785
01:07:14,226 --> 01:07:18,730
Watch out for the smile, boys.

786
01:07:18,813 --> 01:07:21,399
- Who's up for a dance?
- Not me.

787
01:07:21,483 --> 01:07:23,026
OK, Sam.

788
01:07:23,109 --> 01:07:24,861
Les see if you remember this.

789
01:07:29,866 --> 01:07:31,034
I don't know. Maybe.

790
01:07:33,411 --> 01:07:35,747
that's a long time.

791
01:07:37,332 --> 01:07:40,001
I used to rock you
to sleep to this.

792
01:07:40,085 --> 01:07:42,462
Used to dance you to sleep.

793
01:07:42,546 --> 01:07:44,714
Come on.
Who's gonna dance with me?

794
01:07:44,798 --> 01:07:47,092
I got a lot of work to do.

795
01:07:47,175 --> 01:07:48,426
George?

796
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:50,303
No thanks.

797
01:07:50,387 --> 01:07:53,682
- Me!
- You!

798
01:07:56,518 --> 01:07:59,354
Not too tight!

799
01:08:08,363 --> 01:08:09,573
OK, that's enough for today.

800
01:08:09,656 --> 01:08:11,116
I got a lot of work to do.

801
01:08:13,034 --> 01:08:14,995
Come on, George. Les see
if you've gotten any better.

802
01:08:15,078 --> 01:08:17,956
No. Worse.

803
01:08:46,318 --> 01:08:47,986
I think I'm gonna go home.

804
01:08:48,069 --> 01:08:49,654
See you tomorrow.

805
01:09:50,715 --> 01:09:52,467
I took some of your Vicodin.

806
01:09:54,302 --> 01:09:55,345
I know.

807
01:09:58,515 --> 01:09:59,849
Why?

808
01:10:02,602 --> 01:10:06,147
I like how it feels not to feel.

809
01:10:07,315 --> 01:10:08,692
I know the feeling.

810
01:10:16,533 --> 01:10:21,204
How do you become something
that you're not?

811
01:10:21,288 --> 01:10:23,915
What would you like to be?

812
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,458
What I'm not.

813
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:27,168
What are you now?

814
01:10:27,252 --> 01:10:30,130
I'm nothin'.

815
01:10:30,213 --> 01:10:32,132
that's not true.

816
01:10:32,215 --> 01:10:34,885
You see,
that's the thing, though...

817
01:10:34,968 --> 01:10:37,762
is that I am what I say I am.

818
01:10:37,846 --> 01:10:42,017
I gave up on you.

819
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:46,021
No. If you'd given up on me,
I'd be in Tahoe right now.

820
01:10:46,104 --> 01:10:48,231
What would you be doing
there right now?

821
01:10:50,567 --> 01:10:52,861
Getting high, I guess.

822
01:10:52,944 --> 01:10:56,281
If I asked you to stop,
would you?

823
01:10:56,364 --> 01:11:02,287
I haven't used anything
in two days.

824
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:04,122
I'm trying.

825
01:11:04,206 --> 01:11:06,625
I'm proud of you.

826
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,212
Don't be.

827
01:11:13,048 --> 01:11:16,009
And hide those De...

828
01:11:16,092 --> 01:11:18,678
whatever that new drug is
you have.

829
01:11:20,513 --> 01:11:21,806
I'd like it.

830
01:11:32,943 --> 01:11:36,404
I put a gun
to my father's head once.

831
01:11:36,488 --> 01:11:38,740
You ever think like that?

832
01:11:38,823 --> 01:11:40,200
He was passed out.

833
01:11:40,283 --> 01:11:43,161
Just been yelling
at my mom over... nothing.

834
01:11:43,245 --> 01:11:44,955
Undercooked meat.

835
01:11:45,038 --> 01:11:47,165
I went to my room.

836
01:11:47,249 --> 01:11:49,334
I held the barrel
right up to his ear...

837
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:55,006
and then I chickened out again.

838
01:12:01,555 --> 01:12:02,889
Of course, it was a BB gun...

839
01:12:02,973 --> 01:12:05,100
but still,
it woulïve hurt like hell.

840
01:12:05,183 --> 01:12:07,936
Are you talking?

841
01:12:08,019 --> 01:12:09,688
I was just thinking
about my mom.

842
01:12:11,314 --> 01:12:12,899
She wouldn't leave my dad.

843
01:12:12,983 --> 01:12:17,779
I remember once she made dinner
for us wearing sunglasses.

844
01:12:17,862 --> 01:12:19,781
Mind you, it was dark outside.

845
01:12:19,864 --> 01:12:21,241
And in.

846
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:26,204
And nobody said
a thing about it.

847
01:12:28,832 --> 01:12:31,918
Why wouldn't she just leave?

848
01:12:32,002 --> 01:12:34,129
I think she was terrified...

849
01:12:34,212 --> 01:12:36,631
to live with him
but maybe even...

850
01:12:36,715 --> 01:12:38,717
more terrified of life
without him.

851
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,928
I woulïve killed him.

852
01:12:42,012 --> 01:12:45,181
Woulïve been so much better
if you had.

853
01:12:45,265 --> 01:12:49,185
Then maybe he wouldn't
have driven drunk.

854
01:12:52,230 --> 01:12:54,774
Maybe he wouldn't have killed
my mom in the car crash.

855
01:12:54,858 --> 01:12:58,653
Woman in the other car.

856
01:12:58,737 --> 01:13:03,450
Hurt a little girl
in the back seat, too.

857
01:13:03,533 --> 01:13:05,702
You'd have liked
your grandmother.

858
01:13:05,785 --> 01:13:08,288
She was pretty cool.

859
01:13:08,371 --> 01:13:11,541
I still think
about that little girl.

860
01:13:12,876 --> 01:13:15,212
They couldn't find her father,
and her mother was dead.

861
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:21,676
You ever wish you'd done it?

862
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,095
What, killed my dad?

863
01:13:26,097 --> 01:13:29,059
I loved him too much.

864
01:13:32,646 --> 01:13:34,397
that's weird.

865
01:13:40,904 --> 01:13:42,781
Yeah, I guess it is.

866
01:14:07,722 --> 01:14:09,474
You know what I've decided?

867
01:14:09,558 --> 01:14:12,519
We should take a vacation.

868
01:14:12,602 --> 01:14:14,938
Just the two of us.

869
01:14:18,984 --> 01:14:22,237
I'd love to drive through
New England in the fall.

870
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,697
Sooner than the fall.

871
01:14:31,997 --> 01:14:34,332
I'm helping George
with his house.

872
01:14:34,416 --> 01:14:37,168
What?

873
01:14:37,252 --> 01:14:39,170
I've been helping him
the last few days.

874
01:14:39,254 --> 01:14:42,632
Weeks, actually.
Sam's working.

875
01:14:42,716 --> 01:14:46,177
Well, good. that's great.

876
01:14:46,261 --> 01:14:48,722
That was the plan.

877
01:14:48,805 --> 01:14:51,391
We couldn't stand him,
and George needed help.

878
01:14:51,474 --> 01:14:54,477
I can't go right now.

879
01:14:57,230 --> 01:14:58,940
You can't go because of Sam?

880
01:15:00,942 --> 01:15:06,656
We haven't been away
together for three years.

881
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:10,118
What difference is
a few months gonna make?

882
01:15:10,201 --> 01:15:13,496
You can't go with me
because of Sam.

883
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:15,040
Sam's working at something...

884
01:15:15,123 --> 01:15:17,918
for the first time
in his entire life.

885
01:15:18,001 --> 01:15:20,086
Once in a while
he even talks to me.

886
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:21,546
I want to be around for that.

887
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:23,715
So am I, Robin.
I'm working at something, too.

888
01:15:23,798 --> 01:15:26,259
I'm even talking.
You wanna be around for that?

889
01:15:26,343 --> 01:15:29,804
I don't know.

890
01:15:43,818 --> 01:15:45,278
Hey! That is mine.

891
01:15:45,362 --> 01:15:47,030
Put that down right now!

892
01:15:48,657 --> 01:15:51,284
You are in big trouble, mister!

893
01:15:51,368 --> 01:15:52,994
You don't even understand!

894
01:15:53,078 --> 01:15:54,913
George!
I'm gonna kill you for this!

895
01:15:54,996 --> 01:15:58,291
I promise you, I'm gonna
sue you and sue your dog!

896
01:15:58,375 --> 01:16:02,379
George, you son of a bitch!
This is your fault!

897
01:16:02,462 --> 01:16:04,548
These clothes
are worth a fortune!

898
01:16:09,386 --> 01:16:11,263
What's the point of this?

899
01:16:11,346 --> 01:16:14,349
Does everything
have to have a point?

900
01:16:14,432 --> 01:16:16,768
Are you sure that
you're totally into guys?

901
01:16:16,851 --> 01:16:19,563
What are you talking about?

902
01:16:19,646 --> 01:16:21,815
I just...
Josh kind of said...

903
01:16:21,898 --> 01:16:23,817
I'm not gay.

904
01:16:25,902 --> 01:16:29,739
I mean, hello!

905
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,866
Yeah, I was wondering.

906
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:37,289
You're driving me crazy.
You know that?

907
01:16:37,372 --> 01:16:38,415
Do you know what It's like...

908
01:16:38,498 --> 01:16:40,750
trying to jack off
in an armoire?

909
01:16:40,834 --> 01:16:42,294
No, not really.

910
01:16:42,377 --> 01:16:46,172
No, you're off, you know?

911
01:16:46,256 --> 01:16:49,301
You're way off.

912
01:16:49,384 --> 01:16:51,428
Look, I thought
I was helping you.

913
01:16:53,555 --> 01:16:56,349
You'll help me
if I could kiss you.

914
01:16:58,184 --> 01:17:01,897
Look, I thought
we were just friends.

915
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:04,107
What you think you know...

916
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:07,277
doesn't necessarily
have much to do with reality.

917
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:10,655
I hope I'm not the first
to say this about you.

918
01:17:12,032 --> 01:17:13,283
All right.

919
01:17:13,366 --> 01:17:15,785
But then we're just
gonna be friends, OK?

920
01:17:40,435 --> 01:17:42,062
Yuck!

921
01:17:43,355 --> 01:17:45,899
You're scrubbing down
the shower.

922
01:17:58,537 --> 01:18:01,331
You must have
a really great husband.

923
01:18:01,414 --> 01:18:02,666
Why's that?

924
01:18:02,749 --> 01:18:04,334
No, It's just...

925
01:18:04,417 --> 01:18:06,711
I mean,
you're here every single day.

926
01:18:06,795 --> 01:18:08,880
He's at work while I'm here.

927
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:13,176
I guess I would just be jealous
if I were him.

928
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:16,388
He has nothing to worry about.

929
01:18:16,471 --> 01:18:18,848
He's not the type to worry.

930
01:18:18,932 --> 01:18:20,934
- Here you go.
- All right, les eat.

931
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:28,817
Lunch.

932
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,031
- Napkin?
- Who wants cheese?

933
01:18:35,115 --> 01:18:36,324
Me!

934
01:18:37,951 --> 01:18:40,120
Thank you.

935
01:18:41,162 --> 01:18:43,582
I'll have to find it first.

936
01:18:45,542 --> 01:18:46,751
What?

937
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,635
Nothing.

938
01:19:00,265 --> 01:19:01,725
Nothing "R," OK?

939
01:19:01,808 --> 01:19:06,021
Enough for drinks,
popcorn, and candy.

940
01:19:06,104 --> 01:19:08,565
- And video games after!
- Home after.

941
01:19:08,648 --> 01:19:11,818
- Will you come in and say hi?
- Yeah, I guess.

942
01:19:11,902 --> 01:19:13,653
Seat belt.

943
01:19:13,737 --> 01:19:15,196
Does she have to come?

944
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,948
Definitely. Here, buckle up.

945
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:24,164
I should go.

946
01:19:28,627 --> 01:19:30,212
Maybe it would be better
if you didn't come every day.

947
01:19:30,295 --> 01:19:34,216
Why? I like being with Sam.

948
01:19:34,299 --> 01:19:37,219
But there's less and less
for Ryan and Adam to do...

949
01:19:37,302 --> 01:19:40,222
and I'd hate for the boys
to be bored, you know.

950
01:19:40,305 --> 01:19:42,557
I know they don't
help much anymore...

951
01:19:42,641 --> 01:19:44,351
but they love coming here,
George.

952
01:19:44,434 --> 01:19:46,269
But...

953
01:19:49,981 --> 01:19:51,441
How much time do they get
to spend with their dad?

954
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,611
What is this?

955
01:19:54,694 --> 01:19:57,530
You know, Alyssa thinks
something's up with us.

956
01:19:57,614 --> 01:19:59,741
She keeps giving me crap
about being away from Peter...

957
01:19:59,824 --> 01:20:01,368
and now you're doing it, too.

958
01:20:01,451 --> 01:20:05,205
No one realizes
that he's not there.

959
01:20:05,288 --> 01:20:07,040
He's never there.

960
01:20:07,123 --> 01:20:10,210
Even when he is, he isn't.

961
01:20:10,293 --> 01:20:11,795
So if you don't want me here...

962
01:20:11,878 --> 01:20:13,213
or you don't want
my children here...

963
01:20:13,296 --> 01:20:16,341
then say it.

964
01:20:16,424 --> 01:20:19,094
I'll stop coming.

965
01:20:19,177 --> 01:20:20,345
But it won't be
because of Peter.

966
01:20:20,428 --> 01:20:23,098
It'll be because you told me to.

967
01:20:23,181 --> 01:20:25,141
So say what you have to say...

968
01:20:25,225 --> 01:20:26,851
because I'm not leaving
till I hear it.

969
01:20:29,062 --> 01:20:31,731
I'd rather you not be here.

970
01:20:37,028 --> 01:20:38,238
I thought we were helping.

971
01:21:08,351 --> 01:21:09,644
Is Alyssa home?

972
01:21:09,728 --> 01:21:12,731
No, she went out
with some friends.

973
01:21:12,814 --> 01:21:15,984
- What friends did she go with?
- I don't know.

974
01:21:16,067 --> 01:21:18,361
You can come in and wait,
if you'd like.

975
01:21:18,445 --> 01:21:20,196
OK. Thanks, Mrs Beck.

976
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,407
Can I get you
something to drink, Josh?

977
01:21:22,490 --> 01:21:24,784
- No, but thanks anyway.
- Alyssa may be a while.

978
01:21:24,868 --> 01:21:26,328
You sure you don't want
anything?

979
01:21:28,413 --> 01:21:30,665
Got a beer?

980
01:21:30,749 --> 01:21:33,001
A beer?

981
01:21:44,930 --> 01:21:46,097
What happened?

982
01:21:46,181 --> 01:21:48,892
Nothing is going on with us,
is it?

983
01:21:50,268 --> 01:21:52,187
Going on?

984
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:53,521
When I picked you up
from the train...

985
01:21:53,605 --> 01:21:56,233
what you said... what was that?

986
01:21:56,316 --> 01:21:58,235
What did I say?

987
01:21:58,318 --> 01:22:00,237
- You know.
- What?

988
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,949
The thing about me being
the most beautiful person.

989
01:22:04,032 --> 01:22:06,618
- What was that?
- That was the truth.

990
01:22:06,701 --> 01:22:10,288
You've never said that before.

991
01:22:10,372 --> 01:22:13,500
I might say a lot of things
I've never said before.

992
01:22:13,583 --> 01:22:15,085
Sounded like a pickup line.

993
01:22:17,546 --> 01:22:20,632
- I can't pick you up.
- 'Cause I'm married.

994
01:22:20,715 --> 01:22:22,384
You bit my finger.

995
01:22:22,467 --> 01:22:24,219
If I weren't married...

996
01:22:24,302 --> 01:22:27,222
Should we do this?

997
01:22:27,305 --> 01:22:30,517
I need to know.

998
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,519
What?

999
01:22:32,602 --> 01:22:35,480
Do I still love you?

1000
01:22:35,564 --> 01:22:38,650
Absolutely.

1001
01:22:47,492 --> 01:22:50,328
There's not a doubt in my mind.

1002
01:22:50,412 --> 01:22:53,582
Through all my anger, my ego...

1003
01:22:53,665 --> 01:22:56,835
I was always faithful
in my love for you.

1004
01:22:56,918 --> 01:23:00,881
That I made you doubt it...

1005
01:23:00,964 --> 01:23:06,887
that is the great mistake
of a life full of mistakes.

1006
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:09,180
The truth doesn't
set us free, Robin.

1007
01:23:09,264 --> 01:23:10,807
I can tell you I love you...

1008
01:23:10,891 --> 01:23:13,518
as many times
as you can stand to hear it...

1009
01:23:13,602 --> 01:23:15,103
and all that does,
the only thing...

1010
01:23:15,186 --> 01:23:19,232
is remind us...
Iove is not enough.

1011
01:23:19,316 --> 01:23:23,111
Not even close.

1012
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:04,236
No, these aren't for you.

1013
01:24:25,715 --> 01:24:28,134
All I am is what I have.

1014
01:24:28,218 --> 01:24:31,263
God, it sounds pathetic,
doesn't it?

1015
01:24:36,309 --> 01:24:37,852
What are you doing home?

1016
01:24:39,854 --> 01:24:41,314
I always felt
that I could never marry...

1017
01:24:41,398 --> 01:24:44,067
without first showing you
what a fabulous life...

1018
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:46,444
you could live despite me.

1019
01:24:46,528 --> 01:24:48,238
You never really trusted me.

1020
01:24:48,321 --> 01:24:51,157
We live a fabulous life, Robin.

1021
01:24:51,241 --> 01:24:52,826
Despite you.

1022
01:24:55,412 --> 01:24:56,788
Where are the kids?

1023
01:24:56,872 --> 01:24:59,291
Sam took 'em to a movie.

1024
01:25:04,004 --> 01:25:07,924
I'll be in the bedroom.

1025
01:25:47,255 --> 01:25:48,924
I fell asleep.

1026
01:25:52,761 --> 01:25:56,223
I need to ask you something,
Mr Monroe.

1027
01:25:56,306 --> 01:25:59,517
Do you need to ask me like that?

1028
01:26:00,727 --> 01:26:03,855
I want you to try something.
With me.

1029
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:07,859
I'm on a lot of morphine
right now.

1030
01:26:07,943 --> 01:26:10,946
Oral morphine for my back.

1031
01:26:11,029 --> 01:26:14,074
Can it wait till I can say no
and sound convincing?

1032
01:26:33,301 --> 01:26:34,803
Did you feel anything?

1033
01:26:38,557 --> 01:26:41,393
Maybe a tongue.

1034
01:26:41,476 --> 01:26:44,229
My mouth is numb.
I'm not sure.

1035
01:26:47,857 --> 01:26:49,109
Why did you do that?

1036
01:26:49,192 --> 01:26:55,532
When you were dating my mom,
I saw you kiss her once, and...

1037
01:26:55,615 --> 01:26:58,118
you look like
such a good kisser.

1038
01:27:01,705 --> 01:27:04,833
My mom would die.

1039
01:27:04,916 --> 01:27:06,751
Les shut up and let her live.

1040
01:27:06,835 --> 01:27:09,254
Mrs Beck!

1041
01:27:13,174 --> 01:27:16,636
It's not what I was expecting.

1042
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:18,305
What did you think it would be?

1043
01:27:18,388 --> 01:27:20,557
I don't know.

1044
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:24,853
More like when I kiss Sam.

1045
01:27:24,936 --> 01:27:27,689
Yeah, more like that.

1046
01:27:27,772 --> 01:27:29,774
Thanks for your time, then.

1047
01:27:44,414 --> 01:27:45,790
Mom?

1048
01:27:47,042 --> 01:27:50,128
- Oh, God.
- Get dressed.

1049
01:27:50,212 --> 01:27:51,838
- Get dressed now!
- Where are my clothes?

1050
01:27:51,922 --> 01:27:54,716
Did you know the alarm is on?

1051
01:27:56,259 --> 01:27:59,387
Mom! Where are you?

1052
01:28:05,352 --> 01:28:06,561
In here, honey.

1053
01:28:13,068 --> 01:28:14,444
What are you guys doing?

1054
01:28:14,527 --> 01:28:16,363
I... put him to work.

1055
01:28:18,073 --> 01:28:21,326
Good. It's fixed.

1056
01:28:23,954 --> 01:28:26,248
- Go!
- I'm going!

1057
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:32,254
I got to play one video game
for three hours straight!

1058
01:28:32,337 --> 01:28:36,800
There were no PGs, so I just
gave 'em money for video games.

1059
01:28:36,883 --> 01:28:38,301
Go tell your dad dinner's ready.

1060
01:28:38,385 --> 01:28:40,845
He's in the bedroom.

1061
01:28:41,888 --> 01:28:44,432
Are you staying for dinner?

1062
01:28:44,516 --> 01:28:46,309
Depends on what I'd give up on.

1063
01:28:46,393 --> 01:28:48,645
Lasagna.

1064
01:28:48,728 --> 01:28:50,897
See, that's a trap.

1065
01:28:52,774 --> 01:28:54,192
He's not there.

1066
01:28:57,153 --> 01:28:58,196
No, he's not.

1067
01:29:02,576 --> 01:29:03,785
Hey! Wait!

1068
01:29:05,245 --> 01:29:08,039
Get! Go on!
I'm gonna get you.

1069
01:29:08,123 --> 01:29:10,876
The man has never changed
from the day we moved in.

1070
01:29:10,959 --> 01:29:13,587
Mind your own fucking business.

1071
01:29:13,670 --> 01:29:15,797
Tom, get in the car.

1072
01:29:17,799 --> 01:29:19,050
Do you believe that?

1073
01:29:53,752 --> 01:29:55,837
- Hello?
- I don't see Alyssa.

1074
01:29:55,921 --> 01:29:58,882
Just please open the door
when I knock.

1075
01:29:58,965 --> 01:30:01,092
Just come on up.

1076
01:30:14,856 --> 01:30:18,818
- What are you doing?
- I was wondering...

1077
01:30:18,902 --> 01:30:22,656
if you'd like to go for a ride?

1078
01:30:22,739 --> 01:30:24,866
Do you want to help us out?

1079
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:27,994
George is paying Sam
ten dollars an hour.

1080
01:30:28,078 --> 01:30:31,289
Three hundred cash,
two hours, that's it.

1081
01:30:31,373 --> 01:30:32,666
What?

1082
01:30:32,749 --> 01:30:36,294
It's just a joke.
Just a stupid joke.

1083
01:30:36,378 --> 01:30:38,380
Very funny.

1084
01:30:46,137 --> 01:30:50,225
Is your back still killing you?

1085
01:30:53,436 --> 01:30:57,983
I didn't expect you today.

1086
01:30:59,609 --> 01:31:02,279
I kept thinking about
what you said, and...

1087
01:31:05,574 --> 01:31:10,871
I hope you're trying to make me
stay away for my own sake.

1088
01:31:10,954 --> 01:31:14,040
No, it was actually more for me.

1089
01:31:18,169 --> 01:31:19,754
Peter left me.

1090
01:31:21,464 --> 01:31:24,426
Left you?

1091
01:31:24,509 --> 01:31:27,095
No "Fuck you."
No "Good-bye."

1092
01:31:27,178 --> 01:31:30,515
No "Are you in love
with George?"

1093
01:31:34,769 --> 01:31:36,479
What did he say?

1094
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:41,109
"I'll be in the bedroom."

1095
01:31:41,192 --> 01:31:46,615
I couldn't walk in there,
so he left.

1096
01:31:59,169 --> 01:32:02,339
Hey, Dad,
the electrician needs to know...

1097
01:32:04,341 --> 01:32:06,092
I... your mother...

1098
01:32:06,176 --> 01:32:08,887
- I had a kink in my...
- In his neck.

1099
01:32:08,970 --> 01:32:10,555
- Back.
- His back.

1100
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:12,182
The door was open.

1101
01:32:12,265 --> 01:32:13,850
I don't know what I'm doing.

1102
01:32:13,934 --> 01:32:15,227
I was...

1103
01:32:15,310 --> 01:32:18,438
I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan
see you doing this.

1104
01:32:18,521 --> 01:32:19,981
It won't happen again.

1105
01:32:20,065 --> 01:32:24,653
Well, Dale wants to know if we
should run an outside line...

1106
01:32:24,736 --> 01:32:27,656
for Christmas lights
with a switch inside.

1107
01:32:27,739 --> 01:32:29,824
Absolutely. Have him put it
on a separate line.

1108
01:32:29,908 --> 01:32:31,368
We'll...
Christmas time...

1109
01:32:31,451 --> 01:32:32,619
we'll pack it
so full of lights...

1110
01:32:32,702 --> 01:32:34,579
the neighbours
will need sunglasses.

1111
01:32:40,585 --> 01:32:44,589
Oh, God, I could die.

1112
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:48,802
Yeah. Me, too.

1113
01:32:55,767 --> 01:32:57,686
Are you going to kiss me?

1114
01:33:03,733 --> 01:33:06,278
It's...

1115
01:33:06,361 --> 01:33:08,780
It's not my back
that's killing me.

1116
01:34:04,836 --> 01:34:08,381
Well, hello. How are you?

1117
01:34:12,969 --> 01:34:16,765
George, I've recruited help
for the roof.

1118
01:34:16,848 --> 01:34:19,100
Hi. George Monroe.

1119
01:34:19,184 --> 01:34:20,393
Me, too.

1120
01:34:22,437 --> 01:34:23,980
See you.

1121
01:34:25,148 --> 01:34:27,108
Next.

1122
01:34:27,192 --> 01:34:29,986
I just wanted to know
where my mom was.

1123
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:33,114
I think she needs
to be alone right now.

1124
01:34:33,198 --> 01:34:34,950
Because Dad left?

1125
01:34:35,033 --> 01:34:36,868
It's just a little sad,
that's all.

1126
01:34:36,952 --> 01:34:39,788
I don't care
if he ever comes back.

1127
01:34:46,086 --> 01:34:47,295
Here you go.

1128
01:34:50,173 --> 01:34:52,092
Josh, you look like
you need a hug.

1129
01:34:52,175 --> 01:34:53,843
I'm OK.

1130
01:34:59,516 --> 01:35:01,268
Dale.

1131
01:35:01,351 --> 01:35:03,144
Don't even think about it.

1132
01:35:03,228 --> 01:35:04,479
They got me started.

1133
01:35:04,563 --> 01:35:08,275
Look, I will shock you so bad
your tongue will turn black.

1134
01:35:36,177 --> 01:35:39,139
OK, les keep going.
Knock another hole.

1135
01:35:40,891 --> 01:35:42,976
220, right up in here.

1136
01:35:43,059 --> 01:35:44,936
Would you get that for me,
please?

1137
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:46,438
Just let mine ring.

1138
01:35:49,858 --> 01:35:51,067
I don't know...

1139
01:35:56,198 --> 01:35:57,449
What are you doing?

1140
01:35:57,532 --> 01:36:00,368
You are driving me crazy
waiting like this.

1141
01:36:00,452 --> 01:36:03,663
I want you in my bed now.

1142
01:36:11,963 --> 01:36:14,966
- Is it mine?
- I hope not.

1143
01:36:16,676 --> 01:36:18,136
Shit.

1144
01:36:22,933 --> 01:36:24,476
Oh, my God! Are you OK?

1145
01:36:24,559 --> 01:36:27,896
- I'm OK.
- Don't move.

1146
01:36:27,979 --> 01:36:30,482
- No, I'm fine.
- Where does it hurt?

1147
01:36:30,565 --> 01:36:31,816
Watch out.

1148
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:34,694
- I heard a scream.
- Josh fell.

1149
01:36:34,778 --> 01:36:36,154
Is that a bone sticking out?

1150
01:36:36,238 --> 01:36:38,532
- Don't move your neck.
- I'm going to call an ambulance.

1151
01:36:38,615 --> 01:36:41,493
- Lf I could just stand up.
- Stay there.

1152
01:36:41,576 --> 01:36:43,745
No, I'm fine. I'm OK.

1153
01:36:55,257 --> 01:37:00,345
A leg, two fingers, one rib,
and a mild concussion.

1154
01:37:00,428 --> 01:37:03,181
Not bad, considering the height.

1155
01:37:06,184 --> 01:37:08,144
Not a perfect day.

1156
01:37:10,605 --> 01:37:13,817
I should get the kids home.

1157
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:15,193
Come on.

1158
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:22,784
- See you.
- Anytime.

1159
01:37:27,163 --> 01:37:28,623
Seat belt.

1160
01:37:58,195 --> 01:38:01,573
You look like shit lately,
you know?

1161
01:38:01,656 --> 01:38:03,783
You're looking better than ever.

1162
01:38:07,370 --> 01:38:11,791
I don't think Mom cares
that much that Peter left.

1163
01:38:13,210 --> 01:38:14,753
She seemed upset.

1164
01:38:18,131 --> 01:38:20,175
What's wrong with your back?

1165
01:38:24,888 --> 01:38:26,431
Do you have to have
surgery on it or what?

1166
01:38:26,514 --> 01:38:30,018
Because those pills that you're
taking are for a lot of pain.

1167
01:38:30,101 --> 01:38:33,188
And you seem to be going through
them pretty quick, that's all.

1168
01:38:35,106 --> 01:38:36,691
You're not still taking any,
are you?

1169
01:38:36,775 --> 01:38:40,111
No. But I count them.

1170
01:38:40,195 --> 01:38:43,490
In a sock isn't exactly new,
you know.

1171
01:38:49,829 --> 01:38:52,290
I'm having a problem
with cancer.

1172
01:39:01,174 --> 01:39:06,054
I don't know what that means.

1173
01:39:06,137 --> 01:39:07,639
What kind of a problem?

1174
01:39:07,722 --> 01:39:11,268
The kind where
there isn't any answer.

1175
01:39:13,436 --> 01:39:15,772
I still don't know
what it means.

1176
01:39:18,191 --> 01:39:22,195
Sam, I wanted us to... oh, God.

1177
01:39:22,279 --> 01:39:26,783
You know,
spend a few months together.

1178
01:39:28,785 --> 01:39:31,121
Here.

1179
01:39:31,204 --> 01:39:33,123
Sometimes things happen
for a reason.

1180
01:39:33,206 --> 01:39:36,543
Something bad
to force something good.

1181
01:39:41,798 --> 01:39:44,009
So you're dying.

1182
01:39:47,888 --> 01:39:50,181
And you told Mom today.

1183
01:40:01,818 --> 01:40:03,695
Fuck you.

1184
01:40:18,210 --> 01:40:21,713
You knew you were dying
from the start?

1185
01:40:21,796 --> 01:40:23,548
We're all dying from the start.

1186
01:40:23,632 --> 01:40:25,800
I just got moved
to the head of the line.

1187
01:40:25,884 --> 01:40:28,511
But you lied to me.

1188
01:40:28,595 --> 01:40:32,182
I woulïve lied to myself
if I thought I'd believe it.

1189
01:40:32,265 --> 01:40:34,517
So this whole thing...

1190
01:40:34,601 --> 01:40:39,189
this whole summer, having
me here, was for your sake.

1191
01:40:40,732 --> 01:40:42,943
You selfish fuck.

1192
01:40:45,028 --> 01:40:47,781
Having me here,
trying to get me to like you.

1193
01:40:47,864 --> 01:40:53,119
No, Sam. I wasn't trying
to get you to like me.

1194
01:40:53,203 --> 01:40:56,248
I was trying to get you
to love me.

1195
01:40:56,331 --> 01:40:58,124
Well, congratulations...

1196
01:40:58,208 --> 01:41:01,545
because you fucking
pulled it off.

1197
01:41:20,272 --> 01:41:22,399
Hi. Is Alyssa home?

1198
01:41:22,482 --> 01:41:24,192
It's really late.

1199
01:41:24,276 --> 01:41:26,736
What's the matter, Sam?

1200
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:28,071
Nothing.

1201
01:41:30,198 --> 01:41:32,659
My daïs dying.

1202
01:41:35,161 --> 01:41:36,830
I really need to talk to Alyssa.

1203
01:41:40,709 --> 01:41:42,794
Sam, you OK?

1204
01:42:57,244 --> 01:42:58,495
My day off.

1205
01:43:00,497 --> 01:43:03,291
Thought I'd help out
with the plumbing.

1206
01:43:03,375 --> 01:43:05,085
Maybe I'll fix that shower
for you.

1207
01:43:05,168 --> 01:43:06,378
Thanks.

1208
01:43:08,838 --> 01:43:10,382
I have a favour to ask.

1209
01:43:10,465 --> 01:43:12,259
You look like crap, George.

1210
01:43:12,342 --> 01:43:15,512
I want you to find someone
for me.

1211
01:43:15,595 --> 01:43:17,931
Find somebody?

1212
01:43:18,014 --> 01:43:20,141
Yeah. I have
some unfinished business.

1213
01:43:26,273 --> 01:43:28,275
Mr Monroe?

1214
01:43:33,446 --> 01:43:35,198
You're relentless.

1215
01:43:35,282 --> 01:43:38,201
Mr Monroe, one of
your neighbours is adamant...

1216
01:43:38,285 --> 01:43:40,328
that your home exceeds
its approved height...

1217
01:43:40,412 --> 01:43:42,622
and he's filed to have
construction stopped...

1218
01:43:42,706 --> 01:43:44,374
immediately.

1219
01:43:44,457 --> 01:43:46,126
It's twenty-five feet.

1220
01:43:46,209 --> 01:43:47,961
If it is, we have a problem.

1221
01:43:48,044 --> 01:43:49,212
I have the permit.

1222
01:43:49,296 --> 01:43:51,131
After your last
extension request...

1223
01:43:51,214 --> 01:43:52,757
and your appeals
to city council...

1224
01:43:52,841 --> 01:43:55,010
was there an amended permit?

1225
01:43:55,093 --> 01:43:59,556
Yes... for the patio,
the air conditioning unit...

1226
01:44:02,684 --> 01:44:04,728
and six inches to the height.

1227
01:44:06,062 --> 01:44:07,898
David Dokos.

1228
01:44:07,981 --> 01:44:11,109
Why do you let your dog crap
on his lawn day after day?

1229
01:44:11,193 --> 01:44:15,197
I don't let him.
He just loves to.

1230
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:17,532
He'll make you tear
the entire roof off...

1231
01:44:17,616 --> 01:44:19,367
before he'll give you
any satisfaction.

1232
01:44:19,451 --> 01:44:22,746
Look, I'm afraid you're going
to have to stop all this...

1233
01:44:22,829 --> 01:44:24,206
until you get things settled.

1234
01:44:24,289 --> 01:44:25,874
You can always go back
and file an appeal.

1235
01:44:25,957 --> 01:44:27,918
that'll take weeks.

1236
01:44:28,001 --> 01:44:30,253
Months.

1237
01:44:31,463 --> 01:44:33,757
Just so you know, we will be
working on this house...

1238
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,675
tomorrow and the next day
and the day after...

1239
01:44:35,759 --> 01:44:36,968
until It's finished.

1240
01:44:37,052 --> 01:44:39,512
He'll call us again,
and then he'll call the police.

1241
01:44:39,596 --> 01:44:41,598
He has an attorney on retainer.

1242
01:44:41,681 --> 01:44:43,975
Just so you know.

1243
01:44:45,268 --> 01:44:48,647
If he hears a hammer,
he'll have you arrested.

1244
01:44:48,730 --> 01:44:52,776
You heard the lady.

1245
01:45:08,375 --> 01:45:09,668
I'm going to go to bed.

1246
01:45:09,751 --> 01:45:12,754
Has he eaten anything at all?

1247
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:18,760
I'd be more comfortable
if he slept in the guest room.

1248
01:45:20,387 --> 01:45:23,848
I'd be more comfortable
if you hadn't slept with Josh.

1249
01:45:23,932 --> 01:45:28,228
George would be more
comfortable if he wasn't dying.

1250
01:46:32,083 --> 01:46:33,418
Sam, there's, like,
twenty people...

1251
01:46:33,501 --> 01:46:36,421
working on your daïs house
right now.

1252
01:46:39,382 --> 01:46:41,343
If it was my father,
I'd want to spend...

1253
01:46:41,426 --> 01:46:44,346
every single second with him.

1254
01:46:44,429 --> 01:46:46,723
You hate your father.

1255
01:46:46,806 --> 01:46:50,018
If he tricked me into
loving him is what I meant.

1256
01:46:51,978 --> 01:46:55,357
You'd hate him for the trick.

1257
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:58,235
Not if what he left me was real.

1258
01:47:17,420 --> 01:47:20,215
We pulled this crew
off a tract at Newport.

1259
01:47:20,298 --> 01:47:21,466
They're the best.

1260
01:47:21,550 --> 01:47:23,176
They'll stick with it
till It's done.

1261
01:47:23,260 --> 01:47:25,262
What's going on?

1262
01:47:25,345 --> 01:47:28,306
- I hired some help.
- Why?

1263
01:47:28,390 --> 01:47:29,724
Atonement.

1264
01:47:29,808 --> 01:47:31,810
Mom.

1265
01:47:31,893 --> 01:47:33,103
Where's George?

1266
01:47:33,186 --> 01:47:34,980
I think he's still sleeping.

1267
01:47:35,063 --> 01:47:37,023
Who are all these people?

1268
01:47:37,107 --> 01:47:39,401
I thought he needed some help.

1269
01:47:50,871 --> 01:47:52,205
George, wake up.

1270
01:47:55,876 --> 01:47:58,420
You're still warm. Wake up.

1271
01:47:58,503 --> 01:48:00,380
Stop licking me.

1272
01:48:06,261 --> 01:48:08,138
They're taking your dad
to the hospital.

1273
01:48:34,998 --> 01:48:36,416
Guster.

1274
01:48:41,046 --> 01:48:43,965
Hey, Guster.

1275
01:48:44,049 --> 01:48:46,218
- Hey, boy.
- I just stopped down.

1276
01:48:46,301 --> 01:48:48,470
If you're hungry,
maybe we could...

1277
01:49:10,283 --> 01:49:12,035
You doing OK?

1278
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:26,299
And we got to take
all the old paint off.

1279
01:49:26,383 --> 01:49:28,677
He even let me choose
the colour I like best.

1280
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:30,053
He said he loved me.

1281
01:49:30,136 --> 01:49:33,223
And I got to drill a hole
through a board...

1282
01:49:33,306 --> 01:49:34,516
to put the wire through.

1283
01:49:34,599 --> 01:49:37,561
I've never seen you
so excited about anything.

1284
01:49:37,644 --> 01:49:39,229
Maybe you can help, too.

1285
01:49:39,312 --> 01:49:41,898
I'd like that.

1286
01:50:38,455 --> 01:50:40,165
that's good.

1287
01:50:40,248 --> 01:50:41,750
Excuse me.

1288
01:50:41,833 --> 01:50:44,461
I'm afraid no one's
allowed in there now.

1289
01:50:44,544 --> 01:50:46,338
that's my father.

1290
01:51:33,134 --> 01:51:35,262
How you feeling?

1291
01:51:38,848 --> 01:51:40,350
How are you?

1292
01:51:40,433 --> 01:51:42,686
- You're wet.
- I know.

1293
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:46,898
Why?

1294
01:51:46,982 --> 01:51:48,650
I went for a small swim.

1295
01:51:53,446 --> 01:51:55,407
I want to show you something.

1296
01:52:09,170 --> 01:52:12,424
Well, It's almost finished.

1297
01:52:25,937 --> 01:52:27,397
Finish it, Sam.

1298
01:52:38,658 --> 01:52:40,285
I want you to go
straight to bed.

1299
01:52:40,368 --> 01:52:41,620
It's late.

1300
01:52:44,956 --> 01:52:46,583
Do you know anything
about building a house?

1301
01:52:46,666 --> 01:52:47,834
Nope.

1302
01:52:47,918 --> 01:52:51,254
I guess I could
teach you a few things.

1303
01:52:56,968 --> 01:52:58,136
Sweet dreams.

1304
01:53:01,806 --> 01:53:03,725
- Keys.
- Keys.

1305
01:53:07,938 --> 01:53:09,481
You look different.

1306
01:53:09,564 --> 01:53:12,192
That was my plan.

1307
01:53:12,275 --> 01:53:15,111
Be hardly recognizable to you.

1308
01:53:15,195 --> 01:53:16,404
that's me.

1309
01:53:18,740 --> 01:53:20,575
I fell in love
with George again.

1310
01:53:27,332 --> 01:53:28,583
I'll see you tomorrow.

1311
01:53:46,726 --> 01:53:49,354
Where were you?

1312
01:53:49,437 --> 01:53:52,190
- Floating to Catalina.
- What?

1313
01:53:52,274 --> 01:53:53,483
You got something.

1314
01:53:56,486 --> 01:53:59,489
He said he heard hammering.

1315
01:53:59,573 --> 01:54:01,324
Who?

1316
01:54:01,408 --> 01:54:02,576
My attorney's driving down
from Newport Beach...

1317
01:54:02,659 --> 01:54:04,870
and I just want you all
to know that if I hear...

1318
01:54:04,953 --> 01:54:06,496
so much as one more nail
being hammered...

1319
01:54:06,580 --> 01:54:08,999
I swear to God, by the time
this whole thing's over...

1320
01:54:09,082 --> 01:54:10,458
I'm gonna own this house.

1321
01:54:10,542 --> 01:54:12,252
Mr Dokos claims your father...

1322
01:54:12,335 --> 01:54:14,629
missed his height envelope
by six inches.

1323
01:54:14,713 --> 01:54:17,674
He wants the whole roof
taken down and lowered.

1324
01:54:21,303 --> 01:54:22,470
Wait a minute.

1325
01:54:26,141 --> 01:54:29,728
Do you drive a black Lexus?

1326
01:54:34,274 --> 01:54:35,984
that's not your car out
in the driveway right there?

1327
01:54:40,113 --> 01:54:42,866
I'm going back to my house
to wait for my lawyer.

1328
01:54:42,949 --> 01:54:45,702
Are you sure we need lawyers?

1329
01:54:45,785 --> 01:54:48,872
I mean, all we're talking
about is six inches, right?

1330
01:54:51,917 --> 01:54:54,920
Officer, I think we should
just forget all about this.

1331
01:54:58,548 --> 01:55:00,425
What the fuck?

1332
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:06,181
Everything happens for a reason.
that's what my father says.

1333
01:55:06,264 --> 01:55:07,557
Want to give me a hand?

1334
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:17,192
The waves.

1335
01:55:17,275 --> 01:55:18,735
He loves it.

1336
01:55:18,818 --> 01:55:21,071
There's a big one.

1337
01:55:22,822 --> 01:55:24,699
He's holding on so tight.

1338
01:55:30,205 --> 01:55:32,791
He's so scared but loving it.

1339
01:55:40,757 --> 01:55:43,426
He had salt in his eyes,
I think.

1340
01:55:46,429 --> 01:55:48,640
You're kissing him.

1341
01:55:50,684 --> 01:55:53,353
You're spinning him right now.

1342
01:55:53,436 --> 01:55:54,855
He loved that.

1343
01:55:56,439 --> 01:55:58,108
I remember.

1344
01:55:59,985 --> 01:56:01,611
You were happy.

1345
01:56:07,284 --> 01:56:09,369
Here comes a big one!

1346
01:56:19,462 --> 01:56:20,964
Really big.

1347
01:56:48,742 --> 01:56:49,951
It's almost done.

1348
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:53,914
I thought maybe
I could help, but...

1349
01:56:55,165 --> 01:56:57,042
Iooks like you got
all you can handle.

1350
01:57:00,128 --> 01:57:01,880
We could always use
an extra set of hands.

1351
01:57:17,479 --> 01:57:19,439
You sure we can't call anyone?

1352
01:57:42,879 --> 01:57:44,089
Hi, Mom.

1353
01:57:52,472 --> 01:57:53,932
Is George OK?

1354
01:58:14,661 --> 01:58:17,414
I always thought of myself
as a house.

1355
01:58:17,497 --> 01:58:19,875
I was always what I lived in.

1356
01:58:19,958 --> 01:58:21,376
It didn't need to be big.

1357
01:58:21,459 --> 01:58:23,253
It didn't even need
to be beautiful.

1358
01:58:23,336 --> 01:58:25,672
It just needed to be mine.

1359
01:58:25,755 --> 01:58:28,925
I became what I was meant to be.

1360
01:58:29,009 --> 01:58:31,261
I built myself a life.

1361
01:58:32,512 --> 01:58:35,056
I built myself a house.

1362
01:58:35,140 --> 01:58:36,766
Second trailer on your right.

1363
01:58:36,850 --> 01:58:38,101
Thank you.

1364
01:58:40,812 --> 01:58:43,398
Are you sure
you want to do this?

1365
01:58:44,858 --> 01:58:47,485
You could keep it
and rent it out.

1366
01:58:47,569 --> 01:58:49,196
This is what he wanted.

1367
01:58:51,865 --> 01:58:53,742
I read the letter.
You read the will.

1368
01:58:53,825 --> 01:58:58,330
He wanted you to keep it
and live in it someday.

1369
01:58:58,413 --> 01:59:00,373
All right, maybe
It's not what he wanted...

1370
01:59:00,457 --> 01:59:02,459
but It's what he was hoping for.

1371
01:59:05,921 --> 01:59:07,464
Maybe It's what I want.

1372
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:18,141
Twenty-nine years ago my father
crossed a double line.

1373
01:59:18,225 --> 01:59:19,392
Excuse me.

1374
01:59:19,476 --> 01:59:20,936
Changed my life...

1375
01:59:21,019 --> 01:59:24,231
and the life of a little girl
forever with that mistake.

1376
01:59:24,314 --> 01:59:25,690
- Hello.
- that's my mom.

1377
01:59:25,774 --> 01:59:27,692
Just can't stop
thinking about her.

1378
01:59:27,776 --> 01:59:30,445
Do you mind if we steal
just a moment of your time?

1379
01:59:30,529 --> 01:59:33,406
Have a seat.

1380
01:59:33,490 --> 01:59:34,699
Thank you.

1381
01:59:39,788 --> 01:59:41,790
My father built you a house.

1382
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:45,335
I don't understand.

1383
01:59:48,463 --> 01:59:53,426
My father's family had a car
accident with your family...

1384
02:00:02,477 --> 02:00:07,065
With every crash of every wave,
I hear something now.

1385
02:00:07,148 --> 02:00:09,025
I never listened before.

1386
02:00:11,152 --> 02:00:14,489
I'm on the edge of a cliff,
listening.

1387
02:00:15,949 --> 02:00:17,367
Almost finished.

1388
02:00:30,672 --> 02:00:32,507
If you were a house, Sam...

1389
02:00:32,591 --> 02:00:35,260
this is where
you would want to be built.

1390
02:00:35,343 --> 02:00:41,266
On rock, facing the sea...
listening.

1391
02:00:54,112 --> 02:00:58,992
