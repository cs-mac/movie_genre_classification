1
00:01:14,342 --> 00:01:16,710
I have already taken a shower

2
00:01:17,114 --> 00:01:19,106
What about you?

3
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,211
We need to be quick today

4
00:01:22,356 --> 00:01:25,520
I got a dinner date

5
00:01:26,863 --> 00:01:29,527
The same price as always, $1,000

6
00:01:32,238 --> 00:01:34,332
You can go for dinner now

7
00:01:34,742 --> 00:01:36,643
Here is some money for taxi

8
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,642
What's wrong?

9
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,548
I can't make love in a hurry

10
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:45,654
No, I didn't mean that

11
00:04:17,937 --> 00:04:18,904
Good evening, boss

12
00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:21,898
Good evening, boss

13
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:27,417
"Golden Basin Foot Massage Palace"

14
00:04:28,053 --> 00:04:28,713
Good evening, boss

15
00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:33,417
Sha Sha, bring some drinks to my office

16
00:04:33,528 --> 00:04:33,926
Okay

17
00:04:55,864 --> 00:04:57,697
Can you my age by touching?

18
00:04:58,769 --> 00:04:59,668
You are kidding me

19
00:05:07,716 --> 00:05:10,482
He likes dealing with student girls

20
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:15,087
It's just a normal relation

21
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:21,634
This guy really sucks

22
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:24,002
Yeah, they're all the same nowadays

23
00:05:26,913 --> 00:05:29,509
Alright, l'll give you another
massage later

24
00:05:29,818 --> 00:05:32,254
My back hufts

25
00:05:32,523 --> 00:05:34,151
Well, let's work on it later

26
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:37,721
Discard your hand!

27
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:43,028
Throw your hand away

28
00:05:44,642 --> 00:05:45,040
See who wins

29
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,151
Look at it and throw your hand away

30
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:51,275
Show your hand!

31
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:52,144
Show it!

32
00:05:52,856 --> 00:05:53,845
You must have lost

33
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:57,085
Look at your third card!

34
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:00,967
Show your hand!

35
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:02,001
Jerk!

36
00:06:07,078 --> 00:06:08,307
This is really great

37
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,577
Watch out, I got AIDS

38
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:11,913
You got AIDS?

39
00:06:12,086 --> 00:06:13,314
So what about AIDS?

40
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:15,624
It only confirms your sexual prowess

41
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,691
Is that so?

42
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:17,283
Yeah

43
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:20,294
We are not bad either

44
00:06:21,702 --> 00:06:24,900
Not there, it's here, here

45
00:06:29,614 --> 00:06:30,707
Don't mess around

46
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,143
I thought you'd fallen asleep

47
00:06:32,352 --> 00:06:33,216
Get up

48
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,014
No, I didn't...

49
00:06:34,121 --> 00:06:35,851
Let me give you a back massage

50
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:43,261
Is it that bad?

51
00:06:57,258 --> 00:06:58,282
Thank you, Mr. Zhou

52
00:06:58,661 --> 00:07:00,185
Come to see me next time

53
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:06,300
I've got five customers

54
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:07,972
Already five?

55
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:08,973
Four

56
00:07:09,077 --> 00:07:10,375
Actually how many?

57
00:07:10,714 --> 00:07:11,772
Four

58
00:07:11,882 --> 00:07:12,872
Only four?

59
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:13,882
I've got eight

60
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:14,918
How come you have so few?

61
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:16,385
Pingguo, take a puff

62
00:07:17,123 --> 00:07:17,885
Quick

63
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:19,926
I'm cutting her hair

64
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,099
I want to buy an apaftment

65
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:24,825
Stop day-dreaming

66
00:07:26,138 --> 00:07:28,039
Can you get me that comb?

67
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,234
With only four customers a day?

68
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:31,400
I meant at our hometown

69
00:07:31,714 --> 00:07:33,204
Silly girl

70
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,418
You have a long way to go

71
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:39,352
A guy who washes cars across the street

72
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:42,219
The one with the long face

73
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,062
He wants to date me tonight

74
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:53,472
How can I trick him to think I'm still a virgin?

75
00:07:56,754 --> 00:07:58,245
Tell me, tell me

76
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,882
Just go buy yourself a cherry

77
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:02,153
Where can I buy one?

78
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:04,892
Everywhere, it's cheap

79
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:06,100
Tell me where?

80
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:07,760
How should I know?

81
00:08:21,427 --> 00:08:23,293
Oh, brushing your teeth?

82
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:31,107
Try some of this

83
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,252
Oh, it dropped

84
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:44,427
Don't you ever come to see me at work

85
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:47,466
If my boss knows that I'm married,
I'm finished

86
00:08:47,836 --> 00:08:49,326
I never go there

87
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,866
Yeah right, I saw you once at
the entrance

88
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:02,547
You spilled on your shift

89
00:09:24,393 --> 00:09:26,488
You didn't flip the cover again?

90
00:09:26,898 --> 00:09:28,332
What are you doing in here?

91
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,196
I want to take a shower

92
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,929
Wait a second, let me out first

93
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:34,201
Let me out

94
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,641
Let's shower together

95
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:37,241
I have already showered at work

96
00:09:37,414 --> 00:09:38,541
Stop messing around

97
00:09:40,152 --> 00:09:43,248
You'll ruin my clothes

98
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,426
Come on

99
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:50,458
That's really nice

100
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:56,270
See, my bra is soaking wet

101
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:01,377
Close your eyes

102
00:10:16,277 --> 00:10:18,075
Let's make love in bed

103
00:10:18,213 --> 00:10:20,512
I learned this from watching porno

104
00:10:20,684 --> 00:10:21,479
Shame on you

105
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:22,518
Let's try it

106
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:23,711
This way

107
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,380
Slowly

108
00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:46,614
That's cool

109
00:10:57,142 --> 00:10:58,634
We haven't made love for days

110
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:00,337
I can't control myself

111
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:01,540
Slowly, slowly

112
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,748
Let's change position, it's too wild

113
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:08,254
Don't move, don't move

114
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:20,712
I'm overwhelmed

115
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,680
So what?

116
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,484
He just touched you a little bit

117
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:16,562
What's happening?

118
00:13:16,598 --> 00:13:18,567
What have you got to lose?

119
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,864
He is one of my best customers

120
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:25,308
Where did he touch you?

121
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:27,280
Be smaft!

122
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:28,508
If he wants to feel your tits

123
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:30,016
Just give him your hands

124
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:31,277
And chat with him

125
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:34,018
Enough, stay out of this

126
00:13:34,394 --> 00:13:36,295
The trouble is not about being touched

127
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:39,399
What did he do to Xiao Mei?

128
00:13:40,003 --> 00:13:42,302
It's not about what a customer
could do to her

129
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,602
It's about what she did to the customer!

130
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,611
Look at this!

131
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:49,617
She sliced off his toe nail with this

132
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:51,810
The water turned crimson with blood

133
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:53,014
Served him right!

134
00:13:53,358 --> 00:13:53,846
You still have the nerve to talk

135
00:13:54,024 --> 00:13:56,017
Let Xiao Mei apologize to him

136
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:58,457
Tell him she is too young

137
00:13:58,865 --> 00:14:01,358
I don't need your advice

138
00:14:01,537 --> 00:14:02,869
You know what he said?

139
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,632
If I don't sack Xiao Mei

140
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,540
They will smash this whole place up

141
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,880
Just come in and be paid

142
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:10,949
Boss

143
00:14:11,753 --> 00:14:12,948
Stop talking

144
00:14:13,357 --> 00:14:16,657
I can't keep you here, go somewhere else

145
00:14:16,794 --> 00:14:18,957
For sure Xiao Mei wasn't intentional

146
00:14:19,065 --> 00:14:20,863
Shut up and go back to work

147
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:26,501
Xiao Mei

148
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:34,581
Shit, finished!

149
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,802
Beijing is so big

150
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:45,531
Beijing is this big...

151
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:48,403
How could there be no space for
a little me?

152
00:14:48,546 --> 00:14:49,410
How little?

153
00:14:49,547 --> 00:14:51,106
Just this little

154
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,547
Let me see!

155
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,566
Sister

156
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:07,938
They're all fucking jerks!

157
00:15:08,143 --> 00:15:10,044
Fucking "stupid fucks"

158
00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:12,139
You've only been in Beijing a
few months

159
00:15:12,451 --> 00:15:13,850
You've already learned to say
"stupid fucks"!

160
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:27,565
Are you alright?

161
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,676
Yeah, I'm fine

162
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:45,100
Sorry

163
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:46,727
Sorry

164
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:24,857
So the time forthe next poker
game is fixed

165
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:27,094
Bring more money with you then

166
00:16:40,892 --> 00:16:42,087
Get up

167
00:16:42,928 --> 00:16:45,592
People are coming

168
00:16:49,138 --> 00:16:51,130
Leave me alone

169
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,806
An Kun

170
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,811
We made love last night...

171
00:16:57,218 --> 00:16:58,618
What?

172
00:17:20,856 --> 00:17:22,084
Who are you?

173
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,056
Boss, what are you doing?

174
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:25,058
What are you doing?

175
00:17:25,263 --> 00:17:26,253
Boss!

176
00:17:30,371 --> 00:17:32,671
Boss, please stop it!

177
00:17:34,377 --> 00:17:36,175
I'm not doing this on purpose

178
00:17:37,215 --> 00:17:40,277
I don't want this please...

179
00:17:45,395 --> 00:17:46,384
Be quiet

180
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,390
I won't be hurting you

181
00:18:33,171 --> 00:18:33,866
Fuck

182
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:34,870
Fuck

183
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:38,974
Stupid bitch, motherfucker

184
00:18:39,115 --> 00:18:39,978
What the fuck are you staring at?

185
00:18:40,116 --> 00:18:41,084
You've never seen this before?

186
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:42,310
I fuck your whole family

187
00:18:42,486 --> 00:18:45,082
Don't fucking smash my window

188
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:51,995
You, what are you doing here?

189
00:19:09,062 --> 00:19:10,531
Get out of here!

190
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:20,140
L'll kill you!

191
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,145
I will kill you!

192
00:19:21,282 --> 00:19:22,544
Are you crazy?

193
00:19:22,852 --> 00:19:24,183
Get the security guards

194
00:19:24,353 --> 00:19:25,480
You screwed my wife

195
00:19:28,193 --> 00:19:29,285
l'll kill you!

196
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:31,356
Dare to fuck my wife

197
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:33,857
Get Liu Pingguo here

198
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,496
Get him out of here!

199
00:19:36,673 --> 00:19:38,369
Don't let him in again

200
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:42,209
I will report you!

201
00:20:03,617 --> 00:20:05,518
What are you doing?

202
00:20:10,727 --> 00:20:12,219
Stop bashing yourself!

203
00:20:12,564 --> 00:20:14,534
What are you doing to yourself?

204
00:20:18,942 --> 00:20:21,776
You fucking dirty bitch

205
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:25,082
Stupid bitch!

206
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:25,876
Go away

207
00:20:26,052 --> 00:20:26,883
I won't

208
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:34,865
We've already got enough trouble

209
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,060
Get out

210
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:39,698
Why do you want to kick me out?

211
00:20:41,177 --> 00:20:42,873
I won't go!

212
00:20:45,884 --> 00:20:47,285
I won't go!

213
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:03,101
Where is your underwear?

214
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,960
Did he fuck you like this?

215
00:21:36,398 --> 00:21:39,163
Did he fuck you like this?

216
00:21:40,706 --> 00:21:43,073
Did he fuck you like this?

217
00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:20,428
Mrs. Lin

218
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,257
Why don't you take your wife to my
beauty salon?

219
00:23:40,397 --> 00:23:41,955
You don't want to wait for the boss?

220
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:43,465
Is he up to any mischief lately?

221
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:44,193
You must be kidding

222
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,496
He is a fine gentleman

223
00:23:46,106 --> 00:23:48,302
If he is a gentleman, we are all saints!

224
00:23:48,476 --> 00:23:50,104
That's not the case

225
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:52,974
See you, Mrs. Lin

226
00:24:31,446 --> 00:24:32,538
Fuck!

227
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:34,547
Who the fuck did this?

228
00:25:05,432 --> 00:25:07,595
I have so much to worry about

229
00:25:08,137 --> 00:25:09,105
Yes

230
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:11,540
Alright

231
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,117
Hey, where is my hair clip?

232
00:25:22,026 --> 00:25:22,822
This one?

233
00:25:23,227 --> 00:25:25,219
Yeah, that's it

234
00:25:26,266 --> 00:25:27,564
My boyfriend bought it for me

235
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:35,436
Hello

236
00:25:38,552 --> 00:25:40,146
What are you talking about?

237
00:25:40,388 --> 00:25:42,051
There are more than 50 girls at my place

238
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:44,252
How would I know who is Liu Pingguo?

239
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:47,160
Whoever fucked your wife is a bastard

240
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:52,268
What? $20,000!

241
00:25:52,408 --> 00:25:55,311
$20,000? You're crazy, go rob a bank

242
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,674
You still owe me $200

243
00:25:56,814 --> 00:25:58,373
What the fuck is emotional distress?

244
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:00,085
Fuck you

245
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,216
I will break your leg, asshole

246
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,486
Go away

247
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,636
Did you say I owe you $200?

248
00:26:19,518 --> 00:26:21,510
I'm not that kind of guy

249
00:26:21,655 --> 00:26:25,319
Thanks, l'll serve you even better
next time

250
00:26:28,933 --> 00:26:33,373
Hello, I'm on my way

251
00:26:41,352 --> 00:26:42,650
Boss

252
00:26:46,894 --> 00:26:49,558
You didn't tell me that you're married

253
00:26:49,866 --> 00:26:52,166
Boss, I'd like to talk to you

254
00:26:52,872 --> 00:26:54,305
Asking for money again?

255
00:26:54,474 --> 00:26:55,668
You two make a perfect team

256
00:26:55,776 --> 00:26:57,176
No, it's not like that, Boss

257
00:26:57,312 --> 00:26:59,372
Let's talk in the car

258
00:27:00,784 --> 00:27:02,218
$2,000

259
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,719
That's the end of it

260
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,291
Understand?

261
00:27:07,394 --> 00:27:08,521
I didn't come for money

262
00:27:08,697 --> 00:27:10,893
I didn't know An Kun asked you
for money

263
00:27:12,603 --> 00:27:15,904
I don't care if you do or not

264
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,538
From now on

265
00:27:18,713 --> 00:27:20,807
I never want to see you again

266
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,846
Neither of you

267
00:27:25,022 --> 00:27:27,959
Boss, are you firing me?

268
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:33,561
You don't expect a promotion, do you?

269
00:27:34,538 --> 00:27:40,447
Actually, it was just an one-night stand

270
00:27:41,383 --> 00:27:44,751
Boss, but how could that be?

271
00:27:44,887 --> 00:27:45,946
I never wanted...

272
00:27:46,257 --> 00:27:48,453
It was you who started it

273
00:27:48,893 --> 00:27:51,888
You had an orgasm, right?

274
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,577
Get out of my car

275
00:28:01,715 --> 00:28:02,704
I got to go home

276
00:28:03,284 --> 00:28:04,012
Boss

277
00:28:08,825 --> 00:28:10,921
You can't put the blame on me!

278
00:28:11,296 --> 00:28:14,392
Really, if you want to fire me

279
00:28:14,501 --> 00:28:17,836
I will report you for rape

280
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:20,704
On what ground?

281
00:28:22,448 --> 00:28:24,940
The stuff that you left on my skirt

282
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,448
Who do you think I'm? Bill Clinton?

283
00:28:31,963 --> 00:28:34,432
An Kun doesn't know about it

284
00:28:35,636 --> 00:28:37,628
I will not tell anybody

285
00:28:39,442 --> 00:28:41,377
Boss

286
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,745
Is that alright?

287
00:29:06,484 --> 00:29:07,383
Does this hurt?

288
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,419
Not hurt

289
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:10,489
I'm telling you

290
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:12,992
You can lose more weight with
love-making

291
00:29:13,095 --> 00:29:14,097
People like us

292
00:29:14,097 --> 00:29:15,759
We don't get laid easily

293
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,996
We can only lay here cupping

294
00:29:18,103 --> 00:29:19,731
That's you not me

295
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:24,006
How do you manage your problem?

296
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,005
What problem?

297
00:29:26,818 --> 00:29:28,719
Infertility is not a problem!

298
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:30,619
I don't want a child anyway

299
00:29:30,924 --> 00:29:32,916
Mrs. Lin, someone's looking for you

300
00:29:33,562 --> 00:29:34,621
A man or a woman?

301
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:35,663
A man

302
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:45,948
Where are my cigarettes?

303
00:29:46,082 --> 00:29:48,551
I'm telling you the truth

304
00:30:01,106 --> 00:30:03,667
I'm telling you my true feeling

305
00:30:03,877 --> 00:30:06,506
I'm not surprised at what that
bastard did

306
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:07,984
It's not the first time

307
00:30:07,984 --> 00:30:11,683
Expecting a man to not fuck around is like
expecting a dog not to look for bones

308
00:30:13,893 --> 00:30:15,725
But asking me for money

309
00:30:15,896 --> 00:30:17,694
That's not very smart

310
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,592
l'll tell you why

311
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,136
Even if I have problems with my husband

312
00:30:21,305 --> 00:30:22,739
We are still a couple on the same side

313
00:30:22,908 --> 00:30:24,205
I won't do anything against my
self interest

314
00:30:24,844 --> 00:30:28,009
While we both feel cheated

315
00:30:28,616 --> 00:30:31,815
But if you're asking me for money
as a redemption

316
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,753
You are asking me to act against
my self interest

317
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,824
Do you understand, boy?

318
00:30:36,329 --> 00:30:38,959
If you don't pay, I will report him

319
00:30:40,168 --> 00:30:42,330
My husband screwed your wife, right?

320
00:30:42,572 --> 00:30:43,767
He did it against her will

321
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:46,340
Against her will, and you feel
bad about it?

322
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,944
Not only that, I am hurt and depressed

323
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:51,679
You are hurt?

324
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:56,787
If he denies it, you'll never
get your $20,000

325
00:30:56,963 --> 00:30:57,952
Right?

326
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,862
If he admits it, it would be easy

327
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,664
You are heading in the wrong direction

328
00:31:02,872 --> 00:31:06,810
No matter what, he won't give
you money

329
00:31:07,311 --> 00:31:09,304
He doesn't care much about money

330
00:31:09,682 --> 00:31:11,674
But he does care a lot more about face

331
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:14,721
He will lose face if he gives you money

332
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:19,729
Cutie, there is no way you can
get that money

333
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:24,000
You want to report him?

334
00:31:24,706 --> 00:31:27,141
It is a no-win situation for you, too

335
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,210
What evidence have you got?

336
00:31:29,314 --> 00:31:31,806
Who can tell what really happened?

337
00:31:31,918 --> 00:31:33,910
Isn't that obvious?

338
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:39,757
Unless you really love money

339
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:43,432
If you're not just in for the money

340
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:53,276
I can have other solutions for you

341
00:31:54,854 --> 00:31:55,947
Like what?

342
00:31:59,061 --> 00:32:01,257
My husband fucked your wife

343
00:32:01,364 --> 00:32:03,061
Why don't you fuck his wife?

344
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:11,813
That bastard

345
00:32:13,184 --> 00:32:14,311
That asshole

346
00:32:15,888 --> 00:32:17,880
What are you staring at?

347
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:25,996
It's French

348
00:33:26,134 --> 00:33:27,236
A gift from a customer

349
00:33:27,236 --> 00:33:28,225
Perfume?

350
00:33:28,404 --> 00:33:29,099
Perfume

351
00:33:30,107 --> 00:33:31,006
It's gorgeous

352
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:32,907
Anyway, it's free

353
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:33,910
Just eat

354
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:38,110
You know how stupid the jerk is?

355
00:33:38,253 --> 00:33:40,119
He not only sings like shit,
but filthy-minded as well

356
00:33:40,257 --> 00:33:43,819
I told him if he wants to touch me

357
00:33:43,962 --> 00:33:46,330
He has to buy me a cell phone

358
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:47,332
And he really bought me one

359
00:33:47,468 --> 00:33:49,232
You let him touched you?

360
00:33:49,438 --> 00:33:50,530
Only once

361
00:33:52,575 --> 00:33:54,237
Look, nice phone?

362
00:33:57,451 --> 00:34:00,046
That jerk is calling again

363
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:24,525
Let's take a picture

364
00:34:25,495 --> 00:34:26,394
Is the picture clear?

365
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27,896
Very clear

366
00:34:29,602 --> 00:34:31,298
As good as a proper camera?

367
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:32,099
An Kun

368
00:34:32,206 --> 00:34:33,442
We don't need him in the picture

369
00:34:33,442 --> 00:34:34,305
An Kun

370
00:34:35,712 --> 00:34:37,043
Get closer

371
00:34:37,214 --> 00:34:38,910
Get ready

372
00:34:39,151 --> 00:34:42,213
3, 2, 1

373
00:34:58,382 --> 00:35:00,248
Somebody is outside the window

374
00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:07,285
How could it be?

375
00:35:11,002 --> 00:35:13,472
Yeah, there's someone

376
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:20,578
The curtain is drawn,
how could you tell?

377
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:24,781
There's really someone

378
00:35:41,216 --> 00:35:43,412
There's no one

379
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:47,123
You fucked somebody's wife

380
00:35:50,164 --> 00:35:52,327
What are you talking about?

381
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:57,167
Her husband even saw your butt

382
00:35:58,444 --> 00:36:00,277
That jerk came to you?

383
00:36:04,187 --> 00:36:07,180
Don't listen to him

384
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:09,155
He's all bullshit

385
00:36:09,295 --> 00:36:11,265
I'm not talking to you anymore

386
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,746
Get me the candle

387
00:37:21,678 --> 00:37:23,270
Fuck

388
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,583
It's not mine

389
00:37:31,726 --> 00:37:33,695
For sure, it's not mine

390
00:37:34,832 --> 00:37:36,231
What if it's yours?

391
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:39,301
No way, we didn't have sex back then

392
00:37:39,907 --> 00:37:40,805
You don't remember anything, do you?

393
00:37:40,941 --> 00:37:42,432
Of course we did

394
00:37:42,711 --> 00:37:44,340
We did at that time

395
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:47,542
l'll drink your pee if it is mine

396
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:49,312
Go drink it!

397
00:37:50,657 --> 00:37:52,421
I don't want it anyway

398
00:37:52,527 --> 00:37:54,553
I will get an abortion tomorrow

399
00:37:55,265 --> 00:37:57,735
Fucking shit

400
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:00,227
What are you doing?

401
00:38:00,372 --> 00:38:02,467
Why are you talking like that?

402
00:38:02,643 --> 00:38:04,544
Stop talking about the past

403
00:38:06,048 --> 00:38:07,448
Don't do it

404
00:38:07,584 --> 00:38:08,949
It's none of your business

405
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:12,592
Since it is not yours, why keep it?

406
00:38:12,592 --> 00:38:14,963
If you dare to do it,
l'll break your leg

407
00:38:14,963 --> 00:38:17,455
I will do it tomorrow

408
00:38:19,002 --> 00:38:22,064
It's my belly, not yours

409
00:38:31,689 --> 00:38:33,682
Don't do that

410
00:38:33,826 --> 00:38:36,797
This is a chance from heaven

411
00:38:47,047 --> 00:38:48,606
How are you related to him?

412
00:38:48,717 --> 00:38:51,016
I'm his cousin

413
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,412
He says he's your cousin

414
00:38:54,927 --> 00:38:56,919
Are you his wife's cousin?

415
00:38:57,063 --> 00:38:57,620
Yeah

416
00:38:57,764 --> 00:38:59,130
You can go in

417
00:39:11,386 --> 00:39:13,788
No, no. I'm not here to fight

418
00:39:14,157 --> 00:39:15,351
I'm here to tell you something

419
00:39:15,493 --> 00:39:17,360
You dare to claim to be my cousin?

420
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:18,455
I was afraid you wouldn't let me in

421
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,156
Of course I don't want you to come in

422
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,563
Go away

423
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,566
I really have something to tell you

424
00:39:24,674 --> 00:39:26,768
You have a cold, is it serious?

425
00:39:27,913 --> 00:39:29,779
Liu Pingguo is pregnant

426
00:39:30,617 --> 00:39:31,880
Congratulations

427
00:39:32,186 --> 00:39:33,518
I should congratulate you

428
00:39:35,525 --> 00:39:38,792
Your wife is pregnant,
what's that to do with me?

429
00:39:39,398 --> 00:39:40,797
Let's calculate the dates

430
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,803
On September 20, you and Liu Pingguo...

431
00:39:43,905 --> 00:39:45,932
Today is October 23

432
00:39:46,608 --> 00:39:47,541
See, the dates match

433
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:48,906
What do you mean by that?

434
00:39:49,246 --> 00:39:51,808
I tell you, as long as I live

435
00:39:51,951 --> 00:39:53,920
You won't get a penny from me

436
00:39:54,221 --> 00:39:55,621
I'm just talking with you

437
00:39:55,757 --> 00:39:57,817
Look, this is caused by you

438
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,259
You should accept your responsibility

439
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,328
Now, she is pregnant

440
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,332
If you want to report me

441
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:04,562
Go ahead

442
00:40:05,874 --> 00:40:07,740
I just want to talk to you

443
00:40:07,844 --> 00:40:08,640
Get out

444
00:40:08,845 --> 00:40:09,938
I will call security

445
00:40:10,247 --> 00:40:11,647
Why are you so rude?

446
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,941
I will report you for sure

447
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,948
You just go ahead and file your case

448
00:40:59,826 --> 00:41:01,056
Why ask me to pick you up?

449
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:02,521
Where's your car?

450
00:41:02,664 --> 00:41:04,326
Flat tire

451
00:41:08,073 --> 00:41:10,338
Liu Pingguo is pregnant

452
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:25,958
You have to accept it

453
00:41:26,101 --> 00:41:28,366
I've already made my decision

454
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:32,969
My principle is that anything
with a 70% chance

455
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,004
Then it is worth trying

456
00:41:46,434 --> 00:41:48,403
We are a married couple

457
00:41:48,604 --> 00:41:51,039
This will never change

458
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:55,740
We can adopt this baby

459
00:41:56,919 --> 00:42:02,416
I can't change what you have
already decided

460
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:05,725
Sixteen years and it's always like this

461
00:42:05,832 --> 00:42:08,028
I can only accept it

462
00:42:11,641 --> 00:42:13,940
However, we must sign an agreement

463
00:42:14,179 --> 00:42:17,844
If during this process you do
anything to hurt me

464
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:18,749
For example...

465
00:42:18,853 --> 00:42:21,049
You start another affair with
Liu Pingguo

466
00:42:21,556 --> 00:42:23,753
Or to do something harmful to me

467
00:42:23,994 --> 00:42:26,464
All your assets will be mine

468
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:31,765
Wang Mei, when I think about this

469
00:42:31,873 --> 00:42:33,968
I think of us as a family

470
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,169
If you talk like that

471
00:42:35,479 --> 00:42:37,209
We are up against each other

472
00:42:38,986 --> 00:42:40,510
But I can't act like a lamb

473
00:42:40,688 --> 00:42:42,212
Waiting to be slaughtered by you

474
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:46,621
Alright

475
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,526
So if anything happened

476
00:42:50,703 --> 00:42:53,731
l'll split my assets fifty-fifty with you

477
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:56,841
You think I will fall for a country girl?

478
00:42:57,014 --> 00:42:58,107
Pull over

479
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,014
What? I can't stop here

480
00:43:02,155 --> 00:43:03,714
Pull over!

481
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:07,921
Wang Mei

482
00:43:09,734 --> 00:43:11,032
Wang Mei

483
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,055
Come on up here, let's talk

484
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,566
Up here!

485
00:43:38,113 --> 00:43:39,581
What's your blood type?

486
00:43:39,715 --> 00:43:40,910
Type "A"

487
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:44,780
I'm a "B"

488
00:43:46,726 --> 00:43:47,694
What about Liu Pingguo?

489
00:43:47,828 --> 00:43:48,887
She is an "O"

490
00:43:52,002 --> 00:43:52,991
Let's put it this way

491
00:43:54,605 --> 00:43:57,941
If this baby is born a "B"

492
00:43:58,112 --> 00:43:59,944
Then it's my child and l'll keep it

493
00:44:00,115 --> 00:44:01,947
l'll pay you $100,000

494
00:44:02,118 --> 00:44:04,145
If it's blood type "A"

495
00:44:04,856 --> 00:44:06,722
You will not lose everything

496
00:44:06,859 --> 00:44:08,623
Because you'll have your own child

497
00:44:08,761 --> 00:44:10,627
If it's blood type "O"

498
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,224
Then we'll have to undergo a DNA test

499
00:44:13,837 --> 00:44:14,633
What do you think about this deal?

500
00:44:14,738 --> 00:44:15,763
It's not right

501
00:44:16,774 --> 00:44:17,935
What's wrong with it?

502
00:44:18,077 --> 00:44:19,670
Tell me

503
00:44:20,348 --> 00:44:23,250
I don't think we can do it like this

504
00:44:23,752 --> 00:44:27,350
Earlier you denied you and my wife had...

505
00:44:27,691 --> 00:44:29,752
So you refused to pay me $20,000

506
00:44:29,896 --> 00:44:30,864
That is one issue

507
00:44:30,964 --> 00:44:32,158
Now you want this child

508
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:33,062
That's a different issue

509
00:44:33,201 --> 00:44:34,965
This is about two separate issues

510
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:37,700
Your logic is wrong

511
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:43,015
If you accept my deal,
there's only one issue

512
00:44:43,184 --> 00:44:44,117
Then it's only $100,000

513
00:44:44,286 --> 00:44:45,276
How can it be just one issue?

514
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,388
You didn't even want to pay me before

515
00:44:46,722 --> 00:44:48,919
Because you denied you and my
wife have ever...

516
00:44:49,093 --> 00:44:50,823
This is irrelevant

517
00:44:50,996 --> 00:44:52,020
It is relevant!

518
00:44:52,198 --> 00:44:54,998
Do you now admit you fucked my wife?

519
00:44:55,136 --> 00:44:57,002
Why bring this up again?

520
00:44:58,409 --> 00:44:59,842
There's no need to talk about this

521
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,105
This is the key to both issues

522
00:45:02,315 --> 00:45:04,911
Since you want your child

523
00:45:05,053 --> 00:45:07,420
You have therefore admitted
you fucked my wife

524
00:45:07,722 --> 00:45:10,318
So you must pay me $100,000 first

525
00:45:10,427 --> 00:45:12,829
No, $20,000 for compensation

526
00:45:13,031 --> 00:45:13,964
This is one issue

527
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:15,430
Now Liu Pingguo is pregnant

528
00:45:15,769 --> 00:45:16,758
You want that baby in her belly

529
00:45:16,937 --> 00:45:18,338
So you must pay me another $100,000

530
00:45:18,474 --> 00:45:19,236
That's the second issue

531
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:19,774
We are talking about two issues!

532
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,939
Right now, I can't tell you clearly

533
00:45:23,081 --> 00:45:24,379
But what I can tell you is

534
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:27,755
No matterwhat, there is only one deal

535
00:45:27,755 --> 00:45:28,848
$100,000 total

536
00:45:28,957 --> 00:45:30,949
It's not $100,000, but $120,000

537
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,188
This is something more than just money

538
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:35,994
If this is not about money,
what is it about?

539
00:45:39,072 --> 00:45:39,767
Fuck

540
00:45:41,076 --> 00:45:41,804
Fuck

541
00:45:53,229 --> 00:45:53,924
It didn't happen, right?

542
00:45:54,096 --> 00:45:54,893
She disappeared

543
00:45:57,803 --> 00:45:58,428
There's nobody down there

544
00:45:58,804 --> 00:45:59,396
Nobody

545
00:47:10,218 --> 00:47:14,419
"Painless Aboftion"

546
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:30,447
Don't move

547
00:47:30,652 --> 00:47:31,550
Just one moment, don't move

548
00:47:32,053 --> 00:47:33,545
If we don't take out the entire fetus

549
00:47:33,689 --> 00:47:35,682
You will have to do the abortion again

550
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,392
You'll have to come back

551
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,655
How could it be?

552
00:47:59,498 --> 00:48:01,399
What are you looking at?

553
00:48:25,238 --> 00:48:26,537
I did it

554
00:48:29,178 --> 00:48:30,339
I did the abortion

555
00:48:30,447 --> 00:48:32,177
Just finished

556
00:48:33,152 --> 00:48:35,053
Are you out of your mind?

557
00:48:35,289 --> 00:48:36,655
You are crazy

558
00:48:37,158 --> 00:48:39,059
You are so silly

559
00:48:39,395 --> 00:48:41,193
Believe it or not

560
00:49:06,105 --> 00:49:07,436
I have no appetite

561
00:49:19,627 --> 00:49:21,254
What are you doing?

562
00:49:30,143 --> 00:49:32,339
You are hurting me

563
00:49:52,378 --> 00:49:55,781
Wang Mei, please change seat
with An Kun

564
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:01,593
An Kun, like what we agreed
the other day

565
00:50:01,593 --> 00:50:07,432
Here is $20,000 to compensate
you for your distress

566
00:50:07,602 --> 00:50:11,233
And here is another $100,000

567
00:50:14,748 --> 00:50:19,518
You should visit my place for a facial

568
00:50:19,922 --> 00:50:21,915
No, thanks

569
00:50:23,261 --> 00:50:25,526
l'll stamp it first

570
00:50:41,357 --> 00:50:41,755
Okay

571
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:42,960
Two copies of the contract

572
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,698
We each keep a copy

573
00:50:46,698 --> 00:50:49,260
For a successful paftnership

574
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:51,906
From now on, Liu Pingguo becomes...

575
00:50:52,274 --> 00:50:52,968
our most precious thing needing
protection

576
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:55,869
You must treat her well

577
00:50:56,013 --> 00:50:58,677
Otherwise you will not see a penny

578
00:51:00,487 --> 00:51:01,920
It's time to make the first payment

579
00:51:02,824 --> 00:51:05,488
Here is $20,000, count it

580
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:09,895
Let's have a toast!

581
00:51:10,638 --> 00:51:14,508
We'll let bygones be bygones

582
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,045
We are good friends now

583
00:52:46,657 --> 00:52:49,058
5, 6, 7, 8, 1...

584
00:52:55,104 --> 00:52:58,098
Yeah, right, with a smile

585
00:52:58,576 --> 00:53:01,775
Always smile to our customers at work

586
00:53:09,627 --> 00:53:11,095
Right

587
00:53:15,803 --> 00:53:17,898
Harder, harder

588
00:53:21,113 --> 00:53:23,207
You don't need to dance

589
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:24,818
I'm fine

590
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:26,514
Go back and rest

591
00:53:26,921 --> 00:53:28,013
Go

592
00:53:28,724 --> 00:53:30,022
Keep up with the dancing

593
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,821
Dance harder, smile, smile

594
00:53:33,132 --> 00:53:37,264
Come on, don't look away, smile

595
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:38,970
Follow me

596
00:53:40,778 --> 00:53:41,767
Follow me

597
00:53:41,945 --> 00:53:42,537
Yes

598
00:54:10,091 --> 00:54:11,081
Okay...

599
00:54:11,593 --> 00:54:12,685
Dry up

600
00:54:14,597 --> 00:54:15,587
Get me my clothes

601
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,292
I'm freezing

602
00:54:24,214 --> 00:54:26,308
Pingguo, here you are...

603
00:54:27,152 --> 00:54:28,915
Wait

604
00:54:29,722 --> 00:54:30,654
Just a second

605
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:35,920
Who is that?

606
00:54:36,133 --> 00:54:37,031
It's me

607
00:54:37,835 --> 00:54:39,633
Your place is really hard to find

608
00:54:39,771 --> 00:54:41,967
How do you know where we live?

609
00:54:42,977 --> 00:54:44,035
Where is Pingguo?

610
00:54:44,146 --> 00:54:45,044
She's taking a shower

611
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:45,977
Pingguo

612
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,244
He is here

613
00:54:48,987 --> 00:54:50,249
Who's here?

614
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,350
Mr. Lin.

615
00:54:54,695 --> 00:54:56,186
Oh, you two took a shower together?

616
00:54:57,366 --> 00:54:58,767
That is not right!

617
00:54:58,868 --> 00:55:00,861
What's wrong with that?

618
00:55:02,675 --> 00:55:04,974
What if you could not control
yourself?

619
00:55:05,313 --> 00:55:08,112
We are married and we're not
having an affair

620
00:55:08,284 --> 00:55:12,086
Making love too often will
affect the baby

621
00:55:12,824 --> 00:55:14,918
Anyway, I said what I have to say

622
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:18,031
Before Liu Pingguo gives birth,

623
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,399
You'd better stop making love with her

624
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:26,103
Also look, your place is filthy

625
00:55:26,246 --> 00:55:28,044
You should clean up regularly

626
00:55:28,216 --> 00:55:31,415
Open the window to let in fresh air

627
00:55:32,255 --> 00:55:33,245
Let me open the window

628
00:55:33,424 --> 00:55:34,722
Do you snore?

629
00:55:34,859 --> 00:55:37,226
No, never

630
00:55:37,764 --> 00:55:38,424
You never snore?

631
00:55:38,765 --> 00:55:39,163
No

632
00:55:39,334 --> 00:55:40,267
What? You don't snore?

633
00:55:40,436 --> 00:55:41,733
You snore like a pig!

634
00:55:44,442 --> 00:55:45,933
I bought these pills for myself

635
00:55:46,044 --> 00:55:47,239
Now, I'm giving them to you

636
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,939
Take them twice a day

637
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:50,949
Two tablets at a time

638
00:55:51,052 --> 00:55:52,953
Make sure you take them before you sleep

639
00:55:53,055 --> 00:55:53,852
Remember?

640
00:55:53,957 --> 00:55:55,049
It's called "Quiet Nights"

641
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,451
Pingguo, come here

642
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,459
Here are some dietary supplements
for you

643
00:56:01,869 --> 00:56:02,859
I tried them

644
00:56:03,006 --> 00:56:04,268
They taste awful

645
00:56:04,374 --> 00:56:06,002
But you should take them anyway

646
00:56:06,176 --> 00:56:08,008
They are good for the baby

647
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:12,814
On which side of the bed do you sleep?

648
00:56:12,987 --> 00:56:13,818
On the right

649
00:56:13,989 --> 00:56:16,982
But you should start sleeping
on the left

650
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:17,992
Why?

651
00:56:18,129 --> 00:56:19,119
My parents told me

652
00:56:19,298 --> 00:56:21,199
Sleeping on the left will bring you a boy

653
00:56:21,401 --> 00:56:24,497
An Kun, you should sleep in here

654
00:56:32,952 --> 00:56:34,011
I'm leaving

655
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,350
Take it easy

656
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:41,257
I told you not to take this home

657
00:56:41,566 --> 00:56:43,535
When did I ever snore?

658
00:56:43,837 --> 00:56:44,428
That's bullshit

659
00:56:44,538 --> 00:56:46,370
I won't take this shit

660
00:56:47,076 --> 00:56:50,046
You snore loudly and you don't know

661
00:56:50,146 --> 00:56:52,172
Take them, they're very expensive

662
00:56:52,351 --> 00:56:53,147
Also very useful

663
00:56:53,251 --> 00:56:55,346
Eat, you have them

664
00:57:00,097 --> 00:57:01,564
What's wrong?

665
00:57:02,867 --> 00:57:04,971
What's your problem?

666
00:57:04,971 --> 00:57:06,370
You blow your top for nothing

667
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,202
Come on, let's put them on the shelf

668
00:57:08,376 --> 00:57:09,867
My belly is hurting

669
00:57:10,011 --> 00:57:10,910
Hurry up

670
00:57:24,301 --> 00:57:26,293
How come it only has six nails?

671
00:57:28,207 --> 00:57:30,301
It's over there

672
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:43,324
The child must be mine, right?

673
00:57:43,666 --> 00:57:47,536
It's a gamble, either you lose or win

674
00:57:48,139 --> 00:57:51,668
Willing to gamble and willing to lose

675
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:56,142
How do you know that I would lose?

676
00:58:51,574 --> 00:58:54,568
Can you stop making noises?

677
00:59:02,258 --> 00:59:05,821
He's kicking, that little thing

678
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:08,431
You kick when your dad is near

679
00:59:08,569 --> 00:59:09,331
You can hear the kicking?

680
00:59:09,469 --> 00:59:10,232
Yes, yes

681
00:59:10,371 --> 00:59:12,363
The baby is kicking less than before

682
00:59:12,641 --> 00:59:16,944
The baby just want to greet his dad

683
00:59:17,449 --> 00:59:19,885
Come on baby, kick one more time

684
00:59:21,288 --> 00:59:24,748
You really make your dad proud

685
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,421
How could you be so sure the
child is yours?

686
00:59:28,968 --> 00:59:30,561
It must be my child

687
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,500
Why don't you come over and try?

688
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,735
See if he kicks for you or not

689
00:59:37,682 --> 00:59:38,979
Keep the hammer away

690
00:59:43,858 --> 00:59:46,851
How is it, is he kicking?

691
00:59:47,731 --> 00:59:50,497
No kicking, right?

692
00:59:50,636 --> 00:59:51,625
You are so stupid!

693
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:54,867
Kicking proves nothing

694
00:59:55,377 --> 00:59:57,574
You'd better pray that the child's mine

695
00:59:58,582 --> 01:00:00,642
If you want to fix the chair, go outside

696
01:00:00,785 --> 01:00:03,654
The noise will frighten my baby

697
01:00:12,604 --> 01:00:14,631
He's kicking again, see

698
01:00:14,775 --> 01:00:17,768
He kicks as long as I'm near

699
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:21,809
Baby...

700
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,522
So salty, my throat hurting

701
01:00:28,663 --> 01:00:31,759
The eggplant you cooked was so salty

702
01:00:36,443 --> 01:00:38,912
The eggplant you cooked was so salty

703
01:00:39,381 --> 01:00:42,374
My throat hurts like hell

704
01:00:45,423 --> 01:00:47,790
If you let him hover around your
belly again

705
01:00:47,928 --> 01:00:49,589
I will hit you

706
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:02,106
What if this is your child?

707
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:18,007
I'm talking to you

708
01:05:06,141 --> 01:05:07,200
Push harder, harder

709
01:05:07,343 --> 01:05:08,173
Spread your legs!

710
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:09,403
Don't cross them

711
01:05:09,546 --> 01:05:11,105
Push, push

712
01:05:20,564 --> 01:05:23,796
Hold her legs up a bit

713
01:05:25,804 --> 01:05:27,364
Push

714
01:05:28,242 --> 01:05:29,939
Push a bit more, push

715
01:05:30,379 --> 01:05:32,144
It will be okay in a second

716
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:33,507
Okay

717
01:05:33,852 --> 01:05:34,545
Okay, here it is

718
01:05:36,055 --> 01:05:37,079
It's a boy

719
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:53,983
Comes home and closes door

720
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:55,448
My daughter stays on the Internet...

721
01:05:55,587 --> 01:05:56,144
Dr. Zhang

722
01:05:56,287 --> 01:05:58,484
Here's the birth certificate
with his blood type

723
01:06:00,261 --> 01:06:00,988
Thanks

724
01:06:02,497 --> 01:06:08,336
I read the news and it scared me...

725
01:06:47,702 --> 01:06:50,502
Dr. Zhang, there's something
wrong here

726
01:06:50,641 --> 01:06:53,578
I'm not blood type "A", I'm a "B"

727
01:06:53,713 --> 01:06:55,305
Your wife must be "A"

728
01:06:55,449 --> 01:06:57,509
No, she is type "O"

729
01:06:57,952 --> 01:06:59,716
Surely someone has made a mistake

730
01:07:00,056 --> 01:07:00,546
No, there's no mistake

731
01:07:00,691 --> 01:07:02,284
Maybe your wife has been seeing
someone else

732
01:07:02,427 --> 01:07:04,658
Dr. Zhang, you should not say that

733
01:07:06,066 --> 01:07:07,159
How could that be wrong?

734
01:07:07,301 --> 01:07:08,997
A hospital like this doesn't
make mistakes

735
01:07:12,476 --> 01:07:13,466
Dr. Zhang

736
01:07:15,246 --> 01:07:17,147
l'll tell you the truth

737
01:07:19,287 --> 01:07:21,119
My wife was indeed seeing someone else

738
01:07:21,256 --> 01:07:22,724
I thought we could get it over

739
01:07:23,059 --> 01:07:25,551
But it showed up here again

740
01:07:29,069 --> 01:07:32,164
You must decide for yourself

741
01:07:32,307 --> 01:07:36,644
I'd like you to change this to "B"

742
01:07:38,118 --> 01:07:39,176
It is not possible

743
01:07:39,319 --> 01:07:41,049
Do this as a favour to me

744
01:07:41,188 --> 01:07:43,180
Because of the wrong blood type

745
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:44,588
My wife might divorce me

746
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:45,557
But I don't want to leave her

747
01:07:45,696 --> 01:07:47,688
You should clarify it and decide

748
01:07:48,032 --> 01:07:50,628
I don't care about the child's
true identity

749
01:07:50,771 --> 01:07:52,501
Dr. Zhang, l'll treat him as my own

750
01:07:52,707 --> 01:07:55,200
My wife is very stubborn

751
01:07:55,345 --> 01:07:57,280
When I discovered her affair

752
01:07:57,415 --> 01:07:59,247
She want to suicide

753
01:07:59,384 --> 01:08:01,216
If she does that again

754
01:08:01,354 --> 01:08:02,481
Who will take care of this child?

755
01:08:02,623 --> 01:08:03,487
What will this family then?

756
01:08:03,624 --> 01:08:06,288
This is something very wrong

757
01:08:08,566 --> 01:08:12,265
How could I change your mind?

758
01:08:12,405 --> 01:08:13,839
$1,500?

759
01:08:14,642 --> 01:08:15,735
It's impossible

760
01:08:16,078 --> 01:08:17,102
I don't want to give you trouble

761
01:08:17,246 --> 01:08:17,644
$2,500?

762
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:19,305
Even $3,000 will not do

763
01:08:23,456 --> 01:08:24,191
What's that?

764
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,625
Don't confuse the others

765
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,126
Okay, okay...

766
01:09:46,756 --> 01:09:48,520
I thought a thief has broken
into my place

767
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:50,691
You treat my place like a cash machine

768
01:09:50,862 --> 01:09:52,387
Taking money whenever you want

769
01:09:52,532 --> 01:09:55,367
I don't have enough money for
you to take

770
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:58,664
The device you bought is imported?

771
01:09:58,809 --> 01:09:59,777
How much is it?

772
01:10:00,477 --> 01:10:03,472
Spend carefully when you have money

773
01:10:03,617 --> 01:10:06,679
What if one day we got nothing left

774
01:10:06,821 --> 01:10:07,618
All our money is gone

775
01:10:07,756 --> 01:10:08,621
The cars are gone

776
01:10:08,758 --> 01:10:09,725
The people are gone

777
01:10:09,859 --> 01:10:11,725
What do we do then?

778
01:10:13,799 --> 01:10:17,259
I've already paid for the child

779
01:10:17,405 --> 01:10:19,875
As per the agreement

780
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:21,535
Once Liu Pingguo leaves hospital

781
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:23,705
We take the child home

782
01:10:23,949 --> 01:10:25,781
She will nurse him for half a year

783
01:10:25,918 --> 01:10:28,980
Then she will be gone

784
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,989
Where are you going?

785
01:11:57,565 --> 01:11:59,694
What a cute baby!

786
01:11:59,835 --> 01:12:02,067
Big eyes just like his mom

787
01:12:02,206 --> 01:12:04,437
Here is a gift from us

788
01:12:04,576 --> 01:12:05,475
Thanks

789
01:12:05,611 --> 01:12:07,774
Such a gorgeous baby

790
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:11,553
His eyes look just like Lin Dong's

791
01:12:11,888 --> 01:12:13,185
Like his dad, huh?

792
01:12:14,459 --> 01:12:16,086
No, he looks more like his mom

793
01:12:16,796 --> 01:12:19,095
Normally sons take after their mom

794
01:12:21,871 --> 01:12:23,863
Have some cake, everyone

795
01:12:24,008 --> 01:12:25,032
Don't wake him up

796
01:12:25,176 --> 01:12:26,872
You all brought him gifts?

797
01:12:27,213 --> 01:12:28,806
Congratulations, Mr. Lin

798
01:12:29,617 --> 01:12:31,711
Wang Mei, take a sip too

799
01:12:31,987 --> 01:12:34,149
Congratulations

800
01:12:34,491 --> 01:12:35,685
Thank you!

801
01:12:35,826 --> 01:12:38,194
Congratulation for having a
son at your age

802
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,794
It's not easy for an old man

803
01:12:40,934 --> 01:12:42,061
Who's old?

804
01:12:42,203 --> 01:12:43,637
I'm old, I'm old

805
01:12:44,073 --> 01:12:46,168
Maybe you should also have a baby?

806
01:12:48,914 --> 01:12:52,819
Why we are like their servants?

807
01:12:55,024 --> 01:12:57,119
Today Wang Mei is the child's mother

808
01:12:57,262 --> 01:12:59,958
So we have to stay in the kitchen

809
01:13:00,099 --> 01:13:00,930
You are the problem

810
01:13:01,067 --> 01:13:01,828
They want me to nurse the baby

811
01:13:01,968 --> 01:13:03,027
You insist on coming with me

812
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:04,034
So irritating

813
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:05,139
What do you mean?

814
01:13:05,274 --> 01:13:05,934
You are not part of this house yet

815
01:13:06,075 --> 01:13:06,666
Already looking down on me...

816
01:13:06,809 --> 01:13:07,708
Is the salad ready?

817
01:13:07,845 --> 01:13:09,244
It's ready. Here, take it

818
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:18,252
I feels like I'm bursting

819
01:13:19,297 --> 01:13:21,323
My breasts are so full

820
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,567
Liu Pingguo, could you feed him?

821
01:13:24,705 --> 01:13:26,674
Give him to me, just the right time

822
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:46,071
You should move in tomorrow

823
01:13:46,272 --> 01:13:48,071
You don't have to bring anything

824
01:13:48,209 --> 01:13:51,077
I have clothes here that you can wear

825
01:13:52,048 --> 01:13:55,110
To others you are our nanny

826
01:13:55,954 --> 01:13:59,256
I'd ratherwear my own clothes

827
01:14:22,263 --> 01:14:23,993
Bodhisattva

828
01:14:24,266 --> 01:14:26,862
This is where I conceive my son

829
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:28,700
It's a blessed place

830
01:14:29,041 --> 01:14:32,445
May the Bodhisattva watch over me

831
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,281
All my desires will realize

832
01:14:34,683 --> 01:14:36,311
My business prospers

833
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,313
And my family lives in peace

834
01:14:49,941 --> 01:14:50,805
Good morning

835
01:14:50,942 --> 01:14:52,012
Why do you cook yourself?

836
01:14:52,012 --> 01:14:54,709
I didn't wake you up since
you were tired

837
01:14:54,848 --> 01:14:56,910
Wake me, it doesn't matter

838
01:14:57,019 --> 01:15:00,047
Pingguo, help me to set the table

839
01:15:00,157 --> 01:15:01,125
Can you manage on your own?

840
01:15:01,259 --> 01:15:02,191
Sure

841
01:15:02,327 --> 01:15:04,262
Just set the table for two

842
01:15:04,398 --> 01:15:05,388
What about Mrs. Lin?

843
01:15:05,733 --> 01:15:07,827
She went to the bank this morning

844
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:09,802
She didn't have breakfast?

845
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:22,214
Le Le

846
01:15:24,463 --> 01:15:25,862
Le Le

847
01:15:26,098 --> 01:15:28,933
What's wrong baby?

848
01:15:29,271 --> 01:15:31,172
What's wrong? Missing your mama?

849
01:15:32,076 --> 01:15:33,475
Want some milk?

850
01:15:34,112 --> 01:15:35,170
Okay, Okay

851
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,049
You've not gone to work for days

852
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:22,953
What? The same with you, right?

853
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:25,586
I can run my business by phone

854
01:16:25,927 --> 01:16:27,021
It's the same

855
01:16:50,133 --> 01:16:52,626
You are not staying just for
the baby, are you?

856
01:17:35,072 --> 01:17:38,009
You still have not deposited the money?

857
01:17:38,143 --> 01:17:39,975
The money is from trading my
wife and child

858
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:42,106
I want to look at them every day

859
01:17:42,284 --> 01:17:44,651
I sleep with them every night

860
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:56,130
Look at this

861
01:18:14,502 --> 01:18:16,403
Stop fooling around

862
01:18:16,471 --> 01:18:19,465
Never seen so much stupid money
in your life?

863
01:18:27,522 --> 01:18:29,516
Bitch

864
01:18:48,757 --> 01:18:53,663
I can see why you are the best
at Golden Basin

865
01:18:53,765 --> 01:18:56,360
They were telling the truth, right?

866
01:18:59,474 --> 01:19:04,176
You think if you make a man comfortable

867
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:07,410
He will fall for you then?

868
01:19:10,224 --> 01:19:14,789
You are better than me on this

869
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:20,501
But I'm smarter than you

870
01:19:21,943 --> 01:19:27,407
I know you may trick Lin Dong

871
01:19:27,852 --> 01:19:31,222
But he does not dare to be
tricked by you

872
01:19:32,727 --> 01:19:34,958
Because he is a man

873
01:19:35,632 --> 01:19:41,836
He knows how to distinguish self
interest and love

874
01:19:43,343 --> 01:19:47,476
Mrs. Lin, you're thinking too much

875
01:19:48,853 --> 01:19:52,484
I'm not thinking too much,
I just care a lot

876
01:19:53,661 --> 01:19:56,563
A careful driver drives for ever

877
01:19:57,667 --> 01:19:59,762
You are a woman too

878
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:03,273
You need to keep a way out for yourself

879
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:07,609
Otherwise you will end up with nothing

880
01:20:08,284 --> 01:20:10,913
On life's gaming table

881
01:20:11,289 --> 01:20:15,591
Your stake is much greater than mine

882
01:20:19,401 --> 01:20:21,393
It's done, Mrs. Lin

883
01:21:17,796 --> 01:21:18,694
Call me dad

884
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:20,020
Call me dad

885
01:21:26,409 --> 01:21:28,401
Come on, put him down

886
01:21:29,146 --> 01:21:31,048
Let daddy give you a hug

887
01:21:33,653 --> 01:21:35,953
Let me wipe that off

888
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:46,730
Oh, your clothes are all wet

889
01:21:50,748 --> 01:21:51,977
That's alright

890
01:21:55,455 --> 01:21:58,152
Here's my clean baby

891
01:22:02,066 --> 01:22:06,563
He smells so good

892
01:22:07,207 --> 01:22:11,010
Pretty and clean

893
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:11,806
Alright

894
01:22:11,982 --> 01:22:13,472
Stop spinning, you'll make him dizzy

895
01:22:13,618 --> 01:22:14,677
Let me take him

896
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:15,582
Okay

897
01:22:16,623 --> 01:22:17,681
Are you dizzy?

898
01:22:17,824 --> 01:22:18,085
Let mama take you

899
01:22:18,224 --> 01:22:20,217
Sorry baby, here is your mom

900
01:22:22,198 --> 01:22:23,996
He's confused

901
01:22:24,135 --> 01:22:25,102
Sit down

902
01:22:27,206 --> 01:22:28,196
Le Le

903
01:22:28,842 --> 01:22:30,037
You've been here the whole day already

904
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:31,804
You still don't want to go home?

905
01:22:32,715 --> 01:22:33,647
You're watching me here

906
01:22:33,817 --> 01:22:35,513
Instead of going to work?

907
01:22:36,721 --> 01:22:37,915
No, it's not like that

908
01:22:38,223 --> 01:22:40,216
Recently I have not been working at all

909
01:22:44,567 --> 01:22:47,663
Just a few months apart
and you can't stand it?

910
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,968
I want Pingguo to come home
for a few days

911
01:22:50,143 --> 01:22:51,941
That's not possible

912
01:22:52,146 --> 01:22:54,047
You have to keep your bargain

913
01:22:55,685 --> 01:22:56,778
Why don't you just leave?

914
01:22:56,954 --> 01:22:59,186
I'm already like an extra here

915
01:22:59,558 --> 01:23:00,252
Not even you

916
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:02,790
What are you talking about?

917
01:23:11,677 --> 01:23:13,167
Think about the money you got

918
01:23:13,312 --> 01:23:16,284
Don't be angry, it won't do you any good

919
01:23:16,619 --> 01:23:18,884
As I told you the first time we met

920
01:23:19,022 --> 01:23:22,687
Every problem has a different solution

921
01:23:22,896 --> 01:23:24,990
Lin Dong signed an agreement with me

922
01:23:25,232 --> 01:23:27,098
If he starts an affair with
Liu Pingguo again

923
01:23:27,235 --> 01:23:28,328
And breaks up with me

924
01:23:29,105 --> 01:23:31,301
His asset will be split fifty-fifty

925
01:23:32,243 --> 01:23:33,802
So I tell you, as long as I'm there

926
01:23:33,946 --> 01:23:35,812
He does not dare to do that

927
01:23:36,016 --> 01:23:38,145
Your wife will go back to you soon

928
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:40,652
You can never control him

929
01:23:40,823 --> 01:23:42,655
An Kun

930
01:23:44,931 --> 01:23:45,830
An Kun

931
01:23:45,933 --> 01:23:47,663
It's me, Xiao Mei

932
01:23:47,835 --> 01:23:49,633
Such a nice car

933
01:23:49,772 --> 01:23:51,137
My throat is sore

934
01:23:51,273 --> 01:23:52,241
Don't you remember me?

935
01:24:02,358 --> 01:24:04,156
Delicious?

936
01:25:10,167 --> 01:25:11,999
I miss my mom

937
01:27:28,087 --> 01:27:30,181
What did Wang Mei tell you?

938
01:27:31,694 --> 01:27:33,093
Tell me what she told you?

939
01:27:33,195 --> 01:27:34,492
I've already explained everything to you

940
01:27:34,631 --> 01:27:36,224
It was just a misunderstanding

941
01:27:36,435 --> 01:27:37,732
Nothing happened

942
01:27:39,104 --> 01:27:41,096
That child is mine

943
01:27:42,043 --> 01:27:45,140
I changed the blood type behind
your back

944
01:27:45,648 --> 01:27:46,741
You're just making this up

945
01:27:47,118 --> 01:27:48,346
You are really good at it

946
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:49,353
You are just jealous

947
01:27:49,522 --> 01:27:51,013
I already told you nothing
has happened

948
01:27:51,158 --> 01:27:51,625
Just think what you like

949
01:27:51,759 --> 01:27:52,554
Believe it or not

950
01:27:52,727 --> 01:27:53,717
You are so stupid

951
01:27:54,063 --> 01:27:55,121
Why should I fool you with that?

952
01:27:55,264 --> 01:27:57,233
That child is mine, you heard that?

953
01:27:57,335 --> 01:27:58,428
That child is mine

954
01:27:58,537 --> 01:27:59,435
Let's go to the hospital tomorrow

955
01:27:59,538 --> 01:28:00,673
To do a blood test

956
01:28:00,673 --> 01:28:02,232
Then we take a chance

957
01:28:02,343 --> 01:28:04,437
Bring the child back to our hometown

958
01:28:04,546 --> 01:28:06,174
Don't you feel ashamed?

959
01:28:06,349 --> 01:28:07,146
Is the child yours?

960
01:28:07,284 --> 01:28:09,480
You have no shame! You made us
look awful

961
01:28:09,654 --> 01:28:12,055
Fucking Liu Pingguo, you've changed

962
01:28:12,157 --> 01:28:13,455
You are just like a hooker

963
01:28:13,594 --> 01:28:15,061
You are just a fucking hooker

964
01:28:15,162 --> 01:28:16,152
You fucking...

965
01:28:18,201 --> 01:28:19,191
Stupid bitch

966
01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:21,061
Just get lost

967
01:28:22,308 --> 01:28:23,071
Get lost

968
01:28:25,579 --> 01:28:26,205
Get lost

969
01:28:28,183 --> 01:28:30,277
Fucking get lost

970
01:29:49,647 --> 01:29:53,211
Pingguo, what's wrong?

971
01:29:53,654 --> 01:29:55,316
What's wrong with you?

972
01:30:02,234 --> 01:30:03,536
Tell me what happened

973
01:30:03,536 --> 01:30:04,526
Why do you stop me?

974
01:30:05,338 --> 01:30:06,671
I gave it to you and you don't want it?

975
01:30:06,842 --> 01:30:08,538
Don't you like me?

976
01:30:09,746 --> 01:30:11,942
What happened?

977
01:30:37,490 --> 01:30:39,288
It's okay

978
01:30:39,594 --> 01:30:41,392
It's alright

979
01:32:52,106 --> 01:32:52,903
An Kun

980
01:32:54,009 --> 01:32:55,500
What are you doing?

981
01:32:56,747 --> 01:32:58,044
Why are you taking the child away?

982
01:33:33,906 --> 01:33:36,706
Did you two conspire against me?

983
01:33:37,579 --> 01:33:42,280
To kidnap the child and blackmail me

984
01:33:47,094 --> 01:33:50,930
Are you that crazy for money?

985
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:00,307
Did you devise the plot?

986
01:34:04,822 --> 01:34:06,723
There is nothing between her and me

987
01:34:06,859 --> 01:34:09,728
We even signed an agreement

988
01:34:13,135 --> 01:34:16,630
Did you drive An Kun to take
the child away?

989
01:34:16,841 --> 01:34:21,076
Without the child, we can't keep
Pingguo, right?

990
01:34:21,783 --> 01:34:23,046
I tell you

991
01:34:23,252 --> 01:34:25,244
If I find out you masterminded this

992
01:34:25,790 --> 01:34:26,779
l'll keep Pingguo here

993
01:34:26,958 --> 01:34:28,859
l'll marry her and divorce you

994
01:34:35,304 --> 01:34:37,068
Fuck

995
01:34:39,211 --> 01:34:42,204
After all these,
whom can I still trust?

996
01:34:42,883 --> 01:34:45,375
Everyone is cheating on me

997
01:34:46,189 --> 01:34:48,124
Fucking dirty games

998
01:35:13,766 --> 01:35:15,166
Officer Wang?

999
01:35:16,771 --> 01:35:19,037
My child has been kidnapped

1000
01:35:20,243 --> 01:35:21,836
Yes

1001
01:35:22,947 --> 01:35:24,346
I don't know

1002
01:35:25,886 --> 01:35:26,944
Okay

1003
01:36:02,210 --> 01:36:03,803
Stop running

1004
01:37:25,277 --> 01:37:27,075
Take it easy, buddy

1005
01:37:27,747 --> 01:37:29,147
Watch your step

1006
01:37:32,888 --> 01:37:34,083
Renovating?

1007
01:37:34,258 --> 01:37:35,783
It's a bit messy

1008
01:37:40,868 --> 01:37:42,199
Mr. Lin, you have visitors

1009
01:37:42,371 --> 01:37:43,804
Please come in

1010
01:37:45,175 --> 01:37:47,167
Oh, officer Wang

1011
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:50,976
I'm sorry, we are renovating

1012
01:37:51,118 --> 01:37:52,017
Even no room for a step

1013
01:37:52,386 --> 01:37:54,379
I don't know how to thank you this time

1014
01:37:54,723 --> 01:37:57,888
Karaoke or seafood? Your choice!

1015
01:37:57,995 --> 01:37:59,019
No need to thank me for now

1016
01:37:59,196 --> 01:38:01,325
Something unexpected happened

1017
01:38:01,701 --> 01:38:02,794
What happened?

1018
01:38:03,204 --> 01:38:05,035
Is that kid telling tall tales again?

1019
01:38:05,707 --> 01:38:07,904
He did not tell any new story

1020
01:38:08,312 --> 01:38:10,747
But we performed a DNA test with
your agreement

1021
01:38:11,350 --> 01:38:13,012
The results came out

1022
01:38:13,353 --> 01:38:15,823
I brought them for you

1023
01:38:16,925 --> 01:38:18,917
The analytical report shows

1024
01:38:19,228 --> 01:38:25,468
F9612 is not the biological
father of C9612

1025
01:38:25,839 --> 01:38:30,746
His biological father is in fact M9612

1026
01:38:30,881 --> 01:38:34,785
You are not related to C9612

1027
01:38:34,954 --> 01:38:41,761
An Kun is the biological father
of the child

1028
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:44,294
You take the report and read
it carefully

1029
01:38:49,511 --> 01:38:50,877
There must be a mistake

1030
01:38:52,382 --> 01:38:53,372
It can't be a mistake

1031
01:38:53,485 --> 01:38:54,782
It's not right

1032
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:56,782
What a test

1033
01:38:57,491 --> 01:38:59,118
Anything can be wrong

1034
01:38:59,394 --> 01:39:00,327
Don't get upset

1035
01:39:00,496 --> 01:39:03,330
How could you tear it up?

1036
01:39:04,135 --> 01:39:06,434
This is science and science
can't be wrong

1037
01:39:10,411 --> 01:39:11,812
Well, l'll see you later

1038
01:39:11,947 --> 01:39:14,416
You'd better accept the reality
of this matter

1039
01:39:14,851 --> 01:39:17,321
I don't know what went on
between you two

1040
01:39:17,423 --> 01:39:19,415
There is nothing

1041
01:39:20,026 --> 01:39:21,015
Okay, see you soon

1042
01:39:22,330 --> 01:39:23,319
Bye

1043
01:39:28,273 --> 01:39:29,263
Wrong

1044
01:39:31,178 --> 01:39:32,942
Absolute nonsense

1045
01:41:09,101 --> 01:41:11,230
This is my new address

1046
01:41:12,506 --> 01:41:14,600
I know you will not come to see me

1047
01:41:16,212 --> 01:41:18,408
But I still hope that you will
come one day

1048
01:42:24,322 --> 01:42:25,550
Hello

1049
01:42:57,776 --> 01:42:59,300
Is this Xiao Mei?

1050
01:43:19,510 --> 01:43:21,308
How did she die?

1051
01:43:22,915 --> 01:43:26,853
We suspect a customer robbed
and killed her

1052
01:43:53,296 --> 01:43:54,993
Count the money

1053
01:44:00,508 --> 01:44:02,875
I'm related to this child

1054
01:44:04,381 --> 01:44:05,872
Please keep the money

1055
01:44:06,318 --> 01:44:09,379
I feel he's my son the whole time

1056
01:44:09,489 --> 01:44:11,287
But he's not

1057
01:44:12,527 --> 01:44:15,327
Take the money back,
let me keep the child

1058
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:16,295
He's mine

1059
01:44:16,401 --> 01:44:18,393
We belong to each other

1060
01:44:18,704 --> 01:44:19,797
I can give you more money

1061
01:44:19,939 --> 01:44:20,929
Just tell me how much

1062
01:44:21,309 --> 01:44:23,835
He's my son, I will take him
with me today

1063
01:44:30,758 --> 01:44:32,522
For the sake of what we've gone
through together

1064
01:44:32,627 --> 01:44:33,719
Let me take the child

1065
01:44:38,436 --> 01:44:39,734
I give you three days

1066
01:44:39,871 --> 01:44:41,864
Otherwise we'll meet in court

1067
01:50:47,094 --> 01:50:56,090
THE END
