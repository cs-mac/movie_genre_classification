<i>MORDECAI: From whence comes
the purpose of a person's life?</i>

2
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,820
<i>Come it by chance, a casting of the lot,</i>

3
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,700
<i>or does a call of destiny
beckon to each of us?</i>

4
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,140
<i>Many have wondered
about my little Hadassah</i>

5
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,260
<i>and why a simple Jewish orphan</i>

6
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,500
<i>was chosen to stand against
the annihilation of her people.</i>

7
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,020
<i>And yet the mystery of the girl
most know as Esther</i>

8
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,060
<i>begins not where one might think,</i>

9
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,940
<i>but 500 years earlier</i>

10
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,020
<i>with a single act of disobedience.</i>

11
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,500
<i>King Saul of the Israelites</i>

12
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,860
<i>had been sent by the Prophet Samuel</i>

13
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,100
<i>to wipe out
an ancient child-sacrificing enemy.</i>

14
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,620
<i>So pervasive was their evil</i>

15
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,980
<i>that not even their oxen nor sheep
were to be spared,</i>

16
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,340
<i>and above all, no survivors left breathing.</i>

17
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,180
My lord, I give you Agag,
king of the Amalekites.

18
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,900
We have also seized for you his livestock.

19
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,340
Even his queen.

20
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,580
What dark portent bid me haste
to cross this land of ours?

21
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,740
How would you accuse me now,
O Prophet?

22
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,420
I carried out your lord's command.

23
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,540
Then why do my ears

24
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,340
ring with the lowing of oxen
and the bleating of sheep?

25
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,260
Your Majesty, the Amalekite queen,

26
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,020
she escaped.

27
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,660
We have the king.

28
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,620
What is one woman?

29
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,380
You fool,

30
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,820
she is with child.

31
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,540
<i>MORDECAI: While the Prophet Samuel
put a swift end to King Agag,</i>

32
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,260
<i>Agag's queen,</i>

33
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,340
<i>fleeing with the seed of vengeance
growing within her,</i>

34
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,060
<i>the Jews never found.</i>

35
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,380
HADASSAH: Uncle Mordecai!

36
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,380
Rebecca, what kind of housekeeper
do you think you are?

37
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,340
Serves you right
for bringing home your work.

38
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,420
HADASSAH:
The caravan arrived this morning.

39
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,220
Well, Susa is the capital of the new world.

40
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,940
Caravans arrive every day.

41
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,580
Not from Jerusalem.

42
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,660
Well, perhaps
you ought to go back and ask them

43
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,140
if they'll arrive the same time next year.

44
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,900
Next year? You promised.

45
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,780
- Rebecca!
- REBECCA: Fight your own battles.

46
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,620
You don't pay me enough
to fight the battle for you.

47
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,540
- Good morning, Hadassah.
- And where have you been?

48
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,060
I'm sorry, Grandmother,
the markets were really busy.

49
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,500
There's a new caravan in from...

50
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,060
- Sore subject.
- Uncle Mordecai,

51
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,780
does not your own heart
long to see our people restored to glory?

52
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,020
It does.

53
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,180
Did not Cyrus the Great conquer Babylon
and free our people from captivity?

54
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,620
He did.

55
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,900
But do we embrace our freedom
and leave this pagan empire

56
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,780
to embrace our destiny?

57
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,700
- Of course not.
- MORDECAI: Lord,

58
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,460
I pray to you day and night

59
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,220
to give me the patience of Job,

60
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,980
give me the wisdom of Solomon.

61
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,940
And what do you give me?

62
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,340
You give me the endless equivocations

63
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,300
of a beautiful, young woman.

64
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,540
Look.

65
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,140
Hadassah, always dreaming.

66
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,380
Maybe...

67
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,820
Here, then, you be the princess.

68
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,500
<i>While many Jews had forgotten
the acts of centuries past,</i>

69
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,620
<i>the descendants of Agag had not.</i>

70
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,340
<i>For Agag's queen did indeed survive</i>

71
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,140
<i>and gave birth to a son.</i>

72
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,500
<i>And she forged for him a mark,</i>

73
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,420
<i>prophesying that one day
an Agagite would arrive,</i>

74
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,300
<i>a descendant of Agag,</i>

75
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,220
<i>who would finally exact vengeance
upon the Jews.</i>

76
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,980
Hadassah, read us a story!
Read us a story!

77
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,700
A story? You want a story?

78
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,540
- GIRL: Hadassah, help!
- Over here.

79
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,620
Are you okay?

80
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,180
HADASSAH: "And King Saul said to David,

81
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,940
"'You cannot go before this Goliath

82
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,660
"'for you are but a youth.'

83
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,940
"David replied,

84
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,740
"'While keeping my father's sheep,
there came a lion and a bear.

85
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,260
"'And I slew them both.

86
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,380
"'This Goliath shall be as one of them
for he defied the armies of the Lord."'

87
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,860
As will Jesse Ben-Joseph,

88
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,300
should he but take one step closer.

89
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,500
With peace, Haman.

90
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,260
- There's little but random news I bear.
- I judge that.

91
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,860
Rumor has it

92
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,700
Queen Vashti plans not to attend
the King's banquet this evening,

93
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,820
in protest of the war.

94
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,260
Apparently the King has no idea.

95
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,140
Some see random news.
Others, opportunities.

96
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,860
Of course,
this is why you are a dispatch rider,

97
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,260
and I am a prince of the Fars.

98
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,900
Tell me, Agagite, what do you do with
the extra darics you connive from me?

99
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,100
I have 10 sons, my lord,

100
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,500
and a wife that makes many demands.

101
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,700
(CHUCKLES)

102
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,740
Ten sons?

103
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,420
You serve the great king well.

104
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,420
Come, come. Go you now.

105
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,380
Speak of me
as you lavish your wife and sons.

106
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,580
<i>ABIHAIL: Happy birthday, Hadassah!</i>

107
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,980
HADASSAH: A stone ball?

108
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,860
Remember, Hadassah,
it is the glory of God

109
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,460
to conceal a matter,

110
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,580
the honor of kings to seek it out.

111
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,580
It's from the Promised Land.

112
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,540
Your great-grandmother
brought it with her.

113
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,300
And like you, its true treasure

114
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,020
is etched within.

115
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,460
<i>PRIEST: Reconsider my proposition.</i>

116
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,140
There is much need for leadership
in Jerusalem.

117
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,300
More stew, my lord?

118
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,020
I don't suppose that in your entire caravan

119
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,340
you have a cook one half as good

120
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,020
as our Rebecca.

121
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,740
Here you are but a poor palace scribe,

122
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,340
one who passes as a Persian, at that.

123
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,580
Are you a Jew?
Or have you become a Gentile?

124
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,580
We're a small people

125
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,500
caught up in a vast and violent empire.

126
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,060
We have capricious princes

127
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,860
who could order our annihilation
with the flick of a finger.

128
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,620
And your presence in the palace
might prevent it?

129
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,340
Probably not.

130
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,540
Look, tell me what I want to hear about.
Tell me about the Temple.

131
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,780
What ecstasy to stand in the presence
of the Almighty!

132
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,100
Like the intimate embrace
of a husband and wife.

133
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,460
It's so much deeper
than mere mortal love.

134
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,060
Oh, hello.

135
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,780
<i>MORDECAI: Now, it came to pass
in the days of King Xerxes,</i>

136
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,420
<i>who ruled over the empire
of the Medes and Persians,</i>

137
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,780
<i>from Ethiopia to India,</i>

138
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,900
<i>that in the third year of his reign,</i>

139
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,980
<i>he decreed a season of feasting.</i>

140
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,860
<i>Rumors of war were in the wind, however,</i>

141
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,380
<i>and some thought this the King's way
of stalling off a much-debated decision</i>

142
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,340
<i>to march on Greece
in retaliation for his father's death</i>

143
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,100
<i>four years before.</i>

144
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,980
MAN: Queen Vashti, Your Majesty.

145
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,380
Enter.

146
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,780
The night's festivities
hold not your interest, dear?

147
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,980
It is long since you summoned me here.

148
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,340
- Your hands have not been idle.
- Not idle,

149
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,980
not gifted either.

150
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,500
MORDECAI: Later, Hadassah,
we'll discuss this later.

151
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,300
I have run out of laters.

152
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,580
The caravan leaves tomorrow.

153
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,660
Did not the priest even say
it would be good for me?

154
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,500
That he would look after me?

155
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,940
You have so much of your
mother and father in you, you know?

156
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,660
And perhaps
I'm just being a very selfish old man.

157
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,340
Do you really want to go to Jerusalem?

158
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,380
Truly.

159
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,820
Then go with my blessing.

160
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,460
Thank you.

161
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,900
Rebecca!

162
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,420
Yes, well,
I will be late coming back tonight.

163
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,060
The feasting has been extended.

164
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,980
All Susa is invited.

165
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,580
All of Susa?

166
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,220
A drunken brawl is no place
for a young lady of purity.

167
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,820
Then why is a good Jew like you going?

168
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,940
All the scribes have to go!
There is war in the air!

169
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,180
(ALL CHATTERING)

170
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,260
The Queen indeed
holds her own feast in protest.

171
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,340
All is prepared as you have asked.

172
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,660
You do know why the princes have asked
you to extend the feast another night.

173
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,140
You are too late
if you seek me to deny them.

174
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,540
Especially now.

175
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,460
Such clamoring to march upon Greece
and avenge my father's death.

176
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,340
How long have you dreamt
of molding Persia

177
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,860
into a pillar of learning and culture?

178
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,660
A flame to make even
the greatness of Greece but a shadow?

179
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,340
You know as well as I,

180
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,460
this is not something that is won in battle

181
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,140
but in the hearts of men.

182
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,380
You would have me do nothing, then?

183
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,620
You're no warrior,

184
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,340
no soldier.

185
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,900
I'd have you stay,

186
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,860
enhance your kingdom,

187
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,380
preserve your throne.

188
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,180
Looking for someone?

189
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,260
I'm fine, thank you.

190
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,860
You can run back to Rebecca now.

191
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,340
Oh, I'm sure you're fine.

192
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,060
Only tell me, Hadassah,

193
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,620
or whoever you are,

194
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,460
how do you intend to get into the palace?

195
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,740
You didn't come to take me back?

196
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,380
Come, or I shall call you
Hadassah the mouse.

197
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,780
Wait!

198
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,420
I appear to you by the gracious command

199
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,340
of the great king of kings,

200
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:50,460
the emperor of the world, Xerxes,
son of Darius.

201
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,980
Great king.

202
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,140
(ALL CHEERING)

203
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,540
We drink.

204
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,060
We drink also to my guard,
the immortal 10,000,

205
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,540
but I fear I would soon have to send them
out to conquer new vineyards for me.

206
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,140
(ALL LAUGHING)

207
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,220
Then let us drink to Queen Vashti,
the most beautiful in the land.

208
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,140
Bring forth Vashti!

209
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,500
Vashti!

210
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,820
(ALL CHANTING)

211
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,700
Bring forth Vashti!

212
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,780
They are serious? They demand
Vashti be here before all?

213
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,260
Already rumors circulate

214
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,500
as to why the Queen holds her own feast

215
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,020
instead of attending yours.

216
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,700
They sound riotous, my lord.

217
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,740
They fear a divided kingdom.

218
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,460
My lord,
you know the Queen's position on the war.

219
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,460
Send for her.

220
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,700
They go to fetch the Queen.
She must be lovely,

221
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,900
reigning in a place such as this.

222
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,460
None is more lovely than you, my queen.

223
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,180
- My thanks, fair prince.
- Prince?

224
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,860
Why is it for years you threatened
to join the caravans to Jerusalem,

225
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,380
yet you never do?

226
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,020
What holds you back?

227
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,700
Perhaps the courage to face it alone.

228
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,900
What if you had someone to join you?

229
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,700
MAN: The herald returns!

230
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,100
The Queen asks the King's forgiveness.

231
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,940
She cannot leave her guests.

232
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,780
<i>VASHTI: I'm queen, not a pawn,</i>

233
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,380
and I will not lower my dignity

234
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,940
or shame my reign

235
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,660
by wearing the royal crown
before your drunk

236
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,500
and thinly veiled war council.

237
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,220
MAN 1: What news of the Queen?

238
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,980
MAN 2: Where is our queen?

239
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,940
WOMAN: Queen Vashti!

240
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,300
MAN 3: Queen Vashti!

241
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,100
Am I to be a mockery before my subjects?

242
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,500
Or Greece as well?

243
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,260
- Continue, Cousin.
- Might not this

244
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,420
deed of refusal

245

travel abroad to all women,

246
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,900
making their husbands
contemptible in their eyes?

247
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,820
Will not it be said by all, "Xerxes
commanded his wife to come before him,

248
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,020
"but she came not"?

249
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,780
Vashti's guilty not only of
disobedience to the crown

250
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,140
but against the protocol of our fathers.

251
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,500
And tell me,

252
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,260
what dictates the protocol?

253
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,420
A royal edict must be issued

254
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,180
and written into the rolls of the land

255
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,500
that Vashti...

256
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,700
That Vashti come no more before the King,

257
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,020
but that her royal position
be given to a new queen,

258
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,060
more worthy

259
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,980
than her.

260
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,580
My lord,
what answer do I send the Queen?

261
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,260
Vashti!

262
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,700
Vashti!

(ALL CHANTING)

264
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,700
The land has no more queen!

265
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,260
I wish not to be queen here any longer.

266
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,140
Mordecai is giving me his blessing.

267
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,820
Let us leave tomorrow,

268
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,140
together.

269
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,100
<i>MORDECAI:
Thus the scribes were assembled,</i>

270
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,060
<i>and a decree sent forth.</i>

<i>In accordance with the protocol,</i>

279

<i>young men were also rounded up</i>

280
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,660
<i>to become eunuchs</i>

281

<i>who would serve the queen's candidates</i>

<i>during their time of preparation.</i>

<i>MORDECAI: There's no need for alarm.</i>

284
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,420
In all likelihood they will not come for you.

285
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,660
And not all that are taken will be chosen.

286
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,260
Doubtless, the queen
has already been selected

287
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,380
through bribery or chicanery.

288
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,460
How do I keep our laws?

289
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,020
How do I pray?

290
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,020
What excuse do I offer God
for not keeping his commandments?

291
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,940
Oh, Hadassah.

292
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,060
God sees the inward observance.

293
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,540
The court is a dangerous place.

294
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,140
I think it will be better

295
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,340
if you forgot that you were a Jew.

296
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,300
If this is a sin, then...

297
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,740
Then let it be on my head.

298
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,620
Promise me that you will do that
if you're taken. Promise me that!

299
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,540
If I am taken,

300
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,660
I will do as you say.

301
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,380
I should give you a different name.
Hadassah is too Jewish.

302
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,780
Esther.

303
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,820
Esther is a good Babylonian name.

304
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,540
Yes. That's what we shall call you
from now on.

305
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,860
Esther of Susa.

306
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,620
Promise me.

307
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,060
Promise me if you are taken.

308
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,860
I said, "If I am taken."

If, if, if.

But for now,

311
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,340
you should look for me
in the streets of Jerusalem,

312
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,180
dancing

313
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,460
like David before the glory of the Lord.

- Who?

Sarah, it matches your eyes.

325
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,700
Have you ever found anything
so wonderful in your life?

326
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,260
And Hannah,

327
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,500
was it not made for you?

328
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,380
Am I never going to see my mother again?

329
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,740
Only if you wish not to.

330
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,860
Two, three days, and who knows?

331
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,220
Home you go.

332
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:31,420
Do you think we're not beautiful enough
to be asked to stay, Hadassah?

333
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,300
Welcome to a brand-new life.

334
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,100
The method of your arrival
was not of my choosing.

335
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,180
I am Hagai, His Majesty's Royal Eunuch.

336
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,940
I have been assigned
to oversee your preparation.

337
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,980
All right, it's okay.

338

340
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,220
Which way to the quarter of the Jews?

341

<i>(GIRL SCREAMS)</i>

(GIGGLING)

343
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,780
You have a very bad habit.

344
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,340
The palace is no place for children.

345
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,140
You think of me as a child?

346
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,860
Well, you're wrong.

347
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,180
I am much younger than that.

348
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,060
How do they call you?

349
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,540
- Esther.
- Curious name.

350
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,060
From where do you come?

351
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,260
I am of the wind

352
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,300
whose sound is heard, yet none can tell

353
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,580
from whence it comes or where it goes.

354
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,820
Well, we gather within the hour.

355
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,460
Try not to blow away before then.

356
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,020
Another 4,000 talents

357
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,100
for metal, weapons, armor.

358
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,700
And we must not forget
the pay of the mercenaries.

359
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,100
I know this is not a favored opinion,

360
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,820
but if used for peaceful purposes,

361
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,940
such amounts could serve many needs.

362
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,260
Two different ways of life are involved.

363
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,620
The Greeks have no king
and they want none.

364
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,700
It is one thing to beat our chests
and parade our boldness

365
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,180
pretending this is
still the empire of our fathers.

366
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,060
But you hear the costs
of an actual campaign!

367
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,980
If we are not honest with ourselves,

368
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,020
I fear we lose much more
than just our stature.

369
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,980
Then, let us sit back and do nothing?

370
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,380
Let the Greeks conquer.

371
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,620
Let them establish democracy.

372
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,580
Would not the King be the first to suffer,

373
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,140
the first to die?

374
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,420
Or does the memory of his father's death

375
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,940
not stir as deep in his bones
as it does in ours?

376
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,940
I speak to you as one
not without empathy.

377
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,660
I, too, have stood in the battle

378
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,580
and stared into the unknown.

379
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,260
For the very sword that took my eye

380
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,700
took from me my manhood as well.

381
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,700
<i>But be at peace.</i>

382
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,140
<i>This is no warfare that you embark upon.</i>

383
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,060
<i>This is only the life
that a great dreamer could imagine,</i>

384
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,500
<i>or at least it can be,</i>

385
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,500
<i>if you so choose to embrace it.</i>

386
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,860
Think not I heard your
whispered orchestrations that night?

387
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,700
And how you drew even me
into your schemes?

388
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,900
In these troubled times
it is easy to name any man traitor.

389
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,140
I even recall a certain campaign

390
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,380
in Ionia under King Darius,

391
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,420
where someone allowed
the defeated Greeks

392
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,140
to keep their own form of government,

393
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,500
their democracy,

394
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,100
instead of placing the protocol
of the empire in control.

395
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,580
Favoring democracy.

396
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,780
The very doctrine to which
all Persia is opposed.

397
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,540
- I followed orders!
- Come. Come, come, come.

398
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,460

399
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,700
We trouble ourselves with foolish things.

400
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,420
The King asked me to speak. I did.

401
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,180
I obeyed. As you obeyed.

I am curious

411
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,660
to whether you frustrate me
out of sincerity

412
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,580
or to ensure
that you're never chosen queen.

413
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,900
You assume I actually care about
being chosen queen.

414
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,220
I am serious.

415
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,700
Serious of what?

416
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,300
Finding a real queen?

417
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,740
Is that why you subject us
to these beauty treatments,

418
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,540
these classes?

419
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,580
You do not like our fine instructors?

420
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,700
They simply neglect to
teach us some things.

421
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,620
- Such as?
- Well, seemingly

422
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,020
anything to do with actually being queen:

423
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,300
the thought well thought,
the word well spoken

424
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,100
and the deed well done.

425
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,460
As it is said in the great books.

426
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,700
You read?

427
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,540

429
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,660
Before I received your "invitation",

430
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,860
I was reading of
Gilgamesh the Babylonian.

if we grant you the privilege
of picking a queen?

- Misgath of Persepolis.
- Misgath?

447
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,540
Of unusual beauty.

"for serving twenty years
in the Royal Fleet.

487
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:49,460
"After a lengthy speech,
he promptly keeled over and died."

488
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,700
(CHUCKLES)

489
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:00,100
"Twenty-five. Three herd of sheep
were stolen from Dirmalmirah,

490
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,180
"Satrap of Midea.

491
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,100
"He requests that the crown send out
the proper authority."

492
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,620
And so Jacob,

493
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,020
also a shepherd by trade,

494
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,620
was sent off into the far, far-off land

495
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,140
where he came across the fair Rachel
tending her father's sheep.

496
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,260
He was smitten,
and went and rolled the stone

497
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,420
from the well,
and watered her flock for her.

498
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,860
Then Jacob kissed Rachel

499
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,540
and lifted up his voice and wept with joy.

500
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,500
When Laban, Rachel's father, heard of this,

501
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:44,020
he said to Jacob,
"Should you serve me for nothing?

502
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,260
"Tell me, what shall your wages be?"

503
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,420
Jacob said, "I will serve you seven years
for your daughter Rachel."

504
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,380
So Jacob served seven years
tending Laban's sheep.

505
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,220
And they only seemed but a few days,
for the love he had for her.

506
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,940
Then Jacob said to Laban,

507
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,380
"Give me my wife,
for my days are fulfilled."

508
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:09,060
So Laban threw a great wedding feast,
but in the dark of the evening

509
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,700
Laban brought
his older daughter in to Jacob.

510
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:16,180
And, behold, in the morning
it was Leah, not Rachel.

511
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,500
Jacob was shocked. He said to Laban,

512
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,260
"What is this thou hast done unto me?

513
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,780
"Did I not serve with thee for Rachel?

514
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,460
"Why, then, have you beguiled me?"

515
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,900
XERXES: Why, then, have you beguiled me?

516
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,340
I must admit that never before
has such a tale been found

517
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,260
in the pages of a royal diary.

518
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,140
Here I expect to be lulled to sleep
by tedious reports,

519
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,540
instead I'm beguiled by a love story.

520
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,580
And how ends your tale?
This Jacob, he's able to have his bride?

521
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,100
He's able to have her?

522
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,580
Only after serving

523
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,820
seven more years for her, my lord King.

524
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,220
Believeth you in such?

525
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,260
Love?

526
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,660
Is it not the greatest commandment?

527
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,500
No matter what God one serves.

528
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,220
- How do they call you?
- Esther of Susa.

529
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,420
Susa? No.

530
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,900
Nothing good ever comes out of Susa.

531
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,460
Look at me.

532
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:44,180
Come. Come, if you wish to see what I do.

533
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,980
The Greeks, they have a god
of similar form.

534
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,380
His arms will hold the bow,
whose arrows they say are

535
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,620
tipped with love.

536
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,780
Some archers' arrows are tipped
with poison, my lord.

537
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,140
Sometimes

538
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,940
it's hard to tell the difference.
The symptoms are the same.

539
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,740
Perhaps in another time. Some

540
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,900
other place.

541
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,060
You will read to me again.

542

547
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,060

to begin bringing you candidates

They tell me you're called Esther now.

Oh, Jesse.

Hatach.

555
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,900
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
were pagan names, too.

556
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,140
We're in good company.

557
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,620
Their names were Hananiah, Mishael
and Azariah.

558
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,460
They were thrown into the furnace.

559
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:43,140
But then what happened?

560
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:47,460
Come on, I found a way out.

561
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:50,340
And there's a caravan
leaving for Jerusalem tonight.

562
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:53,020
So we can get out of this place.

563
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,660
Escape?

564
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:00,100
Jesse, I... I can't leave.

565
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,980
What if...

566
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,980
- What if I'm chosen?
- What if you're chosen what?

567
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:12,900
What if you're chosen queen?
Look what they've done to us.

568
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,460
What good could come out of any of this?

569
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:22,300
Perhaps, instead of
asking questions of our trials...

570
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,380
Trials are meant to ask questions
of ourselves.

we can't be what I hoped,

- but...
- Jesse.

575

I can't leave. I'm sorry.

to keep their jewelry.

You weep not for the candidates

- My throat is sore.
- Your throat or your heart?

It has only been a few days
since you read for him.

A few days is a thousand years.

surely he would've...

You think a eunuch cannot know love?

Back before I was a cripple of a man,

598

there was one that held my heart.

599

What became of her?

Wait.
You are the one who read to me before.

You tried to beguile me with love stories.

Did you not think I had the sense
to see through your little parable?

as if I was this Rachel

It is, Your Majesty.

You consider yourself of so little worth

- that I can purchase your love so cheaply?
- I was taught

632
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:43,220
that when you visit a king,
rather than expect a gift,

633
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,980
one should bring one to lay at his feet.

This is my most
valuable possession in the world.

It is my past, my present, and my future.

And all of it is yours.

Some would call you foolish indeed,
as they would call your Jacob.

Of all commodities, love is the easiest,

If it is for sale, my lord,

641
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,300
it is not love.

642
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,140
Even you.

643
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,660
Even you must have a price.

I am neither a buyer

nor a seller of love.

Suppose, my lady,

647
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:05,180
a man offered you a more treasured gift,

648
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,940
say, a kingdom.

is your heart.

652
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,500
Then it is yours.

653
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:42,020
And you did not serve
seven years to get it.

654
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:46,260
Tell me Esther of Susa,
who are you really?

655
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,860
Tell me of your people.

Teach me of your ways.

My father taught me

658
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,820
it takes the glory of God

to conceal a matter,

660
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,900
and the honor of kings to search it out.

661
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,180
Then marry me.

come for you after that first night?

How many evenings
I spent counting the stars

would be chosen queen.

Who is she? From whence did she come?
Who are her people?

676
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,220
There is little known about her, my lord.

677
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:33,500
She is called Esther of Susa. An orphan.

- Poison?

He did not, my lord.
He is far too impetuous.

681

- Far too...
- You know about poison.

682

Of course you do.

you wanted to poison another.

Suppose... Suppose this other
remained nameless,

686

but was, in effect, one whom
you had once vowed to protect.

Thank you.

that he should have raised up
my little Hadassah

00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,220
and made her queen.

Have you told anyone our secret?

No.

If you continue to call me Hadassah,
it will no longer matter.

Will you not join me in the palace?

I could have you named
to any post you desire.

My Lord will take care of me.

Remember not his orders?

Procure it not from the palace,
so nothing can be traced back to us.

The King should be notified at once,

He and Memucan are a day's ride away
at the training grounds.

739

Then it would be better, my lady,
if I send for the captain of the guard

- to investigate.
- Who else is closest to the King?

This is treachery.

If my lady will permit, I myself
will bring these two eunuchs to you.

I interrogated them both.

I'm convinced they plotted alone.

Make sure Mordecai's name
is entered in the chronicles

he may be properly rewarded by the King.

for spying for me will be reduced?

When? When?

812
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,620
Ask of Memucan

813
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:04,180
why he allowed the Greeks of Ionia
to retain their democracy.

814
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,940
Ask whose voice is loudest
against the war today

815
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:11,540

HAMAN: My lady.

819
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:39,740
Are you alone?

820
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:48,140
- Highly unsafe.
- I was just finishing.

821
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:57,580
Please.

822
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,420
Allow me.

823
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:23,420
- Shall I return this for you?
- Thank you.

824
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:30,940
Something must weigh heavy
on my queen's heart

825
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:33,900
in order to be kept up
at this hour, reading.

826
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,860
My queen.

827
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:49,460
- Is her Highness unwell?
- I'm fine.

828
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:52,700
Perhaps I should retire.

MEMUCAN: You're not scheduled
at the palace for more than two weeks.

831
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,340
She'll be wonderfully surprised,
think you not?

832
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,620
Here, read this, my lord.

833
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:15,300
You do not appear
to be a traitor, Memucan.

834
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:17,260
Return with me, and I'll have
Admantha investigate

835
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:18,940
Haman's accusations immediately.

836
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:21,500
Haman is my appointment.

837
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:23,980
And we do need him more than we realize.

838
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:26,220
Truly, Memucan, at one moment you sulk,

839
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:29,540
you say your name has been slurred,
now you plead for your accuser.

840
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:32,740
I have enough lives on my conscience.

841
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:36,660
Chastise him mildly,
and he will perform his duty well

842
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:40,100
and be more grateful to you
for your leniency.

843
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,140
Spoken like a true Persian.

844
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:46,180
Never judging a man before all the good
and all the bad are weighed.

- MORDECAI: So you burnt the evidence?
- Worry not, action will still be taken.

847
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:57,020
Lest you forget, this Haman
is now head of internal protection.

848
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:59,420
And lest you forget, I'm still queen.

849
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:02,940
Yes, but queen subject to
an ancient protocol that no doubt Haman

850
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:05,140
knows how to manipulate
far better than you do.

851
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,460
Go not by the main gate.

852
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:17,300
I wish not for the Queen
to be alerted to my coming.

01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:20,580
You must promise me

855
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:23,340
that you will not reveal this to anyone.

856
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:29,180
Any more such promises
and I shall have to take a vow of silence.

Rusty old lovers' gate.

858
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:37,340
I trust you used it much
in your youth, Memucan.

859
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:40,780
Who do you think had it installed?

860
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:45,220
Go now.

861
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:03,980
My love. Oh, how I've missed you.

862
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:06,660
- Have you?
- Now, what is that supposed to mean?

863
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:09,580
You looked flushed. Busy morning?

864
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:12,140
Not as busy as it could get.

865
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:13,420
No visitors?

866
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:19,500
You sent for me, Your Highness?

867
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:23,780
It appears you have
misplaced our necklace.

868
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:27,180
I wonder if that is all you have misplaced.

for one of the concubines.

871
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,580
Perhaps not.

872
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:36,380
You look so much like your father.

873
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:39,300
Sometimes I forget
how different you truly are.

874
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:44,140
Makes me wonder all the more why
you feel such need to follow in his steps.

875
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:49,740
Give her a few more nights,

876
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:55,700
and then have her brought to me.

877
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:01,780
ADMANTHA:
You call that public tirade subtle?

878
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:03,380
You mock me, Agagite.

879
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:06,140
I need but report
but once to the King of your arrogance.

880
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:09,580
And your dreams of kingship die with me.

881
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:12,660
You might be less harsh on the Jews.

882
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,420
You should make yourself
a laughing stock.

883
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:15,980
The Jews, my prince,

884
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:19,580
will be your chief weapon by which
you attain power to the throne.

885
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:23,500
Think, we plan to take the crown by force
when the King is deep in Greece.

886
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,940
What excuse will you use?

887
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:28,380
Who attacks the land?

888
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:30,380
Well, no one, actually.

889
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:34,940
Unless, of course,
you claim it was the Greek-loving Jews.

890
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:40,260
Memucan expects an apology,
as you predicted.

891
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:43,980
Well, an apology is a cheap enough price
to pay for a kingdom.

892
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:46,620
<i>Invite, then, Memucan to your estate.</i>

893
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:50,180
<i>Presumably so I can apologize to him.</i>

894
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:53,580

he will be ambushed.</i>

- By my Jews, of course.</i>

for being coupled with them as a traitor.

897
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:03,380
- And what of Memucan's own guard?
- It's merely an apology.

898
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,940
Perhaps you can suggest to Memucan

899
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:07,340
that if he arrive with a large number,

900
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:08,980
I might suspect he'd come
to punish me.

901
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:11,380
One or two guards my men can handle.

902
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:14,420
And who'll handle you?

903
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:16,700
Who but you,

You are needed at once.

912
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:51,260
But lord King,
an accusation by a dispatch ride.

913
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:54,060
Why did you wait so long
to inform anyone of Admantha's plot?

914
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:57,340
- Surely you don't...
- My lord, I had to but play the traitor

915
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,140
to catch the traitor.

916
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:04,260
Where are his witnesses, my lord?
What were my motives?

917
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:08,780
Let this Haman prove his words
or be forever silent.

918
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:10,380
But what would he have
me show, my lord?

919
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:13,420
There are no witnesses
to plans forged in secret.

920
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,340
You will not act like that, Admantha.

921
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:19,180
And was it not even Admantha
who stirred the crowd into demanding

922
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:22,820
Queen Vashti's appearance,
knowing she would not come?

923
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,380
All lies. That's lies.

924
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:28,580
Lies. I stand in a crumbling house of lies.

925
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:31,860
- Remember before whom you plead.
- Plead for what?

For your life, Admantha.

You placed them back

01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:17,620
My burden I would not wish on any man.

965
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:23,220
The blood of my forefathers
will be avenged.

966
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:28,180
And the gods will smile down on our son
through our obedience.

967
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:31,580
And are you mad? This is your plan?

968
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:34,660
It is not that our allies
are unwilling, my lord,

969
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:36,500
but they have not fared well.

970
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:39,180
A storm has robbed the Phoenicians
of a good part of their fleet.

971
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:42,900
Carthage finds herself short in timber
with which to complete our warships...

972
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:45,660
Surely the fate of the empire
does not hinge on money?

973
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:48,780
- Are you ready to furnish it, then?
- No, not I, my lord.

974
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:51,580
But I'm aware of traitors
within our borders that could.

975
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,900
The Jews? We are not children.

976
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:55,420
Nevertheless, the money may be raised

977
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:58,300
by the confiscation
of Jewish wealth and property.

978
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:01,180
And the Jews will just
hand it over without a fight?

979
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:02,820
No, of course not.

980
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:05,740
First we must kill them all.

981
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:08,820
Every last one of them.

982
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:12,020
It is the only way to ensure
they do not rise up and seek revenge.

983
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:14,500
He speaks of women
and children, my lord.

984
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:16,460
Yes, women and children.

985
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,700
I know.

986
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:24,420
What is your solution?

987
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:28,260
Or would you rather, my dear Memucan,
the Greeks and the Jews unite

988
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:30,860
and, hand in hand,
murder us in our beds while we sleep?

989
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:34,100
Is the past so mighty
that we must destroy our brothers

990
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:35,980
to be free of its grasp?

991
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:42,660
No kingdom was ever so grand
as the Jews' own King Solomon.

992
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:46,380
He fought not one battle,
toiled through not one war,

993
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:50,380
but prospered upon the peace
handed down by his father.

994
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:54,740
Do not make void what your
own father's death has purchased.

995
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:57,820
- By picking back up...
- Mind your tone, General.

996
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:00,380
Why thirst you for warfare

997
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:03,900
when we can drink so deeply of peace?

998
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:07,300
You speak of peace,
let us speak of the Jews.

999
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:11,420
They would rather bow down to their own
God than obey the laws of protocol.

1000
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:14,060
Their prophets even speak
of a coming king.

1001
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:17,860
A king who will reign over all kings
and set all men free.

1002
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:23,860
Is that not the very essence of democracy,
my dear Memucan?

1003
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:26,380
I do believe, under your guidance,
we are undone.

1004
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:29,620
If we are undone,
we are undone from within, indeed.

1005
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:33,740
March upon Greece, if you wish.

1006
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:36,540
But you march
with no general in your lead.

1007
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:46,500
Then it has not yet been signed into law?

1008
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,900
Not as yet, my lady.

1009
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:53,660
Perhaps guilt stirs men too hotly at times,

1010
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:56,180
and they seek the salve of the law

1011
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:58,500
to ease the burning.

1012
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:03,180
And what would you have me do?

1013
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:07,060
I cannot seek him in the library
unless summoned.

1014
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:17,580
<i>If you arrived first,</i>

1015
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:21,020
<i>then he in effect
would be seeking you, would he not?</i>

1016
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:29,420
How came you pass my guard?
I demanded none use the library this night.

1017
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,900
I seek that which you seek, my lord.

1018
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:37,780
Truth.

1019
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:42,660
Perhaps the truth
of what exists between us?

1020
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:45,780
I have come on matters of state.

1021
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:47,420
Matters of state.

1022
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:49,740
I see.

1023
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:53,900
And what matters of state might that be?

1024
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:56,660
You desire more perfumes?
You request more condiments?

1025
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:59,220
Surely as queen of the kitchen,
you need not await me here.

1026
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:03,220
You know as well as I how quickly word
travels throughout the palace.

1027
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:07,060
Especially when murder's involved.

1028
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:10,500
You are... You are learned, well-read.

1029
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,620
Offer me a story that
answers my dilemma.

1030
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:16,780
- I have never pretended with you.
- Never pretended?

1031
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:18,460
Think you not that I see
Memucan's strings

1032
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:19,980
dangling above your head even now?

1033
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,740
You care more for these Jews
than you do for me.

1034
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:26,100
Do you enquire of my burdens,
do you offer me solutions?

1035
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:27,300
No.

1036
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:29,460
You just complain.

1037
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:32,420
- As Vashti did?
- Away from me!

1038
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:35,020
And come before me no longer,
no matter what pretense you seek,

1039
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:37,700
or your fate shall be worse than Vashti.

1040
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:42,620
- But I do love you.
- Love has failed me.

1041
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:46,980
Knowledge has failed me, thus
I bind myself to the protocol

1042
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:49,100
of my fathers and to my empire.

1043
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:51,260
By the next moon, I leave for war.

1044
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:54,940
And whatever my fate,
it shall no longer be shared with you.

1045
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:13,300
This was once your favorite reading.

1046
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:16,420
And though it may no longer
bear the story of love,

1047
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,820
it bears that of one Mordecai the Jew.

1048
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:26,300
One of whom you wish to destroy
saved your life.

1049
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:31,900
And you never even honored him for it.

1050
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:43,420
The casting of the lot, the Pur...

1051
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:47,860
It has determined upon which day
all the Jews of the kingdom will be slain.

1052
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:52,420
This day is to be the 13th day
of the month of Adar

1053
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:54,420
according to the calendar of the Jews.

1054
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:56,020
Prince...

1055
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:01,700
The annihilation of a people

1056
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:07,020
can only be authorized by one
who bears the signet of the King himself.

1057
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:17,780
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

1058
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,660
<i>MORDECAI: And those letters were sent
into all the land,</i>

1059
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:26,460
<i>to slay and annihilate all the Jews</i>

1060
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:29,620
<i>on the 13th of Adar,
some six weeks hence.</i>

1061
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:34,380
<i>Both young and old,
men, women and even children.</i>

1062
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:39,340
<i>And to plunder all of their possessions
for the sake of the crown.</i>

1063
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:12,380
The scribe insists that
all is dependent upon you, my queen.

1064
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:14,900
Dependent upon me?

1065
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:19,020
My queen might wish
to go before the King and intercede

1066
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:23,940
for those that have no other hope.

1067
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:28,220
My lady...

1068
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:30,980
Have you forgotten your protocol?

1069
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:32,980
To approach the King
unsummoned is death.

1070
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:36,500
Perhaps in court.
But surely you can visit him in private.

1071
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:38,740
In his chambers.

1072
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:42,940
Surely I cannot.

1073
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:54,460
<i>ESTHER: Obedient I have been.</i>

1074
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:58,260
<i>I walk before you with a loyal heart.</i>

1075
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:04,620
<i>And now I stand in the hour of trouble
precisely because of my obedience.</i>

1076
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:08,340
I beseech you, Father,

1077
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,460
<i>let there be another way.</i>

1078
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:15,300
<i>Rise up a deliverer and let this pass.</i>

1079
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:18,260
<i>Let this pass.</i>

1080
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:20,660
<i>MORDECAI: "'Comfort,</i>

1081
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:23,420

Kneel before the great prince.

1095
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:12,700
Clear the way for he who comes.
Kneel for the great prince.

1096
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:14,660
You...

1097
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:19,660
Lower yourself to honor
the great Prince Haman. Kneel!

1098
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:21,460
- I said kneel.
- Stop!

1099
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:34,020
- Why do you not kneel?
- I kneel before my king.

1100
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:37,940
I abase myself
only before the God of my fathers.

1101
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:41,420
- What's his name, this God?
- The great I AM.

1102
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:44,820
The one true God,
the maker of heaven and earth.

1103
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,660
The God of Abraham,
of Isaac and of Jacob.

1104
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:52,380
A Jew.

1105
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:55,300
Mordecai Ben-Yair.

1106
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:57,780
Mordecai...

1107
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:03,380
I shall name my prize pig after you.

1108
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:07,020
Perhaps I may give you other reasons
to remember my name.

1109
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:09,140
You will remember mine

1110
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:11,220
for this!

1111
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:18,260
Move on.

MAN: What good did that do?

1113
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:27,460
You still ended up
on the ground like the rest of us.

1114
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:33,260
But I did not kneel.

1115
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:39,580
Come, now, you are a mere three days
from being handed a kingdom.

1116
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:43,700
We must not let one Jew rob us of our joy.

1117
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,700
That is not good enough.

1118
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:50,540
Then seek permission
to honor the King's departure

1119
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:52,500
with a public execution of a rebel

1120
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:53,500
<i>(ECHOING)</i>

1121
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:57,220
<i>a symbol of your authority
over those that remain.</i>

1122
01:28:57,340 --> 01:29:02,060
<i>A gallows, 50 cubits high
with Mordecai right...</i>

1123
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:21,940
The chronicles.

1124
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:38,860
XERXES: Rise.

1125
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:41,940
A matter disturbs me.
You may be of assistance.

1126
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:46,380
I am most pleased, my lord,
for I, too, desire your counsel on a matter.

1127
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:49,300
A certain man
has rendered great service to me.

1128
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:52,060
He has received many honors
amongst his people,

1129
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:54,060
but he once saved my life.

1130
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:59,220
I feel, despite everything, full recognition

1131
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:01,140
has not yet been given him.

1132
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:04,140
What think you, shall be done
for this man in whom the King delights

1133
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:05,460
to honor?

1134
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,980
Let a royal robe be sent for,

1135
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:12,180
one his Majesty has donned in public.

1136
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:16,980
And a horse

1137
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:21,740
on whose head a royal crest is set.

1138
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:28,820
Deliver them to
one of the noblest princes of the Fars,

1139
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:32,380
so that he can array the man
in whom the King delights.

1140
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:37,100
And then parade this man
through the streets, proclaiming,

1141
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:41,580
"Thus shall it be done to the man
in whom the King delights to honor."

1142
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:44,940
Most excellent proposal.

1143
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:48,620
Go yourself now
and do all you have suggested.

1144
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:50,100
My lord.

1145
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:53,140
To a one Mordecai,

1146
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:57,740
the scribe who
sits within the King's gates.

1147
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:03,140
Mordecai?

1148
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:05,940
The Jew?

1149
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:22,340
My lady.

1150
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:26,700
- And who is this honored man?
- A scribe.

1151
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:31,580
A Jewish scribe,
who claims to have saved the King's life.

1152
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:39,380
I should think you would be honored
by such a privilege given by the King.

1153
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:40,620
Honored?

1154
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:48,060
The prestige of Persia is at stake.

1155
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:50,900
What will it be said of your husband,
the king, that he commands

1156
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:53,580
his highest prince
to lead a Jew through the streets?

1157
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:55,180
A Jew, my lady!

1158
01:31:56,180 --> 01:32:00,580
And how is a Jew
any different than you or I?

1159
01:32:00,740 --> 01:32:01,820
They are our enemy.

1160
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:04,820
They must be destroyed.

1161
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:09,780
They may be your enemy, but not mine.

1162
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:12,420
From the way that you defend them,

1163
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:18,420
- one might almost think...
- One might think what,

1164
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:21,580
my prince?

1165
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:31,340
One might think. That is all, my lady.

1166
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:35,180
One might think.

1167
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:45,300
HAMAN: Make your way for Mordecai,
the Jew.

(CROWD CHEERING)

Make your way for Mordecai,
who saved the King's life.

1170
01:32:50,780 --> 01:32:53,820
He is the man in whom
the King delights to honor.

1171
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:59,300
All hail for Mordecai, the Jew,
honored of the King.

1172

Beloved of the Queen.
All hail for Mordecai, the Jew.

My queen,
I bring you word from Mordecai.

1177
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:51,900
You've run out of time.

1178
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:56,460
When the King leaves
for Greece tomorrow,

1179
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:58,980
he will appoint Haman as his regent.

1180
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:03,420
It is our last chance
to stop this edict of death.

1181
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:07,460
He made me vow to speak his words.

1182
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:14,620
You will indeed risk your life
if you go before the King...

will save you alone from this edict.</i>

<i>For if you keep silent,

1188
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:36,980
will surely perish.

1189
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:42,580
Who knows whether
you have come to the palace

1190
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:45,460
for such a time as this?

1191
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:54,500
He said to give you this.

1192
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:09,140
Tell Mordecai to assemble the Jews.

1193
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:12,180
Ask them to fast and pray.

1194
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:15,100
I will do the same.

1195
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:20,300
And in the morning,
arrange for me a litter.

1196
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:26,020
I will array myself as queen
and go before the King unsummoned,

1197
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:30,740
even though it is against the law.

1198
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:40,260
And if I perish,

1199
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:43,540
I perish.

to raid and rule the world over

- What?

The King leaves for the outpost
within the hour.

1210

I have not time to wait out this rain.

I am not going to allow you

- Please tell me you did not.
- What possible assurance do you have

01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:38,580
he would lower his scepter
to spare your life?

1215
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:43,820
You do not go into a bedroom of a man,
you go into the hall of a king.

1216
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:47,780
This is not you against him.
This is you against protocol.

1217
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:49,980
You against the empire.

1218
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:54,660
Then I... I go as

1219

David did
before Goliath and the Philistines.

1220

Those are just stories, Esther.
Do you hear me? Just stories.

Know you what I love most
about the story of David and Goliath?

1222

David's victory
came not because he fought well

1258

is that you allow me to finish a story.

One that I began many nights ago.

1260

1261
01:43:28,340 --> 01:43:31,060
does not finish with marrying Rachel.

1262

Well, they go on to have 12 sons.

1263

And like these 12 pillars that surround us,
they became the pillars of a people.

Surely you do not delay an army
only to finish a children's tale?

If I still find favor in your sight,

1267

let my life be given me, at my petition.

You have yet to tell me who they are.

Had we been merely sold as slaves,
I would have held my tongue.

01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:28,020
This Haman wanted our blood,

1274
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:32,980
my blood, the blood of Jacob, your Jacob.

1275
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:36,660
Your Jacob was given a new name.

1276
01:44:37,660 --> 01:44:38,780
Israel.

1277
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:43,540
As, too, was I.

1278
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:46,540
You, Esther?

1279
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:49,180
A Jew?

1280
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:54,380
Not Esther, my lord.

1281
01:45:04,220 --> 01:45:07,020
Hadassah Bat-Abihail,

1282
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:11,340
daughter of the tribe of Benjamin,

1283
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:14,700
child of the most high God.

1284
01:45:16,660 --> 01:45:20,220
Never have I heard
a more pathetic story in my entire life.

1285
01:45:20,620 --> 01:45:22,020
She is no Jew.

1286
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:24,420
She's another Vashti.

1287
01:45:24,940 --> 01:45:27,140
Seems it not convenient to you?

1288
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:29,020
An army marches,

1289
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:32,940
and suddenly she is a Jew.

1290
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:40,060
Esther is a Jew.

1291
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:43,300
Your Vashti but protested
the notion of war.

1292
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:47,780
This queen seeks to counter
the very authority of your rule.

1293
01:45:47,940 --> 01:45:51,700
A Jew? If such were true,
why did she hide it till now?

1294
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:54,180
Pray, do tell us.

1295
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:03,980
The Almighty has indeed ordained

1296
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:08,580
that my words speak not truth unto you.
At least allow my heart.

1297
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:17,300
For this

1298
01:46:18,540 --> 01:46:22,380
which I have offered you,
my most precious in all the world,

1299
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:25,980
the very identity etched within me.

1300
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:42,540
Well, is something supposed
to be happening here?

1301
01:46:45,860 --> 01:46:49,060
The stars... Do you not see them?

1302
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:00,020
Do you not see them?

1303
01:47:05,780 --> 01:47:07,060
A mockery.

1304
01:47:28,580 --> 01:47:31,380
Perhaps not how
you had hoped it would end?

1305
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:35,380
Imagined you that I would beg?

1306
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:42,540
Think you I will beg?

1307
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:44,780
Beg for my life?

1308
01:47:45,140 --> 01:47:49,180
Beg like my forefather Agag
before your sword?

1309
01:47:49,820 --> 01:47:52,140
Would you like me to beg for you?

1310
01:48:03,740 --> 01:48:04,660
Oh,

1311
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:09,060
please, my lady.

1312
01:48:12,940 --> 01:48:15,100
Please, Your Highness.

1313
01:48:16,180 --> 01:48:19,860
Please spare me.

1314
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:25,100
Spare me my life. You are a lady of mercy.

1315
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:26,940
Spare me.

1316
01:48:27,860 --> 01:48:30,540
I beg for forgiveness.

1317
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:35,020
Spare me, spare me, you Jew!

Would he also assault the Queen,

1320
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:41,980
my wife,

1321
01:48:44,020 --> 01:48:46,500
while I am in my house?

1322
01:48:50,580 --> 01:48:54,740
Harbonah has informed me that
the gallows post stands in Haman's yard

1323
01:48:54,860 --> 01:48:59,620
even as we speak. Apparently
intended for one Mordecai the Jew.

1324
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:01,900
Hang him on it.

1325
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:03,700
No!

1326
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:05,060
No!

1328
01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:16,100
What made you come back?

1329
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:19,580
I saw them.

1330
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:25,900
I saw the stars.
