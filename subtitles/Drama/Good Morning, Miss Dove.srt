1
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:28,291
'This is Liberty Hill, a small town,

2
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:35,856
..where streets are named for trees
and heroes and a sense of life's
continuity runs in the air. '

3
00:01:35,856 --> 00:01:41,468
'Like a hundred other such towns
it puts a special stamp on its own. '

4
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:49,584
'People born and raised here,
high and low, rich and poor, are
neighbours in an irrevocable way. '

5
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:55,028
'They have all been exposed
at a tender, malleable age...

6
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:59,638
..to the impartial justice,
inflexible regulations...

7
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:05,163
.. and the grey, calm, neutral eyes
of the same teacher -
the Terrible Miss Dove. '

10
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:46,983
Good morning, Miss Dove.
Mr Porter.
What are you using on your lilies?

12
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:52,476
Sulphate of ammonia -
the best fertilizer.
Except for lilies.

14
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:56,392
Particularly for lilies.
They will perish.

15
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:05,973
There she goes, Jincey -
8.15 on the dot!

16
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:11,528
I wish Little Whosit would copy
Miss Dove's sense of time.

17
00:03:11,528 --> 00:03:17,003
Who could stand it? Imagine burping
a baby that resembled Miss Dove!

18
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:28,218
Seventeen minutes past eight.
Eat up. Miss Dove just went by.

20
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:32,100
You don't want to be tardy.
Oh, puke! The oatmeal stinks.

22
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:36,662
Excuse yourself and get to school!
Yes, sir. Excuse me.

23
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:40,189
Go on!

26
00:03:43,738 --> 00:03:51,543
Good morning, Miss Dove.
Good morning, Mr Levine.
Morrie is coming home to visit.
He will want to see his old teacher.

27
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:54,196
I shall be happy to see Maurice.

30
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:04,482
Good morning, Miss Dove.
Good morning, William.

31
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:23,373
Bobsie! Mark, how's that left foot?

35
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:30,097
OK.
Peggie, how's my best girl?
Fine.
Well, what a pretty pink dress.

36
00:04:30,097 --> 00:04:33,739
It's orange, Mr Spivey.
My mother made it.

37
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:35,901
She did?

38
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:42,104
Isn't he cute with the small fry?
He oughtta have oodles of his own.

39
00:04:42,104 --> 00:04:46,191
It's a shame such a family man
never married.

40
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:51,399
Good morning, Miss Dove.
John, send me a fast one!

42
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:57,834
 Nice try, Mr Spivey.
Let me caddy for you.
Please don't bother, Miss Elwood.

43
00:04:57,834 --> 00:05:03,007
Spring's in the air. Baseball games,
state proficiency tests coming up...

45
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:08,563
Is Cedar Grove going for
the geography pennant again?
The children will try hard.

46
00:05:08,878 --> 00:05:12,720
The results will reflect credit
on all concerned.

47
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,642
I heard what you said about spring.

48
00:05:15,642 --> 00:05:19,649
It makes you want
to do something mad! Whooh!

52
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:30,782
Good morning, Miss Dove.
Good morning, Perry.
Good morning, Miss Dove.

55
00:05:30,782 --> 00:05:34,574
Good morning, Terry.
Good morning, Miss Dove.
Good morning, Robert.

58
00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:39,017
Good morning, Miss Dove.
Good morning, Mark.
I forgot my handkerchief.

61
00:05:39,017 --> 00:05:47,392
First things first, Harrison.
Good morning, Miss Dove.
Good morning, Harrison.
You may take a tissue from my desk.

64
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:52,475
Good morning, Miss Dove.
Good morning, Margaret.
Good morning, Miss Dove.

66
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,600
Attention, please. 

67
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:03,920
The lesson will begin.

68
00:06:04,513 --> 00:06:09,396
We will continue with our study of
the dietary habits of animals.

69
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:16,920
"Bears like honey. They are also fond
of red ants which have a flavour
similar to that of pickles. "

70
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:22,215
Robert!

71
00:06:24,965 --> 00:06:27,379
You know what to do, Robert.

72
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:50,320
You may return to your desk, Robert.

74
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:57,236
We will resume.

75
00:06:57,635 --> 00:07:02,439
"The camel is not a pretty beast,
but he can go days without water. "

76
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:09,332
Margaret, you will now occupy
the posture correction stool.

78
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,650
We will resume.

79
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:34,418
You better tank up!

80
00:07:34,418 --> 00:07:39,501
"The camel is not a pretty beast,
but he can go days without water. "

81
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,533
Who's afraid of that old... stick?

83
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:46,154
Good morning, Miss Dove.
Good morning, David.

84
00:07:46,826 --> 00:07:51,630
The state proficiency tests
will be held next Monday.

85
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:57,037
I think it would be advisable
to utilise this period for review.

86
00:07:58,513 --> 00:08:04,319
No, David. You had ample opportunity
to quench your thirst before class.

87
00:08:05,157 --> 00:08:07,559
Take out your books, please.

88
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:15,970
I advise that you memorise the
agriculture of the Argentine pampas.

89
00:08:21,207 --> 00:08:23,939
'That's strange. A sharp pain. '

90
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:28,778
'Probably a muscular spasm. '

91
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:34,101
'If I tranquillize my mind
it will pass. '

92
00:08:36,257 --> 00:08:42,028
'I will think about the Alps - white,
clean, rising above Lake Lucerne. '

93
00:08:44,922 --> 00:08:46,959
Come back, Victoria.

94
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:49,235
Hellfire and damnation!

95
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:51,557
You will remain after class, David.

96
00:08:52,437 --> 00:08:54,554
Yes, Miss Dove.

97
00:09:05,155 --> 00:09:07,169
Open your notebook to a blank page.

98
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:15,051
You will copy that sentence 2 times.

99
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:19,444
You will copy that sentence 20 times.
Before lunch?

100
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:24,293
By the time you have finished,
the cafeteria will still be open.

101
00:09:40,657 --> 00:09:42,668
David...

102
00:09:42,668 --> 00:09:44,709
Yes, Miss Dove?

104
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:49,001
Is your father likely to be home?
But I'm doing the sentences.

105
00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:54,473
Answer my question. Your father,
does he come home for lunch?

106
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,723
Yes, Miss Dove. Daddy's home.

107
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:03,329
I am indisposed, David.

108
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:06,953
I... I am ill.

109
00:10:06,953 --> 00:10:13,692
Will you go and tell your father?
Ask him to call young Dr Hurley.

110
00:10:14,678 --> 00:10:16,852
Mention this to no-one.

111
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:22,454
David, do not loiter.

112
00:10:22,643 --> 00:10:24,494
Run.

113
00:10:24,494 --> 00:10:29,457
I'll take a short cut through
where the old bank used to be!

114
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:36,498
'"Where the old bank used to be. "'

116
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:01,797
Hello there! Home from school?

118
00:11:01,797 --> 00:11:07,841
Good afternoon, Mrs Aldrich.
I returned today.
Welcome home. Nice to see you.

120
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:15,890
Thank you, Dr Hurley, nice to
see you. How is young Dr Hurley?
He celebrated
his 45th birthday yesterday.

121
00:11:17,487 --> 00:11:22,330
Look at her, John. Hasn't she
something that sets her apart?

122
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:27,373
It's like the difference between
fine porcelain and ordinary ware.

124
00:11:27,373 --> 00:11:36,219
That school should've
given her something, it cost enough.
Not as much as it cost your father
to send you to Harrow and Oxford.

125
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:38,620
Quality can't be purchased.

126
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,463
Whatever that girl becomes
is certain to be remarkable.

127
00:11:43,463 --> 00:11:47,476
As her father, you're biased -
but you may be right.

129
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:52,629
Welcome home.
Thank you, sir.
It's pleasant to see you, Mr Porter.

132
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:59,873
The feeling is mutual.
I hope Mrs Porter is well.
Yes. She told me to find out
when you both can come to dinner.

134
00:11:59,873 --> 00:12:06,717
Then again, I expect you met
some dashing young men while away.
I met one I liked very much.

136
00:12:06,717 --> 00:12:11,520
What's that?
He's an archaeology major
at Princeton.

137
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,298
Tell me later. I have a surprise.

138
00:12:14,452 --> 00:12:20,526
From my London dealer, that elusive
edition of Marco Polo's travels.

140
00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:27,370
Oh, I know how happy you are.
But you haven't opened it.
So I could share it with you tonight

141
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,383
Let's go. Dinner can be early.
May we give you a ride?

143
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:39,778
No, I have things to attend to
- it's the first of the month.
While you're about it,
send a draft for the book - $200.

144
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:43,877
If they'd only known -
I was ready to go to five!

145
00:12:49,114 --> 00:12:51,163
$200!

146
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,643
From 13th C Venice to Old Cathay,
what a time to have lived!

147
00:13:03,643 --> 00:13:09,039
Next year, I've decided, we'll make
the grandest of grand tours.

148
00:13:09,196 --> 00:13:12,849
I'll show you
every corner of the world.

150
00:13:12,849 --> 00:13:19,052
Last summer, Mr Pendleton
rode a bicycle through Greece.
Who's Mr Pendleton?

151
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:21,454
Papa, you never listen.

152
00:13:21,454 --> 00:13:25,096
He's the young man from Princeton
I told you of.

153
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,498
Oh, yes, the archaeologist.

154
00:13:27,818 --> 00:13:31,426
His name is
Welford Banning Pendleton III.

156
00:13:38,264 --> 00:13:40,348
Lovely, my dear.

157
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:46,470
Mr Pendleton wrote me a letter.

158
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:53,599
He asked leave to visit me
this summer, here in Liberty Hill.

160
00:14:00,598 --> 00:14:02,647
Papa!

161
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:08,170
Henry! Henry!

162
00:14:10,244 --> 00:14:14,138
Call Dr Hurley!
Something's happened to my...

163
00:14:23,773 --> 00:14:27,381
It's too late for Dr Hurley,
Miss Dove.

166
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:44,223
Miss Dove is here.

167
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,432
Have her come in, please.

168
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:53,833
Thank you for coming.
Won't you please sit down?

169
00:14:58,912 --> 00:15:04,081
What I must tell you is as painful
to me as it will be for you.

170
00:15:04,716 --> 00:15:04,716
I should like to have put it off...

171
00:15:04,716 --> 00:15:08,769
I should like to have put it off...
Tell me, Mr Porter.

172
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:17,457
Your father availed himself of
the bank's assets without first
observing the conventional forms.

173
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:21,730
He stole? Are you saying
that my father stole?

174
00:15:21,978 --> 00:15:24,265
Let us say he "borrowed".

175
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:24,820
How much, Mr Porter?

176
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:30,784
How much, Mr Porter?
$11,430 to be exact -
in dribbles, here and there.

178
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:37,431
No more than he could have
hoped to return one day.
$11,430!

179
00:15:38,308 --> 00:15:40,738
This must be repaid, at once.

181
00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:47,831
By whom?
By me, of course. There's the house,
the rare editions, the paintings.

182
00:15:48,663 --> 00:15:53,757
Their disposal will more than cover
my father's... indebtedness.

183
00:15:53,757 --> 00:15:58,767
It won't be as simple as that.
I've been going over his books.

184
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:03,236
The house, everything,
is mortgaged to the hilt.

185
00:16:03,352 --> 00:16:11,569
Your father was one of my closest
friends. Were I able, I would
happily cover this "indebtedness"...

187
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:17,738
.. before there is any scandal.
Scandal? There must be no scandal!

188
00:16:18,373 --> 00:16:20,094
I don't see how it can be avoided.

189
00:16:20,094 --> 00:16:27,819
Can't the bank make over to me
this deficit as a personal loan?

190
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:30,220
But how could you repay it?

191
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,349
I shall secure employment.

192
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,355
A position. A teaching position.

193
00:16:37,654 --> 00:16:42,508
A teaching position? My dear child,
what are you prepared to teach?

194
00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:45,593
I know a great deal about the world.

195
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,997
I cannot imagine a young lady
who knows less.

196
00:16:50,153 --> 00:16:54,956
I should have been more explicit.
Not the world, the Earth.

197
00:16:55,156 --> 00:17:00,643
I have read my father's books.
I could find my way through Carthage.

198
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:05,092
I can point out on a map of Iowa
the best cornfields.

199
00:17:05,322 --> 00:17:09,925
I know every turn of the Nile
and eddy of the Mississippi.

200
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:15,252
I'm not even certain that I couldn't
locate the Northwest Passage.

201
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:20,896
I am superbly qualified to teach
geography, and I will teach it.

202
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,654
There will be no scandal.

203
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:27,307
I will repay my father's debt.

204
00:17:29,337 --> 00:17:35,348
You are president of this bank.
You can arrange a personal loan.

205
00:17:39,383 --> 00:17:45,394
I'll try, as you're so determined,
but I can't guarantee anything.

206
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:53,232
Thank you. Meanwhile, I will make
my application to the school board.

207
00:17:53,232 --> 00:17:55,770
Good morning, Mr Porter.

209
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:14,325
Is there anything you wish,
Mr Porter?
Yes. Get me
the Superintendent of Schools.

210
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:16,385
Yes, sir.

211
00:18:19,168 --> 00:18:22,014
"Dear Mr Pendleton...

212
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:27,859
"..The news that you
have been awarded a fellowship...

213
00:18:28,694 --> 00:18:31,471
".. by the Carnegie Foundation...

214
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:35,426
".. is most gratifying.

215
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,221
"Much to my regret,...

216
00:18:44,032 --> 00:18:46,764
"..the death of my father...

217
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:51,527
"..will prevent my receiving you...

218
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,951
"..this summer. "

219
00:18:58,081 --> 00:19:00,243
Mail, Mr Pembleton.

220
00:19:00,843 --> 00:19:02,880
Oh, thank you, Ames.

221
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:27,880
I... I took the liberty...

223
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,653
I had to express my sympathy
in person.
Please come in, Mr Pendleton.

225
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:53,732
Now that I'm here, there's
so little I can say that...
You've said it very well,
Mr Pendleton.

226
00:19:57,338 --> 00:19:59,387
Please sit down.

227
00:20:04,301 --> 00:20:09,230
Welford is an awful name,
but must you call me Mr Pendleton?

228
00:20:09,865 --> 00:20:12,152
My friends call me Woof.

229
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:15,657
I don't suppose you'd care to?

230
00:20:15,657 --> 00:20:19,517
No, but I should like to
call you Welford.

231
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:22,228
Thank you.

232
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:26,275
What does the Carnegie Fellowship
mean, Welford?

234
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:32,319
A year in Tibet
with the Archer expedition.
Tibet? You'll see the Himalayas.

236
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:40,003
We'll sail down the Brahmaputra,
then Lhasa...
Lhasa... One of the oldest cities
in the history of men.

238
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:44,648
On to Shigatse and the sacred lakes.
Wait! I know their names.

239
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:48,093
Manasarowar... and Rakas Tal.

240
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:53,856
Yes! Then along the ancient route
to Kashmir and the Tarim Basin.

241
00:20:53,973 --> 00:20:56,978
Oh, Mr Pendleton,... Welford,...

242
00:20:57,575 --> 00:20:59,817
.. how I envy you.

243
00:20:59,817 --> 00:21:02,343
I don't want you to envy me,...

244
00:21:02,898 --> 00:21:05,425
.. I want you to come with me.

246
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:12,705
Come with you?
From the moment we met
at Miss Kingsley's weekly tea,...

247
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:18,112
.. I felt that our friendship
might ripen into something warmer.

249
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:27,674
Remember, we left the others
and strolled along the river?
We sat on a marble bench and you
described the misty isles of Greece.

250
00:21:27,674 --> 00:21:29,835
We like the same things.

251
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:31,998
Yes, we do.

252
00:21:33,207 --> 00:21:35,639
My assets are not impressive.

253
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:40,295
I have a $1,500 grant
and $5,000 my grandmother left me.

254
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:45,405
But, in all modesty, I feel
I have a future in my chosen field.

255
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:49,531
A bright future, Welford.
An exciting future.

256
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:55,692
Share it with me. Marry me.
Marry me tomorrow. Today.

259
00:21:59,374 --> 00:22:05,100
Let it ring.
Oh, it will only keep on ringing.
I'll be but a moment.

260
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:09,199
Hello?

261
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,945
Oh... Good afternoon, Mr Porter.

262
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,435
Everything's... been arranged?

263
00:22:20,987 --> 00:22:24,390
Yes, I am...fortunate indeed.

264
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:32,442
Will you thank the Superintendent of
Schools? And thank you, Mr Porter.

265
00:22:33,515 --> 00:22:35,575
Goodbye.

266
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,500
Well?

267
00:22:44,772 --> 00:22:49,655
I am afraid, Welford,
that we have been premature.

268
00:22:49,655 --> 00:22:54,982
We've let ourselves be carried away
by the spell of far-off places.

269
00:22:55,368 --> 00:23:00,070
We have placed too much importance
on similar interests.

270
00:23:00,451 --> 00:23:02,903
But I'm asking you to marry me.

271
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:05,270
I'm sorry, Welford, but...

272
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:08,458
.. my future is here in Liberty Hill.

274
00:23:09,457 --> 00:23:13,874
There is someone else?
There is something else.

275
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:17,792
I, too,
am about to embark on a career.

276
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:22,004
Please wish me success in mine,
as I do you in yours.

277
00:23:22,545 --> 00:23:24,596
I...

278
00:23:24,596 --> 00:23:26,998
Good afternoon, Welford.

279
00:23:42,528 --> 00:23:44,815
It was kind of you to come.

280
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:49,532
I will always be honoured
by your proposal.

286
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:26,443
David said you needed help,
Miss Dove, so I brought Tommy.
I requested young Dr Hurley.

287
00:24:26,443 --> 00:24:31,076
David told us that, but Dr Hurley
is ill with his bronchitis.

288
00:24:31,076 --> 00:24:36,399
The immoderate use of tobacco.
An enslaving habit when formed young.

289
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:39,441
Dr Hurley is out of circulation.

290
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:42,685
I was at Sandy's when David came.

292
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:47,823
Thomas has had excellent training.
I know. It's only that...

293
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:50,848
I see your point, Miss Dove.

294
00:24:50,848 --> 00:24:55,181
To ask for a seasoned medical man
and get me is like...

296
00:24:55,181 --> 00:25:01,014
.. being sent Boy Scouts
when one requested the militia.
Frankly, yes, Thomas.

297
00:25:01,014 --> 00:25:05,977
Since you were kind enough to come,
I shall be glad of your opinion.

298
00:25:05,977 --> 00:25:11,465
My symptoms are a pain at the base
of my spine, sharp and spasmodic,...

299
00:25:11,621 --> 00:25:17,194
..a numbness in my right limb.

301
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:29,442
That so? Was it bad?

302
00:25:29,442 --> 00:25:31,483
Yes.

303
00:25:31,483 --> 00:25:34,275
An absence of sensation in your leg?

304
00:25:34,275 --> 00:25:38,134
My limb has gone to sleep.
As soon as I move...

305
00:25:38,207 --> 00:25:40,723
That's what I can't allow.

307
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,723
Did I understand you to say
"can't allow"?
That's right.

308
00:25:46,723 --> 00:25:48,764
What is your diagnosis?

310
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:56,049
I haven't one yet. We have to
get you to the hospital now.
That is quite unnecessary.
Young Dr Hurley...

312
00:25:56,049 --> 00:26:03,783
.. is flat on his back.
It is quite necessary.
Next week, perhaps.
I cannot be spared. The state...

313
00:26:03,783 --> 00:26:07,826
Not next week, not tomorrow.
Right away, now.

314
00:26:07,826 --> 00:26:10,227
The fifth grade is weak on...

315
00:26:10,316 --> 00:26:14,676
I'm afraid the decision
is not yours, Miss Dove.

316
00:26:15,511 --> 00:26:17,503
Yes, Thomas.

317
00:26:18,793 --> 00:26:23,386
My hat, please. My gloves
and my bag. They are in the closet.

318
00:26:23,386 --> 00:26:25,560
I'll fetch them.

320
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:32,286
I always admired that watch.
Remember?
Perfectly.

321
00:26:50,012 --> 00:26:52,983
I await your convenience, gentlemen.

322
00:26:53,054 --> 00:26:58,541
Now... if you'll just
lean forward...this way.

323
00:26:59,698 --> 00:27:02,351
Support yourself on the desk.

324
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,783
Now, Sandy.

325
00:27:05,702 --> 00:27:09,595
Sit down,
put your arms around our necks...

326
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:14,357
That's right. There we are.

327
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,919
You may go, David.

328
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:24,121
Yes, Miss Dove!

331
00:27:24,513 --> 00:27:31,798
Spine straight. Don't wobble about.
It is not my custom to wobble.
Low bridge. Forward march.

333
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:35,566
David, pick up my things.
Yes, sir.

334
00:27:38,682 --> 00:27:40,686
Watch the steps.

335
00:27:57,454 --> 00:28:02,186
I'm afraid the car might jolt her.
We'll have to carry her.

338
00:28:02,186 --> 00:28:09,550
Can you make it?
I am only three months your senior.
What about Miss Dove?
She must keep her spine rigid.

339
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:14,024
I am neither absent nor deaf.
I am in command of my faculties.

341
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:20,148
I dislike being discussed
in the third person.
Our apologies. Do you object?

342
00:28:20,148 --> 00:28:22,149
I defer to you.

344
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:28,763
You have defined my responsibility.
I shall keep my spine rigid.
Good.

346
00:28:44,252 --> 00:28:47,965
Is she bad off?
It's under control.

348
00:28:47,965 --> 00:28:54,147
Scoot over to the hospital
and tell them I want a private room.
Yes, sir!

351
00:29:36,965 --> 00:29:39,397
As I predicted.

353
00:29:39,397 --> 00:29:45,561
What did you say?
Nothing, Alexander. I am not one
to gloat over an empty triumph.

354
00:29:45,561 --> 00:29:48,373
Spine rigid. We're almost there.

356
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,343
Miss Dove'll be all right.

357
00:30:08,865 --> 00:30:11,266
But it's only frightening.

360
00:30:13,107 --> 00:30:20,112
Regrettable circumstances,
but we are honoured.
Thank you, Mr Fruitt.
I'll get a "special" tonight.

361
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:24,434
A "practical" is all I have now.
Mrs Green's one of our best.

364
00:30:24,434 --> 00:30:29,798
I try to be.
Now what, Thomas?
Mrs Green knows. Keep her quiet.

367
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:37,202
I certainly will, Dr Baker.
I look in on you later, Miss Dove.
We're just gonna relax
and we're gonna have a good time.

369
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:41,926
I'd better get you to your room.
That would seem advisable.

370
00:30:50,341 --> 00:30:54,693
We'll take off our clothes,
then we'll feel more comfy.

371
00:30:54,693 --> 00:31:00,337
The pronoun we is misleading, unless
you plan to take off your clothes.

372
00:31:00,337 --> 00:31:02,018
Oh!

373
00:31:02,018 --> 00:31:05,820
Don't you remember me?
Billie Jean McVeigh.

374
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,462
Yes, Mrs Green, I remember you well.

375
00:31:08,462 --> 00:31:10,674
I'm older now.

376
00:31:10,674 --> 00:31:14,305
If you please,
I am not totally incapacitated.

377
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,367
You are not to exert yourself.

378
00:31:17,518 --> 00:31:22,276
Do you want me to tell Dr Baker
that you are a naughty girl?

379
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:35,318
Something for after the bath to keep
our skin soft... Uh, your skin.

380
00:31:35,318 --> 00:31:37,771
Know what this reminds me of?

383
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:45,496
No, Mrs Green.
The talcum you gave me
for Christmas in third grade.
Second. I gave thimbles in third.

384
00:31:45,496 --> 00:31:50,167
Mine had a picture of lilacs on it.
I was some proud.

385
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:54,821
You said, "This is to use
after you wash your neck. "

386
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:59,744
I intended no reflection upon you.
I say that to all little girls.

387
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:03,496
I didn't take it personal,
but I took it to heart.

388
00:32:03,496 --> 00:32:08,789
I tell my little Ava that.
She's crazy about my Country Garden.

389
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:13,553
If she begs for it, I say,
"First you wash yourself good. "

391
00:32:13,553 --> 00:32:16,555
Well.
Yes, that's what I say.

393
00:32:16,555 --> 00:32:23,919
What is my temperature?
That's confidential.
You wouldn't understand -
it's in centigrade or something.

394
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,482
It is neither in centigrade nor
in something. It is Fahrenheit.

395
00:32:28,482 --> 00:32:31,453
Gee, thanks. I'll remember that.

396
00:32:31,564 --> 00:32:34,046
My question was indiscreet.

397
00:32:34,206 --> 00:32:38,976
Oh, no. All patients are snoopy,
but, you know, rules.

398
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:41,701
Yes, Mrs Green, I know rules.

399
00:32:41,771 --> 00:32:46,142
I'll stop yakking
so you can take a nice little nap.

400
00:32:54,378 --> 00:33:01,903
That Country Garden perfume,
a gentlemen friend I was seeing
until a month ago gave it to me.

401
00:33:01,903 --> 00:33:04,794
He said it smelled real refined.

402
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:10,717
I was happy in his company. Seemed
mutual but it came to a dead end.

403
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:15,672
I've been a widow for
five lonely years, as you've heard.

405
00:33:15,672 --> 00:33:21,318
I do not recall...
Remember when I went to Detroit
to work in factory?

406
00:33:21,475 --> 00:33:26,558
Out there, I met Mr Green.
He passed away... shortly after.

408
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:31,361
Hmm...
When I spoke of being older,
you see what I mean.

409
00:33:31,361 --> 00:33:36,097
Your life must be full.
You have your work and your child.

410
00:33:36,254 --> 00:33:38,292
Yeah.

411
00:33:38,446 --> 00:33:44,103
You know Bill Holloway.
Officer Holloway, I should say.

412
00:33:44,209 --> 00:33:46,851
William was one of my pupils.

413
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:50,783
I thought you might like to know
how he admires you.

414
00:33:50,783 --> 00:33:53,743
You're his idea of real genteel.

415
00:33:53,855 --> 00:33:56,257
I value William's opinion.

416
00:33:56,377 --> 00:33:59,507
Funny how he ended
up the type he is.

418
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:04,072
Why do you say that?
Thinking about how he started out.

419
00:34:04,072 --> 00:34:10,586
Raised by his old grandmother
- you know what she was -
in a leaky shack by the gasworks.

420
00:34:10,586 --> 00:34:17,110
William started out with a gift
rarer than mathematical genius
or perfect pitch.

421
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:22,437
A child in whom the ethical instinct
was as innate as breathing.

422
00:34:23,314 --> 00:34:29,157
Anyone who'd tell him that could
drive a truck between his ears!

423
00:34:29,157 --> 00:34:32,094
There is no point in apprising him.

424
00:34:32,209 --> 00:34:35,408
He knows what he is. He always knew.

428
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:58,095
The last desk in the third row.
Thank you.

429
00:34:58,772 --> 00:35:01,825
Good morning. Our little Jackie.

432
00:35:01,825 --> 00:35:06,828
Good morning, Jacqueline.
I wanna go home!
Her daddy all over again!

434
00:35:06,828 --> 00:35:15,195
S-W-E-E-T when she wants to be,
B-A-D when she doesn't.
I will conduct you to your desk.
Good morning, Mrs Wood.

435
00:35:16,675 --> 00:35:20,517
Well, Miss Dove,
if at first we don't succeed...

436
00:35:20,517 --> 00:35:22,578
Good morning, Frederick.

439
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:30,163
Where'd they come from?
Pepperdine's Market.
But we weren't in... He picked
them up as we passed - for you.

440
00:35:30,163 --> 00:35:32,451
I'll pay on the way back.

441
00:35:32,605 --> 00:35:37,368
Thank you, but do not
make a habit of bringing me gifts.

442
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:41,090
Miss Dove doesn't want
any more apples

443
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,853
You may take your desk from last year

444
00:35:43,932 --> 00:35:49,623
It isn't that he's backward, but
give him your special attention.

445
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:53,862
All my pupils
receive my special attention.

446
00:35:55,659 --> 00:36:01,102
Is that child entering Cedar Grove?
Keep Freddie away from him.

448
00:36:01,102 --> 00:36:08,467
Oh, I believe in democracy, but
I don't want him to catch anything.
Seating arrangements are alphabetical

450
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:14,671
But it's that Holloway child!
You know his background.
His grandmother...

451
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:20,078
I am not interested in my pupils'
backgrounds, only in their character.

452
00:36:20,915 --> 00:36:23,373
Good morning, I am Miss Dove.

453
00:36:23,486 --> 00:36:28,719
I know your last name is Holloway,
but I do not know your first name.

454
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,321
It's Bill. Can I come to school?

455
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:33,609
Most certainly, William.

456
00:36:37,535 --> 00:36:39,527
This is your desk.

457
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:46,290
Good morning.

458
00:36:53,975 --> 00:36:56,548
Ain't that coffee done, Billy?

459
00:36:56,577 --> 00:36:59,582
I'm getting it for you now, Grandma.

460
00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:04,509
It'll be a cold day when Kelly's
cheap joint sees me again!

461
00:37:04,742 --> 00:37:10,194
Insulting me in public just because
I owe him a few lousy bucks.

462
00:37:10,946 --> 00:37:16,229
Then threatening to call the cops
because I gve him a piece of my mind.

463
00:37:16,229 --> 00:37:20,931
 I bet you could hear me
in the next county!

465
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:27,246
Where'd you get that?
Mrs Schultz paid me for an errand.

466
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:31,318
Ain't she got a nerve,
considering we don't speak?!

468
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:34,851
Goodbye, Grandma.
Where you rushing to?

469
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:41,181
If you can run errands
for old lady Schultz,
you can do a nice little job for me.

471
00:37:41,255 --> 00:37:48,586
No, I'll be late.
Don't stir. Take them beer bottles
in the yard and dump them.

472
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:54,711
This is the day that nosy dame from
the relief comes snooping around.

475
00:38:12,664 --> 00:38:16,318
Good morning, Miss Dove.
Good morning, William.

477
00:38:23,121 --> 00:38:26,171
Attention, please.

478
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,729
Your lunch, William.

480
00:38:40,446 --> 00:38:44,613
Thank you, Miss Dove.
Drink all your milk, William.

481
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:51,984
Your work is most satisfactory.

482
00:38:55,055 --> 00:38:57,105
William Holloway!

483
00:38:59,698 --> 00:39:05,342
Your certificate of graduation...
and the Good Attendance Medal.

484
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:10,105
This young man has a record unique
in the annals of Cedar Grove.

485
00:39:10,105 --> 00:39:15,592
He has not been absent one day in
six years of elementary schooling.

486
00:39:27,435 --> 00:39:29,837
My felicitations, William.

487
00:39:32,238 --> 00:39:36,001
I came to thank you
for my graduation suit.

488
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:38,414
It was my pleasure.

489
00:39:39,843 --> 00:39:42,734
Well, I guess I better be going.

490
00:39:43,566 --> 00:39:48,450
I shall watch where you go
with interest. I have faith in you.

491
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,907
It was always so clean in here.

492
00:39:53,572 --> 00:39:56,975
Like this was where I really lived.

493
00:39:59,706 --> 00:40:02,221
That's why I never missed a day.

494
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,751
Goodbye, Miss Dove.

495
00:40:10,022 --> 00:40:12,071
Goodbye, William.

496
00:40:18,107 --> 00:40:22,079
'I do not worry about him.
He will find his way. '

497
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:39,407
Poor Annie. Wonder if she ever knew
it was a beer truck that hit her.

498
00:40:48,536 --> 00:40:50,539
William...

499
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,588
May I offer
my expressions of sympathy?

500
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,063
Thank you, Miss Dove.

501
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:02,066
She did the best she could.

502
00:41:04,466 --> 00:41:07,346
She didn't have my opportunities.

503
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:10,072
Her troubles are over.

504
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,781
Will you be riding with me?

505
00:41:12,781 --> 00:41:12,781
Yeah.

506
00:41:12,781 --> 00:41:18,074
Yeah.
I should like to accompany you,
if you wish.

507
00:41:18,074 --> 00:41:20,077
Thank you, Miss Dove.

508
00:41:37,606 --> 00:41:41,500
'"William Holloway,
Private First Class". '

509
00:41:49,844 --> 00:41:52,906
"Corporal William Holloway". Hmm. '

510
00:42:02,462 --> 00:42:05,547
Hmm! Sergeant William Holloway.

511
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:08,273
Thank you, Mr O'Neil.

512
00:42:19,312 --> 00:42:24,355
These sure are... They're delicious,
Miss Dove. What's in them?

514
00:42:24,355 --> 00:42:30,159
Only bread and butter, William.
When did you return?
On the 3.45.

515
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:37,363
I made a beeline straight from
the station to see you.

518
00:42:37,363 --> 00:42:43,647
I need your advice.
I am honoured.
Tomorrow, I'm out of the Marines.

519
00:42:43,888 --> 00:42:50,932
What if I use my GI educational
allowance for living expenses
and finished school?

521
00:42:50,932 --> 00:42:57,296
I should approve.
And then what, William?
This'll throw you... surprise you.

522
00:42:57,376 --> 00:42:59,947
The field of law enforcement -

523
00:42:59,947 --> 00:43:04,140
.. I'd like to be a good cop,
I mean, police officer.

524
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:09,787
A worthy ambition. I shall continue
to follow your career with interest.

525
00:43:11,024 --> 00:43:13,074
Thank you, Miss Dove.

527
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:22,888
Miss Dove... Miss Dove?

528
00:43:23,312 --> 00:43:25,839
Here's Dr Temple, Miss Dove.

529
00:43:26,034 --> 00:43:28,605
I'm Dr Baker's house officer.

531
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:34,729
You may report to Dr Baker
that I'm comfortable.
Good. That makes my task easier.

534
00:43:34,729 --> 00:43:39,282
Your task?
I'm to take your history.
I'll wait in the hall.

536
00:43:39,282 --> 00:43:42,934
That will be quite unnecessary.
Oh, it's custom.

537
00:43:42,934 --> 00:43:48,087
We have your childhood records
so we can get down to the immediate.

541
00:43:48,087 --> 00:43:56,353
Do you suffer from headaches?
No, Dr Temple.
Respiratory infections?
No. Nor am I prone to common colds.

543
00:43:56,423 --> 00:44:00,655
Any allergies?
None. I consider them affectations.

545
00:44:00,655 --> 00:44:07,139
Any family history of epilepsy,
night blindness or melancholy?
Certainly not.

546
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:10,121
What about your emotional life?

547
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,433
I beg your pardon?

548
00:44:12,433 --> 00:44:17,155
Well,... Iove. Any feelings of
frustration, inadequacy?

549
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:19,717
I have never felt inadequate.

550
00:44:19,717 --> 00:44:24,120
Suppose we call your emotional life
satisfactory?

552
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,802
That will be correct.
Are you subject to fantasy?

553
00:44:27,802 --> 00:44:32,645
Does the world around you
ever assume an aura of unreality?

555
00:44:32,645 --> 00:44:37,038
Yes, Dr Temple.
Could you say approximately when?

556
00:44:37,038 --> 00:44:41,215
I can say definitely.
Since around noon today.

557
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:43,529
Oh...

558
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:45,973
Thank you, Miss Dove.

559
00:44:45,973 --> 00:44:48,739
Dr Baker will be in later,
of course.

560
00:44:50,446 --> 00:44:55,459
We're really old friends.
I feel I've known you all my life.

563
00:44:55,459 --> 00:45:03,508
You've known me?
I'm Adams Temple.
My mother was a Liberty Hill girl.
Angela Adams. I should have known.

564
00:45:03,624 --> 00:45:09,308
Mother moved to Maine when
she was 14, but she remembers you.

565
00:45:09,308 --> 00:45:13,430
I remember her.
She, too, had an enquiring mind.

566
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:21,315
Still has. She boasts that she's
the only kid who ever asked you
a question you couldn't answer.

568
00:45:21,315 --> 00:45:26,358
Indeed?
She says it was
in first or second grade.

569
00:45:26,358 --> 00:45:29,280
You were reading a book on animals.

570
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,324
It said bears were fond of red ants,
which taste similar to pickles.

571
00:45:35,324 --> 00:45:40,257
Mother asked you how the man who
wrote the book knew how ants tasted.

572
00:45:40,257 --> 00:45:44,089
Did he eat an ant
or did a bear tell him?

574
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:50,053
I recall the incident.
I'm writing her tonight.
She'll get a wallop out of this.

575
00:45:50,053 --> 00:45:53,665
If there's anything I can do,
just buzz.

578
00:45:53,665 --> 00:45:59,739
One moment, Dr Temple.
You want Dr Temple?
Yes. To ask him a few questions.

579
00:45:59,739 --> 00:46:03,461
He told me nothing
of my physical condition.

580
00:46:03,461 --> 00:46:07,064
He couldn't.
You're Dr Baker's patient.

581
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:10,746
Then what is it
that Dr Baker suspects?

582
00:46:10,746 --> 00:46:12,749
He'll tell you.

584
00:46:12,827 --> 00:46:18,351
I see no occasion for mystery.
Don't try to see.
Let us do the thinking.

585
00:46:18,351 --> 00:46:24,281
You, Thomas Baker and Angela Adams's
son will think for me?

586
00:46:24,635 --> 00:46:29,087
Sure. We're experienced.
Oh, look. Your first flowers.

587
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:33,160
Bill... Officer Holloway
left it at the desk.

589
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,859
It is beautiful.

591
00:46:38,363 --> 00:46:45,297
Good afternoon, Virginia.
I didn't know you'd been admitted.
I haven't. I came to see you.
How are you?

592
00:46:45,297 --> 00:46:47,449
Comfortable. And you?

593
00:46:47,529 --> 00:46:49,980
The suspense is killing me.

594
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:55,734
If nothing's happened by this week,
Dr Tillet's giving Nature a nudge.

595
00:46:55,734 --> 00:47:01,858
He says keep walking - I'd better.
If Tommy knew I was here
he'd have a fit.

597
00:47:01,858 --> 00:47:01,858
I just came to wish you good luck.
And to you, Virginia.

598
00:47:01,858 --> 00:47:08,062
I just came to wish you good luck.
And to you, Virginia.
Thank you.

599
00:47:09,222 --> 00:47:12,154
I'll keep my fingers crossed for us.

601
00:47:12,154 --> 00:47:16,548
I know you'll take care of her.
I sure will.

602
00:47:16,627 --> 00:47:21,280
I used to think she was
the snootiest, dumbest brat here.

603
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,431
She's really a good kid.

604
00:47:23,431 --> 00:47:27,924
In marriage and maternity,
she has found her vocation,...

605
00:47:27,924 --> 00:47:30,075
.. achieved her destiny.

606
00:47:31,166 --> 00:47:34,808
'A year ago,
I was not quite so hopeful. '

608
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:44,244
~ Dear old Cedar Grove, to thee

609
00:47:44,604 --> 00:47:50,729
~ We pledge our love and loyalty

610
00:47:51,328 --> 00:47:57,111
~ And though peril may beset us

611
00:47:57,502 --> 00:48:04,266
~ On life's tempestuous sea

612
00:48:04,266 --> 00:48:09,950
~ Your spirit still will guide us

613
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:20,845
~ To shore and victory. ~

614
00:48:29,922 --> 00:48:35,455
It seems only yesterday we marched
down that aisle. You too, Jincey.

615
00:48:38,608 --> 00:48:40,611
Come on.

617
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:55,757
The final innings.

618
00:48:55,819 --> 00:49:01,601
Let's not be downhearted. There's
always new rookies coming up to bat.

619
00:49:15,746 --> 00:49:19,658
'For six years,
I pruned and polished them. '

620
00:49:19,658 --> 00:49:25,482
'I tried to blow into them the breath
of purpose. I do not wish them back. '

621
00:49:25,482 --> 00:49:30,167
'I wish only to believe that
they will do well without me. '

624
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,491
Good morning, Miss Dove.
Good morning, Virginia.

625
00:49:41,924 --> 00:49:44,015
This was my place.

626
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:46,611
You may sit there now, Virginia.

627
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:50,382
The room is different.

628
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,829
Empty...

629
00:49:52,981 --> 00:49:55,018
Like life.

630
00:49:55,733 --> 00:49:59,625
Is that the same map?
Is China still orange?

631
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:04,759
It is a new map. China is purple -
cartographically, of course.

632
00:50:04,828 --> 00:50:08,665
I liked the old map.
I liked the old world.

633
00:50:11,022 --> 00:50:13,322
I felt secure in this room.

634
00:50:13,434 --> 00:50:22,006
I felt that if I obeyed the law,
sneezed in my handkerchief, raised
my hand for permission to speak...

635
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,769
..that that was my oyster,
that nothing could go wrong.

636
00:50:28,203 --> 00:50:33,815
At first it worked. Even flunking
out of university seemed like fate.

637
00:50:33,926 --> 00:50:39,618
I won that talent contest and got a
job in New York singing commercials.

638
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:43,933
Oh, Miss Dove, tell me what to do.

640
00:50:43,933 --> 00:50:48,175
Do your duty.
How, when your world has ended?

642
00:50:48,175 --> 00:50:52,368
You are 19.
What difference does that make?

643
00:50:52,368 --> 00:50:54,699
You need to know how it was.

644
00:50:54,699 --> 00:50:59,052
I met him at the Stork Club,
I'd been in New York a week.

645
00:50:59,052 --> 00:51:01,614
He spoke to the waiter in French.

646
00:51:02,704 --> 00:51:07,787
He was everything that the papers
said he was when we were engaged.

647
00:51:07,787 --> 00:51:11,874
Yale, a yacht,
and the skyon of a prominent family.

648
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:15,592
The word is scion. The "c" is silent.

649
00:51:15,592 --> 00:51:21,125
Well, he looked like what he was.
Most sky... scions don't.

650
00:51:21,276 --> 00:51:26,479
Every night it was the Stork Club
and El Morocco and Twenty-One.

651
00:51:26,479 --> 00:51:32,043
Champagne and steaks.
Did you ever drink champagne?

652
00:51:32,043 --> 00:51:32,043
No.

653
00:51:32,043 --> 00:51:36,685
No.
It's like cider,
but the effect is different.

654
00:51:36,685 --> 00:51:41,250
And the compliments he paid my hair,
my eyes and my figure.

655
00:51:41,488 --> 00:51:44,290
I'm embarrassed to repeat them.

656
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:48,992
Reticence, Virginia,
is the sine qua non of gentility.

657
00:51:49,103 --> 00:51:54,625
Anyhow, I came home to Liberty Hill
to prepare for my wedding.

658
00:51:55,337 --> 00:51:59,948
I wanted to be married here
so all my friends could come.

659
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:05,874
I was modelling my wedding dress
when someone turned on the radio...

660
00:52:05,944 --> 00:52:08,789
.. and then everything went black!

662
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:23,765
The next day I got a telegram -
"Gorgeous, only you can understand".

663
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,796
Could you?

664
00:52:25,796 --> 00:52:28,403
No. I still can't! Can you?

665
00:52:28,558 --> 00:52:32,576
Certainly.
Have you a handkerchief, Virginia?

667
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:40,489
My heart's broken, Miss Dove.

668
00:52:40,725 --> 00:52:43,616
A broken heart is cumbersome baggage.

669
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:46,059
What can I do?

670
00:52:46,059 --> 00:52:52,823
I am not undecided as to how you
should be answered, but I am not
convinced this is my province.

671
00:52:52,823 --> 00:52:55,099
Oh, tell me, Miss Dove.

672
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:59,547
Very well. First,
return to your sister's house,...

673
00:52:59,547 --> 00:53:03,820
..fall on your knees and give thanks
to your Heavenly Father.

675
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:09,143
For what?
Preserving you from
a fate worse than death.

676
00:53:09,143 --> 00:53:16,988
Evidently, the young man to whom
you gave your affections discovered
his feelings for you had altered.

677
00:53:16,988 --> 00:53:19,920
He had an honourable avenue of escape

678
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,712
He could have requested you
to release him.

679
00:53:23,712 --> 00:53:29,044
Instead, he proved himself a coward
and a person of low principles.

681
00:53:29,044 --> 00:53:37,297
I thought there was
something wrong with me.
Your fault lay in rashness
of judgement. His lay in dishonour.

682
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:43,213
After thanking the Power that kept
you from a disastrous alliance,...

683
00:53:43,213 --> 00:53:49,217
.. consider your duty to
your neighbour and yourself.
Find an occupation.

685
00:53:49,217 --> 00:53:54,660
Do you think I could teach?
Decidedly not,
but there are other ways to serve.

686
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:56,741
I might be a nurse.

687
00:53:56,741 --> 00:53:58,791
You might.

689
00:54:00,093 --> 00:54:03,786
Good morning, Miss Dove.
Good morning, Thomas.

690
00:54:03,786 --> 00:54:06,027
I thought I'd drop by.

691
00:54:06,027 --> 00:54:11,190
Jincey, I didn't expect to find you
here. Holy mackerel, you're grown!

692
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:13,792
You've done a mighty neat job of it.

693
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,833
Thank you.

694
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:21,117
The last time I saw her was before
med school, she was graduating.

697
00:54:21,117 --> 00:54:29,530
She shot my brother
with a squirt gun in the...
Virginia cannot enjoy being reminded.
It's cute of Tommy to remember.

699
00:54:29,682 --> 00:54:34,167
Does this room look different?
Yes. Considerably.

700
00:54:34,685 --> 00:54:37,767
The hospital must keep you busy.

701
00:54:37,767 --> 00:54:42,370
It calls me now. My car's outside
if I can take you someplace?

702
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:46,732
Oh, wonderful!
Goodbye, Miss Dove, and thank you.

703
00:54:46,732 --> 00:54:51,335
I'll think about my nursing career.
Maybe Tommy can advise me.

704
00:54:51,335 --> 00:54:54,067
I'll advise her very carefully.

705
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,261
'I am 54. '

706
00:55:00,261 --> 00:55:03,266
'I won't have to retire until 67. '

707
00:55:03,873 --> 00:55:08,906
'If they don't tarry, and from
all indications they won't,...

708
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:13,989
.. I could take their first child
straight through to graduation. '

709
00:55:13,989 --> 00:55:16,191
'That child will need me. '

711
00:55:28,198 --> 00:55:30,640
Oh, I'd better get you ready.

713
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:35,603
For what?
For night duty -
you have a special ordered.

714
00:55:35,603 --> 00:55:40,536
Those dames love to throw their
weight around with us practicals.

715
00:55:40,536 --> 00:55:44,531
The least thing
and they squawk downstairs.

716
00:55:45,459 --> 00:55:48,259
A small town is not my cup of tea.

717
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:52,824
But my sister lives here
and I needed a rest.

718
00:55:52,824 --> 00:55:57,216
I only took your case
as a favour to the superintendent.

719
00:55:57,216 --> 00:56:00,312
I'm interested in nursing theory.

720
00:56:00,468 --> 00:56:05,352
My training is wasted on
the daily routine of the bedside.

721
00:56:11,825 --> 00:56:13,920
Not very uplifting,...

722
00:56:14,117 --> 00:56:19,274
.. but Mrs Green thought when you
woke up you might want to read.

723
00:56:20,241 --> 00:56:23,131
Everybody to his own taste.

724
00:56:23,362 --> 00:56:29,646
Can you think of
an eight-letter word
meaning a rare, endearing quality?

725
00:56:29,646 --> 00:56:31,798
I can. Humility.

726
00:56:32,238 --> 00:56:34,449
Let's see. H-U...

727
00:56:34,449 --> 00:56:36,612
You're 100% right!

728
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:39,328
She always is.

729
00:56:40,003 --> 00:56:44,466
The latest operating wear.
Did you think I'd forgotten you?

730
00:56:44,536 --> 00:56:46,607
No, Thomas.

731
00:56:46,607 --> 00:56:51,380
I dropped by to see you're being
well-treated. Any complaints?

732
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:57,103
I am not pleased with this secrecy.
I should like to ask some questions.

733
00:56:57,103 --> 00:57:00,385
I'm not sure I can answer them.

735
00:57:00,385 --> 00:57:05,989
What do you surmise?
I don't "surmise".
Tomorrow we'll do extensive tests.

736
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:08,994
By Wednesday I should know more.

737
00:57:09,151 --> 00:57:13,557
Until then, you must assume
the virtue of docility.

738
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,279
Yes, Thomas.

739
00:57:26,222 --> 00:57:31,255
We're all sorry Miss Dove is in the
hospital, but we won't let her down.

740
00:57:31,255 --> 00:57:35,377
We'll go on with our geography.
I will take her place.

743
00:57:39,069 --> 00:57:43,062
Our quarterback was injured
so I'll sub for her.

744
00:57:43,062 --> 00:57:45,634
I'll call the plays she'd call.

745
00:57:45,634 --> 00:57:51,027
I don't know these plays like you
so when I'm offsides, let me know.

746
00:57:51,027 --> 00:57:51,027
 OK!

747
00:57:51,027 --> 00:57:51,027
 OK!
We're all pitching together.

748
00:57:51,027 --> 00:57:56,400
 OK!
We're all pitching together.
 Yes!

751
00:58:08,808 --> 00:58:13,001
Nice of you to drop in -
I was only admitted two hours ago!

753
00:58:13,001 --> 00:58:17,613
I know, but I've been pretty busy.
Don't let me detain you!

754
00:58:17,613 --> 00:58:20,415
My physician will keep you informed.

756
00:58:20,415 --> 00:58:26,769
I know, that's why
I can put you out of my mind.
Tommy Baker, of all the callous...

757
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:31,622
Have you forgotten that I'm here
to have a baby? Our first baby!

758
00:58:31,622 --> 00:58:34,664
I've thought of it all morning -

759
00:58:34,664 --> 00:58:39,387
.. I'm the luckiest guy in the world
but by what a narrow squeak -

761
00:58:39,387 --> 00:58:39,387
and how much she had to do with it.
Who?

762
00:58:39,387 --> 00:58:44,874
and how much she had to do with it.
Who?
The Terrible Miss Dove.

763
00:58:45,431 --> 00:58:50,394
Without her, there'd have been
no Thomas Baker and family.

764
00:58:50,474 --> 00:58:53,479
What did she have to do with it?

765
00:58:55,317 --> 00:58:59,439
In the South Pacific,
after my ship was bombed,...

766
00:58:59,439 --> 00:59:03,482
.. I floated for days on a raft.
No food. No water.

767
00:59:03,482 --> 00:59:06,324
She was there with me all the time.

768
00:59:06,324 --> 00:59:11,727
Giving me the same fishy stare she
gave me in class when I needed water

769
00:59:11,727 --> 00:59:16,370
To make my supply last,
I pretended I was in Cedar Grove.

770
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:24,737
When the water was gone, I'd think,
"The bell will ring soon.
You can last a little longer. "

771
00:59:27,937 --> 00:59:32,263
Well, I lasted. They picked me up
and gave me a medal.

772
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:34,702
She rated that medal.

773
00:59:35,342 --> 00:59:39,553
Is anything awful
the matter with Miss Dove?

774
00:59:39,905 --> 00:59:44,958
I'm due back now for more tests.
We won't know till tomorrow.

775
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:50,354
Don't worry about me, Tommy.
I'll look after Little Whosit.

776
01:00:23,332 --> 01:00:27,714
Tomorrow we'll talk.
Put all this out of your mind.

778
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:31,945
Thomas...
Now, we mustn't worry about tomorrow

779
01:00:32,097 --> 01:00:35,591
Goodness, it's a regular greenhouse.

780
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:41,757
I am deeply appreciative,
but there are far too many.

781
01:00:42,353 --> 01:00:45,951
Restraint is
the better part of beauty.

782
01:00:46,356 --> 01:00:50,716
I will keep the white azalea.
Dispose of the others.

783
01:00:50,869 --> 01:00:53,327
But what'll I do with them?

785
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:53,800
The less fortunate patients
would enjoy them.
Shall I take them around the wards?

786
01:00:53,800 --> 01:01:01,576
The less fortunate patients
would enjoy them.
Shall I take them around the wards?
Please do.

787
01:01:03,567 --> 01:01:08,530
I went up and down the halls
giving cheer where it was needed.

788
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:13,883
I saved the cards. If you'd like me
to write the thank-you notes...

789
01:01:13,883 --> 01:01:15,974
That would be obliging.

791
01:01:15,974 --> 01:01:22,383
Will you dictate?
No, use your own discretion.
Only avoid the fulsome.

792
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:28,233
I was gonna say the same thing
to everyone. What do you think...?

793
01:01:28,902 --> 01:01:31,907
 "Dear Mr Porter,...

794
01:01:32,344 --> 01:01:36,397
"..At the request of Miss Dove,...

795
01:01:37,067 --> 01:01:44,240
".. I am advising you...
that she is thrilled to death...

796
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:49,238
".. by your florial offering. "

797
01:01:51,076 --> 01:01:54,878
"The sympathy of friends...

798
01:01:55,269 --> 01:02:01,086
".. brings sunshine
to lonely shut-ins. "

799
01:02:01,923 --> 01:02:05,929
"I remain graciously yours,...

800
01:02:06,325 --> 01:02:11,892
".. Billie Jean Green, RPN. "

801
01:02:15,971 --> 01:02:19,334
What does RPN stand for?

802
01:02:19,334 --> 01:02:24,980
Registered Practical Nurse -
I made that up. How's the letter?

803
01:02:25,297 --> 01:02:28,621
It is very...very genteel.

804
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:33,310
Oh, gee! Honest, Miss Dove?

805
01:02:40,347 --> 01:02:44,922
You know, Miss Dove,
I'm not really Mrs Green.

806
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,954
I took the name for Ava's sake.

807
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:52,410
I was way out there in Detroit.

808
01:02:52,604 --> 01:02:55,166
Virtue knows no frontiers.

809
01:02:55,516 --> 01:03:00,377
I was on the night shift.
I'd never been anywhere before.

810
01:03:00,479 --> 01:03:04,322
You remember how
I wasn't very mature.

811
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:08,324
All the fellows wanted to date me.
It went to my head.

812
01:03:08,324 --> 01:03:13,217
There was one - I didn't know
he was married - he was wonderful.

813
01:03:13,217 --> 01:03:15,248
Before I knew it...

814
01:03:15,248 --> 01:03:17,650
There is no need to elaborate.

815
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:22,067
He was good-looking and big,
and I was so homesick.

817
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:25,895
You know how it is.
I do not.

818
01:03:25,895 --> 01:03:30,061
But I know that right is right
and wrong is wrong.

819
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:39,304
Well, to make a long story short,
little Ava came...

820
01:03:40,354 --> 01:03:42,795
..way out there in Detroit.

821
01:03:42,795 --> 01:03:47,964
I could have given her up for
adoption, a couple offered $4,000,..

822
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,128
.. but, well,...

823
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,517
..she was mine.

824
01:03:52,832 --> 01:03:57,568
Besides, how did I know
strangers would raise her right?

825
01:03:58,755 --> 01:04:04,857
Anyway, I brought her home and told
that tale about my husband dying.

826
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,373
Why did you confide in me?

827
01:04:08,651 --> 01:04:12,414
Because of what you said
about the letter.

828
01:04:12,414 --> 01:04:16,056
I'm not nearly as genteel
as you think.

829
01:04:16,056 --> 01:04:18,947
I couldn't deceive you or Bill.

831
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:25,951
William Holloway?
He was the one who gave me
the Country Garden perfume.

832
01:04:27,333 --> 01:04:30,350
You and... and William Holloway?

833
01:04:31,506 --> 01:04:36,310
When he bought me an engagement
ring, it just all came out.

834
01:04:37,229 --> 01:04:41,202
He's like you,
a person you tell the truth to.

835
01:04:42,262 --> 01:04:45,279
That's what stopped me just then.

836
01:04:45,835 --> 01:04:48,122
He said your very words.

837
01:04:49,107 --> 01:04:51,884
"Right is right. Wrong is wrong. "

838
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:56,722
He wanted me
to keep the ring... as a gift.

839
01:04:57,522 --> 01:04:59,603
I handed it right back.

840
01:04:59,603 --> 01:05:03,679
Let him keep it
for somebody more...fitting.

841
01:05:08,609 --> 01:05:13,254
Well, it knocked me for a loop
I won't ever recover from.

842
01:05:14,933 --> 01:05:19,497
I guess I'm one of those
that have to learn the hard way.

843
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,952
Just about time for Her Nibs...

844
01:05:29,542 --> 01:05:31,955
Your special, I meant to say.

847
01:05:54,757 --> 01:05:58,400
From the third grade.
It's Cedar Grove!

848
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:02,402
The work is laudably neat.
Place it on the dresser.

850
01:06:02,402 --> 01:06:05,964
Isn't it sweet?
When may we expect Dr Baker?

852
01:06:05,964 --> 01:06:05,964
Now, we're not to worry.
No news is good news.

853
01:06:05,964 --> 01:06:12,294
Now, we're not to worry.
No news is good news.

854
01:06:13,859 --> 01:06:16,659
Miss Dove's room,
Mrs Green speaking.

855
01:06:16,771 --> 01:06:20,053
Who? I will enquire.

856
01:06:20,053 --> 01:06:26,697
Two out-of-towners would
like to visit - one telephoned,
the other's in the lobby.

858
01:06:26,697 --> 01:06:32,501
Who are they?
One is Mr Maurice Levine,
the famous New York playwright.

860
01:06:32,501 --> 01:06:41,517
The other is Fred Makepeace.
I suppose you know where he resides.
They are former pupils.
I shall be glad to see them both.

861
01:06:41,636 --> 01:06:44,238
Miss Dove will see them. Both.

862
01:06:44,238 --> 01:06:46,230
What? Hmm!

863
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:51,833
Mr Makepeace was so sure of
his welcome he's on his way up.

864
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:56,535
I don't hold with giving a dog
a bad name, but I take no chances.

866
01:06:59,966 --> 01:07:01,423
Morning, Miss Dove! How ya doin'?

867
01:07:07,853 --> 01:07:11,655
I'm not over the hill,
on the lam, or anything.

868
01:07:11,655 --> 01:07:15,978
When I read you were sick,
I said to my gang boss,

869
01:07:15,978 --> 01:07:21,571
"The only teacher that learned me
anything is sick. I want a day off. "

871
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:27,215
And he gave you leave?
"Why sure, Fred, " he says,
"I can trust you. "

873
01:07:27,215 --> 01:07:31,187
I am gratified to hear that.

876
01:07:32,788 --> 01:07:37,951
Maurice Levine.
Come right in.
How are you, darl... Miss Dove?

880
01:07:37,951 --> 01:07:44,646
Quite comfortable, Maurice.
These are for you.
How very thoughtful.
Recall the face, Rab?

881
01:07:44,716 --> 01:07:46,957
Fred Makepeace!

882
01:07:46,957 --> 01:07:54,922
Your fan, kid! Do I swell up when
I hear you mentioned by Ed Sullivan
and read it in all them papers!

884
01:07:54,922 --> 01:07:58,884
Thanks, Fred.
I lay it on with guys at the joint.

885
01:07:58,884 --> 01:08:03,848
You made it. When I hear some commie
jerk belittling this country,...

886
01:08:03,848 --> 01:08:10,972
.. I say, "Look up my pal Rab Levine.
Ask him if the USA isn't still
the land of opportunity! "

887
01:08:10,972 --> 01:08:15,935
The best. But I also found
the Terrible Miss Dove.

889
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:26,382
Miss Dove, this is Maurice Levine.

891
01:08:26,382 --> 01:08:34,627
I am glad to know you, Maurice.
He's 11. His credentials
from school in Poland
would place him in 5th grade.

892
01:08:34,627 --> 01:08:39,431
But he knows no English,
so I'll place him in first for now.

893
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:42,636
I shall seat him in the L-section.

894
01:08:52,448 --> 01:08:54,440
Thank you, Miss Dove.

895
01:08:58,281 --> 01:09:00,376
The class will begin.

896
01:09:04,405 --> 01:09:09,893
"The tiger belongs to the cat family.
Cats are noted for cleanliness. "

897
01:09:11,289 --> 01:09:13,350
Maurice,...

898
01:09:13,781 --> 01:09:15,932
..this is a tiger.

899
01:09:16,052 --> 01:09:21,312
T-I-G-E-R.

902
01:09:35,795 --> 01:09:38,789
.. punct wie mein mama's alte katz.

903
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:43,850
Thank you, Maurice.
I am sure that was most interesting.

904
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:49,648
When Maurice knows our language
we will ask him to repeat it.

905
01:09:49,923 --> 01:09:56,568
POLISH ACCENT
"Old Mrs Rabbit vas a vidow. She
made a living by knitting mittens. "

906
01:09:56,568 --> 01:10:03,694
"She also sold herbs and
rosemary tea and rabbit tobacco,
vich we call lavender. "

907
01:10:04,813 --> 01:10:09,616
"Ven no one vas looking,
she would smoke a rabbit cigar. "

908
01:10:09,616 --> 01:10:14,489
I have no recollection of Mrs Rabbit
indulging in any such vice.

910
01:10:14,489 --> 01:10:19,031
Is that on the page?
No, but it seemed funny to me.

911
01:10:19,102 --> 01:10:21,742
Adhere to the text. Continue.

912
01:10:21,773 --> 01:10:26,827
Yes, Miss Dove. "She had
four children - Flopsy, Mopsy,... "

913
01:10:29,018 --> 01:10:31,317
Here comes that new kid!

914
01:10:34,031 --> 01:10:38,514
Sicki wizicki boo!
Sicki wizicki boo! Come on, gang!

915
01:10:38,514 --> 01:10:41,756
Fred! Tom... What's up, Tommy?

917
01:10:41,756 --> 01:10:46,639
Let him alone. He didn't do nothing.
Come on, it's just for the ducks.

918
01:10:46,639 --> 01:10:48,926
Sicki wizicki boo!

921
01:10:53,243 --> 01:10:56,453
Good morning, boys.
Good morning, Miss Dove.

922
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:06,618
Good morning, Maurice.

923
01:11:07,332 --> 01:11:09,574
Good morning, Miss Dove.

924
01:11:09,693 --> 01:11:12,539
I am slightly encumbered
this morning.

925
01:11:12,615 --> 01:11:15,346
Would you mind carrying my books?

927
01:11:30,506 --> 01:11:34,912
ALL Good morning, Miss Dove.
Good morning, boys.

928
01:11:39,842 --> 01:11:46,729
In this season, people consider
the country of Palestine -
the original home of the Jews -

929
01:11:47,046 --> 01:11:53,410
..a country we hear much about
in church, but of whose children
we know very little.

930
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:57,443
To study a people
and their customs is valuable.

931
01:11:57,443 --> 01:12:04,083
But to know a people and their ways
is a privilege seldom attained,
without the luxury of travel.

932
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:06,894
The fifth grade is rarely privileged.

933
01:12:07,575 --> 01:12:11,928
Your parents permit me to take you
to a traditional Jewish feast.

935
01:12:11,928 --> 01:12:17,699
Mr and Mrs Levine
have graciously invited you.

937
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:25,422
We're going to Rab Levine's house?
We are visiting Maurice's parents.

938
01:12:25,696 --> 01:12:30,511
May I ask, Alexander,
why you refer to Maurice as "Rab"?

939
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:33,901
 We all call him that.

940
01:12:33,901 --> 01:12:35,916
It's short for Rabbi.

941
01:12:37,594 --> 01:12:43,046
Maurice has progressed while he has
been here, but not to that extent.

942
01:12:43,837 --> 01:12:46,034
Rabbi means teacher.

943
01:12:46,549 --> 01:12:51,046
It was so that Jesus was addressed
by the multitudes.

944
01:12:53,714 --> 01:12:55,845
This is a swell party.

946
01:12:55,845 --> 01:13:02,732
Hey, he ate 17 of those... you know,
like dumplings, only better.
Matzo balls! I bring more.

947
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:05,731
For me, too!

948
01:13:05,971 --> 01:13:08,328
A most successful evening.

949
01:13:09,283 --> 01:13:12,015
I feel much has been accomplished.

951
01:13:18,739 --> 01:13:26,424
I have neglected to thank you
for the privilege of attending
the opening of your new play.

952
01:13:26,424 --> 01:13:29,336
Why didn't you come backstage?

953
01:13:29,336 --> 01:13:34,709
I took the night plane. It was
imperative I be in class the next day

954
01:13:34,709 --> 01:13:40,241
Boy! Old Rab's name up there in
lights. I bet you was...were proud.

956
01:13:40,633 --> 01:13:47,597
As Maurice's former teacher,
I was gratified by his success.
Owch! You didn't like my play?

957
01:13:47,597 --> 01:13:49,798
I am not a critic,...

958
01:13:49,798 --> 01:13:55,286
but with more than 300,000 words at
your disposal in any dictionary,...

959
01:13:55,562 --> 01:14:02,526
.. it did not seem necessary
to allow your characters
expressions that were inelegant,...

960
01:14:02,526 --> 01:14:09,414
.. often profane and - unless
I misinterpreted their meaning -
occasionally improper.

963
01:14:09,491 --> 01:14:16,615
Next time, I'll try to be more...
meticulous?
Discriminating.
Yes, Miss Dove.

964
01:14:16,615 --> 01:14:18,656
What gives, Fred?

967
01:14:18,656 --> 01:14:26,022
You don't get the "Courier".
I'm on the roads.
Acting?
Mostly digging with a pickaxe.

969
01:14:26,391 --> 01:14:33,643
You seem fit and happy.
Sure. Plenty of exercise, plain
food, 12 hours' sleep each night.

972
01:14:33,706 --> 01:14:41,880
Frederick is paying his debt
to society.
Oh, I see.
No big caper, Rab. I got in a jam,..

974
01:14:42,031 --> 01:14:47,925
.. and if I hadn't borrowed
this convertible and wrecked it...
Life can be rugged.

975
01:14:47,925 --> 01:14:53,078
They would have let me off with a
fine and an SS - suspended sentence

976
01:14:53,078 --> 01:14:58,361
.. but I didn't have the dough
and probation makes me nervous.

978
01:14:58,361 --> 01:15:03,609
I can imagine.
Ties you down.
So I decided to do the stretch.

980
01:15:03,684 --> 01:15:07,817
I only got 6 months left.
How come you're on the loose?

981
01:15:08,217 --> 01:15:12,090
Frederick has parole today,
on his own recognizance.

984
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:17,383
Then you're free for lunch.
As a bird!
Sandy and I are meeting at the Club.

985
01:15:17,493 --> 01:15:19,860
The Club? Oh, am I living!

987
01:15:25,058 --> 01:15:28,990
Sorry to intrude, but it's official.

988
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:31,662
Officer Holloway begs to intrude.

991
01:15:31,662 --> 01:15:38,396
Come in, William.
Miss Dove, I hope you're improved.
I appreciate your concern.

992
01:15:38,396 --> 01:15:45,090
Excuse me, but if you don't need me,
I'd enjoy a breath of fresh air.

993
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:49,883
Hiya, Bill! Look who's here - Rab!

995
01:15:50,083 --> 01:15:53,088
How are you?
Say, you're looking sharp.

996
01:15:53,165 --> 01:15:56,933
Don't he?
Once a Marine, always a Marine.

997
01:15:57,007 --> 01:16:01,561
Say, Rab, Sandy and me are having
lunch together. Class reunion.

998
01:16:02,081 --> 01:16:06,213
You'll have to postpone it.
There's conflicting business.

1000
01:16:06,213 --> 01:16:10,696
Is it urgent?
Why not join us? Cops eat, too!

1001
01:16:10,696 --> 01:16:13,298
A most practical suggestion.

1002
01:16:13,298 --> 01:16:19,061
You can discuss business with Fred
as you drive him to his habitation.

1004
01:16:19,061 --> 01:16:26,586
You think it's a good idea?
Yes. It will eliminate Frederick's
need to seek other transportation.

1006
01:16:26,586 --> 01:16:31,429
Yes, Miss Dove.
Phew! As usual,
right on the beam, Miss Dove.

1008
01:16:31,429 --> 01:16:35,071
Would you go for a steak?
With lobster on the side.

1009
01:16:35,071 --> 01:16:38,313
Goodbye, doll. Thanks for the works.

1011
01:16:38,313 --> 01:16:42,035
Goodbye, Maurice.
Be seeing you, Miss Dove.

1012
01:16:42,035 --> 01:16:44,790
Hey, look at me, I almost forgot.

1013
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:53,606
From the joint -
homegrown, hand-picked, by me.

1014
01:16:54,803 --> 01:16:57,205
Then, thank you, Frederick.

1015
01:16:59,076 --> 01:17:03,409
William, ask the floor nurse
to send Billie Jean to me.

1018
01:17:03,409 --> 01:17:08,020
Hey!
Yes, Miss Dove.
I remember! Billie Jean McVeigh!

1020
01:17:08,132 --> 01:17:18,098
You mean she's now a nurse?
An excellent nurse, Frederick.
Kind, courteous, efficient, genteel.

1022
01:17:18,098 --> 01:17:21,661
I have been most fortunate.
Yeah, sure.

1023
01:17:28,584 --> 01:17:31,908
Gee! Dr Baker will be here soon.

1024
01:17:32,787 --> 01:17:37,830
I want things to look fine. I'll
go out and get some fresh water.

1025
01:17:48,807 --> 01:17:56,762
"Patient is a slender, normally-
developed female, aged 55, showing
few of the usual senile changes,...

1026
01:17:56,762 --> 01:18:02,055
"lying quietly in bed, in no apparent
distress. Alert and collected. "

1027
01:18:02,055 --> 01:18:04,855
I'm surprised. I trusted you.

1028
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:09,551
I am guilty but unrepentant.

1030
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:15,536
What I read has restored
my sense of personal identity.

1033
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:21,217
You listen to me.
A chair for Mr Porter.
I'm here to represent Rotary.

1035
01:18:21,217 --> 01:18:27,501
Indeed?
The Rotary Club has voted to assume
full financial responsibility.

1037
01:18:27,581 --> 01:18:36,306
Wherever you have this
operation - Mayo's, John Hopkins -
Rotary is behind you.
And if I decline this offer?

1038
01:18:36,306 --> 01:18:38,438
Why decline it?

1039
01:18:38,438 --> 01:18:44,161
Who gave you this right to walk
the world with this haughty spirit?

1040
01:18:44,161 --> 01:18:48,077
Dear sir, please adopt a civil tone.

1042
01:18:48,594 --> 01:18:52,134
I am not to be bullied.
You talk of bullying!

1043
01:18:52,206 --> 01:18:54,318
She's a stiff-necked termagant.

1044
01:18:54,318 --> 01:18:59,611
How my pride has suffered. Seeing
my best friend's daughter penniless,

1046
01:18:59,611 --> 01:19:06,255
..working for her bread,
wearing outlandish clothes...
Please, Mr Porter.
You forget yourself.

1047
01:19:06,255 --> 01:19:12,499
I forget nothing. I made you
a very civil offer once.
Exactly 15 years ago.

1048
01:19:12,499 --> 01:19:15,621
I was a widower. Rich, but lonely.

1050
01:19:15,621 --> 01:19:23,818
She was an old maid.
Lonely too, but far from rich.
The offer was generous,
but nonetheless ridiculous.

1051
01:19:24,256 --> 01:19:27,432
I shall ignore that final insult.

1052
01:19:27,548 --> 01:19:33,195
It cannot erase the memory that
once, consciously or unconsciously,

1053
01:19:33,272 --> 01:19:38,269
..you did something which was
to put me forever in your debt.

1056
01:19:58,577 --> 01:20:02,910
Fifty,...two hundred...
fifty,...three hundred...

1057
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:05,631
I don't see how Porter lasted.

1058
01:20:05,702 --> 01:20:07,703
My brother was out of...

1059
01:20:07,703 --> 01:20:10,003
..town and lost his last dollar.

1061
01:20:10,115 --> 01:20:15,238
I put it in only yesterday.
He's run out of cash. I told you so.

1062
01:20:15,548 --> 01:20:18,440
Excuse me. I wish to make a deposit.

1063
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:19,327
Excuse me.

1065
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:26,085
Ed, we're friends. If you can wait..
Friends, nothing. I'm withdrawing
every penny of my 6,572 bucks.

1066
01:20:26,325 --> 01:20:31,568
Your transaction will take time,
Mr Prouty, while mine will be brief.

1069
01:20:31,568 --> 01:20:36,641
If you would extend me the courtesy.
Are you nuts?
Thank you.

1073
01:20:36,641 --> 01:20:44,667
Good afternoon, Mr Porter.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon. A pleasant day.
Yes. A touch of spring in the air.

1074
01:20:44,816 --> 01:20:47,025
Miss Dove...

1075
01:20:57,414 --> 01:21:01,066
May I borrow a pen? Mine is dry.

1076
01:21:01,066 --> 01:21:03,023
Of course.

1077
01:21:03,218 --> 01:21:05,198
Thank you.

1078
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:14,683
I'm sorry. By a strange coincidence,
your pen seems to lack ink, too.

1079
01:21:17,316 --> 01:21:19,478
You're looking well, Mr Porter.

1080
01:21:19,478 --> 01:21:23,480
I heard you have had
a mild case of lumbago.

1081
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,278
Thank you.

1082
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:32,046
It's been a bad month for colds.

1083
01:21:32,116 --> 01:21:36,293
So much unseasonable weather
might account for it.

1084
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:42,698
For deposit to my account, Mr Porter.
The entire amount. 98 dollars.

1085
01:21:52,498 --> 01:21:54,866
Thank you, Mr Porter.

1086
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:57,143
Thank you, Miss Dove.

1089
01:22:02,342 --> 01:22:06,706
Mr Prouty! Do you expect Mr Porter
to violate a Federal law?

1090
01:22:06,706 --> 01:22:10,873
Federal banks are compelled
to close at three o'clock.

1091
01:22:11,228 --> 01:22:16,555
All of us here in Liberty Hill will
live to see the merit of this law.

1093
01:22:30,081 --> 01:22:36,014
I am sure the Rotarians intend me
no offence, but I am not a charity.

1094
01:22:36,014 --> 01:22:41,411
It isn't charity Liberty Hill
offers you. It's... it's respect.

1095
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:48,257
That I shall accept
with unqualified pleasure.

1096
01:22:48,652 --> 01:22:53,979
Now, Thomas. Will you be
more specific as to your findings?

1097
01:22:56,386 --> 01:22:58,196
Well,...

1098
01:23:00,259 --> 01:23:04,192
..you have a small growth
on your spine...

1099
01:23:04,192 --> 01:23:07,026
which must, if possible, be removed.

1101
01:23:07,103 --> 01:23:13,113
If possible?
Until we go in, we cannot be certain
about the nature of any tumour.

1102
01:23:13,266 --> 01:23:17,888
All you have to decide is
who shall remove it and where.

1104
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:25,044
Aren't you competent?
I think so. But other surgeons
have more experience and reputation.

1105
01:23:25,044 --> 01:23:29,403
If you go elsewhere, I won't see
it as a reflection on my ability.

1106
01:23:29,638 --> 01:23:33,656
There's a very famous man
at the Mayo Clinic...

1107
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:36,348
Allow me to deliberate.

1108
01:23:39,654 --> 01:23:39,654
I remember that you had
very skilful fingers, Thomas.

1109
01:23:39,654 --> 01:23:45,664
I remember that you had
very skilful fingers, Thomas.

1110
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,387
You have very skilful fingers.

1112
01:23:54,662 --> 01:24:01,549
Could you put it back
exactly as it was, Thomas?
Yes, Miss Dove. I did it before.

1114
01:24:02,308 --> 01:24:05,746
Then do it again.
Yes, Miss Dove.

1116
01:24:14,354 --> 01:24:19,523
I shall feel perfectly safe in the
hands of Thomas and Billie Jean.

1119
01:24:30,305 --> 01:24:34,859
Now the air is clear of emotion,
we can resume our discussion.

1122
01:24:34,927 --> 01:24:41,461
What do you propose?
That it be done tomorrow.
As you told us...
I know what I told you.

1124
01:24:41,532 --> 01:24:45,894
What is the procedure?
This is what will happen.

1125
01:24:45,894 --> 01:24:50,743
This evening at eight, you'll take
a capsule. You'll sleep soundly.

1126
01:24:50,898 --> 01:24:54,940
The next morning, you may not
even notice the hypodermic.

1127
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:58,183
Well, you won't care or shouldn't.

1128
01:24:58,183 --> 01:25:02,464
You'll go to the operating room
and have a general anaesthetic.

1129
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:06,387
Due to the tumour's position,
the operation may be long.

1130
01:25:06,387 --> 01:25:11,231
If so, the anaesthetic will be
prolonged, as will its effects.

1131
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:15,033
It may be Friday
before you finally awake.

1133
01:25:15,844 --> 01:25:19,407
Where?
What?

1134
01:25:19,556 --> 01:25:21,764
Where will I awake?

1135
01:25:23,638 --> 01:25:25,847
I don't know, Miss Dove.

1136
01:25:30,802 --> 01:25:35,208
Open the top drawer of the bureau.
Give me my bag.

1137
01:25:50,505 --> 01:25:52,701
My father's watch.

1139
01:25:53,776 --> 01:25:58,352
No, Miss Dove.
I should like you to take it now.

1140
01:25:58,590 --> 01:26:01,550
It is bequeathed to you in my will.

1141
01:26:01,742 --> 01:26:05,555
If... if on Friday I awaken here,...

1142
01:26:06,584 --> 01:26:10,477
..you may return it
temporarily to my custody.

1143
01:26:42,727 --> 01:26:46,540
Oh, the battle I put up
with this cuticle of mine.

1144
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:48,861
You have the same trouble?

1145
01:26:48,861 --> 01:26:53,664
I always considered the care
of the nails as a boudoir function...

1147
01:26:53,664 --> 01:26:59,417
.. and not a stimulating topic
of conversation.
I beg your pardon!

1150
01:27:05,821 --> 01:27:10,443
There have been some recognizable
developments. And you?

1151
01:27:10,635 --> 01:27:14,482
Oh, glory!
Like the night before Christmas.

1152
01:27:14,837 --> 01:27:20,598
Tomorrow, we'll know what it looks
like... if it's a boy or a girl.

1153
01:27:20,681 --> 01:27:23,288
Well, I'd better go now.

1154
01:27:24,884 --> 01:27:26,876
Good night, Miss Dove.

1156
01:27:28,406 --> 01:27:32,378
Roses in your pillow.
Good night, Virginia.

1157
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:38,499
Hello, Miss Dove.

1159
01:27:39,573 --> 01:27:45,105
Dr Temple, will you write
to your mother tonight?
Why, yes.

1160
01:27:45,336 --> 01:27:52,588
Will you kindly inform her
that red ants have a flavour
exactly like sour pickles.

1161
01:27:52,861 --> 01:27:55,991
They do? Did a bear tell you?

1162
01:27:56,383 --> 01:28:01,426
No. I ascertained the fact for myself
more than 30 years ago.

1164
01:28:02,267 --> 01:28:06,513
You did? How?
I ate one.

1165
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:11,514
Good for you! I won't wait
to write her. I'll send her a wire.

1167
01:28:18,797 --> 01:28:21,404
I'll leave you with your pastor.

1169
01:28:29,884 --> 01:28:33,606
Thomas told you?
Yes.

1170
01:28:34,087 --> 01:28:36,295
I do not wish to die.

1171
01:28:38,529 --> 01:28:43,664
Life, whatever others may think,
has been for me...

1172
01:28:46,374 --> 01:28:49,106
I... I have been happy.

1173
01:28:50,177 --> 01:28:52,191
I know.

1175
01:28:52,588 --> 01:28:59,555
Thomas is not very hopeful, is he?
Well, there is a hope
which transcends the medical.

1176
01:28:59,993 --> 01:29:02,394
Perhaps if we read from this.

1179
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:11,755
Will you read the general confession?
Yes.
Then I warn you, when I say that
prayer, I do so with reservations.

1180
01:29:11,830 --> 01:29:13,801
Reservations?

1181
01:29:13,801 --> 01:29:18,116
I have made many mistakes.
Perhaps even sinned.

1182
01:29:18,965 --> 01:29:21,526
I admit my human limitations.

1183
01:29:21,526 --> 01:29:26,569
But I do not, in all honesty, find
the burden of my sins intolerable.

1184
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:31,322
Nor, Alexander,
have I strayed like a sheep.

1185
01:29:31,322 --> 01:29:36,183
As Frederick Makepeace might say,
I have never been A-W-O-L.

1186
01:29:37,126 --> 01:29:41,539
I grant you the language
of the confession is archaic.

1187
01:29:41,539 --> 01:29:44,612
But it contains a core of truth.
All of us...

1188
01:29:44,851 --> 01:29:52,023
No. I have never spoken hypocrisy
to my Maker and now is hardly
a propitious moment to begin.

1189
01:29:56,108 --> 01:29:59,386
We can have a prayer, if you like.

1191
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:03,922
Silently, but together.
That I should like.

1194
01:30:28,848 --> 01:30:34,927
The parson and the cop are in
the lobby. Potential blood donors.
Good.

1197
01:30:39,294 --> 01:30:44,509
OK.
OK, Tommy.
All right.

1199
01:30:51,102 --> 01:30:59,667
You got the time, pal?
10 after 10. Why worry,
with six months added
for your "stroll" yesterday?

1200
01:30:59,667 --> 01:31:04,550
Would you call a friend of mine,
name of Rab... Maurice Levine?

1201
01:31:04,550 --> 01:31:07,362
Only costs four bits. I'll pay ya.

1203
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:13,403
Reverse the charges?
This guy is loaded.
Keep diggin'.
You're outta privileges.

1204
01:31:13,636 --> 01:31:16,242
Am I paying my debt to society!

1205
01:31:19,119 --> 01:31:24,291
I'm calling a play of which our
old quarterback might not approve.

1206
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:29,767
Cedar Grove Elementary School
is suspending classes for the day.

1208
01:31:51,379 --> 01:31:58,472
It's more extensive than I thought.
She'll need blood and plenty of it.
Yes, Doctor.

1209
01:32:07,278 --> 01:32:10,871
W... What are they doing up there?

1210
01:32:10,871 --> 01:32:13,569
You know Tommy's doing his best.

1211
01:32:13,643 --> 01:32:19,973
Let's stay full of fortitude. You
two sit tight and I'll snoop around.

1213
01:32:31,564 --> 01:32:38,417
How's it going, Miss Rice?
Dr Baker sent a section to the
laboratory. The report isn't back.

1214
01:32:38,488 --> 01:32:40,860
She's had one transfusion.

1216
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:45,254
Is there a chance?
A nurse is permitted no opinions.

1218
01:33:15,311 --> 01:33:20,995
Hey! I saw you coming.
Children aren't allowed.
It's a matter of life or death.

1219
01:33:20,995 --> 01:33:26,128
I was elected spokesman.
We came to give blood to Miss Dove.

1220
01:33:26,128 --> 01:33:31,091
Dope! They lay you down and
then they give you tomato juice.

1221
01:33:31,091 --> 01:33:31,091
Not to folks your age!

1223
01:33:31,091 --> 01:33:35,284
Not to folks your age!
But we're nine!
ALL : Yeah!

1224
01:33:35,284 --> 01:33:39,817
Oh, honeys. We got these
grown-ups waiting here.

1225
01:33:39,817 --> 01:33:42,343
Here's what you can do.

1227
01:33:42,408 --> 01:33:45,265
What?
The State tests are coming up.

1228
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:50,383
If you flunked them, she'd be
good and mad. Go home and study up!

1230
01:33:50,703 --> 01:33:54,152
We know that old junk!
ALL : Yeah!

1233
01:33:54,265 --> 01:34:01,630
Are you sure?
ALL : Sure!
What's longitude and latitude?
Name the Great Lakes!

1234
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:04,874
Where's the Tropic of Capricorn?

1236
01:34:08,314 --> 01:34:10,317
You see?

1237
01:34:11,156 --> 01:34:15,528
You handled that like
a diplomat, Billie Jean.

1238
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:22,089
She herself - Miss Dove - couldn't
have handled it more genteel.

1239
01:34:39,584 --> 01:34:41,655
That's it. Take over.

1241
01:35:18,158 --> 01:35:20,525
Tommy, how did it go?

1243
01:35:31,566 --> 01:35:41,372
Come on, girls.
Let's pull ourselves together.
I can't figure out women. Yesterday
they were clawing Miss Dove apart.

1245
01:35:41,372 --> 01:35:44,902
And now, look at them.
Shut up, Joe. And you too.

1246
01:35:44,902 --> 01:35:47,494
She wasn't your teacher...

1247
01:35:47,494 --> 01:35:52,027
.. or you wouldn't chew
your necktie when you're thinking.

1248
01:35:52,027 --> 01:35:55,379
She broke me of chewing my pigtails.

1249
01:35:55,379 --> 01:35:59,351
I was counting on her
to stop our Susie chewing hers.

1250
01:35:59,351 --> 01:36:06,516
You youngsters probably
don't know, but she stopped
this town going bankrupt.

1252
01:36:06,516 --> 01:36:11,118
Can't they tell us something?
We pay taxes. We got a right to know

1254
01:36:11,118 --> 01:36:16,924
They're waiting for a report
from the laboratory.
That's passing the buck.

1257
01:36:17,723 --> 01:36:26,818
We've heard from the laboratory, the
report won't be ready till tomorrow.

1259
01:36:35,654 --> 01:36:39,536
Cut it out, Bert.
Things are spooky enough.

1260
01:36:39,536 --> 01:36:44,784
No calls, no fights, no wrecks,
no dogs barking. No nothing.

1263
01:36:45,020 --> 01:36:52,584
You're no eye-opener, neither.
You don't even know her.
I know her. I been here long enough.

1264
01:36:52,584 --> 01:36:56,867
I'll be sad to see her go.
But I don't think she cares.

1265
01:36:56,867 --> 01:37:01,870
It wasn't much of a life. No
family, no kids. Never went nowhere.

1266
01:37:01,870 --> 01:37:06,513
She's never been more than
a few hundred miles out of here.

1267
01:37:06,513 --> 01:37:14,448
Sure. But she's been places
we never heard of, round the world
more times than you can count.

1268
01:37:14,518 --> 01:37:18,320
Not much of a life, huh?
No family, no kids.

1269
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:22,723
No kids?
You're really off your rocker.

1270
01:37:22,723 --> 01:37:25,296
Kids? She has a thousand of 'em.

1272
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:36,901
Police station. Mitchell speaking.

1273
01:37:36,972 --> 01:37:39,013
Hello, Warden.

1274
01:37:39,013 --> 01:37:40,675
Hmm?

1275
01:37:40,744 --> 01:37:44,102
Fred Makepeace? On the loose again?

1276
01:37:44,537 --> 01:37:47,712
He's heading for Liberty Hill, huh?

1277
01:37:47,789 --> 01:37:50,420
Sure. We'll keep a lookout.

1278
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:52,629
Right. Good night.

1280
01:37:53,382 --> 01:37:59,473
What's the attraction in this burg
for a thief like Makepeace?
Well, I tell you...

1281
01:37:59,906 --> 01:38:01,920
I don't know.

1283
01:38:41,132 --> 01:38:43,146
Tell me, Thomas.

1284
01:38:44,664 --> 01:38:47,259
Tell me, without wasting a word.

1286
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:15,277
And Virginia?
Twin boys.

1287
01:39:16,153 --> 01:39:18,487
My felicitations, Thomas.

1288
01:39:18,845 --> 01:39:23,638
They're full of beans. You'll
have your hands full, Miss Dove.

1292
01:39:55,148 --> 01:40:00,231
Bells? Why are they ringing?

1294
01:40:00,231 --> 01:40:07,115
Is it Sunday?
Friday. But a big day for Liberty
Hill. The town just heard the news.

1297
01:40:07,115 --> 01:40:13,445
The news?
That you're gonna be all right.
They've been waiting since dawn.

1299
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:19,125
There are people in the streets?
And more coming.

1300
01:40:19,283 --> 01:40:26,887
It's just like the movies
when some queen or bigshot
takes a bow from a balcony.

1301
01:40:49,821 --> 01:40:52,423
There's Mr O'Neil, the mailman...

1302
01:40:52,423 --> 01:40:58,187
and the station master and Dr Hurley
and Ed and Pete from the gas station

1303
01:40:58,187 --> 01:41:02,684
.. and good night! Standing there,
big as life, Fred Makepeace!

1305
01:41:08,683 --> 01:41:15,480
Frederick Makepeace?
Don't worry, Miss Dove.
My Bill's standing next to him.

1307
01:41:16,288 --> 01:41:23,175
 Mr Spivey's carrying on
like he just made a touchdown!
And every kid from Cedar Grove.

1309
01:41:24,173 --> 01:41:30,017
What did you say?
The kids, Miss Dove. Your pupils.
There's no school today.

1310
01:41:30,017 --> 01:41:32,384
No school?

1311
01:41:32,458 --> 01:41:35,730
But you said to...this is Friday?

1313
01:41:35,730 --> 01:41:41,494
Yes, Miss Dove.
The State proficiency test
will take place on Monday.

1314
01:41:41,494 --> 01:41:49,143
Thomas, go down at once and
inform Mr Spivey that the children
must resume their classes.

1315
01:41:51,030 --> 01:41:55,344
The fifth grade will review
the winds and the tides.

1316
01:41:55,422 --> 01:42:00,315
The fourth grade will learn the
products of the Argentine pampas.

1317
01:42:00,315 --> 01:42:05,530
The sixth grade will study
the orographic control of rainfall.

1318
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:10,603
At once, Thomas.

1319
01:42:15,765 --> 01:42:17,961
Good morning, Miss Dove.

1320
01:42:19,047 --> 01:42:21,209
Good morning, Thomas.
