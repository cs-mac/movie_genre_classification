1
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:15,592
Jesus, oh!

2
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,935
Oh God

3
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,933
No Metal in the microwave

4
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,638
No metal!

5
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,208
Martha, it's Robert

6
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,177
Just to let you know
to keep an eye peeled

7
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,316
for the first reviews of
your breathlessly awaited first novel

8
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,618
Word is, the Times is going to rave...

9
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:56,890
Talk later

10
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,037
Thanks

11
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,121
You look like shit

12
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:04,781
Where's Grandpa?

13
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,416
He's so cute with the headphones on

14
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:12,094
Hi Grandpa!

15
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,758
Do you think he remembers me?

16
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,736
Come on, it's a steal
You've got to see it

17
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:19,965
You'll have your own room to write in

18
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:23,338
Grandpa can be out in the back chopping
bricks or whatever he does out there

19
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,774
You'd never even know he existed

20
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,742
l wish he didn't

21
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,745
God, he's really getting you down

22
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,012
From the way Alex has acted
for the last 7 years

23
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,482
you'd have thought
he didn't have a father

24
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,849
And then boom, a month ago
this showed up on the doorstep

25
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,314
l haven't written a word since

26
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,518
Well, Alex has got
to get him out of here

27
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,357
lt's not that simple with Alex

28
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,416
and frankly we can't afford
to buy another place

29
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,126
let alone a mansion

30
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:44,421
Of course you can

31
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,397
especially if your mother's offer
is still good

32
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,833
Alex will never accept money from her
you know that

33
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,226
Work on Him!

34
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,033
For God sakes, Martha
you have a lot to learn about men

35
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,006
And you have a lot to learn
about husbands

36
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,367
Sorry

37
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,334
lt's okay. l'm getting a dog

38
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:14,875
Hi Alex!

39
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,881
Smells good Good Jimmy

40
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,292
Grandpa, l'm home

41
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,588
How's my boy!

42
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,221
What's that?

43
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,126
lt's a book l made for you

44
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,367
Animals that change

45
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:32,963
One day

46
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,633
l saw the most weird thing

47
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,567
lt was a turtle, a fish and a rat

48
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:43,644
They were in a puddle of potion

49
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,010
They grew

50
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,913
They destroy the universe. The end

51
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,487
Jeremy gets some ideas

52
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,355
Come on. Let's clean up for dinner

53
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,661
Dad, you shouldn't eat so much fat
at your age

54
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,971
How are you today?

55
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,305
Did you watch those tapes
l rented for you?

56
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:10,899
Terrible!

57
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,105
l'll get you some Taiwanese tapes

58
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,404
They'll be just as bad

59
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,909
Well, what about
some Hong Kong kung-fu movies?

60
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:17,938
The worst!

61
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,110
Their kung-fu's a joke

62
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,382
Dad! They're only acting

63
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,548
You're a Tai Chi professor
They can't compare

64
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,057
Damn, l can't learn English

65
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,986
lt's a disgrace to go back

66
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,021
My life is going nowhere

67
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,325
Dad

68
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,899
it hasn't even been a month
since you retired and came to America

69
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,130
Give yourself some time

70
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,540
Jeremy come here
come here you little rascal

71
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:53,950
Come here

72
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,589
Come here, Jeremy. Get off the couch

73
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,984
l don't have time for this, come here

74
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,328
Whoa!

75
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,731
My precious young man
running bare naked!

76
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,100
Let me see!

77
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,604
The future of the Chu family
is depending on your little treasure

78
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,038
What does he think he's doing?

79
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:15,665
That's all right

80
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,972
Chinese elders must always
reassure themselves

81
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,375
that their family name will go on

82
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,414
Come on Jeremy, upstairs with you!

83
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,006
She's afraid he'll catch cold

84
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,042
Kids aren't made out of paper

85
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,335
Thanks

86
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,303
Thanks

87
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,346
No, thanks

88
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:02,277
Why does this American woman
only eat vegetables?

89
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,479
She's afraid of getting fat

90
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,014
Why am l not fat?

91
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,060
On this Earth
there are two kinds of food

92
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:13,087
Cereal and vegetables are 'yin'

93
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,664
and meat is 'yang'

94
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,329
You must eat both to be balanced

95
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,396
and to be healthy

96
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,203
Alex, Linda came over today

97
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,038
Great

98
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:25,600
What's that supposed to mean?

99
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,043
Just great

100
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,645
What exactly do you have
against her anyway?

101
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,108
So what if she was a Maoist in college?

102
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,984
From Maoist revolutionary
to real estate baron

103
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,250
lf there's one thing worse
than a communist

104
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,723
it's an ex-communist
who has become a capitalist

105
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,060
Well, she's ready to do us
quite a big favor

106
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,086
Oh no. She's trying to sell us
a house again

107
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,325
What's she mumbling about? Nothing

108
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,098
Something about cigarette butts?

109
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,158
What?

110
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,670
Mommy said she wants to move out

111
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:53,295
Quiet!

112
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,802
Alex, l'm talking to you

113
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,536
Mommy, can l watch cartoons?

114
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,132
Here

115
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:00,637
put some meat on your bones!

116
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,204
l don't want it, thank you

117
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,146
Jeremy, finish your milk
and you can watch TV

118
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:05,573
What did she say?

119
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,343
lf he finishes his milk, he can watch TV

120
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,700
American people teach children

121
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,601
everything's a deal, like doing business

122
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,127
You should at least
take a look at the photos

123
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:30,198
lt's apparently a real steal
lf children can't concentrate on eating

124
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,233
what else can they concentrate on?

125
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,266
Yes, father

126
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,337
And, these American cartoons

127
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,644
are only adding weirdness and violence

128
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,548
to this messed up world

129
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:43,086
for children? lt's just a mess

130
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:47,422
Our sages said... Dad, eat!

131
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,189
Don't get upset. l'm just afraid
your dinner's getting cold

132
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,432
What has he been babbling about?

133
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,403
The violence in cartoons

134
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,066
How can he complain
he's martial arts expert himself

135
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,199
lsn't that violent enough?

136
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:04,431
Would you cut it out? Both of you!

137
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:09,213
Just eat

138
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,194
You finish up. l'm going out for a smoke

139
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:17,711
ln America, you're so polite to kids
You think so?

140
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:21,878
You don't treat kids as kids

141
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,217
lt's not so simple

142
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,485
lt's called democracy

143
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,686
No big and no little

144
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,763
l see, you understand America
better than me

145
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,632
Chinese Time

146
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,866
Jeremy, stop playing

147
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,369
Come on, time for homework

148
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,195
Alex

149
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,424
The teachers' Putonghua is poor

150
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,399
ls his Chinese school any good?

151
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,532
Don't be too picky!

152
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,734
We only have one Chinese school
around here

153
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,706
Every weekend
Jeremy learns some Chinese

154
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:16,833
l can play basketball

155
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,206
and you get to teach Tai Chi

156
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,801
Thanks God for it!

157
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,507
Let's follow what they teach

158
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,242
Eh! Not like that

159
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,581
Dad, l've got some things
to take care of

160
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,951
Jeremy, come on

161
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:35,585
Grandpa will teach you
an old Chinese rhyme

162
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,289
On East West Street, North South Go

163
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,594
Outside the gate, a man bites a dog!

164
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,657
Grab the dog to hit a brick

165
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,669
Watch out
that brick might bite the hand

166
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,364
Follow Grandpa

167
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,498
On East West Street

168
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,337
North South Go

169
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,343
Outside the gate a man bites a dog

170
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,005
Outside the gate a dog bites a man

171
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,941
a man bites a dog!

172
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:00,985
a man bites a dog!

173
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:26,366
Shit

174
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,518
Just one more sentence

175
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:17,690
Okay

176
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:27,695
How's your computer virus?

177
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:29,465
Almost killed

178
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,436
and when can l start reading
your new book?

179
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,146
There is no new book, can't you tell?

180
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,013
Shit Alex, are as out of it
as your father?

181
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:48,784
You don't know my father

182
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,163
l have spent every single day

183
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:56,690
in the same room with that man
since he showed up here a month ago

184
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,497
Alex, it's impossible

185
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:02,906
He's taken over my work room

186
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,904
l just don't have the space to think

187
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,912
Not enough space?

188
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:12,082
ln China, this house is big enough
for four families

189
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,450
Sure, but they'd speak the same language
so they could talk to each other

190
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,047
Alex he hasn't learned
one word of English

191
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,521
And what about you?

192
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:23,483
What have you done but make fun of him
treating him with disrespect?

193
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:24,756
Alex, l tried

194
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,122
l'm his only son
What do you want me to do?

195
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:31,533
You could at least consider moving
into a bigger place. We can afford it

196
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,161
No

197
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:34,932
l don't see
why we have to pay for his insurance

198
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,907
let him eat us out of house and home

199
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:39,069
when we can't accept a little loan
from my mother

200
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,841
lt's not a little loan, it's a bride
a big bride and you know it

201
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,488
You look a little freaked out here

202
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,533
Come on, let's go to bed

203
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:18,708
Good night Alex

204
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,313
Honestly Linda
l don't know why we're here

205
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,848
Come on, let's explore

206
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:10,635
Father-and-son

207
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:11,601
Father

208
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,715
Sweep

209
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:04,620
Step back

210
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,681
Collect

211
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,215
Hook

212
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,123
Step out

213
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:15,124
Single whip

214
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,161
Play guitar

215
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:21,936
Lean

216
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,375
White crane spreads its wing

217
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:29,270
Left hand ward off

218
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,611
Right hand attack

219
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:35,279
Excuse me, are you the instructor here?

220
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,617
l teach the cooking class

221
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,885
My name is Chen and you?

222
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:41,659
What's your name?

223
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:42,216
Chu

224
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:43,318
Master Chu

225
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,659
Please, we're all friends here

226
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:46,925
Don't call me master

227
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:51,325
Mr. Chu, l don't know
what our headmaster's thinking

228
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:55,662
my class is making dumplings, half-done

229
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,868
Some workmen just came in
to do some repairs

230
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,672
we have to leave

231
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,679
l see you have plenty of space here

232
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,374
could we move in

233
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,279
just this once?

234
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,647
Dumplings can be moved in

235
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,676
but they can't be moved out

236
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,818
We've also got scallion pancakes
and spring rolls!

237
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,454
Come on, let's help!

238
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,025
Thank you

239
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,990
Sink your chest

240
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,259
Stretch your back

241
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,699
lmagine a string pulling up your head

242
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:26,203
Sink lower your body

243
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,228
Master Chu

244
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,232
don't torture the child!

245
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,709
Look at all his weight

246
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:33,904
How can he 'sink his chest'?

247
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:35,972
Let him help me knead the dough

248
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,444
Oh, it's so difficult

249
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:42,453
Mrs. Chen, next week
l'll help you make dumplings

250
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:43,753
Can l enroll?

251
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,713
Next week, no dumplings

252
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:46,951
but General Tso's Special Chicken

253
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:03,062
Master Chu, would you please demonstrate

254
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,466
how to emit force with Pushing Hands?

255
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,771
Okay, let's try Thank you

256
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,853
My God, would that hurt?

257
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:46,107
Hey, Mr. Chu, try me

258
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,406
You're too heavy

259
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:50,812
So your kung-fu can only go so far!

260
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:51,807
Okay

261
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:56,954
Mr. Chu, can you take the fighting away?

262
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:58,389
Don't you see these burners

263
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,981
and the boiling water!

264
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,514
lt's alright if Heavyweight gets burned
but the dumplings!

265
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,186
lf you smash them
what're we going to eat?

266
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:04,459
We'll eat roast pigging!

267
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,228
Oh, okay!

268
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:17,602
Far enough? l'm ready Master!

269
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,488
What! Haven't you any eyes to see!

270
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,861
Sorry...!

271
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:44,926
l don't mean you!

272
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:46,659
lt's your Master who wasn't looking

273
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,302
of all the directions!

274
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,364
Why did you throw Heavyweight
right smack on the dumplings!

275
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,875
Excellent aim!

276
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,967
Okay! No dumplings today!

277
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,946
lnstead, we'll have sandy crab
scalded noodle lump soup!

278
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,011
l'm sorry

279
00:31:58,917 --> 00:31:59,906
lt wasn't on purpose!

280
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,449
lt was on purpose

281
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,578
Are you okay? lt was on purpose!

282
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:05,683
Got mad

283
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,185
ln front of all these people
sooner or later

284
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:11,627
l knew you'd show off!

285
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,024
Sorry...!

286
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,900
Okay! Don't stand there with a red face!

287
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,562
Let's clean up!

288
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:21,201
Everyone helps!

289
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,230
No more Tai Chi Chuan!
We'll make dumplings!

290
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,438
Come... Did you hear that?

291
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,535
Master says no more Tai Chi!

292
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:30,069
Let's move

293
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,453
Oh my, what's this shape?

294
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,117
Hold on. Let me see your hands. Filthy!

295
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,059
Men, all of you wash your hands

296
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,324
Use soap! No dirty hands on my dumplings

297
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,990
ls that clear? Quick...

298
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,357
Mr. Chu, sit!

299
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:51,925
Let the young people stand

300
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:52,937
Come and sit

301
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,902
Not bad

302
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,932
Thin skin, plump stuffing, nice twist

303
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,206
lt's nothing

304
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,913
Northerners like making things
from dough

305
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,279
Are you from Peking? Yes

306
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,982
How long have you been here?

307
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:07,950
Just over a month

308
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,212
Are you used to it here?

309
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,248
lf l was
would l be here messing around?

310
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,156
Watch what you're saying, l'm here too

311
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,518
l don't mean that

312
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:20,029
America is a world for young people

313
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,996
Are you also from Peking?

314
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,159
Do l seem like l am?

315
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,161
By your accent, yes;
the way you look, no

316
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:27,096
That's right

317
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,570
1949, l went with my husband to Taiwan
to escape the Communists

318
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,568
And Mr. Chen is... He's dead

319
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:35,978
His name wasn't Chen

320
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:39,472
Not long after we arrived in Taiwan
he got liver cancer and passed away

321
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,517
l'm called Mrs. Chen

322
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:43,110
because of my second husband

323
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,119
Oh

324
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:46,988
and Mr. Chen?

325
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,118
He's dead too, just last year

326
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,095
Life and death, it's fate

327
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,599
Riches and rags are given by the gods
You just accept it. Everything is destiny

328
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,123
Sure...

329
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:01,237
Earlier this year, l left Taiwan
came to live with my daughter

330
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:05,003
Every Saturday, l bring my granddaughter
here to study Chinese

331
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,541
Are you used to it here?

332
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:08,636
How did you put it just now?

333
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,473
lf l wasn't so bored at home

334
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:14,041
how could your Heavyweight
have smashed my dumplings?

335
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:15,779
A computer couldn't have aimed
more accurately

336
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,354
Destiny, it's all destiny

337
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,219
That's right!

338
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:28,828
What kung-fu!

339
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,462
What's the matter?

340
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,333
Since last year
sometimes my right arm just gives out

341
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,630
when l pick up something a little heavy

342
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:38,642
lt's helpless

343
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,806
Have you seen a doctor? Yes

344
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,471
Chinese doctors, western doctors

345
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:47,084
accupressure, acupuncture
herbal remedies, shots, medicine

346
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,243
l've tried everything
but getting a spell cast on me

347
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,254
l'm just old

348
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:55,223
Mrs. Chen, l don't want to sound
like a self-promoter

349
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:59,161
but practising Tai Chi will heal your arm

350
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,695
Okay, spare me!

351
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,392
Haven't l suffered enough in this life?

352
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,760
Practise? l won't be that stupid enough

353
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:08,670
No, when you practise Tai Chi
your circulation and energy will flow

354
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:11,072
l've let go, l'm not holding on

355
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,572
Energy must be released to me

356
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,148
When its released there's no tension
and one feels at ease

357
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,274
What's up?

358
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,679
The review, l can't find it

359
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:17,258
When you arrive at old age
everything is quiet

360
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,763
There the gentle wind passes through
the pine forest

361
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:24,240
15 minutes to practice Okay

362
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:29,303
When the moon is rising
and shining on the mountain

363
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:35,543
l only want to go to the familiar forest
l reply with a simple fisherman's song

364
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:38,616
Alex

365
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:40,521
Yes?

366
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,822
Does New York have a place
to mat Chinese calligraphy?

367
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:44,257
Who's the present for?

368
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:48,264
You know, last week
l smashed Mrs. Chen's dumplings

369
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:51,268
l was so embarrassed
l want to give her this

370
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:52,700
l'm just afraid she'll laugh
at my calligraphy

371
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,270
Come on Dad

372
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,671
we know you're good

373
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,271
What's the matter?

374
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,805
They've ignored the book

375
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:04,212
Just pretended it doesn't exist

376
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:05,442
lt'll be in next week

377
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,708
What's a matter with her?

378
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:08,810
There's no review of her book

379
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:13,280
Years from now
we'll all be lying peacefully underground

380
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:14,951
What's the big deal?

381
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,762
Dad, when're we going? Coming

382
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,667
What is it?

383
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:26,363
A stomach cramp or something
Nothing important

384
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:27,962
Do you want to lie down on the couch?

385
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:37,443
What's wrong with her?

386
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,709
A stomach cramp

387
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,416
Let me take a look. Make her lie down

388
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:44,718
Dad said he wants to take a look at it

389
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,423
He knows this kind of thing
He does?

390
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,792
He's an expert

391
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:59,792
She's too tense
something's wrong with her stomach

392
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,770
You're too tight
Thanks for letting me know

393
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:05,307
Tell her to relax

394
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:07,872
Just relax

395
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:32,868
What happened? Mom!

396
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:35,463
Oh my god! Get away from me! Relax!

397
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,564
What did you do to her?

398
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,507
Her stomach's bleeding!
Quick get her to the hospital!

399
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,369
l want to go too Jeremy, be good

400
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,063
You broke Mama

401
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,738
Jeremy wants a goldfish, right?

402
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,442
Here's a big tail

403
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,617
Big eyes and thick lips

404
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:38,795
And wings

405
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,978
What's Martha's condition?

406
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,455
Her stomach was bleeding
She has to stay in the hospital

407
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,916
How's Mommy?

408
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:02,048
Oh

409
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,022
Mommy is all right
She just needs a little rest, okay?

410
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,428
l didn't do anything to her

411
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,632
Her tension caused her stomach to bleed

412
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:18,465
l know that

413
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,453
Can l go to the hospital with you?

414
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:51,666
Dad

415
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:54,667
ls this the calligraphy you want matted?

416
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,571
Go take care of Martha

417
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:58,843
Don't bother about me

418
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:20,297
Can l have some macaroni
and cheese please?

419
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:24,968
Wait until Sunday
when your mother comes home, all right?

420
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:56,629
Master Chu Hello everybody!

421
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:59,307
Master Chu, they tell me
your kung-fu is great

422
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,937
Last week, you barely touched Mr. Sung
and you sent him flying

423
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:03,947
And you threw Heavyweight
right on the dumplings

424
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:08,040
Nah, where's Mrs. Chen then?

425
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,187
l don't know. She's not coming anymore
l'm the new teacher

426
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:12,654
Not teach? Yes

427
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,317
Why? l don't know

428
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:15,986
You can ask them

429
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,522
Her family's going to that other school
north of here

430
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:22,999
lf you want to contact her, you can ask
the principal about her telephone number

431
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,563
Okay, l'll go for my class

432
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:31,106
ls this General Tso's Special Chicken?

433
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,669
No, we aren't making chicken
This is to make 'eoly ice'

434
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,940
'Eoly ice'? Yes

435
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:39,745
Oily rice. Oh yes, OlLY RlCE!

436
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:48,249
Hey, do you want us to bring the oily
rice over so you can throw Heavyweight in?

437
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,316
Alex, will you make a call for me?

438
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:23,389
Mrs. Chen's family
doesn't come here anymore

439
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,326
l still have to

440
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:27,762
give her the calligraphy

441
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:36,098
No one's home. lt's their machine

442
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:41,143
Yici Chen. This is Alex Chu

443
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,237
My Dad has a present to give your mother

444
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,611
Give us a call

445
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:47,208
at 287-0425. Thanks

446
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,086
How can you talk like that?

447
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:52,315
Like what?

448
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:55,051
l'm not going to the hospital
with you to see Martha

449
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:56,684
Take me home to wait for the call

450
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:58,694
Relax Dad, they're not going anywhere

451
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,321
l can't communicate with Martha

452
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:04,130
You'll be there for hours
and all l can do is stare into space

453
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:05,362
Okay

454
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:09,670
Hey mister, don't kid me

455
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:11,439
l never kid anybody

456
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:37,757
Hello... lt's me

457
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,863
Mrs. Chen?

458
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:45,832
Why weren't you at school?

459
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:48,795
Yes...

460
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:52,069
Don't listen to my kid. What nonsense!

461
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,103
lt's not a present

462
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:57,506
l'm still embarrassed

463
00:46:58,015 --> 00:46:59,880
about what l did to your class last week

464
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:06,551
Okay. How about this?

465
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,022
Tomorrow at 1 1 :00, my son's going to get
his wife at the hospital

466
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:14,792
We'll come by at 10:30

467
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:16,997
Okay...

468
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:22,271
lt's nothing

469
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:23,466
She's a small stomach problem

470
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,911
Right, then

471
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:32,877
see you tomorrow

472
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:03,870
Hello, Uncle Chu!

473
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:05,609
Not at all, welcome!

474
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,178
Mother, they come!

475
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:08,313
How are you, Yici?

476
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:11,048
Hi! Hi, Jeremy Hi, auntie

477
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,052
Why are you all guarding the door?

478
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,318
Come in, sit down!

479
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,952
Sorry, we've got to get to the hospital
to pick up my wife

480
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,052
Oh, you can't be late then

481
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:19,323
ls your wife, all right?

482
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:21,928
What am l talking about!

483
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:23,465
She's getting out of the hospital

484
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:26,465
Mr. Chu, how are you?

485
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:30,865
Good, Mrs. Chen, at your new school

486
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,001
is there a cooking class?

487
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,405
Not until l showed up

488
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:37,105
There's a kung-fu class too

489
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,878
But it's only Karate

490
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:41,443
They don't have grace

491
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,214
Better than Tai Chi Chuan

492
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:46,356
they sound much tougher

493
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,082
but they can't throw anywhere near
as far as you!

494
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:51,187
Dad, we'd better get going

495
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,026
l planned for you to stay for lunch

496
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,087
but you've got to get to the hospital

497
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:55,660
l won't keep you

498
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,064
for dinner

499
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:59,895
Next time Thanks and bye

500
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:06,003
Uh, you stopped by today to?

501
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:09,946
Ah! l forget

502
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:12,174
You shouldn't have. Thank you

503
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:13,608
l'm going to hang it up right away

504
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,584
lt's nothing

505
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,086
Drive carefully!

506
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,047
Bye

507
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,248
Good bye!

508
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:21,083
Bye!

509
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:28,721
What's the rush!
We didn't even get the scroll open!

510
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:44,945
Thanks!

511
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:25,653
Toothache?

512
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:39,102
There isn't much you can do
But you sure have a lot of problems

513
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,341
Mr. Philips called

514
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:51,814
Jeremy received the lowest
reading scores in the gifted class again

515
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:54,174
That school is too distracting for him

516
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,378
No Alex, we're too distracting for him

517
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,354
He's only responding
to the situation at home

518
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,286
Then change it

519
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:09,630
What's your problem?

520
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:10,726
What's your problem?

521
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:11,563
l ain't got any problem

522
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,091
Get back in the car, Alex!

523
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,195
Shut up!

524
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,198
Great

525
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:33,507
Martha

526
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:36,845
What do you want? l go for a walk

527
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,515
A walk? l don't know

528
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:41,421
l don't want to see you getting lost

529
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:42,320
Smoking

530
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:43,758
You know, in a way
l'm kind of baby sitting you

531
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:48,560
l'll just hang around, won't go far
Do you understand what l'm saying to you?

532
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:50,395
All right. Go ahead

533
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:53,134
What do l care?

534
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:09,249
Oh Jeremy, where'd you get those?

535
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:10,886
Teddy gave them to me

536
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:12,778
Well go put them away

537
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:16,583
Go on. Go get yourself cleaned up

538
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:19,752
Dad

539
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,203
What're you looking for? Dad

540
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:28,761
Where's he?

541
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:29,598
Oh

542
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:31,535
Where's he?

543
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:17,546
ls he back? No

544
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:14,776
Did you check with the police?

545
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:42,905
Alex, l'm sorry
l should've been more careful

546
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:45,407
But l'm... uh... with the book

547
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:50,574
ln some ways, your father is more and
more like a child cooped up here with me

548
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:52,376
And l can't talk to him

549
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,481
l was trying to write

550
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,486
l had a feeling that
he was gonna get himself lost

551
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,919
just like a kid
trying to get some attention

552
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:07,396
l grew up believing
you should care for your parents

553
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:08,795
the way they care for you

554
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,329
My father is a part of me

555
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,962
Why can't you accept that?

556
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:25,377
l know. l tried

557
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:28,416
Just leave me alone

558
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:58,032
Oh my god. You've found him
Thanks God he's safe

559
00:57:58,208 --> 00:57:59,607
We're looking for Mr. Alex Chu

560
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:03,545
Alex is still out
looking for his father. l'm his wife

561
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:06,214
Okay. Mr. Chu, you take care of yourself
All right?

562
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,745
Thank you very much officers

563
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:15,591
Alex is still out looking for you
Are you hungry?

564
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,090
Thirsty?

565
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:40,205
You really should eat something

566
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:50,592
l'm sorry too. Alex is furious

567
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:07,325
Jesus How did you get so drunk?

568
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,102
Where did you go?

569
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:11,731
l was just walking around

570
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,743
and l lost sight of the church steeple
my landmark

571
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:17,870
Policemen brought him back two hours ago

572
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:21,172
You're back, that's good

573
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:08,628
What are you doing?...
What're you doing, Alex?

574
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:09,629
Nothing

575
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,100
l know this wall, it isn't thick

576
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:15,029
What are you doing?...

577
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:18,237
Mommy

578
01:01:19,642 --> 01:01:21,803
Calm down...

579
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,778
Jeremy, Dad isn't feeling well

580
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:31,718
he'll be all right

581
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:34,180
Let me talk to him

582
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:39,055
Dad banged his head by accident

583
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:40,254
Do you need a band aid?

584
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:41,128
Okay

585
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:53,208
Jeremy... is the good one

586
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:59,907
who knows better than Mommy and Grandpa
how to care for Daddy

587
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,732
l haven't seen you that drunk
since the night we got married

588
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,173
That drunk? Yeah

589
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:33,077
Well, my head is clear now

590
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:34,276
What're you mumbling about?

591
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:37,781
l've made up my mind already

592
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,353
About what?

593
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:42,083
The old man has got to go

594
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:45,359
l'll send him
to an old people's apartment

595
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:48,831
Are you sure?

596
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:51,824
l really don't have too much choice

597
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,871
l'll go tell him right now

598
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:34,140
Come in

599
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:39,880
Dad, why didn't you get up
and exercise today?

600
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,114
Aren't you feeling well?

601
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:48,916
What's wrong?

602
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:53,861
l probably caught cold
from being outside too long last night

603
01:03:58,201 --> 01:03:59,225
l'm going to call a doctor

604
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:02,332
You've got important business at work

605
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,601
Don't waste your time on me

606
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:07,007
Come on Dad, cut it out!
You're never sick

607
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,001
if you don't feel well
it must be serious

608
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,104
l'll find a doctor for you

609
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:17,341
Why get sick now?
The vital organs aren't in harmony

610
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:20,014
The circulation's blocked
That's why l'm sick

611
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:46,071
Dad, Ma's been gone for so many years

612
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:47,980
and you've never wanted
to look at her picture

613
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,375
l couldn't face her

614
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:53,182
Do you remember this scar!?

615
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,892
The day when the red guards
came to our house

616
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:00,858
they knew they couldn't hurt me

617
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:03,524
so they took it out on you
and your mother

618
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,624
l only had this one body!

619
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:08,926
ln protecting you
l couldn't protect your mother

620
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:13,267
When they finally stopped their beating
she was too gravely injured to survive

621
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:17,104
ln this one life
l can never face your mother again

622
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:18,374
but l can face you!

623
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:22,084
lt's been so many years

624
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:23,608
why talk about it now?

625
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:26,878
l feel stifled

626
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:29,151
Let me tell you something

627
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:31,921
compared to loneliness
persecution is easy

628
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:34,929
Look at how much hardship

629
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:39,925
and injustice l've endured

630
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:42,267
in the last 40 years

631
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,999
Their tortures only inspired me
to perfect my kung-fu

632
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,435
To study the Soft lnternal Style
of Strength

633
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:52,413
we pursue more refined states of being

634
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:55,481
with the loss of tension
we attain concentration

635
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:59,420
And from that one
we achieve carefree nothingness

636
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:02,117
but this is nearly impossible to attain

637
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:06,685
Yes, it's easy to have physical strength
but inner strength is harder to practise

638
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:10,062
Go on, don't bullshit me!

639
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:14,936
Okay, l'll go call a doctor

640
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:20,402
Do me a favor
and call the Chinese school principal

641
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:22,377
tell him l can't teach
the class on Saturday

642
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:25,036
Okay. You'll go when you're better

643
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:26,605
l'm not going anymore

644
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:28,012
Why?

645
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:32,044
The students always want me to show off
l hate that

646
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:34,416
Then what will you do on the weekends?

647
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:38,491
Why don't we change
to that school north of here

648
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,128
You mean with Mrs. Chen?

649
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:44,094
No! They say it'll be good
for Jeremy's studies

650
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:47,297
l heard they're much stricter

651
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:50,131
How about it?

652
01:06:58,147 --> 01:06:59,375
So did you tell him?

653
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:01,747
He's sick. Caught a cold from last night

654
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:02,675
l couldn't tell him

655
01:07:02,718 --> 01:07:03,707
l hope it's not serious

656
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:05,485
No, l don't think so

657
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:08,055
But l'd better take him to the doctor's

658
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:11,591
l've got a great idea

659
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:13,993
about what to do with him
without hurting anyone's feelings

660
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:16,987
What's that?

661
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:22,003
Just be patient

662
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:25,303
Promise me, you'll be nice to him
for the time being

663
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:27,104
Okay? Go on!

664
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:40,588
What? Nothing

665
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:42,820
Then why do you keep looking
at your watch?

666
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:44,788
Nothing

667
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:55,292
Hello... yes, l am. Yici

668
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:58,106
How's the picnic? Thanks

669
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:03,068
Sorry for bothering you again

670
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:04,305
Yes, it's great weather

671
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:06,143
and great for a picnic

672
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:08,072
Unfortunately
he doesn't have much energy now

673
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:10,551
lf he got sick again, it'll be trouble

674
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:12,814
Take a break

675
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:16,616
Say thank you to Chen Mama for me

676
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:18,092
Okay

677
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:19,754
Don't hang up Hold on

678
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:22,090
Who said l'm sick?

679
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:24,265
l didn't say sick, l said energy

680
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:27,827
No energy - means you need to get out!

681
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:33,832
My father says he's fine

682
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:35,366
he'd like to get some exercises

683
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:38,803
Let's use our plan then Okay

684
01:08:38,848 --> 01:08:42,579
Okay, that's settled then

685
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:43,380
Bye

686
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:45,614
Right

687
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:47,349
How can it be healthy

688
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:50,415
to stay home all the time!

689
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:09,506
Ma, l've already had two

690
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:10,477
Have more

691
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,245
Here Yi-yi Thank you

692
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,215
Kids should eat more

693
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:17,845
Jeremy

694
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:18,854
No, thanks

695
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:20,884
Have more!

696
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,624
Help yourself, don't worry about him

697
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:24,216
Have another piece No...

698
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:25,625
There's lots of meat

699
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,151
no point is saving it

700
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:29,728
l have to leave some room for tonight

701
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:31,693
lt's the middle of the day

702
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:33,531
You're a big man!

703
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:34,568
Come on!

704
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:36,230
l haven't eaten since yesterday morning

705
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:37,864
l'm preparing for the dinner
you're cooking tonight

706
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:39,241
You stupid one

707
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:41,636
Nonsense! Here

708
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:44,572
He's reaching middle age

709
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:45,375
he's afraid of fat

710
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:47,882
cholesterol, and high blood pressure
Give it to me

711
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:52,819
Ma, again?

712
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,516
Yes, damn it

713
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:56,380
Can you give me a little massage?

714
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:03,490
Let me take a look

715
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,759
How can l let you do that?

716
01:10:06,902 --> 01:10:07,664
lt's okay

717
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:15,868
Did you find the spot?

718
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:17,540
This is trouble

719
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,673
lf it's trouble, leave it alone No

720
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:25,277
There's too little flow
and too much blood

721
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:28,154
This kind of problem
is called Mid-Spring Paralysis

722
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:31,557
Now try to move the pinky toe
on your left foot

723
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:38,732
Did you feel that subtle pain?

724
01:10:40,336 --> 01:10:41,268
So, l was right

725
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:43,168
When this illness gets serious

726
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:46,174
you'll get a spasm under your knee
sore waist

727
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:48,506
you back will give out
your neck will tense up

728
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:51,638
you won't be able to lift your arm

729
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,241
and your muscles will be stretched
between your armpits in one tight knot

730
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:57,844
Enough! ln a minute

731
01:10:57,886 --> 01:11:00,684
you'll be looking right through
at all my internal organs!

732
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:01,821
Let me see

733
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:04,292
lt's her right shoulder that's stiff

734
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:05,520
He knows!

735
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:07,290
He was rubbing your left hand

736
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:07,920
Shush!

737
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:32,286
lt's burning Burning?

738
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:33,754
Your meat, on the barbeque

739
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:39,254
Why don't you pay attention
to your own business

740
01:11:40,262 --> 01:11:41,251
Mr. Chu, thank you

741
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,390
l've just begun

742
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:46,627
You've got a complicated problem

743
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:48,398
lt would take over a year of treatment
to get results

744
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,405
What a bother!
Okay, don't break me apart

745
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:55,909
Jeremy, let's go play frisbee

746
01:11:55,944 --> 01:11:56,911
Oh goody, goody

747
01:11:56,945 --> 01:11:58,344
l would like looking

748
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:01,009
Don't go too far, you hear me?
Okay

749
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:14,352
Mr. Chu, your kung-fu is so powerful

750
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:15,795
how do you manage
to have such elegant calligraphy?

751
01:12:15,964 --> 01:12:18,831
l'm ashamed to talk about it

752
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:21,960
My grandfather
was a Ching Dynasty Scholar

753
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,495
my father was one of the founders

754
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:27,509
of the Nationalist government

755
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:30,438
My son is a Ph D in computer science

756
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:32,447
ln the middle of this line

757
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:35,382
there's worthless me

758
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:37,351
Fate and circumstances

759
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:40,321
pushed me to spend my life

760
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:42,415
practising martial arts

761
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:44,755
You shouldn't say that

762
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:49,625
l had bad health when l was a kid

763
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:51,690
l'm an only son

764
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:54,328
My family was worried

765
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:57,362
They took one of the doctor's advice

766
01:12:57,406 --> 01:13:01,342
which is, and made me practise kung-fu

767
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:04,104
l couldn't take the rough styles

768
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:08,480
l could only take the gentle styles
like Tai Chi Chuan

769
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:15,955
Who would have thought that
a couple years later

770
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:19,017
l was completely vigorous and healthy

771
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:21,590
At 30

772
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,758
l won a national
Tai Chi Pushing Hands Championship

773
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,360
Exercising the body
and teaching students

774
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:30,394
That's a relatively simple
trouble-free life

775
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:32,997
What's good?

776
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:37,102
Since the communist liberation
l've been persecuted in every movement

777
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,903
Let's not talk about it

778
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:42,383
Teaching students has hurt me so much

779
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:43,385
Yes

780
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:46,380
Have you gone back to see your old home
and relatives since Taiwan loosened up?

781
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:48,115
Last year

782
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,949
l went back but l don't have any
close relative just a few nieces

783
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:52,551
and nephews

784
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:55,658
Still, a reunion with your family

785
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:59,196
it must have been a happy time

786
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:00,402
Not really

787
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,566
When l left, they weren't born

788
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:08,209
l felt like Santa Claus

789
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:10,134
giving so many gifts

790
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:11,441
None of them were born when l left!

791
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:13,640
Peking seemed to have

792
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:15,745
lost its flavor

793
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:17,911
the old warmth was gone

794
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:21,956
But l was very young
when l left 40 years ago

795
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:25,083
maybe my memories are mistaken

796
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:26,094
Anyway

797
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:30,430
l don't know what it was

798
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:32,160
everything seemed unreal. l couldn't
put my old and new impression together

799
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:35,196
Your impressions are not mistaken

800
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:36,829
Peking has changed a lot

801
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:38,569
ls that so?

802
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:45,810
When l talk with you, l feel closer
to you than with my neighbors in Peking

803
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:46,644
Really?

804
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:49,875
Relax, don't move

805
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:17,874
Ma, you're still in one piece

806
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:19,111
You child!

807
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:21,906
We're going to take the kids up the hill

808
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:23,615
Don't go too far Okay

809
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:26,144
Don't leave us here!

810
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:26,813
l'm going with you

811
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:28,547
Ma, it's a steep climb

812
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:29,454
You won't make it

813
01:15:29,491 --> 01:15:31,482
l'll take it slow

814
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,053
Come on! Let's get everything cleaned up

815
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:35,063
and put in the car

816
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:46,969
Let the young folks go ahead

817
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:48,576
You take it slow

818
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:50,170
No, l'm fine

819
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,110
How come your son-in-law
didn't come today?

820
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,982
Gone... gone... a... way on bus...

821
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:00,544
business

822
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:02,318
lf he weren't away we wouldn't have you
over for dinner

823
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:04,850
Don't mention him

824
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:06,622
He makes me angry

825
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:08,160
What about your daughter-in-law?

826
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:11,328
Ah... let's go

827
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:23,069
Chen Mama, it's too much for you
Let's go down

828
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:24,339
Nonsense! Let's go!

829
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:06,782
Don't run so fast, wait for me

830
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:08,590
Hey!

831
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:17,360
The young are so energetic

832
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:20,201
They can't slow down. Let them go ahead

833
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:22,668
l'll climb slowly with you. Why not
sit down and rest a bit

834
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:33,343
l'm old, useless

835
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:34,747
No one wants me

836
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:38,211
We're out for fun
Why get mad at the kids?

837
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:42,849
How can you be so developed in kung-fu
and not have any insight?

838
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:45,284
They set us up

839
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:46,251
Set us up?

840
01:17:47,629 --> 01:17:49,153
Your precious son came
to our house last week

841
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:51,722
and arranged for my daughter

842
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:54,930
to call and invite you

843
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:57,730
They thought l was taking a nap

844
01:17:57,773 --> 01:17:59,138
but l heard everything

845
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:01,072
Can't be?

846
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:02,167
How come

847
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:04,702
at our age

848
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:07,743
we don't have any self-respect?

849
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:09,216
Letting two children manipulate us!

850
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:12,750
What is this?

851
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:18,351
l'm old and useless

852
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:32,201
Son, thank you for your good will

853
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:36,142
trying to fix me up with Mrs. Chen

854
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:38,373
But we still have our pride
No need to drive me out

855
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:39,744
l have the sense to leave on my own

856
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:43,342
You know the saying
'lt's easier to struggle together

857
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:44,750
than to pass happy days together'

858
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:46,351
l never imagined

859
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:49,050
this would apply to us

860
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:52,421
ln China

861
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:56,888
we managed to stay happily together
through so many bitter times

862
01:18:57,332 --> 01:18:59,698
but here in America
with so many fine material things

863
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,169
it seems there's no place
in your home for me

864
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:05,433
Comparing the two

865
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:10,411
l can't help but recall the days
when you were a small lovely boy

866
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:12,102
Don't look for me

867
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:15,477
Enjoy your life with your family

868
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:17,712
l wish you all the best

869
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:20,010
lf you have time

870
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:22,353
send my regards to Mrs. Chen
and her daughter

871
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:26,986
The world is so big
l'll find a little room

872
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:30,794
where l can spend my worthless old age

873
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:33,398
Life passes before one's eyes like smoke
nothing but emptiness

874
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:36,962
One shouldn't set
one's heart on anything

875
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:38,905
Father

876
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:52,242
Thank you, come again

877
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:54,481
Bye-bye

878
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:06,532
Please, faster

879
01:20:06,568 --> 01:20:08,399
if l can't put out the soup
my other dishes can't go out

880
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:09,903
l'll wash you a bowl

881
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:10,927
Sorry

882
01:20:13,775 --> 01:20:14,366
Thanks

883
01:20:15,877 --> 01:20:17,401
Old Chu, l beg you please, faster

884
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:18,810
Coming...

885
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:23,948
Why do you keep sending out
the take-out orders?

886
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:25,919
There's guests at the tables
with nothing to eat!

887
01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:27,148
And a line around the block!

888
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:28,879
We can't put out the food

889
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:30,246
without dishes!

890
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:35,296
Yesterday at the employment agency
you said you had experience!

891
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:37,127
More or less

892
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:39,864
l'm running a business to make money

893
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:41,027
not to invite you for dinner

894
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:42,468
What do you mean more or less
This is less!

895
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:44,835
Yeah... don't get mad, l'm hurrying

896
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:47,770
You have to soak the honey banana
ball plates in hot water

897
01:20:47,809 --> 01:20:50,778
Don't just scrape them!

898
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:53,303
You break the plate, you pay for it!
Yes...

899
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:54,413
Hey, Boss

900
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:57,509
Do us a favor, let's quit selling
those dick-haired honey banana balls?

901
01:20:57,552 --> 01:20:59,816
lt's hard for us to make and
hard for him to wash. lt's not worth it

902
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,789
l'll decide if it's worth it

903
01:21:01,823 --> 01:21:04,121
lf you don't like making them
go work somewhere else

904
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:06,554
Just a good hearted suggestion

905
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:08,054
Thanks!

906
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:10,262
What are you three guys stuck here for?

907
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:11,026
Waiting for bowls

908
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:12,899
Can't you do something else
while you wait?

909
01:21:12,934 --> 01:21:14,231
Are your brain dead?

910
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:15,369
There's nothing else to do?!

911
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:16,835
Are the Mu Shu Pork pancakes steamed?

912
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:17,896
ln the steamer

913
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:18,496
The pickled cabbage is out

914
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,905
The wontons are boiling

915
01:21:19,941 --> 01:21:21,875
the forks are cleaned

916
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:23,343
the tables are cleared
the checks are paid

917
01:21:57,279 --> 01:21:57,904
Chu

918
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,072
here's today's pay

919
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:01,573
Thank you

920
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:05,312
This isn't working out

921
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:06,654
Don't come tomorrow

922
01:22:06,988 --> 01:22:08,250
l'll find someone else

923
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:10,892
Boss he's going okay now

924
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:12,317
Enough

925
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:14,491
No Problem

926
01:22:14,996 --> 01:22:16,224
there were enough dishes

927
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:17,231
What do mean enough dishes, no problem?

928
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:19,529
lt was only after the dinner rush hour

929
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:21,899
that thing returned to normal

930
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:24,030
Don't be pleading for him
because he's old

931
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:27,668
Lots of young guys
would fight for the chance

932
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:29,609
to make 700 dollars a month
washing dishes

933
01:22:29,644 --> 01:22:30,975
Why should l have an old man?

934
01:22:31,012 --> 01:22:32,912
l'm not running an old folks home

935
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:36,245
Boss, please give me another chance

936
01:22:36,318 --> 01:22:38,718
We all have to start somewhere. Right?

937
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:44,021
Okay... One more chance

938
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:45,026
Thank you

939
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:14,874
ls Sargeant Warren there?

940
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:18,712
lt's Alex Chu... yes

941
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:21,076
No?

942
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:28,121
Thanks Sargeant. Bye bye

943
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:50,910
Linda. lt's Alex

944
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:56,276
Let's have a talk... about the house

945
01:26:00,855 --> 01:26:05,155
Hey, congratulations on your review:
A bold new voice in women's fiction

946
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:06,217
Better late then never

947
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:08,559
l'm really proud of you, although

948
01:26:08,596 --> 01:26:11,656
it makes me feel like l should quit
my job and become a painter

949
01:26:13,935 --> 01:26:16,165
ln the meantime, all l do is eat

950
01:26:16,304 --> 01:26:17,271
Maybe you're pregnant

951
01:26:18,373 --> 01:26:21,536
Sure, if you believe
in immaculate conception

952
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:26,143
l'm even thinking of going to my high
school reunion to see

953
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:27,876
if there are any aging jocks
still available

954
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:28,706
Linda

955
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:33,817
Well at least l have my work
How's yours going?

956
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:35,380
Two chapters this week

957
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:37,889
Oh, more travails of study pioneer women

958
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:40,589
Actually
l've written in a Chinese family

959
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:42,493
The father brought over to work
on the railroads

960
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:45,192
Don't tell me you miss the old geezer?

961
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:46,597
Of course not

962
01:26:47,168 --> 01:26:47,827
Runaway Grandpa

963
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:50,235
l'm gonna have nightmares
for the rest of my life

964
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:52,739
imagining his face
on the side of my milk cartons

965
01:26:53,308 --> 01:26:54,297
lt's sad

966
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,234
And Alex...

967
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:57,244
He blames you, does he?

968
01:26:57,445 --> 01:27:01,381
No, he's just anxious. l blame myself

969
01:27:08,957 --> 01:27:10,515
How can l let you do this?

970
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:12,423
You'd better do your own work

971
01:27:12,794 --> 01:27:14,318
Don't worry about me

972
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:15,920
Once l get busy
l won't be able to help you anyway

973
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:18,192
Wu, thanks a lot

974
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:19,598
but everyone's got work to do

975
01:27:19,634 --> 01:27:21,659
Don't treat me special. l'll manage

976
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:25,603
Chu, this is for you, l got someone

977
01:27:26,307 --> 01:27:27,535
Boss, l've been doing all right

978
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:34,440
Eight bowls, five plates

979
01:27:34,816 --> 01:27:35,976
it's only 6:30p.m.

980
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:37,818
You need those two to help you

981
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:39,277
What happens at 7:30

982
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:42,016
when the guests
are lined up outside the door?

983
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:44,521
He didn't ask for help
we volunteered

984
01:27:44,726 --> 01:27:46,387
You volunteered, fine!
He asked for help, fine!

985
01:27:46,427 --> 01:27:48,691
l don't care
l can't take any risks tonight

986
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:51,290
Liu go downstairs
and get yourself an apron

987
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:54,761
Here's ten dollars
take it or leave it

988
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:57,600
Boss, why do you have to treat
an old man this way?

989
01:27:58,006 --> 01:27:59,871
l'll wash faster

990
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:03,207
Not just faster but clean too!

991
01:28:03,244 --> 01:28:05,235
Come on, cut the crap, go!

992
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,475
This is money

993
01:28:08,249 --> 01:28:09,273
Have you heard that before?

994
01:28:10,685 --> 01:28:12,778
Probably not, being from the mainland

995
01:28:13,388 --> 01:28:15,913
l know everything's shared there
working more gets you nothing

996
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:18,790
Four decades of such thinking produced

997
01:28:18,826 --> 01:28:19,656
all you lazy bums

998
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:22,690
Who are you calling a lazy bums?

999
01:28:23,831 --> 01:28:25,492
Eh? What's wrong? You don't accept that?

1000
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:28,368
Then go back to China and live off
your relatives. Go on!

1001
01:28:28,436 --> 01:28:29,528
No one's stopping you

1002
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:31,962
l'm telling you, this is America

1003
01:28:32,006 --> 01:28:33,530
There's no communal property

1004
01:28:33,574 --> 01:28:34,506
You have to earn everything

1005
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:36,567
yourself!

1006
01:28:36,644 --> 01:28:39,010
lf you want to be American
then why don't you go all the way

1007
01:28:39,047 --> 01:28:40,139
and buy dishwasher

1008
01:28:40,181 --> 01:28:41,478
lt'll wash faster and cleaner

1009
01:28:42,016 --> 01:28:46,009
Yeh! l'm offering you ten dollars

1010
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:47,885
because l respect your age

1011
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:49,785
l'm saving face for you

1012
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:51,018
if you don't want that

1013
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:52,350
l'll throw you out!

1014
01:28:53,461 --> 01:28:55,486
See if you can

1015
01:28:56,297 --> 01:28:58,424
Don't think l won't touch you
because you're old

1016
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:00,367
Come try me!

1017
01:29:00,802 --> 01:29:04,067
lf you can move me half a step
l won't say another word

1018
01:29:04,105 --> 01:29:06,039
l'll turn and leave

1019
01:29:06,307 --> 01:29:07,433
Don't

1020
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,375
So the old geezer knows kung-fu

1021
01:29:14,749 --> 01:29:16,808
No wonder you dared
be so arrogant with me!

1022
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:22,323
Oww! Li, Wu, help me!

1023
01:29:22,824 --> 01:29:23,848
l'm not getting involved in this

1024
01:29:24,926 --> 01:29:26,951
Cooks, Chang, Chien, get over here!

1025
01:29:27,061 --> 01:29:29,393
Boss, this is none of our business

1026
01:29:29,897 --> 01:29:31,387
Do you want to keep working here?

1027
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:33,764
Quick

1028
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,634
Old Chu, don't get angry

1029
01:29:41,676 --> 01:29:43,041
but we've all got families
to take care of

1030
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:45,143
We'll just move you half a step, okay?

1031
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:47,476
Then the business will keep going
Everyone, thank you

1032
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:49,983
Come on, careful now

1033
01:29:52,987 --> 01:29:53,885
Get him!

1034
01:29:54,922 --> 01:29:56,389
Liu, help out!

1035
01:29:56,424 --> 01:29:56,822
Wu, help!

1036
01:29:59,794 --> 01:30:00,954
Go and help

1037
01:30:21,716 --> 01:30:25,152
Chu, you're a hero. We can't move you

1038
01:30:25,186 --> 01:30:26,847
We brothers apologize

1039
01:30:28,456 --> 01:30:31,482
Boss Huang, we quit

1040
01:30:32,059 --> 01:30:37,122
Go find yourself some of those thick
skinned types with big muscles

1041
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:38,530
l can't take this

1042
01:30:40,535 --> 01:30:43,470
Hey, you can't all leave!

1043
01:30:44,872 --> 01:30:47,033
Okay! l'm calling
every employment agency!

1044
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:49,474
Don't think you'll work
in New York again!

1045
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:51,444
Fuck you You

1046
01:30:53,548 --> 01:30:55,880
All right tough guy!
The business is closed tonight

1047
01:30:55,917 --> 01:30:57,976
But l'm calling the cops on you!

1048
01:30:58,019 --> 01:31:00,886
l don't have a green card
You hired me illegally

1049
01:31:00,922 --> 01:31:02,446
They'll find you three thousand dollars

1050
01:31:02,824 --> 01:31:03,552
l'm telling you

1051
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:06,617
l'll move you without the cops!

1052
01:31:16,571 --> 01:31:18,562
Thank you, come again

1053
01:31:46,267 --> 01:31:49,134
Grab him! He's like an eel

1054
01:31:49,704 --> 01:31:50,671
He's like a slimy fish

1055
01:32:12,827 --> 01:32:14,761
Yeah, l've seen this kind before

1056
01:33:15,089 --> 01:33:17,284
Ten police officers
from the Fifth Precinct

1057
01:33:17,325 --> 01:33:21,659
were injured earlier this evening
in a brawl inside a Chinatown restaurant

1058
01:33:21,696 --> 01:33:22,856
Helen Wong reports

1059
01:33:23,831 --> 01:33:26,265
Shirley l'm standing
in front of the Lai Fu restaurant

1060
01:33:26,467 --> 01:33:27,365
The owner Frankie Huang

1061
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:30,666
tried to fire his 70-year old dishwasher
here earlier this evening

1062
01:33:30,738 --> 01:33:32,797
But Huang got more than he bargained for

1063
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:36,776
Because the man he tried to fire Mr. Chu
refused to leave the restaurant

1064
01:33:36,877 --> 01:33:37,536
Alex

1065
01:33:37,578 --> 01:33:39,842
Police said that
Mr. Chu is a Tai Chi master

1066
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:43,611
and he let lose a 1 30 pounds
of martial arts fury

1067
01:33:43,651 --> 01:33:45,846
And hurt over
a dozen of New York's finest

1068
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:50,184
Now it appears that Mr. Chu's being led
out of the restaurant by the police

1069
01:33:50,224 --> 01:33:55,628
and is being put into a squad car
and taken to the precinct and be arrested

1070
01:33:56,230 --> 01:34:00,064
Reporting live, Helen Wong
now back to you at the studio

1071
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:38,396
He's been like this
ever since he came in

1072
01:34:38,739 --> 01:34:40,730
The entire time he has been here

1073
01:34:40,775 --> 01:34:43,710
he hasn't said anything
nor has he eaten or drunk anything

1074
01:34:44,845 --> 01:34:48,645
l tell you l don't know
if he's meditating or sleeping

1075
01:34:55,823 --> 01:34:57,017
lf you don't mind me saying so Mr. Chu

1076
01:34:57,058 --> 01:34:59,390
it's... kind of depressing

1077
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:08,726
l'll let you go in and talk to him

1078
01:35:09,103 --> 01:35:09,933
Thank you officer

1079
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:11,296
Any time

1080
01:35:27,755 --> 01:35:28,779
Dad

1081
01:35:37,098 --> 01:35:41,000
Ah, attaining nothingness isn't easy

1082
01:35:43,771 --> 01:35:45,261
Dad, we've bought a new house

1083
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:47,132
it's much bigger than the old one

1084
01:35:48,476 --> 01:35:49,340
What for?

1085
01:35:50,711 --> 01:35:52,110
l'm here to take you home

1086
01:35:52,146 --> 01:35:54,979
Home? Whose home?

1087
01:35:56,717 --> 01:35:58,082
My home is your home!

1088
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:02,246
Forget it. l see clearly now

1089
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:05,724
the only thing that matters
is that you have a happy life

1090
01:36:06,327 --> 01:36:08,761
lf you want to show me
some filial respect

1091
01:36:10,097 --> 01:36:11,496
get me

1092
01:36:12,166 --> 01:36:16,296
an apartment in Chinatown

1093
01:36:17,304 --> 01:36:21,934
Let me peacefully pass my days there
disciplining my spirit

1094
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:24,800
ln your free time
bring the boy to see me

1095
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:27,247
This way when we get together

1096
01:36:28,816 --> 01:36:32,877
there'll still be some good feelings

1097
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:39,483
Dad

1098
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:42,756
all these years
l've studied and worked hard

1099
01:36:42,863 --> 01:36:44,922
and built my family

1100
01:36:45,766 --> 01:36:48,326
in order that one day
l could bring you to America

1101
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:51,864
so you could have some good days
in your life

1102
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:54,338
Dad!

1103
01:37:07,855 --> 01:37:10,119
Alex, can you give a hand up here?

1104
01:37:10,224 --> 01:37:12,522
Okay, coming up

1105
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:20,801
ls this straight?

1106
01:37:21,602 --> 01:37:22,796
Lower in the left

1107
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:25,032
Yeah, it's fine

1108
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:27,373
Do you think
he'll ever spend a night here?

1109
01:37:27,408 --> 01:37:31,071
Oh, yes. As long as Jeremy is here
Grandpa will visit

1110
01:37:31,278 --> 01:37:33,269
Jeremy wants to be a Tai Chi master

1111
01:37:33,314 --> 01:37:35,544
Why didn't you ever learn
any Tai Chi from your father?

1112
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:39,246
You know, for Dad
Tai Chi was a way to escape from reality

1113
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,787
Even when he did pushing hands, for him

1114
01:37:42,823 --> 01:37:44,848
it was a way to avoid other people

1115
01:37:45,092 --> 01:37:45,922
Pushing hands?

1116
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:49,461
Yeah, it's like Tai Chi for two

1117
01:37:50,898 --> 01:37:52,957
A way of keeping your balance

1118
01:37:53,067 --> 01:37:54,967
while unbalancing your opponent

1119
01:37:55,002 --> 01:37:57,368
Like marriage... only kidding

1120
01:37:57,838 --> 01:37:59,328
Okay, you stand like this...

1121
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:02,433
Balanced? Yup

1122
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:04,477
lf you try to unbalance me

1123
01:38:04,511 --> 01:38:06,342
l simply avoid your energy

1124
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:08,143
and turn it back on you

1125
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:13,984
Relax

1126
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:19,252
Don't resist and don't break contact

1127
01:38:21,929 --> 01:38:23,021
Feel it?

1128
01:38:24,965 --> 01:38:27,365
Step out and collect

1129
01:38:27,668 --> 01:38:31,069
Moving up on left

1130
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:35,672
Collect and moving up

1131
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:37,873
Turn to right

1132
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:41,939
Hugging your back

1133
01:38:41,982 --> 01:38:44,644
Hand down

1134
01:38:45,619 --> 01:38:47,610
Turn back and attack

1135
01:38:48,422 --> 01:38:50,617
Get back

1136
01:38:50,658 --> 01:38:53,320
Spread your legs

1137
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:56,523
Get in

1138
01:38:57,564 --> 01:38:58,428
Squat down

1139
01:38:59,233 --> 01:39:02,691
Collect

1140
01:39:04,004 --> 01:39:06,029
Swing hands and step forward

1141
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:08,633
Moving forward

1142
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:13,072
Get in and spread your fingers

1143
01:39:13,981 --> 01:39:15,972
Step back and collect

1144
01:39:16,984 --> 01:39:18,975
Hook

1145
01:39:19,553 --> 01:39:20,952
Get in

1146
01:39:21,922 --> 01:39:23,412
Sweep

1147
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:27,420
Turn hands

1148
01:39:28,595 --> 01:39:29,994
Single whip

1149
01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:36,567
Very good...

1150
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:41,733
Relax, relax your whole body

1151
01:39:52,052 --> 01:39:54,714
Relax your hip and lower down

1152
01:39:57,224 --> 01:39:59,055
Relax...

1153
01:40:00,461 --> 01:40:03,089
Good, raise your arms up

1154
01:40:03,964 --> 01:40:05,397
Relax little
and eyes looking in the distance

1155
01:40:05,599 --> 01:40:09,000
Mrs. Chen, long time no see

1156
01:40:09,103 --> 01:40:11,094
You've come a long way to buy groceries

1157
01:40:11,138 --> 01:40:12,765
No, not far. l live in the area

1158
01:40:13,741 --> 01:40:14,935
Your daughter moved?

1159
01:40:14,975 --> 01:40:16,135
No, l moved

1160
01:40:16,977 --> 01:40:19,741
That's great!
Living on your own, you're free

1161
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:21,213
You can do whatever you want

1162
01:40:22,182 --> 01:40:24,514
l just finished shopping

1163
01:40:24,551 --> 01:40:27,611
saw it was early
and decided to stop by your class

1164
01:40:27,988 --> 01:40:30,081
How did you know l was teaching here?

1165
01:40:31,358 --> 01:40:33,121
Wow! Who doesn't know
about the hero old Mr. Chu

1166
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:35,025
famous all over Chinatown

1167
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:37,592
The TV news showed that you knocked flat

1168
01:40:37,631 --> 01:40:40,065
a gang of American police
and Chinese hoodlums

1169
01:40:41,668 --> 01:40:42,965
From what l can see if

1170
01:40:43,003 --> 01:40:44,971
Tai Chi Chuan
could be practised upside down

1171
01:40:45,005 --> 01:40:46,472
the ceiling of this old age centre

1172
01:40:46,507 --> 01:40:48,771
would be packed with your students

1173
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:51,341
You're making fun of me!

1174
01:40:51,412 --> 01:40:53,039
l'm speaking the truth

1175
01:40:54,014 --> 01:40:54,708
did you make a fortune?

1176
01:40:55,449 --> 01:40:56,279
No way

1177
01:40:56,750 --> 01:41:00,516
Every morning l come here
and pass the time with the students

1178
01:41:01,655 --> 01:41:03,122
Anyway we old folks

1179
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:06,618
have nothing but time to kill

1180
01:41:07,027 --> 01:41:09,621
l earn my own money

1181
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:10,822
and don't take anybody's flack

1182
01:41:11,365 --> 01:41:13,993
That's why l always say

1183
01:41:14,034 --> 01:41:16,264
you can't hold everything inside

1184
01:41:16,303 --> 01:41:18,828
Sometimes you've got to lose your temper
to straighten things out

1185
01:41:19,106 --> 01:41:21,301
The kids are grown up

1186
01:41:22,042 --> 01:41:24,340
lf we old folks don't
take care of ourselves

1187
01:41:24,378 --> 01:41:25,538
who will?

1188
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:28,173
You're right

1189
01:41:29,249 --> 01:41:31,080
ls your shoulder better?

1190
01:41:31,151 --> 01:41:32,743
Better?

1191
01:41:33,087 --> 01:41:34,714
At my age, l just thank the heavens

1192
01:41:34,755 --> 01:41:36,222
that it doesn't get worse

1193
01:41:37,057 --> 01:41:38,319
l don't know kung-fu like you

1194
01:41:40,494 --> 01:41:42,189
But is it convenient living alone?

1195
01:41:43,363 --> 01:41:44,057
lt's all right

1196
01:41:45,365 --> 01:41:47,128
My daughter comes to see me every two
or three weeks

1197
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:50,261
when she goes shopping around here

1198
01:41:50,704 --> 01:41:52,228
she cooks and eats with me

1199
01:41:53,273 --> 01:41:57,300
Uhhhh. That's good. Alex
and his family do the same

1200
01:42:11,091 --> 01:42:12,353
You'd better take care of your students
l'm leaving now

1201
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:14,422
When you're free, stop by

1202
01:42:15,195 --> 01:42:17,663
We're neighbours now

1203
01:42:17,698 --> 01:42:19,290
Well, take care

1204
01:42:20,167 --> 01:42:20,690
You too

1205
01:42:47,895 --> 01:42:48,657
Mrs. Chen!

1206
01:42:51,498 --> 01:42:52,465
Why did you come out?

1207
01:42:53,734 --> 01:42:55,258
To see if you had left

1208
01:42:56,136 --> 01:42:58,400
The sun is so pleasant today

1209
01:42:58,639 --> 01:42:59,697
l was thinking, l'm just one person

1210
01:42:59,873 --> 01:43:03,138
l could go home or stay out
both would be good

1211
01:43:03,177 --> 01:43:05,577
Anyway, standing here
l got lost in thought

1212
01:43:05,746 --> 01:43:06,542
Where do you live?

1213
01:43:07,247 --> 01:43:09,340
l live in that building, number 1068

1214
01:43:10,217 --> 01:43:13,152
l live in that building, number 20101

1215
01:43:14,555 --> 01:43:15,749
Stop by for a visit sometime

1216
01:43:17,324 --> 01:43:18,552
Do you have anything
to do this afternoon?

1217
01:43:20,294 --> 01:43:24,424
Uh... Nothing
