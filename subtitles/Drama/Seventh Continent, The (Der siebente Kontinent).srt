2
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:15,225
Monsters around,
but they ain't scaring me.

3
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:22,058
In the land of sand
where they only speak Arabi.

4
00:00:24,294 --> 00:00:26,975
Far from home,
I know they'd be missing me.

5
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,725
My girl on the phone

6
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:34,766
dreaming a kiss of me.

7
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:37,933
Out here with Sergeant Forrest,

8
00:00:38,183 --> 00:00:39,600
but he ain't no gump.

9
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:43,808
Got the rifle in the hand
to make a million mammals jump.

10
00:00:46,183 --> 00:00:49,350
I'm from the D, man, you know,
the poets and thugs.

11
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:52,736
Lay it down like a king,

12
00:00:53,574 --> 00:00:55,778
catching giant sand bugs.

13
00:00:55,779 --> 00:01:15,000
