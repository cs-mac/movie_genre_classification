1
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,964

2
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,448
You want to sleep
with Mommy tonight?

3
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,568
Mm-hm. In my bed?

4
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,926
Mm-hm.

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,207
You promise not to kick me?

6
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,602
I promise.
Yeah, okay.

7
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,604
Shall I sing to you? Yeah.

8
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,523
Yeah?
Mm-hm.

9
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,364
What song?

10
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,568
One of your songs.

11
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,168
Oh, well, sugar, those aren't really
meant to put people to sleep.

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,281
What did you sing me
when I was little?

13
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,364
Um, like, you know,
Rock-a-bye Baby.

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,244
That's for babies.

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,243
So?

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,642
<i>When the wind blows
The cradle will rock</i>

17
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,644
<i>When the bough breaks
The cradle will fall</i>

18
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,441
<i>Down will come baby
Cradle and all.</i>

19
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,371
Are you sleepy?
A little.

20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,046
Why don't you just close
your eyes and try, okay?

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,691
Okay.. Okay..

22
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,524

23
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,682
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

24
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,603
I'll help you fall asleep.

25
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,207
<i>Rock-a-bye baby</i>

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,080
<i>On the tree top</i>

27
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,801
<i>When the wind blows</i>

28
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,124
<i>The cradle will rock</i>

29
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,001
<i>When the bough breaks</i>

30
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,722
<i>The cradle will fall</i>

31
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,243
<i>And down Will come baby</i>

32
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,450
<i>Cradle and all</i>

33
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,849

34
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,047

35
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,083
Pizza man.

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,365
Hi.

37
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,284
Hi. Can you sign this, please?

38
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,562
Sure.
Wait for me.

39
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,122

40
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,083
Pizza man's here.

41
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,044

42
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,961
You haven't done anything!
You haven't had a creative
thought in your life.

43
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,327
What have you done in
the last five years?

44
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,131
How jealous you are.
I'm jealous?

45
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,407

46
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,644
There's your tip.
Thanks.

47
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,610
You're welcome.
Goodnight.

48
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,531

49
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,887
I've.. I've done my mid-life crisis.

50
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,644
You should get on with yours.
What?

51
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,883
You should get on with your mid-life crisis...
Don't talk to me about ...

52
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,167

53
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,962
You want to play Tic-tac-toe?

54
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,202
Sure.

55
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,442
Why don't we eat outside?

56
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,329
Okay?

57
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,971
Yes, go walk away.
Walk away like you always do.

58
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,570
Hey,... can I have some pizza?

59
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,808
S u r e.
Eh heh.

60
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,085
Mmm. Nice!

61
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,242
Tic-tac-toe.
Look, I won.

62
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,005
Come on Maisie, you didn't let me play.

63
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,650
Oow... Look at me.

64
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,888
You're cheating.

65
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,928
Maisie, ...

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,288
do you ever wonder what
Margo thinks of us ...

67
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,045
behind that hauntingly calm exterior.

68
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,722

69
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,565
Okay. Enjoy!

70
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,369
Do you want to be "Xs" or "Os"?

71
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,489
Um, I want to be "Os".

72
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,045
<i>The ants go marching one by one.</i>

73
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,851
<i>Hurrah, hurrah.</i>

74
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,651
<i>The ants go marching one by one.</i>

75
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,451
<i>The little one stops to suck his thumb.</i>

76
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,488

77
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,644

78
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,722
You're a liar and a thief!

79
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,962
This is a colossal waste of time. 
Fine, go!

80
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,122

81
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,767
Hey.
Hi.

82
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,971

83
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,044

84
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,804
Susanna.

85
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,962
Is that Daddy?

86
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,247
Shhh, go back to sleep.

87
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,891

88
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,885
Open the door!

89
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,769

90
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,808
Open the damn door!
Damn!

91
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,965

92
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,451
Stop making that fucking noise!

93
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,726
They hate me in this building.

94
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,609
Oh, there you are!

95
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,250
At last.

96
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,641
Open the door!

97
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,211
Susanna.
Go away!

98
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,203
Open the door!

99
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,320
No!

100
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,562
Open the fucking door!

101
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,246
Not this time! 
I told you it would happen if you left!

102
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,049
What?
Are you serious?

103
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,963
Yes, I'm serious.
It's my apartment.

104
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,690
Open the goddamn door!
No!

105
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,330

106
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,801
You're a fucking headcase!
Fuck you!

107
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,885
Now, remember your soil 
should be damp,

108
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,645
not soaked.

109
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,446

110
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,003
You father's here!

111
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,163
Maybe your dog died.

112
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,924
I don't have a dog.

113
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,083
Yah, well you're never gonna lose money ...

114
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,128
... on art, unless you overpay!

115
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,964
This is a good price. So, ...

116
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,010
what I need to know... if you aah...
if you want the paintings ...

117
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,731
... I need to know ASAP.
Let me just get rid of this call.

118
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,370
One second.

119
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,249
Here is this month's schedule.

120
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,482
We would prefer if you'd
wait the few extra minutes

121
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,164
until the end of the school day

122
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,844
so that we don't have to interrupt class.

123
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,729
Okay. Okay, ... I'll make sure ...

124
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,087
... that it doesn't happen again.

125
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,209
Listen, why don't you and me go and
get ourselves a nice double espresso?

126
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,044
With Mommy?

127
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,168
No, no, just you and me this time.
Eeh? Fun, huh?

128
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,447
Hey, so they're exemplary pieces ...

129
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,524
Are you kidding me! What were you going to do?
Take her to Argentina?

130
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,843
I'll call you back. People, just ...
do I need to get some help?

131
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,810
No. This is not a game, Beale.
Come on, baby.

132
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,201
Daddy's not going
to pick you up anymore.

133
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,328
I'm just going to pick you up, okay?
Are you okay?

134
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,602
It's okay. I'm only her father.

135
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,004
Wow, Pooh, you have
your own TV?

136
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,367
Yeah, we can watch it later.

137
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,680
Hey, cool. A little monkey.

138
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,444
What a lovely room.
Thanks.

139
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,965
Need anything before I go?

140
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,805
No, I'm all set, thanks.
Bye.

141
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,965
Zoey, I want you to listen to Maisie's
mother, otherwise I'm going to come back ...

142
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,042
and there's not going to be
a sleepover, all right?

143
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,925
Okay! 
Look!

144
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,004
Still wrapping.
Ooh. Yah.

145
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,811
Okay, cup cake on the crown.

146
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,963
Icing. Icing really hot.
You got it guys?

147
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,724
You got the icing?

148
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,167
Oh, candy.
Oh, candy.

149
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,651
Woooooo!

150
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,688

151
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,569
Look at that slide.
Slowmo.. move.

152
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,120

153
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,644
Now, put your ...

154
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,449
fourth one on me.

155
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,363

156
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,122
Oops, sorry.

157
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,885

158
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,726
Look. It's red, white, and green.

159
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,131
Wow! Cool.

160
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,565
Let's go back inside.

161
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,166
Hey, listen to this.
You guys hear that?

162
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,242
I love how he waits back on the beat.

163
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,163
Yeah, get down.

164
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,844
Yeah.
That's you.

165
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,611
Yeah, yeah, I heard, it's good. Yeah.

166
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,249
I'm going to find
a whiskey.

167
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,721
<i>Hook and line
I still blow away</i>

168
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,162
<i>With your Hook and
line I still blow away</i>

169
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:29,840
<i>With your Hook and
line I still blow away</i>

170
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,242
<i>With your Hook and
line I still blow away</i>

171
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,248
<i>With your Hook and
line I still blow away</i>

172
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,447

173
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,124
Zoey.

174
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,288
Don't cry, Zoey.

175
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,085
Ooh.

176
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,367
Aah, this is the heart line.

177
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,048
And you're gonna...
... you're going to meet
a very interesting man.

178
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,451
Extraordinary.

179
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,210
Oh, hey. You're back.

180
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,964
Hon, you're supposed to be in bed.

181
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,964
Zoey's crying.

182
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,729
Ooh!
I'm really sorry.

183
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,450
Hey, at this age ...

184
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,285
Yeah, you know, at
this age they don't ...

185
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,886
Um. All right!

186
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,644
Thanks for coming.

187
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,371
Goodnight.
Go.

188
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,011
Bye, Zoey.
Bye.

189
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,560
Bye, Zoey.

190
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,483
Go back to bed,
baby, okay?

191
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,769
So much for them testifying for me.

192
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,127
Fuck it.

193
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,521
The mom's a total Nazi anyway.

194
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,489

195
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,209
Okay, Maisie,
come on, which one?

196
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,846
That one.

197
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,320
You dressed yet?

198
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,801
We don't have time for that!
We're late.

199
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,087
Here.
Put these on!

200
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,851
Okay.

201
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,126
You can definitely mention
the time he threw you.

202
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,884
He did?
Oh, my God, yeah.

203
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,644
He threw you across the room

204
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,961
onto the couch, and was
yelling in your face.

205
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,088
Jesus.
Don't you remember?

206
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,243
It was like your most
earth-shattering moment.

207
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,331
Maisie?

208
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,324
Do you and your mom
sing together sometimes?

209
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,243
Sometimes.

210
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,731
Is it fun?

211
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,088

212
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,611
Well, it is what it is.

213
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,649
I hope you get what a farce this is.

214
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,529
I mean it's ridiculous.
We're not even married.

215
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,728
And listen, you know,
whatever he says ...

216
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,007
... be sure to factor in thirty
years of substance abuse.

217
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,681
Do you want the chicken?
Uh-huh.

218
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,603
Okay. Might be
a little bit spicy.

219
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,851

220
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,843
How does that happen?

221
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,046

222
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,884
Here you go.

223
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,724

224
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,847
Hello?

225
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,689
If you think it's all right.

226
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,003
Your Dad's coming up.

227
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,686
Heeey!

228
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,246
Oh, my sixth favorite girl.

229
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,810
Who's your other girls?

230
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,291
Oh, I can't tell you about those.

231
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,328
Why not?
It's a secret.

232
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,404
Do you want some Mandarin chicken?

233
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,921
Mmm, that sounds good.
Hi.
Hey.

234
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,963
I think she's coming back soon.
I know.

235
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,122
I'm just going to grab a few
things and then we'll, uh, ...

236
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,884
... we'll keep this our little secret.

237
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,247
Don't want to get Margo
decapitated, no?

238
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,049
Uh..uh.

239
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,531
Okay.

240
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,967
Okay, I got to dash.

241
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,169
But, uh, don't worry.
I'm uh, fixing things, okay?

242
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,045
And, uuh, thank you.

243
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,929
You're one in a million.

244
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,604

245
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,051
Hey.

246
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,804
Shit! Okay, thanks.
You're a prince.

247
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,690
That's Byron downstairs.
She's on her way up. So...

248
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,728
Ooh...

249
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,247
Hey. Up, up, up!
Come on.

250
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,482
The doors don't open
until ten after eight.

251
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,166
I've got to be at court
in 15 minutes.

252
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,681
All right, I guess you can leave her.
Thanks.

253
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,762
Love you.

254
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,326
My mum says you're
supposed to come with me.

255
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,081
To your house? Nah, we're
going to walk you home.

256
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,646
Bye.
Bye.

257
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,531
Hi, Maisie.

258
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,806
Hi, Byron.

259
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,807

260
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,008
You're not capable
of taking care of a child.

261
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,282
You know better.
No, I know you.

262
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,362
Really?
Yes, yes.

263
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,283
I know you.

264
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,840
No, Susanna, you don't know
anyone except yourself.
Shut up!

265
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,163
You breathe pain wherever you go.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

266
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,369
That's why the judge and
the expert, they saw that.

267
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,442
They saw you.
No! No!

268
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,443
Then why are they not
giving you sole custody?

269
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,727
Because you got a female
judge, that's why.

270
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,087
If that's what you want to
tell yourself, then fine.

271
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,004
If you want to tell your delude self.
Don't take her, man.
I'm not taking her.

272
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,646
Don't take her. I'm not taking her.
They gave her to me.

273
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,409
Hey.
Hey, baby.

274
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,209
Just the person
we want to see.

275
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,686
Honey, why don't you get
some clothes and things ...

276
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,285
... and stuff to take with us?

277
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,208
Do it!

278
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,086
It's okay.
It's okay.

279
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,609
She doesn't need you telling her
what I say is okay, asshole!

280
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,001
Temper, temper.

281
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,800

282
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,042
There you go.

283
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,603
I'm right behind you.

284
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,602
Hi, Maisie.
Hi.

285
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,609
Can I take your bag?

286
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,609
You want to see your room?

287
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,450

288
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,370
So! What do you think?

289
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,127

290
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,246
You know, you have Margo to thank ...

291
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,927
for... most of this stuff.

292
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,005
Why don't I let you two catch
up on world events?

293
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,129

294
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,209
So, ...

295
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,521
... you surprised
to see me?

296
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,604
It's kind of funny, huh?

297
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,321
Hello. Hello.

298
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,643
Hello. Hello.

299
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,882
How much?

300
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,443
That's academic. Look, no one
in America has heard of him.

301
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,170
I don't know why but ...

302
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,924
Fine, okay, let's see.

303
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,764
Okay, bye.

304
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,929
You can write
in straight lines.

305
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,088
You got it.

306
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,961
I may need to take off to
Italy in the next few weeks.

307
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,088
Ooh.

308
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,528
So, you think you could,
uh, keep an eye on Maisie?

309
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,571
Okay. Sure.

310
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,803
Go on, start again. You know you're only
supposed to do the first letter, right?

311
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,884
Your passport's in order, right? So...

312
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,367
Mine?
Uh-huh.

313
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,851
Uh-huh.

314
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,321
Good. Aah.

315
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,607
Because this work should
only take a few days.

316
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,365
I thought after that maybe we
could go on a little cruise ...

317
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,171
... in the Aeolian Islands, ...

318
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,164
you know, say something like that.

319
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,722
Yeah. I've never been to Italy.

320
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,006
Ooh.

321
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,684
Or on a boat.

322
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,525
Right, great. Well,
then, that's good.

323
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,803
- We'll do that. 
- We're going on a boat? When?

324
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,009
Well, don't start packing
just yet, okay?

325
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,320
It's all depending.

326
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,169

327
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,602

328
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,721
What's all this?

329
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,928
Aah.. I got a flower delivery
for Maisie Beale.

330
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,082
Let me see. Uh..

331
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,561
That's just ... This is
totally inappropriate.

332
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,847
Give.. Give them back
to the delivery guy.

333
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,126
The guy already left.

334
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,800
Okay, I'll take it.

335
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,325

336
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,246

337
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,968
Ten minutes and then
homework, okay?

338
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,690
Okay.

339
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,326
Sweetie?

340
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,765
What are these?

341
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,643
I don't know.

342
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,451
But, I mean, did you
put them in there?

343
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,165
Maisie?

344
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,129
Mommy sent them.

345
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,170
Oh.

346
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,924
Well, we should put them
in some water.

347
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,606
Can't I just keep them
in the closet?

348
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,370
Why?

349
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,761
'Cause Daddy
threw them out.

350
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,968
Oh.

351
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,327
He's allergic.

352
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,129
Really?

353
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,807
I'll tell you what.

354
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,521
Why don't we press a few, and
then you can keep them forever?

355
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,251
And that'll be our little secret, okay?

356
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,644
Okay. Why don't you pick
some of your favorites?

357
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,245
Okay.

358
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,448
I like this one.

359
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,847
This one. Okay, here's our book.

360
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,531
And this one.

361
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,924
When we go back to Mommy's, can
we bring Starbrite's corral?

362
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,924
Um, sweetie, I'm not
going with you.

363
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,964
Oh.

364
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,008
I'll be here when you get back.

365
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,845
Okay.

366
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,400
So, where do we put the flowers?
In the middle?

367
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,562
You put them in this side.

368
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,487
Gently.

369
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,360
You know, your Daddy's sad
when you're not here, right?

370
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,407
So, um, ...

371
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,801
it's nice for him
to have someone around

372
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,929
to... cheer him up.

373
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,049
And do the shopping
and everything, too.

374
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,930
So, since
we like each other,

375
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,368
we thought that maybe
I could do that.

376
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,082
How does that sound?

377
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,081
Good.

378
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,163
Let's do another.
Okay.

379
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,442
I think the roses
would be too big.

380
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,649
Yeah.
That one's nice.

381
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,767
Try that one.

382
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,730

383
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,451
Oh, my baby,
I missed you so much.

384
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,124
I missed you, too.

385
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,804
Look.

386
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,281
Jesus.

387
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,328
Jesus, how did that happen?

388
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,448
I touched my arm on the stove ...

389
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,284
and I got burned and I cried.

390
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,124
I bet you did.

391
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,044
I bet that hurt.

392
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,125
How did it happen? Did Daddy let
you cook by yourself or something?

393
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,601
Oh, God.
Okay.

394
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,887
The court says that I'm not
supposed to say anything, ...

395
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,169
but I would be, like, totally
negligent if I didn't tell you ...

396
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,890
that you really 
have to watch yourself ...

397
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,610
when you're alone
with Daddy, okay?

398
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,250
Margo was there.

399
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,368
Margo?
You mean, ...

400
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,010
you mean our Margo?

401
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,606
Margo who was at our house?
That Margo?

402
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,563

403
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,327
You have a nice room at Daddy's?

404
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,528
Uh-huh, I have a canopy bed.

405
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,008
Oh, that's nice.

406
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,163
Does Margo have a nice room?

407
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,767
It's tiny, and when you look out
the window, there's a wall.

408
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,447
Ooh, Daddy must not like her very much
if he gives her a room like that.

409
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,045
He likes her.

410
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,885
Yeah?

411
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,645
Does he ... Does he give her a kiss?

412
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,007
Anything like that? Show
her how much he likes her?

413
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,210
I don't know.
No?

414
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,691
No, huh?

415
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,925
Yes, yes, I'm sure. She just told me.
Hang on a second.

416
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,048
Hey, baby, go play in your
room for a little bit.

417
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,521
I'm going to finish
this phone call, okay?

418
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,883
No, he's got her living with him.

419
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,009
What do you think I want? I want you
to take that asshole back to court ...

420
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,082
... and get me sole custody.

421
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,481

422
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,811
Maisie?

423
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,723
Careful, Maisie.

424
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,450
Why would you be afraid of her?

425
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,927
I mean, alright, maybe she
looks a little funny, ...

426
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,844
but that's, like,
really narrow minded.

427
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,888
And I don't want you to grow up
to be one of those people

428
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,531
'cause it's just not cool.

429
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,410
And you know what? She's the kind
of nanny you're supposed to have.

430
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,881
I mean, she's not some tramp
with a Daddy fixation.

431
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,607
She smells funny. 
She does not smell funny.

432
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,648
That's the way a nanny
is supposed to smell.

433
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,721
Come on.

434
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,609
Okay.

435
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,884
Bullshit! That's ridiculous. Why do I even bother.

436
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,407
Come on, Maisie, let's go.

437
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,925
Get your stuff, sweetie.

438
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,089
Hey, turn around.

439
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,884
You're going to see him soon enough.
 I will?

440
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,968
You're going to be a flower girl.
I am?

441
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,407
Yeah, there's nothing
he won't do.

442
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,643
Here comes the fucking bride.

443
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,326

444
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,370
The collar is sticking
up a little bit there.

445
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,647
Yeah, good. Good.

446
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,007

447
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,888

448
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,209
Mrs. Beale, this is Principal
Fairchild-Tettenbaum.

449
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,204
This is my third message. I
would appreciate a call back.

450
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,805
Thank you.

451
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,884
Maisie, are you sure
your mother knows ...

452
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,564
she's supposed to pick you up?

453
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,682
I don't know.
All right.

454
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,171
I'll figure something out.

455
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,804
Oh, Maisie.

456
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,168
I thought that Maisie 's mother was
supposed to be doing pick up today.

457
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,925
She is. If my husband hadn't checked
his messages at the airport, ...

458
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,800
we'd be on a plane. I'm
supposed to be on my honeymoon.

459
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,089
Hey, excuse me.
Is this, uh ...

460
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,130
Susanna Nun. She sent
me to get her daughter.

461
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,690
Who are you?

462
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,570
Uh, I'm her, uh, ...

463
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,483
sort of like Maisie's stepfather.

464
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,645
You're what? Yeah, I'm
married to Susanna.

465
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,367
Hey.

466
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,602
How... how are you, Maisie?
I'm Lincoln.

467
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,082
Do you remember me ? We met
before a few weeks ago.

468
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,561
Remember that?
This is ...

469
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,723
We don't just release children to
anyone walking into the office.

470
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,407
Um, no, of course, no.

471
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,768
So, I've got Maisie, and
I don't know what to do, ...

472
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,888
so can you please call me back?

473
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,004
I can't get hold of him.

474
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,048
Would you want to call Susanna?

475
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,202
Just if you want to make
sure I'm not some random ...

476
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,203
I'm not going to call Susanna.

477
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,169
Why don't you call her?

478
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,050
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I can call.

479
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,640
Hey, it's me.

480
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,563
Yeah, no, it's good.

481
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,483
I'm aah outside the school
here with Maisie, ...

482
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,166
and Margo is here.

483
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,129
I understand.

484
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,248
Yeah, well, she doesn't
really know who I am.

485
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,761
Yeah, all right.
Just one second.

486
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,446
Uh, it's Susanna.

487
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,806
Hello?

488
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,648
Yes.

489
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,449
I heard you.

490
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,168
Okay, so I'll just take Maisie ...

491
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,651
Huh.. hello?

492
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,087
Susanna?
Hello?

493
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,124
Okay.

494
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,051
Uh, I guess that's done.

495
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,724
Yeah, I guess.

496
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,086
I've got to go.

497
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,400
You need a cab?
Yeah.

498
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,807
I'll get.. I'll get you one.

499
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,769
Hey, taxi.

500
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,170
Hi.

501
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,569
Okay, Maisie, I'll
see you in ten days.

502
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,802
I don't want you to go.

503
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,201
It'll be okay, okay?

504
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,362
I promise.

505
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,930
I have to go.

506
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,769
I don't want to go with him.

507
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,842
Oh, Maisie.

508
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,521
I really, really love you. Okay?

509
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,011
Okay.

510
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,082
See you in ten days, okay?

511
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,446
Bye, sweetie.

512
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,568
Have a nice honeymoon.

513
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,523
Bye, Maisie.

514
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,722
Please say bye.

515
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,043
JFK, please.

516
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,171
Yeah, we should probably wait.

517
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,964
She's lost it.

518
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,566
No, we need some more.

519
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,120
Oh, I'll be back.
Baby just came home.

520
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,728
Ooh, I have to kiss you.

521
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,648
Mommy?
Yeah?

522
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,121
Did you really get married?

523
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,682
Uh..huh. But I still love you the best.

524
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,162
And I'm still your mommy, right?

525
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,483
And, you know, he's just... he's
just like a friend.

526
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,483
You don't have to call
him Daddy or anything.

527
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:16,088
Just like... just like you don't
call Margo mommy, right?

528
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,925
You can just call him Lincoln.

529
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,480
Did you have a flower girl?

530
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,121
Oh, you know what? If we
did, it would've been you.

531
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,487
But we kept it really low key, ...

532
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,844
and, um, it was just like with a
Justice of the Peace kind of thing.

533
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,126
We didn't even have a cake.

534
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,441
No cake?
No cake.

535
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,488
Sad but true.

536
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,086
Here, want to see something?

537
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,527
You want to see what he gave me?
Look at this.

538
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,807
Look at that.
It's tiny.

539
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,370
It is tiny, isn't it?

540
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,761
Tiny, tiny, little one.

541
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,561
There.
Hey.

542
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,409
Hey.
Sorry.

543
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,369
It's okay.
Come on in.

544
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,727
Well I.. I got to go to work actually.

545
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,484
Okay.

546
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,642
Aah, It was nice seeing you again, Maisie.

547
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,524
Say goodbye to Lincoln.

548
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,171
Bye.
Bye.

549
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,447
Look how tall he is.
He's so tall.

550
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,611
Does he always work at night?
Yeah.

551
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,160
He's pretty much just a bartender,
but you know, whatever.

552
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,971
It's good, so when I'm
working, he can watch you.

553
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,883
It'll be good.

554
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,442
Can I tell you a secret?

555
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,603
I married him for you.

556
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,562
I married him for you.

557
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,729

558
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,051
<i>Sleep tight on the night train.</i>

559
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,690
<i>No pain.</i>

560
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,001
<i>I don't remember...</i>

561
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,447
<i>for a couple of years.</i>

562
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,329
<i>Did some good for you</i>

563
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,129
<i>No, your eyes...</i>

564
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,804
Hey, it's too thin.

565
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,450
I want to do a couple more,

566
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,722
and then I want to
hear it doubled, okay?

567
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,723
You got it.

568
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,605
What are you making?

569
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,889
It's a palace?
No, it's a castle.

570
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,163
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, of course.

571
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,686
It's beautiful.

572
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,524
You're really good.

573
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,366
I don't know how to make
one of those... bridges.

574
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,568
Oh, like a drawbridge?

575
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,490
Well, just, um, ...

576
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,602
if you make the doorway here ...

577
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,127
and then like the bridge going
down and then some chains.

578
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,601
That's it.
Over the moat.

579
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,169
I can't do it.

580
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,481
You do it.

581
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,483
But it's your drawing.

582
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,251
Really? Okay.

583
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,210
Well maybe you can... draw
some animals in the moat ...

584
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,487
... some dangerous animals so
people can't swim across.

585
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,408
Crocodiles and some
polar bears

586
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,482
and stuff that will eat you.

587
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,528
Okay.

588
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:00,328
I haven't used a crayon in a
really, really long time.

589
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,085
When I was a kid, I read
this story about a family, ...

590
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,322
and their car broke down in the desert.

591
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,563
And do.. do you know how
they survived? How?

592
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,291
They ate crayons and paste.

593
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,846
Eeew!
I know, it sounded pretty good to me.

594
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,891
I used to sneak paste to eat
when I was a kid. 
You did?

595
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,486
<i>I don't remember...</i>

596
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,642
<i>Want a couple a...</i>

597
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,404
The stuff we had was really good.

598
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,524
Delicious. You should try it.

599
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,126
- No.
- No.
- Hey...

600
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,568
You want to come in the
booth with me while I sing?

601
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,007
Okay.
Come on.

602
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,846
Hey. You didn't
say goodbye.

603
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,088
Yes, I did.
No, you didn't.

604
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,963
I'm going to miss you.
I'm going to miss you so much.

605
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,520
Okay.
All right.

606
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,446
I'll see you in ten days, okay?
Bye, baby.

607
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,204

608
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,167

609
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,131
You cannot tell him, so that
you really can't show him.

610
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,329
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

611
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,004
Who's that?

612
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,048
Hey. What are you
still doing here?

613
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,245
Um, Ok... Le.. let's go.
Let's go and check.

614
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,121
No, no, he didn't forget.
He knows it's his pick up day.

615
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,362
Honeymoon my ass.
He's messing with me.

616
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,841
Look, it's a violation
of the court order, ...

617
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,844
and he agreed to those
dates before he left.

618
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,322
You got to be kidding me.

619
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,006
Great! Great..

620
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,761
So, he says it's a violation
of the court order...

621
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,127
for them to not let us pick her up.

622
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,683
But, if they don't pick her up,
it's not a violation. Okay?

623
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,609
He knows it's
his pick up day.

624
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,206
Maybe ...
What, what, what?

625
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,806
We could go back to the court again.
No! No!

626
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,201
I'm not subjecting myself to that bullshit.

627
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,930
Where are my cigarettes?

628
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,809
Jesus!

629
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,291
A witch hunt, that's what it is.

630
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,806
Hey, are you hungry?

631
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,605
Do you get to make all
the food for everyone?

632
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,569
Uh, no.

633
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,325
I'm just.. I'm just a bartender.

634
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,522
Do you get lots of money?

635
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,807
Well, I get tips.

636
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,963
But not lots of money.
I wouldn't say that, no.

637
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,044
Do you think it's important
to make lots of money?

638
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,043
Uh-huh.
How come?

639
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,121
So you can be rich. Oh, of
course, so you can be rich.

640
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,885
What if you like doing something
where you don't make lots of money?

641
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,526
Like what?
Like being a teacher.

642
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,648
Or maybe you want
to be a nurse.

643
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,963
Or a fireman.
Or a bartender.

644
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,247
Yeah, or a bartender.

645
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,165
For now.

646
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,890
Here we go.

647
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,684
Bon appetit.

648
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,688
I... I thought you said
you liked eggs.

649
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,527
I don't want to ruin it.

650
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,441
Okay, see you later.

651
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,682
You're supposed to walk me in.

652
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,728
Are you sure we don't say bye here?

653
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,690
Really?

654
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,127
Okay.

655
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,124
Maisie has something she'd
like to share with the class.

656
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,328
This is my new stepfather.

657
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,129
Hi.

658
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,969
My father married my nanny,

659
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,771
so court made my mommy
 get married, too.

660
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,320

661
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,165
Tyler.
I have two stepfathers.

662
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,481
But, one is almost dead.

663
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,846

664
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,490
<i>"And most castles had 50
rooms and were in England."</i>

665
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,848
<i>"If someone hurt your
animal or tried to be rich,...</i>

666
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,845
<i>they would be killed
and put in jail."</i>

667
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,491
<i>"A lot of people in jail
hurt their-selves ...</i>

668
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,042
<i>so that they could go to
the hospital and have food."</i>

669
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:06,842
<i>"They ate stale bread, and then
gave the bread to the homeless."</i>

670
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,845
<i>"The end. Life in a Castle
by Maisie Elizabeth Beale."</i>

671
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,082
Wooow!

672
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,447
That's amazing.

673
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,724
What am I, invisible?

674
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,804
You know, you don't get a bonus for
making her fall in love with you.

675
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,481
Hey, baby, why don't you go to
your room for a little while ...

676
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,801
so Lincoln and I can talk, okay?

677
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,563
Dude, how am I supposed to go away
off to work and leave her with you...

678
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,847
when you pull this shit?

679
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,843
What are you talking about?
And when did this tour come about?

680
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,365
You deliberately undermine me.

681
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,006

682
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,330
Why does everything have
to be such a nightmare ?

683
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,840
You know, I've turned
into this like petty ...

684
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,844
And I don't recognize
myself anymore.

685
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,084
You know, baby, all I wanted was for
him to make things easier for us.

686
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,202
Your story is very cool.

687
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,364
Thank you.

688
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,205
Hey.

689
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,009
What are you
thinking about?

690
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,367
Nothing.

691
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,044
No?

692
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,129
You want to come to
work with me tomorrow?

693
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,283
Maybe you could help me pick
out my costumes for the tour.

694
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,408
Would you like that?

695
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,562

696
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,490

697
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,446
Your Dad's an asshole.
He really is.

698
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:23,048
First he disappears, and then
he shows up out of nowhere.

699
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,566
I don't know
how to deal with this.

700
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,762
I really don't.

701
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,128
Baby, I got to lie down.

702
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,129
Lincoln, Beale's downstairs.

703
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,323
Hey.

704
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,765
Come here.

705
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,923
Whoa. You missed me? 
Uh-huh.

706
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,520
Yeah, we were wondering when we
were going to see you again.

707
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,807
You're the husband?
Yeah.

708
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,121
It's... It's the new husband.

709
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,481
My name is Lincoln. 
It's Beale.
Pleased to meet you.

710
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,484
Nice to meet you.

711
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,927
I'd give you a couple of pointers
but I doubt that the, uh, ...

712
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,049
Jacoby and tragedy
that was our relationship ...

713
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,169
would apply to the farce that
you two guys are playing out.

714
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,850
Okay.. 
Okay.
Okay..

715
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,809
Anyway, good luck.
Yeah.

716
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,365
Bye, Maisie.
Whooh!

717
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,205
Bye.

718
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,850
Thank you.

719
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,681
Tall and young. Huh.

720
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,162
It's funny. He's so not her type.

721
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,727
Hilarious.

722
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,363
How's your mum?

723
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,771
Fine.

724
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,171
Happy?

725
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,480
Uh-huh.

726
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,243
A word that sounds like owl?

727
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,970
Tyler.
Clown.

728
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,168
Clown. 
Excellent.
Victor.

729
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,368
Town.
Town.

730
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,090
Maisie.
Sound.

731
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,241
Sound. 
Good.

732
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,090
Which is your favorite?

733
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,084
I like the blue one.

734
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,606
It's getting late, Mais.
We should go.

735
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,647
Are we still going
on a boat with Daddy?

736
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,609
What boat, sweetie?

737
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,445
In Italy, like he said.

738
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,966
Um, I don't know. Maybe.

739
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,168
Are you and Daddy still married?

740
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,844
Of course.

741
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,207
It's not like pretend?

742
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,248
No. Why would you ask that?

743
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,005
I don't know.

744
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,285
Oh, Maisie.

745
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,004
Come on, Beale, ...

746
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,849
you didn't even tell us
you were leaving.

747
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,729
First, we were going
to be coming with you, ...

748
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,531
and then it was only going
to be for a few days ...

749
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,887
When are you coming back?

750
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,122
What do you mean
you don't know?

751
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,611
Hold on.

752
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,249
What are you doing up?

753
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,527
Does your throat still hurt?

754
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,731
It's not time for
your medicine, yet.

755
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,280
I'm talking to your
father in London.

756
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,887
Can I talk to him?

757
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,689
Here's Maisie.

758
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,245
Daddy?

759
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:22,130
I don't feel good.

760
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,044
No.

761
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,288
I miss you, too.

762
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,330
It's me.

763
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,088
I don't know. I told you.

764
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,242
They were supposed to pick
her up three days ago.

765
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,847
It would just be nice to know when 
anything is going to happen ...

766
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,729
about anything.

767
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,882
Okay?

768
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,485
No.

769
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,608
I should just go.

770
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,126
Right.
Bye.

771
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,964

772
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,088
I'll be right back.

773
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,921
You're three days late... It's 10 oclock
at night, and she's not well.

774
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,321
It's okay.
We'll take a taxi.

775
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,971
It's not okay. She's got
a temperature of 101!

776
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,644
It's ...

777
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,529
Heeey!

778
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,650
Oh. You're not feeling well, are you?

779
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,643
I have the bug.

780
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,484
Oh, the bug.

781
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,130
That sounds bad.

782
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,010
Why didn't you come?
I'm sorry.

783
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,731
There was this whole
mix-up and ...

784
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,770
Well, kinda like three 
mix-ups actually.

785
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,764
I have to take my
medicine in an hour.

786
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,002
Okay.
Okay.

787
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,925
So, what do you want me to do?

788
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,525
Susanna is going to kill me.

789
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,086
Come back in a day or two.
A day or ... what ...

790
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,288
I can't come back tonight without her.

791
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,169
Susanna is going on tour this weekend.

792
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:51,245
Lincoln, she's a child. 
She's not well.

793
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,809
Okay. I'll see you in a couple of days.

794
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,484
Okay?

795
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,210
You get some rest,
so you feel better, okay?

796
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,921
Goodnight.

797
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,730
That one!

798
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,245
Good choice.

799
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,043
Heeey!
Mommy.
Mmumf.

800
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,045
No, we need some of ...

801
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,889
Baby, let me show you this bus.

802
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,485
It's good, huh?

803
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,881
We have ice-cream.
We have chocolate.

804
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:12,325
You want one of these?
No! No! It's out of the question!

805
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,011
Hang on tight. I got it?
You got it?

806
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,605
Cool.

807
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,364
I.. I can't talk right now, Phil.

808
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,249
Good, here we go.

809
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,329
Here we go, baby.
Wooh, we almost rolled over.

810
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,769
I can't see anything.

811
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,525
How's this?
One, two, three, cheese.

812
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,881
Hey, baby, look,
there's Lincoln.

813
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,209
Come on, let's go.

814
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,761
It sucks that we don't
have more time together.

815
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,241
But you know I love you
more than anything, right?

816
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,810
Right?

817
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:02,967
I do.

818
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,081
Okay, go!

819
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,840
Watch out!

820
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,081
Okay.

821
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,690
Okay, bye.

822
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,643
...hotel room.

823
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,087
She's in the bathroom
for like 15 minutes.

824
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,003
I'm watching television...

825
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:28,323
and she comes out
of the bathroom buck naked.

826
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,084
I'm like, okay, fine...

827
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,491
I push her up
against the glass...

828
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,846
Your order, sir.

829
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,931
Do you want to come sit over
here instead, by the cherries?

830
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,769
It's more fun over there.

831
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,085
Is it okay if she sits here?

832
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,640
It's fine.

833
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,489
Check this out.

834
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,005
Hello.

835
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,685
Oooh!

836
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,287
I can't hear you!

836b
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,287
Let's go.

837
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,970
It's like you're spider monkey.

838
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,481
Ooh.

839
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,400
You got an eye on that?

840
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,845
Don't.
Is that it?

841
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,048
I figured you could play.

842
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,968
What about Tonya?
Again?

843
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,361
Yeah, I'll try.
I'll call you back.

844
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,762
Hey, Maisie?
Come.. Come here a minute.

845
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,047
They called from.. from work,

846
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,929
and someone is sick today,

847
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,765
so I'm going to have to
go in and work, probably.

848
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,684
I could go with you again.

849
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,091
No!

850
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,128
No, we ...
We can't do that.

851
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,441
It's not a good idea.

852
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,045
Don't bite your nails.

853
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,083
You ate glue.
Yeah.

854
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,282
All right, wise guy,
come on, let's go.

855
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,203
I'm not a guy. I'm a girl.

856
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,282
Yeah, come on, wise girl.

857
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,604
What if she's not here?

858
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,524
I don't know.

859
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,602

860
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,569
Maybe Caroline can come.

861
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,369
No, Caroline's got a boyfriend.

862
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,331
Come on.

863
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:02,206
Can I go to work with you then?
No, you can't.

864
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,047
Aah, we'll .. we'll figure
something out.

865
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,683
I know it's late over there, Beale.

866
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,808
I've been stuck in this
hallway for an hour.

867
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,451
Just tell the guy at the door
to come up here and let me in.

868
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,084
Aah, hey.

869
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,884
What are you doing here?

870
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,486
Well, I.. l know it hasn't
been ten days, yet.

871
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:28,202
But I.. 
He has to go to work.

872
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,968
Yeah. Yeah, it's, uh, you know,
things have been a little rough

873
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,451
with her mother gone and all.

874
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,409
Right.

875
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,847
You know, I was just thinking
like we're both in...

876
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,968
You thought what?

877
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,405
That I'd feel sorry for you?

878
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,801
That I've got nothing else to do?

879
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,043
That I'm just that sort of person?

880
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,441
Well, I'm not, so you deal with it.

881
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,851
It's your problem, not mine.

882
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,922
I didn't... I didn't say that.

883
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,729
I am locked out
of my own apartment...

884
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:03,361
because my husband didn't
bother putting me on the lease.

885
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,681
Like I don't exist.

886
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,451
I have done everything
I was supposed to.

887
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:19,763
He can't use people like this.

888
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,684
I.. I didn't realize ...

889
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,286
I'm really sorry.

890
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,048
Just go.

891
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,168
Please.
Yeah.

892
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,969
Come on, Maisie.

893
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,526
I'm sorry.

894
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,805
You know I didn't
mean you, don't you?

895
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,206
Thank you.

896
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,368
None of this is your fault.

897
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,410
I'll see you later, Maisie.

898
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,767
It's not Lincoln's fault, either.

899
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,366
He's just mixed up, too.

900
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,723
You really like him, don't you?

901
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,609
I love him.

902
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,490
I'm sorry I got mad at him.

903
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,927
He must think I'm awful.

904
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,686
Mommy gets mad
at him all the time.

905
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,010
There he is.

906
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,565
Hey, Maisie.

907
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,523
Hey.
Hi.

908
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,489
I did the icing but it's from her...

909
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,767
'cause she's sorry
she got mad at you.

910
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,361
Ooh! Cake!

911
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,647
I told her that you like chocolate.

912
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,802
I do like chocolate.

913
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,491
Thank you.
Thank you both.

914
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,445
Uh, you guys hungry?

915
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,568
Yeah? I know someone
who works here ...

916
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,364
so I might be able
to get you a table.

917
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,363
You work here.

918
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,681
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I do work here.

919
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,240
Uh, come on.

920
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,084
You know what some
people eat here?

921
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:43,000
What? Raw hamburger
with raw eggs on it.

922
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:44,809
Eeooow!

923
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,484
These are from Lincoln.

924
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,083
Would you eat a raw hamburger
with a raw egg on it?

925
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:57,528
Never!
Would you?

926
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:01,484
Glasgow has got such a vibe
about it and a lot of culture.

927
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,411
It's so funny... like, to me..

928
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,926
you don't have a very
thick Scottish accent..

929
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,367
but when you say Glasgow, Glasgow.
That's nice.

930
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,680

931
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,081
Yeah, it is, it is.

932
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,640

933
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:18,803
Yeah, I always wonder if I'll be..

934
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,204
[muffled conversation]

935
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,122
Thank you for the cake and tonight.

936
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,531
Yeah.

937
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,489
Okay.

938
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,891
Goodnight.

939
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,249
Morning.
Morning.

940
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,289
How'd you sleep?
Nice.

941
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:13,603
What do you want for breakfast?

942
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,648
Hmmm, I don't know.

943
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,609
Pancakes.

944
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,365
Okay. Pancakes it is.

945
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,527

946
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,042

947
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,487

948
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,645
Lincoln.

949
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,451

950
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,804
Sorry I'm late.

951
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,247
The wolf is scaring her grandma.

952
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,527
Oh, bummer.

953
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,887
She's chasing the wolf there.

954
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,247

955
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,601
Okay, higher.
Higher.

956
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,521
Don't get too close! 
There are so many.

957
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,364
This is really cool.

958
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,841
I can't believe I haven't 
been here before.

959
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,002
Look, see, there's
a baby turtle.

960
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,844
Woow!

961
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,524
Look at that guy.
He's checking you out.

962
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,086
So many of them.

963
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,844
This is great.

964
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,968
Yeah, I like it here.

965
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,929
You know what?
What.

966
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,288
You could buy turtles on the street.

967
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,886
They keep them in buckets,
and they're only $1.

968
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,083
Really? Wow. I was
bitten by a turtle once.

969
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,806
Were you really?
Yeah, yeah.

970
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,167
It even left a scar if you...

971
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,004
Big?

972
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,802
It could've left a scar.

973
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,486
It's that bad. It could've left a scar.
Right, yeah.

974
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:56,086
So, is it quite traumatic for you..
It was!
being here with the turtles?

975
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,601
This is kinda like therapy for me.
Oh, it is? Okay.

976
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,330
Meeting the beast again.

977
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:05,167
That's the last one
until after dinner, okay?

978
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,811
Daddy!

979
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,048
We'll do this. 
Daddy!

980
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,361
Hey, my favorite girl.

981
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,283
Oooh! Heh, you got heavy.

982
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,291
What a surprise. Yeah, I
had a change of schedule.

983
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:19,850

984
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,810
I can smell candy.

985
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,321
We went to go see a puppet show.
Did you now?

986
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,562
Red Riding Hood.
Oh, that's scary.

987
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,244
I was just about
to make some dinner.

988
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,971
Ah, not for me, thanks.
Yeh, I ate on the plane.

989
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,883
Yuck!

990
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,291
Aah, I got a couple of calls to make,

991
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,249
but I'll join you guys later.

992
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,129
Come on, Maisie, we
should get washed up.

993
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:49,161
[muffled quarreling]

994
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,210
Oh, hey, sweetie.

995
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,004
Where is Margo?

996
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,445
[exhales]

997
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,648
Phew.

998
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:39,406
Maybe she went for a long walk.

999
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,404
Let's go get breakfast.

1000
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,003
I, um ...

1001
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,242
I don't need to tell you
things are a bit of a mess ...

1002
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,687
since your mom
ran off.

1003
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,127
She's on a big tour.

1004
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,441
Not so big from what I hear.

1005
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:14,605
But, uh, be that as it may, ...

1006
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,445
Um, I may have to go back to England.

1007
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,967
Um, couple of, you know,
business opportunities,

1008
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,328
and um.. your grandmother's
not getting any younger.

1009
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,607
You... you understand?

1010
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:30,287
Can I come? We can... we
can get the coins.

1011
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,601
Coins? What coins?

1012
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:36,002
Like your Daddy found in the
ground when you were little.

1013
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,568
You remember me telling you that?

1014
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,325
Maybe we can find some more.

1015
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,210
Would you like that?
Yeah? Just the two of us?

1016
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,567
You and your old man
digging for coins?

1017
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,325
I could do with a few.

1018
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,282
Why not? Your mother
would have a fit.

1019
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,846
But I don't think I'd have a
problem squaring it with the judge

1020
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,922
after she ditched you with that bartender.

1021
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,129
I'm sure I could settle with Margo
without any legal nonsense.

1022
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:06,970
Why not?

1023
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,083
Why not?
Why not?

1024
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,162
Will I get back in time?

1025
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:15,568
For what?
To go to Mommy's.

1026
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,687
This wouldn't be a day
excursion. You know that?

1027
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,406
This would be like a permanent thing.

1028
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:25,450
All the time?
All the time.

1029
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,091
Maybe Mommy would like
to live there, too.

1030
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,889
No, there's no Mommy in England.

1031
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,406
You can't.. It's... Mmuuh...

1032
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,887
There's a whole ocean.

1033
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,964
It's...

1034
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,846
You know, England is, um...

1035
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,083
England is pretty cold, actually.

1036
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,128
And it rains a lot.

1037
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,202
And, um, ...

1038
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,806
and we need to have
a rethink, you know.

1039
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,967
And you're on the fence.
I can see that.

1040
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,566
I think you'd be happier here.

1041
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,728
And outside.

1042
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,241
Um, the good news ...

1043
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:28,688
is that when I visit
America for work, ...

1044
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,728
I can see you, too.

1045
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,730
Does your nose still make that
squeaky noise when you press it?

1046
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,764
[squeaks]

1047
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,320
Okay. You would have laughed at
that when you were four years old.

1048
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,402
Don't deny it.

1049
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,288
Take care, Mr. Beale.
Sure.

1050
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:10,960
Bye.

1051
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,407
Okay, bye.

1052
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,448
Have a safe trip now.

1053
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:27,330
Quinn, 8B.

1054
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,721
Volgol, 11E.

1055
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:32,963
Remmy, 9C.

1056
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,566
Laporte, penthouse.

1057
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:39,804
Remmy, 9C.

1058
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:43,043
Resident in 1A. Laporte, penthouse.

1059
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,487
I thought your father was away.

1060
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:49,724
Well, he was here when we
came from the puppets.

1061
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,007
Well, I can't really watch you now.

1062
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,884
I got to be in Chinatown
in half an hour,

1063
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,724
and I'm sort of late already.

1064
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,768
Is it still Margo's week?

1065
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,525
She and Daddy had a fight, and
this morning she was gone.

1066
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,090
Gone?

1067
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,208
Where did she go?
I don't know.

1068
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,930
But Daddy's
going to England,

1069
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,411
and he said that
I could go with him

1070
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,528
and then he said
that I couldn't.

1071
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,888
And then we came in a
taxi and he left me here.

1072
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,601
Wow! That's a lot.

1073
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,967
Okay, I'll ...
Why don't ...

1074
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,044
I'll... I'll call Margo.
See if I can find her.

1075
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,850
It'll be okay.

1076
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,804
Oh, there she is.

1077
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:47,045
Hey!
How are ya?

1078
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,963
Hi.

1079
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,450
Thanks for coming.

1080
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,727
Yeah, of course.

1081
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,130
What if they don't have a turtle?

1082
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,487
I'm sure we'll find one somewhere.

1083
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:12,370
Okay, well, actually
I have to go this way.

1084
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:15,091
But I'll see your turtle
when I get home, okay?

1085
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:18,323
Thanks for your help.
Okay, well, just call me.

1086
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,129
Mommy!

1087
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,202
Oh, my God, baby.

1088
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:24,282
I'm so happy to see you.

1089
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,488
We're going to get a turtle.

1090
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,847
A turtle?
Turtle?

1091
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,127
So, what are you two
doing with my daughter?

1092
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,050
What are you talking about? 
Looking after her while you're on tour.

1093
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:36,521
What are you, like a stalker?

1094
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,881
What are you going
to steal from me next, huh?

1095
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,406
So, what are you two
doing together, huh?

1096
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,329
What am I doing?
What are you doing?

1097
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,890
What are you doing in New York?

1098
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,162
I'm back for half a day.
Oh, yeah? When were you going to tell me?

1099
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:49,447
Cars are coming.
Hey, hey, hey!

1100
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,727
Do you mind? I have a kid here!

1101
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,768
What the fuck?
What are you doing?

1102
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,803
Really, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

1103
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:57,564
I'm taking my daughter, that's what.

1104
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,449
Get out of my face.

1105
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,366
I'll love to get out of your face.

1106
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,602
You don't deserve her.

1107
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,367
I'm done.

1108
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,926
Let's go get the turtle.
Let's go get it.

1109
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,602
Let's go get the turtle.

1110
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,485
Do you like it?

1111
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,090
It's what you wanted, right?
Uh-huh.

1112
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,571
Yeah.

1113
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,483
What do you want to do?

1114
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,324
Hungry or anything?

1115
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,841
You want something to eat?
No, thanks.

1116
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:55,329
You know, I didn't even know
we were stopping in New York.

1117
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:58,244
Okay?
Okay!

1118
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,290
Yeah?

1119
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,488
Okay.

1120
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,047
This turtle is pretty cool, you know.

1121
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,808
Want to come to our house?

1122
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,641
Want to come to our house, turtle?

1123
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,201
No, I don't.. I don't
care what you tell him.

1124
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,760
Just say that I have
laryngitis or something...

1125
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:32,323
or mercury poisoning,
all right?

1126
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,482
Just get me out of it.

1127
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,483
No, I'm not leaving her.

1128
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,729
Goddammit, come on.

1129
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,450
What am I supposed to do?

1130
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,330
I can't go back
on the road right now.

1131
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,370
I can't! No, I'm not going to!

1132
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:51,405
Jesus, what do you
expect me to do?

1133
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,324
Hey, baby.

1134
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,200
Honey, wake up. Okay, wake up.
We got to go.

1135
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,123
It really sucks but we got to go.
Come on.

1136
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,810
Okay, baby...

1137
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,730
I am so sorry but I ...
I got to go.

1138
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,484
I just can't miss another show right now...

1139
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:17,562
because I'll have a massive loss on my hand...

1140
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:20,564
and I just can't handle that right now.

1141
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:24,002
Okay? But you know what I'm going to do?

1142
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,162
I mean... I'm going to have you flown out
for a couple of shows...

1143
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:28,129
and then we can hang out for a while...

1144
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,329
and then maybe we could
sing a duet together.

1145
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:35,570
Is that too corny?

1146
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:39,440
Okay, um, you can hang out here with
Lincoln until he's finished work...

1147
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,091
and then he's going to take you home. 
Okay.

1148
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,806
I love you so much.

1149
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,120
I got to go, baby.

1150
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,687
Maisie.

1151
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,206
I'm going to wait
till you go inside, okay?

1152
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,123
It's all right.

1153
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:26,527
Hey, hon.
Remember me?

1154
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,763
Where's Lincoln?
He's not on tonight.

1155
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,729
Who are you with?

1156
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,280
My mom put me here so that
I could stay with him.

1157
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,449
Well, let me talk to your mom.
She left.

1158
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,330
Hi, still serving ?
Absolutely.

1159
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,802
Um... Stay right here, okay?

1160
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,769
I'll be right back.

1161
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,410
Right this way.

1162
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:23,046
I'll keep making calls and
see if I can find him.

1163
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,805
Thanks for doing this. No problem.
See you tomorrow.

1164
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,048

1165
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,728

1166
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,531
What are you doing up?

1167
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,125
Hey, kid.

1168
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,807
Where's Margo?
I want to go home.

1169
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:51,209
Where's Margo? You're going to
stay here tonight, remember?

1170
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,442
It's going to be fine.
Let's go back to bed.

1171
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:57,161
I want to go home. 
Come here.
I want to go home.

1172
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,931
Please, I want to go home.

1173
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,490
It's okay.

1174
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,961
It's gonna be fine.

1175
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,969
Just a couple of things,
okay, sweetie? Okay.

1176
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,168
What about my turtle?

1177
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,722
We'll get the turtle.

1178
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,369
And you know what?

1179
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:33,087
What? My cousin told
me where the key is.

1180
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,328
Guess where it is? Where?

1181
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:38,847
It's under the mat on the back door.

1182
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:40,649
You're going to be okay
with your bag?

1183
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,085
Uh-huh.

1184
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,690
[whispering]
Oh, God.

1185
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:03,411
God, don't do this.

1186
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,204
There's an upstairs.

1187
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,009
Yeah, you want
to go see?

1188
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:59,571

1189
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,365
It's cold.

1190
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,805
Feels good.

1191
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,205

1192
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,570
Look!

1193
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,324
What if someone buys the house?
Where would we go?

1194
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,442
It doesn't happen that fast.

1195
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,124
What if we had to go somewhere else?

1196
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,884
How would people know where we are?

1197
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,082
We tell them. What if we couldn't find them?

1198
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,811
We'd find them and we'd tell hem.

1199
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:43,327
Anyway, I told them where we were
so they wouldn't be worried.

1200
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,846
Dinner's ready.

1201
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:52,441
What do you think this should be?

1202
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,921
Probably a window.
A window?

1203
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:02,324
Hey, Maisie.
Come on.

1204
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,209
Okay, let's go to the beach.

1205
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,446
Can you hear the ocean? Shh.

1206
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,329
Yes.
You can?

1207
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:13,885
Wow.

1208
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,968
Okay. Two pails.

1209
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:19,405
Two pails?

1210
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,050
Let's trade.

1211
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,241
There you go.

1212
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:32,169
Lincoln!

1213
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:36,170
Lincoln!

1214
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:37,287
Hey.

1215
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,525
Hey.

1216
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,164
How are you?

1217
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,004
Want to see my room?

1218
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,651
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to see your room.

1219
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,848
Of course.
Of course.

1220
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,610
I'd love to see your room. 
Hey!

1221
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,243
Hey.

1222
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,930
I'm sorry.

1223
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,606
It's not working again.

1224
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,447
It's not working again!

1225
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,363
I got it.

1226
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,807
There's a place in the back
where we can get worms.

1227
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:27,724
And we can go on the boat
next door whenever we want.

1228
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,962
Oh, wow. Perfect.

1229
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:33,527
We can go tomorrow if you want to.
Lincoln just got here.

1230
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,962
How long are you staying? 
Well, definitely long enough to go on the boat.

1231
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,646
It's beautiful here!

1232
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,483
Uh, I brought you something from
the city I thought you might like.

1233
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,449
Wait. Wait, I'll show you something.

1234
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:55,161
There's a picture that I
thought might be interesting.

1235
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:58,290
Look at that. Look.

1236
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:59,930
You know why?
Why?

1237
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,048
You know where I was thinking we might
want this guy?

1238
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,088
We can put him in our moat.

1239
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,322
In our moat, that was what
I was thinking. Perfect.

1240
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,283
You guys have a moat? 
Of course.

1241
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,362
Okay.

1242
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:16,290

1243
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:19,964

1244
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,000
What's that?
Look at that.

1245
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,929
Do you want to pick it up?
Look at that, Maisie.

1246
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:29,328
Gently, gently. 
It's holding onto the rock.

1247
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,402
Look, he's moving.

1248
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,687
He's moving.

1249
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:38,047
He's waving at you.

1250
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,606
Alright, you're going to hold my hand?
Yeah.

1251
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,603
Okay. Don't stand on him.

1252
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:44,523
Can we go on the boat tomorrow?

1253
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,762
Why don't you ask the
fishermen when they get back?

1254
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:49,923
I won't! I won't!

1255
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:01,960
He said we could go tomorrow!

1256
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:06,928
One, two three, four, five, six, seven.

1257
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,446
I want to buy it.

1258
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,648
You already have it.

1259
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:13,609
I want to buy a hotel.
Can I have two?

1260
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,364
Yeah.

1261
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,363
Fifty?

1262
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:20,569
Are you kidding me?
You can't even buy a hostel.

1263
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:22,722
You got to do better than that.
Give me a little more.

1264
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:25,047
Two hotels you got to pay.
Give me, uh ...

1265
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:29,444
Oh, how generous of you. You don't
even get a sleeping bag for that.

1266
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:33,206
We weren't allowed to play
Monopoly when I was a kid.

1267
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:36,688
What did you play instead? This
Swiss doctor made some games.

1268
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:39,206
They're supposed to instill
cooperation and pacifism.

1269
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:42,767
That's probably why you're losing.
Yeah. Ha, ha, ha.

1270
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,604

1271
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:46,444
In my house, it was every man for himself.

1272
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,284
Oh, thanks for the warning.

1273
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:49,646

1274
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:51,768
What's funny?
You are!

1275
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:54,281
Yeah, you are. You are so funny.
You are so funny.

1276
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:56,522
Alright, thank you. Okay.

1277
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,762
No.
Go to jail.

1278
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,689
Oh, come on.
I need some luck now.

1279
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,001

1280
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,162
It's not fair.

1281
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:14,491
[bus approaching]

1282
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:44,847
Surprise.

1283
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:47,808
Ah, Oh.

1284
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:51,965
Oh, my little beach bunny.

1285
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:55,965
Hey, guess what? I'm playing
Virginia Beach tomorrow night.

1286
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:58,281
I found this really nice girl with a dog...

1287
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:00,328
who can watch you during the show.

1288
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,802
And then after that we go to
North Carolina and Tennessee.

1289
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:07,129
What kind of a dog? 
I don't know.

1290
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,407
But, um, it's kind of a long drive,...

1291
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:12,086
so if you want to say goodbye to
these guys, you'd better hurry up.

1292
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,851
Okay, go ahead. Go on.

1293
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:20,043
Or you can just come back to
the bus and we can take off ...

1294
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:22,361
and you can open all the
presents I got you.

1295
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,084
You want to do that?

1296
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:29,926
I want to meet the dog
but maybe the day after.

1297
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,970
Well, baby, the day after I'm
playing Raleigh, so I got to go.

1298
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:36,601
Okay, come on. Come on, let's go, babe.
Come on, come on.

1299
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:39,924
What's up? What's the matter?
Come on.

1300
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,162
We're supposed to go on a boat tomorrow.

1301
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:44,720
Baby, we can go on a boat any day, okay?
It's not a big deal.

1302
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,609
We got to go.
Come on, let's go.

1303
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:49,047
Come on.
Come on.

1304
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,805
Maisie, come on.

1305
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:54,201
Don't you want to come?

1306
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,921
[owl hooting]

1307
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,002
Fine.

1308
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,970
Why did I fucking bother?

1309
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,771
God, what is it? You just decided
you don't like me anymore ?

1310
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,524
Is that it?

1311
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,683
What, are you scared of me?

1312
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:34,764
Oh, shit.

1313
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:43,130
I'm sorry, baby. I'm so sorry.

1314
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:46,603
I don't want you to be scared.

1315
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:49,725
I'm an idiot, you know.

1316
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,491
I'm, um ...

1317
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:55,803
Hey, Maisie, Maisie,
baby, you know what?

1318
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:58,486
I really love you.

1319
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:01,086
I really do.

1320
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:04,562
Before you where born, I... I didn't
know it was possible to love somebody...

1321
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:06,210
as much as I love you.

1322
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:09,284
You're just like my, my little baby.

1323
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:12,369
Can I tell you something?

1324
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:17,964
A long time ago I was just like you.

1325
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,329
I was just like you.

1326
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:28,647
You want to go on a boat tomorrow?

1327
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:38,130
You want to... stay with them for a while?

1328
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:52,527
You know who your mother is, right?

1329
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:55,365
You.

1330
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:21,644
Let's go open your presents.

1331
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:24,685
Come on.

1332
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,207
Alright, you gotta tell
me how big you want it.

1333
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:18,765
That's good!

1334
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:20,490
That's good?
That's good.
That's good.

1335
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,085
Do you know where the filters are?

1336
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:24,521
Um, it was on the table.

1337
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,489
Look at that little baby pancake.

1338
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,324
That's tiny. I want a big pancake.

1339
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:29,640
Shall we do another one? 

1340
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,762
You ready?
I want a big one.

1341
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:35,009
You want a big one? This one's very big.
Okay, good!

1342
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:34,048
Come on, hurry up.

1343
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:05,880
