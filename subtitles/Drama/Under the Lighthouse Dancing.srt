1
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,885
Hi, everybody.
This is your cousin Brucie. Whoa!

2
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,989
Our summer romances are in full bloom,
and everybody's in love!

3
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:05,158
So cousins, here's a great song
from the Four Seasons.

4
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,269
That was the summer of 1963...

5
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,906
when everybody called me ""Baby""
and it didn't occur to me to mind.

6
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,950
That was before
President Kennedy was shot...

7
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,985
before the Beatles came...

8
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,154
when I couldn't wait
to join the Peace Corps...

9
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:38,125
and I thought I'd never
find a guy as great as my dad.

10
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,170
That was the summer
we went to Kellerman's.

11
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,392
Ping-Pong in the west arcade,
softball in the east diamond.

12
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,728
All you Sandy Koufaxes,
get out there!

13
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:17,264
Complimentary dance lessons
in the gazebo.

14
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:19,967
Oh, my God.
Look at that!

15
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:24,171
Mom, I should've brought the coral
shoes. You said I was taking too much.

16
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,874
Well, sweetheart,
you brought ten pairs.

17
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:29,443
But the coral shoes
matched that dress.

18
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,178
This is not a tragedy.

19
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:35,716
A tragedy is three men trapped in a mine
or police dogs used in Birmingham.

20
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,985
Monks burning themselves
in protest.

21
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,453
Butt out, Baby.

22
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,257
Okay, we got horseshoes
on the south lawn in 15 minutes!

23
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:46,293
We've got splish-splash
the water class down by the lake.

24
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,997
We have the still life art class.
We got volleyball and croquet.

25
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,599
And for you older folks,
we got sacks!

26
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:55,369
Doc!

27
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:56,703
Doc!

28
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,639
Max!

29
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,477
Doc, after all these years
I finally got you up on my mountain.

30
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:05,812
How's the blood pressure?

31
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,814
I want you girls to know...

32
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:11,285
if it were not for this man,
I'd be standing here dead.

33
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,555
- Billy, get the bags.
- Right away, Doc.

34
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,824
I kept the best cabin
for you and your beautiful girls.

35
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,730
Hey, thanks a lot.

36
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,499
You want a job here?

37
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,735
There's a merengue class in
the gazebo in the next few minutes.

38
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,505
The greatest teacher.
Used to be a Rockette.

39
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:35,576
It's his first real vacation
in six years, Max. Take it easy.

40
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,512
Three weeks here,
it'll feel like a year.

41
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:42,149
One, two, three, four! Stomp
those grapes and stomp some more!

42
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:46,386
One, two, three, four!
Listen to the music!

43
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,855
Sorry.

44
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,690
Move your caboose
and shake it loose!

45
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,594
One, two, three, four!
Start the train!

46
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,868
Come on, men!
Follow me into a round robin!

47
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,171
Ladies, the inner circle!

48
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:15,816
Come on, ladies!

49
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:20,320
God wouldn't have given you maracas
if he didn't want you to shake them!

50
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,427
Okay now, ladies,
when I say ""stop""...

51
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,497
you're gonna find
the man of your dreams.

52
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:32,833
Stop!

53
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:38,639
Remember, he's the boss on
the dance floor, if nowhere else.

54
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,751
Mom, Dad, I'm going up
to the main house to look around.

55
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,091
There are two kinds of help here.

56
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,360
You waiters are
all college guys...

57
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:37,331
and I went to Harvard
and Yale to hire you.

58
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,367
And why did I do that? Why?

59
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,571
I shouldn't have to remind you.
This is a family place.

60
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:48,442
That means you keep your fingers out
of the water, hair out of the soup...

61
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,711
and show the goddamn
daughters a good time.

62
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:52,946
All the daughters.

63
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,617
Even the dogs.

64
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:59,453
Schlepp 'em out to the terrace,
show 'em the stars.

65
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,822
- Romance 'em any way you want.
- Got that, guys?

66
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,891
Hey, hold it!
Hold it.

67
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:09,429
Well, if it isn't
the entertainment staff.

68
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,798
Listen, wise ass,
you got your own rules.

69
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:14,067
Dance with the daughters.
Teach 'em the mambo...

70
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,770
the cha-cha,
anything they pay for.

71
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,438
That's it.

72
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,707
That's where it ends.

73
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:24,444
No funny business, no conversations,
and keep you hands off!

74
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:31,018
It's the same at all these places. Some
ass in the woods, but no conversation.

75
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,020
Watch it, Rodriguez.

76
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:39,159
Can you keep that straight, Johnny?
What you can't lay your hands on?

77
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:47,367
Just put your pickle on everybody's
plate, and leave the hard stuff to me.

78
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,610
Sit down and I'll
get you some wine.

79
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,012
Thank you, Max.

80
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,051
This is Dr. and Mrs. Houseman.

81
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:08,188
Baby, Lisa, this is your waiter,
Robbie Gould.

82
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:10,958
Yale medical school.

83
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:14,962
These people are my special guests.
Give them anything they want.

84
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,964
- Enjoy.
- Thanks, Max.

85
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:25,873
Look at all this leftover food. Are
there still starving children in Europe?

86
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:28,675
- Try Southeast Asia, Ma.
- Right.

87
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,345
Robbie, Baby wants to send
her leftover pot roast...

88
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:34,548
to Southeast Asia,
so anything you don't finish, wrap up.

89
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:38,085
Max, our Baby's gonna
change the world.

90
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:41,522
- And what are you gonna do, Missy?
- Lisa's gonna decorate it.

91
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,690
She already does.

92
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:49,630
Doc, I want you to meet someone.
My grandson Neil.

93
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,099
Goes to the Cornell School
of Hotel Management.

94
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,434
Baby's starting
Mount Holyoke in the fall.

95
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,171
Oh, great.

96
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,414
Are you going to major in English?

97
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:10,951
No. Economics of
underdeveloped countries.

98
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:14,421
- I'm going into the Peace Corps.
- After the final show...

99
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:18,292
I'm going to Mississippi with
a couple of busboys, freedom ride.

100
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,280
This is our own Tito Suarez.

101
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:29,963
Mambo!
Yeah! Come on!

102
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,339
Who's that?

103
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:41,842
Oh, them.
They're the dance people.

104
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:44,912
They're here to keep
the guests happy.

105
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:11,705
They shouldn't show off with each other.
That's not gonna sell lessons.

106
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:31,185
- Hi, kids. Having fun?
- Yeah.

107
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:35,122
Actually, I've gotta excuse myself.
I'm in charge of the games tonight.

108
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:37,925
Would you like to help me
get things started?

109
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,660
Sure she would.

110
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,104
This'll only hurt for a minute.
You've got Blue Cross, right?

111
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,983
Was that good for you?

112
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:06,653
And for being such a good sport,
here you go!

113
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,128
I finally met a girl
exactly like my mother.

114
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:18,298
Dresses like her, acts like her.
So I brought her home.

115
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:20,300
My father doesn't like her!

116
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,871
Go figure.

117
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,489
- Hi.
- How'd you get here?

118
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,157
- I was taking a walk.
- Go back.

119
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,193
Let me help you.
What's up there?

120
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:21,195
No guests allowed.
House rules.

121
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:25,732
Why don't you go back to the playhouse?
I saw you dancing with little boss man.

122
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:32,539
Can you keep a secret?

123
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:37,377
Your parents would kill you.

124
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,379
Max would kill me.

125
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,801
Where'd they learn to do that?

126
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:36,737
Where?

127
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,806
I don't know. Kids are doing it
in their basements back home.

128
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:43,076
Wanna try it?

129
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:45,846
Come on, Baby.

130
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,953
Can you imagine dancing like this
on the main floor...

131
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,455
home of the family fox-trot?

132
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,024
Max would close
the place down first.

133
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,425
That's my cousin, Johnny Castle.

134
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,562
He got me the job here.

135
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:30,083
- They look great together.
- Yeah.

136
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:32,586
You'd think they were
a couple, wouldn't you?

137
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:36,423
- Aren't they?
- No, not since we were kids.

138
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:16,163
Do you love me?

139
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:18,065
Do you love me?

140
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,654
Yo, cousin, what's she doing here?

141
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,991
She came with me.
She's with me.

142
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:45,893
I carried a watermelon.

143
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,967
I carried a watermelon?

144
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:29,870
Bend your knees. Down.

145
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,109
Watch. Watch my eyes.

146
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,679
Good.

147
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:44,351
That's better.

148
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:51,191
Good. Now roll this way.

149
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,695
Now watch.

150
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:06,373
Look.

151
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:18,919
Love man!

152
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:58,058
Ladies, join our hair-raising
wig show.

153
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,093
Try your Sandra Dee,
Jackie Kennedy...

154
00:21:00,194 --> 00:21:02,896
or Elizabeth Taylor-Cleopatra wig.

155
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:06,433
- I'll knock with three.
- Look at that cute fella.

156
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,769
Look at these hands.
They're golden hands.

157
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:14,441
My God, it's Cleopatra!
I feel like such an ""asp"".

158
00:21:14,508 --> 00:21:16,777
You look ten years younger.

159
00:21:16,844 --> 00:21:19,780
At 10:.15, by the pool,
we have calisthenics.

160
00:21:19,813 --> 00:21:23,116
Then on the west porch, we have
a symposium by Rabbi Maurice Sherman...

161
00:21:23,217 --> 00:21:26,119
on the psychology
of insult comedians.

162
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:30,858
So I say, ""Ask not what your waiter
can do for you...

163
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,427
but what you can do
for your waiter.""

164
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:36,463
If tips keep up, I'll have enough
for my Alfa Romeo.

165
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:39,700
That's my favorite car.

166
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:44,137
Ladies, you look very lovely.

167
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:49,109
Baby, would you cover for me tonight?
Tell Mom and Dad I went to lie down.

168
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,944
Where are you going?

169
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:54,982
To the golf course. There's
a pretty view from the first tee.

170
00:21:58,185 --> 00:22:00,521
Good. Thanks.

171
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:10,831
So you were really a Rockette?

172
00:22:10,898 --> 00:22:12,966
I think you're a wonderful dancer.

173
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:16,470
Yeah? Well, my mother kicked me out
when I was 16.

174
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:20,174
I've been dancing ever since. It's the
only thing I ever wanted to do anyway.

175
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:23,477
I envy you.

176
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:51,371
- Aren't you dancing, Doc?
- We're waiting for a waltz.

177
00:22:52,906 --> 00:22:56,944
Hi, Max. Aren't my dance lessons
starting to pay off?

178
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,514
You look great, Vivian!
Terrific!

179
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,688
That's Vivian Pressman,
one of the bungalow bunnies.

180
00:23:09,356 --> 00:23:12,326
That's what we call the women
who stay here all week.

181
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:16,063
The husbands only come up
on weekends.

182
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:19,499
Moe Pressman's a big card player.
He'll join our game.

183
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:23,904
- Moe coming up on Friday?
- Friday.

184
00:23:24,872 --> 00:23:27,241
He's away a lot. I know.

185
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:30,544
It's a hardship.

186
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:40,254
Where's Penny?
Everybody's been asking for her.

187
00:23:41,722 --> 00:23:45,692
What do you mean, where's Penny?
She's taking a break.

188
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:48,262
As long as it's not
an all-night break.

189
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:54,935
Come on, doll. Let's take a walk.

190
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:07,781
I love to watch your hair
blowing in the breeze.

191
00:24:11,351 --> 00:24:13,620
Maybe my parents
are looking for me.

192
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,455
Baby, don't worry.

193
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:19,293
If they think you're with me, they'll be
the happiest parents at Kellerman's.

194
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:23,430
I have to say it.

195
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:26,500
- I'm known as the catch of the county.
- I'm sure you are.

196
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:29,670
Last week I took a girl away
from Jamie, the lifeguard.

197
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:34,942
And he said to her,
""What does he have that I don't have?""

198
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:38,312
And she said, ""Two hotels.""

199
00:24:40,347 --> 00:24:41,481
Robbie.

200
00:24:42,382 --> 00:24:44,384
I don't hear an apology.

201
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:49,690
Go back to Mommy and Daddy and listen.
Maybe you'll hear one in your dreams.

202
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:54,661
I'm sorry you had
to see that, Baby.

203
00:24:55,596 --> 00:24:58,031
Sometimes in this world...

204
00:24:58,131 --> 00:25:00,667
you see things
you don't wanna see.

205
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:07,174
You hungry?

206
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:09,676
Come on.

207
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:19,686
So, Baby, what do you want?
You can have anything you want.

208
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:23,490
A brownie, some milk...

209
00:25:23,557 --> 00:25:27,060
Ieftover rice pudding,
beets...

210
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,862
cabbage roll...

211
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:35,402
fruit salad, sweet gherkins?

212
00:25:35,435 --> 00:25:39,540
Neil, look, I'm sorry.
I better go check on Lisa.

213
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,375
Yeah.

214
00:26:11,104 --> 00:26:14,107
- Why's she here?
- In case Neil comes back.

215
00:26:14,141 --> 00:26:16,243
Penny just doesn't think.

216
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:19,279
She wouldn't do anything
stupid, would she?

217
00:26:20,113 --> 00:26:23,851
So, what's wrong?
What's the matter with her?

218
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:27,387
- She's knocked up, Baby.
- Billy!

219
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:33,060
- What's he gonna do about it?
- ""What's he gonna do about it?""

220
00:26:33,794 --> 00:26:35,395
It's mine, right?

221
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:38,131
- Right away you think it's mine.
- But I thought...

222
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:58,452
It's okay. Johnny's here.

223
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:05,459
I'm never gonna let anything
happen to you.

224
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,632
We got to go.

225
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:16,136
Just hold on. Just hold on.

226
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,772
Good girl. Good girl.

227
00:27:23,377 --> 00:27:26,380
What do you think you're doing?
You're in trouble, you talk to me.

228
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,916
I'll take care of it.

229
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:32,486
You should've come to me
in the first place.

230
00:27:32,553 --> 00:27:35,956
Forget it, Johnny. I'm not taking
what's left of your salary.

231
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:39,960
- Penny, that's my business.
- Besides, it wouldn't be enough.

232
00:27:49,803 --> 00:27:52,206
Oh, God, it's hopeless!

233
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:54,474
Don't say that.

234
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:57,511
There's gotta be a way
to work it out.

235
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:03,483
Baby? Is that your name?

236
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:06,153
You know what, Baby?

237
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:09,656
You don't know shit
about my problems.

238
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:12,826
I told her.

239
00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:18,365
Jesus! She's gonna tell her management
boyfriend and then we'll all get fired.

240
00:28:18,432 --> 00:28:22,736
Why not skywrite it? ""Penny got
knocked up by Robbie, the creep.""

241
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:25,439
- Look--
- No, Baby.

242
00:28:26,673 --> 00:28:29,510
One of the counselors
knows a doctor, a real M.D....

243
00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:32,579
just traveling through New Paltz
one day next week.

244
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:35,449
We can get an appointment,
but it costs $250.

245
00:28:35,516 --> 00:28:39,152
But if it's Robbie, there's no problem.
I know he has the money.

246
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:41,688
- I'm sure if you tell him--
- He knows.

247
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:53,300
Go back to your playpen, Baby.

248
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:03,277
- Why should you tell me what's right?
- You can't just leave her.

249
00:29:03,277 --> 00:29:06,880
- Why should you tell me what's right?
- You can't just leave her.

250
00:29:06,947 --> 00:29:10,450
I didn't blow a summer hauling bagels
just to bail out some chick...

251
00:29:10,551 --> 00:29:12,819
who probably slept
with every guy here.

252
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:14,888
A little precision, please.

253
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:20,894
Some people count
and some people don't.

254
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:23,730
Read it.

255
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:29,469
I think you'll enjoy it. But return it.
I have notes in there.

256
00:29:31,805 --> 00:29:35,008
You make me sick.
Stay away from me.

257
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:39,379
Stay away from my sister
or I'll have you fired.

258
00:29:53,694 --> 00:29:55,662
What am I doing wrong?

259
00:29:55,762 --> 00:29:58,665
You're lining it up
a little wrong, Marge.

260
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:03,036
If your mother ever leaves me,
it'll be for Arnold Palmer.

261
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:05,939
- Daddy, someone's in trouble.
- Besides your mother?

262
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:08,108
You're overcorrecting, Marge.

263
00:30:09,176 --> 00:30:12,613
You always told me if someone
was in trouble, I should help.

264
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:14,615
Could you lend me $250?

265
00:30:16,116 --> 00:30:18,352
Are you all right?
Are you in trouble?

266
00:30:18,418 --> 00:30:21,421
No, it's not me.
Could you loan it to me?

267
00:30:21,455 --> 00:30:24,057
That's a lot of money.
What's it for?

268
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:26,260
Baby, stand up straight.

269
00:30:27,127 --> 00:30:29,196
I can't tell you.

270
00:30:29,296 --> 00:30:32,533
It's hard for me to say that to you,
but I can't.

271
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:35,369
You always said you could
tell me anything.

272
00:30:35,435 --> 00:30:37,804
I can't tell you this.

273
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:42,309
It's not illegal, is it?

274
00:30:44,578 --> 00:30:46,647
No, Daddy.

275
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:52,052
That was a stupid thing to ask.
Forgive me.

276
00:30:53,587 --> 00:30:55,656
I'll have it for you before dinner.

277
00:30:55,722 --> 00:30:58,325
- Is everything all right?
- Fine.

278
00:30:58,392 --> 00:31:00,327
Thanks, Daddy.

279
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,389
Here's the money.

280
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:08,128
- You mean Robbie?
- No. You were right about him?

281
00:32:08,228 --> 00:32:11,732
- Then where'd you get it?
- You said you needed it.

282
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:16,336
- Is this kid for real?
- Takes a real saint to ask Daddy.

283
00:32:21,642 --> 00:32:24,011
Thanks, Baby, but I can't use it.

284
00:32:28,348 --> 00:32:32,252
What? What's the matter with you?
You should take the money.

285
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:35,722
I can only get her an appointment
for Thursday.

286
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:38,091
They do their act
at the Sheldrake Thursday.

287
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:41,995
If they cancel, they lose this
season's salary and next year's gig.

288
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:43,630
What's the Sheldrake?

289
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:47,734
It's another hotel
where they do their mambo act.

290
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:50,470
Can't someone else fill in?

291
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:54,441
No, ""Miss Fix-it.""
Somebody else can't.

292
00:32:54,508 --> 00:32:57,611
Maria has to work all day.
She can't learn the routines.

293
00:32:57,678 --> 00:33:00,781
And Janet has to fill in for Penny.
Everybody works here.

294
00:33:01,582 --> 00:33:04,451
You wanna do it?
Take time out from ""Simon Says""?

295
00:33:06,954 --> 00:33:08,856
It's not a bad idea.

296
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:11,291
It was a 5oke.

297
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:15,829
- She can move.
- It's the dumbest idea I ever heard of.

298
00:33:15,896 --> 00:33:18,332
- I can't even do the merengue.
- See?

299
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:20,968
You're a strong partner.
You can lead anybody.

300
00:33:21,034 --> 00:33:24,771
She can't even do the merengue.
She cannot do it.

301
00:33:30,143 --> 00:33:32,412
- No!
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.

302
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:35,015
You don't step on the one.

303
00:33:35,082 --> 00:33:38,852
You gotta start on the two.
Find the two. Understand?

304
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:43,423
-I never did any of these dances before.
-It's one, two, three, four.

305
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:47,227
When the music starts, you don't
dance until the two. Got it?

306
00:33:47,327 --> 00:33:49,329
Relax, relax.

307
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:51,164
Breathe.

308
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:53,500
Frame.

309
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:55,169
Nope.

310
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,177
Again.

311
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,212
Ow.

312
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,348
Two, three, four.
Two, three, four.

313
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:11,051
Don't lean back. Lifting up.

314
00:34:11,118 --> 00:34:13,520
Two, three, four.
Shoulders down.

315
00:34:20,294 --> 00:34:22,829
Again. Concentrate. And...

316
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,472
Don't put your heel down.

317
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:08,342
- Don't put your heel down.
- I didn't--

318
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:10,878
Stay on the toe.
Just listen to me.

319
00:35:10,911 --> 00:35:13,247
The steps aren't enough.

320
00:35:13,313 --> 00:35:15,349
Feel the music.

321
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:37,804
It's not on the one.
It's not the mambo.

322
00:35:37,804 --> 00:35:40,440
It's not on the one.
It's not the mambo.

323
00:35:40,507 --> 00:35:43,544
It's a feeling, a heartbeat.

324
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:52,719
Don't try so hard.

325
00:35:57,124 --> 00:35:59,092
Close your eyes.

326
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:08,302
Two, three, four.
Two, three, four.

327
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:12,940
Breathe.

328
00:36:25,552 --> 00:36:28,555
Head up.
Lock your frame. Lock it.

329
00:36:28,655 --> 00:36:30,557
Look, spaghetti arm.

330
00:36:31,425 --> 00:36:34,695
This is my dance space.
This is your dance space.

331
00:36:34,761 --> 00:36:38,232
I don't go into yours. You don't
go into mine. You gotta hold the frame.

332
00:36:38,332 --> 00:36:40,133
Again.

333
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,768
Frame.

334
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:36,343
Back. Easy.

335
00:39:36,343 --> 00:39:38,345
Back. Easy.

336
00:39:39,947 --> 00:39:43,717
And turn, turn. Down.
And lift. You'll learn that later.

337
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,686
And come on.

338
00:39:45,752 --> 00:39:47,721
Down. Twist.

339
00:39:47,754 --> 00:39:49,389
And the bow.

340
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:52,426
- Sorry. Sorry.
- You trying to kill me?

341
00:39:52,526 --> 00:39:56,763
You gotta concentrate!
Is that your idea of fun?

342
00:39:56,864 --> 00:39:59,099
As a matter of fact it is.

343
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:03,070
We do the show in two days, you won't
show me lifts, I'm not sure of turns.

344
00:40:03,103 --> 00:40:06,740
I'm doing all this to save your ass,
but I'd rather drop you on it!

345
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:10,077
Let's leave.

346
00:40:16,783 --> 00:40:18,519
Shit!

347
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:23,156
I locked the keys in the car!

348
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:48,015
You're getting wet, right?

349
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:02,629
- You're wild.
- What?

350
00:41:02,663 --> 00:41:04,865
You're wild!

351
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,365
Now, the most important thing
to remember in lifts is balance.

352
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:41,134
Whoa! Whoa!

353
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:48,876
I got it now.

354
00:41:48,976 --> 00:41:51,879
So where'd you learn
to be a dancer?

355
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,984
Well, this guy came into
this luncheonette one day and...

356
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:00,254
we were all sitting around
doing nothing.

357
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,891
And he said that Arthur Murray
was giving a test for instructors.

358
00:42:03,991 --> 00:42:06,260
So, if you passed...

359
00:42:10,497 --> 00:42:15,269
they teach you different dances, show
you how to break them down, teach them.

360
00:42:18,939 --> 00:42:20,274
What?

361
00:42:29,116 --> 00:42:30,884
Good.

362
00:42:31,685 --> 00:42:35,889
Don't look down.
Look here. Good.

363
00:42:35,956 --> 00:42:37,658
And...

364
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,803
Now, bend your knees
and go up. Go, go.

365
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:28,876
Good try. Now, you'll hurt me
if you don't trust me, all right?

366
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:30,878
Now, go, go. Go.

367
00:43:33,347 --> 00:43:35,682
Good. Now, I'm gonna go up.

368
00:43:42,923 --> 00:43:46,193
You know, the best place
to practice lifts is in the water.

369
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:48,795
Just bend your knees.
And... go.

370
00:43:49,696 --> 00:43:51,265
Good.

371
00:43:51,331 --> 00:43:52,933
Good. Good.

372
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,102
Now hold the position. Hold it.

373
00:43:55,169 --> 00:43:57,337
Good. Don't break! Don't break!

374
00:44:10,717 --> 00:44:12,653
Let's do it again.

375
00:44:15,455 --> 00:44:19,293
All right. One, two, three.

376
00:44:20,561 --> 00:44:22,362
Oh, sorry.

377
00:44:23,564 --> 00:44:25,866
Good. Keep-- No, don't.

378
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,382
It's not too bad.

379
00:44:45,752 --> 00:44:48,722
- One more time.
- Okay. Over my head. Go.

380
00:44:50,424 --> 00:44:50,524
I can't believe it's tonight.

381
00:44:50,524 --> 00:44:52,826
I can't believe it's tonight.

382
00:44:52,893 --> 00:44:56,063
Sheldrake's 20 minutes away.
We'll change in the car.

383
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:01,835
Mrs. Schumacher.
Hey, wait, we'll help you.

384
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,573
Such junk. Such junk.

385
00:45:08,141 --> 00:45:13,080
Benny Bernstein's Dancing School,
that's where I went.

386
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,883
George Burns was a teacher.

387
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:19,686
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

388
00:45:24,424 --> 00:45:24,458
I'll just keep my shoulders down,
my head up...

389
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:27,227
I'll just keep my shoulders down,
my head up...

390
00:45:27,294 --> 00:45:30,430
my frame locked,
stay on my toes...

391
00:45:30,531 --> 00:45:32,566
What if I forget the steps?

392
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:36,170
Pull up, watch the frame.
And remember, let him lead you.

393
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:40,574
I'm afraid I'm gonna forget to spike,
get dizzy and fall on my face.

394
00:45:40,607 --> 00:45:45,546
No. Don't look at my feet,
keep my head up, my eyes open...

395
00:45:45,612 --> 00:45:49,583
tension in my arms, my frame locked,
seat pulled up...

396
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,618
Thanks, Baby.

397
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:57,357
I just want you to know
that I don't sleep around...

398
00:45:57,424 --> 00:46:00,460
whatever Robbie might have told you.

399
00:46:00,561 --> 00:46:03,297
And I thought that he loved me.

400
00:46:04,198 --> 00:46:06,466
I thought it was something special.

401
00:46:07,634 --> 00:46:10,470
Anyway, I just wanted you
to know that.

402
00:46:14,508 --> 00:46:16,810
So, how does it look?

403
00:46:24,585 --> 00:46:26,153
I'm scared.

404
00:46:28,622 --> 00:46:30,991
I'm so scared, Baby.

405
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:33,927
Don't worry.

406
00:46:34,528 --> 00:46:36,463
You'll be fine.

407
00:46:41,602 --> 00:46:45,606
Bingo! Bingo! Bingo! That's right.
It's Thursday night at Kellerman's.

408
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:47,608
That's bingo night.

409
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:51,411
- Hey, how about a dance later?
- Could be. Who knows?

410
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:54,848
- Lisa, you have to do something for me.
- I don't have to.

411
00:46:54,948 --> 00:46:59,286
Just tell Mom and Dad I have a headache
and I'm in bed, okay?

412
00:47:01,822 --> 00:47:03,357
Bye.

413
00:47:05,025 --> 00:47:05,125
The Sheldrake Hotel is proud to present
Johnny Castle and partner...

414
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:09,496
The Sheldrake Hotel is proud to present
Johnny Castle and partner...

415
00:47:09,563 --> 00:47:11,865
in ""Mambo Magic.""

416
00:47:15,569 --> 00:47:17,037
Relax.

417
00:47:49,736 --> 00:47:51,939
Now spot a lead.

418
00:48:20,968 --> 00:48:22,903
Wrong way!

419
00:48:31,144 --> 00:48:33,080
Over here.

420
00:48:40,687 --> 00:48:42,456
Ready for the lift?

421
00:48:44,892 --> 00:48:46,226
Come on.

422
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,068
Keep going. Keep going.

423
00:49:38,212 --> 00:49:41,682
...because wherever you are now,
I want you to look at the sky.

424
00:49:41,782 --> 00:49:46,019
Look at those stars.
What a show. Here are The Drifters.

425
00:49:47,054 --> 00:49:49,022
You did good. You worked hard.

426
00:49:49,056 --> 00:49:51,692
I saw that old couple from Kellerman's
and I thought that was it.

427
00:49:51,758 --> 00:49:53,760
Me too. Me too.

428
00:49:55,362 --> 00:49:58,065
You know, by the second turn
you really had it.

429
00:49:58,165 --> 00:50:01,702
- But I didn't do the lift.
- You did real good.

430
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,399
Thanks.

431
00:51:08,669 --> 00:51:10,237
Johnny!

432
00:51:10,304 --> 00:51:13,106
Come on. It's Penny.

433
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:17,311
- She wouldn't go until you returned.
- Did you call an ambulance?

434
00:51:17,377 --> 00:51:20,080
She said the hospital would call
the police. She made me promise.

435
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,983
He didn't use no ether, nothing.

436
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:28,188
- I thought you said he was a real M.D.?
- He had a dirty knife and a table.

437
00:51:28,288 --> 00:51:30,557
I could hear her screaming
in the hallway.

438
00:51:30,657 --> 00:51:33,560
I swear to God,
I tried to get in.

439
00:51:35,696 --> 00:51:38,498
It's all right. Johnny's here.

440
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:54,214
What? What is it, Baby?

441
00:51:55,415 --> 00:51:57,584
- Is it Lisa?
- No.

442
00:52:13,066 --> 00:52:16,603
Excuse me. Excuse me!
Everybody clear out, please.

443
00:52:27,214 --> 00:52:30,417
Yes, I know that hurts.
We're gonna take care of that.

444
00:52:33,987 --> 00:52:37,758
- Who's responsible for this girl?
- I am.

445
00:52:37,858 --> 00:52:40,194
Please, is she--

446
00:52:57,911 --> 00:52:59,880
Doc, thanks a lot.

447
00:52:59,913 --> 00:53:03,217
I don't know how to thank you.

448
00:53:13,227 --> 00:53:16,730
- Was that what my money paid for?
- I'm sorry. I never meant to lie.

449
00:53:16,797 --> 00:53:20,400
You're not the person I thought
you were. I'm not sure who you are.

450
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:22,836
I don't want you to have anything
to do with those people.

451
00:53:22,936 --> 00:53:26,974
Nothing! You're to have nothing
to do with them ever again!

452
00:53:27,074 --> 00:53:30,644
I won't tell your mother about this.
Right now I'm going to bed.

453
00:53:30,744 --> 00:53:34,081
And take that stuff off your face
before your mother sees you!

454
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:40,921
Is everything all right, Jake?

455
00:53:40,988 --> 00:53:44,424
It's all right, Marjorie.
Go back to sleep.

456
00:54:04,178 --> 00:54:06,113
Can I come in?

457
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:22,262
I got a-- I guess it's not a great room.
You probably got a great room.

458
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:24,798
No. It's a great room!

459
00:54:35,809 --> 00:54:37,211
Leave it on.

460
00:54:39,646 --> 00:54:42,349
I'm sorry about the way
my father treated you.

461
00:54:44,151 --> 00:54:46,854
No. Your father was great.

462
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,624
He was great.
The way he took care of Penny.

463
00:54:50,657 --> 00:54:53,760
I mean the way he was with you.

464
00:54:53,861 --> 00:54:56,330
It's really me it has to do with.

465
00:54:58,665 --> 00:55:01,668
Johnny, I came here
because my father--

466
00:55:01,735 --> 00:55:05,405
No. The way he saved her--
I could never do anything like that.

467
00:55:05,506 --> 00:55:09,476
That was something. People treat me
like I'm nothing because I am nothing.

468
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:13,347
That's not true!
You're everything!

469
00:55:15,115 --> 00:55:18,318
You don't understand the way it is
for somebody like me.

470
00:55:18,385 --> 00:55:20,587
Last month I'm eating candy
to stay alive.

471
00:55:20,687 --> 00:55:23,657
This month, women are stuffing
diamonds in my pockets.

472
00:55:23,724 --> 00:55:25,959
I'm balancing on shit
and I can be down there again.

473
00:55:26,026 --> 00:55:29,663
No, it's not the way it is!
It doesn't have to be that way!

474
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:35,669
I've never known anyone like you.
You think you can make the world better.

475
00:55:35,702 --> 00:55:37,804
Somebody's lost, you find them.
Somebody's bleeding--

476
00:55:37,871 --> 00:55:41,742
I go get my daddy.
That's really brave, like you said.

477
00:55:41,808 --> 00:55:44,678
That took a lot of guts
to go to him!

478
00:55:44,711 --> 00:55:46,813
You are not scared of anything.

479
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,051
I'm scared of everything!
I'm scared of what I saw.

480
00:55:51,118 --> 00:55:54,755
I'm scared of what I did,
who I am.

481
00:55:54,821 --> 00:56:00,160
I'm scared of walking out of here and
never feeling for the rest of my life...

482
00:56:00,227 --> 00:56:02,462
the way I feel
when I'm with you!

483
00:56:24,184 --> 00:56:26,119
Dance with me.

484
00:56:28,255 --> 00:56:30,023
What, here?

485
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:31,758
Here.

486
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:35,075
Singers, dancers, actors,
this is your lucky day!

487
00:59:35,142 --> 00:59:38,545
Auditions for the annual Kellerman
end-of-the-season talent show...

488
00:59:38,645 --> 00:59:40,647
beginning in the playhouse.

489
00:59:47,487 --> 00:59:50,324
- Everyone gonna be in the show?
- We're leaving tomorrow.

490
00:59:50,357 --> 00:59:52,526
Miss the weekend traffic.

491
00:59:52,626 --> 00:59:54,494
But we're paid up 'til Sunday.

492
00:59:54,528 --> 00:59:57,531
- And miss the show?
- I said we're leaving tomorrow.

493
00:59:57,631 --> 01:00:00,634
- I was going to sing in the show.
- It's the big event.

494
01:00:00,667 --> 01:00:03,036
People bring their own arrangements.
You don't want to miss it.

495
01:00:03,136 --> 01:00:05,138
Baby, I need you for props.

496
01:00:06,673 --> 01:00:09,843
Why would you want to leave early?

497
01:00:16,817 --> 01:00:19,653
It was just an idea.
We can stay if you want to.

498
01:00:23,357 --> 01:00:26,960
- So, what were you planning to sing?
- ""l Feel Pretty.""

499
01:00:27,027 --> 01:00:30,030
Or ""What Do the Simple Folk Do?""

500
01:00:30,063 --> 01:00:33,867
Or ""l Feel Pretty.""
What do you think, Daddy?

501
01:00:45,879 --> 01:00:47,314
You look much better.

502
01:00:50,017 --> 01:00:53,554
You just missed your father.
He's such a wonderful man.

503
01:00:55,422 --> 01:00:57,991
I'm sorry. I didn't realize--

504
01:00:58,058 --> 01:01:00,394
You couldn't have. It's okay.

505
01:01:12,406 --> 01:01:15,209
- So, how you doin'?
- I'm okay.

506
01:01:16,777 --> 01:01:19,246
Dr. Houseman says
I'm going to be fine.

507
01:01:20,581 --> 01:01:24,384
- I can still have children.
- Oh, Penny, that's really great.

508
01:01:26,954 --> 01:01:29,723
So, how did it go last night?

509
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:31,758
Good.

510
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:37,564
Fine. I didn't do the lifts,
but it was good.

511
01:01:48,275 --> 01:01:52,980
Well, I guess I gonna go.

512
01:01:55,148 --> 01:01:56,783
See ya.

513
01:02:04,858 --> 01:02:07,160
- So, he says you're going to be fine?
- What are you doing?

514
01:02:07,261 --> 01:02:10,697
- I'll tell Max your grandmother died.
- How many times have you told me...

515
01:02:10,797 --> 01:02:13,534
never get mixed-up with them?

516
01:02:13,634 --> 01:02:15,536
I know what I'm doing.

517
01:02:16,637 --> 01:02:20,407
You listen to me.
You've got to stop it now.

518
01:02:36,356 --> 01:02:39,560
Look, I gotta run.
I got a lesson with the Kramers.

519
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:42,029
They'll kill each other
if I'm not there.

520
01:02:42,095 --> 01:02:44,531
Well, sure. You've gotta go.

521
01:02:47,334 --> 01:02:48,735
I'll see ya.

522
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:11,191
It's rainy day game time.
Pin the tail on the guest.

523
01:03:11,291 --> 01:03:13,694
Win ten boxes of Kleenex
or a billy goat!

524
01:03:14,761 --> 01:03:18,232
God, I am so sick of this rain.

525
01:03:18,332 --> 01:03:21,034
Remind me not to take my honeymoon
at Niagara Falls.

526
01:03:21,101 --> 01:03:24,238
So, you go to Acapulco.
It'll be fine.

527
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:27,941
Where is my beige
iridescent lipstick?

528
01:03:28,041 --> 01:03:30,210
I know I put it in this drawer.

529
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:32,513
Baby, where are you going
in this weather?

530
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:35,182
Uh, they're having charades
in the west lobby.

531
01:03:35,249 --> 01:03:38,185
Quite the little joiner,
aren't we?

532
01:03:52,966 --> 01:03:56,336
- Have you had many women?
- What?

533
01:03:59,106 --> 01:04:00,941
Baby, come on.

534
01:04:00,974 --> 01:04:02,943
Tell me. I want to know.

535
01:04:14,788 --> 01:04:16,924
You gotta understand
what it's like.

536
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:19,426
You come from the streets
and suddenly you're up here.

537
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:23,397
Women are throwing themselves
at you and they smell so good.

538
01:04:23,463 --> 01:04:25,566
They really take care
of themselves.

539
01:04:25,632 --> 01:04:28,068
I never knew women
could be like that.

540
01:04:28,135 --> 01:04:31,405
They're so goddamn rich you think
they must know about everything.

541
01:04:31,471 --> 01:04:34,174
They're slippin' their room keys
in my hand two and three times a day--

542
01:04:34,241 --> 01:04:38,445
different women--
so, I think I'm scorin' big, right?

543
01:04:38,545 --> 01:04:42,950
You think, ""They wouldn't be doing this
if they didn't care about me, right?""

544
01:04:44,151 --> 01:04:47,120
That's all right. I understand.
You were just using them, that's all.

545
01:04:49,089 --> 01:04:50,557
No, that's not it.

546
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:53,760
That's the thing.
It wasn't like that.

547
01:04:55,863 --> 01:04:57,965
They were using me.

548
01:05:25,526 --> 01:05:27,461
What's your real name, Baby?

549
01:05:29,463 --> 01:05:33,634
Frances, for the first woman
in the Cabinet.

550
01:05:35,836 --> 01:05:39,206
Frances.
That's a real grownup name.

551
01:05:52,386 --> 01:05:54,821
I've decided to go
all the way with Robbie.

552
01:05:57,391 --> 01:06:01,094
No, not with someone like him.

553
01:06:01,161 --> 01:06:05,532
Do you think if we came back for a
ten-year anniversary, it would be free?

554
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:09,102
It's just wrong this way.
It should be with someone--

555
01:06:09,203 --> 01:06:13,807
With someone that
you sort of love.

556
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:18,078
Come on.
You don't care about me.

557
01:06:18,178 --> 01:06:21,181
You wouldn't care if I humped
the entire army...

558
01:06:21,248 --> 01:06:24,418
as long as we were on the right side
of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

559
01:06:24,518 --> 01:06:29,356
What you care about is that
you're not Daddy's girl anymore.

560
01:06:29,389 --> 01:06:31,859
He listens when I talk now.

561
01:06:32,993 --> 01:06:34,394
You hate that.

562
01:06:51,578 --> 01:06:54,314
Two, three, cha-cha-cha.

563
01:06:54,414 --> 01:06:57,284
My frame.
Where's my pleasing arc?

564
01:06:57,384 --> 01:07:00,921
Spaghetti arms! Would you
give me some tension, please?

565
01:07:02,789 --> 01:07:06,159
You're invading my dance space.
This is my dance space.

566
01:07:06,226 --> 01:07:08,629
That's yours. Let's cha-cha.

567
01:07:14,801 --> 01:07:17,471
Don't look down.
Look right here.

568
01:07:26,413 --> 01:07:31,151
- How you call your lover boy?
- Come here, lover boy.

569
01:07:31,251 --> 01:07:34,788
- And if he doesn't answer?
- Oh, lover boy.

570
01:07:34,888 --> 01:07:38,258
- And if still doesn't answer?
- I simply say...

571
01:07:38,292 --> 01:07:41,061
Baby

572
01:07:41,128 --> 01:07:43,964
O-Oh, baby

573
01:07:45,065 --> 01:07:47,901
My sweet baby

574
01:07:48,936 --> 01:07:50,904
You're the one

575
01:08:06,286 --> 01:08:07,788
Takin' dance lessons?

576
01:08:08,822 --> 01:08:10,791
I could teach ya, kid.

577
01:08:15,495 --> 01:08:18,465
My grandfather put me in charge
of the final show.

578
01:08:18,532 --> 01:08:20,834
I want to talk to you
about the last dance.

579
01:08:20,934 --> 01:08:24,004
I'd like to shake things up a bit.

580
01:08:24,104 --> 01:08:26,707
You know, move with the times.

581
01:08:26,807 --> 01:08:28,809
I've got a lot of ideas.

582
01:08:28,876 --> 01:08:30,978
I've been working
with the staff kids...

583
01:08:31,011 --> 01:08:34,548
on a cross between a Cuban rhythm
and soul dancing.

584
01:08:34,648 --> 01:08:37,417
Whoa, boy.

585
01:08:37,518 --> 01:08:39,753
Way over your head here.

586
01:08:39,853 --> 01:08:43,824
You always do the mambo, huh?

587
01:08:43,891 --> 01:08:47,127
Why not dance this year's
final dance...

588
01:08:49,162 --> 01:08:51,031
to the pachenga?

589
01:08:52,199 --> 01:08:53,333
Right.

590
01:08:55,536 --> 01:08:59,239
Well, you're free to do the same,
tired number as last year if you want...

591
01:08:59,339 --> 01:09:02,242
but next year we'll find
another dance person...

592
01:09:02,342 --> 01:09:04,711
- who'll only be too happy--
- Sure, Neil. No problem.

593
01:09:06,914 --> 01:09:09,082
We'll end the season
with the pachenga.

594
01:09:09,183 --> 01:09:10,617
Great idea.

595
01:09:17,191 --> 01:09:21,562
Sometimes he's hard to talk to,
but the ladies seem to like him.

596
01:09:21,595 --> 01:09:24,598
See that he gives you the full half-hour
you're paying him for, kid.

597
01:09:33,473 --> 01:09:36,543
That little wimp. He wouldn't know a
new idea if it hit him in the pachenga.

598
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:38,912
I could have told him
some new ideas.

599
01:09:39,012 --> 01:09:41,014
Why did you let him
talk to you that way?

600
01:09:41,081 --> 01:09:43,550
- What, fight the boss man?
- You tell him your ideas.

601
01:09:43,617 --> 01:09:46,420
- He's a person like everyone else.
- Look, I know these people.

602
01:09:46,486 --> 01:09:49,189
They are rich and they're mean.
They won't listen to me.

603
01:09:49,256 --> 01:09:51,658
Why not fight harder?
Make them listen.

604
01:09:51,758 --> 01:09:54,628
Because I need this goddamned job
lined up for next summer.

605
01:09:55,729 --> 01:09:57,798
My dad calls me today.

606
01:09:57,898 --> 01:10:00,501
""Good news,"" he says. ""Uncle Paul
can finally get you in the union.""

607
01:10:00,601 --> 01:10:01,835
What union?

608
01:10:03,036 --> 01:10:06,940
The House Painters and Plasterers
Local Number 179 at your service.

609
01:10:15,082 --> 01:10:17,618
I've been thinking a lot
about the Domino Theory.

610
01:10:17,684 --> 01:10:20,053
Now, when Viet Nam falls,
is China Next?

611
01:10:22,856 --> 01:10:24,791
I don't think they saw us.

612
01:10:35,969 --> 01:10:37,437
Fight harder, huh?

613
01:10:38,472 --> 01:10:42,242
I don't see you fightin' so hard,
tellin' Daddy I'm your guy.

614
01:10:42,309 --> 01:10:44,478
I will. With my father,
it's complicated.

615
01:10:44,545 --> 01:10:46,980
- I will tell him.
- I don't believe you, Baby.

616
01:10:50,651 --> 01:10:52,119
I don't think...

617
01:10:53,654 --> 01:10:56,423
that you ever had
any intention of telling him.

618
01:10:57,491 --> 01:10:58,625
Ever.

619
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:09,670
Well, Cousin, it's almost over.
Labor Day weekend is here.

620
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:12,506
Well, Cousin, it's almost over.
Labor Day weekend is here.

621
01:11:12,539 --> 01:11:16,276
Soon it's back to the old books and
back to work. What a terrible thought!

622
01:11:26,019 --> 01:11:27,988
Have you seen Johnny?

623
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:45,072
I'm sorry.

624
01:11:49,543 --> 01:11:51,478
Looks like I picked
the wrong sister.

625
01:11:51,545 --> 01:11:54,348
That's okay, Baby.
I went slummin' too.

626
01:12:12,199 --> 01:12:13,867
Hit me.

627
01:12:20,941 --> 01:12:22,910
Get out of here.
You're not worth it.

628
01:13:21,101 --> 01:13:23,303
Win big, Moe.

629
01:13:23,403 --> 01:13:24,638
As always.

630
01:13:42,189 --> 01:13:46,026
This is our last night together, lover.
I've got something worked out for us.

631
01:14:08,682 --> 01:14:10,984
Excuse me, sir.
The pirate number's next.

632
01:14:11,051 --> 01:14:13,353
Oh, thanks.
Hey, kid.

633
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:16,156
I've been playing cards all weekend
and I've got an all-night game tonight.

634
01:14:16,223 --> 01:14:19,726
Why don't you give my wife
some extra dance lessons?

635
01:14:28,802 --> 01:14:30,704
I'm sorry, Mr. Pressman...

636
01:14:30,804 --> 01:14:33,273
but I'm booked up for
the whole weekend with the show.

637
01:14:33,373 --> 01:14:35,576
I won't have time
for anything else.

638
01:14:35,642 --> 01:14:38,846
I don't think it'd be fair
to take the money.

639
01:15:03,604 --> 01:15:06,440
I've decided tonight's the night
with Robbie.

640
01:15:06,473 --> 01:15:08,675
He doesn't even know yet.

641
01:15:44,411 --> 01:15:45,646
It's me.

642
01:15:50,817 --> 01:15:52,152
Holy shit!

643
01:16:13,207 --> 01:16:15,309
You wanna hear somethin' crazy?

644
01:16:19,646 --> 01:16:21,114
Last night l--

645
01:16:22,282 --> 01:16:26,553
I dreamt we were walking along
and we met your father.

646
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:29,289
He said, ""Come on,""
and he put his arm around me.

647
01:16:30,991 --> 01:16:33,093
Just like he did with Robbie.

648
01:17:20,374 --> 01:17:25,612
You know how you feel when you see a
patient and you think he's all right...

649
01:17:25,712 --> 01:17:28,682
then you look at the X rays
and it's nothing like you thought?

650
01:17:28,715 --> 01:17:29,983
What happened?

651
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:33,520
It's exactly what it's like when you
find out one of your staff's a thief.

652
01:17:33,554 --> 01:17:37,224
Moe Pressman's wallet was stolen
when he was playing pinochle last night.

653
01:17:37,324 --> 01:17:40,327
It was in his jacket hanging
on the back of his chair.

654
01:17:40,394 --> 01:17:44,631
He had it at 1:30 and when he
checked again at quarter of 4::00...

655
01:17:44,698 --> 01:17:47,100
it was missing.

656
01:17:47,201 --> 01:17:51,705
Vivian thinks she remembers
this dance kid Johnny...

657
01:17:51,772 --> 01:17:53,040
walking by.

658
01:17:54,107 --> 01:17:58,011
So we ask him,
""You have an alibi for last night?""

659
01:17:58,045 --> 01:18:00,280
He says he was alone
in his room reading.

660
01:18:01,648 --> 01:18:04,084
There are no books
in Johnny's room!

661
01:18:06,053 --> 01:18:08,121
There's been a mistake.
I know Johnny didn't do it.

662
01:18:08,222 --> 01:18:10,657
There's been similar thefts at the
Sheldrake. It's happened here before.

663
01:18:10,724 --> 01:18:13,093
- Three other wallets.
- I know he didn't do it.

664
01:18:13,193 --> 01:18:15,262
Stay out of it, Baby.

665
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:19,199
Wait. Don't put those
tables together. Come on.

666
01:18:21,435 --> 01:18:25,506
Daddy, I need your help.
I know Johnny didn't take Moe's wallet.

667
01:18:25,572 --> 01:18:27,941
- Oh? How do you know?
- I can't tell you.

668
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:32,813
- Just please trust me, Daddy.
- I'm sorry, Baby. I can't.

669
01:18:32,913 --> 01:18:34,982
This Danish is pure protein.

670
01:18:37,818 --> 01:18:41,522
Maybe Johnny didn't do it.
Anyone could've taken it.

671
01:18:41,588 --> 01:18:43,524
Maybe it was, uh--

672
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:46,460
It could've been that little,
old couple, the Schumachers.

673
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:49,763
- I saw her with a couple of wallets.
- Sylvia and Sidney?

674
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:52,866
Baby, you don't go around
accusing innocent people.

675
01:18:52,966 --> 01:18:57,437
I even saw them at the Sheldrake. You
said something was stolen from there.

676
01:18:57,504 --> 01:19:01,108
I got an eyewitness
and the kid has no alibi.

677
01:19:01,175 --> 01:19:05,112
Come on, Neil. You'll learn
what it's like to fire an employee.

678
01:19:06,313 --> 01:19:09,816
Wait a minute. I know Johnny
didn't take the wallet.

679
01:19:09,883 --> 01:19:13,120
I know because he was
in his room all night.

680
01:19:13,187 --> 01:19:17,691
And the reason I know
is because I was with him.

681
01:19:42,115 --> 01:19:44,017
I told you I was
telling the truth.

682
01:19:48,889 --> 01:19:50,858
I'm sorry I lied to you.

683
01:19:53,727 --> 01:19:55,696
But you lied too.

684
01:19:57,898 --> 01:20:01,468
You told me everyone was alike
and deserved a fair break.

685
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:03,637
But you meant everyone
who is like you.

686
01:20:06,373 --> 01:20:09,643
You told me you wanted me to change
the world, to make it better.

687
01:20:10,711 --> 01:20:13,347
But you meant by becoming
a lawyer or an economist...

688
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:15,549
and marrying someone
from Harvard.

689
01:20:18,218 --> 01:20:20,754
I'm not proud of myself.

690
01:20:20,854 --> 01:20:24,358
But I'm in this family too. You can't
keep giving me the silent treatment.

691
01:20:27,895 --> 01:20:30,731
There are a lot of things about me
that aren't what you thought.

692
01:20:31,765 --> 01:20:34,735
But if you love me, you have to love
all the things about me.

693
01:20:37,404 --> 01:20:39,339
And I love you.

694
01:20:39,406 --> 01:20:43,977
I'm sorry I let you down.
I'm so sorry, Daddy.

695
01:20:44,878 --> 01:20:47,114
But you let me down too.

696
01:21:17,411 --> 01:21:19,613
I have been lookin'
for you all over.

697
01:21:20,614 --> 01:21:22,449
They found the Schumachers.

698
01:21:22,549 --> 01:21:24,852
Fingerprinted their water glasses.

699
01:21:24,952 --> 01:21:27,788
Found out they were wanted
in Arizona and in Florida...

700
01:21:27,855 --> 01:21:30,290
and they made a fortune
here this summer.

701
01:21:30,324 --> 01:21:32,292
So then it's all right.

702
01:21:33,427 --> 01:21:35,429
I knew it would work out.

703
01:21:35,495 --> 01:21:37,798
- I knew they'd have to apologize.
- I'm out, Baby.

704
01:21:43,036 --> 01:21:44,972
They fired you anyway
because of me.

705
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:49,977
And if I leave quietly,
I'll get my summer bonus.

706
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:54,882
So I did it for nothing.

707
01:21:54,982 --> 01:21:58,986
I hurt my family, you lost your job
anyway-- I did it for nothing!

708
01:21:59,052 --> 01:22:00,988
No, not for nothing.

709
01:22:01,054 --> 01:22:04,424
Nobody has ever done anything
like that for me before.

710
01:22:05,192 --> 01:22:08,428
You were right. You can't win
no matter what you do.

711
01:22:08,495 --> 01:22:11,965
Listen to me. I don't want
to hear that from you. You can.

712
01:22:13,867 --> 01:22:15,969
I used to think so.

713
01:22:37,558 --> 01:22:39,660
Dr. Houseman, can l, uh--

714
01:22:41,161 --> 01:22:44,198
Look, I'm going anyway and I know
what you must be thinking.

715
01:22:44,264 --> 01:22:47,234
You don't know
anything at all about me.

716
01:22:47,334 --> 01:22:50,037
I know you want Baby
to be like you.

717
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:52,906
The kind of person
people look up to.

718
01:22:53,006 --> 01:22:55,209
Baby is like that.
If you could just see--

719
01:22:55,242 --> 01:22:58,212
Don't you tell me what to see.

720
01:22:58,245 --> 01:23:00,881
I see someone in front of me
who got his partner in trouble...

721
01:23:00,914 --> 01:23:03,350
and sent her off
to some butcher...

722
01:23:03,417 --> 01:23:06,687
while he moved on to an innocent,
young girl like my daughter.

723
01:23:11,859 --> 01:23:14,461
Yeah, I guess that's
what you would see.

724
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:33,280
I can't imagine being here
without you even one day.

725
01:23:33,313 --> 01:23:37,084
Just think, you have more time
for horseshoes and croquet.

726
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:42,756
Maybe they'll saw you
in seven pieces now.

727
01:23:45,158 --> 01:23:47,261
I guess we surprised everybody.

728
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:51,565
I guess we did.

729
01:23:59,573 --> 01:24:01,475
Hardly would be sorry.

730
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:04,978
Neither will l.

731
01:24:12,352 --> 01:24:13,787
I'll see ya.

732
01:25:09,977 --> 01:25:11,945
I'll do your hair.

733
01:25:14,047 --> 01:25:16,149
It could look pretty if--

734
01:25:22,055 --> 01:25:24,491
You're prettier your way.

735
01:25:24,558 --> 01:25:25,826
This way.

736
01:25:48,515 --> 01:25:52,786
Kellermans, we come together

737
01:25:52,886 --> 01:25:56,890
Singing all as one

738
01:25:56,990 --> 01:26:01,094
We have shared another season's

739
01:26:01,161 --> 01:26:05,098
Talent, play and fun

740
01:26:05,165 --> 01:26:09,269
Summer days will soon be over

741
01:26:09,369 --> 01:26:13,473
Soon the autumn starts

742
01:26:13,574 --> 01:26:17,477
And tonight the memories whisper

743
01:26:17,578 --> 01:26:20,948
Softly in our hearts

744
01:26:22,015 --> 01:26:25,886
Join hands and hearts and voices

745
01:26:25,953 --> 01:26:29,356
Voices, hearts and hands

746
01:26:29,423 --> 01:26:33,360
At Kellerman's
the friendships last

747
01:26:33,427 --> 01:26:37,965
Long as the mountain stands

748
01:26:38,031 --> 01:26:42,302
Daytime, nighttime, any hour

749
01:26:42,369 --> 01:26:46,240
Weather rain or shine

750
01:26:46,306 --> 01:26:50,511
Games and lectures
Jokes and music

751
01:26:50,577 --> 01:26:54,648
Happily combine

752
01:27:08,061 --> 01:27:09,963
Good luck in medical school, son.

753
01:27:12,165 --> 01:27:14,701
And I wanted to thank you for your
help with the Penny situation.

754
01:27:14,768 --> 01:27:18,605
- I guess we've all gotten into messes.
- What?

755
01:27:20,307 --> 01:27:23,110
I thought Baby told you.
Look, I'm not sure.

756
01:27:23,177 --> 01:27:26,413
Penny said so, but you know with girls
like that. They're liable to pin it...

757
01:27:26,446 --> 01:27:28,415
on any guy around.

758
01:27:34,655 --> 01:27:37,257
- What's the hot tip for the day?
- Finished.

759
01:27:38,325 --> 01:27:41,195
You and me, Tito.
We've seen it all, eh?

760
01:27:41,295 --> 01:27:46,366
Bubbah and Zeda serving the first
pasteurized milk to the boarders.

761
01:27:46,466 --> 01:27:48,635
Through the war years
when we didn't have any meat.

762
01:27:48,702 --> 01:27:51,438
Through the Depression
when we didn't have anything.

763
01:27:51,471 --> 01:27:53,974
Lots of changes, though, Max.

764
01:27:54,007 --> 01:27:57,511
It's not the changes
so much this time.

765
01:27:57,578 --> 01:28:00,147
It's that it all seems
to be ending.

766
01:28:00,214 --> 01:28:04,218
You think kids want to come with their
parents and take fox-trot lessons?

767
01:28:04,318 --> 01:28:07,454
Trips to Europe,
that's what the kids want.

768
01:28:08,522 --> 01:28:11,091
Twenty-two countries
in three days.

769
01:28:12,192 --> 01:28:14,461
It feels like
it's all slipping away.

770
01:28:15,662 --> 01:28:19,533
But the heartbeats of vacation

771
01:28:19,633 --> 01:28:23,504
There no cares are seen

772
01:28:23,570 --> 01:28:27,541
So let's join in
just one last chorus

773
01:28:27,641 --> 01:28:31,011
Visitors, staff and guests

774
01:28:31,044 --> 01:28:35,582
What we've shared
won't be forgotten

775
01:28:35,682 --> 01:28:38,719
Old friends are the best

776
01:29:14,254 --> 01:29:15,989
Nobody puts Baby in the corner.

777
01:29:17,758 --> 01:29:19,159
Come on.

778
01:29:39,913 --> 01:29:42,115
Sorry about
the disruption, folks...

779
01:29:42,182 --> 01:29:45,452
but I always do
the last dance of the season.

780
01:29:45,552 --> 01:29:48,555
This year somebody told me not to.

781
01:29:48,589 --> 01:29:52,426
So I'm gonna do my kind of dancin'
with a great partner...

782
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:56,163
who's not only
a terrific dancer...

783
01:29:56,263 --> 01:29:58,732
but somebody who's taught me
that there are people...

784
01:29:58,765 --> 01:30:01,802
willing to stand up for other people
no matter what it costs them.

785
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:05,739
Somebody who's taught me...

786
01:30:07,674 --> 01:30:09,776
about the kind of person
I want to be.

787
01:30:10,978 --> 01:30:12,446
Miss Frances Houseman.

788
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:14,681
Sit down, Jake.

789
01:31:38,532 --> 01:31:40,601
I think she gets this from me.

790
01:34:35,209 --> 01:34:38,011
Do you have sheet music
on this stuff?

791
01:34:46,086 --> 01:34:49,189
I know you weren't the one
who got Penny in trouble.

792
01:34:51,358 --> 01:34:53,827
When I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong.

793
01:35:00,367 --> 01:35:02,302
You looked wonderful out there.

794
01:35:59,993 --> 01:36:02,095
Now l

795
01:36:02,162 --> 01:36:06,133
Had the time of my life

796
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:10,370
No, I never felt
this way before

797
01:36:10,437 --> 01:36:12,840
Yes, I swear

798
01:36:12,906 --> 01:36:17,444
It's so true
And I owe it all to you
