Zentropa Entertainments 14

00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,000
A film by
Susanne Bier

3
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,733
<i>I will always love you.</i>

4
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,880
<i>That is the only truth
that remains.</i>

5
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,501
<i>Life is neither right nor wrong,
good or bad.</i>

6
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,191
<i>But I love you.</i>

7
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,149
<i>That's all I know.</i>

8
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,027
BROTHERS

9
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,757
We leave in 14 hours.

10
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,431
This is the last thing
I'll be saying to you on Danish soil.

11
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,203
I know that some of you
are going for the first time.

12
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,987
You won't encounter anything
you haven't been trained for.

13
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,465
If any of you doubt that we're doing
the right thing, wait til we get there.

14
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,535
Then you'll know we're doing
the right thing. Okay?

15
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,602
See you tonight.

16
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,122
Hi there.

17
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,330
Don't do that.
Stop it.

18
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,844
You are such a pain, man!

19
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,755
New wheels.

20
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,561
Looks pretty nice.

21
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,748
- Can I drive?
- No.

22
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,092
- Can I smoke in the car?
- Smoke... Smoke away, man.

23
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,115
Smoke, smoke.

24
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,756
- So there's dinner tonight?
- Mum and dad are coming at five.

25
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,303
She hesitated between roast duck
for you and meat loaf for me.

26
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,766
Go figure. Where did she get
the idea that duck is my favourite?

27
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,353
Or that meat loaf is mine?
I hate it.

28
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,665
- So we agreed on duck for you.
- Why doesn't she just make spaghetti?

29
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,433
There's something I think you should
consider when you have the time.

30
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,162
What?

31
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,753
- What the hell is this?
- It's the woman you assaulted.

32
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,315
- I know. Why do I need her card?
- She's back at her branch now.

33
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,471
I don't give a shit.
Where the hell did you get her card?

34
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,938
I spoke with her a couple of times.
I apologized on your behalf.

35
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,810
Who the fuck do you think you are?
It's none of your business.

36
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,878
She couldn't work for six months.
You've completely ruined her life.

37
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,176
Jannik, stay here. Jannik!

38
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,544
Jannik, what the hell
are you doing? Jannik!

39
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,852
- You can't park there.
- Sorry! My mistake.

40
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,703
Jannik!

41
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,442
Sorry.

42
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,967
Idiot.

43
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,296
- Is dad here?
- Yes.

44
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,175
- They're really beautiful.
- Wanker.

45
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,502
Hello, mum.

46
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,463
- You're so thin.
- I've put on weight.

47
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,534
Nonsense. It's a good thing
I've roasted two huge ducks.

48
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,201
- Oh... We're having roast duck?
- Of course. It's your favourite.

49
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,363
- Are we ready here?
- Will you get the duck?

50
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,962
- Hi.
- Hi.

51
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,841
- Thanks.
- They're from the service station.

52
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,086
- Hi, dad.
- Hi.

53
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,571
"How can you care for someone
so ugly and stupid?"

54
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,353
- Do I have to have potatoes?
- Take two. Give her two, dad.

55
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,572
Here you go.
Two small ones.

56
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,243
I want to get a picture of this.
It's so seldom we're all together.

57
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,037
Smile for your Gran.
You too, Jannik.

58
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,714
- What time are you leaving?
- At twelve.

59
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,982
We wanted to take
you out to lunch.

60
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,026
- We would have more time together.
- We're here now, aren't we?

61
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,318
Your mum still finds it strange that
she never sees her two sons together.

62
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,290
- It's not my fault Michael's leaving.
- Leaving? He's going to work.

63
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,676
There's a difference between
rebuilding a country and jail.

64
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,246
What are you talking about?
They shoot at anything that moves.

65
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,185
- A group of women again, right?
- They all look alike.

66
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,134
<i>- It's those dresses they wear.
- Burkhas.</i>

67
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,762
Alright, alright.
More...?

68
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,872
That's why Sarah wears jeans.
Michael shoots anything in a dress.

69
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,450
- They only shoot the bad guys.
- Do you know the difference, Natalia?

70
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,518
They only shoot the bad
guys, right, Jannik? Relax.

71
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,813
- That kitchen still bothers me.
- We'll survive.

72
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,353
I wanted to finish it before I left.
It's a mess.

73
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,343
You can't cook
properly in that kitchen.

74
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,448
- We'll just order pizza.
- Live on pizza for three months?!

75
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,242
Of course we can.

76
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,001
Shut up about that kitchen!

77
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,148
Cheers.
Have a good trip, son.

78
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,969
- Oh, right, have a good trip.
- Cheers, darling.

79
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,462
It's a good one.
Really good.

80
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,001
- Oh, there they are.
- I really hate that you're leaving.

81
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,474
You'll have the house to yourself.
You can make all the mess you like.

82
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,004
Can't you just stay home?

83
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,211
I love you.

84
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,655
Dad's leaving now.

85
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,242
Don't.

86
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,042
Is it cold or hot in Afghanistan?

87
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,461
- It's a little bit cold.
- Last time it was hot.

88
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,329
Warm here means it's warm there.
Cold here means it's cold there.

89
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,503
Won't you be home for my birthday?

90
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,937
That's not until February.
Give me a kiss.

91
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,949
- Don't!
- Natalia...!

92
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,250
Just leave.
I don't care.

93
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,950
- Give me a hug.
- No.

94
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,142
- A kiss on the cheek?
- I want to watch the film.

95
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,001
- Two kisses on the cheek?
- Just go.

96
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,120
- Three kisses? A hundred?
- Stop it.

97
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,235
That's two against one!

98
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,601
Not there. That's not fair.

99
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,842
What's going on?

100
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,480
Kanstrup and his men were
fired upon while scouting.

101
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,958
Their radar operator was left behind.

102
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,402
Niels Peter Johansen.

103
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,456
He can barely wipe his own ass
without help.

104
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,652
Settle in first. I'll send you out
tonight to look for him.

105
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,322
It's good to see you.

106
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,437
- Hi, Sarah.
- Hi there. Hello?

107
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,349
- Hi. I've arrived.
- Did you call before?

108
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,798
No connection.
I'll make it fast.

109
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,944
Just say that you love me.
That you miss me.

110
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,772
With all the new nurses here?
Are you crazy?

111
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,333
Give the children
a hug from me. Hello

112
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,442
Sarah, are you there?

113
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,364
I just mean that it's
pretty shitty, isn't it?

114
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,641
- Copy, Féborg. Change the record.
- There must be some hookers here.

115
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,381
I can't NOT fuck for 6 months
just because they're Muslims.

116
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,079
Stop that redneck crap, or hookers
will be the least of your problems.

117
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,644
Féborg is actually a big town.

118
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,942
- I decide that. Understood?
- All I'm saying is

119
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,951
- Hi. ls your mother home?
- She's in the bath.

120
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,631
- Mum!
- May we come in?

121
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,391
- Some people want to talk to you.
- Coming.

122
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,678
Come on, girls.
Go watch the film.

123
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,802
Okay, relax.

124
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,305
Sorry, sorry.
I know, I know.

125
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,720
I completely forgot.
I had a flat

126
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,198
or I thought I had a flat.

127
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,628
Are you drunk? Are you driving
around drunk in our car?

128
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,421
Relax.
It's not that serious, is it?

129
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,037
Why are you still up?

130
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,793
Did you talk to Henning and Else?

131
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,968
No, not since I left school,
but that was a really good chat.

132
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,923
Hold on.
Michael lent me the car.

133
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,501
You don't need to stand there
looking so pissed off.

134
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,493
Or look like
You know what I mean.

135
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,478
- I have a taxi coming in a minute
- Michael is dead.

136
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,757
- What?
- They crashed.

137
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,641
What ...?

138
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,122
What are you ...?

139
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,693
What are you telling me?

140
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,766
He's dead, Jannik.

141
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,589
Won't you come in?

142
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,243
No, I don't want to come in.

143
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,263
Sorry, but

144
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,786
What is this...?

145
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,478
I come here to drop off

146
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,021
Why the hell didn't you call me?

147
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,090
We've been trying
to reach you all day.

148
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,642
I'm going home to my mum.

149
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,693
Jannik.

150
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,618
- What are you doing?
- I'm organizing these records.

151
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,377
I found the Beatles record
in the Mozart piano concerto cover.

152
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,754
No wonder I can't find anything.

153
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,237
Michael is dead.

154
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,922
Yes.

155
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,001
Natalia, are you ready?

156
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,211
Natalia, are you ready?

157
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,332
- Where's your dress?
- It's ugly.

158
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,668
Put it on, Natalia.
We have to go.

159
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,305
I don't want to.

160
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,025
Then I don't want to wear
mine either. It's itchy.

161
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,974
Come here.

162
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,579
Is dad really dead
like your mum and dad?

163
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,091
Yes.

164
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,865
I don't want to wear
this crappy dress.

165
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,990
Sarah.

166
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,440
I just want you to know
that if there's anything I can do...

167
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,241
I knew it could happen.
I've known that all along.

168
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,588
We've even talked about it
many times -

169
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,862
- but I don't believe
that he's dead.

170
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,940
I can't feel it.
Don't you think I'd sense it somehow?

171
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,332
Come on, girls. Come on.

172
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,650
- Dad, shouldn't I drive?
- Get in, girls.

173
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,181
- Why should you?
- You've been drinking.

174
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,094
Who do you think you are, brat?!
Come on, girls.

175
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,975
- Let me.
- When did you become so responsible?

176
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,360
Let Jannik drive.

177
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,441
When you manage to get a job,
then you'll have money to buy a car.

178
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,106
Then you can drive all you like.
Until then, I drive.

179
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:11,390
Could you try not to be so such
a fucking asshole just for today?

180
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,007
That in there

181
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,922
that was my boy.
He is gone now.

182
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,586
lam left with nothing.
Do you understand that?

183
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,333
Do you?

184
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,242
Jannik...

185
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,208
- Are you a complete idiot?
- He's just acting out as always.

186
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,776
- Let's go.
- Give me the keys, and I'll drive.

187
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,288
Give me the keys!

188
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,535
I don't know what the hell's
got into everybody.

189
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,655
Right, move over
and make room for Grandad.

190
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,491
Niels Peter?

191
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,725
lam Michael Lundberg,
and I'm a major.

192
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,659
Are you okay? Are you well?

193
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,114
Did they mistreat you?

194
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,653
- Hello.
- Hi, it's Jannik.

195
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,431
<i>Hi I'm sorry to call you
at two in the morning.</i>

196
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,282
<i>It's four o'clock.</i>

197
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,802
<i>Okay.</i>

198
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,310
<i>I'm in this bar with no money.</i>

199
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,321
<i>I happened to buy
some beers and</i>

200
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,770
Sweetie...
I have to go somewhere.

201
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:38,096
You're just insecure because
your nose is the size of Funen.

202
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,858
Hey, Sarah! Say hello to The Nose.
The Nose has closed the bar.

203
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,378
- How much does he owe you?
- 435. And two broken glasses.

204
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,487
- Keep the change.
- Get him out, or I'll call the police.

205
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,726
Relax! You're just grumpy
because you have a big nose.

206
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,916
- That's enough of that.
- Are you going to sneeze now?

207
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,396
Let's cover the bar with a tarp.
Sneeze coming on! It could get ugly.

208
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,613
If you show your face here again,
you'll get your ass kicked.

209
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,266
- Let me touch it.
- Piss off!

210
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,310
You're such an idiot.

211
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,789
Didn't he have a huge nose?
Wasn't it big?

212
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,735
You have to admit that.
It was huge.

213
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,820
When we were kids, Michael
always beat up the ones I pissed off.

214
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,728
Did you call because of the bar tab,
or because you missed Michael?

215
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,919
I never fucking
missed anyone before.

216
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,530
I really miss him.
I really do.

217
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,924
So much
that my stomach hurts.

218
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,201
What a pile of shit.

219
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,693
Sony

220
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,922
The light is green.

221
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,313
Oh no, I dropped it.
I'll make another one...

222
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,061
- Try again.
- You have to do it like this.

223
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,121
We'll throw it to mum.

224
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,513
Oops! It almost went
into the bedroom.

225
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,948
- Hi. Why are you sleeping here?
- It's hard to catch them.

226
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,701
We're making pancakes for mum
so she won't be so sad.

227
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,786
- It's because our dad is dead.
- He knows. He's his brother.

228
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,781
- It hit the ceiling.
- Just spread the jam on the ceiling.

229
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,364
No drinking from the carton!

230
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,389
- Shut up and make your pancakes.
- Want one?

231
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,554
- I don't like pancakes.
- You don't know that.

232
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,061
- Eat your own crap.
- Good-morning.

233
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,484
- Up already?
- We're making pancakes.

234
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,374
One of the pancakes landed
on the shelf up there.

235
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,162
Grandpa's here!

236
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,419
Grandad!

237
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,417
There's pancakes, Grandad!

238
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,404
- Hi, Henning.
- Good-morning, Sarah.

239
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,089
Come on, girls.
Grandpa's waiting.

240
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,715
- Hi.
- Hi.

241
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,944
- Are you having pancakes?
- No. You want one?

242
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,342
No thanks. Listen

243
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,303
I was a little stupid the other day,
but I was okay to drive.

244
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,742
We were both a bit

245
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:08,207
Okay. It was good to talk things
through properly, anyway.

246
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,816
Is there any coffee?

247
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,362
Dad

248
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,592
I know Michael was always better
at the things men should be good at.

249
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,694
- Football and things like that.
- Yes, he was good at that.

250
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,826
It's because you always give up.
Michael never gave up.

251
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,911
No, I know that.
I've always looked up to Michael -

252
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,775
- but he's gone and it isn't my fault.
I'm really sorry about it.

253
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,081
Yes, but that's the way it is.
Isn't there any coffee?

254
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,031
- Jesus, dad
- Don't you start like your mother!

255
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:52,066
You can't change the past. You can't
whine about something that's over.

256
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,514
I just want peace and quiet!
Understand?

257
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,487
I don't want to listen
to any more bullshit!

258
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,241
If you want to do
something worthwhile -

259
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,647
- then start by fixing up this
goddamned kitchen. It looks awful!

260
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,650
- Kitchen time!
- Boring colours!

261
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,806
Check that one out.

262
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,950
- That's a big one, Preben.
- You don't see that around often.

263
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,763
I bet the owner
did a spot of DIY.

264
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,883
Hi.

265
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,327
This is Preben One...
Preben Two.

266
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,962
This is Slobodan.

267
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,539
- I'm changing to Preben.
- Coffee?

268
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,640
- No thanks. Maybe a beer.
- Let's start with some beers.

269
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,252
Take your jackets off, girls.

270
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,270
- Can I help?
- What?

271
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,167
- Can I help?
- Why don't you just watch TV?

272
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,987
- Please!
- Alright. You can paint up here.

273
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,870
Get up there.

274
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,681
Shit!
What the hell are you doing?!

275
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,316
- Sorry.
- You ruined my trousers.

276
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,031
You little bandit.

277
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,609
- What happened?
- I dropped the paint.

278
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,716
- Where's the toilet?
- Stay there a second, please.

279
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,012
What are you laughing at?
You've ruined my clothes.

280
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,093
- You hardly notice it. I can't see it.
- Of course you do.

281
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,233
- What the hell are you staring at?
- You have a lovely body, Preben.

282
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,962
Shut your mouth.

283
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,362
Do you work out?

284
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,029
Your socks are pretty cool, too.

285
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,785
- You're so fucking funny.
- Here you go. I think they'll fit you.

286
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,040
A t-shirt and trousers are fine.

287
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,050
Take it all.

288
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,101
- I don't need all that.
- There's more.

289
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,254
You don't have to do that.
She doesn't have to give me all that.

290
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,564
Why don't you take it all?
Please take it.

291
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,449
- I don't have to bring it back?
- No, just take it.

292
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,853
- Why don't we call it a day?
- Yes, of course.

293
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,533
You know the bank, right ...?

294
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,754
You know about the robbery?

295
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,526
Michael wanted me to go
and see the lady and apologize.

296
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,044
Of course he did.

297
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,542
Well, the day after that
memorial service for him -

298
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,932
- I went down there
and said I was sorry.

299
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,974
At first she was scared
and they wanted to throw me out.

300
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,331
Then they let me talk to her.

301
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,640
- What did she say?
- She didn't say much.

302
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:35,491
She'd had counseling and hadn't
slept properly in three years.

303
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,476
She dreamt that I would
come back and shoot her.

304
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:48,328
When I said that she shouldn't
be afraid of me anymore -

305
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,499
- and that I wouldn't harm her,
she started to cry.

306
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,988
She was so happy
that she hugged me.

307
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,503
I opened an account with her.
It's true.

308
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,481
I know he's gone.

309
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,476
I know he's never coming back.

310
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,354
Happy birthday to mum

311
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,582
- Thank you.
- Now blow out the candles.

312
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,253
- I couldn't.
- Four boyfriends!

313
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,746
It's very impressive.
Did you make it yourselves?

314
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,960
- Gran helped us.
- No, I didn't.

315
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,020
- Don't lie to them, Else.
- Will you be working full time?

316
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,600
- Oh, yes! Jannik's got a job.
- A job?

317
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,659
I'm helping Preben Two
fix things...

318
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,375
You got a job?
That won't last long.

319
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,965
Preben Two? ls that
a company name? Preben Two?

320
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:48,232
- Whispers tell lies...
- Don't you want some cake first?

321
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,676
- Mum, come on.
- We broke something.

322
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,631
I was playing with it,
and then I stepped on it.

323
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,892
- Well, well
- I'll eat that ugly cake, then.

324
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:06,794
Gran will make sure he doesn't
touch it before you're back.

325
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,243
- Happy birthday!
- A bicycle!

326
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,309
It was the girls' idea.

327
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,895
- Isn't it nice?
- It's lovely.

328
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,393
It has a giraffe on it
that Camilla chose.

329
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,590
- Aren't you lovely, girls!
- Can we have cake now?

330
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,266
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

331
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,162
- Hi.
- Hi.

332
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,098
I just wanted to put the last
of the fillets on.

333
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,762
<i>Okay.</i>

334
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,453
- Where are the girls?
- They're sleeping.

335
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,765
You know what... I'm sorry...
I shouldn't have kissed you.

336
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,541
- No, it was me
- It was stupid.

337
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,407
Don't worry

338
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,201
Alright then

339
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,373
I'll just put these in place.

340
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,616
We just miss Michael so much.

341
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:41,065
The others miss him too.
Of course they miss him, but...

342
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,577
Right

343
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:53,106
I always thought you were
a stupid bastard.

344
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,748
And I thought you were
a boring, middle-class bitch.

345
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:08,938
I don't want to ruin anything.
I just want to keep coming here.

346
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,826
You can come here all you want.
Hell, you can have a key.

347
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,412
I'd rather have one for the car, then.

348
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,191
- What's going on?
- Quiet.

349
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,162
Show us how to arm this.

350
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:42,146
- I said show us how to arm this.
- I don't know anything about this.

351
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,597
Are you sure you don't know how?

352
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,720
I know how to do this.
I can show you.

353
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,124
Let him go
and I'll show you.

354
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,722
Let him go
and I'll show you.

355
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,741
Show us again,
slowly this time.

356
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,783
Let him go.

357
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,470
And give him water.
He needs water.

358
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,962
We both do.

359
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,695
And perhaps he would like some
Coca-Cola and air-conditioning too?

360
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,346
He needs water.
We both need water.

361
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,590
Take the battery

362
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,970
Take off protection cap
open the sight-

363
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,597
- release the safety catch.

364
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,936
Release the gyro.
You hear a high-pitched tone -

365
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,433
- and when it get's constant,
you elevate -

366
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,748
- and you pull the trigger.

367
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:41,444
- Will they come and get us?
- They'll come and get us.

368
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,158
Why don't they come, then?

369
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,002
Stop crying-

370
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,200
All you do is lose body fluid.
Alright?

371
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,762
They're going to kill us.

372
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,618
If they wanted to kill us,
they would have done it by now.

373
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,386
Why are they keeping us here?

374
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,735
I keep thinking about Ditte.

375
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,822
And little Gustav.

376
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,017
I just want to

377
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,143
I just want to hold him again soon.

378
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:39,588
- I don't want to die.
- You won't.

379
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,841
- Why don't they find us, then?
- They will.

380
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,996
- You have to keep a level head.
- I'm not like you guys.

381
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,474
I haven't trained for any of this.
I'm just a radar technician.

382
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,766
I can't do all this stuff.

383
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,078
We'll get out of here.
I promise you.

384
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,621
You don't think we're going to die?

385
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,099
Yes, I do.

386
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,733
But not here.

387
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,564
Look at me.

388
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:26,431
We'll make it.
We'll make it alright.

389
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,219
We'll make it.

390
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,522
We'll make it.

391
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,403
To live, you must be of use.
He's of no use.

392
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,111
Kill him.

393
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,628
You're a brave man.
Kill him.

394
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,762
- Kill him or you both die.
- Michael...!

395
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,822
Do you want to live?

396
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,997
Yes.
I want to live.

397
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,367
Do it!

398
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,376
Do it now!

399
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,749
Do it now!

400
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,351
Do it!

401
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,042
Come on!

402
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,042
Now!

403
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,762
Do it!

404
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,646
Again!
Do it now!

405
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,402
Do it!

406
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,442
Again!

407
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,482
Again!

408
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,129
Don't move!
Get down!

409
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,682
Get down!

410
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,491
Hello.

411
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,782
Can you hear me?

412
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,579
Can you hear me?

413
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,824
Captain David Ward,
British Army.

414
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,695
- What's your name?
- Michael Lundberg.

415
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,654
- And where are you from?
- Denmark.

416
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:50,972
- What's your rank?
- Major.

417
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:56,288
- I want to speak to my wife.
- Yes. Yes, of course.

418
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,930
How were you treated
in the camp?

419
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:04,002
- Well... I'm alive.
- Yes, sir. You were lucky.

420
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,761
Did you have any contact
with the other captives?

421
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,972
- What do you mean?
- You must have seen them.

422
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:24,441
I'm sorry we have to do this but I have
some photos of men missing in action -

423
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,164
- I'd like you to look at.

424
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,481
These photo also contain
non-British nationals.

425
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:40,449
We just need to know
if you've seen any of these men.

426
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,280
No. I'm sorry.

427
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,263
You're certain you've never
seen these faces?

428
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,053
No. I'm sorry.

429
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:08,825
Well, thank you, sir.
Now get some rest.

430
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,972
- You've earned it.
- Thank you.

431
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,873
Michael!
Jesus, it's good to see you!

432
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,442
Likewise.

433
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,655
I want to talk to my wife.
Why can't I talk to her?

434
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,948
Has something happened to her?

435
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,810
We thought you were all dead.
You've been declared dead.

436
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,842
Have I?

437
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,737
All we knew was that you crashed.

438
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,308
What does my epitaph say?

439
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,377
I hope Jannik didn't write it.

440
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:05,639
- Up you go. Are you drunk?
- No, you're drunk!

441
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:09,773
You look plastered to me.
How much did you drink?

442
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,784
Sarah speaking. Yes?

443
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,659
- I want it!
- Don't do that.

444
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,589
- I want to throw it
- Throw it! Go on!

445
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:27,967
- Natalia, what happened?
- What did you do to my sister?

446
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,602
You're too easy!

447
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,802
What's wrong?

448
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,721
Hi, dad.

449
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,804
- Don't cry now.
- I'm not crying.

450
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,386
- Who will get there first?
- I will.

451
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:51,750
You have to see the kitchen, dad.
Come on, quickly.

452
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,183
- Look what we made for you.
- Jesus Who did this?

453
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,235
Jannik and the three little pigs.

454
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,554
- Did Jannik do this?
- Yes, and some carpenters.

455
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,844
- Are you hungry?
- No, thanks.

456
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,875
What are you doing?

457
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,282
What's he doing?

458
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,269
What's going on?

459
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:48,461
Can't we just lie here on the bed
for a while? All of us.

460
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,042
Come on.

461
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:22,660
- How long do we have to lie here?
- Just a little while longer.

462
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,753
Can I go watch TV?

463
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:49,188
- Just stay a little longer.
- Okay.

464
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:59,459
Is dad dead again already?

465
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,801
- He's just sleeping.
- You can't die more than once.

466
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:08,451
- Yes, you can.
- No, you bloody well can't.

467
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,428
- Hi, Michael.
- Can I talk to you in private?

468
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,850
Of course.
We'll go down to the office.

469
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:35,181
- Are you managing alright?
- Sure.

470
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,465
I wasn't alone at the camp.
I saw Niels Peter.

471
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,810
We were in the same camp.

472
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,495
I didn't think you had
any contact with others.

473
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,367
But it's good
you remembered it.

474
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,282
Yes.

475
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,274
He were in the same camp.

476
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,842
I---

477
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:25,277
It can be difficult to remember
what happened.

478
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,541
- What?
- Sit down, Michael.

479
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:49,522
Michael, when we find out what took
place, I'll pass on the information.

480
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:56,113
Just take it easy.
Give yourself some time...

481
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,558
Then your memory
will come back to you.

482
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,892
I'm better than I thought.

483
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,572
Thank you for taking care of Sarah
and the girls. I didn't expect that.

484
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:59,824
- But of course.
- I mean it. I'm proud of you.

485
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:04,804
Yes, of course.
It suddenly made sense, right?

486
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,816
I want to ask you something.
I know it sounds far out.

487
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,694
I don't mind if you have.
Did you sleep with her?

488
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,573
- What?
- With Sarah.

489
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,942
I can forgive you.
I just want to know.

490
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:39,054
- I mean, you thought I was dead.
- But we didn't.

491
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,653
What the ...?
Of course we haven't. Michael

492
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:48,370
- I can forgive you.
- We haven't.

493
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:52,641
- What makes you think that?
- You look like teenagers in love.

494
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:56,972
Come on! You used to be pissed off
because I couldn't stand her.

495
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:02,635
Now that I've found out how nice
and lovely she is, is that wrong, too?

496
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,393
- No, no.
- Then don't say things like that.

497
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:12,416
She's way too old for me anyway.

498
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,722
Shall we ...?

499
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:33,601
Tobias is stupid, but Arnold is nice.
He never hits people.

500
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:38,177
- He never hits people?
- No, just the small boys. Not girls.

501
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,327
He's the best at maths,
and he's got a dog with big ears.

502
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,191
- I can't remember its name.
- Elephant?

503
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,645
It's not a dog, is it?
An elephant is not a dog.

504
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:03,681
- It was only a joke.
- But it's not funny. ls it?

505
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:07,233
Sitting there talking nonsense!

506
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,602
Michael, relax.

507
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:20,453
It's alright.
Don't be afraid.

508
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,082
And don't be sad.

509
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:31,636
The girls have taken a fancy
to Jannik, haven't they?

510
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:36,001
- He said he's slept here.
- Yes, a few times.

511
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:39,706
- Did he sleep in here?
- Of course he didn't.

512
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:47,266
You could have fallen
for each other.

513
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,730
- You thought I was dead.
- No, we couldn't have.

514
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:55,731
- You look so cute together.
- Stop it.

515
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:06,746
- Did you sleep with him?
- Michael, stop it.

516
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:14,910
- You slept with him.
- Michael, nothing happened.

517
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,590
We kissed.

518
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,077
We were just confused.

519
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:25,330
- What else?
- That's it.

520
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,452
Let go.

521
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:41,215
Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go

522
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:52,821
What the hell is wrong with you?!
What the hell are you doing?!

523
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:06,758
You're crazy!
All of you! Crazy!

524
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:13,075
Don't be afraid of me.

525
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,985
Your hair looks nice.

526
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,909
Did mum do this?

527
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:29,182
- Natalia did.
- Did you?

528
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,722
Yes.

529
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,200
Don't be afraid of me.

530
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:38,121
Alright?

531
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:42,756
I'm sorry that I shouted
and did all those silly things.

532
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,922
But I love you.

533
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,202
Very much.

534
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:52,051
Both of you.

535
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:59,883
Don't be sad. Don't cry.

536
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,482
I want you to be happy.

537
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:06,301
I want us all to be happy.

538
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:16,123
Promise me
that you'll both be happy.

539
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:24,890
Do you know this one? What is white
in the air and yellow on the ground?

540
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,242
An egg.

541
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:31,553
- Have I told you that one?
- A hundred times.

542
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,760
Is that right?
A hundred times?

543
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:12,097
- Shall I push you?
- Yes, please.

544
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:33,451
Michael
We have to talk about this.

545
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,766
Can't you tell me what happened?

546
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:45,118
- Nothing happened.
- Oh, come on.

547
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:53,149
Can't you tell me just a little bit?

548
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,804
- Tell me just a little bit.
- There is nothing to tell.

549
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:02,694
I sat in a dark room, thinking.

550
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,322
I thought about you all-

551
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:09,236
- and the time we broke up.

552
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,640
I drove over to your flat
to apologise -

553
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,936
- but you wouldn't let me in.

554
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,602
Come in!

555
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:25,513
- Ditte.
- Michael.

556
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:29,562
I'm glad you people call all the time,
even if there is no news.

557
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:34,171
As long as we don't hear anything,
there's still hope.

558
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,826
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yes, please.

559
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,259
Thank you.

560
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:12,388
I saw Niels Peter down there.
He was down there.

561
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:18,267
- Did you see him?
- We were in the same camp.

562
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,721
Why didn't he
come home with you?

563
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:29,438
He was moved to another camp.

564
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,295
That means he's still alive!

565
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,819
Yes

566
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:45,242
When he

567
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:49,093
He was moved to another camp,
but he was fine when I saw him.

568
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,041
He'll make it.

569
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:57,819
Would you like some cake?

570
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,684
We were together for a long time
and he told me about Gustav

571
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:27,423
and about you, of course.
He told me all sons of things.

572
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:30,862
- You're taking your driving test.
- I didn't pass.

573
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:34,597
No, he said you wouldn't

574
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:40,606
- He was very proud of Gustav.
- He really wanted a girl.

575
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:44,841
But when Gustav came along,
he was so pleased.

576
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,522
I'm sorry.

577
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:57,549
- Hi.
- Hello. This is Solvej. Sorry.

578
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:00,361
Solvej, my brother's wife Sarah.

579
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,911
Come on in.

580
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:11,172
- There you go.
- Do I look okay?

581
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:14,354
You look fantastic.
Come on in.

582
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,242
Sorry.

583
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,402
Hi.

584
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:25,992
This is Solvej and this is my dad
and my mum.

585
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:30,139
- This is my brother, Michael.
- Natalia is watching TV.

586
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:35,436
- This is Camilla, the birthday girl.
- Thank you so much.

587
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:39,961
We just met.
It happened so fast.

588
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:43,416
It's very nice to meet you.
Great!

589
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:51,074
- Where's the bathroom?
- Upstairs. I'll show you.

590
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,933
Taking a piss again?

591
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,471
Why don't you open it?

592
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:02,051
Where did you meet her?

593
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:07,036
At the Royal Library.
What do you think? In a bar.

594
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:11,694
- She certainly looks
- She seems quite nice.

595
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,322
Lovely, lovely.

596
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:17,353
Rationally ...! What are you
talking about? It's war.

597
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:21,823
Today people need therapy
when they fall off their bikes.

598
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:26,878
- They're soldiers and trained for it.
- Stop messing with that doll!

599
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:31,361
Maybe they're not trained
to see people get shot.

600
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:36,113
- What do you think they trained for?
- Yes, but...

601
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:42,588
- That doesn't make it nice, does it?
- Now Solvej has a point here.

602
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:47,922
- If it was nice everyone would do it.
- Stop it, Natalia!

603
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:52,372
Stop it, Natalia!
Eat up. You hardly touched it.

604
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:56,943
- I'm not hungry. I want to watch TV.
- Eat your dinner.

605
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,922
Camilla ate her dinner.

606
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:04,556
But then Camilla got the best doll.
I didn't get my bag.

607
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:08,465
- You'll eat your dinner.
- You don't decide shit around here!

608
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:12,414
- Couldn't you just stay dead?
- Natalia!

609
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:18,995
Why are you taking it out on me?

610
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:23,178
You're just pissed off because
mum would rather shag Jannik.

611
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:28,903
- What are you saying?
- You and Jannik shag all the time.

612
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,673
- That's enough!
- Disgusting!

613
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:36,551
Oh, stop it. She has no idea
what she's saying.

614
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:40,573
- Give me your plate.
- It's not true.

615
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:47,251
This is insane.
She's just upset.

616
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:58,093
How long were you
in India, Solvej?

617
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:02,623
- Four months.
- Did you ride elephants?

618
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:07,507
- That is so far out.
- Were you up north? It's beautiful.

619
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:11,050
- No, we didn't have time.
- Little bastard.

620
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,410
Who the hell do you think you are?

621
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:18,089
I forgot I have to meet
some friends, so

622
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:22,822
Sit down, all of you.
It's Camilla's birthday.

623
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:27,497
- Nobody is leaving.
- I don't think we need that tone

624
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:31,363
Oh, be quiet. You don't know
what Natalia has seen.

625
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:35,476
What does that matter?
It's difficult for all of us.

626
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:39,750
The important thing here
is Camilla's birthday.

627
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:44,030
- Yes, that's right!
- And we're celebrating that.

628
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:51,524
Mum ...!

629
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:55,025
_ Mum!
<i>_</i> Shut up!

630
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:57,482
Mum.

631
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,576
- Why aren't you asleep?
- I can't sleep.

632
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:04,602
That was the worst birthday
in my entire life.

633
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:11,583
We'll have a new one.

634
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,481
I promise.

635
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,794
What are you playing at?

636
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:23,764
I'm sorry about what I said.

637
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,989
Why did you say it?

638
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:36,769
I don't like dad. I'd rather have
Jannik around instead of dad.

639
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:40,012
Me too.

640
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,625
Dad will be himself again soon.

641
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,362
Michael.

642
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,649
Get out of my way!

643
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:55,156
- Mum!
- Go up to your room. Now!

644
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:06,784
- Please stop.
- Do you realise what I did?

645
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,613
Do you realise what I did
to be with you?

646
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:13,641
You don't understand anything!
I'm going to fucking kill you!

647
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:17,511
Should I kill you?!
I'm going to fucking kill you!

648
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:27,962
I'm going to kill you!

649
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:33,121
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill all of you!

650
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:41,524
Jannik.
Michael's gone berserk. Hurry!

651
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:50,588
Come on down, girls.
Come on down.

652
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:54,933
The police, please.

653
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:58,882
I'm bloody well going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you all!

654
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,202
Sony

655
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:10,570
Don't cry.

656
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:18,332
I'm going to kill you!

657
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:40,022
Sarah. Sarah

658
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:46,323
- My little brother.
- Jannik.

659
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:52,495
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let's all sit down and talk about it.

660
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:56,293
- Sarah, go to the car.
- Go to your room!

661
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:58,831
- Go to your room!
- Stop it!

662
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:05,743
- Michael!
- Go upstairs again! Sarah!

663
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,762
Take the car keys!

664
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,549
What did you do?

665
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:29,607
You call that a punch?

666
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,625
Michael, Michael

667
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,377
Did you call the cops?!

668
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:49,214
- Did you call the cops?!
- Michael

669
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:52,514
Did you call the cops?!

670
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:57,295
Of course I didn't call the cops!
You idiot!

671
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:06,858
- Nothing happened.
- Stop there. Stop right there.

672
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:10,160
We got into a fight.
Nothing happened.

673
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:13,717
Stay down!

674
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:18,453
- Fuck, man! He took my gun.
- Drop the gun.

675
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:21,082
Drop <i>it.</i>

676
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:25,666
- Drop the gun, Michael.
- Then shoot me.

677
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:29,016
- Drop the gun!
- Come on!

678
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:33,655
- Shoot me, then.
- Shut up!

679
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,721
Come on!
You'll get a promotion.

680
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:40,202
Michael, drop the gun.

681
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:44,533
- Drop the gun.
- Who the hell are you?

682
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:47,583
Who the hell are you?

683
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,269
- Michael, for my sake.
- Shoot me.

684
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,762
Come on!

685
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:56,372
Shoot me!

686
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,761
- Put the gun down.
- Drop it!

687
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:27,551
- On the ground, both of you.
- On the ground.

688
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:31,642
- Get down!
- Michael, get down.

689
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:35,864
- Get down on your belly.
- Lie down on you belly, okay?

690
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:38,807
Michael...
Do it!

691
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:44,719
Arms stretched out!
Handcuff both of them.

692
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:49,581
Don't move.

693
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:29,364
- Hi.
- Hi.

694
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:33,429
Fuck...

695
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:48,013
He'll get off lightly.

696
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:52,667
He's never been in trouble before
and has a bag full of medals.

697
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,540
This is incredible. Oh, I should be
careful not to drop ashes in here.

698
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:13,986
- Let's clean this up.
- Yes.

699
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,813
I'll throw this out.

700
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:16,945
<i>I will always love you.
That is the only truth that remains.</i>

701
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:35,101
<i>Life is neither right nor wrong,
good or bad.</i>

702
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:55,281
<i>But I love you.
That's all I know.</i>

703
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:11,983
PRISON

704
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:26,690
Michael Lundberg, visitor for you.
She's waiting outside.

705
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:56,590
- Hi.
- Hi.

706
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:02,376
Visit number 00412.

707
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:27,893
- Do you want to walk or sit?
- Okay.

708
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:32,099
- Take a walk?
- Yes.

709
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:43,651
- Did you have your hair cut?
- No.

710
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:46,715
I'm wearing mascara.

711
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:50,213
That's right.

712
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:53,741
- You look good.
- Thanks.

713
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:01,922
This is from the girls.

714
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:09,304
- How are they?
- They're fine.

715
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:13,213
And mum and dad?

716
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:15,717
Michael

717
01:44:20,440 --> 01:44:25,116
- I want to know what happened.
- No, you don't.

718
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:29,436
It doesn't concern you or anyone
else. It's my problem, alright?

719
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,197
If you don't tell me,
you'll never see me again.

720
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:53,269
Ever.

721
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,857
I can't.

722
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,931
Yes, you can.

723
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,560
He had a little boy.

724
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:32,033
He had a little boy.

725
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:01,246
