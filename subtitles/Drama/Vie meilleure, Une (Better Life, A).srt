1
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:45,325
<i>New York, February 16, 1959.</i>

2
00:00:52,127 --> 00:00:55,008
Hurry! She collapsed 10 minutes ago.

3
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,821
The ambulance is on its way.

4
00:01:56,951 --> 00:02:00,152
<i>Saint Theresa, dear God,
do not forsake me...</i>

5
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:05,674
<i>give me strength. I want to live.
Restore me to life.</i>

6
00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:13,557
Paris, Belleville, 1918.

7
00:02:28,243 --> 00:02:31,364
Why are you crying?
Get the hell out of here, scum!

8
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:40,887
<i>I'm so lonely and miserable.
Life is so hard.</i>

9
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:45,769
<i>But it's all I know.
What more can I say?</i>

10
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,890
What are you doing here?

11
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,371
Why are you crying?
Are you on your own?

12
00:02:54,972 --> 00:02:56,773
Where's your mother?

13
00:02:57,853 --> 00:03:03,695
<i>Wherever I go, in chains,</i>

14
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:09,577
<i>There is nothing but pain.
Nothing to accomplish.</i>

15
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:16,180
<i>My life is so hard.
I've known nothing else,</i>

16
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,861
<i>I'm all alone and miserable.</i>

17
00:03:20,102 --> 00:03:22,782
A fine mother YOU are!
Hanging's too good for you!

18
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:26,664
I have to live too. I'm a singer!
She should be looking after your daughter!

19
00:03:26,904 --> 00:03:28,664
I look after her very well!

20
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:43,590
<i>Louis, I can no longer wait here for you.
Belleville is horrible.</i>

21
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:47,711
<i>My agent says that someone with my talent
should go to Constantinople...</i>

22
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:50,513
<i>just like Frehel the singer...</i>

23
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:52,994
Good news for our acrobat?

24
00:03:53,473 --> 00:03:57,315
Sure, and Clemenceau sends his regards.

25
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:05,799
<i>I left Edith with my mother.</i>

26
00:04:05,998 --> 00:04:09,200
<i>She'll take care of her
till I'm on my feet again.</i>

27
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,081
<i>Louis, I can't wait for you any longer.</i>

28
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:15,682
<i>Anetta.</i>

29
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,130
Anybody home?

30
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:14,303
Edith?

31
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:23,707
Louis?

32
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,909
I'm taking her with me.

33
00:05:52,037 --> 00:05:56,639
Bernay, Normandy, 1918.

34
00:06:29,051 --> 00:06:30,451
And who's this?

35
00:06:32,452 --> 00:06:35,773
Your granddaughter: Edith.

36
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:40,655
That's a peculiar name.

37
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:50,258
She's a sickly looking child.

38
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:54,580
Come with me.

39
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:06,344
What are you doing here?

40
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:09,666
What a angel! What's your name?

41
00:07:09,865 --> 00:07:14,187
Back to work, Titine!
There's someone in the toilet upstairs.

42
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,868
What lovely blue eyes you have.

43
00:07:31,074 --> 00:07:32,593
I'm listening...

44
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,355
I have to be getting back.

45
00:07:37,876 --> 00:07:42,277
I'll be demobbed soon.
Then I can work as an acrobat again.

46
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:45,879
I'll return for my little angel.
Not now!

47
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,480
I'm finished, Mama Louise.
Watch the door.

48
00:07:55,682 --> 00:07:56,882
Where's her mother?

49
00:07:58,203 --> 00:07:59,804
No idea.

50
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:05,886
Would you want her to stay here?

51
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:12,089
People will talk.
People always talk.

52
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:49,902
Isn't she going with us to Mass?

53
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:57,105
We'll be late for Mass.
The world doesn't revolve around her.

54
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:07,708
It appears we have a baby.
May we see her?

55
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:09,858
It's a little girl. Would
she like some bread?

56
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:11,830
All right, everybody
leave, please.

57
00:09:14,111 --> 00:09:16,512
Come on, ask her if she'll sing for us.

58
00:09:18,313 --> 00:09:21,594
A shame that communists
aren't allowed on the stage.

59
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:30,917
<i>One night I went swimming
in my birthday suit,</i>

60
00:09:31,118 --> 00:09:35,999
<i>Nobody could see me,
Only the night itself.</i>

61
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:41,601
<i>Until the moon suddenly appeared,
I felt like saying: Shine on me.</i>

62
00:09:41,842 --> 00:09:44,443
<i>Then I heard close by.</i>

63
00:09:44,602 --> 00:09:46,522
<i>A heartfelt cry.</i>

64
00:09:46,723 --> 00:09:51,525
<i>A man stood on a rock,
Low enough to see me.</i>

65
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:53,726
<i>The man cried "Oh!"</i>

66
00:09:54,246 --> 00:09:59,208
<i>And from the water,
I cried "oh" back.</i>

67
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:02,729
<i>He saw me naked,</i>

68
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:11,211
<i>Nothing to cover me,
I blushed the whole night long.</i>

69
00:10:11,452 --> 00:10:17,334
<i>He saw me naked,
Completely naked.</i>

70
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:23,336
<i>Out of respect for the poor man,
I covered up my face.</i>

71
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:29,218
<i>But now I know that by doing so.</i>

72
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:35,941
<i>I ended up showing
my charms below.</i>

73
00:10:36,741 --> 00:10:40,623
<i>He saw me naked.</i>

74
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,631
Titine! Open the door.
That's enough now.

75
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:06,552
What's the matter?
She has Edith with her.

76
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:09,473
Open up I say!
Whatever is the matter?

77
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:13,234
Nothing. Get a move on.
The customers will be here any minute.

78
00:11:14,555 --> 00:11:17,556
Open the door! Otherwise I'll...
I don't want to work.

79
00:11:18,756 --> 00:11:21,237
I don't want to work.
Oh, you don't want to work?

80
00:11:21,477 --> 00:11:27,239
What do you think this is, a hotel?
Edith is staying here with me tonight.

81
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,160
That's what YOU think.

82
00:11:29,761 --> 00:11:34,282
It's me. Open this door.
The soldier is here.

83
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:38,964
<i>I couldn't care less.
That liar with his lies and alibis.</i>

84
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:41,954
<i>Stop your nonsense and
get yourself out here.</i>

85
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,767
<i>Otherwise it's the
street for you.</i>

86
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:47,087
I'm tired of you playing the drama queen!

87
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,771
I don't want any nonsense.

88
00:12:15,898 --> 00:12:19,579
New York, May 8, 1959

89
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,100
Doug!

90
00:12:27,982 --> 00:12:29,783
What, are you jealous?

91
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,064
I'll send the Billie Holiday records
to the hotel.

92
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:38,786
<i>Thank you, Loulou. Billie and I were born
the same year. Is that not something?</i>

93
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:43,267
I've brought my drawings.

94
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:47,189
You want to see them now, or later?

95
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:50,710
Later. First I have to
sing that shmuck's song.

96
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:55,192
That's before your time...
What?

97
00:12:55,672 --> 00:12:58,073
Nothing.

98
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:25,123
I'm ready.

99
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:26,883
I'm ready.

100
00:14:45,032 --> 00:14:46,352
That's Jeanne!

101
00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:51,554
What's the matter?

102
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:54,356
Blood everywhere...
Tell me about it!

103
00:14:54,516 --> 00:14:58,237
<i>He wanted to play doctors and patients,
with my instruments.</i>

104
00:14:58,437 --> 00:14:59,958
The filthy swine!

105
00:15:01,838 --> 00:15:03,319
Titine!

106
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:07,240
We'll have to tell Madame.
She'll kill me. It hurts!

107
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:12,243
I can't see anything.

108
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:33,330
Well, doctor?
It's not good I'm afraid.

109
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,451
It's her cornea.

110
00:15:37,651 --> 00:15:38,852
Is she blind?

111
00:15:39,652 --> 00:15:41,573
It's an infection.

112
00:15:42,653 --> 00:15:44,854
Patience. This sort of
thing can last for months.

113
00:15:45,455 --> 00:15:48,456
Take this to the pharmacist.

114
00:15:49,736 --> 00:15:51,057
My thanks.

115
00:15:51,337 --> 00:15:52,657
Whose child is she?

116
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:56,378
Nobody's.

117
00:16:33,351 --> 00:16:37,594
Lisieux, Normandy.

118
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:45,876
<i>Theresa, I never ask anything of you. But
I'm asking you to listen to little Edith.</i>

119
00:16:46,676 --> 00:16:50,879
Please, Edith.
Say it. She's listening.

120
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:56,480
Theresa, I don't want to be blind.
I want to see.

121
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,081
She bumps into everything.
Go on.

122
00:16:59,281 --> 00:17:01,670
<i>I want to learn how to read,
and to run like I used to.</i>

123
00:17:01,683 --> 00:17:04,083
<i>I don't want to be blind.</i>

124
00:17:04,283 --> 00:17:08,165
Saint Theresa, please ask baby Jesus
to take care of Edith.

125
00:17:09,085 --> 00:17:10,565
Go on.

126
00:17:10,886 --> 00:17:15,007
Thank you, Saint Theresa, Jesus.
Thank you.

127
00:19:16,212 --> 00:19:17,732
She can see...

128
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:20,333
She can see!

129
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,057
Titine, get up!

130
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:34,618
What is it?
He's back. He's come for Edith.

131
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:36,339
Get dressed.

132
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,540
They can't do this to me!

133
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,541
How can you keep on doing this?

134
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,541
She'll see a lot of the world.

135
00:19:43,742 --> 00:19:44,621
Go!

136
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:47,943
Edith!

137
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:49,664
Titine!

138
00:19:50,944 --> 00:19:52,945
Don't take my little girl away.

139
00:19:53,145 --> 00:19:55,065
Let her go!

140
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:57,067
Enough!

141
00:19:57,426 --> 00:19:58,867
She's crazy!

142
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:00,348
Stop or I'll throw you out!

143
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:02,628
You've no right!

144
00:20:08,351 --> 00:20:11,832
- Don't do this to me!
- Go!

145
00:20:20,355 --> 00:20:22,235
It's over! I'm ending it all.

146
00:20:27,838 --> 00:20:30,559
Here we are at Orly airport.
The passengers are disembarking...

147
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:35,280
I see Edith Piaf!
With a young man in tow.

148
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,882
What have you brought back from America?
An American.

149
00:20:39,082 --> 00:20:40,762
What's his name?

150
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:43,163
Edith, for God's sake!

151
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:45,964
<i>Just as in her song, she's carried
'by the crowd.'.</i>

152
00:20:46,164 --> 00:20:50,366
She's stepping into her amazing
black-and-white automobile.

153
00:20:51,687 --> 00:20:54,647
She looks exhausted, but
she's dazzling all the same.

154
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,451
Quiet, please! I wish to propose a toast...

155
00:21:03,771 --> 00:21:04,971
You're drunk!

156
00:21:05,772 --> 00:21:07,172
You're one to talk!

157
00:21:08,653 --> 00:21:10,573
Help the invalid.

158
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:15,775
Look out, accordion
player, or I'll get you.

159
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,776
Perfect timing.

160
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:22,258
Get the manager.
I demand champagne on the house.

161
00:21:22,578 --> 00:21:25,579
I'm Edith Piaf,
and I've made a mess of things.

162
00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:31,461
<i>Kiss one another! Even those who don't
like each other! Kiss me, Claude.</i>

163
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,464
.

164
00:21:39,984 --> 00:21:42,265
- Who's that slapper?
- No idea.

165
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:46,786
The spicy beef tartare?
Where's your handsome friend?

166
00:21:46,987 --> 00:21:51,308
Don't embarrass her...
Cool it. Who asked you?

167
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:53,590
Miss?

168
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:57,070
Miss Piaf, what an honour!
What can I do for you?

169
00:21:58,111 --> 00:22:02,112
A lot. I'd like a present.
But of course.

170
00:22:03,473 --> 00:22:06,794
I wanted champagne, but I prefer a ring...

171
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:09,795
a large ring studded with diamonds.

172
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,317
Don't bother. We'll have the champagne.

173
00:22:14,397 --> 00:22:17,198
Here's to the love I feel for all of you...

174
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:21,199
for which I stand. Help me up, someone.

175
00:22:25,081 --> 00:22:28,122
A toast to Marguerite.

176
00:22:30,002 --> 00:22:34,204
My composer and most loyal
friend in the business.

177
00:22:35,405 --> 00:22:39,406
Oh, don't blush so. You're making us weep.

178
00:22:54,811 --> 00:22:58,413
What about a photograph?
I don't think so.

179
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:03,895
Bubbles and alcohol, perfect!
That's Claude's doing.

180
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:09,097
<i>You're such a bore, Loulou. We've just
returned to Paris, and we're having fun.</i>

181
00:23:12,418 --> 00:23:15,019
Stop playing the unhappy lover.

182
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,421
I'm waiting for someone.

183
00:23:21,621 --> 00:23:25,903
Don't forget you've responsibilities.
There's more than you.

184
00:23:26,143 --> 00:23:29,625
<i>Remember the first night in Gerney
's?</i>

185
00:23:30,224 --> 00:23:33,905
I looked like a bag lady.
You thought I was a princess.

186
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:37,027
<i>You WERE a princess.
My princess!</i>

187
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:39,348
To Marguerite.

188
00:23:40,148 --> 00:23:42,829
To all those who wished
to see me come a cropper.

189
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:46,150
They think I don't know!
Cheers!

190
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:55,754
What's the matter, Louis?
He's in bad form.

191
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:58,035
Go away. We're busy.

192
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:29,268
You're not here as decoration.
Get to work.

193
00:25:29,468 --> 00:25:32,669
To work, you.
This is no child's play.

194
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,670
You'll earn your keep. Enough!

195
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:42,072
Stupid child!
You're in everyone's way!

196
00:25:44,474 --> 00:25:47,875
Go to the trailer.
See to the meal.

197
00:25:48,075 --> 00:25:53,797
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it
for Louis, the Human Snake!

198
00:26:36,893 --> 00:26:38,493
What a little angel.

199
00:26:39,574 --> 00:26:42,495
- How old is she?
- Ten.

200
00:26:43,695 --> 00:26:45,176
No mother?

201
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:46,777
What do you mean?

202
00:26:47,977 --> 00:26:49,818
You be so lonely.

203
00:26:50,698 --> 00:26:53,699
What about a calvados
in your trailer?

204
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,701
Let's go.

205
00:27:43,317 --> 00:27:44,718
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

206
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:50,239
<i>I'm Theresa.</i>

207
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,922
<i>Are your eyes all right, sweetheart?</i>

208
00:27:54,801 --> 00:27:56,121
Yes.

209
00:27:56,522 --> 00:28:00,923
<i>You're so adorable.
Whom do wish to pray for?</i>

210
00:28:01,924 --> 00:28:03,925
I want to pray for Titine.

211
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:07,926
<i>Very well. I shall look after you.</i>

212
00:28:08,126 --> 00:28:09,527
<i>Never forget that.</i>

213
00:28:09,727 --> 00:28:13,129
<i>Whenever you feel lonely,
remember I'm always here.</i>

214
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:32,415
Right, that's it!
You were supposed to change that wheel.

215
00:28:32,655 --> 00:28:36,137
We're all in the same rotten boat!

216
00:28:38,537 --> 00:28:40,738
I don't care!
No? Then screw you!

217
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,820
You shouldn't let
that kind of thing get you down!

218
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,662
I can't stand Caroli!

219
00:28:50,822 --> 00:28:52,942
- You're drunk.
- I'm going solo.

220
00:28:53,143 --> 00:28:55,864
Fat chance of that!
There aren't that many circuses.

221
00:28:56,024 --> 00:28:58,745
I'll manage.

222
00:29:00,145 --> 00:29:03,626
Just when I was getting used to you.
You'll do okay without me!

223
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:11,398
Saint Theresa, please
make him change his mind.

224
00:29:11,411 --> 00:29:14,151
I don't want to
leave the circus.

225
00:30:57,788 --> 00:30:59,509
He's completely messed up.

226
00:31:08,473 --> 00:31:10,193
Is the girl part of the act?

227
00:31:10,473 --> 00:31:12,714
Hold on. Do something.

228
00:31:14,314 --> 00:31:16,795
Before they go, do something.

229
00:31:18,596 --> 00:31:20,597
Come on, do something.

230
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:16,617
Bravo!

231
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,701
That's my daughter!

232
00:32:36,025 --> 00:32:39,225
Grasse. October 1963

233
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:46,628
I'm sick of this carrot juice.
You'll drink it as long as I'm nursing you.

234
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:55,232
I like it dark.
The sun will do you good.

235
00:33:06,836 --> 00:33:12,238
It's hard I know,
but you need a lot of rest...

236
00:33:12,438 --> 00:33:13,838
and patience.

237
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:18,841
Your husband phoned today...
No point.

238
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:25,042
What bothers me
is that I exaggerated.

239
00:33:27,043 --> 00:33:30,244
The past 3 years were awful.

240
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:33,045
You're a performer.

241
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,246
Simone?

242
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:45,050
I suppose I'll never sing again?

243
00:34:05,257 --> 00:34:08,538
Paris, Montmartre. October 1935.

244
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,541
What's up with you?

245
00:34:14,941 --> 00:34:16,661
I'm hungry.

246
00:34:44,672 --> 00:34:46,872
First we sing, then we eat.

247
00:34:47,072 --> 00:34:51,274
Sing alone and you're a beggar.
When you're a duo it's a show.

248
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,076
I want to sing here.

249
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,400
Hey, you!

250
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,281
No street singing allowed.

251
00:35:11,681 --> 00:35:13,082
Is that a fact?

252
00:35:13,282 --> 00:35:15,082
- How old are you?
- Twenty.

253
00:35:15,283 --> 00:35:16,803
What's that?

254
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:20,964
She's had hardly anything to drink.
Come here.

255
00:35:21,485 --> 00:35:22,805
<i>Do you know 'Du Gris'?</i>

256
00:35:22,966 --> 00:35:25,487
- Oh, sir...
- Shut up!

257
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:30,969
If you sing that, I'll let you go.
That's my beat. I'll look the other way.

258
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:06,421
Next week it's our 21st.
Sisters for 5 years.

259
00:36:07,902 --> 00:36:11,103
What do you prefer, working with me
or in the factory?

260
00:36:11,304 --> 00:36:15,705
I'd rather cut my own throat.
How about you?

261
00:36:15,905 --> 00:36:17,385
What do you mean?

262
00:36:17,626 --> 00:36:21,787
Killing yourself in your little milk shop?
Shut up! Not while we're eating.

263
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:24,708
Anetta, no moaning, okay?

264
00:36:25,388 --> 00:36:27,510
Look, it's your drunken mother.

265
00:36:33,112 --> 00:36:34,312
Edith?

266
00:36:36,712 --> 00:36:38,513
Do you have any change?

267
00:36:46,717 --> 00:36:50,918
That's all?
I haven't much money.

268
00:36:51,238 --> 00:36:53,639
Give me some bank notes.
I don't have any.

269
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,721
- I'm your mother.
- Go to hell!

270
00:37:01,122 --> 00:37:04,523
Shall I sing a song?
Throw her out!

271
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:09,924
I'm a performer. What about you?

272
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:12,245
You'll find out!

273
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:14,566
What'll I find out?
When you're lying in the gutter.

274
00:37:14,726 --> 00:37:18,928
Keep it down or leave!
When you're in need...

275
00:37:19,128 --> 00:37:20,449
Fuck off!

276
00:37:23,129 --> 00:37:26,331
Don't depend on your daughter
giving you a bite to eat.

277
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:30,532
That's enough.
I'm off. Have the rest if you want.

278
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:34,734
You're no singer, you slut!
Leave her alone or you'll answer to me.

279
00:37:35,934 --> 00:37:38,735
Oh, don't bother with that lot!

280
00:37:39,656 --> 00:37:40,856
Fuck you!

281
00:37:41,656 --> 00:37:44,338
Go and prostitute yourself on the street!

282
00:37:45,018 --> 00:37:47,418
While you still can!

283
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,140
Thanks very much.

284
00:38:39,758 --> 00:38:44,039
You'll ruin your voice doing that.
I have to eat.

285
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:45,839
Of course you do.

286
00:38:47,161 --> 00:38:49,041
I'm Louis Leplée.

287
00:38:49,281 --> 00:38:53,763
<i>Here's my card. Come round to Gerney's,
tomorrow at two.</i>

288
00:38:53,963 --> 00:38:57,444
Are you a singer?
No, but I have other talents.

289
00:38:57,684 --> 00:39:01,446
Bring your music with you,
whatever you intend singing.

290
00:39:02,766 --> 00:39:03,966
What if I don't come?

291
00:39:06,047 --> 00:39:08,288
That's up to you, my girl.

292
00:39:29,176 --> 00:39:32,025
This is all you have to
show for a whole day?

293
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:34,898
This is how you reward
my belief in you?

294
00:39:35,378 --> 00:39:37,979
I've put a little aside for my father.
He's sick and he's broke.

295
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:41,580
I'm not a social worker.
No really. He's sick.

296
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:47,462
If I toss you out on the street
maybe you'll get it.

297
00:39:47,703 --> 00:39:48,583
Let her go!

298
00:39:48,783 --> 00:39:53,185
Never! I'd rather starve than be a whore.

299
00:39:53,384 --> 00:39:56,186
If you die, it's your own fault!
Shut up!

300
00:39:57,866 --> 00:39:59,786
I want MORE, is that clear?

301
00:39:59,987 --> 00:40:03,069
Or you spread your legs,
just like the rest.

302
00:40:03,308 --> 00:40:04,789
You first.

303
00:40:13,472 --> 00:40:16,593
Albert, I'm sorry...

304
00:40:16,993 --> 00:40:20,674
Please stay! Leave the bastard.

305
00:40:25,876 --> 00:40:28,077
Give her something to drink.

306
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,879
Are you coming to the Chinese?
Who else is going?

307
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,200
The two Italians.

308
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,601
Plenty of snuff and tobacco.
And the warmth of another body...

309
00:40:39,802 --> 00:40:45,604
Because we did it once,
doesn't mean I wish to do it again.

310
00:40:45,804 --> 00:40:48,685
- Don't start.
- Shall I explain?

311
00:40:48,925 --> 00:40:52,086
I care not a jot for you,
and you want to know why?

312
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:57,328
No, I'm too stupid?
Because I'm an artist.

313
00:40:57,488 --> 00:41:01,409
I'm going to the top. I know it.
I've always known it!

314
00:41:04,811 --> 00:41:06,531
It's the Little Flower...

315
00:41:06,692 --> 00:41:10,613
Saint Theresa,
I foresee great things.

316
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:20,336
Seen her clothes?
She looks ill.

317
00:41:21,097 --> 00:41:23,497
Where did he find her?

318
00:41:39,423 --> 00:41:41,344
She's unbelievable.

319
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,745
Champagne.

320
00:41:44,105 --> 00:41:47,426
The boss is crazy about her.
What a voice!

321
00:41:52,628 --> 00:41:56,829
She's really something, Louis.
Spare me your jealousy, Josette.

322
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,841
What's your name again?
Edith Giovanna Gassion.

323
00:42:28,121 --> 00:42:32,043
Hmm, not very impressive.
I have other names:

324
00:42:32,242 --> 00:42:34,644
Huguette Helias, Tania...

325
00:42:35,925 --> 00:42:38,365
Denise Jay.

326
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:42,647
You've had a manicure!
That wasn't the question.

327
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:47,928
You're just like a bird.
You think so?

328
00:42:48,129 --> 00:42:49,369
Really?

329
00:42:49,529 --> 00:42:53,051
<i>Is 'Little Bird' taken?
Yes, it's taken.</i>

330
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,251
A sparrow...

331
00:42:55,451 --> 00:43:00,133
<i>Would you call a sparrow 'piaf'?
Is that how you say it?</i>

332
00:43:02,254 --> 00:43:04,575
<i>The Little Sparrow. Brilliant!</i>

333
00:43:04,735 --> 00:43:07,655
It's stupid.
What would YOU know?

334
00:43:07,856 --> 00:43:10,656
<i>The Little Sparrow. Brilliant!</i>

335
00:43:10,857 --> 00:43:15,659
<i>You'll need a suitable repertoire.
Bruants 'Les Mômes de la Cloche'.</i>

336
00:43:15,858 --> 00:43:19,860
I know it.
If necessary practise it all night.

337
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,461
We'll start you on Friday.

338
00:43:24,982 --> 00:43:26,743
Show's beginning.

339
00:43:26,982 --> 00:43:30,064
Take care of your protégée.
She's a slow starter.

340
00:43:30,264 --> 00:43:31,784
I'm on my way.

341
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:37,387
Philippo, no more alcohol backstage.

342
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:47,671
What are you doing?
I'd no time to finish it.

343
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:51,392
I'm knitting the sleeve.
Now! We've a full house.

344
00:43:51,551 --> 00:43:54,473
All the more reason!
She can't go on like that!

345
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:58,755
Look, our star is dressing the newcomer.

346
00:43:59,675 --> 00:44:02,876
- That's fine.
- Girls, let's go.

347
00:44:03,076 --> 00:44:06,677
I have to throw up.
Not now. Hurry up.

348
00:44:11,879 --> 00:44:16,881
A day or two ago, on my way home,
Lady Luck led me...

349
00:44:17,081 --> 00:44:18,882
to the artist you'll see tonight.

350
00:44:19,082 --> 00:44:23,484
Here she is, exactly as I first saw her,
an unpolished jewel:

351
00:44:23,964 --> 00:44:27,685
<i>From the street to Gerny's:
The Little Sparrow.</i>

352
00:45:53,196 --> 00:45:55,597
She's like a sister to me.

353
00:46:14,644 --> 00:46:17,926
Did I lie? She's extraordinary.

354
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:09,624
This is the great Jean Mermoz.

355
00:47:09,944 --> 00:47:12,025
This is for you.

356
00:47:12,745 --> 00:47:14,146
Thank you.

357
00:47:14,346 --> 00:47:15,746
Come along, Edith.

358
00:47:16,827 --> 00:47:19,948
You've won them over.
And you'll continue doing just that...

359
00:47:20,148 --> 00:47:23,469
I'm introducing you to someone
who can help your career along.

360
00:47:27,551 --> 00:47:30,352
I'm Marguerite Monnot.
I'm a pianist.

361
00:47:30,552 --> 00:47:33,753
If you need music, I'll gladly supply it.

362
00:47:33,953 --> 00:47:36,354
- Thank you.
- Come.

363
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:42,437
<i>Edith, this is Mr. Jacques Canetti.
Artistic director of Radio Cité.</i>

364
00:47:42,676 --> 00:47:46,838
Miss, I was under your spell.
Thank you.

365
00:47:47,078 --> 00:47:50,960
Please, join us at our table.
I can't. I have to go.

366
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:53,240
What can be so important?

367
00:47:54,841 --> 00:47:56,282
Thank you.

368
00:47:56,442 --> 00:47:57,362
What's the matter?

369
00:47:57,561 --> 00:47:59,362
Wonderful, wonderful...

370
00:48:07,246 --> 00:48:11,367
Get out right now or I'll...
Hit him in the kisser!

371
00:48:11,567 --> 00:48:14,288
I've waited an hour for you!

372
00:48:14,448 --> 00:48:17,089
Go to hell, you bastard!

373
00:48:21,091 --> 00:48:22,371
Stop it.

374
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:16,310
Miss, you're wonderful.

375
00:49:16,311 --> 00:49:20,472
My hand's about to fall off.
More bubbles.

376
00:49:20,712 --> 00:49:22,593
Give me the bottle.

377
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:28,315
I said you should listen to me. Radio is
a powerful medium, am I right, Coquatrix?

378
00:49:28,475 --> 00:49:31,996
<i>But don't underestimate the Music Hall.
Of course not.</i>

379
00:49:32,877 --> 00:49:34,477
I've something for you.

380
00:49:34,717 --> 00:49:36,398
- A song?
- Of course.

381
00:49:36,798 --> 00:49:40,600
Raymond!
Mireille, fetch Raymond!

382
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,601
Somebody here for you.

383
00:49:49,603 --> 00:49:51,684
That big guy wants to see you.

384
00:49:52,604 --> 00:49:58,486
This is Raymond Asso.
Writer, composer, poet.

385
00:49:59,527 --> 00:50:00,607
I'll be right back.

386
00:50:00,807 --> 00:50:02,207
I love your work.

387
00:50:02,727 --> 00:50:05,529
I don't love your face.

388
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:12,731
I've seen you often.

389
00:50:13,932 --> 00:50:15,413
I haven't seen you.

390
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:19,294
Midnight, everyone on their feet!

391
00:50:37,621 --> 00:50:41,622
You're a big star.
Yes, I wear high heels.

392
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:50,505
If you wish...
Call me. I'll be waiting.

393
00:51:10,352 --> 00:51:11,953
Papa Leplée!

394
00:51:13,434 --> 00:51:16,835
A toast to Papa Leplée,
my saviour.

395
00:51:20,836 --> 00:51:25,638
Grasse. October 1963.

396
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:26,140
He was a very discreet man...

397
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:31,982
Were you here yesterday?
Yes, but I didn't see him.

398
00:52:32,262 --> 00:52:36,064
So he was at home.
Perhaps. Too bad.

399
00:52:36,264 --> 00:52:39,985
He was discreet,
so lovely and attentive.

400
00:53:09,596 --> 00:53:12,277
You bring bad luck!

401
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:19,280
It's her fault!

402
00:53:25,762 --> 00:53:27,883
<i>Are you the Little Sparrow?</i>

403
00:53:30,084 --> 00:53:33,285
- Come with me, please.
- Why?

404
00:53:33,485 --> 00:53:34,885
This way.

405
00:53:35,486 --> 00:53:37,766
Let me through.

406
00:53:38,686 --> 00:53:41,287
I'm talking to you.

407
00:53:41,608 --> 00:53:44,009
Have you ties with the underworld?
No.

408
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,370
Leave me alone.

409
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:52,972
And Henri Valette? And George, Johnny the
Sailor and Albert? Never heard of them?

410
00:53:53,492 --> 00:53:56,093
Those are friends of mine.
They've nothing to do with this.

411
00:53:56,894 --> 00:54:02,295
Being an accessory is a criminal of fence.
I'm innocent! I've done nothing.

412
00:54:02,815 --> 00:54:05,617
I've lost everything.
Where were you last night?

413
00:54:05,777 --> 00:54:08,498
I told you: Partying...

414
00:54:10,178 --> 00:54:13,900
Bastards, swine!
This is disgusting!

415
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,180
We're not in the theatre now.

416
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:20,302
It seems you have a
couple of nasty friends.

417
00:54:20,502 --> 00:54:24,824
They're not like that.
Sure, and I'm a cretin.

418
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,706
Have you an explanation?
Not at this time.

419
00:54:29,905 --> 00:54:32,027
It's a disgrace!

420
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:36,188
Go back to the gutter, slag!
Leave her alone!

421
00:54:36,428 --> 00:54:39,909
She didn't do it!
Have you named names?

422
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,430
This is a funeral.
Have a little respect!

423
00:54:46,512 --> 00:54:49,713
Just one more question.
Vultures! Go away!

424
00:54:50,713 --> 00:54:52,714
Out of the way!
Get the hell out of here!

425
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:57,516
It's over. I'm dead.
I've been dragged through the shit.

426
00:54:58,836 --> 00:55:00,917
Forget it.

427
00:55:01,317 --> 00:55:04,118
I haven't done anything!
I know that.

428
00:55:06,919 --> 00:55:08,039
Open up!

429
00:55:16,843 --> 00:55:18,924
- What?
- Simone Berteaut?

430
00:55:20,124 --> 00:55:20,924
Yes.

431
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:24,446
Miss, please come with us.

432
00:55:24,926 --> 00:55:26,206
Why?

433
00:55:26,846 --> 00:55:31,528
Your mother has arranged with the court
for you to be placed in a boarding school.

434
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:36,530
Immediately. Pack your things.

435
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:40,732
No! She's staying here.
This has nothing to do with you.

436
00:55:41,732 --> 00:55:44,453
For the last time: Go and pack.

437
00:55:46,214 --> 00:55:50,936
You want to see me dead!
That's it, isn't it?

438
00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:56,337
Let me go!
She's staying here. Momone!

439
00:55:56,538 --> 00:55:58,618
Edith, don't let them!

440
00:56:00,459 --> 00:56:04,060
My things! I don't have any things!
Do you hear that, you shit?

441
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:08,222
Momone, no!

442
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:18,746
Papa Leplée...

443
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:24,628
Oh, Papa Leplée...

444
00:56:33,151 --> 00:56:35,551
You killed him.
Where's the money?

445
00:56:37,953 --> 00:56:40,753
What can you expect from
a former whore?

446
00:57:21,168 --> 00:57:25,450
Everybody out of the dressing room!
Mamy, you stay.

447
00:57:31,972 --> 00:57:34,893
I need a shot for the pain.

448
00:58:00,263 --> 00:58:02,263
Get the American.

449
00:58:06,905 --> 00:58:08,985
You can come in now.

450
00:58:13,868 --> 00:58:16,989
A triumph. You were magnificent.
Doug?

451
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:24,671
I need fresh air.
I'm going back with you to Chálons.

452
00:58:26,793 --> 00:58:29,873
But that's 400 kilometres away.

453
00:58:31,194 --> 00:58:34,995
You can go to hell!
I'm sick of you all!

454
00:58:35,195 --> 00:58:38,116
You're exhausted.
It's a long journey.

455
00:58:38,277 --> 00:58:41,598
No, no, always no! Drop dead!

456
00:58:59,804 --> 00:59:01,325
Let's go back.

457
00:59:01,485 --> 00:59:02,925
Turn around!

458
00:59:03,605 --> 00:59:06,927
You've ruined it for me!
What's this...

459
00:59:20,692 --> 00:59:22,693
<i>The blood test is a catastrophe.</i>

460
00:59:22,932 --> 00:59:24,861
She has two broken ribs
we're unable to set.

461
00:59:24,874 --> 00:59:26,814
This is going to take weeks.

462
00:59:27,214 --> 00:59:31,096
<i>I'd cancel all engagements.</i>

463
00:59:39,819 --> 00:59:41,619
It's tight enough. Please leave.

464
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:45,221
Doctor, give me an injection so I can sing.

465
00:59:45,421 --> 00:59:48,422
My admiration knows no bounds.

466
00:59:49,103 --> 00:59:51,744
That may be, but I have none.

467
00:59:52,023 --> 00:59:54,625
Cancel the concert.
You're risking your life.

468
00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:58,026
What's life without risk?

469
00:59:58,306 --> 01:00:01,226
What would you say to a new life?
Change your surroundings.

470
01:00:01,747 --> 01:00:03,827
- My what?
- Your surroundings.

471
01:00:04,708 --> 01:00:07,029
Why didn't you call me sooner?

472
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:10,830
I was busy. I didn't know
what you wanted of me.

473
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:14,312
I saw you sing.
You have much to learn.

474
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:17,113
No one's ever said that before.

475
01:00:17,353 --> 01:00:19,482
<i>In three months' time you
won't be that'girl'any more.</i>

476
01:00:19,495 --> 01:00:21,635
<i>Your bar days are over.</i>

477
01:00:21,834 --> 01:00:24,155
<i>He had clear blue eyes
That flashed like lightning</i>

478
01:00:24,315 --> 01:00:26,836
<i>in a storm in the night.</i>

479
01:00:28,037 --> 01:00:31,518
In-a-storm-in-the-night!
Articulation!

480
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:33,439
Again!

481
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:36,840
<i>He had clear blue eyes.</i>

482
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:42,042
Are those words or noises?

483
01:00:42,241 --> 01:00:44,722
What do want of me?
Perfect diction!

484
01:00:44,963 --> 01:00:48,044
- I sing as I speak.
- Badly.

485
01:00:48,724 --> 01:00:52,445
You shout the words
and they lose their meaning.

486
01:00:54,847 --> 01:00:56,047
More slowly, Marguerite.

487
01:00:56,247 --> 01:00:58,367
We've been at it six hours.
Can someone open a window?

488
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:00,329
We'll be doing breathing shortly.

489
01:01:01,048 --> 01:01:02,329
From the top.

490
01:01:06,051 --> 01:01:10,252
<i>He had clear blue eyes, that flashed
like lightning. In a storm...</i>

491
01:01:10,452 --> 01:01:13,053
You're not paying attention!
You're not creating.

492
01:01:14,734 --> 01:01:17,654
<i>You must become the woman in love.</i>

493
01:01:18,655 --> 01:01:20,255
Think as an actress.

494
01:01:23,857 --> 01:01:25,138
He's making fun of me.

495
01:01:25,378 --> 01:01:27,938
We're all tired. We'll take a break.

496
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:32,581
He makes me feel as if I can't sing.

497
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:34,741
Who do you think you are?

498
01:01:35,661 --> 01:01:38,063
Don't be satisfied with half measures.

499
01:01:38,863 --> 01:01:40,983
I've been singing since
I was nine years old.

500
01:01:41,143 --> 01:01:44,865
Take it easy.
This is new and difficult.

501
01:01:45,385 --> 01:01:49,666
You're interpreting something, understand?
You must LIVE the song!

502
01:01:50,867 --> 01:01:53,148
No one's ever had a problem
with my diction before.

503
01:01:53,388 --> 01:01:56,068
No one... like whom?

504
01:01:56,669 --> 01:01:59,390
<i>The riff-raff in Gerny's?
Or on the street?</i>

505
01:02:07,873 --> 01:02:10,754
Do what I say or go back to the gutter.

506
01:02:16,997 --> 01:02:18,477
Edith!

507
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,681
Here's to my girl who
never forgets her vader.

508
01:02:28,881 --> 01:02:30,681
To my little one!

509
01:02:30,882 --> 01:02:33,682
Your mentor, is he rich?

510
01:02:34,082 --> 01:02:36,283
Not a cent... He does it
for the love of art.

511
01:02:36,484 --> 01:02:39,085
For the love of your arse you mean!

512
01:02:39,284 --> 01:02:43,486
Come on, little one, sing.
Sing for us!

513
01:03:33,504 --> 01:03:35,705
That's the way to treat her.

514
01:03:36,306 --> 01:03:38,226
I let her have her own way.

515
01:03:39,907 --> 01:03:41,988
I was too good to her!

516
01:04:06,917 --> 01:04:09,717
You're too stiff.

517
01:04:09,918 --> 01:04:13,920
Like a bare-knuckle fighter.
Performing is an art.

518
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,201
You have to grab the audience.

519
01:04:17,841 --> 01:04:21,122
You have lovely hands.
Use them.

520
01:04:21,442 --> 01:04:22,723
Sing with them.

521
01:04:22,923 --> 01:04:24,403
Again, Marguerite.

522
01:04:28,924 --> 01:04:30,406
Move them.

523
01:04:32,126 --> 01:04:33,726
The hands!

524
01:04:37,448 --> 01:04:38,728
That's it.

525
01:04:40,809 --> 01:04:42,930
- I look stupid.
- Continue.

526
01:04:52,933 --> 01:04:54,334
Put this on.

527
01:04:55,455 --> 01:04:58,736
That's not what people want.
It's my voice they wish to hear.

528
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:02,537
How can you be so talented
and at the same time so dense?

529
01:05:28,147 --> 01:05:30,348
Open the door.
I have to throw up!

530
01:05:30,547 --> 01:05:33,629
- Is she drunk?
- She's in panic.

531
01:05:35,549 --> 01:05:37,550
The audience is waiting.

532
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:42,752
For weeks you've been
pestering me for this gig.

533
01:05:42,952 --> 01:05:46,353
For God's sake take the stage
before the tear the place apart.

534
01:05:46,554 --> 01:05:47,953
She's on her way.

535
01:05:49,155 --> 01:05:52,156
Edith? Three minutes.

536
01:05:52,355 --> 01:05:57,958
This isn't a bar, it's a theatre.
What am I doing here?

537
01:05:59,158 --> 01:06:02,159
Stage fright. It's a good sign.

538
01:06:07,361 --> 01:06:08,681
Edith?

539
01:06:09,762 --> 01:06:10,843
What?

540
01:06:12,563 --> 01:06:16,164
This is it.
This is what we worked hard for.

541
01:06:16,364 --> 01:06:18,365
You can't back down now.

542
01:06:20,966 --> 01:06:22,286
Open the door.

543
01:06:23,567 --> 01:06:25,648
No, I can't do it.

544
01:06:27,969 --> 01:06:29,569
Please, open the door.

545
01:06:33,091 --> 01:06:34,691
On your feet.

546
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:20,432
Ladies and gentlemen, Edith Piaf!

547
01:09:27,954 --> 01:09:31,635
<i>Edith Piaf Triumphs...
...Fame for Street Singer...</i>

548
01:09:32,436 --> 01:09:34,236
<i>The Little Sparrow Premieres...</i>

549
01:09:36,557 --> 01:09:38,758
<i>The first man Who Helped Me...</i>

550
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:42,640
<i>Piaf On Tour...</i>

551
01:09:47,722 --> 01:09:50,243
<i>Edith Piaf's Appearance
in the A.B.C. Theatre...</i>

552
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:08,930
<i>The Little Sparrow is Dead
Long Live Edith Piaf!</i>

553
01:10:23,255 --> 01:10:27,977
<i>"I was hurrying home,
needing your love to lean on,</i>

554
01:10:28,137 --> 01:10:33,979
<i>only to find an empty room.
Waiting and waiting; I know that room."</i>

555
01:10:34,139 --> 01:10:38,380
I can't wait to see you in this piece.
Look out, here comes Canetti.

556
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:42,581
The conductor's been waiting three hours.
So?

557
01:10:42,782 --> 01:10:45,143
The premiere is less than 48 hours away.

558
01:10:45,343 --> 01:10:48,664
Do you know many people whom
Cocteau's written a piece for?

559
01:10:49,584 --> 01:10:51,265
- Miss?
- Yes, Suzanne?

560
01:10:51,465 --> 01:10:55,267
Meurisse called.
Dinner with Mr. Cocteau at eight.

561
01:10:55,466 --> 01:10:56,867
You see?

562
01:10:57,067 --> 01:11:00,468
Ask him to come back at midnight.
Are you sure?

563
01:11:00,668 --> 01:11:04,269
You're worse than Raymond.
Do this, do that.

564
01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:07,471
That's why you fired him.
Stop it.

565
01:11:07,671 --> 01:11:10,952
Do you wish to see the gowns?
Yes, the gowns.

566
01:11:18,595 --> 01:11:22,877
That's all of them.
Careful with those pins.

567
01:11:23,277 --> 01:11:25,598
The simplest one, without the collar.

568
01:11:29,078 --> 01:11:32,000
There's a man at the door...
He has something for you.

569
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,880
- Who is it?
- A soldier.

570
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:38,482
I told him you were busy. He's outside
in the corridor. A bit embarrassed.

571
01:11:38,682 --> 01:11:40,883
Have him come in.

572
01:11:48,886 --> 01:11:50,086
Will you come this way?

573
01:11:57,289 --> 01:12:00,810
Here she is.
Much better without the collar.

574
01:12:01,691 --> 01:12:03,091
Yes?

575
01:12:03,492 --> 01:12:06,292
My name is Michel Emer.
I'm a corporal.

576
01:12:06,493 --> 01:12:09,293
This isn't the army.
What do you want?

577
01:12:12,815 --> 01:12:14,176
I have a song for you.

578
01:12:14,415 --> 01:12:19,097
Not another... I've enough already.
I have a premiere in two days' time.

579
01:12:19,297 --> 01:12:20,618
I wish this one.

580
01:12:20,817 --> 01:12:22,979
Tomorrow I leave for the front.

581
01:12:26,699 --> 01:12:29,300
There's the piano.
You have five minutes.

582
01:12:33,783 --> 01:12:35,183
Edith...

583
01:12:37,904 --> 01:12:39,785
We shall have to wait.

584
01:13:15,918 --> 01:13:17,398
Stop.

585
01:13:19,319 --> 01:13:20,840
I want it.

586
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,720
Everybody out.

587
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:27,122
You can't mean that.
We're already late.

588
01:13:27,322 --> 01:13:28,923
What can't she mean?

589
01:13:29,123 --> 01:13:31,724
Play it. I want it for Bobino.

590
01:13:35,325 --> 01:13:36,845
You can't do that.

591
01:13:37,006 --> 01:13:40,927
Edith Piaf can do whatever she pleases!

592
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:50,731
French, please.

593
01:13:50,931 --> 01:13:54,652
She's too hopeless, too poor...
Help us out here, Charles.

594
01:13:54,932 --> 01:13:56,733
I'm no translator.

595
01:13:57,133 --> 01:14:02,735
<i>'Miserable. And not in the French
tradition of the Can-Can and Gay Paris.'.</i>

596
01:14:02,935 --> 01:14:04,216
A complete flop.

597
01:14:04,456 --> 01:14:07,817
This isn't the first
time I've had to fight.

598
01:14:08,137 --> 01:14:10,738
The Americans want pretty girls, not me.

599
01:14:10,938 --> 01:14:14,459
I'm not the Parisian sex bomb
you were hoping for.

600
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:19,342
Can you picture me in a ballet?
With a feather in my arse?

601
01:14:26,343 --> 01:14:28,945
Go ahead and laugh.
I'm not what they want.

602
01:14:29,224 --> 01:14:30,833
They think I'm too
doleful, THEY are stupid.

603
01:14:30,846 --> 01:14:32,466
Yes, too stupid.

604
01:14:32,746 --> 01:14:36,147
.

605
01:14:37,227 --> 01:14:38,949
.

606
01:14:41,669 --> 01:14:43,830
You made the front page.
Two columns.

607
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:45,351
.

608
01:14:45,551 --> 01:14:46,051
.

609
01:14:49,832 --> 01:14:52,553
.

610
01:14:59,356 --> 01:15:01,837
I can't read it. Translate it.

611
01:15:02,077 --> 01:15:07,238
He says that she shouldn't let you go.
That it would be a mistake.

612
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:09,960
The Americans don't deserve you.

613
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:14,082
I knew something would happen!
I have to change...

614
01:15:14,362 --> 01:15:16,682
Ginou, help me help me choose a dress.

615
01:15:18,362 --> 01:15:21,363
I'm going out tonight. I have a date.

616
01:15:30,247 --> 01:15:31,567
.

617
01:15:35,249 --> 01:15:38,170
What's this, Marcel?
Beef... try it.

618
01:15:41,171 --> 01:15:42,972
It smells like damp dog.

619
01:15:44,252 --> 01:15:46,573
.

620
01:15:46,893 --> 01:15:47,573
What?

621
01:15:47,853 --> 01:15:50,894
.

622
01:15:51,055 --> 01:15:52,375
.

623
01:15:53,976 --> 01:15:56,577
Your English is as good as the meat.

624
01:16:03,379 --> 01:16:05,180
Don't you like it here?

625
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:08,581
I was taken a bit by surprise.
I didn't expect it...

626
01:16:09,581 --> 01:16:16,704
when you phoned to say that as two French
people in New York we should have a meal...

627
01:16:17,384 --> 01:16:21,186
I didn't expect this.
I come here all the time.

628
01:16:25,387 --> 01:16:28,188
You sure know how to spoil a girl.

629
01:16:40,393 --> 01:16:44,394
Have you decided?
Twee broodjes pastrami.

630
01:16:45,195 --> 01:16:52,397
I'll handle this: Two Tournedos Rossini,
and a bottle of Chateau Langelus 1938.

631
01:16:56,919 --> 01:17:01,000
Are you hungry?
It's better than cooked dog.

632
01:17:02,121 --> 01:17:03,481
I'm sorry.

633
01:17:04,001 --> 01:17:06,802
Let's start over. Okay?

634
01:17:08,403 --> 01:17:12,605
How long have you been in New York?
Eight weeks.

635
01:17:13,005 --> 01:17:17,407
And do you like America?
It doesn't interest me at all.

636
01:17:17,606 --> 01:17:19,807
I don't understand them,
and they don't understand me.

637
01:17:20,007 --> 01:17:22,408
You must miss Paris. Terribly.

638
01:17:22,608 --> 01:17:25,089
What do you do when you're not singing?

639
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:31,012
Your like the police with your questions.
I knit.

640
01:17:31,812 --> 01:17:35,213
Give me your size and
I'll knit you a sweater.

641
01:17:35,413 --> 01:17:36,933
No, but thanks all the same...

642
01:17:38,934 --> 01:17:42,015
Those people recognized you.
Really?

643
01:17:44,816 --> 01:17:49,418
<i>They said: 'That schmuck lost his
recent fights. He's washed up.'</i>

644
01:17:49,618 --> 01:17:52,219
I'll show them who's washed up.
No!

645
01:17:53,019 --> 01:17:55,821
Relax. I was joking.

646
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:09,026
It's fine.

647
01:18:19,309 --> 01:18:22,230
Can we be less formal to each other?
Of course.

648
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:26,952
What do you do when you aren't boxing?
I train and I run...

649
01:18:27,112 --> 01:18:31,634
And after the training?
In Morocco I work on my farm.

650
01:18:32,314 --> 01:18:34,034
You have a farm?

651
01:18:34,635 --> 01:18:36,435
I breed pigs.

652
01:18:41,037 --> 01:18:42,837
Well, why not?

653
01:18:46,039 --> 01:18:47,840
Absolutely. Why not?

654
01:18:48,039 --> 01:18:51,121
It's a fine farm: Modern,
with superb, fat pigs.

655
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,321
Who takes care of them when you're boxing?
My wife.

656
01:19:02,564 --> 01:19:03,925
You have...

657
01:19:05,126 --> 01:19:06,446
wonderful hands.

658
01:19:08,967 --> 01:19:12,769
Did you hear what I said, Momone?
You have really beautiful fingers.

659
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:15,930
Listen.

660
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:18,171
What colour are your eyes?

661
01:19:18,651 --> 01:19:22,652
He leaned over...
And his breath smelled.

662
01:19:22,853 --> 01:19:26,053
You can be such a bitch!
He is of course a pig breeder.

663
01:19:26,254 --> 01:19:28,975
- He said...
- Violet blue.

664
01:19:29,255 --> 01:19:30,975
Of course, violet blue.

665
01:19:31,456 --> 01:19:35,257
It was the way he said it.
As though he was a child.

666
01:19:36,857 --> 01:19:40,458
Then he said:
You're just like a fairy.

667
01:19:41,459 --> 01:19:43,780
A bit of an exaggeration.

668
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:15,151
Did you kiss him?
I didn't dare.

669
01:20:16,592 --> 01:20:19,473
It was a wonderful evening.
Too short.

670
01:20:22,194 --> 01:20:25,875
Will you come and see me box?
Of course.

671
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:30,357
Did he try to kiss you?

672
01:20:30,797 --> 01:20:32,998
I don't know if he even thought about it.

673
01:20:33,798 --> 01:20:35,279
And I'm supposed to believe that!

674
01:20:35,479 --> 01:20:37,480
I'll come to see you sing.

675
01:20:41,361 --> 01:20:43,082
Goodnight.

676
01:20:47,283 --> 01:20:49,484
He's the love of my life...

677
01:22:18,717 --> 01:22:20,918
You were superb.

678
01:22:21,117 --> 01:22:24,919
Mr. Lucien Roupp,
Mr. Cerdan's manager.

679
01:22:25,319 --> 01:22:28,720
Mr. Jameson, of CBS television.

680
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,841
.

681
01:22:43,406 --> 01:22:44,726
Marlene.

682
01:22:47,727 --> 01:22:51,929
Good evening. I'm sorry,
I just wanted to say something.

683
01:22:54,329 --> 01:22:57,050
I haven't been in Paris in years.

684
01:22:57,330 --> 01:23:02,533
But this evening, when you sang
I was right back there again..

685
01:23:02,933 --> 01:23:05,414
On her streets, beneath her skies.

686
01:23:05,854 --> 01:23:09,135
Your voice is the soul of Paris.

687
01:23:09,535 --> 01:23:13,617
You took me with you on your travels.
You brought tears to my eyes.

688
01:23:14,937 --> 01:23:19,138
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.
Thank you.

689
01:23:56,033 --> 01:23:57,553
Come on.

690
01:24:03,755 --> 01:24:08,437
I'm beginning to like this city.
The stars are out tonight.

691
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:10,757
Let's go.

692
01:24:25,363 --> 01:24:29,245
Marc, do you know how long
a frog lives for?

693
01:24:30,364 --> 01:24:32,366
In fairytales or in real life?

694
01:24:34,886 --> 01:24:38,368
No one ever read me fairytales.

695
01:24:38,888 --> 01:24:41,369
You never had the chance to hear them.

696
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:45,571
That's true, but all the same...

697
01:25:31,587 --> 01:25:35,589
Dreux. 13 December 1959

698
01:26:15,123 --> 01:26:16,484
I'm a little tired.

699
01:26:18,484 --> 01:26:19,605
I'll be right back.

700
01:26:38,932 --> 01:26:40,732
Lay her down there.

701
01:26:48,415 --> 01:26:50,936
I'll go back on in a minute.
Out of the question.

702
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:53,017
Nobody tells ME when to stop.

703
01:26:53,698 --> 01:26:57,139
What are we going to do?
Sorry, you'll have to clear the house.

704
01:26:57,619 --> 01:26:59,939
I'm going back there!
No, Edith.

705
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:02,621
I have to continue.
It would be suicide.

706
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:04,101
You're going to hospital.

707
01:27:05,821 --> 01:27:08,823
No, I'm begging you!

708
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:13,705
She left hospital only three weeks ago.
There'll be more galas.

709
01:27:14,505 --> 01:27:17,506
Take me back to the stage.

710
01:27:18,226 --> 01:27:20,427
I have to sing.

711
01:27:20,628 --> 01:27:23,629
I have to sing, Louis.
I have no choice.

712
01:27:24,429 --> 01:27:27,150
Edith, please...

713
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:30,431
- Can't you hear them?
- Stop...

714
01:27:31,631 --> 01:27:32,912
Shut that door!

715
01:27:33,432 --> 01:27:35,033
Take me back there, Louis.

716
01:27:35,553 --> 01:27:39,154
If I don't sing tonight...

717
01:27:39,714 --> 01:27:46,436
If I don't sing one song at least,
I'll lose faith in myself. Do you follow?

718
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:02,242
Doctor...

719
01:28:03,963 --> 01:28:05,643
do what you have to do.

720
01:28:30,773 --> 01:28:33,854
Not this time, boys.

721
01:28:34,254 --> 01:28:37,576
You think I'm going to collapse,
but I'm in great shape.

722
01:28:37,736 --> 01:28:40,457
Don't you dare write that
this is my suicide tour!

723
01:28:45,658 --> 01:28:47,059
<i>'Padam'!</i>

724
01:30:14,011 --> 01:30:17,212
<i>Saint Theresa,
first of all my thanks...</i>

725
01:30:18,092 --> 01:30:22,814
<i>I know you're behind it all.
You sent him to me.</i>

726
01:30:23,694 --> 01:30:27,376
<i>I've found love, thanks to you.</i>

727
01:30:28,176 --> 01:30:31,697
<i>Baby Jesus, protect Marcel.</i>

728
01:31:44,924 --> 01:31:46,125
Come on, Marcel!

729
01:31:48,446 --> 01:31:49,406
No!

730
01:31:49,725 --> 01:31:52,927
It's too early, Edith.
He's going to win. I feel it.

731
01:31:53,408 --> 01:31:55,649
If things go wrong, you've a problem.
What do you mean?

732
01:31:58,209 --> 01:32:00,930
If there's no problem,
I'll call you. Now go.

733
01:32:12,934 --> 01:32:14,134
Hurry up!

734
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:31,141
Come on, Marcel!

735
01:32:47,147 --> 01:32:49,147
One more round!

736
01:33:03,672 --> 01:33:05,034
Come on, Marcel!

737
01:33:09,675 --> 01:33:11,156
Finish him off!

738
01:33:48,089 --> 01:33:50,570
What's happening?
Zale is sitting it out.

739
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:20,181
Did he do it?
Is he the world champion?

740
01:35:19,802 --> 01:35:21,804
You look like an angel.

741
01:35:23,604 --> 01:35:25,725
Not a fairy any more?

742
01:35:32,287 --> 01:35:34,128
You're my champion.

743
01:35:34,288 --> 01:35:36,689
I want to be with you always.

744
01:35:37,329 --> 01:35:40,611
There was nothing before I met you.
All that is in the past.

745
01:35:45,012 --> 01:35:46,613
Stay with me.

746
01:35:50,934 --> 01:35:55,016
<i>My dearest, before going to bed last night
I crossed off a day...</i>

747
01:35:55,215 --> 01:35:58,216
<i>a day that was long and short.</i>

748
01:35:58,417 --> 01:36:01,266
<i>Such pain, that plane
flew away with my heart.</i>

749
01:36:01,279 --> 01:36:04,139
<i>My life, my breath...</i>

750
01:36:04,299 --> 01:36:07,500
<i>my sweet boy,
my child, my dearest love...</i>

751
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:12,302
<i>your scent is still on my sheets,
and my heart sleeps without waking...</i>

752
01:36:12,542 --> 01:36:14,703
<i>in the arms of sadness.</i>

753
01:36:14,942 --> 01:36:19,344
<i>Darling, I love you.
What have you done to me?</i>

754
01:36:19,624 --> 01:36:20,545
<i>I miss you.</i>

755
01:36:20,705 --> 01:36:25,027
<i>I'm depressed, lifeless,
as though I'm waiting for something...</i>

756
01:36:25,227 --> 01:36:32,709
<i>hold me close against your heart and know
that nothing means more to me than you.</i>

757
01:36:33,109 --> 01:36:37,631
<i>Bring me back my heart.</i>

758
01:36:37,832 --> 01:36:41,432
<i>Whenever I'm in a restaurant and
hear 'La Vie en Rose'...</i>

759
01:36:41,633 --> 01:36:48,035
<i>If I see, my love, how devoted you are
to your wife and children...</i>

760
01:36:48,235 --> 01:36:50,156
<i>I have the urge to go far away...</i>

761
01:36:50,316 --> 01:36:54,637
<i>and perhaps one day you'll be
grateful for what I've done.</i>

762
01:36:54,838 --> 01:36:59,039
<i>I can't have you to myself
and I can't live without you.</i>

763
01:36:59,239 --> 01:37:02,840
<i>As God is my witness, I
ask nothing for myself...</i>

764
01:37:03,041 --> 01:37:05,641
<i>and am prepared to sacrifice everything.</i>

765
01:37:07,442 --> 01:37:10,443
<i>'If life were to take you from me...</i>

766
01:37:10,644 --> 01:37:14,965
<i>if you should die or be far away,
and you were to love me, I too would die.'.</i>

767
01:37:19,647 --> 01:37:23,448
In three months' time,
wait for it, in April...

768
01:37:23,648 --> 01:37:28,249
<i>I'm going to star in L'Olympia.
Full house and then we're back again.</i>

769
01:37:28,650 --> 01:37:32,251
Your liver is damaged...

770
01:37:32,452 --> 01:37:35,453
you've been ill and need rest.
It's serious this time.

771
01:37:35,652 --> 01:37:38,173
I'm only 44. I'm not dead yet.

772
01:37:38,334 --> 01:37:41,375
Because of all the cancellations
we're broke.

773
01:37:41,534 --> 01:37:43,655
Oh, so it's my fault?

774
01:37:43,855 --> 01:37:47,137
I didn't say that.
The taxman is breathing down our necks.

775
01:37:47,657 --> 01:37:50,338
<i>We have to pay 120.000 franc.</i>

776
01:37:50,978 --> 01:37:55,860
I only have jaundice! That won't last
100 years. Don't exaggerate.

777
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:59,261
<i>I want to sing in L'Olympia.</i>

778
01:38:05,784 --> 01:38:09,945
Anything else?
We shouldn't give in all the time.

779
01:38:10,185 --> 01:38:14,746
I can't watch her all the time. She
discharged herself too soon from hospital.

780
01:38:14,987 --> 01:38:18,868
<i>L'Olympia is in 3 months.
That's going to be a disaster.</i>

781
01:38:19,068 --> 01:38:22,750
She needs this sort of challenge.
This is hopeless.

782
01:38:22,989 --> 01:38:26,591
In that case I'll have to tell the insurers
that we're cancelling everything.

783
01:38:26,751 --> 01:38:30,473
We have to make the decisions for her.
Whether she likes it or not.

784
01:39:22,612 --> 01:39:25,893
<i>I said to myself,
'Edith, it's over.'.</i>

785
01:39:26,092 --> 01:39:29,294
There's someone else. You've lost him.
Did he have an affair?

786
01:39:29,494 --> 01:39:32,376
I he did have, would I be telling you?

787
01:39:32,695 --> 01:39:35,176
He left the restaurant.
I followed him.

788
01:39:35,416 --> 01:39:40,498
My Marcel walked the whole of New York
to eat with an old blind boxer...

789
01:39:40,698 --> 01:39:45,100
whom he'd met a couple of years before.
Can you imagine that?

790
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:51,583
Men like that are scarce.
My Marcel...

791
01:39:51,983 --> 01:39:55,183
that's all you ever talk about.
That's the only thing that counts.

792
01:39:58,785 --> 01:40:03,107
But listen, Ginou,
I'll never have him.

793
01:40:03,706 --> 01:40:07,508
He'll never be mine.
He'll remain with his wife and children.

794
01:40:12,910 --> 01:40:15,191
He phones her every day.

795
01:40:16,631 --> 01:40:20,513
I pretend I don't know what's going on.
I want him to be happy.

796
01:40:22,913 --> 01:40:24,234
I'll be right back.

797
01:40:29,436 --> 01:40:31,317
<i>I could have been Edith Piaf.</i>

798
01:40:32,117 --> 01:40:34,398
There's more in life than chansons.

799
01:40:45,322 --> 01:40:49,324
<i>It's been too long, Marcel!
Call Orly. Book a flight this evening.</i>

800
01:40:49,724 --> 01:40:54,405
SUCH a long ocean sailing:
I'd never survive it. I miss you, Marcel.

801
01:40:54,925 --> 01:40:57,326
I can't bear to be apart from you.

802
01:40:58,407 --> 01:41:01,928
Perhaps I have to return to Paris.
Hold on.

803
01:41:02,128 --> 01:41:05,849
I'm no more than Madame's lapdog.
Stop it...

804
01:41:07,850 --> 01:41:12,932
Rum, coke! Whisky!
People think I'm rubbish.

805
01:41:13,932 --> 01:41:15,933
Getting drunk in Belleville was better.

806
01:41:19,054 --> 01:41:20,815
You abandoned me.

807
01:41:21,455 --> 01:41:22,936
That's enough, Momone!

808
01:41:25,216 --> 01:41:26,937
Take her away from here.

809
01:41:31,539 --> 01:41:33,339
I'm taking the boat.

810
01:41:34,259 --> 01:41:36,261
To your career, Edith!

811
01:41:41,542 --> 01:41:44,663
Marcel, leave tonight. For me.

812
01:42:34,562 --> 01:42:39,364
You won't be sleeping if I'm not there.
Thank God for that, Marcel.

813
01:42:49,247 --> 01:42:52,569
I'll make you coffee.
You stay where you are.

814
01:42:58,770 --> 01:43:00,772
Let me serve you.

815
01:43:17,378 --> 01:43:19,258
What are you doing here?

816
01:43:36,585 --> 01:43:38,386
I knew you'd come.

817
01:43:40,786 --> 01:43:43,667
Lucien found it hard to get tickets.

818
01:43:48,869 --> 01:43:50,590
I've a gift for you.

819
01:43:53,591 --> 01:43:57,672
You don't look too well.
You could do with some sun. You're pale.

820
01:44:06,715 --> 01:44:07,916
Ginou!

821
01:44:09,517 --> 01:44:11,517
I'm looking for that watch!

822
01:44:17,799 --> 01:44:21,001
Wat nou?
I'm looking for that watch!

823
01:44:21,201 --> 01:44:25,283
In the red Cartier box.
Shit, it was right here!

824
01:44:34,326 --> 01:44:35,526
What's the matter with you?

825
01:44:35,686 --> 01:44:39,528
I'm looking for Marcel's watch!
Where is that watch?

826
01:44:44,209 --> 01:44:48,331
I'm looking for Marcel's watch!
What?

827
01:44:49,931 --> 01:44:53,293
Louis? What's the matter?

828
01:44:55,614 --> 01:44:57,695
I want you to be brave, Edith.

829
01:44:59,615 --> 01:45:01,136
Is it Marcel?

830
01:45:02,616 --> 01:45:03,936
What?

831
01:45:06,618 --> 01:45:08,618
The plane crashed...

832
01:45:26,745 --> 01:45:28,026
Marcel!

833
01:45:30,907 --> 01:45:32,507
Marcel!

834
01:47:04,541 --> 01:47:06,861
What more can I tell you?

835
01:47:07,862 --> 01:47:09,703
They say you're the best
clairvoyant there is.

836
01:47:09,862 --> 01:47:14,664
This is your third visit this week.
I've told you all I know.

837
01:47:14,944 --> 01:47:16,785
Why do you keep coming back?

838
01:47:18,466 --> 01:47:20,947
So you can tell me again.

839
01:47:22,387 --> 01:47:25,349
So that I know why I
should continue living.

840
01:47:26,869 --> 01:47:29,870
He died in the air, so that
is where he must be...

841
01:47:41,594 --> 01:47:44,075
<i>California, August 1955</i>

842
01:47:52,078 --> 01:47:57,080
Jack Peals! Can we go any faster?
I need air.

843
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:59,761
I love the heat.
It makes me dizzy.

844
01:48:00,681 --> 01:48:03,202
Step on it.
Our pin-up is melting!

845
01:48:04,563 --> 01:48:09,885
I'm getting a sore throat. Then you can
take care of me. Like a good husband.

846
01:48:10,085 --> 01:48:13,686
The best I've had.
The FIRST you've had!

847
01:48:14,967 --> 01:48:17,687
Are you going to spend
the day gawping at up?

848
01:48:21,088 --> 01:48:22,690
I'm feeling nauseous.

849
01:48:23,090 --> 01:48:26,010
Look out, you'll drive us off the road.

850
01:48:26,891 --> 01:48:32,293
Let me drive. Stop, I'll drive.
Then Ginou can throw up.

851
01:48:37,495 --> 01:48:38,496
Go on, Ginou.

852
01:48:39,895 --> 01:48:41,377
May I, Madame?

853
01:48:43,497 --> 01:48:45,097
Go ahead, Ginou!

854
01:48:45,698 --> 01:48:47,899
Very good!

855
01:48:53,701 --> 01:48:54,701
Bye bye, Ginou!

856
01:48:55,622 --> 01:48:57,302
Wait for me!

857
01:49:01,104 --> 01:49:02,584
My, you're some driver.

858
01:49:05,705 --> 01:49:10,507
Our journey hasn't been wasted after all.
We just murdered a tree.

859
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:22,991
My God, the service here is awful.
Can nobody take our order?

860
01:49:24,191 --> 01:49:28,914
<i>Take it easy. You're no star here.
Mocambo is tonight.</i>

861
01:49:29,114 --> 01:49:32,915
Remind me who invited us.

862
01:49:33,115 --> 01:49:36,917
Marlon Brando, Ginger Rogers,
Mr. Chaplin...

863
01:49:40,718 --> 01:49:42,198
What's this?

864
01:49:43,799 --> 01:49:47,720
We didn't order that swill!
That's your cocktail.

865
01:49:56,723 --> 01:49:59,925
Don't touch me!
I said don't touch me!

866
01:50:00,525 --> 01:50:02,205
Here, wipe it off.

867
01:50:04,727 --> 01:50:06,727
We should get a divorce.

868
01:50:11,409 --> 01:50:14,850
How many times a day are
you shooting up now?

869
01:50:15,731 --> 01:50:17,331
About ten.

870
01:50:18,612 --> 01:50:24,054
Excuse me for being so direct,
but why do you do it?

871
01:50:27,135 --> 01:50:29,336
So that my body doesn't protest.

872
01:50:32,937 --> 01:50:36,859
When did you start injecting every day?

873
01:50:37,019 --> 01:50:40,219
Five years ago, after the plane crash.

874
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:44,941
I contracted rheumatism.
I couldn't knit any more.

875
01:50:46,862 --> 01:50:49,664
You're very dependent on it.

876
01:50:50,543 --> 01:50:53,345
- It's an addiction...
- Doctor?

877
01:50:53,824 --> 01:50:56,466
I want my wife to kick the habit.

878
01:50:59,267 --> 01:51:02,468
I want to be well again. I can do it.

879
01:51:07,149 --> 01:51:11,551
October 1960 - 5 years later

880
01:51:31,759 --> 01:51:33,759
Danielle, a chair!

881
01:51:42,963 --> 01:51:44,363
Edith?

882
01:51:51,285 --> 01:51:52,767
Here you are.

883
01:51:53,687 --> 01:51:55,047
Sit down now.

884
01:52:05,371 --> 01:52:06,571
Bruno...

885
01:52:12,173 --> 01:52:14,494
<i>there won't be another
L'Olympia.</i>

886
01:52:20,897 --> 01:52:22,377
I understand.

887
01:52:33,861 --> 01:52:35,182
No!

888
01:52:43,304 --> 01:52:48,187
The composer Charles Dumont and
the lyricist Michel Vaucaire are here.

889
01:52:48,386 --> 01:52:51,468
<i>They wish us to hear their chanson.</i>

890
01:52:59,311 --> 01:53:01,591
Quickly then. I'm tired.

891
01:53:18,678 --> 01:53:23,079
<i>No, no nothing at all</i>

892
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:28,002
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

893
01:53:29,001 --> 01:53:33,403
<i>not the good times I had</i>

894
01:53:33,884 --> 01:53:37,725
<i>not the pain
it means nothing to me.</i>

895
01:53:37,885 --> 01:53:39,205
Stop!

896
01:53:40,406 --> 01:53:43,807
I love it. Carry on!

897
01:53:44,608 --> 01:53:47,209
<i>With my souvenirs.</i>

898
01:53:47,808 --> 01:53:50,289
<i>I build a fire</i>

899
01:53:50,529 --> 01:53:52,530
<i>my sadness, my pleasure.</i>

900
01:53:52,691 --> 01:53:55,011
<i>I don't need it any longer</i>

901
01:53:55,411 --> 01:53:57,732
<i>the loves are gone</i>

902
01:53:57,892 --> 01:54:00,213
<i>the traumas as well</i>

903
01:54:00,413 --> 01:54:03,014
<i>erased for ever.</i>

904
01:54:03,214 --> 01:54:04,534
<i>I must start anew.</i>

905
01:54:04,694 --> 01:54:06,296
You're wonderful!

906
01:54:06,696 --> 01:54:08,645
That's precisely what I
was looking out for.

907
01:54:08,658 --> 01:54:10,617
Unbelievable. This is so ME!

908
01:54:11,497 --> 01:54:13,618
That is MY life. That is me!

909
01:54:13,898 --> 01:54:19,020
<i>Call Coquatrix. L'Olympia is on!
Play it again. It's exquisite.</i>

910
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:23,101
<i>No, no nothing at all</i>

911
01:54:24,421 --> 01:54:27,903
<i>no, I regret nothing at all.</i>

912
01:54:47,831 --> 01:54:50,712
<i>You're doing well, my dear.
Your friend, Marguerite'.</i>

913
01:54:52,232 --> 01:54:55,433
Everyone's here: Aznavour,
Mr. Cocteau, Yves Montand.

914
01:54:55,633 --> 01:54:58,634
Montand's here?
I read that he wasn't coming.

915
01:54:58,835 --> 01:55:00,035
He's come for you!

916
01:55:00,235 --> 01:55:04,236
They've been waiting a half hour.
The room is jumping.

917
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:17,441
Not too tight?

918
01:55:20,042 --> 01:55:22,844
- Who's that?
- A friend.

919
01:55:43,450 --> 01:55:45,531
Let's go, Edith.

920
01:55:45,852 --> 01:55:47,052
Up you get.

921
01:55:52,654 --> 01:55:53,935
My crucifix?

922
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:56,655
My crucifix...

923
01:55:59,256 --> 01:56:00,337
My crucifix?

924
01:56:00,577 --> 01:56:03,538
I forgot. I'll fetch it.
I won't sing without it.

925
01:56:04,659 --> 01:56:07,260
Everybody out!

926
01:57:15,284 --> 01:57:19,486
<i>Grasse, Oktober 1963
The Final Night.</i>

927
01:57:19,806 --> 01:57:21,087
See you tomorrow.

928
01:57:21,286 --> 01:57:22,887
I'll do it.

929
01:57:28,089 --> 01:57:33,491
I'm afraid, Simone. I'm losing my memory.
It's serious this time.

930
01:57:34,891 --> 01:57:37,293
My brain is confused.

931
01:57:37,693 --> 01:57:43,094
I try to remember things
but they won't come.

932
01:57:44,775 --> 01:57:48,777
Things do come, but not the things I want.

933
01:57:51,497 --> 01:57:55,700
I wanted to see his watch.
Don't you remember? Marcel's watch?

934
01:57:55,899 --> 01:58:00,701
I'm afraid not. I never knew him.
I wanted to see his watch...

935
01:58:18,708 --> 01:58:20,308
What a face!

936
01:58:21,989 --> 01:58:23,830
You have wild eyes.

937
01:58:27,111 --> 01:58:28,912
I like the little one.

938
01:59:02,324 --> 01:59:05,205
- Simone?
- Yes, Edith?

939
01:59:07,525 --> 01:59:09,726
I haven't said my prayers.

940
01:59:12,727 --> 01:59:15,448
I must get down on my knees and pray.

941
01:59:15,929 --> 01:59:20,130
No one will think less of you
if you don't get down on your knees.

942
01:59:20,410 --> 01:59:23,131
I wish to pray for my papa.

943
02:00:23,754 --> 02:00:25,074
Marcelle...

944
02:00:26,554 --> 02:00:27,754
Marcelle...

945
02:00:28,755 --> 02:00:30,756
my little ghost...

946
02:00:32,757 --> 02:00:37,358
Only Momone knows.
I must tell you about my ghost.

947
02:00:37,558 --> 02:00:40,279
Take it easy, Edith. Marcelle!

948
02:00:49,083 --> 02:00:52,364
Marcelle, go to bed. Enough for today.

949
02:00:52,564 --> 02:00:55,453
And I'm supposed to look
out for the police.

950
02:00:55,466 --> 02:00:58,366
And your child!
What Louis up to?

951
02:00:59,647 --> 02:01:01,167
It's your father.

952
02:01:05,889 --> 02:01:07,089
Has she eaten?

953
02:01:07,370 --> 02:01:11,091
They're saying you were on the
street with her. Who says that?

954
02:01:11,250 --> 02:01:14,372
You only have her twice a month
and you can't even do THAT right!

955
02:01:14,572 --> 02:01:16,173
I told you: Not on the street!

956
02:01:25,576 --> 02:01:26,376
Come quick.

957
02:01:29,257 --> 02:01:30,297
It's Marcelle! Come quick!

958
02:01:34,579 --> 02:01:36,060
She's in the hospital!

959
02:01:57,907 --> 02:01:59,789
Are you her mother?

960
02:02:00,309 --> 02:02:05,111
Meningitis. We could do nothing. I'm sorry.

961
02:02:38,203 --> 02:02:39,683
Edith?

962
02:02:41,123 --> 02:02:42,885
I have the crucifix.

963
02:03:00,891 --> 02:03:03,292
They told me you were on the beach.

964
02:03:04,212 --> 02:03:08,214
Thanks for agreeing to this interview.
My pleasure.

965
02:03:09,294 --> 02:03:11,815
How strange to meet you so far from Paris.

966
02:03:12,015 --> 02:03:14,416
I'm never far from Paris.

967
02:03:15,216 --> 02:03:20,338
I have a list of question. Just say
the first thing that occurs to you.

968
02:03:26,420 --> 02:03:29,822
What is your favourite colour?
Blue.

969
02:03:30,022 --> 02:03:33,823
Your favourite food?
Roast beef.

970
02:03:35,424 --> 02:03:40,506
Would you like to live sensibly?
I already do.

971
02:03:44,627 --> 02:03:49,309
<i>Who are your most loyal friends?
All my genuine friends.</i>

972
02:03:51,549 --> 02:03:54,231
<i>If you were unable to sing...</i>

973
02:03:54,830 --> 02:03:58,112
<i>Then I could no longer live.</i>

974
02:03:59,152 --> 02:04:01,033
<i>Are you afraid of death?</i>

975
02:04:02,434 --> 02:04:04,834
<i>I'm more afraid of loneliness.</i>

976
02:04:06,355 --> 02:04:11,036
<i>Do you pray?
Yes, for I believe in love.</i>

977
02:04:12,237 --> 02:04:14,238
I don't want to, Simone.

978
02:04:15,158 --> 02:04:18,839
Where's Theo? I want my husband.

979
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:21,560
Theo will be here in less than an hour.

980
02:04:22,521 --> 02:04:25,322
<i>What was the finest part
of the show for you?</i>

981
02:04:26,242 --> 02:04:28,363
<i>When the curtain went up.</i>

982
02:04:43,329 --> 02:04:45,649
<i>And as a woman?</i>

983
02:04:46,850 --> 02:04:48,851
<i>My first kiss.</i>

984
02:04:50,851 --> 02:04:55,333
<i>Do you like the night?
Yes, with lots of light.</i>

985
02:04:55,573 --> 02:05:00,055
<i>The morning?
With a piano and friends.</i>

986
02:05:00,254 --> 02:05:01,455
<i>The evening?</i>

987
02:05:01,655 --> 02:05:04,376
<i>Because that's our morning.</i>

988
02:05:09,658 --> 02:05:11,739
You see, you're breathing.

989
02:05:19,462 --> 02:05:21,343
I can't go back.

990
02:05:25,184 --> 02:05:26,865
I can't.

991
02:06:04,398 --> 02:06:08,000
<i>What advice would you give a woman?</i>

992
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:10,680
<i>Love.</i>

993
02:06:10,881 --> 02:06:13,681
<i>- To a young girl?
- Love.</i>

994
02:06:13,882 --> 02:06:17,203
<i>- To a child?
- Love.</i>

995
02:06:20,164 --> 02:06:22,285
Whom are you knitting for?

996
02:06:23,885 --> 02:06:26,687
For anyone who'll wear my sweaters.

997
02:06:28,287 --> 02:06:32,008
That's it. I hope it wasn't too long.

998
02:06:34,169 --> 02:06:37,610
Thank you so much, madame.
Thank you too.

999
02:07:18,515 --> 02:07:23,217
<i>No, no nothing at all</i>

1000
02:07:23,815 --> 02:07:27,999
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

1001
02:07:28,797 --> 02:07:33,897
<i>not the good times I had</i>

1002
02:07:34,057 --> 02:07:39,476
<i>not the pain
it means nothing to me</i>

1003
02:07:39,636 --> 02:07:44,338
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

1004
02:07:45,056 --> 02:07:49,121
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

1005
02:07:49,838 --> 02:07:54,620
<i>it is done, wiped away</i>

1006
02:07:55,098 --> 02:08:02,351
<i>erased, the past
interests me not at all</i>

1007
02:08:02,670 --> 02:08:05,778
<i>with my souvenirs.</i>

1008
02:08:06,336 --> 02:08:08,647
<i>I build a fire</i>

1009
02:08:09,046 --> 02:08:11,836
<i>my sadness, my pleasure.</i>

1010
02:08:12,035 --> 02:08:14,705
<i>I don't need it any longer</i>

1011
02:08:14,944 --> 02:08:17,215
<i>the loves are gone</i>

1012
02:08:17,733 --> 02:08:20,124
<i>the traumas as well</i>

1013
02:08:20,404 --> 02:08:23,192
<i>erased for ever.</i>

1014
02:08:23,711 --> 02:08:27,975
<i>I must start anew</i>

1015
02:08:28,971 --> 02:08:34,471
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

1016
02:08:34,750 --> 02:08:38,934
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

1017
02:08:39,532 --> 02:08:44,713
<i>not the good times I had</i>

1018
02:08:44,912 --> 02:08:50,570
<i>not the pain
it means nothing to me</i>

1019
02:08:50,809 --> 02:08:55,592
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

1020
02:08:55,751 --> 02:08:59,975
<i>no, I regret nothing at all</i>

1021
02:09:00,772 --> 02:09:02,845
<i>because my life</i>

1022
02:09:03,323 --> 02:09:08,823
<i>and my joy today</i>

1024
02:09:09,420 --> 02:09:17,391
<i>begins with you.</i>
