1
00:00:21,107 --> 00:00:22,676
Leave us.

2
00:00:30,457 --> 00:00:34,217
You broke the palanquin
because I didn't promote you?

3
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:38,326
Coming up with that nonsense
for your confession...

4
00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:40,127
must have been difficult.

5
00:00:41,927 --> 00:00:46,127
I have finally found the answer.

6
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:50,627
With that tilting bowl,

7
00:00:51,397 --> 00:00:57,367
you wanted to tell me to dump
you like the water in the bowl.

8
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:01,127
How did you know...

9
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:06,197
I would one day have to
consider abandoning you?

10
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:10,727
I never thought I would
be branded a traitor,

11
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:17,427
or that a day would come where
you would have to discard me.

12
00:01:18,137 --> 00:01:20,716
When I first made the tilting bowl,

13
00:01:20,717 --> 00:01:24,097
I thought I was the bowl, not the water.

14
00:01:25,327 --> 00:01:29,326
Then, when other slaves came to me,

15
00:01:29,327 --> 00:01:31,897
and begged to be made commoners,

16
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:36,627
I realised I was not
capable of helping anyone.

17
00:01:37,827 --> 00:01:40,227
I was water that should be discarded.

18
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:46,527
I believe you are a tilting bowl
capable of saving all of Joseon.

19
00:01:47,197 --> 00:01:48,996
Your Majesty.

20
00:01:48,997 --> 00:01:53,906
Discard me and live for the people.
That is my message to you.

21
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:55,426
You are not water.

22
00:01:55,427 --> 00:01:56,596
(King Sejong)

23
00:01:56,597 --> 00:01:58,536
Even if you are,

24
00:01:58,537 --> 00:02:02,456
I will keep you. I will not let you go.

25
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:04,126
Your Majesty.

26
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:06,526
You must discard me first.

27
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:10,697
As much as you loved me, I
must be the first you let go.

28
00:02:13,097 --> 00:02:15,576
I am so relieved.

29
00:02:15,577 --> 00:02:16,926
I am distracting...

30
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:21,836
your opposition from seeing the
alphabet you are creating.

31
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:25,627
I cannot abandon you whatever you say.

32
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:31,816
You are destined to give up on me.

33
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:33,626
You are wise,

34
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:36,627
and you wish to remain a wise king.

35
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:42,227
A wise king punishes a traitor
for the good of the nation.

36
00:02:43,127 --> 00:02:46,006
If you wish to be called a fool,

37
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:48,026
then protect me.

38
00:02:48,027 --> 00:02:50,766
Follow your heart and shield me.

39
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:52,896
I want to live.

40
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:57,426
Announce to the world
that I tried to kill you,

41
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:01,416
but that you choose to forgive
me and keep me close.

42
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:03,727
I'd like that more than anything.

43
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:11,467
But you cannot do that, Your Majesty.

44
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:14,326
You risked your health for your alphabet.

45
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,467
You'd give your life for your people.

46
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:20,267
You can't give those up for one man.

47
00:03:21,227 --> 00:03:26,467
You cannot protect your alphabet
unless you get rid of me.

48
00:03:28,497 --> 00:03:30,167
You are...

49
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:33,836
breaking my heart.

50
00:03:33,837 --> 00:03:35,827
Let it break.

51
00:03:36,627 --> 00:03:41,527
Think of it that I sacrificed
myself for the good of Joseon.

52
00:03:41,927 --> 00:03:43,527
Let your heart break.

53
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:48,367
I pray that you make it quick, so that...

54
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:51,796
I don't have false hopes.

55
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:56,197
Be harsh and cold and treat
me the worst you can.

56
00:03:57,127 --> 00:03:59,427
That would make me happy.

57
00:04:00,027 --> 00:04:01,936
I cannot do that.

58
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:03,966
Treat you harshly?

59
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:07,167
Why do you ask such a thing of me?

60
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:12,627
I cannot harm an innocent citizen.

61
00:04:13,097 --> 00:04:16,527
Yeong Sil, you are one of my people.

62
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:23,427
Do not ask me to do something
that you know I cannot do.

63
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:29,427
Your Majesty.

64
00:04:38,837 --> 00:04:40,427
Your Majesty.

65
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:45,627
Jang Yeong Sil has been
questioned and we have the facts.

66
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:50,337
It is time you decide his punishment.

67
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:02,527
Prime Minister.

68
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:09,127
I am trying to think of a way to save him.

69
00:05:09,597 --> 00:05:12,866
How do you expect me to
decide his punishment?

70
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:15,706
(Hwang Hui)

71
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:17,797
(Lee Chun)

72
00:05:20,727 --> 00:05:23,897
(Ha Yeon)

73
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:44,967
I would kill all those
foolish nobles if I could.

74
00:05:45,297 --> 00:05:50,527
It isn't solely because of them
that we're about to lose Yeong Sil.

75
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:53,026
Everything he accomplished...

76
00:05:53,027 --> 00:05:56,827
since he entered the
Palace has been a miracle.

77
00:05:57,697 --> 00:06:02,426
To some people, he means less than a rock,

78
00:06:02,427 --> 00:06:05,197
but to some, he is a source of fear.

79
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:07,596
That will continue.

80
00:06:07,597 --> 00:06:11,166
The ignorant won't care for knowledge,

81
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:13,366
and the learned are biased.

82
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:15,696
Yeong Sil studies and theorises
to change the world.

83
00:06:15,697 --> 00:06:18,906
And they will fear the
change he will bring.

84
00:06:18,907 --> 00:06:20,716
Joseon isn't able to...

85
00:06:20,717 --> 00:06:24,316
handle a man of his calibre.

86
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,227
He presents us with a
problem we must all face.

87
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:29,967
We aren't as clever,

88
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:32,067
but we also...

89
00:06:32,527 --> 00:06:34,866
need Joseon to survive.

90
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:37,927
Calm your fury and be reasonable.

91
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:42,266
Let us focus on what Yeong Sil and
the things you made together...

92
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:45,067
mean to Joseon and its future.

93
00:06:46,227 --> 00:06:48,597
I have no doubt that...

94
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:52,767
the King will make the right decision.

95
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,667
Master Chung Bo...

96
00:06:59,197 --> 00:07:01,496
knew the King would falter,

97
00:07:01,497 --> 00:07:04,167
so he left us this message.

98
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:06,496
Read it aloud.

99
00:07:06,497 --> 00:07:09,366
"We cannot let any record
of Jang Yeong Sil"...

100
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:11,826
"or his studies be left
for future generations."

101
00:07:11,827 --> 00:07:16,346
"Any mention of him will bring upon
another wave of scientific studies."

102
00:07:16,347 --> 00:07:20,366
"I trust you will work hard and
never stop until all records"...

103
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:22,126
"of Jang Yeong Sil"...

104
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:24,827
"are scrubbed or altered forever."

105
00:07:26,897 --> 00:07:28,567
We have Jo Mal Saeng...

106
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:31,597
and Choi Man Ri.

107
00:07:32,697 --> 00:07:34,996
They are loyal scholars...

108
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,597
and will be willing to help.

109
00:07:37,327 --> 00:07:38,827
Your Majesty.

110
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,466
Jang Yeong Sil is a traitor.

111
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:43,666
Have him hanged,

112
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:48,197
and delete all mention of him
from Palace and public records.

113
00:07:49,397 --> 00:07:51,136
Lord Jo.

114
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,626
How cold you say such a thing?

115
00:07:53,627 --> 00:07:56,496
Why do you want to alter all our records?

116
00:07:56,497 --> 00:07:57,897
He is a traitor.

117
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:01,496
Your Majesty.

118
00:08:01,497 --> 00:08:03,026
You turned a servant...

119
00:08:03,027 --> 00:08:05,326
into a Grand Master,

120
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:09,297
and he tried to kill you because
you didn't promote him further.

121
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:12,786
It is not right that our
future generation...

122
00:08:12,787 --> 00:08:14,697
be allowed to know of him.

123
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:17,926
Hang his head in the square...

124
00:08:17,927 --> 00:08:20,566
to deter others from
making the same mistake.

125
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,667
Royal Advisor Choi!

126
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:38,496
As if ruining his reputation wasn't enough,

127
00:08:38,497 --> 00:08:40,267
they want to delete his records.

128
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,016
The King...

129
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:45,566
needs to make up his mind soon.

130
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,127
The longer he takes, the worse
their demands will become.

131
00:08:50,127 --> 00:08:53,097
They are trying to put pressure on him.

132
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,266
They aren't...

133
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:58,286
trying to scrub his name
from the records...

134
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,897
just because he is a traitor.

135
00:09:01,437 --> 00:09:02,967
They want to...

136
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:06,236
stop people from...

137
00:09:06,237 --> 00:09:08,467
discussing scientific things altogether.

138
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:11,267
I believe that...

139
00:09:11,697 --> 00:09:14,206
the earth we live on...

140
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:15,797
moves around the sun.

141
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:17,896
Why are you...

142
00:09:17,897 --> 00:09:19,766
bringing that up now?

143
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,306
Do you think I am...

144
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:25,027
the first person to think so? I don't.

145
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:27,936
Out of all the others who
observed the stars before me,

146
00:09:27,937 --> 00:09:30,596
some must have reached the same conclusion.

147
00:09:30,597 --> 00:09:32,246
And yet...

148
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:34,296
we have no records of them.

149
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:36,166
Because there are none,

150
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,327
we had nothing to discuss.

151
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:40,626
That's right.

152
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:44,166
The next person would have
to start from nothing again,

153
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:48,566
and if he had an idea, he'd have no
past records to compare them to,

154
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:51,366
so he wouldn't be able
to develop those ideas.

155
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:53,086
He would give up...

156
00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:54,766
or lost interest.

157
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:58,197
Yes. We need records to
further our studies,

158
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,766
and discuss such issues.

159
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,646
Records and discussion.

160
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:04,436
Those are...

161
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,497
the life of any topic of study.

162
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:11,997
We cannot lose Grand Master
Jang when we risk...

163
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:14,767
losing all his records as well.

164
00:10:15,937 --> 00:10:17,296
Until the very end,

165
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:19,236
I shall do...

166
00:10:19,237 --> 00:10:21,296
my duty as best I can.

167
00:10:21,297 --> 00:10:25,436
Your Majesty, you cannot give
in to those who wish to...

168
00:10:25,437 --> 00:10:28,366
delete all records that
mention Grand Master Jang.

169
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:32,566
We believe that Grand Master
Jang made a false confession,

170
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:36,156
and beg of you to re-open
the investigation.

171
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:38,196
Please accept our petition.

172
00:10:38,197 --> 00:10:41,766
Your Majesty, you must ask
why Grand Master Jang lied,

173
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,066
and get to the bottom of
whatever plot this is.

174
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:47,596
Your Majesty, you must
find out who framed him,

175
00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:50,567
and hold them responsible for their crimes.

176
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:57,766
Let go.

177
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,297
Let me go!

178
00:10:59,627 --> 00:11:01,026
Let go!

179
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:04,397
You will pay for what you have done!

180
00:11:18,797 --> 00:11:20,397
Your Majesty.

181
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:23,086
Grand Master Jang's issue...

182
00:11:23,087 --> 00:11:26,666
has become an issue of national importance.

183
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:30,266
Before it causes more strife and worry,

184
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:33,027
you should bring an end
to it, Your Majesty.

185
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:36,927
I can say that...

186
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:39,566
I love my people and...

187
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:42,867
listened carefully to everything
each official had to say.

188
00:11:43,597 --> 00:11:45,956
I worked hard to ensure that...

189
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:47,827
Joseon remained peaceful,

190
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:51,197
and did not suffer from
any one man's tyranny.

191
00:11:53,497 --> 00:11:54,997
Despite all that,

192
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:58,797
is it still possible for me
to end up in a situation...

193
00:11:59,727 --> 00:12:02,436
where I must punish...

194
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:04,527
an innocent man?

195
00:12:05,697 --> 00:12:07,197
Your Majesty.

196
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,227
If you let Yeong Sil live,

197
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:14,197
those who oppose you and
him will gather strength.

198
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,997
They may bring upon an
even greater disaster.

199
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:20,666
You cannot risk...

200
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:24,167
your dream of creating a peaceful
and flourishing nation...

201
00:12:24,697 --> 00:12:28,467
just for the sake of one man
however much you cherish him.

202
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:01,867
Dear notebook.

203
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:05,267
You reached the end, just like me.

204
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:13,596
If only I could think of a way
to keep the cogwheels turning...

205
00:13:13,597 --> 00:13:15,097
Wouldn't that be great?

206
00:13:19,127 --> 00:13:21,067
I thought it would be easy.

207
00:13:22,127 --> 00:13:24,267
It's the hardest problem of all.

208
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:28,967
Is it because I'm out of time?

209
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:41,697
You're here.

210
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:50,197
Take this.

211
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:56,326
What is it?

212
00:13:56,327 --> 00:14:00,496
I wrote down and explained
every mechanism behind Okru.

213
00:14:00,497 --> 00:14:01,826
I also wrote...

214
00:14:01,827 --> 00:14:05,566
issues I couldn't solve, or
ideas that I'm sure of...

215
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,067
but was not able to prove.

216
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,027
Even if I die,

217
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:17,227
I would like you to go on
studying those issues.

218
00:14:20,097 --> 00:14:22,666
If you will do that for me,

219
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:24,356
even if I die,

220
00:14:24,357 --> 00:14:27,167
my studies and ideas will remain.

221
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:34,467
If you have the time,

222
00:14:34,827 --> 00:14:37,706
could you stay for a friendly discussion...

223
00:14:37,707 --> 00:14:39,667
of some of the issues?

224
00:14:48,397 --> 00:14:49,897
I can do that.

225
00:14:58,327 --> 00:15:01,167
As you probably can see from what I wrote,

226
00:15:01,697 --> 00:15:05,197
the most important task is to
find a consistent energy source.

227
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:09,326
I have been thinking about
it for a while now,

228
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:11,467
but I haven't yet found a solution.

229
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:13,967
I need you...

230
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:16,467
to find a solution.

231
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:21,596
I was looking at a wind chime
and thought that maybe...

232
00:15:21,597 --> 00:15:23,197
a pendulum that hangs...

233
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,867
Are you looking at the stars?

234
00:15:41,697 --> 00:15:43,216
It's been a while...

235
00:15:43,217 --> 00:15:45,827
since I looked up at the Plough.

236
00:15:47,097 --> 00:15:51,336
The Plough is part of Jamiwon,
which represents the Palace.

237
00:15:51,337 --> 00:15:53,966
It's surrounded by 28 constellations,

238
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:56,227
and Taemiwon that
represents your officials.

239
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:58,876
All those stars...

240
00:15:58,877 --> 00:16:02,667
surround the North Star, which
represents you, Your Majesty.

241
00:16:04,867 --> 00:16:07,497
The North Star shines bright tonight.

242
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:12,526
Your reign and Joseon's future
will be just as bright, I believe.

243
00:16:12,527 --> 00:16:14,027
Do you?

244
00:16:14,897 --> 00:16:16,396
Do you really...

245
00:16:16,397 --> 00:16:18,197
believe so?

246
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:23,067
No, I do not.

247
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:27,756
Then why did you say that?

248
00:16:27,757 --> 00:16:30,227
It is an old story,

249
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:34,296
and I repeated it,

250
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:39,467
hoping that the people would
respect us as they once did.

251
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,327
Yes.

252
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:45,876
The story reminds us that...

253
00:16:45,877 --> 00:16:51,527
whoever is in power lusts for
more and wishes to hold onto it.

254
00:16:52,797 --> 00:16:57,697
They want others to believe
that they were chosen.

255
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:06,086
- Son.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

256
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:08,697
Stars only rise and fall.

257
00:17:09,027 --> 00:17:13,286
Giving them meaning and
using that to govern...

258
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:15,067
is politics.

259
00:17:18,897 --> 00:17:23,527
I am a king who needs the
stars to give me authority.

260
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:29,797
Yeong Sil is a scientist and
scholar who has no need for such.

261
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:37,497
Now...

262
00:17:38,897 --> 00:17:41,197
I should let it go.

263
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:46,427
Yeong Sil is a star.

264
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:50,767
A star I cannot handle.

265
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:55,097
I am a politician.

266
00:17:55,727 --> 00:18:00,167
A politician must punish traitors.

267
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,097
Even though he is innocent.

268
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:05,327
Your Majesty.

269
00:18:11,637 --> 00:18:13,137
Hyang.

270
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:18,106
You must be a better king than I have been.

271
00:18:18,107 --> 00:18:19,827
For Joseon's sake.

272
00:18:22,297 --> 00:18:24,297
I am so sorry.

273
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,126
You are so gentle,

274
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:31,427
and yet I am forcing you into this mayhem.

275
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:39,827
Prince Jinpyeong, promise me
that you will help your brother.

276
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:41,526
I will, Your Majesty.

277
00:18:41,527 --> 00:18:44,527
(Prince Jinpyeong, future King Sejo)

278
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:03,927
The King will announce what he
will do with Jang Yeong Sil.

279
00:19:04,497 --> 00:19:08,467
Don't you think he will reduce
the sentence and destroy...

280
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,796
all records of him just to keep him alive?

281
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:13,327
Most likely.

282
00:19:14,097 --> 00:19:18,297
I can't wait to find out
what the King will say.

283
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:57,967
It took me a great length of
time to reach this decision.

284
00:19:58,527 --> 00:20:02,637
But I have no regrets with
what I am about to say,

285
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:05,137
so I expect you to accept it.

286
00:20:09,227 --> 00:20:13,267
Jang Yeong Sil will be flogged 100 times.

287
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:22,136
To deter anyone from
following in his footsteps,

288
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:25,666
on the day of the flogging,
have him walk through...

289
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:29,497
the town square so he'd be humiliated.

290
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:33,827
All existing records of him
or those that mention him...

291
00:20:34,427 --> 00:20:36,267
will be preserved.

292
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:40,566
Your Majesty, those records...

293
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:45,966
The records that he is a part of are
also records of my past studies.

294
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:51,137
Destroying all mention of him means
destroying my personal records.

295
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,406
Is what I did for the people...

296
00:20:54,407 --> 00:20:59,697
such an embarrassment that they
must be deleted from history?

297
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:02,897
If you cannot answer that,

298
00:21:03,297 --> 00:21:07,026
then you cannot demand I destroy
all records of Jang Yeong Sil.

299
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:08,637
Do you understand?

300
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:13,667
Do not bring this up ever again.

301
00:21:15,227 --> 00:21:16,956
You are dismissed.

302
00:21:16,957 --> 00:21:18,467
Your Majesty.

303
00:21:18,997 --> 00:21:20,816
How dare you.

304
00:21:20,817 --> 00:21:22,767
I dismissed you.

305
00:21:23,997 --> 00:21:28,767
For your insolence, I reduce
the number of floggings to 80.

306
00:21:31,467 --> 00:21:33,397
I dare you to speak up.

307
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:30,827
Walk faster.

308
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:06,927
Walk faster!

309
00:23:09,327 --> 00:23:10,626
Hands off!

310
00:23:10,627 --> 00:23:12,227
Leave him alone.

311
00:23:14,897 --> 00:23:16,497
Get up.

312
00:23:20,227 --> 00:23:22,027
Get back up.

313
00:23:27,097 --> 00:23:30,066
Don't go, Grand Master Jang!

314
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:32,566
- Look after yourself.
- Don't go.

315
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:34,327
Don't go!

316
00:23:34,797 --> 00:23:36,667
Come back.

317
00:23:39,227 --> 00:23:42,427
Don't go, Grand Master Jang!

318
00:23:43,627 --> 00:23:46,827
Don't go, Grand Master!

319
00:23:54,927 --> 00:23:56,556
You know what to do.

320
00:23:56,557 --> 00:24:00,226
50 floggings is enough to
kill any man, let alone this.

321
00:24:00,227 --> 00:24:04,896
If we hit with all our might, his
organs will explode after 30.

322
00:24:04,897 --> 00:24:07,127
His intestines will shred.

323
00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:14,426
- Grand Master Jang, you can't go.
- Please stay.

324
00:24:14,427 --> 00:24:16,797
Don't go, Grand Master.

325
00:24:23,327 --> 00:24:26,467
Do you have to keep hitting him?

326
00:24:32,327 --> 00:24:34,397
- Grand Master.
- Grand Master.

327
00:24:36,897 --> 00:24:38,596
Grand Master Jang.

328
00:24:38,597 --> 00:24:42,246
Now I see why the King made
Jang Yeong Sil walk through...

329
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:47,196
the town square. It's so that
people from all over would see him.

330
00:24:47,197 --> 00:24:52,226
Yes. This is his way of asking
the people to remember him...

331
00:24:52,227 --> 00:24:54,666
and his legacy for years to come.

332
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,316
That's not all.

333
00:24:56,317 --> 00:24:59,727
He's releasing Yeong Sil from
the clutches of politics,

334
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:02,667
which is full of scheming
and back-stabbing,

335
00:25:02,997 --> 00:25:05,997
and into history for the rest of eternity.

336
00:25:07,197 --> 00:25:09,526
He believed that it was best...

337
00:25:09,527 --> 00:25:14,197
for him to let go instead of
keeping Yeong Sil to himself.

338
00:25:16,997 --> 00:25:18,497
Yes.

339
00:25:19,997 --> 00:25:23,197
I can do nothing but let him down,

340
00:25:23,597 --> 00:25:27,946
but one day, our descendants,
years or centuries from now,

341
00:25:27,947 --> 00:25:32,667
will study his legacy and
breathe life into what he left.

342
00:26:03,097 --> 00:26:05,597
Is this the last time I see you?

343
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:08,067
What a pity.

344
00:26:08,897 --> 00:26:10,767
If I die,

345
00:26:11,327 --> 00:26:14,197
take me up with you.

346
00:26:19,197 --> 00:26:21,176
Carry out the execution!

347
00:26:21,177 --> 00:26:22,697
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

348
00:26:25,927 --> 00:26:28,597
You've been victoriously
marching forward so far.

349
00:26:29,267 --> 00:26:30,596
It's time...

350
00:26:30,597 --> 00:26:32,196
you should step back.

351
00:26:32,197 --> 00:26:33,876
Who knows?

352
00:26:33,877 --> 00:26:35,797
You might become even more
famous after you die.

353
00:26:56,297 --> 00:26:58,197
Here comes the first one!

354
00:26:58,897 --> 00:27:00,716
The second one!

355
00:27:00,717 --> 00:27:02,797
The third one.

356
00:27:03,397 --> 00:27:06,366
- The fourth one!
- The fifth one!

357
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:07,796
The sixth one!

358
00:27:07,797 --> 00:27:09,527
The seventh one!

359
00:27:10,597 --> 00:27:11,926
The eighth one!

360
00:27:11,927 --> 00:27:13,726
The ninth one!

361
00:27:13,727 --> 00:27:15,266
The 10th one!

362
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,296
The 11th one!

363
00:27:17,297 --> 00:27:19,596
The 12th one!

364
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,396
The 13th one!

365
00:27:21,397 --> 00:27:23,596
- The 14th one!
- Yeong Sil.

366
00:27:23,597 --> 00:27:25,826
- The 15th one.
- You must survive this.

367
00:27:25,827 --> 00:27:28,466
- The 16th one.
- Yeong Sil, you have to live.

368
00:27:28,467 --> 00:27:30,896
The 17th one.

369
00:27:30,897 --> 00:27:33,426
The 18th one!

370
00:27:33,427 --> 00:27:36,086
The 19th one!

371
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,596
The 20th one!

372
00:27:37,597 --> 00:27:40,127
The 21st one.

373
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:52,986
The 39th one.

374
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:55,896
- The 40th one!
- The 41st one.

375
00:27:55,897 --> 00:27:57,596
The 42nd one.

376
00:27:57,597 --> 00:27:59,496
The 43rd one.

377
00:27:59,497 --> 00:28:01,466
The 44th one.

378
00:28:01,467 --> 00:28:03,427
The 45th one.

379
00:28:32,997 --> 00:28:34,697
Going forward...

380
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:36,867
and taking a step back.

381
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:40,116
Yes.

382
00:28:40,117 --> 00:28:42,266
If I apply this concept to the weight,

383
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:44,327
the weight will swing forward and backward.

384
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:48,167
But the weight will keep moving.

385
00:28:49,397 --> 00:28:51,216
The power that never stops.

386
00:28:51,217 --> 00:28:53,527
A permanent supply of motive
power will be created.

387
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,727
I know the answer now. I
finally figured it out!

388
00:29:00,127 --> 00:29:01,627
This was the answer.

389
00:30:00,197 --> 00:30:03,346
Yeong Sil! Yeong Sil!

390
00:30:03,347 --> 00:30:05,326
Goodness!

391
00:30:05,327 --> 00:30:10,027
Those jerks almost beat
up my friend to death!

392
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:27,797
I don't think he will last over 30 minutes.

393
00:30:39,127 --> 00:30:42,597
He has been unconscious for two days.

394
00:30:43,597 --> 00:30:45,306
The doctor is saying that...

395
00:30:45,307 --> 00:30:47,267
it will be difficult for him to survive.

396
00:31:34,197 --> 00:31:35,697
I'm going to...

397
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:39,427
take Yeong Sil to our hometown.

398
00:31:41,297 --> 00:31:44,597
This land of Joseon took Yeong Sil's life.

399
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:48,897
I'll make sure to hold a
proper funeral for him.

400
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:52,697
All of you noblemen of high standing,

401
00:31:53,727 --> 00:31:56,427
please forget Yeong Sil now.

402
00:32:14,027 --> 00:32:15,527
What?

403
00:32:18,427 --> 00:32:19,927
Goodness!

404
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,897
Yeong Sil!

405
00:32:23,297 --> 00:32:25,496
Yeong Sil! Yeong Sil!

406
00:32:25,497 --> 00:32:27,626
Yeong Sil! Yeong Sil is alive!

407
00:32:27,627 --> 00:32:29,496
Yeong Sil is alive!

408
00:32:29,497 --> 00:32:31,326
Look! Yeong Sil is alive!

409
00:32:31,327 --> 00:32:32,767
Yeong... Yeong Sil.

410
00:32:37,297 --> 00:32:38,797
Yeong Sil.

411
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:42,826
Yeong... Yeong Sil. Yeong Sil!

412
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,566
It's... It's me.

413
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:46,166
It's me, Suk Gu.

414
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:47,667
Suk Gu.

415
00:32:55,897 --> 00:32:57,397
Yeong Sil.

416
00:32:58,127 --> 00:32:59,627
Yeong Sil, what's the matter?

417
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:02,267
What's wrong, Yeong Sil?

418
00:33:03,097 --> 00:33:04,597
Grand Master.

419
00:33:45,127 --> 00:33:49,226
(I'm deeply concerned with
the Crown Prince's illness.)

420
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:55,297
(I'd like to grant an amnesty for
all prisoners charged with theft.)

421
00:34:07,427 --> 00:34:08,967
Yeong Sil.

422
00:34:09,727 --> 00:34:11,267
Now,

423
00:34:11,797 --> 00:34:13,466
I know why you wanted to...

424
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:15,646
include the people as well as...

425
00:34:15,647 --> 00:34:19,467
those cute figurines in your Okru.

426
00:34:21,367 --> 00:34:23,497
You wanted there to be
a sense of affection.

427
00:34:24,537 --> 00:34:26,267
Science and affection.

428
00:34:27,127 --> 00:34:29,967
It is a union of the
humanities and sciences.

429
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:33,896
Thanks to your wisdom, I was able to...

430
00:34:33,897 --> 00:34:37,097
feel the extensiveness of
this world through your Okru.

431
00:34:39,267 --> 00:34:41,006
I still trust that...

432
00:34:41,007 --> 00:34:44,727
your clock and my alphabet
are holding hands,

433
00:34:45,037 --> 00:34:48,997
overcoming and conquering
all the obstacles together.

434
00:34:51,427 --> 00:34:53,067
But that doesn't take...

435
00:34:53,797 --> 00:34:55,327
my sadness away.

436
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:57,497
I am deeply saddened.

437
00:35:01,037 --> 00:35:03,997
Have I achieved everything
I wanted to accomplish...

438
00:35:05,397 --> 00:35:08,267
before my last day in this world?

439
00:35:19,127 --> 00:35:24,067
King Sejong died in 1450.

440
00:35:25,097 --> 00:35:30,346
Through effectively governing
all aspects of the kingdom,

441
00:35:30,347 --> 00:35:35,267
King Sejong allowed Joseon to enjoy
a reign of peace for 30 years.

442
00:35:36,497 --> 00:35:40,196
By creating Joseon's own
alphabet and almanacs,

443
00:35:40,197 --> 00:35:43,497
he made the people's live
become more prosperous.

444
00:35:44,127 --> 00:35:46,746
The people of his time called this era...

445
00:35:46,747 --> 00:35:49,967
the Yao and Shun Era of the East.

446
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:04,066
Lee Chun...

447
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:06,366
directed the development of
tools and equipment such as...

448
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:11,236
cannons, metal types and various
astronomical devices...

449
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:15,497
and helped King Sejong's golden
age of science flourish.

450
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:18,796
Also, he became the military
commander of Pyongan Province...

451
00:36:18,797 --> 00:36:22,167
and strengthened military
defence of the northern border.

452
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:25,496
Lee Chun was an outstanding scholar...

453
00:36:25,497 --> 00:36:28,997
as well as a distinguished
military official.

454
00:36:29,397 --> 00:36:33,827
This multitalented man died in 1451.

455
00:36:42,697 --> 00:36:45,627
The former King passed away,

456
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:51,037
and even Lee Chun died, but I
am still here in the court.

457
00:36:51,797 --> 00:36:53,716
I once told Lee Chun that...

458
00:36:53,717 --> 00:36:59,127
my wish is to live two more
years than the former King.

459
00:37:00,197 --> 00:37:05,697
I guess the skies are really
going to grant my wish.

460
00:37:07,797 --> 00:37:10,506
Well, why are you blaming the skies?

461
00:37:10,507 --> 00:37:12,597
Living a long life is a blessing.

462
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:16,897
I'm worried.

463
00:37:17,997 --> 00:37:21,446
The King isn't very healthy at the moment,

464
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,597
and the Crown Prince is so young.

465
00:37:25,097 --> 00:37:29,797
I am concerned that Prince
Suyang might do something.

466
00:37:31,227 --> 00:37:35,897
If something like that happens,
I will not let it slide.

467
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:43,427
The times when we used to
discuss political matters...

468
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:47,997
with Meng Sa Sung and
Heo Jo were good days.

469
00:37:50,327 --> 00:37:56,267
What will happen to the court and
to this kingdom from now on?

470
00:37:57,427 --> 00:37:59,297
I am truly concerned.

471
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:03,967
Stop worrying about things
that you have no answers to.

472
00:38:04,537 --> 00:38:07,167
Let's go home now.

473
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:12,727
The year 1452.

474
00:38:13,497 --> 00:38:16,536
Hwang Hui, the longest-serving
prime minister of Joseon,

475
00:38:16,537 --> 00:38:22,197
who served as the First Vice Prime
Minister for 24 years, died.

476
00:38:23,537 --> 00:38:27,596
He served and assisted
four kings of Joseon,

477
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:31,197
King Taejo, King Taejong,
King Sejong and King Munjong.

478
00:38:34,427 --> 00:38:40,167
Ha Yeon died in 1452, the second
year of King Danjong's reign.

479
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:45,697
Because he strictly followed the law
and code of conduct until he died,

480
00:38:46,067 --> 00:38:49,767
Ha Yeon was known as the prime
minister who brought peace.

481
00:38:50,997 --> 00:38:54,297
(The year 1456: The second
year of King Sejo's reign)

482
00:39:02,537 --> 00:39:04,597
Many members of the nobility...

483
00:39:05,697 --> 00:39:09,796
have no idea how little they know.

484
00:39:09,797 --> 00:39:12,866
Acting as if they know everything.

485
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:14,096
(King Sejo: The seventh king of Joseon)

486
00:39:14,097 --> 00:39:16,167
They constantly fight over
insubstantial matters...

487
00:39:17,067 --> 00:39:22,267
insisting that only what
they think is right.

488
00:39:24,397 --> 00:39:28,367
Tell me. What are your thoughts on this?

489
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,967
Yes, Your Majesty.

490
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:36,296
Studying is one path to finding the truth.

491
00:39:36,297 --> 00:39:39,327
I do not think that it
is the absolute path.

492
00:39:40,197 --> 00:39:45,466
Those with short-sighted minds
who pursue such studies...

493
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:50,496
have a tight grip on power and are
doing whatever they can to keep it.

494
00:39:50,497 --> 00:39:55,967
What's more? They are even trying
to make me become their puppet.

495
00:39:59,427 --> 00:40:04,927
How could I let them get away
with what they are doing?

496
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:08,267
For a brighter future of Joseon,

497
00:40:10,097 --> 00:40:13,597
we must kill them all.

498
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:19,167
Understood, Your Majesty.

499
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:26,267
I will proceed as per your order.

500
00:40:40,267 --> 00:40:41,976
Keep going.

501
00:40:41,977 --> 00:40:43,617
- Yes, Your Majesty!
- Yes, Your Majesty!

502
00:40:47,997 --> 00:40:50,696
Prince Suyang, the younger
brother of King Munjong,

503
00:40:50,697 --> 00:40:53,296
usurped the throne from King Danjong...

504
00:40:53,297 --> 00:40:56,497
and became the seventh
King of Joseon, King Sejo.

505
00:40:57,397 --> 00:40:59,796
Making the government agencies...

506
00:40:59,797 --> 00:41:02,516
directly seek and receive his approval,

507
00:41:02,517 --> 00:41:04,696
King Sejo carried out polices
to centralise the government...

508
00:41:04,697 --> 00:41:07,627
and strengthened the royal authority.

509
00:41:16,467 --> 00:41:19,067
You can do it, everyone. Yes, keep going.

510
00:41:20,567 --> 00:41:24,256
They're valuable objects. You
have to be gentle with them.

511
00:41:24,257 --> 00:41:26,596
Of course, we'll be careful.

512
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:28,097
Yes, carry it like that.

513
00:41:28,427 --> 00:41:30,497
You can do it. Keep going, okay?

514
00:41:31,997 --> 00:41:34,297
Be careful. Yes, you're doing a good job.

515
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:37,596
- Father.
- Yes.

516
00:41:37,597 --> 00:41:40,196
- They're all organised now.
- Great, thanks.

517
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:41,697
You've done a great job.

518
00:41:42,537 --> 00:41:44,427
The Palace has become such a corrupt place,

519
00:41:44,797 --> 00:41:46,566
and Yeong Sil turned out like that.

520
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:49,666
In my opinion, you're the most
successful one out of all of us.

521
00:41:49,667 --> 00:41:53,127
That is exactly why I tell my kids this.

522
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:58,197
"The most important thing
is to yield profit."

523
00:41:58,627 --> 00:42:01,066
"Make as much profit as possible
and use it towards good deeds."

524
00:42:01,067 --> 00:42:05,697
What good does becoming a
king or a science do anyway?

525
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:08,897
You're the most enlightened one, indeed.

526
00:42:09,297 --> 00:42:12,997
But how would having one enlightened
person help this land of Joseon?

527
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:17,436
I recently visited the Middle East.

528
00:42:17,437 --> 00:42:20,127
Those countries have become so
advanced that I was utterly shocked.

529
00:42:21,197 --> 00:42:23,386
Then I visited Ming on my way back home,

530
00:42:23,387 --> 00:42:25,197
and they're just as pathetic as us.

531
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:27,976
Things in Joseon are so
pitiful and pathetic now.

532
00:42:27,977 --> 00:42:31,026
All talented men are just obsessed
with the civil service examination.

533
00:42:31,027 --> 00:42:32,896
All they want to do is to
become civil officials.

534
00:42:32,897 --> 00:42:36,227
No one has even an ounce
of interest in science.

535
00:42:36,697 --> 00:42:38,627
Will this kingdom be okay?

536
00:42:39,127 --> 00:42:40,697
This kingdom of Joseon.

537
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:45,546
You fool. Why are you saying
that Joseon is pathetic?

538
00:42:45,547 --> 00:42:49,826
Joseon, the land of scholars,
will last for a very long time.

539
00:42:49,827 --> 00:42:54,196
This nation where bookworms gain
all the power will last for long?

540
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:57,456
That's right. That's why this
world is an unpredictable place.

541
00:42:57,457 --> 00:43:00,196
As hundreds of years pass by slowly,

542
00:43:00,197 --> 00:43:03,267
this world will transform into
a totally difference place.

543
00:43:04,097 --> 00:43:06,667
I agree with Sir Choi.

544
00:43:07,397 --> 00:43:09,037
Hello.

545
00:43:11,927 --> 00:43:14,427
Your... Your Majesty!

546
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:35,997
Grand Master.

547
00:43:37,127 --> 00:43:39,086
I held my first solar eclipse ceremony...

548
00:43:39,087 --> 00:43:42,767
for the solar eclipse that
took place last month.

549
00:43:44,067 --> 00:43:46,786
I can take it as a sign that...

550
00:43:46,787 --> 00:43:49,167
the skies have forgiven
and accepted me, right?

551
00:43:51,027 --> 00:43:54,596
Now that I have become a
king, I have to bestow...

552
00:43:54,597 --> 00:43:57,627
meaning of danger upon the stars
and use them to rule this kingdom.

553
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:02,427
However, shouldn't someone...

554
00:44:03,627 --> 00:44:06,306
remove that distorted cloud of danger...

555
00:44:06,307 --> 00:44:09,327
and reveal the truth about the stars?

556
00:44:12,197 --> 00:44:14,066
Grand Master.

557
00:44:14,067 --> 00:44:17,966
All those members of the nobility
who made your life painful.

558
00:44:17,967 --> 00:44:21,886
I taught them all a serious lesson.

559
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:25,697
Hence, you must wake up now.

560
00:44:29,497 --> 00:44:32,867
I will make sure that
my Joseon flourishes...

561
00:44:33,267 --> 00:44:35,567
even more than King Sejong's era.

562
00:44:36,067 --> 00:44:39,297
Grand Master, I heard that you
said this to King Taejong.

563
00:44:39,697 --> 00:44:41,716
The wind that was blowing
in this land of Joseon...

564
00:44:41,717 --> 00:44:45,867
made you stay here when you
were about to leave for Ming.

565
00:44:46,627 --> 00:44:51,097
Can't you feel the strong wind of
change blowing on this land now?

566
00:44:51,827 --> 00:44:54,796
Wake up now and help me, please!

567
00:44:54,797 --> 00:44:56,297
Please!

568
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:31,397
Grand Master.

569
00:45:32,727 --> 00:45:34,567
I see that you're dreaming.

570
00:45:42,327 --> 00:45:46,167
I know well because I've seen many
people just before their deaths.

571
00:45:46,527 --> 00:45:49,897
I know when they feel worried or agonised.

572
00:45:51,697 --> 00:45:55,767
But Grand Master Jang is
content at the moment.

573
00:45:57,397 --> 00:45:59,416
The skies have given him a blessing...

574
00:45:59,417 --> 00:46:02,597
so that he could leave this
crazy world for a while...

575
00:46:03,167 --> 00:46:05,997
and be locked up in his dreams.

576
00:46:19,197 --> 00:46:20,966
You said that...

577
00:46:20,967 --> 00:46:23,927
you'd like to stay here when
you leave Hanyang if possible.

578
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:25,867
Yes, Your Majesty.

579
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:28,876
Grand Master.

580
00:46:28,877 --> 00:46:31,327
Please wake up for Princess So Hyun.

581
00:46:31,667 --> 00:46:34,567
You can stop dreaming now.

582
00:46:35,867 --> 00:46:37,596
And...

583
00:46:37,597 --> 00:46:39,527
I just want him to wake up.

584
00:46:42,027 --> 00:46:44,427
He doesn't need to come
to me when he wakes up.

585
00:46:50,397 --> 00:46:52,567
Stay well.

586
00:47:01,797 --> 00:47:03,297
I will visit you again soon.

587
00:47:08,467 --> 00:47:09,967
Please...

588
00:47:10,367 --> 00:47:12,067
call my name then.

589
00:47:58,627 --> 00:48:00,127
It's all done!

590
00:48:00,697 --> 00:48:03,367
Grand Master, the simplified
armilla you made.

591
00:48:04,227 --> 00:48:07,227
Now, Suk Gu's son can make it, too.

592
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:09,516
Your Highness.

593
00:48:09,517 --> 00:48:12,666
Where does my son get his talents from?

594
00:48:12,667 --> 00:48:14,727
I guess I take after Yeong Sil?

595
00:48:19,767 --> 00:48:21,266
- Son.
- Yes.

596
00:48:21,267 --> 00:48:24,497
You know that studying the stars
has to remain as a hobby, right?

597
00:48:25,097 --> 00:48:27,496
Good. Let's leave now.

598
00:48:27,497 --> 00:48:30,266
We need to arrive in
Yangju before the sunrise.

599
00:48:30,267 --> 00:48:31,666
Okay.

600
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:33,446
Well, Your Highness.

601
00:48:33,447 --> 00:48:34,766
I made sure that your room is warm.

602
00:48:34,767 --> 00:48:36,826
You shouldn't catch a cold,

603
00:48:36,827 --> 00:48:38,267
so please go inside now.

604
00:49:07,797 --> 00:49:09,667
Today, Venus is at...

605
00:49:10,467 --> 00:49:14,197
the exact same location as the time
we observed it at the observatory.

606
00:49:17,727 --> 00:49:19,367
Grand Master, I thought that...

607
00:49:20,527 --> 00:49:24,297
Venus would keep the two of us connected.

608
00:49:25,267 --> 00:49:27,067
Unfortunately, it couldn't.

609
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:32,167
Sometimes,

610
00:49:33,097 --> 00:49:35,727
I regretted and thought that...

611
00:49:37,027 --> 00:49:39,567
I should have just abandoned
all I had and run to you.

612
00:49:42,497 --> 00:49:43,997
Grand Master.

613
00:49:45,527 --> 00:49:47,727
I do not know when it will be,

614
00:49:49,267 --> 00:49:51,467
but I will wait for the
day that you will...

615
00:49:51,927 --> 00:49:53,797
welcome me with open arms.

616
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:07,497
Grand Master Jang.

617
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,027
Your Highness.

618
00:50:15,897 --> 00:50:17,467
Grand Master.

619
00:50:19,097 --> 00:50:20,597
When did you...

620
00:50:21,467 --> 00:50:23,597
When did you wake up?

621
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,727
Well...

622
00:50:26,827 --> 00:50:31,166
I heard you saying, "I
should have run to you."

623
00:50:31,167 --> 00:50:33,397
I heard those words.

624
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:37,967
Thank you.

625
00:50:40,327 --> 00:50:42,867
Thank you so much for
coming back like this.

626
00:50:45,427 --> 00:50:47,727
It is so good to see you
again, Your Highness.

627
00:50:51,697 --> 00:50:53,367
Where is Lord Lee Chun?

628
00:50:54,397 --> 00:50:56,167
He didn't come with you?

629
00:50:58,997 --> 00:51:00,627
What about His Majesty?

630
00:51:12,597 --> 00:51:14,127
I...

631
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:18,367
I guess I have been dreaming for too long.

632
00:51:18,997 --> 00:51:20,667
His Majesty...

633
00:51:21,467 --> 00:51:23,367
visited you here...

634
00:51:24,397 --> 00:51:26,856
before he passed away.

635
00:51:26,857 --> 00:51:28,367
I came with him then.

636
00:51:32,497 --> 00:51:34,176
To be honest,

637
00:51:34,177 --> 00:51:35,997
I came here secretly.

638
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:39,466
I want to leave the throne,

639
00:51:39,467 --> 00:51:42,616
but the members of the
nobility wouldn't let me.

640
00:51:42,617 --> 00:51:46,567
I'm so exhausted, but they won't let me go.

641
00:51:49,027 --> 00:51:52,796
Coming here with the Royal
Secretary to see you...

642
00:51:52,797 --> 00:51:55,046
is making me reminisce the old days.

643
00:51:55,047 --> 00:51:56,867
I am truly happy to see you.

644
00:52:00,797 --> 00:52:02,527
Yeong Sil.

645
00:52:04,467 --> 00:52:06,197
Thank you.

646
00:52:09,367 --> 00:52:12,267
If I were a commoner, I
would have said this.

647
00:52:16,497 --> 00:52:18,167
Yeong Sil.

648
00:52:20,367 --> 00:52:22,046
Thanks so much.

649
00:52:22,047 --> 00:52:23,967
Thanks for all of your help.

650
00:52:24,797 --> 00:52:26,427
What has the Palace done...

651
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:30,467
to be given the honour to serve
such a special guest like you?

652
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:35,806
I would have carried you on my back...

653
00:52:35,807 --> 00:52:38,067
and be so excited about our friendship.

654
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:51,027
This is all I can do to let you know
how thankful I am for all you did.

655
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:53,767
I am sorry.

656
00:52:57,797 --> 00:52:59,297
I know that Yeong Sil...

657
00:53:00,097 --> 00:53:02,097
feels everything you're feeling now.

658
00:53:02,567 --> 00:53:05,797
I know him very well.

659
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:08,067
I have a feeling that...

660
00:53:09,567 --> 00:53:11,127
today might be...

661
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:15,367
the last day I could see you.

662
00:53:17,267 --> 00:53:18,767
Please...

663
00:53:19,967 --> 00:53:22,527
only have good dreams.

664
00:53:40,497 --> 00:53:42,967
What will you do from now on?

665
00:53:43,397 --> 00:53:45,267
You're an old man now.

666
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,897
Right.

667
00:53:50,097 --> 00:53:53,467
Well, I should make a clock first.

668
00:53:55,767 --> 00:53:57,267
That's right, a clock.

669
00:54:00,967 --> 00:54:02,767
It's coming back to me now.

670
00:54:03,197 --> 00:54:04,697
What is?

671
00:54:05,267 --> 00:54:07,297
A self-operating clock.

672
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,527
Motive power.

673
00:54:12,797 --> 00:54:14,297
What was it...

674
00:54:22,067 --> 00:54:24,767
Darn it, I forgot.

675
00:54:25,997 --> 00:54:28,497
Gosh, I'm such an idiot.

676
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:31,867
You can try again.

677
00:54:32,997 --> 00:54:35,367
You can start again from the beginning.

678
00:54:37,097 --> 00:54:38,727
I'll help you.

679
00:54:39,427 --> 00:54:41,467
We should use this simplified armilla...

680
00:54:42,067 --> 00:54:43,697
to observe the movements of...

681
00:54:44,267 --> 00:54:47,867
the sun, the moon and the
five planets every day...

682
00:54:48,797 --> 00:54:50,367
and forecast astronomical events.

683
00:54:51,927 --> 00:54:53,467
You're right.

684
00:54:54,527 --> 00:54:56,167
Your Highness, with your help,

685
00:54:56,567 --> 00:54:59,367
I can start over from the beginning.

686
00:55:49,967 --> 00:55:52,046
That's great.

687
00:55:52,047 --> 00:55:54,027
You're doing very well.

688
00:55:55,427 --> 00:55:56,967
Yes.

689
00:55:57,667 --> 00:55:59,866
Don't leave room for any regret.

690
00:55:59,867 --> 00:56:03,627
Swallow it. Engulf it all.

691
00:56:04,297 --> 00:56:08,496
The advancement of science,
which enabled Korea to prosper,

692
00:56:08,497 --> 00:56:11,467
did not happen overnight.

693
00:56:12,897 --> 00:56:15,326
According to "The Encyclopaedia of
History of Science and Technology",

694
00:56:15,327 --> 00:56:18,327
which examines the world's history
of science and technology,

695
00:56:18,867 --> 00:56:22,626
there were 80 achievements made
in the realm of science and...

696
00:56:22,627 --> 00:56:24,627
technology all over the
world in the 15th century.

697
00:56:24,927 --> 00:56:29,367
Among them, 34 achievements
were made in Joseon.

698
00:56:29,727 --> 00:56:31,666
China had five achievements,

699
00:56:31,667 --> 00:56:33,897
and so did Japan.

700
00:56:34,297 --> 00:56:38,826
All other countries in the
world, except for these three,

701
00:56:38,827 --> 00:56:41,166
together made 36 achievements in total.

702
00:56:41,167 --> 00:56:42,826
In 15th century,

703
00:56:42,827 --> 00:56:47,297
the country with the most advanced
scientific technologies was Joseon.

704
00:56:47,897 --> 00:56:54,006
We'd like to dedicate this
drama, Jang Yeong Sil, to...

705
00:56:54,007 --> 00:56:57,867
Jang Yeong Sil as well as countless
unknown scientists of Joseon.

706
00:57:17,027 --> 00:57:20,667
(Jang Yeong Sil)

707
00:58:08,627 --> 00:58:11,697
(Thank you for watching Jang Yeong Sil.)

708
00:58:14,727 --> 00:58:16,096
(Jang Yeong Sil: Joseon's
scientist and inventor...)

709
00:58:16,097 --> 00:58:17,296
(who invented various scientific devices.)

710
00:58:17,297 --> 00:58:20,467
The greatest scientist of
Joseon, Jang Yeong Sil.

711
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:25,466
There is a meaningful place for him
inside the Gyeongbokgung Palace.

712
00:58:25,467 --> 00:58:26,626
(Gangnyeongjeon: The king's
main residing quarters)

713
00:58:26,627 --> 00:58:30,427
It is near Gangnyeongjeon, which has
the king's main residing chamber.

714
00:58:31,467 --> 00:58:36,666
King Sejong never stopped working
even when he was resting here.

715
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:41,167
He used to frequent this pavilion
which is just outside the fence.

716
00:58:42,497 --> 00:58:43,826
It is called Heumgyeonggak.

717
00:58:43,827 --> 00:58:46,396
(Heumgyeonggak: A pavilion built
as an observatory in 1438)

718
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:49,666
Built for astronomical research
and observations by King Sejong,

719
00:58:49,667 --> 00:58:54,366
it's said to have housed Jang Yeong
Sil's automatic water clock, Okru.

720
00:58:54,367 --> 00:58:56,366
(Various astronomical devices
were installed in Heumgyeonggak.)

721
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:59,026
(The current building was restored
from the one that was rebuilt...)

722
00:58:59,027 --> 00:59:02,067
(during Heungseon Daewongun's time.)

723
00:59:03,067 --> 00:59:07,026
King Sejong discussed matters
about astronomical research...

724
00:59:07,027 --> 00:59:09,766
and exchanged opinions with Jang
Yeong Sil and other scientists here.

725
00:59:09,767 --> 00:59:10,826
(Armillary sphere: A celestial
observation device)

726
00:59:10,827 --> 00:59:15,226
The centre of the world King Sejong
and Jang Yeong Sil wanted to...

727
00:59:15,227 --> 00:59:17,227
create through science was the people.

728
00:59:18,027 --> 00:59:21,496
To achieve that goal, they
deciphered the messages...

729
00:59:21,497 --> 00:59:24,896
from the sun and the stars and
established the standards of time.

730
00:59:24,897 --> 00:59:26,366
(Jagyeokru: A self-striking water clock)

731
00:59:26,367 --> 00:59:29,326
Among all of their achievements,
the completion of Jagyeokru,

732
00:59:29,327 --> 00:59:32,326
which is a highly-advanced and
accurate self-striking clock,

733
00:59:32,327 --> 00:59:36,767
is recognised as the most important
incident in the history of clocks.

734
00:59:39,397 --> 00:59:40,926
Jang Yeong Sil.

735
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,966
His achievements have
stood the test of time,

736
00:59:42,967 --> 00:59:48,167
and he dedicated his whole
life for the people of Joseon.
