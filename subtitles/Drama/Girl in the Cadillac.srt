1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,200
Midnight's girl

2
00:00:21,794 --> 00:00:23,361
Sera is not there..

3
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:38,160
The person you are calling is not available. Please leave a 
message after the tone. Extra charges may...

4
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,850
It's probably broken or something...

5
00:00:57,062 --> 00:00:58,162
What is this?

6
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:01,587
Let's close down the karaoke.

7
00:01:01,588 --> 00:01:02,688
Why?

8
00:01:02,712 --> 00:01:04,212
Aigoo!

9
00:01:06,857 --> 00:01:10,924
Hyung, do we have to turn this place into a storage?

10
00:01:10,926 --> 00:01:12,626
What kind of crap are you saying?

11
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,650
If you regret it so much, then you sell it for me.

12
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,674
Why? Do you feel attached to it?

13
00:01:16,698 --> 00:01:20,198
I have a lot to organize. Quick, put those chairs up.

14
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,409
Mr. President!

15
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:30,033
Are you closing down?

16
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:32,905
Yeah, well... it seems so.

17
00:01:33,847 --> 00:01:35,147
I'll buy it.

18
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,590
Really?

19
00:01:39,614 --> 00:01:41,914
It seems like there were customers 
from time to time during night.

20
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:52,238
Mr. President, then let's go outside and talk more about this in depth.

21
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:53,638
Sure.

22
00:01:53,638 --> 00:01:55,438
Closing down? Nonsense.

23
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,362
You, don't leave! Wait for me, wait!

24
00:02:03,386 --> 00:02:05,386
Closing down? What did you mean?

25
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,110

This is my daughter, Sera.

37
00:03:38,597 --> 00:03:43,497
She has just been lying like this because of a car accident.

38
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:46,123
I've waited 4 years.

39
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:53,043
It's Sera's handphone.

40
00:03:54,772 --> 00:03:59,539
Its battery should have been drained,

41
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,159
but maybe there was a little left

42
00:04:02,183 --> 00:04:04,183
when I received the call from you.

43
00:04:05,907 --> 00:04:10,307
The first person to call us in four years...

44
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:14,883

45

00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:23,722
Ta da!

59
00:05:29,748 --> 00:05:32,315
Are you doing magic for the talent show?

60
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,010
No, it's a club. Magic club.

61
00:05:36,193 --> 00:05:38,860
Oh, there's such a thing? Freshman?

62
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,338
Yes.

63
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:46,148
But, a flower is too cliche so why don't you try something else?

64
00:05:47,772 --> 00:05:50,072
Here, I picked this out from a toy coin machine.

65
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,719
A dolphin instead of a flowers.

66
00:06:03,703 --> 00:06:07,336
Ah, the truth is I'm singing as the 12th grade representative tomorrow.

67
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,160
So, I was here to practice...

68
00:06:09,184 --> 00:06:13,684
Can I watch you practice, Jidan oppa?

69
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,208
How do you know my name?

70
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:18,665
Ahh..

71
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:21,414
I didn't know because of that...

72
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,733
I'm your fan.

73
00:06:24,757 --> 00:06:26,057
Ah, really?

74
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:28,681
Yes, since very long time ago.

75
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:30,605
Really?

76
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:35,929
Hey, Handsome! What are you doing here?

77
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:40,330
All the girls from other high schools rushed here to hear you sing.

78
00:06:40,354 --> 00:06:42,354
Come on! Hurry, Hurry!

79
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:43,878
I've to go.

80
00:06:53,802 --> 00:06:58,269
Jidan oppa, you will be a very good singer.

81
00:07:02,082 --> 00:07:04,249
Sera always said...

82
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:06,846
..to wait and see.

83
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,863
That, you will be a good singer.

84
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:15,935
I also wished that you would become a good singer

85
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:20,559
so, that Sera would be able to see you on TV

86
00:07:22,773 --> 00:07:25,273
But you came so soon.

87
00:07:28,207 --> 00:07:32,807
It's just, there's someone I want to help.

88
00:07:36,094 --> 00:07:40,161
The person she want to help...was me.

89
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:41,275
Sing once!

90
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:47,905
I'm sure there is at least one person in this world who is waiting for Gong Ji Dan's song.

91
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:51,529
That person can be close or far away.

92
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:54,664
So she came to me...

93
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:56,688
...and left

94
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:02,022
In that blind moment, when I sleep.

95
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:09,556
I'm just finally starting to get to know you..

96
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:15,204

108
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,020

Ouhh, my Gong Ji Dan

117
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,500
You're still rolling around on bed, aren't you?

118
00:11:24,524 --> 00:11:26,324
Ah, what is it?

119
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:29,025
I'll give you one hour.
Hurry up and come outside. Go~

120
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,030
Hello? Hyung?

Aish!

Oh! Hey! I'm going to Maldives tomorrow!

123
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:40,946

124
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,525
Hey, is my son an average son?

125
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:49,349

Ah, busy busy!
-Oppa!

129
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,983
What is it?
- Of course I'm busy~

130

133
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:19,046
Please hurry up! You're going to be late!

134
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:20,648
What with this car?

135
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:23,949
Ha! I give up on the moneylending business and get one!

136
00:12:23,973 --> 00:12:27,973
This should be enough to serve our superstar!

137
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:32,897
I'm not a star yet. I'm gonna ride the subway.
Stop overreacting, please!

138
00:12:33,121 --> 00:12:35,121
Hey! Hey!

139
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:37,345
Hey, don't be late and be here by 2!

00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:41,399
He left.

141
00:13:03,943 --> 00:13:09,643
I heard that dolphins can communicate with each other 
even if they're thousands of kilometers away from each other.

142
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:13,467
Thousands of kilometers...No, more than that.

143
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:15,491
Sending what your heart feels.

144
00:13:18,288 --> 00:13:27,588
Even if we're far away, my mind and feelings, 
can I really send them on to where you're?

145
00:13:29,712 --> 00:13:31,612
Of course!

146
00:13:33,836 --> 00:13:36,836
Talking to myself making me even hear things.

147
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,645
