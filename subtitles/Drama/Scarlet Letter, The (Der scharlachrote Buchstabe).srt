the fruit of tree was good for food

00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,754
And pleasing to the eye and also
desirable for gaining wisdom

6
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,256
she took some and ate it.
she has offered her husband.

7
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:50,055
With some fruit and
he ate it as well

8
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,283
Temptations are fun

9
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,246
You have no idea
what fun they can be

10
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:21,131
They always begin
like games

11
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,970
Why avoid them?

00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:14,995
Shut up for 8 seconds

20
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,250
You know what Pace means?

21
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,416
Peace! Huh?

22
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,714
God, give us peace!

23
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,437
Dead with a smashed head?

24
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,812
That's no peaceful way to die

25
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,235
Are you in peace?

26
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,734
Wow, On this great day huh?

27
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,533
Think I'm in peace on my way
to see a smashed head?

28
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,578
By the same token

29
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:07,832
whoever smashed his head
wouldn't be in peace either

30
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,925

- Captain

32
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,088
Found any clues?

33
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,635
- Good morning Captain.
- Hey

34
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,411
- Captain
- Huh?

35
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,789
- Its this way
- Okay

36
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:50,100
It's only been a few hours

37
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,274
The body is still stiff

38
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,742
A murder weapon?

39
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,207
Something hard like a brick

40
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,085
- Did you look for it?
- It's gone

41
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,547
- You sure?
- Sir?

42
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,876
- When I got..
- Take a note

43
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:17,837
Okay

44
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:22,216
'A murder weapon rarely
leaves the crime scene.'

45
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,596
I will find some uniforms
to search the area

46
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,974
Tell them to pay extra attention
to trashcans and manholes

47
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,902
AH N, who found the body?

48
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,276
His wife

49
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,437
Should I sit there?

50
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:16,027
Did you kill your husband?

51
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,447
Taking the fifth won't
do you any good

52
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,323
When I got back

53
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,044
I found him on the floor

54
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,834
- Where did you go?
- The market

55
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,297
What did you buy?

56
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,681
Didn't you go to the market...

57
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,641
to buy things?

58
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:52,102
- Some bean sprouts.
- For how much?

59
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,522
- 2 dollars.
- You have a lover, don't you?

60
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,816
Were you cheating on him?

61
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,070
Never

62
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,948
You have a criminal record

63
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:12,702
March 1999, at the mall...

64
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,374
I tried on a pair of shoes

65
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:19,167
and I forgot to pay

66
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,299
I was gonna Pa)'

67
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,715
But they didn't trust me

68
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,183
A cup of coffee?

69
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,963
Shit

70
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,079
That's enough

71
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,040
Come sit

72
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,829
I'm out of aftershave

73
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,462
- Already?
- Yeah

74
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:12,008
You use it for body oil, or what?

75
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:19,140
Damn, the deposit rate has
dropped again

76
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,426
- Here.
- Thanks

77
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,475
The doctor's appointment is
at 2 today, right?

78
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,602
- It's tomorrow.
-huh?

79
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,612
Wait. Come here

80
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,610
Hold still

81
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,492
Let me listen to my son

82
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,624
Puﬂe He was our patron.
A fine gentlemen

83
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,713
Any domestic problems?

84
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,959
Did they have issues?

85
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,211
They seemed fine

86
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,712
He was loaded...

87
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,056
and wasn't a womanizer

88
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:04,936
They didn't have a child.
Then again...

89
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:10,521
A little bird told me
he wasn't shooting blanks

90
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,768
What do you mean?

91
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,443
She got so many abortions

92
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,282
behind his back

93
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,026
That's what I heard

94
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,786
Yeon- shim?

95
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,248
She's so clumsy!

96
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,039
Get these gentlemen
some snacks

97
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,668
She bought bean sprouts
around 4 yesterday

98
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,165
- Do you remember?
- Think hard

99
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,963
- I can't
- She bought them from you

100
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,552
- Can't you remember?
- I don't remember anything

101
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,296
- Leave me alone.
- AHN!

102
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,139
- AHN, that's enough.
- Go away!

103
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,145
Recoil

104
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,057
Recoil spring

105
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,853
Magazine, End, slide... Check!

106
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,943
21 seconds
shit!

107
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,452
What's the point?
We hardly use it

108
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,620
CHO

109
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,620
you know what lured me
into the police academy?

110
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,500
This! huh?

111
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,128
Sig Sauer P- 226

112
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,013
This was what

113
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,726
They sell these at the marts
in America though

114
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,226
- Checked the insurance?
- Yes

115
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,990
He bought a policy recently

116
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,735
- Life policy?
- Yes, for half a million

117
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,739
- The beneficiary is his wife?
- Bingo!

118
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,370
This is almost too easy

119
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,744
It's so obvious

120
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,048
Take a note

121
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,093
'They never smash heads

122
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,680
like that just for money.'

123
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,673
These days...

124
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,931
they cut fingers off
for a few hundred bucks

125
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,765
- Aren't you writing it down?
- Sure

126
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,808
What about the wife?

127
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,646
She helped her husband
with the studio

128
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,399
She must be seeing someone.
Check into it

129
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,277
Put one of our men on her

130
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,029
AHN is out there

131
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,039
Get your ass out too!

132
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,326
Listen to the baby's heartbeat

133
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,506
Head, trunk, Feet...

134
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,001
This is the spine

135
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,429
The baby is moving a lot

136
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:13,767
Fantastic!

137
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,767
Looks like an alien

138
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,353
- Nurse?
- Yes?

139
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,855
Thank you very much

140
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,275
Congratulations, Su- hyun

141
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,449
Here's the prescription

142
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,787
- Just a second.
- Sure

143
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,038
- Did you see the baby on sonogram?
- Yes

144
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,210
When?

145
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,134
Come on, tell me quickly

146
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,216
What?

147
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,635
Okay

148
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,685
- Keep an eye on him.
- Okay

149
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,054
This is the list of food to avoid

150
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,933
during the pregnancy

151
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,353
You don't drink, do you?

152
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,529
Another abortion isn't good.
Take care of yourself

153
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,432
Excuse me!

154
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:41,889
Who is it?

155
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,063
Turn off the water, will you?

156
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,812
It's leaking downstairs

157
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,534
Did you turn it off?

158
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,124
Fuck!

159
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,926
KIM Hyuk-ju!

160
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,019
Shit

161
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,120
How much did you get?

162
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,787
From whom?

163
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,460
The lady from the studio!

164
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,292
She'll pay you the rest later?

165
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,969
You bought that?

166
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:58,432
What the fuck!
I didn't get anything!

167
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,728
We have pictures, punk

168
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,976
Bullshit!
You're writing a novel

169
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,770
Playing tough?

170
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:10,441
- Look here.
- Don't hit me!

171
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,195
You're messing with the wrong guy

172
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,942
Whatever!

173
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:20,659
You lay your hand on me again,
and I'm so suing you

174
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,661
Listen

175
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,875
Didn't I tell you to make it quick...

176
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,494
so we could eat?

177
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,208
Four prior convictions

178
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,040
A month out of the joint...

179
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,917
and you don't get it?

180
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,134
Your prints were found
at the crime scene

181
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,550
We have pictures of you
taking money from her

182
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,557
Tell us how much she promised you...

183
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,931
for killing her husband!
Motherfucker!

184
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,195
- Captain.
- What?

185
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,866
Any orders for me?

186
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,539
What orders?
This is no restaurant!

187
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,930
Let's give it a change

188
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,638
Make it two-five time

189
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,719
Okay?

190
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,957
These are all the unpicked- up ones

191
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,252
in the period of one month

192
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,298
You can tell a lot
from them

193
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,429
This one

194
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:53,934
This family took a trip
for the first time in a while

195
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:01,824
I think it's the youngest
taking pictures

196
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,615
Maybe this one

197
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,332
Her big brother must be on leave...

198
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,914
from the army

199
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:19,633
This girl is... his girlfriend?

200
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:24,218
She's not part of the family

201
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,851
considering she's dressed up...

202
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,638
while the others have shorts on

203
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:37,651
I don't watch TV

204
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:41,439
- This is more fun.
- Ms. JI Kyung- hee

205
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:46,611
Aren't you curious
how your husband died?

206
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,420
It was a heart attack

207
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,707
He appeared to have died
due to the smashed head

208
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,548
But there's more to it

209
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:07,883
Had the impact affected the brain...

210
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,475
an apnea would've resulted...

211
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:14,472
As the right part of his head
got smashed

212
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:18,226
the artery popped
which led to hemorrhage

213
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:24,195
It seems that he tried hard
to breathe

214
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,948
or kept spitting out words...

215
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,038
for help

216
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:36,290
Not only was there
blood on the floor

217
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:40,711
but his mouth to his lungs
were filled with blood too

218
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:46,634
That caused the cardiac arrest

219
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,055
In other words, a heart attack

220
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,384
That's the cause of death

221
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,938
You don't find it interesting?

222
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,024
Did you guys get along?

223
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,741
We were okay

224
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,611
You're married, you must know

225
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,789
Problems are often overlooked...

226
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,579
to keep the marriage together

227
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,453
How come no children?

228
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,297
I've call you back soon

229
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,801
I learned you'd had abortions.
Quiet a few times

230
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:31,636
Why?

231
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,432
How'd he find out?

232
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,229
It's me

233
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,945
I told you I'd call you back

234
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,157
I'm busy tonight

235
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:51,656
Yes

236
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,240
Do I have to tell you?

237
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:01,995
Yes

238
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,503
No, I'm not home

239
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,717
I've call you back later.
Bye

240
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,911
Who is your lover?

241
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,622
What do you mean?

242
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,747
You know KIM Hyuk-joo right?

243
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,044
How much did you offer?

244
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,840
Did you offer fair split?

245
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,139
What is this all about?

246
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:04,062
KIM Hyuk- soo confessed it all

247
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:07,061
What? He threaten me

248
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,031
Ah, there must be somebody
responsible for murder

249
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,739
Are you always like this?

250
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,536
Why did you give him the money then?

251
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,618
My husband promised to do so

252
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,083
That money was mean to be his

253
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,080
Then you should've told so before

254
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,924
I did not want to be
involved in a mess

255
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,726
Well, investigations will tell the truth

256
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:48,527
If I have to go to the office
I will

257
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,230
Will you...

258
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:55,030
be easier to confess for
your crime at the office?

259
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,512
You're not doing your lover...

260
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,314
any good by keeping quiet

261
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,227
Tell me

262
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,948
Have you ever hated your wife?

263
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,823
No particular reason

264
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:44,617
You'rejust sick of her

265
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,713
I thought it would pass

266
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,218
For 5 years

267
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,007
But it never did

268
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,518
I've get back to you

269
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,864
- Call.
- I will

270
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:17,899
Not me

271
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,199
The lady you talked to earlier

272
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,617
She must be waiting...

273
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,336
...for your call

274
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,764
- Come in
- Hello

275
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,976
- Bean sprouts please.
- For how much?

276
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,061
- 2 dollars please.
- Okay

277
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:51,892
Su- hyun

278
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,730
Most people put them
in boiling water

279
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,399
But I do it differently

280
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,318
Over bean sprouts...

281
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:06,327
I pour boiling water

282
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:10,920
This way they stay fresh

283
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:15,132
Here you go

284
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,340
Let's see

285
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,517
It's a killer!

286
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,806
Try it

287
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:40,240
- What you heard at the clinic...
- What?

288
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:46,530
I will get it

289
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,954
Hello?

290
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,124
Hey, CHO

291
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,130
What's going on?

292
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:04,299
I guess my cell phone is
out of battery

293
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,846
We'll talk tomorrow

294
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,313
Bye, CHO

295
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:10,697
He...

296
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,916
I'm sure he's innocent

297
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:23,628
He would come quite often.
Once a week

298
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,059
Keep 90mg

299
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:34,229
I think...

300
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,108
He had a crush on me

301
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:42,692
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

302
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,444
Sure

303
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,319
I was just testing my camera

304
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,243
You have my apology

305
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,915
It's okay

306
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:01,924
Why'd you take pictures
of your feet?

307
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,460
His feet?

308
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,632
His own bare feet

309
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,347
The whole roll

310
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:33,823
I thought they were pretty

311
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,332
That was the beginning

312
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,663
Hands at first

313
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,798
Then the shoulders

314
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,217
Maybe...

315
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,797
That's how he hits on girls

316
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,140
You know what?

317
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:01,725
It's quite boring
sitting alone at the studio

318
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,230
He started keeping me company...

319
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,448
and I was glad

320
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,534
Even thankful

321
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,899
Thank you. Bye

322
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,317
Bye!

323
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,229
- What was it?
- Me

324
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,529
- Who took these?
- You told him?

325
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,998
No, I couldn't

326
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,119
I have no idea
why I'm in those pictures

327
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,795
That was the last roll
from him

328
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:40,300
I was gonna develop them
when my husband was gone

329
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:48,150
Kyung-hee, I love you

330
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,027
Did he see this too?

331
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,119
He got furious

332
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,659
What's going on here?

333
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,127
Who the hell is he?

334
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,747
Don't you know?

335
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,545
They're from customers

336
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,259
It's the same goddamnjerk!

337
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,003
What's wrong with you?!

338
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,756
Why'd he take your picture?

339
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:22,635
I don't know!
I really don't!

340
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:32,443
But he didn't believe me

341
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:38,025
When I got back from the market...

342
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,806
- How do I look?
- Gorgeous!

343
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,728
Su- hyun

344
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,564
Look who's here!
Ka- hee, it's been so long

345
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,236
<i>hi,</i>
<i>hi</i>

346
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,325
You were fabulous

347
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,863
Here. Come on

348
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,205
Go ahead

349
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:52,371
You haven't changed a bit

350
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:55,462
Same old you from college

351
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,876
Look at Su- hyun

352
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,465
Who would think she's married?

353
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:03,212
Once she becomes a mom,
it'll be a different story

354
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,719
Gosh, are you expecting?

355
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,555
Congratulations!

356
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,020
That's really great

357
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,938
- Congratulations.
- Thanks

358
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,233
One, Two, Three

359
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,198
What's up, CHO?

360
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,826
Amen!

361
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:39,123
Sorry, Father.
I have to take this call

362
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:43,134
- See you at church.
- Sure. Bye

363
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,968
To you who are loved

364
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:51,844
and to myself who's become
an intruder

365
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,219
Where are you?

366
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,348
Five o'clock!

367
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:05,444
- What do you say?
- What?

368
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,287
If a familiar song is heard
when you don't expect it

369
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:11,530
you feel exhilarated

370
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,117
like having an orgasm

371
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:18,753
Did I give you that tonight?

372
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,039
I remembered

373
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:22,924
What?

374
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,626
Do you remember

375
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:28,547
when we went to the opening
of this wine cafe?

376
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:33,013
But it was under construction
with nobody around

377
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:36,221
- It was then.
- What?

378
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:40,521
Hesitating whether to leave

379
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,520
we did it on the stairway

380
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,235
One side of the wall was glass

381
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,029
And you said...

382
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,529
"Having sex looking down
at people outside,"

383
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:56,457
'It feels like doing the treadmill
at the gym.'

384
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,038
I did?

385
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:07,506
- It was that night.
- What about it?

386
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:10,008
I'm positive

387
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,515
When I got home that night

388
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:17,304
my cat cried hard into the night

389
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,139
Until dawn...

390
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,607
What's your point?

391
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,533
I'm 4 weeks pregnant

392
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,825
This is like a celebration party
for me

393
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,378
Why follow me?

394
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,418
Take your precious wife home

395
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:28,833
- What's going on?
- What?

396
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,426
That you're here

397
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:33,513
Why? I wasn't supposed to be?

398
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,716
Don't forget.
Su- hyun and I are friends

399
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:40,645
- Should I come with you?
- Where?

400
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,222
The hospital

401
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,159
I can't believe
I got knocked up at this age

402
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:00,907
Silly me, huh?

403
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,834
Should I keep it?

404
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,620
What do you say?

405
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,960
Some babies are blessed
from the womb

406
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,303
And others have to fear...

407
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:17,219
What do you want me to do?

408
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:20,059
Nothing!

409
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:24,272
Keep living happily with her
as you have

410
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,106
I'm not a home wrecker!

411
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:30,153
If I minded sharing you

412
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,067
I would've left you...

413
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:34,065
when you decided to marry her

414
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:35,817
Stop it, God damn it!

415
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,536
You think I'm happy?

416
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:43,788
What is it you want?
The baby?

417
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,251
Keep it then!

418
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,844
What is this?!

419
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,641
Are you trying to screw me?

420
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,477
- How Long?
- Sir?

421
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,771
How long since the murder?!

422
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:10,859
5 days

423
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:14,071
You know it's considered unsolved
past a week's mark

424
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:15,440
Solve it within this week!

425
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:20,570
- Hey, Captain Lee.
- Sir?

426
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:24,540
- You only have 3 days.
- Okay

427
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:27,001
Get moving!

428
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,840
JUNG Myung- sik is in Japan?

429
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:36,544
Yes, the school confirmed...

430
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,717
the seminar was set long ago

431
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:40,636
He's coming back tomorrow?

432
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:43,514
Right, arriving at 10:40

433
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,720
Tomorrow morning...

434
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,860
Captain

435
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,232
Yeah?

436
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:57,198
Reporters are talking

437
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,071
We can't hold KIM Hyuk-ju forever

438
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,320
Release him

439
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:56,750
I don't wanna see you

440
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:58,630
Ka- hee...

441
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:00,879
Let go! I'm showering

442
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,311
I got you something

443
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,019
- Ka- hee...
- Let go!

444
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,361
- Ka- hee, I am...
- Let go! Let go!

445
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:26,658
I'm sorry

446
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:28,952
Hands off, you bastard!

447
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,498
Listen to me!

448
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:33,586
How could you tell me
to abort...

449
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,126
Why'd you come to the concert?

450
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,759
- I'm sorry.
- Let Go!

451
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,298
It's all my fault

452
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:46,224
I'm SORRY, okay?!

453
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,221
I'm sorry

454
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,231
I'm sorry

455
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:04,442
I love you, Ka- hee

456
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,736
- I love you.
- I do too

457
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:51,740
I love you too

458
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,840
You're all mine!
I own you!

459
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,628
- I love you.
- I love you too

460
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,848
I love you so much

461
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,135
So much!

462
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:21,815
I love you.
I love you

463
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:23,896
I love you

464
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:38,036
Done. Left foot

465
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,920
Wish I had a son like you

466
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:52,217
To cut your toenails?

467
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:58,523
Fine, I've cut your toenails
for the rest of your life

468
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,688
Sleep over

469
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:13,113
You come and go
whenever you feel like

470
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:17,287
What's my place,
a rest stop along the highway?

471
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,956
And you don't pay me

472
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:24,791
- Money? How much do you want?
- What?

473
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,632
Your money is no good

474
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,923
What do you want then?

475
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:39,639
- Leave your heart with me.
- My heart?

476
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:42,938
Give me your hand

477
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,020
Here. My heart

478
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,856
- Ki- hoon.
- What?

479
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:50,984
You need to gain weight

480
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:54,704
Are you sure you're a cop?
You have no muscles

481
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:58,165
Don't rub it in!

482
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:01,832
- Come on in.
- No way!

483
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,996
I'm cold

484
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:09,840
Wait up, Ka- hee

485
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:30,189
Do you love Su- hyun?

486
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:33,902
I do

487
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,616
She loves me too

488
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,036
Are you sure?

489
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,912
You think you know her well?

490
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,832
She's not like us

491
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:50,919
nus'?

492
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,137
You think we're the same?

493
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:57,974
She's just different

494
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,936
Have you interrogated her,
Captain LEE?

495
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,770
Assuming she loves you...

496
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:08,315
because she fits into your life...

497
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,396
Isn't it too dangerous?

498
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:15,902
I'm not seeing you
cause I have issues with her

499
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,907
While I see you

500
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:25,832
I do my best to her

501
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:30,712
You do?
In what sense?

502
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:34,382
Fucking me hard

503
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:37,302
and keeping a beautiful family
with her?

504
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:39,808
Then...

505
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,220
Should I tell her?

506
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,768
What?

507
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:49,234
That you sound like a cat
reaching an orgasm

508
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:54,904
That you like me from behind...

509
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:57,128
Want some water?

510
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,922
No thanks

511
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:18,240
Smoking right after sex?

512
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:20,200
You're so bad

513
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,043
Su- hyun, sleeping?

514
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:41,241
My Heart

515
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,429
Hello?

516
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:28,241
Yes?

517
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:31,081
Captain!

518
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,789
Yes, we picked him up
at the airport

519
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:36,958
Yes

520
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:10,116
This picture.
You took it, didn't you?

521
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:13,411
It was found at the scene

522
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,876
And you left the country
And you left the country on the same day

523
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:20,419
This belongs to my son
who goes to primary school

524
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:24,882
He wrote it on the ground
and asked me to shoot it

525
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,629
for his girlfriend in class

526
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:33,845
And my trip was scheduled
last semester

527
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:38,482
You took pictures of JI Kyung- hee

528
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:42,444
- Who?
- The female owner of the studio!

529
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:45,030
- You took her pictures.
- No

530
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:47,274
Don't play hard ball

531
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:48,776
You took her pictures!

532
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:51,153
She asked me to

533
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:52,826
Cut the crap!

534
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:57,205
She brought us pictures you took
and told us everything

535
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,498
She asked me to!

536
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:02,373
She was so serious I agreed

537
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,007
It wasn't porn

538
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:06,878
I took nude pictures of her.
Is that a crime?

539
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,171
Nude?

540
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:13,050
You took nude pictures of her?

541
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:15,936
So you're telling me

542
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,180
JI Kyung- hee

543
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:22,769
asked you to take pictures
of her in the nude?

544
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,824
Look, Detective

545
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:33,537
I have a family

546
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,657
Honestly, it's embarrassing...

547
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,329
to even be here

548
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,169
Kyung- hee, right?

549
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:45,333
I think she had a crush on me

550
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:48,214
I'm sorry

551
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:49,757
I was testing my camera

552
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,135
Why didn't you tell me?

553
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,801
I could've been your model

554
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:00,726
Anything wrong?

555
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:06,232
You memorized my name
and phone number!

556
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:10,320
Of course you come
every week!

557
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:15,617
Why'd you take pictures
of your feet?

558
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:18,244
Of all the pictures

559
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,494
she showed so much interest
in my nude ones

560
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:24,000
Why'd you keep going back?

561
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:28,922
You're a man.
Put yourself in my shoes

562
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:32,842
She's pretty and mysterious

563
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:37,225
It's not a bad thing for a girl
to be aggressive

564
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:40,137
So I kind of enjoyed it

565
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:46,978
You play at a concert hall

566
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:49,150
and I sing at a basement cafe

567
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,824
We've turned out so differently

568
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:57,033
- Tomato juice?
- For her

569
01:00:57,863 --> 01:00:59,115
Coffee is mine

570
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:01,829
Thanks

571
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:09,041
Why not drinking it?

572
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,932
It's pretty good.
Try it

573
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:24,310
You're seeing Ki- hoon lately?

574
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:29,611
Change the subject

575
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:35,485
I've had enough

576
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:36,951
With what?

577
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:40,993
- Ka- hee, please...
- Please what?

578
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:42,161
Tell me

579
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,122
You like the way you live?

580
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:07,704
Didn't you tell me?

581
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:11,330
Taking pictures frees your soul...

582
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:14,917
...like a little boy

583
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:18,379
Please

584
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:31,149
She said her husband was
out of town

585
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:34,235
and asked me to take pictures
of her in the nude

586
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:38,611
I thought it was too much
so I refused at first

587
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:05,843
Then again, I sometimes hire
a professional model

588
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:10,518
and she was volunteering

589
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:14,105
So you did?

590
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:19,731
Mind giving me one?

591
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,621
Don't you like the thrill?

592
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:38,125
I do

593
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:41,253
Getting there...

594
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:43,721
is more fun than being there

595
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,305
Don't you have that experience?

596
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:51,680
Fucking is good

597
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,228
but the feeling after you come...

598
01:04:58,353 --> 01:05:00,105
I didn't sleep with her

599
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:20,067
- Talk to me.
- Yes Sir

600
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:23,563
It's true he was at the library.
His library card confirms it

601
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:26,612
What if he lent it to someone?

602
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:29,736
Keep digging for witnesses

603
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:32,159
And check out his wife too

604
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:33,407
- Yes Sir
- Okay

605
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,836
What now?

606
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:30,823
You know what?

607
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:37,702
It's quite boring
sitting alone at the studio

608
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:43,912
He started keeping me company.

609
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:46,631
And I was glad

610
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,297
Even thankful

611
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,437
That was the beginning

612
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:13,195
Hands at first

613
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:16,194
Then the shoulders

614
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,624
What do you think
it meant?

615
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,371
Maybe...

616
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:31,088
He wanted to sleep with me

617
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:04,561
Tell him about our rule

618
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,145
One more for the loser!

619
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:08,435
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

620
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,154
Come on!

621
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:17,274
You lost! One more shot!

622
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,650
Sorry about that

623
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:20,360
Give it here

624
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:21,656
- Captain
- What?

625
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:23,746
Let me drink
just beer

626
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:25,615
Shut up

627
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,242
You don't mix liquor

628
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:32,167
But once you do,
you go all the way

629
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:33,335
Take a note!

630
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:35,550
1 . You don't mix liquor

631
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:38,920
2. Shut up and drink

632
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:41,551
Whoever finishes last
gets one more

633
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:43,641
- Okay
- Sure

634
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:12,995
Ka- hee

635
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:16,420
It's me

636
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:24,640
Finger on the pad please

637
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,553
Try again please

638
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:31,893
Finger on the pad please

639
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:35,901
Try again please

640
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:37,903
What the...

641
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:41,733
Ka- hee!

642
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,361
It's me! Open the door!

643
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:49,123
Ka- hee!

644
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,133
It isn't easy for me either

645
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:05,511
I can't even buy you
the ring you want so badly

646
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:14,603
Su- hyun got an abortion
without me knowing

647
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:20,647
So open the goddamn door!

648
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:22,023
Open it!

649
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:24,321
It's me!

650
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:26,512
- Su- hyun, I...
- Please

651
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:31,426
I want a divorce

652
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,204
19 seconds

653
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:31,945
Gosh, you waited...

654
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,946
for too long.
I'm so sorry

655
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:34,742
Let me

656
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:38,585
I'm so sorry.
Just so many customers!

657
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:40,078
What kind of style...

658
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:41,329
- Sister.
- Yes?

659
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:45,253
Where's Hyuk-ju?

660
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:49,425
Who is...

661
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:53,133
Where's Hyuk-ju?

662
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:54,805
I don't know. I swear!

663
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:00,022
Where can I find him?

664
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:10,324
I really don't know

665
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:14,825
I miss him too!

666
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:20,535
Name's OH Yeon- shim.
They met at the bar

667
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:23,796
Hyuk-ju is crazy about her

668
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:26,214
Where can I find her?

669
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:28,501
I'm not sure

670
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,504
I heard she works at a cafe
called Purte

671
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:40,138
I met the studio owner
through my boss

672
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:42,477
He offered to buy me...

673
01:16:42,473 --> 01:16:45,317
an apartment if I gave him a child

674
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:51,153
It wasn't killing a baby,
but giving life to one

675
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:53,867
But Hyuk-ju completely lost it

676
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,953
when I told him

677
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:59,832
I didn't get it.
I'd be carrying the baby, not him!

678
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:08,337
What the fuck.

679
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:10,919
It seems there is
nobody that she meets?

680
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:14,844
What about the photos then?

681
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,261
Kyung- hee I love you?

682
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:18,180
I have all the evidences
You fuck- head!

683
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:20,018
Can't you do anything right?

684
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:31,823
I was trying to be nice
on you for Yeon- sim

685
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,738
Shit- heads like you...

686
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:38,453
and a hoe Yeon- sim,
that bitch...

687
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:40,823
you are all
retarded assholes

688
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:50,917
I met him later that day

689
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:57,140
Watching 'Kisses' on TV,
he said out of the blue...

690
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:03,897
I smashed his fucking head

691
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:18,327
Yeah.. No...

692
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:22,123
Didn't you used to run the show
in the morning?

693
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:26,539
I see

694
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:29,204
Thanks

695
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:48,316
Estimated time of death?

696
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,544
The line is busy...

697
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:19,593
Should we break up?

698
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:08,642
God damn it!

699
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:52,060
Let's eat out tonight

700
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:54,104
I'm getting off early

701
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:01,107
Let me have some of yours

702
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:07,037
Oh this!

703
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:09,118
Shoes for our baby

704
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:11,166
They're pink

705
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:13,536
I think I want a girl now

706
01:21:17,081 --> 01:21:19,459
I bought you a doll but...

707
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:21,756
forgot to get it out of the trunk

708
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:24,004
You'll like it

709
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,018
Bye

710
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:22,271
A Letter of Commendation This
commendation is for your determination...

711
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:24,865
with patriotism and commissions to...

712
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:27,326
control violence and drugs
crimes in the country

713
01:23:03,187 --> 01:23:05,531
You look great in uniform

714
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:09,193
- You look good too.
- Thank you

715
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:11,904
- Congratulations, Captain.
- Thanks

716
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:14,156
- Uh...Captain?
- Yeah

717
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:16,955
Should I take one of you?

718
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:20,329
Oh, he's Detective CHO?

719
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:24,504
Hi, the real Detective CHO

720
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:26,840
Sometimes, I'm Detective CHO too

721
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:31,257
Mind taking a picture?

722
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:33,884
- Of us together.
- Sure

723
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:36,228
One, two...

724
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:40,516
Pretty good

725
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:45,938
Wanna go in there?

726
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:47,531
Motel

727
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:51,735
We need to talk

728
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:56,866
You got a commendation.
It's your day

729
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:59,835
Let's not waste it
in a dim motel room

730
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:03,918
I have something to tell you

731
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:07,126
It's my birthday

732
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,837
Don't say anything to ruin it

733
01:25:14,568 --> 01:25:15,945
Happy Birthday

734
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:19,698
You didn't remember!

735
01:25:26,038 --> 01:25:29,338
Happy Birthday to you

736
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:32,840
Happy Birthday, Dear Ka- hee

737
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:35,134
Happy Birthday to you

738
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:44,223
No birthday present?

739
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:34,523
- What'd you do that for?
- I don't know...

740
01:26:36,358 --> 01:26:39,612
- This is fun.
- Come on, it's not

741
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:42,573
- Stay still!
- Does it hurt?

742
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:44,574
- Move your leg a bit.
- Okay now?

743
01:26:44,574 --> 01:26:46,326
- A little more.
- There?

744
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:03,769
Lucky it's not so cold

745
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,606
It would be terrible
if it was winter

746
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:13,441
We won't die in here
like this won't we?

747
01:27:13,437 --> 01:27:15,940
Don't talk like that

748
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:18,533
We are not far away
from the main road

749
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:23,447
What would people say
when they open up the trunk?

750
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:28,453
Your trousers are half open.

751
01:27:28,452 --> 01:27:30,921
And my skirt is up to the waist

752
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:32,998
What is this?

753
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:37,548
Should I strip you?

754
01:27:37,544 --> 01:27:39,467
Stay still

755
01:27:39,463 --> 01:27:41,340
- Keep still
- It hurts

756
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:43,216
Can you move your legs?

757
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:53,735
You see anything?

758
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:58,490
Never been in here before

759
01:27:58,482 --> 01:28:01,452
Hold this for me

760
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:04,704
Fuck! Its hot!

761
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:11,999
What for?

762
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:15,708
You gonna shot?

763
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:23,924
What's this?

764
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:27,519
I can't breathe

765
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:36,228
God damn it!

766
01:28:45,946 --> 01:28:48,199
He stayed out last night

767
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:54,629
No, not a single word

768
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:57,337
Okay, thanks

769
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:38,423
Recoil...

770
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:45,722
If we're found dead

771
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:49,726
we'll make the news, won't we?

772
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:53,305
What would they call it?

773
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:58,526
The end of a dirty liaison?

774
01:29:59,269 --> 01:30:00,737
Magazine...

775
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:02,822
<i>No</i>

776
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:11,160
Some might think
we chose to die together

777
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:14,330
- Slide...
- Dearest Captain...

778
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:20,917
Commits double suicide with a singer.

779
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:23,294
Ka- hee

780
01:30:24,461 --> 01:30:26,304
Do me a favor

781
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:29,095
Move your hand

782
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:48,323
'Kisses' 4:05
Estimated time of death?

783
01:30:54,532 --> 01:30:57,957
What about 'Kisses'!

784
01:30:57,953 --> 01:31:01,833
So after killing HAN,
hyuk-joo went into the motel.

785
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:04,175
And saw 'kisses' with yeon- sim

786
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:05,965
that's 4:05!

787
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:10,717
But estimated time
of death is at 5!

788
01:31:25,355 --> 01:31:26,902
We have to get out

789
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:29,822
Can we?

790
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:38,035
I am going to
We have to!

791
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:49,718
Don't wanna die like this?

792
01:31:52,549 --> 01:31:54,347
Don't worry

793
01:31:55,385 --> 01:31:58,013
The world will pity us

794
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:02,727
Not everyone can die
this tragically

795
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:07,610
Stop talking about dying!

796
01:32:10,066 --> 01:32:13,821
Su- hyun will come through

797
01:32:14,654 --> 01:32:16,907
as if nothing ever happened

798
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:21,454
Even if we die together

799
01:32:21,453 --> 01:32:23,626
she'll manage to be so calm

800
01:32:24,664 --> 01:32:28,919
What's wrong with you?!
Stop talking about dying!

801
01:32:39,929 --> 01:32:41,806
This is nice

802
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:47,938
Ki- hoon, are you hurt?

803
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:54,160
- Let me see.
- Please leave me alone

804
01:32:54,152 --> 01:32:55,950
Let me see...

805
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:27,940
I think it's morning

806
01:33:29,646 --> 01:33:30,943
How nice

807
01:33:32,357 --> 01:33:35,031
I finally got my wish

808
01:33:35,777 --> 01:33:38,405
That I woke up with you
in the morning

809
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:45,996
Ki- hoon, are you okay?

810
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:49,207
Are you aright?

811
01:34:19,529 --> 01:34:21,202
Ka- hee?

812
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:25,205
Ka- hee, are you home?

813
01:34:30,957 --> 01:34:32,334
Did anybody come?

814
01:34:33,459 --> 01:34:36,713
Su- hyun! What are you doing here?

815
01:34:40,383 --> 01:34:42,636
Have you guys met?

816
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:45,605
She's Su- hyun.
We went to high school together

817
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:47,398
He is...

818
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:50,606
A friend of mine.
Name's LEE Ki- hoon

819
01:35:28,848 --> 01:35:33,024
Are you happy with Su- hyun?

820
01:35:37,065 --> 01:35:41,536
Are you happy with her?

821
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:45,244
She loves me

822
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:47,826
Does she?

823
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:51,625
I---

824
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:54,624
I love you too

825
01:36:08,471 --> 01:36:11,224
Everybody that I love...

826
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:14,645
They all have rings on

827
01:36:15,353 --> 01:36:16,730
As if...

828
01:36:18,147 --> 01:36:23,529
As if they'd been born
with one on

829
01:36:26,823 --> 01:36:29,997
Does she have the same ring...

830
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:32,916
as yours?

831
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:03,444
I have to get out of here

832
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:07,539
I have to get out of here!

833
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:09,658
She's waiting

834
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:13,252
I have to get out of here!
She's waiting!

835
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:15,372
She's waiting?

836
01:37:15,371 --> 01:37:17,544
Yes, she's waiting

837
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:21,135
- For whom?
- Please let me out

838
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:23,137
Didn't I tell you?

839
01:37:23,463 --> 01:37:26,342
You don't know her

840
01:37:32,055 --> 01:37:33,307
I---

841
01:37:36,142 --> 01:37:37,610
...loved...

842
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:42,440
...my friend

843
01:39:17,743 --> 01:39:19,996
When it began...

844
01:39:21,747 --> 01:39:23,624
I don't remember

845
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:26,423
One thing I know is...

846
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:29,430
I initiated it

847
01:39:32,842 --> 01:39:34,560
I initiated it

848
01:39:34,552 --> 01:39:37,522
No, I loved it

849
01:39:38,473 --> 01:39:40,851
It's been a happy time

850
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:43,437
Even if my life had ended then...

851
01:39:45,730 --> 01:39:47,607
I wouldn't have been unhappy

852
01:39:52,945 --> 01:39:55,949
When I met you

853
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:58,121
a whole new world opened

854
01:39:59,535 --> 01:40:02,539
My life took a different course

855
01:40:03,164 --> 01:40:04,416
but Su- hyun...

856
01:40:04,957 --> 01:40:06,834
I was afraid...

857
01:40:08,461 --> 01:40:11,010
that will leave me
if she get married

858
01:40:11,881 --> 01:40:17,513
Yeah you choose
Su- hyun

859
01:40:18,638 --> 01:40:21,812
Su- hyun is the funny one

860
01:40:22,558 --> 01:40:24,811
By marrying that man.

861
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:30,028
I wanted to keep Ka- hee

862
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:39,034
Should I move to America
and raise the baby?

863
01:40:43,871 --> 01:40:48,342
In fact, I've already named the baby

864
01:40:49,168 --> 01:40:50,715
It's Jin-ju

865
01:40:51,254 --> 01:40:52,881
Jin-ju

866
01:40:53,548 --> 01:40:55,300
Tacky?

867
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:00,388
It means 'Pearl' in English

868
01:41:02,348 --> 01:41:04,100
Like that...

869
01:41:04,767 --> 01:41:09,022
ingle mom's girl in
'The Scarlet Letter.'

870
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:15,946
I've raise her like an angel

871
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:19,032
where nobody knows us

872
01:41:21,158 --> 01:41:26,710
In the forgotten memory

873
01:41:27,123 --> 01:41:32,300
The thought of you

874
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:37,138
Too painful to remember

875
01:41:40,469 --> 01:41:45,600
Look how lonely I am

876
01:41:46,642 --> 01:41:51,239
See how empty...

877
01:42:01,824 --> 01:42:04,247
Ki- hoon, look at this

878
01:42:04,243 --> 01:42:05,665
I'm bleeding

879
01:42:05,661 --> 01:42:08,289
I'm bleeding from down there!

880
01:42:12,835 --> 01:42:14,132
Oh God!

881
01:42:17,465 --> 01:42:20,139
My baby!

882
01:42:23,054 --> 01:42:24,852
Get me out of here!

883
01:42:25,473 --> 01:42:27,521
M)' My Poor baby! baby!

884
01:42:34,148 --> 01:42:36,321
I have to get out!

885
01:42:41,864 --> 01:42:45,619
Shut the fuck up, you skank!

886
01:43:01,759 --> 01:43:03,011
I'm scared

887
01:43:04,136 --> 01:43:05,809
I'm so scared

888
01:43:07,848 --> 01:43:11,898
I wish I could die in my sleep

889
01:43:13,938 --> 01:43:18,239
Will you help me do that?

890
01:43:19,944 --> 01:43:22,163
- Please kill me.
- What' s wrong?

891
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:24,122
My stomach hurts too much

892
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:29,454
I don't like the pain.
Please kill me

893
01:43:29,453 --> 01:43:32,753
- Please end my pain.
- I can't

894
01:43:32,748 --> 01:43:36,093
You do it.
You brought this on yourself

895
01:43:36,085 --> 01:43:37,758
Leave me alone

896
01:43:37,753 --> 01:43:42,008
You peed and shitted in your pants
and still wanna live?!

897
01:43:42,633 --> 01:43:44,556
You fucking bastard!

898
01:43:44,552 --> 01:43:49,934
You got us into this mess.
It's your fucking fault!

899
01:43:52,143 --> 01:43:56,068
Please kill me.
I don't like the pain

900
01:43:56,063 --> 01:43:59,158
I'm so scared

901
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:01,619
I'm scared like hell.
Please kill me

902
01:44:30,139 --> 01:44:33,063
Ka- hee, don't!

903
01:44:33,058 --> 01:44:37,108
I'm sorry!
It's my fault!

904
01:44:38,355 --> 01:44:40,357
- I've kill my self
- No, don't kill yourself!

905
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:42,860
I've be scared alone!

906
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:44,954
- Don't cry.
- Don't die

907
01:44:44,945 --> 01:44:46,913
It's okay. Don't cry

908
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:49,249
- Don't..
- No, No

909
01:44:49,241 --> 01:44:51,915
Don't cry. Don't cry...

910
01:44:52,745 --> 01:44:54,793
It's okay

911
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:02,338
It's all my fault

912
01:45:03,672 --> 01:45:06,050
I could've met someone else

913
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:09,145
if I had wanted to

914
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:11,472
I'm sorry

915
01:45:11,472 --> 01:45:14,726
But I couldn't

916
01:45:16,268 --> 01:45:20,489
Eating something delicious,
I thought of you and cried

917
01:45:21,649 --> 01:45:26,826
Waking up at night,
I missed you like crazy

918
01:45:28,948 --> 01:45:31,622
'Please let me stay with him

919
01:45:32,535 --> 01:45:35,709
for the rest of my life.'

920
01:45:36,247 --> 01:45:38,716
I prayed every day and night

921
01:45:43,546 --> 01:45:47,176
I'm sorry, Ka- hee

922
01:45:47,174 --> 01:45:50,849
- No.
- I'm sorry

923
01:45:50,845 --> 01:45:53,519
It's okay. Don't worry

924
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:58,569
I don't wanna get any lower

925
01:45:58,561 --> 01:46:01,656
No! No, Ka- hee!

926
01:46:01,647 --> 01:46:05,618
I couldn't be happier.
So please do it for me

927
01:46:08,571 --> 01:46:09,823
It's okay

928
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:13,618
- It's okay.
- No!

929
01:47:47,336 --> 01:47:49,634
That punk...

930
01:48:12,361 --> 01:48:17,834
Please... Please let me live

931
01:49:20,929 --> 01:49:22,101
Captain?

932
01:49:24,850 --> 01:49:26,022
Captain!

933
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:27,732
Captain!

934
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:29,938
CHO, get over here quick!

935
01:49:30,773 --> 01:49:32,025
Captain!

936
01:49:32,649 --> 01:49:33,901
It's me AHN

937
01:49:35,944 --> 01:49:37,446
Hurry up, CHO!

938
01:49:38,447 --> 01:49:39,619
Captain!

939
01:49:40,574 --> 01:49:42,042
Hang it there!

940
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:43,911
Get clothes for him!

941
01:49:49,958 --> 01:49:51,585
I'm sorry

942
01:49:54,630 --> 01:49:57,224
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry

943
01:49:57,758 --> 01:49:59,806
It's my fault

944
01:50:01,345 --> 01:50:03,564
- Are you okay?
- It's all my fault

945
01:50:03,555 --> 01:50:04,807
Captain!

946
01:50:36,463 --> 01:50:38,010
Captain! Captain!

947
01:50:38,257 --> 01:50:39,725
AHN!

948
01:50:41,552 --> 01:50:43,225
Come on, Captain!

949
01:50:45,347 --> 01:50:47,941
Captain, stop it!

950
01:50:48,267 --> 01:50:49,439
Let Go!

951
01:51:00,737 --> 01:51:03,160
The gun! Get the gun!

952
01:51:03,157 --> 01:51:05,410
Take the gun from him!

953
01:51:08,453 --> 01:51:09,830
Shit.

954
01:51:16,545 --> 01:51:17,546
Captain!

955
01:51:28,724 --> 01:51:30,021
Two days...

956
01:51:31,935 --> 01:51:35,735
I had spent two more days
with Ka- hee

957
01:51:37,858 --> 01:51:39,610
The smell of her blood...

958
01:51:43,363 --> 01:51:44,831
In the mean time

959
01:51:45,949 --> 01:51:49,419
I told the police
she had killed herself

960
01:51:54,166 --> 01:51:58,296
Nightmares haunt you forever

961
01:52:01,548 --> 01:52:02,720
When do you wanna move by?

962
01:52:03,008 --> 01:52:04,476
The faster, the better

963
01:52:04,927 --> 01:52:08,648
It might take a while
to find a buyer

964
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:10,437
with the economy so sluggish

965
01:52:10,432 --> 01:52:12,275
- I'm counting on you.
- Sure I've give you a call

966
01:52:12,267 --> 01:52:14,235
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye

967
01:52:20,359 --> 01:52:21,906
I'm selling the studio

968
01:52:24,571 --> 01:52:26,949
I can't run it alone

969
01:52:27,866 --> 01:52:30,289
I've left the force

970
01:52:34,248 --> 01:52:36,626
I can't believe
I put away the wrong guy

971
01:52:37,751 --> 01:52:40,800
Then again, he's been injail.
He'll do just fine

972
01:52:43,548 --> 01:52:45,926
Sorry I brought it up.
It's all over

973
01:53:01,483 --> 01:53:04,657
Is this called
'Our Lady of Grace'?

974
01:53:04,653 --> 01:53:08,408
Different names
for different postures, right?

975
01:53:09,449 --> 01:53:10,826
Tell me

976
01:53:12,995 --> 01:53:14,622
What can I do?

977
01:53:23,255 --> 01:53:24,677
Kyung-hee, I love you

978
01:53:24,673 --> 01:53:26,926
You said it wasn't for me

979
01:53:31,763 --> 01:53:35,518
I checked with the school
his son goes to

980
01:53:36,351 --> 01:53:39,981
No girl named Kyung- hee
in his class

981
01:53:44,234 --> 01:53:46,202
It doesn't matter now

982
01:53:50,741 --> 01:53:54,336
JUNG Myung- sik...
Did you love him?

983
01:53:59,541 --> 01:54:01,043
If I loved him...

984
01:54:05,547 --> 01:54:07,925
If I loved him, I'm forgiven?
