1
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:16,748
PASSING FANCY

2
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,987
"A geisha says she loves her client"

3
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,395
and he lies saying he'll come again

4
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:08,117
I fell for your honesty at first sight
I was so shy!

5
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:32,377
It's a shame to miss the main attraction

6
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,690
Story-telling for a kid is stupid

7
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:18,081
"Geisha Takao will come next month
Takao, in March"

8
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,084
Look at the barber

9
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,433
Forget your business, old man

10
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:54,148
"That was the true love of Takao
a geisha"

11
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:15,425
"Men yearn for love
Love is an emotional boat"

12
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,196
It's a wise remark

13
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,537
I hate girl-trouble

14
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:34,082
I hate money-trouble, but
welcome girl-trouble

15
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,618
Love is so elusive

16
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:45,062
Trust me and get married just once

17
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,459
You'll enjoy it

18
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:39,174
Have the bill charged to me

19
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:49,217
You must have been beautiful before

20
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,461
And now?

21
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,864
I can't be frank when I owe you money

22
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,237
Stop being curious, old man

23
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,470
Anywhere here I can stay?

24
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,442
Of course

25
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,350
I have a child, but no wife

26
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,528
Mind your son!

27
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,977
Homeless when you're so young?

28
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:24,278
I was at a spinning mill until yesterday

29
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,523
Fired?

30
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,256
No relatives?

31
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,897
That's an old trick, huh?

32
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,806
Young men have no pity

33
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,845
What are you going to do?

34
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:04,022
She can stay here
Will that be any trouble?

35
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,537
If so, I'll handle it

36
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,214
Dad! Your work!

37
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,829
Don't nag your father

38
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:06,298
Always be filial to your parents

39
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,604
Don't your teachers tell you that?

40
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,501
Did you know why a hand
has five fingers?

41
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:50,709
With only four
it wouldn't fit into a glove

42
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,188
Very funny

43
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,754
Thanks for last night

44
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:15,063
I spoke to her and decided
she'll work here

45
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,210
I was drunk. Did I force her on you?

46
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,612
She's very nice

47
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,890
I'm a good judge of people

48
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:48,427
Sorry, but I choose only people I like

49
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,317
Everyone is so kind to me

50
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,759
You hear that? How sweet!

51
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,488
What grade are you in?

52
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,997
My name's Tomio Kimur
I'm in third grade

53
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:18,215
My son Tomio is very intelligent

54
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,621
With better manners
he'd top his class

55
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:31,425
Yes! He's too good
for a dumb father like you

56
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:41,568
I'm not as dumb a father as they say

57
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,292
Doesn't Tomio need lunch?

58
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:13,744
The school feeds him
He's a "stupid" without lunch

59
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,946
You'd be a "dunce" without lunch

60
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,890
How can I go to grade school with kids?

61
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:34,757
He'd be the school's prize dunce

62
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:33,424
I forgot to ask your name

63
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:37,794
It's Harue

64
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,133
What was that?

65
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:46,866
Harue

66
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,126
She reminds me...

67
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:53,998
I mean Harue

68
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:59,435
She looks exactly like her

69
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:04,577
Who? The woman who jilted you?

70
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,547
No, not her

71
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,780
Who? That little slut?

72
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,362
Act your age

73
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,134
Age doesn't matter

74
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,805
I'll get an advance from him

75
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:44,049
I want to buy a gift for her

76
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:47,088
Don't ask too often

77
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,995
If he refuses, so what?

78
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,178
How stupid he is!

79
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,276
Where did you find the girl?

80
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:56,623
She's like my daughter

81
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,899
You're one to protect your treasures

82
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,663
How could you keep her?

83
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,037
Anyone who harms her dies
You understand?

84
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,897
For whom does she powder her face?

85
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:41,572
Ah, how very sweet!

86
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,269
It's a terrible waste!

87
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:55,386
Let's get going

88
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,464
No, not today

89
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,263
I have a stomachache

90
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:19,972
Drop the act!
No one appreciates your play

91
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,390
I forgot it

92
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,662
My safety charm

93
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:52,341
I don't dare go anywhere without it

94
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:25,704
May he get to the factory in a hurry

95
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:43,691
My stomach hurts so
I prayed for recovery

96
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,826
I'd better be going now

97
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,519
You're dressed up, Kihachi

98
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,695
Where's the funeral?

99
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,437
You think I'm going to a funeral?

100
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,304
How ominous!

101
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,285
Not going to work?

102
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:31,027
I bought it for you

103
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:58,450
Keep it a secret

104
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,216
She gets jealous

105
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,031
Do you like me?

106
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:16,972
You're so very kind to me, uncle

107
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:22,146
Don't call me uncle

108
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:29,579
Do you prefer me to Jiro?

109
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,128
He sort of scares me

110
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:48,868
But he's nice when you know him

111
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:54,574
On second thoughts I'm even better

112
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,619
This one really costs a lot

113
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:17,898
But the world is highly complicated

114
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,276
May I have this?

115
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,983
Do you like soldiers?

116
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,353
High ranking ones?

117
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,579
Let's go to Jiro's place

118
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,769
It was messy, so...

119
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,168
How kind you are!

120
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:48,178
Don't act so friendly, huh?

121
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,880
No more photos of you in uniform?

122
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,026
She wants some

123
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,430
You're shrewd

124
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:11,232
You made the kid say sweet words

125
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,288
My friend is at your shop

126
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,089
Go back quickly

127
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:07,389
You won't return evil for good
will you?

128
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,093
I'm not jealous

129
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:16,067
but don't ridicule the man next door

130
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:21,070
He has a reputation, too

131
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:27,013
I'm not so mean a woman

132
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:37,559
He's so kind to me that
I regard him as my uncle

133
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,356
Why not regard him as a husband?

134
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:56,376
You'll never be able to know

135
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,643
...the way I feel

136
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:08,281
I'm afraid I don't have time
for guessing games

137
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,977
"But now, ever since the accident..."

138
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,545
Come to the restaurant

139
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:12,387
The madam hasn't seen you
for a long time

140
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,821
I don't want to be with that Harue

141
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:48,249
I want to talk about her, do you mind?

142
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:54,097
Talk, I'm listening

143
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:01,528
I'll come to your place later. Wait for me

144
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:50,212
You look quite modern recently

145
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:53,723
It's the times

146
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:14,633
Do I look twice as handsome
as I used to?

147
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:56,216
Go somewhere and play

148
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,885
I'm busy studying now

149
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:42,089
Don't interrupt me

150
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:50,799
Just go out and play, will you?

151
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,068
It's a kind of filialness

152
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:22,930
Waiting is torture

153
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:51,731
There was no need for a gift
We can be informal

154
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:01,842
Actually, it's about Harue

155
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:09,409
She's so nice. I feel as if
she's one of the family

156
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:20,256
For that reason
I must think about her age

157
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:27,297
It's a pity to leave a girl her age alone...

158
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:33,634
With grown men like Jiro around

159
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:47,885
I'd be pleased if Jiro decided
to marry her

160
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:53,162
Did he make love to her?

161
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:59,496
I don't know
But be keeps away from her

162
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,969
She's too good for him

163
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:51,549
It's natural

164
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:55,448
I was wrong

165
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,127
She's too young for me

166
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:12,933
Did you fancy her as your wife?

167
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:19,346
Things like that can happen

168
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:53,410
It's so hot

169
00:45:56,887 --> 00:46:02,052
I'm asking you, for old times sake
to convince him

170
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:08,431
You have my trust. Please try

171
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:43,196
Whatever you may think
I'm picky about my woman

172
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:48,832
Oh? Frankly, she's too good for you

173
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,077
Then you marry her

174
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:08,515
It's good luck to be loved
by a young girl

175
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:17,593
I must have let down my guard with her

176
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:29,102
You sure are stubborn!

177
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:35,374
But then, so am I

178
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:46,385
I'll match you, that's for sure!

179
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:51,757
However, to Kihachi
this is a great tragedy

180
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:34,706
Why brood? Why not tell a story?

181
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:50,917
Young man

182
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:57,723
You call me young?

183
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:04,340
Do I really look so young?

184
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:12,842
Don't flatter me

185
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,403
I've got news! This boy's dad is stupid

186
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,139
No, he's not."

187
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:47,612
He can't even read, can he?

188
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:54,785
He just looks at cartoons

189
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:06,800
He doesn't go to the factory
Only to restaurants

190
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:51,092
Who did it?

191
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:54,963
I did. Me

192
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:12,579
I always tell the truth

193
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:21,654
George Washington cut down
a cherry tree

194
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:29,760
You cheat by saying what I don't know

195
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:39,672
Even the truth can't make you
a magician

196
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,872
You can't re-create the tree

197
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:57,950
What a dumb!

198
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:04,799
You don't work, you're always drunk

199
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:12,136
You trying to lecture your dad?

200
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:18,514
Drunk or sober, I'm still your dad

201
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,579
You're so dumb!

202
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:31,289
You can't even read, huh?

203
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,428
Newspapers you sell to junkmen

204
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:20,056
Son!

205
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:28,336
Forgive me, son

206
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:35,740
Something is wrong with me

207
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:56,726
I'm a dumb old dad, but don't hate me

208
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:27,986
"Then, the following morning..."

209
00:59:56,826 --> 00:59:59,158
That matter... how is it?

210
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:09,132
Don't be so hasty. Just leave it to me

211
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:21,744
Behave yourself at school
and be attentive

212
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:27,949
Be patient and study
and you'll get an education

213
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:35,125
I'm patient and go to the factory
So it pays me

214
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:49,376
50 sen

215
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:00,918
Buy whatever you want

216
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,262
How funny!

217
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,993
You can't live as a pauper's son

218
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:31,283
Examine it well. It's milled

219
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:38,554
You can polish your nails

220
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:50,700
Very funny

221
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:01,010
How extravagant today!

222
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:15,262
I haven't taken care of him properly

223
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:21,165
I want to act like a good father

224
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:28,408
50 sen is a lot to a boy his age

225
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,714
Like 10 yen to us

226
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:36,777
Not ten. You mean a thousand!

227
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:49,625
I want him to feel as if he's rich
just once in his life

228
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,403
About Jiro...

229
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:09,917
It's time you accept, Jiro

230
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:14,178
It's time you quit nagging me

231
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:35,702
You're to go home. Your son is ill

232
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:48,582
My son can't possibly be ill

233
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:53,924
But he could get hurt

234
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:07,874
Why did you get sick so suddenly?

235
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:23,025
He ate his fill in one go

236
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:27,656
You spent it all?

237
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:36,369
It's difficult for a poor man's kid

238
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:43,806
You did it. You gave him too much

239
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:53,086
Nurse him carefully

240
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:18,780
A mere stomachache

241
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:48,508
Have a drink and go to sleep

242
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:58,111
This wine is very mellow

243
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:36,949
I was worried. I left work early

244
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:54,067
It's serious. So do something

245
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,309
Don't shock me

246
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:04,044
He's my son. He can't die so easily

247
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:13,094
Have a doctor examine him

248
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,058
Get ready, old man

249
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,280
Then, 48 hours later

250
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,630
We'll try our best

251
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,865
This charm is very effective

252
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:44,937
It's terrible

253
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:51,113
We may have to hold a funeral

254
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:03,629
I'm glad I have formal summer wear

255
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:08,736
Don't tempt Fate

256
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:15,502
Don't worry. Your son won't die

257
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:23,450
You say that because he's not your son

258
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:35,520
I'm sorry, but I have to go now

259
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:44,003
I'll leave Harue

260
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,570
If she can help, just ask her

261
01:10:57,853 --> 01:11:00,651
Your son's teacher is here

262
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:05,924
I can't talk to a teacher

263
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:11,094
Will you greet him for me?

264
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:42,189
You must be very worried

265
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:59,273
You have the ball game?

266
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:04,179
We beat Class Three's team

267
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:17,261
What's the problem?

268
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:32,145
50 sen's worth of candy all at once

269
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:36,475
Orange pop, jelly...

270
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:40,749
...cookies, fried cake...

271
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:44,124
...toffee and watermelon...

272
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:50,597
I guess it was all my fault, huh?

273
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:56,563
I gave him cold wine, too

274
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:04,845
Not only that, he ate bananas

275
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:15,656
What's his illness called?

276
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:21,962
An acute intestinal catarrh

277
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:51,322
Your pals want you to get well
and return to school

278
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:59,362
Tomio's a bright boy
He'll be a great man some day

279
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:07,307
Be a good boy and get well

280
01:15:27,589 --> 01:15:29,113
Hear what he said?

281
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:36,727
He's very kind

282
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:53,143
So now you must get well

283
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:11,496
I have only you

284
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:16,530
So don't die before I do

285
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:57,570
Do you know why a hand
has five fingers?

286
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:10,183
I'll never forget that one

287
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,387
Can't even make 5 yen

288
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:03,645
It's a shame to be uneducated

289
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:09,583
I made my son ill and can't pay the bill

290
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:18,386
The factory won't give me an advance
I can't get money

291
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:30,433
I have a bad habit of
spending every penny

292
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,584
Don't do that, old man

293
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:03,235
The doctor wants to talk to you

294
01:19:22,824 --> 01:19:25,622
What's the big problem?

295
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:31,662
How can I pay the hospital?

296
01:19:38,406 --> 01:19:40,340
How much money do you need?

297
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:45,276
Maybe forty or fifty yen

298
01:19:58,059 --> 01:20:00,527
I'll raise the money

299
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:04,565
I'm sure I can

300
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:14,573
Now is the time I can
repay your kindness

301
01:20:25,887 --> 01:20:28,355
What a wonderful girl!

302
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:35,827
Such a young girl trying to save a man!

303
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:45,061
Hearing your works
I could even lose Tomio

304
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:50,409
He would gladly die, too

305
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,089
I'll bring the money soon

306
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:05,419
Don't be so proud!

307
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:13,691
I may be poor
but I won't depend on you

308
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:19,233
Hurry up and go to the hospital

309
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:25,537
I want to talk with her for a while

310
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,227
Stay put in your place

311
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:52,937
Do you think you can shame
the two of us?

312
01:22:01,816 --> 01:22:06,810
But this is my chance to
pay back his kindness

313
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:15,789
That's an excuse. People would think
we made you sacrifice

314
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:29,608
What happens to a young person
who tries to raise lots of money?

315
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:40,219
Who cares what happens to me?

316
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:43,686
Who cares about me?

317
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:51,989
I'll raise the money

318
01:22:55,937 --> 01:22:59,373
Haven't you any idea how I feel?

319
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:20,721
Don't say anything. Just obey me

320
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:35,632
I know a place where I can get money

321
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:43,708
Why do you need so much money?

322
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:49,654
I can't tell you. Just lend it to me

323
01:23:53,928 --> 01:23:56,761
We're old friends. Please

324
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:15,446
I know you'll pay me back, but

325
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,320
When will you repay me?

326
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:27,828
"Hokkaido Needs Men!"

327
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,629
After I get to Hokkaido

328
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:39,202
I was only kidding

329
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:07,160
Thanks to warm-hearted people...

330
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:23,711
Know why sea water is salty?

331
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:33,021
To salt salmon with

332
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:37,320
Very funny

333
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:48,399
Give me another fifty sen and try

334
01:26:01,356 --> 01:26:06,055
Don't pester people. You should've died

335
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:12,230
Wanted to eat funeral cake, did you?

336
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:32,813
You told me a lie

337
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:39,254
This water is salty
but there's no salmon. Why?

338
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:52,663
Suddenly Jiro is going to repay me

339
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:13,318
All this brat does is cause trouble

340
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:03,543
It's not goodbye forever. Don't cry

341
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:09,815
When you finally understand me
we must part

342
01:28:12,987 --> 01:28:17,048
I don't think I'll ever be happy

343
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:24,354
Don't be pessimistic

344
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:29,534
Be patient for a while

345
01:28:32,206 --> 01:28:34,504
I'm going willingly

346
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:39,570
I hate sad farewells

347
01:28:58,633 --> 01:29:01,329
I'll come back, I promise

348
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:26,516
Are you going to Hokkaido?

349
01:29:28,896 --> 01:29:33,697
I've no right to complain
but you might have told me

350
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:38,331
Let me go to Hokkaido

351
01:29:44,979 --> 01:29:47,447
You have Tomio, old man

352
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:52,717
Kids don't need parents

353
01:29:54,255 --> 01:29:56,951
Tomio will flourish without care

354
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:08,060
You have a great future, Jiro

355
01:30:11,372 --> 01:30:14,603
People will be relying on you

356
01:30:21,315 --> 01:30:23,875
I leave at ten. Don't stop me

357
01:30:50,545 --> 01:30:52,638
I didn't mean to

358
01:30:55,049 --> 01:30:56,744
Don't hate me

359
01:31:36,257 --> 01:31:37,918
I'm going there

360
01:31:42,864 --> 01:31:44,764
Take care of Tomio

361
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:57,071
I can give up the money knowing
it saved the boy's life

362
01:32:00,581 --> 01:32:06,076
You needn't go so far away
leaving your son behind

363
01:32:09,457 --> 01:32:12,756
Your sincerity moves me. It's enough

364
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:27,367
Accept his kindness
You can work and repay him

365
01:32:33,614 --> 01:32:35,980
We must help one another

366
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:02,738
The barber talks like a saint

367
01:33:07,515 --> 01:33:12,543
It's nice to live long
I've never felt any better

368
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:31,499
Remember to obey
your teachers at school

369
01:33:36,677 --> 01:33:39,578
Don't eat too much candy

370
01:33:43,084 --> 01:33:44,881
Will you be back?

371
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:52,482
What a silly question!

372
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:11,908
I'm taking a vacation

373
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:41,199
Know why a hand has five fingers?

374
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:53,103
If we had only four
it wouldn't fit a glove

375
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:10,230
What's that land?

376
01:36:14,034 --> 01:36:15,160
America?

377
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:20,930
We've just left the port

378
01:36:55,176 --> 01:36:58,577
My son is a bright boy at school

379
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:07,145
With better manners, he'd be top

380
01:37:34,949 --> 01:37:36,382
No! No!

381
01:37:42,489 --> 01:37:44,650
Won't this boat stop?

382
01:37:50,197 --> 01:37:52,665
Is that land linked with Tokyo?

383
01:37:54,268 --> 01:37:55,326
Of course it is

384
01:38:00,808 --> 01:38:03,868
I'm sorry, but I'll go home

385
01:39:09,143 --> 01:39:11,236
Why is sea water salty?

386
01:39:14,815 --> 01:39:17,045
To salt salmon with

387
01:39:19,887 --> 01:39:21,548
Very funny
