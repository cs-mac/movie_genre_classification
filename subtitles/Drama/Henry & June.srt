1
00:01:03,078 --> 00:01:04,639
Oh, my.

2
00:01:04,678 --> 00:01:06,719
Hope you haven't
been waiting long.

3
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:08,286
I'm usually
the first one here.

4
00:01:08,327 --> 00:01:11,393
Sorry about that.
All right.

5
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,778
I think you're gonna like this
three-bedroom property, Mr. Poole.

6
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:18,205
Right through here, this bathroom
has been completely redone--

7
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:20,002
new tiles, new sink.

8
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,046
There are walk-ins
in every room.

9
00:01:22,086 --> 00:01:24,290
And right through here
is the kitchen.

10
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:26,715
Look at this skylight.
That is nice.

11
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,515
And the cabinets, I believe

12
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,786
are original, which some
people really enjoy.

13
00:01:30,822 --> 00:01:32,926
And if you follow me
to the backyard--

14
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,203
And,  uh...

15
00:01:35,238 --> 00:01:39,013
What about the other house?
The one down the street.

16
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:40,639
Oh, right.

17
00:01:40,678 --> 00:01:43,994
Well, I made the offer
like you asked,

18
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,566
but they didn't
want to sell.

19
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:47,428
Yeah, that house
is not on the market.

20
00:01:47,462 --> 00:01:50,691
I mean, did you tell them
that I'd pay whatever they wanted?

21
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:54,142
I did, Mr. Poole.
They live there.

22
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:56,517
They like it.
That's their home.

23
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,484
But anyway,
back to this place...

24
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:02,460
Let me just show you
this backyard.

25
00:02:02,502 --> 00:02:05,567
Are you from California,
Mr. Poole?

26
00:02:05,606 --> 00:02:07,068
The weather's so nice here.

27
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,703
A lot of Californians
spend time in their backyard.

28
00:02:08,742 --> 00:02:11,108
And look at this--
there's plenty of room for a pool

29
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:13,663
- or a hot tub--
- How much?

30
00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:16,320
Well, they're asking 325.

31
00:02:16,357 --> 00:02:19,358
I'm sorry, could you
mind repeating that?

32
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:21,121
I just have trouble
with this ear.

33
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:24,419
Oh, I'm sorry. I was
saying they're asking 325.

34
00:02:27,142 --> 00:02:29,084
Okay, I'll take it.

35
00:02:29,126 --> 00:02:31,264
Well.

36
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:35,098
Mr. Poole, I'm pretty sure I could
get them to knock off 25 or 30.

37
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:38,621
I mean, look at this place.
It needs to be re-stuccoed and--

38
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:39,971
It's okay.

39
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:41,893
I'll pay what
they're asking.

40
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:43,584
But look at the place.

41
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:46,044
I mean, it needs paint
at the minimum

42
00:02:46,086 --> 00:02:49,883
and the landscaping really
leaves a lot to be desired.

43
00:02:49,926 --> 00:02:52,959
I'd like to pay
what they want.

44
00:02:52,997 --> 00:02:56,031
No negotiating,
no repairs, just--

45
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,499
But Mr. Poole--

46
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:59,483
Mrs. Wyat,

47
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:03,170
you need to just
let this go. Okay?

48
00:03:03,206 --> 00:03:06,402
The higher the price,
the bigger your commission.

49
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:09,786
- So...
- Okay, then.

50
00:03:19,237 --> 00:03:21,506
# Don't got a lot of time #

51
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,908
# Don't give a damn #

52
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:26,429
# Don't tell me
what to do #

53
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,324
# I am the man #

54
00:03:28,357 --> 00:03:31,226
# If there's a God
up there #

55
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:33,757
# Something above #

56
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:36,067
# God, shine your light down here #

57
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:37,792
# Shine on the love #

58
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:40,033
# Love of the loveless #

59
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:45,059
# Love of the loveless #

60
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:50,437
# Don't have too many friends #

61
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:52,836
# Never felt at home #

62
00:03:52,868 --> 00:03:55,040
# Always been my own man #

63
00:03:55,076 --> 00:03:57,084
# Pretty much alone #

64
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,710
# I know how to get through #

65
00:03:59,749 --> 00:04:02,433
# And when push comes to shove #

66
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:04,672
# I got something that you need #

67
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,465
# I got the love #

68
00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:08,989
# Love of the loveless #

69
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:13,181
# Love of the loveless #

70
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,980
# Love of the loveless #

71
00:04:20,837 --> 00:04:22,976
# The love of the loveless #

72
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:28,669
# All around you,
people walking #

73
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:31,197
# Empty hearts
and voices talking #

74
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:34,400
# Looking for and finding #

75
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:35,778
# Nothing #

76
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:55,199
# Don't got a lot of time #

77
00:04:55,236 --> 00:04:57,506
# Don't really care #

78
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,223
# Not selling anything #

79
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:02,464
# Buyer beware #

80
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,955
# If there's a God
up there #

81
00:05:04,996 --> 00:05:07,168
# Something above #

82
00:05:07,204 --> 00:05:09,725
# God, shine your light
down here #

83
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:10,909
# Shine on the love #

84
00:05:10,948 --> 00:05:13,021
# Love of the loveless #

85
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:17,979
# Love of the loveless. #

86
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:41,562
Hi.

87
00:05:41,604 --> 00:05:43,992
I'm your neighbor from--
from next door,

88
00:05:44,035 --> 00:05:45,246
Esperanza Martinez.

89
00:05:45,284 --> 00:05:48,382
I just want to come by
and say hello,

90
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,841
um, welcome you
to the neighborhood.

91
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:54,047
Hello.
Homemade tamales for you.

92
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,393
Oh.

93
00:05:55,427 --> 00:05:56,922
Thank you.

94
00:05:56,964 --> 00:05:58,426
I used to be...

95
00:05:58,468 --> 00:06:00,769
good friends with the man
who lived here.

96
00:06:00,804 --> 00:06:04,066
I was actually
the one who found him.

97
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,888
Found him where?

98
00:06:05,923 --> 00:06:08,063
- There in your kitchen.
- Oh.

99
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,466
He died of a heart attack.

100
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:12,921
Fue terrible.

101
00:06:12,963 --> 00:06:14,457
It was terrible.

102
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,144
He had been laying there
for 10 hours, they think.

103
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:20,635
- Here?
- Yes.

104
00:06:20,676 --> 00:06:23,491
We were good friends.

105
00:06:23,523 --> 00:06:25,891
So where are you from?

106
00:06:25,924 --> 00:06:28,607
Not here.

107
00:06:28,643 --> 00:06:30,782
Oh.

108
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,470
Thank you for
the tamales.

109
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:38,008
You're welcome.

110
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:41,883
Looks like you're burning.

111
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:44,257
- I am.
- Are you wearing any sunscreen?

112
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:47,898
Well, I would have called
before I stopped by,

113
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:49,979
but you still don't
have a phone.

114
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:52,670
- No.
- Yeah, and I rang the--

115
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,707
Anyway, I just wanted to make sure
you're doing okay

116
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:58,464
and that the move
went well.

117
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,433
And did you notice that
we re-stuccoed and painted?

118
00:07:01,474 --> 00:07:03,996
Yeah, I noticed that.

119
00:07:04,036 --> 00:07:06,752
Didn't I ask you
not to do that?

120
00:07:06,787 --> 00:07:08,795
Yeah, well...

121
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:11,388
- I just thought--
- The thing is...

122
00:07:11,426 --> 00:07:13,794
I'm not gonna be living here
that long, Mrs. Wyat,

123
00:07:13,827 --> 00:07:15,834
so it's really just
a waste of time.

124
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,849
What do you mean, you're not
gonna be living here that long?

125
00:07:22,434 --> 00:07:24,475
And for the record,

126
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:27,744
whoever did it,

127
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,787
they did kind of
a lousy job.

128
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:32,194
It's all discolored
right there.

129
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:36,450
Oh, well...

130
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:38,270
we can have
that fixed.

131
00:07:38,306 --> 00:07:40,445
No, don't bother.

132
00:07:40,482 --> 00:07:42,490
It doesn't matter.

133
00:07:45,826 --> 00:07:47,517
- Oh.
- Well.

134
00:07:49,826 --> 00:07:51,615
Anyhow.

135
00:08:00,642 --> 00:08:02,551
Looks like you're burning.

136
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:05,016
- I am.
- Are you wearing any sunscreen?

137
00:08:06,723 --> 00:08:08,665
Well, I would have called
before I stopped by,

138
00:08:08,707 --> 00:08:11,424
but you still don't
have a phone.

139
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,149
And  I rang the  bell.

140
00:08:13,186 --> 00:08:15,096
Well?
And did you notice

141
00:08:15,138 --> 00:08:17,145
that we re-stuccoed
and painted?

142
00:08:17,186 --> 00:08:19,642
Yeah, I noticed that.

143
00:08:19,682 --> 00:08:22,268
Didn't I ask you
not to do that?

144
00:08:22,306 --> 00:08:24,062
Yeah, well...

145
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:26,139
- I just thought--
- The thing is,

146
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:28,317
I'm not gonna be living here
that long, Mrs. Wyat.

147
00:08:28,354 --> 00:08:31,738
So it's kind of
a waste of time.

148
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,469
What do you mean, you're not gonna be
living here that long?

149
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:35,416
And for the record,

150
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,880
whoever did it,

151
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:39,994
they did kind of
a lousy job.

152
00:08:40,034 --> 00:08:41,660
It's all discolored
right there.

153
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:42,746
Oh, well...

154
00:08:42,787 --> 00:08:44,608
we can have
that fixed.

155
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:46,463
No, don't bother.

156
00:08:46,499 --> 00:08:48,767
It doesn't matter.

157
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:50,143
Anyhow.

158
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:05,626
What are you doing?

159
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,346
Oh my God.

160
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,828
Yes! Really. Really.

161
00:10:28,865 --> 00:10:31,800
Yes! Yes!

162
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:39,129
I don't know anything
for sure, but...

163
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,583
It's-- it's like...

164
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:46,302
Oh, please please
please please.

165
00:10:46,337 --> 00:10:48,759
Okay.
Okay. Okay.

166
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:51,037
Thank you.
See you soon.

167
00:10:51,073 --> 00:10:55,415
Mr. Poole, something very
wonderful has happened--

168
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:56,863
Were you just in
my backyard?

169
00:10:56,897 --> 00:10:58,457
Did you not look?

170
00:10:58,497 --> 00:11:00,863
Were you looking
in the windows?

171
00:11:00,896 --> 00:11:02,358
Ay, no!

172
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:05,401
Of course not.
Did you not see?

173
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:07,263
See what?

174
00:11:07,296 --> 00:11:09,304
- Oh. Oh my God.
- l...

175
00:11:09,344 --> 00:11:10,774
I-- I saw you.

176
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:12,758
You were running around.

177
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,518
Oh. Oh.

178
00:11:15,553 --> 00:11:17,178
Do you need
to borrow something?

179
00:11:18,881 --> 00:11:20,638
Okay, I'll see you later.

180
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,818
You don't see it?

181
00:11:37,857 --> 00:11:39,350
See what?

182
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:43,387
All I see is a water stain
from a lousy stucco job.

183
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:45,814
You are not looking.

184
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:54,202
I-- I don't see anything.

185
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,917
You are not looking.

186
00:11:57,952 --> 00:12:00,536
Es el rostro de Dios.

187
00:12:00,576 --> 00:12:02,910
The face of God.

188
00:12:02,945 --> 00:12:05,083
The face of Christ.

189
00:12:05,121 --> 00:12:08,317
It's-- it's like a sign
from God.

190
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,070
Look, the only sign
I see is that

191
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:13,013
you seem a little overexcited.

192
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:15,161
It's probably the heat.

193
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,022
I think the heat
has gotten to you.

194
00:12:17,056 --> 00:12:18,397
- Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

195
00:12:18,431 --> 00:12:21,149
I-- l-- I know it's
hard to believe it.

196
00:12:21,185 --> 00:12:24,283
But the proof is right--
right there.

197
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,143
All  right.

198
00:12:27,103 --> 00:12:28,696
You just going
to ignore it?

199
00:12:28,736 --> 00:12:31,322
No. No.

200
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,661
I am gonna
ignore you, though.

201
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:45,080
So who were you
talking to?

202
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:46,548
To you.

203
00:12:46,592 --> 00:12:49,494
No, I mean in your yard.
You were on the phone.

204
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:51,869
- Who were you talking to?
- Mmm.

205
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,431
Excuse me?

206
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:58,333
Stay there.

207
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,268
Yeah?

208
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:04,311
Hi, I'm looking for
Esperanza Martinez.

209
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,587
Said she would be here.
I'm Father Vincent Salizar

210
00:13:06,623 --> 00:13:08,184
from St. Ramos
Catholic Church.

211
00:13:08,224 --> 00:13:09,751
She called and asked me
to meet her here--

212
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:11,678
Disculpame.
Que bueno que llego.

213
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:13,719
It's in the backyard.
I'll show you.

214
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,483
Ven. Come in, come in,
come in.

215
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,236
Mire.
Pares aqui.

216
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:21,174
Aqui aqui.
Pares aqui. Aja.

217
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:23,735
Look, I don't know
what you're up to,

218
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:25,630
but I didn't say
you could come back here

219
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:27,900
and I'd like you
to both leave.

220
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,422
You see?

221
00:13:30,462 --> 00:13:32,634
Well, I do see something.

222
00:13:32,672 --> 00:13:35,671
- Very sorry about the intrusion, Mr.--
- Poole.

223
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:36,922
Henry Poole.

224
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,748
Mr. Poole, I apologize.

225
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:40,539
So...

226
00:13:40,574 --> 00:13:42,430
you do see it?

227
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:47,483
Well, I can see how it could
be interpreted as a face.

228
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,625
- Oh my God.
- That's quite clear.

229
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,309
But the face of Christ?

230
00:13:53,344 --> 00:13:55,067
I'm not so sure that

231
00:13:55,104 --> 00:13:57,077
we can make that leap.

232
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,778
Thank you.
Thanks.

233
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:00,790
You see?
You understand?

234
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:02,456
And like I was saying,

235
00:14:02,494 --> 00:14:04,535
I'd like you to both leave.
I'm kinda busy in there.

236
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:07,160
No no no no no.
Look. Look.

237
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:10,265
You can see--
the eyes here

238
00:14:10,303 --> 00:14:12,277
and the beard here.

239
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:16,694
And the holy shoulder.

240
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:20,958
Everything. Everything, Padrecito.
Everything.

241
00:14:20,991 --> 00:14:23,379
I can see how
it could be that.

242
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:26,423
These types of things should
not be easily discounted,

243
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:29,910
but we do have to take
these things at face value,

244
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,063
no pun intended.

245
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,437
Look, the face value of this

246
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,379
is that it's a water stain.

247
00:14:35,422 --> 00:14:37,015
Right?

248
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,836
- Right?
- You're probably right, Mr. Poole.

249
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,781
Yeah. Yeah.

250
00:14:41,823 --> 00:14:43,732
And by no means does
the church condone

251
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:46,622
any kind of frivolous
claims of this nature, but--

252
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:48,956
But nothing.
Look,

253
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:51,837
the game's over, okay?
That's not the face of Christ

254
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,456
and I want to be
left alone!

255
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:55,802
You're right.

256
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,977
You're right, Mr. Poole.

257
00:14:58,014 --> 00:15:00,382
We've imposed enough.

258
00:15:00,414 --> 00:15:01,658
Esperanza, let's go.

259
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:04,597
No no, espere un minuto,?si?

260
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,980
Mr. Poole,

261
00:15:06,015 --> 00:15:08,535
you can't ignore this, please.

262
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,477
- Es que espere, mejor-- mejor, si.
- Esperanza--

263
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,038
- vamonos.
- Por favor, espere un minuto.

264
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,508
Mr. Poole,

265
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:18,902
don't you believe in God?

266
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:22,837
Please! Please.

267
00:15:24,638 --> 00:15:26,908
Es que-- es el rostro
de Dios.

268
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:28,829
Sus ojos.

269
00:17:13,053 --> 00:17:15,639
Excuse me.

270
00:17:15,677 --> 00:17:17,587
No, wait...

271
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:51,995
These types of things

272
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,655
should not be
easily discounted,

273
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:56,377
but we do have to take
these things at face value,

274
00:17:56,413 --> 00:17:57,787
no pun intended.

275
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,250
Yeah, well, I agree--

276
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:04,986
Please...

277
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,104
It's gonna be okay.

278
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:12,050
We're gonna be okay.

279
00:18:14,012 --> 00:18:15,703
I'm sorry.

280
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,464
I'm sorry.

281
00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:23,096
Hello?

282
00:18:23,132 --> 00:18:25,751
Hi. I'm Henry.
I live next door.

283
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:27,381
Oh, yeah.

284
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:29,308
I saw you move in.
I'm Dawn.

285
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,577
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

286
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:34,034
Anyway, your daughter,
I guess,

287
00:18:34,076 --> 00:18:36,377
she dropped this
in my backyard.

288
00:18:36,412 --> 00:18:38,452
Oh, God, I'm--
I'm so sorry.

289
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:41,623
I keep telling her to stay
out of other people's yards.

290
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,857
No, it's not a problem.
She was just walking around back there.

291
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:47,543
Did she tape you?

292
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,225
Um...
I don't know.

293
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,786
'Cause she does that
sometimes.

294
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:55,064
She tapes people.

295
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,271
Why does she do that?

296
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,067
Uh...

297
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:03,668
I don't know.

298
00:19:06,972 --> 00:19:10,070
Um, well, I've got to go.
But thank you so much

299
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,148
for bringing this
back to Millie and...

300
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:14,740
I'll make sure that she
stays out of your yard.

301
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,234
You having
another party?

302
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:27,382
Sorry?

303
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:30,267
Well, I've seen you in here a couple
of times buying the same stuff.

304
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,373
I thought maybe-- Uh...

305
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:35,412
That'll be $155.82.

306
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,162
I thought maybe you might
be throwing some parties.

307
00:19:39,197 --> 00:19:41,651
No parties.

308
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:46,296
Well, that doesn't look like
a very healthy diet.

309
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:49,976
Just kind of a phase.

310
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:07,864
Andales. Andales.
Hurry hurry.

311
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:11,569
Go go go with me.

312
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:12,986
Hurry, girl! Hurry.

313
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,229
Hurry, Margie.

314
00:20:18,748 --> 00:20:21,563
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God.

315
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,156
- Hey!
- Oh my God, oh my God.

316
00:20:23,196 --> 00:20:24,919
Run run run run!

317
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:28,986
I see you.

318
00:20:57,308 --> 00:20:59,991
Hey! Hey!
Holy shoulder!

319
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:01,237
Hey.

320
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:03,576
Are these yours?

321
00:21:07,035 --> 00:21:08,922
There you go.
You can have those back.

322
00:21:08,954 --> 00:21:10,744
Let me ask you
a question.

323
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:14,194
Does that look like a church back there?
'Cause it's not.

324
00:21:14,235 --> 00:21:16,439
It's my house.
It's private property.

325
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,744
And I don't want you four
wandering around back there

326
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,535
when I'm not home
with a bunch of candles

327
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,938
doing whatever it is
that those things do. Okay?

328
00:21:22,971 --> 00:21:25,240
And you're gonna put
paint on my wall?

329
00:21:25,274 --> 00:21:27,544
All right?
That's vandalism.

330
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,269
- Got it?
- Please. Please, Mr. Poole.

331
00:21:29,307 --> 00:21:32,983
Calm. We didn't paint
anything on your wall.

332
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:34,263
- Really?
- Really.

333
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:35,542
- No, nothing?
- No no no...

334
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:37,007
Okay, so what's that?

335
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,255
Wanna tell me
what that is?

336
00:21:42,171 --> 00:21:43,894
Oh my God.

337
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:47,192
That's not paint,
Mr. Poole.

338
00:21:47,226 --> 00:21:49,911
And we did not
put it there.

339
00:21:49,947 --> 00:21:51,321
So what is it?

340
00:21:51,356 --> 00:21:53,940
It's blood.

341
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,866
- Oh...
- It's the holy blood.

342
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,459
- Blood?
- Yes.

343
00:21:57,498 --> 00:21:59,321
Okay.

344
00:21:59,355 --> 00:22:01,908
- Oh my God.
- Let me tell you something.

345
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,761
All three of you are
old enough to know better

346
00:22:04,795 --> 00:22:07,097
and I'm especially
disappointed in you.

347
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:13,274
Sick of it.

348
00:22:13,307 --> 00:22:16,339
Please just leave me alone,
all right?

349
00:22:17,498 --> 00:22:18,775
Blood.

350
00:22:32,698 --> 00:22:34,706
# Whoo hoo #

351
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,780
# Whoo hoo #

352
00:22:39,546 --> 00:22:41,204
# Whoo hoo #

353
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:44,472
# Whoo hoo #

354
00:22:46,554 --> 00:22:48,015
# I got my head checked #

355
00:22:49,754 --> 00:22:52,056
# By a jumbo jet #

356
00:22:53,658 --> 00:22:55,895
# It wasn't easy #

357
00:22:57,274 --> 00:22:59,576
# But nothing is #

358
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,625
# No #

359
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,422
# Whoo hoo #

360
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,596
# When I feel heavy metal #

361
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,194
# Whoo hoo #

362
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:08,177
# And I'm pins
and I'm needles #

363
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:09,625
# Whoo hoo #

364
00:23:09,658 --> 00:23:11,796
# Well, I lie
and I'm easy #

365
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:14,681
# All of the time but
I'm never sure #

366
00:23:14,713 --> 00:23:17,234
# When I need you #

367
00:23:17,273 --> 00:23:20,023
# Pleased to meet you #

368
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,594
# Oh, yeah. #

369
00:23:25,594 --> 00:23:27,863
Thank you.

370
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,465
Ooh! Oops.

371
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:35,024
- "Oops?"
- Sorry.

372
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:37,454
Oh, I missed.

373
00:23:37,497 --> 00:23:38,872
You-- you missed?

374
00:23:38,905 --> 00:23:41,295
Eh, let me just
try again.

375
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,416
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

376
00:23:42,457 --> 00:23:44,083
Okay.

377
00:23:48,057 --> 00:23:50,032
Damn it. Jesus.
Sorry.

378
00:23:50,073 --> 00:23:51,568
- Oh, damn.
- Eh!

379
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,300
You know, seriously,

380
00:23:53,337 --> 00:23:55,247
do you want to go
practice and come back?

381
00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:58,605
Maybe warm up on, like, an orange?
What's the story?

382
00:23:58,648 --> 00:24:01,300
You know, at this point, I'm just like,
"A razor blade and a coffee cup,

383
00:24:01,338 --> 00:24:03,192
I'll do it myself."
You know what I mean?

384
00:24:03,226 --> 00:24:04,600
One more time.

385
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:06,357
It's just--
this is the one.

386
00:24:06,393 --> 00:24:08,532
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

387
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:11,089
Okay, just relax.
Okay?

388
00:24:11,128 --> 00:24:12,787
I feel it.

389
00:24:12,825 --> 00:24:14,167
Okay.

390
00:24:16,569 --> 00:24:18,195
- Ah, got it.
- Got it?

391
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:19,575
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

392
00:24:22,137 --> 00:24:24,342
Ouch! How many times
did she hit you?

393
00:24:24,377 --> 00:24:27,540
Uh, three or four.
I actually kinda lost track.

394
00:24:27,577 --> 00:24:29,465
Three or four, huh?
She's getting better.

395
00:24:29,498 --> 00:24:31,384
She got some practice.

396
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:33,490
Let me just run through
a couple of standard Q and A.

397
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:37,106
- You sleeping okay?
- I could use a little more, yeah.

398
00:24:37,145 --> 00:24:38,574
Diet good?

399
00:24:38,616 --> 00:24:40,143
I eat, yeah.

400
00:24:40,184 --> 00:24:42,072
Exercise?

401
00:24:42,104 --> 00:24:43,698
Uh, you know,
here and there.

402
00:24:43,737 --> 00:24:45,231
So no?

403
00:24:45,273 --> 00:24:46,735
- Well...
- Other than that, Mr. Poole,

404
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,183
you're doing fine.

405
00:24:48,217 --> 00:24:49,940
I'd probably try
a little more exercise.

406
00:24:49,977 --> 00:24:53,238
Maybe some yoga?
Or Pilates?

407
00:24:53,272 --> 00:24:56,306
I'll call you in a few days when
your blood and urine come back.

408
00:25:15,193 --> 00:25:16,655
I can help you
over here.

409
00:25:31,544 --> 00:25:33,749
Hope you're not using
that as a mixer.

410
00:25:33,785 --> 00:25:36,753
- Huh?
- 'Cause you're not getting vodka.

411
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:38,451
Oh, yeah.

412
00:25:40,312 --> 00:25:42,287
Did you know that in 1985,

413
00:25:42,328 --> 00:25:44,946
Gorbachev, right after he became
the party's general secretary,

414
00:25:44,984 --> 00:25:46,894
tried to eradicate
vodka in Russia?

415
00:25:46,937 --> 00:25:48,692
The people wouldn't
have it, though.

416
00:25:48,728 --> 00:25:50,933
Isn't that weird?
I mean...

417
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:53,173
something like 30,000
Russians die a year

418
00:25:53,209 --> 00:25:55,510
from alcohol poisoning,
but the people,

419
00:25:55,545 --> 00:25:56,973
they want what
they want.

420
00:25:57,016 --> 00:25:58,643
Yeah.

421
00:26:12,185 --> 00:26:13,614
What's wrong with you?

422
00:26:14,904 --> 00:26:16,017
Hmm?

423
00:26:16,056 --> 00:26:17,911
Well, I don't mean
to be rude.

424
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:19,352
It's just that...

425
00:26:19,384 --> 00:26:21,009
something is clearly
wrong with you.

426
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:23,023
I don't know if you're sad
or angry or both,

427
00:26:23,064 --> 00:26:25,334
but you're not normal.

428
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:28,946
I thought maybe you might
want to talk about it.

429
00:26:28,984 --> 00:26:33,294
You want me to tell you
why I'm sad and angry

430
00:26:33,336 --> 00:26:35,245
while you're ringing up
my bottles of bleach?

431
00:26:35,287 --> 00:26:37,938
So it is both--
sad and angry.

432
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:39,405
- I didn't say that.
- Yes, you did.

433
00:26:39,448 --> 00:26:41,009
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

434
00:26:41,048 --> 00:26:42,705
I was indulging you.

435
00:26:42,744 --> 00:26:44,532
Okay? I was being polite.

436
00:26:44,568 --> 00:26:48,146
Okay, indulge me
some more.

437
00:26:48,183 --> 00:26:51,413
- Tell me what's wrong.
- Why don't you just ring my stuff up,

438
00:26:51,447 --> 00:26:53,389
all right? Jesus.

439
00:26:53,432 --> 00:26:54,892
I mean, I appreciate
your concern,

440
00:26:54,935 --> 00:26:56,845
but I'd just like to
get out of here.

441
00:26:56,888 --> 00:26:58,383
- All right?
- Okay.

442
00:27:01,848 --> 00:27:03,157
I'm sorry I asked.

443
00:27:03,192 --> 00:27:04,500
Don't be.

444
00:27:13,272 --> 00:27:15,247
It's okay to be sad,
you know.

445
00:27:15,288 --> 00:27:18,671
I mean, I've been
really sad before.

446
00:27:18,712 --> 00:27:20,599
Sometimes...

447
00:27:20,632 --> 00:27:23,730
you have to be sad to remind
yourself that you're alive.

448
00:27:25,431 --> 00:27:27,504
Better than feeling
nothing, right?

449
00:27:42,424 --> 00:27:44,911
It's not coming off, huh?

450
00:27:44,951 --> 00:27:46,130
No.

451
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,305
No, it isn't.

452
00:27:48,343 --> 00:27:52,271
I, uh, think I might have
even made it worse.

453
00:27:52,312 --> 00:27:55,791
You, uh, you got
any suggestions?

454
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,679
Um, no.

455
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:01,100
But if it's what
Esperanza says it is,

456
00:28:01,143 --> 00:28:04,492
then I guess it's gonna take a little
bit more than a bottle of bleach.

457
00:28:04,535 --> 00:28:08,048
Yeah, well,
Esperanza's wrong.

458
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:11,403
So you aren't in
so much doubt.

459
00:28:11,446 --> 00:28:15,571
You really think that's
the face of Christ?

460
00:28:15,608 --> 00:28:17,494
Actually,

461
00:28:17,527 --> 00:28:19,796
from this angle, it looks
a little bit like you.

462
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:23,791
I mean,
an abstract version.

463
00:28:23,831 --> 00:28:25,871
I guess.

464
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,885
It's just a stain.

465
00:28:27,926 --> 00:28:29,902
It's a bad stain.

466
00:28:29,943 --> 00:28:31,372
Well, if you can't
get it off,

467
00:28:31,415 --> 00:28:33,138
I guess it'll be something
to remember you by.

468
00:28:33,174 --> 00:28:34,865
What?

469
00:28:34,903 --> 00:28:36,791
Well, you're not gonna
live here that long, right?

470
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:42,993
Esperanza, she's like the local
newspaper around here.

471
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:45,649
I think she cornered
the real estate agent

472
00:28:45,686 --> 00:28:48,849
and so we got
the lowdown on you.

473
00:28:48,886 --> 00:28:51,221
Oh. Yeah.

474
00:28:51,254 --> 00:28:55,029
So-- so what are you doing? Buying it,
selling it and making a profit?

475
00:28:55,062 --> 00:28:58,412
Yeah.

476
00:28:58,455 --> 00:29:00,177
Yeah, something like that.

477
00:29:00,215 --> 00:29:03,248
Well, don't sell it
to any weirdoes, okay?

478
00:29:03,286 --> 00:29:05,424
No.

479
00:29:05,462 --> 00:29:07,731
I won't.

480
00:29:07,766 --> 00:29:10,831
Okay, well,
good luck with the face.

481
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,212
Thanks.

482
00:29:12,246 --> 00:29:13,741
Or whatever it is.

483
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:59,472
Listen to me.
The man is clearly an atheist.

484
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:02,095
And he's not very nice.

485
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,785
The two go hand in hand.

486
00:30:04,822 --> 00:30:07,539
Well, those without faith

487
00:30:07,574 --> 00:30:09,396
sometimes need a little help.

488
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,542
That's it.

489
00:30:10,582 --> 00:30:13,200
Psst, psst.

490
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:19,245
Now what are you doing?

491
00:30:19,286 --> 00:30:22,515
- Your lawn is so sloopy.
- Sloopy?

492
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:24,819
- Yeah.
- Look, this is ridiculous.

493
00:30:24,854 --> 00:30:27,985
Okay, people just don't go around
helping one another for no reason,

494
00:30:28,021 --> 00:30:30,542
so just tell me
what it is you're doing.

495
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,491
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything.

496
00:30:32,535 --> 00:30:34,290
Just tell him.
Just ask him.

497
00:30:34,325 --> 00:30:36,365
Ask me what?

498
00:30:37,653 --> 00:30:39,311
She wants to bring
the church in

499
00:30:39,349 --> 00:30:41,172
to test the face
in your backyard,

500
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,547
to see if it's a miracle.

501
00:30:42,581 --> 00:30:43,955
You've got to
be kidding me.

502
00:30:43,989 --> 00:30:45,932
Nope. She's crafty like that.

503
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:47,796
- Aren't you?
- Yeah.

504
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,797
I didn't catch your name,
but anyways...

505
00:30:53,654 --> 00:30:55,312
Listen to me, okay?

506
00:30:55,349 --> 00:30:58,416
You can build me
a goddamn gazebo back there

507
00:30:58,454 --> 00:31:01,137
and I still wouldn't let you
and your crazy church friends

508
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:03,246
into my house. All right?

509
00:31:03,285 --> 00:31:07,246
So that face, whatever
you happen to think it is,

510
00:31:07,285 --> 00:31:09,391
is a stain.

511
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,990
It's not a miracle.

512
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:12,436
Okay?

513
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:14,770
How can you say that?

514
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,325
Look, I really don't want
to talk about it,

515
00:31:17,365 --> 00:31:19,023
so I just came out here
to give you that.

516
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:21,298
I just found it, so...

517
00:31:23,061 --> 00:31:24,817
Oh my God.

518
00:31:24,852 --> 00:31:26,992
Why did you have to
go and do that?

519
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:30,192
Um, why are you crying?
I just-- I'm sorry.

520
00:31:30,229 --> 00:31:31,985
I just found that.

521
00:31:32,021 --> 00:31:33,776
That's Leo.

522
00:31:33,813 --> 00:31:36,530
He was her boyfriend
before he died.

523
00:31:36,564 --> 00:31:38,452
He lived in your house.

524
00:31:38,484 --> 00:31:40,273
He was such a good man.

525
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:43,570
Well, look, there's
a cigar box full of them under the sink,

526
00:31:43,605 --> 00:31:45,971
so you can come by
and get 'em when you want 'em.

527
00:31:53,942 --> 00:31:56,363
He was so handsome.

528
00:31:57,812 --> 00:32:01,009
I-- I never thought
I'd find someone like him.

529
00:32:02,292 --> 00:32:04,681
I-- I was ready to--

530
00:32:04,725 --> 00:32:07,539
to just be old alone.

531
00:32:07,573 --> 00:32:10,421
I never married.

532
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,287
Never found anyone.

533
00:32:14,325 --> 00:32:17,139
Then one day,

534
00:32:17,172 --> 00:32:19,857
three years ago or so,

535
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:24,078
Leo came here.

536
00:32:26,325 --> 00:32:28,113
And that was it.

537
00:32:28,148 --> 00:32:31,051
Years of being alone

538
00:32:31,092 --> 00:32:33,263
and one minute...

539
00:32:36,564 --> 00:32:38,801
manages to take it all away.

540
00:32:41,108 --> 00:32:43,727
A lifetime of sadness and...

541
00:32:43,764 --> 00:32:46,350
suddenly

542
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:49,705
I couldn't even remember

543
00:32:49,748 --> 00:32:53,294
what it was like to be sad.

544
00:32:59,829 --> 00:33:01,454
And  then   he  died.

545
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:07,859
And I remember.

546
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:13,139
And...

547
00:33:15,348 --> 00:33:17,387
I pray to God

548
00:33:17,427 --> 00:33:19,566
to help me stop

549
00:33:19,604 --> 00:33:21,677
feeling that pain

550
00:33:23,091 --> 00:33:25,547
and let me know

551
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:27,977
that he was okay.

552
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:33,266
And now...

553
00:33:35,828 --> 00:33:37,966
the face appears--

554
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,965
the face of God.

555
00:33:50,804 --> 00:33:52,364
Look,

556
00:33:52,404 --> 00:33:55,087
Esperanza...

557
00:33:57,139 --> 00:33:59,409
I want you to be
very honest with me.

558
00:33:59,444 --> 00:34:00,873
Okay?

559
00:34:02,324 --> 00:34:06,601
You really think that
that stain out there

560
00:34:06,643 --> 00:34:09,131
is the answer
to all your prayers?

561
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:11,212
Do you?

562
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:20,077
So what exactly is it that
you want the church to do?

563
00:34:21,812 --> 00:34:24,746
Just come and test
the wall.

564
00:34:24,787 --> 00:34:26,991
Test the blood.

565
00:34:27,028 --> 00:34:29,777
And to see what it is.

566
00:34:29,812 --> 00:34:33,074
And if it's nothing,
then it's nothing

567
00:34:33,107 --> 00:34:36,456
and I won't
bother you again.

568
00:34:36,499 --> 00:34:38,572
I promise, really.

569
00:34:40,498 --> 00:34:42,158
Um...

570
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:47,180
All  right.

571
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,067
Just one day.
That's it.

572
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,488
I mean it.
One day.

573
00:34:53,683 --> 00:34:55,090
Thank you, Mr. Poole.

574
00:34:55,124 --> 00:34:56,650
Thank you.

575
00:34:56,691 --> 00:34:58,120
You're welcome.

576
00:34:58,163 --> 00:34:59,340
Thank you.

577
00:34:59,379 --> 00:35:01,167
You'll see.
You'll see.

578
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:06,451
Everything happens
for a reason.

579
00:35:15,091 --> 00:35:18,864
Esperanza,
llevelo al dentro.

580
00:35:18,898 --> 00:35:21,550
- Gracias.
- Who's that guy?

581
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:24,848
He has to open up the wall and look
at what's behind the stain

582
00:35:24,883 --> 00:35:26,989
to be sure it's not
man-made.

583
00:35:27,027 --> 00:35:29,328
We'll repair it.
It'll look as good as new. Don't worry.

584
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:31,697
No, don't repair it.
It's okay.

585
00:35:31,731 --> 00:35:34,665
Don't be silly, Mr. Poole. We're not
gonna leave a hole in the wall.

586
00:35:34,706 --> 00:35:36,746
Doesn't matter.

587
00:35:36,786 --> 00:35:38,926
I'm not gonna be here
that long.

588
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,972
You know, Father Salizar,
the house was re-stuccoed

589
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,466
before I moved in,
so that's it.

590
00:35:55,507 --> 00:35:57,808
There's really not
a lot to talk about.

591
00:36:00,338 --> 00:36:02,280
Maybe not about the house.

592
00:36:02,322 --> 00:36:05,770
Why did you say you were
not gonna be here that long?

593
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,898
I don't really want
to talk about it.

594
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:11,051
Oh, yeah, you do.

595
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,261
Oh, I do?

596
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:15,054
Otherwise you wouldn't
have mentioned it.

597
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,959
Let me ask you
a question.

598
00:36:21,522 --> 00:36:24,424
What makes you think
you know me that well?

599
00:36:24,465 --> 00:36:26,288
I don't think that.

600
00:36:26,323 --> 00:36:29,454
I just think anybody with two eyes
could see that something is wrong,

601
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:32,786
- like you're--
- Sad and angry?

602
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:34,891
Yeah.

603
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,523
Something like that.

604
00:36:36,562 --> 00:36:37,970
Yeah.

605
00:36:38,002 --> 00:36:40,936
I'm a good listener.

606
00:36:40,978 --> 00:36:43,826
Yeah? Me too.

607
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:11,145
I just think anybody with two eyes

608
00:37:11,186 --> 00:37:12,746
could see that something
is wrong.

609
00:37:12,785 --> 00:37:16,398
- Like you're--
- Sad and angry?

610
00:37:18,225 --> 00:37:20,298
Yeah.

611
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:21,582
Something like that.

612
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:29,163
I just think anybody
with two eyes

613
00:37:29,201 --> 00:37:30,696
could see that something
is wrong,

614
00:37:30,738 --> 00:37:34,599
- like you're--
- Sad and angry?

615
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:37,711
Yeah.

616
00:37:37,746 --> 00:37:39,534
Something like that.

617
00:37:56,242 --> 00:37:58,129
What are you doing
in there?

618
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:29,292
Wow.

619
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:32,874
You really like
this place.

620
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,095
You don't talk,
do you, Millie?

621
00:38:52,976 --> 00:38:54,438
It's okay.

622
00:38:54,481 --> 00:38:58,921
Sometimes I don't like
to talk either.

623
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,685
You know?

624
00:39:07,217 --> 00:39:09,005
I ought to go.

625
00:39:10,577 --> 00:39:12,432
Okay?

626
00:39:12,465 --> 00:39:15,661
I'd love to sit here and visit
with you, but I just can't.

627
00:39:17,937 --> 00:39:21,930
I got a pretty long journey
ahead of me.

628
00:39:23,185 --> 00:39:25,454
I wish I could stay
and talk with you.

629
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:27,758
I just don't have
the time.

630
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,749
Mr. Poole? Uh...

631
00:40:00,785 --> 00:40:03,501
I-- I'm sorry.
I rang the bell, but--

632
00:40:03,536 --> 00:40:07,815
Well, I have something
for you.

633
00:40:17,136 --> 00:40:19,175
How'd you know
this was the one?

634
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:21,867
I know everything
about this neighborhood.

635
00:40:21,904 --> 00:40:24,294
You should know that
by now.

636
00:40:39,888 --> 00:40:42,124
This used to be my room.

637
00:40:43,504 --> 00:40:45,064
Mr. Poole, are you okay?

638
00:40:45,104 --> 00:40:47,657
This used to be my room.

639
00:40:49,743 --> 00:40:52,842
This is the last place
I remember being happy.

640
00:40:55,568 --> 00:40:57,804
Even then
I can barely remember.

641
00:41:14,447 --> 00:41:18,125
This is the room where they
used to scream at each other.

642
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,687
Mmm.

643
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:34,983
It's a strange thing
about standing here again.

644
00:41:35,024 --> 00:41:39,595
It's doing absolutely nothing
for me, you know?

645
00:41:42,863 --> 00:41:44,424
Mr. Poole,

646
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:47,692
I'm sorry it wasn't
what you hoped.

647
00:41:47,726 --> 00:41:49,155
Don't be.

648
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:50,922
It never is.

649
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:52,781
But thank you.

650
00:41:52,815 --> 00:41:54,757
This was very generous.

651
00:41:54,798 --> 00:41:56,293
- Mmm.
- Thanks.

652
00:41:57,775 --> 00:41:59,630
What did you expect?

653
00:41:59,663 --> 00:42:02,052
You can't go to the past
to fix the present.

654
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:06,663
You sound like
a fortune cookie.

655
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:10,600
Cookies don't talk.

656
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:12,909
Now--

657
00:42:12,943 --> 00:42:15,310
at least now you know.

658
00:42:15,343 --> 00:42:17,961
Know what?

659
00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:22,188
To come back to
the place you grew up.

660
00:42:22,223 --> 00:42:24,296
Yeah.

661
00:42:24,335 --> 00:42:25,960
Now I know.

662
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:30,124
It's like nothing.

663
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,494
You find out
there's nowhere to hide.

664
00:42:34,479 --> 00:42:38,123
# Shadows are falling #

665
00:42:38,158 --> 00:42:41,126
# And I been here
all day #

666
00:42:43,918 --> 00:42:47,333
# It's too hot to sleep #

667
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:50,222
# And time is
running away #

668
00:42:53,486 --> 00:42:55,690
# I feel like my soul has #

669
00:42:55,727 --> 00:42:58,858
# Turned into steel #

670
00:43:01,966 --> 00:43:04,105
# I've still got the scars #

671
00:43:04,142 --> 00:43:07,918
# That the sun
didn't heal #

672
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:14,758
# There's not even
room enough #

673
00:43:14,798 --> 00:43:17,580
# To be anywhere #

674
00:43:20,686 --> 00:43:23,785
# It's not dark yet #

675
00:43:23,823 --> 00:43:26,211
# But it's gettin' there. #

676
00:43:50,574 --> 00:43:51,589
Millie?

677
00:43:54,734 --> 00:43:56,458
Hey.

678
00:43:58,382 --> 00:44:01,001
Come out, honey.
It's too late to be playing games.

679
00:44:07,885 --> 00:44:09,772
Where are you, Millie?

680
00:44:11,246 --> 00:44:13,188
Where are you, Millie?

681
00:44:17,997 --> 00:44:19,492
Millie?

682
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:31,428
Millie?

683
00:44:53,421 --> 00:44:55,047
Millie?

684
00:44:55,085 --> 00:44:56,995
What are you doing?

685
00:45:01,773 --> 00:45:03,399
Honey?

686
00:45:08,877 --> 00:45:10,764
Hey, Millie.

687
00:45:18,701 --> 00:45:20,228
Millie.

688
00:45:21,645 --> 00:45:23,239
Hey.

689
00:45:25,197 --> 00:45:27,052
What is it?

690
00:45:30,222 --> 00:45:32,523
Hey, what did you say?

691
00:45:33,485 --> 00:45:35,657
What?

692
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:37,286
Hey.

693
00:45:41,517 --> 00:45:43,109
What did you say?

694
00:45:46,606 --> 00:45:48,132
Mama.

695
00:45:49,644 --> 00:45:52,940
Mommy?
Can you hear me?

696
00:45:52,974 --> 00:45:54,882
We're okay.

697
00:45:54,924 --> 00:45:57,795
I love you so so much.

698
00:46:00,012 --> 00:46:02,249
I'm sorry.

699
00:46:03,982 --> 00:46:06,086
I'm so sorry, baby.

700
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:08,426
I'm sorry.

701
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:10,086
Mommy's here.

702
00:46:10,124 --> 00:46:12,514
Mommy's right here.

703
00:46:13,934 --> 00:46:16,583
Come on.
Let's go.

704
00:46:16,621 --> 00:46:19,370
Hey, let's go home.

705
00:46:46,381 --> 00:46:47,691
Thanks.

706
00:46:52,461 --> 00:46:54,532
What happened out there?

707
00:46:57,837 --> 00:46:59,745
You tell me.

708
00:47:01,036 --> 00:47:04,265
She hasn't said a word
in over a year,

709
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,187
ever since her father left.

710
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:09,035
I mean, she loved him
so much.

711
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:12,517
And it's just been...

712
00:47:12,555 --> 00:47:14,443
so unfair for her.

713
00:47:14,476 --> 00:47:17,923
I mean, l-- I couldn't
even get her out of bed

714
00:47:17,963 --> 00:47:20,135
when this
whole thing started.

715
00:47:20,172 --> 00:47:23,969
She just kind of
turned inside herself

716
00:47:24,012 --> 00:47:27,525
and couldn't find
her way out.

717
00:47:27,564 --> 00:47:30,498
I took to every kind
of doctor-- therapists,

718
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,329
psychologists,

719
00:47:32,363 --> 00:47:36,586
psychiatrists, and pretty much
everyone-- nothing.

720
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:40,416
They'd just run down the list--
depression, post-traumatic

721
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,728
whatever--

722
00:47:42,764 --> 00:47:45,098
abandonment.

723
00:47:45,132 --> 00:47:48,328
And after a while,
she got a little better,

724
00:47:48,363 --> 00:47:51,364
but she just
wouldn't talk.

725
00:47:51,404 --> 00:47:54,087
Maybe she just didn't
have anything to say.

726
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:56,131
Maybe she wasn't ready
until now.

727
00:47:56,171 --> 00:48:00,099
Maybe. But she touched
that wall and she--

728
00:48:00,139 --> 00:48:02,561
You think she spoke because
she touched the wall?

729
00:48:02,603 --> 00:48:04,610
No, I'm not saying that,
but that's what happened.

730
00:48:04,651 --> 00:48:08,645
I mean, she touched it
and she talked.

731
00:48:08,684 --> 00:48:11,236
And I'm just praying
that it stays that way.

732
00:48:11,274 --> 00:48:14,537
Dawn, I think it's great
that Millie spoke.

733
00:48:16,522 --> 00:48:18,433
But I think you
should realize

734
00:48:18,476 --> 00:48:20,647
it was a completely
random event.

735
00:48:20,684 --> 00:48:23,716
Things just-- they don't
happen like that in real life.

736
00:48:23,755 --> 00:48:27,170
I mean, if they did,
then I wouldn't--

737
00:48:27,211 --> 00:48:29,000
You wouldn't what?

738
00:48:32,234 --> 00:48:35,748
Ever feel like things
just happen for no reason?

739
00:48:37,995 --> 00:48:40,929
That you're just kind of
going along for the ride

740
00:48:40,971 --> 00:48:44,321
and there's just
nothing you can do?

741
00:48:50,603 --> 00:48:53,059
I need to
tell you something.

742
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,303
What?

743
00:48:55,339 --> 00:48:58,860
I want to tell you so that
I'm not the only one that knows.

744
00:48:59,498 --> 00:49:01,888
Henry, this is so unheard of
here in the States.

745
00:49:01,931 --> 00:49:04,649
I mean, it happens.

746
00:49:04,683 --> 00:49:08,392
- But this disease--
- Disease?

747
00:49:12,139 --> 00:49:14,889
It steamrolls
through the system.

748
00:49:17,258 --> 00:49:19,680
Stopping it at this point...

749
00:49:23,563 --> 00:49:25,319
You're saying
I'm gonna die.

750
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:28,778
Yes.

751
00:50:48,202 --> 00:50:50,176
Mr. Poole.
Mr. Poole,

752
00:50:50,218 --> 00:50:52,586
are you okay?
Mr. Poole?

753
00:50:52,618 --> 00:50:56,196
Sorry.
The door was open.

754
00:50:56,233 --> 00:50:59,397
That doesn't mean you can
just walk through it.

755
00:50:59,434 --> 00:51:01,091
I need to talk to you.

756
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:03,520
No. No, you don't, actually,

757
00:51:03,562 --> 00:51:06,660
'cause I know exactly
what you're gonna say.

758
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:10,080
No, you don't exactly.

759
00:51:10,122 --> 00:51:13,952
So I guess you heard
what happened last night.

760
00:51:15,081 --> 00:51:17,056
Now you think
that little girl spoke

761
00:51:17,098 --> 00:51:19,367
because she touched
the wall?

762
00:51:19,402 --> 00:51:22,598
And now we're all supposed to believe
that the Second Coming's happening

763
00:51:22,633 --> 00:51:24,739
in my backyard.

764
00:51:24,778 --> 00:51:27,396
And the next thing you know,
this whole goddamn street--

765
00:51:27,433 --> 00:51:31,231
sorry-- turns into a carnival
with every holy-roller freak

766
00:51:31,274 --> 00:51:33,695
within a 100-mile radius
lined up around the block

767
00:51:33,737 --> 00:51:37,053
to touch or catch a glimpse
of my stucco job.

768
00:51:37,099 --> 00:51:40,513
Well, it's not gonna happen.

769
00:51:40,553 --> 00:51:42,823
And in no way did Millie
finally speaking

770
00:51:42,858 --> 00:51:44,963
have anything to do
with her touching the wall,

771
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:46,976
and you know that.

772
00:51:47,017 --> 00:51:50,977
And God only knows-- and I use
the phrase very loosely, believe me--

773
00:51:51,017 --> 00:51:54,083
who knows what it was that caused her
to get up at 3:00 in the morning

774
00:51:54,122 --> 00:51:56,510
and wander over here
and start palming the wall

775
00:51:56,553 --> 00:51:58,278
Iike her life
depended on it?

776
00:51:58,314 --> 00:52:00,287
- It was me.
- What was you?

777
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:03,329
I told her the wall would
take away her suffering

778
00:52:03,369 --> 00:52:05,638
if-- if she just had faith.

779
00:52:05,673 --> 00:52:07,080
Why would you do that?

780
00:52:07,113 --> 00:52:08,837
- It worked, no?
- No.

781
00:52:08,873 --> 00:52:11,557
She worked. Maybe your
insane pep talk got to her,

782
00:52:11,593 --> 00:52:13,284
but she got here
on her own.

783
00:52:13,321 --> 00:52:16,322
Why it's so hard
for you to believe

784
00:52:16,362 --> 00:52:18,500
that something like this
could happen?

785
00:52:18,537 --> 00:52:20,480
Why is it so important
to you that I believe

786
00:52:20,521 --> 00:52:22,113
that something like that
could happen?

787
00:52:22,152 --> 00:52:24,007
- Because it--
- Because I'll tell you.

788
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:27,304
Because if you can convince me,
then suddenly your beliefs

789
00:52:27,337 --> 00:52:29,541
become more real. Right?

790
00:52:29,577 --> 00:52:32,926
The more people you can get to
jump on your God's-on-the-wall train,

791
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:35,009
the more your mission's made.
So until you get me

792
00:52:35,049 --> 00:52:37,537
to swallow your world
and believe what you believe,

793
00:52:37,578 --> 00:52:40,130
you'll never have the kind
of faith you want to have.

794
00:52:40,168 --> 00:52:42,503
You'll always have
a little bit of doubt.

795
00:52:42,537 --> 00:52:45,155
You'll-- you'll never
know if you're quite right.

796
00:52:45,193 --> 00:52:47,167
You'll always kind of
be wondering if it's real.

797
00:52:47,209 --> 00:52:50,056
You'll always be sitting over
there waiting for that man

798
00:52:50,089 --> 00:52:52,193
to come waltzing back
in from the dead.

799
00:52:54,153 --> 00:52:56,803
And that's sad.

800
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,044
That's really sad.

801
00:52:59,081 --> 00:53:03,304
I'm just trying
to help.

802
00:53:03,337 --> 00:53:04,832
Just like that.

803
00:53:04,873 --> 00:53:06,213
Yeah?

804
00:53:13,832 --> 00:53:15,077
Esp--

805
00:53:16,073 --> 00:53:17,730
Esperanza?

806
00:53:51,049 --> 00:53:52,805
- Hey.
- Hey.

807
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,709
How you doin'?

808
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,429
I'm good.

809
00:53:58,472 --> 00:54:00,098
Just getting some air.

810
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:01,959
I just wanted
to thank you

811
00:54:01,992 --> 00:54:04,894
for helping me
with Millie last night.

812
00:54:04,936 --> 00:54:06,758
So...

813
00:54:06,792 --> 00:54:08,352
I made you some cookies.

814
00:54:08,392 --> 00:54:10,759
Thank you.

815
00:54:10,793 --> 00:54:13,312
It was Millie's idea.

816
00:54:15,432 --> 00:54:18,115
- How is she doing?
- She's really good.

817
00:54:18,151 --> 00:54:21,568
I'm just praying
that it stays that way.

818
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:27,047
You wanna go
for a walk?

819
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,349
Yeah.

820
00:54:33,831 --> 00:54:37,607
Mmm, just came out of the oven,
like, 10 minutes ago.

821
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:42,080
# Her fingers touch
upon my lips #

822
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,917
# It's a morning yearning #

823
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,638
# It's a morning
yearning #

824
00:54:49,672 --> 00:54:51,940
#  Pullthe  curtains  shut #

825
00:54:51,976 --> 00:54:54,660
# And try to keep it dark #

826
00:54:54,696 --> 00:54:58,438
# But the  sun   is   burning #

827
00:54:58,472 --> 00:55:02,781
#The sun   is   burning #

828
00:55:14,567 --> 00:55:18,845
# Baby crying kept us
up all night #

829
00:55:18,887 --> 00:55:22,816
# With her morning yearning #

830
00:55:22,855 --> 00:55:27,493
# With her
morning yearning #

831
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:34,973
# Morning yearning... #

832
00:55:35,015 --> 00:55:38,180
I just wish I could tell you that
everything was gonna be all right.

833
00:55:38,216 --> 00:55:39,906
That's okay.

834
00:55:52,967 --> 00:55:55,106
Now what?

835
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:01,380
Now I go home.

836
00:56:01,414 --> 00:56:03,520
And  then...

837
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:05,632
I wish I didn't.

838
00:56:15,175 --> 00:56:17,727
# Like a summer rose #

839
00:56:17,766 --> 00:56:20,517
# I'm  a victim   of the  fall #

840
00:56:20,551 --> 00:56:25,057
# But am soon returning #

841
00:56:25,095 --> 00:56:28,128
# Soon returning #

842
00:56:28,167 --> 00:56:32,771
# Your love's the warmest
place the sun ever shines #

843
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:36,734
# My morning yearning #

844
00:56:36,775 --> 00:56:41,182
# My morning
yearning. #

845
00:56:54,247 --> 00:56:56,516
My God.

846
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:58,787
Dear God.

847
00:57:16,839 --> 00:57:18,464
Oh my God.

848
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:23,901
Patience.

849
00:57:25,798 --> 00:57:28,994
What are you doing?
What's going on?

850
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:32,932
Are you-- are you okay?

851
00:57:32,966 --> 00:57:34,340
Yeah.

852
00:57:34,374 --> 00:57:37,921
- What's wrong?
- Nothing is wrong.

853
00:57:37,959 --> 00:57:39,781
Everything is right.

854
00:57:39,815 --> 00:57:41,537
What are you talking about?

855
00:57:41,573 --> 00:57:43,363
I touched the face.

856
00:57:43,399 --> 00:57:47,653
I just put
my hand on it.

857
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:52,893
And my whole body
got all warm.

858
00:57:52,934 --> 00:57:55,519
And then I closed
my eyes.

859
00:57:55,558 --> 00:57:57,729
I saw light everywhere.

860
00:57:59,558 --> 00:58:01,761
I opened them...

861
00:58:08,133 --> 00:58:09,921
and I could see.

862
00:58:21,637 --> 00:58:23,394
I can see.

863
00:58:29,285 --> 00:58:30,976
Look at that.

864
00:58:31,013 --> 00:58:33,502
I can see perfectly.

865
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:39,108
The house numbers,
the license plate.

866
00:58:46,309 --> 00:58:49,408
You know,
this is amazing.

867
00:58:49,446 --> 00:58:51,965
- This is a miracle--
- Don't say that.

868
00:58:52,005 --> 00:58:54,853
What? Miracle?

869
00:58:54,885 --> 00:58:57,919
- Yeah.
- Come on, Mr. Poole,

870
00:58:57,957 --> 00:59:00,030
what else could this be?

871
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:02,207
What?
A coincidence?

872
00:59:02,244 --> 00:59:04,448
I mean, there are
no miracles, Patience.

873
00:59:04,485 --> 00:59:06,395
I don't believe in them.

874
00:59:07,909 --> 00:59:10,047
Imagine that there was
something wrong with you,

875
00:59:10,084 --> 00:59:11,645
Mr. Poole.

876
00:59:11,685 --> 00:59:15,035
And you did this seemingly
meaningless thing,

877
00:59:15,077 --> 00:59:18,426
put your hand
on a wall,

878
00:59:18,468 --> 00:59:20,770
and you were healed.

879
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:30,272
It's okay, Mr. Poole.
You don't have to say anything.

880
00:59:30,308 --> 00:59:32,132
I gotta go.

881
00:59:32,165 --> 00:59:34,052
I gotta go
tell my mom.

882
00:59:36,069 --> 00:59:38,458
This is incredible!

883
00:59:39,653 --> 00:59:40,994
Wow!

884
00:59:43,397 --> 00:59:44,826
Hi.

885
00:59:44,869 --> 00:59:46,112
Hey.

886
00:59:50,917 --> 00:59:53,372
It's getting harder,
isn't it?

887
00:59:53,413 --> 00:59:54,842
What's that?

888
00:59:54,886 --> 00:59:57,568
To pretend this
isn't happening.

889
01:00:28,229 --> 01:00:30,017
Hey!

890
01:00:30,053 --> 01:00:31,296
- Hi.
- You're home.

891
01:00:31,332 --> 01:00:32,826
- Yeah.
- Um...

892
01:00:32,868 --> 01:00:35,355
Millie wants to know if you
want to come over and play.

893
01:00:35,396 --> 01:00:37,284
Really?

894
01:00:37,317 --> 01:00:40,731
Um, I just don't think
I'm up to it.

895
01:00:40,771 --> 01:00:42,429
- Henry...
- I think I'll just stay here.

896
01:00:42,468 --> 01:00:45,786
...are you actually considering
saying no to a six-year-old girl

897
01:00:45,829 --> 01:00:48,828
with actual words coming
out of her little mouth?

898
01:00:51,076 --> 01:00:53,312
Give me a minute.

899
01:00:53,347 --> 01:00:55,203
We'll be in the yard.

900
01:01:03,907 --> 01:01:05,501
Millie?

901
01:01:07,717 --> 01:01:09,089
Dawn?

902
01:01:13,445 --> 01:01:14,753
I got you, Mr. Poole.

903
01:01:14,788 --> 01:01:16,348
Let's get him!

904
01:01:17,956 --> 01:01:20,127
- Get him, Mommy, get him!
- I got him!

905
01:01:20,164 --> 01:01:21,625
Ahhh!

906
01:01:45,572 --> 01:01:47,000
Oh, gosh.

907
01:01:47,044 --> 01:01:49,248
I surrender.
You win.

908
01:01:49,283 --> 01:01:51,193
I surrender.

909
01:01:54,724 --> 01:01:57,212
# A million tears #

910
01:01:57,252 --> 01:01:59,772
# A million codes #

911
01:01:59,811 --> 01:02:02,332
# 1:15 #

912
01:02:02,372 --> 01:02:04,345
# No way to go #

913
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:07,005
# You point your finger #

914
01:02:07,044 --> 01:02:09,377
# To the moon #

915
01:02:09,412 --> 01:02:11,932
# It looks like rain #

916
01:02:11,971 --> 01:02:14,010
# Coming soon #

917
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:16,473
# I figured all #

918
01:02:16,515 --> 01:02:19,134
# My worst fears #

919
01:02:19,172 --> 01:02:23,776
# Believe in
childlike heroes #

920
01:02:23,812 --> 01:02:26,200
# But I don't want to go #

921
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,284
# That way #

922
01:02:28,324 --> 01:02:31,390
# Surrender hope #

923
01:02:31,427 --> 01:02:33,915
# Again #

924
01:02:33,955 --> 01:02:38,210
# I don't want to go
that way #

925
01:02:38,242 --> 01:02:41,275
# Surrender hope #

926
01:02:41,315 --> 01:02:44,130
# And faith #

927
01:02:44,163 --> 01:02:46,072
# Again #

928
01:02:53,571 --> 01:02:56,189
# Your blood, your fire #

929
01:02:56,226 --> 01:02:58,714
# Your kiss good night #

930
01:02:58,755 --> 01:03:01,089
# Your words, sometime #

931
01:03:01,124 --> 01:03:03,840
# They might be mine #

932
01:03:03,874 --> 01:03:08,348
# I feel this love
could cross the sand #

933
01:03:08,388 --> 01:03:12,992
# I want to feel
that way #

934
01:03:18,467 --> 01:03:22,874
# The fire might linger
and fade away #

935
01:03:22,914 --> 01:03:27,224
# The shadows run
from yesterday #

936
01:03:27,266 --> 01:03:30,017
# Like everyone #

937
01:03:30,051 --> 01:03:34,655
# And everything
were memories #

938
01:03:34,691 --> 01:03:37,112
# And then appears #

939
01:03:37,154 --> 01:03:39,838
# Your blood, your fire #

940
01:03:39,875 --> 01:03:42,176
# Your kiss good night #

941
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:44,577
# Your words, sometimes #

942
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:47,163
# They might be mine #

943
01:03:47,203 --> 01:03:51,807
# I feel this love
could cross the sand #

944
01:03:51,843 --> 01:03:55,869
# I want to feel that way #

945
01:03:55,907 --> 01:04:00,762
# Oh, don't make me
feel that way #

946
01:04:00,802 --> 01:04:03,039
# Oh, I want to feel #

947
01:04:03,075 --> 01:04:07,002
# That way #

948
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:10,173
# Oh, I'm breaking through #

949
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:12,828
# These walls of steel #

950
01:04:12,866 --> 01:04:17,471
# Pushing that wall
for something real #

951
01:04:17,506 --> 01:04:21,784
# I'm falling far
and faster still #

952
01:04:21,826 --> 01:04:24,281
# Wake up, wake up #

953
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:28,348
# Wake up,
wake up #

954
01:04:29,571 --> 01:04:31,937
# Wake up, wake up #

955
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:35,801
# Everyone and everything #

956
01:04:35,843 --> 01:04:40,282
# Everyone
and everything. #

957
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,323
-  All right?
- Yeah.

958
01:04:55,363 --> 01:04:56,988
You ready?

959
01:04:57,027 --> 01:04:58,717
- Okay, good.
- Hey!

960
01:04:59,681 --> 01:05:00,958
Hey.

961
01:05:00,994 --> 01:05:02,336
Hi, Mr. Poole.

962
01:05:02,371 --> 01:05:04,344
Hey, there, Millie.

963
01:05:04,385 --> 01:05:06,274
That's a really nice dress.

964
01:05:06,306 --> 01:05:08,728
You look really pretty.

965
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:11,136
You look nervous,
Mr. Poole.

966
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:13,920
Oh, no, I'm-- I'm fine.

967
01:05:13,954 --> 01:05:15,994
I, uh, no.

968
01:05:16,033 --> 01:05:18,041
I'm just a little tired,
that's all.

969
01:05:18,082 --> 01:05:20,569
You kind of wore me
out yesterday.

970
01:05:20,609 --> 01:05:22,398
Um, honey,

971
01:05:22,433 --> 01:05:24,768
do you want to
get in the car?

972
01:05:27,169 --> 01:05:29,920
I wanted to, uh,
return your dish to you.

973
01:05:29,954 --> 01:05:31,328
Oh, thanks.

974
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:33,052
They were really good.
Thanks a lot.

975
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:34,650
Glad you liked them.

976
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:36,958
Really shouldn't eat
so many at once, though.

977
01:05:36,994 --> 01:05:39,033
- Not good for you.
- No, it doesn't matter.

978
01:05:39,072 --> 01:05:41,561
I mean, I'm--
Uh-- no, you're right.

979
01:05:41,602 --> 01:05:43,805
I shouldn't.

980
01:05:43,842 --> 01:05:46,209
Well, listen, l--

981
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:47,965
I was wondering and,
I don't know,

982
01:05:48,001 --> 01:05:49,528
it might seem a little unfair

983
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,326
seeing as how you know
my situation,

984
01:05:51,361 --> 01:05:53,749
but I thought that maybe,

985
01:05:53,793 --> 01:05:55,703
if you were able to get
a sitter and you had the time--

986
01:05:55,745 --> 01:05:57,120
- Yes.
- Really?

987
01:05:57,154 --> 01:05:58,746
Oh. Oh, wait.

988
01:05:58,785 --> 01:06:00,727
- What?
- Can I ask you?

989
01:06:00,769 --> 01:06:03,355
Well, you did just
ask me, didn't you?

990
01:06:03,394 --> 01:06:05,782
No, I mean, really ask you--

991
01:06:05,825 --> 01:06:08,128
to finish asking you.

992
01:06:08,162 --> 01:06:09,307
Okay.

993
01:06:09,345 --> 01:06:11,035
Would you like to
get dinner with me?

994
01:06:11,072 --> 01:06:12,764
I can't.
I'm busy.

995
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,558
- I didn't really want to any--
- No!

996
01:06:14,593 --> 01:06:16,119
Henry, I'm kidding.

997
01:06:16,161 --> 01:06:17,688
I would love to.

998
01:06:17,729 --> 01:06:19,703
- Great.
- What about tomorrow?

999
01:06:19,744 --> 01:06:21,849
It's perfect.

1000
01:06:21,889 --> 01:06:24,824
And it's not unfair
for you to ask.

1001
01:06:24,865 --> 01:06:27,134
Would it be worse
if you didn't?

1002
01:06:27,169 --> 01:06:28,991
Thank you.

1003
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:31,545
Okay, so...

1004
01:06:31,585 --> 01:06:33,472
- Tomorrow.
- Yeah.

1005
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:36,761
Have fun.

1006
01:07:00,288 --> 01:07:03,006
Just this once, okay?

1007
01:07:03,969 --> 01:07:05,278
Okay, I promise.

1008
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:06,840
Whatever you say, Mr. Poole.

1009
01:07:06,881 --> 01:07:08,703
Thank you.

1010
01:07:10,208 --> 01:07:11,703
What's wrong with her?

1011
01:07:11,744 --> 01:07:13,631
Bursitis.

1012
01:07:13,664 --> 01:07:15,519
And what about
the one next to her?

1013
01:07:15,552 --> 01:07:17,146
There's nothing
wrong with her.

1014
01:07:17,185 --> 01:07:19,487
So, preventative?

1015
01:07:19,521 --> 01:07:22,073
Just in case.

1016
01:07:22,112 --> 01:07:24,479
No, is it true that
the man in the red shirt

1017
01:07:24,513 --> 01:07:26,422
just wants to be
a better dancer?

1018
01:07:28,224 --> 01:07:30,232
Ay, Mr. Poole...

1019
01:07:34,561 --> 01:07:37,462
Um, what about you,
Mr. Poole?

1020
01:07:37,504 --> 01:07:40,154
Have you touched
the wall yet?

1021
01:07:41,888 --> 01:07:44,124
No.

1022
01:07:49,344 --> 01:07:51,231
But you will.

1023
01:08:03,521 --> 01:08:04,797
Hey, Henry.

1024
01:08:04,832 --> 01:08:06,872
- Hi.
- It's good to see you.

1025
01:08:06,911 --> 01:08:08,603
Funny.

1026
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,068
It's good to see you too.

1027
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:12,446
Oh, you--
you forgot these.

1028
01:08:12,479 --> 01:08:14,269
I wanted to return
those to you.

1029
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:17,309
Thanks.

1030
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:19,199
Don't really need them, though.

1031
01:08:19,232 --> 01:08:22,167
- Well.
- I guess they'll be a good souvenir

1032
01:08:22,208 --> 01:08:24,477
- of my previous life.
- Yeah.

1033
01:08:25,824 --> 01:08:28,158
So have you talked
to your doctor yet,

1034
01:08:28,192 --> 01:08:30,363
- your eye doctor?
- Not yet.

1035
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,888
90 bucks for him to
tell me I'm 20/20.

1036
01:08:32,928 --> 01:08:34,357
- Yeah.
- I already know that.

1037
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,505
But, I mean, you got to think
about all the write-ups

1038
01:08:36,544 --> 01:08:38,682
in the medical journals. Right?

1039
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:41,087
You're still having
a pretty hard time buying into this,

1040
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:43,061
- aren't you?
- You gotta admit that it's--

1041
01:08:43,103 --> 01:08:45,438
Do you know who
Noam Chomsky is?

1042
01:08:45,472 --> 01:08:47,032
- The writer?
- Yeah.

1043
01:08:47,073 --> 01:08:49,210
He's a linguist too, but...

1044
01:08:49,247 --> 01:08:51,353
once in an interview, he said,

1045
01:08:51,391 --> 01:08:55,482
"When questions of decision,
reason or choice of action arise,

1046
01:08:55,518 --> 01:08:58,519
human science is at a loss."

1047
01:08:58,559 --> 01:09:00,447
You actually believe that?

1048
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:04,025
He meant that not everything
needs an explanation.

1049
01:09:04,063 --> 01:09:05,589
Sometimes things just happen

1050
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:08,631
because we choose
for them to.

1051
01:09:08,671 --> 01:09:11,900
I chose to believe.

1052
01:09:14,304 --> 01:09:15,897
Okay.

1053
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,510
Thanks.

1054
01:09:19,551 --> 01:09:21,339
You're welcome.

1055
01:09:53,823 --> 01:09:55,961
Well, this is about
the loveliest thing

1056
01:09:55,999 --> 01:09:57,657
that I've ever seen.

1057
01:09:59,903 --> 01:10:02,358
I can't wait to see
what's for dinner.

1058
01:10:03,391 --> 01:10:04,950
Pizza!

1059
01:10:05,918 --> 01:10:07,959
Perfect.

1060
01:10:09,888 --> 01:10:13,749
This is-- this is
very romantic, Henry.

1061
01:10:13,791 --> 01:10:16,026
- Thanks.
- Really.

1062
01:10:16,062 --> 01:10:17,885
Plastic utensils.

1063
01:10:17,919 --> 01:10:19,991
Oh, yeah, family heirlooms.

1064
01:10:30,367 --> 01:10:31,993
Can I ask you something?

1065
01:10:32,031 --> 01:10:33,591
Sure.

1066
01:10:33,631 --> 01:10:37,853
The other night,
you came home kinda late and...

1067
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:41,434
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

1068
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:42,900
It's fine.

1069
01:10:44,319 --> 01:10:46,587
You want to know
where I was.

1070
01:10:46,622 --> 01:10:47,833
Yes.

1071
01:10:47,871 --> 01:10:49,277
I can't tell you.

1072
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:53,399
No, l--

1073
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:55,381
I'd just gone for a walk.

1074
01:10:55,422 --> 01:10:58,172
And it's kind of funny

1075
01:10:58,206 --> 01:11:01,948
'cause I'd just left the house
and started walking

1076
01:11:01,982 --> 01:11:05,724
and l-- I don't even think
I really knew where I was going

1077
01:11:05,758 --> 01:11:07,995
till I got there.

1078
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,689
Where did you go?

1079
01:11:09,726 --> 01:11:11,766
The river.

1080
01:11:11,806 --> 01:11:13,911
I, uh--

1081
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:16,765
My parents,
they used to fight a lot.

1082
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:21,242
So I would go down there

1083
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:23,766
and even though it was
such a big place,

1084
01:11:23,806 --> 01:11:28,313
I always-- I always just
kind of felt very safe there.

1085
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:31,962
I'd kind of go there
and hide.

1086
01:11:31,998 --> 01:11:33,852
And that's why...

1087
01:11:33,886 --> 01:11:34,998
I came here.

1088
01:11:39,102 --> 01:11:41,273
So just like that,
you disappeared.

1089
01:11:45,662 --> 01:11:48,957
Since this thing
happened to me,

1090
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:52,186
every morning when I wake up,
the first thing I think about

1091
01:11:52,221 --> 01:11:56,662
is-- I mean, after I figure out
if I'm still actually here or not--

1092
01:11:58,846 --> 01:12:01,147
The first thing I think about
is how much time

1093
01:12:01,182 --> 01:12:02,742
that I have left.

1094
01:12:02,782 --> 01:12:05,051
And all I can really do
is kind of...

1095
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:06,995
wait for the end.

1096
01:12:09,918 --> 01:12:12,219
But this morning
when I woke up...

1097
01:12:14,109 --> 01:12:16,663
the first thing
I thought about was you.

1098
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:20,180
And  Millie.

1099
01:12:22,302 --> 01:12:24,920
I'm just trying
to say that--

1100
01:12:24,957 --> 01:12:28,918
that I'm enjoying this.

1101
01:12:31,006 --> 01:12:34,518
I'm enjoying you
and being around you.

1102
01:12:37,246 --> 01:12:39,132
And  I just--

1103
01:12:39,165 --> 01:12:41,719
it's a surprise
'cause I didn't ever think

1104
01:12:41,758 --> 01:12:43,667
that I'd feel this way.

1105
01:12:51,805 --> 01:12:53,628
Mommy?

1106
01:12:53,662 --> 01:12:56,344
Millie, what are you
doing up?

1107
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:58,836
I can't sleep.

1108
01:12:58,877 --> 01:13:00,764
Where is Esperanza?

1109
01:13:00,797 --> 01:13:02,739
On the couch, snoring.

1110
01:13:02,781 --> 01:13:07,288
Okay, let's go inside.
Um, do me a favor.

1111
01:13:07,325 --> 01:13:09,780
Keep enjoying this.

1112
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:14,170
All right, honey.
Come on.

1113
01:13:14,205 --> 01:13:16,093
Big sack of potatoes, huh?

1114
01:13:16,126 --> 01:13:18,547
What are you doing
up so late, Millie?

1115
01:13:18,589 --> 01:13:20,183
It's a school night.

1116
01:13:27,261 --> 01:13:29,563
Okay, you want Jasper?

1117
01:13:29,597 --> 01:13:30,709
Here he is.

1118
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:32,949
'Night.

1119
01:13:55,644 --> 01:13:57,367
Sorry about that.

1120
01:13:57,405 --> 01:14:00,155
It's like she doesn't want
to miss a thing now that--

1121
01:14:04,829 --> 01:14:07,196
You know...

1122
01:14:08,605 --> 01:14:11,126
I-- I think maybe we should
just call it a night

1123
01:14:11,165 --> 01:14:13,138
because this isn't--

1124
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:15,003
Henry.

1125
01:14:15,037 --> 01:14:17,753
Sorry, this just isn't right.

1126
01:14:17,788 --> 01:14:19,381
What are you talking about?

1127
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:22,236
Just you, me and everything

1128
01:14:22,268 --> 01:14:23,762
all at once.
I just-- I'm sorry.

1129
01:14:23,804 --> 01:14:25,910
Hey, how can you say that?

1130
01:14:29,499 --> 01:14:31,190
Henry.

1131
01:14:34,396 --> 01:14:36,949
I know you're gonna die,

1132
01:14:41,884 --> 01:14:45,112
but all that either of us have

1133
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:46,971
is right now,

1134
01:14:47,005 --> 01:14:51,095
and we should pay
attention to that.

1135
01:15:00,988 --> 01:15:03,191
I am paying attention.

1136
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:07,674
That's the problem.

1137
01:15:13,755 --> 01:15:15,730
I'm sorry.

1138
01:15:21,243 --> 01:15:26,459
# On an ocean white #

1139
01:15:28,476 --> 01:15:33,233
# Of roaring waves #

1140
01:15:35,259 --> 01:15:39,864
# I see your light #

1141
01:15:41,499 --> 01:15:46,769
# And golden face #

1142
01:15:49,339 --> 01:15:53,944
# A precious gift #

1143
01:15:55,068 --> 01:15:59,508
# Of your longing arms #

1144
01:16:01,467 --> 01:16:06,901
# Hurt  me   not #

1145
01:16:06,939 --> 01:16:11,380
# Just sing to me,
my love #

1146
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:17,715
# Ooh ooh #

1147
01:16:20,188 --> 01:16:24,464
# How come so #

1148
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:32,664
# So #

1149
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:41,721
# Sweetly, child,
you sing? #

1150
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:48,182
# And all the joy #

1151
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:51,514
# You bring to me #

1152
01:16:53,467 --> 01:16:57,810
# Goes #

1153
01:17:00,827 --> 01:17:06,042
# Goes our loved
ones home #

1154
01:17:11,195 --> 01:17:13,583
# And I will-- #

1155
01:17:13,626 --> 01:17:16,943
# I will be waiting. #

1156
01:17:28,348 --> 01:17:29,940
Henry!

1157
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:32,400
What's going on?

1158
01:17:32,443 --> 01:17:34,864
- It's Millie.
- What is it?

1159
01:17:35,994 --> 01:17:38,482
She's in here.

1160
01:17:38,523 --> 01:17:40,594
I mean, she's been
like this all morning.

1161
01:17:40,634 --> 01:17:43,634
She won't talk to me.
She won't look at me.

1162
01:17:43,674 --> 01:17:44,852
Nothing.

1163
01:17:54,459 --> 01:17:56,281
Millie?

1164
01:17:56,314 --> 01:17:58,256
Can you hear me?

1165
01:18:00,154 --> 01:18:02,390
Millie, you remember how
much fun we had the other day

1166
01:18:02,425 --> 01:18:04,150
when we played?

1167
01:18:04,186 --> 01:18:06,074
You remember that?

1168
01:18:08,538 --> 01:18:11,256
Please.
Please say something.

1169
01:18:22,395 --> 01:18:25,590
Henry's here.
He came over to play.

1170
01:18:25,626 --> 01:18:28,922
Sweetie?

1171
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,475
Honey,
can you hear me?

1172
01:18:45,946 --> 01:18:49,841
Henry, I know you're gonna die,

1173
01:18:49,882 --> 01:18:54,104
but all that either of us
have is right now.

1174
01:18:56,314 --> 01:18:58,550
And we should pay
attention to that.

1175
01:19:07,066 --> 01:19:08,756
Was there any kind
of trauma?

1176
01:19:08,794 --> 01:19:11,991
Anything which could have
set her back like this?

1177
01:20:01,786 --> 01:20:03,672
You told me "one time."

1178
01:20:03,705 --> 01:20:05,265
You promised me.

1179
01:20:05,305 --> 01:20:07,988
Mr. Poole, God is
bigger than a promise.

1180
01:20:08,024 --> 01:20:09,748
Just let me talk to you, yes?

1181
01:20:09,784 --> 01:20:11,311
- Esperanza, please, let him go.
- No no no!

1182
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:12,597
- Mr. Poole, just let us--
- Listen to me, please.

1183
01:20:12,634 --> 01:20:14,837
Listen to me!
Mr. Poole.

1184
01:20:17,816 --> 01:20:19,343
- Holy shit.
- No no no no.

1185
01:20:19,384 --> 01:20:22,734
No "holy shit." No "holy shit."
Holy-- something else.

1186
01:20:22,777 --> 01:20:25,078
Mr. Poole,
the test came back.

1187
01:20:25,113 --> 01:20:27,448
Yeah, and what? And what?
There's no explanation for it, right?

1188
01:20:27,481 --> 01:20:28,888
- No.
- It's a big surprise, huh?

1189
01:20:28,922 --> 01:20:30,482
- No no, please--
- Yes, you're right.

1190
01:20:30,521 --> 01:20:32,277
There is no explanation.
That's exactly right.

1191
01:20:32,313 --> 01:20:33,775
You want to tell me
what's going on?

1192
01:20:33,817 --> 01:20:35,956
Why all these people
are here? Huh?

1193
01:20:35,993 --> 01:20:37,749
There here to see
something unexplainable.

1194
01:20:37,785 --> 01:20:39,508
- Yeah?
- They're here to find some hope.

1195
01:20:39,544 --> 01:20:40,821
Let me tell you something--

1196
01:20:40,856 --> 01:20:42,830
I never should have let you
come here in the first place

1197
01:20:42,873 --> 01:20:44,662
'cause this is insane.
You got people praying to the wall.

1198
01:20:44,697 --> 01:20:46,703
- Excuse me, is this your house?
- Yeah!

1199
01:20:46,744 --> 01:20:49,079
- This is my house.
- You know, you're a very lucky man

1200
01:20:49,112 --> 01:20:50,837
- to have such a--
- Yeah! Yeah, I'm so lucky

1201
01:20:50,873 --> 01:20:52,814
I ought to buy
a lottery ticket, shouldn't l?

1202
01:20:52,856 --> 01:20:54,383
You're all just kind of
staring at the wall?

1203
01:20:54,425 --> 01:20:55,919
Is that what you're doing?

1204
01:20:55,961 --> 01:20:57,586
Hope can't save you.

1205
01:20:57,624 --> 01:20:59,054
You understand that?

1206
01:20:59,096 --> 01:21:01,616
It can't save you.
Or her

1207
01:21:01,657 --> 01:21:03,315
or her or him!

1208
01:21:03,352 --> 01:21:06,200
You understand that?
Hope isn't gonna save you!

1209
01:21:06,232 --> 01:21:08,621
You know that.

1210
01:21:08,664 --> 01:21:11,382
Please, Mr. Poole.

1211
01:21:15,064 --> 01:21:17,399
No no no no no no, please.
Listen to me!

1212
01:21:17,433 --> 01:21:19,822
Listen, it's a miracle.
It will do things--

1213
01:21:19,864 --> 01:21:22,231
No no no no--
this is a gift from God!

1214
01:21:22,265 --> 01:21:24,369
This is a gift from God!
No no-- oh my God.

1215
01:21:25,976 --> 01:21:28,432
I want this out of here!

1216
01:21:28,473 --> 01:21:30,861
I don't want this stain
on my wall!

1217
01:21:33,817 --> 01:21:35,855
I want--

1218
01:21:38,872 --> 01:21:41,293
This doesn't save lives.

1219
01:21:43,416 --> 01:21:44,911
Please.

1220
01:21:44,953 --> 01:21:47,024
This doesn't save lives.

1221
01:21:48,024 --> 01:21:52,017
# Oooh #

1222
01:21:54,520 --> 01:22:00,336
# Sweetly, child,
you sing #

1223
01:22:04,056 --> 01:22:07,285
# And all the joy #

1224
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,905
# You bring to me #

1225
01:22:12,856 --> 01:22:16,468
# Goes #

1226
01:22:19,703 --> 01:22:24,788
# Goes our
loved ones home #

1227
01:22:30,071 --> 01:22:32,079
# And I will-- #

1228
01:22:32,119 --> 01:22:36,177
# I will be waiting #

1229
01:22:40,472 --> 01:22:44,116
# On an ocean #

1230
01:22:47,031 --> 01:22:52,628
# Sweetly, child,
you sing #

1231
01:22:55,895 --> 01:22:59,278
# On an ocean... #

1232
01:22:59,319 --> 01:23:01,905
Mr. Poole?

1233
01:23:03,415 --> 01:23:08,085
# On an ocean... #

1234
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:09,613
Can you hear me?

1235
01:23:17,272 --> 01:23:21,548
Mr. Poole,
the blood was real.

1236
01:23:23,863 --> 01:23:27,311
# Ahhhhhhh#

1237
01:23:38,232 --> 01:23:43,152
# Sahhh   ahhh   ahhh #

1238
01:23:45,879 --> 01:23:50,451
#Sahhh   ahhh   ahhh.#

1239
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:57,813
Oh, God.

1240
01:23:59,479 --> 01:24:01,104
Thank God you're okay.

1241
01:24:03,798 --> 01:24:05,260
What are you
doing here?

1242
01:24:05,302 --> 01:24:08,434
I've been waiting
for you to wake up

1243
01:24:08,471 --> 01:24:11,188
to make sure you're okay.

1244
01:24:14,071 --> 01:24:16,143
...Dios mio.

1245
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:19,376
What are you smiling at?

1246
01:24:19,415 --> 01:24:22,165
At you.

1247
01:24:22,199 --> 01:24:25,046
Why did you not tell me,
Mr. Poole?

1248
01:24:25,079 --> 01:24:26,573
Tell you what?

1249
01:24:26,614 --> 01:24:28,437
About your secret
you had.

1250
01:24:28,471 --> 01:24:30,359
Dawn explained it to me.

1251
01:24:32,663 --> 01:24:34,419
What do you mean, "had"?

1252
01:24:34,454 --> 01:24:36,593
I need to see a doctor!

1253
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:38,965
You need to get back in your room.

1254
01:24:38,998 --> 01:24:40,591
- I need to see a doctor.
- Sir!

1255
01:24:40,631 --> 01:24:42,540
Mr. Poole, no no no.
You should not be walking around.

1256
01:24:42,582 --> 01:24:44,404
You need to get back to
your room-- hey hey!

1257
01:24:44,439 --> 01:24:47,156
Hey hey!
Mr. Poole.

1258
01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:49,743
Please-- okay.
Mr. Poole, just calm down.

1259
01:24:49,783 --> 01:24:52,652
Mr. Poole--

1260
01:24:52,694 --> 01:24:54,734
No no no no.
No no-- don't do that.

1261
01:24:54,774 --> 01:24:57,709
Mr. Poole, look at
your arm, Mr. Poole.

1262
01:24:57,751 --> 01:25:00,620
- You're bleeding.
- Mr. Poole.

1263
01:25:04,917 --> 01:25:06,860
Please.

1264
01:25:08,118 --> 01:25:09,907
Please.

1265
01:25:28,342 --> 01:25:31,026
Mr. Poole.

1266
01:25:31,989 --> 01:25:34,029
Wake up.

1267
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:36,590
Mr. Poole?
Wake up.

1268
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:39,565
It's okay.
Wake up.

1269
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:48,463
Millie, did you just
say something to me?

1270
01:25:48,502 --> 01:25:51,185
Mommy said
you're not sick anymore.

1271
01:25:57,430 --> 01:25:59,796
I'm--

1272
01:25:59,829 --> 01:26:01,837
I'm not gonna die?

1273
01:26:01,878 --> 01:26:03,666
No, Henry.

1274
01:26:03,702 --> 01:26:05,458
You're not.

1275
01:26:06,422 --> 01:26:07,949
How can that be?

1276
01:26:07,990 --> 01:26:11,285
Well, I told them what
was wrong with you

1277
01:26:11,317 --> 01:26:13,936
and they checked.
And you're fine.

1278
01:26:17,942 --> 01:26:19,982
You were never sick,
Henry.

1279
01:26:24,822 --> 01:26:28,596
So-- so I was
never gonna die?

1280
01:26:28,629 --> 01:26:31,694
No no, we are all going to die,

1281
01:26:31,733 --> 01:26:33,424
just not right now.

1282
01:26:33,461 --> 01:26:37,105
And that is the miracle

1283
01:26:37,141 --> 01:26:38,734
for you.

1284
01:26:41,173 --> 01:26:43,148
Um...

1285
01:26:43,189 --> 01:26:45,393
after what I've done,

1286
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:47,218
the miracle's gone.

1287
01:26:47,254 --> 01:26:49,425
No no no.

1288
01:26:49,461 --> 01:26:51,600
Don't worry about that.

1289
01:26:51,638 --> 01:26:54,506
It was here for as long

1290
01:26:54,548 --> 01:26:56,491
as it needed to be here.

1291
01:26:56,533 --> 01:26:57,995
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1292
01:26:58,037 --> 01:27:01,867
Like everything
and everyone.

1293
01:27:04,756 --> 01:27:07,506
I'm glad you're better,
Mr. Poole.

1294
01:27:11,189 --> 01:27:13,360
Millie,

1295
01:27:13,396 --> 01:27:15,185
I'm glad you're better too.

1296
01:27:22,037 --> 01:27:25,452
You know, you should really
get some rest.

1297
01:27:25,493 --> 01:27:27,380
Okay?

1298
01:27:27,412 --> 01:27:29,420
We'll be outside
if you need us.

1299
01:27:29,461 --> 01:27:31,249
Come on, honey.

1300
01:27:45,428 --> 01:27:49,901
# I promise you will
get old #

1301
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:54,348
# I promised you
everything #

1302
01:27:54,388 --> 01:27:59,145
# To protect you
wherever you go #

1303
01:27:59,188 --> 01:28:04,077
# I'll give you
this diamond ring #

1304
01:28:04,117 --> 01:28:09,267
# Just promise you
will remember #

1305
01:28:09,301 --> 01:28:12,649
# The promise should
last forever #

1306
01:28:14,228 --> 01:28:18,735
# Right up to
the dying embers #

1307
01:28:18,772 --> 01:28:22,601
# Of the fire that
burns so slow... #

1308
01:28:46,772 --> 01:28:49,161
- You're back.
- Yep.

1309
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:53,841
I'm home.

1310
01:28:53,876 --> 01:28:55,785
What's left of it.

1311
01:28:59,028 --> 01:29:00,489
What do you make
of all this?

1312
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:04,173
You're gonna live, Henry.

1313
01:29:04,212 --> 01:29:05,772
Yeah.

1314
01:29:05,811 --> 01:29:08,146
It's a gift.

1315
01:29:08,180 --> 01:29:09,391
Yeah.

1316
01:29:09,429 --> 01:29:11,370
Pretty miraculous, huh?

1317
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:16,915
I don't--
I don't know what it is.

1318
01:29:16,947 --> 01:29:19,599
I don't know
if it was a mistake.

1319
01:29:19,636 --> 01:29:21,130
I don't know.

1320
01:29:26,772 --> 01:29:29,357
I don't think that
any of this

1321
01:29:29,396 --> 01:29:30,890
was a mistake.

1322
01:29:35,861 --> 01:29:37,485
What now?

1323
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:08,430
# It's a beautiful
thing to do #

1324
01:30:10,195 --> 01:30:14,505
# Sometimes you just
have to walk away #

1325
01:30:14,547 --> 01:30:17,646
# Remember I do love you #

1326
01:30:19,476 --> 01:30:23,600
# Have courage in
what you say #

1327
01:30:23,635 --> 01:30:28,392
# And promise you will
remember #

1328
01:30:28,435 --> 01:30:32,874
# That promises
last forever #

1329
01:30:32,915 --> 01:30:37,618
# Still after
the dying embers #

1330
01:30:37,650 --> 01:30:42,259
# The fire that
burns so slowly #

1331
01:30:51,475 --> 01:30:54,856
# Sometimes you just
have to walk away #

1332
01:31:00,627 --> 01:31:04,205
# Sometimes you just
have to walk away #

1333
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:12,976
# Wishing today
was yesterday #

1334
01:31:18,739 --> 01:31:22,351
# Yes, sometimes you just
have to walk away. #

1335
01:31:22,739 --> 01:31:32,351
THE END
