3
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:10,633
A burn... A burn scar?

4
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:14,703
She should have a clear burn scar on her right shoulder.

5
00:00:14,934 --> 00:00:17,643
I spilled water on her by mistake while making formula...

6
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,503
and gave her a burn scar.

7
00:00:21,143 --> 00:00:23,273
Then Yuh Ri...

8
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:27,753
What's wrong? Joo Ho.

9
00:00:28,354 --> 00:00:29,683
Did you recall something?

10
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:32,954
Do you remember something about my daughter?

11
00:00:33,994 --> 00:00:35,854
Yul Mae. What are you doing here?

12
00:00:36,424 --> 00:00:39,363
Yul Mae. Why are you here during your time off?

13
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:41,734
- Let's talk outside. - Hae Joo.

14
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:43,564
Don't cut me off.

15
00:00:44,604 --> 00:00:45,604
Yul Mae.

16
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,034
You said you had something to confess about the design leak?

17
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:50,943
The thing is...

18
00:00:51,374 --> 00:00:54,244
Yul Mae. Don't hesitate. Please tell the truth.

19
00:00:54,543 --> 00:00:55,973
We need your testimony.

20
00:00:57,013 --> 00:00:58,613
How did our team's design...

21
00:00:58,814 --> 00:01:00,554
end up in the marketplace?

22
00:01:01,784 --> 00:01:02,984
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:03,723 --> 00:01:06,154
Ms. Koo Hae Joo made me do it, so I had no choice.

24
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:09,723
I copied our team's design and gave it to her.

25
00:01:19,303 --> 00:01:21,003
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.

26
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:24,743
Hae Joo threatened to divorce Moo Yul if I didn't do it.

27
00:01:25,074 --> 00:01:28,243
I couldn't have my brother get divorced because of me.

28
00:01:29,613 --> 00:01:31,314
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:31,643 --> 00:01:33,954
When did you give me the design?

30
00:01:34,014 --> 00:01:36,413
Is everything you said true?

31
00:01:36,753 --> 00:01:37,853
If you are lying,

32
00:01:38,023 --> 00:01:40,253
you will be held accountable.

33
00:01:40,454 --> 00:01:42,053
Yes, it's true.

34
00:01:42,124 --> 00:01:43,794
It's not fair, Mr. Chairman.

35
00:01:44,223 --> 00:01:45,964
Please don't fire me.

36
00:01:46,764 --> 00:01:48,693
And Hae Joo, please don't divorce Moo Yul.

37
00:01:49,434 --> 00:01:51,003
Stop lying!

38
00:01:52,803 --> 00:01:53,874
Dad.

39
00:01:54,273 --> 00:01:57,074
These jerks put her up to it.

40
00:01:57,174 --> 00:02:00,374
They made her lie and frame me.

41
00:02:00,443 --> 00:02:01,613
That's enough.

42
00:02:02,074 --> 00:02:03,273
Stop resisting,

43
00:02:03,544 --> 00:02:05,613
and ask for forgiveness.

44
00:02:05,943 --> 00:02:06,943
Hey, Yuh Ri.

45
00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:09,013
How dare you do this to me?

46
00:02:10,323 --> 00:02:13,353
Uncle. Do you want the company that badly?

47
00:02:14,823 --> 00:02:15,853
Tell me, Yul Mae.

48
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:18,323
Who made you say this?

49
00:02:18,994 --> 00:02:22,094
These people made you say that, didn't they?

50
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:23,464
Stop it, Hae Joo!

51
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:25,103
If it weren't Do Chi and Yuh Ri,

52
00:02:26,003 --> 00:02:27,334
was it my mom?

53
00:02:28,203 --> 00:02:31,703
Did she tell you to say I was behind it, when she did everything?

54
00:02:31,703 --> 00:02:32,804
That's not true.

55
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:35,144
I haven't even met Ms. Hong recently.

56
00:02:36,744 --> 00:02:39,714
Mom was responsible for the design leak all by herself.

57
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:41,253
I didn't know anything.

58
00:02:41,714 --> 00:02:42,753
Believe me.

59
00:02:42,883 --> 00:02:44,983
How could Ji Won have gotten the design?

60
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:47,124
It would've been impossible without your help.

61
00:02:47,394 --> 00:02:48,524
How would I know?

62
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:52,994
My mom does anything it takes, if there's something she wants.

63
00:02:52,994 --> 00:02:55,094
Hae Joo! Shut your mouth.

64
00:02:55,594 --> 00:02:57,404
If you insist you're innocent,

65
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:00,703
call your mom.

66
00:03:01,534 --> 00:03:02,934
Let's have everyone gathered here.

67
00:03:12,314 --> 00:03:14,814
Joo Ho. What do you remember?

68
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:17,624
Why did you ask about my missing child's burn scar?

69
00:03:18,383 --> 00:03:20,654
No. It can't be.

70
00:03:21,124 --> 00:03:23,024
Yuh Ri can't be Ji Won's daughter.

71
00:03:23,624 --> 00:03:25,894
Joo Ho. Anything is fine.

72
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:28,663
Tell me anything you remember, no matter how small.

73
00:03:29,064 --> 00:03:30,564
I must find my daughter.

74
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:33,103
My poor daughter...

75
00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:35,673
who almost froze to death on the hard, cold ground.

76
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:38,943
I need to find my daughter.

77
00:03:40,573 --> 00:03:41,573
Ji...

78
00:03:43,274 --> 00:03:44,314
Ji Won.

79
00:03:50,353 --> 00:03:52,883
- Hello? - Come to my office now.

80
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,624
What is it?

81
00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:56,994
I need to ask you something Come right now.

82
00:03:57,964 --> 00:03:59,594
Okay. I'm coming.

83
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:03,064
Joo Ho. Stay here for a bit.

84
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:05,034
I need to go to the office.

85
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,473
Don't go anywhere. You have to stay here, okay?

86
00:04:22,853 --> 00:04:23,853
This...

87
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:26,384
is Yuh Ri's baby picture.

88
00:04:28,024 --> 00:04:29,024
Then...

89
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:39,204
(Love Orphanage)

90
00:04:53,884 --> 00:04:54,954
Yuh Ri...

91
00:04:57,384 --> 00:04:59,784
Ji Won. Yuh Ri is your daughter.

92
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:01,923
The one you abandoned at Love Orphanage.

93
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,923
The daughter you think is dead!

94
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:35,553
That's right. I was in the accident while going to Ji Won...

95
00:05:35,694 --> 00:05:37,493
to tell her about Yuh Ri.

96
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:44,303
(100 Days)

97
00:05:45,034 --> 00:05:46,264
Yuh Ri really was...

98
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:48,634
Ji Won's daughter.

99
00:05:51,173 --> 00:05:53,004
Ji Won.

100
00:05:53,473 --> 00:05:54,514
Ji Won.

101
00:06:03,384 --> 00:06:04,884
Did something happen?

102
00:06:05,183 --> 00:06:06,553
The chairman asked me to come in.

103
00:06:06,853 --> 00:06:09,094
Hae Joo is in a very bad position.

104
00:06:09,594 --> 00:06:11,964
Yuh Ri brought proof that Hae Joo...

105
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:14,933
asked you to leak their design.

106
00:06:15,563 --> 00:06:18,733
- So? - Hae Joo is denying it.

107
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:21,534
She said you did it on your own.

108
00:06:22,204 --> 00:06:23,274
That's why...

109
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:26,074
Father called you here to talk to you and her together.

110
00:06:27,274 --> 00:06:28,274
Yuh Ri.

111
00:06:28,844 --> 00:06:31,243
How dare you try to hold Hae Joo back?

112
00:06:32,784 --> 00:06:34,514
Okay. Leave it to me.

113
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:38,853
Ji Won.

114
00:06:39,654 --> 00:06:41,723
- Ji Won! Ji Won. - Mr. Son.

115
00:06:42,123 --> 00:06:43,123
Moo Yul.

116
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:44,993
Get me Ji Won.

117
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:47,094
Ji Won.

118
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:52,933
Sit here.

119
00:07:01,243 --> 00:07:02,344
What is it?

120
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:04,043
Why did you call me here?

121
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:05,543
Ji Won.

122
00:07:06,043 --> 00:07:08,714
Tell the complete truth.

123
00:07:09,954 --> 00:07:11,324
Hae Joo asked you...

124
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:13,793
to leak our team's design, didn't she?

125
00:07:18,694 --> 00:07:19,694
Tell me.

126
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:21,793
Is it true that Hae Joo had you do it?

127
00:07:22,363 --> 00:07:24,103
Because she had to win?

128
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:27,034
Did she steal Do Chi's team's design and ask you...

129
00:07:27,373 --> 00:07:29,173
to flood the market with it?

130
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:31,644
Hae Joo.

131
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:38,483
This is my chance.

132
00:07:38,683 --> 00:07:40,553
I have to win Hae Joo over.

133
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:43,723
Well...

134
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,053
- The truth is... - What do you mean?

135
00:07:46,993 --> 00:07:48,493
Hae Joo asked me to do it?

136
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:55,894
She had nothing to do with it.

137
00:07:57,063 --> 00:08:01,034
Hae Joo never even mentioned your design to me.

138
00:08:02,574 --> 00:08:06,173
She was busy all the time working on her own design.

139
00:08:06,673 --> 00:08:08,144
Seeing her,

140
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,284
as a parent, I wanted to make sure she won.

141
00:08:13,014 --> 00:08:15,353
That's why I stole Yuh Ri's design.

142
00:08:17,154 --> 00:08:18,353
Stop lying.

143
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:20,723
You don't even work here.

144
00:08:20,723 --> 00:08:22,524
How did you get our design?

145
00:08:24,764 --> 00:08:26,824
Yul Mae, who gave Hae Joo the design,

146
00:08:26,824 --> 00:08:28,493
testified that she did it.

147
00:08:28,894 --> 00:08:30,534
I went to Yul Mae...

148
00:08:31,004 --> 00:08:33,303
and made her steal your design.

149
00:08:34,774 --> 00:08:36,374
So why did she say it was Hae Joo?

150
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:38,644
Did you put her up to it?

151
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:39,974
Did you make her lie?

152
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:45,484
- Ji Won! - Hey!

153
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,583
Ji Won.

154
00:08:51,284 --> 00:08:52,724
I need to see Ji Won.

155
00:08:53,793 --> 00:08:55,323
Why do you want to see her?

156
00:08:58,693 --> 00:08:59,693
But...

157
00:08:59,994 --> 00:09:01,534
what is that?

158
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:03,963
Ji Won's lost...

159
00:09:04,463 --> 00:09:05,663
Never mind.

160
00:09:06,134 --> 00:09:08,234
Ji Won should be here.

161
00:09:08,703 --> 00:09:11,573
I lost my cell phone.

162
00:09:11,703 --> 00:09:14,943
So please get her for me. It's urgent.

163
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:18,913
She just got here and left...

164
00:09:18,913 --> 00:09:20,183
with Hae Joo's father.

165
00:09:20,313 --> 00:09:21,654
She isn't here right now.

166
00:09:21,884 --> 00:09:24,154
Then call her for me.

167
00:09:24,453 --> 00:09:26,183
Tell her I have something urgent to tell her.

168
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:28,654
Tell her it's about her lost daughter.

169
00:09:37,134 --> 00:09:40,234
It seems like she isn't picking up.

170
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:41,474
She must have gone somewhere far.

171
00:09:42,203 --> 00:09:43,673
Really?

172
00:09:44,874 --> 00:09:47,014
Darn it. I have no choice.

173
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:51,284
I'll have to wait until I can reach her.

174
00:09:52,443 --> 00:09:53,543
Okay.

175
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,313
I'll go then.

176
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:01,154
The picture he was holding...

177
00:10:01,494 --> 00:10:03,663
looked like Yuh Ri's baby picture.

178
00:10:05,024 --> 00:10:08,234
Did he get his memory back?

179
00:10:15,173 --> 00:10:16,173
Fine.

180
00:10:16,734 --> 00:10:19,073
If you insist on lying, we have no choice.

181
00:10:20,274 --> 00:10:21,474
Ji Won.

182
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:24,014
We'll press charges against you for leaking our design.

183
00:10:24,244 --> 00:10:26,413
What? You'll press charges?

184
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:27,614
Yes.

185
00:10:27,953 --> 00:10:30,583
We have to get to the bottom of this in court.

186
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,284
Uncle. Yuh Ri.

187
00:10:35,154 --> 00:10:36,923
You're blinded by your greed to take over the company.

188
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:38,423
Will you sue your own family for it?

189
00:10:38,823 --> 00:10:41,534
Do you want to make a mockery of our family?

190
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:43,563
Do you think that will scare me...

191
00:10:43,764 --> 00:10:44,933
into backing off?

192
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:46,864
Not a chance!

193
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:49,333
Fine. Let's go to court.

194
00:10:49,634 --> 00:10:52,274
I'll prove Hae Joo's innocence.

195
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:55,514
Stop it, all of you!

196
00:10:55,843 --> 00:10:59,014
Unless you want to tell the world of our family's sordid problems,

197
00:10:59,343 --> 00:11:00,413
calm down.

198
00:11:01,553 --> 00:11:04,354
First, I'm canceling Do Chi's reassignment...

199
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:05,884
and Yuh Ri's termination.

200
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:08,154
The successorship decision...

201
00:11:08,823 --> 00:11:10,254
- is also canceled. - Dad!

202
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:12,894
I stole the design by myself.

203
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:14,864
Why is Hae Joo being punished for it?

204
00:11:15,163 --> 00:11:17,004
You said so yourself,

205
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:20,203
that you'll give the company to the winner of this contest.

206
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:22,573
Make it clear that Hae Joo...

207
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:23,943
will take over Wid Group!

208
00:11:24,104 --> 00:11:25,803
Stop it, Ji Won!

209
00:11:26,043 --> 00:11:27,543
We can't let you...

210
00:11:27,913 --> 00:11:30,073
decide who will succeed the chairman like this.

211
00:11:30,073 --> 00:11:32,413
Enough! Everyone get out.

212
00:11:33,144 --> 00:11:34,484
Go back to your offices!

213
00:11:45,193 --> 00:11:46,224
Ji Won.

214
00:11:48,963 --> 00:11:52,634
How long do you think you can protect Hae Joo as your daughter?

215
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,534
We'll be watching.

216
00:11:56,534 --> 00:11:58,173
Act like an adult. Please.

217
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:01,213
Hiding behind your mother's back and doing evil deeds.

218
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:02,573
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

219
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:14,053
Thanks Mom.

220
00:12:14,553 --> 00:12:16,854
I didn't know you would stay by my side.

221
00:12:18,063 --> 00:12:19,293
I told you.

222
00:12:19,624 --> 00:12:21,134
I'm always on your side.

223
00:12:22,134 --> 00:12:23,134
I'm sorry...

224
00:12:23,703 --> 00:12:25,004
for hurting your feelings.

225
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:28,303
I don't care what happens to me as long as you're okay.

226
00:12:29,534 --> 00:12:31,974
As long as my Hae Joo is happy and successful,

227
00:12:32,343 --> 00:12:33,774
that's good enough for me.

228
00:12:35,443 --> 00:12:37,443
I'll talk to Dad...

229
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,213
to let you move back home.

230
00:12:39,413 --> 00:12:41,014
Okay. Thanks.

231
00:12:42,183 --> 00:12:44,553
Don't worry. As long as I'm around,

232
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:46,524
I'll protect you all the way.

233
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:49,793
I'll make sure Yuh Ri won't drag you down.

234
00:12:51,024 --> 00:12:53,494
Fine. Strangle your own daughter...

235
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,933
with your very own hands.

236
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:58,604
So cruel, that she can't even breathe.

237
00:13:00,234 --> 00:13:03,374
Even still, I will never forgive you.

238
00:13:07,374 --> 00:13:09,943
They say one mistake is more of an experience.

239
00:13:10,343 --> 00:13:12,413
You repented and confessed,

240
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:13,713
so it'll be fine.

241
00:13:14,413 --> 00:13:15,583
What are you babbling about?

242
00:13:15,984 --> 00:13:18,053
Are you judging me?

243
00:13:18,884 --> 00:13:20,793
She's stupid, but it's okay because she's pretty.

244
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:25,923
Yuh Ri.

245
00:13:26,894 --> 00:13:28,894
Am I fired now?

246
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,063
Mr. Koo. Will you fire me?

247
00:13:32,504 --> 00:13:34,504
Will I be unemployed again?

248
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,374
Go home for now.

249
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,073
You're still on vacation.

250
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,673
Thanks for having the courage to come.

251
00:13:41,343 --> 00:13:42,843
Mr. Koo will do all he can,

252
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,583
to prevent your termination.

253
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,083
Really?

254
00:13:47,913 --> 00:13:50,524
You mean it? Will you really, sir?

255
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,354
Mr. Koo is a man of his words.

256
00:13:53,654 --> 00:13:54,724
You can trust him.

257
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,423
- What is he saying now? - Let's go.

258
00:14:04,764 --> 00:14:05,764
Ji Won...

259
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,474
really loves her daughter.

260
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,573
It's like an obsession.

261
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:13,303
Protecting and covering up a child's wrongdoings...

262
00:14:13,474 --> 00:14:15,173
isn't true motherly love.

263
00:14:15,774 --> 00:14:16,813
It's sad.

264
00:14:23,254 --> 00:14:24,784
Did that child...

265
00:14:25,683 --> 00:14:28,154
have a unique mark or anything on her body?

266
00:14:29,224 --> 00:14:31,994
- Like a birthmark, or... - A scar.

267
00:14:32,624 --> 00:14:34,034
She had a burn scar.

268
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:37,463
A burn... A burn scar?

269
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,034
Joo Ho...

270
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:43,673
definitely remembered something about my lost child.

271
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,854
(Hong Ji Won)

272
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,624
Why isn't he picking up?

273
00:15:02,453 --> 00:15:04,163
I have to see him...

274
00:15:04,423 --> 00:15:05,864
while he still remembers.

275
00:15:09,394 --> 00:15:10,663
How did it go?

276
00:15:10,663 --> 00:15:12,404
Did you tell them the truth?

277
00:15:12,404 --> 00:15:15,404
You told them that Hae Joo made you do it, right?

278
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:17,073
What choice did I have?

279
00:15:17,343 --> 00:15:19,904
It shows on my face if I lie.

280
00:15:20,974 --> 00:15:22,813
Good. Good job.

281
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,244
You can't live with that on your conscience.

282
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:27,354
It's better to take your punishment sooner than later.

283
00:15:27,713 --> 00:15:29,053
Actually. Here.

284
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:31,083
Drink this.

285
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,284
If you're going to punished more,

286
00:15:33,354 --> 00:15:35,654
you'll need your energy. Here.

287
00:15:37,063 --> 00:15:38,063
Drink.

288
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,663
- Mom! - Drink more. Good.

289
00:15:45,563 --> 00:15:46,604
Welcome home.

290
00:15:49,604 --> 00:15:51,673
What are you doing here?

291
00:15:51,874 --> 00:15:54,244
It's been 30 years, but my home is still the same.

292
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,413
What's wrong with me from coming here?

293
00:15:55,573 --> 00:15:57,843
You must be hungry. Let's eat.

294
00:16:00,654 --> 00:16:02,713
Why aren't you coming? The food is getting cold.

295
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,254
Sit down.

296
00:16:07,553 --> 00:16:10,093
I made some American food. I hope you like it.

297
00:16:10,663 --> 00:16:11,823
What are you doing?

298
00:16:12,063 --> 00:16:14,634
What right do you have to touch our kitchen?

299
00:16:14,634 --> 00:16:17,063
Be considerate of the person who cooked and sit.

300
00:16:17,104 --> 00:16:18,864
Don't embarrass me in front of the kids.

301
00:16:20,163 --> 00:16:23,333
Don't get any ideas. You aren't our family.

302
00:16:23,673 --> 00:16:26,504
You and I split up over 30 years ago.

303
00:16:26,673 --> 00:16:29,774
Yes, you and I may not be family,

304
00:16:29,774 --> 00:16:31,244
but I'm still Hae Joo's mom.

305
00:16:31,443 --> 00:16:33,384
She accepted me as her mom.

306
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:35,884
That gives me the right to at least touch the kitchen.

307
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,624
Anyway, the position as your wife is vacant right now.

308
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:43,724
You're going to divorce Ji Won too.

309
00:16:43,724 --> 00:16:44,764
Mee Hee!

310
00:16:46,124 --> 00:16:47,234
That's enough, Dad.

311
00:16:48,193 --> 00:16:50,504
Regardless, she gave birth to me.

312
00:16:50,703 --> 00:16:52,404
And she came back for me.

313
00:16:54,104 --> 00:16:55,774
What happened to this family?

314
00:16:56,234 --> 00:16:58,573
I don't know how to face my father after I die.

315
00:17:04,984 --> 00:17:05,984
Thank you.

316
00:17:06,514 --> 00:17:07,914
What will happen now?

317
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:09,383
Is she living with us?

318
00:17:10,214 --> 00:17:11,254
That's fine too.

319
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:15,793
Good. Your dad is in a bad mood,

320
00:17:15,954 --> 00:17:17,093
so I'll go for now.

321
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:18,623
I'll move in another day.

322
00:17:19,823 --> 00:17:22,964
That's right. I'll go to the office tomorrow.

323
00:17:22,994 --> 00:17:24,333
I need to discuss something with you.

324
00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:27,274
Discuss? What do you need to discuss with me?

325
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:31,103
I will be giving you wings.

326
00:17:31,603 --> 00:17:33,073
To my daughter, Hae Joo,

327
00:17:33,744 --> 00:17:36,214
as your mom and a designer.

328
00:17:39,284 --> 00:17:42,254
Welcome home, Mommy and Great-uncle.

329
00:17:42,254 --> 00:17:43,553
Hi, Bom.

330
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:45,353
Did you have a good day?

331
00:17:45,883 --> 00:17:47,994
Were you watching TV? Did you finish your homework?

332
00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:50,823
I had way too much homework today.

333
00:17:50,823 --> 00:17:52,363
But I finished. So I'm playing.

334
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,063
Pat me on the bottom.

335
00:17:55,764 --> 00:17:58,264
My good girl. You're the best.

336
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,734
I should spend a lot of time with you tonight.

337
00:18:03,643 --> 00:18:06,643
My schoolbag. I didn't pack my schoolbag yet.

338
00:18:08,643 --> 00:18:11,043
- You're home. - Yes. We're back.

339
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:12,744
How did it go at the office?

340
00:18:14,014 --> 00:18:17,083
We exposed Hae Joo for the design leak.

341
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:19,924
She insisted it wasn't her,

342
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:22,194
and Ji Won took the blame for everything.

343
00:18:22,454 --> 00:18:23,924
But we don't believe them.

344
00:18:24,464 --> 00:18:26,694
I got another chance to win successorship.

345
00:18:27,363 --> 00:18:29,464
But is Father not home?

346
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,333
No. He went out in the afternoon but hasn't come home yet.

347
00:18:32,764 --> 00:18:36,534
Actually, he said something odd before he left.

348
00:18:37,174 --> 00:18:38,303
Something odd?

349
00:18:38,303 --> 00:18:42,174
That he thinks he'll remember something important very soon.

350
00:18:42,373 --> 00:18:43,444
That's what he said.

351
00:18:44,113 --> 00:18:45,883
He'll remember something important?

352
00:18:47,113 --> 00:18:49,053
I'll check the area for him.

353
00:18:49,383 --> 00:18:50,383
Okay.

354
00:19:11,974 --> 00:19:13,643
Why isn't Ji Won coming home?

355
00:19:14,474 --> 00:19:16,373
Yuh Ri will be worried.

356
00:19:21,214 --> 00:19:24,454
I'm sorry, but may I borrow a pen and some paper?

357
00:19:24,524 --> 00:19:25,553
Sure. Here you are.

358
00:19:25,684 --> 00:19:26,784
Thank you.

359
00:19:32,194 --> 00:19:33,194
Call me.

360
00:19:33,593 --> 00:19:35,093
I remember who your daughter is.

361
00:19:35,593 --> 00:19:36,633
Joo Ho.

362
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:43,303
The person you have reached is unavailable.

363
00:19:44,343 --> 00:19:46,474
Why can't I reach Joo Ho?

364
00:19:47,274 --> 00:19:49,543
I have to talk to him while he remembers.

365
00:19:51,514 --> 00:19:52,514
Forget this.

366
00:20:06,863 --> 00:20:09,264
Why does that hyena...

367
00:20:09,264 --> 00:20:11,063
keep crawling back here?

368
00:20:11,664 --> 00:20:12,764
Who is it?

369
00:20:13,974 --> 00:20:16,573
Joo Ho!

370
00:20:16,803 --> 00:20:18,643
Has she lost her mind?

371
00:20:19,373 --> 00:20:21,974
She needs a salt shower for sure.

372
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:24,043
Wait.

373
00:20:25,984 --> 00:20:27,083
Where's Joo Hoo?

374
00:20:27,284 --> 00:20:29,284
Joo Ho!

375
00:20:29,684 --> 00:20:31,184
Why are you looking for my father?

376
00:20:31,383 --> 00:20:33,284
- What are you trying to do to him? - Move.

377
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:35,454
Joo Ho. Joo Ho!

378
00:20:36,093 --> 00:20:38,563
- Joo Ho. - What do you think you're doing?

379
00:20:38,793 --> 00:20:39,964
Where's Joo Ho?

380
00:20:39,994 --> 00:20:41,934
Why are you looking for my father?

381
00:20:41,964 --> 00:20:43,934
I need to see him right away.

382
00:20:43,964 --> 00:20:45,303
I have something to ask him.

383
00:20:45,764 --> 00:20:48,534
Not only is he not here, but even if he were,

384
00:20:48,803 --> 00:20:50,803
I wouldn't let you see him.

385
00:20:51,603 --> 00:20:53,643
Get out before I call the police!

386
00:20:53,813 --> 00:20:56,143
Your father knows about my daughter.

387
00:20:56,313 --> 00:20:57,744
He got his memory back!

388
00:20:59,284 --> 00:21:01,414
- He got his memory back? - That's right!

389
00:21:01,954 --> 00:21:03,613
Your father came to me.

390
00:21:04,424 --> 00:21:06,323
He remembered that my child...

391
00:21:06,323 --> 00:21:09,323
had a scar and came to see me.

392
00:21:09,954 --> 00:21:11,994
I have to see him right away...

393
00:21:11,994 --> 00:21:13,293
before he forgets again!

394
00:21:14,593 --> 00:21:16,264
After all you did to torment us,

395
00:21:16,464 --> 00:21:18,934
you're begging my father to help you find your child?

396
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,234
Find your daughter on your own.

397
00:21:22,303 --> 00:21:23,504
Leave my father alone.

398
00:21:24,343 --> 00:21:26,244
And get out of here.

399
00:21:26,974 --> 00:21:28,914
If you barge in here again,

400
00:21:29,573 --> 00:21:32,313
I'll press charges for trespassing.

401
00:21:41,893 --> 00:21:43,664
The person you have reached...

402
00:21:47,363 --> 00:21:49,363
Where can I find Joo Ho?

403
00:21:50,803 --> 00:21:52,903
Why won't he answer his phone?

404
00:22:09,883 --> 00:22:11,284
Where did you go?

405
00:22:11,323 --> 00:22:13,053
Do you know how worried the family was?

406
00:22:13,383 --> 00:22:15,424
I was looking in the area for you too.

407
00:22:15,924 --> 00:22:18,264
Sorry. Let's go in.

408
00:22:19,224 --> 00:22:22,563
Don't tell my father that Ji Won was here.

409
00:22:23,164 --> 00:22:25,863
It'll stress him out, rather than help him get his memory back.

410
00:22:26,363 --> 00:22:27,803
Of course I won't.

411
00:22:29,403 --> 00:22:30,403
Father.

412
00:22:33,403 --> 00:22:35,143
Where were you?

413
00:22:35,244 --> 00:22:37,214
We were worried because we couldn't reach you.

414
00:22:37,343 --> 00:22:39,343
He left his phone somewhere.

415
00:22:39,343 --> 00:22:40,353
Gosh.

416
00:22:40,553 --> 00:22:43,184
Were you worried? Sorry.

417
00:22:43,984 --> 00:22:46,853
I haven't been myself all day.

418
00:22:46,954 --> 00:22:48,653
Is something wrong?

419
00:22:50,424 --> 00:22:51,823
No.

420
00:22:52,393 --> 00:22:53,524
It's nothing.

421
00:22:55,494 --> 00:22:57,563
Excuse me. I'm going to bed first.

422
00:22:57,563 --> 00:22:58,563
Sure.

423
00:23:22,153 --> 00:23:23,254
My daughter.

424
00:23:24,024 --> 00:23:25,363
Where are you?

425
00:23:35,274 --> 00:23:36,403
Ji Won.

426
00:23:36,603 --> 00:23:38,403
Help me pick out a tie.

427
00:23:38,944 --> 00:23:40,873
Ji Won. Ji...

428
00:23:43,113 --> 00:23:44,643
She isn't here anymore.

429
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:46,414
Come in.

430
00:23:49,684 --> 00:23:50,684
What is this?

431
00:23:50,883 --> 00:23:53,524
It's what the madam prepared for you every morning.

432
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,393
She made me promise not to forget it.

433
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:06,103
What do you plan to do now?

434
00:24:06,603 --> 00:24:08,474
Will you really kick Mother out of this house...

435
00:24:08,603 --> 00:24:10,004
and let your birth mother in?

436
00:24:10,444 --> 00:24:11,974
That wouldn't be enough.

437
00:24:12,504 --> 00:24:13,974
I have a plan.

438
00:24:15,043 --> 00:24:17,613
You can't keep anything from me.

439
00:24:17,714 --> 00:24:19,343
That's the only way I can help.

440
00:24:20,714 --> 00:24:24,053
Mr. Son's visit to the office yesterday really bothers me.

441
00:24:26,024 --> 00:24:28,093
Mr. Son came to the office?

442
00:24:28,153 --> 00:24:31,093
He was looking for Mother while you were in the chairman's office.

443
00:24:31,764 --> 00:24:34,494
He had a picture of her with a baby,

444
00:24:34,893 --> 00:24:37,034
and I think it was Yuh Ri.

445
00:24:37,303 --> 00:24:38,434
A picture?

446
00:24:42,204 --> 00:24:43,303
Do you see this?

447
00:24:44,643 --> 00:24:46,774
- What is that? - Give that back!

448
00:24:48,073 --> 00:24:51,143
It's a picture of the real daughter of that woman whom you call "Mom."

449
00:24:52,214 --> 00:24:53,484
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

450
00:24:54,883 --> 00:24:55,954
You're right.

451
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,383
That's Yuh Ri's baby picture.

452
00:24:59,184 --> 00:25:00,724
If he saw it,

453
00:25:01,454 --> 00:25:03,254
he must know it was her.

454
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,893
If he was looking for Mom after seeing that...

455
00:25:08,434 --> 00:25:10,964
No. We can't let them meet.

456
00:25:19,103 --> 00:25:20,744
Did she not see my note?

457
00:25:22,143 --> 00:25:23,573
If she had,

458
00:25:24,214 --> 00:25:27,083
she would've come here or at least contacted me...

459
00:25:28,353 --> 00:25:29,914
through someone else.

460
00:25:30,754 --> 00:25:31,883
Grandpa.

461
00:25:32,924 --> 00:25:33,924
Bom.

462
00:25:35,153 --> 00:25:37,664
Didn't you go to school today?

463
00:25:38,093 --> 00:25:39,994
It's our school's anniversary.

464
00:25:40,494 --> 00:25:41,593
It is?

465
00:25:43,363 --> 00:25:44,363
Bom.

466
00:25:44,764 --> 00:25:47,603
Do you have your grandma's phone number?

467
00:25:48,073 --> 00:25:50,744
I lost my phone,

468
00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:53,444
so I don't have her number.

469
00:25:53,774 --> 00:25:55,113
Mokdong Grandma?

470
00:25:55,313 --> 00:25:57,784
No. Ga Ya's grandma.

471
00:25:59,484 --> 00:26:02,284
- I'm scared of her. - What?

472
00:26:03,383 --> 00:26:05,924
Why are you scared of her?

473
00:26:08,393 --> 00:26:10,093
You don't have to be scared of her.

474
00:26:11,593 --> 00:26:14,034
She's your real grandmother.

475
00:26:15,034 --> 00:26:16,034
What?

476
00:26:16,464 --> 00:26:18,734
Once she finds out...

477
00:26:18,734 --> 00:26:20,934
that you are her one and only real grandchild,

478
00:26:21,474 --> 00:26:23,674
she'll love you a lot from now on.

479
00:26:26,373 --> 00:26:28,214
I'll explain later.

480
00:26:29,244 --> 00:26:31,543
So do you have her number?

481
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:34,883
I do. Just a minute.

482
00:26:37,754 --> 00:26:40,123
Although the design launch failed because of what happened,

483
00:26:40,123 --> 00:26:42,454
since the chairman pushed off deciding his successor,

484
00:26:43,153 --> 00:26:45,563
I'm sure that he will give another mission soon.

485
00:26:47,194 --> 00:26:49,563
Excluding the items we worked on with Angela Choi,

486
00:26:49,593 --> 00:26:52,333
we have designs that we developed solely on our own,

487
00:26:52,803 --> 00:26:54,234
so let's start over with those.

488
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,744
- Hello, Father. - Hi, Yuh Ri.

489
00:27:01,043 --> 00:27:02,313
I have good news.

490
00:27:02,813 --> 00:27:03,813
Good news?

491
00:27:04,284 --> 00:27:06,484
Oh Ki Sup requested a visit.

492
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:08,014
He wants to meet with us.

493
00:27:09,214 --> 00:27:12,083
I'll head there first. Meet me there right away.

494
00:27:12,623 --> 00:27:14,323
Okay. I'll leave now.

495
00:27:15,724 --> 00:27:16,754
What is it?

496
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,994
Oh Ki Sup requests for a visit. He wants to see us.

497
00:27:20,434 --> 00:27:22,934
He must have had a change of heart.

498
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:29,504
Why is this here?

499
00:27:30,543 --> 00:27:33,974
So this was why I couldn't reach Joo Ho yesterday.

500
00:27:35,143 --> 00:27:36,914
Seriously. Oh no.

501
00:27:37,613 --> 00:27:38,643
Oh no.

502
00:27:41,754 --> 00:27:42,754
Mom.

503
00:27:43,653 --> 00:27:44,653
Mom.

504
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:00,833
Hae Joo. What brings you here?

505
00:28:01,434 --> 00:28:03,034
It's nothing much.

506
00:28:04,403 --> 00:28:05,843
I thought it over,

507
00:28:05,873 --> 00:28:08,274
and I felt bad kicking you out like that yesterday.

508
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:11,514
I wanted to talk over some tea.

509
00:28:11,813 --> 00:28:13,444
- Is that okay? - Really?

510
00:28:14,184 --> 00:28:16,353
I was just about to step out.

511
00:28:17,684 --> 00:28:21,123
Do you want to wait here? Let me change first.

512
00:28:40,103 --> 00:28:41,113
Call me.

513
00:28:41,514 --> 00:28:43,073
I remember who your daughter is.

514
00:28:43,444 --> 00:28:44,543
Joo Ho.

515
00:28:47,414 --> 00:28:50,984
I left a note and a voicemail about Yuh Ri.

516
00:28:51,254 --> 00:28:52,353
Why won't she call?

517
00:28:52,724 --> 00:28:54,524
Did she not get them?

518
00:29:05,563 --> 00:29:07,434
He got his memory back.

519
00:29:08,403 --> 00:29:10,903
I can't let them meet each other.

520
00:29:19,244 --> 00:29:21,813
- Is someone here? - What?

521
00:29:22,714 --> 00:29:25,024
I think someone's just pulling a prank.

522
00:29:25,254 --> 00:29:27,153
It's okay. I'll go out and check.

523
00:29:33,093 --> 00:29:34,264
Hae... Hae Joo.

524
00:29:34,793 --> 00:29:37,234
- What are you doing here? - Where's your mom?

525
00:29:37,964 --> 00:29:40,434
I have something to tell your mom. It's urgent.

526
00:29:40,434 --> 00:29:41,873
I have something to tell you too.

527
00:29:42,204 --> 00:29:43,204
Talk to me first.

528
00:29:43,204 --> 00:29:44,873
If it isn't urgent,

529
00:29:45,004 --> 00:29:46,643
let's talk after I talk to...

530
00:29:46,643 --> 00:29:47,674
It's urgent too.

531
00:29:48,373 --> 00:29:49,774
It's about my mom's daughter.

532
00:29:50,684 --> 00:29:52,043
Her real daughter.

533
00:29:53,184 --> 00:29:54,184
What?

534
00:29:55,914 --> 00:29:57,424
You are going to sue Ji won, right?

535
00:29:57,823 --> 00:30:00,123
She broke her promise to get me out.

536
00:30:00,653 --> 00:30:02,524
So I can't sit back and do nothing.

537
00:30:03,454 --> 00:30:05,093
I'll confess everything she did...

538
00:30:05,393 --> 00:30:06,593
to Son Joo Ho.

539
00:30:06,694 --> 00:30:07,793
What a relief...

540
00:30:08,293 --> 00:30:09,793
to see Oh Ki Sup change his mind.

541
00:30:10,704 --> 00:30:11,704
It is.

542
00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:14,873
Now that he's completely on our side,

543
00:30:15,204 --> 00:30:18,603
Ji Won won't be able to worm her way out.

544
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:22,974
It turns out that she is living with Hae Joo after moving out.

545
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:25,613
Let's go.

546
00:30:25,843 --> 00:30:28,514
I wonder what that brazen woman will say.

547
00:30:33,954 --> 00:30:35,053
What is it?

548
00:30:35,653 --> 00:30:36,924
What do you plan to tell my mom?

549
00:30:39,123 --> 00:30:41,393
Do you plan to tell her that Yuh Ri is her real daughter?

550
00:30:42,534 --> 00:30:43,633
Hae Joo.

551
00:30:44,534 --> 00:30:45,863
You knew?

552
00:30:46,034 --> 00:30:47,133
Don't tell her.

553
00:30:47,934 --> 00:30:50,603
What's the point now? What's the use?

554
00:30:51,303 --> 00:30:53,373
They were strangers to each other for over 30 years.

555
00:30:53,543 --> 00:30:55,514
They've been sworn enemies.

556
00:30:56,073 --> 00:30:58,984
Why does it matter now that they're mother and child?

557
00:30:59,014 --> 00:31:01,014
That's why she must know.

558
00:31:02,353 --> 00:31:04,454
We have to sweep away all the hatred...

559
00:31:04,883 --> 00:31:06,853
that is between them.

560
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,353
- They're blood. - Mr. Son.

561
00:31:09,694 --> 00:31:12,464
I need to stop them from hurting each other any further.

562
00:31:12,964 --> 00:31:15,664
- They need to know. - No.

563
00:31:17,004 --> 00:31:19,103
Let them live in ignorance as they have been.

564
00:31:20,234 --> 00:31:21,504
Just tell Yuh Ri...

565
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:23,674
to move to another country with Uncle Do Chi and Bom.

566
00:31:24,543 --> 00:31:26,403
If they don't see each other, they won't be able to fight anymore.

567
00:31:27,914 --> 00:31:28,914
Mr. Son.

568
00:31:29,613 --> 00:31:31,113
Please help me.

569
00:31:32,883 --> 00:31:36,254
You know how important my mom is to me.

570
00:31:38,224 --> 00:31:41,823
I don't want to lose my mom to Yuh Ri.

571
00:31:47,164 --> 00:31:48,264
Hae Joo.

572
00:31:49,063 --> 00:31:50,063
Hae Joo?

573
00:31:51,303 --> 00:31:52,534
Where did she go?

574
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,803
A voicemail?

575
00:31:59,843 --> 00:32:01,113
Who is it from?

576
00:32:04,284 --> 00:32:05,313
Ji Won, it's me.

577
00:32:05,643 --> 00:32:08,383
I remember everything about your daughter.

578
00:32:35,543 --> 00:32:36,543
Look.

579
00:32:37,944 --> 00:32:39,113
Do you know what this is?

580
00:32:40,914 --> 00:32:44,553
I'm pressing charges against you for faking my father's death,

581
00:32:44,984 --> 00:32:46,724
abduction, and false imprisonment.

582
00:32:47,524 --> 00:32:49,553
Oh Ki Sup agreed to testify in court...

583
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:51,524
to everything you did.

584
00:32:52,164 --> 00:32:54,464
You can't get out of it this time.

585
00:32:57,803 --> 00:32:58,803
You...

586
00:33:00,264 --> 00:33:03,073
are finished now.

587
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,613
Please, I'm begging you. Don't tell her.

588
00:33:11,883 --> 00:33:14,053
I don't mean forever. Just not now.

589
00:33:14,653 --> 00:33:17,053
Please wait. Give me some time.

590
00:33:21,123 --> 00:33:22,123
No.

591
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:24,464
I can't do that.

592
00:33:26,194 --> 00:33:28,994
I have no right to keep them apart.

593
00:33:30,303 --> 00:33:33,734
They've been apart for 30 years. That's already too long.

594
00:33:35,234 --> 00:33:37,073
I can't delay any longer.

595
00:33:40,714 --> 00:33:43,373
I asked and pleaded with you,

596
00:33:44,613 --> 00:33:47,214
- but you'll tell my mom? - Ji Won...

597
00:33:49,383 --> 00:33:51,083
didn't know Yuh Ri was her daughter...

598
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:55,093
and did all sorts of terrible things to her.

599
00:33:56,494 --> 00:33:58,593
I must stop it before she does anything worse.

600
00:33:59,363 --> 00:34:01,393
She must get on her knees...

601
00:34:01,393 --> 00:34:03,964
and beg Yuh Ri for forgiveness before it is too late.

602
00:34:05,903 --> 00:34:07,774
That's what's best for Ji Won.

603
00:34:10,943 --> 00:34:12,974
No! You can't go.

604
00:34:13,244 --> 00:34:14,874
You can't go to my mom!

605
00:34:15,044 --> 00:34:16,713
- Hae Joo. - No!

606
00:34:17,744 --> 00:34:19,044
For their entire lives,

607
00:34:19,784 --> 00:34:21,514
they must never know that they are mother and child.

608
00:34:21,514 --> 00:34:22,584
That's...

609
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:25,724
my revenge for my dead son.
